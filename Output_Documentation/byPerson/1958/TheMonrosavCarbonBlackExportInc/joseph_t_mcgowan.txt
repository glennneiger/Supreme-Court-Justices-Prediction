mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
in
this
case,
an
italian
ship
owner
issued
27
bills
of
lading
at
united
states
ports
of
loading
houston,
texas
and
new
orleans,
louisiana.
these
bills
of
lading
were
issued
with
the
purpose
of
covering
a
shipment
of
some
30,000
bags
of
carbon
black
from
those
ports
to
various
ports
in
italy.
prior
to
the
execution
and
the
issuance
of
those
bills
of
lading,
the
italian
ship
owner
inserted
a
clause
in
that
bill
of
lading
which
is
substance
provided
that
in
the
event
that
any
dispute
arose
under
the
bill
of
lading
that
that
dispute
must
be
litigated
in
the
courts
of
genoa
--
genoa,
italy
exclusively.
the
assertion
of
that
bill
of
lading
or
that
clause
in
the
bill
of
lading
gives
rise
to
the
two
questions
now
before
the
court.
the
first
question
is,
is
that
clause
valid
and
enforceable
against
an
american
citizen?
and
the
second
is
whether
the
prohibition
of
a
legal
action
against
the
captain
or
ship
owner
or
their
agents
includes
an
action
in
rem
or
an
action
against
the
carrying
vessel
itself.
sense
the
issuance
of
the
bill
of
lading
and
that
document
is
a
very
important
feature
in
this
case.
i
think
perhaps
we
take
--
we
should
take
a
minute
or
two
to
discuss
briefly
the
background
of
a
shipment
going
from
the
united
states
to
foreign
port.
usually
there
are
three
parties
involved.
you
have
the
american
producer,
the
manufacturer
of
the
goods.
you
have
the
far
consumer
and
you
have
the
intermediary
ocean
carrier.
usually
the
procedure
and
the
consumer
get
together
and
arrange
for
the
delivery
of
certain
specified
amount
of
cargo
to
be
delivered
at
a
certain
specified
date
in
a
foreign
port.
thereupon
the
american
producer,
even
through
its
own
traffic
department
or
through
its
agents,
usually
a
freight
forwarder
contacts
various
steamship
companies
who
have
or
which
have
vessels
going
to
the
port
of
destination.
these
steamship
companies
are
not
very
hard
to
contact
because
they
have
their
own
solicitors,
their
own
salesman
who
are
constantly
contacting
shippers
of
cargo.
the
ship
owner
who
has
a
ship
available,
who
will
meet
the
date
agreed
upon
by
the
producer
and
the
consumer
is
chosen.
and
arrangements
are
made
for
the
shipment
of
the
cargo
to
arrive
at
the
port
of
loading
in
time
to
meet
the
vessel
so
that
the
vessel
concerned
can
arrive
in
time
at
the
foreign
port.
when
the
cargo
arrives
at
the
ports
of
loading
in
the
united
states,
they
are
received
for
by
the
carrier.
and
when
they
are
loaded
on
board
the
carrier's
vessel,
thereupon
a
bill
of
lading
has
issued.
now
what
is
a
bill
of
lading?
a
bill
of
lading
is
loosely
called
a
contract.
but
is
it
--
it
is
an
important
commercial
document
because
it
is
an
acknowledgement
by
the
ocean
carrier
that
it
has
received
the
certain
amount
of
cargo
and
of
course
it
enables
the
consumer
to
obtain
delivery
of
that
cargo
when
the
cargo
arrives
at
following
port.
now
oftentimes
a
shipment
never
sees
a
bill
of
lading
until
it
is
signed
by
the
carrier
or
its
agents
at
the
port
of
loading.
it
is
not
a
contract
in
the
usual
sense.
that
is,
two
people
do
not
sit
down
over
a
table
and
discuss
the
terms
of
carriage.
this
bill
of
lading
has
been
printed
and
used
by
the
carrier
for
a
number
of
years
in
its
business,
and
everytime
there
is
a
favorable
decision
for
the
carrier
issued
by
the
court,
you
can
be
sure
that
that
clause
or
it's
concern
which
is
going
to
give
the
carrier
that
benefit,
is
inserted
in
this
bill
of
lading.
now
this
bill
of
lading
is
about
legal
size
cap
and
i
can
demonstrate.
and
this
one,
one
of
these
bills
of
lading
which
issued
in
this
case
contains
besides
the
usual
acknowledgement
of
receipt
of
a
cargo,
39
printed
clauses.
you
cannot
read
these
clauses
unless
you
want
to
strain
your
eyes
without
a
magnifying
glass.
now
the
courts
of
our
country
have
called
a
bill
of
lading
a
contract
of
adhesion.
that
is,
a
shipper
of
the
cargo
has
no
alternative
but
to
accept
the
bill
of
lading
and
to
adhere
to
its
terms.
it
is
not
a
contract
issued
at
the
negotiation.
now
applying
to
those
facts
to
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
the
only
thing
that
i
would
say
is
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
provides
that
when
you
have
a
bill
of
lading
issued
in
this
country,
covering
cargo
being
shipped
out
that
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
must
be
inserted
in
that
clause.
now
of
course
there
are
some
others
like
the
pomerene
act
also
that
covers
the
issuance
of
the
bill
of
lading.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
let
me
put
it
this
way.
they
have
this
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
clause
section
3
subdivision
8
which
provides
that
if
a
carrier
attempts
to
insert
any
bill
of
lading,
any
clause
which
number
one,
relieves
enough
liability
or
attempts
to
lessen
its
liability,
then
that
clause
is
null
and
void.
and
that's
also
becomes
important
in
this
case
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
no
sir,
because
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
voluntary
act
to
the
party
because
i
don't
think
a
bill
of
lading
can
be
termed
in
the
same
classification
as
the
ordinary
contract.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
not
declared
against
public
policy,
there
could
--
i
think
sir,
it
comes
now
to
the
point
that
you
have
to
recognize
the
fact
that
a
shipper
is
in
a
no
bargaining
position.
i
mean
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
there
is
no
issue
here
sir,
perhaps
he
has
a
choice
of
carrier,
so
a
load
of
this
are
mentioned
in
this
case
(inaudible)
does
have
vessels
calling
at
the
ports
of
genoa.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
those
vessels
could
have
met
the
delivery
dates,
shows
somebody
a
different
consumer
of
the
cargo.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
certainly
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
sorry,
shipper
never
signs
a
bill
of
lading.
a
shipper
never
signs
a
bill
of
lading
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
the
steamship
carrier.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
it's
between
the
shipper
of
the
cargo
and
the
ship
owner.
but
the
shipper
of
the
cargo
never
signs
this
contract
nor
does
anybody
else
on
its
behalf.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir,
i
don't
say
that.
what
i
say
sir
when
you
would
consider
the
covenants
in
the
bill
of
lading,
you
must
consider
whether
or
not
they
are
permitted
by
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
or
are
they
prohibited
by
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
and
i
also
--
and
i
also
say
such,
when
--
when
you
have
an
exception
which
is
put
in
the
--
in
the
bill
of
lading
for
the
carrier's
own
benefit,
the
execution
of
that
bill
of
lading
must
be
looked
to.
i
mean
you
must
look
to
the
manner
which
the
bill
of
lading
is
executed.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir,
the
unilateral.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
i
don't
say
that
word
for
lack
of
ideology
sir.
i
say
you
have
to
certain
terms
of
conditions
in
the
bill
of
lading.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
i
don't
say
it's
bilateral.
i
say
it's
unilateral.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
if
they
don't
file
it,
they'll
violate
any
terms
and
conditions
of
the
public
policy
or
any
existing
rules
of
law
and
they
are
accepted
by
the
shipper,
yes,
so
i
think
they're
enforceable.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir,
i
say
it's
an
unreasonable
exception
also.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
it
violates,
i
say
--
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
mean
based
like
on
unreasonable
contract?
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
as
long
as
it
doesn't
violate
existing
laws
and
public
policy,
i
guess
so.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
say
so
that
this
clause
is
invalid.
one,
because
it
violates
public
policy,
two
because
it's
unreasonable
because
the
contract
itself
was
not
made
at
arm's
length
and
three,
it's
a
violation
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes
sir
because
there
is
no
--
no
--
no
place
here
that
the
shipper
signed
the
contract
or
anybody
else.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
because
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
says
well
that
a
bill
of
lading
must
be
issued.
when
a
cargo
is
loaded
on
board
a
vessel
and
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
bill
of
lading
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
it
doesn't
say
what
must
be
out
sir,
except
on
this
one
clause
section
3
subdivision
8
which
prohibits
the
insertion
of
a
clause
which
--
by
which
the
carrier
attempts
to
relieve
itself
from
liability
or
less
than
its
liability.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
it
goes
to
the
so
called
unreasonable
set
of
contracts
sir,
the
way
it's
negotiated,
the
way
the
bill
of
lading
--
how
the
bill
of
lading
is
issued.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
still
say
sir
that
this
cause
is
against
public
policy.
maybe
it
might
go
to
tend
to
defeat
my
arguments
sir
but
i
certainly
still
with
the
court
itself,
it
could
be
against
public
policy.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
it
could
very
well
be
sir
because
many
times
the
shippers
never
see
a
bill
of
lading
before
it's
actually
executed.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
one
way
or
the
other
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
in
this
instance
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
because
the
parties
agreed
on
the
freight
charge.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
did
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
sir
i
didn't
say
there
was
no
mutuality
of
agreement.
i
say
when
you
get
down
and
consider
this
exception
in
the
bill
of
lading,
you
must
consider
how
the
bill
of
lading
itself
was
issued.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
didn't
say
there
was
no
contract
against
the
different
parties.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes
sir.
i
say
it's
a
contract
but
it's
not
the
usual
--
it's
not
the
contract
in
the
usual
sense
when
two
parties
sit
down
and
negotiate
the
terms
of
conditions
of
the
contract.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well,
it's
something
along
that
line
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
i
know
that's
as
far
as
i
want
to
go.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
say
sir
they're
not
bound
by
unreasonable
exceptions
placed
in
there.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
well
for
some
other
reason.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
of
jurisdiction
sir,
yes
sir,
that's
my
position.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
sir
i
don't
think
--
we
had
that
yesterday
sir.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it's
in
the
holdings
of
our
courts
where
you
have
an
arbitration
agreement.
the
court
says
that
an
arbitration
agreement
itself
does
not
answer
the
courts
of
jurisdiction.
what
it
does
is,
an
arbitration
agreement,
two
parties
get
together
and
they
have
agreed
that
they're
going
to
--
they
are
going
to
settle
their
dispute
very
quickly
and
in
an
economic
fashion.
but
the
courts
do
retain
jurisdiction
over
--
over
the
arbitration
because
i
can
come
back
if
i
lose
in
an
arbitration,
i
can
come
back
into
court
and
i
can
offset
that
arbitration
agreement
if
--
if
--
let's
say
--
if
the
arbitrators
have
been
prejudiced
or
biased
or
some
of
the
other
various
grounds
set
forth
in
arbitration
to
laws.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
so
i
say
that
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
so
i
say
the
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right.
it
is
constitutional
sir
but
i
also
say
that
the
court
has
said
that
the
agreements
to
arbitrate
are
not
--
not
placed
in
the
same
category
as
agreements
which
oust
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
in
town.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
only
recall
a
case
here
you're
referring
to
your
honor.
i
was
not
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
but
as
if
it's
just
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
don't
recall
sir.
i
don't
recall
that
case.
it's
not
in
my
brief.
i
don't
recall
it.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes.
i
know
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
this
has
congress
authorized
the
parties
to
litigate
abroad.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
don't
have
to
face
that.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
i
say
so,
the
parties
--
an
agreement
whereby
parties
stipulate
not
to
litigate
any
of
their
claims
and
sold
just
like
that
has
been
held
void.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
all
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
an
arbitration
statute
sir?
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes,
it
passed
an
arbitration
statute.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
what
i
say
sir.
you
cannot
have
a
contract
which
completely
ousts
the
courts
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i'll
go
into
that
now
sir.
one
of
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
petitioners
which
says
that
the
--
this
clause
27
is
valid,
is
that
congress
and
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
did
not
state
any
particular
form
of
forms
in
which
an
agreed
cargo
owner
could
insert
--
could
litigate
its
claim.
now
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
contains
a
clause,
section
3
subdivision
8,
which
reads,
“any
clause
covenant
or
agreement
in
a
contract
of
carriage
where
leaving
the
carrier
or
the
ship
from
liability
or
loss
or
damage
to
or
in
connection
with
the
goods
arising
from
the
negligence
fault
or
failing
of
duties
and
obligations
provided
in
this
section
or
lessening
such
liability
otherwise
then
is
provided
in
this
act
shall
be
null
and
void
and
of
no
effect.”
now
i
say
that
that
clause
states
in
substance
that
the
carrier
has
only
those
benefits
which
are
provided
for
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
that
holding
was
set
forth
in
the
united
states
against
(inaudible)
sugar
company
which
is
affirmed
by
this
court.
but
i
am
referring
to
the
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
i
say
this
clause,
clause
27
which
gives
a
carrier
an
additional
benefit
not
provided
for
in
the
carriage
goods
by
sea
act
is
null
and
void
and
of
no
effect
as
so
provided
by
section
3,
subdivision
8.
now
while
i
am
on
a
point,
i
would
like
to
go
--
i
like
to
tell
the
court
this.
i
don't
think
that
congress
could
really
set
forth
a
sufficient
number
of
forms
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
to
provide
for
all
possible
litigation
under
this
act.
now
there
are
a
number
of
what
we
call
one-ship
operators.
that
is
a
ship
owner
which
is
incorporated
to
operate
one
ship
only.
now
they
are
both
united
states
and
they
are
foreign.
so
if
you
have
this
one
ship,
call
it
the
port
of
houston
as
to
this
case
and
pick
up
the
cargo
and
carry
it
to
genoa
50
and
a
cargo
was
discharged
in
a
damaged
condition
because
of
the
negligence
of
the
carrier,
and
if
there
would
--
should
be
certain
provisions
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
which
would
say
that
litigation
could
only
be
brought
in
a
form
or
a
jurisdiction
where
the
ship
or
the
consignee
has
it's
place
of
business
or
the
ship
owner
has
its
place
of
business,
or
the
place
in
which
the
cargo
was
shipped
or
delivered.
and
the
ship
returns
to
the
united
states
and
is
calling
up
one
port
only
and
that
should
be
the
port
of
san
francisco,
then
we
would
be
prohibited
by
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
starting
an
action
in
san
francisco.
that
is
a
universal
rule
of
--
in
admiralty
law
that
a
lifebelt
who
has
a
maritime
lead
against
the
vessel
has
the
right
to
sue
the
vessel
in
a
jurisdiction
where
the
vessel
can
be
found.
i
quote
--
i
stole
that
language
from
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
it's
called
--
it's
the
(inaudible)
case.
so
i
say
that
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act,
not
having
provided
for
any
special
form
or
not
having
given
any
particular
court
jurisdiction
over
any
particular
claim
does
not
disturb
that
universal
rule
in
admiralty
law
and
gives
us
the
right
to
start
and
--
and
act
in
any
jurisdiction
where
the
vessel
can
be
found
and
then
we
get
back
to
section
3,
subdivision
8
and
i
say
that
the
clause
herein
is
limiting
our
forms
especially
as
far
as
in
rem
causes
of
action
is
concerned
and
is
invalid.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
cannot
agree
to
that
sir
because
there
is
absolutely
nothing
and
approved
that
the
--
at
time,
courts
would
apply
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
although
i
will
admit
that
the
bill
of
lading
here
incorporates
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
there
is
no
guarantee
that
we
would
--
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
but
we
have
no
guarantee
that
the
courts
in
italy
would
so
enforce
the
carriage
goods
by
sea
act.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
think
they
have.
there
was
some
question
whether
or
not
they
were
going
to,
so
i'm
not
quite
positive
on
that
one
myself.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
don't
make
that
assumption
sir.
that
that
was
not
the
question
presented
to
me.
i
have
no
guarantee
that
that
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
i
know
sir
that
they
were
not
assured
of
the
same
limitations
in
italy
as
we
would
be
in
this
country
if
there
were
laws
and
if
it
were
applied.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
i
don't
have
to
assume
that
there
will
be
anything.
well
i'm
on
a
public
policy
question.
the
petitioners
make
the
further
argument
in
this
case
and
that
clause
27
should
be
enforced
because
it
would
have
to
be
so
that
american
ship
owners
--
shippers
of
cargo
will
in
the
future
use
american
ships
solely.
i
think
that
argument
is
very
unique
because
here
we
have
an
italian
ship
owner
pleading
before
the
united
supreme
court
that
this
clause
should
be
enforced
--
enforced
with
that
sole
purpose
only.
with
the
only
result
could
mean
that
the
italian
ship
owner
would
suffer
a
severe
economic
loss
because
it
ships
and
they
have
ten
of
them
would
be
returning
from
the
united
states
to
italy
with
empty
hauls.
i
also
say
that
the
court
cannot
say
that
american
ships,
shippers
of
cargo
should
use
american
ships
only,
because
as
i
think
judge
whittaker
raised
a
question
yesterday,
“what
would
happen
if
american
ships
were
not
available
to
call
at
foreign
ports
within
a
certain
specified
period.
what
would
happen
if
the
american
ships
do
not
port
at
certain
ports
at
all?
i
don't
think
that
this
court
would
place
american
manufacturers
or
shippers
of
cargo
in
a
position
where
they
could
be
sued
upon
contracts
for
breaches
of
contracts
and
failing
to
make
late
deliveries
or
suffer
an
economic
loss
because
we
don't
have
american
ships
falling
at
certain
ports.
i
say,
if
an
italian
ship
owner
or
a
foreign
ship
owner
is
doing
businesses
in
our
country
and
is
soliciting
our
trade,
the
least
it
might
be
bound
is
by
the
rules
of
our
courts
and
they
should
submit
themselves
to
the
jurisdictions
of
our
courts
of
courts.
they
should
not
be
granted
any
special
immunity
whereby
they
could
escape
the
practices
of
our
court
or
for
litigating
in
our
court.
they
should
not
be
given
a
special
privilege
whereby
they
can
deprive
an
american
citizen
of
a
substantial
right
of
selecting
the
form
in
which
to
litigate
his
action.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
the
ship
owner?
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
think
it's
against
our
public
policy,
yes
sir,
it
would.
i
think
it's
just
as
invalid
as
a
clause
which
would
say
that
if
american
ship
owner
is
saying
the
clause
if
we
can
only
--
we
can
only
litigate
in
a
city
where
he
has
his
own
place
of
business
is
made
at
a
place
of
business
like
new
york
city
only.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
this?
this
clause
sir
is
invalid,
as
against
public
policy
because
of
the
outside
force
of
jurisdiction,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
the
american
citizen.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
i
think
so
we
have
our
court's
to
protect
the
rights
of
american
citizens.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
would
like
to
read
you
the
clause
itself
sir.
it
says
also
that
no
legal
proceedings
may
be
brought
against
the
captain
or
ship
owners
or
their
agents.
in
respect
to
any
laws
of
or
damage
to
any
coherence
specified
except
in
genoa.
it
being
understood
and
agreed
that
every
other
tribunal
in
a
place
or
places
where
the
goods
were
shipped
or
landed
is
incompetent.
i
understand
by
that
sir
that
this
clause
or
the
italian
ship
owner
says
that
the
district
court
in
houston,
texas
where
the
cargo
was
loaded
is
without
jurisdiction.
because
by
definition,
a
competent
court
means
one
which
has
lawful
jurisdiction
and
an
incompetent
court
means
one
can
only
mean
that
one
is
without
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
if
this
was
the
contract
so
made
between
the
shipping
or
the
shipper
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes,
would
i
say
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i'd
say
no
sir.
that
clause
is
--
that
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
ousting
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
entirely.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
sir
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
sir
i
can
start
--
i
can
start
my
action
in
your
situation
sir
in
the
courts
of
new
york.
and
i
admit
that
the
carrier
can
come
in
and
state
my
proceeding
state
it
sir,
not
dismiss
it
just
state
it
and
send
me
to
arbitration.
and
then
if
i
win,
i
can
come
back
to
my
court
and
enter
it
and
i
get
a
full
judgment.
i
don't
think
that
the
courts
have
surrendered
the
entire
ligation.
i
have
not
complete
ousting
the
courts
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
insurance
company
against
morse.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
insurance
company
against
morse
decided
by
this
court
in
1874,
it's
going
in
my
brain.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
i
don't
know
sir.
this
court
in
insurance
company
versus
morse
adopted
the
language
and
started
against
avery
which
says
that
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
general
principles
that
parties
cannot
fight
time
to
oust
the
ordinary
courts
of
their
jurisdiction.
that
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well,
so
all
i
made
my
point
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
also
a
quarter
of
my
brief
says
that
the
fact
that
you
have
the
public
policy
is
the
important
thing.
you
already
have
that.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
when
you
start
from
the
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
oh
it's
been
held
down
through
the
year's
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
sir
i
refer
to
it
--
it's
been
an
accepted
rule
of
law
in
the
courts
of
our
country.
it's
been
accepted
not
only
by
this
court
but
it's
been
accepted
in
20
states,
separate
state
jurisdictions
which
are
also
referred
to
in
my
brief.
and
to
unanimous
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
so
all
i
can
argue
with
you
is
what
the
accepted
rule
of
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
can't
argue
with
you
sir,
accept
--
it
refer
to
what
is
the
unanimous
rule
in
this
country
and
throughout.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
what
i
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
said
that
sir
several
times
in
this
--
in
this
point
that
the
shipper
is
not
dealing
at
arm's
length.
now,
if
i
may
quote
you
from
--
from
united
states
sugar
against
bar
company
and
a
holding
in
that
court
which
was
affirmed
in
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
am
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
sir,
as
an
accepted
rule,
a
principle
that
shippers
of
cargo
do
not
deal
at
arm's
length
with
carriers.
and
may
i
quote
sir
from
this
case,
as
found
on
page
25
in
a
footnote
and
it
says,
“obviously
the
individual
shipper
has
no
opportunity
to
repudiate
the
document
agreed
upon
by
the
trade
even
if
he
has
actually
examined
it
at
all
of
its
28
lengthy
paragraphs
of
which
this
clause
is
number
nine.
this
lack
of
equality
of
bargaining
power
has
long
been
recognized
in
our
law.
and
the
stipulations
for
unreasonable
exception
of
the
carrier
have
not
been
allowed
to
stand.”
i
think
it's
a
well
recognized
rule
accepted
by
our
courts
that
shippers
of
cargo
do
not
have
equal
bargaining
power
with
ship
owners.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
the
only
thing
sir
is
no,
i
do
not.
i
only
know
that
an
american
ship
owners
not
--
do
not
insert
such
a
clause.
probably
based
on
a
foundation
that
such
clauses
are
against
our
public
policy
and
contrary
to
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
sir,
i'd
say
it's
a
great
bearing
because
there
will
be
no
reciprocity.
and
i
say
why
send
an
american
citizen
to
italy
if
italy
wouldn't
send
an
italian
citizen
to
america?
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
that's
what
i
cited
my
brief
sir.
so
i'd
like
to
deal
if
i
may,
i
think
we've
covered
the
public
policy
and
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
substantial
right
of
american
citizens
to
sue
on
this
court.
i
referred
this
court
to
the
case
of
ford
against
the
grand
trunk
railway
company.
now
i
admit
that
that
case
involved
a
federal
employer's
liability
act
and
that
that
act
provided
that
an
injured
employee
may
sue
in
a
place
where
he
resides,
the
place
where
the
court
of
action
arose
or
in
any
place
where
the
defendant
carrier
was
doing
business.
the
defendants
in
the
--
i'm
sorry.
the
railroad
employee
was
injured,
and
the
railroad
company
made
certain
payments
for
--
necessary
to
the
employee.
when
these
payments
were
made,
the
railroad
company
had
the
employee
sign
a
receipt
which
stipulated
that
in
the
event
that
the
employee's
case
could
not
be
settled
and
it
was
forced
to
go
to
litigation.
that
he
would
bring
in
--
his
action
in
one,
the
place,
the
jurisdiction
where
he
resided
or
two,
the
place
where
the
course
of
action
arose
that
is
where
he
was
injured.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
floyd
case
sir.
it's
found
on
page
21
of
my
brief.
the
railroad
employee
sues,
and
instead
of
suing
in
the
two
places
specified
in
the
agreement,
he
sued
in
that
very
jurisdiction.
the
railroad
company
thereupon
moved
to
dismiss
the
action.
and
this
court,
the
case
found
its
way
up
to
this
court
and
this
court
says
that
the
agreement
to
the
railroad
company
and
the
employee
violated
section
5
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
in
that,
by
the
agreement
the
railroad
companies
sought
to
exempt
themselves
from
liability.
i
say
in
this
case,
clause
27
should
be
raised
with
section
1303
(a)
or
section
3
subdivision
(a)
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
we
must
come
to
the
same
inevitable
conclusion.
now
the
ruling
in
the
floyd
case,
i
say
was
enlarged
by
the
ruling
in
wilko
against
swan
which
involved
an
interpretation
of
the
securities
act.
in
that
case,
a
broker
and
a
customer
was
doing
business.
the
cause
of
false
representation
by
the
broker,
the
customer
ports
certain
stocks
which
instead
of
going
up,
went
down
and
he
sued
the
broker
to
recover
for
his
loss.
there
was
an
agreement
between
the
broker
and
--
and
the
--
and
the
customer
which
provided
that
there
was
any
disputes
between
the
two,
the
agreements
would
be
arbitrated.
now
in
the
course
of
its
discussion,
this
court
said
that
citizens
have
a
substantial
right
in
which
to
select
the
form
in
which
they
are
to
litigate
these
claims.
it
also
said
that
any
agreement
made
in
the
advance
of
controversy,
which
is
the
agreement
here.
is
good
or
a
different
footing
from
those
made
in
agreements
made
after
the
controversy
has
arisen
and
it
infer
and
i
think
it
really
helped
that
agreements
made
in
the
advance
of
controversy
which
seek
to
oust
the
courts
of
jurisdiction
are
invalid.
the
petitioners
in
trying
to
enforce
this
clause
as
being
reasonable
rely
on
three
cases,
commonly
referred
to
as
the
muller
case,
the
kearsarge
case
and
a
(inaudible)
case,
all
of
which
were
decided
in
the
second
circuit.
i
call
the
court's
attentions
to
this
fact,
that
in
those
three
cases,
it
is
recognized
that
the
courts,
by
contract
cannot
oust
that
the
parties,
i'm
sorry,
by
contract
cannot
oust
the
courts
of
jurisdiction.
what
those
cases
--
or
the
courts
did
on
those
cases
was
to
consider
the
facts
and
each
one
of
those
cases.
and
then
find
out
whether
or
not
the
form
selected
by
the
libeler
was
convenient
for
the
file
of
issues.
now
in
the
oklahoma
or
the
muller
case,
the
cargo
was
loaded
on
board
the
oklahoma
at
dockenberg
(inaudible)
suite.
during
the
voyage
from
the
united
states
--
from
sweden
to
the
united
states,
the
oklahoma
sunk.
it
never
reached
the
united
states.
one
crew
members
was
saved
or
returned
to
sweden.
in
the
kearsarge
case,
the
cargo
was
loaded
on
board
the
vessel
in
peru
and
the
cargo
was
discharged
at
european
courts.
that
vessel
on
that
voyage
never
called
at
any
port
in
the
united
states.
no
part
of
the
contract
of
carriage
was
performed
in
the
united
states,
so
too
in
the
(inaudible)
the
cargo
in
that
case
was
loaded
on
board
the
vessel
and
headed
for
belgium
and
discharged
at
the
(inaudible)
no
part
of
the
contract
of
carriage
was
performed
in
the
united
states
the
vessel
did
not
call
on
the
united
states
either.
so
on
every
single
major
issue
in
all
three
cases
that
is,
the
condition
of
the
cargo,
the
storage
of
the
cargo,
the
seaworthiness
of
the
vessel,
the
issuance
of
the
bill
of
lading
and
the
loss
while
all
--
all
of
the
testimony
on
all
issues
was
available
in
foreign
courts
only.
in
this
case,
i
repeat,
the
cargo
originated
in
the
united
states.
it
was
delivered
to
the
ocean
carrier
in
the
united
states.
it
was
loaded
on
board
the
vessel
in
the
united
states.
the
voyage
commenced
in
the
united
states
and
the
bills
of
lading
were
issued
in
the
united
states.
thus,
on
all
important
issues,
testimony
is
available
right
here
in
the
united
states.
now
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
this
question
of
the
origin
--
where
the
voyage
originates.
all
of
the
case
law
is
that
the
vessel
must
be
in
a
seaworthy
condition
where
the
cargo
was
taken
on
board
the
vessel.
in
this
case,
the
vessel
must
have
been
seaworthy
on
loading
of
the
cargo
at
houston
and
new
orleans,
not
in
genoa
of
italy.
now,
i
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
fact.
the
bill
of
lading
is
printed
in
english.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
said,
that
that
was
indication
on
a
part
of
the
parties
that
i
dispute
arising
under
the
bill
of
lading
would
be
decided
by
an
english
court.
the
bill
of
lading
also
incorporates
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
and
this
court
has
held
in
the
gulf
case,
which
is
referred
on
--
on
page
32
and
33
of
my
brief,
that
there
is
an
appropriateness
to,
in
having
the
trial
of
a
diversity
case
and
a
form
that
is
at
(inaudible)
with
the
state
law
that
must
govern
the
case
rather
than
having
a
court
in
some
other
form
untangle
problems
and
conflicts
of
law
and
in
law
foreign
to
itself.
thus
i
say,
this
court
has
recognized
the
fact
that
where
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
or
some
other
american
law
is
involved
and
if
there
are
sufficient
reasons
to
keep
the
case
in
the
united
states
that
that
case
should
be
kept
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
like
to
deal
with
my
course
of
action
in
rem.
it
is
conceded
in
this
case
that
we
have
two
courses
of
action.
one,
in
personam
and
that
is
against
the
ocean
carrier.
and
the
second
one,
in
rem,
that
is
against
the
carrying
vessel.
law
27
states
that
no
legal
proceedings
against
the
captain
or
ship
owner
or
their
agents
may
be
brought
in
any
jurisdiction
other
than
the
courts
in
general
already.
it
does
not
speak
of
an
action
in
rem.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
it's
the
ship
owner's
agent
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well,
i
think
sir
you
can
--
i
don't
think
it's
to
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
ship
can
be
qualified
as
an
agent
for
the
ship
owner,
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well
i
think
--
i
didn't
think
of
it
your
honor.
except
that
i
think
that
the
word
agents
qualifies
captain
or
ship
owners
only.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir.
i
think
that
--
i
don't
think
so
sir.
i
think
the
human
admiralty
--
we
recognize
the
fact
that
the
--
the
vessel
was
just
as
liable
as
a
--
as
the
owner.
in
other
words
i
can
go
directly
against
the
--
directly
against
the
ship
as
a
person.
i
tried
to
--
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
as
an
individual,
it's
a
really
--
it
comes
out
to
as
a
separate
individual.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no
sir
i
do
not.
i
say
if
--
i
say
if
we
have
an
action
in
rem
against
--
and
in
personam,
i
say
if
this
should
be
there
would
be
a
judgment
against
one
or
apply
against
both.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
now
--
i
think
you've
asked
me
that
one
question
you've
taken
about
five
minutes
of
my
time.
i
mean
when
i
was
going
to
speak.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
no,
no,
i
mean
i'm
thankful
for
it.
the
petitioners
say
at
least
in
their
brief
--
the
argument
is
not
made
and
they
reply
to
it.
that
in
the
muller,
the
kearsarge
and
the
(inaudible)
cases,
the
courts
in
the
second
circuit
did
not
make
a
dis
--
did
not
distinguish
between
in
personam
and
in
rem
actions.
i
think
my
statement
of
the
facts
in
those
cases
really
answers
the
problem.
that
this
vital
point
was
not
before
the
courts
in
those
cases
for
the
simple
reason,
in
the
muller
case,
the
carrying
vessel,
the
ss
oklahoma
sunk.
in
the
kearsarge
case,
the
kearsarge
was
not
named
as
a
respondent,
and
if
it
was
named
a
respondent,
jurisdiction
was
never
obtained
over
the
vessel.
and
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
i
will
admit
that
the
(inaudible)
was
named
as
a
respondent.
but
jurisdiction
was
never
obtained
over
the
vessel.
in
other
words,
process
was
never
issued
against
them.
it
was
really
not
a
respondent.
just
naming
a
vessel
as
a
respondent
in
a
libel
does
not
necessarily
give
the
court
jurisdiction
over
the
vessel.
the
carrier,
the
petitioners
also
refer
to
three
cases
which
they
substantiate
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
divorce
an
in
rem
action
from
an
in
personam
action.
those
cases
are
the
smith,
the
bennett,
and
the
samuels
cases.
and
each
of
those
three
cases,
the
court
found
that
a
longshoreman
employed
by
a
ship
owner
and
loading
or
unloading
the
ship
owner's
vessel
was
injured.
the
longshoreman's
right
against
the
ship
owner
or
his
employer
are
governed
by
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
worker's
act.
that
act
provides
that
the
longshoreman
can
recover
in
certain
instances
and
sort
of
regulates
the
amount.
the
longshoreman
was
not
satisfied
with
this
procedure
and
went
against
the
vessel.
the
courts
of
appeal
i
think
for
the
second
and
third
and
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“that
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
longshoreman
on
the
harbor
worker's
act
intended
that
they
ensure
--
longshoreman's
right
should
be
exclusively
adjudicated
by
the
provisions
of
that
act.
the
holding
in
those
cases
is
clearly
expressed
in
a
case
of
central
railroad
company
of
new
jersey
against
burns
brothers
which
is
referred
to
on
page
43
of
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
stated
that
smith
against
(inaudible)
mcdowell
and
samuels
against
monsoon
steamship
company
on
which
the
central
railroad
relies
are
irrelevant.
they
decided
no
more
than
that
in
a
longshoremans
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act,
congress
meant
to
make
exclusive
the
liabilities
that
it
(inaudible)
opposed.
and
that
same
proposition
can
be
applied
to
the
consumers
products
case
or
imports
case
which
is
referred
to
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
--
i
think
it's
in
this
last
point.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
i
say
no
sir.
i'd
say
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
say,
i'd
like
to
go
--
i'll
attack
his
points
one
by
one.
he
says
that
the
more
convenient
to
try
the
issue
here
or
reasonable
to
try
the
issue
here
because
one,
the
s
--
monrosa
--
the
genoa
vessel,
the
crew
members
are
residents
of
italy
the
third
one
is
that
the
seaworthiness
of
the
vessel
becomes
important
because
a
lot
of
testimonies
in
italy
in
general
average
has
been
declared
the
cargo
was
discharged
to
the
port
of
genoa.
the
market
value
is
available.
the
testimony
in
genoa
and
the
seventh
argument
is
that
american
shippers
of
cargo
should
use
american
ships.
now
i
say,
the
fact
that
the
vessel
is
genoese
has
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
merits
of
this
case
and
can
be
excluded.
the
fact
that
the
crew
members
and
the
offices
are
residents
of
italian
--
of
italy
is
very
important
in
this
case
because
when
this
action
was
commenced,
we
thought
the
responded,
carbon
black
export
inc.
sought
to
take
the
testimony
of
those
witnesses
in
houston,
texas
at
the
same
time
the
vessel
was
on
port.
now
the
vessel
has
also
returned
to
the
united
states
on
a
number
of
occasions
but
the
respondent,
the
petitioners
here
never
sought
to
take
their
testimony.
thus,
all
of
those
issues,
all
of
those
issues
could
have
been
resolved
if
they
had
submitted
the
crew
members
and
--
and
the
offices
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
texas
because
we
could
have
taken
their
testimony
and
we
were
willing
to
pay
for
all
those
expenses.
so
i
say
on
that
point,
we
can
discount
that
point
because
that
really
shows
the
unreasonable
attitude
of
the
petitioners
where
we
expect
that
the
seaworthiness
of
a
vessel,
i
say
that
most
of
that
testimony
is
available
here
in
houston
and
--
and
new
orleans.
because
in
a
number
of
five
polls
together
with
the
carbon
black,
there
was
stone,
a
number
of
iron
clumps
of
chemicals.
the
iron
drums
broke
loose,
crashed
against
the
plates
of
the
vessel
and
one
of
the
plates
being
wasted,
cracked
and
allowed
to
the
entry
of
sea
water
into
the
hole.
so
the
storage
of
the
cargo
becomes
very
important
and
that's
only
available
at
the
ports
of
houston
and
texas.
the
market
value
and
the
amount
of
cargo
damage
can
practically
be
stipulated.
and
the
fact
that
a
general
average
has
been
declared
has
no
bearing
on
this
case
because
if
the
loss
in
fact
was
occurred
because
the
vessel
was
un-seaworthy
on
leaving
the
ports
of
houston
and
texas
and
the
general
average
resulted
there
from,
the
general
average
is
invalid.
so
i
say
as
against
that,
we
have
all
of
the
testimony
on
condition
of
cargo,
storage
of
cargo,
seaworthiness
of
vessel
and
the
commencement
of
the
voyage,
the
issuance
of
the
bill
of
lading
and
other
--
all
other
important
issues
available
right
here
in
the
united
states.
so
i
say
there
is
a
great
convenience
but
a
trial
of
this
action
here
in
the
united
states
and
not
general
rhythm.
mr.
joseph
t.
mcgowan
well,
they
said
if
there
was
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
went
to
every
single
fact
involved
in
this
case.
it
wrote
a
seven
or
eight
page
decision
and
it
analyzed
all
the
facts.
the
district
court,
all
it
said
was
the
clause
was
not
unreasonable
and
dismissed
my
libel.
it
didn't
even
discuss
my
action
in
rem.
i
think
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
of
course
it's
reviewable
--
it's
reviewable
and
appealable
since
my
libel
was
in
fact
dismissed.
i
say
in
conclusion
that
this
clause
should
be
held
invalid
because
is
it
against
--
it
is
against
public
policy.
i
also
say
that
my
in
rem
action
should
be
restored.
i
also
say
it
is
more
convenient
to
try
the
case
here
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
given.
there
is
not
one
single
reported
case
in
any
book
whereby
a
clause
similar
to
the
one
involved
in
this
litigation
has
been
declared
enforceable
or
whereby
any
court
has
review,
has
declined
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
action
where
the
cargo
originated
in
the
untied
states.
the
contract,
at
least
the
part
was
performed
in
the
united
states.
the
bills
of
lading
were
issued
in
the
united
states.
the
american
--
the
dockers
are
american
citizen
and
an
in
rem
cause
of
action
has
been
perfected.
thank
you.
