mr.
e.
d.
vickery
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
shipment
of
a
cargo
of
carbon
black
from
the
ports
of
new
orleans,
louisiana,
and
houston,
texas
to
four
different
ports
in
italy;
genoa,
naples,
venice,
and
trieste.
the
shipment
was
made
aboard
petitioner's
vessel,
the
monrosa.
petitioner
is
an
italian
steamship
company.
during
the
course
of
the
vessel's
voyage
to
italy
while
the
vessel
was
in
the
atlantic
ocean,
one
of
the
plates
in
one
of
the
cargo
holes
gave
way
and
permitted
seawater
to
enter
into
the
vessel's
hole.
as
a
consequence,
all
of
the
carbon
black
in
one
of
the
holes
of
the
vessel
was
damaged
by
the
seawater.
although
it
was
all
--
it
was
destined
for
four
separate
ports
in
italy.
the
force
--
the
first
port
of
call
was
genoa,
as
it
was
all
damaged,
it
was
all
discharged
at
genoa
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
substantial
delivery
in
the
other
three
italian
ports.
the
liable
was
instituted
against
the
vessel
in
rem
and
against
the
petitioner
in
personam
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
houston
praying
for
damages
somewhat
in
excess
of
$100,000
by
virtue
of
this
damage.
as
a
warrant
of
seizure
was
issued
for
the
vessel
and
the
vessel
placed
under
arrest
by
the
marshal,
petitioner
of
necessity
posted
the
necessary
corporate
surety
bond
to
secure
the
release
of
the
vessel
so
it
could
continue
in
its
normal
operations.
a
claim
of
the
owner
was
also
filed
at
this
time
as
it
is
usual
and
customary
and
admiralty,
and
maritime
matters.
because
the
contract
of
carriage,
the
bill
of
lading,
the
bills
of
lading
rather,
some
27
in
number
insofar
as
they
relate
to
this
particular
cause
of
action
had
a
cause
in
them
which
provided
that
no
legal
proceedings
for
the
recovery
of
loss
or
damage
to
this
cargo
should
be
instituted
except
in
the
courts
of
genoa,
italy.
for
this
reason,
the
petitioners
filed
a
motion
to
decline
jurisdiction.
in
filing
this
motion,
the
petitioners
did
not
contest
or
question
the
basic
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
houston.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
both
in
personam
and
in
rem
is
admitted.
there
is
no
question
with
respect
to
basic
jurisdiction.
however,
the
petitioner
requested
the
district
court
to
decline
to
hear
this
litigation
because
the
agreement
made
to
litigate
claims
in
genoa,
italy
was
not
and
an
unreasonable
one
and
that
in
fact,
the
only
reasonable
forum
for
the
adjudication
of
this
controversy
was
in
the
courts
of
italy,
the
agreed
upon
forum.
the
district
court
granted
this
motion
and
declined
jurisdiction,
upon
its
finding
that
the
agreement
was
not
an
unreasonable
one.
it
required
the
respondent
in
the
district
court
and
the
petitioners
here,
however,
to
give
appropriate
security
to
the
libelant
in
the
total
amount
of
the
initial
bond
of
$100,000
conditioned
that
the
petitioner
would
pay
any
judgment
that
might
be
awarded
by
the
italian
courts.
this
was
to
protect
the
security
which
the
respondent
was
able
to
obtain
upon
a
seizure
of
the
vessel
in
houston.
so,
insofar
as
a
security
for
its
loss,
if
it
is
able
to
establish
liability,
the
respondent
has
full
security
as
if
the
case
were
pending
in
the
united
states.
the
court,
in
granting
this
motion,
relied
on
a
decision
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
the
william
h.
muller
case
by
which
we
shall
talk
at
some
length
further
in
the
argument.
the
court,
however,
went
somewhat
further
then
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
require
in
the
muller
case
when
it
required
the
posting
of
a
corporate
surety
bond
to
protect
the
security
which
the
respondent
had
obtained
by
issuing
a
warrant
of
seizure
against
the
vessel.
when
the
matter
was
taken
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
that
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
primarily
on
two
grounds.
first
of
all,
that
the
agreement
to
adjudicate
claims
in
genoa,
italy
only
was
void
as
contrary
to
public
policy.
and
secondly,
on
the
grounds
that
the
agreement
in
the
contract
of
carriage,
the
bill
of
lading,
was
not
sufficient
to
cover
in
rem
actions
against
the
vessel
itself
as
well
as
in
personam
actions
against
the
owners
of
the
vessel.
so,
we
turned
first
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
agreement
such
as
this,
upon
a
particular
forum
for
the
litigation
of
any
controversies
that
might
arise
with
respect
to
a
particular
shipment
of
cargo,
aboard
a
foreign
vessel,
is
valid
and
enforceable
or
whether
it
is
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
held
contrary
to
the
public
policy.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
this
is
a
clause
that
is
contained
as
far
as
i
know
in
all
of
the
bills
of
lading
of
this
particular
foreign
ship
owner
and
i
think
a
similar
clause
is
very
universal
insofar
as
most
foreign
ship
owners
are
concerned.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
clauses,
so
far
as
i
know,
with
the
experiences
that
i
have
had,
the
american
steamship
companies
that
i
have
represented
have
not
had
such
clauses
in
them
whether
any
american
companies
do
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
they
are
not
recognized
such
agreements
or
not
recognized
in
italy
because
of
a
specific
enactment
of
the
italian
legislature
that
such
clauses
are
void.
of
course,
we
make
no
contention
here
that
had
congress
said
such
an
agreement
was
void
that
we
could
enforce
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
only
act
of
congress
that
relates
to
this
problem
is
the
united
states'
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
which
was
passed
in
1936.
it
--
it's
exactly
the
same
almost
word
for
word
for
the
so-called
brussels
convention
which
was
an
international
agreement
with
respect
to
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
almost
all
maritime
nations
have
now
ratified
that
--
that
particular
convention.
now,
insofar
as
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
matter
was
considered
by
congress
at
the
time
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
was
passed,
which
i
assume
that's
what
mr.
justice
black
is
getting
at.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
only
proposals
that
i
know
of
to
amend
the
acts
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
of
controversy
such
as
this
have
arisen
in
the
proceedings
before
the
maritime
law
association
of
the
united
states,
which
is
of
course
an
organization
of
admiralty
and
maritime
lawyers
and
in
the
application
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
which
we
filed,
we
put
excerpts
from
the
--
from
the
proceedings
before
the
maritime
law
association
and
in
those
a
specific
--
a
specific
wording
of
the
statute
was
suggested
in
a
majority
report
i
believe
by
mr.
longley,
the
amicus
curiae
and
the
court
permitted
to
file
a
brief
yesterday
in
this
particular
case.
he
suggested
that
the
maritime
law
association
sponsor
a
bill
in
congress
to
expressly
make
such
clauses
as
this
invalid
and
void.
and
at
the
meeting,
i
believe,
it
was
november
of
1957,
if
my
recollection
served
me
correctly,
the
maritime
law
association
voted
that
proposal
down
by
vote
of
70
to
30
or
something
as
i
recall
the
vote.
it
was
a
--
those
meetings
do
not
constitute
a
very
substantial
portion
of
the
membership
of
the
association
but
that
was
the
action
at
that
particular
time.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
congress
has
considered
such
clauses
as
this
and
whether
or
not
the
congress
has
given
us
any
expression
on
these
particular
clauses,
we
have
only
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
to
go
by
and
we
can
only
look
at
certain
portions
of
the
legislative
history
because
it
does
not
appear
that
these
jurisdictional
clauses
or
these
clauses
to
litigate
claims
in
a
particular
forum
were
specifically
considered
by
the
congress.
the
only
indication
we
have
that
congress
was
aware
of
agreement
such
as
this
is
contained
in
the
fact
that
they
were
very
conscious
about
following
the
brussels
convention.
they
were
very
conscious
of
being
uniformed
in
the
enactment
of
the
united
states
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
insofar
as
all
of
the
acts
in
other
maritime
countries
were
concerned.
they
were
also
aware
and
the
legislative
history
amply
reflects
this,
that
the
australian
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
the
canadian
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act,
both
contains
provisions
which
prohibited
such
agreements
as
this.
now
then,
canada
has
since
amended
its
act
and
has
taken
out
the
prohibition
which
eliminates
--
which
prohibited
agreements
such
as
this
and
its
act,
and
it
was
doing
that
at
approximately
the
same
time
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
was
considering
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
now,
with
respect
to
that,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
in
considering
the
muller
case,
expressly
states
that
had
congress
intended
for
agreement
such
as
this
to
be
invalid
and
they
intended
to
adopt
in
effect
the
minority
rule
of
canada
and
australia
rather
than
the
majority
rule
of
the
rest
of
the
maritime
nations
which
permitted
such
agreements
then
the
second
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
says
they
would
have
done
it
in
plain
and
unequivocal
language
that
they
wouldn't
have
left
it
to
implication.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
english
law
permits
them.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir,
on
two
separate
occasions.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
i
don't
recall
and
what
the
difference
was
but
the
senate
ratified
it
twice.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
this
was
--
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
was
considered
to
be
a
supplement
to
eliminate
any
questions
of
that
is
applying
to
any
and
all
shipments
out
of
the
united
states.
there
seem
to
be
some
question
with
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
not
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it's
my
--
it's
my
understanding
that
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
the
ones
that
i
have
seen
to
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
the
two
of
the
circuit
--
two
of
the
court
of
appeals'
cases
from
the
second
circuit
involved
swedish
and
norwegian
vessels
and
they
both
have
clauses
such
as
this.
it's
an
almost
--
i
think
i'm
safe
in
saying
it's
an
almost
universal
clause
insofar
as
foreign
vessels
are
concerned,
whether
it
is
a
sharp
blade
of
competition
and
the
unfavorable
bargaining
position
that
an
american
ship
owner
finds
himself
in
and
competing
for
the
international
market
which
causes
him
to
leave
in
that.
i
don't
know.
but
as
i
say,
the
ones
that
i
have
seen
in
american
bills
do
not
contain
agreements
such
as
this.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
of
course,
i'm
familiar
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
which
--
in
the
consumers
import
case
which
he
discusses
that
question
that
this
court
has
endorsed
that
rule
expressly
except
in
cases
where
an
american
citizen
is
involved
and
you
indicated
in
your
opinion
in
that
case
that
if
appropriate
security
is
given
and
in
personam
jurisdiction
in
the
foreign
country
is
permitted
that
in
fact,
i
guess
you
would
call
it
dictum
because
we're
not
necessarily
the
decision
in
the
case,
you
say
that
forum
non
conveniens
would
permit
a
transfer
under
those
circumstances.
so
i
think
that
without
any
question,
what
you
are
thinking
of
here
is
that
even
without
the
agreement,
the
court
under
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
if
it
had
considered
italy
to
be
the
more
convenient
forum
could
have
sustained
the
motion
of
the
petitioners
here
for
the
motion
was
made
in
the
alternative
on
the
basis
of
the
agreement
or
forum
non
conveniens
and
i
believe
this
court
has
both
questions
before
it
at
this
time.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i'm
frank
to
say
i
was
not
aware
that
they
didn't
have
that
clause
until
i
got
the
checking
into
it
in
connection
with
this
case,
the
dealing
with
bill
of
lading
involving
american
ship
owners
for
10
years
until
i
got
involved
in
this
case.
i
didn't
realize
they
even
have
such
a
clause.
what
the
reason
would
be,
i
don't
know
unless
it
is
a
fact
that
--
because
of
the
difference
in
the
cost
of
operations
particularly
with
respect
to
laborer
and
things
to
that
nature,
the
americans
were
in
an
unfavorable
bargaining
position.
that
may
be
the
answer
to
it.
i
just
don't
know.
now
then,
in
considering
the
question
of
public
policy
and
why
congress
might
not
have
thought
it
appropriate
to
include
such
a
specific
agreement
as
this,
i
have
already
mentioned
to
the
court
first
of
all
the
congress
is
concern
that
we
have
uniformity
among
the
maritime
nations
and
their
adoption
of
what
i
would
call
the
majority
rule
of
such
agreement
as
this
were
not
excluded
in
the
acts,
but
there
is
still
another.
there
is
still
another
reason
behind
congress'
action
in
this
regard
as
i
see
it
and
that
would
be
congress'
desire
to
encourage
american
shippers
to
ship
on
american
ships.
now,
if
american
shippers
are
interested
in
litigating
any
claims
they
might
have
for
loss
or
damage
to
their
cargo,
which
are
being
shipped
abroad,
they
in
effect
have
a
choice
by
shipping
on
american
ships
they
can
sue
in
american
courts.
if
they
want
to
ship
on
foreign
ships
and
the
foreigners
say,
“in
return
for
your
shipping
on
my
ship,
i
am
requiring
you
to
agree
to
litigate
your
claims
in
italy,”
then
they
ought
to
be
relegated
to
the
courts
of
italy.
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
--
about
what
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
a
choice
or
one
of
the
largest
american
steamship
companies
in
the
country
operate
vessels
out
of
these
same
ports,
to
the
ports
of
italy
each
two
weeks,
every
month
out
of
the
year.
so,
it's
not
a
question
of
the
respondent
having
to
take
this
or
not
having
any
choice.
it's
not
something
that's
forced
on
the
responded
against
his
will.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no.
i
--
i
am
certain
that
it
would
not
always
be
true,
but
the
shipper
is
adequately
protected
as
long
as
the
rule
obtains
that
the
agreement
is
valid
only
if
reasonable.
now
then,
if
it
reaches
the
point
where
a
shipper
in
effect
doesn't
have
a
choice,
and
is
forced
to
take
such
an
agreement,
then
the
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
sound
discretion
can
say
this
agreement
is
unreasonable
because
the
shipper
in
this
particular
case
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
ship
any
other
way.
you
force
this
down
his
throat
without
his
consent.
as
long
as
the
courts
require
that
the
agreement
be
reasonable,
it
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
the
question
of
reasonableness,
if
the
court
please,
it
turns
on
similar
questions
that
you
--
the
question
similar
to
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
what
if
it
is
a
reasonable
stipulation
and
if
it
is
a
convenient
forum
that
is
the
primary
test
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
agreement.
this
one
was
for
genoa,
one
of
the
courts
of
call
on
this
particular
vessel
where
part
of
the
cargo
was
destined
to
be
discharged.
now,
i
don't
think
that
any
district
court
would
hold
if
this
agreement
says
you
have
to
litigate
only
in
siberia,
that
any
court
would
hold
that
to
be
a
reasonable
agreement
or
even
london,
england.
it
might
not
be
a
reasonable
agreement.
that's
something
addressed
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
court.
and
in
determining
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
agreement,
the
court
looks
primarily
to
what
has
to
be
done
in
order
to
establish
the
libellant's
case
or
in
order
for
the
ship
owner
to
establish
its
defenses.
now
then,
to
look
at
the
reasonableness
of
this
agreement,
rather
quickly
and
rather
basically
and
to
get
it
in
the
very
sharp
contrast,
let's
imagine
if
you
will
that
we're
preparing
to
try
this
case
on
the
merits
for
the
cargo
damage.
there
are
only
two
real
issues
in
this
lawsuit.
first
of
all,
was
the
vessel
owner,
did
the
vessel
owner
used
due
diligence
to
make
the
vessel
seaworthy
before
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
voyage
as
required
by
the
united
states
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act?
and
secondly,
if
petitioners
did
not
use
that
diligence,
what
is
the
amount
of
damages
to
which
the
respondents
are
entitled
for
the
damage
to
this
cargo?
those
are
the
only
two
issues
in
this
case,
first
on
the
question
of
diligence
to
make
the
vessel
seaworthy
--
seaworthy
before
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
voyage.
let's
separate
that
into
two
parts.
first
of
all,
before
the
beginning
of
the
voyage,
where
is
the
evidence
going
to
come
from
to
establish
diligence
before
the
commencement
of
the
voyage?
it
can
come
only
from
italy.
where
does
it
come
from?
it
comes
from
members
of
the
vessel's
crew
to
reside
in
italy
and
sail
on
italian
ships.
secondly,
it
comes
from
petitioner's
shore-based
personnel
in
italy
who
are
responsible
for
periodic
surveys
and
periodic
inspections
of
the
vessel
in
italy.
thirdly,
it
comes
from
records
of
the
petitioners,
records
of
the
italian
ship
owner
that
are
available
only
in
italy.
fourthly,
it
comes
from
italian
surveyors
who
are
present
and
periodic,
annual
or
semiannual
inspections
of
the
vessel.
they
reside
and
are
available
only
in
italy.
fifth,
it
may
come
from
records
of
italian
shipyards
where
repairs
to
this
vessel
have
been
made
from
time
to
time.
and
sixth,
it
may
come
from
personnel
of
the
same
italian
shipyards.
not
a
single
order
of
evidence
on
this
diligence
of
the
ship
owner
to
make
this
vessel
seaworthiness
before
the
commencement
of
this
voyage
is
available
in
the
united
states.
it's
all
got
to
come
from
italy
on
--
sir?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
voyage
commenced
in
italy.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
--
the
voyage,
the
roundtrip
voyage
of
the
vessel
was
from
italy
to
the
united
states
and
return.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
so
far
as
the
shipper
is
concerned,
there
is
an
appreciable
conflict
as
to
where
the
voyage
began.
i'm
willing
to
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
agreement
as
counsel
or
respondent
contends,
that
the
beginning
of
this
voyage
as
to
them
was
houston
and
new
orleans
where
the
cargo
was
loaded.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it
--
it
has
some
bearing
and
i
wasn't
going
to
overlook
that.
i
just
hadn't
gotten
to
it
yet.
our
obligation
is
twofold
on
diligence
before
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
voyage.
that
is
the
statutory
language.
it's
not
--
it's
not
--
that
counts
to
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
these
points
i've
been
talking
about
here
is
before
the
beginning
of
the
voyage
which
would
be
while
the
vessel
was
in
italy.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
i
think
this
case,
except
for
--
this
case
is
probably
a
reasonably
good
example
of
about
how
long
it
would
take.
there
was
some
delay.
there
was
some
delay
in
my
office
for
which
i'm
personally
responsible
of
about
six
months
immediately
after
the
institution
of
this
litigation.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
this
damage
occurred
in
january
of
1956.
it
was
loaded
in
december
of
1955
and
the
vessel
got
to
italy
in
january
of
1956.
so
it
was
instituted
in
april
of
1956
upon
the
return
of
the
monrosa
to
the
port
of
houston,
and
there
was
some
delay
as
i
say
for
about
six
months
in
my
office,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
in
this
particular
case,
he
has
a
suit
pending
now
in
italy
while
the
district
court
was
considering
the
question.
the
one
year
limitation
period
was
about
to
elapse
and
the
respondent
requested
us
to
give
him
an
extension
of
time
in
which
to
sue
in
italy
and
it
was
readily
granted.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
as
i
understand,
it
is
just
simply
hasn't
reached
on
the
docket
over
there.
our
correspondents
in
italy
tell
us
that
it
is
simply
it's
not
been
reached
and
it's
my
understanding
that
the
respondents
are
not
interested
in
pressing
that
until
they
see
the
end
result
here.
they
obviously
would
much
prefer
to
have
it
in
this
country
and
they're
not
pressing
it
and
obviously,
send
its
money
out
of
the
italian
ship
owner's
pocket,
if
he
loses
the
case
he's
not
too
anxious
to
get
it
decided
either.
so
it's
just
pending
in
italy.
we
gave
an
extension
of
time
after
the
district
court's
decision
in
the
case.
however,
we
decline
to
give
any
further
extension
and
told
them
that
we
thought
it
appropriate
with
the
decision
declining
jurisdiction
that
they
institute
a
necessary
suit.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
bears
on
the
enforceability
of
it
rather
than
the
legal
aspects
of
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
i
don't
know
why
the
fifth
circuit
considered
the
in
rem
question
once
they
declare
the
agreement
to
be
void.
they
give
--
they
gave
the
italian
ship
owner
in
personam
jurisdiction
when
they
do
that
and
the
decision
with
respect
to
the
in
rem
aspect
of
it
was
wholly
unnecessary
to
give
the
respondent
the
jurisdiction
which
they
were
asking
for.
it
was
not
necessary.
once
that
--
if
this
agreement
is
void,
well
then
of
course,
they're
perfectly
free
to
proceed.
in
houston,
they
have
in
personam
jurisdiction
there.
there
isn't
any
question
about
it.
they
could
get
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
the
same
shipper
today
if
they
wanted.
i
mean
the
same
steamship
company.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
they
have
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir,
yes,
sir.
there
are
both
in
rem
and
in
personam
jurisdictions
in
houston.
there
is
no
question
at
all
about
that,
not
at
all.
now,
may
--
mr.
justice
whittaker,
may
i
address
my
remarks
again
to
you
with
respect
to
this
question
of
diligence
and
the
reasonableness
with
respect
to
it
before
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
voyage.
as
i
pointed
out,
it
is
a
double
burden
and
the
items
that
i
listed
before
related
to
--
before
the
commencement
of
the
voyage
back
in
italy.
at
the
beginning
of
the
voyage,
there
are
two
possible
sources
of
evidence
on
that
particular
issue.
first
of
all,
insofar
as
the
ship
owner
is
concerned,
it
will
have
to
rely
primarily
on
the
testimony
of
the
master
and
the
chief
mate
of
the
vessel
itself
on
that
particular
issue
because
they
were
the
men
who
were
charged
with
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
making
whatever
inspections
were
necessary
with
respect
to
the
seaworthiness
of
the
vessel
while
it
was
away
from
its
home
territory
and
its
home
port.
now
then,
there
is
possible
--
there
is
possibly
another
witness
or
two
in
houston
or
in
new
orleans,
which
might
have
some
evidence
to
give
in
this
case
if
a
question
of
proper
or
improper
stowage
comes
up.
the
facts
as
i
know
them,
there
is
not
any
question
that
stowage
involved
and
unless
there
is
a
question
of
proper
and
improper
stowage,
i
don't
contemplate
the
necessity
of
any
witnesses
at
all
in
either
houston
or
new
orleans,
but
at
best
on
just
a
part
--
part
of
the
evidence
on
this
one
half
of
the
respondent's
burden.
it's
possibly
available
in
the
ports
of
new
orleans
and
houston.
now
the
other
issue
in
the
case,
all
of
the
evidence
is
available
only
in
italy.
that
is
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
damages
to
which
the
respondents
would
be
entitle
if
petitioners
are
liable
for
the
loss
and
damage
which
has
occurred.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
market
value
of
the
goods
at
destination.
and
they
have
to
establish
not
only
the
market
value
of
the
goods
at
destination.
they
also
have
to
establish
the
nature
and
the
extent
of
the
laws
in
what
the
value
of
the
cargo
was
in
its
damaged
condition
and
i
think
if
that
there
is
a
--
may
possibly
based
on
experts
in
this
country
that
the
court
might
permit
to
testify
with
respect
to
market
value
in
italy,
but
primarily,
your
market
value
on
the
date
of
the
arrival
of
the
vessel
would
have
to
come
from
my
italian
sources.
so,
as
i
see
it,
all
of
the
evidence
in
connection
with
the
two
issues
that
are
really
involved
in
this
case
except
possibly
for
a
witness
or
two
in
houston
or
in
new
orleans
is
--
is
obtainable
primarily
in
italy.
i'm
not
saying
that
we
can't
go
over
there
and
get
their
positions
and
come
back
over
and
try
this
lawsuit.
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
what
we
are
considering
is
the
reasonableness
or
the
convenience
of
the
forum
and
i
think
obviously,
that
the
convenience
--
the
only
convenient
forum
in
the
case
is
in
fact
the
courts
of
genoa,
italy
where
all
of
the
evidence
or
substantially
all
of
the
evidence
rather
is
readily
available
for
live
witnesses
and
this
includes
on
the
--
on
the
amount
of
damages,
this
includes
respondents
on
witnesses.
they
had
surveyors
present
at
the
time
that
a
cargo
arrived.
they
ascertain
the
nature
and
extend
of
it
and
they're
all
witnesses
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
damages
are
available
in
italy
to
the
court
there.
of
course,
we
have
some
translation
problems
involved
somewhere
along
the
line
whether
the
case
is
tried
in
america
or
is
tried
in
italy.
something
is
going
to
have
to
be
translated,
but
i
submit
that
with
substantially
all
of
the
evidence
coming
from
my
italian
witnesses
that
the
translations
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
substantially
greater
in
the
united
states
than
in
italy,
or
as
i
see
the
matter,
primarily,
the
only
translation
to
be
involved
would
be
of
the
bill
of
lading.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
can't
tell
you
the
name
of
the
tribunal,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
clause
does
not
specifically
designate
the
tribunal.
it
just
says
in
genoa.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it
is
pending
in
genoa,
but
what
court
is
this
pending
in,
in
genoa,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
have
copies
of
those
court
papers.
so
what
--
to
just
exactly
what
tribunal
it's
in,
i
do
not
know,
but
i
would
assume
that
the
able
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
it
in
--
has
it
in
a
court
familiar
with
maritime
matters.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
well,
i
just
have
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you,
mr.
justice
harlan.
that's
a
problem
that's
worried
me
ever
since
i
got
in
this
case,
whether
we
had
the
burden
to
show
that
the
agreement
was
reasonable
or
they
had
the
burden
to
show
that
it
was
unreasonable.
we
have
tried
to
carry
the
burden
so
the
court
would
have
the
information
available
and
i
think
the
record
amply
reflects
the
circumstances
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
agreement
regardless
of
whose
burden
if
the
--
whose
burden
it
is.
the
court
i
believe
and
the
second
circuit
speaks
in
terms
of
the
agreement
being
enforceable
if
it
is
not
shown
to
be
an
unreasonable
one.
i
believe
that's
why
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
believe
it
is
that
substantially
--
substantially,
that's
what
it
is
except
it
is
--
it
is
a
much
stronger
case,
it
seems
to
me
than
a
pure
case
of
forum
non
conveniens
because
here
are
two
parties
who
have
agreed
by
contract,
the
american
courts
and
the
italian
courts
both
have
jurisdiction,
but
by
agreement,
we
in
effect
agree
that
the
italian
courts
should
have
more
convenient
forum.
that's
where
we
want
to
litigate
this
case.
so
i
think
it's
stronger
even
than
your
forum
non
conveniens
cases.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
it
is
binding
under
the
mcallister
case
so
this
court
is
binding
unless
clearly
erroneous.
it's
a
fact
binding.
it's
an
ascertainment
by
the
district
judge
that
under
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
reasonable
forum
is
italy.
now,
under
mcallister,
unless
the
district
court
is
clearly
erroneous
in
that
determination,
then
i
believe
it's
binding
on
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
it's
binding
on
this
court.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
there
are
two
very
different
things
but
the
thing
i
think
that
creates
the
confusion
in
the
minds
of
some,
including
myself
is
a
fact
that
the
same
factors
that
determine
the
reasonableness
of
a
forum,
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
agreement.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
quite
true.
i
see
the
distinction
the
court
is
making
now.
i
did
--
i
didn't
see
it
earlier.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
not
so
far.
as
i
am
concerned,
i
don't
think
so.
i
submit
that
a
party
who
makes
such
an
agreement
to
the
--
to
a
contract
should
not
be
able
to
say
that
it
is
not
enforceable.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
believe
so.
yes,
sir.
i
think
so
very
strongly.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
assume.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
would
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
that's
true.
they
would
be
attempting
to
set
it
aside
on
the
basis
of
not
being
able
to
make
an
arm's
length
deals
between
the
parties,
and
therefore,
something
that
can
do
coercion
of
fraud.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that
is
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
united
states
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
is
expressly
made
to
apply
to
this
shipment
in
the
bill
of
lading,
and
it
would
undoubtedly
have
to
be
applied
by
the
italian
court.
but
for
the
extension
of
time
granted
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations
in
the
united
states
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
would
apply
in
italy.
the
contract
--
the
bill
of
lading
expressly
makes
the
united
states
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
apply
to
this
shipment.
there
is
no
question,
but
what
the
petitioner
has
been
able
to
adequately
institute
its
case
in
italy,
well
within
time,
there'll
be
no
question
of
limitations
with
respect
to
the
further
assertion
of
the
claim
in
this
case.
there
can't
be
any
question
about
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
bill
of
lading
expressly
says
that
if
there
are
any
terms
to
the
bill
of
lading
that
are
contrary
to
united
states
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act,
those
terms
are
void.
so,
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
expressly
applies.
it
has
to
be
applied
by
the
court
in
italy.
one
other
--
one
other
point
which
i
should
like
to
try
to
consider
with
the
court
and
that
relates
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
that
this
agreement
is
not
broad
enough
to
cover
in
rem
as
well
as
in
personam
actions.
i
want
to
make
just
a
few
comments
with
respect
to
this
and
save
my
remaining
time,
if
i
may,
for
a
possible
rebuttal
tomorrow.
first
of
all,
a
look
at
the
clause,
a
reading
of
the
clause
will
indicate
the
obvious
intent
of
the
party
that
any
legal
proceedings
be
started
in
genoa,
italy
that
they
be
handled
and
carried
on
in
genoa,
italy.
only
if
we
can
--
if
we
uphold
the
validity
of
the
agreement,
only
if
we
can
say
that
the
vessel
itself
is
a
separate
and
distinct
legal
entity
can
you
divorce
the
in
rem
action
from
the
in
personam
action
and
permit
the
in
rem
action
to
proceed
in
houston
while
the
in
personam
action
proceeds
in
italy.
now
then,
this
court
has
--
had
occasion
to
consider
the
personification
of
the
vessel
on
a
separate
legal
entity
theory
on
many
occasions.
i
decided
three
cases
in
my
initial
brief,
not
from
this
particular
court,
but
dealing
with
the
longshoremen's
act.
they're
from
courts
of
appeals,
one
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
even
in
which
a
longshoreman
employed
by
the
vessel
had
sued
the
vessel
owner,
and
was
held
to
not
be
able
to
maintain
that
suit
because
of
the
exclusive
remedy
provisions
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
and
genoa's
counsel
then
sues
the
vessel
in
rem
and
says
that
my
employer
was
the
vessel
owner
and
i
am
now
suing
the
vessel
in
rem.
it
is
a
separate
and
a
distinct
entity
and
the
court,
in
all
of
those
cases,
struck
it
down
and
said,
“no,”
that
when
you
talk
about
the
vessel
owner
and
the
vessel
itself.
in
effect,
what
this
court
has
said
when
you
say
the
vessel
owner
is
not
liable,
but
the
vessel
is
liable,
you're
talking
in
riddles.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no
sir.
you
mean
with
respect
to
where
the
suits
could
be
brought?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
unless
--
unless
there
is
something
in
the
passenger
ticket
to
the
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
in
which
that
has
occurred.
i
simply
can't
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
can't
--
i
can't
think
of
any.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
can't
answer
the
question.
i
simply
don't
know.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
would
think
so
if
you
have
passengers
from
america
on
the
vessel
and
they're
all
in
united
states
very
evidenced
with
respect
to
the
circumstances
the
injury
or
such
as
to
make
it
readily
available
here.
that's
the
reason
for
the
requirement
that
the
agreement
be
reasonable
before
the
courts
will
enforce
it.
now
then,
this
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
if
i
understood
his
question
--
if
i
understood
his
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
--
i
guess
you'd
call
it
an
ouster
of
jurisdiction,
my
side
of
this
case
that
there's
a
little
bit
of
repugnance
over
that
phrase
to
me,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
ouster
of
the
court's
jurisdiction.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
they
have
jurisdiction,
he
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case
in
a
district
court.
there
any
question
about
it.
limitation
had
not
run.
they
would
still
be
in
a
position
of
being
able
to
start
a
claim
in
that
same
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
may
it
please
the
court.
the
onset
i
would
like
to
say,
if
the
petitioners
--
because
they
attempted
to
get
their
respondent
to
live
up
to
the
provision
of
the
contract,
they
wouldn't
take
testimony
in
this
case
until
they
got
a
decision
of
the
district
court
on
that
question.
if
that
makes
us
unreasonable
in
connection
with
this
litigation,
then
we
have
taken
an
unreasonable
attitude
with
respect
to
it.
now
on
the
depositions
of
the
crew
in
houston,
this
libel
was
filed
two
days
before
those
depositions
were
noticed.
they
saw
them
on
two
grounds,
discovery
and
de
bene
esse
under
the
admiralty
statutes.
we
objected
to
the
depositions
because
our
first
knowledge
of
this
case
in
any
damage
came
when
the
libel
was
filed.
we
had
no
information
whatsoever
from
italy.
we
had
no
opportunity
to
get
any
information
to
prepare
for
the
deposition.
this
matter
was
submitted
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
he
held
in
both
instances
that
the
respondent
was
not
legally
entitled
to
take
the
deposition.
either
de
bene
esse
or
as
discovery.
no
further
attempts
were
made
to
get
these
depositions.
we
received
one
phone
call
in
the
summer
of
1956
indicating
that
they
thought
the
ship
would
be
back
in
september
and
they
might
want
to
take
the
depositions
then.
at
that
time
the
motion
was
pending
before
the
united
states
district
court
and
no
effort
was
made
to
proceed
with
the
deposition.
i
think
that
really
is
a
collateral
matter.
it's
true.
have
we
not
had
the
jurisdictional
question
involved
in
this
case,
this
case
would
have
long
ago
been
tried
and
disposed
off
before
the
united
states
district
court
down
in
houston.
but
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
convenience
of
the
forum
for
a
trial
of
the
issues.
now
i
want
to
allude
just
very
briefly
to
the
muller
case
of
the
second
circuit.
i
think
that
in
the
muller
case,
you
have
just
as
much
evidence
needed
in
the
muller
case
and
the
united
states
as
you
have
in
this
case.
that
cargo
was
destined
for
philadelphia.
the
market
value
of
the
cargo
did
not
reach
philadelphia
would
have
to
be
proved
and
obviously
would
have
to
be
approved
by
the
best
available
evidence
that
would
be
available
in
philadelphia.
all
of
the
other
evidence
was
foreign.
and
i
think
the
record
amply
reflects
that
in
this
particular
case,
substantially
all
of
the
evidence
is
obtainable
only
in
italy.
now
i
recognize
that
mr.
mcgowan
and
i
don't
agree
on
this
particular
point.
what
i'm
saying
to
this
court,
i
only
wish
that
my
duty
in
representing
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
show
due
diligence
to
make
the
vessel
sea
worthy
attached
in
houston
and
new
orleans.
boy
that
would
be
easy
and
i
submit
to
this
court,
i
would
be
delighted
if
that
was
the
extent
of
my
burden
in
this
case.
but
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
says,
“you
have
to
prove
due
diligence
to
make
the
vessel
seaworthy
before
and
after
commencement
of
the
voyage.”
we
can't
just
stop
by
proving
the
condition
of
the
vessel.
at
houston,
we've
got
to
show
that
we
have
used
due
diligence
all
along
the
line.
we
don't
have
to
show
that
the
vessel
in
fact
was
seaworthy
at
the
time
it
left
houston.
we
only
have
to
show
that
diligence
was
used.
it
may
have
been
un-seaworthy
when
it
left
italy
because
of
a
latent
defect.
but
we
don't
have
to
prove
it
was
seaworthy,
we
have
to
show
our
diligence
and
we
have
to
show
our
diligence
starting
not
in
houston
and
new
orleans
but
we
have
to
start
in
italy.
and
in
all
probability
to
make
out
a
case,
we're
going
to
have
to
start
with
the
last
annual
inspection
of
this
vessel.
just
when
this
was,
i
don't
know.
it
may
have
been
as
long
as
eight
or
nine
months
prior
to
the
time
that
the
vessel
broke
down
in
italy.
so
it's
not
a
simple
matter
of
offering
a
few
witnesses
in
houston
or
a
few
witnesses
in
new
orleans
and
the
petitioners
discharging
their
burden
show
that
they
used
due
diligence
to
make
this
vessel
seaworthy.
our
burden
is
substantially
greater
than
this
and
i
submit
to
this
court
on
the
fact
the
amount
of
evidence
required
in
this
country,
in
the
muller
case
and
in
this
case
they
are
almost
identical.
now
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
elude
you
some
questions
previously
asked
by
some
members
of
the
court,
particularly
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made
an
inquiry
early
in
the
argument
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
shipper
actually
signed
the
bill
of
lading.
it's
true
the
shipper
does
not
actually
sign
the
bill
of
lading,
but
the
shippers
own
broker,
the
shippers
agent
in
houston
prepares
the
bill
of
lading
and
submits
it
to
the
vessel
owner
for
his
signature
and
the
vessel
owner
issues
it
if
it
is
in
proper
form.
now
admittedly,
the
broker
normally
gets
a
printed
form
of
the
particular
line
on
which
he
is
shipping.
that
is
the
type
of
bill
of
lading
that
the
ship
owner
wants
and
normally
requires
but
it
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
cannot
say
that
with
respect
to
an
agreement
such
as
this,
i
have
ever
had
a
case
and
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
petitioner's
printed
(inaudible)
form.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
sir.
i
never
saw
a
bill
of
lading
that
wasn't
formidable
and
i
never
saw
a
bill
of
lading
that
you
didn't
need
a
magnifying
--
a
magnifying
glass
to
read.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
we
are
--
we
are
consulted
frequently
in
our
practice
both
by
american
and
by
foreign
ship
owners
with
respect
to
the
advisability
of
either
deleting
or
adding
additional
policies
to
the
bills
of
lading.
i
cannot
state
to
the
court
in
my
tenure
experience
that
we
have
ever
had
a
request
for
a
deletion
of
this
type
of
clause
or
whether
or
not,
it
would
be
granted.
i
--
i
have
not
had
any
experience
on
that.
we're
consulted
frequently
with
respect
to
clauses
either
deleting
certain
portions
of
clauses
or
adding
additional
clauses
on
the
front
of
the
bill
of
lading
to
specify
the
particular
requirements.
this
often
is
necessary
in
connection
with
the
financial
arrangements
that
have
been
made
and
so
far
as
the
cargo
is
concern.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
there
--
there
is
a
--
a
conference
which
--
a
conference
of
things
you've
covered
in
both
foreign
and
american
which
sets
the
rate,
yes.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
i
think
they
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
i
think
they
make
distinctions
between
tumblers
and
glasses.
i
mean
they
go
that
far.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it's
not
an
icc
carrier.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
i
think
possibly
even
more
in
detail
than
the
--
the
normal
icc
carriers.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no
sir.
and
--
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
one
other
question
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
italy
had
adapted
the
brussels
convention.
it
did
so
in
1939
that
it's
cited
in
our
brief
but
if
they
had
adapted
the
convention
in
1939.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
39
was
the
date
which
i
had.
now
they
mention
--
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
had
a
question
with
respect
to
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
and
the
possible
lessening
of
liability
under
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
of
by
this
particular
agreement.
counsel
touched
on
that
very
briefly,
but
i
think
if
you
will
look
--
if
you
will
read
the
muller
case
which
undoubtedly,
you
will
do,
you
will
see
the
real
basis
for
their
argument
that
--
that
it
lessens
liability.
it
is
nothing
more
than
it
would
probably
be
cheaper
for
them
to
try
the
case
as
they
would
add
some
extra
expenses
if
they
went
to
italy
or
they
argue
in
their
brief
that
if
you
send
them
to
italy
then
they're
going
to
have
to
forego
any
$1,000
claim
they
have
because
it's
not
economically
feasible
to
submit
a
thousand
dollar
claim
in
a
foreign
form.
those
are
--
those
are
just
great
stretches
of
the
imagination
to
try
to
bring
this
agreement
within
the
limiting
liability
clause.
and
of
course
in
both
instances
you
have
to
assume
that
the
foreign
tribunal
is
not
going
to
correctly
apply
the
law
or
that
they're
going
to
ignore
the
provision
in
the
contract
with
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
apply
before
you
can
in
fact
have
any
lessening
of
liability
and
i
don't
think
that
--
that
this
court
or
any
court
should
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
a
foreign
tribunal
will
not
apply
the
contract
in
the
terms
as
written.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
are
you
referring
to
the
italian
statute
which
prohibits
an
agreement
such
as
this?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
the
legislature
of
italy
or
whatever
the
legislative
body
there
is
has
judicially
or
has
legislatively
declared
the
public
policy
of
italy
to
make
this
clauses
void
and
my
position
on
that
simply
is
that
that
is
something
it
is
within
the
realm
of
the
congress
with
respect
to
these
clauses
and
it
was
aware
of
such
clauses
at
the
time
it
passed
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
across
canada
and
australia.
both
had
such
clauses
as
that
in
them
that
you
have
to
sue
in
australia
and
you
have
to
sue
in
canada,
and
congress
did
not
include
any
such
clause
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
of
united
states.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
nothing
with
respect
to
agreements
as
to
the
place
of
forum.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
they
specifically
provided
with
respect
to
the
duty
of
diligence
required,
with
respect
to
what
exemptions
would
be
allowed
to
carrier
and
the
burden
is
placed
on
the
carrier
to
show
that
if
the
cargo
is
damaged
that
it
counts
within
one
of
the
exceptions
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
creating
a
uniformity
with
respect
to
a
carrier's
liability
for
the
shippers.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
couldn't
answer
that
question
specifically.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
that
was
some
of
both,
i
think
it
was
some
of
both.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that,
some
of
both
rather
than
simply
a
codification
of
existing
law,
i
think
it
was
some
of
both.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
anything
in
the
legislative
history
in
which
a
specific
clause
such
as
this
was
considered
by
the
congress.
all
the
legislative
history
indicates
to
us,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
congress
was
aware
of
acts
in
canada
and
acts
in
australia
that
had
such
clauses
in
them
as
well
as
the
acts
of
various
other
countries.
they
were
very
careful
in
enacting
this
legislation
to
ensure
that
they
had
a
uniform
act.
they
were
trying
to
come
as
close
as
they
possibly
could
to
the
acts
of
other
countries.
and
the
legislative
history
even
indicates
that
they
have
--
they
corrected
some
--
some
clerical
errors
in
the
acts
of
great
britain
for
the
sake
of
uniformity.
i
say
therefore
from
that
and
the
fact
that
they
re
--
repeatedly
refer
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
acts
of
canada
and
to
the
acts
of
australia
that
they
had
those
two
acts
before
they
amended
--
if
they
read
the
acts,
they
saw
such
a
clause
as
this
but
as
far
as
actually
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no
sir.
there's
nothing
actually
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
such
a
clause
was
proposed
or
that
it
was
argued
on
neither
the
floor
of
the
house
of
the
senate.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
--
i
did
not
--
i
did
not
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
just
have
to
go
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
say
to
the
court,
why
would
they
do
it
by
implication
rather
than
doing
it
frontally
by
including
a
--
a
provision
in
the
act
prohibiting
such
agreements.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well
i
think
simply
because
of
congress'
attempt
to
specifically
spell
out
those
things
that
it
wanted
to
apply
to
ocean
shipments
and
those
that
it
did
not.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
at
least
insofar
as
internal
cases
were
concerned
not
with
respect
to
admiralty
and
maritime
law,
there
were
no
such
cases,
mr.
justice
black,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
i
believe
congress
should
have
acted
on
this
is
simply
because
congress
was
aware
or
should
have
been
aware
from
the
legislative
history
that
most
of
the
countries
did
not
permit
such
--
did
not
have
such
clauses
in
their
bill
of
lading,
but
two,
had
prohibited
such
agreements
which
would
indicate
the
congress
at
least
that
some
of
the
other
countries
dealing
with
this
problem
felt
it
necessary
to
have
a
specific
agreement
in
the
act
and
as
congress
was
trying
to
eliminate
as
many
controversies
as
possible
between
shipper
and
ship
owner,
that
it
would
have
--
it
seems
to
me
congress
would
have
specifically
cover
this
particular
problem.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
not
that
i
can
find
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
the
muller
case
as
i
understand
it,
says
that
these
contracts
are
enforceable
if
reasonable
and
the
question
of
reasonableness
turns
on
the
convenience
of
the
forum.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it's
new,
i
think
not
withstanding
the
--
not
withstanding
the
agreement
in
the
bill
of
lading
under
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
swift
&
company,
that
the
court's
action
can
and
should
be
sustained
on
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
without
regard
to
the
agreement.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
there
--
there
are
no
specific
references
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
history
on
point.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
not
as
to
this
point.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
they're
just
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
they
were
mentioned
several
times
in
the
legislative
history.
i
do
not
recall
at
this
time;
however,
what
specific
portions
of
the
act
were
before.
the
legislative
history
is
simply
not
too
helpful
in
this
particular
case.
thank
you
very
much!
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
my
answer
simply
to
that
is
simply
this,
that
the
obvious
intention
of
the
party
was
that
it
includes
both
in
personam
and
in
rem
and
if
actually
you
don't
have
two
causes
of
action,
you
have
one
cause
of
action
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
pointed
out.
the
recovery
in
personam
is
res
adjudicata
and
decision
in
rem
and
you
have
actually
the
in
rem
proceeding
as
a
security
device
for
the
purpose
of
guaranteeing
the
payment
of
any
damages
to
which
they
may
be
entitled.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
has
come
up
with
the
best
answer
made
by
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
word
“agent.”
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
--
i
know
but
quick
to
see
on
the
answer
the
court
reported
me.
i
think
this
is
probably
a
case
were
a
counsel
couldn't
see
the
forest
or
the
trees.
normally,
looking
at
this
clause,
i
would
not
say
that
agent
included
the
ship
but
normally
looking
at
this
clause,
i
would
not
have
advised
the
client
and
i
would
not
now
advise
the
client
that
it
did
not
also
include
in
rem
action
because
of
the
obvious
intent
of
the
parties.
i
don't
believe
mr.
mcgowan
would
either.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well
of
course
all
i
can
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
all
i
can
say
to
the
court
is,
i
agree
it's
rather
inarticulately
drawn
and
of
course
obviously
i
had
--
i
had
been
drawing
it
out.
i
have
included
the
word
“ship”
and
certainly
will
from
now
on.
the
word
“ship”
is
--
the
word
--
the
word
“ship”
is
used
further
on
down
in
the
--
in
the
clause
not
withstanding
the
ship
as
represented
there.
there's
no
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice's
question
other
than
the
fact
that
the
clause
is
inarticulately
drawn
and
of
course
the
contention
would
--
could
never
have
been
made
if
the
word
“ship”
were
used
and
it's
just
inarticulately
drawn.
perhaps
the
language
difficulty
is
responsible,
the
only
answer
to
that
i
can
think
of.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it's
--
it's
in
the
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it's
in
the
english
language
and
it's
one
of
those
(inaudible)
if
you
don't
would
be
an
italian,
they
wouldn't
have
understood
it
because
they
didn't
have
the
chance
to
translate
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that
--
that
rule
would
ordinarily
apply
in
this
particular
case
as
it
does
in
all
cases.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
perhaps
i
did,
but
i
couldn't
be
less
than
frank
with
the
court.
all
i
can
say
there
is
that
the
court
enforces
that
rule
if
i
may.
i
know
i'm
indulging
on
the
court's
time.
the
court
applies
the
rule
that
the
contractors
construed
against
the
framer
of
the
contract.
but
it
does
not
do
so,
if
to
do
so
violate
the
obvious
intent
of
the
parties.
that's
my
position.
that's
my
position
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
there
are
certainly
two
sides
to
the
coin.
thank
you
sir!
