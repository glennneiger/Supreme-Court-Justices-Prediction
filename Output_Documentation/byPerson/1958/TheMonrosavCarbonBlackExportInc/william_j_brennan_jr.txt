justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
italian
tribunal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
italian
jurisdiction,
i
believe
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
it
pending,
in
genoa?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
the
amount
involves
--
what
gives
jurisdiction
and
so
forth,
i
should
suppose
that
the
reason
the
court
can
decline
jurisdiction
is
on
the
ground
if
the
parties
themselves
if
there
agreement
is
reasonable,
can
oust
the
court's
jurisdiction?q
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
by
your
fine
print
observation
that
the
shipper
was
not
aware
of
this
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
the
shipper
was
not
aware
of
this
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
and
the
fact
is
because
the
bill
of
lading
is
signed
only
by
the
carrier,
we
ought
to
take
judicial
notice
that
shipper's
in
fact
on
the
matter
never
take
a
look
at
the
bill
of
lading,
is
this
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
constitution
(inaudible),
because
congress
hasn't
authorized
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
new
york
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
--
are
you
going
to
argue
--
are
you
going
to
argue
at
some
point
your
contention
that
this
clause
violates
the
carriage
goods
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
like
to
hear
that
myself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
the
substantive
law
which
the
court
in
genoa,
italy
would
apply
would
be
identical
to
the
law
which
the
united
states
district
court
and
texas
would
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
but
i
--
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
you.
that
the
bill
of
lading
incorporates
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
by
saying
that
the
law
applicable
and
the
amount
of
damage
to
freight
shall
be
as
provided
in
the
carriage
goods
by
sea
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
assume
they
wouldn't
but
some
of
the
country
with
that
public
policy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
be
wrong
in
your
view
that
american
shippers
couldn't
touch
a
clause
in
this
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
ship
owner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
--
where
an
agent
include
the
ship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ship
owner's
agent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ship?
you
don't
like
the
ship
to
be
included.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
question.
it's
not
considered
in
either
brief
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
that
language
might
include
the
ship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
admirably
as
we
all
know,
it
gives
personality
to
the
ship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
ship
is
the
agent
in
that
respect,
possibly,
arguably
is
it
not
of
the
owner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
separate
personnel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
of
course
you
wouldn't
contend
that
there
can
be
two
separate
coverages
on
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
want
to
pursue
the
point
of
that
thought
that
occurred
at
this
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
on
the
argument
that
you
are
making
based
on
the
second
circuit
case,
is
you
seemed
to
be
on
a
head-on
collision
with
your
opponent
as
to
where
the
convenience,
balance
of
convenience
lies.
you
say
all
the
witnesses
in
new
york
this
is
all
the
witness
are
related.
are
you
as
far
apart
as
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
printed
form
which
mr.
mcgowan
and
held
up
to
us
is
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
form
of
looking
document.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
is
a
practice
of
shippers
to
--
to
delete
anything
or
add
anything
and
--?
