unknown
speaker
this
is
a
clause
contained
in
all
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
you
can
have
that,
in
fact,
you
can
have
the
right
to
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
so
therefore,
as
i
understand
you
(inaudible)
unreasonable.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
would.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
on
right
for
lack
of
ideology.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
propositions
that
this
is
a
subject
offered
in
the
contract
or
(inaudible)
it
does
violate
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act?
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
contract
(inaudible)
and
would
normally
void
insofar
as
it
violates
some
positive
use
law
or
public
policy.
unknown
speaker
well
--
what
does
that
mean?
because
you
know
it
had
a
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
public
policy
as
the
secondary
suggestion
you're
your
answer
to
the
problem
of
whether
this
term
lack
the
coverage
in
this
lading
executing
(inaudible)
you
think
is
not
violating
public
policy,
are
they
bilaterally
binding?
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
arguing
that
this
coverage
is
not
enforceable
because
it
violates
public
policy,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
in
violating
other
policies,
you
have
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
make?
unknown
speaker
or
we
have
only
validly
made
them
unreasonable
contracts?
unknown
speaker
yes,
(inaudible)
upon
the
contract
which
both
of
the
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well
i'm
having
difficulty
understanding
just
what
(inaudible)
that
the
contract
is
void
(inaudible).
it
is
what
is
accepted
by
the
shipper
or
what
you
can
say
was
and
therefore
we
can
say
if
it's
violating
the
promise.
unknown
speaker
can
i
find
it
often
really
intimidating
that
it
wasn't
made
on
arms
length?
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
no
contract?
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
enforce
right
under
this
as
there's
no
contract
to
one
purpose
and
to
another
purpose,
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
the
purpose
of
that
in
the
carriage
of
goods
act
except
that
that
it's
a
commercial
document
which
indicates
the
nature
of
transaction,
the
dealership
and
the
carrier.
that's
the
only
preference
of
putting
that
into
the
carriage
of
goods
act
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
has
been
for
century
the
way
shippers
ship
and
carries
itself
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
the
bills
of
lading?
unknown
speaker
the
carriage
of
goods
act
will
specify
what
must
be
in,
what
must
not
be
in
and
what
must
be
out.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
mean
by
being
up.
unknown
speaker
the
carrier,
a
bill
of
lading
didn't
start
with
the
carriage
goods
act.
the
bill
of
lading
has
been
enforced
i
suppose
in
the
17th
century.
unknown
speaker
well
--
unknown
speaker
well
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
grounds
sir
that
it
is
to
oust
the
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
it
does
oust
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
the
conflict
for
bodily
harm
agrees
upon
a
particular
venue
in
a
court.
unknown
speaker
i
presume
it
should
have
some
weight
if
we
were
to
act
as
law
makers
and
it
is
adamant
to
see
as
i
am
suggesting
and
determine
the
policy.
but
it
have
some
effect
--
it
should
have
some
effects
on
that
shouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
district
court,
another
one?
unknown
speaker
these
changes
of
vision
--
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
to
constitute
or
deny
(inaudible)
adapt
the
standard
form
of
the
bill
of
lading
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
or
this
--
this
specific
outlaw
reads
declaratory
of
what
was
--
if
i
may
use
a
rule
--
a
common
rule
--
a
common
law
admiralty.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
think
(inaudible)
that
--
that
i've
got.
what
is
your
answer
to
mr.
mcgowan's
suggestion
that
this
clause
27
in
any
event
does
not
include
in
the
in
rem
action?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
question
not
an
answer.
