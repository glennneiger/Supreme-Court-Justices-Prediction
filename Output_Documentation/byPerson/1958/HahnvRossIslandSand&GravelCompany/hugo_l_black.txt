in
that
case,
the
state
of
washington
had
held
that
he
could
not
recover.
justice
hugo

what
--
what
reasoning
did
the
court
find
to
be
so
sure
that
this
man
could
recover
under
the
--
under
the
federal
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
were
quite
a
number
--
quite
a
number
of
cases
before
the
davis
case
where
i
should
think
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
this
was
one
of
those
mysterious
local
situations
where
and
wouldn't
know
whether
which
one
he
could
recover
on.
justice
hugo
l.

what
argument
did
the
court
of

make
in
deciding
the
fact
that
it
was
plain
that
it
--
have
it
to
satisfy
through
the

opinion
that
it
knew
that
this
would
come
under

may
i
ask
what
your

to
do
with

(voice

yes.

is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
--
justice

black
mr.

justice
hugo

black
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
that
this
company
has
private
insurance
that
would
protect
him
in
case
his
judgement
was
rendered
against
him?
justice

i'm
talking
about

justice

black
i'm
talking
about
this
company.
justice

black
in
other
words,
this
company
is
protected
by
insurance
against
the
judgment
of
this
kind

compensation
pay?
justice

and
i
understood
you
to
say
he
had
all
of
these.

he

--
any
judgement
rendered
against

justice

i
understood
you
to
say
that

kind
of

here.
justice

if
he
gets
--
if

he

this

yes.
justice

could
he

could

sue
you

you
are

well,
i'm
not
talking
about
on

could

sue

could

sue

is
that

now,
when
was
that?
justice

black
(voice

your
compensation
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
your
compensation
law
the
same
then
as
it
is
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
provided
that
a
man
was
not
covered
unless
he
accepted
it,
and
yet,
a
suit
was
sustained
against
the
man
for
compensation
who
was
not
--
had
not
accepted
yet,
is
that
what
i
understood
you
to
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
just
asking.
as
i
understand
it,
the
law
provides
that
if
a
man
to
be
on
writ
has
to
accept
the
company
employer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
did
not
accept
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
is
not
under
it,
he
rejected
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
law
--
state
law
provides
that
when
he
is
rejected,
he
is
not
under
it,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet,
you
say
that
he
could
--
a
person
can
still
sue
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
compensation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
sure,
however,
that
any
--
if
a
suit
should
be
made
on
that,
maintained
by
the
court
and
he
was
held
liable,
you
insured
against
it
and
you
insured
also
against
the
suit
for
negligence
such
as
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
through
all
the
time,
isn't
it,
except
one
case
you
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
the
counsel
for
the
state
and
for
this
board
has
said
it
that
there
is
no
right
to
sue
under
the
law?
if
you
--
for
compensation,
if
your
--
the
employer
has
rejected
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
sue
under
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
is
a
situation
where
an
employer
wants
to
--
is
advantage.he
has
a
right
like
--
like
anybody
else
provided
by
insurance
against
any
prospects
or
suits
that
are
filed
against
him
for
negligence
or
anything
else.
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
the
statute
say
that
he
can
provide
it
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it's
just
a
volunteer
thing
on
his
part
and
if
he
decides,
he
can
make
more
money
that
way
or
to
cost
him
less,
why,
he
buys
his
insurance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
uncertain,
if
there
were
other
facts
to
be
considered?
what
facts
ought
to
be
considered?
who
would
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
ever
have
any
certainty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
did
he,
with
those
cases,
say
that
no
state
law
could
ever
have
any
application?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
moore
and
--
moore
and
mccormack
made
no
such
statement
as
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
behind
that
was
the
knickerbocker
ice
doctrine,
there's
a
difference,
isn't
there,
between
supremacy
of
the
law,
the
knickerbocker
ice
doctrine
that
even
though
congress
or
the
government
wants
to
leave
the
state's
freedom
and
enforce
their
own
law
that
they
can't
do
it
under
the
constitution?
that's
the
difference,
isn't
it?
the
knickerbocker
ice
case,
in
which
was
a
part
of
the
jensen
line,
went
further
than
jensen,
knocked
out
a
--
a
law
of
a
state
on
compensation
on
the
ground
that
a
state
--
congress
couldn't
even
agree
for
a
state
to
have
a
compensation
law,
and
the
federal
government
couldn't
agree
that
it
is
exclusive.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
don't
think
any
of
the
cases
you
cited,
unless
i'm
wrong,
and
i
happen
to
have
written
the
two
as
you
just
said
it,
if
they
did
indicate
that
there
could
be
no
state
law
enforceable
in
that
field,
the
--
i
didn't
know
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
something
like
it,
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
something
like
the
doctrine
of
interstate
commerce
that
they
have
--
the
state
can
be
left
free
as
it
was
in
the
old
politics
cases.
it
was
pointed
out
in
that
ancient
case,
states
had
been
doing
something
in
interstate
commerce
all
through
the
years
and
if
it
didn't
conflict
with
the
law
of
congress
or
the
constitution
itself
but
they
were
free
to
do
it.
i
don't
see
where
you
get
the
idea
that
those
cases
would
bar
oregon
from
having
a
compensation
law
whatever
the
knickerbocker
ice
company
case
might
be,
if
it
was
still
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
because
i
--
i'm
interested
--
greatly
interested
in
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
unfortunately,
they
don't
have
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
logical
difficulty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
the
davis
case,
it
was
written
on
the
premise
perhaps
that
not
logic
but
experience
has
been
the
life
of
the
law.
we
were
confronted
with
a
situation
where
people
didn't
know
how
to
proceed.
and
we
just
indicated
that
when
one
have
of
them
got
jurisdiction
in
that
“twilight
zone”
case
was
brought
there,
it
could
proceed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
plenty
of
objections
raised
that
if
it's
covered
by
the
state,
it
can't
be
covered
by,
isn't
it?
if
it's
covered
by
the
state,
can
--
can
the
man
get
protection
in
the
longshoremen's
act?
does
it
say
anything
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
be?
why
would
it
be
conclusive
in
another
case
should
the
federal
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
be
conclusive
in
another
case
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
parties
before
the
administrative
agency?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they've
had
a
litigation
in
which
the
court
cited
that
oregon
law
doesn't
cover.one
of
its
reasons
is
that
this
was
navigable
water.
and
you
think
if
the
united
states
administrator
of
employers'
compensation
act
would
be
bound
by
that
finding
or
would
they
have
a
right
to
hear
evidence
of
their
own?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hadn't
suspected
that
until
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hadn't
suspected
that
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
needed
to
do
so,
wouldn't
it,
if
he
had
doubt
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
--
it's
not
litigation.
it's
--
it's
not
in
the
nature
of
litigations
(inaudible)
administrative
matter
whether
use
judgment
feel
whether
they
don't
want
to
be
tangled
up
in
the
technicalities
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
take
it
overrule
the
commissioner
on
the
ground
that
he
failed
to
decide
what
the
--
what
the
--
one
of
the
grounds
that
the
state
based
its
conclusion
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it
did,
how
could
that
ended?
before
the
--
under
the
jensen
case
and
under
that
doctrine,
the
court
had
held
that
even
one
of
the
things
occurred
on
navigable
water,
whether
they
look
at
the
instance,
see
how
local
they
were
and
how
non-local
they
were,
and
how
much
by
reason
of
the
locals,
the
--
the
situation
it
would
interfere
with
the
international
aspects
of
the
maritime
law,
it
--
it's
far
more
than
just
a
mere
question
of
navigability
under
those
cases.
what
we
held
was,
that
the
congress
acted
on
the
basis
the
jensen
doctrine
in
that
line
of
cases
would
decide
the
matter
and
nobody
could
tell
where
it
was.
and
as
i
recall
it,
one
of
the
reason
was
not
merely
that
a
man
might
be
able
to
file
a
suit
later
but
he'd
already
be
put
to
the
expense
by
making
a
bad
guess
with
the
cause
in
the
lawsuit
where
neither
he
nor
anybody
else
could
predict
whether
the
state
or
the
federal
government
would
decide
he
was
within
or
without
the
laws.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
neither
with
us.
what
i
meant
was
if
one
of
the
difficulties
of
the
quagmire
that
the
situation
put
a
man
in,
he
might
go
to
all
the
expense,
go
on
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
the
nation
and
then
have
it
held
when
he
got
there,
that
he
had
gone
into
the
wrong
court
and
puts
all
that
expense
in
trouble
and
all
that
loss
of
time.
so,
your
statement
that
you
would
see
that
he
got
compensation,
doesn't
settle
it.
the
--
the
problem
that
we
saw
would
be
continued
if
we
didn't
adopt
some
kind
of
rule
to
protect
from
the
dilemma
that
the
parties
found
themselves,
both
the
employer
and
the
employee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
oppose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
oppose
that?
suppose
you
went
to
him
and
said
he
couldn't
be
paid
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
that
could
be
appealed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it's
not
merely
a
question,
it
is
automatically
get
his
money.
i
--
i
didn't
think
it
was,
maybe
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
i
thought
maybe
i
misunderstood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
194
or.
130?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
make
no
difference
under
our
holding,
would
it,
unless
we
overruled
the
davis
case
(inaudible)
well,
if
the
jensen
case
should
later
be
overruled
or
not,
because
those
cases
held
that
the
congress
had
adopted
the
rule
of
the
jensen
case,
it
had
said
--
left
some
considerable
state
of
uncertainties,
the
boundary
between
the
two.
