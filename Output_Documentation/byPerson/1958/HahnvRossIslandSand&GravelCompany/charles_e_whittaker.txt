justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
arguing
thereby
and
you
contend
to
that
this
were
not
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
know
that
they
were
navigable
waters?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
excuse
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it
were
--
if
it
is
a
twilight
case,
that
gives
you
what?
that
gives
you
a
choice
of
law,
does
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
between
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
would
it
be
between
compensation
acts.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
sure.
but
one
--
one
law
that
--
that
each
has
to
compensation
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
law
and
federal
longshoremen's
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
both
cover
the
same
field
except
the
latter
applies
only
to
act
--
acting
upon
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
i
wonder
where
the
choice
of
law
or
the
twilight
zone
business
gets
this,
isn't
clear
to
me
just
yet.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
--
all
right.
now
suppose
it
did
apply,
could
have
applied,
it
won't
reject
it,
by
the
employer,
won't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
not
--
not
used
--
do
you
really
mean
that?
that
you're
covered
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act
from
act
--
with
an
acts
over
negligence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
workmen's
compensation
act
doesn't
actually
create
the
common
law
or
right
for
--
or
damages
from
negligence,
does
it?
it
just
says
that
you
still
haven't.
that
you
always
haven't.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
was
taken
away
from
the
compensation
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
the
clause?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what?
you
had
your
old
common
law
rights
with
all
common
law
defenses
eliminated?
