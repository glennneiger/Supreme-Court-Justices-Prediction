mr.
ray
h.
lafky
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
this
case
is
but
another
facet
of
workmen's
compensation.
and
in
my
14
years
of
legal
adviser
to
the
oregon
commission,
i
have
gradually
adjusted
and
adapted
myself
to
the
philosophy
of
the
liberal
construction
of
the
law
which
must
accorded
all
workmen's
compensation
actions
to
the
growing
field,
the
judicial
expansion
of
the
“twilight
zone”
which
was
enunciated
in
the
davis
case.
there
were
more
recent
cases
where
the
conflict
comes
between
various
state
jurisdictions
where
this
court
has
permitted
actions
in
both
states.
and
i
think
the
“twilight
zone”
is
certainly
a
proper
judicial
expansion
of
the
philosophy
of
workmen's
compensation.
now,
actually,
as
we
compare,
for
i
want
to
oversimplify
the
longshore
act
and
the
workmen's
compensation
act
of
oregon,
each
of
them
require
a
certainty
of
compensation
in
the
first
instance.
and
if
the
employer
fails
to
provide
that
certainty
of
compensation,
the
alternative
of
a
negligence
action
is
provided.
let
us
assume
that
the
factual
reverse,
that
the
action
was
under
the
longshore
act
and
he
had
failed
to
provide
his
workmen
under
the
benefits
under
the
longshore
act.
then,
if
action
were
commenced
there,
could
they
say,
“no,
you
have
a
definite
right
over
into
the
workmen's
compensation.
and
also,
you
can't
have
a
damage
action.”
i
think
that
that
maybe
an
oversimplification.
i
--
i
did
wish
to
answer
judge
stewart's
question
in
--
under
the
oregon
law,
an
employer
must
bring
all
of
his
employees
in
a
given
occupation
under
--
he
may
have
separate
occupations
and
have
one
under
and
the
other.
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
this
one
had
rejected,
so
he
hadn't
--
so
far
as
i
know,
none
of
his
--
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
--
employees
were
subject
to
the
workmen's
compensation
law
to
the
extent
that
they
were
entitled
to
compensation.
he
could
have,
at
any
time
withdrawn
it
and
then
his
workmen
would've
been
entitled
to
the
compensation.
now,
if
we
were
to
deal
on
hypothesis
and
what
can
happen,
there
are
two
cases
cited
in
the
briefs.
one
of
which
is
hess
against
the
united
states
which
have
been
cited
by
the
respondent,
259
f.
2d
285.
that
case
involved
six
workmen
on
the
face
of
bonneville
dam
who
were
preparing
to
repair
the
floodings
and
faces
of
the
dam.
they
set
out
from
the
oregon
shore.
they
got
too
close
to
the
spillway,
five
of
them
were
drowned.
no
question
was
raised
by
the
oregon
commission
as
to
the
maritime
coverage
on
this
particular
case.
the
employer
was
shore
based,
he
was
out
there
working
on
a
fix
structure
but
there
was
a
barge,
there
was
an
instrument
of
navigation.
there
was
some
delay
of
the
question
of
whether
oregon
or
washington
should
take.
i
mention
this
case
not
because
of
the
law
involve
but
because
of
the
factual
situation.
that
employer
had
lost
his
financial
surety
in
the
contract
with
the
government.
he
had
state
compensation
with
both
washington
and
oregon,
but
he
had
a
very
minimal
policy
to
protect
him
against
any
possibility
of
maritime
injury
like
possibly
applied
to
the
skipper
of
a
tug
who
was
drowned,
but
he
was
very
dubious
if
it
would
apply
to
any
of
the
other
carpenters
and
so
forth.
now,
what
situation
that
we
have
there?
if
those
workmen
had
proceeded
against
that
employer,
they
would
have
a
right
but
no
effective
remedy
certain.
the
oregon
commission
voluntarily
accepted
those
four
fails
probably,
i
think,
$1000
are
better
in
liability
of
the
state
fund.
the
oregon
supreme
court
is
correct
in
its
very
narrow
assertion
that
merely
because
navigable
water
are
concerned
to
state
laws
of
jurisdiction
and
that's
just
about
as
far
as
they
went,
i
have
ill-advised
my
client
to
the
extent
of
$100,000
in
that
case.
and
in
another
case
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
king
against
the
accident
commission
mentioned
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
309
p.
2d
159.
there
were
five
workmen
drowned
on
elsie
bay,
the
tidewater
and
the
river,
navigable
waters
involved
workmen
out
in
a
--
in
a
boat
who
were
repairing
a
broom,
protecting
logs,
preparatory
to
having
these
logs
moved
up
in
navigable
waters
of
the
elsie
river.
so
there
are
nine
fatals
along
numerous
dependent
children
left
without
fathers.
and
my
interpretation
of
the
davis
case
would
lead
me
to
believe
that
in
both
cases,
they
were
“twilight
zone”
injuries.
both
cases,
i
--
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
know
of
known
personal
knowledge
that
there
was
no
longshore
insurance
provided.
and
certainly,
in
this
broad
scope,
i
think
that
looking
at
the
interest
of
the
workmen
and
as
i
stand
here
now,
actually,
when
i
say
this
i
--
i
am
referring
to
the
liability
in
the
state
of
oregon
and
the
state
fund
for
these
things
but
i
think
that
that
is
a
proper
field
of
activity.
and
you
do
have
the
other
facet
here
too
and
that
is
--
well,
i
have
no
direct
interest
with
mr.
hahn,
i
don't
even
know
the
gentleman.
i
see
in
these
arguments
here
the
question
of
the
standard
of
care
and
--
and
respondent
here
feels
that
the
--
this
employer
should
not
be
subjected
to
a
higher
standard
of
care.
no
injured
workman
can
ever
be
made
whole
again.
we
can't
put
him
back
together
again.
all
you
can
do
is
set
up
a
yardstick
to
measure
damages.
but
certainly,
decision
should
be
geared
and
tempered
so
that
employers
are
required
to
maintain
the
highest
standard
of
care
to
workmen
because
we
may
not
put
mr.
hahn
back
together
again
but
by
insisting
upon
a
high
standard
of
care,
we
may
prevent
some
other
workmen
from
being
injured
and
i
think
that
that
is
--
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
that
is
the
issue
they
raise
that
they
--
to
expose
this
particular
employer
to
this
particular
action
would
incur
to
him
--
require
of
him
a
higher
degree
of
care
and
therefore,
by
some
reason,
upset
the
uniformity
of
the
maritime
jurisdiction
and
do
grave
damage
to
this
litigant.
i
mentioned
it
because
he
has
raised
the
issue
and
i
do
think
that
in
all
of
these
considerations
of
this
nature
in
workmen's
compensation,
that
is
part
of
the
picture.
he
himself
has
deliberately
rejected
state
compensation,
exposed
himself
to
this
damage
action
by
virtue
of
that
voluntary
election
on
his
part.
now,
it
comes
before
this
court
saying,
“i
shouldn't
be
exposed
to
the
higher
degree
of
care
that
i
have
incurred
by
my
own
voluntary
election.”
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
well,
i
am
practical
through
because
i
don't
want
to
impose
on
his
rebuttal.
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
i
don't
believe
so.
and
--
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
--
of
course
the
--
under
the
davis
case,
there,
the
washington
supreme
court
all
the
way
through
the
four
courts
in
washington
had
held
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
anything.
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
this
--
this
court
reversed
all
of
that,
paid
no
attention
to
what
the
washington
court
said,
send
it
back
in
--
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
but
--
mr.
ray
h.
lafky
yes.
he
was
--
let's
say
--
that
is
the
issue
and
of
course,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
my
interest
of
course
is
whether
or
not
in
advising
the
oregon
commission,
we
are
properly
accepting
these
borderline
cases.
of
course,
the
oregon
commission
has
about
40,000
employers,
entertains
about
70,000
claims
a
year
and
rights
not
only
workmen's
compensation
but
by
statute
is
permitted
and
also
this
right
longshore
workmen's
compensation
--
the
longshore
compensation.
but
we
are
interested
and
we
were
quite
concerned
with
the
florida
supreme
court
decision
feeling
that
perhaps
it
was
too
narrow.
it
hasn't
shown
a
complete
disfavor
with
the
davis
doctrine
and
the
fifth
circuit
decision
likewise.
and
i
feel,
as
an
administrator,
having
to
advise
administrators
daily
in
a
performance
and
acceptance
of
claim
70,000
a
year
but
it
is
a
wise
doctrine
to
permit
a
little
more
laxity
in
leeway
of
the
administrative
level
of
where
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
this
type
of
legislation.
