mr.
schwab,
the
longshoremen's
federal
workers
compensation
act
requires
action
on
the
part
of
the
employer
too,
doesn't
it?
doesn't
it
require
that
he'd
call
security?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
misdemeanor
not
to
actually,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
misdemeanor
not
to?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
did
this
--
does
the
record
show
that
this
employer
complied
with
those
provisions
under
the
federal
act?
justice
potter
stewart
either
that
or
your
common
law,
as
i
recollect.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
valid
with
i
believe,
the
necessity
of
his
complying
with
both
acts
if
he
wanted
to
avoid
an
action
against
him
from
which
he
would
be
stripped
of
all
his
defenses,
an
action
against
him
in
a
jury
trial.

stewart
the
oregon
law.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there
is
a
difference,
wasn't
it?
because
here
in
the
twilight
zone,
if
this
is
a
twilight
zone,
as
i'd
say
your
argument
would
necessitate
his
complying
with
his
posting
a
security
under
the
federal
act
and
indicating
his
willingness
to
comply
under
the
state
act
in
order
to
prevent
his
being
subject
to
a
lawsuit
from
a
jury
in
which
all
of
his
defenses
would
be
taken
away
from
him.

the

the

case
affirmed
the
action
of

compensation
to

steel.
justice

what
do
this
employer
could
do?
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
his

justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lafky,
i
don't
want
to
hear
of
course
the
arguments
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
perhaps
your
colleague
would
be
--
would
prefer
to
answer.
question
that
occurs
to
me
is
this.
the
oregon
court
has,
in
fact,
held
that
this
injury
was
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
statute.
now,
would
that
be
res
judicata
in
a
subsequent
--
to
the
benefit
of
the
injured
workman
in
a
subsequent
action
of
the
longshoremen's
act?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
court
said
that
he
reversed
all
those
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
--
that
doesn't
quite
get
my
question,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
perhaps
your
colleague
would
rather
address
himself
to
that
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
that
an
employer
by
voluntarily
paying
compensation
as
--
as
would
be
provided
by
state
law
can
--
he
can't
in
any
way
thereby
protect
himself
from

of
course,
the
jensen
case
wasn't
the
case
where
the
state
law
was
trying
to
take
away
something
from
admiralty,
it
was
this
--
it
was
the
opposite
wasn't
it?
the
jensen
case.
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
case
in
which
the
state
was
trying
to
give
something
that
admiralty
hadn't
given,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
that
the
“twilight
zone”
doctrine
applies
and
applies
only
in
the
--
in
an
--
where
are
the
facts
of
the
accident
make
it
doubtful?
whether
or
not
the
--
the
--
this
was
an
event
over
which
the
state
constitutionally
had
jurisdiction
or
whether
on
the
other
hand,
this
was
something
covered
by
the
federal
longshoreman?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
many
such
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
--
the
ambiguous
facts
of
the
accident,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
if
the
injury
occurred
under
such
circumstance.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
that's
the
result,
but
do
i
understand
you
to
say
or
agree
that
--
that
this
“twilight
zone”
doctrine
applies
only
in
cases
where
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
--
as
to
whether
state
or
federal
jurisdiction
attaches?
justice
potter
stewart
based
on
the
facts
under
which
he
was
injured
or
killed?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
overruling
the
jensen
case
at
this
late
day
in
this
area
or
even
at
the
time
that
davis
was
decided,
overruling
the
jensen
case
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
have
solve
the
problem,
this
particular
problem,
is
that
right?
