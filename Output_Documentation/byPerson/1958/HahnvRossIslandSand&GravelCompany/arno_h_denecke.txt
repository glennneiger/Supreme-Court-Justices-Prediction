mr.
arno
h.
denecke
mr.
--
mr.
justices,
i
feel
compelled
at
the
outset
to
make
some
remarks
which
i
think
would
be
irrelevant
except
for
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
inference
or
the
direct
statement
that
the
defendant
here,
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
did
not
carry
state
workmen's
compensation.
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
oregon
was
as
i
said
on
the
briefs
here
that
the
state
industrial
accident
commission
is
the
only
entity
authorized
by
law
to
provide
workmen's
insurance
as
such
in
oregon.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
here
from
the
chairman's
report
of
the
oregon
state
workmen's
compensation
law
that
there
is
private
workmen's
compensation
in
oregon
and
that
the
chairman's
report
went
on
to
say
that
the
safer
employers
carried
private
workmen's
compensation
instead
of
compensation
with
the
state.
now,
in
our
--
what
i
think
is
rather
peculiar
set
up,
the
state
industrial
accident
fund
is
the
only
official
--
officially
recognized
source
of
workmen's
compensation.
and
any
employer
who
rejects
the
state
act
and
carries
his
own
private
compensation
either
with
private
carriers
or
self
insured,
he
lays
himself
open
to
negligence
suits
or
suits
under
our
oregon
employers'
liability
act.
but
as
the
report
of
the
state
of
oregon
here
points
out,
employers
who
reject
the
state
workmen's
compensation
act
still
continue
to
carry
workmen's
compensation
either
in
private
carriers
or
self
insured.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
that
is
a
part
of
the
record,
your
honor.
and
i
mean
more
than
that,
your
honor,
i
mean
that
the
--
that
company
is
--
and
this
company
although,
this
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor,
but
it
--
the
company
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
pardon?
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
your
honor,
this
company
has
insurance
to
cover
liability
under
a
judgment
also
as
insurance
as
to
other
employers
to
voluntarily
pay
workmen's
compensation
in
accordance
with
the
schedule
of
benefits
of
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
under
--
both
the
state
and
the
federal
act,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
your
honor,
separate
--
i
--
i'm
speaking
now
off
the
record.
there's
nothing
in
the
records,
your
honor,
but
if
i
may,
different
private
coverage
or
it's
the
same
private
coverage
maybe
had
to
cover
liability
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
to
cover
employer's
liability,
to
protect
against
a
suit
such
as
this
and
to
voluntarily
pay
compensation
according
to
the
workmen's
compensation
benefits
as
stated
by
the
state
law.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
he
had
all
of
them,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
not
from
--
not
from
damage
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
--
actions,
your
honor.
no
sir.
but
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
he
does,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
that's
correct,
sir.
and
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
your
honor,
it
is
--
and
i
--
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court
at
all.
it
is
purely
voluntary
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
the
policy
--
and
i
set
out
a
standard
policy
in
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
mr.
justice,
that
that
--
by
that
policy,
the
insurance
company
agrees
to
pay
workmen's
compensation
benefits
to
employees
who
otherwise
would
come
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
he
would
have,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
if
he
had
sought
the
compensation
benefits
payable
according
to
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act,
he
would
have
been
paid
those.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
also,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
oh,
that
is
true,
mr.
justice,
but
in
addition
to
that,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
that
insurance
policy
also
provides
that
the
insurance
carrier
will
pay
mr.
hahn
or
any
other
injured
workman
the
same
benefits
that
that
workman
would
be
paid
by
the
state
industrial
accident
fund
if
the
employer
had
not
rejected
the
oregon
compensation
law.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
it
is
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
there
would
--
may
i
--
i'll
try
to
--
it's
--
i
realize,
it's
a
very
complicated
subject
and
--
but
if
i
may
state
it
this
way
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
certainly,
mr.
justice,
that
in
the
case
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
mr.
hahn,
he
could
--
if
he
had
so
desired,
this
company
would
have
paid
him
compensation,
and
i'm
speaking
the
insurance
company,
mr.
justice
black,
rather
than
the
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
--
employer.
this
insurance
company
would
have
paid
him
the
same
--
the
benefits,
i
--
i
better
put
it,
the
same
benefits
that
are
set
out
in
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
all
he
does
is
--
is
apply
to
the
insurance
carrier.
there
is
no
administrative
tribunal
setup
to
cover
private
insurance
coverage.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
if
--
your
honor,
if
they
cannot
agree,
that
is
the
--
the
employee
and
the
insurance
carrier
cannot
agree,
if
it's
medical
for
example,
it's
a
medical
matter,
the
policies
universally
at
least
commonly
provide
for
an
arbitration.
if
it's
other
questions
of
construction,
the
policy
would
have
to
be
done
by
the
courts,
your
honor
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
if
--
if
for
example
the
physicians
fixes
this
at
--
at
50%
of
the
loss
of
an
arm
for
permanent
tool
disability,
then
the
insurance
carrier
turns
to
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act
and
sees
that
for
50%
loss
of
an
arm,
he
gets
so
much
money.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
yes,
it
would
be,
your
honor.
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
care
for
because
i'm
--
well,
i
haven't
figured
it
out.i
think
it's
quite
obvious
that
he
would
receive
more
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
schedule
benefits
than
he
would
under
the
oregon
schedule
of
benefits.
now,
i
make
that
statement
without
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
under
that
policy,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
and
there
are
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
your
honor,
i
--
it
isn't
--
it
hasn't
been
necessary.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
it
has
been
done
and
i
cited
one
case,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
an
oregon
supreme
court
case,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
in
the
1930s,
your
honor.
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
pardon?
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
but
as
far
as
this
question
is
concerned,
yes,
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor.
and
because
i'm
not
certain
that
i
followed
you
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
he
has
to
reject
it
or
else
he
is
under
time.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
correct.
he
--
in
this
case
he
rejected
it.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
he's
not
insured
with
the
state
industrial
accident
fund,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
on
his
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
on
his
--
on
the
private
contract
of
insurance
that
he
has
procured,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
your
honor,
i
am
unable
to
answer
whether
you
can
sue
the
employer
as
distinguished
from
his
insurance
carrier.
i
am
unable
to
--
to
give
the
court
a
--
an
answer
that
i
have
any
reliance
in
--
at
this
time.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
against
the
insurer,
your
honor?
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
you
could
under
this
type
of
insurance
because
it
has
been
--
it
has
been
construed
and
i
think
even
the
--
the
contract
now
states
that
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
positive
whether
that's
been
by
judicial
construction
or
it's
now
contained
in
the
policy.
at
the
risk
of
laboring
a
point,
i
would
like
to
go
into
this
subject
and
make
one
more
statement
on
it.
in
oregon,
an
employer
who
was
in
a
hazardous
--
hazardous
employment
such
as
this
one,
he
has
two
choices
--
three
choices.
either
he
can
go
under
the
state
fund,
state
insurance
--
under
the
state
fund
and
that's
--
there's
no
actions
possible
against
for
damage
actions,
or
he
can
reject
the
state
act
and
he
doesn't
have
to.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
he
doesn't
have
to
but
as
--
as
the
report
state
here,
they
do
and
did
in
this
case.
he
can
take
out
private
insurance
coverage
which
will
pay
the
injured
employee
according
to
the
benefits
in
the
--
is
set
out
by
the
oregon
compensation
law,
or
if
he's
a
large
employer,
he
can
do
the
same
thing
by
being
a
self
insured.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
primarily
by
lower
rates,
mr.
justice.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
than
the
state
fund,
that's
correct.
if
--
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
he
does
lose
it,
your
honor.
and
--
and
of
course,
many
times,
the
employee
will
prefer
to
bring
a
damage
action
against
the
employer.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
the
case
that
i
was
referring
to,
mr.
justice,
was
one
in
which
the
employee
was
suing
the
insurance
company
for
compensation
benefits.
i
--
as
i
recall,
it
was
the
question
of
whether
they
had
paid
him
all
the
compensation
benefits
that
their
contract
insurance
called
for.
so
that
the
remarks
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
excuse
me.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
that
is
in
essence
what
the
situation
is.
and
of
course
that
is
the
reason
also
why
this
is
somewhat
difficult
for
private
insurance
coverage
to
--
to
stay
in
the
state
there
because
it's
a
--
they're
subject
to
the
verdicts
rather
than
compensation
benefits.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
i
don't
understand
them
to
have
so
assert
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
they
could
--
no,
your
honor,
they
could
not
sue
under
the
compensation
act.
they
sue
on
the
--
on
the
contract
insurance.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that
--
and
that
is
--
that
--
that
he
has
provided
and
employers
generally
do
provide.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
no,
your
honor,
this
is
--
this
is
beyond
the
statute.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
and
as
the
--
as
the
oregon
committee
pointed
out,
mr.
justice,
generally,
the
efficient
employers
as
--
so
far
as
safety
worker
is
concerned
may
withdraw
and
take
the
coverage
under
private
companies.
if
i
may
ask
the
court's
indulgence
to
go
into
the
history
of
this
matter
very
briefly,
i
think
it
may
be
of
some
benefit
in
understanding
the
problem
at
least
as
the
respondent
sees
it.
this
court,
if
i
may
go
back,
the
grant
of
admiralty
power,
and
i
use
power
rather
than
jurisdiction,
is
found
of
course
in
the
--
the
judicial
article
of
the
constitution
regards
to
all
cases
involving
admiralty
and
maritime.
it's
also
found
in
the
grant
of
power
concerning
commerce
between
the
states
and
among
foreign
countries
and
also
among
the
--
the
grant
of
all
other
powers.
now,
it
--
it
was
not
until
southern
pacific
versus
jensen
in
1917
that
the
conflict
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
came
to
focus
on
this
particular
point.
and
looking
at
jensen
just
a
moment,
not
in
regard
to
compensation
laws
but
generally,
the
two
dissenting
justices
are
the
two
justices
that
wrote
the
dissents
in
the
jensen
case,
those
were
justices
holmes
and
--
and
mr.
justice
pitney,
both
were
the
opinion
in
1917
that
in
state
courts,
the
state
was
free
to
apply
state
laws
and
did
not
have
to
apply
any
admiralty
laws
if
--
even
if
the
event
happened
on
navigable
waters.
the
majority
in
that
case
held,
and
again,
i'm
leading
out
compensation
laws,
the
majority
in
that
case
held
that
anything
concerning
navigable
water,
anything
concerning
maritime
that
there
--
the
federal
government
was
supreme
in
that
regard
and
that
because
of
this
supremacy,
the
state
workmen's
compensation
law
of
new
york
could
not
apply.
now,
the
jensen
decision,
as
the
members
of
this
court
are
so
well
aware,
has
certainly
been
blunted.
however,
this
court
repeatedly
reiterates
in
its
decisions
the
fact
that
in
matters
of
maritime,
the
federal
government
is
supreme
and
state
law
cannot
be
applied.
now,
as
the
court
so
well
knows,
this
matter
was
wilt
at
the
way
after
southern
pacific
versus
jensen.
and
courts,
this
court
as
well
as
other
courts
held
that
even
though
it
did
occur
on
navigable
waters,
in
the
particular
instance
of
workmen's
compensation
that
the
federal
government
was
not
necessarily
supreme
simply
because
the
injury
or
death
happened
to
occur
on
navigable
waters.
and
then
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
was
passed
which
of
course
gave
the
--
or
was
a
federal
statute
covering
injuries
on
navigable
waters.
even
after
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act,
this
court
as
well
as
other
courts
said,
“well,
even
though
it
happened
on
navigable
waters,
still
for
various
reasons,
state
compensation
acts
could
apply."
then,
because
an
injured
workman,
it
was
getting
impossible
to
tell
where
his
remedy
was.was
it
in
the
state
or
was
it
federal?the
same
thing
was
true
of
employers.
so,
this
court
in
the
davis
case
in
1942,
in
an
effort
to
solve
this
problem
of
which
compensation
act
applied,
solve
it
for
the
employees
benefit
and
for
the
employers
benefit
instead
of
leaving
the
line
as
congress
drew
it
under
the
--
drew
it
under
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
set
up
a
zone.and
said
in
this
zone,
either
state
workmen's
compensation
or
federal
workmen's
compensation
is
possible.
now,
the
court,
i
don't
think,
attempted
to
say
that
that
was
a
legally
logical
answer
but
it
did
point
out
that
it
did
solve
a
very
definite
problem
in
supplying
compensation
benefits
to
employees
and
at
the
same
time
giving
some
benefit
to
their
employers.
now,
if
the
respondent
understands
the
davis
case,
the
thread
that
the
respondent
sees
in
that
case
is
if
the
only
act
which
would
bring
this
under
maritime
and
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
the
fact
that
it
happened
on
navigable
waters,
if
that's
the
only
thing,
then
there's
nothing
wrong
with
defying
state
workmen's
compensation
acts.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
is
something
else
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
happened
on
navigable
waters,
if
there
is
something
else,
then
the
davis
case
cannot
apply.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
i
think
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
i
think,
your
honor,
if
i
may
go
into
another
line
of
cases
which
--
along
this
same
point,
i
--
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
answer,
mr.
justice.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
but
i
--
i've
gotten
this
--
i
thought
i
got
this
guidance
from
some
other
cases
of
the
court.
this
court
has
held
in
other
cases
where
an
injury
occurred
on
--
on
navigable
waters.
this
court
has
held
the
fact
that
it
occurred
upon
navigable
waters
alone
made
it
a
maritime
tort.
and
this
court
has
said,
if
it's
a
maritime
tort,
there
is
federal
supremacy
and
the
court
cannot
change
the
federal
law
in
this
regard.
now,
i'm
referring
particularly
to
three
cases
of
the
court
which
i
think
have
been
within
the
last
six,
seven,
eight
years.
the
first
case
in
point
of
time
was
the
garrett
case,
now,
that
was
a
seaman's
case,
true,
but
the
question
there
was
what
--
was
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
in
proving
the
validity
of
a
seaman's
--
of
a
release
taken
from
a
seaman?
now,
the
court
in
that
case
said,
“this
happened
on
navigable
waters,
also,
of
course,
it
was
brought
under
the
jones
act.”
but
the
court
stressed
the
fact
that
this
was
a
maritime
matter
and
therefore,
the
state
law,
on
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
release,
could
not
apply
that
it
was
necessary
to
apply
the
maritime
law,
that
applied
customarily
in
seaman's
case
that
the
employer
had
the
burden
of
proof
of
proving
that
this
release
was
taken
free
from
any
fraud.
then
i
think
a
more
important
case
on
this
subject,
more
important
than
this
particular
regard
not
because
of
the
nature
of
the
case
was
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn.
now,
in
that
case,
a
carpenter
was
onboard
the
ship,
went
onboard
the
ship
to
make
some
repairs.
now,
the
ship
was
in
pennsylvania,
in
--
in
a
harbor
in
pennsylvania,
and
the
carpenter
was
injured
by
something
alledgedly
wrong
with
the
ship
and
he
sued
the
ship.
now,
this
was
not
a
jones
act
case,
he
was
a
--
a
ship
repair
man
and
was
suing
a
ship
for
a
--
i'll
call
it
a
maritime
tort.
he
brought
the
suit
in
the
law
side
of
the
federal
court
or
perhaps
it
was
removed
to
the
federal
court.
in
any
event,
it
was
on
the
law
side
in
the
federal
court.
this
--
and
the
question
before
this
court,
one
of
the
questions
was,
“will
the
pennsylvania
law
of
contributory
negligence
apply
which
would
bar
mr.
hahn
or
will
the
general
admiralty
law
of
--
contributory
negligence
is
merely
a
mitigation,
will
that
apply?”
well,
this
court
held
an
unmistakable
language
that
if
the
tort
occurs
on
navigable
waters,
it's
a
maritime
tort
and
the
state
law
can
have
no
application.
it
must
be
federal
law.
then
this
court
in
the
last
term,
i
believe
it
was
in
the
mcallister
case,
when
the
question
was
when
a
seaman
sued
for
both
unseaworthiness
and
under
the
jones
act
and
the
question
was,
would
the
state
statute
of
limitations
on
unseaworthiness,
would
it
apply?
if
it
did,
the
plaintiff
would
have
been
barred
because
it
was
brought
after
the
two
years,
which
i
think
was
the
texas
statute.
this
court
again
held
that
this
having
occurred
on
water
was
a
maritime
tort
and
the
state
law
could
have
no
application.
now,
it
appears
to
us,
and
this,
mr.
justice
black,
is
an
attempt
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
--
somewhat.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
no,
your
honor,
the
--
the
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn
stated
that
the
state
law
could
supplement.
i
believe
that
was
the
--
the
word
that
the
court
used.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
no,
i
don't
believe
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
that's
correct.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
the
case
did
not
go
that
far.
your
honor
used
the
--
the
language
there
and
i
--
i
can't
put
my
--
in
a
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
mr.
justice.
if
i
may
presume
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
--
that
same
line,
i
think
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
if,
and
i
have
tried
to
think
of
some
difficulties
which
would
arise
if
this
court
would
pronounce
that
the
--
that
this
would
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
and
i
obviously
was
not
able
to
think
of
all
of
them
but
some
--
some
of
the
difficulties,
and
when
i
say
difficulties,
they
are
definitely
difficulties
of
legal
logic
here.
for
example,
this
same
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act,
if
we
can
use
it
and
it's
not
quite
as
--
well,
assuming
that
in
this
same
body
of
water
here,
there
was
a
general
contractor
and
a
subcontractor,
both
not
rejecting
the
act
but
contributing
to
the
state
fund
and
those
--
and
a
workman
was
injured
on
premises
that
were
jointly
controlled
by
this
general
contractor
and
the
subcontractor,
and
it
is
happened
on
--
injury
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
now,
if
oregon
law
is
going
to
be
applied,
when
this
injured
workman
who's
employed
by
the
subcontractor
sues
the
general
contractor,
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
law
says
he
can't
bring
a
suit
because
it
has
a
provision
in
there
that
employees
on
premises
under
the
joint
supervision
control
of
two
different
employers,
both
of
them
have
paid
into
the
act,
why,
then
the
suit
is
not
maintainable
under
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act.
so,
the
question
then
if
such
a
matter
should
ever
raise
this
court
would
be,
can
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
law
be
applied
in
one
case?
and
in
this
particular
case,
which
i
attempted
to
set
up,
the
hypothetical
would
not
be
applied.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
i
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
did
think
it
was
of
some
importance
to
show
the
difficulties
that
may
occur,
one
other
possibility
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
i
--
i
understand,
your
honor,
yes,
the
logical
difficulty.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
if
i
may
follow
that
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
--
thesis,
mr.
justice,
the
davis
--
in
the
davis
case,
it
was
pointed
out
by,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
choice
there
was
between
no
remedy
or
a
remedy
of
suing
as
an
employer
who
had
failed
to
subscribed
to
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
or
washington
workmen's
compensation.
so
that
in
there,
it
may
have
been
that
a
contrary
decision
would
have
meant
that
this
widow
would
never
have
received
anything,
compensation
or
otherwise.
now,
in
this
particular
instance,
there
is
no
question
but
that
mr.
hahn,
at
the
time
of
his
injury
and
now
--
and
for
one
year
after
the
termination
of
this
lawsuit,
in
the
event
that
the
court
affirms
the
oregon
court
will
be
eligible
to
receive
compensation
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
he
has
a
--
he
has
compensation
and
he
always
could
have
had
compensation.
but
relying
upon
the
davis
case
now,
he
has
chosen
to
gamble
and
attempt
to
get
a
jury
verdict
which
would
substantially
exceed
the
compensation
which
have
him
under
the
--
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
and
--
and
i
realized
that
this
is
completely
extra
judicial
here
but
i
--
there's
never
been
any
question
raised
and
--
but
his
eligibility
for
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
but
if
i
--
if
the
court
needs
any
assurance
that
this
--
and
--
that
this
man
is
going
to
receive
that
this
court
affirms
the
oregon
court
going
to
receive
compensation
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
and
as
the
--
as
i'm
sure
the
court
knows
the
--
that
compensation,
he
doesn't
even
have
to
make
a
claim
for
it
until
one
year
after
this
litigation
is
terminated.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
didn't
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
i
would
think
it
would
be
res
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
it's
between
parties
and
--
and
privilege
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
your
honor,
even
though
i
don't
think
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act,
ross
island
would
be
a
party.
certainly,
the
insurance
company
is
a
privity
of
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
think
that
they
would
be
bound.
i
would
think
that
we
would
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
may
i
--
may
i
go
this
that
we
would
be
estopped,
and
i'm
using
that
in
a
rather
loose
sense,
or
barred
from
urging
that
the
waters
were
not
navigable.
i
suppose
that
the
deputy
commissioner
administering
the
longshore
act
would
still,
if
he
so
desired,
could
--
could
hear
testimony
on
it.
now,
i'm
--
i'm
not
certain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
i'm
not
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
your
honor,
carrying
one
step
further,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice,
suppose
if
the
deputy
commissioner
administering
the
act
found
that
the
waters
were
not
navigable
and
then
the
matter
were
appealed
from
that
decision
to
the
appropriate
federal
district
court,
i
would
think
there
that
the
matter
would
be
res
judicata
even
if
it
were
not
before
the
deputy
commissioner.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
i
think
that
would
be
possible,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
i
--
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
any
question
here
and
i'm
--
this
a
little
side,
mr.
justice
brennan,
from
your
question,
but
i
don't
see,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
how
this
could
be
anything
but
navigable
because
it
was,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
navigated
and
as
far
as
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
this
area
connected
up
with
the
columbia
river
which
connects
with
other
states
and
which
connects
with
foreign
countries.
so,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
see
how
it
would
be
possible
to
hold
other
than
these
were
navigable
waters
in
the
united
states.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
mr.
justice,
as
i
understand
the
situation
and
i
think
i
do
on
this
particular
point
here,
the
deputy
commissioner
will
never,
in
the
even
this
court
affirms
the
oregon
court,
this
--
the
deputy
commissioner
will
never
see
this
case
simply
because
as
the
--
the
act
is
itself
goes
into
effect
automatically.
we
pay,
we,
the
insurance
payer
here,
pays
mr.
hahn.
and
the
deputy
commissioner
in
this
case
and
in
all
other
cases
does
not
see
the
case
unless
either
insurance
carrier
controverts
the
thing
the
compensation
or
either
the
employee
or
the
insurance
carrier
disagree
about
the
amount
of
and
time
of
compensation.
so,
the
--
if
it
is
of
any
assistance,
i
can
give
my
personal
assurance
that
the
compensation
would
be
paid
and
i
--
and
i
don't
--
that
has
never
been
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
the
cause
of
this
proceeding,
your
honor?
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
your
honor,
i
would
think
we
would
be
bound
to
make
such
a
claim.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
mr.
justice,
in
a
case
such
as
ours
here,
it
is
not
a
dilemma
because
the
employee
from
the
very
beginning
in
a
case
such
as
ours
can
receive
compensation
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
if
--
if
he
has
a
dilemma
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
well,
then,
your
honor,
he
would
--
he
would
have
to
take
this
up
with
the
deputy
commissioner,
and
the
deputy
commissioner
of
course
and
among
his
award
if
he
found
that
the
employer
and
the
insurance
carrier
was
wrong,
why,
then,
he
would
award
a
payment
of
at
least
a
part
of
the
cost.
and
i'm
not
saying,
mr.
justice,
that
it
completely
compensates
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
it's
not
if
the
insurance
carrier
controverts
that
--
that
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
no,
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
arno
h.
denecke
--
to
mislead
the
court.
one
other
feature
which
i
would
like
to
dwell
very
briefly
on,
two
other
features,
if
i
may,
first
of
all,
as
it
been
brought
up
in
the
argument
here,
one
of
our
contentions
is
that
if
the
petitioner
were
allowed
to
prevail
in
this
suit,
he
is
doing
it
at
least
partially
on
the
basis
of
the
oregon
employer's
liability
act
and
the
oregon
employer's
liability
act
imposes
a
standard,
in
fact
is
very
different
than
the
admiralty
law
employed
in
the
ordinary
maritime
tort.
now,
there
are
several
difficult
--
differences
and
the
--
both
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
oregon
federal
district
court
have
held
that
suits
under
the
oregon
employer's
liability
act
may
not
be
maintained
when
it
is
for
a
maritime
tort.
one
of
the
differences,
and
as
i
said
there
are
several,
one
is
that
the
oregon
employer's
liability
act
imposes
the
standard
of
that
the
employer
must
use
every
device,
care
and
precaution
and
then
it
has
some
--
some
additions
on
to
that.but
it
is
our
belief
based
upon
these
and
other
judicial
decisions
of
inferior
courts
that
the
application,
the
oregon
employer's
liability
act
would
not
be
permitted
in
the
maritime
tort
simply
because
it
would
do
as
this
court
has
said
in
other
kinds
of
cases
involved
in
maritime
torts
destroy
the
uniformity
if
necessary.
thank
you.
