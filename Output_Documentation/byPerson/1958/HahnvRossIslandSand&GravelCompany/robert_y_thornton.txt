mr.
robert
y.
thornton
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wanted
to
just
mention
briefly
mr.
denecke's
argument
concerning
a
suppose
conflict
between
this
case
and
the
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn,
garrett
versus
moore-mccormack
and
the
mcallister
case.
now,
those
cases
are
all
cases
where
state
law
attempted
to
take
away
admiralty
rights.
in
this
case,
no
one
is
trying
to
deprive
anyone
of
anything.
state
law
here
isn't
trying
to
take
away
any
admiralty
rights
and
all
the
court
said
in
those
cases,
as
i
understand
it
is
that
where
state
law
conflicts
with
established
admiralty
rights
or
attempts
to
deprive
a
person
of
those
rights
that
the
federal
law
prevails.
now,
obviously,
there
is
no
conflict
here
because
in
the
--
the
garrett
case
and
the
davis
case
were
both
decided
the
same
day,
and
the
opinions
were
written
by
the
same
justice.
and
the
davis
case
merely
holds
that
where
you
have
the
“twilight
zone”
of
course
and
you
could
--
you
can
go
either
way,
you
can
either
go
for
a
federal
or
a
state
remedy.
so
obviously,
there's
no
conflict.
now
--
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
the
jensen
case
was
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
that's
right.
and
of
course,
that
was
a
workmen's
compensation
law
--
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
--
which
this
court
has
now
decided
can
be
applied
by
a
state
--
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
--
in
the
“twilight
zone”.
so,
actually,
the
--
the
jensen
case,
the
old
basis
of
it
is
--
is
gone,
you
might
say,
because
those
cases
can
be
[laughs]
--
those
can
be
applied
now.
however,
you
want
to
look
at
the
--
the
whole
basis
of
the
jensen
case
which
is
a
workmen's
compensation
decision
is
--
is
now
been
wiped
away.
mr.
denecke
mentioned
in
his
argument
here,
this
private
insurance,
and
i
think
it
caused
some
confusion
with
the
court
and
--
and
i
want
clear
it
up
as
much
as
i
can,
this
private
insurance,
there's
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
whatsoever.
the
record
is
completely
silent
about
it,
and
it
wasn't
mentioned
until
we
got
into
this
court.
we
went
through
the
trial
court,
we
went
through
the
state
supreme
court
and
finally
when
we
got
into
this
court,
this
private
insurance
was
brought
up
by
mr.
denecke.
i
think
in
--
in
answer
to
our
contention
that
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company
should
be
--
should
be
held
responsible
in
this
case
under
the
--
under
the
oregon
act
because
it
would
hurt
the
enforcement
of
workmen's
compensation
laws
if
they
were
not
held.
so
for
the
first
time
it
was
brought
up
in
this
court
and
they
want
this
court
to
understand
that
they
have
a
private
policy
of
so-called
workmen's
compensation
insurance.
now,
as
i
say
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
it
whatsoever.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
it
that
mr.
hahn
even
knew
about
it
or
there
was
never
offered
to
him.
and
they
set
out
in
their
brief
a
policy
of
workmen's
--
a
private
policy
of
insurance,
and
i
think
the
inference
is
or
they
want
this
court
to
understand
that
that
is
their
policy.
now,
this
is
completely
outside
the
record.
normally,
i
wouldn't
mention
it
except
the
court
here
seemed
to
be
interested
in
it
and
i
did
point
out
in
the
brief,
in
our
reply
brief
starting
at
page
10,
to
the
end
of
the
brief,
how
this
private
so-called
policy
of
insurance
is
nothing
like
workmen's
compensation
at
all.
to
begin
with,
it
has
no
standing
under
the
law
whatsoever.
and
if
the
employer
rejects
the
compensation
act,
they
are
held
responsible
under
the
law
of
negligence
whether
they
have
one
of
these
policies
or
not.
it's
a
voluntary
act
on
their
part.
now,
the
quality
of
this
insurance,
this
so-called
compensation
insurance
is
well
illustrated
by
paragraph
16
of
that
insurance
which
provides
that
a
simple
agreement
between
the
insurer
and
the
employer
will
cut
the
injured
employee
off
without
one
cent.
in
other
words,
all
the
--
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
the
insurer
and
the
employer
agrees
that
this
fellow
gets
nothing
and
he
gets
nothing.
now,
what
a
--
what
a
whip
to
require
an
employee
to
take
a
smaller
inadequate
award
in
a
situation
like
that,
all
they
have
to
do
is
agree
he'll
get
nothing
and
he
has
no
rights.
i
think
that
answers
the
questions
of
one
of
the
justices
asked
as
to
whether
an
action
of
law
can
be
maintained
against
the
insurer
or
the
employer
under
one
of
these
policies.
furthermore,
in
order
for
the
employee
to
get
any
rights
at
all,
he
must
give
a
full
release.
in
other
words,
he
has
to
sign
a
release
to
the
insurance
company
before
he's
paid
anything,
that's
provision
number
14
(e)
of
this
policy.
now,
if
he
asked
to
sign
a
release
before
he
gets
any
benefits
or
before
he
is
in
entitled
to
anything,
how
can
he
bring
an
action
under
the
policy?
obviously,
he
can't.
the
policy
provides
that
it
can
be
canceled
by
the
insurer
or
the
employer
anytime
on
10
days
notice.
of
course,
in
workmen's
compensation,
under
the
workmen's
compensation
law,
he's
entitled
to
it
at
all
times
and
even
if
the
employer
has
not
complied
with
the
act
by
putting
--
paying
the
premiums.
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
he
cannot
sue
under
the
policy
unless
he
first
executes
a
release.
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
oh,
yes,
if
he
executes
a
full
release
to
the
--
to
the
insurer,
then
he
can
bring
an
action
--
no
he
can't
even
then,
your
honor,
no
he
can't
even
then.
he
doesn't
get
any
workmen's
compensation
benefits
unless
he
executes
the
release
and
no
action
can
be
brought
under
the
policy
at
all.
does
the
policy
provides
that
if
there's
any
dispute,
there
should
be
arbitration
and
he
has
to
pay
half
the
cost
of
the
arbitration
and
the
policy
provides
nothing
for
aggravation.
and
under
the
oregon
law,
he
has
two
years
if
there's
aggravation
to
bring
an
action
for
aggravation
to
get
a
jury
trial.
this
type
of
a
policy
was
discussed
in
the
case
of
whitehead
versus
montgomery
ward,
194
or.
106
at
page
130.
in
which
the
oregon
court
unfavorably
compared
with
the
provisions
of
one
of
these
policies
with
the
oregon
compensation
act.
that
case
significantly
was
not
cited
by
the
respondent.
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
194
or.
130,
your
honor,
it's
cited
at
page
14
of
our
reply
brief.
another
example
is
case
of
pease
versus
roseburg
lumber
company
which
is
206
oregon,
cited
in
our
brief
here,
206
or.
56
--
658,
which
there
was
a
policy
for
only
$5000.
now,
mr.
lafky
here
is
telling
about
some
of
these
cases
that
was
for
one
accident.
it's
--
i
mean
for
one
entire
incident.
mr.
lafky
was
talking
about
cases
where
they
incurred
liability
of
$100,000
on
one
accident.
this
policy
in
the
roseburg
lumber
company
case
would
be
totally
inadequate
in
a
situation
like
that.
the
policy
they
set
out
here
in
the
brief
is
$50,000
and
$100,000.
in
other
words,
50
for
one
person,
100
for
one
accident.
you
have
a
--
you
have
a
catastrophe.
it
wouldn't
begin
to
cover
the
injuries
and
liability.
now,
respondent's
attorney
states
in
argument
here
that
hahn
can
get
longshore
benefits.
i
think
this
court
recognized
when
it
set
up
the
“twilight
zone”
doctrine
that
which
ever
way
one
of
these
employees
went
that
is
the
way
that
he
was
part.
if
there's
--
there's
no
assurance
in
this
case,
mr.
denecke
says
he
hasn't
give
the
personal
assurance
now
that
this
will
be
paid.
but
whichever
way
this
employee
had
--
had
done,
there's
no
assurance
that
they
wouldn't
have
said,
“he
should
have
gone
the
other
way.”
that's
the
reason
for
the
“twilight
zone”.
now,
the
question
isn't
--
isn't
in
this
case
which
would
be
the
best
remedy
for
mr.
hahn
to
have.
the
question
in
this
case
is,
can
the
state
of
oregon
constitutionally
apply
its
laws
in
the
“twilight
zone”
in
this
situation?
that's
the
question
for
this
court
to
decide.
and
unless
it's
unconstitutional,
under
the
united
states
constitution
for
oregon
to
apply
its
laws,
then
mr.
hahn
is
entitled
to
recover.
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
as
i
understand
it,
yes.
this
court
was
--
took
notice
of
all
of
the
cases
that
--
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
--
were
being
--
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
--
that
were
being
fought,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
and
this
court
finally
said,
“this
has
got
to
stop,
just
trying
to
draw
a
sharp
line
of
distinction
between
every
case.
it's
not
necessarily
under
the
constitution.
so,
we're
going
to
set
up
the
“twilight
zone”
where
there
is
an
area
of
doubt
as
to
which
law
this
man
could
come
under.”
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
because
if
the
--
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
because
of
the
ambiguous
facts
of
the
accident
also
because
of
the
ambiguous
questions
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
constitutional,
whether
it
would
interfere
with
the
uniformity
of
maritime
to
apply
state
law
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
yes,
in
the
area
of
doubt
where
--
where
its
questions,
as
to
which
--
which
remedy
a
--
a
man
should
have
where
the
--
where
the
man
could
go
conceivably
either
way.
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case
under
which
he
was
injured.
and
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
--
it's
a
question
of
whether
federal
law
or
state
law
will
apply
in
that
situation
rather
than
to
try
to
draw
a
sharp
line
of
distinction.
you
allow
the
--
if
a
man
chooses
federal
law,
that's
fine.
if
he
chooses
state
law,
that's
fine.
as
justice
frankfurter
said,
it
may
be
illogical
as
a
constitutional
doctrine
but
that
is
--
that
is
the
only
sensual
way
to
solve
this
thing
unless
the
court
should
decide
to
--
to
put
the
jensen
case
out
which
this
court
--
the
court
decided
not
to
do.
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
well,
i
think
that's
what
mr.
chief
justice
stone
want
to
do
in
that
davis
case.
he
--
he
wanted
to
just
get
rid
of
the
jensen
case
altogether,
but
this
court,
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
y.
thornton
and
acted
in
reliance
on
it.
and
so
rather
than
take
such
drastic
action,
it
was
better
to
set
up
this
“twilight
zone”
where
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
--
as
to
mr.
justice
black
points
out
as
to
--
as
to
just
what
congress
meant
or
just
which
remedy
was
proper.
thank
you.
