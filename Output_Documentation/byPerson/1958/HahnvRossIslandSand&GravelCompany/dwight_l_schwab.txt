mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
may
it
please
the
justices
of
this
honorable
court.
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court
here
involves
the
following.
an
employer
ex
parte
rejects
a
state
workmen's
compensation
act.
his
twilight
zone
employee
is
injured
by
reason
of
his
employer's
negligence.
now,
the
employee
would
have
been
entitled
to
workmen's
compensation,
but
for
the
rejection
of
the
compensation
act.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
the
compensation
act
grants
to
the
employee
a
substitute
remedy
under
these
circumstances
where
the
act
had
been
rejected.
now,
the
question
is,
is
the
employee
prevented
by
the
united
states
constitution
from
exercising
that
substitute
remedy?
the
oregon
supreme
court
says,
“yes.
an
employee
in
circumstances
like
that
has
no
state
remedy
whatsoever.”
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff,
harry
hahn
worked
for
the
defendant,
respondent,
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company.
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company
incidentally
is
an
oregon
corporation
which
operates
in
the
portland
area,
dredging
up
sand
and
gravel
and
selling
it
in
the
portland
area
for
commercial
purposes.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
hurt
on
march
23rd,
1955.
prior
to
the
injury
of
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
ross
island
had
rejected
the
state
workmen's
compensation
act.
now,
in
oregon,
the
state
act
is
elected
and
--
however,
where
a
hazardous
occupation
is
involved,
which
this
was,
the
employer
automatically
comes
under
the
act
until
he
rejects
it,
but
he
may
reject
it
at
anytime
by
a
very
simple
method
of
writing
a
letter
to
the
commission
saying,
“i
reject
the
act.”
now,
in
the
event
the
employer
of
this
kind
does
reject
the
act,
he
is
subject,
in
the
event,
a
workman
is
injured
to
an
action
for
negligence
with
the
common
defenses
of
a
fellow
servant,
assumption
of
risk,
contribute
--
contributory
negligence
removed.
i
think
this
is
rather
common
in
all
of
the
elective
acts
and
there
are
about
25
elective
acts
in
the
united
states.
he
also,
in
oregon
in
addition,
the
employer
who
rejects
is
also
subject
to
an
action
pursuant
to
the
employers'
liability
act,
the
oregon
employers'
liability
act.
now,
both
of
these
sanctions
against
the
rejecting
employer
are
provided
for
by
the
workmen's
compensation
act
itself.
in
other
words,
the
--
instead
of
the
act,
you
can
say,
“if
you
don't
comply
with
it,
you
will
as
a
rejecting
employer
be
subject
to
the
following
actions
in
the
case
you
are
negligent.”
now
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
i
think
it's
one
or
--
either
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
that's
the
basis
of
this
action.
it's
a
negligence
action
based
on
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act,
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
set
out
on
page
two
of
the
record
and
the
employee
in
this
case
alleged
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employer
and
he
also
alleged
violation
of
the
employers'
liability
act.
the
case
was
--
was
filed
in
the
oregon
circuit
court,
which
is
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
the
employer
in
this
case
answered
by
alleging
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers
act
was
the
exclusive
remedy
of
this
employee.
and
of
course,
we
denied
that.
it
was
tried
to
a
jury
and
there
was
jury
verdict
in
the
amount
of
$38,242
plus
cost
and
judgment
was
entered
on
that
verdict.
the
employer
then
moved
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
on
the
grounds
that
the
longshoremen
act
was
the
exclusive
remedy.
the
trial
court
granted
that
motion
and
the
judgment
was
set
aside
on
the
exclusive
grounds
that
the
longshoremen
act
was
the
exclusive
remedy
of
this
employee.
we
appeal
this
to
the
oregon
supreme
court,
which
affirmed
on
the
ground,
as
far
as
i
can
get
it
from
the
courts
of
opinion.
one,
the
congress
had
preempted
this
field.
and
two,
although
the
oregon
supreme
court
recognized
the
twilight
zone
as
being
in
existence,
they
held
that
under
the
twilight
zone,
you
could
only
recover
pure
--
100%
pure
compensation
and
nothing
else,
just
merely
workmen's
compensation
payments.
we
petitioned
for
rehearing
and
that
was
denied.
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
this
court
which
was
granted
june
2.
now,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows
and
i
think
they're
important.
i'll
go
into
some
detail
on
them.
our
contention
is
that
harry
hahn,
the
plaintiff
here
was
a
twilight
zone
employee
and
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
merely
of
basic
elementary
negligence.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
is
this.
that
there
are
still
some
contention
in
this
case
that
the
oregon
employers'
liability
act
places
some
sort
of
burden
on
uniform
view
of
maritime
law.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
right
at
the
beginning
that
this
employer
was
guilty
of
the
most
basic
elementary
negligence
as
the
record
shows
from
the
undisputed
evidence.
now,
concerning
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company,
as
i
say
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company
was
in
the
sand
and
gravel
business.
they've
been
dredging
up
sand
and
gravel
for
years
and
selling
it
commercially
in
the
portland
area.
if,
your
honors,
would
care
turn
to
page
85
of
the
transcript
of
record,
i
think
it
might
possibly
help
in
the
understanding
of
the
facts
here.
there
is
a
--
an
exhibit
set
out,
exhibit
number
4
--
displays
exhibit
number
4.
now,
in
the
middle
of
--
of
exhibit
number
4,
you'll
notice
the
river
there,
that's
the
willamette
river.
this
in
the
heart
of
portland,
oregon.
you
see
the
island
there,
on
one
part
of
it,
it
says
ross.
well,
this
all
ross
island,
including
this
whole
horseshoe.
down
below,
it
says
hardtack,
but
actually
it's
all
part
of
ross
island,
part
of
it
--
it's
all
ross
island,
part
of
it
is
sometimes
called
hardtack
island.
now,
inside
of
ross
island,
you'll
notice
a
lagoon
and
that's
where
this
action
all
took
place.
where
you
see
the
x
mark
in
the
lagoon,
that
is
the
spot
where
the
plaintiff,
hahn,
did
his
regular
work.
that's
where
they
were
dredging.
at
the
place
where
you
see
the
circle,
the
zero
of
the
eight
circle,
that
is
the
spot
where
hahn
is
injured.
now,
that
circle
there
is
right
next
to
what
was
know
as
the
rock
pressure.
that's
where
all
the
sand
and
gravel
was
taken.
when
it
was
dredged
up
out
of
the
lagoon,
it
was
put
through
the
rock
pressure
and
then
it
was
belted.
there
was
a
--
some
of
these
belts,
the
tramways
that
took
all
of
the
sand
and
gravel
over
to
the
mainland,
which
you'll
notice
off
to
the
right.
now,
the
defendant,
ross
island
owns
all
of
ross
island,
including
that
lagoon
area,
including
everything
under
the
lagoon.
they
own
it
in
fee
simple.
it
was
patented
by
the
united
states
government
in
1873
and
deeded
the
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company
in
1926.
if,
your
honors,
will
notice
that
the
--
as
far
as
exhibit
1
is
concerned
on
page
83,
there
--
it
shows
ross
island
there
with
a
red
circle
around
it.
it
stipulated
that
all
of
that
area,
including
the
lagoon
was
owned
by
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company.
you'll
notice
that
the
lagoon
itself
is
cul-de-sac.
in
other
words,
you
can
only
get
in
on
the
north
end
and
there
was
no
other
way
to
get
in
or
out.
now,
all
of
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company's
product
came
from
the
lagoon.
it
was
put
on
a
barge
where
it
was
dredged
up.
it
was
taken
over
a
short
distance
to
the
rock
pressure,
which
you'll
note
there
in
the
lagoon
on
exhibit
4
and
then
there
was
a
conveyor
belt
where
it
was
taken
up
to
shore.
they've
done
a
lot
of
digging
there.
they've
completely
altered
ross
island.
if
the
court
cares
to
compare
exhibit
d
which
appears
on
101
of
the
record
with
exhibit
4,
the
court
will
notice
the
alterations
that
have
been
made
in
there
by
ross
island
sand
&
gravel
company.
originally,
in
1895,
exhibit
d
shows
that
the
depths
in
the
lagoon
area
were
some
eight
or
nine
feet.
record
shows
that
some
depths
in
the
lagoon
is
now
over
a
100
feet.
now,
the
defendant
operates
this
lagoon
as
it
pleases.
it
has
complete
jurisdiction
over
the
lagoon.
it
takes
no
orders
from
anyone.
there
are
hundreds
of
piling
driven
throughout
the
lagoon,
cement
tiers
and
anchors.
they
have
erected
towers
for
this
tramway
to
take
their
product
to
the
mainland.
if
the
court
cares
to
have
a
close
up
of
those
towers,
exhibit
10
on
page
87
or
exhibit
89
--
exhibit
25
on
page
89
will
give
the
court
an
idea
of
how
they
have
built
these
towers
right
out
in
the
middle
of
the
only
entrance
to
the
lagoon.
they've
built
the
pressure
plant
which
is
very
large
in
the
lagoon.
they've
put
hundreds
of
pilings
under
that
pressure
plant.
they
rent
space
in
the
lagoon
regularly
to
log
graph.
any
of
this
exhibits
here,
you'll
notice
all
log
graph
in
the
lagoon
and
that's
a
very
profitable
business.
they
--
they
rent
so
much
space
in
the
lagoon
at
times
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
do
anything
else
in
the
lagoon,
to
move
around
in
there
to
--
even
to
conduct
their
dredging
operations.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
the
trust
of
it
is
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
--
your
honor
--
your
honor,
it
is
this.
we
say
that
the
twilight
zone
case.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
yes,
there
is.
if
there
were
none,
i
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
the
--
the
defendant
testified
at
the
trial
--
the
testimony
showed
at
the
trial
that
if
anyone
attempted
to
come
in
to
this
lagoon
with
the
log
graph
and
refused
to
pay
the
going
rental
rates
that
they've
established
that
they
would
eject
them
and
throw
them
out
of
the
lagoon.
the
united
states
government
has
established
harbor
lines
clear
around
this
island
and
kept
out
the
entire
lagoon.
in
other
words,
they
have
--
that
is
outside
of
the
harbor
lines,
which
would
have
--
which
had
been
established
in
the
willamette
river.
the
defendant
dredges
the
sand
and
gravel
with
no
permits
from
any
governmental
authority
and
pays
no
royalties
to
anyone.
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
company
could
not
completely
block
off
this
lagoon
by
building
a
dam
or
chaining
it
off
of
blocking
it
off
to
anyone
else
coming
here.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
making
that
argument.
i
have
attempted
to
in
the
past,
but
i
--
i'm
not
making
that
contention.
i'm
not
admitting
that
these
are
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
i'm
merely
trying
to
show
that
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
they
are,
that
they
are
grave
technically
so
and
not
navigable
waters
of
the
unites
states
that
the
longshore
act
was
talking
about
or
that
the
united
states
--
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
the
jensen
case
in
particular.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said
they
were
navigable
waters.
i'm
merely
trying
to
show
what
kind
of
waters
they
were.
that
if
they
navigable
waters,
they
are
very
technically
set
and
as
such
whatever
goes
on
in
there
will
make
little
or
no
difference
as
far
as
the
uniformity
on
maritime
law
is
concern.
in
other
words,
they
are
not
type
of
navigable
waters
that
the
jensen
case
was
talking
about
or
concerned
about.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
now,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
hahn
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
yes,
sir.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
it's
the
choice
of
remedy
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
between
states
and
federal
law.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
well,
that's
the
argument
of
the
--
of
the
defendant
in
this
case,
your
honor.
our
argument
is
that
it's
a
choice
between
state
law
and
federal
law.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
oregon
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
well,
assuming
that
these
are
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
your
honor,
as
the
law
now
stands
and
as
i
understand
it,
we
would
have
to
show
that
this
was
a
case
that
fell
within
the
twilight
zone
in
order
for
the
oregon
law
to
apply.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
yes,
sir.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
well,
the
--
the
employer
rejected
it,
but
as
part
of
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act.
now
first,
your
honor,
i
don't
go
along
with
the
proposition
that
the
twilight
zone
and
only
between,
not
necessarily
between
two
compensation
acts.
i
say
it's
a
zone
setup
between
state
law
and
federal
law
and
usually,
there
are
two
compensation
acts,
the
longshore
act
in
one
side
and
the
state
compensation
act
on
the
other
side.
in
this
case,
the
employer
under
its
own
volition,
you
know,
not
only
rejected
the
compensation
act,
but
the
compensation
act
said,
“if
you
reject
this
act,
you
are
then
subject
to
an
action
for
negligence.”
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
and
so
we
have
come
in
here
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act
within
action
for
negligence
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
the
court
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
well,
the
compensation
act
took
it
all.
it
took
away
the
rights
of
all
workers,
except
the
compensation
if
the
employer
complied
with
the
act.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
now,
if
the
employer
takes
an
affirmative
step
and
refuses
to
comply
with
the
act,
then
of
course,
the
act
exist.
you're
entitled
to
sue
for
damages
with
certain
defenses
removed
from
under
the
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
that's
right.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
semantics
or
anything
like
that,
but
that
--
that's
what
i
mean
when
i
say
it's
pursuant
to
the
workmen's
compensation.
now,
in
this
case,
hahn
was
an
oiler
on
a
--
on
a
dredge.
i
pointed
out
on
exhibit
4
that
x
where
he
did
all
of
his
work
in
the
lagoon.this
dredge
was
anchored
to
shore.
he
never
went
outside
of
the
lagoon
at
any
time
in
connection
with
his
work
and
the
dredge,
of
course,
was
merely
dredging
up
sand
and
gravel
for
sale.
now,
on
the
day
of
the
jury,
he
was
doing
his
regular
work
for
several
hours
and
then
he
was
ordered
over
to
the
rock
pressure
which
of
course
is
in
the
lagoon
also
to
do
some
clean
up
work.
the
respondent
had
brought
in
to
the
lagoon
on
one
of
its
barges
from
the
sandy
river
which
is
nearby
a
hopper.
now,
a
hopper,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
include
one
in
the
record
here,
we
have
some
pictures
of
it.
but
a
hopper
is
merely
a
square
object
sitting
on
long
legs
on
which
sand
and
gravel
or
the
sand
and
gravel
is
put
in
the
top,
a
truck
drives
underneath,
a
lever
is
released
and
the
gravel
goes
into
the
bed
of
the
truck.
it's
a
method
of
loading
the
truck.
now,
this
hopper
was
owned
also
by
the
respondent.
it
was
brought
into
the
lagoon
and
by
means
of
a
land
based
crane,
they
were
transferring
this
hopper
from
this
one
barge
to
another
barge
tied
up
right
there
at
the
rock
pressure.
hahn
was
told
to
go
over
there
in
connection
with
this
changing
the
hopper
from
one
barge
to
another.
he
got
there
just
as
the
hopper
was
being
set
down
on
the
second
barge.
this
was
at
night.
it
was
dark.
hahn
was
then
ordered
to
go
up
the
hopper
to
the
top
and
release
the
--
the
cable
which
was
attached
to
the
crane
and
to
the
hopper
so
they
could
get
the
hopper
away
from
crane.
hahn
went
up
the
ladder.
he
got
through
to
the
top
practically
and
suddenly
the
ladder
pulled
away
from
the
hopper
completely.
he
fell
over
backwards,
of
course,
landed
on
his
back
and
was
very
seriously
injured
and
the
ladder
fell
on
top
of
him.
now,
the
evidence
shows
that
he
received
no
warning
of
the
condition
of
the
hopper
and
that
the
top
of
the
hopper
where
the
ladder
was
fastened
was
so
rocking
that
it
just
couldn't
hold
the
ladder.
it
was
--
the
ladder
was
nailed
which
was
in
violation
of
safety
rules,
which
of
the
course
of
law
in
oregon
and
there's
just
no
question
that
there
was
elementary
negligence
in
this
case.
hahn
has
not
worked
since
the
injury.
now,
the
respondent's
case
is
based
on
the
jensen
case
and
the
jensen
case
is
the
basis
for
which
you
might
say
mr.
hahn's
troubles
are
here.
jensen
case
of
course
was
decided
1917.
after
a
while,
the
jensen
doctrine
was
sought
and
somewhat
by
the
local
concerned
rule,
but
this
court
found
after
a
number
of
years
of
attempting
to
split
hairs
that
a
lot
of
hardship
was
being
caused
and
that
it
was
being
required
to
--
to
determine
from
a
factual
standpoint,
a
lot
of
cases
and
the
court
finally
decided
that
it
the
should
not
go
any
further
on
that
and
the
twilight
zone
was
born.
the
court
considered,
i
believe,
and
decided
not
to
overrule
the
jensen
case,
although
i
believe
it
was
seriously
considered.
but
in
order
to
prevent
hardship,
this
court
set
up,
of
course,
the
twilight
zone
in
which
the
workmen's
choice
of
remedy,
whether
the
state
or
federal
law
was
--
the
court
said
would
be
upheld.
if
the
workmen
went
in
in
this
twilight
zone,
in
this
area
of
doubt
shows
you
the
state
law
or
federal
law,
his
choice
should
be
upheld.
now,
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
this
employee
is
--
falls
within
the
twilight
zone.
i
think
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
--
with
the
facts
in
the
davis
case,
the
baskin
case,
the
morris
case
and
a
simple
comparison
of
the
facts,
i
think,
will
show
that
this
employee
did
fall
within
the
twilight
zone.
furthermore,
it
was
a
matter
purely
of
local
concern
in
this
case.
and
even
before
the
twilight
zone
was
setup,
this
employee
could
have
recovered
under
the
local
concerned
doctrine.
now,
it's
true
that
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
is
not
getting
pure
compensation.
but
i
--
i
want
to
emphasize
again
that
what
he
was
he
has
asked
for
in
this
case
was
provided
by
the
compensation
law.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
he
cannot
get
compensation
under
the
state
law
because
the
employer
rejected
the
act
on
its
own.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
but
for
the
rejection
of
the
act,
you
honor,
there
is
no
question
he
could
have
gotten
compensation.
no
question
about
it,
assuming
it
falls
in
the
twilight
zone.
now,
this
court
in
the
davis
case
set
up
--
not
set
up,
but
reaffirmed,
i
should
probably
say,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
of
state
law.
and
this
is
of
course
is
purely
a
constitutional
question.
can
oregon
apply
its
laws
in
this
particular
situation?
and
of
course,
the
court
said
in
the
davis
case,
that
prima
facie,
every
state
is
entitled
to
enforce
in
its
own
courts
its
own
statutes
lawfully
enacted.
now,
that
--
incidentally,
that
presumption
of
constitutionality
was
not
discussed
by
the
oregon
court
in
its
decision
and
has
not
been
discussed
but
the
respondent
in
its
briefs.
the
oregon
court
in
its
decision
relied
on
cases
such
as
pennsylvania
railroad
company
versus
o'rourke
which
was
decided
by
this
court
some
five
or
six
years
ago
in
330
--
344
u.s.
the
o'rourke
case,
in
our
opinion,
is
completely
inapplicable
to
this
situation
here.
that
was
purely
a
case
of
statutory
construction
and
the
court
so
stated
in
footnote
8
of
its
opinion,
purely
statutory
construction
between
two
federal
acts.
this
of
course
is
a
constitutional
question.
the
court
relied
--
the
oregon
court
relied
on
certain
language
in
the
o'rourke
case
to
the
effect
that
new
jersey
could
not
have
provided
compensation
for
this
injured
work
on
navigable
waters.
well,
obviously,
new
jersey
could
not
have
done
that
because
the
injured
workmen
in
that
case
was
a
railroad
worker
and
of
course,
there's
no
question
that
no
state
can
apply
its
compensation
laws
to
a
railroad
worker.
i
don't
--
the
oregon
court
is
not
the
only
court
that
has
misinterpreted
the
o'rourke
case.
it's
been
misinterpreted
by
other
courts
and
the
respondent
here
relies
heavily
on
a
--
on
a
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
case
and
filed
a
supplemental
brief
in
connection
with
that
case,
which
this
case
was
decided
recently.
i
believe
there's
a
new
jersey
case
in
which
the
o'rourke
case
was
also
misconstrued.
as
far
as
the
fifth
circuit
of
appeals
is
concerned
and
the
oregon
supreme
court,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
those
courts
do
like
the
twilight
zone
or
the
davis
doctrine.
it's
just
a
situation
of
those
court
not
liking
that
solution.
they
like
the
cut
and
dried
proposition
that
was
set
out
in
the
parker
versus
motor
boat
sales
case
where
you
just
draw
a
straight
line.
but
of
course,
the
parker
case
must
be
construed
in
connection
with
the
davis
case.
now,
under
the
davis
case,
the
court
said
under
the
jensen
hypothesis
basic
conditions
are
factual.
does
the
state
law
interfere
with
the
proper
harmony
and
uniformity
of
maritime
law?
if
the
state
law
does
not
interfere
with
proper
harmony
in
uniform
with
the
maritime
law,
then
of
course
the
state
has
a
right
to
apply
its
own
law.
now,
i
have
been
in
connection
with
this
case
from
the
beginning.
this
man
was
hurt
in
1955.
i've
been
through
three
courts
with
this
case
and
i'm
still
unable
to
figure
out
how,
allowing
this
injured
workman
to
recover
this
judgement
which
he
received
in
the
oregon
court
is
going
to
under
the
facts
interfere
with
the
uniformity
of
maritime
law.
it's
argued
that
the
jensen
that
--
that
under
the
oregon
law,
under
the
employers'
liability
act
that
there's
two
high
standard
of
care.
now,
there
is
no
higher
standard
of
care
than
workmen's
compensation.
that's
a
liability
without
fault
and
yet
there
is
not
question
in
the
twilight
zone,
workmen's
compensation
is
proper.
if
the
employers'
liability
act
has
a
lesser
standard
of
care
and
of
course
the
ludicrous
thing
about
the
whole
thing
is
that
the
case
that
setup
this
entire
doctrine,
the
jensen
case,
talking
about
interfering
with
the
uniformity
of
maritime
law
was
based
on
the
jensen
case
which
was
a
workmen's
compensation
statute.
and
yet,
there
is
no
question
now
that
workmen's
compensation
can
be
--
laws
can
be
applied.
furthermore,
there's
a
lot
situation
in
maritime
law
where
there
is
a
very
high
standard
of
care.
in
fact,
liability
without
fault.
and
of
course,
in
this
case
as
i
pointed
out
before
and
i
would
like
to
say
it
again,
under
the
fact,
this
employer
was
guilty
of
plain
ordinary
--
regarding
a
variety
of
negligence.
you
don't
have
to
go
any
higher
than
that.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
my
answer
to
that
is
this,
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
valid
argument.
they
make
it.
i
think
you're
just
posing
it
here
as
a
question.
in
many
situations
--
or
in
some
situations
possibly,
it
would
be
considered
to
--
to
interfere
with
uniformity
and
it
might
be
a
bad
situation
to
subject
an
employer
to
a
situation
like
that
where
he
couldn't
protect
himself.
now,
they
cite
gilmore
and
black,
where
gilmore
and
black
suggest
that
there's
no
twilight
zone
between
the
longshore
act
and
the
employers
liability
--
federal
employers'
liability
act,
the
jones
act
and
so
on.
and
suggest
that
the
reason
is
because
this
court
doesn't
want
to
subject
an
employer
to
that
--
the
difference
between
a
compensation
act
at
one
end
and
a
jury
verdict
on
the
another
end,
which
they
can
do
nothing
to
protect
themselves
against.
all
right,
in
this
case,
all
the
employer
has
to
do
is
to
comply
with
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act
which
most
employers
do
and
he
can
completely
protect
himself
against
any
judgement
under
the
employer
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
anytime
this
employer
wants
to
comply
with
the
act,
he
can
get
the
protection
of
the
act
and
only
have
to
make
compensation
payments.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
yes,
your
honor.
it
does.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
pardon?
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
that's
right.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
the
record
shows
this
employer
did
comply
with
the
longshoremen's
act.
i
might
say
in
that
connection
now
that
it's
--
it's
mentioned,
your
honor,
that
the
argument,
remedy
against
an
employer
who
fails
to
comply
with
the
workmen's
compensation
act
is
practically
the
same
as
an
employer
who
fails
to
comply
with
the
longshoremen's
act.
both
of
them
are
subjected
when
you
--
you
mentioned
misdemeanor,
but
in
the
longshore
act,
he's
also
subjected
to
an
action
for
damages,
for
negligence
with
all
the
defense
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
and
all
of
these
common
law
defenses
are
taken
away
from
him
just
like
here.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
well,
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
fails
to
comply
with
the
oregon
workmen's
compensation
act.
for
the
ordinary
land-based
employee,
there
is
no
question
he
is
subjected
to
this
law
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
--
we've
talked
about.
yes.
and
in
the
twilight
zone,
there
should
be
no
difference.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
of
course,
that's
the
davis
case,
your
honor.
that
a
person
in
twilight
zone
is
entitled
to
recover
under
either
act,
whichever
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
fell
off
a
barge.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
yes.
he
fell
off
the
barge
while
he
was
loading
steel.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
that's
what
he
was
doing.
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
if
he
had
indicated
that
whichever
act
he'd
applied
under,
whichever
one
he
--
he
asked
for,
he
could
have
gotten.
now
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
that's
right.
the
state
of
washington
through
four
different
tribunals
had
held
he
could
not
recover
and
this
court
said
he
could.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
parker
case
where
he
applied
for
relief
under
the
longshore
act
and
that
was
a
situation
that
appeared
to
come
under
the
local
concerned
doctrine,
but
in
that
case
where
he
--
where
he
required
for
relief
under
the
longshore
act.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said,
“no,
it's
a
local
concern.”
but
this
court
reversed
and
said,
“no,
that's
what
he
asked
for,
that's
what
he
is
going
to
get.”
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
that's
what
i'd
like
to
know,
your
honor.
there's
no
assurance
that
this
man
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
that's
the
exactly
the
reason
your
honors
decided
for
setting
up
the
twilight
zone
because
whichever
way
an
injured
worker
went,
the
employers
who
naturally
--
or
their
insurance
companies
are
naturally
interested
in
saving
money.
they
--
they're
very
clever.
they
can
always
find
a
reason
why
this
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence.
whichever
way
this
men
went,
it
sometimes
take
four
or
five
years
for
them
to
establish
their
rights.
in
this
case
they
say,
“oh,
you
can
get
your
longshoremen's
benefits.”
well
then,
we
can
and
maybe
we
can't.
they
didn't
asked
for
it.
this
maybe
--
it
might
go
just
as
far.
they'd
say,
“oh,
no,
you
should
go
over
on
the
state
side.”
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
none
whatsoever.
they
just
said
it
did,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
think
they
cited
any
reason
for
it
all
and
they
just
categorically
set
up
that
--
on
their
own
that
--
that
if
you
couldn't
get
anymore
that
compensation
either
because
--
and
as
i
said,
they
used
the
o'rourke
case
pretty
much
as
their
authority
for
that.
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
the
--
mr.
lafky
is
here,
your
honor,
and
he
will
explain
that.
he's
--
i'm
giving
him
10
minutes
of
my
time
if
--
if
that's
agreeable.
i
have
only
five
minutes.
i'm
going
to
take
only
40
minutes,
give
mr.
lafky
10
if
that's
agreeable.
now,
many
people
are
affected
by
this
case.
i
want
to
point
this
out.
we
show
in
our
brief
that
25%
to
40%
of
the
workers
in
this
country
are
not
covered
by
compensation
and
an
awful
lot
of
those
people
at
sometime
or
another
and
maybe
all
the
time
comes
within
the
twilight
zone.
you
can
just
let
your
imaginations
run
as
to
all
the
different
situations
where
all
these
workers
would
come
in
to
the
twilight
zone
at
sometime
or
another.
now,
just
because
all
of
those
people
are
not
covered
by
state
compensation,
does
that
mean
that
they
are
--
all
of
them
to
be
completely
deprived
of
all
of
their
state
remedies?
this
case
holds
that.
in
oregon,
there
is
over
2000
miles
of
navigable
waters.
now,
some
states
don't
have
that
much
and
some
have
more
and
there's
100
of
employers,
small
employers,
big
employers
along
those
navigable
waters.
now,
all
the
employees
of
those
people
to
--
to
be
--
to
be
deprived
of
all
their
state
remedies
if
they
reject
the
act
of
if
they
aren't
covered
by
the
act.
as
i
say,
there's
25%
to
40%
of
the
workers
in
this
country
that
are
not
covered
by
any
kind
of
workmen's
compensation.
a
lot
of
these
employers,
the
small
employers,
the
loggers,
the
farmers
who
float
their
produce
down
the
river
and
saw
it
never
heard
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
they
haven't
complied
with
it.
a
lot
of
them
wouldn't
think
they
were
covered
under
if
they
had
heard
of
it.
i
think
it's
30%
of
the
people
in
this
country
don't
even
know
who
the
president
of
the
united
states
is.
now,
workmen's
compensation,
this
court,
i
think,
everyone
agrees
and
practically
is
a
good
thing
and
there's
a
lot
of
non-negligent
injuries
where
people
should
be
covered
by
workmen's
compensation.
but
employers,
some
of
them,
a
lot
of
them,
look
at
it
only
from
a
coal
dollar
and
cent
standpoint
and
they
like
to
avoid
the
expense
of
taking
out
workmen's
compensation
if
they
can.
so,
in
order
to
make
these
employers
comply
with
compensation
acts,
it's
necessary
to
have
coercive
measures
in
the
compensation
acts.
and
that's
exactly
what
they
have
in
the
oregon
act,
and
the
reason
that
it's
put
in
there
is
clearly
and
only
to
force
these
employers
to
comply
with
the
act.
now,
under
the
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court,
the
employers
are
encouraged
to
reject
the
act.
because
they
can
reject
the
act
and
then
if
they
do
reject
the
act,
they
don't
come
under
any
of
the
alternate
provisions
of
the
sanctions.
so
it's
a
good
example
of
a
man
having
his
cake
after
he
had
already
eaten.
they
can
reject
the
act
and
completely
avoid
liability
under
state
law
by
rejecting
the
act
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
encourages
that.
i
say
that
the
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
is
illogical.
and
if
you
allow
the
oregon
supreme
court's
decision
to
stand,
you
are
allowing
an
employer
to
unilaterally
make
a
constitutional
determination.
in
other
words,
the
employer,
if
he
complies
with
the
oregon
compensation
act,
allows
his
employees
--
his
employees
unconstitutionally
come
under
state
law.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
decision
stands
and
that
employer
rejects
the
compensation
act,
he
is
constitutionally
deciding
that
none
of
his
employees
are
subject
to
state
law
and
i'd
say
that
is
a
ridiculous
situation.
there
are
over
two
million
industrial
accidents
a
year
and
any
decision
like
this,
which
encourages
employers
to
reject
compensation
acts
should
be
scrutinized
with
a
great
deal
of
care
because
this
case
encourages
an
employer
to
reject
the
compensation
act.
now,
the
united
states
construction
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
about
the
costs?
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
the
cost?
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
your
honor,
that's
--
mr.
dwight
l.
schwab
it's
not
--
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
it's
tremendous.
and
harry
hahn,
of
course,
was
injured
near
four
years
ago
and
he
has
had
become
clear
to
this
court
just
to
establish
his
right
to
obtain
state
relief
and
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
the
davis
case
is
that
here
there's
negligence,
in
the
davis
case,
it's
compensation.
