justice
stewart
just
suggested
--
justice
william

--
i
suppose
this
is
the
answer,
if
the
employee
where
you
projected
the
act
and
established
negligence,
he's
likely
to
do
what
was
done
here,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
he
can't
establish
negligence,
he
might
take
advantage
of
this
private
insurance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
question
that
justice
stewart
put
earlier,
what
about
the
finding
of
navigable
waters?
would
that
be
res
judicata
in
a
proceeding
if
you
would
have
bring
it
under
the
longshoremen's
act?
