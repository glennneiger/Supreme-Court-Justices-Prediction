mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
particular
case,
the
petitioners
were
originally
indicted
in
the
district
court
for
the
offense
of
felony,
not
a
misdemeanor
but
the
offense
of
felony
for
a
conspiracy
to
avoid
and
evade
the
payment
of
federal
tax
relating
to
wagering.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
wagering,
wagers.
there
are
only
four
of
these
petitioners
before
the
court.
originally,
there
were
31
defendants
indicted.
numerous
of
the
defendants
were
acquitted.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
26.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
and,
there
were
a
group
of
them
acquitted,
some
were
convicted.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
they
were
approximately
eight
or
nine
counsel
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
the
case
consumed
almost
a
month
to
try,
a
little
less
than
four
weeks,
four
full
weeks.
boiling
all
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
the
long
involved
facts
over
the
period
of
four
weeks,
down
to
its
very
essentials,
i
think
that
i
could
fairly
state
that
the
evidence
amounted
to
this.
as
to
the
petitioner
horace
ingram,
the
fact
showed
that
he
was
the
banker
or
the
principal
involved
in
a
lottery
known
as
the
numbers
game.
the
petitioners
rufus
jenkins,
mary
law
and
l.
e.
smith
can
fairly
be
shown
by
the
evidence
to
have
been
employees
of
horace
ingram,
not
principal
but
employees.
mary
law,
i
believe,
the
--
the
only
evidence
that
connects
her
at
all
with
the
offense
is
that,
in
one
occasion,
she
was
found
to
have
been
checking
tickets
at
a
lottery
headquarters
and,
likewise,
the
evidence
seems
to
be
abundant
as
to
the
petitioner
smith,
to
that
affect
and
probably
that
he
performed
some
other
errands
in
and
about
the
lottery
business.
and,
as
to
the
petitioner
rufus
jenkins,
i
don't
know
exactly
what
connection
the
evidence
actually
would
show
that
he
had
or
what
part
he
played,
but
it
at
--
at
the
very
least,
we'd
say
that
it
does
not
show
him
to
be
a
banker.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that,
if
your
honor
please,
was
because
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
did
convict
him
upon
the
substantive
count
of
failing
to
pay
the
tax,
as
well
as
the
felony
conviction
on
a
conspiracy.
and,
we
say
that
it
--
that
that
finding,
of
course,
was
completely
without
evidence,
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
any
finding
that
rufus
jenkins
was
a
principal
in
this
particular
enterprise.
now,
we
do
admit
and
we
concede
that,
as
to
horace
ingram,
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
the
misdemeanor
conviction
of
failure
to
pay,
but
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it
did
not.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
nothing.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
your
honor,
there
was
no
evidence
that
i
can
recall
of
that
particular
fact.
the
evidence
in
the
case
seemed
to
be
based
upon
the
fact,
altogether,
that
there
was
a
large-scale
lottery
operation
being
conducted
in
this
case.
and,
other
than
that,
the
government,
in
order
to
try
to
pass
some
federal
liability
upon
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
as
distinguished
from
the
state
violation
for
operating
a
lottery,
attempted
to
show
that,
in
the
operation
of
this
lottery,
that
the
defendants
and
the
alleged
conspirators,
in
carrying
out
this
lottery,
concealed
their
activities.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
concealment
of
funds.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
concealment
of
items
which
would
be
related
to
tax
or
which
would
be
related
directly
to
tax
or
to
income
in
any
way,
but
the
concealment
was
shown
to
have
consisted
of
having
cars
painted
different
colors
or
changing
headquarters
from
day
to
day
and
things
of
that
nature
that
the
government
contended
were
concealment
and,
of
course,
we
admit
that
they
did
show
concealment.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
was
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
do
not
believe,
if
your
honor
please,
that
there
was
any
other
evidence
as
to
the
size
of
the
operation
with
--
with
respect
to
anything
except
that
one
statement,
and
that
was
a
statement
attributed
to
have
been
made
by
ingram
to
one
of
the
state
investigators
sometime,
i
believe,
a
year
--
about
a
year
before
the
actual
raid
was
made
on
march
27th,
1957.
and,
that
was
an
admission
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
made
at
that
time
that
his
business
had
been
reduced
to
$3,500
a
day.
independently
of
that,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
other
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
record
is
bad.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
that
is
completely
solemn.
there
is
no
--
the
--
the
entire
evidence
in
the
case,
as
i
stated,
for
the
period
of
four
weeks,
was
devoted
to
the
operation
of
the
lottery
and
the
only
time
tax
was
ever
mentioned
was
by
one
witness
who
was
a
government
witness
to
the
effect
that
the
defendants
had
not
registered
or
paid
their
tax.
that
was
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
that
was
--
apparently,
the
government
was
not
concerned
with
that
at
that
particular
time.
that
is
the
reason
that
we
--
that
is
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
the
compliant
that
we
are
making.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
now,
of
course
the
government
contends
that,
in
as
much
as
this
thing
went
on
over
a
period
of
a
year-and-a
half
or
two
years,
that
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
the
showing
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
we
--
we
don't
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
we
don't
deny
that.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
now,
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
government
contends
that,
your
honor.
the
government
contends
that,
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
so
closely
connected
in
the
lottery
headquarters
in
checking
up
tickets,
that
they
must
have
known
that
he
wasn't
paying
the
tax.
i
believe
that
that's
what
the
government
bases
their
case
upon.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
only
proof
in
the
record
that
a
tax
was
due
was
the
evidence
of
the
fact
that
these
persons
were
engaged
in
the
operation
of
a
lottery
in
one
capacity
or
another,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
they
should
have
registered
and
paid
the
excise
tax
of
$50
per
year.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
there
is
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right,
except
as
to
the
--
in
other
words,
we
do
not
raise
the
point
as
to
ingram
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
but
as
to
the
other
defendants.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no
question.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no
question.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
we
raise
no
question
there.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
judge
relied
very
heavily
upon
the
spies
case
on
the
question
of
concealment
as
to
whether
or
not
evidence
of
concealment
was
sufficient
to
show
a
conspiracy
to
evade
and
defeat
the
payment
of
a
federal
tax.
now,
of
course,
the
spies
case
was
a
substantive
case.
it
was
not
a
conspiracy.
spies
had
admitted,
at
the
opening
of
the
trial,
that
he
had
failed
to
pay
the
tax
and
that
the
tax
was
due
and,
therefore,
had
admitted
a
misdemeanor.
the
only
question
in
the
spies
case
was
whether
evidence
of
concealment
was
sufficient
to
raise
the
offense
from
the
degree
of
a
misdemeanor
of
failing
to
pay
to
the
degree
of
a
felony
of
attempting
to
evade
and
defeat
its
payment.
and,
of
course,
this
court
held
that
evidence
of
concealment
was
sufficient
to
show
that.
but,
now,
in
the
--
in
the
present
case,
we
say
that
the
present
case
is
inapplicable
to
the
spies
case
for
these
three
different
reasons.
first,
the
only
question
in
the
spies
case
involved
was
wether
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony
applied
and,
therefore,
the
evidence
of
concealment
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
in
order
to
raise
it
from
a
misdemeanor
to
the
felony.
second,
we
say
that
the
concealment
in
that
case
was
of
items
directly
related
to
income.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
falsification
of
books
or
the
hiding
of
income
or
anything
of
that
nature
directly
related
to
income
would
tend
to
raise
it
from
a
misdemeanor
to
a
felony.
and,
the
third
thing
that
distinguishes
it
is
that
that
charge
was
a
charge
it
--
was
a
substantive
charge
and
concealment
was
one
of
direct
elements
involved
in
the
charge
against
spies
to
raise
it
from
a
misdemeanor
to
a
felony,
whereas,
in
the
case
at
bar,
being
a
felony
conspiracy
and
the
evidence
concededly
showing
that
these
other
the
petitioners
were
not,
or
at
least
two
of
them,
perhaps
maybe
the
third
one,
but
at
least
two
of
them,
it's
been
conceded
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
conceded
when
the
jury
found
them
not
guilty,
that
they
were
not
themselves
liable
to
the
payment
of
tax.
and,
here,
the
government
comes
in
and
attempts
to
use
evidence
of
concealment
as
direct
evidence
to
show
that
they
had
violated
the
federal
law,
whereas,
in
spies
case,
that
situation
was
entirely
different.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
the
part
that
i'm
getting
to,
if
your
honor
please.
under
georgia
law,
it
is
a
violation.
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
operate
a
lottery
under
section
26-6502
of
the
georgia
code.
i've
set
that
out
in
my
brief.
it's
a
misdemeanor
under
georgia
law,
and
the
point
we
raise
is
this.
that
concealment,
in
this
case,
if
the
government
relies
upon
concealment
as
evidence
to
show
that
the
federal
law
has
been
violated,
then
the
government's
case
must
fall
because
concealment
was
a
necessary
element
to
the
successful
operation
of
the
--
in
order
to
have
violated
the
state
law.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
now
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
if
your
honor
please,
perhaps
i
can
explain
my
position
in
this
way,
that
--
that,
under
the
state
law,
it
is
a
misdemeanor
admittedly
and,
being
a
misdemeanor
and
being
a
violation
of
law,
therefore,
concealment
would
be
considered
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
be
able
to
evade
the
state
law
and
to
operate
a
lottery.
it
couldn't
be
operated
openly
unless
it
was
operated
in
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
point
that
we
are
raising.
it
certainly
would
be
true
as
to
them
for
this
reason.
they
admittedly
were
not
required
or
liable
for
the
payment
of
any
federal
tax
and,
therefore,
how
could
their
concealment
be
said
to
be
any
evidence
of
a
--
of
--
of
the
other.
now,
i
have
--
my
time
is
up
right
now
and
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
question
of
concealment,
we
say
that
there
can
be
no
logical
inference
that
can
be
drawn
in
this
case
but
that
the
concealment
was
for
--
solely
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
detection,
prosecution,
and
punishment
from
the
state
authorities.
and,
i
make
that
statement
for
this
reason.
the
operation
of
a
lottery
is
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia,
and
all
these
persons
who
were
involved
in
the
operation
of
the
lottery
in
any
capacity
were
liable
as
principals
under
the
state
law.
all
the
petitioners
in
this
court
were
liable
under
the
state
law.
we
also
contend
that,
under
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
kahriger,
that
three
of
these
petitioners
would
certainly
not
have
been
liable
for
the
payment
of
any
federal
tax
and,
therefore,
it
would
be
illogical
to
hold
that
concealment
on
their
part
was
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
or
evading
the
payment
of
federal
tax
when
there
was
no
tax
liability
there
and
that,
consequently,
concealment
can
only
be
considered,
logically,
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
having
--
for
escaping
detection,
prosecution,
and
punishment
from
the
state
authorities.
and,
we
say
this
also
with
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
also
believe
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
don't
--i
don't
believe
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
any
jury
could
draw
the
inference
in
this
case
or
would
be
permissible
to
draw
an
inference
in
this
case
that
concealment
was
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
detection
under
the
federal
law
when
there
was
no
liability
on
their
part
to
the
payment
of
any
federal
tax.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
there
could
be.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
now,
of
course,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
highly
possible
and
i've
thought
of
that
also,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
concealment
was
for
that
purpose
and
that
is
our
point
that
--
that
--
the
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
of
course
it
would
be
illegal
under
state
law,
but
we
said
--
we
say
not
illegal
under
federal
and
that,
consequently,
there
would
be
no
evidence
that
the
concealment
was
for
that
purpose
because
it
was
not
consuming
of
items
directly
related
to
tax.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
because
the
payment
or
nonpayment
of
the
federal
tax
was
a
question
that
was
up
to
ingram
himself
and
not
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
up
to
these
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it
doesn't
mean
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
it
doesn't
mean,
if
your
honor
please,
that
they
could
not
have
conspired
with
him,
but
it
means
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
he
could
have
--
he
could
have
been
paying
his
tax.
there's
no
evidence
to
the
effect
that
they
knew.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
he
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
sir.
that
would
be
up
to
the
state
authorities
to
find
that
from
the
federal.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
he
would
register
at
the
--
at
the
director
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
in
atlanta.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
if
there
were
evidence
to
that
extent,
your
honor,
they
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
the
government
would
have
made
out
a
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
director
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
of
course,
state
authorities
don't
often.
there
are
--
it
--
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
your
honor,
that
some
of
these
operators
in
various
states
do
register
and
pay
their
tax
and
some
do
not.
and,
of
course,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
imputed
to
them
whether
he
had
or
had
not.
we
--
we
liken
it
to
the
--
to
the
same
type
of
a
case
if
a
man
runs
a
large
department
store
and
he
has
many
agents
working
for
them
sales
people
and
cashiers
and
otherwise,
and
the
fact
that
he
evades
and
defeats
the
payment
of
his
income
tax,
that
no
inference
can
be
drawn
that
the
sales
people
who
work
for
him
are
assisting
him
in
that
or
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
with
him
to
do
that
because
of
the
fact
that
they
work
for
him.
and,
we
say
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
well,
we
contend
that
the
evidence
doesn't
indicate
that
and
that
--
that
there
is
no
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
that.
if
your
honor
please,
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
law
does
require
that,
but
that
was
not
charged
in
the
indictment
in
this
case
as
one
of
the
--
either
the
objects
or
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
there
was
no
evidence
of
that.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
that
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
now,
that
of
course,
if
there
was
evidence
that
they
knew
that
it
had
not
been
posted,
that
probably
would
be
evidence
of
the
fact
that
they
knew
that
he
hadn't
paid
his
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
federal
tax.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
believe
that's
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor,
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
sir.
now,
we
contend
this
also.
i'd
like
to
make
this
point
clear
to
the
court.
that
ingram,
the
banker,
cannot
be
guilty
of
a
conspiracy
because
he
cannot
conspire
with
himself.
just
merely
the
fact
that
he
would
be
required
to
pay
the
tax
would
not
make
him
guilty
of
a
conspiracy.
if
--
if
the
court
finds
that
he
was
required
to
pay
the
tax
and
of
course
--
and
if
he
was
the
only
one
that
did
not
conspire
with
any
of
these
other
persons
who
were
engaged
as
employees,
then,
of
course,
he
could
not
be
convicted
of
the
conspiracy,
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
he
was
convicted
of.
now,
one
other
thing
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
that
is
this,
that
there
are
two
different
types
of
conspiracies.
there's
a
main
conspiracy
and
a
subsidiary
conspiracy,
and
these
rules
were
laid
down
in
the
grunewald,
lutwak,
and
krulewitch
cases
by
this
court.
and,
the
teaching
of
those
cases
means
this.
that
if
the
object
of
a
conspiracy
embraces
concealment
as
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
substantive
offense
itself,
then
concealment
belongs
to
the
main
conspiracy.
whereas,
if
the
object
of
concealment
is
to
escape
detection,
prosecution,
and
punishment,
it
--
it
is
merely
a
subsidiary
conspiracy.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
concealment
was
to
avoid
detection
from
--
detention,
prosecution,
and
punishment.
if
that
be
the
case,
then,
of
course,
it
is
merely
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
conceal.
it
was
not
a
part
of
the
substantive
offense
--
or
the
--
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
itself.
and,
being
subsidiary,
then
the
proof
of
it
would
not
tend
to
prove
the
main
conspiracy
itself
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
which
would
prove
the
main
conspiracy
itself.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
that
the
instruction
would
be
involved
because
we
contend
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
support
that.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
instruction
--
the
instructions
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
we
--
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
accept
the
instructions
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
and
i
think
they
were
correct,
but
i
do
not
believe
the
evidence
were
sufficient
to
support
them.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
in
this
case,
the
evidence,
as
outlined
by
the
government,
still
fails
to
show
that
any
of
these
other
persons
had
any
pecuniary
interest
in
this
enterprise
as
a
principal.
the
fact
that
mary
law's
having
been
seen
on
numerous
occasions
going
out,
the
testimony
by
the
same
witness
also
shows
on
cross
examination
that
on
none
of
those
occasions
did
he
ever
trail
mary
law
and
find
that
she
was
actually
at
a
lottery
headquarters,
and
the
same
thing
holds
true
as
to
the
other.
they
just
simply
said
that
they
got
together
about
that
time
and
they
were
seen
driving
out
in
different
parts
of
town
on
different
days.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
case
to
indicate
that
mary
law,
at
anytime,
had
any
pecuniary
interest
how
much
he
would
receive,
how
much
he
would
be
paid,
and
whether
or
not
she
ever
handled
any
money.
now,
the
government
relies
pretty
heavily
upon
the
expert
testimony
in
this
case,
but
the
expert
testimony
merely
goes
to
the
fact
of
how
the
lottery
operates
and
it
does
not
specifically
show
what
went
on
in
this
particular
case.
and,
i
stated
in
my
opening
and
i've
stated
in
my
brief,
we've
conceded
that
this
was
a
large-scale
lottery
operation,
but
this
court
is
not
concerned
with
the
size
of
the
operation.
this
court
is
not
concerned
with
the
fact
that
these
persons
violated
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia.
this
court
is
concerned
only
with
whether
or
not
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
show
that
a
conspiracy
was
entered
into
to
evade
and
defeat
the
payment
of
federal
tax.
and,
in
that
connection,
i
want
to
say
that,
again,
and
reiterate
to
the
court
that
if
horace
ingram
owed
federal
taxes
and
did
not
pay
them
all,
if
he
evaded
and
defeated
the
payment
of
it.
but,
if
that
was
solely
his
idea
as
to
the
evasion
and
to
the
defeating
of
those
federal
taxes,
and
there's
no
evidence
that
any
other
person
actually
conspired
with
him
to
evade
and
defeat
the
payment
of
the
tax,
but
that
the
evidence
merely
shows
that
they
simply
did
assist
him
in
the
operation
of
a
lottery,
then
the
conviction
against
horace
ingram
on
the
conspiracy
count
should
not
stand.
and,
likewise,
the
conviction
as
to
all
of
the
others
in
the
case,
to
be
allowed
to
stand
upon
the
record
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
would
be
actually
in
conflict
with
the
kahriger
case
from
this
court.
now,
we
also
want
to,
again,
reiterate
that
this
concealment
or
conspiracy
to
conceal
in
this
case
was
not
a
main
conspiracy
or
was
not
main.
it
was
subsidiary
and,
being
subsidiary,
we
--
we
must
consider
that,
along
with
the
extension
of
the
grunewald
and
the
lutwak
and
the
krulewitch
case,
that
there
should
be
an
extension
of
the
principle
in
that
or
the
doctrine
of
that
case
--
in
those
cases.
there
should
be
an
extensions
so
that,
where
it
is
merely
a
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
conceal,
then
the
proof
of
that
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
conceal
should
not
be
accepted
as
proof
of
the
conspiracy
itself
where
there
is
no
other
evidence
independent
of
that
subsidiary
evidence
of
subsidiary
conspiracy
to
conceal.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
violation
of
the
laws.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
would
like
to
add
to
that,
if
your
honor
please,
that
this
--
that
this
was
actually
stated
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
concealment
was
for
the
purpose
of
evading
prosecution
and
punishment,
and
that
if
the
concealment
is
merely
for
that
purpose
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
committing
the
crime
itself,
and
i
think
i
pointed
that
out
in
my
brief,
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
concealment
then,
of
course,
it
would
be
subsidiary
and,
being
subsidiary,
himself
would
not
be
sufficient
standing
alone
to
prove
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
federal
law,
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it's
a
misdemeanor
also,
but
it
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
it
willfully
--
willfully
evading
and
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
defeating
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
would
be
a
felony.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
because
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
because
the
state
--
the
state
violation
would
be
--
would
be
inherent
that
these
persons
had
violated
the
state
law,
but
no
evidence
that
these
persons
had
violated
the
federal
law
independently
of
that
concealment.
and,
therefore,
the
concealment
itself
would
have
to
be
said
to
be
the
federal
violation,
to
make
out
the
federal
violation,
because,
without
it,
the
government
has
nothing.
the
government
has
no
evidence
that
these
persons
are
liable
to
the
payment
of
tax
and,
therefore,
the
concealment
would
--
could
--
could
only
logic
--
it
could
only
logically
follow
that
a
jury
should
only
--
could
only
conclude
that
the
concealment
was
for
the
purpose
of
escaping
detection,
prosecution,
and
punishment
from
the
state
authorities
because
that
was
the
only
law
that
they
had
violated
because
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
they
violated
the
federal
law
because
they
had
not
violated
the
federal
law
were
it
not
for
the
concealment
itself.
and,
therefore
the
concealment
itself
must
be
used
to
make
out
the
federal
violation.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
of
course,
since
this
court
has
passed
upon
a
question
in
the
kahriger
case,
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
change
the
law
so
as
to
put
these
persons
within
the
purview
of
the
wagering
tax
act.
and,
so,
we
must,
therefore,
that
congress
accepts
that
as
their
intent.
