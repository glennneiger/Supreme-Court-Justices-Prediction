mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
some
of
the
gambling
terminology
used
in
this
case
is
different
from
that
in
calamaro.
in
calamaro,
there
was
involved
the
writer,
the
writer
being
the
person
who
receives
the
wager
from
the
beter
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
banker,
the
person
you
has
the
financial
risk
in
the
wager.
the
evidence
indicated
that
the
pickup
man
involved
in
that
enterprise
was
simply
a
messenger.
this
court
held
in
calamaro
that
the
pickup
man
was
not
liable
for
the
special
stamp
tax
since
he
was
not,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
receiving
wagers.
now,
there
was
expert
testimony
in
this
case
as
to
a
typical
large
lottery
operation
in
atlanta.
in
atlanta,
you
have
the
writer
and
the
banker.
a
pickup
man
was
very
different.
a
pickup
man
would
be
a
writer
who
would
supervise
other
writers.
he
would
recruit
writers
and
it's
his
job
to
see
that
the
--
the
tickets
were
all
picked
up
by
a
certain
time
so
that
they
would
be
in
the
hands
of
trusted
personnel
of
the
banker
before
the
winning
number
became
known
in
atlanta.
there's
also
a
ribbon
man.
now,
a
ribbon
man,
in
essence,
is
a
banker
who
is
laying-off
bets
with
another
larger
banker
and
his
--his
compensation
is
the
weigh
of
percentage
from
the
other
banker.
there
is
testimony
as
to
that,
expert
testimony
as
to
that.
now,
the
mere
messenger
which
would
be
comparable
to
the
pickup
man
in
calamaro
was
called
a
drag
man,
a
sack
man,
or
a
pickup
boy
and
it
was
his
job
to
carry
the
tickets
from
points
in
atlanta,
usually
what
they
called
a
stash,
a
place
where
they
hid
the
tickets
or
after
they
were
delivered
to
him
from
the
pickup
man,
to
carry
the
tickets
from
atlanta
to
a
rendezvous
outside
of
atlanta
in
the
countryside.
and,
there,
the
drag
man
or
the
sack
man,
as
he's
called,
would
deliver
these
tickets
to
the
headquarters
personnel
and,
sometimes,
to
the
banker
at
this
rendezvous
location.
now,
there
was
a
check
up
--
what
they
called,
in
this
case,
a
check
up
headquarters.
that
is
the
--
was
a
place
out
in
the
countryside
in
atlanta,
a
secret
place,
where
the
tickets
were
checked
over
to
find
if
there
were
any
winning
numbers
and
to
make
up
the
records
necessary
for
settling
accounts
between
the
writers,
the
pick
up
man,
and
the
banker.
this
location
was,
it
was
testified,
usually
kept
secrets
from
the
mere
messenger
because
of
the
fact
that
the
messenger,
if
apprehended,
would
be
inclined
to
cooperate
with
the
law
enforcement
officers
and
reveal
the
location
of
this
secret
headquarters
out
in
the
country.
this
headquarters
changed
periodically
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
detected.
the
headquarters
--
there
were
also
involved
in
the
operation
in
atlanta
people
called
the
headquarters
personnel.
these
people
were
certainly
more
than
mere
clerks.
they
knew
the
location
of
the
secret
check
up
headquarters
where
the
tickets
were
going
over
and
the
records
prepared
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
work
there.
they
had
to
be
personnel
who
were
close
to
and
trusted
by
the
banker
for
the
simple
reason
that,
at
the
time
that
they
worked
with
the
tickets,
was
a
time
after
the
winning
number
had
become
known
and,
if
their
interests
weren't
--
didn't
coincide
with
those
of
the
banker,
they
could
slip
in,
on
their
own
behalf,
winning
numbers,
and
this
could
be
quite
ruinous
to
the
banker.
it
was
testified
by
expert
witness
that
the
headquarters
personnel
usually
worked
directly
under
the
supervision
of
the
banker
or
under
the
supervision
of
one
of
the
banker's
trusted
helpers.
now,
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
ingram
and
jenkins
were
convicted
of
the
offenses
named
in
counts
2
and
3,
that
is,
the
failure
to
pay
the
special
stamp
tax
and
the
failure
to
register.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
below
indicated
that,
in
that
court,
petitioners
ingram
and
jenkins
abandoned
appeal
on
those
issues.
from
--
as
mr.
asinof
has
conceded,
the
record
very
clearly
indicates
that
rufus
--
rather,
horace
ingram
was
a
banker.
there
is
also,
we
submit,
evidence
that
rufus,
ingram
was
a
principal
of
some
sort
in
this
operation.
there
was
a
testimony
that
could
--
the
jury
could
infer
and
find,
reasonably,
that
rufus
jenkins
was
either
a
pickup
man
and,
as
a
pickup
man,
he
would
operate
as
a
writer
or
a
ribbon
man,
a
banker
laying-off
bets
with
a
horace
ingram
and
receiving
a
commission.
there
was
evidence
that,
in
1957,
horace
--
rufus
jenkins
was
under
surveillance
by
the
state
and
the
federal
officers,
that
he
was
seen
repeatedly
at
a
place
where
it
was
suspected
that
there
was
lottery,
numbers
lottery,
going
on.
that
he
was
at
this
location
once
and
noticed
the
federal
officers
and
took
flight,
that
there
was
a
chase.
some
jump
boys
who
were
diversion
boys
that
where,
for
diversionary
purposes,
jumped
out
of
the
car
and
ran.
there
was
a
chase.
after
rufus
was
caught,
there
was
no
lottery
found.
but,
subsequently,
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
in
talking
with
the
officers,
rufus
jenkins
admitted
that,
at
the
time
when
the
jump
--
boys
jumped
out
of
the
car,
they
had
left
the
bag
of
lottery
next
to
him
on
the
sit
of
--
of
his
car.
there
was
testimony
that
rufus
jenkins
was
seen
at
horace
ingram's
garage,
which
was
the
city
headquarters
for
this
lottery,
the
place
where
--
what
was
called
the
money
headquarters
where
the
money
settlements
were
made
to
the
scene
at
this
place
repeatedly,
that
he
was
seen
counting
money
with
horace
ingram,
that
there
is
also
evidence
that
he
was
referenced
on
bond
for
some
of
the
people.
there's
testimony
as
to
that.
there
was
also
testimony
that
he
had
a
--
when
he
had
gone
away
for
a
short
time,
that
he
had
turned
over
some
automobiles
that
he
used
in
his
lottery
business
to
horace
ingram,
and
horace
ingram
had
sold
the
cars
and
that
rufus
jenkins
was
upset
about
this.
now,
as
to
petitioners
smith
and
law,
they
were
only
convicted
of
the
conspiracy
offense,
the
conspiracy
to
evade
the
excise
tax
and
the
special
stamp
tax.
they
were
convicted
along
with
horace
ingram
and
rufus
jenkins
of
conspiracy.
and,
we
submit
that
the
evidence
shows
that
petitioner
smith
was
horace
ingram's
right-hand
man
in
his
operation
and
that
mary
law
was
also
a
very
important
and
knowledgeable
participant
in
this
lottery.
both
of
them
were
involved
in
the
inner
circle
of
this
lottery.
both
of
them
worked
in
the
check-up
headquarters.
now,
as
mr.
asinof
has
stated,
the
jury
clearly
was
instructed
correctly
as
to
this
court's
holding
in
calamaro
as
to
the
elements
of
conspiracy
and
that
it
could
convict
petitioners'
conspiracy
only
upon
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
evasion
of
the
federal
wagering
taxes
was
one
of
the
objectives
of
conspiracy.
there
was
abundant
direct
evidence
that
the
petitioners
and
others
conspired
together
and
were
operating
numbers
lottery
in
violation
of
state
law.
we
submit
there
is
also
evidence
from
which
the
jury
here
could
find
that
evasion
of
federal
taxes
was
also
an
objective
of
this
conspiracy.
this
was
not
a
small
fly-by-night
operation.
this
was
a
large
operation.
there
was
some
question
as
to
any
evidence
as
to
the
size.
there
is
more
than
just
the
evidence
regarding
the
statement
by
horace
ingram
that
he
had,
one
time,
been
reduced
to
$3,500
a
day.
there
was
testimony
that
a
large
operation
in
atlanta
would
usually
have
between
$2,000
to
$3,000
gross
a
day.horace
ingram
was
complaining
about
being
reduced
to
$3,500.
also,
on
the
raid
on
march
27th
1957,
on
the
horace
ingram's
garage
in
atlanta,
the
--
there
was
a
good
--
a
large
quantity
of
typical
lottery
paraphernalia
found.
this
garage
was
an
automobile
repair
garage.
there
were
large
quantities
of
brown
paper
bags
found
which
were
used
extensively
in
the
numbers
lottery
to
carry
the
tickets.
hundreds
of
these
bags
were
found.
there
were
--
there
was
a
large
quantity
of
the
three-by-five
tablets
of
paper
which
were
used
in
atlanta
to
write
the
numbers
on.
there
were
also
--
there
was
also
found
large
quantities
of
the
other
supplies
that
are
used
in
a
lottery
operation.
also,
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
--
in
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it
was
but,
in
mr.
asinof's
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
thought
he
gave
the
impression
that
the
only
evidence
of
a
large-scale
operation
was
the
$3,500.
when
the
--
in
the
raid
that
--
on
march
27th
on
the
garage
on
petitioner's
--
rather,
petitioner
horace
ingram
and
defendant
christian,
who
is
not
a
party
here
but
was
a
party
below,
there
was
a
total
of
$9,000
--
almost
$9,000
found.
there
is
also
testimony
by
one
of
the
messengers
that
was
apprehended
and
testified,
testified
that
he
worked
for
horace
ingram
in
1954,
that
he
carried
usually
between
75
and
80
bags
of
lottery
to
the
secret
rendezvous
location
with
ingram
smith.
and,
at
this
would
--
there
was
testimony
that
would
indicate
that
this
would
represent
about
75
to
80
writers,
the
--
each
bag
representing
the
tickets
from
a
writer.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
of
course
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
is
evidence
that
the
tax
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
--
was
paid.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
the
tax
was
paid.
we
believe
that
all
of
the
--
all
the
court
of
appeals
is
indicating
there
is
that
you
don't
have
to
show
in
a
conspiracy
that
they
were
successful
in
obtaining
the
objective.
however,
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
that
problem
because,
in
this
case,
there
is
testimony
by
representatives
in
the
internal
revenue
service
that
none
of
the
defendants
who
were
named
in
the
indictment
nor
any
of
the
conspirators,
at
any
time,
paid
the
excise
tax,
the
special
stamp
tax,
or
registered.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
there
was
testimony
that
none
of
--
that
no
one
did.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
we
believe
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
a
lottery
was
being
operated,
that
they
were
taking
in
money,
the
statement
about
$3,500.
there's
also
a
testimony
by
a
newspaperman
in
atlanta
who
was
surveying
--
surveilling
the
garage
there
in
atlanta,
horace's
garage,
and
he
saw
horace
and
that,
one
time,
bring
in
two
stacks
of
money
over
a
quarter
high.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
our
position
here
is
that
rufus
jenkins
and
horace
ingram
were
liable
for
the
tax
and
that
these
other
parties
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
i
think,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
you
can
have
a
conspiracy
to
evade
tax
which
isn't
successful
where
they
don't
succeed
in
evading
the
tax.
in
this
case,
we
don't
think
that
we
have
to
--
to
meet
that
because,
clearly,
there
was
a
lottery.
there
were
tax
--
there
was
evidence
that
taxes
were
not
paid.
no
--
there's
no
tax
to
pay.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
the
--
these
two
people
that
weren't
liable
for
the
tax,
as
smith
and
law,
were
not
simple
messengers.
they
were
important
persons
in
this
lottery
operation.
the
evidence
clearly
shows,
and
maybe
i
should
summarize
it,
at
this
point,
what
the
evidence
shows
as
to
smith
and
law,
because
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
the
wagering
tax.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
of
course
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
the
--
this
tax
--
the
taxes
involved
here
in
the
registration
provisions
that
a
company
that's
taxed
and
it
require
those
that
have
to
pay
the
special
tax
to
register
publicly
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
the
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
these
provisions
have
been
on
the
books
since
1951.
this
conspiracy
alleged
the
indictment
to
have
commenced
in
1954.
so,
it's
at
least
two-and-a
half
years
after
these
statutes
were
enacted.
also,
these
taxes
are
taxes
which
apply
to
this
particular
type
of
enterprise.
this
is
a
tax
that
is
limited
to
the
people
that
were
in
the
lottery
business.
now,
as
to
whether
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
no,
there
is
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
have
more
--
more
to
say
than
just
that,
your
honor.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
these
--
the
personnel
in
this
lottery
were
under
surveillance
not
only
by
the
county
officials
of
fulton
county,
alabama,
but
also
the
internal
revenue
officials,
and
that
the
internal
revenue
officials
were
apprehending
some
of
them.
now,
on
page
7
of
the
government's
brief,
the
statements,
in
the
--
there‘s
a
--
a
reference
about
the
arrest
of
walker
and
mcdowell
who
were
two
drag-men
who
were
arrested
in
1954.
mr.
robert
joiner,
the
record
shows,
was
--
accompanied
the
fulton
county
officials
in
making
that
arrest.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
yes,
i
think
we
can
infer
that.
there
was
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
was
testimony
that
both
smith
and
law
would
gather
along
with
horace
ingram
and,
at
times
--
times,
others
would
gather
at
noontime
in
devious
ways
and,
by
taking
circuitous
routes
and
evasive
driving
tactics,
would
go
out
into
the
outskirts
of
atlanta.
now,
for
--
since
--
from
--
at
various
times
from
1954
through
1957,
these
people
were
pursued
by
the
federal
officers.
they
were
under
surveillance.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
it
would
appear
from
the
record,
yes,
that
they
did
know
that
they
were
being
followed
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
--
because
the
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
from
the
tactics
that
they
took,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
the
county.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
and
there
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
other
than
the
surveillance
of
them
and
the
continual
following
of
them
by
federal
officers,
and
the
fact
that
federal
officers
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
these
--
these
people
didn't
take
the
stand
to
testify,
your
honor,
certainly
it
goes
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
that's
right.
they,
however,
were
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
they
--
they
were
personnel
in
the
lottery
operation,
and
another
personnel
were
apprehended
by
county
and
federal
officers.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
the
record
isn't
too
clear
on
that,
your
honor.
they
weren't
charged
with
a
federal
offense,
but
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
we
--
it
--
this
court
can
imply
that
these
people
who
were
important
people
in
the
inner
circle
of
this
lottery
were
aware
of
the
federal
laws
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
--
that
applied
particularly
to
this
lottery
operation.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
we
think
the
jury
could
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
--
affirm
that.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
now,
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
yes,
i
can
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
yeah.
i'll
summarize
it
as
to
mr.
smith
and
law.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
and,
this
is
a
summary,
smith
was
observed,
as
early
as
1954,
at
horace
ingram's
garage
at
around
noon
time.
and,
noon
time
--
the
horace
ingram's
garage
was
indicated
because,
clearly,
it
was
the
money
headquarters
of
this
operation.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
1951,
your
honor,
november
1951.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
what
was
that?
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
you
passed
on
it
in
1957,
june
1957.
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
these
--
these
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
smith
and
law
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
alright,
thank
you.
there
was
testimony
by
clarence
walker,
a
drag
man,
a
messenger,
for
horace
ingram
in
1954
that
he
took
75
to
85
sacks
of
lottery
a
day
to
points
outside
atlanta
and
delivered
them
to
horace
ingram
and
smith,
and
then,
would
later
come
back
to
the
same
rendezvous
and
pick
up
the
ribbons
and
take
them
back
to
atlanta.
between
1954
and
1957,
a
whole
series
of
surveillances
indicated
that
smith
regularly
met
with
horace
ingram,
mary
law
and,
sometimes,
eugene
thomas
and
mary
ingram
around
noon
time.
they'd
gather
in
their
cars
and,
by
circuitous
routes
and
evasive
tactics,
they'd
go
out
into
the
country.
they
were
followed
quite
often,
but
unsuccessfully,
by
county
and
federal
officers.
there
was
testimony
that
it
was
at
noontime
when
the
headquarters
personnel
would
gather
to
go
out
to
the
check
up
headquarters.
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
number
is
obtained
from
the
stock
market
reports
in
new
york
and
they
would
become
unknown
about
noontime.
that's
when
these
people
would
be
going
out,
and
it
was
--
they
were
repeatedly
seen.
this
group
--
this
is
one
group
gathering
together.
there
was
testimony
by
eddie
allen
who
worked
for
--
who
testified
that
he
worked
for
horace
ingram
in
1955,
that
he
delivered
lottery
tickets
to
horace
ingram,
smith,
and
mary
law
at
places
outside
the
city.
the
meeting
place,
he
testified,
was
changed
once
a
month.
in
december
of
1955,
another
employee
of
horace
ingram
was
apprehended
driving
a
truck
which
had
a
secret
compartment
in
it,
and
lottery
tickets
were
found
in
this
compartment.
while
the
truck
--
truck
was
stopped,
horace
--
horace
ingram
and
smith
came
by
and
were
pursued
but
were
not
caught.
turner
informed
investigator
carter
that
horace
ingram
would
pay
his
bond
and
fine.
this
was
the
usual
arrangement
that
was
testified
for
the
banker
to
pay
the
bonds
and
fine.
when
turner
pleaded
guilty,
smith
appeared
at
the
courthouse,
paid
turner's
$1,000
fine
and
paid
$100
attorney
fee.
in
december
1955,
smith
bought,
a
--
for
delivery
to
horace
ingram's
garage,
a
large
quantity
of
ham
and
turkey,
the
name
of
a
fictitious
purchaser.
the
payments
were
made
by
smith
and
the
police
officers
were
seen
carrying
ham
and
whiskey
that
christmas
from
horace
ingram's
garage.
in
the
afternoon
of
september
20,
1956,
smith,
mary
law,
along
with
eugene
thomas,
and
john
ingram,
were
caught
at
the
check
up
headquarters,
out
in
a
rural
county
outside
of
atlanta,
operating
the
--
a
typical
lottery
check
up
headquarters.
smith
plead
guilty
to
the
state
charge
of
lottery
and
on
his
bond,
as
a
reference,
there
appeared
the
initials
h.i.
smith
was
seen
regularly
at
the
garage
in
the
months
of
--
the
garage
there
in
atlanta
in
the
months
of
january,
february,
and
march
1957
carrying,
at
various
times,
sacks
and,
one
time,
carrying
out
an
adding
machine.
and,
in
the
march
27th
raid
--
the
evening
of
march
27th,
ingram
--
rather,
smith
was
found
there
at
the
garage
and,
on
his
person,
there
was
found
a
lottery
ribbon.
also,
smith
was
seen
giving
--
he
was
present
with
horace
ingram
when
the
two
--
rather,
when
horace
ingram
was
seen
giving
money
to
a
policeman
in
january
of
--
january
9th,
1957.
my
time
has
run
over,
your
honor.
i
can
just
briefly
state
the
--
mr.
j.
dwight
evans,
jr.
well,
there's
nothing
more
on
that
print
of
the
summary
of
smith's
activities
as
detailed
by
the
record.
now,
as
to
mary
parks
law,
she
also
was
seen,
in
1954,
at
horace
ingram's
garage,
the
city
headquarters
for
this
operation.
she,
was
--
along
with
smith,
was
seen
regularly
gathering
with
horace
ingram,
smith
and,
sometimes,
a
couple
of
others
at
noontime
and
this
group
--
going
out
to
the
country,
indulging
in
the
evasive
tactics
to
throw
off
the
law
officers
who
were
trying
to
follow
them
and
detect
the
check-up
headquarters.
as
i
indicated
before,
eddie
allen
testified
that
he
delivered
tickets
to
her,
along
with
horace
ingram
and
smith.
she
was
found
in
the
checkup
headquarters
in
1956
and,
at
time,
she
gave
a
false
name.
she
claimed
that
her
name
was
marie
ranson.
she
pleaded
guilty
to
a
state
lottery
charge
and
her
bond,
as
under
the
name
marie
ranson,
the
false
name,
and
the
bond
--
her
bond
for
this
state
charge
had
the
reference
--
has,
as
a
reference,
the
initials
h.i.
later,
after
the
detection
of
this
check0-up
headquarters,
she
was
again
seen
with
smith,
going
--
at
noontime,
going
out
into
the
outskirts
of
atlanta.
subsequent
to
the
raid
on
the
garage
on
march
27th,
mary
law
was
again
picked
up
by
john
ingram
and
eugene
thomas,
and
there
were
efforts
on
the
part
of
those
three
to
go
out
in
the
country.
at
that
time,
the
law
officers
continued
to
follow
them
even
though
they
knew
that
they
were
--
the
parties
knew
that
they
were
being
followed,
and
they
didn't
go
anywhere
at
that
time.
that,
i
believe,
is
a
summary
of
the
evidence.
thank
you
very
much.
