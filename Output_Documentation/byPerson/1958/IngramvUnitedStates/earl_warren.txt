mr.

chief

relating
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
asinof,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
they
were
employees
of
the
banker,
might
they
not
have
his
interest
in
mind
in
concealing
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they'd
have
to
read
what
is
in
a
man's
mind
when
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he's
in
an
illegal
project?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
asinof,
doesn't
--
doesn't
that
same
law
require
him
to
keep
posted
in
his
--
his
place
of
business
a
copy
that
receipt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
if
the
law
did
require
that
then
it
wasn't
done
and
those
who
are
working
with
him
in
this
illicit
project
were
trying
to
protect
his
interest,
might
--
may
not
be
protecting
him
against
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
against
detection
for
not
having
--
having
posted
in
his
place
of
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
about
whether
it
was
posted
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
either
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
evans.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
you
would
--
i
wonder
if
you
would
now
tell
us
exactly
what
evidence
there
was
against
law
and
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
that
--
that
would
bear
on
what
you're
speaking
about
now.
as
i
understood
counsel,
there's
only
one
bit
of
evidence
against
law
and
that
was
that,
at
the
time
of
the
raid
or
whenever
it
was,
she
had
in
her
possession
some
tickets.
i
understood
him
to
say
that's
the
only
thing
in
the
record.
now,
will
you
tell
me
over
and
above
that,
what
there
is
concerning
her
and
also
those
who
were
--
set
and
situated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
is
anything
more
on
bar
and
smith,
just
read
it
briefly,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
asinof.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
asinof,
as
i
see
it,
there
are
two
--
two
different
crimes
here,
of
course,
the
state
crime
and
the
federal
crime.
the
state
crime
is
only
a
misdemeanor,
but
to
conduct
the
gambling
operation
like
this
without
paying
the
--
the
tax
--
a
federal
tax
is
--
is
more
than
a
misdemeanor,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that
--
that
makes
it
a
felony.
now,
why
should
we
be
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
--
the
main
conspiracy
was
to
avoid
the
state
law,
which
was
only
a
misdemeanor,
where
it
was
just
as
essential
if
he
was
going
to
--
to
operate
the
--
the
gambling
affair
without
punishment,
that
he
must
conceal
the
fact
that
he
hadn't
paid
his
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
one
subsidiary
to
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
operation
was
as
flagrant
as
you
indicate
it
was.
it
might
well
be
that
they
were
more
afraid
of
the
federal
government
than
they
were
of
the
state
government.
