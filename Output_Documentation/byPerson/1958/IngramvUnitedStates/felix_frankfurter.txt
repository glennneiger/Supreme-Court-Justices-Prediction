how
many
were
tried
at

26.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
lawyers
for
the
defendants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
evidence
bear
on
the
profit
of
the
--
of
the
petitioners
other
than
ingram?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
their
take
was
out
of
this
profit
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
charged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
know
whether
they
got
$10
a
day
or
whether
a
sizable
share
in
the
profit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
other
testimony
was
there,
except
that
interesting
item
that
the
income,
or
was
it
the
gross,
was
reduced
to
$3,500
a
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
else
was
there
bearing
on
the
size
of
the
operation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
--
what
the
monetary
reward
of
smith,
mary
parks
law,
and
rufus
jenkins
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
the
--
the
record
is
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
they,
being
a
very
small
--
whether
they
had
a
very
small
remuneration
or
whether
they
had
a
good-for-sized
chair
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
there
anything
in
the
record
from
which
a
jury
could
barely
draw
the
inference
that
this
was
a
--
this
was
a
large-scaled
money
making
enterprise
and
that
the
three
people,
three
petitioners
here,
other
than
ingram
had
an
important
stake
in
the
profit
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
a
word,
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
other
--
was
there
any
evidence
to
indicate
the
relationship
of
those
three
that
i've
named
to
ingram
showing
that
they
were
--
that
they
must
have
been
in
the
know
both
of
what
was
going
and
what
was
done
or
what
was
not
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
deny
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
guys
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
clear
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
that,
is
it
suggested
that,
therefore,
they
must
have
known
what
ingram
was
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
one
of
your
chief
burdens
to
destroy
that
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
any
question
that,
under
the
law,
the
excise
tax
was
due?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
is
no
question
that
it
wasn't
paid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
the
effect
of
--
of
liability
for
a
nonpayment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
federal
--
of
wages
--
wages
for
the
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
if
that's
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
do
you
treat
the
two
disjunctively?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
would
--
that
would
be
proof,
certainly,
of
ingram.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
would
it
be
true
in
your
view?
would
it
follow
inferentially
that
it
would
be
true
as
to
these
other
three
even
under
state
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
--
it
was
rather
essential
in
order
to
keep
out
of
the
net
of
the
state
to
have
this
enterprise
carried
on
secretly,
illicitly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
to
make
a
disclosure
to
the
fact
that
it
was
being
carried
on.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
there
had
been
a
--
if
the
federal
law
had
been
obeyed,
ingram
would
have
to
write
--
make
a
public
statement,
in
effect,
that
“i
am
carrying
out
a
lottery,”
wouldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
being
so,
why
is
it
a
non-reasonable
inference
that
these
other
people,
no
matter
what
their
state
is
in
relation
to
his
business
was,
that
these
other
people
must
therefore
have
known
that
he
didn't
comply
with
federal
law
because
if
he
had
complied
with
federal
law,
the
goose
would
have
been
cooked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
doesn't
that
--
why
isn't
that
practical
fact
a
sufficient
basis
for
inference
by
the
jury
that
these
people
knowingly
helped
him
in
carrying
on
a
business
in
--
in
evasion
of
a
federal
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
an
agreement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
true.
they
could
not
be
convicted.
it
could
not
--
they
could
not
permit
the
substantive
federal
offense.
well,
then,
they
were
not
within
its
purview,
but
does
that
mean
they
couldn't
have
conspired
with
him
that
he
should
evade
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
his
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
the
evidence
is
derived
from
the
fact
that
they
--
that
they
helped
him
to
carry
on
a
business.
they
helped
him
to
carry
on
a
business
in
disobedience
to
the
federal
duty
to
make
a
disclosure
and
pay
a
tax,
and
they
knew
that
they
were
helping
consciously
to
help
him
evade
the
federal
law
because
it
requires
just
less
than
moronic
intelligence
to
know
he
couldn't
have
made
the
disclosure
without,
as
i
say,
putting
it
onto
his
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
not
have
paid
his
tax
and
registered
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
not
come
--
not
an
unfair
practice
if
it
were
to
the
state
authorities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
difficult
for
them,
if
he
actually
--
if
he
actually
registered?
just
what
is
the
process?
where
would
he
be
doing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
atlanta,
and
wouldn't
that
be
accessible
to
the
state
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
an
awfully
big
jump?
is
it
too
big
a
jump?
that's
the
real
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
too
big
a
jump
that
that
is
as
much
evidence
as
though
he
had
told
these
fellows
“now,
you
want
to
keep
--
be
very
careful
because
i
don't
want
to
get
in
trouble
with
the
federal
authorities”?
suppose
there
is
evidence
to
that
extent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
have
been
a
conspiracy,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
although
they
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
the
substantive
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
are
they
saying
“be
very
careful
because
i
see
that
i
don't
get
in
the
clutches
of
the
federal
law”
if
he,
in
effect,
--
in
effect,
told
them
that,
by
their
knowledge
--
inevitable
knowledge
that
he'd
be
--
did
make
a
disclosure
to
the
district
or
--
what
is
he
called?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
director
in
atlanta,
the
state
authority
would
be
wise
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
suggested
the
difference
between
a
department
store
and
this
because
a
department
store
owner
isn't
under
an
almost
inherent
compulsion
or
temptation,
to
put
it
mildly,
not
to
pay.
that
isn't
true
of
a
--
that
isn't
true
of
--
in
carrying
on
any
legitimate
business.
the
fact
of
the
illicit
cashing
of
the
business,
under
georgia
law,
gives
important
proof
that
he
doesn't
want
to
give
the
publicity
that
he
would
be
afforded
by
the
state
authorities
if
he
did
comply
with
the
federal
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
separate
offense,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
post?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
punishment
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
admit
that
it
is?
can't
there
be
a
conspiracy
to
evade
taxes
that
are
not
due
or
not
paid
because
--
and
because
it's
a
conspiracy
in
1959
to
evade
taxes
due
and
payable
in
1960?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
i
am
asking
you.
do
you
think
it
is
necessary
that
a
conspiracy
to
--
for
the
evasion
of
these
wagering
taxes
that
involve
--
should
relate
to
taxes
that
are
due
and
payable
and
have
not
been
paid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
anymore
in
a
conspiracy
to
murder
means
that
there
must
have
been
a
murder?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
difficulty
with
your
case
is
very
different.
my
difficulty
is
that
the
only
places
on
which
you
can
--
on
which
in
this
case,
as
i
see
it,
a
conviction
for
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
--
of
people
who
are
not
liable
substantively
under
the
act,
a
charge
for
conspiring
with
the
man
who
was
is
that
from
the
mere
fact
of
their
employment
in
being
certainly
subsidiary
position
with
a
money
interest
in
relation
to
the
enterprise
that
is,
as
to
which
there
is
no
evidence,
from
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
employed
in
this
enterprise,
the
jury
was
allowed
to
infer
and
the
judgment
must
be
sustained
that
they
conspired,
cooperated,
collaborated,
actively
were
engaged
in
a
partnership
with
him
for
the
nonpayment
of
that
tax
because,
presumably,
they
knew
(a)
that
a
tax
had
to
be
paid
and
(b)
that
he
wasn't
going
to
pay
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
before
you
do
that,
people
may
be
important
and
even
indispensable.
a
man
may
have
just
as
a
fellow
who
beats
--
just
gives
one
beat
to
a
drum
in
a
long
symphony
may
be
indispensable,
but
it
doesn't
follow
that,
therefore,
he
knows
what
everybody
else
in
the
enterprise
says
they
do.
was
there
any
evidence
in
this
case,
anything
brought
home
to
these
nontaxable
people,
that
the
taxes
--
that
there
such
a
thing
as
federal
taxes
and
there's
a
duty
to
pay
them,
and
that
ingram
was
not
going
to
carry
out
that
duty,
was
there
a
conscious
cooperation
other
than
the
fact
that
this
was
a
lottery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
what
they
asked
--
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
--
any
evidence
that
some
had
the
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
such
a
--
of
the
wagering
--
what's
--
what's
the
act
called,
technically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
wagering
tax
act,
was
there
any
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
such
a
federal
statute
brought
over
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
would
you
say
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
must
be
presumed
that
they
knew
there
was
such
a
statute?
i
take
no
stop
in
such
a
fictitious
assumption
that
people
know
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
all
the
law
that
a
man
is
supposed
to
know
that
i
don't
know,
i
don't
see
why
i
should
attribute
knowledge
to
laymen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
ingram.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
trouble
with
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
if
i
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
was
a
--
a
newspaper
campaign
that
the
atlanta
constitution
printed
a
lot
of
stuff
showing
how
the
--
the
federal
tax
was
being
evaded
and
that
that
take
away
the
executive,
anything
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you're
saying
is
that
these
people
couldn't
have
been
so
interested
as
not
to
know
there
was
such
a
law.
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
--
does
it
also
show
that
--
that
these
three
people
knew
that
the
federal
authorities
were
at
their
heels.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
you're
inferring
on
--
inferring
on
inferences.
i
mean,
that
my
trouble
with
the
case.
justice

to
their
knowledge?
justice
felix

how
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
it
appear
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
they
might
be
escaping
the
local
police
or
the
state
police.
have
you
got
state
police
on

in
georgia,
whatever
they've
got?
justice

the

justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is,
after
all,
a
criminal
case
and
people
are
going
to
jail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
is
such
a
thing
as
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
--
which
its
knowledge
has
not
been
brought
home
to
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
by
your
inference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
entitled
not
to.
i
mean,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
make
it
your
case
out
of
their
mouths,
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
know
that
they
were
apprehended
by
federal
officers
or
did
they
merely
know
they
were
apprehended?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
isn't
with
you,
mr.
evans,
the
trouble
is
with
your
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
the
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
case.
that's
what
i
meant
to
put
to
you
a
little
while
ago.
the
case
is
that
an
operation
of
this
magnitude
carried
on
for
so
long
of
continuous
period
in
which
these
people
played
an
important
role,
support
sufficient
basis
for
allowing
the
jury
to
infer
that
they
knew,
in
the
first,
the
requirements
of
the
federal
law
and
that,
from
that
knowledge
and
their
share
in
the
enterprise,
presumably,
that
in
the
requisites
of
criminal
prosecution,
they
actively
--
what
they
did
and
what
they
failed
to
do
falls
with
the
active
conscious
planning
with
mr.
ingram.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
case,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
we
finally
pass
on
it,
mr.
evans?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
we
pass
on
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
slows
it
down
for
delay,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
let
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
divert
you
from
the
chief
justice's
question.
