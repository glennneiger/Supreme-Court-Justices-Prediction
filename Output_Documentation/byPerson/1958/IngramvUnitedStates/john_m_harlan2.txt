was
there
any
proof
in
the
record
to
the
tax
was
due?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
one
of
the
facts
that
brought
this
establishment
up
under
georgia
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean,
as
a
matter
of
permissible
inferences
that
a
jury
could
draw
from
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
might
make
a
distinction
between
the
so-called
banker
running
in
that
respect.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
could
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
saying,
as
to
the
conspiracy
to
evade
tax,
was
a
gambling
tax?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove,
in
connection
with
that
charge,
either
that
a
tax
was
due
or
that
the
tax
had
not
been
paid?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
read
you
brief
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
pickup
man
didn't
have
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
my
question
to
you
is
can
you
hold
the
pickup
man
on
the
theory
that
they
were
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
evade
taxes,
meaning
the
banker's
taxes,
without
proof
that
it
--
there
is
some
proof
that
a
tax
was
due
and
that
it
was
not
paid.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
sustain
the
conviction,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
on
that
ground.
the
charge
was,
as
you
have
--
as
you
have
vindicated,
namely,
that
they
could
infer
from
this
evidence
that
the
tax
had
not
been
paid,
and
so
forth.
but,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
uphold
it
on
that
ground
and,
as
i
see
it,
they
never
evaluated
the
record
in
terms
of
that
being
an
essential
part
of
the
government's
case.
