justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
asinof,
if
i
may,
may
i
--
i
just
want
to
clear.
do
you
question
the
accuracy
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury
given
by
the
trial
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
the
evidence
was
sufficient,
do
you
think
the
instructions
were
inaccurate
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
statement
of
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
you
did
not?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
it
conceded
by
the
petitioners
that
the
evidence
was
very
clear
to
support
a
finding
that
there
was
a
large-scale
numbers
operation
going
on
and
--
and
an
effort
on
--
by
all
parties
concerned
in
it
to
conceal
it?
isn't
that
all
conceded
here?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
when
was
this
federal
statute
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
say,
mr.
asinof,
that,
at
most,
what
the
evidence
shows
here
is
a
conspiracy
which
is
subsidiary
to
a
subsidiary
conspiracy?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
that
the
basic
conspiracy
was
to
operate
an
illegal
lottery,
illegal
under
the
laws
of
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
a
subsidiary
to
that
conspiracy
was
to
conceal
the
operation
of
that
illegal
activity,
and
that
illegal
conspiracy,
and
necessary
to
that
subsidiary
concealment
conspiracy
was
not
to
pay
the
federal
tax.
