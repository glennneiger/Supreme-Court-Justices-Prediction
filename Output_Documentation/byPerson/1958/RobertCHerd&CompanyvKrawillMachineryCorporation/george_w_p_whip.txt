mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
robert
c.
herd
&
company,
a
contracting
stevedore
doing
business
in
baltimore,
maryland.
the
respondents
were
shippers
of
certain
cases
or
packages
of
the
machinery
parts
from
baltimore
to
valencia,
spain.
the
facts
are
substantially
as
follows.pursuant
to
contracts
of
carriage,
the
evidence
by
bills
of
lading
which
were
prepared
by
representatives
of
the
krawill
machinery
corporation
and
associates
which
were
accepted
by
the
master
and
the
general
agents
of
the
steamship
castillo
ampudia,
whereby,
the
owners
of
the
castillo
ampudia
agree
to
carry
certain
packages
or
cases
of
machinery
parts
from
baltimore
to
valencia
on
its
steamship,
castillo
ampudia.
the
general
agents
of
the
steamship
company
employed
the
petitioner
to
load
the
shipment.
it
was
determined
that
the
equipment
of
the
--
loading
equipment
of
the
vessel
was
too
late
to
lift
these
cases.
so,
the
petitioner
employed
a
floating
derrick
from
the
bethlehem
steel
company
for
that
purpose.
and
on
april
the
14th,
1954,
while
loading
was
in
progress,
one
of
these
cases
slipped
from
the
slings
as
it
was
being
hoisted
and
fell
into
the
water
which
caused
considerable
damage
to
its
contents.
now
the
shippers,
instead
of
filing
a
libel
against
the
vessel
or
proceeding
against
the
owner
in
admiralty
as
was
usual
in
such
cases,
filed
an
action
at
law,
at
common
law
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland
against
the
bethlehem
steel
company
as
owner
of
the
derrick,
and
petitioner
as
the
contracting
stevedore.
and
at
the
trial
without
a
jury,
judge
thompson
of
the
district
court
held
bethlehem
steel
company
free
of
fault.
the
petitioner
is
solely
at
fault.
and
it
refused
to
allow
the
petitioner
to
benefit
from
the
limitation-of-liability
provisions
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
or
by
the
provisions
of
the
contracts
of
carriage
as
evidenced
by
the
bills
of
lading.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed.
then,
both
courts,
the
district
and
the
court
of
appeals
held,
that
because
neither
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
nor
the
contracts
of
carriage
as
evidenced
by
the
bills
of
lading
mentioned
stevedores,
that
stevedores
were
strangers
to
the
contract
of
carry
--
contracts
of
carriage
and
that
therefore,
they
could
obtain
no
rights
either
under
the
terms
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
or
under
the
terms
of
the
contracts
of
carriages
evidenced
by
the
bills
of
lading.
now,
let
us
look
for
a
minute
at
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
was
passed
by
congress
in
1936
to
regulate
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
from
and
to
american
ports
in
foreign
trade.
it
provided
among
other
things
that
a
carrier
should
include
an
owner
and
the
charter
of
the
steamship
or
of
a
vessel.
it
provided
further
that
the
term
carriage
of
contract
applies
only
to
contracts
of
carriage
covered
by
a
bill
of
lading
or
any
similar
document
of
title
and
so
forth
as
such
document
relates
to
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea.
it
then
provided
that
the
term
“carriage
of
goods”
covers
the
time
from
the
time
when
the
goods
are
loaded
on
to
the
time
when
they
are
discharged
from
the
vessel.
and
then
it
put
the
burden
upon
the
shipowner
to
load,
stall,
care
for,
and
discharge
the
goods'
care.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
it
didn't
say
from
tackle
to
tackle.
the
--
the
term
“carriage
of
goods”
covers
the
period
from
the
time
when
the
goods
are
loaded
on
until
the
time
when
they
are
discharged
from
the
ship.
now,
as
to
that
provision
however,
the
american
courts
at
least
have
very
generally
held
that
the
carriage
of
goods
act
comes
into
play
when
the
tackle
of
the
ship
or
it's
a
substitute
for
the
ship,
hooks
on
to
the
cargo
in
preparation
of
the
loading
or
after
they
hook
on
while
the
loading
--
the
lift
is
being
hoisted
and
remain
so
until
the
tackle
let's
go
of
the
cargo
after
this
is
discharged.
but
aside
from
that
the
--
as
i've
just
stated,
the
act
puts
burden
upon
the
carrier
to
load,
properly
load
and
carefully
load,
handle,
store,
care,
keep,
care
for,
and
discharge
the
goods
carried.
and
then
in
section
4,
i
think,
of
the
act
1304,
it
is
provided
that
the
carrier
is
only
liable
not
exceeding
the
sum
of
$500
per
package
in
case
of
loss
or
damage.
unless
there
are
some
circumstances
of
which
we
are
not
concerned
here.
and
then
it
also
provides
that
the
carrier
might
agree
or
stipulate
that
during
the
time
before
loading
takes
place
or
before
the
time
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
takes
effect
and
after
the
time
loading
is
discharged
while
the
goods
are
still
in
the
carrier's
custody
that
the
carrier
might
stipulate
and
agree
as
to
what
his
liability
will
be
during
those
times
before
and
after
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
is
effective.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
contracts
of
carriage
as
evidenced
by
the
bills
of
lading
also
prescribed
that
if
there
was
fault,
if
there
was
damage
or
liability,
the
carrier's
liability
should
not
exceed
$500
per
package.
so,
we
have
practically
the
same
limitation
provision
into
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
in
the
bills
of
lading.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
and
only
by
stating
what
they
are,
yes
i
did,
this
act
had
fallen
--
fallen.
now,
this
old
question
if
your
honor
please
in
these
cases
whether
or
not
that
contract
in
stevedore,
an
expert
stevedore
has
the
right
to
benefit
from
these
limitation
provisions
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
also
in
contracts
of
carriage
as
evidenced
from
bills
of
lading.
now,
certainly
when
the
act
was
passed
in
1936,
it
was
well-known
that
the
crew
of
the
vessel
which
in
former
times,
loaded
and
discharged
cargos
could
not
do
that
anymore.
it
was
well-known
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
do
it
and
it
was
well-known
that
they
did
not
do
it.
and
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
seas
shipping
company
versus
sieracki
has
recognized
that
the
shipowner
has
the
right
to
conduct
his
business
by
securing
the
advantages
of
specialization
in
labor
and
skill
brought
about
by
modern
divisions
of
labors
such
as
employing
stevedores.
so
therefore,
we
contend
if
your
honor
please,
that
when
this
act
was
passed,
the
real
purpose
of
it
was
to
say
to
a
carrier,
“now
here,
these
are
the
things
you
must
do.
you
will
be
liable
for
certain
things.
you
will
be
liable
for
$500
per
package
unless
there
are
particular
circumstances
which
we
are
not
concerned
here
now.
now,
we
know
--
we
know
that
you
must
employ
agents
to
do
a
great
deal
of
this
work
such
as
loading
and
discharging.
but
it
is
up
to
you,
you
will
be
held
responsible.”
now
therefore,
we
maintain,
if
your
honor,
please,
that
when
the
petitioner
was
loading
this
cargo
of
this
ship,
he
was
doing
it.
it
was
doing
it
in
furtherance
of
the
terms
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
in
furtherance
of
the
terms
of
the
contracts
of
carriage
as
evidenced
by
the
bills
of
lading.
and
we
believe
therefore,
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
benefit
by
the
terms
of
the
act
and
by
the
terms
of
the
contract.
now,
if
they're
not
so
allowed,
it
does
occur
to
us
that
the
shippers
certainly
will
be
getting
something
they
did
not
bargain
for.
in
other
words,
they
would
be
obtaining
a
windfall.
and
they
didn't
bargain
for
it.
they're
getting
--
they
were
--
they
--
they
represented,
the
cargo
was
worth
$500
per
package.
they've
paid
freight
on
it
and
they're
getting
--
if
they
get
more
than
$500
per
package,
they're
getting
more
than
they
bargained
for,
more
than
the
statute
authorized,
and
more
than
the
statute
contemplated.
now
this
case
was
up
by
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
--
a
similar
case
was
up
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
1952.
certiorari
was
denied
in
that
case.
that's
a
case
of
a.m.
collins
&
company
and
panama
railroad
company.
in
that
case,
the
steamship
company
employed
the
panama
railroad
company
as
a
stevedore
to
discharge
some
freezer
units
and
discharged
with
them
--
one
them
was
dropped
and
damaged.
the
panama
railroad
company
was
sued
by
the
owner
of
the
freezer
unit
and
claimed,
of
course,
that
the
--
the
panama
railroad
company
could
not
benefit
either
from
the
--
by
the
limitation
provisions
either
from
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
or
the
provision
--
the
similar
provision
in
the
bill
of
lading
which
controlled
that
shipment.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
otherwise.
it
was
by
a
divided
court.
but
circuit
judge
rives
wrote
a
very
good
opinion
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
it
was
known
--
it
must
have
been
known
when
this
act
was
passed,
that
this
loading
and
discharging
was
done
by
expert
stevedores
and
while
they
were
not
strictly
parties
to
it,
they
were
parties
to
this
extent
that
they
were
doing
what
the
owner
was
compelled
to
do
and
doing
what
the
owner
--
and
--
and
doing
what
was
necessary
in
furtherance
of
--
in
furtherance
of
carrying
out
the
terms
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
the
contracts
of
carriers.
now,
that
case
has
been
followed
and
approved
by
the
second
circuit
and
by
many
lower
courts
and
stood
including
this
--
including
federal
and
state,
including
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york.
the
only
united
states
court,
as
i
know
of,
and
only
one
i
can
find
out
that
refused
to
follow
the
collins
decision
was
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
the
case
of
international
milling
company
versus
nicholson
transit
company.
in
that
case,
it
seems
like
the
master
of
the
steamship
was
sued
for
some
damage
which
occurred
in
the
collision
and
the
master
set
up
as
a
defense,
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
and
the
--
that
court
--
the
michigan
court
held
that
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
terms
of
the
act.
he
had
no
rights
under
it
and
in
so
deciding,
it
cited
judge
thompson's
opinion,
in
the
district
court
and
--
and
the
--
the
dissenting
opinion
of
circuit
judge
holmes
in
the
collins
case.
that's
all
the
authority
he
had
for
it.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
yes.
he
cited
--
you
see,
this
--
this
hadn't
gone
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
hadn't
been
decided
by
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
that
time.
so,
the
michigan
court
merely
cited
judge
thompson's
opinion
in
this
case,
and
judge
holmes'
opinion,
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
collins
case
and
held
that
he
would
not
follow
the
majority
opinion
in
the
collins
case.
well,
as
i
say
this
collins
decision
has
been
approved
and
followed
by
the
second
circuit
and
by
many
other
cases
and
the
only
one
which
--
which
has
not
approved
it
is
this
michigan
case.
now,
if
your
honor,
please,
in
the
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
affirming
cited
not
only
--
not
only
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
holmes
but
also
the
majority
opinions
in
the
case
of
wilson
versus
darling
island
stevedoring
&
lighterage
co.,
ltd.,
which
was
decided
by
the
high
court
of
australia.
now
there
were
two
dissenting
opinions
in
that
case.
that
case,
the
court
of
new
south
wales
was
reversed
in
that
wilson
case
by
the
high
court
of
australia
by
three
votes
to
two.
the
two
--
there
were
two
very
good
dissenting
opinions
but
went
--
went
right
along
with
the
reasoning
of
judge
rives
in
the
collins
case.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
dissenting
justices
cited
the
collins
case.
we
believe
therefore
that
those
dissenting
opinions
are
more
in
accord
with
what
the
law
is
and
what
it
ought
to
be
than
the
majority
opinion
because
the
majority
opinions
take
right
up
and
are
based
or
solely
on
the
proposition
that
the
stevedores
could
not
possibly
have
any
rights
because
they
were
strangers
to
the
contract
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference
to
them
whether
there
was
a
contract
or
not,
or
if
there
was
a
contract
with
the
contract
provided
for.
we
believe
therefore,
your
honors
please,
that
the
dissenting
opinions
in
this
wilson
case
is
certainly
are
more
reasonable
than
the
majority
opinion
because
certainly,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
not
any
stranger
to
this
contract.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
signed
the
bills
of
lading
itself,
pursuant
to
the
authority
and
instructions
of
the
master
of
the
vessel.
so,
when
he
was
working,
the
petitioner
was
working
pursuant
to
the
bills
of
lading.
now,
there
is
one
case
where
the
other
side
and
also
judge
holmes
in
his
dissenting
opinion
relied
upon.
and
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court
rendered
in
1916,
reid
versus
the
american
express
company.
now,
in
that
case,
judge
--
judge
rives
and
his
majority
opinion
in
the
collins
case
dealt
with
it
and
he
pointed
out
that
it
is
true
that
in
the
reid
case,
of
course,
it
was
decided
long
before
there
was
a
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
but
further
than
that,
the
--
the
stevedore
in
the
reid
case
never
claimed
there
was
a
limitation
of
liability
in
the
bill
of
lading.
the
stevedore,
the
expert
or
contracting
stevedore
whom
the
shipowner
had
employed
to
do
the
loading
or
discharging
never
claimed
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
limitation.
so,
the
question
never
was
before
this
court.
and
judge
rives
--
and
judge
rives
has
pointed
that
out
very,
very
clearly.
but
further
than
that,
there
wasn't
any
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act,
then.
the
bills
of
lading
in
this
case
were
executed
and
is
authorized
by
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
and
before
right
in,
the
limitation
in
the
bills
of
lading
were
authorized
by
the
terms
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
well,
i'd
say
it's
limited.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
well,
only
to
this
--
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
well,
i
think
the
bill
--
the
section
--
subdivision
(b)
of
section
301
says
this,
“the
term
contract
of
carriage
applies
only
to
contracts
of
carriage
covered
by
a
bill
of
lading
or
any
similar
document
title
insofar
as
such
document
relate
to
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea.”
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
well,
it
would
seem
so.
and
then
the
other
--
the
other
provision
where
i
referred
to
as
being
authorized,
it
is
the
provision
of
section
1307
which
specifically
permits
the
carrier
to
stipulate
what
its
liability
will
be
prior
to
it
going
into
effect
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
after
the
goods
had
been
discharged.
now,
that's
what
i
referred
to
as
being
authorized.
i
say
that
the
carrier
has
been
authorized
by
the
act
to
put
that
limitation
in
this
bill
of
lading.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
that's
true.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
yes
sir.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
yes
sir.
of
course,
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
applies
of
its
own
force
during
the
times
after
loading
has
taken
place
and
before
discharging.
now
the
question
as
to
when
the
loading
takes
place,
the
american
cases
say
from
tackle
to
tackle.
now
judge
thompson
tried
to
make
a
distinction.
he
said,
“true,
the
package
fell
out
the
sling
after
it
was
being
lifted
or
in
preparation
of
lifting
but
they
were
merely
preparing
to
load.”
now
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
wouldn't
touch
that
question,
said
it
wasn't
necessary.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
either
because
the
collins
case
decided
on
the
bill
of
lading,
the
wilson
case
was
decided
on
the
bill
of
lading.
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
we
have
the
limitation
of
liability
in
both
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
the
bill
of
lading.
and
they're
practically
the
same.
so,
i
don't
see
that
makes
any
difference
whether
the
act
applied
of
its
own
force
or
not.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
none
whatever,
either
by
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
or
the
limitation
--
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
--
of
the
bill
of
lading,
none
whatever.
now,
getting
back
again
to
the
reason
the
district
court
and
this
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
petitioner
had
no
rights
either
under
the
act
or
the
bill
of
lading
which
was
that
he
wasn't
mentioned
in
neither
one.
now
that
--
that
isn't
a
good
reason.
this
court
has
held
both
in
seas
shipping
company
versus
sieracki
and
in
international
stevedoring
company
versus
haverty,
that
the
jones
act,
the
seamen's
act
which
applies
only
to
seamen
shall
be
applied
to
stevedores.
in
other
words,
this
court
has
held
in
those
two
cases
anyway
that
stevedores
because
they
formally
did
the
work
of
seamen
should
be
given
the
rights
of
the
jones
act
although
the
jones
act
does
not
mention
them
anywhere
in
it.
and
as
i
believe
the
reason
of
the
court
is
that
not
only
because
they
are
doing
the
work
that
seaman
pointed
in
but
that
congress
knew
at
the
time
they
passed
the
act
that
the
stevedoring
work
was
being
done
by
outside
people.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
i
realized
that,
your
honor
was
thinking
--
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
that's
the
answer
--
that
--
that
argument
is
being
made
in
this
case
by
the
other
side?
you
heard
any
doubt
about
it
and
the
--
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
--
only
answer
--
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
--
i
can
--
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
yes.
my
answer
is,
i
refer
to
these
two
cases
by
this
court,
seas
shipping
company
versus
sieracki
and
international
stevedoring
company
versus
haverty.
now,
i
think
the
same
argument
was
made
in
those
cases
that
if
the
congress
meant
for
the
seamen's
act
to
be
applied
to
stevedoring,
why
didn't
they
say
so?
but
they
didn't.
and
as
i
recall
it,
this
court
held
that
the
seamen's
act,
that
the
stevedores
should
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
seamen's
act
because
congress
must
have
known
that
this
work
was
being
done
by
stevedores
and
that
they
were
--
further
than
that,
they
were
doing
the
work
which
was
formally
done
by
crew
members.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
that's
true.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
i
think
under
the
congress'
decision,
he
should
and
only
with
international
versus
haverty
and
sea
shipping
versus
sieracki,
i
think
he
should
be
allowed
the
limit.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
i
think
anybody
who
--
who
did
that
work,
that
the
carrier
was
called
upon
to
duty,
any
of
his
agents
who
did
that
work
should
be
entitled
to
this
limitation.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
i
believe
so.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
i
believe
so.
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
i
think
--
mr.
george
w.
p.
whip
i
think
it
was
and
i
refer
you
to
a
court
of
appeals,
a
new
york
court
of
appeals
case.
i
have
it
in
here
in
my
brief
on
page
12,
berger
versus
34th
street
garage.
now,
that
isn't
exactly
the
same
situation,
if
your
honor
please,
that
you
set
forth,
but
it's
very
similar
and
the
principle
is
the
same.
because
in
that
case,
the
truck
driver
--
there
was
a
truck
driver
and
he
left
the
place
overnight
and
somebody's
robbed
and
he
was
sued
for
it
and
he
set
up
his
limitations,
the
same
limitation
that
the
steamship
company
or
the
--
somebody
else
had
in
the
court
and
it
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
they
cited
the
collins
case
and
said
that
he
was
entitled
to
that
limitations,
too.
now,
that's
the
latest
state
court
case
i
have
on
it.
and
i
have
several
other
cases
in
my
brief
on
pages
--
pages
12
to
13.
i
only
have
two
that
are
somewhat
similar
situation
that
if
you
went
out
where
the
--
the
one
who
was
performing
the
work
was
allowed
their
rights
to
limit.
and
i
think
many
other
cases
along
those
lines.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
submit
to
your
honor
please,
that
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
petitioner's
liability
should
be
limited
to
the
sum
of
$500.
