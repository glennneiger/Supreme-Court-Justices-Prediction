would
you
be
good
enough
to
spell
out
a
little
bit
what
is
meant
by
“authorized
by
the
goods
of
carriage
by
sea
act”
if
the
bills
of
lading
were
authorized?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
part
--
what
is
the
connection
between
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
goods
of
carriage
by
sea
act
and
to
making
out
of
the
particular
bill
of
lading
as
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
hence
there
must
be
a
bill
of
lading
in
order
to
have
the
goods
of
carriage
act
to
come
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
carrier
him
--
itself.
this
is
an
authorization
of
the
carrier
to
limit
his
liability
through
the
bill
of
lading
outside
of
the
territory
covered
by
the
goods
of
carriage
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
draw
from
that
the
inference
that
broaden,
that
is,
that
the
bill
of
lading
is
a
recognized
mode
of
doing
this
international
trade
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
fellow
who
carriers
what
used
to
be
the
carrier's
function
is
as
it
were
in
loco
of
the
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
--
if
assuming
the
unusual
situation.
if
the
carrier
himself
had
done
the
loading
in
this
case
and
the
--
and
the
event
had
taken
place
the
way
it
did
take
place.
the
casket
or
whatever
fell
out
of
the
sling,
is
there
any
controversies
of
the
carrier
himself
would
be
covered
by
the
carriage
of
goods
by
the
sea
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
bill
of
lading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
that
knowledge
with
the
right
be
attributed
to
congress
if
--
if
i
may
say
so,
a
double-edged
sword
because
it
might
well
be
argued
if
congress
knew
that
--
since
congress
knew
that,
why
didn't
they
put
things
--
put
the
stevedore
in
explicitly
and
why
do
you
have
to
go
about
this
argumentatively
of
saying
since
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
jones
act,
crew
business,
and
it
should
also
be
crew
business
in
the
purpose
of
this
carriage
of
property
by
a
sea
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what's
the
answer?
what's
your
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
can
exempt
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
grimes,
i'm
surprised
you
use
such
strong
language
as
outrage
because
you
could
not
have
been
unfamiliar
with
the
english
law
which
--
had
also
outrages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
australian
case
but
i'm
talking
about
the
english
cases.in
particular
law,
it
has
discrepancies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
forgot
to
tell
you
what
a
waging
fellow
here
in
the
admiralty
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
just
say
that
outrage
seems
to
be
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
eastern
baltimore
practices,
mr.
grimes,
are
there
limitations
expressly
on
behalf
of
the
stevedore?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
another
--
there's
another
one
of
those
argument
that
looks
both
ways.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
mean
that
the
determination
of
the
rate
but
the
fact
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
no
specific
limitation
on
behalf
of
the
stevedore.
i
could
argue
either
side
of
the
significance
of
that
accident.
so,
for
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
i
--
i
(inaudible)
determine
that
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
thing
that's
clear
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
one
thing
that's
clear
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
that
--
you
start
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
congress
didn't
say
anything
about
sieracki
and
this
court
didn't
say
anything
until
pretty
lately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
all
derivative.
that
was
all
derivative
derived
from
the
situation,
wasn't
it?
