on
the
time
they
loaded
it
from
or
from

to

justice

i
understood
you
to
say
that
--
excuse
me
--
had
the
ship
been
doing
its
own
stevedoring,
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
its
liability
for
this
casualty
would
be
limited
to
the
$500.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
my
question.
suppose
that
the
shipper
here
sued
the
individual
employee
of
the
ship
who
negligently
caused
this
casualty,
what
then
would
be
your
answer
as
to
whether
that
employee
would
be
entitled
to
a
like
limitation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
employee
then
stands
in
the
same
position
you
--
as
you
argued
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
stevedore,
independent
contractor.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
let
me
i
ask
you
one
more
hypothetical.
let's
take
a
truck
driver
who
is
driving
a
truck,
hauling
--
as
a
common
carrier,
working
for
an
employer
hauling
cargo
and
that
there's
a
limitation
of
the
carrier's
liability.
but
the
truck
driver
negligently
drives
the
truck
in
front
of
that
--
an
approaching
train
and
the
cargo
was
damaged.
now,
both
are
liable,
aren't
they?
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
truck
company
and
the
truck
driver.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
would
the
truck
driver
in
that
case
have
a
privilege
of
the
carrier's
immunity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
limitation?
