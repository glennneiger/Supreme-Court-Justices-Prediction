mr.
william
a.
grimes
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
is
asking
this
court
to
rule
that
the
loss
suffered
by
the
respondents
as
a
result
of
the
negligence
and
a
practically
self-admitted
negligence
of
an
independent
contractor
should
cost
the
respondents
or
should
entitle
the
respondents
to
recover
only
2%
of
the
damage
that
they
have
sustained.
in
asking
your
honors
to
adopt
the
rule
of
that
sort,
they
necessarily
rely
on
the
collins
case
to
which
mr.
whip
has
adverted,
a
two-to-one
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
they
ask
your
honors
necessarily
to
overrule
the
reasoning
of
two
very
able
judges
who
considered
this
case
in
extenso.
both
judge
thompson
and
chief
judge
thompson
in
the
district
court
and
chief
judge
sobeloff
in
the
fourth
circuit
speaking
for
himself,
where
judge
soper
and
for
judge
haynsworth.
now,
we
think
that
almost
the
very
statement
on
the
proposition
is
enough
to
show
that
there
is
no
merit
in
the
petitioner's
contention.
the
facts
are
substantially
undisputed.
there
were
one
or
two
that
mr.
whip
did
not
mention
which
i
think
have
some
minor
bearing
on
the
case,
namely,
that
the
stevedore
here
did
not
have
any
contract,
any
written
contract
governing
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
it
performed
the
work
for
the
vessel.
it
operated
pursuant
to
an
oral
agreement.
nowhere
did
it
provide
in
that
contract
or
in
any
contract
because
it
had
none
with
the
shipper.
in
no
case
did
it
have
any
provision
that
its
liability
should
be
limited
in
anyway.
in
fact
it
is
clearly
set
forth
in
a
stipulation
of
this
case
which
is
referred
to
both
by
the
district
court
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
stevedore's
rates
were
entirely
independent
of
the
value
of
the
cargo.
they
would
have
received
just
as
much
for
a
cargo
that
was
valued
at
$100,000
as
they
would
for
one
which
was
valued
at
--
not
valued
at
all
in
which
case
the
act
would
impose
a
$500
limitation
so
far
as
the
carrier
and
the
shipper
were
concerned
but
not
so
far,
we
contend,
as
anyone
else
was
involved.
now,
mr.
whip
inadvertently
told
your
honors
that
there
was
a
representation
in
this
case
that
this
cargo
was
worth
only
$500.
there
wasn't
any
representation
at
all.
it
is
true
that
there
was
no
statement
that
it
was
worth
more
and
no
higher
rate
pay
so
that
if
the
shipper
had
--
had
to
sue
the
carrier
for
loss,
say
occurring
at
sea
and
clearly
within
the
coverage
to
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act,
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
right
of
recovery
would
have
been
limited
to
$500
per
package
or
per
customary
freight
unit.
and
that
may
also
be
a
question
which
was
never
reached
in
this
case,
whether
this
wasn't
--
more
than
just
a
package
because
it
was
a
great
big
crate
containing
a
19-ton
press.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
so
far
--
so
far
as
the
shippers
were
concerned
there
was
no
representation
as
to
value
and
concededly
they
could
have
recovered
from
the
--
from
the
carrier
for
--
a
loss
occurring
during
the
period
of
cogsa
coverage,
and
i
speak
of
cogsa
as
referring
to
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
which
is
--
where
it
is
commonly
and
generally
called
phonetically.
during
that
period
of
coverage,
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
while
the
carrier
they
could
have
recovered
only
$500
as
far
as
somebody
else
was
concerned
that
wouldn't
be
true.
for
instance,
if
the
vessel
had
been
in
collision
with
another
vessel,
they
could
have
recovered
their
full
damages
from
the
other
vessel
had
it
been
at
fault.
now,
it
is
true
also
as
mr.
whip
said
that
the
petitioner
here
was
not
only
the
stevedore
but
also
signed
the
bill
of
lading.
it
signed
the
bill
of
lading,
however,
not
in
its
capacity
as
stevedore
but
because
it
happened
also
that
the
local
agent
for
the
ship's
general
agents
who
did
business
in
new
york
and
had
employed
this
robert
c.
herd
&
company
back
in
baltimore.
actually,
there
was
no
bill
of
lading
in
existence
so
far
as
this
crate
was
concerned.
it
had
been
listed
on
a
bill
of
lading
prepared
by
the
freight
forwarders.
but
the
crate
had
been
deleted
from
the
bill
of
lading
after
it
fell
into
the
harbor
and
before
the
bill
of
lading
was
delivered
to
the
shipper
or
its
agents.
so,
there
was
never
any
bill
of
lading
in
existence
with
respect
to
this
crate
which
has
some
bearing
on
the
question
which
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked.
and
there
may
be
a
question
there,
as
to
whether
there
was
cogsa
coverage
because
there
was
no
bill
of
lading.
the
district
court
took
a
--
a
view
opposed
to
ours
on
that.
we
argued
that
point
but
it
did
not
agree
with
us
but
we
went
on
the
principal
grounds
and
that
they
were
quite
sufficient
for
our
purposes.
now,
on
threshold
of
this
case,
we
have
a
question
of
whether
there
was
any
coverage
under
the
carriage
goods
by
sea
act.
judge
thompson
held
that
the
loss
occurred
prior
to
the
time
when
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
became
effective
by
its
own
terms,
that
is,
prior
to
the
loading
on
to
the
vessel.
and
as
mr.
whip
has
said
the
american
cases
adopt
the
tackle
to
tackle
point
of
view.
now,
what
happened
here
is
the
ship's
tackle
had
never
been
made
fast
to
this
crate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
tackle
had
been
made
fast
to
it.
it
was
a
great
big
crate
and
it
was
sitting
flat
on
a
railroad
car
and
the
stevedores
in
order
to
get
the
usual
heavy
lifts
swing
under,
had
to
run
a
thin
wire
rope
to
try
to
raise
it
with
one
end
to
get
a
chuck
under
it
so
that
they
could
put
the
swing
under.
and
while
they
were
doing
it,
they
just
tipped
it
too
far
and
it
fell
over
against
the
vessel,
wrested
the
vessel
out
of
the
way
from
the
pier
and
the
crate
went
down
between
the
pier
and
the
--
and
the
vessel
went
on
the
bottom
of
the
patapsco
river
where
it
suffered
substantial
damage
because
it
was
precision
machinery
and
the
saltwater
just
ruined
it.
now,
judge
thompson
held
and
it's
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
consider
the
point
that
that
loss
occurring
before
the
period
when
cogsa
attached
of
its
own
force.
cogsa
was
of
no
application
here.
he
went
on
to
say,
however,
that
even
if
it
had
been,
he
was
convinced
that
the
stevedore
was
not
entitled
for
the
benefit
of
the
limitation
provisions
of
that
act.
and
i
have
--
well
i
have
mentioned
the
cogsa
coverage
point
preliminarily
in
the
case
because
it
was
one
which
was
raised
below
and
decided
by
the
district
court.
we
have
addressed
ourselves
throughout,
primarily
to
the
question
of
whether
a
negligent
stevedore
is
entitled
either
by
virtue
of
the
statutory
provisions
contained
in
cogsa
or
by
reason
of
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
lading
to
the
carrier's
limitation
of
liability.
we
say
that
he
is
not.
that
those
provisions
are
intended
for
the
benefit
of
the
carrier
and
the
carrier
alone,
that
they
do
not
provide
that
they
shall
benefit
the
carrier's
agents
whether
they
be
ones
in
the
carrier's
own
employ
or
whether
they'd
be
independent
contractors
as
was
in
the
case
here
but
certainly
clearly
not
in
the
latter
case.
now,
the
divergent
views
in
this
case
are,
on
the
one
hand,
the
collins
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
on
the
other,
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit.
and
i
think
i
can
persuade
your
honors
that
the
collins
case
was
wrongly
decided.
i
thought
so,
when
i
first
read
it
back
in
1952.
i
little
dreamt
that
i
will
have
the
opportunity
to
try
to
persuade
this
court
or
indeed
any
other
court
to
that
effect.
but
it
just
outraged
my
sense
of
propriety
when
i
first
read
it.
because
what
is
says
is,
that
a
stevedore
who
is
not
named
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
anywhere,
is
not
in
any
part
of
the
carriage
goods
by
sea
act,
not
only
not
in
the
limitation
section
but
not
anywhere
else
or
in
the
bill
of
lading
is,
nevertheless,
entitled
to
the
carrier's
limitation
rights
conferred
on
him
by
the
congress
in
consideration
of
certain
other
rights
which
the
carrier
gave
up
or
in
the
bill
of
lading
which
the
carriers
entered
into
with
the
shipper.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
no,
sir.
the
--
i
didn't
know
the
--
the
australian
case
at
that
time
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
in
the
elder-dempster
case,
you
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
oh,
the
mercy
case.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
it's
--
let's
say
it
shocked
my
sense
of
the
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
--
australian
results,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
wasn't
familiar
with
what
justice
franklin
decision
at
that
time.
i
became,
of
course,
well
aware
of
it
later
on.
now,
let's
see
what
the
reaction
has
been
to
the
collins
case.
in
the
first
place,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
it
was
a
two-to-one
decision.
and
i
think
if
you
read
judge
holmes'
dissenting
opinion
you
will
have
to
agree
that
he
has
all
the
better
of
the
argument.
the
next
view
attacking
majority
opinion
was
in
a
comment
in
the
harvard
law
review
in
66
harvard
law
review
and
it
criticized
the
decision
all
along
the
line.
then
we
came
to
the
decision
first
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
followed
by
the
district
court
in
michigan
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
finally
the
high
court
of
australia
where
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
holmes
was
referred
to
with
approval
and
the
majority
opinion
disapproved.
now,
one
of
the
chief
reliance
is,
if
your
honor
please,
by
the
court
in
the
collins
case
was
on
section
347
of
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency.
and
that
section
provides
and
apparently
if
you
just
read
it
without
moore,
apparently
would
be
applicable
to
the
situation.
it's
headed
applicable
immunities
of
principle
and
it
says
an
agent
who
is
acting
in
pursuant
of
his
authority
has
such
immunities
of
the
principle
as
are
not
personal
to
the
principle.
i
think
if
you
go
further
and
read
the
comments
in
connection
to
that
section,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
wasn't
intended
to
apply
to
this
situation
but
it
had
a
--
it
had
a
certain
appeal
on
its
face.
but,
unluckily
for
my
brothers
on
the
other
side
the
american
law
institute
pulled
the
rug
out
from
under
them
on
section
347
because
in
the
restatement
of
agency
second
which
has
just
recently
come
out,
section
347
has
been
revised
to
read,
“an
agent
does
not
have
the
immunities
of
this
principle,
although
acting
at
the
direction
of
the
principle.”
so,
it
recognizes
as
i
--
as
you've
seen
in
the
portion
of
the
summary
that
is
quoted
in
the
brief
that
the
choice
of
the
language
had
been
a
little
unhappy
and
it
perhaps
misled
the
court
to
--
in
thinking
that
what
it
said
there
was
of
--
over
that
type
of
situation.
now
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
immunity,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
not
in
the
--
not
in
the
restatement
second.
now,
they
gave
some
examples
in
the
other,
none
of
which
seems
to
me
to
be
applicable
to
the
case
presented
by
collins.
that's
why
i
said
if
--
if
you
read
the
examples
on
what
they
present
on
there,
it
was
pretty
clear
as
both
judge
thompson
and
judge
sobeloff
pointed
out
that
it
wasn't
applicable
to
the
--
this
type
of
case.
but
with
the
removal
of
the
particular
language
it
had
to
be
appealed,
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
clearly
wasn't
applicable.
now,
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
respective
equities
if
your
honors,
please
between
these
--
these
two
conflicting
views?
the
argument
of
my
brother
that
because
the
stevedore
was
doing
the
ship's
work
the
stevedore
should
be
entitled
to
the
same
limitation
of
liability
that
the
ship
is.
and
the
contrary
view
that
a
person
who
has
been
damaged
by
the
negligence
of
another
should
be
entitled
to
be
made
whole
by
that
other
person
in
the
absence
of
some
clear
and
compelling
legislative
or
contractual
provisions
to
the
contract.
the
mere
fact
that
the
stevedore
is
doing
the
work,
it
seems
to
me,
to
be
only
begging
the
question.
it
doesn't
follow
because
he's
doing
the
work,
that
that
necessarily
excuses
him
from
the
consequences
of
--
of
his
own
negligence.
every
agent
is
doing
his
principal's
work
but
that
doesn't
exonerate
him
for
an
improper
performance
of
it.
they
say
also
that
unless
we
give
the
stevedore
as
well
as
the
carrier
the
benefit
of
this
limitation
of
liability
provision,
we
will
in
some
way
impair
the
full
operation
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
but
that
is
clearly
not
so.
just
because
the
stevedore
may
be
held
individually
liable,
in
no
way,
affects
the
carrier's
right
to
get
the
limitation
which
the
act
first
pointed.
and
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
carrier
wasn't
even
sued.
mr.
whip
has
said
further
that
because
your
honors
have
held
in
the
sieracki
case
that
a
stevedore
is
entitled
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
which
the
vessel
owes
to
its
own
members
because
the
stevedore
is
doing
the
work
which
was
traditionally
the
work
of
the
crew,
that
it
follows
that
the
stevedore
here
should
have
the
same
benefits
as
the
--
as
the
carrier
would
have
had
had
the
suit
been
against
the
carrier.
well,
it
seems
to
me
quite
an
anomalous
thing
to
say
that
because
one
owes
a
duty
to
someone
else
as
a
stranger,
that
he
is
necessarily
entitled
to
the
same
privileges,
immunities,
limitations
of
liability
that
the
person
whose
work
he
is
performing
may
have
with
respect
to
a
shipper.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
that
is
a
related
question,
your
honor
and
it's
one
that
--
that
is
squarely
presented
by
that
michigan
case
that
mr.
whip
referred
to
the
--
the
international
milling
company
versus
nicholson
transit
company.
there
the
--
there
the
--
the
carrier
was
clearly
entitled
to
exoneration
from
liability
for
negligence
of
the
master
or
mariners
in
connection
with
the
management
or
navigation
of
the
vessel.
and
that
when
there
was
such
negligent
navigation
you
have
the
very
question
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked,
that
is,
whether
the
employee
should
be
exonerated.
the
nicholson
case
said
that
he
should
not.
now,
some
of
the
cases
referred
to
on
our
brief
go
that
far
although
they
--
they
are
mostly
ones
that
are
dealing
with
contractual
rather
than
statutory
matters.
if
i
understand,
as
a
matter
of
interest,
that
there
is
a
proposal
when
the
--
when
the
limitation
of
liability
statutes
are
amended,
if
they
eve
are,
pursuant
to
the
pending
discussions
in
--
in
brussels
that
the
limitation
be
made
available
to
the
masters
and
servants
of
the
carrier
as
well
as
to
the
carrier
himself.
but
that
it
has
not
yet
become
a
law.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
limitation
of
liability
statute
specifically
says
that
it
is
applicable
only
to
the
owner
or
the
owner
pro
hac
vice
and
not
to
the
--
not
to
the
masters
or
mariners.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
i
think
so,
your
honor.
there
is
--
there
is
one
sort
of
twilight
zone
in
there
where
the
answer
might
be
different.
let's
say
that
the
--
that
this
crate
had
been
lifted
by
the
ship's
tackle,
had
gotten
up
over
the
bulwarks
and
then
had
been
dropped
so
that
the
--
it
was
clearly
within
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
then
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
clearly
that
the
carrier
would
have
been
able
to
the
limit
and
--
and
on
our
contention
that
the
stevedore
would
not
have
been
able
to.
now
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
correct
to
say
eliminated.
they
just
found
it
unnecessary
to
pass
upon
it.
the
district
court
had
made
that
obvious.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
now,
if
your
honors
were
to
agree
with
the
district
court
on
that
point,
you
would
then
be
faced
with
this
question
so
far
as
the
carrier
is
concerned
although
of
course
the
carrier
hadn't
been
sued.
that
is,
whether
the
carrier's
provision
in
the
bill
of
lading
was
valid.
clearly,
the
bill
of
lading
did
entitle
the
carrier
to
limit
its
liability.
and
it's
mr.
whip's
contention
that
section
6
of
the
act
authorizes
such
a
limitation
in
the
bill
of
lading
and
i
can
understand
the
argument
because
it
does
say
that
the
--
nothing
in
the
act
shall
prevent
the
carrier
from
making
provisions
of
his
own,
covering
his
liability
before
loading
and
after
discharge.
however,
there's
another
provision
in
section
12
of
the
act
which
says
that
nothing
in
the
act
shall
be
construed
as
amending
or
appealing
the
harter
act
with
respect
to
the
duties,
responsibilities,
and
liabilities
of
the
ship
or
carrier
prior
to
the
time
when
the
goods
are
loaded
on
or
after
the
time
they
are
discharged
from
the
ship.
and
under
the
harter
act,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
clear
that
this
limitation
of
liability
clause
to
$500
would
be
invalid
because
that
is
a
limitation
clause
and
not
evaluation
clause.
evaluation
clause
has
been
sustained
by
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
back
in
294
united
states
i
think.
but
the
limitation
of
liability
clause
was
always
invalid
under
the
harter
act.
so,
that
while
we
don't
have
that
precise
situation
i
would
have
considerable
doubt
as
to
--
as
to
whether
in
that
twilight
zone
the
carrier
would
have
been
able
to
limit.
if
--
if
your
honors
decided
that
it
was
limited
in
the
cogsa
period,
i
think
the
carrier
clearly
would
have
been
entitled
to
but,
of
course,
we
contend
the
stevedore
is
not.
now,
my
brothers
have
also
said
as
an
argument
supporting
their
position
that
to
sustain
the
ruling
of
the
courts
in
this
case
would
result
in
a
windfall
to
the
cargo
owners.
i
just
find
it
almost
impossible
to
reconcile
a
statement
that
that
is
a
windfall.
i
think
it's
a
--
a
bad
term,
anyhow.
but
if
it's
a
windfall,
it
seems
to
me,
the
windfall
would
be
the
other
way
around
if
the
stevedore
were
granted
this
--
this
right
to
limit.
because
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
your
honor,
please.
suppose
--
suppose
this
cargo
had
been
valued
by
the
shippers
at
$50,000
and
then
have
been
damaged.
clearly,
the
carrier
would
have
been
liable
for
that
amount
had
it
been
negligent
and
i
think
my
opponents
can
see
the
stevedore
would
also
have
been
liable.
so,
that
they
would
have
paid
the
full
loss
because
there
was
no
such
declaration
of
value,
they'd
pay
only
$500.
it
was
on
their
argument.
but
the
compensation
the
stevedore
received
for
doing
this
work
was
precisely
the
same
in
both
situations.
the
carriers
wouldn't
have
been
the
carrier
got
an
increases
rate
with
increased
valuations.
but
the
stevedore,
according
to
the
stipulated
facts
in
this
case
in
the
findings
of
both
courts,
was
that
its
rates
were
not
dependent
on
value
whether
or
not
declared.
so,
there
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
that
is
customary
in
--
certainly
in
the
port
of
baltimore,
your
honor
and
i
think
on
the
east
coast
generally.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
the
--
the
rates
depend
on
weight,
density,
difficulty
of
handling,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
but
has
no
relation
to
value.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
i've
never
known
of
any,
your
honor.
i've
never
found
that.
and
i
think
the
--
the
usual
situation
is
just
what
prevailed
here
that
that
work
is
done
more
or
less
on
an
oral
basis
with
--
on
a
tariff
rate
which
is
based
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
douglas,
on
weight,
density
and
difficulty
of
handling
and
without
any
relation
to
value
whether
or
not
declared.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
--
well
it
seems
to
me
when
--
when
you
see
which
way
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well
i
--
of
course,
naturally
i
prefer
my
own
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
--
side
of
it.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
if
you
look
at
this
case
from
a
--
a
point
of
view,
a
technical
construction
about
the
statute
of
the
bill
of
lading,
there's
certainly
nothing
to
recommend
the
stevedore's
position.
the
stevedore
isn't
mentioned
in
either
of
the
act
or
the
bill
of
lading.
they
both
refer
to
the
ship
or
the
carrier
and
they
both
define
what
they
mean
by
ship
and
carrier,
in
slightly
different
language.
but
they
mean
in
--
basically
the
carrier
or
any
continuing
or
on
carrier
or
the
charterer
or
the
owner.
but
they
do
not
mention
stevedores
and
they
don't
mention
any
other
of
the
myriad
group
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
transportation
of
goods
in
commerce
for
both
land
and
waterborne.
so
that
you
can't
say
as
a
matter
of
technical
construction
and
use
of
the
words
that
they're
entitled
to
this
limitation
for
which
they
contend.
secondly
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
what's
that?
mr.
william
a.
grimes
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
crystal
clear,
i
think.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
and
there's
another
thing
that
is
crystal
clear
and
that
is
that
congress
didn't
say
a
word
about
this.
in
the
reports
considering
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
or
in
the
harter
act
which
came
before
and
pursuant
to
which
this
court
handed
down
the
decision
in
reid
versus
american
express
company.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
that
is
true,
sir,
but
that
--
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
that's
true.
but
there
--
there
you
didn't
--
that
was
dealing
with
non-statutory
law.
that
--
that
had
reference
to
the
--
to
the
judge
made
right
of
unseaworthiness,
not
to
a
statutory
right.
mr.
william
a.
grimes
well,
i
think
i
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
the
collins
case
wasn't
decided
until
1952.
that
was
16
years
after
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
and
many
more
years
and
not
after
the
harter
act
which
i
think
was
1893.
the
answer,
in
my
judgment,
is
that
until
somebody
dreamed
up
this
position
in
the
collins
case
everybody
had
assumed
the
other
on
the
principle
that
everyone
is
responsible
for
his
own
wrongs
and
fully
responsible
unless
a
valid
contract
or
a
valid
statute
said
something
to
the
contrary.
now,
collins
came
along
in
1952.
this
case
happened
in
1954
and
of
course
it
was
one
of
the
first
things
that
i
thought
of.
and
it
was
raised
right
then
and
there.
i
--
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
cases.
of
course,
this
has
to
be
said,
your
honor,
in
--
in
case
of
the
small
packages,
the
$500
limitation
will
cover
so
that
there
maybe
many
situations
where
it
isn't
presented.
now,
apart
from
the
statutory
construction
you
have
here
a
rule
urged
upon
my
brothers
which
is
in
derogation
to
common
law.
if
ever
there
was
one
that
should
be
strictly
construed,
that
is
it.
just
like
all
limitation
from
or
exemption
from
liability
statutes.
your
honors
have
said
that
over
and
over
again
both
with
respect
to
contracts,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
--
in
the
boston
metals
case,
and
mr.
justice
black
in
the
bisso
case.
to
construe
--
to
construe
the
--
the
provisions
otherwise
would
be
to
put
a
premium
on
negligence
and
make
it
possible
for
a
wrongdoer
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
his
act
and
also
impose
a
terrible
injustice
on
a
man
that's
been
damaged.
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
kitto
for
the
hight
court
of
australia
it
would
extend
the
class
of
persons
who
were
set
free
to
be
as
careless
as
they
want
at
the
expense
of
other
people.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
should
not
be
permitted.
thank
you
very
much.
