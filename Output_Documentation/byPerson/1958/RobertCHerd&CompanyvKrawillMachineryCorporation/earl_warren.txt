petitioner,

mr.

--
mr.
whip,
you
may
proceed.

mr.
grimes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
was
his
employee
who
was
sued
as
--
as
one
of
the
justices
asked
counsel,
would
he
be
entitled
to
the
limitation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
sue
both
--
both
the
--
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
and
they
have
both
been
found
negligent,
would
the
--
would
the
difference
in
liability
have
existed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
eliminated
that
issue
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grimes,
just
--
just
of
a
matter
of
curiosity.
i
don't
suppose
that
there's
on
this
case
much
but
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
there
wouldn't
be
more
precedence
than
there
are
in
this
field.
i
would
think
this
would
be
a
matter
of
almost
daily
occurrence
if
someone's
--
some
place
in
the
country
would
--
would
drop
a
package
in
--
in
loading
or
unloading
a
--
a
vessel
and
you
would
think
there
would
be
--
you
would
think
there
would
be
considerable
litigation
over
that.
