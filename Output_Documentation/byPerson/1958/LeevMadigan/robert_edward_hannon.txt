mr.
robert
edward
hannon
chief
justice
warren,
members
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
position
on
this
case
is
as
follows.
we
contend
that
since
john
lee
had
been
discharged
from
the
army,
he
cannot
be
court-martialed
by
the
army
that
the
then
existent
article
2
(e)
of
the
articles
of
war,
if
interpreted
to
confer
such
jurisdiction
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
before
i
start
the
presentations,
it's
important
to
keep
several
factors
in
mind.
primary
among
those
is
that
here
we
are
speaking
of
a
capital
offense.
we're
speaking
of
the
offense
of
murder.
second,
we're
speaking
of
an
offense
that
occurred
in
continental
united
states.
it
wasn't
overseas.
it
was
right
here
in
the
jurisdiction
of
our
local
district
courts.
it
was
an
offense
that
occurred
in
1949
and
under
the
world
conditions
and
the
local
conditions
that
existed
in
1949.
it
was
a
trial
by
--
of
a
person
who
had
received
and
executed
dishonorable
discharge.
it
was
a
discharge
that
had
been
handed
to
him,
differing
from
the
common
situation
now,
where
a
man
is
discharged,
been
given
a
dishonorable
discharge.
they
frequently
suspend
the
execution
of
that
discharge
until
completion
of
the
sentence.that
is
not
this
case.
this
could
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
it
would,
your
honor.
the
case
would
be
different
if
it
had
been
suspended
dishonorably
discharged,
because
then
he
would've
been
in
the
service.
here,
the
discharge
was
issued,
signed
and
in
hand,
delivered
to
the
accused,
to
mr.
lee.
lastly,
here,
we
don't
have
the
situation
which
occurred
in
the
toth
case
and
the
hirshberg
case
as
far
as
i
know
in
the
covert
and
reid
case.
this
case,
if
--
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
entirely
release
the
accused.
we're
asking
the
court
in
effect
to
turn
him
over
to
the
federal
district
court
for
trial.
it
is
not
a
case,
like
in
toth
or
hirshberg
where
that
he
will
escape
prosecution
if
he
was
released.
he
will
be
tried
by
the
federal
district
court
if
he's
released.
it's
an
offense
within
the
province
of
the
local
federal
district
court.
the
court
is
aware.
the
jurisdiction
of
court-martials
as
conferred
by
the
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14
and
that
is
the
only
place
that
the
congress
has
authority
to
court-martial
or
to
grant
court-martial
authority.
that
article,
of
course,
to
that
clause
says
that,
you
can
try
that
make
rules
for
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
then
in
the
toth
case,
you
stated
that
this
applied
to
persons
who
were,
“actually
members
of
the
armed
services.”
in
the
reid
case
you
said
“persons
who
are
serving
in
the
land
and
naval
forces.”
you,
in
a
footnote,
quoted
colonel
winthrop
who
is
highly
regarded
as
the
grand
father
of
the
blackstone
of
military
law,
who
said
that
the
law
or
the
fifth
amendment
clearly
distinguishes
the
civil
from
the
military
class.
they're
clearly
distinguishable
parties.
colonel
winthrop
also
said
that
the
law
and
you
quoted
in
the
footnote
in
the
covert
and
reid
cases.
you
say,
that
--
or
winthrop
says
“that
the
law
recognizes
no
third-class.
you're
either
in
the
service
or
you're
not
in
the
service.”
so
that
brings
us
down
to
which
class.
which
of
these
clearly
distinguishable
classes
does
a
dishonorably
discharged
prisoner
fall
into?
well,
we
can
look
at
him
and
look
at
his
status
and
being
in
the
service
is
a
status.
he
has
no
contract
with
the
military
because
the
military
has
expressly
repudiated
his
contract.
he
performs
no
duty.
he
renders
no
service.
he
receives
no
pay
like
mrs.
smith
and
mrs.
covert
he
is
housed
with
the
military
but
is
not
part
of
the
military.
i
think
insofar
as
covert
--
the
--
lee
is
in
the
same
situation
as
where
the
--
the
parties
in
the
covert
and
reid
cases.
however,
we
can
go
further.
the
army
itself
has
said
that
a
dishonorably
discharged
prisoner
is
not
a
soldier.
cited
in
the
brief
are
opinions
handed
down
by
the
judge
advocate
general.
he
stated
first,
a
dishonorable
--
dishonorably
discharged
soldier
cannot
be
tried
for
unauthorized
absence
because
unauthorized
absence
contemplates
a
duty
or
to
be
out
of
place
of
duty,
a
dishonorably
discharged
soldier
has
no
duty.
that's
from
the
judge
advocate
general
himself.
he
can't
be
tried
for
disobedience
of
orders.
the
judge
advocate
general
says,
“a
dishonorably
discharged
soldier
cannot
be
tried
for
disobedience
of
orders
because
he
is
not
a
soldier.”
he
is
not
entitled
--
a
dishonorably
discharged
soldier
is
not
entitled
to
special
services,
equipment
which
is
bought
out
of
appropriated
funds.
he's
not
entitled
to
that
because
according
to
the
judge
advocate
general
and
that
this
was
also
a
quote,
“he
is
not
a
member
of
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states.”
lastly,
the
attorney
general
or
the
judge
advocate
general
has
held
that
dishonorably
discharged
soldier
killed
by
the
enemy
is
not
in
the
status
of
“killed
in
action.”
the
reason
he
says
and
this
is
a
quote,
“a
dishonorably
discharged
soldier
becomes
a
civilian
even
though
retained
in
confinement
under
sentence
of
general
court-martial.”
so
clearly,
the
judge
advocate
general
has
held
a
dishonorably
discharged
prisoner
to
be
a
civilian.
we
can
go
to
colonel
winthrop
in
his
digest
to
the
--
digest
of
opinions
to
the
judge
advocate
general
in
1895.
in
that
digest,
the
colonel
in
1895
arrived
at
the
same
conclusions
or
substantially
the
same
conclusions
that
this
court
has
in
the
hirshberg
case
and
the
toth
case,
and
in
the
reid
case.
the
colonel
insofar
as
the
discharged
prisoner
is
concerned
says
unequivocally
that
they
are
civilians.
the
colonel
said
that
if
section
1361,
which
was
the
section
authorizing
trial
of
dishonorably
discharged
prisoners
at
that
time,
if
that
section
authorized
trial
of
dishonorably
discharged
prisoners,
it
was
unconstitutional.
the
colonel
in
his
military
law
and
precedents,
1920
held
the
same
thing.
he
said
that
a
dishonorably
discharged
soldier
is
a
civilian.
now,
the
government's
argument
is
this
insofar
as
the
necessity
if
the
case
is
concerned.
the
government
says,
so
we
have
a
man
here
in
a
military
prison,
it's
necessary
that
the
military
have
jurisdiction
to
court-martial
him
so
as
to
maintain
the
discipline
and
morale
of
their
prisoners.
i
submit
to
you
gentlemen
of
the
court
that
that
is
not
the
case.
the
head
of
a
military
prison
has
the
same
authority
as
a
warden
of
any
prison
has.
he
can
put
a
person
in
solitary
confinement.
he
can
do
this,
that
or
the
other
thing
to
maintain
his
discipline.
but
there
is
no
necessity
of
trying
a
man
for
a
capital
offense,
of
murder,
when
there's
a
local
district
court
which
could
also
try
him.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
the
constitutional
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
the
difference
is
this,
your
honor.
in
the
instance
where
the
discharged
--
the
dishonorable
discharge
is
suspended,
he
never
receives
a
discharge.
he
is
in
the
service.
he's
an
actual
member
of
the
service
having
--
not
having
been
discharged
until
after
the
completion
of
his
sentence.
in
this
case,
they
discharged
him
and
then
put
him
in
the
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
in
a
word
i
would
say
the
constitutional
or
legal
difference
being
in
the
one
case,
he's
a
member
of
the
service
and
under
the
--
the
article
1
can
be
tried.
in
the
second
instance,
he's
a
civilian,
and
because
he
has
actually
been
discharged.
the
second
instance
he's
never
been
actually
discharged.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
they
have
--
they
have
a
relation
to
him
in
the
sense
that
the
warden
of
any
prison
has
a
relation
to
a
prisoner
confined
there
at.
in
other
words,
the
normal
authority
that
a
prison
warden
has
over
prisoner,
but
they
don't
have
authority
to
--
to
try
him
for
murder
any
more
than
the
warden
of
a
normal
prison
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
i
don't
think
he's
a
member
of
the
military
establishment.
he
received
no
pay.
he
has
no
contract,
performs
no
duties,
not
entitled
to
any
of
the
benefits
of
the
military.
he's
killed,
he's
not
killed
in
action.
he
receives
none
of
the
benefits
of
a
member
of
the
military.
whereas
if
--
but
there
are
a
lot
of
different
results
that
evolved
to
a
prisoner
who
has
a
suspended
discharge
while
he's
serving
his
sentence.
in
the
first
place,
he
can
go
back
to
active
duty
when
he's
--
at
the
termination
of
the
sentence
without
being
re-enlisted,
whereas
if
a
person
has
an
executed
dishonorably
--
dishonorable
discharge,
he
would
have
to
re-enlist
to
get
back
into
the
service.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
status
of
whether
or
not
he
maintains
the
status
of
a
member
of
the
military.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
yes,
your
honor.
if
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
yes.
but
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
that's
correct.
he
--
he
has
--
the
congress
can't
class
the
--
he
isn't
classified
in
the
status
of
military
person
or
within
the
land
and
naval
forces.
returning
to
the
point
of
the
necessity
or
the
possible
adverse
effect
from
holding
that
this
man
is
not
amenable
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
and
that
congress
cannot
make
laws
subjecting
him
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
both
the
toth
and
the
reid
case
held
that
mere
convenience
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
deprive
a
person
of
his
constitutional
guarantees,
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
to
present
an
indictment.
the
mere
convenience
is
not
sufficient
to
subject
him
or
to
deprive
him
of
these
rights.
in
reid
it
was
held
all
persons
who
are
members
of
the
land
--
that
the
constitution
--
the
constitution
does
not
say
that
all
persons
who
are
members
of
the
land
and
naval
services
and
all
other
persons
whose
regulations
might
have
some
relation
to
the
maintenance
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
the
reid
case,
you
said,
it
must
be
a
member
of
the
land
and
the
naval
forces.
you
further
stated
in
the
reid
case
that
they
cannot
use
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
of
the
constitution
to
expand
this
jurisdiction
of
article
1.
the
toth
case,
i
think
it's
very
significant
and
quoting
the
language
of
the
toth
case,
the
court
held
that
the
military
jurisdiction
or
court-martial
jurisdiction
should
be
restricted
to
the
narrowest
jurisdiction
deemed
absolutely
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
discipline
in
the
army.
now,
that
raises
the
question
in
this
case,
was
the
court-martial
of
john
lee
at
camp
cooke
for
the
capital
offense
of
murder,
in
1949,
in
continental
united
states,
absolutely
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
discipline
at
camp
cooke?
or
wording
it
conversely,
would
there
have
been
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
discipline
of
camp
cooke,
to
take
john
lee,
150
miles
to
los
angeles
and
have
him
tried
by
a
civilian
court
there?
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
if
there
is
reasoning
from
the
toth
case,
i
would
assume
that
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
if
there's
--
if
there's
an
adverse
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
he's
one
or
the
other.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
he's
either
in
or
he's
not
in
the
service.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
if
i
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
now,
this
is
perhaps
falling
back
or
equivocating
on
that
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
here
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
no.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
--
this
is
more
in
the
line
of
reasoning
for
that
particular
rule.
you
weren't
in
--
in
the
toth
case
it
wasn't
explicitly
answered
as
to
whether
it
was
in
or
out
of
the
service.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
you
implied
that
there
might
be
something
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way,
your
honor.
i'll
say
that
if
the
court
finds
that
there
can
possibly
be
a
third-class,
which
is
not
military
and
not
civilian
but
is
subject
to
military
law,
if
there
is
a
class,
if
it's
not
--
if
what
colonel
winthrop
said
is
not
followed
by
the
court,
colonel
winthrop
said
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other.
the
court
in
the
toth
and
in
this
case
has
--
has
put
colonel
winthrop
to
that
effect
in
a
footnote,
but
it
does
not
expressly
held
that
you
have
to
be
one
or
the
other.
now,
i'm
saying
that
if
the
court
finds
that
--
that
you
might
not
have
to
be
in
the
service
to
be
tried
by
court-martial,
in
other
words,
if
there's
a
class
of
person
who
was
not
actually
in
the
service
but
can
still
be
tried
by
court-martial.
i'm
saying
that
if
that
is
the
case,
then
the
guiding
factors
there
is
to
whether
a
person
is
to
rely
on
the
service
the,
the
guiding
factor
is
to
whether
the
--
a
person
is
in
that
category,
if
a
person
not
in
the
service
but
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction,
then
i
think
the
rule
is
that
that
group
of
persons
should
be
limited
to
those
persons
who
the
court
deems
absolutely
essential
to
maintain
military
discipline,
and
falling
back
a
step,
in
other
words.
so,
that
here
i
don't
think
that
lee
would
fall
in
that
category.
i
don't
think
the
court-martial
of
lee
is
absolutely
essential
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
--
to
make
this
military
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
i
think
you
might
as
well
reach
that
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
yes.
our
prime
argument
goes
back
to
this
--
i
think,
that
it's
either
in
the
service
or
not
in
the
service.
if
that
doesn't
work
then
i
think
this
other
thing
of
--
of
whether
or
not
it
is
essential
to
military
discipline
which
might
be
different
overseas.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
it's
probably
is
different
overseas.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
that
--
that
your
honor
is
our
second
argument.
our
first
argument
is
he
has
to
be
one
or
the
other,
he's
either
in
or
he's
not
in.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
if
he's
not
in
regardless
of
the
situation
he
shouldn't
be
tried
by
court-martial.
our
second
argument
is
if
the
court
doesn't
buy
that
argument
then
going
back
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
--
one
step
further.
then
if
there
is
a
third-class,
part
military
and
part
civil,
then
the
test
should
be
absolutely
essential
for
military
discipline
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
that's
the
word
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
wording
from
the
toth
case.
we
don't
feel
that
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
--
it
was
absolutely
essential
for
military
discipline
to
try
a
man
for
murder
at
camp
cooke,
california
rather
than
taking
it
to
the
federal
district
court.
very
last
--
quickly,
i'd
like
to
touch
on
the
question,
which
is
going
to
be
presented
to
you
by
the
government
i'm
sure,
and
that
is
the
case
of
kahn
versus
anderson.
admittedly
kahn
versus
anderson
is
the
thorn
in
our
side.
the
kahn
versus
anderson
decision
was
handed
down
in
1920
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
however,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
distinguish
kahn
versus
anderson
in
this
case.
first,
if
not
most
important,
i
think
there's
a
question
in
the
kahn
versus
anderson
case
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
an
executed
dishonorable
discharge.
the
court
said,
“whether
or
not
there
was
an
executed
dishonorable
discharge
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.”
the
most
important
factor
of
the
kahn
case
is
this.
the
kahn
case
was
based
on
prior
cases.
it
was
based
on
carter
versus
mcclaughry
ex
parte
wildman
and
--
and
the
craig
case.
it
was
based
on
those
three
prior
cases.
now,
first
of
all,
if
you
take
the
carter
decision,
the
carter
decision
does
not
hold
that
the
military
does
not
have
jurisdiction
of
--
the
military
has
jurisdictions
to
try
and
discharge
prisoners.
so
far
as
the
carter
case
is
concerned,
that
is
strictly
dicta.
the
carter
case
holds
nothing
more
than
coleman
versus
tennessee,
that
is,
that
once
a
court-martial
has
started,
once
the
man
has
been
arrested
with
a
view
to
court-martial,
the
military
maintains
jurisdiction
over
him
up
until
a
completion
of
his
sentence.
captain
carter
in
the
carter
case
said
that
he
was
tried,
convicted,
given
a
dismissal,
and
five
years
confinement.
he
said
after
the
court
gave
him
the
dismissal,
they
lost
their
jurisdiction
to
carry
out
the
confinement
part
of
the
sentence.
the
carter
case
stands
for
nothing
more
than
a
continuing
jurisdiction.
once
jurisdiction
attaches,
it
continues
to
the
completion
of
the
sentence,
confinement
or
otherwise.
in
the
--
in
a
statement
in
the
carter
case
to
the
effect
that
--
the
military
has
jurisdiction
to
try
to
discharge
prisoners
is
purely
dicta.
there's
another
argument,
this
wildman
case
and
the
other
case,
were
based
i
think
to
a
degree
and
so
as
the
--
the
khan
versus
anderson
was
based
to
a
degree
on
the
fifth
amendment
argument
that
the
congress
derives
authority
from
the
fifth
amendment
to
try
or
to
give
to
the
military
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
offenses
which
arise
in
the
service.
this
court
in
both
the
toth
and
in
the
reid
case
has
expressly
stated
that
the
fifth
amendment
confers
no
--
no
authority
to
congress
to
confer
military
jurisdiction.
one
other
point,
the
counsel
in
the
kahn
case
failed
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
that
case
that
the
judge
advocate
general
himself
felt
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
or
that
the
article
1361
of
the
revised
statutes
was
unconstitutional.
counsel
failed
to
point
that
out
to
the
court.
another
point
in
the
kahn
case
is
that
the
offense
in
the
kahn
case
occurred
in
time
of
actual
war.
it
occurred
during
the
actual
shooting
war
of
world
war
i.
here,
the
offense
occurred
in
1949,
which
we
contend
was
a
time
of
peace
in
the
actual
sense,
if
not
in
the
technical
offense.
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i'll
deal
with
the
question
of
time
of
peace
and
time
of
war.i
think
in
this
regard,
we're
based,
of
course,
with
the
kahn
decision.
however,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
justice
black's
dissent
in
the
ludecke
case.
that
is
found
in
our
brief
on
page
30.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
idea
expressed
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
[laughs]
well,
i
think,
justice
black,
in
--
in
regards
to
this
particular
issue,
that
is
the
crux
of
it,
and
i
think
that
is
the
law
that
has
been
since
that
time
adopted.
it
says
that
in
interpreting
any
statue
as
to
when
we
have
time
of
peace
and
when
we
have
time
of
war,
you
can't
just
blandly
say
that
such
and
such
a
date
will
always
terminate
a
war.
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
--
the
intent
behind
the
statute.
the
reason
for
the
statute
that
congress
had
in
mind
as
it
just
is
said
in
such
cases
we
are
called
upon
--
in
such
cases,
we
are
called
on
to
interpret
the
statute
as
best
as
we
can
so
as
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
congress
in
connection
with
particular
right
the
statute
was
intended
to
protect.
i
think
that
decision
--
that
idea
has
also
been
followed
by
the
--
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
the
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
i
think
the
kahn
case
disagrees
with
that.
the
kahn
case
says
that
it
means
peace
in
the
complete
sense
officially
declared
and
then
the
kahn
case
goes
on
to
say
or
imply
that
nothing
but
a
peace
treaty
can
terminate
war.
and
i
think
that
various
things
can
terminate
local
war
for
various
statutes.
i
don't
think
you
can't
point
in
advance
that
anyone
thing
and
say,
“well,
in
all
cases,
a
peace
treaty
must
necessarily
terminates
the
war.”
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
my
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
i
think
that
if
we
can
assume
that
well,
i
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
[laughs]
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
in
this
--
i
think
in
any
event,
that
that
is
now
the
law
or
appears
to
be
the
law
that
you
must
look
at
the
particular
purpose
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
statute
or
the
right
that
they
sought
to
protect.
well,
under
this
92nd
article
of
war,
we
can
look
at
it
and
has
--
well,
what
did
--
what
right
was
congress
trying
to
protect
by
saying
that
the
military
could
not
try
a
person
for
murder
in
time
of
peace
but
right
where
they're
trying
to
protect.
well,
they
were
obviously
saying
if
it's
a
murder
case,
a
very
important
capital
offense
turn
him
over
to
the
civilians
to
try
where
he'll
have
his
constitutional
rights.
i
think
that's
the
obvious
purpose
that
congress
had
in
this
statute.
so
that
boils
down
to
the
question
--
well,
of
course,
conversely,
by
stating
that,
the
congress
had
in
mind
that
there
would
be
certain
times
when
it
wouldn't
be
expedient
to
turn
murder
cases
over
to
the
civilian
courts
where
the
constitutional
guarantees
prevail.
certain
times,
when
it
wouldn't
work,
those
certain
times
are
mentioned
in
the
article,
number
one,
if
it's
outside
the
continental
united
states.
well,
if
it's
outside
the
continental
united
states,
your
alternatives
there
are
either
try
him
by
court-martial
or
turn
him
over
to
the
foreign
jurisdiction.
now,
the
other
occasion
is
in
time
of
war.
we
won't
turn
a
murder
case
over
to
civilians.
well,
obviously
in
time
of
war,
they
mean,
i
think,
like
this
court
is
held,
when
the
courts
are
closed,
the
idea
of
the
milligan
case
and
the
hawaiian
cases,
it's
--
when
the
courts
are
closed,
there
is
no
civilian
court
where
the
man
could
be
tried
for
murder
so
therefore,
try
him
by
court-martial.
now,
taking
one
step
further
from
that,
what
was
the
condition
in
california
in
1949
that
precluded
him
from
having
his
constitutional
guarantees
by
a
trial
in
civilian
court?
it
would
--
could
it
be
said
that
congress,
in
setting
up
this
statute,
contemplated
that
a
situation
like
1949
would
be
time
of
war
or
would
you
say
that
congress
in
enacting
article
of
war
92
thought
that
it
was
a
technical
state
of
war
that
would
control?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
congress
was
dealing
with
actualities
when
they
talked
the
time
of
peace
and
time
of
war.
and
the
actualities
in
california
in
1949
certainly
were
a
time
of
peace.
that
has
been
the
decision
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
the
shell
and
bussmann
cases.
the
lower
court
--
the
bussmann
case
which
is
a
recent
court
of
military
appeals'
decision
says
that
in
korea,
we
arrived
at
a
time
of
war
in
purposes
of
the
articles
of
the
code
when
they
stop
shooting,
when
the
armies
--
this
was
signed.
the
lower
court
attempts
to
distinguish
this
by
saying,
“well,
in
korea,
there
was
no
declaration
of
war.
therefore,
there
does
not
have
to
be
a
treaty
to
terminate
this
war.”
but
--
and
the
answer
for
that,
“for
one
thing,
you
could
say
there
was
no
treaty
after
world
war
ii
for
six
years.
what's
to
say,
there
won't
be
a
treaty
after
korea
within
six
years.”
and
secondarily,
i
don't
think
from
reading
the
bussmann
case,
you
can
get
such
a
narrow
meaning
from
it.
i'm
quoting
from
page
37
of
the
brief
where
the
court
of
military
appeals
says,
“and
that
congress,
when
it
used
the
phrase
‘in
time
of
war'
in
the
military
code
intended
that
phrase
to
apply
to
that
state
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
was
initiated
or
continued
or
--
with
or
without
formal
declaration.”
i
think
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
squarely
held
that
incidentally,
there
is
a
further
case
from
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
just
came
down
and
it's
not
cited
in
our
brief,
it's
united
states
versus
carr,
and
it's
23
cmr
273.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
military
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
yes,
your
honor.
it's
23
cmr
273.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
that
case,
the
court
of
military
appeals
says,
“in
those
cases,
this
court
concluded
that
upon
the
cessation
of
hostilities
in
korea
on
july
27,
1953,
pursuant
to
the
armistice
a
state
of
war
no
longer
exists
for
purposes
of
military
law.
thus,
it
is
crystal
clear
that
the
inception
of
the
accused
absence
occurred
in
time
of
peace.”
the
accused
went
on
unauthorized
absence
on
august
3rd,
1953
less
than
a
month
after
the
armistice.
they
said
that
he
went
on
unauthorized
absence
in
time
of
peace.
quickly
carrying
over
to
the
second
portion
of
the
argument,
that
is
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
article
2
(e).
here,
we
are
speaking
of
2
(e)
under
the
1920
code.we
are
not
speaking
under
the
present
uniform
code
of
military
justice
but
the
2
(e)
under
the
existing
code.
number
one,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
first
enactment
of
that
2
(e)
in
1898,
the
bill
was
entitled
an
amendment
to
the
summary
court
act.
a
summary
court
is
a
court
that
can
give
up
to
three
months
jurisdiction.
obviously,
what
they
intended
was
to
give
to
the
military
prison
warden
jurisdiction
similar
to
what
a
--
any
prison
warden
has.
now,
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
was
subsequently
went
into
the
code.
and
in
the
code,
it's
just
another
article
under
the
jurisdictional
aspects
of
it.
but
initially,
it
was
and
these
letters
back
and
forth
that
counsel
quoted
were
under
that
heading,
amendment
to
the
summary
court
act.
i
think
that
the
argument
boils
at
to
two
parts.number
one,
and
this
was
the
same
problem
i
had
problems
with
yesterday,
on
reflection,
i
think
it
because
to
the
constitutionality,
it
boils
it
to
two
parts.
i'm
running
over,
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
right.
i
think
first
of
all,
we
can
determine
was
he
in
the
armed
forces
or
was
he
a
member
of
the
armed
forces?
now,
if
--
on
that
particular
argument,
if
he
--
the
--
he
has
no
contract,
he
wears
no
uniform,
he
receives
no
pay,
he
performs
no
services,
he
can't
be
sent
to
war,
he
has
none
of
the
incidence
of
a
member
in
the
status
or
a
person
of
the
status
of
a
member
of
the
military.
the
army
itself,
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
has
said
he
is
not
a
soldier,
and
winthrop
said
he
is
not
a
soldier.
but
there
is
some
indication
or
perhaps
there
is
a
third
class,
a
class
that
is
not
entirely
in
the
service
yet.
he
is
subject
to
jurisdiction.
i
think
then
that
even
if
there
is
such
a
class,
if
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
say
that
you're
either
in
or
out,
if
there
is
a
third
class,
this
man
wouldn't
fall
on
that
third
class
because
that
third
class
apparently
is
predicated
on
the
idea
that
his
control
over
him
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
military
discipline.
now,
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
absolute
necessity
for
having
court-martial
jurisdiction
for
a
capital
offense
over
a
man
confined
in
california
in
1949?
the
need
isn't
there.
this
third
class,
if
it
exists,
is
a
class
that
is
based
on
need
apparently.
that's
the
only
reason
for
it
in
any
event.
and
if
there
is
no
--
in
this
case,
there
is
no
need
nor
in
the
case
of
a
dishonorably
discharged
prisoner
confined
in
the
united
states.
there
is
no
need
to
set
up
a
third
class
which
is
part
military
and
part
civil.
but
i
think,
in
my
opinion,
there
is
no
such
third
class
that
the
person
is
either
in
the
status
of
a
member
of
the
armed
services
or
he
is
in
the
status
of
a
civilian.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
he
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
well,
i
think
a
cb
would
be
--
he
is
enlisted.
he
has
a
contract
with
the
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
he
is
a
civilian.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
however,
it
isn't
essential
--
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
--
for
our
case
to
go
that
far.
mr.
robert
edward
hannon
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
we
could
say
that
there
is
a
third
class
that
is
--
that
is
not
in
that
--
this
man
is
not
in
that
third
class.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
