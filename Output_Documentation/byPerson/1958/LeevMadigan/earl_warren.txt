when
you
say
the
war
ended,
you
mean
the
cessation
of
hostility?
chief
justice
earl

the

stopped.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rhoads,
is
there
any
case
in
the
military
court
of
appeals
where
it
is
held
that
between
july
1947,
the
date
of
the
congressional
resolution,
and
june
24th,
1950,
the
beginning
of
the
korean
affair,
that
the
military
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
--
over
these
people
in
situations
this
man
has
had?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
found
any
case
where
he
was
tried
in
the
civil
courts
in
those
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
during
that
period?
chief

chief

number

john
lee,
petitioner,
versus
paul
j.
madigan.
mr.
davis,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
he
committed
the
same
crime
now,
he
would
be
tried
in
a
district
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
may
i
pursue
that
just
one
step
farther.
now,
let's
say
in
1949
at
the
time
the
second
offense
happened,
the
one
for
which
he
is
prosecuted
here,
he
had
been
confined
in
the
--
in
alcatraz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
had
been
confined
in
alcatraz
and
had
committed
the
same
crime
at
the
same
time,
would
--
would
the
army
have
had
jurisdiction
over
him
to
try
him
or
would
have
been
essential
for
him
to
be
tried
in
the
district
court
in
san
francisco?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
statute
any
different
now
or
--
or
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
--
mr.
davis,
do
you
think
that
the
law
could
be
--
respecting
an
individual,
could
be
changed
by
the
policy
of
the
department
as
to
whether
he
should
be
retained
in
a
--
in
a
military
prison
for
35
years
in
a
case
like
this
or
whether
he
--
he
should
be
sent
to
alcatraz
or
--
or
san
quentin
prison,
the
state
prison
in
california.
do
you
believe
that
it
should
be
left
to
--
to
the
army
to
decide
whether
it
should
retain
jurisdiction
over
a
man
all
his
life
depending
on
whether
they
kept
him
in
a
military
establishment
or
whether
they
send
him
to
--
to
prison
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
what
the
policy
was
so
far
as
sending
him
to
civilian
prisons?was
it
to
--
to
send
those
who
were
less
dangerous
or
those
who
were
more
dangerous
to
state
penitentiary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
asked
the
question,
this
man
got
a
pretty
severe
sentence
for
--
for
his
crime.
the
first
time
was
35
years.
pretty
bad
crime
that
he
committed,
wasn't
it
or
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
i'm
wondering
on
--
on
what
basis
they
would
--
they
would
keep
him
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
military
prison
or
send
him
--
send
him
to
a
state
prison?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
can't
transfer
him
back
to
a
--
to
a
military
prison?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
this
man
was
sentenced
done
on
this
second
charge
then
he
was
sentenced
to
alcatraz,
was
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
--
by
the
order
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
was
there
a
uniform
policy
at
the
time
this
man
was
--
was
sentenced
concerning
the
issuance
of
dishonorable
discharge?
and
if
so,
was
that
policy
consistent
with
what
they
did
here?
did
they
--
did
they
always
issue
the
--
the
dishonorable
discharge
transmitted
to
the
--
to
the
defendant
and
then
put
it
in
his
files?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
in
the
judgment
against
him
or
was
that
in
the
--
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
--
and
were
not
stated
in
the
--
is
that
stated
in
the
execution
or
--
or
was
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
discretion
within?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
we
take
this
particular
case
if
the
officer
who
executed
this
judgment
against
this
defendant
was
to
hold
this
thing
in
his
hands
throughout
the
35
years
if
the
man
was
serving
his
percent
that
he
could
determine.
he
could
determine
if
and
when
or
at
all
this
man
was
to
--
to
get
his
--
his
dishonorable
discharge
and
--
and
be
detached
from
the
service
or
whether
he
should
have
remained
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
the
withholding
or
the
immediate
issuance
of
his
discharge
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
is
anything
said
in
that
statute
or
in
any
of
the
regulations
concerning
the
time
that
his
dishonorable
discharge
shall
be
issued
and
served
upon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
becomes
a
matter
of
policy
with
the
executing
officers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
directions
coming
from
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hannon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
article
remain
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
you
have
three
to
four
minutes
more
until
the
red
light
comes
in.
