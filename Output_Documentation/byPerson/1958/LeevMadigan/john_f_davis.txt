mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
because
of
the
limited
time
which
is
left
before
the
court
rises
for
the
day,
i
would
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
construction
problem
of
article
92,
the
time
of
peace
matter
rather
than
dealing
with
the
constitutional
issue
which
has
just
been
discussed.
i
think
that
in
the
limited
time
we
may
be
able
to
deal
with
the
question
of
construction.
now,
the
timetable
which
we
have
to
have
in
mind
in
connection
with
whether
or
not
this
homicide
took
place
in
time
of
peace
is
as
follows.
the
incident
occurred
on
june
10,
1949.
armistices
had
been
signed
in
both
europe
and
in
japan
in
1945,
and
the
president
had
proclaimed
the
end
of
hostilities
as
of
the
close
of
1946.
however,
the
final
peace
previews
and
the
proclamations
of
peace
were
not
--
were
not
issued
until
--
for
europe
1951,
and
for
japan
1952.
so
that
our
question
here
is,
in
the
light
of
this
timetable
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
wrote
“time
of
peace”
into
article
92?
now,
this
is
purely
a
question
of
construction,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this
because
i
think
it
draws
a
distinction
between
this
type
of
case
and
the
type
of
case
which
deals
with
war
powers.
there
are
a
group
of
cases
in
which
the
court
has
had
to
consider
whether
or
not
congress
had
power
to
take
certain
action.
and
it
has
power,
the
court
says,
in
time
of
--
in
time
of
war
which
it
does
not
have
in
time
of
peace
because
of
the
war
powers
specifically
granted
by
the
constitution.
but
this
does
not
mean
that
congress
by
making
its
own
definition
of
war
or
peace
can
extend
its
powers
indefinitely.
the
court
must
look
at
the
definitions
it
uses,
the
declarations
it
makes,
and
determine
whether
there
--
whether
they
fall
within
the
realm
of
reason
because
otherwise
congress
could
by
its
own
act
extend
its
own
war
powers
which
it
cannot
do.
but
here,
the
power
of
--
or
the
power
of
the
army
to
court-martial
does
not
depend
upon
whether
or
not
there's
war
or
peace.
congress
could
have
said
that
they
--
and
in
fact,
does
say
in
the
present
articles
of
war,
that
murder
may
be
court-martialed
in
time
of
peace
as
well
as
in
time
of
war.
so
our
sole
question
is,
what
does
congress
mean
not
what
was
--
what
were
its
powers?
now,
i
suggest
it
is
abundantly
clear
with
respect
to
article
92
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
terminate
court-martial
jurisdiction
prior
to
the
final
promulgation
of
peace,
neither
the
congress
nor
the
president.
when
the
president
made
his
proclamation
of
the
end
of
hostilities,
he
was
keenly
aware
of
the
problems
of
wartime
legislation.
and
in
the
proclamation,
he
specifically
stated
that
the
state
of
war
was
to
be
continued,
which
was
done
with
the
idea
that
there
were
statutes
dealing
with
war
power
and
that
he
did
not
intend
his
proclamation
to
affect
them.
then
in
1947,
congress
deliberately
terminated
the
effectiveness
of
certain
provisions
of
its
statutes
which
would
be
effective
during
time
of
war.
and
in
doing
this
it
went
through
an
incredibly
long
list
of
statutes
dealing
with
war
powers,
and
it
selected
from
them,
individual
statutes
which
it
said
are
no
longer
necessary
to
be
--
to
be
continued
in
effect.
and
it's
interesting
in
this
respect
to
note
that
it
selected
certain
of
the
articles
of
war,
of
these
same
articles
of
war,
which
we
have
before
us.
and
considered
that,
as
to
them,
the
war
should
no
longer
be
continued
in
effect.
one
of
these
--
one
of
these
articles
was
the
article
dealing
with
desertion
which
carries
a
different
punishment
in
time
of
war
than
in
time
of
peace.
and
for
the
purposes
of
construction
of
that
article,
congress
specifically
stated
that
we
now
would
consider
it
is
no
longer
necessary
to
consider
it
a
time
of
war.
the
--
we
have
made
reference
to
the
articles
which
were
terminated
on
page
45
of
--
of
our
brief
and
we
have
listed
also
some
of
the
other
articles
from
the
footnote
which
are
dependent
upon
time
of
war
or
time
of
peace
and
which
congress
specifically
decided
to
--
not
to
affect
by
this
declaration.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
the
authority
of
congress
to
define
peace
and
war
for
the
purposes
of
the
articles
of
war
themselves.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
a
rather
old
case,
mcelrath
against
the
united
states
102
u.s.
426
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
by
the
power
of
the
president
which
was
limited
to
the
time
of
war
to
dismiss
officers
without
court-martial,
court
--
court-martial
was
upheld
in
a
period
between
the
end
of
open
hostilities
in
the
civil
war
and
before
the
proclamation
of
the
president
that
the
war
has
been
completed
which
came
out
in
august
of
1966.
the
specific
question
before
the
court
in
that
case
was,
was
it
proper
for
the
president
to
exert
these
powers
at
this
time?
and
there
they
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
statute
was
to
have
total
peace,
that's
what
congress
had
meant
and
there
was
not
total
peace
until
the
president
had
issued
the
actual
proclamation.
then
we
have
the
case
of
kahn
against
anderson.
and
in
kahn
against
anderson,
again,
the
question
came
up
whether
the
war
had
been
concluded.
there
are
difference
in
--
differences
in
the
facts
between
that
case
and
this
with
respect
to
the
termination
of
war.
in
fact,
the
--
the
petitioner
in
that
case
claimed
that
it
wasn't
a
question
of
when
the
homicide
took
place
but
it
was
a
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial
and
that
the
court-martial
terminated
with
--
with
the
time
of
peace.
this
appears
to
be
an
extraordinary
reading
of
the
--
of
the
language
of
the
statute
but
it's
the
way
he
read
it.
and
the
court
in
passing
upon
it,
said
that
they
must
consider
it
--
must
consider
that
the
time
of
peace
did
not
come
until
there
was
total
peace
and
that
the
armistice
in
1900
--
in
november
11,
1918
did
not
achieve
total
peace.
and
then
we
come
to
the
--
to
the
cases
which
were
cited
by
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
korean
conflict
and
with
respect
to
the
court
of
military
justice.
i
think
there's
nothing
inconsistent
in
those
cases
with
the
position
that
we
take
here.
the
--
the
reasoning
of
those
cases
is
precisely
the
kind
of
reasoning
that
we
have
in
this
case.
the
facts
of
--
are
very
different
because
you
didn't
have
a
declared
war,
you
had
a
--
had
a
war
which
resulted
as
--
as
from
international
action.
and
in
that
case
like
the
--
in
effect
hold,
that
the
war
was
terminated
not
when
they
stopped
fighting
and
the
court
will
remember
there
was
a
period
of
uneasy
truce
while
negotiations
were
going
on.
but
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
korean
conflict
it
--
it
ended
at
the
time
of
the
united
nations
agreement
which
terminated
those
hostilities
being
no
declaration
of
war
there
was
no
occasion
for
--
for
a
proclamation
of
peace.
and
i
do
not
find
in
--
in
those
cases
anything,
although
petitioner
finds
competent
and
i
find
nothing
in
those
cases
which
in
any
way
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
which
we
take
here.
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
there
were
decisions
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
supported
the
position
of
the
petitioner.
i
think
it's
unlikely
we
will
find
those
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
military
--
that
the
1950
uniform
code,
which
sets
up
the
court
of
military
appeals
became
effective
on
may
31,
1951,
and
the
period
when
one
could
appeal
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
30
days
from
the
final
judgment
and
it's
unlikely
that
it
might
come
up
collaterally.
and
i
can't
say
that
there
are
no
cases
which
deal
with
the
period
that
your
honor
suggested
but
it's
unlikely,
and
i
know
of
none
that
have
come
up
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
with
respect
to
that
issue.
mr.
john
f.
davis
during
that
period?
in
my
mind
i
tried
to
think
from
the
court
was
asking
i
don't
--
my
mind
doesn't
advert
to
any.
i
will
--
during
the
recess,
i'll
see
if
--
i'll
search
my
memory
and
see
if
there's
anything
more
than
i
could
find
on
that.
but
i
--
i
don't
think
of
any
at
the
moment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
shall
turn
my
attention
now
to
the
issue
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
of
courts-martial.
all
the
soldiers
who
have
been
adjudged
guilty
by
previous
court-martials
dishonorably
discharged
and
imprisoned
and
who
commit
offenses
while
they
are
in
the
custody
of
the
army
in
the
disciplinary
barracks.
now,
this
issue
is
purely
constitutional.
no
argument
has
been
advanced
that
the
article
of
war,
which
is
presently
involved,
number
--
article
2
(e)
of
the
1920
articles
does
not
specifically
and
intentionally
apply
to
this
petitioner.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
doubt
the
congress
intended
to
give
the
military
the
power
to
exercise
court-martial
jurisdiction
of
this
type
of
prisoner.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
it
constitutionally
could
give
the
army
this
power.
not
only
does
the
present
article
clearly
attempt
to
give
jurisdiction
to
the
court-martials
but
this
has
been
so
for
a
good
many
years.
the
first
provision
providing
for
this
type
of
jurisdiction
was
in
1863
when
the
first
military
prisons
were
established.
it's
present
in
the
uniform
code,
the
present
uniform
code
which
is
in
effect
today
with
respect
to
all
of
the
armed
forces.
the
same
type
of
jurisdiction
is
--
is
given
to
courts-martial
if
it
can
be
given.
when
the
--
when
the
army
discontinued,
and
i
don't
know
why,
but
when
they
discontinued
their
--
their
prisons
and
began
to
send
the
men
who
are
under
the
court-martials
sentence
back
to
the
guardhouses
back
in
1898,
the
secretary
of
war
wrote
a
letter
to
congress
saying
that
this
terminated
the
jurisdiction
which
the
army
had
previously
had
which
was
particularized
with
respect
to
army
prisons
and
that
he
felt
the
congress
should
enact
legislation
to
give
the
army
general
jurisdiction
of
discharged
soldiers
while
they
were
still
in
custody
whether
in
prisons
or
in
guardhouses
or
anywhere
else
within
the
army's
jurisdiction.
he
said
that
it
was
difficult
to
maintain
discipline
unless
the
army
had
authority
to
enlarge
the
sentences
through
court-martial
of
prisoners
who
were
subject
to
their
control,
and
it
was
then
that
the
congress
enacted
the
code
of
1898
which
provided
that,
and
i
quote,
it's
on
page
30
of
our
brief,
the
first
general
provision
in
the
court
--
in
the
articles
of
war
dealing
with
this
question
of
jurisdiction
and
it
said,
"soldiers
sentenced
by
court-martial
to
dishonorable
discharged
and
confinement
shall,
until
discharged
from
such
confinement,
remain
subject
to
the
articles
of
war
and
other
laws
relating
to
the
administration
of
military
justice."
and
this
law
remained
on
the
books
in
this
form
and
go,
i
think
it
was
1916
when
the
congress
enacted
the
same
provision
in
its
present
form
which
provide
simply
that
it
shall
extend
to
--
the
military
jurisdiction
shall
extend
to
"all
persons
under
sentence
adjudged
by
courts-martial".
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
not
the
case.
this
language
doesn't
--
i
--
it
would
be
a
different
case
and
this
language
would
seem
to
include
it
but
i'm
not
sure
about
what
the
legislative
history
behind
it
and
what's
happened
second.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
is
now
confined
in
--
in
alcatraz.
and
under
the
present
articles
of
war,
uniform
code,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
military
jurisdiction
because
the
present
article
say
under
--
under
--
and
i
don't
quote
exactly
but
they
feel
with
confinement
by
the
military
authorities
themselves.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
camp
cooke.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it
was
run
by
the
military.
it
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
army
only.
it
was
a
branch
--
branch
of
the
disciplinary
barracks
at
fort
lauderdale.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
he
would
not
be
subjected
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
to
military
discipline
at
that
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
not
fully
familiar
with
the
activities
at
that
place.
i
--
as
far
as
this
man
is
concern,
the
--
there
were
disciplinary
barracks
there
which
were
exclusively
disciplinary
barracks
and
whether
there
were
other
activities
in
the
camp,
i
--
i
don't
know.
but
as
far
as
this
man
was
concerned,
he
was
--
he
was
only
subject
to
disciplinary
barracks.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
are
all
military
personnel.
that
is
right.
by
law,
the
--
the
provisions
with
respect
to
the
disciplinary
barracks
is
set
up
in
article
10
of
the
--
of
the
code
in
--
in
chapter
10
of
the
code.
and
they
provide
that
it
shall
be
run
by
the
army.
and
the
--
although
it
is
a
--
is
a
detention
place,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
the
--
of
the
color
of
army
life
attached
to
it.
the
--
there
is
an
attempt
to
rehabilitate
prisoners
and
make
them
fit
for
the
army
again
with
some
military
training.
actually,
some
of
the
prisoners
are
organized
as
infantry
would
be
and
they
have
their
own
non-commission
officers
in
the
prison.
they
call
them
upside-down
and
upside-down
corporals
and
that
kind
of
thing.
i
don't
mean
that
they
are
non-commissioned
officers
but
their
--
their
operations
are
run
along
that
line.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
is
attached
--
there
is
a
part
of
the
record,
the
court-martial
record
of
the
thing,
and
it
shows
that
this
--
this
particular
petitioner
was
actually
locked
up
in
a
cell
because
it
would
be
difficult
--
he
was
a
danger,
he
was
dangerous
to
other
--
other
prisoners.
there
had
been
many
disciplinary
problems
with
respect
to
him,
and
he
was
actually
very
closely
confined.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
can't
say
that
it
--
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
at
least
that
he
was
locked
up
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
considerably.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
--
i
evaded
the
question
about
what
would
have
happened
if
the
statute
hadn't
been
changed.
this
--
the
--
the
statute
has
been
changed
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
then
he
is
in
alcatraz
so
there's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
no
question
at
the
present
time
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
a
civilian
court.
if
the
statute
had
not
been
changed,
the
language
of
the
statute
says
all
persons
under
sentence
are
judged
by
courts-martial
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
would
appear
to
be
broad
enough
perhaps
to
cover
a
civilian
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
absolutely.
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
also
provided
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
uniform
code.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
he
had
been
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
on
it.
the
law,
the
law
would
read
all
persons
under
sentence
adjudged
by
court-martial
would
be
subject
to
military
discipline,
would
be
separate
--
subject
to
court-martial.
and
it
would
seem
to
include
a
man
that
was
in
a
civilian
prison.
but
whether
it
would
receive
a
construction
because
of
the
law
that
went
before
that
said
clearly
dealt
with
situations
while
they
were
under
military
control
and
that
is
clearly
the
intent
of
the
statute
whether
there
will
be
a
limitation
that
into
it,
i
do
not
know.
there's
no
authority
on
it
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
there
were
specific
provisions
and
regulations
with
respect
to
permitting
them
to
be
confined
in
--
in
ordinary
prisons
when
they
were
the
type
--
at
that
time,
the
statute
provided
that
they
could
be
confined
in
prisons,
the
--
the
federal
prison
system
or
even
state
prison
systems
where
federal
prisoners
could
be
confined
there,
when
they
were
guilty
of
the
type
of
crime
and
for
a
period
of
years
which
made
it
appropriate
for
them
to
be
confined
in
--
in
an
ordinary
prison.
they
tried
to
distinguish
between
people
that
were
felons
with
criminals
in
the
ordinary
sense
and
people
that
they
would
--
could
rehabilitate
to
make
soldiers
out
of
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
the
practice
isn't
different,
the
statute
is
different.
now,
the
statute
gives
authority
without
direction
so
that
they
can
be
defined
either
in
military
disciplinary
barracks,
all
federal
prisons
depending
upon
regulations
by
the
--
by
the
armed
forces.
and
i
think
the
policy
is
the
same
but
the
statute
isn't
as
explicit
as
it
used
to
be.
mr.
john
f.
davis
on
where
they
should
be
--
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
confined?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
have
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
when
they
can
be
--
yes,
that
appears,
i
think,
at
page
1
of
our
arguments.
it's
not
page
1
of
the
brief,
but
page
1
of
the
argument.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
but
--
but
it's
very
easy.
the
--
the
way
it
is
--
the
way
it
was,
the
way
it's
before
this
court,
it
appears
in
page
2
of
the
brief
which
says
“all
persons
under
sentence
adjudged
by
courts-martial”.
that
appears
at
page
2
down
at
the
bottom.
the
way
it
is
now
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
appears
at
page
8
of
our
brief
and
it's
now
section
2
(7)
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
it
provides
for
jurisdiction
of
persons
in
custody
of
the
armed
forces
serving
a
sentence
imposed
by
a
court-martial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
that
i
know
of.
i
think
that's
what
the
--
i
think
that's
what
the
--
the
previous
section
meant.
and
that
because
the
1898
statute,
which
i
read
to
the
court
a
minute
ago
and
which
appears
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
carries
that
same
thought
of
the
--
in
the
custody
of
the
army
but
precedes
and
succeeds
this
1916
provision
or
1920,
the
one
that's
before
us
now,
all
speak
of
custody
of
the
--
of
the
army.
and
in
fact,
whaty
secretary
of
war
alger
asked
for
was
why
they
were
in
custody
of
--
of
the
armies
that
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
--
is
about.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
military
just
have
ceded
jurisdiction
off
with
the
custody
of
a
man
they
no
longer
have
the
problems
of
--
of
maintaining
discipline.
then
they've
handed
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
was
the
basic
reason
for
having
the
statute
--
to
having
--
giving
this
jurisdiction
as
secretary
of
--
of
war
alger
requested
it,
yes.
and
alger
controlled
prisoners
under
their
--
under
their
custody.
they
felt
they
needed
to
have
the
power
of
the
court-martial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
draw
any
comparison.
the
statement
which
he
made
and
it
was
sent
to
the
house
committee
involved
in
this
matter
is
printed
in
our
brief
at
page
28.
and
he
merely
stated
that
he
felt
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
insubordination
in
order
not
to
impair
the
effect
of
military
imprisonment
to
give
this
power
to
the
army.
and
he
drew
no
comparisons
with
the
--
with
civilians.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
so.
i
--
i've
read
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
entire
letter.
it's
a
short
letter
but
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
that's
right.
there
is
no
comparison
drawn.
i
mean,
it
--
he
didn't
draw
any
comparison
here
anymore
than
he
would
have
as
to
the
difference
between
military
jurisdiction,
court-martial
jurisdiction
and
--
and
civilian
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
other
members
of
the
army.
i
mean,
he
felt
that
the
army
should
be
given
disciplinary
powers
if
it
becomes
necessary
but
--
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
he
was
dealing
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
he
was
dealing
with
this
particular
aspect
of
it.
there
is
no
question
of
it.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that
gets
back
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
reasonable
for
congress
to
give
the
armed
forces
the
discretion
as
to
whether
to
keep
the
man
in
a
disciplinary
barrack
or
send
him
on
to
a
federal
prison.
if
they
are
going
to
give
the
army
that
authority,
as
they
did
and
as
they
still
do,
why,
then,
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
give
the
--
the
authorities
who
are
going
to
maintain
--
who
are
going
to
be
responsible
for
maintaining
the
order
in
response
to
the
powers
to
maintain
it,
and
the
army
doesn't
need
that
power
with
respect
to
prisoners
who
are
in
the
federal
prison.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
it
does
so
much
with
--
with
--
it
may
be
that
it
was
more
dangerous
but
it
dealt
more
with
the
nature
of
their
crime.
if
they
were
people
who
were
--
i
hesitate
to
use
this
kind
of
term,
but
were
bad
people
who
would
corrupt
other
prisoners,
who
were
delinquent
in
the
sense
that
they
were
--
would
be
locked
up
in
a
civilian
light
and
--
and
kept
from
contaminating
other
people,
the
idea
of
one
is
--
if
they
were
felons,
real
felons,
they
should
be
sent
to
federal
prisons.
this
is
spelled
out
in
some
detail
in
--
in
the
statute.
i
don't
think
i
--
i
don't
think
i
cite
that
statute
in
the
--
in
my
brief
but
it's
readily
available
in
the
--
it
appears
in
the
articles
of
war,
and
i
can
find
it
in
a
minute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
reading
--
reading
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
reading
the
record
in
this
case,
i
wondered
the
same
thing.
i
mean,
it
seems
as
though
this
--
if
they
did
send
people
to
--
to
civilian
prisons
as
though
this
was
the
type
of
case
they
might
well
have
done.
but
they
--
they
found
the
judgment.
he
was
court-martialed
in
--
the
first
time
in
europe
and
--
and
france,
i
believe.
and
they
may
have
had
a
policy.
there
may
have
been
so
many,
i
don't
know.
but
anyway,
they
--
they
did
decide
to
--
to
--
at
that
time,
they
make
a
determination
that
can't
be
changed
afterwards.
they
can't
change
the
place
of
imprisonment
after
it
is
designated
by
the
officer
making
the
executing
sentence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
couldn't
at
that
time
under
the
law
as
it
read
at
that
time.
what
they
can
do
under
the
present
regulations,
i
don't
know.
but
as
far
as
this
man
is
concerned,
a
case
before
this
court,
the
executing
authority
stated
prior
to
the
imprisonment.
and
there
was
no
authority
thereafter
that
changed
as
imprisonment
for
putting
in
a
federal
prison.
he
had
to
stay
in
the
military
barrack.
he
could
be
shift
from
one
--
shifted
from
one
military
barrack,
detention
barrack
to
another
disciplinary
barracks
to
another
but
he
couldn't
be
sent
to
a
federal
prison
after
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
well,
no,
he
was
--
he
was
actually
sentenced
to
death
by
the
--
by
the
court-martial
and
it
was
commuted
by
the
president
and
at
that
time,
he
was
sent
to
alcatraz.
mr.
john
f.
davis
by
the
order
of
the
execution
of
offense.
right.
but
that
was
on
the
second
--
on
the
second
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
offense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
well,
i
think
he
would
be
punished
in
federal
courts
as
--
for
under
the
assimilative
crimes
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
is
so.
there
may
be
a
--
i
--
i
couldn't
answer
your
question
because
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
it
but
i
am
guessing
that
it
would
either
be
under
the
assimilative
crimes
statute
or
else,
there
would
be,
and
i
haven't
looked
at
it,
some
specific
federal
regulation
dealing
with
homicide
on
--
in
this
type
of
government
establishment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
would
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
right.
in
many
states,
i
thought,
they
wouldn't
have
a
death
penalty.
it'd
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
many
ways
whether
he
is
tried
in
--in
the
court-martial
of
the
civil
--
civilian
court,
criminal
courts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
i
--
i
think
what
--
what
secretary
alger
was
saying
is
this,
and
he
wasn't
dealing
of
course
specifically
with
capital
--
capital
crimes,
he
was
dealing
generally
with
problems
of
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
behavior
of
military
prisoners.
and
i
think
what
he
was
--
meant
that
he
is
saying
was
if
we
have
no
authority
to
court-martial
with
these
prisoners,
all
that
we
can
do
in
order
to
maintain
discipline
is
to
make
them
uncomfortable,
do
solitary
confinement,
labor,
things
like
that.
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
--
under
our
system,
under
our
powers,
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
hold
any
larger
cover
with
their
heads
so
as
to
keep
them
in
order.
and
he
said
we
have
had
it
in
the
military
prisons
because
in
the
previous
law
that
had
been
given,
we
have
--
we
no
longer
have
it
because
they're
sending
them
to
the
guardhouses.
now,
in
--
in
order
to
maintain
our
discipline,
we
--
we
need
to
continue
this
power.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
is
quite
true,
it's
quite
true,
your
honor,
that
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
capital
crimes,
murder,
things
that
would
be
crimes
in
the
jurisdiction
that
they
would
be
subject
to
civilian
criminal
trials
and
he
doesn't
address
himself
to
whether
or
not
that
would
be
an
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
this
situation.
he
--
he
merely
felt
that
the
army
needed
this
authority.
mr.
john
f.
davis
for
they
would
have
--
they
would
have
the
ordinary
jailers'
jurisdiction
to
maintain
order,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
they
would
have
no
power
to
extend
the
sentence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
he
felt
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
he
felt
it's
necessary
for
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
that
there
would
be
any
great
difference.
the
--
the
secretary
of
war
alger
felt
that
the
military
having
jurisdiction
of
soldiers,
the
military
should
have
this
jurisdiction
of
these
people.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
whether
that's
--
i'm
not
sure
that
he
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
not
sure
that
the
question
of
constitutionality
depends
upon
whether
this
is
absolutely
necessary.
i
mean
they
come
to
this
question
of
constitutionality
and
--
and
i
want
to
discuss
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
was
but
i
didn't
get
to
this
--
but
you
have
assumed
in
your
--
in
your
question,
i
believe,
that
in
order
to
uphold
this
power,
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
find
that
there's
no
other
way
of
handling
this
problem.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
wouldn't
base
my
argument
on
that
--
on
that
necessity,
mr.
justice
black.
i
--
i
think
that's
--
i
think
this
background
is
necessary
to
understand
why
they
asked
for
it
but
i
--
i
think
that
the
authority,
the
authority
of
congress
to
pass
this
law
is
and
under
its
laws
to
make
rules
for
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces,
and
that
looked
at
fairly
and
squarely,
this
man
is
a
--
is
in
the
land
and
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
and
therefore,
this
is
the
military
authority
to
exercise
this
type
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
they
could
not
call
him
to
fight.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
they
could.
they
could
put
in
under
the
--
under
the
system
there.
they
can
have
the
military
training
in
these
--
in
these
camps.
it's
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
statutory
purposes
of
the
camp.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
is
--
he
is
not
--
he'd
do
it
as
a
prisoner
or
as
--
he'd
do
it
in
this
capacity
which
he
is
in,
in
this
--
in
this
disciplinary
barrack.
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
make
a
conclusion
one
way
or
the
other.
that
is
my
--
my
argument
is
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
now,
this
court
has
had
this
very
question,
this
precise
question
under
this
precise
article
of
war
before
it
before
in
kahn
against
anderson
after
the
first
world
war.
and
the
facts
in
that
case
are
almost
precisely
the
same
as
--
as
the
facts
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
and
in
that
case,
the
same
arguments
as
to
lack
of
--
of
constitutional
power
will
presented
to
this
court,
and
the
court
found
that
this
did
fall
within
the
powers
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
government
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
and
that
finding
of
the
court
was
buttressed
by
court
of
appeals'
decisions
which
preceded
it,
dicta
of
the
supreme
court
itself
which
preceded
it
and
it
has
been
followed
thereafter
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
only
authority
to
the
contrary
so
far
as
i
know
on
this
question
of
jurisdiction
is
colonel
winthrop.
colonel
winthrop,
in
his
--
in
his
book,
definitely
says
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
type
of
case.
now,
undoubtedly,
undoubtedly,
the
reason
that
we
have
troubled
with
this
case
today
is
because
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
toth
case
and
in
reid
against
covert.
and
i
don't
have
to
tell
the
court
that
these
--
on
the
facts,
those
cases
are
--
are
clearly
distinguishable
from
this.our
question
is
whether
in
theory,
they
cover
it.
the
--
the
reid
against
covert
case,
of
course,
dealt
with
the
wife
--
the
wife
of
an
officer
--
of
an
--
of
an
officer
who
had
never
--
the
wife
had
never
been
in
the
army
services
and
the
question
was
whether
because
she
was
--
along
with
the
army
services
whether
she
was
closely
enough
connected
to
be
within
the
military
power.
and
the
toth
case
on
the
other
hand
dealt
with
a
--
with
a
soldier
who
had
been
retuned
to
civilian
life.
the
--
the
army
had
--
not
only
discharged
him
but
had
released
any
authority
over
in
mcculloch
and
they
attempted
to
regain
their
authority.
in
the
toth
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
footnote
which
refers
to
the
type
of
jurisdiction
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
it
refers
to
the
case
of
kahn
against
anderson,
which
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
and
without,
in
any
way,
testing
any
question
upon
its
authority,
recognizes
that
that
is
a
decision
of
--
of
this
court.
i
think
that
it
really
advances
our
argument
very
little
for
the
petitioner
to
rely
on
colonel
winthrop's
assertion
that
a
dishonorable
--
dishonorably
discharged
prisoner
is
a
civilian
and
therefore
not
subject
to
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
this
is
really
only
a
--
a
way
of
stating
a
conclusion.
there's
no
question
that
a
dishonorable
discharge
terminates
military
benefits
generally
but
whether
it
ends
the
power
to
impose
discipline
as
such
is
the
very
question
which
is
before
this
court,
and
we
could
turn
this
argument
around
and
say
that
since
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
vital
test
of
membership
might
well
be
whether
a
person
is
subject
to
discipline
at
the
very
fact
that
there
is
an
imposition
of
discipline
over
these
prisoners
makes
them
members
of
the
armed
forces.
the
--
the
army
as
--
has,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
has
coupled
dishonorable
discharges
with
the
discipline
of
imprisonment
for
--
for
many
years.
and
this
court
is
specifically
recognized
that
the
coupling
of
a
dishonorable
discharge
and
an
imprisonment
is
--
is
not
an
inconsistent
act
and
that
the
military
forces
have
authority
to
do
this.
so
that
i
think
it
is
clear
beyond
any
question
that
there
is
no
intent.
there
is
no
intent
on
the
part
of
the
armed
forces
to
sever
the
disciplinary
relationship
between
the
soldier
and
the
armed
forces
when
they
sentenced
him
to
dishonorable
discharge
and
imprisonment
for
a
period
of
years.
they
specifically
wished
to
maintain
the
--
the
disciplinary
relationship
over
him.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
well,
i
won't
be
sure
i
answer
your
question
correctly.
the
sentence
has
these
two
elements
in
it.
there
is
a
separate
dishonorable
--
then
the
man
is
in
prison
then
a
dishonorable
discharge
of
a
document
which
is
called
a
dishonorable
discharge,
i
haven't
seen
it
but
i
--
i
think
this
is
so,
a
document
is
filled
out
in
proper
places
and
forwarded
to
his
fine.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
when
these
are
coupled
together
in
this
way,
it
shows
an
intent
that
the
dishonorable
discharge
shall
not
terminate
the
disciplinary
powers
terminate
the
relationship
between
the
member
of
the
armed
forces
and
the
armed
forces
by
being
executed,
otherwise,
the
--
he
would
presumably
be
released
from
--
from
prisons
and
said
have
no
authority
even
to
hold
him
in
that
prison.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
reason
i
think
i
phrased
made
--
changed
my
phraseology
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
there
is
not
question
that
a
dishonorable
discharge
ends
a
great
many
of
the
aspects
of
a
man's
military
career.
the
very
purpose
of
a
dishonorable
discharge
is
to
make
this
man
no
longer
subject
to
getting
pay,
pension
rights,
the
honorable
status
of
a
member
of
going
to
defend,
going
to
fight
for
the
--
for
the
people.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
except
there
is
--
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
there
is
no
intention
to
release
this
man
from
the
custody
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
army.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
a
little
more.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
court
said
it
made
no
difference.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
was
--
the
court
didn't
determine.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
whether
or
not
a
man
is
still
a
member
or
in
the
armed
forces,
it's
--
it's
sometimes
not
easy
to
determine.
this
is
one
aspect
of
the
case
which
we
have
before
us.
but
there
are
--
there
are
many
situations
where
the
man
can't
be
sent
to
--
to
fight
overseas,
can't
be
ought
to
do
this,
can't
be
ought
to
do
that.
i
think
one
of
the
prime
examples,
one
of
the
things
that
strikes
me
is
the
question
with
respect
to
prisoners
of
war
who
are
also
subject
under
the
law
to
--
to
army
court-martial.
now,
prisoners
of
war,
of
course,
guilty
of
no
crime
whatsoever,
i
mean,
they
kept
in,
enemy
soldiers
who
have
been
captured.and
under
--
in
the
national
convention,
they
are
entitled
to
many
rights
and
--
and
privileges
as
prisoners
of
war
but
they
are
also
subject
to
military
court-martial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
yes,
of
course,
they'd
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
they
--
but
--
but
these
are
not
punished
under
the
war
power,
your
honor.
these
are
power
--
these
--
these
people
are
subject
to
the
--
the
military
disciplines
under
the
power
to
--
to
govern
the
--
the
land
and
naval
forces
of
the
united
states.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
(inaudible)
war
angled
through
thoroughly
but
i
(inaudible)
prisoner
of
war
in
this
country
(inaudible)
with
respect
to
the
constitution.
he
has
a
--
he
has
a
--
if
--
if
he
is
in
the
--
just
as
any
alien
in
this
country
is,
he
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
and
in
order
to
have
authority
to
try
these
men
by
court-martial
with
the
--
with
the
methods,
the
procedures
which
are
followed
there
and
are
not
applicable
to
civilian,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
find
that
pro
tanto
and
to
a
certain
extent,
a
prisoner
of
war
too
is
part
of
our
--
of
our
own
land
and
naval
forces.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
mean
like
in
the
toth
situation?
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
must
--
i
must
say
that
--
i
think
we
mustn't
assume
that
he
is
no
longer
a
part.
i
think
that
is
our
question
whether
he
is
so
--
he
is
so
--
he
is
now
so
intimately
connected
so
closely
associated
to
the
aspects
of
military
life
impinged
on
him
so
thoroughly
that
he
is
still
in
the
armed
forces.
in
my
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
he
is
still
in
the
armed
forces
while
is
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
after
he
has
been
discharged?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
mean
aside
from
the
--
this
particular
issue
which
is
before
us,
which
is
precisely
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
the
terms
of
service
frequently
changed
with
respect
to
officers
as
far
as
i
know
with
respect
to
enlisted
men
in
time
of
war
as
i
--
and
that
one
subject
to
military
discipline
if
it's
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
--
the
country.
and
this,
i
haven't
checked
again
but
i
would
--
my
recollection
is
that
during
world
war
ii,
the
question
of
when
one
would
be
released
was
in
the
hands
of
the
armed
forces
rather
than
a
matter
of
contract
between
the
individual
and
the
--
certainly
with
respect
to
officers
applies.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
i
would
have
to
check
whether
there
was
any
(inaudible)
of
--
of
enlistment
during
the
war.
i
don't
know
whether
an
enlisted
man
--
how
--
how
that
applies
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
was
the
customary
way
to
handle
this
type
of
situation
there.
but
to
give
you
a
little
full
answer,
i
want
to
say
that
in
certain
cases,
there
was
a
suspension
of
the
execution
of
the
discharge
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
soldier
could
be
rehabilitated
and
returned
to
the
armed
forces.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
in
the
execution,
i
believe.
i
think
that
was
not
in
the
--
i
think
that
wasn't
in
the
--
i'm
sure
it
wasn't
in
the
sentence.
that
was
in
the
execution
of
the
sentence
that
they
would
suspend
it
and
--
and
try
to
get
the
man
back
into
the
service.
actually
what
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
the
execution
in
--
in
the
--
the
officer
who
would
execute
the
sentence
was
--
withhold
this
development
and
tell
--
who
would
determine
whether
or
not
the
man
could
be
rehabilitated.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
a
matter
of
discretion
under
regulations,
i
presume.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
this
--
in
this
type
of
case
where
the
long
term
of
imprisonment,
the
provision
would
--
would
rather
be
that
the
discharged
would
be
executed
and
then
if
the
term
of
imprisonment
for
a
good
behavior
because
the
man
proved
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
good
soldier,
if
the
term
of
imprisonment
was
--
was
reduced
as
the
armed
forces
had
--
had
the
right
to
do,
by
then,
he
would
be
reenlisted
and
the
reenlistment
would
take
effect
for
the
unexpired
portion
of
this
prior
enlistment.
there'd
be
a
--
actual
reenlistment
in
that
so
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that's
provided,
i
may
say,
in
the
statute
itself.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
what
the
law
contemplated.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
this
--
this
procedure
for
reenlisting
a
man,
a
--
a
prisoner
who
has
--
who
has
proved
that
he
has
rehabilitated.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i'm
sure
there
were
directions
with
respect
to
it,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
from
the
army
--
from
the
barrack
officers
(inaudible)
of
the
secretary
of
the
army.
i
may
say
that
in
one
side
of
these
cases
is
--
as
--
as
i
analyze
the
basis,
it's
very
different
from
the
reid
case,
reid
against
covert
case
or
toth
in
that
here,
we
have,
i
believe,
no
attempt
by
congress
to
expand
--
expand
the
area
of
its
jurisdiction.
it's
--
it's
rather
a
matter
of
carrying
through
jurisdiction
which
is
specifically
and
--
and
concededly
granted
to
it
with
--
with
respect
to
armed
members
of
the
armed
forces
to
carry
this
thing
--
to
carry
that
very
jurisdiction
through
until
determination
of
their
imprisonment.
now,
i
think
when
i
was
talking
about
whether
congress
intended
to
--
i'm
turning
now
to
the
point
i
was
discussing
last
night
about
article
92
which
limits
the
military
jurisdiction
of
a
murder
to
--
so
that
it
excludes
“in
time
of
peace”,
and
i
think
i
neglected
to
mention
one
thing
which
i
think
is
--
is
rather
important
and
that
is
that
when
congress
amended
the
articles
of
war
in
1948,
it
specifically
recognized
that
with
respect
to
the
articles
of
war,
the
war
was
still
in
progress,
and
it
did
this
in
connection
with
article
53
providing
for
applications
for
new
trials.
and
there
was
a
thought
that
maybe
during
hostilities,
many
court-martials
have
been
hurriedly
conducted
and
that
it
was
appropriate
to
give
soldiers
who
had
gone
through
those
court-martials
a
chance
to
have
them
looked
at
in
more
calm
--
in
a
--
in
a
more
calm
atmosphere.
and
so
in
article
53,
they
gave
soldiers
opportunity
to
petition
for
new
trials
under
article
53,
and
they
limited
the
time
there.
and
they
limited
it
to
--
within
one
year
after
the
termination
of
the
war
sometime
in
the
future.
they
recognize
the
war
was
still
in
existence
and
they
were
giving
this
right
in
the
future
until
one
year
after
determination
of
the
war.
and
again
in
1950,
when
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
was
--
was
adopted,
again,
congress,
in
dealing
with
applications
for
new
trials,
specifically
recognized
that
with
respect
to
the
articles
of
war,
peace
had
not
been
achieved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
