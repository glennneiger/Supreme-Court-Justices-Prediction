is
it

is
this
implied,
mr.
hannon
that
if
the
answer
is
yes,
either
or
both
of
those
questions
suspends
the
military

justice

black
you
have
the
statutes
that
were
changed
printed
in
your
brief?
justice

yes.

now.

(voice

to
be
in
--
when
they
should
--
can
be
tried
by
court-martial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
it
two
together
as
it
was
and
is
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
history
connected
to
that
thing?
what's
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
--
what
--
what's
explained
to
be
the
difference
in
power
when
the
--
the
--
in
a
state
--
confined
in
a
state
prison,
confined
in
a
military
prison?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

tied
all
together
with
the
idea
of
discipline.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
reason
did
he
give
why
the
--
it
can
be
better
disciplinary
action
for
court-martial
and
signed
in
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
--
this
is
--
you
quoted
here
practically
everything
that's
relevant
to
you?
have
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
thing
that
you
--
that
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
but
if
it's
based
on
the
fact
that
discipline
requires
the
--
that
jurisdiction
to
be
exercised,
that's
not
a
question
then
of
how
he
felt
about
the
general
power,
it's
--
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
based
it
on
that
side.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
i
don't
quite
get
the
--
if
this
is
the
only
reason
they
give,
i'm
--
i
can't
quite
understand
the
premise
on
which
he
says
that
this
was
encouraged
insubordination,
if
you're
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
reasonableness
of
it.
what
he
says
is
to
announce
to
the
prisoner
that
no
matter
what
he
may
do,
he
cannot
have
the
term
of
it
in
confinement
extended
as
a
direct
encouragement
insubordination
and
must
impair
the
effect
of
military
imprisonment
as
an
exemplary
punishment
but
he
could
be
punished
and
could
be
sentenced
to
death.
why?
why
would
that
--
encouraged
him
to
insubordination
to
be
tried?
on
--
what
is
the
basis
for
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
minor
things
that
you
are
speaking
about,
they
--
they
would
have
anyhow.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
a
source?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
couldn't
extend
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--but
the
courts
would
have
power
to
extend
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
will
be
(inaudible)
to
be
punished.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
he
--
virtue
would
there
be
in
a
or
deter
would
there
be
that
you
can
imagine
the
man
knowing
that
he
is
going
--
if
he's
going
to
be
sentenced
for
10
years,
that
in
one
instance,
he's
going
to
be
sentenced
under
military
judgment,
in
another
instance,
by
conviction
for
a
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
there
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
he
felt
they
should
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
his
reason
was
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
you're
discussing
it
now
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
took
your
--
i
took
your
words,
reasonably
related
to
the
extension
of
the
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
the
reasonable
--
if
you
have
to
depend
on
the
idea
that
somehow,
it's
a
greater
punishment
for
a
man
to
have
a
military
judgment
over
him
than
a
--
than
a
civil
judgment,
i
don't
quite
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
call
him
to
fight?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
call
on
to
participate
in
any
way,
in
any
military
activity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
he
that
as
a
prisoner
or
as
a
soldier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
you
recognize
in
your
correction
of
your
sentence
that
there
is
probably
a
difference
between
determination
of
all
relationship
as
to
the
man
who
has
been
in
the
army
and
a
termination
of
his
relationship
as
a
member
of
the
army.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
wise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
any
other
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
it's
--
supposing
that's
true,
that
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
the
court
said
in
the
kahn
case.
i
can
find
no
reason
except
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
there
a
discharge
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
was
there
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
understand
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
--
that
the
court
just
brightly
admit
from
the
fact
that
they
had
--
they
charged,
that
he
was
a
military
prisoner
to
the
statement
and
that
settled
it
and
which
was
frequently
the
case
in
the
--
some
of
the
opinions.
and
that
is
settled,
its
being
a
military
prisoner,
they
had
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
he
had
not
been
part
of
the
army
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
says
a
prisoner
of
war
who
has
never
been
here
taking
in
fight,
fighting
against
this
country
who
haven't
come
here
and
never
has
been
a
part
of
the
armed
forces,
they
can
try
him,
i
understand,
but
a
soldier
who
has
been
a
part
of
the
armed
forces
but
they
put
out
and
who
has
been
in
this
country
all
his
life
can
be
tried
by
them
too
on
that
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
a
man
--
this
--
this
man
here
who's
been
discharged
and
not
a
part
of
it
merely
because
they
decide
to
keep
him
in
prison
for
a
crime
that
he
has
committed
when
he
was
under
their
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
any
statute
that's
ever
been
passed
in
the
country
and
draft
law
or
anywhere
else
that
says
that
a
--
and
that's
i
presumed
settled
the
status
as
a
folio,
i'm
not
talking
about
now
as
a
prisoner,
that
indicates
that
the
army
can
take
a
man
in
and
keep
him
there
beyond
the
term
of
service
of
other
people
who
get
in
as
a
soldier
and
after
he's
been
discharged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
after
he's
been
discharged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
he
put
--
can
the
army
project
the
term
of
his
service
over
his
objection
or
even
with
his
objection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
issue
--
this
issue
to
me
is
quite
a
difference
because
it's
the
power
over
prisoner.
so
which
kind
of
trial
a
prisoner
will
have
who
is
no
longer
a
soldier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
officers
who
volunteered
their
services
and
went
in
and
the
statute
provided
they
should
be
there
for
some
term
or
some
fixed
--
something
fixed
by
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
asking
is
if
there's
any
of
the
statute
that
ever
been
passed
that
indicates
that
the
army
can
keep
an
enlisted
man.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
unfortunately,
that
doesn't
question
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
take
on
that
part
and
say
that
there
is
no
third
class?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
what's
called
the
cb
and
not
a
--not
a
soldier
though
or
somebody
who
just
doesn't
work
under
the
army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
he
is
not
in
the
--
suppose
there's
no
paper
enlisted,
but
he
take
(inaudible)8
he
goes
to
the
army
and
he
is
part
of
it.
suppose
they
decide
not
to
have
him
enlisted
and
not
use
those
papers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
civilian?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
--
is
that
a
part
of
your
case
here?
