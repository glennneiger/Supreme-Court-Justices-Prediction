justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
perhaps
what
you
really
mean
is
that
he
is
not
in
the
armed
services
within
the
power
of
congress
to
prescribe
rules
regulating
the
armed
--
the
army
and
navy
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
after
he's
been
discharged.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
you
really
mean,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
that
constitutionally
he
is
within
the
power
of
the
armed
forces
under
rules
prescribed
by
congress
so
long
as
he's
in
the
army.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
when
he's
been
discharged,
he's
out
and
there
is
no
constitutional
power,
is
that
your
argument?
