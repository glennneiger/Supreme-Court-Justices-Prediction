justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
it.
so,
i'm
sorry.
that
it
is
--
is
this
dying
declaration
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
consider
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
part
of
his
brown
book
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
before
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
the
case
be
different
if
that
had
been
so?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
you
to
say,
(inaudible)
if
the
sentence
had
been
a
dishonorable
discharge
was
to
become
effective
after
he
served
his
sentence
that
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what's
the
constitutional
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
explain
it
to
me
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
we
have
now
before
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
the
factual
difference,
of
course,
but
i'm
asking
you
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
constitutional
difference,
the
legal
difference
between
those
two
situations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
military
has
no
relation
to
him
in
the
case
that
we
have
because
of
the
way
the
sentence
was
framed,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he's
still
a
part
of
the
military
establishment
except
in
the
sense
that
he's
not
on
active
duty
but
he's
incarcerated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
at
all
times
and
whether
he
is
a
soldier,
quoting
your
word?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that's
the
test,
constitutional
test,
of
whether
it's
rational
for
congress
to
conclude
as
it
has
since
1873,
that
a
person
situated
as
this
man
is
should
be
subject
to
--
should
be
subject
to
military
discipline.
do
you
would
think
that
the
test
is
whether
it's
essential
to
the
preservation
of
military
discipline?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
we
have
supply
that
it's
absolutely
essential
to
military
discipline
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
if
we
reject
your
first
branch
of
the
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
know
of
any
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
davis,
i
wasn't
quite
i
understood
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
you
say
that
if
he
committed
the
crime
now,
he
could
not
be
tried
by
court-martial,
that's
by
a
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
is
confined
in
alcatraz,
a
civilian
prisoner
and
not
because
the
statute
has
been
changed
in
respect
to
military
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
establishments,
is
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
that
--
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
isn't
my
question.
if
a
soldier
is
confined
to
an
exclusively
military
prison
at
the
present
time,
he's
still
would
be
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
all
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
present
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
those
two
aspects
of
a
sentence
part
of
the
same
physical
document?
justice
john
m.
harlan
part
of
the
judgment
of
the
court-martial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
judgment
of
the
court-martial
included
in
it
imprisonment
and
dishonorable
discharge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
you
are
suggesting,
i
take
it,
from
your
argument
now
is
that
the
point
of
substance
looking
at
this
thing,
the
discharge
should
be
reviewed
just
as
if
it
had
written
into
it,
“your
discharge
is
honorably,”
and
at
the
same
time
served
20
years
for
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
whatever
it
is,
for
this
for
this
crime.
