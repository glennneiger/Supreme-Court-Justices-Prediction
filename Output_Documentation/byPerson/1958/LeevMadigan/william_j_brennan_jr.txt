justice

it's
a

justice

does
it

justice

j.

is
it
relevant
to
the
issue
we
have
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
all
we
know
is
he
committed
some
offense
for
which
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gets
court-martialed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
court-martialed
again
for
another
offense
at
cooke?

william
j.
brennan,

--
it
took

took
place
at
cooke?
justice
william

and

but
there's
no
--
there
was
no
issue
as
to
whether
he
was
rightly
or
wrongly
convicted
is
there
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
it
all
goes
to
jurisdiction
to
try
him
by
court-martial
rather
than
in
civil
court,
isn't
that
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
we're
not
concerned
with
the
merits
or
otherwise
but
the
offense
for
which
he
was
charged
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
i
thought
you
said
before,
there's
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
of
course,
you
answered
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
mr.
justice
harlan
earlier
that
it's
black
and
white.
once
he's
--
he's
discharged
from
the
army,
he's
out
--
he
must
be
a
civilian
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
usually
congress
could
give
no
power
to
the
court
for
an
offense
committed
at
the
time
that
he
committed
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
that
time
he
committed
it,
he
was
not
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what's
trial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
actually
giving
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
while
in
the
service,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
instead
of
being
at
camp
cooke,
if
he
were
at
a
camp
in
confinement,
let's
say
in
some
theater
overseas
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
might
have
a
different
case,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
mean
that
might
apply
even
if
you're
confined
to
a
(inaudible)
because
that's
not
the
case
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
how
--
how
was
it
--
is
it
lee
now
confined
at
alcatraz?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
no
question
that
at
the
time
of
this
offense
--
camp
cooke,
is
that
what
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
exclusively
military.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
army
only
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
the
personnel
charged
with
the
administration
and
operation
of
--
of
these
disciplinary
barracks?
were
they
all
military
personnel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
know,
mr.
davis,
whether
in
1949,
it
was
sometimes
the
practice
to
confine
men
like
this
to
civilian
prison?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
i'm
not
sure
it's
highly
relevant
but
if
there
were
no
court-martial
jurisdiction
for
this
offense
of
murder
and
there
had
to
be
trial
on
the
civil
court,
what
would
be
the
substantive
offense
of
murder?
not
the
provision
of
article
92,
i
take
it,
as
to
punishment
and
such
but
something
else
would
have

william
j.
brennan,

california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
assimilative
crimes
act
in
a
state
like
michigan
made
quite
a
difference,
wouldn't
it,
whether
it's
tried
by
court-martial
or
by
civil
court?
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
michigan
has
no
death
penalty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
hannon,
i
don't
understand
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
didn't
understand.
i
--
mr.
davis'
argument
may
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
but
i
thought
what
he
was
suggesting
was
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
congress
had
in
mind
that
in
any
event,
the
story
is
not
--
the
war
had
not
ended,
not
necessarily
that
it
was
the
date
of
--
as
of
official
termination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
want
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
assume
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

that's
why
i
understood,
mr.
davis.
