mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
honorable
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
--
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
--
ninth
circuit
wherein
that
court
affirmed
the
decree
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
which
dismissed
the
petitioner's
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
in
order
to
bring
the
court
up-to-date,
i'd
like
to
briefly
relate
the
facts
surrounding
this
case.
the
petitioner
is
now
in
prison
in
the
alcatraz
penitentiary,
alcatraz
island
california.
the
petitioner
was
inducted
into
the
army
in
october
of
1942.
he
was
sent
overseas
and
in
may
the
27th,
1945,
shortly
after
the
war
ended
in
europe,
he
was
brought
to
trial
by
court
--
by
a
general
court-martial
which
convened
in
paris,
france
and
was
charged
with
having
been
involved
in
a
robbery
and
an
assault.
he
was
convicted
by
the
general
court-martial
and
was
sentenced
to
dishonorable
discharge
from
the
army
and
35
years
of
confinement
with
hard
labor.
in
1946,
he
was
returning
from
paris,
france
and
was
confined
to
the
united
states
disciplinary
barracks
at
camp
cooke,
california
which
is
lombard,
about
midway
between
los
angeles
and
san
francisco.
in
--
on
june
the
12th,
1947,
approximately
a
year
after
he
had
been
confined
to
lombard
camp
cooke,
california
for
disciplinary
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
it's
--
it's
a
--
what
we
call
a
disciplinary
barracks,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
yes,
it's
a
military
establishment.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
there
--
there
used
to
be
in
world
war
ii,
i
understand.
however,
i
don't
think
there
is
very
much
there
at
that
time.
in
1947
--
june
of
1947,
approximately
a
year
after
he
had
been
admitted
there,
upon
his
return
from
overseas,
he
was
dishonorably
discharged
from
the
service.
that
is
a
dishonorable
discharge
was
executed
and
it
was
mailed
to
him
and
placed
in
his
personal
file
there
at
camp
cooke,
california.
in
--
in
june
of
1949,
approximately
two
years
after
he
was
dishonorably
discharged,
three
fellow
prisoners
stabbed
another
prisoner
to
death.
the
petitioner
john
lee
took
no
active
part
in
the
affray,
whatsoever,
as
is
evidenced
by
a
dying
declaration,
which
for
some
reason
was
not
admitted
into
trial
in
the
original
court-martial.
although
he
took
no
active
part
in
this
affray,
whatsoever,
in
fact
according
to
the
dying
declaration
here,
that
even
states
that
he
attempted
--
he
did
what
he
could
to
stop
it,
before,
i
quote
from
it
either
where
the
victim
said,
“lee
didn't
take
no
--
lee
didn't
do
no
cutting
but
he
was
there.
he
was
trying
to
tell
--
trying
to
make
them
stop,”
and
words
to
that
effect.
but,
nevertheless,
in
spite
of
that
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
well
if
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
--
may
--
mr.
justice,
they
have
reason
it
was
not
admitted
although
i
say
it
was
a
dying
declaration.
it
was
not
admitted
for
the
reason
that
the
last
sentence
that
--
in
the
last
statement
that
they
had
made,
before
he
went
into
the
hospital
or
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
it
--
it
is
attached
to
the
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
yes,
it
--
it
was
the
--
and
it
was
before
the
lower
court
too
but
was
not
before
the
court-martial.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
is
it
--
is
it
relevant
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
oh,
it
--
it
is
not.
it
is
--
it's
only
a
question
of
fact,
your
honor.
this
is
a
legal
question
before
the
court.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
for
which
--
for
which
he
was
court-martialed
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
he
was
--
he
was
dishonorably
discharged.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
two
years
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
yes,
which
took
place
some
two
years
after
he
was
dishonorably
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
at
camp
cooke,
california.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
the
--
the
only
issue
before
the
court
today,
your
honor.
there
are
two
issues.
the
first
issue
is
the
interpretation
of
article
of
war
92
which
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
no
--
no,
your
honor.
there
are
two
issues
before
the
court
here
today,
gentlemen.
the
first
issue
is
the
--
is
the
interpretation
of
article
of
war
92,
which
although,
in
our
brief
we
have
stated
that
really
as
effect
and
issue,
we
have
chosen
to
discuss
that
first
and
i'd
like
to
discuss
that
with
you,
gentlemen.
and
the
other
issue
as
to
the
interpretation
of
article
2
(e)
will
be
taken
up
by
mr.
hannon.
the
reason
i've
two
is
to
discuss
92
first,
is
because
i
think
the
court
will
see
that
if
that
probably
has
to
be
passed
upon
before
they
can
reach
article
2
(e).
i'd
like
to
read
at
article
92
from
the
1949
manual
for
court-martial,
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
offense
for
which
the
petitioner
is
now
serving
his
life
sentence,
specifies,
“any
person,
subject
to
military
law,
found
guilty
of
murder,
shall
suffer
death
or
imprisonment
for
life
as
a
court-martial
may
direct.”
and
then
i
skip
down
the
part
that
has
--
“but
provided
that
no
person
shall
be
tried
by
court-martial
for
murder
or
rape
committed
within
the
geographical
limits
of
the
states
of
the
union
and
the
district
of
columbia
in
time
of
peace.”
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
yes,
it
does
as
it
goes
back
for
a
long
time
but
it
--
it
is
not
incorporated
into
the
1951
manual,
which
was
passed
in
may
of
1950
and
the
new
uniform
code
of
military
justice
dropped
that
provision
from
--
from
the
murder
and
rape.
but
it
--
but
it
has
been
in
there
for
many
years
prior
to
the
1951
manual.
the
--
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
ruled
in
this
case
that
on
june
the
10th,
1949
we
were
at
war.
and
we
were
not
--
it
was
not
time
of
peace
within
the
meaning
of
article
of
war
92.
and
so
that
the
general
court-martial
according
to
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
did
in
fact
have
jurisdiction
in
the
case
of
john
lee,
the
petitioner,
to
try
him
by
general
court-martial
for
the
capital
offense
of
murder
which
was
committed
in
june
--
on
june
the
10th,
1949
and
for
which
he
was
brought
to
trial
in
september
of
1949,
in
--
in
camp
cooke,
california
where
the
courts
--
the
court
--
this
court
will
take
judicial
notice
of
the
facts
at
that
time,
the
courts
were
open.
we
submit,
there
was
--
there
was
no
necessity
and
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
for
the
government
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
for
--
for
the
--
for
john
lee,
the
petitioner,
to
be
tried
by
general
court-martial
in
1949,
two
years
after
he
had
been
dishonorably
discharged.
and
some
four
years
after
the
wars
had
ended
the
--
the
war
in
europe
and
also
the
war
in
the
far
east,
the
war
in
the
far
east
having
ended
of
course
on
august
the
14th,
and
--
and
august
14th,
1945.
i
remember
it
very
well.
i
was
in
okinawa.
i
appreciate
it.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
the
--
there's
--
the
shooting
stopped
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
the
shooting
stopped
and
they
told
us
that
we
were
going
to
wait
for
our
orders
to
go
home.
and
that
is
the
point
on
which
the
--
the
government
had
rested
their
case.
they
--
they
have
made
much
capital
of
an
old
world
war
i
case
kahn
versus
anderson
255
u.s.
1.
and
they
--
they
have
contended
that
that
case
governs
the
case
at
bar.
that
in
that
particular
case
it
involved
the
--
a
petitioner
who
was
confined
in
fort
leavenworth,
kansas
during
world
war
i
in
july
prior
to
the
armistice
in
july
of
1918
wherein
--
wherein
this
--
this
man
who
was
confined
at
fort
leavenworth
was
alleged
to
have
been
involved
in
a
murder
there
at
fort
leavenworth.
he
was
brought
--
he
was
brought
to
trial
on
november
the
4th
after
this
offense
was
committed
in
--
in
july
of
1918.
and
he
was
tried
by
a
general
court-martial.
the
court-martial
took
about
21
days
with
the
delays
and
all.
so
that
the
court-martial
ended
up
by
--
on
november
the
25th,
1918.
of
course,
the
armistice
was
signed
on
november
the
11th.
well,
the
petitioner
then,
anderson,
came
into
court
and
on
a
writ
of
petition
--
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
he
said
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
war
had
ended,
before
the
sentence
was
finally
handed
down,
there
was
a
loss
of
jurisdiction.
and
the
--
and
the
court
--
the
united
states
supreme
court,
rightly
so
stated,
“no,
that
is
not
so,
because
we
had
jurisdiction
over
--
over
the
man.
it
was
in
time
of
war.
the
armistice
hadn't
even
been
signed
and
we
continued
to
have
jurisdiction.”
then
they
went
ahead
to
say,
“in
time
of
peace
means
peace
in
the
complete
sense
officially
declared.”
now,
that
--
that
is
the
case
on
which
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
petition.
i
--
i
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
think
that
they've
misinterpreted
that
case,
very
definitely,
because,
at
first
place,
it's
not
at
all
like
the
case
at
bar.
because
in
our
--
in
the
case
at
bar,
whereas
in
--
in
the
kahn
versus
anderson,
the
--
the
armistice
hadn't
even
been
signed.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
armistice
had
been
signed
about
four
--
well,
the
shooting
had
stopped
about
four
years
earlier.
the
presidential
proclamation
was
signed
in
--
on
december
the
31st,
1946.
and
the
joint
resolution
of
congress
was
passed
on
july
the
25th,
1947,
which
the
army
court-martial
itself
has
stated,
adopted
into
the
new
manual
under
article
43,
and
it
states
there
that
the
--the
joint
resolution
of
congress
of
july
the
25th,
1947,
has
the
effect
of
terminating
the
war
to
--
with
respect
to
punishment
of
certain
military
offenses
when
committed
in
time
of
war.
what
they
had
to
do
under
article
43,
which
covers
the
statute
of
limitation,
would
make
the
determination
as
to
when
--
which
offenses
are
committed
in
time
of
peace
and
which
are
committed
in
time
of
war.
the
difference
being
of
course,
those
that
are
committed
in
time
of
--
on
time
of
war,
many
of
these
offenses
do
not
have
a
statute
of
limitation,
but
in
time
of
peace
they
have
a
three-year
statute
of
limitation.
in
that
connection,
article
43
(a)
says,
“a
person
charged
with
desertion
or
absence
without
leave
in
time
of
war
or
with
aiding
the
enemy,
mutiny
or
murder
may
be
tried
and
punished
at
any
time
without
limitation.”
then
it
says
in
(b),
“except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
article
a
person
charged
with
desertion
in
time
of
peace
or
any
of
the
offenses
punishable
under
articles
119
through
132
and
they
had
included
offenses
--
offenses
such
as
–
such
as
assault,
larceny,
and
various
other
offenses
which
apart
from
being
in
time
of
war
would
have
a
three-year
limitation.”
and
the
--
and
the
footnote
says,
“an
absence
without
leave
from
7
march,
1947
to
5
february,
1949,
having
begun
on
a
date
prior
to
the
adoption
by
congress
of
the
joint
resolution
of
25
july,
1947,
terminating
the
war
with
respect
to
punishment
of
certain
military
offenses
when
committed
in
time
of
war
was
held
subject
to
the
operation
of
article
of
war
39.”
in
other
words,
they
said,
“that
because
that
absence
of
leave
or
absence
without
leave
began
on
7th
--
on
the
7th
of
march,
1947,
before
the
joint
resolution
of
congress,
that
it
was
a
wartime,
absence
without
leave.
and
hence
would
not
have
the
three-year
statute
of
limitation.”
now,
the
government
failed
to
take
into
consideration
some
very,
very
important
cases
and
some
of
the
most
important
of
which
are
the
cases
which
have
handed
--
been
handed
down
by
the
united
--
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
which
by
virtue
of
being
a
court
--
a
court
which
deals
specifically
with
military
cases,
had
come
to
be
expert
in
that
field.
and
they
have
had
to
pass
upon
the
question
of
"in
time
of
war"
or
"in
time
of
peace"
because
we
had
this
korean
conflict
that
came
on.
and
we
had
the
same
--
the
presidential
proclamation
was
passed
at
the
beginning
of
the
korean
conflict,
it
was
of
course,
in
june
the
24th,
1950,
which
stated
that
these
same
offenses
which
otherwise
would
have
been
peace
time
offenses
from
july
the
25th,
1947,
became
wartime
offenses
after
the
korean
conflict
started
as
of
june
the
24th,
1950.
so
that
--
many
--
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
has
had
to
pass
on
many
cases
involving
awol
which
occurred
after
the
korean
conflict.
awol
which
--
and
they've
--
they've
held
universally
that
that's
desertion
if
it
occurred
after
the
24th
of
june,
1950.
and
so
that's
desertion
and
because
it's
desertion,
it's
desertion
because
it
happened
“in
time
of
war.”
the
government
in
the
--
the
government
has
made
much
capital
of
the
fact
but
the
korean
conflict
was
not
a
war
because
it
--
it
wasn't
declared
to
be
a
war
as
such.
it
wasn't
started
by
presidential
proclamation
and
because
it
wasn't
ended
by
presidential
proclamation.
but,
i
--
i
submit
what
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
and
this
honorable
court
has
also
said
in
the
same
regard
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
ludecke
versus
watkins.
and
i'm
now
reading
from
--
from
page
33
of
our
brief.
in
ludecke
versus
watkins,
after
a
similar
issue
was
before
the
war
or
before
the
court
except
that
it
involves
what
we
call
war
powers
in
that
particular
case.
it
--
it
involved
the
--
the
power
of
--
of
the
aliens,
the
--
the
right
of
the
--
the
government
to
deport
an
alien
without
giving
him
a
due
process
hearing,
ludecke
versus
watkins
335
u.s.
160.
and
the
--
the
court
laid
down
the
rule
there,
the
state
of
war
may
be
terminated
by
treaty
or
legislation
or
presidential
proclamation.
and
what
they
--
what
they
said
was
any
one
of
these
things
may
terminate
the
war.
now,
the
question
is,
of
course,
the
government
contends
that
we
--
we
never
--
we
never
got
out
of
the
war
until
1952
when
the
japanese
peace
treaty
was
finally
signed
and
all
that
--
it
was
signed
in
1951,
it
became
effective
in
1952.
but
that
leaves
us
with
a
paradoxical
situation.
if
we
were
never
--
if
we
were
at
war
from
pearl
harbor
up
until
1952,
then
why
is
it
necessary
for
--
for
the
court
--
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
--
in
such
a
large
number
of
cases
to
rule
that
we
were
at
war
when
the
korean
conflict
started.
it
certainly
is
a
paradoxical
situation.
it
--
they're
hanging
their
case
on
a
mere
technicality
and
not
on
the
actualities
of
the
cases.
but
the
--
it's
very
interesting
that
one
of
the
most
--
two
of
the
most
recent
cases
in
this
connection
are
cases
that
--
which
have
been
handed
down
by
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
on
march
15th,
1957,
last
year.
that's
the
case
of
united
states
versus
shell
and
united
states
versus
boston.
in
those
two
cases,
this
very
issue
was
before
--
was
before
the
court.
when
did
the
time
of
war
for
the
korean
conflict
begin?
when
did
it
end?
because
they
again
had
the
question
of
these
offenses
which
would
carry
a
--
would
be
capital
offenses
in
time
of
war.
murder
--
murder
over
in
korea
and
desertion.
they
held
in
--
in
united
states
versus
shell
and
united
states
versus
boston,
and
i
quote,
“in
holding
that
offenses
committed
during
the
korean
conflict
were
perpetrated
during
a
time
of
war,
within
the
meaning
of
the
language
of
a
code,
we
reason
that
war
does
not
result
only
from
a
formal
declaration
of
congress
but
can
exist,
in
fact,
without
a
declaration,
and
that
its
existence
is
to
be
determined
by
the
realities
of
the
situation
as
distinguished
from
legal
license.”
now,
the
thing
that
is
especially
significant
about
that
case
is
that
they
specifically
stated
that
they
have
--
were
overruling
their
prior
holding
of
september
16th,
1954,
three
years
earlier,
wherein
that
same
issue
was
before
the
court.
and
they
had
followed,
in
that
particular
case,
they
had
followed
ludecke
versus
watkins
and
kahn
versus
anderson.
they
state
as
--
as
well
as
when
united
states
ex
rel.
knauff
v.
shaughnessy.
but
it's
very
interesting
that
the
court,
in
this
later
case,
in
1957,
in
these
two
cases,
specifically
said
that
we
overruled
our
earlier
decision
which
had
been
based
on
kahn
versus
anderson.
and
--
and
they
have
held
in
this
particular
case
that
--
that
the
--
when
used
in
military
law,
the
terms,
“in
time
of
--
time
of
war"
and
"time
of
peace"
constitutes
actual
peace
or
war
and
not
technical
peace
or
war.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
follow
the
government's
contention,
what
is
going
to
be
the
result
as
far
as
all
of
these
decisions
which
have
--
had
been
handed
down
by
the
court
of
military
appeals?
if
we're
going
to
follow
the
government's
details
and
say
that
we
--
we
reject
--
we
reject
this
distinction,
these
cases
are
wrong.
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
every
case
is
wrong
if
you
follow
the
government's
contention
that
we
be
--
we
continue
to
be
at
war
from
pearl
harbor
up
until
the
japanese
peace
treaty
passed
in
1952.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
made
a
very
diligent
search
trying
to
find
another
case
wherein
the
army
had
tried
by
court-martial
any
person,
regardless
of
whether
they
were
discharged
or
not,
where
the
offense
of
murder
was
allegedly
committed
in
the
continental
united
states
between
the
date
of
july
the
25th,
1947
and
the
beginning
of
the
korean
conflict
and
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
whatsoever.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
i
--
offhand
i'm
not
able
to
cite
any
cases
but
--
but
i'm
sure
there
has
been
a
number
of
--
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
i
--
it
just
seems
to
me
that
i
can
remember
various
references
to
them,
although
i
didn't
see
any
in
the
book.
i
didn't
go
into
that
aspect
of
it
much.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
read
about
murders
having
been
committed
on
military
posts
wherein
the
men
have
been
tried
in
the
federal
courts
but
i
couldn't
cite
any
particular
case.
however,
in
that
--
in
that
connection,
here
is
a
--
it's
a
very
interesting
case
that
did
come
up
in
--
in
1950.
of
course,
at
that
time
we
did
not
have
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
we
didn't
have
it
until
after
may
1951.
but
in
this
particular
case,
this
case
arose
in
1950
--
in
1950
and
involved
--
it
actually
involved
a
question
of
whether
we
were
at
war
on
the
31st
of
july
1950.
and
the
case
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
--
what
we
call
the
judicial
council
which
was
then
the
judicial
council
which
sat
in
the
office
of
the
judge
advocate
general,
something
more
or
less
similar
to
the
board
of
reviews
which
we
now
have
all
over.
of
course,
as
i
say
we
didn't
have
the
court
of
military
of
appeals.
in
that
particular
case,
the
question
was
whether
we
were
at
war
or
not
because
we
have
the
--
we
have
the
offense
of
a
--
of
a
deserter.
and
the
court
said
the
background,
the
extent,
and
nature
of
the
hostilities
between
the
united
states
and
north
korean
forces
on
july
--
on
the
31st
of
july
1950
and
the
inevitable
results
of
such
hostility
is
up
to
that
time
in
terms
of
casualties,
again,
matters
of
common
knowledge
and
therefore
proper
subject
to
judicial
notice
are
genuine
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
state
of
public
war
between
the
two
governments
on
that
date.
and
this
involved
a
case
of
a
fellow
who
deserted
from
an
army
camp
up
in
--
up
in
fort
lewis,
washington
in
1950.
so
the
question
was
if
--
is
it
a
wartime
desertion
so
that
the
capital
punishment
so
that
he
can
be
--
be
disposed
of
and
court-martial
may
(inaudible)
to
being
killed
or
is
it
a
peace
time
desertion?
and
the
question
was
the
court
had
the
rule
and
the
judicial
council
as
early
as
the
31st
of
july
1950
which
was
of
course
only
about
two
months
after
the
korean
conflict
started
said
that
we
were
in
time
of
war.
well,
interesting
in
the
same
connection
was
a
case
which
came
up
in
--
in
may
the
8th,
1952
which
arose
when
a
soldier
was
sleeping
on
his
post
over
in
korea.
and
in
that
particular
case
the
court
said
--
they
said,
“and
the
interpretation
of
congress
itself
has
placed
on
the
hostilities
by
reestablishing
certain
wartime
rights
cause
us
to
believe
that
when
the
president
and
commander-in-chief
ordered
members
of
the
army
to
service
at
the
end
of
the
conflict,
he
involved
this
country
in
hostilities
to
wit
and
to
--
to
such
an
extent
that
the
state
of
war
existed
and
that
congress,
when
it
used
the
phrase
“in
time
of
war”
in
the
military
code,
intended
to
bring
--
to
apply
to
that
state
regardless
of
whether
it
was
initiated
or
continued
with
or
without
a
formal
declaration.
applying
the
rule
which
has
been
laid
down
in
the
reid
versus
covert
and
the
toth
decision,
i
ask
this
honorable
court,
what
is
the
reasonable
relationship
between
the
crime
of
john
lee,
a
dishonorably
discharged
ex-soldier,
for
the
ethical
offense
of
murder
which
allegedly
occurred
in
june
of
1949
by
court
--
by
a
general
court-martial,
instead
of
taking
him
over
roughly
150
miles
to
the
federal
district
court
for
the
southern
division
of
california
and
trying
him
by
a
federal
jury
where
his
constitutional
rights
among
others,
the
fair
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
would
be
respected?
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
he
would
be
--
he
would
be
tried
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
--
your
honor,
in
a
federal
court
because
--
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
--
it's
on
--
it's
on
a
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
carl
l.
rhoads
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
when
he
is
dishonorably
discharged
he
is
not
serving
--
his
contract
with
the
army
has
been
ended.
he's
not
receiving
pay,
he
can't
salute,
he
can't
re-enlist,
he
has
no
--
none
of
the
benefits
of
the
--
of
a
military
man.
we
--
he
doesn't
have
the
benefits
but
they
want
him
to
take
the
burdens.
they
say
that
he
--
he's
not
a
soldier,
he
can't
be
buried
in
arlington
cemetery,
he
can't
have
any
of
the
other
myriad
of
benefits
which
accrue
to
a
soldier.
but
by
the
same
token
they
say,
“but
we
still
have
jurisdiction
so
that
we
can
try
him
for
the
capital
offense
of
murder
when
allegedly
committed
in
the
continental
united
states
and
we
can
deny
him
his
fundamental
right
to
a
jury
trial.”
i
submit,
your
honor,
it's
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
hannon
will
now
discuss
the
constitutionality
of
article
2
(e).
thank
you,
gentlemen.
