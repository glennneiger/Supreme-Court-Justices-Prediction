justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
what's
the
consequence
that
they
have
been
or
maybe,
what
do
you
say
is
the
consequence
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it
wasn't
complicated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
are
wrong,
what
is
the
consequence
in
your
tax
situations
in
alaska?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
how
did
you
happen
to
take
that
in
and
not
take
in
the
rest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
group
--
particular
group
didn't
pay?
what
group?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
--
i'm
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
--
how
many
people
had
paid
the
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
individuals
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
how
did
the
--
the
others
who
were
not
paying
the
tax
over
these
years
escape
payments
during
this
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
an
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
that
suspended
the
payments
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
but
in
the
meantime,
the
majority
of
people
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
number,
who
have
paid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
then
the
--
it
was
offered
in
the
legislature
bill
in
just
a
year.
that
these
people
who
were
taxed
and
all
taxes
that
had
accrued
during
the
time
they
had
enjoined
it,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
in
1953,
there
was
a
bill
introduced
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have
forgiven
all
those
who
--
would
release
those
who
had
not
paid
their
taxes
from
payment
--
payment
of
the
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
provision
did
it
make
for
those
who
had
paid
their
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
way
the
bill
resulted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then,
what
you
say
is
that
they
declined
to
do
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
struck
out
the
clause
which
would
have
forgiven
the
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
repealed
a
law,
but
that
left
it
in
effect
by
the
savings
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
order
to
not
forgive
even
for
1953,
they
provided
that
certain
ones
could
collect
that
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
your
contention.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
rely
on
the
legislative
history.
you
rely
on
is
the
fact
that
this
tax
--
that
these
bills
were
offered
and
failed
to
pass
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
were
amended.
is
there
anything
else
that
connects
to
the
history
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
to
get
it
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
to
get
the
house
bill
in
evidence.
did
the
court
not
take
judicial
knowledge
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
refuse
to
consider
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one,
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
mean?
what
did
he
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
based
on
the
procedures?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said
there's
no
doubt.
what
question
of
procedure
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so
he
passed
that
over
and
went
to
the
merits
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
legislation
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
house
bill
number
3
get
in
here
if
it
was
not
--
if
it
didn't
take
judicial
notice
or
it
wasn't
introduced?
it
is
on
page
55.
it's
in
your
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
anybody
challenges
that.
i
don't
suppose
the
opposition
challenges
that
out
of
the
brief
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
it's
here
and
can
be
--
take
judicial
knowledge
of
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
bill
as
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
understand
you
to
say
you
are
a
big
territory?[laughs]
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
were
a
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
did
commit
an
error,
what's
the
injury?
i
--
i
had
not
supposed
that
anybody
would
claim
that
the
court
couldn't
take
judicial
knowledge
of
bills
offered
in
the
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
brief
of
your
adversary
does
go
on
the
basis
that
you
got
all
the
evidence
in
subjecting
to
cross-examination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
the
proof
of
effect,
it
was
a
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
believe
the
courts
have
--
had
to
do
with
the
bill,
the
bills
it
offered
in
the
legislature?
do
require
proof
of
fact
if
they
offered,
the
language
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what's
--
what's
the
practice
about
that?
i
--
maybe
as
an
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
an
equal
protection
argument
that
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
provides
a
uniformity
enacted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
have
it
in
this
writ,
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
judge
from
what
you
say
that
this
classification
would
be
on
the
basis
of
those
who
had
paid
and
those
--
in
favor
of
those
who
had
filed
a
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
have
to
reach
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
agree
with
the
interpretation
of
the
other
courts
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
agree
with
the
majority,
then
we'd
have
to
reach
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it's
raised
from
the
beginning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
it
been
raised
from
the
beginning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
petitioner
(inaudible)
on
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
--
if
the
act
gives
its
room,
would
you
say
that
was
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
is
--
does
that
that
statute
do
any
more
than
authorize
a
suit
by
the
state
under
the
circumstances
that
some
years
ago,
tennessee
was
allowed
to
file
a
suit
on
the
part
of
its
citizens
who
were
injured
by
smoke
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
if
--
suppose
that
people
have
been
required
to
pay
those
taxes
and
they
would
--
they
might
have
a
right
to
sue.
well,
if
you
have
the
thing
tested
out
some
way,
it
might
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
given
it
by
statute.
but
why
--
why
could
they
not
give
it
to
him
by
statute?
i'm
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
does
it
or
not
but
i'm
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
from
you
why
they
couldn't
use
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
the
statute
doesn't
cover
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute
could
get
us
something
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
decision
do
you
talk
about
in
puerto
rico?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
again
this
time
(b)
really
had
a
--
in
fact,
only
for
the
current
fact
here
whatever
that
might
be,
governed
by
(a)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
so
far
as
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
--
i
must
have
misunderstood
him.
i
thought
he
read
the
first
clause
to
those
that
have
been
even
before
that
in
1953,
and
the
second
clause
to
those
which
are
levied
in
1953.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
didn't
understand
him
to
read
it
as
applied
to
former
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
to
taxes
that
had
already
been
assessed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
year
1953.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
act
as
you
understand
it
if
there
had
been
nothing
but
section
1?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
could
have
collected
taxes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
had
been
assessed
prior
to
the
repeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
have
levied
taxes
for
any
that
had
not
been
assessed
prior
to
the
appeal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would've
been
bound
by
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
original
act
had
provided,
had
it
not,
section
3
of
the
regional
1949
act
or
a
different
in
the
treat
of
taxes
in
municipalities
and
school
of
public
utility
districts.
the
regional
act,
section
3
in
1949
created
a
different
system,
had
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
under
that
system
it
was
left
to
the
district
to
make
and
assess
that
any
time
they
saw
fit
and
get
through
it
at
any
time
they
saw
fit.
now,
if
--
if
the
act
--
if
it
only
been
section
1
repealing,
as
i
understand
it,
what
date
did
it
pass?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
march
12th.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
march
12th
then
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
over
insofar
as
in
the
assessment
of
perfection
of
taxes
was
concerned,
both
throughout
the
entire
territory
and
in
the
public
utility
district.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
necessary
if
they
desired
to
save
for
the
remainder
of
1953,
the
right
to
perfect
the
taxes
by
the
utility
district
that
they
do
what
they
did
in
section
2
--
of
section
2
(a),
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
to
do
that
if
they
want
to
save
that,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
yes,
all
right.
and
they
also
wanted
to
make
it
sure,
did
they
not,
that
as
part
as
that
--
that
that
didn't
foreclose
those
taxes
for
that
year.
they
were
treated
differently,
were
they
not,
in
both
bills?
and
the
reason
was
that
they
wanted
to
leave
it
up
to
the
utility
districts
and
so
forth.i
believe
the
claim
was
made
the
case
before
that
made
the
act
unconstitutional
because
it
didn't
apply
uniformly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
this
came
out
and
what
the
state
and
the
territory
insist
on
would
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
that
they're
taxes
for
the
entire
territory
including
the
utility
districts
would
be
enforced
and
applied
in
precisely
the
same
way
if
his
argument
is
correct.
but
if
your
argument
is
--
if
your
--
if
they
had
not
put
this
in,
it
would
have
been
a
matter
toward
forgiveness
of
any
taxes
where
they
have
assessment
had
not
been
completed
on
march
12th,
1953.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
with
section
--
that's
right,
could
have
been
non-levied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
they
had
to
--
if
they
wanted
to
let
the
utility
districts
get
that
part
of
the
tax
assuming
now
that
they
wanted
to
repeal
the
law
and
that
the
savings
clause
save
the
taxes
that
had
accrued
up
for
that
time.
it
would
only
have
--
that
would
only
have
been
included
in
their
taxes
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
had
not
included
this,
whatever
be
right
as
to
your
contention
in
here
as
to
the
prior
years.
they
had
not
included
this
and
if
one
undoubtedly
have
cut
off
all
these
districts
for
the
taxes
by
their
levies
had
not
been
completed
by
march
12th
of
1953.
would
it
not?
am
i
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
districts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
no
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
in
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
utility
districts
and
those
who
had
not
been
--
levy
their
taxes
under
the
varying
times
in
which
they
levy
their
taxes
would
have
been
barred
from
collecting
the
taxes
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
this
entire
territory
would
not
have
been
barred.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
territory
would
not
have
been
barred
if
they
had
repealed,
merely
repealed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
its
levy
had
already
been
made,
is
it
not?
in
1953?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
not
been
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
made,
july?
justice
hugo
l.
black
following
december.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
the
question
because
of
your
argument
that
the
general
rule
is
of
the
savings
clause,
especially
saving,
that
indicates
that
that's
all
it's
intended
to
be
saved.
but
if
there's
another
reason,
that
wouldn't
--
general
rule
wouldn't
apply,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
--
is
it
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
first
act
--
the
first
act
treated
those
two
types
of
taxation
differently.
the
second
act
comes
along
and
does
exactly
the
same
time.
it
takes
a
month
specially,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you,
mr.
arnold,
about
one
rule
of
construction
invoked
by
the
attorney
general?
you
haven't
discussed
it
and
maybe
you
think
it
has
no
merit
deserves.
he
takes
the
position
that
the
act
here
precluded
was
actually
construed
would
lead
to
an
unconscionable
result.
and
many
courts
have
said
that
if
one
construction
leads
to
an
unconscionable
result,
that
you
should
try
to
find
another
--
you
would
try
to
find
another.
did
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
the
rule
he
invokes
doesn't
apply
here
because
the
results
cannot
be
unconscionable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
argue
that
on
constitutional
provision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
i
--
i'd
like
to
know,
do
you
think
that's
a
question
of
evidence,
a
question
of
judicial
knowledge.
i
--
i
had
supposed
that
every
court
everywhere
could
take
judicial
knowledge
of
a
bill.
do
you
deny
that
this
the
proper
bill
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
some
more
to
which
you
wish
to
call
out
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
judicial
notice,
knowledge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
trying.
i'm
talking
about
considering
the
constitutionality
of
the
law.
and
we
constantly
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
--
of
the
bill
with
all
sources
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
everything
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
the
way
get
them
nearly
all
the
time,
one
of
the
litigants
supplies
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
way
they
come
to
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
can
agree
with
you
on
that.
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
evidence.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
judicial
knowledge.
but,
are
you
taking
a
position
that
we
cannot
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
bills
that
were
offered
in
this
connection.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
evidence
question.
that
to
me
is
--
i'm
just
speaking
for
myself
but
i
think
nothing
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
tie
the
constitutionality
of
act?
do
you
think
we've
got
to
go
get
evidence
offered
as
to
what
the
history
of
the
bill?
or
decide
--
to
decide
the
interpretation
of
it.
do
you
think
you'd
have
to
get
evidence
of
its
history
rather
than
just
take
judicial
knowledge
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
i
agree
to
that.
i
just
don't
understand
why
that
the
oldest
controversy
with
the
introduction
of
this
as
evidence,
going
on
the
theory
that
you
have
to
have
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
bill
that
take
place
as
you
pass
a
bill
to
the
legislative
body.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
what
i
--
what
i
said
was
i
couldn't
understand
why
so
much
arguments
should
be
made
or
whether
or
not
a
bill
to
the
part
of
legislative
record
was
offered.
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
it.
i
--
we
never
--
i
don't
recall
having
seen
anything
like
that
here
before.
maybe
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
--
to
me
it's
just
like
offering
to
prove
that
an
act
of
congress
as
a
piece
of
evidence
when
somebody
gives
it
a
--
signs
of
error,
the
fact
that
it
--
they
decline
to
admit
it
in
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
not
keep
records
of
the
bills
and
the
amendments?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
were
enacted
into
law,
was
it
not,
as
amended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
--
it
was
not
the
bills
that
--
if
so,
(inaudible)
legislated
by
the
year
the
numbers
of
bills,
if
they
had
numbered
these
bills
are
they
the
ones
that
finally
passed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
on
the
ground
if
we
don't
know
about
it
or
we
can't
consider
it.
sometimes
the
court
refuse
to
consider
it
as
having
anything
to
do
with
it
to
say,
we
won't
vote,
we
don't
need
to
go
through
it.
i
don't
recall
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
why
(inaudible)
--
turns
out
on
the
ground
that
we
could
judicially
notice
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
doesn't
touch
the
question
here.
what
you
are
reading
on
to
some
--
and
then
some
cases
it
said,
we
will
not
consider
the
legislative
history.
and
i
do
not
recall
maybe
--
maybe
it
has
been
done.
i
do
not
recall
this
court
has
ever
held
that
you
have
to
have
evidence
at
all
for
the
--
about
the
things
that
take
place
in
the
legislative
body
when
you
have
the
certificate
of
the
official
who
keeps
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
would
be
harmless
error
if
they
had
done
that?
if
it's
error
--
let's
suppose
it's
error,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
this
--
that's
so
important
in
connection
or
whether
this
is
a
good
record
and
whether
we
can
consider
it?
that
this
case
ought
to
be
reversed
on
that
ground
if
it
was
wrong,
not
to
let
it
come
in?
