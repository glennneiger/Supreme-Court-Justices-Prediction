mr.
w.
c.
arnold
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
as
the
attorney
general
pointed
out
this
property
tax
in
alaska
has
had
a
checkered
career.
its
validity
was
challenged
and
before
any
taxes
levied
under
the
act
became
due
and
payable.
and
that
--
the
--
the
question
of
its
validity
was
in
litigation
throughout
the
entire
course
of
the
act's
history
and
was
not
finally
determined
until
about
a
year
after
the
legislature
repealled
it.
throughout
the
several
sessions
of
the
legislatures
were
held
after
the
act
was
enacted,
various
efforts
were
made
to
repeal
it
or
to
modify
it
and
many
bills
were
introduced
for
that
purpose.
and
in
one
bill,
amended
form,
house
bill
number
3
eventually
became
a
law
on
march
12th,
1953.
now,
the
question,
the
constitutional
feature
of
this
matter
which
--
adverted
to
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
closing
part
of
his
argument,
and
i
--
i
should
like
to
present
my
views
upon
that
aspect
of
it.
as
attorney
general
says,
the
constitutional
matter
was
not
suggested
in
the
courts
below
either
on
the
argument
or
in
the
written
briefs
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
in
the
circuit
court.
and
it
is
my
view
or
our
view
that
it
was
injected
at
that
time
in
order
to
lay
a
foundation
for
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
later
filed.
the
trial
court
decided
the
case
upon
the
same
legal
theories,
the
same
authorities,
and
substantially
the
same
reason
as
was
followed
in
the
appellate
court.
and
the
territory
saw
no
constitutional
problem
there,
nor
any
--
nor
did
they
suggest
any
violation
over
the
last
--
this
organic
act.
here,
after
having
suggested
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
the
territory
devotes
a
considerable
amount
of
space
in
its
brief
and
upon
the
oral
argument
to
the
constitutional
question.
now,
we
don't
think
the
question
exists
nor
do
we
think
that
the
territory
has
the
power
to
raise
it
or
the
authority
to
raise
it
if
it
did
exist
either
here
or
in
the
courts
below.
and
i'm
not
basing
that
simply
upon
the
ground
that
they
failed
to
raise
it
below.
i
think
they
had
no
authority
to
raise
it
below
and
no
authority
to
raise
it
here.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
standing.
as
this
court
said
in
massachusetts
versus
mellon
and
florida
versus
mellon
and
in
other
--
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
no
one
--
no
one
can
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
except
upon
the
ground
that
he's
injured
by
its
invalidity.
and
the
state
is
no
different
from
a
private
person.
the
territory
is
no
better
than
state
and
then
i
--
i
submit
that
in
former
decisions
of
this
court
cited
in
our
brief,
make
it
clear
that
the
territory
is
not
being
injured
by
the
alleged
invalidity
or
the
alleged
discrimination,
the
alleged
unreasonable
classification.
not
being
of
the
group
injured
has
no
standing
to
raise
the
question
here.
and
if
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
do
not
think
that
the
laws
of
the
territory,
law
outlining
the
duties
of
the
attorney
general
of
alaska
changed
the
--
the
enunciated
principles
and
decisions
laid
down
in
former
cases
by
this
court
nor
do
i
think
that
they're
intended
to.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that
--
that
in
my
opinion,
mr.
justice,
that
statute,
that
territorial
statute
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
bring
a
suit
in
cases
where
a
suit
can
be
maintained
in
occasion
of
properties
where
a
suit
will
lie,
but
it
does
not
create
any
right
or
any
remedy
that
did
not
exist
before.
now,
in
the
tennessee
case,
this
court
held
that
where
the
--
the
broad
public
interest
was
involved,
such
as
in
questions
of
pollution
--
pollution,
diversion
of
water
and
that
type
of
things
which
affect
the
health
and
public
welfare
of
--
of
the
citizens
of
the
state,
that
the
state
can
sue
in
their
interest,
but
there's
no
parallel
here.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
if
the
people
who
are
injured
that
--
this
is
not
a
matter
of
general
public
concern,
the
people
who
paid
this
tax
and
who
might
claim
that
they
were
injured
by
the
application
of
the
--
this
repealing
law,
don't
desire
to
raise
a
question.
the
--
the
territory
or
the
attorney
general
has
no
--
no
authority
to
raise
it.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
think
the
territory
might
confer
upon
the
attorney
general
the
right
to
sue
or
bring
an
action
on
behalf
of
a
class.
that,
in
my
opinion,
they
have
not
done.
and
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
territory
statute
reaches
this
--
this
type
of
situation
at
all.
it's
--
it's
limited.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
don't
think
it
covers
at
all
and
i
don't
think
that
it
creates
any
substantive
rights
that
didn't
exist
before
with
reference
to
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
before
this
court.
now,
neither
do
we
think
there
--
the
act
is
unconstitutional.
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
territory
during
territorial
status.
that's
been
specifically
held
by
this
court
in
puerto
rico
and
other
cases.
and
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
it
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
it's
different.
at
the
time
that
the
puerto
rico
case
hit
--
arose,
that
puerto
rico
was
a
territory
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
as
alaska
is
now
a
territory.
the
status
of
puerto
rico
has
changed
and
the
status
of
alaska
is
about
to
change
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
but
the
parallel
of
the
--
the
case,
i
think,
is
decisive
on
the
point.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
puerto
rico
versus
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
i
believe
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
i
--
i
have
--
now,
as
i
say,
we
don't
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
under
territorial
status.
but
our
own
circuit
court
of
appeals
from
the
ninth
circuit
has
on
several
occasions
construed
the
alaska
organic
act,
which
contains
the
section
9
of
which
contains
the
equal
protection
clause
which
was
mentioned
here
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
argument.
they
construed
it
in
reference
to
this
taxing
act.
they
were
--
they
construed
it
in
reference
to
other
classifications
imposed
by
the
territorial
legislature
in
other
taxing
act.
and
on
the
basis
of
the
rule
on
madden
versus
kentucky,
it
held
that
the
section
9
of
the
alaska
organic
act
requires
no
greater
uniformity,
at
least
no
greater
uniformity,
than
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
if
it
were
applicable.
and
this
held
that
under
that
rule,
classifications
such
as
this
are
not
in
violation
of
the
organic
act.
now,
that
was
the
question
that
it
took
the
court
so
many
years
to
decide
in
this
alaska
property
tax
act.
whether
the
efforts
of
the
territorial
legislature
to
impose
this
tax
on
property
located
outside
the
municipalities
and
school
districts
alone,
and
leave
to
the
municipalities
and
school
districts
the
discretion
to
impose
it
within
their
limits
and
to
retain
the
money
for
their
own
purposes
if
they
didn't
decide
to
levy,
whether
that
type
of
a
classification
violated
the
organic
act.
the
circuit
court
who
largely
based
upon
madden
versus
kentucky
said
it
did
not.
this
court
refused
certiorari.
similar
situation
applied
with
reference
to
the
alaskan
net
income
tax.
so
that
it
is
our
view
that
that
question
is
settled
as
far
as
the
ninth
circuit
is
concerned.
it's
--
it's
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
the
organic
act
is
an
act
of
congress.
we
treat
it
as
a
territory's
constitution
but
it's
an
act
of
congress
like
any
other
act
and
it
has
a
settled
line
of
ninth
circuit
decisions
with
reference
to
its
classification,
to
the
classifications
that
are
permitted
under
which
we
believe
are
conclusive
here.
and
we've
cited
those
cases.
the
hess
versus
mullaney,
that's
the
litigation
involving
this
property
tax
act
and
other
cases
involving
the
alaska
net
income
tax
act,
so
that
we
think
they
are
conclusive.
now,
i
--
i
want
to
turn
to
what
i
think
is
the
--
the
point
of
controversy
in
this
case.
and
that's
the
legal
effect
of
this
repealing
act,
chapter
22,
the
session
laws
of
1953
repealing
the
alaska
property
tax
act.
now,
if
the
act
with
the
way
the
attorney
general
would
like
to
have
agreed,
and
i
--
i
think
that
there
might
be
some
point
to
his
argument.
but
the
act
doesn't
say
what
the
attorney
general
seeks
to
make
it
say.
section
2
of
the
repealing
act
was
saved
from
the
effect
of
the
repeal,
any
taxes
which
have
been
levied.
now,
the
attorney
general
wants
to
say
that,
that
means
any
tax
which
have
or
are
levied
during
the
current
fiscal
year,
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
said
any
taxes
that
have
been
levied.
and
it
can
only
be
read
to
mean
taxes
levied
during
into
life
of
the
act,
from
1949
until
the
date
of
repeal.
english
language
won't
--
won't
permit
any
other
interpretation
to
--
to
--
to
be
placed
upon
it.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
it
--
it
is
his
argument
but
it's
--
and
he
makes
it
very
nicely,
but
it's
not
a
good
distinction.
it's
--
it's
a
strain
upon
the
language
and
it
--
i
submit
that
it
cannot
be
read
in
that
fashion.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i'm
sorry.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
because
he
goes
on
that
--
the
--
the
section
2
goes
on
to
say
or
which
are
levied
and
assessed,
which
are
levied
and
assessed
during
the
current
fiscal
year.
now
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
they
--
they
have
different
dates
and
they
fix
their
own
dates
so
that
they
fix
them
and
change
them
from
time
to
time.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
recess
i
was
discussing
the
legal
implications
of
the
appeal
on
the
alaska
property
tax.
at
chapter
22,
the
session
laws
of
1953
commonly
known
as
the
repealing
act.
it
is
our
view
of
course
that
under
the
general
universal
rules
of
statutory
construction
that
the
repealing
act
having
saved
some
taxes
from
the
effect
of
repeal
is
to
be
construed
as
an
intention
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
save
those
taxes
and
none
other
upon
the
general
ground
that
a
specific
exemption,
exception
or
provision
is
controlling
over
a
general
provision
expressed
in
other
laws.
of
course
under
the
common
law
as
it
existed
even
back
to
foundation
of
our
own
constitution,
the
repeal
of
a
taxing
statute
abrogated
all
taxes
due
and
unpaid
at
that
time
of
the
repeal
unless
they
were
specifically
saved
or
unless
--
in
other
words,
the
repealing
act
contained
a
specific
provision
to
the
contrary.
this
is
the
universal
rule.
there's
no
authority
to
a
contrary.
none
is
cited
by
the
territory.
i
do
not
think
that
they
challenge
the
rule.
they
simply
seek
to
avoid
its
application.
now,
many
states
--
united
states,
territory
of
alaska,
all
have
general
laws
dealing
with
this
subject.
alaska
had
a
general
savings
act
which
is
quoted
in
the
briefs
of
counsel
which
saves
--
provides
at
a
no
obligation
founded
on
the
statute
or
obligation
incurred,
tax
or
license
to
be
due.
it
provides
--
cuts
the
fees
and
licenses
due
may
be
enforced
after
repeal
unless
the
repealing
act
provides
to
the
contrary.
and
of
course
it's
our
position
and
supported
i
think
amply
that
this
repealing
act
did
provide
to
the
contrary.
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
legislature
to
save
all
taxes
due
under
the
act
nor
was
it
their
intention
to
abrogate
all
the
taxes
due
under
the
act.
they
enacted
a
special
section,
section
2
of
the
act,
specifically
delineating
the
taxes
they
desired
to
save.
that
provision
is
contrary
or
in
conflict
with
the
general
savings
act
of
alaska.
and
being
specific,
later
in
point
at
time,
it
must
be
held
to
control.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
because
the
exemption
--
the
--
in
setting
provisions
of
the
alaska
property
tax
act,
it
contained
a
provision
authorizing
the
territorial
tax
commissioner
and
other
officials
of
the
territory
to
grant
incentive
exemptions
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
incentive
exemptions
for
other
creation
of
new
industries,
a
territory
at
it
came
out
of
efforts
to
induce
the
development
of
alaska's
pulp
and
other
--
other
resources.
there
was
a
provision
in
the
law
authorizing
the
issuance
of
exemption
certificates,
as
an
incentive
to
induce
capital
and
those
certificates.
and
those
exemption
ran
not
only
to
the
territorial
taxes
but
to
the
municipal
taxes
and
the
public
utility
district
taxes
so
that
they
--
the
effort
here
by
(b)
was
to
provide
that
the
exemption
certificates
in
existence
should
continue
in
existence
throughout
the
current
year
when
the
municipalities
and
public
utility
districts
were
levying
taxes
under
this
section
2
(a).
it
was
to
complete,
it
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
successful
one
to
leave
that
phase
of
the
matter
just
as
it
was
before.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
it
--
it
so
reads,
mr.
justice.
an
exemption
from
taxes
referred
to
in
section
a
above,
it
refers
only
to
the
exemptions
to
those
taxes,
(a)
above
are
the
taxes
which
have
been
levied
and
assessed
by
any
municipality
or
which
are
levied
and
assessed
during
the
current
fiscal
year.
now
of
course
the
exemption
had
been
in
effect
in
prior
years,
they
left
it
in
effect
just
to
priors
years
and
continued
it
in
effect
as
to
the
current
year.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
the
taxes
were
not
forgiven
for
prior
years
in
--
in
municipalities
and
school
districts,
in
public
utility
districts.
they
were
expect
--
expressly
saved
from
the
effect
of
the
repeal.
none
of
them
were
forgiven.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
that
is
in
my
opinion
is
the
effect.
it
saved
those
taxes
in
municipalities,
school
districts,
and
it
continued
the
incentive
exemption
after
those
taxes.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
taxes
which
have
been
levied
in
my
--
in
my
view
apply
to
taxes
levied
in
municipalities,
school
districts
and
so
forth
during
the
year
1949
or
1950,
1951
and
1952.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
but
mr.
justice
whittaker,
he
sustains
that
argument
by
changing
the
tax
to
the
act
and
i
--
i
quote
him,
i
think,
correctly.
and
his
argument
here
a
few
minutes
ago.
and
i'm
referring
now,
to
section
2
(a)
which
is
on
page
5
of
the
brief.
he
says,
“now
let's
read
this,
to
mean
any
taxes
which
are
levied
(inaudible).”
well
it
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
that's
the
way
i
read
it
mr.
justice
black.
i
read
that
have
been
as
to
apply
to
former
years.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i
--
he
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
you
mean
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i
think
that's
his
argument.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--i
--
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
was
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
desperately
want
and
understood
it
is
not
mine
because
i
don't
agree
with
it.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
the
attorney
general's
argument
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
thoroughly
disagree
with
it.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes.
and
if
--
i
think
that
that's
a
strain
upon
the
--
upon
the
wording
the
act
that
it
will
not
bear
it
as
true,
that
municipalities
and
school
districts
have
varying
assessment
periods
and
varying
periods
when
the
taxes
are
--
their
taxes
are
due
and
payable.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
i
questioned
very,
very
much
whether
any
of
those
periods
occur
before
march
12th
in
the
year.
i
call
your
attention
to
that
--
that
the
journal
entries
that
are
set
forth
in
this
record
and
briefs
of
the
parties
show
that
this
--
this
legislation
was
--
was
introduced
in
the
early
part
of
january.
that
these
amendments
which
were
--
were
adopted
in
february
so
that
the
period
that
the
attorney
general
speaks
about
is
40
or
45
days,
50
days
in
january
and
in
the
early
part
of
february.
i
--
i
--
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
legislature
could
have
had
that
brief
period
in
mind.
as
--
as
your
honors
know,
tax
is
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
think
that
those
were
alleged
prior
to
march
15th
throughout
the
life
of
a
law,
was
what
they
were
attempting
to
say.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
now
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
mr.
justice
clark,
the
tax
is
levied
in
1952,
in
january
of
1952
by
the
act,
or
that
became
due
in
january
--
that
were
levied
in
1952
were
only
coming
due
at
this
date
if
1952
taxes
were
not
due
until
february
1st.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
not
under
the
--
or
one
of
the
general
savings
clause
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
if
--
if
you
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
if
you
--
under
the
attorney
general's
construction
of
--
of
the
repealing
act
that
would
be
true.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
these
statutes
can
be
read
in
that
session.
i
--
i
believe
that
what
--
they
say
the
tax
that
have
been
levied
they
--
it's
a
strain
but
the
language
won't
stand
to
read
into
it
have
been
levied
during
this
calendar
year.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no,
no
i
wasn't.
sorry.
i
--
i
think
that
generally
--
generally
speaking
july
1st
is
the
--
is
the
date
that
most
of
the
municipalities
and
school
districts
use.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
because
mr.
chief
justice,
had
they
done
so,
they
would
have
deprived
the
municipalities
and
the
public
utility
districts
of
a
good
measure
of
their
revenue
both
current
and
past.
the
municipalities
would
not
have
been
able
to
enforce
the
collection
of
any
taxes
levied
during
the
life
of
this
act
that
were
not
paid
on
the
date
of
the
repeal
as
they've
gone
ahead
with
that
wording.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
nor
would
they
have
been
able
to
levy
or
collect
them
for
the
current
year,
which
the
legislature
desired
them
to
do.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
they
can
done
a
better
job
in
drawing
this
act
and
title,
i
--
i
agree
with
that,
and
if
they
had
adopted
the
wording,
the
title
that
you
used,
abrogating
and
repealing
all
taxes
except
those
specifically
saying
by
section
2
(a)
why
--
this
controversy
would
not
have
arisen.
but
they
didn't
do
that.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
there's
no
question
but
if
there
was
a
change
of
mind.
that
they
were
bill,
the
authors
of
the
bill
proposed
to
abrogate
all
unpaid
taxes
and
--
and
they
so
state
it.
the
legislature
didn't
want
to
do
that.
they
wanted
to
save
from
that
repeal,
from
the
effect
of
the
repeal,
the
taxes
in
the
municipalities
and
public
utilities
and
they
changed
the
bill
accordingly.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
the
law
does
that.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
not
of
course
it's
what
caused
the
controversy.
this
bill
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
this
bill,
like
all
bills
in
the
legislature
introduced
in
committee
and
was
considering,
it
was
amended
several
times.
some
of
the
proposals,
the
title
changes
only
are
--
are
carried
in
the
legislative
journals.
the
tax
to
the
bills
and
the
amendments
and
the
debate
are
not
made
a
matter
of
record.
but
it's
the
bill
as
finally
enacted
which
is
--
which
we
treat
we
are
here
today
as
this
court
said
and
as
the
circuit
court
said.
this
court
in
trailmobile
company
versus
whirls,
interpretation
of
statutes
cannot
safely
be
made
the
rest
upon
mute,
intermediate,
legislative
maneuvers.
now,
i
can't
say
--
i
don't
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
the
--
the
forces,
the
changes
of
view
and
the
conflicts
of
opinion
which
went
into
the
enactment
of
this
law
in
its
final
form.
but
it
is
clear,
from
this
record
and
from
an
inspection
of
the
legislative
journals,
that
the
bill
as
originally
introduced
did
not
suit
the
majority
of
will
of
the
legislature.
they
did
not
want
to
abrogate
for
all
taxes.
they
wanted
to
save
some
taxes.
they
changed
the
bill
accordingly
and
they
changed
the
title
accordingly.
and
--
and
we're
here
now
in
an
effort
to
construe
the
effect
of
that
repeal.
and
since
under
the
rules
of
statutory
construction
as
we
understand
them
and
as
the
trial
on
appellate
court
understands
them,
having
saved
some
taxes
it
must
be
intended,
that
they
intended
to
save
no
others.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
if
it
only
been
section
1
then
the
--
the
general
alaska
savings
statute
would
come
into
full
play.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
all
of
the
taxes.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no.
they
could
not
have
taken
any
step
under
the
act
to
perfect
a
tax
claim
after
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
right.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
oh,
the
regional
taxing
act,
yes.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes,
it
provided
a
different
system.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
march
the
12th.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
it
became
effective
march
the
12th.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
the
repealing
act.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
they
are
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
they
had
to
do
in
the
latter
part
of
it,
all
which
are
levied
and
assessed
during
the
current
fiscal
year
of
such
municipalities.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
without
section
2
there
could
have
been
no
taxes
levied
after
march
12th.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
correct.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
mr.
justice
black,
in
my
view,
had
they
wanted
to
do
that
and
that
only,
then
the
first
part
of
section
2
would
not
have
been
included
because
it
would
have
been
surpluses.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
because
they
--
if
they
expected
the
taxes
that
are
already
levied
and
assessed
to
be
saved
under
the
general
repeal
statute,
there
would
be
no
use
for
them
to
repeat
themselves
over
again
and
say,
again,
that
any
taxes
which
have
been
levied
and
assessed.
because
under
the
construction
that
the
counsel
contend
for
and
under
the
--
your
honor's
statements
as
i
understand
it,
they're
duplicating,
they
would
be
duplicating
the
general
repealing
statute
in
that
respect.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
it
would
have
cut
off
if
they
--
if
they
had
not
--
if
they
had
not
included
it
then
the
taxes
that
were
already
levied
on
march
12th,
1953
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
by
the
districts,
would
have
been
saved
under
the
general
repealing
act.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
all
to
territorial
taxes
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no,
no
future
taxes.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
they'd
been
barred
from
making
future
levies
under
this
act.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
the
territory
had
no
--
no
tax
on
--
on
the
act
that
was
repealed.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
they
would
have
been
--
the
territory
would
have
been
barred
from
making
any
additional
levies,
yes.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
right.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no,
no.
it's
not
been
made.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no,
it's
not.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
it
would
have
been
--
it
would
have
been
made
the
following
december.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
the
taxes
levied
in
these
special
districts
are
not
the
subject
of
this
suit
and
the
territory
doesn't
claim
any
of
those
either.
this
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
this
suit
is
for
taxes
outside
of
the
district.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
territory
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
claims
any
rights
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
beyond
march
1953.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
my
difficulty
there
mr.
justice
is
that
the
other
reason
is
derived
only
by
changing
the
wording
of
the
act.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that
in
my
view.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
it
allowed
one
to
remain
for
the
current
year
and
the
other
one,
it
didn't.
and
i
--
i
submit
that
in
my
view
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
collection
of
taxes
accrued
prior
to
march
12th
either
outside
in
municipalities
or
in
municipalities
except
as
they're
saved
by
section
2.
and
they
saved
them
within
municipalities
having
expressed
their
desire
to
save
them
there,
under
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
it
follows
that
they
did
not
desire
to
save
them
anywhere
else.
that's
my
view.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
i
know
of
no
way
to
present
this
phase
in
the
matter
any
clearer
and
to
me,
any
more
precise
way,
that
it
was
treated
by
majority
opinion
in
the
--
in
the
appellate
court.
i
--
they
have
cited
the
general
rules
of
statutory
construction,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
rule
established
in
the
portal-to-portal
cases.
the
rule
on
repealing
act
and
prohibition
act,
one
came
from
the
second
circuit
and
the
other
the
fourth,
a
long
line
of
authorities
in
this
court
supporting
this
type
of
construction.
only
recently,
this
court
through
mr.
justice
whittaker
said,
“however,
inclusive
may
be
the
general
language
of
a
statute,
it
will
not
be
held
to
apply
to
a
matter
specifically
dealt
with
in
another
part
of
the
same
enactment.
specific
terms
prevail
over
the
general
and
the
same
or
another
statute,
which
otherwise
might
be
controlling.”
so
they
made
a
specific
reservation
here.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i'd
be
on
pretty
weak
ground,
i
think.
if
it
read
as
i
understand
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
if
i
understand,
your
--
your
honor
to
mean
that
the
act
would
read,
“any
taxes
which
are
levied
and
assessed
during
the
current
fiscal
year
by
municipalities,
school
and
public
utilities
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
i
think
that
then
the
general
savings
act
would
apply.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
but
mr.
justice,
as
you
--
as
you
and
i
have
amended
the
act,
it
has
purely
prospective
application.
it
applies
only
to
those
things
that
happened
after
march
12th.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
as
retrospective,
yes.
they
--
it
is.
in
my
view
it
is
retrospective.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
and
in
my
view
it
can't
be
read
any
other
way
and
that's
the
way
this
trial
court
and
the
circuit
court
read
it.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
save
those
taxes
and
none
--
none
other.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
now,
if
you
read
it
prospectively,
that's
something
different
again
because
the
general
savings
statute
has
no
prospective
feature.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
it's
the
question
upon
which
this
case
was
decided
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
trial
court,
and
the
appellate
court,
the
very
question.
i
--
i
think
there
was
no
other.
i
think
all
these
other
things
are
--
are
extraneous,
constitutional
provision
that
the
--
the
powers
that
heard
by
the
territory
on
my
friend,
the
attorney
general.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
they
have
much
to
do
with
this.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
have
to
defer
to
mr.
justice
brennan
on
that.[laughter]
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
mr.
justice,
if
the
punctuation
that
you
speak
of
changes
the
meaning
of
the
act,
i
--
i
think
it
--
it's
quite
immaterial.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i
--
i
read
it
the
other
way
myself
and
i
--
i
may
be
wrong,
but
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
court
agrees
with
me.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
so
i
--
i'm
not
completely
alone.
i
--
i
don't
see
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
i'm
not
able
to
read
it
in
any
other
fashion
nor
to
read
the
background
of
it.
there
was
a
controversy
about
what
taxes
should
be
abrogated
and
what
taxes
should
be
saved.
one
bill
abrogated
them
all.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
(voice
overlap)
amended
in
the
fashion
so
as
to
save
them
all.
that
was
the
first
amendment,
struck
out
section
2.
then
they
were
all
saved.
that
didn't
suit.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
don't
think
i
make
it
my
--
my
argument,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
think
it's
there.
it's
there
in
the
act.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes.
and
i
think
that
the
efforts
of
the
territory
are
to
read
it
out
of
--
out
of
the
act.
mine
is
to
--
is
to
leave
it
and
to
have
it
--
read
what
it
says.
i
think
it
says
what
it
means
and
it
means
what
it
says.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
don't
quite
agree
with
that.
here
is
what
i
think
it
said,
what
section
1
says.
it
says
that
all
--
that
the
act
is
hereby
repealed
but
that
this
repeal
shall
not
have
the
effect
of
abrogating
or
curtailing
any
taxes
previously
levered
under
the
act.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
what
it
says
because
by
--
by
operation
of
the
--
of
the
alaska
code
and
--
and
by
the
settled
constructions
in
such
cases,
over
constructions
of
such
cases.
the
alaska
general
savings
statute
is
to
be
read
as
though
it
were
a
part
of
this
repeal.
it's
to
be
read
as
a
part
of
and
that's
what
it
says.
it
says
that
this
repeal
shall
not
abrogate
any
taxes
due
on
the
repeal
date.
but
the
legislature
didn't
want
it
that
way.
so
they
said
that
some
taxes
should
be
saved
but
not
all.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
is
that
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
this
court
followed
it.
the
attorney
general's
conclusion
in
that
--
in
that
respect
it
would
overrule
dozens
of
decisions
of
this
court
and
thousands
of
decisions
of
state
courts
and
--
and
under
the
common
--
english
common
law.
that
is
the
rule
that
when
a
taxing
act
is
repealed,
no
--
a
liability
exists
to
pay
the
taxes
that
have
not
been
collected
as
of
the
date
of
the
repeal.
now,
this
is
the
unconscionable
result
which
the
attorney
general
talks
about
because
the
repeal
cuts
off
the
unpaid
taxes
and
does
not
refund
the
taxes
of
those
who
paid
prior
to
the
repeal.
it
has
been
--
as
a
law
of
this
country
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
came
here
from
england.
i
--
i
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
if
it
--
if
it's
unconscionable
then
in
the
thousands
of
cases
that
had
been
decided
in
this
country
and
many
by
this
court,
that
feature
has
been
overlooked.
now,
taxes
are
not
a
contractual
obligation.
they're
purely
involuntary.
nobody
has
any
duty
to
pay
taxes
except
if
that
duty
is
imposed
upon
him
by
law.
and
when
that
law
is
repealed,
the
duty
to
pay
the
taxes
disappears.
and
there's
nothing
unconscionable
about
that
or
it's
never
been
so
considered
in
our
system
of
government,
and
that's
what
occurred
here.
now,
while
this
is
not
in
the
records,
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief
says
that
8000
people
paid
taxes
under
this
--
or
11,000
people
paid
taxes
under
this
act,
8000
people
didn't.
now
--
as
of
the
date
of
the
repeal.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
but
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
would
say
so
if
it
weren't
correct.
i
don't
have
any
--
any
way
of
testing
it
but
i
assume
that
it
is
correct.
so
that
some
people
elected
to
pay
the
--
some
people
elected
to
pay
these
taxes
while
the
tax
commissioner
was
in
--
under
injunction
from
collecting
them
or
enforcing
their
collection
upon
the
ground
of
the
problem,
in
the
validity
of
the
act.
others
elected
to
pay
due
out
to
other
stages
of
this
litigation
which
existed
in
the
entire
life
of
the
act.
at
some
stages,
the
territory
refused
to
receive
taxes
that
were
proferred
under
act
because
they
said
the
matter
was
in
litigation,
they
didn't
want
them.
now,
then
the
legislature
repealed
the
law.
8000
people
have
paid
400
--
i
guess,
i
get
it
twisted
--
11,000
people
had
paid
$400,000.8000
people
owed
a
$1,200,000.
now,
the
--
the
attorney
general's
argument
is
it
would
be
unconscionable
for
the
legislature
to
pass
such
a
law,
and
if
they
did
pass
such
a
law
it
would
be
the
duty
of
this
court
to
strike
it
down.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that's
correct.
and
there
is
no
support
for
that
argument
in
my
--
in
my
judgment,
none
at
all.
now,
in
this
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that
they
can
do
it?
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes.
we've
cited
with
the
footnotes
in
the
briefs,
a
hundred
or
more
in
the
briefs
here
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
including
some
themes
of
this
court
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes,
many
of
them.
many
of
them
are
in
the
--
in
the
portal-to-portal
act,
the
same
type
of
question
arose.
the
same
attack
was
made
that
this
cutoff
claims,
some
of
which
had
been
paid
and
some
of
which
hadn't,
that
the
--
that
had
reached
this
court,
certiorari
was
denied.
the
constitutionality
was
attacked
and
the
act
was
declared
valid
by
the
circuits.
same
result
was
reached
in
a
--
in
many
state
cases
which
we
have
cited,
on
the
reference
to
on
our
brief,
very
exhaustive
notes
in
the
matter.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes,
mr.
justice,
and
they're
cited
in
our
brief
but
i
would
call
your
attention.
in
fact,
that
the
decision
holding
this
act
to
be
valid,
property
tax
to
be
invalid
was
handed
down
a
year
after
the
legislature
repealed
the
law.
a
year
after
the
legislature
repealed
the
law.
and
a
part
--
and
a
very
large
part
--
as
you
and
i
can
see
of
this
$400,000
that
you
paid
was
paid
after
the
repeal
by
people
who
--
who
for
one
reason
or
another,
voluntarily
or
otherwise,
continued
to
make
the
payments.
now,
we
thought
the
tax
is
no
longer
in
existence.
we
advised
our
clients
not
to
pay
them.
others
took
a
different
position.
for
over
a
year
or
more,
a
year-and-a-half,
court
was
enjoin
--
the
court
has
enjoined
the
collection
of
these
taxes,
some
people
continued
to
pay
them
during
that
period.
that
was
their
right.
but
we
don't
think
it
prejudice,
the
position
of
those
who
--
who
elected
not
to
pay
them
until
uplifting
was
finally
determined.
i
haven't
said
anything
about
this
house
bill
3
and
5.
the
territory
specified
the
refuser
--
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
receive
these
documents
in
evidence
during
an
oral
argument
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
prejudicial
error.
this
case
was
never
tried.
it
never
opened
for
the
reception
of
evidence.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted
upon
the
ground
of
no
personal
action
would
lie
to
collect
these
taxes
and
upon
the
further
ground
that
the
tax
did
not
survive
the
repeal.
during
the
course
of
that
argument
the
territory
attempted
to
introduce
these
documents
as
evidence
and
they
were
rejected.
that
rejection
was
specified
as
error
to
the
--
to
the
circuit
court.
the
circuit
court
held
that
it
was
not
error
and
by
inference,
with
which
i
agree,
they
said
that
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
any
event.
and
that
they
would
assume
that
the
title
of
the
bill
is
shown
in
the
journals,
showed
their
purpose.
and
after
denying
it
was
error
they
said
that
--
they
went
ahead
to
consider
the
bills
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion.
i'm
not
able
to
tell
from
this
record
whether
the
territory
seeks
to
have
this
court
reverse
upon
the
ground
of
error
or
to
receive
evidence
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
in
this
argument
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
too
much
difference.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
agree
with
the
circuit
court
that
the
journals
are
--
can
be
judicially
noticed.
they
show
the
titles
to
these
bills.
they
show
the
amendments,
the
text
to
the
amendments,
as
they
were
offered.
i
agree
with
the
circuit
court
that
when
you
consider
those
things
that
are
in
those
journals,
you
consider
everything
the
same
as
though
you
have
the
bills
before
you.
there
isn't
enough
difference
to
--
to
influence
the
ultimate
decision
of
this
case.
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
--
i
think
it's
inappropriate
for
--
for
this
court
to
--
to
receive
evidence
at
this
posture
of
the
case.
if
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
rejecting
this
evidence,
well
then,
the
case
should
be
reversed
upon
that
ground.
i
don't
think,
however,
the
matter
by
a
material.
i
--
i
think
again
about
the
same
answer.
now,
i
called
attention
of
course
the
fact
that
these
are
personal
actions.
the
trial
court
held
that
no
personal
action
would
lie
to
collect
the
tax
such
as
this
that
was
leaning
on
the
property,
was
a
special
provision
for
collection
provided
in
the
act
that
the
remedy
was
exclusive
and
that
no
personal
liability
existed.
the
circuit
court
didn't
reach
that
question
because
it
found
that
the
tax
didn't
survive.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
feel
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
consider
evidence
not
available
to
the
trial
court.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no,
i
don't
deny
this
as
a
proper
bill,
mr.
justice
black
but
if
--
if
these
are
to
be
noticed
because
they're
presented,
there
are
dozens
of
other
bills
repealing
this
act,
dozens
of
other
versions.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
if
this
matter
now
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
if
this
matter
is
to
be
tried
on
that
issue
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
think
you
take
judicial
knowledge
of
--
of
the
records
of
the
congress
and
of
the
agencies,
but
these
are
not
of
those
records.
these
are
supplied
by
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i'm
not
trying
to
deny
the
rule
of
--
of
judicial
notice.
i
merely
say
that
the
--
and
i
--
and
it
--
this
--
the
trial
court
did
not
commit
error
when
it
refused
to
accept
evidence
offered
in
the
court
for
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
oral
argument.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes,
it
is
my
position
that
these
records
are
not
of
the
kind
nature
of
which
judicial
knowledge
can
be
taken,
that
proof
must
be
supplied
and
a
proof
must
be
supplied
while
the
question
of
this
appropriateness
under
the
rules
of
evidence
arises.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
you
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of
--
of
the
recorded
history
of
the
act,
yes.
i
don't
agree,
mr.
justice
that
--
that
judicial
knowledge
and
evidence
are
the
same
thing.
judicial
knowledge
dispenses
with
evidence.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i
can
explain
how
the
controversy
arises.
the
bills
were
offered
in
the
course
of
an
oral
argument
in
the
trial
court.
the
court
said
that
he
could
--
would
not
receive
evidence,
he
would
not
accept
them
as
evidence
but
they
would
judicially
notice
the
legislative
journals
and
published
records.
the
territory
specified
that
as
error
and
sought
to
reverse
the
trial
court
upon
that
ground
in
the
appellate
court
and
they
seek
the
same
result
here.
this
is
an
effort
on
their
part
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
to
send
this
case
back
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i
don't
think
that
you
properly
entertained
the
argument
on
a
case
or
an
offer
was
--
an
effort
was
made
to
introduce
evidence
during
an
oral
argument.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
that's
--
that
is
one
--
you
--
that
is
a
record
of
the
congress
that
you
can
judicially
notice.
the
territorial
legislature
doesn't
keep
that
kind
of
a
record,
if
its
actions.
it
only
keeps
a
record
of
the
bills
that
it
finally
enacts.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no,
definitely
not.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
this
matter
was
before
two
or
three
sessions
of
the
legislature.
there
must
have
been
12
or
15
bills
introduced
at
--
at
various
times.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
yes,
and
in
this
session
and
other
amendments
offered,
and
committee
hearings,
and
debates.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
now
this
--
this
is
--
this
is
just
a
little
segment
of
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
if
you're
to
go
outside
of
the
published
record,
why
then
i
don't
know
how
far
you
go
but
then
is
just
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
a
little
segment
of
it.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
is
an
official
record
of
the
--
of
the
territorial
legislature.
and
i
hasten
to
say
that
i
don't
doubt
the
veracity
of
the
attorney
general
either.
i
don't
know
where
he
got
it.
i
wouldn't
know
where
to
get
it.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i'm
sure
that
it's
not
a
part
of
the
records
of
the
territorial
legislature.
i
--
i'm
sure
of
that.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
the
bills
that
are
enacted
in
the
law
and
they
keep
record
of
amendments
offered
on
--
on
the
floor
of
the
house
in
a
published
journal.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
no.
oh,
as
amended,
yes,
but
these
bills
were
not
enacted
into
law.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
house
bill
3
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
--
with
amendments
was
enacted
into
law
but
not
--
but
this
version
here
is
not
--
was
not
enacted
into
law.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well
mr.
justice,
i
have
never
indicated
at
all
and
i
thought
it
was
a
forgery
or
--
or
spurious
in
any
fashion.
but
now,
i
don't
--
if
i
seek
to
get
the
secretary
of
alaska
to
give
me
a
copy
of
some
document
in
his
office
and
affix
his
seal,
do
i
understand
then
that
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
that
document?
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well
i
--
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
never
heard
or
i
know
of
no
recorded
case
where
--
where
the
rule
of
judicial
knowledge
is
--
has
--
has
extended
that
far.
this
court
frequently
refuses
to
recognize
or
--
or
consider
debates
from
the
congressional
record.
they
are
official
documents,
too.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
in
this
type
of
--
of
matter,
mr.
justice
black.
that
--
and
this
is
just
--
i
read
this
a
while
ago,
just
a
sense,
but
there
are
several
other
decisions.
interpretation
of
statutes
cannot
safely
be
made
to
rest
upon
mute,
intermediate
legislative
maneuvers.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
in
other
words
that
these
questions
are
--
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
well,
i
--
i
wanted
--
my
time
is
up
and
i
close
only
this
way.
but
i
--
i
certainly
would
not
like
to
be
understood
as
agreeing
and
i
think
this
court
ought
to
accept
and
receive,
and
consider
documents
here
which
the
lower
court
rejected.
now,
let's
say
the
lower
courts
erroneously
rejected
them,
then
the
case
should
be
reversed
upon
that
ground
in
my
view.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
that
question
should
be
addressed
to
the
attorney
general
because
he
comes
here
asking
that
very
thing.
he
asks
you
to
reverse
these
courts
upon
the
ground
of
error
committed
below
in
that
respect,
we
don't
ask
it.
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
we
think
that
if
you
consider
the
bills,
consider
the
titles,
you
considered
everything.
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
at
all.
the
circuit
court
in
their
decisions
that
they
wouldn't
--
they
would
consider
the
bills
because
they
were
the
same
as
the
titles.
mr.
w.
c.
arnold
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
our
position
and
that
was
the
position
of
the
trial
court
below.
i
--
it's
my
understanding
that
the
--
the
attorney
general
argued
below
--
he
did
argue
below
and
it's
my
understanding
that
he
maintains
the
position
yet
that
there
is
a
personal
liability.
