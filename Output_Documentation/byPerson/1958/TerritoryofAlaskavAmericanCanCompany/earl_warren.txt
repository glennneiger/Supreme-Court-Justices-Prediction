earl
warren
yes,
i
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
as
i
understand
it,
as
a
matter
of
--
of
legislative
intent
to
cite
that
the
--
that
the
original
bill
did
provide
for
wiping
out
all
accrued
and
unpaid
taxes
under
this
chapter
10,
but
that
the
senate
later
changed
it
in
order
to
avoid
that
result.

what

it
was
--
the
action
was
by
the
respondents
--
chief

earl
warren
--
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
had
been
no
challenge
to
--
to
its
being
proper
in
the
--
in
the
record,
is
there
--
has
there
or
has
there?
the
propriety
that
being
in
there
has
not
been
challenged,
has
it?
chief

earl
warren
all
right.(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
wondering
why
it
isn't
in
the
journal.
is
--
isn't
that
something
normal,
it
would
be
in
the
journal.
chief

earl
warren
and
he
said
those
that
are
in
the
journal
could
be,
and
this
is
not
in
the
journal

chief
justice
earl
warren
we
don't
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
raised.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
did
--
did
the
court
pass
on
it
all,
comment
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
attorney
general.
mr.
arnold,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you,
if
they
--
mr.
arnold,
if
they
have
the
school
districts,
if
they
have
different
fiscal
years
and
different
tax
dates.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arnold,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arnold,
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me
and
this
is
that
--
on
your
chapter
22,
session
laws
of
alaska
1953,
the
original
bill
was
entitled,
"an
act
to
repeal
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska
1949
as
amended
by
chapter
88,
session
laws
of
alaska
1949
and
abrogating
and
repealing
all
accrued
and
unpaid
taxes
levied
thereunder
and
declaring
an
emergency."
then
there
were
several
changes
made
as
it
went
through
and
the
title
ended
up
this
way.
an
act
to
repeal
the
alaska
property
tax
act
enacted
by
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska
1949
as
amended
by
chapter
88,
session
laws
of
alaska
excepting
from
repeal
certain
taxes
and
tax
exemptions,
and
declaring
an
emergency.
now,
if
--
if
they
intended
to
enact
this
law,
according
to
your
construction,
why
wouldn't
they
leave
in
there
and
abrogating
and
repealing
all
accrued
and
unpaid
taxes
levied
thereunder
except?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
why
would
they
not
under
specific
language,
which
abrogated
and
repealed
all
accrued
and
unpaid
tax
levies
except
those
that
you
had
just
mentioned?
why
wouldn't
--
why
wouldn't
that
be
just
as
a
--
reasonable
to
do
as
to
put
the
construction
that
you
put
upon
this
act
after
the
title
has
been
changed
because
you
get
the
same
result
that
without
it
being
in
the
--
in
the
title?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
they
didn't
but
it
show
some
significance
to
me
when
they
started
that
way.
and
in
the
original
bill
they
spoke
of
abrogating
and
repealing
all
accrued
and
unpaid
tax
levies
and
then
backed
away
from
it
and
use
something
else.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
--
that
would
indicate
they
--
a
change
of
mind
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
as
to
what
they
had
intended
to
do
when
they
--
when
they
filed
the
original
bill.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
--
my
point
is
that
as
--
as
the
bill
was
finally
enacted
they
don't
specifically
say
either
in
the
title
or
in
the
body
of
the
act
that
they
abrogate
or
forgive
any
taxes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
--
that
seems
significant
to
me
is
they
started
out
one
way
to
do
that
and
--
and
that
i
--
i
suppose
was
one
of
the
things
that
--
that
caused
controversy
over
the
bill.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
then
they
end
up
without
saying
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
territory
doesn't
claim
any
--
any
tax
for
1953
other
than
for
these
special
districts
mentioned
in
subdivision
2,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
mean,
their
position
wouldn't
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
--
that
under
those
circumstances
they
--
they
could
have
levied
any
tax
for
1953.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
authority
that
you
know
mr.
arnold
where
to
the
effect
that
that
can
be
done.have
you
--
have
you
run
across
any
cases
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
the
same
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
are
the
in
the
same
posture
as
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here
we
have
--
here
we
have
a
statute
to
levying
a
tax
that
has
gone
through
to
the
highest
court,
and
the
highest
court
has
determined
it
is
valid.
and
8000
people
or
11,000
people
have
paid
that
tax.
and
then
the
legislature
comes
along,
and
according
to
your
theory,
relieves
the
rest
of
them
from
their
obligation
to
pay
those
unquestionably
valid
taxes.
do
you
have
any
--
any
specific
case
in
mind
that
under
those
circumstances
holds
that
the
legislature
can
do
that
without
violating
constitutional
principles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
but
if
there's
the
--
if
there's
a
signature
of
the
--
the
secretary
of
alaska
and
the
seal
of
the
territory,
isn't
that
not
--
to
indicate
that
it's
a
document
of
the
senate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it's
a
public
document,
why
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
