was
that
going
to
be
good
if
you
noticed
it
anyway.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
[laughter]
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
--
the
denial
of
equal
protection
for
a
state
to
forgive
some
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
well
that's
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
this,
attorney
general,
what
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
he
not
make
this
argument
however,
(inaudible)
which
have
been
to
the
current
year
as
well
as
that
which
may
be
assessed
through
the
remainder
of
the
fiscal
year.
is
that
a
good
distinction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
say
that
(inaudible)
to
an
attempt
on
repeal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
divide
that,
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
taxes
which
have
been
levied?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
believe
justice
(inaudible)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
could
it
be
that
the
--
the
various
school
districts
might
assess
for
--
from
any
time
beginning
to
january
1
and
ending
it
december
31
in
the
year
1953.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
only
--
as
i
understand
the
attorney
general,
(inaudible)
that
situation
and
apply
it.
now
applies
in
section
2
(inaudible)
that
section
2
means
that
many
tax
that
has
been
assessed
by
one
of
those
(inaudible)
in
the
current
year.
or
that
maybe
if
that's
--
after
the
passage
(inaudible)
is
that
that
should
be
authorized
by
this
section
2
(inaudible)
only
to
current
years,
its
not
safe
transaction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
arnold,
i
wonder
if
--
if
you
and
justice
brennan
have
really
amended
the
statute
as
you
stated
a
moment
ago.
if
the
comma
were
placed
after
the
word
“assessed”
in
the
next
to
the
last
line,
then
all
preceding
would
relate
to
the
phrase
“during
the
current
fiscal
year”.
and
by
the
mere
insertion
of
a
comma
at
that
point,
would
you
not
have
a
statute
reading
precisely
as
you
and
mr.
justice
brennan
discussed
without
any
amendments?
would
it
not
make
it
clear?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
it
would
say
any
taxes
which
have
been
levied
and
assessed
by
any
municipalities,
school
or
public
utility
district,
under
the
provision
of
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska
1949
as
amended,
or
which
are
levied
and
assessed
"comma"
during
the
current
fiscal
year
of
such
municipality,
etcetera,
recited.
a
punctuation
is
really
no
part
of
the
language,
is
it?
and
is
to
be
put
where
it
is
necessary
to
be
put
to
make
the
language
consistent
and
sensible.
another
rule
of
construction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
--
if
it
changed
the
meaning
of
the
act.
but
if
tends
only
to
make
it
clear
then
would
it
be
changing?
and
i
don't
know
that
there's
anything
to
this
at
all.
i'm
just
thinking
out
loud.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
may
be
quite
right.
i
--
i
know,
i
just
suggest
this
is
a
possible
construction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
how
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
have
to
make
though
under
your
argument
a
savings
clause
out
of
section
2,
do
you
not,
in
order
to
use
the
principle
that
that
which
is
specifically
say
it
excludes
the
general?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
think
it
is
a
savings
clause?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
literally
it
says,
section
1
says,
"all
chapter
10
is
repealed."
then
come
section
2.
but
it
says,
"section
1",
which
is
the
repeal,
"shall
not
be
applicable
to
(a)."
so
--
so
far
as
(a)
covers,
section
--
only
chapter
10
was
not
repealed.
now
that's
what
it
literally
says,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
that's
what
it
means?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
chief
justice,
might
i
ask
just
one
big
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
please
tell
me,
is
it
agreed
by
counsel
on
both
sides
that
this
whole
statute,
chapter
10,
did
not
impose
a
personal
liability
but
only
leans
upon
physical
properties?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
