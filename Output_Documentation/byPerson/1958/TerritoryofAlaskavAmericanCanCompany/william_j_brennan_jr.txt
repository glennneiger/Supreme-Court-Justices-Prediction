justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
attorney
general,
i
gather
that's
as
far
as
the
act
has
gone,
your
position
is
that
there's
been
are
no
question
of
the
right
of
alaska
to
recover
these
delinquent
taxes
for
the
previous
year.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you'd
say
they'd
be
saved
by
the
general
saving
clause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let
me
see
if
i
get
that,
mr.
attorney
general.
is
the
idea
that
because
there
is
a
special
treatment
of
what
it
saved
under
section
2,
section
1,
nothing
else
to
say,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
majority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
tell
me,
have
we
here
anything
more
than
a
question
of
interpretation
of
your
territorial
laws?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
what
--
what
troubles
me,
don't
we
usually
treat
interpretations
of
your
territorial
laws
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
much
as
we
treat
the
interpretations
of
state
laws
by
state
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
workmen's
compensation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
we
overturn
the
interpretation
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
second
question,
was
attached
to
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
that's
you
state,
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
342,
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
does
that
all
add
up
to
this?
section
1
had
the
effect
because
of
the
general
savings
clause
of
leaving
collectibles
still,
the
delinquent
taxes,
for
up
to
year
1952.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
section
2
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
that's
right.
and
then
all
section
2
did
was
make
leviable
again
for
the
year
1953
by
the
municipalities,
school,
and
public
utility
districts,
taxes
for
1953.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
you
could
collect
for
1949
to
1952
inclusive,
plus,
these
taxes
levied
for
1953
under
section
2,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
that
all
adds
up
to
the
rejection
as
you
--
by
the
territorial
legislature
of
any
proposal,
whatever
for
the
cancellation
of
taxes
for
the
prior
years
1949
and
1952
inclusive,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
complete
rejection.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
these
bills
if
you
refer
this
to,
sb
5
and
house
bill
3,
which
would
have
accomplished
the
cancellation,
simply
got
nowhere,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
and
--
and
the
--
the
proposed
section
2
would
have
cancelled
and
forgiven
all
those
taxes
for
the
previous
years,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
instead
of
that,
it
was
determined
that
the
taxes
should
be
collected
for
the
previous
years,
plus,
collection
for
1953
of
those
which
were
levied
under
the
new
section.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
on
--
on
the
matter
of
this
bill,
i
--
i
--
you
raised
the
question
presented
--
your
third
question
presented
whether
the
district
court
was
correct
in
excluding
house
bill
3
and
senate
bill
5.
and
i
gather
from
page
34
of
your
--
the
respondent's
brief,
your
adversary's
brief,
that
he
still
insists
this
is
an
issue
in
the
case
that
we've
got
to
decide,
is
that
right?
suggest
the
case
it's
not
open
for
reception
of
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
trying
to
get
at
it,
do
you
--
we
have
the
question
before
us
the
decision
or
not?
page
two
of
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
third
question
presented
by
you
was
not
before
us
because
there
was
no
position
--
in
opposition
to
yours
taken
by
the
respondent
that
there
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
the
question
and
i
asked
you
are
they
invalid,
to
make
it
clear,
or
you
didn't
understand
them?
are
they
claiming
if
we
can't
take
judicial
notice,
then
what
happened
in
the
legislature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
territory
attorney?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
attorney
general
makes
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
--
you
--
the
authority
of
standing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
arnold,
would
you
--
if
this
would
be
the
same,
we
didn't
have
this
difficulty
with
subdivision
(a).
in
other
words,
the
subdivision
(a)
and
it's
read,
"any
taxes
that
has
gone
away
down,
they
are
levied
and
assessed
during
the
current
fiscal
year."
that's
all
there
was
in
subdivision
(a)
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
my
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
that
there
are
(inaudible)
in
which
not
to
send
a
special
savings
clause,
the
principal
word,
they
would
not
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
leads
me
then
to
my
next
question,
that
you
do
(inaudible)
a
heavy
implication
upon
the
language
to
any
taxes
would
have
been
levied
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
but
i
didn't
quite
get
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
what
you're
arguing
is
now
the
exception
(inaudible),
the
savings
clause,
related
as
--
relating
as
it
does
only
to
previously
assessed
taxes
by
municipalities,
school
or
public
utilities.
we
read
that
way
necessarily
in
that
--
the
extent.
there
is
--
what
savings,
that's
the
extent
of
it
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
we
might
appropriately
or
properly,
whatever
may
be
the
record
below,
consultant
for
such
value
as
they
may
supply
in
the
interpretation
of
section
2?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
was
whether
you
thought
it
would
--
inappropriate
for
us
to
do
precisely
that
in
examining
the
questions,
inspections
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still
don't
get
it
mr.
arnold
whether
you
do
or
don't
object
(inaudible)
the
general
emphasis
and
everything
they
contend.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can
understand
that,
i
wasn't
sure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
we
find
them
ourselves.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
record
they
do
keep
bearing
on
our
question
mr.
arnold,
is
this
the
complete
record
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
the
--
what's
missing
from
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
in
other
sessions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
little
late
for
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
asking
--
i'm
asking
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
asking
only
of
the
published
record,
whatever
is
the
official
record
of
the
territorial
legislature.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
is
a
certificate
(inaudible)
--
has
the
certificate
of
some
territorial
officials,
i
remember
it,
that
this
is
the
record,
we
can't
find
it
offhand,
i
saw
it
earlier.
