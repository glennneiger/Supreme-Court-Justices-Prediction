mr.
j.
gerald
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
question
that
arises
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
territory
of
alaska
may
continue
to
collect
taxes
from
delinquent
taxpayers
after
the
taxing
statute
has
been
repealed.
in
1949,
for
the
first
time,
the
legislature
of
the
territory
of
alaska
passed
a
general
property
tax.
this
was
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1949
and
it
places
or
placed
a
1%
or
10
mills
levy
on
all
real
and
personal
property
within
the
entire
territory
of
alaska.
now,
there
were
some
peculiar
modifications
of
the
peculiar
aspects
of
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska.
for
instance,
the
act
provided
that
municipalities,
school
districts,
and
public
utility
districts
could
keep
the
tax.
now,
many
of
the
cities
at
that
time
were
levying
--
levying
20
mills,
and
the
school
districts
and
--
school
districts
and
public
utility
districts,
generally,
8,
9
to
10
mil.
it
was
the
position
of
the
territory
of
alaska
and
has
been
that
the
first
10
mills
that
every
city
levied
--
was
levied
under
chapter
10,
and
the
act
provided
that
they
could
keep
that
10
mills.
now,
i
--
i
point
that
out
because
it
will
become
apparent
to
you,
later
on,
as
i
argue
about
chapter
22,
session
laws
of
1953,
which
repealed
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska
in
section
1.
but
in
section
2
(a)
of
the
act,
it
does
not
repeal
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1949
as
to
municipalities,
public
utility
districts,
and
school
districts
until
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
of
1953.
now,
they
didn't
say
calendar
year,
they
said
fiscal
year.
and
i
assume
that
that
was
put
on
because
of
the
different
--
municipalities
had
different
fiscal
years.
but
for
all
practical
purposes
it
would
be
for
the
calendar
year
1953.
now,
this
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska
has
had
a
long
and
checkered
career
through
the
courts
of
alaska.
i've
been
attorney
general
now
for
almost
10
years
and
it's
practically
been
my
whole
career,
mr.
chief
justice.
shortly
after
the
act
was
passed,
william
hess,
a
mining
man
in
fairbanks,
alaska
brought
an
action
against
the
territory,
filed
this
action
in
the
fourth
division
district
courts
sought
to
enjoin
mr.
mullaney,
the
tax
commissioner,
from
enforcing
this
act.
a
preliminary
injunction
was
granted
by
judge
kraft
on
the
30th
day
of
january,
1950.
then
that
--
that
preliminary
injunction
was
made
permanent
by
the
same
court
on
june
the
19th,
1950.
on
may
the
10th,
the
territory
then
took
an
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
san
francisco.
and
on
may
the
10th,
1951,
the
ninth
circuit
court
said
that
the
taxpayer
had
sought
the
wrong
remedy.
he
had
an
action
of
law
that
he
should
have
paid
his
taxes
and
sued
for
a
refund.
so,
on
june
the
8th,
1951,
mr.
hess,
having
paid
his
tax,
again
filed
another
action
to
the
district
court
of
the
fourth
division
for
the
return
of
the
tax.
territory
moved
for
change
of
venue.
the
case
was
transferred
to
the
first
division.
and
on
february
the
18th,
1952,
the
district
court
for
the
first
division
of
alaska
held
that
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1949
was
a
valid
taxing
statute.
the
taxpayer
then
took
an
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
court,
on
august
the
4th,
1952.
on
may
the
25th,
1954,
more
than
a
year,
your
honors,
after
the
legislature
of
alaska
had
repealed
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1949,
by
chapter
22,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1953.
we
got
our
decision
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
affirming
the
district
court's
holding
that
this
was
a
valid
taxing
statute.
up
until
that
time
the
territory
collected
some
$400,000
and
under
this
taxing
statute.
there
left
as
near
as
we
could
estimate
some
million
and
a
quarter
dollars
remaining
from
taxpayers.
that
said
portion
which
would
go
to
the
territory.
so
we
--
my
office
decided
that
we
would
then
start
to
try
to
collect
this
by
suits
since
the
taxpayers
were
not
voluntarily
paying.
we
chose
eight
companies.
we
filed
eight
separate
actions
seeking
a
total
of
approximately
$175,000
in
taxes,
interests,
and
penalties.
and
it
is
the
consolidation
of
those
cases
which
is
now
before
the
court.
we
filed
these
cases
or
these
suits
in
april
and
may
of
1959.
on
the
taxes
were
for
the
years
1949,
1950,
1951
and
1952,
not
for
all
taxpayers
for
all
years
but
all
years
where
covered
by
suits
against
some
of
the
taxpayers.
on
june
--
on
january
the
4th,
1956,
the
district
court
at
juneau
dismissed
the
territory's
complaints,
first,
on
the
ground
that
no
personal
action
would
lie.
and
second,
that
the
tax
did
not
survive
the
repeal.
on
february
the
7th,
1956,
the
territory
appealed
the
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
court.
on
november
the
14th,
1956
at
a
hearing
before
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
decided
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
for
the
reason
that
the
court,
in
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
court,
had
failed
to
enter
a
final
judgment.
so
on
december
the
11th,
1956,
the
district
court
in
juneau
did
enter
what
was
then
considered
a
sufficient
final
order.
and
the
territory
took
a
new
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
on
--
on
june
the
27th.
and
on
june
the
27th,
1957,
the
ninth
circuit
court,
by
a
two-to-one
decision,
held
that
section
2
--
yes,
section
2
(a)
of
chapter
22,
session
laws
of
1953,
forgave
the
taxes,
wiped
them
out.
that
there
was
no
tax
liability
left
and
that
we
could
not
collect
the
tax.
then
of
course,
the
territory
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
pointed
out
to
the
court,
this
petition
is
filed
april
the
7th,
1958,
and
pointed
out
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
that
should
they
let
that
decision
stand,
it
would
be
in
violation
--
chapter
22,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1953,
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
privileges
afforded
citizens
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
also,
it
would
violate
the
requirement
of
uniformity
of
taxes
as
set
forth
in
section
9
of
the
organic
act
which
is
the
constitution
of
the
territory
of
alaska.
petition
for
rehearing
was
denied
and
certiorari
--
a
writ
of
certiorari
filed
and
certiorari
granted
by
this
court
on
april
the
7th,
1958.
i
think
i
misquoted
the
date
here
to
you
just
a
minute
ago.
the
--
our
petition
for
rehearing
was
denied
on
december
the
4th,
1957.
now,
let
us
look
closely
at
this
language
of
chapter
22,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1953.
you
will
find
it
on
page
--
set
forth
in
full
on
page
5
of
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
1953.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
1953,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
march
the
12th,
1953
and
it
carried
an
emergency
clause.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
and
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
you
--
you
will
notice
in
the
--
in
the
--
if
you
look
in
our
appendix
on
page
9
of
appendix
a
in
our
brief,
returns,
section
7,
the
first
year
they
had
--
the
returns
were
on
the
15th
of
july
and
the
--
after
that
on
the
15th
day
of
march.
so
a
--
returns
would
have
had
to
have
been
filed
on
the
15th
day
of
march
1953
or
three
days
after
chapter
22
went
into
effect.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
only
in
municipalities,
school
districts
and
public
utility
districts.
it
does
not
permit
it
to
be
levied
in
the
bulk,
the
great
bulk
of
alaska,
the
--
the
so-called
rural
area.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that
is.
if
it
is
not
truly,
it
is
that
the
majority
--
well,
i
guess
the
entire
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
in
our
briefs
keep
calling
this
a
special
savings
clause
or
--
or
saving
clause.
we
--
we
were
chastised
a
bit
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
majority
opinion
for
saying
savings
clause.
well,
there
shouldn't
be
an
“s”
on
that.
i
guess
it
should
be
saving
clause,
although
i
noticed
from
the
--
in
the
minority
opinion
of
judge
healy,
he
reverts
back
to
the
savings
clause,
probably
lead
there
by
the
errors
in
our
brief.
but
it
isn't
truly
a
saving
clause.
it
creates
--
it
--
it
creates
a
new
right.
it
creates
a
new
right
for
the
cities,
the
school
districts
and
the
public
utility
districts
to
collect
taxes
under
chapter
10,
sla,
1949
for
the
year
1953
only.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
set
out
in
--
in
judge
healy's
dissenting
opinion.
he
tells
you
very,
very
clearly
the
--
the
reason
for
that
is
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
i
--
i
suppose,
your
honor,
that
i'm
prejudiced
to
--
whenever
the
dissent
is
with
me
i
always
seem
to
appreciate
it
a
little
more
--
remembering
back
to
seven
years
ago,
mr.
justice
clark,
when
you
dissented.
page
91
of
the
record,
your
honors,
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
page
90,
and
this
is
judge
healy
speaking.
“there
was
a
logical
reason
for
granting
this
right
to
these
local
districts.
in
that
the
legislature
may
well
have
felt
it
undesirable
to
interfere
with
their
current
fiscal
programs
whether
or
not
the
levies
made
for
that
year
had
yet
been
made."
and,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
you
see,
the
reason
why
i
think
it
is
so
important
and
of
the
reason
why
in
1953
i
thought
it
was
important
for
the
senate
finance
or
senate
judicial
committee
--
i
think
it
was
that
finally
put
this
amendment
into
it.
the
reason
i
felt
it
was
important
was
because
under
--
under
my
theory
of
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
the
first
10
mills
that
was
levied
by
a
city
during
this
period
1949
to
1953
was
levied
under
chapter
--
under
chapter
10,
1949,
session
laws,
1949.
now,
if
the
legislature
wiped
out
that
authority
to
levy
that
tax,
here,
the
municipalities
would
be
caught
without
any
authority
to
levy
that
first
10
mills
that
they
levied
20
mills
for
the
first
10
under
chapter
10,
the
other
--
the
second
10
mills
under
their
own
taxing
statutes
or
ordinances.
and
it
would
have
created
financial
havoc
among
the
cities.
and
that
was
the
real
reason.
now,
it
--
it
probably
wouldn't
appear
that
it
would
probably
have
been
much
simpler
if
we'd
just
let
it
go
the
way
the
house
amended
it
and
struck
out,
and
left
section
2
out
entirely.
now,
let's
look
then
at
section
2
(a)
of
chapter
22,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1953,
is
found
on
page
5
of
our
brief.
after
the
title,
we
see
that
section
1
provides
that
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1949,
as
amended.
that
amendment
is
not
pertinent
your
honors
because
it
applies
to
both.
chapter
10
is
hereby
repealed.
now,
we
move
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
no
question
at
all,
justice
brennan,
because
our
--
our
general
saving
statute,
section
19-1-1,
alaska
compiled
laws
annotated,
1949,
would
have
--
would
have
permitted
us
to
collect.
that
--
that
section,
that
saving
--
that
--
our
general
savings
statute,
you'll
find
it
in
our
brief
here,
section
19-1-1.
there
have
been
no
question
--
no
question
at
all.
i
don't
believe
that
any
taxpayer
would
have
--
would
have
questioned
the
right
then
of
the
territory
who
brought
this
suit.
now,
let's
look
at
--
at
section
2.
section
1
of
this
act
shall
not
be
applicable
to
(a).
any
taxes
which
have
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i'm
reading
now
on
page
5,
your
honor,
of
the
brief.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
its
page
5
of
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
of
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
you
have
it.
“any
taxes
which
have
been
levied
and
assessed
by
any
municipality,
school
or
public
utility
district
under
the
provisions
of
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1949,
as
amended,
or
which
are
levied
and
assessed
during
the
current
fiscal
year.”
now,
see
what
it's
says
up
to
this
point?
it
says
any
taxes
which
have
been
levied
or
are
levied
during
the
current
fiscal
year
because
some
of
the
levies
would
have
been
made
prior
to
march
at
the
time
this
repeal
went
through
the
legislature
of
such
municipality,
school
and
public
utility
districts.
so
that
--
that
is
our
position
entirely,
your
honors.
now,
(b)
we
you
don't
need
to
--
we
don't
need
to
be
concerned
about
(b)
because
it
saves
--
it
saves
the
exemptions,
industrial
incentive
exemptions
granted
the
corporations
under
chapter
10,
session
of
laws
of
alaska,
1949.
it's
not
pertinent
to
our
argument
here.
but
this
is
the
crux
of
the
whole
case,
your
honors,
as
what
is
the
meaning
--
what
does
the
--
what
did
the
legislature
of
the
territory
of
alaska
intend
to
do
when
they
passed
section
2
(a)
of
chapter
22.
and
it
is
our
opinion
and
i'll
admit
the
language
is
not
too
clear
because
you
can
--
you
can
--
you
can
read
it
and
justice
healy
in
his
dissent
points
out
that
it
is
ambiguous,
but
why
isn't
this
--
why
isn't
this
a
reasonable
way
to
read
this
statute,
“any
taxes
which
have
been
or
which
are
levied
and
assessed
during
the
current
fiscal
year”?
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
then
--
then
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
which
have
been
or
are
levied
during
the
current
fiscal
year.
then
you
can't
say
it
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
if
--
if
that
is
true,
then
--
then
this
act
does
not
apply
to
--
to
taxes
levied
in
1949,
1950,
1951
and
1952,
has
no
applications
to
taxes
levied
and
assessed
by
municipalities,
school
districts,
and
public
utility
districts
during
those
four
years,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
oh,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
if
it
is
our
position
that
--that
section
2
(a)
of
chapter
--
of
the
chapter
22
of
1953
applies
only
--
and
he's
talking
only
about
the
1953
levy
and
assessment
of
taxes
under
chapter
10,
session
on
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
if
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
if
only,
yes.
it
is.
it
does
not
apply
to
taxes
levied
and
assessed
in
1949,
1950,
1951,
and
1952.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
they'd
be
saved
--
yes,
your
honor.
they'd
be
saved
by
--
by
19-1-1,
act
of
1949.
and
you'll
notice
in
the
--
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
they
--
they
say
--
they
treat
this
section
2
(a)
as
a
special
saving
clause.
they
say
the
special
saving
clause
here
overrides
our
19-1-1,
our
general
saving
clause.
therefore,
they
--
they
say
that
we
are
precluded
from
collecting
any
delinquent
taxes.
and
you
see
the
position
--
the
position
that
puts
us
in
or
--
or
look
at
the
--
look
at
the
--
at
the
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
you
have.
you
need
not
have,
but
you
could
have.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
not.
i'm
thinking
now
of
the
jenkins
case
which
we
had
here
in
--
in
april
of
this
year.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
workmen's
compensation.
i
can't
think
--
that
was
--
that
was
truly
just
the
interpretation
of
the
last
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
you
reversed
--
you
reversed
the
--
the
ninth
circuit.
i
--
i
argued
that
case
en
banc
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
think
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
they
were
seven-two
against
me.
and
if
i
remember
here,
i
think
that
this
court
was
eight
--
reversed
it
by
an
eight-to-one
decision.
that's
my
recollection
at
the
present
time.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
if
you
follow
--
if
you
follow
the
interpretation
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
in
the
majority
opinion,
if
you
follow
the
majority's
opinion,
then
you
must
strike
down
this
repeal.
and,
of
course,
that
would
mean
then
that
we
would
be
burdened
with
collecting
this
tax
not
only
for
1949,
1950,
1951
and
1952,
but
we'd
also
be
burdened
with
collecting
for
1953,
1954,
1955
and
right
on
up
to
date
because
the
--
if
the
repeal
is
unconstitutional,
then
the
--
the
act
would
--
would
still
stand.
but
the
repeal
is
only
unconstitutional
--
yes,
chapter
22
is
only
unconstitutional
if
you
give
it
the
construction
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave
it.
then
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
--
and
--
and
section
9
of
our
organic
act.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i
--
i
don't
think
under
the
--
under
the
holding
of
--
under
the
holding
of
--
of
anderson
versus
mullaney,
a
case
which
i
argued
before
this
court
in
1952,
343
u.s.
415,
and
justice
frankfurter
wrote
--
342
u.s.,
342
u.s.
415.
it
was
justice
frankfurter's
majority
opinion
there
held
that
--
that
the
constitution
under
--
under
section
3
and
--
and
9,
i
believe,
of
the
organic
act
that
the
constitution
applies
to
the
--
to
the
territory
as
well
as
to
a
sovereign
state.
now,
it
was
under
the
--
it
was
under
article
4,
section
2
of
the
privileges
or
immunities
section
of
the
constitution
that
that
case
arose.
but
i
think
that
the
--
the
situation
is
probably
the
same.
at
least
it's
our
--
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
--
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
the
territory
now.
we
--
we
didn't
cite
--
we
didn't
cite
the
--
i'm
--
i
regret
we
didn't
cite
mullaney
or
anderson
--
was
it
--
mullaney
versus
anderson
to
you
in
our
reply
brief.
but
it
gets
very
strong
logic
and
strong
presence
for
our
position
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
apply.
and
of
course
the
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
that's
--
yes,
342
u.s.
415,
mullaney
versus
anderson.
now,
your
honors,
pointing
back
once
more
to
what
the
intent
of
the
legislature
was
in
passing
chapter
22,
session
of
alaska,
1953,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
original
house
bill
number
3
and
senate
bill
number
5.
these
are
found
in
the
record,
if
you
look
on
the
record
on
pages
53
and
54,
53
and
54
has
senate
bill
number
5.
i'll
just
call
your
attention
to
that
and
comment
that
it
is
identical
in
language
with
house
bill
number
3
which
you
will
find
on
page
55
and
56
of
the
record.
now,
if
you
will
notice
the
title,
an
act
to
repeal
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1949,
as
amended,
“and
abrogating
and
repealing
all
accrued
and
unpaid
taxes
levied
thereunder.”
how
much
plainer
could
the
language
have
been?
repealing
all
accrued
and
unpaid
taxes
levied
thereunder.
and
you
get
down
to
section
2
of
the
act.
“that
all
accrued
and
unpaid
taxes
on
real
property
and
improvements,
and
personal
property,
boats
and
vessels
levied
under
the
provisions
of
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1949,
as
amended
by
chapter
88
are
hereby
cancelled,
repealed
and
abrogated
and
declared
null
and
void.”
no
argument
about
it.
as
--
as
judge
healy
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
ninth
circuit,
there's
--
that's
--
that's
plain
language.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
no.
it
was
knocked
out
in
the
house,
one
of
the
committees
in
the
house.
so
it
went
over
to
the
senate
and
the
senate
then
said
--
senate
judiciary
said,
“my
goodness,
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
--
about
these
municipalities,
school
districts,
public
utility
districts
that
are
levying
their
tax
this
year
under
chapter
10.
so
to
protect
them,
they
put
in
a
new
section
2,
which
is
entirely
different
than
this
section."
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
you
have
to
--
you
read
--
you
have
to
read
--
in
my
position,
you
have
to
read
the
have
been
or
maybe
in
the
current
year.
have
been
or
may
--
have
been
or
maybe
levied
in
1953.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
no,
it
did
not.
it
did
not.
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
respondents
contend
that
it
did,
but
we
say
it
did
not.
we
--
we
say
that
--
that
under
--
under
this
section
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
four
years,
1949,
1950,
1951,
1952.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
public
utility
districts,
school
districts.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
right.
that
--
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
two
identical
bills
were
placed
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
in
the
(inaudible).
over
in
the
house
side,
they
put
in
house
bill
3.
on
the
senate
side,
they
put
in
senate
bill
5.
they're
both
there
in
the
record.
they're
identical.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
the
purpose
--
the
purpose
was
to
forgive
all
taxes
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
for
1949,
1950,
1951,
and
1952.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
the
house
bill
got
action
first
and
--
and
when
it
got
into
committee,
they
knocked
out
section
2
which
forgave
the
taxes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
they
sent
it
over
to
the
senate.
the
senate
was
willing
to
accept
that,
but
they
said
we
must
protect
the
cities,
the
school
districts,
and
public
utility
districts
for
the
year
1953
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
so
they
put
in
a
new
section
2.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
including
up
to
--
and
including
1952.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right.
the
territory
could
collect
the
taxes
for
1949,
1950,
1951
and
1952
in
the
rural
areas.
the
cities,
school
districts,
and
public
utility
districts,
now
can
collect,
not
only
for
1949,
1950,
1951
and
1952,
but
they
can
collect
to
1953.
they've
got
something
extra.
they
get
a
little
extra
in
this
repealing
act
that
the
territory
itself
doesn't
get.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
our
position.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
the
senate
bill
5
died.
it
--
it
didn't
get
anywhere.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
the
senate
--
the
house
bill
3
got
through.
it
became
chapter
22,
section
laws
of
alaska
without
section
2,
without
--
with
a
new
section
2.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right,
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
if
i'm
wrong
in
my
position?
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
then
it
simply
means
that
those
taxpayers,
some
8000
who
paid
$400,000
under
chapter
10,
their
--
their
money
stays
in
the
treasury
because
we
--
we're
taking
that
in.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
because
they
paid
and
--
and
the
rest
didn't
pay.we've
been
trying
to
get
them
to
pay
for
10
years.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
it
was
represented
--
they
--
well,
i
--
i
shouldn't
say
that.
that
there
--
the
--
now,
mr.
hess
was
a
mining
man
or
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
some
8000,
i
think.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
individuals,
mostly,
i
think.
there
may
have
been
some
corporations
that
paid
it,
too.i
--
i
couldn't
tell
you,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
the
first
and
right
away,
right
away
in
1949,
when
a
mining
man
filed
a
super
injunction.
that
injunction
was
granted,
you
see,
and
it
was
made
--
it
was
a
temporary
injunction
in
january
that
was
made
permanent
in
june,
i
think,
of
1950.
well,
it
took
us
a
while
to
get
--
the
first
time
it
went
down
the
ninth
circuit
--
you
see,
it
--
it
went
back
on
a
procedural
question.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
some
people
paid
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
some,
yes,
a
total
of
$400,000.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
one
was
offered
in
1951,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i
think
it
passed
the
house
in
1951,
but
that
it
didn't
get
through
the
senate.
so
the
counsel
for
respondents
tell
you
in
their
brief
that
--
that
they
advised
their
--
their
clients
not
to
pay
the
tax
because
if
--
if
they
--
if
--
if
the
1951
bill
went
through,
they're
--
they're
going
to
be
liable
for
them.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
not
--
yes,
our
general
savings
clause.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
cities,
public
school
districts,
and
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
now,
i'll
have
to
add
this,
your
honor,
that
--
that
house
bill
--
that
at
the
trial
in
the
district
court,
there
was
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
territory
to
get
house
bill
3
in
evidence
and
that
it
was
not
permitted
to
go
in.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
i
--
i'd
like
to
look
at
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
page
--
page
48
of
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
the
court
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
the
--
the
district
court,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
have
you
look
at
--
at
the
record
on
page
48.
page
48
of
the
record,
about
three-fourths
of
the
way
down,
just
after
mr.
arnold,
mr.
cameral
and
the
court,
but
the
court
said,
“well
--
well,
it's
not
necessary.”
this
---
this
matter
before
the
court
upon
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
of
plaintiff
in
the
several
cases
consolidated
upon
the
ground
that
it
fails
to
say
the
same
under
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
in
such
a
hearing,
we
cannot
introduce
evidence
of
something
other
than
the
acts
of
the
legislature
or
such
matters
as
journal
entries
of
which
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
indicating
any
such
intent
or
indicating
the
question
of
the
intent.”
what
the
court
is
saying
here
is
that,
in
this
type
of
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
that
it
would
take
judicial
notice
of
a
bill,
an
act
of
the
legislature
that
have
gone
through
the
final
passage,
and
would
take
judicial
notice
to
the
journal
entries,
but
would
not
permit
the
territory
to
introduce,
in
evidence,
a
certified
copy
of
house
bill
3
as
it
was
originally
introduced
in
the
house.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
your
honor,
if
you
will
look
now
at
page
50,
see
what
the
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
court
did.
now,
on
page
50
of
the
record,
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“as
to
the
remedy
taken
by
the
territory,
i
feel
that
there
would
be
nothing
for
the
court
to
do
but
to
dismiss
the
action,
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
we
did
do
that,
we
would
be
doing
precisely
what
was
done
in
the
hess
case.
well,
that
was
the
--
hess
was
a
mining
man
that
first
started
an
attack
on
chapter
4
--
or
chapter
10
of
1949.
we
will
merely
defer
the
more
important
question
of
whether
or
not
the
tax
may
in
--
maybe,
in
fact,
collected
by
property
remedy
--
by
proper
remedy.
and
in
any
attempt
to
dodge
that
issue,
it
is
going
to
come
back
to
the
court
to
be
decided
in
the
future
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
hess
case.
therefore,
i
think
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
not
dispose
of
this
case
entirely
upon
this
issue
of
remedy
but
also
to
look
to
the
merits
of
the
thing
and
try
and
determine
and
so
forth.”
now
--
now
the
case
--
now
the
judge
--
the
court
has
decided
in
going
into
the
merits.and
if
you
look
on
page
52
of
the
record,
mr.
cameral
speaking,
mr.
cameral,
assistant
attorney
general,
your
honor,
in
my
office.
“if
the
court
please,
do
i
understand
that
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
court
is
going
to
decide
this
matter
on
the
merits
and
you
would
like
--”,
the
court
interrupts
and
says,
"yes,
rather
than
on
the
question
of
procedure,
i
feel
that
the
question
of
procedure
that
there
is
--
that
on
the
question
of
procedure,
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
thing
is
not
properly
before
the
court,
but
we
will
try
and
determine
it
instead
on
the
matter
of
the
merits.”
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
now
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
on
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that
--
that
we
were
seeking
--
that
--
that
we
were
seeking
a
personal
action
against
the
taxpayers
instead
of
attempting
to
foreclose
on
the
interest.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
and
went
to
the
merits.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
he
said
--
he
said,
i
could
--
i
could
throw
the
territory
out
of
court
because
you
--
you
sought
the
wrong
remedy,
but
you're
just
--
we're
just
getting
into
a
procedural
hassle
like
we
did
in
the
hess
case.
i
would
like
the
ninth
circuit
send
it
back
and
so
--
so
i'm
going
to
decide
it
on
the
merit.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i
think
it
was
filed
with
the
brief,
as
i
recall.
a
certified
copy
was
filed
with
the
territory's
brief,
as
i
recall.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
i
--
i
believe
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
i
can't
recall
offhand
whether
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
it
has
or
not
but
i
--
i
think
the
court
could
still
take
judicial
notice
of
--
of
the
original
house
bill.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
all
judicial
notice
is
--
is
to
--
not
what
should
be
approved.
i
mean,
it's
right
there.
the
--
the
--
i
think
we
had
a
certified
copy
from
the
secretary.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i'm
not
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
we
--
we
cited
on
the
court
that
it
was
prejudicial
error
to
keep
it
out,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
right.
you're
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
you
know
how
--
your
honor,
you
can
have
the
place
of
meeting
up
there.
you
know
how
well,
we're
a
big
territory
and
--
and
we
do
things
in
a
cheap,
easy
way
and
our
journals,
you
--
you
get
nothing
out
of
our
journals,
so
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
i'll
tell
you.
i
--
i
--
it's
over
--
i'm
so
sorry
that
justice
frankfurter
wasn't
here
because
he
asked
me
six
years
ago,
if
we
didn't
want
to
be
a
state.
and
i
told
him
very
definitely
that
we
did
and
we're
going
to
be
a
state.
and
we're
going
to
be
a
state
as
soon
as
president
eisenhower
issues
that
proclamation,
which
we
anticipate
sometime
early
next
month.
we
--
and
we're
not
going
to
get
any
christmas
presents.
it's
not
going
to
be
for
christmas,
i'm
sure
of
it.
the
mechanics
of
the
thing
--
will
give
it
to
us
about
(inaudible)
christmas,
i
think,
maybe
january
7th.
we
will
get
a
late
christmas
present,
very
happy
about
it.
we're
just
really
elated
about
that.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
we'll
get
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
now
--
now
on
page
34
of
respondent's
brief
they
say
that
the
case
was
not
--
this
case
is
not
open
here
from
the
reception
of
evidence.
in
fact,
it
never
was
in
the
trial
court
either,
but
we
think
it
was
in
the
trial
court,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
on
reflection
and
--
i
said
i
didn't.
i
think
i
asked
but
i
didn't
--
wasn't
too
sure
but
on
reflection
now,
i
remember,
it
definitely
is.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
it
definitely
is.
on
the
flip
side
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
i
don't
think
they
claim
that.
i
think
they
claim
--
i
think
they're
going
along
with
the
trial.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
i
think
that
was
the
trial
judge's
theory,
your
honor.
only
--
i
think
he
--
i
think
he
felt
that
you'd
only
take
judicial
notice
of
a
bill
it
passed.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
it's
not
in
the
journal.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
it
--
the
journal,
we
wish
--
we'd
quote
you
some
of
the
journal
entries,
your
--
your
honor.
the
history
of
the
bill
and
the
journal
and
it
says,
for
instance,
“attorney
general
appeared
and
testified
but
it
doesn't
say
what
the
attorney
general
said
when
he
was
there."
i
think
it
said
mr.
faulkner
appeared
and
testified
but
it
doesn't
say
what
mr.
faulkner
said.
it's
--
it's
not
like
the
congressional
record,
in
other
words.
you
--
you
have
no
--
no
--
no
committee
reports
to
go
to,
like
in
this
case
i
cited
you
mullaney
versus
anderson.
i
--
i
--
really
--
that
we
lost
that
case
here
because
in
the
--
of
some
testimony
in
a
--
in
a
congressional
committee
hearing
which
showed
that
the
--
the
constitution
did
apply
to
alaska.
it
was
on
a
puerto
rican
hearing
and
i
think
the
senator
butler
said,
"well,
it
would
apply
to
the
same
--
the
constitution
applies
with
alaska."
you'll
find
the
footnote
in
this
case
that's
cited
to
you.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
of
course,
i
don't
like
--
i
don't
like
--
i
don't
know
how
you
cross-examine
the
--
the
bill,
i
mean
it's
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
you
mean
as
a
proof
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
it
had
been
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
had
been
introduced.
i
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
apparently
in
this
case,
it
was
--
it
was
going
to
be
necessary,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
to
me
it's
--
it's
a
case
of
first
instance.
i
don't
know
what
--
i
don't
know
of
another
case
where
the
--
had
been
the
similar
procedure
had
been
offered.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
because
then
such
a
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
as
being
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
and
section
9
of
the
organic
act
or
the
territorial
constitution.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
not
that
original
bill.
not
chapter
10,
session
laws
of
1949
but
--
but
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
oh,
oh
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
oh,
yes,
definitely.
yes.
definitely,
because
it
made
no
provision
for
the
some
8000
taxpayers
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
who
would
pay
the
total
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
$400,000.
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
equal
protection
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
uniformity
of
taxes
under
the
section
9
of
the
organic
act.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
i'd
like
to
call
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i'd
like
to
read
that
to
you.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
if
you
look
on
our
brief,
petitioner's
brief
page
4,
48
united
states
code
section
78
and
it
is
section
48-1-1,
alaska
compiled
laws
annotated,
1949
requirements
of
uniform
taxes.
if
--
if
you
will
find
that,
your
honor,
in
--
in
the
brief
for
petitioner,
if
you
find
it
--
it's
the
green
book,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
the
green
book.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
oh,
fine.
fine.
well,
it'll
be
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
it
will
be
the
same.
i'll
--
i'll
read
it.
assessment
--
assessment.
all
taxes
shall
be
uniform
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i'm
reading
from
page
4
now
of
the
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
mr.
justice
black
told
me
you'll
find
the
same
thing
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
“all
taxes
shall
be
uniform
upon
the
same
class
of
subjects
and
shall
be
levied
and
collected
under
general
laws.”
now,
in
other
words,
the
legislature
can
--
can
classify
and
make
taxes
apply
to
different
classes,
but
we
say
that
they
can't
classify
as
--
you
can't
classify
taxpayers
as
into
current
taxpayers
and
delinquent
taxpayer.
that
--
that's
just
--
it
just
--
it
doesn't.
it
violates
all
our
senses
of
what's
right
and
wrong
and
--
and
equity.it
--
it
just
is
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
yes,
of
the
same
class.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
but
these
--
these
taxpayers,
all
of
the
same
class.
i
think
you
can't
classify
them
as
delinquent
and
the
current
taxpayers,
the
same
people.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
no,
because
all
--
we
had
all
of
the
delinquent
taxpayers
had
to
file
lawsuits
or
--
yes.
and
--
and
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
classification
either,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
no.
i
mean,
it's
a
--
if
--
it
is
--
it
is
so
shocking
to
--
i
think
to
--
to
our
legal
system
that
i
just
don't
think
there's
ever
been
any
case
of
that
type.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
no.
if
--
if
you
interpret
chapter
22,
session
laws
of
alaska,
1953,
the
same
as
judge
healy
does
in
his
dissenting
opinion
then
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
point.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i
think
so.
that
--
that's
my
feeling.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
pardon?
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
my
--
that's
my
feeling,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
pardon?
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
the
constitutional
question
was
not
raised
until
we
petitioned
for
rehearing,
your
honor.
the
first
time
that
you
will
--
that
you
will
find
the
constitutional
question
raised
was
on
our
petition
for
a
rehearing.
you'll
notice
on
page
2
--
i
think
you
have
copies
of
the
petition
for
rehearing
on
page
2.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
oh,
you
don't
have
it.
i
guess
it
was
sent
to
the
clerk's
office
but
not
furnished
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
with
what
materials
you
have
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
but
--
but
it
was.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
it
was
raised.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
they
just
denied
our
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
i
don't
think
there
was
any
comment
or
whatnot.
no,
no
comment
on
it.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
oh,
you
mean
--
you
mean
because
--
because
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
they're
in
no
position,
too,
your
honor.
they
can't
sue.
they
have
--
they
can't
have
their
day
in
court.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
nine
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
duties
of
the
attorney
general
9-1,
i'll
give
it
before
you
here
just
in
a
moment,
i
think.
i
think
it's
broad
enough
to
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
to
require
--
recalling
just
from
memory
it
--
it
says
that
--
until
my
assistant
finds
it
--
that
if
there's
reasonable
doubt
to
believe
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
if
the
--
if
the
welfare
of
a
substantial
part
of
the
--
yes,
it's
section
9-1-5.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
you
will
find
it
in
the
reply
--
reply
brief
of
petitioners.
and
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
you
will
find
it
in
the
appendix,
your
honor,
appendix
a
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
duties
of
the
attorney
general.
you'll
find
it
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
no,
no.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that's
right.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
that
is
--
that
is
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
no.
no,
the
interpretation
--
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
the
only
thing
that's
been
in
from
the
start.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
on
our
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
well,
when
you
see
the
organic,
i
give
the
constitutional
question.
the
federal
constitution
and
the
state
--
and
the
state
constitution,
using
state
in
the
territory
and
interchange
the
term.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
right,
right.
that's
right.
in
fact,
by
congress
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
congress
gave
us
our
constitution,
that's
it.
i'm
sorry
justice
brennan.
i
looked
on
page
--
appendix
b
--
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
--
3,
yes.
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
forgot
to
do
that.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
you
mean
--
you
mean
--
you
mean,
not
the
u.s.
attorney
general,
the
territory
attorney.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes,
the
territory
attorney.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
gerald
williams
yes.
for
--
for
the
collection
of
taxes.
in
the
brief
time
i
have
left
your
honors,
i
--
i
think
that's
about
all
i
can
touch
on
is
the
--
is
to
mention
the
rules
of
construction
that
would
have
to
apply
following
our
reasoning.
and
the
first
one
that
we
call
to
your
attention
is
when
an
act
is
susceptible
of
more
than
one
construction,
one
of
which
is
doubtful
or
of
doubtful
validity,
the
court
should
adopt
the
valid
interpretation.
of
course,
that
puts
us
right
back
into
how
you're
going
to
construe
chapter
22.
second,
an
unjust
result
is
to
be
avoided
in
statutory
construction
and
we
think
it's
an
unjust.
i
feel
sure
that
on
the
reflection
of
this
court
to
consider
that
an
unjust.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
sir.
