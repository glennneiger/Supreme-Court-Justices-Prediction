justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general,
we
are
coming
to
the
basic
merits
again.
you
told
us
as
i
understood
you,
first
of
all,
you
advanced
your
construction
of
this
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
told
us
that
if
we're
--
if
they
were
not
so
construed,
this
court
would
be
compelled
to
hold
that
the
property
tax
never
had
been
repealed
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
don't
know
that
you've
told
us
why
we
would
be
compelled
to
hold
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
position
therefore
that
the
original
bill
(inaudible)
would've
been
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
what
appears
on
page
52
of
the
merits
(inaudible)
--
this
original
legislation
that
--
that
the
court
excluded
about
which
we've
--
which
we
just
been
discussing.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
point
that
that
would
have
been
unconstitutional
had
it
passed?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
your
point
is
it's
--
it
is
if
unless
there's
a
reasonable
classification.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
mr.
attorney
general,
we
don't
need
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
assuming
the
territory
of
alaska
is
in
a
position
to
raise
it.
if
you're
correct
about
the
effect
of
the
organic
statute,
assuming
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
territory
is
in
a
position
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
raise
that.
now
would
that
--
would
--
has
that
been
issue
in
the
case
from
the
beginning,
the
effect
of
the
organic
law?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
--
where
--
at
what
stage
before
you
came
to
this
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
did
you
raise
that?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
constitutional
and
the
organic.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
that.
the
organic
--
the
organic
--
the
organic
act
is
the
equivalent
of
a
state
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
puerto
rico
is
in
a
different
status
from
alaska,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
a
territory.
justice
potter
stewart
about
to
change.
justice
potter
stewart
this
decision
was
made
when
puerto
rico
was
a
territory?
