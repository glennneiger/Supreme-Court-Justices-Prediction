they
just
leave
you
on
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
subcommittee
determine
if
a
license
is
to
be
denied
or
lets
all
the
board
view
it
before
that's
determined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without,
themselves,
viewing
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
their
practice,
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
picture
is
not
permitted
to
be
shown
to
anybody,
is
it?
it
isn't
merely
people
who
are
going
to
the
public
schools
or
to
educational
institutions
in
new
york.
it
can't
be
shown
to
anybody.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
see
how
far
that
your
argument
cuts.
what
if
the
new
york
legislature
decided
that
--
to
put
the
censorship
of
newspapers
under
their
department
of
education?
would
--
would
that,
in
your
view
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
authorize
prior
censorship
of
newspapers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
comic
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
giving
that
over
to
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
having
a
little
difficulty
following
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
this
is
--
this
has
educational
objectives.
i
don't
quite
see
the
relevance
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
they
are
married.
