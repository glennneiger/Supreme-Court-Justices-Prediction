mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
chief
justice
warren
and
gentlemen
of
the
court,
i
recognize
the
hour
is
late
and
all
i
think
i
should
do
at
this
time
is
to
present
to
you
what
i
think
the
merits
or
the
issues
that
are
present
here,
leaving
through
the
brief,
and
particularly,
from
judge
conway's
very
carefully
thought
out
opinion
in
this
case,
the
arguments
on
the
law.
i
think
i
could
take
care
of
the
case
in
handling
it
that
way
and
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
the
court
for
me
to
do
just
that.
now,
in
the
first
place,
i
think
its
desirable
for
me,
once
again,
to
tell
the
court
a
little
bit
about
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
board
of
regents
are
a
unique
body.
i
do
not
know
that,
in
any
other
state,
we
have
a
board
of
regents
which
has
entire
jurisdiction
over
all
educational
matters
in
the
entire
state.
the
board
of
regents
has
jurisdiction
over
all
schools,
all
colleges,
all
museums,
all
libraries,
adult
education,
kindergarten
education.
and,
the
--
and
the
court
--
and,
the
legislature,
just
last
year,
has
told
us
that
we
also
have
jurisdiction
over
children
with
i.q.starting
at
zero
all
the
way
up
to
21.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
experts
on
life.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
the
board
of
regents
consists
of
13
members.
they
are
elected
by
the
board
of
--
by
the
legislature
once
each
year
and,
consequently,
they
each
have
a
term
of
13
years.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
they
come
from
all
over
the
state.
they
come
from
every
walk
of
life.
there
--
there
are
lawyers,
there
are
doctors,
there
are
farmers,
there
are
bankers,
there
is
no
--
no
restrictions,
just
happens
to
be
the
fellow
that
happens
to
be
appointed.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
what
happens
is
this,
in
connection
with
the
procedure.
we
have
a
licensing
bureau
which
examines
this
picture.
if
the
bureau
finds
no
problem,
the
picture
is
then
licensed.
if
there
is
a
problem,
then
the
matter
goes
to
the
regents.
the
regents
have
a
subcommittee
to
view
it.
if
the
subcommittee
thinks
it's
desirable
for
the
whole
board
to
view
it,
the
whole
board
will
view
it.
i
think
most
of
the
members
of
the
board
of
regents
viewed
this
particular
picture
where
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
the
board
has
the
power,
i
think,
to
act
on
the
recommendation
of
the
committee
for
which
it
is
so
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
to
do.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that
is
so,
if
they
wish
so
to
do,
but
they,
themselves,
have
the
right
to
look
at
it
if
they
want
to.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
it
depends
a
little
bit
upon
the
--
what
they
regard
as
the
seriousness
of
the
picture,
your
honor.
if
the
picture
is
one
that
seems
to
be
of
a
picture
like
this
that
needs
consideration,
they
all
look
at
it.
now,
what
i'm
building
up
to
this
to
say
to
your
honors
about
the
board
of
regents,
in
dealing
with
this
matter,
is
this.
that,
in
1927,
there
were
a
great
many
commissions
and
bureaus
all
over
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
people
thought
that
that
was
not
the
way
to
operate
in
that
state.
so,
they
passed
a
constitutional
amendment
which
said
that
there
could
be
only
18
state
departments
and
that
every
bureau,
commission's
bureau,
and
everything
else
had
to
be
assigned
to
one
of
those
departments.
the
motion
picture
commission,
as
originally
had
been
set
up,
was
a
separate
organization
and,
after
this
constitutional
amendment,
it
became
essential
to
determine
where
that
commission
should
be
assigned
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
in
its
assignment.
the
legislature
finally
assigned
to
the
education
department,
and
i
think
one
of
the
difficulties,
perhaps
in
my
earlier
arguments
here
and
in
the
discussion
of
this
case
as
we've
had
it
heretofore,
has
been
that
i
don't
think
any
of
us
are
recognizing
the
fact
that
when
they
put
this
thing
in
the
education
department
of
the
state
of
new
york,
they
were
treating
this
matter
as
an
educational
matter.
that
when
they
said,
“you
license
motion
pictures,”
they
were
the
--
saying
the
same
thing
to
the
board
of
regents
as
when
they
said
to
the
board
of
regents
“you
license
a
trade
school
or
you
license
a
doctor
or
you
license
a
--
some
procedure
in
the
field
of
education
irrespective
of
the
area,
whether
it's
a
nursery
school
or
whether
it's
hotel
education.”
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
yes,
and
what
i'm
following
through
on
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
on
that
is
this.
when
we
license
a
trade
school,
only
those
people
who
want
to
run
the
trade
school
can
operate
it
without
the
license.
now,
anybody
in
the
state
of
new
york
would
be
dealing
with
that
thing.
when
we
license
a
motion
picture,
we
have
a
licensing
procedure
and,
in
all
of
these
things,
the
legislature
has
set
up
standards
for
licensure.
and,
what
i'm
saying
here
now
is,
is
i
think
we're
failing
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
legislature
in
new
york
has
tried
to
set
standards
for
trade
schools,
standards
for
colleges
because
no
college
can
function
in
the
state
of
new
york
without
a
license
from
the
board
of
regents,
standard
for
an
educational
thing
which
the
legislature
has
now
decreed,
motion
pictures
is
an
education
thing.
and,
the
legislature
has
set
up
standards
for
the
licensure
of
motion
pictures.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
has
been
under
discussion
but
the
legislature
has
not
seen
fit
to
draw
any
distinctions.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that's
right.
we
have
now
jurisdiction
to
control
it,
and
that
is
correct
and
that's
the
way
the
thing
works.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that's
right.
it's
--
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
the
penal
law
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
provides
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
the
penal
law
provides
that
your
honor
is
correct.
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
provides
that
once
the
commission
--
the
board
of
regents
license
a
motion
picture,
the
motion
picture
can
be
shown
anywhere
and
is
not
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
penal
law.
and,
the
same
thing
would
be
true
with
the
trade
school,
and
the
same
thing
would
be
true
with
anything
else
that
we
license.
so
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
well,
it
might
if
they
--
if
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
if
--
if
they
--
if
they
set
up
standards
--
if
they
set
up
standards.
i
can't
conceive
what
that
they
would
do
that.
i
think
it's
a
question
that
i
would,
from
my
viewpoint,
regard
as
academic,
but
there
was
a
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
people
in
the
legislature
that
there
ought
to
be
standards
that
somebody
should
pass
upon
in
dealing
with
motion
pictures.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
there's
been
discussion
of
comic
books
in
the
legislature.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that's
right,
and
the
board
of
regents
has
no
enthusiasm
for
that
and
legislature
has
not
passed
that
kind
of
a
procedure
yet.
so
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
my
only
argument
that,
i
think,
i'm
presenting
is
that,
by
putting
it
in
the
education
department
and
assigning
it
to
the
board
of
regents,
the
legislature
must
have
regarded
it
as
an
educational
matter
and
that
the
regents,
in
passing
upon
it,
were
passing
upon
it
within
the
area
of
the
constitutional
authority
to
deal
with
motion
pictures
or
to
deal
with
educational
matters
only
because
they
have
adult
education,
they
have
kindergartens,
they
have
everything
else
under
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
the
regents
have
no
jurisdiction
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
books,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
--
any
body
that
is
given
any
authority
to
deal
with
books,
nor
is
there
anybody
that's
given
authority
to
deal
with
what
actually
transpires
in
the
theater,
nor
is
there
anybody
given
any
jurisdiction
over
what
happens
on
television.
those
things
have
not
been
dealt
with
one
way
or
the
other,
but
i
do
not
think
that
those
problems
are
before
this
court.
now,
what
i
--
i
want
to
try
to
do
here,
if
i
can,
is
to
be
sure
that
i
get
what
i
regard
as
a
very
narrow
issue
that's
involved.
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
like
all
of
these
other
things,
the
legislature
has
set
up
standards.
if
those
standards
are
any
good,
why,
then,
the
regents
ought
to
be
able
to
apply
them.if
the
standards
are
no
good,
why,
then,
we
ought
to
go
back
to
the
legislature
and
get
proper
standards.
and,
i
think
--
and,
i
think
the
legislature
felt
that
that's
what
this
court
was
saying
in
all
of
these
prior
cases
that
when,
in
certain
areas
such
as
obscenity,
and
i
do
not
think
that
rules
out
sexual
immorality
because
i'm
taking
position
here
and
regents
feel
that
there
is
no
difference
between
obscenity
and
sexual
immorality
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
for
both
reasons,
your
honor,
sexual
immorality
and,
also,
that
one.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
was
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
think
that's
true
but
i
think
that,
irrespective
of
whether
they
happen,
i
--
i
think
that
the
both
are
in
this
picture.
you
got
adultery
and
anybody
that
sees
this
picture
has
got
to
confess,
notwithstanding
my
worthy
opponent,
that
this
glorifies
adultery.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
fact
in
this
picture.
i
think
you've
got
that
in
the
picture.
i
also
think,
at
the
same
time,
that
you
have
scenes,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
made
any
difference
whether
they
happened
to
be
husband
and
wife
or
what
they
happened
to
be,
they
have
scenes
that
lead
up
to
sexual
intercourse.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
--
i
think
it
adds
one
additional
step
if
they're
not
married,
but
i
think
that
you
could
have
obscenity
between
people
of
opposite
sex
even
though
they're
not
married.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
even
though
they
are
married
or
even
though
they're
not
married.
i
think
it
can
be
both
ways,
as
far
as
exhibition
to
the
public
is
concerned,
yes.
so
that,
our
--
our
position,
i
think,
is
very
clarifying
is
as
i
can
answer
that
the
legislature
recognizing
everything
that
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
the
need
of
a
clear
standard
to
guide
the
board
of
regents,
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
i
should
say,
parenthetically,
that
this
act
of
the
regent
--
of
the
legislature
was
not
the
recommendation
primarily
of
the
board
of
regents.
this
statute
was
drawn
by
the
counsel
for
the
governor.
it
was
backed
by
the
parties
--
both
parties
in
the
legislature
and
passed
unanimously.
and,
while
of
course
the
regents
endorsed
it,
as
did
every
other
educational
group
of
the
state,
the
school
boards,
the
parent-teachers,
and
that's
one
reason
why
i
think
we're
dealing
with
an
educational
problem
because
the
people
that
are
concerned
with
education
came
in
and
said,
“we
want
this
statute,”
and
the
legislature
passed
it
unanimously,
trying
to
rectify
and
to
set
up
a
standard
which
they
hope
this
court
would
think
met
the
minimum
requirements
for
standards.
so,
when
they
said
sexual
immorality
and
the
discussion
was
this,
that
unless
you
try
by
outlining
in
specific
detail
the
acts
of
fornications,
that
you
can
--
you've
gone
as
far
as
you
need
to
go
when
you
use
the
term
“sexual
immorality.”
that
that
is
a
clear
expression
of
language
which
everybody
understands
and
which
everybody
knows.
now,
you
cannot
look
at
this
picture
without
recognizing
the
fact
that
the
scenes
that
have
been
pointed
out
in
the
record
are
scenes
which
are
sexually
immoral.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
i
don't
think
any
normal
person
looking
at
that
picture
would
feel
it.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
go
that
far,
as
far
as
these
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
things
are
concerned.
now,
there
are
--
there
are
worse
films.
there
are
worse
degrees
of
pornographic
type
of
a
film,
but
i
have
never
seen
a
film
that
has
been
--
that
it
has
been
desired
to
show
to
the
general
public
that
goes
as
far
pornographically,
indecently,
sexually,
immoral
--
immorally,
obscenitively,
if
i
can
get
my
right
adjectives
in
here,
than
this
particular
picture.
and
then,
in
addiction
to
that,
it
does
exactly,
as
justice
stewart
said
a
moment
ago,
it
depicts
adultery
which
everybody
all
through
the
years
has
recognized
as
improper.
it
depicts
that
as
a
proper
standard
of
behavior.
now,
when
you
get
through
that
picture,
you
cannot
fail
to
recognize
that
that's
exactly
what
it
does.
now,
the
legislature
has
set
that
up
of
a
--
as
a
standard.
and,
this
picture,
on
whether
the
term
meets
the
standard
or
whatever
i
could
say
about
it,
but
it
certainly
comes
within
the
provisions
of
the
language
in
dealing
with
that
standard.
now,
if
that
standard
is
no
good,
why,
then,
the
legislature
has
failed
to
do
what
it
tried
to
do.
but
if
that
standard
is
a
reasonable
one,
and
i
think
that
the
regents
were
convinced
that
it
was
and
i'm
sure
that
the
people
that
endorsed
the
decision
of
justice
--
of
judge
conway
felt
that
it
was,
if
that's
a
reasonable
standard,
then,
i
think,
that
it
ought
to
permissible
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
decide
that
this
is
the
type
of
procedure
that
we
want
followed
in
the
licensure
because,
now,
once
again,
i
want
to
go
back
to
that
we're
licensing
motion
pictures
and
we're
licensing
under
a
degree
of
a
standard.
and,
if
they
meet
these
standards,
we
have
no
choice.
what
i
said
in
my
brief,
and
let
me
reiterate
it
here,
is
that
the
legislature
and
not
the
regents
have
said
that
this
picture
should
not
be
shown.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
well,
i
assume
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
well,
i
--
the
same
argument
that's
being
presented
to
this
court,
that
there
should
be
no
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
prior
restraint,
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
think
they
decided
that
case
--
question
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
well,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
follow
your
question
then.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that's
the
law
of
new
york.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
burstyn
case,
there
were
a
number
of
decisions
by
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
licensing
procedure
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
well,
i'd
say
both.
i
mean,
when
each
--
when
each
picture
comes
up
for
discussion,
the
argument
was
presented.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
to
the
particular
picture
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
think
the
court
held,
your
honor,
that
the
licensing
statute,
generally,
in
the
state
of
new
york
was
constitutional.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
do
not
know
of
any
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
where
anybody
tried
to
run
the
picture
and
forced
us
to
arrest
them
and
claim
that
we
had
no
right
to
do
that.
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
true,
but
i'm
sure
that,
in
all
of
the
cases
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that's
correct,
on
the
ground
that
they
had
no
license
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
not
on
the
ground
as
to
the
type
of
picture,
that
would
be
true.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
that's
right
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
under
the
present
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
right
if
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean.
i'm
not
too
clear
in
my
own
mind
as
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
understand
it
clearly
myself,
but
as
i
--
as
i
understand
the
situation,
the
courts
of
new
york
state
have
passed
again
and
again
upon
the
right
upon
the
constitutionality
of
any
motion
picture
or
the
necessity
of
any
motion
picture
being
submitted
for
a
license.
we
have
not
had
a
case
where
there's
any
rejection
ever
been
raised
where
our
power
to
licensure
has
been
challenged.
i
think
that's
true
in
that
type
of
a
case.
now,
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
we've
got
a
procedure
that
we're
dealing
with,
and
the
procedure
has
been
turned
over
to
the
regents,
a
general
overall
job
of
looking
at
pictures.
it
could
have
been
--
the
legislature
could
have
done
it
in
any
other
way.
the
legislature
could
have
turned
it
over
to
the
supreme
court.
the
legislature
could
have
turned
it
--
left
it
to
the
ordinary
procedures
under
the
penal
law,
of
course,
they
could.
but,
i
regard
this
as
a
method
and
an
educational
method
because
i
do
think
that
that
has
something
to
do
with
this
problem,
an
educational
method
of
entrusting
to
people
who
are
dealing
statewide
with
this
whole
problem
of
education
to
determine
whether
motion
pictures
should
or
not
be
licensed.
and,
i
say
that
the
only
problem
that
i
see
and
the
only
problem
in
this
case
that
i
see,
and
i
hope
that
it's
a
narrow
one,
as
to
whether
this
particular
picture
comes
within
the
present
statutory
standards
which
have
been
laid
down
by
the
legislature.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
as
i
understood
judge
voorhis'
decision,
and
maybe
i
don't
quite
understand
it,
but
i
thought
that
he
--
that
he
agreed
with
the
majority
here
but
he
felt
that
we
should
have
used
the
word
“obscene”
rather
than
utilizing
the
term
“sexual
immorality”
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
--
that
he
thought
it's
better
to
go
back
to
the
regents
so
that
they
could
correct
the
record.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
think
he
was
--
he
agreed
with
the
regents
that
the
--
that
the
things
that
we
thought
were
objectionable
should
be
eliminated.
that's
the
way
i
understood
his
decision.
mr.
charles
a.
brind,
jr.
i
appreciate
your
honor
for
giving
me
this
extra
time,
and
thank
you
very
much.
