mr.
ephraim
london
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
the
order
sustained
a
ban
of
a
moving
picture.
the
name
of
the
picture
is
lady
chatterley's
lover
based
on
a
novel
by
d.h.lawrence.
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
a
film
may
not
be
shown
in
a
public
theater
until
it
has
first
been
shown
to
a
board
of
censors
known
as
the
motion
picture
division,
and
it
is
approved
and
licensed
by
that
division.
the
motion
picture
division
is
an
agency
of
the
department
of
education
which
is
governed
by
the
board
of
regents
and,
hence,
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
the
regents
of
the
state
of
new
york.
originally,
when
the
film
was
submitted
to
the
motion
picture
division,
the
division
indicated
that
it
would
not
license
the
film
unless
three
short
sequences,
taking
about
two
minutes
in
all,
were
deleted.
the
appellant,
the
distributor
of
the
film
who
owns
the
exhibition
rights,
refused
to
make
any
deletion
and
appealed,
as
he
was
required
to
do,
to
the
regents.
the
regents
decided
that
not
only
were
the
three
short
sequences
immoral,
but
that
the
whole
picture
was
immoral.
an
appeal
was
taken
from
a
--
from
the
determination
of
the
regents
to
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
the
appellate
division
held
the
statute,
under
which,
the
film
was
banned
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
regents
then
appealed
to
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals,
and
that
court
reversed
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division.
now,
there
is
no
majority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
three
of
the
judges
ruled
that
the
statutes
in
question
were
constitutional.
three
voted
for
--
to
affirm
the
lower
court
which
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
one
judge
who
cast
the
deciding
vote
stated
that
he
wasn't
sure
whether
the
statute
was
constitutional
or
not
and
that
this
court
ought
to
decide
the
question,
and
it
is
now
here
before
you.
now,
we
are
seeking
various
kinds
of
relief.
we
first
seek
a
declaration
from
this
court,
as
we
did
below,
by
the
way,
that
the
entire
film
licensing
system
be
declared
unconstitutional
as
a
prohibited
form
of
prior
restraint
of
communication.
if
that
relief
is
not
granted
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
across
the
board,
without
any
question
relating
to
the
application
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
ephraim
london
without
any
question
relating
to
the
particular
formulation
of
this
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
if
the
statute
said,
merely,
that
films
shall
be
denied
a
license
if
they
are
obscene
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
and
all
other
films
shall
be
granted
license
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
that
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
is
our
main
contention.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
do,
your
honor,
but
i
do
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
their
--
the
court
has
decided
the
case
since
before
this
one
arose
on
the
narrowest
possible
grounds.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
would
not,
your
honor,
if
we
can
possibly
get
a
determination,
because
there's
been
nothing
but
confusion
in
the
lower
courts.
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
--
that
the
case
of
burstyn
against
wilson,
which
was
the
first
case
in
which
the
court
held
that
movies
were
a
form
of
communication
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
has
been
interpreted
in
as
many
possible
ways
as
there
are
courts,
almost,
at
least
four
or
five
different
interpretations
have
been
--
mr.
ephraim
london
pardon
me,
your
honor?
i
didn't
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
make
clear
its
position
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
licensing
laws
are
constitutional,
the
lower
courts
would
--
would
certainly
be
guided
by
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
meaning
that
all
such
licensing
laws
are
unconstitutional.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
read
your
honor's
opinion
in
the
kingsley
book
case,
that
might
almost
seem
to
lead
to
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
shall
i
read
the
particular
phrase?
mr.
ephraim
london
i
hope
that
your
honor
isn't
confirmed
in
the
opinion
that
that
was
an
error.
the
--
if
the
relief
sought,
namely,
that
the
entire
system
is
unconstitutional,
is
not
granted,
we
seek
a
determination
that
the
statute
is
void
and
that
it
authorizes
the
suppression
of
a
film
on
the
ground
that
it
is
immoral.
now,
there
are
two
prongs
to
that
argument.
the
first,
that
the
term
“immoral”
as
defined
by
the
legislature
is
so
vague
as
to
permit
the
suppression
of
speech
which
is
protected
by
the
constitution
and,
for
that
reason,
it
offends
against
the
due
process
clause.
and,
the
second
prong
for
that
point
or
argument
is
that
the
statute,
as
interpreted,
permits
the
suppression
of
ideas,
the
suppression
of
advocacy
and
it
is,
for
that
reason,
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech.
now,
if
that
relief
is
also
denied,
we
seek
an
order
reversing
the
ban
of
this
particular
film
on
the
ground
that
it
is
not
of
a
type
of
film
that
may
be
suppressed,
that
it
has
social
values
and
social
importance
that
the
constitution
protects,
and
that
far-outweighs
any
possible
legal
objection
to
the
film.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
that
the
entire
licensing
law
is
invalid.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
your
honors
haven't
seen
the
film
itself.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
--
i
was
going
to
refer
to
it
but
it's
--
the
last
point
is
a
point
relating
to
the
--
to
the
meaning
of
the
film,
the
values
of
the
film,
and
i
think
that
the
argument,
your
honor,
should
--
must
necessarily
be
the
preface
because
i
don't
think
that
the
court
will
be
able
to
follow
the
argument
--
a
prolonged
argument
without
having
seeing
the
picture.
mr.
ephraim
london
in
view
of
the
limitation
of
time,
i
will,
if
your
honor
put
--
if
your
honor
wishes,
proceed
to
the
--
mr.
ephraim
london
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
then
to
proceed
on
in
arguing
the
broadest
possible
question.
now,
the
brief
submitted
by
the
regents
says,
in
effect,
in
--
in
discussing
this
question
that
--
well,
there
they
go
again
raising
that
same
old
first
amendment
issue,
which
has
been
presented
before
and
i
don't
think
we
need
to
apologize
for
resorting
to
our
fundamental
rights
and
the
sources
of
those
rights,
when
the
fundamental
right
of
free
speech
has
been
denied.
the
question
was
deliberately
left
open
in
the
case
of
burstyn
against
wilson.
in
that
case,
the
court
characterized
the
very
law
that's
under
consideration
here
as
unbridled
censorship,
as
a
form
of
prior
restraint
to
be
especially
condemned,
and
stated
that
the
state
of
new
york
is
under
a
heavy
burden
to
demonstrate
the
necessity
for
allowing
any
such
censorship.
the
regents
have
interpreted
that
decision
to
mean
that
this
court
has
countenanced
and
sustained
the
validity
of
prior
censorship
laws.
the
opinion
of
judge
conway
in
the
court
below
seems
to
have
read
that
the
--
i
mean,
in
the
opinion,
judge
conway
seems
to
have
read
the
court's
opinion
in
the
burstyn
case
in
precisely
the
same
way.
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
language
in
the
opinion
that
would
justify
that
conclusion.
and,
in
fact,
every
case
involving
moving
--
moving
picture
licensing
laws
that
has
come
before
the
court
since
that
time,
and
there
have
been
five,
in
every
case,
the
court
has
reversed
the
determination
suppressing
the
particular
film.
the
reason
that
we
find
the
law
--
the
licensing
law
particularly
offensive
is
it
one
must,
in
order
to
exercise
his
right
of
communication,
and
this
court
has
recognized
the
right
to
show
a
film
or
has
recognized
films
as
a
mean
of
communication,
is
that
one
must
come
hand
in
hand
in
order
to
secure
permission
to
exercise
his
right
of
expression
and
the
public
may
not
be
allowed
to
see
a
picture
or
to
receive
a
communication
until
it
has
been
--
it
has
been
certified
as
fit
for
approval
by
this
censorship
body.
under
the
law
of
new
york,
as
it
is
--
now
exists,
there
is
very
little
right
of
review
of
a
decision
of
the
administrative
board
in
the
respect
that
its
determination
of
the
facts
cannot
be
reversed
unless
its
determination
is
clearly
unreasonable.
the
burden
is
placed
on
whoever
owns
the
rights
to
the
picture
to
show
that
this
determination
of
the
--
of
the
regents
or
the
administrative
board
was
unreasonable,
and
it's
an
impossible
burden
to
sustain.
and,
i
believe,
in
the
history
of
the
state
of
new
york,
it
has
been
sustained
only
once
and
the
question
of
fact.
this
law
has
been,
in
effect,
i
believe,
since
about
1911
in
various
forms.
i
may
not
be
sure
that
--
i
may
not
be
correct
about
the
date,
but
it
has
been
in
effect
for
a
very
long
time
and
only
once
was
there
a
reversal
on
the
facts.
there
had
been
several
reversals
based
on
the
finding
that
the
law
was,
in
part,
unconstitutional.
but,
now,
with
respect
to
this
burden
that
is
placed
on
the
one
who
would
show
his
picture,
i
think
it's
best
illustrated
by
this
particular
case.
we
have
here
a
finding
that
the
film
is
immoral
and,
according
to
the
court,
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
it's
immoral
must
be
made
in
accordance
with
the
mores
and
standards
of
the
community.
the
distributor
of
the
picture
must,
to
convince
the
court
that
the
determination
of
the
regents
of
the
censorship
board
was
improper
and
unreasonable,
show
that
the
community
standings
are
different
that
the
--
that
the
picture
is
not
really
immoral
in
accordance
with
the
community
standards.
in
short,
he
must
prove
the
community
standards
or
reaction
to
a
picture
which
he
cannot
show
to
the
public
or
to
the
community.
even
if
he
were
permitted
to
show
the
picture
to
the
community,
how
is
one
to
prove
what
the
community
standards
are
with
respect
to
a
particular
problem?
how
can
that
burden
of
proof
be
sustained
by
the
owner
of
a
film?
mr.
ephraim
london
they
did
and,
as
matter
of
fact,
they
redefined
it
in
the
terms
that
this
court
found
unconstitutionally
vague.
may
i
address
myself
to
that
question,
your
honor?
mr.
ephraim
london
it's
confined
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
to
the
area
of
sexual
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
immorality.
mr.
ephraim
london
may
i
read
that
section,
your
honor?
mr.
ephraim
london
but
before
--
before
reading
it
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
--
i
would
like
to
discuss,
just
for
a
moment,
the
background
of
section
122-a.
in
1954,
this
court
had
before
it
the
picture
--
the
--
the
case
of
commercial
pictures
cooperation
against
the
regents
in
which
the
new
york
statute
was
involved.
the
statute,
as
it
then
read
in
1954
and
as
it's
germane
to
this
case,
provided
that
a
license
would
be
--
would
be
issued
if
--
unless
a
picture
was
found
immoral,
and
just
the
word
“immoral”
was
used.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
in
passing
on
the
statute
and
on
the
--
in
that
particular
case,
ruled
that
the
term
“immoral,”
as
used
in
the
statute,
was
limited
to
sexual
immorality.
this
court,
of
course,
was
bound
by
the
interpretation
or
construction
of
the
law
that
was
placed
on
it
by
the
highest
court
of
new
york.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
counsel
for
the
regents,
who
also
appear
in
this
case,
argued
to
this
court
that
it
was
bound
by
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
the
word
“immoral,”
as
used
in
section
122
of
the
law,
meant
sexually
immoral.
within
four
months
after
the
decision
or
the
opinion
of
this
court
was
handed
down,
the
new
york
state
legislature
enacted
section
122-a,
purportedly,
to
cure
that
vagueness,
to
make
the
statute
definite.
and,
now,
may
i
read
it?
it
defines
the
term
“immoral,”
as
used
in
section
122,
to
mean
“of
such
a
character.”
i'm
sorry.
it
says
that
the
term
“immoral”
shall
denote
a
motion
picture,
film,
or
a
part
thereof,
the
dominant
purpose
or
effect
of
which
is
erotic
or
pornographic
or
which
portrays
acts
of
sexual
immorality,
perversion,
or
lewdness,
or
which
expressly
or
impliedly
presents
such
acts
of
desirable,
acceptable,
or
proper
patterns
of
behavior.
now,
counsel
for
the
regents
in
the
court
below
conceded
that
the
words
“erotic”
or
“pornographic”
didn't
really
lend
much
to
the
meaning
or
to
the
precision
of
the
word
that
it
didn't
give
it
much
clarity.
but,
counsel
argued
that
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
with
these
words
which
are
just
as
vague
as
the
word
“immoral,”
but
we
are
to
limit
ourselves
to
the
consideration
of
the
following
language
“or
which
portrays
acts
of
sexual
immorality,”
etcetera,
“as
desirable,
acceptable,
or
proper.”
it
is
using
the
term
“sexual
immorality.”
it
says
all
we
have
to
do
now
is
find
--
is
to
--
is
to
show
that
a
particular
picture
portrays
an
act
of
sexual
immorality
as
a
proper
pattern
of
behavior,
and
that
is
very,
very
precise
and
clear
and
definite.
in
fact,
counsel
says
that
the
statute
couldn't
possibly
be
made
more
definite.
now,
how
are
you
going
to
put
--
how
are
you
going
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
picture
portrays
an
act
of
sexual
immorality
in
a
favorable
light
if
you
don't
know
what
sexual
immorality
means?
and,
this
court
had,
in
effect,
held
that
the
term
“sexual
immorality”
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
it
is
employing
exactly
the
same
term
that
this
court
disapproved.
i
might
call
attention,
too,
in
this
particular
--
mr.
ephraim
london
your
honor,
the
term
“obscene”
has
been
given
some
definiteness
by
the
court's
determinations.
that
is
not
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
true
of
the
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
of
the
word
“immorality”.
mr.
ephraim
london
your
honor,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
that
question
which
i
think
is
--
is
unrelated
to
the
question
of
the
vagueness
of
the
particular
term
“immorality”.
mr.
ephraim
london
because
the
--
the
determination
in
the
case
that
you
are
speaking
of
is
made
by
a
jury,
usually,
or
by
a
judge
in
proper
judicial
proceedings.
this
relates
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
licensing
statute
or
a
licensing
law
is
improper
because
of
the
fact
that
an
administrative
determination
is
made.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
--
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
as
a
--
if
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
--
mr.
ephraim
london
your
honor,
i
--
i
do
not,
for
a
moment,
question
the
right
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
--
to
make
provision
for
the
punishment
of
an
obscene
film
after
it
is
shown.
what
we
are
questioning
here
is
the
right
to
prevent
the
showing
altogether.
mr.
ephraim
london
and
--
and
i
make
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
there
are
other
differences.
i
--
i
would
like,
if
i
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
this
court
has
held
that
the
term
“obscene”
has
a
sufficiently
precise
meaning
so
that
the
term,
when
used
in
the
statute,
is
enforceable
in
a
penal
statute.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
think
a
difference
must
be
drawn,
again,
between
the
penal
statute
which
punishes
after
publication
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
--
i
think,
though,
that
that
question
must
be
--
must
be
bore
in
mind
in
considering
the
tribunal
before
which
or
the
tribunal
that
must
pass
on
the
question
for
the
simple
reason,
as
pointed
before,
that
the
tribunal
is
supposed
to
pass
--
is
supposed
to
--
to
enforce
the
community
mores,
not
the
personal
mores
of
the
--
of
the
person
enforcing
the
law
or
administering
the
law.
mr.
ephraim
london
precisely.
now,
in
connection
with
the
meaning
of
the
term
“immoral”,
there's
been
some
attempt
in
the
--
in
the
brief
of
the
regents
to
equate
“immorality”
with
“obscenity”
and
to
indicate
that
this
particular
picture
is
an
obscene
picture.
the
court
below
did
not
find
the
picture
obscene.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
majority
of
the
judges
in
the
court
below
held
that
it
was
not
an
obscene
picture
with
it
--
mr.
ephraim
london
precisely,
your
honor.
i
would
still
--
mr.
ephraim
london
precisely,
your
honor.
i
--
i
had
tried
to
--
to
say
that
and
i
hadn't
made
myself
clear,
but
i
certainly
believe
that
the
two
questions
are
--
are
that
there
are
two
separate
questions
despite
the
relationship
that
exists
between
them.
may
i
--may
i,
in
the
brief
time
that's
left,
speak
of
the
meaning
of
the
--
of
the
objection
to
the
use
of
the
word
“immorality,”
as
applied
in
this
particular
case,
on
the
ground
that
it
is
suppressing
an
idea.
what
the
regents,
in
effect,
say
is
that
this
picture
must
be
banned
because
it,
by
example,
approves
adultery.
now,
we
don't
concede
for
a
moment
that
the
picture
does
in
fact
approve
adultery
or
condone
it.
we
believe
that
the
entire
meaning
of
the
picture
has
been
missed
or
deliberately
ignored
by
the
regents.
mr.
ephraim
london
but
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
that
the
picture
relates,
your
honor,
to
the
--
to
the
dehumanizing
effects
of
industrialization
and
mechanization
in
modern
life.
i
think
this
is
the
real
meaning
of
the
picture,
the
real
meaning
of
the
book.
i
think,
its
made
quite
clear,
almost
everybody
in
the
picture
is
a
symbol,
a
symbol
of
mechanization
on
the
one
side,
or
a
symbol
of
the
human
man
who
is
unaffected
by
the
industrial
life
on
the
other.
i
have
tried
to
--
to
make
that
clear
in
my
brief.
but,
to
get
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
question
of
the
suppression
of
an
idea,
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
the
picture
did
say
“we
approve
adultery.
we
believe
in
it,”
it
may
not
be
suppressed
for
that
reason.one
has
a
perfect
right
to
state,
through
any
medium,
that
he
disapproves
of
marriage,
that
he
disapproves
of
marital
fidelity,
that
he
--
that
he
disapproves
of
our
entire
social
mores.
and,
the
constitution
protects
that
right.
the
constitution
protects
the
most
offensive
idea.
the
constitution
protects
the
statement,
for
example,
that
the
form
of
government
is
improper
or
that
the
constitution
is
not
--
is
a
document
that
should
be
ignored.
i
think
the
yates
and
spiezio
cases
had
made
it
quite
clear
that
no
matter
how
abhorrent
the
doctrine,
so
long
as
the
expression
is
confined,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
to
the
expression
of
an
idea
that
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
and
proper
to
make
the
statement
of
the
idea.
and,
may
i,
in
conclusion,
again,
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
broadest
question
even
though,
in
ordinary
circumstances,
it
tends
and
prefers
to
limit
itself
to
the
narrowest
question
that
is
presented.
i
think
that,
in
an
issue
relating
to
the
first
amendment,
the
court
may,
of
course,
consider
the
question
on
the
broadest
grounds.
it
has
stated
before
this--
the
--
the
question
has
come
before
the
court
a
number
of
times.
there
has
been
a
multiplicity
of
suits
and
there
will,
no
doubt,
be
as
great
a
number
before
a
sentence
if
the
court
does
not
make
its
position
clear
on
that
issue.
thank
you.
