it's
not
without
a
theory
that
this
court
ought
to
decide
the
broadest
possible
ground,
but
the
case
--
all
you
meant
is
that
this
permits
them,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
wouldn't
satisfy
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
difficulty
is
the
same.
it's
confusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
its
difficulty
for
the
lower
courts
to
decide
a
particular
case,
the
same
thing
as
such
chaotic
confusion,
that
we
ought
to
make
it
easier
for
them.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
conclusion
is
the
whole
scheme
must
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
my
errors
so
glaringly
exposed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
phrase
is
more
vague
or
less
guiding
than
obscene
in
the
state
--
in
your
general
obscenity
statute
in
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
has
it
been
given
except
as
whether
to
sell
certain
books
or
pamphlets
or
pictures
takes
the
risk
of
having
a
jury
or
judge
decide
that
it
is
obscene?
has
it
been
given
any
greater
definiteness
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
under
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
difference
you
make,
but
that
relates
not
to
the
criterion
for
determination
but
to
procedure
by
which
it
is
to
be
determined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
question
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
if
that's
the
only
distinction,
then
new
york
could
--
could
reenact.
supposed
this
statute
is
thrown
out
and
found
invalid,
to
meet
your
point,
the
new
york
legislature
when
--
may
be
called
in
a
special
session
and
amend
this
by
saying
such
a
determination
must
be
made
at
special
term
in
new
york,
and
that
would
take
care
of
your
objection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
two
questions
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
substantive
content
there
and
mode
for
determining
the
content.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
too,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
on
bearing
of
--
of
vagueness,
the
statute
doesn't
become
more
or
less
vague
regardless
of
one
tribunal
rather
than
another.
it
has
to
determine
the
content
of
the
“vague”
term.
so,
that
doesn't
preclude
the
fact
that
the
tribunals
--
the
nature
of
the
tribunal
and
the
mode
by
which
it
reaches
conclusion
may,
in
itself,
carry
vices
of
safeguard
that
may
make
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking,
on
the
question
of
vagueness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
sexual
immorality
is
less
vague
than
lewd,
obscene,
or
lascivious
in
the
federal
statute
or
a
comparable
new
york
term
and
comparable
terms
in
48
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
court
should
sustain
the
phrase
“sexual
immorality”
as
being
sufficiently
concrete,
the
same
thing
would
be
able
to
be
said
of
that
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
goes
to
the
question
of
prior
restraint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
go
to
the
question
of
the
relative
vagueness
of
content
of
terms
like
“obscenity”
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
against
sexual
immorality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
because
we
have
sustained
criminal
statutes
outlawing
obscenity
therefore,
tomorrow,
this
court
would
be
bound
by
those
decisions,
that
it
follows
precedence,
to
sustain
prior
restraint
of
books,
allegedly.
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
the
things
of
the
case
in
a
different
case
that
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it's
more
concededly
obscene,
you
would
still
be
here
making
the
argument
that
it
cannot
be
restrained
by
our
prior
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
different
questions.
prior
restraint
is
one
thing
and
whether
there
can
be
prior
restraint
or
either
consequences
for
obscenity
is
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
picture?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
brind,
may
i
ask
whether
differentiations
are
made
or
licenses
may
fall
into
licenses
for
mature
people,
whatever
the
line
is,
from
pictures
may
be
licensed
to
be
seen
only
by
adult,
pictures
could
be
seen
only
by
children
or
also
by
children,
anything
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
when
you
--
when
a
picture
is
licensed,
it
may
be
exhibited
in
any
picture
house
in
the
state,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
brind,
as
the
licensing
feature
as
such,
unrelated
to
grandeur,
obscenity,
or
immorality,
as
a
licensing
statute
as
such
would
attack
on
the
ground
that
if
it's
beyond
the
state's
power
to
inquire
those
pictures
to
be
licensed
just
as
it
would
be
under
state's
powers
to
inquire
the
publication
of
a
book
to
be
licensed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
come
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
--
has
the
court
passed
on
the
question
that
mr.
london
that
your
act
should
have
decided
that,
as
a
general
proposition,
good
pictures,
bad
pictures,
filthy
pictures,
benign
pictures,
educational
pictures,
edifying
pictures,
whatever
they
may
be,
neutral
pictures,
the
state
cannot
ask
or
cannot
exert
the
power
of
licensure,
has
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
they
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
--
they
didn't
say
“we
can
license
and
we're
not
going
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
picture.”
i
thought
judge
conway's
opinion
looked
a
lot
into
the
nature
of
the
picture
from
his
point
of
view,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
picture
were
as
pure
as
a
new
born
baby.
there
are
those
who
think
the
state
has
no
business
to
require
licensing.
then,
you
say
that
no
picture
can
be
shown
if
it's
the
most
exhilarating,
the
most
edifying,
and
the
most
morality-supporting,
no
picture
can
be
--
can
be
shown
without
being
licensed
thereto,
is
that
right?
is
that
law
of
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is,
has
anybody
challenged
the
power
of
new
york
to
require
such
licensing
for
an
innocuous
or
a
morally
improving
picture?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
did
those
cases
involve
the
abstract
question
or
did
they
involve
--
related
to
the
particular
picture,
before
the
court,
licensing
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
argument
was
made
but
was
it
necessary
for
the
court
to
restrict
its
decision
to
the
proposition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
good,
bad,
in
different
picture,
you
have
no
right
to
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
probably
tried
to
enjoin
them
if
they
--
wouldn't
you
try
if
a
--
if
a
movie
house
showed
a
picture
without
a
license,
you'd
have
power
to
go
and
get
an
injunction
against
the
showing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
will
test
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
not
been
--
that
--
that
question,
in
its
naked
aspect,
has
not
come
up
before
your
courts.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
in
judge
voorhis'
concurring
dissent,
he
not
only
agrees
with
judge
fuld
who
wrote
the
dissent,
but
he
suggest
it
to
be
a
remission
for
the
board
to
--
whether
it
would
be
a
decision
of
certain
so-called
offensive
features
of
this
movie.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
that
done
to
them
in
the
practical
administration
of
the
censorship
law
in
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
also
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
merely
the
--
not
only
to
put
a
different
label
on
the
ground
on
which
he
objected,
but
he
said,
“i
would
remit
the
matter
to
the
board
of
regents
to
consider
the
aspect
which
i
had
mentioned,
namely,
the
endeavor
to
file
to
exclude
obscenity”
and
he
would
exclude
those
--
he
would
cut
out
--
cut
out
those
portions
of
the
movie,
as
i
understood
him.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
leaving
enough
stands
so
that
people
would
get
whatever
lesson
they
could
get
from
it.
