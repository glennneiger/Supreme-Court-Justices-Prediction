without
any
question
relating
to
the
verbal
formulation
in
the
new
york
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
even,
in
other
words,
your
first
contention,
and
i
understand
it's
your
first
broad
contention,
even
if
the
new
york
statute
hadn't
provided
that
obscene
films
could
be
restrained
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
first
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
london,
the
question
isn't
quite
so
broad,
as
you
indicated,
is
it?
it
has
--
didn't
the
legislature
of
new
york,
in
section
122-a,
try
--
at
least
try,
perhaps
tried
its
best,
to
limit
and
further
define
the
adjective
“immoral”?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly.
my
only
suggestion
here,
at
least
my
suggestion,
is
this,
that
the
word
“immoral”
doesn't
mean
something
contrary
to
the
mores
of
society
with
respect,
say,
to
honesty
or
such
things
as
that.
it's
--
it's
at
least
confined
to
one
area
of
immoral
--
immorality,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
sexually
immoral?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
it's
made
more
specific
than
that,
isn't
it
--
isn't
it,
in
section
122-a?
justice
potter
stewart
i
appreciate
there
are
still
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
serious
questions,
but
the
question
is
a
little
more
narrow
than
you
indicated
by
this
question.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
brind,
how
--
how
large
a
body
is
the
board
of
regents?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
come
from
all
over
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
is
licensed,
it
doesn't
--
your
law
provides
that
nobody
can
be
prosecuted
for
exhibiting
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
if
it's
not
by
licensed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
your
provision
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
a
criminal
offense,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn't
there
a
very
great
difference
in
the
--
for
example,
this
--
this
film
is
banned
primarily,
as
i
read
chief
judge
conway's
opinion,
because
it
glorified
adultery.
it
made
adultery
attractive.
the
hero
and
heroine,
at
least
the
protagonists
in
this
picture,
are
guilty
of
adultery.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
for
that
reason,
rather
than
--
than
that
a
movie
was
basically
obscene,
that
this
--
this
picture
was
banned.
justice
potter
stewart
i
contrast
--
it's
certainly
doesn't
tax
the
imagination
to
think
of
a
possibility
of
a
movie
in
which
the
protagonists
were
pictured
as
a
man
and
wife,
maybe
even
the
actors
playing
the
parts
are
man
and
wife
and,
yet,
it's
quite
easy
to
imagine
movies
that
would
be
obscene
showing
very
moral
conduct
on
that
--
on
their
part,
but
of
a
--
but
of
an
intimate
nature.
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
make
a
difference
from
the
point
of
morality
if
they
are
married
or
if
this
is
extramarital
conduct,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
these
cases
arose,
did
they,
in
cases
where
a
license
was
denied?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
in
that
case,
they
would
necessarily
involve
the
specific
picture.
was
there
any
case,
and
this
might
--
i'm
trying
to
get
to
justice
frankfurter's
question,
was
there
any
case
in
which
a
person
just
said,
“i'm
not
going
to
bother
submitting
my
movie
to
you,
censors.
i'm
just
going
to
exhibit
it,”
and
it
--
and
it
was,
in
fact,
a
--
“because
i
don't
believe
in
licensing”?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
could
institute
criminal
proceeding,
couldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
the
merits
of
that
particular
film.
