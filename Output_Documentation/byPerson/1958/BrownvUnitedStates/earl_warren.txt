versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shapiro,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
had
there
been
anything
in
the
case
up
to
that
time
to
–
to
indicate
that
he
did
not
have
the
right
to
claim
the
privilege
in
the
other
–
in
the
other
grand
jury
investigations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
you
said
just
before
my
question?
i
understood
you
say
that
judge
had
said
something
about
he
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
he
had
not
answered
before
other
grand
juries.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
haven't.
you
have
until
the
red
light
comes
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
five
minute
--
that
light
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
quinn
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
i
notice
at
the
bottom
of
page
44
of
the
record
that
after
--
after
the
petitioner
had
raised
his
objection
that
the
question
--
the
answer
to
the
questions
would
tend
to
incriminate
him.
the
judge
insisted
that
he
answer
the
question,
will
these
answers
incriminate
you
and
that
was
objected
to
--
the
question
was,
“and
do
you
believe
that
these
answers
will
incriminate
you?”
mr.
shapiro,
i
object
to
that
question,
your
honor.”
the
court
overruled,
mr.
shapiro
exception
to
question,
do
you
believe
the
answers
to
these
questions
just
asked
you
would
incriminate
--
would
incriminate
you
in
anyway
and
the
same
objection,
same
ruling
and
then
--
then
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer.
now,
does
--
when
a
man
has
raised
his
constitutional
privilege
that
the
--
the
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
him,
does
the
judge
have
the
right
to
compel
him
to
answer
whether
it
will,
in
fact,
incriminate
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
isn't
the
--
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
the
privilege
that
he
claimed.
he
claimed
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
does
the
judge
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now
that
being
true
and
he
proceeded
immediately
to
--
to
convict
him
of
contempt
and
then
gave
him
15
months
in
jail
for
the
contempt.
how
many
months
might
he
had
given
him
for
refusing
to
answer
these
questions
that
i
just
read
to
you,
how
do
we
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
never
had
a
chance
to
defend
against
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
judge
proceeded
immediately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
--
it
was
a
question
of
the
privilege
and
whether
it
would
incriminate
him
or
whether
it
would
incriminate
him
or
not,
you
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he
had
to
answer.........
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
understood
you
to
say
just
few
minutes
ago
that
you
did
not
--
that
you
did
think
this
was
not
a
proper
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
must
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
--
mr.
shapiro
said,
“i
object
to
that
as
wholly
improper,
your
honor,”
a
violation
of
his
privilege.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
don't
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
doesn't
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
think
that's
a
question
of
form.
if
a
man
--
if
a
man
answers
not
once,
but
as
many
times
he
did
here
that
the
questions
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
and
the
judge
insists
on
the
--
on
an
answer,
will
it
incriminate
you,
i
don't
consider
that
a
matter
of
form,
i
think
that's
a
matter
of
substance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
they
have
a
different
procedure
on
april
8th
than
april
5th
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
he
know
he
was
going
to
make
the
adjudication
until
they
knew
what
the
defendant
was
going
to
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
be
objection
to
the
entire
procedure
carried
with
it
such
an
objection.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
such
an
objection
made
to
the
entire
procedure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
when
the
court
is
taking
shortcuts
over
the
procedure
that's
rather
precise
here,
is
the
burden
on
the
--
is
the
burden
on
the
--
the
petitioner
to
--
to
be
alert
to
whether
the
doors
are
closed
and
things
of
that
kind
or
--
or
is
that
an
obligation
of
the
--
of
the
court,
when
it
cuts
corners
on
procedures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
it
follow
the
language
of
the
section?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
i
mean
as
to
the
--
the
giving
him
notice
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
recollection
is
that
i
believe
it
was
last
term
you
--
in
one
case
we
had,
you
--
you
listed
all
of
the
federal
convictions
for
contempt
back
to
1790.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
up
to
the
last
few
years
there
was
nothing
there
that
exceeded
six
months,
and
eight
out
of
ten
of
them
at
least,
were
in
30
days
or
less.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
only
recently
that
they've
come
to
--
to
be
sentencing
people
to
15
months
and
two
years
and
three
years
and
five
years
for
--
for
contempt
in
the
summary
manner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
forgot
in
which
one
was
this
(voice

justice

warren

green
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
right.
you'll
finish
your
thought
in
this
--
in
this
matter,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
that
(voice

chief
justice
earl

in
the
yates
case,
yes.

you
very
much.
