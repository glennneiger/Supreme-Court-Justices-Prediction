did
the

judge
indicate
that
that
was
a
factor
consistent
to
the
count
of
fixing
the
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
i
gather,
the
judge
would
face
and
rather
indicated
that
that
argument
is

but
your
point
is
that
when
he
went
back
the
second
time
to

and
again
for
question,
before
the
grand
jury,
he
did
so
notwithstanding
the

ordered
him

to
answer
those
questions.
justice
william

therefore,
the
contentions

he
was
sent

you
have
a

on
which
attempt
when

justice
william

in

this

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
a
little
confused
though,
mr.
davis.
what
--
what's
the
contempt
to
which
he
was
convicted,
a
contempt
of
the
original
order
under
which
he
went
back
to
the
grand

room?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

in
disobedience
of
what
order
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
does
that
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
that
indicates
doesn't
it
that
the
conviction
was
had
upon
the
disobedience
before
judge
levet
are
not
upon
the
disobedience
of
the
order
which
send
him
back
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
when
we're
dealing
though
with
disobedience
of
the
court
order,
i'm
not
what
this
is
--
that
section
in
the
contempt
act
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
we're
--
when
we're
--
we
have
to
know,
do
we
not,
just
what
order
it
is
which
he
did
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
coming
right
back
then,
where
i
started.
just
what
order
is
it
that
the
government
says
he
disobeyed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
and
the
--
the
basic
order
was
the
one
that
send
him
back
to
the
grand
jury
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i'd

i'd
expect
you
to
say
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
procedures
under
42
(b),
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

could
answer
your
question
but
that's
never
refused
an
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it's
not
a
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
gather
then
when
he
was
put
on
the
stand,
(inaudible)
and
that's
because
there's
no
difference
had
he

(voice

response
to
the

did
that
go

at

was
that?
this

is
that

does
that
fall
on

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
know
what
kind
of
day
it
shows?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
that
what
differs,
as
i
recall
it,
mr.
davis,
is
that
what
you
argued
winston
or
not,
but
the
government
i
know
in
winston
argued
that
three
years
imposed
there
was
justified
because
of

green
(voice

and
here
you
suggest
that
the

is
the

isn't
there
a
six-month
provision
of
the
antitrust
laws

is
it
a

justice

there
is.

and
that's
on
contempt,
isn't
it?

is
there
any
analogy
to
be
drawn
from
that?
justice

all
right

justice
william
j.
brennan,

i'm
not
suggesting
it
does.
i'm
just
wondering
if
there's
an
analogy.
justice

well
have
we
any
sources
for
analogies
