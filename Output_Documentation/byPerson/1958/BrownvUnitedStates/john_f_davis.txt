mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
question
on
the
construction
of
the
motor
carrier
act
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
he
didn't.
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
when
he
was
brought
back
on
the
second
occasion,
the
--
the
court
--
the
proceedings
when
he
was
brought
back
were
that
the
court
had
the
minutes
read
so
that
it
could
tell
what
took
place
in
the
grand
jury
meeting
room
itself.
and
then
the
court
undertook
to
direct
the
questions
to
the
respond
–
to
the
petitioner
directly,
the
same
questions
which
he
had
refused
to
answer
and
he
again
refused
to
answer
them
to
the
court.
he
was
not
sworn
again.
there
was
that
interim
of
that
question
about
whether
he
had
already
been
sworn
and
it
was
assumed
that
he
had
and
the
questions
were
put
to
him
under
his
prior
oath.
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
self-incrimination
and
the
court
said
to
him
then,
“and
do
i
understand
that
if
i
return
you,
if
i'd
send
you
back
to
the
grand
jury
room,
you
will
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
“that
you
will
still
refuse
to
answer
there”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
that
particular
language
is
on
page
43
or
44
of
the
record.
his
answer
is,
yes,
which
means,
“yes,
i
would
refuse
to
answer
if
i
went
back.”
the
judge
asked
him
the
second
question
about
whether
he
believed
that
the
answers
would
incriminate
him
and
he
refused
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
john
f.
davis
after
that,
the
court
says,
“by
reason
of
your
refusal
to
answer
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court,
i'm
forced
to
act
upon
the
matter
and
i
will
hear
from
counsel”
and
he
heard
from
counsel
again
and
then
he
sentenced
him
for
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
on
this
question
of
construction
as
to
whether
congress
intended
the
immunity
provision
of
the
motor
carrier
act,
to
apply
to
proceedings
before
a
grand
jury,
it
would
be
strange
indeed,
if
congress
did
not
so
intend.
a
great
deal
of
the
history
of
the
immunity
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
indeed
that's
the
history
of
the
immunity
provisions
in
our
--
in
our
jurisprudence,
actually
occurred
before
grand
juries,
rather
than
in
administrative
proceedings.
counselman
against
hitchcock,
brown
against
walker,
hale
against
henkel,
all
of
these
cases
are
landmark
cases
in
this
immunity
provision
with
grand
jury
proceedings.
and
i
--
i
say
this
then,
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
in
view
of
this
history,
if
congress
in
making
applicable
to
the
motor
carrier
act,
these
same
provisions
which
had
previously
been
construed
by
this
court
in
connection
with
the
railroads
could
suddenly
have
withdrawn
the
protection
and
made
it
apply
only
in
case
of
commission
proceedings.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
yes,
indeed.
there's
another
--
another
feature
too
and
that
is
not
only
do
we
have
the
prior
history
with
respect
to
the
interstate
commerce
act,
but
we
have
the
subsequent
history
because
in
1940
and
again
in
1942,
congress
passed
additional
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
applying
it
first
to
motor
carriers
and
second
to
freight
forwarders.
in
both
of
these
cases,
they
again
incorporated
the
application
of
the
section
46,
the
immunity
provision
applying
the
railroads.
and
in
this
--
these
cases,
there's
never
been
any
question
that
it
applies
to
grand
juries,
as
well
as
to
administrative
proceedings.
and
so
i
say
that
it's
a
--
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
if
congress
had
carved
out
this
particular
section
of
the
act
and
made
only
the
administrative
proceedings
subject
to
the
immunity
provisions.
certainly,
it
doesn't
appear
from
the
language
of
this
section.
the
language
of
this
section
is,
“any
person
subpoenaed
or
testifying
in
connection
with
any
matter
under
investigation
shall
have
the
same
immunities
as
those
any
matter
arose
under
chapter
1
of
the
act.
the
--
the
only
reason
--
the
only
reason
that
it
can
be
implied
if
this
is
limited
is
because
it
is
connected
in
the
same
section.
indeed,
it's
in
the
same
sentence
with
this
provision
with
respect
to
the
power
of
the
commission
to
conduct
investigations.
and
petitioner
would
have
us
believe
that
since
the
first
part
of
this
section
deals
solely
with
--
with
commission
investigations,
the
second
part
must
to
do
so
also.
well,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
the
first
part
of
this
section
deals
with
investigations
by
the
commission
because
it's
necessary
to
give
that
power
specifically
to
the
commission
in
connection
with
motor
carriers.
it
wouldn't
have
it,
unless
it
give
--
gave
it.
so,
it
incorporated
by
reference
section
12
of
the
--
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
but
section
--
the
second
part
of
the
section
is
not
necessarily
of
--
if
there's
no
reason
why
it
should
be
limited
to
the
--
to
the
investigative
proceedings
only
and
congress
in
nowise
implied
that
it
should
be.
i
can
think
of
only
one
possible
excuse
for
construing
this
section
in
the
limited
way
that
petitioner
suggest.
and
that
is
on
the
mistaken
thought
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute
since
there
can
be
a
possibility
of
construing
it,
one
of
two
ways,
we
must
construe
it
in
a
way
which
will
give
protection
to
a
defendant.
and
that's
a
--
that's
a
valid
argument
in
connection
with
criminal
statutes.
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
particular
statute
is
not
a
statute
establishing
a
crime,
defining
a
crime.
it's
a
statute
defining
immunity.
and
this
question
of
interpretation
might
well
come
before
the
court
in
a
different
context.
it
might
come
up
in
the
case
of
a
criminal
prosecution
against
an
individual
who
claimed
that
he
had
obtained
immunity
on
the
ground
that
he
had
testified
before
a
grand
jury.
and
in
that
case,
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
it
would
be
to
the
advantage
of
that
defendant,
if
we
construed
the
statute
so
that
he
was
given
immunity
on
the
basis
of
his
--
of
his
testimony
before
a
grand
jury.
yet
the
question
of
construction
is
the
same
and
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
there
is
no
really
strict
interpretation,
it's
a
question
of
rather
determining
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
this
particular
provision.
it
seems
fair
to
us,
at
least,
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
the
immunity
provisions
which
it
had
found
satisfactory
from
the
comparable
provisions
of
dealing
with
railroads
and
in
the
way
which
this
court
has
construed
them.
now,
the
--
the
second
question
of
construction
deals
with
whether
or
not,
the
immunity
granted
by
this
section
is
sufficient
so
as
to
make
it
unnecessary,
make
it
impossible
for
the
petitioner
to
claim
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
too
seems
to
be
concluded
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
what
was
--
the
immunity
which
is
given
in
this
case,
is
the
very
immunity
which
was
passed
upon
by
this
court
in
brown
against
walker
in
dealing
with
the
immunity
granted
to
individuals
testifying
with
respect
to
the
first
portion
of
the
act.
and
in
brown
against
walker,
this
court,
after
very
careful
consideration,
found
that
the
immunity
was
coextensive
with
the
liability
and
as
--
as
recently
as
in
1955,
this
court
has
reaffirmed
that
--
that
position
in
ullman
against
the
united
states.
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
immunity
is
not
complete
because
of
the
fact
that
the
section
begins
with
the
words,
“so
far
as
maybe
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
this
chapter.”
these
words,
however,
in
that
context,
clearly
state
--
clearly
mean
the
circumstances
under
which
the
commission
may
conduct
investigations.
the
commission
itself
may
conduct
administrative
proceedings.
if
the
petitioner
is
right
that
these
words
must
be
read
for
the
entire
section,
this
is
really
no
more
than
a
repetition
of
his
first
argument
that
we're
dealing
only
with
--
with
commission
--
with
proceedings
before
the
commission
and
therefore,
we
don't
need
to
reach
this
argument
here.
he's
proved
his
--
he's
proved
his
first
case
that
--
that
it
applies
--
that
does
not
apply
to
grand
jury
proceedings.
therefore,
this
really
adds
nothing
to
his
prior
argument.
now,
with
respect
to
procedure,
the
petitioner
has
raised
three
questions.
the
first
question
is
whether
it
was
proper
for
this
court
to
proceed
under
rule
42
(a)
of
the
rules
for
criminal
procedure,
for
a
contempt
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
rather
than
to
proceed
on
notice
under
section
42
(b).
and
the
second
question
on
procedure
was
--
is
whether
the
petitioner
was
unlawfully
required
to
testify
against
himself
when
he
was
put
on
the
stand
and
ask
questions.
and
his
third
question
is
whether
he
was
deprived
the
due
process
by
reason
of
the
court's
action
in
the
clearing
the
court
at
the
commencement
of
the
proceeding
and
not
thereafter,
inviting
the
public
back
in.
but
with
that,
it
attacked
first
the
question
of
whether
this
procedure
was
proper
under
section
--
under
rule
42
(a)
of
the
rules
for
criminal
procedure.
rule
42
(a)
provides
that
when
a
contempt
is
committed
in
the
very
presence,
in
the
sight
of
the
--
of
the
court,
the
court
may
act
summarily
in
dealing
with
that
contempt.
section
22
(b)
deals
with
the
situations
where
a
contempt
occurs
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
court
and
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
learn
from
some
other
source
what
went
on.
in
this
particular
situation,
i
think
it
is
true
that
there
was
contempt
of
court,
when
the
petitioner
refused
in
the
grand
jury
room
to
answer
questions
which
the
court
had
ordered
him
to
answer.
and
i
think
that
that
was
a
contempt
which
was
out
of
the
presence
of
the
court
and
that
one
could
have
proceeded
therefore,
under
section
42
(b)
on
notice
and
would
have
had
to,
if
you
had
proceeded
on
that
contempt.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
it
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
disobedience
of
the
court's
order,
but
disobedience
of
the
court's
order
outside
of
its
presence.
instead
of
proceeding
under
42
(b),
this
petitioner
was
brought
back
to
the
court
and
these
same
questions
were
asked
and
he
refused
to
answer
them
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
he
further
said
that
he
would
not
answer
them,
if
he
were
returned
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
under
the
yates
case
--
under
the
costello
case,
this
is
one
continuing
refusal
to
answer
these
questions,
culminating
in
the
refusal
before
the
court.
i
think
it
was
actually
completed,
could
have
been
prosecuted
on
what
happened
in
the
grand
jury.
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
because
they
didn't
--
the
--
neither
the
united
states
attorney,
nor
the
judge
decided
to
charge
him
with
contempt
for
that
proceeding.
they
said,
they
were
really
anxious,
of
course,
in
this
case
to
get
the
answers
to
these
questions.
they
were
still
trying
to
persuade
this
man
to
answer
these
questions
which
were
important.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it's
not
a
new
and
independent
order,
i
think
it's
really
a
repetition
of
the
first
order.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
is
right.
it
was
restated,
this
counsel
argued
again,
but
there
was
no
new
order,
they
were
the
same
questions
in
the
same
--
in
the
same
termination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
he
did.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
he
would
have
purged
himself.
i
think
they
would
be
--
we
would
--
it
be
impossible
then
to
say
when
you
maybe
all
right
now,
but
you
committed
a
contempt
awhile
ago.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
his
contempt
was
the
refusal
to
answer
these
particular
questions
which
were
properly
put.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
--
well,
the
order
isn't
defined
in
--
in
so
many
terms
--
in
--
in
so
many
words.
it's
--
the
terms
of
the
certificate
are
--
i
put
the
same
questions
which
he
refused
to
answer
after
having
been
--
been
directed
to
do
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they're
from
page
5
of
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
is
so
that
the
actual
final
act
of
disobedience
for
which
he
was
punished
and
say
gave
them
the
further
opportunity
to
answer
was
before
judge
levet.
but
i
--
i
do
not
think
that
there
are
two
acts
of
contempt.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
multiply
acts
of
contempt
by
asking
him
questions
in
the
grand
jury
and
having
him
refuse
to
answer,
bringing
him
before
the
court
and
answering
--
asking
the
same
questions
and
having
him
refuse
to
answer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
you
have
to
find
him
that
--
you
have
to
find
in
the
record
that
he
was
--
that
the
court
asked
upon
his
claim
of
privilege
and
turned
it
down
and
ordered
him
to
answer
these
questions,
which
he
did
twice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
the
final
order
was
the
order
when
he
was
brought
back
the
second
time
and
certainly,
there
was
a
disobedience
of
that
order.
i
think
that
was
a
mere
repetition
of
a
prior
order.
i
don't
think
it
was
really
two
orders
of
the
court.
i
think
that
the
court
made
one
decision
and
reaffirmed
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
when
the
court
determined
that
he
had
no
--
no
privilege
against
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
everything
you've
said
is
true,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
the
certificate
recites
both
refusals.
in
the
first
paragraph,
it's
the
refusal
when
he
went
back
the
first
time
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
second
paragraph,
when
he
refused
the
second
time
and
then
he
says
accordingly,
pursuant
to
rule
42
(a),
why
we
find
him
in
contempt.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
a
court
cannot
for
the
purpose
of
summary
--
of
summary
contempt,
transform
a
42
(b)
case
into
a
42
(a).
i
don't
think
that
just
in
order
to
--
to
get
a
man
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
to
get
a
summary
proceeding
that
he
can
go
through
an
artificial
business
of
bringing
him
before
him
and
--
and
having
him
repeat
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
if
we
had
anything
like
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
why?
we
wouldn't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
we
wouldn't
argue
it.
but
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
here
is
the
continuing
effort
by
the
united
states
attorney
and
by
the
court
to
get
this
man
to
answer
these
questions
which
were
essential
to
this
investigation.
and
he
--
he
gave
them
every
opportunity
and
he
included,
if
i
may
say
so,
quite
properly,
whatever
dignity
the
court
had
in
trying
to
persuade
this
man
to
answer
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
--
i
think
not,
as
long
as
--
as
this
court
has
the
record
before
them
and
conceive
what
did
occur.
i
think
that
if
anyone
--
if
--
if
that
attempt
were
made,
it
would
appear
from
the
record
what
was
going
on.
mr.
john
f.
davis
excuse
me?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
followed
in
the
second
circuit
particularly.
i'm
not
sure
that
how
many
of
the
other
circuits
have
the
judge,
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury,
ask
the
questions.
now,
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
i
don't
think,
for
example,
that
the
judge
asked
the
--
these
questions
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury.
i
think
he
directs
the
witness
to
go
back
to
the
grand
jury
to
answer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
not
necessarily.
if
--
he
can
also
say
as
this
judge
and
if
i
send
you
back,
will
you
answer
and
if
he
says,
i
won't
go
back
or
i
won't
answer
for
them,
why
then
the
refusal
takes
place
in
the
presence
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
a
--
it
is.
it's
--
at
least
in
the
anticipation
of
saying,
“i
am
going
to
refuse
your
order”.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
that
is
--
that
maybe
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
you
mean
the
congressional
cases
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
a
part
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
not
flower,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
quinn,
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
the
--
his
statement
that
i
will
not
go
back,
shows
that
this
is
final
or
that
i
will
not
answer,
if
i
go
back.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
that's
the
reason
that
he
asked
the
--
asked
the
--
the
man
whether
he
will
answer
when
he
goes
back.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it's
precisely
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
--
that's
what
they
intend
to
do.
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
purpose.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
what
the
judge
said.
that's
why
he
said
and
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that
is
not
--
we
don't
have
to
imply
that.
that's
what
the
judge
says.
that's
why
he
said
it
wasn't
necessary
to
affirm.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
then
we
come
to
the
--
the
great
issue
of
secrecy.
i
--
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
judge
couldn't
have
gone
into
the
grand
jury
room
and
have
the
contempt
occur
and
then
in
the
secrecy
of
a
grand
jury
room,
convicted
the
man
of
contempt.
and
i
think
that's
–
he
has
to
do
that
out
in
the
open
court
and
our
question
on
secrecy
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not,
the
fact
that
the
court
had
been
cleared
from
the
beginning
of
these
proceedings
and
the
fact
that
the
doors
weren't
formally
thrown
over,
whether
that
makes
this
a
proceeding
where
he
was
the
--
of
(inaudible)
chamber
of
secret
proceedings
and
in
violation
of
his
rights
to
a
public
trial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
right.
that's
--
that's
what
we
conceive
that
this
situation
is
the
equivalent
of
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
has
the
right
to
explore
his
--
his
good
faith
in
making
the
claim
then
do
you
really
believe,
as
this
man,
do
you
really
believe
that
the
answer
to
these
questions
will
incriminate
you
in
anyway?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
have
to
tell
--
i
have
to
tell
this
right.
i
--
i
think
that
the
question
should
properly
be
asked.
do
you
believe
that
it
will
tend
to
incriminate?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
had
this
--
he
has
--
he
has
chance
to
defend
in
what
--
in
what
followed
after
whether
or
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
whether
or
not
--
no,
the
judge
then
--
there
was
colloquy
and
before
the
--
before
the
adjudication,
he
had
the
--
the
same
counsel
to
defend
against
it
as
he
held
against
any
of
the
--
any
of
the
rest
of
the
contempt
charge.
but
may
i
say
this,
that
the
judge
did
not
actually
certify
this
as
one
of
the
acts
of
contempt
for
which
he
was
imposing
the
punishment.
the
certificate
limits
the
contempt
to
the
--
to
the
other
questions.
i
--
i
repeat
that
i
believe
this
is
a
proper
question
for
the
judge
to
revise.
if
we
go
back
to
the
early
questions
of
contempt
in
the
ehrenberg
case,
we
find
that
--
that's
what
the
judge
is
trying
to
do.
he's
trying
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
claim
of
privilege
is
made
in
good
faith
or
whether
(inaudible)
because
the
man
is
afraid
that
the
gangsters
would
get
him
or
something
else,
which
is
not
a
proper
basis
for
making
the
claim.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that's
one
question
which
was
raised,
but
that
may
not
be
the
only
question
that
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
this
is
a
proper
question
except
that
it
didn't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
cannot
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
phrase
because
it
should
have
said,
would
tend
to
incriminate
you
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
a
difference
and
i
--
and
in
that
--
in
that
sense,
if
--
if
objections
were
made
to
the
--
to
the
form
of
this
question,
if
it
wasn't
meant
to
carry
the
thought
i
--
in
good
faith
in
making
your
claim,
which
i
think
is
what
the
judge
meant.
are
you
in
good
faith
in
making
this
claim
that
you
are
making
by
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
i
--
i
think
that
doesn't
raise
this
question
of
whether
it
would
tend
to
incriminate
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
or
would
incriminate
you.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
--
it
may,
but
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
pinpointed
of
course
that
--
i
don't
think
the
court
or
anybody
else
in
this
setting
has
realized
that
any
objection
was
being
raised
to
the
language
that
the
judge
used
in
--
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
claim.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
is
--
it
is
if
the
--
if
the
question
is
taken
literally.
this
--
this
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that
and
it
is
hard
--
it's
hardened
on
a
cold
record
to
know
exactly
what
is
in
the
minds
of
the
target.
certainly,
mr.
shapiro
did
not
at
that
time,
raise
any
objection
to
this
--
to
this
form
in
which
the
--
just
leaving
out
the
words,
tend
to
incriminate
you,
and
in
fact,
when
it
come
--
the
chief
justice
called
to
my
attention,
in
fact,
that
he
says
incriminate
you
instead
of
tend
to
incriminate
you,
i
have
not
even
been
conscious
that
they
--
there
had
been
phraseology
anew.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
that
is
so,
your
honor,
and
if
that
was
the
objection
and
properly
whether
he
should've
realized
it,
then
this
was
an
improper
question
and
he
--
and
the
objection
was
properly
taken.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
may
point
out,
as
i've
pointed
out
in
the
beginning,
that
the
judge
did
not
place
any
of
his
sentence
of
contempt
on
the
basis
of
this
question,
he
placed
it
entirely
on
the
refusal
to
answer
the
other
question.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
i
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
would
be
in
great
trouble
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
no
question
about
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
that
would
--
we've
had
just
the
hoffman
case,
which
was
--
that
i
had
the
misfortune
(inaudible)
have
some
years
ago
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
well,
i
--
i
want
to
go
to
the
secrecy
point
and
i
also
want
to
go
to
the
question
of
whether
it
was
--
whether
he
was
compelled
to
testify
against
himself.
the
secrecy
point
is
--
is
an
important
one
in
this
respect
only.
this
court
neither
--
neither
the
department
of
justice
nor
this
court
should
give
any
competence
to
the
thought
that
in
a
conviction
for
contempt
that
it
can
be
done
behind
closed
doors,
that
is
not
a
proper
way
to
try
contempt.
it
should
be
done
in
open
court
and
the
man
had
a
right
to
have
it
done
in
open
court.
now,
the
question
is
how
did
that
apply
to
the
facts
of
these
cases
and
this
case?
and
as
we
see
this
case,
this
complaint
is
not
because
it
was
actually
done
in
secret,
but
it's
--
again
it's
the
case
of
careful
lawyers
going
over
a
--
a
record
and
finding
what
maybe
a
--
an
error
on
appeal.
when
the
--
when
the
first
of
these
proceedings
was
started
on
--
on
bringing
before
the
judge,
the
courtroom
was
clear
that
because
they
were
going
to
ask
the
questions
over
again.
and
when
the
court
came
around,
came
to
the
question
of
actually
passing
upon
the
contempt,
there
was
no
change
--
there
was
no
affirmative
order
inviting
people
in.
however,
this
was
a
public
courtroom.
this
is
in
a
public
--
in
the
criminal
section
of
the
--
of
the
district
court
in
new
york
and
it
is
ordinarily
open
to
the
public,
unless
the
public
is
excluded
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
in
fact
that
the
public
was
excluded.
in
fact,
the
most
important
person
present
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view
was
his
own
counsel,
who,
of
course,
is
not
permitted
in
--
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
his
own
counsel
is
present
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
he
--
well,
he
was
present
before
the
--
in
the
courtroom
and
before
the
judge,
not
on
the
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
gives
him
an
(inaudible).
before
the
--
before
the
judge,
he
was
present
in
the
courtroom.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
record,
you'll
find
that
there
was
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
was
april
5th.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
not
on
april
8th
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
nothing
on
april
8th.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
was
a
different
procedure
going
on
when
--
when
it
came
down
to
the
question
of
making
the
finding
--
making
the
adjudication
at
the
contempt.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
when
the
court
said,
“very
well,
by
reason
of
your
refusal
to
answer
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court,
i'm
forced
to
act
upon
this
matter.
this
would
be
in
justice
harlan's
comparable
situation
the
time
when
the
court,
in
effect,
returned
to
his
courtroom
and
began
and
went
to
the
question
of
adjudication
on
contempt.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it
shows
this
is
early
in
the
afternoon.
it
was
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
when
the
proceeding
started.
he
was
--
he
reported
to
the
grand
jury
at
about
quarter-of-three
and
this
is
about
a
quarter
pass
three,
i
believe,
3
o'clock
or
--
or
3:15.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
from
the
first
place,
it
was
the
duty
of
--
of
defendant's
counsel
to
raise
this
question
before
the
judge
rather
than
to,
in
effect,
save
an
error
in
order
to
reverse
on
appeal.
i
think
that
if
there's
been
anything
that's
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
then
we'd
have
a
clearest
of
the
clear
issues.
counsel
did
not
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
raised
no
objection.
if
--
if
it
turned
out
--
if
the
evidence
was
that
people
were
actually
excluded
from
the
courtroom
during
this
period,
i
think
that
that
was
an
improper
proceeding
and
he
was
denied
due
process.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
would
not
think
that
it
would
be
in
the
--
in
the
--
but
to
the
benefit
of
orderly
procedure
to
permit
a
general
exception
like
that
to
carry
this
particular
--
to
carry
this
particular
objection.
it
--
it
doesn't
give
enough
protection.
it
allows
--
it
allows
trial
counsel
to
lull
the
court
along
in
error
in
order
to
get
reversal
up
above,
if
it
doesn't
win
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
--
if
the
court
were
cutting
corners
on
procedure,
why,
we
would
have
a
different
--
we
would
have
a
different
question
here,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh!
i
think
the
court
followed
them.
yes,
i
think
the
court
followed
that.
you
mean
in
this
--
in
this
question
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
tend
to
incriminate?
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh!
no.
he
wasn't
proceeding
under
--
under
the
42
(b).
he
was
following
the
language
of
42
(a)
as
i
think
that
he
was
entitled
to
that.
the
--
there's
also
the
allegation
made
and
this
was
objected
to
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
proceeding,
there
was
the
allegation
that
was
improper
to
put
this
man
on
the
stand
and
ask
him
these
questions
in
--
for
the
judge
to
do
so.
it
said
that
he
was
being
asked
to
testify
against
himself.
and
this,
i
think,
also
--
the
answer
to
this,
i
think,
also
depends
upon
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
these
proceedings.
if
we
are
right
that
this
was
a
proceeding
in
which
the
court
was
still
attempting
to
get
this
witness
to
answer
these
questions
which
would
give
him
immunity,
then
he
was
not
being
asked
to
testify
against
himself.
he
was
merely
being
asked
to
do
the
kind
of
act
that
citizens
are
required
to
do
in
order
to
carry
out
the
procedure
to
justice,
namely,
to
testify.
now,
when
he
refused
to
testify,
to
be
sure
that
redounds
to
his
--
to
his
detriment,
but
that
is
so
in
--
in
any
case
where
a
witness
is
called
to
testify
and
--
and
defies
the
court
or
--
or
purges
himself.
in
that
sense,
of
course,
what
he
--
what
he
says
is
against
himself,
but
this
is
not
what
historically
we
think
of
as
being
--
being
called
upon
to
testify
against
oneself
and
i
come
finally
to
the
question
of
the
--
of
its
sentence.
the
court
sentenced
this
man
to
15
months
and
i'm
--
in
connection
with
whether
or
not,
this
involved
sentencing
him
for
claiming
his
privilege
properly
before
the
other
grand
juries,
the
court
itself,
said
on
page
49
that
he
wasn't
concerned
with
that.
he
was
concerned
only
with
the
--
with
the
current
preceding,
so
that
we
do
have
a
situation
of
the
15-month
penalty
for
this
--
this
particular
contempt
of
the
court.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
important
that
the
motor
carrier
act
has
lesser
penalty
for
violations
of
that
act.
this
is
not
an
attempt
by
indirection
to
punish
this
man
for
a
violation
of
the
motor
carrier
act.
i
do
not
know
that
--
i
do
not
know
that
the
united
states
attorney
had
any
belief
that
this
man
had
in
any
way,
violated
the
motor
carrier
act.
they
were
making
investigation
of
racketeering
in
connection
with
the
teamsters
union
and
the
garment
industry.
they
were
trying
to
find
out
the
background
of
the
blinding
of
victor
riesel.
and
in
connection
with
that,
this
man
had
had
of
--
the
united
states
attorney
thought
that
he
had
had
close
relationships,
business
relationships
with
people
that
were
involved
in
those
proceedings
and
they
were
trying
to
get
information
from
him.
they
weren't
trying
to
pin
a
crime
on
him.
so
the
relationship
between
the
punishment
for
contempt
and
the
punishment
for
the
crimes
involved
in
the
motor
--
motor
vehicle
act,
really
have
no
--
no
relation
to
this
case.
here,
he
--
it
was
defiance
of
the
court
in
a
serious
and
important
grand
jury
investigation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
the
green
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that
--
that
is
right,
but
we
argued
that
there
was
a
five-year
penalty.
i
didn't
argue
the
case,
but
there
was
a
five-year
penalty
for
--
which
was
actually
enacted
after
mr.
green
refused
to
surrender.
but
one
of
the
arguments
presented
to
this
court
that
this
is
an
indication
that
at
least
the
congress,
five
years
didn't
seem
to
be
an
extreme
punishment
for
the
offense
that
green
did
in
defiance
of
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
here,
i
suggest
that
in
that
case,
the
contempt
of
court
and
the
crime
were
of
comparable
acts.
the
--
the
offenses
in
one
case,
is
they're
--
they're
looked
at
from
a
different
angle.
in
one
case,
it's
an
offense
to
the
court
and
the
other
is
an
offense
to
the
justice
--
to
congress.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
comparable
relationship
because
we're
not
--
no
one
--
no
one
is
accusing
brown
and
as
far
as
i
know
and
no
one
--
no
one
believed
that
brown
was
guilty
of
any
violation
of
the
motor
vehicle
provision
for
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
if
the
year
--
if
in
case
you
are
left
the
provision
in
case
that's
a
--
it
--
it
is
six
months,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
in
connection
--
it
is
a
--
if
it
is
a
crime
which
is
punishable
by
statute
and
if
the
united
states
is
not
bringing
the
proceeding,
then
there
is
a
six
months
punishment
for
contempt.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
contempt,
the
contempt
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
commission.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
because
it
says
--
and
that
was
the
problem
which
arose
in
green
also,
whether
you
could
do
more
than
here.
it
says
in
other
cases,
this
is
a
case
that's
clearly
doesn't
come
within
or
wouldn't
come
within
that
six
months
provision.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
then
the
statute
says,
the
statute
itself,
the
same
one
that
provides
the
six-month
provision
said,
in
other
cases
then
it
shall
be
according
to
the
custom
usage
and
that
--
and
that
may
not
be
exactly,
there's
something
like
a
custom
usage
and
this
court,
in
determining
--
and
the
eyewitness
made
to
be
a
custom
usage
was
less
than
a
year.
it
was
a
year
or
less
and
that
was
the
--
argued
to
the
--
to
the
court
and
the
court
said
that
in
that
case,
it's
really
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
--
it's
really
a
question.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not,
this
judge
abused
its
discretion
and
you'll
look
at
this
case
from
the
other
cases
of
contempt,
you'll
look
at
the
circumstances
and
you
--
anyone
has
to
make
a
determination,
if
this
to
--
to
(inaudible)
closer
within
36
months.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
then
you'll
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
have
to
look
and
--
and
you'd
say,
well,
up
to
this
time,
most
that's
been
given
for
contempt
for
refusing
to
answer
is
--
is
18
months.
this
is
quite
as
much
as
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
have
cited
in
our
--
in
our
brief
situation,
most
of
them
--
most
contempt
of
--
are
not
as
--
as
punished
us
seriously
at
this,
but
there
have
been
contempt
of
court
which
has
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
as
i
say,
there
isn't
any
--
any
fixed
pattern.
there
are
cases
where
it
is
gone
above
us.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
more
of
them
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
state
case
is
certainly,
because
generally
speaking
the
state
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
made
plea
to
this
60
days
or
90
days
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
real
--
and
people
say
that
this
is
so
severe.
what
i
suggest
that
when
you
look
at
the
background
of
this
case,
that
this
is
--
this
is
not
a
--
an
unreasonable
or
a
severe
penalty
for
refusing
to
come
forward
with
useful
information
in
this
--
in
this
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
--
it
is
true
that
we
--
that
those
were
listed.
i
think
that's
what
the
brief
in
the
green.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it's
green
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
now,
a
(inaudible)
study
was
made
of
the
history
of
the
contempt
of
the
sentences
that
were
given,
because
the
same
question
that
is
raised
here
was
raised
in
the
green
case
where
there
was
the
three-year
sentence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
misinformed
you
when
i
took
the
list
of
the
cases
which
are
green
cases,
our
brief
--
our
brief
in
the
yates
case.
