did

(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
the
most
appropriate
objection
he
got
to
make.
why
--
why
isn't
it
not
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
two
questions,
do
you
believe
that
this
would
incriminate
you
to
say
that's
the
same
as
asking,
are
you
really
guilty
of
this?
that's
what
it
is,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
what
way
could
the
defendant
take
it
except
literally?
he
refused
to
answer
them
after
objection
has
been
made
that
those
questions
were
a
violation
of
the
privilege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
are
right,
may
i
ask
you
this,
it
maybe
that
you
have
a
perfectly
good
answer,
i'm
not
sure
because
if
you
are
right
and
there
was
complete
immunity
that
he's
confessing
any
crime
at
all,
that
has
brought
[laughs]
all
the
crimes
after
he
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
present
at
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
doors
were
shut,
he
didn't
let
anybody
in,
except
the
counsel
at
the
time
he
actually
sentenced
him
for
contempt
and
declared
him
guilty,
what
would
you
say
then?
it's
what
the
record
--
one
should
think
the
record
showed
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
ahead
and
read
the
next.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
state
open
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
that
stated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
it
stated
that
he
be
summoned
or
furnished
with
a
notice
in
open
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
furnish
him
in
an
open
court,
do
you?
