mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
certiorari
to
review
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
under
rule
42
(a)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
refusing
to
answer
certain
questions
before
a
judge
and
grand
jury.
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
15
months
and
the
matter
and
was
allowed
on
bail
by
the
circuit
--
by
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
one,
whether
under
section
305
(d)
of
the
motor
carrier's
act,
the
petitioner
obtained
immunity
if
he
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
two;
whether
the
immunity,
if
it
existed,
was
coextensive
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
three,
whether
the
procedure
followed
here,
resulting
in
his
conviction
of
criminal
contempt
under
rule
42
(a)
was
valid.
fourth,
whether
the
sentence
of
15
months
was
unreasonable
and
abuse
of
judicial
discretion
and
cruel
an
unusual
punishment.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes
judge
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
eight
days
rather,
he
served
eight
days
before
united
states
court
of
appeals
released
him
on
bail.
the
petitioner
is
associated
with
a
garment,
dress
garment
manufacturing
company
in
new
york
city,
known
as
young
tempo
inc.
he's
also
associated
with
another
dress
manufacturing
company
known
as
acme
dress
company
which
is
located
in
midvale,
new
jersey.
there
is
another
company
known
as
t
&
r
cutting
or
t
&
r
trucking
company,
i
shall
refer
to
it
as
t
&
r
trucking,
which
transports
materials
and
dresses
to
and
from
young
tempo
in
new
york
and
to
in
from
acme
dress
company
in
new
jersey.
now,
this
company
is
nominally
owned
by
a
man
named
theodore
reish
or
teddy
ray.
the
government's
information
is,
as
the
record
shows,
that
the
real
owner
of
t
&
r
trucking
is
one
john
dioguardi
or
johnny
dio,
a
notorious
person
in
new
york
state
or
new
york
city.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner,
for
a
number
of
times,
had
appeared
before
two
grand
juries
in
the
southern
district
pursuant
to
subpoena.
the
first
appearance
was
in
connection
with
the
location
of
teddy
ray
in
the
(inaudible)
obstruction
of
justice
case.
the
other
appearances,
which
we
computed
to
be
about
10
or
11
times,
were
in
connection
with
the
general
rakecteering
investigation
then
going
on
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
particularly
directed
to
the
garment
trucking
industry.
at
those
times,
the
petitioner
when
appeared,
mainly
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
although
he
did
give
some
testimony.
in
march
of
1957,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
had
been
handling
this
matter
from
the
inception
called
petitioner's
counsel,
that
is
myself,
to
his
office
in
the
courthouse
and
informed
me
that
they
had
decided
to
institute
an
investigation
under
the
motor
carrier's
act
and
that
under
section
305
(d)
and
section
46
of
the
original
interstate
commerce
act,
immunity
would
apply
and
that
therefore,
petitioner
would
not
have
his
privilege
and
refuse
--
and
could
not
refuse
to
testify.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no
sir.
the
petitioner
was
served
with
the
subpoena
which
called
upon
him
to
appear
personally
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
appeared
on
april
5th,
1957
accompanied
by
counsel,
and
throughout
the
proceedings
i
may
say
counsel
remained
in
the
anteroom
with
the
grand
jury
and
the
petitioner
was
permitted
to
consult
with
counsel
during
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
the
petitioner
was
asked,
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings
on
april
5th,
a
number
of
questions
which
appeared
on
page
6
of
petitioners
brief
here,
all
of
which
seriatum
and
together
i
would
say,
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
he
also
refused
to
answer
these
questions
after
he
had
consulted
with
counsel.
the
grand
jury
then
directed
him
to
--
down
to
room
318,
the
criminal
part
of
the
southern
district,
where
judge
levet
was
presiding
and
there
the
grand
jury
was
present
along
with
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
petitioner
and
his
counsel
and
judge
levet
of
course.
the
judge
was
adviced
that
the
proceedings
then
to
be
had
were
the
efforts
of
the
grand
jury
to
secure
the
aid
and
assistance
of
the
court
in
obtaining
testimony
from
petitioner.
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
had,
in
some
colloquy
of
the
record,
indicated
that
this
was
the
only
hearing
that
petitioner
would
have.
petitioner's
counsel
requested
a
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
prepare
and
an
adjournment
for
that
purpose
which
was
overruled.
the
position
taken
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
--
explained
to
the
court
what
the
matter
was
about,
was
that
section
305
(d)
conferred
immunity
by
incorporating
section
46
of
the
original
interstate
commerce
act
and
that
the
court
should
agree
with
his
determination
then
it
should
direct
the
witness
to
answer
these
questions
upon
his
return
to
the
grand
jury
room.
argument
was
had
before
the
judge
at
this
point
by
petitioner's
counsel
and
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
in
which
the
position
was
taken
by
petitioner's
counsel
that
there
was
no
immunity
under
section
305
(d)
insofar
as
the
grand
jury
was
concerned
and
that
the
only
immunity
that
applied
was
that,
which
could
take
place
in
an
investigation
by
the
commissioner.
the
court
adjourned
friday
afternoon
till
monday,
and
on
monday,
april
8,
the
court
in
its
decision,
which
appears
that
the
page
34,
35
or
36
of
the
record,
decided
that
there
was
immunity
that
it
covered
both
federal
state
prosecution
and
that
therefore,
the
petitioner
was
directed
to
answer
to
the
question.
a
postponement
was
requested
to
consult
with
the
client
and
30
minutes
was
allowed
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
30
minutes,
petitioner
appeared
once
more
in
the
grand
jury
room
with
counsel
in
the
anteroom
and
there
the
six
questions
directed
to
be
answered
by
the
court
were
put
to
the
witness
again,
that
is
the
petitioner,
and
he
refused
again
on
the
ground
of
possible
self-incrimination
to
answer
the
questions.
the
grand
jury
then
directed
petitioner
once
more
to
attend
in
the
courtroom,
before
judge
levet,
who
was
still
in
the
criminal
part
on
that
day.
the
petitioner
and
his
attorney
and
the
grand
jury
and
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
and
the,
if
i
recall
it
the
marshall
too
who
was
in
charge
of
the
grand
jury,
went
to
judge
levet's
courtroom.
there,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
advised
the
court
that
the
grand
jury
was
there
once
more
seeking
the
aid
and
assistance
of
the
court,
that
the
petitioner
had
not
testified
in
the
grand
jury
has
directed,
but
the
effort
of
the
government
was
still
to
get
his
testimony
and
that
if
he
did
not
answer
the
questions
to
be
put
to
him
by
the
court,
the
request
was
that
the
court
put
the
questions
to
him
that
he
be
found
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
under
rule
42
(a)
as
having
actually
taken
place
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
in
the
immediate
present
of
the
court.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
but
that
was
on
april
8
too,
that
was
the
right
about
an
hour
later
or
something.
the
court
then
directed
--
then
proceeded
with
the
matter.
request
was
made
by
petitioner's
counsel
for
notice,
specification
of
charges,
and
an
adjournment
in
order
to
prepare
for
hearing.
the
ruling
was
that
the
court
was
still
endeavoring,
in
essence
the
ruling
was
that
the
court
was
still
endeavoring
to
get
the
petitioner's
testimony
that
this
was
in
--
in
the
aid
and
assistance
of
the
grand
jury
and
that
therefore,
the
matter
should
proceed.
the
grand
jury's
stenographers
were
called
and
they
read
they're
untranscribed
notes
indicate
what
transpired
in
the
grand
jury
room
namely
that
this
petitioner
had
not
answered
the
questions,
although
directed
by
the
court.
the
district
court
then
directed
petitioner
to
take
the
stand.
objection
was
made
to
this
on
the
ground
that
he
was
now
being
compelled
in
the
criminal
cause
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
they
did
not
swear
him.
i
--
the
question
was
raised.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
judge
asked
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
whether
he
had
been
sworn
and
the
assistant
had
stated
that
he'd
been
sworn
in
the
grand
jury.
i
--
i
said
that
i
have
not
seen
him
sworn
and
the
district
judge
said
that
made
no
diffence
because
this
was
a
continuance
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
before
the
court.
and
that
therefore,
there
was
no
reason
to
swear
this
man
again
because
under
the
court's
theory
which
here
was
also
the
government's
theory,
we
have
a
judge,
jury
--
grand
jury
tribunal
proceding.
the
judge
then
put
the
questions
to
the
petitioner,
who
refused
again
to
answer
on
the
--
on
the
ground
of
possible
self-incrimination
to
putting
of
each
question
there
was
naturally
an
objection
which
was
overruled
by
the
court.
the
court
then
proceeded
to
direct
the
petitioner
to
answer
each
questions.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court?
at
the
recess,
i
had
indicated
that
--
at
the
stage
of
the
proceedings
where
the
petitioner
was
put
on
the
stand
by
the
district
judge
over
the
objection
and
the
questions
have
been
put
to
him,
he
refused
to
answer
–
answer
them,
he
had
been
directed
to
answer
them
and
he
had
refused,
all
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination.
he
was
asked
two
more
questions
by
the
district
judge.
question
number
1,
was
whether
he
would
maintain
his
refusal
to
answer,
if
he
was
sent
back
to
the
grand
jury
room
and
the
other
was
whether
he
believed
that
his
answers
to
those
questions
would
really
incriminate
him?
to
both
those
questions,
objections
were
made
and
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
you
see
--
i'm
sorry.
he
refused
to
answer
the
one
about
whether
he
believed
his
privilege
would
incriminate
him,
but
he
did
say
that
if
sent
back
to
the
grand
jury
room,
he
would
refuse
to
answer.
the
--
the
government
indicated
in
the
argument
on
sentence
that
its
position
was
that
a
substantial
sentence
could
be
–
should
be
imposed
because
the
petitioner
was
not
only
obstructing
this
investigation,
but
also
the
investigations
by
the
other
grand
juries
in
which
he
had
appeared.
the
basic
question
before
the
district
court
was
whether
section
305
(d)
of
the
motor
carriers
act
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
sir.
the
–
the
only
reference
that
the
government
made
to
the
right
to
claim
the
privilege
in
the
other
grand
jury
investigations
was
on
the
sentence
when
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
argued
that
his
refusal
here
to
answer
in
face
of
the
purported
immunity
statute,
indicated
that
his
claim
of
privilege
in
the
other
investigations
was
not
made
in
good
faith.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
i
argued
that
were
–
that
what
the
u.s.
attorney
was
asking
for
was
punishment
for
what
he
had
done
in
the
other
investigations,
the
district
judge,
i
believe,
said
that
that
didn't
matter
here,
that
he
was
concerned
only
with
this
investigation.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
the
government
had
argued
that
they
should
take
into
consideration.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no.
he
said
that
he
didn't
understand
that
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
arguing
for
that
approach
to
the
sentence
by
the
court.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
on
the
first
time
that
we
appeared
before
the
court,
after
the
petitioner
had
refused
to
answer
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
after
arguing
was
had
on
the
question
of
whether
immunity
applied,
the
judge,
in
his
ruling
on
april
8th,
which
appears
on
page
34,
35
of
the
record,
stated
that
in
his
opinion,
there
was
immunity
and
that
therefore,
the
petitioner
was
obligated
to
answer
and
therefore,
he
advised
him
that
he
had
immunity.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
right
your
honor.
the
basic
question
on
the
immunity
point
here
is
whether
section
305
(d),
which
appears
at
page
33
of
petitioner's
brief,
extends
the
immunity
of
section
46
of
the
original
interstate
commerce
act
to
investigations
before
the
–
before
a
grand
jury
investigating
violations
or
offenses
under
section
322
of
the
motor
carriers
act.
section
305
(d),
it
has
two
clauses
and
the
–
at
the
beginning
of
the
section,
it
says
that,
“so
far
as
maybe
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
this
chapter”
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that,
“the
commission
and
the
members
and
the
examiners
in
the
joint
boards
shall
have
the
powers
to
subpoena
witnesses
to
require
the
production
of
documents
and
to
take
testimony
by
a
deposition
relating
to
any
matter
under
investigation
as
the
commission
has
in
the
matter
arising
under
chapter
1
of
this
title.”
this
first
clause
was
separated
from
the
second
clause
by
a
semicolon
and
it
goes
on
to
say,
“and
any
person
subpoenaed
or
testifying
in
connection
with
any
matter
under
investigation,
under
this
chapter,
shall
have
the
same
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
and
be
subject
to
the
same
duties,
liabilities
and
penalties
as
though
such
matter
arose
under
chapter
1
of
this
title,
unless
otherwise
provided
in
this
chapter.”
it
is
it
is
our
contention
that
before
an
immunity
statute
can
be
deemed
to
extend
to
a
particular
tribunal,
authorization
must
be
found
in
the
statute
for
that
body
to
give
immunity.
in
section
46,
which
also
appears
at
page
33,
it
is
the
language
in
any
cause
or
proceeding,
criminal
or
otherwise,
which
this
court
in
hale
versus
henkel
sufficed
to
extend
the
immunity
power
to
the
grand
jury,
because
it
was
there
held
that
the
--
a
grand
jury
inquiry
was
equivalent
to
a
criminal
case
or
the
same
as
in
the
criminal
case
and
that
congress,
by
the
use
of
this
language,
extended
the
immunity
power
to
grand
juries.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
language
of
incorporation
in
305
(d)
took
into
that
section
the
language
“or
in
any
cause
or
proceeding,
criminal
or
otherwise.”
it
is
our
position
that
the
congress
here
was
dealing
with
the
power
of
congress
and
that
--
power
of
the
commission
and
that
it
was
dealing
with
its
powers
to
take
testimony
to
require
the
--
the
appearance
of
witness
and
--
witnesses
and
the
production
of
papers
and
documents
and
that
it
was
not
concerned
with
the
power
of
the
grand
jury.
congress
need
not
or
did
not
have
to
give
the
grand
jury
power
to
investigate
because
the
grand
jury,
i
believe,
would
have
the
inherent
power
to
investigate
the
possible
violations
under
the
motor
carriers
act.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
what
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor
is
that
under
305
(d),
only
the
commission
in
one
of
its
investigations
under
the
motor
carrier's
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
could
give
immunity.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well,
by
subpoenaing
a
witness
in
an
investigation
under
the
motor
carriers
act,
you
would
thereby
give
immunity
because
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
understand
your
honor's
point,
but
it's
the
initial
act
of
the
commission.
if
the
commission
subpoenas
a
person
to
testify
what
remains
for
the
court
deter
--
to
determine
as
whether,
it
was
the
compulsory
process
of
the
commission
and
whether
this
man
testified
pursuant
to
this
compulsory
process
and
therefore,
achieved
the
statutory
immunity.
but
there
must
be
the
initial
act
of
the
commission.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that
is
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
right.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that,
in
essence,
is
my
position
because
there
--
because
the
--
first
of
all,
the
language
of
section
305
(d)
in
my
view,
is
not
sufficient
to
extend
the
--
the
act
or
the
power
to
commit
an
act
to
admit
--
giving
immunity
to
a
grand
jury.
it
restricts
it,
in
my
opinion,
to
the
commission.
furthermore,
the
--
there
is
a
basis
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
by
or
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
--
before
the
commission,
yes.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
it
does.
it
has
separate
criminal
offenses.
it
--
the
difference
between
it
and
the
original
interstate
commerce
act
is
that
in
the
original
act,
they
carry
jail
penalties
as
well
as
fines,
while
in
the
motor
carriers
act,
except
for
some
violations
affecting
commission
personnel,
i
believe,
they
carry
only
fines.
the
violations,
for
which
this
man
was
being
investigated,
would
carry
only
fines.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
by
a
grand
jury
under
the
motor
carriers
act.
now,
there
is
--
there
is
a
difference
between
the
original
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
motor
carriers
act
in
that
in
section
12,
which
describes
the
power
of
the
--
of
the
commission.
there's
also
a
provision
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney
of
a
particular
district
to
conduct
enforcement
proceedings
upon
the
request
of
the
commission.
there
is
somewhat
different
statutory
scheme,
as
i
see
it,
in
the
original
act,
than
there
is
in
the
motor
carriers
act.
while
it
might
be
said
that
the
first
clause
of
the
section
305
(d)
carries
over
some
of
the
provisions
of
section
12,
this
particular
part
of
the
--
of
section
12
is
not
carried
over
into
the
--
into
the
motor
carriers
act.
incidentally,
section
12
appears
at
page
20
--
a
footnote
in
page
22
of
the
brief
for
united
states.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
believe
so
your
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
but
there
are,
for
example,
there's
an
omission
of
the
civil
sanction
which
is
in
the
original
act,
which
is
not
in
the
motor
carriers
act.
that
is
where
one
carrier
diverts
revenue
or
traffic
from
another
carrier,
there
is
a
private
remedy
for
damages
which
accrues
to
the
injured
carrier,
which
does
not
accrue
in
the
motor
carriers
act.
there
are
differences
in
penalties.
there
are
differences
based
–
not
basic,
but
specific
differences
between
all
four
parts
of
the
--
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
now
embodied
in
title
49.
the
basic
regulatory
scheme
that
the
commission
at
the
top
and
the
prohibitions
against
discrimination
and
so
forth,
continue
in
all
four
chapters,
four
parts,
but
as
far
as
the
specific
different
enforcement
provisions,
there
are
differences.
for
example
in
one
part,
i
think
it
is
the
freight
forwarders
part,
there
is
an
amnesty
provision
for
giving
all
that
has
been
done
by
any
of
the
parties
subject
to
it,
prior
to
the
enactment
and
there's
no
such
provision
in
any
of
the
other
three
parts.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
have
found
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
can
speculate,
if
your
honor
wishes
me
to,
but
there
are
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
but
any
answer
i
will
give,
your
honor,
would
be
speculation.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
can
find
certain
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
--
internal
evidence
in
the
statute
as
to
why
there
would
be
a
difference.
i
think
one
reason
is
the
--
the
omission
to
incorporate
the
provision
of
section
12
of
the
original
act
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney
in
their
respective
districts
to
prosecute
or
enforce
the
act
upon
the
request
of
the
commission.
there,
the
pattern
was
and
the
idea
was
as
it
is
in
the
securities
acts
that
there
would
be
no
grand
jury
investigations
throughout
the
united
states,
without
the
commission
doing
--
having
some
part
in
it,
so
that
where
the
commission
might
be
contemplating
some
kind
of
an
investigation
on
a
major
matter,
in
some
district
in
the
remote
part
of
the
country,
some
united
states
attorney
could
start
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
give
immunity
and
prevent
the
commission
from
coming
to
the
natural
conclusion
of
its
investigation
perhaps,
that
is
of
the
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well,
i
am
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
would
say
this,
your
honor.
that
under
the
securities
acts,
the
immunity
provisions
of
the
various
--
of
the
various
security
regulatory
statues,
there
can
be
no
immunity
granted
by
any
grand
jury,
unless
that
investigation
was
instituted
at
the
request
of
the
particular
commission
--
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
if
you
will
look
at
page
49
of
my
brief,
securities
exchange
act,
title
15,
u.s.c.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
page
49
of
petition's
brief.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
then
on
page
48,
the
investment
companies
act.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
49,
the
securities
exchange
act
at
the
top
of
the
page
provides
that
no
person
can
be
excused
from
testifying
in
any
cause
or
proceeding
instituted
by
the
commission
on
the
ground
that
the
testimony
or
evidence,
documentary
or
otherwise
required
by
him
may
tend
to
incriminate
him
or
subject
to
a
penalty
of
forfeiture.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well,
i
would
assume
that
it
--
the
word's
cause
or
proceeding
would
cover
a
criminal
case,
too.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well,
i
would
say
to
that,
your
honor,
that
a
recommendation
by
the
commission
to
the
department
of
justice
or
to
a
specific
united
states
attorney
requesting
prosecution
would
be
the
institution
of
that
cause
or
proceeding,
within
the
meaning
of
that
act.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
not
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that
is
right
your
honor.
what
i've
been
saying
is
that
in
section
12,
which
as
i
say
appears
on
page
22
of
the
government's
brief,
on
page
23
is
the
particular
provision
says
“upon
the
request
of
the
commission,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
any
united
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
-–
page
23
of
the
footnote
above
the
56th
line
down.
“upon
the
request
of
the
commission,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
any
united
states
attorney
to
whom
the
commission
may
apply
to
institute
in
the
proper
court
and
to
prosecute
under
the
direction
of
the
attorney
general,
all
necessary
proceedings
for
the
enforcement
of
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
and
for
the
punishment
of
all
violations
thereof.”
now,
under
that,
passing
the
question
of
whether
this
is
obligatory
or
not,
that
is
whether
a
prosecution
or
investigation
could
be
started
with
--
under
this
provision
without
the
request
to
the
commission,
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
anything
done
unless
the
commission
has
a
hand
in
it
and
that
as
far
as
immunity
is
concerned,
it
maybe
that
this
language
is
not
strong
enough
to
take
away
the
power
of
the
grand
jury
to
investigate
a
particular
offense,
but
we're
not
dealing
with
the
power
of
the
commission
--
of
the
grand
jury
to
investigate,
we're
dealing
with
the
question
of
immunity.
and
the
statutory
scheme
in
the
original
act
shows
that
as
far
as
the
congress
was
concerned,
it
had
in
mind
its
protection
in
section
12,
that
there
would
not
be
any
investigations
unless
the
commission
went
along
with
it
and
was
--
had
some
control
over
them.
now,
i
say
in
answer
to
this
question
about
what
the
policy
is,
i
say
that
the
draftsmen
perhaps,
had
in
mind
that
they
were
not
taking
in
this
provision
of
section
12
into
section
305
or
any
other
part
of
the
motor
carriers
act,
and
therefore,
did
not
want
to
have
any
immunity
power
in
the
grand
jury
in
the
sense
that
the
grand
jury
could
do
an
act
which
would
give
a
possible
subject
of
the
commission
investigation
immunity
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well,
there
is
this,
your
honor.
it
says
with
any
matter
under
investigation
under
this
chapter.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
because
in
the
prior
clause,
if
your
honor
please,
it
says
relating
to
any
matter
under
investigation,
so
that
we
really
have
in
the
second
clause
merely
a
repetition
of
the
language
relating
to
any
matter
under
investigation.
now,
this
is
not
new
language
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
referring
again
to
section
12,
dealing
solely
with
the
power
of
the
commission.
congress
also
used
the
language,
to
any
matter
under
investigation.
now,
in
section
46,
when
congress
wanted
to
extend
the
immunity
power
to
the
grand
jury,
they
didn't
say
to
any
matter
under
investigation.
they
said
in
any
cause,
in
any
case
or
proceeding,
criminal
or
otherwise
and
these
are
commonly
the
words
of
art
that
are
used
to
extend
the
power
of
grand
juries
to
include
immunity
and
this
does
not
appear
in
section
305
(d).
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that
is
right.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
--
the
statute
also
has
to
be
specific
to
give
the
grand
jury
the
power
to
grant
immunity,
because
i
believe
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
--
that
a
grand
jury
has
no
inherent
power
to
grant
immunity.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
and
you
can't
--
i
don't
believe
you
can
stretch
the
language
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
--
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned,
to
give
it
power
to
grant
immunity,
if
--
if
it
doesn't
appear
for
--
plainly
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well,
i
am
the
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
then
i
agree
with
your
honor,
but
the
grand
jury
through
the
process
of
the
court
may
do
an
act
which
would
entitle
a
man
to
immunity
under
specific
statute.
and
before
that,
the
impact
that
he'll
have,
there
must
be
a
specific
statute
which
extends
to
that
point.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
as
far
as
this
phase
of
the
immunity
is
concerned,
that
is
the
case,
your
honor.
now,
the
second
phase
of
an
immunity
questions
is
whether
the
immunity
granted
is
coextensive
with
the
privilege.
it
is
also
our
position,
referring
again
to
section
305
(d)
in
page
33
of
our
brief,
that
since
it
starts
with
the
language,
so
far
as
maybe
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
this
chapter,
that
this
serves
to
whittle
down
the
immunity.
that
this
does
not
make
it
as
extensive
as
the
privilege,
because
there
maybe
many
things
asked
in
the
course
of
this
inquiry,
which
are
not
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
an
investigation
under
this
chapter
of
this
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
namely,
the
motor
carriers
act,
and
therefore,
under
the
specific
provision
of
this
act,
he
may
not
--
the
petitioner
may
not
obtain
immunity.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well,
i
--
i
read
it
definitely,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
starting
so
far
as
maybe
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
this
chapter
with
a
comma,
it
then
goes
on
the
commission
and
the
members
will
have
these
powers.
i
don't
think
that
in
the
matter
of
statutory
construction
that
the
semicolon
plays
any
role
here
and
that
the
limiting
clause
--
the
limiting
phrase
at
the
beginning,
limits
the
latter
part,
the
second
clause
of
the
statute.
that's
our
position
in
any
event.
now,
with
--
like
in
the
minutes
that
remain,
to
get
to
the
procedural
point
that
is
involved
here
and
that
is
what
transpired
in
the
courtroom
which
resulted
in
this
petitioner
being
convicted
of
criminal
contempt.
the
question
basically
there
is
whether
rule
42
(b)
means
anything
in
the
administration
of
contempts
involving
the
recalcitrant
grand
jury
witnesses
or
rule
42
(a)
which
provides
for
the
summary
punishment
of
the
grand
--
recalcitrant
grand
jury
witness,
as
--
for
something
theoretically
done
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
should
--
should
govern.
the
rule
42,
both
(a)
and
(b)
appear
at
page
37
of
my
brief.
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
the
position
that
the
proceedings
in
the
court
on
april
8
were
ancillary
to
the
grand
jury
investigation
and
that
the
judge
was
merely
being
advised
as
to
what
transpired
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
insofar
as
the
petitioner
being
compelled
to
take
the
stand
in
the
courtroom,
judge
lumbard
said,
“it
made
no
difference”
and
brown
remained
mute,
page
62
of
the
record
and
refused
to
speak
at
all,
the
result
that
would
have
been
the
same.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
considered
that
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
before
the
grand
jury
and
this
is
evident
from
his
statement
and
that
also
at
page
53,
the
very
--
the
very
beginning
of
his
opinion,
page
53
of
the
record,
“the
government
now,
however
--
however,
now
takes
the
position
that
if
petitioner
were
to
be
convicted
for
what
went
on
in
the
grand
jury
room
after
he
has
been
directed
to
return
there
and
answer,
that
there
would
have
had
to
be
a
proceeding
under
rule
42
(b),
that
is
there
would
have
to
be
notice,
specification
of
charges
and
the
description
of
the
nature
of
the
criminal
contempt
and
an
opportunity
to
prepare
and
defend
--
and
the
right
to
bail
and
so
forth,
that's
provided
in
section
42
(b).”
the
government,
however,
still
seeks
to
sustain
this
conviction
under
rule
42
(a)
and
it
therefore
reverts
to
the
theory
of
the
district
court
that
this
was
a
continuance
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
that
is
now
--
we
now
have
in
the
southern
district,
a
judge
grand
jury
tribunal
and
although
you
have
the
judge
there,
you
have
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
all
the
requirements
of
section
--
rule
6
of
the
criminal
procedure
are
violated
to
have
a
valid
grand
jury
proceeding
continuing
before
the
court
and
that
the
petitioner
could
have
been
compelled
before
the
court
to
answer
these
questions.
and
that
for
his
refusing
to
answer
these
questions
before
the
court
and
the
grand
jury
is
judged
grand
jury
tribunal,
he
is
to
be
held
in
contempt
under
rule
42
(a)
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
for
a
number
of
years
and
there've
been
other
procedures
followed
in
the
southern
district.
there
have
been
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
my
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
in
this
case?
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
after
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
right.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
the
rule
require
--
rule
42
(b)
requires
in
no
equivocal
terms,
but
he
get
--
receive
a
notice
stating
the
time
and
place
of
hearing
and
allowing
a
reasonable
time
for
the
preparation
of
defense
and
shall
state
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
criminal
contempt
charge
in
describing
it
as
such.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no.
(inaudible)
first
of
all,
there
was
--
there
was
no
notice
in
that
sense
in
that
we
were
not
in
a
position
to
do
the
things
which
might
be
necessary
for
the
defense
of
this
man
in
this
period
of
time.
assuming
that
that
were
notice,
there
was
no
opportunity
to
do
anything
because
we
were
not
at
the
position
where
the
contempt
was
charged.
the
point
here
is
that
there
is
no
contempt
in
the
southern
district
until
the
judges
put
the
questions
to
him
on
the
second
time
and
what
it
was
merely
a
request
by
the
grand
jury
for
the
aid
and
assistance
of
a
court
in
obtaining
answers,
automatically
becomes
a
contempt
when
the
man
refuses
to
answer
those
questions
which
the
court
is
seeking
to
get
answers
for
the
aid
and
assistance
of
the
grand
jury.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
--
that
if
the
government
or
would've
take
the
position
or
receive
notice
on
april
5th,
that
is
when
the
court
made
its
direction,
then
the
error
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
friday,
yes.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
then
the
--
there
is
a
basic
error
by
the
district
court
in
compelling
mine
--
my
client
to
take
the
stand
because
there
is
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
it
is
a
crime
pending.
it's
a
criminal
case
and
he's
being
compelled
to
take
the
stand
in
the
courtroom
to
testify
against
himself.
and
therefore,
the
procedure
assuming
that
your
honor
was
right,
that
there
may
have
been
notice
when
the
direction
was
first
given,
it
leads
to
a
position
that
my
man's
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
in
that
the
court
made
him
take
the
stand
and
testify
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
--
and
that
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well
and
i
don't
know
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no.
i
--
i
do
not
believe
so
because
then
there
would
not
be
any
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
he
was
found,
if
your
honor
would
look
at
the
certificate
on
page
5,
he
was
not
found
guilty
of
contempt
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
in
the
grand
jury.
he
was
found
guilty
of
--
of
contempt
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
before
the
court
and
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury
at
this
time
in
april
8th.
he
wasn't
convicted
of
what
he
did
when
he
went
up
in
the
grand
jury
room.
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
doesn't
argue
that
he
was
convicted
of
--
for
what
went
on
at
the
grand
jury
room.
they
say
that
the
district
judge
was
being
charitable
and
generous
and
not
considering
the
contempt
complete
in
giving
up
--
an
opportunity
to
commit
an
act
of
penitence.
and
that,
when
he
then
refused
to
answer
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
that
therefore,
the
--
and
grand
jury,
excuse
me,
that
the
contempt
was
then
committed
in
front
of
the
grand
–
in
front
of
the
court.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
cannot
strictly
say
that,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
that
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no.
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
negative
thing.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
one
of
the
points
i'd
make
as
far
as
the
position
of
the
government
and
the
matter
of
being
a
continuance
of
the
grand
jury
and
that
is
that
he
had
definitely
took
–
taken
his
position
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
that
carrying
on
before
the
court
was
merely
an
attempt
--
an
invalid
attempt
to
multiply
contempt
and
that
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well
that
--
on
that
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
must
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
on
that,
i
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
right.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
and
that
contempt,
this
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
when
he
went
back
to
the
grand
jury,
he
said
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
--
he
would
not
answer.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
when
he
went
back
to
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
the
first
or
second?
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
the
judge
asked
him
the
question,
“would
you
answer
if
i
sent
you
back
to
the
grand
jury?”
this
is
on
the
second
time
when
he
was
before
the
judge
again
and
he's
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
the
answer
was,
“i
will
maintain
my
refusal,
if
i
am
returned
to
the
grand
jury,”
not
in
very
words,
but
in
substance
that's
what
he
said.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
not
under
the
–
i
don't
believe
that
it
--
that
it
was
a
contempt
which
would
result
in
a
–
a
conviction
of
criminal
contempt.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
he
--
he
said
that
if
i'm
back
in
the
grand
jury,
i
will
not
answer
these
questions,
if
your
honor
please.
if
you
will
look
at
the
citation
on
page
4
--
pages
4
and
5
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
there
--
of
the
record,
there
is
no
reference
to
his
answer
to
that
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
citation
--
neither
citation,
nor
the
order
refer
at
all
to
that
--
to
his
answer
or
to
that
question.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
my
objection
to
the
procedure
is
that
the
court
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
seem
to
follow.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
to
answer
the
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i'm
sorry.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
if
the
refusal
of
the
witness
is
a
refusal
to
return
to
the
grand
jury
room,
your
honor,
then
i
would
say
that
the
court
could
consider
it
a
contempt
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
sentence
him
to
--
to
whatever
42
(a)
permits
him
to
sentence
him
to.
but
if
it's
merely
a
refusal
to
answer
the
question,
i
do
--
do
not
believe
that
where
he
has
once
indicated
his
refusal
in
the
grand
jury
room
that
the
court
can
then,
passing
by
the
rule
42
(b)
provisions,
convict
him
of
criminal
contempt
under
the
rule
42
(a).
now,
i
want
to
make
one
thing
clear
in
answering
to
your
honor,
that
there
was
no
vacuum
of
power
under
my
view
of
the
court,
the
court's
role
here.
there
is
still
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
commit
this
man
without
a
contempt
conviction
until
he
shall
answer
made
to
these
questions,
which
was
not
done
here.
he
was
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
here.
he
was
not
committed
until
he
shall
make
answer.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well,
i
would
like
to
save
that
time.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
may
it
please
the
court?
i
might
point
out
on
the
question
of
sentence.
now
that
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
its
brief
on
so-called
comparable
sentences,
only
one
deals
with
a
witness
and
that's
with
lopiparo
versus
united
states,
referred
to
on
page
14
of
my
reply
brief,
where
he
received
18
months,
but
this
involved
the
credibility
and
good
faith
of
the
witness,
testified
that
he
wasn't
a
--
was
been
unable
to
find
certain
books
he
was
ordered
to
produce.
actually,
in
the
second
circuit
from
where
this
case
comes,
cases
involved
in
the
same
investigation
that
is
the
same
broad
investigation
not
this
particular
grand
jury,
u.s.
against
gordon,
236
f.2d
916
at
page
31
of
my
main
brief,
six
months,
courtney
case,
three
months,
trock
which
was
before
this
investigation,
but
was
reversed
by
this
court,
four
months,
curcio
which
was
before
this
court
last
year,
six
months
with
a
purge
clause,
and
u.s.
against
weinberg
in
the
prohibition
days
or
near-prohibition
days,
60
days.
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
--
on
the
sentence
involved
for
example,
fixing
the
juror,
fixing
the
criminal
case,
corrupting
a
trial
juror,
contempt
of
decreeing
the
case,
not
the
same
as
this.
now,
on
the
objection
on
secrecy,
if
anybody
was
involved
here,
well,
mr.
davis
referred
to
the
government
being
involved
because
there
was
no
specific
objection
and
then
that
this
is
called
out
of
the
record
when
we're
working
on
the
appeal.
we
brought
down
before
the
court
on
april
8,
in
which
although
--
no,
this
no
contempt
proceeding.
you're
not
here
--
we're
not
dealing
with
contempt
here.
we're
seeking
the
aid
and
assistance
of
the
court.
we
don't
want
to
have
anything
here
to
happen
here.
we
just
want
to
have
this
aid
and
assistance
to
the
court.
nobody
is
guaranteed
that
this
is
going
to
windup
in
the
contempt
proceeding
because
everybody
is
trying
to
get
this
man
to
testify.
there
is
nothing
--
no
objection
made
at
that
time
because
we're
not
told
that
this
is
a
contempt
proceeding.
we're
not
told
that
this
is
a
contempt
proceeding
until
the
man
is
in
contempt.
at
the
same
time
that
he's
in
contempt,
he
has
a
contempt
proceeding.
so
how
can
the
--
how
can
anybody
make
an
objection
that
this
proceeding
is
secret,
because
we're
not
in
a
contempt
proceeding
when
(inaudible)
the
problem
district,
until
he
commits
the
contempt,
then
--
then
the
contempt
proceeding
is
over
and
all
you
get
is
a
(inaudible)
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
it
--
it
might,
but
i'm
told.
i'm
told
that
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
have
in
mind
that
it
might
lead
to
a
contempt
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i'm
not
arguing
that
i'm
innocent,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
at
that
point
(voice

if
you
look
at
the

if
you
look
at
the

your
honor,
that's
exactly
what

“may
it
please

the

record
of
the
grand
jury,
again
wishes
to
request
the
aid
and
assistance
of
the
court
with
reference
to
witness

brown”
and
then
below,
mr.
wachtell,
“the
government's
understanding
of
the
nature
of
this
proceeding
is
this,
“at
this
point,
the
grand
jury
is
still
merely
requesting
the
assistance
of
the
court.
what
the
government
would
request
is
that
if
it
appears,
as
were
shown
by
the
testimony
of
the
grand
jury
reporter,
that
the
witness
is
persisting
in
his
refusal,
the
government
will
then
request
of
this
court
that
the
court
itself
in
the
presence
of

grand

will
put
the

questions

mr.

well,
i
have
the
red
light.
mr.
myron

shapiro
and
asking
first,
whether
he's
willing
to
answer
and
now,
the
second,
would
he
answer
them
if
he
was
sent
back
to
the
grand
jury
again.
and
if
the
witness
again
refuses
here
and
now
of
the
physical
presence
of
the
court
or
persists
on
his
refusal
to
answer,
that
the
witness
be
held
in
summary
contempt
under
rule
42
(a)
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
the
court
--
that's
what
i
propose,
mr.
shapiro,
your
honor
please,
i
respectfully
accept
to
this
procedure
and
state
for
the
record
that
this
is
in
lieu
of
a
hearing
under
rule
42
and
the
requirements
of
due
process.
i
request
that
he
be
served
or
furnished
with
the
notice
in
open
court
of
the
charges,
the
specifications
and
afforded
an
opportunity
for
hearing,
a
full
hearing.
the
court
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
i
did
say
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
well
--
what
i
know
in
my
brief
provision,
mr.
justice
black,
i
said
that
i
did
not
believe
that
it
could
be
factually
disputed
that
the
courtroom
was
cleared
at
that
time.
it
is
now
factually
disputed
by
the
government
who
was
--
who
was
taking
some
kind
of
a
statement
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
is
now
with
him,
is
not
with
the
government
anymore
and
he
said
that
the
courtroom
was
not
cleared,
but
there
were
no
spectators
there.
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
i
can
be
in
a
position
to
match
my
recollection
what
this
meant,
this
assistant
united
states
attorney,
but
i'm
willing
to
say
to
the
court
that
the
courtroom
was
clear.
and
it
is
my
recollection
that
it
was
clear
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
marshal
or
deputy
marshal
or
the
bailiff
who
has
the
grand
jury
in
charge,
stood
outside
the
courtroom
door
to
keep
the
people
out.
there
were
strangers
into
the
courtroom
that
were
strangers
to
the
grand
jury
proceeding,
namely,
the
court
clerk,
who
was
not
an
officer
of
the
grand
jury,
the
judge
who
was
an
intruder,
if
this
is
in
a
continuing
for
the
grand
jury
proceeding
then
judge
was
an
intruder,
i
was
an
intruder
and
the
--
the
court's
(inaudible)
was
an
intruder
and
also,
there
was
another
bailiff
of
the
court
inside.
thank
you.
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
to
these
individuals?
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
yes,
i
objected
in
the
whole
procedure.
i
requested
that
we
proceed
under
rule
42
(b).
mr.
myron
l.
shapiro
no,
because
to
fight
the
district
court's
opinion,
i
did
not
consider
that
this
was
a
continuous
of
grand
jury
procedure
as
i
could
not
concede
the
grand
jury
proceedings
with
the
judge
presiding,
whether
it's
in
the
grand
jury
room
or
in
the
courtroom.
