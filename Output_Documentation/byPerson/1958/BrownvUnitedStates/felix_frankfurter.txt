justice

it's
clear
as
in
your
argument,
they're
only
suggestion,
but
it's
the
commission
that
is
giving
the
immunity.
is
that
a
wrong
impression
of
mine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
commission
never
gives
immunity.
the
commission
doesn't
give
immunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
commission
elicits
information
and
that
--
and
the
court
in
for
whom
--
the
refusal
to
answer
is
brought
upon
the
insistence
of
the
commission,
they
then
decide
whether
it
could
be
held.
the
commission
has
no
--
the
commission
is
not
an
immunity-giving
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
the
congress,
if
he
chooses
can
say
a
court
should
compel
testimony
that
is
sought
by
the
commission
and
not
the
testimony
that
is
sought
by
a
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
you
have
to
contend
that
the
legislation
appropriately
construed
means
that,
not
against.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
if
the
–
if
a
grand
jury
makes
an
investigation
regarding
violations
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
motor
carrier
act,
the
grand
jury
can
be
stopped
by
a
fellow
saying,
“i
don't
want
to
testify.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
please
tell
me
mr.
shapiro
whether
the
motor
carriers
act
has
some
regulatory
scheme
substantially
comparable
to
the
regulatory
scheme
of
rail
carriers.
in
other
words,
must
tariff
be
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
classifications
of
commodities,
rates
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
prohibitions
against
rebates
and
discriminations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
are
criminal
sanctions,
violations
of
those
prohibitions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
reason,
assuming
the
question
isn't
crystal
clear,
to
me
one
has
to
do
some
construction
and
further
bearing
in
mind
that
the
immunity
statute,
the
first
immunity
statute,
i
think,
that
we
have
a
general
kind
that
congress
passed
related
to
the
interstate
commerce
act,
what
considerations
or
policy,
if
one
is
left
in
doubt,
should
one
--
should
be
the
one
to
assume
that
congress
meant
to
block
grand
jury
investigations
regarding
criminal
violations
of
the
motor
carrier
act,
which
applied
would
as
against
not
allowing
such
refusal
to
testify
to
block
investigation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
starting
out
with
the
assumption
that
the
statute
isn't
at
least,
ambiguous
to
put
it
my
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
there
must
be
an
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
requires
the
commission
request
to
make
the
u.s.
attorney
make
an
investigation
of
an
alleged
violation
of
the
criminal
statute
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
my
notion.
that
is
my
understanding
of
it.
a
complaint
(voice

--
justice

--
returning
all
sorts
of
a

justice

is
that
a
specific

justice
felix

let's
have
it.
justice
felix

justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
on

justice

anyhow,
that's
not
to
your
reply
brief.
justice

frankfurter
(voice

different

justice
felix

that

a

78

means
a
very
different
set
of
words
than
305
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
says
under
investigation,
under
this
chapter,
what
do
you
make
of
that
phrase,
under
this
chapter?
does
that
chapter
create
criminal
offenses
which
it
is
the
primary
duty
of
the
u.s.
attorneys
throughout
the
country
to
investigate,
if
the
matter
is
properly
brought
to
their
attention
and
the
investigation
by
u.s.
attorneys
is
before
a
grand
jury,
normally?
justice
felix

the
word,
under
this
chapter,
is
not
a
restriction.
under
--
by
proceeding
thwart
by
the
commission
under
this
chapter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
this
chapter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
under
this
chapter,
the
united
states
attorney
brings
matters
to
the
attention
of
a
grand
jury,
why
wouldn't
it
come
under
the
--
had
clause
under
this
chapter
any
investigations
under
this
chapter
not
under
--
under
investigation
instituted
by
the
commission
under
this
chapter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
congress
has
to
be
specific
in
giving
authority
to
the
commission
to
issue
subpoenas
and
as
you
surely
know,
the
commission
makes
a
lot
of
none
investigations
having
no
relation
to
criminal
investigation
or
potential
criminal
investigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
makes
any
number
of
investigations
regarding
rates
or
practices
or
matters
to
be
brought
to
get
attention
of
commerce.
some
times
the
commission
has
been
spoken
of
as
the
(inaudible)
committee
of
the
congress
regarding
not
only
existing
legislation,
but
desirable
future
legislation.
and
therefore,
the
legislation
has
to
be
specific
to
authorize
it
to
issue
subpoenas
in
all
such
investigations
and
for
which
it
can
say
you
have
no
power
to
ask
you
to
testify.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
grand
jury,
if
i
may
suggest,
doesn't
grant
immunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
have
to
find
a
general
clause
covering
the
power
of
a
court
to
compel
testimony
and
to
return
therefore,
to
give
equivalent
immunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
is
that
the
phrase
in
the
second
-–
in
the
second
clause
of
305,
“and
any
person
subpoenaed
or
testified
in
connection
with
any
matter
under
investigation
is
limited
as
the
prior
cause
of
limitation.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
limiting
clause
doesn't
belong
to
the
second
--
that
limiting
phrase
--
that
qualifying
phrase,
also
must
be
implied
into
the
second
clause.
it
isn't
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
simply
equates
the
second
clause
and
equates
rights,
privileges
and
immunity
to
those
defined
by
congress
in
chapter
1
of
this
title.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
--
will
you
be
good
enough
to
state
what
it
is
you
think
is
necessary
under
the
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case.
justice
felix

after
judge
levet
said,
“yes,
you
must
stand.”
justice

(voice

of
the

rule,
he
says

(inaudible)
justice

now
what
--
what
do
you
see
the
rule
requires?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
he
wanted
time
to
think
about
it
and
that
if
he
had
opportunity
for
reflection,
he
might
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
that
has
been
negatives
of
definitive
refusal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
couldn't
be
a
contempt
in
the
grand

room.
we
constantly
come
back
to
that.
justice

(voice

--
justice

called

it
isn't
a
technical
thing.
justice
felix

there
is
no
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the

room.
it's
the
court
that
must
determine
where
the
contempt

his
direction.
justice
felix

what
i
wanted
to
know
and
i'm
afraid
i
can't
carry
my
question
intelligently,
i
want
to
know
if
there
was
anything
too
negative
to
deny
that
when
judge
levet
told
him
to
answer,
he
stood
his
ground
and
indicated
beyond

that
he
would
not
answer.
justice

but
--
justice
felix

did
he
–
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
whether
--
when
he
was
before
judge
levet
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
would
indicate
or
that
anything
to
indicate
when
the
judge
told
him
to
answer,
he
didn't
in
effect
say
to
the
judge,
“your
honor,
i
need
not
to
answer.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
he
said,
“notice
of
your
sending
me
back
to
the
grand

your
honor,
i
now
tell
you,
it's
a
futile
thing
for
you
to
do
and
you
direct
me
to
answer
i
refuse
to
answer.”
would
that
have
been
a
contempt
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
shapiro,
suppose
the
petitioner,
after
judge
levet
had
asked
him
–
had
directed
him
to
answer
these
questions,
and
the
petitioner
had
said
respectfully,
standing
on
what
he
believes
to
be
his
rights,
“your
honor,
i
will
not
answer
these
questions.”
suppose
that
judge
levit
there
said,
“your
condemnation
--
consummation,
i
--
exercising
the
power
that
i
have,
have
ordered
you
to
do
something
you

me
you
will
not
do
it”
and
suppose
then
and
there,
he
said,
“you're
guilty
of
contempt
of
the
order
which
i
have
given
you”
and
then
and
there,
given
him
the
opportunity
to
get
and
--
you
can
say
something
to
this,
what
would
be
your
objection
to
that
procedure?
justice
felix

that's
the
procedure
that
i've
indicated,
not
what
the
record
shows.
suppose
that
--
may
i
(voice

--
justice

suppose
--
suppose
you
put
the
grand

--
your
representations
are
made
to
the
court,
the
district
court,
district
court
hears
it,
gives
you
an
opportunity
to
speak
for
your

and
then
he
says
i
am
sorry.
there
is
an
immunity
statute.
i
can
–
well
i
can
(inaudible)
its
directions,
the

is
ample,
i
order
you
to
answer,
mr.

and
mr.

says
either
direct
it
to
his
counsel,
“your
honor,
i
regret,
but
i
feel
it's
my
duty
to
refuse
to
carry
out
what
you
now
directed
me
to
do.”
justice

suppose
--
justice

frankfurter
--
and
suppose
then
and
there,
no
use
of
sending
me
back
to
the
grand
jury
room,
i
don't
need
any
time
for
reflection.
i
tell
you
now
that
i
will
not
carry
out
your
directions.
the
judge
then
and
there
says
that's
contempt
of
court
and
i
now
sentence
you
to
x
months
or
x
days
or
x
dollars.
what
will
be
your
objection,
if
that
was
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
did
he
do
when
he
was
brought
back?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
took
place
after
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
indeed,
there
was
powerful
argument
by
some
of
the
ablest
lawyers
of
the
day
that
to
require
testimony
before
the
commission
makes
the
court
an
adjunct
of
an
administrative
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
judge
the
second
time,
became
back,
the
judge
redirected
it,
did
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
then
(inaudible)
judge
i've
reflected
on
this
thing
and
i'm
now
prepared
to
answer
and
if
you
--
if
the
government
said,
well,
you
already
committed
a
contempt
because
you
refused
them
the
grand
jury
room,
i
don't
think
we
would
look
with
favor
upon
that
kind
of
proceeding
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
convinced
on
having
to
be
a
little
sharp
on
this
case
because
what
we're
reviewing
here
is
the
certificate
that
constitutes
the
order
on
which
the
sentence
is
based,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
the
certificate,
that's
the
controlling
document
and
the
certificate
indicates
what
he
was
committed
for
--
and
the
proceeding
under
which
he
was
committed
for,
42
(a)
in
that
when
he
came
back
before
judge
levet,
and
judge
levet
propounded
the
same
questions
to
be
sure
that
theretofore
he
directed
him
to
go
to
the
grand
jury
room
to
testify.
it
is
--
that's
the
basis
--
that's
the
fundamental
document
for
the
contempt,
which
is
here
under
review.
now,
the
antecedents,
of
course,
this
is
--
this
is
a
continuing
affair,
but
what
is
--
what
the
court
clamped
down
on
was
that
when
he's
(inaudible)
the
questions
and
he
said,
“i
stand
(inaudible)
i
refuse
to
answer”
and
the
judge
says
therefore,
i
find
under
rule
42
(a)
that
in
my
presence,
maybe
to
my
patience
certainly,
you
don't
care
about
the
court's
order,
you're
going
disobey
it.
i
don't
make
such
complications
out
of
what
is
written
plainly
on
the
certificate's
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
history.
that
was
--
justice

but
if
that
were
in
there,
they
have
great
trouble,
mr.

justice

(voice

because
then
42
(b)
i
mean,
after
all
--
justice
felix

mr.
--
mr.
davis,
the
reason
why
isn't
this
business
is
important
to
what
the
certificate
says.
this
isn't
just
a
paper
stuff.
we
give
the
importance
because
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
what
is
the
name
of
the
cases,
the
--
the
importance
that
this
court
attaches,
if
i
may
so
rightly,
that
there
should
be
a
definitiveness
of
refusal
and
therefore,
bearing
on
what
are
the
name
of
those
cases?
justice

yes.

i
think
of
quinn,
that's
a
case
of
very
important
business.
well
that
therefore
--
therefore,
all
preliminary
deal
is
to
be
important
as
bearing
on
whether
the
--
whether
the
petitioner
here
had
ample
notice
and
that
there
was
an
unambiguous
clarity
that
he
stood
his
ground
of
obstructive
refusal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
after
all
that
has
preceded
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
after
this
preliminary
(inaudible)
is
relevant
on
that
to
me,
very
important
thing
that
a
layman
should
know
without
any
peradventure
of
doubt
that
he
is
really
being
asked
something,
that
if
he
refuses
(inaudible)
the
consequence
--
justice

certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
--
i
think
that's
the
importance
of
this
thing,
if
what
you
call
a
cold
record,
if
this
were
--
if
this
was
the
cold
record
where
the
question
compelling
to
testify
on
whether
or
not,
the
judge
in
good
in
faith,
concluded
that
the
witness
in
good
faith
or
lack
of
good
faith
rather,
refused
to
answer,
i
think
you
would
be
in
great
trouble.
if
this
were
a
question
of
compelling
testimony
--
justice

--
not
a
question
of
immunity
for
refusal.
justice

yes
(voice

you'd
have
a

(inaudible)

the

and
you
had
no

that
this
might
lead
to

for
contempt

quite
absent
from
your

in
the
course

this
proceeding?

it
might.

then

then
why
this
argument
of
innocence?
justice

i'm
saying
--
this
argument
that
it
would
--
nobody
would
be
thinking
about
contempt.
justice

the

merely
indicate
that
the
court
wanted
answers,
that
some
respect
should
be
laid
to
law

order
the
court
