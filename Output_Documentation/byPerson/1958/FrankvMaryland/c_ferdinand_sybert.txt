mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
mr.
chief
justice
with
the
permission
the
court,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
baltimore
statute,
the
health
code
is
actually
prevented
its
preventive
law,
law
we
might
describe
as
preventive
medicine.
in
fact
the
people
of
baltimore
even
since
the
passage
of
section
120
as
the
legislative
history
above
it
indicates
in
1879
have
accepted
the
health
code
as
part
of
the
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
acting
through
the
municipality.
i
have
been
informed
by
the
assistant
baltimore
city
solicitor
at
the
trial
table
that
actually
over
the
past
10
years
there
have
been
only
approximately
5,
10
may
be
20
refusals
of
the
right
of
entry
–
refusal
of
entry
to
the
health
sanitizers.
actually
the
situation
has
been
a
part
of
the
ordered
liberty
mentioned
in
the
palko
case
and
also
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
–
in
wolfe
versus
colorado.
it
has
actually
in
both
in
baltimore
and
in
the
other
cities,
1100
of
them
represented
in
the
amicus
brief
here
of
course
there
are
great
many
more
cities
which
are
not
possibly
and
possibly
not
in
that
league
of
municipalities
but
each
build
up
community,
each
city,
particularly
the
large
cities
have
the
same
problem.
this
right
of
entry
in
order
to
inspect
for
health
conditions
and
health
violations,
in
order
to
determine
such
things
as
should
be
corrected
from
a
fire
standpoint,
safety
standpoint,
have
become
part
of
our
moorage,
part
of
our
way
of
living,
actually
we
have
it.
we
have
had
it,
as
indicated
here
in
baltimore
since
1879
a
few
refusals
by
owners
or
occupants
of
property
of
admission
in
order
to
do
the
salutary
thing
of
determining
whether
or
not
any
conditions
need
to
be
corrected
from
a
health
standpoint
or
from
a
fire
or
safety
standpoint.
actually
we
don't
have
complete
(inaudible)
liberty
in
this
country.
we
have
modified
liberty
i
should
say.
complete
liberty
modified
by
the
restrictions
that
society
has
found
necessary,
to
impose
or
possibly
i
should
say
to
live
by
such
restrictions
as
have
been
found
to
be
necessary
and/or
reasonable.
i
don't
need
to
go
over
the
same
grounds
that
have
been
mentioned
here,
possibly
very
briefly
allude
to
some
of
them.
my
grounds
for
saying
that,
as
to
use
of
property
we
have
a
restriction
in
nature
of
zoning
on
our
(inaudible)
use
of
our
properties,
necessity
to
acquire,
to
secure
permits
for
special
uses
or
the
limitation
that
our
property
maybe
taken
away
from
us
by
condemnation,
if
it
proves
to
be
needed
for
the
public
good.
we
don't
have
completely
free
speech.
my
colleague
has
mentioned
some
of
the
limitations,
yelling
fire
in
a
crowded
theatre
falsely.
we
can't
advocate
subversion.
we
can't
slander
others
and
there
are
of
course
many
other
instances
in
which
free
speech
is
subject
to
limitations.
we
don't
have
completely
free
practice
of
religion.
the
answer
as
colleague
cited,
as
this
court
held
you
can't
offer
a
human
sacrifice
even
if
you
actually
honestly
believe
that,
that
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
your
religion.
our
right
to
free
assembly
is
limited.
we
can't
obstruct
free
passage
on
the
public
streets
or
public
places
by
deciding
to
have
a
meeting
of
some
kind,
to
discuss
something
perfectly
legal.
in
public
heath
the
cases
have
been
cited,
the
north
american
cold
storage
case
against
chicago,
211
united
states,
that
the
government
may
summarily
enter
premises
and
destroy
putrid
food.
it
may
provide,
the
government
may
provide
for
compulsory
vaccination.
jacobson
versus
massachusetts
197
maryland,
quarantines,
from
one
aspect
quarantining
persons,
making
them
stay
in
their
homes
or
bedrooms
when
suffering
from
a
communicable
disease
and
the
other
side
of
the
coin
preventing
access
of
other
persons
to
them,
as
is
certainly
a
limitation
on
our
freedom
of
action,
but
agreed
by
everyone
as
being
needed,
necessary
and
reasonable
in
view
of
our
way
of
living.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
for
the
refusal
of
entry
or
–
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
i
understand
your
honor's
question
to
mean,
whether
it
would
make
for
better
enforcement?
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
i
think
our
position
would
have
to
be
exactly
the
same.
the
degree
of
punishment
i
don't
think
is
affects
the
issue
involved.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
if
they
doesn't
pay
the
$20
under
our
law
he
must
serve
it
out
–
well
i
think
its
$1
per
day
of
the
fine
in
jail.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
well
of
course
all
the
punishment
usually
they
are
set
up
in
matter
of
maximum
at
least,
if
not
maximum
and
minimum
degrees
for
punishment
but
all
punishments
are
due
–
are
subject
to
a
constitutional
provision
or
interdiction
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
so
i
think
the
punishment
would
have
to
be
evaluated
in
light
of
the
degree
of
the
crime
possibly
to
determine
whether
or
not
any
given
case
it
failed
in
the
probation
of
the
constitutional
intervention.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
still
–
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
not
since
the
state
became
a
state
of
united
states
sir,
that
may
have
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
we
have
never
had
imprisonment
for
a
civil
debt
since
1776,
and
possibly
many
years
before
that.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
well
we
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
well,
this
course
is
a
criminal
penalty
in
my
view
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
--
and
we
have
no
method
by
which
you
can
enforce
the
payment
of
criminal
penalty
by
a
civil
process,
as
far
as
i
know
in
state
of
maryland.
to
summarize
very
briefly,
we
feel
that
the
law
is
not
static,
it's
not
in
a
straightjacket.
i
do
want
to
commend
to
your
honors
the
statement
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
wolf
versus
colorado,
to
the
effect
that
due
process
of
law
thus
conveys
neither
a
formal
nor
fixed,
nor
narrow
requirements.
it
is
a
compendious
expression
of
all
those
rights
which
courts
must
enforce
because
they
are
basic
to
our
free
society.
but
basic
rights
do
not
become
petrified
as
of
any
one
time,
even
though
as
a
matter
of
human
experience
some
may
not
too
rhetorically
be
called
a
(inaudible).
it
is
of
the
very
nature
of
free
society
to
advance
in
its
standards
of
what
is
deemed
reasonable
and
right,
representing
as
it
does
a
living
principle,
due
process
is
not
confined
with
any
permanent
catalog
of
what
maybe
given
--
what
may
at
a
given
time
be
deemed
the
limits
or
the
essentials
of
fundamental
right.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
it
as
i
said
quoting
from
wolf
versus
colorado
338
us.
we
feel
then
sir
that
this
ordinance
and
the
enforcement
of
it
is
a
proper
exercise
of
the
police
power.
it
is
necessary
as
shown
very
vividly
in
the
brief
of
amici.
it
is
reasonable
and
therefore
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
were
applicable,
not
prohibited
by
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
not
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
indeed
by
article
26
of
the
maryland
declaration
of
rights
as
decided
in
givner
case.
from
a
balancing
of
the
rights
of
parties,
it
is
justified.
it
is
already
a
part
of
our
way
of
life
and
indeed
is
so
in
all
the
municipalities
of
the
united
states,
thank
you.
