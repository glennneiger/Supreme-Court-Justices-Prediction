justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lipsitz.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
a
criminal
offence
under
the
ordinance,
under
the
baltimore
ordinances
for
an
occupier
of
a
house
to
permit
or
suffer
a
rat
infestation
or
a
collection
of
debris
in
his
house?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
a
misdemeanor
not
to
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lipsitz
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
wouldn't
--
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
quarrel
at
all
with
the
idea
that
a
fireman
could
enter
a
house,
could
break
into
a
house
if
he
felt
that
the
house
was
on
fire.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
differentiate
that
from
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
time
out.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
in
this
case
there
was
plenty
of
time
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
that's
where
the
rats
were,
can
stay
there,
but
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
fireman
who
wanted
to
inspect
the
house
to
see
if
the
wiring
was
so
dangerously
defective
that
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
if
it
continued
that
the
house
would
catch
on
fire
and
maybe
set
fire
to
the
neighborhood.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say,
and
that's
your
ordinance,
your
ordinance
does
discriminate
it
in
that
way,
does
it?
but
assume
that
it
did,
assume
that
baltimore
passed
an
ordinance
allowing
a
fireman
to
go
in
to
inspect,
which
is,
as
to
the
safety
of
the
wiring
and
the
fuses
and
so
on
in
the
house,
from
the
point
of
view
of
danger
of
fire,
would
that
in
your
view
and
the
position
you
take
in
the
present
case
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
now
this
particular
area
i'm
suggesting
only
by
my
question
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
effective
regulation
at
all,
and
maybe
the
fourteenth
amendment
make
impossible
any
effective
regulation,
but
if
there
is
going
to
be
any,
you
have
to
have
inspections
and
a
search
really
on
the
basis
of
not
of
reasonable
cost.
actually
you
don't
know
if
the
fuses
and
the
wiring
dangerous
and
effected
until
you
get
in
and
look
at,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
could
give
you
any
reasonable
cause
to
believe,
that
the
man's
fuse
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
he
have
to
show
the
magistrate
before
a
search
warrant
would
issue
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
probable
cause
–-
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
would
get
a
notice,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
now
isn't
it
also
–
well
why
would
it
be
necessary,
essential
to
the
prosecution
to
show
that
the
rats
were
there
on
the
first
inspection?
wouldn't
it
be
sufficient
or
you
wouldn't
show
that
this
man
and
had
a
notice
free
your
house
of
rats
within
30
days
and
30
days
later
if
they
come
in
and
they
found,
they
find
the
house
infested
with
rats,
isn't
that
enough
to
show
a
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
norris,
i
suppose
in
addition
to
health
code,
the
city
of
baltimore
has
a
housing
code,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
a
housing
code
of
the
kind
i
have
in
mind
is
one
that
requires
the
doors
be
in
certain
places
and
so
on
that
wiring
being
of
certain
kind
and
falling
be
of
the
certain
kind
and
so
forth.
do
you
happen
to
know
if
the
failure
to
comply
with
that
code
its
of
itself
a
violation
of
the
code.
justice
potter
stewart
it
that
way
it
would
be
true
–
justice
potter
stewart
simple
failure
to
abide
our
code
would
be
a
violation
of
that
code,
wouldn't
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
practice
in
order
to
give
the
occupant
a
fair
opportunity
and
what
happens
is
that
an
inspection
is
made
and
the
inspector
points
out
specific
violations
and
the
occupier
or
owner,
in
this
case
usually
the
owner,
gets
notice
of
the
violation
and
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
situation
and
only
then
is
there
a
prosecution
upon
his
failure
to
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
special
housing
court
in
baltimore.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
norris
have
you
made
any
investigation
of
how
long
there
have
been
the
states
have
had
ordinances
or
regulations
such
as
this
–
this
particular
ordinance
dated
to
1879
–
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
–
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
–
how
long
–
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
anything
similar
to
it
prior
to
that
time?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
state
and
you
don't
know
about
the
other
states.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
on
your
present
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
norris
doesn't
the
–
doesn't
your
argument
at
this
point,
isn't
a
directive
--
isn't
the
result
of
it
that
your
present
law
is
to
strict
in
the
requirement,
by
requiring
cause
to
suspect,
because
surely
not
in
12445
cases
did
they,
did
they
have
cause
to
suspect
any
violation
at
all,
the
very
fact
that
they
were
really
567
violations
known
would
indicate
that.

potter

if
that's
matter.
