justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
this
a
new
statute
authorizing
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
there
ever
been
any
statutes,
any
authorizations
like
this
pertaining
to
health
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
your
state,
in
the
free
state
of
maryland.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
the
state
makes
an
historical
examination
(inaudible)
these
kinds
of
things
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
this
ordinance,
but
this
kind
of
thing
helps
better
in
the
(inaudible)
health
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
suggesting
there
was
one.
i
am
asking
whether
there
was
--
there
was
legislative
enactment
in
the
free
state
of
maryland
antedating,
antedating
the
formation
of
this
union
of
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
examined
your
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
get
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
look
at
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
question,
if
they're
empowered
to
authorize
a
health
officer
to
make
certain
inspection,
would
you
then
challenge
the
validity
of
the
legislature
(inaudible)
would
you
challenge
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
impose
a
fine
for
not
letting
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
would
authorize
a
health
officer
to
go
in
there
and
(inaudible)
assume
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
would
it
be
unconstitutional
to
say,
if
you
don't
let
him
in,
you
must
pay
$20?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
go
back
now
to
the
fact
that
he
was
fined
for
not
letting
him
in,
but
did
he
had
the
right
not
to
let
him
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see
therefore
our
question
and
your
problem
is,
is
it
–
is
the
state
of
maryland
is
barred
from
such
a
statute
by
anything
in
the
federal
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
it
barred
from
saying
if
you
don't
let
him
in
you
must
pay
$20.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
dispose
of
this
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
much
–
and
more
importantly
it
seems
that
your
court
has
held
that
this
is
a
violation
of
that
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
little
case
and
it
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
we
found
that
it
wasn't
a
violation
of
the
statute,
but
you
come
here
with
your
court
having
decided
that
under
maryland
law
this
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
right
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
didn't
even
decide
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
didn't
even
decide
that.
we
said
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
was
an
interference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
we
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
we
ever
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
was
so
interpreted
it
would
be
constitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
must
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
all
read
what
this
court
has
written,
but
we
ought
not
to
proceed
on
a
false
assumption.
if
the
perfectly
settled
doctrine
in
this
court,
that
if
a
constitutional
question
is
on
the
horizon,
which
maybe
avoided
by
a
construction
which
would
avoid
it,
we
don't
reach
the
constitutional
question
and
that's
all
that
little
is
and
the
further
fact
is
that
the
little
case
had
to
be
decided,
arose
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
your
case
does
not
arise
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
we
have
to
decide
what
police
intrusion
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
maybe,
it
maybe
the
purpose
for
which
he
comes
and
the
interest
that
he
subserves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
suggested
that
you
look
at
some
of
the
earlier
laws
of
your
state
you
would
find
a
great
distinction
taken
in
regard
to
such
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
and
that
the
argument
you
have
every
right
to
make,
i
don't
mean
legal
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
intellectual
right,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
police
intrusion
in
the
context
of
that
term
and
the
history
of
search
and
seizure
is
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
show
partiality
for
those
people
who
have
money?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
surprised
that
you
suggest
that
you
wouldn't
mind
relaxation
of
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
this
thing
is
as
important
as
it
is,
i
don't
think
it's
desirable
to
allow
such
tenuousness
of
proof
that
you
can
practically
have
search
warrants
in
advance,
just
(inaudible)
take
him
off
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
argument,
but
i
don't
(inaudible)
with
the
argument
that
says
you
can
attenuate
it,
nor
for
the
argument
that
most
people
will
obey
them
--
will
do
it
anyhow
because
that
isn't
any
good
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
what
you
represent
is
an
important
as
you
–
otherwise
you
say
it
is
then
people
ought
to
be
discouraged
from
obey
something
that's
voilative
of
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
that
the
concessions
which
you
made,
which
you
now
abandon
shed
some
light
on
the
premise
with
which
you
start.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
legislature
can
do
something
about
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
that
the
legislature
can
prevent
this
policeman
from
having
this
power.
well
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
speak
of
the
free
state
of
maryland,
and
i
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
free
state
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
to
make
–
this
court
makes
maryland
a
free
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
would
have
to
prove
that,
nothing
could
be
taken
from
the
mere
fact
that
the
inspector
would
force
it,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know,
they
would
have
to
prove
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
prima
facie
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
prima
facie
conclusion
of
guilt
from
the
fact
that
the
inspector
said
that
i
found
rats
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
you
could
say
he
went
in
there
in
order
to
get
evidence
for
criminal
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
went
in
there
for
(inaudible)
to
discover
health
(inaudible),
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
i
am
suggesting
that
he
doesn't
want
that
rat
to
continue
there
for
30
days,
he
wants
those
rats
to
be
exterminated–
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lipsitz
my
guess
is
i
should
expect
you,
i
expect
you
if
you
were
sustaining
your
claim
here
and
hereafter
your
official
to
get
evidence
by
looking
in,
peeping
through
windows
i
should
expect
you
to
be
here
and
say
that
can't
be
allowed
and
i
should
think
it'd
be
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
when
you
say
that
on
this
record
if
you
get
one,
i
think
you
can't
say
that
on
the
basis
of
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
had
to
be
on
the
premises
and
snoop
around.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
in
all
seriousness
that
this
court
would
say,
hold,
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional,
its
void
under
fourteenth
amendment
i
don't
think
that
you
can
get
around
by
having
a
lot
of
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
enforcement
officers
snooping
my
house
in
my
backyard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
other
side?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
that
must
be
pretty
bad
indeed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
agreeing
--
i
am
saying
but
if
your
contention
is
correct
then
you
can
cut
corners.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
suggest
that
he
can
cut
corners
by
moving
around
by
getting
a
telescope
and
looking
in.
i
must
insure
that
(inaudible)
its
illegal
to
do
otherwise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
am
suggesting
that
–
what
you
contend
for
is
unconstitutional
then
getting
the
evidence
that
way
would
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
fellow
who
comes
and
reads
my
water
meter
once
a
month?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
want
to
know,
i
want
your
legal
advice
whether
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
nothing
doing
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
got
into
your
constitution
76,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
must
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
i
go
to
the
health
department
(inaudible).
i
have
very
good
grounds
to
believe
that
my
neighbor's
house
is
rate
infested,
couldn't
they
send
a
pact
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
know
what
happened,
but
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
word
from
your
neighbor
that
he
has
got
a
lot
of
rats
and
we
give
you
notice,
if
you
come
around
in
30
days
and
there
are
still
rats
there,
you
could
take
appropriate
measures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
time
there
are
general
pronouncements
made
by
health
department
say
that
in
a
number
of
instances
we
come
across
these
things
we
now
serve
notice
on
everybody
(inaudible)
fellows
or
what
not
within
30
days
we
are
going
to
come
around
to
see
what's
your
condition
is.
they
do
that
frequently
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
large
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
mind
telling
me
this
about
baltimore,
i
don't
anything
about
baltimore,
but
i
did
have
some
knowledge
about
new
york.
and
in
1901,
there
was
passed
what
was
known
as
the
tenement
house
act,
laying
down
certain
minimum
standards
in
houses,
a
tenement
was
defined
as
a
house
having
three
or
more
families,
sanitary
and
hygienic
condition.
i
think
it
is
a
fact
that
under
that
law
inspectors
go
out,
at
least
when
i
knew
about
it,
would
go
out
to
residences
to
inspect,
merely
to
inspect
and
report
back
with
no
authority
to
do
anything
except
to
inspect
and
report
back,
and
when
those
reports
came
in,
notices
were
then
sent
out
asking
for
their
correction
within
appropriate
time,
depending
on
what
the
condition
is
that
needed
correction.
and
if
within
the
time
there
was
no
compliance,
there
was
then
a
thing
called
a
compliance
division
of
the
tenement
house
department
which
sent
non-compliance
up
to
the
corporation
counsel,
for
the
cooperation
counsel
to
take
appropriate
proceeding.
now
roughly
i
think
that
was
with
substantial
accuracy
that
was
the
law
when
i
know
about
it.
is
there
a
comparable
law
in
baltimore?
justice
felix
frankfurter
somewhere
you
could
not
do
anything
because
the
end
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
indicate
the
approximately
how
many
willing
subjects
to
this
kind
of
potential
investigation
in
baltimore?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it,
5000
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
50,000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
a
lot
of
them
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no
but
a
lot
of
the
dwellers
in
baltimore
are
not
subject
to
this
law
because
they
either
are
one
family
or
two
family
houses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
two
family
houses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
subject
to
the
same
sanitary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
50
houses
are
subject
to
this,
the
ordinance
that's
under
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
50,
000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
50.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
and
this
has
been
on
the
statute
of
1879?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
can
you
tell
us
what
the
history
of
enforcement
under
that
statute
--
under
that
ordinance
has
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
insofar
as
whatever
the
word
is,
acquiesce
comes
to
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
the
answer
isn't
it?(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
brief,
just
to
give
(inaudible)
stating
the
number
of
complaints
per
annum,
a)
the
number
of
complaints
of
this
character
that's
what
i
mean
and
b)
the
number
of
inspections
that
were
made,
individual
inspections,
if
you
are
having
those
figures,
would
they
be
got
in
your
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
am
talking
about
maryland.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
something
about
at
least
even
what
50
years
ago,
i
knew
(inaudible)
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
560
out
564?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
also
a
problem,
there
would
be
a
problem
of
the
scope
of
the
warrant,
the
warrant
has
to
be
particularized
as
to
subject
matter,
alien.
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
have
rats
on
an
unused
garage
or
an
unused
guest
room
on
the
top
floor
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
then
raises
the
question
as
to
the
unreasonable
scope
of
a
warrant,
that
the
warrant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
impediment
ground
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
in
new
york
that
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
the
sanitarian
or
whatever
he
is
called
could
push
the
house
owner
aside
and
walk
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
$20
is
a
corrosive
instrument
to
get
into
consent
to
let
the
man
in,
that's
what
it
amounts
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
imprisonment,
does
maryland
still
have
imprisonment
of
civil
death
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
if
man
gets
a
judgment,
judgment
against
a
man
and
he
doesn't
pass.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
under
your
law
bring
suit
as
one
could
under
the
united
states
law
in
the
similar
situation,
an
ordinary
action
for
debt,
no
criminal
process
at
all
to
collect
the
fine
of
$20,
under
the
federal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
federal
law,
penalties
like
this
maybe
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he
can
move
in
and
just
attend
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
householder
is
agree
with
the
facts,
but
in
fact
there
is
such
nuisance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
in
the
answer
that
you
gave
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
about
the
case,
you
have
answered
the
chief
justice
by
saying
that
if
there
is
real
nuisance
there
the
health
people
can
move
in
and
abet
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i
want
to
know
suppose
there
is
a
difference
of
view
–
between
health
people
and
the
owner,
who
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
my
proposition,
the
house
owner
says
that
health
people
got
a
grudge
against
him,
and
in
fact
there
is
no
nuisance,
but
they
have
said
there
is
a
nuisance
and
they
will
win
and
who
settles
that
conflict
of
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
can't
move
in
and
abate
it.
