mr.
mr.
attorney
general
(inaudible)
the
case
of
north
american
cold
storage
company.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
that
case,
the
ordinance
involved
specifically
accepted
private
dwelling
houses
from
the
effect
of
the
provisions
of
that
ordinance
pertaining
to
food,
which
was
in
--
an
improper
condition
for
human
consumption.
there
was
no
effort
there
to
reach
the
problem
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
on
the
issue
of
the
--
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
as
being
criminal,
vel
non,
i'd
like
to
make
this
remark.
as
pointed
out
by
judge
prettyman
in
the
opinion
in
the
middle
case
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
if
this
doctrine
is
the
basis
of
a
decision
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
no
application
and
therefore,
in
this
case
that
the
fourteenth
has
no
application,
one
is
faced
with
the
anomalous
situation
that
when
government
officials
attempt
to
search
or
inspect
the
house
of
someone
who
is
suspected
of
crime,
they
need
a
warrant.
if
they
are
searching
for
evidence
of
crime,
it
is
said
they
must
get
a
warrant.but
if
they
are
just
searching
or
searching
for
something
else
other
than
evidence
of
crime,
they
need
no
warrant.
and
the
--
the
inescapable
logic
seems
to
be
that
a
man
who
is
suspected
of
crime
therefore,
has
a
greater
right
than
a
man
who
is
not
suspected
of
crime.
and
this
defeats
the
argument,
in
my
submission.
now,
as
to
the
point
of
the
availability
of
search
warrants
for
heath
purposes
in
the
city
of
baltimore,
it's
pointed
out
in
appellant's
brief,
and
i
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
here
that
under
section
208
of
the
very
baltimore
city
health
code
which
is
here,
in
issue,
and
it's
at
page
82
of
the
pamphlet,
which
is
in
the
record,
portfolio
132.
"a
provision
is
made
as
follows,
whenever
the
commissioner
of
health
may
have
just
caused
to
suspect,
it's
a
little
stronger
in
the
requirement
of
cause
that
any
baggage,
clothing,
bedding
or
goods
of
any
character
found
in
the
city
are
infected
with
any
contagious
or
infectious
diseases
which
may
be
dangerous
to
the
public
health,
he
shall
proceed
to
the
nearest
magistrate
and
obtain
a
warrant
and
have
said
goods
removed
to
such
places
as
he
may
deem
best."
here
is
clear
basis.
here
is
clear
authorization
for
warrants
to
be
obtained
in
connection
with
proceedings
under
the
baltimore
city
health
code.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
prevention
of
contagious
diseases
which
are
referred
to
in
this
code,
in
a
prior
section,
and
which
includes
such
onerous
things
as
yellow
fever
and
cholera,
and
typhoid,
and
typhus,
and
diseases
of
that
nature
is
certainly
as
important
as
cleaning
up
rodents.
and
in
that
situation,
the
commissioner
of
health
must
obtain
a
warrant.
why
should
he
not
here
be
held
to
the
same
requirement?
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
it
has
always
been
the
--
the
philosophy,
the
tradition,
the
spirit
in
this
country
that
the
state
--
that
the
state
exists
for
the
individual,
not
the
individual
for
the
state.
that
the
right
of
the
individual
is
the
paramount
right.
that
we
live
under
a
rule
of
law
and
not
under
a
rule
of
men.
that
houses
are
today,
close
together,
is
all
the
more
reason
why
the
essential
right
of
privacy,
the
little
bit
that
remains
to
a
man
of
his
privacy
should
be
protected
by
this
court
against
any
incursion.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
court
should
not
permit
a
situation
to
grow
up
where
we
are
more
clean
or
more
healthy
at
the
cause
of
being
less
free.
thank
you.
