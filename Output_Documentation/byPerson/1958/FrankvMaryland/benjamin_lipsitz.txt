mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
may
it
please
your
honor.
in
this
appeal
from
his
conviction
in
the
criminal
court
of
baltimore,
appellant
challenges
the
validity
of
one
of
the
health
ordinances
of
the
mayor
and
city
counsel
of
baltimore
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
on
the
ground
that
this
ordinance
purports
to
impose
upon
him
a
criminal
penalty
for
mere
refusal
to
submit
to
an
invasion
of
his
home
by
a
health
officer
of
that
city,
acting
on
a
suspicion
alone
and
without
any
search
warrant.
the
ordinance
of
course
is
limited
in
its
operation
to
the
boundaries
of
the
city
of
baltimore,
but
the
problem
that
is
here
presented
is
broader
in
scope
and
raises
the
question
whether
the
homes
of
the
people
and
the
privacies
of
life
shall
be
subject
to
violation
by
government
employees
without
warrants
throughout
the
nation
wherever
men
live
under
comparable
health
regulations.
the
immediate
issue
is
relatively
clear
cut,
the
question
maybe
perhaps
best
phrased,
“can
a
health
officer
of
the
city
of
baltimore
lawfully
enter
and
search
a
private
dwelling
house
where
the
owner
or
occupant
objects?”
appellant
contents
that
he
cannot,
that
the
ordinance
under
which
he
purports
to
act
is
unconstitutional
in
that
it
subjects
him
to
an
unreasonable
and
an
unlawful
search,
a
depravation
of
his
liberty
and
property
and
a
trespass
upon
his
property
all
in
violation
both
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
and
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
ordinance
is
set
out
in
the
record
and
in
appellant's
brief,
and
it
reads
as
follows.
it's
at
page
56
of
the
pamphlet,
copy
of
article
12,
which
is
the
health
article
of
baltimore
city
code
or
at
page
three
of
appellant's
brief.
rule
120,
whenever
the
commissioner
of
health
shall
have
cause
to
suspect
that
a
nuisance
exists
in
any
house,
cellar
or
enclosure,
he
may
demand
entry
therein
in
the
daytime
and
if
the
owner
or
occupier
shall
refuse
or
delay
to
open
the
same
and
admit
a
free
examination,
he
shall
forfeit
and
pay
for
every
such
refusal
the
sum
of
$20.
now
the
case
arose
in
this
manner.
the
mayor
and
city
counsel
of
baltimore,
exercising
within
the
limits
of
that
city
all
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
maryland,
made
this
ordinance.
on
february
27,
1958,
a
inspector
or
a
sanitarian
gentry,
an
officer
of
the
bureau
of
road
and
control
of
the
baltimore
city
health
department
received
the
complaint
of
rats
in
the
cellar
of
a
person
who
lived
in
4300
block
of
reisterstown
road,
baltimore,
maryland.
this
is
the
block
in
which
appellant's
house
is
located.
acting
on
this
complaint
sanitarian
gentry
went
to
appellant's
house.
he
had
with
him
two
student
inspectors
who
were
being
trained
to
take
places
in
the
multiple
dwelling
inspection
program
of
the
city.
as
a
prelude
to
his
examination
of
appellant's
property,
he
knocked
on
the
door,
but
no
one
responded.
so
began
to
make
an
inspection
of
the
outside
and
the
yard
of
the
premises.
now
the
house
which
appellant
occupies
is
a
detached
plain
wooden
structure.
there
are
pictures
of
the
house
in
the
record
opposite
pages
29
to
35,
there
are
eight
photographs
there
which
were
introduced
in
evidence
by
the
state,
they
show
the
house
and
part
of
the
ground.
the
inspector
looked
around
the
yard
and
he
testified
in
the
criminal
court
of
baltimore
that
he
saw
undue
trash
and
debris.
he
testified
that
he
saw
a
pile
which
he
later
determined
was
composed
of
rodent
feces,
straw
and
other
items.
he
did
not
at
any
time,
although
he
was
pressed
to
do
so,
identify
the
feces
as
rat
feces,
he
insisted
that
they
were
rodent
feces.
at
this
point
he
apparently
felt
that
he
had
cause
to
suspect
that
there
was
a
nuisance
in
appellant's
house.
appellant
about
this
time
emerged
from
the
house
and
spoke
with
the
sanitarian
in
the
yard.
he
asked
the
sanitarian
what
he
was
doing
on
the
property,
and
the
sanitarian
gentry
identified
himself,
showed
his
badge,
explained
his
suspicions
and
demanded
entry
to
the
cellar
of
the
house
to
make
an
inspection
for
rodents
or
rats.
appellant
informed
him,
according
to
the
sanitarian's
testimony,
that
he
would
not
let
him
in
the
house.
the
language
that
he
used
was,
according
to
the
sanitarian,
you
will
have
to
get
a
search
warrant
if
you
want
to
get
in
this
house.
this
is
set
out
at
page
19
of
the
record.
the
sanitarian
did
not
enter
the
house.
on
the
next
day,
february
28th
he
returned
to
the
house
with
two
police
officers.
he
stated
in
his
testimony
that
the
purpose
of
the
return
visit
was,
“that
he
wanted
some
witnesses,”
this
is
set
out
at
page
21
of
the
record.
he
did
not
find
anyone
at
home
on
this
occasion.
he
made
an
outside
inspection
of
the
premises
again.
he
did
not
observe
the
interior
of
the
house
on
either
visit.
he
then
betook
himself
to
a
magistrate,
to
magistrate
neiven,
who
was
one
of
the
police
magistrates
in
baltimore
city
and
who,
it
happens,
sits
in
the
housing
court
in
baltimore
city
ordinarily.
he
went
to
magistrate
neiven
and
he
made
affidavit
that
he
suspected
that
there
was
a
nuisance
in
appellant's
house
consisting
of
undue
debris,
trash,
and
rat
infestation
and
that
appellant
had
refused
to
allow
him
entry
to
the
house.
and
based
on
this
affidavit
a
warrant
was
issued
and
on
march
5,
1958,
one
year
ago
exactly
today,
appellant
was
arrested
while
he
was
seated
in
his
automobile
on
the
street
by
a
police
officer
and
he
was
taken
to
the
station
house.
now
on
the
next
day
march
the
6th
he
came
up
for
trial
before
the
magistrate
on
the
complaint
of
the
sanitarian
and
he
was
duly
found
guilty
and
fined
$20
as
the
ordinance
provides.
he
took
an
appeal
as
is
his
right
under
the
practice
in
baltimore
city
to
the
criminal
court
of
baltimore
which
ordinarily
sits
as
a
nisi
prius
court,
but
which
has
special
appellate
jurisdiction
in
appeals
from
police
magistrates,
and
he
was
granted
there
a
trial
de
novo
as
is
the
practice
at
baltimore
city.
the
case
was
heard
again,
the
inspector
testified,
the
police
officer
testified,
the
appellant
did
not
testify
in
either
case
and
the
court
entered
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
fined
the
appellant
$20
in
accordance
with
the
ordinance.
appellant
then
asked
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
to
hear
this
case
on
certiorari.
there
is
a
provision
in
maryland
law
for
that
sort
of
procedure.
it's
little
used
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
discretionary
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
case
when
they
think
it's
of
such
general
public
interest
that
they
should
take
it
up
and
determine
it.
in
this
case,
they
denied
certiorari
and
the
appellant
filed
his
appeal
to
this
court.
none
of
the
courts
below
entered
any
opinion.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
prior
to
this
case,
i
believe
in
1953,
had
decided
a
case
called
givner
against
the
state,
in
which
among
other
points
the
same
section
was
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
its
constitutionality.
appellant
in
all
the
lower
courts
made
his
defense
on
the
constitutional
grounds,
and
in
each
instance
the
verdict
against
him
necessarily
sustained
the
validity
of
the
ordinance.
now
appellant
contends
that
a
health
officer
of
baltimore
city
cannot
lawfully
enter
his
home
without
a
search
warrant
when
he
objects.
he
contends
that
this
ordinance
is
repugnant
to
the
constitution.
it's
repugnant
to
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
repugnant
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
in
the
baltimore
city
health
code
your
honor,
the
entirety
of
which
is
included
in
the
record
in
this
orange
covered
pamphlet.
there
are
a
number
of
sections
pertaining
to
hygiene
of
housing.
among
the
requirements
of
those
sections
in
my
understanding
is
that
an
occupier
of
premises
in
baltimore
city
shall
keep
the
premises
clean,
and
free
from
all
sorts
of
debris
and
anything
that
could
amount
to
a
nuisance
.there
is
one
specific
section
which
says
that
he
shall
keep
the
premises
free
from
rodent
infestation.
i
don't
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
don't
intend
to
quote
the
words,
but
there
is
a
provision
to
keep
the
premises
free
from
rodent
infestation
i
believe.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i'm
reading
from
section
112
your
honor.
every
dwelling,
that's
on
page
104
or
folio
54
of
the
orange
pamphlet,
section
112,
it
reads,
“every
dwelling
and
every
part
thereof
shall
be
kept
clean
and
free
from
any
accumulation
of
dirt,
filth,
rubbish,
garbage
or
similar
matter
and
shall
be
kept
free
from
vermin
or
rodent
infestation,
that
may
have
been
why
the
inspector
insisted
on
rodent
rather
than
rat.
as
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
as
to
that
your
honor,
there
are
penalties
for
specific
sections
in
this
act.
there
is
blanket
penalty
section
in
this
act
which
says
if
a
--
if
an
offense
is
not
otherwise
punished
then
the
fine
shall
be
$5
or
$20
or
something
like
that,
i
don't
remember
the
exact
amount.
this
--
these
sections,
some
of
them
provide
for
notices.
they
make
the
provisions
for
notices
that
are
not
mandatory,
but
discretionary.
sometimes
the
procedure
is
that
a
notice
is
given
to
correct
the
condition
which
the
inspector
thinks
is
objectionable.
then
the
penalty
accrues
when
you
fail
to
correct
on
a
second
inspection.
is
that
your
honors
point?
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
thanks.
now
there
cannot
be
too
much
emphasize
in
my
submission
in
this
case
that
the
place
that
this
sanitarian
was
trying
to
get
into
more
of
–
on
his
own
volition
and
without
a
warrant
was
a
man's
private
dwelling
house.
there
is
no,
nothing
to
do
here
with
any
place
that
might
be
affected
in
anyway
with
a
public
interest.
this
is
a
place
where
a
man
lives.
this
court
has
itself
said
in
the
agnello
case
that
while
the
question
has
never
been
directly
decided,
it
had
always
been
assumed
that
a
lawful
search
of
a
man's
private
home
could
not
be
made
unless
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
or
unless
there
was
a
warrant.
now
there
was
no
arrest
lawful
or
otherwise
incident
to
this
attempt
to
make
the
search.
the
arrest
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
do
not
concede
that
point
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
point
really
reaches
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
ordinance
as
i
have
stated
only
requires
cause
to
suspect.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
even
if
the
requirement
was
for
a
probable
cause
and
even
if
the
facts
which
the
sanitarian
claims
to
have
observed
were
sufficient
to
amount
to
probable
cause
i
would
contend
that
he
should
be
required
in
order
to
meet
the
guarantees
of
the
constitution
to
take
this
probable
cause
to
a
magistrate,
rather
than
to
himself
make
the
determination.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
had
he
gone
and
gotten
a
warrant,
my
client
informed
him
that
he
would
have
let
him
in
the
house.
my
--
i
stand
this
before
this
court
not
to
contest
the
necessity
for
inspections
as
such.
i
am
really
here
on
a
procedural
point.
i
don't
say
that
the
health
department
of
baltimore
should
not
keep
the
city
clean,
obviously
they
should
and
obviously
this
is
a
proper
legislative
determination.
i
contend
that
the
method
that
they
use
here
is
so
vagrant,
so
far
beyond
the
balance
of
reasonableness,
so
directly
contrary
to
everything
that
in
this
country
people
have
been
taught
amounts
to
due
process
and
fair
play
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way.
here
is
a
situation
where
an
inspector
himself
decides
that
he
is
suspicious
and
then
he
himself
decides
that
he
will
go
in
and
when
you
are
here
before
the
magistrate
on
the
charge
that
you
refuse,
what
do
you
have
a
chance
to
contest.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
as
a
matter
of
technical
law
your
honor
i
think
that
the
information
that
he
was
able
to
testify
to
did
not
amount
the
probable
cause
to
suspect
anything
inside
the
man's
house.
yes,
i'd
say
that
it
would
be
insufficient
technically.
i
do
not
base
my
contentions
on
that
point
however.
i
am
willing
to
say
--
i
am
willing
to
agree,
if
necessary,
that
what
he
saw
amounted
to
cause
to
suspect
or
even
to
probable
cause.
if
that
is
the
point
that
your
honor
raised.
if
i
have
not
made
it
clear
i
wish
your
honor
would
inform
me
and
i
will
try
to
reach
the
point
better.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
that
claim
was
made
in
the
trial
court,
your
honor.
we
content
that
after
the
--
we
contented
first
on
the
grounds
of
the
constitutionality
and
then
we
contented
that
even
assuming
that
the
ordinance
was
valid,
the
facts
which
he
testified
to
were
not
sufficient
to
establish
cause
to
suspect
which
is
what
the
ordinance
required,
that
was
my
contention
in
the
trial
court.
and
this
--
and
this
court
also
stated
in
the
agnello
case
that,
“the
search
of
a
private
dwelling
without
a
warrant
is
in
itself
unreasonable
and
abhorrent
to
our
laws”
and
i
think
that's
a
statement
that's
just
as
effective
today
as
at
the
time
that
it
was
first
written.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
this
ordinance
your
honor
has
been,
this
ordinance,
this
ordinance
has
been
on
the
books
of
baltimore
city
to
my
knowledge
at
least
since
1879.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
not
the
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
in
the
free
state
of
maryland
your
honor
i
know
only
of
this
ordinance
and
perhaps
the
question
came
up
by
the
simple
occurrence
of
circumstances.
many
search
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
the
particular
ordinance
your
honor
has
been
on
the
books.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
have
been
able
to
find
no
case
or
authority
which
directly
holds
that
in
health
situations
you
are
entitled
to
use
this
type
of
ordinance.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
know
of
none
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
cannot
say
that
i
made
the
examination
that
a
scholar
of
the
particular
point
might
make,
but
i
made
what
i
consider
to
be
an
adequate
examination
for
the
purposes
of
my
case.
i
did
not
find
any
legislation
that
might
have
existed
of
that
nature.
i
find
no
basis
in
the
history
of
maryland
for
this
ordinance.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
am
aware
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
no
sir.
if
your
honors
please
perhaps
the
most,
the
most
earliest
aspect
of
this
ordinance
is
this.
in
my
submission
this
ordinance
not
only
violates
the
federal
guarantees
which
i
have
mentioned,
in
effect
they,
it
attempts
to
outlaw
them.
this
ordinance
imposes
a
criminal
penalty
for
the
mere
refusal
to
submit
to
an
inspection
accompanied
by
(inaudible)
on
substantial
constitutional
ground.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
would
your
honor
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
in
this
manner,
to
impose
the
fine
in
the
manner
that
it
does.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
no,
your
honor
it
would
not.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
right,
but
i
go
back
a
little
further
i
think.
i
go
back
to
the
fact
that
in
my
submission
the
penalty
is
imposed
for
the
refusal
to
let
him
in.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
right
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
right
your
honor.
my
contention
is
that
the
state
of
maryland
or
any
state
in
effect
is
barred
by
the
federal
constitution
specifically
by
the
fourth
and
the
fourteenth
and
more
specifically
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
to
make
this
type
of
ordinance.
this
question
was
before
your
honors
in
the
case
of
district
of
columbia
against
middle
in
1952.
in
the
middle
case
mrs.
middle
who
was
the
resident
of
district
of
columbia
was
arrested
for
interfering
with
a
health
officer
of
the
district.
she
had
locked
the
door
to
her
home
and
refused
to
admit
the
health
inspector
on
the
ground
that
it
would
abridge
her
constitutional
right.
now
she
was
convicted
in
the
lower
court.
she
was
–
she
went
to
immediate
appellate
court,
the
municipal
court
of
appeals
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
here
held
in
her
favor
on
constitutional
ground
and
the
case
came
here.
this
court
saw
no
necessity
to
decide
the
constitutional
question.
this
court
found
in
mrs.
little's
favor
by
determining
that
what
she
had
done
was
not
interference
within
the
meaning
of
the
pertinent
district
of
columbia's
statue.
however,
in
reaching
that
decision
and
stating
the
reason
for
that
decision
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
court
really
condemned
enactments
of
the
type
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
justice
black
in
writing
for
the
majority
in
stating
the
reason
why
this
was
not
interference
mr.
little's
action
said
as
follows.
the
right
o
privacy
in
the
home
holds
few
higher
place
in
our
system
of
laws
to
justify
a
statutory
interpretation
that
would
impose
a
criminal
punishment
on
one
who
does
nothing
more
than
respondent
did
here.
now
what
did
respondent
do
in
the
little
case?
she
knocked
her
door
and
she
told
the
health
inspector
that
you'll
have
to
get
a
warrant
to
get
into
this
house.
the
circuit
of
appeals
speaking
through
judge
prettyman
said
that's
right,
you
have
to.
this
court
said
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
question,
but
if
we're
to
say
that
this
is
a
crime
it
would
abridge
in
effect
the
constitutional
guarantees.
that's
the
reasoning
it
seems
to
me
of
the
decision
of
this
court
that
what
mrs.
little
did,
a
mere
refusal
to
unlock
the
door
accompanied
by
substantial
constitutional
remark
(inaudible)
could
not
validly
made
a
crime.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
not
in
my
submission
your
honor
because
the
ordinances
in
baltimore
city
required
only
that
the
appellant
refuse
to
admit
the
health
inspector.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
and
you
have
held
in
little
case
that
it
wasn't,
not
on
constitutional
ground
but
simply
because
this
court
found
it
necessary
to
say
that
what
mrs.
little
did
couldn't
be
a
violation
of
the
law
or
it
was
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well,
if
your
honor
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
you
can't
dispose
of
this
case
by
avoiding
the
constitutional
question
if
i
may
out
it
that
way.
you
interpret
this
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
it
may
be
your
honor.
in
the
little
case
you
interpret
this,
the
word
interfere,
and
you
say
that
this
can't
be
interference
because
if
you
call
it
interference
it
is
such
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
a
home
that
it
wouldn't
be
right.
in
the
instant
case
your
honor,
the
only
question
is
did
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
sir?
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
you
said
--
you
interpreted
the
meaning
of
the
word
interfere
which
none
of
the
lower
courts
had
done
in
that
case,
and
you
found
in
mrs.
little's
favor
by
saying
that
standing
on
constitutional
grounds
and
refusing
admission
to
an
inspector
without
a
warrant
was
not
interference,
and
mr.
justice
black's
statement
which
in
my
submission
explains
the
rationale
of
that
decision,
is
that
the
right
to
privacy
in
a
home
holds
such
a
high
place
in
our
laws
that
any
other
statutory
interpretation
would
impose
a
criminal
punishment
and
would
be
unjustified.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i'm
reading
mr.
justice
black's
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
sir?
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
you
didn't
use
those
words
but
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
there
is
no
other
reason
for
reasoning
that
can
be
attached
to
mr.
justice
black's
statement.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i'm
reading
from
page
17
of
my
brief
your
honor,
in
which
i
stated
in
my
argument
in
this
sentence.
this
court
clearly
and
succinctly
expressed
that
sentiment,
namely
that
the
ordinance
was
bad,
or
the
statute
in
the
district
was
bad
and
its
statement
of
the
reason
for
the
ruling
which
it
made
on
the
interpretative
question
in
the
little
case
and
then
the
quotation
is
from
mr.
justice
black's
opinion.
the
right
to
privacy
in
the
home
holds
too
high
a
place
in
our
system
of
laws
to
justify
a
statutory
interpretation
that
would
impose
a
criminal
punishment
on
one
who
does
nothing
more
than
respondent
did
here.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
if
i
may
read
your
honor's
own
language.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
yeah,
what
respondent
did
here
was,
and
i
quote
your
language,
was
to
tell,
and
then
i
quote
your
language,
“the
health
officer
who
had
no
search
warrant,
knocked
to
enter
her
home
to
inspect
the
sanitary
condition.
she
had
also
refused
to
unlock
her
door”
and
then
in
an
another
place
you
say,
“a
mere
refusal
to
unlock
the
door
accompanied
by
remonstrances
or
on
substantial
constitutional
grounds.
now
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
what
appellant
did
in
this
case
was
certainly
no
less
or
no
more
than
what
mrs.
little
did
in
that
case.
in
fact
your
honors
under
baltimore
city
ordinance
it's
possible
for
one
to
merit
criminal
punishment
by
doing
even
less
than
what
respondent
did
in
the
little
case,
because
the
ordinance
in
baltimore
city
not
only
says
if
you
refuse
but
if
you
delay
to
open
the
door
and
admit
a
free
examination,
you
maybe
punished.
now
further
on
in
the
ordinance
it
says
such
refusal
shall
be
punished
by
the
forfeit
of
the
$20.
but
who
is
to
determine
when
the
delay
becomes
the
refusal,
and
is
the
mere
statement
to
the
officer,
first
let
me
see
your
search
warrant,
a
delay
or
a
refusal
sufficient
to
merit
a
criminal
sanction.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
first
part
of
your
honor's
statement.
of
course,
as
to
the
second
part
of
the
statement,
it's
true
that
my
case
does
not
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
arise
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
your
honor's
own
decision
in
wolf
against
colorado
i
think
solves
that
problem.
in
that
case,
this
court
through
your
honor
stated
that
the
protection
which
is
at
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that
is
the
right
to
be
secure
in
the
home,
in
the
privacy
of
the
home
from
unwarranted
and
arbitrary
intrusion
by
police
officers
is
enforceable
against
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
it
is
part
of
that
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
which
was
referred
to
in
the
palko
case
and
which
was
reiterated
in
your
honor's
decision
in
the
wolf
case.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
in
one
sense
you
do
your
honor.
i'll
submit
to
your
honor
that
whether
that
policemen
wears
a
blue
uniform
with
a
badge
on
his
chest
or
whether
he
comes
in
mufti
with
a
health
inspector's
badge
in
this
pocket,
is
not
the
crucial
issue
and
this
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
insofar
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
an
invasion
by
an
officer
be
he
in
uniform
or
not
be
he
a
policemen
or
a
health
inspector
or
a
building
inspector
is
an
intrusion
upon
a
man's
privacy
and
is
just
as
harmful
an
intrusion,
whatever
the
nature
of
the
man's
mission
is.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
not
at
all
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
if
your
honor
pleases,
i'd
like
to
go
a
step
further
on
that
point.
i
think
that
--
i
cover
in
my
brief
and
i
--
the
argument
as
to
whether
this
is
a
criminal
or
a
non-criminal
search.
now
i
submit
that
it's
a
criminal
search
and
i
submit
that
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
section
that
was
dealing
alone,
section
120,
clearly
it's
a
criminal
prosecution.
if
you
refuse
to
let
the
inspector
in
you
get
hailed
into
a
criminal
court
and
fined
$20.
now
if
you
look
at
the
general
provisions
of
the
baltimore
city
health
code
about
nuisances,
the
provisions
which
require
that
a
health
inspector
go
in,
make
an
examination
and
if
he
finds
anything
wrong
send
a
notice
to
the
occupant
who
then
is
given
a
chance
to
rectify
the
condition
and
a
second
inspection
is
made,
if
the
condition
isn't
rectified
he
is
then
hailed
into
court.
well
part
of
the
evidence
that's
necessary
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
for
the
state,
if
they
make
the
reinspection
and
drag
the
defendant
into
criminal
court,
is
proof
of
the
facts
of
what
was
found
on
the
first
inspection.
you
have
to
prove
the
inspector
has
to
come
and
testify
that
he
entered
and
he
found
certain
allegedly
defective
conditions.
otherwise
they
can't
even
make
a
prima
facie
case.
now
to
that
extent
certainly
this
search
is
as
much
a
police
search,
a
search
connected
with
a
criminal
prosecution
as
any
search
for
a
--
by
a
uniform
policemen
for
evidence
of
murder
or
rape
or
anything
else,
and
is
it
anymore
important
your
honors
to
enforce
the
health
laws
than
it
is
to
enforce
the
criminal
laws?
an
officer
who
was
patently
after
evidence
of
a
crime
in
the
recognized
sense
of
one
of
the
felonies
or
common
law
crimes
or
misdemeanors,
would
not
be
heard
or
come
before
any
court
and
say
i
have
the
right
for
my
suspicion
to
come
into
this
house.
and
the
fact
that
his
mission
is
for
a
purpose
which
is
somewhat
perhaps
more
salutary,
certainly
is
no
excuse
to
try
to
give
him
such
broad
powers
in
a
health
situation.
i've
been
taught
that
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness,
but
does
that
make
a
health
inspection
holy?
is
there
anything
about
a
health
inspection
that
should
allow
the
sanitarian
to
trample
on
the
basic
fundamental
guarantees
that
are
afforded
to
us
by
the
constitution?
you're
dealing
here
with
an
area
of
civil
liberty
that's
pretty
broad
and
sensitive
and
precious,
it's
a
man's
home.
it's
the
right
to
be
let
alone
in
that
home
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
olmstead
case.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
when
there
was
a
fire
not
at
all
your
honor,
that
would
be
an
emergency.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
of
emergency,
of
necessity.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
hold
no
brief
for
rats
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
curiously
enough
your
honor
in
the
baltimore
city
fire
inspection
code,
private
dwelling
houses
are
specifically
exempted
from
that
type
of
inspection.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
building
code
which
is
general
and
which
says
that
building
inspectors
can
go
in
to
make
inspections
to
protect
public
health
and
safety,
but
in
the
fire
prevention
code,
specifically
designed
for
the
purpose
which
your
honor
mentioned,
inspections
of
private
dwelling
houses
are
exempted,
they
can't
go
into
private
dwelling
house.
there
is
a
definition
of
a
private
dwelling
house
which
pretty
much
narrows
what
is
a
private
dwelling
house
under
the
particular
statute,
but
it
includes
this
type
of
house
that
we're
dealing
with
here
today,
i
believe
the
definition
excludes
what
would
now
be
considered
multiple
dwelling,
but
when
you're
dealing
with
one
man's
private
home,
the
fire
inspector
in
my
submission
your
honor
can't
go
in.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
it
may
your
honor,
very
well,
and
i
hold
no
brief
for
people
who
have
money
either
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
if
the
authority
was
cast
in
the
terms
of
this
ordinance
that
is
based
on
suspicion
and
without
the
necessity
to
go
to
any
intervening
magistrate,
yes
it
would.
i
don't
object
to
the
inspections
as
such
your
honor.
i
object
to
the
means
used.
i
say
let
the
health
inspectors,
let
the
fire
inspectors,
let
any
of
these
government
officials
have
the
same
right
of
entry
that
a
policeman
would
have,
that
any
other
law
officer
would
have.
if
he
has
cause
let
him
go
to
a
magistrate
with
it.
let's
put
the
protection
of
a
judicial
or
a
neutral
mind
between
a
government
employee,
whether
he
be
petty
or
great,
and
the
citizen
in
his
home,
that's
all
i'm
asking
for
in
this
case
essentially.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well,
that
maybe
true
your
honor,
let
me
answer
that
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
would
argue
that
before
a
trial
court
if
this
case
--
such
a
case
were
presented.
let
me
answer
that
in
this
manner
your
honor,
one
of
the
main
cries
that
my
brother
who
supports
warrantless
searches
make
is
this
cry
of
necessity,
of
impossibility,
we
can't
do
it
that
way.
i
like
to
point
this
out,
in
the
first
place
there
isn't
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
they
can
or
can't
do
it,
but
aside
from
that
this
complaint
is
a
mere
assumption,
there
is
no
real
proof
here.
there
is
a
shining
example
of
what
happens
when
inspectors
are
not
allowed
to
go
in
unless
they
have
warrants
and
it's
right
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
in
the
district
of
columbia
since
1949,
a
health
inspector
for
one,
i
don't
know
about
others,
but
i
assume
the
others
too,
because
the
principle
is
the
same,
cannot
enter
a
private
home
over
the
objection
of
the
owner
or
occupant
unless
he
has
a
search
warrant.
that's
the
effect
of
judge
prettyman's
decision
in
the
little
case
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
been
no
epidemics
in
the
district
of
columbia
of
unusual
consequence.
the
rats
are
not
running
rampant
down
the
corridors
of
this
courthouse
or
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
district
of
columbia
has
not
dissolved,
has
been
taken
over
by
the
germs
and
the
rodents,
because
of
the
fact
these
inspectors
are
required
to
get
inspections.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
in
the
district
of
columbia
he
has
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment,
which
means
probable
cause
–-
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
--
yes
probable
cause
and
they
have
functioned
that
way.
now
my
brothers
in
their
brief
and
especially
my
brothers
for
the
amici
curiae
have
pointed
out
another
thing
that
will
help
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
most
of
the
people
are
going
to
let
the
inspectors
in
anyhow.
even
if
your
honors
stand
for
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
ordinance
and
say
the
constitutional
guarantees
say
you
can't
do
it,
most
of
the
people
they
point
out
and
it's
probably
true
are
going
to
let
the
inspectors
in
anyhow.
now
i
don't
think
that
point
is
really
the
answer
to
the
case.
the
police
used
the
cry
and
perhaps
still
do,
we
need
more
power.
we
have
to
have
the
authority
to
go
into
people's
house
so
that
we
can
stop
all
this
crime.
it's
horrible,
people
are
getting
killed
and
raped
and
murder
all
over
the
place,
but
in
this
country
at
least
there
has
been
a
distrust
to
that
sort
of
thing.
the
courts
and
the
people
have
not
thought
fit
to
entrust
police
officials
or
government
employees
of
any
kind
with
this
type
of
power.
and
i
say
your
honors
that
the
health
laws
are
important,
but
they
are
no
more
important
than
the
protection
of
the
people
against
crime.
and
they
should
be
subject
to
same
sort
of
limitation,
and
if
you
want
to
tamper
the
limitation
a
little
bit,
if
you
want
to
let
the
health
inspector
get
his
warrant
on
some
slighter
type
of
cause
than
is
required
in
the
criminal
sense
of
probable
cause,
i
have
no
real
objection
as
to
that,
but
let's
not
let
him
go
into
that
house
because
he
suspects
there
is
a
nuisance
in
there
and
because
he
determines
himself.
the
man
whose
job
it
is
to
get
in
and
find
violation
and
he
is
probably
a
zealous
public
servant
and
want
to
do
a
job
well,
let's
not
let
him
determine
when
he
is
going
to
go
in
my
house
or
your
honor's
house.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
agree
with
your
honor
and
my
willingness
to
go
along
was
a
rhetorical
willingness,
i'm
speaking
in
the
sense
of
argument.
i
stand
here
four
square
for
probable
cause
and
search
warrants,
but
if
you
get
to
the
situation
of
balancing
necessity,
and
if
you
say
that
the
necessity
is
so
great
that
that
health
inspector
(inaudible)
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not,
there
are
ways
perhaps
to
work
it
out,
but
i
stand
for
probable
cause,
they
didn't
get
probable
cause
like
any
one
else.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
that
argument
–-
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
agree
with
your
honor,
the
argument
of
–
the
most
people
will
obey
is
not
originally
my
argument
it
belongs
to
my
brother
i
gave
it
back
it
him,
but
i
say
your
honors
that
this
case
involves
something
so
fundamental
and
so
basic
to
the
liberty
and
proper
well
being
of
all
others
that
if
this
ordinance
stand
on
the
books
and
be
held
constitutional,
we
have
gone
a
long
way
down
to
road
to
what
sometimes
turned
a
police
statement.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well,
your
honor
i
submit
that
that's
not
the
case.
i
am
trying
to
present
sensible
arguments
which
perhaps
as
many
times
occurred
in
legal
arguments
as
your
honor
knows
far
better
than
i,
at
least
the
one
giving
a
little
ground
for
the
sake
of
argument
only.
under
this
ordinance
your
honor
we
no
longer
have
a
rule
of
law,
we
have
rule
of
men,
this
policeman,
this
health
inspector
is
under
the
law,
he
is
the
law
with
respect
to
this
point,
there
is
nobody
to
go
and
say
him,
there
is
no
one
to
tell
him
when
–
whether
he
should
not
go
in.
now
another
argument
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
the
legislature,
i
don't
content
that
the
legislature
can
not
make
proper,
reasonable
regulations
for
the
governance
of
the
public
health
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well,
i
suggest
to
your
honor
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
heard
the
emphasis
on
the
free
state
your
honor
and
i
appreciate
it.
i
suggest
the
your
honor
that
the
best
way
to
see
that
this
doesn't
happen
is
to
–
for
this
court
to
put
of
the
bar
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
legislature
of
the
free
state
of
maryland
or
the
legislature
of
any
other
state.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
no
sir,
you
are
not
–
well
make
maryland
appreciate
the
constitution,
not
make
maryland
law.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
your
honors
make
maryland
low,
maryland
has
a
perfect
right
to
make
its
own
health
laws
but
it
has
no
right
to
broaden
this
health
law
to
the
point
where
they
infringe
upon
basic
guarantees
of
human
liberties,
things
that
are
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
your
honor
i
would
say
–
no.
i
would
say
–
i
would
say
that
that
again
that
goes
so
far
along
the
line
that
it
would
infringed
that
fourteenth
amendment.
that
would
be
better
in
this
situation
because
then
it
would
be
a
routine
search,
a
routine
inspection
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
he
would
be
then
be
required
to
clean
up
the
rats
and
if
he
didn't
clean
up
the
rats
he
would
be
punished
in
a
criminal
court,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
he
would
get
a
notice,
but
when
they
go
to
punish
him
in
a
criminal
court
your
honor
one
of
the
things
that
they
would
have
to
prove
to
make
their
prima
facie
case
would
be
the
presence
of
the
rats
at
the
time
of
first
search.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
the
proof
would
be
the
inspector's
testimony
that
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
when
--
if
a
second
search
was
made.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
no,
no,
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
they
would
simply
be
the
normal
procedure
that
–-
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
yes
the
purpose
of
the
first
search
among
other
thing
is
to
get
evidence
to
use
in
the
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
because
if
the
man,
if
the
inspector
–
it
goes
in,
whether
if
he
goes
in
with
the
warrant
or
without,
let's
say
he
observed
rat
and
if
he
leaves
a
notice,
or
sent
a
notice
to
get
rid
of
rats
in
30
days,
then
in
30
days
he
goes
back
makes
a
second
inspection.
now
the
second
inspection
is
clearly
in
my
opinion
unconstitutional
even
if
the
first
one
isn't,
but
you
are
not
doing
much,
if
you
just
deal
with
first
but
assuming
that
he
goes
back
and
finds
a
rat
on
the
second
trip
and
he
–
and
the
man
is
brought
in
the
criminal
court,
the
first
thing
they
have
to
prove
is
that
that
inspection
was
made
on
a
given
date
and
that
rats
were
found.
now
that's
certainly
evidence
gained
in
the
first
search
and
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
this
is
what
judge
holsoff
was
complaining
about
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
little
case
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
oh
he
went
in
there
perhaps
for
a
dozen
purposes
your
honor
and
---
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
your
honor
what
his
primary
purpose
was
i
don't
know
but
assuming
that
he
went
in
there
primarily
to
stop
the
health
thing
and
he
went
in
there
secondarily
to
get
evidence
for
the
second
search,
it
would
still
be
bad
in
my
submission.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
agree
with
your
honor's
suggestion.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
your
honor
in
my
experience
the
notices
always
recite
the
first
inspection
and
things
like
that.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
enough.
there
would
have
to
be
proved
in
my
opinion
of
the
condition
existing
the
form
of
basis
for
the
giving
them
a
notice.
there
is
no
requirement
in
this
case
to
just
send
the
notice
to
a
man
that
your
house
is
full
of
rats.
the
violation
if
you
look
at
it
from
that
right
is
for
failing
to
abate
in
those
based
on
the
first
inspection.
now
without
the
first
inspection
i
don't
think
he
could
validly
convict
the
am.
i
don't
think
my
brothers
will
argue
with
me
on
that
but
of
course
they
have
their
opportunity.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
suggest
that
they
be
limit
this
to
the
same
requirements,
they
be
allowed
the
same
leeway
as
other
enforcement
officers.
let
them
go
to
the
houses
and
if
most
of
the
people
will
let
them
in
on
a
consensual
basis
that's
fine.
if
they
come
to
a
situation
where
they
can't
get
in,
let
them
take
their
facts
that
they
--
that
they
now
think
--
amounts
the
cause
of
suspect,
let
them
take
their
facts
which
i
submit
should
be
made
to
amount
of
probable
cause
to
a
magistrate.
a
magistrate
will
give
him
a
warrant
if
he
believes
that
there
is
a
nuisance
in
the
house
and
then
they
can
go
in.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
instant
case
they
have
what
would
be
a
bit
of
evidence.
i
have
not
examined
a
great
many
health
cases,
i
have
been
in
a
few.
generally
they
have
sufficient
evidence
to
get
a
warrant
in
my
opinion.
if
i
may
say
so
magistrates
on
the
whole
don't
require
any
plethora
of
evidence,
if
a
prima
facie
basis
is
offered
to
them,
they
generally
are
willing
to
issue
a
warrant.
but
if
the
man
can't
get
the
evidence
and
he
can't
get
the
search
warrant,
i
can't
really
say
that
that
is
anything
horrendous.
that's
the
reason
i
am
standing
here.
if
he
can't
get
the
search
warrant,
he
can't
meet
the
requirements
of
this
country's
constitution
and
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
in.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
have
quite
your
honor.
the
--
my
brothers
for
amici
curiae
have
some
cited
some
figures
from
other
city
as
to
inspections
but
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
number
is
not
the
answer
to
the
case.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
imagine
this
force
is
a
pretty
ample
in
baltimore
city
your
honor
to
deal
with
most
conditions
that
arise.
this
force
has
been
around
for
a
long
time.
if
your
honor
pleases
the
question
–-
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
he
was
the
dissenting,
no
i'm
saying
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
yes
i
was
saying
that
judge
holtzoff
was
complaining
that
this
was
not
a
search
for
evidence
to
be
used
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosection.
i
wasn't
misleading
your
honor.
i
was
saying
that
--
i
was
attempting
to
show
your
honors
that
this
was
a
search
in
connection
with
evidence
to
be
used
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosection,
because
they
use
this
evidence
in
the
prosecution
after
the
second
searches
and
the
notices.
i
was
just
saying
that
my
explantation
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
yeah
no,
no,
i
would
not
be
here
as
this
judge
holtzoff
on
this
point.
but
if
the
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
think
it
would
your
honor,
i
think
the
proof
that
he
was
able
to
produce
here
as
per
the
conditions
on
the
outside
would
get
him
a
warrant.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
he,
he
was
told
by
--
he
testified
that
it
was
rodent
feces.
he
was
asked
a
number
of
times
to
specify
what
kind
of
rodents,
he
wouldn't
say.
he
charged
the
man
in
(inaudible)
which
was
issued
by
the
magistrate
for
violating
this
(inaudible)
section,
he
charged
them
with
rat
infestation.
but
all
he
would
say
was
rodent
infestation
and
he
would
not
go
any
further.
i
think
if
there
was
sufficient
free
period
to
get
a
warrant
on
that.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
should
hope,
i
should
hope
to
have
the
opportunity
your
honor
to
come
here
and
say
that.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
your
honor
he
found
here
trash,
debris
and
a
pile
of
half
of
ton
as
he
called
of
rodent
feces.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
i
don't
contend
and
i
at
one
time
tried
to
contend
in
the
baltimore
city
housing
court
that
he
couldn't
even
come
in
the
yard,
but
i
don't
think
that's
really
tenable.
he
can
come
in
the
yard
i
suppose,
there
is
a
no
way
for
me
to
keep
him
out.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
unless
i
get
a
--
unless
i
get
a
rip
from
some
court
or
a
shot
gun
i
don't
see
how
i
am
going
to
avoid
his
walking
into
the
yard.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well
suppose
he
stood
on
the
side
walk
and
observed
these
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
yes
well
this
house
is
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
your
honors
have
the
pictures.
i
don't
content
that
the
condition
of
this
particular
premises
was
good.
i
contend
that
the
principle
involved
overwrite
the
condition
of
this
particular
premises.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
say
that
this
court
should
in
this
case
stop
these
health
officers,
these
government
people
from
cutting
corners,
when
it
comes
to
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
your
honor,
i
am
–
i
am
–
(inaudible)
for
me
to
stay
at
here
and
make
suggestions
that
it
might
benefit
the
law
officers
that
want
to
make
inspections,
that's
beyond
my
province.
but
suggest
perhaps
from
a
basis
of
my
own
experience
that
magistrates
will
be
satisfied
with
proof
of
this
nature
and
will
give
them
a
warrant.
i
don't
intend
to
suggest
anything
more
than
that.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
would
agree
with
you
your
honor.
the
danger
here
is
that
allowing
this
inspector
to
himself
make
the
determination.
in
this
particular
case
for
instance
when
he
was
asked
on
his
cross
examination
couldn't
you
as
well
had
barged
in
judge
an
hour
later,
or
a
two
hours
later,
his
answer
was
no,
i
was
busy.
i
have
two
student
inspectors
that
i
have
to
release
at
3
o'clock.
i
have
to
be
in
my
office
at
3:30
everyday
to
write
out
my
reports
and
then
when
–
and
this
is
a
basis
on
which
a
home
sort
to
be
open
to
intrusion
by
officers
wherein
(inaudible)
what
when
if
what
was
the
emergency
he
said
everybody
is
in
emergency.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
something
more
than
that
should
be
necessary
before
privacy
of
homes
is
violated
by
a
government
employee.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
sure,
the
question
of
furnaces
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren
have
asked,
i
would
have
to
contend
that
in
application
of
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
by
consent
i
submit
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
by
–
by
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
well,
my
legal
advice
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
my
legal
advice
is
this
your
honor,
if
you
would
have
got
the
water
from
the
water
company,
you
enviably
at
least
agree
that
their
man
can
come
in
there
and
read
your
meter.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
or
they
cut
off
the
water,
you
don't
have
to
buy
the
water
from
them,
if
you
don't
want
to
let
their
inspector
in
you
can
dig
your
own
well
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
right,
right.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
they
don't
attempt
to
force
their
way
in.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
may
i
please
your
honors.
in
regard
to
the
question
which
mr.
chief
justice
warren
asked
as
to
what
the
commissioner
of
health
of
baltimore
could
to
if
man
did
let
the
inspector
in
despite
the
ordinance,
he
can
do
several
things.
the
health
code
which
is
part
of
the
record
indicates
in
section
112
thereof
that
if
he
is
satisfied
that
a
condition
constitutes
an
actual
menace
to
health
he
shall
proceed
forthwith
to
cause
the
same
to
be
abated.
in
a
subsequent
section
114,
he
is
given
power
if
a
householder
refuses
to
correct
an
objectionable
condition
to
do
it
himself,
with
his
own
agents
and
people
and
to
charge
the
householder
for
the
work.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
he
can
move
in
and
do
it
your
honor
and
in
section
116
he
can
move
the
householder
out.
he
can
condemn
the
house
in
effect
and
say
nobody
lives
here
until
the
conditions
are
corrected.
so
there
is
ample
ammunition
in
the
hands
of
the
commissioner
of
health
here
to
rectify
any
objectionable
conditions.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
in
this
case
your
honor,
under
this
ordinance
the
householder
gets
no
chance
to
–
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
am
trying
to
answer
that
by
pointing
out
that
under
the
whole
health
ordinance
in
my
submission
the
householder
gets
his
hearing
for
the
first
time
in
a
criminal
court
when
he
is
accused
of
violating
some
section
of
this
ordinance;
he
has
no
recourse
before
that.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
i
think
then
that
the
health
people
have
the
authority
to
do
it
anyhow.
now
if
he
understand
there
and
physically
tries
to
bar
the
way,
then
i
think
the
solution
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
commission
of
health
calls
the
police
and
arrests
the
householder
not
for
the
health
ordinance
violation,
but
for
disturbing
the
peace
or
resisting
an
officer
or
whatever
they
call
it.
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
that
conflict
of
fact
is
settled
in
the
present,
under
our
law,
in
my
opinion
in
the
criminal
court
of
baltimore
or
before
a
magistrate
on
the
question
--
mr.
benjamin
lipsitz
the
--
your
honor
i
am
trying
to
cite
to
the
court
what
the
statute
provides,
what
the
mechanics
of
it
are.
i
don't
think
i
should
be
held
accountable
for
it,
i
don't
know
but
it
seems
to
be
that
if
the
commissioner
of
health
under
this
ordinance
tries
to
move
in
and
you
get
a
recall
–
an
householder
who
gets
himself
a
gun
and
says
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
in,
he
is
easily
arrested
for
carrying
firearms
or
whatever
the
violation
is.
the
householder's
only
recourse
under
this
whole
code
is
to
stand
on
its
ground
and
say
i
won't
let
you
in
and
i
will
take
my
chances
on
your
$20
fine.
now
this
$20
fine
can
be
quite
a
coercive
weapon
because
they
don't
have
to
wait
for
the
next
day.
they
can
make
the
demand
to
come
in
every
five
minutes
and
the
commitment
that
the
magistrate
signed
in
this
case
and
which
is
used
in
every
case
says
if
you
don't
pay
the
fine,
you
would
go
to
jail
as
my
brothers
have
informed
you
and
the
magistrate
in
this
case
in
fact
its
outside
of
the
record
but
i
was
present
in
the
magistrate's
court
told
the
inspectors
go
back
and
if
he
doesn't
let
you
in
(inaudible)
i'll
fine
them
$20
again
and
this
is
insurmountable.
now
the
householder
has
no
recourse
other
than
his
claim
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
ordinance
and
for
claming
that
for
having
(inaudible)
claim
that
he
has
arrested,
that
is
one
of
my
strong
objections
to
this
ordinance.
now,
if
your
honors
--
