state
of
maryland.
mr.
lipsitz
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
question
of
searching
for
–
searching
to
see
what
types
of
properties
you
have
and
most
of
the
statutes
simultaneously
say
that
if
you
refuse
to
permit
him
to
enter
they
put
an
arbitrary
assessment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
don't
permit
to
force
their
way
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
norris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
norris
suppose
in
this
particular
search
he
found
evidence
of
the
violation
of
one
of
the
sections
of
the
code,
could
you
use
it
to
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
criminal
section.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
not
be
able
to
use
it.
well
could
he
support
a
criminal
prosecution
later
on
the
basis
of
what
he
found
there?
such
as
mr.
lipson
as
said,
if
he
goes
in
there
and
he
finds
conditions
such
that
as
to
constitute
a
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
it
under
your
ordinance
he
must
give
him
a
notice,
give
the
honorary
notice
and
in
30
days
if
he
doesn't
clean
that
up
then
he
is
guilty
of
an
offence.
now
if
the
owner
doesn't
clean
it
up
after
the
notice,
and
he
is
prosecuted,
can
the
inspector
use
the
evidence
that
he
found
on
his
first
investigation
to
support
the
notice
and
therefore
the
delinquency
and
therefore
the
–
therefore
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
it
wasn't
for
the
first
one
and
if
it
wasn't
for
the
notice
that
is
based
upon
this
dereliction
he
couldn't,
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
the
second
finding
of
unsanitary
conditions
could
he.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
do
actually
support
your
prosecution
and
your
conviction
on
the
evidence
he
gets
at
this
first
search.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
it
was
proven
absolutely
that
there
was,
there
was
no
need
shown
at
the
time
the
man
first
made
the,
made
in
the
search
on
which
a
notice
was
based,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
would
it
support
a
conviction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
–-
then
you
use
is
–-
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
point
is
and
that
that
--
the
question
that
i
ask
you
is,
isn't
he
supporting
the
prosecution
and
the
conviction
on
the
evidence
that
he
acquired
through
this
first
search?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
he
it
without
--
without
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
investigating
the
house
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
--
did
they
insist
on
searching
the
house
in
these
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know,
but
in
answer
to
justice
clark's
question
you
said
that
was
enough
to
support
the
notice
upon
which
you
could
base
a
conviction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
then
your
answer
wouldn't
be
no
to
his
question,
would
it
not,
that
it
is
not
sufficient
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
they
could
do
that
with
any
householder
whether
he
has
got
rats
or
not,
all
they
have
to
do
is
say
we
order
you
to
clear
your
premise
with
rats
in
30
days
and
if
you
don't
do
it,
we
will
arrest
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
arrest
him
without
knowing
whether
there
are
in
your
house
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
they
would
have
to
make
a
search,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
it
is
the
same
problem
we
had
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
nuisance
is
not
matter
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
question
is
this.
a
nuisance
is
not
a
crime
in
maryland?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
search,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
probable
cause
or
anything
else,
i
want
to
know
the
answer
to
this
question,
is
this
a
nuisance,
the
maintenance
of
a
public
nuisance
a
crime
in
maryland.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
could
you,
could
you
let
us
know
also
mr.
norris
how
many
prosecutions
have
been
under
the
same
section
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
mr.
norris
that
$20
was
the
fine
assessed
against
this
petitioner,
is
that
the
maximum?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
no
imprisonment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
norris,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
this
man
has
been
fined
$20
for
his
violation
of
this
particular
section
of
the
law.
now
that
doesn't
enable
the
city
in
any
way
to
remedy
the
condition
it
suspects
in
his
property.
what
avenue
is
open
to
city
from
that
point
on
to
remedy
this
situation,
assume
they
still
feel
that
there
are
rats
in
that
apartment
or
home?
how
would
they
proceed
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
the
man
went
in
and
then
they
go
through
a
proceeding
of
this
kind,
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
the
only
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
opinion
would
an
affirmance
of
this
case
carry
with
it
the
right
to
search?
chief
justice
earl
warren
premises
of
this
kind
or
would
it
be
merely
carry
with
it
the
right
to
punish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
the
distinction
i
was
trying
to
make,
but
do
you
feel
that
it
wouldn't
carry
with
it
the
authorization
to
make
a
search
if
the
--
if
the
householder
said
no?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
position
if
instead
of
this
being
as
you
do
with
merely
a
regulation,
a
health
regulation
punishable
by
maximum
of
$20
fine
that
the
law
provided
instead
for
a
punishment,
misdemeanor
punishment
of
6
months
in
jail
or
$500
or
both,
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
just
(inaudible)
here,
take
this
very
statute
and
say
that
instead
of
maximum
of
$20
fine
to
–
in
order
to
bring
about
the
orderly
administration
of
your
health
laws
it
provided
as
a
punishment
6
months
in
jail
or
fine
of
$500
or
both
as
most
misdemeanor
statutes
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
no,
i
mean
your
legal
argument
--
would
your
position
--
well
we
will
put
it
this
way,
if
you
had
such
a
statute
and
this
petitioner
came
here
sentenced
to
6
months
in
jail
for
having
failed
to
do
that,
would
your
argument
and
your
position
be
the
same
as
it
is
in
this
case
for
both
the
statute
and
the
fine
and
are
limited
to
$20?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
happens
to
this
man
if
he
doesn't
pay
that
$20?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lipsitz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now
mr.
--
