mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
in
the
light
of
the
wolf
case
that
the
main
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
search
or
not
to
search,
that
the
intended
inspection
was
unlawful.
now
we
will
have
to
of
course
take
into
consideration
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
also
in
discussing
what
maybe
unlawful
search
and
what
may
not
be
an
unlawful
search.
and
as
was
said
in
the
united
states
versus
rabinowitz
there
were
and
is
--
there
is
again
–
there
is
against
the
unreasonable
searches
but
there
is
not
against
reasonable
searches.
in
other
words
reasonable
searches
can
be
allowed.
now,
the
question
of
what
is
a
reasonable
search
cannot
be
answered
in
any
definite
definition
because
the
constitution
has
not
stated
what
is
an
unreasonable
search,
therefore,
each
case
must
be
decided
on
its
own
facts
and
circumstances.
now
historically
the
abuses
which
gave
rise
to
the
constitutional
provisions
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
grew
out
of
searches
or
evidence
to
be
used
in
criminal
prosecutions
and
dates
way
back
to
these
writ
of
assistance
in
england
and
in
maryland
we
also
have
a
article
26
which
is
the
similar
to
the
fourth
amendment
which
is
in
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
76
i
think
it
antedates
the
fourth
amendment
and
it's
now
article
26,
it
was
article
23
at
that
time
i
believe
your
honor.
now
in
the
boyd
versus
united
states
this
case,
this
court
--
involving
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
involved
certain
custom
laws
and
this
court
made
the
observation
then
that
in
search
for
penalties
or
forfeitures
which
were
incurred
by
commission
of
offenses
against
the
law
that
this
was
a
quasi
criminal
nature,
the
forfeitures
and
penalties,
and
therefore
the
court
said
we
think
that
they
are
within
the
reason
of
criminal
proceedings
for
all
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
they're
throughout.
it
seems
that
this
court
said
that
fourth
amendment
applies
to
criminal
prosecution.
(inaudible)
on
searches
and
seizures
states
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
primarily
designed
to
protect
the
individual
in
the
sanctity
of
his
home
and
the
privacy
of
his
books
and
papers
and
properties,
but
then
(inaudible)
goes
on
to
say
that
it
does
apply
to
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
adopted
in
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case.
now
the
little
case
which
seems
to
be
the
only
case
which
has
dropped
its
particular
points
to
this
court,
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
burton
which
was
agreed
to
by
mr.
justice
reed,
and
i
like
to
--
it's
a
small
dissent
and
in
that
case
they
dissented
on
the
factual
facts
and
that
we
are
agreed
to
in
the
majority
case
and
also
dissented
on
the
constitutional
point
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
district
of
columbia.
mr.
justice
burton
said,
in
my
opinion
the
duties
which
the
inspector
was
seeking
to
perform
under
the
authority
of
the
district
were
of
such
a
reasonable,
general
routine,
accepted
and
important
character
in
the
protection
of
the
public
health
and
safety
that
they
were
being
before
and
lawfully
without
a
search
warrant
and
as
this
required
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
protect
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
person,
house,
papers
and
effects,
and
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
minority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
written
by
judge
holsoff
also
found
that
it
was
not
unconstitutional
and
his
reason
was
that
the
requirements
for
a
search
warrant
apply
only
in
criminal
cases.
now
that
is
our
point
in
this
case
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
case.
the
evidence,
if
there
was
any
evidence
the
use
was
not
–
was
not
to
be
used
in
any
criminal
case
against
him.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
that,
that
is
not
really
point,
our
point
is
that
this
is
within
the
police
power,
and
therefore,
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
fourteenth
or
fourth
amendment
and
now
our
police
power
and
but
it
is
reasonable
and
therefore
essential
that
it
be
used
in
the
different
states
as
the
inspection
is
reasonable.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
sir,
it
wasn't
–
i
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
if
the
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
a
criminal
section
or
health?
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
criminal
section
–
i
do
not
believe
he
would
be
able
to
use
it
then.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well
my
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
that
he
could
use
it
insofar
as
the
need
for
the
notice
was
necessary
but
the
second
inspection
is
that
one
which
he
has
being
convicted
off
--
it's
the
fact
that
there
is
still
this
nuisance
there
and
that
will
be
the
conviction
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
sir,
that
is
correct.
there
would
have
to
be
the
first
inspection
and
the
notice.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
think
it's
supported
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
need
for
a
notice
to
be
sent,
but
whether
the
evidence
itself
was
necessary
to
be
before
the
court,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
go
that
far
beyond
the
notice
to
see
what
the
evidence
was
there.
but
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
support
a
conviction
because
you
must
have
notice
–-
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
--
that
there
was
a
nuisance
and
therefore
you
do
not,
you
have
to
a
chance
to
correct
it
in
30
days.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
he
would
be
supporting
insofar
as
i
say
i
think
it's
not
the
direct
support
for
the
conviction,
however,
it
is
one
of
those
elements
that
are
necessary
to
prove
before
he
could
be
convicted.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
believe
the
notice.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
the
notice
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
gave
him
a
notice
to
correct
it
and
if
it
were
there
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
believe
he
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
believe
he
could
do
it
without
investigating
the
house,
if
he
believed
there
was
a
nuisance
there.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well
in
this
case,
all
they
had
was
cause
to
suspect
that
a
nuisance
was
in
the
house.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
in
that
case
is
where
there
is
a
menace
really,
that
you
can
really
see
the
nuisance
without
--
i
mean
there
you
really
have
probable
cause
maybe
to
believe
that
a
nuisance
existed.
now
here
we
just
have
cause
to
suspect
a
nuisance
existed
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
believe
there
must
be
a
--
they
must
see
the
nuisance
in
order
to
send
the
notice
to
have
it
abated.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
he
must
see
it
or
smell
it
or
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
send
a
notice
out,
now
they
go
out
and
inspect
the
house
first
to
make
sure
i
believe.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
they
could
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
believe
they
could
send
the
notice
out
and
therefore
the
rats
--
they
would
have
to
get
rid
of
the
rats
and
if
they
were
there
in
30
days
then
he
could
be
convicted
on
that.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
they
could
but
i
don't
believe
that
as
a
policy
of
the
health
department.
they
of
course
only
send
notices
to
people
who
really
do
have
nuisances
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
within
a
block
urban
renewal
especially
where
the
house
this
is
(inaudible)
a
notice
is
wrapped
around
quite
a
bit
and
therefore
they
will
send
notices
that
they
know
that
there
are
rats
there
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
at
large
so
all
the
houses
in
the
block
to
clean
up
those
rats
and
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well
they
couldn't
arrest
you
without
knowing
they
are
in
your
house.
they
could
only
arrest
you
when
they
came
in
and
found
that.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
they
would
have
to
make
an
inspection
in
some
time
now
whether
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
same
problem
again.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
you
mean
against
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
sir,
they
have
no
right
to
go
in
and
check
the
premises,
and
under
the
ordinance.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
you
get
this
correct.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
search
of
the
premises,
but
as
you
can
see
they
did
have
cause
to
suspect.
the
pictures
and
the
record
will
show
you
the
condition
of
the
house
and
the
piles
of
(inaudible)
infestation
as
the
inspector
testified.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
housing
code
but
this
is
part
of
the
housing
bureau
i
believe
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
it
takes
in
part
of
the
health
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
but
there
you
too
comply
would
be
a
violation
of
the
code
and
also
–
yeah
i
believe
that
code
provides
for
inspection
as
in
the
health
case
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
--
and
building
and
that
was
in
givner
case,
givner
versus
state,
there
are
3
inspections
in
that
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
be
a
violation
of
the
code.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that
not
the
policy
but
that
is
law
that
the
ordinance,
under
the
ordinance
notice
must
sent
before
any
prosecution
can
be
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
mean
there
must
be
that
notice
set
forth
in
the
ordinance
itself,
but
a
notice
must
be
sent.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
yes
sir
there
is
a
comparable
law,
a
multiple
dwelling
law,
but
the
difference
there
is
that
this
is
a
private
residence
while
there
at
the
multiple
dwelling
there
were
more
than
one-family
residences,
and
might
be
a
little
different
as
to
whether
that
is
a
--
whether
it's
private
home
or
not,
that
there
might
be
a
difference
there
in
the
multiple
dwelling
houses.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
yeah
the
special
housing
magistrate
court.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
yes.
so
that
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
maryland
that
the
inspection
complained
of
here
is
in
the
police
power
and
that
the
exercise
of
that
police
power
was
reasonable
and
necessary
to
protect
the
public
health,
welfare
and
safety
of
the
people.
no
one
doubts
the
validity
of
protecting
the
right
of
privacy
and
is
not
to
be
denied
that
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
was
to
secure
privacy
in
the
home.
it
is
not
a
right
that
however
which
is
invalid
or
absolute,
especially
in
modern
living.
individual
freedom
must
yield
in
some
cases
to
the
enforcement
of
reasonable
regulations
for
public
welfare.
the
right
of
privacy
should
not
give
a
right
to
refuse
entry
to
a
health
inspector
anymore
than
the
right
to
free
speech,
gives
the
right
to
falsely
shout
fire
in
a
theatre,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
and
also
the
right
of
freedom
of
religion.
it
would
give
the
right
to
offer
a
human
sacrifice.
where
public
health
is
at
stake,
this
court
has
sanctioned
as
against
constitutional
objection
based
on
individual
right,
the
power
of
the
government
to
summarily
feed
and
enter
and
destroy
decayed
food,
and
that
was
in
the
north
american
cold
storage
and
chicago
case
311
us
or
the
power
to
provide
for
compulsory
vaccination
is,
that
was
in
jacobson
versus
massachusetts.
indeed
in
affirming
the
power
of
a
municipality
to
regulate
refuse
removal,
this
court
in
california
reduction
company
versus
sanitary
reduction
works
stated
that
a
householder
may
be
compelled
to
even
submit
to
an
inspection
of
his
own
premises,
that's
on
his
own
expense.
there
it
was
just
stated
in
opinion.
it
was
not
holding
of
the
case,
but
it
was
just
in
the
opinion
itself.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
the
north
american
case,
that
was
the
case
where
the
–-
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
north
american
cold
storage
and
–
versus
chicago,
211
us,
that
may
be
in
the
amici
curiae
case,
they
are
not
going
to
argue
so
therefore,
it
might
be
in
that
case.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
for
health
inspections,
i
really
don't
know
your
honor.
to
say
that
we
will
accept
certain
invasions
of
privacy
that
can
bar
the
entry
of
inspectors
who
enter
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
public
health
is
failing
to
have
balanced
the
conflicting
rights
in
accordance
with
their
relative
weight.
the
entrance
of
a
health
inspector
in
the
case
at
bar
was
for
the
protection
of
the
home
owner
as
well
as
the
community.
therefore,
the
choice
we
have
in
this
case
is
between
the
interest
of
privacy
and
the
interest
of
preserving
the
lives
and
the
health
of
the
citizens
of
baltimore
or
any
other
city.
what
are
the
interests
of
the
individual
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
we
think
its
1879
or
1873
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
and
most
of
the
cities
have
same
type
of
ordinances,
the
larger
cities
and
have
joined
us
as
amicus
curios.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
how
long
they
have
had
the
regulation,
but
ours
was
in
1875.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
not
that
i
know
of
–
i
mean
i
did
not
check
back
any
further
either
your
honor
but
1879
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that
is
true
your
honor
but
1879
it
would
be
the
earliest
that
i
know
of
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
yeah
i
don't
know
about
the
other
states
and
this
is
the
only
the
second
case
that's
really
come
up
in
the
state
of
maryland
concerning
at
this
point.
the
other
was
givener
versus
state,
which
did
not
come
to
this
court
after
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
can't
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
oh
it
would
be
more
than
5000.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
it
will
more
than
15,
there
is
a
million
people
just
about
in
baltimore
and
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
a
lot
of
them
(inaudible)
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well
then
they
would
be
subject
to
the
multiple
dwelling
law
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
--
the
two
family
or
3000
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
same
sanitary
things
exist
but
this
would
apply
to
public
residents,
this
particular
ordinance.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
was
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
that
was
--
no
that
was
a
seizure
of
--
no
that
was
taking
property
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
took
property
and
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
it
could
be
destroyed
even
or
they
could
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that's
right
yes
your
honor,
nothing
on
the
fourth
amendment.
but
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
really
i
can't
even
estimate
how
many
single
family
houses
we
have
involved
but
there
is
a
great
many
of
them
like
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
50,000.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
15?
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
50,
yeah
at
least.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
of
1879.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well,
the
history
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well,
that
was
i
just
getting
to
your
honor
that
it
should
be
noted
that
most
householders
feel
their
interest
lie
in
permitting
such
inspections
because
they
wish
to
find
out
exactly
what
is
wrong
with
their
house
so
they
can
correct
it
instead
of
having
it
burned
down
or
having
right
to
take
over
or
all
kind
of
animals
and
things
like
that
they
welcome
the
inspector
in
most
cases.
and
it
also
might
be
pointed
out
that
in
one
inspection
that
they
had
in
baltimore
in
an
urban
renewal
area,
had
564
inspections,
560
houses
had
violations,
health
violations
that
that
would
indicate
just
a
small
area
of
health
violation.
most
of
the
people
will
allow
the
health
inspector
in,
yet
one
of
the
ones
like
the
appellant
who
feels
differently
what
are
the
dangers
as
to
him?
now
unlike
the
householders
in
all
of
the
cases
in
this
court
were
search
had
been
declared
unconstitutional,
this
householder
is
subject
to
no
criminal
prosecution
as
such.
under
the
baltimore
city
code,
as
in
all
or
most
inspection
ordinances
if
a
health
or
safety
hazard
is
found,
the
householder
is
merely
notified
to
correct
it
and
a
penalty
attaches
only
if
he
fails
to
comply.
there
is
no
contention
in
the
instant
case
that
the
householder
was
harassed
by
repeated
inspection
nor
was
the
inspection
made
at
an
inconvenient
time.
the
ordinance
says
that
it
must
be
made
during
the
day
and
there
is
no
contention
that
the
inspector
had
any
other
motive
than
to
find
a
health
hazard.
he
was
inspecting
in
order
to
find
where
the
rats
were
that
were
in
the
block
and
might
go
into
other
houses
within
the
block.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
knock
on
the
door
in
the
middle
of
the
night
or
even
of
interference
with
a
family
dinner
hour.
i
am
sure
it's
been
the
practice
in
baltimore
that
if
health
inspector
comes
to
your
house
and
you
don't
wish
to
let
him
be
him
in
at
that
time,
for
some
reason,
they
will
then
come
back
another
day.
i
mean
it
isn't
one
of
those
things
that
they
won't
come
back
tomorrow,
that
the
wife
is
busy,
doing
something
else.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
they
have
the
right
to
but
i
will
say
it's
been
the
policy
of
the
city
of
baltimore.
now
the
(inaudible)
inspection
of
the
appellants
property
within
refines
to
a
complaint
as
to
a
neighbors
out.
now
i
would
like
to
emphasis
that
this
was
not
a
complaint
from
a
neighbor
about
this
house.
it
was
a
complaint
as
to
a
neighbors
house.
she
said
she
had
rats
in
her
house
and
she
want
to
know
where
they
are
coming
from.
she
just
trying
to
rat
proof
it
and
got
one
of
the
rats
in
after
its
rat
proofed,
so
she
didn't
want
anymore
of
that
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well
i
don't
know
if
its
100
percent
but
she
still
might
have
been.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
(inaudible)
that's
correct,
that's
the
most
growing
animal,
i
guess
you
must
have
internal
vigilance.
and
it
was
suggested
that
a
search
warrant
to
be
upended
in
this
case.
now
in
maryland
where
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
a
crime
is
being
committed
then
you
can
get
a
search
warrant,
but
in
this
particular
case
where
all
you
have
cause
to
suspect
a
nuisance
and
not
a
crime,
it's
not
crime,
just
to
have
a
nuisance
in
effect,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
also
that
search
warrant
would
be
not
be
able
to
be
issued
under
the
present
laws
of
the
state
of
maryland.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
mean
there
is
some
doubt,
now
there
is
some
doubt.
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
would
be
doubt
as
to
whether
a
search
warrant,
would
issue
in
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
on
your
present
statute.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
it
probably
–
it
would
be
a
crime
if
you
could
show
probable
cause
that
a
person
with
(inaudible)
a
nuisance
but
here
we
just
have
cause
to
suspect
and
therefore
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
would
say
it
would
be
a
crime
in
maryland
maintenance
of
a
public
nuisance.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
we
have
the
common
–
we
keep
the
new
common
law
except
where
it's
been
changed
statute,
so
i
believe
that
it
would
be
under
the
common
law
i
know
of
no
statute.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
really
don't
know
how
many
refused
but
i
can
tell
you
that
it
hasn't
been
very
many.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
most
people
would
welcome
it,
but
i
think
if
this
court
would
take
the
position
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
health
inspector
to
come
into
your
house
then
a
lot
of
the
people
may
take
a
different
attitude
and
they
require
that
search
warrants
be
issued
in
order
to
protect
themselves
they
might
say
but
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
think
the
need
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
if
search
warrants
were
required
i
mean
if
it
were
required,
it
would
be
required
more
so.
you
couldn't
go
back
past
history,
because
if
this
court
like
i
said,
if
this
court
took
the
position
that
if
they
were
required
and
i
am
sure
that
more
people
that
would
allow
them
in
under
the
present
law
would
then
take
a
different
position
and
ask
that
we
get
a
search
warrant.
so
i
don't
think
past
history
is
going
to
really
tell
us
too
much
because
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
almost,
just
about
it.
it
would
be
for
periodic
inspections
of
every
house.
i
mean
where
they
make
inspections
of
the
blocks,
different
blocks.
i
mean
not
by
compliant
such
as
here.
here
it
was
by
compliant
and
therefore
it
would
be
a
little
different
than
where
they
make
a
periodic
inspection
of
each
block
and
--
in
baltimore
i
am
afraid
to
say
that
there
hasn't
been
too
much
of
that
periodic
inspection
because
they
have
had
too
many
complaints.
it
takes
all
the
people
that
are
available
in
the
housing
bureau
and
in
health
department
they
take
care
of
the
complaints
that
come
in
and
therefore
they
are,
that's
what
followed
up
in
the
present
time.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
they
could,
they
could
be
gotten
from
the
health
department
and
however
i
do
have
or
amicus
curiae
brief
does
have
a
figure
from
new
york
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
maryland
i
didn't
have
them
available
at
the
time,
but
it
could
be
gotten.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
they
could
be
gotten,
like
i
said,
i
pointed
out
that
in
the
givner
case
they
did
recite
some
figures
i
think
it
was
564
inspections
and
they
found
violations,
health
violations
in
560
houses.
that
was
in
the
givner
case,
that
was
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
560
out
of
564,
in
fact
and
there
was
four
houses
without
a
violation.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
yes
sir,
prosecutions
and
also
how
many
inspections
there
have
been
in
the
past
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
year
and
how
many
violations
came
about
in
that
inspection.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
at
the
maximum.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
imprisonment,
just
a
fine
of
$20.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
givner
case
pointed
out
that
a
search
warrant,
there
might
be
some
valid
whether
search
warrant
would
be
available
under
the
present
statute.
this
of
course
would
not
prove
that
a
search
warrant
is
unnecessary,
but
it
does
tend
to
support
the
rather
restricted
common
law
concept
of
the
office
of
the
search
warrant
and
that
was
probably
in
the
minds
of
those
who
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution
what
they
had
in
mind
was
criminal
prosecution.
therefore
we
believe
that
as
was
pointed
to
judge
--
to
mr.
justice
black
that
even
if
a
search
warrant
were
provided
in
maryland
statutes
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
necessary
and
in
the
overwhelming
cases
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
health
inspector
to
show
the
probable
cause,
cause
to
suspect
is
the
little
less
than
probable
cause
we
believe
and
even
that
its
kind
of
hard
sometimes
to
gain
and
train,
but
probable
cause
you
would
have
to
have
more
than
cause
to
suspect
than
would
be
kind
of
far
to
–
for
a
health
inspector
to
obtain
that
information
before
making
an
entry.
it
is
not
only
a
question
of
inconvenience
involved
in
the
pre-curium
warrant
though,
the
fact
is
that
the
public
health
can
not
be
protected
merely
by
following
up
the
warrantful
complaints.
the
major
public
health
and
safety
program
in
the
country
is
grounded
on
the
concept
that
it
is
true
prevention
of
the
conditions
which
result
in
health
and
safety
hazards
and
not
in
the
punishment
of
the
violators.
now
that
i
think
is
very
important
because
we
do
not
want
to
punish
these
violators
who
will
not
let
us
in
or
who
has
nuisances.
the
idea
is
that
these
nuisances
be
cleaned
up
and
it
is
necessary
that
they
be
done
for
the
community
itself
and
i
believe
it
was
stated
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
bermon
case,
bermon
versus
clark,
parker
and
urban
renewal
cases
that
if
the
it
is
necessary
in
for
the
morale
of
the
people
that
these
urban
renewal
projects
be
given
the
go
ahead.
now
a
reversal
of
the
decision
of
this
court,
of
the
maryland
court
in
this
case
would
destroy
that
system
of
preventative
inspection
now
set
up
throughout
the
country.
now
this
is
stated
in
amici
curiae
brief
is
necessary
throughout
the
country
in
the
los
angeles,
new
york
and
most
of
the
bigger
cities
and
smaller
cities
alike.
it
would
make
the
health
officer
mere
process
servers
for
the
purpose
of
abating
conditions
which
already
have
grown
to
the
stature
of
a
public
menace,
now
that's
the
one
that
you
would
get
a
warrant
for,
the
ones
you
can
smell,
the
ones
you
can
hear
and
see
or
something
like
that.
you
know,
if
you
see
rats
at
the
window,
you
could
get
probably
cause
if
you
got
rats
in
there,
but
--
or
and
it
might
be
dead
rats
you
have
to
smell
them
to
show
probably
cause.
so
that's
what
the
health
officer
would
turn
out
--
they
would
be
a
mere
process
server.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
they
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that's
true,
that's
true.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that's
true
and
you
might
think
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that's
true
your
honor
you
might
say
that
there
is
probably
rats
in
there
and
there
might
be
squirrels
or
some
other
animal
in
the
house.
but
i
think
as
i
said
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
grand
jury
surveys
that
were
made
in
new
york
city
and
referred
to
by
the
national
institute
of
municipal
law
officers
on
page
5
of
their
brief,
that
a
report
showed
that
an
inspection
team
surveyed
15
square
blocks
of
housing
and
three
representative
areas
of
brooklyn
in
which
567
housing
division
violations
had
previously
been
reported
on
complaints.
now
the
inspection
survey
revealed
an
actual
total
of
12,445
violations
in
the
test
area.
many
of
them
classed
as
hazardous.
other
inspections
in
the
new
york
area
indicated
that
the
ratio
was
not
out
of
line.
now
only
567
violations
on
file
prior
to
inspection
as
against
12,445
violations,
can
there
be
any
doubt
of
a
need
for
preventative
inspection?
we
believe
that
there
is
this
need
for
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
very
good
indication
there
that
this
law
if
the
court,
i
mean
it
seem
what
the
court
does
say
about
that
present
law,
a
cause
to
suspect
it
maybe
that
it
might
be
best
in
the
--
advantageous
to
say
that
they
can
inspect
any
house.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
and
that
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
assuming
what
the
court
would
do
here
of
course
unless
what
they
might
fit
about
--
but
i
think
that
that
is
true
and
i
might
point
out
that
most
of
the
city
allow
inspections
in
any
house
and
not
restricted
to
cause
to
suspect
such
as
we
have
here.
whereas
that
the
older
type
and
the
newer
type
i
believe
allow
inspections
in
every
house,
but
harris
cause
to
suspect
ordinance.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
routine
inspections
probably,
i
think
most
of
the
bigger
cities
have
that
and
that's
just
been
adopted
recently
though
and
ours
is
more
limited
of
course
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
imagine
that
they
would
have
to
go
to
court
in
order
to
–
they
couldn't
get
a
search
warrant
your
honor
therefore
they
might
condemn
the
house
or
something
like
that,
but
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
but
i
believe
that
–
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
believe
that
if
this
court
there
upholds
the
constitution
--
constitutionality
of
this
act,
i
am
sure
that
you
will
let
the
city
of
baltimore
in
and
the
reason
it
has
–
and
i
am
sure
is
to
find
out
if
it
is
constitutional
but
if
the
court
says
its
constitutional
he
is
going
to
let
them
in
i
am
sure.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
well
then
just
go
back
again
the
next
day
and
another
$20
fine
and
next
day
another
$20
and
$20
per
refusal
or
per
day.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that's
the
only
thing
that
i
know
of.
now
there
maybe
another
procedure
that
i
really
don't
know
because
i
am
not
familiar
with
all
the
health
procedures
but
there
maybe
and
now
there
that
they
could
get
in
but
i
would
say
that
they
could
go
back
to
next
day
and
getting
to
refuse
again.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
now
i
believe
that
as
stated
in
the
national
institute
of
municipal
law's
brief
and
they
put
it
very
well.
they
say
a
man's
house
may
be
his
castle,
but
that
castle
no
longer
sits
on
a
hill
surrounded
by
a
moat.
the
modern
"castle"
is
connected
to
a
central
water
system,
a
sewage
system,
a
garbage
collection
system
and
frequently
to
the
houses
on
either
side
and
i
think
that
really
points
out
the
need
for
these
inspections
in
modern
time
that
the
houses
are
getting
to
be
so
close
together,
row
houses,
that
your
house
is
really
a
something
that
a
community
should
watch
out
for
because
if
you
have
rats
they
can
get
over
to
your
house,
if
you
are
in
a
row
house,
its
like
poring
a
hole
right
through
the
wall.
mr.

that
was
from
the
brief
of
the
amici
curiae
and
i
thought
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
very
well
put
--
mr.
james

norris,

although
the
question
presented
in
this
case
has
not
been
decided
about
this
court,
similar
cases
have
been
before
the
state
court.
now
in
maryland
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
givner
case,
held
that
the
ordinances
of
baltimore
city
which
provided
for
inspections
without
search
warrants
by
the
health
department,
building
inspector
engineer
and
fire
department
of
buildings
for
the
purpose
of
performing
their
prescribed
duty
was
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power.
the
court
further
held
that
the
inspections
were
not
unreasonable
and
therefore
were
not
unlawful.
they
did
not
then
involve
any
violation
of
article
26
of
the
maryland
declaration
of
right,
similar
to
the
fourth
amendment
or
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
was
held
in
givner
case
decided
in
1956.
in
south
carolina
this
court
in
richards
versus
city
of
columbia
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
an
ordinance
directed
at
the
improvement
of
housing.
although
the
question
of
entry
was
not
before
the
court
at
that
time,
they
expressed
some
doubt
whether
such
an
entry
would
come
within
the
constitutional
guarantees
against
unreasonable
searches
and
they
then
referred
to
the
divided
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
united
states,
the
district
of
columbia
and
this
court
in
the
little
case.
in
ohio,
which
the
supreme
court
in
state
versus
pike
and
which
i
believe
an
appeal
to
this
court
and
now
is
699
on
the
docket,
held
that
the
inviolability
of
homeowner's
counsel
is
subordinate
to
the
general
health
and
safety
of
the
community
where
he
lives.
the
court
further
held
that
the
dayton
ordinance
authorizing
housing
inspectors
to
enter
upon
premises
and
examines
the
premise
of
any
reasonable
power,
did
not
violate
the
section
of
the
ohio
constitution
prohibiting
unreasonable
searches.
a
recent
note
in
72
harvard
law
review,
discusses
urban
renewal
and
there
the
article
goes
into
the
problem
of
inspections
and
suggests
that
authorization
by
municipal
housing
codes
of
entry
upon
property
for
inspection
without
a
warrant
maybe
open
to
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
they
state
that
the
court
should
uphold
the
housing
code
inspections
without
warrants
on
the
ground
that
the
search
is
not
for
the
purpose
of
securing
evidence
of
criminal
guilt
and
further
states
that
a
search
for
inspection
purposes
should
be
deemed
unreasonable
only
if
conducted
in
an
oppressive
way.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
the
state
constitution,
they
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
ruled
out
the
fourth
amendment,
after
they
--
and
then
therefore
they
were
just
deciding
on
the
ohio
constitution.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
search?
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
oh
i
believe
we
carry
with
it
the
right
to
punish,
i
mean
the
right
to
search
or
inspect
i
should
say,
where
there
is
call
to
suspect.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
no
sir,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
what
i
mean
is
that
it
would
uphold
the
right
of
the
state
to
punish
those
who
refuse
to
allow
--
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
oh
no
it
would
not
carry
that
but
it
would
carry
the
fact
that
it
would
be
lawful
for
the
–
for
the
state
to
punish
anyone
who
lawfully
refused,
but
it
would
not
allow
the
person
to
go
right
in
and
bust
in.
mr.
james
h.
norris,
jr.
that's
what
it
amounts
to
and
i
believe
the
attorney
general
sybert
would
like
to
say
and
summarize
the
remarks.
