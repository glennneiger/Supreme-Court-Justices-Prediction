justice

m.
harlan
it
was
required
here.
you
concede
that
the
information
that
the
health
officer
had
would
have
sufficient
to
justify
the
issuance
of
a
warrant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
supposing
he
had
gone
to
a
magistrate,
what
would
have
been
your
position
as
--
and
a
warrant
had
issued
on
this
information,
what
would
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
if
he
had
gone
before
a
magistrate
and
the
magistrate
had
issued
a
warrant,
do
you
claim
that
the
information
was
inadequate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
i
was
wondering
was
whether
apart
from
the
constitutional
questions
that
you
are
raising,
you
are
making
a
claim
here
that
the
information
on
which
this
officer
acted
was
inadequate
under
the
statute
to
justify
his
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
maryland
has
(inaudible)
requiring
every
householder
to
(inaudible)
as
it's
automatically
once
a
year?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
figures
to
show
how
many
of
these
inspections
are
(inaudible)
in
the
city
of
baltimore?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
think
that
a
tax
assessor
who
wants
to
come
in
to
appraise
your
house,
you
personal
property
should
have
a
search
warrant
to
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
they
cut
off
the
water
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
wonderful
choice,
your
answer
is
very
helpful
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
(inaudible)
just
give
health
officer
right
to
enter
premises
if
there
is
a
refusal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
this
man
refused
and
if
you
refused
this
then
have
your
officers
got
a
right
to
go
in
and
check
the
premises?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
understood.
