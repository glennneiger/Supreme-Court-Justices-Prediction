justice
hugo
l.
black
that
followed
did
it
not,
a
statement
that
what
she
has
done
there
was
to
claim
under
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
should
never,
and
that
was
all
she
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
your
case
depends
of
findings
of
the
fourth
amendment,
protection
of
no
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
except
one
that
you
argue
that
you
have
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
wouldn't
claim
of
course
if
he
went
in
there
as
health
officer
and
found
something
he
thought
was
unhealthy
and
he
just
grabbed
it
all
and
took
it
out,
that
that
would
be
reasonable
seizure,
just
simply
because
it
was
not
a
criminal
reference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
you
are
going
to
â€“
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
north
american
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
it
in
the
briefs,
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
question
of
search
and
seizure,
it
was
a
search,
an
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
anything
else
in
the
north
american
case,
are
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
was
there
any
question
raised
there
about
the
search
without
a
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
took
the
property
and
held
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
but
they
could
sue
for
it
(inaudible)
they
have
been
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
be
destroyed
and
suit
--
but
suit
could
be
brought?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
the
right
to
disallow
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say
they
found
a
way
in
baltimore
to
eradicate
of
100
percent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
so
i
has
a
little
curiosity
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
if
you
know
approximately
how
many
people
have
refused
in
baltimore
to
permit
the
inspection
in
the
last
ten
years,
how
big
is
the
count?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
ask
you
that
because
may
be
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
real
issue
(inaudible)
or
may
it
has,
you
said
that
you
had
to
choose
the
men
enforcing
you
a
health
code
and
permitting
searches
without
warrants,
has
there
been
any
such
refusal
that
indicate
to
you
did
require
a
warrant
as
in
the
case
of
this
man
and
just
to
be
a
few,
i
would
have
told
myself
what
you
said
most
people
would
welcome
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
statistics
if
we
gather
them
now
would
be
worthwhile
in
determining
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
how
important
it
would
be
in
the
future,
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
search
warrants
were
required.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
from
your
stand
point
then
or
from
the
standpoint
of
the
amicus
people
who
filed
here,
you
are
going
on
the
theory
that
if
such
warrant
should
be
required
it
might
bring
about
such
a
change,
that
the
problem
would
be
almost
inside
it,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
challenging
a
variation.
