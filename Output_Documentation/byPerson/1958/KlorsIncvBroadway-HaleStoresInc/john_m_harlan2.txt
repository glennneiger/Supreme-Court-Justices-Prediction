is
it
a
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
or
of
the
propriety
advantage
over
a
judgment?
justice
john
m.

even
though
that
this
is
introduction
of
a
new
concept
and
new
antitrust
laws,
this
opinion
is
after
all
written
by
a
judge
who
was
having
antitrust
provision
or
is
it
a
question
of
his
misinterpreting
the
allegations

i
ask
you
question

would
it
be
open
under
this
complaint
for
klor's
to
show

that
this
alleged
conspiracy
had
eventuated
as
a
result
of
their
price
cutting
and
ergo
--
the
public
therefore
had
been
deprived
of
klor's
of
the
source.
we're
getting
these
materials,
these
appliances
at
a
lower
price
would,
it
be
open
under
the
complain
to
show
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
--
let
me
anticipate
the
question.
assuming
that
it
were
open,
would
that
in
your
judgment
stated
--
make
out
a
case
under
the
sherman
act.
justice

then
why

then
go
ahead
and
tell
me
why
that
hasn't
opened
and
approved
under
the
complaint.
justice
john
m.

is
the
reason
for
