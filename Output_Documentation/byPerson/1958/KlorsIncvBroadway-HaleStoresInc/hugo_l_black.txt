mr.
elman,
is
this
--
bring
this
down
locally.
i
think
i
can
understand
it
better
your
--
your
viewpoint.
is
this
the
same
in
your
judgment
as
to
a
suit
filed
by
one
of
the
locals
here
alleging
the
large
number
of
wholesale
distributors
and
combined
together
to
refuse
to
sell
him
any
of
their
products,
has
been
buying
him
a
long
time
and
sold
and
retailed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
because
there
are
other
people
besides
woodward
&
lothrop
here
who
can
sell
those
things
in
retail,
that
the
public
interest
is
not
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
kershner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean,
but
that
was
the
--
the
side.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
meant
it
was
kershner
in
the
sense
that
it
was
a
little
fellow.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
the
complaint
show
whether
he's
cutting
prices
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
aimed
at
21
of
those
43,
would
the
case
be
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
it
goes
on
the
--
perhaps
determinant
on
the
basis
of
how
much
competition
is
cut
off.
how
many
--
how
many
traders
are
cut
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
had
been
held
several
times.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
wondering.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
kiefer-stewart
says
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
contract
or
agreement
or
refuse
to
sell.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
have
to
assume
that
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
--
may
--
may
i
just
ask
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
take
up
your
time.
but
it
happens
that
i
wrote
this
opinion,
it
was
unanimous
opinion.
when
which
this
per
se,
that
--
that's
what
i'd
like
to
ask
you
--
they
keep
us
to
him
but
the
sherman
act
makes
it
an
offense
for
respondents
to
agree
among
themselves
to
stop
selling
to
the
people
or
customers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
you
know
as
--
as
if
there's
something
that
qualifies
it
while
you
should
read
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
submit
that
would
be
an
improper
interpretation
of
the
sherman
act.
