mr.
maxwell
keith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
intend
to
take
20
or
25
minutes
in
my
opening
statement.
mr.
elman
from
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
tends
to
take
about
half
an
hour
and
i
intend
to
reserve
five
or
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
maxwell
keith
this
is
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
district
court
below
had
granted
the
respondents
here
and
the
defendants
below
motion
to
dismiss
an
antitrust
complaint
and
for
summary
judgment.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
entry
of
a
judgment
against
the
plaintiff
petitioner
here
dismissing
the
complaint
and
for
summary
judgment.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
antitrust
laws
has
a
charter
of
economic
liberty,
protect
the
single
trader
from
conduct
prohibited
under
the
antitrust
laws.
specifically
in
this
case,
it
is
whether
or
not
the
single
trader
is
entitled
to
be
protected
from
conspiracies
designed
to
suppress
and
eliminate
his
competition.
and
whether
or
not
he
is
entitled
to
be
free
of
the
exercise
of
monopoly
power
designed
to
suppress
and
eliminate
his
competition.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
which
gives
the
private
party
the
right
to
sue
for
anything
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
laws
is
subject
to
a
judicial
imposition,
a
judicial
requirement
that
the
private
trader
in
addition
to
showing
personal
injury
as
it
is
--
as
is
required
by
section
4,
also
prove
or
convince
--
convince
the
judiciary
that
the
conduct
which
violates
an
act
of
congress
also
has
a
conceivably
injurious
impact
on
the
public.
the
petitioner
here
was
a
retailer
of
household
appliances,
radio,
television
sets,
washers
and
driers
and
other
miscellaneous
household
appliances,
stoves
and
refrigerators.
he
was
located
in
the
mission
district
in
san
francisco.
the
mission
district
in
san
francisco
is
well
known
in
the
appliance
and
furniture
industry
as
an
importance
feat
for
the
retailing
of
these
products.
san
francisco
of
course
is
a
very
important
area
of
interstate
trade
and
commerce.
it
is
the
third
or
fourth
largest
consumer
area
in
united
states.
the
respondent
broadway-hale
is
a
competitor
--
was
a
competitor
of
petitioner
klor's
inc.
and
it
is
specifically
alleged
in
the
complaint
in
paragraph
8,
that
the
defendant
hale
operates
a
chain
of
key
stores
in
the
westcoast
area
of
the
united
states.
it
enjoys
a
monopolistic
buying
power
by
reason
of
the
large
number
of
retail
outlets
it
operates.
it
has
used
its
monopolistic
buying
power
to
negotiate
terms
and
conditions
of
acquisition
and
purchase
of
the
products
manufactured,
distributed
and
sold
by
the
manufacturer-distributor
defendants.
the
other
respondents
are
manufacturers
of
household
appliances.
they
are
large,
powerful
intrastate
corporations.
they
are
well-known,
i'm
sure,
to
this
court.
they
are
radio
corporation
of
america
or
rca,
general
electric
company,
admiral
corporation,
zenith
radio
corporation,
emerson
radio
and
phonograph
corporation,
philco
corporation,
whirlpool
zeiger
corporation,
olympic
radio
and
television
inc,
tappan
stove
company,
rheem
manufacturing
company.
these
are
named
to
the
complaint
along
with
their
affiliated
or
wholly
owned
subsidiary
distributors
which
distribute
these
household
appliances
in
the
san
francisco
area.
admiral
--
admiral

zenith
h.
r.
basford

general

--
general
electric
distributing
corporation,
olympic
--
olympic
television
of
northern
california,
tappan,
o'keefe
&
merritt.
now,
this
complaint
alleges
that
these
respondents
conspired
each
with
the
other
to
suppress
and
eliminate
the
competition
of
klor's
petitioner
in
favor
of
broadway-hale.
it
alleges
therefore
that
there
was
a
common
unity
of
purpose
to
suppress
klor's
competition
in
favor
of
hale.
and
specifically
in
paragraph
6
(g)
of
the
complaint,
it
is
said
that
they
have
permitted
hale
to
enjoy
monopolistic
position
in
the
sale
and
distribution
of
the
products.
so
i
think
it
may
be
fairly
said
giving
the
complaint
all
of
the
inferences
and
all
of
the
construction
that
should
be
rendered
to
it
that
this
complaint
involved
a
conspiracy
to
refuse
to
sell
products
to
klor's
inc
in
order
to
suppress
his
competition
to
a
competitor,
in
other
words,
to
interfere
with
the
competitors
market.
alleges
a
conspiracy
for
a
time
to
discriminate
against
the
petitioner,
klor,
in
favor
of
the
respondent
broadway-hale.
in
other
words
to
interfere
with
the
free
and
open
competitive
market.
it
alleges
that
there
was
a
common
purpose
and
a
plan
here
to
allow
broadway-hale
a
monopolistic
position
in
the
sale
of
the
respondents'
merchandise.
and
i
think
she
clearly
alleges
that
broadway-hale
used
its
monopolistic
chain
buying
power
to
suppress
and
eliminate
the
competition
of
the
petitioner.
and
i
think
it
raises
fact
showing
a
specific
intent
by
broadway-hale
to
monopolize
the
retailing
of
household
appliances
in
the
san
francisco
area.
it
has
specifically
alleged
that
broadway-hale
refused
to
do
business
as
a
chain
buyer
utilizing
the
entire
strength
of
its
many
stores
with
the
respondent
unless
they
did
not
do
business
with
klor's.
these
allegations
are
uncontested
in
this
proceeding.
the
respondents
filed
no
answer
controverting
these
allegations.
they
filed
rather
hybrid
affidavits
in
summary
judgments.
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
think
that
the
judgment
is
on
both
grounds
your
honor.
the
judgment
rendered
by
the
district
court
was
both
on
the
--
based
upon
the
lack
of
cause
of
action
and
was
based
upon
the
lack
of
facts
to
show
issues
between
the
parties
under
the
antitrust
laws.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
affidavit
in
summary
judgments
showed
the
courts
below
that
there
was
indeed
a
group
refusal
to
deal.
the
affidavit
showed
two
things.
number
one,
that
there
were
a
number
of
other
competitors
in
the
san
francisco
area.
they
were
merely
names
set
forth
on
a
piece
of
paper.
they
showed
that
there
are
a
lot
of
these
competitors
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area.
and
number
two,
they
showed
that
there
were
other
brand
names
available
to
the
petitioner
here
other
than
the
respondents
named
in
the
complaint.
but
they
also
showed
as
you
go
through
the
record
as
to
each
affidavit
filed
by
each
respondent
that
there
was
no
delivery
of
their
merchandise
to
klor
in
the
supposedly
competitive
market.
there
was
no
explanation
advanced,
no
justification,
no
reason
given
why
klor
was
not
receiving
this
merchandise.
there
were
no
other
forms
of
discovery
used.
there
were
no
depositions
filed,
no
request
for
admissions,
no
interrogatories,
no
settlement
of
pretrial
issues
under
rule
16.
in
short,
all
that's
we
have
are
these
hybrid
affidavit
in
summary
judgment.
based
upon
this
record
showing
this
group
refusal
to
deal,
this
uncontested
allegations
of
monopolistic
chain
buying
power.
the
lower
court
said,
“there
was
no
substantiality
either
in
law
or
in
substance
to
exercise
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
single
trader.”
and
this
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
showing
of
public
injury.
and
by
this,
i
take
it
to
mean
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
limited
in
their
purpose
and
scope
to
showing
conduct
which
has
a
direct
injurious
effect
on
the
public
such
as
price
fixing
and
some
other
type
of
conduct
upon
which
there's
a
direct
effect
on
the
consumer
or
the
public.
this
decision
was
made
after
this
court
had
ruled
in
the
radovich
case
that
the
doctrine
of
public
injury
as
used
by
the
court
below
has
no
application
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
this
issue
was
specifically
before
the
court
in
the
radovich
case,
that
is
radovich
versus
national
football
league
because
the
ninth
circuit
below
had
held
that
there
--
that
the
facts
in
the
complaint
showed
no
conceivable
injury
to
the
public,
no
prejudice
to
the
public.
the
writ
involved
this
question
of
public
injury.
and
this
court
specifically
met
the
problem
and
stated
in
the
opinion
that
when
congress
passes
an
act,
the
violation
of
that
act
itself
creates
a
public
wrong
and
that
the
antitrust
laws
protect
the
victims
of
forbidden
conduct
as
well
as
the
public.
the
decision
below
is
clearly
erroneous
for
three
reasons.
number
one,
it
is
an
improper
interpretation
of
the
scope
and
the
purposes
and
the
objectives
of
the
antitrust
laws.
number
two,
it
refused
to
apply
the
rule
of
this
court
that
group
boycotts
to
or
group
refusal
to
deal
are
illegal
per
se.
and
that
the
mere
entry
into
this
agreement
is
forbidden
conduct.
and
third,
to
refuse
to
give
to
an
antitrust
complaint
and
an
antitrust
litigant
the
most
elementary
rules
of
federal
civil
procedure,
construction
of
a
complaint
in
favor
of
the
private
litigant,
construction
of
the
complaint
to
see
what
maybe
offered
to
prove
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
now,
as
to
the
first
contention
of
error,
the
antitrust
laws
of
course
protect
the
public
from
predatory
conduct
or
from
conduct
which
is
designed
to
gouge
them
of
--
of
a
dollar.
but
clearly,
this
is
not
the
only
purpose
and
objective
of
the
congress
in
--
in
enacting
the
antirust
laws
and
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
we
may
pickup
the
attorney
general's
national
committee
to
study
the
antitrust
laws
and
turn
to
the
very
first
page
of
this
report
and
see
the
heading,
“a
policy
against
undo
limitations
or
competitive
conditions.”
and
--
and
read
the
statement,
“the
general
objective
of
the
antitrust
law
does
promotion
of
competition
in
open
markets.
this
policy
is
a
primary
feature
of
private
enterprise.
most
americans
have
long
recognized
that
opportunity
for
market
access
and
fostering
of
market
rivalry
are
basic
tenants
of
our
faith
and
compettion
as
a
form
of
economical
organization.”
someone
is
--
that
the
antitrust
law
has
act
to
prohibit
conduct
which
unduly
limits
competitive
opportunity.
and
this
is
regardless
of
any
effect
on
the
public
any
direct
effect.
the
public
is
protected
by
having
every
trader
that
wants
to
get
into
the
market
place
compete
for
that
consumer
by
special
--
by
using
his
ingenuity,
his
ability
and
his
skills
in
the
market
place.
and
i
think
when
we're
talking
in
terms
of
substance,
we
have
to
get
down
to
the
very
core
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
that
very
core
is
that
every
man
in
this
country
has
an
opportunity
to
go
upon
the
market,
and
to
obtain
profits,
and
to
obtain
the
right
to
let
his
abilities
and
ingenuities
and
skills
determine
whether
or
not
he
shall
succeed
or
fail.
the
proper
proposition
is
set
forth,
vest
by
senator
sherman
when
he
discussed
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
act.
it
is
the
right
of
every
man
to
work
labor
and
produce
in
any
lawful
vocation,
and
to
transport
his
production
on
equal
terms
and
conditions
under
a
like
circumstances.
this
is
industrial
liberty
and
lies
at
the
foundation
of
the
equality
of
all
rights
and
privileges.
i
submit
that
when
congress
passed
the
antitrust
laws,
it
enacted
this
policy
as
far
as
the
constitutional
power
over
interstate
commerce
could
go.
that
every
man
should
be
free
of
conspiracies
in
the
use
of
monopoly
power
when
he
enters
into
a
free
and
open
market.
and
they
submitted
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
not
faced
this
issue,
has
not
faced
the
issue
of
the
right
of
the
single
trader
to
be
free
of
predatory
conduct
directed
at
suppressing
and
eliminating
his
competition.
secondly,
the
court
erred
because
it
did
not
apply
the
per
se
rule
of
group
refusal
to
deal.
this
course
--
this
court
has
stated
many
times
that
a
group
refusal
to
deal
is
in
--
is
illegal
per
se.
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
face
this
rule
even
though
these
affidavits
disclosed
a
uniform
refusal
to
deal.
but
what
is
meant
by
per
se
illegality?
it
has
meant
that
the
very
entry
into
the
agreements
is
illegal
per
se,
is
illegal
conduct,
is
forbidden
by
an
act
of
congress,
cannot
be
added
into
without
raising
a
private
or
a
government
case.
mr.
maxwell
keith
the
entry
into
an
agreement
by
a
group
to
refuse
to
deal
is
illegal
conduct.
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
think
a
fair
construction
of
the
complaint,
your
honor,
alleges
a
conspiracy
to
refuse
to
deal.
it
says
that
each
of
these
respondents
conspired
each
with
the
other.
and
then
it
alleges
they
have
refused
to
accept
the
business.
they
have
refused
to
accept
the
business
other
than
to
sell
their
product
to
plaintiff
while
freely
selling
their
products
to
hale.
now
then,
when
it
talks
--
when
it
goes
into
the
monopoly
power
of
hale
in
section
8
of
the
complaint,
i
just
read
to
you
from
section
6.
then
it
says,
“hale
use
its
monopoly
power
to
condition
its
sales
and
purchases
on
condition
that
the
respondent
did
not
sell
to
klor.”
but
clearly,
there
is
allegation
here
that
there
was
a
group
refusal
to
deal,
a
conspiracy
each
with
the
other.
and
as
this
court
has
held
recently
in
the
northern
pacific
railway
case,
in
the
kiefer-stewart
case,
in
the
times-picayune
case,
this
is
a
legal
conduct
and
it
is
not
sanctioned
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
maxwell
keith
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
affidavits
were
submitted
to
support
a
legal
proposition
that
there
was
no
public
injury.
now,
whereas
the
contention
as
i
understand
it
of
the
respondents
is
that
even
though
we
have
engaged
in
forbidden
conduct,
we
have
a
legal
defense
that
our
conduct
does
not
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
public.
it
doesn't
go
whether
the
question
that
the
public
is
able
to
--
not
able
to
buy
from
klor
because
of
this
conduct,
does
not
able
to
get
the
advantages
of
klor's
competition.
and
i
think
when
you
analyze
that,
it
comes
down
to
the
proposition
that
the
only
conduct
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
laws
are
agreements
to
fix
the
price
of
commodity,
that
is
somehow
to
gouge
the
public
by
fixing
a
high
price.
we
--
this
court
has
held
in
the
--
in
the
mckesson
&
robbins
case,
exactly
what
it
means
by
per
se
illegality.
it
says
that
per
se
legality
means
that
the
agreement
itself,
the
entry
into
the
agreement
is
illegal
regardless
of
--
specifically
regardless
of
market
control
and
specifically
regardless
of
whether
the
prices
fixed
are
low
or
high.
the
court
might
recall
that
the
keifer-stewart
case
involved
a
situation
where
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
refuse
to
deal
in
order
to
support
price
contracts.
and
the
--
the
agreement
there
was
to
prevent
the
retailers
from
setting
too
high
a
price.
the
--
the
it's
the
entry
into
the
agreement
and
this
is
because
the
entry
in
agreement
to
fix
the
price
means
the
entry
--
means
the
power
to
fix
a
high
or
a
low
price.
so
that
the
issue
is
not
the
effect
on
the
public.
the
issue
is,
what
is
the
conduct
to
this
condemned
by
the
antitrust
laws
in
view
of
all
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
congress.
now
lastly,
the
court
erred
in
--
in
not
applying
the
elementary
rules
of
federal
civil
procedure.
this
complaint
was
entitled
to
be
supported.
it
was
a
bonafide
complaint.
the
affidavits
disclos
that
it
was
bonafide.
they
showed
the
group
refusal
to
deal
prima
facie
wise.
instead,
i
think
the
one
raise
the
opinion,
one
fails
to
see
that
there
is
admitted
that
there
is
a
charge
here
of
conspiracy.
but
clearly,
when
the
pleader
says
that
each
