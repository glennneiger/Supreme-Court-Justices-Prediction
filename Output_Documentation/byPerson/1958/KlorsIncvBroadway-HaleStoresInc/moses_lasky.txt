mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
george
klor
or
klor's
incorporated
has
a
cause
of
action
for
some
kind
of
tort.
he
may
have.
he
may
and
he
may
not
under
california
law.
the
question
here
is
whether
he
has
a
cause
of
action
to
claim
for
relief
under
a
statute
which
was
enacted
for
some
very
important
purposes
of
the
sherman
antitrust
law.
now,
i'm
quite
gratified
with
mr.
elman's
argument
because
he's
going
to
permit
me
to
come
into
a
very
close
issue
with
him.
and
of
course,
i'm
disturbed
that
this
little
case
of
my
client
turns
out
to
be
one
in
which
it
is
contended
there
are
large
issues.
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
large
issues
and
i'm
convinced
that
the
case
was
decided
upon
what
has
been
elementary
law
for
many
years.
i
think
there
may
be
an
important
issue.
and
if
you'll
permit
me
to
state
it,
i'll
state
it
this
way.
it's
whether
the
sherman
act
is
down
to
be
reduced
to
a
sort
of
section,
a
self-evasion
of
a
federal
commercial
code
dealing
with
the
private
law
of
commercial
torts
because
for
a
suit,
there
may
be
interstate
commerce.
congress
could
have
enacted
that
kind
of
law
but
i
shall
submit
it
didn't
do
it.
now,
i'm
not
admitting
that
there's
interstate
commerce
involved
and
if
my
time
permits,
i'll
come
to
that
later.
i
want
to
get
me
down
to
the
main
--
main
question.
now
first,
let
me
say
it's
vital
to
consider
this
case,
not
some
other
case.
i
want
to
consider
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
because
it
hasn't
been
wholly
been
presented
upon
the
basis
of
how
it
was
presented
below.
now,
let
me
say
to
the
court
this
is
not
a
pleading
case.
it
was
not
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
outset
for
my
client,
broadway-hale,
and
then
withdrew
it
because
i
became
aware
of
this
court's
statement
in
the
employing
plasterer's
case
that
you
--
you
construe
with
the
pleadings
very
broadly
and
we
didn't
want
to
get
followed
up
and
all
that
procedural
imagination.
we
ask
the
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
don't
know
whether
i'd
be
prepared
to
--
to
say
that,
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
--
i
--
i
don't
care
to
argue
the
contrary.
we
have
assumed,
we
have
assumed
that
taking
the
compliant
by
itself,
it
would
do
so
because
it
had
some
allegations
in
there
about
monopoly
and
inferences
could
be
drawn
from
that.
now,
we
presented
this
case
upon
the
--
by
utilizing
some
of
the
advanced
tools
given
to
us
by
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
first,
we
had
a
pretrial
conference.
we
went
in
on
a
motion
and
it
was
converted
to
a
pretrial
hearing.
and
as
a
consequence
to
this
pretrial
hearing
in
the
motion,
the
issue
is
one
which
at
that
time,
all
the
parties
agreed
on.
of
course,
we
didn't
agree
when
they
answered
to
the
issue,
but
we
agreed
upon
the
issue.
what
we
did
with
our
affidavits
was
this.
we
assumed
that
there
was
sufficient
allegation
of
conspiracy.
we
assumed
it
because
you
cannot,
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
ever
litigate
that
issue.
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
may
be
proved
by
a
wide
latitude
of
evidence,
you
can't
dispose
of
it
in
a
summary
fashion.
so
we
assumed
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy,
but
we
struck
at
what
we
conceived
to
be
and
what
both
courts
below
have
agreed
with
us
was
the
jugular
vein
of
this
case.
we
filed
--
each
respondent
filed
an
affidavit.
they
weren't
denied.
not
only
weren't
they
denied,
they
were
admitted,
they
were
directly
admitted.
and
the
issue
as
it
finally
came
down
after
pruning
out
--
this
complaint
was
103
pages
long,
to
start
with,
40
counts.
i
just
followed
robinson-patman
allegations
and
it
was
finally
pruned
out
by
the
pretrial
order
into
this
kind
of
issue
as
stated
by
the
district
court.
just
the
case
of
a
retail
store
in
the
mission
district
of
san
francisco,
one
of
hundreds
in
the
city
engaged
in
selling
the
same
kind
of
merchandise.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
am
reading,
if
the
court
please,
from
page
134
of
the
record.
mr.
moses
lasky
which
has
complaint
that
certain
supplier,
defendants
won't
sell
it
some
merchandise
allegedly
at
the
behest
of
one
of
its
competitors.
and
judge
barnes
stated
it
this
way.
and
i'm
reading
first
from
154
of
the
record
and
then
from
161.
“by
a
pretrial
order,
one
count,
one
was
limited
to
a
single
conspiracy
charging
a
sherman
act
violation.
the
restraint
relied
on
was
in
preventing
plaintiff
from
obtaining
certain,”
the
emphasis
is
on
the
opinion,
“certain
electrical
appliances
for
resale
while
at
the
same
time
permitting
broadway-hale
to
purchase
those
certain
electrical
appliances.”
again,
the
emphasis
is
the
courts.
“this
is
a
simpler
refusal
to
sell,
allegedly,
by
joint
action.”
pardon
me.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
was
reading,
if
the
court
please,
from
161
of
the
record.
mr.
moses
lasky
now,
let
me
define
this
matter
even
more
specifically.
in
the
first
place,
this
case
does
not
involve
all
brands
of
these
products,
radios,
phonographs,
televisions,
refrigerators,
so
on.
only
a
small
fraction
are
involved.
our
affidavits
showed
that
there
were
over
20
major
brands
in
the
united
states
of
radios,
phonographs
and
televisions
being
sold
in
san
francisco
not
involved
in
this
case,
which
it
was
not
alleged
that
the
defendants
prevented
plaintiff
from
getting
any
of
them.
over
18
brands
of
refrigerators,
23
brands
of
stoves,
30
brands
of
washers
and
dryers,
all
on
the
average
something
like
six
to
seven
times
as
many
brands
of
these
various
appliances
not
involved
in
this
case
as
were.
and
as
was
said
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it's
159,
among
these
competing
brands
are
many
of
the
outstanding
and
most
widely
advertised
brands
in
the
country.
and
if
i
were
to
read
the
names
then
that
the
court
used,
it
would
look
like
the
blue
book
of
american
business,
capehart,
crosley,
du
mont,
hallicrafter,
magnavox,
motorola,
packard-bell,
westinghouse,
bendix,
i'm
just
skipping
over,
and
frigidaire,
international
harbor,
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
not
involved.
and
as
judge
barnes
went
on
to
say,
“the
appellant
does
not
charge
that
it
was
denied
the
right
to
handle
any
of
these
vast
number
of
brands
manufactured
and
sold
by
companies
not
parties
to
the
action.”
and
so,
i
say
in
the
first
place,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
a
certain
statement
that
sometimes
appears
in
the
briefs
of
my
adversaries,
about
the
elimination
of
a
competitor,
simply
should
be
swept
aside
as
an
improper
intruder
in
the
case.
there
was
no
conspiracy
alleged
about
eliminating
the
plaintiff
as
a
competitor
because
he
had
available
far
more
brands
than
the
few
involved
in
this
case.
now,
the
next
significant
fact
of
this
case
and
nobody
ever
disputed
this
when
we
were
arguing
at
the
district
court,
nor
was
it
ever
disputed
when
we
were
in
the
court
of
appeals.
these
cases
have
a
habit
of
producing
new
arguments
the
higher
you
get,
but
not
until
we
got
up
here
was
it
suggested
that
this
conspiracy
was
aimed
at
anybody
but
the
petitioner
alone?
and
again,
i
refer
to
what
judge
barnes
said,
that's
178
of
the
record.
he
says,
“the
conduct
here
was
conduct
directed
at
this
plaintiff
and
only
at
this
plaintiff.”
it
wasn't
aimed
at
anybody
else.
it
wasn't
aimed
at
the
market,
any
other
retailer,
any
other
wholesaler
or
the
public.
and
if
one
were
to
examine
the
complaint
which
appears
in
the
record
about
--
about
pages
9,
10
and
11,
you'll
find
that
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
was
that
my
client,
broadway-hale,
persuaded
the
other
defendants
to
deny
to
plaintiff
certain
articles.
it
didn't
persuade
them
to
deny
anybody
else
but
to
plaintiff.
now,
the
next
significant
fact
is
that
this
alleged
--
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon
me.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
doubt
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
doubt
it.
i'll
--
i'll
say
this.
if
it
had
alleged
that
klor's
was
a
price
cutter
and
they
agreed
not
to
sell
him
because
he
was
a
price
cutter,
this
would
be
a
different
kind
of
case.
this
motion
would
never
have
been
filed.
let
--
let
me
state
it
in
a
form
of
analogy,
if
i
may
do
so,
although,
all
analogies
are
a
little
lame.
it's
a
difference
between
a
rifle
shot
and
a
shotgun.
if
i
stand
up
here
and
aim
a
shotgun
at
the
public,
i
want
to
affect
price,
i
want
to
restrict
the
availability
of
commodities
to
it.
i
want
to
eliminate
a
better
type
of
goods
and
restrict
it
to
an
inferior
type.
and
if
one
of
the
pellets
strikes
the
plaintiff,
he
has
a
sherman
cause
of
action.
if
my
purpose
is
to
aim
a
rifle
at
him
and
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
because
he
stands
in
the
way
of
certain
purposes
of
the
defendant
group
on
fixing
prices,
he
has
a
sherman
act
cause
of
action.
or
if
i
use
a
shotgun
and
aim
only
at
him,
i
don't
intend
to
hit
the
public,
but
in
fact,
do
hit
the
public,
he
has
a
sherman
cause
of
action.
it's
a
question
then
of
purpose,
intent
or
consequence.
mr.
moses
lasky
that
is
the
suggestion
made
by
the
other
side.
that
i
think
is
the
issue
the
court
will
meet.
in
other
words,
take
my
facts,
what
i
say
the
facts
are,
that
here,
we
aimed
a
rifle
at
george
klor
--
this
is
the
allegation.
we
didn't
intend
to
shoot
the
public,
and
in
fact,
we
hit
nobody
but
george
klor.
he
remains
in
business,
he
has
all
of
his
range
of
goods
to
sell,
but
in
addition,
there
are
1113
other
dealers
in
san
francisco.
this
is
what
we
showed
selling
these
particular
products.
there
were
on
--
in
the
mission
district
some
50
odds
selling
this
particular
product.
and
as
judge
barnes
said,
“if
a
person
were
stroll
down
mission
street
for
a
period
of
11
blocks,
five
blocks
of
each
side
of
the
plaintiff,
he
would
have
come
to
43
shops
selling
the
particular
goods
here
involved?
mr.
moses
lasky
buy
--
mr.
moses
lasky
that's
--
that,
if
the
court
pleases,
is
the
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
you
will
then
have
a
different
kind
of
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
you'll
have
a
different
kind
of
case
because
then
you
would
have
to
consider
what
was
the
consequence
on
the
public
of
removing
one-half
the
shops.
a
very
clear
case
would
be
if
there
were
two
in
business
and
we
removed
just
one
other
in
business,
if
we
remove
him,
we
would
have
a
monopoly.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
you
might
--
this
is
why
i
--
i
insist,
if
i
may
say
so,
upon
the
facts
of
this
case.
you
might
have
a
case,
you
could,
in
which
you
have
to
weigh
a
lot
of
evidence
to
determine
it.
fortunately,
in
this
case
you
don't.
in
this
case,
there
is
the
effect
on
--
mr.
moses
lasky
the
effect
and
the
public
is
nailed.
unless
you
say,
unless
you
follow
the
suggestion
that
because
you
--
a
conspiracy,
an
alleged
conspiracy
to
refuse
to
deal
with
one
person
is
per
se
illegal.
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
if,
your
honor
please,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so
--
mr.
moses
lasky
it
is
--
it
has
not
been
so
held.
now,
there
isn't
any
question
at
all
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
the
lower
courts,
your
honors
decision
in
the
fashion
originators'
case
and
a
few
others
of
this
court
have
been
cited
to
the
proposition
that
a
group
boycott
is
per
se
illegal.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
recall
that
in
kiefer-stewart,
there
was
--
there
were
only
have
been
two
cases
in
this
court
where
a
group
boycott
was
involved.
kiefer-stewart
was
one
in
which
it
was
not
involved
and
there
was
language
on
it.
now,
my
opponents
have
suggested
that
you
treat
this
case
with
the
word
“group
boycott”.
in
the
first
place,
a
mere
joint
refusal
to
sale.
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
submit
it,
is
not
a
group
boycott.
in
--
in
all
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
where
they
were
talking
about
a
boycott,
they
were
treating
of
a
--
of
joint,
concerted
refusal
to
sell
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
boycotted
person
conform
to
their
wishes.
i'm
not
drawing
a
distinction
between
a
primary
boycott
and
a
secondary
boycott
because
both
of
those
--
that's
a
distinction
of
whether
you're
just
cutting
off
your
trade
with
one
person
or
cutting
it
off
from
him
to
make
him
cut
it
off
from
someone
else.
but
a
mere
joint
refusal
to
sell
as
distinguished
from
a
refusal
to
sell,
used
as
an
instrumentality
or
tool
to
compel
him
to
conform
your
--
to
your
wishes,
is
not
a
boycott.
and
this
is
the
distinction
that
goes
back
to
--
to
judge
taft
when
he
was
on
circuit.
but
let
me
pass
by
that
and
just
take
the
question
whether
a
joint
refusal
to
sell,
in
and
of
itself,
is
illegal
per
se.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
and
i
would
--
before
i
answer
that
question
and
come
to
the
court's
cases
because
i
--
i
can
discuss
them
all,
i
--
i
suggest
that
we
look
at
this
case
in
perspective.
here
is,
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
here
is
my
client's
shop,
next
door
to
it
or
two
doors
away
is
the
plaintiffs.
my
client
says
to
a
supplier,
“now,
look,
if
you
sell
to
him,
he's
going
to
handle
this
product,
i
don't
want
it.”
this
--
this
is
not
unusual.
this
is
the
commonest
thing
in
business.
this
is
brand
competition.one
shop
sells
interwoven
socks
and
the
other
sells
phoenix
socks.
one
sells
stetson
hats
and
the
other
sells
doves
hats.
and
the
one
fellow
says,
“now,
look,
if
--
if
you
want
to
sell
your
doves
hats
to
him
i'm
going
to
handle
some
other
brand.”
nothing
illegal
about
that,
so
we
say
it
to
another.
we
say
it
to
10,
10
different
suppliers,
still
leading,
plenty
of
brands
for
this
other
fellow
to
handle.
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
sort
of
thing
is
perfectly
legal,
(inaudible)
case,
the
bausch
&
lomb
case
upheld
it.
so
then
--
mr.
moses
lasky
for
the
moment.
i'm
taking
--
mr.
moses
lasky
there
--
we
have
here
of
what
you
might
call
a
series
of
six
or
eight
or
10
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
conspirators.
mr.
moses
lasky
up
to
this
moment,
in
my
--
in
my
case.
now,
there
were
four
other
shops
in
this
block
and
we
could
have
said
to
each
one
of
these
suppliers,
we,
broadway-hale,
wants
it
exclusive
on
that
brand
in
this
block
and
it
still
would
have
been
legal.
we
didn't
do
that.
there
were
still
four
others
in
this
block.
so
now,
let
us
add
to
it
the
additional
element
that
your
honor
here
refers
to.
and
this
is
the
element
which
according
to
my
adversaries
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
according
to
my
view,
makes
no
difference
at
all.
we
add
to
what
the
incredible
allegation
which
we
will
assume
to
be
true
that
each
of
these
suppliers
cross
agreed
so
that
you
had
one
conspiracy
with
my
client
and
10
suppliers
instead
of
10
vertical
conspiracy.
mr.
moses
lasky
we
have,
throughout
the
case
--
the
allegations
in
this
complaint
are
very
--
were
not
very
artistically
drawn
but
to
avoid
argument,
we
have
always
assumed
that
allegation.
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
not
going
to
dispute
it
and
judge
barnes
assumed
it
too.
now,
does
this
one
fact
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
make
the
conspiracy,
alleged
conspiracy,
illegal
per
se?
and
i
submit
to
the
court,
the
answer
is
no.
the
question
remains
whatever
all
--
has
always
been.
the
illegality
is
a
question
of
purpose
or
effect.
purpose
or
effect.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
sir.
mr.
moses
lasky
i'll
--
i'll
address
myself
to
that
right
now,
if
the
court
pleases.
your
honor
read
one
sentence.
there
was
a
sentence
that
preceded
it.
of
course,
here,
it
--
it
is
presumptions
perhaps
for
me
to
tell
your
honor
what
you
meant
by
an
opinion
you
wrote.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
that
--
that
is
precisely
so.
and
i
would
be
presumptuous
to
say
that
if
you
meant
something
more
than
what
i
get
out
of
it,
i
would
submit
your
honor
to
have.
this
was
preceded
by
the
words
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
the
kiefer-stewart
case
was
a
case
where
seagram
and
calvert
conspired
together
that
neither
would
sell
to
anybody
who
would
not
adhere
to
a
resale
price.
it
was
a
price-fixing
conspiracy.
and
the
sentence
was,
seagram
and
calvert
acting
individually
perhaps,
might
have
refused
to
deal
with
petitioner
or
with
any
or
all
of
the
indiana
wholesalers.
but
the
sherman
act
makes
it
an
offense
for
respondents
to
agree
among
themselves
to
stop
selling
to
particular
customers.
now,
the
court
was
not
stating
a
universal
rule,
it
was
speaking
here
of
seagram
and
calvert
in
the
facts
of
the
case
to
wit,
two
parties
conspiring
for
the
purposes
involved
in
that
case.
they
agreed
together
not
to
sell
for
what
purpose?
to
fix
prices.
and
i've
admitted
10-15
minutes
ago
that
this
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
you
can
take
every
case,
this
court
should
decide
it.
you
can
start
it
with
the
binder
of
case
which
is
the
first
one
back
in
263
u.s.
which
is
always
said
to
be
the
origin
of
the
rule
that
a
--
a
group
boycott
is
illegal
per
se.
there,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
distributors
controlled
all
films
in
the
united
states
which
could
not
be
procured
from
others
and
that
the
board
of
trade
was
organized
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
these
distributors
to
control
prices
and
dictate
terms
to
their
patrons
in
nebraska.
a
conspiracy
which
broke
out
of
a
particular
exhibitor
because
he
would
not
maintain
the
prices.
now,
judge
barnes
took
every
one
of
these
cases
and
analyzed
them
and
found
that
this
was
true.
that
in
every
one
of
them,
you
had
a
purpose
to
hit
the
public
or
you
had
an
effect
to
hit
the
public.
you
had
two
motion
pictures
theaters
in
a
town
and
one
was
knocked
out,
the
public
was
affected.
that's
why
i
say
we
could
have
--
i
can
imagine
cases
--
we
could
have
straight
--
take
these
problems.
but
in
a
case
like
this
where
you
have
1000
other
people
handling
it
in
the
city,
and
other
brands
available,
the
public
has
not
been
affected
at
all.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
it
comes
fairly
close
to
that
but
i
would
express
it
a
little
bit
differently.
and
--
and
you
know,
i
happen
to
agree
fairly
closely
with
mr.
elman,
although
other
counsel
for
other
defendants
haven't
agreed
with
me
on
this,
that
the
real
question
is
not
reasonableness,
the
rule
of
reason
here.
i
say
you
don't
reach
the
rule
of
reason
whether
a
restraint
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
until
you
first
decide
whether
it's
a
restraint.
i
say
the
key
question
in
the
case
is,
what
does
the
sherman
act
mean
by
the
word
term
“restraint
of
trade”.
now,
we
all
know
that
taken
literally,
it's
as
the
court
said
in
the
northern
pacific
case,
all
encompassing.
and
we
know
that
this
court
grappled
with
that
question
40
and
50
years
ago.
and
gradually,
it
began
spelling
out
what
it
meant.
the
terms
could
not
have
a
dryly
literal
meaning.
i
don't
even
think
the
court
ended
up
getting
at
the
common
law
meaning.
the
court
finally
spelled
out
the
meaning
of
restraint
from
three
sources,
the
common
law,
the
history
of
the
evil
that
the
act
was
designed
to
meet,
and
something
more
than
that.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
--
i
think
so.
i
think
the
apex
case
does,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
may
--
may
i
--
may
i
differ
with
your
honor
for
a
moment
on
that
and
express
my
reasons
why
did
we
--
mr.
moses
lasky
alfos
mason
in
his
biography
of
chief
justice
stone
has
quite
a
discussion
of
the
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
no,
but
i
say
let's
go
to
the
words
of
the
opinion
itself.
in
the
apex
case,
judge
stone,
after
reviewing
the
history
of
it,
have
this
to
say.he
said
not
all
restrictions
on
trade
or
commerce,
even
those
which
do
restrict
as
to
interstate
trade
and
commerce
and
i
intended
to
fall
under
the
sherman
act.
he
went
on
to
stay
beyond
that
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
that
the
end
sought
was
the
prevention
of
restraints
to
free
competition
in
business
and
commercial
transactions
which
tendered
to
restrict
production,
raise
prices
or
otherwise
control
the
market
to
the
detriment
of
purchasers
or
consumers
of
goods
and
services,
all
of
which
it
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
special
form
of
public
injury.
and
then
he
said
what
i
think
is
the
key
--
the
answer
perhaps
to
your
honor's
suggestion.
he
said
restraint,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
500
of
the
opinion
which
i
believe
was
in
310,
u.s.,
“restraint
on
competition
or
on
the
course
of
trade
in
the
merchandising
of
articles,
moving
in
interstate
commerce,
is
not
enough
unless
the
restraint
is
shown
to
have
or
has
intended
to
have
and
affect
upon
prices
in
the
market
or
otherwise
deprive
purchasers
or
consumers
of
the
advantages
which
they
derive
from
free
competition.”
now,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
--
mr.
moses
lasky
of
course.
the
characteristic
fact
of
the
case
was
that
there
was
a
sit
down
strike.
mr.
moses
lasky
but
enough
--
but
--
but
if
the
court
pleases,
another
outstanding
fact
about
the
case
was
that
while
--
if
i
recall,
the
court
was
asked
to
hold
the
trade
unions
that
labor
was
not
subject
to
the
sherman
act.
the
court
declined
to
place
it's
decision
on
that
ground,
and
chief
justice
stone
ended
up
with
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
law,
the
rule
he
was
laying
down
--
that
the
court
was
laying
down
there
was
the
same
in
labor
and
in
non-labor
cases.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
no.
mr.
moses
lasky
of
course,
you
cannot
detach
a
case
from
--
from
its
facts
and
that's
something
i've
--
myself
denied
not
over
five
minutes
ago.
mr.
moses
lasky
but
nevertheless,
chief
justice
stone
expressing
the
principles
was
trying
to
do
as
i
see
it
to
two
things.
he
was
trying
to
express
not
merely
a
narrow
--
narrowest
possible
rule
that
would
dispose
of
the
case
before
and
he
was
dealing
with
a
--
with
a
rather
--
rather
vexing
problem
on
the
construction
of
the
sherman
act
and
as
meaning
of
the
term
restraint.
he
was
trying
to
lay
down
some
universal
principles.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
he
was
being
careful
to
say
that
they
were
principles
that
were
not
confined
to
labor.
number
three,
he
was
very
--
he
--
he
use
language
which
as
i
have
just
read
it,
fully
applies
to
the
commercial
situation.
in
other
words,
i
say
the
distinction
isn't
between
a
commercial
case
and
a
non-commercial
because
he
said
restraint
on
competition
or
on
the
course
of
trade
in
the
merchandising
of
articles.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
if
the
court
pleases
--
mr.
moses
lasky
this
is
the
same
--
mr.
moses
lasky
of
course,
they're
two
different
acts
because
the
--
because
the
federal
trade
commission
act
has
something
explicitly
read
in
there
about
public
interest.
this
we
know.
but
on
the
other
hand
from
the
earliest
time
this
same
thing
has
been
read
into
the
sherman
act.
now,
the
conclusions
we've
arrived
at
,
after
a
little
brief
submitted,
we've
arrived
at
to
apex
which
i've
always
considered
as
a
rather
more
refined
expression
of
the
rule
that
this
court
had
been
coming
to
for
a
long
period
of
years.
for
example,
back
in
the
corn
products
case
which
was
decided
in
1914
many
years
before
--
before
apex,
the
court
had
expressed
it
somewhat
differently
having
reached
it
from
standard
oil
through
justice
holmes'
opinion
in
the
nash
case
and
so
on
where
he
said,
where
the
court
said
that
the
prohibitions
of
the
statue
were
enacted
to
prevent
not
the
mere
injury
to
an
individual
but
the
arm
to
the
general
public
which
would
be
occasioned
by
the
evils
which
it
was
contemplated,
would
be
prevented.
and
hence,
the
prohibitions
of
the
statue
were
coextensive
with
such
conceptions.
and
then
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
mandeville
case
in
1948,
we
expressed
the
same
when
he
said
that
the
test
of
the
private
parties'
right
to
recovery
under
the
react
is
whether
the
statute's
policy
has
been
violated
in
the
manner
to
produce
the
general
consequence
it
forbids
for
the
public
and
a
special
consequence
for
the
particular
individual.
now,
it
is
true
i
have
not
found,
i
don't
believe
i
have
found
any
case
in
this
court
but
there
are
a
multitude,
there
is
a
multitude
of
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
dealt
with
precisely
this
problem
--
i'll
go
further.
there
are
cases,
everyone
of
them,
where
the
plaintiffs'
rights
were
much
stouter
than
they
were
here,
stronger
cases
and
yet
without
a
single
exception,
the
lower
courts
starting
as
far
back
as
in
the
30s
have
held
that
in
this
particular
kind
of
case,
the
plaintiff
had
no
rights.
and
when
i
say
this
particular
kind
of
case,
i
mean
a
case
where
a
particular
dealer,
sales
agent,
consignee,
distributor
of
some
kind
handling
the
product
is
driven
out
by
virtual
conspiracy.
and
yet
the
court
say,
“well,
there
are
many
other
brands
available?
the
public
hasn't
been
hurt,
you
can't
say
any
competition
has
been
affected.
i
think
it
was
the
third
circuit
(inaudible)
where
the
courts
made
in
the
seventh
--
where
the
courts
--
it
would
be
effect
on
competition
is
like
the
effect
on
the
temperature
of
a
light
of
match
in
all
outdoors.”
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
sir.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
don't
think
so
and
for
this
reason.
if
we
haven't
had
the
pretrial
hearing,
and
i
--
i
don't
know
what
i
might
say
about
it,
but
we
brought
up
our
motion
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
moses
lasky
you
--
you
state
a
case
where
there
was
a
conspiracy
not
to
sell
to
him
--
to
sell
--
mr.
moses
lasky
if
the
court
pleases,
i
have
no
qualms
in
saying
that
if
we
had
a
complaint
that
charge
us
with
conspiring
not
to
sell
to
him
because
he
was
a
price
cutter,
it
would
state
a
case
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
moses
lasky
because
from
the
moment
we
walked
into
court,
we
raised
this
question
and
he
never
contented
that
this
was
a
price
case,
neither
was
our
motion
for
judgment
came
on,
several
months
after
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
first
filed
that
we
called
attention
to
this
point.
and
in
arguing
the
case
from
the
district
court
and
throughout
arguing
the
case
from
the
court
of
appeals,
it
always
said,
“price
fixing
is
not
the
only
kind
of
case
where
you
--
there's
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
or
injury
to
the
public.”
in
other
words
i
--
i
assume
that
when
this
court
granted
to
sue
the
writ,
it
did
so
to
decide
a
certain
--
what
was
conceived
to
be
important
issues
of
law
and
not
to
reappraise
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
court
about
this
particular
complaint.
i
say
that
because
it
was
never
argued
by
my
opponent
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
any
price
fixing
element
involved
here.
they
never
suggested
it.
have
they
suggested
it
in
the
district
court,
we
might
have
taken
a
different
course.
i
think
i
could
lay
my
hand
upon
--
unfortunately,
we
didn't
bring
up
the
oral
arguments.
but
i
did
fortunately
bring
in
to
the
record
what
counsel
had
put
in
his
brief
in
the
district
court
on
this
point
and
i
refer
to
page
129
of
the
record.
defendant
--
this
is
quoting
from
the
plaintiff.
of
course,
it
was
not
mr.
keith,
mr.
keith
is
not
in
the
case
at
the
time.
mr.
keith
came
to
it
on
appeal.
“defendants
in
effect
argued
that
the
conspiracy
cannot
be
within
the
prohibitions
of
the
sherman
act
since
the
conspirators
did
not
fix
or
regulate
prices,
limit
production
or
distribution
or
bring
about
a
deterioration
in
quality
that
these
actions
are
not
along
the
types
of
conduct
prohibited
by
the
sherman
act.”
there
was
no
suggestion
or
indication
that
the
plaintiff
desired
under
this
complaint
to
contend
that
anyone
of
these
things,
prices,
production,
and
so
forth,
were
involved.
and
he
so
suggested,
the
case
might
have
taken
a
different
course.
and
i
say
when
we
get
up
to
this
court,
the
case
should
be
determined
upon
the
basis
upon
which
it
was
universally
treated
in
the
courts
below.
now,
i
have
said
that
there
are
a
veritable
hosted
cases
in
the
lower
courts
of
this
very
character.
as
far
back
as
the
--
the
abeloff
case
in
--
which
came
up
in
san
francisco
in
1939.
precisely
this
case,
a
group
of
defendants
were
charged
of
having
conspired
not
to
sell
to
the
plaintiff
dealer.
and
it
was,
held
no
public
injury.
then
there's
the
famous
shotkin
case
from
the
tenth
circuit.
any
defendants,
general
electric,
westinghouse
and
their
distributors,
as
the
counterpart
of
this
case
which
is
the
counterpart
of
that,
were
accused
of
having
conspired
not
to
sell
to
the
plaintiff.
that
case
was
decided
on
the
pleadings
and
it
was
held
so
what,
he
could
get
other
products
and
there
were
numerous
other
dealers
involved.
this
concept
of
the
public
injury
has
been
criticized
as
having
been
upset
by
the
radovich
case
which
of
course
is
justice
clark's
opinion.
now,
before
taking
up
the
opinion
itself,
may
i
suggest
that
no
lower
court,
no
lower
court
at
all
has
considered
that
the
radovich
case
outlawed
or
swept
away
the
public
injury
concept.
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
regal
case,
and
curiously
enough,
the
--
the
--
i
think
it's
the
third,
miller
motors
case
in
252
f
2d,
which
i
think
is
interesting
to
note
because
the
solicitor
general
appears
against
me
and
that
opinion
was
by
judge
sobeloff
who
was
the
predecessor
solicitor
general
and
he
states
the
public
injury
point
as
if
it
still
--
still
the
law.
that
--
this
was
just
the
other
day,
252,
f.2d.
therefore,
there
will
be
no
showing
of
any
public
injury
resulting
from
a
restraint
of
commerce
and
automobiles
or
advertising.
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
sherman
act
has
been
violated.
the
hybrid
nature
of
a
private
antitrust
suit
dictates
that
to
succeed.
the
plaintiff
must
prove
not
only
that
the
defendant
has
infringed
one
or
more
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
public
injury
but
also
that
the
infringement
has
resulted
in
private
injury.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
turn
to
the
radovich
case.
the
respondents
in
the
radovich
case
presented
a
very
curious
argument.
they
said
in
effect
that
the
plaintiff
in
a
private
suit
must
allege
and
prove
more
than
the
government
must
prove
in
a
government
suit.
they
said
in
addition
to
showing
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
they
must
prove
a
public
injury.
and
the
court's
answer
to
that
is
as
it
should
have
been.
if
you
have
a
proof
of
violation,
you
prove
the
violation.
but
the
question
is
what
constitutes
a
violation?
and
this
is
--
reference
has
been
made
to
--
to
milton
handler
--
milton
handler
article
discusses
the
klor's
case.
and
he
says
that
what
judge
barnes
did
and
seemed
to
him
to
be
correct.
you
cannot
divorce
that
question
of
the
effect
upon
the
public
from
the
concept
of
what
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
you
don't
have
to
prove
something
in
addition
to
violation.
you
don't
have
to
come
into
court
with
any
formulistic
set
of
words
in
the
complaint
that
there
has
been
a
public
injury.
if
you
allege
the
kind
of
action
which
from
its
nature
is
deleterious
to
the
public
like
price
fixing,
reducing
quantity
available,
you
have
automatically
alleged
the
kind
of
restraint
which
is
--
has
a
public
injury.
if
having
alleged
it,
you
prove
your
allegations,
you
proved
your
case.
but
if
your
allegation
in
your
case
is
one
which
is
not
in
and
of
its
essential
nature
deleterious
to
the
public,
then
you've
got
to
go
further
and
show
what's
involved.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
--
mr.
moses
lasky
this
is
what
i
would
do
with
it.
i
would
say
and
this
is
what
the
case
started
--
there
are
certain
elements.
or
this
--
this
would
the
robinson-patman
case.
now,
there
were
40
robinson-patman
counts
here
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have
a
sherman
act
conspiracy
to
violate
the
robinson-patman
act.
now,
i'll
tell
you
why
i
say
so.
the
seller
who
grants
a
discriminatory
price
less
to
my
client
and
to
mr.
klor's
is
guilty
of
violating
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
buyer
is
not
guilty
and
cannot
be
held
liable
for
damages
unless
he
knowingly
received.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
sell
to
the
plaintiff
10%
higher?
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
it
certainly
would
be
within
the
sherman
act.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
it's
--
it's
--
you're
dealing
with
it
because
you
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
you
--
you
stated
a
different
case.
you
stated
the
steel
company
selling
steel
to
the
united
states
which
is
a
buyer,
a
consumer
and
how
--
how
can
i
say
the
public
has
not
been
injured
when
i
got
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
it
isn't
a
statute
--
mr.
moses
lasky
because
klor's
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
think
if
there
was
an
agreement
among
--
among
all
these
people
to
sell
to
klor's
10%
higher
than
they
sold
to
our
people,
it
might
very
well
have
a
sherman
act
case.
but
there's
any
such
allegation
in
this
case
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
but
what
i
was
--
my
mind
went
off
to
--
to
all
these
allegations
in
103
pages
about
discrimination
if
we're
moved
out
into
the
other
39
counts.
mr.
moses
lasky
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
which
the
courts
have
--
almost
from
the
beginning
said,
is
essentially
deleterious
to
the
public
when
you
start
tampering
with
something
so
sensitive
as
prices.
mr.
moses
lasky
you
know,
if
--
if
i
did
happen
to
have
a
case
involving
a
--
of
a
particular
problem
of
two
tiny
little
merchants
on
mission
street
who
--
which
of
whom
had
a
$500
volume
a
year
and
they
agreed
with
each
other
to
run
up
their
price
one
cent,
i
would
say
the
sherman
act
--
well,
wouldn't
be
trivialized
and
wasn't
violated.
this
is
like
--
tell
me
what
is
the
--
the
10
tailors
of
tully
street
petitioning
parliament
to
the
name
of
the
people
of
england.
we've
got
to
stop
somewhere.
the
sherman
act
was
enacted
for
some
very
important
purposes.
and
it
cannot
be
--
i
suggest
it
cannot
be
trivialized
in
this
way.
not
--
everybody
knows,
if
the
court
pleases,
those
of
us
in
the
firing
line
know
at
least
that
up
to
10
years
ago,
every
squabble
controversy
or
to
use
the
jargon
of
the
street,
every
beat
was
cast
in
the
terms
of
negligence
or
fraud.
and
those
of
us
down
on
the
firing
line
now
know
that
every
controversy
now
gets
cast
in
terms
of
an
antitrust
violation.
and
all,
by
the
little
rubric
conspiracy.
and
so,
they
tempt
us
to
look
everything
into
the
federal
courts.
just
the
other
day,
congress
passed
an
act
to
protect
the
federal
courts
from
being
deluged
of
what
ought
to
be
state
court
litigation
by
limiting
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
i
submit
without
any
hesitation
at
all
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
didn't
know
that
but
i
move
freely
to
what
i
thought
isn't
sound
--
your
policy
judgments,
the
rubric
diversity
is
going
to
be
eliminated
and
everybody
is
going
to
come
in
under
the
rubric
conspiracy.
and
you
--
you
can't
answer
the
conspiracy
except
to
deny
it
and
then
you
have
to
go
to
trial,
and
the
federal
courts,
you're
just
going
to
be
deluged
in
the
same
old
way
--
mr.
moses
lasky
it's
increasing
with
geometric
progression
in
the
last
few
years,
and
this
--
this
case
here,
i
don't
know
whether
to
call
it
the
apogee
or
the
native
of
that
development.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
--
well,
at
time
we
filed
the
motion,
we
didn't
think
of
it
that
in
those
terms.
we
thought
we
were
proceeding
on
some
elementary
law
and
--
and
the
courts
below
did
too.
well
now,
let
me
touch
on
--
on
one
other
matter
and
as
i
won't
have
to
touch
on
it
tomorrow.
i
may
not
even
have
to
speak
tomorrow.
something
has
been
said
about
interstate
commerce.
interstate
commerce
is
involved
here
in
the
sense
that
these
products
come
from
outside
of
the
state,
although
if
we
ever
tried
it,
we'd
find
it
wasn't
quite
that
way.
but
while
the
amount
of
interstate
commerce
involved
in
any
industry
or
section
that's
involved
in
the
cases
of
no
consequence
at
all,
what
is
important
is
that
what
is
involved
must
be
appreciably
or
substantially
effective
with
industry
