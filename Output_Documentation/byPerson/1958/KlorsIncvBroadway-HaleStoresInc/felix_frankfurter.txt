mr.

--
justice

frankfurter
--
will
this
complaint
sustain
a
proceeding
by
the
federal
trade
commission?
is
this
a
violation
of
the
clayton
act
or
the
federal
trade
commission
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
is,
then
--
because
the
federal
trade
commission
proceeds
in
such
a
proceeding,
the
question
of
whether
the
public
interest
is
involved
would
be
relevant
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
it
might
well
be
found
that
it
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
violation
is,
but
that
the
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
drown
in
the
drum,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
it
make
any
difference
or
would
your
argument
be
different
if
your
client
have
persuaded
all
the
others
not
to
sell
because
the
commodity
as
to
which
they
made
an
arrangement,
except
at
a
10%
higher
price
maybe
anybody
else
is
getting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
him,
nobody
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suggestion
is
--
the
suggestion
is
that
a
combination
of
suppliers
not
to
sell
to
a
single
individual
or
to
sell
this
advantageously
as
against
other
people,
it's
in
and
of
itself
affecting
the
public
because,
(a)
he's
one
of
the
public,
and
(b)
the
public
is
entitled
to
make
its
choice
from
people
to
have
equal
access
to
the
supplies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
buyer
is
very
capricious
then
the
buyer
might
have
wanted
to
go
to
the
44th
shop,
and
access
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
him
was
cut
off.
is
that
right?
that's
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
concept
--
no
concept
--.
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
your
time,
no
concept
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
concept
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
between
the
suppliers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
to
get
the
meaning
out
of
the
word
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lasky,
doesn't
your
argument
or
your
contention
really
get
down
or
isn't
it
not
a
fair
statement
that
what
you're
doing,
what
you're
arguing
comes
down
to
is
to
read
into
the
sherman
law
and
make
sure
the
public
interest
in
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
in
effect,
that's
what
it
gets
down
to,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
any
case
in
this
court,
we've
gone
to
them
recently
but
i
have
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
case
which
makes
a
distinction
between
the
same
--
the
same
--
what
shall
i
say,
combination
among
suppliers
or
manufacturers
directed
against
--
directed
for
having
small
consequences
and
having
larger
consequences?
is
there
any
--
any
case
in
our
--
in
this
--
in
our
report
that
makes
the
kind
of
a
distinction
that
is
the
basis
of
the
present
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no.
i
think
really
not,
mr
lasky.
i
think
that
went
on
the
special
consideration
of
--
of
whether
a
conduct
by
state
unions
tell
their
minds
whether
one
agrees
or
not,
hasn't
--
to
be
treated
differently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
forgive
me.
this
is
what
i'm
trying
to
bring
you
back
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
must
i
go
to
mason
to
find
out
what
that
brings
you
in
apex?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
what
he
says.
that
was
attachments
to
clearly
fuse
the
opinion
if
i
may
say
so,
but
can
you
say
--
can
you
deny
that
the
decisive
thing
in
that
case
was
that
special
consequences,
the
--
like
the
coronado
coal
case,
the
particular
relation
of
conduct
by
trade
union
and
the
derivatives,
not
in
the
(inaudible)
of
question
of
trade
union
activities
upon
(inaudible)
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
only
says
the
reasons
the
court
declined.
i
--
i
was
down
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
apex
was
decided.
the
reason
it
declined
to
do
that
is
also
clear
because
the
court
has
already
held
in
the
second
coronado
case,
that
a
trade
union,
unlike
the
trade
disputes
act
of
england
which
immunize
labor
unions
from
the
restraint
of
trade,
unlike
the
english
law
following
(inaudible)
decision.
in
the
second
coronado
case,
it
was
held
that
if
trade
unions
bring
action
against
an
employer
to
mind
in
the
case,
in
order
to
put
it
out
of
business
and
not
to
promote
legitimate
interest
of
trade
union,
they
were
within
the
sherman
laws.
or
if
trade
unions
combined
with
manufacturers
and
employers,
they
are
within
the
sherman
law.
so
that,
what
was
said
by
justice
stone
in
apex
was
nothing
new
and
he
would
have
had
to
do
that
to
reach
a
result
and
they
couldn't
have
reached.
the
courts
couldn't
have
a
court
to
say,
that
trade
unions
as
such
are
outside
the
sherman
law
the
way
agriculture
cooperated,
they're
outside
of
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
can't
--
i
don't
have
to
tell
you,
mr.
lasky.
you
can't
take
the
words
with
such
a
long
opinion
as
that
was,
and
detached
from
the
essential
fact
of
that
case,
namely,
as
you
say,
this
was
a
sit-down
strike
in
order
to
promote
conventional
legitimate
and
personal
trade
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
trying
to
win
this
case,
you
had
any
light
on
the
problem
that
worries
me,
namely,
by
the
--
the
sherman
law
doesn't
apply
to
minimal
situation,
if
you
please,
but
if
you
--
if
you
multiply
it,
take
some
of
the
hypothetic
cases
put
to
it,
justice
--
by
justice
black.
this
is
one
dealer.
how
about
three
dealers?
how
about
five
dealers?
i
can
assure
you
the
sherman
law
gives
one
enough
trouble,
this
gives
me
enough
trouble
without
having
to
decide
when
is
--
when
is
something
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
i
press
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
even
english
sherman
law
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
say
to
my
question
a
while
ago
that
if
they
agreed
to
sell
them
all
the
commodities
as
to
which
they
made
an
arrangement,
whether
10%
higher
price
than
anybody
else
would
charge
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
would
you
do
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
if
--
if
all
the
steel
corporations
agree
to
--
to
sell
to
the
united
states
the
needed
steel,
that's
10%
higher
than
any
one
of
them
had
identical
prices,
that
would
have
been
within
the
sherman
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
no.
all
the
steel
manufacturers.
the
nearest
view
in
(inaudible)
to
say,
we'll
--
let's
agree
to
jack
up
the
price
10%
of
the
offers
were
heretofore
made,
wouldn't
that
be
within
the
sherman
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
difference
is
it
between
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i've
asked
--
the
reason
i
put
that
is
--
is,
just
that
my
case
would
be
patman
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
injury
but
i'm
--
that
isn't
a
question
of
injury.
but
the
question
of
whether
that
--
you
put
my
case
as
to
klor's,
say
that
would
be
the
patman
act?
i
didn't
quite
appreciate
that.
why
would
that
be
a
patman
act?
it
might
be
a
patman
act
also.
that's
not
on
the
clearer
statutes
on
the
the
statutes
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
about
the
sherman
law
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
(voice
overlap)
of
sellers
who
sell
by
agreement
at
a
higher
level
than
anyone
of
them
individually
would
sell
to
the
supplier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no,
no,
i
didn't
mean
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
would
be
--
likely
would
be
within
the
sherman
law
because
that's
per
se
price
fixing,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
it'd
only
be
one
seller
out
of
10,000
whatever
it
is
--
20,000
of
these
little
sellers
sell
you
all
these
commodities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i've
got
a
feelings
of
my
prejudice,
mr.
lasky.
