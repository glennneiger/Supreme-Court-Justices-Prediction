mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
is
appearing
in
this
case
as
amicus
curiae
because
the
decision
below
seems
to
raise
questions
of
large
importance
in
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
where
it
not
for
the
broad
sweep
of
the
decision
below
upholding
the
award
of
summary
judgment
for
the
defendants,
this
would
seem
to
be
a
rather
simple
routine
antitrust
case.
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
to
the
basis
of
the
judgment
--
judgment
below,
the
district
court
as
appears
from
its
order
on
page
134
of
the
record,
stated
that
count
one
of
the
complaint
is
not
a
cause
of
action
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming,
as
appears
from
the
opinion,
page
176,
bottom
of
the
--
178
rather,
bottom
of
the
page.
the
complaint
did
not
allege
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
it
did
not
state
facts
from
which
injury
to
the
public
can
be
perceived.
so
that
the
crucial
document
in
the
case
is
the
complaint.
and
as
mr.
keith
has
pointed
out,
the
complaint
here
contains
the
standard
general
allegations
of
the
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
with
resulted
damage
to
the
plaintiff.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
particularize
the
allegations
of
the
specific
restraints
that
we
used.
and
it
alleges
that
at
the
instigation
of
the
plaintiff's
next
door
competitor,
broadway-hale,
a
branch
of
a
chain
store
operation
in
the
--
in
the
far
west.
a
group
of
suppliers
of
household
appliances
including
the
more
--
the
most
important
manufacturers
and
distributors,
entered
into
an
agreement
each
with
the
other,
had
specifically
alleged
in
the
complaint,
page
11
of
the
record.
that
each
of
these
suppliers
of
appliances
in
competition
with
each
other,
each
agreed
that
none
of
them
would
do
business
--
that
none
of
them
would
sell
their
products
to
the
plaintiff.
now,
that
allegation
is
--
is
of
course
what
is
known
in
the
jargon
of
the
antitrust
practitioners
as
a
suppliers
group
boycott,
which
in
it's
very
nature
restrains,
eliminates
competition
in
two
respects.
first,
it
restrains
competition
among
the
parties
to
the
agrrement.
they
are
--
they're
no
longer
competing
with
one
another
for
the
costume
--
customers
of
klor's
and
with
respect
to
their
products.
that
competition
is
inherently
necessarily
eliminated
by
the
combination.
the
other
respect
in
which
competition
is
inherently
necessarily
restrained
is
with
--
is
a
relation
to
klor's.
klor's
can
no
longer
compete
with
his
competitors,
the
retailers
in
his
marketing
area
with
--
as
to
the
product
sold
by
these
defendants
to
them
but
not
to
him.
while
klor's
can't
buy,
he
can't
offer
for
resale.
and
so
he
is
necessarily
eliminated
as
a
competitor
to
those
products.
now,
the
illegality
of
that
kind
of
restraint
is
not
a
novel
or
doubtful
one,
it
goes
back
to
the
ancient
common
law
precedents.
some
of
them
dealing
with
physical
fencing
in
of
a
competitor.
here,
you
have
economic
fencing
here
but
it's
the
very
type
of
thing
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
the
sherman
act
condemns.
when
the
matter
first
came
up
in
montague
against
lowry
in
193
u.s.
in
1904,
mr.
justice
peckham's
opinion
for
the
court
didn't
discuss
the
matter
at
any
great
length
because
he
said
the
matter
is
--
is
plain,
it
requires
no
elaboration.
and
there
--
the
--
the
opinions
of
this
court
which
repeat
that
group
boycotts,
concerted
refusals
to
deal
agreements
to
refuse
to
supply
are
illegal
per
se.
those
opinions
--
those
cases
are
the
landmarks
to
the
antitrust
law.
the
most
recent
statement
to
that
effect
appears
in
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
last
term
in
northern
pacific
railway
company
which
is
stated
categorically
without
any
qualification.
now,
maybe
laboring
the
obvious
to
say
that
this
case
is
a
simple
routine
per
se
restraint
case.
but
somehow
that
fact,
that
starting
point
of
the
--
of
the
case
seems
to
have
been
perhaps
overlooked
in
--
in
the
courts
below.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
--
if
one
accepts
the
proposition
at
the
opinions
of
this
court
compel
that
a
restraint
of
this
kind
is
inherently
anti-competitive,
inherently
suppresses
competition.
it
solves
the
inquiry,
it
solves
the
question
that
was
--
that
is
much
--
much
discussed
in
the
opinion
below
as
to
the
nature
of
the
injury
to
the
public.
the
public
is
necessarily
injured
as
congress
itself
has
determined
by
making
this
kind
of
restraint
illegal.
congress
has
determined
that
this
is
an
injury
to
the
public.
and
that's
exact
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
that
judge
lawrence's
opinion
represents
an
attempt
to
blend
two
concepts
in
the
antitrust
law.
the
public
injury
concept,
the
rule
of
reason
concept.
we
believe
that
neither
one
of
those
is
properly
applicable
to
this
kind
of
situation.
as
to
the
first
public
injury.
i
think
it
might
be
--
it
might
suffice
to
rely
on
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
condsidered
this
question,
we
believe,
two
terms
ago
in
radovich.
now,
the
public
injury
doctrine
rests
on
some
general
language
appearing
in
three
opinions
of
this
court.
those
opinions
are
cited
and
quoted
on
page
29
of
the
respondent's
brief,
the
white
brief.
one
is
the
opinion
of
chief
justice
white
in
the
wilder
manufacturing
case
in
1915.
that
was
case
that
very
much
involved
in
the
problem
that
was
before
your
honors
in
and
kelly
against
kosuga,
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
well,
sherman
act
doesn't
--
defends
to
a
suit
for
a
breach
of
contract
case.
the
other,
the
second
one
is
mr.
justice
rutledge's
opinion
in
1948
in
the
mandeville
farms
case
which
involved
the
question
of
whether
a
conspiracy
to
fix
prices
among
a
group
of
sugar
refineries
violated
the
antitrust
laws
where
its
impact
was
on
the
growers
of
sugar
beets
in
northern
california.
whether
the
sellers
of
product
is
as
to
which
it
was
a
price
fixing
combination
had
cause
of
action.
and
the
third,
what
the
respondents
called
the
key
case
is
apex
hosiery
against
leader.
mr.
justice
as
he
was
then,
mr.
justice
stone's
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case
involving
a
sitdown
strike
of
workers
which
undoubtedly
interrupted
the
interstate
business,
the
interstate
transportation
of
the
plaintiff.
the
question
was,
“was
that
the
kind
of
restraint
of
trade
that
the
sherman
act
dealt
with?”
the
answer
the
court
gave
was
no.
now,
in
the
course
of
these
three
opinions,
there
is
general
language
as
to
the
scope
of
the
sherman
act.
and
--
and
the
court
says
that
the
sherman
act
doesn't
deal
merely
with
private
injuries,
it
deals
with
public
wrongs.
that
congress
has
taken
over
the
common
law
concept
of
--
of
contracts
and
restraint
of
trade
which
were
unenforceable
and
took
that
doctrine
from
the
law
of
contracts
and
created
a
statutory
wrong,
a
statutory
tort,
a
statutory
crime.
these
were
--
these
were
wrongs
not
merely
against
those
hurt
by
the
conduct,
but
they
were
wrongs
against
the
public.
now,
that
concept
is
of
course
unexceptionable.
no
one
quarrels
with
that
description
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
nature
of
the
sherman
act
but
it's
taking
a
long
step
to
say
public
injure
--
public
wrong
is
to
be
equated
with
public
injury,
and
public
injury
is
to
be
equated
with
injury
to
the
public.
an
injury
to
the
public
is
not
something
that
a
court
considers
in
construing
the
statute,
but
public
injury
is
something
that's
to
be
demonstrated
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
the
plaintiff
as
part
of
his
cause
of
action.
it
has
to
be
alleged.
it
has
to
be
proved.
now,
in
the
radovich
case,
which
came
before
the
court
two
terms
ago,
the
same
cases
had
been
used
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
circuit
in
cases
that
it
were
--
are
--
were
referred
to
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
radovich
case.
those
--
those
lower
court
cases
had
developed
this
doctrine,
particularly
applicable
to
private
treble
damage
actions
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
proof
injury
to
the
public
as
well
as
injury
to
them
--
to
himself.
and
judge
chambers
and
his
opinion
on
the
radovich
case
said
that
--
perhaps,
radovich
was
hurt
but
the
public
wasn't
hurt.
the
all
american
league
for
which
he
played
and
as
to
which
he
alleged
the
conspiracy,
they
were
--
they
were
still
in
business,
they
weren't
damaged.
so,
said
judge
chambers,
“there's
no
injury
to
the
public.”
now,
of
course,
the
major
question
in
the
case
when
it
came
here
was
whether
football
is
a
business
protected
by
the
antitrust
law.
but
there
was
a
second
basis
of
decision
of
--
of
the
ninth
circuit
to
which
the
--
this
court
in
its
opinion
addressed
itself.
and
that
was
this
contention
that
the
plaintiff
in
a
private
damage
action
can't
succeed
merely
by
showing
that
he
has
been
hurt.
he
has
to
show
that
the
public
has
been
hurt.
and
the
answer
given
by
the
court
was
simple,
direct,
clear.
the
answer
was
that
congress
has,
by
legislative
fiat,
determined
that
in
--
that
activities
prohibited
by
the
act
are
injurious
to
the
public.
now,
i
should
like
if
i
may,
to
consider
the
practical
implications
of
this
--
of
this
argument.
the
--
as
--
as
mr.
keith
pointed
out,
here
was
a
complaint
not
demurrable.
no
answer
denying
the
allegations,
having
such
an
answer
denied,
the
case
have
gone
to
trial.
no
answer
giving
an
affirmative
defense
by
way
of
business
excuse
or
justification
for
it
saying
this
was
perfectly
reasonable,
it's
a
matter
of
business
necessity,
no
defense
of
that
sort.
instead,
what
the
defendants
did
was
move
for
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
which
they
submitted
to
the
district
court.
now,
those
affidavits
are
--
the
substance
of
them
is
very
graphically
depicted
in
a
chart
which
the
--
the
defendants
have
submitted
to
this
court
which
appears
in
their
brief
opposite
page
10.
it's
a
map
of
the
business
district
in
which
the
plaintiffs
--
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendants
do
business.
and
it
shows
mission
street,
number
2500
block
of
mission
street,
you'll
--
there
--
there,
you'll
find
an
arrow
pointing
towards
klor's,
the
plaintiff
here.
he's
--
he
was
at
20
--
he
was
at
2581
and
right
next
to
him,
not
identified,
is
the
defendant
hale,
2565.
and
the
basis
of
the
--
the
entire
case
here
is
--
is
shown
by
this
--
this
chart
that
because
there
were
these
other
retailers
all
selling
the
appliances
which
were
denied
by
the
defendants
to
the
plaintiff
because
every
--
these
other
retailers
were
still
in
business,
still
able
to
sell
them
to
the
public
because
there
was
no
showing
that
the
price
to
the
consumers
had
been
raised
or
that
there
had
been
any
effect
as
to
quantity
or
quality
of
the
goods
available.
because
of
that,
courts
below
held
that
it
was
not
conceivable,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
there
was
any
injury
to
the
plain
--
to
the
public
upon
the
--
upon
the
basis
of
which
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
could
be
made
out.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
your
honor.--
mr.
philip
elman
not
--
not
so
far
as
i
understand
the
rule
of
reason.
now,
the
rule
of
--
the
rule
of
reason
which
--
i'm
not
going
to
take
your
honors
time
to
hold
forth
on,
certainly
does
not
permit
a
court
to
inquire
as
--
not
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
restraint
but
as
to
who
is
hurt
by
the
restraint.
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
classic
formulation
of
the
rule
of
reason
in
the
chicago
board
of
trade
case
in
264
u.s.,
i
believe
it
is,
says
that
the
--
that
every
business
agreement
tends
to
restrain.
it
binds
the
--
the
parties
to
the
agreement.
they
agreed
not
to
do
something
that
they
would
otherwise
be
freed
to
do.
therefore,
the
true
test
of
--
of
legality
is
not
whether
an
agreement
restrains
but
whether
the
agreement
is
one
that
promotes
competition,
that
regulates
and
fosters
competition
or
whether
it
is
one
that
suppresses
or
destroys
it.
now,
in
this
kind
of
case,
necessarily,
the
--
the
kind
of
restraint
that
you
have
here
suppresses
competition.
conceivably,
the
rule
of
reason
would
permit
a
defense
based
upon
a
legitimate
business
aim.
conceivably,
let
--
let
us
say
the
defendants
might
have
argued
that
they
entered
into
this
agreement
because
klor's
never
paid
his
bills
or
because
he
rendered
poor
service
to
his
customers.
now,
i
would
doubt
very
much
whether
it
consistently
with
this
court's
decisions
as
to
the
per
se
illegality
of
a
group
boycott,
even
that
kind
of
defense
had
it
been
asserted
would
be
valid.
i
--
i
should
suppose
that
the
fashion
originators'
guild
case
where
--
where
the
boycott
was
--
was
allegedly
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
unfair
competition
of
style
pirates
and
the
kiefer-stewart
case
in
340
u.s.
where
the
boycott
was
intended
to
meet
the
--
meet
--
meet
the
competition
of
--
of
others
who
are
alleged
to
be
violating
the
sherman
act
themselves.
and
in
both
cases,
this
court
said
that's
no
defense.
i
would
suppose
that
kind
of
defense
would
not
be
sufficient
here,
but
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
defendants
didn't
attempt
to
--
to
make
out
any
kind
of
excuse
or
justification
under
the
rule
of
reason.
what
they're
saying
here
is
that
under
the
rule
of
reason,
you
can
make
a
factual
inquiry
which
is
dispositive
as
to
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
as
to
whether,
in
addition
to
the
plaintiffs
being
damaged,
the
public
is
being
damaged.
now,
it
because
they
apparently
recognized
the
breadth
to
this
argument,
it
would
--
it
would
mean
that
a
plaintiff
who
was
eliminated
entirely
from
the
market,
and
this
--
this
complaint
here
alleges
only
that
a
great
many
suppliers
into
this
conspiracy,
not
all
of
them,
but
suppose
it
had
alleged
that
every
manufacturer
had
refused
to
sell
to
klor's
with
the
effect
that
he
was
totally
driven
out
of
business.
well,
the
rationale
of
the
decision
below
as
professor
handler
has
pointed
out,
in
his
discussion
of
this
case
in
the
new
york
city
bar
association
record,
the
rationale
of
this
--
of
this
decision
is
that
there's
no
injury
to
the
public
because
you
have
all
these
other
retailers
around
and
you
have
no
rise
in
prices,
no
--
or
go
no
violation
of
the
law.
now,
the
--
the
defendants
say,
“well,
you
can't
carry
it
that
far
because
if
you've
got
price
fixing,
that
is
--
that
is
automatically
a
forbidden
restraint,
it
is
automatically
injury
to
the
public.
now,
of
course,
one
might
answer
that
a
group
boycott
is
just
as
much
a
per
se
--
per
se
restraint
as
a
--
as
a
price
fixing
agreement,
but
--
but
apart
from
that,
the
argument,
it
seems
to
us,
emphasizes
the
incongruity
and
one
might
even
say
the
absurdity
of
the
--
of
the
line
that
sought
to
be
drawn
here.
because
suppose
this
--
this
complaint,
instead
of
alleging
that
there
was
an
unqualified
refusal
to
sell
to
klor's,
suppose
it
had
alleged
that
they
had
qualified
it,
that
these
manufacturers
have
gotten
together
and
they
had
said,
“well,
we'll
sell
to
klor's
but
only
on
condition
that
he
pay
5%
more
than
every
other
retailer
in
san
francisco
pay.”
now,
under
the
respondent's
theory,
that's
price
fixing
and
it's
public
injury,
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
anybody
besides
klor's
was
--
was
hurt.
and
yet,
in
that
situation,
the
--
the
public
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
be
affected
to
any
greater
extent
than
here
and
i
suppose
they'd
be
better
off
because
klor's
would
still
be
in
business
and
he
would
have
to
compete
with
his
neighbors
and
he
couldn't
raise
prices.
and
--
so
that
--
so
that
the
practical
matter
under
the
--
under
the
theory
here,
a
qualified
refusal
to
sell
produces
one
result,
and
an
unqualified
refusal
which
is
even
worse,
produces
another.
now,
if
there's
one
act
on
the
--
on
the
books
which
shouldn't
be
construed
in
such
a
--
a
mechanical
way,
i
should
suppose
it
was
the
sherman
act,
the
whole
--
mr.
philip
elman
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
would
like
to
point
--
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
but
i
should
like
--
mr.
philip
elman
exactly.
mr.
philip
elman
you
have
a
specific
--
mr.
philip
elman
exactly.
you
see,
you
have
a
specific
provision
in
the
--
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
section
5,
that
qualifies
the
power
of
the
commission
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
you
there
--
you've
got
to
show
the
proceeding
is
in
the
public
interest.
there
is
no
such
provision.
mr.
philip
elman
proceeding,
instead.
mr.
justice
brandeis
pointed
out
in
the
--
in
the
classic
case,
the
(inaudible)
case
here
in
the
district.
you
have
no
such
provision
in
the
sherman
act.
you
have
no
de
minimis
requirement
in
--
in
the
sherman
act.
and
it
--
it's
--
there
is
--
there's
a
suggestion
here,
and
perhaps
it's
more
than
a
suggestion
and
perhaps
may
explain
this
decision
below.
the
suggestion
is
that
this
is
a
petty
squabble,
this
is
a
trivial
case,
it's
an
unimportant
case.
and
because
it's
an
unimportant
case,
it
meant
--
it
was
the
kind
of
case
that
the
government
wouldn't
bring.
now,
that
may
very
well
be
true.
it
may
very
well
be
--
be
the
case
that
--
that
this
is
--
this
is
a
--
this
sort
of
violation
of
the
sherman
--
sherman
law
that
the
department
of
justice
with
its
necessarily
limited
manpower
resources
would
not
deal
with.
but
the
department
of
justice
does
not
undertake
and
it's
not
charged
by
congress
with
the
duty
of
undertaking,
enforce
every
violation
of
sherman
law
because
--
because
congress
has
relied
on
the
private
damage
remedy
for
enforcement
of
the
--
of
the
act,
as
well
as
upon
the
department
of
justice.
and
it's
a
--
it's
a
truism
which
this
court
has
pointed
out
many
times
that
the
private
damage
remedy
has
the
merit
of
building
into
this
sherman
law
a
--
a
self-policing
device.
now,
if
--
if
a
case
is
too
small
for
the
department
of
justice
to
bring
because
the
theory
--
the
theory
of
the
act
is
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
kind
of
case
that
the
person
immediately
damaged
by
is
likely
to
move
to
protect
its
--
in
his
own
interest.
it
would
seem
--
it
seem
to
us
to
be
almost
ironical,
as
well
as
unjust
to
deny
relief
to
a
--
to
a
small
man
on
that
ground.
and
as
judge
learned
hand
pointed
out
in
his
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
act
in
the
--
in
the
aluminum
case,
that
the
--
the
dominant
theme
of
--
of
the
legislation
in
the
--
in
the
expression
by
the
responsible
congressman
is
that
the
act
was
intended
to
protect
the
--
the
individual
against
large
aggregations,
large
combinations
of
an
economic
power.
and
i
should
suppose
that
the
smaller
the
individual,
the
greater
his
need
of
protection.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
the
decision.
and
--
and
then
it
arises
in
a
factual
context
where
--
where
the
--
the
defendant
is
not
woodward
&
lothrop
but
let's
say
a
shoe
store
on
the
corner
of
11th
street
in
pennsylvania
avenue
--
mr.
philip
elman
that
was
kershner.
well,
kershner
was
an
unfair
competition
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
elman
it
is
no
problem
in
this
case
about
the
interstate
commerce.
you've
got
interstate
--
you've
got
big
interstate
business
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned.
mr.
philip
elman
a
little
fellow.
but
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
it's
--
you've
got
--
you've
got
a
little
man
across
the
street
from
woodward
&
lothrop
or
across
the
street
from
macy's
saying
that
macy's
went
to
all
his
big
suppliers
and
said
to
them,
“you
enter
an
agreement
with
each
other
binding
each
of
you
not
to
sell
to
this
little
fellow
across
the
street
for
me
for
reasons
which
are
not
disclosed
or
at
least
for
reasons
which
are
not
specifically
alleged
in
the
complaint.”
and
of
course,
there's
no
requirement
to
the
--
in
the
complaint,
in
an
antitrust
case,
that
should
be
more
specific
or
more
particularized
than
in
the
other
cases.
the
court
held
in
the
employing
plasterers
case,
so
they're
consistently
with
these
general
allegations
of
the
complaint.
if
this
case
were
allowed
to
go
to
trial,
we
don't
know
what
--
what
would
develop.
it
might
possibly
be
that
price
is
involved.
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
why
they
went
after
klor's
except
that
it
was
for
an
anti-competitive
reason.
he
was
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
his
--
of
his
next-door
neighbor
and
--
and
to
eliminate
him
to
the
extent
of
depriving
him
of
--
of
access
to
these
appliances,
this
agreement
was
made.
and
the
courts
below
said,
“klor's
is
just
a
drop
in
the
bucket.
as
long
as
there's
enough
water
there
for
other
people,
the
fact
that
he's
been
eliminated
really
doesn't
hurt
anybody
except
him.
it's
not
a
public
wrong.”
mr.
philip
elman
and
--
and
what
--
what
it
comes
down
to
is
--
is
saying
that
even
though
the
sherman
act
was
intended
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
public
wrong,
still,
a
court
has
to
find
in
the
particular
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
alleged
and
proved
that
not
merely
the
plaintiff
was
hurt,
but
a
lot
of
other
people
besides.
mr.
philip
elman
complaint
--
the
complaint
just
said
--
the
complaint
just
alleges
the
agreement
and
says
that
his
--
that
the
defendant
hale
was
doing
it
from
monopolistic
purposes.
and
so,
we
don't
know
the
precise
reason.
mr.
philip
elman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
would
--
i
would
suppose
that
judge
barnes,
being
familiar
with
san
francisco,
would've
noted
this
the
highly
--
highly
concentrated
areas
so
far
as
retail
dealers
are
concerned.
i
don't
know
that
it
means
that
there
was
active
price
competition
as
a
fair
trade
law
in
--
in
california,
but
there
might
be
competition
as
to
service,
trade
and
allowances
and
the
like.
thank
you
very
much.
