you
be

to
state
the
case
in

in
its

(voice

significant
in
what
you've
just
called
our

what
do
you
--
go
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
also
state,
before
you
get
in
argument,
what
conceive
to
be
issues
before
this
court.
what
do
you
conceive
besides
the
questions
on
which
you
see
the
favorable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
just
want
--
and
they
just
want
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
exactly
the
correction
i
assumed
you
will
try
that
no
decision
of
this
court,
the
period
of
cases
even
with
problems,
if
we
have
any,
has
decided
this
particular
question
you
just
raised,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
happen
to
know
that
we've
already
reached
a
favorable
result
your
way.
we
should
overrule
or
qualify
and
if
i
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
before
you
do
that,
i
was
looking
--
whether
the
--
which
is
just
extension
opinion,
dealt
with
the
bearing
of
adversity
upon
problem
now
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
--
was
affixed
to
the
(inaudible)
to
take
a
case
by
the
board
or
anybody
seizing
for
it
based,
so
far
as
there's
any
--
avowal
of
their
action,
the
reasons
for
their
action.
did
they
say
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
technical
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
say
exercising
the
discretion
that
the
board
has
as
to
what
cases
be
taken
and
what
not
be
taken
in
the
inevitable
character
making
that
determination.
they
thought
this
wasn't
the
case
for
them
to
take
up,
which
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
not
the
statutes
already
excluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
kind
of
unfair
as
denounced
by
what
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
federal
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt
you
again
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
plant?
up
to
that
point,
then
we
have
a
situation
where
the
national
board
declined
to
take
and
please
itself
of
jurisdiction.
and
the
state
court
however,
found
a
violation
of
the
national
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
you
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
press
this
point,
forgive
me
but
i
think
--
it's
my
way
of
thinking
about
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it
was
privileged
or
not,
there
was
the
determination
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
national
act
by
the
state
authority
after
the
national
board
had
declined
to
find
out
whether
there
was
or
there
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
which
constitutes,
you
said
a
violation
of
both
state
and
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
a
way,
in
saying
that
and
at
least,
i
think
pass
on
or
pass
over
or
include
what
is
the
essential
practice
in
this
case.
namely,
is
it
also
state
law
if
the
federal
law
may
determine
that
there
wasn't
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
therefore,
the
foundation
of
the
state
judgment
is
gone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
--
i
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
enough
of
with
having
it
appear,
if
one
analyzes
it,
and
that's
what
it
gets
down
to.
because
if
a
chance,
state
labor
boards
had
taken
or
could
take
jurisdiction,
i
--
i
don't
know
anything
about
statute
of
limitations
and
all
the
rest.
suppose
the
labor
board
changes
its
mind
and
what
if
they
put
a
jurisdiction
precisely
at
the
same
time
that
a
case
is
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
reach
a
contrary
conclusion
and
then
the
state
court
couldn't
say
--
couldn't
start
to
discourage
them,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
it
--
wasn't
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
that
the
starting
point
of
the
first
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
that
--
wasn't
that
assumed
that
it
were
under
section
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
course,
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
defend
here
and
say
to
us
that
there
is
no
preemption,
there
can't
be
no
preemption
because
california
was
in
the
scope
of
its
own
state
authority
as
condemned
conduct
no
matter
what
the
labor
board
says
in
another
relationship
or
another
situation.
and
the
two
are
not
in
conflict
in
the
sense
in
which
one
talks
about
conflict,
that's
a
different
story.
and
i
take
it
that's
the
--
that's
ultimately
in
what
the
laburnum
doctrine
gets
down
to.
they're
--
they're
throwing
bricks
even
though
in
part
involving
or
growing
out
over
its
relation
to
what
some
other
aspects
of
the
labor
controversies,
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
unless
congress
or
where
the
constitution
could.
no,
no
--
not
that
having
conflict,
take
the
whole
thing
over.
it's
the
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
involved
in
the
determination
of
whether
there
is
or
isn't
of
proscribed
or
a
permitted
conduct
under
the
labor
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
try
in
order
--
in
order
to
deny
--
in
order
to
say
no.
this
decision
does
not
derive
from
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
taft-hartley
act.
you
must
find
some
independent
unrelated
prohibition
by
the
state
of
california
which
we
follow
to
do
so
to
condemn
the
conduct
that
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
the
law
was
--
the
second
decision
is
the
state
law
that
you
give
damages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
that
--
i
know
the
(inaudible)
as
i'm
talking
about,
to
remedial
matters
as
against
subsequent.
but
that
is
merely
by
two
--
whether
in
the
california
law,
although
you
can't
get
an
injunction
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
forth
in
the
following
adjustments,
although
you
can't
get
an
injunction,
may
under
california
law,
get
damages.
but
the
substantive
--
the
substantive
starting
point
is
this
thing
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that's
the
--
that
the
damage
relief
is
in
relation
to
the
substantive
--
the
same
substantive
matter
for
which
an
injunction
couldn't
be
granted
according
to
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
interrupting
you
so
much
is,
these
are
very
tricky
--
these
are
very
--
almost
you
might
call
a
subtle
distinction
the
court
has
had
to
go.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
i
think
one
has
to
watch
each
step
if
he
--
if
he
were
to
put
--
to
putting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
when
--
you
are
very
confident
about
that.
how
can
one
be
so
sure
that
the
board
wouldn't
find
that
it
wasn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
does
that
--
does
that
conclusion
follow
from
--
or
is
that
not
permit
the
conclusion
that
--
for
them
to
picket
without
violence
is
not
compelling
the
employer
to
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
said
that,
has
gone
a
long
way
to
illuminate
the
whole
problem
(inaudible)
namely,
that
if
in
such
a
due
tribunal,
one
federal
and
one
state
which
may
without
going
on
a
joy
ride
and
without
going
on
a
frolic
of
their
own,
breach
of
determination
during
conflicts
then
you've
got
the
problem
of
whether
that
potential
conflict
couldn't
--
could
be
avoided
by
saying
that
the
act
of
congress
has
displaced
the
power
of
the
state.
now
when
you
deal
with
violence,
you've
got
a
different
story,
because
as
violence
plays
--
violence
plays
a
different
story
in
all
that
in
a
very
(inaudible)
of
the
law,
takes
the
coerced
confessions.
one
thing
to
the
--
the
disputes
we
have
about
whether
voluntary
or
not
in
your
dispute
if
you
got
without
a
question
of
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
of
my
questions,
to
elicit
comments
and
illuminate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suggested
the
fact
that
is
--
what
you're
doing
is
to
cast
some
--
that's
a
very
different
difficulties
about
laburnum
as
others
have
raised
difficulties.
but
i
do
think
the
danger
that
where
a
case
comes
to
this
court,
our
unquestioned
findings
that
there
was
violence,
that
the
labor
board
made
in
the
context
of
the
whole
labor
strategy
of
the
strike
go
on
controversies,
find
there
wasn't
any
violence,
is
a
thing
that
this
court
can
say.
it
is
not
so
important,
the
danger
of
potential
conflict
as
in
state
and
federal
authority
as
if
the
case
where
conceded
and
you
have
no
violence
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
--
well,
all
of
it
this
which
is
why
we're
telling
this
also
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
a
non-demonstration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
this
court
have
said,
that's
--
as
i
would
have
guessed
--
called
it
in.
that
--
that
kind
of
strike
did
not
displace
the
authority
of
the
states
to
deal,
where
you
have
goon
squads
on
one
side
and
--
and
violence
on
the
other
but
that
did
not
displace
what
is
--
what
i
might
call
elementary
police
power
to
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
gave
us
all
these
troubles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
okay
a
comment.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
distinction
between
giving
injunctive
remedy
as
an
expression
of
state
policy
which
this
court
have
included
in
this
kind
of
a
case
and
giving
money
damage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
as
to
the
starting
point
from
which
the
money
damage
flows,
and
be
ascertained
by
the
state
court's
order
says
and
within
refusal
of
the
board
to
give
a
cease
and
desist
order
because
on
their
view
of
the
testimony,
find
out
of
it
and
what
the
state
court
is
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
can
we
assume
that
if
the
board
found
--
the
fact
that
the
state
courts
found
this,
it
wouldn't
grant
this
in
this
order
if
the
board
--
when
does
the
board,
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
act,
decline
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order.
when
before
--
which
this
conflict
arise
being
a
remedy
denied
by
the
board
within
its
discretion
and
yet
granted
analogous
to
by
the
state
court
by
way
of
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
helped
me
to
be
more
troubled
than
i
have
already
been
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
well
now,
justice
treanor's
next
point
was
that
the
state
in
the
laburnum
case
was
enforcing
a
law
of
general
application
rather
than
one
and
specifically
at
labor
relations.
and
in
this
connection,
he
refers
to
the
court's
--
this
court's
statement
in
that
case
that
if
petitioners
were
unorganized
private
persons
conducting
themselves
as
did
petitioners
here,
virginia
would
have
undoubted
jurisdiction
of
this
action.
well,
that
to
me
is
a
distinction
which
makes
no
difference.
it
really
isn't
a
distinction
because
here,
the
california
court
was
not
applying
a
basic
rule
of
law
which
is
simply
the
product
of
a
labor
relation
statute.
it,
like
the
virginia
court,
was
applying
a
rule
of
law
which
says
in
substance
that
an
unprivileged
interference
with
the
business
of
another
is
tortuous.
it
has
no
particular
application
to
labor
unions
and
here,
as
in
the
laburnum
case.
if
a
group
of
private
unorganized
citizens
had
gotten
out
in
front
of
this
man's
place
of
business
and
conducted
themselves
as
to
these
pickets,
it
would
have
been
tortuous.
their
conduct
would
not
have
been
privileged.
suppose
they
had
been
picketing,
they
were
employees
of
the
competitor
and
were
picketing
to
drive
business
to
the
competitor,
would
that
have
been
privileged?
now,
here,
just
as
in
the
laburnum
case,
picketing
by
unorganized
individuals
would
have
been
tortuous
and
there
would
have
been
liability.
the
fact
that
conduct
such
as
that
about
which
we're
here
complaining
is
simply
a
violation
of
this
rule
against
unprivileged
interference,
is
exemplified
by
a
decision
written
by
justice
brandeis.
in
the
case
of
dorchy
versus
kansas,
272
u.s.
306,
where
there
was
a
strike
to
force
payment
of
a
disputed
wave
plan
--
wage
plan.
and
justice
brandeis
said
this
about
it,
“the
right
to
carry
on
business,
be
it
cause
liberty
or
property
has
value.
to
interfere
with
this
right
without
just
cause
is
unlawful.”
now,
that's
simply
the
basic
rule
which
has
been
applied
here
just
as
in
the
laburnum
case.
and
i
cannot
see
that
there
is
any
distinction
on
that
respect
between
them.
but
let
us
suppose
that
the
california
law
were
a
law,
simply
a
labor
relation
statute,
that's
happening
in
some
states.
why
would
that
make
a
difference?
why
would
the
nature
of
the
statute
and
the
source
of
the
substantive
rule,
which
we're
applying
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
or
was
not
preemption?
i
just
don't
see
any
materiality
to
the
problem
before
us.
and
the
fact
is
that
this
court
in
the
anheuser-busch
case
seem
to
say
that
the
nature
of
the
statute
is
immaterial.
whether
the
state
is
enforcing
an
antitrust
law
or
a
labor
statute,
the
result
is
the
same
and
that's
what
we're
interested
in.
now,
having
concluded
that
the
laburnum
case
was
not
in
point
and
that
the
question
for
it
there
had
or
had
not
been
decided,
you
would
have
thought
that
the
dissent
would
have
then
looked
to
the
statute
to
see
if
there
was
anything
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
this
man
was
left
without
any
remedies.
but
it
didn't
look
at
the
statute
from
the
premise
that
the
point
had
not
yet
been
decided
by
this
court
has
simply
dealt
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
preemption.
now,
that
conclusion
i
submit
as
well
as
the
premise,
the
conclusion
is
unjustified.
the
garner
case,
if
i
read
it
correctly,
was
based
upon
the
language
of
the
act
which
confers
power
upon
the
board
to
prevent
unfair
labor
practices.
and
this
court
concluded
that
a
state
court
injunction
might
conflict
with
the
board's
exercise
of
this
parallel
preventative
power.
the
guss
case
and
this
case,
one
of
these
before
you
before
held
that
this
preemption
extended
to
the
twilight
zone.
because
the
only
way
in
which
the
board's
power
to
prevent
could
be
seated
to
a
state
was
through
the
--
the
session
proceedings
provided
for
--
for
by
section
10
(a).
now,
that
reasoning
of
course
simply
could
not
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
state
was
deprived
the
power
to
award
damages.
the
state's
power
to
act,
certainly,
cannot
depend
upon
session
by
the
board
of
a
power
which
the
board
does
not
have
and
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
award
damages.
the
very
section
which
confers
upon
the
board
its
power
to
prevent
provided
that
this
power
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
means
of
adjustment
or
prevention
that
has
been
or
may
be
established
by
agreement,
law,
or
otherwise.
now,
this
seems
to
contemplate
that
there
may
be
other
means
of
adjustment.
and
it
says
that
the
fact
that
there
are
other
means
of
adjustment
shall
not
affect
the
board's
power,
shall
not
deprive
it
of
power.
now,
just
what
did
congress
understand
that
provision
to
mean?
it
didn't
leave
us
in
the
dark
as
to
that.
it
said
something
which
has
been
quoted
in
prior
opinions
of
this
court.
it
said
that,
“by
retaining
the
language
which
provides
the
board's
powers
under
section
10
shall
not
be
affected
by
other
means
of
adjustment.
the
conference
agreement
makes
clear
that
when
two
remedies
exist,
one
before
the
board
and
one
before
the
courts,
the
remedy
before
the
board
shall
be
in
addition
to
and
not
in
lieu
of
other
remedies.”
now,
i
don't
know
what
clearer
statement
we
could
possibly
hope
for.
that
statement
couldn't
be
referring
simply
to
remedies
in
the
courts
under
section
303
of
the
act
because
the
language
to
which
it
refers
and
which
it
was
explaining
had
been
contained
in
the
wagner
act
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
section
303,
so
they
couldn't
simply
have
been
talking
about
remedies
in
the
courts
under
303.

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
much
interested
in
the
use
to
making
it
to
your
brief,
i
say
i'm
much
interested
in
the
use
to
making
it
to
your
brief.
we
--
we're
not
interested
on
that
because
i
just
thought
there's
no
--
that
section
to
me
is
nothing
but
confliction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
few
words.
i'm
not
sure
i
have
it
clearly
in
mind,
what
significance,
if
any,
you
would
have
found
the
element
of
violence
which
certainly
was
present
in
laburnum
and
it
dealt
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
--
what
do
say
to
mr.
plant's
suggestion
that
the
relief
the
remedy
which
is
available
to
the
board
at
least
in
to
this
court
is
analogous
to
it
and
therefore
maybe
in
conflict
with
an
injunction
by
the
state
court,
but
those
in
conflict
can
possibly
arise
in
giving
damages
--
that's
with
damages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
argument,
i
hope
i
indicated
difficulties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
first
--
is
that
the
first
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
--
is
there
anything
in
the
second
opinion,
the
january
16th
of
last
year
except
inferentially
that
the
court
still
stands
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
inconsistency
here
results
except
wholly
abstractness?
in
other
words,
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
this
type
of
case,
whether
--
and
forgetting
for
the
moment
guss,
as
you
said
affirming
this
case.
putting
that
to
one
side
for
the
moment,
compares
that.
in
this
case,
in
this
very
case
or
in
this
type
of
case,
namely
where
the
board
refused
to
take
hold
in
accordance
to
this
administrative
restriction,
self
imposed,
the
administrative
restriction,
than
you'll
ever
have
a
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
abstractly
considered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
in
fact,
it
refused
to
take
hold
and
where
in
fact
the
san
diego
state
council
didn't
press
that
or
didn't
try
to
assert
to
that
unfair
labor
practice,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
fact,
now,
i'm
asking
to
whether
this
can
be
the
fact
that
--
that
the
congress,
on
which
your
whole
argument
ultimately
stress,
isn't
an
abstract
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
why
the
union
are
helpless
creatures
and
can't
show
that
the
complaints
that
was
sought
to
be
filed
was
--
was
purposely
diluted
or
that
they
can't
actively
themselves
file
as
you
claim,
a
violation
of
the
labor
board
as
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
board,
the
remedy
is
always
that
the
board
could
take
hold,
then
there's
no
problem,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
and
the
board
doesn't
take
hold
presumably,
thus
refuse
to
take
hold
for
some
--
for
some
sound
and
must
refused
it
at
some
--
some
--
not
unworthy
reasons
of
administration,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
here
that
the
statute
is
--
it
construe
in
the
administrative
application
made
of
it
by
the
board
that
this
thing
is
to
be
modeled
out
instead
of
litigated
out,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
say
--
or
that
i
don't
think
that
--
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
be
real,
what
is
called
realistic.
that's
what
it
gets
down
to,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
appeal
for
the
intention
of
congress
and
you
must
rest
on
the
proposition
that
congress,
by
allowing
the
board,
will
shed
itself
of
--
of
actions
or
revolve
any
actions.
congress
meant
to
say
they
should
be
left
to
the
economic
context.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wan
to
know
what
this
gets
down
to.
