mr.
marion
b.
plant
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
other
members
of
this
honorable
court.
i
think
that
the
case
would
be
a
little
bit
clearer
in
my
mind
not
in
minds
of
the
court
if
i
reviewed
briefly
the
background
as
i
understand
it
to
be.
there
was
a
picket
line
established
by
the
petitioners
here.
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
the
nature
of
that
picketing
which
dispute
was
resolved
by
the
trial
court.
and
this
findings
of
fact
were
held
upon
field
to
be
supported
by
the
evidence.
and
why
when
i
state
the
facts,
i'm
not
stating
our
version
of
the
facts
or
the
union's
version
of
the
facts
but
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court.
and
the
facts
found
were
these.
that
the
unions
had
presented
the
employer
with
a
contract
which
contained
a
union
shop
clause
that
they
had
demand
--
demanded
that
he
sign
it.
that's
when
he
refused
to
do
so
because
his
employees
had
not
designated
the
union
as
their
bargain
--
bargaining
representative,
and
apparently
didn't
want
it.
they
established
the
picket
line
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
him
to
sign
this
contract
and
thus,
to
interfere
with
his
employees
and
their
free
choice
of
the
bargaining
representative
and
to
discriminate
them
against
them
for
failure
to
join
this
union.
now,
those
are
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court.
the
activity
was
the
activity
of
a
stranger
union.
the
national
labor
relations
board
through
its
general
counsel
declined
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
representation
matter
because
the
impact
of
the
employer's
business
on
commerce
was
so
slight
that
the
board
did
not
think
that
the
matter
required
its
attention.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no,
they
just
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
they
--
and
i
--
i
think
that
it
was
in
the
exercise
of
their
discretion,
may
determine
that
the
case
did
not
meet
their
jurisdictional
standards,
so-called.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
they
determined
that
the
case
did
not
meet
their
monetary
standards.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no,
i
--
i
don't
know
what
case
would
fall
without
the
statutes.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
now,
the
trial
court
awarded
an
injunction
and
damages.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
california
supreme
court
after
it
--
action
by
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
the
california
supreme
court
affirmed.
in
doing
so,
it
followed
a
doctrine
which
had
a
--
had
enunciated
some
years
before
in
the
park
&
tilford
case.
it
said
that
--
that
this
--
it
would
be
against
public
policy
for
this
employer
to
enter
into
a
bargaining
contract
with
this
union
because
if
it
were
to
do
so,
or
a
closed
shop
contract.
because
if
it
were
to
do
so,
it
would
be
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
picketing
for
the
purpose
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
under
the
federal
act.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes.
the
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
an
employer
to
do
that
which
public
policy
for
--
forbids,
is
for
a
wrongful
purpose
and
is
not
privileged.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
that
is
not
quite
a
complete
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
there
were
two
possible
violations
that
the
federal
act
involved.
one
would
have
been
the
act
of
the
employer
in
contracting
with
the
union.
if
he
had
done
so.
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
national
act.
and
under
the
law
of
california,
even
though
the
picketing
itself
would
not
have
been
--
been
a
violation
of
the
national
act,
it
nevertheless
would
have
tortuous
because
it
was
for
the
wrongful
purpose
of
compelling
the
employer
to
violate
the
paramount
public
policy.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
of
the
federal
government.
now,
an
additional
answer
to
the
union's
contention
that
the
picketing,
nevertheless
was
privileged
had
the
court
replied
while
the
picketing
itself
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
we
will
not
treat
as
privileged
under
california
law
that
which
the
federal
act
condemns.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
we
therefore
find
the
distortions.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes,
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
this
picketing
violated
the
--
the
national
act.
now,
the
case
came
up
to
this
court
and
this
court
decided
it
the
same
day
as
it
decided
the
guss
case
and
the
fairlawn
meats
case
and
held
as
it
did
in
those
cases
that
under
the
doctrine
of
the
garner
case,
the
state
court
was
without
power
to
issue
injunctive
relief.
it
said
that
the
fact
that
the
case
fell
in
this
twilight
zone
was
immaterial
because
the
only
way
that
the
national
board
can
cede
to
a
state
its
power
to
prevent
was
the
method
proscribed
by
section
10
(a)
of
the
act.
however,
the
employer
argued
that
though
the
state
court
was
deprived
the
power
to
grant
injunctive
relief,
it
nevertheless
was
empowered
to
award
damages.
and
to
follow
on
that
question,
this
court
said
this,
“respondents
however,
argue
that
the
award
of
damages
must
be
sustained.
we
do
not
reach
this
question.
the
california
supreme
court
leaves
us
in
doubt,
but
its
opinion
indicates
that
it
felt
bound
to
apply
or
in
some
sense
follow
federal
law
in
this
case.
there
is
of
course
no
such
compulsion.
laburnum
sustained
an
award
of
damages
under
state
court
law
for
violent
conduct.
we
cannot
know
that
the
california
court
would
have
interpreted
its
own
state
law
to
allow
an
award
of
damages
in
this
different
situation.”
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
california
supreme
court
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
it
to
determine
whether
there
was
liability
for
damages
under
the
state
law
of
california.
the
state
court
reviewed
that
question
and
determined
that
that
section
923
of
the
california
labor
code,
like
a
similar
provision
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
rendered
it
against
public
policy
for
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
employees
because
of
union
membership
or
left
thereof
or
to
otherwise
interfere
with
them
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights.
and
that
for
that
reason,
the
picketing
was
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
the
employer
to
a
violative
public
policy
of
the
state
of
california
and
it
was
tortuous.
it
therefore
affirmed
the
award
of
damages,
and
here
we
are
again.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no
violence.
now,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
presenting
to
the
senate
the
bill
which
had
been
reported
out
of
the
committee
and
which
was
certain
amendments
later
became
the
taft-hartley
act.
senator
taft
made
a
--
a
comprehensive
explanation
of
its
contents
to
the
senate
and
right
at
the
beginning
of
that
explanation
in
his
introductory
remarks,
he
had
this
to
say,
“i
myself
feel
that
large
employers
can
well
look
after
themselves.
but
throughout
the
united
states,
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
smaller
employers,
smaller
businessmen
who,
under
the
existing
statutes,
have
come
gradually
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
labor
union
meetings,
either
labor
union
leaders
attempting
to
organize
their
employees
or
labor
union
leaders
interfering
with
a
conduct
of
their
business
for
one
reason
or
another.”
now,
throughout
the
debate,
they
ran
this
theme
of
concern
for
the
small
employer
of
the
need
to
give
him
additional
protection
against
various
union
abuses,
and
it
was
upon
that
theme
that
the
debate
closed.
in
presenting
the
closing
argument
in
favor
of
overriding
the
present
--
presidential
veto,
senator
taft
again
said.
“all
we
have
tried
to
do
is
swing
that
balance
back
not
too
far
to
a
point
where
the
parties
can
deal
equally
with
each
other
and
where
they
have
approximately
--
approximately
equal
power.
i
think
the
largest
companies
today
can
deal
with
their
employees
throughout
the
nation.
but
the
smaller
companies
are
practically
at
the
mercy
of
a
labor
union
process.”
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
you
have
before
you
a
small
employer.
he
has
been
injured
by
conduct
which
is
condemned
both
by
the
federal
law
and
by
the
law
of
the
state.
he
has
been
denied
reliefs
under
federal
law
because
the
impact
of
his
business
upon
interstate
commerce
is
so
slight
that
the
board
does
not
consider
the
matter
worth
its
attention.
he
has
been
denied
injunctive
relief
under
state
law
because
the
board's
power
to
prevent
is
exclusive
of
parallel
power
upon
the
part
of
the
states.
and
because
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
provides
the
only
method
by
which
the
board
can
cede
to
a
state
this
power
to
prevent.
and
now
we
are
here
with
the
petitioners
condemn
--
contending
that
not
only
is
this
employer
deprived
of
all
right
with
any
kind
of
preventative
relief,
but
that
he
has
--
is
also
deprived
of
a
right
of
action
for
damages.
now,
if
the
petitioners
are
correct
in
this
contention,
then
it
means
that
this
employer
who
has
been
injured
by
conduct,
which
violates
both
state
and
federal
law
and
for
which
each
provides
remedies,
is
without
any
remedy
whatever.
if
--
and
the
same
is
true
or
will
be
true
of
thousands
of
other
employers
like
him.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
right.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
of
course
you're
quite
true,
your
honor,
that
the
federal
substantive
law
where
it
applies
supersedes
state
law
and
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
otherwise.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
it
might
reach
a
contrary
conclusion
as
to
the
facts.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
i
--
i
think
it
could
for
this
reason,
your
honor,
that
the
question
whether
the
employer
would
be
violating
the
--
well,
wait,
let's
--
let's
come
back
just
a
moment
here.
i'm
overlooking
something.
the
last
decision
of
the
california
court
was
not
based
upon
federal
law.
so
that,
when
i
am
--
when
i
say
that
the
conduct
is
condemned
by
federal
law,
i
am
not
relying
upon
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
to
that
effect.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
i'm
relying
simply
on
my
own
knowledge
of
the
board
and
the
court's
decisions.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
that
was
the
starting
point
of
the
first
decision.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
i
don't
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
it
was
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
maybe
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
we
have
that,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
as
i
say
was
--
the
second
decision
was
based
purely
upon
california
law.
the
only
way
the
federal
authority
comes
into
the
picture
is
through
the
argument
that
the
thread
--
federal
authority
precludes
the
state
from
acting.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
in
the
first
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
right.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
the
same
in
the
two
cases?
mr.
marion
b.
plant
preventative
relief
and
damages?
mr.
marion
b.
plant
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
i've
seen
so
many
arguments
i
can't
recall,
[laughs]
your
honor.
but
no,
the
question
which
is
--
was
before
the
court,
now
is
not
before
it
in
the
guss
case.
i
would
say
that
i'm
taking
the
line
of
the
majority
of
the
opinion
in
the
laburnum
case.
i
haven't
got
quite
to
the
points
of
saying
why
yet.
i've
still
been
engaged
in
the
background
that
that
is
our
position,
that
the
laburnum
case
is
controlling.
now,
i
just
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
indeed
they
are.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes
indeed.
well
now,
i
just
want
to
point
out
before
launching
into
some
of
these
questions
that
have
been
raised
that
if
the
petitioners
are
correct
in
their
contention
in
this
case,
then
congress,
instead
of
succeeding
in
providing
small
employers
with
certain
additional
relief
has
succeeded
only
in
depriving
them
of
what
protection
that
they
already
have
until
we
have
an
area
created
--
the
congress
has
created,
a
jungle
area,
in
which
we
have
simply
an
argument.
it's
like
the
westerns
where
the
sheriff
is
the
only
law
except
up
here,
we'd
have
no
sheriff.
now,
i
think
that
the
arguments
set
forth
in
the
dissent
of
the
--
of
justice
treanor
in
the
court
below
fairly
represents
the
arguments
in
favor
of
the
petitioner's
position.
the
substance
of
that
argument
is
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
does
not
depend
solely
upon
the
nature
of
the
remedy,
but
depends
also
on
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter.
and
that
the
laburnum
case
is
distinguishable
because
it
involved
violence.
and
that
justice
treanor
sets
forth
four
or
five
considerations
which
he
regards
as
entering
into
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
preemption
in
the
particular
case
and
seems
to
believe
that
one
or
another
of
those
considerations
distinguishes
our
case
from
the
decision
in
the
laburnum
case.
and
with
that,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
justice
treanor.
first
of
all,
he
said
in
the
laburnum
case,
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
federal
and
state
law
because
the
conduct
was
a
tort
under
virginia
law
and
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
federal
statute.
we
have
the
same
case
here.
the
conduct
the
court
below
has
held
is
a
tort
under
the
california
law
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
it
was
also
an
unfair
labor
practice.
even
if
it
were
not
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it's
certainly
and
i
--
i
believe
that
i
can
support
this,
is
not
conduct
which
the
act
protects
so
that
there
is
no
conflict
in
the
substantive
law.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
if
the
board
found
that
it
was
protected,
your
honor,
the
board
will
be
wrong
and
would
be
reversed
by
this
court
because
i
don't
think
that
this
court
would
ever
hold
that
the
act
protects
conduct
designed
to
force
an
employer
to
do
that
which
the
act
forbids.
and
that
the
act
does
forbid
an
employer
from
entering
into
a
closed
shop
agreement
with
a
union
that
does
not
represent
its
employees,
is
very,
very
clear
indeed.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
it's
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
even
the
board
would
hold
that
that
conduct
was
protected
and
as
i
say,
i'm
quite
sure
that
if
the
case
were
before
this
court,
it
would
hold
that
it
wasn't
protected.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
the
idea
here
is
of
course
that
it's
always
possible.
when
a
factual
issue
is
presented
to
two
bodies
for
the
--
the
two
bodies
to
decide
that
issue
differently,
that's
something
we're
confronted
with
everyday.
that's
something
we're
confronted
with
under
the
taft-hartley
act
in
actions
in
part
under
section
303
and
an
unfair
labor
practice
charges
while
identical
issues
are
presented
to
the
court
and
to
the
board.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
--
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
as
just
heard
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
as
justice
stewart
said
yesterday,
the
fact
that
a
man
is
killed
does
not
mean
that
there
has
been
a
murder.
and
the
fact
that
there
is
violence
does
not
mean
that
is
unjustified,
they're
wrongful.
and
different
bodies
can
reach
different
conclusions
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
wrongful.
and
justice
treanor
remarked
in
this
case
that
here
in
the
laburnum
case,
there
was
violence.
well,
nobody
can
disagree
that
violence
is
wrong,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
board
repeatedly
in
the
past,
has
refused
to
credit
the
witnesses
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
credible
that
violence
had
been
committed.
the
board
repeatedly
in
the
past
has
held
that
violence
was
justified,
that
it
was
justified
by
some
unfair
labor
practice
of
the
employer
or
because
it
was
brought
about
by
the
employer.
i
need
refer
you
only
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
fansteel
case.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
i
--
i
just
don't
see
that
they
differ
a
bit,
your
honor
because
if
that
laburnum
case
had
been
presented
to
the
board,
it
might
very
well.
it's
entirely
conceivable.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
(inaudible)
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes.
or
it
might
have
said,
“sure,
there
was
violence
but
the
employer
had
goon
squads
out
there
beating
them
up
and
they
were
just
defending
themselves.”
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well
now,
let
--
let
me
point
this
out
to
your
honor.
after
all,
we
are
seeking
to
solve
the
question
of
congressional
intent.
if
congress
wasn't
at
least
a
bit
concerned
by
the
possibility
that
a
state
or
federal
court
might
decide
some
factual
issue
differently
from
the
board
then
i
submit
that
we
shouldn't
be
concerned.
now,
the
fact
is
that
congress
enacted
section
303
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
renders
certain
conduct
tortuous
in
terms
practically
identical
with
section
8
(b)
(4)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
characterizes
that
same
conduct
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
senator
morris
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
pointed
out
to
the
senate
that
the
danger
of
conflicting
adjudications
regarding
the
same
conduct
and
not
simply
conflict
--
conflicting
factual
adjudications
but
conflicting
interpretations
of
the
same
language
of
the
statute.
if
you
will
bear
with
me
just
a
minute,
i'll
cite
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
he
was
speaking
against
it.
he
said,
“i
do
want
to
make
the
additional
argument
against
the
taft
substitute,”
that
is
section
303.
“that
it
makes
it
possible
for
two
different
district
courts,”
and
he
omitted
state
court
--
state
court
too.
“and
the
nlrb
to
be
dealing
simultaneously
with
the
same
subject
matter.
the
board
would
be
conducted
a
--
conducting
a
hearing
look
--
looking
to
a
cease
and
desist
order.
at
the
same
time,
the
board
would
be
required
as
provided
in
the
committee
bill
on
which
i
shall
comment
in
the
moment
to
seek
injunctive
relief
which
means
that
--
that
there
would
be
two
of
the
actions
going
on
the
same
time
or
that
there
might
be.
well,
they
acquiesced
in
this
latter
provision
when
it
was
added
to
the
bill.
i
may
say
that
i
did
so
rather
reluctantly.
that
is
an
example
however
of
my
willingness
to
enter
into
reasonable
compromise
in
the
committee.
i
did
--
did
so
believing
that
the
best
procedure
would
have
been
to
make
it
discretionary
rather
than
mandatory
for
the
board
to
seek
injunctions.”
finally,
under
this
proposal,
we
have
a
third
agency,
probably
a
different
federal
court.
and
i
may
interpolate
perhaps
a
state
court
which
also
is
given
jurisdiction
by
that
section.
deciding
whether
a
damage
action
lies,
such
dispersion
of
authority
in
my
judgment
is
very
--
is
very
bad
legislative
policy.
now,
nevertheless,
and
then
base
to
that
warning,
the
congress
did
go
ahead
and
disperse
authority.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
i
[laughs]
--
sometimes
i
think
we
tend
to
create
some
of
our
own
troubles,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
now,
i
submit
that
congress
was
not
in
the
least
bit
concerned
over
the
possibility
that
a
federal
or
state
court
might
decide
a
factual
or
legal
issue
presented
under
section
303
than
the
board
might
decide
them
in
a
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
under
section
8
(b).
and
that
very
situation
has
risen.
there
was
an
instance
which
found
its
way
to
the
cross
appeal
in
which
the
board
where
there
was
a
proceeding
against
the
employer
for
having
wrongfully
discharged
some
men
and
who
contended
that
the
--
he
discharged
them
because
they
had
been
engaged
in
secondary
picketing.
the
board
found
there
was
no
secondary
picketing.
and
felt
the
employer
guilty
of
wrongfully
discharging
him.
but
the
jury
in
an
action
under
section
303
held
that
there
was
secondary
picketing
and
awarded
damages.
both
cases
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
affirm
the
law.
that
is
the,
our
deena
artware
case,
that
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
also
on
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
what
is
that?
mr.
marion
b.
plant
that's
not
our
brief,
your
honor.
our
brief
is
the
orange
one.
well,
it's
there
but
i
would
take
a
second
to
find
it.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes,
it's
here.
just
wait
a
second
and
i'll
get
it
for
you.
it
would
be
found
on
page
21.
now,
if
you'll
pardon
me
for
my
repeating
myself,
i
--
i
don't
think
this
court
should
be
too
concerned
about
a
problem
which
apparently
didn't
bother
congress
i
think.
apparently,
congress
thought
it
was
all
right
to
have
these
issues
decided
by
different
bodies.
and
after
all,
it
is
the
intent
of
the
congress
with
which
we
are
concerned.
and
i
might
add
that
there
is
much
less
danger
of
conflict
between
a
state
applying
state
law
and
the
federal
board
applying
state
law
--
federal
law,
then
there
is
a
conflict
between
two
bodies
applying
the
same
federal
law.
there
is
nothing
unnecessarily
inconsistent
or
necessarily
inconsistent
between
a
state's
holding
that
--
that
conflict
--
conduct
does
violate
state
law
and
the
board's
holding
that
it
does
not
violate
federal
law,
nor
is
there
anything
inconsistent
between
a
state's
holding
that
conduct
does
not
violate
state
law
and
the
board's
holding
that
it
does
violate
federal
law.
well
now,
the
fact
is
--
furthermore,
with
respect
to
this
question
of
violence
which
arose
a
moment
ago
that
the
laburnum
case
did
not
go
off
on
the
basis
of
violence.
now,
true,
there
was
violent
conduct
involved
in
that
case,
but
the
court's
decision
was
not
based
upon
that
ground.
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decision
was
simply
that
a
judgment
for
damages
did
not
present
any
potential
conflict
with
preventative
relief
by
the
board.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
the
main
distinction
is
this,
your
honor.
an
injunction
of
course
controls
future
conduct.
and
if
you
violate
the
injunction,
you're
likely
to
end
up
in
jail.
the
board
is
given
similar
power
to
prevent.
i
say
similar,
it's
not
quite
similar
in
this
respect
that
there
is
one
area
in
which
the
board
is
given
a
wide
discretion.
i
don't
think
that
the
board
has
given
any
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
or
has
not
been
an
unfair
labor
practice.
there,
the
function
is
simply
as
a
court
interpreting
and
applying
the
law.
but
when
it
comes
to
fashioning
the
preventative
remedy,
it
is
given
a
discretion.
and
what
the
state
does
by
way
of
a
preventative
remedy
may
very
well
interfere
with
what
the
board
sees
fit
to
do
by
way
of
prevention.
now,
that
is
not
true
in
the
case
of
a
judgment
for
damages.
a
judgment
for
damages
represents
an
attempt
to
compensate
a
person
for
injuries
already
sustained,
something
with
which
the
board
has
nothing
to
do.
it
has
no
power
of
any
kind
or
nature
with
respect
to
conduct
already
committed.
it
can
give
no
relief
of
any
kind
with
respect
to
such
conduct.
it
has
no
power
to
award
damages
and
there
is
just
no
possibility
of
conflict
between
the
two
remedies.
now
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
there's
always
that
possibility,
your
honor.
we
have
already
discussed
the
possibility
of
conflicting
findings
of
facts.
now,
if
the
substantive
law
conflicts,
that
presents
no
danger
because
if
the
act
--
if
the
state
endeavors
to
take
a
right
--
away
some
right,
which
is
conferred
by
the
federal
act,
then
that
will
be
corrected
upon
appeal
and
by
this
court
as
it
was
corrected
yesterday
in
the
case
which
came
up
from
ohio.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
an
example
doesn't
occur
to
me
off
hand,
your
honor.
the
usual
refusal
of
the
board
to
grant
relief
would
be
based
presumably
upon
finding
of
fact
or
an
interpretation
of
its
statute
contrary
to
what
you
might
expect.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
[laughs]
mr.
marion
b.
plant
i
find
nothing
to
indicate
it,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
remedies
they
had
in
the
federal
courts.
there
weren't
any
before
--
before
taft-hartley.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
right.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
right.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no.
it
says
before
the
courts.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no,
i
will
not
generalize
to
that
extent,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
my
point
is
--
my
point
is
simply
this.
we
can
qualify
that
by
saying,
“well,
when
they
said
remedies
in
the
courts,
they
didn't
mean
remedies
parallel
to
those
granted
by
the
board.
and
therefore,
the
courts
have
no
power
to
grant
a
parallel
remedy.
but
if
we
go
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
what
is
that?
mr.
marion
b.
plant
that's
right.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
that's
right.
but
we
can
interpret
it
to
that
extent
and
i
take
that
the
court
has
done
so
in
the
garner
case.
but
when
we
go
further
and
say
that
there
is
no
right
to
any
remedy
at
all,
then
we
have
deprived
this
language
of
all
meaning.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
what
is
your
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
i
think
it
demonstrates
the
congressional
approach,
your
honor.
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
the
congress
wasn't
much
worried
about
this
thing
we're
talking
about
now,
the
possibility
of
conflict.
well
now,
i
think
that
about
includes
me,
i'm
looking
through
my
notes.
i
think
i've
covered
in
answer
to
questions,
most
of
the
things
that
i've
intended
to
say,
if
not
all
of
them.
there
has
been
considerable
talk
in
the
opinions
about
the
uniformity
of
the
federal
law.
and
i
think
that
if
we
are
too
general
in
such
talk,
we're
liable
to
be
misled
because
the
labor
relations
act
does
not
attempt
to
impose
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
it
does
not
attempt
to
impose
a
uniform
form
of
code
of
labor
law,
which
is
to
be
exclusive
of
all
other
laws.
it
establishes
substance
--
certain
substantive
rules.
for
example,
the
rule
that
certain
conduct
is
to
be
protected
and
it
intends
uniformity
in
the
sense
that
it
means
that
that
is
to
be
protected
in
all
of
the
states
and
all
of
the
states
must
observe
those
rights
so
protected.
it
is
as
for
uniformity,
in
the
sense
that
it
creates
certain
to
the
wrongs
called
unfair
labor
practices
which
are
to
be
unfair
labor
practices
in
all
the
states
and
not
just
some
and
creates
a
board
to
enforce
them.
but
i
don't
think
it
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
states
may
not
also
enact
law
which
does
not
conflict
with
the
substantive
law
or
that
it
might
not
--
may
not
provide
remedies
for
violations
of
its
own
law.
now,
that
i
think
is
--
about
covers
the
ground
unless
there
are
some
further
questions.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
the
only
significance
i
attribute
to
the
presence
of
violence
in
that
case
was
that
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
it
rendered
the
union's
conduct
tortuous.
now,
that
was
not
the
only
reason
however,
the
union's
conduct
was
tortuous.
and
to
speak
of
the
laburnum
case
as
involving
violence
and
violence
only
is
wrong
because
it
involves
something
more.
you
will
recall
that
laburnum
was
a
contractor,
that
he
had
some
contracts
with
some
mining
companies
to
do
some
construction
work
and
that
he
had
the
promise
from
those
companies
of
further
contracts.
he
was
awarded
damages
because
the
mining
companies
terminated
his
contracts
and
because
they
reneged
on
their
promise
of
further
work.
that
was
his
damage,
the
loss
of
business
suffered
by
that
means.
now,
why
did
they
terminate
their
contracts
and
why
did
they
renege
on
their
promise?
because
they
were
threatened
that
unless
they
did
so,
you
might
have
mine
workers,
would
pull
their
own
employees
out
on
strike
and
they
would
be
shut
down.
and
the
damages
awarded
in
the
laburnum
case
were
in
fact
and
you
will
see
this
from
reading
the
court's
opinion,
the
result
of
the
threat
of
a
secondary
strike
and
consequent
yielding
by
the
mining
companies.
now,
that
language
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
and
some
of
it
was
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
this
court.
now,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
can't
distinguish
violence
from
any
other
sort
of
tortuous
conduct.
it
is
not
tortuous
per
se.
whether
or
not
it's
tortuous,
depends
upon
its
purpose
usually
upon
the
factual
context
in
which
it's
committed
just
like
any
other
context.
it
is
not
peculiar
in
that
respect.
thank
you,
your
honor.
