mr.
charles
p.
scully
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
second
occasion
upon
which
this
case
is
before
this
court
for
consideration.
however,
i
believe
that
because
of
issues
raised
in
the
brief
of
respondent,
it
might
be
desirable
to
review
very
briefly
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
determinations
of
law
in
the
various
courts
prior
to
its
appears
again
before
this
court.
now,
we
believe
that
the
testimony
discloses
that
the
union
presented
a
contract
to
the
employer
for
its
examination
and
advised
that
it
would
not
request
the
employer
to
sign
it
until
the
employees
joined
or
agreed
to
join
the
union.
and
we
believe
that's
verified
by
the
record
at
page
96,
229,
pages
231
and
232,
244,
265
and
309.
and
we
believe
that
the
reference
to
page
309
is
particularly
pertinent
because
that
is
the
testimony
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that
they
presented
the
contract
to
the
employer
for
examination
and
that
they
stated
they
would
not
request
him
to
sign
it
until
the
employees
joined
or
agreed
to
join.
and
i
think
it's
critical
because
we
believe
that
the
case
of
weber
is
applicable
here
and
there
has
been
a
determination
below
by
the
trial
court
on
other
evidence
binding
contrary
to
this
contention
by
the
union.
and
we've
accordingly
believed
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
evidence
presented,
that
it
--
in
effect
this
was
not
a
compulsion
on
the
employer
to
coerce
his
employees
but
on
the
contrary
that
the
union
contacted
the
employees
first
and
advised
the
employer
they
would
not
require
him
to
sign
until
they
agreed
to
join.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
all
right,
your
honor.
in
that
regard,
then
i
think
its
desirable,
your
honor,
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
chronological
order
of
the
case
that
--
with
respect
to
the
issue
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
the
employers
attorney
testified
that
a
--
a
petition
for
representation
was
filed
with
the
board
by
mailing
from
san
diego
to
the
los
angeles
office
on
may
7,
1953,
that
is
page
191
of
the
record.
that
on
the
same
day,
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
superior
court
of
san
diego
and
that
is
found
at
page
196
of
the
record.
that
the
complaint
gave
rise
to
injunctive
relief
and
that
thereafter,
the
regional
office
of
the
board
dismissed
the
petition
for
representation
from
which
no
appeal
of
any
kind
was
taken
and
that
the
trial
court
then
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
national
act
granted
injunctive
relief.
the
union
appealed
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
california
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
know
that
in
that
appeal,
in
reversing
the
determination
of
the
trial
court,
and
this
is
at
page
32
of
the
record.
the
district
court
of
appeal
found
that
the
picketing
was
without
violence
or
a
breach
of
peace
and
did
not
involve
any
secondary
boycott.
that
is
at
page
32
of
the
record.
the
appeal
was
then
taken
from
this
decision
of
the
district
court
reversing
the
trial
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california,
which
by
four
to
three
decision
reversed
the
district
court
and
sustained
the
trial
court
and
stated
that
although
the
board
concededly
had
primary
jurisdiction,
and
this
is
at
the
record
on
page
46,
and
i'm
now
quoting,
“there
is
no
conflict
of
jurisdiction
where
the
federal
board
determines
not
to
adjudicate
the
issue.”
and
that
is
at
page
48
of
the
record.
and
accordingly,
because
of
the
letter
from
the
regional
office
of
the
board
dismissing
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
the
amount
of
business
was
insufficient
toward
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
board,
it
admitted
that
under
the
state
law,
the
concerted
activity
was
a
proper
labor
objective.
that's
is
at
page
51
of
the
record.
but
then
held
that
the
economic
pressure
to
compel
an
employer
to
sign
the
type
of
agreement
here
involved
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
that's
at
page
52
of
the
record.
and
so
the
first
decision
of
the
state
court
of
california
was
specifically
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
that
the
conduct
was
otherwise
legal
under
the
california
law.
the
case
then
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
noted
that
the
picketing
was
peaceful,
that
the
plaintiffs
had
alleged
a
violation
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
together
with
guss
and
fairlawn
reversed
the
decision
with
respect
to
the
injunctive
relief,
reserved
its
decision
as
to
the
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
on
the
ground
that
it
was
necessary
to
reach
it
and
then
stated
that
it
did
not
reach
the
question
of
damages.
the
case
then
went
back
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
it
conceded
that
with
respect
to
the
injunctive
relief.
it
was
not
possible
for
it
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
and
accordingly,
it
reversed
as
to
that.
but
then
it
construed
the
remand
of
this
court
and
stated
that
this
court
had
invited
the
california
court,
and
this
is
the
page
332
of
the
record.
that
it
had
invited
the
california
court
to
examine
the
state
law
to
determine
whether
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
in
court
could
be
maintained
under
that
law
in
a
situation
which
this
court
referred
to
as
different
from
the
violence
in
the
laburnum,
stated
that
the
particular
case
was
distinguishable.
and
then
it's
included,
and
this
is
at
page
337
of
the
record.
and
this
is
--
quoting,
"based
on
the
foregoing
provisions
of
the
statutory
law
of
this
state
in
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
trial
court
which
is
amply
supported
by
the
evidence,
the
conduct
of
the
defendants
constituted
unlawful
labor
practices
contrary
to
and
in
violation
to
the
laws
of
the
state."
and
so
i
believe
mr.
chief
justices
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
that
summarizes
very
briefly
for
you
what
has
transpired
in
the
courts
below
insofar
as
the
litigation
in
this
case
is
concerned.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
right.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
right.
and
that's
what
i
--
that's
--
that's
what
i
had
started,
your
honor.
i
had
pointed
out
with
respect
to
the
first
item
the
testimony
that
the
union
had
presented
the
contract
to
the
employer
for
its
examination
in
a
statement
that
would
not
request
its
signature
until
after
the
employees
had
joined
or
agreed
to
join
the
union.
then
the
union
advised
the
employer
that
all
of
the
men
were
agreeable
to
becoming
members
of
the
union
and
that's
in
the
record
at
pages
103
and
at
page
237.
so
that
the
union
went
out,
spoke
to
the
employees,
they
agreed
to
become
members
and
the
union
then
advised
the
employer.
the
employer
then
stated
that
it
wished
to
speak
to
each
man
individually.
that's
at
page
103
and
page
238
of
the
record.
and
the
employer
spoke
to
them
outside
the
presence
of
any
union
representative.
that
--
that's
at
page
110
of
the
record.
the
employer
then
stated,
and
this
--
testimony
by
the
employers
at
page
240
of
the
record,
that
he
didn't
want
any
union
that
in
the
testimony
from
an
employee
witness
was
that
the
employees
drew
an
inference
that
the
employer
disapproved
of
unions,
page
133
of
the
record.
and
in
fact,
the
employer
admitted
that
everyone
knew
he
was
not
union-minded,
page
159
of
the
record,
and
that
he
left
the
employees
know
his
feeling.
that's
at
page
269
of
the
record.
the
employer
testified
also
that
he
had
never
employed
a
union
member
and
have
never
signed
a
union
contract.
that's
at
page
111
of
the
record.
the
employees
then
later
decided
to
leave
it
up
to
management
whether
they
should
join
or
not
join
the
union.
that's
at
page
120
and
129
of
the
record.
but
then
later
on,
they
changed
their
minds
about
joining
and
the
employer
advised
the
union
representative
that
the
employees
had
voted
unanimously
no
union,
page
240
of
the
record.
at
that
time,
the
union
representative
stated
that
he
believe
management
and
i'm
quoting,
“had
influenced
the
employees
in
his
absence.”
that's
page
270
of
the
record.
then
after
the
employees
had
decided
not
to
join
the
union,
there
was
a
raise
in
wages.
that's
at
page
131
of
the
record.
and
then
it
was
that
the
unions
instituted
what
we
contend
was
peaceful
picketing
with
the
sign
reading
and
i'm
quoting,
"millmen's
union
2020
teamsters
union
number
36,
invite
employees
to
join."
that's
at
page
262
of
the
record.
the
--
as
i
--
if
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that
was
the
only
sign
and
the
record
will
disclose
that
it
is
the
first
time
that
such
type
of
a
sign
had
been
used
by
the
union.
then
the
employers'
attorney
testified
with
respect
to
items
i
have
just
mentioned
that
a
petition
have
been
filed.
you'll
find
that
at
page
191
of
the
record
that
there
had
never
been
any
filing
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
that's
197
of
the
record.
that
there
has
never
been
any
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
the
representation
petition
by
the
regional
director
of
the
board.
and
as
i
say,
there
was
contrary
evidence
to
some
of
these
items
introduced
at
the
trial
court
and
then
the
trial
court
made
its
finding
that
with
respect
to
the
business
of
the
plaintiff,
it
affected
interstate
commerce
and
then
found
that
the
conduct
of
the
union
was
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
the
employer
to
coerce
his
employees
to
join
the
union
in
violation
of
the
national
act
and
issued
an
injunction
and
damages
in
the
sum
of
$1000
with
the
injunction
reading
that
it
should
remain,
and
i'm
quoting,
“unless
and
until
the
defendants
have
been
properly
designated
as
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
plaintiff's
employees
or
inappropriate
unit
thereof.”
and
that's
on
the
record
on
page
17,
and
then
it
entered
judgment
in
accordance
with
its
finding
of
law.
and
so
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
i
have
briefly
summarized
for
you
the
procedural
backgrounds
of
the
case.
i
have
attempted
to
give
to
you
the
facts
of
this
case
as
we
believe
they
could
be
viewed.
we
believe
that,
that
is
important
because
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
decision
in
garner
and
weber
and
the
decision
in
oliver
issued
by
this
court
yesterday
and
that
it
is
not
controlled
by
the
so-called
laburnum
doctrine
as
stated
by
the
respondents
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
believe
that
the
concise
question
involved
in
this
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
believe
it
can
be
summarized
to
one
and
it
may
have
subdivisions,
your
honor,
but
mr.
justice,
i
believe
the
issue
was
this.
that
where
there
is
peaceful
picketing
with
respect
to
a
labor
management
dispute,
although
which
this
court
has
found,
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction,
may
a
state
court
grant
damages
for
conduct
which
the
national
board
must
in
the
first
instance
determine
is
either
protected
or
prohibited
by
permitting
a
state
court
to
first
determine
for
itself
whether
it
is
protected
or
prohibited
and
thereby,
award
damages.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
--
i
think
your
honor
that
while
the
certain
decisions
may
be
construed,
i
--
i
believe
that
the
precise
point
has
not
been
completely
decided
in
any
decision
of
this
court.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
no,
your
honor.
the
respondents
in
their
brief
would
infer
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
reverse
laburnum.
we
believe
and
we
hope
to
demonstrate
that
laburnum
is
not
applicable
to
this
particular
case
and
that
russell
and
gonzales
and
the
other
cases
are
distinguishable
so
it
is
our
contention
that
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
reverse
itself
but
rather
to
--
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
garner
and
weber
to
this
fact
situation
and
--
and
the
oliver
doctrine
of
yesterday
of
this
court.
now,
in
that
regard
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
there
is
no
dispute
and
in
the
first
decision
in
this
case,
this
court
itself
specifically
stated
that
the
conduct
was
peaceful,
and
you
will
find
that
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
it's
on
page
50,
in
which
this
court
stated,
“the
union's
commence
peaceful
picketing
to
enforce
their
demand.”
and
that
is
found
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
its
first
opinion.
and
so
we
submit
the
--
that
also
in
the
record
both
in
the
court
below
and
in
the
testimony
that
there
is
no
dispute
but
that
the
conduct
was
peaceful,
you'll
recall
that
i
referred
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
where
not
only
indicated
that
was
peaceful
but
that
not
even
any
secondary
boycott
was
involved.
the
reason
i
stressed
that
is
because
of
an
inference
in
the
government's
brief
which
we
received
yesterday
along
the
lines
of
secondary
boycott.
then
if
we
may,
we
believe
that
the
language
in
the
garner
and
weber
cases
are
particularly
pertinent
here.
in
the
garner
case,
this
court
stated
and
i'm
quoting,
“the
power
and
duty
of
primary
decision
lies
with
the
board,
not
with
us.”
they
also
stated,
“we
conclude
that
when
federal
power
constitutionally
is
exerted
for
the
protection
of
public
or
private
interest
or
both,
it
becomes
the
supreme
law
of
--
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
cannot
be
curtailed,
circumvented,
or
extended
by
a
state
procedure
merely
because
it
will
apply
some
doctrine
of
private
rights
to
the
extent
that
the
private
rights
may
conflict
with
the
public
ones.
the
former
is
superseded.
and
that's
at
page
of
500
and
501.
then
in
the
weber
case,
this
court
stated
that
--
and
i'm
quoting,
“if
this
conduct
does
not
fall
within
the
prohibition
of
section
8
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
it
may
fall
within
the
protection
of
section
7
as
concerted
activity
for
the
purpose
of
mutual
aid
and
protection.
i
do
believe
i
may
have
misstated,
within
the
prohibition
of
section
8
and
the
protection
of
section
7.
and
there
again,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
as
i
have
outlined
from
the
court
are
particularly
pertinent
because
in
this
case,
the
union
contended
that
it
was
a
peaceful
picketing
with
respect
to
organizational
activity,
the
court
found
that
it
was
coercive
picketing
to
compel
an
employer
to
compel
his
employees
to
join
the
union.
and
so
we
believe
that
factually,
this
case
squarely
counts
within
the
statement
of
the
weber
case
namely
that
it
could
either
be
protected
activity
or
prohibited
activity
and
that
it
is
up
to
the
board
and
the
board
alone
in
the
first
instance
to
make
that
decision.
but
that
here,
a
trial
court
where
no
unfair
labor
practice
charge
had
even
been
filed
steps
in
and
intruding
itself
in
violation
of
the
doctrine
of
garner,
comes
in
and
makes
a
determination
that
it
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
act.
and
i
have
quoted
that
portion
of
the
record
already
to
this
court
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
specifically
found
that
this
was
an
8
(b)
(2)
violation,
although
what
had
never
even
been
before
the
board
and
although
no
charge
had
ever
been
filed.
with
respect
to
the
decision
of
this
court
yesterday,
we
believe
the
language
is
particularly
pertinent
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned
at
pages
49
--
48
and
49
of
the
--
of
the
page
proof.
the
court
has
stated
in
the
oliver
decision,
“congress
has
provided
for
a
system
of
federal
law
applicable
to
the
agreements
--
agreement
the
parties
made
in
response
to
that
duty
citing
lincoln
mills.
and
federal
law
sets
some
outside
limits
not
contended
to
be
exceeded
here
on
what
their
agreement
may
provide,”
citing
the
allen-bradley
and
other
cases.
and
then
continuing,
“there
is
no
room
in
this
scheme
for
the
application
here
or
this
state
policy
limiting
the
solution
that
the
parties'
agreement
can
provide
to
the
problem
of
wages
and
working
conditions.”
and
then
finally,
and
we
believe
this
is
particularly
applicable
here
because
of
the
argument
of
respondents
that
it's
the
nature
of
the
remedy
rather
than
the
substance
of
the
dispute
that
should
control.
this
court
stated
at
the
bottom
of
page
49
and
at
the
top
of
page
50,
“clearly,
it
is
immaterial
that
the
conflict
is
between
federal
law
and
the
application
of
what
the
state
characterizes
as
an
antitrust
law.
we
believe
that's
particularly
pertinent
here
because
we
submit
that
respondents
are
now
attempting
to
re-characterize
the
nature
of
the
dispute.
we
submit
that
as
we
have
quoted
the
record
to
you,
the
california
supreme
court
pursuant
to
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
this
conduct
initially
was
illegal
because
it
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(2)
even
though
it
had
never
been
before
the
board
on
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
that
the
case
is
still
founded
upon
that
determination.
that
accordingly,
under
the
principle
of
garner,
weber,
and
oliver,
if
this
court
permits
a
state
court
under
the
facts
of
this
case
to
intervene
by
awarding
damages,
it
not
only
will
permit
a
multiplicity
of
actions
to
be
asserted
in
the
labor
management
field
but
also
will
in
effect
permit
it
to
--
to
give
a
type,
in
effect
a
type
of
--
of
prevented
relief
because
a
multiplicity
of
damage
actions
can
be
as
equally
preventive
as
an
injunctive
relief.
then
if
we
may,
your
honor,
we
would
like
briefly
to
attempt
to
indicate
how
we
believe
the
cases
relied
upon
by
respondents
are
not
applicable.
first,
with
respect
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
do
not
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
all
right,
first,
if
we
may
then,
your
honor,
the
first
particular
case
is
of
course
the
laburnum
case
itself.
in
the
laburnum
case,
we
believe
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
conduct
was
violent
and
that
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
kohler
case,
the
state
court
could
have
awarded
both
injunctive
relief
and
damages
and
accordingly,
we
believe
that
that
case
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
because
this
court
in
its
first
decision
has
clearly
indicated
that
this
field
is
preemptive
insofar
as
the
garner
decision
is
concerned
and
has
reversed
as
to
injunctive
relief.
and
so,
we
believe
that
laburnum
case
is
not
applicable
here.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
remaining
two
cases,
the
first
one
is
the
russell
decision,
and
we
believe
here
that
the
russell
decision
is
even
further
removed
from
the
orbit
of
the
so-called
labor
management
field
which
is
involved
in
this
case
because
that
involved
the
prevention
of
access
to
a
plant
by
violence.
an
employee
was
prohibited
from
entering
the
plant
because
of
violence.
and
we
submit
that
absent
any
labor
dispute
at
all,
assuming
there
was
no
labor
dispute
at
all.
that
clearly,
this
would
be
conduct
which
would
be
subject
to
state
action.
and
that
accordingly,
that
conduct
is
totally
remote
from
the
conduct
to
this
case,
where
we
have
peaceful
picketing,
which
may
depend
upon
the
determination
of
the
board.be
either
protected
or
prohibited
under
the
national
act.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
gonzales
case,
we
believe
that
also
is
clearly
distinguishable
because
it
involved
purely
personal
rights
of
the
member
of
a
labor
organization
with
respect
to
his
contract
with
the
labor
organization.
and
so
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
in
accordance
with
the
doctrine
of
garner,
weber
and
oliver,
that
the
state
court
in
the
facts
present
in
this
case
is
without
authority
to
award
damages
and
we
accordingly,
respectfully
submit
that
that
portion
of
the
determination
should
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
if
the
court
please,
i
believe
that
we
should
reply
briefly
to
certain
portions
of
mr.
plant's
arguments
and
i
do
not
believe
it's
necessary
for
us
to
repeat
our
contention
with
respect
to
the
primary
determination
being
made
by
the
board
rather
than
the
state
court
where
there
is
protected
or
prohibited
activities
in
our
factual
--
in
our
reference
to
the
transcript
as
the
evidence
which
under
weber,
we
believe,
would
clearly
indicate
a
protected
rather
than
a
prohibited
activity.
we
believe
we've
adequately
covered
that.
i
do
believe
however,
we
should
point
out
that
with
respect
to
mr.
plant's
contention
that
this
court
should
consider
the
small
employer
and
that
even
though
the
field
is
preemptive
that
it
should
permit
damages,
because
otherwise
that
he
is
without
any
protection.
that
with
respect
to
that
item,
it
should
be
stressed
that
this
employer
never
even
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
the
facts
indicate
that
at
the
time
he
--
he
mailed
his
charge,
he
already
was
in
court.
correction,
at
the
time
he
filed
his
petition
for
representation,
the
same
day
he
was
in
court.
he
had
no
time
to
file
the
charge.
secondly,
that
the
argument
he
presents
has
been
disposed
of
by
this
court
in
the
initial
guss,
garmon,
and
fairlawn
cases
by
saying
that
it
is
not
even
necessary
for
congress
to
meet
this
problem
because
the
board
can
correct
the
problem
by
adjusting
its
discretion
as
to
the
scope
of
activities.
and
in
fact,
we
now
know
that
they
have
revised
in
a
substantial
way
their
rules
in
regard
to
asserting
jurisdiction
and
it
may
well
be
that
an
employer
of
this
type,
and
there
is
the
fining
as
the
$250,000
here
will
well
be
subject
to
board
jurisdiction.
and
so
we
submit
that
the
argument
overstates
itself
that
there
is
not
a
question
of
no
relief
being
available.
but
assuming
--
assuming
in
spite
of
the
action
of
the
board
and
assuming
in
spite
of
the
failure
of
the
employer
to
file
any
charge
that
there
is
this
avenue
still
open,
then
we
believe
that
this
court
has
already
answered
that
argument
in
the
first
garmon
case
with
respect
to
the
10
(a)
argument
by
saying
that
that's
a
matter
that
must
be
corrected
by
congress
and
certainly,
that
this
court
should
not
permit
the
award
of
damage
in
violation
of
the
overall
principles
of
a
uniform
national
act
solely
because
in
that
particular
refined
area,
an
employer
may
not
be
afforded
relief.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
i
think
the
first
answer
is
the
argument
which
we
have
pressed
and
which
i
believe
you
indicated
to
mr.
plant,
namely
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
--
that
it
is
not
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that
--
that
it
is
not
the
form
of
the
procedure
as
this
court
noted
in
--
in
oliver
yesterday.
it's
not
whether
you
call
it
damages
or
--
or
any
item
like
that
or
in
the
baxley
case.
it's
not
the
state
procedures
that
you
look
to.
the
question
is
what
is
the
substance?
and
the
substance
here
is
that
if
this
state
court
is
allowed
to
award
damage,
this
court
--
state
court
then
has
said,
“we
find
in
the
record
as
without
dispute
on
page
52
that
they
specifically
found
that
it
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
act.
now,
we
believe
that
is
the
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that's
the
first
decision,
yes.
and
i'm
sorry,
i
gave
you
an
erroneous
citation,
your
honor.
it's
on
page
52,
it's
correct,
on
the
middle
paragraph.
the
court
said,
"the
assertion
of
economic
pressure
to
compel
an
employer
to
sign
the
type
of
agreement
here
involved
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
act."
and
so
our
main
answer
is,
your
honor,
that
to
permit
the
state
court
to
make
that
determination
which
is
the
primary
function
and
duty
of
the
board
is
to
create
the
worst
possible
types
of
conflict
and
we
believe
as
already
then
precluded
by
the
garner
and
weber
decisions.
now
secondly
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
--
i
think
that
the
whole
reading
of
the
opinion
indicates
that
that
is
still
the
underlying
thought
of
the
court
and
that
it
is
not
privileged
conduct
because
it
is
violative
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
with
respect
to
mr.
plant's
second
main
point,
this
303
argument,
we
would
like
to
make
it
clear
first
of
all
that
in
this
case,
we
believe
303
is
a
no
way
involved.
the
district
court
of
appeal
as
we
have
noted
indicated
not
only
that
it
was
peaceful,
but
there
was
no
secondary
boycott.
secondly,
we
--
we
believe
that
mr.
plant
has
misconstrued
section
303.
in
this
regard,
it
is
to
be
pointed
out
that
this
court
in
the
juneau
spruce
decision
at
page
238
of
the
supreme
court
reporter
series
stated,
"congress
was
here
concerned
with
reshaping
labor
management
legal
relations
and
it
was
taking
precise
steps
to
declare
an
announced
objective,”
and
then
continuing,
“for
the
jurisdiction
dispute
proscribed
by
section
303
(a)
(4)
are
reserved,
--
are
--
are
made
unlawful
"for
the
purpose
of
this
section
only,
thus
setting
apart
for
private
redress
acts
which
might
also
be
subject
to
the
administrative
process,"
and
then
the
court
continued
and
this
is
at
page
239.
"these
prohibitions
limiting
and
curtailing
the
administrative
power
find
a
counterpart
in
the
provisions
for
private
redress
in
303
(a)
(4).”
and
so
we
submit
first
of
all
that
section
303
on
its
face
says
and
i'm
quoting,
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
only
and
that
the
court
in
the
juneau
spruce
case
emphasized
and
stressed
that
point.
secondly,
that
rather
than
being
weighed
against
the
position
of
petitioners
before
this
court,
it
supports
us
because
it
shows
that
where
congress
wished
to
afford
rights
to
private
parties
under
the
act,
they
knew
how
to
provide
them.
and
that
when
they
wished
to
provide
rights
to
private
parties,
they
called
out
only
these
specific
items,
put
them
in
section
303,
and
as
this
court
has
noted,
and
said,
“you
can
have
these
private
rights.”
and
we
submit
certainly
rather
than
arguing
that
all
private
rights
exist
under
the
act,
the
303
argument
will
support
our
contention
that
having
so
limited
and
specifically
stated
for
the
purpose
of
this
section
only
that
you
certainly
cannot
argue
that
303
supports
the
contentions
of
respondents.
now,
further,
with
respect
to
mr.
plant's
contention
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
deena
case
where
on
the
same
day
it
said,
"we
affirm
the
order
of
the
board
and
we
affirm
the
order
of
the
court,"
created
a
conflict.
we
believe
that
the
very
statement
in
the
juneau
spruce
indicate
that
congress
purposely
stated
we
are
going
to
proscribe
two
separate
types
of
remedies
(1)
the
board
and
(2)
we're
going
to
restrict
the
wide
broad
discretion
of
the
board
and
provide
private
remedies
and
of
necessity,
where
congress
purposely
gave
two
forums
the
same
subject
matter
upon
which
to
act,
then
inconsistency
might
result.
but
in
this
case,
congress
has
confined
to
one
forum,
the
ability
to
act.
now,
we
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
first
of
all,
your
honors,
so
that
our
position
is
clear.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
board
refused
to
take
jurisdiction.
and
as
the
footnote
to
the
original
decision
will
show,
the
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
was
reserved
in
the
first
garmon
case.
and
as
we
stated
before,
we
believe
that
question
is
still
before
the
court
at
this
time,
namely,
can
a
person
simply
file
a
petition
for
representation,
have
it
rejected
and
thereafter,
do
nothing
so
that
he
can
escape
the
state
courts
to
get
damage
actions?
but
with
respect
to
the
particular
issue
you
raised,
we
wish
to
know
that
in
this
case
as
we
stated
the
facts
to
the
court,
it
may
well
be
that
this
was
coercion
by
the
employer
against
the
employees
to
prevent
them
from
being
unionized.
and
so
we
would
have
a
state
court
awarding
damages
against
the
union
where
the
employer
had
itself
violated
a
protected
right,
which
under
certainly
a
national
act,
should
not
only
have
been
privileged
but
should
have
been
protected.
and
so
you
have
the
unique
result
that
assuming
that
the
board
would
not
take
jurisdiction
either
of
a
representation
case
or
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
from
either
side,
the
court
could
then
be
granting
relief
to
an
employer
where
in
fact
the
board
would
have
disciplined
the
employer
and
we
think
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that's
right.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
no,
your
honor.
for
this
reason,
that
if
you
agree
with
this
particular
case,
then
as
the
individuals
who
have
written
articles
on
the
subject
matter
of
damages
have
indicated,
it
would
be
permissible
for
an
employer
to
follow
the
very
tactics
involved
in
this
case
to
file
a
very
weak
petition
for
representation,
never
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge,
and
thereby
avoid
ever
having
litigated
before
the
board,
the
question
of
protected
or
--
or
prohibited
and
then
go
into
court
and
get
damages.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
but
i
understand
your
honor
is
that
where
the
courts
--
where
the
board
declines
to
accept
it.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
and
--
and
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
no.
no
problem.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
or
--
well,
if
that's
--
if
that
is
the
approach
your
honor
is
--
mr.
charles
p.
scully
--
mr.
justice
have
taken,
then
i
suggest
this,
your
honor,
that
if
the
board
for
some
sound
reasons,
some
sound
reason,
says,
"we
do
not
wish
to
take
and
occupy
this
labor
management
sphere,"
it
therefore
remains
unregulated.
and
that
when
the
state
then
comes
in,
and
by
a
damage
action,
takes
over
and
regulate
it,
the
very
conflict
of
the
board
saying,
"we
are
going
to
leave
this
to
the
free
occupancy
of
economic
contest
in
the
labor
management
field"
is
in
fact
conflicted
by
a
state
court
coming
in
and
saying,
"we
are
going
to
assess
damages
where
the
board
said
that
this
field
should
go
unregulated."
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
let's
say
that
it
is
to
be
left
unregulated
by
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
well,
but
you
could
have
an
argument.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
i
think
that's
what
the
first
garmon
case
can
be
construed
as
wholly.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
that's
correct.
the
first
case
can
so
be
construed.
mr.
charles
p.
scully
so
that
we
submit
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
303
argument,
your
honor,
because
mr.
plant
has
inferred
that
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
his
arguments,
303
also
covers
state
courts.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
argument
is
involved
in
this
case.
but
we
wish
to
point
out
that
the
legislative
history
at
page
1368
in
discussing
this
bill
clearly
indicates
that
when
they
talk
about
district
courts
or
comparable
courts
that
they
are
talking
about
federal
courts.
and
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
juneau
spruce
case
also
would
--
would
infer
that
particular
situation.
finally,
with
respect
to
mr.
plant's
construction
of
the
laburnum
decision
in
the
state
court
below,
we
wish
to
point
out
that
the
state
court
did
not
find
and
did
not
consider
any
secondary
boycott
being
involved
and
instead,
it
specifically
stated
through
justice
edelstein
that
there
was
no
redress
of
any
kind
as
to
what
--
under
that
particular
case
with
respect
to
any
violation
of
the
act.
and
so
we
do
not
believe
that
laburnum
can
be
distinguished
on
the
ground
that
a
secondary
boycott
was
involved.
