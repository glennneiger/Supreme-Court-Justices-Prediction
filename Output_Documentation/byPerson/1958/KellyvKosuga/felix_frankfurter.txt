and
--
and
then
they
don't
really
as
you
say
kept
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
physically
they
rarely
get
into
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
really
a
form
of
merchandising
insurance
to
a
large
extent
against
changes
in
price
levels.
justice
felix

this
--
this
court
once
said
before
direct
prosecution
or
rather
an
equity
suit
by
--
against
combination
in
restraint
of
trade
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
regard
to
constant
future
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
suggested
a
minute
ago
that
the
test
is
--
whether
it
furthers
an
illegal
scheme,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
the
analysis
has
to
be
a
little
sharper
as
to
what
is
meant
by
furthering.
you
may
remotely
further,
certainly
if
anybody
can
buy
from
a
--
from
a
steel
trust
or
(inaudible)
trust
in
the
old
days
on
the
culmination
of
a
decree
and
it
-
they
sell
all
their
goods
and
nobody
needs
to
pay
for
it.
it
would
certainly
hamper
the
economic
enterprise
of
those
trusts.
but
the
question
is
and
here
if
elsewhere,
how
remotely
may
you
pursue
what's
further
and
what
doesn't
further?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
a
part
of
a
price
stabilizing
but
if
the
contract
in
and
of
itself
is
not
price
fixing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
what
you
pleaded
but
a
question
of
what
the
contract
on
its
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
contract
on
its
face
has
terms
which
in
--
as
a
contract
that
particular
contract
of
purchase
includes
provisions
which
as
--
as
to
that
very
concept,
not
the
relation
of
that
contract
to
outside
activity.
the
corn
products
case
was,
of
course,
a
flagrant
case
of
a
trust,
of
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
flagrant
combination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
the
contract
may
negative
your
pleading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
got
to
--
have
not
merely
--
it
can't
be
distorted
unless
--
on
theory
of
petitioner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
--
unless
the
welching,
if
i
may
use
(inaudible)
expression,
the
welching
fire
had
knowledge
of
the
--
of
the
ingredient
of
the
specific
contracts
to
the
larger
antitrust
--
antitrust
violation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
has
to
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
interview,
the
fellow
is
out
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
discriminatory
in
a
sense
that
--
that
the
fellow
who
don't
want
to
welch
pay
and
only
the
welch
get
the
benefit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
that
extent
discrimination.
he's
a
fellow
who
says,
“i've
got
the
goods,
i'm
going
to
pay
for
it,”
and
that's
that.
(inaudible)
business.
but
it
isn't
really
the
little
fellow,
am
i
wrong
that
in
the
continental,
voight
wasn't
a
small
buyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
voight
was
a
considerable
buyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
sometimes
find,
it
depends
to
utilize
not
merely
by
small
supply.
in
fact,
they
--
they
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
confirmation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
is
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
there
agreement
or
controversy
as
to
the
term
of
the
oral
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
implied
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
your
relation
to
this
alleged
illegal
transaction?
you
were
just
a
buyer
of
--
of
--
what
were
your
--
what
were
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
suit
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suit
was
for
physical
onion,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
be
delivered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
ever
or
in
appreciable
quantity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that
would
be
(inaudible)
that
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
said
it
would
be
--
would
be
different
in
--
in
onions
in
almost
any
other
commodities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
your
real
--
the
real
controversy
in
this
case
(inaudible)
is
the
correctness
of
error
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
contract
of
purchase
was
complete
in
itself
and
contain
the
typical
considerations
in
--
in
the
party,
the
contention
of
non-delivery
is
asserted
as
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
in
part
of
the
(inaudible)
inherent
part
in
the
same
which
it
appears
sought
to
be
enforced
a
judgment
if
rendered
for
the
plaintiff
would
not
afford
judicial
aid
to
the
enforcement
of
the
allegedly
illegal
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
--
that's
why
you
come
to
grips-wood.
