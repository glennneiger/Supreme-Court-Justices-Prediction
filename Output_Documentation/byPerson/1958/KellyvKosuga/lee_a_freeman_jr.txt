mr.
lee
a.
freeman
i
think
at
the
outset,
it
is
important
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
what
certain
factual
matters
clearly
in
the
court's
mind.
counsel
--
at
first
i
thought
by
inadvertence
but
after
repeated
reference
finds
--
i
find
(inaudible)
favor
of
this
record.
one
of
the
important
points
here
is
that
a
sale
of
onions
was
made,
50
cars,
to
this
particular
defendant
and
a
condition
was
imposed
of
non-delivery
but
counsel
recites
that
condition
as
an
agreement
by
both
sides
not
to
deliver
those
onions
on
the
futures
market
or
on
the
cash
market.
he
seeks
to
create
the
impression
here
that
these
onions,
all
of
them,
were
to
be
completely
withheld
from
the
market.
actually,
if
i
were
to
be
spared
a
--
what
does
he
--
what
has
to
do
with
them?
should
the
onions
rot
or
should
we
eat
them?
but
actually
that
isn't,
that
isn't
the
issue
as
he
has
presented
it
in
his
answer.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes,
the
contract
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
the
record
of
the
contract
contains
no
reference
to
this
non-delivery
condition
but
in
his
affirmative
defense
and
in
his
answer.
and
i
read
for
any
--
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
that
the
only
condition
that
was
imposed.
and
he
says
so
on
page
11
that
the
plaintiff
and
his
associate,
and
i
read
from
the
third
paragraph,
bottom
of
it,
would
not
make
any
deliveries
on
the
futures
market
for
the
balance
of
the
trading
season.
and
so
he
goes
on
page
14
on
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
last
two
lines
that
the
plaintiff
would
not
deliver
any
onions
on
the
futures
market
for
the
balance
of
the
trading
season.
let
me
see
if
i
can
give
some
enlightenment
to
that
particular
condition.
the
futures
market
is
distinct
from
the
cash
onion
market.
this
transaction,
in
our
opinion,
was
entirely
a
transaction
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
cash
onions.
people
trade
on
the
futures
market
in
chicago
and
elsewhere
and
they
buy
and
sell
futures
contracts
which
contain
the
requirement
on
the
part
of
the
purchaser
to
accept
delivery
if
its
made
to
them
in
the
futures
market
and
on
the
part
of
the
seller
to
make
delivery
on
the
contract
month.
actually,
deliveries
are
very
rare.
the
transactions
wring
themselves
out.
and
we
had
cited
a
study
made
by
the
commodities
exchange
authority
that
over
the
last
10
years,
there
was
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
total
contracts
that
were
settled
by
delivery.
that's
the
only
condition
that
we
concede
existed
as
a
part
of
this
sale
--
purchased
and
sale
transaction.
secondly,
this
was
not
a
price
fixing
agreement
and
there
is
no
basis
upon
which
counsel
can
so
say.
the
allegations
in
his
--
in
his
affirmative
answer
--
as
--
answer
an
affirmative
defense
conflict
with
the
fact
that
a
price
fixing
agreement
was
here.
there
is
no
per
se
violation
here.
the
motion
to
strike
that
was
heard
by
the
district
court
was
heard
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
conceded
as
they
were
alleged.
and
the
district
court
held
not
only
that
this
defense
was
not
available
in
a
--
in
a
suit
on
a
contract
but
also
that
the
claim
of
illegality
was
erroneous,
that
the
condition
of
non-delivery
was
a
reasonable
restraint
imposed
by
a
purchaser
of
goods
in
order
to
protect
his
purchasers.
and
there
are
many
examples
that
we
can
cite.
you
buy
a
business
and
agreed
not
to
compete
for
five
years.
of
course,
it's
a
restraint.
but
it's
considered
a
reasonable
part
of
doing
business.
and
this
is
what
the
district
court
held.
and
mind
you,
while
i
am
now
arguing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
condition
was
illegal,
i
intended
to
say
to
this
court
that
i
would
not
argue
it
that
it
isn't
before
the
court
that
counsel
asks
you
to
assume
that
it's
illegal.
and
on
that
basis,
determine
that
the
defense
was
available.
but
the
district
court
has
already
said
that
it
was
not
illegal.
the
court
of
appeals
infers,
they
say,
“we
will
not
pass
upon
it
but
we
have
our
doubts,”
the
court
of
appeals
infers
that
it
was
not
illegal
and
counsel
has
not
briefed
or
argued
that
point
in
this
court.
let
me
make
another
correction
of
the
record.
you
were
--
one
of
the
justices
asked
counsel
whether
or
not
all
the
buyers
were
notified
and
all
of
them
repudiated.
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
it's
not
important
that
it
is
not.
actually,
many
of
the
buyers
did
fulfill
their
contract.
and
possibly,
this
is
beyond
counsel's
knowledge
because
all
of
the
people
who
repudiated
this
contract
were
counsel's
clients.
and
the
repudiation
came
on
march
9th
as
the
pleadings
established.
and
mr.
kelly's
partner
and
co-owner
of
a
business
filed
an
affidavit
in
this
proceeding
which
was
considered
by
the
district
court
in
support
of
the
motions
that
were
presented.
and
in
that
affidavit,
mr.
kelly's
partner
says
in
march
1956,
the
time
of
the
repudiation,
in
march
1956,
the
prices
for
cash
onions
stored
in
chicago
dropped
substantially
and
difficulties
were
encountered
in
the
merchandising
of
such
onions
due
to
the
arrival
in
chicago
of
fresh
texas
onions.
this
is
a
market
phenomenon.
and
if
you
will
read
counsel's
answer,
you
will
find
that
on
march
9th
when
they
repudiated
the
contract,
they,
for
the
first
time,
raised
the
question
not
only
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
but
violation
of
a
multitude
of
other
statutes
which
they
have
now
abandoned.
some
reference
was
made
by
justice
stewart
to
the
counterclaim,
and
i
think
that
justice
douglas
took
it
up,
on
the
misconception
that
the
counterclaim
was
in
effect,
damages
arising
out
of
this
illegal
condition
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
travel
damage
counterclaim,
not
so.
the
counterclaim
was
based
on
the
allegation
that
we've
reached
this
non-delivery
condition
that
the
plaintiff's
had
agreed
not
to
deliver
in
the
futures
market
during
the
futures
trading
season
and
that
we've
reached
this
agreement
and
therefore,
they
suffered
damages.
this
counterclaim
was
not
doubt
by
the
district
court
and
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
they
have
abandoned
it
here.
but
they
have
never
asked
for
damages
on
a
travel
damage
basis
or
by
reason
of
having
been
violated
of
--
injured
because
of
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
they
can't
show
any
such
damages,
and
they
haven't.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
they
claim
here
--
come
here
on
a
rather
unusual
posture.
they
come
here
not
only
proclaiming
that
they
were
guilty
but
even
gilding
a
lily.
they
have
proclaimed
that
they
were
part
of
a
price
fixing
agreement
when
it
wasn't
so.
they
claimed
that
they
were
part
of
the
withholding
of
onions
from
the
cash
market
when
it
isn't
so.
incidentally,
and
i
should
have
mentioned
this
and
emphasized
it,
this
record
shows
that
the
parties
agreed
that
they
would
merchandise
their
onions
all
of
them
purchased,
sold
or
held
in
normal
and
regulatory
channels.
chicago
market
was
to
be
--
was
to
be
used
as
well
as
other
markets
for
the
--
for
the
disposition
of
these
onions.
this
is
here
in
this
record.
the
district
court
commented
upon
it
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
no
withholding
from
the
market
as
such
of
any
commodity.
let
me
say
that
in
our
opinion,
the
court's
decision
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
with
one
correction.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
not
to
deliver
any
onions
in
the
futures
market.
he
could
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
deal
in
the
futures
market
if
he
wanted
to
on
contract
but
not
to
deliver.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
this
man
and
all
of
these
people
are
onion
growers
and
they
have
onions
in
storage
which
is
called
“country
storage”
but
it's
out
on
the
fields
in
wisconsin
and
michigan
and
new
york.
in
addition,
they
had
these
onions
in
storage
as
distinguished
if
i'm
out
in
the
field
in
storage
in
chicago.
and
it
was
only
these
storage
onions
that
were
the
subject
of
disagreement.
and
the
only
restraint,
and
the
only
restriction,
none
--
no
other
exists,
was
that
we
will
sell
you
these
onions
at
the
market
price
and
we
will
agree
that
we
will
not
deliver
the
--
the
remainder
of
our
onions
in
the
futures
market
and
you
will
agree
not
to
deliver
these
in
the
futures
market
but
--
but
merchandise
them
in
normal
trade
channels.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
cash
market
of
the
actual
earners.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes,
the
merchandising.
the
cash
market
is
the
actual.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
excuse
me?
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
that's
right.
the
things
we
eat
sometimes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
all
of
the
market
accepted
it.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no,
just
--
there
were
approximate
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
according
to
the
pleadings,
approximately
600.
we
didn't
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
own
the
600.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
we
owned
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
possibly
300
or
400.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
but
600
were
in
storage
in
chicago.
there
may
have
been,
and
i
go
outside
the
record
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
5000
--
10,000
cars
of
onions
throughout
the
country.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
in
order
to
avoid
the
--
the
attack
that
a
futures
co-transaction
is
a
gambling
transaction,
the
--
the
fable
in
most
instances
is
indulged
that
every
--
every
person
who
sells
in
the
futures
market
intends
to
make
delivery
on
the
--
at
the
contract
month
and
every
person
who
buys
and
tends
to
take
deliveries
and
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
but
on
--
in
the
future
month,
yes.
and
in
onions,
for
example,
they
trade
in
november,
december,
january,
february
and
march
contracts
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
other
--
other
commodities
in
other
monthly
contracts
but
the
transaction
is
you
buy
in
november,
for
example,
a
march
contract,
if
you
buy
it,
you
may
have
to
take
delivery
in
march
of
those
actual
onions.
a
car
is
600
bags.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
next
march.
that's
right.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
not
until
the
contract
month.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
not
until
the
contract
month.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
physically
rarely.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
that's
right.
it's
a
merchandising
insurance
and
it's
used
extensively
for
hedging
purposes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
that
means
that
they
will
not
--
that
these
individuals
will
not
sell
a
futures
contract
and
satisfy
that
futures
contract
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
by
making
delivery.
and
it
has
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
that's
right.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
if
they
sell
them
--
yes.
the
expression
that
seems
to
apply
here
is
that
they
will
sell
them
in
regular
and
normal
trade
channel
that
they
were
merchandise.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
that's
correct.
and
incidentally,
the
futures
delivery
is
always
at
the
option
of
the
seller.
the
seller
has
the
entire
month
to
determine
whether
he
wants
to
make
delivery
or
not
so
therefore,
if
he
decides
to
sell
in
the
futures
market
and
still
not
make
delivery,
he
just
buy
back
the
futures
contract
and
offsets
it.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
under
certain
circumstances,
it
might,
justice
black.
but
i
say
in
this
particular
instance
where
it's
part
of
a
business
transaction
which
involves
the
sale
of
cash
onions,
no.
and
besides,
that
issue
was
not
here.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
illegal
is
not
here.
we
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
it
is
illegal
and
then
might
be
proceed
and
--
and
tell
you
why
i
think
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
unfortunately
so.
i
told
that
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
believed
me.
they
decided
that
it
was
not
illegal.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
but
he
didn't
bring
this
issue
here.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
may
i
refer
you
to
page
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no.
page
--
page
24.
the
condition
imposed
--
25,
excuse
me.
the
condition
imposed
by
defendant
and
agreed
to
by
plaintiff
was
a
reasonable
restriction
to
assure
defendant
the
enjoyment
of
the
legitimate
fruits
of
his
contract
of
purchase
and
to
protect
it
from
a
possible
derogation
in
the
value
of
the
property
bought.
this
condition
does
not
constitute
an
illegal
restraint
of
trade
prescribed
in
the
federal
--
illinois
antitrust
acts
which
were
then
been
involved
and
they
cite
two
or
three
cases.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no.
he
was
talking
about
the
federal
law.
the
court
of
appeal's
decision,
justice
douglas,
said
that
they
won't
pass
upon
whether
or
not
it's
illegal.
although
they
doubt
of
it
but
they
did
go
--
but
the
court
did
go
on
to
pass
upon
the
fact
that
it
did
not
violate
the
illinois
law
which
they
thought
was
involved.
and
he
has
abandoned
that
particular
point.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
if
there
was
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
i
understand.
it
--
it
could
be
under
certain
circumstances.
there
could
be
a
violation
merely
on
the
basis
of
what
was
done
in
the
futures
market
but
this
is
not
that
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
--
i
mean
counsel
--
excuse
me,
had
alleged
that
this
was
also
a
violation
of
the
commodities
exchange
act
which
deals
with
the
futures
market
but
he
is
abandoned.
but
surely,
people
can
reach
agreements
to
manipulate
futures
market
as
well
as
the
cash
market.
but
in
this
instance,
we
have
a
business
transaction,
a
sale
of
cash
onions
and
coupled
with
it
a
condition
that
we
will
not
deliver
in
the
futures
market
and
there
is
a
reason,
and
i
must
frankly
say
that
when
there
is
a
substantial
delivery
in
the
futures
market,
it
might
have
temporarily
--
it
might
temporarily
disrupt
prices
and
so
the
sellers
were
seeking
to
protect
against
the
disruption
of
such
prices
during
their
normal
merchandise.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
it
was
an
attempt
to
provide
a
base
while
they
were
--
while
they
were
selling.
in
other
words,
if
someone
came
along
with
--
with
a
great
volume
of
onions
and
delivered
it
into
the
futures
market,
you
might
disrupt
the
entire
market
and
disrupt
the
entire
onion
market
cash
as
well
as
futures.
and
so
they
avoided
that
particular
possibility.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no,
i
--
i
don't
say
limited.
i
don't
say
limited.
but
assuming
that
this
is
illegal
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
and
it
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
(voice
overlap)
versus
united
states.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
that's
right,
many,
many
years
ago.
assuming
that
this
condition
is
illegal
and
we
respectfully
submitted
to
the
court
in
our
first
point
the
--
the
fact
that
possibly,
this
case
isn't
properly
here
because
there
is
an
abstract
and
hypothetical
question
involved.
but
assuming
that
it
is
illegal,
we
contend
that
the
--
this
type
of
defense
is
not
available
in
a
contract
action.
and
we
say
first,
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
that
here,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
attempt
that
is
being
made
by
the
petitioners
is
an
attempt
at
unjust
enrichment.
they
got
the
goods
and
they
don't
want
to
pay
for
it
to
the
extent
of
$37,000.
there
is
no
case,
no
case
that
this
court
has
decided
where
unjust
enrichment
resulted
from
either
the
grant
or
a
denial
of
an
antitrust
violation
in
the
contract
action
where
the
court
has
denied
the
defense
in
connelly,
wilder,
small
versus
lamborn
and
bruce's
juices,
of
course,
there
was
no
unjust
enrichment
to
the
defendant.
where
the
court
has
granted
the
defense
such
as
they
did
in
continental
wall
paper,
still
no
unjust
enrichment
because
the
court
itself
points
out
that
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
were
and
weren't
--
and
they
were
admitted
that
the
amount
sued
for,
the
amount
sued
for
exceeded
the
value
--
exceeded
--
well,
it's
the
--
that
the
amount
for
which
suit
was
bought
was
greatly
an
excess
of
the
excess
in
value
over
market
value.
i
haven't
made
that
clear.
but
in
connelly,
the
amount
involved
in
that
suit
was
excessive
over
the
fair
market
value.
and
so
in
--
in
--
i
mean
in
continental,
so
that
by
granting
the
defense
and
denying
a
remedy,
there
was
still
no
unjust
enrichment
because
the
defendant
had
already
paid
more
than
the
fair
value
of
the
goods
that
he
had
bought
in
for.
in
this
instance,
it
is
admitted
that
the
price
was
the
fair
market
price.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
let
me
just
read
it
because
i
didn't
state
it
well.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
then
it
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
fair
market
value
and
in
this
instance,
it
was
a
fair
market
value.
there
was
no
--
there's
no
claim
of
price
effect
prior
to
the
december
17,
1955
date
when
this
agreement
was
entered
into.
but
the
statement
that
the
court
makes
in
continental,
which
i
think
the
court
said
a
lot
better
than
i
did,
and
it's
--
it's
put
in
italics
by
mr.
justice
hollander.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
oh,
this
is
1912.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
it's
1912,
i
believe,
and
it's
the
only
case
--
1909,
and
it's
the
only
case
that
counsel
can
rely
upon.
he
says
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
on
page
250
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
253.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
price
is
fixed
by
such
combination
--
combination
and
the
price
is
therein
sought
to
be
recovered
for
said
merchandise
are
unreasonable,
excessive
and
above
the
fair
market
price
of
such
merchandise
by
more
than
the
amounts
so
sought
to
be
recovered.
let
me
proceed
on
with
my
statement
that
in
no
instance
was
unjust
enrichment
granted.
in
the
bruce's
juices
cases,
this
court
was
divided
5-to-4.
the
majority
held
that
the
defense
of
antitrust
violation,
robinson-patman
in
that
instance,
was
not
available.
the
statute
didn't
provide
for
it.
there
were
reasons
of
equity
and
policy
for
not
permitting
it.
and
so,
there
was
no
unjust
enrichment.
the
minority,
however,
a
minority
of
four
agreed
that
if
the
defense
of
illegality
were
to
be
permitted,
still,
the
plaintiff
should
be
entitled
to
a
recover
on
a
quantum
meruit
or
quantum
valebant
for
the
value
of
the
goods
that
was
sold.
and
so
we
find
in
bruce's
juices,
which
is
the
latest
case
that
this
court
has
decided
in
this
field,
that
all
nine
justices
agreed
that
there
should
be
no
unjust
enrichment
and
that
the
plaintiff
should
recover
the
fair
value
of
his
goods.
and
here,
it
is
conceded
that
the
price
at
which
we
sold
these
onions
was
the
fair
value
of
those
onions
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
we
suggest
that
this
doctrine
of
distinguishing
the
cases
on
the
ground
that
in
--
that
an
innocent
participant
or
a
guilty
--
an
innocent
stranger
or
a
guilty
participant
is
involved
is
not
a
valid
distinction.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
--
it
sounds
peculiar.
how
can
you
say
that
if
a
man
is
a
guilty
participant
and
certainly
mr.
louisell
has
tried
to
bring
himself
in
as
strongly
as
possible,
he
should
be
relieved
from
paying
the
balance,
but
if
he
was
an
innocent
stranger,
oh,
then
we've
got
to
make
him
pay.
this
is
--
apparently
some
courts
have
indicated
that
this
is
the
distinction
between
connelly
versus
continental,
and
it
doesn't
sit
right.
neither
can
we
say
that
--
saying
that
a
contract
is
inherently
invalid
or
has
a
collateral
invalidity
answers
anything.
it's
still
a
label.
and
if
you'll
look
at
all
of
the
cases
that
the
court
has
decided
in
this
field,
i
think
you
are
impressed
with
the
fact
that
the
true
standard
and
the
one
that
we
ask
that
this
court
announced
in
this
instance
is
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
will
aid
or
further
the
illegal
purpose,
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
will
assist
the
plaintiff
in
accomplishing
an
unlawful
end,
then
the
defense
should
be
made
available,
then
the
remedy
should
be
denied.
in
this
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
excuse
me.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
excuse
me
for
not
having
mentioned
that
--
that
the
majority
in
bruce's
juices
felt
that
quantum
meruit
was
not
to
be
had,
the
minority
did.
but
the
majority
agreed
that
the
defense
of
illegality
did
not
lie
and
therefore,
the
remedy
was
permitted
for
the
full
amount
of
the
contract.
and
mind
you,
in
bruce's
juices,
the
claim
was
made
that
the
amount
sued
for,
represented
the
discriminatory
component.
in
other
words,
represented
the
excess
over
what
was
reasonable
for
these
cans,
represented
an
amount
that
was
excessive
and
therefore
to
the
extent
to
which
the
court
granted
a
judgment
there
or
permitted
the
remedy,
it
really
furthered
the
conspiracy
or
the
illegality
to
that
extent.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
according
to
the
majority
footnote,
according
to
the
majority
footnote,
yes.
but
of
course,
we
accept
the
majority
ruling
in
bruce's
juices
because
the
result
of
it
is
that
the
defense
is
not
made
available.
that
we
--
we
may
have
our
remedy
on
the
contract
and
the
claim
of
illegality
under
the
antitrust
act
does
not
lie.
and
this
court
has
reiterated
that
in
recent
--
in
--
in
last
year
that
the
sanctions
provided
under
the
antitrust
laws
are
exclusive,
and
if
congress
wanted
to
add
to
the
sanctions,
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
claim
illegality
in
a
contract
action,
congress
could
do
so.
congress
had
that
opportunity
over
the
years,
bills
were
introduced
and
we
set
forth
some
of
this
legislative
history
indicating
that
congress
did
not
conceive
that
it
was
appropriate
to
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
on
a
simple
contract
or
debt
action,
the
defendant
should
be
permitted
to
complicate
the
action
or
to
raise
the
problem
of
an
antitrust
violation.
if
he
has
an
antitrust
violation,
let
him
bring
an
action
and
show
his
damages.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes,
the
court
did
so
say,
and
we
respectfully
would
take
issue
of
that.
we
do
have
--
mind
you,
the
court
has
unanimously
held
in
the
wilder
case
which
was
decided
in
--
in
the
1920s.
in
the
wilder
case,
the
court
held
that
in
a
sherman
act
case,
the
defense
was
not
available.
that
--
the
sanctions
provided
by
congress
and
at
that
time
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
well,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
wilder
case
involved
a
glucose
monopoly
where
a
contract
was
entered
into
in
which
the
purchase
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
i
think
the
opinion
is
ambiguous
in
that
respect.
i
--
i
believe
--
i
mean,
at
least
it's
my
interpretation
of
that
opinion
that
the
two
conditions
that
were
included
in
that
contract
of
purchase
of
glucose
which
the
court
commented
on,
one
was
that
the
purchaser
must
exclusively
buy
all
of
his
glucose
from
these
people
in
order
to
receive
a
rebate
and
the
other
that
he
--
that
he
could
not
resell
such
commodities,
such
glucose.
i
--
i
believe
that
the
court
was
in
effect
saying
that
these
two
conditions
would
not
suffer
a
defeat
of
the
remedy
rather
than
to
hold
that
it
was
not
an
illegality.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
i
would
agree
and
i
would
add
some
--
limiting
--
limiting
the
adjectives
or
adverbs
or
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
well,
this
was
not
a
price
--
it
was
a
price
stabilizing
device
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
condition
imposed
to
assist
the
sellers
and
the
purchasers
in
--
in
disposing
of
their
commodities
in
normal
trade
channels.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
it
wasn't
in
and
of
itself
price
fixing.
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
example
would
be
that
if
we
sought,
by
action,
to
enforce
the
non-delivery
condition
and
we
have
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
it
is
illegal
and
is
price
fixing
and
so
on
that
if
we
had
a
--
if
we
sought
by
action
to
enforce
the
non-delivery
condition,
then
a
judgment
of
the
court
enforcing
that
non-delivery
condition
would
be
directly
aiding
the
illegal
purpose.
but
here,
we
aren't.
here,
our
one
guide
in
determining
whether
or
not
we
are
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
legal
right
with
an
illegal
practice
is
--
is
our
pleadings.
maybe
it's
not
an
exact
guide
but
we
have
made
a
simple
--
we
--
we
presented
a
simple
complaint
for
goods
and
services
rendered,
for
prices
that
are
agreed
upon.
there's
no
problem
about
all
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
that
purchase
and
sale.
and
as
they
said
in
--
in
wilder,
the
--
the
sale
of
the
goods
was
matched
by
consideration
to
pay
for
the
goods.
these
outside
conditions
were
supplementary
to
it.
there
was
also
the
--
the
condition
that
both
sides
said
they
would
not
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
contract
and
on
its
face
also
has
no
illegal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
it
seemed
to
me.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
well,
even
on
the
contracts
or
the
pleadings,
this
court
has,
from
time
to
time,
mentioned
the
fact
that
a
look
at
the
pleadings
was
--
a
significant
value
but
we're
willing
to
concede
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
or
look
at
the
contract.
i'm
willing
to
concede
this
much
that
even
though
our
complaint
is
not
referred
to
the
illegal
factors
as
the
defense
properly
raises
these
--
these
illegal
factors
and
the
court's
judgment
would
necessarily
and
directly
advance
the
purpose,
the
defense
is
available.
i
would
also
say,
and
possibly
i
shouldn't
go
this
far,
but
i
would
also
say
if
the
written
instrument
does
not
contain
the
illegal
agreement
but
there
was
some
oral
understanding
that
could
be
properly
established,
then
that
too
might
be
available
but
we
don't
have
that
yet.
we
say
that
only
--
i
would
like
to
make
some
reference
to
the
patent
cases
and
i
mean,
i'm
--
i'm
rather
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
counsel
has
cited
three
or
four
cases
that
he
regards
as
principal
in
his
advocacy
that
are
not
cited
in
the
brief
and
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
reason
but
actually
there,
the
old
cases
of
beeman
and
mcmullen.
but
he
also
cites
the
sola
electric
case
which
is
a
patent
case
and
this
i
would
like
to
comment
upon
and
not
only
in
connection
with
the
sola
case
but
with
the
court's
permission
with
the
keplinger
case
which
followed
that
in
which
i
think
is
an
even
stronger
authority
for
him
if
we
were
to
cite
it.
in
these
patent
cases,
these
patent
cases,
we
contend,
have
no
relevancy
here.
they're
not
in
the
briefs,
and
they
shouldn't
be
in
the
briefs,
and
they
should
not
been
mentioned
in
the
argument.
the
patent
cases
--
the
patent
cases
involved
the
field
of
estoppel
of
patentees.
actually,
the
question
was
the
validity
of
the
patent
and
by
raising
the
validity
of
the
patent,
you
actually
were
--
were
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
failure
of
consideration.
the
illegality
of
the
price
fixing
agreement
which
might
have
accompanied
the
patent
agreement
was
a
secondary
consideration
by
this
court.
furthermore,
in
all
of
those
patent
cases,
there
is
no
unjust
enrichment.
and
we
contend
strongly
that
this
court
should
give
voice
to
an
important
public
policy
of
fairness
and
honesty
in
dealings
that
defendants
shouldn't
have
the
opportunity
of
welching
and
receiving
unjust
enrichment.
in
the
patent
cases,
we
contend
that
there
could
be
no
unjust
enrichment
because
the
royalties
that
were
denied
in
the
kiplinger
case,
not
in
the
sola,
but
the
royalties
that
were
denied
in
the
kiplinger
case
were
denied
because
the
patent
was
invalid.
there
was
no
consideration
for
which
to
pay
royalties.
there
was
an
absence
of
privilege
that
was
being
realized
by
the
licensing
agreement.
also,
i
might
add
that
in
the
patent
cases,
it
was
recognized
by
this
court
that
there
was
great
difficulty
in
securing
determination
of
the
validity
of
patents.
and
we
were
dealing
here
in
--
in
an
area
where
the
public
policy
surrounding
the
restraints
of
trade
that
the
antitrust
act
sought
to
eliminate
had
to
be
given
voice
to
and
--
and
as
justice
black
said
in
--
in
the
kiplinger
case,
“we
are
seeking
by
allowing
this
estoppel
to
be
brushed
aside
when
an
antitrust
violation
is
urged
upon
us.
we
are
seeking
to
free
our
economy
from
the
destructive
restraints
that
are
sometimes
practiced
by
narrow
and
invalid
patents.”
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
contract
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
contract
was
made
december
17th
1955.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
they
were
in
chicago.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
they
were
grown
and
shipped
into
chicago.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
they're
grown
in
august.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
they
were
in
storage,
mostly
storage.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes,
some
in
cars.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no,
the
contract
was
made
to
take
them
at
any
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
--
we
sent
a
telegram
which
is
an
exhibit
in
our
complaint.
we
sent
a
telegram
to
mr.
kelly
on
february
16th
and
said,
“you
haven't
taken
enough
of
your
onions
out
of
storage
and
we
think
you
ought
to
because
they're
deteriorating.”
on
february
20th,
he
wrote
back
and
says,
“sure,
we
have
an
agreement
but
i
don't
have
to
take
them
out
at
any
time.”
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
we
--
an
installment
contract,
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
$300
down,
$200
on
january
10th
and
the
balance
when
they
took
it
out
of
storage.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
on
february
16th,
we
said
that
the
onions
are
deteriorating
and
it
is
admitted
that
onions
do
deteriorate
if
we
need
that
admission.
“that
the
onions
were
deteriorating
and
it
is
important
for
you
take
them
out
of
storage.”
on
february
20th,
they
said,
“no,
we
will
not
take
them
out
of
storage.”
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
they
had
gone
down
progressively
since
december
17th.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
oh,
i
don't
know
but
onions
went
down
possibly
as
much
as
50
cents
by
then,
a
bag.
and
of
course,
then
we
do
have
this
affidavit
that
in
march
1956,
which
is
shortly
thereafter,
this
exchange
of
communication
between
mr.
kelly
and
mr.
kosuga
in
which
the
agreement
is
acknowledged,
in
march
1956,
the
onion
market
collapsed
very
substantially
because
texas
onions
were
being
brought
in
and
they
were
a
fresh
crop
and
they
were
an
excessive
crop
and
they
had
difficulties
merchandising.
so
on
march
9th,
mr.
louisell
sent
a
letter
to
my
client
in
which
he
said,
“i
represent
these
people
and
we're
repudiating
our
contract
because
it's
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.”
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
oh,
may
i
--
may
i
say
one
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
other
thing
which
i
think
possibly
bears.
the
only
excuse
that
can
be
or
the
only
reason
that
can
be
stated
for
allowing
this
type
of
a
defense
to
be
raised
in
a
contract
action
is
that
it
would
give
effectiveness
to
the
antitrust
laws.
we
respectfully
feel
that
it
would
not,
that
all
it
would
do
would
be
to
discourage
credit.
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
and
discriminatory
type
of
relief
because
the
--
the
penalty
imposed
here
would
be
completely
out
of
line
with
--
with
the
--
whatever
offense
was
involved.
and
for
several
of
the
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
bruce's
juices
in
which
we
seek
to
analyze
in
our
complaint,
we
feel,
in
our
brief,
we
feel
that
no
advantage
could
be
realized
as
far
as
effectuating
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
not
deter
violations.
indeed,
the
buyers
on
credit
would
encourage
transactions
which
might
shade
legality
in
order
to
lay
or
to
be
able
to
repudiate.
there
is
no
sure
way
of
knowing
where
you
don't
have
a
per
se
violation,
whether
you're
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
the
facts
prove
themselves,
they
didn't
even
know
about
it
until
march
1956
that
there
might
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
then
i
think
they
only
knew
because
the
price
failed
them.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
well,
number
one,
i
can't
agree
that
the
purpose
was
to
fix
prices.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
you
would
--
you
would
ask
mr.
louisell
about
the
pleadings
and
i
--
i
would
have
something
to
say
about
that.
actually,
the
pleadings
can't
be
read
as
he
does.
you
can
either
read
that
expression
he
avowed
the
expressed
purpose
as
meaning
that
there
was
an
agreement
to
fix
--
to
a
non-delivery
agreement
which
had
a
purpose.
now,
that
would
be
a
conclusion.
all
you
can
read
it
to
mean
that
there
was
an
agreement
and
they
also
agreed
that
they
would
fix
prices.
but
if
that
was
the
case,
he
could
have
pleaded
a
lot
better.
it
was
a
conclusion
in
the
court
so
held.
but
assuming
that
this
was
a
price
fixing
agreement,
you
do
not
effectuate
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
by
denying
remedies
which
are
discriminatory
and
irrational.
you
effectuate
it
by
--
congress
has
by
broadening
the
enforcement
machinery,
the
troubled
damage
action
which
is
--
which
was
made
available,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
subsequent
to
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
subsequent
to
the
wilder
case.
private
trouble
damage
actions
were
made
available.
this
then
has
a
relationship
--
i
mean,
the
troubled
damage
actions
has
a
relationship
to
the
injury,
it
has
a
reason.
it
doesn't
merely
discourage
credit
but
it
discourages
the
transaction.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
if
the
court
were
being
called
upon
to
directly
enforce
an
agreement
which
had
--
which
furthered
in
a
legal
purpose,
i
would
agree.
but
all
the
court
is
being
asked
here
is
to
affirm
a
judgment
for
goods
delivered.
we
--
this
judgment
would
have
no
relationship.
it
does
not
do
anything
toward
furthering
the
--
the
non-delivery
condition.
in
the
bruce's
juices
case,
for
example,
the
court
permitted
a
judgment
to
stand
which
it
was
conceded,
contained
a
discriminatory
amount,
an
excessive
amount
over
and
above
a
fair
value.
so
that
to
that
extent,
there
was
a
furthering
of
the
illegal
purposes
but
it
was
considered
too
remote.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
right.
i
think
the
--
the
--
before
this
defense
is
permitted,
and
this
is
a
shocking
thing
in
--
in
commercial
channels,
i
mean,
this
could
be
very
disruptive
of
business
because
every
business
transaction,
it
would
seem
to
me,
has
some
terms
and
conditions
which
might
be
distorted
and
later
resurrected
to
say,
“oh,
this
is
a
restraint
of
trade.”
you've
got
to
have
something
more
positive,
more
definite,
more
direct
than
you
have
here.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
that's
right.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
he
has
to
be
a
very
guilty
participant
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
before
the
court
will
protect
him.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
he
is
out.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
penalty
has
no
relationship
to
the
damage
that's
incurred.
the
--
the
small
buyer,
the
small
buyer
who
needs
credit
in
order
to
live
will
be
discriminated
against.
he
will
not
be
able
to
realize
this
credit
if
this
is
true
because
if
there
is
somebody
--
some
seller
who
wants
to
perpetrate
a
restraint,
some
--
some
form
of
business
that
restrictive,
he
will
do
it
on
a
cash
basis.
so
it
discriminates
to
that
extent.
it
discriminates
from
the
standpoint
of
not
making
credit
available
to
those
who
really
need
it
and
it
discriminates
because
the
penalty
itself
is
far
out
of
reason
in
some
instances
and
could
be
nothing.
if
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
if
--
some
of
these
purchases,
you
see,
have
paid
the
full
amount
of
what
they
owe.
they
didn't
repudiate,
they
just
paid.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
oh,
no.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
voight
was
a
big
man
and
bruce's
juices
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
--
was
pretty
good
sized
operation.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
you
allow
the
defense,
you
--
you
inhibit
credit
rather
than
inhibit
antitrust
violation.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
onion
--
the
cash
onions?
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
the
--
the
onions,
all
of
these
50
cars
of
onions
became
the
property
--
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
they
weren't
delivered
physically.
you're
right,
your
honor.
but
they
became
the
property
and
title
passed
to
them
on
december
17th
when
the
agreement
was
made
under
our
state
statute.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
it
--
it
includes
both.
they
were
required
to
pay
$300
or
$15,000
cash.
they
were
required
to
pay
another
$10,000
by
january
10th
which
is
$25,000.
they
paid
a
total
of
$12,500.
now,
in
addition,
out
of
the
50
cars
of
onions,
they
themselves
withdrew
and
sold
13
cars.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
possibly
$12,000.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no,
they
didn't,
your
honor.
they
didn't
--
they
withdrew
the
13
cars
of
onions
sometime
in
the
future.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
well,
if
you'll
look
at
our
brief,
we
try
to
make
that
mathematical
calculation
on
page
23,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
23.
because
in
addition
to
the
price
of
the
onions,
there
was
approximately
$5000
of
storage
charge
--
storage
charges
involved.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no,
it
has
not
been
tested
and
we
would
--
we
would
say
that
for
this
court
to
remand
for
the
purpose
of
that
test
would
be
unreasonable
and
unfair
because
counsel
did
have
adequate
opportunity
to
brief
that
point
if
he
sought
to,
he
did
not
and
he
hasn't
even
filed
a
reply
brief
after
we
raised
the
point
specifically
in
our
brief.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
yes.
mr.
lee
a.
freeman
no,
the
warehouse
receipts
were
held
until
the
last
payment
was
made.
but
our
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
type
of
passes
at
the
time
of
the
transaction
even
though
the
warehouse
receipts
are
later
delivered
and
we
do
cite
some
authority
to
that
effect.
thank
you.
