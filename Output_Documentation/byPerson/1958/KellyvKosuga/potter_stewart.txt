mr.
louisell,
in
addition
to
the
affirmative
defense,
there
was
a
--
took
hold,
there
was
a
counterclaim,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
us
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
your
--
you
allege
in
these
briefs
then,
do
you,
that
you
were
a
voluntary
coconspirator?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
on
that
--
on
the
subject
of
what
the
chief
justice
just
asked
you,
you
rely,
as
quite
properly,
upon
the
proposition
that
for
present
purposes,
these
affirmative
--
the
allegations
of
these
affirmative
defenses
must
be
taken
as
true.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
opponent
points
out
that
good
many
of
these
allegations
upon
which
you
rely
are
--
are
conclusory
that
they're
not
factual
and
that
to
that
extent
that
they
need
not
be
taken
nor
should
not
be
taken
as

discriminations
in
favor
of
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
against.
justice
potter
stewart
it
also
--
it
also,
as
you
explained
it,
had
a
--
had
this
difference
which
cuts
against
you,
didn't
it,
that
there,
the
defendant
was
a
victim
of
the
illegality
as
contrasted
with
this
case
where
the
defendant
allegedly
is
a
participant
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
willing
and
voluntary
participant
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
illegality.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
--
the
contracts
in
the
record
here
somewhere,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
--
where
is
this?
justice
potter
stewart
a
way
that's
--
their
theory
here
is
that
they
were
coconspirators,
the
conspiracy
was
to
injure
the
buying
public.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wondered
if
you
could
--
excuse
me.
(inaudible)
i
am
asking
this
question
out
of
simple
ignorance.
my
conception
of
the
futures
market
is
--
is
not
in
dealing
with
a
--
that
--
that
market
doesn't
deal
with
commodities.
it
deals
with
commodities
at
a
future
time
on
what's
actually
passed
back
and
forth.
there
are
pieces
of
paper
promises
to
deliver
wheat
next
may,
and
how
can
you
--
in
that
kind
of
a
market,
how
do
you
--
how
does
the
commodity
itself
get
delivered
now?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
future.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
next
--
but
next
march?
justice
potter
stewart
onions
never
get
into
the
picture
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
now.
not
until
the
contract
month.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
up
until
now,
you've
been
spending
really
your
time
in
telling
us
that
it's
not
illegal.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
freeman,
if
as
alleged
in
the
affirmative
defense,
the
purpose
of
this
very
agreement
was
to
fix
prices,
why
would
it
not
encourage
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
acts
by
enforcing
this
very
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
i
may
interrupt
a
minute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
course
the
troubled
damage
action
is
available
to
somebody
who's
been
victimized
by
an
antitrust
violation,
somebody
who
has
been
damaged
by
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
here,
the
theory
is
quite
different.
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
here
are
coconspirators,
conspiring
together
to
damage
the
public
by
fixing
prices.
now,
why
would
not
a
court
called
upon
to
enforce
that
very
agreement
be
encouraging
a
violation,
directly
encouraging
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
differ
from
mr.
freeman,
mr.
louisell,
in
--
in
his
statement
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
onions
became
your
property
at
the
--
in
december
at
the
time
of
the
sale?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
--
i
thought
i
had
--
probably
i'm
not
so
sure
now,
as
to
your
theory
of
--
of
what
this
contract
was,
it
--
it
was
to
withhold
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
these
onions
from
delivery
on
the
futures
market,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
the
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
or
in
depth
of
trade
that
they
would
never
deliver
