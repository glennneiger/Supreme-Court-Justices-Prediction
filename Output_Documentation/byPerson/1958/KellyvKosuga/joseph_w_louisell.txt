mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
--
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
issues
to
review
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
action
started
as
a
simple
suit
to
recover
the
purchase
price
for
the
quantity
of
onions
claimed
to
have
been
sold
by
the
respondent
in
these
proceedings
here
--
to
the
petitioner
in
these
proceedings
here.
it
was
a
brief
complaint
in
which
it
was
simply
alleged
that
there
was
a
sale
of
a
quantity
of
onions
by
kosuga
to
kelly
for
a
stipulated
price.
the
complaint
alleged
that
in
breach
of
the
contract,
kelly
had
refused
to
accept
delivery
of
a
portion
of
this
quantity
of
onions
and
that
there
remained
due
and
owing
to
kosuga
a
substantial
sum
of
money
on
account
of
that
--
that
transaction.
the
answer
filed
by
the
defendant
below,
mr.
kelly,
denied
that
this
was
a
simple
transaction
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
in
his
complaint.
the
defendant
alleged
in
--
as
an
affirmative
allegation
in
his
answer
and
further
as
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
cause
of
acton
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
was
but
an
integral
part
of
a
much
broader
understanding
and
agreement
between
the
parties.
the
defendant
alleged
that
the
crew
undertaking
between
the
parties
encompass
an
agreement
whereby
mr.
kosuga,
together
with
his
associate,
a
mr.
siegel
and
along
with
kelly
and
a
group
of
persons
similarly
situated
with
kelly,
entered
into
an
agreement,
a
combination
and
a
conspiracy
to
affect,
regulate,
modify
and
influence,
manipulate
the
price
of
onions
on
both
the
cash
and
the
futures
markets.
and
the
defendant
below,
mr.
kelly,
further
alleged
in
his
affirmative
defense
to
the
action,
that
the
incidental
purchase
by
him
of
50
carloads
of
onions
from
kosuga
was
but
an
integral
part
of
an
overall
agreement
by
which
those
similarly
situated
with
kelly
were
to
purchase
altogether
the
sum
of
287
carloads
of
onions
for
the
avowed
and
express
purpose
of
removing
not
only
that
quantity
of
onions
but
a
still
larger
quantity
of
onions
owned
by
kosuga
and
his
associate
from
the
market
in
chicago.
and
that
it
was
by
this
device
that
it
was
contemplated
that
they
would
effect
a
manipulation
of
the
market
price
of
onions.
kelly
specifically
further
alleged
that
in
consideration
of
the
entire
understanding
between
all
of
these
parties,
none
of
them,
whether
the
buyers
or
the
sellers
would
deliver
any
portion
of
the
onions
concerning
which
the
entire
contract
related
on
either
the
cash
or
the
futures
market.
now,
upon
filing
that
affirmative
defense,
the
plaintiff
below
moved
to
strike
it
from
the
grounds
that
it
did
not
constitute
an
answer
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
and
this,
notwithstanding,
it
was
spelled
out
in
the
answer
that
it
was
the
claim
of
the
defendant
kelly
below
that
in
consequence
of
this
entire
undertaking,
the
entire
agreement
as
to
a
port
of
--
a
portion
of
which,
the
plaintiff
would
rely
in
bringing
this
suit
was
illegal
as
being
contrary
to
the
sherman
antitrust
act
in
that
it
was
patently
but
a
device
by
which
to
fix
prices.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
as
alleged.
and
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
the
plaintiff
below
sued
to
recover
the
balance
of
the
purchase
price
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
--
of
the
quantity
of
onions.
the
petitioner
here
has
refused
to
pay
the
balance
of
the
purchase
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
--
price
now
setting
forth
and
as
he
set
forth
in
his
answer
below,
that
the
entire
understanding
and
the
entire
agreement
between
him
and
the
plaintiff
was
an
illegal
agreement.
that
it
was
an
agreement
contrary
to
public
policy.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
in
this
posture
of
the
case,
no,
your
honor.
now,
the
district
court
held
on
that
motion
to
strike
the
affirmative
defense
that
the
remedies
supported
by
the
sherman
act
were
its
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
kelly
had
paid
down
something
like
$15,000.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
and
he
had
ordered
his
portion
of
the
287
carload
order,
it
was
50
carloads.
and
the
product
of
the
mollification
of
the
number
of
the
cars
by
the
stipulated
price
was
something
like
$50,000
or
close
to
$50,000
so
that
ultimately,
the
plaintiff's
security
judgment
in
the
sum
of
$37,000
or
approximately
$37,000
as
representing
the
balance
of
the
sum
claimed
to
be
due
and
owing
under
the
contract.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
the
onions
were
disposed
of
ultimately
by
the
--
the
plaintiff
below,
the
respondent
here,
after
he
had
notified
kelly
as
he
had
notified
all
of
the
others
who
entered
into
this
arrangement
with
him
that
he
was
going
to
dispose
of
the
onions
because
they
were
deteriorating.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
they
were
deteriorating
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
--
and
hadn't
been
picked
up
by
either
kelly
or
by
all
of
these
others
who
entered
into
simultaneously
the
same
arrangement
and
undertaking
with
mr.
siegel
and
mr.
kosuga.
and
the
amount
that
was
ultimately
arrived
at
in
entering
the
judgment
represented
the
balance
owing
less
what
was
salvaged
by
kosuga
on
a
--
a
sale
of
those
that
remained
in
--
remained
on
hand.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
none,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
it
was
at
a
market
price,
at
the
then
existing
market
price
at
the
time
of
the
contract
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
--
of
the
undertaking.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
they
did,
your
honor.
and
this
is
the
only
suit
that
has
thus
far
been
commenced
against
any
of
those
similarly
situated
as
was
kelly.
now,
the
district
court
held
that
the
remedy
afforded
by
this
--
the
remedies
afforded
by
the
sherman
act
were
exclusive
of
non-collectability
of
the
purchase
price
of
the
contract
and
predicated
it's
decisions
upon
that
ground.
the
district
court
seemingly
concluded
that
the
rule
of
this
court
in
the
connolly-sewer
pipe
case
had
either
been
abrogated
--
or
strike
that,
that
the
rule
of
the
connolly-sewer
pipe
case
was
the
true
rule
and
that
the
rule
of
this
court
in
the
continental
wall
paper
company
case
had
either
been
abrogated
or
modified
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
so-called
wilder
case
and
in
the
so-called
bruce's
juices
case.
following
the
action
of
the
district
court
in
that
respect
in
striking
the
affirmative
answers,
a
summary
judgment
was
entered.
on
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit,
that
court,
relying
upon
the
same
authorities
as
the
district
courts
principally,
the
connolly-sewer
pipe
case,
the
wilder
case
and
bruce's
juices
case,
they
seemingly
concluded
that
the
rule
of
the
continental
wall
paper
case
which
they
recognized
was
contrary
in
its
result
from
that
reached
in
the
connolly
case
was
a
rule
that
could
be
applied
only
where
the
members
of
an
antitrust
combination
were
particularly
vicious.
and
that
unless
the
combination
relied
upon
by
the
defendant
in
seeking
avoidance
of
the
obligation
was
a
particularly
vicious
combination
that
the
rule
of
the
continental
wall
paper
case
wouldn't
apply.
and
it
is
in
substance
with
this
finding
and
disposition
of
the
cause
by
the
seventh
circuit
with
which
petitioner
here
takes
exception.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
petitioner's
application
and
representation
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
erroneously
construed
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
holding
that
a
contract,
illegal
because
of
the
sherman
act,
could
not
be
defended
against
by
a
party
thereto
upon
those
grounds.
it
is
agreed
in
this
proceeding
by
the
brief
filed
by
the
respondent
herein
that
the
virtue
of
the
issue
is
not
to
be
tested
by
the
technicalities
or
the
niceties
of
the
pleading.
but
that
squarely
presented
is
the
fundamental
and
the
germane
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
the
rule
of
this
court
that
in
a
suit
to
recover
the
purchase
price
of
a
commodity
involved
in
interstate
commerce
where
the
defendant
alleges
that
the
very
contract
upon
which
the
suit
is
brought
to
recover
that
purchase
price
is
violative
of
the
sherman
act
whether
such
a
defense
is
or
is
not
a
good
defense
or
is
a
defense
that
can
be
interposed.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that
has
been
dismissed
on
motion
in
the
district
court.
the
disposition
of
that
motion
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
no
reliance
upon
that
matter
is
placed
by
the
petitioner
herein
at
this
stage.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that
is
the
damage.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that's
the
damage.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
the
courts
below
as
does
the
respondent
in
the
brief
filed
herein
placed
a
great
weight
upon
the
so-called
non-delivery
aspect
of
the
agreement.
your
honors
will
note
that
one
of
the
integral
and
essential
aspects
of
the
agreement
as
alleged
by
the
defendant
was
that
neither
they
as
purchasers
of
these
287
carloads
nor
the
--
the
plaintiff,
kosuga
and
his
associate
siegel
would
deliver
any
of
the
onions
aggregating
in
total
about
1000
car
loads
of
onions
for
the
balance
of
the
trading
season.
now,
the
court
below
without
deciding
whether
or
not
that
non-delivery
feature
of
the
contract
was
or
was
not
illegal,
without
squarely
so
deciding
as
seemingly
emphasized
that
as
justifying
a
disposition
to
segregate
the
non-delivery
aspect
of
the
entire
undertaking
from
what
was
in
truth
and
in
fact
the
real
undertaking
of
the
parties,
namely,
an
undertaking
to
affect
prices,
to
fix
prices.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
agreement.
in
the
brief
which
the
respondent
here
has
filed
with
this
court,
i.e.,
is
undertaken
to
state
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
to
be
that
the
contract
was
violative
of
section
1
by
reason
of
the
non
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
the
(inaudible)
and
the
district
court
and
the
respondent
would
have
us
test
the
legality
or
the
illegality
of
this
underlying
agreement
by
reference
solely
to
the
non-delivery
aspect
in
this
--
as
it
related
to
this
particular
undertaking
between
kosuga
and
kelly.
it
is
our
feeling
and
we
respectfully
urge
that
that
is
unwarrantably
narrow
and
restricted
and
incomplete
view
of
the
entire
undertaking
because
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
entire
undertaking
had,
as
its
essential
and
inherent
ingredient,
an
illegal
purpose,
namely,
the
manipulation
of
prices.
and
just
like
the
purchase
by
kelly
of
the
50
carloads
and
the
purchase
by
any
of
the
others
similarly
situated
with
kelly
of
a
portion
of
these
287
carloads
and
just
as
the
withholding
from
the
market
of
each
and
every
one
of
those
was
but
one
of
the
overt
acts
agreed
upon
by
these
parties
as
alleged
by
the
defendant
below
and
the
petitioner
here
to
affect
and
manipulate
the
price
of
onions
on
the
cash
and
the
futures
market.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
no.
it
is
agreed
that
both
parties
--
both
sides
of
the
transaction
agreed
with
themselves
and
with
all
of
the
others
concerned
that
none
of
them
would
deliver
any
portion
of
these
1000
cars
of
onions
on
either
of
the
cash
or
the
futures
market.
that
was
--
that's
agreed
that
they
would
all
withhold
of
the
1000.
these
people
associated
or
similarly
situated
with
kelly
agreed
to
purchase
287
and
to
withhold
those.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
parties
to
this
agreement
who
held
then
the
balance
of
1000
agreed
that
they,
in
consideration
of
this
entire
undertaking,
would
withhold
all
of
theirs
from
both
the
cash
and
the
futures
market.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that's
by
agreement,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that
is
one
of
the
aspects
which
the
desired
position
was
but
one
of
the
overt
acts
which
these
people
agreed
they
would
employ
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
legal
objective,
namely,
manipulating
and
controlling
the
price
of
onions.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
we
were
a
voluntary
coconspirator
in
pari
delicto
and
each
of
them
was
similarly
so
situated.
now,
that
brings
us,
we
believe,
squarely
to
the
proposition
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
the
--
the
rule
of
law
as
pronounced
by
this
court
that
one
who
is
a
voluntary
participant
in
pari
delicto
with
others
can
repudiate
a
contract
and
successfully
defend
against
a
suit
for
the
purchase
price
of
the
article
where
the
very
contract
or
the
undertaking
which
is
sought
to
be
enforced
is
simultaneously
the
undertaking
which
had,
for
its
subjective,
the
accomplishment
of
an
illegal
purpose,
namely,
the
fixing
of
prices.
we
have
not
labored
in
the
brief,
submitted
except
by
reference
in
a
footnote
to
a
number
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
proposition
that
price
fixing
agreements
are
per
se
illegal.
very
recently,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
in
speaking
for
the
court
in
united
states
against
mckesson
&
robbins,
very
clearly
spelled
out
that
the
illegality
of
any
price
fixing
arrangement
does
not
depend
upon
whether
the
arrangement
was
unreasonable
or
reasonable.
it
does
not
depend
on
the
motive
of
the
parties
whether
good
or
evil.
it
doesn't
depend
on
whether
the
price
fixed
is
accomplished
by
contract
or
as
in
this
instance,
by
some
more
subtle
device,
namely,
the
withholding
of
this
large
quantity
of
onions
from
the
market
or
whether
the
participants
possess
market
control
or
the
extent
of
control
effected
by
the
price
fixing
arrangement
or
whether
the
agreement
is
effective
or
not.
i
think
it
too
well
settled
and
too
late
in
the
day
for
anyone
seriously
to
challenge
the
proposition
announced
by
this
court
on
enumerable
occasions
that
price
fixing
agreements
are
illegal
per
se.
and
that
any
undertaking
calculated
to
affect
a
price
fix
is
per
se
illegal.
and
that
stems
from
the
inherent
policy
underlying
sections
1
to
7
of
the
sherman
act.
now
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
it
was
decided
on
the
motion
to
strike
this
affirmative
answer
that
this
contract
was
per
se
an
illegal
contract
because
it
constituted
an
entire
undertaking
by
the
parties
to
attempt
to
fix
and
manipulate
prices.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
no,
they
do
not.
and
that
that
we
respectfully
submit
brought
into
focus
an
issue
of
fact
which
should
properly
have
been
tried
because
the
opponents
did
file
an
answer
in
addition
to
the
motion
to
strike.
but
we
never
got
to
the
answer
because
the
motion
to
strike
was
granted.
now,
it
is
our
belief
that
we
are
not
here
concerned
primarily
with
the
character
of
the
litigants
whether
the
litigants
are
good,
bad
or
indifferent.
now,
we
respectfully
submit,
it's
beside
the
point.
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
whether
or
not
the
character
of
the
contract
--
of
the
entire
contract,
not
just
the
portion
taken
out
of
context
by
the
plaintiff
but
whether
or
not
the
character
of
the
entire
contract
which
the
defendant
by
his
pleading
offered
to
show
was
or
was
not
illegal.
and
perhaps,
our
consideration
with
that
--
of
that
proposition
begins
with
a
reference
first
to
the
connolly-sewer
pipe
case
decided
in
1902
by
this
court.
the
connolly
case
was
an
action
in
one
instance
commenced
on
promissory
notes
given
by
the
purchaser
of
sewer
pipe
as
consideration
for
that
purchase.
and
in
the
consolidated
action,
a
second
suit
brought
by
the
pipe
manufacturer
against
a
man
by
the
name
of
dee
in
illinois.
it
was
on
an
open
account
for
pipe
sold
to
mr.
dee.
and
there,
connolly
and
dee
defended
or
sought
to
defend
the
suit
on
the
claim
that
the
seller
itself
was
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
summon
substance
of
the
decision
of
this
court
was
that
in
as
much
as
there
was
no
claim
that
the
contract
of
purchase
between
connolly
and
the
sewer
pipe
company
and
between
dee
and
the
sewer
pipe
company
was
a
contract
in
restraint
of
trade
that
the
defense
of
violation
of
the
sherman
act
was
not
available
to
them.
the
court
very
carefully
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
claim,
that
there
was
anything
in
the
contract
of
sale
between
the
sewer
pipe
company
and
its
two
customers
that
was
in
anyway
suggestive
of
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
that
what
those
defendants
there
relied
upon
was
the
antecedent
claimed
illegality
of
the
manufacturer
of
the
sewer
pipe
entering
into
a
combination
with
other
manufacturers
but
in
no
way
related
to
these
customers.
and
the
court
said
that
under
those
circumstances
because
the
illegality
alleged
by
the
customers
was
not
inherent
in
the
contract
upon
which
suit
was
bought,
the
defense
could
not
be
sustained.
two
months
later,
this
court
in
1902,
in
may
of
1902,
decided
the
beeman
case.
now,
without
making
any
reference
to
its
decision
in
the
connolly
case,
in
the
beeman
case,
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
peckham,
i
believe,
said,
“we
are
of
the
opinion
that
anyone
sued
upon
a
contract
may
set
up
a
defense
that
it
is
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,”
and
it
found
to
be
so
that
fact
will
constitute
a
good
defense
to
the
action.
and
further
in
the
opinion,
the
court's
in
but
that
that
does
not
prevent
a
private
individual
when
sued
upon
a
contract
which
is
void
as
in
violation
of
the
act
from
setting
it
up
as
a
defense.
and
we
think
when
proved,
it
is
a
valid
defense
to
any
claim
made
under
a
contract
thus
denounced
as
illegal.
some
seven
years
later,
in
1909,
this
court
met
with
and
dealt
with
the
question,
but
for
the
first
time
in
1909,
it
was
presented
on
a
proposition
that
the
contract
sued
upon
in
and
of
itself
was
illegal
in
that
that
contract,
and
i
refer
to
the
continental
wall
paper
case
decided
in
1909,
in
that
contract
itself,
between
the
seller
and
the
buyer,
there
were
restrictive
conditions,
which
on
their
face,
constituted
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
that
too,
as
in
this
instant
case,
was
a
suit
for
the
recovery
of
the
purchase
price
of
wall
paper
sold
to
the
defendant.
and
the
defendant
there
defended
upon
the
proposition
that
the
contract
upon
which
the
suit
was
brought
on
its
face
was
violative
of
the
sherman
act
and
hence,
this
court
reasoned,
since
--
in
maintaining
the
suit,
the
plaintiff
had
to
bring
into
issue
and
had
to
rely
upon
a
contract
which
was
illegal.
the
plaintiff
could
not
maintain
its
action
and
the
defense
asserted
that
their
contract
was
illegal,
was
a
good,
adequate
and
sufficient
defense.
now,
just
as
the
respondent
here
relies
a
great
length
upon
the
rule
of
the
connolly
case,
the
petitioner
here
relies
a
great
length
upon
the
rule,
as
initially
stated
in
the
beeman
case
and
then
as
approved
in
continental
wall
paper
case
where
the
exact
same
result
for
which
the
petitioner
here
contends
was
achieved
by
virtue
of
the
decision
in
the
continental
wall
paper
case.
but
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
district
court
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
dm
wilder
case
decided
in
1915
either
abrogated
or
modified
the
rule
in
the
continental
wall
paper
case.
in
analysis
of
the
wilder
case,
however,
discloses
that
thereto
as
in
the
connolly
case,
the
customer,
the
purchaser
who
sought
to
avoid
the
obligation
to
pay
by
reliance
upon
the
sherman
act
was
not
himself
a
party
to
an
agreement
that
was
inherently
illegal.
he
was
a
stranger
to
any
illegality.
and
it
was
frankly
conceded
apparently
at
the
oral
argument
because
a
careful
reading
of
the
case
discloses
that
it
is
pointed
out
that
the
customer
in
that
situation
made
no
claim
that
the
contract
upon
which
the
suit
was
brought
was
in
itself
illegal
except
when
viewed
through
the
eyes
of
the
seller
whom
it
was
claimed,
was
together
with
other
manufacturers
of
glucose
associated
in
a
combination
of
restraint
of
trade.
but
there,
as
in
the
connolly
case,
the
illegality
of
the
--
of
the
plaintiff
was
no
part
of
the
illegality
of
the
contract
upon
which
the
suit
was
brought.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
true
rationale
or
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
the
continental
case.
i
think
that
the
true
basis
while
that
is
referred
to
and
that
was
a
factor
there
present
in
the
continental
case,
it
appears
to
us
that
the
true
rationale
of
the
continental
case
is
really
but
a
restatement
of
the
old
proposition
that
the
courts
will
not
enforce
a
contract
as
to
which
the
parties
are
in
pari
delicto
and
the
contract
is
illegal.
and
that
the
court
will
leave
the
parties
where
they
found
them
and
will
not
enforce
it.
i
think
that
that
is
the
true
rationale
of
the
continental
case.
and
i
--
i
think
that
we
find
support
for
that
proposition
by
reference
to
the
next
pronouncement
of
this
court
in
1925
in
the
small
against
lamborn
decision
where
the
court
there
expressly
approved
the
tryst
proposition
stated
in
the
--
restating
the
connolly
case
that
the
courts
will
not
enforce
a
contract
that
is
illegal
as
violative
of
the
sherman
act
where
the
suit
is
brought
upon
that
contract
but
held
in
the
--
in
small
against
lamborn
that
the
--
the
rule
of
the
continental
case
was
inapplicable
for
the
reason
that
there
again,
as
in
wilder
and
as
in
connolly,
the
illegality
did
not
inhere
in
the
contract
upon
which
the
suit
was
brought
but
was
antecedent
to
and
wholly
unrelated
to
the
contract
of
purchase
upon
which
the
suit
was
brought.
and
in
1942,
this
court
again
had
occasion
to
review
the
question,
and
that
was
in
sola
electric
against
jefferson.
that
case,
like
this
one,
arose
from
the
seventh
circuit.
and
mr.
chief
justice
stone
speaking
for
the
unanimous
court
ruled
in
this
situation
that
the
defense
of
illegality
inherent
in
the
contract
by
virtue
of
it
being
violative
of
the
sherman
act
was
a
perfectly
proper
defense.
and
it
arose
in
this
way,
the
petitioner
in
the
sola
electric
company
case
there
asserted
that
by
reason
of
the
price
control
provisions
of
its
licensing
arrangement
with
the
jefferson
manufacturing
company,
that
the
jefferson
manufacturing
company
was
not
entitled
to
royalties.
it
being
there,
the
sola
electric
company's
further
claim
that
this
arrangement,
this
contract
was
without
the
immunity
from
the
sherman
act
supported
--
available
otherwise
by
a
valid
patent.
in
other
words,
had
there
been
a
valid
patent,
the
immunity
from
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
would
have
been
enforced
and
this
question
could
not
have
arisen.
but
the
sola
electric
company
took
the
position
that
the
patent
was
not
a
valid
patent
and
hence
a
price
fixing
arrangement
contained
in
the
licensing
contract
was
illegal
as
violative
of
the
sherman
act
and
that
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
show
as
they
asked
by
their
affirmative
pleadings
in
the
suit
to
--
in
the
suit
to
recover
royalties
that
the
contract
upon
which
the
suit
was
brought
was
as
to
that
aspect
of
it,
violative
of
the
sherman
act.
and
in
reversing
the
seventh
circuit
and
speaking
for
the
unanimous
court,
mr.
chief
justice
stone
said,
“similarly,
this
court
has
declared
that
anyone
sued
upon
a
contract
may
set
up
as
a
defense
that
it
is
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
it
has
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
whether
the
parties
to
an
agreement
in
violation
of
the
act
are
in
pari
delicto
as
a
question
of
federal
not
state
law.”
it
decided
the
continental
wall
paper
company
--
it
decided
in
continental
wall
paper
company
that
a
vendee
of
goods
purchased
from
an
illegal
combination
in
pursuance
of
an
illegal
agreement
both
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
can
cleave
the
illegality
in
defense
to
a
suit
for
the
recovery
of
the
purchase
price.
this
decision
went
much
farther
than
is
necessary
to
go
here
to
conclude
that
petitioner
may
assert
the
illegality
of
the
price
fixing
agreement
and
may
offer
any
competent
evidence
to
establish
its
illegality
including
proof
of
the
invalidity
of
the
patent.
now,
that
was
in
1942.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that
is
not
conceded.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
it
is
not
conceded
but,
of
course,
there's
been
no
trial
on
the
merit
side.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
there's
no
trial
on
the
merit
side.
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
striking
this
affirmative
defense,
we
were
effectively
precluded
from
showing
what
the
entire
contract
was
and
that
the
contract
was
in
truth
and
in
fact
as
we
alleged.
it
was
entered
into
by
all
of
these
persons
for
the
express
in
the
avowed
purpose
of
manipulating
prices.
now
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
well,
on
that
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
--
score,
i
respectfully
direct
your
--
your
attention
to
the
allegations
in
the
answer
contained
on
page
11
and
then
again
under
the
caption
“affirmative
defense”
on
pages
13,
14
and
15
and
perhaps
most
specifically,
i
would
respectfully
direct
your
attention,
mr.
justice
stewart,
to
paragraph
5
of
page
15
where
after
reciting
now
what
had
transpired
between
these
parties,
we
allege
that
the
avowed
in
the
express
object
of
the
agreement
was
to
manipulate
the
market
prices
of
onions
and
to
stabilize
said
prices
and
if
possible
increase
that
prices.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
seventh
circuit
considered
that
in
--
a
conclusory
allegation
but
that
taken
in
connection
with
that
which
we
--
which
precedes
where
we
spell
out
the
agreement
in
what
was
done
without
pleading
the
facts
and
pleading
the
conversations
between
the
parties,
we
respectfully
submit,
is
an
allegation
of
fact
which
we
had
a
right
to
prove.
in
1942
or
perhaps
it
was
a
few
years
later
than
that,
1947
it
must
have
been,
there
was
another
case
before
this
court
and
another
case
upon
which
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
district
court
as
well
as
the
respondent
extensively
rely
and
that's
the
bruce's
juices
case.
and
i
must
say
a
word
about
that
case.
there,
a
suit
was
brought
by
the
manufacturer
of
cans
sold
to
bruce's
juices,
a
--
an
organization
engaged
in
the
--
apparently,
the
canning
of
the
fruit
juices
of
some
kind.
the
suit
was
actually
upon
notes
given
by
bruce's
juices
which
represented
the
balances
owing
upon
an
open
account
to
the
manufacturer
of
the
cans.
and
the
--
the
customer,
the
purchaser
there
sought
to
avoid
liability
on
those
notes
by
asserting
that
the
sales
to
it
had
been
made
in
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act
in
that
there
had
been
price
discriminations
by
the
vendor
denounced
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
discrimination
against
the
defendant.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
against
the
defendant
that
the
discounts
that
had
been
made
available
to
competitors
of
the
defendant's
had
exceeded
those
which
had
been
made
available
to
the
defendant,
bruce's
juices.
by
5-to-4
decision,
this
court
held,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
jackson,
that
you
would
not
read
into
the
robinson-patman
act
the
non-collectibility
right
of
a
defendant's
sued
for
the
purchase
price
of
a
commodity
sold
even
though
it
were
sold
in
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
but
mr.
justice
jackson
was
very
careful
to
point
out
in
that
decision
that
the
rule
with
respect
to
the
right
of
a
purchaser
to
defend
in
an
action
to
recover
the
purchase
price
is
wholly
different
under
the
robinson-patman
act
than
it
is
under
the
sherman
act.
and
mr.
justice
jackson
very
carefully
pointed
that
out.
four
of
the
then
justices
of
the
court
wanted
to
read
into
the
robinson-patman
act
the
non-collectibility
as
an
aspect
of
the
--
implied
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
but
the
majority
of
the
court
decided
otherwise.
but
in
any
event,
it
was
there
clearly
distinguished
that
bruce's
juices
stood
strictly
on
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
not
upon
a
construction
or
an
interpretation
of
sections
1
to
7
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
but
whether
they
were
a
victim
in
the
bruce's
juices
case,
i
don't
know
if
it
was
entirely
clear
from
that
--
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
any
event
that
they
did
buy
them.
there
were
other
factors
in
the
situation.
the
court,
i
recall,
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
if
not
mechanically
impossible
to
associate
with
which
sales
there
had
been
a
price
differential
and
that
the
mechanics
of
it
were
such
that
it
would
work
a
very
great
difficulty
in
effecting
and
understanding.
and
in
any
event,
they
also
pointed
out
as
your
honor
will
recall
that
there
were
remedies
available
that
the
--
that
the
congress
had
enacted
remedies
available
to
bruce's
juices
under
the
robinson-patman
act
whereby
they
could
recover
whatever
loss
they
might
have
sustained
by
virtue
of
their
having
done
business
with
the
vendor.
and
by
that,
of
course,
is
not
an
analogous
situation
here
because
here,
all
of
these
parties
were
in
pari
delicto.
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
case
that
has
been
argued
extensively
in
the
briefs
and
relied
upon
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
by
the
district
court
is
the
so-called
“severability”
of
the
obligation
here
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
for
the
defendant
to
pay
for
these
onions.
that
obligation
being
severable
from
the
entire
undertaking
and
understanding
between
the
parties
and
i
think
that
we
can
--
we
can
go
back
to
the
pronouncement
of
this
court
in
mcmullen
against
hoffman
for
a
very
early
and
exhaustive
discussion
of
what
is
severable
and
what
is
not
severable
in
a
contract
of
this
kind.
reading
the
mcmullen
against
hoffman
case
stands
for
two
propositions.
it
stands
for
the
--
the
common
law
proposition
now
applicable
in
a
situation
of
this
kind,
we
feel,
by
virtue
of
the
enactment
of
the
sherman
act
that
the
courts
will
not
enforce
as
between
wrongdoers
and
we
frankly
stand
before
you
and
say
we
were
wrongdoers,
all
of
them
were
wrongdoers.
they
were
trying
to
fix
prices.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
no,
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me
a
question
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
and
i
answered
no,
that
has
been
abandoned.
but
of
course,
that
was
alleged
in
the
alternative
to
them,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
mcmullen
case,
i
think,
stands
further
for
the
proposition
that
that
which
is
--
the
bet
is
not
collateral
which
is
any
facet
of
the
underlying
integrated
agreement.
and
as
was
stated
in
that
--
in
that
case,
a
plaintiff
can't
pick
and
choose
the
portions
of
the
contract
upon
which
you
will
die
in
seeking
to
recover
where
the
defendant
has
it
within
his
power
and
he
alleges
what
the
entire
overall
transaction
was
then
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
to
recover
is
to
be
determined
what
all
of
the
contract
was
and
not
by
some
facet,
some
integral
but
nonetheless
a
facet
of
the
overall
undertaking.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
certain
answers
to
certain
questions
put
by
the
court
and
by
various
members
of
the
court
that
i
feel
suggest
a
necessity
for
some
further
explanatory
answer.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
written
contract
here.
this
was
an
oral
undertaking.
and
we
start
with
that
premise.
secondly,
whether
the
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
oh,
yes,
surely,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
is
our
understanding
and
it
is
our
allegation
that
the
terms
of
the
agreement
were
that
these
onions
would
be
purchased
and
withheld
from
the
market
for
the
avowed
and
expressed
purpose
of
affecting,
manipulating
the
price
of
onions
on
both
the
cash
and
the
futures
market
as
we
have
alleged
and
i'll
respectfully
refer
you
to
page
14
of
the
record.
i'm
asked
for,
they
say
“no”.
they
say
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
what
were
they,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
here
were
a
group
of
growers
of
onions
who
were
also
speculators
on
the
futures
market.
and
that
included
mr.
siegel,
mr.
kosuga,
mr.
kelly
and
all
of
the
persons
who
were
a
party
to
this
december
17
oral
undertaking.
they
were
speculators
as
well
as
farmers
and
growers.
that's
what
they
were.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
and
this
suit
was
for
the
recovery
of
the
purchased
price
of
one
portion
of
the
287
cars
which
kelly
agreed
himself
along
with
all
of
the
others
would
be
his
allocated
portion
of
the
greater
number
of
287
which
he
would
have
to
buy
if
the
others
were
going
to
buy
some
and
if
the
plaintiff,
kosuga
and
his
associate,
mr.
siegel,
were
to
do
what
they
promise
to
do,
namely,
to
avoid
depression
of
the
market
by
delivering
a
thousand
carloads
of
onions
on
the
futures
market.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
no,
it
was
--
well,
it
was
for
the
recovery
of
the
purchased
price
of
50
carloads
of
physical
onions.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
yes,
your
honor.
that's
right.
but
may
i
say
this.
in
that
connection,
and
i
think
that
that
comes
very
close
to
the
nexus
of
the
proposition,
the
futures
market
and
incidentally,
there
is
no
treaty
on
the
futures
market
in
onions
anymore.
since
this
litigation
arose,
the
congress
has
abolished
it.
so
there
is
no
futures
trading
in
the
onions
market
anymore.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
futures
onion
market
largely,
as
a
matter
of
economics,
controls
the
cash
market
price
of
onions.
and
hence,
a
disposition
to
withdraw
and
an
agreement
when
a
combination
in
a
conspiracy
to
withdraw
and
not
to
deliver
a
thousand
carloads
on
the
futures
market
would
have,
as
is
alleged
by
the
defendant,
a
ruinous
and
catastrophic
effect
on
the
cash
market.
and
that
was
alleged
by
the
defendant
as
shown
on
the
record
in
page
14.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
economics,
it
necessarily
follows
that
such
is
a
fact
that
--
that
to
take
100
carloads
or
not
a
hundred,
a
thousand
--
a
hundred
would
even
do
it,
but
to
take
a
thousand
carloads
of
onions
and
deliver
those
on
the
futures
market
in
satisfaction
of
outstanding
contracts
at
that
time
would
immediately
reverberate
into
the
cash
market
instantaneously.
and
the
price
of
onions
on
both
the
futures
and
on
the
cash
market
would,
of
course,
go
down
that
trajectory.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
i
think
mr.
kelly
did
not
pick
up
37
carloads
of
onions
or
approximately
37
carloads.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
he
did
pick
up
approximately
13
and
he
did
not
pick
up
some
approximate
37.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
where
were
those
onions?
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
they
were
$960
per
car
plus
storage
charges.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
approximately,
without
reference
to
the
storage
charges,
my
brother
is
correct
when
he
says
that
a
--
that
figurative
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
that's
right
because
on
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
--
under
the
arrangement,
the
storage
charges
that
it
accumulated
on
the
onions
already
received
had
to
be
paid
at
the
time
they
were
taken
out
of
storage
because
the
warehouse
receipt
wouldn't
be
delivered
until
all
of
the
charges
have
been
paid.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
i
--
i'm
not
certain,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
--
in
my
opinion,
that
isn't
material
to
the
issue
here
at
all
wether
they
became
the
property
of
--
of
kelly
at
that
time
or
became
the
property
of
these
other
purchasers
at
that
time
or
not.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
germane
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
overall
undertaking
by
all
of
these
parties
was
an
illegal
undertaking
denounced
by
the
sherman
act.
i
think
that's
the
real
issue
and
then
the
necessary
corollary
as
to
whether
or
not
assuming
that
it
was
an
illegal
undertaking
whether
or
not
that
defense
cannot
successfully
be
asserted
by
the
purchaser
of
the
onions.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
no.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
the
theory
was
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
the
agreement
was
that
they
would
do
what
was
necessary
to
manipulate,
stabilize
the
price
of
onions
on
the
cash
and
futures
market.
one
of
the
instruments,
the
instrumentalities
by
which
they
sought,
they
chose
and
agreed
upon
to
exercise
to
accomplish
that
illegal
purpose
was
to
withhold
from
the
futures
market
the
delivery
of
some
1000
carloads
of
onions.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
they
would
never
during
that
trading
season.
i
should
perhaps
explain
that
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
free
to
--
free
to
sell
them
in
the
normal
routine
outlet
such
as
to
the
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
or
to
whomsoever
would
buy
them.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
to
be
delivered.
i
think
that
we
would
be
mislead
if
we
didn't
appreciate
that
it
is
not
at
all
uncommon
for
physical
onions
to
be
--
to
have
been
delivered
in
the
days
when
they
trade
it
in
the
futures
at
the
chicago
commodity
exchange.
i
think
that
we
would
be
mislead
if
we
were
of
the
impression
that
it
was
uncommon
for
physical
onions
or
evidence
of
ownership
of
physical
onions
to
be
delivered
in
satisfaction
of
future
--
futures
contracts
on
the
exchange.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
in
very
substantial
quantities,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
it
would
be
common.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
well,
onions
are
one
of
the
very
few
commodities
upon
which
futures
trading
was
permitted.
and
now,
since
the
initiation
of
this
--
of
this
litigation,
the
congress
has
legislated
against
it
and
its
bandit,
so
there
is
no
longer
any
futures
trading
of
onions.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
in
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
well
--
mr.
joseph
w.
louisell
we
come
to
grips
--
the
security
with
that,
and
may
i
say
this
in
answer
to
a
question
which
has
been
post
here.
would
you
be
(inaudible),
were
you
to
reverse
this
and
send
it
back
where
the
issue
would
be
tried
on
its
merits
as
to
whether
this
contract
was,
as
the
petitioner
here
claims
it
was,
an
illegal
combination
in
restraint
of
trade?
would
you,
by
so
doing,
be
enhancing
or
approving
or
adapting
the
policy
which
is
always
been
the
policy
of
the
courts
not
to
enforce
an
illegal
contract?
and
i
answer
that
by
referring
to
the
language
in
the
continental
wall
paper
company
case
wherein
it
is
there
pointed
out
that
if
the
plaintiff
had
been
allowed
to
recover
in
the
continental
wall
paper
case,
the
court
would
have
been
giving
a
judgment
for
a
sum
which
was
made
up
in
execution
of
the
agreement
out
of
which
came
the
illegal
combination.
and
if
this
judgment
stands,
the
same
result
follows.
this
court
then
would
be
allowing
a
judgment
to
stand
for
a
sum
of
money
which
is
made
up
in
execution
of
the
agreement
out
of
which
came
the
allegedly
illegal
combination.
now,
the
nexus
of
the
entire
problem,
i
think
as
it
--
it
was
briefed
and
as
it
was
intended
to
be
presented
to
this
court
is
simply
this,
whether
or
not
the
purchaser
of
a
commodity
may
rely
upon
the
illegality
of
the
contract,
illegal
because
of
the
sherman
act
as
the
defense.
and
for
that
proposition,
we
say
this
court
has
never
deviated
from
the
rule
that
such
is
permissible
as
stated
in
the
continental
wall
paper
company
case
that
that
is
the
rule
and
that
it
should
have
been
applied
here
and
that
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
court
were
in
error
when
they
said
that
this
court
had
washed
down,
if
i
may
use
that
expression,
or
weakened
the
policy
as
stated
by
this
court
in
the
continental
case.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
not
the
fact.
