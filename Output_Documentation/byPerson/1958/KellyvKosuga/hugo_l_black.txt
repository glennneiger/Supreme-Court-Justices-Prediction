suppose
a
group
of
people
agree
(inaudible)
sell
not
to
make
any
deliveries
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
it
your
contention
that
that
was
not
violating
the
antitrust
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
people
--
the
people
agreed
to
make
agreement
in
this
filed
of
the
so-called
trade
which
sometimes
is
unstable
but
is
accepted
evidently
as
a
trading
business.
why
would
the
contract
made
to
restrain
the
execution
of
contracts
that
that
deal
the
end
of
the
lesser
violation
of
the
sherman
act
than
any
other
such
contracts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
facts
in
your
case
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
question
that
i
asked
because
i
--
i
didn't
quite
understand
how
the
sherman
act
which
prohibits
all
these
contracts
in
restraint
of
trade
could
possibly
limit
the
contracts
of
the
delivery
date.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
may
i
ask
you
this,
that
--
that
puzzled
me
a
little.
and
that's
probably
because
i
don't
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
may
i
just
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
did
get
it
at
the
then
market
value
but
suppose
the
then
market
value
had
been
affected
by
the
unlawful
agreement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
would
be
reserved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

the
continental
case.
i
have
the
case
before
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
you
are
reading.
justice
hugo
l.
black
253.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
--
excuse
me
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
was
interested
in
your
discussion
of
bruce's
juices.
i've
just
read
it
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
thought
that
the
court
expressly
refused
to
say
that
the
rule
applied
in
that
case
in
spite
the
sherman
act
violation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
yet
quite
understand
this
contract
you
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
contract
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
were
the
onions
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
already
grown
in
chicago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
shipped
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
in
car.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
were
the
--
was
the
contract
made
to
take
them
at
a
future
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
them
on
credit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
installment
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
was
it
that
you
notified
of
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
onions
gone
down
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
made
a
statement
to
that
(inaudible)
i
didn't
quite
understand.
you
said,
after
the
goods
were
delivered.
i
thought
parts
of
the
goods
were
not
delivered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
they
refused
to
pay
for
the
onions
that
had
already
been
delivered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i'm
--
i
--
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
they
made
the
contract
(inaudible)
what
onions
--
did
they
pay
for
the
all
the
onions
they
got
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
does
this
involve
refusal
to
pay
for
some
onions
they've
got
or
refusal
to
pay
for
the
onions
that
they
said
they
wouldn't
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
13,
what
would
that
amount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
paid
for
about
what
they
got
to
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
ones
they
withdrew,
did
they
pay
for
all
they
withdrew
or
did
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
look
--
i
was
looking
at
the
record
on
page
5
and
i
couldn't
tell.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
ask
one
other
question.
you
say
that
what
they
allege
in
conclusion
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
were
wrong
(inaudible)
and
that
was
the
avowed
expression
(inaudible)
to
stabilize,
it'll
be
liability.
that
has
not
yet
been
tested
as
to
whether
they
could
establish
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
a
question.
i
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
curiosity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
has
no
relevance
whatever.
how
many
onions
did
you
client
take
that
he
hasn't
paid
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
figure
shows
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
they
worth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
worth
per
carload?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
think
you
showed
them
that
you
paid
approximately
for
those
you
actually
got.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
where
include
you
for
