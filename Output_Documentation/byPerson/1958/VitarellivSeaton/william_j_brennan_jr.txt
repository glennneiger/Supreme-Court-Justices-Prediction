justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

that
add
up
to
what
you
are
contesting?
none
of
this
happened
at

in
1956,
then
they
sought

have
been
done
without
giving
him
this
opportunity
to
qualify

what

limitation
on

don't
know.
but
(inaudible)
that
the
act
was

facilitate
the
removal
on

some
reason

employment
was
not
fairly
consistent
with
the
national
security.
