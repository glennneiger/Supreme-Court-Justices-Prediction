justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
for
the
date?
when
--
when
was
the
dismissal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
satisfied
these
two
conditions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
not
been
covered
in
because
he
has
not
satisfied
the
two
conditions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
not
being
covered
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
he
is
not
within
the
protection
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
must
be
–
it
must
be
the
official
because
if
he
wouldn't
pass
an
examination,
the
office
can't
pass
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
first
condition,
he
must
pass
a
certain
examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
must
be
individual
and
not
--
and
not
abstract
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
would
be
eligible
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
quite
so,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
employee,
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
high
commissioner
has
to
give
in
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
wasn't
if
he
had
to
take
an
examination
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
assessment
must
be
made
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
he
–
that
must
be
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
saying
that
all
these
things
shouldn't
happen,
i
am
suggesting
they
haven't
happened,
and
it
is
not
within
the
protection
of
the
--
of
the
civil
service
commission
protection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
if
those
restrictions
were
illegal
imposed,
they
should
be
--
they
should
be
expunged
or
vacated,
so
that
then
the
process
by
which
he
could
become
again
may
become
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
mean
if
he
was
properly
fired
in
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
all
of
that
should
out.
i
think
i
am
making
a
(inaudible)
likely
in
my
mind.
if
this
(inaudible)
then
he
is
not
protected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
not
protect
in
all
fairness
or
according
to
all
honorable
fairness,
in
your
words,
he
ought
to
be
covered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
isn't
covered
by
the
--
if
he
isn't
covered,
if
he
isn't
protected
by
the
civil
service
safeguard,
he
maybe
fired
for
no
reason
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
says
that's
sufficient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
he
could
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
could
deny,
if
he
is
not
covered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
are
back
where
we
were.
i
don't
i
think
the
position
is
covered,
the
position
must
be
covered
but
he
must
be
selected
for
the
covered
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
may
not
disclose
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
says
on
the
hearing
during
which
he
was
illegally
discharged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
there
on
the
part
of
the
government
after
--
while
he
still
is
and
before
it
covers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
appeal
to
the
honor
of
the
department
and
not
to
any
coed
legal
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
we
decide
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
we
decide
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
might
trouble
to
ask
you
what
--
whether
any
general
policy
followed
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
cole
case,
is
there
any
--
generalized
to
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
happened
as
to
their
retention
after
discharge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
involved
a
good
many
employees,
isn't
it,
the
cole
--
the
decision
in
the
cole
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
we
can
stand
that.
thanks
mr.
laughlin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
supply
--
the
line
between
sensitive
and
insensitive
--
non-sensitive
areas,
your
figure
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
employees
removed
from
government
employment
pursuant
to
the
act
of
august
26,
1950
in
non
--
who
were
holding
at
their
time
of
removal
non-sensitive
positions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
you
mean
that
were
actually
removed
would
require
restoration
to
their
position,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
my
question
was
a
little
broader
than
that,
namely
how
many
were
potentially
affected
and
that
was
turned
into
hundred
or
thousand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
entitled,
that
would
atomically
follow,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
--
would
that
fall
giving
it
such
legal
validity
as
it
would
be
entitled
to
have
if
he
didn't
seek
retroactive
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whatever
he
is
entitled
to
prospectively
would
not
be
curtailed
or
limited
or
nullified
by
the
fact
that
he
did
more
than
any
of
(inaudible)
would
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
it
--
if
in
1956,
they
saw
it
retroactively
to
validate
what
was
invalid
in
1954,
it
couldn't
be
completely
nugatory
effect
if
it
could
have
prospective
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
if
it
could,
if
properly
praise
the
remark
to
the
court
to
give
retroactive
effect,
it
would
be
giving
prospective
effect
if
it's
legally
curtailed
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
that.
assume
a
man,
who
was
a
training
specialist
that
vitarelli
was,
assume
a
man
was
in
that
condition
at
the
time
that
the
position
was
covered
in
and
therefore
subject
to
civil
service
benefits.
would
such
a
person
automatically
--
would
such
a
person
automatically
be
now
under
civil
service
protection
in
that
position
or
would
he
have
to
be
appointed
as
such
under
the
new
covering
in
civil
service
faith?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
covering
in
the
position
does
not
necessitate
that
the
chief
should
recommend
him
for
the
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
be
qualified
--
he
may
be
qualified
with
the
one
out
of
three
--
one
in
three
selection
rule
apply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
depends
on
the
choice
of
the
head
of
the
division
or
department,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
what
21
remarks,
what's
the
significant
of
all
that
writing?
(inaudible)
what's
the
point
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
still
gather
you
didn't,
but
i
just
wonder
what
is
the
significance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
maybe
a
formula,
you've
got
(inaudible).
this
maybe
a
be
a
routine
way
of
qualifying
whatever
they
say
subject
to
whatever
they
may
or
may
not
be
subject
to
civil
service
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
a
bearing
on
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
formula
--
i
mean
--
it
has
application
--
it
has
application
so
they
stick
it
on
everywhere
on
each
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
would
be
very
easy
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
regular
form,
the
generality
--
but
there
are
no
instances
where
they
--
of
dismissals
or
of
suspension
under
the
competitive
classification,
and
therefore
they
used
this
form
when
it
is
not
in
the
competitive
class.
i
mean
that
would
not
surprise
me
it
is
a
public
document
that's
printed
or
censored,
but
easy
enough
to
find
out
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
we
would
like
to
know
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whose
language?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
we
can't
overrule
a
case
that
--
it's
stopped
by
overruling
any
sense,
and
doesn't
overrule
a
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
we
can't
overrule
a
case
that
isn't
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
suggest
that
if
subsequent
cases
have
laid
down
documents
that
contradict
bailey
below,
why
should
anybody
who
needs
the
legal
material
confidently
bother
about
what
the
lower
court
has
done
when
it's
to
be
wiped
out
in
principle
by
later
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
a
divided
--
a
divided
court
is
--
nearly
of
necessity
(inaudible)
mean
the
lower
court's
judgments
standing
on
necessity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
we
were
to
consider
all
the
ruling,
every
miscitation
of
even
the
most
eminent
counsel,
our
report
would
be
even
thicker
than
they
are?
