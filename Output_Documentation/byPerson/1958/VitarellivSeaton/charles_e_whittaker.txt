even
though
the
government
might
have
the
right
then
meanwhile
to
discharge
him,
because
it
didn't
like
the
color
of
his
hair?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
assume
that's
true.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that
would
be
void,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that
could
be
void.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right,
but
could
not
the
government
then
the
next
day
discharge
properly
just
by
saying,
you
are
discharged
without
reason?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
assume
that
that's
all
true
and
i
should
follow
that,
yet
would
not
that
status
end
when
the
government
did
properly
discharge
him?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
theory
is
he
has
never
been
discharged,
that
the
proceeding
up
until
that
time
was
for
the
discharge
was
only
void
and
ineffective
and
he
is
still
an
employee
and
entitled
to
pay.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
the
legal
effect
of
it,
if
your
other
argument
is
sound.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
you
are
saying
that
the
regulations
here
apply
only
to
the
case
where
the
person
had
the
tenure
under
civil
service,
but
did
not
apply
if
he
was
schedule
a
employee
(inaudible),
is
that
what
you
saying?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then
were
these
regulations
applicable
to
exercise
that
power?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
when
you
--
but
you
did
attempt
to
exercise
the
power
of
discharge
to
use
those
regulations.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
he
would
then
be
covered
in
civil
service
system
and
that
he
therefore
is
not
automatically
discharged
without
a
cause,
because
he
gets
