mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no,
no
none.
no
objection
on
behalf
of
the
government.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
will
work
on
that
tonight.
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
cole
v.
young,
we
concede
here
as
we
have
conceded
in
the
courts
below
that
petitioner's
removal
from
federal
employment
was
not
authorized
by
the
act
of
august
26th,
1950.
consistent
with
that
concession,
the
civil
service
commission
has
expunged
from
its
records
all
adverse
findings
relating
to
petitioner
that
were
taken
in
accordance
with
executive
order
10450.
the
department
of
interior
likewise
consistent
with
that
--
this
concession
has
similarly
expunged
its
personnel
records
with
respect
to
mr.
viteralli
of
all
implications
that
his
removal
from
government
service
was
pursuant
to
the
act
of
august
26
to
the
executive
order
and
to
the
departmental
order
and
there
is
no
basis
upon
his
--
from
his
personnel
record
from
which
anyone
could
infer
that
mr.
viteralli
is
or
was
a
security
risk,
whether
that
was
the
reason
or
is
the
reason
for
his
separation
from
government
service.
this
administrative
relief,
which
has
been
accorded
to
the
petitioner
is
a
substantial
compliance
with
the
--
one
of
the
prior
for
relief
that
he
sought
in
his
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court.
in
addition,
however,
he
asked
that
his
removal
in
1954
be
declared
invalid,
and
that
he
--
that
the
courts
direct
that
he
be
reinstated
to
his
former
position.
these
are
the
two
issues,
which
are
involved
in
this
case
as
we
view
it.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
his
removal
was
invalid
must
we
think
be
disassociated
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
authority
relied
upon
by
the
secretary
of
interior
was
erroneous.
we
concede
of
course
that
the
authority
far
fell
with
the
decision
in
cole
v.
young,
but
it
does
not
follow
because
the
secretary's
authority
that
he
relied
upon
has
fallen
that
the
removal
is
necessarily
invalid.
we
are
concerned
here
with
an
employee
who
is
not
a
veteran,
who
was
not
in
the
classified
civil
service,
as
such
his
employment
was
without
fixed
tenure,
and
he
was
at
all
times
subject
to
removal
for
cause
or
for
no
cause
or
for
a
reason
and
without
assignment
of
reason.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
generally
the
policy
was
if
the
employee
were
in
the
classified
--
i
--
i
don't
want
to
be
too
categorical
about
this,
because
i
know
of
one
instance
in
the
court
of
claims
where
restoration
was
made
on
the
strength
of
the
decision
in
cole
v.
young.
and
this
case,
we
cited
in
our
brief
as
the
langley
v.
united
states,
it
was
a
super
back
pay.
now
there
restoration
was
affected
but
that
involved
an
employee
who
was
subject
to
the
veterans'
preference
act
or
to
the
lloyd-la
follette
act.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
the
proceedings
either
had
the
--
whatever
proceedings
had
been
taken
were
either
expunged
from
the
record
and
commenced
new
or
another
possibility
which
might
have
been
open,
say
in
the
cole
case,
was
that
to
grant
him
an
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission,
which
was
the
procedural
right
that
it
was
denied
the
petitioner
in
the
cole
v.
young
case.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
it
--
i
don't
have
any
idea
how
many
it
was
in
terms
of
numbers
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
that
is
true,
i
don't
know
how
many
of
the
schedule
a
or
accepted
employees
were
affected
by
the
decision.
but
here
there
was
of
course
an
application
for
reinstatement
that
followed
immediately
after
the
court's
decision
in
cole
v.
young
that
was
denied
by
the
department
of
interior
for
reason
which
are
not
apparent.
so
i
suppose
and
i
would
hope
that
it
was
handled
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
and
that
there
was
no
fixed
policy
again
the
blanket
dismissal
of
all
such
employee,
but
rather
a
good
faith
reevaluation
of
the
action
that
had
been
taken
in
the
light
of
the
court's
decision.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes
that,
as
i
understand
it,
it
appears
on
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
unlike
mr.
justice
harlan
i
have
been
able
to
get
a
hold
of
that
entire
hearing
as
yet,
but
i
do
know
that
he
was
cleared
under
the
executive
order
9835
loyalty
program.
the
validity
of
his
removal
must
we
think
be
said
in
the
light
of
the
traditional
role
that
the
courts
have
played
where
employee
removals
are
involved.
this
of
course,
now
this
case
involves
a
removal
by
the
executive
which
had,
what
it
was,
without
any
limitations
as
to
your
procedural
or
substantive
--
of
a
substantive
character.
now
for
a
170
years
the
inquiry
of
the
courts
has
been
as
to
whether
or
not
the
removal
has
been
effective
in
compliance
with
the
procedural
limitations
that
had
been
imposed
upon
the
employment
either
by
congress
or
by
regulation
or
by
executive
order.
that
is
perhaps
open
to
another
limitation
that
being
whether
or
not
the
removal
was
effective
for
some
patently
arbitrary
or
discriminatory
reason.
here
however
we
are
dealing
with
an
employee
at
will
without
any
tenure
and
no
procedural
rights,
statutory
regulatory
were
involved
in
affecting
his
removal.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit,
that
there
is
no
basis
upon
which
this
court
may
invalidate
that
removal.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
in
our
view
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
not
necessarily.
first
of
all
in
our
view
the
regulations
fall
with
the
statute
if
the
--
we
can
see
of
course
the
statute
did
not
authorize
his
removal.
the
regulations
were
promulgated
in
accordance
with
the
statute
and
the
executive
order.
so
we
fell
it
would
be
bit
contradictory
to
say
that
while
he
was
not
entitled
to
the
procedural
protections
of
the
statute
or
he
was
no
authorized
could
not
have
been
dismissed
under
the
authority
of
the
statute
that
the
regulations
implementing
that
statute
there
--
yes
that
they
--
the
validity
of
his
removal
must
be
judged
by
the
regulations.
i
only
say
that
the
regulations,
the
procedures
prescribed
in
the
regulations
do
not
differ
in
any
material
respect
from
those
that
appear
in
the
statue
itself.
and
secondly
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
here
we
do
not
have
a
procedure
set
up
applicable
to
or
purporting
to
delimit,
the
plenary
removal
authority
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
that
is
my
second
point
and
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan
that
unlike
the
service
case
where
you
had
positive
indication
that
the
secretary
of
state
had
intended
to
circumscribe
his
summary
removal
powers
under
mccarran
rider,
we
don't
have
that
here
in
our
view
and
for
these
--
for
this
--
for
that
additional
reason,
the
validity
of
his
removal
should
not
be
measured
in
terms
of
those
regulations.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
they
did,
procedure
for
removals
we
suggest
under
the
act
of
1950.
that
act,
of
course,
did
not
authorize
his
removal
and
the
procedures
were
promulgated
implementing
they
are
the
same
as
they
are
in
they
are
in
the
statute
in
substance
and
in
effect,
so
that
there
is
really
is
no
difference
and
the
procedures
that
the
statute
prescribes
and
what
is
set
out
in
the
department
of
interior
order
2738.
the
statute
falls,
we
think,
the
regulations
which
are
in
terms
the
same
as
the
statute
necessarily
fall
too.
so
he
was
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
am
concerned
here
mr.
justice
whitaker
with
whether
or
not
his
removal
was
invalid
and
our
position
is
that
the
statute
did
not
authorize
it,
we
concede
that.
the
regulations
are
not
a
proper
basis
for
saying
the
validity
of
that
removal
because
they,
in
our
view,
fall
with
the
statute.
we
defend
this
removal
only
as
an
exercise
of
the
plenary
authority
of
this
department
of
interior
to
remove
this
employee
and
employee
at
will.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
not
in
terms
and
we
say
no
that
they
were
not
intended
in
contrast
to
the
service
v.
dulles
case,
they
were
intended
to
apply
or
to
delimit
the
plenary
authority
upon
which
we
now
rely.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
we
did
and
we
think
moreover
that
we
follow
those
regulations
scrupulously,
that
this
point
of
course
i
am
saying
that
they
are
not
simply
not
a
basis.
later
i
will
explain
why
we
think
that
they
were
complied
with
so
that
there
can
be
no
valid
basis
for
complaint
in
that
respect.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
the
discharge
is
valid
and
lawful.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
that
suggests
that
the
statute
in
our
view
was
not
intended
to
delimit
the
plenary
authority
--
plenary
removal
authority
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
from
the
fact
and
if
we
are
correct
that
the
removal
was
not
invalid
if
necessarily
follows
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
reinstatement
in
his
former
position
that
i
think
is
a
proposition
that
he
is
not
in
dispute
here
so
that
the
real
and
critical
issue
is
whether
or
not
he
was
validly
and
effectively
removed
in
1954.
now
further
bearing
upon
his
right
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no,
because
our
answer
to
that
is
that
the
records
have
been
expunged
of
all
security
risk
matters
and
that
therefore
there
is
no
occasion
as
in
the
peters
case
for
this
court
to
reach
the
more
difficult
constitutional
question.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
been
unable
to
locate
the
original
of
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
of
june
22
and
july
1
of
1954.
mr.
hynning
has
made
available
his
copy
of
the
transcript.
this
copy
contains
certain
marginal
comments
that
we
will,
as
soon
as
practicable,
delete
and
file
with
the
court
at
the
earliest
practicable
movement.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
on
the
subject
of
the
hearing
of
july
--
or
june
22
and
july
1,
i
would
in
fact
advise
the
court
that
the
encyclopedia
britannica
devotes
a
full
page
to
transcendentalism
without
any
reference
to
black
mountain
transcendentalism.
black
mountain
is
a
range
in
the
tribal
area
of
west
pakistan.
i
hope
the
court
won't
press
me
as
to
what
is
meant
by
transcendentalism
but
it
will
accept
my
word
that
it
insofar
as
i
am
concerned
it
does
not
add
a
semblance
or
relevancy
to
the
inquiry
that
was
directed
to
mr.
vitarelli.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
endeavor
to
enquire
--
conform
myself
as
to
how
many
individuals
were
affected
by
the
court's
decision
in
cole
versus
young,
and
with
a
very
rough
approximation
was
some
300
employees.
i
don't
hold
that
out
as
in
any
sense
being
accurate
but
that's
a
rough
approximation
that
i
was
able
to
come
up
with.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
is
the
figure
that
i
was
able
to
come
up
with
now.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
certainly,
i
would
agree
that
that
would
be
quite
--
quite
true.
by
way
of
summation
of
my
remarks
yesterday,
i
would
like
to
say
that
unlike
the
situation
in
service
v.
dulles
and
in
cole
v.
young,
additional
removal
from
federal
employment
did
not
violate
any
procedural
right
conferred
upon
him
by
statute,
or
in
our
view,
by
regulation.
if
however,
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
department
of
interior
are
deemed
applicable
to
a
removal
of
an
at-will
employee,
then
of
course
our
position
is
that
these
--
these
procedural
requirements
were
strictly
complied
with.
the
only
inquiry
we
feel
that
might
be
opened
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
this
hearing
is
to
the
fairness.
and
of
course
the
court
will
have
available
if
it
deems
that
this
is
a
necessary
inquiry
in
the
case
to
have
available
the
full
hearing
and
we
trust
and
hope
that
it
isn't
all
as
bad
as
the
excerpts
of
petitioner's
counsel
have
made
it
out
to
be.
if
we
are
correct
in
our
position
that
there
was
no
invalidity
as
distinguished
from
a
lack
of
authority,
a
statutory
authority
here,
in
petitioner's
removal,
then
as
i
said
yesterday
we
think
it
follows
that
there
is
no
right
to
reinstatement
in
his
former
position.
or
another
reason
we
think
that
there
is
no
present
right
to
that
--
to
reinstatement
because
of
the
personal
action
which
was
taken
in
1956.
i
should
say
that
that
notification
of
petitioner's
termination
bears
the
same
date
as
the
original
notification
and
purports
to
affect
his
termination
as
of
september
10,
1954.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that
that
if
the
1954
termination
be
deemed
invalid,
that
the
1956
notification
would
not
validate
that
removal.
petitioner's
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
position
formerly
occupied
by
petitioner
was
converted
to
the
competitive
service
on
april
1st
of
1956,
in
our
view
and
as
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made
clear
yesterday,
becomes
a
relevance
only
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
reinstatement
of
the
petitioner.
that
would
be
an
emolument
of
his
office
which
presumably
he
would
be
entitled
to,
that
is
to
have
the
high
commissioner
of
the
trust
territory
exercise
his
discretion
and
either
recommending
or
not
recommending
the
petitioner
for
conversion
from
accepted
to
competitive
status.
only
in
that
event,
even
though
that
condition
has
been
satisfied,
would
he
be
within
the
classified
service
so-called
and
eligible
for
the
procedural
protections
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act.
well
petitioner's
main
contention
in
this
court
is
that
he
is
entailed
to
reinstatement
and
in
pursuance
of
that
position,
he
insists
that
only
by
reinstating
him
in
his
position
can
the
badge
of
infamy
which
has
been
fastened
upon
him
by
the
1954
removal
be
rectified.
we
question
whether
that
is
a
necessary
element
of
relief
and
we
point
to
the
case
of
peters
v.
hobby
which,
as
the
court
knows,
was
a
loyalty
case
and
where
a
reinstatement
could
not
in
the
court's
judgment
be
granted
to
the
petitioner
there.
there
of
course
there
was
fixed
10
year
of
employment
that
had
expired
at
the
time
of
decision.
but
we
think
here
that
because
of
the
status
of
this
particular
employee
that
we
have
an
analogous
problem,
in
the
sense
that
he
is
and
was
at
all
times
subject
to
removal
at
will
and
that
to
reinstate
him
in
these
circumstances
would
not
add
anything
in
the
way
of
substantive
relief
that
which
is
already
been
administratively
accorded
to
him.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
of
course
i
think
if
the
court
should
hold
that
he
has
not
been
properly
discharged,
then
restoration
would
be
in
order.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
he
had
not
been
properly
discharged
in
1954
or
1956
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
reinstatement.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
so
from
the
prior
decision
of
this
court
that
it
would
be
necessary
-
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that's
the
only
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
nullification
by
--
by
reason
of
the
--
the
backdating
it
to
the
original
date
of
his
termination.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no
in
our
view
that
is
nevertheless
entailed
to
prospective
application
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct
if
i
understand
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
well
we
could
not
report
by
dating
a
notification
of
personnel
action
two
years
back
that
that
discharge
would
become
effective
as
of
that
time,
but
it
might
well
can
be
suggested,
that
is
the
case
here,
that
it
might
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
that
is
what
we
urge
upon
the
court,
yes.
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
here
should
be
according
to
the
court
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
conversion
is
of
the
position
from
--accepted
status
to
competitive
status.
as
is
clear,
i
think
the
occupant
of
that
position
does
not
automatically
convert
from
an
accepted
status
to
a
competitive
status.
he
must
first
qualify,
second
he
must
have
the
recommendation
of
the
high
commissioner.
now
until
that
--
those
two
conditions
are
satisfied,
the
occupant
of
that
position,
under
civil
service
regulation,
this
is
what
they
call
a
status
quo
employee,
as
such
he
is
subject
to
summary
removal
in
the
same
fashion
that
he
remains
an
employee
at
will.
so
that
--
and
even
--
even
though
he
is
permitted
to
remain
in
that
position,
a
position
in
the
competitive
service,
he
is
nevertheless
subject
to
a
summary
termination.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
he
would
not
be
in
the
competitive
service.
he
would
not
have
to
be
appointed,
if
the
court
please,
there
may
be
a
technical
difference,
but
he
must
be
recommended
by
his
--
the
employing
agency
or
in
this
case
the
high
commissioner
of
the
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
is
right.
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
agency
to
recommend
to
a
civil
service
commission
whether
or
not
an
individual
employee
is
to
be
converted
in
to
the
civil
service.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
is
the
status
of
--
that
would
be
the
status
of
petitioner,
where
he
restored,
and
he
would,
we
think
in
the
event
of
restoration,
be
entitled
to
what
might
be
classified
as
an
employment
benefit
that
is
accrued
during
the
period
of
his
removal.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no.
as
i
understand
it
in
respect
to
the
schedule
a
positions
of
the
department
of
interior,
particularly
the
overseas
positions
here,
i
don't
understand
there
to
be
a
written
examination
required.
these
are
jobs
that
are
not
susceptible
of
written
examination
that's
why
--
it's
the
one
reason
that
they
are
schedule
a
to
begin
with.
the
qualifications
as
i
gather
from
the
civil
service
regulations
are
that
the
employee
have
completed
a
satisfactory
period
of
service.
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
--
that's
right.
it
comes
down
to
that
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
situation
in
this
case
where
he
restored.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
we
will
be
glad
to
do
so.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
we
will
be
glad
to
do
so.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
will
do.
