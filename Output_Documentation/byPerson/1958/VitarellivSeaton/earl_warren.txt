chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hynning,
is
that
correct
pronunciation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
it
been
written
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
objection
from
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
then,
will
you
present
it
then
for
the
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
was
at
the
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
the
government
concedes
that
there
is
no
question
of
loyalty
in
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
laughlin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
laughlin,
to
satisfy
a
curiosity,
would
you
please
tell
us
what
black
mountain
transcendentalism
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
those
that
had
no
civil
service
standing,
would
you
give
them
a
same
treatment
that
you
gave
this
man,
fire
him
immediately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
ask
it
was
because
there
is
an
apparent
to
the
session
here
that
this
man
was
a
loyal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
what
you
say
--
didn't
we
have
the
other
situation
in
the
cases
we
have
been
hearing
today
the
greene
case
and
the
taylor
case,
the
statute
didn't
provide
for
any
procedure,
but
the
set
up
procedure
and
the
question
is
whether
they
should
abide
by
that
procedure,
and
i
got
to
this
agreement
that
they
should.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
you
have
--
didn't
the
regulations
provide
a
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
position
whether
you
did
or
did
not,
did
or
not
follow
the
regulations,
the
discharge
was
lawful?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
101,
william
vincent
vitarelli,
petitioner,
versus
fred
a.
seaton,
et
al.
mr.
laughlin
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
gentlemen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
does
the
300
represent?
i
missed
a
portion
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
assuming
mr.
laughlin
that
he
had
never
been
properly
discharged
and
this
court
so
--
this
court
should
so
find
and
assuming
also
that
secretary
of
the
interior
could
fire
him
without
cause
if
he
was
on
a
payroll,
why
shouldn't
he
be
restored
to
his
position
at
this
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
this
court
should
hold
for
any
reason
he
had
not
been
properly
discharged,
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
reinstatement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
that's
--
that's
the
point
that
i
am
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
laughlin
this
is
rather
technical
question
and
it
wasn't
briefed
by
either
parties,
as
i
understand
that
the
counsel
never
heard
of
it
or
wasn't
in
a
position
to
know
the
existence
of
this
until
last
few
days
and
i
wonder
if
it
wouldn't
be
allowed
for
each
of
you
to
submit
a
memorandum
on
this
--
on
this
subject.
chief
justice
earl
warren
covering
--
covering
that
subject.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
have
it
in
my
mind
(inaudible).
thank
you.
will
you
write
the
first
memorandum
on
it
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
hynning,
you
may
proceed.
