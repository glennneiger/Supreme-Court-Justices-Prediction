mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct.
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
involves
a
former
governmental
employee,
an
educational
employee
of
the
department
of
interior
who
was
removed
in
1954
as
a
security
risk
from
a
position,
which
the
government
concedes,
was
non-insensitive,
this
is,
this
case
doesn't
involve
any
issue
of
secrets
information,
confidential
information
or
anything
of
that
sort.
the
suit
was
instituted
in
the
summer
of
1956.
it
was
heard
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court,
which
granted
the
summary
motion
for
the
government.
then
it
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
affirmed
it.
now
it
is
our
contention
here
that
the
firing
of
this
governmental
employee
from
a
non-sensitive
position
has
a
security
risk
and
under
the
purported
authority
of
a
security
order
in
the
security
act,
it
was
unlawful
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
cole
versus
young.
and
that
he
was
therefore
entitled
to
reinstatement
as
a
result
of
a
fact
that
his
firing
was
unlawful.
now
we
are
asked
--
we
asked
in
the
district
court
for
both
an
order
expunging
the
record
and
declaring
the
firing
to
be
unlawful
and
for
reinstatement.
we
achieved
part
of
that
through
a
so-called
voluntary
expunging
of
the
record.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
firing
was
so
unlawful
that
he
was
entitled
to
--
is
entitled
to
reinstatement.
now
turning
to
the
facts
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
is
correct,
at
the
time
of
his
removal.
now
there
are
certain
changes
that
have
occurred
in
the
personnel
policy
of
the
department
of
interior
that
i
am
going
to
allude
to
later
which
somewhat
modifies
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
it's
necessary
here
to
recall
a
little
bit
of
the
political
atmosphere
of
1954
when
this
security
board
--
when
he
was
suspended
and
when
he
had
his
hearing
before
the
security
board.
this
was
at
a
time
prior
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
peters,
in
service
and
cole
and
there
was
a
common
assumption
within
the
government
that
at
a
security
hearing
there
were
no
legal
problems
or
constitutional
problems.
that
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bailey
against
richardson
which
had
been
affirmed
by
an
equal
division.
now
vitarelli,
as
i
said,
was
a
teacher,
an
educational
employee
of
the
office
of
trust
territories
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
he
was
employed
to
train
native
teachers
out
in
the
caroline
islands.
now
these
caroline
islands
are
islands
being
administered
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
united
nations.
they
were
the
islands
that
were
previously
administered
by
japan
as
mandated
islands
under
the
league
of
nations.
now
this
case
started
initially
with
a
newspaper
interview
with
a
high
commissioner
of
the
trust
territories
of
the
pacific,
and
this
was
printed
in
a
guam
newspaper
of
march
13,
1954
and
it's
been
reproduced
as
pages
1
and
2
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the
headline
here
was
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
security
probe
in
the
trust
isles
and
that
five
employees
were
to
be
ousted
as
bad
risks
or
asked
to
resign.
and
an
example
was
given
of
a
known
conscientious
objector
where
the
high
commissioner
stated
that
an
advocate
of
pacifism
is
out
of
place
and
so
sensitive
and
strategic
in
area
as
the
trust
territories.
i
think
this
is
a
little
ironic
to
find
the
high
commissioner
of
trust
territories
believing
that
pacifist
is
out
of
place
in
some
islands
being
administered
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
world
peace
organization.
a
few
days
later
he
received
a
cable
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
advising
him
that
he
was
being
suspended
without
stating
any
of
the
charges
on
which
he
was
being
suspended.
i
assume
that
this
was
in
the
interest
of
economy,
he
was
going
to
receive
letter
a
little
later
stating
the
charges.
that
came
about
a
week
later
and
it's
been
reproduced
in
the
record
on
pages
3
through
6.
now
these
charges
allege
that
in
the
years
from
1941
to
1945
he
was
either
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
one
sympathetic
association
with
the
communist
party,
with
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
then
he
went
--
they
went
to
list
that
he
was
in
association
with
certain
named
individuals
that
in
1945
he
had
registered
a
preference
for
the
american
labor
party
that
while
an
instructor
at
columbia
university,
he
had
subscribed
to
the
ussr
information
bulletin
and
had
purchased
copies
of
the
daily
worker
and
the
new
masses.
that
in
a
previous
answer
to,
under
the
truman
loyalty
program,
he
had
stated
that
his
association
with
these
named
individuals
were
casual
and
it
was
asserted
that
this
was
not
true,
that
his
associations
were
those
of
an
intimate
friendship.
it
then
went
on
to
allege
that
he
was
therefore
not
reliable
or
trustworthy
in
view
of
these
facts
and
that
he
had
deliberately
misrepresented
falsified
or
admitted
material
facts
or
he
might
be
subject
to
coercion,
influence
or
pressure.
he
was
also
notified
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
the
security
order
and
he
was
supplied
with
a
copy
of
the
executive
order
under
departmental
security
regulations
as
well
as
the
act
of
1950,
the
security
act.
at
that
time,
he
was
given
the
alternative
of
returning
to
washington
at
his
own
expense
from
half
way
around
the
world,
try
to
answer
these
charges
or
if
he
wanted
to
bring
his
family
back
at
government
expense,
he
could
resign.
he
then
tried
to
see
how
he
could
raise
the
funds
to
travel,
but
fortunately
the
government
somehow
or
other
was
induced
to
change
its
mind
and
gave
him
a
travel
request
so
he
could
proceed
to
washington.
at
this
time,
of
course,
he
was
suspended
without
pay.
he
arrived
here
and
prepared
an
answer
together
with
approximately
44
affidavits
principally
from
his
associates
on
the
job
out
in
the
trust
territories.
in
this
answer,
he
denied
any
sympathy
--
membership
in
or
sympathy
with
the
communist
party
or
anyone
who
was
a
communist,
but
he
was
informed
that
his
answer
was
insufficient
and
therefore
a
hearing
was
scheduled.
he
appeared
at
this
hearing
with
counsel
together
with
four
witnesses,
live
witnesses.
the
only
live
witnesses
at
this
hearing
were
the
petitioner
and
his
four
witnesses
in
support
of
him.
one
of
them
was
the
very
distinguished
author
james
michener,
who
wrote
the
tales
of
the
south
pacific
who
had
been
instrumental
for
vitarelli's
employment
in
the
office
of
trust
territories.
as
i
said,
the
government
presented
no
evidence
of
any
kind.
he
was
asked
a
great
variety
of
questions.
now
these,
the
nature
of
these
questions
are
of
the
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
no
sir,
no
sir.
this
case
is
submitted
here
on
what
is
a
somewhat
abbreviated
record
of
only
about
50
pages,
the
record
of
the
--
consist
of
the
pleadings
in
the
district
court
to
which
were
not
attached
the
transcript.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
now
the
questions
that
i
am
referring
to
were
contained
in
certain
allegations
in
the
complaint.
and
since
case
was
disposed
off
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
these
questions
were
--
are
in
the
record
only
to
the
extent
they
are
contained
in
paragraph
26.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
we
have
not
discussed
that
question,
i
have
no
objection
thereto.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
it's
in
type
written
form.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
we
will.
now
in
this
paragraph
26
of
the
complaint
where
we
enumerated
the
kind
of
--
or
endeavored
to
describe
the
kind
of
hearing
that
was
afforded
here
and
show
the
nature
of
questions
asked
of
this
witness.
we
stated
that
he
was
a
--
it
was
inquired
at
first
whether
he
thought
this
was
a
republican
plot
to
get
rid
of
democrats.
what
were
his
views
on
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
the
question
is
did
he
believe
the
security
program
was
a
republican
plot
to
get
ride
of
democrats.
now
the
exact
question,
well
it's
not
in
the
record,
is
reproduced
in
the
margin
of
the
brief
on
page
9,
footnote
3.
the
security
officer
stated,
do
you
think
that
the
security
program
undertaken
by
executive
order
10450
is
politically
inspired
from
the
republican
administration?
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
the
security
officer.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
of
the
hearing?
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
the
date
of
that
question
was
may
or
june
1954.
now
i
think
there
is
an
even
more
extraordinary
exchange
with
respect
to
his
vote
for
the
presidency
in
1948,
in
1940,
which
are
set
forth
verbatim
in
the
brief
on
pages
29
to
30.
they
inquired
whether
he
had
voted
for
mr.
wallace
and
in
the
--
who
was
running
on
the
progressive
ticket
in
1948.
and
he
said
i
voted
for
henry
wallace
once
and
the
chairman
of
the
hearing
board
said
just
one
question
on
that,
did
you
not
vote
for
henry
wallace
when
he
was
a
candidate
for
vice
president?
yes
i
did.
the
chairman
-
then
you
voted
for
him
once
more,
more
than
once?
now
since
the
issue
of
veracity
is
i
believe
one
of
the
crucial
issues
in
this
administrative
hearing,
this
was
one
of
the
means
of
testing
his
candor
and
truthfulness
i
presume.
now
among
the
other
questions
asked
of
him
at
this
hearing
was
what
were
his
views
on
racial
equality.
did
he
believe
there
was
discrimination
against
negros
and
jews?
he
was
asked
questions
on
the
methods
of
pricing
cotton
in
georgia,
whether
he
had
heard
of
consumers
union.
what
was
black
mountain
transcendentalism?
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
haven't
found
anybody
who
knows.[laughter]
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
he
said
he
didn't
know.
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
quite
hap
up
over
the
one
world
idea,
and
whether
he
was
still,
june
1954,
it's
in
parenthesis
by
me,
a
strong
advocate
of
the
united
nations.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
the
security
officer.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
at
the
hearing.
now
these
questions
have
been
--
the
security
officer
at
that
time
was
the
assistant
solicitor
of
the
department
of
interior
mr.
reuel
armstrong,
who
since
became
solicitor,
but
i
believe
has
left
the
government
service.
now
that
was
the
nature
of
the
hearing
that
he
had
and
of
course
the
problem
that
confronted
his
then
counsel
was
what
were
the
issues
in
this
proceeding,
were
this
--
were
they
charges.
they
stated
at
the
hearing
his
loyalty
was
not
in
question,
and
then
they
went
over
this
whole
area
of
political
opinion.
i
might
say
political
partisan
opinion.
now
a
little
later
the
hearing
board
recommended
that
his
retention
in
employment
was
not
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security
and
that
recommendation
was
endorsed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
who
said
that
as
a
result
thereof,
the
employment
of
vitarelli
was
to
be
terminated
for
the
reasons
specifically
set
forth
in
the
letter
of
charges.
now
the
letter
of
charges
i
have
summarized
to
you
and
since
it
was
conceded
at
the
hearing,
that
he
was
entirely
loyal,
it
would
appear
that
by
a
process
of
elimination,
the
question
was
one
of
veracity
that
somehow
or
other
he
was
not
deemed
a
person
who
had
fully
told
the
truth.
now
i
do
not
know
this,
i
don't
know
what
--
why
he
was
terminated.
i
can
only
go
by
the
documents
and
analyze
what
appears
in
the
transcript.
but
i
believe
that
when
you
have
looked
at
several
of
these
transcripts
in
here,
you
find
--
tend
to
find
a
pattern
on
the
part
of
the
security
machinery
that
can
be
described
only
as
an
obsession
with
veracity.
that
is
you
are
charged
with
something
that
isn't
perhaps
too
important,
but
if
you
don't
admitted
and
come
clean
in
someway
other,
we
know
you
are
lying,
we
are
going
to
get
you
on
that.
now
i
think
that
is
the
explanation
of
what
the
hearing
board
did,
but
it's
entirely
a
deduction
or
a
speculation
on
my
part.
all
that
i
can
see
in
the
record
is
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
said
that
his
employment
should
be
terminated
in
the
interest
of
national
security
for
the
reasons
specifically
set
forth
in
the
charges,
and
most
of
those
charges
seem
to
disappear
if
you
assume
that
he
is
perfectly
loyal.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
believe
that's
correct.
it
was
so
stated
twice
on
the
face
of
the
transcript
by
the
security
officer.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
controversy
with
the
government
on
that
point
at
all,
nor
is
there
any
controversy
on
the
nature
of
the
position
he
had.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
as
to
it's
being
non-sensitive,
that
he
was
training
teachers
of
native
children
in
the
caroline
islands
in
the
pacific.
now
the
next
stage,
in
this
proceeding
came
up
along
approximately
a
year
later,
and
if
it
were
to
be
written
up
in
fiction,
it
would
be
challenged
i
assume
by
many
reviewers
on
the
ground
that
it
involves
too
many
coincidences.
but
viterelli's
counsel
was
taking
a
trip
around
the
world,
and
while
he
was
waiting
at
the
airport
out
in
india,
he
ran
into
a
person
who
said
he
was
a
personnel
officer
of
the
officer
of
trust
territories
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
so
his
counsel
introduced
himself
and
said
that
he
had
been
attorney
for
viterelli.
now
the
personnel
officer
said
well
that
was
a
case
that
should
have
been
handled
differently.
now
this
is
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
viterelli
should
--
wasn't
a
person
of
doubtful
loyalty
of
security,
he
just
didn't
have
common
sense,
because
he
associated
with
the
natives.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
with
the
natives.
out
in
the
--
he
was
supposed
to
train
native
teachers
in
the
caroline
islands,
but
he
permitted
his
children
to
associate
with
native
children
and
this
reflected
a
lack
of
common
sense.
well
his
counsel
represented
these
facts
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
on
the
occasion
of
the
personnel
officer's
return
to
the
united
states,
a
supplemental
hearing
was
held
in
which
all
of
this
was
testified
to
under
oath
by
the
personnel
officer.
so
at
this
second
hearing,
viterelli
did
have
a
witness
on
behalf
of
the
government
come
in
and
more
or
less
confirm
what
his
counsel
had
represented
had
transpired
there
at
that
airport
in
india.
well
this
was
the
posture
of
the
situation,
of
the
case,
the
time
this
court
decided
cole
versus
young.
whereupon
a
demand
was
made
on
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
immediate
reinstatement
on
the
ground
that
he
held
a
non-sensitive
position.
when
that
demand
was
not
complied
with,
the
suit
went
into
the
district
court.
now
at
that
time,
the
government
came
up
with
the
defense
that
in
as
much
as
viterelli
had
held
a
position
called
schedule
a,
that
is
one
of
the
scheduled
accepted
from
the
competitive
civil
service
under
the
lloyd-la
follette
act.
he
could
be
fired
for
no
reason
at
all
and
therefore
he
had
no
right
to
--
right
of
reinstatement.
at
that
point,
we
served
a
notice
for
the
taking
of
depositions
on
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
respondent
members
of
civil
service
commission
to
inquire
of
why
they
insisted
on
firing
him
with
a
badge
of
infamy
as
a
security
reason
when
he
could
have
been
fired
for
no
reason
at
all,
without
any
infamy,
without
damage
to
his
profession
and
career.
the
government
opposed
this
discovery
on
the
ground
that
these
questions
were
hypothetical
and
immaterial.
i
am
now
reading
from
page
11
of
the
brief,
“the
only
relevant
legal
issue
herein
is
whether
the
procedures
in
fact
employed
by
the
defendant's
secretary
in
accomplishing
plaintiff's
discharged
were
legal
and
valid.
neither
the
existence
of
any
other
procedure
which
could
have
been
used
to
discharge
plaintiff,
nor
the
reason
why
it
was
not
in
fact
employed
can
have
any
possible
relevance
therein.”
noting
this
as
a
concession
of
record,
we
abandoned
the
effort
of
discovery.
now
the
district
judge,
the
--
the
next
step
then
was
the
voluntary
expunging
of
the
record
by
respondents.
they
stated
that
a
new
personnel
form
had
been
issued
which
struck
from
it
all
references
to
the
executive
order
into
the
act
of
1950.
and
stated
that
that
was
the
maximum
relief
to
which
this
petitioner
was
entitled.
now
the
district
judge
felt
that
since
vitarelli
was
not
in
the
competitive
civil
service
and
was
therefore
an
employee
at
will,
he
could
not
order
him
reinstated
since
the
government
--
since
the
employing
department
could
turn
around
that
same
day
and
fire
him
for
no
reason
at
all.
now
in
the
court
of
appeals
we
argued
the
constitutional
issue
that
the
--
while
vitarelli
could
have
been
dismissed
as
an
employee
at
will,
he
was
not
so
dismissed,
he
was
dismissed
as
a
security
risk
under
a
legal
authority
which
was
not
applicable
thereto.
now
the
manner
of
his
dismissal
was
defamatory.
it
started
with
a
newspaper
conference
on
guam
and
it
went
on
from
there.
it
defamed
him
in
his
right
to
follow
his
calling
as
a
teacher.
now
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
a
modicum
or
a
minimum
of
constitutional
rights
available
to
an
employee
such
as
vitarelli.
he
had
a
right
to
be
free
from
dismissal
on
unconstitutional
or
flagrantly
arbitrary
grounds.
but
that
no
such
dismissal
had
occurred
here,
but
the
treatment
was
not
arbitrary
and
was
consistent
with
due
process
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
has
charges,
there
was
the
paraphernalia
of
a
hearing
and
review.
furthermore
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
even
these
things
aside,
there
was
a
clear
basis
for
the
executive
to
have
fired
vitarelli
on
the
ground
that
he
was
untrustworthy.
and
they
recited
here
at
this
paragraph
of
the
letter
of
charges
which
said
that
he
was
untrustworthy
or
alleged
that
he
was
untrustworthy.
the
court
of
appeals
further
held
that
he
had
gotten
the
maximum
relief
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
under
any
circumstances
namely
an
expunging
of
the
record.
now
this
expunging
of
the
record
is
a
rather
interesting
thing
in
this
case,
the
government
recited
that
they
have
expunged
all
references
to
any
adverse
findings
made
with
respect
to
vitarelli
under
the
security
order.
so
that
means
that
the
letters
making
a
finding
that
his
removal
was
required
by
the
interest
of
national
security,
that's
out,
and
for
the
reason
specifically
set
forth
in
letter
of
charges,
he
look
--
he
must
then
look
at
the
letter
of
charges
to
see
what
remains
after
the
expunging
takes
place.
now
the
subject
matter
is
suspension
under
the
executive
order,
that's
out.
next
paragraph
says
by
authority
of
the
executive
order
you
are
suspended,
so
that's
out.
the
next
paragraph,
number
two
says
a
specific
--
a
specific
of
security
interest
permits
your
charge
as
follows,
so
that's
out,
that's
under
the
executive
order.
then
you
get
down
to
paragraph
number
three
which
says
your
behavior
et
cetera
show
you
to
be
unreliable
in
the
light
of
the
facts
above
alleged
that's
out,
because
it
refers
obviously
to
the
facts
above
alleged.
moreover
the
language
of
numbered
paragraph
3
is
paradigm
from
the
criteria
for
security
dismissal
under
the
executive
order.
now
in
the
next
paragraph
number
four,
there
is
your
advice
of
your
rights
to
have
a
hearing
under
the
executive
order.
so
that's
out.
the
last
paragraph
says
you
get
a
copy
of
the
executive
order,
well
that's
out.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
am
reading
from
the
record
pages
3
through
6.
now
that
follows
therefore
that
this
document
which
furnishes
a
clear
basis
for
the
secretary's
action
after
being
expunged
reads
to
vitarelli
from
the
secretary
of
interior
signed
douglas
mckay.
i
think
that's
all
that
remains
under
that
expunging.
now
the
basic
contention
that
remains
here
i
think
is
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
an
employee
such
as
vitarelli
are
coterminous
with
the
rights
given
to
him
by
congress
and
if
congress
has
given
him
no
rights,
he
has
no
constitutional
rights.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
is
one
--
no
–
now
i
think
at
this
point
i
should
take
up
the
change
in
the
personnel
policy
that's
occurred
in
the
department
of
the
interior,
and
in
doing
that
i
want
to
apologize
for
bringing
it
up
at
this
late
stage.
but
neither
counsel
for
the
government
nor
i
knew
about
this
until
after
the
final
brief
had
been
filed
in
this
case
just
a
few
days
ago.
and
it
took
a
little
clarity
now
to
find,
but
at
the
time
of
vitarelli's
dismissal
in
1954
all
the
overseas
positions
of
educational
employees
at
the
department
of
interior
were
in
schedule
a.
but
then
in
1956,
the
president
authorized
a
gradual
blanketing
in
of
overseas
positions
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
acting
entirely
within
the
department
of
the
interior
blanketed
in
all
these
education
positions
as
of
april
1,
1956
before
this
lawsuit
was
started.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
into
the
competitive
civil
service.
now
under
and
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
the
dismissal
was
made
effective
september
10,
1954.
he
was
suspended
in
april
1954.
the
change
in
the
personnel
practices
of
the
department
of
interior
were
made
effective
on
april
1,
1956.
now
under
this
blanketing
in
procedure
it
was
necessary
for
an
employee
to
meet
two
tests.
he
had
to
pass
what
was
equivalent
to
an
--
passing
an
unassembled
civil
service
examination
that
is
he
was
qualified
by
training
and
experience.
and
secondly
he
had
to
have
the
recommendation
of
the
high
commissioner.
now
it
is
our
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
then
he
became
a
regular
civil
servant
that
is
a
civil
servant
in
the
competitive
civil
service
and
entitled
to
the
statutory
protections
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
this
was
done
in
the
department
of
interior
as
of
april
1,
1956.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
he
satisfies
the
first
condition,
the
second
condition
involves
the
act
of
the
high
commissioner
of
the
trust
territories,
an
official
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
now
with
respect
to
that
i
think
that
the
court
must
assume
that
in
exercising
that
discretion
the
high
commissioner
is
going
to
act
in
an
honorable
and
responsible
manner
and
to
the
mere
fact
that
vitarelli
is
a
litigant
in
this
case
is
not
going
to
leave
the
high
commissioner
to
refuse
to
make
such
a
recommendation.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
he
has
not
been
covered
in
because
he
has
been
off
the
government
role
since
1954.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well
that
raises
the
question
whether
the
position
or
the
employee
is
in.
now
if
--
if
he
were
to
be
reinstated
on
the
ground
that
his
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
is
true.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
--
yes,
but
i
think
it
also
follows
that
at
the
time
of
the
order
of
reinstatement
that
the
position
to
which
he
would
reinstated
under
the
present
personnel
situation
of
the
department
of
the
interior,
he
would
be
ordered
reinstatement
to
a
position
which
is
in
the
competitive
civil
service.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct.
now
this
is
one
of
the
rights
that
he
stands
to
lose
that
is
to
compete
for
being
blanketed
in
unless
he
secures
an
order
of
reinstatement,
so
that
at
issue
here
are
two
things.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
he
doesn't
need
the
test
of
eligibility
unless
he
becomes
an
employee
of
the
department
of
interior
again.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
is
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well
i
said
the
examination
here
is
an
unassembled
examination,
that
is
based
on
training
and
experience
not
a
written
examination.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
is
correct.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
oh,
i
certainly
agree
i
am
not
here
contending
that
he
is
now
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act.
i
am
contending
however
that
these
attempted
personnel
actions
taken
in
october
1956
by
which
he
was
purportedly
dismissed
without
any
reason
at
all,
since
they
related
to
a
position
which
had
been
blanketed
in
under
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
necessarily
did
not
meet
the
statutory
test
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
and
therefore
those
personnel
actions
were
invalid.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
don't
quite
follow
your
honor
when
you
say
those
restrictions.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well
then
he
has
--
then
he
has
no
cause
whatever.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
he
is
not
at
the
present
time
protected,
that's
granted.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
am
saying
that
this
suit
involves
two
things,
it
involves
a
claim
for
reinstatement
as
well
a
claim
for
back
pay.
of
course,
the
claim
for
back
pay
isn't
properly
before
this
court
on
certiorari
from
the
district
court.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
is
correct.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well
he
was
not
--
he
was
not
fired
for
no
reason
at
all
here.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
he
could
have
been,
he
could
have
been.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well,
i
am
not
certain
if
the
answer
is
necessarily
yes
to
the
last
question.
he
would
have
to
be
fired
from
a
position
and
if
that
position
is
covered
by
the
civil
service
standards,
then
there
is
a
question
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
is
not
properly
at
stake
this
particular
lawsuit.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
am
stating
that
he
--
if
his
dismissal
as
the
security
risk
in
1954
is
unlawful,
as
we
were
contending,
then
he
is
entitled
to
reinstatement
to
the
situation
he
had
at
that
time.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well
he
had
--
and
then
he
would
be
entitled
it
seems
to
me
as
one
of
the
rights
of
reinstatement
to
compete
for
securing
a
competitive
civil
service
status
under
the
blanketing
and
process.
that
would
be
my
answer
to
the
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well,
i
believe
the
government
concedes
that
they
cannot
discharge
a
man
because
they
don't
like
the
color
of
his
hair,
that
that
is
the
kind
of
the
thing
which
even
a
person
outside
the
civil
service
is
protected
for
under
the
constitution.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
they
maybe
silent
on
the
subject.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
and
it's
the
fact
that
they
were
not
silent
here,
but
they
said
he
is
a
security
risk
and
they
discharged
him
in
a
defamatory
manner.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct.
now
it's
our
contention
that
--
therefore
that
his
dismissal
in
--
in
1954
was
unlawful
under
the
authority
under
which
it
purported
to
be
made.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
secondly
that
it
was
done
in
such
a
defamatory
manner
and
a
gratuitously
defamatory
manner,
that
is
the
executive
here
has
the
power
to
discharge
him
for
no
reason,
but
it
insisted
as
it
were
on
imposing
a
badge
of
infamy
on
him.
well
that's
violated
his
constitutional
rights,
so
that
there
he
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
would
be
void,
now
if
that's
void
then
he
is
entitled
to
reinstatement.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
so
conceded
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
would
concede
here
today,
but
for
the
intervening
change
of
the
general
personnel
policy
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
think,
if
as
a
result
of
reinstatement
he
then
becomes
eligible
to
compete
for
recognition
of
that
right.
now
i
certainly
would
go
on
to
concede
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
denial
of
that
right
to
him
after
his
reinstatement
is
one
that
can
be
litigated.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
now
the
government
says
here
that
his
constitutional
right,
as
i
said,
is
coterminous
with
a
statutory
right.
now
i
believe
that
is
not
true,
that
is
i
believe
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
here
not
to
have
been
defamed
gratuitously.
secondly,
we
have
contended
that
it
is
no
justification
in
any
court
exercising
the
judicial
power
to
justify
an
act
on
the
basis
of
what
could
have
been
done,
but
wasn't
done.
and
it
doesn't,
it
seems
to
me,
help
the
government
one
iota
to
come
in
here
and
say,
we
could
have
fired
vitarelli
for
no
reason
if
in
fact
you
gave
the
wrong
reason.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct.
now
i
think
they
are
also
stuck
with
the
position
they
took
on
the
discovery
motion,
that
is
they
at
that
point
presented
to
the
lower
court
that
this
firing
of
him
for
no
reason
at
all
was
legally
irrelevant.
now
they
prevented
discovery
and
i
think
they
are
bound
by
that
position
having
taken
it
in
the
lower
court.
now
our
next
contention
is
that
his
firing
under
the
departmental
security
regulations
violated
the
regulations
whereby
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
provided
for
the
security
risk
dismissals.
now
the
government
here
seems
to
challenge
this
court's
ruling
in
service,
by
saying
it
seems
anomalous,
that
the
head
of
a
department
would
limit
its
authority.
well
of
course,
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
held
in
service
that
there
the
secretary
of
state
had
limited
its
authority
--
his
authority
under
the
mccarran
rider.
so
that
i
think
that
these
regulations
are
binding
on
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
i
believe
they
are
violated,
although
the
proof
of
their
violation
is
to
be
presented
in
terms,
which
sounds
like
the
constitutional
arguments.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well
the
question
then
you
see
is
what
was
the
illegal
effect
of
these
papers
in
1956.
now
there
were
two
papers
there,
one
was
an
expunging
of
the
record.
they
said
the
record
is
expunged
and
he
is
now
fired
for
no
reason,
and
that
presents
the
question,
two
questions
really,
can
you
fire
the
man
without
rehiring
him,
that
is
can
you
fire
the
man
in
(voice
overlap)
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well
that
of
course
was
the
not
theory
of
the
government
in
presenting
those
documents,
because
on
the
face
on
the
document
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well
i
think
it
--
my
argument
certainly
is
that
the
firing
in
1954
was
invalid.
now
i
am
also
contending
that
these
attempted
firing,
this
attempted
firing
in
1956
is
equally
invalid,
on
the
ground
by
that
time
--
and
this
brings
me
back
to
the
discussion
i
had
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
by
that
time
the
position
which
vitarelli
would
have
had,
but
for
the
intervention
of
his
unlawful
firing
was
in
the
competitive
service
--
civil
service
and
therefore
subject
to
the
lloyd-la
follette
act,
and
that
these
56
documents
on
their
face
do
not
comply
with
the
lloyd-la
follette
act.
so
our
contention
is
the
56
firing
fails.
and
that
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
believe
that's
correct.
now
in
by
way
of
concluding,
let
me
state
why
i
believe
reinstatement
is
necessary
in
addition
to
the
--
in
addition
to
the
reason
already
given.
this
man
has
suffered
a
gratuitous
defamation.
it's
perhaps
somewhat
unique
in
the
security
annals
that
you
start
out
by
telling
the
press
you're
going
to
remove
a
man
as
a
security
risk
before
you
give
him
charges
or
have
a
hearing.
now
where
a
defamation
occurs
in
--
normally
there
are
two
things
that
happen
one
is
the
retraction
and
the
other
are
the
--
are
the
payment
of
damages.
now
the
government
has
contented
here
in
the
brief
in
the
greene
case,
they
haven't
consented
to
be
sued
in
tort
for
damages.
but
they
haven't
made
a
retraction,
what
they
have
done
here
is
to
expunge
the
record
but
they
haven't
rectified
the
error,
by
saying
we
were
wrong.
they
haven't
reemployed
the
man.
now
that
is
the
test
of
the
man
in
the
street
in
the
security
case,
when
is
it
shown
that
a
security
case
is
wrong
the
government
takes
him
back.
and
i
submit
that
that
kind
of
retraction
means
reinstatement.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
yes
let
me
–
yes,
i
will
come
to
those
right
now.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
the
regulations,
on
their
face,
state
that
they
apply
to
any
removal
of
any
employee
on
security
grounds
with
the
exception
of
temporary
employees.
they
then
go
on
to
say
that,
in
such
a
case,
where
they
--
where
an
employee
is
being
removed
on
security
ground,
he
is
entitled
to
a
written
statement
of
charges,
and
i
am
now
reading
from
the
regulation,
“as
specific
and
detailed
as
security
considerations
permit.”
now
we
come
to
the
charges
to
see
whether
it
meets
that
test.
the
charges,
in
view
of
the
concession
that
is
loyalty
was
not
in
issue,
gets
down
to
a
charge
of
veracity,
and
that
charge
of
veracity
is
that
he
had
stated
that
his
associations
with
three
named
individuals
were
not
casual,
but
were
on
the
contrary
associations
of
an
intimate
friendship.
now
i
submit
that
you
test
whether
or
not
a
charge
is
specific
by
trying
to
determine
whether
you
can
answer
the
charge
on
the
assumption
of
innocence.
of
course,
if
you
assume
the
man
is
guilty
there
isn't
any
point
of
this
inquiry.
but
if
the
assumption
of
innocence
is
applicable,
then
a
charge
that
the
man
has
said
his
relationship
was
casual,
how
can
he
answer
that
in
terms
of
something
that
didn't
occur.
i
mean
if
--
if
his
sole
association
was
casual,
that's
all
it
is,
how
can
he
answer
something
more
that
it
was
one
of
intimate
friendship
without
telling
him
times,
places
and
so
on.
we
submit
that
that
weighting
of
the
charge
doesn't
meet
the
test
of
specificity.
it's
i
think
entirely
subject
to
the
criticism
of
this
court
in
simmons
against
the
united
states
of
a
game
of
blind
man's
bluff.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
correct.
now
the
second
thing
he
is
entitled
to
a
fair
hearing.
well,
i
think
this
hearing
is
one
of
the
strangest
hearings
i
have
ever
examined,
and
i
believe
that
the
questions
asked
of
a
partisan
nature
clearly
demonstrate
that.
now
the
preceding
counsel
had
dealt
very
exhaustibly
with
the
issue
of
confrontation
and
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
time
on
that
than
is
necessary
other
than
i
think
to
say,
here
is
the
case
that
requires
no
balancing
of
interest.
there
is
no
question
here
of
government
secrets,
there
is
no
question
of
a
sensitive
job.
the
man
is
concededly
loyal,
what
was
there
in
this
case
that
required
the
secret
importance.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
on
the
56
personnel
document.
as
i
--
as
the
record
show,
there
were
three
documents
filed.
there
was
an
affidavit
--
this
appears
on
the
record
starting
on
page
32.
there
was
an
affidavit
by
the
personnel
officer
of
the
office
of
territories
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
and
it
stated
that
this
affidavit
accompanied
the
defendant's
opposition
to
plaintiff's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
the
posture
there
taken
by
the
department
of
justice
was
that
this
was
a
expunging
of
the
record.
now
the
affidavit
states
that
the
attached
form
50,
which
is
the
document
on
page
33,
is
a
true
copy
of
the
official
document
reflecting
the
termination
of
vitarelli
from
a
position
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
office
of
trust
territories,
and
that
is
all
the
affidavit
states.
now
the
notification
of
personnel
action
that's
on
page
33
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
documents
entitled
notification
of
personnel
action
on
page
31
except
for
two
particulars.
it
omits
a
sentence
and
it
adds
a
sentence.
the
sentence
that
it
omits
is
the
sentence
that
appears
at
the
top
of
page
32,
the
5th
line,
“this
action
is
being
taken
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
executive
order
10450.”
that
sentence
does
not
appear
in
the
new
56
form
50.
the
second
change
is
the
addition
of
a
sentence
appearing
on
the
top
of
page
34,
“this
form
50
is
a
revision
of
and
replaces
the
original
bearing
the
same
date.”
in
all
other
respects
the
two
documents
are
identical.
now
that
means
that
there
are
two
dates
on
each
document,
a
date
appearing
after
line
number
four,
which
in
normal
personnel
practice
reflects
the
date
on
which
the
document
is
prepared.
in
both
instances
that
date
is
9/21/54.
the
effective
date
is
line
number
six,
and
that's
date
9/10/54.
now
i
submit
that
at
the
time,
this
document
was
prepared
under
the
department
of
the
interior,
sometime
in
october
1956,
it
was
--
it
purported
to
be
an
expunging
of
the
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
earlier
document
had
been
taken
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
executive
order
10450
and
was
nothing
else.
it
was
not
in
my
opinion
a
re-firing
of
the
individual.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
--
that
appears
and
it
says,
this
action
is
subject
to
all
applicable
laws,
rules
and
regulations
and
maybe
subject
to
investigation
of
--
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
i
assume
this
is
jargon
that
appears
sort
of
a
savings
clause
on
all
personnel
forms.
i
am
not
attributing
any
significance
to
it
that
--
that
this
means
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
possibly
it
could
be
contented
that
it
meant
this
was
subject
to
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
but
i
don't
think
that
could
follow.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
now
one
of
the
difficulties
here,
this
was
reset
in
type,
in
the
court
below
we
had
a
photostat
and
there
we
could
see
whether
this
was
printed
or
type
written,
at
the
moment
i
don't
know
whether
this
was
something
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
as
far
as
our
view
of
the
case
is
concerned,
no.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
assuming
--
this
may
not
answer
your
question
directly,
but
assuming
that
in
1954
vitarelli
had
been
summarily
removed
without
any
reference
to
security
status
whatever.
as
of
that
time
he
would
have
had
no
administrative
rights
of
appeal
or
review
by
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
in
1956
we
have
two
changes
in
circumstances.
one
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
document
coming
two
years
after
he
is
off
--
out
of
service.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well,
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
question
to
the
answer
i
am
going
to
try
to
make
in
the
written
brief
because
i
have
not
determined
to
what
extent
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
having
on
april
1
decided
that
all
the
positions,
educational
positions
in
the
office
of
trust
territories
were
to
be
put
in
the
competitive
civil
service.
whether
he
could
take
this
long
a
time,
that
is
from
april
1
to
let
us
say
october
15
or
october
1,
to
make
up
his
mind.
now
perhaps
he
could
in
which
case
the
answer
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
right
to
review.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
believe
the
department
of
justice
is
relying
on
a
statute.
they
are
relying
on
the
inherent
power
of
the
executive
to
dismiss
an
executive
employee
unless
that
employee
has
some
rights
either
under
a
statute
or
under
the
constitution.
and
of
course
the
rights
under
the
constitution
are
deemed
to
be
limited
to
matters
of
things
that
are
clearly
irrational
or
that
involve
matters
of
partisan
politics.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
can
speculate
as
i
have
i
think
it's
jargon.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well,
i
think
you
are
trying
to
subject
some
of
the
personnel
forms
of
the
government
to
a
logical
reasonable
analysis
and
that
can't
be
done
sometimes.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
at
least
that's
my
personal
opinion.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
want
to
be
fair
here
to
the
departments
of
justice.
i
suppose
they
would
say
--
it's
stating
that
it
is
subject
to
the
applicable
law,
its
weasel
language.
if
the
law
isn't
applicable,
it
isn't
subject
to
that.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
said
we
have
to
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well,
you
persuaded
me
i
should
withdraw
my
earlier
answer
and
give
a
little
more
reflection
to
this
in
the
memorandum
i
shall
submit.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that's
more
within
the
knowledge
of
the
respondent
than
it
is
mine.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
well,
i
--
i
don't
like
to
ask
a
question
--
which
answers
a
question
which
speaks
in
terms
of
labeling
or
an
error
or
error
in
citation.
this
--
this
was
a
very
substantive
wrong
done
to
vitarelli.
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
things
in
this
--
in
the
brief
i
have
criticized
the
court
of
appeals
very
strongly
on,
saying
this
is
an
error
in
labeling.
i
don't
think
it
has
any
--
in
my
view
the
1956
document
means
nothing
more
than
they
have
endeavored
partially
to
comply
with
our
request
for
an
expunging
of
the
record
and
that
alone,
and
i
believe
it
was
on
that
basis
this
document
was
submitted
to
the
district
court
and
used
by
respondents
there.
now
i
think
this
perhaps
is
further
supported
by
the
third
document
that
was
submitted
in
1956
and
that's
the
document
on
page
34,
which
is
an
affidavit
from
the
civil
service
commission,
which
says
that
all
records
of
the
commission
have
been
expunged
of
all
adverse
findings
made
with
respect
to
vitarelli
under
executive
order
10450.
now
mr.
hall
(ph)
could
not
make
that
statement
if
he
did
not
have
a
new
form
50,
which
had
deleted
from
it
the
reference
to
the
executive
order
10450.
and
it
would
appear
to
me
that
this
third
document
clinches
my
arguments
that
all
that
was
attempted,
intended,
or
actually
done
in
the
1956
document
was
an
expunging
and
nothing
more
and
that
could
not
be
taken
to
have
the
effects
of
a
1956
firing.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
that
is
our
position.
now
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
technical
observation
on
the
statute
there
has
been
a
suggestion
here
that
the
1950
act
or
the
act
of
august
26,
1950
does
not
apply
to
persons
outside
the
competitive
civil
service.
i
think
that
is
easily
answered
by
the
text
of
the
act
itself,
which
is
printed
in
the
government's
brief,
page
28.
and
if
you
look
there,
after
the
first
italicized
proviso,
that
any
employee
having
a
permanent
or
indefinite
appointment,
now
an
indefinite
appointment
means
the
person
who
has
an
appointment
outside
the
competitive
civil
service.
and
while
there
may
have
ben
some
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
they
wanted
additional
powers,
nonetheless
the
face
of
the
statute
shows
that
it
had
application
to
people
in
the
--
who
were
not
in
the
competitive
civil
service
so
long
as
their
position
had
some
rational
relationship
with
the
national
security.
i
have
just
apparently
one
or
two
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
urge
this
court
to
overrule
bailey
against
richardson.
i
believe
the
premisses
under
which
that
case
was
affirmed
without
an
opinion
by
this
court
have
been
completely
rejected
in
subsequent
decisions
in
peters,
in
service,
in
cole.
and
i
believe
that
much
of
a
difficultly
in
lower
courts
comes
from
the
facts
that
the
lengthy
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
bailey
case
still
has
a
certain
degree
of
standing
which
i
believe
it
should
not
have
and
does
not
have
under
peters,
cole,
and
service
and
--
but
that
is
a
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
an
equal
division,
that
is
correct
but
that
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
--
i
say
--
i
think
the
principle
of
bailey
is
wrong
and
the
fact
that
it
is
wrong
i
think
is
demonstrated
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
peters,
cole
and
service.
now
bailey
essentially
held
that
the
a
governmental
employees
has
no
constitutional
right.
he
is
a
policeman
--
he
has
the
privilege
no
one
has
the
constitutional
right
to
be
policeman
kind
of
argument.
i
believe
that
has
been
rejected
by
this
court,
but
the
language
appears
to
have
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
stand
corrected.
well,
now
--
my
language
was
certainly
subject
to
your
criticism.
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
because
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
governments
briefs
rely
on
bailey
against
richardson,
that
they
have
persuaded
district
court
that
that's
good
law,
and
they
persuade
--
mr.
clifford
j.
hynning
i
believe
that
if
this
court
decides
vitarelli
versus
seaton
in
the
favor
of
petitioner,
that
will
be
made
even
clear.
thank
you.
