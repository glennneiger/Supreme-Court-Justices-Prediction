justice
john
m.
harlan
the
records
of
the
procedure
are
on
file
in
this
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
read
all
of
that
and
i
couldn't
find
in
the
record,
i
couldn't
find
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me
mr.
hynning,
but
i
suppose
vitarelli
has
stated
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
saying
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
are
claiming
there
is
more
than
--
that
there
is
not
only
money
at
stake
here
namely
his
salary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
understand
that,
but
that's
the
consequence
or
might
be
the
consequence
if
we
reverse
this
case.
you
are
saying
in
addition
to
that
he
has
sort
of
a
mandatory
right
to
take
his
civil
service
examination,
don't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
an
examination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
step
without
reason,
that's
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
step
without
reason,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
procedure
under
which
he
was
fired
was
adequate
for
the
reason
for
the
ground
on
which
they
purported
to
fire
him,
namely
as
a
security,
that's
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
â€“
are
you
going
to
deal
at
all
with
the
respects
in
which
you
claim
that
the
regulations
that
were
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
why
i
raised
the
question
about
the
record,
the
proceedings
that
you
may
have
a
bearing
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
secretary's
regulations
that
you
are
referring
to?
justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn't
they
govern?
justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn't
they
govern
dismissal
on
security
grounds?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
regulations,
if
we
accept
your
view
the
regulations
don't
apply,
then
you
are
faced
with
a
constitutional
question
if
there
is
one
or
two
as
to
whether
what
was
done
is
constitutionally
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
1956
discharge
on
its
face
did
not
reported
his
charging
at
that
time,
it
reported
his
charging
nunc
pro
tunc?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
your
point
about
the
document
on
33,
which
is
the
1956
notification
of
personnel
action,
you
say
that
has
no
greater
effect
than
there
had
been
a
letter
stuck
in
the
file
saying
that
there
was
typographical
error
on
the
original
personnel
action
and
that's
hereby
corrected.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
another
words
what
you
say
is
that
if
the
1954
firing
is
no
good,
the
man
has
never
been
fired.
