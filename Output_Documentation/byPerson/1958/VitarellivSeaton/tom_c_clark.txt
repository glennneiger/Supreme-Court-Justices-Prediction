c.

what
was
that
first
question?
justice
tom
c.
clark
who
asked
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
was
the
date?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
date
of
that
question.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
is
it
by
the
way?[laughter]
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
he
know?
justice
tom
c.
clark
associated
with
what?
justice
tom
c.
clark
united
states
civil
service
has
power
to
investigate
and
set
aside
or
refuse
to
affirm
summary
dismissals
that
as
explained
the
(inaudible)
of
summary
dismissals
(inaudible)?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
about
1956?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
am
not
talking
about
--
suppose
this
is
just
a
1956
document,
all
he
would
(inaudible)
1956
but
no
prior
history
that
the
head
of
the
department
(inaudible).
could
he
have
done
it
without
asking
the
civil
service
and
having
it
approved?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
the
only
statute
on
which
they
rely
for
the
right
to
dismiss
summarily
for
any
cause
they
see
there.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
if
the
head
of
the
department
does
have
such
inherent
power,
what
was
the
reason
in
1956
for
adding
the
statement
about
the
rules
and
regulations?
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
that's
what
they
are
depending
on,
why
did
they
add
this
in
1956?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
should
say
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
(inaudible)
but
i
should
think
that
they
have
a
summary
right
to
dismiss.
and
we
assume
that
the
secretary
of
interior
has
a
summary
right
to
dismiss
and
that's
what
they're
basing
it
on.
there
will
be
no
other
reason
for
them
to
put
in
something
about
the
civil
service
supervision.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
maybe
it's
legal
language
but
its
language
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
would
construe
in
connection
with
determining
whether
they
dismissed
him
summarily
at
that
time
as
of
that
date
on
so-called
inherent
power
subject
to
no
man's
supervision.
