mr.
morton
hollander
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wouldn't
--
the
outset
--
i
tried
to
straighten
out
this
question
of,
through
rate
versus
the
aggregate
of
intermediate
rates.
mr.
benson
is
absolutely
correct
in
suggesting
that
the
so-called
applicable
rate
in
this
controversy
is
the
through
rate,
even
though
it
exceeds
by
almost
100%,
the
combination
of
intermediate
rates.
this
is,
by
virtue,
of
an
i.c.c.
regulation
which
mr.
justice
douglas
adverted
to
as
appearing
at
the
top
of
page
11
of
the
record.
that
doesn't
mean,
however
--
and
this
is
--
this
is
the
--
i
think
a
very
important
distinction
to
--
to
bear
in
mind
simply
because
a
rate
is
called,
applicable
in
i.c.c.
parlance,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
that's
the
reasonable
rate
or
the
just
rate
or
the
one
which
is
allowed
by
law.
in
fact,
the
i.c.c.
in
a
consistent
series
of
decisions
dating
back
to
the
very
enactment
of
the
motor
carriers
act,
part
ii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
which
we
are
here
concerned,
has
always
held
--
has
always
held
that
wherever
a
shipper
can
show
that
an
aggregate
of
intermediates
is
less
than
the
through
rate,
the
through
rate
is
prima
facie
unreasonable.
and
of
course,
that's
the
question
we
want
to
get
over
to
the
commission
in
this
case.
we
want
to
give
the
carrier
an
opportunity
in
this
case
to
rebut
that
prima
facie
unreasonableness.
mr.
morton
hollander
we
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
that's
it,
precisely.
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor.
we
suggest
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
so,
your
honor.
we're
--
we
simply
suggest
that
we
are
--
mr.
morton
hollander
that's
all
we
asked
for.
mr.
morton
hollander
that's
all
we
asked
for
in
the
court
below.
and
that's
--
and
that's
all
the
court
below
gave
us,
and
that's
the
only
reason
we're
here
defending
this
lawsuit.
now,
we
want
the
same
permission
accorded
by
this
court,
namely,
to
have
the
opportunity
to
challenge
the
through
rate,
in
this
case,
on
the
ground
that
it's
unreasonable.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
both
cases
--
mr.
morton
hollander
in
this
particular
case,
although
the
record
is
ambiguous,
the
original
payment
in
t.
i.
m.
e.
was
based
on
the
lower
rate.
that
is
the
combination
of
the
intermediates
which
comes
up
to
about
$6
per
a
hundredweight
as
opposed
to
the
$10
per
hundredweight,
prescribed
by
the
through
rate.
and
time
as
suing
goes
here,
for
the
difference,
in
effect
between,
a
$6
and
$10,
but
it
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
issue
is
precisely
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
why
--
why
does
the
government
take
out
the
aggregate
of
the
intermediates?
because
it's
the
government's
position
which
has
not
as
yet
been
sustained
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
but
we
think
we
will
be
able
to
sustain
our
position
before
the
commission,
if
allowed
to
go
there,
that
the
true
rate
is
unreasonable
in
the
situation
of
this
sort
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
the
combination
of
the
intermediates.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
not
that
we
can
recover,
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
but
at
least
that
i
--
i
think
that
points
up
what
is
really
and
necessarily
petitioners
--
both
petitioners'
underlying
assumption
in
this
case.
they
necessarily
contend
that
our
federal
district
court
at
the
behest
of
a
carrier
like
t.
i.
m.
e.
or
davidson,
must
--
they
--
they
contend
that
the
district
court
must
enforce
the
exaction
from
any
shipper
of
any
filed
rate
irrespective
of
how
wild
that
file
rate
is.
irrespective
of
how
unjust
it
is,
irrespective
of
how
unreasonable
it
is
and
irrespective
of
the
extent
to
which
it
is
specifically
condemned
by
congress
in
the
motor
carriers
act
as
being
unlawful
and
prohibited.
that
is
necessarily,
i
say,
their
underlying
assumption
in
this
case.
mr.
morton
hollander
because
otherwise,
they
would
have
to
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
to
the
extent
that
it
was
possible,
administratively
for
us,
to
file
a
protest,
we
did.
and
this
--
this
actually
is
highlighted
by
the
first
of
the
2
cases
argued
here
today.
in
the
davidson
case,
the
carrier
did
impose
a
surcharge,
filed
a
surcharge
rate.
we
thought
it
was
unreasonable.
within
7
days,
after
the
surcharge
was
filed,
we
protested
and
as
mr.
reyes
pointed
out,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
at
that
point,
placed
our
complaint
and
not
about
the
shippers
on
their
investigation
and
suspension
docket.
we
did
follow
and
we
did
exhort
--
mr.
morton
hollander
it
had
the
effect
of
suspending
it
for
a
period
of
7
months.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
termination
of
that
seven-month
period,
may
of
1952,
the
suspension
was
lifted,
the
surcharge
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
this
was
in
accord
with
the
statutory
mandate
limiting
the
suspension
period
--
mr.
morton
hollander
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
from
may
1952
when
the
suspension
was
ended
until
october
of
1953
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
finally
invalidated
and
set
aside
as
unjust,
unreasonable,
and
contrary
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
this
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i'm
confident
that
it
was
not
in
this
case
possible
to
do
that.
the
t.
i.
m.
e.,
like
i'm
sure
in
other
cases,
may
not
be
quite
as
great
and
still
others
it
maybe
considerably
more
maybe
as
much
as
four
or
five
years.
mr.
morton
hollander
our
basic
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
it
came
into
existence
with
the
motor
carrier
act
of
--
of
1935.
it
may
have
initially
been
five
months
and
extended
to
seven
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
probably
still
is
and
the
number
of
instances
possible
for
the
commission
to
make
such
a
determination
prior
to
the
elapse
of
the
suspension
period,
the
important
question
i
think
before
this
court
in
the
davidson
case
however,
is
whether
or
not
during
the
period
of
time
between
the
suspension
--
between
the
lifting
of
the
suspension,
that
is
may
1952
and
the
effective
date
of
the
commission's
order
invalidating
the
surcharge
about
a
year
and
a
quarter
later,
is
unjust
and
unreasonable,
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not,
similar
surcharge
is
collected
by
the
carrier
during
that
period
of
time
maybe
retained
by
the
carrier
even
though
we're
ready
to
go
to
the
commission
and
show
that
the
very
reasons
which
motivated
the
commission
to
find
the
rate
unjust
and
unreasonable
in
october
1953
applied
with
full
force
to
the
period
preceding
that
invalidation.
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
really
don't
know
in
the
situation
of
that
sort,
whether
or
not,
it's
--
it's
really
feasible.
in
the
--
in
the
t.
i.
m.
e.
situation,
the
government
does
not
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
i
assume
it
always
has
been,
but
the
time
situation
raises
a
different
problem
in
this
sense
that
a
rate
--
a
filed
rate,
unlike
the
through
rate
filed
by
t.
i.
m.
e.,
maybe
fully
effective
and
perhaps
even
lawful
and
reasonable
in
certain
situations.
however,
in
its
application,
it
may
turn
out
to
be
unreasonable
as
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
of
the
--
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
--
that's
really
our
position
here.
and,
of
course,
there
would've
been
no
reason
for
the
government
to
come
in
at
the
time,
t.
i.
m.
e.
initially
filed
a
joint
rate
and
protest
that
joint
rate
on
the
grounds
of
unreasonableness
when
the
particular
problem,
with
respect
to
the
unreasonableness
of
application
of
the
joint
rate,
did
not
materialize
or
perhaps
until
three
to
four
years
later.
so
--
mr.
morton
hollander
we
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
are
willing
to
assume
here
that
our
rights
are
no
greater
than
that
of
a
private
shipper.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
prior
to
the
lifting
of
the
suspension.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
closely
analogizes
in
davidson
and
it
closely
analogizes
the
government's
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
were
speaking
about
the
davidson
thing.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
--
i
am
suggesting
that.
well,
that's
precisely
what
happened
in
davidson.
we
did
pay
the
higher
rate.
we
did
not
in
time,
but
we
did.
in
davidson,
we
did
pay
the
higher
rate
just
like
the
private
shipper.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
that,
of
course,
is
--
is
our
position
that
he
--
mr.
morton
hollander
he
could
not
get
it.
he
--
mr.
morton
hollander
we
--
no.
we
--
we
do
not
argue
that
he
could
get
it
before
the
commission.
we
do
argue
that
the
path
is
clear
for
him
to
get
it
in
court
just
as
we
think
the
path
is
cleared
to
the
government
to
get
it
in
court.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
it
lacks
authority
in
a
motor
carrier
case
to
award
monetary
reparations.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
would
like
--
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
montana,
but
before
i
do,
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
few
minutes
of
the
court's
time
to
review.
i
think
the
two
principles
which
to
my
mind
are
--
are
the
guiding
principles
in
a
litigation
of
this
sort
and
which
again
to
my
mind,
point
with
sureness
to
the
conclusion
that
both
courts
below,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
properly
referred
our
reasonableness
defense
or
ordered
the
district
court
to
refer
the
reasonableness
defense
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
first
--
mr.
morton
hollander
proceedings
we
are
ready
to
concede
before
this
court
at
this
time
the
correctness
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
--
i
--
i
should
say
view
settled
since
1939,
when
they
first
had
occasions
to
consider
it,
that
is
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
takes
the
position
that
in
the
motor
carrier
case,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
disclaims
that
it
has
power
to
award
monetary
reparations
to
a
shipper.
it
--
it
takes
that
position
--
this
--
this
court
hasn't
passed
on
their
question.
to
my
knowledge,
no
court
has
passed
on
that
question,
but
that
is
the
view
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
we're
ready
to
accept
it
for
the
purposes
--
mr.
morton
hollander
but
--
mr.
morton
hollander
that
--
mr.
morton
hollander
that
statement,
your
honor,
accurately
represents
the
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
commission's
view,
there's
no
question.
mr.
morton
hollander
which
we
are
not
challenging
in
this
case
--
mr.
morton
hollander
that's
right.
however,
i
should
like
to
point
out,
your
honor,
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
at
the
same
time
that
it
had
been
disclaiming
jurisdiction
to
award
monetary
reparations
in
favor
of
a
shipper
who
claims
that
unreasonable
charges
have
been
exacted
from
him
by
the
motor
carrier,
at
the
same
time
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
this
again
is
their
settled
view
for
over
20
years,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
steadfastly
adhered
to
the
proposition
that
if
such
a
shipper
goes
into
court
and
files
his
action
for
reparations
in
court
and
the
court
stays
the
action
so
filed,
in
order
to
afford
the
interstate
commerce
commission
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
rate
so
charged
were
in
fact
unreasonable,
the
commission
as
i
say
has
consistently
ruled
that
it
will
on
reference
of
such
a
case
from
a
court
make
the
determination
in
aid
of
the
court
and
pass
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
was
any
unreasonable
--
any
unreasonable
exaction
involved.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
even
though
the
commission
disclaims
jurisdiction
itself
to
award
monetary
reparations,
it
paves
the
way
for
the
court
to
make
such
an
award.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor
the
bell
potato
chip,
its
predecessor
decision
stating
back
to
1939
and
the
recent
davidson
case,
another
davidson
case
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
only
this
year
in
302
i.c.c.,
where
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
commission
has
stated
that
it
will
--
it
always
stands
ready
--
it
always
stands
ready
with
respect
to
allegations
on
the
part
of
a
shipper
that
in
the
past,
unreasonable
charges
have
been
exacted
from
them
by
a
motor
carrier.
it
always
stands
ready
to
act
in
aid
of
a
court
in
which
an
action
for
monetary
reparations
has
been
filed.
now,
we
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
its
--
mr.
morton
hollander
its
view
is
that
congress
--
its
view
is
that
congress
denied
it
the
power
to
make
monetary
reparations
award,
but
it
definitely
is
not
its
view
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
not
the
courts,
but
that
the
commission
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
the
commission
can
then
on
referral
from
the
court
fully
explore
the
question
of
allegedly
unreasonable
rates
and
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
those
rates
in
the
past
were
in
fact
unreasonable
and
if
it
so
certifies
to
the
court
then,
of
course,
the
court
is
in
a
position
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
to
award
monetary
damage.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
in
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
it
would
--
it
was
--
it
was
precisely
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
i
remember
correctly,
the
commission
in
bell
relied
heavily
on
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
on
--
on
el
dorado.
mr.
morton
hollander
in
my
own
view,
of
course,
is
that
it
did
but
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
in
my
own
view
is
that
it
should
have.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
it
is
--
it
is
my
fond
hope
that
perhaps
the
court
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
is
presently
constituted,
need
not
overrule
it,
but
at
least
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
i
think,
this
court
could
if
--
if
it
wanted
to
retain
--
if
it
wanted
to
retain
some
vestiges
of
montana-dakota
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
your
honor.
not
on
the
basis
of
that
distinction.
the
--
the
only
quarrel
we
have
with
montana-dakota,
the
only
quarrel
we
have
with
montana-dakota
--
now,
there
was
--
there
was
a
lot
of
common
ground
between
majority
in
dissent,
i
think,
in
montana-dakota.
they
came
to
a
parting
of
the
ways
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
i
think
the
only
part
of
montana-dakota
which
is
adverse
to
the
government's
decision
here
represents
that
part
of
montana-dakota
which
the
majority
and
minority
came
to
a
parting
of
the
ways.
that
is
the
minority
felt,
i
think,
correctly
that
this
question
of
reasonableness
would
certainly,
could
not
passed
upon
by
the
court,
should
have
been
referred
to
the
only
expert
body.
mr.
morton
hollander
but
it
wasn't.
the
majority
felt
that
it
shouldn't
have
been.
mr.
morton
hollander
that's
the
--
that's
the
only
aspect
of
montana-dakota,
we
would
be
interested
in
having
overruled
here.
mr.
morton
hollander
oh
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
and,
of
course,
it
would
be
necessary
for
us
to
sustain
that
position,
if
we
were
here
as
plaintiffs
seeking
recovery
of
allegedly
unreasonable
charges
exacted
from
us
by
the
motor
carrier.
our
position
here,
i
must
point
at,
is
a
little
different.
it's
exactly
the
position
we
were
in
when
we
were
before
this
court
in
western
pacific.
and
that
--
and
that
is
--
is
this.
in
western
pacific,
just
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
but
in
western
pacific,
we
were
confronted
with
the
situation
or
even
though
we
were
under
part
i
--
even
though
we
were
under
part
i,
we
were
precluded
from
going
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
asking
the
interstate
commerce
commission
from
reparations.
mr.
morton
hollander
well
i
--
i
--
mr.
morton
hollander
not
--
not,
your
honor,
so
far
as
the
motor
carriers
are
concerned.
no.
mr.
morton
hollander
there's
the
same
gap,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
commission
had
in
mind
there
is
that
once
they
determine
that
a
certain
rate
is
applicable,
it
is
the
so-called
legal
rate.
it's
this
sacrosanct
published
filed
legal
effective
rate,
you
have
to
pay
it
or
otherwise
you're
violating
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
--
i
realize
that,
your
honor.
i
suppose
(inaudible)
to
so
characterize
that
however
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
where
the
--
a
petitioner's
entire
argument
is
one
in
which
he
wraps
himself
around
the
file,
the
legal
and
applicable
rate,
and
blinds
himself,
not
only
blinds
himself,
but
insists
that
all
of
the
courts
be
blinded
to
the
fact
that
--
that
so-called
applicable
legal
effective
file
published
rate
is,
in
fact,
unjust.
it's
excessively
unreasonable.
it's
condemned
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
he
wraps
himself
around
montana
--
the
extent
that
montana-dakota
relies
on
this
concept
of
the
filed
rate
being
the
effective
and
--
and
chargeable
rate.
i
think
in
this
--
in
--
in
this
litigation
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
--
i
am
trying
to
disassociate
myself,
i
can
assure
you
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
--
i
think,
in
this
case,
i
have
paramount
consideration
which
i
would
like
to
advert
to
is
the
fact
that
every
--
every
basic
preset
of
jurisprudence
every
concept
of
fair-dealing
or
fairness
in
litigation
will
--
will
allow
a
shipper
from
whom
a
motor
carrier
seeks
to
exact
a
--
a
charge
the
shipper
claims,
is
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
in
contravention
of
the
law.
i
think
every
--
every
concept
of
fairness
and
litigation
will
allow
the
shipper
an
opportunity
to
try
to
--
at
least,
to
try
to
establish
his
defense.
mr.
morton
hollander
it
did
not
certainly
with
respect
to
the
part
of
the
case
i'm
interested
in
--
in
montana-dakota.
i
think
it
did
--
i
think
it
did
find
--
mr.
morton
hollander
it
was
rejected
and
yet
--
and
yet
just
two
years
ago
in
the
western
pacific
case,
i
think
all
of
these
considerations
were
really
at
the
nub
of
that
decision.
because
the
western
pacific
case
involved
precisely
the
situation
i've
tried
to
point
that
is
now
before
the
court,
thereto,
carriers
claimed
certain
funds
from
the
government.
the
government
resisted
on
the
ground
that
the
charges
the
carriers
were
demanding
where
excessive
and
unreasonable.
the
court
of
claims
before
whom
the
litigation
had
been
instituted
by
the
rail
carriers
in
that
case,
threw
up
its
hands,
it
said,
"well,
government
defends
on
unreasonableness,
unreasonableness
is
a
problem
we
can't
cope
with.
that
ever
since
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
a
problem
which
necessarily
must
be
adjudicated
by
the
central
body,
by
the
great
agency
having
the
expertise,
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission."
so
the
court
of
claims
said,
“we
can't
pass
on
that
problem
of
unreasonableness.”
well,
then,
we
said,
“well
if
you
can't
pass
on
it,
will
you
please
refer
the
matter
over
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
so
that
we
will
be
able
to
have
an
opportunity
over
there
to
establish
our
defensive
unreasonableness.”
the
court
of
claims
felt
too,
that
that
request
had
to
be
denied.
and
the
reason
for
it
is
precisely
the
reason.
the
referral
was
denied
in
--
in
montana-dakota,
by
the
majority.
and
is
precisely
the
reason
that
the
carriers
here
insist
that
referral
is
improvident,
namely,
in
the
court
of
claims,
it
was
ruled
that
there
could
be
no
referral
by
the
court
of
claims
of
this
question
of
this
defensive
unreasonableness
in
interstate
commerce
commission,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
government
was
precluded
from
filing
an
independent
reparation
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
in
that
case,
the
reason
that
the
government
was
precluded,
the
court
said,
was
because
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
and
destroyed
the
government's
right
to
go
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
independent
reparation
proceeding.
well,
when
this
court
took
the
case,
this
court,
in
reversing
the
court
of
claims,
went
to
pains
to
point
out
that
the
fact
that
the
government
could
not
file
independent
reparation
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
completely
immaterial.
here,
the
government
was
asking
for
--
of
opportunity
for
adjudication
of
the
defensive
unreasonableness,
a
defense
which
ever
since
the
passage
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
respect
to
rail
carriers
in
1887
with
respect
to
motor
carries
since
1935,
necessarily,
must
be
aired
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
this
court
directed,
in
reversing,
it
directed
the
court
of
claims
to
afford
us
an
opportunity
to
air
that
defense
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
don't
see
that
that's
really
any
different,
your
honors,
from
a
situation
where
a
plaintiff
and
a
(inaudible)
comes
into
court
and
he
says,
“well
look,
the
defendant
has
been
negligent
and
i
want
damages.”
and
the
court
saying,
"well
--
the
defendant
saying
at
that
point,
“well,
but
look,
you've
been
contributory
negligent.
you're
not
on
top
of
any
recovery
under
the
law.”
and
the
plaintiff
to
put
him
in
a
position
comparable
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
a
hypothetical
situation
i'm
giving,
would
say
well,
the
court
has
no
power
to
pass
on
this
question
of
contributory
negligence.
it
must
enter
judgment
forthwith
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
on
the
basis
of
the
plaintiff's
assertions
that
defendant
was
negligent.
that's
precisely
what
they're
asking
you
to
do
here,
your
honors.
therefore
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
it
--
it
was
to
a
certain
extent.
but
not
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
section
322
is
--
is
involved
in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor.
petitioners
in
this
case
or
--
or
petitioner
davidson,
at
least,
has
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
raised
a
section
322
question.
but
the
effect
of
section
322
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh
yes,
the
motor
carriers.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
but
it's
been
changed.
it
was
--
it
was
changed
actually
this
past
summer.
so
that
probably
in
a
situation
of
this
sort,
we
will
be
exactly
occupying
the
position
of
a
private
shipper.
the
general
accounting
office,
since
august
of
1958,
has
in
effect,
been
stripped
of
its
power
to
effect
a
unilateral
adjustment
or
recruitment
of
a
charge
with
respect
to
a
charge
which
the
general
accounting
office
says
is
excessively
unreasonable
and
unjust.
the
power
to
effect
the
deductions
is
limited
under
this
new
statute
to
those
situations
where
the
government
can
establish
that
there
was
in
fact
an
overcharge
that
is
a
charge
in
excess
of
the
applicable
filed
legal
rate.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
in
--
in
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
and
--
if
the
commission
outlines
the
procedure
for
the
shipper
to
follow
in
the
bell
litigation
and
as
i
say
it's
--
that's
the
view
the
commissioners
has
passed
ever
since
--
for
about
20
years
now.
they
tell
the
shipper
this.
they
say,
“well
we
can't
give
you
the
money
for
passed
exactions
of
unreasonable
rights.
however,
you
go
to
court.
you
file
your
suit
in
court.
tell
the
court
to
hold
the
action
in
abeyance.
mr.
morton
hollander
we'll
consider
the
question
--
on
referral,
we'll
consider
the
question
and
then
the
court
will
go
ahead
and
which
i
think
is
a
sensible
and
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
--
i
think,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
entertain
his
application
and
in
view
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
self
disclaimer
of
jurisdiction
to
award
money
reparations,
the
intertsate
commerce
commission
will
entertain
the
application,
but
in
the
maximum
relief
he
would
get,
would
be
in
adjudication
from
the
commission
that
these
past
rates
are
unreasonable.
and
they
would
then
dismiss
his
complaint.
and
then
he
would
be
able,
i
think,
to
take
advantage
of
that
adjudication
of
past
unreasonableness
on
the
part
of
--
from
the
commission
and
if
he
wanted
to
go
to
court.
and
i
think
so
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
that
too
is
clearly
within
the
contemplation
of
the
--
of
the
bell
line
of
cases.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
these
i.c.c.
decisions
make
it
crystal
clear
that
the
commission
contemplates
that
the
court
will
proceed.
not
the
commission,
but
that
the
court
will
proceed
to
actually
give
the
shipper
a
monetary
judgment
for
the
past
unreasonable
charges.
mr.
morton
hollander
and
that,
of
course,
is
--
is
bottomed
on
the
provisions
of
the
act
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
as
well
as
the
shipper's
traditional
common-law
remedy
against
--
mr.
morton
hollander
in
which
pursuant
to
a
commission
order,
a
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
we
have
a
long
footnote
on
page
34
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
of
our
brief
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
in
which
--
in
which
we
set
forth
that
10
of
15
interstate
commerce
commission
decisions
in
question
--
in
cases,
which
were
presented
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
the
bell
theory,
that
is
the
shipper
recognizing
that
the
commission
could
not
award
him
monetary
reparations
directly,
invoked
the
aid
of
the
commission
in
order
to
get
from
the
commission
a
determination
that
the
rates
charged
by
the
carrier
to
the
shipper
were,
in
fact,
excessively
unreasonable
and
unlawful.
i
do
not
know
the
subsequent
history
of
each
of
these
interstate
commerce
commission
cases,
but
i
--
i
feel
safe
in
--
in
assuming
that
the
shipper
filed
these
proceedings
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
getting
an
adjudication
of
past
unreasonableness
not
as
an
empty
ritual,
not
to
get
some
certification
from
the
commission
that
he
was
in
fact
overcharged,
but
to
use
it
as
a
basis
for
presenting
it
to
the
carrier
and
tell
the
carrier,
“well
now
look,
the
commission
has
already
decided
this
question.
i
want
you
to
pay
or
i'm
going
to
go
to
court.”
mr.
morton
hollander
and
there
would
be
no
other
purpose
for
him
to
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
we
--
these
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
these
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
these
cases
--
these
cases,
i
feel,
constitute
authority
for
our
position.
the
only
two
cases,
lower
court
cases
in
the
courts
in
which
the
question
has
been
presented
has
been
the
court
of
claims
case
in
new
york
&
new
brunswick
case
also
cited
in
the
same
footnote
on
page
34
and
the
garner
case,
the
district
court
case.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
well
that
--
i
think
that,
your
honor
--
that
is
before
the
commission
pending
a
lawsuit
with
respect
to
other
transportation
services
not
involved
in
the
litigation,
not
before
this
court.
mr.
morton
hollander
not
before
this
court.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
sir.
i
should
have
--
in
response
to
chief
justice's
question,
i
should
have
also
cited
that
davidson
case
because
as
your
honor
suggests,
that
that's
precisely
the
situation,
there
had
been
a
tucker
act
too
filed
in
the
district
court
by
davidson
in
that
case.
and
the
district
court
--
i'm
sorry,
under
the
tucker
act,
there
had
been
a
tucker
act
too
filed
in
the
district
court
by
davidson
in
that
case
for
other
transportation
services.
the
government
contended
that
the
charges
sought
were
unreasonable.
the
matter
was
referred
over
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
as
the
opinion
shows,
agreed
with
the
government's
contention
that
the
charges
were
in
fact
unreasonable.
and
having
exhausted
--
having
exhausted
the
authority
itself,
it
deems
itself
to
have,
the
commission
entered
the
order
discontinuing
the
proceeding.
now,
that
--
that
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
--
and
that
of
course
is
--
mr.
morton
hollander
really
the
other
hurdle
petitioners
are
forced
to
--
to
jump
over
in
this
litigation.
their
position
here
is,
i
think,
mr.
rea
stated
in
his
many
words
--
that
their
position
here
is
that
--
that
common-law
right
was
necessarily
destroyed
by
enactment
of
the
motor
carriers
act.
and
nothing
--
nothing
really
could
be
farther
from
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
motor
carriers
act
which
in
term
saves
all
existing
remedies.section
216
(j)
saves
those
remedies.
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
but
i
think
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
prior
to
the
motor
carrier
act,
i
think
is
this
--
mr.
morton
hollander
that's
right.
and
--
and
the
common
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
--
i
do
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
i'm
not
--
at
least,
i
hope
that
i'm
not
suggesting
that
because
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
that
that's
unquestionably
correct.
there's
--
there's
no
other
way
which
would
make
sense
of
reading
the
expressed
provision
in
the
act
which
saves
the
--
the
common-law
remedy.
what
--
what
happened
--
what
happened
actually
was
this.
there
--
there
certainly
was
this
traditional
sanction
common-law
remedy,
a
shipper
always
could
resort
to
when
he
claimed
that
a
carrier
was
trying
to
exact
an
unreasonable
rate.
now,
in
the
motor
carrier
act
certainly,
congress
decided
that
any
determination
of
unreasonableness
could
not
be
made
by
the
courts
spread
throughout
the
country.
in
the
interest
of
achieving
uniformity
of
regulation,
it
was
absolutely
essential
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
be
vested
exclusively
with
the
primary
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
the
(inaudible)
there's
an
unreasonable
rate.
well,
obviously,
the
fact
that
it's
now
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rather
than
a
court,
which
makes
that
determination
of
unreasonableness
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
itself
is
deprived
of
its
power
to
enforce.
the
very
plain
mandate
of
the
motor
carrier
act
that
every
carrier
shall
charge
just
enough
unreasonable
rates
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
feel
that
if
some
of
the
considerations
we're
stressing
here
necessarily
apply
to
the
montana-dakota
situation,
it
perhaps
maybe
right
for
the
court
to
reconsider
montana-dakota.
actually
--
it
--
actually,
the
only
reason
this
litigation
is
before
this
court
--
the
only
litigation
--
the
only
reason
this
litigation
is
before
this
court
is
because
of
that
outstanding
5
to
4
decision
of
montana-dakota.
carriers
would
have
absolutely
nothing
to
rest
on
in
this
case
if
they
did
not
have
montana-dakota
to
argue
from.
they're
not
interested
in
the
mandate
of
the
statute
which
says
that
unjust
and
unreasonable
rates
are
prohibited
or
condemned
by
an
act
of
congress.
they're
not
interested
in
the
procedures
set
up
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
recruitment
of
any
of
these
unjust
and
unreasonable
rates,
their
sole
argument
in
their
brief
and
as
i
understood
their
argument
today
and
orally
before
this
court,
it
started
out
with
montana-dakota
and
it
wound
up
with
montana-dakota.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
haven't
pointed
that
at,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
and
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
that
may
simply
reflect
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
must
--
i
must
respectfully
point
that
your
honor
that
it
--
it
may
simply
admit
of
an
inference
that
congress
thinks
the
power
is
already
there.
mr.
morton
hollander
but
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
there
may
be
situations,
i
don't
know
if
factually
it
was
true
in
montana
or
of
any
in
these
other
cases.
mr.
morton
hollander
there
may
--
there
maybe
situations
in
which
in
montana-dakota
result
is
perhaps
inescapable.
there
may
be
situations
where
congress
makes
it
absolutely
plain
that
deregulatory
body
shall
not
be
empowered
to
either
award
monetary
reparations
and
congress
may
also
make
it
very
explicit
that
the
regulatory
body
shall
also
be
stripped
of
its
power
to
act
in
aid
of
a
court
in
simply
making
a
determination
of
past
unreasonableness
without
making
the
reparations
award
itself.
but
our
petitioners
are
unable
to
and,
of
course,
it's
impossible
to
point
to
any
such
explicit
language
within
the
framework
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
all
of
the
language
goes
the
other
way.
all
of
the
language
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
reveals
a
consistent
and
insistent
congressional
pattern
to
have
the
carrier
charge,
a
rate
which
is
only
just
and
reasonable
and
no
more.
now
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
your
honor,
that
question,
that
case
was
booted
up
out
before
this
court
in
brief
and
before
argument,
almost
as
heavily
as
it
is
here.
the
briefs
rely
very
heavily
on
it
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
the
court,
i
think,
because
it
really
attacks
a
little
weight
to
the
decision,
did
not
even
bother
to
refer
to
it
in
its
opinion.
but
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
of
course,
that
basic
distinction
between
montana-dakota
and
western
pacific
obtains
here
fully.
we
--
we're
exactly
in
the
same
situation
here
your
honor,
because
this
is
not
a
court
of
claims,
tucker
act
suit
it's
true.
this
suit
by
the
carriers
is
a
suit
filed
under
the
same
statute
in
the
district
court.
and
hereto,
we
claim
that
we're
entitled
to
get
a
district
court
referral
to
the
commission
of
the
question
of
unreasonableness
of
the
rates
which
the
carrier
seeks
to
exact
from
us.
mr.
morton
hollander
well
that
of
course
was
western
pacific's
contention
before
this
court
based
on
montana-dakota.
they
claim
that
we
could
not
go
before
the
commission
because
the
statutory
period
of
limitations
had
expired.
and
i
think
this
court
pointed
out
quite
properly
that
that
made
no
difference
and
i
don't
think
it
should
make
any
here.
mr.
morton
hollander
in
western
pacific?
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
we
distinguished
it
on
--
on
the
basis
of
the
same
--
the
same
grounds
we
suggest
in
our
brief
in
this
case.
namely
that
in
--
in
this
case,
there's
abundant
federal
jurisdiction
is
a
full-fledged
federal
cause
of
action
the
court
can
take
cognizance
of
and
namely
a
suite
by
a
carrier
against
the
united
states
to
recover
monetary
damages
under
the
tucker
act.
that's
true
in
this
case.
it
has
to
be
true
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
have
to
argue
that
it's
true
in
this
case
because
otherwise
they're
out
of
court.
they
have
to
come
into
court,
but
have
to
invoke
the
court's
jurisdiction.
they
have
to
say
that
they
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states.
now
in
montana-dakota,
the
court
found
as
one
of
the
chief
prospered
decision
that
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
any
federally
cognizable
cause
of
action
in
the
district
court.
and
it
linked
that
absence
of
jurisdiction
of
over
--
over
any
federal
cause
of
action
with
the
commission
absence
of
jurisdiction
over
the
question
of
reasonable
of
some
past
rates
as
a
basis
for
its
opinion.
but
both
of
those
factors
coexisted
in
montana-dakota.
there
was
no
federal
cause
of
action.
the
court
was
ready
to
recognize
and
there
was
no
power
in
the
commission.
in
this
case,
very
plainly,
we
do
have
a
--
a
federal
cause
of
action.
i
think
this
also
varies
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
it's
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
do
so
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
i
try
to
point
that
--
that
the
court
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
the
court
can
distinguish
it.
i
think
the
court
can
distinguish
it
on
that
ground.
i
think
it
can
distinguish
it
on
another
very
important
ground
and
namely,
that
is
this.
that
in
montana-dakota,
the
federal
power
act
did
not
purport
in
any
way
to
say
that
any
existing
common-law
rights,
now
here
our
statute
does,
no
--
no
problem
at
all.
congress
employed
terminology,
i
think,
regardless
of
what
maybe
said
of
the
rest
of
the
act,
this
particular
section
uses
language
which
is
not
capable
of
misconstruction
or
misinterpretation.
it
says
very
plainly
that
the
existing
right
shall
be
preserved.
now,
we
have
that
in
this
act,
so
we
have
an
expressed
preservation
of
whatever
common-law
right
the
shipper
had
against
the
exaction
of
unreasonable
rates.
there
was
no
such
expressed
savings
clause
in
the
electric
power
act.
in
addition,
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
power
act
which
i
think
convinced
this
court
in
montana-dakota
was
the
legislative
history
which
supported
the
commission's
view
that
congress
never
intended
to
afford
reparations
authority
to
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
morton
hollander
in
--
under
the
motor
carrier
act?
the
--
the
right
--
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
i
think
the
right
of
a
shipper
to
come
into
court
and
tell
the
court
that
the
carrier
has
exactly
the
rates
which
are
excessive
and
unreasonable.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
no,
your
honor.
here
the
problem
is
eliminated
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
even
though
you
rely
on
the
common-law
right,
you
necessarily
have
to
have
the
extent
of
that
common-law
right
defined
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
court
itself,
we
recognize
as
a
result
of
the
passage
of
the
motor
carriers
act
is
not
allowed
doing
--
embark
into
or
to
engage
in
any
interpretation
of
reasonableness
of
rates,
the
court
must
stay
its
hand
and
refer
the
question
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
by
virtue
of
such
a
referral,
you
achieve
the
very
uniformity
in
regulation
which
i'm
certain
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
motor
carriers
act.
mr.
morton
hollander
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
that
--
that,
i
think,
is
--
it's
certainly
is,
i
think,
but
that
is
what
i
think
we
have
here.
i
think
we
have
a
cause
of
action
outside
of
the
commission.
mr.
morton
hollander
we
have
a
suit
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
and
i'm
--
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
cause
of
action
is
not
destroyed
as
petitioners
contended
is,
simply
because
the
court
is
not
empowered
to
pass
on
the
question
of
reasonableness.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
i
assume
that
that
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
ordinarily
the
commission
determination
in
a
situation
of
this
sort
will
be
framed
along
these
lines
that
the
charge
is
unreasonable
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
so
much.
now,
for
example,
we
hope
if
we're
allowed
to
go
before
the
commission
on
the
--
in
the
t.
i.
m.
e.
case
to
show
that
the
joint
rate
is
unreasonable
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
a
combination
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
and
then
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
judgment
which
is
--
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
in
this
case
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
in
this
case,
for
example,
we
paid
6.5,
judgment
would
be
entered
for
7.5
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morton
hollander
whatever
the
difference
is
between
the
paid
rate
and
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
on
that
phase
of
the
case,
it
certainly
does.
but
it
may
have
preliminary
and
threshold
questions
to
cope
with
and
as
it
does
in
any
suit,
for
example,
against
the
united
states
under
the
tucker
act.
it
may
have
serious
limitation
questions
to
--
to
cope
with
which
it
would
necessarily
consider
wholly
independently.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
am
--
frankly,
i'm
not
ready
to
take
a
position
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
rate
determined
by
the
commission
where
--
to
the
extent
to
which
the
courts
are
foreclosed
from
judicial
review
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
of
the
--
of
the
rate.
i
think
that
question
probably
will
be
up
here
in
about
two
years.
i
also
would
like
to
--
to
point
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
even
under
--
even
under
part
i,
where
there
is
--
even
under
part
i
where
there
is
the
commissioner
agrees
explicit
reparations
authority
that
is
in
favor
of
the
shipper
against
the
rail
carrier
--
even
such
an
award
by
the
commission
is
--
is
only
a
prima
facie
award
and
subject,
of
course,
to
--
to
review
in
the
courts.
mr.
morton
hollander
in
--
in
effect,
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
that's
the
role
the
--
the
commission
occupies
you
and
it
necessarily
has
to
assume
the
role
because
there
is
no
other
master
or
referee
for
the
courts
to
turn
to.
they
--
they
have
to
turn
to
this
--
to
this
one
body
which
does
have
the
expertise
on
this
question.
and
i
think
it's
all
together
sensible
and
reasonable
for
the
courts
to
do
it,
because
in
that
way,
you're
effectuating
the
purpose
of
the
motor
carrier
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
i'm
not
quite
sure
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
commission's
decision
is
necessarily
binding
on
the
referral
court.
i
think
that
question
is
--
is
pending
now
in
--
in
other
litigation.
i
do
think
that
the
minimum
relief
we're
entitled
to
though,
is
to
get
this
commission's
determination
and
then
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
parties
both
will
be
willing
to
fully
abide
by
the
commission's
resolution
of
the
question
and
that,
of
course,
will
--
will
put
an
end
to
the
controversy.
how
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
a
--
the
--
the
courts,
of
course,
as
your
--
as
your
honor
knows,
have,
at
all
times,
reviewed
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
and
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
they're
ready
to
substitute
their
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
administrative
agency,
they
go
over
the
administrative
record,
they
determine
whether
it's
an
arbitrary
decision.
mr.
morton
hollander
find
out
where
there
was
any
substantial
basis
in
it.
and
to
that,
that
was
the
only
extent
to
which
i
--
i
met
to
infer
that
that
is
not
binding.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
actually,
the
davidson
case,
the
--
the
one
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to
at
302
i.c.c.,
is
actually
--
there
was
an
opinion
--
a
decision
by
the
commission
on
reference
from
a
district
court
and
it
is
now,
i
think,
being
reviewed
by
a
one-judge
court
on
the
theory
that
this
is
actually
a
complaint
for
money
damages.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
it's
not
unusual
where
all
that
is
sort
is
reparations,
your
honor.
that
is
the
--
that
--
that
is
the
--
there
is
a
special
statutory
provision
with
respect
to
the
monetary
reparations
and
awards.
but
as
i
say,
i
would
prefer
not
to
be
drawn
in
to
any
controversies
to
what
might
happen
two
years
from
now.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
--
mr.
morton
hollander
all
we're
asking
--
all
we're
asking
for
here
is
an
opportunity
to
have
our
day
in
court
to
establish
our
defense
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
--
i,
myself,
see
no
real
room
for
--
for
any
dispute
on
that
question.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
and
we
think
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
just
as
in
western
pacific,
it
was
not
only
proper,
it
was
not
only
appropriate,
but
it
was
mandatory
on
the
district
court
in
both
cases
to
afford
us
an
opportunity
to
establish
our
defense
of
unreasonableness
before
the
only
body
charged
by
congress
with
the
responsibility
for
adjudicating
that
question,
namely
interstate
commerce
commission.
thank
you.
