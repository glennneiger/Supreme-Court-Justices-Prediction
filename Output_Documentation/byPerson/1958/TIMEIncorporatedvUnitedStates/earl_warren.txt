chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hollander,
what
authority
do
you
--
do
you
rely
on
to
give
the
court
authority
to
grant
reparations
prior
to
the
--
to
the
date
of
finding
by
the
commission
that
the
act
is
unreasonable,
i
mean
that
the
rate
is
unreasonable,
after
this
reference
has
been
made
to
it,
isn't
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
isn't
it
necessary
for
you
to
sustain
that
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
authority
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
we're
again
back
now
to
the
question
that
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
i
asked
you.
you
--
you
told
us
what
the
commission
would
tell
a
shipper.
now,
the
commissioner
says
you
must
--
you
must
go
to
the
court
and
the
court
will
refer
back
to
us
and
then
we'll
determine
whether
it's
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
now,
does
it
go
on
and
--
and
then
you
said,
you
can
go
to
the
court
if
we
find
that
unreasonable.
do
they
go
on
beyond
that
and
tell
--
tell
the
carrier
that
he
may
then
get
reparations
for
past
unreasonable
charges
or
that
and
in
relief,
he
can
get,
will
be
in
the
future
after
the
determination
that
the
rate
is
unreasonable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
in
what
cases
has
that
been
done?
what
cases
do
you
rely
upon
in
which
that
has
been
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
the
commission
has
determined,
on
reference,
the
unreasonableness
of
the
order,
what
case
do
you
rely
upon
as
saying
that
the
court
may
then
grant
reparations?

justice

34.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hollander,
i
--
i
don't
challenge
your
position.
all
i
want
to
know
is
if
you
have
any
authorities.
if
you
do,
i
want
to
read
them
and
that's
all.
i
don't
argue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
--
how
did
the
government
distinguish
the
montana
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rea,
your
answers
to
justice
black,
you
will
rely
on
montana-dakota?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
basis
for
your
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
do
i
--
do
i
understand
that
according
to
your
reason,
the
dissent
in
that
case
did
not
reach
that
problem,
did
not
object
to
that
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
which
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
alright.
it's
alright.
you
--
you
made
your
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
adjourn
now.
