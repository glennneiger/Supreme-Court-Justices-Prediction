mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
i
represent
petitioner
in
number
96,
and
if
it's
agreeable
with
the
court,
i
should
like
to
proceed
for
30
minutes
to
be
followed
by
mr.
benson
who
represents
the
petitioner
in
68.
we
realize
that
we're
reversing
the
usual
order,
but
we
think
it
will
be
more
helpful
this
way.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
facts
in
the
davidson
case
are
quite
simple,
somewhat
more
simple
than
the
facts
in
the
t.i.m.e.
cases,
i
may
call
it,
but
the
issues
are
precisely
the
same
in
both
cases,
that
is
the
only
issue
in
the
t.i.m.e.
case
and
the
issue
on
the
first
question
presented
in
the
davidson
case
are
identical.
and
that
issue
is
the
right
of
a
shipper
by
motor
carrier,
common
motor
carrier,
regulated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
to
recover
reparations
for
allegedly
unreasonable
rates
charged
in
the
past.
now,
i'd
like
briefly
to
outline
the
facts
in
the
davidson
case.
in
1950,
new
york
state
passed
a
statute
imposing
what
was
called
a
ton-mile
tax
on
all
motor
carriers
using
the
highways
of
new
york
to
transport
property
within
the
state,
through
the
state
or
from
points
within
the
state
to
points
without
the
state
or
from
points
without
the
state
to
points
within
the
state.
the
common
carriers,
by
motor,
operating
in
new
york,
in
september
of
1951,
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
what
was
called
the
new
york
state
surcharge.
and
that
surcharge
simply
imposed
a
charge
over
and
above
the
ordinary
rate
on
a
particular
movement,
operative
throughout
the
areas
served
by
these
common
carriers,
which
is
the
northeast
area,
which
extra
charge,
surcharge
was
designed
to
compensate
the
carriers
for
the
additional
cost
involved
in
the
ton-mile
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
new
york.
it's
to
be
noted
that
this
surcharge
was
applicable
only
on
movements
on
which
the
surcharge
was
required
to
be
paid
by
the
state,
namely,
movements
in
new
york,
in
whole
or
in
part.
on
october
5,
1951,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
suspended
the
operation
of
the
surcharge
for
a
period
of
seven
months
and
ordered
an
investigation
of
it.
on
may
8,
1952,
the
period
of
suspension
expired
and
pursuant
to
section
216
(e),
the
surcharge
went
into
effect
as
the
file
tariff
for
the
carriers
as
required
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
on
may
29,
1952,
davidson
transported
four
shipments
for
the
united
states
government,
all
of
which
moved
in
part
through
the
state
of
new
york.
davidson
presented
its
bill
to
the
united
states
government
for
those
--
for
its
charges
for
those
four
shipments,
if
bill
was
paid
that,
as
far
as
davidson
was
concerned,
ended
the
matter.
on
july
20,
1953,
the
investigation
of
the
surcharge
ordered
by
the
commission
having
continued
all
of
this
time,
the
commission
found
that
the
surcharge
was
basically
not
an
appropriate
way
in
which
the
carriers
should
recover
the
cost
of
the
ton-mile
tax.
they,
therefore,
ordered
the
surcharge
cancelled
and
they
admonished
the
carriers
that
the
cost
of
the
ton-mile
tax
should
be
treated
as
any
other
operating
cost
and
that
the
carrier's
general
rate
level
should
be
designed
to
include
that
cost.
and
subsequently,
general
rate
increases
were
filed,
which
did
account
for
the
--
take
care
of
the
surcharge.
the
commission's
order
was
july
23,
ordered
july
20,
1953,
ordered
the
surcharge
cancelled
on
or
before
august
21,1953.
at
the
request
of
the
carriers,
the
date
for
cancellation
was
postponed
to
october
15,
1953,
and
on
that
date,
the
surcharge
was
cancelled.
thereafter,
the
general
accounting
office,
post-auditing
the
bills
of
davidson,
demanded
of
davidson
that
it
refund
to
the
general
accounting
office,
to
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
more
properly,
that
portion
of
its
charges
on
these
four
movements
which
represented
the
new
york
state
surcharge.
its
explanation
being
that
the
commission
had
subsequently
held
that
surcharge
to
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
had
ordered
it
cancelled.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
it
is
not
relevant,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
we
urge
to
the
court
below
that
the
order
of
the
commission
was
not
intended
to
be
retroactive
and
that
in
any
event,
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
make
it
retroactive.
the
court
below
said,
“we
don't
know.
we
will
refer
the
matter
to
the
commission
and
ask
them
what
they
meant
by
their
order
of
july
20,
1953.
did
they
intend
to
have
retroactive
effect
or
did
they
not.”
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
it
is
irrelevant
at
this
point,
your
honor,
and
it
is
irrelevant
on
the
issues
here
because
we
maintain
that
the
commission,
in
no
event,
has
any
authority
to
make
retroactive
findings
as
to
rate
reasonableness.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
that
issue,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
that
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
if
--
if
i'm
right,
it
becomes
irrelevant.
i
would
assume,
your
honor,
if
we're
wrong
that
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
followed
in
which
event,
the
order
would
be
referred
to
the
commission
for
an
interpretation
of
it.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
if
we're
wrong,
the
order
has
no
bearing
on
this
case
here,
except
to
this
extent
that
it
was
that
order
that
the
court
below
ordered
the
district
court
to
refer
to
the
commission
for
its
opinion
for
its
interpretation.
davidson
paid
the
refund
to
the
general
accounting
office
under
protest
and
brought
this
suit
to
recover
back
in
the
district
court
under
the
tucker
act.
the
only
defense
raised
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
surcharge
had
been
found
by
the
commission
to
be
unjust
and
unreasonable.
and
that
therefore,
the
carrier
was
not
entitled
to
recover
his
charges
based
on
it.
davidson
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
which
we
alleged,
(1)
that
the
order
was
not
intended
to
be
retroactive.
(2)
if
it
was
intended
to
be
retroactive,
it
has
no
legal
effect
that
the
only
right
that
a
shipper
has
is
to
the
rate
which
is
filed
and
effective
with
the
commission
at
the
time
the
transportation
is
rendered.
the
district
court
granted
our
motion
to
dismiss.
our
--
rather
granted
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
now,
our
position
here
is
that
the
montana-dakota
case
interpreting
the
federal
power
act,
controls.
that
case
is
reported
in
341
u.s.
246.
that
case
is
on
all
force
with
this,
except
that
the
position
of
the
parties
is
reversed.
there,
the
plaintiff
brought
a
suit
saying,
“i
want
to
recover
from
this
defendant
because
he
charged
me
unreasonable
rates
in
the
past.”
in
this
case,
respondent
recouped
the
rates
out
of
court,
through
his
own
power,
and
then
defendant
a
suit
by
the
carrier
to
recover
them
on
the
ground
that
they
were
unreasonable
in
the
past.
in
the
montana-dakota
case,
as
we
read
it
and
we
think
it's
the
only
tenable
reading,
this
court
held
flatly
that
the
right
to
a
reasonable
rate
is
the
right
to
the
right
that
is
filed
and
effective
with
the
commission
at
the
time
the
service
is
rendered.
the
argument
was
made
there,
just
as
respondent
argued
here
that
the
court
can
entertain
a
common-law
suit
that
there
is
a
common-law
right
to
a
reasonable
rate,
that
a
court
has
jurisdiction
of
that
cause
of
action
in
tort,
and
that
while
it's
true,
the
court
cannot
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates,
the
court
can
entertain
the
cause
of
action
and
refer
the
issue
of
the
reasonableness
to
the
appropriate
administrative
body.
that
argument
was
flatly
rejected
in
the
montana
case
because
the
federal
power
act
in
terms
--
not
in
terms,
but
was
interpreted
as
restricting
the
power
of
the
commission
over
rates
to
the
legislative
power
of
fixing
rates
for
the
future.
we
submit
that
part
ii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
enacted
in
1935
within
a
few
days
of
the
power
act
and
containing
the
same
provisions
respecting
the
regulation
of
rates,
must
be
interpreted
in
the
same
way
that
the
federal
power
act
was
interpreted.
both
acts
start
out
requiring
the
seller
of
the
service
to
fix
just
and
reasonable
rates
and
prohibiting
unjust
and
unreasonable
rates.
both
acts
provide
for
the
filing
of
complaints
for
investigation
of
existing
rates
or
for
the
investigation
of
existing
rates
by
the
commission
sua
sponte
and
upon
the
completion
of
the
investigation
and
upon
the
finding
of
unreasonableness,
power
is
given
to
prescribe
rates
for
the
future
to
be
thereafter,
observed.
both
acts
provide
that
carriers
will
initially
establish
rates
in
the
case
of
the
i.c.c.
act,
and
that
the
power
company
will
initially
establish
rates
in
the
case
of
the
federal
power
act.
both
acts
gives
the
commission
power
to
suspend
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
in
the
case
of
the
power
act,
it's
five
months.
in
the
case
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it's
seven
months.
both
acts
provide
that
the
rate
shall
take
effect
upon
the
period
of
suspension,
upon
the
expiration
of
the
period
of
suspension.
neither
act
confers
any
authority
whatever
to
deal
with
the
reasonableness
of
rates
in
the
past.
absent
that
authority,
it
is
our
position
that
there
can
be
no
right
to
recover
for
the
--
for
alleged
unreasonableness
in
the
past.
the
common
law
right,
such
as
it
may
have
been,
is
necessarily
destroyed
because
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
the
federal
power
act
has
deprived
the
courts
--
has
deprived
every
court
of
its
power
to
determine
rate
reasonableness.
at
the
same
time,
it
has
deprived
the
commission
of
the
right
to
determine
rate
reasonableness
for
any
period
in
the
past.
and
as
justice
jackson
said
in
writing
for
the
majority
in
the
montana
case,
"the
issue
of
reasonableness
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
cause
of
action.
no
cause
of
action
for
the
charging
of
an
unreasonable
rate
can
exist
unless
the
rate
is,
in
fact,
unreasonable.
so
that
the
issue
of
unreasonableness
goes
not
just
to
the
damages,
but
it
goes
to
whether
or
not,
the
tort
was
in
fact
committed.
and
as
he
pointed
out
there,
to
hold
that
a
cause
of
action
for
unreasonableness
could
be
brought
in
court
and
then
the
only
issue
in
the
case,
namely,
reasonableness
or
not,
could
be
referred
to
the
commission,
the
result
would
be
to
obtain
from
the
commission
action
which
the
congress,
in
terms,
forbid
it
to
take.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
--
are
substantively
identical
in
their
treatment
of
the
problem
of
rate
regulation.
they
adopted
what
was
then
and
is
now,
the
vogue
in
rate
regulation.
that
is
the
filed
rate
theory.
the
seller
of
the
service
fixes
a
rate,
files
it
with
the
commission,
it
becomes
effective,
the
commission's
control
is
a
legislative
control
to
alter
it
for
the
future,
either
on
complaint
or
on
its
own
motion,
that's
all
spelled
out
by
this
court
very
recently
in
the
mobile
case
and
again
to
some
extent
in
the
memphis
case.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
in
this
respect,
part
ii
differs
from
part
i
and
that
brings
me,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
the
root
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
the
court
first
said
montana-dakota
doesn't
apply
here,
because
all
the
montana-dakota
case
held
was
that
a
complaint
to
a
federal
district
court
that
a
rate
charged
by
a
regulated
power
company
was
unreasonable
in
the
past,
states
no
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
power
act,
therefore,
said
the
court
of
appeals,
the
supreme
court
dismissed
the
complaint
there
being
no
diversity
of
citizenship
between
the
parties.
we
submit
that
the
court's
holding
is
far
broader
than
that.
it
did
not,
we
submit,
take
this
case
to
determine
whether
or
not,
or
to
delimit
rather,
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
delimiting
the
jurisdiction
of
district
courts,
since
your
course
--
or
courts
have
limited
jurisdiction.
the
holding
is
squarely
this,
as
we
see
it.
the
right
to
a
reasonable
rate
is
the
right
to
the
rate
that's
filed
and
effective
with
the
commission.
no
court
can
authorize
any
other
rate,
so
no
court
can
entertain
a
cause
of
action
claiming
a
right
to
another
rate.
the
commission
cannot
authorize
any
other
rate
as
a
judicial
matter
respecting
any
period
in
the
past.
the
commission's
authority
is
the
legislative
authority
to
fix
rates
for
the
future.
therefore,
to
hold
that
a
cause
of
action
existed,
would
be
to
say
that
the
court
can
entertain
a
cause
of
action
in
which
it
can
decide
no
issue,
then
the
commission
can
entertain
a
complaint
which
the
statute
does
not
permit
it
to
entertain
namely,
a
complaint
directed
to
the
past
rates,
then
the
commission
can
make
a
finding
and
then
the
court
can
go
ahead
and
render
a
judgment.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
saying,
we
submit,
to
read
the
montana
case
as
the
court
below
read
it
that
the
absence
of
power
in
the
courts,
coupled
with
the
absence
of
power
in
the
commission,
can
somehow
create
power
in
both
of
them
together.
the
government's
argument
and
shippers
arguments
generally,
they
go
into
the
court,
they
file
their
suit
and
the
court
said,
"we
can't
determine
what's
an
unreasonable
rate."
the
shipper
then
runs
over
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
files
a
complaint
alleging
that
this
rate
was
unreasonable
in
the
past.
of
course,
there's
no
authority
in
the
commission's
act
authorizing
it
to
make
adjudications
as
to
the
past,
but
the
shipper
says,
"oh,
the
court
has
a
cause
of
action
pending."
you
therefore,
as
a
collaborative
instrument
of
justice,
to
use
justice
frankfurter's
phrase
in
the
montana-dakota
case,
can
rend,
make
a
finding.
well,
as
the
majority
held
and
as
justice
frankfurter
speaking
for
the
majority
--
speaking
for
the
minority
agreed,
where
you
have
properly
filed
rates,
no
allegation
of
fraudulent
filing,
such
as
was
present
in
montana-dakota
and
is
not
present
here,
the
whole
theory
of
rate
regulation
is
premised
on
the
proposition
that
errors
in
rates,
unreasonable
rates,
will
be
corrected
by
prospective
action
by
the
commission
in
the
proscription
of
other
rates
for
the
future.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
here,
then
go
over
and
argue
after
all,
there
is
a
cause
of
action
against
a
rail
carrier
which
codifies
the
rail
---
the
shipper's
common-law
right
to
a
reasonable
rate.
there
must
be
also
such
a
right
against
the
common
carrier
by
motor
and
they
make
two
arguments.
they
say
first,
the
declaration
in
the
act,
that
rates
shall
be
just
and
reasonable,
creates
a
right,
creates
a
cause
of
action
in
a
shipper.
they
admit
that
the
act
provides
no
method
for
its
enforcement,
but
they
say
we
can
improvise
the
method
namely,
suit
by
the
shipper
in
a
common-law
court
or
in
a
--
in
a
common-law
court
followed
by
reference
of
the
issue
of
reasonableness
to
the
commission.
but
we
submit
that
part
i,
regulating
rail
carriers
and
its
specific
provisions
go
far
toward
negativing
any
intention
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
create
similar
rights
under
part
ii
in
regulating
motor
carriers.
part
i,
to
begin
with,
section
8,
specifically
says
that
"anybody
damaged
by
anything
done
by
a
rail
carrier
in
violation
of
the
act,
shall
have
redress
in
damages."
section
9
provides
that
the
shipper
may
either
complain
to
the
commission
pursuant
to
the
complaint
section
which
is
13
(1)
or
may
sue
in
a
federal
district
court.
section
13
provides
for
the
filing
of
complaints.
section
16
provides
for
the
issuance
of
orders
by
the
commission
determining
the
amount
of
damages
any
person
has
suffered
by
a
railroad's
violation
of
the
act
and
the
issuance
of
an
order
to
compel
payment.
section
16
(2),
provides
that
if
the
railroad
fails
to
obey
the
commission's
order
and
make
payment
within
the
time
specified
in
the
order,
the
shipper
may
file
suit
in
the
district
court
and
plead
the
order
of
the
commission
as
the
gravamen
of
his
complaint.
section
16
(4),
provides
a
statute
of
limitations
within
which
the
shipper
must
bring
his
complaint
for
damages
for
the
exaction
of
an
unreasonable
rate
in
the
past.
none
of
those
provisions
are
found
in
part
ii
of
the
act
relating
to
motor
carriers,
not
a
single
comparable
provision.
the
only
reference
to
any
private
redress
for
alleged
violations
of
the
act
in
part
ii,
is
the
provision
that
suits
for
overcharges
to
recover
overcharges,
which
are
defined
to
exclude
charges
based
on
applicable
rates
and
properly
computed.
it
must
be
brought
within
two
years.
there
is
no
provision,
whatever,
for
any
private
redress.
the
redress
for
violations
of
the
act
is
carefully
limited
to
actions
by
the
commission
to
compel
enforcement.
that
is
section
222
(b).
and
interestingly
enough,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
which
considered
this
question
of
the
right
of
private
redress
for
alleged
violations
of
the
act
very
recently,
the
case
is
discussed
at
length
in
our
reply
brief,
which
was
filed
today.
that's
consolidated
freightways
versus
united
truck
lines
cited
by
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
this
past
october
and
recorded
in
330
p.2d
522.
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
examined
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
at
great
length.
and
it
pointed
out
that
the
original
proposed
act
did
provide
that
in
the
event
of
a
violation
of
any
of
the
provisions,
any
person
injured
or
the
commission
had
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
the
act.
when
the
act
was
enacted
in
the
following
year,
that
provision
for
private
redress
by
individuals,
persons
injured
was
stricken
and
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
goes
on
to
discuss
the
thinking
of
the
congress
that
they
were
taking
under
regulation,
some
10,000
motor
carriers
in
a
completely
chaotic
state
in
1935,
when
the
whole
problem,
as
the
government
says
in
its
brief,
was
to
raise
their
rates
from
the
--
on
economic
levels
at
which
they've
understood.
that
facing
for
the
first
time
as
mr.
eastman
who
was
then
coordinator
of
transportation,
testified
about
the
bill.
the
commission
was
faced
with
some
terrific
regulatory
problems.
so
that
it
was
quite
logical
and
sensible
that
they
confined
redress
for
alleged
violations
of
the
act
to
the
commission,
so
that
the
development
of
the
regulation
of
motor
carriers,
which
was
being
taken
over
then
for
the
first
time,
would
proceed
in
an
orderly
way.
certainly,
the
congress
as
the
government
said
had
the
background
of
part
i,
dealing
with
rail
carriers
before
it,
at
the
time
it
enacted
part
ii
in
1935.
if
it
had
intended
to
give
shippers
by
motor
carriers,
the
same
rights
to
damages
that
it
had
earlier
given
shippers
by
railroad,
it's
inconceivable
that
it
would
have
conferred
that
cause
of
action
by
the
simple
declaration
that
unjust
rates
are
unlawful,
unjust
and
unreasonable
rates
are
unlawful,
when
it
had
before
it
and
at
the
very
time
it
amend,
it
past
the
motor
carrier
act,
amended
part
i,
it
had
before
it
all
of
those
elaborate
provisions
for
damages
against
rail
carriers.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
scheme
in
part
i
corresponds
with
the
scheme
in
part
iii.
part
i,
of
course,
is
the
early
act
beginning
in
1887,
dealing
with
railroads.
in
1935,
the
congress
passed
the
federal
power
act
and
it
passed
the
motor
carrier
act.
those
two
are
identical
in
their
substantive
provisions.
the
scheme
is
the
same
that
provisions
are,
in
many
respects,
so
far
as
it's
possible
for
them
to
be
word
for
word.
in
1940,
the
commission
brought
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
congress
brought
under
regulation
the
water
carriers,
common
carriers
by
water,
and
interestingly
enough,
18
--
the
old
act
of
part
i
begun
in
1887,
makes
elaborate
provisions
for
reparations
by
shippers
charged
unreasonable
rates.
1935,
the
congress
passes
the
federal
power
act
and
the
motor
carrier
act
neither
contain
any
provisions
for
reparations
both
limit
the
commission
to
this
legislative
function
of
fixing
rates
for
the
future.
in
1940,
five
years
later,
the
congress
enacted
part
iii
of
the
act
bringing
common
carriers
by
water,
certain
of
them,
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
went
back
to
the
scheme
of
part
i
and
part
iii,
enacted
in
1940,
contains
precisely
the
elaborate
provisions
for
reparations
that
are
contained
in
part
i.
i'd
like
to
make
this
point
to
the
court
of
appeals,
spoke
in
terms
of
the
right
they
thought
existed
from
the
declaration
that
rates
be
--
must
---
must
be
just
and
reasonable,
which
as
this
court
held
in
the
montana
cases,
a
criterion
for
administrative
action.
it's
a
standard
by
which
rates
are
regulated.
it
is
not
the
creation
of
a
justiciable
right.
but
they
also
went
on
to
say
that
after
all,
at
common-law,
there
was
a
right
to
a
reasonable
rate
enforceable
as
to
the
past
in
a
common-law
court.
we
submit,
and
we
think
we
demonstrated
in
our
brief,
that
there
could
not
have
been
a
common-law
right
to
a
reasonable
rate
for
the
interstate
movement
of
goods
because
there
is
no
federal
common-law.
the
recognition
of
such
a
right
would
mean
that
a
state
court,
under
state
law,
would
determine
the
reasonableness
of
rates
for
interstate
transportation.
and
certainly,
it's
been
held
as
from
the
wabash
case,
forward
that
there
is
no
state
authority
who'll
regulate
rates
and
the
existence
of
a
common-law
right
which
requires
state
action
for
the
implementation
--
for
the
determination
of
the
reasonable
rate,
in
our
view,
would
be
to
give
the
states
power
that
they
don't
have
under
the
constitution,
namely,
the
right
to
fix
rates
for
interstate
commerce.
the
government's
principal
reliance,
in
its
brief,
is
on
this
court's
recent
decision
in
western
pacific,
the
western
pacific
case
--
western
pacific
versus
the
united
states.
and
i
just
like
to
make
this
distinction
which
we
think
is
patent.
in
the
western
pacific
case,
the
general
accounting
office
deducted
alleging
that
particular
rates
on
what
the
carriers
classified
as
aerial
bombs
were
not
proper
because
the
items
transported
were
not
bombs
at
all,
they
were
napalm
gel.
the
carrier
brought
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
to
recover
the
amounts
deducted
by
the
general
accounting
office.
the
government
alleged
that
the
rates
were
inapplicable
and
if
in
--
if
applicable,
unreasonable.
the
court
of
claims
disallowed
the
defense
on
the
ground
that
it
could
not
determine
whether
the
rates
were
reasonable
and
that
the
statute
of
limitations
in
section
16
of
the
act
which
provides
for
the
filing
of
complaints
for
damages
with
the
commission,
had
run,
was
applicable
to
the
government
and
barred
the
commission
from
considering
the
matter
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates.
this
court
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
claims
with
directions
to
refer
the
issue
to
the
commission,
but
this
court's
position
was
that
in
that
case,
there
was
no
distinction
in
practicality
between
the
allegation
that
the
rates
were
inapplicable
and
the
allegation
that
the
rates
were
unreasonable.
it
took
the
view
that
the
government's
position
was
that
the
rates
were
inapplicable
and
that
one
reason
the
government
maintain
that
they
were
inapplicable
is
that
---
that
because
their
use
would
produce
an
unreasonable
result.
now,
we
think
that
all
that
case
holds
is
that
where
a
tariff
is
ambiguous,
you
can
resort
to
parole
evidence
namely,
you
can
examine
the
result
of
one
construction
as
opposed
to
the
result
of
another
to
ascertain
its
applicability.
but
in
any
event,
that
case
proceeded
on
the
perfectly
proper
premise
that
a
shipper
did
have,
under
part
i
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
a
right
to
a
reasonable
rate
even
though
different
than
the
file
and
effective
rate.
so
there
was
no
question
whatever
raised
at
any
point,
but
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
fundamental
jurisdiction
bestowed
on
it
by
part
i
to
ascertain
whether
or
not,
that
rate
charged
in
that
past
period
was
reasonable
and
that
the
shipper
had
bestowed
upon
him
by
part
i,
a
right
to
recover
damages
if
he
had
been
charged
an
unreasonable
rate,
but
to
cite
or
to
rely
as
the
government
does
on
that
case
here,
is
to
beg
the
question.
it
is
to
assume
the
answer
to
the
very
question.
it
is
to
assume
that
there
is
a
justiciable
legal
right
to
some
rate
other
than
the
filed
and
effective
rate.
and
that's
the
question
before
your
honors.
is
there
such
a
right?
we
submit
that
there
is
not
that
the
interstate
commerce
act,
part
ii
or
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935,
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
congress
was
adopting
the
scheme
of
the
federal
power
act,
enacted
in
the
same
time
and
the
natural
gas
act,
enacted
three
years
later
in
1938,
which
calls
for
the
filing
of
rates
and
limits
the
rate
regulatory
authority
of
the
commission
to
the
fixing
of
rates
for
the
future
on
the
assumption
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
the
montana
case
that
if
rates
filed
initially
by
the
carrier
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
turn
are
found
to
be
unreasonable
or
are
unreasonable,
they
will
be
quickly
corrected
by
the
proscription
of
new
rates
for
the
future.
i'd
like
to
reserve
what's
time
we
have.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
minute
to
suggest
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
his
colleagues
in
their
dissent
in
the
montana-dakota
case
do
not
dissent
from
the
proposition
which
we
urge.
i
would
like
to
quote
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
language
at
page
258
of
341
u.s.,
“despite
the
unqualified
statutory
declaration
that
unreasonable
rates
are
unlawful,
which
is
the
precise
declaration
upon
which
the
respondent
relied
here,
we
think
it
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
either
court
or
commission
to
have
the
power
to
award
reparations
on
the
ground
that
a
properly
filed
rate
or
charge
has
in
fact
been
unreasonably
high
or
low.
if
that
were
all
the
complaint
before
us,
showed,
and
if
i
may
interpolate,
that
is
all
the
proceedings
here
shows.
there
is
no
allegation,
but
that
the
rates
of
davidson
and
the
rates
of
t.
i.
m.
e.
were
properly
established.
if
that
were
all
the
complaint
before
us
showed,
we
would
agree
that
recovery
of
damages
in
a
civil
action
would
not
be
an
appropriate
remedy
and
that
the
complaint
should
have
been
dismissed.
now,
we
submit
that
that
language
which
is
squarely
in
accord
with
the
language
of
the
majority
in
that
opinion,
on
that
point
relating
to
properly
filed
rates,
controls
here.”
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
this
would
have
to
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
if
we
file
the
rate,
it
was
clearly
excessive.
the
commission
would
promptly,
on
its
own
motion,
suspend
that
rate
for
a
period
of
seven
months.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
once
the
rate
properly
takes
effect
and
is
applicable,
filed
with
the
commission
and
effective,
the
shipper
has
no
remedy.
no,
your
honor,
as
long
as
that
rate
is
filed
and
effective.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
no
he
could
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
he
could
challenge
it.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
i've
--
i
understood
you
to
mean,
does
he
have
any
remedy
by
way
of
recovery
back.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
he
has
no
remedy
as
far
as
recovering
back
is
concerned.
his
remedy
is
to
go
to
the
commission,
file
a
complaint
and
ask
the
commission
to
declare
that
rate
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
to
order
the
carrier
to
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
--
substitute
to
other
forms.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
it
does
not
help
him,
your
honor,
with
reference
to
the
shipment
that
has
already
moved
at
that
rate.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
no
refund
is
permissible.
no,
your
honor,
any
more
than
it
was
permissible
in
montana-dakota.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
however
unreasonable
as
of
theoretical
matter,
your
honor,
it
could
be
a
ridiculous
rate.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
and
it
could
be
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
it
could
be
that
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
fails
to
suspend
it
and
it
takes
effect.
and
it's
six
months
before
it's
cancelled
and
in
the
meantime,
practically
to
be
done
with.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
that's
right,
i
would
say
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility
that
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
i
am
saying,
your
honor
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
--
yes,
as
a
matter
of
law
--
as
a
matter
of
law,
davidson
could
file
a
rate
tomorrow,
$100
per
hundred
for
transportation
from
baltimore
to
washington.
and
it's
possible
that
the
commission
would
not
take
any
action
on
until
45
days
have
passed,
in
which
event
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
--
in
which
to
that
--
take
effect
at
the
end
of
30
and
it
would
be
15
days
during
which
that
rate
was
in
effect.
it's
possible
that
a
shipper
might
move
some
traffic
under
that
rate
and
pay
that
$100
rate.
if
that
happens,
he
would
have,
under
the
law,
no
refund.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
the
commission
would
not
let
that
rate
stay
on
in
and
there's
a
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
davidson
transfer
&
storage
company,
faced
with
the
vicious
competition
of
other
motor
carriers
between
washington
and
baltimore
was
never
violated.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
and
if
he
did
file
it,
no
shipper
would
give
him
any
business.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
are
you
referring,
justice
black,
to
the
situation
where
you
have
a
rate
from
washington
to
baltimore,
and
rate
from
baltimore
to
philadelphia
and
then
another
rate
washington
to
philadelphia?
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
in
the
event
you
would
have
a
series
of
rates,
a
shipper
can
get
the
benefit
of
those
rates
if
he
wants
to
ship
his
goods
from
washington
to
baltimore
and
then
reship
them
from
washington
to
philadelphia
and
then
reship
them
from
philadelphia
to
trenton
and
then
reship
them
from
trenton
to
new
york.
in
that
situation,
he
paid
that
combination
of
local
rates.
if
however,
he
tenders
his
shipment
to
davidson
transfer
&
storage
company
in
its
washington
terminal,
under
a
bill
of
lading
calling
for
delivery
in
new
york
through
shipments,
he
must
pay
the
through
rate
published
and
applicable
to
that
through
movement.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
he
--
he
has
no
recovery
for
anything
he
has
paid
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
--
while
that
rate
is
in
effect.
his
remedy,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
the
montana-dakota
case,
is
to
go
to
the
commission
and
say
this
rate
is
unreasonable.
we
want
you
to
find
it
unreasonable
and
we
want
you
to
order
the
carrier
to
put
in
a
new
one.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
he
cannot
get
anything
back
for
that
movement
that
moved
today.
no,
your
honor.
the
commission
will
issue
an
order
which
is
the
only
power
the
commission
has
to
make
the
rates
change
prospective.
i
would
say
this,
if
i
can
just
in
one
further
answer,
mr.
justice
black,
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
very
few
cases
in
which
rates
are
suspended
in
which
the
finding
of
the
commission
and
is
not
made
within
the
suspension
period.
and
the
commission
has
developed
a
practical
matter
--
method
of
expediting
those
cases.
they
are
very
rigorous
in
postponements
of
time
or
extensions
of
times
for
pleadings
and
that
sort
of
thing
so
that
it's
a
practical
matter
in
almost
every
instance
in
which
a
rate
is
protested
and
suspended.
the
determination
as
to
its
reasonableness
is
made
before
the
seven-month
period
of
the
suspension
expires.
now,
that
is
not
true
in
some
agencies.
it's
not
true,
for
example,
in
the
federal
power
commission
where
it's
unheard
of
to
reach
a
decision
within
the
five-month
suspension
period,
but
fortunately,
motor
carrier
rate
cases
are
much
less
complex
than
natural
gas
rate
cases
so
that
you
do
get.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
postponed
for
some
time
because
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
ton-mile
tax
was
being
litigated
in
new
york.
furthermore,
the
propriety
of
the
surcharge
on
intrastate
movements
was
before
the
new
york
public
service
commission.
and
the
three
proceedings,
the
proceeding
on
the
surcharge
for
intrastate
commerce
before
the
new
york
public
service
commission
and
the
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
court
litigation
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
ton-mile
tax,
all
were
more
or
less,
rolling
along
together.
and
as
your
honors
all
know,
when
you
get
several
cases
rolling
together,
it
usually
takes
a
longer
time.
thank
you.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
we
rely
on
montana-dakota.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
that
is
the
basis
for
our
holding,
montana-dakota,
as
it
interprets
the
federal
power
act,
which
as
we
read
it
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
--
is
on
all
force
substantively
in
its
rate
regulatory
procedures
with
part
ii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
the
dissent
in
that
case
was
based
on
the
allegation
that
the
buyer
of
the
service,
montana,
had
been
fraudulently
dominated
by
the
seller
of
the
service
and
therefore,
was
prevented
by
that
fraud
from
availing
himself
of
the
remedies
provided
in
the
act,
namely,
complaint
with
a
request
to
the
commission
to
find
the
rate
unreasonable.
in
other
words
--
well,
i
think,
here
--
mr.
bryce
rea,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
