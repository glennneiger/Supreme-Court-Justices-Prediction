justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
become
relevant
now,
or
(inaudible)
whether
the
cancelation
of
that
surcharge
by
the
commission
either
in
terms
or
by
virtue
of
the
law
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
retroactive
--
operated
retroactively
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
surcharge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
irrelevant
in
this
context?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
we
have
to
pass
on
that
issue
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you're
right,
it
becomes
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
wrong,
what
is
its
bearing
upon
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
doesn't
that
all
depend
on
how
the
--
the
goods
were
shipped.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
if
the
shipper
may
have
an
election,
couldn't
he
have
an
election,
if
in
fact,
there
were
two
local
rates
and
--
and
a
joint
rate,
the
shipper
could
certainty
elect
to
send
it
from
point
a
to
point
b
and
there
from
point
b
to
point
c,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
not
in
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
so
that
--
that
the
--
the
consignment
slips,
or
whatever
they
are,
only
centered
from
a
to
b
and
from
there
that
my
agent
will
give
instructions
what
to
do
when
you
get
to
b.
and
the
agents
there
extended
on
to
c.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
thing.
that's
because
the
(inaudible)
it
couldn't
thereby
avoid
the
applicability
of
a
--
you
couldn't
avoid
the
fact
that
that
was
one
(inaudible)
shipment.
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
couldn't
--
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
get
from
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
breaking
it
up
and
saying
it's
intrastate
commerce.
but
that
isn't
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i've
got
your
answer.
if
you
say
the
question
no
from
here,
then
it's
settled
by
the
record
and
by
agreement
that
that
was
the
applicable
rate,
the
question
is
what
you
could
recover.
i
can
understand
that,
but
i
have
a
little
difficulty
in
saying
that
if
in
fact
there
are
two
combination
locals,
which
on
the
peculiar
circumstances,
the
law
within
a
joint
rate,
the
shipper
can't
take
advantage
of
those
combination
locals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
--
tell
me
this.
is
it
--
it
is
clear
in
the
matter
of
law
so
that
they
can't
dispute
--
dispute
that
it
would
be
the
joint
rate
that
would
govern
and
not
the
combination
of
the
local
or
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
is
it
one
of
these
questions
as
to
which
one
would
have
to
get
the
judgement
of
the
i.c.c.?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
the
government
would
hear
from
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
government
admits
that
this
was,
as
a
matter
of
construction,
the
shipment
under
the
joint
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
the
settled
case
was
settled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
that
can
be
the
act
itself,
it
says
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
the
long
and
short
haul.
that's
a
different
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
is
--
i
think
justice
harlan
asked
whether
the
shipping
articles
are
in
here.
was
this
--
were
these
goods
destined
from
the
point
of
--
from
the
point
of
argue
to
the
ultimate
point
of
destination,
is
that
the
way
that
they
ship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think,
if
the
thing
is
open
for
argument
here,
you
would
say
that
is
a
clear
indication
that
it
should
be
a
through
shipment,
and
if
it
is
a
through
shipment
then
the
joint
(inaudible)
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
go
to
--
i
can
go
to
a
document
and
find
out
what
the
commission
said
that
if
you
send
these
goods
from
whatever,
the
california
point
to
the
oklahoma
point
was
that
that's
the
rate
that
should
apply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
such
a
document?
what
is
the
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
tariff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
that's
what
the
tariff
said,
but
does
that
settle
the
question
that
if
there
are
two
--
if
there's
an
intermediate
point
to
which
shipments
may
be
made,
that
the
shipment
may
break
up
the
shipment
into
two
parts,
into
two
legs.
does
the
tariff
tell
me
that
that
he
can't
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
over
the
same
tariff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
have
indicated
by
the
two
--
by
the
point
of
origin
and
the
point
of
destination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
straighten
out
your
mind,
but
i
think
you've
one
is
in
danger
of
confronting
two
things.
you
do
not
deny
that
the
joint
rate
is
the
relevant,
the
applicable
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
reasonable
rate.
what
you
say
that
it
may
be
challenged
as
not
being
--
although
the
legal
rate,
it
may
be
invalidated
that
it's
being
an
unreasonable
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
not
say
as
the
matter
of
law
in
this
case,
the
two
combined
local
rates
govern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
well
that's
a
very
different
thing,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
challenge
the
reasonableness
of
the
through
joint
rate.
that's
your
position,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although
you
paid,
although
the
original
exaction
was
on
the
joint
rate
was
good
a
then
the
local
rate
indeed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hollander,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
if
you
--
i
think
if
the
government
is
in
no
different
position
on
this
aspect,
on
this
--
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
take
davidson
and
i'm
going
to
talk
about
davidson,
then
a
private
shipper
would
have
been,
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
this
of
a
private
shipper.
he
would
have
to
pay
the
rate
at
the
time
of
shipment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
from
the
time
the
shipments
began,
during
the
period
of
the
lifting
or
the
suspension,
the
private
shipper
would
not
have
had
to
be
subjected
of
her
charge
or
whatever
it
was,
$4,
whatever
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
prior
to
the
lifting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
after
the
lifting,
the
position
of
the
private
shipper
would
be
that
he
would
have
to
pay
the
filed
tariff.
he
would
pay
it
under
protest
and
he
would
begin
reparation
proceedings,
would
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
don't
get
over
to
davidson.
that's
more
complicated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
wasn't
even
talking
about
davidson,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
like
a
private
shipper.
after
the
surcharge
was
--
after
the
suspension
was
lifted,
the
private
shipper
would
ship
and
he
would
have
to
pay
at
the
time
of
shipment,
would
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
would
protest
the
rate
is
unreasonable
and
he
would
begin
reparation
proceedings
before
the
commission,
challenging
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
old
reparation
proceedings,
well,
would
he
--
during
the
period
that
the
rate
was
not
found
to
be
unreasonable
could
he
get
reparations
retrospectively?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
can
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
not
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
get
it
before
the
commission.
he
could
not
get
reparations
for
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
we
smack
up
against
montana
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
concededly,
proceedings
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
that
period
--
for
the
period
in
question,
independently
would
be
--
were
beyond
the
power
of
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
they
might
--
do
you
object
to
my
mode
of
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
an
originating
proceeding
could
not
be
brought
before
the
commission
for
the
recovery
of
the
excess
on
the
basis
of
the
rates
as
charge
was
unreasonable.
as
rate
is
filed
and
therefore
charged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
not
challenge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

situations
that
i
have
--
i
haven't
read,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
bell
potato
chip
case.
are
those
situations
like
the
el
dorado
case
we
had
here,
way
back
308
u.s.?
justice
felix

(voice

where
contract
question
arises
as
between
(inaudible)
i
think
that
was
the
lessor
and
lessee
of
a
private

and
you
can
refer
some
question
of
a
tariff
to
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
el
dorado.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
what?
you
tell
us
why
el
dorado
didn't
govern
montana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
yes,
i
thought
so
too,
but
five
is
more
than
four
[laughter].
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
has
overruled
it,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
--
don't
the
--
don't
suggest
the
derogatory
implication
about
sacrosanct
because
the
point
of
our
pay
filed
rate,
has
a
long
and
deep
history
of
(inaudible)
there
are
innovation,
rebates
et
cetera,
et
cetera
on
the
greatest
of
all
evil
because
in
railroad
affairs,
but
you're
sought
to
be
cured
by
making
the
fixed
rate,
the
absolutely
determining
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wraps
himself
around
in
the
opinion
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hollander,
it
might
have
been
better
done
having
the
part
of
your
(inaudible)
but
wouldn't
you
say
that
those
considerations
of
fairness
and
justice
--
unjust
enrichment,
all
the
rest,
were
at
least
adverted
to
dissent
which
did
not
find
favorable
to
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
--
and
was
rejected.
justice
felix

but
mr.
--
mr.
hollander
before
the
motor
carrier
act,
common-law

there
was
no
regulatory

force
the
common-law
remedy

be
destroyed,
except
insofar
as
the
--
the
motor
carrier
act
reserved
its
right
in
that
--
justice
felix

--
because
it
took
over
--
it
relies
but
totally
different
involvement
of
protecting
to
break
an
interest.
justice
felix

part
of
the
motor

act
has
left
statement
regulation
of
the
common-law
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
say
the
motor
carrier
act
destroyed
like
of
that
have
destroyed
the
--
that
is
true
in
montana.
before
there
are
these
regulatory
systems
with
all
that
to
with
the
common-law
responsibility
of
the
carrier
to
charge
unreasonable
rates
and
left
it
to
the
jury
to
determine
how
many
(inaudible)
can
be
carried
at
what
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
thinking
the
whole
--
in
a
way,
what
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
you're
ought
to
be
back
in
common-law
the
mode
of
remedy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
not
through
the
federal
power
act?
every
--
after
charge
us
to
reasonable
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
the,
you
know,
my
feeling
about
the
--
i
expressed
my
views
about
that
case.
but
that
isn't
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
in
connection
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
particularly,
reached
decisions
which
considering
the
case
in
isolation
of
the
question
of
unjust
enrichment,
judged
only
by
common-law
standards
would've
reached
one
conclusion
which
is
the
case
where
justice
cardozo
wrote
i
forget
the
moment,
but
was
in
the
(inaudible)
dissent,
et
cetera.
if
another
rigorous
so-called,
rigorous
decision
in
which
we're
taking
into
account
not
the
individual
right
between
the
shipper
and
carrier
or
utility
operator
and
consumer,
but
a
system
such
in
it
is
when
of
how
you,
yourself,
point
out
congress
has
consistently
refused
to
give
me
proactive
reparation
powers
to
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
have
failed
and
therefore
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
reflects.
i
say
congress
hasn't
refused
to
confer
a
power
that
has
been
consistently
requested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
(inaudible)
you
are
entitled
to
argue
that,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
you
can
say
that
at
--
at
the
montana,
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
congress
usually
isn't
so
legislatively
parsimonious,
we
think,
all
we
need
(inaudible)
is
extra
confirming
act
because
it's
already
their
argumentatively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hollander,
the
abilene
oil
case
way
back
in
204
had
before
it
a
similar
provision
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
preserving
all
common-law
rights
and
you
said
practically,
the
scheme
which
the
act
established
nullifies
that
provision
because
of
the
inconsistencies
between
them.
and
now
that
i
have
read
your
case
in
302,
as
you'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
commission
says
that
if
there's
a
cause
of
action
allowable
in
the
court,
then
the
court
may
ask
the
commission
for
a
ruling
on
a
tariff.
but
you
don't
get
a
cause
of
action
by
having
the
commission
pass
on
the
tariff
ab
initio
to
begin
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
derived
a
cause
of
action
because
the
commission
can
do
what
it
can
do
in
the
reparation
proceeding.
but
if
you
didn't
have
a
cause
of
action
(inaudible)
the
commission,
then
you
can
get
a
reference
to
the
commission.
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
have
the
cause
of
action
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
precise
--
precisely
in
the
things
in
which,
as
you
properly
stated,
that
as
a
matter
of
fairness
and
justice,
like
--
i
thought
the
(inaudible)
contractual
basis
to
the
montana
case,
that
was
the
cause
of
action
that
emerged
in
that
case
and
this
court
rejected
that,
and
rejected
that
for
the
reason
given
in
the
court's
opinion.
but
you
don't
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
don't
lift
yourself
into
a
cause
of
action
because
there
may
be
a
reference
in
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
--
that
you
would,
now
--
did
you
just
indicate
a
doubt
whether
the
referring
court
or
the
(inaudible)
would
be
bound
by
the
determination
of
the
commission
on
the
rates,
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates?
it
should
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
expressed
the
doubt
and
you
get
yourself
into
the
--
into
the
box
that
you
said
you
ought
not
to
get
into,
namely,
that
you
may
have
diverse
views
on
questions
of
rates
of
different
courts
a
and
b
that
you
may
have
the
court
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate,
if
it
has
no
business
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
the
only
basis
for
reversing
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
he
could
challenge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
over
the
period
or
prior
to
the
period
that
he
has
filed
a
reparation
suit
challenging
the
reasonableness
of
the
joint
excessive
rate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
suppose
--
suppose
--
suppose
the
exacted
today,
he
goes
to
the
commission
today.
he
has
to
pay
it
and
not
get
his
goods
shipped.
the
commission
takes
it
up
and
decides
a
year
later
that
it
was
all
together
unreasonable.can
he
get
anything
back?
