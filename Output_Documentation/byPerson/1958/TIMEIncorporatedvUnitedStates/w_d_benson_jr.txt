mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
in
the
beginning
let
me
say
that
our
position
with
counsel
for
davidson
transfer
&
storage
is
identical.
the
facts
are
slightly
different
in
the
t.
i.
m.
e.
case
with
the
davidson
case.
the
t.
i.
m.
e.
case
arose
out
of
some
shipments
from
oklahoma
city
tinker
air
force
base
near
in
oklahoma
city,
oklahoma,
to
another
air
force
base
at
planehaven,
california.
the
tariff
which
prescribed
rates
for
that
movement
was
the
rocky
mountain
motor
freight
tariff.
and
it
named
the
rate
from
planehaven
or
from
tinker
air
force
base,
oklahoma
to
planehaven,
california,
at
so
many
cents
per
hundred.
t.
i.
m.
e.
was
a
party
to
another
tariff.
and
maybe,
i
should
explain
to
the
court,
perhaps
the
court
knows
more
about
the
way
these
tariffs
are
made
up
than
i
do.
but
in
the
early
growth
of
the
trucking
industry,
almost
all
carriers
were
small
localized
carriers.
and
when
it
became
necessary
under
the
motor
carrier
act
for
them
to
file
tariffs,
they
joined
together
and
formed
these
local
associations.
it
happens
that
my
client
now,
operates
from
los
angeles,
california
to
atlanta,
georgia
and
cincinnati,
ohio.
in
order
to
comply
with
all
of
those
different
local
situations,
it
is
now
the
member
of
28
different
tariff
bureaus.
among
the
other
tariff
bureaus
that
it
was
a
member
of,
it
was
a
member
of
the
southwestern
motor
freight
bureau,
which
names
rates
generally
between
texas,
oklahoma,
arkansas
and
louisiana,
el
paso,
texas
and
some
small
part
of
colorado.
it
was
also
the
member
of
another
tariff
bureau
which
is
the
interstate
tariff
bureau
which
names
right
between
california
on
the
one
hand,
el
paso,
texas
and
certain
other
territories.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
not
that
this
rate
is
too
high
because
it
calls
for
too
much
money,
but
the
government's
contention
is
that
this
rate
is
too
high
because
there
is
a
rate
from
tinker
air
force
base
to
el
paso,
plus
another
rate
on
another
tariff
from
el
paso,
texas
to
planehaven,
california.
and
that
the
sum
total
of
those
two
rates
is
less
than
this
through
rate
named
in
the
rocky
mountain
tariff.
the
position
of
the
court
below
was
that
first,
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
aggregate
of
intermediates.
and
secondly,
if
the
through
rate
was
the
applicable
rate,
then
because
it
had
exceeded
the
aggregate
of
intermediates
that
it
was
too
high
and
unreasonable.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
judge,
i
have
none
except
the
southwest
territory
generally
has
depressed
rates.
el
paso,
texas
is
a
gateway
to
mexico.
and
freight
has
predominantly
moved
from
the
west
through
el
paso.
so
carriers
going
into
el
paso
needed
tonnage.
carriers
going
from
el
paso
to
california
needed
tonnage.
and
that
is
the
only
explanation
that
i
know,
i've
seen
no
factual
figures
on
it.
but
any
event,
they
asked
the
court
then
to
hold
this
judgment
in
abeyance,
in
other
words,
the
local
--
the
district
judge
have
said.
well,
there
is
only
one
tariff,
it's
the
rocky
mountain
tariff
and
i
must
apply.
so
then
the
government
said,
"well,
if
the
court
please,
will
you
hold
this
in
abeyance
now,
that
want
to
file
a
complaint
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
is
not
provided
for
by
law
at
all.
and
we
want
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
this
rate
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable."
the
district
court
refused
that
idea
and
went
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
of
course,
the
court
below,
following
western
pacific
said
that
the
case
should
be
referred
through
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
their
decisions.
now,
the
point
i
should
like
to
make
to
this
court,
if
i
may.
this
case
involves
reparations.
whether
the
government
--
in
the
t.
i.
m.
e.
case,
they
--
they'd
simply
paid
the
aggregate
of
intermediates
and
never
get
paid
the
through
rate
at
all,
and
thus,
to
suit
against
the
government
for
the
difference.
and
that
is
what
the
lawsuit
is
about.
but
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
to
this
court
is
that
this
is
a
suit
for
reparation.
and
what
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
say
to
a
hundred
thousand
shippers
that
views
our
freight
limits.
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
you
follow
the
administrative
procedure
and
filed
your
tariff
as
prescribed
below
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
hasn't
been
any
complaint
filed,
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
itself
has
done
nothing
about
it,
that
even
after
you
have
followed
the
administrative
process
that
you
as
a
shipper
may
ship
within
the
period
of
limitations,
accepting
this
--
the
--
the
existing
rate,
the
applicable
rate
and
then
somewhere
down
the
line,
if
you
decide
that
that
rate
is
too
high,
that
you
refuse
to
pay
and
then
you
require
the
carrier
to
sue
you.
and
then
when
the
carriers
sued
upon
the
only
rate
that
exists
on
earth,
the
shippers
says
your
rate
is
too
high.
and
while
we
want
this
question
adjudicated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
because
it
involves
money,
well,
it's
simply
a
straight-out
proposition
for
reparations.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that
would
not
appeal
from
that,
your
honor,
and
there
could
be
no
dispute
about
it.
in
other
words,
the
southwestern
tariff
didn't
mainly
reach
beyond
el
paso.
the
interstate
freight
tariff
didn't
name
any
rates
eastward
of
el
paso.
so
the
only
tariff
in
existence
is
the
rocky
mountain
freight
bureau
tariff.
and
we
say
to
this
court
that
if
shippers
can
ignore
the
applicable
rate
and
ignore
the
administrative
process
provided
for
by
congress
and
still
get
an
adjudication
upon
the
question
of
unreasonableness
of
rate,
and
number
one,
that
is
bad
law.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
and
that's
the
suit.
in
other
words,
t.
i.
m.
e.
sued
the
government
for
the
difference,
between
the
--
the
intermediate
rates
and
the
applicable
rates.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
deny
that,
your
honor.
but
the
--
in
other
words,
it
--
i
--
it
is
our
position
that
there
must
be
a
tariff
in
existence.
and
that
you
can't
do
it
by
appeasing.
and
all
the
--
the
southwestern
motor
freight
bureau
tariffs
doesn't
name
a
rate
between
oklahoma
city
and
planehaven.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
that's
the
local
rate.
the
interstate
tariff
does
not
name
a
rate
between
planehaven,
california
and
oklahoma.
there
is
no
tariff
with
names
rates
between
those
two
points
except
the
rocky
mountain
motor
freight
bureau
tariff.
and
that's
what
brought
on,
of
course,
the
lawsuit.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well,
it
takes
southwestern
tariff
which
does
not
name
the
rates
toward
a
local
intermediate
point.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
doesn't
name
any
through
rates.
no.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
a
known
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
--
names
of
rate.
yes,
sir,
at
no
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
from
planehaven,
california
to
el
paso
texas.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
the
interstate
motor
freight
bureau
tariff
named
the
rate
from
el
paso
texas
to
planehaven,
california.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
then,
there
is
the
third
tariff
which
is
the
transcontinental
tariff
which
named
through
rates
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
southwestern
motor
freight
bureau
tariff
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
from
planehaven,
california
to
el
paso,
texas.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
then
--
well,
the
southwestern
motor
freight
bureau
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
the
interstate
motor
freight
tariff
names
a
rate
from
el
paso
to
planehaven,
california.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well,
the
difference
was
approximately
$6.70
or
80
cents
and
$10
and
something.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
it
took
the
weight
out
of
the
southwestern
motor
freight
tariff.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
from
planehaven
or
from
tinker
field,
oklahoma
to
el
paso,
texas.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
then
it
got
another
rate
out
of
another
tariff
from
el
paso,
texas
to
planehaven,
california.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
was
prior
to
the
time
of
the
use
of
the
section
22
quotations
and
the
government
at
that
time
was
simply
paying
the
prescribed
rates.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
i
say
it
didn't.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
that
was
the
only
rate
in
existence
upon
which
you
can
make
the
charge.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well,
in
theory
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
in
theory,
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
because
there
is
of
not
any
rate
named
between
plainhaven,
california
and
oklahoma
city
except
the
one
rocky
mountain
tariff.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well,
in
theory
that
--
that
could
be
done.
this
court
said
it
couldn't
be
done.
i
believe
in
the
--
the
settle
case
in
which
a
shipper
was
trying
to
use
an
interstate
tariff
to
a
certain
point
and
then
(inaudible)
on
an
intrastate
tariff
to
another.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
i
think
--
i
think
so,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
i
think
so,
sir,
but
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
sir.
well
actually,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
the
applicability
of
the
rates.
i
mean
there's
no
dispute
with
us
on
the
government,
i
mean
they
--
the
issue
is
whether
or
not,
the
applicable
rates
which
were
decided
by
the
court,
which
isn't
under
appeal
here,
was
settled
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
--
in
the
court
below.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well
actually,
the
way
they're
done,
your
honor,
they
are
shipped
on
a
government
bill
of
lading.
that
government
bill
of
lading
is
given
to
the
originating
care
which
in
this
particular
case
happened
to
be
lee
way
motor
freight
lines.
they
brought
it
to
oklahoma
city
and
gave
it
to
t.
i.
m.
e.,
t.
i.
m.
e.
transport
it
from
oklahoma
city
to
los
angeles
and
gave
it
to
a
connecting
carrier
in
los
angeles
who
carried
it
up
to
planehaven,
california.
because
t.
i.
m.
e.
was
the
long
haul
carrier,
well,
the
bill
of
lading
was
accomplished
in
behalf
of
t.
i.
m.
e.,
so
t.
i.
m.
e.
then
bill
the
government.
they
put
the
figures
on
the
bill
of
lading.
they
bill
the
government
for
the
through
applicable
rate.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
all
of
it.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
all
of
it.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
immediately
after
the
transportation
was
performed.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
then
the
government
on
order
to
the
bill
and
sent
t.
i.
m.
e.
a
check
for
was
the
aggregate
of
the
intermediates
and
that's
how
the
laws
had
arose,
but
getting
back
to
our
proposition,
it
seems
reasonable
to
us,
if
the
court
please,
that
an
act
passed
by
congress
spelling
out
the
authority
of
the
commission,
spelling
out
the
way
rates
shall
be
set,
how
they
may
be
changed
if
they
are
in
error,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
the
administrative
process,
and
that
is
the
process
that
all
shippers
must
go
through
in
order
to
comply
with
the
administrative
procedure
and
reach
the
end
of
the
act
which
congress
had
in
mind.
and
that
any
other
improvised
manner
whereby
a
shipper
can
set
a
rate,
well
as
an
example,
if
10,000
of
our
shippers
tomorrow
decided
that
our
rates
were
too
high,
under
the
referral
procedure
suggested
here
by
the
government,
we'd
be
through
--
we
couldn't
even
defend
them
and
we
are
(inaudible)
for
such
a
thing
can
take
place,
if
this
court
says
to
a
shipper
that
you
--
you
can
disregard
this
rate
that's
published.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
the
commercial
bill
of
lading
is
made
up
and
signed
at
the
shipper's
dock.
then
it
is
taken
to
the
office
as
it
took
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
it's
taken
to
the
office
and
then
rated
and
then
the
shipper
gets
a
copy
of
the
bill
of
lading
which
shows
the
rate.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
but
the
principle
is
the
same
at
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
but
that
there
is
only
one
way
to
fix
the
rates
in
the
united
states
and
that's
the
method
prescribed
by
congress.
when
we
do
that,
we
have
no
trouble.
and
if
we
try
to
do
it
any
other
way,
i
think
it'll
bring
on
and
be
out
of
condition.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
my
--
well
that's
--
that's
actually
my
position.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
actually
my
position
that
if
it
were
a
private
shipper,
that
i
would
immediately
have
been
compelled
to
suing
unless
he
paid
for
them
in
seven
days.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well
all
of
them
but
one,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
[laughs]
not
in
the
record,
but
all
of
them
but
one.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
i
think
it
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
think
the
law
was
quite
clear,
your
honor.
i
don't
really
convene
your
dispute
on
that.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
pardon.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
they
--
the
court
found
that
the
through
rate
was
applicable
and
they,
of
course,
didn't
appeal
from
that.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
on
that.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
it
--
it
demonstrates
you
can't
(inaudible)
rights.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well
i
believe
the
words,
your
honor,
is
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
--
that
the
prima
facie
to
be
unreasonable.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
there
is
a
tariff
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
no,
there
is
a
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
that's
in
part
i
on
the
rail
act
and
the
i.c.c.
has
what
they
call
the
tariffs
circular,
which
says
exactly
the
opposite,
"that
regardless
of
the
intermediate
rates
that
the
through
rates
shall
be
applicable."
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
in
part
ii,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
issued
a
tariff
which
says
that
the
through
rate
shall
apply,
a
tariff
circular.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well
that's
one
good
argument,
judge.
well
i
think
there's
a
better
one
because
there's
just
one
rate
prescribed.
in
other
words,
the
commission
regulates
these
rates
and
they
say
what
rates
apply
and
whether
they
are
filed
or
approved.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well
it's
the
tariff.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
the
tariff
says
that
the
rate
between
tinker
field
and
plain
--
planehaven,
california
is
so
many
cents
per
a
hundred.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
well,
you
--
you
could
do
that,
your
honor,
if
you
wanted
to
make
a
shipment
from
tinker
field
to
el
paso
--
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
(inaudible)
and
you
want
to
make
another
shipment
of
the
same
piece
of
merchandise
from
el
paso
to
planehaven,
california
over
another
one.
there
are
two
tariffs
that
provide
both.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
but
not
only
--
not
over
the
same
route
and
over
--
through
the
movement.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
benson,
jr.
yes.
that
is
the
official
rule
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
