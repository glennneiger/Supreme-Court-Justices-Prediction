justice
william

douglas
and
yet
the
court
--
and
the
commission
mean
in
the
bell
potato
chip
case
were
it
said
that
while
in
effect
that
its
decision
on
its
opinion
on
reasonableness
would
be
varied
advisory
opinion,
but
what
--
but
at
a
different
situation
veils
for
the
issue's
applicability
of
the
rate.
when
we
find
it
says
that
the
rates
charged
by
a
carrier
inapplicable,
it
had
once
becomes
the
duty
of
the
carrier
to
refund
any
overcharges
and
of
the
shipper
to
pay
any
under
charges
without
an
order
or
rather
action
on
our
part
and
without
resort
to
afford.
justice
william

is
there
--
is
there
an
administrative
remedy
in
case
of
the
issue's
applicability
rather
than
unreasonableness?
justice

this
is
the
motor
carrier
case.
justice
william

douglas
i
have
in
front
of
me
the
case
of
302
i.c.c.,
the
davidson
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
didn't
come
to
the
commission
pending
a
lawsuit,
did
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice

i
understand.
not
--
not
before
this
court.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
doesn't
appear
from
this
report
that
there
was
any
suit
filed
and
that
this
was
referred
over.
i
don't
--
there
may
have
been,
but
doesn't
appear
from
the
report,
but
at
the
--
the
last
sentence
in
the
--
in
this
report,
in
302
is
interesting
because
it
says,
“in
order
discontinuing
the
proceedings
will
be
entered.”
so,
apparently
there
is
some
reason
for
going
to
the
commission
other
than
getting
a
preliminary
ruling
or
unreasonableness
for
--
to
aid
--
in
aid
of
litigation.
