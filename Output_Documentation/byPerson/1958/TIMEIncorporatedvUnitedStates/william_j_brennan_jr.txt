justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
curious.
is
there
some
explanation
why
the
through
rate
should
be
higher
than
the
aggregate
of
the
intermediate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
didn't
pick
out
(inaudible)
to
the
intermediate.
if
i
understand
you
could.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
it
that
you
got
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
filed
rates.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
wasn't
there
a
period
after
the
filing
within
which
it
might
have
been
--
pleadings
might
have
been
interested
to
have
it
suspended?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
affect
and
suspended
the
surcharge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
which
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
because
the
proceeding
i
gather
the
determined
reasonableness
has
not
been
completed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
how
long,
after
the
end
of
the
suspension
period,
was
it
according
to
tariff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
--
that's
because
the
pressure
of
business
or
whatever
maybe
the
reason,
it's
not
possible
will
determine
these
things
within
the
seven-month
suspension
period,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
is
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
long
is
this
seven-month
suspension
period
in
effect
since
the
act
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
initially,
perhaps
was
possible
for
the
commission
to
determine
these
things
within
that
period.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
--
one
other
thing.
in
the
t.
i.
m.
e.
case,
i
gather
no
shipper
initiated
a
proceeding
which
would
--
which
brought
about
the
suspension
of
that
rate,
of
the
through
rate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
or
not
feasible
--
where
that,
i
gather,
that
proceeding
was
available,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
gone
to
the
existence
of
the
latter
part
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
like
the
bell
potato
chip.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
say
we
need
not
overrule
it?
how
can
we
distinguish
this
situation
from
you'd
have
prevail
how
otherwise
by
our
rule
on
this
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
one
is
this
federal
power
commission,
the
other
is
i.c.c.
and
that
makes
the
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
common
ground
is
against
you
though,
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't
the
dissent
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
primarily
on
the
fraudulent
application
on
that
allegation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
wasn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
little
difference
between
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
you're
not
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
but
that's
not
throughout
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
like
in
having
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
motor
carriers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hollander,
tell
me,
i
think
that
this
probably
germane
to
the
argument
you're
making.
if
there's
a
determination
that
the
charged
rate
is
unreasonable,
what
then
goes
to
the
fact
of
the
court,
just
that
determination
that
the
charged
rate
was
unreasonable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
--
what
then
determines
the
amount
that
should
be
paid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
i
suppose
you
failed
on
that
but
the
commission
says,
“well,
it's
unreasonable
to
the
extent
it
exceeds
8
cents.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
--then
well
what's
the
judgment
then,
that's
entered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
pay
6.5
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
well
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
in
other
words,
the
--
what
finally
then
is
the
issue
and
dispute.
the
proper
rate
to
be
determined
is
determined
by
the
commission
entirely
and
the
court
acts
merely
as
administratively
somehow,
to
enter
a
judgment
for
whatever
the
right
rate
is,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
if
a
judgment
is
entered,
it
has
to
be
a
judgment
determined
by
the
conclusions
of
the
commission
as
to
what
the
proper
rate
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
suggest,
i
think,
you're
wise
and
i'd
finally
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
does
