how
did
the
government
figure
its
tariff,
then
you
say
it's
paid
--
paid
you
a
combination
of
two
local
tariffs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
name
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
rate,
from
what
point
to
what
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
from
the
el
paso
to
what
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
and
you
had
another
one,
so
combine
them,
what
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
this.
i
want
to
know
what
are
the
two
local
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what
point
to
what
point
and
what
point
to
what
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
from
there,
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
is
there
another
rate
from
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
we
have
a
good
sense
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so
just
please
tell
me
how
the
government
figured
that
on
what
two
rates
it
insisted
it
had
a
right
to
join.
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what
point
to
what
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
what
other
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
where
there
such
tariff
published
for
those
local
--
those
two
points.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
claims
that
it
has
a
right
to
tell
you
those,
now,
just
in
combination?
if
you
tell
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
any
agreement
with
the
government
in
advance
about
what
rate
it
prefers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
it
went
to
pay,
it
insisted
that
since
was
the
law
and
if
you
combine
the
two,
it
had
a
right
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
it
didn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
your
controversy
because
you
say
it
was
bound
by
that
through
rate
and
couldn't
take
advantage
of
the
two
joint
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
do
they
bill
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
it
was
finished?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
other
shippers
use
the
same
practice
as
the
government
and
that
is
that
they
don't
find
out
what
the
carrier
is
charging
under
the
goods
delivered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
knowing
what
the
charge
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
shows
the
rate
before
it
goes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
government
doesn't
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
difference
between
the
two
methods
of
shipment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
granted
from
an
evil
practice
that's
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
would
have
violated
the
act
by
charging
these
two
combination
rates
instead
of
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
position
you
have
to
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
take
it
--
you
have
to
take
in
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
whether
the
private
shipper
has
been
taken
in
high
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
its
view
is
that
congress
denied
its
power
to
try
those
reparation
cases,
bears
on
the
reasonableness,
but
left
it
to
the
courts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
remedy
they
had
to
the
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
acts
on
the
assumption
--
acts
on
the
assumption
that
the
courts
have
that
power
and
that
it
can
then
place
on
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
courts
--
they
have
filed
the
trial
suits
in
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
the
commission
--
i
see
the
commission
took
the
position
that
the
statute
itself
had
preserved
the
common-law
right
to
sue
although
it
had
denied
giving
that
procedural
remedy
through
the
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
ask
you
whether
the
commission
relies
on
that
as
i
read
it
what
they
said
was
the
intention
of
preserving
that
right
and
therefore
they
took
the
file
under
the
old
common-law
act
statute
217
(b)
and
22.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
counsel
for
the
western
pacific
decided
the
montana
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
distinguished?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
in
effect
ask
us
to
overrule
montana
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

government
can
put
in
your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
why
the
--
this
thing
that
i
had
exposed,
the
abilene
case,
the
courts
have
held
that
in
case
where
it
is
proper
to
determined
reasons.
it
was
right
to
submit
it
to
the
i.c.c.
that
determine
reasonableness
--
this
is
all
we
did.
and
that
the
courts
would
leave
that
alone
unless
they
would
upset
an
order
of
the
commission
and
in
that
respect,
just
the
same
as
it
would
in
any
other.
hasn't
that
been
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i.c.c.
has
practically
served
as
a
(inaudible)
on
the
questions
of
reasonableness
in
proper
cases,
i'm
not
saying
it
should
in
proper
cases.
but
assuming
it's
the
proper
case,
i
would
suppose
that
there's
been
some
extraordinary
reason
for
upsetting
its
finding
of
reasonableness
should
be
followed
like
any
other
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
dispute
is
whether
or
not
it's
proper
to
have
accepted
in
thisway.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
had
filed
a
rate
today,
$50
per
pound,
would
that
be
binding
until
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

the
company's
action
mistaken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
--
if
somebody
paid
you
under
protest,
would
they
have
any
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

make
it
effective?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
suppose
you
make
him
pay
it
before
he
can
challenge
it,
what's
his
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
help?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
help
him
with
reference
to
the
rate
he's
already
paid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
no
refunds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
however
unreasonable,
it
might
be
held
to
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that
could
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
the
government
claims
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
meantime,
all
payments
made
on
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
that
because
it's
filed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
may
be
right.
i'm
just
asking
if
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
theoretical.
i'm
talking
about
actual.
i
--
i
thought
you
--
what
you're
saying
is
maybe
it's
right.
justice
hugo

black
(voice

justice

but
suppose
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
not
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
instead
of
that,
they
just
made
the
combined
rate,
if
you
shipped
it
all
the
way
through
four
times
what
the
rate
would
be
if
he
divided
up
into
parts,
but
to
be
in
a
refund
there,
if
the
court
--
if
the
commission
should
later
find
that
to
be
unreasonable.

philadelphia

from

justice

he
must
pay
it
and
however
unreasonable,
it
might
later
be
found
to

his
money
is
gone.
justice

there
is
no
remedy.
