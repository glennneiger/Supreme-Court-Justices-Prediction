(inaudible)
an
interpretation
of
the
relationship,
which
was
never
tried
out
below,
no
findings
of
fact,
and
we're
being
asked
to
pass
on
it
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
almost
is
an
original
suit,
isn't
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
the
while
issue
in
this
litigation
(inaudible)
whether
they
are
entitled
to
injunction
which
the
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
so
long
(inaudible)
now
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
can
show
that
the
equities,
granted
everything
that
they
say,
you
can
show
that
the
equities
are
against
them
because
of
whatever
you
want
to
argue
that
we
can
assume
that
everything
(inaudible)
relief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
now
why
don't
you
direct
yourself
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
then
we
are
dealing
with
things
that
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
whether
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wish
you
would
(inaudible)
particularly
what
has
been
done
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
patent
office
have
authority
to
issue
the
patents
without
paying
the
fees?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
does
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
suppose
it
did.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
it,
how
is
the
government
going
to
be
hurt?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
this
case
becomes
moot
mr.
edwards,
none
of
these
issues
have
been
adjudicated.
certainly
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
think
they
are
terribly
important
issues,
no
question
about
that
but
that
isn't
the
posture
of
this
case
and
if
we
are
confronted
as
long
as
long
as
we
don't
leave
on
the
books
a
precedent
that
does
adjudicate
these
issues
by
a
lower
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
your
answer
to
that,
and
that's
what
puzzles
me?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
if
this
case
ends
up
as
apparently
both
of
you
recognize
it
would
end
up,
as
soon
as
this
would
be
terminated,
as
soon
as
this
patent
issues,
in
other
words
your
rights
to
file
abroad
are
then
destroyed,
not
because
of
any
decision
in
the
litigation,
because
of
the
action
of
patent
office
and
that
moots
the
issuance
of
the
injunction,
the
thing
you
are
fighting
for
here,
and
that
action
of
the
court
results
in
clearing
the
record
below
of
any
adjudication
as
to
whether
the
government
had
the
right
to
do,
what
you
say
they
didn't
have.
i
don't
see
why
if
there
is
any
issue
of
consequence
that's
been
adjudicated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
they
are
vacated
and
stricken
up
the
records
as
just
as
if
they
have
never
been
issued
as
far
as
the
precedents
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
one
additional
thing
too
and
as
far
as
the
issue
which
i
--
you
stated
a
few
times
and
i
agree
with
you.
it's
the
issue
that
you
started
out,
and
it
is
an
important
issue,
the
chemical,
that
is
generally
but
that
issue
is
wiped
of
the
books
as
a
result
of
mootness
and
you
are
still
left
free
of
it
if
it
becomes
material
without
any
precedence
against
you.
if
the
government
resists
paying
you
compensation
you
are
still
free
in
that
litigation
to
litigate
that
thing
to
the
court,
then
the
precedent
could
be
established.
