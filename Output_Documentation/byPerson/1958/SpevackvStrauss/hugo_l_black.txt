justice
hugo
l.
black
the
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
as
denying
the
injunction,
because
they
(inaudible)
remedy
of
this
man's
property
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
haven't
many
cases
decided
a
right
to
negotiate,
a
property
right
which
could
be
protected
can't
be
taken
away,
can
give
rise
to
cause
of
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
need
not
be
liable
under
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
the
basis
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn't
get
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
are
denying
now
that
they
have
governmental
authority
to
do
this
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
suppose
they
agree
that
they
are
acting
under
governmental
authority
and
not
going
beyond
(inaudible)
by
the
government
as
they
should
act
as
government,
what
is
your
position
with
reference
to
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
passed?
you
have
(inaudible)
remedy
at
law
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
the
courts
of
appeals
has
held
that
yes
they
destroyed
the
value
of
the
property
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
do
have
the
authority
and
suppose
it's
held
that
they
do
have
the
authority
what
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
understand
that
argument,
but
i
do
not
understand
that
the
government
â€“
if
you
say
the
government
is
now
denying
the
(inaudible)
i
can
understand.
that
is
reasonable
to
say
that
you
could
compensation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
(inaudible)
the
government
had
a
right
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
deny
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question
(inaudible)
that
if
he
has
a
patentable
invention
you
take
the
position
that
the
government
(inaudible)
would
be
taking
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
it
would
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
been
over
two
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
during
that
time
could
he
have
applied
aboard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that,
but
could
he
have
been
--
was
he
able
to
apply
abroad
during
the
time
you
had
been
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
did
take
it
(inaudible)
right
to
negotiate,
try
to
get
it
abroad,
you
took
that
from
him
during
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
of
the
opinions
is
it
that
you
think
is
so
bad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
trying
to
find
which
one
do
you
think
is
established
(inaudible)
such
important
consequence
that
it
could
be
wiped
off?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
wouldn't,
if
the
government
decided
it
needed
something
from
--
by
this
property,
why
wouldn't
it
have
a
right
to
take
it
if
he
pays?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
have
to
wait
until
they
could
buy
it,
they
wouldn't
have
to
do
if
it
is
a
piece
of
real
estate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
they
could
go
down
on
the
street
and
take
a
man's
piece
of
property
and
they
can
(inaudible)
and
get
compensation,
what's
the
difference
in
taking
one
kind
of
property
and
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
don't
quite
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
well
suppose
they
didn't
get
it
by
contract,
but
they
take
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
might
be
the
best
public
use
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
dissemination
of
information.
if
in
other
words,
if
--
i
just
don't
quite
understand,
if
the
government
has
taken
something
which
is
public,
be
considered
public,
right
to
negotiate,
right
to
publish,
right
to
(inaudible)
and
it's
liable
to
pay
for
it,
what
is
then
the
opinion
that
court
rendered
below
that
is
bad?
i
don't
find
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
excise
it
formally,
but
it
would
be
taking
of
it,
taking
it
away
from
him,
if
they
did
that,
which
destroyed
your
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
took
it
by
contract
and
you
could
recover
it
in
the
court
of
claims,
but
if
they
took
it
without
contract,
and
took
it
for
public
use,
they
didn't
have
to
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
can't
be
decided
until
it
comes
up.
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
if
you
take
real
estate,
the
government
can
go
down
and
take
real
estate,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
it
in
advance,
but
if
it
doesn't
pay
for
it
a
suit
can
be
filed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
well
they
would
have
here.
