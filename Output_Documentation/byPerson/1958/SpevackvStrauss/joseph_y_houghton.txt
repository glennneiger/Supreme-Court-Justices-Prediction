mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
at
first
to
introduce
mr.
calvin
cobb
who
is
a
counsel
for
the
american
chemical
society,
amicus
in
this
case.
mr.
cobb
is
not
asking
to
address
the
court,
but
has
offered
to
answer
any
questions
that
might
come
up
about
the
amicus
brief
if
your
honors
should
have
any.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
no,
your
honor.
the
application
stands
allowed
in
the
patent
office
and
will
issue
when
the
final
fee
is
paid.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
time
limit
is,
at
the
present
time
under
the
statute
expires
may
25th.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
the
six
months
statutory
period
for
payment
of
the
final
fee
in
the
case.
under
the
law
the
issuance
of
the
patent
can
be
deferred
another
three
months
after
the
payment
of
the
final
fee,
but
the
patent
must
issue
within
three
months
after
the
payment
of
the
final
fee.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
no
that's
the
last
date
for
payment
of
the
final
fee.
there
would
be
three
months
after
that
date,
the
last
tuesday,
within
the
three
months
period,
when
we
run
--
the
patent
would
have
to
issue
under
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
would
be
in
august.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
is
patent
would
be
allowed?
the
first
indication
of
that
of
course
was
the
allowance
of
the
claims.
now
the
claims
were
allowed
and
at
that
time
there
were
several
other
matters
which
had
to
be
attended
to.
there
were
requirements
for
correction
of
the
drawings.
there
were
certain
other
procedural
matters
which
had
to
be
attended
to
and
those
matters
were
taken
care
of
and
finally
a
notice
of
allowance
was
issued
in
the
case.
the
first
notice
of
allowance
which
was
issued
was
defective.
we
called
that
properly
to
the
attention
of
the
patent
office,
and
in
response
to
that
in
due
course
they
issued
the
corrected
notice
of
allowance
under
which
the
final
fee
is
due
as
i
have
reported
to
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
not
so
far
as
the
us
patent
office
is
concerned,
your
honor.
we
have
a
peculiar
situation
which
is
that
one
foreign
country
in
which
we
have
filed
has
issued
a
secrecy
order.
we
are
strenuously
endeavoring
to
have
this
secrecy
order
rescinded
and
that
there
is
a
problem
as
to
whether
the
payment
of
the
fee
in
the
us
case
by
the
inventor
which
under
the
law
would
require
that
the
patent
issue
within
three
months,
whether
that
could
be
a
violation
of
this
secrecy
order
in
the
other
country.
now
i
should
mention
that
the
statute
also
does
provide
that
if
the
final
fee
is
not
paid
within
the
six
months
period,
which
expires
may
25th,
then
the
commissioner
of
patents
in
his
discretion
on
a
showing
of
good
reason
why,
may
accept
it
anytime
within
the
next
year
after
the
expiration
of
that
period.
we
know
of
no
precedent
as
to
whether
the
existence
of
a
secrecy
order
aboard
would
be
recognized
as
a
good
reason
under
this
act.
however,
we
have
asked
the
commissioner
of
patents
to,
if
possible,
give
us
some
sort
of
a
ruling
on
that
with
the
understanding
of
course
that
he
certainly
would
not
take
any
longer
to
may
29th
then
we
absolutely
had
to,
if
the
secrecy
order
could
not
be
disposed
off
before
that
time.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
we
certainly
hope
to
have
this
case
decided
before
we
pay
the
final
fee.
also
the
applicant
has
a
right
to
file
a
divisional
application
before
the
issuance
of
this
presently
allowed
application
on
certain
subject
matter
of
claims
that
were
not
--
that
are
not
in
the
allowed
claims
here.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
number
one
the
district
court
here
issued
certain
or
made
certain
findings
which
we
consider
very
damaging
to
the
interests
of
the
inventor,
particularly
with
respect
to
his
foreign
rights
in
certain
countries.
we
feel
it's
our
duty
to
try
to
get
this
ruling
which
we
consider
improper
by
the
district
court
reversed.
we
further
feel
that
as
a
matter
of
public
interest
and
as
a
matter
of
not
letting
down
the
party's
amici
curiae,
we
certainly
should
make
every
effort
to
have
what
we
consider
an
unconstitutional
interpretation
of
this
statute
reversed.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
it
will
not
affect
the
us
patent,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
what
we
are
worried
about
there
is
that
we
have
applied
for
patents
in
certain
foreign
countries.
now
in
some
of
those
foreign
countries
the
issuance,
i
mean,
the
occurrence
of
a
publication
anywhere
in
the
world
before
you
file
your
application
would
constitute
a
bar
to
obtain
you
a
valid
patent.
in
others
of
the
foreign
countries
the
issuance
of
patent
would
only
be
a
bar,
i
mean,
the
issuance
of
a
publication,
would
only
be
a
bar
to
the
grant
of
a
valid
patent
if
the
publication
occurred
in
the
country
concerned.
now
the
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
those
are
the
risks
that
a
person
applying
for
a
patent
who
has
not
been
impeded
by
government
edict,
ordinarily
does
take
in
this
instance,
and
of
course
the
international
convention
usually
provides
and
most
people
operate
under
it,
that
you
will
have
the
same
priority
right
in
the
foreign
country
as
you
would
in
the
home
country
if
you
filed
in
the
foreign
country
within
a
year.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
i
would
say
that
if
the
patent
issued
this
afternoon,
that
would
be
a
publication
by
the
petitioner,
as
such
it
would
substitute
the
protection
of
the
patent
grant
for
the
protection
of
the
trade
secret,
at
least
so
far
as
what's
in
the
patent
grant
is
concerned.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
i
could
visualize
that
there
would
be
a
very
strong
representation
by
the
opposing
counsel
that
it
had
become
moot.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
we
feel
that
we
need
to
attempt
to
get
this
and
here
is
what
is
consider
unconscionable
decisions
below
reversed.
also
of
course
as
i
have
mentioned
there
is
this
pending
secrecy
order
and
we
have
not
yet
been
able
to
obtain
assurance
that
the
petitioner
would
not
make
himself
liable
to
civil
and
criminal
penalties
in
the
country
concerned
if
you
want
to
have
him
pay
the
final
fee
in
the
united
states
and
cause
this
patent
to
be
published.
it's
very
--
the
law
in
the
country
concerned
is
quite
similar
to
the
us
secrecy
law
in
that
respect.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
yes.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
as
i
thought
--
as
i
was
trying
to
make
clear
your
honor,
the
claims
of
the
application
were
initially
allowed
before
the
formal
notice
of
allowance
was
issued
in
the
application.
this
formal
notice
of
allowance
is
a
printed
paper
which
calls
for
the
payment
of
the
final
fee
within
the
six
months
period
provided,
and
says
that
on
the
payment
of
the
fee
the
patent
will
issue
approximately
six
weeks
to
two
months
thereafter.
now,
the
claims
had
been
allowed
by
the
examiner,
but
in
the
action
which
allowed
them,
if
you
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
were
requirements
for
correction
of
the
drawings
which
had
been
made
early
in
the
prosecution
of
the
case,
that
had
been
differed
until
claims
should
be
allowed
and
also
that
there
were
other
requirements
for
illustration
of
certain
subject
matter
which
had
been
described,
but
had
not
been
illustrated
in
the
drawings.
now
those
were
formal
matters,
the
claims
were
allowed
but
these
formal
matters
had
to
be
corrected
before
the
examiner
would
issue
the
formal
notice
of
allowance
which
calls
for
the
payment
of
the
final
fee.
have
i
now
made
that
clear?
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
yes
justice
harlan
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
we
would
of
course
feel
much
happier
about
the
matter
if
the
court
here
decided
that
it
was
wrong.
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
of
course
i
think
it
seems
quite
evident
that
the
court
fully
understands
that
this
is
a
suit
to
restraint
the
respondents
from
exceeding
their
statutory
authority
by
publishing
the
petitioner's
trade
secret
without
his
consent.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
i
would
say
as
to
everything
disclosed
in
the
patent,
it
would
be
a
publication.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
is
correct
your
honors.
now
we
feel
that
the
issues
which
are
presented,
can
be
stated
more
--
which
are
--
i
will
tend
to
state
more
fully
following
the
brief
statement
of
the
facts,
because
the
primary
issues
comprised
these,
that's
whether
the
atomic
energy
act
authorizes
the
respondents
to
destroy
the
petitioner's
trade
secret
by
publishing
his
invention
which
forms
the
subject
matter
of
a
pending
patent
application.
now
that
is
a
matter
of
destroying
the
trade
secret.
second
is
whether
if
the
act
is
construed
to
so
authorize,
it
should
be
held
to
that
extent
to
be
unconstitutional.
now
the
facts
briefly
are
as
follows.
in
1942,
the
plaintiff
made
a
basic
or
a
prior
invention
and
this
dual
temperature
process
which
is
covered
by
an
issued
patent
and
that
earlier
invention,
the
respondents
have
perfect
liberty
to
publish
and
that's
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
it
was
after
june
1946,
while
he
was
self
employed
that
the
petitioner
made
the
invention,
which
is
involved
in
the
present
controversy
and
in
referring
to
it
i
will
try
to
refer
to
it
as
the
new
invention
so
as
to
distinguish
it
from
the
earlier
one.
this
new
invention,
the
petitioner
offered
to
disclose
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
in
confidence
in
1948
and
the
letter
by
which
that
offer
was
made
is
attached
as
appendix
i
to
the
brief
--
to
the
reply
brief
for
the
petitioner
which
was
just
filed
yesterday.
this
confidential
disclosure
was
of
course
made
i
should
say
pursuant
to
this
offer
in
1948,
the
confidential
disclosure
was
made
in
1949
and
of
course
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
enable
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
determine
whether
it
wished
to
use
the
process
for
the
production
of
heavy
water.
no
rights
in
the
invention
being
transferred
as
part
of
this
submission.
the
atomic
energy
commission
then
did
decide
to
use
the
new
invention
for
the
production
of
heavy
water.
and
from
1950
to
1953,
the
petitioner
rendered
services
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
under
special
contracts
which
reserved
his
rights
to
the
invention
in
controversy,
and
which
provided
that
he
would
file
a
patent
application
for
the
invention,
which
he
did.
now
that
application
was
put
under
a
secrecy
order
by
the
patent
office
at
the
instance
of
the
atomic
energy
commission.
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
also
refused
to
allow
the
secrecy
order
to
be
modified,
so
that
the
inventor
could
file
corresponding
applications
abroad.
that
situation
adhered
until
february
1,
1957.
on
february
1,
1957
the
secrecy
order
was
rescinded
and
at
the
same
time
the
atomic
energy
commission
threatened
to
publish
the
subject
matter.
we
maintain
that
this
subject
matter
is
petitioner's
trade
secret
up
until
the
time
that
patent
issues.
the
petitioner
at
once
sought
assurances
that
the
publication
would
not
be
made,
but
he
could
not
obtain
such
assurances.
he
filed
this
suit
to
prevent
the
respondents
from
destroying
his
property
by
publishing
his
trade
secret.
the
district
court
in
proceedings
on
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
overruled
respondent's
contention
that
this
was
an
unconsented
suit
against
the
government.
however,
based
on
affidavits
of
certain
alleged
disseminations
which
are
produced
by
the
respondents,
the
district
court
did
deny
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
on
the
ground
of
mootness.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
point
of
mootness.
it
ruled
that
the
atomic
energy
act
authorized
the
respondents
to
make
this
publication
and
that
therefore
the
contract
did
not
--
and
it
also
mentioned
that
the
complaint
had
not
set
out
in
its
opinion
the
statutory
limitations
which
denied
such
authority
and
on
that
basis
it
ordered
the
case
to
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
petitioner
moved
to
amend
the
complaint
to
specify
statutory
limitations
and
also
to
specify
the
presence
of
a
constitutional
issue.
now
this
motion
was
denied
and
we
came
up
for
the
first
time
to
this
court.
in
the
per
curiam
in
december
1957
this
court
granted
certiorari,
vacated
the
judgment
and
orders
below
and
remanded
the
case
with
instructions
to
enter
the
amendments
and
decide
the
issues
raised
by
the
petitioners
appeal.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
again
held
that
the
atomic
energy
act
authorized
the
publication
and
further
held
that
the
constitution
didn't
forbid
this,
and
then
directed
that
the
amended
complaint
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
on
which
relief
could
be
granted.
now
we
maintain
that
the
instant
certiorari
was
granted
to
review
these
rulings
and
also
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
which
was
not
reached
by
the
court
below.
the
petitioner's
first
contention,
which
i
will
discuss
after
i
mention
the
others,
is
that
the
respondents
do
not
have
the
statutory
authority
to
publish
the
plaintiff's
trade
secret
without
his
consent.
there
are
three
points
on
that
which
i
will
not
enumerate
until
i
get
to
that
part
of
the
discussion.
our
second
contention,
which
mr.
edwards
will
discuss,
is
that
the
district
court
ruling
of
mootness
was
improper
and
was
not
established
by
the
evidence.
these
above
issues
of
course
are
raised
by
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
as
granted
and
hence
are
in
our
opinion
properly
before
the
court.
it
appears
to
us
from
the
respondents'
brief
that
the
respondents
have
abandoned
the
position
that
they
have
statutory
authority
to
publish
this
subject
matter
with
or
without
the
petitioner's
consent,
which
they
urged
always
previously
heretofore
and
now
are
attempting
to
rely
or
attempting
to
raise
a
new
issue
on
the
proposition
that
somehow
they
are
trying
to
find
an
implied
consent
to
this
publication.
of
course
they
have
tried
to
rely
on
an
implied
contract,
of
course
there
was
an
implied
contract,
that
they
could
use
this
matter,
subject
to
compensation
as
far
as
the
use
was
concerned,
but
that's
a
different
thing
from
destroying
the
trade
secret
which
is
the
subject
of
the
contract
up
to
the
time
when
a
patent
they
issue.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
there
is,
i
possibly
shouldn't
have
used
the
word
implied
contract
your
honor,
there
is
a
contract,
some
of
the
provisions
of
which
are
express
and
from
which
other
provisions
might
be
implied.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
yes
and
that's
a
part
of
the
case
which
we
maintain
is
a
--
the
contracts
were
not
in
the
record,
no
your
honor.
these
contracts
some
of
them
have
been
lodged
with
the
clerk
by
the
respondents
since
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
the
situation
as
we
see
it
is
this.
first,
we
believe
that
under
the
rules
of
this
court,
this
whole
new
contention,
this
whole
new
issue
that
the
respondents
are
attempting
to
raise
is
not
properly
here.
now
mr.
edwards
is
prepared
to
go
into
that
at
considerable
length
and
i
think
that
if
it's
agreeable
with
your
honor
maybe
he
could
answer
that
question
better
than
i
can.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
we
say
the
question
is
not
in
the
case.
i
presume
that
under
the
rules
that
this
court
considered
that
it
was
a
matter
of
plain
error.
the
court
could
pay
attention
to
it.
we
do
not
feel
that
this
sort
of
thing,
producing
new
documents
or
documents
which
could
have
been
produced
below
and
never
were
produced
for
the
edification
of
the
trial
judge,
we
think
that
this
wholly
improper
and
contrary
to
the
rules
and
that
it
should
be
fully
--
completely
disregarded.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well,
the
situation
seems
to
me,
i
don't
want
to
infringe
on
what
mr.
edwards
is
prepared
to
discuss
in
more
detail
from
a
legalistic
standpoint,
but
the
situation
seems
to
me
to
be
this.
there
are
three
ways
in
which
the
government
or
government
official
can
get
information
in
confidence.
one
way
is
from
the
inspection
of
a
patent
application
under
the
secrecy
act.
when
that's
done,
the
respondents
now
come
along
here
and
they
say
we
don't
claim
now
and
they
pretend
that
they
never
claimed
before,
that
they
would
have
any
right
to
publish
it
if
they
got
it
that
way.
another
way
is
if
the
act,
the
atomic
energy
act
or
other
appropriate
act
called
for
a
report
to
be
made
of
the
invention.
the
respondents
in
their
brief
now
come
along
and
they
say,
we
don't
say
that
we
have
any
right
to
publish
under
those
circumstances,
yes
we
would
get
it
under
confidence
then
and
then
they
pretend
that
they
never
heard
to
the
contrary
below,
well
we
contend
that
they
did
urge
to
the
contrary
below
and
even
up
before
this
court,
that
is
pretty
fully
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief.
now
the
third
way
they
can
get
the
subject
matter
and
it
will
be
noted
that
also
in
connection
with
getting
it
from
inspection
of
a
patent
application,
but
that
law
sort
of
--
that
secrecy
law
rather
adds
to
the
old
patent
infringement
so
called
jurisdiction
or
patent
eminent
may
license
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims,
which
adhered
only
when
one
the
subject
matter
was
used
by
or
for
the
government
after
the
patent
issued.
now
under
the
secrecy
act
it
carries
the
time
when
the
government
may
look
upon
the
--
and
then
it
may
look
to
the
government
for
compensation
for
use,
back
to
the
time
when
the
government
got
access
to
this
application
and
got
it
that
way
as
a
trade
secret.
and
i
believe
there
are
cases,
one
of
them
is
the
smith
case
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
which
have
held
that
a
patent
--
that
an
invention
remains
a
trade
secret
throughout
the
pendency
of
the
application
for
patent
on
it.
now
the
third
way
that
it
can
be
gotten
is
for
the
inventor
who
or
owner
of
the
trade
secret
to
disclose
it
under
some
sort
of
a
contract
to
the
recipient
of
the
disclosure.
in
this
case
the
disclosure
was
to
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
trade
secret
to
be
used
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
for
the
prevention
of
heavy
water.
and
certainly
didn't
contemplate
destruction
of
the
trade
secret,
because
if
you
destroy
--
it
wouldn't
be
any
point
to
making
a
contract
with
respect
to
subject
matter
which
was
convey
immediately
the
right
to
destroy
the
subject
matter
under
which
the
contract
was
made.
recall
that
until
a
pattern
issues
to
take
the
place
of
your
trade
secret
the
only
rights
that
an
inventor
has
are
his
rights
of
secrecy,
in
this
country.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
whether
those
--
whether
the
right
to
use
this
as
obtained
under
the
patent
act
secrecy
provisions,
or
whether
it's
obtained
under
a
reporting
provision
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
or
whether
its
obtained
through
a
patriotic
presentation
of
the
subject
matter
with
a
reservation
of
full
patent
or
full
rights
in
the
subject
matter
by
a
citizen
is
completely
immaterial
so
far
as
any
right
to
publish
and
destroy
the
race
of
the
contract
is
concerned,
do
i
make
that
point
clear?
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
now
i
would
prefer
to
have
and
go
forward
beyond
that
with
the
authorities
and
so
forth.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
now
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
now
in
the
first
place
these
contracts
never
called
this
inventor
an
employee.
this
inventor
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
this
inventor
in
the
early
contracts
was
an
independent
contractor
and
was
so
identified
and
his
things
he
was
supposed
to
do
were
very
carefully
identified
and
the
early
contracts
and
particularly
the
res
gestae
surrounding
them
showed
that
he
had
reserved
all
of
his
rights
in
his
invention.
now
the
right
to
preserve
his
foreign
rights
by
not
having
a
premature
publication
is
one
of
those
rights.
the
right
to
preserve
his
freedom
to
negotiate
for
the
use
or
for
the
commercial
use
of
his
trade
secret
is
another
one
of
the
important
and
valuable
assets
that
attach
to
making
this
intellectual
property
contribution.
so
that
was
the
first
thing.
now
secondly
the
idea
was
that
this
would
be
used
subject
to
a
reservation
of
all
his
rights,
and
then
this
contract
was
entered
into
which
called
him
a
contractor
not
an
employee,
and
similarly
the
later
contracts
after
the
government
had
decided
that
they
did
wish
to
use
the
subject
matter
of
this
application,
this
trade
secret,
in
the
production
of
heavy
water,
the
later
ones
each
carefully
reserved
all
the
rights,
had
the
usual
clause
that
if
the
inventor
makes
new
inventions
during
the
course
of
this
contract
as
a
part
of
his
assigned
duties,
those
along
to
the
government,
but
that
as
to
all
of
the
earlier
inventions
which
he
has
made
any
rights
that
he
had
with
respect
to
them
and
that's
any
rights
with
respect
to
them
are
reserved.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
they
wish
to
publish
certain
manuals
as
to
the
system
used
in
the
class.
now
this
system
embodies
the
invention
of
the
present,
that's
now
in
controversy
here.
this
original
--
the
original,
what
i
call
the
earlier
invention,
wasn't
economically
too
attractive.
it
was
operable.
it
showed
how
to
apply
principals
in
a
different
way
to
obtain
a
different
result,
but
it
wasn't
economically
very
attractive
and
it
was
not
enough,
not
attractive
enough
to
awake
any
very
great
interest
by
the
atomic
energy
commission,
although
it
was
assigned
to
the
office
scientific
research
and
development.
now,
after
1946,
when
mr.
spevack
was
no
longer
employed
by
the
government,
he
got
thinking
about
this
problem
and
he
had,
had
some
faith
in
this
thing
and
he
made
--
he
finally
figured
out
how
to
make
this
thing
really
economically
attractive.
and
at
that
time
he
came
back
to
the
aec
as
shown
by
the
letter
printed
in
our
--
at
the
end
of
our
reply
brief,
he
came
back
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
he
says
look,
this
thing
is
going
to
be
much
better
than
any
of
the
other
ways
you
have
available
to
make
heavy
water.
now
i
would
like
to
be
compensated
some
for
my
time
in
preparing
full
analysis
of
this
thing
for
you,
but
it
seems
to
--
but
i
will
do
it,
i'll
do
it
on
my
time
if
you
don't
feel
like
compensating
me
for
my
time,
but
it's
understood
that
nothing
is
--
nothing
that
i
disclose
to
you,
i'm
not
giving
up
any
rights,
you
know.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
sort
of
arrangement,
he
did
demonstrate
to
the
government
that
this
system,
this
new
system,
did
make
this
economically
very
much
superior
to
any
other
way
of
doing
the
job,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
it
was
adopted
for
the
government
plans.
and
as
long
as
the
trade
secret
is
maintained,
as
long
as
it
was
used
in
confidence
in
those
plans
we
have
no
objection
because
we
have
reserved
rights
to
compensation
for
that.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
the
euratom?
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
it
is
that
the
euratom
treaty?
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
the
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
because
the
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
our
treaties,
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
main
brief
i
believe
it
is,
our
treaties
with
these
various
other
countries,
most
of
which
in
this
particular
field
were
negotiated
by
the
atomic
energy
commission,
specifically
say
that
it
is
not
required
that
anything
be
disclosed
to
the
other
country
which
the
government
has
no
right
to
disclose
because
it
is
privately
owned.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
that's
the
substantially,
yes
your
honor.
now
i
think
the
court
has
seemed
to
be
so
very
familiar
with
the
whole
circumstances
here
and
the
question
seemed
to
be
going
more
toward
this
or
seem
to
have
gone
toward
this
point
of
new
issue
and
i
believe
in
order
to
allow
time
for
my
other
counsel
here
to
treat
that
i
should
close
at
this
point.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
the
question
of
this
adequate
remedy
at
law
as
i
see
it
comes
down
to
two
things.
if
you
have
a
contract
and
there
is
a
breach
of
that
contract
or
if
you
have
a
contract
and
there
is
a
provision
for
a
promise
to
pay
in
that
contract,
on
the
part
of
the
government
agent
who
is
authorized
by
the
statute
to
do
the
act
in
question,
then
or
if
he
is
authorized
by
an
eminent
domain
statute,
then
you
of
course
have
a
cause
of
action
in
the
court
of
claims
as
long
as
the
act
done
does
not
sound
in
tort.
now
if
the
act
done
is
not
authorized
by
statute
or
an
eminent,
that
is
an
eminent
to
main
statute
or
by
a
contract
consent
then
of
course
it
would
sound
in
tort,
and
it
wouldn't
be
actionable.
now
it
comes
of
the
other
fact
that
we
have
the
tort
claims
act
in
which
for
certain
times
in
torts
the
government
says
yes
it
will
be
liable
and
consent
to
be
sued,
but
that
isn't
this
sort
of
a
situation.
now
also
here
we
have
the
further
fact
that
an
invention
like
a
copyright,
like
a
writing,
this
is
an
intellectual
property,
you
have
rights
as
long
as
you
keep
it
secret
to
get
patents,
in
various
places
for
it.
it's
unique,
once
it's
disclosed
the
trade
secret
is
gone.
once
it's
disclosed
your
right
to
get
patents
in
certain
countries
is
gone,
once
it's
disclosed
in
certain
countries
your
right
--
certain
other
countries
your
right
to
get
patents
there
is
gone.
so
this
is
a
very
unique
thing,
this
trade
secret
and
none
of
the
cases
which
have
been
cited,
we
haven't
found
a
single
case
where
there
has
ever
been
a
ruling
that
the
--
that
there
is
any
statutory
--
any
eminent
domain
--
contemplation
of
any
eminent
domain
taking
for
example
of
the
right
to
destroy
the
very
thing
taken,
the
trade
secret.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
but
that's
the
prerogative
of
the
inventor.
he
at
that
time
has
negotiated
you
might
say
with
the
patent
office
on
behalf
of
the
government,
on
this
basis
that
if
you
will
give
up
your
trade
secret
by
issuing
your
patent,
we
will
then
give
you
17
years
exclusive
monopoly
in
exchange
for
it.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
also
in
foreign
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
it
will
no
longer
be
protected
as
far
as
foreign
countries
are
concerned
after
that.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that's
not
the
whole
basis
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
is
one
of
the
results.
the
other
result
would
be
this,
that
as
long
as
the
us
application
remains
pending,
as
long
as
we
haven't
published
this
subject
matter,
the
inventor
has
trade
secret
property
which
he
can
sell
to
somebody,
which
he
can
negotiate
for
the
promotion
of.
now
as
soon
as
he
issues
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
if
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
now
the
agreements
between
the
parties
never
said
anything
about
foreign
rights
whatsoever.
the
agreements
merely
said
that
mr.
spevack
reserved
all
of
his
rights
which
were
the
right
of
secrecy
until
his
patent
should
issue
at
his
own
volition.
he
pays
the
final
fee
which
causes
it
to
issue
it,
as
i
think
was
brought
out
earlier
in
the
argument.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
it
will
do
damage
abroad,
but
it
will
also
do
damage
with
respect
to
mr.
spevack's
ability
to
negotiate
for
the
promotion
of
his
trade
secret
and
the
trade
secret
remember
maybe
broader.
the
trade
secret
maybe
broader,
the
things
that
people
would
like
to
learn
about
this,
maybe
broader
than
what
is
determined
or
covered
by
the
claims
of
the
first
issued
patent.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
i
believe
that's
a
correct
proposition
your
honor
which
would
be
the
necessary
or
ancillary
result
to
this
matter
that
we
have
here
in
the
controversy.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
well
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
now
we
consider
that,
that
does
comes,
that
is
one
of
the
unique
rights
which
once
lost
can
never
be
recovered
and
that's
why
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
right
to
damages
for
alleged
breach
of
contract
or
something
is
adequate.
there
is
not
an
adequate
remedy
of
law
for
the
loss
of
a
unique
right.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
y.
houghton
that
is
correct
your
honor.
well
i
thank
you
very
kindly
and
will
allow
mr.
edwards
to
go.
