petitioner
versus
lewis
l.
strauss
et
al.
mr.
houghton
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
anything
remain
now
except
the
payment
of
the
fee
as
a
requirement
for
the
issuance
of
the
patent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
edwards.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sands.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
patent
office
deny
his
patent
because
it
didn't
think
he
had
anything
patentable
or
denied
because
it
had
been
put
under
the
secrecy
order
by
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
anything
to
do
with
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
they
finally
allowed
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
the
â€“
why
do
you
think
that
they
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
want
you
to
send
us
copies,
present
copies
of
that
court
order.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand
just
the
fact
that
he
has
a
statutory
right
to
do
this
(inaudible)
whether
he
has
the
right
to
wait
until
the
end
of
that
time
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
still
on
for
a
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
very
frank
about
that.
he
told
us
that
he
was
holding
that
for
that
very
reason
and
he
could
file
his
patent
so
he
told
us
that
there
was
another,
it
was
one
of
the
countries
that
wouldn't
issue
a
pattern
and
he
did
it
before.
and
furthermore
he
said
the
--
he
wanted
to
use
the
time
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
him
to
finance
these
things
that
every
inventor
doesn't
have
the
money
to
finance
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
that
any
aspersion
is
cast
upon
him
or
--.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
misusing
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
edwards.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
what
would
you
get
actually
from
a
judgment,
the
judgment
that
you
seek
here,
that
you
could
not
get
if
you
are
given
until
the
25th
of
may,
to
pay,
make
your
payment
to
the
patent
office
and
thereafter
the
case
was
mooted
by
vacating
the
judgments
below.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
get
no
financial
advantage
by
going
through
the
rest
of
this
litigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
another
law
suit,
isn't
that
something
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
we
vacate
the
judgments
below,
there
will
be
no
decision
against
you
anyway,
will
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
only
thing
you
would
be
losing
would
be
an
affirmative
statement
of
principles
by
this
court
for
future
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
the
government
wouldn't
want
to
prejudice
you
in
that
respect
would
it,
it
wouldn't
be
any
advantage
to
them
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
does
mr.
spevack
want
the
results
of
this
lawsuit
because
he
wanted
principles
for
the
future
established,
quickly
what
are
you
arguing
for
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
think
i
understand
that,
i
wonder
if
--
i
might
ask
without
calling
for
any
argument
from
counsel
for
the
american
chemical
society
because
he
represents
so
many
sides,
if
any,
if
the
vacation
of
this,
of
this
suit
as
being
--
the
vacation
of
the
decision
below
is
being
moot
would
it
adversely
affect
the
interest
of
the
scientists?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
conceded
that
now,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
suppose
if
those
decisions
were
wiped
out
by
being
vacated,
you
would
have
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
