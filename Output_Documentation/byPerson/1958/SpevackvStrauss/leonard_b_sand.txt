mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
learned
for
the
first
time
in
the
past
hour
when
it
is
that
the
date
--
when
it
is
that
the
petitioner
must
pay
his
patent
fee.
the
dates
of
allowance
are
confidential
as
between
the
patent
office
and
the
applicant.
and
so
we
have
not
known
the
precise
date
until
this
time,
although
we
did
know
that
at
the
time
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
there
was
a
statement
that
all
the
claims
had
been
allowed.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
once
the
patent
is
issued
this
case
becomes
moot.
the
compliant
sought
an
injunction
only
until
such
time
as
a
patent
would
issue.
the
petitioner
is
seeking
injunctive
relief.
he
must
therefore
show
that
he
has
a
need
for
that
extraordinary
remedy.
yet
far
from
showing
such
need,
he
has
--
it
has
been
stated
to
this
court
that
the
patent
fee
is
not
being
paid
for
the
very
purpose
of
preserving
this
litigation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
not
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
he
is
seeking
to
enjoin
the
atomic
energy
commission
from
fulfilling
its
statutory
obligations
to
disseminate
to
the
free
world
and
to
the
scientific
community
the
technology
with
respect
to
atomic
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that's
correct,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
i
think
that
it's
true,
that
under
the
atomic
energy
act
there
is
an
obligation
imposed
upon
the
commission
to
declassify
data,
to
disseminate
it
to
the
world.
i
think
that
it
is
clear,
it
has
in
fact
happened
as
a
result
of
temporary
restraining
orders
issued
in
this
case
that
the
united
states
has
not
been
able
to
participate
fully
with
other
countries,
pursuant
to
president
eisenhower's
atoms
for
peace
program,
pursuant
to
the
oec
program,
because
of
the
restraint
which
has
been
imposed
as
a
result
of
this
litigation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
know
of
no
such
provision,
no
such
provision
in
the
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
statute
with
respect
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
oh
no,
there
are
provisions
in
our
treaties
with
foreign
countries
which
--
in
which
we
reserve
the
right
not
to
divulge
certain
information,
but
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
i
think
not,
because
our
contention
is
that,
that
as
between
mr.
spevack
and
the
atomic
energy
commission,
there
is
no
such
obligation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
because
of
the
arrangement
between
us,
because
we
learned
of
his
secret
not
by
virtue
of
any
patent
application,
not
by
virtue
of
any
statutory
reporting
provisions,
we
learned
of
his
invention
because
we
paid
him
to
tell
it
to
us.
and
we
paid
him
to
tell
it
to
us
for
the
very
purpose
of
incorporating
his
improvement
along
with
the
basic
commission
owned
process
in
government
plans
which
cost
over
$100
million
to
build.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
findings,
well
the
findings
of
the
district
court
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
pardon,
they
appear
on
page
18
of
the
joint
appendix.
it's
which
is
--
can
i
help
you?
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it's
part
of
the
record
i'm
told
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
it
is
impounded,
it
contains
no
statement
that
is
not
in
our
brief
which
is
not
impounded
and
so
i
see
no
reason
why
i
can't
read
it
to
the
court.
three,
is
material
covered
in
the
patent
application,
was
reported
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
by
the
plaintiff
in
a
report
dated
october
25,
1949
and
the
contract
between
plaintiffs
and
the
defendant.
so
there
is
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
we
learned
of
his
process,
of
the
in-truth
process
by
virtue
of
a
contract
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
that's
all
that
appears
in
the
formal
findings
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
i
--
one
need
only
look
to
the
compliant
and
in
the
complaint
itself
petitioner
concedes
that
he
disclose
the
improvement
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
pursuant
to
these
contracts.
i
think
that's
undisputed.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
in
the
complaint
he
alleges
that
he
reserved
rights
and
that
is
all.
it
is
merely
that
conclusory
allegation
that
he
reserved
rights.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
what
appears
in
the
record
is
as
follows.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
finding
--
well,
i
think
there
is
no
finding
more
specific
than
the
one
to
which
i
have
called
the
attention
of
the
court
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
disclosure
pursuant
to
the
contract
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
contract
itself
was
not
before
the
district
court.
in
the
preliminary
hearing
the
contents
of
the
contracts
were
summarized
to
the
court.
the
court
was
told
about
them.
it's
been
no
surprise
in
this
litigation
that
these
contracts
exist.
the
precise
terms
of
the
contract,
the
precise
contracts
themselves
were
not
made
part
of
the
record.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
government's
argument
that
it
has
been
authorized
to
make
this
publication,
that
petitioner
has
not
reserved
to
himself
the
right
to
control
the
dissemination
of
this
information,
we
base
on
matters
which
appear
in
the
formal
record,
the
record
which
is
before
this
court
and
is
before
the
lower
courts
and
our
brief
is
predicated
solely
upon
material
which
appears
in
the
formal
record.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
could
have.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
burden
is
on
him,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
he
is
seeking
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
injunctive
relief
which
has
these
serious
public
consequences.
he
concedes
in
his
complaint
and
elsewhere,
that
he
disclosed
this
improvement
to
the
united
states
under
contract.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
united
states
with
his
participation
as
a
consultant,
embodied
this
improvement
in
the
government
plants,
which
the
government
itself
constructed
as
i
say
of
course
with
several
hundred
million
dollars.
he
is
(inaudible),
i
have
reserved
the
power
to
say
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
that
it
cannot
tell
our
allies
how
heavy
water
is
made
in
these
commission
owned
plants,
because
i
have
reserved
that
power,
it's
true
i
told
you
about
this
improvement.
i
assisted
you
and
participated
with
you
in
the
commingling
of
this
improvement
with
the
basic
commission
owned
process,
but
i
reserve
the
power
to
control
the
dissemination
of
information
with
respect
thereto
and
we
say,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
say
that
the
burden
is
on
him
as
the
party
seeking
to
invoke
the
equity
powers
of
the
court
and
an
injunction
to
show
where
he
has
reserved
that
power
and
that
the
mere
conclusory
allegation,
i
reserved
my
rights,
which
is
a
matter
of
patent
law
as
construed
to
mean
reserved
rights
to
monetary
compensation
and
no
more,
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
concede
mr.
justice
black
in
this
court
as
we
have
in
the
court
below,
that
petitioner
has
reserved
to
himself
and
that
we
will
be
obligated
to
him
for
just
compensation,
if
in
fact
he
has
a
patentable
improvement
which
we
have
used,
we
concede
that.
we
conceded
that
below
and
we
say
when
he
said
in
his
complaint
and
when
he
said
in
his
contracts
i
reserved
my
rights,
what
he
is
talking
about
is
his
right
to
compensation
and
if
it
is
something
more,
if
it's
this
extraordinary
power
to
say
to
the
atomic
energy
commission,
you
can't
even
let
anybody
into
this
plant,
certainly
so
extraordinary
a
reservation
of
power
which
flies
so
much
in
the
face
of
the
statutory
obligations
imposed
upon
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
disseminate
technology,
it
must
be
spelled
out,
there
must
be
something
more
than
i
reserved
my
rights.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
plants,
the
building
in
which
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
in
the
plant,
heavy
water
is
made.
it
is
made
under
a
basic
process
which
is
owned
by
the
commission.
it
is
made
also
--
in
the
process
there
is
utilized
an
improvement
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
dispute,
we
cannot
tell
obc,
although
they've
asked
us,
we
cannot
tell
them
how
we
make
heavy
water,
as
long
as
we
are
subject
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
cannot
tell
how
we
presently
make
heavy
water
without
telling
what
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
between
now
and
may
25,
would
now
and
the
time
the
patent
issues,
i
wish
to
direct
myself
that
because
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
i
thought
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
he
has
a
patentable
improvement
and
he
has
not
given
us
the
right
to
disseminate
â€“
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
he
has
preserved
that
right
and
we
in
fact,
as
we
want
to
do,
disseminate
it,
that
this
would
give
him
a
cause
of
action
in
a
court
of
claims,
either
for
breach
of
contract
or
for
a
taking
or
for
a
contract
implied
in
fact.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes
we
--
another
complete
answer
to
this
case
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
he
has
that
statutory
right,
but
he
is
a
plaintiff
in
a
court
of
equity
asking
for
an
injunction.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
brings
me
to
what
--
but
i
agree
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
had
intended
to
devout
the
major
portion
of
my
argument
to
just
that
point
and
because
i
think
a
chronology
will
indicate
what
in
fact
are
the
issues
of
this
case?
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
stated,
the
basic
process
which
he
invented
is
owned
by
the
commission,
there
is
not
question
as
to
that.
in
december
1956,
the
atomic
energy
commission
announced
that
it
wanted
to
declassify
information
with
respect
to
heavy
water,
so
that
all
persons
interested
in
this
field
knew
from
that
time
on,
that
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
foreign
patents
would
soon
be
on
hand.
on
february
1,
1957,
the
secrecy
orders
which
theretofore
had
applied
to
these
patent
applications
were
rescinded
and
so
petitioner
has
had
over
two
years
since
february
1,
1957,
to
apply
for
his
foreign
patent
rights.
indeed
shortly
after
the
lifting
of
the
secrecy
order
on
march
30,
1957,
counsel
for
petitioner
wrote
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
asked
that
there
be
a
delay
in
the
dissemination,
and
that
letter
is
attached
to
the
complaint.
the
basic
complaint
that
was
made,
the
basic
plea
that
was
made
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
was,
that
had
there
never
been
any
secrecy
restrictions,
petitioner
would
have
had
one
year
after
he
filed
his
domestic
patent
application,
within
which
he
could
apply
in
foreign
countries
and
be
subject
to
certain
priorities
and
protections
under
the
international
convention.
we
don't
hear,
and
this
was
the
basic
theory
of
the
complaint,
i'm
entitled
to
one
year
after
i
file
my
patent
application,
under
the
treaties
you
have
prevented
me
from
availing
myself
that
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
patent
application
was
filed
on
september
29,
1950.
on
october
30,
1950
the
secrecy
order
went
into
effect
and
the
secrecy
order
precluded
the
filing
of
foreign
patent
applications.
february
1,
1957
the
secrecy
order
was
lifted,
from
that
time
on
petitioner
has
been
free
to
file
in
the
foreign
countries.
we
hear
no
more
or
we
hear
little
about
the
one
year
period
under
the
convention
now
for
simple
reason
that
petitioner
has
had
over
two
years,
which
i
submit
is
also
a
fact
of
which
in
and
of
itself
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
in
this
letter
which
is
attached
to
complaint,
counsel
for
petitioner
stated
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
that
the
patent
would
issue
within
the
next
few
months.
this
is
in
march
1957.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
whole
theory
as
reflected
in
the
complaint
was
this.
had
there
been
no
secrecy
order,
and
i
file
my
domestic
patent
application,
under
the
convention
for
the
protection
of
industrial
property
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
there
is
a
period
of
one
year
in
which
he
may
file
in
foreign
countries
and
not
be
subject
to
the
objection
of
a
prior
publication.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
lost.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
is
one
--
that's
right,
it
would
be
one
year
that
from
september
29,
1950
when
he
filed
his
domestic
patent.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
said
â€“
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
his
plea
for
equity
or
his
plea
restraint
on
the
part
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
was,
by
your
action
in
imposing
the
secrecy
order,
you
have
deprived
me
of
the
one
year
which
i
would
have
under
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
in
that
letter
he
said,
it's
only
a
matter
of
a
few
months.
in
june
1957
when
petitioner
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
there
was
some
colloquy
prior
to
that
time,
judge
berger
asked
the
counsel
for
petitioner
how
long
do
you
want
and
counsel
stated
one
year
would
be
preferred
or
required.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
would
be
preferred
or
required.
this
was
what
was
said
to
the
court.
well,
it's
now
march
of
1959.
in
response
to
this
request
for
a
delay,
in
which
it
was
said
that
the
patent
would
issue
in
a
few
months,
the
atomic
energy
commission
grant
â€“
they
said
that
they
would
grant
perhaps
30
days,
they
said,
it
appears
at
page
74
of
the
record
that
we
assume
that
you
will
immediately
take
steps
to
obtain
the
foreign
patents
and
that
an
additional
delay
of
perhaps
30
days
would
be
adequate
to
protect
mr.
spevack's
interest.
this
was
in
response
to
the
representation
that
was
made
in
the
letter
to
the
atomic
energy
commission,
that
it
was
just
a
matter
of
a
few
months
before
the
patent
would
issue.
on
april
10,
1957
the
complaint
for
injunctive
relief
was
filed
and
as
i
say
the
basic
theory
was
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
the
one
year.
and
in
that
compliant,
petitioner
alleges
that
since
february
1,
1957,
plaintiff
has
taken
definite
steps
as
rapidly
as
he
is
able
to
do
so
towards
making
applications
for
foreign
patents,
and
the
injunction
that
was
sought
was
until
such
time
as
their
patent
would
issue,
which
brings
us
to
march
of
1959
and
before
this
court.
the
information
has
been
declassified
for
a
period
of
27
months.
the
one
year
period
of
the
convention
has
long
since
expired.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
did
not
and
congress
when
it
passed
the
invention
secrecy
act
specifically
recognized
that
as
a
result
of
the
passage
of
that
act,
inventors
would
be
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
the
convention
and
other
provisions
were
made
in
the
statue
to
compensate
persons
for
that
loss,
it
does
not
happen
to
apply
to
--
let
me
finish
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
does
not
have
a
claim
for
equitable
relief.
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
correct.
now
i
don't
want
to
overstate.
he
phrased
his
request,
his
prayer,
that
he
be
granted
such
time
as
he
may
file
his
patent
applications
in
so
many
of
the
104
patent
issuing
countries
of
the
world
as
he
deems
it
feasible.
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
told
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
june
of
1957,
that
is
correct,
and
now
he
says
that
well
my
day
for
paying
the
fee
is
may
25,
he
does
not
say
to
this
court
i
am
going
to
pay
the
fee
on
may
25.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
he
will
not
the
pay
fee
on
may
25th,
that
he
will
seek
to
engage
in
further
(inaudible).
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no
do
we
have
authority
to
pay
it
before.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
does
have
authority
to
extent
the
year.
it
has
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
$30
and
this
appears
on
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
$
1
for
each
claim
in
excess
of
20.
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
brennan
is
under
35
usc
151,
the
fee
is
payable
not
later
than
six
months
after
allowance.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
which
would
be
may
25,
now
the
commissioner
of
patents
may
accept
for
good
cause
shown
a
late
filing
up
until
one
year
after
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
after
--
up
to
one
year
late,
which
would
be
one
year
from
the
allowance,
one
year
from
the
date
of
allowance.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
date
of
allowance
is
november
25.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
anderson
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
of
course,
for
six
years.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
been
over
two
years
since
that's
been
lifted.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
during
that
time
to
the
extent
that
we
have
been
using
his
patentable
improvement,
if
it
is
such,
we
have
been
using
it
and
we
agree
and
concede
without
qualification
that
if
he
has
a
patentable
improvement
and
we've
been
using
it,
he
is
entitled
to
just
compensation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
had
been
able
to
apply
abroad
since
february
1,
1957.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
have
to
bring
some
additional
facts
into
the
case
because
the
answer
is
no
mr.
justice
black,
but
not
because
of
anything
that
the
respondents
have
done.
under
the
invention
secrecy
act,
which
is
in
35
u.s.c.,
an
inventor
is
entitled
to
compensation,
if
he
is
precluded
from
filing
foreign
patent
applications
as
a
result
of
the
secrecy
order.
that
cause
of
action
accrues
as
of
the
time
his
patent
is
allowed,
as
of
the
time
the
patent
office
says
to
him
you
have
an
allowable
patent.
even
though
the
secrecy
order
was
imposed,
the
patent
office
continues
to
process
the
patent
application.
well
now
what
happens
in
this
case
and
this
case
is
the
sport
in
this
respect,
when
petitioner
filed
his
patent
application
in
september
1950,
the
patent
office
denied
it.
they
did
not
allow
it
and
in
fact
it
was
not
allowed
by
the
patent
office
until
sometime
subsequent
to
the
lifting
of
the
secrecy
order.
and
so
we
did
not
prevent
him
from
--
the
secrecy
order
did
not
prevent
him
from
getting
his
patent
up
until
the
time
the
patent
office
allowed
it.
that's
something
peculiar
to
this
case.
it
does
not
affect
the
general
rights
of
inventors.
the
fact
is
that
congress
has
recognized
in
the
secrecy
act
that
inventors
may
lose
certain
rights
as
a
result
of
the
imposition
of
a
secrecy,
of
the
secrecy
order
and
congress
has
provided
a
mechanism
for
providing
just
compensation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
oh
well
no,
i
don't
know
the
exact
grounds.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
secrecy
order
had
nothing
to
do
with
allowance,
the
patent
office
goes
ahead
and
processes
the
patent
application
as
if
there
had
been
no
secrecy
order.
the
secrecy
order
is
not
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
oh
disallowed
under
merits,
there
was
an
appeal,
currently
it
has
been
allowed.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
they
finally
allowed
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
a
bill
for
the
release
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
i
say
then
on
behalf
of
respondents
that
petitioner
is
not
entailed
to
injunctive
relief
because
one,
at
this
juncture
he
needs
the
--
the
injunction
he
seeks
solely
for
the
purposes
of
keeping
alive
this
litigation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
other
side
of
it
is
that
the
restraint
imposed
upon
the
government
has
been
very
severe.
one
example
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
has
been
and
is.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
is.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
with
respect
to
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
respondents
would
have
no
objection
to
an
order
of
this
court
which
read
if
i
may
somewhat
as
follows.
the
judgments
below
are
affirmed,
unless
by
a
certain
date
and
i
suggest
april
1,
petitioner
pays
his
patent
fee
without
requesting
a
suspension
of
the
issuance
of
the
patent,
and
if
by
april
1,
petitioner
does
pay
the
patent
fee,
and
does
not
request
a
suspension,
the
judgments
below
are
vacated
as
moot.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
there
is
--
once
the
fee
is
paid
there
is
a
period
of
six
to
eight
weeks
before
the
patent
issues.
april
1
is
an
arbitrary
date
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
order
of
this
court
were
to
read
that
judgments
below
are
affirmed
unless
by
may
25,
1959;
petitioner
pays
his
patent
fee.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
has
paid
his
patent
fee,
without
requesting
suspension
of
the
issuance
of
the
patent
and
if
by
april
1,
1959
he
has
paid
the
fee
has
not
requested
a
suspension,
the
judgments
below
are
vacated
as
moot.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
significance
of
that
is
--
i
want
to
clear
that
there
will
be
no
more
dilatory
tactics.
there
will
be
no
resort
to
the
law
of
india,
if
the
court
please,
but
that
this
be
over
and
done
with.
in
all
respect
to
the
amici
in
this
case,
there
are
no
--
the
great
test
issues
are
not
in
fact
presented
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
the
vacation
of
the
judgments
below
as
moot
will
--
as
this
court
did
only
recently
in
the
midwestern
gas
case,
it
fits
that
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
will
be
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
judgment
below
denied
injunctive
relief.
i
think
that
if
unless
the
petitioner
pays
his
fee
on
the
date
set
by
this
court,
he
is
not
entitled
to
injunctive
relief.
therefore
the
judgment
below
would
be
affirmed.
the
result
of
the
court
below
which
was
to
dismiss
the
complaints
for
injunctive
relief
would
be
affirmed.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
not,
i
think
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity,
the
court
would
be
in
effect
continuing
the
temporary
stay
order
which
now
exists,
subject
to
these
conditions.
perhaps
this
should
read
the
temporary
restraining
order
is
continued
until
such
and
such
a
date.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
that,
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
is
a
point
that
could
be
disposed
of
in
the
wording
of
the
order
because
the
thought
that
i
mean
to
express
is
that
the
result
which
is
the
denial
of
injunctive
relief.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
how
long
it
would
take
to
disseminate,
well
i
think
there
are
some
steps
that
would
be
taken
immediately.
this
would
stop
when
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
imposed,
and
as
soon
as
the
judgments
below
were
affirmed
and
the
temporary
restraining
order
vacated,
which
i
hope
it
would
--
this
court
would
do
in
the
same
order
and
on
the
same
time,
the
dissemination
would
proceed
with
this
batch.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
your
point,
i
think
the
point
is
mr.
justice
clark
is
that
that
this
case
is
dying
in
any
event.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
i
think
that's
right
and
i
don't
--
i
think
that's
something
which
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that
that's
a
misuse
of
this
court,
i
think
it's
a
misuse
of
the
powers
of
court
of
equity,
i
think
it
has
been
a
--
i
think
it
hasn't
been
good
faith.
if
the
court
should
wish
to
indicate
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
it
bears
on
it.
i
think
he
has
a
statutory
right
to
do
that
perhaps
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
i
withdraw
any
aspersion
i
may
have
cast,
perhaps
i
was
carried
away.
but
the
fact
that
that
he
had
the
statutory
right
and
has
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think,
i
think
his
insistence
on
waiting
till
the
last
moment
is
something
which
is
relevant
in
terms
of
determining
his,
whether
he
is
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
has
had
two
years.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
my
remarks
were
solely
directed
to
the
consideration
that
the,
delaying
payment
of
the
fee
was
to
have
a
decision
by
this
court.
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think,
i
think
that
that
is
an
improper
use
of
--
that
would
be
an
improper
use
of
injunctive
relief.
