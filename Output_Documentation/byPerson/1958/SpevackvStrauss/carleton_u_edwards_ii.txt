mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
just
propose
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
new
issue
which
the
respondents
have
sought
to
raise
in
this
case.
they
have
always
previously
relied
on
statutory
authority
to
do
the
act
which
we
seek
to
enjoin.
i
can
cite
instances
in
their
previous
briefs
on
many
occasions.
as
mr.
houghton
has
indicated
they
have
now
abandoned
this
and
they
now
seek
to
find
a
consent
which
they
content
they
obtained
from
the
petitioner
by
way
of
some
agreements
which
are
not
even
before
this
court.
they
were
forwarded
to
the
clerk
by
counsel
with
the
suggestion
that
they
were
available
to
the
court,
if
the
court
desired
to
consider
them.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
the
contracts
your
honor,
prefer
not
to
call
them
employment,
they
were
strictly
a
contractor
basis
and
a
consultant
basis.
they
are
in
the
possession
of
the
clerk.
we
contend
first
of
all
that
those
contracts
in
this
issue
are
not
even
before
this
court.
secondly,
that
even
if
they
are
before
this
court,
they
do
not
convey
the
rights
which
the
respondents
content
they
convey.
the
initial
contracts,
the
first
three
or
four
merely
said
that
in
substance
that
the
petitioner
was
going
to
tell
them
what
this
process
was.
then
as
mr.
houghton
has
indicated,
after
they
had
revealed
the
process
to
them
and
they
had
decided
to
use
it,
he
was
hired
to
advise
them
on
how
it
could
be
handled.
in
those
contracts,
there
is
a
specific
reservation
in
each
of
the
four,
either
right
in
there
or
by
reference,
there
is
a
reservation
of
the
right,
all
rights
that
he
has
under
the
atomic
energy
act
or
otherwise.
now
as
regards
whether
this
issue
which
they
now
seek
to
raise,
in
other
words
if
they
have
the
consent
to
make
this
publication,
is
before
this
court.
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
rules
41
d2
and
40.3.
those
rules
specify
what
issues
are
before
this
court.
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
for
sometime
now
and
this
on
the
petitioner's
brief
filed
about
a
month
ago
was
the
very
first
time
they
ever
raised
this
issue
of
consent.
it
maybe
that
under
18
of
the
us
code
it
is
a
crime
for
a
government
officer
to
reveal
a
secret
process
revealed
to
him
in
confidence
and
now
they
have
to
find
some
other
means
as
they
have
apparently
conceded
that
they
do
not
have
the
statutory
authority.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
i
think
it
all
comes
down
to
this.
it
all
comes
down
to
one
thing,
did
they
have
the
authority
to
do,
to
publish
this
information
or
didn't
they?
if
they
didn't
have
the
authority,
then
they
are
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
their
authority
and
they
are
seeking
to
destroy
a
unique
property
right
and
therefore,
i
mean
the
destruction
of
this
right,
the
damages
would
be
incalculable
and
it
is
--
if
they
have
the
authority
then
there
is
nothing
we
can
about
do
it
and
we
wouldn't
try
it.
if
they
don't
have
the
authority
then
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
of
law.
it's
just
as
if
i
would
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
that's
true
to
that
extent
your
honor.
however,
the
principle
issue
in
the
case
to
date
and
throughout
i
think
it's
conceded
that
was
the
question
of
whether
they
had
the
authority
and
they
have
always
contended
they
had
statutory
authority.
now
they
have
shifted
and
say
they
have
authority
by
consent
of
the
petitioner.
in
addition
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
they
just
aren't
arguing
that
they
do
have
the
statutory
authority.
they
claim
that
they
never
have
asserted
that
they
had
the
authority
to
publish
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
i
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
that
they
didn't
have
the
authority
and
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
then
i
say
we
can't
determine
where
our
damages
are
--
it
may
--
what
they
have
done
may
have
destroyed
mr
spevack's
right
to
obtain
patents
in
many
places
where
he
has
applied
for
them,
which
maybe
in
calculable
as
to
what
the
damage
would
be.
i
don't
know
if
i
answered
the
question
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
your
honor
i
don't
actually
say
they
are
denying
it,
i
just
say
they
have
abandoned
their
old
view
that
they
had
the
statutory
authority
to
do
what
they
are
trying
to
do
and
now
they
are
shifting
over
to
something
else
which
is
brand
new
and
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
just
this
one
case
sir.
as
i've
indicated
in
the
rules,
i
think
this
action
is
prohibited
by
the
rules
and
also
in
the
case
of
wiener
against
united
states
decided
last
june
30th,
the
facts
briefly
were
president
truman
had
point
the
plaintiff
as
a
--
to
the
war
claims
commission,
after
president
eisenhower
came
to
office,
he
asked
the
man
to
resign,
he
didn't
do
so
and
he
was
discharged.
the
man
then
filed
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
for
his
compensation
that
he
lost.
the
court
of
claims
dismissed
the
case
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
the
issue
raised
in
the
briefs
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
whether
or
not
the
president
in
this
discretion
may
remove
a
member
of
the
war
claims
commission.
as
they
are
after
the
respondents
in
their
brief,
as
they
have
done
in
this
case,
sought
to
raise
a
brand
new
issue
of
--
they
raised
the
issue
of
defense
of
res
judicata
which
had
never
previously
been
raised
in
a
case
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
a
footnote
said
that
this
contention
was
not
properly
before
the
court,
was
not
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition
and
it
was
not
considered.
so
in
summarizing
on
this
new
issue
and
on
these
contracts
we
say
the
issue
is
not
before
the
court
both
under
the
rules
of
this
court
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
that
also
the
contracts
which
they
have
sought
to
present
to
this
court
are
not
properly
before
the
court
but
that
the
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
no
they
weren't
your
honor,
no
they
weren't,
although
there
was
every
reason
--
in
fact
counsel
statements
on
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
revel
that
he
knew
of
the
contracts,
in
fact
they
were
discussed,
the
very
fact
that
throughout
this
litigation
this
issue
was
never
previously
raised,
i
believe
there
is
telltale
that
there
really
is
no
basis
for
it.
this
is
a
clever
theory
that
has
been
developed
after
many,
many
months
in
these
litigations.
i
think
that's
as
much
i
will
say
on
the
question
of
your
consent.
i
will
save
that
the
remainder
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
id
it
please
the
court,
i
should
like
to
say
at
the
outset
at
this
time
that
unfortunately
this
litigation
has
consumed
a
great
portion
of
the
petitioner's
effort
and
that
of
his
counsel
dealing
over
the
period
of
these
months.
this
case
as
i
have
said
before,
i
think
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondents
have
the
power
and
authority
to
make
this
publication,
i
think
that's
the
one
big
issue
in
this
case.
if
they
don't
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
here.
if
they
do,
then
we
are
out
of
court.
there
isn't
any
middle
ground,
i
don't
believe.
now
there
is
tremendous
public
interest
in
this
case
as
evidenced
by
the
brief
filed
by
the
amici
in
this
case.
the
engineers
joint
council
has
amongst
its
membership
and
membership
and
the
associations
which
it
--
which
composes
250,000
scientists
and
engineers,
the
american
chemical
society
has
80,000
chemists.
the
american
chemical
society
in
their
brief
said
the
importance
of
these
questions
of
the
members
of
the
american
chemical
society
cannot
be
overstated
in
their
brief.
and
they
are
talking
about
the
authority
whether
or
not
the
respondents
have
the
authority
to
do
what
they
are
trying
to
do,
something
they
have
gotten
confidence
and
now
they
propose
to
give
it
away
and
destroying
his
rights.
the
engineers
joint
council
said
in
their
brief
since
the
engineers
joint
council
represents
such
a
vast
number
of
our
nations'
engineers
and
the
case
at
bar
present
a
serious
threat
to
the
fundamental
rights
of
our
country's
engineers
and
scientist.
consent
was
obtained
to
file
this
brief.
this
case
involves
a
very
important
issue.
our
government
agents
and
particular
the
respondents
here
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
something
from
somebody
incompetent
such
as
has
done
here
and
then
over
his
objection
destroy
it.
now
mr.
sand's
contends
that
they
had
a
statutory
duty
to
make
this
public.
that
statute
says
encourage,
permit
and
encourage
publication.
that
statute
is
talking
about
information
that
they
own,
not
information
owned
by
someone
else
such
as
in
this
case.
mr.
sands
contends
that
they
paid
him
to
tell
them
how
to
incorporate
this
process
into
his
plan.
they
paid
him
what
in
amounts
was
to
time
for
--
i
mean
payment
for
the
time
that
he
devoted
to
this
or
informing
them
of
what
this
was.
and
he
didn't
pay
them
--
i
mean,
he
wasn't
paid
for
the
destruction
of
this
right,
this
trade
secret
which
is
a
valuable
trade
secret.
mr.
sands
contends
that
all
he
reserved
was
his
right
to
compensation.
they,
the
respondents
themselves
in
their
brief,
in
opposition
to
the
petition,
admitted,
it
says
petitioner
reserve,
however
any
invention
rights
in
his
alleged
new
process.
in
the
brief
that
they
filed,
the
latest
brief
they
said
it
is
agreed
that
in
the
course
of
his
employment
petitioner
reserved
any
invention
rights
which
he
may
have
in
the
improvement.
now
when
he,
he
reserved
any
rights,
one
of
the
principal
rights
in
a
trade
secret
is
the
right
to
secrecy
and
it
is
not
their
right
and
they
cannot
show
anywhere,
where
they
contracted,
negotiated
and
obtained
the
right
to
make
this
publication.
mr.
sand
speaks
of
serious
public
consequences.
actually
there's
very
little
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
all
these
claims
of
what,
how
terribly
they
have
been
affected.
their
own
pleadings
show
they
don't,
in
forty
out
of
a
thousand
documents
is
this
process
involved.
and
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
the
court
in
this
case
had
--
no
answer
has
been
filed.
there
has
been
a
verified
compliant
filed
in
this
case
and
a
verified
amended
complaint
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
action
i
think
all
of
those
contentions
have
to
be
taken
as
admitted.
and
further
in
connection
with
the
reservation
of
rights
in
all
of
the
four
contracts
as
i
said
mr.
spevack
had
with
the
respondent,
it
stated,
“it
is
understood
and
agreed
that
neither
this
agreement
nor
any
compensation
paid
here
under,
nor
any
other
provision
of
article
5
above
shall
apply
with
respect
to
or
affect
any
rights
under
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1946
as
amended
or
otherwise
and
that
the
contractor
may
now
or
hereafter
have
in
and
to
such
improvement
made
between
aforesaid
dates.
he
reserved
all
rights.
all
he
did
was
to
tell
them
how
this
thing
worked
and
then
help
them
to
incorporate
it.
now
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
your
honor
unless
the,
the
decisions
below
are
reversed,
whether
if
this
case
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
if
they
are,
i
agree
with
that,
but
if
this
case
becomes
moot
before
they
are
--
this
is
going
to
leave
them
out
to
do
--
i
will
say
in
this
case
this
petitioner
has
been
mistreated
from
the
very
beginning
when
he
filed
his
suit,
i
mean
for
about
two
months
period
there
his
counsel
was
pleading
with
them
don't
please,
don't
do
this
in
substance
he
says.
and
all
the
time
they,
they
weren't
making
saying
yes
or
no
and
then
we
get
into
court
and
they
come
in
and
say,
show
that
they've
been
doing
all
these
things,
ignoring
it.
now
if
that's
the
way
inventors
and
scientists
are
going
to
be
treated,
then
i
think
it
is
a
sorry
commentary
and
i
don't
think
it
is
going
to
promote
our
scientific
development,
that's
what
the
interest
of
these
amici
are.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
both
of
them
your
honor,
i
mean
they
are
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
the
court
of
appeals,
well
principally
the
district
court
decision
held
the
case
it
was
moot,
i
wasn't
able
argue
that
because
we
didn't
have
the
time,
it
was
pretty
well
briefed
i
think.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
both
court
of
appeals
opinions
say
in
substance
that
the
defendants
or
the
respondents
have
a
statutory
authority
to
publish
the
information
belonging
to
the
petitioner
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
they
both
say
that.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
they
have
right
to
acquire
it.
they
have
a
right
to
acquire
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
they
have
to
go
through
certain
procedures,
they
could
have
gone
through
them
in
this
case,
but
they
haven't.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
i
don't
say
that
they
can't
do
it.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
i
don't
say
they
can't
do
it,
they
can,
but
they
haven't.
they
haven't
taken
it
or
they
haven't
gotten
the
right
to
publish.
all
they
got
in
this
case
was
a
right
to
use
this,
but
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
they
can
--
they
have
a
proper
and
procedure
which
is
outlined
in
the
atomic
energy
act,
how
they
can
acquire
this,
but
they've
never
gone
through
the
trouble
of
doing
it.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
they
can
take
it
for
public
use,
but
in
this
case
taking
it
and
just
throwing
it
out
to
the
world,
we
don't
contend
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
i
don't
think
that
they
contend
that
they
have
taken
it
here.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
they
contend
they
got
it
by
means
of
an
agreement
which
we
say
they
didn't
get
by
means
of
said
agreement.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
i
say
they
had
a
right
to
take
but
they
never
exercised
it.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
they
contend
they
got
it
by
a
contract,
but
that
has
never
been
tried,
that's
an
issues
for
a
trial
court
and
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
that's
an
issue
that
has
never
been
decided
and
i
think
it's
an
issue
for
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
yes,
a
man
has
right
to
go
to
court
and
contest
the
amount
they
want
to
give
to
him.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
they
have
a
right
under
atomic
energy
act
to
take
--
get
this,
but
they've
never
exercised
and
i
don't
know
all
the
details
of
it,
but
they
have
not
exercised.
i
just
want
to
say
once
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
i
don't
think
we
can
get
any
money.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
only
in
case
mr.
spevack
is
enable
to
apply
for
further
patents
before
the
case
does
become
moot,
that's
the
only
one
i
can
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
no,
he
could
apply
for
patents,
he
still
has
a
right
to
apply
for
patents
in
certain
foreign
countries
and
he
could
continue
to
do
that
until
it
definitely
becomes
moot,
but
we
frankly
feel
that
this
case
involves
a
tremendous
question
as
to
whether
or
not
these
government
agents
have
a
right
to
override
as
we
feel
they
have
done
in
this
case.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
that's
right.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
i
think
that's
correct.
i
just
like
to
say
this,
there
are
certain
affidavits
and
things
in
the
district
court
which
if
made
generally
public
might
be
very
detrimental
to
his
rights
in
foreign
countries
involving
whether
or
not
he
can
get
his
foreign
tax,
he
applied
for
patents
after
some
of
the
instance
which
related
therein
occurred
and
they
could
be
very
damaging
and
it
could
be
raised.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
no,
i
don't
think
they
would.
i
would
be
very
happy
if
they
would
agree
not
to.
i
would
just
like
to
say
this
one
further
thing
if
i
might,
i
realize
my
time
is
up,
but
mr.
sand's
contents
that
the
basic
theory
of
the
complaint
was
that
he
wanted
--
the
petitioner
wanted
one
year,
that
is
not
true.
i
mean
that's
not
correct.
our
paragraph
12
of
the
complaint
states
that
the
defendants
have
no
right
to
publish
the
same
or
any
reports
dealing
with
such
confidentially
disclosed
subject
matter
and
we
sought
an
injunction.
the
only
point
on
this
one-year
period
is
that
among
this
group
of
countries
which
are
members
of
this
convention,
if
you
file
a
patent
in
one
of
those
countries,
well
i'll
give
an
example,
for
instance
say
england
and
the
united
states
are
members,
if
mr.
spevack
filed
a
patent
in
the
united
states,
he
would
have
a
right
to
file
a
patent
in
england
anytime
during
the
following
year
and
the
date
of
the
patent
would
relate
back
to
the
date
he
filed
in
the
united
states.
he
was
prevented
for
six
years.
mr.
sand
may
have
erroneously
given
the
impression
that
he
wasn't
prevented,
but
he
was
prevented
for
six
years
or
whatever
the
period
was
from
applying
for
patents
anywhere.
in
fact
as
i
admit
--
noted,
he
sought
a
waiver
so
he
could
apply
in
one
country,
but
that
was
denied
and
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
mno,
we
don't
want
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
we
just
want
one
until
the
patent
issues.
i
think
the
law
is
that
nobody
forfeits
any
right
by
asserting
his
rights.
he
has
a
right
to
keep
this
secret
and
he
has
a
right
to
negotiate
with
people
and
license
them
to
use
it
if
he
wants
to
up
into
--
as
a
trade
secret
up
until
the
time
that
it
issues.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well,
that's
a
possibility.
i
don't
say
that
that's
what
we
are
going
to
do
or
anything
else.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
the
whole
point
is,
they
could
have
gotten
this,
they
had
a
right
to
take
it
in
a
proper
way
and
in
a
nutshell
i
say
that
what
they
have
done,
they
asked
for
it,
i
mean
that's
a
vernacular
way
of
putting
it,
they
could
have
handled
this
thing
right
and
they
could
have
done
everything
they
wanted.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
i
mean
we
can't
get
one
i
mean
longer
than
that,
i
don't
think,
i,
i
didn't
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
i
guess
that
was
the
substance
of
what
he
said,
i
want
additional
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
we,
as
i've
said
these
decisions
are
very
harmful
to
our
position
in
foreign
countries.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
i'd
say
he
did
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
i
say
that
they
didn't
have
the
right,
and
he
did
and
--
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
not
exactly
your
honor
just
that
the
government
agents
have
to
abide
the
law
like
everybody
else.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
i
think
we
are
fighting
for
a
principle.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
court,
let
me
answer
that
by
calling
your
attention
to
the
language
of
the
first
opinion
of
the
court
of
september
1957
where
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
clear
that
that
in
its
view,
and
we
think
its
view
was
extremely
erroneous,
that
the
act
authorized
the
commission
to
act
as
it
did.
we
think
that
it
had
no
such
authority
and
we
think
that
principal
should
be
eradicated
from
the
books.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
i
didn't
hear
mr.
sand's
concede
that
they
were
acting
erroneously
but
–
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
well
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
whether
this
was
a
battle
about
principle
or
about
results
the
chemical
society
is
not
participially
interested
in
the
results
of
this
particular
litigation
except
insofar
as
principle
as
concerned.
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
record
below,
we
have
not
seen
it.
but
from
what
we
do
see
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
below,
we
are
extremely
dissatisfied
with
the
decision
of
that
court.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
naturally
we
would
prefer
to
see
them
wiped
out
by
being
told
they
were
wrong
rather
than
to
be
wiped
out
for
mootness.
mr.
carleton
u.
edwards
ii
thank
you,
your
honor.
