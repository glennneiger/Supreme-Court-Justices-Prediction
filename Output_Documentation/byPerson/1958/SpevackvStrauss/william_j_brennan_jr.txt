justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be
august?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
you
say
that,
have
there
been
any
findings
in
this
effect
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
all
that
means,
under
contract,
is
that
all
it
says,
is
that
there
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
made
(inaudible)
statements
than
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
where
is
the
finding
to
that
affect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
answer
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
longer
mentioning
the
one
year
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
now
that
one
year
period
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
was
one
year
after
1950.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
he
was
--
he
could
not
do
that
because
of
the
intervening
secrecy
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
when
the
secrecy
order
was
lifted
â€“
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
any
longer,
any
significance
to
the
one
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
now
you
should
keep
this
stuff
to
yourself
until
i
can
go
ahead
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
required?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
get
this,
and
is
it
--
are
you
telling
us
this
that,
his
only
complaint
really
was
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
that
year
by
reasons
of
the
original
secrecy
order,
within
which
to
make
his
applications
overseas.
and
that
all
he
wanted
was
a
fair
break
in
that
all
he
need
would
be
the
year
again
after
the
secrecy
order
was
lifted,
and
that
in
fact
he
had
not
merely
that
year
after
the
secrecy
order
was
lifted,
but
two
years
now,
so
he
no
longer
has
any
complaint,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
me?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
that
theory
of
his
that
all
he
lost
was
a
year's
opportunity
and
he
wanted
another
year,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
earlier
that
it
was
told
at
least
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
one
occasion,
that
the
time
required
or
necessary
would
be
a
year.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually
doesn't
he
suggest
that
he
may
make
an
application
to
get
a
year's
extension
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
does
have
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
does
have
authority,
is
this
correct,
to
extend
the
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
would
be
may
25?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
up
to
one
year
after
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
would
be
may
25?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
which
date
is
it
now,
i
see
your
colleague
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
25,
one
year
from
may
25?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
significance
of
without
requesting
a
suspension?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it's
language
though
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
there
be
any
different
positions
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
edwards
may
i
ask
one
question
(inaudible),
how
long
would
you
have
this
injunction
(inaudible),
you
want
a
permanent
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
want
a
restraint
only
until
the
patent
issues,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
substantially
what
mr.
sand
is
just
talking.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
except
for
the
--
the
condition
related
to
the
application
for
a
suspension
didn't
mr.
sand's
offer
continuing
--
continuous
in
the
present
restraint
until
the
patent
issues
(inaudible)
and
then
the
matter
to
be
declared
moot,
vacating
the
opinions
below
and
the
judgment
would
seem
to
concern
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
isn't
that
acceptable?
from
what
you've
said
to
mr.
justice
stewart
sounds
to
me
that
you'll
be
getting
just
as
much
that
you
ask?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wipes
them
out.
