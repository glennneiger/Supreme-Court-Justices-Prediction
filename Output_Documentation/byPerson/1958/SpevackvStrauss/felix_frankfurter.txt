justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what's
the
relation
between
getting
this
case
decided
and
getting
your
patent?
are
you
really
(inaudible)
decision
of
this
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
still
don't
see,
what
--
how
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
whatever
they
were,
can
effect
the
validity
or
scope
of
a
patent
which
we
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
got
your
patent
this
afternoon,
what
effect
would
that
have
on
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
--
would
the
litigation
survive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
does
your
reporting,
getting
a
patent
is
what
you
want,
in
order
to
get
some
rulings
on
things,
it
otherwise
wouldn't
be
before
the
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
injunction,
a
prior
determination
if
you
were
(inaudible)
patent,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you
say
there
was
an
implied
contract,
i
take
it
it's
not
on
paper.
is
there
a
written
agreement
between
the
inventor
and
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
that
that's
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
we
tell
whether
there
was
an
implication
authorizing
the
commission
to
make
public
the
utilization
is
made,
i
don't
know,
how
do
we
know
what
was
authorized
to
be
made
public
if
any,
unless
we
have
the
contract,
how
can
i
tell?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
question
isn't
here
or
isn't
in
the
case,
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
your
enjoining
--
seeking
to
enjoin
the
commission
from
making
public
certain
information
arising
out
of
the
relationship
between
an
employee
or
an
expert
of
the
commission
in
regard
to
the
improvement
of
patent
above,
improvements
suggested
by
(inaudible)
and
the
employer
of
the
commission,
i
don't
see
why
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
that,
that
relationship
did
not
imply,
did
not
imply
the
exercise
of
government
powers
by
the
aec
to
make
public
whenever
it
(inaudible),
what
it
has
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
the
government
to
disprove
that
they
can
make
public
that
as
part
of
a
thing
that
they
make
public
working
with
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
prefer
to
have
your
self
intuition
with
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
offered
him
on
dependency
during
this
(inaudible),
but
i
do
know
really
of
having
read
opinions
over
the
years,
that
the
relationship
between
an
employee
of
the
government
maybe
contributed
to
the
government
while
an
attempt
for
his
employment.
those
relationships
now
of
course
are
subtle
and
difficult
legal
questions,
what
rights
he
has
if
any
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
there's
a
good
deal
of
litigation
over
the
years
in
this
court
and
what
you're
asking
is
an
injunction,
an
injunction
on
the
assumption
that
the
contract
in
this
case
barred
the
atomic
energy
commission,
which
has
usually
not
been
accused
of
accepting
dissemination
of
his
(inaudible),
barring
it
from
making
public
within
its
power,
everything
pertaining
to
it,
to
conduct
it's
affairs,
which
the
public
interest
authorizes,
by
the
public
interest,
i
mean
the
national
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
should
think
the
burden
is
on
you
and
not
on
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
commission
purporting
or
is
not
restrained
from
publishing
specifically
that
which
would
be
contained
in
the
specifications
of
the
patent
or
are
they
publishing
things
which
impliedly
would
make
public
in
that
they
don't
want
to
publish
mr.
spevack's
potential
patent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
we
have
decide
in
this
case
to
what
extent
these
reservations
that
speak
you
of,
cut
across
the
such
responsibility,
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
has,
vis-à-vis
the
other
countries,
for
instance
namely
the
vienna
organization,
the
atomic
--
for
treaty
which
is
printed
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
euratom.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
do
we
have
to
decide
that
whether
the
reservations
of
a
single
inventor
(inaudible)
whose
product
the
government
wants
to
use
and
agrees
to
pay
for,
cuts
across
international
responsibility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do
have
some
responsibility
under
euratom,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
have
gone
back
on
what
is
and
what
is
not
right?
what
is
the
nature
of
a
withheld
private
interest,
that's
where
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
yet
if
you
got
the
patent
you
would
destroy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
can
get
that
anyhow,
just
have
to
do
it
for
17
years.
your
trouble
is
with
foreign
countries
about
your
rights
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
how
will
that
be
protected
if
you
get
the
patent
on
your
own
in
august?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
the
basis
of
your
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
the
gravmen
of
your
agreements
was
that
this
will
adversely
affect
(inaudible)
foreign
patents,
so
this
would
involvement
a
publication
and
therefore
run
the
(inaudible)
of
foreign
patents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
government
takes
that
away
from
you
or
destroys
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
you
have
it,
you
can
get
compensation
for
that
destruction
in
this
country,
can't
you?
you
believe
that
you
have
something,
which
the
permission
for
publication
destroys,
would
violate
the
agreement
(inaudible)
cause
of
action
in
the
courts
of
law,
either
under
the
federal
tort
action,
yes
under
the
federal
tort
act
of
the
court
of
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
think
(inaudible)
if
you
want
to
enjoin
them,
because
it
will
do
damage
to
him
abroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
why
do
you
and
your
associates
say
they
have
abandoned
everything
except
this
new
trial?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
just
looked
at
(inaudible),
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
your
disagreeing
with
the
government,
namely
that
there
is
an
adequate,
that
damages
are
incalculable,
therefore
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
the
district,
where
they
in
the
proceedings
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
he
that
choice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
introduced
--
you've
introduced
a
statement
which
takes
care
of
most
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
qualification
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
provision
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
after
we
(inaudible)
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
would
have
make
everything
public
that
is
known.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
that
--
suggest
that
under
those
reservations,
they
withholding
that
you
are
under
obligation
by
our
law
not
make
public,
anything
in
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
the
arrangement
you
mean
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
true
that
the
contract
itself
was
not
before
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
have
reserved
the
right
that
you
should
not
make
it
public,
assuming
there
was
no
statutory
duty
to
make
public,
could
he
have
reserved
that
right?
could
he
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
how
can
i
tell
whether
he
did
or
didn't
without
seeing
the
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
whether
government
can
describe
what
you
call
its
plant,
can
it
describe
its
plant,
and
at
the
same
time
not
be
authorized
or
not
describe
what's
going
on
inside
this
plant,
if
it's
making
a
(inaudible),
water,
heavy
water
(inaudible),
is
that
part
of
what
--
is
that
part
of
the
plant
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
the
plant,
it
could
be
a
building
in
which
things
are
done
inside,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
your
choice
because
that
involves
what
he
feels,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
he
says
–
except
that
he
says
that
his
right
not
to
have
it
published
and
his
right
to
postpone
getting
a
patent
as
long
as
possible,
gives
him
opportunity
to
make
arrangement
regarding
(inaudible)
abroad,
which
is
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
disallowed
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
disallowed
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand
i'd
like
to
know
whether
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
ever
ask
them
to
pay
for
the
use
of
the
patent
not
for
any
damages
but
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
been
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
paid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
you
don't
care
about
but
you
do
care
about
fourteen
months.
that
is
a
short
of
gist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
your
real
proposal,
your
real
suggestion
to
the
court
is
a
contingent
moot
order,
which
it
is
within
its
own
power
to
get
what
you
want
wants
or
not
get
or
if
he
doesn't
get
it,
he
is
entitled
to
get
his
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
could
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
get
an
injunction
out
of
the
court,
the
court
held
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
also
happens
when
there
is
a
controversy
between
private
owners
(inaudible)
and
governmental
authority
and
that's
what
brings
the
case
into
the
court
of
claims
and
eventually
here.
the
government,
people
say
it
isn't
the
taking,
because
the
property
(inaudible)
or
in
this
case
they
say
they
have
a
right
to
take,
that's
why
they
don't
do
the
statutory
provisions
of
condemnation.
you
say
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
take
it.
if
they
are
wrong
then
there
is
an
implied
contract
under
the
constitution
to
recover
monies
worth
in
the
court
of
claims,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
because
they
didn't
think
they
were
taking
anything,
that's
what.

felix
frankfurter
