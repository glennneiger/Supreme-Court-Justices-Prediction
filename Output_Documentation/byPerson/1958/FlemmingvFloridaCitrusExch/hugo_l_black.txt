does
the
record
show
whether
this
color
is
used
on
all
citrus
fruit
from
every
part
of
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
record
shows
that
all
florida
oranges
have
these
coloring?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
florida
growers
use
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
record
show
whether
or
not
there's
competition
between
florida
orange
growers
who
use
it,
and
florida
orange
growers
who
do
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
basis
that
those
who
do
not
use
it
calling
in
fact
attention
to
the
fact
that
it's
dangerous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
go
--
whether
that's
a
fact
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
chase
&
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
all
the
oranges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
the
--
is
the
record
clear
to
the
effect
that
the
same
amount
of
color
is
automatically
put
on
every
orange
so
there's
no
danger
of
having
enough
to
do
damage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
that
--
does
that
brief
show
that
they
did
that
because
of
the
season
or
because
of
these
competitions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
is
(inaudible)
company
located?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
quite
the
same
as
this,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
harmful,
you
say,
if
you
eat
too
much
or
drink
too
much
of
something
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
provided
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
provided
there's
no
extra
dose
happens
to
be
put
on
of
a
part
--
of
a
particle
that
is
poisonous
and
is
such.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
merely
one
that
if
you
eat
too
much,
it
will
make
you
sick,
for
one
for
poison
if
--
if
it's
too
much
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
record
show
about
the
guarantee
that
that
minimum
amount
will
always
appear
on
every
orange?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that
would
be
rather
difficult
to
look
at
--
at
each
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
maybe
that
there
might
be
a
difference
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
it
put
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
individual
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
by
machine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
as
you
define
harmless.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
as
you
define
harmless.
that's
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
real
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
real
difference
as
in
what
the
word
harmless
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
object
to
their
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
object
to
their
findings?
are
they
challenged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
liken
this
that
if
congress
hasn't
treated
the
insecticide,
then
the
coloring
matter
is
the
same
at
anytime
have
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because
its
proof
will
be
absolutely
destroying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
what
is
the
basis
for
the
statement
of
the
economic
disaster
that
will
come
to
florida
if
none
of
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
none
of
that
oranges.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
you
mean
you
couldn't
sell
that
part
of
the
fruit
outside
of
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
when
you
go
to
miami
or
saint
petersburg
or
tampa
to
get
out
orange
juice,
they
don't
color,
they
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
oranges
that
are
bought
in
are
not
colored,
isn't
that
right?(voice

--
justice

black
roadside
stands

justice
hugo

as
a
man
coming
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
all
colored.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
up
here,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
the
statement
you
just
made,
it
will
be
50
times
safer
than
salt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
(voice

--
when
you
said
that
--
when
you
said
the
air
was
more
harmful
than
these
things.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
mean
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hasn't
that
probably
been
contributed
to
by
the
very
fact
that
you
use
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
were
selling
more
until
they
found
out
how
good
those
florida
oranges
are
