mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
at
first
i
will
to
try
clear
a
few
situations
and
give
information
that
may
be
helpful
to
the
court
by
reason
of
the
questions
that
have
arisen.
the
reason
it
is
necessary
to
color
oranges
is
climatic.
the
reason
you
color
more
in
one
season
than
you
do
another
is
because
of
the
difference
in
season,
as
we
have
a
late
cold
or
not.
the
early
oranges
--
and
then
what
i'm
stating
is
some
place
and
other
different
places
in
the
record.
the
early
orange
in
florida
will
become
mature
and
still
be
green
on
the
outside.
it
takes
the
cold
nights
and
the
warm
days
to
color
an
orange.
then
when
the
cold
comes,
that
will
turn
in
a
very
beautiful
color.
but
at
that
time,
the
fruit
which
is
a
very
fine
fruit
to
eat
a
few
weeks
previously
can
be
insipid
and
over
mature.
and
that
is
the
reason
the
early
oranges
have
to
be
colored.
the
late
orange
has
a
different
problem,
the
valencia.
and
the
valencia
in
florida
and
oranges
one
of
the
few
fruits
that
will
have
blooms
and
little
oranges
just
coming
out
of
the
bloom
and
practically
mature
fruit
all
at
the
same
time.
and
when
the
chlorophyll
goes
into
the
tree
in
the
spring,
it
goes
back
into
the
orange
and
you
will
have
a
valencia,
a
beautiful
orange
in
january
or
february
when
the
--
it
is
--
we've
had
the
cool
nights.
and
it's
not
yet
good
to
eat.
it's
still
immature
on
the
inside.
in
other
words,
you've
got
a
--
a
ripe
appearing
orange
on
the
outside
and
green
and
immature
on
the
inside.
and
in
some
instance,
it'd
be
totally
green
and
in
--
in
other
instances,
it
will
be
streaky
and
when
it
reaches
fully
matured,
it's
greener
on
the
outside
that
it
was
when
it's
immature.
the
department
of
agriculture
for
a
long
period
of
time
studied
more
than
30
years
ago.
they
started
studies
of
it.
in
a
way,
they
are
the
ones
that
taught
us
to
do
this
thing.
they're
in
the
yearbook
and
official
reports
which
i
have
quoted
in
my
brief
so
they
can
go
and
get
a
picture
of
it.
they
told
why
we
had
to
do
this.
one
of
the
first
of
the
instances
in
having
the
color
and
when
they
start
to
use
it
was
over
on
the
state,
we
don't
think
much
of
--
that
raises
citrus
but
was
in
mr.
justice
black's
state
of
alabama,
satsuma.
the
satsuma
will
get
a
--
a
good
tasting
and
still
be
green
on
the
outside.
they
were
raising
a
few
satsumas
and
there
was
experimentation
carried
that
and
that's
the
reason,
economically,
we
have
to
do
it.
it's
been
part
of
the
agriculture
said
it
repeatedly,
both
the
senate
and
the
house
committees
in
their
report
said
it
was
an
economic
necessity.
the
--
in
--
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
this
quotation
in
the
brief
with
reference
to
the
testimony
of
the
florida
citrus
commission,
the
florida
citrus
commission
of
the
state
through
the
attorney
general
has
filed
a
very
short
brief
explaining
to
the
court.
and
in
there,
there
is
the
--
a
table
on
page
4
showing
the
percentage
of
coloring
and
it's
--
runs
there
by
years
there
since
1938
and
1939
up
to
1957.
and
in
many
years,
we've
colored
72.7%,
70.9%,
69.4%,
65%,
61.9%,
65%,
160%,
64.3%,
63%
and
the
highest
was
in
1945,
76%
as
of
all
the
fresh
fruit
is
colored
with
this
color.
there
are
few
instances
if
you
have
--
in
the
end,
in
the
other
section,
there
are
few
that
grows
on
--
well,
the
fruit
may
color
fine.
it's
a
smaller
percentage
and
answering
the
distinguished
justice's
question
about
what
whether
other
people
use
this
not,
the
record
will
show
that
the
chase
&
company
who
filed
the
petition
as
a
friend
of
the
court
and
is
opposed
generally
to
the
coloring
of
fruit,
covered
more
--
colored
more
and
all
the
half
of
all
the
fruit
he
shipped.
it's
just
a
question
if
--
if
you
happen
to
have
a
good
season
in
one
part
of
the
state,
the
color
is
good,
you
don't
have
to
color.
if
you
don't
have
good
seed,
you
color.
and
that
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
to
--
to
--
in
part,
both.
however,
in
--
in
some
areas,
there
they
do
at
some
seasons
they'll
have
very
beautiful
fruit.
and
the
other
seasons,
they
don't.
the
record
will
show
that
here
before
(inaudible),
all
of
the
fruit
that
went
out
of
texas
had
to
be
colored.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
every
box
of
fruit
that
went
out
of
texas
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
in
florida.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
near
sanford.
and
they
--
or
have
those
between
sanford
and
titusville,
in
that
area
there,
and
a
little
over
in
palatka
and
they
--
they're
a
very
fine
and
reputable
company.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
and
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
and
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
and
distinguished
justice
asked
the
next
thing
i
was
going
to
cover.
if
these
were
used
--
were
being
used
for
the
purpose
of
deception,
i
wouldn't
be
here.
i've
been
one
of
those
who
have
fought
for
the
integrity
of
the
industry
for
years
and
i
wanted
a
high
maturity
standard.
and
the
way
we
avoid
that
and
as
reference
made
to
the
regulations
and
statutes
in
florida,
the
florida
citrus
code
required
a
higher
degree
of
maturity
before
you
can
color
than
otherwise.
in
other
words,
they
--
they
--
there's
a
ratio
of
total
soluble
solids
to
anhydrous
citric
acid
and
then
the
bricks,
and
then
you
have
--
have
to
have
certain
amount
of
solids
and
there's
a
high
requirement
before
you
color
--
to
legalize
the
color.
there's
a
high
ratio
in
the
citrus
code
spelled
out
in
there.
in
addition
to
that,
he
can't
use
that
color
except
that
which
is
certified
by
the
federal
health,
education
and
welfare,
you
--
and
the
persons
who
manufacture
the
color
must
be
licensed.
they're
rather
strict
and
the
--
the
various
packing
houses
have
their
laboratories
there.
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
forbidding
the
shipment
and
entered
dates
stationed
to
that.
the
oranges
on
which
the
color
added
is
used
are
stamped,
“color
added.”
if
you
go
in
the
market,
you'd
find
“color
added”
and
that
was
by
the
recent
requirement
of
the
federal
government
at
the
time.
and
so
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
what
percentage
is
required
for
this
color
to
be
shipped?
you
mean
shipped
freight?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
oh
that
--
that
will
be
all
the
fruit
that
goes
out
the
state.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
about
now
that
there's
a
little
bit
each
year.
we
--
we're
putting
more
and
more
and
concentrate
about
--
all
the
fruit
is
of
freight
food
shipments.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no,
sir.
those
are
not
colored.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
that
takes
about
half
of
the
crop
now,
and
you
don't
have
to
--
it's
if
you
plan
--
that
goes
in
the
fresh
market,
that
is
the
--
the
colored.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
that's
right.
if
you
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
sir?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
the
fresh
market
is
not
a
declining
--
well,
we
--
no,
sir.
we've
kept
pace
but
there's
more
people
using
concentrate
than
did
before
but
we've
had
an
increase
crop
until
the
freeze
last
year.
each
year,
we're
stepping
ahead
and
in
the
increase
in
the
crop.
this
--
this
as
appears
before
us,
the
department
in
their
consideration
of
this
new
order.
and
i
think
the
department's
in
a
different
position
than
they
would've
been
in
the
original
application
for
certification.
an
original
application
for
certification
then
they
would
--
we
had
to
make
the
showing
that
it
was
harmless.
and
then
we
made
a
showing
and
made
a
good
showing
there
and
dr.
calvin
(ph)
by
testifying.
that
was
in
1939
after
another
300
million
boxes
of
fruit
were
shipped.
the
secretary
then
attempts
to
decertify
the
color
and
he
didn't
learn
a
thing
and
didn't
have
any
new
evidence
that
didn't
have
in
1939,
that
at
extreme
high
levels
it's
harmful,
but
at
the
same
token,
shrimp,
bacon,
dandelion
greens,
rhubarb,
salt,
pepper,
vinegar,
and
many
other
things
are
harmful.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
sir?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
that's
right.
but
you'd
have
to
eat
more
oranges,
peeling
and
all
than
you
would
shrimp
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
to
get
sick
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
if
you
ate
oranges,
peeling
and
all,
you'd
have
to
eat
14
times
as
many
oranges,
there's
a
bar
in
the
oranges
as
you
would
have
to
eat
shrimp
before
you
get
sick
from
the
toxic
condition.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
well,
that's
something
of
course
normally
the
secretary
would
have
in
his
police
authority
to
do,
any
color
they
certify
is
--
is
both
complying,
if
it
don't
--
you
just
have
to
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
not
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
not
anymore
in
coloring
or
as
much
in
coloring
as
it
would
in
the
colors
that
are
going
into
medicines
and
in
the
--
on
cherries
and
things
that
you
take
internally.
this
is
a
--
is
an
oil-soluble
color.
it
doesn't
even
penetrate
the
rug.
the
only
extreme
instance
is
would
you
ever
get
any
of
it
in
would
if
you
were
juicing
a
color-add
orange
or
making
marmalade
out
of
it.
that's
only
extreme
environment
use.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
kind
of
a
--
like
you
--
a
wax
or
felting
and
runs
through
and
then
it's
washed
off
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
and
it's
not
much.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no,
it's
machine,
your
honor,
but
it's
a
very,
very
(inaudible)
and
in
syringed
and
is
a
regular
to
protect
everything.
if
there
are
--
a
minimal
amount,
it's
only
four
parts
per
million
there
and
this
figures
which
--
so
much
about
having
to
drink
5000
gallons
of
juice,
eat
7500
oranges,
you
have
to
take
that
quantity
to
--
to
hurt
you.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
the
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no,
sir.
that's
right
but
it
takes
that
much,
you
have
to
get
that
much
out
of
--
out
of
oranges
before
it
hurts
you,
even
if
you
do
it
in
a
long,
long
period
of
time.
so
it
--
it
depends
on
the
amounts
you
ingest
and
there's
no
question
about
fact
in
that
because
in
the
testimony
and
the
reason
that's
important,
the
testimony
before
the
committee,
it's
important
only
to
this
extent,
it
was
the
analysis
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
of
their
opinion
of
what
they
have
and
it's
not
shown.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
that
--
that
this
color
is
not
used
on
this.
this
is
an
oil-soluble
color.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
instead
of
the
water
soluble
color
and
this
color
in
the
record
shows
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
the
second
circuit
didn't
go
quite
as
far
as
mr.
goodrich
argues.
they
--
they
--
the
--
the
middle
ground
in
there
that
you
can't
see,
it
must
be
absolute
or
zero
nontoxic.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
that's
right
and
there
was
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
there's
no
evidence
in
that
case
as
to
the
amount
used
and
therefore,
they
--
they
practically
had
to
decide
like
you
did.
the
only
evidence
is
the
amount
used
in
any
food
was
on
oranges,
on
the
outside
of
oranges
and
that
was
the
testimony
as
to
the
amount
used
and
the
testimony
shows
that
it
was
the
only
use
for
it.
and
i
also
would
say
that
if
the
secretary
and
the
court
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
was
a
good
decision
that
the
word
“harmless”
has
to
be
considered
in
a
relative
manner,
taking
in
consideration
the
quantity.
the
--
and
that
is
what
--
as
i
understand
this,
where
the
court
has
said
in
the
lexington
mill
case.
in
the
lexington
mill
case,
this
court
quoted
from
the
chairman
of
the
committee
and
in
1906
act
and
he
said,
“all
things
that
are
not
--
that
all
things
that
contain
poison
are
not
poisonous”
and
pointed
out
that
you've
got
to
take
it
quantitatively.
in
the
wood's
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
a
similar
situation.
now,
that
was
a
case
of
soda
water.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
that's
--
that's
true
but
if
that
were
true,
they
can
--
they
couldn't
certify
other
colors.
they
are
certifying
colors
of
greater
toxicity
than
this.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
and
--
and
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
but
the
only
reason
--
and
--
and
i
want
to
protect
public
health.
i
want
this
--
i
wouldn't
want
this
court
to
strike
down
anything
that
is
against
to
public
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
health.
but
the
problem
here
has
to
be
is
that
even
as
used
by
various
persons
that
he
has
no
right
to
certify
it
if
at
any
level
it
is
toxic.
in
other
words,
he
--
the
secretary
and
his
order
would
show
that
he
feels
that
he
has
no
right
to
--
if
it's
harmless
--
harmful
at
any
level
that
he
has
right
to
certify.
he
doesn't
think
he
has
that
right.
now,
we
say
that
he
has
the
right
to
take
in
consideration
the
use,
the
quantities
and
the
other
uses
and
those
sort
of
things,
and
that
there
being
no
showing
that
he
should
have
had
some
evidence
before
he
took
it
off
the
certified
list
of
it.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
the
secretary
has
the
discretion
of,
it
says
“harmless”
and
then
he
has
the
right
to
determine
and
to
consider
and
the
granting
of
tolerances
or
the
certifying
for
a
special
use
are
only
other
ways
of
determining
that
it
is
kept
harmless.
now,
they
were
the
--
the
secretary
previously,
some
of
the
secretaries
were
of
that
opinion
because
they
certified
dyes
for
easter
eggs
alone.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
your
honor,
it's
eminently
correct
but
the
evidence
today
is
the
same
as
it
was
then.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
i
mean
they
just
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
shows
that.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
and
so
his
--
his
is
not
--
is
not
a
question
of
finding
of
evidence,
it's
a
question
of
he
misinterpreted
what
rights
he
had
under
the
law.
he
says,
“if
it's
harm
at
any
level,
i
can't.”
now,
you
say
that
doesn't
apply
to
insecticides
because
he
has
the
right
to
do
that
and
he
doesn't
apply
to,
now
to
all
other
food
additives
since
the
new
food
additives
act
passed
a
few
weeks
ago,
these
questions
that
mr.
goodrich
about
oil,
and
they
were
saying,
they've
put
it
to
rest
because
the
secretary
spelled
out
last.
so,
it
leaves
them
this
question
of
food
that
have
colors
left
out
by
itself
and
it's
in
the
peculiar
position,
if
the
coloring
in
the
juice
of
an
orange
are
in
the
--
on
cherries
or
something
you're
taking
in,
he
has
the
right
to
grant
a
tolerance
according
to
his
position.
if
it's
in
the
marmalade
and
you
color
that,
he
still
has
the
right
to
grant
a
tolerance
but
because
of
the
fact
that
the
act
provides
as
harmless
and
he
can
choose
harmless
as
being
without
any
harm
at
any
level,
he
can't
certify
--
he's
saying
he
can't
certify
on
the
outside
of
an
orange
when
the
chance
of
getting
in
the
human
body
is
so
minute.
and
we
feel
that
he
has
a
right
to
take
in
and
--and
dr.
calvin,
chief
of
bureau
of
pharmacology
said
that.
mr.
(inaudible)
testified
before
the
committee
that
that
was
the
situation
that
there
is
no
substance
that
was
totally
without
harm.
and
then
in
the
last
few
weeks
in
the
report
on
the
food
additive
bill,
the
congress
in
its
report
pointed
out
that
a
pound
of
a
salt
or
four
gallons
of
water
taken
within
an
hour
would
be
--
would
be
a
harm,
that
so
under
this
standard,
nothing
could
be
certified.
now
there's
question
about
the
fact
that
they
had
allowed
us
to
three-year
stay,
which
we
did.
they
--
we
were
desperate.
we
were
in
the
right
--
beginning
of
the
portion
of
the
mid
season
shipment,
and
the
court
granted
a
stay
and
as
congress
passed
that,
there
was
a
sort
of
compromise
being
worked
out.
but
under
the
interpretation
now
placed
by
the
secretary,
we
come
up
with
a
new
color.
if
it's
50
times
higher,
and
no
effect
level,
his
position
is,
he
can't
certify.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
well,
now
i
am
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
you're
not
ignorant
on
any
source,
i'm
sure,
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
you
can
take
coal-tar
as
--
but
it
won't
hurt
you.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
oh,
well,
the
peculiar
--
there's
another
thing,
but
this
coal-tar
color,
the
old
definition
was
that
which
could
be
made
from
coal-tars.
many
instances
now,
it's
made
out
of
petroleum
products
or
even
vegetable
matters.
the
definition
is
almost
obsolete
but
if
it's
a
color
that
could
have
been
made
from
coal-tar,
yes,
that
you
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
it
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
oh,
but
always
on
the
tip
of
the
hair
and
--
and
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
and
you
can
take
more
and
more
of
it.
a
large
quantity
before
it's
harmful.
the
test
according
--
i
didn't
want
too
much,
in
fact,
but
the
test,
the
--
all
these
test
animals
are
all,
many
hundreds
of
times,
the
amount
that's
--
would
be
taken
in
the
human
body
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
in
their
testimony,
there's
no
showing
that
as
used
here,
it's
harmful,
but
they
just
say
we
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no
sir.
(voice
overlap)
that's
right
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
but
it
can
and
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
it's
innocent
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
it
doesn't
hurt
you
to
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
it
--
it
doesn't
hurt
you
until
you've
taken
an
immense
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
high
quantity.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
so
just
like
salt.
that's
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
i
think
i've
covered
the
high
spots,
and
my
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
colleague
here
would
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
sir?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
it
depends
on
how
we
interpret
it
harmless.
at
high
levels
--
at
extreme
high
levels,
it
will
hurt.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
the
same
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
same
thing
to
salt.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
same
thing
to
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
red
32
in
my
opinion
is
harmless,
yes.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
harmless,
yes,
sir.
it
is
harmless.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
sir?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
as
i
define
harmless.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
it
will
cause
damage
at
extreme
high
levels.
it
is
1/14,
the
toxicity
of
shrimp.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
so,
that's
the
real
difference.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
that
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
they
--
the
findings
were
based
on
their
own
substantive
law.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
we
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
challenge
the
fact
that
it's
--
these
levels
that
they
had,
that
it
calls
this
--
that
this
--
to
the
test
animals,
but
the
testimony
shows
that
they
made
no
tests
at
the
normal
levels
of
use.you
don't
liken
this
to
the
insecticide
do
you
at
all?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
sir?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no,
sir.
but
they
allowed
greater
tolerance
than
insecticides
and
--
and
they
say
they
don't
have
to
miss.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
and
this
can
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
they'd
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
they
just
won't
buy
their
fruit,
it's
as
green
and
streaked
looking.
it's
been
tried.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
they
just
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
sir?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
we
--
we
sell
very
little
in
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
florida
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
--
so
i'll
say
of
the
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
get
it
from
our
own
roads,
the
roadside
stands.
now,
in
the
roadside
stands,
it's
colored
mostly.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
they
don't
color
for
the
orange
juice.
no
sir,
because
that'd
be
an
extra
(voice
overlap)
and
no
need.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
at
the
roadside
stand
--
at
the
roadside
stands
it'd
will
be
practically
all
colored.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
the
only
place
you
that
you
go
and
the
man's
grove
and
he
gives
you
some,
they
won't
be
colored
or
if
you
buy
some
there
and
that
situation
that's
there.
but
if
it's
--
if
it
was
going
in
the
market,
if
it's
saint
petersburg
or
miami,
that
fruit
that's
in
the
market
there
is
--
is
colored.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no
sir.
about
68%
of
all
fruit
that
comes
up
are
colored.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
didn't
get
you.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
the
green
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
there's
been
a
little
bit
in
canada
we've
tried
to
do
that
a
little
bit
hadn't
been
very
successful.
the
sales
fell
off
considerably
after
that.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
as
far
as
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
sir
--
i
didn't
get
you.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
we
--
we
--
they
educate
them
to
something
--
they've
been
telling
them
20
or
30
years.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
my
time's
up
then
i
didn't
want
to
take
from
my
--
were
you
about
to
ask?
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
all
right.
i
think
--
i
may
be
accused
going
outside
of
the
record
(inaudible)
the
court
and
i
don't
think
mr.
goodrich
would
object.
we've
done
research
since
then.
we
have
a
new
color,
which
is
--
where
we
say
as
of
this
times
the
safety
factor
is
this.
it
doesn't
have
as
much
residue.
it
takes
less
colored
matter,
about
1/5
the
total
amount
in
the
--
i
mean,
about
1/10
the
total
amount
in
1/15
of
residue,
but
the
position
taken
by
my
department
that
even
at
high
levels,
it
would
harm
a
rat
and
they
can't
certify
that.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes.
they
--
the
word
harmless.
the
interpretation
of
the
word
harmless
stands
in
the
way
of
our
working
something
out.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir,
and
under
this
--
under
this
interpretation
as
the
secretary
construed,
he
can't
certify
it
and
so
this
court
could
say
to
them
that
in
considering
what
is
harmless,
you
must
consider
the
uses
and
the
amounts
used
and
take
those
things,
what
i
say
reasonable
rather
than
extremely,
the
--
insist
on
zero
toxicity
and
as
nothing,
zero
toxicity
except
in
the
test
tube.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
safer.
yes,
sir.
it's
safer
than
salt,
yes.
salt,
and
a
--
there
a
lot
of
things,
dandelion,
rhubarb,
bacon.
bacon
is
--
it
will
make
a
person
sick
quicker
than
the
same
amount
of
this
color.
and
this
court
in
the
lexington
mill
case,
it
pointed
out
pretty
well
it's
within,
said
the
air
we
breathes
in,
it
appear.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
we
have
a
(inaudible)
but
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
his
view
is
what
went
on
to
be
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
well
--
no,
this
court
has
said
in
--
in
two
case
that
it's
not
the
usurpation
of
how
a
court
is
going
to
interpret
the
word
but
they
can
interpret
the
will
of
the
congress
in
a
reasonable
way
and
--
and
that
this
court
i
think
it's
the
(inaudible)
case
is
one
them.
the
two
cases
as
i
cite
them
in
the
brief.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
yes,
sir.
when
you
say
that
you
must
consider
the
usage
and
the
amount.
now,
as
to
where,
how
much
when
it's
(inaudible).
the
court
can't
do
that,
but
the
court
can
say,
it's
late
for
us
to
get
a
formula
as
to
what
congress
means.
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no,
i
didn't
say
--
mr.
j.
hardin
peterson
no.
[laughter]
(inaudible)
i
did
say
more
harmful,
(inaudible)
--
the
court
has
pointed
out
as
an
opinion
--
thinking
that
the
air
we
breathe
(inaudible)
but
thank
you
very
much.
