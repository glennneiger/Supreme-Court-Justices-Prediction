justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
goodrich.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
appreciate
your
details
more
if
you
would
tell
us
to
what
purpose
do
you
submit
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
we
--
is
it
--
is
it
open
to
us
to
decide
whether
the
scientific
proof
established
the
conclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
goodrich.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
remember
vividly
the
second
chief
of
the
bureau
of
chemistry
that
it
then
called
dr.
osburg
saying
that
harmless
and
poisonous,
very
dangerous
concepts
to
use
because
so
normally
harmless
an
ingredient
of
food
as
salt,
they
become
toxic
depending
upon
the
dose.
thinking
as
a
chemist,
i'm
not
talking
about
statutory
construction,
you
agree
--
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
the
problem
here
is
not
whether
this
is
abstractly
harmless
or
--
or
not
sufficient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
light
of
the
statutory
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
applicable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
real
issue
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
plus
whatever
weight
is
to
be
given
with
the
findings
of
the
secretary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
the
--
in
view
of
the
suggestion
of
justice
stewart
that
provided
congress
doesn't
do
anything,
does
the
industry
have
to
do
something?
does
it
have
to
get
it
--
can
both
the
department
and
the
industry
await
the
cut
off
day
in
march
to
see
whether
anything
happens,
whether
or
not
the
open
structure
of
the
statute
should
then
begin
to
operate.
or,
first,
some
action
be
taken
by
the
industry
in
regard
to
the
use
and
non-use
for
the
future?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
my
question
from
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
believe,
they
had
in
legislation
but
must
be
beforehand
they
--
can
they
assume
--
must
--
must
it
take
some
steps
to
adjust
themselves?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
this.
that
maybe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
more
specific,
i'm
directing
my
--
my
question
towards
the
problem
of
movement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
these
cases
as
it
were,
present
the
--
a
moot
question
up
to
march
1st,
is
it,
march
31st?
justice
felix
frankfurter
march
--
up
to
that
date
moot
in
a
sense,
loosely
speaking.
is
that
right?
i'm
not
talking
technically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
up
to
that
time
--
there
--
there's
a
stay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
directing
myself
to
the
question
of
the
mootness.
granting
that
--
granting
that
that
when,
march
1st
would
be
the
time
for
the
department
to
raise
this
problem,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
department
on
the
one
hand
and
the
industry
on
the
other
cannot
wait
until
march
1st
without
disadvantages,
either
the
department
or
the
industry
in
case
the
case
should
ultimately
be
decided
one
way
or
the
other
because
either
on
the
one
hand,
some
administrative
steps
would
have
to
be
taken
for
enforcement
or
on
the
other,
some
industrial
steps
or
possibly
these
steps
couldn't
be
--
couldn't
come
into
--
jump
into
being
on
march
2nd.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
if
it
goes
as
the
case
goes
against
them,
they
would
have
to
get
going,
to
get
what
relief
they
can
other
than
by
legislation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
approving
the
matter
before
the
department.
justice
felix
frankfurter
conversely
--
conversely,
if
the
case
goes
against
you,
how
do
that
leave
the
department
so
far
as
not
waiting
until
march
1st
to
get
our
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
speaking
in
the
usual
sense
of
mootness,
this
isn't
a
matter
of
indifference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
study
until
march
1st.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
there
is
no
proper
basis
for
mootness
as
i
understand
that
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
commodities
utilize
this
color?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
a
minute
ago,
to
--
talking
to
my
self,
you've
put
out
this
color.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
other
people
put
out
the
color?
if
they
were
restricted
as
to
oranges
to
use
in
oranges,
why
isn't
there
any
restriction
that's
governing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
though
is
this,
elicited
by
justice
whittaker
inquiring
where
the
burden
lay
because
if
in
fact
it
is
used,
(inaudible)
that
it
is
used
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
on
oranges,
but
another
--
another
thing
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
then
it
would
put
a
burden
on
the
--
on
the
department
to
have
--
to
establish
the
consequences
of
use
upon
each
commodity
of
each
food,
products
on
which
it
is
used.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
the
remarks
the
cynamid
company
restricted
as
to
oranges.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
to
orange
fruits.
well
then,
how
did
it
get
into
the
market?
if
they
withheld
it
from
the
market.
i
don't
understand
that.
i'm
stupid
that
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
--
you
were
answering
justice
black,
that
there
was
some
testimony
between
nonusers
and
users
of
the
color
in
florida.
am
i
to
infer
that
there
was
a
portion
of
the
orange
grower
industry
in
florida
which,
out
of
a
sense
of
responsibility,
abstained
from
using
color
because
they
felt
it
was
deleterious?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
nature
provides
the
color?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
nature
provides
color
in
the
indian
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
nature
takes
care
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nature
provides
the
beauty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
goodrich.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
last
point
would
point
which
is
really
important
if
one
reaches
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
is
moving
everything
they
read
about
it,
whether
the
court
was
justified
in
drawing
out
the
restriction
of
the
secretary
rather
than
--
and
--
and
adopting
what
it
did
rather
than
sending
it
back
then.
maybe
certified
to
use
in
coloring
the
skin
of
oranges
meeting
minimum
maturity
standards
prescribed
in
the
state
of
florida
and
texas,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
now,
what
kind
of
standard
resulted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
gather
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
a
general
proposition
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
those
standards
are
not
a
clear
and
free
permission
in
the
use
of
--
of
color
within
the
discretion
of
the
growers,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
that
implies
--
that
implies
or
doesn't
imply
that
some
restrictions
must
be
put
upon
the
use
of
this
red
--
red
number
32
and
it's
not
to
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
a
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
continuous
for
what
--
on
what
basis
did
the
court
adopt
the
state
standard
rather
than
letting
the
secretary
--
because
that
implies
he
may
impose
some
limitations.
what
--
on
what
basis
did
the
court
determine
what
the
limitation
should
be
rather
that
the
secretary
determine
the
limitation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
as
to
your
--
as
to
that
kind
of
argument,
the
question
that
--
that
is
subject
they've
put
to
you,
i
should
like
to
(inaudible)
namely
if
this
kind
of
potentially
poisonous
matter
you're
taking
on
your
premises,
sufficient
quantity,
maybe
taken
into
the
human
body
not
merely
through
oranges
although
there's
nothing
but
oranges,
but
to
other
items
of
food
and
nobody
knows
in
what
proportion
and
i
shouldn't
think
it
makes
much
difference
whether
it's
oil-soluble
or
water-soluble
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
provided
that
kind
of
toxicity
goes
into
my
body,
it
becomes
relevant
for
the
secretary
to
say,
“i'm
not
going
to
certify
this
color
for
no
food
not
excluding
oranges.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
and
that
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
before
us
mr.
peterson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming.
justice
felix
frankfurter
writes
up
--
wouldn't
wouldn't
you
say
he
had
some
evidence.
i
don't
know
what
it's
worth
is,
i'm
--
i,
myself
dubious
of
transferring
results
on
--
on
cats
and
dogs
and
mice
and
rat
over
to
the
effect
on
human,
but
i'm
not
confident
they
have
an
opinion
on
that
subject,
and
(inaudible)
to
do
that.
now,
why
(inaudible)
a
secretary
a
right
to
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
views
not
only
change,
but
has
a
right
to
change
in
a
field
like
chemistry
where
there's
new
knowledge
or
new
inferences
from
all
knowledge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
more
insights
on
the
same
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
peterson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
imagine
how
ignorant
i
am
of
telling
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
not
agree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
believe
through
all
the
controversies
during
dr.
wiley
and
dr.
osburg
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
had
something
to
do
with
the
letters
of
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that's
the
source
of
my
knowledge.
now,
is
coal-tar
color
--
is
this
color
like
salt
in
the
sense
that
i
can
take
some
salt,
can
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
moderation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
take
coal-tar
into
the
body?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
i
can
just
take
it
as
a
--
assuming
i
can
swallow
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
found
this
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
tip
of
a
small
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
part
salt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
talking
about
it's
harmful
--
what
i'm
--
there
are
things
which
even
chemists
call
poisons
as
against
--
now,
they
don't
call
salt
a
poison.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
become
poisonous
and
toxic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
color
is
something
that
is
--
this
is
in
and
of
itself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
and
of
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
like
salt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
like
salt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
probably
you
don't
color
it
for
your
florida
consumers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
color
it
for
florida
consumers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
a
good
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
florida
is
the
--
is
the
biggest
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
supervised
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
but
you
just
used
the
word
1/10
of
the
toxicity
of
red
--
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
speaking
of
the
toxicity
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understood
that,
but
you
interpreted
toxicity
to
the
red
color.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
think
this
line
of
argument
--
i
mean,
specifically,
do
you
think
the
economic
relevance
or
and
importance
of
coloring
--
will
you
please
state
to
what
extent
or
in
what
way
you
think
that
the
economic
argument
that
you're
making,
assuming
i
agree
with
you,
even
though
you
educated
people
to
have
lovely
looking
oranges
as
well
as
sweet
tasting
oranges,
whether
it's
cause
or
effect
of
an
interplay,
to
what
extent
do
you
think
that's
relevant
to
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
scope
of
review,
the
exercise
by
this
court
on
what
the
secretary
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
even
--
may
i
ask
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
(inaudible)
even
the
decision
which
you
are
here
supporting
doesn't
give
you,
if
i
may
say
so,
a
free
hand,
does
it?
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
engrafts
it
--
it
engrafts
the
--
the
standards
described
by
your
state,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
all
--
are
those
the
only
restrictions
by
your
stand
--
of
your
standing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
quantitative
or
qualitative
prescription?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
you're
--
am
i
right
in
referring
to
this,
one
really
squeezes
your
argument
to
its
last
drop,
it
gets
down
to
just
this,
that
without
any
--
without
any
qualifications,
the
word
“harmless”
is
here
--
is
satisfied
if
the
use
of
the
proscribed
color
is
for
all
the
practical
human
purposes,
non-harmful.
that
there
is
nothing
merely
which
justify
as
a
matter
of
doubt
or
controversy
or
uncertainty
of
the
state
of
the
chemical
science,
but
there's
nothing,
would
justify
the
secretary
in
having
a
doubt
and
resolving
the
doubt
against
the
use
of
something
that
might
be
harmful.
you
say
that
the
record
doesn't
justify
such
a
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
been
taken
to
the
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hall
do
you
suggest
--
do
you
say
the
lower
court,
you
want
us
to
do
what
--
affirm
what
the
lower
court
did,
namely,
remit
this
to
the
secretary
to
recognize
it
as
--
as
harmless
and
then
define
the
limits
within
which
it
could
be
used,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood,
both
you
and
mr.
peterson,
there
are
limitation,
there
are
restrictions
inherent
in
the
orange
industry,
to
be
used,
so
that
he
doesn't
have
to
establish
any
tolerances
because
it's
only
used
at
such
a
low
level
that
there's
no
gain
to
put
a
ceiling.
isn't
that
what
i
get
from
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
goodrich
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
we
were
to
accept
the
tender
which
can
effect
the
--
what
the
respondents
made
that
the
--
the
certification
of
the
secretary
was
based
on
evidence
or
based
on
a
record
from
which
harm
could
be
--
be
used
only
by
the
taking
by
taking
massive
amounts
of
this
coloring
matter
into
the
human
system?
suppose
we
were
think
and
this
time,
treating
it
as
broadly
--
very
broadly.
but
that's
essentially
what
i
got
out
of
their
argument.
i
do
not
mean
that's
all
i've
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

writing
about
citrus
fruits
in
--
in
florida
but
assume
that
was
the
--
because
that
was
the
correct
issue
that
i
have
to
decide
for
myself,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposed
i
based
it
on
406
(b)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
have
to
decide
whether
harmless
means
the
matter
of
what
non-existent
circumstances
in
the
real
world
would
bring
about
harm.
that's
what
harmless
means.
if
it
doesn't
satisfy
impossible
--
practically
impossible
situations
to
reach
but
when
they
are
reached,
there
might
be
harm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
--
is
that
what
you're
tendering?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
possibility
that

that
your
imagination
can
conceive
of?

not

other
things.

those
