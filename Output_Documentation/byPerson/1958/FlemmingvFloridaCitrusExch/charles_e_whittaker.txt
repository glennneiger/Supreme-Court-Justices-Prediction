whittaker
mr.
goodrich,
what
do
you
understand
is
meant
by
the
phrase
“required
in
production”
from
practical
sense?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
such
as
insecticides,
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
spraying
and
the
light?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
--
which
you
say
is
not
required
in
production
but
required
in
attractive
marketing.

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles

whittaker
do
you
say
that

any

the
adoption
or
promulgation
of
some
kind

justice

e.
whittaker
well,
it
would
be
just
the

of
statement
in
that
way.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
reason
for
my
question

could
not
congress,

than
red

give
you
relief
before
march?
