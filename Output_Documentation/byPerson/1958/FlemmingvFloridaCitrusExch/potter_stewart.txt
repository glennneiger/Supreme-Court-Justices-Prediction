justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
--
the
course
of
your
argument
but
straighten
me
out
in
my
thinking.
would
you
--
would
you
tell
us
what
--
and
where

(c)
--
402
(c)
that

all
that
section
fit
into
this,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
appearing
on
page
3
of
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
proviso
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so
now,
there
is
an
expressed
mention
of
red
32,
is
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
in
effect
now?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
any
question
or
has
any
question
arise
as
to
whether
or
not
we
have
a
justiciable
controversy
here
and
deal
with
this
provision?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
as
of
now,
there's
expressed
statutory
permission
to
use
red
32,
is
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
providing
the
congress
hasn't
done
anything
in
the
meantime.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
peterson,
there
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
some
up
there
are
here
before
as
no
issues
whatsoever
as
to
deception
or
unfair
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
petitioner,
or
any
system
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
peterson,
what
--
what's
the
percentage
that
the
process
should
be?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i
gather
this
--
this
coloring
problem
only
deals
those
--
with
the
oranges
that
were
shipped
out
of
the
state,
that
is
most
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
all
go
out
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
all
that
goes
into
concentrate,
frozen
orange
juices,
and
things
of
that
kind,
they
--
are
those
oranges
colored?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
that
a
--
does
that
consume
a
substantial
proportion
of
the
total
crop?
justice
potter
stewart
instead
of
a
declining
market,
the
fresh
market?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
the
fresh
market
a
declining
market?
