mr.
william
w.
goodrich
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
concerned
with
the
problem
of
poisonous
coal-tar
colors
in
the
nation's
foods.
congress
has
provided
that
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
shall
promulgate
regulation
providing
for
the
listing
of
coal-tar
colors
that
are
harmless
and
suitable
for
use
in
foods
and
for
the
certification
of
batches
of
such
colors
with
or
without
harmless
--
i
mean,
without
harmless
diluent.
these
regulations
are
to
be
promulgated
after
public
proceedings
on
the
basis
of
evidence
and
are
subject
to
judicial
review
in
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals.
in
1939,
after
a
hearing,
the
color
fd&c
red
32
was
placed
on
the
list
for
unrestricted
use
in
foods,
drugs
and
cosmetics.
in
1947
to
1950,
there
developed
certain
scientific
and
congressional
unrest
over
the
possible
toxicity
of
a
number
of
the
coal-tar
colors,
particularly
the
oil-soluble
colors.
so,
the
food
and
drug
administration
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
undertook
a
new
scientific
appraisal
of
the
toxic
potential
of
these
colors.
study
was
initiated
in
1951
and
continued
until
1953.
the
method
of
studying
the
colors
was
to
feed
them
in
small
amounts
to
test
animals,
rats
and
dog,
which
would
be
--
could
be
kept
under
a
controlled
environment,
their
feed
and
other
circumstances
watched.
they
could
be
observed
during
their
lifetime,
sacrificed
in
autopsy
at
the
end
of
the
experiment.
when
the
experiment
was
over,
the
department
frankly
called
the
industry
representatives
and
--
and
gave
it
the
result
saying
that
in
the
department's
opinion,
the
colors
have
proved
to
be
toxic
and
not
harmless.
a
hearing
was
scheduled
held
in
1954.
hearing
lasted
only
a
day.
the
sole
scientific
evidence
was
presented
by
the
united
states
government
by
one
witness,
a
dr.
vos.
he
testified
that
the
color
was
fed
at
various
levels
to
rats
and
to
dogs.
at
2%
in
the
diet
of
rats
killed
all
the
rats
within
a
week.
at
1%,
all
the
rats
were
dead
in
12
days
at
a
0.5%
in
21
days.
the
lower
levels
were
fed
down
to
a
thousand
parts
per
million
which
is
a
tenth
of
1%
in
the
diet,
and
at
the
lowest
level
fed
there
were
distinct
injuries
to
the
animals
when
they
were
all
toxic,
the
injuries
being
to
heart,
liver,
spleen
and
to
the
muscular
dystrophy
activities
of
the
body.
dogs
fed
at
somewhat
lower
levels,
400
parts
and
100
parts
per
million.
at
400
parts,
all
--
all
the
dogs
involved
died.
at
100
parts,
one
of
four
dogs
sickened
and
died.
the
least
toxic
of
the
three
colors
involved
was
the
only
one
that
had
been
involved
in
a
human
episode
of
poisoning.
orange
1,
it
had
been
involved
in
an
acute
poisoning
and
the
symptom
which
it
produced
was
diarrhea,
the
objective
symptom
it
being
the
same
symptom
produced
in
the
test
animal.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i'm
submitting
them
for
--
to
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
color
through
scientific
evidence
was
shown
to
be
not
a
harmless
one,
but
a
toxic
one.
and
on
this
undisputed
evidence,
the
secretary
so
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
as
well
as
for
the
fifth
circuit
upheld
that
fairly.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i
think
not,
sir,
but
my
opponents
do
argue
that.
i
think
since
the
findings
of
part
not
harmlessness
have
been
sustained
in
both
circuits.
that
--
that
finding
is
binding
here,
but
my
opponents
do
argue
that
point,
so
i
was
briefly
covering
the
facts.
there
was,
as
anticipated
here,
no
controversy
about
whether
the
color
itself
was
a
toxic
color.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
having
a
review
by
the
entire
industry
sustained
the
whole
order.
however,
the
florida
and
texas
floors
pressed
for
a
use
of
this
color
at
limit
--
for
this
limited
purpose
of
coloring
the
texas
and
florida
oranges
orange
and
argued
that
in
this
special
use,
the
color
could
be
used
as
a
harmless
coal-tar
color.
the
idea
of
restricted
use
was
not
pressed
at
the
original
hearing,
but
was
brought
up
on
rehearing
after
the
initial
findings
had
been
made
and
a
few
days
before
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york.
the
secretary
refused
to
open
the
hearing
to
take
evidence
on
this
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
record
showing
the
foods
in
which
the
color
had
been
used
in
addition
to
oranges.
and
second,
there
was
no
evidence
on
which
a
safe
level
of
feeding
to
man
could
be
established
because
there
was
no
safe
level
for
the
rats
or
dogs.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
the
5000
oranges,
sir?
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that
comes
from
an
analysis
by
a
dr.
gerwe
which
is
outside
the
record.
it's
based
on
a
direct
transposition
of
the
amount
of
color
that
killed
the
rats.
now,
our
answer
to
that
is
that
it
served
no
purpose
to
draw
a
comparison
with
a
--
an
amount
of
toxic
material
that
killed
the
rats.
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
an
amount
that
could
be
safely
taken.
and
on
this
record,
no
such
level
has
been
established
since
the
lowest
amount
federal,
100
parts
per
million
killed
the
test
dog.
so
we
start
and
basic
to
our
argument
is,
the
point
that
no
safe
level
of
feeding
has
yet
been
established
even
for
the
test
animals.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
orleans
did
and
defined
that
red
32
could
and
must
be
safely
tolerated
on
oranges
alone.
it
supported
this
not
by
evidence
in
the
record
but
by
the
fact
that
secretary
folsom
and
commissioner
larrick
had
testified
on
proposed
temporary
legislation
to
the
effect
that
they
had
no
positive
evidence
at
that
time,
that
red
32
on
oranges
alone
would
poison
man.
at
the
same
time,
they
pointed
out
to
the
congress
that
neither
was
there
a
safe
level
of
feeding
for
the
test
animals.
they
simply
proposed
to
the
congress
that
the
industry
be
allowed
a
three-year
period
which
expires
on
march
1st
of
this
year
in
order
to
hopefully
develop
a
nontoxic
color
and
failing
that,
to
further
explore
the
toxicity
of
red
32
so
that
the
matter
might
be
taken
back
to
the
congress
and
authority
obtained
for
fixing
a
safe
level.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
decided
this
case
as
if
it
concerned
oranges
and
oranges
alone,
but
plainly,
the
principle
which
applies
to
oranges
must
also
apply
to
all
your
margin
and
to
any
other
color
or
any
other
food
in
which
one
of
these
colors
is
economically
needed.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
statutory
provision
accorded
to
the
court.
they
did
not
decide
that
the
color
was
harmless.
they
decided
that
harm,
it
should
be
read
in
a
relative
sense
and
that
led
them
into
the
preceding
paragraph
under
which
congress
authorized
the
establishment
of
safe
tolerances
for
added
poisonous
and
added
deleterious
substances
required
in
the
production
of
foods.
in
the
case
of
such
a
--
an
added
poison,
congress
authorized
the
secretary
to
establish
safe
tolerances
taking
into
account
the
extent
to
which
the
color
was
required
and
all
other
factors
in
order
that
the
total
load
of
the
poison
in
a
variety
of
foods
would
not
injure
man.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
said
to
the
secretary
that
he
could
not
supplant
his
1939
finding
of
harmlessness
until
he
was
prepared
to
show
that
color
added
oranges
themselves
would
be
dangerous
to
the
health
of
man.
chief
judge
hutcheson
dissented
calling
this,
what
it
so
plainly
was,
judicial
legislation,
dictated
more
by
the
needs
of
the
industry
than
by
a
fair
consideration
of
either
the
law
or
the
facts.
now,
on
this
record,
there
can
be
no
question
but
what
red
32
itself
is
not
a
harmless
color.
it
could
not
be
classified
as
anything
but
a
toxic
color
and
both
circuits
sustained
the
finding
to
that
extent.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i
hate
to
go
--
i
hesitate
to
go
wholly
and
indisputably.
there
could
of
course
be
some
abuses.
but
harmless
to
me
means
a
nonpoisonous
substance.
this
product,
this
color
was
fed
at
levels
toxicologically
significant.
the
toxicologist
who
gave
the
undisputed
evidence
said
that
he
used
harmless
in
a
pharmacological
sense,
meaning
that
he
compared
it
with
other
known
toxics.
now,
my
opponents
point
out
that
water
and
salt
could
be
abused.
of
course,
they
could,
but
that
would
not
make
them
a
harmful
substance
nor
would
a
small
amount
of
cyanide
or
--
in
the
red
32,
make
it
a
harmless
substance.
we
think,
and
we
will
develop
that
in
our
argument
that
congress
itself
considered
that
color
should
be
without
adverse
physiological
effect.
that's
what
they
meant
when
they
said
harmless.
the
committees
were
told
that
that
was
a
system
that
had
been
in
effect
and
the
committee
report
show
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
provide
innocuous
colors
for
use
in
food
which
could
then
be
used
in
any
amount
by
the
manufacturer
to
achieve
any
tint
or
hue
he
wished
without
any
hazard
whatever
to
health.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
certainly,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no,
sir.
if
the
question
here
is
whether
these
colors
have
such
a
low
order
of
toxicity
that
they
can
be
permitted
in
the
nations'
diet
for
unrestricted
use
with
no
hazard
whatsoever.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
in
light
of
the
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
in
light
of
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that's
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
issue.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
conceived
a
different
issue.
that
is
that
harmless
should
be
used
to
mean
relatively
harmless.
and
when
you
construed
harmless
to
mean
relatively
harmless,
that
meant
you
could
go
to
the
other
provision,
406
(a),
which
authorizes
the
secretary
to
tolerate
added
poisonous
and
deleterious
substances.
now,
i
agree
with
you
that
these
concepts,
theoretically,
are
difficult
to
apply
but
we
have
them
in
the
statutory
setting,
fully
explained
by
the
administrative
officials
going
back,
as
you
point
out,
dr.
osburg's
time.
dr.
(inaudible)
developed
this
system
before
or
where
it
took
off
and
although
the
department
was
urged
in
1907
to
permit
the
use
of
colors
that
were
harmless
under
the
conditions
of
use,
that
scheme
was
rejected,
the
very
first
regulation
that
ever
was
put
out
which
i'll
refer
to
in
a
bulletin
in
our
brief
was
that
only
harmless
color
should
be
permitted
and
after
reviewing
the
entire
scientific
background
throughout
the
world,
as
well
as
all
the
foreign
laws,
it
was
concluded
that
only
harmless
colors
would
be
permitted.
now,
that
system
came
forward
into
1938.
they
developed,
of
course,
some
difficulties
with
it
because
the
word
harmless
was
not
in
the
act
of
1906.
instead,
congress
provided
that
a
food
would
be
deemed
to
be
adulterated
if
it
bears
or
contains
any
added
poisonous
or
added
deleterious
substance
which
may
render
the
food
injurious
to
health.
now,
at
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
1923
held
that
the
department
could
not
prevent
the
use
of
a
coal-tar
color
in
a
food,
although
it
contained
some
arsenic
because
the
arsenic
was
not
present
in
large
amount
to
make
the
food
itself
dangerous.
that
was
recognized
by
the
congress
in
1933,
very
first
memorandum
sent
out
by
senator
copeland
pointing
this
out
as
a
weakness
in
the
law
that
the
department
could
not
prevent
the
use
of
toxic
coal-tar
colors
unless
it
could
prove
that
the
color
itself
made
each
particular
food
injurious
to
health.
now,
when
we
turn
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
we
find
the
word
harmless
used
in
contrast
with
the
preceding
section
406
(a).
406
(a)
says
that
food
shall
be
deemed
to
be
adulterated
if
it
bears
or
contains
any
added
poisonous
or
added
deleterious
substance,
unless
the
substance
is
required
in
production
or
unavoidable
in
good
manufacturing
practice,
in
which
case
the
department
was
authorized
to
establish
(inaudible).
then
paragraph
(b)
of
the
very
same
section
says
that
the
secretary
shall
promulgate
regulation,
providing
for
the
listing
and
certification
of
harmless
coal-tar
colors.
now,
this
difference
in
language
was
neither
inadvertent
nor
meaningless
and
certainly
in
the
setting
in
which
it
appeared.
it
meant
precisely
what
it
says.
the
statutory
plan
for
colors
is
one
in
which
the
department
is
authorized
to
exercise
their
laboratory
type
control.
it
is
enabled
under
this
system
to
protect
the
public
health
by
simply
withholding
its
stamp
of
approval
from
a
color
which
is
not
totally
harmless
for
use
in
food
and
thereby,
assure
the
food
manufacturer
that
he
can
use
the
color
in
any
amount
without
being
concerned
about
its
possible
toxicity.
both
the
color
industry
and
indeed
the
food
industry
have
so
understood
this
plan
of
control
for
a
great
many
years.
at
the
hearing,
the
color
industry
testified
that
it
had
no
evidence,
whatever,
on
what
foods
use
what
color
or
what
amount
of
food
use
what
color.
this
was
regarded
by
the
industry
as
wholly
unimportant
because
they
believe
the
colors
to
be
innocuous.
had
there
had
been
any
suspicion,
otherwise,
they
would
have
taken
some
steps
to
accumulate
data
and
to
exercise
precautions
against
unsafe
levels
of
usage
in
food.
if
there
be
any
doubt,
whatever,
about
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
in
this
setting
in
which
it
appears,
both
the
administrative
background
and
the
legislative
history
which
i've
reviewed
briefly
support
this.
this
voluntary
system
of
control
established
by
dr.
wiley
and
dr.
hesse
(ph)
in
1906
continued
up
until
the
wood
case.
the
weakness
in
the
law
was
pointed
out
by
senator
copeland,
the
principal
spokesman
at
the
time
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
of
1938.
now,
this
law
was
in
congress
for
five
years.
this
court
itself
has
pointed
out
that
the
sponsors,
the
draftsmen
and
the
congressional
committees
all
had
an
intelligent
understanding
of
the
many
provisions
here.
mr.
(inaudible)
explained
in
just
these
words
that
the
existing
system
was,
“under
this
procedure,
those
colors
which
were
demonstrated
to
be
without
adverse
physiological
effect
in
which
from
a
technical
standpoint
are
suitable
for
use
in
foods
were
admitted
to
certification.”
the
plan
was
to
assure
that
the
colors
used
would
be
nontoxic
and
free
of
deleterious
ingredients.
at
one
time
in
the
development
of
this
law,
an
effort
was
made
by
the
citrus
growers
to
enact
a
special
provision
which
would
have
allowed
them
to
continue
coloring
of
citrus
“by
means
harmless
to
the
consumer,”
and
to
exempt
the
coloring
from
label
declaration.
this
was
not
adopted
and
in
its
--
and
instead
we
come
far
with
the
existing
provisions.
throughout
this
entire
legislative
history,
the
color
provisions,
the
provisions
relating
to
added
poisonous
and
added
deleterious
substances
were
discussed
separately.
they
were
to
deal
with
two
related
but
different
problems
and
they
developed
different
controller
systems.
for
colors,
a
laboratory
certification,
the
secretary's
stamp
of
approval
on
the
color
that
it
was
indeed
harmless
and
could
be
used
without
restraint.
for
added
poisonous
and
deleterious
substances,
the
enactment
of
precise
tolerances,
taking
into
account
the
entire
load
of
the
poison
in
a
variety
of
food
as
well
as
related
pharmacologically
and
chemically
related
substances.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
all
right.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
402
(c),
your
honor,
is
the
adulteration
provision.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
it
--
it
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
the
proviso
--
the
first
proviso
in
my
brief
was
the
one
enacted
in
1938
to
continue
the
red
--
to
continue
the
colors
which
had
been
in
use
on
the
list
for
certification
until
an
application
for
certification
could
be
acted
on.
that
was
a
transitional
thing
in
order
not
to
disrupt
the
area
of
coloring.
i
do
agree
with
my
opponents
that
--
that
indicates
a
congressional
desire
that
coloring
be
continued
but
it
does
not
indicate
a
congressional
desire
that
coloring
be
continued
with
a
poisonous
coal-tar
dye.
indeed,
the
sponsors
of
the
proviso
assured
the
congress
that
the
color
itself
was
absolutely
harmless
and
it
was
so
regarded
at
that
time.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that
is
the
new
proviso.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
law
enacted
about
three
years
ago
which
expires
on
march
1.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
it's
in
effect
now
and
will
expire
within
a
very
short
term.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
we
raised
that
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
assured
the
court
that
this
was
not
being
more
than
a
stay
of
enforcement
of
the
order
which
expires
march
1.
the
secretary,
of
course,
could
stay
it
with
--
and
the
congress
stated
would
be,
this
does
not
change
anything,
particularly
since
it
is
temporary.
the
order
will
become
fully
effective
on
march
1,
1959.
and
meanwhile
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
until
march
1,
1959,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
there
is
an
addition
there,
i
might
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
there
is
an
addition
to
that,
a
judgment
by
the
fifth
circuit,
which
says
that
legislation
was
altogether
unnecessary
and
has
no
effect,
whatever.
the
judgment
we're
attacking
was
one
which
continuously
used
a
red
32
and
(inaudible)
beyond
the
march
1,
1959
that
the
court
held
that
that
legislation
served
no
purpose
other
than
to
provide
the
evidentiary
basis
on
which
it
promulgated
the
rule
for
itself.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes.
yes,
sir.
it
would
--
the
color
would
continue
in
oranges
until
march
1,
1959.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
correct.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes.
we
--
we
consider
it
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
provided,
yes,
sir.
we
considered
--
considered
of
course
the
idea
of
trying
to
hold
this
case
but
under
the
judicial
review
provision,
review
must
be
taken
within
90
days
or
not
at
all.
the
orange
growers
could
not
safely
sit
back
and
wait
until
the
expiration
of
the
three-year
period
and
then
seek
judicial
review
because
they
were
bound
by
the
90-day
period.
if
we
looked
at
the
temporary
legislation
as
a
stay
of
the
enforcement
of
the
order,
no
changes
made
as
you'll
note
in
402
(c),
the
adulteration
phase.
it
simply
says
that
the
secretary
may
not
enforce
that
adulteration
provision
against
certain
texas
and
florida
oranges
prior
to
march
1,
1959.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
if
no
step
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
if
no
steps
are
taken,
i
think
i
understand
sir.
if
no
steps
are
taken,
come
march
1,
they
will
be
without
a
color.
they
have
taken
steps
to
obtain
legislation
on
a
more
permanent
basis.
the
legislation
was
not
enacted,
nevertheless.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
certainly,
they
must,
sir.
certainly
they
must.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
if
they
wish
to
continue
this
color
which
they
claim
as
an
economic
necessity,
and
i
do
not
deny
that
it
is
a
useful
coloring
material
for
oranges
to
make
them
more
attractive
in
the
marketplace.
if
they
want
to
do
something
about
that,
they
must,
either,
win
this
case
and
continue
the
judgment
which
they
have
in
the
fifth
circuit
giving
them
a
color
on
a
permanent
basis,
or
they
must
get
some
legislative
relief.
now,
we
think
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
binds
us
to
continue
the
certification
of
this
color
indefinitely
on
oranges
until
we
are
prepared
to
prove
affirmatively
that
color
added
oranges
will
poison
people.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
get
back
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
it
does.
it's
very
--
there's
peculiarity
there
though.
it
--
while
the
court
says
that
we
are
to
reconsider
the
matter
and
establish
a
safe
tar,
it
also
tells
us
that
we
cannot
supplant
the
findings
of
the
1939
findings
unless
and
until
we're
prepared
to
prove
that
the
color
itself
will
make
the
oranges
dangerous.
on
page
186
of
the
--
of
the
record
is
the
crux
of
the
court's
order
right
after
the
quote,
“unless
there
is
evidence
that
in
the
amount
used
and
in
the
manner
used
on
oranges
colored
with
red
32
are
unsafe
for
human
consumption,
the
1939
finding
should
not
be
supplanted
by
a
contrary
ruling
by
which
such
use
is
prohibited.”
and
in
the
last
sentence
on
page
1
--
187
--
i
beg
your
pardon
--
the
last
sentence
on
page
187,
it
says,
“the
secretary
may
consider
whether
this
color
on
oranges
is
safe
and
harmless,
as
harmless
as
construed
in
this
opinion,
which
means
the
food
is
harmless
and
not
the
color.”
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
march
1,
1959,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
there's
a
stay,
yes.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
i'll
agree
to
that.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
the
steps
should
have
been
in
--
underway
some
years
ago.
as
congress
in
this
very
legislation
said
it
would
take
three
years
to
provide
the
factual
basis
for
the
same
topics.
they
gave
the
industry
a
three-year
stay
for
that
purpose
and
the
scientific
study
to
either
find
a
nontoxic
color
or
to
approve
the
exact
toxic
potential
of
this
one
is
one
is
one
that
cannot
be
done
overnight.
it
takes
three
years
as
the
committees
pointed
out,
but
that
three
years
is
almost
up
now.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i
would
hope,
sir
that
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
the
case
goes
against
us.
we
must
immediately
set
in
the
work
motion.
additional
scientific
studies,
which
will
require
three
years
and
a
very
substantial
sum
of
money
to
find
out
whether
red
32
on
oranges
are
safe
or
not
safe.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
so
we
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
this
is
indeed
that.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that's
right.
this
--
this
order
has
positive
effect
now
and
has
had
throughout
despite
the
legislation
because
the
three-year
period
was
chosen
to
accommodate
the
necessary
adjustment
that
would
have
to
be
made.
now,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
decide
this
case
on
the
ground
that
red
32
was
a
harmless
coal-tar
color.
on
the
contrary,
they
held
that
the
secretary's
finding
that
it
was
a
poison
was
well
supported
by
the
evidence.
they
turn
instead
to
the
provisions
of
section
406
(a)
dealing
with
added
poisonous
and
added
deleterious
substances.
we
think
this
provision
is
wholly
inapplicable
for
the
reasons
i've
reviewed
above
that
in
the
--
going
by
the
plain
language,
the
structure
of
the
statute
it
simply
applies
to
a
different
subject.
but
if
we
look
--
if
we
should
decide,
if
the
court
should
decide
the
406
(a)
have
some
applicability,
we
believe
that
we
can
demonstrate
positive
that
it
--
that
it
--
that
there
--
there
are
no
facts
on
which
safe
colors
could
be
established.
now,
406
(a)
was
designed
to
tighten
your
controls
over
poisons
in
foods,
not
to
loosen
it.
under
this
court's
decision
in
lexington
mill
&
elevator
in
3
--
in
232
u.s.,
this
court
had
given
very
comprehensive
meaning
to
the
food
and
drugs
act
of
1906.
it
had
held
that
any
food
which
bore
--
bears
or
contains
any
added
poisonous
or
added
deleterious
substance
which
may
render
the
food
injurious
to
health
was
an
adulterated
food.
the
court
held
it
may
render
the
food
injurious
to
health,
meant
any
possibility
of
injuring
any
segment
of
the
public,
the
strong
and
the
weak,
the
old
and
young,
the
well
and
the
sick.
but
as
strong
as
that
decision
was,
it
enabled
the
department,
only
to
deal
with
one
food
at
a
time.
if
you
had
one
food
with
a
level
of
poison
just
below
the
danger
level
and
another
food
with
the
same
poison
just
below
the
danger
level
and
both
foods
were
eaten
together,
the
consumer
would
get
a
toxic
amount.
now,
this
weakness
was
pointed
out
to
the
congress
by
mr.
(inaudible)
and
senator
copeland
and
congress
on
the
department
via
section
406
(a)
with
the
power
to
deal
with
a
common
poison
in
a
variety
of
foods.
the
solution
was
a
flat
prohibition
against
all
added
poisonous
and
added
deleterious
substances,
unless,
they
were
required
in
production.
it
was
enough
that
the
substance
itself
was
a
part
of
this.
the
department
was
not
required
to
show
that
in
a
particular
food,
it
would
not
be
a
dangerous
amount.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
by
“required
in
production”,
i'd
go
back
to
the
language
of
years
in
explaining
it,
a
chemical
without
which
a
crop
could
not
be
brought
to
maturity
in
the
case
of
oranges.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that
was
precisely
the
example
given
by
the
congress.
now,
since
the
1938
act,
congress
has
dealt
more
specifically
with
insecticide
or
residue,
but
the
precise
example
before
the
congress
on
“required
in
production”
was
arsenic,
lead
arsenate
sprays
necessary
to
bring
fruits
and
vegetables
to
maturity.
now,
“required
in
production”,
as
we
read
it,
is
used
here
in
a
setting
of
an
exemption
or
an
exception
to
a
blanket
rule
of
exclusion.
it
should
be
read
to
carry
out
the
evident
purpose
of
congress
and
not
give
it
a
broader
meaning
such
as
the
fifth
circuit
to
cover
a
post-harvest
treatment
in
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
i
draw
a
distinction
there.
now,
if
the
court's
decision
which
i've
cited
on,
required
says
that
it
is
to
be
construed
in
the
setting
in
which
it's
to
--
is
used,
that
is,
to
in
one
statute,
it
has
one
meaning
and
another
necessarily
another.
here,
required
in
production
was
a
necessary
exception
to
make
way
for
the
sprays
but
not
to
open
the
nation's
food
to
an
unlimited
number
of
poisonous
and
deleterious
substances.
we
think
once
these
oranges
have
been
produced
and
taken
into
the
packing
house
for
polishing
and
to
be
made
more
attractive,
production
is
not
involved
in
the
sense
of
the
406
(a)
provisions.
the
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
added
to
“required
in
production”
the
words,
“for
market”,
“required
in
production
for
market”
in
order
to
open
up
this,
the
way
for
the
post-harvest
treatment.
now,
second,
we
say
that
there
are
no
facts
on
which
--
for
safe
colors
for
red
32
can
be
established.
facts
i
reviewed
show
that
at
the
lowest
level
fed
to
the
test
animals,
injury
was
definitely
caused.
my
opponents
say
that
there
are
two
reasons
why
that
is
not
so.
first,
that
there's
been
some
canadian
work
done
with
rats,
it's
reproduced
actually
in
the
schell's
brief.
canada,
however,
followed
our
example,
and
took
these
colors
completely
off
the
list.
i
don't
feel
it
necessary
for
me
to
argue
the
factual
implications
of
the
canadian
work.second,
and
this
is
the
crux
of
their
position.
they
say
that
since
the
secretary
and
since
mr.
larrick
told
the
congressional
committees
considering
this
three-year
stay
that
we
had
no
evidence
at
this
time
of
injury
to
man
and
we
thought
the
possibility
of
evident
of
--
of
injury
to
man
was
slight.
they
stepped
from
that
to
the
next
point
that
that
conclusively
proves
the
safety
of
red
32
on
orange.
we
think
it
does
not
--
we
--
maybe
this
color
is
safe
on
oranges
alone,
but
that
fact
has
not
yet
been
established.
apparently,
the
owners
bring
up
the
food
additives
amendment
adopted
on
--
finally
signed
on
september
6
of
this
year
after
our
initial
brief
was
passed.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
it
has
on
oranges.
it
has
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i
think
it's
upon
the
producer.
the
whole
drive
of
this
statute
is
to
take
the
risk
out
of
use
of
poisonous
substances
in
food.
we,
having
put
the
color
on
the
list
in
1939,
obviously
had
the
burden
to
go
forward
to
prove
that
it
was
not
harmless
throughout
the
whole
--
the
entire
food
supply,
but
for
a
special
use
like
this.
the
risk
is
on
the
--
on
the
producer
to
prove
safety.
otherwise,
the
public
is
used
as
a
test
animal
until
the
three-year
work
is
done.
we
have
a
practical
question
here
of
protection
of
the
public
health
as
well
as
reading
the
statute.
now,
as
i
look
at
--
in
--
in
different
record,
the
record
of
uncertainty
on
whether
this
product
with
that
color
added
oranges
is
safe,
i
think
the
law
requires
that
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
be
given
to
the
public
and
not
to
the
colors
and
that's
why
we
think
the
burden
is
upon
them.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
your
honor,
no
one
knew
at
the
hearing.
there
was
testimony
at
the
hearing
from
american
cyanamid
company,
the
producer
of
this
color
that
they
had
voluntarily
limited
the
color
to
oranges
alone.
they
took
it
completely
off
the
market
except
for
this
one
use.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes.
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
now
that
list
came
out
of
the
certified
industry
committee
list
on
their
motion
to
reopen
hearing.
you'll
recall
--
i
said
that
at
the
hearing,
the
witness
testified,
he
had
no
evidence
at
all
about
what
food
it
was
used
in
or
in
what
amount.
he
--
he
--
these
colors
having
been
put
on
the
market
made
available
to
manufacturers
with
a
stamp,
“certified
u.s.
color.”
they
could
use
them
in
any
amount.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
there's
no
--
no
way
to
enforce
that
voluntary
restriction
aside
from
this
temporary
legislation.
it
--
it
would
be
a
certified
color
and
being
a
certified
color,
it
could
be
used
in
any
food
and
if
--
if
a
certified
color
was
used
in
food,
it
would
not
be
adulterated.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
it
is
used
on
oranges,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
the
only
showing
in
the
record
is
that
it
was
used
in
cookies
and
cakes
at
a
level
about
43
but
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
oh,
yes.
that's
--
that's
a
great
danger
of
this
case.
i
think
that
we
just
cannot
look
at
this
case
as
involving
oranges
alone
because
the
rule
of
oranges
must
be
the
rule
of
a
soda
pop,
frankfurters,
any
other
commodity
that
requires
color.
and
if
it
economically
requires
one
and
the
only
color
available
is
a
poisonous
one,
under
the
fifth
circuit
literally
can
be
used.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
they
simply
voluntarily
withheld
it
from
the
market
for
all
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that
point
is
not
fully
explained
how
they
could
--
undertook
to
control
that.
as
a
factual
matter,
i'm
informed
that
they
control
it
by
having
a
single
customer.
i
believe,
mr.
peterson,
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
this,
of
a
food
machinery
company
which
has
the
control
of
the
application,
there's
a
color
--
two
color
added
on.
this
was
a
voluntary
thing
and
was
at
the
hearing
considered
pretty
much
for
stopgap
measure
until
a
nontoxic
color
could
be
developed.
everyone
wishes
for
that,
hope
for
it.
i'm
sure
my
opponents
do.
but
we're
--
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
clear
law
written
by
congress
to
tell
the
administrative
agencies
how
to
carry
out
its
will,
should
be
given
an
unusual
meaning
because
the
present
economic
needs
of
this
agriculture
commodity.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
shows,
however,
that
the
color
here
is
used
on
both
texas
and
florida
oranges
and
there's
one
item
in
the
record
which
shows
that
the
california
--
i
believe
the
arizona
growers
proposed
to
use
the
color.
now,
a
great
number
of
california
oranges
do
not
need
the
coloring
to
make
the
attractiveness
that
sells
in
the
marketplace,
but
i'm
to
understand
from
one
of
the
letters
in
the
record
that
the
color
is
needed
by
the
arizona
people.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
the
record
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no,
sir.
the
record
showed
nothing
on
that,
sir.
that
was
not
an
issue
at
the
hearing.
since
the
hearing
closed,
my
opponents
have
brought
into
the
record,
evidence
showing
and
i
believe
59%
during
the
last
year,
florida
oranges
weren't
colored.
now,
as
--
as
i
understand
their
position,
the
florida
orange
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
is
green
while
it's
ripe.
it
--
it
ripens
before
the
skin
changes.
they
color
it
that
time.
again,
during
the
early
spring
when
the
green
comes
under
the
trees,
the
oranges
tend
to
regreen
themselves
and
at
that
time,
they
use
the
color,
but
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
there
was
some
marked
evidence
of
that
kind,
sir,
but
the
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
there
--
there
was
nothing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
there
was
something
of
that
kind
here
but
the
--
the
hearing
was
concerned
with
whether
the
color
itself
was
a
harmless
one
for
unrestricted
use
in
foods,
not
aimed
or
directed
at
this
florida
use,
this
single
use.
if
and
when
this
necessary
scientific
evidence
and
the
necessary
change
in
law
will
take
place,
then
we
will
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
problem
of
economic
need.
my
opponents
say
that
economic
need
is
established
in
this
case
because
the
two
congressional
committees
considering
the
mandatory
legislation
so
desired.
not
that
there's
a
word
in
the
record
about
the
need
for
this
color.
on
the
contrary,
a
spokesman
from
florida
citrus
exchange
testified
at
the
hearing
that
the
commission's
presence
was
not
to
be
interpreted
as
objecting
to
any
action
the
department
might
deem
necessary
on
the
basis
of
this
record.
that's
the
sole
evidence
there.
there
is
some
little
evidence
by
the
commission
that
the
amounts
of
color
in
oranges
alone
were
small,
but
nothing
on
economic.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
kind.
there
was
a
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
chase
&
company,
which
appears
in
the
record
which
challenges
the
whole
system.
now
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
on
the
ground
that
color
is
not
needed,
that
it's
toxic
and
that
it
conceals
damage
and
inferiority.
now
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
he
is
a
grower
of
the
indian
river
type
oranges.
i
believe,
which
does
not
need
the
color
in
florida.
there
was
some
country
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
sir?
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no.
the
indian
river
orange
grows
to
a
natural
beautiness,
a
dozen
requirements
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes.
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you,
sir.
the
same
as
the
valencias
in
california
but
the
--i
have
not
--
we
have
not
--
had
to
face
that
question
yet
because
the
color
itself
is
not
a
harmless
color
and
that
being
so,
we
didn't
feel
that
if
we
got
into
these
underlying
question.
now,
if
the
court
accept
the
fifth
circuit
view
that
406
(a)
can
be
applied
to
coal-tar
colors,
which
cannot
be
classified
as
harmless,
we
think
that
matters
should
be
remanded
to
the
department
for
consideration
of
these
question
which
you
are
bringing
up.
instead
of
doing
it,
this
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
simply
wrote
a
two-page
rule
for
itself,
saying
that
the
color
could
be
contained
on
texas
and
florida
oranges
until
we
could
prove
that
the
oranges
were
poisonous
and
meanwhile,
we
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
on
texas
and
florida
oranges
meeting
maturity
standards
established
by
the
state
laws.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
the
only
evidence
in
the
record,
your
honor,
is
on
the
basis
of
two
boxes
of
orange.
two
boxes
of
pineapple
oranges
from
florida
is
the
only
--
in
that
part
is
the
only
analysis
shown.
it
appears
on
the
last
page
of
the
record,
to
the
next,
the
last
page,
259.
i
chose
from
a
reading
of
it
that
it's
best
together
with
the
testimony
of
the
florida
citrus
exchange,
florida
citrus
commission
which
appears
on
page
224
of
the
record.
it
shows
that
these
analyses
were
based
on
two
boxes
of
oranges.
now,
just
what
the
variations
are
going
to
be
from
orange
to
orange
and
from
box
to
box,
we
do
not
know.
this
is
all
there
is
in
the
record
and
on
that
basis,
the
secretary
found
that
there
was
no
adequate
basis
in
this
record
on
which
he
could
decide
how
much
color
was
used
and
how
much
food
nor
was
there
a
scientific
basis
for
deciding
that
any
particular
amount
would
or
would
not
--
would
be
safe,
as
long
as
the
science
was
endeavored.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
they
are
state
laws.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
that
they're
enacted
by
the
state
laws
to
guarantee
that
color
will
not
be
used
on
immature
fruit.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no.
they
--
they
are
--
they
have
provisions
for
sugars
and
acids
in
the
oranges.
they
exercise
laboratory
controls
under
the
florida
laws
to
prevent
the
shipment
of
immature
fruits.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no.
they've
--
they
thought
oranges
could
only
be
colored
if
they
met
certain
maturity
standards.
i
understand
my
opponents
argue
that
only
the
better
oranges
can
be
colored
under
state
law.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
it
certainly
does,
and
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i
joined
the
dissenting
chief
justice
of
the
chief
judge
at
the
court
of
appeals.
they
did
it
on
the
basis
of
legislative
and
not
judicial
authority.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
arguments
my
opponents
have
made
about
5000
oranges
and
2500
oranges
and
50
times
more
or
less
toxic
than
red
32
and
other
statements
which
i
believe
are
somewhat
exaggerated
from
the
record.
the
comparisons
drawn
of
50,
5000
oranges,
2500
oranges
are
all
based
on
a
transposition
of
the
rat
studies
directly
to
man.
the
amounts
of
colors
involved
in
the
rat
study,
1000
parts
per
million
killed
the
rats.
that
is
not
a
safe
level.
the
lowest
amount
fed
to
dogs,
100
parts,
killed
one
of
the
dogs.
so
we
have
nothing
under
that.
there's
simply
no
starting
point
for
deciding
that
this
color
has
a
minimum
toxicity.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
to
start
by
taking
up
--
taking
up
a
statement
made
by
my
opponent
that
red
32
is
just
like
salt.
it
is
not.
the
record
shows
that
one
third,
the
weight
of
100
milligrams
that
is
which
is
roughly
one
third
of
the
weight
of
an
ordinary
five
grain
aspirin
tablet.
now,
red
32
is
a
laxative
dose
to
mean.
and
the
secretary
in
denying
the
motion
to
reopen
based
part
of
his
refusal
on
the
fact
that
red
32
had
been
involved
in
a
--
an
acute
episode
of
poisoning
from
a
single
food.
a
196
children
and
adults
have
been
poisoned
from
one
single
food
popcorn
containing
between
3000
and
9800
parts
per
million
of
red
32
which
established
that
if
the
corn
was
not
restricted
and
used,
certainly
it
had
the
potential
of
causing
serious
consequences
if
left
unregulated
in
the
dark.
it
can
be
known
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
sir?
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
it's
used
in
the
popcorn
after
this
case
was
first
decided
by
the
secretary
and
before
the
motion
to
reopen
was
acted
upon.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
there's
no
--
the
--
there's
no
legal
restriction
against
this
being
used
on
popcorn
except
the
judgment
on
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
the
secretary's
order
would
have
taken
it
out
of
all
foods,
drugs
and
cosmetics.
now,
it's
now
in
oranges
and
in
any
other
food
in
which
it's
economically
needed
as
a
--
as
a
necessity.
now,
the
toxicologist
who
testified
in
this
case
drew
a
distinction
between
red
32
and
salt.
he
recognized
that
salt
maybe
of
use
and
that
some
consequences
could
flow
from
3
or
4
ounces
of
salt
taken
at
one
term.
but
he
also
drew
a
comparison
with
carbolic
acid.
he
testified
that
on
a
chronic
basis,
that
is
a
long
term
use
of
a
small
amount
of
red
32
or
carbolic
acid
everyday
in
the
diet,
red
32
was
substantially
more
toxic
than
carbolic
acid.
now,
my
opponent's
implied
to
the
court
that
the
amounts
tested
in
the
new
scientific
work
between
1951
and
1953
were
massively
higher
than
what
had
already
been
tested
back
in
the
early
1940s.
that
is
not
true.
the
exhibit
is
set
forth
in
full
beginning
on
page
239
of
the
record
and
it
shows
the
various
levels
fed
to
the
entire
series
of
animals.
what
actually
happened,
the
toxicologist
started
off
with
2%
in
the
diet,
killed
all
of
the
rats
within
a
week.
he
then
went
down
to
1%,
killed
them
all
within
two
weeks.
he
went
down
to
a
half
percent,
killed
them
all
in
21
days
and
went
on
down
to
where
he
was
at
one
tenth
of
a
percent
of
the
diet,
which
is
the
lowest
level
fed
for
the
animals
to
survive
any
period
of
time
to
allow
for
an
evaluation
of
toxic
potential.
now,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
rats
which
had
1000
parts
per
million
or
a
tenth
of
1%
of
the
diet
had
a
heart
damage
where
there
was
no
heart
damage
to
the
animals
fed
in
somewhat
higher
level.
and
the
pathologist
himself
remarked
on
the
fact
that
this
showed
the
significance
of
long
term
exposure
to
a
toxic
substance
of
this
kind.
we
are
concerned
here
not
so
much
with
whether
a
man
is
going
to
drop
dead
tomorrow
from
eating
three
or
four
oranges
or
2500
oranges.
we
don't
expect
man
to
eat
2500
oranges
per
day,
but
we
do
expect
that
he'd
be
not
exposed
to
the
insidious
effects
of
a
small
amount
of
a
known
poison
in
his
diet
over
his
lifetime.
that
the
very
least
that
should
be
required
is
a
positive
showing
that
no
possibility
of
harm
can
come
to
him.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes?
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i
would
not
know
how
to
define
massive
doses.
i
would
say
that
the
decision
here
must
be
--
must
be
based
either
on
406-b
harmless
or
the
court
must
go
to
the
next
section,
406
(a)
and
tell
the
department
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
406
(b)?
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
i
--
that's
sir
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no.
my
answer
is
that
if
there's
any
possibility
of
harm
from
this
color
in
its
unrestricted
use
in
food,
it
must
come
out
of
food.
and
that
has
been
positively
shown
here.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no.
a
possibility
that's
a
real
one
to
a
trained
toxicologist,
i
assume
neither
you
nor
i
would
undertake
to
establish
or
decide
this
scientific
question.
that's
the
reason
it
was
put
within
the
realm
of
the
part.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no,
not
harm
--
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
in
our
reply
brief,
we
quoted
from
the
toxicologist
saying
that
this
color
was
being
used
in
foods,
drugs
and
cosmetics
without
restriction
and
that
the
data
we
had
submitted
showed
positively
that
it
was
not
harmless
for
use
in
all
those
products.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
now,
that
was
the
basis
of
the
decision.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
secretary
handled
the
broad
question
properly
but
gave
us
--
i
believe
you,
yourself
put
it,
some
relevance
to
the
economic
factor.
and
as
the
dissenting
chief
justice,
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
economic
factors
were
allowed
to
overweigh
the
words
of
the
statute
and
the
facts
on
which
the
secretary
acted.
now
finally,
my
opponents
do
not
argue
that
this
color
can
be
used
in
an
unrestricted
way
in
foods.
they
are
suggesting
they
are
tendered
to
you
as
that
--
the
secretary
be
ordered
to
restrict
it
to
two
or
three
foods
and
to
fix
tolerances.
our
entry
is
that
the
only
statutory
basis
for
that
is
406
(a),
which
we
believe
is
not
applicable.
we
feel
that
if
new
law,
if
tolerances
ought
to
be
established,
if
we
ought
to
undertake
this
grave
responsibility
of
fixing
safe
levels
of
unknown
poison
in
food,
we
should
have
a
policy
mandate
from
congress
to
do
so.
we
have
handled
insecticide
differently
from
colors
because
congress
told
us
to
do
so.
and
fixed
upon
the
department,
the
great
responsibility
of
regulating
highly
toxic,
insecticidal
substances
at
levels
which
was
--
from
which
no
harm
would
come.
every
time
congress
has
opened
the
food
supply
to
the
danger
from
poisons,
however,
they
have
done
so
cautiously
and
certainly
the
word
“harmless”
does
not
indicate
an
intent
to
venture
into
any
such
realm.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
one
of
the
statements
made
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
was
it
was
10
times
more
safe,
the
other
one,
it
was
50
times
more
safe.
since
we
don't
know
how
a
toxic
red
32
is,
no
such
comparison
can
be
drawn.
i
have
not
studied
the
scientific
presentation.
i
understand
that
it
was
presented
to
the
department.
that
our
toxicologist
said
on
the
basis
of
the
scientific
study
made,
he
could
not
classify
that
color
as
a
harmless
substance
in
a
pharmacological
sense
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
that
if
congress
wishes
to
undertake
this,
then,
congress
can
say
so.
it
has
not
been
undermined
of
the
peculiar
situation
in
which
the
orange
growers
find
themselves.
thank
you.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
w.
goodrich
no.
it
has
never
been
suggested
for
anything
other
than
our
appeal,
artificial
coloring.
thank
you.
