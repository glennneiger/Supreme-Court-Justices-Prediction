harmless,
you
mean
in
the
sense
at
which
it's
wholly
and
indisputably
innocuous
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
put
it
this
way,
it's
a
--
who
decided
this
case
in
that
favor,
the
judgment
(inaudible)
and
effective
from
march
1,
1959.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
we
held
that
harmless
meant
harmless
(inaudible)
therefore
we
gave
no
certification,
the
color
could
not
be
used.
now,
(inaudible)
the
proviso
would
permit
use
of
the
color
though
uncertified
until
march.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
after
that,
our
decision
would
by
then
take
effect.
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
that's
a
question
for
congress
and
not
the
board
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
at
this
point?
assuming
that
you
give
406
(b)
harmless
in
406
(b)
the
meaning
that
you
suggest
should
be
given,
less
than
absolute,
what
in
that
event
would
section
406
(b)
have
accomplished
that
wasn't
already
accomplished
under
406
(a)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
i
mean
is
if
you
didn't
have
406
(b),
406
(a)
which
does
permit
tolerances
would
cover,
of
course,
coal-tar
colors.
since
406
(b)
and
that's
a
separate
provision,
of
course,
for
coal-tar
colors
which
says
that
they
have
to
be
harmless.
if
you'd
have
construed
harmless
as
meaning
less
than
absolute,
you're
not
adding
anything
to
406
to
the
statute
by
--
by
enacting
406
(b),
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
because
of
the
existence
of
406
(b).
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
isn't
--
it
didn't
have
406
(b)
down
(inaudible)
secretary
was
under
that
to
have
been
able
to
apply
color
(inaudible)
isn't
that
right?
