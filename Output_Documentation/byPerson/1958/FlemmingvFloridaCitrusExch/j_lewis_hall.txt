mr.
j.
lewis
hall
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
about
where
mr.
peterson
has
left
all
in
the
matter
of
the
possibility
of
new
color
because
i
think
that
is
the
importance
of
this
case.
my
agreement
of
counsel,
arranged
through
one
of
our
state
officials,
we
were
permitted
to
inform
this
court
outside
the
record
of
the
fact
that
some
$170,000
has
been
spent
to
this
time
in
the
development
of
a
new
color,
which
has
only
1/10
of
the
toxicity
of
the
red
32,
which
color
was
used
for
many
years
for
the
coloring
of
oranges
without
a
single
complaint.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
if
your
honor
please,
as
i
will
give
the
court
my
understanding.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
--
1/10
of
the
toxicity,
that
is
of
an
equal
amount
of
red
32
and
an
equal
amount
of
the
new
color
--
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
oh,
yes.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
that
means
that
if
it
is
taken
in
sufficient
quantities,
it
will
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
human
or
the
animal
which
takes
it.
now,
no
one
denies.
there
isn't
any
argument
here
at
all
that
if
given
in
massive
doses,
that
red
32
will
have
an
adverse
effect.
now,
let's
--
let
me
go
to
the
question
of
harmless.
i
don't
quite
think
that
our
opposition
here
has
been
fully
presented.
harmless
as
it
was
testified
to
before
the
congress
as
it
was
used,
we
contend
in
regulations
that
harmless
means
without
capacity
to
harm
or
without
the
probability
or
possibility
of
harm
when
used
for
the
purposes
intended
and
in
the
amounts
for
which
it
was
designed.
now,
in
coloring
of
oranges,
we
have
four
parts
per
million,
but
as
these
tests
were
fed
at
100
parts
per
million
and
400
parts
per
million.
so
if
--
if
your
honor
please,
if
harmless
is
to
be
construed
in
its
absolute
sense.
that
is
that
it
is
without
the
capacity
to
harm
in
no
matter
what
amount
and
no
whatever
--
for
whatever
purpose
used
then
we
can
never
qualify
that
new
color.
now,
we
are
--
we
are
in
--
in
this
position
as
--
as
part
of
--
of
citrus
industry.
first,
if
the
word
'harmless'
is
construed
to
mean,
harmless
in
the
--
in
the
amounts
used
and
for
the
purposes
used
then
we
can
design
a
color
that
can
be
used
for
the
coloring
of
oranges
without
danger
to
public
health,
but
if
the
department's
interpretation
is
correct
and
that
is
that
all
color
must
be
absolutely
harmless
and
if
they
are
fairly
correct,
that
they
will
not
--
do
not
have
the
power
to
establish
the
tolerances
for
the
use
of
that
color
for
the
purposes
for
which
it's
designed.
then
we
can
never
qualify
a
color
that
will
color
oranges.
now,
i
don't
--
there
are
--
there
are
statistics
in
the
brief
as
to
the
importance
of
the
color
of
oranges.
suffice
it
to
say
that
it's
recognized
in
numerous
official
publications
and
is
an
economic
fact
of
life
in
the
citrus
industry
that
the
public
mistakenly
associates
the
color
of
the
orange
with
maturity
and
as
mr.
peterson
has
explained,
there
is
no
relation.
a
great
many
times,
the
orange
has
a
beautiful
orange
color
before
it
is
mature
and
the
late
orange
has
the
--
the
green
color
before
the
maturity.
so
--
but
the
public
has
associated
that
over
the
years
and
with
the
approval
over
the
years
of
agricultural
economists
and
officials,
we
have
developed
in
the
mind
of
the
public
that
association
between
the
color
and
maturity
when
in
the
state
of
nature
such
is
not
true.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
it
would
be
hard
to
say,
your
honor,
but
let
me
say
this.
there
was
not
1/10
of
the
market
for
oranges
before
color
added
was
used
that
has
been
developed
since
that
time.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
and
there
is
an
immediate
--
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
i
--
i
submitted
as
relevant
for
this
reason.
of
all
of
the
foods
that
might
need
the
aid
of
color,
the
orange
was
the
only
one
that
receives
special
recognition
from
congress
in
this
act
and
special
provisions
were
made
by
the
congress
in
the
proviso
by
the
continued
coloring
of
oranges
until
these
listings
could
take
place.
i
think
that
the
congress
recognized
the
economic
importance
of
the
color
of
oranges
and
therefore,
i
say
that
of
all
the
other
foods
that
might
need
the
use
of
color,
we
claim
for
the
orange
the
best
ground
for
our
basis,
for
our
claim
because
the
congress
and
the
enactment
of
this
law
specifically
recognized
the
need
of
color
for
oranges
and
did
not
so
recognize
it
for
any
other
food.
and
then,
of
course,
if
your
honor
please,
we'd
go
back
to
the
fundamental
rule
of
construction
that
a
statute
is
to
be
construed
to
accomplish
its
purpose
and
it
will
not
be
construed
to
--
to
create
great
inconvenience,
inequality
or
injustice
unless
it's
necessary
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
main
purpose
of
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question,
but
let
me
say
what
--
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
if
your
honor
please,
they
take
the
position.
i
mean,
the
department
takes
the
position
that
406
(a)
with
its
power
in
the
department
to
establish
tolerances
for
particular
uses
doesn't
apply
to
coal-tar
color.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
they
say
that
the
--
that
--
that
applies
only
to
when
--
when
the
use
of
the
poison
is
necessary
in
production.
that's
only
toward
406
(a)
as
they
say
that
if
it's
necessary
in
production
then
we
have
the
power
to
establish
tolerance.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
if
your
honor
please,
i
contend
that
he
has
the
power
to
establish
tolerances
under
406
(a).
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
because
the
reference
of
the
certification
of
these
coal-tar
colors
in
402
says
that
the
food
shall
be
considered
adulterated
if
it
contains
a
coal-tar
color
not
listed
under
the
regulations
contained
in
406.
not
406
(a)
or
406
(b),
but
406.
we
contend
that
that
makes
them
--
that
406
(b)
makes
it
mandatory
as
the
coal-tar
colors
because
of
the
economic
necessity
in
the
coloring
of
citrus
fruit
and
nearly
permissive
as
to
406
(a).
we
--
we
have
a
little
slant,
a
different
interpretation
to
that.
the
406
(a)
is
permissive,
406
(b)
is
mandatory.
that
congress
recognized
and
amended
the
act
to
make
the
--
the
listing
of
coal-tars
that
were
harmless
and
suitable
for
use
in
food
a
mandatory
duty.
and
the
--
the
citrus
industry
was
--
the
congress
was
informed
that
the
citrus
--
citrus
industry's
problem
at
the
time
that
that
act
was
being
written.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
we
submit
further
that
in
addition
to
the
fundamental
rules
of
construction
that
would
indicate
that
harmless
is
not
to
be
given
its
absolute
meaning,
we
contend
that
our
contention
is
supported
by
the
logic
of
the
structure
of
this
act.
because
harmless
is
used
in
this
act
three
times,
the
word
"harmless"
and
the
secretary
is
required
to
certify
coal-tar
colors
suitable
for
use
in
food,
suitable
for
use
in
drugs
and
suitable
for
use,
harmless
and
suitable
for
use
in
cosmetics.
and
in
the
coal-tar
regulations
promulgated
in
1940
of
--
of
greater
allowance
of
poisonous
materials
will
allow
the
in
colors
that
were
to
be
certified
only
for
cosmetics
and
drugs
and
was
allowed
to
be
committed
--
permitted
in
the
colors
that
were
to
be
certified
for
food.
so,
in
the
very
structure
of
the
act
itself
and
in
the
departmental
interpretation,
they
have
interpreted
harmless
to
mean
for
the
uses
of
the
--
intended
and
the
purposes
intended
and
the
amounts
it
was
used.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
well,
it
takes
judicial
notice
of
the
bank
that
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida
specifically
forbid
the
coloring
of
oranges
except
the
oranges
which
have
arrived
at
the
maximum
state
of
sweetness
and
maturity
and
acidity.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
no,
sir.
because
we've
always
felt
that
the
--
that
the
department
here
would
take
care
of
the
color
situation
and
our
state
simply
required
the
maturity
of
the
orange
before
the
color
could
be
used
on
it.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
if
your
honor
please,
let
--
let
me
start
a
little
further
back
and
see
if
i
can
bring
a
logical
answer
here.
let
me
say
this,
that
the
test
designed
in
1938,
when
this
law
was
passed,
they
say
that
various
levels
to
ascertain
the
level
at
which
animals
could
take
this
food
without
bad
results
and
we
think
that
was
the
proper
approach.
as
here
is
a
dye
or
a
--
a
color
submitted
that
it
is
useful
economically.
and
they
said
how
much
is
it
going
to
be
possible
for
us
to
determine
that
it
is
safe
for
human
consumption
and
use
in
foods
and
they
say
that
relatively
low
levels
and
they
came
up
with
the
conclusion
that
it
could
be
used
in
those
amounts
and
if
that
amount
was
far
in
excess
of
that
use
for
coloring
oranges
or
other
purposes,
and
it
was
listed
as
a
harmless
color.
now,
the
test
which
were
conducted
in
1952
and
1953
were
conducted
for
an
entirely
different
purpose,
admittedly
so,
by
the
governments'
brief.
they
tested
only
to
see
if
the
color
could
be
given
in
such
massive
amounts
that
it
would
produce
an
adverse
effect
and
of
course,
it
did.
but
there
has
been
no
effort
to
determine
whether
or
not
red
32
can
be
used
in
safe
amounts.
so,
we
contend
that
we
--
that
the
citrus
industry
of
the
state
of
florida
will
face
economic
disaster,
unless,
this
statute
is
construed,
meaning
that
a
color
can
be
developed
for
the
use
and
coloring
oranges
and
that
the
department
has
the
power
to
limit
the
use
of
that
color
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
designed
and
brought
in
the
bill.
and
we
have
a
new
color.
we
spent
nearly
$200,000
that
is
designed
for
the
coloring
of
oranges.
it
has
10
times
a
safety
margin
and
yet
we
take
it
to
the
department
and
they
say,
"it's
toxic."
you
can
feed
enough
of
it
to
a
dog
over
a
long
enough
period
of
time
and
will
make
him
sick.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
i'm
not
quite
sure,
your
honor.
don't
misunderstand
me.
i'm
not
worried
about
the
--
the
color.
i'm
worried
about
how
far
my
gentleman's
agreement
as
to
what
i
can
tell
the
court.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
but
the
--
the
color
--
but
under
the
department's
and
under
the
second
circuit's
interpretation,
we
can't
develop
a
color
and
take
it
in
and
say,
"we
want
this
certified
for
the
purpose
of
coloring
oranges
and
we
want
it
--
you
to
establish
the
tolerances
that
will
guarantee
you
that
when,
so
used,
it
--
the
public
health
will
be
protected.
and
we
contend
that
this
statute
is
susceptible
of
that
interpretation,
that
it
lies
in
the
logic
of
the
congressional
intent
that
the
word
“harmless”
means
for
purposes
for
which
it's
used
and
the
manner
in
which
it's
used.
and
if
we
can
present
--
and
we
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
red
32
is
safe
and
they
can
prescribe
the
tolerances
and
those
tolerances
will
protect
the
public
health
and
still
let
us
color
oranges.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
in
conclusion
that
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
this
case
very
much
like
a
chancellor
who
had
tried
to
evaluate
a
set
of
facts
with
the
wrong
conception
of
the
law
applicable
to
those
facts.
well,
here
we
have
the
department
that
started
out
with
test
designed
for
a
purpose
which
was
not
within
the
contemplation
law
that
was
designed
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was.
so,
we
say
that
the
interpretation,
actually,
was
erroneous.
and
that
it
is
possible
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
secretary
as
did
the
fifth
circuit
to
find
out
the
safe
level
of
use
of
red
32,
if
there
is
such
a
safe
use,
and
then
if
he
establish
the
tolerances
for
its
use
and,
it
then,
for
having
established
that,
to
promulgate
the
regulations
for
the
use
of
that
color
under
those
safeguards.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
if
your
honor
please,
we
don't
think
we
need
congressional
permission.
we
think
that
it's
inherent
in
this
act
and
that
all
we
need
is
that
the
--
this
court
to
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit,
that
the
department
already
has
the
power
to
limit
the
use
of
that
color
to
a
particular
purpose
and
to
prescribe
the
amounts
that
can
be
used
for
that
purpose
and
we
will
present
them
with
a
dye
that
will
meet
those
requirements,
provided
this
court
also
says
that
harmless
does
mean
absolute
purity.
we
say
that
if
you
--
if
you
say
that
harmless
means
that
this
color
is
safe
for
the
purpose
for
which
it's
designed
and
in
the
amounts,
which
is
used
with
authority
and
the
secretary
to
prescribe
the
amounts
and
restrict
the
uses
and
purposes,
our
problems
are
solved.
the
department
has
all
the
authority
it
needs
to
protect
the
public
health.
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
said.
they
didn't
attempt
to
substitute
their
judgment.
they
simply
knew
that
this
test,
admittedly,
conducted
for
the
wrong
purpose
and
with
the
long
list
--
conception
of
the
law
had
no
validity
because
they
were
not
designed
to
--
to
produce
the
data
to
determine
the
safety
of
the
color
but
to
prove
that
the
color
could
be
used
in
a
manner
that
was
unsafe.
and
there's
a
tremendous
distinction.
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
let's
say
first
that
the
court
to
define
what
the
word
"harmless"
means
in
this
statute
when
applied
to
colors.
second,
to
construe
the
act
as
to
whether
or
not
he
can
limit
the
use
of
a
color
to
a
single
food
or
one
or
two
food
--
two
or
three
more
foods.
and
third,
that
if
harmless
is
a
relative
term
and
he
has
the
power
to
restrict
it
to
one
food
to
establish
the
tolerances
in
what
amounts
then
all
of
the
argument
here
of
the
--
of
the
department
that
we
can't
do
this,
we
can't
because
we
don't
know
how
many
people
will
eat,
how
many
foods,
all
of
that
goes
out
the
window
as
--
as
of
no
validity.
because
if
this
court
says,
and
i
think
that
it
lies
in
--
as
i
said,
in
the
logic
of
the
structure
of
this
act,
where
they
say
that
he
can
certify
a
harmless
and
suitable
for
this
use,
harmless
and
suitable
for
this
use
and
harmless
and
suitable,
where
it
says
harmless
and
suitable
for
use
in
foods,
harmless
and
suitable
for
use
in
drugs,
harmless
and
suitable
for
use
in
cosmetics,
we
think
he's
got
the
power
to
say,
"harmless
and
suitable
for
use
in
oranges
if
restricted
to
this
amount."
mr.
j.
lewis
hall
yes,
sir.
but
if
he
wants
--
if
he
--
he's
afraid
that
they're
going
to
ingest
2500
oranges
a
day
and
get
poisoned,
we
want
him
to
say
that
this
can
be
limited
so
that
they'll
have
to
eat
3000,
four
parts
per
million.
we
are
not
afraid
of
any
tolerance
that
can
be
established
because
four
parts
per
million
is
so
infinitesimal
in
comparison.
let
me
give
you
the
illustration,
2500
oranges,
peeling
and
all,
to
ingest
enough
of
this
color
on
a
weight
basis
that
was
used
to
make
the
rats
sick
and
the
dogs
eat.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
to
show
you
that
the
court
--
that
the
department
has
taken
that
very
attitude
toward
colors
other
than
no
use
to
color
oranges.
in
--
as
late
as
1950
in
the
official
publications,
the
department
approved
the
use
of
a
color
called
violet
no.
1
and
specifically
admitted
that
it
could
be
bad
in
such
large
amounts
that
it
would
produce
an
adverse
effect,
but
said
that
in
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
used
and
in
the
amounts,
no
human
being
would
by
any
possibility
suffer
adverse
effect.
all
we
want
is
that
applied
to
oranges.
