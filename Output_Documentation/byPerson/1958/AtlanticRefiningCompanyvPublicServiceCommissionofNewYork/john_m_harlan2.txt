justice
john
m.
harlan
what
price
the
order
passed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
examiner's
original
order,
the
price,
i
would
like
to
know
did
the
commission
questioned
the
price
under
580
(inaudible)
--?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
fact
what
the
commission
can
do
is
to
say
no,
we
won't
do
this,
have
a
lower
price
and
then
let
you
test
out
the
price
before
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
power
commission's
brief
as
i
understand
is
that
they
are
not
asking
us
to
have
this
case
to
reverse.
the
thing
that
they're
interested
in,
the
fact
is
the
i
don't
quite
understand
it
but
it
is
that
this
case
can
be
affirmed
that
the
basic
question
as
they
discussed
and
you
were
discussing
is
something
that
ought
not
to
be
determined
in
this
context,
and
therefore
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me,
i
understood
your
advisory
to
say
that
you
agreed,
there
did
not
have
to
be
a
rate
determination,
just
a
reasonable
rate
determination
in
a
section
7
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
is
the
lower
limit
of
the
discretion,
the
commission's
discretion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
be,
a
company
would
be,
producer
is
not
then
willing
to
work
committed
to
interstate
commerce,
on
what
the
commission
would
like
to
have
it
do,
what
happens
then?
the
commission
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
am
just
putting
the
question
to
you.
that's
the
way
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
taking
that
position,
it
might
have
been
a
larger
public
interest
in
stagnant
supplies.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
first
order
shows
that
it
did
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
–
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
they
said
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
made
the
point
that
the
commission
having
proposed
what
you
say
would
have
been
agreeable
to
you
namely
a
section
4
proceeding
which
would
have
been
effectuated
by
new
filing
one
day
after
the
certificate
issued.
the
commission
being
faced
with
a
refusal
by
the
suppliers
to
accept
that,
(inaudible)
for
the
choice
is
to
whether
they
were
going
to
get
this
gas
supply
or
accept
or
decline
a
certificate.
how
do
meet
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
your
position
have
been
different
if
there
had
been
express
findings
that
this
source
of
supply,
the
importance
of
this
source
of
supply
overrode
the
price
consideration,
would
your
position
have
been
different
here
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
are
no
such
findings
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
then
your
quarrel
really
is
narrower,
namely
that
there
are
not
adequate
findings
here
to
support
what
you
would
recognize
the
commission
would
have
the
right
to
do
with
proper
findings.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
have
a
5
(a)
avenue;
you
say
it's
an
inefficient
one.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
they
have
that,
so
they
are
not
(inaudible)
public
protection,
but
if
there
were
such
findings,
would
you
then
agree
that
the
commission
could
have
done
what
it
undertook
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
absence
of
findings
is
--
there
is
an
absence.
it
makes
no
difference
to
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
put
one
more
question
here
really
just
to
orient
myself
–-
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
supposing
in
practice
a
section
5
proceeding
was
just
as
expeditious
as
a
section
4
(e)
proceeding,
would
that
make
a
difference
to
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
am
assuming
if
you
could,
because
of
an
increased
commission
staff,
or
because
of
falling
off
of
business,
or
what
not,
that
you
could
(inaudible)
expeditious
determination,
what
would
be
your
position
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
correct
thinking
that
the
examiner
excluded
all
evidence
with
respect
to
price?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
am
really
getting
at
was
there
evidence
in
the
record
support
this
finding
of
the
commission
that
you
call
attention
to?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
source
that,
considered
to
be,
to
getting
the
source
of
supply
was
more
important
than
the
price?
