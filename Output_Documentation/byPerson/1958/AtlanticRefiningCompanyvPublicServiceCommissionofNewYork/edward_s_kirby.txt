mr.
edward
s.
kirby
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
these
cases
i
represent
public
service
electric
&
gas
company
which
is
a
gas
distribution
public
utility
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
we
serve
over
1,100,000
customers
and
have
large
purchases
of
natural
gas
from
three
pipeline
companies.
we
purchased
for
example
a
1958
already
8
million
mcf
of
natural
gas,
which
by
coincidence
is
slightly
larger
than
the
entire
amount
which
will
be
delivered
at
tennessee
under
these
contracts
per
year.
now,
we
are
rightly
interested
in
the
field
price
of
gas
in
these
cases
because
the
field
price
of
gas
is
a
large
element
in
the
price
which
the
pipeline
company
charges
the
distribution
company.
now,
in
my
argument,
first,
i
would
like
to
try
and
cover
two
points
which
i
felt
were
prompted
by
questions
from
the
bench
yesterday
and
these
two
points
are
(a)
the
rate
making
standard
of
the
act
in
connection
with
the
commission's
discretion
in
a
section
7
proceeding
and
2
or
(b),
what's
a
touch
off
commission
action,
and
what
evidence
is
necessary
where
it
appears
a
producer
is
seeking
too
high
of
price?
taking
up
the
first
point,
i
agree
that
the
commission
has
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
which
it
may
use
in
the
section
7
proceeding.
and
in
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
it
need
not
make
a
finding
of
just
and
reasonableness
with
respect
to
the
initial
rate
in
every
case.
what
this
discretion
must
be
exercised
within
the
framework
and
policy
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
cases
for
example
which
express
that
policy
are
the
hope
case
and
the
phillips
case,
and
the
policy
as
this
court
interpreted
was
namely
to
protect
consumers
from
exploitation
at
the
hands
of
natural
gas
companies.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
said
it
need
not
make
a
finding
of
just
and
reasonableness
in
a
section
7
proceeding
with
respect
to
the
initial
rate.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
not
in
every
case,
if
for
example
--
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
in
this
case,
yes.
that
is
our
position,
in
this
case,
they
should
not
issue
the
certificate
without
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
some
provision
to
protect
the
consumer.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
some
provision
to
protect
the
consumer
in
the
meantime.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
no,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
all
right.
i
think
i
can
answer
that
right
here
your
honor.
i
say
that
the
commission's
discretion
in
a
section
7(4)
proceeding
must
recognize
that
section
4
points
out
that
this
is
a
price
oriented
statute
and
that
section
7
provides
all
rates
must
be
just
and
reasonable,
and
if
they
are
not,
they
are
declared
to
be
unlawful.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
no,
i
think
i
will
come
right
to
it.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
all
right!
let
me
just
say
it
your
honor.
section
4
does
not
exclude
initial
prices
paid
to
producers.
however,
and
this
is
the
point
i
think
that
answers
your
question,
the
precise
time
at
which
the
commission
must
make
such
a
determination
of
just
and
reasonableness
maybe
left
to
a
later
time,
outside
the
section
7
proceeding,
after
it
has
concluded
provided,
and
only
if,
it
protects
the
consumer
in
the
meantime,
the
waiting
period.
as
this
court
said
in
the
hope
case
at
320
us
at
page
611,
the
federal
power
commission
was
given
broad
powers
of
regulation
for
fixing
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
under
section
4
with
the
powers
attended
there
too,
was
the
heart
of
the
new
regulatory
system.
i
believe
justice
harlan
asked
mr.
brown
yesterday
a
question
to
this
effect.
isn't
the
nub
of
the
problem
that
producers
want
a
section
5
proceeding
and
you
want
a
section
4
proceeding?
the
unequivocal
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
but
it
must
be
understood
that
there
is
no
way
to
provide
for
a
section
4
proceeding
unless
a
condition
calling
forth
is
placed
in
the
certificate
which
is
issued
in
the
section
7
proceeding.
in
other
words,
the
two
must
be
in
conjunction
because
you
cannot
initiate
a
section
4
proceeding,
the
pipeline
itself
must
do
that
or
the
producer
rather
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
absolutely
right.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
that's
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
if
you
have
no
price
pegging,
or
for
that
period
of
time
until
the
section
5
made
the
initiative.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
it's
one
of
them.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
you're
right
and
the
case
itself,
the
section
4
takes
great
time.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
pardon
me,
section
5
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
that's
exactly
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
i
think
it
is.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
yes
sir
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
exactly
the
point
right
there.
i
think
that
was
the
nub
of
the
dissent
of
commissioner
kline
when
he
said
it
was
a
hopson's
choice
before
the
commission
to
either
deny
the
certificates
or
something
to
that
effect.
now,
i
would
say
this.
the
plain
answer
to
that
question
is
found
in
the
statute
itself,
and
the
statute,
i
am
just
speaking
of
the
natural
gas
act,
section
7
proceeding
says,
there
were
two
requisites
that
the
commission
must
find
before
it
can
issue
a
certificate
one
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
it
at
the
price
level
proposed
and
number
two
that
the
applicants
are
willing
and
able
to
perform
the
act.
now,
in
this,
in
the
question
that
your
honor
proposed
is
the
applicants
are
unwilling
to
accept
the
first
and
second
orders
in
this
case
which
would
protect
the
public,
the
consumers.
they
said
no,
we
won't
accept
that.
then
the
commission,
and
here
is
where
i
think
the
error
was,
agreed
to
them
and
issued
it
without
any
condition.
i
say
they
had
no
discretion
at
that
point
because
the
statute
says
you
must
in
that
case
deny
the
certificates.
they
should
have
denied
the
certificates,
they
have
to.
that's
what
the
statute
requires
them
to
do
when
they
find
an
unwilling
applicant.
otherwise
it
says,
the
certificates
must
be
denied.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
on
that
question
there
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
no,
there
aren't
because
twice,
in
the
first
two
orders,
in
the
first
order
and
the
second
order,
the
commission
both
times
said,
the
record
contains
insufficient
evidence
from
which
this
commission
can
make
a
finding
or
determination
that
the
certificate
should
issue
at
the
rate
level
proposed.
therefore
we
have
to
condition
it.
so,
they
didn't
have
the
requisite
evidence
in
the
first
and
second,
but
in
the
third,
they
just
gave
that
off.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
well,
your
honor
then
stating
that,
they
have
a
right
to
balance
the
need
against
price
when
they
have
the
evidence
as
to
both
the
elements.
they
didn't
have
it
here,
but
if
they
had
those
two,
i
suppose
in
their
discretion,
they
can
do
that,
but
they
must
protect
the
public
against
an
unlawful
price.
if
the
price
is
so
high
that
they
know
from
the
start
that
it's
going
to
probably
be
unreasonable,
they
can't
say
well,
we'll
let
you
have
the
price
because
the
need
overcomes
it,
they
have
to
say
we
have
to
go
back
to
section
4
--
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
no
your
honor
because
i
have
to
say
that
if
they
found
that
there
was
a
great
need,
and
they
found
that
the
price
was
extremely
high
or
unreasonable,
but
they
balanced
the
two.
i
say
they
can't
do
that
because
an
unreasonable
price
cannot
be
the
basis
of
a
certificate
or
any
action
or
any
rate
under
the
act.
they
are
bound
in
their
discretion
by
section
4
of
the
act.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
it
makes
the
difference
because
the
case
is
stronger
against
the
producers
where
they
have
put
in
no
evidence
as
to
the
request
for
this
higher
price.
there
was
no
evidence
on
which
it
could
be
balanced.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
not
one
bit.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
not
--
it
makes
it
stronger,
but
it
would
not.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
it's
the
same.
the
section
5
doesn't
protect
the
public
during
that
interval
however
long
it
may
be.
well,
to
get
back
to
the
second
order,
it
guarantee
to
producers
at
least
at
just
and
reasonable
rate.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
if
it
could
be
just
as
expeditious?
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
well
it
would
not
make
a
difference
because
the
burden
of
proof
is
shifted
over
to
the
commission
at
that
type
of
a
proceeding
and
you
couldn't
possibly
when
you
have
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
and
you
don't
have
the
evidence,
the
producers
have
their
evidence,
and
it's
usually
cost
or
something
like
that,
you
couldn't
possibly
do
it
as
expeditiously
as
a
section
4
because
there
the
producer
would
come
in
with
everything
all
prepared.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
well,
then
you
would
be
--
if
we
were
under
all
those
rules,
it
would
be
curing
the
defect,
that
is,
exposing
the
consumer
for
a
long
period
of
time.
you
would
cure
that,
and
if
he
can
be
protected
almost
as
fast,
then
i
couldn't
see
any
difference,
except
that
burden
of
proof
which
is
a
terrible
burden
which
was
placed
on
the
commission.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
i
think
it
has
to
be
recognized
whenever
you
look
at
it.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
because
section
5
your
honor
would
not
protect
the
consumer
over
that
long
period
of
time.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
well,
i
choose
4
instead
of
5
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
the
third
circuit
court
has
agreed
with
us
when
they
said
in
their
decision
section
5
is
no
remedy
at
all.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
well,
they
said
--
i've
got
to
give
the
exact
language
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
they
said,
well
there
is
not
an
adequate
remedy
and
therefore
it
amounts
to
no
remedy
at
all.
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
that
is
right.
but,
i
must
say
that
the
section
5
did
not
protect
the
consumer
in
this
case
because
it
placed
the
risk
on
consumer
of
having
paid
this
excess
if
there
is
any
over
this
period
of
time
with
no
possibility
of
refund.
it
shifted
as
i
said
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
commission,
and
actually,
it
exposed
the
consumer
by
the
shift
from
the
second
order
to
the
third
order,
it
exposed
the
consumer
to
a
liability
to
pay
per
year
up
to
$4
million
in
excess
rates
based
on
these
figures.
that
is,
that
would
be
if
the
rate
later
on
were
determined
to
be
17
cents,
maybe
two
years
from
now
or
three
years
from
now,
having
in
mind
how
long
it
takes
to
now
complete
a
section
5a
within
the
matters
of
years,
four
or
five
years.
these
very
petitioners
here,
three
of
them
had
section
5
(a)
complaints
filed
against
them
in
august
of
1955
by
the
tennessee
public
utility
commission
and
they
haven't
been
heard
yet
or
they
have
started
some
hearings
but
they
haven't
been
completed,
so
that
we
have
no
prospect
of
knowing
when
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
continental,
tidewater,
and
atlantic
refining
is
going
to
be
determined.
it's
somewhere
in
the
future.
now
as
i
said
before,
the
second
order
protected
all
parties
because
the
consumer
was
protected
from
the
17
cent
level
to
the
21
point
by
virtue
of
the
refunding
provisions
of
the
act,
that
is
under
the
section
4(e)
proceeding.
it
has
a
refunding
and
finding
provision
which
is
section
5
does
not
have,
and
that's
another
reason
i
prefer
before
proceeding.
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
edward
s.
kirby
i
will
just
conclude
by
stating
that
in
the
first
and
second
orders
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
insufficient
evidence
to
certificate
the
proceedings
on
the
basis
of
price
at
this
price
level
and
urge
that
the
third
circuit
court
be
upheld.
