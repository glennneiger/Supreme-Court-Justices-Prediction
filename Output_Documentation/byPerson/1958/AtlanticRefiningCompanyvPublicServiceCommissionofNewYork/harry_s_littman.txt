mr.
harry
s.
littman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
present
my
very
brief
argument
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
pipeline
company,
my
client,
tennessee
gas
transmission
company,
which
was
buying
this
gas.
we
operate
a
long
distance
pipeline
that
extends
from
the
gas
fields
in
texas
and
louisiana,
way
into
new
england.
now
along
the
route
of
this
line,
we
supply
gas
to
some
80
utility
costumers.
in
1956,
as
is
our
custom,
almost
annually,
we
made
a
canvas
for
our
costumers
to
determine
their
future
needs
for
gas
and
we
learned
that
some
50
of
the
80
wanted
additional
gas
supplies.
and
so
we
filed
with
federal
power
commission
in
a
separate
proceeding,
which
i'll
call
the
pipeline
proceeding,
docket
g1107
is
what
it's
designated,
an
application
or
a
certificate
to
authorize
the
installation
of
a
very
large
expansion
program
which
would
increase
our
capacity
by
come
450
million
cubic
feet
a
day.
the
cost
of
the
installation
of
the
additional
pipe
and
compressor
stations
would
cost
us
about
$175
million.
now,
obviously
in
order
to
achieve
this
very
ambitious
and
substantial
program
to
give
our
customers
the
additional
service
which
they
wanted,
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
go
out
and
obtain
additional
gas
reserves.
at
that
time,
the
only
large
gas
reserve
available
to
us,
that
was
for
sale
at
that
time,
in
the
area
of
our
lines,
was
this
particular
two
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas,
which
we
purchased
from
these
four
producers,
who
are
the
petitioners
in
case
number
518.
the
contract
was
negotiated
over
a
period
of
10
or
11
months
in
the
hardest
kind
of
bare-knuckle
bargaining
in
which
we
tried
to
get
the
best
price
we
could
for
that
gas
and
the
contract
was
entered
into
certainly
at
arm's
length,
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that.
the
evidence
also
shows
that
the
acquisition
of
this
gas
reserve
was
of
great
benefit
to
tennessee
and
its
customers.
it
was
a
very
large
reserve.
it
constitutes
some
12%
of
our
present
gas
supply.
it
was
well
located
with
reference
to
our
lines
being
only
about
60
miles
away
from
our
main
transmission
system.
the
price
was
not
very
far
out
of
line;
certainly
only
it
was
21.4
cents
per
thousand
cubic
feet
as
compared
with
20
cents
which
was
then
currently
being
paid
in
numerous
transactions
along
the
gulf
coast
on
dry
land
for
smaller
reserves
having
a
lesser
potential
and
being
smaller
in
size
than
this
reserve.
so
we
bought
this
gas,
we
went
to
hearing.
i
might
also
add
that
this
gas
gave
us
an
entrance
into
this
tremendously
prolific
reserve
out
in
the
gulf
coast,
out
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
where
we
could
of
course
have
access
to
still
additional
reserves
for
the
future
needs
of
our
customers.
at
the
hearing,
no
evidence
was
presented
showing
this
rate
to
be
unjust
or
unreasonable.
respondents
presented
no
evidence
at
all.
there
was
no
challenge
at
the
hearing
concerning
the
need
for
this
gas.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
three
orders
issued
in
this
case,
three
separate
certificate
orders.
it
is
the
third
one
that
is
here
under
review.
in
the
first
two
orders
there
were
findings
made
that
the
gas
was
needed
by
tennessee
as
well
as
in
the
third
order
and
in
those
first
two
orders,
respondents
took
no
exception
to
that
finding
although
they
now
begin
to
raise
some
questions
about
the
need
for
the
gas
in
their
appeal
on
the
third
order.
i
might
also
say
that
respondents,
while
they
were
interveners
and
active
participants
in
the
pipeline
phase
of
the
case
where
the
question
of
the
need
was
very
thoroughly
gone
into,
and
all
of
these
50
customers
and
their
witnesses
testified
concerning
their
needs,
they
raised
no
questions
there
concerning
the
need
for
the
gas
and
took
no
exceptions
to
the
certificates
that
were
offered,
that
were
granted
by
the
commission
in
which
orders
the
commission
found
that
the
gas
was
needed
and
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
the
installation
of
the
facilities
and
the
capacity.
now
the
order
under
review
contains
all
of
the
statutory
findings.
it
finds
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
these
sales
and
this
service.
it
finds
that
applicants
are
able
and
willing
to
render
the
service
and
that
they
are
ready
and
willing
to
conform
to
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
respondents
make
a
concession,
that
i
deem
of
utmost
importance
in
this
proceeding,
they
concede,
all
of
them
do
in
their
briefs
over
and
over
again
that
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
require
a
finding
of
justness
and
reasonableness
of
a
rate
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
a
certificate
proceeding.
and
that
was
advised
in
conceding
that
point
because
one
searches
the
four
corners
of
the
rate
sections
of
the
act
to
find
any
such
requirement
even
as
being
necessary
before
the
commission
can
make
effective
a
rate.
for
example,
new
rates,
that
is
the
initial
rates
cannot
be
suspended
as
respondents
concede,
therefore,
they
may
be
made
effective
without
any
finding
of
justness
and
reasonableness
under
the
statute.
rate
changes
may
be
made
effective
in
the
commission's
discretion
to
be
sure,
and
may
be
suspended
or
not
suspended
as
the
commission
pleases,
but
the
commission
can
make
them
effective
without
suspension
in
its
discretion
and
without
a
finding
of
justness
and
reasonableness.
and
in
the
mobile
case,
this
court
held
categorically
that
the
natural
gas
act
contemplates
that
all
rates
are
to
be
established
initially
by
the
natural
gas
companies
by
contract
or
otherwise
subject
to
review
by
the
commission
under
section
5.
therefore,
as
we
see
it
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
and
as
mr.
searls
has
correctly
stated
here,
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
commission
in
refusing
to
impose
a
price
condition
in
the
certificate
order,
we
submit
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion.
the
commission
explored
the
rate
aspects
of
the
matter
as
fully
as
was
practicable
under
the
circumstances.
its
three
orders
were
largely
concerned
with
and
contained
a
full
discussion
of
the
price
issue.
i
say
the
commission
explored
the
rate
aspects
as
fully
as
was
practical
short
of
a
full
blown
rate
case.
the
commission
concluded
upon
application
for
rehearing
and
i
would
like
to
quote
some
of
the
language,
because
i
think
it's
quite
revealing.
in
the
third
order
the
commission
finally
concluded
upon
our
rehearing,
upon
our
urgent
request
to
save
this
supply
of
gas
for
our
markets
and
our
customers
that
“important
as
is
the
issue
of
price,
the
precise
charge
that
is
made
initially
is
less
important
than
the
assurance
of
this
great
supply
of
gas”.
mr.
harry
s.
littman
yes,
your
honor,
that's
in
volume
2,
page
489
that's
in
the
smaller
of
the
two
volumes
and
that
“in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
in
view
of
the
great
demand
for
gas
by
customers
of
tennessee
gas,
the
price
consideration
should
not
be
made
the
prime
determinant
of
what
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
required.”
accordingly
the
commission
reversed
its
previous
order,
containing
the
price
condition
which
was
unacceptable
to
the
producers
and
it
instituted
section
5
investigations
against
the
four
producers
or
the
other
three,
pardon?
mr.
harry
s.
littman
it
is
on
the
page
487,
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
is
around
about
middle
of
the
page
there
and
the
commission
then
instituted
these
section
5(a)
rate
investigations
against
the
producers.
now
on
arriving
at
this
decision,
the
commission
had
before
it,
the
following
salient
facts
which
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
summarize,
which
compelled
it
to
reverse
its
earlier
order
and
save
this
great
supply
of
gas
for
our
customers.
first,
there
were
no
comparable
prices
in
the
area
here
involved
since
which
would
form
the
basis
of
a
price
condition,
since
this
was
the
first
sale
in
this
particular
offshore
field.
secondly,
as
mr.
searls
pointed
out
there,
the
price
here
involved
would
not
trigger
any
increases
in
our
other
gas
contracts
or
otherwise
cause
any
economic
disruption
in
the
producing
area.
thirdly,
the
need
for
the
gas
in
the
interstate
market
was
great
and
time
was
of
the
essence.
this
hearing
was
being
tried,
the
latter
part
of
february
and
early
part
of
march
of
1957.
our
customers
wanted
service
in
that
winter.
in
order
to
get
service
to
them,
we
had
to
build
this
tremendous
pipeline.
we
had
make
all
of
these
arrangements.
we
had
to
construct
underwater
marine
gathering
system
out
in
to
the
waters
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
connect
up
these
22
wells
and
additional
wells,
that
were
going
to
be
drilled,
we
had
to
a
tremendous
amount
of
work
to
get
that
job
done.
the
producers
told
us
that
they
were
going
to
cancel
their
contracts
unless
a
satisfactory
certificate
was
issued
to
them
by
april
1
as
was
their
right
to
cancel
under
the
agreements.
there
was
insufficient
time
as
respondents,
well,
i
am
sure,
they
admit
and
have
admitted
in
their
brief,
there
was
insufficient
time
within
which
to
conduct
a
full-blown
full-scale
rate
investigation.
it
takes
years
to
conduct
such
an
investigation.
the
respondents
concede
that
within
--
that
it
was
not
practicable
within
the
time
limitations
of
this
proceeding
to
convert
it,
to
convert
the
certificate
case
in
to
a
rate
case.
the
producers
as
i
said,
a
moment
ago
had
advised
us
definitely
that
they
were
going
to
cancel
their
contracts
and
thereafter
dispose
off
their
gas
in
intrastate
markets
rather
than
to
accept
the
certificates
issued
by
the
commission's
first
and
second
orders
and
i
might
say
that,
that
is
a
very
realistic
situations
with
which
we
are
confronted.
the
intrastate
markets
are
in
constant
competition
with
the
interstate
markets
for
this
gas.
for
example,
in
louisiana,
some
42%
of
the
gas
produced
there
is
sold
in
intrastate
commerce.
in
texas,
some
41%
and
in
oklahoma
some
62%
or
63%
is
in
interstate
commerce
and
so
we
weren't
the
only
customer
available
to
them
for
this
gas
and
there
is
no
means
under
the
natural
gas
act
whereby
a
producer
can
be
compelled
to
make
an
initial
sale
of
gas
to
an
interstate
pipeline
company,
and
so
it
was
at
our
urgent
request.
we
filed
the
petition
for
rehearing
with
the
commission
that
it
modified
its
second
order,
so
as
to
ensure
that
this
great
supply
of
gas
would
not
be
lost
to
the
interstate
market.
the
commission
properly
recognized,
the
overwhelming
importance
of
getting
this
gas
into
our
lines,
and
committed
to
interstate
commerce
so
that
thereafter
it
could
not
be
abandoned
without
an
application
first
being
made
and
permission
granted
under
the
abandonment
provisions
of
the
act
and
so
that
the
commission
could
thereafter
exercise
its
continuing
great
jurisdiction.
in
these
circumstances
we
respectively
submit,
that
the
commission
did
not
abuse
its
discretion.
now
the
respondents
extol
the
virtues
of
the
commission's
second
order
which
contained
this
price
condition.
they
hold
it
up
a
shining
example
of
a
very
beautiful
device
that
can
be
used
and
should
be
used
by
the
commission
to
control
producer
prices.
we
respectfully
disagree.
not
only
was
the
order
of
doubtful
legality
as
mr.
searls
has
already
explained,
but
it
didn't
make
good
economic
sense
and
for
this
reason,
the
commission
fixed
a
floor
of
17
cents
in
the
price
condition
and
said
here
you
can
charge
the
21.4
cents
said
to
the
producers.
you
can
charge
21.4
cents
while
we're
investigating
the
price,
but
you'll
have
to
refund
down
to
17
cents
if
we
should
find
after
investigation
that
the
price
is
too
high.
but
the
17
cents
was
the
floor,
and
why
did
they
select
the
17
cents
because
that
was
the
highest
price
that
tennessee
was
paying
to
any
other
producer.
now
that
would
put
us
if
this
is
the
pattern
to
be
followed
as
respondents
recommend
to
be
followed
and
if
that
had
been
the
vogue
of
the
day,
we
could
have
never
bought
this
gas
for
this
reason.
we
were
paying
17
cents
to
our
--
highest
price
to
our
producers,
than
anyone,
but
i
think
one
single
producer
was
receiving
that
much
no
more.
other
pipeline
companies
were
paying
18
cents,
others
were
paying
19
cents
and
some
were
paying
as
high
as
20
cents,
and
if
this
type
of
order
had
been
in
the
practice
at
that
time,
we
could
never
sell
this
gas
–
we
could
never
purchase
this
gas
because
obviously
producers
would
flock
to
the
company
that
was
paying
at
that
time
higher
prices
than
ourselves.
the
court
below
held
sue
sponte
that
the
rejection
by
the
producers
of
the
price
condition
automatically
divested
the
commission
of
its
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
applications.
now
we
agree
with
mr.
searls
most
wholeheartedly
that
the
court
below
was
clearly
wrong
and
so
hold
it.
as
the
respondents
themselves
recognize,
an
applicant
for
a
certificate
when
he
applies,
does
not,
by
the
filing
of
that
application
agree
to
accept
any
kind
of
the
certificate
that
the
commission
may
choose
to
issue.
indeed
the
commission's
rules
and
regulations
specifically
prescribe
that
a
certificate
doesn't
even
become
effective
unless
it
is
accepted
in
writing
by
the
applicant
within
30
days
after
its
issuance.
we
cite
on
page
35
of
our
main
brief
that's
the
buff
colored
brief,
the
legislative
history
which
we
think
conclusively
demonstrates
the
error
of
the
court
below.
and
now
one
final
word
about
the
position
of
the
new
york
public
service
commission,
they
say
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
been
derelict
in
its
duty
to
control
producer
prices
and
has
failed
to
do
its
job
in
stemming
the
tide
of
increase
in
producer
prices.
we
respectfully
disagree
and
submit
that
there
is
no
merit
to
that
contention.
since
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
the
philip's
case
in
june
of
1954,
the
federal
power
commission
has
suspended
over
$105
million,
now
that's
per
year,
of
annual
rate
increases.
not
only
that,
but
the
federal
power
commission
has
instituted
many
section
5a
rate
investigations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
of
the
present
time
i
think
it
is
fairly
correct
to
say,
that
practically
every
large
producer
of
natural
gas
in
the
country
is
under
a
rate
investigation
by
the
federal
power
commission.
those
of
us
who
practice
before
the
commission
day
in
and
day
out,
we
are
not
living
that
way.
we
represent
producers
and
pipelines.
i
think
would
be
almost
unanimous
in
saying
to
this
court
that
the
federal
power
commission
is
a
mighty
tough
regulator
of
rates.
