mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
searls,
where
do
we
find
the
evidence
in
the
record,
that
hearing
officer
used
to
determine
that
the
need
for
this
supply
was
greater
than
the
cost
consideration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
point
is
this,
was
there
any
comparison
based
upon
evidence
between
the
need
and
the
price
consideration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
any
of
them
finally
decided?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
goes
back
to
54?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
searls
i
was
wondering
why
in
one
of
these
later
cases
such
as
we
have
here
it
can
be
anticipated
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
would
be
made
early
this
fall,
where
on
the
other
hand
none
of
the
older
cases
have
been
decided
and
the
phillips
case,
which
was
as
far
back
as
1954,
it's
not
if
then
decided.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
all
of
these
other
earlier
ones
ready
for
decision
by
the
examiner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
searls.
