mr.
david
t.
searls
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court!
this
is
a
natural
gas
case
and
involves
a
decision
by
the
federal
power
commission
granting
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
these
four
petitioners
who
are
four
producers
of
natural
gas
authorizing
them
to
sell
their
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
to
the
tennessee
gas
transmission
company
which
is
a
long
line
extending
from
texas
and
louisiana
into
the
middle
west
and
on
into
the
atlantic
seaboard
and
in
to
new
england.
as
a
result
of
the
order
of
the
commission,
granting
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
these
four
producers,
the
new
york
state
commission
and
two
distributing
companies,
who
were
interveners
before
the
commission,
filed
a
petition
for
review
with
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
that
court
reversed
the
commission's
order
and
sent
the
case
back
and
set
aside
the
order
of
the
commission,
granting
certificates
for
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
these
four
producers
and
the
case
is
before
your
honors
on
certiorari.
these
four
producers
discovered
one
of
the
large
natural
gas
fields
and
they
found
it
out
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
about
25
or
30
miles
off
the
southwestern
shore
of
louisiana.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
it
is
the
largest
natural
gas
reserve
that's
ever
been
committed
to
interstate
commerce
in
a
single
sale.
each
of
these
four
producers
entered
into
a
separate
contract
with
a
pipeline
company
for
the
sale
of
this
gas,
but
the
contracts
are
substantially
the
same.
those
contracts
were
made
in
august
1956
in
which
they
agreed
to
sell
this
gas
in
interstate
commerce
at
a
price
commencing
at
21.4
cents
per
mcf
plus
1
cent
gathering
tax
with
a
provision
that
the
price
would
escalate
2
cents
per
mcf
each
four
years
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
in
this
contract,
it
was
provided
that
each
of
the
producers
would
file
an
application
for
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
with
the
federal
power
commission,
and
it
was
also
provided
that
if
they
did
not
obtain
satisfactory
certificates
by
april
1,
1957,
they
would
have
the
right
to
cancel
their
contract.
pursuant
to
this
contract,
applications
were
filed,
a
hearing
was
held
in
early
part
of
1957,
and
on
march
29,
1957,
the
examiner
rendered
his
decision
in
which
he
found
that
certificates
should
be
issued
to
these
four
producers.
he
stated
that
this
was
a
new
pricing
area.
this
was
a
new
productive
area
for
natural
gas
and
the
examiner
as
a
fact
that
the
payment
of
the
price
provided
for
in
these
contracts
would
not
escalate
or
trigger
any
of
the
favored
nation's
clauses
of
the
other
tennessee
gas
contracts
about
which
tennessee
had
agreed
to
purchase
gas
onshore
in
southern
louisiana.
and
that
it
would
not
disrupt
the
price
of
natural
gas
because
it
was
in
a
new
area,
in
a
new
pricing
area
where
no
gas
was
being
delivered
from
at
present
time.
he
found
that
he
should
not
go
into
the
question
of
price
and
convert
this
certificate
case
into
a
rate
hearing,
rather
that
he
should
proceed
to
grant
certificates
in
this
case
because
there
was
a
great
need
for
the
natural
gas
and
accordingly
the
certificates
should
issue
it
subject
to
review
by
the
commission.
in
a
few
weeks,
on
april
22,
the
commission
entered
its
first
order.
in
that
order
the
commission
found
that
price
was
a
very
important
matter
here.
they
also
recognized
that
this
supplier
was
very
important.
that
this
was
a
very
important
supplier
for
the
tennessee
gas
system,
an
important
supplier
for
the
consumers
who
acquired
this
gas.
but
--
so
the
commission
stated
that
it
would
issue
temporary
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
these
four
producers
and
then
it
would
send
the
case
back
to
the
presiding
examiner
to
determine
at
what
price
the
public
convenience
and
the
necessity
required
this
gas
to
be
sold.
these
four
producers
filed
their
motion
re-hearing
and
a
motion
to
modify
the
order
in
which
they
stated
that
they
could
not
take
the
economic
risk
of
accepting
temporary
certificates.
on
the
hearing,
it
had
been
proved
that
they
had
to
place
these
leases
into
production
by
1958
or
they
would
lose
their
leases.
so
they
stated
they
could
not
take
this
economic
risk,
and
they
asked
the
commission
to
reconsider
the
matter.
the
commission
did
reconsider
the
matter
and
on
may
20th
1957,
the
commission
entered
its
second
order
and
in
this
order,
the
commission
granted
permanent
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
these
four
producers,
but
in
doing
so,
it
made
these
two
findings.
the
commission
said
now
there
is
pending
before
the
congress,
the
harris
bill,
and
this
harris
bill
as
it
is
now
written
will
take
away
from
us
the
right
to
review
the
initial
price,
even
under
section
5(a)
proceeding.
and
in
view
of
that
fact,
in
other
words,
they
said
in
effect,
we
really
got
to
review
this
price
now
or
we
might
lose
the
right
to
review,
if
the
harris
bill
should
pass.
that
particular
harris
bill
had
not
passed
up
to
this
time.
they
further
found
that
price
was
a
very
important
issue
here
and
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
show
at
what
particular
price
level,
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
this
gas
to
be
sold.
after
making
those
findings,
they
then
ordered,
that
a
certificate
issue
on
the
condition
that
these
four
producers
rewrite
their
price
provision
and
the
commission
set
forth
in
the
order,
in
very
precise
language,
what
particular
language
should
be
written
into
the
price
order.
and
it
provided
that
the
price
should
be
17
cents
instead
of
21.4,
and
that
it
should
escalate
to
21.4
and
the
commission
provided
that
on
the
second
day
after
service
commenced
under
this
contract,
these
producers
could
get
their
full
price,
but
that
price
would
be
suspended
and
they
get
could
put
that
price
into
effect
under
bond
and
then
they
could
try
to
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
entitled
to
the
21.4
cents
as
a
section
40
proceeding
in
which
the
burden
rest
upon
the
producers
to
establish
their
price.
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
order
of
may
20th
and
the
particular
price
provision
which
i
am
referring
to
your
honor,
appears
on
the
second
volume
on
page
530,
where
the
commission
provides
for
the
changing
of
section
10
of
the
contract
right
at
the
bottom
of
page
530,
and
sets
out
specifically
what
this
initial
price
shall
be.
now
this
was
not
a
satisfactory
certificate
to
these
producers.
firstly
as
they
didn't
think
the
order
was
lawful,
they
did
not
think
it
was
lawful,
they
didn't
think
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
law,
but
they
did
not
file
a
motion
for
rehearing
with
respect
to
it,
but
the
pipeline
company,
the
tennessee
gas
transmission
company
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing,
in
which
the
pipeline
company
stated
that
the
producers
had
advised
it
that
they
would
not
accept
this
certificate
where
this
price
condition
as
set
forth
in
the
commission's
order
and
they
would
elect
to
terminate
their
contract.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
sir.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
commission
could
proceed
under
the
section
5(a)
once
the
price
schedule
is
--
once
the
price
is
on
file
as
a
rate
schedule,
they
could
review
it.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
sir.
and
the
commission
did
what
we
say,
the
act
does
not
give
the
commission
authority
to
do
it,
they
suspended
that
increase
of
4
and
10th
cents,
and
right
of
suspension
is
not
given
with
respect
to
an
initial
price
and
they
placed
the
burden
upon
us
to
proceed
in
a
section
4
(a)
proceeding.
now
after
the
tennessee
gas
transmission
company
filed
their
motion
for
rehearing,
setting
out
these
facts,
the
commission
granted
the
rehearing
and
issued
another
opinion.
i
do
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
in
connection
with
this
may
20th
order,
one
of
the
commissioners
has
dissented,
and
he
dissented
on
this
proposition,
that
the
matter
of
the
initial
price,
was
a
matter
to
be
agreed
upon
in
the
contract
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller,
and
that
the
consumers
could
be
amply
protected
in
a
section
5(a)
proceeding.
now
in
this
rehearing,
two
of
the
commissioners,
who
had
been
with
the
majority
on
the
may
20th
order,
switched
over
and
joined
commissioner
kline
who
had
been
on
the
dissenting
side
on
the
may
20th
order
and
so
the
three
of
them
constituted
a
majority
in
rendering
this
order
which
is
the
one
in
issue
here
of
june
24th
1957.
now
in
the
june
24th
order
1957,
this
particular
order
that
i
am
referring
to
appears
in
volume-2
of
the
record
commencing
at
page-44,
in
this
june
24th
order,
the
commission
pointed
out
that
this
was
one
of
the
great
suppliers
of
natural
gas,
that
there
was
a
need
for
the
natural
gas,
and
that
price
was
not
the
prime
determinant
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
they
went
on
to
state
that
they
were
going
to
grant,
and
they
did
get
grant,
permanent
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
these
four
producers,
but
in
doing
so,
they
pointed
this
out
in
a
opinion.
they
said
that
sections
5(a)
proceedings
and
investigations
are
already
on
file
as
to
three
of
these
four
producers
and
this
particular
price
after
it's
filed
as
a
rate
schedule
will
be
investigated
and
determined
in
these
three
sections
5(a)
proceedings
that
are
now
pending
against
three
of
these
four
producers.
and
then
the
commission
further
said
that
contemporaneously
with
the
entry
of
this
order,
we
are
instituting
a
section
5a
proceeding
against
the
fourth
producer
and
that
was
done.
and
after
saying
that
the
commission
then
said
by
this
means,
relief
can
be
afforded
to
the
consuming
public,
if
it
should
be
found
that
the
21.4
cent
initial
rate
to
be
charged
for
the
offshore
gas
is
excessive.
now
we
say
that
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
did
the
commission
have
the
discretion
to
enter
that
order
and
to
provide
that
this
matter
of
price
or
rate
could
be
determined
in
section
5a
proceedings
without
going
in
to
this
question
of
the
initial
rate
and
undertaking
to
the
determinant
in
connection
with
the
issuance
of
these
certificates,
what
the
initial
rate
should
be
and
then
placing
a
condition
in
its
order
limiting
the
rate
to
that
which
is
found
to
be
the
one
that
might
be
just
and
reasonable
or
as
the
commission
expressed
it
in
their
pervious
opinions,
a
particular
that
was
required
for
by
public
convenience
and
necessity.
now
when
the
case
was
reached
the
court
of
appeals,
they
really
never
reached
or
never
got
to
this
basic
issue
as
to
whether
the
commission
had
this
discretion
and
whether
they
properly
exercised
the
discretion
in
this
case
or
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
the
discretion
as
exercised
by
the
commission.
they
went
off
on
this
proposition.
they
said
that
when
the
producer
said
they
would
not
accept
this
may
20th
order,
which
rewrote
the
price
condition,
price
provision
and
made
it
a
condition
in
the
order,
they
thereby
circumscribed
the
inquiry
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
and
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
because
they
refused
to
accept
a
certificate
which
reduced
their
price,
under
the
terms
of
the
may
20th
order.
and
as
i
say,
the
commission
actually
never
determined
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
commission
had
the
discretion,
the
court
never
determined
that
question
where
the
commission
had
the
discretion
to
issue
the
later
order
granting
the
certificates
and
saying
this
matter
of
price
or
rate
can
be
determined
in
a
section
5
(a)
proceeding.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
don't
think
that
it
is
exactly
correct
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
they
said
that
we
had
done
that.
that
we
had
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
is
true,
but
they
said
we
have
brought
that
about.
we
had
brought
about
that
limitation
upon
the
inquiry.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
sir,
they
said,
we
had
brought
about
that
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
and
upon
--
limitation
upon
the
inquiry
of
the
commission.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
matter
sue
sponte
which
was
not
raised
by
the
parties
and
which
had
to
be
raised
by
one
of
the
statute,
by
motion
for
rehearing
as
well
as
in
the
petition
for
review,
a
point
that
none
of
the
parties
ever
conceived
off,
because
certainly,
no
party
can
limit
the
jurisdiction
or
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
of
the
federal
power
commission
or
any
other
administrative
body.
we
might
take
a
position
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
just
as
we
took
a
position
here
for
a
business
reason,
but
that
doesn't
limit
the
power,
the
jurisdiction,
or
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
of
the
commission.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
don't
interpret
the
decision
just
that
way.
i
interpret
the
decision
that
the
producers
imposed
this
upon
the
commission
and
that
the
producers
brought
this
situation
about
which
certainly
we
couldn't
bring
about.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
commission
was
free
to
reach
on
a
decision
on
what
they
pleased,
then
we
had
the
right
to
either
accept
or
reject
the
certificate
which
was
issued
to
us,
but
under
no
circumstances
could
we
limit
the
jurisdiction
to
commission.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
disabling
itself.
i
think
it
might
say
what
is
more
in
the
public
interest
to
have
this
natural
gas
committed
to
interstate
commerce
and
determine
this
rate
question
under
section
5(a)
proceeding.
mr.
david
t.
searls
whether
they
can
do
that
and
i
think
that
certainly
the
commission
can
say
weighing
to
public
interest,
we
think
that
the
important
thing
here
is
to
get
this
gas
committed
to
interstate
commerce.
here
is
that
price.
it's
the
largest
unsold
natural
gas
reserve
and
we
think
the
public
in
interstate
commerce
should
have
this
reserve.
therefore,
we
will
issue
these
certificates,
but
we
think
we
can
protect
the
public
by
proper
section
5(a)
8
proceedings
where
we
review
the
rate
schedule
which
is
on
file.
now
the
respondents
don't
undertake
to
defend
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
here.
the
commission
in
an
amicus
brief
which
they
filed,
they
want
your
honors
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
reached
an
incorrect
decision
here.
so
we
say,
if
there
is
no
one
defending
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
before
your
honors
in
this
case.
so
that
brings
us
back
to
what
we
say
is
the
real
issue
here.
did
the
commission
had
the
discretion
to
do
what
it
did
on
june
24
and
did
it
properly
exercise
that
discretion
or
was
there
an
abuse
of
that
discretion?
that
is
the
real
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
sir,
i
think
this
is
what
is
responsible
for
the
commission's
position
in
there
and
i
think
they
very
candidly
admit
it
why
they've
changed.
the
commission
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals
attacking
court
of
appeal's
decision.
but
before
the
time
came
prior
certiorari
to
this
court,
we
commenced
service,
we
started
delivering
natural
gas
and
the
commission
states
commencing
at
the
bottom
of
page
17
and
then
turning
over
to
page
18
of
that
brief,
the
amicus
brief,
hence
they
say
when
the
court
below
denied
rehearing
in
august
1958,
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
the
producers
to
abandon
their
service
to
tennessee
gas,
absent
a
finding
by
the
commission
under
section
7b.
it
followed
that
the
producer
sought
has
a
result
of
that
decision
to
begin
service,
while
the
petition
to
review
the
commission's
order
was
still
outstanding
were
no
longer
free
to
refuse
to
sell
their
gas
and
to
reject
a
permanent
certificate.
so
i
think
they're
very
candid
in
saying,
we
have
commenced
service
now.
we
can't
abandon
that
service.
so
this
gas,
without
the
consent
of
the
commission,
so
this
gas
is
committed
to
interstate
commerce.
so
the
commission
said
in
effect,
we
have
this
gas
now
committed
to
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore
we
can
go
back
now
and
re-impose
the
may
20th
order.
now
that's
the
way,
i
construe
that
brief
as
shown
in
pages
7,
17
and
18.
in
fact,
they
say,
they
think
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
requires
a
re-imposition
of
the
price
condition
of
the
may
20th
order.
mr.
david
t.
searls
how
is
that?
mr.
david
t.
searls
we
are
stuck
with
it,
now.
in
other
words
we've
commenced
service
they
say
and
now
we
question
whether
that's
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
no
i
do
not
agree
with
it.
in
other
words,
we
don't
have
a
valid
certificate.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
to
the
commission
to
ask
for
an
abandonment
of
service,
but
the
commission
takes
the
position
in
their
brief
that
once
we've
commenced
service,
we
cannot
abandon
that
service
without
their
consent
under
the
natural
gas
act.
that
brings
to,
this
gas
now
being
committed
then
they
can
impose
such
price
condition
as
they
may
elect,
but
they
admit
further
on
this
brief,
and
i
want
to
call
this
to
your
honor's
attention
that
this
price
condition
which
was
imposed
in
may
20th
order
was
actually
without
any
support
in
the
evidence
as
shown
on
page
94
of
the
commission's
brief
when
they
say
that
the
17
cent
price
which
they
impose
which
the
commission
originally
sought
to
have
the
producers
accepting
this
proceeding,
was
probably
subject
to
this
defect.
in
other
words,
it
was
conjectural
and
not
supported
by
evidence.
i'm
on
a
road
to
explain
why
the
commission
has
taken
that
position
except
that
the
candidly
admit,
we
having
commenced
service,
we
cannot
now
abandon
that
service
without
their
consent.
now
we
say
that
this,
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
has
this
discretion
which
we
say
they
have,
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
the
discretion
and
the
commission
deciding
that
the
proper
way
to
handle
this
matter
is
by
section
5(a).
but
we
further
say
that
actually
this
order
of
may
20th,
where
the
commission
undertook
to
rewrite
the
initial
price
was
contrary
to
the
law
that
the
commission
had
no
right
to
rewrite
that
price
provision.
that
was
a
matter
for
the
parties
to
agree
upon
the
initial
price
and
then
as
this
court
said
in
mobile,
in
a
section
40
proceeding,
on
a
section
5(a)
proceeding,
that
price
can
be
reviewed
in
a
proper
proceeding.
mr.
david
t.
searls
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
only
price
proposal
was
that
in
the
contract.
mr.
david
t.
searls
and
that
that
they
rejected.
there
was
no
other
price
proposal.
after
all
this
was
merely
a
price
proposal,
after
the
certificate
issues,
then
the
contract
would
be
filed
as
the
rate
schedule
and
would
be
accepted
to
being
reviewed
by
the
commission.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
say
that
the
commission
could
not
in
effect
rewrite
the
initial
price,
yes
sir
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
your
honor's
will
recall
that
on
the
motor
carrier
act,
there
is
right
to
suspend
the
initial
price
and
then
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
go
forward
and
determine
what
that
initial
rate
of
price
shall
be,
but
there
is
no
right
to
suspend
the
initially
price
under
the
natural
gas
act.
that
isn't
given
and
we
think
it's
clear
under
the
natural
gas
act
then
that
it
was
not
intended
that
commission
should
make
the
initial
price.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
i
say
they
must
do
that
or
else
they
can
turn
down
the
certificate.
certainly
they
can
deny
–
if
they
think
the
price
is
exorbitant
for
instance
–
mr.
david
t.
searls
--
certainly
they
could
turn
down
the
certificate
or
i
think
this
sort
of
a
situation
could
exist
your
honor
where
they
find
that
this
price
is
going
to
disrupt
the
price
situation
in
particular
area,
that
would
trigger
favored
nation's
clauses
then
they
could
impose
a
condition
reducing
that
price
under
those
circumstances.
they
wouldn't
be
undertaking
to
determine
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
price.
they
would
just
be
saying
now,
this
would
disrupt
the
mark.
this
would
bring
about
a
triggering
of
the
favored
nation's
clauses
in
all
of
these
contracts
and
thereby
increase
the
whole
price
level.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
source
for
that
power
is
section
7
(e)
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
is
the
certificate
provision
and
which
provides
that
they
can
attach
reasonable
conditions
in
connection
with
the
issues
of
certification.
mr.
david
t.
searls
but
when
they
undertake
to
determine
the
initial
price
since
they
have
no
right
to
suspend
that
price,
i
say
that's
not
a
reasonable
condition
because
that's
contrary
to
the
statutory
scheme
under
the
natural
gas
act.
but
i
say
it's
not
ever
necessary
for
you
to
reach
that
issue
here
because
accepting
the
may
20th
order
is
perfectly
valid,
still
the
commission
has
the
discretion
to
do
what
they
did
on
june
24th,
thank
you
sir.
mr.
littman
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
in
the
june
24th
order
which
is
under
review
here,
the
commission
expressly
found
that
supply
was
more
important
than
price
in
this
particular
situation,
and
they
used
this
language.
so
as
to
show
that
they
were
not
disregarding
price,
because
they
said
as
important
as
price
is
in
this
matter,
still
supply
is
more
important
because
this
is
the
largest
single
supply
of
natural
gas
which
is
ever
been
committed
to
interstate
commerce.
so
the
commission
said,
further
it
appears
to
us,
important
as
is
the
issue
of
price,
that
as
far
as
the
public
is
concerned,
the
precise
charge
that
is
made
initially
is
less
important
than
the
assurance
of
this
great
supply
of
gas.
mr.
david
t.
searls
not
too
(inaudible)
irrelevant
your
honor,
because
it
didn't
disregarded
as
such
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
but
because
it
was
such
a
great
supplier
of
natural
gas,
it
assured
continuity
of
supply
to
the
consumers
on
the
eastern
seaboard,
and
by
the
reason
of
obtaining
that
continuity
of
supply,
that
assurance
of
supply,
it
was
important
to
give
prime
consideration
to
supply
and
because
of
the
need
for
this
gas.
but
certainly
the
size
of
the
reserve
was
a
most
important
thing
to
the
distributing
companies,
to
the
pipeline
companies
and
to
the
consumers.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
don't
think
it
could
because
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
yes,
your
honor
and
then
we
can
say
we
think
we
can
amplificate
the
interest
of
the
consumer
by
section
5
(a)
proceedings.
mr.
david
t.
searls
we
had
no
patterns
in
other
price
contracts.
it's
true
that
in
the
may
20th
order,
they
had
adopted
the
price,
that
is
the
commission
did,
as
a
condition,
the
price
of
18
cents
per
mcf
which
were
being
paid
200
miles
for
the
east,
but
this
was
a
new
pricing
area.
they
did
not
find
that
that
18
cents
was
the
market
price
being
paid.
on
the
contrary
the
new
york
commission
recognizes
that
the
market
price
for
natural
gas
in
southern
louisiana
before
this
contract
was
ever
made
had
reached
20
cents
per
mcf
for
onshore
gas
and
i
refer
particularly
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
new
york
state
commission
brief
at
page
23,
where
the
new
york
state
commission
points
out
that
in
1953
and
early
1954,
now
this
was
before
even
the
phillip's
decision
on
june
7th,
54
by
this
court.
two
paper
pipeline
companies
as
they
called,
because
they
weren't
in
operation,
were
paying
from
17
to
21
cents
per
mcf,
the
new
york
commission
says
in
53
and
54
in
southern
louisiana
and
the
ftc
granted
certifications
without
price
limitations
or
conditions.
now
that's
three
years
before
the
contract
in
this
case.
then
they
referred
to
the
order
of
the
commission
on
may
20th,
1953
in
the
gulf
interstate
gas
company
case
which
set
a
price
in
southern
louisiana,
the
initial
price
of
20
cents
per
mcf
to
be
paid
for
gas
from
the
iraq
field.
so
there
you
have,
three
years
prior
to
the
execution
of
the
contracts
involved
in
this
case,
20
cents
being
paid
for
onshore
southern
louisiana
gas.
so
the
market
price
had
reached
that
level.
now
here
was
a
greater
prize
as
a
larger
reserve
because
the
reserves
involved
in
the
gulf
interstate
gas
and
the
iraq
field
and
also
in
the
other
fields
for
smaller
quantities
of
gas
and
also
the
record
shows
in
this
case
if
other
companies
were
paying
in
the
range
of
20
cents
per
onshore
gas.
now
here
was
gas
discovered
in
90
feet
of
water,
25-30
miles
off
the
southwestern
shore
of
louisiana,
and
in
view
of
this
evidence
and
this
record,
and
here
was
a
larger
supply
of
gas
we
think
that
the
this
price
was
inline
with
the
market
price
being
paid
onshore.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
that's
wrong.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
finding
of
the
commission
was
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
that
was
in
the
record,
your
honor.
now
as
to
the
--
there
is
no
evidence.
mr.
david
t.
searls
it
was
not
a
contestant
issue.
mr.
david
t.
searls
supply
no
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
examiner
found
that
it
was
important
to
obtain
the
supply.
he
also
found
that
he
should
not
go
into
price
and
neither
respondents
here
with
the
interveners
below
offered
no
evidence
attacking
the
price
being
paid
in
this
case.
they
offered
no
evidence
on
the
question
where
it
not,
it
was
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
the
--
when
a
application
is
filed,
i
assume
that
it's
brought
it
up,
permit
that
issue
being
made
if
they
wanted
to
offer
evidence,
on
that
scores.
mr.
david
t.
searls
but
they
offered
no
evidence.
the
only
evidence
that
was
offered,
they
did
offer
evidence
as
for
this
contract,
these
contracts
that
tennessee
had
made
in
the
west
delta
area,
but
that
price
was
already
in
evidence
and
it
is
before
your
honor,
now
as
you
know,
but
no
offer
evidence
was
made
attacking
price
involved
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
commencing
at
the
point
about
the
prices
being
paid
by
others
–-
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
prices
being
paid
by
others
commencing
at
247
(a)
of
volume
1
and
continuing
for
five
or
six
pages,
reference
has
made
prices
being
paid
by
others
and
that's
shows
what
--
how
this
price
compared
with
the
price
being
paid
by
others.
and
now
the
issue
as
to
the
need
for
the
gas
was
not
contested
by
the
interveners.
it
was
tested
by
it,
that
tennessee
had
this
expanded
system
proposed
that
this
gas
would
be
needed
for
the
expansion
and
that
issue
was
contested.
it
was
found
in
every
opinion
rendered
for
the
commission
in
this
case.
they
found
the
need
existed.
mr.
david
t.
searls
as
in
issue
as
such,
there
was
no
actual
comparison.
that
gives
a
comparison
which
is
a
conclusion,
and
which
can
be
made
from
the
record
in
the
case.
but
it
was
not
a
contested
issue
to
make
a
comparison
between
price
and
between
supply.
now
by
adopting
the
5
(a)
proceeding,
i
want
to
point
out
to
your
honor,
that
the
commission
in
this
order
that's
under
review
here,
adopted
a
plan
which
is
the
plan
that
they
have
consistently
followed
as
being
the
best
way
to
determine
the
producer
price
and
that's
5
(a),
and
why
is
that
true.
if
they
deal
with
one
price
at
a
time
under
in
a
4
(e)
case,
they
create
discrimination,
because
these
producers
sell
gas
from
many
fields,
onshore
as
well
as
offshore
louisiana,
but
in
a
5
(a)
proceeding,
they
look
to
all
the
prices
and
for
that
reason,
whenever
a
producer
of
any
size,
as
a
general
rule,
commences
a
4
(e)
case,
the
commission
comes
right
back
with
a
5
(a)
proceeding,
so
that
they
can
review
and
adjust
all
other
prices.
and
when
they
adopted
the
5
(a)
proceeding
in
this
case,
they
were
following
the
practice
that
they
considered
to
be
best
to
determine
the
producer
prices.
otherwise,
if
they
reduce
the
price
or
raise
the
price
one
at
a
time
they
would
create
a
discrimination
which
is
forbidden
in
the
act
just
as
much
as
the
act
requires
the
prices
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
now
these
proceedings
are
moving
ahead,
i
don't
agree
that
these
5
(a)
proceedings
are
a
stall
at
all.
mr.
david
t.
searls
not
finally
decided,
the
examiner's
decisions
was
rendered
a
month
ago
in
the
phillips
case
which
is
a
5
(a)
m
4
(e)
combination
case,
that
now
awaits
the
commission
decision.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
it
does
your
honor.
now
in
these
four
cases
involving
these
four
producers,
the
commission
has
completed
its
investigation
in
two
cases
that
evidence
has
been
offered,
the
witnesses
has
been
cross-examined.
and
next
month
one
of
these
producers
goes
forward
with
its
evidence,
another
producer
has
already
offered
its
evidence,
and
in
the
third
case
the
producer
already
offered
its
evidence.
three
of
these
four
producer
cases,
rate
cases,
should
be
ready
for
decision
by
the
examiner
in
the
fall.
so
these
cases
are
moving
forward.
the
commission
has
had
a
tremendous
responsibility
following
the
phillips
case
to
decide
these
producer
cases.
it
was
in
a
new
field,
it's
going
to
have
to
set
new
standards
and
has
had
many
cases,
but
it's
been
handling
the
cases
expeditiously,
the
administrative
process
has
not
broken
down
and
as
long
as
that
expertise
is
allowed
to
be
exercised
and
the
commission
is
permitted
to
go
forward
and
exercise
its
discretion,
i
am
confident
that
the
public
interest
would
be
fully
protected.
mr.
david
t.
searls
in
that
it
places
the
burden
of
proof
in
4
(e)
on
the
producer
and
5
(a)
on
the
commission.
i
don't
think
that
the
burden
is
going
forward
with
any
great
difference.
now
for
instance,
in
this
5
(a)
proceeding
involving
cities
service,
in
this
case,
which
is
one
of
the
producers
here,
it
is
a
combination
of
4
(e)
and
5
(a)
case,
because
here
is
the
case
where
the
commission,
by
the
4
(e)
case,
may
have
consolidated
4
(e)
with
5
(a).
the
producer
has
gone
forward
with
its
evidence
first,
instead
of
letting
the
commission
go
forward
first.
in
other
words
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
that's
a
matter
of
working
out
with
the
staff
or
the
commission
or
with
the
commission
as
to
who
will
go
forward
first
with
the
evidence.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
it
has
in
several
cases.
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
that
case
the
cities
service
went
forward
without
any
objection.
so
it's
just
like
in
any
lawsuit,
once
the
evidence
gets
on
the
way
it's
never
cited
as
a
general
rule
which
one
had
the
obligation
to
go
forward
first.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
since
the
burden
of
proof
in
one
case
would
rest
on
the
commission
it
might
be
considered
that
the
quantum
of
proof
would
be
great,
but
i
have
not
seen
any
case
turn
on
that
issue.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
didn't
say
the
commission
your
honor
would
reach
the
decision,
(inaudible)
i
said
it
would
be
ready
for
decision
by
the
examiner
i
believe
chief
justice.
mr.
david
t.
searls
not
necessarily
so.
now
i
think
i
could
answer
that
this
way.
the
commission
has
been
pioneering
of
course
in
these
producer
cases,
those
that
never
had
this
issue
before
it
until
after
the
decision
on
june
7th,
1954.
now
after
that
decision
they
had
to
lay
down
certain
rules
to
be
followed,
and
whatnot.
now
when
the
commission
decides
the
phillips
case,
which
is
already
been
decided
by
the
examiner
and
which
resulted
in
$9
million
annual
increase
for
phillips,
under
the
examiner's
decision
in
a
5
(a)
case,
when
that's
decided
undoubtedly
a
number
of
standards
will
be
set
which
will
expedite
the
handling
of
these
other
rate
cases.
up
to
this
point
we
have
not
had
a
decision
to
set
the
standards
in
determining
how
you
ascertain
a
just
and
reasonable
price
for
the
producers.
so
i
would
say
to
answer
your
honor's
question
as
soon
as
we
get
the
first
case
decided,
setting
those
standards
we
will
be
able
to
move
forward
much
faster.
mr.
david
t.
searls
thank
you.
