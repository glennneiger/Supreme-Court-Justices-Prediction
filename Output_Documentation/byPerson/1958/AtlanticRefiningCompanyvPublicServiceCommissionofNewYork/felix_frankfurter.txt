justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
the
decision
of
the
court,
and
you
correct
me,
was
that
the
commission
had
handicapped
itself
and
mutilated
the
range
of
inquiry
relevant
to
and
necessary
for
determining
whether
there
is
a
public
interest
and
that
–
is
that
an
unfair
way
of
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
gave
us
a
reason.
they
said
that
producers
were
influenced
by
the
fact
--
or
the
commission
felt
this
threat
that
announced
business
actions
of
the
producers,
but
i
didn't
understand
that;
that
motive
--
because
that
was
the
motive
or
the
business
reason
of
the
producers,
that
therefore
the
order
was
no
good,
that
certainly
illuminated
why
that
happened,
what
happened.
i
read
it
was
a
failure
to
consider
the
relevant
basis
on
which
a
certificated
must
be
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
didn't
want
to
take
a
certificate
except
this
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
think
that
the
speculation
--
suppose
you
said,
well,
we
are
going
to
terminate
this
option,
if
that's
what
it
was,
i
suppose
it
was,
and
gave
no
reason
at
all,
do
you
think
that
would
have
made
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
wasn't
the
criticism
of
the
producers,
this
was
a
decision
of
self-restricted
scope
of
inquiry
and
that
was
the
decision,
isn't
it
(inaudible)
whether
the
commission
can
neglect
to
consider
the
question
of
price,
at
the
moment
it
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
was
(inaudible)
body.
they
were
free
to
do
what
they
feel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
could
as
a
matter
not
as
too
distinct,
but
it
is
certainly
an
intellectually
tenable
preposition
that
an
administrative
agency
unduly
disabled
itself
from
taking
into
account
the
relevant
issue
for
its
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
real
question,
whether
they
can
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
they
did,
what
you
call
rewrite
the
price,
was
there
any
direct
proposal
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
price
proposal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
of
course
they
rejected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
was
saying,
or
did
i
not
understand
you
to
say,
that
although
there
was
this
price
proposed,
it
was
beyond
the
commission's
legal
power
to
act
upon
that
tentative
proposal
by
the
parties
in
giving
a
tentative
price
of
its
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
do
you
say
that
they
must
accept
that
and
then
subject
to
their
price,
section
5,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can
turn
it
on
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
source
for
that
power
which
you
recognized?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
initiating
a
price
tentatively
is
not
in
your
view
a
reasonable
condition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
another
way
of
implying
you
got
to
have
discreation
in
this
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
you
lie
down
there
of
services,
it
worked
out
to
be
so
(inaudible)
they
have
a
no
way
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
we
would
have
to
decide,
you
are
really
inviting
us
to
consider
with
the
okalahoma
case
which
is
on
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
otherwise,
say
they
were
lying,
yet
they
contradict
each
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
takes
there
is
a
(inaudible)
they
will
compel
to
fix
the
price,
again
with
the
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
preceding
the
determination
of
the
granting
of
certification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
then
that
was
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
just
to
indicate
that
there
might
be
differences,
the
going
rates
implies,
going
rates
for
the
same,
for
the
going
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
question
in
my
mind
for
some
time.
if
full
scale
rate
determinations
are
not
be
made,
how
shallow
or
substantial
would
be
this
preview
determination
on
a
hop,
skip
and
a
jump.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
more
on
the
hop
skip
and
jump?
justice
felix
frankfurter
test
with
that
for
us,
as
when
this
–
the
context
in
which
it
is
made
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
context
is
unread
as
to
the
applicability
of
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
got
you.
so
hearings
under
such
house,
from
how
your
experience,
how
long
those
hearings,
is
it
a
matter
of
a
few
days
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
used
to
take
(inaudible)
or
wasn't
just
to
–
they
were
unwilling,
they
were
unwilling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
it.
if
the
commission
had
insisted
on
picking
a
tentative
rate
and
they
had
to
post
that
on
the
ground,
there
was
no
basis
especially,
and
they
had
then
come
here
against
the
denial
of
a
certificate,
because
the
commission
insisted
on
condition
yet
with
the
rate
or
the
price,
and
i
think
it
would
be
quick
reaction,
early
reaction,
they
insisted,
but
this
the
commission's
doing.
now
unless
you
say
that
the
commission
coerced
by
their
correcting
your
suggestions
with
determination
of
the
contract,
then
the
question
is
whether
the
commission
of
its
own
determination
and
on
its
own
responsiveness
made
this
decision
without
a
doubt.
i
don't
think
that
it
helped
the
argument
much
that
they
were
not
satisfied
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
you
have
to
decide
this
order
at
pressure,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
then
it
would
be
--
then
it
will
be
taken
care
from
the
floor,
if
it's
as
easy
as
that
and
they
can't
maintain
this
price
under,
in
the
section
4
(b)
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
--
is
there
any
bounding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
gets
down
to,
doesn't
it
that
the
administrative
teachings
of
these
statutes
as
they're
effectually
operating,
have
turned
out
to
be
not
efficacious,
and
from
there
an
inference
is
to
be
drawn
as
to
the
restrictions
under
which
the
commission
must
apply
section
7.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
certification
provision
specifically
say
that
they
must,
in
granting
the
certificate,
make
price
protection,
does
it
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
saying
that
looking
from
literal
language
as
an
answer
to
statutory
questions,
but
you
say
so
strongly,
that
it
says
specifically,
it
doesn't
say
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
producers
weren't
going
to
accept
the
certificates
on
those
terms
which
i
take
it
they
had
the
right
to
do.
indeed
the
commission
then
said
all
right,
we
think
the
larger
public
interest
requires
that
we
handle
the
matter
as
they
handle
it
in
a
second
order.
now
what
i
am
asking
is
what
you
want
the
commission
to
do
now?
what
do
you
think
they
should
do?
they've
considered
the
thing,
highly
observed
the
thing,
but
you
say
the
only
thing
is
they
should
consider
now
what
more
can
they
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
repeat
exactly
the
words
you
said
that
it
need
not
find
what
at
the
rate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
the
contention
of
the
respondent
is
that
it
can't
issue
a
certificate
without
making
some
provision
for
rates
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
find
what
the
reasonable
rate
is,
but
it
must
make
some
what
shall
i
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
determination
of
that
would
be
and
just
and
reasonable
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
significance
of
the
rate?
is
this
an
outside
gas
or
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
perhaps
when
you
say
that,
and
well
then
you
take
the
whole
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
you
make
it
improper;
you
think
you
start
with
it
in
your
premise
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
or
are
you
saying
is
that
the
scheme
of
section
4
would
be
rendered
(inaudible)
and
would
be
frustrated,
unless
you
have
some
price
pegging
in
the
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
section
4
is
another
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
because
of
the
different
burden
approved,
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
because
the
volume
of
the
business
is
before
the
commission
involves
delay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
argument
is
that
the
actual
administrative
operation
of
the
statute
passed
by
congress
will
determine
how
you
construe
section
7,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kirby,
may
i
ask
what
justice
harlan
strikes
in
another
form,
or
another
aspect,
another
face
of
it,
would
your
case
be
any
different
if
there
had
not
been,
pardon
me
--
three
determinations
by
the
commission
but
just
one,
if
the
crutch
all
before
us
merely
gave
us
the
certificate
in
its
last
case.
would
the
case
be
any
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
legal
questions
stripped
down
as
many
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kirby,
what
you're
really
doing,
what
your
argument
does
is
to
infuse
section
4
(e)
into
7,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that's
how
they
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
why
it
isn't
just
as
reasonable,
just
as
fair,
just
as
relevant
if
you're
going
to
infuse,
why
you
don't
infuse
section
5
rather
than
section
4
(e)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
we
have
to
imply,
if
we
have
to
imply
the
protection
of
the
consumer,
why
don't
we
imply
it
from
5
just
as
well
as
from
4?
congress
has
said
nothing
in
7,
about
one
or
the
other,
and
yet
you
choose
4
instead
of
5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
that
isn't
quite
true
(inaudible)
so
you
can't
take
no
remedy
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
kirby,
the
case
is
here
in
order
to
review
whether
they
were
right,
they
are
not
foreclosed
by
what
they
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
searls,
i
am
still
an
ignorant
of
why
the
fact
that
it's
largest
supply,
is
significant,
so
as
to
render
the
determination,
tender
the
determination
of
price
irrelevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
not
defined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
also
implies
that
a
good
tentative
case,
as
to
the
to
the
proper
taking
of
the
price
could
not
have
been
made
within
the
allowable
period
or
relevant
business
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
answer
to
mr.
brown's
argument,
that
you
had
patterns
in
other
price
contracts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
a
contestant
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
issue
with
contestant?
what's
the
problem
the
balance
that
you
put
(inaudible)
found
supply
this
new
price
you
call
it,
as
against
determining
the
price
within
a
reasonable
time,
was
that
canvassed
by
the
examiner
and
was
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
any
claim
if
one
can
call
it,
before
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
the
examiner's
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
the
issues,
were
issues
are
permitted
to
make
such
offer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
offer
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
a
word,
can
you
take
a
minute
to
say
something
or
comment
on
the
argument
heavily
stressed
as
i
follow
it,
that
the
difference
between
4
(e)
and
5
(a)
is
a
very
considerable
difference
in
the
handicapping
presumption
so
far
as
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
out
of,
it's
just
something
(inaudible)
who
determined
that
it's
going
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
commission
(inaudible)
direct
that
the
producer
better
go
forward
in
one
of
these
combined
hearings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
difference
in
the
quantum
of
proof
that
you
find?
