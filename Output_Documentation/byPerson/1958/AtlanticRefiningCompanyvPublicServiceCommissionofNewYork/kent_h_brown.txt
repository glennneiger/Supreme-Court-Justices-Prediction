mr.
kent
h.

may
it
please
the
court?
in
1954,
when
this
court
determined
the
phillip's
case
and
announced
to
the
world
that
the
producer
of
natural
gas
who
sold
its
product
or
resale
interstate
commerce,
was
within
the
content
of
the
natural
gas
act,
a
natural
gas
company,
subject
to
all
of
the
provisions
thereof.
the
going
rate
for
producer
sales
in
southern
louisiana
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
10
cents.
in
the
short
space
of
time,
since
the
rendition
of
that
decision
in
1954
and
today,
we
have
leaped
in
progressive
steps
to
as
high
as
24.5
cents
per
mcf.
we
are
here
engaged
in
the
proceeding
that
gave
rise
to
the
leap
from
18
cents
to
22
cents
in
one
fell
swoop.
i
think
it
is
vital
for
this
court
to
know,
in
order
to
evaluate
the
contentions
made
both
by
the
petitioners
before
this
court
and
by
ourselves,
how
we
got
from
the
10
cents
that
we
started
out
with
in
the
1954,
also
in
one
fell
swoop
to
the
18
cent
level
from
which
we
started
with
this
case.
obviously,
we
have
been
through
all
of
these
things
once
before.
we
know
all
of
the
ramifications
of
the
contention
that
section
5
is
an
adequate
means
of
protecting
consumer's
interest
against
excessive
gas
prices.
we
know
all
of
the
consequences
that
instill
from
precipitous
increases
in
the
initial
rate,
such
as
is
here
evident.
i
will
be
very
brief
in
my
depiction
of
that
development
from
the
10
to
the
18
and
hasten
on
to
this
one.
that
league
was
initiated
by
a
sister
pipeline
company
of
tennessee,
transcontinental
gas
pipeline
corporation;
they
take
turns
in
this
regard.
in
1954
trans-co
renegotiated
a
goop
of
its
then
10
cent
contracts
and
agreed
to
pay
to
producers
17
cents,
for
the
gas
already
committed
to
their
markets.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
1954,
during
dependency
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
this
court's
decision
in
philips
and
immediately
after.
that
was
the
southern
louisiana
area,
and
constituted
almost
immediately
the
elevation
of
the
going
price
from
10
to
17
cents.
it
had
these
three
immediate
ramifications.
in
the
first
place,
the
rate
increase
filings
that
were
filed
as
a
result
of
those
renegotiated
contracts,
boosting
the
initial
--
boosting
the
rate,
charge
theretofore
from
10
to
17
cents
under
section
4,
was
the
first
section
4,
producer
proceeding
to
come
before
the
federal
power
commission
under
its
new
found,
newly
directed
authority
to
regulate
producer
affairs.
those
proceedings
prompted
--
those
filings
rather,
prompted
the
commission
to
suspend
the
17th
--
7
cent
increase
in
the
price,
for
the
maximum
period
in
most
cases,
outside
months
that
section
4
allows.
from
that
period
on,
since
1954-55,
we
have,
as
mr.
littman
just
advised,
been
paying
in
excess
of
$105
million
a
year
of
dollars
for
gas
that
is
subject
to
ftc
suspension,
and
theoretically,
ultimately,
might
be
refunded
to
us,
but
the
prospects
are
still
of
that
are
still
very
dim.
those
section
4
proceedings
that
started
in
1955
are
still
pending
before
the
federal
power
commission
unresolved.
the
explanation
lies
for
that
rise
principally,
in
the
fact
that
the
producers
adamantly
refused
to
supply
the
commission
with
any
cost
of
service
evidence
upon
the
basis
of
which
the
commission
might
possibly
arrive
at
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
those
producers.
we
had
to
come
all
the
way
through
the
first
circuit
to
this
court
in
application
for
certiorari
to
find
out
the
cost
of
service
was
material
at
all
in
the
producer
rate
case.
the
cases
were
remanded
to
the
commission,
there
they
append.
the
same
development
has
occurred
with
respect
to
section
5.
the
commission
has
instituted
several
section
5
proceedings
against
producers,
particularly
the
four
here
involved,
they
have
progressed
virtually
nowhere
to
date.
only
last
month
that
we
got
the
first
examiner's
tentative
decision
in
the
phillips
case
if
you
please,
that
was
the
case
that
gave
rise
to
the
whole
business
of
producer
regulation
in
the
first
place,
and
went
back
to
them
in
1954.
five
years
later
we
got
the
examiner's
proposed
decision.
the
commission
has
yet
to
consider
and
yet
to
rule
upon
a
single
section
4
proceeding
or
a
single
section
5
proceeding,
involving
in
a
major
producer
of
natural
gas
in
this
country.
the
point
is,
no
one
knows
yet
how,
when,
why,
where
the
commission
will
fix
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
a
natural
gas
producer.
accordingly,
the
protective
devices
built
into
those
sections
are
ostensibly
designed
to
protect
the
consumer,
have
yet
to
come
in
to
full-play
or
yes,
any
play
at
all;
with
respect
to
producer
prices,
other
than
suspension,
was
a
maximum
period
of
5
months.
the
second
ramification
of
that
boost
that
trans-co
effected
in
1954
–
mr.
kent
h.
brown
five
months
is
the
maximum
duration
of
the
period
of
suspension
of
a
rate
increase
filing
under
section
4.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
yes
sir
that
was
the
section
5
proceeding.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
there
was
not
a
rate
increased
filing
sir.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
it
was
a
section
5
investigation
by
the
commission
of
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
phillips'
entire
rate
structure,
in
which
the
burden
is
on
the
commission
to
establish
the
unjustness
and
unreasonableness,
of
the
rates,
currently
being
collected.
the
second
ramification
of
that
jump
with
trans-co
affected
in
1954
of
7
cents
was
of
course,
that
it
established
a
new
price
floor
for
bargaining
for
future
gas,
additional
gas
supplies
in
louisiana.
new
contracts
were
signed
for
new
production
at
17
cents
and
those
proceeds,
the
predecessor
of
the
one
before
us,
now,
were
the
first
to
come
before
the
commission
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
one
with
which
we
are
here
involved.
then
on
november
28,
1955,
the
commission
determined
to
permit
or
grant
an
unconditional
certification
of
a
new
purchase
contract
at
17
cents
in
southern
louisiana
in
effect
finding
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
--
in
effect
finding
that
the
producer
has
sustained
his
burden
of
proof
of
establishing
that,
imposing
no
condition,
no
limitation,
no
restraint
upon
the
collection
of
that
17
cents
and
determining,
and
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
in
the
related
section
4
proceedings,
it
has
already
made
findings
with
respect
to
this
17
cent
level,
that
they
made
the
unjust
and
unreasonable
as
a
basis
of
suspending
those,
notwithstanding
that,
unconditional
certificates
were
granted
for
the
new
purchase
contracts
on
november
28,
1955.
the
commission
saying,
we
think
we
can
adequately
protect
the
public
interest
under
section
5
proceedings,
which
may
be
instituted
at
such
time
as
they
may
be
called
for.
this
begins
to
ring
a
familiar
story.
i
--
no,
i
hope
all
time
failing
in
my
purpose.
on
the
same
day,
november
28,
1955,
which
in
our
parlance,
if
the
court
will
permit,
has
come
to
be
known
the,
which
paper
do
you
read
day,
on
the
same
day
that
the
commission
determined
to
certify
unconditionally
17
cents
in
southern
louisiana,
it
refused
to
--
certificate
unconditionally
2
cents
increase
from
10
to
12
in
southern
okalahoma,
in
almost
identical
phases
and
type
of
situation.
it
there
found
that
the
petitioner
had
not
sustained
his
burden
of
proving
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
the
12
cents
sale.
it
has
been
demonstrated
therein
that
the
2
cent
increase
would
increase
the
rate
level
in
okalahoma
generally,
to
the
detriment
of
other
purchases
of
gas
and
this
purchaser
in
that
area,
that
to
grant
the
2
cent
increase
would
disrupt
the
market
and
therefore,
and
that
further
that
section
5
proceedings,
the
recourse
they
have
brought
for
us
in
southern
louisiana,
the
section
5
proceedings
were
totally
inadequate
means
of
protecting
the
consumer
and
others
and
so
it
affected
by
a
marked
increase
in
the
field
price
of
natural
gas
such
as
the
2
cents
here
involved.
it
was
inadequate
for
the
following
reasons.
they
were
bound
to
be
long
and
protracted
and
assuming
the
culmination,
ultimately
of
the
section
5
case,
there
is
no
refund
prerogative
vested
in
the
commission
under
that
section.
any
excess
over
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
ultimately
determined,
it
may
have
been
paid
by
--
due
to
their
authorization
or
certification
of
the
2
cent
increase
here
could
not
be
refunded,
or
could
not
be
recouped.
hence
the
deleterious
effect
of
an
unconditional
certification
of
an
increase
in
price,
the
proprietary
of
which
had
not
been
fully
demonstrated.
rationalize
all
you
will,
i
respectfully
submit
two
decisions,
the
tamburello
involving
a
7
cent
increase
in
southern
louisiana
and
signal
involving
a
2
cent
increase
in
okalahoma
cannot
possibly
be
reconciled.
the
tamburello
decision
was
not
appealed
to
the
court.
had
it
been,
perhaps
we
would
not
here
be
faced
with
22
cent
gas,
or,
nor
would
we
be
faced
immediately
before
the
commission
with
25
cent
gas.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
because
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
--
if
it
was
if
–
and
a
field
had
been
taken
in
tamburello
and
had
been
established
as
we
hope
to
establish
definitively
before
this
court
that
in
the
absence
of
full
demonstration
by
the
producer
of
the
proprietary
of
their
price
increase
or
price
boost,
if
you
will,
that
the
commission
should
exercise
by
some
conceivable
(inaudible)
if
it's
going
to
certificate
the
case
at
all,
a
protective
means
of
saving
the
public
against
these
increases,
protecting
them
from
paying,
having
to
pay
them.
if
that
is
the
law
on
the
land
as
we
think
it
clearly
is,
the
likelihood
of
their
having
been
negotiated
in
bargaining
positions,
subsequent
to
the
determination
and
tamburello
of
an
ever
progressive
upwards
spark,
each
one
establishing
a
new
floor
for
bargaining
would
not
have
occurred,
because
the
industry
would
have
well
known,
that
is
either
had
to
fully
establish
the
proprietary
of
the
price
when
it
came
in
or
it
was
going
to
be
to
be
limited
on
a
conditional
–
so
to
a
conditional
certificate
at
a
level
which
would
not
disrupt
the
market
and
permit
of
such
an
spiraling
increase
in
the
initial
price
of
the
product.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
at
that
juncture
in
the
federal
power
commission's
development
or
endeavors
to
develop
the
procedures
regulating
the
producers,
we
as
one
of
the
potential
participants
that
might
have
taken
it,
resolved
not
to,
but
rather
to
repose
upon
their
assurance,
that
they
would
evolve
protective
procedures
under
the
section
4
and
section
5
processes
available
to
them,
to
prevent
of
ever
increasing
spark
prices
products
that
develops,
that
way
we
repose
too
much
confidence.
that
is
the
real
explanation
for
our
not
having
taken
tamburello
up
at
that
time.
signal
on
–
mr.
kent
h.
brown
not
necessarily
your
honor!
we
were
willing
to
assist
the
commission
in
everyway
possible
at
that
juncture
in
evolving
the
procedures
for
the
sizeable
task
that
it
had
inherited
at
the
decision
made
by
phillips.
we
were
not
pursuing
our
every
right
and
remedy
to
fullest
extent.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
the
discretion
was
ours
as
that
we
exercise,
that
we
exercise
it
not
to
take
the
matter
up
at
that
time.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
oh,
they
have
a
wide
variety,
and
a
wide
range
of
maneuvering
gone.
our
only
insistence
at
this
juncture
is
it
that
they
exercise
one
or
another
outcome
effectively,
to
prevent
this
ever
repeating,
squishing
operation
by
which
we
have
gone
from
10
to
25
cents
in
southern
louisiana
is
say
for
less
than
four
years.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
not
exactly
your
honor,
no
sir.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
we
are
taking
--
we
took
a
position
before
the
lower
court
and
are
taking
it
here
very
much
like
if
not
on
all
force
with
the
decisions
in
other
commission
and
other
courts
for
sustaining
it
in
the
signal
case.
it
is
our
position
before
this
court;
the
signal
epitomizes
the
heart
really
of
our
contention
here.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
no.
they
felt
so
impelled,
because
the
producer
had
not
sustained
the
burden
of
proof,
to
sustain
the
boosting
of
the
price
that
was
in
oklahoma
from
10
cents
to
12
cents
and
the
court
sustained
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
that's
substantially
correct
your
honor.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
if
the
producer
in
an
application
under
section
7,
before
the
commission,
accompanies
his
proof
with
some
demonstration
of
the
proprietary
of
the
price
requested,
and
if
that
price
is
not
of
a
size
or
quantity
that
will
disrupt
the
market
involved,
there
is
demonstration
i
would
say
and
the
commission
would
be
added
promptly
to
stand
in
the
determination
of
granting
an
unconditional
certificate,
assuming
all
other
proof
were,
requisite
proof
were
available.
if
however,
there
is
no
proof
or
inadequate
proof
of
the
proprietary
and
in
this
we
insist
the
producer
has
the
burden
of
proof,
he
is
the
applicant
for
a
new
certificate.
the
law
prohibits
his
sale
in
interstate
commerce
unless
he
possesses
the
certificate.
if
he
puts
in
no
proof
pertaining
to
his
new
high
price
and
that
it
is
demonstrated
on
the
record
or
from
information
contained
in
the
commission
files
that
this
is
going
to
establish
a
new
higher
rate,
a
new
high
level
in
the
area
involved,
then
we
believe
that
under
the
law,
the
only
way
the
commission
may
certificate
that
sale
is
by
exercising
one
of
the
multitudes
of
means
available
to
it,
limiting
the
certificate
or
conditioning
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
not
have
that
deleterious
effect
upon
the
public
interest,
and
thus
permit
the
sale
to
go
through
on
that
basis.
but
if
it
does
not
elect
to
exercise
those
varieties
that
are
available
to
it,
or
put
in
another
way,
its
duty
to
keep
the
price
level
that's
within
a
range
of
reasonable,
then
we
insist
it
must
pursue
the
only
alternative
left
in
the
law,
the
one
specifically
directed,
in
fact,
namely
deny
the
application.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
that
was
substantially
the
position
that
petitioners
here
would
have
you
believe
evolved
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
if
they're
so
faced,
we
do
not
believe
that
that
alters
in
the
slightest,
the
commission's
obligations
prescribed
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
fact
that
--
in
fact,
under
the
natural
gas
act,
it
has
no
authority;
it
hasn't
indicated
to
compel
anyone
to
devote
anything,
any
gas
reserve
to
the
interstate
market.
it
is
not
vested.
it
is
not
charged
with
the
responsibilities
under
the
act
of
seeing
to
it
that
people
do
so.
it
might
be
conceded
that
it
has
–
assumed
to
have
an
obligation
of
providing
or
seeking
through
conduct
itself
in
a
manner
that
it
will
in
all
likelihood
assure
reasonable
supplies
of
gas,
at
reasonable
quantities,
at
reasonable
prices,
but
it
isn't
in
a
position
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
or
someone
other
similar
agency.
its
primary
interest
in
other
words
is
not
to
ensure
the
devotion
of
gas
to
interstate
commerce.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
statute
reads
quite
in
the
negative
of
that.
its
obligation
is
to
prohibit
the
introduction
of
gas
into
interstate
commerce,
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
proof
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
including
if
you
--
this
court
so
holds
and
i
hope
it
will
deny
their
price.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
i
think
the
act
in
neglecting
to
provide
any
means
is
devoting
gas
or
having
commission
command
gas,
if
you
will,
obviously,
relied
upon
an
economic
incentive
to
produce
for
the
interstate
market
adequate
supplies
from
the
producers.
it
has
been
more
than
an
inadequate
incentive.
we
are
faced
with
no
problems
along
that
score
as
far
as
products
are
doing
more
here
of
course.
it
is
unlikely
that
that
incentive
will
fail.
as
has
been
demonstrated
this
morning
that
there
is
an
intrastate
market
that
they
can
bargain
against
to
the
intrastate
market
too,
but
there
was
no
proof
in
this
case,
for
instance,
of
any
potential
intrastate
market
for
this
gas.
we
were
dealing
here
with
the
two
trillion
feet
of
a
natural
gas,
in
which
--
at
which
--
at
18
cents
the
price
that
was
going
level
in
louisiana
at
that
time,
produced
360
millions
of
dollars.
there
were
millions
upon
million
of
dollars
invested
in
the
platform
to
produce
it,
returning
no
--
and
nothing
--
no
return
on
reinvestment.
the
inspiration
for
the
delivery
at
17
cents
we
think
was
there
and
in
any
event
the
commission
never
gave
an
opportunity
to
anyone
that
down
the
(inaudible)
there
was
not.
the
threats
made
a
withholding
were
we
believe
not
substantial,
and
yet
they
were
accepted
by
the
commission
as
potential,
and
it
was
persuaded
on
the
basis
there
off
to
junk
the
most
important
obligation
it
has,
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act,
namely
the
price
protection
in
favor
of
a
self
appointed
position
of
chamber
of
commerce,
get
all
the
gas
to
(inaudible)
to
be
interstate
market.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
in
the
west
delta
area
tennessee
had
purchased
17,
18
cent
depending
on
whether
you
include
the
tax
reimbursement,
gas
for
our
gulf
production,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
endeavored
before
the
commission
that
introduced
those
contracts
into
evidence
as
a
basis
of
comparison,
just
to
establish
the
fact
that
there
was
a
17
cent
level,
the
highest
known
in
southern
louisiana
and
for
tennessee
(inaudible)
gulf
for
those
gas
that
we
were
denied
the
opportunity.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
in
the
gulf,
yeah,
and
it
is
called
the
west
delta
area.
now,
if
there
is
a
distinction
and
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
we
didn't
get
to
the
point
of
finding
out
whether
there
were
kept
comparable
exactly
or
not.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
there
are
potentially
all
kinds
of
possibilities,
quite
like
reasonable
that
appear
to
me
that
the
gas
here
involved
is
more
expensive
to
acquire,
than
gas
under
our
land,
it's
not
an
unreasonable
assumption,
if
you're
going
out
in
the
middle
of
delta
to
get
it.
there's
absolutely
no
demonstration
however,
of
any
cost
of
either
one
and
it
produces
adamantly
and
vehemently
refused
the
permits
of
the
fbc
consideration
of
any
such
aspect
of
their
cases.
having
gone
from
10
cents,
which
never
incidentally
has
been
determined
to
be
just
and
reasonable
for
a
major
producer,
the
18
cents
and
now
the
22
cents,
and
just
on
the
assumption
that
this
maybe
required
by
i
think
to
increase
cost,
we
think
is
egregious
dereliction
of
duty.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
in
the
matters
of
this
kind
in
a
full
fledged
rig
case
on
either
under
section
4
or
section
5
of
matters
of
cost,
these
are
--
these
get
terrifically
involved.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
oh,
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
no
minimum
demonstration
as
to
cost
is
required
generally
or
would
reasonably
be
anticipated
in
a
section
7
case,
unless
the
price
were
above
the
higher
of
the
going
rate
for
the
area,
and
the
producer
was
desirous
of
establishing
the
proprietary
of
his
going
that
much
higher
to
get
a
full
unconditioned
certificate.
if
he
wished
to
discharge
his
burden
of
so
elevating
the
price,
in
his
case,
by
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
it
cost
him
x
dollars
more
to
get
it
then
it
did
the
18
cent
gas
for
instance,
that
would
be
his
privilege
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
there
will
be
differences
in
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
producer
against
other
producers,
certainly
that's
true.
ultimately
all
of
them
will
be
subjected
to
produce
just
and
reasonable
rate
determinations
and
probably
no
two
of
them
have
the
same
average
price,
cost
of
service
price
determination.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
we
don't
urge
that
there
be
hop,
skip
and
a
jump
approach
for
determination.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
no
particular
an
inquiry
at
all,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
unless,
if
that
prices
within
the
going
range
that
you
can
reasonably
anticipate
a
sale
to
be
made
at
any
given
time
and
any
given
field
and
this
is
demonstrable,
this
is
the
so
called
fair
field
price,
about
which
we've
heard
endless
remarks
in
this
section
4
and
section
5
cases,
the
producer
who's
had
that
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
not
to
determination
of
the
fair
field
price,
those
are
demonstrable
from
the
contracts
on
file
with
the
commission.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
the
context
is
where
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
producers
under
the
natural
gas
act
can
be
determined
solely
on
the
basis
of
these
unregulated
fair
field
prices
or
whether
we
must
start
with
some
cost
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
months.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
with
long
postponements
for
interruptions,
philip
for
instance
is,
as
i
indicated,
went
on
for
years.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
quite
satisfied
your
honor.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
you
want
an
order
that
will
in
some
way
–
mr.
kent
h.
brown
--
prevent
our
having
to
pay
an
excess
--
grievously
excessive
price,
without
any
demonstration
at
all?
mr.
kent
h.
brown
either
that
they
accept
a
certificate?
mr.
kent
h.
brown
you
might
say
that
we
would
accept
and
we
did
accept,
although
quite
startled
by
the
second
order,
the
may
20
order
that
said
we
will
grant
you
a
certificate,
if
you
will
condition
your
price
to
start
at
the
going
rate
of
the
area
and
assume
the
obligation
of
demonstrating
this
justness
and
reasonableness
and
above
that
in
a
section
4
case.
we
were
willing
to
accept
that
and
quite
willing
to
abide
by,
even
though
the
commission
therein
said
and
we
will
promise
you
that
we
won't
suspend
that
increased
rate
filing
from
18-22
more
than
24
hours,
so
that
you
can
collect
the
full
22
cents
for
as
long
as
it
takes
you
to
demonstrate
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
this
rate.
and
failing
which,
you
will
only
have
to
refund
the
difference
between
the
22
and
the
18
cent
base
on
which
we
start.
now,
the
only
one
that
could
lose
under
a
situation
like
that
would
be
the
consumer,
he
could
lose,
because
there
is
yet
to
be
a
demonstration
or
a
decision
on
just
and
reasonable
rate
anywhere
near
18
cents.
the
highest
one
yet
known,
and
there
are
only
a
few
involving
small
producers
too
in
different
areas,
the
highest
one
yet
known
is
$12.25
cents.
so,
that
our
willingness
to
accept
the
18
beyond
any
recourse
of
refund,
i
think
demonstrated
some
disposition
on
our
part
to
adjust
all
interests
in
the
proceeding,
the
consumers,
and
as
well
as
the
producers.
but
no,
they
weren't
content
with
that.
they
had
to
have
it
all
or
nothing
and
under
arrangements
whereby
they
would
be
under
no
obligation,
whatever,
to
prove
anything,
that
if
there
were
to
be
any
recourse,
this
commission
must
assume
the
full
responsibility
of
proving
them
unjust
and
unreasonable
in
a
section
5
case
the
nature
of
which
no
one
yet
understands.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
the
applicant,
producer
applicants.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
there
is
no
denying
the
last
remark
your
honor.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
it
was
they
in
the
sense
that
i
used
it
who
brought
the
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
commission
doing
three
separate
decisions
in
which
they
refused
to
accept
the
first
order
then
refuse
to
accept
the
second.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
no
sir,
no
sir!
in
other
words,
the
commission
adjusted
itself
downward
progressively
on
the
protection
of
the
pubic
interest
in
three
consecutive
steps,
winding
up
with
a
zero;
that
is
our
position.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
nothing
in
particular,
so
sir.
they
could
have
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
have
so
called
fanning
hearings
for
these,
abbreviated
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
--
that's
right,
under
section
7.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
yes
sir.
to
prove,
to
bearing
the
burden
of
proof
was
establishing
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
perhaps
by
pointing
out
that
he
was
getting
18
cents
on
land
at
cost
which
gave
him
6%
return
and
he
would
not
get
a
6%
return
going
out
in
to
the
gulf,
and
therefore
needed
the
22
cents.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
indeed
yes,
indeed
yes.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
but
that
is
his
obligation,
if
he
wants
to
affect
an
increase
in
the
going
price
range
of
the
area,
we
think
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
necessity
for
the
commission
to
permit
it.
that
is
the
whole
regulatory
purpose
involving
rates
in
the
natural
gas.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
turning
point,
if
you
will,
is
not
the
highest
price
paid
by
the
purchaser
pipeline
involved.
it
so
happens
in
this
case
that
the
18
cents
was
in
fact
the
highest
price
paid
by
tennessee,
but
point
and
the
purposefulness
of
this
second
order's
condition
of
an
initial
price
of
18
cents
was
not
that
factor.
it
was
the
factor
that
18
cents
was
the
going
price
for
the
area.
one,
an
additional
sale
and
rich
would
not
be
disrupted,
would
not
send
things
sky
high,
so
that
the
next
purchaser
going
into
the
area
would
not
be
confronted
with
a
22
cent
floor
before
he
can
even
start
to
bargain,
as
is
the
situation
today.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
it's
a
new
field
in
the
sense
that
it's
out
in
the
gulf
offshore,
southern
louisiana,
but
within
a
matter
of
hours,
days,
after
the
price
was
negotiated
and
in
subsequent
cases
before
the
commission
as
is
demonstrated
time
and
time
and
time
again,
that
price
washed
right
up
on
shore
and
became
the
going
negotiating
floor
for
all
of
southern
louisiana,
therefore,
we
say
the
area,
namely
southern
louisiana.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
if
we
had
to
demonstrate
that
a
section
4
case
was
a
feasible
remedy
and
could
be
carried
on
expeditiously
and
determined
expeditiously,
we
wouldn't
have
to
have
these,
as
you
say
manipulative
things
in
trying
to
protect
the
consumer
interest
in
the
section
7
case,
but
we
do
not
have
it.
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
rate
provisions
of
the
act
to
date
at
least,
meaningless
as
producer
price
or
preventives
against
producer
price
rampages.
they
have
yet
to
be
demonstrated
they
have
any
import,
as
far
as
protected
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
they
are
bounded,
yes,
but
as
has
been
mentioned
we
pay
$105
million
a
year
under
bond,
theoretically
sometime
we'll
get
it
back.
we
pay
an
awful
lot
more
than
that
that
is
not
under
bond;
that
has
not
been
suspended
by
the
commission
that
we
will
never
get
back.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
those
strictures
must
be
drawn.
we
think
it's
the
rare
reason,
more
fundamental
however,
built
right
into
section
7
by
congress
itself
in
the
means
of
--
method
by
which
they
directed
that
statute.
the
conditioning
clause
was
added
in
1942
specifically
if
you
please,
to
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
limit
price,
rate;
excesses
at
the
very
outset
of
the
dedication
of
gas
or
gas
products.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
it
does
in
so
many
words.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
i
said
the
congress
enacted
the
conditioning
authority
specifically
as
derived
from
its
legislative
history,
as
can
be
demonstrated
in
its
legislative
history.
it
is
our
principle
contention
here
that
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
federal
power
commission,
not
only
abused
a
privilege
of
considering
price
in
a
section
7
certificate
application,
which
is
what
the
court
below
held,
did
so
at
the
instigation
of
catco,
but
rather
that
it
was
in
dereliction
of
an
absolute
duty
imposed
upon
it
by
the
law
to
make
price
the
prime
determinant
always,
in
section
7
applications.
of
the
abuse
of
the
privilege
by
catco
we
complained
bitterly
before
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
court
below.
it
is
not
a
new
objection.
it
was
not
a
resurrection
of
the
court
below
under
a
sua
sponte
motive.
of
the
dereliction
f
duty,
we
--
contention,
we
have
made
that
contention
in
every
major
section
7
rate
case
before
the
commission
in
the
last
five
years.
there
is
nothing
sua
sponte
on
that
either.
we
respectfully
urge
therefore
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
not
only
abundantly
correct,
but
we
urge
further
that
this
court
sustain
it
under
the
broad
construction
of
section
7
as
requiring
the
commission
to
do
what
it
–
mr.
kent
h.
brown
what
it
bargained
itself
out
of
doing
in
the
third
order,
namely,
junking
the
aspect
of
price
in
consideration
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
applications
under
section
7.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
it
gave
due
full
considerations
and
reacted
responsibly
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
--
and
in
second
as
well.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
it
is
conceivable
that
there
might
be
such
a
screaming
need
for
gas
under
certain
circumstances,
not
here
present
that
they
could
jump
price
and
not
pay
attention
to
and
not
be
determined
principally
by
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
but
they
cannot
--
we
do
not
believe,
bargain
price
away
under
the
guise
of
need
for
expansion
of
gas
facilities.
the
whole
purpose
of
regulation
presupposes
need
for
the
regulated
commodity
and
a
necessity
for
the
exercise
of
price
regulatory
provisions.
you
do
not
bargain
the
two
together
and
weigh
one
against
the
other,
and
junk
one
or
the
other,
as
you
elect,
you
must
reconcile
them
both,
that
we
think
the
commission
failed
to
do
in
this
third
order.
thank
you
very
much.
