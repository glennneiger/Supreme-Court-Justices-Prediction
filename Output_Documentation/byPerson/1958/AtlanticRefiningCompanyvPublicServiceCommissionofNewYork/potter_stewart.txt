mr.
brown,
in
answer
to
question
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
brennan
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
your
answer
--
that
i
understand
your
answers
and
your
position.
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
if
the
contract
rate
had
been
equal
to
or
less
than
a
prevailing
rate
which
this
pipeline
company
was
buying
gas,
it's
your
position
that
the
commission
was
under
no
obligation
at
all
--
to
make
any
investigation
at
all
on
price?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
talking
about
this
section
7.
justice
potter
stewart
if
on
other
hand
the
contract
rate
had
it
exceeded
the
going
rate
at
which
this
particular
pipeline
was
buying
gas,
or
had
exceeded
the
maximum
rate,
current
rate,
then
it's
your
position
that
the
--
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
applicant
to
justify
that
rate,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
by
what
kind
of
proof
and
how
through
as
compared
to
a
section
5
proceeding
for
instance?
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
be
kind
of
rather
a
complicated
procedure
--
justice
potter
stewart
having
to
justify
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
follow,
would
it
not
in
your
position
that
the
--
very
much
of
the
interest
of
the
producers
to
find
a
pipeline
company
which
was
paying
the
highest
rate
currently,
because
it
could
then
establish
contract
rate,
that
has
within
the
highest
rate
and
there
would
be
no
duty
upon
the
commission
to
make
investigation
and
no
burden
upon
the
applicant
to
make
any
justifications
at
all.
