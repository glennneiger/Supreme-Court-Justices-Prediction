mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl

there's
no
question
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
question
of
any
collusion
here
between
the
employee,
employer
and
--
and
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll,
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grimm.
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
the
--
with
the
embezzlement
charges
in
puerto
rico,
the
same
transactions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
inquires
acquittal,
because
it's
from
a
trust
fund
and
not
the
union.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
grimm,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
this.
he
accomplished
this
fraud
by
means
of
one
kind
of
forgery,
let
me
give
you
another
kind
of
forgery
and
see
if
it
--
you
would
still
be
under
this
act.
suppose,
he
took
this
check
and
deposited
it
in
the
proper
fund,
the
fund
that
should
have
been
deposited
in
and
immediately
drew
a
check,
signed
it
himself
and
forging
the
signature
of
the
second
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
having
--
having
the
intention
all
the
time
to
do.
this
would
be
--
as
we
did
here.
would
he
still
be
under
this
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
what
i'm
asking
is
not
whether
he
committed
those
crimes,
its
forces
committed
crimes
but
as
he
commit
the
crime
under
this
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
point
--
go
a
little
farther.
and
suppose
at
the
time
that
he
got
the
check,
he
got
it
with
his
design
--
his
purpose
in
mind
and
then
he
immediately
forged
one
check
and
then
a
month
later,
he
forged
another
and
two
months
later,
he
forged
another.
and
he
did
it
throughout
--
throughout
the
year.
would
--
would
all
of
those
forgeries
be
elements
of
this
crime,
what
do
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
asked
them
to
give
it
to
him
instead
of
somebody
else.
he
got
it
for
that
purpose
we'll
assume.
and
--
but
he
--
he
took
the
money
out
of
the
fund
from
time
to
time,
throughout
the
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
suppose
the
only
reason
he
got
it
out
of
the
funds
would
be
because
he
--
he
forged
the
checks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

person
control
of
--
of
that
fund
because
there
were
three
of
them
that
did.he
was
one
of
only
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
--
it
only
took
him
to
get
it
out
of
this
plot?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he's
not
only
put
the
money
in
the
fund
and
then
withdrew
it
by
his
own
signature
and
a
forged
signature,
but
he
also
forged
some
other
documents
to
indicate
that
it
was
for
the
legitimate
welfare
fund
expenditure,
would
you
still
say
that
it
was
under
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
seeking
when
we
had
that
intent
at
the
time
he
took
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
just
once
more
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
then
i
hope
i
won't
have
troubled
you
again,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this.
when
the
employer
made
--
tendered
this
check
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
petitioner,
did
it
satisfy
its
legal
obligation
so
far
as
payment
to
that
fund
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
did
it
have
a
right
to
pay
through
those
channels
and
by
giving
this
check
to
the
petitioner,
did
it
legally
satisfy
its
obligation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
leave
out
the
word,
“technical.”
was
it
--
was
it
a
lawful
way
for
them
to
--
to
pay
their
obligation
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
that
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
if
anybody
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
anybody
misappropriates
and
after
that,
who
are
they
misappropriating
it
from,
the
employer
or
from
the
recipient
of
the
amount?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grimm,
suppose
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
this
man
had
a
secret
intent
not
to
put
it
into
that
trust
fund
or
welfare
fund,
but
he
intended
to
use
it
for
what
would
be
legitimate
purposes
of
the
union
and
he
put
it
into
--
to
a
union
account,
in
an
account
such
as
this
and
dispensed
it,
for
strictly
legitimate
union
purposes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
the
money
--
if
the
money
was
there's.
we'll
be
under
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
money
--
but
i'm
talking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
this
act,
that
in
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
embezzlement
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
matter
some
other
--
some
other
crime,
but
to
become
under
this
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grimm,
what
--
when
--
when
he
did
what
he
did
in
this
case,
did
he
commit
any
other
federal
crime
than
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
have
--
you
have
some.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
three
minutes,
i
think,
about
three
minutes
and
you
may
have
a
couple
of
more,
if
you
wish,
you
may
take
five
minutes
to
sum
up
your
argument.
