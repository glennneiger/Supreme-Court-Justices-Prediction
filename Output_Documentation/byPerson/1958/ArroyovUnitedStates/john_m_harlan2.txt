justice
john
m.
harlan
in
your
argument
(inaudible)
what
you're
saying,
in
fact,
i
understand
it,
you
cannot
reach
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
if
you
had
received
by
a
trust
fund,
and
certainly
under
the
theory
on
(inaudible)
cases
under
the
jury,
the
element
of
intent
(inaudible)
determine
whether
at
the
moment
you
receive
this
money
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
only
a
trust
fund.
now,
in
theory
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
in
that
case
because
the
statute
doesn't
say
receive
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
the
exception,
however,
does
not
have
(inaudible)
language.
therefore,
i
suppose
you
(inaudible)
since
the
exception
requires
only
that
the
payments
(inaudible)
there's
no
dispute
here
that
the
payment
was
in
good
faith
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
supposing
under
paragraph
(a)
required
giving
christmas
presents
to
the
head
of
the
union,
is
that
(inaudible)
to
be
indicted
for
that
under
(a)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
a
bribery
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
the
presents
got
no
element
of
bribery,
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
good
faith.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
supposing
he
had
taken
the
checks
the
same
day
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
forged
the
endorsements,
stuck
it
into
his
property,
cashed
it
and
stuck
it
into
his
account
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
would
your
case
be
different
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
under
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
that's
a
(inaudible)
you
raised
on.
i
don't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
you
argue
all
this
other
stuff.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
intendment
would
be
an
important
factor
because
you
turn
to
answer
justice
douglas
is
that
employer
pay
money
ostensibly
to
a
trust
fund
but
knowing
that
it
was
a
phony
trust
fund,
the
courts
here
would
be
not
within
the
exception
under
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
so
far
as
the
employer
--
and
there
was
a
time
he
paid
it,
that
was
to
be
the
situation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
you
don't
question
the
good
faith
of
the
employer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it's
applying
to
this
section?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
take
two
seconds
to
--
i
realize
your
time
is
being
burned
up
here.
two
seconds
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
bothers
me
that
i
raised
with
mr.
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
your
adversary.
you
understand
my
problem,
i
hope.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
drew
that
section
(c)
is
satisfied
once
the
employer
makes
a
payment
as
you've
said
he
did
make
that
satisfied
the
conditions
to
the
welfare
fund,
irrespective
of
what
the
recipient,
the
union
officer
who
did,
may
have
been
invited.
justice
john
m.
harlan
literally
read
that
it
seems
--
what
seemed
to
me
they've
satisfied
the
exception.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
that
the
employer
--
the
exception
relates
only
to
the
act
of
the
employer
treating
paid
as
meaning
the
employer
who
is
required
to
make
a
payment.
