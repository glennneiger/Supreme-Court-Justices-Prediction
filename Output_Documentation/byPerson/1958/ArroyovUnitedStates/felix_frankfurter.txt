may

ask,
what
is
the
(inaudible)
justice

frankfurter
before
you
go
on,
may
i
clarify
this,
in
my
own,
haven't
clarified
this
in
my
own
mind.
his
welfare
fund,
although
i
(inaudible)
this
welfare
fund
shall
be
administered
by
a
committee,
will
be
appointed
by
mutual
agreements
usually
with
the
employer,
what
does
that

a
what
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
fund
satisfies
a
welfare
fund
so
far
as
the
administration
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
it
can't
satisfy
the
statute,
unless
it
satisfies
the
welfare
agreement
can't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did
satisfy
the
welfare
agreement.
did
the
--
did
the
fund,
into
which
he
paid
the
check,
satisfy
the
virtues
of
the
welfare
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
a
private
agreement
that
that
could
be
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
there
--
what
about
this
old
testimony
that
he
--
he
would
be
the
sole
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
were
then
--
in
your
answer
to
this
that
while
there
was
a
committee,
while
there
was
a
provision
for
a
committee,
in
fact
the
fund
which
this
money
--
into
which
this
money,
this
check
was
paid
was
a
different
fund
outside
the
scope
of
the
welfare
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

the
scope
of
the
welfare
agreement
you
argued
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
defense
of
provided
(a).
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
reading
this
statute
as
making
--
as
satisfying
the
statute,
if
the
government
proves
that
an
employee
of
the
employer
receives
money,
suppose
you
proved
that
and
do
no
more,
would
that
--
the
government's
work
and
the
government
rest
in
or
as
the
case
is
made.
in
other
words,
my
question
is,
is
the
provider
of
(c)
an
affirmative
defense
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
approve
to
which
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant?

what
are
the

done
in
this
case,
