suppose
the

would
be

if
he
was
in
cahoots,
paid

the

justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
one
way
of
reading
the
--
the
trust

exception
is
that
it
means
something
different
from
what
mr.
hally
said
that
all
trust
fund
transactions
are
exempt.
whether
good
faith
or
bad
faith,
whether
employer

justice
william

douglas
--
had
bribed
through
a
trust
fund
or
whether
the
employee
tends
to
get
money
unlawfully
from
the
trust
fund

all
that
so

not
covered
by

that
goes
further
than
the

went

you
told
that
all

that
all
transactions
in
and
by,
and
through
trust
funds,
are
exempt,
that's
one
way
of
reading
the
act.
justice

no,
no.
i'm
--
i'm
--
this
is
another
way
of
reading
it.
you
--
neither
--
neither
party
has
suggested
it,
but
i'm
suggesting
that's
the
possible
way
of
reading
the
exemption.
