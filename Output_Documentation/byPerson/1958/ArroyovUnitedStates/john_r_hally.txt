may
it
please
the

mr.
john
r.
hally
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
the
intended
scope
of
section
302
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
defendant
was
indicted
and
convicted
in
the
district
court
of
puerto
rico
after
a
jury
trial
for
violation
of
subsection
(b)
of
that
act
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
he
contends
in
this
court
in
which
he
is
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
as
he
has
throughout.
his
conduct,
which
there
was
evidence,
did
not
constitute
an
offense
within
section
302
because
the
structure
of
the
act
is
of
some
significance
to
the
resolution
of
the
question,
i
will
comment
on
it
briefly.
subsections
(a)
and
(b),
respectively,
make
it
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
pay
to
a
union
representative
money
and
for
a
union
representative
to
receive
money
from
the
employer.
subsection
(c)
in
form
halves
out
exceptions
to
the
foregoing
flat
prohibitions.
the
most
important
ones
of
which
are
the
payment
of
the
dues
of
union
members
deducted
by
the
employer
pursuant
to
duly
authorized
check
off
and
the
one
involved
in
this
case,
payment
by
the
employer
to
a
trust
fund
established
by
the
union
for
the
payment
of
welfare
benefits
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
subsection
(d)
of
the
act
makes
the
willful
violation
of
the
section
a
misdemeanor,
and
subsection
(e)
of
the
act
gives
to
the
federal
district
courts
equity
jurisdiction
without
regard
to
the
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
restrain
violations
of
the
section.
the
defendant
was
indicted
in
1955
for
a
violation
of
subsection
(d)
in
that
he
received
$15,000
from
two
employers
on
february
24th,
1953.
at
that
time,
he
was
the
president
of
a
puerto
rican
local
of
the
international
longshoremen's
association
which
represented
units
of
employees
of
two
puerto
rican
sugar
processing
concerns.
in
february
of
that
year,
the
defendant,
on
behalf
of
his
local,
had
negotiated
with
the
employers
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
the
ensuing
three
years.
the
government's
--
that
agreement
contained
an
expressed
provision
for
the
establishment
of
a
welfare
fund
to
be
administered
jointly
by
the
employer
and
the
union.
the
government's
evidence
was
that
at
the
signing
of
the
agreement,
the
defendant
requested
that
the
employer's
two
checks
to
be
their
contribution
to
the
fund
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
agreement
in
the
amount
of
$7500
each
to
be
delivered
to
him
in
order
that
he
might
exhibit
them
to
the
union
members
at
a
meeting
that
night.
these
checks
were
made
payable
to
the
union
not
to
the
defendant
and
each
had
attached
to
it
a
voucher
expressly
stating
that
it
constituted
the
employer's
contribution
to
the
union
welfare
fund
established
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
signed
that
day.
this
was
february
21st.
on
february
24th,
the
defendant
deposited
the
checks
endorsed
by
the
secretary
of
the
local
and
by
himself
in
a
puerto
rican
bank.
the
account
was
expressly
in
the
name
of
the
pension
fund
or
whether
the
welfare
fund
of
the
union.
it
appeared
that
the
single
prior
fund
established
in
this
industry
that
is
between
this
employer
and
this
union
had
been
deposited
in
a
different
puerto
rican
bank,
but
it
did
not
appear
that
in
any
other
respects,
the
establishment
of
the
fund
by
deposit
differed
from
the
prior
practice.
this
was
february
24th.
on
march
2nd,
the
defendant
presented
to
that
bank
a
resolution
signed
by
officers
of
the
local
authorizing
him
to
withdraw
checks
from
the
fund
on
his
sole
signature.
at
the
trial,
one
of
the
alleged
signers
of
the
resolution
denied
his
signature.
however,
there
was
evidence
which
was
not
contradicted
that
other
officers
of
the
local
had,
in
fact,
signed
the
resolution.
admittedly,
the
practice
as
to
the
single
prior
fund
established
in
this
unit
by
the
union
had
been
to
have
the
checks
from
the
welfare
fund
countersigned
by
the
employer
representative
and
by
the
defendant
as
the
representative
of
the
employees.
this
was
on
march
2nd.
the
first
withdrawal
from
the
fund
was
on
march
16th,
that
is
the
first
withdrawal
on
which
the
government
introduced
evidence,
on
march
16th,
almost
three
weeks
after
the
date
as
of
which
the
defendant
is
alleged
to
have
violated
the
act
by
receiving
money
from
the
employer
and
almost
a
month
after
the
date
as
to
which
he
actually
took
physical
possession
of
the
two
checks
for
$15,000,
there
was
evidence
which
was
introduced
over
the
strenuous
objection
of
the
defendant
that
some
of
these
withdrawals
were
for
the
personal
benefit
of
the
defendant
or
for
board
union
but
non-welfare
fund
purposes
such
as
the
purchase
of
office
files
and
equipment
and
the
payment
of
union
salaries.
the
case
was
--
the
--
this
evidence
indicated
that
on
march
26th,
the
balance
remaining
on
the
first
bank
account
was
withdrawn
by
the
defendant
and
deposited
in
another
bank
account
in
a
general
union
account
as
to
which
he
again
had
sole
power
of
withdrawal.
and
the
government
again
presented
evidence
over
objection
as
to
withdrawals
in
this
account
extending
through
april
14th,
1953
or
almost
two
months
after
the
period
as
to
which
the
defendant
was
alleged
to
have
violated
the
act
by
receiving
money
from
the
employer.
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
instructions
that
if
you
should
find
that
the
defendant
had
complete
and
sole
control
of
the
fund
either
as
of
the
time
he
received
the
checks
or
as
of
the
time
he
deposited
them
on
the
bank,
you
should
find
the
defendant
guilty.
one
other
fact
is
relevant,
we
believe.
the
government
conceded
several
times
in
the
proceeding
below
that
the
employers
had
not
violated
the
act
because
they
had
made
their
payments
bona
fide
within
the
exemption
of
subsection
(c),
namely,
to
a
trust
fund
established
by
the
union.
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
on
such
a
record,
whatever
might
be
true
on
an
indictment
for
embezzlement
or
some
other
crime,
a
violation
of
section
302
was
not
made
out.
quite
the
contrary,
we
say
that
the
evidence
shows
a
payment
to
the
--
by
the
employer
to
the
defendant
within
the
expressed
exemption
of
subsection
(c)
covering
payments
by
the
employer
to
a
union
welfare
fund
established
by
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
john
r.
hally
i'm
not
sure
that
even
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
well,
having
in
mind
that
the
statute
contemplates
that
these
trust
funds
will
“be
established
by
the
employee
but
with
less
formality”,
there
would
be
true
of
a
probate
administered
trust.
i
would
say
that
even
with
the
emendation
your
honor
suggests
that
there
had
been
a
payment
to
a
trust
fund,
a
receipt
by
a
trust
fund
here.
the
money
have
been
put
in
a
bank
in
a
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
well,
i
would
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
but
i
think
that
the
trust
fund
had
--
had
vitality
here
as
shown
by
the
evidence
of
the
employer's
attempt
to
participate
in
this
administration
in
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
at
a
subsequent
period,
the
defendant
discussed
his
administration
of
the
fund
with
the
employer.
in
any
event,
i
wouldn't
think
that
that
intent
theory
in
which
the
government
relies
on
an
appeal
would
necessarily
bear
upon
the
suggestion
your
honor
made.
in
other
words,
in
that
case,
the
control
theory
on
which
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
might
be
more
relevant.
but
the
government
here
is
proceeding
upon
a
theory
that
the
defendant's
guilt
depends
upon
the
intent
with
which
he
receives
the
money.
mr.
john
r.
hally
that
is
a
portion
of
the
defendant's
case
here.
in
other
words,
this
statute
is
malum
prohibitum.
and
we
think
that
the
act
which
produces
criminality
should
be
definite
and
precise.
there
having
been
a
concession
that
the
payment
was
made
to
the
trust
fund
within
the
exception,
we
say
that
absent
proof
that
there
was
a
sham
considered
in
by
both
the
employer
and
the
defendant
to
make
this
a
bribe.
but
absent
that,
the
determination
of
criminality
should
depend
upon
those
facts.
and
we
rely
upon
the
facts
that
subsection
(e)
of
the
act
gives
equity
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
to
restrain
and
prevent
violations
of
the
so-called
trust
fund.
in
other
words,
congress
had
before.
and
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
302,
evidence
that
union
leaders
had
used
these
trust
funds
for
purposes
other
than
that
which
the
employer
had
purportedly
paid
them
over.
one
of
the
things
they
were
particularly
concerned
with
was
the
use
for
political
purposes
or
strike
funds.
accordingly,
congress
wrote
in
to
subsection
(c)
a
series
of
regulations
as
to
how
the
fund
should
be
administered,
limited
purposes
upon
which
it
could
be
expended.
but
since
the
use
of
those
moneys
for
those
broad
purposes
would
not
have
been
criminal
in
1947
and
1948,
we
suggest
that
you
cannot
infer
now
or
cannot
infer
that
congress
had
in
1947
and
1948
an
intent
to
make
them
criminal.
instead,
you
have
to
look
at
the
scheme
of
draftsmanship
of
302
and
conclude
that
in
giving
equity
jurisdiction
in
subsection
(e),
congress
was
looking
to
the
federal
courts
to
have
power
to
restrain
these
post
payment
episodes
and
incidents
in
a
manner
in
which
a
probate
court
or
a
court
in
equity
would
administer
a
trust,
in
other
words,
on
the
civil
side.
and
what
the
government
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
to
retroactively
create
criminality
from
episodes,
events
which
really
occurred
one
month,
even
two
months
after
the
period
of
the
event
of
which
the
indictment
deals
with
the
payment
and
receipt.
mr.
john
r.
hally
that
is
right.
we
say
that
is
the
only
case
of
sham.
one
of
the
arguments
of
the
government
here
is
that
our
argument
produces
the
possibility
of
sham.
we
say
it
produces
the
possibility
of
sham
only
if
you
concede,
assuming
the
first
case,
that
the
case
is
within
the
statute.
clearly,
if
the
employer
intended
to
buy
the
union
representative
by
casting
it
in
a
form
of
payment
to
the
welfare
fund
and
the
evidence
was
adduced
that
both
sides
knew
it,
then
it
would
be
a
case
of
bribery
within
the
expressed
purpose
of
(a)
and
(b)
because
that
is
another
reason
why
we
say
quite
apart
from
literally
applying
the
language
of
the
statute
to
our
acts,
we
rely
on
something
broader
than
that,
although
we
feel
that
under
principles
of
strict
construction
of
criminal
statutes,
it
would
be
sufficient
for
us
to
do
as
i
have
done
in
the
preceding
portion
of
my
argument,
literally
apply
the
language.
but
we
rely
upon
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
of
1947
and
1948
shows
that
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
were
directed
to
the
twin
crimes
of
bribery
and
extortion
and
the
impediments
they
imposed
upon
collective
bargaining
since
it
is
clear
that
what
happened
here
was
neither
bribery
nor
extortion,
we
say
that
the
act
does
not
apply,
that
is
subsection
(b)
does
not
apply
to
defendant's
conduct.
the
government
has
reviewed
the
legislative
history
which
is
put
out
in
our
brief
into
a
greater
extent
in
the
government's
brief,
and
agrees
with
us
that
the
prime
purpose
of
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
was
the
prevention
of
bribery
and
extortion.
however,
it
argues
an
additional
generalized
purpose,
which
i
shall
discuss
in
a
moment.
mr.
john
r.
hally
as
far
as
federal
law
would
be
concerned,
i
wouldn't
know.
i
will
assume
not.
this
would
be
a
case
governed
by
insular
law.
and
the
record
shows
on
page
20
that
at
the
time
the
defendant
proceeded
to
trial
here,
there
was
an
insular
indictment
that
is
in
the
state
courts
to
the
island
courts
for
embezzlement
pending
against
it.
and
so,
in
the
sense,
that
comes
back
to
our
case
that
the
--
there
is
no
need
to
stretch
302
to
deal
with
the
facts
of
this
case
because
it
was
either
dealt
with
by
state
or
insular
law.
it
is
dealt
with
the
state
and
insular
law
if
it
is
an
embezzlement
and
that
the
jury
shall
find
on
a
charge
of
indictment
for
embezzlement
or
302
was
not
intended
to
deal
with
it.
we
say
that
looked
at
broadly,
these
facts
would
represent
themselves
to
the
average
lawyers
if
it's
a
case
of
embezzlement.
assuming
that
true,
a
taking
from
the
trust
fund,
not
a
taking
from
the
employer
or
receiving
from
him
since
much
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
government
relies
covers
a
period
of
two
months
after
the
crucial
date,
it's
a
taking
from
the
trust
fund.
and
that
the
recent
legislative
activity
of
the
congress
in
which
they
have
exhaustively
reviewed
the
evidence
of
cases
of
personal
misuse
and
abuse
of
union
funds
and
union
trust
funds
for
the
benefit
of
leaders,
have
had
designed
and
propounded
legislation
to
cure
that,
is
the
strongest
legislative
history
showing
that
this
case
is
not
within
taft-hartley
as
it
was
enacted
in
1947
and
as
302
was
a
form
of
it.
congress
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
--
did
not
have
before
it
at
that
time
anything
more
than
the
use
by
union
leaders
of
the
funds
for
sweeping
purposes
such
as
political
purposes
or
strike
fund
benefits.
it
was
not
then
considering
this
question
of
abuse
for
personal
gain
of
abstractions.
and
the
strongest
evidence
that
as
--
to
repeat
myself,
is
that
senator
kennedy,
the
kennedy-ives
bill
of
the
last
term,
the
kennedy-irwin
bill
of
this
term
has
an
expressed
provision
in
it
which
would
cover
embezzlement
taking
and
manipulation
of
the
funds
which
would
clearly
cover
the
facts
of
this
case
and
would
permit
an
indictment.
mr.
john
r.
hally
i
believe
it
could
be
because
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
it's
a
--
it
is
a
bribery
statute.
mr.
john
r.
hally
well,
of
course,
there
again,
it
might
be
a
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
--
it
might
be
a
factual
question
as
a
practical
matter.
that
particular
episode
might
be
covered
under
subsection
--
under
the
exemption
of
2
of
(c)
(1)
payment
or
(c)
(1)
or
(c)
(4),
i
guess,
and
then
with
the
payment
of
the
employees
wages.
in
other
words,
that's
cut
out
from
the
flat
prohibition
of
(a),
the
employer
can
pay
the
union
man
his
wages
if
he's
a
shop
steward
or
on
the
payroll.
in
the
case,
your
honor,
of
course,
it
might
be
covered
as
a
practical
matter
by
that.
mr.
john
r.
hally
that
is
correct,
but
i
doubt
if
anything
turns
on
it.
the
government
has
not
argued
that.
nowhere
in
the
case
was
it
suggested
that
anything
other
than
the
intent
or
perhaps
the
power
of
the
defendant
over
this
fund
rendered
his
activity
illegal.
i
took
it
out
from
the
exemption
of
(c).
apparently,
the
practice
is
or
at
least
it
was
in
the
case
of
the
single
prior
fund
that
the
union
establishes
a
trust
fund
by
a
bank
account
because
it
goes
on
a
trust
fund
established
by
such
representative.
so
that
in
this
case,
it
was
paid
to
the
union
the
trust
fund
not
having
an
independent
legal
entity
or
existence
paid
to
the
union
and
with
vouchers
attached
showing
that
it
was
paid.
that,
i
think,
is
important.
the
vouchers
attached
to
the
check
showing
it
was
paid
to
the
trust
fund
so
that
i
think
in
effect,
that
it
would
have
been
paid
to
the
trust
fund
with
those
vouchers
attached
the
checks.
mr.
john
r.
hally
it
was
the
union
with
the
vouchers
as
i
have
said
attached
showing
that
it
was
payment
expressly
for
the
union
welfare
fund
established
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
same
day.
mr.
john
r.
hally
absolutely
devoid
because
of
this
expressed
concession
by
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
--
the
government
that
the
--
that
the
employer
was
absolutely
guiltless
that
bona
fide,
he
intended
to
make
its
payment
within
the
exemption
upon
which
we
rely.
mr.
john
r.
hally
yes.
mr.
john
r.
hally
it's
the
most
pleading
reference
but
it
is
in
the
record.
it's
on
page
20
and
it's
in
the
form
of
a
subpoena.
mr.
john
r.
hally
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
the
status
of
that
case.
to
answer
your
question,
it
is
for
the
crime
of
embezzlement.
that's
the
language
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
yes.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
that
is
ample
reason
not
to
strain
this
statute
with
the
broad
and
definite
legislative
history
of
relating
to
crimes
of
extortion
and
bribery
to
cover
this
case,
this
--
this
noble
case.
the
government
conceded
this
at
several
points
and
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
which
the
odd
constructional
theory
which
the
government
relies
on
here.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
government's
theory
does
not
warrant
a
different
result
from
the
one
from
which
i
have
been
arguing
or
call
for
a
different
reading
of
the
legislative
history.
as
i
understand
the
government's
theory,
they
review
the
legislative
history
to
find
the
sentiments
of
certain
senators
in
1947
and
1948
who
were
concerned
over
the
fact
that
union
funds
were
being
used
by
leaders
for
purposes
other
than
that
on
which
they
were
purportedly
paid
over.
and
specific
examples
were
given
in
the
debates
of
the
use
for
political
purposes,
the
republicans
being
in
power
at
the
time.
and
there
was
the
concern
over
the
use
of
strike
funds
that
they
might
overwhelm
small
employers
with
these
huge
sums
they
were
acquiring.
but
the
government
concludes
that
there
was
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
senators
to
prevent
these
funds
from
being
used
for
any
purpose
than
that
for
which
they
were
paid
on
a
specific
exemption
granted
in
subsection
(c).
and
from
that,
they
then
argue
that
if
the
payment
has
been
made
within
the
exemption
of
(c)
but
received
by
the
union
man
with
the
intent
at
the
time
to
make
another
use
of
it,
then
(b)
--
(b)
has
been
violated,
subsection
(b),
(a)
relates
to
employer.
we
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
not
--
not
under
302.
mr.
john
r.
hally
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
general
federal
statute
relating
to
embezzlement.
i
would
gather
not
based
on
this
current
legislative
history
of
congress.
mr.
john
r.
hally
well,
that's
just
what
we
contend
that
he
could
not
under
this
side.
there's
no
other
provision
of
taft-hartley.
mr.
john
r.
hally
no,
they
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
he
just
deposited
it
in
the
fund
and
then
there
was
the
evidence
of
these
withdrawals,
some
of
which
were
for
personal
benefit
from
which
the
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
no,
there's
selected
evidence.
the
total
--
the
charge,
the
indictment
is
for
receiving
$15,000
which
is
the
total
amount
of
the
employer's
contribution
of
fund.
the
government's
evidence
accounted
for
about
$2200
of
that
$15,000,
and
one
can
only
infer
that
much
of
the
other
withdrawals
were
either
legitimate
or
for
some
reason,
the
government
didn't
choose
to
put
them
in
evidence.
but
he
didn't
take
all
of
it
on
this
record
and
some
of
that
$2200
which
he
did
take
was
for
broad
union
purposes
such
as
office
files
or
equipment
but
the
government
argued
that
it
was
not
a
welfare
fund
purpose.
but
he
deposited
that
check
with
the
voucher
showing
that
it
was
a
payment
for
a
trust
fund
within
(c)
in
a
bank,
and
the
first
such
withdrawal
by
him
was
three
months.
i'll
strike
that
three.
mr.
john
r.
hally
in
the
name
of
the
union
trust
fund.
and
that
was
the
prior
practice.
and
i
think
--
well,
it
was
the
prior
practice
in
this
industry.
mr.
john
r.
hally
and
he
took
it
out
of
that
fund
three
weeks
for
the
first
time.
the
first
such
withdrawal,
it
was
only
a
small
partial
one
was
three
weeks
after
the
establishment
by
the
deposit
in
the
bank
of
the
trust
fund.
and
we
say
that
fact
is
significant
in
showing
the
extremely
strained
and
tangential
relationship
of
the
defendant's
activities
to
the
indictment
which
is
a
charge
of
receiving
from
the
employer
on
february
24th.
mr.
john
r.
hally
and
ran
away.
mr.
john
r.
hally
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
i
think
that's
the
hard
case.
mr.
john
r.
hally
that's
the
hard
case.
and
i
--
i
really
don't
have
made
my
mind
up
on
it.
i
--
i
think
possibly
--
certainly
that
could
go
to
a
jury
without
anybody
feeling
there'd
been
any
great
abuse,
i
think,
of
the
intent.
but
i
think
probably
logic
requires
me
to
say
that
even
that
case,
so
long
as
you
had
as
you
do
here,
the
expressed
concession
by
the
government
that
the
employer
had
bona
fide
made
his
payment
within
the
exemption
that
that
--
even
that
case
wouldn't
be
in
the
act
but
i
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
i
would.
mr.
john
r.
hally
i
do.
i
--
i
do,
aided
by
your
honor's
suggestion,
come
to
that
conclusion.
to
advert
again
to
the
government's
theory
that
the
jury
were
instructed
that
the
intent
with
which
the
defendant
took
this
money
and
approved
that
intent,
they
go
back
to
the
subsequent
takings.
it
was
crucial
to
his
guilt.
we
say
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
the
case
was
not
tried
on
that
theory.
the
instructions
of
the
judge
to
the
court
were
repeated.
they
appear
principally
on
record
237,
that
if
you
find
the
defendant
had
complete
and
sole
control
over
the
funds,
and
that's
said
twice
on
that
page,
you
shall
find
him
guilty,
a
known
instruction
as
of
which
the
defendant's
guilt
depended
upon
the
intent
with
which
he
received
the
money,
the
word
“intent”
which
is
certainly
a
word
of
art
in
the
criminal
law,
would
have
been
crucial
in
the
instruction
with
reference
to
the
defendant's
act.
but
that
word,
that
particular
word
is
no
way
used
--
the
word
“objective”
is
--
the
word
“intent”
is
no
way
used
in
the
judge's
instructions.
and
certainly,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
didn't
deal
with
this
case
as
having
been
presented
to
the
jury
on
any
theory
that
the
defendant's
guilt
depended
upon
his
intent
in
taking
the
money,
it
analyzed
it
that
his
guilt
depended
upon
the
control.
mr.
john
r.
hally
well,
i
think
even
in
that
case,
the
evidence
might
proceed
without
particular
examination
into
the
subjective
intents
of
the
parties.
for
example,
if
it
were
shown
that
the
employer
said
something
about
he
was
going
to
pay
off
the
fellow
or
something
like
that.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
--
it
--
i
don't
think
intent,
the
statute
after
all
is
malum
prohibitum.
and
this
court
has
so
characterized
that
the
intent
should
be
crucial.
and
i
would
not
admit
to
an
intent,
of
course,
possibly
to
determine
whether
there
had
been
a
sham
payment
intent
might
become
relevant.
but
certainly,
not
in
this
case
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
possibility
of
contention
of
sham.
the
--
as
i
say,
the
principal
--
the
dispositive
answer
to
the
government's
argument
is
the
case
was
not
tried
on
this
theory
of
intent.
and
as
this
court
said
in
jones
against
the
united
states
last
term,
the
government
cannot
sustain
on
appeal
a
case
or
a
conviction
on
a
theory
which
is
not
supported
by
the
record
below.
the
principal
other
reason
why
we
feel
that
the
statute
or
the
government's
theory,
particularly,
is
not
supported
or
is
not
correct,
is
that
they
misread
the
scheme
of
draftsmanship
of
302
and
ignore
the
equity
jurisdiction
given
in
subsection
(e)
to
the
courts
to
restrain
these
post
event
--
these
post
payment
and
receipt
activities.
congress
didn't
intend
to
make
them
criminal
on
the
basis
of
the
acts
and
events
appearing
days,
weeks
and
months
after
the
payment.
the
event
surrounding
the
fact
of
payment
was
where
to
determine
criminality.
the
subsequent
activities
which
might
constitute
an
abuse
of
trust
would
be
covered
by
the
equity
powers
of
court.
mr.
john
r.
hally
--
and
that
is
we
feel
the
unfairness
inherent
in
the
scope
of
the
evidence,
it
opens
up
to
use
by
the
government
in
such
a
trial.
we
have
charged
this
here
or
raised
it
as
a
second
question
namely
that
there
was
a
fatal
variance
between
--
fatal
and
prejudicial
variance
between
the
indictment
and
the
particulars
and
the
proof.
the
government
contends
that
we
have,
in
effect,
smuggled
a
question
in.
i
don't
--
i
feel
that
it
was
fairly
raised,
but
certainly,
it
was
not
expressly
raised
on
the
petition
for
a
certiorari,
but
we
feel
that
it's
clear
on
the
record.
the
defendant
here
was
indicted
for
receiving
$15,000
on
february
24th.
he
asked
for
particulars
and
the
government
said
it
was
--
it
was
received
in
the
form
of
two
checks,
for
$7500
each
on
february
21st.
at
that
point,
the
defendant
fairly
foresaw,
i
submit,
the
scope
approved
for
the
trial,
february
21st,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
february
24th.
instead
of
the
trial,
he
was
met
with
evidence
of
these
withdrawals
of
moneys
from
the
bank
accounts
extending
to
april
14th,
almost
two
months
after
the
date
specified
in
these
particulars.
even
if
this
is
not
available
to
us
as
in
the
point
on
appeal,
we
say
that
this
fact
cuts
to
the
invalidity
on
the
government's
theory.
because
certainly,
if
evidence,
two
months
after
the
date
which
section
302
deals
with,
namely,
the
receiving
or
the
paying
by
the
employer,
the
receiving
by
the
employee
can
be
used,
why
could
an
evidence
six
months,
eight
months,
a
year,
payments
to
welfare
funds
are
made
annually
under
such
a
scope
of
evidence,
the
entire
dealings
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
would
be
available
to
the
government
and
its
proof
in
all
trust
funds,
in
all
subsequent
breaches
of
them
could
be
brought
within
the
ambit
of
302,
which
should
be
clearly
contrary
to
the
obvious
intent
of
congress
in
now
dealing
with
taking
up
grappling
and
attempting
legislation
to
cover
this
whole
subject
of
misuse
for
personal
benefit
of
trust
fund
moneys.
mr.
john
r.
hally
your
honor
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
page
201,
the
court
says,
“i
deny
all
the
special
standards.”
mr.
john
r.
hally
six
special
charges
have
been
denied
of
this
counsel.
mr.
john
r.
hally
do
i
have
any
time?
mr.
john
r.
hally
i
believe,
i
have
a
minute.
i'd
--
mr.
john
r.
hally
because
the
government's
theory
of
this
case
varied
somewhat
from
the
lower
court
toward
appeal,
my
brief
in
all
aspects
doesn't
need
it,
so
i
would
like
to
take
this
time
to
point
out
the
principal
reasons
why
we
feel
this
theory
of
this
is
not
apt.
the
first
one,
i
renew
my
argument
that
the
instructions
do
not
support
the
government's
contention
that
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
an
intent
basis.
i've
said
during
my
argument
that
the
word
was
never
used
once,
with
reference
to
the
defendant's
conduct.
the
word
was
read
by
mr.
grimm
as
objective,
intend
as
a
word
of
art
in
the
criminal
law
and
if
the
judge
had
intended
to
submit
it
on
that
basis,
he
was
--
he
would've
used
that
intent.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
did
not
consider
that
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
that
basis.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
supported
by
the
record
below
this
theory.
in
the
lower
court,
the
government
had
a
different
theory,
this
theory
of
control,
if
the
defendant
had
complete
and
sole
control
over
the
fund,
then
this
crime
was
brought
within
the
act.
here,
we're
told
the
intent
--
the
theory
is
intent.
it's
not
supported
by
the
record.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
government's
reading
of
the
legislative
history
is
--
is
not
supported
by
the
statutory
analysis.
one
of
the
purposes
congress
was
obviously
concerned
with
would
be
the
union
leader
who
took
the
money,
pay
to
the
welfare
fund
and
then
later
decided
to
divert
it
without
any
contemporaneous
intent
decided
to
divert
it
to
political
purposes
or
the
strike
fund
purposes.
under
the
government's
theory,
you
couldn't
reach
that
man
even
though
congress
was
obviously
concerned
with
him
because
he
didn't
have
the
contemporaneous
intent.
the
government's
theory
puts
everything
upon
the
man
having
the
intent
to
use
it
for
the
unprescribed
purpose
at
the
time
he
received
the
money.
surely,
we
should
not
attribute
to
congress
an
intent
in
302
which
wouldn't
begin
to
reach
the
bulk
of
the
cases
which
the
congress
obviously
had
in
mind
in
enacting
that
statute.
that's
why
the
position
or
the
reading
of
the
statute
and
its
framework
which
we
contend
for,
is
the
only
one
who
accomplished
it.
namely,
that
these
events
which
happened
after
the
payment
and
receipt,
are
to
be
taken
cared
of
by
the
equity
powers
and
the
federal
jurors
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
referred
to
a
violation
of
say
the
arbitration
agreement,
provision
for
appointment
of
a
neutral
arbitrator,
provision
for
the
appointment
of
an
annual
audit.
surely,
all
of
these
things
which
could
only
happen
after
the
event
could
not
retroactively
make
the
payment
and
receipt
illegal.
the
congress
was
looking
there
to
the
equity
powers
on
the
civil
side
of
the
federal
court
to
cure
the
act.
and
they
were
not
looking
to
these
crimes
of
misuse
for
personal
purposes
even
with
intent
at
that
time.
and
they
are
now
looking
to
that
subject.
they
have
drafted
the
statute.
it
seems
with
--
on
the
eve
of
passage
in
some
form
or
another
which
would
clearly
cover
the
case,
there
was
no
reason
to
stretch
this
statute
and
this
is
certainly
a
stretching
to
cover
the
facts
of
this
case.
