suppose
a
man

suppose
a
man
had
paid
this
money
into
the
funds,
could
he
be
indicted
that
he
embezzled
the
(inaudible)
justice

(voice

federal
statute?
justice
hugo

black
could
be
under
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black
he
--
he
did
not
pay
the
money
into
the
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
--
the
labor
union
man
did
not
pay
into
the
fund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
you
mean,
he
took
all
the
evidence,
showed
he
took
it
up
later
of
the
fund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
deposited
in
a
bank
in
his
name.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
took
it
out
of
that
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
is
it
the
reason
he
could
not
be
indicted
for
embezzlement
there
on
the
evidence
that
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
going
to
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
embezzlement
of
these
funds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
same
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
didn't
he
have
sole
authority
under
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
money
paid
under
the
contract
which
gave
the
employer
partial
authority
over
the
funds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
such
a
mutual
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
the
agreement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
only
thing
that
the
deviation
then
from
this
is,
as
i
gathered,
that
that
the
man
put
the
money
in
a
new
deposit,
calling
it
welfare
fund
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
what
is
the
deviation
from
this,
specifically?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
his
duty
under
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
made
them
to
his
own
use,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
--
would
he
had
been
punishable
in
puerto
rico
by
forgery
and
by
embezzlement
under
those
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
have
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
forgery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
forgery
was
admitted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
be
embezzlement
when
he
takes
the
money
and
supposed
just
go
--
he
had
(inaudible)
collecting
that
money,
but
he
just
want
to
let
the
fund
that
he
got
it
out
and
convert
it
to
his
own
use?
wouldn't
that
be
embezzlement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
it's
larceny
by
trick?
is
that
punishable
in
puerto
rico?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
certainly
could
make
it
punishable
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
a
local
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
suggested
--
you
suggested
something
that's
causing
just
one
addition
about
this
--
about
this
being
a
sham.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
show
that
all
the
money
that
was
ever
paid
by
the
employer,
does
this
involve
all
that
was
ever
paid
on
account
of
the
welfare
fund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
were
the
charges
set
out
on
page
241
given
or
refused?
i
can't
tell
from
the
record.
justice

for
the

justice

the

was
the
second

second
given

justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
the
reason
i
have
to
get,
i
understood
your
case
--
you'd
rest
the
case
on
the
idea
that
he
had
not
deposited
the
check
that
implies
to
the
bargaining
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
charge
request
that
he'd
be
acquitted
that
the
jury
believed
that
he
had
deposited,
notice
was
illegal.
