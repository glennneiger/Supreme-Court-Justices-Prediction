mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
labor
racketeering
case
in
the
very
real
sense.
i
first
would
like
to
lay
one
ghost
that
has
arisen
with
respect
to
this
notation
on
page
20
of
the
record.
it
indicates
a
summons
for
trial
for
embezzlement.
i
made
an
inquiry
regarding
that
and
i've
been
informed
by
the
united
states
attorney
from
puerto
rico,
that
the
prosecution
of
arroyo
in
superior
court
ponce
division
involved
two
charges
for
embezzlement
of
funds
belonging
to
the
union
of
the
central
mercedita,
ponce
local,
committed
april
14th
and
may
11th,
1953.
jury
trial
was
held
and
arroyo
was
acquitted
march
12th,
1957,
which
was
after
this
prosecution.
in
any
event,
it's
clear
that
the
substance
of
the
charges
--
a
charge,
in
this
case,
was
not
the
substance
of
the
trial
in
puerto
rico
local
court.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
that's
the
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
that's
the
heart
--
that's
the
heart
of
our
argument
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
your
honor,
i'd
gather
from
the
statement
in
this
telegram
since
it
involved
in
--
an
embezzlement
from
the
union
that
it
was
not
the
same
as
the
charges
--
as
the
charges
in
this
case
that
is
the
substance
was
different.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
but
in
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
perhaps
so,
your
honor,
but
i
was
going
to
go
on
and
say
but
in
any
event,
that
would
be
the
second
trial.
you
see
and
there
was
it
--
it
would
raise
no
question
of
form
of
jeopardy
or
anything
of
the
sort
here,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
second,
i'd
like
to
turn
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
sir?
your
honor?
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
i
gather
from
the
information
which
i
have
that
they
are
not
the
same
transactions.
they
were
committed
on
different
dates.
here,
the
allegation
is
that
and
a
proof
is
that
the
offense
occurred
february
21st
and
in
the
local
trial
judging
from
this
charge
were
based
on
a
transaction
occurring
april
14th
and
a
later
one,
may
11th
which
was
well
beyond
the
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
same
year,
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
statute
now.
much
has
been
said,
but
i'd
like
to
outline
the
exact
language
of
the
statute.
on
page
2
and
3
and
4
of
the
government's
brief,
302
(b)
is
the
basis
of
this
prosecution.
and
302
(b)
says,
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
representative
of
any
employees
who
are
employed
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
to
receive,
or
accept,
or
to
agree
to
receive
or
accept
from
the
employer
of
such
employees
any
money
or
other
thing
of
value."
now,
(c),
"the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
not
be
applicable
--
and
skipping
down
to
5
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
"with
respect
to
money
or
other
thing
of
value
paid
to
a
trust
fund
established
by
such
representative
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
employees
of
such
employer
and
their
families."
and
then
on
page
4
at
the
top
of
the
page,
"provided
that
such
payments
are
held
in
trust
for
the
purpose
of
paying
medical
benefits
and
other
welfare
benefits
and
(b)
the
detailed
basis
on
which
such
payments
are
to
be
made
is
specified
in
a
written
agreement
with
the
employer
and
employees
and
employers
are
equally
represented
in
the
administration
of
such
fund."
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
petitioner
deposited
this
money
in
a
--
in
a
bank
account
labelled,
"welfare
fund"
is
not
at
all
important.
this
payment
was
illegal
unless
that
fund
was
jointly
administered.
there
had
to
be
employer
participation
and
dispensation
of
that
fund.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
not
at
all,
sir.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
not
at
all.
but
our
point
is
the
fact
that
the
bank
account
on
which
he
deposited
these
checks
was
labelled,
welfare
fund,
does
not
alter
the
case
at
all.
so
long
as
he
was
the
one
who
had
sole
control
over
that
fund
and
sole
authority
to
dispense
the
funds,
the
receipts
of
the
money
was
illegal
and
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
sir?
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
sir?
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
on
page
26
of
the
record,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
by
the
parties
contained
article
6.
article
6
reads
as
follows
that
is
impertinent
part,
"the
employer
shall
--
shall
establish
a
fund
which
shall
be
known
as
the
welfare
fund
in
the
amount
of
$15,000."
and
then
it
specifies
the
things
for
which
this
fund
can
be
spent.
and
then
the
last
paragraph,
"this
welfare
fund
shall
be
administered
by
a
committee
that
will
be
appointed
by
mutual
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
the
committee
thus
appointed
shall
furnish
the
employer
monthly,
with
a
written
statement
of
the
disbursements
made
from
said
fund."
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
well,
that
--
this
is
--
this
is
the
agreement,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
this
is
the
agreement
which
was
signed
on
february
21st,
1953.
now
to
--
to
put
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
from
the
facts
which
you've
heard
so
far,
your
honor,
you
would
gather
that
impression.
but
that
is
not
the
fact
that
was
proved
at
the
trial
and
that's
why
i'd
like
to
go
on
to
the
facts
a
little
more.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
the
--
the
deviation
is
simply
this.
these
parties
have
been
negotiating
together
for
--
well,
ever
since
1949.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
petitioner
as
president
of
his
union
local
has
served
as
chief
negotiator
for
the
union
and
a
mr.
goyco
has
served
as
negotiator
for
the
employers.
now,
there
were
two
employers,
but
they
were
operated
as
one
enterprise.
and
they
had
been
negotiating
since
1949.
there
had
been
a
previous
contract
entered
into
for
the
year
1952.
that
contract
provided
for
the
establishment
of
a
welfare
fund
in
the
sum
of
$15,000.
the
previous
fund
was
to
be
dispensed
under
joint
control
by
a
committee.
it
had
been
dispensed
under
joint
control
by
a
committee.
it
had
pending
disbursement.
it
had
been
deposited
in
a
bank
account
established
in
the
bank
of
ponce,
puerto
rico.
that
bank
account
was
still
in
existence
and
two
signatures,
one
for
the
union
and
one
for
the
employer
were
required
to
draw
checks
against
that
account.
now,
when
they
were
negotiating
this
new
contract,
the
question
came
up
as
to
who
was
to
serve
on
the
disbursement
committee
for
this
welfare
fund.
at
that
time,
petitioner
affirmatively
stated
that
he
wanted
to
be
the
union
representative
on
this
disbursing
committee.
now,
he
had
been
the
representative
on
the
previous
committee
as
well.
and
so,
that
was
no
novelty.
but
this,
we
claim,
as
a
false
representation,
because
it,
at
least,
it
clearly
indicated
to
the
employer
that
he
was
willing
to
accept
the
principle
of
joint
control
over
this
fund.
and
that
was
the
only
basis
upon
which
the
fund
could
be
established
and
that
was
one
of
the
things
which
the
employer
have
in
mind
when
returned
the
check
over
to
him.
now,
there
is
a
second
item
here.
at
the
time
the
contract
was
signed,
the
previous
year,
the
welfare
fund
had
been
deposited
by
a
representative
of
the
employer.
however,
petitioner
stated
that
he
wanted
to
show
the
checks
to
a
meeting
of
the
employees
to
be
held
that
evening.
and
he
agreed
to
deposit
those
checks
in
the
then
existing
welfare
fund
bank
account
in
the
bank
of
ponce,
puerto
rico.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
that
--
that
was
his
--
that
was
his
duty
under
the
verbal
understanding
with
the
employer
at
the
time
that
the
checks
were
turned
over
to
him.
on
that
basis,
because
of
his
official
position
as
president
and
chief
negotiator,
because
he
had
previously
served
on
the
welfare
fund
committee,
because
he
had
nominated
himself
to
be
a
member
of
the
new
committee,
because
he
agreed
to
deposit
the
checks
in
the
then
existing
bank
account
which
required
two
signatures
to
--
to
withdraw
funds
from
that
account,
on
that
basis,
the
checks
were
turned
over
to
him.
now,
instead
of
depositing
those
checks
in
the
then
existing
bank
account,
he
took
those
checks
to
a
different
bank,
the
national
city
bank
of
ponce,
puerto
rico,
and
he
opened
a
new
account.
and
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
your
honor.
now,
that
new
account
was
labeled,
welfare
fund,
but
he
deposited
the
check
in
--
in
the
new
bank
account
and
a
few
days
later,
he
turns
up
with
the
union
resolution,
but
purports
to
be
a
resolution
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
union
and
that
resolution
says,
"that
as
a
result
of
consideration
by
the
union
board
of
directors,
we
have
authorized
the
petitioner
to
draw
upon
this
welfare
fund
on
his
own
signature."
now,
we
showed,
the
government
proved
that
trial,
presented
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
infer
that
that
resolution
was
spurious,
from
beginning
to
last.
the
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors
which
purportedly
had
passed
that
resolution
never
took
place.
there
were
two
signatures
appearing
on
that
resolution
at
the
time
it
was
introduced
in
evidence,
one
was
petitioners',
one
was
--
belonged
to
a
silvagnoli,
the
union
secretary.
silvagnoli
testified
his
signature
was
a
forgery.
petitioner
presented
testimony
from
witnesses,
the
union
vice
president
for
instance,
testified
--
well,
he
had
signed
this
resolution
originally,
but
it
had
been
torn
at
the
bottom
and
perhaps
his
--
his
signature
has
been
torn
off
that
is
at
least
--
that
was
the
inference
he
wanted
to
convey.
but
even
that
witness
--
the
defense
witness
conceded
that
silvagnoli's
signature,
the
signature
of
the
union
secretary
appeared
to
be
a
forgery.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
provided
that
puerto
rico
has
a
fairly
standard
--
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
i
would
say
no.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
for
forgery.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
that
the
signature
--
by
that
i
meant
to
say
that
the
signature
was
false.
it
was
false.
but
i
understand
forgery
to
--
well,
no.
i
said,
yes,
it
would
be
a
forgery
because
he
used
it
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
we
say
no,
your
honor.
that
is
larceny
by
trick
because
from
the
very
beginning,
from
the
very
moment
that
he
received
those
checks
and
converted
them
into
money,
he
had
no
intent
except
to
convert
them
to
his
own
use.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
but
it's
certainly
punishable
by
section
302
(b)
and
this,
we
show,
through
the
legislative
history
of
the
section.
now,
back
to
this
question
of
forgery,
since
he
presented
this
resolution
to
the
bank
and
cause
the
bank
to
rely
upon
it,
in
--
in
permitting
--
in
changing
the
signature
card
or
permitting
a
signature
to
be
cut
--
card
to
be
made
out
on
his
own
signature,
it
might
constitute
forgery
under
puerto
rican
law,
although,
as
i
say,
i'm
not
specific
as
to
puerto
rican
law.
but
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
as
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
--
a
statute
--
a
local
statute
could
be
drawn,
i
suppose,
that
would
make
it
punishable
as
forgery
in
which
would
fall
within
what
we
--
we
regard
as
a
reasonable
statement
of
the
crime
of
forgery.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
of
the
employer
representative
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
your
honor,
if
he
can
assume
by
as
part
of
the
question
that
here
--
that
that
was
his
intent
from
the
moment
he
got
the
checks
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
--
and
that
he
always
had
a
fraudulent
intent.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
then,
i
would
say
that
he
either
committed
larceny
by
trick
or
false
pretenses.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
they
would
fall
under
302
(b),
whereas
embezzlement
we
--
at
least
as
this
case
was
tried,
the
embezzlement
would
not.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
your
honor,
is
it
---
is
it
part
of
the
question
that
from
the
very
moment
he
received
the
checks,
he
had
this
intent
to
convert
it
to
his
own
use?
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
and
of
course
he
maintained
personal
control
over
it,
so
nobody
else
could
divert
it
while
--
or
at
least,
took
some
steps
so
it
would
be
available
to
him.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
but
then
because
he
had
some
sort
of
personal
control.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
so
long
as
--
so
long
as
it
is
true
that
he
had
that
--
entertain
that
intent
from
the
beginning
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
--
then
we
have
larceny
by
trick
punishable
by
this
section
and
not
embezzlement.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
difficulty
is
that
arises
only
theoretically
because
as
a
practical
matter
when
you
put
the
question
to
a
jury
when
you
can
--
when
the
petitioner
could
show
that
a
valid
deposit
was
made
and
perhaps
some
of
the
money
spent
for
a
welfare
fund
purpose
under
joint
disbursement
and
then
later
a
forged
check
--
he
uses
a
forged
check
to
draw
funds
from
it,
then
it
is
almost
certain
that
a
jury
will
infer
--
well
the
funds
was
validly
established.
and
there
was
once
upon
a
time,
at
least,
a
valid
welfare
fund
from
which
he
later
embezzled
money.
but,
of
course,
so
long
as
we
can
assume
as
part
of
the
question
that
he
never
intended
to
permit
the
establishment
of
the
valid
welfare
fund,
then
we
have
larceny
by
trick
punishable
by
section
302
(b).
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
so
long
as
you
have
some
sort
of
evidence
by
which
you
can
pierce
the
sham
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
--
that
he
uses,
as
we
--
as
we
had
here
then
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
and
thus
far,
i
carried
the
facts
to
the
point
where
he's
deposited
the
money.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
the
committee
was
to
--
yes.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
there
--
there
was
a
verbal
agreement
between
the
party
that
goyco
was
to
represent
the
employer
and
petitioner
was
to
represent
the
employee.
and
if
you
will
read
the
statute
closely,
it
is
only
necessary
to
have
two
parties,
one
for
the
representative
and
one
for
the
employer.
it's
not
necessary
to
have
a
neutral
party,
however,
it
is
customary
to
have
a
neutral
party,
a
third
person.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
whether
it
satisfied
the
statute
as
being
a
proper
welfare
fund?
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
that's
quite
true,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
no,
sir.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
because
the
fund
in
which
he
deposited
the
checks
could
be
drawn
upon
by
him
alone.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
no,
sir.
it
was
expressly
agreed
between
the
parties
at
the
time
the
contract
was
signed
that
the
checks
would
be
deposited
in
the
then
existing
welfare
fund
bank
account
and
two
signatures
were
required
to
draw
funds
from
that
account,
petitioners
and
the
representative
of
the
employer.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
your
honor,
that
came
--
that
--
there
--
there
is
no
testimony
to
that
affect.
that
was
in
the
false
resolution
which
he
presented
to
the
bank.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
that's
correct,
you
--
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
and
therefore,
the
--
a
valid
welfare
fund
never
came
into
existence
since
it
did
not
--
the
payment
was
an
illegal
payment,
the
receipt
--
well,
the
receipt
by
petitioner
was
an
illegal
receipt.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
or
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
or
must
the
government
negative
the
exception.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
i
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
as
a
matter
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
the
government
negative
the
exceptions.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
so
that
we
do
not
reach
it
here.
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
evidence
now
what
happened
after
he
deposited
this
money.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
its
obligation
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
was
it
technically
lawful,
a
technically
lawful
payment?
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
i
suppose,
strictly
speaking,
the
check
should've
been
made
payable
to
the
welfare
fund
instead
of
to
the
union.
however,
since
they
had
agreed
that
it
was
to
be
deposited
in
the
then
existing
bank
account
and
because
they
had
agreed
as
to
who
their
representatives
were
to
be
on
the
committee
dispersing
the
fund,
then
the
situation
is
just
as
though
they
had
handed
the
checks
to
any
other
person
whom
they
trusted
and
said,
“take
these
down
to
the
bank
and
deposit
them.”
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
and
it
would
satisfy
their
obligation
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
--
and
under
the
law.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
of
--
of
course,
the
embezzlement,
if
the
fund
had
ever
been
established
--
here,
let
me
say
that
the
chief
reason
why
we're
willing
to
say
that
embezzlement
does
not
fall
under
section
302
(b)
is
because
the
case
was
tried
on
that
theory.
the
judge
expressly
ruled,
well,
if
this
fund
had
been
established
and
any
embezzled
that
wouldn't
be
under
the
act,
but
it
is
the
way
it
--
the
jury
can
find
that
it
is
under
the
act
this
way.
and
so
the
question
--
there,
the
embezzlement
would
be
from
the
fund.
now,
i
would
suppose
that
the
legal
title
to
that
fund
rests
in
the
trustee,
one
of
them
being
the
employer's
representative.
and
that
the
beneficial
interest
in
that
fund
rests
in
the
employee.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
oh
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
oh,
yes.
but
that's
--
that's
where
his
argument
would
necessarily
lead.
that
the
--
that
the
section
would
cover
only
bribery
and
extortion.
and
in
fact,
perhaps
it
actually
wouldn't
even
cover
that
if
you
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
you
mean
--
you
mean
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
--
you
mean
he'd
--
he'd
like
to
read
it
that
way?
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
oh,
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
say,
no.
certain
--
certainly
at
least,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
a
welfare
fund
which
is
simply
a
sham
which
is
(inaudible)
certainly
the
law
is
not
so
feeble
as
to
be
unable
to
penetrate
that
and
that
is
our
case
here.
but
even
so,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
shows
very
clearly
that
congress
wanted
to
forbid
all
payments
from
the
employers
to
employees
except
certain
ones.
one
of
the
certain
ones
they
are
willing
to
authorize
were
welfare
fund
payments.
but
that
was
authorized
only
if
it
was
made
in
a
certain
way
for
a
specified
purpose
under
dual
control.
and
so
a
welfare
fund
payment
which
went
to
a
fund
which
was
not
under
dual
control,
would
be
an
illegal
payment,
an
illegal
payment
under
this
section
and
that
is
provided
with
the
employer,
did
it
knowingly,
and
if
he
thought
that
there
was
to
be
dual
control
and
the
representative
took
it
not
intending
dual
control
which
is
this
case,
it's
an
illegal
payment,
absolutely
illegal.
i
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
a
sham.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
your
honor,
i
wanted
--
i've
been
trying
to
get
to
the
fact
after
the
deposit
for
sometime
here.
this
is
what
happened.
he
made
this
deposit
and
he
presents
this
resolution
and
then
a
few
days
later,
he
begins
writing
checks.
now
the
first
thing
he
did
was
transfer
$1300
to
his
personal
checking
account.
and
then
he
drew
a
check
against
the
fund
for
cash
and
he
endorsed
it
and
he
gave
it
to
a
pontiac
dealer
as
a
down
payment
on
a
new
automobile.
and
then
a
few
days
later,
goyco,
the
employer's
representative,
found
out
that
the
money
hadn't
been
deposited
in
the
welfare
fund
bank
account
and
he
protested.
and
so
petitioner
went
down
--
petitioner
stated,
“well,
i'm
going
to
control
this
fund
by
myself.”
and
he
went
down
and
he
withdrew
the
rest
of
the
money
or
the
bank
asked
him
to
withdraw
it,
but
in
any
event,
10
days
after
he
started
to
draw
upon
this
account,
there
was
--
he
had
spent
over
--
there
were
over
$5000
was
gone
from
the
$15,000.
and
so
he
took
the
balance
now
over
into
some
$9800
and
he
put
that
in
a
general
union
account.
and
then
he
continued
to
draw
against
it
for
personal
purposes.
he
paid
off
--
he
paid
for
a
refrigerator
which
he
had
purchased
and
he
paid
for
a
household
furnishing
and
then
he
bought
some
furniture
equipment
for
union
officers
and
diverted
--
diverted
it
in
that
way.
and
then
eventually,
he
comingled
it
with
general
union
funds,
so
that
became
a
loss,
of
course,
forever.
now
--
well,
shortly
after
he
did
that,
he
called
it
--
he
expelled
the
union
--
the
union
secretary
from
the
union.
the
union
secretary
was
normally
required
to
draw
checks
against
general
union
funds,
you
see.
and
so,
he
expelled
the
secretary
from
the
union
and
called
a
meeting
of
the
workers
and
announced
that
he
wanted
to
write
--
the
right
to
draw
checks
against
general
union
funds
on
his
own
signature,
you
see.
and
thereafter,
he
did
draw
upon
general
union
funds
into
which
the
--
the
balance
of
the
welfare
fund
had
been
forged.
now,
it's
true
that
--
of
course,
i
confess
that
mr.
hally
and
i
are
a
part
on
this
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
government
proved
a
specific
diversion
of
over
$3000
of
this
money.
but
as
to
the
balance,
none
of
it
went
it
to
the
proper
welfare
fund
into
the
preexisting
welfare
fund
bank
account.
and
petitioner
never
did
account
for
it.
and
steadfastly
refused
to
account
for
it,
even
though
as
to
time
and
time
again
and
never
had
to
this
day.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
i
--
i
think
so.
very
early,
you
stated
that
perhaps
section
(c)
should
--
could
be
read
to
require
of
the
mutuality
or
reciprocity
of
some
sort.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
i
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
and
you
--
and
you
would
say
then
that
it's
enough
if
one
party
complies
with,
you
know.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well
that
--
there
--
that
takes
us
directly
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
302
(b)
and
it
was
well
laid
out
there
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
to
try
and
put
it
as
briefly
as
i
can.
section
302
came
in
to
the
law.
well,
at
first
arose
in
1946.
at
that
time
we
just
had
a
steel
strike,
a
general
motors
strike
and
united
mine
workers
were
then
on
strike.
and
one
of
the
contentions
of
the
united
mine
workers
was
this,
they
refused
to
negotiate
further
until
the
operators
agreed
to
pay
a
royalty
of
10
cents
a
ton,
on
every
ton
of
coal
mined.
now,
mr.
lewis
stated
this
money
is
to
go
into
a
fund.
that
fund
will
be
used
to
pay
pensions,
to
pay
welfare,
medical
benefits
and
to
provide
educational
aid
to
minors.
now,
mr.
--
senator
byrd
offered
an
amendment
to
the
case
bill
which
was
pending
at
that
time.
and
case
bill
was
designed
to
amend
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
he
said,
“well,
we
want
to
forbid
this
kind
of
payment
unless
there's
some
sort
of
control
over
it.”
and
after
much
discussion,
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
authorize
welfare
funds,
but
that
some
sort
of
control
should
be
provided.
senator
ball
offered
an
amendment
to
byrd's
original
amendment
which
cast
section
302
in
almost
exactly
the
form
which
it
has
today.
and
he
said
at
that
time
and
we
quote
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
he
said
at
that
time,
"that
if
they
weren't
very
careful,
these
welfare
funds
might
be
used
for
organizational
activities
or
something
of
that
sort."
and
as
he
said,
after
all,
mr.
lewis
might
regard
that
as
educational
aid
to
miner
--
to
mining
industry
or
to
miners.
now,
here's
a
clear
case
where
he
--
where
he
envision
the
giving
of
the
money
for
a
proper
purpose,
that
is
a
welfare
fund
purpose,
but
accepted
with
a
hidden
intent
to
use
it
for
something
else,
to
use
it
for
organizational
activities.
and
similarly,
of
course,
section
302
then
passed
as
far
as
the
case
bill
was
vetoed
by
the
president
and
in
1947,
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
passed,
senator
ball
again
offered,
302
from
the
floor
of
the
senate.
and
at
that
time
he
stated
that
he
wanted
to
ensure
unless
we
--
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
this
is
a
statement
with
which
he
introduced
section
302
(b).
unless
we
make
sure
that
such
funds,
welfare
funds,
when
they
are
established,
are
really
trust
funds
--
trust
funds
and
are
actually
used
for
the
benefit
to
employees
specified
in
the
agreement.
there
is
a
very
grave
danger
that
the
funds
will
be
used
for
the
personal
gain
of
union
leaders
or
for
political
purposes
or
other
purposes
not
contemplated
when
they
are
--
when
they
are
established.
now,
this
--
clearly
here,
he
envisioned
the
case
where
the
money
is
given
for
a
proper
welfare
purpose,
but
accepted
with
a
secret
intent
to
use
it
for
another
and
improper
purpose.
and
congress
specifically
intended
to
require
that
both
parties
must
intend
to
establish
a
welfare
fund
before
this
payment
would
be
lawful.
now,
senator
ball's
comments
are
not
the
isolated
comments
of
simply
one
senator
from
the
floor
of
the
senate.
and
similarly,
senator
byrd
and
senator
noland
and
senator
taft,
their
remarks
which
we
have
set
forth
in
considerable
detail,
which
i've
attempted
to
summarize
very
hurriedly
here,
are
far
more
persuasive
than
you
--
than
in
the
usual
case
because
these
senators
proposed
302
as
an
amendment
to
the
case
bill
in
1946.
they
protested
the
omission
of
302
from
the
committee
bill
of
the
senate
in
1947.
they
offered
302
from
the
floor
of
senate
in
1947
and
got
it
accepted.
they
prevailed
upon
the
house
to
receive
in
1947
and
-
and
accepted
in
the
conference
bill
as
they
put
across
the
whole
taft-hartley
act
toward
the
president's
veto.
now,
these
are
not
isolated
comments.
these
are
the
statements
of
the
men
who
did
the
most
to
put
302
into
the
law.
they
demanded
mutual
--
they
demanded
that
both
parties
act
honestly
and
with
an
honest
purpose.
and
the
fact
that
the
employer
thought
he
was
contributing
to
a
bonafide
trust
fund
is
not
controlling
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
would
not
be
a
payment
to
a
welfare
fund.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
i
would
--
i
would
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
sort
of
knowing
--
at
all
events,
in
this
case,
it's
immaterial
because
clearly
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
what
this
was
not
of
innocent
diversity.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
or
will
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
entertain
the
kind
of
evil
intent
shown
here.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
necessarily,
that
is
an
intent
to
divert
it
to
his
personal
use.
i
think
that
if
he
intended
to
divert
to
a
political
activity,
for
example,
that
would
be
unlawful.
or
intended
to
do
divert
it
to
many
other
purposes
which
might
be
even
proper
--
even
laudable,
there
are
many
instances
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
i
--
i
would
think
that
would
not
be
a
violation.
i
would
think
that
so
--
so
long
as
there
is
substantial
compliance
with
these
two
requirements,
one,
dual
control,
and
number
two,
proper
welfare
purposes
that
is
medical
benefits,
pensions
and
things
of
that
sort.
that
if
there
was
a
technical
shortcoming,
that
is
a
failure
perhaps,
to
--
well,
in
this
case,
the
drawing
of
the
check
to
the
union
instead
of
the
welfare
fund,
of
course,
i
think
it
would
be
very
deep.
i
would
hate
to
take
that
case
to
a
jury.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
they
would
hurt
(inaudible)
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
but
union
purpose
--
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
your
honor.
because
a
welfare
fund
is
not
given
for
the
union,
it's
given
for
the
employees,
sir.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
oh,
yes.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes,
sir.
congress,
i
think,
showed
very
clearly
--
remember
here,
one
of
the
requirements
of
the
section
is
that
(a)
on
the
top
of
page
4,
"such
payments
are
held
in
trust
for
the
purpose
of
paying
--
either
paying
welfare
benefits.
and
(b),
the
detailed
basis
on
which
such
payments
are
to
be
made
is
specified
in
a
written
agreement."
in
other
words,
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
welfare
payments
would
be
welfare
payments.
and
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
specify
that
the
fund
out
of
which
you
pay
pensions
must
be
a
separate
fund
from
that
out
of
which
you
pay
medical
benefits.
and
i
think
this
was
to
ensure
that
the
pension
fund
could
be
set
up
on
a
sound
financial
basis
and
some
of
the
--
and
to
ensure
that
some
of
the
employees
would
not
later
find
that
the
money
had
run
out.
these
funds
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
--
of
the
worker,
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
union
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer
necessarily
except
in
the
sense
that
each
will
get
better
performance
from
the
worker
as
a
result
of
them.

those

there

i

i

that

however,

the

go

mr.

yes,
that's
it.
mr.
eugene
s.
grimm
yes.
however,
i
should
--
i
should
say
here
about
the
charge
in
this
case
as
we've
indicated
on
page
10
of
the
brief.
he
gave
a
charge
which
submitted
this
issue
to
the
jury
saying
that,
"if
the
employer,
in
delivering
money,
deliver
--
delivers
it
for
the
exclusive
purpose
of
creating
a
fund,
the
representative
receiving
that
money,
must
have
the
same
objective
in
mind.
now,
if
his
objective
is
different
and
if
he
gets
hold
of
the
money
and
does
not
comply
with
the
provisions
of
this
section
as
to
the
fund,
then
he
cannot
claim
of
what
the
employer
said
must
guide
you,
you
must
be
guided
simply
by
what
happened.
what
were
the
circumstances
under
which
this
money
came
in
to
the
possession
of
the
defendant?
if
you
believe
that
from
the
time
the
defendant
received
said
sum
of
money
from
the
employers,
he
had
complete
and
sole
control
of
said
money
in
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
--
agreement
and
the
law
and
utilize
such
money
or
any
part
of
it
for
his
personal
benefit,
then
i
charge
you
that
the
defendant
has
violated
the
above
mentioned
section
of
the
law.
now,
here,
the
entire
context
--
sometimes
he
uses
the
word,
"control",
sometimes
he
uses
the
word,
"motives",
sometimes
he
uses
the
word,
"intent".
but
so
far
as
he
uses
motive
and
intent,
he
means
the
same
thing.
and
that,
i
think,
is
shown
by
the
context
of
his
remarks.
and
he
submitted
to
the
jury
the
sole
question
that
there
is
in
this
case
and
we
contend
that
question
is
this.
we
say
that
the
evidence
to
show
that
from
the
negotiation
of
this
contract
onward
from
that
very
moment
on,
petitioner
had
no
intention
to
do
anything
except
get
hold
of
that
money
for
his
personal
use
and
that
he
never
did
anything
except
things
that
enabled
him
to
get
that
personal
control
over
the
funds.
and
that
was
a
theory
upon
which
this
case
went
to
the
jury.
did
he
accept
the
money
for
funds
or
for
--

that's
right,
