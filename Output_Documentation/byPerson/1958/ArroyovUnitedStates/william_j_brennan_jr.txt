before
you
sit
down,
mr.
grimm,
i
gather
any
variance
for
the
requirements
of
(a),
(b)
and
(c)
to
isolate
the
inefficient,
the
government's
position
would
be
a
payment
to
such
a
fund
would
not
be
a
payment
when
authorized.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
is
that
to
say
as
--
that
those
were
some
those
rather
complicated
requirements.
suppose
in
all
innocence,
one
of
those
requirements
is
not
met
and
employer
paid
a
union
leader
or
an
employer
paid
a
fund,
though
it's
not
--

--
necessary
to
the
conduit
of
the
union
leader

j.
brennan,

are
you
--
are
you
--
is
the
government
limiting
its
position
though
the
situation
where
you
suggest
is
a
case
here.
he'd
never
had
any
intention
of
receiving
it
as
a
payment
for
a
pension
fund?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
paying
it
at
the
--
that
happened
to
be
an
indictment
against
the
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
when
i
just
want
to
have
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
that
even
--
that
if
actually,
the
intent
was
to
pay
or
to
receive
moneys
for
a
pension
fund,
the
fact
that
there
were
imperfection
in
the
sense
that
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
were
not
complied
with
to
the
letter,
would
not
create
a
violation?
