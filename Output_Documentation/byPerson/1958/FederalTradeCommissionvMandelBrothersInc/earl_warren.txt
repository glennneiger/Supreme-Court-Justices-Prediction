chief
justice
earl

the
--
before
you
proceed,
mr.
friedman,
i
just
--
i
just
say
you
don't
need
to
be
seated.
the
order
--
the
other
orders,
that
court
appear
upon
the
list
certified
by
the
chief
justice
and
filed
with
the
clerk
and
will
not
be
orally
announced.
thank
you
for
very
much
--
now,
mr.
friedman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
there
--
there
are
two
phrases
or
--
or
two
words
that
are
used
in
this
case
that
bothered
me
a
little,
one
of
them
is
invoice
and
i'd
like
to
know
if
there's
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
term
“invoice”
is
or
is
not
used
in
the
retail
trade
as
it
is
in
the
wholesale
trade.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
take
it
off
from
the
legislative
history.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
whether
the
term
“commercial
transaction”
is
used
by
congress
in
connection
with
retail
transactions
as
well
as
wholesale
transactions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
horne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
consider
this
in
the
trade
as
an
invoice,
the
--
the
document
which
appears
at
66
(a).
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
just
said
--
you
just
said
they
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
--
now
may
i
--
may
i
ask
this.
do
you
concede
that
the
--
that
the
term
“invoice”
is
a
--
an
appropriate
term
and
is
used
in
the
retail
business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
horne,
let's
take
this
situation.
i
notice
in
the
--
in
the
record
that
mandel
brothers
do
a
lot
of
other
state
business
too.
that
is
people
come
to
this
store
and
--
and
have
a
good
shipped
out
of
the
state.
suppose
they
ship
this
--
this
fur
that
we're
talking
about
from
--
from
chicago
to
new
york,
and
send
it
c.o.d.
to
the
customer,
and
they
issued
some
kind
of
a
--
of
a
document
to
indicate
what
the
price
was
and
what
the
article
was
and
so
forth,
what
would
you
call
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
no,
we
were
labeling
this
from
a
--
the
carrier.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
horne,
if
i
--
i
apologize
for
asking
so
many
questions,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
friedman
about
the
term
"commercial
transaction"
or
as
you
say,
“commercially.”
i'd
like
to
know
if
there's
anything
in
the
record
or
in
the
cases
that
indicate
that
that
term
is
limited
to
--
to
the
wholesale
trade
or
--
or
whether
it's
applied
equally
to
or
at
times
to
--
to
the
retail
trade.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
it
your
--
isn't
it
your
position
that
you
didn't
instruct
them
to
do
anything
so
far
as
this
invoice
is
concerned
because
you
didn't
believe
you're
obliged
to
under
the
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
that
was
within
two
months
of
the
--
of
the
act
going
onto
effect
in
1952?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1954.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
afraid
mr.
horne,
i
--
i
totally
misconceived
what's
your
position
is.
i
thought
your
position
in
this
case
was
that
you
are
not
obliged
to
have
any
--
any
of
this
material
on
the
invoice
or
sales
tags
or
whatever
we
choose
to
call
it.
and
that
you
therefore
--
therefore,
you
could
not
be
ordered
to
cease-and-desist
because
the
statute
didn't
require
you
to
put
it
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
is
your
position
that
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
law
does
or
does
not
require
the
retailer
to
give
an
invoice,
which
will
include
this
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
does
it
require
any
kind
of
an
invoice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
you
claim
that's
not
applicable
to
you
because
you're
a
retailer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
say
that
you're
--
you're
conforming
to
it
and
it
was
only
some
slight
deviations
that
they
found
in
your
invoices.
is
that
essential
to
the
case
if
you
don't
have
to
--
have
to
comply
with
the
--
the
invoice
portion
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
but
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
then
if
you
do
have
to
comply,
then
the
only
question
we
have
to
determine
is
whether
all
of
those
things
are
included
on
your
invoice,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
horne,
your
time
is
about
up,
but
we
have
taken
so
much
of
your
time
asking
--
asking
questions.
i
think
you're
entitled
with
few
minutes
of
--
uninterrupted
argument
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
minutes
extra
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
state
what
you
want
to
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
if
you
would
like
to
sum
up
your
argument
and
put
it
in
perspective
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
