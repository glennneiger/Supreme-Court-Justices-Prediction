justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
is
right,
what
in
your
judgment
is
a
scope
of
protection
given
by
the
act
as
construed
by
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
under
your
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
you
construction,
then
what
--
what
is
the
scope
of
the
protection
given
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
any
of
this
--
does
the
--
the
act
has
construed
either
way,
affect
the
right
of
the
merchant
who
buys
the
fur?
does
he
get
any
protection
from
it
at
all
under
the
construction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
he
is
entitled
to
that
under
the
act,
that's
conceded.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
both
--
of
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
of
appeals
take
judicial
knowledge
of
why
it
did
not
keep
those
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
the
evidence
before
congress
showed
there
was
a
difference?
and
they
did
show
that
they
wanted
to
and
that
the
court
ought
not
to
change,
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
what
--
what
objection
the
mandel
offered
to
this?
what
--
what
objection
did
he
have
to
do
in
this,
to
that
fur,
did
they
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said
it
was
not
applicable
to
a
retail
merchant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
the
court
below
hold
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
retail
merchant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
put
in
the
label
to
in
evidence?
did
it
come
in
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
the
labels
i
saw
didn't
state
much
statement.
you
--
you
mean
that's
a
sample
of
blank
label.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
does
contain
all
the
information
you
say
it
should.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
on
their
label?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
state
all
the
information
on
the
label?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
not
an
invoice,
what
would
be
invoice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
retailer
cannot
issue
an
invoice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
--
what
i'm
--
i
might
--
you
say
that
this
fee
were
not
invoice,
isn't
what
i
ask
you
on
--
if
these
are
not
invoices,
how
could
a
retailer
issue
an
invoice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
--
your
position
seems
to
me
to
be
that
the
retailer
can't
do
it.
suppose
i'd
go
into
sales
rulebook
and
buy
it
for
the
argument.
they
write
them
all
down
in
one
thing
and
that
is
to
me
not
--
is
that
an
invoice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
in
your
--
in
your
judgment,
would
that
be
an
invoice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hold
on
--
hold
on
to
invoice
12
different
furs,
put
them
all
down
just
what
they
have
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
judgment,
would
that
be
an
invoice
via
retail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whole
--
wholesales
--
wholesales
over
put
down
on
here
and
i
went
in
and
bought
15
furs
and
put
them
all
down,
put
down
the
price
on
each.
in
your
judgment,
would
that
be
an
invoice
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
not,
what
could
be
an
invoice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
judgment,
are
you
saying
that
a
retailer
cannot
issue
an
invoice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
something
he
does
would
be
an
invoice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
be
then
if
this
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
this.
well,
what
would
be
an
invoice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
judgment,
(voice
overlap)
invoice,
under
the
statute
if
this
is
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe.
if
they're
not
invoices,
how
could
the
retailer
give
an
invoice?
maybe
they
can,
i'm
not
saying
that
--
i
just
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
earlier
stage,
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
a
retailer
doesn't
issue
invoice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
saying
step,
when
the
retailer
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
thinking
of
invoices
given
by
manufactures
or
wholesales.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
use
the
word
"invoice"?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
what
part
of
the
statute
is
that
you
think
states
takes
out
of
retailer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
ways
to
stop
right
then
and
do
you
consider
this
a
commercial
dealing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
are
two
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
imagine
both
of
these
are,
one
of
them
is
trying
to
get
as
cheap
as
it
can,
which
is
--
i'm
afraid
my
recent
experience,
they
--
they
will
not
achieve
and
the
other
is
trying
to
get
as
much
profit
as
they
can
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes
a
consumer
turns
out
to
be
a
seller
himself,
wouldn't
it?
when
installment,
they
come
around.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
get
--
i
couldn't
draw
this
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
do
you
think
needs
protection
the
most,
a
fur
merchant
or
the
individual
that
buys
the
fur
from
the
fur
merchant?
