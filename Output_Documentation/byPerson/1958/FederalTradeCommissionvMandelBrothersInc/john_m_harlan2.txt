is
there
any
difference
between
the
courier
in
the
information
that
goes
on
the
label
and
require
you
to
go
on
the
label
on
that
statute,
or
require
your
to
go
in
the
invoice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
one
question
just
to
get
my
thinking
straight.
your
position,
as
i
understand
is
for
retail
costumer.
he
gets
two
pieces
of
paper,
one,
on
label
and
the
other
on
invoice,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
of
which
contains
the
same
information.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
identity
is
the
same
information
except
the
name
of
the
manufacturer
(inaudible)
on
the
invoice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
argument
to
the
rights
or
wrongs.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
does
your
wife
keep
her
invoice
as
to
the
salesperson
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
collective
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
act
now,
construe
this,
you
would
have
--
you'll
have
to
furnish
a
label
to
the
retailer,
the
same
--
the
same
information
with
the
invoice
as
the
government
says.
we
should
also
appreciate
that.
what
practical
difference
does
it
make,
well
if
you'll
have
to
furnish
two
pieces
of
label?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
still
what
we
have
to
label
on,
the
label
didn't
have
what
you're
reserving
serving
to
a
cease-and-desist
order
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
proceeding
--
better
understanding
the
cease-and-desist
order,
so
i
don't
see
what
the
account
of
furnishing
in
the
business
with
--
(inaudible)
except
that
is
a
laborer
copying
out
from
the
label.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
has
the
commission
been
doing
administrating,
or
in
perspective
(inaudible)
they
have
been
requiring
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
it's
not
your
interest.
justice
john
m.
harlan
construe
it
that
way
themselves.
