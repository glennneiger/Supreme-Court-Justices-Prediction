it
wasn't
a
proper
case

you
keep
copies

justice

c.
clark
you
keep
copies
of
your
labels?
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
wouldn't
the
invoice
set
the
mere
protection
to
you
as
well
as
to
the
public?
you'd
have
a
copy
of
the
invoice,
a
fellow
allowed
to
label,
you
wouldn't
have
a
copy
of
anything.
he
could
say,
“well,
the
saleslady
is
telling
me
it
was
a
tissue
and
it
turns
out
to
be
red.
she
was
playing,
and
you
would
say,
"oh
no,
this
is
not
the
coat,"
or
something
like
that?
well,
if
you
had
an
invoice,
which
--
which
described
on
a
letter,
your
got
in
your
invoice
copy
and
you'd
say,
"well,
here's
the
invoice
copy.
this
shows
what
we
gave
you.
here's
your
signature
on
it."
looks
like
it
protects
you.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
grant
you
a
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
can
you
give
the
address?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
doesn't
that
indicate
that
they
wouldn't
go
along
with
just
their
clerical
errors.
they
would
say,
“well,
mr.
mandel,
you
didn't
have
this
as
a
practice.
this
was
not
your
instructions
to
your
clerk,
to
leave
this
out.
the
clerk
just
(inaudible)
she's
in
a
big
hurry
and
you
get
the
customer
out
of
the
store
and
i'm
thinking
now
then
failed
to
do
it.
she
made
an
error.
she
failed
to
put
down
a
petition.
they
wouldn't
enjoin
a
little
--
a
thing
--
purely
clerical
error,
would
they?
i
mean,
they
were
the
basic
case
on
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
at
least
they
are
instructions
of
the
mandel
brothers
to
their
clerks
rather
than
a
clerical
error
of
the
clerk.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
know,
but
the
filling
in
part,
the
part
that
you
fill
in.
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
you
instruct
them
to
give
paying
all
six?
