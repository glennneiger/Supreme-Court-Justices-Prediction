mr.
samuel
h.
horne
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
to
answer
one
or
two
of
the
questions
at
the
outset,
mr.
justice
black
asked
what
will
mandel
do
about
invoicing.
mandel
gave
invoices.
there
are
some
two
or
three
samples
of
them
in
the
--
in
the
record
at
page
65,
66
--
66
(a)
the
--
the
problem
is
whether
the
statute
specifies
what
has
to
be
on
those
invoices
to
the
retail
consumer,
but
it
--
it
isn't
a
matter
of
resisting,
the
giving
of
--
of
an
invoice.
it's
a
question
of
whether
we
are
at
that
point
subject
to
the
act's
invoicing
requirements.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
that
we
do.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
we're
using
invoice
here.
i
suppose
i
as
a
term
of
art,
we're
talking
about
a
statute
which
requires
invoicing.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
now,
whether
this
is
an
invoice
in
the
retail
trade,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
that,
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that's
the
way
we
--
we
view
it.
it
was
in
this
ftc
proceeding,
treated
as
an
invoice
within
the
act
and
the
complaint
there
didn't
comply.
but
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
that's
right,
it
is.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that
--
that
brings
us
down
to
the
--
to
the
heart
of
the
question.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
whether
in
specifying
the
invoicing,
congress
brought
within
its
scope
these
invoices
that
are
given
at
the
--
at
the
retail
level.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
early
--
early
in
briefing
stages,
as
i
recall,
we
raised
the
point
and
went
on.
but
an
invoice
in
the
common
concept
of
the
term
isn't
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
get
when
you
brought
to
the
counter
and
buy
something
and
get
a
sales
slip.
that
is
used
at
different
stages
of
a
commercial
process.
but
in
this
prosecution,
if
you
turn
the
--
generally,
we
--
we
were
faced
with
the
contention
that
that
sales
slip
is
the
invoice
that
congress
talked
about
and
that
it
didn't
comply
so
we
had
to
make
the
issue
on
that
point.
i
still
adhere
to
my
basic
feeling
that
an
invoice
happens
at
a
different
stage
in
the
commercial
process.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
we
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that
came
to
be
one
of
the
questions
in
the
case
that
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
whether
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
we
had
to
face
up
to
the
issue,
perhaps,
i
should
have
said.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
where
--
well
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
first,
we
denied
that
it
was
an
--
an
invoice
within
the
statute.
furthermore,
we
contended
that
such
invoices
as
had
been
presented
in
the
proceeding
did
comply.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
and
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
it
was
found
that
some
of
them
lacked,
some
of
the
required
--
some
of
the
elements,
some
of
the
representations
that
would
be
required
if
it
were
a
statutory
invoice
within
the
act.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
speaking
of
the
sales
slips
that
are
in
evidence
here.
the
finding
was
that
some
of
them
lacked
one
or
more
of
the
six
required
elements.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
on
the
invoicing
issue,
i
think
that
we
are
concluded
by
the
finding
below
that
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
they
were
--
there
were
omissions.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
first
issue,
whether
those
invoices,
good
or
bad,
or
the
in
--
or
the
invoices
contemplated
by
the
statute,
in
the
private
statute.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
what
would
be
an
invoice?
i
should
say
that
the
term
"in
common
acceptance"
is
used
when
the
manufacturer
ships
a
batch
of
stuff
to
a
wholesaler
or
to
a
retailer.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
technically,
he
can,
but
i'm
saying
that
in
the
common
acceptance
of
the
term
and
whether
congress
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i
--
i'd
have
difficulty
in
saying
how
a
retailer
could
invoice,
i
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
if
we
are
wrong
on
this
first
issue
here,
it
is.
but
i'm
--
i
still
feel
that
in
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
in
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
an
invoice
is
usually
defined
as
a
list
of
goods
sent
together
with
prices
perhaps
from
one
person
to
another.
well,
that's
a
--
that's
a
broad
general
term.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
to
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
an
invoice
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
one
thing
and
an
invoice
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
--
at
large
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i
don't
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i
don't
believe
we
can
say
that.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
this
technically
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
technically,
this
may
be
an
invoice
at
large.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
technically,
this
may
be,
speaking
at
large
and
apart
from
the
statute,
these
sales
slips
may
be
invoices
too.
but
the
question
is
whether
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
i
--
my
difficulty
is
in
getting
away
from
the
strong
feeling
that
in
--
in
the
common
acceptance
of
the
term,
an
invoice
is
an
earlier
stage
of
the
process.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
prior
to
the
retailers'
handling.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
not
in
the
common
acceptance
of
the
term,
but
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
with
all
respect
that
that's
going
to
--
to
get
us
anywhere
because
we've
got
a
definition
of
invoice
here.
and
the
question
is
whether
what
they
did
was
within
--
or
whether
that
step
--
step
of
the
process
is
within
the
statutory
definition
of
invoice.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
does
the
--
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i
think
that's
--
that
is
certainly
the
common
acceptance
of
the
term
and
that
is
the
way
we
view
the
requirements.
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
perhaps
we'd
have
to
call
that
a
non-statutory
invoice,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
of
course.
the
--
the
obstacle
in
many
of
these
considerations
is
the
limited
nature
of
the
statutory
definition.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
two
parts,
your
honor,
which
is
issued
in
connection
with
any
commercial
dealing
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
the
sale
from
the
--
from
mandel
to
--
to
the
customer?
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
it
seems
to
me
that
dealing
imports
two
people.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
and
dealing
commercially
imports
trafficking
in
goods
with
a
view
to
resale
or
exchange
as
a
business.
and
unless
you
have
on
both
sides
of
your
transaction,
your
retailer
and
your
--
your
customer
if
the
customer
is
buying
to
sell
to
someone
else,
that's
one
thing
but
if
--
that
is
not
the
ordinary
situation.
that
imports,
it
seems
to
me,
that
first
commercial
clause,
the
necessity
of
their
being
of
persons
on
each
side
of
the
transaction
that
are
trafficking
for
gain,
dealing
commercially
then
now,
the
second
clause
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i
suspect
in
this
situation
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
may
i
--
continue
to
answer
your
question
first,
please?
the
other
clause
in
the
definition
and
the
--
the
one
that's
been
more
talked
about
is
purchaser,
consignee
and
so
on,
or
any
other
person
who
is
engaged
in
dealing
commercially
in
fur
product
or
furs.
now,
that's
a
big
mouthful.
i
think
it
might
help
get
that
picture
if
we
say
transported
or
delivered
to
a
purchaser
and
so
on,
or
any
other
commercially
dealing
person.
to
shorten
the
--
the
--
who
is
dealing?
that
clearly,
it
seems
to
us,
requires
that
the
transferee
in
the
process,
the
recipient
of
the
statutory
invoice,
be
a
person
who
is
dealing
commercially,
the
court
of
appeals
took
both
clauses,
one
as
reinforcing
the
other.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
either
clause
would
exclude
from
the
purview
of
invoice
as
defined
in
the
act
and
that
fall
from
the
invoice
in
the
requirements,
the
retail
sale
to
the
consumer.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that
sometimes
is
the
case.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
if
you
have
--
if
you
simply
draw
the
line
that
--
the
invoicing
requirements
follow
the
product
down
to
the
hands
of
the
retailer
and
from
thereon,
the
protection
is
in
the
label,
i
think
there's
more
difficulty.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
these
congressional
hearings
suggesting
that
the
consumer
needs
information,
needs
facts,
needs
to
avoid
the
glamorized
description
of
fur
product
that
seems
to
have
been
pervading
the
fur
industry.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
reports
or
in
the
legislative
history.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case.
there
is
one
sidelight
in
which
--
which
maybe
at
some
interest
to
you
in
the
legislative
history
and
neither
is
this.
the
--
the
term
"dealing
commercially"
was
used
at
another
point,
in
an
earlier
stage
of
the
--
the
bill
to
designate
--
it
--
they
said
in
section
3
(d)
of
h.r.
3734
as
reported
in
the
80th
congress.
that
a
person
dealing
commercially,
if
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
label
has
come
to
him
as
wrong,
may
substitute
another
label.
that's
the
only
other
place
in
the
history
that
i
found
dealing
commercially
is
used.
obviously
there,
it
has
to
mean
the
wholesaler,
the
jobber,
the
retailer,
because
they're
the
only
ones
that
are
interested
in
looking
at
the
label
and
substituting
or
correcting
it.
the
consumer
certainly
is
not
interested
in
substituting
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
certainly.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
from
a
practical
standpoint
and
i'm
speculating
now,
i
must
admit
this
isn't
in
the
record.
was
--
it
wasn't
raised.
from
the
practical
standpoint,
the
fur
buyer,
the
head
of
the
department
can,
before
they
open
the
door,
go
down
to
the
line
of
garments
and
police
the
tags,
and
make
certain
that
all
of
the
tags
or
labels
of
--
are
in
proper
order.
when
the
door
is
opened
and
the
sale
starts,
and
they
have
two
or
three
dozen
salesclerks
to
--
selling
the
products,
it
becomes
a
different
matter
watching
every
say
--
it's
just
--
it's
physically
impossible
to
watch
every
sales
slip
that
each
clerk
makes
out
to
make
certain
that
it
touches
on
each
of
the
six
statutory
elements.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
there,
it's
more
than
the
physical
effort
of
copying.
it's
a
matter
of
checking
to
make
certain
that
each
clerk
has
copied
correctly
and
that
isn't
always
feasible.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
we
are
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
not
of
the
labels,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
they
do.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
it
might.
but
on
the
other
hand
--
well,
i
would
suggest
that
that
gets
into
an
area
in
which
the
federal
trade
commission
has
no
function.
that's
the
local
controversy
in
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
--
the
fur
products
labeling
act
is
a
disclosure
act,
and
the
federal
trade
commission
polices
the
disclosure,
the
completeness
of
the
disclosure
all
through
process.
but
if
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
if
a
controversy
arises
at
--
at
the
local
level
as
in
a
merchant
and
his
customer,
it's
going
to
be
answered
by
the
store's
practices.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
are
objecting
at
this
point
because
if
there's
a
cease-and-desist
order
on
us,
we
are
exposed
to
future
contempt
or
penalty
proceedings
if
somebody
makes
another
mistake.
and
the
lesser
of
that
exposure
we
have,
the
happier
the
store
will
be.
that
isn't
to
say
that
there
hasn't
been
--
there
--
i'm
told
that
there
has
been
a
radical
revision
of
all
their
procedures,
i
mentioned
we
made
at
the
advertising.
that's
all
been
changed.
that's
in
the
cease-and-desist
order,
and
their
other
procedures
have
been
radically
changed
to
try
to
bring
them
in
the
line,
but
there
are
limits
to
how
far
you
can
go
with
personnel
and
how
much
you
can
get
out
off
them.
now,
you
--
someone
asked
me
a
question
a
moment
ago
whether
we'd
be
prosecuted
for
typographical
error.
one
of
the
elements
on
--
on
the
invoice
in
which
we
were
found
deficient
is
that
the
sales
slip
says
mandel
brothers
and
doesn't
say
--
the
state
of
madison
to
chicago,
illinois.
the
store
had
been
there
for
more
than
50
years
and
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
and
--
we
can
give
the
address.
an
attempt
was
made
but
the
commission
didn't
go
along
with
it,
speaking
of
technicalities.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
the
labels
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
again,
all
i
can
say
is
they
did.
that
was
while
the
deficiencies
pointed
out.
i
know
the
deficiencies
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
no,
they
say
of
--
as
a
printed
form,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
certainly,
but
we
can
instruct
all
day
long
and
hope
that
the
clerk
will
grasp
it
and
we'll
fill
in
all
the
required
elements.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that
isn't
in
the
record.
i
assume
that
they
have.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
oh
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
here's
what
happened.
the
investigator
from
the
federal
trade
commission
came
in,
in
september
of
1952,
one
month
after
the
act
became
effective
to
look
over
what
they
were
doing.
mandel
brothers
was
there
as
it
had
been,
previously,
giving
these
sales
slips,
such
as
are
set
forth
in
the
record
here.
there
are
fifteen
or
twenty
of
those
things
in
--
in
the
record
below.
the
investigator
went
through
the
books
and
took
samples
of
the
sales
slips,
which
they
had
been
given
--
giving
and
checked
them
to
see
if
they
were
in
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
that
new
act.
he
looked
at
the
labels
on
the
fur
garments,
checked
them
to
see
if
they
were
in
conformity
with
the
new
requirements.
he
found
some
mistakes.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
the
act
gone
into
effect
in
--
in
august
of
1952
and
if
i
remember
correctly,
the
investigator
was
there
in
september
of
1952.
he
came
back
in
october
of
1954
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
--
for
another
inspection.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
and
for
whatever
its
worth,
he
found
a
great
many
fewer
errors
at
the
1954
inspection.
and
furthermore,
for
whatever
it's
worth,
he
--
it's
in
the
record.
he
says
nothing
--
there
was
no
communication
after
the
first
inspection
as
to
what
--
whether
they
were
doing
anything
wrong
or
what
they
were
doing
wrong.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
our
position
is
that
irrespective
of
whether
these
sales
slips
were
within
or
without
the
--
whether
they
did
or
did
not
have
all
six
elements.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that
that
isn't
--
the
question
here
--
the
question
--
our
position
is
that
whether
they
did
or
didn't,
it
was
gratuitous
so
far
as
the
act
is
concerned,
the
giving
of
this.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
act.
the
act
doesn't
say
that
the
retailer
has
to
give
the
invoice.
the
act
requires
invoicing
of
furs
from
the
raw
pelt
down
to
manufacturer.
the
act
requires
the
labeling
of
fur
products
from
the
time
they
are
manufactured
until
they
reach
the
end
to
the
consumer.
in
addition,
there
is
this
further
requirement,
which
is
the
issue
before
us.
it
says
"invoice
fur
product."
now,
the
extent
of
that
requirement,
of
invoicing
fur
product,
whether
or
not
these
invoices
we
gave
were
good
or
bad.
the
extent
of
that
requirement
of
invoicing
fur
products
is
--
is
the
question
here
and
that
depends
on
what
the
definition
means.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
if
he
doesn't
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
our
position
is
that
the
law
does
not
extend
to
requiring
a
statutorily
detailed
invoice
from
the
retailer
to
the
consumer.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
no
--
no,
your
honor.
it
will
require
--
the
only
requirement
of
an
invoice
is
the
statutorily
detailed
invoice.
there's
no
other
involved.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
in
the
statute.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
if
we
don't
have
to
comply,
no,
your
honor.
but
we
had
to
file
both
steps
in
the
case.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
we
have
only
the
one
step
here.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
that's
true,
and
i
think
that
in
--
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
we
can't
deny
that
there
was
a
finding
and
--
unreversed
finding
that
some
of
them
were
not
included
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
--
if
they
are
subject
to
the
statutory
requirement
of
invoices.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
but
our
position
is
that
your
retailer
to
the
consumer
transaction
has
its
complete
and
adequate
protection
in
the
requirement
of
a
label.
the
label
has
the
same
information,
the
commission
itself
in
its
opinion
twice,
said,
the
clerk
can
copy
from
the
--
from
the
label
on
the
invoice.
and
as
--
as
a
further
point,
said
that
the
--
the
information
required
for
the
invoice
is
the
same
that's
required
for
the
label.
there's
no
--
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
it's
a
duplication.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
and
--
and
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
--
we
--
our
position
is
that
the
label
is
the
thing
that
reaches
the
consumer
and
it
has
to
be
on
the
garment,
on
--
when
she
examines
it
or
if
she
considers
it
and
it
has
to
stay
on
the
garment
until
it's
delivered
into
her
hands.
but
your
invoice,
what
good
does
it
do?
it
doesn't
--
except
to
--
for
local
bookkeeping
reasons.
it's
prepared
after
your
sale
has
been
consummated.
she
doesn't
see
that
until
after
she
--
she
takes
the
fur
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
--
coat
home
and
unpacks
it.
and
as
to
the
suggesting
that
they
may
lose
or
throw
away
the
tag,
i
think
it
imputes
absurdity
federal
legislation
to
say
that
it
requires
giving
a
consumer
the
same
information
on
each
of
two
pieces
of
paper,
of
course
you'd
like
to
lose
one.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
the
commission
is
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i
do
know.
they
have
been
after
practically
every
fur
dealer
in
the
country,
on
and
--
on
the
whole
thing.
we
--
we
can't
decide
the
basic.
that
they
think
the
position
that's
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
--
we
don't
feel
that
it
--
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
that
issue
has
been
litigated.
we
don't
feel
that's
a
long
embedded
practice.
moreover,
the
thing
was
before
congress
through
three
sessions.
the
commission
wrote
six
letters
of
comment
to
the
congressional
committees
describing
the
bill.
and
in
every
case,
the
commission
said
“just
two
requirement.”
so
the
bill
required
invoice
first
and
label
fur
product.
they
never
mentioned
this
other
--
in
any
of
the
letters.
so
that
that
fur
--
that
interpretation
apparently
was
established
after
the
act
got
into
the
hands
of
commission
for
administration.
there's
just
one
other
feature
of
the
legislative
history
i
would
like
to
touch
on
briefly.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
i
am
glad
to
have
to
have
the
question
because
it
indicates
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
for
one
thing
on
the
--
the
invoicing
question,
it
depends
altogether
on
the
interpretation
of
this
term
"invoice".
i
--
short
--
i
used
a
shorthand
reference
to
it
a
moment
ago
or
--
or
other
commercially
dealing
person,
purchaser,
consignee,
factor,
bailee
or
other
commercially
dealing
person.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
just
briefly
the
parallel
between
the
language,
that
language
and
the
language
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
united
states
versus
standard
brewery,
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
the
statute
prohibited
use
of
food
products
in
the
manufacture
or
production
of
beer,
wine,
or
other
intoxicating
liquor.
and
the
court
held
that
--
or
other
intoxicating
liquor
referred
back
and
modified
beer
and
wine
and
it
had
to
be
intoxicating
beer
before
it
was
in
that
prohibition.
similarly,
we
say
that
this
clause,
commercially
dealing
person,
goes
back
and
modifies
that
--
enumeration
of
the
persons
who
are
concerned
with
the
handling
of
furs.
now,
you'll
want
to
know,
i
think,
why
we
say
that
it's
reasonable
that
congress
should
have
required
the
invoicing
of
fur
products
from
the
manufacturer
to
the
retailer
and
not
require
it
from
the
retailer
to
the
--
to
the
consumer.
the
reason
for
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
found
in
the
fact
that
you're
intervening
persons,
your
wholesaler,
your
jobber
or
your
retailer.
each
one
is
responsible
for
seeing
that
the
garment
has
a
proper
label
on
it
before
it
goes
forward
from
him.
if
the
wholesaler,
the
jobber,
the
retailer
has
a
statutory
invoice,
a
statutorily
detailed
invoice,
he
has
something
against
which
he
can
check
the
correctness
of
the
invoice,
of
the
label
for
which
he
is
responsible.
but
the
consumer
doesn't
have
any
responsibility
to
pass
--
pass
it
on
to
anybody.
and
the
consumer
had
--
does
have
the
full
protection
of
the
required
statutory
label.
there
was
a
mention
of
the
testimony
in
the
hearings
in
the
80th
congress,
where
this
whole
legislation
originated,
the
fur
dealers
and
processors
and
manufacturers
were
about
the
only
witnesses
that
were
in
there,
except
to
--
to
irrelevant
groups
that
were
barred.
they
were
opposing
the
legislation.
they
were
opposing
any
legislation.
they
were
opposing
labeling.
when
they
advocated
invoicing
to
be
observed,
they
didn't
advocate
invoicing
but
we
touched
them.
they
advocated
invoicing
by
somebody
else.
the
--
at
the
outset
of
those
hearings,
i
have
been
testimony
by
a
representative
from
the
federal
trade
commission
who
had
recommended
labeling
as
the
remedy
for
the
bills
of
the
business.
at
the
close
of
those
hearings
and
how
it's
in
the
80th,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
congressman
o'hara,
called
as
if
--
he's
the
representative,
if
i
could
stand
and
ask
if
he
could
add
anything
to
testimony.
he
reaffirmed
his
previous
advocacy
of
labeling
then
he
turned
to
the
suggestion
of
invoicing
as
being
--
as
against
labeling.
and
he
said,
“labeling
would
be
a
more
effective
remedy
than
invoicing
because
the
label
gives
the
customer
facts
before
the
--
before
she
makes
her
choice.
the
invoice
comes
after."
then
he
said
it
would
be
like
locking
the
barn
door
after
the
horse
is
stolen.
he
also
went
on
the
comment,
"there
is
no
burden
on
the
manufacturer's
invoice,
but
there
is
a
burden
on
the
retailer
to
give
an
invoice
at
the
time
to
every
sale."
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
well,
what
they
suggest
would
be
an
improvement
on
what
the
commission
did,
but
it
would
still
leave
us
in
the
position
where
we're
subject
to
a
cease-and-desist
order,
and
if
we
do
violate,
it
will
be
a
penalty
the
first
time
and
not
the
second
time
until
your
cease-and-desist
order
put
you
--
says
that
you
will
--
mr.
samuel
h.
horne
if
we
--
if
one
of
the
three
respects
in
which
we
--
we
were
exonerated.
i
thank
you.
