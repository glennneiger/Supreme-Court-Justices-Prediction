i
--
i
don't
get
this
“permanent,”
why
--
what's
--
why
the
emphasis
on
“permanent,”
mr.
friedman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
a
permanent
in
the
sense
you
mean
that
it's
saved
somehow
by
the
purchaser?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
--
i
gather
--
i
don't
see
why
the
--
there'd
be
anymore
disposition
to
save
permanently
an
invoice
than
there
would
be
to
save
a
tag
containing
the
same
information.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
have
difficulty
from
personal
experience
understanding
that
there's
a
preference
for
saving
invoices.
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
so
in
my
household.[laughs]

j.
brennan,

she
tends
to
keep?

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
something
peculiar
to
the
purchase
of
furs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
were
their
qualifications?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
an
ordinary
sales
slip.
justice

j.
brennan,

just
the
ordinary
sales
slip.
