justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on,
may
i
ask
whether
this
woman
goes
into
a
fur
shop
and
buy
the
fur
and
she
gets
slippers,
is
that
an
invoice
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
--
the
usual
thing
that's
rolled
off
a
cash
register?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
invoice
within
--
under
your
submission,
that's
an
invoice
within
the
terms
of
this
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
the
statute
does
require
an
invoice
because
in
section
5
(b)
it
states
at
page
39
of
our
brief
that
a
fur
product
shall
be
considered
to
be
falsely
or
deceptively
invoiced
if
such
fur
product
or
fur
is
not
invoiced
to
show.
we
believe
this
is
a
mandatory
requirement
of
invoicing.
the
statute
in
section
3
deals
with
misbranding,
false
invoicing
and
false
advertising
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
do
that,
let
me
clear
up
one
more
doubt
in
my
mind.
if
furs
were
shipped
from
chicago
to
washington
with
tags
or
label,
whatever
label
may
require,
and
sold
to
a
local
buyer
in
washington,
to
the
district,
i
suppose
it's
certainly
arguable
that
that
sale
of
that
piece
of
fur
sent
without
tags
in
chicago
to
a
--
i
withdraw
to
the
district
(inaudible)
from
chicago
to
new
york
and
take
away
the
problem
of
the
district.
furs
were
shipped
from
chicago
to
new
york
for
sale
by
retail
merchant
in
new
york,
and
that
fur
is
bought
by
a
woman
in
new
york.
i
suppose
it's
certainly
arguable,
i'm
not
clear
about
it
that
the
--
assuming
there's
a
violation
of
the
statute
in
that
misbrand
of
tag,
the
sale
in
new
york
would
still
subject
the
--
the
shipper
from
chicago
to
the
prohibitions
of
the
act,
and
--
and
if
their
commerce
would
not
have
been
exhausted
in
that
point,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
however,
in
also
the
invoice
which
the
retail
dealer
in
new
york
gives
to
the
woman
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
a
piece
of
fur
sold
by
whoever
sales
crime
lord
pulls
the
furs
to
new
york
to
a
mrs.
jordans.
and
he
gives
him
a
cash
slip,
that's
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
suppose
the
pelt
--
as
the
woman
buys
a
pelt
in
order
to
have
it
made
by
some
other
maker
or
tailor,
whatever
it
is,
whatever
you
call
it.
is
that
piece
of
paper
also
within
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fur
--
the
--
the
misbranding
of
the
piece
of
fur
which
has
reached
new
york
from
chicago
would
be
within
(voice
overlap)
within
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
thing,
but
would
the
sale
of
that
piece
of
pelt
in
a
cert
of
saying
it
costs
$673
and
indicating
(inaudible)
or
whatever
it
is,
(inaudible),
whatever
it
is.
would
that
--
would
that
piece
of
paper
be
within
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
give
the
--
all
of
that
facts
there
what
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mine
is
--
my
--
my
hypothesis
of
the
shipment
in
--
in
interstate
commerce,
no
doubt
about
that.
but
the
sale
of
a
particular
piece
of
pelt
is
--
is
what
normally
would
be
deemed
a
local
transaction.
now,
i
want
to
know
whether
the
execution
of
that
intrastate
shipment
when
it
gets
into
the
hand
of
an
individual
customer
is
within
--
deemed
to
be
within
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
also
the
misbranded
label,
was
that
not
even
in
the
act,
although
the
misbranded
label
comes
from
chicago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
finished
coat,
finished
jacket
or
whatever
you
call
it,
the
finished
piece
of
fur,
ready
to
wear,
sent
from
chicago
to
new
york.
if
sold
in
the
conditions
which
it
had
been
transported
with
a
misbranded
label,
would
subject
who,
the
manufacturer
or
the
seller?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
piece
of
paper
by
which
is
requisite
what
it
cost,
designating
what
the
nature
of
the
fur
is,
would
not
be
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
--
what
was
the
fact
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
compared
to
--
where
did
the
fur
--
what
was
it,
a
fur
product
or
a
fur
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
piece
of
fur
to
wear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
way
around.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
invoice
is
more
permanent
than
the
tag?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
believe
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that
the
--
the
retailer
would
keep
invoice
to
--
from
his
manufacturer,
but
the
ultimate
consumer
keeps
invoice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
top
of
my
knowledge,
a
women
is
very
limited
to
make
those.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
addition
to
that,
she
is
required
to
be
given
this
invoice
which
contains
this
important
information
which
congress
thought
consumers
of
fur
product
should
have.
she
gets
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that
this
tag
isn't
the
ordinary
label
that
is
put
on,
piece
of
the
clothing?
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
heard
you
say
that,
but
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
this
case,
i'm
talking
about
generally
on
the
labels
in
the
--
in
the
normal
colloquial
sense
of
the
term
sewn
unto
the
furs
that
people
buy,
that
women
buy?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
don't
believe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
if
she
gets
that
information
on
a
piece
of
paper,
she
carefully
puts
it
away.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
hope
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
take
judicial
knowledge
as
they
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
evidence,
in
any
report
or
in
the
spokesman
of
the
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
by
congressmen
or
witnesses
in
hearings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
wanted
this
statute
to
be
--
must
be
a
noble
industry.
i
must
say
they
wanted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
will
also
have
the
price?
this
is
what
you
call
the
label.
does
that
have
the
price
of
the
fur?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
at
--
as
industry
practice,
doesn't
the
label
have
the
price?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
may
i
ask
one
more
question.
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
so-called
invoice,
when
i
say
so-called,
not
in
an
invidious
way,
this
technical
invoice
was
stated
things
falsely,
just
didn't
state
what
was
required
by
--
under
your
views
of
the
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
a
case
where
an
invoice
misrepresented.
it
didn't
make
the
representations,
which
according
to
your
views
are
affirmatively
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
that.
i
just
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
my
mind,
there
might
be
a
difference
where
a
piece
of
paper
is
given
which
--
which
misrepresents,
is
underrepresented,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
failed
to
represent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
this
is
just
an
order
so
that
we're
not
bothered
here
where
the
mens
rea
is
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
the
real
question
whether,
although
it
is
an
ordinary
sales
slip
thing,
you
and
i
or
--
or
i
and
my
ignorance,
my
--
my
extreme
of
calling
it
an
invoice,
congress
is
entitled
to
give
invoice
defined
--
limit
beyond
the
colloquial
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
is
whether
it
has
done
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
you
have
to
meet
the
issue,
other
than
saying
it
isn't
an
invoice
in
the
terms
of
the
statute.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
how
did
you
--
how
do
you
meet
it
except
in
that
way?
you
mean
allege
you
did
--
you
don't
meet
it
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
satisfy
the
requirement
if
this
be
an
invoice,
did
it?
it
did
not
satisfy
the
requirement.
if
this
be
a
statutory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
why
invoice,
it
didn't
satisfy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
you
had
to
meet
the
issue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
was
--
how
do
you
face
up
to
it
except
by
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
not
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
was
searching
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
be
clear
about
this.
there
was
--
this
is
a
piece
of
paper,
it
contains
certain
writings,
certain
information.
if
you
were
to
agree
that
you
do
not,
that
the
statute
required
you
for
this
transaction
to
comply
with
the
statute,
did
it
contain
the
information
that
the
statute
command
be
contained
in
such
a
piece
of
paper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
if
you
--
if
you
are
required
to
include
those
elements,
then
the
commission
has
a
right
to
issue
this
into
this
order,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
i
go
back
to
my
question.
are
you
contending
that
even
though
this
be
considered
an
invoice
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
you
comply
with
what
was
required?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
omissions
--
there
were
omissions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
