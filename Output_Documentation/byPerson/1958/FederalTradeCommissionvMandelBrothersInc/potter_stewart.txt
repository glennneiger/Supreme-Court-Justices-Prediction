well,
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
purpose
of
the
act
to
see
to
it
that
a
consumer
is
fully
and
honestly
informed
of
what
she's
buying
at
the
time
she
buys
it.
isn't
that
its
fundamental
purpose?
justice

stewart
now
mr.
friedman
then,
is
it
--
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
the
material
set
out
on
--
in
your
brief
in
which
invoices
are
so
highly
allotted
by
representatives
of
the
industry.
the
fact
is
that
they
were
proposing
invoices
instead
of
labels,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
they
weren't
comparing
invoices
to
labels.
they
wished
--
they
--
they
were
opposing
labels,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
was
sufficient?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
agree
with
your
fundamental
and
primary
contention
that
these
were
not
invoices
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
is
that
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
issue
here
on
that
--
on
that
part
of
the
case,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
horne,
on
the
second
aspect
of
this
case,
are
you
and
the
government
now
on
agreement
as
to
the
form
of
the
order?
justice
potter
stewart
you'd
be
violating
one
of
the
three
respects
in
which
you
have
--
have
been
talking.
