ms.

g.
forer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
we
protested
the
proposed
diversion
of
great
lakes'
water
by
the
elmhurst-villa
park-lombard
water
commission
because
as
we
stated
in
our
letter
which
is
attached
to
the
complaint,
the
diversion
added
the
great
lakes
and
the
basin
and
into
another
watershed
would
constitute
an
infringement
of
the
rights
of
pennsylvania
as
a
riparian
sovereign.
the
lowering
of
the
levels
of
lake
erie
constitutes
immeasurable
damage
to
pennsylvania.
but
beyond
this
very
real
question
of
damages
pennsylvania
is
concerned
with
the
theory
of
law
upon
which
this
proposed
diversion
is
predicated.
a
theory
of
far
reaching
implications,
we
believe
startling
and
without
precedent.
and
mr.
justice
brennan
observed
yesterday,
if
this
corporation
is
entitled
to
take
and
divert
great
lakes
water
then
a
precedent
is
established
for
innumerable
users
and
commercial
suppliers
of
water
in
the
united
states
and
canada
to
divert
without
control
or
limitation.
the
complaint
seeks
to
restrain
the
defendant
state
but
it
places
no
limitation
on
the
plaintiffs.
there
were
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
that
is
right.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
we
are
concerned
--
first,
if
you
have
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
this.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
thank
you.
several
matters
were
discussed
yesterday
namely
that
there
was
no
other
community
interested
in
taking
great
lakes'
waters.
and
we
have
information
from
published
newspaper
accounts
that
other
illinois
community
such
as
arlington,
barrington
and
mt.
prospect
are
at
this
very
moment
considering
going
to
lake
michigan
for
water.
in
addition
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
they
are
not
riparian
and
most
of
them
i
believe
are
outside
of
the
watershed,
as
is
this
complex
of
communities.
they
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
in
illinois,
but
not
riparian
and
not
within
the
great
lakes
watershed.
in
addition
some
question
was
raised
yesterday
with
respect
to
canada's
position.
now
of
course
obviously
canada
is
not
before
this
court.
but
we
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
letter
of
april
9th,
1959
from
the
canadian
embassy
to
the
united
states
and
if
i
may
i
would
quote
this
just
as
one
sentence.
every
diversion
of
water
within
great
lakes
watershed
at
chicago
inevitably
decreases
the
volume
of
water
remaining
in
the
basin
for
all
purposes.
the
government
of
canada
is
opposed
to
any
action
which
will
have
the
effect
of
reducing
the
volume
of
water
in
the
great
lakes
basin.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
this
--
i
am
reading
from
the
house
of
commons
debate,
volume
103,
number
59,
the
second
session,
24th
parliament,
official
report
dated
thursday
april
16th,
1959.
in
cases
such
as
this
involving
natural
resources,
one
who
objects
to
a
taking
or
a
wasting
of
a
resource
is
always
placed
in
a
dilemma
articulated
in
the
old
english
chancery
case
of
goldsmith
against
tunbridge
wells
improvement
commission.
either,
we
are
accused
object
--
objecting
too
early
or
because
the
taking
or
wasting
is
of
a
small
amount
or
waiting
too
late
until
we
are
faced
with
a
(inaudible)
plea,
as
we
were
in
the
chicago
sanitary
district
case
which,
of
course,
you
are
all
very
familiar.
the
applicable
law
to
this
taking
as
we
view
it
is
well
settled.
all
of
the
great
lakes
states
including
illinois
and
also
canada
adhere
to
the
riparian
doctrine
of
water
law.
this
commission
is
an
illinois
corporation
authorized
to
sell
water
to
communities
and
industries,
and
there
are
plans
for
further
expansion
of
the
industries
in
this
area.
it
is
undisputed
that
these
are
none
riparian
users
and
indeed
are
outside
of
the
great
lakes
watershed.
whether
they
are
20
miles
from
the
great
lakes
or
200
miles
is
in
our
opinion
wholly
irrelevant
because
if
the
state
of
illinois
can
come
in
and
claim
that
a
non-riparian
has
a
right
to
take
and
divert,
then
they
make
their
claim
with
respect
to
any
community
within
the
entire
state.
thus
we
say
any
analogy
to
what
is
being
done
in
milwaukee,
cleveland,
and
chicago
which
are
riparian
municipalities
entitled
to
use
great
lakes
water
is
implicit.
all
of
the
riparian
communities
along
the
great
lakes
with
which
are
familiar
use
that
water
and
return
it
to
the
basin
in
accordance
with
riparian
law
of
reasonable
use,
all
except
chicago
of
course.
this
corporation,
the
elmhurst-villa
park-lombard
commission
asserts
a
unilateral
right
as
a
non-riparian
outside
the
watershed
to
take
an
unlimited
quantity
of
interstate
and
international
waters
without
regulation
by
any
governmental
agency
and
without
the
consent
of
the
riparian
sovereigns.
while
illinois
asserts
that
the
amount
of
water
to
be
taken
is
relatively
small,
the
complaint
itself
seeks
an
unlimited
right
to
take
without
any
interference.
in
seeking
to
negotiate
with
illinois,
the
thrust
of
the
defendant
states
has
been
to
require
a
return
of
the
effluent
which
would
constitute
about
93%
of
the
water
taken.
but
while
seeking
such
a
return
of
that
purified
effluent
will
substantially
reduce
the
damages,
the
right
to
take
water
at
all
is
hereby
challenged.
the
plaintiff's
justification
for
taking,
as
alleged
in
paragraph
3
of
the
complaint
is
the
urgent
need
of
these
communities.
mr.
bane
in
his
argument
adverted
at
some
length
to
the
engineering
studies
upon
which
the
plan
for
this
taking
was
based
and
this
study
is
mentioned
in
paragraph
9
of
the
complaint
although
of
course
it
is
not
in
evidence.
but
like
the
affidavits,
i
attached
to
the
motion
to
advance.
this
engineering
study
does
not
bear
scrutiny.
it
sets
forth
exports
two
reasons
for
the
plan
on
page
13.
one
is
that
the
use
of
lake
water
instead
of
well
water
which
save
each
household
$16
a
year
for
soap.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
why
these
communities
did
not
choose
to
purchase
water
from
the
sanitary
district.
and
in
answering
that
question,
mr.
bane
again
referred
to
the
engineering
report
and
stated
that
this
was
the
recommendation
of
the
engineers
and
of
course
this
is
true.
but
the
reason
for
this
recommendation
is
very
interesting.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
read
just
one
sentence
there,
one
paragraph.
two
practical
methods
of
obtaining
lake
michigan
water
are
available
to
the
commission.
they
are:
one,
negotiation
for
purchase
of
filtered
water
from
the
city
of
chicago,
or
two,
construction
and
operation
of
new
supply
and
treatment
facilities
to
be
owned
and
operated
by
the
commission.
a
course
analysis
of
the
alternate
methods
indicates
that
the
estimated
unit
course
for
filtered
lake
michigan
water
will
be
less
if
the
commission
builds
and
operates
its
own
independent
system.
this
is
the
need
of
which
has
been
asserted.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
our
objection
might
be
different.
we
say
that
the
sanitary
district
is
a
riparian
authority
which
has
the
right
and
power
to
use
lake
michigan
water.
since
the
taking
of
water
by
the
sanitary
district
is
subject
to
the
opening
decree
of
this
court
we
feel
that
we
as
defendant
states
would
not
be
harmed
by
any
additional
servicing
of
other
communities
since
any
diversion
of
the
water
would
be
subject
to
the
control
of
this
court.
and
therefore
we
say
that
any
taking
additional
taking
must
of
course
be
considered
in
original
cases
two,
three,
and
four
before
this
court
to
determine
to
what
extent
any
diversion
at
all
out
of
the
lakes
is
permissible
and
to
what
extent
it
damages
all
of
us
as
defendant
states.
this
would
not
involve
a
new
principle
of
law
that
a
non-riparian
community
could
simply
purchase
one
--
my
new
portion
of
land
along
the
lake
and
put
in
a
pumping
station
and
divert
waters
down
the
state
uninterruptedly.
if
the
metropolitan
sanitary
district
does
it,
we
say
it
is
subject
to
the
control
of
this
court
entirely.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
we
think
it
would
make
a
considerable
difference.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
if
the
border
is
purchased
from
the
sanitary
district,
we
claim
that
the
sanitary
district
is
required
to
return
the
purified
effluent
to
the
great
lakes
basin.
this
water
commission,
this
corporation
is
established
to
sell
water
to
pump
and
supply
and
sell
water.
it
has
no
authority
according
to
illinois
to
purify
the
sewage
and
to
return
it.
the
plan
of
this
corporation
is
to
take
the
water
from
the
great
lakes,
take
it
over
the
watershed,
service
these
communities
and
industries
at
a
profit
or
a
certainly
charging
for
it,
and
then
simply
let
gravity
and
nature
take
its
scores
and
the
water
will
be
--
go
down
the
mississippi
waterway.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
we
have
heard
at
great
length
that
only
a
small
amount
of
water
is
involved.under
the
decree
of
this
court,
the
sanitary
district
is
taking
1500
cubic
feet
per
second
for
the
purpose
of
flushing
out
the
canal.
in
addition,
they
are
taking
an
unlimited
quantity
as
domestic
pumpage.
and
according
to
the
figures
of
the
sanitary
district
this
is
some
1700
cubic
feet
per
second.
totalled
together,
this
constitutes
more
water
then
flows
through
the
delaware
river,
so
we
are
not
talking
about
small
amounts.
and
as
i
say,
if
this
amount
of
water
is
added,
every
other
community
may
also
add
and
we
see
it
is
a
very
serious
question.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
no.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
we
claim
and
that
will
be
decided
in
the
other
case.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
that
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
they
are
required
to.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
yes.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
that's
right.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
we
believe
that
that
is
the
law
and
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
which
was
discussed
at
some
length
yesterday
has
in
effect
been
misconstrued
or
misapplied.
if
we
turn
to
those
cases
in
which
a
non-riparian
community
was
allowed
to
take
waters,
we
find
that
it
was
not
a
case
in
which
a
non-riparian
having
no
right
to
the
waters
simply
was
granted
a
division
of
these
waters
because
it
needed
water.
there
was
in
effect
a
quid
pro
quo.
now,
in
the
case
of
connecticut
against
massachusetts
which
was
quite
different,
we
work
--
the
court
was
concerned
with
two
wholly
intrastate
non-navigable
rivers.
massachusetts,
under
a
permit
from
the
secretary
of
the
army
captured
a
limited
amount
of
flood
waters
and
the
amount
was
limited
by
the
permit.
flood
waters
within
the
state
and
withheld
them
from
going
down
into
connecticut.
connecticut
protested
on
the
ground
that
it
was
losing
a
power
potential.
now
of
course,
there
were
no
laws
to
navigation
because
these
were
non-navigable
streams
whereas
of
course
we
are
contending
that
any
loss
to
the
great
lakes
very
seriously
affects
navigation,
the
ports,
and
the
shipping
as
general
reynolds
pointed
out.
the
loss
of
power
potential
was
not
deemed
adequate
grounds
for
damage
because
connecticut
not
only
had
--
had
no
power
installations
but
had
no
plans
for
any.
now,
as
we
all
know
new
york
has
extensive
power
installations
and
that
any
water
taken
out
of
the
great
lakes
of
chicago
reduces
the
flow
there.
this
is
not
only
a
loss
to
new
york
but
to
pennsylvania,
a
large
portion
of
which
is
served
by
this
tower.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
to
receive
water
as
a
part
of
a
riparian
community
but
we
also
say
that
this
being
a
riparian
water
state
and
an
inter
--
interstate
and
international
waterway,
the
doctrine
of
reasonable
use
of
course
requires
that
the
water
be
treated
and
returned
to
the
basin
and
therefore
that
if
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
--
it
is
taken
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
yes.
we
suggest
that
should
be
true
as
to
chicago
and
after
these
communities
we
suggest
further
that
they
have
no
initial
right.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
not
entirely.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
all
right.
the
damage
would
be
substantially
reduced
by
some
90%
but
the
principle
of
law
which
would
require
if,
for
example,
this
court
were
to
permit
the
board
the
complaint
and
were
to
enjoin
the
defendants
from
objecting
to
what
the
commission
proposed
to
do,
this
would
be
precedent
which
would
authorize
any
non-riparian
community
to
go
to
a
water
source
and
simply
take
without
leave
of
any
governmental
agency
or
without
negotiating
with
--
with
the
sovereigns
and
community
which
have
a
legal
right
to
the
water.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
in
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
say
that
no
need
has
been
shown
to
date
and
we
further
say
that
illinois
has
no
standing
here
parens
patriae.
we,
defendant
states
are
in
this
court
to
preserve
a
great
natural
resource
which
we
believe
rightfully
belongs
to
the
states
and
all
their
inhabitants.
illinois
is
here
in
quite
a
different
capacity.
illinois
is
here
in
order
that
a
corporation
may
sell
revenue
bonds.
we
think
this
case
--
this
situation
is
ruled
by
the
case
of
louisiana
against
texas.
in
that
case,
louisiana
brought
suit
against
the
governor
of
texas
and
the
health
authorities
because
in
the
application
of
the
quarantine
laws,
texas
had
in
effect
put
an
embargo
on
commerce
from
new
orleans.
and
louisiana
came
to
this
court
and
asked
parens
patriae
that
relief
be
granted
and
this
court
sustained
the
demurrer
saying
that
a
financial
loss
to
certain
individuals
within
a
state
does
not
give
rise
to
the
kind
of
action
which
this
court
can
hear
in
its
original
jurisdiction.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
i'm
suggesting
that
this
commission
has
no
authority
to
do
what
it
chooses
to
do.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
i
believe
its
page
20,
suggest
that
this
commission
is
authorized
to
divert
this
interstate
waters
and
he
cites
the
illinois
act
of
1957,
page
20
of
the
solicitor's
brief.
the
pertinent
part
of
that
statute
says
that
the
department
of
public
works
and
buildings
may
grant
subject
to
the
forgoing
provisions
of
this
section
a
permit
to
any
person,
firm
or
corporation,
not
a
riparian
owner
to
use
the
water
from
any
of
the
public
bodies
of
water
within
the
state
of
illinois.
that
statute,
we
maintain,
does
not
give
this
commission,
this
corporation,
the
authority
to
take
water
from
an
interstate
body
or
to
divert
water.
it
says
that
a
corporation
may
use
water
when
it
is
non-riparian.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
i
think
the
case
might
be
different
if
the
state
itself
were
involved
and
because
we
are
met
with
this
answer
as
general
adams
said,
when
we
attempt
to
deal
with
this
commission
and
suggest
that
they
in
negotiation
that
they
make
arrangements
to
purify
and
return
the
effluent,
we
are
met
by
the
answer
that
this
is
a
corporation
of
limited
powers
that
it
has
no
authority
to
deal
with
sewage
and
disposal.
and
therefore,
all
it
has,
the
authority
to
do
is
to
take
the
water.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
therefore
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
sovereign
who
has
unlimited
power
to
comply
with
a
decree
which
would
compel
it
to
do
these
things.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
this
is
the
answer
that
they
have
given
us
so
far.
i
think
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
this
is
the
answer
that
they
have
made
in
the
course
of
conversations.
so
that
we
feel
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
way
and
indeed
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
such
a
matter.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
new
jersey
against
new
york
which
is
relied
on
so
heavily
by
illinois
and
the
solicitor
general.
that
was
a
proper
case
of
equitable
apportionment
of
the
delaware
river.
there,
new
york
city
at
its
own
expense
built
reservoirs
and
dams
to
capture
the
floodwaters
of
the
delaware.
these
floodwaters
would
have
gone
unused
and
wasted
out
to
the
sea.
and
this
dam,
these
constructions
were
in
effect
a
great
help
to
the
flood
control
on
--
of
the
riparian
states
along
the
way
and
also
to
navigation.
but
in
addition,
this
court
conditioned
its
decree
upon
the
duty
of
new
york
to
maintain
a
minimum
flow
of
a
certain
number
of
cubic
feet
per
second
in
the
delaware.
and
during
this
past
summer
which
was
a
time
of
drought,
new
york
city
released
from
its
reservoirs
water
which
managed
more
than
half
of
the
flow
of
the
delaware
all
summer
and
in
effect
was
deprived
of
the
water
which
it
had
captured
at
its
own
expense.
now,
this
is
a
proper
case
of
equitable
apportionment
where
there
is
a
division
of
benefits
and
burdens.
new
york
did
not
take
water
belonging
to
the
other
states
without
giving
them
some
compensating
return.
i'd
like
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
there
had
been
cases
in
the
west
were
both
states
adhere
to
the
doctrine
of
prior
appropriation.
there
we
think
these
cases
are
not
of
course
applicable.
in
the
case
of
colorado
against
kansas,
kansas
at
that
time
or
at
least
for
the
waters
involved
adhered
to
the
riparian
doctrine,
colorado
did
not.
the
river
there
was
a
broken
river.
its
flow
was
interrupted.
in
effect
it
was
two
streams.
and
this
court
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
a
non-riparian
user
had
a
right
to
divert
water
and
said
this
was
a
very
serious
question
but
under
the
fact
of
that
case
or
other
water
was
used
for
irrigation,
it
was
returned
to
the
stream
and
therefore
in
an
arid
region,
the
whole
regimen
of
the
stream
and
the
area
was
improved
by
the
use
of
the
water.
now,
in
this
case,
it
is
difficult
to
see
that
there
is
any
improvement
or
benefit
conferred
upon
the
great
lakes
space
and
as
a
whole
or
anyone
else.
all
that
is
happening
is
that
you
save
this
particular
small
community
money,
the
water
is
being
taken
to
the
detriment
however
large
or
small,
of
all
of
the
other
great
lakes
states.
for
this
reason,
we
believe
that
the
motion
at
least
to
file
a
complaint
should
be
denied.
and
we
point
out
that
this
does
not
leave
these
communities
without
relief.
in
the
first
place,
they
can
buy
water
from
the
sanitary
district
if
in
fact
there
is
a
real
shortage
of
well
water.
illinois
can
negotiate
for
an
agreement
with
the
other
states
for
a
limited
amount
of
non-riparian
taking
with
the
return
of
the
effluent
and
if
the
sovereign
make
such
a
negotiation,
the
sovereign
state
will
have
to,
of
course
carry
out
the
undertaking.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
i
should
think
that
canada's
interest
would
have
to
be
considered
possibly
on
a
diplomatic
level.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
the
states
outside
of
the
great
lakes
water
basin,
we
think
that
the
states
downstream
along
the
mississippi
river
have
an
interest
and
we
have
received
any
number
of
communications
from
communities
down
the
way
asking
us
to
proceed
most
urgently
with
the
other
case
because
they
feel
that
they
are
being
harmed
by
the
flushing
of
the
sewerage
down
the
mississippi
river.
but
with
respect
to
taking
water
out
of
the
great
lakes,
we
do
not
see
that
the
other
states
which
do
not
--
water
on
the
great
lakes
and
are
not
part
of
the
watershed
have
any
particular
interest.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
we
feel
that
they
could
not.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
we
feel
that
that
equitable
apportionment
does
not
mean
a
division
of
the
waters
but
a
--
the
best
and
most
beneficial
use
of
this
interstate
water
system
is
great
resource
that
the
great
lakes
states
could
not
themselves
get
together
under
any
kind
of
an
interstate
compact
and
apportion
the
waters
out
and
deplete
the
natural
resource.
we
believe
that
though
we
have
a
right
to
enter
into
compact,
we
are
naturally
(voice
overlap).
ms.
lois
g.
forer
right.
and
mr.
justice
black,
we
believe
that
the
municipalities
which
actually
apply
on
a
body
of
water
are
of
course
riparian
and
since
the
municipality
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
municipalities
and
of
course
individual
communities.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
i
think
it
might
well
depend
upon
local
law
what
the
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
this
is
the
argument
that
illinois
is
making.
that
in
effect
under
the
supreme
court
1930
decree,
the
entire
state
of
illinois
has
a
right
to
divert
out
of
the
great
lakes
water
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
communities
in
the
state.
this
--
oh,
we
simply
do
not
accept
because
--
it
--
there,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
were
two
rather
well
defined
theories
of
water
law
in
--
that
are
recognized
in
the
united
states,
either
riparian
with
a
--
the
modification
of
reasonable
use
and
the
doctrine
of
prior
appropriation.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
yes.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
yes.
not
only
noncontiguous
but
they
are
in
a
different
watershed
and
the
watershed
here
is
undisputed
that
these
communities
are
outside
of
the
watershed
of
the
great
lakes
even
though
they
are
geographically
rather
close.
and
therefore
that
unless
the
water
is
--
actually
comes
back
into
the
lakes,
of
course,
it
will
not
return.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
we
don't
say
they're
the
only
ones
who
have
an
interest.
we
say
that
those
people
who
abut
in
those
communities
which
abut
along
a
waterway
have
the
right
under
existing
law
reasonably
to
use
the
water
that
flows
pass
them.
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
take
it
out
of
the
watershed
and
remove
it
from
the
stream.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
that's
right.
we
say
that
if
they
used
it
and
returned
it
to
the
stream
even
though
of
course
there
is
some
rule,
but
nevertheless
that
is
a
reasonable
use
that
is
quite
proper.
but
if
they
take
it
out
of
the
stream
and
divert
it
to
some
other
areas
so
that
it
is
never
returned
to
the
people
downstream
that
that
is
not
permissible.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
i
do
not
know
that
because
the
engineering
studies
to
which
we
have
all
adverted
which
of
course
they're
not
part
of
the
record
did
not
discuss
the
cause
of
making
such
a
return.
and
of
course
we
believe
that
that
would
be
a
matter
of
record.
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
we
feel
that
this
entire
matter
can
properly
be
handled
by
this
court
if
the
state
of
illinois
chooses
any
other
action
to
ask
leave
to
have
this
additional
taking
or
diversion
considered
along
with
the
others.
and
thus,
this
court
could
make
an
appropriate
order
with
respect
to
this
great
interstate
and
international
resource
which
could
be
effectuated
and
carried
out
by
sovereigns
having
a
complete
power
to
do
so.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
this
particular
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
this
particular
proceeding
--
ms.
lois
g.
forer
--
no
indeed,
because
we
do
not
feel
that
any
of
the
facts
are
alleged
with
such
particularity
that
we
can
accept
them
at
all.
we
think
all
the
questions
of
need
and
the
feasibility
of
return
and
everything
else
would
have
to
be
explored
in
a
factual
manner
by
a
master.
ms.
lois
g.
forer
well,
i
think
that
the
need
of
a
community
of
course
is
one
thing.
the
availability
of
other
sources
of
water
to
which
under
our
view
of
the
law,
they
are
rightfully
entitled.
that
has
not
been
explored
in
the
engineering
study
by
illinois
which
i
have
seen.
in
other
words,
the
only
sources
of
water
which
were
considered
by
these
engineering
studies
were
well
water
and
the
statement
about
the
$16
per
soap,
and
lake
michigan
water.
now,
as
we
all
know,
there
are
many
streams,
the
fox
and
the
des
planes
among
them
which
run
through
this
area.
we
do
not
know
at
this
time
whether
those
sources
of
supply
would
be
adequate
or
appropriate.
we
think
that
should
be
considered
too.
