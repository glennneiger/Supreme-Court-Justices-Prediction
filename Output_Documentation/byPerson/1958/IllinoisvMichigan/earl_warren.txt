mr.
bane,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
protest
when
these
other
communities
that
are
just
to
the
east
of
these
communities
got
their
water
for
a
similar
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
came
from
chicago
water?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
in
the
geographical
limits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
well
would
it
then
come
out
of
the
1700
second
feet
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
in
the
other
--
in
the
other
lakes
--
the
other
states
want
to
do
the
same
thing,
when
does
it
get
to
a
point
where
--
where
the
water
must
be
distributed?
i
suppose,
if
you
have
a
right
to
take
it
out
for
illinois
in
one
or
two
or
three
instances
by
probably
all
these
other
states
would
have
the
same
right,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
do
that.

chief

where
does

effluent
to

mr.
forer.
i
--
are
you
--
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
they
gave
me
--
oh,
mrs.
forer,
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief

there
are
no
cities
located
on
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
in
illinois,
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
forer,
would
you
have
any
objection
if
they
did
buy
their
water
from
the
sanitary
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
those
--
the
thing
that
i
--
i've
been
thinking
about
is
this,
if
--
if
they
could
by
the
water
from
the
sanitary
district
so
far
as
the
effect
on
the
lake
is
concerned
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
--
in
what
manner?
that's
what's
bothering
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
thinking
this
that
the
--
the
--
this
new
district
does
not
propose
to
return
the
effluent
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
neither
does
chicago,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
other
case,
that
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
your
advance
in
there.
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
maintain
that
that
position,
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
forer,
from
an
engineering
standpoint,
do
you
know
whether
it
would
be
(inaudible)
or
not
--
for
these
people
to
return
the
effluent
if
they
took
it
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
sit
down,
do
you
--
do
you
believe
that
this
matter
could
be
determined
without
a
master?
chief
justice
earl
warren
proceeding.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
not
think
general
then
that
this
--
this
particular
issue
in
this
case
could
be
handled
in
a
--
in
a
short
--
very
short
period
of
time
to
think
that
that
would
have
to
await
the
larger
problem.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
finish
your
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
going
--
i'm
just
going
to
ask
you
one
thing
about
--
about
canada
in
this
position.
i
suppose,
if
we
were
to
authorize
the
taking
of
water
for
this
purpose,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
us
to
complain
that
canada
might
do
the
--
might
be
doing
the
same
thing,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question
if
i
may.
if
--
if
the
situation
were
to
evolve
so
that
this
district
would
take
this
water
for
this
purpose
and
then
return
the
effluent,
do
you
think
that
that
would
--
it
would
be
unwise
to
proceed
on
the
theory
of
that
kind
as
being
destructive
of
the
other
interest
that
are
involved?

justice

warren
