mr.
john
w.
reynolds
if
it
pleases
the
court.
i
would
like
address
myself
in
state
of
wisconsin
to
only
four
points.
points
being
that
another
action
is
pending
the
damage
that
has
done
to
the
great
lakes
states,
declaratory
judgment
question
and
that
no
damage
is
done
in
state
of
illinois.
before
i
go
into
that,
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
black's
question
about
whether
or
not
this
problem
was
peculiar
to
the
chicago
area.
mr.
justice,
it
is
not
peculiar
to
that
area.
we
have
a
problem
of
my
hometown
in
green
bay.
we
ran
out
of
water
up
there
and
we
went
to
lake
michigan,
we
took
the
water,
we
purified
the
effluent,
we
put
it
back
in
lake
michigan.
we
put
it
back
in
green
bay.
and
the
same
problem
was
faced
in
sheboygan,
wisconsin,
fond
du
lac,
wisconsin,
milwaukee,
wisconsin.
this
problem
is
not
unique
to
chicago.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
they're
getting
water,
but
they're
returning
the
effluent
to
the
basin.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
the
--
general
adams
stated,
â€œit's
in
the
policy
of
all
the
great
lakes
states
that
when
the
cities
take
waters,
water
out
of
the
great
lakes,
that
the
affluent
is
returned
to
the
great
lakes.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
i
--
my
point
was
it's
widespread
north
of
chicago
and
wisconsin,
the
city
of
fond
du
lac,
which
is
located
on
lake
winnebago
at
the
present
time
is
having
a
major
political
fight
over
whether
or
not
they
should
build
a
pipeline
to
lake
michigan,
or
should
they
take
the
water
out
of
lake
winnebago,
which
is
a
small
shallow
lake.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
it's
growing,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
i
think
that
in
the
--
the
fact
of
another
action
is
pending.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
milwaukee
takes
the
water
from
lake
michigan.
it
purifies
it
and
returns
to
lake
michigan.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
we
have
no
objection
at
all
to
illinois
taking
the
water,
using
the
water
and
returning
it
to
the
great
lakes
basin.
and
later
on,
i'm
going
to
discuss
how
that
affects
our
--
the
issue
of
damages.
we
believe
that
the
issue
is
not
the
right
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
divert
water.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
they
should
be
compelled
to
return
the
water
to
the
great
lakes
basin.
if
the
--
if
issue
is
merely
for
the
right
you
can
take
water,
then
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
because
we
say
they
have
the
right
to
use
it.
our
point
is
that
when
they
do
use
it,
they
have
to
return
it
to
the
great
lakes.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
their
need
is
the
same
as
the
city
--
the
need
of
the
city
of
milwaukee,
the
need
of
cleveland,
ohio.
they
all
take
water
out
of
the
great
lakes.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
we
coarsely
recognized
their
need.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
if
they
have
any
water.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
i
--
i
personally,
i
would
believe
that
there
--
the
natural
wells
are
going
dry.
we
face
that
problem
in
the
green
bay.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
i
know
they
want
that.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
i'm
willing
to
believe
them,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
if
we
have
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
their
engineers.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
i
don't
want
to
say
the
issue
is
out.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
the
--
the
taking
of
the
water
--
the
diverting,
excuse
me,
the
diverting
of
the
water
from
the
great
lakes,
even
a
small
amount,
does
irrefutable
harm
to
all
the
great
lakes
states
because
it
establishes
a
precedent.
if
you
permit
these
three
communities
to
do
this,
you're
establishing
the
precedent
that
any
community
that
lives
within
a
pipeline
distance
of
lake
--
of
the
great
lakes,
that
they
shall
have
the
matter
of
right,
the
authority
to
take
water
out
of
the
great
lakes
and
dump
it
into
another
watershed
and
run
it
down.
the
city
of
cleveland
is
close
to
the
watershed
of
the
ohio
river.
the
city
of
milwaukee,
wisconsin
is
close
to
the
watershed
divide,
very
close,
just
on
the
waukesha
county,
and
they
have
toyed
with
the
possibility.
now,
the
fact
is
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
other
great
lakes
states,
we
have
insisted
that
our
communities
build
modern
sewage
and
expensive
disposal
plants
in
the
city
of
sturgeon
bay.
and
gentleman
at
a
case,
dealing
with
a
courthouse
up
there,
they
are
surrounded
by
water
and
yet
they
have
a
sewage
disposal
plant
before
they
dump
their
water
into
the
lake.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
the
--
i
don't
know
if
they
make
a
profit
at
it,
but
they
certainly
do
sell
it.
they
have
a
very
modern
plant.
it
--
if
we
permit
these
cities
to
do
what
they
ask,
we're
placing
a
tremendous
burden
on
--
on
the
sister
states,
how
can
we
compel
our
industry,
our
cities
to
go
to
the
expense
when
chicago
--
when
the
chicago
industry
doesn't
have
to
go
to
this
expense?
the
second
fact
is
that
allowing
them
to
divert
water
out
of
the
sewage,
out
of
the
great
lakes
has
the
effect
of
--
if
they
all
do
it,
of
literally
destroying
the
saint
lawrence
seaway.
we
talked
--
we've
heard
a
lot
about
five
inch,
five
eights
of
an
inch
or
an
inch.
one
inch
on
the
great
lakes
from
the
top
is,
of
course,
one
inch
from
the
bottom.
the
vessels
on
the
great
lakes
are
loaded
by
inches.
on
a
large
vessel,
one
inch
equals
180
tons
of
--
of
carrying
capacity
per
trip.
a
mollified
a
number
of
trips
and
you
get
the
--
what
the
law
says.
these
vessels
literally,
scrape
their
--
their
bottoms
as
they
go
through
some
of
these
channels
in
the
great
lakes.
and
so,
if
you
allow
chicago
in
the
major
action
which
will
--
to
take
water
made
after
10,000
cubic
feet
to
--
if
they're
going
to
expand.
if
they're
allowed
to
that
and
every
other
community
is
allowed
to
do
it,
you'd
lower
the
level
of
the
lake
two
or
three
feet.
and
we
believe
that
by
establishing
this
precedent,
if
we're
going
to
--
and
to
permit
any
city
that's
within
pipeline
distance
to
run
to
the
lake
and
take
the
water
and
dump
it
down
on
other
watershed,
it
would
materially
injure
the
saint
lawrence
seaway.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
the
chicago
effluent
was
in
the
chicago
drainage
canal.
see,
originally
around
1900,
they
turned
the
chicago
river
around.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
the
drainage
canal
down
to
the
des
plaines
river
into
the
illinois
river
and
it
goes
--
and
then
of
course
into
the
mississippi.
and
that's
why
they
need
this
under
the
1930
decree,
the
extra
1000
cubic
feet
to
literally
flush
their
--
this
open
sewer
out.
and
wisconsin
and
the
other
great
lakes
states
have
always
insisted
from
the
very
beginning
that
the
--
their
sister
states
and
sister
communities
have
the
duty
to
purify
their
effluent.
we
do
not
believe
that
in
this
present
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
we
do
not
believe
that
in
this
present
action
that
the
state
of
illinois
is
actually
hurt
as
it
brought
out
in
questions,
this
water
department
can
get
the
water
from
the
city
of
chicago.
the
simple
fact
is
they
could
sell
their
bonds
if
the
state
of
illinois
would
put
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
state
behind
this
water
commission.
and
that
we
have
made
no
threats
to
the
construction
of
the
water
works.
in
fact,
wisconsin
hasn't
even
sent
a
letter.
but
we
certainly
would
insist
that
any
additional
diversion
from
the
lake
will
be
prohibited.
and
that
any
water
that's
taken
out
of
the
lake
be
returned
to
lake
as
--
after
it
is
purified.
thank
you
very
much.
