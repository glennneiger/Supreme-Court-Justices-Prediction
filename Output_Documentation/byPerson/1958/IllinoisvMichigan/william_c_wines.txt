mr.
william
c.
wines
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
brief
reply
to
the
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
other
states
and
the
observations
of
the
solicitor
general,
may
i
return
the
court's
mind
to
the
imperious
exigency
that
is
confronting
these
communities
comprising
some
90,000
inhabitants
or
more.
your
honors,
they
are
on
the
verge
of
extinction
unless
water
is
worth
coming
from
lake
michigan.
our
brief
and
the
materials
submitted
to
the
court
do
demonstrate
notwithstanding
deprecation
of
those
brief
by
opposing
counsel
that
there
is
no
source
of
water
except
lake
michigan
for
these
communities.
now,
in
the
1930
decree,
if
your
honors
please,
this
court
recognized
the
right
of
illinois
to
take
water
for
domestic
pumpage
without
any
odd
measurement
by
the
terms
of
that
decree
in
cubic
feet
per
second
or
gallons
per
second.
chicago
sanitary
district
in
the
means
illinois
permitted
to
take
the
water
to
this
necessary
to
sustain
the
life
of
her
inhabitants
and
sustain
the
necessities
of
drinking,
bathing,
and
industrial
use.
the
authority
cited
in
our
brief
all
testified
to
the
fact
that
the
use
of
water
for
domestic
consumption
is
paramount,
is
primary
that
other
uses
such
as
contemplated
uses
for
power
even
for
navigation
have
to
await
the
use
for
drinking
daily,
living
itself.
there
has
been
discussion
as
to
whether
any
problems
would
arise
for
this
court's
justification
if
elmhurst
villa
park
and
lombard
would
purchase
water
from
chicago.
we
say
with
all
the
earnestness
at
our
command
that
legally,
the
situation
is
precisely
the
same
whether
the
water
is
taken
directly
by
these
municipalities
or
whether
it's
obtained
through
the
intermediacy
of
the
city
of
chicago.
a
gallon
of
water
taken
from
lake
michigan
is
a
gallon
of
water
taken
from
lake
michigan
whether
it
flows
through
chicago's
conduits
or
aqueducts
built
by
some
other
instrumentality
of
the
state
of
illinois.
i'm
not
too
clear
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
misrepresent
the
arguments
of
counsel
for
the
other
states
but
i
didn't
hear
a
serious
challenge
to
the
issue
of
need.
they
do
say
they
don't
know.
no
effort
apparently
has
been
made
to
ascertain
the
point
in
those
sources
of
water
rather
than
lake
michigan
and
we
assure
the
court
that
they're
right
on
such
source.
i'm
every
anxious
to
impress
on
the
court
this
vital
consideration.
your
honors,
we
need
that
water
and
we
need
it
in
the
very
immediate
future.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
a
master
be
appointed.
mr.
solicitor
general
rankin
suggested
in
his
briefs
in
numbers
2,
3
and
4
that
such
a
supervisory
functionary
ought
to
be
installed.
he
does
not
say
like
he
says
that
the
complainant
states
in
that
case
have
not
made
any
cause
for
relief
and
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
grant
the
relief
at
this
time.
he
suggests
that
a
master
be
appointed
that
have
supervisory
functions
for
reasons
that
we
have
submitted
in
our
brief
in
response
to
that
suggestion.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
occasion
for
the
appointment
of
a
master
but
be
that
as
it
may
with
respect
to
these
three
communities,
there
isn't
--
the
amount
of
water
that
we
seek
to
take
is
imperceptively
small.
it
can't
affect
tonnage
by
a
fraction
of
an
ounce
nothing
that
can
be
measured.
now,
practically
however,
there
is
a
great
difference
between
buying
water
from
chicago
and
obtaining
it
in
the
manner
that
is
contemplated
by
these
communities.
and
one
has
only
to
have
a
general
knowledge
of
chicago
and
its
environs
to
realize
that
for
water
to
be
taken
through
chicago
we'd
have
to
tear
up
some
of
the
most
miles
and
miles
and
miles
of
the
most
highly
developed,
valuable
real
estate
in
the
world.
the
--
the
consideration
is
impaired
impractical
whereas
the
solution
that
we
propose
is
immanently
feasible.
much
has
been
said
about
who
is
a
riparian
proprietor
but
there
has
been
some
suggestion
that
the
periphery
of
the
concept
of
the
riparian
interest
depends
on
the
contours
of
the
watershed.
well
most
of
chicago
lies
outside
the
great
lakes
watershed.
in
some
places,
that
--
that
watershed
is
only
a
mile
in
width.
it's
our
submission,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
need
here
is
urgent.
the
amount
to
be
taken
is
small.
we
needn't
fear
these
vague
threats
of
vast
depredations
on
the
lake
front.
there
--
i
won't
say
there'll
never
be
another
municipality
that
may
need
a
little
but
there
is
--
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
municipalities
that
are
going
to
take
any
--
any
huge
amounts
from
the
lake
and
not
put
it
back.
the
economics
of
the
region
wouldn't
support
it.
what
we're
asking
for
is
this.
we've
been
stopped
from
raising
the
revenues
needed
to
build
this
vitally
necessary
plant
by
intimations
from
our
sister
states
that
if
we
sell
those
bonds,
trouble
will
be
made
for
someone.
we
have
no
place
to
come
but
this
court
for
recourse.
and
we
are
asking
leave
to
fail
this
application
and
that
its
merits
be
considered
as
promptly
as
possible.
i
am
implying
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
please
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
say
that
it
is
not
feasible,
not
practical,
will
do
no
good
or
be
of
no
--
no
particular
help,
the
amount
involved
is
that
--
it
can't
be
measured
and
the
expenses
enormous
and
that
is
our
position.
however,
we
are
most
insistent
on
our
right
to
take
the
water
and
use
it.
we
don't
think
that
we
have
to
return
it.
some
of
the
suggestions
here
is
that
we
don't
even
have
a
right
to
take
it
because
we're
not
riparian.
that,
your
honors
means,
that
these
communities
have
to
wither
and
perish.
and
we
can't
believe
that
anything
in
the
jurisprudence
that
should
govern
sovereign
states
in
their
relation
requires
any
such
result
of
that.
thank
you
your
honor.
