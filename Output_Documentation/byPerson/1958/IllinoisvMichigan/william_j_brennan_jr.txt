justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
--
if
this
municipalities
to
the
east
not
part
of
chicago
are
being
served
by
chicago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
are
reasons
why
these
three
compatibly
served
by
chicago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
would
suggest
that
the
alternative
is
not
impossible,
however?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
could
justify
it
as
i
understood
your
argument,
do
i
get
it
correctly?
that
you
could
justify
what
you're
now
taking
under
the
1930
decree?
now,
if
you
just
said
that
illinois
could?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
quite
understand.
it's
just
this.
if
the
servicing
by
chicago
and
these
other
communities
to
which
west
--
east
of
these
three
is
within
the
description
of
for
domestic
uses
under
the
1930
decree,
why
can't
the
same
basis
be
use
to
justify
the
taking
of
the
service
of
these
three
communities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
this
use
would
be
equally
domestic
uses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
those
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
communities
to
the
east
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
any
of
the
other
communities
to
the
east
of
these
three
are
they?
are
they
for
chicago
uses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
within
the
decree,
are
they
--
are
they
chicago
uses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
there
be
any
reason
what
then
--
why
these
three,
in
servicing
these
three
communities,
would
not
also
be
chicago
uses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
milwaukee
make
(inaudible)
money
out
there,
don't
they,
by
selling
the
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
forer,
you're
suggestion
is
with
the
--
they
are
the
riparian.
i
think
you
--
the
question
using
riparian
communities
and
that
--
is
that
--
and
i
gather
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
could
be
a
community
which
is
not
within
that
definition.
that
should
have
no
right
to
take
in
any
event
from
the
lake,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
--
i'm
not
quite
clear
about
it,
the
argument.
if
this
complex
of
community
were
to
be
annexed,
i
understand
as
the
fact
of
the
matter
that's
not
in
the
court,
but
if
they
were
to
be
annexed
in
chicago,
if
chicago
holds
a
riparian
community,
would
not
that
annexation
qualify?
this
complex
also
as
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
true.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
i
--
as
i
understand
your
position,
that
would
be
true
whether
or
not
this
complex
of
the
riparian
community
because
you
suggest
that
should
preclude
as
to
chicago?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor
what
about
the
sales?
we
understand
they're
now
making
to
these
other
municipalities
intervening
to
this
complex
in
chicago?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
know
whether
any
of
these
communities
now
getting
water
from
chicago
are
outside
the
watershed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
treating
them,
the
government,
the
system,
you
mean
treat
them
as
if
they
were
just
one
case
and
not
independent?
