what
was
the
--
what
was
the
pumpage
for
water
supply
in
the
1930
decree?
as
i
remember
that
was
1700
cubic
feet
per
second.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
which
1700
was
for
drinking
purposes?
justice
william

household
use?
justice

now,
these
cities
are
not
in
the
chicago
metropolitan
area
or
are
they?
but
when
they
are
(voice

--
justice
william

douglas
had
--
hasn't
--
hasn't
the
need
for
the
use
of
this
water
for
sewage
disposal
--
think
decreased
over
the
years
or
has
it
increased?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
your
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
but
your
--
you
--
we
can't
divide
you
or
something,
you're
still
illinois.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
can't
put
on
just
the
different
half
and
say
on
different
part
of
illinois.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
is
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know
but
when
you're
looking
at
the
global
amount
to
be
allowed
from
--
taken
from
a
--
from
a
lake
you'd
--
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
global
needs
for
the
use
of
that
water
and
if
too
much
water
is
being
taken
the
--
for
the
sewage
purposes
it
could
be
--
the
formula
could
be
change
if
you're
taking
for
drinking
purposes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
since
i've
been
on
the
court,
i
--
i
remember
various
decrees
that
have
been
submitted
which
have
approved
entered
sanctioning
the
various
kinds
of
sewage
disposal
plans
directly
from
the
--
this
district
and
presumably,
decreasing
the
need
for
the
amount
of
water
that
was
originally
allocated
for
sewage
disposal
in
the
1930
decree.
i
don't
know.
i'm
just
wondering
why
these
15
cubic
feet
you
are
now
on
isn't
taken
out
of
the
100
and
--
out
of
the
1500
that
was
originally
assigned
for
sewage
disposal.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
easier
to
get
that
when
it
might
be
to
get
a
decree
from
this
court
increasing
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
know
why
--
why
illinois
--
have
you
--
have
you
--
has
illinois
examined
that,
explored
that
phase
of
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
except
your
problem
of
why
not
do
it
all
through
chicago.
that
would
have
been
still
not
be
answered
as
a
matter
of
law,
would
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
think
enough
just
for
myself
that
we'd
have
to
pass
that
first
before
we
get
to
--
to
your
request.
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
we're
dealing
here
with
those
a
lot
of
things
with
water
supply
problem
with
a
lot
of
different
straws
in
it
all
sucking
from
that
supply
and
if
what's
being
presently
taken
inevitably
reapportion
can
handle
your
problem,
that
might
be
the
fairest
way
in
doing
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
does
--
does
milwaukee
take
water
from
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
understand
as
i
read
the
briefs
of
wisconsin
and
michigan,
they
wouldn't
object
to
illinois
doing
that
in
this
(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
--
is
that
the
water
case,
the
only
case
we've
had
where
the
board
has
permitted
the
diversion
from
water
--
from
one
watershed
to
another
watershed?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
in
your
supplemental
brief,
you
would
find
using
non-riparian
in
the
sense
of
those
who
were
occupying
a
geographical
area
that
was
in
different
watershed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
--
you
have
all
the
watershed
--
you
have
ultimately
a
question
of
pollution
i
suppose
even
with
the

with
effluent
because
it's
