do
you
know
whether
that
problem
is
peculiar
to
illinois
or
is
one
that
is
prevalent
throughout
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
express
any
interest
in
this
litigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
have
to
ask
for
anymore
water?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
to
ask
for
anymore
water,
chicago
would
have
furnished
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
i
--
i
mean
though
would
it
be
necessary
to
add
a
more
--
an
allowance
of
more
water
in
order
for
chicago
to
supply
these
communities?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
would
take
more,
but
is
it
not
allowed
to
take
more
under
the
apportionment
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
--
then
--
then
why
this
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
in
this
proceeding?
why
it
shows
that
under
the
1930
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
do
take
it
out
of
the
1700
feet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
mr.
bane,
within
the
1700
or
within
that
which
is
described
as
the
domestic
uses
for
or
are
they
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
you're
saying
--
why
you
consider
this
as
a
small
amount
compared
to
this
(inaudible)
why
is
it
enough
that
other
cities
would
form
some
kind
of
groups
to
get
for
them,
all
around
in
chicago.
and
why
--
how
candidates
be
properly
taken
of
without
considering
the
whole
thing
of
how
that
water
can
be
divided,
if
it
is
to
be
divided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
small,
but
then
that
is
[laughs]
relatively
speaking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
pretty
--
pretty
large.
and
a
few
like
this
would
--
you
could
say
each
one
of
them
is
small.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
can
we
know
they're
not?
how
is
it
possible
to
know
that
the
water
problem
is
becoming
a
great
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
not
become
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
merely
there.
how
can
we
know,
but
that
there
are
--
there's
--
and
how
can
we
probably
dispose
of
this
when
the
other
states
are
interested
without
having
the
full
matter
in
a
way
considered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
making
for
a
special
order
which
would
be
for
a
year.
and
of
course,
if
they
got
it
for
a
year
and
they
got
deprived
to
establish
in
everything,
then
you'd
have
the
--
the
benefits
of
possession.
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
take
it
away
from
the
people
who
need
it.
in
the
other
states,
they're
complaining
now
that
before
this
is
done,
they
should
all
be
heard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
except
that
to
--
it's
the
way
human
nature
works.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
say
the
same
problem
faces
on
this
get
board
of,
they
are
already
getting
water.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
does
it
--
are
there
other
places
that
are
not
getting
it
back
that
it
likely
to
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
that,
what
the
question
i
was
asking
you
was
a
little
different,
was
this.
they
say
that
while
their
--
this
particular
problem,
this
need
for
water
is
area
--
area
has
become,
that
is
not
a
widespread
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
so
the
population
up
there
is
growing,
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
other
places
that
we
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
in
your
judgment
could
be
the
proper
thing
to
do,
and
then
you
think
that
is
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
the
complaints
should
be
dismissed
on
the
(inaudible)
of
the
cases
to
be
consolidated
to
the
others
to
place
on
the
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
full
text
of
that,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
about
the
other
states
that
are
not
what
you
would
call
riparian?
do
they
have
any
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
--
could
the
states
that
border
on
it
divide
it
up
and
dry
up
the
lake,
apportioning,
equitable
apportionment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why,
if
no
other
state
has
the
interest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
up
and
you
have
emphasized
so
much
the
rights
of
riparian
owners
that
i'm
wondering
is
it
possible
to
define
who
the
riparian
owners
are
at
great
lakes?
if
--
if
the
people
within
10-mile
are,
are
they?
are
riparian
owners
--
while
the
people
within
20-mile
of
that
are
not
riparian,
who
are
riparian?
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
define,
put
a
label
of
the
law
and
say
that
under
the
law,
they
have
certain
specific
definite
right
because
they
are
riparian?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
municipality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
local
law
so
far
as
the
distribution
is
concerned
that
the
state
can
control
fully
apart.
what
about
a
state
if
it's
on
the
border
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
stream
is
navigated,
how
can
it
be
said
that
in
effect
that
those
within
the
particular
space
by
the
water
would
run
out,
taken
out,
are
the
only
ones
that
have
an
interest
and
it's
in
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
drawing
a
distinction
fairly
true
and
on
the
basis
of
taking
it
out
for
use
and
putting
it
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
get
what
you
mean
by
any
burden
on
other
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
thing,
the
word
loses,
i
didn't
quite
get
the
burden.
i
thought
you
meant
there
was
some
burden
on
that
to
have
illinois
lose
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
--
i
don't
quite
understand
your
basic
premise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
be
true
that
there
is
some
need
of
water
at
this
time
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
is
proven
beyond
any
shadow
of
doubt
that
they
need
it,
and
they
could
get
it
from
this
lake.
is
it
your
position,
they
have
a
right
as
a
matter
of
law
to
get
that
water
merely
because
they
need
it?
without
taking
into
consideration
the
effect,
the
withdrawal
of
that
water
might
have
in
the
long
run
on
a
growing
country,
with
an
ever
increasing
population?
and
then
the
likelihood,
if
that
what's
--
it
might
destroy
not
merely
a
great
source
of
navigation
where
people
could
make
money,
or
a
great
source
of
recreation
and
use
here,
something
that
the
country
needs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
get
why
it
would
be
enough
for
them
to
show
that
a
particular
community
needs
something
at
a
particular
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
true
in
the
west
were
they
have
droughts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
needed
enough
to
where
they
--
to
be
shown
within
the
next
five
years
they
needed
enough
water
below
that
lake
two
inches
and
that
that
would
seriously
affect
navigation
and
i
believe
it
that
a
state
where
it
seems
to
have
the
--
if
i'm
not
be
as
pure
as
it
is
and
so
forth.
suppose
they
could
show
that,
does
that
mean
that
they
could
on
some
basis
of
apportionment
among
the
states
around
and
get
the
water
to
the
extent
where
they
destroyed
the
great
national
value
and
the
part
of
the
international
value
that
it
have
as
a
--
as
a
lake.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
it
be
done
without
having
a
long
range
of
view
of
the
situation
as
it
is
now
as
distinguished
from
a
situation
which
existed
when
the
original
decree
was
rendered
with
the
knowledge
that
not
merely
chicago
and
other
areas
there
increasing
in
population
and
necessity
for
water,
both
for
industry
and
domestic
purposes
but
all
over
the
nation.
how
can
it
be
decided?
i'm
a
little
frightened
about
that
--
of
a
problem
that
arises,
the
purpose
important
as
it
is
to
these
communities,
how
can
it
possibly
be
treated
in
isolation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
rankin,
i'd
like
to
add
one
word
of
what
justice
frankfurter
said.
i
agree
fully
of
that,
the
idea
of
it,
(inaudible)
the
court
has
urged
the
states
to
get
together.
speaking
for
myself,
in
any
such
agreement
of
that
kind,
i'd
work
that
out,
i
would
think
that
the
united
states
should
have
a
representative
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
lake
is
a
national
asset
certainly
in
some
of
its
aspects.
it
could
not
be
properly
treated
without
it
when
state
compacts
of
course
have
to
go
to
congress.
but
i
--
i
certainly
want
to
back
up
what
he
said
as
to
the
great
help
that
can
come
from
having
an
effort
by
the
states
and
those
who
handle
it
to
get
together
rather
than
to
try
to
submit
it,
it's
difficulties
on
the
lawsuit.
