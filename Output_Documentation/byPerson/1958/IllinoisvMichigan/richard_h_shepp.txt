mr.
richard
h.
shepp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
just
to
bring
the
court
back
to
review
the
complaint
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
of
course
we're
considering
whether
illinois
shall
be
given
leave
to
sue
the
rest
of
us
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint,
to
this
is
--
before
this
court.
it's
our
position,
it's
my
position
at
least
that
i'm
sure
it's
the
position
of
the
rest
of
my
colleagues
that
the
complaint
does
not
invoke
the
parens
patriae
doctrine
in
--
in
the
present
writing
of
the
complaint.
if
this
lawsuit
is
either
a
class
action
or
a
private
lawsuit
which
has
never
been
within
the
--
never
been
taken
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
type
of
action
between
sovereign
states.
to
look
at
the
complaint
itself,
it
--
it
--
the
factual
obligations
involved
the
water
needs
of
90,000
people,
the
formation
of
a
commission,
the
commission
being
a
public
corporation
going
into
the
business
of
hiring
engineers
of
engaging
in
contracts
for
the
acquisition
of
its
rights
of
way
for
its
properties
and
entering
into
contracts
for
the
sale
of
its
water
and
for
the
contracts
of
the
sale
of
it
bonds.
threats
the
allegation
say
by
the
attorney
general,
however
made
the
delivery
of
the
bonds
impossible.
we
contend
it's
my
position
at
any
rate
that
that
is
the
principle
grievance
of
this
particular
complaint.
the
--
the
failure
of
the
inability
of
illinois
of
the
commission
to
sell
its
bonds.
the
remaining
allegations
of
the
complaint
make
it
clear
that
this
is
an
action
primarily
for
the
commission
for
the
sole
benefit
of
this
public
corporation
and
not
for
the
state
of
illinois.
i
refer
for
instance
to
the
complaint.
in
paragraph
12,
the
complaint
reads,
â€œthe
commission
here
involved
there's
only
the
power
to
acquire
a
supply
of
water.
it
has
no
function
or
power
to
dispose
of
the
sewage
effluent.
only
parts
of
the
communities
to
be
observed
by
the
commission
are
within
the
metropolitan
sanitary
district
of
chicago.
but
like
that
district,
they
all
dispose
of
their
sewage
effluent
into
the
mississippi
watershed.
then
the
complaint
goes
on
further
to
say
in
paragraph
13
on
page
13,
the
question
of
return
of
sewage
effluent
by
that
area
is
involved
in
the
other
proceedings
in
--
in
original
actions
two,
three
and
four
for
which
are
the
most
impending
before
this
court.
the
right
of
the
commission,
the
complaint
states
to
withdraw
water
from
the
lake
for
domestic
purposes
as
proposed
by
it
should
be
declared
without
consideration
of
any
demand
by
the
defendants
that
the
sewage
effluent
resulting
from
--
therefrom,
that
is
from
their
own
water
it's
directions
should
be
returned
to
the
lakes.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
reading
of
that
complaint
where
--
where
the
scope
of
it
involves
from
any
angle
there's
a
limited
size
of
area
involved.
a
small
quantity
of
water
the
bond
problem
of
the
commission
and
a
request
to
limit
the
action
to
this
action
here
to
a
ruling
that
the
commission
has
the
right
to
withdraw
water
without
respect
to
the
whole
picture
the
reasonable
uses
involved
that
illinois
would
be
concerned
with.
it
--
it
only
points
to
the
conclusion
that
the
--
that
the
complaint
is
not
a
proper
parens
patriae
situation.
mr.
richard
h.
shepp
the
--
mr.
richard
h.
shepp
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
the
proper
remedy
for
the
state
of
illinois
to
raise
the
whole
rather
than
the
piece
--
piecemeal
litigation
is
to
go
back
to
the
original
actions
number
2,
3
and
4.
they
are
not
without
remedy,
if
they
do,
we
have
grievance.
that's
my
