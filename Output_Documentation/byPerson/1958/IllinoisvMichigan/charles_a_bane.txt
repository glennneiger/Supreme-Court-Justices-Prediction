mr.
charles
a.
bane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
illinois
is
here
seeking
leave
to
file
a
complaint
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
whereby
it
is
asking
that
this
court
declare
illinois'
rights
to
take
an
imperceptibly
small
amount
of
water
from
lake
michigan
through
the
state's
instrumentality,
the
elmhurst-villa
park-lombard
water
commission.
the
matter
we
maintain
is
one
of
immediate
urgency
in
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
approximately
90,000
people
to
be
served
by
the
commission
with
water
for
drinking,
hygienic,
sanitary
and
life
and
industrial-commercial
purposes,
all
of
which
can
be
aggregated
under
the
phrase,
"domestic
pumpage."
the
amount
which
is
proposed
to
be
taken
over
the
next
20
years
will
be
about
at
the
level
of
25
to
30
cubic
feet
per
second,
which
is
the
manner
in
which
you
measure
taking
of
water
and
if
that
amount
is
expected
to
grow,
so
that
by
the
year
2000,
it
will
still
be
only
in
the
range
of
about
50
cubic
feet
per
second.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
light
industrial
purposes,
your
honor,
yes.
there
is
no
heavy
industrial
activity
in
this
area,
or
which
will
be
served
by
the
commission.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
between
light
and
heavy
industrial?
well,
we
simply
don't
have
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
steel
works,
anything
--
an
automobile
assembly
plant,
nothing
that
would
be
in
the
--
in
that
range.
i
think
the
distinction
is
probably
not
important
except
that
justice
holmes,
in
wisconsin
against
illinois,
expressed
the
general
kind
of
reservation
as
to
whether
domestic
pumpage
purposes
would
include
heavy
industrial
use.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that's
the
only
reason
that
we
make
the
point
that
it
is
light
industrial
use
indubitably,
as
we've
alleged
in
our
complaint,
which
is
involved
here
and
which
is
in
this
area.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
i
think
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
probably
so.
however,
the
--
the
nature
of
the
communities
now
is
primarily
really
residential
as
we've
alleged
in
our
complaint.
there
is
a
commercial
operation,
of
course,
in
connection
with
the
residential
character
of
its
community.
the
light
--
the
industrial
activity
is
really
only
incidental.
these
communities
are
residential
communities
within
the
chicago
suburban
area.
they
are
commuter
communities,
if
you
please,
with
some
incidental
commercial
and
industrial
activity.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
in
the
1930
decree,
your
honor,
the
city
of
chicago
was
ultimately
to
be
restrained,
i
think,
beginning
with
the
year
1938
to
1500
cubic
feet
per
second
as
direct
diversion.
and
there
was
evidence
in
the
1930
case
that
the
taking
by
the
city
of
chicago
for
domestic
purposes
was
in
the
range
of
about
1700
cubic
feet
per
second.
so,
that
in
the
case
of
chicago,
and
--
and
when
you're
talking
about
the
--
the
facts
involved
in
the
1930
decree,
you're
talking
about
3200
cubic
feet
per
second,
which
of
course
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
correct,
sir.
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that's
correct.
and
i
will
come
to
the
point,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
reservation
in
the
1930
decree
with
respect
to
domestic
pumpage.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
they
are
a
part
of
the
chicago
metropolitan
area,
but
they
are
not
a
part
of
the
chicago
sanitary
district
and
they
have
their
own
sewage
disposal
facility.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
no,
sir.
they
were
not.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
relatively
new,
certainly
not
served
by
the
--
by
the
metropolitan
sanitary
district
of
chicago.
those
comparisons,
incidentally,
i
think
might
give
the
court
an
idea
of
what
we're
talking
about
here.
if
i
could
just
repeat,
we're
talking
about
25
to
30
cubic
feet
per
second
by
comparison
with
that
1700
cubic
feet
per
second
which
chicago
was
taking
in
1930
for
domestic
purposes
and
by
comparison,
30
to
50,
by
comparison
with
1500
cubic
feet
per
second,
which
the
1930
decree
ultimately
allowed
to
chicago
for
direct
diversion
down
the
sanitary
canal.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
the
need
of
--
of
the
direct
diversion
that
has
been
taken
by
chicago?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
we
can
--
we
can
respond
for
that
because
that
of
course
is
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
--
it's
not
an
issue
on
this
proceeding.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
no,
sir.
we're
not
--
we're
not
attempting
to
although
we
do
maintain
that
the
issue
within
numbers
2,
3
and
4
are
different
from
and
distinct
from
the
issue
in
this
number
15.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
basically
the
--
basically
the
proceeding
in
number
2,
3
and
4
as
your
honor
knows,
was
a
proceeding
which
goes
to
the
need
for
direct
diversion
of
water
from
lake
michigan
by
the
state
of
illinois
in
order
to
cleanse
out
the
sanitary
canal
and
the
illinois
waterways.
the
primary
purposes
or
the
primary
concerns
in
that
---
in
that
proceeding
were
with
respect
to
sanitation
and
the
efficient
operation
of
the
sanitary
district
and
with
navigation.
now,
either
one
of
those
is
any
kind
of
an
issue
in
this
case
which
has
to
do
simply
with
the
right
of
these
communities
illinois
on
behalf
of
these
communities
to
take
water
for
domestic
purposes.
there's
no
issue
with
respect
to
navigation.
these
communities
are
not
within
the
sanitary
district.
they
do
not
discharge
their
effluent
into
the
sanitary
canal.
the
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
--
no
problem
with
navigation
or
sanitation
on
sanitary
canal.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
court
can
concentrate
on
the
aggregate
amounts
that
are
being
taken
by
illinois.
we
certainly
maintain
however,
that
when
you
consider
what
is
being
proposed
here
to
be
taken
even
if
you
added
in
what
is
being
taken
under
the
1930
decree
and
being
taken
by
the
city
of
chicago,
we
have
--
we
add
such
an
imperceptible
amount
to
the
taking
by
illinois
that
we
are
fully
entitled.
we
--
we
maintain
to
have
come
--
come
within
the
day
to
be
permitted
to
do
what
we
proposed
to
do.
actually,
if
you
--
in
order
to
give
the
court
an
idea
of
the
effects
of
these
takings
on
the
--
on
the
lake
levels,
it
is
generally
agreed
that
taking
about
1000
cubic
feet
per
second
would
have
a
permanent
effect
on
the
lake
levels
of
about
five
eights
of
an
inch.
the
army
engineers'
estimates
which
were
put
into
the
house
committee
record
on
the
hearings
on
house
bill
1
which
had
been
pending
before
the
congress
to
authorize
an
experimental
diversion
of
the
thing
1000
cubic
meters
in
chicago.
the
army
estimate
put
into
that
hearing
range
from
a
permanent
effect
of
one
quarter
of
an
inch
to
one
inch.
but
generally
prior
to
the
time
of
those
estimates
were
put
in
it
was
taken
that
a
drawing
of
1000
cubic
feet
per
second
would
have
an
effect
on
the
lake
of
five
eights
of
an
inch.
that's
not
an
annual
effect.
that's
the
permanent
effect
once
a
taking
has
been
established.
that
again,
we
ask
the
court
to
compare
with
the
proposed
taking
here
of
some
30
cubic
feet
per
second,
if
1000
cubic
per
second
only
affects
the
lake
levels
to
five
eights
of
an
inch
then
we
think
we
certainly
are
correct
when
we
say
that
the
taking
of
30
cubic
feet
per
second
would
have
an
imperceptible
effect
on
the
lake
levels.
well,
if
this
amount
which
is
proposed
to
be
withdrawn
is
insignificant
and
imperceptible
in
terms
of
its
effect
on
the
lake
levels,
it's
certainly
is
not
insignificant.
we
maintain
in
terms
of
the
needs
of
the
communities
which
are
vital
significance.
these
communities
which
organized
the
commission
the
elmhurst-villa
park-lombard
water
commission
and
which
in
the
main
are
the
communities
which
are
to
be
served
by
the
commission
help
and
serve
and
are
now
being
served
by
ground
wells
which
are
proving
to
be
inadequate
for
the
present
needs
of
the
people.
the
needs
of
the
people
have
exceeded
the
water
supply
that
is
available
from
these
underground
sources.
the
water
level
in
the
existing
wells
has
been
dropping
at
an
average
of
from
7
to
10
feet
per
year.
and
during
the
year
1958,
in
fact,
there
was
a
recession
of
water
levels
to
the
extent
of
20
to
30
feet.
wells
have
been
drilled
deeper
and
deeper
and
pumps
have
been
set
lower
and
lower
until
at
the
present
time
the
pumps
have
been
set
at
the
lowest
practicable
setting.
and
the
wells
themselves
are
now
at
a
depth
of
approximately
1800
feet
at
2000
feet
it
has
been
found
that
salt
water
is
reached
and
the
result
is
that
the
wells
are
at
the
lowest
possible
point
for
any
type
of
use.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
your
honor
i
don't
know
that
and
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
also
would
be
fair
to
say
that
it
is
not
prevalent
throughout
illinois.
it's
certainly
is
true
however
with
respect
to
this
area
which
is
to
be
served
by
this
commission.
there
is
evidence
and
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
as
you
go
westward
from
these
communities,
the
wells
are
likely
to
be
adequate
or
seem
to
be
adequate
according
to
engineering
estimate
for
the
present
needs
of
the
people.
but
in
this
particular
area
to
be
serve
by
this
commission,
there
is
this
inadequacy
which
can't
be
solved
by
setting
the
wells
any
lower,
it
can't
be
solved
by
any
additional
wells
because
if
you
sink
additional
wells
you
simply
divide
up
by
wells
the
existing
supply
and
do
not
in
fact
increase
that
supply,
so
with
that
of
course
no
alternative.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir
generally
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
congressman
o'brien
sponsored
the
bill,
it's
house
bill
number
1,
to
which
the
dominion
of
canada
has
objected
authorized
--
which
would
authorized
for
a
period
of
one
year
a
direct
diversion
of
an
additional
1000
cubic
feet
per
second
down
the
chicago
sanitary
canal
and
into
the
illinois
waterways.
maintained
by
the
illinois
congressional
delegation
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
observe
the
effects
on
navigation,
on
sanitation
to
the
canals
and
also
to
observe
the
effects
which
illinois
maintained
would
be
insignificant
in
terms
of
any
effect
on
the
lake
level.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
completely
unrelated,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
illinois
as
a
state
is
of
course
acting
through
the
legislative
processes
to
see
whether
it
can
secure
the
approval.
we
are
appearing
here
for
a
much
less
significant
amount
and
an
amount
which
will
have
nothing
to
do,
which
will
not
be
a
direct
diversion
matter
in
any
sense
but
which
in
fact
is
necessary
for
the
needs.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
correct
sir.
yes,
it
would
be
an
experimental
thing.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
as
we
understand
it,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that's
basically
it
your
honor,
yes.
the
--
the
experiments
would
be
observed
as
i
understand
the
bill
by
the
army
corps
of
engineers
so
that
the
federal
government
would
be
the
--
the
agency
which
would
be
observing
the
effects.
illinois
isn't
proposing
that
it
itself
be
the
observer.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
i
don't
know
that
it
has
sir.
it
has
expressed
its
views
through
the
state
department
which
in
turn
of
course
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
those
views
intended
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
i
don't
know
that
--
that
they
made
it
--
made
it
specific.
i
don't
know
that
they
--
they
expressed
it
in
terms
of
--
in
fact
i'm
quite
certain
that
they
did
not
expressed
it
in
terms
of
effect
on
water
power
anything
of
that
character.
they
simply
said
that
they
had
an
interest
and
that
they
were
unwilling
to
see
this
diversion
take
place.
i
think
that's
the
way
in
which
it
was
communicated
through
congress
by
the
--
by
the
state
department.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
your
honor
these
are
army
corps
of
engineers
estimates
and
evidently
what
takes
place
is
that
as
you
divert,
of
course
i
assume
the
--
i
assume
that
the
effect
would
be
--
would
be
felt
almost
immediately
as
the
diversion
was
brought
about.
you
achieve
a
--
or
you
--
you
bring
about
a
reduction
in
the
lake
levels
but
then
you
strike
a
balance
as
between
the
taking
and
then
all
of
the
sources
which
feed
into
the
lakes.
you
strike
a
balance
so
that
once
--
once
that
initially
effect
has
been
felt
for
five
eights
of
an
inch,
once
you
felt
that
then
--
then
there
is
nothing
further
beyond
that.
that's
the
reason
i
gather.
i
am
more
participated
in
any
of
these
studies
made
by
the
army
corps
of
engineers
but
that
is
the
reason
i
gather
that
once
the
effect
is
felt
that's
the
effect,
it
isn't
repeated,
it
isn't
five
eights
of
an
inch
year
after
year
but
it
is
the
same
effect
maintained
throughout
the
years
from
many
give
and
taking.
1000
cubic
feet
of
course
was
not
adapted
as
the
standard.
actually,
it
happens
to
be
a
healthy
standard,
i
mean
a
--
a
usable
standard.
i
think
it
was
adopted
as
a
standard
because
it
was
--
the
information
was
being
given
to
the
congress
in
connection
with
this
proposal
in
house
bill
1
for
an
addition
of
diversion
experimentally
of
1000
cubic
per
second.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that's
correct
sir.
of
course,
sometime
--
sometime
it
would
be
required.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
--
that
is
our
understanding
your
honor
which
i
will
qualify
only
by
saying
as
i
did
before
that
the
range
of
the
estimate
seems
to
be
of
a
quarter
of
an
inch
to
one
inch.
but
by
enlarge
there
was
a
settling
on
five
eights
of
an
inch
as
the
probable
effect
of
the
diversion
of
that
much
1000
cubic
per
second.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
none
whatsoever
sir,
no.
the
solicitor
general
as
you
know
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
and
we
take
it
that
if
canada
had
adopted
the
position
on
this,
it
would
have
been
expressed
and
transfer
them
to
the
court
by
the
solicitor
general.
so
there's
been
no
expression
for
opinion
on
--
on
this.
i
will
just
to
add
with
respect
to
the
statement
of
facts
that
--
that
i
gave
with
respect
to
our
situation
here
that
they
are
of
course
there
is
no
--
no
record
in
this
proceeding
since
we
are
here
now
on
our
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
complaint.
these
facts
which
i
have
given
are
set
forth
in
our
complaint
which
we
seek
to
file
and
also
there
is
certain
engineering
data
which
is
contained
in
two
affidavits
which
we
filed
in
connection
with
a
motion
which
this
court
denied
for
summary
judgment.
these
affidavits
and
the
complaint
in
our
reply
brief
all
amply
demonstrate
that
in
order
to
meet
this
situation
with
which
illinois
was
confronted
in
these
communities,
there
is
no
adequate
source
of
water
now
available
to
them
except
lake
michigan.
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
preference
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
wanting
to
turn
the
lake
michigan
because
of
the
purity
of
the
water
or
the
quality
of
it.
the
fact
is
according
to
these
engineer's
affidavits
and
the
allegations
in
our
complaint,
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
alternative
source
of
water
for
these
communities
whose
wells
are
now
proving
to
be
inadequate,
there
is
no
source
of
water
for
them
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
--
except
the
lake.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
it
came
to
ahead,
your
honor,
in
about
the
year
1957.
about
--
just
about
two
years
ago.
and
at
that
time,
the
street
communities
organized
as
they
were
authorized
to
do
under
illinois
local
law
--
statutory
law,
the
commission
which
we
have
referred
to
here.
just
to
give
you
a
little
further
orientation
on
the
matter
geographically
elmhurst
is
the
nearest
of
these
communities
to
lake
michigan.
it's
approximately
16
miles
inland
to
the
west
of
the
city
of
chicago.
villa
park
then
joined
elmhurst
on
the
west
being
there
for
a
little
bit
further
away
from
the
lake
and
lombard
in
turn
then
adjoins
villa
park
on
the
west.
of
these
were
the
three
communities
which
organized
the
commission,
which
was
setup
pursuant
to
illinois
statutory
law
to
construct
the
system
for
a
common
supply
of
water
and
to
construct
the
necessary
water
mains
leading
from
the
source
of
water
to
the
municipalities.
the
commission
had
authority
to
finance
construction
of
its
system
to
the
sale
of
revenue
bonds
payable
from
revenues
derived
by
the
commission
under
its
water
contracts.
the
commission
took
a
number
of
steps
in
the
latter
part
of
1957
and
throughout
the
year
1958.
it
contracted.
it
determined
first
of
all
in
accordance
with
the
engineering
studies
which
had
indicated
that
lake
michigan
was
the
only
available
source
of
water.
the
commission
contracted
for
the
purchase
of
a
site
on
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
within
the
village
of
glen
cove
for
a
water
intake
and
pumping
station.
it
contracted
for
the
purchase
of
a
site
a
little
further
inland
for
a
filtration
plan
and
contracted
also
for
an
easement
for
its
water
mains
most
of
which
would
run
along
the
right
of
way
of
the
chicago
and
northwestern
railroad
all
within
illinois.
the
transmission
mains
were
to
be
approximately
14
miles
in
length
and
would
be
required
to
carry
the
roll
water
from
lake
michigan
at
the
intake
point
in
glen
cove
through
the
commission's
proposed
filtration
plant.
the
treated
water
was
then
to
have
been
transmitted
by
the
commission
to
the
municipal
boundaries
of
its
customers.
the
location
of
these
facilities
is
set
forth
on
a
general
location
map
which
is
included
as
a
part
of
our
motion
for
reason
to
file.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
we
--
we
think
not
your
honor.
so
far
as
this
proceeding
is
concern
of
course
there
is
nothing
in
the
complaint
nor
nothing
or
anything
in
such
of
a
record
as
we
have
that
relates
to
anything
to
any
--
anybody
except
these
three
communities.
i
might
just
say
that
it's
unlikely,
quite
unlikely
that
there
would
be
any
--
any
demand
by
the
communities
to
the
east
of
these
communities
between
these
communities
and
the
city
of
chicago
because
those
communities
are
now
being
served
with
lake
michigan
water.
they
are
not
taking
it
directly
but
they
are
being
served
by
the
city
of
chicago
with
lake
michigan
water.
and
that
comes
right
up
almost
that
--
that
service
of
lake
michigan
water
comes
almost
up
to
the
eastern
boundary
of
these
communities.
as
you
go
west
from
these
communities,
the
--
the
engineering
data
seems
to
indicate
that
the
wells
with
which
these
communities
are
being
served
are
adequate
and
are
likely
to
remain
adequate
for
the
foreseeable
future.
still
further
west
we
get
into
the
fox
river
valley
area
where
the
communities
are
served
by
a
combination
of
wells
and
the
fox
river
and
the
engineering
data
seems
to
indicate
that
that
is
an
adequate
source
of
supply
for
those
communities.
now,
in
state
in
illinois
100
miles
away
125,
150
miles
away
there
have
been
water
problem
but
in
no
instance
of
course
has
there
been
any
proposal
that
those
communities
would
come
to
lake
michigan.
they
have
gone
to
the
illinois
river
or
they
have
found
wells
in
one
case
an
industrial
plant
rather
ingeniously
takes
water
from
an
ample
source
underground
puts
it
into
a
river
uses
the
river
then,
the
riverbed
is
the
transmitter
of
the
water
and
takes
it
back
out
of
the
river
some
15
or
20
miles
down
the
stream.
all
ingenious,
but
none
of
it,
none
of
it
calling
for
any
turning
to
lake
michigan
as
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes
they
are,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
engineering
wise,
it
--
it
was
--
it
would
not
have
been
easy
and
after
a
full
study
had
been
made
it
seem
to
these
communities
that
it
was
better
for
them
to
go
directly
to
this
site
which
was
available
to
them
and
that's
how
it
came.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
the
alternative
is
not
impossible,
your
honor,
no.
of
course,
you
understand
that
if
that
alternative
were
adopted,
these
communities
would
be
taking
lake
michigan
water,
they
would
be
getting
it
via
chicago,
but
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
water
which
is
not
now,
it
would
be
water
from
lake
michigan
your
honor
which
is
not
now
coming
to
them.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
there
is
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well
there's
a
potential
supply
on
the
lake
of
course.
actually
there
has
been
no
allocation
to
chicago
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
--
of
an
amount
for
domestic
pumpage
the
limitation
as
your
honor
knows
of
course
is
in
terms
of
the
direct
diversion
down
--
down
the
canal.
the
--
the
commission
just
to
take
another
minute
to
--
to
outline
the
steps
which
they
have
taken
in
order
to
get
themselves
get
--
get
itself
ready
to
serve
these
communities,
the
commission
set
about
after
it
--
it
entered
into
these
contracts
set
about
getting
all
the
permits
that
were
necessary
and
did
get
a
permit
from
united
states
corps
of
engineers
and
the
department
of
public
works
of
illinois,
the
state
sanitary
water
board,
the
village
of
glen
cove
all
that
permits
which
the
complaint
alleges
were
needed.
the
commission
also
adopted
an
ordinance
for
the
issuance
and
sale
of
more
than
$18
million
principal
amount
of
water
revenue
bonds
and
contracted
to
sell
such
bonds
to
a
group
of
investment
bankers.
but
before
the
bonds
could
be
sold
and
their
delivery
consummated,
the
state
of
michigan,
in
the
early
part
of
october
1958,
through
its
attorney
general,
directed
a
letter
to
the
commission
a
copy
which
is
included
in
our
motion
for
leave
to
file,
which
stated
that
unless
the
commission
desisted
from
its
intention
of
diverting
water
from
the
great
lakes
basin,
the
state
of
michigan
intended
to
institute
such
proceedings
as
might
be
necessary
to
protect
what
it
called
its
interest,
“for
the
halting
of
the
your
propose
abstraction
of
water
from
the
great
lakes.”
mr.
charles
a.
bane
it
was
early
october
9,
1958,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
it
was
after
the
dispatch
of
letters
through
the
governor.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
i
think
it
was
--
i
think
that's
not
unfair.
it
was
an
offer
of
negotiation
and
actually
there
were
negotiations,
your
honor,
after
the
letters
were
received.
trips
were
made
by
representatives
of
the
attorney
general's
office
in
illinois
to
lansing
and
to
detroit
and
an
attempt
to
sit
down
to
work
the
matter
out.
but
as
you
can
gather
from
our
presence
here,
it
has
not
been
worked
out.
we
--
the
commission
received
not
only
a
letter
from
michigan,
but
also
received
one
shortly
after
the
michigan
letter
from
ohio
through
its
attorney
general
and
then
also
from
pennsylvania,
through
its
deputy
attorney
general.
and
there
were
indications
at
a
point
in
these
conferences
that
were
taking
place
that
the
other
states
which
illinois
has
joined
in
this
action,
minnesota,
new
york,
and
wisconsin
would
take
similar
action.
i
wouldn't
mislead
the
court,
however
and
there
had
not
been
formal
letters
of
protest
against
this
commission's
action
by
those
latter
--
those
latter
three
states.
but
there
were
the
formal
letters
of
protest
by
the
three
states
of
michigan,
wisconsin
--
michigan
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
ohio
and
pennsylvania.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
investment
bankers
determined
that
they
were
unable
to
proceed
and
the
result
is
that
this
project
of
the
elmhurst
commission
has
now
been
effectively
stopped
as
a
result
of
the
letters
and
the
threats
of
--
of
these
other
three
regulated
states.
and
that
is
the
point
which
we
stand
now.
there
was
a
period
during
which
we
attempt
to
negotiate
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
of
that
having
falling
through
it
seem
to
us
that
we
have
no
alternative
except
to
seek
relief
through
an
original
action
in
this
court
and
we
accordingly
filed
our
motion
for
leave.
now
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
outline
three
basis
on
which
illinois
believes
that
it
has
set
forth
a
cause
of
action
in
its
complaint
anyone
of
which
we
believe
is
--
is
persuasive
in
determining
illinois'
rights
in
this
--
in
this
respect.
the
approach
which
this
court
has
been
taking
on
problems
of
allocation
of
water
has
been
that
of
what
is
known
as
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
which
has
been
applied
by
this
court
in
proceedings
involving
states
whether
those
states
are
western
states
following
internally
the
doctrine
of
prior
appropriation
or
whether
those
states
are
middle
western
and
eastern
states
which
generally
follow
the
doctrine
of
riparian
rights.
in
either
case,
without
regard
to
what
type
of
state
you
may
be
dealing
with
so
far
as
local
internal
water
rights
determination
are
concern,
this
court
has
approached
the
problem
as
being
one
of
equitable
apportionment.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
amicus
filed
here
has
been
in
agreement
that
that
has
been
the
approach
of
this
court
and
the
decisions
clearly
show
the
point
the
two
most
important
ones
that
this
court
knows
being
connecticut
against
massachusetts
having
to
do
with
the
diversion
of
the
waters
of
the
swift
delaware
into
the
boston
area
and
new
jersey
against
new
york
having
to
do
with
the
diversion
of
delaware
waters
into
the
hudson
river
watershed
for
new
york
city.
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
under
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
have
in
some
case
has
been
hard
cases.
and
new
jersey
against
new
york
with
such
a
case,
there
was
great
need
on
the
new
york
side
and
yet
there
also
was
a
prospect
of
substantial
and
serious
harm
downstream
to
the
sovereign
states
of
the
rights
of
the
sovereign
states
of
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey.
and
the
result
was
that
this
court's
decree
in
that
case
was
protective
of
those
downstream
rights
by
imposing
certain
restrictions
upon
new
york
in
a
way
of
requiring
certain
measures
to
be
taken
for
the
maintenance
of
flow
and
low
water
periods
and
the
like
so
as
to
minimize
the
harm
downstream,
balance
that
with
the
benefits
to
be
achieved
by
the
taking
by
new
york
thereby
achieving
a
true
division
in
accordance
with
equitable
apportionment.
that's
the
type
of
hard
case
we
say
which
this
court
has
had.
this
case
we
think
is
no
such
hard
case.
primarily,
because
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
really
doesn't
have
to
be
brought
into
play
unless
you've
prove
damage.
it's
when
you
have
damages
on
the
one
side
that
you
have
to
line
up
that
disadvantages
the
harm
on
that
side
as
against
the
benefits
on
the
other
and
having
line
those
up,
then
the
court
has
to
reach
its
conclusions
as
to
where
it
thinks
the
equitable
apportionment
of
the
line.
but
here,
there
is
no
damage
this
taking
of
25
to
30
cubic
feet
per
second
from
the
lake
producing
an
imperceptible
effect
on
the
lake
is
going
to
produce
no
damage
of
any
kind
to
the
other
great
lakes
states.
and
consequently,
we
maintain
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
really
has
no
place
here,
because
there
isn't
anything
which
you
have
to
line
up
in
the
way
of
detriment
to
the
other
states
against
these
benefits
and
this
urgent
need
of
our
communities
for
this
water
which
we're
proposing
to
take.
but
even
if
you
did
consider
that
the
doctrine
was
--
was
to
be
applicable,
it
is
clear
and
you
have
established
in
connecticut
against
massachusetts
that
the
taking
of
water
for
the
purposes
for
which
we
are
proposing
to
take
it
is
the
highest
possible
use
to
which
water
can
be
devoted.
taking
of
water
for
drinking
and
domestic
purposes,
this
court
said,
is
the
highest
possible
use.
and
that
being
so,
if
you
take
on
the
one
hand
the
fact
that
we
are
taking
water
for
the
highest
possible
use
and
we
have
an
urgent
need
for
it,
that
it
would
certainly
seem
clear
to
us
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
reapportionment
would
require
that
you
approve
the
allocation
of
this
amount
of
water.
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well
sir,
there's
no
way
in
which
we
could
take
advantage
of
that
water
itself.
i
mean,
i
--
i
appreciate
that
you're
probably
referring
to
a
general
taking
from
the
lake.of
course,
the
1500
cubic
feet
is
being
diverted
directly
down
the
chicago
river
and
sanitary
canal.
that
has
--
that
--
that
we
couldn't
get
at.
there
just
no
--
there
is
just
no
way
in
which
it
would
be
any
physical
facilities,
and
of
course
that
--
that
becomes
a
--
that
becomes
a
part
of
the
illinois
waterway
into
which
the
sanitary
district
is
just
discharging
its
effluent.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well
sir
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well
the
engineers
your
honor
explored
every
possible
alternative.
and
the
alternatives
really,
i
think,
as
i
indicate
it
to
justice
brennan
are
to
go
to
chicago
directly
for
--
for
water
in
which
case,
you're
still
going
for
lake
michigan
water
or
to
go
directly
to
the
lake
itself
which
is
what
these
communities
did.
actually
the
--
just
to
give
a
little
of
the
circumstance,
the
--
the
happenstance
that
there
was
a
--
a
rather
long
line
of
--
of
chicago
and
northwestern
railroad
available
for
transmission
line
was
a
very
happy
circumstance
here.
it
made
it
simple
to
cut
across
country
with
a
transmission
lane,
i
say
across
country
actually,
these
are
build
up
areas
to
cut
across
with
the
transmission
lane
so
that
--
that
would
have
been
--
that
proved
to
be
or
the
engineers
concluded
that
that
was
the
--
the
sensible
way
really
in
which
to
do
this.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
sir
if
we
--
if
chicago
were
to
furnish
it,
i
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
would
simply
add
on.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
chicago
in
turn,
i
think
would
take
a
little
more
from
the
lake.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
depends
on
whether
these
southern
great
lake
states
would
then
protest
to
chicago
for
that
imperceptible,
small,
low
amount
of
additional
taking
that
chicago
would
take.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
i
think
it
depends
on
how
you
would
interpret
your
1930
decree.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
you
--
you
have
entered
a
decree
with
respect
to
chicago
actually
of
course
it
runs
to
the
state
of
illinois
and
its
employees
and
agents
in
which
you
have
said
that
illinois
is
to
be
allowed
to
take
for
that
direct
diversion
purposes
beginning
in
1938,
1500
cubic
feet
in
addition
to
domestic
pumpage.
it
would
certainly
seem
to
be
a
recognition
of
chicago's
rights
to
take
for
domestic
pumpage.
actually,
we
maintain
that
that
decree
in
wisconsin
against
illinois
constitutes
a
precedent
for
a
taking
for
domestic
pumpage
purposes
without
limitation.
and
the
language
of
the
decree
is
broad
enough,
your
honor,
so
that
it's
not
really
confined
simply
to
that
taking
for
that
particular
purpose.
and
it
--
and
therefore
be
argued
that
there
is
a
general
right
established
by
that
decree
in
illinois
to
take
water
for
domestic
pumpage.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well
we
are
face
of
course
here,
with
these
threats
which
we
have
received
from
the
other
great
lakes
states.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes.
we
--
we
don't
really
claim
that
the
1930
decree
is
res
judicata
or
determinative.
we
--
we
really
take
the
position
i
think
that
that's
a
precedent
in
favor
of
this
kind
of
taking.
if
we
had
tried
to
raise
this
question
in
the
1930
decree
and
of
course
we
--
we
appreciate
that
at
the
port
of
the
decree,
there
is
a
general
reservation
whereby
the
decree
can
be
reopened.
but
if
illinois
had
attempted
in
that
proceeding
to
raise
this
question,
we'd
be
in
a
kind
of
an
anomalous
position
i
think,
attempting
to
raise
there
something
which
we
claim
really
has
--
has
already
been
established
as
a
precedent.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
no.
we
wouldn't
have
adopted
this
method.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
we
probably
would
have
assumed
unless
there
had
been
protest.
incidentally
when
i
say
that
these
communities
could
have
become
a
part
of
chicago,
something
would
have
to
be
done
about
the
intervening
areas
as
well,
your
honor,
because
there
has
to
be
contiguousness
for
annexation.
but,
assuming
that
all
of
that
has
been
taken
care
of,
we
would
--
i
--i
assume
that
these
communities
then
would
have
--
would
have
made
their
arrangements
when
their
wells
began
to
run
dry
for
a
taking
of
chicago
water.
but
i
think
it's
entirely
possible
that
these
great
lakes
state
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
would
have
protested
in
exactly
the
same
way,
yes,
sir,
because
it's
lake
michigan
water
that
we're
talking
about
no
matter
how
you
--
how
you
take
it.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
so
far
as
we
know,
your
honor,
there
has
been
no
protest.
no.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
they
are
being
served
with
chicago
water
which
is
lake
michigan
--
michigan.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
no,
sir,
they
are
not.
i
think,
generally
speaking,
when
we
--
when
there
is
--
when
the
--
when
statistics
are
presented
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
water
that's
being
taken
for
domestic
pumpage
purposes
and
these
statistics
are
of
course
in
numbers
2,
3
and
4
which
are
--
which
is
before
your
--
before
the
court
on
a
petition
by
the
--
of
the
great
lakes
states
for
reopening.
the
1700
cubic
feet
per
second
which
is
taken
as
chicago's
taking
is
of
course
--
it
--
it
does
include
the
amounts
which
chicago
takes
for
supply
to
these
other
communities.
so
that
i
think
that
there's
a
general
recognition
that
chicago
is
doing
that
for
the
other
communities
and
account
is
taken
in
the
figures
of
how
much
--
of
--
of
what
is
supplied
to
the
other
communities.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
--
it
is
included
within
the
1700.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that's
my
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
it's
with
--
it's
the
same
thing,
your
honor,
yes.
but,
statistics
are
often
presented
as
to
what
it
is
that
chicago
is
taking
for
domestic
purposes.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
and
usually
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
we
are
trying
to
use
the
same
basis,
your
honor.
what
--
what
we're
--
what
we're
trying
to
do
however
is
not
to
get
ourselves
--
not
to
get
this
proceeding
into
that
proceeding.
and
actually
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
exactly.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
of
course,
sir.
of
course.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
we
maintain
that.
but
we
may
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
these
are
not
for
chicago's
use,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
no
sir.
no,
sir.
they
are
not.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
they
are
separate
municipalities
but
they
are
supplied
by
chicago.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
so,
it
has
been
assumed
evidently
and
there's
been
no
protest.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
if
--
if
these
three
communities
made
an
arrangement
for
taking
water
from
chicago,
we
assume
that
then
--
then
that
would
be
embodied
within
the
terms
of
domestic
pumpage
as
authorized
for
chicago.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
your
honor,
i
may
have
misled
you.
the
1700
cubic
feet
hasn't
been
established
as
a
limitation.
that's
just
a
statistic
which
gets
mentioned
as
to
the
amount
which
chicago
is
taking
for
domestic
pumpage
purposes.
there
is
no
limitation
established
anywhere
on
what
chicago
takes
for
domestic
pumpage.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
the
decree
does
not
limit
it
to
chicago,
no.
paragraphs
one,
two
and
three
of
the
decree
run
to
the
state
of
illinois.
what
they
do
is
establish
the
amount
which
shall
be
taken
by
direct
diversion
and
establishes
a
certain
amount
your
honor
for
the
--
for
the
first
beginning
years
after
the
day
of
the
decree,
then
another
amount,
and
then
it
gets
down
to
the
1500
cubic
feet
for
direct
diversion.
that's
water
that's
being
diffused
to
flush
out
the
water
waste
in
effect.
but
in
each
case,
the
decree
says
that
that
amount
which
is
authorized
is
in
addition
to
domestic
pumpage.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
we
maintain
--
that
is
the
needs
of
illinois,
your
honor,
yes.
and
that's
why
we
say
that
the
decree
in
wisconsin
against
illinois
which
is
the
title
of
the
--
this
proceeding
in
which
the
decree
was
entered,
we
say
that
that
decree
does
in
fact
constitute
a
precedent
and
a
recognition
by
this
court
that
illinois
is
entitled
to
take
from
lake
michigan
water
for
domestic
purposes.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
correct,
sir.
we
believe
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
it's
primarily
an
engineering
matter,
your
honor.
but
of
course,
you
understand
that
the
need
doesn't
for
these
communities
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
it
began
to
develop
that
the
wells
were
inadequate.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
if
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
the
power
to
supply
does
not
know.
but
actually,
when
the
problem
came
to
be
considered,
it
was
--
it
was
not
chicago
that
came
to
consider
it,
it
was
these
three
communities.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
they
had
the
problem.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
we
could
have
done
so.
but
we
--
on
our
statute
books,
we
had
authorized
community
such
as
this
to
form
a
water
commission
if
they
wanted
to,
to
go
to
a
common
source
of
supply.
that
authorization
of
course
didn't
refer
to
lake
michigan.
it's
a
--
it's
a
statute
that
operates
throughout
the
state.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
our
position.
i
will
only
have
to
it
if
i
may,
that
these
communities
discovered
when
they
--
when
they
set
about
to
face
the
problem,
they
discovered
that
there
was
no
source
of
water
available
for
them
except
lake
michigan
and
not
other
sources.
now,
they
did
have
an
alternative
of
turning
to
chicago
or
going
directly
and
decided
that
they
would
go
directly.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
is
our
position,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
your
honor,
illinois
takes
the
position
here
that
nothing
that's
being
proposed
here
raises
any
great
tremendous
problem
which
is
going
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
we
--
we
couldn't
help
but
agree,
that
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
indications
or
probabilities
that
numerous
other
communities
in
illinois
were
going
to
becoming
or
taking
advantage
of
these
authorizing
statutes
and
do
the
same
type
of
thing
that
these
communities
are
proposing
here.
we
couldn't
help
but
agree
that
that
might
create
a
problem
that
had
to
be
--
that
had
to
be
studied.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
of
course
it
is.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
of
course,
it
is.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
but,
your
honor,
there's
just
isn't
any
indication
that
any
communities
other
than
these
are
--
are
concerned
with
this
type
of
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
but,
your
honor,
there
are
certain
physical
limitations
that
are
going
to
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
--
prevent
municipalities
from
turning
to
the
great
--
turning
to
the
great
lakes.
they
have
other
resources
just
as
our
communities
west
of
chicago
go
to
--
turn
to
the
fox
river
which
is
about
40
to
50
miles
inland
from
the
lake.
communities
aren't
going
to
engage
in
the
great
tremendous
investments
that
are
required
to
go
to
the
lake
unless
that
is
absolutely
the
only
alternative
that
they
have,
and
that
is
the
case
here.
there
wouldn't
have
been
this
expenditure
of
$18
million
or
a
proposal
to
expend
that
amount,
unless
it
was
determined
that
there
just
wasn't
any
source
of
water
except
lake
michigan.
but
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
one
matter
on
which
i
would've
like
to
have
commented.
it
has
to
do
with
the
position
which
the
great
lakes
states
have
taken
with
respect
to
the
requirement
that
we
return
our
effluent,
but
illinois
is
anxious
to
reserve
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
and
therefore,
if
the
court
please,
i
wonder
if
i
might
just
state
and
--
and
reiterate
without
being
repetitive,
that
this
is
an
urgent
need
for
these
communities
that
illinois
is
--
is
in
good
faith
here
when
it
is
arguing
that
these
wells
in
these
communities
are
proven
to
be
inadequate
and
that
we
have
90,000
people
in
the
northern
part
of
our
state
whose
sanitary
and
drinking
water
needs
are
imperil
and
who
are
imperil
with
everyday
that
--
that
passes
even
the
beginning
--
even
when
this
project
has
begun.
it
is
going
to
take
about
two
years
for
it
to
be
completed.
and
during
that
period,
these
communities
are
going
to
be
at
the
risk
of
some
adverse
developments
with
respect
to
its
--
to
their
wells
which
may
greatly
imperil
the
safety
and
welfare
of
the
community.
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
have
urged
upon
this
court
and
we
are
sorry
to
bother
you
but
we
have
urged
upon
this
--
this
court
by
various
motions
of
the
immediacy
of
our
need
and
the
urgency
of
the
situation
here.
we
would
like
to
stress
it.
we
think
we've
demonstrated
in
the
briefs
that
we
do
have
these
rights
that
we
are
not
causing
damage
that
under
the
doctrines
which
this
court
has
announced
that
we
are
entitled
to
take.
we
would
like
to
reserve,
your
honor,
and
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
would
be
most
appreciative
if
the
court
would
permit
mr.
wines
to
conduct
the
rebuttal
for
the
state
when
the
time
comes.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
by
that,
i
meant
that
we
would
--
we
would
not
like
to
see
the
court
consolidate
this
proceeding
with
numbers
2,
3
and
4.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
primarily,
on
the
basis
of
this
matter
of
urgency,
we,
of
course,
don't
know
what
the
court
is
going
to
do
with
number
2,
3
and
--
numbers
2,
3
and
4
on
the
petition
for
reopening.
it
--
we
--
we
believe
that
there
are
issues
there
involving
sanitation
and
navigation
and
the
problems
of
direct
diversion
which
however
they
are
worked
out,
are
not
the
problems
of
this
proceeding.
and
so
though,
it's
the
state
of
illinois
that's
involved
in
each
case,
no,
it's
lake
michigan
water
that's
involved
in
each
case,
we
think
that
the
circumstances
justifying
the
taking
are
so
completely
different
in
each
case
that
we
believe
this
ought
to
be
kept
separate.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
you
mean
determine
that
--
determine
it
once
and
for
all,
your
honor,
as
if
we
have
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
mr.
charles
a.
bane
i
--
i
don't
have
any
doubt
that
the
great
lakes
states
would
want
to
and
ought
to
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
answer.
but
once
we
have
granted
motion
for
leave,
we
wouldn't
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
we
believe
so.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
we
believe
so.
only
legal
questions
that
the
questions
of
fact
would
be
clear
and
in
fact,
we
believe
the
court
could
act
then
if
they
were
pending
before
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
on
a
motion
for
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
the
nonavailability
of
other
sources.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir,
because
we
just
don't
believe
that
those
--
that
those
can
be
quarreled
with,
those
allegations.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
the
court
ought
answer
that.
and
--
and
actually,
it
--
it
doesn't
go
to
the
root
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
--
it
doesn't
go
to
the
root
of
the
problem
mr.
charles
a.
bane
i
think
it's
because
it's
what
this
court
called
--
well,
in
philadelphia
tried
to
get
into
the
new
york
against
new
jersey
situation,
this
court
deniably
for
philadelphia
to
intervene
and
said
it
wasn't
going
to
be
concerned
with
intramural
problems.
i
think
that
was
the
adjective
that
was
used.
and
i
think
that,
what
--
what
you
have
to
be
concerned
with
is
whether
we
establish
a
right
or
can
establish
a
right
to
take
from
the
lake.
but
the
question
whether
--
whether
illinois
can
take
from
the
lake
for
these
communities
under
their
circumstances,
but
whether
they
should
take
from
the
lake
by
way
of
chicago
or
by
going
up
directly
to
glen
cove,
north
of
chicago,
that
is
certainly
not
an
issue
which
this
court
ought
to
be
called
upon
to
determine.
mr.
charles

bane
sir
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
but
sir,
in
facing
to
that
question,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
have
to
face
the
question
of
whether
these
communities
should
take
through
chicago
or
take
otherwise.
you
do
face
the
question
of
whether
these
communities,
illinois
on
behalf
of
these
communities
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
the
lake
or
whether
they
should
do
it
through
chicago
or
not
seems
to
me
to
be
an
intramural
matter.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
well,
it's
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
--
mr.
charles
a.
bane
--
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
no,
sir.
certainly
not.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
bane
that
might
make
a
difference.
and
of
course
from
their
point
of
view
the
--
that's
the
desirable
alternative.
