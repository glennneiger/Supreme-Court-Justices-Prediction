mr.
paul
l.
adams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
complainant
has
quoted
in
its
brief
the
words
of
justice
holmes,
“a
river
is
more
than
an
amenity,
it
is
a
treasure.
it
offers
a
necessity
of
life
that
must
be
rationed
among
those
who
have
power
over
it.”
we
believe
the
words
of
the
justice
might
properly
be
paraphrased
for
application
to
our
present
problem
as
follows.
the
great
lakes
are
more
than
an
amenity.
they
are
a
national,
yes,
even
an
international
treasure.
they
offer
a
necessity
of
life
that
must
be
conserved
among
those
who
have
power
over
them.
we
propose
to
show
that
the
actions
of
michigan
throughout
and
its
position
today
is
not
one
of
adamant
denial
to
another
state
of
the
use
of
this
great
resource,
but
rather
there
any
use
shall
be
reasonable
and
in
keeping
with
the
utmost
possible
preservation
of
the
resource
for
co-users
whether
they'd
be
sister
states
or
a
friendly
foreign
power.
to
this
and
may
i
review
briefly
the
history
of
this
present
controversy?
on
december
19th,
1957,
governor
williams
of
michigan
wrote
governor
stratton
of
illinois
expressing
his
concern
and
seeking
information
over
what
appeared
to
be
a
new
diversion
of
water
from
the
great
lakes.
his
letter
enclosed
a
copy
of
a
letter
of
the
attorney
general
of
a
state
of
michigan
expressing
the
opinion
that
the
contemplated
diversion
would
be
a
violation
of
the
decree
of
the
supreme
court
dated
april
21,
1930.
no
reply
was
ever
received
to
this
letter.
again,
on
march
11,
governor
williams
wrote
governor
stratton
to
reiterate
his
concern
over
any
diversion
from
the
great
lakes
basin.
no
reply
was
received
to
this
letter.
on
october
the
9th,
1958,
the
governor
of
the
sovereign
state
of
michigan,
having
twice
failed
to
receive
a
response
of
the
governor
of
illinois,
an
information
having
come
to
me
of
the
organization
of
a
water
commission
that
proposed
to
serve
the
domestic
and
industrial
needs
of
three
inland,
non-riparian
villages.
i
did
write
the
letter
a
copy
of
which
is
a
pendant
to
complainant's
motion
for
a
leave
to
file
a
complaint.
again,
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
michigan,
i
objected
to
the
apparent
attempt
not
to
use
but
to
divert
the
waters
of
the
great
lakes
from
the
great
lakes
basin
to
the
mississippi
watershed.
now,
may
i
say
that
in
attempting
to
deal
with
this
controversy,
the
state
of
michigan
has
found
itself
faced
with
an
enigma
or
perhaps
i
should
say,
with
a
case
of
schizophrenia
for
we
have
attempted
to
deal
with
the
state
of
illinois
and
we
found
ourselves
ignored,
forced
to
turn
our
attention
to
the
water
commission.
and
if
we
attempted
to
deal
with
the
water
commission,
then
we
found
ourselves
sued
by
the
state
of
illinois.
we
the
defendants
feel
that
we
are
faced
with
alternative
situations,
each
of
which
presents
its
own
legal
problems
and
issues.
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
suit
brought
in
reality
by
the
water
commission,
then
the
issues
as
we
view
then
becomes
as
follows.
the
state
of
illinois
is
not
the
real
party
and
interest.
the
complainant
--
the
complaint
does
not
present
a
justiciable
controversy
between
states.
no
actual
controversy
or
case
exists.
developed
complaint
shows
neither
juridical
right
nor
injury.
the
federal
declaratory
act
is
not
applicable.
well
a
co-counsel
for
wisconsin,
new
york
and
pennsylvania
will
address
their
attention
to
these
issues.
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
suit
brought
in
truth
by
the
state
of
illinois,
then
we
believe
the
following
issues
become
pertinent.
before
entertaining
jurisdiction
of
this
court
as
a
precondition
require
that
a
good
faith
effort
be
made
by
the
states
themselves
to
settle
their
dispute.
require
that
the
complainant's
state
make
a
clearer
prima
facie
showing
that
the
relief
it
seeks
is
truly
to
meet
a
present
crisis
in
domestic
usage.
mr.
paul
l.
adams
i
would
like
to
review
those
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
second
point
that
the
complainant
state
make
a
clearer
prima
facie
showing
that
the
relief
it
seeks
is
truly
to
meet
a
present
crisis
and
domestic
usage
not
for
industrial
development
or
future
domestic
needs
or
in
lieu
of
some
other,
well
perhaps
more
expensive
method
of
providing
water.
secondly,
that
if
the
court
does
entertain
jurisdiction,
then
it
should
take
cognizance
of
the
whole
controversy
between
the
respective
parties
as
it
fits
a
suit
between
quasi
sovereign.
and
thirdly,
that
if
this
court
takes
jurisdiction,
it
should
direct
its
attention
and
concern
to
the
preservation
of
the
great
lakes
basin
rather
than
to
a
division
or
apportionment
of
this
great
national
and
international
treasure.
one,
before
entertaining
jurisdiction,
the
court
should
require
that
a
good
faith
effort
be
made
by
the
states
themselves
to
settle
their
dispute.
on
march
the
6th,
1959,
i
suggested
a
conference
to
discuss
problems
of
diversion
at
the
suggestion
of
a
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states.
on
march
16th,
1959,
the
then
attorney
general
of
illinois,
attorney
general
castle,
replied
to
me
that,
and
i
quote,
“illinois
is
entitled
to
take
the
domestic
pumpage
from
the
lakes
without
returning
any
part
thereof
to
lake
michigan.”
and
that
this
was
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
well
is
perfectly
willing
to
confer
this
was
the
position
that
the
state
would
maintain.
i
realized
that
the
complainant
claims
good
faith
that
i
submit
that
this
type
of
position
or
to
cite
another
example
that
an
offer
to
negotiate
on
the
basis
that
the
only
negotiation
would
be
the
withdrawal
of
the
objections
of
the
complainant
states
is
not
good
faith
negotiation
or
an
attempt
between
the
states
to
settle
these
issues.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
under
the
contract
clause
or
the
federal
constitution,
under
principles
of
international
law,
full
disclosure,
negotiation,
inquiry,
mediation,
conciliation
and
other
peaceful
means
are
the
course
that
should
be
adopted
first
before
the
jurisdiction
of
this
high
tribunal
is
invoked.
the
court
should
cause
the
complainant
to
make
a
clearer
prima
facie
showing
that
the
relief
it
seeks
is
to
meet
a
present
crisis
in
domestic
usage,
not
for
industrial
development
or
future
domestic
needs
or
in
lieu
of
some
other
perhaps
more
expensive
method
of
providing
water.
this
water
commission
proposes
to
serve,
and
this
is
from
their
own
motion,
the
city
of
elmhurst,
the
villages
of
villa
park,
lombard,
addison,
bensenville,
elk
grove
and
industrial
users,
pages
9
and
10
of
the
complainant's
motion.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
affidavit
of
ralph
a.
smith
will
not
stand
careful
analysis
and
scrutiny.
he
states,
“during
recent
years,
the
increasing
consumption
of
water
in
domestic
and
industrial
users
is
beginning
to
exceed
the
water
supply
available
through
underground
sources.”
page
5,
motion
to
advance.
and
joseph
f.
collin,
the
other
affiant,
uses
the
same
identical
language
in
the
body
of
his
affidavit.
and
both
of
these
men
say
and
summing
out
and
i'm
trying
to
justify
this
action
the
following.
due
to
the
increase
need
for
water,
they
do
not
say,
“water
for
what?”
they
merely
say,
“due
to
the
increase
need
for
water.”
a
real
danger
exists
that
the
well
supplies
may
diminish
within
the
next
few
years
to
the
point
where
a
serious
shortage
will
exist.
i
submit
that
these
affidavits
do
not
provide
a
proper
foundation
for
action
by
this
court.
know
well
that
their
faced
assertion
of
the
complainant
that
there
is
no
other
source
of
water
supply
in
the
area
except
lake
michigan.
but
this
plains
and
parks
rivers
cannot
be
explained
the
way
by
saying,
and
again
i
quote,
“they
do
not
have
sufficient
flow
or
wholesomeness
of
quality
of
water
to
serve
these
communities.”
on
the
second
point,
if
the
court
does
take
jurisdiction,
it
should
take
cognizance
of
the
whole
controversy.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general,
that
a
state
has
a
real
interest,
quasi
sovereign
in
character
in
all
the
earth,
water
and
air
within
its
domain.
and
if
the
present
suit
were
bought
to
determine
all
the
relative
rights
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
waters
of
lake
michigan,
we
would
take
no
exception
to
the
solicitor
general's
position.
in
a
suit
between
quasi
sovereigns,
all
rights
should
be
adjudicated
in
a
single
or
in
consolidated
action.
we
agreed
that
this
controversy
might
well
be
likened
to
a
boundary
dispute.
but
we
insist,
look
at
the
whole
boundary.
do
not
attempt
to
settle
the
dispute
an
inch
at
a
time.
and
as
a
final
point
which
admittedly
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
controversy
but
which
is
discussed
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
terms
of
equitable
apportionment,
we
contend
that
the
prime
--
that
the
prime
concern
of
the
court
and
of
all
the
lakes
states
should
be
the
preservation
not
the
division
of
the
waters
of
the
great
lakes.
we
contend
that
is
not
possible
for
this
court
equitably
or
in
any
other
way
to
apportion
the
waters
of
the
great
lakes
as
between
illinois
and
canada.
we
contend
that
the
right
of
navigation
is
a
paramount
national
right
that
would
be
affected
if
illinois
is
permitted
to
divert
unilaterally
even
30
cfs.
this
is
a
measurable
diversion.
it
amounts
to
three
one
hundredths
of
an
inch.
this
is
in
terms
of
the
need
of
only
90,000
people.3
3
and
one-third
times,
three
one
hundredths
of
an
inch
equals
one
inch.
one
inch
equals
1,500,000
tons
of
shipping
annually.
certainly,
the
needs
and
use
of
an
early
40,000,000
people
in
the
great
lakes
area
demand
the
most
careful
preservation
of
this
national
resource.
it
is
not
enough
to
assert
that
some
solution
to
the
overall
problem
will
be
found
by
impounding
excess
water
during
wet
years
when
the
lake
cycle
is
high.
and
thereby,
provide
additional
water
during
drought
years.
such
a
solution
is
being
and
has
in
the
past
been
sought
by
the
u.s.
corps
of
engineers
but
it
has
not
yet
been
achieved.
in
the
meantime,
the
only
proper
and
sensible
rule
is
once
of
reasonable
use
of
as
little
diminution
as
possible
of
return
to
the
--
to
this
treasure,
to
this
common
pool
of
that
which
is
taken
from
it.
this
has
been
the
policy
of
all
the
lake
states
except
illinois.
if
this
court
sanctions
taking
by
unilateral
action,
the
result
can
be
either
endless
litigation
on
a
peace
meal
basis
or
constant
repeated
injury
to
the
great
lakes
states,
to
the
paramount
navigational
interest
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
rights
of
canada.
