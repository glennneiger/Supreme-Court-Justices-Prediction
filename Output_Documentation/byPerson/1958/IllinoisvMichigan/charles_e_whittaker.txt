mr.
bane
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
may
i
ask
you
please?
i'm
sure
i
do
not
understand
you.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
withdrawal
of
an
additional
1000
cubic
feet
per
second
would
have
an
effect
upon
the
lake
level
of
five
eights
of
an
inch.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you'd
said
that
that
was
not
annual.
now,
i
don't
understand
is
that
to
be
the
immediate
effect
of
the
withdrawal
of
that
much
water?
how
is
it
to
be
use
to
be
supplied?
how
--
how
do
you
get
to
the
idea
that
--
that
the
withdrawal
of
1000
feet
--
cubic
feet
per
second
would
affect
the
lake
level
only
five
eights
of
an
inch
permanently?
i
don't
see,
i
don't
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
quite
obvious,
isn't
it,
that
the
use
of
1000
feet
per
second
would
not
in
standard
reduce
the
level
of
lake
michigan
by
five
eights
of
an
inch,
it
takes
some
time
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that's
the
maximum
that
would
--
the
--
of
the
reduction
and
applies
from
other
sources
would
prevent
it
going
lower
than
five
eights
of
an
inch
over
permanent
usage,
is
that
what
we
understand?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
seek
the
right
to
use
25
to
30
cubic
feet
per
second.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
fact
what
is
limited
upon
the
service
by
the
decree
to
limits
of
chicago?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
couldn't.
this
domestic
pumpage
is
the
--
is
that
in
your
recording,
domestic
pumpage
was
then
of
the
city
of
chicago
or
the
needs
of
illinois?
