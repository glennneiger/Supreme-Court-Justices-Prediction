these
are

may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
us
what
the
purpose
of
the
village
which
you
referred
in
suspending
in
congress?

sponsored
by
illinois?

what
is
the
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
diversion
sought
by
that
was
unrelated
to
what
illinois
is
contemplating
to
this
state,
is
that
right?
justice

frankfurter
except
that
you
want
1000
more
that
this
1930
decree
allows.
justice

that
canada
stated
the

could

when

--

--
(voice

i
think
--
justice

frankfurter
mr.
bane,
is
it
true
whether
there
maybe
other
illinois
municipalities
in
this
fix
were
about
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
additional

justice

--
but
not
additional

michigan
is
important.
would
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
beyond
the
--
the
allocated
amount.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
they
could
--
they
could
--
i
don't
think
there's
a
potential
supply
not
yet
use
by
chicago
which
could
be
drawn
from
it,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
limiting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
sorry,
what's
the
date
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
after
michigan
try
to
take
up
this
thing
by
way
of
negotiation
with
the
old
governor,
is
that
right?
justice

frankfurter
offered
negotiation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
unfair
technique?
justice
felix
frankfurter
chicago
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
cover
it,
would
--
would
chicago
have
to
obtain
permission
or
which
it
be
--
be
within
her
unkept
resources?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
is
my
question
mr.
bane.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question
if
i
may,
mr.
bane.
suppose
these
communities
which
i
understand
are
--
are
self-contained,
legally
self-contained
communities,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
part
of
the
municipality
of
that
for
the
state
of
chicago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
five
years
ago,
these
communities
had
in
fact
been
annexed
to
chicago
and
had
become
part
of
the
municipality
of
chicago,
would
--
that
would
have
been
possible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
wouldn't
have
taken
this
mode
of
getting
relief
for
those
communities
and
their
water
needs
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
would
you
have
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
protest
to
the
same
nature?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
for
chicago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
uses
are
not
for
chicago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
domestic
--
what
it
takes
for
domestic
purpose
is
a
function
of
its
need.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bane,
may
i
put
a
question
that,
we've
been
circling
around
at
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
can
put
it
briefly
and
you
can
--
i
know
you'll
be
able
to
answer
briefly,
as
i
understand
it,
you
said
you
agree
that
the
domestic
taking
is
not
defined
by
cubic
feet
but
is
a
function
of
the
needs
of
chicago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
despite
that
or
within
that
right
of
chicago,
she
may
service
communities
that
are
not
actually
part
of
the
chicago
municipality.
he
does,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
why
--
what
is
the
reason,
is
this
legal
or
engineering
for
some
other
combination
that
she
doesn't
service
these
three
communities
the
way
she
service
others
and
draw
underwater
which
is
entitled
to
draw
for
domestic
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
power
to
supply
doesn't
--
in
the
question
of
had
no
chronological
limitation,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
acted
on
their
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
had
the
problem,
but
you're
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
they
can
only
speak
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
could
you
--
could
you
not
determine
the
mode
by
which
their
needs
were
to
be
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
there
were
alternative
--
political,
i
mean
it's
not
an
ambiguous
one.
there
was
an
alternative
mode
of
dealing
with
this
problem
and
you
chose
and
illinois
to
let
these
communities
pull
their
political
interest
in
the
form
of
commission
and
you
come
here
as
of
right
under
your
view
to
ask
for
this
addition
of
diversion
under
the
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
determination
of
these
problems
is
irrelevant
whether
the
water
will
come
eventually
come
from
through
chicago
or
independently
to
these
communities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
court
can
decide
your
case
on
--
on
the
--
on
your
complaint
and
the
answer.in
other
words,
on
the
proceeding
you
turn
loosely
and
the
argument
before
it
that
adjudicates
the
issue
on
those
that
without
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
that
the
motion
is
granted
to
that,
it
is
allowed
to
be
filed,
assume
in
your
answer,
will
that
raise
any
legal
questions
for
adjudication
by
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
be
clear
as
to
the
amount,
it
has
to
the
urgency,
as
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
nonavailability
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
goes
to
all
that,
it
goes
a
--
determinable
have
to
answers
what
to
be
in
on
the
pleadings
of
in
this
general
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
personally
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
whether
--
you
said
the
court
should
not
answer
it.
is
it
because
it
is
--
it's
not
a
relevant
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
this
--
may
this
not
be
something
different
than
intramural
matter.this
commission,
is
that
an
independent
agency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
keep
them
as
active
and
self-contained
if
it
makes
its
own
determination
of
what
the
need
is,
how
much
to
take,
when
to
take,
enough
differences
of
supervision
of
chicago,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
if
they
have
--
if
chicago
would
have
to
service
these
communities,
it
would
be
chicago
determining
what
the
need
of
those
communities
are,
isn't
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
it
might
not
make
a
difference
that
is
the
commission
of
the
three
cities
that's
determining
but
rather
the
city
of
chicago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
banes,
i
understood
him
to
say
that
there
were
efforts
made
and
they
approved
the
subordinates
were
unsuccessfully.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
apply
didn't
you
say
they
have
the
right
to
use
it,
that
you
recognized
a
need
of
these
three
communities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you
--
did
you
recognize
their
needs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
would
not
be
a
contested
question
on
which
evidence
should
have
to
be
taken
and
submitted
by
you
in
behalf
of
wisconsin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
problem
congress
has
concerted
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
issue
of
need.
i
don't
mean
how
it
needs
something.
but
the
issue
of
need,
you
say,
you
recognized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
very
well.
you
answered
that.
so
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mrs.
forer,
i
take
it
--
if
i
may
say
so,
you're
objecting
to
what
illinois
is
asking
this
court
to
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
worrying
if
this
court
may
pronounce
a
wrong
legal
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that's
conclusive
on
what
you
can
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
difficulty
would
be
met
if
the
effluents
flow
returned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
expand
that
mrs.
forter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mrs.
forer,
as
i
understood
mr.
bane,
he
isn't
asking
this
court
to
announce
an
abstract
legal
proposition
but
on
riparian
claimant
or
applicant
has
the
right
to
tap
lake
waters.
illinois
comes
here
and
says
there
is
a
health
emergency
situation
and
the
way
to
meet
that
is
to
get
some
of
the
lake
waters.
and
if
there's
no
basis
for
that
and
there
is
no
basis
for
the
suit,
so
isn't
that
in
fact
a
legal
question
if
they'd
be
asking
us
to
announce?
i
follow
you
in
saying
that
if
you
grant
this
there'll
be
pressure
precedent
or
episode,
if
you
will,
have
a
way
of
multiplying
and
therefore
there
is
that
danger
or
all
the
consideration
for
circumscribing
and
carefully
scrutinizing
the
claim
that
there
is
an
emergency.
but
the
starting
point
is
not
an
abstract
theory
or
a
desire
to
establish
a
precedent
but
a
desire
or
a
compulsion
within
the
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
this
commission
is
a
commercial
enterprise
and
no
more,
are
not
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
your
--
would
your
position
be
different
if
instead
of
operating
through
especially
for
ad
hoc
commission
seeking
to
accomplish
this
water
need,
to
serve
these
water
needs
to
these
(inaudible)
the
thing
has
been
done
through
the
joint
arrangement
of
the
health
department,
whatever
they're
called,
of
the
three
political
units
apparently.
no
intervening
commission,
no
intervening
anything
except
the
regular
and
municipal
authorities
of
the
three
communities,
would
that
--
would
that
makes
the
case
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
would
ask
that?
does
that
mean
that
if
this
court
conditioned
the
relief
asked
by
illinois
with
the
duty
to
return
the
effluent
that
illinois
could
--
if
that
decree,
water
could
be
taken
and
that
qualification
of
the
decree
could
be
disobeyed
and
on
citation
for
an
intent
upon
it
and
it's
action
for
contempt,
would
it
be
a
good
answer
to
say
all
but
for
the
limited
corporation
would
be
ultra
vires
for
us
to
obey
this
court's
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
ultra
vires,
that's
potentiality
but
i
want
to
finish
that
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you
wouldn't
leave
canada's
interest
to
all
of
it
except
in
the
arrangement
among
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
add
to
the
--
everything
else?
in
addition,
to
mean
the
feasibility,
could
you
particularize
what
you
call
everything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
on
the
--
since
you've
opened
the
light
of
each
of
this
problem
as
--
i'd
like
to
ask
would
it
make
some
questions
dealing
with
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
problem
and
all
its
complexity
and
it's
evolutionary
weakness,
is
almost
half
century
old
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
it
certainly
began
before
the
government,
from
my
knowledge
in
1912.
justice
felix
frankfurter
1912
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
it
came
very
active.
that's
giving
about
half
a
century.
this
court
on
more
than
one
occasion
rather
--
in
rather
implicit
terms
indicated
that
while
of
course
access
may
be
had
and
must
be
responded
to
by
this
court
under
it's
original
jurisdiction
this
is
not
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
problem.
it
has
indicated
the
desirability
of
having
a
standing
body
of
--
standing
agency
which
will
reflect
the
changing
need
and
also
the
changing
and
growing
and
different
methods
of
responding
to
this
means.
a
minute
ago,
you
referred
to
the
interest
of
canada
in
a
protest.
thanks
to
my
brother
douglas,
i
have
read
the
full
text
of
that
note
of
april
9th.
the
very
stiff
note
joined
in
as
the
debate
showed
by
all
the
leaders
of
the
various
parties
in
canada.
but,
i
want
to
know
is
this,
with
this
long
preempt.
what
steps
if
any
have
been
taken
through
the
urging
or
the
nagging
or
the
stimulation
of
the
government
of
having
such
a
standing
body
established
among
the
states,
between
the
states
including
also
the
presence
of
canada
whether
if
these
--
these
things
will
be
brought
out
in
their
entirety
instead
of
the
almost
necessary,
limited,
and
sometimes
mutilated
way
in
which
a
litigation
decide
a
conference
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
standing,
administrative
mechanism
under
that
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
operating
the
way
the
canadian-american
joint
commission
has
been
operating?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
wondering
whether
the
development
of
the
fact
wouldn't
come
more
appropriately
or
more
effectively
with
inner
--
or
oversight
by
such
a
joint
body
than
by
this
appeal
to
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
it
breaks
down,
it
breaks
down
(inaudible)
a
litigation,
the
pathology
of
social
relations
and
where
the
court
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
canada
sit
in
on
this
compact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
arrangements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
one
thing
whether
they
can't,
another
thing
to
give
them
a
chance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
get
to
rather
shop
and
know
that,
i
mean
to
take
as
a
discredit,
it
wasn't
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they've
been
increasingly
feeling
it
as
you've
indicated
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
of
course,
the
thing
is
you
want
to
be
less
--
less
troublesome
in
the
future,
trying
to
be
more
troublesome,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
growth
of
population
and
a
new
seaway.
