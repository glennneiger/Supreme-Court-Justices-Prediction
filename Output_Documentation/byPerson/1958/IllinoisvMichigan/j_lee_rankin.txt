mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
of
america
has
a
great
interest
in
this
controversy.
it
has
an
interest
by
reason
of
the
navigational
facilities
in
the
great
lakes
and
the
saint
lawrence
seaway.
it
has
an
interest
because
of
the
hydroelectric
projects
that
had
been
developed
in
the
saint
lawrence
seaway
and
the
effect
of
any
diversion
of
water
on
that
hydroelectric
development.
it
also
has
an
interest
because
of
the
factor
of
pollution.
the
federal
government
through
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
has
a
great
interest
in
that
regard.
it
has
an
interest
because
of
these
states
and
the
fact
that
this
matter
has
become
a
source
of
controversy
and
irritation
between
them
and
the
united
states
thinks
that
it
is
an
interest
of
the
country
that
these
great
states
having
a
common
interest
in
this
great
resource
should
have
this
problem
resolved
and
should
be
working
on
their
common
interest
and
problems
and
not
be
involved
in
this
area
of
dispute
which
is
making
trouble
between
them.
it
also
has
a
great
interest
in
the
matter
because
of
the
international
situation
and
the
fact
that
our
great
neighbor
on
the
north
has
a
common
interest
with
this
--
in
this
great
resource,
our
common
activities
in
the
saint
lawrence
seaway,
and
the
whole
navigational
problem,
the
use
of
the
water
for
the
cities
and
communities
on
it.
we
have
carefully
examined
original
15
and
we
believe
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
that
the
complaint
should
be
allowed
to
be
filed,
that
the
case
should
be
considered
along
with
two,
three
and
four
together
so
that
the
whole
problem
could
be
properly
resolved.
but
there
is
no
question
of
what
this
court
has
the
power
to
enter
a
declaratory
judgment
as
in
the
original
action.
and
we
think
the
decisions
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
well
support
that.
the
basic
problem
in
this
case
involves
the
rights
of
the
riparian.
we
think
there
is
no
question
to
what
the
state
of
illinois
properly
represents
these
communities
as
water
users
within
the
state
in
this
litigation
and
that
any
decree
this
court
would
enter
would
bind
the
state
of
illinois.
and
if
they
want
to
divert
water
from
the
lake
of
michigan,
and
this
court
would
say
they
would
have
to
return
the
effluent
to
that
lake
as
a
condition.
the
state
of
illinois
would
have
to
abide
by
that
condition
and
every
water
user
within
the
state
that
was
--
and
that
the
state
was
acting
on
behalf
of
and
it
would
bind
it.
and
these,
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
that
very
clear.
in
fact
this
court
has
acted
in
the
past
to
say
that
water
users
themselves
were
not
proper
parties
in
the
litigation
of
this
character.
and
that
the
states
as
quasi
sovereigns
would
properly
before
in
trying
to
resolve
the
interest
of
their
water
users.
the
problem
we
have
is
the
question
of
the
diversion
of
water
out
of
the
watershed
by
riparian
interest.
and
the
basic
theory
of
riparian
water
has
always
been
if
you
take
water
out
and
you
put
it
back
less
the
consumptive
use.
and
therefore
the
common
interest
in
the
use
of
that
pool
of
water
is
injured
only
to
the
extent
of
the
actual
consumptive
use
and
no
more.
now
this
problem
presents
the
question
of
diverting
it
out
of
the
watershed
and
not
returning
it.
this
court
has
approved
that
type
of
action
in
two
different
matters
involving
riparian
waters
or
waters
where
the
riparian
doctrines
were
recognized
by
the
laws
of
the
states
that
were
involved.
one
was
the
case
of
the
city
of
boston
where
it
was
clearly
taken
out
of
the
watershed,
several
rivers,
and
devoted
to
the
use
of
the
city
of
boston
because
of
its
needs.
the
other
one
was
the
city
of
new
york,
new
jersey
against
new
york,
where
a
similar
provision
was
made.
and
we
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
it
very
clear
that
the
principle
equitable
apportionment
governs
in
these
conflicts
or
disputes
between
states
involving
matters
of
this
kind.
the
court
throughout
the
--
its
history
in
the
consideration
of
the
litigation
between
states
has
said
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
bound
by
special
rules
of
law
that
it
is
just
going
to
devote
itself
to
resolving
those
problems
by
the
law
of
what
is
fair,
just,
and
equitable
between
these
great
sovereigns
that
make
up
these
united
states.
and
that
is
the
consideration
that
we
think
the
court
must
turn
to
in
resolving
this
particular
question.
if
the
needs
are
found
upon
proper
trial
to
be
such
that
this
community
for
its
life
has
to
have
this
water,
and
it
can
be
fairly
and
just
to
be
done
under
equitable
principles,
then
we
think
this
court
has
the
power
to
say
that
it
can
be
diverted
even
out
of
the
watershed
and
it
will
not
return
to
the
lake.
that
is
a
problem
that
will
have
to
be
resolved
in
the
case
upon
a
hearing,
but
it's
not
involved
in
our
opinion
in
this
question
of
whether
the
complaint
is
properly
filed
or
should
be
allowed
to
be
filed
at
this
time.
now,
i
don't
want
to
argue
2,
3
and
4
before
you,
but
i
think
i
need
to
touch
upon
it
briefly
in
order
to
show
you
how
it's
related.
the
court
--
the
court,
members
of
court
have
asked
questions
about
whether
or
not
this
problem
could
be
solved
by
allowing
chicago
to
furnish
the
water.
the
united
states
does
not
think
that
solves
the
problem
because
this
is
out
of
the
watershed
and
there
isn't
as
we
read
the
decree
of
this
court
in
wisconsin
against
illinois,
there
is
not
anything
involving
the
supplying
of
water
as
domestic
pumpage
to
cities
or
communities
outside
of
the
watershed
to
be
--
and
diverted
for
that
purpose.
so
that
it
appears
to
us
that
the
decree
in
those
cases
contemplates
domestic
pumpage
entirely
as
water
that
would
be
used
within
the
watershed.
now,
it
does
provide
for
diversion
of
the
water
after
use
outside
of
the
watershed.
and
that's
why
i
think
i
need
to
deal
very
briefly
with
the
--
what
the
court
decided
in
the
earlier
decree
in
wisconsin
against
illinois.
the
court
will
recall
there
were
two
different
decisions.
one
was
by
chief
justice
taft
and
the
later
one
by
justice
holmes.
and
the
basic
principle
that
was
involved
was
that
the
city
of
chicago
over
a
term
of
years
had
been
engaged
in
withdrawing
or
diverting
large
amounts
of
water
from
lake
michigan
down
through
the
complex
of
the
chicago
ship
canal
and
des
planes
river
into
the
illinois
river.
and
it
was
a
question
of
what
authority
legally
there
could
be
for
such
a
diversion.
on
the
first
opinion
the
court
recognized
that
the
diversion
was
basically
made
because
chicago
did
not
have
a
proper
sewage
system.
and
instead
of
providing
such
as
system
it
just
proceeded
to
dump
all
its
sewage
right
down
this
chicago
ship
canal
and
leave
it
as
a
problem.
and
it
got
so
bad
that
something
had
to
be
used
to
flash
it
out.
and
so
they
wanted
to
use
the
water
from
the
lake
in
very
large
quantities
as
much
as
8500
cubic
feet
per
second
to
flash
out
this
canal
that
was
serving
as
a
sewage
disposal
for
the
city
of
chicago.
the
court
appointed
the
master
and
the
master
reported
that
chicago
must
have
some
kind
of
adequate
sewage
disposal
system
but
there
is
no
properly
legal
grounds
for
using
this
water
in
that
manner.
and
that
the
only
real
basis
would
be
for
the
purposes
of
navigation.
then
the
matter
was
considered
later
and
the
final
decree
was
entered.
and
you
recall
that
first
provided
for
a
use
of
6500
cubic
feet
per
second.
and
in
1935
that
was
to
be
reduced
to
5000
cubic
feet
per
second
and
then
it
was
later
to
be
reduced
to
1500
cubic
feet
per
second.
and
that
is
what
is
being
--
is
allowed
now
under
the
decree
and
there
were
these
certain
reports.
now,
the
court
didn't
find
that
there
was
any
legal
grounds
under
water
law
for
the
use
of
that
amount
of
water
for
this
sanitary
condition.
and
they
didn't
find
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
all
of
that
water
for
purposes
of
navigation.
but
the
court
did
find
that
under
equitable
principles
the
conditions
were
so
bad
in
this
situation,
had
grown
so
bad,
that
something
had
to
be
done
about
it
and
that
court
under
equity
did
not
have
to
injure
or
destroy
this
community
but
could
provide
for
the
correction
of
the
situation
as
rapidly
as
it
could
be
achieved
under
any
reasonable
prospects.
so
that
was
the
scheme
that
was
provided.
and
it
was
--
as
we
see
it,
not
contemplated,
that
the
city
of
chicago
would
have
the
right
to
use
as
domestic
pumpage
of
more
than
what
was
described
in
the
decree
as
the
water
that
it
would
pump
through
its
mains,
and
within
--
probably
for
the
communities
that
chicago
then
had
and
its
reasonable
developments
as
a
part
of
chicago.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can't
say
from
that
decree
whether
the
court
ever
contemplated
that
that
kind
of
sales
would
be
made.
the
court
carefully
described
in
paragraph
3
of
the
decree
that
it
would
be
such
water
as
was
pumped
through
the
mains
of
the
city
of
chicago.
and
i
think
in
order
to
interpret
that
properly
you
have
to
back
to
the
situation
at
that
time
and
see
what
was
being
done
in
the
chicago
area
in
handling
the
water.
and
i
think
that
could
be
established
in
--
by
proper
proof.
but
i
don't
see
any
sign
that
anybody
contemplated
at
that
time
that
the
water
would
be
used
outside
of
the
watershed
of
the
lake
michigan
as
far
as
the
use
was
concern.
now,
it
was
that
--
it
was
contemplated
to
be
diverted
by
--
after
it
passed
through
the
sanitary
system
and
then
go
down
the
illinois
river.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
assume
that
they're
not
although
i
don't
know.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
then
get
down
to
the
problem
after
examining
those
decisions
of
the
court
in
2,
3
and
4
of
what
was
contemplated
by
the
court.
the
court
provided
the
1500
cubic
feet
per
second
for
this
function
of
taking
care
of
navigation
and
flashing
out
whatever
is
necessary.
and
then
in
--
on
the
top
of
that,
it
provided
the
domestic
pumpage
that
chicago
would
require.
well
that
is
a
figure
of
about
1700
and
that
would
be
added
on
to
the
1500
cubic
feet
per
second
that's
specifically
provided
for.
the
difficulty
that
the
united
states
has
had
in
2,
3
and
4
particularly
and
we
think
it
has
a
bearing
directly
upon
15
here
is
that
we
now
have
in
the
record,
the
information
that
was
given
us
and
we
have
tendered
to
the
court
in
our
brief
in
2,
3
and
4.
the
statement
of
the
corps
of
engineers
that
all
that
is
required
for
navigational
purposes
in
the
illinois
river
in
the
canal
is
1500
cubic
feet
per
second.
so,
with
the
domestic
pumpage
being
over
1700
cubic
feet
per
second,
that
domestic
pumpage
itself
would
take
all
--
take
care
of
all
the
navigational
requirements
of
this
canal
and
the
illinois
river
without
water.
now,
the
claims
made
that
because
of
the
pollution
that's
involved,
because
chicago
was
not
able
to
produce
more
than
95%
purity
with
its
treatment
of
the
sewage
that
there
is
still
a
need
for
this
additional
water
to
produce
--
to
provide
additional
oxygen
so
that
they
can
handle
and
take
care
of
the
needs
of
this
canal
and
illinois
river
because
if
the
stream
is
--
if
that
is
too
greatly
polluted,
it
can't
be
used
properly
for
navigation.
now,
the
difficulty
we
have
with
that
is
that
in
the
decisions
of
the
court
both
the
first
and
second,
it
seems
very
clear
to
us
that
the
court
contemplated
that
there
would
be
a
complete
treatment
of
sewage
by
chicago.
that
the
court
provided
a
detailed
plan
for
the
sewage
treatment
and
that
plan
contemplated
that
they
would
use
this
facility
to
treat
all
of
the
sewage.
now,
it
was
never
--
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
it
was
never
contemplated
that
the
treatment
would
be
perfect
that
it
would
be
100%.
it
was
contemplated
that
that
treatment
would
be
satisfactory
to
extent
of
85%
to
95%
and
they
have
come
within
that
range.
in
fact
there
is
good
showing
that
was
made
to
me
that
they
might
really
obtain
the
95%
they
had
recently
because
of
some
changes
in
their
plant
and
additions
and
improvements
that
made
it
less
satisfactory
at
the
moment.
but
there's
a
good
prospect
they
might
obtain
95%.
but
there
is
also
clear
indication
that
there
is
a
substantial
portion
as
much
as
3%
annually
of
the
sewage
that
they
don't
try
to
create
at
all.
they
just
open
the
gates
and
let
it
run
down
the
river
in
the
canal.
and
consequently
they
have
a
condition
of
pollution
by
reason
of
that
that
would
not
occur
at
all
if
they
would
treat
the
sewage.
now,
it
isn't
a
simple
problem
and
that's
why
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
these
cases
and
the
handling
of
this
whole
matter
in
this
proper
disposition
to
have
a
special
master.
because
they
say
if
we
treat
all
the
sewage
and
just
--
don't
just
open
up
the
gates
when
the
flood
times
and
let
run
down
the
canal,
so
we
have
all
these
raw
sewage
and
pollution
there,
then
we've
got
to
have
sewage
plants
that
will
be
so
large
to
take
care
of
the
flood
waters
that
is
entirely
impractical.
on
the
other
side,
there
is
the
contention
that
that
isn't
necessary
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
reservoirs
and
receptacles
that
can
be
developed
under
proper
methods
of
engineering
known
to
sanitary
engineers
at
this
time
whereby
you
hold
this
material,
the
sewage
in
these
reservoirs
and
properly
taken
care
of
until
you
can
process
and
through
your
sewage
plants.
and
then
you
don't
throw
all
these
raw
sewage
in
and
just
ask
these
other
bordering
lake
states
to
furnish
the
water
to
take
care
of
it.
now,
the
basic
problem
it
seems
to
me
deals
in
the
area
of
equity
and
fairness
between
these
states
board
--
bordering
found
the
great
lakes.
and
that
is
if
the
city
--
first,
we
have
to
start
that
the
legitimate
needs
of
the
city
of
chicago,
one
of
the
great
cities
of
this
country
must
be
taken
care
of.
and
i
think
there
is
no
difficulty
between
the
states
in
agreeing
to
that
proposition.
but
secondly
that
what
ours
of
legitimate
means?
can
it
call
upon
the
other
states
to
accept
or
take
upon
themselves
burdens
that
within
reasonable
limits
are
not
necessary.
and
i
think
that's
the
second
part
that
has
to
be
worked
out
and
it
would
be
best
worked
out
by
a
special
master
in
examination
of
the
whole
problem.
because
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
there
is
--
and
a
withdrawal
of
waters
that
reduces
the
amount
of
navigation
that
can
be
conducted
in
the
great
lakes
and
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
which
would
not
be
necessary
if
they
would
properly
treat
this
sewage
or
if
they
would
avoid,
if
they
would
furnish
the
facilities
to
see
that
this
raw
sewage
was
not
thrown
into
this
canal.
and
therefore,
they
would
not
all
the
water
they
say
they
now
in
need
to
go
in
to
canal
because
of
the
impurities
they
put
in
it
themselves
unnecessarily.
the
burden
is
placed
upon
these
other
states.
if
chicago
and
illinois
take
from
--
divert
from
lake
michigan
water
that
is
not
really
needed
because
to
the
extent
of
at
least
it's
conceded
at
least
five-eighths
of
an
inch
for
each
thousand
cubic
second
feet
of
water
that
is
diverted
unnecessarily.
there
is
a
direct
bearing
upon
the
amount
of
navigation
traffic
that
can
be
handled
in
the
great
lakes
and
therefore
each
of
the
states
as
well
as
the
united
states
generally
loses
by
that
effect
upon
navigation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
no.
i
didn't
mean
in
that
sense.
i
meant
that
in
the
interest
of
trying
to
weigh
the
equities
of
what's
fair
in
this
situation
it
is
unfair
or
inequitable
to
have
illinois
ask
to
have
more
water
than
it
needs
to
solve
its
situation.
and
that
is
the
position
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
mr.
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
mr.
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
not
at
all
say
that
that
was
the
principle
involved.
i
think
the
need
is
a
factor
that
this
court
will
have
to
consider.
but
they
have
no
legal
right
that's
why
the
equitable
apportionment
comes
in
to
the
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
not
at
all.
this
court
would
have
to
weigh
that
need
and
what
it
would
involved
as
far
as
the
rest
of
the
lakes
and
the
united
states
and
canada
as
well
in
accordance
with
our
treaty
obligations
were
involved
and
decide
whether
that
need
weighed
against
that
and
i
think
the
court
would
conclude
in
the
case
the
due
but
of
course
that
if
need
couldn't
justify
that
injury
to
the
rest
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
united
states
does
not
think
it
can
be
treated
in
isolation.
we
think
that
the
whole
problem
--
the
value
of
this
great
resource
is
too
great
for
the
entire
united
states
as
well
as
all
of
these
lake
states
and
these
great
cities
to
treat
it
in
isolation.
and
that
the
whole
matter
should
be
carefully
examined
with
the
idea
of
providing
legitimate
needs
where
they
can
be
but
seeing
that
the
country's
interests
are
fully
protected
in
doing
so.
and
we
think
that
by
treating
the
cases
together
and
having
a
special
master
that
will
examine
this
whole
situation
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
having
a
special
master
that
will
examine
the
whole
situation
and
bring
in
to
the
court
an
up-to-date
presentation
of
a
factual
situation
and
the
various
equities
and
considerations
that
should
be
properly
taken
into
account
that
this
matter
could
then
be
determined
by
the
court
in
such
a
way
as
to
protect
all
of
the
interest
involved
and
resolve
this
sore
that
is
being
--
is
making
trouble
for
these
great
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
court
and
the
country
try
to
resolve
it
too
quickly
because
i'm
fearful
that
the
whole
history
of
this
litigation
has
shown
a
tendency,
well,
we're
in
such
a
bad
situation
because
of
what's
developed
that
we've
got
to
do
something
and
everybody
is
prejudiced
by
the
situation
that
has
occurred
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
best
way
to
resolve
a
matter
of
this
seriousness
to
our
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
canada
has
made
a
protest
at
some
length.
we
didn't
think
it
was
proper
to
develop
it
here
because
we
didn't
think
that
was
the
merits.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
we
would
develop
that
for
the
court
in
any
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
has
claimed
that
because
of
two
things,
the
boundary
of
waters
treaty
and
the
niagara
agreement,
there
is
no
right
to
divert
any
additional
water
from
the
great
lakes
system
without
the
common
action
under
those
agreements.
there
are
questions
as
to
whether
they
are
entitled
to
what
was
brought
a
claim
that
they've
made
and
we'd
have
to
present
those
properly
to
the
court
and
the
position
of
our
country
in
regard
to
it.
but
it
is
taking
the
position
now
and
it
was
not
done
in
regard
to
this
litigation,
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
but
in
regard
to
the
legislation,
that
inquiry
was
made
about
yesterday,
that
any
diversion
was
not
permitted
in
light
of
those
treaties.
now,
we
would
--
we
think
that
on
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
we
should
develop
that
whole
problem
fully
to
the
court
and
what
the
legal
rights
are
regarding.
but
certainly,
we
have
to
measure
whatever
we
have
agreed
to
with
canada,
what
their
rights
properly
are
under
those
agreements
against
whatever
we
want
to
do
as
a
nation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
states
would
have
any
objections
if
that
was
done.
the
united
states
thinks
there's
a
--
the
problem
isn't
quite
that
simple.
we
would
still
feel
that
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
the
equities
justified
the
court
in
allowing
that
to
be
done
taking
it
outside
of
the
watershed
even
though
it
was
moved
back
because
under
ordinary
principles,
that
is
isn't
allowed
even
to
--
even
though
they
do
return
it
to
take
it
outside
of
the
watershed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you
had
enough
of
it,
of
course
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
proof
is
pretty
clear
in
the
inquiry
that
i
had
that
milwaukee
--
everybody
is
pretty
busy
putting
effluent
back.
now
how
much
the
pollution
is,
i
would
like
to
see
properly
developed
before
a
master.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
goes
back
1900
your
honor
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
as
the
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
as
the
briefs
of
the
states
indicate
here,
they
have
a
compact
involving
the
states
of
the
great
lakes
basin
and
they
are
able
to
resolve
many
questions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
different
but
when
they
get
involved
in
the
controversy
that
properly
involves
the
boundary
commission,
it's
been
the
practice
to
submit
that
and
there
are
certain
areas
that
the
boundary
commission
does
not
have
any
jurisdiction
or
try
to
act
in.
but
i
think
they
have
--
been
able
to
handle
things
generally
in
that
area.
but
here,
they
need
badly
to
have
some
facts
developed
and
also
some
law
developed
as
to
what
their
rights
are
because
they
are
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
thought
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
thought
maybe
i
had
the
illusion
that
maybe
i
could
help
with
that
function
and
did
try
to
do
some
work
on
it
and
had
several
days
that
i'd
put
in
and
the
states
were
very
helpful
in
answering
questions
and
cooperative,
each
one
furnishing
information.
but
when
i
got
down
to
some
further
information
that
seem
necessary,
it
seemed
and
i
suggest
to
that
--
maybe
the
states
could
work
this
out
by
them
--
between
themselves.
it
seemed
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
it
done
on
that
basis
and
there's
a
feeling
i
think
on
the
part
of
the
illinois
that
they're
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right
to
do
this
and
that
they
don't
have
to
furnish
such
information
or
that
a
state
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
on
that
part.
and
i
would
question
whether
they
would
care
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
at
that
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
growth
population.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
want
--
i
would
like
before
i
leave
to
make
it
very
clear
that
the
united
states
agrees
with
the
remarks
of
mr.
justice
black
about
the
fact
that
nobody
could
dry
up
these
lakes
or
even
injure
them
without
us
being
there
to
fight
about
it
and
insist
that
the
lakes
are
a
great
resource
not
only
of
these
area
but
of
the
united
states.
