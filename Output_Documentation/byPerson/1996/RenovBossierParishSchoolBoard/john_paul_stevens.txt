justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
i
understand
your
theory,
and
your
argument's
been
very
helpful
to
me,
i
might
say.
but
say
there
is
in
the
record
evidence
that
they
drew
boundary
lines
to
segregate
blacks
when
they
were
working
out
school
districts
and
just
the
opposite
kind
of
lines
when
they
were
doing
voting
districts.
under
your
argument,
that
would
be
relevant
and
should
have
been
considered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
because
that
goes
to
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
happened,
and
there's
nothing...
no
mention
of
it
in
the
opinion,
doesn't
that
lend
some
support
to
the
view
that
the
court
took
a
different
line
of
reasoning
than
you're
advocating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
interrupt
you
with
one
other
point
there.
i
don't
think
our
question
is
whether
the
court
should
have
accepted
the
other
proposed
map.
i
agree
with
you,
that
isn't
it.
the
question
is
whether
it
was
correct
to
adopt
the
plan
it
did
adopt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
