and
that
it
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
evidence...
and
this
was
what
justice
scalia
asked
at
the
very
first,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
wasn't
sure
that
you
completed
your
answer,
and
it's
relevant
to
what
you're
discussing
now
with
justice
breyer.
what
is
the
evidence,
other
than
bloc
voting,
that
should
have
been
considered
and
that
was
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
are
all
subsidiary
elements
of
the
bloc
voting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
again,
most
of
these
things
are
in
the
record.
it's
just
not
clear
that
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--district
court
weighed
them
in
a
section
2
context.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
position
is
that
all
these
matters
and
many
others
like
them
must
become
a
part
of
a
section
5
case
and
must
be
resolved
under
section
2
standards
before
there
can
be...
the
preclearance
decision
can
be
made?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
thought
there
were
two
points.
one
is
that
it
may
be
relevant
to
purpose.
the
other
is
that
there
must
be
a
specific
ruling
on
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
section
2
violation.
don't
you
have...
don't
you
make
both
arguments
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
they
do
that
within
the
window
that
the
legislature
gave
them?
