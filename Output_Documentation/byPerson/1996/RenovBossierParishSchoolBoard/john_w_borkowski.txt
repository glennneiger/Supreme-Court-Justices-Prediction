mr.
john
w.
borkowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
question
justice
scalia
just
asked
about
footnote
18,
because
that
shows
very
clearly,
i
think,
what
has
been
going
on
in
bossier
parish.
the
evidence
that
the
court
didn't
look
at
that
dealt
with
the
board's
exclusion,
admitted
exclusion
of
blacks
from
educational
policy
issues.
the
court
had
ordered
that
a
committee
be
established
to
allow
blacks
to
have
an
opportunity
for
input
into
school
board
issues.
this
is
the
kind
of
nonresponsiveness,
the
kind
of
exclusion
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
redistricting
process.
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
that's
absolutely
right,
and
the
facts
on
this
record
are
that
the
board
admitted
in
the
direct
testimonies
of
mr.
musgrove
and
mr.
myrick,
the
two
board
members
who
testified,
that
when
this
committee
started
getting
into
educational
policy
issues,
they
disbanded,
because
they
did
not
want
this
committee
having
a
role
in
it.
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
yes,
it
was.
the
consent
decree
established
it
for
that
purpose,
and
the
representations
to
the
contrary,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
in
the
appellee's
brief,
are
simply
false,
and
the
record
bears
that
out.
the--
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
--these
facts
only
become
relevant
in
a
purpose
determination.
had
the
board
come
forward
and
not...
and
been
able
to
show
legitimate
reasons,
and
there
were
not
these...
not
this
pattern
there,
this
evidence
wouldn't
come
in.
this
is
an
unusual
case.
in
this
purpose
determination
these
factors
have
to
be
considered.
justice
o'connor--
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
--i'm
focusing
here
on
the
purpose
argument
only,
and
justice
o'connor
asked
whether
the
arlington
heights
standard
was
the
standard
for
section
5,
and
in
pleasant
grove
even
the
dissenters,
who
did
not
find
discriminatory
purpose,
cited
arlington
heights
as
the
proper
standard
to
apply,
and
decisions
that
this
court
has
affirmed...
busbee
v.
smith
and
port
arthur...
also
apply
to
arlington
heights,
and
it's
the
constitutional
standard,
and...
so
i'm
just
talking
at
this
point
about
the
purpose
argument.
all
of
these
factors
under
arlington
heights
are
relevant
to
showing
discriminatory
purpose,
and
the
court
erred
in
excluding
it.
as
justice
scalia
asked,
how
do
we
know
that
the
court
did
this?
well,
the
court
said
we
will
not
permit
section
2
evidence
to
prove
discriminatory
dis--
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
--twenty-four
a,
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
on
23a
the
court
said
we
must...
it's
argued
that
we
must
consider--
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
--on
23a
and
24a,
the
court
at
three
different
times
says
that
it's
not
going
to
consider
this
evidence.
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
twenty-three
a,
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
paragraph,
we...
it's
argued
that
we
must
still
consider
evidence
of
a
section
2
violation
as
evidence
of
a
discriminatory
purpose
under
section
5.
we
again
disagree.
at
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph,
and
miller
forecloses
the
permitting
of
section
2
evidence
in
a
section
5
case,
and
then,
at
the
end
of
that
section,
in
24a,
we
will
not
permit
section
2
evidence
to
prove
discriminatory
purpose
under
section
5.
judge
kessler,
in
dissent,
in
footnote
4--
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
--yes.
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
well,
there
are
three
different
statements,
and
one
of
the
statements
that...
the
statement
you
referred
to
could
be
interpreted
that
way,
but
judge
kessler
in
dissent
says
to
the...
says
in
footnote
4
on
page
42a
that
the
majority
is
not
considering
this
evidence,
and
the
majority
never
says
it
is.
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
the
majority
analyzes,
it
only
analyzes
two
types
of
evidence,
and
doesn't
look
at
all
sorts
of
evidence.
you
asked
what
was
excluded.
the
fact
that
the
board's
plan
fractures
black
neighborhoods,
the
same
neighborhoods
that
the
school
board
members
consciously
kept
together
in
drawing
75-percent
black
school
attendance
boundaries
were
fractured
by
the
plan.
that's
a...
those
are
stipulated,
unrebutted
facts
on
this
record
that
appear
nowhere
in
the
majority's
discussion
of
discriminatory
intent,
because
they
would
also
be
relevant
to
section
2.
there
are
communities
of
interest
that
our
clients
have
and
other
black
voters
in
bossier
parish
have
that
are
established
by
the
testimony.
that
is
nowhere
discussed
in
the
majority's
opinion.
the...
what
this
court
has
called
the
inexorable
zero,
the
fact
that
no
blacks
have
ever
been
elected
to
the
school
board,
is
nowhere
discussed
in
the
analysis
of
the
board's
purpose,
and
we
think
these...
this
kind
of
evidence
cannot
logically
be
excluded
just
because
it's
also
relevant
to
a
section
2--
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
--yes.
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke
there.
all
of
this
evidence
is
stipulated
facts,
is
testimony
admitted
into
the
record
before
this
court.
it's
just
not
considered
in
the
majority
opinion.
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
no.
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
violation
per
se
simply
not
to
mention
evidence
that
is
considered.
the
point
here
is
that
if
the
court
actually
did
consider
this
evidence,
which
in
every
category
of
evidence
in
arlington
heights
shows
discriminatory
purpose,
it
could
not
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
reached.
as
judge
kessler
said
in
dissent,
this
is...
the
evidence
is
far
from
being
equally
convincing
on
either
side.
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
stipulated
and
unrebutted
evidence,
this
is
not
a
close
case.
the
problem
here
with
the
majority's
approach,
and
the
problem
in...
if
this
court
would
affirm
the
majority's
decision,
is
that
it
would
effectively
eviscerate
the
purpose
prong
of
section
5.
it
would
mean
that
the
only
kind
of
discriminatory
purpose
that
would
be
reachable
under
section
5
would
be
publicly
admitted
or
covertly
tape
recorded
discriminatory
purpose,
because
every
other
category
of
evidence
that
this
court
has
said
in
arlington
heights
requires
a
sensitive
inquiry
is
here.
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
i
believe
that
on
this
record
the
court
should
not...
should
simply
remand
with
instructions
that
preclearance
be
denied,
because
the
record
here
overwhelmingly
establishes
discriminatory
purpose.
there's
no
way,
unless--
mr.
john
w.
borkowski
--then
i
would
say
that
you
would
have
to
remand
with
instructions
to
apply
arlington
heights
and
to
look
at
all
of
the
evidence
that
this
court
in
the
voting
context,
in
section
5
cases,
in
school
cases,
in
all
cases
where
intent
is
an
issue,
to
look
at
that
evidence
in
all
of
those
categories,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
school
board
here.
there
was
also
evidence
that
the
court
considered
that
the
court
offered
its
own
explanations
for,
which
we
cite
in
our
briefs
as
another
legal
error.
the
only
evidence,
contemporaneous,
direct
evidence
of
the
board's
intent
are
admissions
that
tend
to
show
discriminatory
purpose.
there
are
no
contemporaneous
minutes
offering
nonracial
reasons
for
why
the
board
did
what
it
did.
there's
no
legislative
history
indicating
nonracial
reasons.
there
are
statements
that
some
board
members
are
hostile
to
black--
