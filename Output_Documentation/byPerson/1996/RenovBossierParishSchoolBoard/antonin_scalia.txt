--how
do
we
know
that
they
didn't
take
that
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
particular
evidence.
what
particular
evidence
do
you
maintain
they
did
not
take
account
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
how
do
you
know
that
they
didn't
take
account
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
didn't
the...
i
mean,
the
response
that's
made
by
the
appellee
here
is
that
the
court...
that
all
that
that
would
prove
is
that
therefore,
since
there
was
bloc
voting,
it
would
advantage
the
black
voters
if
there
were
majority
black
districting,
but
didn't
the
court
assume
that
to
be
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
assume
that...
i
thought
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
i
thought
that
the
court's
discussion
just
takes
as
a
given
that
it
would
be
to
the
benefit
of
the
blacks
if
they
had
a
majority-minority
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
patrick,
here's
what
footnote
18
says.
it
seems
to
me
entirely
reasonable.
defendant
mentions
the
continuing
duty
of
the--
--where
are
you
reading?
it's
on
page
34a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
defendant
mentions
the
continuing
duty
of
the
school
board
to
"remedy
any
remaining
vestiges
of
the
dual
school
system
under
the
order
in
lemon
v.
bossier
parish
school
board,
citing
in
particular
the
school
board's
failure
to
maintain
a
biracial
committee.
"
"we
fail
to
see
how
this
can
be
in
any
way
related
to
the
school
board's
purpose
in
adopting
the
police
jury
plan.
"
i
don't...
that
seems
to
me
quite
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
considered
it,
but
in
its
judgment
did
not
find
it
to
be
related.
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--must
the
court
find
that
it
proves
what
you
want
it
to
prove
in
order
to
comply
with
the
law?
it
seems
to
me
the
court
need
only
consider
it,
and
then
it's
a
matter
of
judgment
whether
it
shows
the
animus
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
it,
can
be
in
any
way
related,
means
whether
it
has
anything
to
do
with
as
a
factual
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
i
took
that...
evidence
of
a
violation,
i
took
that
to
mean
evidence
that
a
violation
existed,
rather
than
evidence
which
could
be
used
to
show
a
violation
for
the
one
could
be
used
to
show
a
violation
for
the
other.
i
took
that
to
mean,
we
reject
the
notion
that
you
can
come
in
and
say,
the
district
is
in
violation
of
section
2,
and
you
quarrel
with
that
statement,
too.
you
would
allow
a
section
2
violation
to
be
brought
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
we're
discussing
here
is
whether
evidence
that
would
go
to
show
a
violation
may
be
brought
in,
and
i
don't
see
this
as
contradicting
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
did...
isn't
mentioned
in
the
majority
opinion.
suppose
the
court
considered
it
but
didn't
mention
it
in
its
opinion.
is
it...
is
the
judgment
invalid
because
it
was
not
mentioned
in
the
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there
are
two
different
points.
number
1
is
that
the
court
didn't
even
consider
it,
and
if
i
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
the
language
we
were
just
discussing,
then
you
would
have
established
that
the
court
didn't
even
consider
it,
but
arguably
the
court
could
have
considered
it
but
not
have
thought
it
germane
enough
or
significant
enough
to
be
mentioned
in
its
opinion.
would
that
also
be
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
other
evidence
not
only
shows
impact,
it
also
shows
what
you
might
call
disposition.
doesn't
the
evidence
of
a
violation
on
racial
grounds
of
section
2
show
that
you're
talking
about
people
here
who
are
likely
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
isn't
that
relevant
to
the
section
5
determination?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
disposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
character
of
the
people
who
made
the
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that
in
the
joint
appendix?
you
gave
a
page
number.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
write
it
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
factors
of
arlington
heights
are
not
so
arcane.
if
you
asked
somebody
on
the
street,
what
would
you
look
at,
he'd
probably
come
up
with
the
same
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
argument's
a
little
further
than
that,
as
i
understood
the
last
argument.
that
is,
even
the
police
jury
itself
could
not
do
it
once
the
window
of
opportunity
had
closed.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
had...
but
again,
the
argument
made
was
that
they
had
an
obligation
to
come
up
with
districts
before
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
wrong?
did
they
have
no
obligation
to
come
up
with--
