chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-1455,
janet
reno
v.
bossier
parish
school
board,
and
george
price
v.
bossier
parish
school
board.
how
do
you
pronounce
the
name
of
this
parish,
do
you
know,
mr.
patrick?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bossier,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
think
in
french
it
would
be
bossier
rather
than
bossier.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
patrick--
[laughter]
--you
may
proceed,
whatever
the
name
of
the
parish.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
patrick,
when
you
say
the
district
court
ignored
the
evidence,
you
don't
mean
that
it
excluded
it
as
a
matter
of
admission
of
evidence,
but
just
that
it
refused
to
take
it
into
consideration
in
making
its
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
came
in
by
stipulation,
or
it's
not
an
evidentiary
point,
really,
it's
an
argument
that
the
court's
refusal
to
take
it
into
consideration
makes
its
findings
clearly
erroneous
or
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law,
i--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
evidence
wasn't
so
much
excluded
as
not
considered--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
the
technical
sense
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
evidentiary
rule,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
patrick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
borkowski,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we're...
if
you're
going
to
get
into
the
sort
of
detail
that
you
say
arlington
heights
requires
us
to
get
into,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
important
to
know
whether
the
school
board's
failure
to
maintain
a
biracial
committee
was
the
result
of
hostility
to
the
idea,
neglect,
maybe
unable
to
have
the
funds,
maybe
just
got
lost
in
the
shuffle.
in
other
words,
just
saying
it
failed
to
maintain
a
biracial
committee,
if
we're
going
to
get
into
the
sort
of
textual
detail
that
arlington
heights
says,
you
have
to
know
more
about
it
than
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
the
committee
set
up
to
deal
with
educational
policy
issues?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
borkowski?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
23a,
so
we
can
follow
you
when
you
read.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
point
out
at
least
one
of
them,
will
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
excluded,
you
mean
the
court
may
not
fail
to
consider
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
borkowski.
mr.
carvin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
appellants'
argument
is
that
the
findings
were
clearly
erroneous
because
there
was
so
much
other
evidence
pointing
in
the
other
direction,
that
isn't
requiring
the
district
court
to
put
its
opinion
in
some
sort
of
procrustean
bed.
that's
an
ordinary
clearly
erroneous
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
carvin.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
patrick,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
patrick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
