mr.
patrick,
would
you
clarify
for
me
what
you
think
the
legal
standard
is
before
we
go
much
further
into
the
argument?
that
is,
we
know
that
the
effect,
what
they
call
the
effect
problem
of
section
5
is
about
retrogression.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
the
purpose...
what
does
it
mean?
what
does
the
statute
mean
when
it
says,
shall
not
have
the
purpose
of
denying
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
we
didn't
have
the
process
and
the
sequence,
if
we
just
had
a
lazy
school
board
that
said,
oh,
the
police
jury
got
this
plan,
and
it
was
precleared,
so
we'll
take
it
with
all
its
faults,
if
it
hadn't
been
that,
would
this...
would
it
have
been
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
would
you
say
is
the
instruction,
on
your
view
of
this
case,
that
the
district
court
should
be
given
were
we
to
remand?
we'd
say,
district
court,
you
did
wrong,
and
this
is
what
you
should
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
that
and
we
think
that
the
first
shot,
anyway,
should
be...
or
the
second...
done
by
the
district
court,
what
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
carvin,
this...
clarify
one
thing
about
what
you
call
the
naac
plan
that
was
rejected.
i
didn't
think
that
plan
was
put
forward
as
a
rival
to
some
other
plan.
this
case
is
not
like
the
one
we
just
heard
in
that
regard.
i
thought
that
plan
was
just
put
forward
to
show
that
it
would
be
possible
to
create
minority
districts,
not
that
this
was
a
finished
plan
that
was
a
rival
to
some
other
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
splitting
a
precinct
is
something
that
even
the
jury...
the...
whatever
it's
called,
the
police
jury
did.
not
terribly
many,
but
they
did
for
their
plan,
didn't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
get
permission
to
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
how
was
it
done?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
carvin,
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
that
you
do
accept
that
arlington
heights
is
a
relevant
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right,
so
you
think
that
it
was
just
so
understood
that
the
district
court
didn't
need
to
mention
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
was
it
rational
to
set
up
school
districts
with
some
districts
that
had
a
few
schools,
several
schools,
and
some
districts
that
had
no
schools
at
all?
it
just
seems
a
very
odd
kind
of
a
school
districting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
were
resisting
the
jury
police--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--plan
originally.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
are
you
saying
that
it
was...
incumbency
was
the
only
thing
that
kept
them
from
resisting
the--
