it...
we...
it
is
usually
referred
to
and
has
been
in
the
litigation
as
bossier
parish,
but
in
louisiana
it's
bossier.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
and
if
you
say
bossier...
if
you
say
bossier
in
the
course
of
this
i'll
probably
be
confused,
so
if
you
say
bossier
it
would
be
helpful.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
bossier,
oui.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
oui.
allons.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
bossier
parish
school
board
adopted
the
redistricting
plan
at
issue
in
this
case
with
a
discriminatory
purpose,
plain
and
simple,
and
in
finding
otherwise,
the
district
court
ignored
evidence
that
this
court
has
required
fact-finders
to
consider
since
its
decision
in
the
arlington
heights
case,
evidence
of
racial
block
voting
and
of
the
recent
history
of
discrimination
in
voting
and
otherwise
in
bossier
parish,
evidence
that
was
undisputed,
indeed
was
stipulated
below.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
frankly,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
very
hard
to
say.
there
was
not
an
evidentiary
ruling
in
the
classic
sense,
in...
because
all
of
the
evidence
came
into
the
record
by
way
of
stipulation
without
objection
by
the
parties,
but
what
is
plain
is
that
the
court
did
not
even
mention
the
arlington
heights
case
or
the
arlington
heights
standards,
and
in
one
point
in
the
decision
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
would
not
expressly
consider
the
evidence
of
the
history
of
discrimination
in
the
school
board,
and
when
you...
excuse
me,
mr.--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--well,
as
a
matter
of
law
in
the
first
instance,
your
honor,
because
under
arlington
heights,
which
requires
that
in
making
a
determination
of
purposeful
discrimination
that
the
court
take
into
account
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
where
rogers
v.
lodge
has
said
that
this
specific
kind
of
evidence
is
important
to
a
determination
of
purposeful
discrimination,
we
argue
in
the
first
instance
that
there
was
a
violation
of...
that
there
is
a
legal
error
and,
indeed,
when
you
take--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--because
they
did
not,
in
the
first
instance,
even
cite
the
arlington
heights
precedent.
they
did
not
indicate
what
standard
was
being
used
in
the...
if
you
look
at
the
analysis--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--it's--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--there
are
two
kinds
of
evidence
that
bends
to
the
question,
your
honor,
about
how
we
know
they
didn't
take
account
of
it.
first
of
all,
the
evidence
of
racial
bloc
voting.
this
is
a
community
where
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
80
percent
of
the
voters
in
the
parish
will
not
vote
for
a
candidate
of
a
race
different
than
them.
that
is
stipulated
at
122a
of
the
record.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--i...
excuse
me.
did
you...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
i'm
not
sure
that
we
can
fairly
assume
that
from
the
district
court's
opinion.
what
the
district
court
said
is
that
evidence
of
this
kind
is
relevant
to
section
2,
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
we
contend,
and
arlington
heights
supports
us,
that
it
is
independently
relevant
to
the
question
of
purposeful
discrimination.
there
is
no
evidence,
in
fact,
on
this
record
which
is
relevant
to
the
one
question,
the
section
2
question,
but
not
relevant
to
the
purpose
determination
in
the
case
and,
indeed,
the
court
expressly
refused
in
its
opinion
at
34a,
footnote
18,
the
evidence
that
the
board
itself
was
in
violation
of
the
federal
desegregation
order
with
respect
to
the
schools,
so
that
when
you
take
into
account
the
evidence
that
was
excluded
and
the...
both
the
racial
bloc
voting
and
the
history
of
discrimination,
all
of
which
is
stipulated
and
uncontested
below,
and
you
think...
and
you
consider
that
in
light
of
the
other
evidence
that
was
considered,
that
the
plan--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--i
think
that's--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--i
think
that's
fair
to
say.
when
i
think
of
excluded
as
a
trial
lawyer
i
think
of
a--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--of
a
rule
of
evidence...
that's
right,
and
because
all
of
the
stipulations
came
into
the
record
without
objection
on
relevance
or
any
other
grounds,
i
think
your
honor
is
right.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
what
this
court
has
done--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--i
rely
on
rogers
v.
lodge,
which
is
a...
which,
as
you
know,
is
a
case
where
the
court
has
said
that
the
arlington
heights
factors
are
probative
of
the
judgment
about
whether
there's
purposeful
discrimination
under
the
voting
rights
act.
i
think
what
is
key
in
your
analysis
and
consideration
of
this
case
is
that
you
bear
in
mind
all
of
the
facts,
as
arlington
heights
requires,
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
known
to
the
board
at
the
time,
and
ask
yourself,
does
it
add
up?
this
is
a
plan,
you
understand,
that
is
against
the
school
board's
own
interests,
both
its
districting
and
its
governance
interests.
this
is
a
school
board
that
is
typically
concerned
about
distributing
the
schools
among
the
school
districts,
and
yet
adopted
a
plan
that
has
some
school
districts
with
no
schools
in
it
at
all.
that
is
stipulated
at
112a
and
73a
of
the
record.
it--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--yes.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
we
take
that
to
mean
that
the
factors...
that
the
school
board
has
to
show
a
nondiscriminatory
purpose
within
the
meaning
of
arlington
heights
by
taking
into
account
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
looking
at
the
actions
and
inactions
in
this
case
of
the
school
board,
in
reaching
the
conclusion
they
did,
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
known
to
the
board
at
the
time.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
that's
right.
i
was
saying
that
the...
about
the
plan
that
they
did
adopt
that
this
is
a
plan
which
it
is
conceded
does
not
respect
school
attendance
zones.
that's
also
stipulated
in
this
record,
at
112a.
it
pits
incumbents
against
each
other.
the
way
the
district
court
put
it
was
that
it
wreaks
havoc
on
incumbent...
incumbency.
that's
28a
in
the
court's
opinion.
about
half
of
the
parish
was
placed
in
one
district.
that's
also
at
120a,
and
in
other
places
it
fractures
neighborhoods,
110a
to
111a.
these
are
all
stipulated
facts.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
it
was
clearly
erroneous.
it's
not
entirely
clear
that
that
was
the
court's--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--the
court's
reasoning.
what
the
court
said
was
that
it
might
be
a
legitimate
reason
to
seek
easy
preclearance.
what
your
honor's
question
implies
is
that
the
reason
was
that
they
wanted
to
avoid
a
controversy
with
the
black
citizens,
but--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--if
that's
what
it
was.
i
do
think
your
honor
is
right
that
the
process
and
the
sequence
of
events
leading
up
to
the
decision
is
extremely
telling
and,
indeed,
arlington
heights
requires
that
that
be
considered
as
well.
this
was
a
process
that
was
undertaken
more
than
3
years
before
they
needed
the
plan.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
different
case.
clearly,
the...
that's
not
the
case
we
have
here,
because
we
have
a
board
that
expected
to
draw
a
plan
different
from
the
police
jury
plan
at
the
outset.
that
is
stipulated,
too,
as
well
in
the
record
and,
indeed,
we
have
a
board
that
had
a
different
plan
from
the
police
jury
for
a
decade
or
more
before
they
were
faced
with
the
redistricting
considerations.
this
is
a
board
that
hired
a
cartographer
with
the
expectation
he
would
spend
200...
250
hours
drawing
a
plan
different
from
the
police
jury
and
went
about
that
at
a
leisurely
pace
for
over
a
year.
everything
changed
when
the
black
citizens
came
forward
and
asked
that
they
be
fairly
represented
in
the
districting--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--process.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
well,
we're
certainly
not
contending
that
you
can
build
a
section
5
out
of
only...
section
5
case
out
of
only
that,
but
frankly
there
is
no
way
to
understand
the
district
court's
opinion
by
saying
that
it
won't
consider
for
section
5
purposes
evidence
that's
relevant
to
section
2
on
a
record
where
all
of
the
evidence
is
relevant
both
to
section
2
and
section
5,
as
other
than...
meaning
the
purpose
prong
of
section
5
as
other
than--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--yes.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
that
no
black
person
had
ever
been
elected
to
the
school
board.
that's
stipulated
at
115a.
that
there
had
never
been
more
than
one
black
member
of
the
police
jury.
that's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
55
to
60.
that
blacks
had
rarely
been
elected
anywhere
in
the
parish
at
the
time.
that's
stipulated
at
127a----
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--that's
right,
and
then
in
terms
of
the
history
of
discrimination,
at
the
time
of
the
decision
this
board
was
in
violation
of
its
duty
to
redress
school
segregation
under
brown.
that
was
noted
by
the
district
court,
to
be
sure,
in
footnote
2
of--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--well,
they're
all--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--they're--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--you're
right
that
they're
all
in
the
record,
justice
kennedy,
there's
no
question
about
that.
what
is
apparent,
however,
is
that
the
district
court
was
not
taking
them
into
account
as
is
required
by
arlington
heights
in
making
its
judgment
about
purposeful
discrimination.
and
with
respect
to
the
history
of
discrimination,
remember,
this
is
a
school
board
that
stipulated
on
the
record
that
segregation
has
increased
since
the
court...
since
they've
been
under
federal
court
order
and,
indeed,
that
they
were
assigning
teachers
to
schools
on
racial
grounds.
this
is
a...
the
district
court
said
expressly
in
footnote
18
of
its
opinion
that
it
would
not
consider
evidence
that
the
board
itself
was
in
violation
of
its
duties
under
the
federal
court
order
to
desegregate
the
schools.
that's
the
evidence
that
was
not
considered.
that
is
the
evidence
that
should
have
been
considered
under
the
arlington
heights
standard,
and
if
you
add
to
that,
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
the
sequence
issues
in
just
a
moment,
but
if
you
add
to
that
that
this
is
a
school
board
that
came
before
the
united
states
district
court,
to
say
nothing
of
the
attorney
general,
and
urged
false
reasons...
false
reasons
for
why
it
was...
why
it
made
the
decision
it
did,
i...
we
submit
that
a
jurisdiction
with
a
clean,
nondiscriminatory
motive
does
not
come
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
urge
false
reasons,
and--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--well,
your
honor,
it--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--well--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--what
weight
it's
given
is
a
matter
of
judgment,
guided
by
the
precedents
of
this
court,
but
whether
it
relates
has
been
resolved
by
this
court.
that's
what
arlington
heights
is
about.
arlington
heights
says--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--that's
right,
and
arlington
heights
says
that
it
does
have
something
to
do
with
the
determination
about
whether
there
was
or
was
not
purposeful
discrimination.
legislative
or
administrative
history
at
268
of
the
arlington
heights
opinion
was
specifically
noted
and,
indeed,
the
rogers
v.
lodge
case
states
that
the
evidence,
evidence
of
this
very
kind,
bears
heavily
on
the
issue
of
purposeful
discrimination,
is,
indeed,
important
evidence
of
purposeful
exclusion.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
thank
you.
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
thank
you,
and
if
the...
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please,
i'd
just
like
to
return
to
a
question
i
didn't
answer
very
well
from
justice
o'connor.
you
asked
about
cases
where
the
court
has,
in
the
section
5
context,
reflected
its
respect
for
the
arlington
heights
standards,
and
they...
those
cases
are
cited...
they're
beyond
rogers
v.
lodge.
they're
cited
in
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
i'm
sorry
it
wasn't
very
complete
earlier.
also,
there
was
a
statement
made
about
precinct
changes
and
precinct-splitting
that
was...
has
been
argued
by
the
parish.
in
fact,
precincts
could
be
split,
indeed,
were
split
by
the
police
jury.
they
split
20
precincts.
you'll
see
that
on...
stipulated
at
88a
and
88...
89a.
the
only
argument
is,
the
only--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--i
believe
they
did,
yes,
and
the
only
argument,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
school
board
could
not
split
precincts
without
the
police
jury's
permission.
the
school
board
never
tried
to
get
the
police
jury's
permission.
they
expected
to
do
so.
they
set
out
to
draw
a
different
plan--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--well,
but
the
window
of
opportunity
opens
again
on...
after
the
1st
of
january,
1993,
and
that's
important.
that
was
known
to
the
school
board
at
the
time--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--well,
that's
right.
they...
i
understand
that
argument,
but
what
we
do
know
is
that--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--i'm
not
convinced
it's
right,
justice
scalia,
but
what
is
clear
is
that
consolidation
after
the
window
opened
again
has
happened
in
bossier
parish.
it
was
done
by
the
police
jury
and
could
have
been
done,
and
indeed
the
record
indicates
that
the
school
board
could
have
drawn
a
plan
with
two
majority-minority
districts
in
it
that
ended
up
with
fewer
precincts
in
it
than
the
police
jury
plan.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
court
needs
to
understand
that
this
is
not
a
choice.
this
case
is
not
about
a
choice
between
the
plan
they
adopted
and
the
naacp
alternative.
that
is
a...
that's
a
ruse.
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
this
is
about
the
school
board's
unwillingness
to
consider
any
alternative
at
all
to
the
plan
that
they
knew
at
the
time
was
dilutive,
and
which
they
admit
on
the
record
at
the
time
they
knew
they
could
have
drawn
one
with
two
reasonably
compact
majority-minority
districts.
it
is
not
maximizing
for
the
department
of
justice
to
question
a
jurisdiction
that
draws
a
plan
which
hardly
serves
its
own
interests,
that
pits
incumbents
against
each
other,
that
distributes
the
schools
in
irrational
ways,
and
is
dilutive,
rather
than
adopting
a
plan
that
is
fair,
and
that
is
really
what
this
case
is
about.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
mr.
deval
l.
patrick
--thank
you.
