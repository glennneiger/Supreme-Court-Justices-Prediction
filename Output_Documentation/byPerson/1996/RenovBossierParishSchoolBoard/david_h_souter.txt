justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
patrick,
would
it
have
been
open
or
was
it
open
at
the
district
court
to
accept
all
of
this
and
say,
look,
all
of
this
evidence
does
point
in
the
direction
of
intent
to
discriminate,
but
there's
a
piece
of
counterevidence
here
and
that
is,
the
moment
at
which
the
board
seemed
to
turn
around
and
suddenly
embrace
the
police
district
plan,
which
it
did
not
originally
want,
was
the
moment
at
which
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight
about
this.
it
was
the
moment
following
the
naacp's
submission,
i
think,
of
a
couple
of
plans.
and
it
is
findable
on
this
record
that
what
the
board
wanted
to
do
was
to
avoid
7
years
of
litigation,
and
basically
the
board
said,
look,
we'll
take
peace,
even
though
we
don't
like
the
way
we're
getting
it.
we'll
take
peace
with
all
of
these
defects.
if
that
was
the
court's
reasoning
process,
would
that
have
been
clearly
erroneous,
or,
indeed,
was
that
clearly
erroneous?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
wanted
to
avoid
litigation,
and
they
could
see
it
coming.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
my
difficulty--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my...
i'm
sorry.
my
difficulty
with
that
argument
is...
goes
to
a
statement
which
the
court
made
back
on
23a,
which
we
were
referring
to
a
moment
ago,
in
the
appendix.
do
you
have
that
handy?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
will
agree
that
some
of
the
court's
statement
about
what
it
was
doing
with
evidence
perhaps
were
ambiguous
and
lent
themselves
to
your
interpretation,
but
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
the
court
quotes
from--
--twenty-three
a?
yes,
page
23a.
the
court
quotes
from
a
panel
opinion
of
a
different
panel
but
at
the
same
court,
and
this
is
what
it
says:
as
the
panel
noted,
the
court
in
miller
reaffirmed
that
the
purpose
prong
of
section
5
must
be
analyzed
within
the
context
of
section
5's
purpose,
which
has
always
been
to
ensure
that
no
voting
procedure
changes
would
be
made
that
would
lead
to
a
retrogression
in
the
position
of
racial
minorities.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
is
there
making
it
clear
that
the
only
purpose
evidence
it
would
consider
was
evidence
of
purpose
to
effect
a
retrogression,
as
opposed
to
a
broader
purpose
to
discriminate.
isn't
that
fairly
clear?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
explain
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
did
it
quote
what
i
just
read?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it
doesn't...
the
quotation
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
sense
on
your
theory
of
the
court's
view
of
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
your
position
here?
is
it
your
position
here
that
the
only
purpose
that
is
relevant
under
section
5
is
purpose
to
cause
retrogression,
as
distinct
from
purpose
to
discriminate
by
effecting
a
purposeful
dilution?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
could
have
been
a
purpose
to
dilute.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
question
goes
to--
--i'm
not
talking
about
awareness.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
suppose
the
answer
is
that
people
haven't
changed
that
much
over
the
course
of
3
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
evidence
of
bloc
voting,
which,
in
fact,
is
evidence
which
discloses
an
intent,
is
irrelevant--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
evidence
of
intent
under
section
5?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it
was
just
cumulative,
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
but
if
i
may
just--
justice
david
h.
souter
--get
clear
on
this,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
for
the
court
to
say,
we
will
consider
this
evidence
for
the
section
5
purpose
issue.
that
would
have
been
legally
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the
court
ever
say
that
the
reason
it
was
keeping
it
out
was
that
it
was
superfluous
and
cumulative?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
carvin,
i
just
don't
think
the
court's
opinion
on
page
23a
is
consistent
with
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
go
up
to
the
top
of
that
first
full
paragraph.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
court
summarizes
the
argument
that
it's
responding
to.
defendant
argues
that
even
if
we
decide
that
a
section
2
action
cannot
be
brought
in
a
section
5
preclearance
proceeding,
we
must
still
consider
evidence
of
a
section
2
violation
as
evidence
of
discriminatory
purpose
under
section
5.
again,
we
disagree.
as
we
have
said,
the
statutory
language
sets
forth
differing
standards
for
the
two
sections.
isn't
that,
when
read
in
relation
to
the
quote
that
i
started
from,
the
bloc
vote
from
the
earlier
opinion,
isn't
that
a
pretty
clear
indication
that
what
the
court
was
finding
was,
or
assuming
was,
not
that
this
evidence
was
cumulative
or
superfluous,
but
that
it
was
irrelevant?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
have
conceded
that
it
was
relevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
says
the
two
sections
have
different
purposes,
and
the
argument
was
that
you
must
consider
the
evidence
that
might
go
to
section
2
for
section
5
purpose,
and
the
court
says
we
disagree.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is
not
what
the
court
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
court
says,
these
two
sections
have
different
purposes.
let
justice
souter
finish
his
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--before
you
answer,
mr.
carvin.
it
says,
these
two
sections
have
different
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
do,
but
they
also
have
a
purpose
in
common,
don't
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
intent
to
cause
dilution
is
relevant
under
section
2
and
under
section
5.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
doesn't
the
court's
explanation
indicate
that
that's
not
what
the
court
thought?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
they
both
have
purpose
standards.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
your
own
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
an
error
there,
because
evidence
of
racial
bloc
voting
would
indeed
go
to
purpose,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't...
i
thought
you
agreed
that
that
was
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
that
the
reason
it
was
kept
out
was
cumulativeness.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
your
position?
do
you
think...
you
agree,
don't
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
evidence
of
racial
bloc
voting
would
be
relevant
evidence
under
the
purpose
prong
of
section
5,
don't
you?
