mr.
michael
a.
carvin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
focusing
on
the
standard
that
the
district
court
actually
did
apply
in
assessing
the
evidence.
appellants
would
have
this
court
believe
that
the
district
court
had
in
front
of
it
a
body
of
evidence
that
it
considered
probative
to
the
question
of
purpose,
and
it
sifted
through
that
evidence
and
threw
out
all
the
evidence
that
it
also
thought
was
relevant
to
section
2,
but
of
course
the
district
court
did
not
say
that,
and
did
not
do
that.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
what...
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes,
i
do.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
first
of
all,
the
case
he
is
citing
from
did
not...
was
making
the
point
that
in
analyzing
purpose
you
must
look
at
the
limited
purpose
of
section
5
and
not
get
into
these
additional
section
2
issues
that
the
justice
department
had
urged
upon
the
court
in
texas
and
was
also
urging
upon
the
court
here.
but
more
directly
to
answer
your
question,
of
course,
it
was
stipulated
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
retrogressive
effect
of
the
plan,
so
under
your
understanding
of
the
district
court
opinion,
the
district
court
would
have
only
been
looking
at,
at
did
they
have
a
purpose
to
effect
a
retrogression?
this
would
have
been
a
very
short
opinion
indeed
if
that
had
been
its
analysis.
it
did
not
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
new
plan
compared
to
the
status
quo
ante.
it
looked
at
the
purpose
of
the
new
plan
as
compared
to
the
maximization
alternative
proposed
by
the
naacp.
the
plan
adopted
had
no
black
majority
districts.
the
naacp
plan
had
two
black
majority
districts.
the
district
court
spent
its
entire
opinion
analyzing,
did
the
board
do
that...
it's
decision
because
of
its
negative
impact
on
minority
voters
or
in
spite
of
it?
did
it
have
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
motives
for
rejecting
the
naacp
plan,
or
was
it
motivated
by
a
racial
reason?
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
again--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
but
in
isolation
it
may
not,
but
the
context
is
this,
your
honor.
you
have
five
section
5
courts
who
were
trying
to
analyze
why
did
the
submitting
jurisdiction
make
a
change?
what
was
the
purpose
behind
that
change?
and
they
are
examining
all
the
circumstantial
and
direct
evidence
relating
to
the
change.
the
justice
department
in
all
five
of
those
cases
and
here
says,
don't
just
look
at
what
was
motivating
the
board
at
the
time.
we
also
want
you
to
consider
all
of
this
additional
section
2
evidence,
as
they're
arguing
here.
we
want
you
to
consider
racial
bloc
voting
in
prior
elections.
and
the
district
courts
in
section
5
cases
have
consistently
responded
to
the
justice
department,
section
5
has
a
much
more
limited
purpose.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
oh,
no.
no,
not
at
all.
i
think
that
decision,
the
court's
decision
in
richmond
and
pleasant
grove
has
already
decided
that
issue
and,
indeed,
since
it
was
stipulated
that
it
didn't
even
have
the
effect
of
retrogression,
you
can
obviously
assume
they
didn't
have
the
purpose
to
retrogress,
and
this
would
have
been
a
one-paragraph
opinion.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
even
though
you're
not
making
things
worse,
we
can
conceive
of
circumstances
where
there's
a
fully
reasonable
alternative
put
in
front
of
you
that
preserves
black
concentrations
pursuant
to
traditional
districting
principles,
but
nonetheless,
because
you
are
a
racist
school
board
you
say,
no,
we're
not
going
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
what
the
district
court
did.
appellants
have
now
changed
their
opinion
as
to
the
legal
standard
applying.
let
me
proceed
in
two
steps.
the
district
court,
in
analyzing
whether
or
not
two
nonretrogressive
plans
reflect
discriminatory
purposes,
compares
the
maximizing
alternative
to
the
plan
adopted
and
again
asks,
do
we
have
a
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
purpose?
there
is
an
impact
here.
one's
got
black
majority
districts,
one
does
not.
now,
what
the
appellants
are
asking
the
district
court
to
do
is,
after
they've
figured
out
whether
that
impact
is
motivated
by
a
discriminating
purpose,
go
ahead
and
analyze
racial
bloc
voting.
well,
what
would
that
show
you?
all
racial
bloc
voting
is
relevant
to
is
whether
the
black
majority
districts
have
an
impact.
if
you
have
no
racial
bloc
voting,
if
you
have
no
history
of
discrimination
that
currently
excludes
blacks,
then
there's
no
difference,
as
this
court
noted
in
johnson
v.
degrandy,
between
white
majority
districts
and
black
majority
districts.
blacks
can
be
elected
in
both
districts.
so
if
the
district
court
had
gone
on
this
detour
that
appellants
insist
they...
insist
it
do,
and
agreed
with
them
entirely,
it
would
have
returned
to
precisely
the
place
it
started,
which
is,
yes,
the
naacp
plan,
the
failure
to
adopt
it
has
an
impact,
but
the
relevant
question
under
section
5
is
whether
that
was
motivated
by
a
discriminatory
purpose.
you
see,
all
of
the
confusion
comes
here
is
because
they
keep
quoting
cases
where
plaintiffs,
minority
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
and,
of
course,
in
section
5
the
burden
is
reversed.
so
yes,
in
rogers
v.
lodge
and
gingles
and
all
of
those
cases,
plaintiffs
must
prove
racial
bloc
voting.
they
must
prove
that
you
can
create
a
compact
black
majority
district,
and
then
they
must
show
that
the
failure
to
do
so
has
an
effect,
and
as
justice
brennan
noted
quite
clearly
in
gingles,
it
only
has
an
effect
if
there
is
racial
bloc
voting.
so
that
is
plaintiff's
burden
and,
if
they
had
the
burden
in
the
court
below,
they
would
have
had
to
show
that,
but
we
had
the
burden,
and
we
were
making
a
much
simpler
argument.
we
were
saying,
fine,
the
plan
has
an
impact,
but
that's
not
the
reason
it
did
it...
didn't...
took
the
police
jury
plan
over
the
naacp
plan.
we
took
the
police
jury
plan
over
the
naacp
plan
because
the
naacp
plan
clearly
and
irretrievably
violated
state
law.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
oh,
i--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--your
honor,
again,
as
appellants
have
correctly
pointed
out,
the
board
was
aware
of
the
impact
of
this
plan.
i
mean,
they
can
count.
they
knew
that
the
naacp
plan
had
two
black
majority
districts
and
their
plan
had
none.
nobody's
disputing
that
they
were
aware
of
the
impact
of
this
plan.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes,
but...
okay.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
right.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
right.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
and
how
would
that
inquiry
be
aided
by
looking
at
regression
analysis
of
racial
elections
that
was
done
3
years
after
the
board's
decision?
they
brought
in
an
expert
to
go
through
and
produce
this
evidence
of
racial
bloc
voting
which,
by
the
way,
it
failed
to
produce
and,
of
course,
this
plan
has
elected
two
black
people--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no.
again,
it
is
not
irrelevant,
particularly
when
plaintiffs
have
a
burden,
but
it
adds
nothing
to
what--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it
was
superfluous
and
cumulative
because
racial
bloc
voting
only
tells
you,
again,
whether
black
majority
districts
have
an
impact.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
sure.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
oh,
sure,
and
remember
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
court
committed
legal
error.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
it
said,
i
am
considering
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
purpose.
no,
your
honor,
it
didn't
say
what
it's
implicit
assumptions
were,
just
like
this
court
in
miller.
this
court
in
miller
analyzed
a
section
5
purpose
case,
and
it
compared
the
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reasons
for
adopting
the
plan
with
less
majority
black
districts
than
the
plan
with
more
majority
black
districts.
the
justice
department
in
that
brief
urged
upon
them
to...
in
this
court
to
independently
consider
the
stark
evidence
of
racial
bloc
voting
in
georgia
and
the
history
of
discrimination
and
all
those
sorts
of
things.
now,
the
court
didn't
do
that
because,
like
the
court
below,
it
assumed
that--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--the
absence
of
the
majority
districts
had
an
impact.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
it--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well...
well,
but
in
that
technical
sense,
as
this
court
has
already
pointed
out,
the
court
didn't
rule
it
was
irrelevant.
it
admitted
it
into
evidence,
and--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right.
you
must
still
consider
evidence
of
a
section
2
violation.
now,
that
means
that
section
5
courts
trying
to
figure
out
the
purpose
of
this
discrete
change
must
engage
in
the
amorphous
and
very
complicated
analysis
of
whether...
not,
the
change
is
purposefully
discriminatory,
but
whether
the
underlying
electoral
system
has
the
result
of
discriminating.
it
therefore
must
analyze
racial
bloc--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
and,
of
course,
they
do.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
sure.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
absolutely.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
if
the
court
had
said,
we
are
not
going
to
consider
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
both
section
2
and
section
5,
you
would
be
correct.
but
what
the
court
said
was,
we'll
consider
evidence
that's
relevant
to
section
5
but
not
relevant
only
to
a
section
2
violation.
how
do
the
two
statutes
differ?
one
has
a
purpose
standard,
and
one
has
a
result
standard.
some
evidence
of
section--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
they
both
have
that
in
common,
but
how
do
they
differ?
they
differ
because
section
2
can
be
violated
wholly
without
regard
to
purpose
and,
therefore,
the
evidence
for
a
section
2
violation
has
been
consciously
constructed
to
focus
the
court's
inquiry
not
on
the
purpose
for
adopting
this
plan
but
on
the
results
of
the
system,
racial
bloc
voting
and
those
sorts
of
things,
and
it
was
that
subset
of
evidence
that
the
court
clearly
said
was
the
only
evidence
it
wasn't--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--the
error
has...
no.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
argument
was,
in
that
court
and
this
court--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--we--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it
would
be
relevant
but
superfluous.
therefore,
what
section
5
courts
should
do
is
not
exclude
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
pay
attention
to
it
only
if
it
furthers
the
inquiry.
what
appellants
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they
must
always
consider
racial
bloc
voting,
and
my
question
again
is,
how
does
that
further
the
analysis?
you
have
just
gone
through
a
comparison
of
a
plan
that
you
assume
is
better
for
black
voters
compared
to
one
that
you
have
assumed
is
not
good
for
black
voters,
and
you've
found
it
is
legal
because
it's
not
motivated
by
a
discriminatory
purpose.
now,
you
could
spend
20
or
so
pages
discussing
the
extraordinarily
voluminous
evidence
showing
that,
indeed,
plans
with
black
majority
districts
are
better
for
black
voters,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
as
a
matter
of
law
should
rule
that
section
5
courts
must
engage
in
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i
think--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--your
honor,
i
had
understood
this
court's
rule
to
be
that
ambiguities
would
be
resolved
in
favor
of
district
courts.
rogers
v.
lodge
is
a
perfect
example
of
that.
rogers
v.
lodge
did
not
apply
this
court's
subsequent
decision
in
mobile
v.
bolden,
but
the
court
did
a
very
searching
analysis
and
said,
could
the
district
court
have
applied
the
purpose
test
under
mobile
v.
bolden,
and
therefore
it
gave
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
i
would
submit,
however,
in
the
context,
and
given
the
language,
that
this
court
did
not
make
the
ruling
that
appellants
said.
i--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--sure.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes,
your
honor,
of
course.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
of
course.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
your
honor,
if
there
was
any
evidence
of
fracturing
in
this
case,
i
think
that
would
not
be
my
reasonable
inference.
there
was
no
evidence
of
fracturing
based...
your
honor,
if
they
had
fractured
black
concentrations
in
bossier
parish
to
create...
to
fail
to
create
the
black
majority
districts,
then
obviously
appellants'
job
would
be
real
easy.
all
they
would
have
to
do
is
re...
undo
the
fracture,
and
redraw
the
lines
to
create
the
black
majority
districts.
but
we
know
that's
not
what
occurred
because
if
you
look
at
the
maps,
no
one
redrew--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--and
the
appellants
try
and
make
something
very
sinister
about
the
adoption
of
the
police
jury
plan.
the
consistent,
contemporaneous
evidence
has
been
that
they
rejected
the
naacp
plan
because
it
violated
state
law,
and
they
adopted
the
police
jury--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
whether
it
was
a
work
in
progress
or
a
final
plan,
the
point
is
that
it
is
stipulated
that
it
is
impossible
to
create
even
a
single
black
majority
district
without
splitting
a
precinct,
and
it
is
also
quite
clear
from
louisiana--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
and
appellants
have
confused
this
issue,
and
it's
very
important
that
the
court
be
clear
on
it.
the
police
jury
had
no
power
under
state
law
to
split
any
precincts.
it
was
a
facial
violation
for
the
police
jury
to
split
a
precinct.
it
was
a
facial
violation
for
the
board
to
split
a
precinct.
that
is
on
joint
appendix
at
277.
the
law
could
not
be
clearer
under
louisiana.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
because
from
april
1,
'91
through
may
15,
1991
police
juries
can
split
precincts.
the
board
here
asked
to
work
with
the
police
jury
at
that
time
so
they
could
split
the
precincts
in
april
and
may
of
1991.
that's
stipulated.
the
police
jury
rejected
the
overture.
after
may
15,
1991,
it
was
impossible
for
the
police
jury
to
split
precincts
or
the
board
to
split
precincts,
and
that
is
because
that
window
of
opportunity
that
the
state
legislature
had
consciously
given
to
police
juries
so
they
could
account
for
the
'90
redistricting
was
now
gone.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
that's
joint
appendix
277,
justice
scalia,
and
it
says,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
the
law,
the
precinct
boundaries
shall
not
be
divided,
abolished,
consolidated,
or
the
boundaries
otherwise
changed
until
after
december
31,
1992.
now,
could
the
board
have
waited
until
after
december
31,
1992
to
do
its
redistricting
as
appellants
contend?
the
answer
to
that
is
found
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
65.
the
united
states'
own
chronology
of
events
states
quite
explicitly
at
the
top
of
65,
12/31/92...
of
course,
the
same
date...
date
under
louisiana
law
by
which
school
boards
must
reapportion.
so
during
the
time
that
the
school
board
was
legally
obliged
to
reapportion,
the
police
jury
and
the
board
were
legally
prohibited
from
splitting
a
single
precinct.
that
law
is
not,
unfortunately,
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
it
is
louisiana
revised
statutes
at
17:
71.5a.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
your
honor,
because
of
the
window
of
opportunity.
you
see,
the
logic
of
the
law
is
this.
you
get--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i
took
your
question
to
mean,
could
they
make
adjustments
for
the
1990
census,
but
i
may
be
misunderstanding--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--oh,
in
order
to...
i
now
understand.
in
order
to
achieve--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right,
but
there
was
no
violation,
i
don't
believe,
of
the
one-person-one-vote
constitutional
standard.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
oh,
i
believe
there's
an
exception
in
the
law
for
boards
with
different
numbers
of
members
than
police
juries
to...
they
may
split
a
precinct
to
come
within
plus
or
minus
five
in
terms
of
ideal
population
deviation,
but
there
was
no
argument--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i
thought
mahan
v.
howe
used
that
as
even
just
a
presumptive
guideline.
in
congressional
redistricting
you
must
be
much
clearer.
i
had
understood
this
court's
decisions
in
mahan
and
others
to
give
local
and
state
jurisdictions
much
broader
discretion.
as
long
as
within...
it
was
within...
roughly
within
10
percent,
then
everything
was
okay,
and
even...
i
think
mahan
went
to
about
16.4,
and
they
did
that
to
preserve
the
town
boundary
and
here,
so
if
you
have
to
preserve
a
precinct
boundary
i
think
you'd
also
be
okay
under
law,
now
that
i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--mm-hmm.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
it
is
highly
relevant.
the
court
looked
at
the
naacp
as
an
alternative,
and
then
asked
itself
the
question,
the
proportionate
plan,
was
this
alternative
objectively
reasonable,
and
was
the
board's
rejection
of
it
motivated
by
discriminatory
purpose,
and
in
doing
so,
just
to
eliminate
any
ambiguity
on
this,
it
went
through
precisely
the
analysis
that
this
court
articulated
in
arlington
heights.
it
did
not
cite
arlington
heights
by
name,
i
agree.
the
court
had
noted
earlier
on
in
its
opinion
citing
cases
where
minority
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
makes
it
confusing
when
you're
dealing
with
a
section
5
case
where,
of
course,
the
burden
is
on
the
other
side,
so
it
cited
this
court's
voting
rights
cases
of
city
of
richmond
and
mccain
v.
lybrand,
the
purpose
cases
under
section
5.
but
if
i
could
briefly
go
through
the
arlington
heights
factors,
did
it
look
at
the
specific
sequence
of
events?
there
is
a
heading
in
the
court's
opinion
that
says,
we'll
now
look
at
the
specific
sequence
of
events.
did
it
look
at
the
contemporary
statements
of
the
affected
board
members?
it
spends
about
two
pages
walking
through
what
it
ultimately
concluded
were
these
ambiguous
statements
by
other
board
members.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
sure.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
your
honor,
to
be
candid,
i
don't
think
what
people
look
at,
what
district
courts
look
at
in
discriminatory
purpose
cases
is
a
very
complicated
inquiry.
i
mean,
i
think
they
looked
at
the
direct
and
circumstantial
evidence
of,
why
did
the
board
do
this,
and
do
we
believe
them,
and
is
it
objectively
reasonable?
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
so
i
really
must
insist
that
the
appellants
here
are
really
seeking
to
elevate
form
over
substance.
they're
seeking
to
require
district
courts
to
recite
the
blazingly
obvious.
we're
now
looking
at
the
black
majority
district,
and
we're
looking
at
the
other
plan.
the
black
majority
plan,
if
it's
not
chosen,
has
an
impact.
the
court
didn't
do
that
in
miller.
i
don't
know
of
any
purpose
case
that
does--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--oh,
sure,
and...
but
i
don't
think
they
think
they
can
win
the
clearly
erroneous
argument,
because
no
race-blind
actor
would
have
behaved
in
any
way
different
from
this
board.
again,
the
naacp
plan
violated
state
law.
the
police
jury
plan
did
not.
even
assuming
there
was
this
loophole
that
appellants
talked
about,
you
could
only
make
the
naacp
comply
with
state
law
by
going
to
the
police
jury,
taking
some
affirmative
steps.
the
argument
to
the
police
jury
for
complying
with
state
law
would
have
been
objectively
irrational.
it
would
have
been,
we'd
now
like
you
to
create
65
additional
precincts
in
a
district
with
56
precincts.
no
rational
person
would
have
taken
the
naacp
plan
if
you
were
blind
to
the
racial
composition,
so
their
clearly
erroneous
case
reduces
to
the
proposition
that
it's
not
plausible
to
believe
that
this
board
did
the
only
rational
thing
for
rational
reasons.
you
must
conclude,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
this
board
did
the
rational
thing
for
a
racial
purpose.
i
concede
that
that
is
conceivable,
but
i
don't
think
it's
grounds
for
finding
the
district
court's
contrary
conclusion
clearly
erroneous,
particularly
since,
again,
it
was
a
facial
violation.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
your
honor,
school
districts
represents
parents
and
children,
they
don't
represent
buildings.
it
was
never
a
redistricting
criteria
in
bossier
parish
to
have
a
school
building
in
each
district.
mrs.
jackson's
testimony
below
was
that
under
the
1980
plan,
the
old
plan,
she
did
not
have
a
building
in
her
district.
it
is
stipulated
that
well
before
the
naacp
plan
ever
came
into
existence
they
did
not
provide
their
cartographer,
mr.
joiner,
with
school
attendance
zones,
so--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--that
is
what
the
appellants
are
attributing
to
them,
and
there
is
a
stipulation
that
school
boards
typically
look
at
that,
but
the
undisputed
evidence
is,
this
school
board
did
not
care
about
that,
and
we
know
that
to
a
certainty,
because
it
didn't
give
their
line-drawer
any
evidence
of
where
the
school
buildings
were,
so--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--and
the
incumbency
paled
in
significance
to
the
advantages
of
the
police
jury
plan
for
guaranteeing
preclearance.
pairs
of
incumbents
are,
of
course,
only
a
problem
if
both
incumbents
are
going
to
run
again.
there
was
two
pairs
of
incumbents
here.
but
the
evidence
again,
by
mr.
musgrove
at
trial,
by
mr.
harvey
at
trial,
and
by
ms.
jackson,
again
in
a
deposition--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--thank
you.
