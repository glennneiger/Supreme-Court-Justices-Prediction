are
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
you
certain
that
the
district
court
here
meant
to
exclude
evidence
that
he
called
relevant
to
the
section
2,
meant
to...
was
he
saying,
i'm
not
even
going
to
consider
that
when
i
think
about
whether
section
5
is
violated,
or
is
he
saying,
you
can't
build
a
section
5
case
out
of
only
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
everybody
agrees
on
that,
if
everybody
agrees
that
the
purpose
is
really
the
purpose
to
cause
discrimination,
not
just
the
purpose
not
to
retrogress,
if
everybody
agrees
at
least
sometimes
a
lot
of
this
section
2
evidence
in
this
case
would
be
relevant,
if
not
dispositive...
not
necessarily
dispositive
but
relevant
to
showing
that,
and
all
we're
arguing
about
is
how
ambiguous
the
district
court's
opinion
is,
why
don't
we
just
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
work
it
out
and
say,
be
clear,
take
it
into
account
and
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
your...
your
argument,
which
is
a
very
good
argument
as
to
why
there
was
no
purpose
that
violated
section
5,
not
show...
in
order
to
see
whether
you're
right
or
not
we
ought
to
introduce
all
the
other
evidence.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
the
other
side
they
say
that
here
are
all
these
people
on
this
board,
which
at
that
time
had
had
only
a
black
member
for
a
very
short
period
of
time.
they
didn't
want
the
police
jury
district
because
they'd
have
to
run
against
each
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
didn't
want
the
police
district
for
some
reasons
that
then
later
on
they
just
ignored,
and
what
happened
in
between?
what
happened
in
between
was
that
the
naacp
got
busy
and
began
to
talk
about
a
more
proportionate
system,
so
why
isn't
whether
there
could
have
been
a
more
proportionate
system
or
had
to
be
a
more
proportionate
system
highly
relevant?
