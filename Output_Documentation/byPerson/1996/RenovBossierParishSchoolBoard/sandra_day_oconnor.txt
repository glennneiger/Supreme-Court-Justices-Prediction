justice

has
this
court
applied
arlington
heights
in
a
section
5
determination,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
had
not,
but
what
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
we
do
if
we're
truly,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
uncertain
what
it
is
the
district
court
really
excluded
from
consideration,
if
it's
unclear
to
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
have
to
remand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
law
consistent
with
one-person-one-vote
requirements,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
is
such
a
state
law
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
one
person,
one
vote
in
drawing
districts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking,
this
court
has
had
several
opinions
that
have
required
the
utilization
of
the
principle
of
one
person,
one
vote
in
districting
for
whatever
purpose,
if
it's
for
voting,
a
police
jury
or
a
school
board
that
votes,
and
so
forth,
so
is
it
consistent
with
that
principle
for
a
state
law
to
say,
you
can't
ignore
a
precinct
boundary?
what
if
you
have
to
in
order
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--draw
equal
districts
and
achieve
that
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking,
if
it
were,
do
you
think
that
state
law
could
prevail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
this
court
said
plus
or
minus
five
is
okay?
