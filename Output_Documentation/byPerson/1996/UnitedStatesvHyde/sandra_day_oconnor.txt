justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
there
seems
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
interchangeability
of
these
terms
in
appellate
opinions,
acceptance
of
a
plea,
or
acceptance
of
a
plea
agreement.
in
fact,
until
this
case
came
along
i
don't
think
i
had
ever
focused
on
the
fact
that
there
might
be
a
difference
in
the
two.
we
tend
to
think
of
a
plea
as
a
plea
agreement,
and
vice
versa.
how
often
is
it
that
these
two
are
separated,
the
entry
of
a
plea
and
a
subsequent
plea
agreement,
if
you
will?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
how
often
is
it
that
the
district
court
has
to
separate
the
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
judge
decides
not
to
accept
the
plea
agreement
by
virtue
of
what
the
judge
reads
in
the
presentence
report,
the
rules
permit
the
defendant
to
withdraw
from
the
plea.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
no
fair
and
just
reason
for
the
withdrawal
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
soglin,
i
thought
rule
32
had
some
bearing
on
the
case,
that
says
if
a
motion
to
withdraw
a
plea
of
guilty
is
made
before
sentence
is
imposed,
the
court
may
permit
the
plea
to
be
withdrawn
if
the
defendant
shows
any
fair
and
just
reason.
why
doesn't
that
govern
what
happens
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
judge
said
he'd
accepted
the
plea
but
he
hasn't
made
a
decision
on
the
plea
agreement,
and
the
government
says
there's
a
difference
between
the
two.
you
say
there's
no
difference
between
the
two.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
opposed
to
the
plea
agreement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
talking...
now
we're
dealing
with
two
separate
things,
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
a
separate
plea
agreement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
judge
said
that
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
somehow
the
rules
don't
permit
a
separation
of
a
plea
of
guilty
and
a
plea
agreement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
reversal
because
we
don't
agree
with
you.
