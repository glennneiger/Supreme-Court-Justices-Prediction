justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
have
to
go
against
the
text
of
rule
11(e)
to
do
that,
to
take
your
position,
and
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
is
this.
i'm
reading...
i'm
actually
reading
from
the
rule
as
it's
set
out
on
4a
of
the
back
of
the
government's
brief.
whereabouts,
justice
souter?
the
first
paragraph,
right
at...
it's
the
carryover
paragraph
at
the
beginning.
if
the
agreement
is
of
the
charge-bargaining
or
the
definite
sentence
type,
the
court
may
accept
or
reject
the
agreement,
or
may
defer
its
decision
until
there's
been
an
opportunity
to
accept
the
presentence
report.
it's
clear
from
that
that
the
court
does
accept
the
agreement,
may,
and
effectively
may
under
the
rule,
without
waiting.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
under
the...
in
the
following
sentence,
if
the
agreement
is
of
the
type
specified
in
subdivision
(b),
the
court
may
advise...
shall
advise
the
defendant
that
if
the
court
does
not
accept
the
recommendation...
i.e.,
that
which
is
part
of
the
agreement...
the
defendant
nevertheless
has
no
right
to
withdraw.
so
in
each
of
those
instances,
the
(a),
the
(b),
and
the
(c)
instance,
the
rule
provides
explicitly,
as
i
read
it,
for
acceptance
of
the
plea
without
regard
to
what
may
ultimately
happen
to
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
there
are,
of
course,
further
provisions
in
the
(a)
and
(b)
type,
and
there's
a
further
provision,
just
cause,
for
the...
(a)
and
(c)
type
and
just
cause
provision
for
the
(b)
type,
but
the
text
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
the
court
may
operatively
accept
the
agreement
right
then
and
there,
and
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
your
point
that
the
court
has
got
to
use
the
magic
word,
accept?
is
that
what
you
think
the
case
turns
on,
as
distinct
from
the
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
employed?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
a
different
question.
do
you
defend
the
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
until
the
final
determination
is
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
terms
of
the
plea
agreement
will
be
honored,
there
is,
in
fact,
nothing
binding
upon
the
defendant,
and
the
defendant
can
simply
either
withdraw
or
say,
oh,
well,
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
are
you
defending
that
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
is
that
position
consistent
with
the
text
that
we
just
went
over
from
(e),
which
seems
to
me
to
say
quite
clearly
that
the
plea
can
be
accepted
by
the
court
even
though
the
terms
of
the
plea
agreement
may
or
may
not
be
honored,
and
there
being
various
consequences
that
follow
if
they
are
not,
but
the
text
of
the
rule
seems
very
clear
that
the
court
may
accept
the
plea,
even
though
we
don't
yet
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
terms
of
the
plea
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
says,
may
accept
or
reject,
in
the
one
sentence
and
in
the
other
it
says,
the
court
shall
advise
the
defendant
that
if
the
court
does
not
accept
the
recommendation
or
request
of
the
defendant,
the
defendant
nevertheless
has
no
right
to
withdraw
the
plea.
aren't
those
pretty
clear
indications
that
the
court
may
accept
the
plea
regardless
of
what
happens
later
to
the
terms
of
the
plea
agreement?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
would
say
in
the
(a)
and
(c)
cases,
even
if
the
judge
says
in
open
court
i
accept
the
plea,
but
i
will
determine
later
on
whether
i
will
accept
the
agreement,
and
i
will
wait
until
after
the
sentence
report,
the
judge's
statement
in
that
case
simply
is
not
effective.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
but
you
can
square
it
a
little
bit
with
the
language,
but
my
goodness,
i've
never
seen
anything
like
this
before,
where
the...
i've
never
seen
this,
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
before.
i
thought
that
the
basic
idea
of
this
whole
procedure
is
that
the
defendant
pleads
guilty,
the
judge
then
calls
for
the
presentence
report,
everybody
gets
a
chance
to
look
at
it,
you
know,
and
then
of
course
the
defendant's
bound
if
the
judge
accepts
it.
imagine
the
contrary.
the
contrary
would
be
the
defendant
would
sit
there,
he'd
say,
i
plead
guilty,
but
it
wouldn't
mean
anything.
now
i'm
going
to
get
a
really
good
chance
to
see
the
evidence
against
me.
i'm
going
to,
moreover,
get
a
perfect
chance
to
know
what
every
witness
has
said.
this
is
a
fabulous
discovery,
and
i
know
what
the
prosecution
will
have
said,
and
i
know
what
my...
i
know
everything.
maybe
that's
as
it
should
be,
but
this
is
still
something
of
a
change,
wouldn't
it
be,
to
have
the
total
presentence
report
available
to
everybody
prior
to
the
defendant
actually
being
bound?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
that's
a
good
idea.
i
don't
know.
or
maybe
it's
not.
but
it
would
represent
a
considerable
change,
wouldn't
it,
in
most
places?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
then
why
isn't
that
your...
why
doesn't
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't
that
the
interpretation?
why
isn't
that
what
would
happen
if
we
accepted
your
view
of
the
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
well,
the
guidelines
are
very
much
against
that,
aren't
they?
i
mean,
it's
very
hard
to
ask
a
judge
to
do
that
without
knowing
the
underlying
circumstances,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you
feel
about
the
opposite,
because
i
guess
if
the
defendant
is
free
to
withdraw,
so
could
the
government,
and
now
what
the
government's
going
to
do
is
get
a
really
nice
look
not
only
at
its
own
evidence
but
get
quite
a
nice
look
at
what
the
defendant's
going
to
go
and
present
to
the
probation
officer,
you
know,
by
way
of
excuse,
mitigation,
and
everything.
then
the
government
reads
all
that
and
says,
oh,
by
the
way,
we
changed
our
mind.
i
take
it
that
would
not
be
something
you'd
particularly
like,
but
again,
sauce
for
the
goose,
sauce
for
the
gander.
you'd
have
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
has
he
relied,
on
your
view?
it
seems
to
me
his
reliance
is
absolutely
free
on
your
view,
because
he
can
withdraw,
and
i
presume
you're
not
conceding
that
anything
he
had
said
in
the
plea
colloquy
can
be
used
against
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
he
hasn't
given
up
much.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.--
--so
your...
is
it
your
argument
that
what
the
defendant
has
partially
performed
is
sort
of
the
equivalent
of
what
the
government
would
be
disclosing
in
the
presentence
report,
so
that
therefore
it's
perfectly
fair
for
the
defendant
to
be
able
to
wait
until
the
presentence
report
is
in
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
withdraw
his
plea?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
that
your
argument?
i
just
want
to
know
if
i'm
understanding
your
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
question
that
justice
breyer
raised
was,
if
the
defendant
may
withdraw
at
will
under
a
rule
like
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
then
the
defendant
can
sit
back
and
wait
for
a
presentence
report,
which
is
in
fact
going
to
be
there
before
the
judge
sentences
in
almost
every
case,
and
if
the
deal
is
not
final
by
the
time
he
reads
the
report,
he
could
simply
withdraw
his
plea.
and
i
thought
that
you...
and
the
implication
being
that
would
be
a
very
strange
system
for
the
rules
to
provide,
because
that
would
give
the
defendant
a
terrific
advantage
in
discovery,
and
i
thought
your
argument
was,
well,
the
defendant
is
partially
performing
simply
by
standing
up
and
going
through
the
plea
colloquy.
the
defendant
is
giving
the
government
something
which
it
might
use
as
a
lead
to
further
investigation
and
so
on,
and
so
therefore
it's
perfectly
fair
for
the
defendant
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
plea
agreement
if
the
government
gets
the
benefit
of
this
partial
performance,
and
i
thought
that
was
the
ultimate
point
that
you
were
making.
is...
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
textually
it
clearly
does
in
the
one
instance.
i
mean,
there's
an
express
provision
that
says
the
judge
will
tell
him
that
if
i
don't
ultimately
follow
the
recommendation...
i.e.,
in
a
(b)
situation...
you
still
can't
withdraw
the
plea,
so
clearly
there
is
an
irrefutable
textual
basis
for
saying
that
he
can
accept
the
plea
leaving
the
plea
agreement
in
limbo
in
that
circumstance,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
an
(a)
and
(c)
situation
the
defendant
has
an
absolute
right
to
withdraw
his
plea
if,
in
fact,
the
charge
part
of
the
agreement
or
the
absolute
sentence
part
of
the
agreement
is
not
kept,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
doesn't
that
imply
that
in
those
situations,
too,
the
plea
can
operatively
be
accepted?
otherwise
there
would
be
no
need
for
those
provisions,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
provisions
for
withdrawal
of
the
pleas
if,
in
fact,
the
agreements
are
not
accepted
and
kept.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
answer
to
that
may
be,
just
as
justice
scalia
said,
a
plea
is
a
plea,
and
once
it's
there,
it's
operative
unless,
in
fact,
it
is
subject
to
one
of
these
withdrawal
or
reexamination
provisions.
