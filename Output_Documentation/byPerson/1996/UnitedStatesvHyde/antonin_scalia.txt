why
is
it
a
contract
analogy?
why
isn't
it
just
a
contract?
there's
consideration
on
both
sides,
it
seems
to
me.
the
government's
made
a
promise.
the
defendant's
made
a
promise.
and
if
you're
right
about
the
fact
that
this
guilty
plea
is
not
withdrawable,
it's
detriment
that
can't
be
undone.

mr.
soglin,
can
i
take
you
back
to
rule
32(e)?
was
it
your
assertion
that
the
government
concedes
that
that
only
applies
when...
after
the
plea
has
been
accepted?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
you
say
tenders
a
plea,
does
it
talk
about
tendering
a
plea
here?
i
mean,
you
plead
guilty.
you
either
plead
guilty
or
you
don't
plead
guilty.
i
don't
know
whether
you
tender
it.
justice

scalia
the
reality
is
that
will
never
happen.
they're...
you're
not
even...
even
perjury
prosecutions
for
obstruction
of
justice
are
pretty
rare.
this
won't
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
best
textual
support
for
your
position?
what
is
the
provision
of
the
rules
that
you
think
is
the
one--
