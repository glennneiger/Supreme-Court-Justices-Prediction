mr.
feldman,
there's
one
difference.
your
opponent
argues...
i
don't
know
how
significant
it
is...
that
in
the
scenario
you
give,
the
difference
is
the
judge
will
have
seen
the
presentence
report
before
the
trial,
which
normally
is
not
desirable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you're
overlooking
one
thing.
the
defendant
can
withdraw
with
fair
and
just
reason
to
do
so.
why
couldn't
the
government
come
in
and
say,
we
have
a
fair
and
just
reason.
we
found
out
this
guy's
much
worse
than
we
thought
he
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is
if
it's
an
equal
balance,
both
rights
are
the
same,
the
government
does
have
some
right
to
withdraw,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled
as
to
your
position.
are
you
saying
that
at
the
time
when
the
judge
makes
his
ruling
on
whether
to
accept
it
or
not
the
government
is...
open
to
the
government
to
argue
you
should
reject
this
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
thought
you
suggested--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
feldman,
do
you
happen
to
know
off
the
top
of
your
head
what
percentage
of
convictions
in
the
federal
system
are
on
guilty
pleas
and
how
many
after
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
over
90
percent
still,
isn't
it?
