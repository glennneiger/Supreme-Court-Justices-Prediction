mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
determinative
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
district
court
can
accept
a
guilty
plea
before
it
approves
the
plea
agreement
upon
which
it
depends.
in
this
case
and
in
its
earlier
suit
in
cordova-perez,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
recognized
that
a
plea
and
a
plea
agreement
are
so
inextricably
bound
up
together
that
deferral
of
acceptance
of
one
carries
with
it
the
deferral
of
acceptance
of
the
other.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
rule
permits
the
judge
to
accept
the
agreement
at
the
time
of
the
plea
hearing,
rule
11
hearing,
or
may
defer
its
decision
until
later.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
whether
it's
going
to
do
that
is
going
to
depend
on
the
information
available
at
that
time,
and
the
petitioner
has
argued
that
deferral
is
required
in
these
cases,
type
(a)
charge-bargain,
or
type
(c)
sentence
stipulation
agreements,
such
that
where
there's
deferral
in
all
of
these
cases,
that
in
none
of
those
cases
can
the
judge
accept
the
agreement
earlier
and
thus
rule
32(e)'s
fair
and
just
standard
disappears
for
that
period
of
time.
that's
not
necessarily
required.
the
rules,
particularly
rule
32,
permits
the
judge
in
fact
to
sentence
a
defendant
without
a
presentence
report,
and
there's
certainly
authority
the
judge
can
accept
the
plea
agreement.
the
rules
permit
it
without
the
presentence
report,
and
at
that
time,
if
the
presentence
report
is
not
needed
the
judge
can
say,
i
accept
your
plea
agreement,
and
at
that
time
the
defendant
is
bound.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
i
think
what
it
turns
on
is
when
the
judge
can
accept
the
plea,
as
opposed
to
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
justice
souter,
i
think
i
would
disagree
that
the
rule
says
that
the
court
could
accept
the
plea
in
that
section.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
only
with
the
type
(b)
agreements.
in
the
first
sentence
that
you
referred
to
it
refers
to,
the
court
may
accept
or
reject
the
agreement.
with
type
(a)
and
type
(c)
agreements...
those
are
the
charge-bargain
agreements
and
sentencing
stipulation
agreements...
those
are
the
types
the
court
may
defer
acceptance
to
the
agreement.
with
the
type
(b)
agreements
that
are
referred
to
in
the
second
sentence,
there
is
no
moment
for
the
judge
to
approve
of
the
agreement.
approval
of
the
plea
carries
with
it
approval
of
the
agreement
in
a
case
of
the
type
(b)
sentencing
recommendation
agreement.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
it's
not
effective
to
the
extent
the
judge
purports
to
bind
the
defendant
to
that
plea.
it
may
be
effective
to
the
extent
the
judge
has
made
findings
that
the
plea
has
been
entered
knowingly
and
voluntarily.
the
judge
has
gone
through
the
litany
of
determining
whether
it's
knowing
and
voluntary.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
has
agreed...
and
this
is
referred
to
in
their
reply
brief
on
page
9...
that
that
rule,
that
standard
in
rule
32(e)
only
applies,
or
applies
where
there
is
a
tendered
and
accepted
plea.
we've
argued
that
there
has
been
no
accepted
plea,
although
the
judge
purported
to
do
so.
her
label--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--there's
certainly
a
difference
between
a
plea
and
an
agreement.
you
can
have
plea
without
an
agreement,
but
my
argument
is
that
you
can't
accept
one
without
the
other,
and
this
is
based
on
the
structure
of
rule
11.
that
rule
was
amended
in
1974.
for
the
first
time
that
rule
provided
that
the
court
could
do
what
we've
just
described,
which
is
defer
approval
of
the
agreement
pending
review
of
the
presentence
report.
to
make
that
review
possible,
rule
32
was
also
amended
to
permit
review
of
the
presentence
report
prior
to
a
conviction.
rule
32
had
already
allowed
the
review
of
the
presentence
report
submitted
to
the
judge,
reviewed
by
the
judge,
where
there
had
been
a
finding
of
guilt,
whether
by
a
guilty
plea
or
a
conviction
before
a
trial,
jury
trial.
if
the
judge
could
accept
the
plea
but
not
the
agreement,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
amend
rule
32
to
permit
that
early
review
of
the
presentence
report.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
if--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--if
that
were
the
response,
if
the
response
to
the
decision
were
to
produce
a
presentence
report
prior
to
the
rule
11
hearing,
prior
to
the
defendant
being
bound,
that
would
be
a
change.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
that's
not
necessarily
the
response.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
that's
one
possibility.
another
possibility
is
that
the
district
court
could
make
its
decision
on
whether
to
accept
the
plea
without
a
presentence
report.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
that's
correct.
i
think
at
the
time
the
rule
11
hearing
is
held,
though,
a
great
deal
of
information
is
known.
presumably
the
government
has
investigated
their
case--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--and
produced
discovery,
and
there's
a
great
deal
known
about
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
in
this
case,
mr.
hyde
is
charged
with
eight
counts
of
fraud.
he
pled
guilty
to
four
counts
of
fraud.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
i
would
not
like
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
required
result.
if
you
look
at
it
purely
as
two
equally
bargaining
parties,
that
would
be
the
logical
result
of
the
argument,
but
it's
not
necessarily
really
what
you
have.
defendants
are
not
your
true,
equally
or
fully
capably
negotiating
parties.
they're--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--there
are...
first
of
all,
there
is
no
parallel
provision
to
rule
32(e)...
or,
i'm
sorry,
to...
yes,
to
rule
32(e),
which
allows
defendant
to
withdraw
without
a
fair
and
just
reason.
there's
no
parallel
provision
for
that
for
the
government.
there's
a
recognition
in
that
that
there's
a
little
more
freedom
available
to
a
defendant
withdrawing
than
there
is
for
the
government.
the
government's
going
to
need
to
show
some
sort
of
breach
or
fraud.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
rule
32
doesn't
address
that
squarely.
i
think
there
are
some
lower
court
decisions
that--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--that's
correct.
when
a
defendant
is
offered
the
plea,
there's
been
some
sort
of
partial
performance
whether
that's
accepted
by
the
court
or
not.
the
defendant
has
come
into
court
and
said,
i'm
willing
to
waive
some
very
important
constitutional
rights.
and
on
top
of
that,
defendant
admits
the
conduct
that's
alleged.
to
that
extent,
defendant
has
to
some
degree
relied
on
the
agreement.
there
may
not
be
the
same
sort
of
reliance
by
the
government
at
that
stage.
the
government
very
often
does
not
have
to
perform
what
it's
promised
until
sentencing.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
it
could
be
used
in
limited
circumstances
in
a
trial
under
perjury,
but
that's
not
the
primary
concern.
the
petitioner
has
recognized--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--well,
petitioner
recognizes...
this
is
in
the
reply
brief
in
footnote
8...
that
such
information
could
be
used
in
other
ways.
even
if
it
can't
be
used
at
a
trial,
it
could
be
used
to
have...
let
the
government
think
about
other
investigations,
open
the
door
to
other
avenues.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
perhaps.
[laughter]
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
well,
the
reason
the
defendant's
free
to
withdraw
is--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--that's
right.
if
you
could
rephrase
it--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--that
was
the
point
i
was
making.
i
don't
think
that's
the
most
fair
situation.
truly,
that
is
not
what
is
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
is
not
something
that
the
court
necessarily
has
to
reach
in
deciding
this
case,
whether
the
government
would
be
free
to
withdraw
if
there's
been
some
sort
of
reliance
by
the
defendant.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
that's
correct.
the
government
is--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--correct.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
yes.
i
think
there
are
actually
three
things
that
could
be
meant
by
the
term,
plea
of
guilty.
it
could
be
a
defendant
tendering
a
plea...
as
petitioner
has
stated
there
are
circumstances
that
are
rare
where
a
defendant
tenders
a
plea
and
the
judge--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--where
a
defendant
says
i
plead
guilty
is
what
i've
been
referring
to
as
a
tendered
plea.
an
accepted
plea,
which
is
what
petitioner
has
stated
is
required
before
rule
32(e)
applies,
is
where
the
judge
says
i
accept
the
plea.
our
argument--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--the
judge
said
that
here.
our
argument
is
simply
that
the
judge
did
not
have
legal
authority
to
do
that.
looking
at
the
structure--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--that's
right.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
precisely.
i
think
that's
not
the
case
here.
this
case
involved
charge
dismissal
concessions
by
the
government
as
determining
the
plea,
such
that
there
was
a
requirement
the
judge
accept
the
agreement.
with
a
type
(b)
agreement,
there's
no
reason
for
the
judge
to
accept
the
agreement.
the
judge
has
ultimately
no...
there's
no
limitation
on
the
judge's
sentencing
discretion
under
a
purely
type
(b)
agreement,
where
the
prosecution
only
has
to
make
a
recommendation
as
to
the
ultimate
sentence.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
if
the
promise
is
not
kept.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
defendant
can
withdraw
it,
correct.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
the
provision
for
acceptance
of
the
agreement?
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
well,
the
provision
for
withdrawal
of
the
plea
in
rule
32(e)
doesn't
describe
whether
it's
talking
about
a
tendered
plea,
an
accepted
plea,
a
plea
where
both
the
plea
and
the
agreement
have
been
accepted.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
well,
again,
the
petitioner
has
conceded
that
that's
not
the
case,
and
i
think
the
answer
may
be
in
the
mabry
case
of
this
court,
where
the
court
held
that
the
agreement
is
not
binding
until
accepted
by
the
court,
and
in
that
case
it
was
a
situation
where
the
government
had
made
an
offer
which
defendant
accepted.
the
government
then
attempted
to
withdraw.
the
defendants
sought
enforcement
of
that
offer,
the
withdrawn
offer,
and
the
court
said
no,
you
hadn't...
that
offer
had
not
been
approved
by
the
court.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
it's
not
ephemeral
if
the
judge
accepts
the
plea
agreement,
which
the
judge
has
discretion
to
do.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
no,
the
rules
do
require
that
the
parties,
when
they
come
into
the
rule
11
proceeding
to
advise
the
court--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--the
rules
permit
the
judge
to
accept
it
earlier.
with
some
types
of
agreements
that's
very
possible.
in
this
case,
the
judge's
sentencing
authority
was...
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
limited
by
the
agreement.
there
was
agreement
to
plead
to
four
counts
of
an
eight-count
indictment
on
a
fraud
case.
the
maximum
sentence
under
the
charged
offenses
was
50
years.
the
maximum
sentence
under
the
plea
agreement
was
30
years.
under
the
rules,
the
guidelines
which
this
court
recognized
in
watt
as
recently
as
this
year,
the
court
can
consider
nonconvicted
conduct,
relevant
conduct,
so
all
of
that
conduct
that
was
part
of
this...
these
counts
can
be
considered
at
sentencing.
the
judge's
sentencing
authority
was
not
limited
in
any
respect
by
the
plea
agreement,
so
the
judge
could
accept
that
agreement
without
at
all
limiting
his
or
her
sentencing
authority
without
waiting
for
the
presentence
report,
and
that
may
be
the
case
in
many,
many
cases.
if
there
are
cases
where
there
is
reason
to
think
that
his
sentencing
discretion
is
going
to
be
limited
in
some
way,
where
there
is
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
that
might
be
eliminated,
or
where
there's
a
very
low
maximum
sentence
in
the
charged
or
the
pleaded-to
agreement
or
count,
that
there
would
be
significant
limits
on
the
judge's
sentencing
authority.
in
those
cases
the
judge
would
want
to
see...
may
want
to
see
the
presentence
report.
it's
possible
to
have
that
presentence
report
prepared
earlier.
the
rules
specifically
provide
for
that.
and
as
judge
stafford,
the
chief
judge
of
the
northern
district
of
florida
stated
in
an
article,
most
of
the
information
needed
is
available
at
that
time,
at
the
time
of
the
plea
hearing,
even
without
a
presentence
report,
so
there
are
many
instances
when
that
could
be
accepted.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
the
guidelines
do.
the
guidelines
use
mandatory
language.
the
rules
use
permissive
language.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
i
think
that
this
is
something...
rule
32,
which
talks
about
use
of
the
presentence
report
for
sentencing
as
opposed
to
acceptance
of
the
plea
agreement,
recognizes
you
don't
always
need
the
presentence
report.
the
judge
can
rely
on
the
record
if
the
judge
states
on
the
record
that
they
find
sufficient
information
on
the
record
to
sentence.
the
same
thing
would
apply
with
a
plea
agreement
the
judge--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--i
do
not
know
whether
they're
taking
any
action.
i
attempted
to
find
out
a
couple
of
weeks
ago.
i
learned
that
the
next
meeting
had
not
been
held
yet.
that
will
be
coming
up,
i
believe
it
was
april
8.
if
i'm
able
to
obtain
that
there
is
something
that
the
rules
committee
is
taking
up
with
that,
i
will
certainly,
with
the
court's
permission,
lodge
that
with
the
court
after
the
hearing,
but
that
does
raise
the
question
that,
can
this
be
dealt
with
in
some
other
way.
if
the
rule
has
not
addressed
the
situation,
if
the
guidelines
have
in
some
way
increased
the
frequency
with
which
judges
defer
approval
of
the
agreement
by
using
mandatory
language,
perhaps
the
way
to
resolve
the
conflict
is
to
have
the
sentencing
commission
take
another
look
at
this,
the
sentencing
commission
or
the
rules
committee
through
the
rules
amendment
proceedings.
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
or...
well,
i
mean,
the
other
option
would
be
a
dismissal,
a
finding
that
certiorari
had
been
improvidently
granted
on
the
ground
that--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--that's
their
losses.
[laughter]
i
just
want
to
address
for
a
moment
some
of
the
floodgates
arguments
that
the
government
has
made.
as
i
stated,
this
is
not...
does
not
apply
to
all
agreements.
there
are
agreements
that
don't
even
fall
under
the
types
addressed
by
the
rules.
there
are
cooperation
agreements
that
are
not
described
in
the
rules.
those
do
not
require
a
deferral
of
acceptance
of
agreements,
so
there
are
many
agreements
where
the
judge
can
accept
the
agreement
at
the
plea
hearing.
there
are
also
many
disincentives
for
a
defendant
to
back
out
of
an
agreement
the
way
the
government
has
suggested
will
happen
frequently,
or
to
use
it
for
delay.
defendants
want
speedy
trials.
there
are...
of
course,
of
course
the
speedy
trial
act
reflects
that
there
are...
is
an
interest
for
defendants
to
have
quick
resolution
of
these
cases.
if
a
defendant
does
seek
to
withdraw,
and
the
government
thinks
this
is
for
delay
or
it
obstructs
justice
in
some
way,
that
defendant
upon
going
to
trial
will
get...
will
lose
acceptance
of
responsibility
reduction,
which
is
a
three-level
reduction
in
sentence,
a
two
or
three-level
reduction
in
sentence,
sentencing
levels.
they
could
also
face
an
enhancement
for
obstruction
of
justice
under
the
guidelines,
or
a
separate
prosecution
for
obstruction
of
justice
if
they
are
using
this
somehow
to
manipulate
or
to
delay
the
proceedings
so
that
government
witnesses
are
lost.
the
reality
is--
mr.
jonathan
d.
soglin
--they
are
rare.
it
is
possible,
and
i
would
rely
more
on
the
loss
of
acceptance
of
responsibility,
which
is...
very
often
could
be
what
motivates
the
defendant
to
plead,
is
that
reduction,
which
can
be
significant,
up
to
20
percent,
30
percent
reduction
in
sentence,
which
they're
not
going
to
get
if
they
go
to
trial.
that's
a
tremendous
deterrent
in
defendants
withdrawing
from
these
pleas.
the...
finally,
the...
it's
been
mentioned
earlier
that
the
rate
of
conviction
by
plea
agreements,
by
guilty
pleas
is
90
percent,
or
has
been
over
90
percent.
it
has
been
that
high
for
quite
a
bit
of
time,
since...
at
least
since
the
1960's,
and
we
cited
some
reference
to
statistics
like
that,
so
there
are...
there's
a
great
deal
of
stability
in
guilty
pleas.
there
is...
if
something
significant
has
been
offered
to
defendant
they're
going
to
plead
guilty
and
they're
going
to
stick
with
that
plea.
it's
going
to
be
a
rare
defendant
who's
going
to
want
to
back
out
of
that.
it's...
a
point
of
emphasis.
the
question
here
is,
truly,
can
the
court
do
what
it
purported
to
do
in
this
case,
which
was
accept
the
guilty
plea
at
the
time
that
it
did.
the
rules,
the
structure
of
the
rules
show
that
they
cannot.
in
that
situation,
rule
32(e)
does
not
apply,
and
the
defendant
is
free
to
withdraw.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
