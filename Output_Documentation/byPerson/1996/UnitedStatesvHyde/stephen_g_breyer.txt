justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work
with
the
government?
that
is...
i
understand...
let's...
in
the
case
of
a
(b)
agreement
this
is
irrelevant
really.
i
see
that.
let's
imagine
it's
a
(c),
which
is
pretty
rare,
but
it's
clearer
conceptually.
all
right,
you
say
judge,
the
defendant
and
i
have
agreed
that
it's
going
to
be
5
years.
the
defendant
says
i
like
that.
i
plead
guilty.
i'm
the
judge.
i
say,
i'm
going
to
get
the
presentence
report.
so
i
go
read
it,
and
i
then,
having
read
it,
i
say
it's
okay
with
me.
everybody's
bound.
or
i
might
say,
no,
i
want
to
give
him
10
years,
in
which
case
the
defendant
can
go
and
withdraw
and
go...
i
understand
that.
between
those
two
times
of
him
having
pled,
i'm
guilty,
and
me,
the
judge,
having
read
the
report,
suppose
the
government
says,
we
don't
want
to
go
through
with
this
deal.
nobody's
told
us
in
the
briefs
that
obvious
question,
and
you
would
think
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
what
you're
saying
is
that
during
those
periods
of
time
the
defendant,
if
he
wants
to
get
out
of
this
deal
before
i
can
say
i
accept
it,
the
defendant
has
to
show
some
cause.
well,
i
assume
absolutely
the
same
is
true
of
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
wait...
the
opposite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i...
yes,
but
your
position--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
government
is
not
free
to
withdraw
during
that
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
just
want
to
be
sure...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
it
works
both
ways.
what
is
it
in
the
rules
that
prevents
the
government
from
withdrawing
during
that
period
of
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you
go
back
for
a
second
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
because
this
is
another
point
i'm
not
certain
about
from
the
briefs,
and
from
having
read
this.
imagine
we're
in
an
(a)
type
bargain.
that's
a
charge
bargain.
initially
there
weren't
supposed
to
be
very
many
of
those,
because
it
wasn't
supposed
to
make
a
difference
to
the
sentence,
but
i
guess
for
it
to
make
a
difference
to
the
sentence
you
have
to
be
in
a
drug
case,
what,
where
there's
a
mandatory
minimum,
or
where
you're
going
to
a
telephone
count
from
a
possession,
so
there
are
some
where
it
makes
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we're
in
one
of
those
circumstances.
now,
you,
the
government,
say
the
defendant
is
pleading
to
a
telephone
count.
do
you
do
that,
defendant?
yes.
now
time
passes,
and
i'm
the
judge,
and
i've
read
the
presentence
report.
i
say,
i
don't
accept
it.
what
does
that
mean?
what
does
that
mean,
i
don't
accept
it.
he's
pleaded
guilty.
does
it
mean
you're
free
to
reinstate
the
indictment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
you
decide
we're
not
going
to
reinstate
the
indictment,
that's
your
decision.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
can
make
me
take
the
telephone
count
by
changing
the
indictment
and
going...
can't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
cordova's
wrong.
that
ninth
circuit
case
is
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reasoning
is
wrong
because
it
said
they
could
force
the
defendant
to
change.
they
can't
force
the
defendant
to
change.
the
correct
thing
to
say
is,
defendant,
if
you
want
to
plead
guilty
to
the
telephone
count,
fine.
that's
your
business.
but
the
government's
free
to
go
ahead
and
indict
you
to
the
possession
with
intent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
position.
okay.
thank
you...
thank
you.
