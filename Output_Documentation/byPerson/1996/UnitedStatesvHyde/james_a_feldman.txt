mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
respondent's
attempt
to
withdraw
from
his
guilty
plea.
pursuant
to
a
plea
agreement
in
which
the
government
agreed
to
drop
certain
charges
against
him,
respondent
plead
guilty...
pleaded
guilty
to
mail
fraud
and
the
receipt
of
stolen
property
in
four
counts.
when...
at
the
rule
11
plea
proceeding,
the
district
court
ascertained
that
respondent
knew
the
nature
of
the
charges
that
were
brought
against
him,
that
he
knew
of
the
rights
that
he
would
be
waiving
by
pleading
guilty,
that
he
knew
the
maximum
sentence
that
he
could
face,
that
the
court
also
ascertained
that
his
guilty
plea
was
entirely
voluntary
and
uncoerced,
and
the
court
ascertained
the
facts
of
the
crime
as
narrated
both
by
respondent
and
as
narrated
by
the
prosecutor,
and
then
he
found
out...
he
ascertained
that
the
respondent
agreed
with
the
prosecutor's
account.
the
court
stated
at
that
point,
after
having
gone
through
that
proceeding,
that
it
would...
that
it
accepted
the
guilty
plea
and
that
it
would
defer
the
decision
about
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
plea
agreement.
one
month
later,
respondent
attempted
to
withdraw
from
his
guilty
plea.
the
court,
the
district
court
refused,
finding
that
respondent
had
advanced
no
fair
and
just
reason
for
doing
so.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
decision,
holding
that
the
respondent
could
withdraw
from
his
guilty
plea
at
will
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason,
as
the
court
stated,
and
reversed
the
district
court.
now,
our
position
is
that
respondent
could
withdraw
from
his
guilty
plea
only
if
he
had
a
fair
and
just
reason
for
doing
so
under
rule
32(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
because
he
had
no
fair
and
just
reason
in
this
case,
the
district
court
properly
declined
to
permit
him
to
withdraw.
permitting
the
withdrawal
of
an
accepted
guilty
plea
at
the
free
option
of
the
defendant
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
rule
32(e)
provides
that
before
sentence
a
district
court
may
permit
a
defendant
to
withdraw
from
a
guilty
plea
if
he
shows
a
fair
and
just
reason.
now,
the
courts...
courts
that
in...
the
courts
that
have
to
determine
whether
to
accept
a
plea
agreement
ordinarily
will
do
just
what
the
district
court
did
here,
which
is
postpone
a
decision
on
the
plea
agreement
until
at
or
near
the
time
of
sentencing,
when
they've
had
a
chance
to
review
the
presentence
report.
under
the...
and
accept
the
guilty
plea
at
the
time
of
the
rule
11
hearing.
under
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
in
this
case,
the
rule
32(e)
standard,
the
fair
and
just
reason
standard,
would
have
virtually
no
application
at
all.
it
would
apply
only
for
the
minutes
or
hours
or
maybe
days
from
the
time
that
the
district
court
has
reviewed
the
presentence
report
and
can
make
a
decision
about
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
plea
agreement
and
the
time
of
sentencing,
which
is
really
no
time
at
all.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
your
honor,
i
haven't
been
able
to
get...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
they
are
always
separate
in
cases...
virtually
always
separate
in
cases
where
a
district
court
has
to
make
a
decision
on
a
plea
agreement,
which
is
not
in
all
guilty
plea
cases
but
is
in
a
great
many
of
them.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
as
i
said,
i
think
it's
in
every
case
in
which
the
government
agrees
to
drop
certain
charges
in
response
for
the
defendant's...
in
exchange
for
the
defendant's
guilty
plea,
and
when
you
have
that
kind
of
a
plea
agreement,
under
the
sentencing
guideline...
under
the
federal
rules
of
procedure
the
district
court
is
permitted
to
defer
a
decision
on
whether
to
accept
that
plea
agreement,
and
under
the
guidelines
it
says
that
the
district
court
is
required
to
do
so.
in
virtually
all
of
those
cases,
and
i'll
tell
you
in
a
minute
why
i
say
virtually...
in
virtually
all
of
those
cases
the
district
court
will
do
just
what
the
district
court
did
here,
which
is
accept
the
guilty
plea
in
accordance
with
the
rules
for
accepting
a
guilty
plea
in
rule
11,
and
defer
a
decision
on
a
plea
agreement.
the
only
reason
i
say
virtually
all
and
not
all
is,
there
are
two
circumstances
under
which
that
won't
happen
in
those
charge-bargaining
types
of
cases.
one
circumstance
is
where
the
district
court
defers
decision
on
whether
to
accept
the
plea
itself.
this
is
a
very
rare
occurrence,
but
we
cited
a
couple
of
cases
in
our
brief
where
it
happened.
the
district
court
sees
the...
listens
to
the
guilty
plea,
thinks
there
may
be
something
wrong...
i'm
not
sure...
it
doesn't
really
explain
why
the
district
court
chose
to
do
that,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
rules
of
procedure
that
requires
a
district
court
to
accept
a
guilty
plea
at
the
time
it's
tendered,
and
so
if
the
guilty...
if
the
court
defers
decision
on
whether
to
accept
it,
then
everything
may
happen
at
once,
usually
at
around
the
time
of
sentencing,
both
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
and
of
the
plea
agreement.
the
other
category
of
cases,
which
is
also
rare
but
not
quite
as
rare
as
those,
is
cases
where
for
some
reason
there
was
a
preplea
presentence
report
prepared.
in
those
case
the
district
court
already
has
the
presentence
report
at
the
time
the
plea
is...
the
plea
colloquy
occurs
under
rule
11
and
therefore
once
again
the
district
court
can
take
care
of
everything
at
once,
and
there's
no
period
of
time
during...
between
the
time
of
accepting
the
plea
and
a
decision
on
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
plea
agreement.
but
aside
from
those
cases,
this
procedure
that
happened
here
i
think
is
exactly
by
the
book.
it's
exactly
what's
envisioned
by
the
rules
of
procedure,
and
it
will
happen
in
the
majority
of
guilty
plea
cases.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
the
judge
must
at
that
point,
under
rule...
i
think
11(e)(4),
i
believe.
the
rule...
once
the
judge
rejects
the
plea
agreement,
at
that
point
what...
the
goal
is
to
put
the
parties
in
the
same
position
they
would
have
been
in
if
nothing
had
happened,
if
none
of
this
had
happened,
because
the
agreement
can't
be
carried
out.
a
condition
subsequent
to
the
agreement
is...
has
now
failed.
and
so
what
you
would
do
is
the
same
thing
as
you
would
do
in
ordinary
contract
cases
when
that
kind
of
situation
occurs.
you
give
the
defendant
the
option
of
withdrawing
his
guilty
plea,
and
the
government,
of
course,
at
that
point
is
no
longer
bound
to
carry
out
any
commitments
it
has
under
the
plea
agreement,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
that's...
that
was
what...
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
held
that
the
defendant
was
permitted
to
withdraw
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason.
the
district
court
held
that
the
reasons
that
were
advanced
by
the
respondent
were
not
fair
and
just
reasons,
and
that
hasn't
been
challenged
in
this
court,
so
i
think
that
we
definitely...
the
case
definitely
comes
before
the
court
in
that
posture.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
mean,
that
actually
will
happen
also
in
any
case
in
which
he
rejects
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
mean,
that's
contemplated
by
the
rules
that
that's
going
to
happen.
if
it
looks
as
if
there's
likely
to
be
some
prejudice
that
might
result
from
that,
the
judge
could...
can
recuse
himself
if
the
case
ends
up
going
to
trial.
in
fact,
it
is
rare
that
judges
reject
the
agreements.
usually
those
are
the
agreements
of
the
parties.
they're
subject
to
a
number
of
constraints
and
just
don't
ordinarily
reject
them,
but
that
is
something
that
could
happen,
and
that
would
have
to
be
taken
care
of
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
would
agree,
and
actually
i
think
respondent
in
his
brief
agrees
that
the
government
would
be
free
to
withdraw
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
we
also--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--our
position
is
that
neither
party
is
free
to
withdraw--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
there's
any
thing
in
the
rules...
there
certainly
is
nothing
in
the
rules
that
addresses
the
government's
attempt
to
with--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it's
really
just
based
on
the
contract
analogy
of
plea-bargaining
that
the
court
has
referred
to
a
number
of
times
and
the
rule
in
santabello
that
the
government
does
have
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct,
but
generally
the
government
does
have
to
fulfill
the
undertakings
that
it
assumes
in
connection
with
a
plea
agreement.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
yes,
and
i
think
in
fact
even
aside
from
whether
there's
detriment
or
not
there's
been
an
exchange
of
promises
on
both
sides,
and
i
think
it's
just
as
binding
on
both
sides
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
generally
the
government's...
i
tell
you,
things
work
out...
i
think
things
work
out
a
little
bit
differently.
that's
a
possible
position,
and
of
course
that's
not
raised
by
this
case
and
the
government
rarely
does
attempt
to
withdraw
from
plea
agreements,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
government
may
be
able
to
withdraw
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
a
better
way
to
look
at
that
kind
of
a
case,
though,
is
where
there's
been
a
charge-bargain
plea
agreement
the
district
court,
at
the
time
when
it's
called
upon
to
accept
the
agreement
or
not,
is
supposed
to
look
and
see
whether
the
charges
that
remain
are
commensurate
with
what
the
defendant
did,
whether
this
agreement
is
in
the
public
interest.
so
a
better
way
to
look
at
i
think
what
happens
in
those
kinds
of
cases
would
be
that
the
district
court
would
reject
the
plea
agreement
and,
indeed,
the
government
might
point
out
to
the
district
court
reasons
why
it
should
reject
the
plea
agreement,
but
if
the
district
court
doesn't...
and
it's
really
up
to
the
district
court.
if
the
district
court
disagrees
and
says,
you
know,
this
seems
like
a
perfectly...
there's
nothing
that
contravenes
public
policy,
or
the
interests
of
the
public,
or
the
application
of
the
guidelines
in
this
plea
agreement,
then
the
district
court
will
hold
both
parties
to
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
what
the
government
is...
i
think
the
government
has
always
an
obligation
to
the
court
to
be
frank,
and
to
bring
to
the
court
any
facts
that
may
have
come
to
its
attention
that
maybe
it
didn't
even
know
before.
now,
plea
agreements
come
in
many
different
shapes,
and
some
of
them
do
limit
the
kinds
of
things...
the
government
makes
commitments
about
the
kinds
of
things
it
will
say
to
the
district
court.
it
won't
oppose
a
certain
sentence,
or
it
won't
comment
on
this
or
that,
and
whether
the
government's
comments
at
that
point
might
be
a
breach
of
the
agreement
is
really
another
question.
it
depends
on
what
the
agreement
says.
there
may
be
an
agreement
where
it's
not
at
all,
where
the
government
says,
we
will
bring
to
the
court,
and
we're
not
committing
ourselves
to
telling
the
court
anything
in
particular.
but
in
any
event,
whatever
the
government
agreed
to
i
think
it
always
has
an
obligation
to
the
court
to
inform
it
of
the
relevant
facts
that
the
court
should
know
in
order
to
pass
its
judgment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it
contemplates--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the...
actually,
the
one--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
guess
ordinarily
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--dismissal
of
the
indict...
of
the
charges
doesn't
occur
until
after
sentencing.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
so
ordinarily
the
charges
are
still
there
at
the
time
the
judge
may
reject
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
cordova
is...
i
don't
think
cordova
is
wrong.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
cordova's
reasoning,
i
think,
is
wrong,
but
the
result--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
exactly
our
position.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
not
to
indict,
but
to
continue
to
trial
on
the
charges
that
were
already--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--under
which
you're
already
indicated.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
our
position
is
the
government
under...
the
court
under
appropriate
circumstances
i
think
could
order
specific
performance
of
that
promise.
it
would
really
depend--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
the
authority
i
would
have
is
just
the
cases
where
some
problem
has
arisen
after
a
plea
bargain
where
the
government
has
breached
a
plea
agreement,
and
where
the
government
does
that,
generally...
in
fact,
i
think
this
was
true
in
santabello
itself,
but
it's
also
been
true
in
the
way
the
courts
of
appeals
have
dealt
with
federal
cases,
that
the
case
goes
back
for
a
determination
of
what
the
appropriate
remedy
might
be.
it
might
be
permitting
the
defendant
to
withdraw
from
his
end
of
the
bargain,
and
withdraw
the
plea.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
or--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
true
the
rules
don't
address
it,
and
i
think
you
fill
in
the
background
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--not
yet,
and
i
really
don't
know...
actually
that
was
going
to
happen
this
month.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
he
was
supposed
to
report
back
this
month.
i
don't
know--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
honestly
am
not
aware
of
what's
actually
become
of
that.
it's
possible
that
after
this
court
granted
cert
that...
whether
he
continued
to
work
on
that
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
it's
our
position--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
know,
but
i'd
like
to
say
i
may
be
mentioning
a
number
of
things
that
aren't
in
the
rules,
because
you
do
use
contract,
the
law
of
contract
to
kind
of
fill
in
the
gaps
in
plea
bargaining.
but
the
basic
result
in
this
case,
i
think,
is
determined
by
the
rules,
because
if
i
said
under
the
ninth
circuit's
rule...
first
of
all
under
rule
32(e)
the
fair
and
just
reason
business
would
have
been
really
entirely
illusory.
it
would
apply
for
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes.
and
it's
obvious
if
you
look
at
that
rule
itself
and
the
purposes
behind
it
and
what
the
advisory
committee
said
when
it
added
that
in
1983,
that
was
a
rule...
that
was
an
important
step.
it
was
intended
to
bolster
the
respect
and
the
dignity
of
plea
proceedings.
plea
proceedings
are
governed
by
rule
11,
which
has
in
(a),
(b),
(c),
and
(d)
of
that
rule
has
extensive
provisions
about
exactly
how
a
plea
has
to
be
taken,
all
the
steps
the
judge
has
to
take,
which,
in
fact,
the
judge
took
here,
and
that
once
the
defendant
has
gone
through
all
of
that,
nobody
should
have
the
illusion
that
they're
just
free
to
walk
away
from
it
with
no
consequences
at
all,
especially
if
they
don't
have
a
fair
and
just
reason
to
do
so.
it's
also
our
position
that
rule
11
itself
dictates
this
result
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
rule
11
in
(a),
(b),
(c),
and
(d),
talks
about
the
plea
and
about
accepting
the
plea.
it
doesn't,
i
don't
think,
mention
the
plea
agreement,
or
if
it
does
it
talks
about
plea
agreements.
it's
quite
clear
it's
talking
about
pleas.
it
gets
to
(e),
which
is
entitled
plea
agreement
procedure,
and
(e)
was
the
provision
that
was
added
to
deal
with
plea
agreements,
and
the
rule
makes
perfect
sense
and
is
perfectly
consistent
in
its
very
precise
differentiation
between
those
provisions
that
have
to
do
with
acceptance
of
a
guilty
plea,
which
has
to
do
with
the
defendant's
confession
in
open
court
as
to
what
he
did,
and
those
provisions
that
have
to
do
with
the
plea
agreement,
which
is
an
entirely
different
question,
which
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
bargain
and
is
treated
in
the
(e)
provision.
and
indeed,
in
rule
11(e)(4),
the
provision
that
we...
that
was
mentioned
earlier,
where
it
says
that
the
court...
that
if
the
court
rejects
the
plea
agreement
the
defendant
shall
be
permitted
to
withdraw
his
plea,
the
whole
notion
there
that
the
defendant
can
withdraw
the
plea
i
think
has
as
its
underlying
assumption
that
there's
been
a
valid,
binding
plea
entered
at
that
point,
and
there
has
been.
so
i
think
the
result
that
we're
urging
here
is
dictated
by
the
federal
rules.
i
also
think
the
result
we're
urging
here
is
dictated
by
the
law
of
contracts.
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
straightforward
situation
of
a
contract
involving
an
exchange
of
a
performance
by
the
defendant
for
a
promise
by
the
government
to
do
something
later,
subject
to
a
later
condition,
and
everybody's
bound
to
that
unless
the
condition...
once
the
plea
is
accepted...
once
the
plea
is
accepted
by
the
district
court,
unless
the
later
condition
doesn't
occur.
i
think
that
if
there...
under
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
there
would
be
a
great
deal
of
instability
ejected
into
the
plea-bargaining
process.
a
defendant
at
any
time
during
the
several
months
that
it
takes
to
prepare
the
presentence
report
can
just
say,
i
changed
my
mind.
i
don't
want
to
go
ahead
and
do
this.
at
that
point,
everything
stops.
well,
that
is
a
process
that's
at
the
unilateral
whim
of
the
defendant
that's
open
to
manipulation.
it's
open
to
a
defendant
who
wants
to
obtain
severance
from
codefendants
to
plead
guilty
and
then
just
change
his
mind
later.
it's
open
to
the
possibility
that
a
defendant
who's
just
trying
to
delay
an
inevitable
imprisonment
could
do
that.
it's
even
open
to
a
defendant
who
sees
that
the
government...
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
guilty
plea
was
taken
at
the
morning
of
trial,
which
is
not
at
all
uncommon.
once...
you
see
that
the
government
has
assembled
all
of
its
witnesses
once.
a
couple
of
months
later
there
may
be
some
witnesses
who
are
unavailable.
there
may
be
witnesses
who
are
no
longer
in
the
jurisdiction,
or
even,
in
a
sufficiently
extreme
case,
a
defendant
might
take
steps
to
see
to
it
that
those
things
happen.
all
of
those
things
can
happen
if
you
give
the
defendant
this
free
window
of
several
months
after
the
plea
to
just
change
his
mind,
and
i
think
if
the
advisory
committee
had
proposed
that
kind
of
a
rule,
i
think
it
clearly
would
have
been
rejected
because
of
the
instability
it
lends
to
the
process.
another
consequence
it
can
have
is
that
the
preparation
of
the
presentence
report
itself
ordinarily
requires
the
cooperation
of
both
the
defendant
and
the
government.
now,
presumably
if
both
parties
are
free
to
just
withdraw
at
whim
during
this
period
between
the
guilty
plea
proceedings
and
the...
basically
and
sentencing,
it
would
be...
it's
very
hard
for
the
parties
to
lend
the
kind
of
cooperation
to
the
probation
officer
that
they
would
have
to
do,
since
neither
is
sure
that
the
information
that
they're
providing
wouldn't
ultimately
be...
they're
now
revealing
it
to
a
party
who
could
easily,
at
that
party's
own
whim,
become
the
opposing
party
at
a
trial,
and
i
think
it
would
make
preparation
of
those
reports
very
difficult.
and
again,
in
this
case,
in
fact,
the
preparation
of
the
presentence
report
was
delayed
while
all
of
this...
proceedings
were
going
on
in
the
district
court,
because
respondent
wasn't
cooperating
with
the
probation
officer
during
that
period.
finally,
i
think
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
and
respect
that
judicial
proceedings
should
have
that
a
formal
rule
11
proceeding
in
open
court
should
have...
should
basically
be
able
to
be
rendered
a
nullity
by
the
defendant's
unilateral
action.
a
defendant...
if
you
read...
i
think
it's
worth
looking
at
the
plea
proceeding
here,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
was
all
gone
through
very
carefully
with
the
defendant.
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
he
knew
the
nature
of
the
charges
and
the
possible
sentence,
and
all...
he
shouldn't
be
able
to
walk
out
of
the
courtroom
and
then
say,
well,
i
haven't
decided
yet
whether
i'm
going
to
plead
guilty.
it's
true
i
just,
under
oath,
told
the
court
about
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
confessed,
i
went
through
all
this,
but
i
may
change
my
mind
and
i'll
make
up
my
mind
in
a
couple
of
months.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
in
the
90-percent
range.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
in
that
range.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
just
had
one
point
i
wanted
to
make.
for
purposes
of
this
case...
this
is
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question...
we
have
accepted
that
it's
the...
that
at
least
at
the
latest
time
when
the
district
court
accepts
the
plea
the
parties
are
bound.
now,
whether
at
some
earlier
point
the
parties
may
be
bound
or
not
is
really
not
something
that
arises
here,
because
it
was
done
so
carefully
in
this
case,
and
that...
we've
said
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
guess...
it's
hard
for
me
to
answer,
because
i
do
think
there
are
several
of
them,
but
i
think
32(e)
would
be
rendered
a
nullity
in
a...
most
cases
if
the
ninth
circuit's
view
were
right,
and
i
don't
think
that
rendering...
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
strongest
one
in
my
view.
i
also
think
there
are
provisions
of
rule
11,
as
i
mentioned
before,
that
clearly
distinguish
between
pleas
and
plea
agreements.
