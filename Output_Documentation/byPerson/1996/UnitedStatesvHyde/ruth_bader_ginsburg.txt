justice
ruth
bader

will
they,
mr.
feldman?
the
rules
advisory
committee
in
october
instructed
the
reporter
to
propose
amendments
to
rule
11
in
response
to
this
very
case
and
another
one.
has
there
been
any
proposal,
proposed
revision
of
rule
11?
justice

bader

it
was
supposed
to
happen
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
think
it
was
earlier
in
this...
i
think
it
was
around
april
8
the
reporter
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
don't
know
whether
any
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--questions
that
the
chief
has
raised
have
been
addressed
in
the
proposed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
soglin,
if
you
look
at
the...
or...
you've
witnessed
rule
11
pleas,
and
it
was
with
all
due
solemnity,
and
the
district
judge
is
telling
the
defendant
all
of
his
rights,
and
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
now,
one
wouldn't
perceive
of
that
procedure
in
court
as
something
that's
tentative,
so
there's
something
that
doesn't
quite
fit,
and
the
rules
are
meticulous
in
instructing
the
judge
about
advising
the
defendant
of
his
rights,
and
anyone
who
comes
into
a
courtroom
and
sees
that
that's
how
we
do
justice
in
the
united
states,
and...
but
then
you
say
that
this
is
just
an
ephemeral
thing,
that
it's
not
real,
that
when
the
judge
says
now,
knowing
all
that,
do
you
plead
guilty,
and
the
defendant
says
yes,
and
the
judge
says
i
accept
it,
that
all
that
is
kind
of
make-believe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
no
agreement
at
that
point
that
the
judge...
the
judge
hasn't
been
presented
with
the
agreement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
hasn't
accepted
it,
because
he's
waiting
for
the
presentence
report.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
soglin,
you
mentioned
a
law
review
commentary
about
what
is
being
done,
and
whether
you
need
a
presentence
report.
do
you
know...
i'm
asking
you
the
question
i
asked
mr.
feldman...
since
the
rules
advisory
committee
were
alerted
to
the
problem
by
the
very
case
that
we're
reviewing,
and
were
going
to
take
a
look
at
rule
11
to
see
if
they
should
make
some
proposed
alterations,
do
you
know
what
kinds
of
alterations,
or
do
you
know
anything
more
than
mr.
feldman
did
about
where
that
sits?
