chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-667,
united
states
v.
hyde.
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy
is
unable
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument.
he
will,
however,
hear
the
tapes
of
oral
argument
and
participate
in
the
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
shouldn't
the
government
be
free
to
withdraw
if
there's
nothing
in
the
rules
that
addresses
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
santabello
wasn't
a
federal
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
happens,
mr.
feldman,
if
the
government
decides
under
a
type
(a)
move
for
dismissal
of
other
charges
that
it
no
longer
wants
to
go
through
with
that?
the
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty
but
the
trial
court
hasn't
accepted
the
plea,
and
so
it
simply
either
refuses
to
dismiss
or
recharges.
what
can
the
court
do
about
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
do
you
have
any
judicial
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
that
would
presumably
be
a
just
reason
under
the
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
arguing
for
so
much
here
that
the
rules
simply
don't
address.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
soglin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
how
would
you
reason
through
the
result
you
want,
that
if
the
defendant
is
not
bound
by
the
plea,
as
you
say,
that
the
government
nonetheless
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
unless
you
say
that
since
it
says...
the
rule
says
nothing
about
the
government
being
bound,
that
perhaps
the
government
should
be
able
to
withdraw
regardless
of
a
just
reason.
the
rules
simply
don't
address
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
those
aren't
rules,
are
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
deny
him
government
employment,
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
but
that's
not
a
possible
disposition.
i
mean
we
can
affirm
or
we
will
reverse.
we
can't
say
the
sentencing
commission
should
take
another
look.
we
have
to
decide
this
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
soglin.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
