justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
however
the
state
speaks,
whether
it
speaks
through
the
legislature
or
it
speaks
through
the
supreme
court,
there
is
an
agency
of
the
state
which
is
capable
of
valuing
the
state's
interest
here,
and
if
it
believes
that
the
state's
interest
really
does
require
the
appealability
of
a
qualified
immunity
ruling,
there's
some
agency
of
a
state
that
can
say,
that's
the
regime
we
will
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
ultimately
the
responsibility
for
the
nonappealability
is
with
the
state
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
now,
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
the
justification
for
immediate
appealability
is
a
justification
which
rests
ultimately
not
on
individual
interests
but
on
state
interests,
and
therefore,
if
the
state
doesn't
want
to
take
advantage
of
it,
why,
indeed,
should
a
federal
court
interfere
with
that
decision?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gilmore,
you
have
repeatedly
characterized
the
right
which
is
at
stake
here
as
being
a
personal
right
of
united
states
citizens.
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
is
this.
as
i
understand
our
analysis
of
qualified
immunity
up
to
this
point,
it
is
an
analysis
which
has
recognized
the
immunity
number
1,
because
it
was
thought
to
be
recognized
at
common
law
when
1983
went
in,
and
that
common
law
background
is
supposedly
the
basis
for
our
interpretation.
but
number
2,
because
the
interest
which
that
immunity
protects
is
the
public
or
state
interest
against
having
its
officers
made
timid
or
distracted,
and
so
on.
my
understanding
is
we
have
never
recognized
the
interest
as
being
a
separate,
individual
interest.
the
individuals
get
the
benefit
because
that's
the
necessary
implication
of
the
state
getting
the
benefit.
am
i
right
in
my
understanding?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was...
i
mean,
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
i
really
don't
see
how
you
can
say,
well,
those
were
plaintiffs
and
these
are
defendants.
so
what?
i
mean,
the...
if
that's
all
it
is,
if
they're
plaintiffs
and
here's
the
defendants,
when
i
read
felder...
but
you're
going
to
agree
with
what
i
say
is
the
problem,
and
you'd
better
not
agree
with
it
because
it
will
turn
out
it's
wrong.
i
want
to
know
why...
i
mean,
when
i
read
felder,
i
thought
that
felder
follows
from
rose,
because
rose
is
a
case
that
says
you
can't
just
kick
a
1983
actions
out
of
your
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
felder
was
a
case
where
they
said
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
he's
hurt
within
120
days,
and
they
say
that's
such
a
short
time,
120
days
to
notify
that
you're
hurt,
that
it's
about
the
same
thing,
kicking
it
out.
all
right.
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
correct
distinction
or
not,
but
if
you're
just
going
to
distinguish...
unless
you
find
something
like...
i
mean,
can
you
say
a
little
more
about
well,
we're
plaintiffs
and
they're
defendants?
i
mean,
that,
to
me,
doesn't
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
true
if
everybody
knew
that
the
state
was
going
to
pay
the
judgment.
suppose
the
individual's
going
to
pay
the
judgment?
can
the
federal
government
not
condition
the
terms
on
which
a
person
is
liable
for
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
under
a
federal
statute
and
say
we're
not
going
to
make
you
liable
if
the
law
was
not
clear?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
sure
that's
true
if
it's
a
state...
if
it's
a
state
liability
scheme,
but
this
is
a
federal
liability
scheme.
the
federal
government
has
said
you
as
a
person
are
individually
liable
for
violating
1983,
but
we'll
give
you
a
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
suppose
the
state
doesn't
indemnify
the
persons,
or
the
state
treasury
is
insufficient?
i
don't
think
the
state
can
abolish
a
federal
defense
that
this
court
and
the
congress
by
inference
have
granted
to
a
defendant,
an
individual
defendant.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
determines
the
outcome
of
whether
they
have
to
stand
trial
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
that
respect
there
is
a
determination--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
the
bell
cannot
be
unrung.
