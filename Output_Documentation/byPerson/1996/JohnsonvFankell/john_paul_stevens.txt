justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
hypothetical
question?
do
you
think
the
state
could
pass
a
statute
that
was
patterned
after
1983
and
said,
state
court
shall
entertain
claims
for
violations
of
federal
constitutional
rights
and
everything
else
the
same
as
in
1983,
and
add
to
it,
and
the
state...
and
the
defendant
shall
not
be
allowed
to
plead
qualified
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
procedure
that's
followed
doesn't
reach
the
question
whether
you
will
ultimately
prevail
on
the
immunity
issue.
if
you
do
have
the
immunity,
you
will
ultimately
win
the
lawsuit,
but
you
will
have
the
burden
of
a
trial
that
you
will
otherwise
avoid,
a
burden
that
is
a
burden
on
the
state
judicial
system
as
well
as
on
the
parties
to
the
case,
and
the
top
officers
of
the
state
judicial
system
say
we're
willing
to
pay
that
price
in
order
to
save
the
appellate
courts
the
premature
adjudication
burden.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
certainly
don't
have
to
take
that
position
to
defend
this
case,
because
there's
a
vast
difference
between
giving
up
a
procedural
right
that
does
not
affect
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case
and
giving
up
a
defense
that
would
change
the
outcome
in
many,
many
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
felder,
of
course,
part
of
the
analysis
was
that
the
statute
affected
the
outcome
in
a
significant
number
of
cases,
and
that's
not
true
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
one
respect
it
does
go
away,
because
the
one
element
of
the
immunity
defense
is
the
element
not
to
have
to
stand
trial,
and
that
does
go
away.
if
the
only
time
you
can
raise
qualified
immunity
is
after
trial,
then
you
have
lost
that
element
of
the
immunity,
and
that...
to
that
degree
it
is
outcome-determinative.
