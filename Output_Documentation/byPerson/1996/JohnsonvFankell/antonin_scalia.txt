justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
that
the
qualified
immunity
federal
rule
did
not
just
apply
to
federal
officers
but
also
applied
to
state
officers.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
there
is
some
federal
interest,
or
at
least
when
we
discerned
that
rule
we
thought
that
was,
or
when
congress
enacted
the
statutes
relying
on
prior
historical
practice
congress
thought
there
was
a
federal
interest
in
allowing
state
officers
to
have
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do
give
state
officers
immunity
in
federal
courts,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gilmore,
here's
what
troubles
me.
we
do
have
language
in
our
opinions
to
say
that
the
immunity
right
is
a
right
not
to
be
tried,
not
just
a
right
to
be
acquitted,
or
found
innocent.
however,
we
said
that
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
the
policy
expressed
in
1983
was
sufficient
to
overcome
what
would
be
the
normal
operation
of
a
federal
statute.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
the
same
question
whether
that
policy
is
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
state's
ability
to
manage
procedures
in
its
own
courts.
don't
you
think
they're
really
two
different
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
this
is
an
optional
thing
with
the
state,
then
i
suppose
the
state
could
decide
not
to
accept
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
at
all,
if
it
thinks
its
officers
don't
need
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose--
--if
a
1983
action
were
brought,
the
defendant
would...
i
mean,
he
could
tell
the
attorney
general
not
to,
but
he
couldn't
tell
the
individual
who's
being
sued
for
his
private
fortune
not
to
assert
a
defense
that
he
has.
you
think
the
state
could
do
that,
say
you
offered
us
this.
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
state,
and
we
don't
think
we
need
it
so
we're
not
going
to
let
our
state
officers
do
it.
you
don't
think
they
could
do
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
the
executive.
i'm
talking
about
the
state
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
state
courts?
the
state
courts
could
say,
the
federal
government's
been
very
kind
to
offer
us
this
immunity
defense,
but
speaking
for
the
state,
thanks
but
no
thanks,
and
you're
liable
under
1983
without
any
immunity?
that's
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
mean...
they
go
together,
it
seems
to
me.
if
you...
you're
asserting
a
doctrine
of
waiver,
i
guess,
or...
i
don't
know,
declination
of
offer,
and
you
say
that
the
federal
government
has
essentially
offered
the
state
the
advantage
to
its
officers
of
having
an
immediate
interlocutory
appeal,
and
the
state
is
saying
we
don't
think
we
need
it.
well,
if
they
could
do
it
for
that
element
of
qualified
immunity,
why
can't
they
do
it
for
the
whole
doctrine
and
just
say,
we
will
not
allow
that
as
a
defense
to
a
1983
suit.
i
think
your
position
is,
yes,
they
can
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
really
doesn't
deny
the
right
not
to
stand
trial,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
person
has
that
right
not
to
stand
trial.
the
only
issue
is,
when
the
district
judge
makes
a
mistake
in
the
course
of
adjudication
and
finds
that
right
not
to
be
applicable,
what
is
the
procedural
remedy?
you
don't
have
to
concede
that
the
right
not
to
stand
trial
has
been
abrogated
by
the
state,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
latta,
do
you
think
your
case
might
be
weaker
if
cohen
hadn't
decided
that
there
are
exceptions
which
this
court
can
carve
out
to
the
final
decision
rule?
in
other
words,
suppose
the
federal
statute
were
categorical
and
this
court
had
said,
well,
yes,
the
procedural
statute
is
categorical,
but
it
seems
to
come
into
conflict
with
the
right
set
forth
in
1983,
and
since
it
comes
into
conflict
with
it,
we
think
the
rights
set
forth
in
1983
must
prevail,
and
despite
a
final
judgment
absolute
rule,
we
think
that
statute
prevails.
if
it
would
prevail
over
the
federal
statute,
wouldn't
it
prevail
over
the
state
statute
as
well,
if
it
were
that
strong
a
federal
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
another--
--it's
moving
at
a
slower
rate,
though.
yes,
i
think
we're
not
leaking
quite
as
much
as
we
used
to.
i
suppose
another
way
of
phrasing
justice
scalia's
question
is
whether
the
appealability
rule
adopted
in
mitchell
is
a
construction
of
1291
or
a
construction
of
1983,
and
i
suppose
the
answer's
obvious
because
mitchell
wasn't
even
a
1983
case.
