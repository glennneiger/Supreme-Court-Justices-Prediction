justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
interest
stronger
than
that?
isn't
the
interest
that
the
citizen
is
liable
for
a
judgment
under
1983
under
a
federal
statute,
and
that
is
a
federal
immunity
that
appertains
to
that
person
as
an
individual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
part
of
the
contours
of
the
1983
right.
the
liability
of
the
officer
personally
does
not
extend
so
far
as
to
avoid
an
immunity
that
the
federal
government
grants.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
that
subject,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
prevail
here,
states
must
give
abney
appeals
in
all
double
jeopardy
cases.
do
the
states
generally
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
does
follow
from
your
position
here,
i
suppose,
that
abney
appeals
would
be
mandated
on
the
states
in
all
double
jeopardy
cases
if
you
prevail
here.
it
would
seem
to
me
a
parallel
principle,
perhaps
a
principle
of
even
more
importance,
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
the
trial
court
have
to
give
its
permission
to
have
the
ruling
appealed
under
that
discretionary
regime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
trying
to
ascertain
what
role
does
the
trial
judge
have
in
establishing
whether
or
not
there
may
be
a
permissive
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
he
says
that
it
should
not,
then
that
ends
the
matter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose,
then,
if
we
were
to
say
that
this
is
a
substantive,
very
significant
right,
the
right
to
have
an
interlocutory
ruling,
then
it
would
be
then
an
abuse
of
discretion
of
idaho
law
not
to
take
the
appeal,
and
so
at
least
the
right
could
be
enforced
under
the
existing
procedural
structure
in
idaho.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
focusing
on
the
idaho
court
based
on
your
comments
to
justice
ginsburg
i
assume
no
one
could
tell
the
idaho
court
that
it
has
to
take...
has
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
take
the
appeal.
let's
assume
that
we
think
that
it's
very,
very
important
that
there
be
an
interlocutory
appeal.
i
was
asking
whether
or
not
that
could
be
accommodated
within
the
existing
idaho
structure,
and
suggested
that
maybe
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
idaho
supreme
court
not
to
take
the
appeal,
and
then
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
well,
the
whole
point
of
this
is
so
they
can
have
complete
control
over
their
docket.
they're
not
answerable
to
anybody.
and
so
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
then
a
problem
if
we
agree
with
the
petitioner's
case
that
this
is
such
a
significant
right
that
it
has
to
be
enforced
in
the
state
courts.
