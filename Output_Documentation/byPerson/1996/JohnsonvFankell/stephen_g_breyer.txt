justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
your
answer
to
justice
souter?
i
mean,
i
take
it
quite
specifically,
why
are
the
states
filing
amicus
briefs?
it's
up
to
the
states.
i
mean,
there's
no
federal
interest
here.
if
the
state
wants
to
subject
its
people
to
good
procedural
advantage,
they
can.
if
they
don't,
they
don't.
the
federal
government
doesn't
care,
so
what's
the
answer
to
that?
that's
what
i
take
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
it
as
a
matter
of...
no,
i
take
it
the
federal
law
is
that
1983,
in
giving
liability,
imposing
liability,
in
helping
plaintiffs
attain
certain
things,
doesn't
reach
as
far
as
the
area
where
what
the
state
person
did
was
lawful
or
uncertain.
it
only
reaches
the
area
where
what
the
state
officer
did
was
clearly
illegal.
now,
that's
what
this
court
has
held
often.
qualified
immunity
in
fact
arose
under
state
law,
and
congress
bought
into
it,
so
that's
the
federal
interest.
how
is
that
federal
interest
hurt
in
any
way
at
all
by
some
states
giving
these
people
some
procedural
advantage
and
others
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
so,
then
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
matter,
because...
well,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
right?
that
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--say
federal
statutes
allow
me
or
you
or
anybody
to
sue
certain
groups
of
people
under
myriad
circumstances,
and
in
each
of
those
statutes
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
ways
in
which
the
person
might
not
be
liable.
that's
because
the
statute
doesn't
cover
the
situation.
is
there
then
some
federal
interest
in
making
certain
that
the
procedures
that
are
used
to
decide
each
way
he's
not
liable
is
going
to
be
the
same
in
every
state,
the
federal
government?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
that's
the
problem
i
have.
once
i
see
the
case
that
way,
and
i
have...
obviously
have
been
seeing
it
that
way.
once
i
see
it
that
way,
i
find
it
difficult
to
articulate
the
federal
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
don't
they
have
influence
with
the
legislature
in
idaho?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you...
i
don't
want
to
interrupt.
are
you
finished?
i
want
you
to
finish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
what
was
wrong
in
felder
was
that
in
the
state
court,
by
imposing
the
time
requirement,
the
right
in
effect
was
shrunk
a
little
bit,
and
they
said
you
can't
shrink
these
rights
against
the
wishes
of
those
who
assert
them.
in
this
case,
the
party
that
is
protected
by
the
appealability
rule
in
a
qualified
immunity
case
is
the
state,
and
the
state
says
through
its
official
agencies,
i
don't
care.
it's
okay
with
me.
i
don't
want
that
right.
isn't
that
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
felder?
