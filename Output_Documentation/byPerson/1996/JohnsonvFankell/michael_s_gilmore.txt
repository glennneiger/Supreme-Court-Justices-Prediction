mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
the
court
is
presented
with
the
question
whether
the
qualified
immunity
defense
is
as
powerful
in
state
courts
as
it
is
in
federal
courts,
or
whether
its
scope
and
its
protection
may
vary
among
the
states,
or
between
federal
district
courts
and
one
state,
and
state
trial
courts
in
the
same
state.
thirty-six
states
are
involved
in
this,
between
the
amicus
and
the
petitioners,
because
of
the
importance
of
the
qualified
immunity
defense
to
the
practical
functioning
of
state
government,
and
because
of
the
value
of
this
defense
to
the
employees
and
officers
of
state
and
local
governments
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
that's
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer,
your
honor,
because
the
idaho
supreme
court
in
three
instances
had
ruled
that
its
court
rules
take
precedence
over
statutes
in
the
area
of
conflict
in
rules
of
procedure,
rules
of
evidence,
and
rules
regarding
a
special
statutory
court
that
was
established
to
adjudicate
water
rights
in
the
snake
river
basin.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
that
is
an
open
question.
it
has
not
addressed
that.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
simply
cannot
concede
that,
because
the
entire
recent
jurisprudence
in
idaho
has
been
for
the
state
supreme
court
to
say
its
rules
preempt
statutes
are
inconsistent.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
the
idaho
supreme
court
could
adopt
an
appellate
rule
that
would
explicitly
provide
for
appealability
of
denial
of
absolute
or
qualified
immunity
motions.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
it
is
with
one
of
the
branches
of
state
government.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
because
the
defendants
in
this
case,
or
the
petitioners
here,
are
sued
in
their
individual
capacities.
they
are
not
sued
as
state
officers,
as
such,
in
their
official
capacity.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
that
is
correct,
only
governmental
officers.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
it's
rule
12(a)
of
the
idaho
supreme
court,
and
the
idaho
supreme
court
decision
of
todd
v.
budell
states
that
that
was
modeled
upon
1292.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
the
answer
to
that
is,
the
state
officers
who
the
attorney
general
must
represent
want
to
assert
these
personal
defenses
that
you
have
held
as
a
matter
of
federal
law--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--in
a
literal
sense,
the
federal
interest
is
not
hurt.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
because...
because
all
of
these
officers
of
the
state
of
idaho
are
federal
citizens
and
have
citizens'
rights.
the
federal
government,
i
suppose,
could
be
indifferent
to
all
kinds
of...
all
kinds
of
violations
of
rights
or
immunities
of
federal
citizens
unless
it
enacts
a
law
to
take
care
of
them.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
it
applies
to
all
state,
local,
federal
government
officers.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
there's--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--yes.
there's
a
federal
interest
that's
been
described
in
both
the
bivens
cases
and
the
1983
cases,
preventing
unfounded
distraction
of
government
officers
and
disruption
of
effective
government.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
no.
as
i
understand
the
court's
precedent,
state
officers
can
only
claim
federal
immunities,
not
state
immunities.
for
example,
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--yes.
i
think
there
are
several
federal
interests.
one
is
that
there
be
identical
decisions
in
the
1983
case
between
the
federal
district
court
and
the
state
courts
in
the
same
state.
i
think
our
interest
in
1983
be
applied
uniformly
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
yes,
and
that's
the
interest--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--the
federal
government
has
an
interest
in
all
of
its
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--the
state
cannot
waive
its
federal
officers...
excuse
me.
the
state
cannot
waive
its
officers
or
employees'
rights
as
federal
citizens.
this
is
a
right
that
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
has
if
they
work
for
a
government.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
an
immunity.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
no.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
the
federal
interest
is
in
preservation
of
the
state
actors'
federal
immunities
created
under
federal
law,
and
the
prevention
of
a
loss
of
those
federal
immunities.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
think
the
state
would
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
pass
such
a
statute.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
if
federal
law
prohibited
appeal
from
qualified
immunity
motions
from
the
denial
of
qualified
immunity
motions
in
the
federal
courts,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
no,
i
do
not
believe
the
qualified
immunity
defense
has
been
characterized
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
am
not
an
expert
in
this
area
of
relations
between
federal
courts
and
the
federal
congress,
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
i
think
i
would
say
yes,
only
to
try
to
outline
the
contours
of
what
we're
looking
for.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
congress--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--when
i
did
my
research
in
that
area,
a
majority
of
the
states
that
i
was
able
to
identify
allowed
an
abney
appeal,
and
then
there
was
a
further
safety
valve.
three
of
the
circuits
in
cases
where
there
are
no...
in
which
there
are
states
located
that
have
not
allowed
abney
appeals,
have
found
an
exception
to
younger
abstention
and
have
handled
the
practical
difficulties
of
dealing
with
double
jeopardy
claims
in
the
state
courts
by
proceeding
to
enjoin
the
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
think
there
are
theoretical
parallels.
there
may
be
practical
differences
in
the
sense
that
i've
just
been
talking
about.
there
already
may
be
an
existing
safety
valve
that
the
circuits
have
created.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
kentucky
amicus,
that
is
something
the
court
must
weigh
in
the
balance,
but
i
would
hesitate
to
say
that
the
court
must
reach
that
issue
in
this
proceeding
i
think
because
of
the
practicalities
of
administration
of
abney,
in
particular,
modification
in
richardson
with
the
notion
of
a
colorable
double
jeopardy
claim.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
at
the
time
this
case
was
brought,
we
had
no
reason
to
believe
idaho
procedure
would
be
less
generous,
and
there
are
practical
reasons--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--no.
we
knew
that
the
language
of
idaho
appellate
rule
11(a)
was,
you
may
take
appeal
from
judgments,
orders,
or
decrees
which
are
final,
and
this
was
an
order,
and
this
court's
precedent
had
discussed
the
finality
of
denial
of
qualified
immunity
orders
many
times.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
idaho
has
never
addressed
beneficial,
to
adopt
or
reject
the
collateral
order
rule.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
one
cannot
always
get
in
the
federal
forum,
and
many
1983
cases
will
be
a
suit
against
a
number
of
officers,
perhaps
city,
county,
and
state,
and
without
concurrence
of
all
the
defendants,
there
is
no
right
of
removal.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
maybe
not
legal
interest,
but
practical
interest.
idaho's
a
big
state.
it
has
44
county
seats.
i
was
looking
at
a
map
yesterday.
one
of
them...
the
two
fish
and
game
officers
in
salmon,
idaho,
for
example,
were
sued
in
state
district
court
and
attempted
to
remove,
the
nearest
federal
district
courthouse
to
them
would
be
in
pocatello,
209
miles
away,
so
if
they
were
looking
at
trial,
they'd
be
looking
at
leaving
their
family
and
friends,
having
a
2-1/2
to
3-hour
drive
with
the
new
speed
limits
on
a
sunny,
clear
day,
and
5
or
6
hours
on
a
snowy
day
through
mountain
roads.
there
are
real
interests
in
keeping
things
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
but
i
think
to
elaborate
on
justice
ginsburg's
question,
the
answer
is
the
same
as
the
plaintiffs
in
felder.
they
could
have
filed
in
federal
district
court
if
they
didn't
want
to
worry
about
wisconsin's
notice
of
claim
statute,
but
the
answer
in
there
was,
when
you
are
in
state
court
applying
federal
law,
you
apply
all
the
federal
law,
not
some
of
the
federal
law,
and
these
defendants
have
the--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
think
i
understand.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
that's
a
close
call,
and
i
can't
find
anything
in
the
court's
precedents
and
things
like
fela
or
1983
to
really
answer
that.
i
guess
the
only
answer
there
is
like
development
in
fela,
or
development
in
1983,
that's
going
to
require
a
case-by-case
analysis.
i
don't
see
that
as
being
a
black-and-white
issue.
what
i
think
is
black
and
white
is
that
if
you
don't
get
your
appeal
from
denial
of
a
qualified
immunity
motion,
and
you
should
prevail
later
but
you've
gone
to
trial
in
the
meantime,
you've
lost
the
benefits
of
your
qualified
immunity,
and
that
is
a
black-and-white
issue,
not
a
gray
issue.
i
think
one
of
the
essential
underpinnings
that
we're
looking
for
in
this
case
is
even-handedness
between
treatments
of
plaintiff's
rights
and
claims
in
1983
in
state
courts
and
defendant's
immunities.
felder
v.
casey
has
been
decided,
so
idaho's
notice
of
claim
statute
allow
this
case
to
be
brought
in
state
court.
if
state
courts
would
be
taken
as
they
found
them,
the
plaintiffs
wouldn't
be
here
at
all.
both,
it's
time
to,
we
think,
look
at
the
other
hand,
look
at
the
question
of
what
happens
to
defendants
who
find
themselves
in
state
courts
for
whatever
reasons...
they
prefer
the
forum
for
convenience,
they
can't
get
concurrence
of
all
the
defendants
to
remove
to
federal
court...
they
should
be
given
the
same
benefits
of
federal
law
as
plaintiffs.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
don't,
because
i
think
the
policy
we're
talking
about
is
what
immunities
can
citizens
of
the
united
states
assert,
and
how
can
they
protect
them,
and
that's
a
policy
that
this
court
says
overrides
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--i
think
the
answer
there
was
given
in
behrens
last
term.
in
that
case,
behrens
said...
the
opinion
in
behrens
was
that
when
you
talk
about
appealability
you
don't
talk
about
whether
you're
going
to
succeed
or
not
succeed,
whether
you've
got
a
good
case
or
a
frivolous
one.
you
talk
about
categories
of
orders.
and
here
is
a
category
of
order,
a
black
and
white
category,
denial
of
a
motion
for
qualified
immunity,
be
it
12(b)(6)
or
summary
judgment,
and
that
is
so
important...
so
important
under
federal
law
that
that's
considered
final.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
symmetry
should
hold
up
to
the
supremacy
clause
and
either
the
burdening
or
in
this
case
the
extinguishment
of
a
federal
immunity.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
complete
elimination
of
a
federal
immunity
of
discovery
from
trial
should
there
be
an
erroneous
trial
court
ruling,
and
there's
always
going
to
be
an
asymmetry
between
these
two
situations
because
of
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
you
have
always
tied
the
individuals'
interest
to
their
function
in
the
state
or
local
government,
or
national
government
in
the
bevins
case.
i
see
that
my
time
is
running.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
bench
at
this
moment,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
thank
you.
the
state
court
balance
has
already
been
upset.
this
case
is
in
the
state
court.
it
would
not
be
in
the
state
court
but
for
felder
v.
casey,
and
i
think
we've
really
got
a
core
issue.
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
think
not.
when
you
talk
about
rule
3,
you're
talking
about
something
that
can
be
complied
with
that
does
not
extinguish
a
substantive
right.
in
this
case,
the
substantive
right
at
issue,
the
right
not
to
go
to
trial,
will
be
absolutely
extinguished
if
there's
an
erroneous--
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
--the
immunity.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
i
would
contend
that
it's
just
the
same.
you
don't
get
your
foot
in
the
door
for
appellate
review
to
protect
your
immunity,
there's
no
procedure
you
didn't
comply
with.
in
felder
at
least,
you
could
have
made
it
there
in
120
days.
the
way
the
idaho
supreme
court
has
ruled,
there's
nothing
that
could
have
been
done
to
get
you
there
as
a
matter
of
right.
in
federal
court,
this
court
has
never
said
you
must
try
to
go
under
1292
rather
than
1291
if
you
want
to
get
a
review
of
a
qualified
immunity
order,
and
there's
no
reason
to
impose
that
possibility
of
having
an
opportunity,
maybe,
for
appellate
review
in
the
state
courts.
it
should
be
the
same
in
both
court
systems
in
order
to
preserve
the
benefits
of
the
immunity.
mr.
michael
s.
gilmore
it
was
a
diversity
case.
but
the
finality
is
tied
to
the
substance
of
what
is
going
on,
and
in
here
it's
the
court's
characterization
of
qualified
immunity
that
determines
whether
it's
final.
1291
doesn't
tell
you
whether
it's
final.
it's
the
court's
characterization
of
the
qualified
immunity,
the
immunity
not
to
go
to
trial,
that
is
the
key
to
finality.
1291
doesn't
tell
you
what's
final.
the
court's
1983
precedents
tell
you
what's
final,
and
this
is
a
final
order
under
those
precedents.
just
one
or
two
other
points...
oh,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
