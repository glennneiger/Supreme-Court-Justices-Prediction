mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
qualified
immunity
that
is
recognized
in
harlow,
and
the
procedure
set
out
in
mitchell,
are
benefits
offered
to
the
states,
including
idaho,
by
congress.
in
this
matter,
the
state
has
declined
twice
the
benefit
of
the
ability
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
qualified
immunity
denial.
first,
idaho's
longstanding
finality
rule
and
its
nonrecognition
of
the
collateral
order
doctrine
are
state
policies
by
the
proper
parties
in
idaho
at
least.
the
idaho
supreme
court--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--it
has
never
confronted
it,
and
based
on
the
jurisprudence
as...
and
i
believe
mr.
gilmore
and
i
both
read
it
it
would
be
unlikely
that
they
would
do
it
because
the
door
is
open
by
another
means,
appellate
rule
12,
that
allows
for
permissive
appeals
to
bring
those
up.
the
permissive
appeal
rule
is
the...
would
be
the
preferred,
under
budell
v.
todd,
matter
to
bring
this--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--in
this
case,
to
illustrate,
having
received
the
order
denying
qualified
immunity
from
the
trial
judge
here,
the
state
could
go
back
to
the
trial
judge
and
ask
for
its
order
permitting
a
permissive
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
the
court
would
issue
its
order.
that
order
would
not
be
binding
on
the
appellate
court
because...
the
idaho
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
would
make
its
own
decision
in
light
of
the--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--exactly.
not...
excuse
me,
not
exactly,
but
that
was
the
model
rule
12
is
modeled
on,
1292.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
no,
it
would
not.
it
could
say
this
would
be
a
frivolous
appeal
and
deny
it,
just
as
it
could
deny
a
54(b)
certificate
if
it
were
asked,
but--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--his
role
under
rule
12
is
to
look
at
requests
for
the
order
and
say
it
should
or
should
not
be
the
subject
of
a
permissive
appeal.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
no.
that
is
not
binding
on
the
supreme
court.
you
look
at...
there
are
two
separate
decisions
made,
one
by
the
trial
judge
to
say
yes
or
no,
and
then
the
supreme
court
acts
on
its
own
in
light
of
what
the
trial
judge
has
said.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
i
would
agree
it
could
be
under
that
scenario.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
i
was
unfortunately
mixing
the
two
court
systems.
the
abuse
of
discretion
rule
that
i
was
thinking
of
would
be
abusing
this
court's
discretion
in
failing
to
accept
that
permissible
appeal.
the
idaho
appellate
rule
12
is
wholly
permissive
in
nature,
but
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
this
court's
discretion
not
to
accept
a
interlocutory
appeal.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
it
might
be...
it
might
occur
only
in
the
circumstance
that
brings
us
here,
where
we
are
in
front
of
the
supreme
court
by
virtue
of--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--in...
it
is
not
likely
that
i
would
be
the
one
who
needed
to
get
here.
it
would
be
the
state.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
well,
the...
because
it
is
permissive
as
to
the
idaho
supreme
court,
then
it
would
only
be
answerable
to
this
court
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
theory,
but
the
solution
to
the
problem
presented
by
the
permissive
nature
of
idaho
appellate
rule
12
is
in
what
was
suggested
by
justice
ginsburg
earlier,
and
that
is
that
this
represents
and
tells
us
that
the
first
opportunity
to
exercise
the
ability
to
get
exactly
what
you
want
in
the
way
of
the
interlocutory
appeal
is
to
take
this
court's...
excuse
me,
take
congress'
route,
and
that
is
to
remove
it
to
federal
court.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
there
are
three
federal
courtrooms
in
idaho,
and
for
a
large
number
of
people
in
idaho
it's
a
very
long
haul
to
a
federal
courtroom,
but
if
the
state
believes
on
behalf
of
its
actors
that
it
must
have
the
right
of
interlocutory
appeal,
then
the
answer
is
to
go
to
federal
court,
not
to
be
subjected
to
the
discretion
of
the
idaho
supreme
court
where
they
may
not--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--i
take
solace
in
the
language
of
felder
v.
casey,
because
it
talks
in
that
case
of
the
natural
and
permissible
consequences
of
the
otherwise
uniformly
applicable
state
rule.
felder
does
not
dictate
that
there
shall
be
an
interlocutory
appeal
rule
in
state
court.
this
finality
rule--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
that's
right.
the...
but
those
burdens
that
you
impose
on
state
courts
under
felder
are
the
burdens
on
the
plaintiff's
exercise
of
her
rights
as
opposed
to
the
state
actors.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
well,
the
state
interest
that's
being
protected
by
the
immunity
rule
belongs
to
the
states,
not
to
the
individuals,
as
has
been
offered
by
petitioners
as
a
reason
for
applying
this
federal
rule
and
this
federal
procedure
in
state
court.
the--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--the
choice
of
how
the
state
is
going
to
exercise
its
actors'
immunities
is
up
to
the
state.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
and
the
state
can
elect
to
expand
on
that
defense
by
paying
for
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
to
defend
them
or
indemnifying
them,
or,
as
was
suggested
earlier,
telling
the
state
actors
when
they
come
to
work,
you
may
be
subject
to
a
civil
rights
case.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
the
state
has
not
abolished
the
federal
defense
in
this
case.
if
the
federal
defense
is
immunity
from
liability,
that
has
to
be
distinguished
from
immunity
from
the
burdens
of
trial
that
they're
trying
to
obtain
by
imposing
this
interlocutory
appeal
rule
on
the
idaho
appellate
system.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
very
much
so,
yes.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
the
distinction
that's
of
importance
here
is
the
manner
in
which
the
interlocutory
appeal
is
taken
in
the
federal
system
compared
to
the
state
system.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
i
wanted
to
answer...
excuse
me.
the
interlocutory
appeal
under
the
federal
system
is
pursuant
to
1291
and
to
the
cohen
collateral
order
doctrine,
and
those
are
first
ideas
that
a
statute
that
doesn't
apply,
an
idea
that
does
not...
has
not
been
accepted
by
the
idaho
courts
for
application
in
state
courts,
and
that
provides
the
complete
remedy
that
the
petitioners
seek,
because
there's
a
court
system
that
allows
for
the
interlocutory
appeal
that
this
case...
excuse
me,
this
court
has
created
in
mitchell.
so
if
they're
objecting
that...
if
their
objection
is
that
we
want
our
interlocutory
appeal,
the
whole
answer
is,
the
case
can
be,
should
have
been
removed
because
that's
where
you
know
you're
going
to
get
your
interlocutory
appeal.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
my
understanding
of
the
distinction
here
would
be
that
if
you
could
have
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
in
wisconsin
you
would
have
still
been
subject
to
the
120-day
rule,
and
that
was
what...
that
limitation
on
bringing
the
state's
rights
was
what
was
fatally
wrong
with
the
wisconsin
notice
of
claim
statute.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
it
has
been
exercised,
yes.
the
state's
position,
as
reflected
in
idaho
appellate
rule
11,
is
that
it
does
not
want
to
hear
interlocutory
appeals,
and
it
may
exercise
that
right
with
respect
to
the
state's
interest.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
that
is
correct.
they
could
do
that.
they
could
direct
the
attorney
general,
perhaps
through
legislation,
likely
through
legislation,
not
to
assert
the
defense,
and--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--they
could
direct
or
make
a
policy
decision
not
to
use
the
benefit
of
the
qualified
immunity
defense.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
the...
if
the
question,
if
i
understand
the
question,
if
it's
collapsing
the
interlocutory
appeal
rule
into
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
then--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--at
the
fullest
extent
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--that's
why
i
looked
at
the
distinction
between
qualified
immunity
as
a
defense
and
the
interlocutory
appeal,
because
irrespective
of
not
being
able
to
exercise
the
interlocutory
appeal
that
they
seek
by
imposing
1291
on
the
state,
the
immunity
defense
will
never
go
away,
and
it
wouldn't
matter
what
kind
of
a
recovery
the
plaintiff
would
obtain
down
below
if
the
state
was,
in
fact,
immune
from
suit
the
supreme
court
would
so
hold.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
if...
i
would
disagree.
we've
looked
at
that
outcome-determinative
issue
as
hard
as
we
can,
and
if
the
answer
is,
does
it
determine
the
outcome
of
the
lawsuit,
the
answer
is
no--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--exactly.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
there
is--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--with
respect
to
the
trial
bell,
yes,
it
cannot
be
unrung,
and
if
you
don't
want
to
hear
that
chimed
in
the
background,
either
change
rule
11
or
remove
it
to
federal
court
where
you're
guaranteed
to
be
in
a
position
to
take
the
interlocutory
appeal
that
they
seek.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
no.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
but
you--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
the
district
court
decided
the
issue
in
our
favor,
thinking
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
clearly
established
law,
and
at
this
juncture
what
the
petitioners
want
is
to
take
their
interlocutory
appeal,
but
they're
not
in
a
court
system
that's
otherwise
available
200
miles
to
the
south
in
moscow
to
take
that
appeal,
and
that's
the...
the
problem
that
they're
faced
with
is
having
made
the
decision,
they're
now
objecting
to
the
effect
of
staying
in
the
state
system.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
that
is
exactly--
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
johnson
v.
jones
shows
us
that
very
explicitly.
qualified
immunity
is
not
an
issue...
excuse
me.
the
interlocutory
appeal
is
not
an
issue
of
1983.
it's
a
creature
of
1291,
and
in
your
analysis,
we
see
it
the
same
way.
when
the
statute
was
passed
there
were
rights
and
immunities,
and
at
some
point...
i
believe
it's
114
years
later...
mitchell
comes
down
from
this
court,
and
now
we
have
interlocutory
appeals
under
1292
and
under
cohen
that
apply
in
state
court,
and
if
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
wants
to
take
advantage
of
the
second
benefit
offered
along
with
the
immunity
itself,
and
that
is
the
interlocutory
appeal
recognized
by
this
court,
they
can
do
so
by
removal.
we
don't
think
that
they
can
do
so
by
engrafting
1291
into
idaho
appellate
rule
11.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
this
court
earlier
in
the
mlb
decision
acknowledged
that
there
was
no
right,
there's
no
requirement
that
the
state
provide
civil
appeals,
and
so
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
is
correct.
we
could
go
that
far.
the
practicalities
are
is
that
is
not
what
has
happened
here.
we
do
have
a
civil
system,
but
that
civil
system
has
chosen
to
look
at
the
finality
rule,
and
we
can
look
at
this
case
in
the
federal
court
system
the
same
way.
if
congress
were
to
amend
1291
and
make
it
a
final
judgment
order
decree
rule
as
opposed
to
a
final
decision
rule,
then
the
underpinnings
in
mitchell
for
allowing
interlocutory
appeals
for
statutory
underpinning
at
least,
would
go
away.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
for
us
to
argue
here.
interestingly,
under
cohen,
of
course,
the
number
of
things
that
now
fit
into
final
decisions
that
this
court
is
going
to
look
at
keeps
growing.
it's
not
shrinking,
and
there's
no
hint
that
the
congress
is
going
to
move
to
a
stricter
rule
than
the
final
decision.
mr.
w.
b.
latta,
jr.
that
is
correct.
when
we
look
at
the
idaho
state
structure,
the
two
opportunities
that
the
state
had
to
take
their
interlocutory
appeal
first
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
second
as
a
matter
of
tactics
that
are
to
be
applied
in
this
case,
we
suggest
that
the
court
decline
the
invitation
to
apply
1291
to
idaho
appellate
rule
11.
congress
provided
a
complete
remedy
in
the
removal
statute.
it
left
to
the
state
their
choices
on
how
to
conduct
their
business
and
balance
these
competing
state
interests,
and
the
balance
is
to
be
struck
for
the
states,
not
in
favor
of
engrafting
a
federal
statute.
thank
you
very
much.
