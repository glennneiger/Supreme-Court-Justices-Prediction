we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-292,
marian
johnson
v.
kristine
fankell.
mr.
gilmore.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think,
mr.
gilmore,
that
if
the
idaho
legislature
had
amended
its
judicial
code
to
allow
appeals
in
this
kind
of
case
that
you
say
the
federal
statute
requires
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
would
have
entertained
this
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
hasn't
extended...
the
court
has
not
said
the
same
with
respect
to
appellate
rules?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
seemed
to...
you
know,
the
one
sense...
i
believe
in
one
sense
orders
seemed
to
say
this
was
not
a
final,
whatever
it
is
that
the
idaho
stature
requires.
my
concern
is
that
since
these
qualified
immunity
is
designed
to
protect
state
officials
i
would
think
the
idaho
legislature
could
probably
extend
the
appeal
right
if
it
wanted
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
double
jeopardy
defense,
which,
you
know,
has
more
of
a
constitutional
basis,
obviously,
than
qualified
immunity,
in
the
abney
case
that
we
decided
some
time
ago,
we
said
a
defendant
could
appeal
that
in
the
federal
system
on
an
interlocutory
basis.
do
you
think
congress
could
say,
no,
we're
not
going
to
allow
that
kind
of
an
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
congress
could
regulate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gilmore.
mr.
latta,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
nonrecognition
of
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
mr.
latta,
do
you
mean
that
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
has
rejected
it,
or
simply
has
never
confronted
it
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
does
the
permissive
appeal
rule
provide,
briefly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
like
federal
1292(b),
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
state
of
idaho
does
recognize
the
doctrine
of
qualified
immunity,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
all
idaho
is
denying
that
the
federal
courts
give
is
the
interlocutory
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
wasn't
it
a
complete
answer
in
felder,
then,
to
say
well,
you
could
have
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin,
rather
than
in
the
circuit
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
district
court
here,
the
district
court
of
bonner
county,
entertained
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
at
the
beginning
of
this
case,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
one
of
the
grounds
for
summary
judgment
was
qualified
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
not
as
if
idaho
said,
we
will
never
recognize
any
qualified
immunity
defense
until
the
day
before
trial.
the
district
court
heard
the
claim
and
simply
decided
against
you,
and
all
the
other
people
are
being
denied,
the
state
people,
is
the
right
to
appeal
that
decision
before
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
latta.
mr.
gilmore,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gilmore.
the
case
is
submitted.
