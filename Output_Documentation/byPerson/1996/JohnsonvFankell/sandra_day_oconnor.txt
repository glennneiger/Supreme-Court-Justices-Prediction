justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
federal
courts...
what
if
congress
passed
a
law
saying,
unlike
the
law
as
written
at
present,
that
when
we
say
there
can
only
be
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment,
we
mean
it,
and
there
are
no
exceptions.
is
there
some
constitutional
reason
why
we
can't
give
that
effect
in
a
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we've
just
given
them
a
right
in
the
federal
courts
to
appeal
based
on
an
interpretation
of
the
law
that
congress
has
applied,
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
have
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who's
going
to
enforce
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
don't
take
a
case,
how
are
you
going
to
get
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
had
though
maybe
the
closest
case
supporting
petitioner
was
felder
v.
casey.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
case
and
the
reasons
for
it
with
the
situation
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
wasn't
dealing
with
the
appeal
problem,
it
was
dealing
with
a
notice
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
principle,
at
least,
there
was
that
there
were
times
when
we
were
going
to
impose
certain
requirements
on
state
courts
in
connection
with
1983
suits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
might
even
go
so
far,
i
suppose,
as
saying
there's
no
right
to
even
have
an
appellate
structure
at
all
in
idaho
for
a
civilian
civil
dispute
like
this.
