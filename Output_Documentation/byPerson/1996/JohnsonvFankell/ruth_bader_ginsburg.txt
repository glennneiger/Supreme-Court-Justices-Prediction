but
if
they
were
merely
individuals
there
wouldn't
be
any
kind
of
immunity
that
they
could
lay
hold
of.
it's
only
because
they're
state
officers
that
they
have
this
qualified
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let
me
ask
one
anterior
question
about
where
the
rule-making
authority
is.
i
don't
recall
the
idaho
counterpart
to
1292(b)
that
gives
the
discretion
only
at
the
appellate
level,
is
that
a
rule
of
the
court,
that
the
courts
made
up,
or
is
it
a
legislative
enactment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
source
of
it
is
the
idaho
supreme
court,
not
the
idaho
legislature?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
of
those--
--suppose
a
state
were
to
say
that
we
don't...
for
state
law
purposes
have
this
immunity.
our
officers
don't
have
this
immunity.
under
1983,
would
the
state
officer
nonetheless
be
able
to
claim
an
immunity
that
his
state
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
thinks
the
officer
should
not
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
mean
his
1983
immunity
which
he
would
get
is
a
federal
source,
but
the
state
says,
just
as
municipalities
can
waive
their
sovereign
immunity,
that
we
don't
want
our
officers
to
be
any
less
responsible
than
anyone
else
for
the
torts
they
commit,
so
our
officers
will
not
be
shielded
by
immunity.
now,
would
there
be
a
federal
interest
in
saying,
state,
in
defiance
of
your
policies,
we
are
going
to
insist
that
in
1983
cases
these
people
be
shielded
by
qualified
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
the
federal
interest,
then,
is
superior,
that
even
though
a
state
can
waive
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
the
state
cannot
waive
this
federally
granted
immunity
for
its
officers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
federal
policy
in
shielding
the
state
officer
is...
tugs
against
the
state
policy
no
matter
how
strong
that
state
policy
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the...
this
is
a
right
that
does
have
a
constitutional
underpinning,
double
jeopardy,
and
i
think
the
precedent
you
cited
said
states
might
very
well
want
to
adopt
that
policy
as
their
own,
but
it
seemed
to
me
it
wasn't
your
brief,
it
was
i
think
the
state's
brief
in
support
of
you
that
just
cited
abney
and...
sort
of
en
passant,
but
that
would
be
a
pretty
big
thing
to
say,
yes,
we
want
the
officer
to
be
shielded
here
in
1983,
even
though
we
recognize
the
price
might
be
that
the
states
no
longer
have
a
choice
that
some
of
them
thought
they
had
about
double
jeopardy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
another
oddity
here
that
in
addition
to
the
states
saying
their
own
state
court
is
not
sufficiently
the
guardian
of
the
state
officer's
rights,
it's
that
these
cases
are
removable
by
the
defendant,
are
they
not?
so
if
you're
complaining
about
idaho
procedure
being
less
generous
to
the
defendant,
why
couldn't
the
defendant
remove?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
didn't
know
about
that
they
had
this
final
judgment,
firm
final
judgment
rule
and
that
they
didn't
allow
interlocutory
appeals
except
in
specified
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
does
idaho
have
the
collateral
order
rule?
does
it
have
it
in
cohen
v.
beneficial,
because
you
would
have
know
about
that
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
have
removed...
in
any
case,
wouldn't
one
factor,
if
one
wants...
if
a
federal
court
is
going
to
tell...
if
this
case
is
going
to
tell
the
state,
change
your
procedure
for
these
cases
only,
that
the
defendant
who
is
asking
for
that
could
have
gotten
himself
into
the
federal
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
apart
from
the...
if
you
have
multiple
defendants
and
they...
what
interest
would
any
of
them
have
in
not
getting
into
federal
court
on
a
question
of
the
qualified
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let
me
ask
how
far
you
would
take
that,
because
there's
one
respect
in
which
idaho
is
more
generous
in
allowing
interlocutory
appeals,
and
that
is
from
a
new
trial
order,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
suppose
we
had
a
case
where
a
plaintiff
had
prevailed,
and
then
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
said,
sorry,
i'm
going
to
wipe
that
out...
let
me
see
if
i've
got
that
reversed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
so
where
it
would
be...
the
state
procedure
would
be
to
the
defendant's
advantage
to
take
the
interlocutory
appeal,
but
we
wouldn't
be
allowed
that
in
the
federal
system.
can
the
plaintiff
then
say,
no
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
new
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gilmore,
in
the
reverse
situation
in
cases,
erie
cases
in
federal
court
where
state
law
is
governing
just
as
1983
federal
law
is
governing,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
said
there
is
an
essential
character
to
the
federal
court
system,
and
things
that
pertain
to
that
essential
character
don't
give
way
to
the
states.
i
mean,
think
of
if
a
state
allowed
an
interlocutory
appeal
whenever
the
lawyers
liked
it.
you
had...
you've
got
diversity
cases
certainly
wouldn't
have
the
federal
courts
copy
that,
so
is
there
a...
should
there
be
some
kind
of
symmetry?
just
as
the
federal
courts
don't
have
to
make
themselves
over
in
the
state
court's
image,
the
state
courts
ought
to
be
allowed
their
essential
characteristics,
including
how
firm
they
want
their
final
judgment
rule
to
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
latta,
i
thought
that
idaho's
creation
of
that
rule,
which
does
modify
1292(b),
is
to
make
it
totally
discretionary
on
its
part.
idaho
has
a
firm
final
judgment
rule.
it's
enacted
a
provision
for
interlocutory
review
at
its
sole
pleasure.
not
the
trial
judge's
approval
but
just...
so
how
could
it
abuse
its
discretion
when
it's
deliberately
created
a
rule
that
gives
it
a
prerogative
to
do
as
it
pleases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
might
be
equally
inconvenient
for
your
client,
given
the
distance
that
mr.
gilmore
just
told
us
about,
that
the
state
court
is
much
more
accessible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
suppose
your
case
would
be
harder
if
congress
had
written
into
1983,
made
it
a
nice
neat
package
with
a
substantive
right
and
a
procedural
right
all
rolled
into
one,
but
the
interlocutory
appeal
that
we're
talking
about
comes
not
from
the
bivens
claim
or
the
1983
claim,
it
comes
from
the
standard
1291,
the
collateral
order
that
applies
as
a
matter
of
federal
procedural
law
to
all
federal
courts
on
all
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing
unique
to
1983
about
1291
and
the
collateral
order
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
felder
v.
casey
just
matches
what
happens
on
the
diversity
side,
doesn't
it?
you've
got
rule
3
that
says
the
case
commences
when
you
file
the
complaint,
but
if
the
state
law
says
that's
not
good
enough,
you
have
to
serve
it.
that
state
rule
will
apply
in
the
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case,
so
felder's
just
the
match
for
that,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
the
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not...
and
the
difference
in
felder
is,
if
you
didn't
give
that
notice
that
the
state
had,
you
don't
get
your
foot
in
the
door
in
court
at
all.
it's
quite
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
extent
to
which
these
finality
notions
are
tied
into
federal
substantive
rights
is
strained,
isn't
it,
when
one
of
the
threads
that
you're
tugging
is
the
collateral
order
rule
comes
out
of
cohen
v.
beneficial,
which
i
think
was
a
diversity
case.
