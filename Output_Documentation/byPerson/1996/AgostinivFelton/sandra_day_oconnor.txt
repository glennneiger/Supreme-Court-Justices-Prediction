justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
that's
part
of
the
problem,
general
dellinger,
really,
because
we're
reviewing,
are
we,
an
action
by
the
district
court
judge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
60(b)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
have
to
find
that
that
judge
abused
discretion
in
refusing
the
60(b)
reopening,
and
yet
that
judge
could
look
at
aguilar
and
say,
i
just
don't
have
room
to
do
that.
that's
the
supreme
court's
holding.
how
am
i
supposed
to
reopen
this
case?
how
do
we
deal
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
wean,
it
isn't
as
though
it's
coming
directly--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
this
court--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we're
reviewing
the
action
of
the
district
court,
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
what
standard
do
we
apply
there?
how
did
the
district
court
abuse
its
discretion
in
saying,
boy,
it
isn't
up
to
me?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
continuing
injunction?
does
that
somehow
enter
into
the
calculus
and
make
your
response
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
an
argument...
mr.
geller,
you
can't
seriously
expect
this
court
to
accept
that
argument,
that
teachers
are
unprofessional
and
uncontrollable.
i
mean,
that
just
flies
in
the
face
of
experience
and
reality.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
a
public
school
teacher
who
is
employed
by
the
state
and
is
told
not
to
inculcate
religion
when
teaching
remedial
reading
will
follow
that
instruction.
i
think
that
assumption
is
a
fair
one
for
us
to
make.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
had...
new
york
had
19
years
of
title
i
education
programs
without
a
single
identifiable
incident
of
a
public
school
teacher
inculcating
religion,
and
it
worked
fine,
until
this
court
got
the
notion
that
that
program
somehow
failed
the
establishment
clause
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
the
type
of
aid
that's
given
actually
enables
the
sign
language
interpreter
to
inculcate
religion,
if
that's
what's
being
taught.
in
a
sense,
it
goes
beyond
what
the
parties
are
asking
for
here,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
are
cases
come
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
for
30
years
now,
new
york
city
has
been
providing
remedial
instruction
on
guidance
counseling
to
economically
disadvantaged
school
children.
these
services
had
been
provided
with
federal
funds
pursuant
to
a
congressionally
enacted
program
commonly
called
title
i.
in
order
to
receive
title
i
funds,
school
district,
like
the
one
in
new
york
city,
are
required
to
provide
title
i
services
to
as
many
eligible
children
in
their
districts
as
they
can,
whether
those
children
attend
public
or
private
schools.
although
only
about
10%
of
new
york
city
school
children
attend
private
schools.
almost
all
of
those
private
schools
are
affiliated
with
a
religion.
thus,
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york
has
been
required
to
provide
title
i
services
to
some
children
attending
religious
schools.
for
some
years,
the
board
provided
title
i
services
to
children
attending
religious
schools
from
the
premises
of
those
schools.
these
services
were
provided
by
publicly
employed
teachers
and
guidance
counselors
who
often
travel
from
school
to
school.
they
were
assigned
to
schools
without
regard
to
their
religious
preferences.
these
employees
were
also
given
instructions
not
to
inculcate
religion
in
the
course
of
their
duties
and
not
to
cooperate
with
religious
school
officials
any
more
than
necessary
to
provide
the
services.
the
services
themselves
could
only
supplement
the
level
of
remedial
instruction
and
guidance
counseling
services
already
provided
by
the
private
schools.
the
title
i
services
had
to
be
purely
secular
in
content.
in
1978,
six
federal
taxpayers
sued
the
new
york
city
board
on
the
grounds
that
new
york’s
program
to
provide
title
i
services
to
religious
school
students
at
their
school
violated
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
seven
years
later,
in
a
case
called
aguilar
versus
felton,
this
court
agreed
with
the
taxpayers.
this
court,
in
aguilar,
reasoned
that
public
employees
who
work
in
religious
schools
would
be
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
resist
the
pressures
of
the
pervasively
sectarian
atmosphere
present
in
those
schools,
and
would
begin
to
read
religious
messages
into
their
instruction
or
counseling.
the
aguilar
majority
found
that
the
supervision
necessary
to
prevent
inculcation
of
religion
in
the
schools
created
an
excessive
entanglement
between
church
and
state
and
accordingly
violated
the
establishment
clause.
on
remand,
from
that
decision,
the
district
court
entered
an
injunction
permanently
enjoining
the
new
york
city
board
of
education
from
offering
title
i
services
on
the
premises
of
religious
schools.
bound
by
this
injunction,
the
board
explored
other
methods
of
serving
the
10%
of
students
who
attend
that
religious
schools.
the
most
common
alternative
was
to
provide
the
title
i
services
in
mobile
classroom
buses
parked
near
the
religious
schools;
sometimes
at
the
very
curbside
of
those
schools.
as
expected,
the
cost
of
renting
these
buses
or
leasing
them
was
high.
the
board
spent
over
$100
million
to
provide
these
off
campus
services,
since
our
decision
in
aguilar
was
handed
down.
last
year,
the
board
of
education
moved
in
the
federal
district
court
for
release
from
the
injunction
under
rule
60(b)(5)
of
the
federal
rules.
rule
60
(b)(5)
gives
the
court
the
power
to
excuse
a
party
from
judgment
in
a
case
when
it
is
no
longer
equitable
that
the
judgment
should
have
perspective
application.
the
school
board
argued
that
the
circumstances
had
changed
since
we
decided
aguilar,
so
that
it
was
no
longer
equitable
to
enforce
the
injunction.
first,
they
claimed
that
the
exorbitant
costs
of
complying
with
the
injunction
were
changed
factual
circumstance.
second,
the
board
claimed
that
aguilar
was
no
longer
a
good
law
because
five
of
the
justices
in
a
case
called
kiryas
joel
had
recently
called
for
aguilar
to
be
reconsidered.
third,
the
board
argued
that
aguilar
itself
had
been
undermined
by
our
more
recent
decisions,
specifically
witters
versus
washington
department
of
services
for
the
blind
and
zobrest
versus
catalina
foothills
school
district.
the
district
court
denied
the
board's
rule
60(b)(5)
motion
largely
on
the
ground
that
it
was
bound
by
aguilar
as
precedent.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
and
order
that
relief
be
granted
under
rule
60(b)(5).
although
we
find
that
the
high
cost
of
complying
with
the
injunction
do
not
constitute
a
change
in
the
factual
circumstances,
that
change
was
anticipated,
and
that
the
statements
of
five
justices
in
kiryas
joel
do
not
constitute
a
change
in
the
law,
we
agree
with
the
board
that
our
decisions
are
subsequent
decisions
and
witters
and
zobrest
have
eroded
the
rationale
upon
which
the
aguilar
relied.
in
witters
we
upheld
the
program
that
allowed
a
blind
student
to
use
public
vocational
training
funds
to
attend
the
religious
school,
and
in
zobrest
we
held
that
a
public
school
district
could
pay
for
a
signlanguage
interpreter
to
assist
a
student
who
attended
a
religious
high
school.
these
recent
cases
have
abandoned
the
presumption
that
public
employees
will
inculcate
religion
simply
because
they
teach
in
a
classroom
located
on
the
premises
of
a
colloquial
school.
without
this
presumption,
the
system
of
supervising
title
i
teachers
that
new
york
city
already
had
in
place
is
sufficient
to
ensure
that
title
i
services
remain
secular
and
that
the
system
is
not
an
excessive
entanglement
between
church
and
state.
accordingly,
we
find
aguilar
as
no
longer
good
law.
there
has
been
a
significant
change
in
the
law
wanting
rule
60(b)
relief.
we
furthermore
conclude
that
the
board’s
use
of
rule
60(b)(5)
is
proper
because
it
arises
in
the
narrow
context
of
the
civil
case
where
a
party
labors
under
a
continuing
injunction.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
join
in
full
and
in
which
justice
breyer
joins
in
part;
