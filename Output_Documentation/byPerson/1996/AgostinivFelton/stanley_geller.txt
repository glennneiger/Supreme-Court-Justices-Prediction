mr.
stanley
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
tried
very
hard
to
adhere
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
we
have
pointed
out
repeatedly
that
this
case
deals
with
not
the
statute...
and
i
hear
questions
all
about
the
statute.
when
we
brought
this
case
first,
many
years
ago,
we
brought
it
to
challenge
the
new
york
city
plan
for
title
i
in
religious
schools.
and
i
point
this
out
to
you
at
the
outset,
because
something
has
been
said
about
97
percent
of
the
aid
in
title
i
going
to
public
schools.
that,
of
course,
raises
no
question.
there
is
no
question
about
using
public
funds
for
public
school
students.
now,
hear
this
fact
about...
and
it
is
a
fact--
mr.
stanley
geller
--let
me...
yes.
i
have
this
problem,
your
honor,
and
a
very
serious
problem.
the
statute
may
speak
of
nonpublic
students.
here's
what
happens,
or
happened
within
the
title
i
program
in
new
york
city.
ninety-nine
point--
mr.
stanley
geller
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stanley
geller
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stanley
geller
oh,
right,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
geller
yes.
my
problem
is
with...
constitutionally
with
the
religious
schools
because
of
the
establishment
clause,
but
by
way
of
answering
your
question--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i
have
no
problem--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i
don't--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i...
to
the
extent
that
i
see
a
free
exercise
problem,
i
see
it
as
being
seriously
overcome
because
of
the
establishment
clause
problems.
i
have
never
agreed
that
the
free
exercise
clause
enters
into
this
picture
at
all.
i
do
not
believe
that
religious
school...
religious
schools,
or
religious
school
students
have
a
free
exercise
right
to
receive
public
funds.
i'm
of
the
belief,
and
i
think...
and
it
happens
all
the
time,
that
a
public...
a
government,
federal,
state
or
local
can
provide
funds
for
public
schools
and
public
school
students
without
providing
them
for--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i--
mr.
stanley
geller
--oh,
i
don't
have
to
adopt
that
view,
because
i
can
see
where,
if
you
had
the
religious
school
students
obtaining
their
remedial
instruction
in
public
schools
like
the
public
school
students
do,
then
they
would
be
able
to
get
that
instruction.
mr.
stanley
geller
that
that
alternative--
mr.
stanley
geller
--that
question,
your
honor,
contains
the
assumption
that
it
is
so.
the
respondents--
mr.
stanley
geller
--the
respondents--
mr.
stanley
geller
--if
the
assumption
was
true,
it
would
bear
some
weight,
but
the
fact,
the
actual
fact
is--
mr.
stanley
geller
--it
would,
if
it
were
factually
warranted.
may
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
factually
warranted,
that
in
the
school
year
'86-'87
the
chancellor
and
the
board
of
education
offered
a
program
to
the
religious
schools
in
new
york
city
whereby
80
percent...
80
percent
of
those
schools
and
their
students
who
are
entitled
to
participate
in
title
i
could
go
to
public
schools
to
receive
their
remedial
instructions
that
were
within
10
minutes
by
walking
or
by
bus
to
the
matching
public
schools,
and
they
refused
that
out
of
hand...
out
of
hand.
which
brings
up
another
question
that
i
would
point
out
to
the
court.
not
only
does
the
new
york
city
program,
as
it
was
in
effect
in
1985,
not
only
are
99.56
percent
of
the
so-called
nonstudent,
nonpublic
students
in
the
program
go
to
parochial
schools,
but
the
fact
is
that
this
is
not...
this
is
not
a
program
that
flows
to
the
students,
and
i'll
tell
you
why,
because
the
program
cannot
even
get
to
the
parochial
school
students
unless
their
parochial
school
authorities
decide
to
enter
into
the
program.
it
doesn't
begin
to
flow
directly
to
the
students.
and
when
the
religious
schools,
the
parochial
schools
have
opted
out
of
the
program,
as
they
did
in
'86-'87,
then
50
percent
of
the
students
that
had
been
in
the
program
were
no
longer
in
the
program.
the
new
york
city...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
one
other
factual
point
that
i
wish
to
make,
because
it
was
made
for
me
by
the
petitioners.
they
stated
that
11,000
of
the
22,000
religious
school
students
who
receive
this
aid...
that's
50
percent
of
them,
50
percent
of
the
participating
students,
50
percent
of
the
entire
religious
school
body
receive
title
i
instruction.
that's
an
enormous
amount
of
instruction.
it
is
not
the
situation
that
has
been
brought
up
of
a
single
deaf-mute
student
in
zobrest
who
has
the
benefit
of
a
sign
language
interpreter.
how
does
that
affect
the...
impose
on
the
religious
school?
it
doesn't
affect
them
at
all.
but
when
you
have
a
huge
body
of
religious
school
students
in
a
program
like
new
york
city
receiving
this
aid,
then
it
is
no
longer
the
attenuated
aid
that
is
readily
distinguishable
in
zobrest.
i
did
want
to
cover
a
point
that
justice
o'connor--
mr.
stanley
geller
--they
can
provide--
mr.
stanley
geller
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
don't
see
how
it
advances
the
mission.
mr.
stanley
geller
it
does
not.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
don't
see
how
that
does
at
all,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
when
in
everson
v.
board
of
education
that
was
permitted,
the
court
noted
that
this
was
the
very
verge
of
the
aid,
if
it
could
be
called
aid,
that
would
go
to
a
public
school,
religious
schools
or
religious
school
students.
mr.
stanley
geller
they...
they--
mr.
stanley
geller
--they
can
do
that
under
allen,
yes.
i
can't
go
back
on
allen
any
more
than
i
think
the
court
can--
mr.
stanley
geller
--what?
mr.
stanley
geller
i
don't
go
back
on--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i
don't
go
back
on
zobrest.
mr.
stanley
geller
the
line
that
respondents
draw,
your
honor,
is
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
as
clear
as
clear
can
be.
i
can't
go
back
on
allen,
although
i
never
agreed
with
it,
yes.
you
can
lend
books
to
religious
schools
and
religious
school
students.
but
the
distinction
was
made
in
lemon
by
then
chief
justice
burger,
who
said,
teachers
are
different
from
books,
and
our
line
is,
don't
send
teachers
in.
you
can't
change
what
books
do
because--
mr.
stanley
geller
--because
teachers
are
uncontrollable,
and
i
point
this
out--
[laughter]
yes.
yes,
and...
uncontrollable
and
sometimes
very
unprofessional.
i
hear
arguments
made
that
we
should
rely
on
the
professionality--
mr.
stanley
geller
--when
i
said
teachers
are
uncontrollable,
i
may
have
used
a
strong
word,
but
not
much
stronger
than
chief
justice
burger
did
in
lemon,
and
when
he
pointed
out
that
books
are
controllable
because
once
they're
printed
and
they
contain
nothing
that
offends
the
establishment
clause,
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
stanley
geller
those
many
years
of
nonreported
violations
are
very
easily
explained,
and
justice
breyer
asked
questions
about...
to
mr.
crotty
about
judge
friendly's
opinion
on
that
point,
and
i
believe
that's
the...
that
speaks
much
better
than
i
could
ever
speak.
the
reason
that
there
are
no
reported
violations
is
because
the
only
people
that
could
report
a
violation
would
be
the
violators
themselves.
what
system
of
surveillance
can
prevail
in
a
small
classroom,
whether
it's
inside
a
religious
school
or
in
a
bus?
what
system
will
disclose
violations
of
the
establishment
clause
or
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
teacher
that
is--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i
didn't--
mr.
stanley
geller
--in
this
particular
case,
i
would
assume
it's
necessary.
this
isn't
merely
aguilar.
this
goes
back
to
lemon
v.
kurtzman,
marburger,
meek...
it
was
felt
by
this
court--
mr.
stanley
geller
--is
it
any
easier
to
bug
the
buses--
mr.
stanley
geller
--well--
mr.
stanley
geller
--that's--
mr.
stanley
geller
--my
answer
to
that
has
to
be,
your
honor,
one
case
at
a
time.
we
are
opposing
the
buses
as
mere
adjuncts
of
the
religious
schools
in
a
case
now
before
the
second
circuit,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
stanley
geller
--if
you
want
an
honest
answer
from
these
respondents,
yes,
the
buses
are
a
violation,
because
we
see
little
difference
between
the
buses
right
outside
the
door
of
the
religious
school
and
a
title
i
classroom
inside
the
door.
the
students
tramp
out
the
door,
they
go
into
class
a
few
steps
away,
and
then
they
go
back,
all
fitted
within
the
religious
school
schedule,
but
as
i
say,
that's
another
case.
but
what
we're
saying
is
simply
that
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
several
precedents
was
yes,
when
you
have
public
school
teachers
inside
a
parochial
school,
then
you
have
to
take
some
steps
to
see
that
they
don't
offend
the
establishment
clause,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
isn't
original
with
us.
the
board
of
education
in
aguilar
in
the
original
case
vaunted
the
system
of
surveillance
that
they
had.
of
course,
it
was
a
paper
system
that
didn't
work,
because
you
cannot
send
an
inspector
into
a
classroom
of
one
teacher
and
10
students
and
expect
the
teacher
not
to
be
aware
that
he's
being
inspected
for
all
kinds
of
things.
mr.
stanley
geller
my
answer
to
that,
justice
breyer,
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
agree
that
there
is
no
other
way.
i
think
that
there
are
cases
coming
up
now
in
which
this
court
could
address
the
merits
of
the
determination
in
aguilar.
mr.
stanley
geller
that
is
odd,
but
i
was
going
to
answer
justice
breyer
by
saying,
justice
kennedy,
that
that
is
the
precise
situation
in
which
many,
many
parties
before
this
court
have
found
themselves,
and
they
have
had
to
wait,
some
of
them
many,
many
years,
to
have
a
case
come
before
this
court...
very
few
cases...
in
which
the
determination
in
their
case
is
overruled.
that--
mr.
stanley
geller
--yes,
the
case
that
respondents
have
now...
it's
suspended
pending
this
case...
in
the
second
circuit
court,
in
which
we
are
challenging
the
present,
what
we
call
the
alternative
plan
in
new
york
city
which
relies
largely
on
busing.
we
are
challenging
that,
and
we
are
challenging
it
on
the
theory
that
it
is
no
different
from
the
situation
in
aguilar
in
substance.
if
we
prevail
in
that
case,
that
case
could
come
to--
mr.
stanley
geller
--oh,
the
opponents
take
precisely
the
same
position
that
they're...
that
the
petitioners
are
taking
in
this
case,
yes,
that
aguilar
is
no
longer
the
law,
and
we--
mr.
stanley
geller
--the
district
court
already--
mr.
stanley
geller
--the
district
court
distinguished
the
buses
from
the--
mr.
stanley
geller
--depending
on
the
facts
of
the
case
that
are
developed.
mr.
stanley
geller
well,
it's
not
the
job
of
lower
courts,
but
what
has
happened
in
the
case...
the
walker
case
in
california
is,
that
went
past
the
court
of
appeals
out
there,
was
that
the
court
of
appeals...
that
was
a
chapter
ii
case,
a
title
ii
case
on
books
and
equipment
rather
than
a
title
i
case,
but
there
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
on
the
basis
of
the
change
in
the
law
that
the
petitioners
here
argue--
mr.
stanley
geller
--yes.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
never--
mr.
stanley
geller
--all
right,
justice
scalia...
i
never
got
to
the
second
point
of
my
answer
to
justice
breyer,
and
that
is,
it
was
suggested
by
justice
ginsburg.
if
it
cannot
be
done
under
present
rules,
you
don't
break
these
rules.
you
don't
bend
them.
instead,
you
promulgate
a
new
rule.
and
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
if
there's
such
a
hardship
problem
in
this
type
of
case,
then
the
court
should
recommend
a
rule
to
congress,
and
congress
should
promulgate
it
as
part
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
you
can
have
a
rehearing
out
of
date.
mr.
stanley
geller
oh,
well,
that
was
the
third
part
of
my
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
the
citizens
of
this
great
country
have
devised
a
myriad
of
ways
to
develop
cases
in
order
to
test
prior
determinations
of
this
court.
i
do
not...
i
think
it's
just
a
fiction
that
there
cannot
be
a
case
developed
within
a
state,
within
a
locality,
where
the
principle
cannot
be
tested
that
public
school
teachers
or
guidance
counselors
cannot
go
into--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i
thought
it
never
had.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
must
not
be,
because
i
thought
that...
i
thought
that
this
case
was
unprecedented.
mr.
stanley
geller
i
am
not...
i
said
that...
yes,
i
must
admit.
i
think
we
all
are--
mr.
stanley
geller
--yes,
i
did
answer
that.
mr.
stanley
geller
out
of
time,
and
before
a
bench
that
was
so
different
from
the
bench
that
sat
on
aguilar,
with
not
even...
not
even
a
single
justice
here
that
indicates
that
he
would
change
his
vote?
mr.
stanley
geller
well,
having
had
to
admit
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
gondack--
[laughter]
--i
accept
your--
mr.
stanley
geller
i
do
not
see
it
at
this
late
date.
one
of
the...
and
this
would
be
an
answer
to
something
that
justice
o'connor
suggested.
this
is
an
ongoing
injunction,
but...
and--
mr.
stanley
geller
--that
i
obtained?
mr.
stanley
geller
yes...
yes--
mr.
stanley
geller
--i
was
about
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
suggestion,
and
it
will
answer
yours.
sure
there
was
a
way.
if...
if
the
law
had
really
changed
here,
and
there
was
a
change
either
in
the
law
or
the
factual
circumstances,
yes,
under
rules
of
equity
you
might
modify
an
injunction,
perhaps
even
an
injunction
that's
a
mandate
on
a
constitutional
point.
but
look
what
happened
here.
for
12
years
after
this
injunction
issued,
the
board
of
education
was
faced
with
the
same
cost
and
the
same
inefficiency,
and
they
did
nothing
about
it
until
kiryas
joel
and
the
comments
that
were
made
in
kiryas
joel
about
aguilar,
which
don't
have
the
binding
effect
of
law.
but
if
the
law
had
really
changed,
and
if
the
factual
circumstances
had
changed,
yes,
under
rules
of
equity
that
rule
60(b)
subsumes
these
parties
could
have...
the
petitioners
could
have
brought
a
case,
but
they
didn't
do
that,
and
the
law
didn't
change.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
very
comments
in
kiryas
joel
showed
very
clearly
that
the
law
hadn't
changed,
and
the
comments
were
that
aguilar
perhaps
should
be
overruled
in
a
proper
case,
and
we
say
this
is
not
a
proper
case.
mr.
stanley
geller
yes.
yes,
if
you
had
done
that,
if
the
court
had
done
it
in
zobrest,
but
i
have
to
emphasize
how
much
respondents
believe
that
zobrest
is
distinguishable
from
aguilar
and
grand
rapids
and
meek,
and
the
extent
of
the
aid
that
goes...
that
flows
to
the
public
school.
of
course,
it
ultimately
flows--
mr.
stanley
geller
--in
a
way
it
does,
yes,
your
honor,
but
with
a
single
student.
look
at
the
difference.
in
this
case,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
50
percent
of
the
students,
11,000
out
of
22,000,
are
being
given
aid,
and
what
is
the--
mr.
stanley
geller
--but
it
would
still
be
much
more
attenuated
than
the
aid...
that's
the
word
that
this
court--
mr.
stanley
geller
--well,
the
question,
your
honor,
is,
did
you
apply...
did
you
adopt
a
principle
that
overrules
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
held
that...
it's
sometimes
called
massive
aid,
or
funding
of
religious
schools,
is
unconstitutional
as
in
grand
rapids,
as
in
meek
v.
pittenger?
i
don't
think
so,
and
the
word
that
was
used
in
the
court's
opinion
in
zobrest
was
that
the
aid
that
was
given
to
that
student
was
only
attenuated
aid.
mr.
stanley
geller
thank
you.
