general...
general--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
dellinger,
may
i
deflect
you
for
a
moment,
because
you're
launching
right
into
the
merits
as
you
did
in
your
briefs,
and
you
have
to
get
your
foot
in
the
door
properly.
i
do
not
know
of
any
use,
ever,
of
60(b)
such
as
we
see
here,
essentially
to
gain
rehearing
by
this
court,
so
if
you
could
spend
just
a
couple
of
moments--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the
two
cases
that
are...
are
there
not
cases
involving
state
law
similar
to
title
i,
one
in
louisiana
and
the
other,
is
it
in
minnesota?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dellinger--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dellinger--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
it
so
that
under
our
precedent
a
district
judge
is
locked
in?
he
has
no
authority
to
overturn
a
decision
of
this
court
and,
indeed,
the
district
judge
would
have
abused
his
discretion
if
he
said,
i
predict
that
the
supreme
court
is
going
to
overrule
aguilar?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
said,
i
think
quite
correctly--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
they...
there
was
nothing
that
they
could
do,
so
if
we're
going
to
be
candid
about
what's
involved
here,
isn't
it
really
a
request
for
rehearing
by
this
court,
and
the
60(b)
is
just
a
pass-through,
because
stage
1
and
stage
2
cannot
do
anything
but
reject
the
application?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
add
to
that
that
this
court
did
tell
district
judges
in
quite
clear
terms,
it's
not
your
job
to
predict
that
the
supreme
court's
going
to
over--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
can't
do
that.
only
we
can
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then
perhaps,
general
dellinger,
we
should
have,
or
congress
should
authorize
some
proceeding
for
rehearing
out
of
time
by
this
court,
but
we're
talking
about
stages
below
this
court
where
they...
there
is
nothing
that
they
can
do
except
pass
the
question
up
to
this
court
and
then
this
court
will
rehear
a
case
that
was
decided--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
that's
not
quite
so,
is
it?
even
in
the
title...
the
cases
like
title
i
that
are
in
district
courts
there's
a
record
being
developed.
it's
a
different
case,
and...
isn't
that
so,
in
those--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
60(b)
is
a
rule
of
civil
procedure
addressed
to
the
district
court
and
here
the
district
court
can't
do
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller,
on
the
question
of
cases...
you
mentioned
there
were
cases.
i
am
aware
of
only
two.
you
are
au
courant
in
this
field.
other
than
the
case
in
louisiana,
and
the
one
in
minnesota,
both
in
district
courts,
is
there
any
other
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
that
answer.
i
though
this
court
had
said
that's
not
the
job
of
lower
courts.
it's
for
the
supreme
court
to
overrule
its
own
precedents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you...
are
you
familiar
with
the
gondack
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller,
i
believe
that
was
a
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
was
perhaps
2
years
out
of
time,
not
as
far
out
as...
now
it's
very
much
out
of
time
by
our
rule.
was
it
a
question...
i
don't
recall...
of
action
on
a
cert
petition
rather
than
a
decision
on
the
merits?
i
may...
i
don't
know...
i
don't
recall
that
gondack
was
a
decision
on
the
merits
as
this
was,
with
a
sharply
divided
court.
i
thought
that
that
was
a
case
involving
a
denial
of
a
petition
for
review,
and
then
a
rehearing
on
that
denial.
