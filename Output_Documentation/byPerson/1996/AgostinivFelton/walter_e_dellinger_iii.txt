mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
ask
you
today
to
overrule
aguilar
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
establishment
clause
decisions
and
because
it
continues
to
impose
burdens
that
seriously
impair
the
federal
government's
critical
title
i
program.
i
would
like
to
discuss
both
the
reasons
why
we
believe
that
this
is
an
appropriate
procedural
posture
for
the
reconsideration
of
aguilar,
and
why
we
believe
that
a
decision
to
overrule
aguilar
need
not
require
any
major
doctrinal
revisions
of
this
court's
establishment
clause
jurisprudence.
in
brief,
the
critical
features
that
support
the
constitutionality
of
on-premises
services
under
title
i
and
the
lifting
of
the
outstanding
injunction
are
these.
unlike
all
of
this
court's
other
primary
and
secondary
parochial
school
aid
cases,
this
case
involves
an
act
of
congress
that
provides
new
and
additional
resources
to
both
public
and
private
school
students.
ninety-seven
percent
of
the
funding
under
title
i
goes
to
children
who
are
in
public
schools.
these
services
are
completely
secular.
they
are
required
by
law
only
to
supplement
and
not
to
supplant
any
necessary
educational--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no,
i
am
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i
intend
to
suggest
by
that
is
that
many
of
the
state
acts
that
this
court
has
struggled
over
provided
funds...
since
there
was
a
background
of
public
education
provided
funds
just
for
nonpublic
schools.
the
ohio
act
in
wolman
v.
walters
was
an
$88
million
appropriations
for
the
nonpublic
schools.
this
is
a
national
act,
where
congress
is
for
the
first
time
in
1965
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
low
income,
learning-disabled
and
learning-handicapped
children
nation-wide
in
providing
funds
to
so
broad
a
group.
of
the
6.4
million,
for
example,
6.2
million
went
to
public
schools.
it's
so
broad
a
group.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
we
do
not,
justice
souter.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
souter,
i
think
it
is
well-established
that...
though
i
do
agree
that
there's
no
bright
line
between
remedial
mathematics
and
other
math,
but
what
is
critical
is
that
the
federal
title
i
money
was
so
clearly
intended
to
be,
and
the
statute
and
the
regulations
require
it
to
be,
a
supplementation
that
goes
to
the
benefit
of
these
low-income
needy
children
that
i
do
not
think
this
case
raises
the
question
that
would
be
raised
when
taxpayer
funding
takes
over
a
significant
portion
of
the
regular
educational
curriculum.
that
is,
the...
it
is
not
unfamiliar
throughout
federal
law
for
congress
to
have
requirements,
as
title
i
does,
that
the
funds
should
be
used
to
supplement
and
in
no
case
supplant
the
level
of
services
that
would
in
the
absence
of
this
funding
have
been
available.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
as
you
describe
it,
i
believe
that
that
would
cause
a
more
far-reaching
revision
of
the
court's
establishment
clause
jurisprudence
than
anything
we--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--seek
here.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
you
draw
the
line
here
because
this
appropriation
has
none
of
the
indicia
of
congress
providing
the
support
that
then
enables
the
institution
to
engage
in
its
religious
function
more
fully.
for
example,
in
the
case--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
first
of
all,
that
is,
of
course,
as
true
under
the
program
as
it
has
existed
from
1965
to
1997
as
it
is
under
the
issue
that
is
before
is
here.
there's
still
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--there's
the
same
supplementation--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--here,
i
believe
the
attempt
is
not
only
made
but
it
is
fully
successful
to
differentiate
this
program
from
a
program
like
grand
rapids
v.
ball,
which
we
are
not
challenging,
which
we...
in
this
submission
at
all.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
of
course
it
does,
justice
scalia,
as
does--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--right,
and...
in
zobrest
you
approved
that.
it
is
accepted.
you
can
have
school
lunch
programs.
you
can
have
health
programs.
we
have
a
wide
range
of
programs.
zobrest
and
witters
i
think
are
decisions
by
this
court
that
have
clearly--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--you
have
crossed
the
line--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
don't
think
you
have
crossed
that
line
for
this
reason.
if
you
take
a
case
like
grand
rapids
that
has
a
very
different
profile,
where
40
of
the
41
schools
that
were
benefited
were
sectarian
schools,
unlike
the
3
percent
here,
and
where
the
courses
that
were
provided
were
courses
provided
that
were
a
part
of
the
school
curriculum...
in
fact,
they
were
ordered
up
by
the
school.
they
were
much
more
woven
into
the
normal
school
day.
this
is
a
title
i
service
which
is
provided
to
kids,
low-income
educationally
deprived
children
who
need
this
service,
and
what
this
court's
decisions
i
believe
in
zobrest
and
witters
and
bowen
v.
kendrick
reject
is
an
arbitrary,
rigid,
formalistic
notion
that
you
cannot
have
those
services
provided
by
a
public
employee
who
is
hired,
fired,
supervised,
and
paid
by
other
public
employees
inside
the
school
building,
but
instead
you
must
make
children...
and
in
this
case,
70...
a
majority
of
these
kids
are
in
grades
1
to
3.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
seventy
percent
are
nonhigh
school.
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
would
be
glad
to,
justice
ginsburg.
you
are
correct
that
this...
we
do
not
know
of
another
instance
in
which
rule
60(b)
has
been
used
in
this
way,
but
maybe
for
very
good
reasons.
that
is,
the
understandable
reasons
may
be
that
they
are
in
a...
in
a
messy
and
complicated
country
like
ours,
there
are
usually
lots
of
other
cases
that
bubble
up,
other
jurisdictions
that
simply
don't
comply
with
this
court's
holdings,
but
here
the
secretary
of
education
will
not
permit
any
school
district
in
the
united
states
to
provide
these
services
on
premises,
so
that
there
is
for
that
reason
unlikely
to
be
an
issue.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--two
responses.
first
of
all,
as
i
said,
i
think
those
may
well
be
different
than
a
program
of
the
breadth
of
title
i,
but
secondly
there
is
no
suggestion...
there
have
been
a
series
of
cases
where
the
provision
of
these
title
i
services
off-premises
has
been
challenged.
the
courts
have
upheld
against
establishment
clause
challenge
those
cases,
and
those
who
brought
the
case
have
not
sought
certiorari
in
this
court.
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
way
for
a
court
to
modify
one
of
its
own
prior
judgments
that
has
continuing
prospective
effect.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
because
he
believes--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
a
fair
enough
question,
justice
breyer.
i
believe
that
the
office
of
legal
counsel's
proper
response
would
be,
though
we
read
the
law
to
have
changed
since
aguilar,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
secretary
of
education
any
more
than
a
district
court
judge
should
go
directly
in
the
teeth
of
a
decision
of
this
court
which
this
court
has
not
itself
overturned.
in
fact,
i
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
you
are.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes...
no--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
you
approach
that
exactly
as
you
do
a
case
in
which
you're
up
on
a
preliminary
injunction
but
the
question
is
a
rule
of
law,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
abuse
of
power
general
standard,
which
is
a
discretionary
standard
for
the
orderly
administration
of
justice,
cannot
force
this
court
into
making
an
erroneous
decision
of
law
just
because
a
district
court
on
a
preliminary
injunction
or
in
this
context
or
in
any
other
got
it
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
souter,
you...
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy,
you
inform
the
district
judge
as
he
anticipated
in
this
case,
that
the
rule
of
law
he
was
required
to
apply
is
not
what
this
court
believes
is
currently
the
rule
of
law.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
this
is
not...
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
if
he
followed
that
by
ruling
and
not
applying
aguilar
you're
exactly
correct,
and
we
told
the
district
judge
that.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
your
premises
are
correct,
but
the
conclusion
is
wrong,
and
it's
wrong
for
this
reason.
this
would
be
no
different
if
a
new
case
were
brought,
if
there
were
a
new
school
system
that
started
providing
these
services
in
school
and
there
were
a
lawsuit
the
district
court
in
that
case
in
chicago
or
milwaukee
or
wherever
would
be
just
as
bound
by
aguilar
v.
felton
as
the
district
judge
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
and
would
come
up--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
would
not
say
that
this
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
would
not
say
that
this
is
in
effect
a
rehearing,
because
it
is
quite
useful
to
have
the
screening
mechanism
of
district
courts.
here--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
reason
is,
rule
11
sanctions,
if
there's
no
predicate
for
it.
the
reason--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because,
justice
souter,
what
this
permits
is
a
party
who
has
got
a
basis
for
believing
that
an
injunction
which
has
continuing
effect
no
longer
reflects
the
law
or
the
constitution
to
seek
to
have
that
injunction
lifted.
i
think
it
would
raise--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
it
is
critical
to
the
calculus.
it
is
critical
to
the
calculus
because
it
would
raise
a
very
serious
question
about
the
role
of
courts
and
judges
in
a
constitutional
democracy
if
a
party
did
not
have
a
way
to
be
relieved
from
a
court
order.
it
is
of
course--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
question
i
would--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
indeed
the
claim.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
our
point
would
be
for
how
many
years
or
decades
would
you
expect
a
party
to
be
under
an
order
which
would
be
tolerable
if
it
reflects
the
constitution,
but
if
it
just
rests
upon
a
judge's
determination--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
that
is
why--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
why
we
told
the
district
court
to
do
precisely
what
it
did
in
this
case.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
stevens,
the
precise
answer
is
that
the
district
court
followed
the
binding
effect
of
this
court's
decision
in
aguilar,
which
we
believe
no
longer
reflects
the
law
or
the
constitution
as
it
has
been
articulated
by
this
court
in
zobrest,
in
witters,
in
mergens--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
the
question
is?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--and
answer
yes
or
no?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
did
the
district
court
follow
the
law?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
but
the
law
he
followed
was
by
the
binding
force
of
the
court's
decision
in
aguilar
v.
felton,
a
decision
which
we
believe
these
litigants,
who
are
spending...
who
have
spent
$100
million
complying
with
aguilar,
a
decision
that
cost
the
secretary
$300
million
a
year
in
deadweight
social
loss,
that
they
were
entitled
to
come
before
you
and
to
tell
you
that
they...
while
that
is
tolerable
if
it
reflects
the
constitution,
since
there
are
decisions
that
are
out
there
that
indicates
that
it
does
not,
the
question
is
whether
the
popularly
elected
officials
at
the
local,
state,
and
national
level
should
be
bound
merely
because
judges
won't
say
so
where
they
have
a
good
faith
claim.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
precisely
what
would
happen
in
any
suit
brought
to
challenge
aguilar
in
any
case
by
any
litigant
in
this
country.
it
would
be
passed
up
because
aguilar
is
binding
on
every
district,
and
congress...
and
this
court
has
passed--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
and
there
is
a
record
here
which
could
be
supplemented
on
remand,
but
when
rule
60(b)
says
that
you
can
get
relief
where
it
is
no
longer
equitable,
that
such
a
judgment
should
have
prospective
application?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
because
of
this
court's
holding,
but
this
court,
however,
can,
as
it
could
from
any
district
court,
revise
that
ruling.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
line
that
this
court
has
itself
drawn
in
ball
and
in
zobrest
is
that
a
state
may
not
in
effect
subsidize
the
religious
functions
of
the
parochial
schools
by
taking
over
a
substantial
portion
of
their
responsibility
for
teaching
secular
subjects.
justice
breyer,
justice
friendly
was
concerned
about
cases
like
lemon
and
grand
rapids.
here,
there's
no
realistic
danger
of
advancing
religion.
that
was
entangled
as
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem.
justice
o'connor,
your
decision
in
cooter
in
1990
deals
with
abuse
of
discretion.
thank
you.
