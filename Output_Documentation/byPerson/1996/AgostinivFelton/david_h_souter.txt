justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
take
the
position
that
congress,
or
for
that
matter
a
state,
could
simply
appropriate
money
generally
for
the
teaching
of
secular
subjects
and
that
money
could
go
into
the
parochial
schools
without
a
first
amendment
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
do
you
draw
the
line?
you
have
spoken
of
this
as
being
a
supplementation
of
what
is
regularly
done,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
money
is
spent
on
what
are
called
remedial
programs.
in
other
words,
if
a
group
of
children
or
a
child
cannot
read
at
whatever
the
grade
level,
this
money
is
used
to
provide
special
training,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
that
boils
down
to
is
teaching
a
child
to
read,
or
teaching
a
child
who
can't
add
how
to
do
math,
and
i
don't
see
what
the
distinction
is
between
the
supplementation
and
simply
the
school's
normal
mission
to
teach
reading
or
to
teach
math,
or
whatever
the
secular
subject
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
congress
comes
along
and
says
every
school
district
in
the
united
states
that
spends
less
than
x
dollars
per
pupil
will
be
subject
to
supplementation
by
federal
grant
for
the
teaching
of
secular
subjects,
and
this
money
can
go
to
parochial
as
well
as
private
schools.
would
that
fall
under
the
rubric
of
legitimacy
that
you
urge
this
morning?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
would
we
draw
the
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
would
say
this
is
a
supplement
for
poor
school
districts.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
allows
parochial
schools
to
teach
reading
better
than
they
could
teach
it
otherwise
just
as
public
schools
can
teach
reading
better
than
they
could
teach
it
or
are
teaching
it
otherwise,
so
i
don't
see
how
we
draw
the
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
except--
justice
david
h.
souter
--except
that
at
least
an
attempt
is
made
to
draw
a
visual
line,
if
you
will,
between
what
the
school
is
ultimately
accomplishing
and
the
secular
source
by
which
it
is
accomplishing
this
extra
objective.
there's
an
attempt
made
to
avoid
an
appearance
endorsement
kind
of
problem,
and
on
your
scheme
there
wouldn't
be
an
attempt
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
have
we
crossed
the
line,
then,
to
the
point
of
saying
that
any
aid
for
the
teaching
of
a
secular
subject
in
a
parochial
school
is
therefore
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
school
district
could
appeal
the
denial
of
the
order
that
it
wanted,
and
this
court
could
rule
on
it
without,
in
effect,
granting
a
rehearing
on
a
prior
case
in
which
the
judgment
was
final.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
way
the
law--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
the
way
the
law
gets
changed--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
it
may
be
useful,
but
i
don't
see
on
your
principle
why
any
losing
litigant
subject
to
a
continuing
order
cannot
come
in
at
any
subsequent
time
so
long
as
that
order
remains
pending
and
say,
perhaps
for
very
good
reason,
i
would
like
another
shot
at
arguing
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
there
be
a
rule
11
sanction
if
this
is
allowed?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that
so?
why
shouldn't
a
party
have
one
opportunity
to
litigate
the
case
and
if
then
through
some
other
means
the
law
changes,
whether
it
be
a
statutory
change
or
whether
through
other
litigation
this
court
takes
a
different
turn,
then
the
party
can
come
in
and
say,
you
have
changed
the
law
and
therefore
it's
inequitable
to
leave
me
subject
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
general,
your
premise,
the
premise
of
your
argument
was
that
the
law
had
not
changed
and
that's
why
it
was
not
error
for
the
district
court
to
rule
as
it
did.
you're
saying
that
the
law
has
to
change
in
this
case
before
this
court.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
crotty,
we're
still
looking
for
a
limiting
principle.
you
referred
to
the
zobrest
situation.
you
could
say
in
zobrest
that
the
particular
child
either
had
to
get
the
services
in
the
parochial
school
or
the
child
simply
could
not
go
and
learn
in
a
parochial
school
because
there
was
no...
there
could
be
no
communication.
so
that
at
least
is
a
possible
limiting
principle
between,
as
judge...
justice
breyer
was
saying,
the
concerns
that
judge
friendly
raised,
and
the
claim
that
was
being
made
in
zobrest,
and
in
effect
that
was
the
only
way
to
allow
the
child
to
have
the
education.
is
there
any
limiting
principle
here
between
what
you
are
asking
and
a
broader
support
for
secular
education
in
the
schools,
in
the
parochial
schools?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
not
a
constitutional
limitation.
is
there
any
constitutional
principle
that
this
court
could
look
to
to
support
the
position
that
you
are
making?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
geller,
even
assuming
that
were
not
done,
i
have
assumed
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
for
any
school
district,
for
example,
to
protest
the
secretary's
position
and
litigate
that.
there's...
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
myriad
cases
that
could
come
up
here
by
which
aguilar
could
be
reexamined
without
implicating
the
60(b)
problem
if
anybody
wanted
to
take
the
trouble
to
bring
it
up.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
took
the
position
that
zobrest
had
in
fact
undermined
aguilar
to
the
point
that
there
was
nothing
left
of
it,
that
it
had
in
fact
overruled
it,
even
though
we
did
not
say
that
in
express
terms,
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
proper
for
us
to
employ
or
to
sanction
the
employment
of
rule
60(b)
to
grant
the
relief
that
they
want.
do
you
agree?
