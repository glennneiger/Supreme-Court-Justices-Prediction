general
dellinger--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume
that
it
enables
a
parochial
school
to
teach
better
if
you
allow
a
person
who
knows
sign
language
to
enable
its
deaf
students
to
understand
what
is
being
taught
in
a
class
better.
that
enables
a
parochial
school
to
do
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
crossed
that
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
it's
inequitable
to
leave
me
with
only
one
opportunity
to
litigate
the
law
in
my
case.
excuse
me.
i
thought
that
the
claim
here
was
that
the
law
has
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
decision
in
this
case
hasn't
changed,
but
i
thought
the
assertion
is
that
the
law
has
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
these
children's
fault
for
going
to
parochial
school,
i
assume.
they
could
have
gone
to
public
school,
couldn't
they
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
crotty,
justice
breyer
suggests
that
there
is
a
line
between
a
physical
handicap
and
a
mental
handicap,
which
is
what
these
children
are
laboring
under.
do
you
agree
that
you
can
draw
a
line
between
those
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
private
school
students.
i
suppose
you
have
no
problem
with
using
those
public
funds
for
private
school
students
as
well,
so
long
as
they're
not
religiously
affiliated
private
schools.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
no
problem
in
principle
with
making
public
funds
available
to
public
schools
and
to
private
schools.
it's
only
those
private
schools
that
are
religiously
affiliated
that
you
have
an
objection
to,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
no
problem
with
the
free
exercise
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
parents
must
forego
that,
that
subsidy,
even
for
remedial
purposes
if
they
happen
to
select
a
private
school
that
is
a
religious
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see
no
free
exercise
problems
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
geller,
it's
not
a
matter
of
their
having
a
right.
it's
a
matter
of
how
rigidly
one
is
able
to
apply
the
establishment
clause
without
overriding
very
important
values
that
are
contained
in
the
free
exercise
clause,
and
when
you
say
to
people
that
you
must
forego
the
entirety
of
the
educational
subsidy
that
the
state
provides
in
all
forms
if
you
make
a
religious
decision
to
send
a
child
to
a
religious
school,
that
certainly
calls
into
play
the
values
that
are
embodied
in
the
free
exercise
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
adopt
the
absolutist
view
of
the
establishment
clause
that
you're
proposing
simply
ignores
that
aspect
of
the
matter,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
state
can
provide
buses
to
these
parochial
school
students,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
public
services
such
as
fire,
fire
protection
and
so
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
books?
can
you
provide
books
to
parochial
school
students?
you
can
do
that
too,
can't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
doesn't
help
the
mission
either,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
on
zobrest,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
more
than
you
can
on
zobrest.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
there's
not
this
clear
line
you're
trying
to
draw
between
any
assistance
that
the
federal
government
provides
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
mission
of
parochial
schools.
it
seems
to
me
the
line
we've
tried
to
draw
is
between
assisting
them
in
the
accomplishment
of
their
distinctively
religious
mission.
you
just
simply
cannot
maintain
the
point
that
the
state
cannot
or
the
federal
government
cannot
at
all
assist
the
parochial
schools
in
the
accomplishment
of
their
purely
sectarian...
or
secular
educational
mission.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
are
teachers
different
from
books?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
any
easier
to
bug
the
buses
than
it
is
to
bug
the
classrooms?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
to
bug
the
buses
than
it
is
to
bug
the
classrooms?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
you
have
this
problem
about
teachers
inculcating
religious
values,
why
couldn't
it
happen
on
the
bus?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
somehow
the
teacher
magically,
when
she
walks
into
the
public...
into
the
parochial
school
classroom
is
transformed
from
an
impartial
employee
of
the
state,
without
any
secular
interest
in
mind,
to
somebody
who's
going
to
teach
religion.
why
does
that
happen
when
she
goes
from
the
bus
to
the
classroom?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
buses
are
not
even
any
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
district
court
be
able
to
grant
them
that
wish
that
aguilar
no
longer
be
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
mean
in
that
case
could
the
district
court
pronounce
aguilar
to
be
dead?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
assume
it
couldn't
distinguish.
i
mean,
do
you
think
that
district
court...
i
mean,
one
of
the
arguments
here
is
that
look,
this
district
court
under
60(b)
has
no
authority
to
say
aguilar
is
dead.
can
you
conceive
of
any
case
in
which
a
district
court
would
have
the
authority
to
pronounce
aguilar
dead?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
shouldn't,
mr.
geller.
we
have
said
very
clearly
that
we
overrule
our
own
cases.
it's...
and
if
that
is
so,
then
no
matter
how
it
comes
up,
if
aguilar
is
ever
going
to
be
overruled,
we
are
going
to
have
to
say
that
a
district
court
was
wrong
for
doing
the
right
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
it
was
wrong
in
obeying
our
instructions
that
it
should
follow
aguilar.
no
matter
how
it
comes
up,
we're
going
to
have
to
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
court
that
did
the
right
thing
was
wrong,
aren't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
you
not
be
familiar
with
the
gondack
case?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
geller,
can
you
give
me...
i
mean,
it's
fine
that
you
say
some
other
district
may
be
able
to
raise
this
issue.
that's
not
very
comforting
to
new
york,
that's
spending
$10
million
a
year.
is
there
any
way
that
you
think
that
this
particular
entity,
that
new
york
city,
which
is
under,
now,
an
injunction
that
it
thinks
does
not
comport
with
what
this
court
has
said
the
constitution
requires,
is
there
any
way
that
new
york
could
raise
it,
other
than
60(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
imaginative
enough
to
find
some
way
to
provide
relief
to
somebody
who
is
laboring
under
an
injunction
that
is
assumedly
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
obtained,
but
assume,
just
posit--
[laughter]
just
posit
for
present
purposes...
and
the
60(b)
issue
assumes
that.
assume
that
the
law
has
changed,
that
zobrest
now
makes
it
clear
that
the
injunction
was
wrongly
granted.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
no
way
that
we
can
give
relief
to
new
york,
or
to
just
tell
them,
well,
wait
for
somebody
else
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
maybe
you'll
get
lucky?
justice
antonin
scalia
zobrest
applies
to
only
one
individual?
he
has
this
special
privilege?
there's
nobody
else
in
the
country
that
can
get
the
same
kind
of
remedial
assistance?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
say
one
individual.
we
adopted
a
principle
that
would
apply
to
a
lot
of
people.
