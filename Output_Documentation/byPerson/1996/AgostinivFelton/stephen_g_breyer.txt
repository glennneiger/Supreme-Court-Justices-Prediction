stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
curious,
why
can't
the
secretary
of
education
create
a
test
case,
if...
i
mean,
why
couldn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--exactly
what
you
said,
the
laws
change
in
our
opinion
and
therefore
we
think
in
this
partic...
you
know,
deliberately
do
it
in
order
to
raise
the
issue
in
a
different--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
a
change?
i
mean,
what
is
your
response
basically
to
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
fenton?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
on
the
merits?
i
mean,
this
hasn't
been...
the...
i
found
that
a
rather
powerful
argument
on
the
other
side,
judge
friendly's
opinion,
purely
on
the
merits,
leaving
precedent
and
so
forth
out
of
it,
so
if
that's
right
in
the
front
of
your
mind...
if
it's
not,
i'll
ask
more
specifically,
or...
but
is
that
opinion...
are
you
pretty
familiar
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
would
your
response
be
to
judge
friendly
in...
on
the
merits
of
the
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
has
a
number,
four
or
five
reasons
why,
in
terms
of
the
basic
purposes
of
the
establishment
clause,
it
makes
sense,
though
of
course
you'll
get
bizarre
cases.
of
course
it
will
mean
added
expense.
of
course
it's
not
bad
for
a
child
to
be
in
parochial
school.
it's
good.
but
in
terms
of
the
basic
purposes
of
the
establishment
clause,
he
points
out
why
that
line
is
a
helpful
though
sometimes
irrational
line,
so
i'm
interested
in
what
your
response
to
that
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
basically
it
was
along
the
lines
that
justice
souter
was
saying
earlier,
but
i
don't
want
to
characterize
it
if
you're
familiar
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
it's
quite
clear
that
a
handicapped
child,
one
who
is
a
particularly
strong
case
for
breaching
the
line
about
sending
the
public
school
teachers
into
the
schools,
but
then
once
that
line
is
breached,
is
it
then
logical
that
you
could
have
science
taught
for
the
lower
third
in
the
class,
math,
et
cetera?
what
judge
friendly
was
worried
about
was
breaching
a
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason
would
be,
i
suppose
that
the
basic
line
is
as
to
whether
or
not
large
numbers
of
public
school
teachers
are
going
to
be
physically
in
the
parochial
school,
and
we
have
a
whole
list
in
the
opinion
of
problems
that
grow
out
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
this
court's
created
an
exception
to
that,
and
the
exception,
i
take
it,
is
in
the
situation
where
it's
hardest
for
a
child
physically
to
leave
the
school.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
in
your
opinion,
then,
is
the
line?
is
the
line
that
it
is
okay
under
the
establishment
clause
to
send
large
numbers
of
public
school
teachers
into
the
parochial
schools
in
order
to
teach
what?
a
third
of
the
class,
the
lower
third,
any
secular
subject,
all
secular
subjects?
what
in
your
opinion,
is
the
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
finish,
could
you
spend
a
couple
of
minutes
addressing
the
60(b)
question?
that
is,
the
solicitor
general
said,
and
he
certainly
seems
to
me
to
have
a
point,
he
says
there
must
be
a
way
procedurally
to
bring
people
outside
an
injunction
that
requires
them
to
spend
$10
million
a
year
if
the
law
has
undergone
a
sea
change,
or
is
about
to.
they
should
have
some
method
of
testing
it
out.
and
he
then
said
there
is
no
other
way
that
the
secretary
of
education
can't
just
give
money
to
this,
and
i
don't
know,
i
think
of
declaratory
judgment
suits.
i
think
of
the
secretary
possibly
saying,
i
would
give
you
money
if.
i
think
of
some
school
board
who
wanted
to
do
it,
but
is
it
right
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
test
out
this
issue
than
the
60(b)
motion
here,
in
your
opinion?
if
not,
what
is
the
other
way?
