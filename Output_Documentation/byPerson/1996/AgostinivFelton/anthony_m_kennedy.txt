--well,
but
the
focus...
the
focus,
it
seems
to
me,
of
justice
o'connor's
question
is,
what
do
you
tell
the
district
judge...
if
you're
the
law
clerk
for
the
district
judge,
or
the
counselor
to
the
district
judge,
one
of
the
attorneys,
what
do
you
tell
him
he
should
do
in
this
case?
it
seems
a
little
strange
to
say
he
abused
his
discretion
by
following
the
law.
on
the
other
hand,
we
know
that
abuse
of
discretion
is
sometimes
a
too-onerous
word
to
describe
what
the...
phrase
to
describe
what
the
judge
has
done.
he's
made
a
mistake
of
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask...
suppose
that
it
is
very
expensive
and
impractical
for
the
program
involved
to
comply
with
the
establishment
clause.
that
doesn't
mean
that
there's
no
establishment
violation
does
there,
or
does
there?
is
establishment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
question
of
practicality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they'd
go
to
public
school--
--suppose
there
were
a
showing
that
that
alternative
did
not
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
were
a
showing
that
that
alternative
did
not
work?
the
students
have
to
go
there
late,
in
which
case
they
are
not
efficient
at
absorbing
their
lessons,
or
they
have
to
go
there
during
the
midday,
which
disrupts
the
regular
instruction,
and
it's
very
costly.
suppose
it
was
shown
that
this
was
simply
impractical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
of
course
it's
an
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
assumption
is
that
it's
impractical,
and
my
question
is,
what
if
that
assumption
is
true?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
practicality
does
enter
into
our
determination
of
whether
there's
an
establishment
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
true
even
if
that
advances
the
mission
of
the
parochial
school?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
think
busing
students
to
go
to
the
school
advances
the
mission
of
the
school?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
there
in
our
civic
tradition
that
says
that
surveillance
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
citizens
obey
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
there
in
our
civic
tradition
that
says
surveillance
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
citizens
obey
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
geller--
--but
it's
an
odd
calculus,
isn't
it,
mr.
crotty,
that
only
the
person
who's
most...
mr.
geller,
excuse
me.
it's
an
odd
calculus,
isn't
it,
that
only
the
party
most
affected
cannot
get
relief?
