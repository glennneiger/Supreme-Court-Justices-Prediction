mr.
paul
a.
crotty
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
new
york
city
schoolchildren
who
are
poor
and
educationally
disadvantaged
are
not
getting
the
title
1
educational
help
they
need
because
of
aguilar.
many
are
receiving
remedial
education
that
is
less
effective
than
it
could
be,
and
the
expensive
alternatives
mandated
by
aguilar
are
taking
money
that
could
be
used
on
educating
poor,
educationally
disadvantaged
children
and
spending
it
on
buses
and
leased
sites.
in
the
1993-'94
school
year
there
were
260,000
students
who
received
title
i
instruction
in
new
york
city.
this
is
from
a
larger
pool
of
350
to
400,000
who
were
eligible
but
couldn't
get
it
because
funds
weren't
available.
approximately
8
percent,
or
22,000
of
those
title
1
students,
attend
parochial
school.
those
children
received
instruction
either
on
buses
or
with
computer-assisted
instruction.
eleven
thousand
were
educated
on
a
bus.
seventy-five
hundred
received
computer-assisted
instruction.
each
of
these,
according
to
the
secretary
of
education,
is
not
an
effective
method
and
it
makes
it
difficult
to
give
a
quality
education.
if
you
look
at
the
buses,
and
there's
a
picture
of
the
bus
in
the
record,
it's
noisy
because
it
needs
its
own
generating
capacity,
so
you
have
generator
noises.
it's
parked
on
the
city
street
in
new
york
city.
it's
very
noisy.
it's
cramped.
there
are
10
students
and
a
teacher
cramped
into
the
back
of
the
bus.
there
are
small
windows.
the
windows
themselves
are
caged.
there's
no
bathrooms,
and
there's
no
storage
room
in
these
buses,
so
that
the
teacher
does
not
have
access
to
books
and
instructional
materials
which
would
be
very
helpful
with
discharging
the
title
i
teacher's
responsibility.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
well,
no.
in
new
york
city
public
schools,
your
honor,
are
terribly
overcrowded
right
now,
and
i
think
they
would
receive...
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
them
to
receive
an
education
in
public
schools
simply
because
the
public
schools
are
so
crowded.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
their
parents'
absolute
choice
under
this
court's
teaching
that
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
educate
their
children
in
a
parochial
school.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
no--
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
--justice
kennedy,
no,
of
course
not.
the
establishment
clause,
if
it
did
require
these
expenses,
well
then,
we'd
have
to
pay
these
expenses.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
the
issue
here
really
is,
in
light
of
the
court's
change
in,
changing
jurisprudence
with
regard
to
establishment
clause
in
zobrest,
in
witters--
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
--well,
my
answer,
justice
breyer,
is
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
change.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
well,
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that
is
no
longer
the
applicable
law.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
the
answer,
very--
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
--the
answer,
your
honor,
i
believe
is
that
under
the
teaching
not
reflected
in
judge
friendly's
decision,
because
it
occurred
subsequently
and
in
this
court,
in
zobrest,
where
you
had
a
child
who
was
handicapped,
what
the
court
said
was,
when
you
have
a
broad
program
of
benefits
that
are
available
to
everyone,
regardless
of
their
religion,
it
can't
be
denied
to
that
particular
child
because
he
happens
to
be
going
to
a
parochial
school.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
well,
the
line
here,
your
honor,
is,
unlike
in
paroch...
excuse
me...
in
public
schools
under
title
i,
where
they
have
area-wide
schools,
where
enough
of
the
population
is
in
poverty
they
make
the
entire
school
title
i
eligible
and
all
kinds
of
things
happen,
that's
not
available
in
the
parochial
schools.
parochial
schools
only
get
a
very
thin
slice.
they
don't
get
science
courses.
they
don't
get
enhanced
reading
courses.
they
get
remedial
courses,
and
it's
remedial
english,
and
remedial
math,
and
english
as
a
second
language,
and
they're
not
taught...
unlike
the
grand
rapids
situation
or
the
meek
situation,
they
are
not
taught
by
parochial
teachers
being
funded
by
public
funds.
they
are
taught
by
public
school
teachers.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
well,
i
don't
agree
with
that
at
all,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
constitutionally
significant--
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
--well--
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
--well,
it's
hard
for
these
children
to
physically
leave
the
school.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
it's
terribly--
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
--well,
what
i
ask
only,
your
honor,
in
reversing
aguilar
is
that
the
title
i
program
go
forward.
within
the
parochial
schools
it's
not
all
parochial
children
that
receive
this
instruction,
and
even
within
the
parochial
schools
that
get
the
instruction,
it's
not
all
the
children
within
that
particular
parochial
school
which
is
receiving
the
title
i
instruction.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
you
have
a
narrow,
well-defined
program
which
can
be
monitored
to
make
sure
that
the
concerns
that
justice
friendly
had,
judge
friendly
had
are
not
really
applicable...
we've
had
30
years'
experience
on
the
record
of
this
case.
there
hasn't
been
a
single
case,
and
mr.
geller
has
been
litigating
now
for
30
years
on
this
case.
there
is
not
a
single
case
where
he
can
demonstrate
that
a
public
school
teacher
has
had
his
mind
or
her
mind
so
overwhelmed
that
they
began
to
teach
secular...
excuse
me,
sectarian
topics.
so
what
i
would
say,
your
honor,
is
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
jurisprudence,
and
there's
no
facts
that
would
support
the
hypothesized
concerns
that
judge
friendly
had.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
the
same
amount
of
monitoring,
your
honor,
goes
on
in
the
buses
that
would
go
on
in
the
public
schools.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
the...
i
think
the
teachers
are
visited
once
a
month
by
their
supervisors,
and
once
or
twice
a
year,
depending
on
the
teacher's
tenure
status
under
the
collective
bargaining
rules
they
get
an
evaluative
study.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
they're
visited
once
a
month
in
the
bus,
and
then
there's
an
evaluation
study
either
once
or
twice
a
year,
depending
upon
the
union,
the
teacher's
status.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
well--
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
--after
a
full
record
was
made
in
a
preceding
case,
called
the
pearl
i
case,
which
was
a
three-judge
court
case,
and
then
appeal
was
taken
here
to
the
supreme
court,
and
it
was
out
of
time
and
so
it
was
dismissed.
that
record
was
then
incorporated
into
the
aguilar
record.
there's
since
been
a
hearing,
your
honor,
on
related
attack
to
our
compliance
with
the
title
i
program
as
constituted
after
aguilar
as
to
whether
that
violates
the
establishment
clause,
so
there's
been
two
hearings
on
this,
one
in
1978,
and
one
just
recently,
concluded
in
1996.
there
has
been
more
than
an
adequate
opportunity
to
make
this
case
on
the
facts.
it
hasn't
been
made.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
the
limitations,
your
honor,
are
contained
in
the
regulations.
mr.
paul
a.
crotty
i
would
say
that
a
program
that
is
limited
and
made
available
only
to
those
who
objectively
need
it,
without
regard
to
their
religion,
would
be
a
program
that
is
constitutionally
permitted
and
consistent
with
the
court's
teaching
in
zobrest.
thank
you
very
much.
