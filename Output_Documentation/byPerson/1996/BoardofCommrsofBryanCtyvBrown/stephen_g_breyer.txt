who
actually
will
pay
the
judgment
here
if
in
fact
you
win
and
the
judgment
is
only
against
the
sheriff
personally?
i
just
wonder,
in
other
words,
does
your
client
have
an
insurance
policy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
it
in
the
habit
when
there
are
judgments
against
individual
police
officers
or
others
to
pay
those
judgments?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
ever
heard,
if
you've
looked
into
this
generally,
of
cities
or
municipalities
that
don't
have
some
kind
of
policy
or
custom
of
paying
these
judgments
for--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
there
many?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
do
the
plaintiffs
recover
in
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
policemen
independently
wealthy
that
they
can
pay
these
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
how
can
the
policy
of
the
statute
be
vindicated
if,
in
fact,
the
judgments...
the
defendants
are
judgment-proof,
by
and
large?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
monell.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difficulty
that
i'm
having
with
this,
frankly,
is
if
you
take
either
of
those
lines,
what...
it
would
end
up
with
the
cities
being
held
responsible
for
the
actions
of
their
higher
level
employees
even
when
those
higher
level
employees
are
really
going
against
the
preexisting
policy
or
just
making
a
mistake,
or
just
being
negligent
or
grossly
negligent.
what
reason...
and
maybe
they
should
be
held
liable
for
that,
but
how
can
you
hold
them
liable
for
the
higher
action
employees
but
not
the
policeman
who,
after
all,
is
going
out
in
the
course
of
duty
and
also
making
a
mistake,
and
using
too
much
force,
and
breaking
a
door
down
when
he
shouldn't,
and
either
thinking
that
i'm
just
making
a
mistake
or
being
indifferent,
et
cetera.
why
should
it
be
the
one
that
they
have
to
pay
and
not
the
other?
maybe
they
should
pay
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
ask
about
that?
a
minor
factual
question
would
be
helpful.
on
page
114
of
the
appendix
i
take
it
is
the
heart
of
what
the
sheriff
did
that
was
wrong.
he
ran
the
driving
record
down
with
the
oklahoma
police
authorities.
the
oklahoma
police
authorities
gave
him
a
piece
of
paper
called
a
rap
sheet.
if
he'd
looked
at
that
rap
sheet
he
would
have
seen
that
this
individual
did
some
other
bad
things
and
he
never
checked
on
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
but
then...
so
i
thought
what
would
be
relevant,
i'd
like
to
look
at
the
piece
of
paper
that
the
sheriff
had
in
his
hand
so
that
i
could
make
a
judgment,
perhaps,
at
a
great
distance,
about
what
he
should
have
done,
or
what
the
jury
thought
he
should
have
done.
is
that
piece
of
paper
in
the
record?
i
can't
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
well,
your
associate--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
wanted
to
look
at
the
piece
of
paper
that
the
sheriff
looked
at
when
he
supposedly,
in
your
view,
made
a
mistake
of
not
going
further.
