what
instructions
on
causation
were
given
here,
and
what
should
have
been
given,
and
did
the
county
preserve
any
objection?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
perhaps
the
jury
under
these
instructions
could
have
based
liability
on
a
finding
of
just
but-for
causation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
has
this
court
approved
that
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
jefferson,
even
if
there's
a
finding
here
of
deliberate
indifference,
does
that
mean
that
the
jury
does
not
have
to
evaluate
whether
that
single
act
of
deliberate
indifference
caused
the
respondent's
injuries?
i
don't
think
they
were
asked
to
decide
that.
it
was
a
theory
that,
well,
this
employee
was
hired,
and
therefore
there
had
to
be
causation,
because
if
he
hadn't
been
hired,
this
accident
wouldn't
have
occurred,
and
isn't
something
more
required
than
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
there
was
deliberate
indifference
in
a
single
act
of
hiring,
it
seems
to
me
an
act
that
no
law
required
or
prohibited
the
hiring
of
someone
with
misdemeanor
convictions,
and--
--isn't
it
true,
mr.
jefferson,
that
the
jury
specifically
found
that
the
inadequate
hiring
directly
caused
the
plaintiff's
injury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
could.
the
jury
could
have
reached
a
verdict
on
but-for
causation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
was
the
allegation
here,
the
use
of
excessive
force
that
turned
on
that,
and
yet
the
instruction
given
on
deliberate
indifference,
as
i
understand
it,
required
the
jury
to
assess
whether
it
was
so
obvious
that
sheriff
moore's
decision
would
lead
to
violations,
plural,
of
constitutional
rights,
plural.
now,
doesn't
canton
at
least
suggest
that
we
require
a
jury
to
conclude
that
the
violation
of
a
discrete
and
identifiable
right,
here
the
right
to
be
free
from
excessive
force
used,
would
be
obvious
and
here,
how
do
we
know,
under
that
instruction,
that
the
jury
wasn't
just
thinking,
well,
with
that
misdemeanor
record
probably
some
right
would
be
violated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
is
it
focused
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
--be
that
as
it
may,
maybe
that
hadn't
been
thought
through,
or
it
wasn't
pressed
as
a
point.
here,
it
becomes
key,
and
it
seems
to
me
it
left
it
very
open.
i
mean,
you
can
say
in
every
case
that
a
constitutional
deprivation
by
the
officer
who's
hired
wouldn't
have
occurred
if
the
employee
hadn't
been
hired,
and
what
is
there
in
the
instructions
that
makes
clear
that
isn't
the
basis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
these
instructions
nowhere
focused
on
precisely
what
it
was
that
was
going
to
be
the
basis
of
the
liability.
excessive
force,
and
not
leaving
it
plural,
so
that
it
was
open
to
them
to
think
well,
gee,
he
might
be
a
careless
driver.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--perhaps
you
could
have
offered
instructions
that
would
have
clarified
it,
but
under
the
instructions
that
were
given,
i
don't
see
why
it
wasn't
open
to
the
jury
to
base
it
on--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
you're
the
plaintiff.
i
mean,
it's...
you
represented
the
plaintiff,
so
it's
up
to
the
plaintiff
to
offer
appropriate--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why,
in
the
face
of
a
custom
or
usage
in
the
past
of
checking
on
records,
why
should
this
single
deviation
violate
that
statute?
