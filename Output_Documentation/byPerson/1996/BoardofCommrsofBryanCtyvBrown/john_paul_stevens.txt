yes.
so
there
was
a
finding
on
causation
direct--
--in
a
but-for
sense.
but
there's
no...
but-for
is
not
used
in
the
instruction,
is
it?
but
it
could
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
is
your
principal
argument
that
there
was
inadequate
evidence
to
support
the
judgment?
then
we
don't
have
to
wrestle
with
the
question
of
whether
a
single
incident
could
constitute
a
policy,
if
that's
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
could
basically
set
the
judgment
aside
for
inadequate
evidence.
on
the
single
incident
point,
is
it
the
county's
position
that
if
the
sheriff
had
before
him
a
record
that
showed
us
not
just
misdemeanor...
you
of
course
say
that's
a
minor
record,
but
had
a
record
before
him
of
a
series
of
felonies
and
violent
behavior,
and
just
an
extremely
obvious
danger
putting
the
officer
on
the
street,
that
that
still
could
not
constitute
a
basis
for
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
that
the
record
is
so
clear
that
any
competent
sheriff
would
have
recognized
a
serious
danger
to
the
public
by
letting
this
man
be
hired
as
a
police
officer.
that
still
would
not
justify
liability,
as
i
understand
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
held
there
was
no
constitutional
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
assumption
in
this
case
was
that
the
officer
who
had
been
hired
did
commit
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
plaintiff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
my
question
is,
if
it
had
been
as
foreseeable
as
my
hypothetical
suggested,
you
would
still
say
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
wouldn't
be
the
same
as
respondeat
superior,
because
under
respondeat
superior
you
wouldn't
even
have
to
look
at
the
hiring
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
did
respondeat
superior,
but
if
you
look
at
the
hiring
and
say
that
you
looked
at...
that
he
hired
somebody
who
was
obviously
going
to
go
out
and
commit
violent
acts,
that's
another
step
in
the
chain,
that
it
would
not
be
enough...
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
need
to
even
look
at
that
under
respondeat
superior.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
keep--
--no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
hiring
cause
a
constitutional
violation?
that's
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
here
you
admit
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
you
admit
but-for
causation,
but
you
say
it's
not
sufficiently
direct.
