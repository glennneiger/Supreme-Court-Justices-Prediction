justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
jefferson,
could
we
go
back
to
the
question
of
policy,
and
you
have
said
the
county
doesn't
have
a
policy
here,
and
i
guess
more
exactly
the
sheriff
doesn't
have
a
policy
here
of
hiring
unqualified
or
violence-prone
applicants.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
distinguish
between
policy
and
implementation,
or
failure
to
implement
the
policy,
when
the
policy
is
made
by
one
person
or
body
and
it's
being
carried
out
by
another
one.
if
the
county
commissioners
were
setting
this
policy
and
they
said,
investigate
the
applicants
carefully
and
don't
hire
ones
with
criminal
records
indicating
violence,
and
somebody
like
the
sheriff,
for
whatever
reason,
failed
to
follow
it,
we
would
say
one
instance
does
not
convert
that
instance
into
county
policy.
it's
only
when
the
policymakers
know
that
it's
not
being
carried
out
and
they
do
nothing
about
it
that
we
can
say
they
become
deliberately
indifferent
to
it,
and
so
on.
the
trouble
is,
here
we
have
a
different
situation.
the
policy
is
being
made
by
the
sheriff
himself,
and
on
the
one
hand
we'll
assume
that
the
sheriff
has
traditionally
had
a
general
policy
of
investigating
applicants
and
not
hiring
those
with
criminal
records
indicating
violence,
but
we
also
have
to
face
the
fact
that
it
was
the
sheriff
himself
who
said,
in
effect,
i
didn't
even
bother
to
finish
reading
the
criminal
record.
i
didn't
care.
when
the
policymaker
himself
does
not
follow
that
policy,
why
don't
we
judge
the
policymaker
based
on
that
one
instance,
rather
than
saying,
oh,
well,
we'll
wait
and
see
if
he
does
it
several
times
before
we
attribute
a
change
of
policy
to
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it
was
a
deliberate
decision
in
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
a
deliberate
decision
not
to
even
finish
reading
the
criminal
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
we
have
the
option
to
characterize
it
as
negligence?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
the
standard
put
to
the
jury?
did
they
have
to
find
that
there
was
deliberate
indifference,
and
if
they
found
that
there
was,
then
we
can't
call
it
negligence.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
doesn't
that
put
it
in
the
same
class
with--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
the
jury
did
find
deliberate
indifference,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
fact...
we
have
to
take
the
facts
as
they
come
to
us,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
why
we
would
recharacterize
them,
and
if
we
don't
recharacterize
them,
why
aren't
we
in
a
pembaur
situation?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
answer
to
that
clearly
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
whether
he
is
or
whether
he
isn't
depends
on
whether
the
action
is
essentially
a
negligent
action
or
whether
it's
an
intentional
one.
if
i
was
just
careless...
if,
you
know,
the
coffee
was
boiling
over
and
i
forgot
to
come
back
and
finish
reading
the
record
of
the
applicant,
sure,
negligence.
but
if,
in
fact,
i
simply
said
here's
this
record,
i
don't
know
what's
in
it,
i'm
not
even
going
to
bother
to
finish
reading
it,
i
suppose
that's
intentional.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
what
it
turns
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
may
have
been
authorized
by
state
law,
but
there
would
be
a
question
of
whether
it
was
constitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
mean,
we
are...
our
standards
are
not
that
specific,
but
we
do
have
a
standard
of...
which
we've
been
characterizing
as
deliberate
indifference,
and
i
would
suppose
that
it
could
be
found
to
be
within
the
scope
of
deliberate
indifference.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying,
then,
that
one
deliberately
indifferent
act,
even
by
the
policymaker,
is
never
going
to
be
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
would
it
ever
be
enough,
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
were
saying,
all
right,
if
the
policymaker
says,
i
intend,
or
it
is
my
purpose
that
the
constitutional
violation
will
occur,
one
instance
would
be
enough,
but
you're
saying
that
in
deliberate
indifference
cases
it's
not...
i
think
you're
saying
that
in
deliberate
indifference
cases
it's
not
enough,
because
you
can
never
establish
the
direct
causal
connection
by
one
instance
of
deliberate
indifference.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
isn't...
do
i
get
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
like
justice
stevens'
example,
isn't
it,
and
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
was,
no,
that
wouldn't
be
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
his
said
the
felony
record
was
so
bad,
as
he
characterized
it,
that
any
reasonable
person
would
say
that
if
you
put
the
officer
in
a
position
to
use
force,
he's
going
to
misuse
it,
and
you
said
no,
that
still
wouldn't
be
enough,
and
i
don't
see
why
it
should
be
any
difference
if
you
have
a
report
that
the
individual's
a
psychopath.
the
probable
result
is
the
same
in
each
instance.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is...
you
keep
coming
back
to
this
concept
of
unconstitutional
hiring,
and
isn't
the
proper
concept
an
act
which
results
in
or
causes
an
unconstitutional
injury?
well,
it's
a
policy
which
results
in
or
causes,
not
an
act.
well,
act
or
policy,
depending
on
how
we
analyze
it,
but
it's
not
the
hiring
decision
that
is
unconstitutional.
it
is
the
hiring
decision
as
part
of
a
causal
chain
that
results
in
an
unconstitutional
injury,
and
our
question
is,
does
that
hiring
decision...
can
one
hiring
decision,
if
it's
intentional,
qualify
as
the
first
step
in
that
chain,
or
does
it
have
to
be
part
of
a
more
generalized
practice
or
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
the
point
here
is
it's
not
that
you
characterize
step
one
as
being
per
se
unconstitutional.
you
characterize
the
whole
chain
of
events
as
having
an
unconstitutional
result,
isn't
that
fair?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
could
have
a
policy,
i
suppose,
that
i
will
in
fact
hire
ax
murderers,
but
if
i
never
hire
an
ax
murderer,
there
is
an...
if
no
ax
murderers
apply,
and
i
never
hire
one,
there's
never
going
to
be
a
constitutional
injury,
so
we
won't
be
concerned
about
it.
we're
only
concerned
when
the
whole
chain
is
filled
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's
not
this
case,
and
if
this
case
were
decided
against
you
it
would
not
open
any
such
door,
because
this
case
proceeds
not
only
on
the
assumption
that
the
sheriff
is
the
policymaker,
it
proceeds
on
the
assumption,
as
i
understand
the
jury
instructions,
that
he
was
deliberately
indifferent
to
this
kind
of
result
when
he
made
his
hiring
decision.
that
does
not
open
the
door
to
looking
behind
every
particular
act
of
hiring,
no
matter
what
the
governmental
policy
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
submitted
on
a
deliberate
indifference
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
serr,
i
assume
that
you
would
win
this
point
if
we
analyzed
the
case
in
either
of
these
two
ways.
the
first
alternative
is,
we
could
say
that
regardless
of
what
the
announced
policy
is,
if
the
policymaker,
in
this
case
the
sheriff,
intentionally,
consciously,
deliberately
follows
a
different
rule
in
a
given
case,
that
that
is
in
fact
a
change
of
policy,
and
therefore
we
come
within
monell.
or
we
could
say,
even
though
the
stated
policy
remains
the
same,
when
the
policymaker
itself
or
himself
acts
contrary
to
it,
that
is,
in
fact,
the
act
of
the
county--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
the
county
can
act
in
no
other
way,
and
we
don't
require
multiple
instances
because
there's
no
question
of
attributing
this
act
to
the
ultimately...
ultimate
policymaker.
he's
doing
it.
now,
we
could
come
out
your
way
on
this
point
if
we
follow
either
one
of
those
analyses.
does
it
matter
to
you
which
one
we
follow?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
that.
[laughter]
but
how
about
those
two
avenues,
road
a,
road
b.
does
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--road
a
is
that
when
the
policymaker
intentionally
acts
contrary
to
the
stated
policy,
that
action
establishes
a
new
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
still
falls
within--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right.
does
it
matter
whether
we
take
that
analysis
or
the
second
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
does
it
have
any
implications
for
your
case
other
than
winning
or
losing?
in
other
words,
does
it--
--what's
the
second
one
again?
i
forgot
the
second
one
by
now.
[laughter]
