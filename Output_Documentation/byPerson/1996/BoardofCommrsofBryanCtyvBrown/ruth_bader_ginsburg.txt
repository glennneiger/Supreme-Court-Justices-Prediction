mr.
jefferson,
would
you
just
straighten
me
out
on
how
much
money
is
at
stake?
i
thought
that
apart
from
$100,000
the
rest
of
the
award
against
the
county
sticks
because
it's
just
based
on
state
law
negligence?
wasn't
that...
that
the
state
has
consented,
or
the
county
is
liable
for
ordinary
negligence
under
state
law,
no
civil
right
thing.
so
we're
talking
about
only
$100,000
of
the
award.
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
look
at
42(a),
and
the
only
two
items
that
seem
to
be
related
to
the
1983
exclusively
are
(k)
and
(l).
the
jury
answered
yes
to
interrogatory
8
and
9,
do
you
find
that
the
county
was
negligent,
and
the
same
thing
in
interrogatory
9.
there
were
state
law
negligence
claims--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--given
to
the
jury,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
in
the
opening
you
made
a
statement
about
how
much
was
at
stake,
and
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
this
is
plain
old
ordinary
negligence
under
state
law,
and
we're
only
talking
about
part
of
the
award.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jefferson,
you
put
pembaur
in
one
box
because
that
involved
a
direction
by
the
prosecutor,
go
do
it,
so
the
causation
problem
that
justice
o'connor
brought
up
here
didn't
exist
there,
but
you
also
had
in
your
brief
something
about
a
category
of
dangerous
practices,
and
i
was
not
clear
on
what
would
fit
that
category.
it
wasn't
something,
a
direct
command
like
shoot
him,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
is
a
dangerous
practice
that
might
make
the
municipality
liable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
serr,
don't
you
recognize
any
difference
between
a
prosecutor
who
says,
go
seize
that
evidence
illegally,
and
a
city
that
says
we're
going
to
put
guns
in
the
hands
of
police
officers
and
not
train
them
in
its
use--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
this
case,
where
the
record
shows
assault,
but
it
turns
out
to
have
been
an
incident
on
a
college
campus?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
talking
about
that
causation
requirement,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
a
lot
closer
in
canton
than
it
is
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
well,
certainly
in
pembaur.
there
it
was,
go
do
it,
and
in
canton
was
putting
a
dangerous
weapon
in
the
hand
of
an
untrained
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
go
back
to
justice
souter's
question,
because
here
there
is
a
policy
over
a
6,
7
year
period
of
being
careful
about
who
is
hired
to
be
a
police
officer.
that's
the
policy,
and
we
have
one...
does
the
deviation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--from
the
policy
become
in
itself
a
policy?
