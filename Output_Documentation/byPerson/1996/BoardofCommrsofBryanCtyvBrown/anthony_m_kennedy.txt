justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
this
case
that
the
sheriff
made
a
notation
in
the
file,
i
am
hiring
this
man
as
a
matter
of
policy,
will
not
check
background
for
college
offenses.
would
the
case
be
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
even
though
he
says
it's
a
policy,
it's
not
a
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
standard
you
want
us
to
adopt
in
order
to
reach
your
conclusion?
do
you
want
us
to
just
make
a
judgment
on
this
record,
or
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
a
legal
standard
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
suppose
its
an
ax
murderer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
but
i
think--
--no,
but
that's
not
true,
because
in
this
case
it's
been
conceded,
the
case
is
argued
to
us
on
the
assumption
that
the
sheriff
is
the
policymaker.
it's
just
as
if
the
board
of
supervisors
debated
this,
or
whatever
the
governing
board
is
in
oklahoma,
debated
this
entire
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
said
that
after
due
deliberation
we
think
that
this
is
a
good
hire.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then,
you
see,
your
argument
so
far,
as
i
interpret
it,
is
a
strictly
respondeat
superior
argument.
monell
says
respondeat
superior
doesn't
work
when
you're
seeking
to
hold
the
city
liable.
you
must
have
something
other--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--than
respondeat
superior,
and
we're
asking
whether
or
not
you...
and
you
seem
to
disagree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
in
the
hypothetical
that
he
put
you
where
they
hire
the
nephew,
was
that
a
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
if
they...
suppose
they
said,
we're
too
busy
today
and
we're
just
not
going
to
check
the
references,
would
that
be
a
policy?
