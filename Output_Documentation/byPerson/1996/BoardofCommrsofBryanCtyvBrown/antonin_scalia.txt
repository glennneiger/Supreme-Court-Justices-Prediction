mr.
jefferson--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we're
talking
about
policy.
the
word
policy
isn't
in
the
statute,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
just
sort
of
a
shorthand
that
we've
used,
and
maybe
in
a
close
case
we
should
stop
using
it.
the
statute
doesn't
require
a
policy,
it
requires
a
statute,
ordinance,
regulation,
custom,
or
usage.
now,
maybe
a
single
act
may
establish
a
policy,
but
it's
hard
to
see
how
a
single
act
can
establish
a
custom
or
usage.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
person?
suppose
it's
done
just
once.
would
you
acknowledge
that
that
would
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
this
whole
line
of
concession.
i
thought
you
were
basing
your
argument
upon
the
distinction
between
what
happens
once
and
what
is...
what
can
be
called
a
policy,
but
the
extremeness
of
the
negligence,
whether
it's
indifference
or
gross
negligence
or
whatever,
certainly
has
no
bearing
upon
that
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
should
have
to
say,
it
seems
to
me,
that
even
if
he
had
psychiatric
evaluation
that
said
that
this
fellow
was
a
serial
killer,
it...
you
would
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
individual
who
hired,
but
not
against
the
city.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
suggests
that
your
argument
is
contrary
to
our
precedent.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
would
one
person
do?
you
contend
that...
you
maintain
that
failure
to
train
one
person
would
be
enough.
that
is
a
policy.
but
hiring
one
bad
person
is
not
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
a
policy
of
hiring
relatives
without
adequate
background
checks?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
how
it
gets
you
anything,
i
really
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
state
action.
it...
state
action
has
to
be
reflected
in
a
statute,
ordinance,
regulation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--custom,
or
usage.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be
true,
but
was
it
under
color
of
that
statute?
did
that
statute
authorize
hiring
of
unqualified
police
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes,
he
personally
would
have
been
acting
under
color
of
a
statute,
or
of
a
law,
but
when
you
try
to
place
liability
on
the
municipality
for
the
municipality's
failure
to
have
higher
standards
for
the
recruitment
of
police
officers,
you
have
to
refer
to
something
else.
you
have
to
refer
to
some
custom
or
usage,
or
call
it
a
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
there
existed
in
canton
was
a
training
program.
the
opinion
repeatedly
discusses
the
training
program,
and
the
training
program
did
not
include
training
in
this
particular
type
of
skill,
and
that
was
the
issue.
we
don't
have
here
a
hiring
program.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
the
central
difference
in
this
case.
you
have
a
one-shot
hiring
by
somebody
who
does
have
policymaking
authority,
but
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
write
an
opinion
in
this
case
referring
to
the
hiring
program
of
the
municipality.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
insist
on...
if
what
you
say
is
true,
why
insist
on
going
up
to
the
level
of
the
policymaker
anyway,
then?
why
not
just
take
the
individual
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it's
committed
by
somebody
high
enough
up
in
the
municipal
hiring--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
a
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
cheaper
to...
you
know,
to
settle
than
to
litigate.
