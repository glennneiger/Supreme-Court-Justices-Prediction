mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
commissioners
of
bryan
county,
oklahoma,
are
required
by
statute
to
levy
and
collect
nearly
$900,000
in
taxes
to
satisfy
the
judgment
in
this
case.
the
taxpayers
might
reasonably
inquire
how
they
became
liable
to
pay
such
damages
to
the
respondents.
the
answer
cannot
readily
be
found
in
any
decision
of
this
court,
rather
derives
from
an
unprecedented
extension
of
municipal
liability
contained
in
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
says
bryan
county
is
liable
under
section
1983
because
its
sheriff
employed
his
nephew,
who
subsequently
was
held
to
have
used
excessive
force
during
the
course
of
an
investigatory
stop.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
incorrect.
the
judgment
against
the
county
was
for
the
violation
of
civil
rights,
and
in
fact
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
reach
the
question
of
negligence.
that
issues
remain--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--your
honor,
if
you'll
look
at
the
judgment,
the
judgment
that's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert..
the
judgment
itself
awards
damages
jointly
and
severally
against
the
county
and
against
the
officer
for
somewhere
near
800,000.
my
figure
of
$900,000--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--that's
correct.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
they
do
not.
they
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
they
do
not
depend
on
the
amount,
but--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i
appreciate
that,
justice
ginsburg.
what
the
fifth
circuit
found
was
that
because
the
nephew
pleaded
guilty
to
misdemeanor
assault
and
other
misdemeanor
offenses
before
he
was
hired,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
sheriff
was
precluded
from
hiring
him
in
the
first
place.
in
its
2
to
1
opinion,
the
court
then
held
that
the
sheriff's
decision
actually
caused
the
injury
suffered
by
the
respondent
at
the
hands
of
the
nephew.
we
contend
the
fifth
circuit
is
wrong
on
several
fronts.
in
the
first
place,
bryan
county
never
adopted
an
official
policy
of
employing
unqualified
applicants.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes,
your
honor.
the
instructions
are
contained
in
124(a)
through
132(a)
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
instruction
on
causation
was
the
standard
deliberate
indifference
instruction
that
this
court
has
derived
from
canton
and
other
cases.
the
objections
were
clear.
the
objections
were
that
there
is
no
policy
in
this
case
of
hiring
unqualified
applicants,
there
is
no
policy
of
hiring
one
individual
officer,
and
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
case
ought
not
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
we
moved
for
summary
judgment.
we
moved
for
a
directed
verdict.
we
renewed
the
directed
verdict.
we
moved
for
jnov,
or
a
motion
for
judgment
both
before
and
after
the
judgment.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
exactly,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
is
what
they
found.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it
has
not.
it
has
not
approved
that
approach,
and
in
fact
the
causation
has
to
be
much
more
highly
regulated
than
a
but-for
causation
under
canton,
under
tuttle,
under
every
single
case
that
this
court
has
decided
in
the
section
1983
context.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
that's
correct.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that
question.
maybe
even
not
the
first
in
order
of
priority
is,
compare
what
happened
in
this
case
to
what
happened
in
pembaur,
where
again
the
county
prosecutor
there
made
one
decision
and
the
court
held
in
a
plurality
opinion
that
was
enough
to
establish
liability
of
the
county.
that
decision
to
go
in
without
a
warrant
and
arrest--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--it
was
a
deliberate
decision,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
just
like
in
our
case
a
deliberate
decision
to
hire
stacy
burns,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
or
negligence,
a
negligent...
a
negligent
failure--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i
think
we
can
speculate
that
that's
what
it
is.
i
think
the
jury--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--they
had
to
find
that
it
was
deliberate
indifference,
but
the
facts
of
the
case--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--because
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
consistent...
when
you
look
at
the
facts,
they're
as
consistent
with
either
finding
negligence,
failure
to
use
ordinary
care,
or,
your
honors,
even
a
finding
that
he
was
pursuing
his
own
personal
interest
in
hiring...
employing
his
nephew.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
you're
correct,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--and
i'm
offering
the
facts.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
justice
souter,
the
other
answer
to
that
question
is,
in
pembaur
it
was
a
governmental
purpose
that
this
county
prosecutor
was
furthering.
i
think
the
answer
here
is,
we
don't
know
what
the
purpose
was,
and
i
don't
think,
just
because
the
jury
found
that
there
was
deliberate
indifference
here
that
you're...
this
court
is
bound
to
that
opinion,
when...
when
there's--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
think
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor,
and
this
raises...
this
case
raises
the
question
in
pembaur
which
i
don't
think
was
fully
resolved,
and
chief
justice
rehnquist,
you'll
recall
this.
is
it
the
case
that
every
time
someone
who
is
designated
policymaker
makes
a
decision,
no
matter
what
is
is,
that
he's
making
policy
for
the
county?
in
other
words--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
even
if
he
had
read
it--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i
think...
i
think
not,
your
honor,
but
even
if
he
had
read
what
was
in
the
record...
and
this
is
a
very
central
point
here,
and
it's
not
an
easy
one
to
make
based
on
these
facts,
but
i
think
the
analysis
has
to
be
this
way.
even
if
he
had
read
that
record,
he
was
authorized
to
put
this
person
on
the
force
under
the
constitution.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
because
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
or
in
any
opinion
of
this
court
that
i'm
aware
of
that
says
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
hire
somebody
who
has
a
background
of
misdemeanor
arrests.
if...
and/or
conviction.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well,
i
disagree,
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
policy
question
for
the
court.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
there--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--it
did.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
but
that's
the
only
evidence
of
it,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it's
only
a
but-for...
the
evidence
behind
this
jury's
verdict
is
only
in
a
but-for
and
a
vicarious
sense,
that
there's
a
causative
link
of
any
kind
between
the--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i
believe
that
that
is
our
position.
the
evidence
doesn't
support--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i
think
you
have
to
be
very
careful,
your
honor,
when
we're
talking
about
what
is
really
a
negligent
hiring.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it
would
not.
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
to
hire
him,
and
i'll
support
that
with
a
case
that
your
honor
wrote
for
a
unanimous
court,
the
collins
v.
harker
heights
case.
there
was
clear
evidence
there.
it's
under
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
understand
that's
a
different
amendment
that
we're
talking
about,
but
there
was
clear
evidence
there
that
sending
this
person
down
into
the
sewer
was
going
to
result
in
death.
i
mean,
that's
what
the--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
but
you
would
have
to
find
here
that
the
county
violated
the
constitution.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
would
say
no,
and
i
give
as
an
answer,
your
honor,
collins
v.
harker
heights.
in
that,
you
stated
the
due
process
clause
is
not
a
guarantee
against
incorrect
or
ill-advised
personnel
decisions,
and
that's
correct.
i
mean,
there
are
states
that
have
lesser
standards
than
oklahoma's
does,
there
are
states
that
have
more
severe
standards,
but
nothing
about
any
of
those
standards
in
and
of
themselves
shows
that
the
standard
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
had--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i
had
in
mind
something
like
canton,
where
a
dangerous
practice
would
be
putting
people
out
on
the
police
force,
for
example,
with
no
training
in
the
use
of
deadly
weapons.
that
could
be
enough
to
make--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--under
canton,
i
would
acknowledge
it
would,
under
canton,
yes,
for
that
training
sort
of
idea,
but
for
hiring...
for
hiring,
the
court
has
been
clear
for
generations
now
that
there
is
no
respondeat
superior
liability,
and
we're
talking
about
holding
the
county
here
liable
for
a
hiring
decision,
not
just
a
standard,
but
one
particular
decision
that
is
geared
toward
one
particular
person.
i
think
it's
very
critical
to
note
that
the
jury's
question
in
this
case
said,
do
you
find
that
in
the
case
of
stacy
burns,
only
him,
that
there
was
an
inadequate
hiring
by
the
county.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes,
and
strict
liability,
because
there
are
thousands
upon
thousands
of
personnel
decisions
being
made
every
day.
some
of
them
are
not
good
decisions.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well,
that's
what
you'd
be
saying
in
effect,
that
it
doesn't
matter,
you
don't
really
have
to
look
at
the
hiring.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
but
the
first
step
in
the
chain
would
be,
is
the
hiring
itself
unconstitutional.
can
this
court--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
but
if
it
were--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
when
we're
talking
about
causation
and
your...
the
court's
opinions
in
this
area
are
not
crystal
clear
on
this.
deliberate
indifference
is
not
a
standard
in
and
of
itself.
it
has
causation
elements
to
it,
and
you
have
to
show
that
when
the
decision
was
made,
if
it's
hiring
or
training,
that
almost
the
court...
the
county
had
in
mind
that
this
violation
is
going
to
occur.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it
is
not
enough
in
the
context
of
this
case,
because
the
deliberate--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--the--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i'll--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i'll
give
you
an
example--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--no,
no,
no,
you
do
not.
you
do
not,
because
i
do
believe
that
there
would
be
an
extreme
case
which
we
probably
will
never
see
where
one
instance
would
be
enough,
and
that
would
be
where
someone
like
bryan
county
had
a
report
in
front
of
them,
the
psychological
examination...
there's
no
question
of
burns
passed
it
here,
but
had
a
report
in
front
of
them
that
said
this
person
had
a
psychopathic
disorder.
he
has...
he
is
going
to...
by
a
psychiatrist.
he
is
going
to
commit
excessive
force,
criminal
acts.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well,
justice
stevens
was
asking
me
whether
someone
with
a
felony
record.
i
think
that's
a
very
dangerous--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--granted,
your
honor,
if...
there
could
be
a
situation
like
that
that's
extreme.
why
justice
stevens--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--your
honor,
i
agree...
my--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--my
concession
is
based
only
on
your
decision
in
canton,
which
recognized
the
ability--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
examples
of
justice
stevens'
and
justice
souter's
are
almost
never
going
to
happen.
the
example
in
the
footnote
in
canton
about
putting
people
out
on
the
police
force
without
training
them
in
the
use
of
deadly
weapons,
that
is
quite
an
extreme
example,
and
the--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--failure
to
train
one
person
under
canton
is
not
enough
unless
the
link
is
so
direct
that
no
person
could
ever...
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
city
telling
that
one
person
go
out
and
commit
excessive
force.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it
has
no
insurance
policy.
in
fact,
it's
going
to--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--your
honor,
there
is
not
anything
in
the
record,
and
i
cannot
tell
you.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes,
i
believe
there
are.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--sometimes
there
is
no
recovery.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
you
can't
get
around
the
intent
to
vindicate
the
statute
by
holding
a
county
liable
for
something
it
did
not
do,
even
if
the
officer
cannot
pay
the
judgment.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
under
monell.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
that's
correct.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
not
if
it's
not
a
more
generalized
policy
than
that,
than
that
one
case,
no.
we
would
still--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it
would
be
a
closer
case,
and
maybe,
you
know,
perhaps
you
would
get
to
a
jury
on
it,
but
the
evidence
in
this
case
is,
in
every
single
instance,
every
hiring
decision
made
by
this
sheriff,
every
other
time,
adequate
background
investigation.
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
as
well.
there
was
one
deviation
from
this
consistently
good
policy,
and
that
was--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--for
a
relative,
for
hiring
a
nephew,
and
that's
my
point,
your
honor,
that
the
explanation
for
this
hiring
is,
in
my
view,
as
consistent
with
the
fact
that
he
hired
just
to
promote
his
nephew--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
if
it
were
a
policy,
that
would
be
correct,
but
it's
not.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
guess
the
point
on
that,
your
honor,
is,
whether
or
not
it's
an
official
policy,
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
question
for
the
court.
i
don't
think
it's
an
official
policy
because
it's
a
one-time
deviation
from
a
policy
which
could
be
consistent
with
negligence
and
not
established
policy
for
the
county.
the
causation
is
lacking
here
as
a
matter
of
law.
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
there
was
causation
in
this
case,
then
you
look
at
the
statutes
at
the
end
of
the
amicus
brief
for
the
national
league
of
cities,
and
look
at
all
the
statutes
that
allow
hiring
people
with
this
sort
of
record,
those
would
have
to
go
out
the
door,
or
at
least,
if
you
hold
that
way,
then
there's
going
to
be
liability
in
each
and
every
case
for
every
single
hiring
decision.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
think
the
legal
standard,
and
i
would
put
this
for
your
consideration,
is
that
in
a
negligent
hiring
context
the
court
is
going
to
maintain
its
consistent
position
since
monroe
v.
pape
and
beyond
that
there
is
no
liability
for
respondeat
superior,
for
simply
hiring
an
individual.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
if
it's
an
ax
murderer,
that,
even
in
itself...
and
that's
my
distinction,
justice
souter.
it...
an
ax...
it's
not
unconstitutional
to
hire
an
ax
murderer
in
itself.
now,
that's
an
extreme
position.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it
cannot
be
the
starting
point,
unless
you're
to
say--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
no.
the...
because
the
first--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--but
if
your
honor's
correct
then
the
federal
courts
in
every
case
or
controversy
have
the
right
to
look
behind
personnel
standards
that
everyone
agrees
are...
that
states
implement
that
every
one
agrees
are
not
constitutionally
infirm
themselves.
they
can
go
behind
it
in
every
instance.
so
if
your
honor
is
correct
there
that
you
don't
first
look
at
whether
the
hiring
decision
itself
is
constitutional,
then
what
you're
doing
is
saying
federal
courts
are
able
to
intrude
on
an
area
that
has
been,
at
least,
and
even
under
collins,
your
case,
the
prerogative
of
the
state
government.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
agree
with
that
proposition,
your
honor.
the...
but
the
federalism
question
is
still
at
play
because
if
the
court
were
to
rule
in
this
case
to
affirm
the
case,
then
the
question
becomes,
do
all
these
hiring
standards,
these
personnel
standards
that
we
have,
and
all
of
the
states
around
the
country,
and
they're
all
different,
or
many
are
different,
are
they
enough
to
create
a
jury
question
every
single
time?
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
but...
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--and
what
i'm
saying
is,
let's
say
it
was.
let's
say
he
really
had
looked
at
the
record
and
said
i
want
to
hire
him
anyway.
that
is
authorized
by
state
law.
that
hiring
decision
would
be
authorized
by
state
law.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well,
i
believe
it
does,
because
of
the
way
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
it
wasn't
just--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--deliberate
indifference
with
respect
to
one
particular
employee.
