we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1100,
board
of
the
county
commissioners...
the
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1100,
the
board
of
county
commissioners
of
bryan
county
v.
jill
brown.
mr.
jefferson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
your
arguments
here
depend
on
the
amount
of
jury
verdict?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
is
that
if
we
start
saying
that
one
particular
instance
like
this
of
a
deviation
from
a
regular
rule
is
itself
a
policy,
then
you're
back
to
respondeat
superior.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
that
would
be
some
evidence
that
the
policy
they
claim
to
follow
was
not
followed,
but
the
real
policy
was
to
hire
people
regardless
of,
you
know,
any
felony
record.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
was
for
a
relative.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
argu--
--to
say
that
the...
you
have
a
policy
of
unconstitutional
hiring
i
think
is
mistaken.
the
constitutional
violation
is
done
by
the
person
who
actually
inflicts
the
injury
on
the
person
who's
the
plaintiff,
and
the
question
of
whether
you
can
recover
against
the
county
or
not
is
whether
the
county
has
the
policy...
i
don't
think
you
refer
to
the
policy
as
the
policy
of
unconstitutional
hiring.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jefferson.
mr.
serr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
also
decided
in
monell
that
a
municipality
could
not
be
held
liable
unless
there
were
a
policy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
certainly
what
we
said
in
monell.
are
you
questioning
our
decision
in
monell?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
do
you
think
canton
supports
the
proposition
that
deliberate
indifference
is
the
standard
with
respect...
across
the
board,
or
just
with
omissions
by...
it
seemed
to
me
that
canton
was
more
talking
about
omissions
to
do
something
on
the
part
of
the
supervisor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
can
you
supply
it
to
the
clerk
afterwards?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
that
make
it
a
policy,
a
single
departure
for
a
relative?
so
he
simply
wasn't
following
the
policy
in
that
instance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
supervisors
in
this
case,
so
there'd
be
no
question
of
a
single...
what
if
the
supervisors
had
said,
we
always
check
out
the
records
of
people
we're
going
to
hire,
but
in
this
case
it's
the
chairman's
nephew,
so
we're
going
to
depart
in
this
case.
now,
does
that
become
a
policy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
take
your
thinking
far
enough
you're
right
back
to
respondeat
superior.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
if
you're
talking
about
what
you
find
in
the
statute,
where
do
you
find
criminal
recklessness
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
how
the
state
of
mind
of
the
actor
can
make
something
a
policy.
in
other
words,
a
policy
is
a
practice
that's
followed
in
an...
you
know,
thick
and
thin,
that
sort
of
thing.
you
have
a
departure,
and
whether
it's
a
negligent
departure
or
a
deliberately
indifferent
departure,
it's
still...
one
swallow
doesn't
make
a
summer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
serr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
