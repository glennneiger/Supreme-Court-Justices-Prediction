mr.
brian
serr
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
concern
that
this
case
turns
in
but-for...
on
but-for
causation.
that's
simply
not
true.
the--
mr.
brian
serr
--absolutely
not,
because
the
instructions
came
right
out
of
the
canton
case.
the
instructions
required
a
finding
of
direct
cause,
and
in
the
verdict
form
required
a
finding
of
proximate
cause.
this
doesn't
turn
on
but-for
causation.
i
don't
know
how
one
defines
proximate
cause
any
clearer
than
saying
direct
cause.
direct
cause,
closely
related
to,
affirmative
link,
moving
forth,
are
the
terms
that
this
court
has
employed
to
refer
to
the
causation
requirement.
but
canton
specifically
says
closely
related
to.
that's
direct.
that's
direct
causation.
that
is
a
common
way
for
judges
to
refer
to
proximate
cause.
and
moreover,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
evidence
here
was
not
insufficient
to
establish
that
direct
cause,
because
what
we
had
here
was
precisely
the
constitutional
deprivation
that
was
predicted
by
the
red
flags
that
were
up
at
the
time
that
the
county
hired
sheriff
burns.
if...
sorry,
officer
burns.
if
officer
burns
had
gone
out
and
enforced
the
law
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner,
there's
no
causation.
if
officer
burns
had
gone
out
and
committed
a
sexual
assault
of
a
juvenile
detainee,
there's
no
causation.
the
link
between
the
deliberate
indifference
and
the
constitutional
deprivation
just
doesn't
match
up.
but
here,
the
deprivation
that
occurred,
the
excessive
use
of
force,
was
precisely
the
deprivation
that
was
endangered,
that
was
ignored
when
the
sheriff
ignored
the
red
flags
that
were
there
right
at
the
time
of
hiring.
justice
scalia,
i'm
glad
you
referred
to
the
statute,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
word
policy
is...
that
they're
trying
to
use
the
word
policy
against
us,
and
that's
what
i
would
say.
the
word
policy
isn't
in
the
statute.
the
statute
says
every
person
who...
and
a
municipality
can
be
a
person
so
long
as
the
municipality
itself
is
doing
the
acting.
every
person
who
under
color
of
any
statute,
ordinance,
regulation,
custom,
or
usage,
that
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
as
doing
nothing
more,
nothing
less
than
saying
that
the
person
must
act
under
color
of
state
law,
state
action
as
this
court
has
interpreted
in
the
lugar
v.
edmondson
case.
i
don't
know
how
a
sheriff
can
act
for
the
county
and
not
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
brian
serr
the--
mr.
brian
serr
--your
honor,
the
statutes
of
oklahoma
clearly
provide
that
the
sheriff
is
the
final
decisionmaker
on
matters
of
employing
deputies.
they
serve...
in
the
oklahoma
revised
statutes,
chapter
19,
section
547,
those
deputies
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
the
sheriff.
prior
to
1979,
boards
of
county
commissioners
in
oklahoma
had
final
approval
authority
over
deputies.
since
a
1979
change
in
the
law,
that's
not
true.
the
sheriff,
they
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
the
sheriff.
the
sheriff--
mr.
brian
serr
--this
court
has
never
interpreted
section
1983,
as
justice
souter
indicated,
to
require
that
the
action
by
the
municipality
be
facially
unconstitutional.
this
court
has
already
decided
that
in
canton.
mr.
brian
serr
and
this
court
in
pembaur
looked
back
on
monell
and
interpreted
monell
as...
monell
wanted
to
preclude
respondeat
superior.
liability
of
municipalities
must
be
premised
on
acts
of
the
municipality
itself,
not
merely
on
acts
of
subordinate
employees.
pembaur
took
a
very
common
sense
view
of
how
municipal
power
is
exercised.
it's
often
vested
in
individuals
such
as
sheriffs
who
have
final
county
authority
to
make
policy,
to
make
decisions
that
bind
the
county.
the
sheriff
was
the
alter
ego
of
the
county.
the
sheriff
was
the
county
when
acting
in
matters
within
the
sphere
of
his
authority,
and
the
sphere
of
his
authority
clearly
allowed
him
to
make
decisions
as
to
who
can
wear
the
badge
and
who
may
not
wear
the
badge.
mr.
brian
serr
that's
not
what
this
court
said
in
pembaur.
mr.
brian
serr
i
am
not
questioning
your
decision
in
monell.
i
agree--
mr.
brian
serr
--your
honor--
mr.
brian
serr
--no.
your
honor,
subordinate
employees,
a
county
is
not
liable
for
the
acts
of
subordinate
employees
such
as
the
officer
using
the
excessive
force.
pembaur
recognized,
however,
that
official
municipal
power,
the
municipal...
a
county
cannot
literally
pick
itself
up
off
the
map
and
go
out
and
commit
a
constitutional
tort
on
someone.
a
county
can
only
act
through
human
beings.
sometimes
a
county
acts
officially
through
boards,
through
legislative
boards.
sometimes
a
county
acts
officially
through
executive
officers.
the
question
under
monell,
as
this
court
later
explained
in
pembaur,
is,
who
is
doing
the
acting?
is
the
municipality
itself
doing
the
acting,
rather
than
being
held
liable
based
only
on
the
actions
of
some
subordinate
employee
who
doesn't
have
the
authority,
who
doesn't
have
the
power
to
bind
the
county?
the
sheriff
here
was
a
final
policymaker,
an
executive
decisionmaker.
matters
of
hiring
and
training
officers
under
state
law
were
exclusively
within
his
control.
the
county
could
not
act
on
these
matters
other
than
through
the
sheriff.
mr.
brian
serr
when
there's--
mr.
brian
serr
--it
matters
to
me
whether
you
come
out
in
our
favor.
mr.
brian
serr
what
was
road
a
again?
mr.
brian
serr
sure.
we--
mr.
brian
serr
--we
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
brian
serr
we
win
under
either
of
those
analyses.
mr.
brian
serr
other...
under
either
one
of
those
roads,
i
think
we
win
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
that
the
bottom
line
is
whether
liability
is
being
premised
on
the
acts
or
omissions
of
the
municipality
itself.
mr.
brian
serr
well,
for
one
thing,
liability
can
only
be
premised
on
deliberate
indifference.
it's
not
merely
negligence
or
gross
negligence.
deliberate
indifference
is,
as
explained
by
this
court
in
farmer
v.
brannon,
that
is
a
very
high
standard.
that
is
equated
with
criminal
recklessness.
when
the
person
that
is
vested
with
ultimate...
when
the
ultimate
vessel
of
county
power
on
a
particular
matter
makes
an
affirmative,
conscious
exercise
of
that
power,
then
the
county
has
acted.
now,
that
doesn't
open
up
counties
to
broad
form
liability.
that's
the
way
it's
been
done,
really,
since
pembaur,
since
canton.
it's
very
difficult
to
prove
deliberate
indifference.
there
are
very
few
hiring
claims--
mr.
brian
serr
--sure.
mr.
brian
serr
this
court
in
canton
looked
at
the
language
of
section
1983
and
decided
that
section
1983
admits
of
no
distinctions
between
actions
of
the
municipality
that
directly
authorize
or
command
constitutional
violations
or
actions
that
just
are
deliberately
indifferent
and
directly
cause
constitutional
violations.
the
language
of
section
1983
does
not
include
words
like
intent,
or
directly
authorize,
or
command.
canton's
already
done
that.
the
action
does
not
have
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
municipal
action
does
not
have
to
directly
authorize
violations
of
the
constitutional
rights.
the
municipal
action
just
has
to
directly
cause
the
violation,
and--
mr.
brian
serr
--you
mean
in
pembaur?
mr.
brian
serr
okay.
well,
canton
actually
involved
police
officers
that
failed
to
discern
a
severe
emotional
disturbance
in
an
arrestee,
and
the
court
said,
well,
there
was
no
notice
of
any
need...
of
any
obvious
need
to
train
in
that
matter,
but
canton
did
recognize
that
there
are
certain
recurring
situations
that
police
officers
to
a
moral
certainty
will
face,
such
as
decisions
regarding
the
use
of
force,
clear
constitutional
duties
in
recurrent
situations
regarding
the
use
of
force...
do
i
use
force?
how
much
force
do
i
use?
how
do
i
apply
that
force
+/?
such
that
counties
are
inherently
on
notice
that
that
is
the
job
description
of
a
police
officer.
mr.
brian
serr
well,
deliberate--
mr.
brian
serr
--your
honor,
the
deliberate
indifference
instruction
came
right
out
of
the
language
in
the
majority
opinion
in
canton
that
the--
mr.
brian
serr
--well,
that
was
precisely
the
problem
faced
by
this
court
in
canton
with
respect
to
failure-to-train
cases,
that
it
would
be
easy
for
a
plaintiff
to
manufacture
a
situation
of
respondeat
superior:
if
you
had
only
trained
the
officers
in
canton
to
recognize
severe
emotional
disturbance,
this
wouldn't
have
happened.
and
that's
why
the
court
responded
in
canton
in
order
to
eliminate
respondeat
superior
with
the
deliberate
indifferent
standard,
that
the
decisions
by
the
municipality
itself
must
be
so
inadequate
in
light
of
the
specific
duties
assigned
to
officers
as
to
amount
to
deliberate
disregard.
mr.
brian
serr
the
instructions
focused
the
jury
on
the
training
and
the
hiring
of
stacy
burns,
and
the
constitutional
right
that
was
at
issue
here,
as
the
jury
knew,
well
knew,
was
excessive
force,
violations
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
and
the
deliberate
indifference
must,
that's
true,
directly
cause
the
deprivation.
i
can't
imagine
a
case
where
there
is
a
closer
affirmative
link
or
causal
connection
between
the
red
flags
present
at
hiring--
mr.
brian
serr
--and
the
deprivation
that
occurred.
mr.
brian
serr
your
honor,
i
suppose
it's
always
possible
for
the
judge
to
give
more
specific
instructions,
to
spell
it
all
out.
there
was
no
objection
here
by
petitioner's--
mr.
brian
serr
--we
think
these
instructions
do
the
trick
under
canton.
the
judge
looked
at
canton.
we
looked
at
canton.
these
instructions
do
the
trick
under
canton.
mr.
brian
serr
well,
we
would
certainly
assert
that
it
can't
be
more
difficult
to
prove
municipal
liability
for
omissions
than
for
affirmative
exercises
of
municipal
power,
that
if
deliberate
indifference
supports
municipal
liability
for
omissions,
for
failures
to
act
when
the
notice
is
there,
when
the
notice
is
apparent,
that
certainly
that
deliberate
indifference
model
supports
municipal
liability
for
affirmative
exercises
of
official
municipal
power
so
long
as--
mr.
brian
serr
--your
honor,
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
program.
again,
that
i
think
is
taking
a
nonstatutory
term,
policy,
out
of
context
and
interpreting
it
in
such
a
way
that
goes
well
beyond
monell's
rejection
of
respondeat
superior
and
would
result
in
actually
shielding
municipalities
from
fault
when
a
plaintiff
can
demonstrate,
as
plaintiff
did
here,
that
the
fault
clearly
lies
at
the
municipality's
doorstep.
canton
explained...
in
the
very
description
of
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
in
canton
it
says,
in
light
of
the
duties
assigned
to
specific
officers.
there
doesn't
have
to
be
deliberate
indifference
across
the
board.
there's
never
going
to
be
deliberate
indifference
across
the
board.
even
if
a
county
decided
not
to
train
anyone,
some
of
those
officers
are
probably
going
to
have
been
well
trained
by
other
counties.
it--
mr.
brian
serr
--because
in
order
to
avoid
respondeat
superior,
liability
must
flow
from
the
acts
or
omissions
of
the
municipality
itself
and
not
merely
from
the
deprivations
committed
by
the
low-level
employee.
the
single
incident
standing
alone,
the
excessive
force
standing
alone
does
not
by
itself
put
liability
on
the
municipality.
mr.
brian
serr
no.
it
has
to
be
caused
by
official
municipal
action,
which
has
been
defined
in
pembaur.
that
municipal
action
must
be
done
in
deliberate
disregard
to
a
constitutional
deprivation,
canton,
and
there
must
be
a
direct
causal
connection,
again
canton,
between
that
deliberately
indifferent,
official
municipal
exercise
of
power
and
the
constitutional
deprivation
that
in
fact
results,
and
we
have
all
that
here.
mr.
brian
serr
recently.
mr.
brian
serr
recent
bad
things.
mr.
brian
serr
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
brian
serr
actually,
it's
not
in
those
volumes.
mr.
brian
serr
yes.
but
it
was
a
lengthy
record.
it
showed
several
instances
of
assaultive
behavior.
mr.
brian
serr
mm-hmm,
and
we
would
submit
that
that's
also
a
jury
question,
that
the
length
of
that,
how
red
the
red
flag
was...
was
it
just
pink,
or
was
it
real
red?
the
jury
in
this
case
apparently
decided
that
that
was
a
very
red
flag
that
was
highly
predictive
of
this
particular
type
of
deprivation,
the
excessive
force.
you
know,
deliberate
indifference,
farmer
v.
brandon,
that's
criminal
recklessness.
you
don't
have
to
do
much.
once
you
have
notice
of
the
likely,
of
the
high
likelihood
of
a
particular
constitutional
deprivation,
you
don't
have
to
do
much.
you
just
have
to
pay
attention.
you
just
have
to
make
a
little
bit
of
an
effort.
that
effort
can
be
flawed.
it
can
be
a
negligent
effort.
it
can
be
a
grossly
negligent
effort.
you
just
have
to
do
something.
there
was
nothing
done
here.
there
was
no
effort.
the
only
effort
on
hiring
that's
present
in
the
record
is,
we
ran
his
record.
we
got
his
rap
sheet.
but
then
they
didn't
read
it.
mr.
brian
serr
because
the
deviation
was
a
conscious,
deliberate
decision
made
by
the
ultimate
vessel
of
county
authority
on
a
matter
within
his
sphere
of
policymaking--
mr.
brian
serr
--well,
again,
that
goes
back
to
monell
and
what
monell
meant
by
the
use
of
the
word
policy.
that
term,
policy,
in
monell
was
juxtaposed
with
the
rejection
of
respondeat
superior.
that...
when
the
court
rejected
respondeat
superior
they
said,
the
acts
must
be
the
acts
of
the
municipality
itself.
monell
recognized
and
pembaur
recognized
that
municipalities
must
act
through
human
beings,
and
sometimes
those
human
beings
aren't
on
boards
passing
laws
that
take
the
form
of
standard
operating
procedure.
sometimes
those
individuals
who
are
vested
with
the...
the
ultimate
vessels
of
county
power
are
singular
executive
individuals--
mr.
brian
serr
--mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
take
that
line
of
thinking
far
enough,
every
political
subdivision
in
the
country...
counties,
cities,
school
districts...
they
all
get
to
deliberately,
knowingly
hire
one
bad
apple.
mr.
brian
serr
no.
my
thinking
is
that
deliberate
indifference
is
the
key.
criminal
recklessness
is
the
key,
criminal
recklessness
by
the
municipality
itself.
mr.
brian
serr
well,
in
the
canton
case,
and
i
guess
this
traces
back
to
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
kibbe,
there
was
a
concern
by
this
court
about
what
to
do
with
those
policies
that
are
not
facially
unconstitutional,
or
those
policies,
actions
of
a
municipality
that
do
not
directly
authorize
constitutional
deprivation,
the
failure
to
train
cases,
the
bad
hiring
cases,
and
justice
o'connor
articulated
in
her
opinion
in
kibbe
that
the
reason
we
need
a
deliberate
indifference
requirement
is
to
satisfy
that
causation
requirement
in
the
statute.
there
was--
mr.
brian
serr
--absolutely.
as
that
term
has
been
used
by
monell
and
interpreted
by
this
court
in
pembaur,
that
was
a
policy.
mr.
brian
serr
that
would
be
negligence,
perhaps
grossly
negligent.
that
would
not
be
an
actionable
decision
by
the
municipality
under
canton.
canton
requires
criminal
recklessness.
canton
says
that
when
you've
got
deliberate
indifference,
deliberate
disregard
of
constitutional
rights,
then
you
have
a
policy
as
that
term
was
used
by
monell,
so
long
as
that
deliberate
indifference
is
attributable
to
the
county
itself.
mr.
brian
serr
the
majority
in
pembaur
actually
reported
several
dictionary
definitions
of
policy
in
a
footnote,
and
those
dictionary
definitions
of
policy
even
refer
to
a
single
decision.
when
my
dean
goes
out
to
collect
money
from
alums
and
he
has
to
make
a
decision
as
to,
do
we
ask
this
guy
for
a
million
bucks
now
or
do
we
wait
a
few
years
and
ask
him
for
3
million
bucks,
he
refers
to
that
as
a
policy
decision.
i
made
a
policy
decision
to
ask
for
the
million
bucks
now.
mr.
brian
serr
in--
mr.
brian
serr
--the
court
spoke
directly
to
that
in
canton,
that
when
you
have
genuinely
adequate
municipal
decisionmaking,
the
fact
that
one
person
negligently
slips
through
the
cracks
or
accidently
slips
through
the
cracks,
no
problem,
but
if
that
one
person
deliberately,
indifferently,
criminally,
recklessly
slips
through
the
cracks,
then
you've
got
a
problem
under
canton.
rarely
will
the
predictors
be
there.
rarely
will
the
red
flags
be
there
at
the
time
of
hiring.
there
aren't
many
winning
hiring
cases.
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
that,
because
rarely
are
the
red
flags
there
at
the
time
of
hiring
that
are
particularly
predictive
of
the
specific
constitutional
deprivation.
the
only
situations
that
i've
seen
in
the
lower--
mr.
brian
serr
--pardon?
mr.
brian
serr
it's
a
lawsuit.
the
only--
mr.
brian
serr
--sometimes,
your
honor,
the
job
description
and
the
applicant
behavior,
the
preemployment
applicant
behavior
known
to
the
county
decisionmakers
just
doesn't
match
the
job
description.
you
don't
put
child
molesters
in
a
first
grade
classroom.
you
don't
make
them
janitors
at
the
elementary
school.
maybe
groundskeepers
at
the
high
school,
maybe
an
assistant
to
the
tax
collector.
the
same
thing
here.
the
job
description
of
a
police
officer,
as
this
court
recognized
in
canton,
as
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
noted
in
canton,
police
officers
are
expected,
by
the
nature
of
their
job,
to
face
recurring
situations
where
there
are
clear
constitutional
duties
regarding
the
use
of
force.
those
recurring
situations
often
involve
stressful,
tense
confrontations
with
citizens.
that's
the
job
description.
you
don't
hire
individuals...
some
persons
are
unfit.
recent,
lengthy,
lawless
disrespect
for
law
and
order,
immature,
occasional
violent
behavior
is
a
red
flag.
it
is
highly
predictive
of
the
constitutional
deprivation
that
in
fact
occurred.
again,
if
you've
got
a
different
constitutional
deprivation,
enforcing
the
law
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner,
you
don't
have
the
causal
link,
but
we've
got
all
that.
we've
got
the
red
flag.
we...
also,
i
think
the
lack
of
hiring
suits
speaks
well
of
the
municipal
policymakers
in
this
country,
that
normally
when
they
see
that
red
flag
they
don't
hire,
or
if
they
hire,
they
take
some
corrective
measures
subsequent
to
hiring,
but...
and
again,
that's
all
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
requires
of
persons
to
do.
the
federal
district
courts,
justice
scalia,
have
not
been
reluctant
to
grant
summary
judgment
to
counties
if
the
county
comes
up
with
the
least
bit
of
summary
judgment
proof
that
they
made
an
effort,
that
they
paid
attention.
this
record
in
this
case
is
devoid
of
that
paying
attention.
we
ran
his
record,
but
then
we
didn't
read
it,
but
he
had
no
felonies,
as
it
turned
out.
that
was
the
brunt
of
their
case
on
the
hiring.
with
respect
to
the
bad
training,
in
the
face
of
expert
testimony
that
there
was
no
formal
departmental
training,
that
the
training
was
nonexistent
in
the
county,
the
only
thing
they
came
up
with
was,
well,
he
rode
with
grandpa
a
few
times
in
the
squad
car
and
grandpa...
in
the
terms
of...
in
its
testimony,
pointed
out
the
do's
and
don'ts
of
what
to
do,
things
to
look
for
with
the
drunk
drivers,
possible
causes,
possible
reasons
to
pull
people
over,
and
things
of
that
nature.
they
didn't...
the
county
didn't
produce
evidence
of
one
single,
solitary
representative
of
the
county
that
took
stacy
burns,
despite
stacy
burns'
lengthy
preemployment
record
of
behavior
including
violence,
they
didn't
point
to
one
county
official
that
took
him
aside
and
said,
son,
let
me
tell
you
about
the
use
of
force.
you're
going
to
be
facing
situations
where
you
need
to
use
force.
here's
when
you
can,
here's
when
you
can't.
the
record
is
devoid
of
that.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
i
think
there's
a
blatant
misstatement
of
the
record
on
page
5
of
petitioner's
brief
here
claiming
that
calclazier,
which
was
grandpa,
and
howell
gave
burns
general
instructions
on
law
enforcement,
particular
instruction
on
how
to
detect
drunk
drivers,
on
proper
procedures
to
conduct
an
investigatory
stop,
and
on
methods
of
placing
a
suspect
under
the
officer's
custody
and
control.
that
last,
methods
of
placing
a
suspect
under
the
officer's
custody
and
control,
the
transcript
cite,
580,
simply
doesn't
bear
that
out.
no
one
told
him
about
the
use
of
force.
now,
that's
deliberate
indifference,
and
it's
going
to
be
a
rare
case,
a
case
like
ours,
where
you
can
meet
all
those
standards.
this
is...
in
conclusion,
i
think
this
is
a
case
ultimately
about
accountability,
accountability
of
police
officers
on
the
street,
which
is
enforced
largely
through
the
fourth
amendment,
accountability
on
the
part
of
those
ultimate
policymakers
that
decide
who
to
put
on
the
street,
yet
in
a
fourth
amendment
arena,
under
michigan
v.
sitz,
which
is
the
drunk
driving
roadblock
case,
under--
mr.
brian
serr
--thank
you.
