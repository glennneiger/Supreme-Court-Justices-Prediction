mr.
eric
danoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
distinct
legal
issues.
the
first
is
whether
an
injured
maritime
worker
who
has
received
lhwca,
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act
benefits
pursuant
to
an
award
by
an
administrative
law
judge
can
thereafter
seek
seaman's
remedies
or
whether
that
person
is
precluded.
the
second
issue
is
whether
an
injured
maritime
worker's
status
as
a
seaman
or
not
is
dependent
upon
his
job
assignment
at
the
time
when
he
is
injured
or
can
be
dependent
upon
his
prior
work
history
for
other
employers
or
for
the
same
employer.
mr.
eric
danoff
the
case
could
be
decided
on
either
one
of
the
two
questions
in
our
favor
and
that
could
end
the
case.
mr.
eric
danoff
i
think
in
this
case
yes,
and
the
reason
is
that
there
is
a
significant
and
clear
split
in
the
circuits
on
both
issues.
mr.
eric
danoff
i
think
it
would
not
be...
if
the
decision
were
made
on
both
issues,
as
i
think
it
should
be,
it
would
eliminate
the
problems
we
have
raised
in
the
brief
with
duplicative
litigation
in
the
case
of
each
issue,
and
it
would
resolve
the
split
in
the
circuits
in
each
issue.
the
case
could
be
decided
on
narrow
grounds,
but
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
decided
on
narrow
grounds.
mr.
eric
danoff
i--
mr.
eric
danoff
--well,
it's
actually
somewhat
different
fields.
i
think
people
who
are
in
purely
deep
water,
or
seaman
issues,
the
second
issue
would
be
more
important.
to
those
who
are
involved
in
administration
of
lhwca
and
paying
benefits
under
the
lhwca,
the
first
issue
is
more
important.
i
think
they're
equally
important
to
different
segments
of
the
industry,
and
to
some
extent
to
a
group
that
it
overlaps
for,
so
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
resolve
both
issues.
the
preclusion
issue,
the
first
issue
involving
the
benefits
under
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act,
i
wanted
to
underscore
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
gizoni
case
which
was
argued
strenuously
by
the
other
side.
in
the
gizoni
case,
the
worker
who
had
been
injured
had
not
received
any
sort
of
compensation
order,
whether
by
an
administrative
law
judge
or
by
a
section
8(i)
settlement
or
by
the
district
director.
he
was
simply
receiving
benefits
essentially
voluntarily,
at
the
same
time
seeking
seaman
status.
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
that
in
this
case
there
is
a
compensation
order,
and
that
triggers
section
905(a),
which
talks
of...
of
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act,
which
talks
about
the
employer's
liability
is
exclusive
under
the
act,
and
the
issue
is
what
makes
the
employer
liable?
in
the
case
of
the
lhwca,
it's
a
compensation
order,
whether
it's
by
settlement
by
the
administrative
law
judges
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
there--
mr.
eric
danoff
--well,
the
employer
would
not
always
get
protection
if
it
voluntarily
paid,
that's
true.
on
the
other
hand,
from
the
employer's
point
of
view
they
have...
if
they
feel
that
the
jones
act
suit
is
inappropriate,
that
status
needs
to
be
determined,
they
would
have
to
object
because
the
worker
is
seeking
seaman
status
in
the
department
of
labor
forum,
and
at
that
point
get
an
adjudication
of
status.
sooner
or
later
there
has
to
be
an
adjudication
of
status.
it
may
be
some
employer--
mr.
eric
danoff
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
eric
danoff
the
section
to
which
you
refer--
mr.
eric
danoff
--talked
about
not
the
case
we
have
here
where
there's
an
lhwca
finding
of
status
and
then
a
jones
act
case,
but
the
reverse,
and
the...
to
construe--
mr.
eric
danoff
--pursuant
to
the
jones
act
or
state
workers
compensation.
mr.
eric
danoff
as
opposed
to--
mr.
eric
danoff
--to
the
voluntary
payment
of
a
jones
act
settlement
or
to
payments
of
state
workers
compensation.
i
think
it
would
be
very...
a
very
strained
reading
to
take
903(e),
which
doesn't
say
anything
about
exclusive
liability
of
the
employer,
who
has
been
adjudicated
to
have
to
pay
under
the
lhwca,
and
say
903(e)
retracted
that
immunity
without
any
statement
in
903(e)
that
it
is
intending
to
retract
that
immunity
and
without
any
legislative
history--
mr.
eric
danoff
--saying
that.
mr.
eric
danoff
well,
in
gizoni
again
there
was
no
adjudication
yet
of
the
individual's
status
and
therefore
section
905(a)
never
came
into
play.
mr.
eric
danoff
yes.
mr.
eric
danoff
well,
it's
really
in
the
control
of
the
injured
worker.
mr.
eric
danoff
because
he
has
the
right
to
decide
which
forum--
mr.
eric
danoff
--almost.
he
actually
had
the
district
court
judge
try
the
status
first
and
then
went
and
had
status--
mr.
eric
danoff
--well,
it
wasn't
on
appeal.
the
case
had
not
been
concluded
because
he
still
had
a
905(b)
action.
it
was
an
interlocutory
decision.
the
trial
of
the
905(b)
action
had
not
taken
place,
and
was
about
to
take
place
when
the
alj
made
his
decision.
mr.
eric
danoff
that's
really
not
entirely
accurate,
either.
mr.
eric
danoff
i'm
sorry.
mr.
eric
danoff
under
the
longshore
act
the
claimant
doesn't
actually
have
to
file
something.
it's
the
employer's
obligation
to
file
when
an
injury
is
reported,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
eric
danoff
--the
employer
was
voluntarily
paying
and
he
was
receiving
longshore
benefits,
and
then
pursued
the
jones
act
litigation
for
a
status
finding
first.
mr.
eric
danoff
i
don't
mean
to
quibble
with
the
word
invoked.
the
employer
has
the
obligation
to
make
payments
without--
mr.
eric
danoff
--he
chose
to
have
his
status
decided
first
by
the
district
court
in
the
jones
act
case,
and
actually--
mr.
eric
danoff
--yes.
mr.
eric
danoff
yes.
mr.
eric
danoff
yes.
he
wanted
to
have
his
seaman
status
determined
in
the
district
court.
mr.
eric
danoff
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
eric
danoff
no,
he
was
not.
he
could
have
waited--
mr.
eric
danoff
--he
could
have
pursued
the
appeal.
mr.
eric
danoff
yes.
mr.
eric
danoff
that's
right.
mr.
eric
danoff
yes.
as
soon
as
the
905(b)
trial
was
over
he
could
have
appealed
not
only
the
findings
of
that
trial
but
his
status.
mr.
eric
danoff
that's
true.
mr.
eric
danoff
he
was
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
seaman
who
claims
he's
a
seaman.
mr.
eric
danoff
that--
mr.
eric
danoff
--well,
if
the
employer
had
ceased
payments,
then
he
could
have
said
no,
i
am
entitled
to
the
payments,
and
sought
an
adjudication.
mr.
eric
danoff
if
the
employer
controverts
the
duty
to
pay,
he
is
not
obligated--
mr.
eric
danoff
--to
pay
pending
the
adjudication.
there
are
penalties
if
he
is
wrong,
but
yes,
there
could
be
a
period
where
the
worker
is
not
receiving
longshore
benefits,
but
if,
in
fact,
he
is
a
seaman,
that
just
puts
him
in
the
same
position
as
all
other
seamen
and
all
other
tort
victims.
mr.
eric
danoff
i
believe
it
would
be.
i
think
it's
not
you
know,
in
question
necessarily
in
this
case,
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
logic
it
would
be.
mr.
eric
danoff
because
it
was
an
interlocutory
ruling
and
the
first
final
ruling
on
status
is
the
one
that
should
govern.
mr.
eric
danoff
technically
it's
the
latter,
but
if
the
only
issue
is,
are
you
a
seaman
or
are
you
a
longshore
worker,
alj's
will
from
time
to
time
say
we
find
he
is
not
a
longshore
worker
he
is
a
seaman.
mr.
eric
danoff
where
you're
neither?
yes,
definitely.
mr.
eric
danoff
well,
you
could
be
too
inland
to
be--
mr.
eric
danoff
--somebody
has
to
be
a
maritime
worker
and
there's
a
long
and
involved
situs
and
status
determination--
mr.
eric
danoff
--right,
exactly.
those
are
the
three
categories.
mr.
eric
danoff
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cases
every
year
in
which
seaman's
status
is
debated.
this
isn't
even
outside
the
record.
it
was
quoted
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
there
are
many,
many
cases
where
the
status
issue
is
a
very
difficult
issue,
and
where
it
is
litigated,
and
if
this
case
is
allowed
to
stand
will
be
litigated
twice.
mr.
eric
danoff
correct.
mr.
eric
danoff
and
that
will
be
a
question
i'm
sure
some
day
the
court
will
have
to
address.
namely,
when
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the
two
acts
are
mutually
exclusive,
if
somebody
gets
an
award
under
the
jones
act,
for
instance,
first,
is
that
mutually
exclusive
of
the
longshore
act.
in
the
case
of
this
case,
where
the
first
action
is
under
the
longshore
act,
the
statute
itself
says
the
employer's
liability
is
exclusive
in
law
or
at
admiralty.
i
don't
know
what
that
could
mean,
other
than
there's
no
jones
act
remedy
allowed
to
follow.
mr.
eric
danoff
that
may
be--
mr.
eric
danoff
--right.
mr.
eric
danoff
right.
mr.
eric
danoff
the--
mr.
eric
danoff
--that
is
a
possibility
if
there
are
two
pending
proceedings,
that
one
or
the
other
tribunal
would
stay
its
action
pending
the
resolution--
mr.
eric
danoff
--and
some
states,
including
california,
where
some
of
these
cases
are
filed
in
state
court,
the
jones
act
cases
have
rules
of
their
own
which
say
which
action
gets
precedence
first.
the
first
filed
action
often
gets
precedence.
some
states
don't
have
that
rule,
and
then
the
district
court
would
have
to
make
a
discretionary
decision
whether
to
await
the
alj's
finding
or
to
make
its
own
finding,
and
if
the
case
is
over,
then
the
alj
would
be
bound
by
it.
mr.
eric
danoff
at
that...
both
tribunals,
both
the
courts
and
the
alj,
in
the
case
of
hardship,
have
the
procedural
tools
to
make
an
early
status
decision.
the
claimant
should
go
to
whichever
tribunal
he
wants
to
decide
the
issue
and
say,
this
is
a
hardship
case,
i
need
a
quick
decision.
that
issue
can
be
severed...
it's
simply
the
status
question,
not
the
liability
or
the
merits.
it's
often
a
one-day
proceeding...
and
get
an
early
status
decision.
mr.
eric
danoff
but
when
it
was...
of
course,
he
was
receiving
in
this
case
the
compensation
benefits
throughout,
and
when
the
district
judge--
mr.
eric
danoff
--right,
but
that...
actually
the
amount
he
would
have
obtained
is
the
same.
the
back,
the
second
injury,
the
back
injury
had
more
to
do
with
his
final,
total,
permanent
disability
than
his
interim
benefits.
his
interim
benefits
would
be
the
same.
so
he
did
receive
benefits
throughout,
and--
mr.
eric
danoff
--it's
part
of
the
package
that
the
injured
worker
has
under
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act.
he
not
only--
mr.
eric
danoff
--oh,
yes,
and...
it
can
go
forward.
mr.
eric
danoff
it
went
forward
to
the
district
court
to
a
trial.
mr.
eric
danoff
and
there
was
a
trial
of
that
issue.
mr.
eric
danoff
he
had
a
negligence
action--
mr.
eric
danoff
--which
he
pursued
to
conclusion.
the--
mr.
eric
danoff
--i'd
be
happy
to
answer
your
question--
mr.
eric
danoff
--about
the
other
issue.
mr.
eric
danoff
if
he
has--
mr.
eric
danoff
--yes.
if
he
had
a
long-term
assignment--
mr.
eric
danoff
--that
was
a
seaman's
job--
mr.
eric
danoff
--the
fact
that
he
is
doing
something
while
the
ship's
tied
to
the
dock--
mr.
eric
danoff
--no,
it
really--
mr.
eric
danoff
--it
really
is
different,
because
if
each
job
assignment
is
a
different
job
assignment
he
could
be
assigned
one
time
to
a
ship
for
a
voyage
and--
mr.
eric
danoff
--it's
because
the
status
of
an
individual
has...
first
of
all
of
that
individual
has
never
been
by
precedent
judged
by
other
than
his
current
assignment,
whether
it's
with
one
or
more
vessels
or
with
a
single
employer,
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
he
would
make
every
worker
who
was
a
seaman
in
the
past
potentially
a
seaman
now.
the
court--
mr.
eric
danoff
--indeed.
mr.
eric
danoff
indeed.
mr.
eric
danoff
i--
mr.
eric
danoff
--the
chandris
case
had,
i
think,
a
beautiful
example
illustrating
this,
which
is
a
seaman
who
is
transferred
to
the
office.
mr.
eric
danoff
it's
not
his
being
hired
out
of
the
union
hiring
hall
that
makes
a
difference.
that
makes
no
difference.
it's
the
work
for
other
employers,
because
clearly
his
job
will
have
changed.
his
job
assignment
will
have
changed
when
he
changes
employers
and
works
on
different
vessels.
he
has
a
new
job.
mr.
eric
danoff
because
you
need
the
status
of
seaman
to
have
the
seaman
remedy.
mr.
eric
danoff
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
the
question.
mr.
eric
danoff
yes.
the
seaman's
remedies
are
only
allowed
to
people
with
seaman
status.
mr.
eric
danoff
not...
no,
he
would
not
be
in
our--
mr.
eric
danoff
--it's
because
the
relationship
that
has
always
been
considered
determinative
of
status
is
with
the
given
employee,
because
it
has
always
been
considered
that
the
current
job
assignment
governs
in
the
case
of--
mr.
eric
danoff
--because
it
would...
the
seaman
remedies
cover
seamen
in
being,
not
former
seamen
who
are
now
not
seamen.
seamen
remedies
are
limited
to
people
who
are
subject
to
the
perils
of
the
sea,
who
have--
mr.
eric
danoff
--i
don't
think
we
should
unless
it's
part
of
a
continuing
employment.
mr.
eric
danoff
yes.
if
there--
mr.
eric
danoff
--if
there
is
a
long-term
employment,
then
you
can
look
at
the
entirety
of
that
long-term
employment.
mr.
eric
danoff
they
do
pick
up
workers
from
the
hiring
hall
to
do
a
voyage
basis
for
a
specific
timelimited
basis.
it
could
be
1
day,
it
could
be
a
week
on
that
particular
tug.
mr.
eric
danoff
yes.
although
the
job
may
be
more
than
1
day,
yes.
