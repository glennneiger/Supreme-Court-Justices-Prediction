unknown
speaker
mr.
danoff,
as
a
preliminary
question,
if
the
court
were
to
address
the
second
question
and
conclude
that
we
do
not
look
at
the
prior
relationship
with
other
tug
owner
employers
but
confine
the
fleet
principle
to
the
same
owner
of
the
vessels
being
worked
on,
if
we
were
to
do
that,
do
we
have
to
reach
the
first
question,
or
would
that
become
advisory?
i
mean,
what
would
happen
if
we
were
to
decide
the
second
issue
in
your
favor?
unknown
speaker
and
should
it
end
the
case?
i
mean,
do
we
have
any
business
offering
alternative
holdings,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
split
on
both,
but
answering
both
might
make
something
advisory,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
which
of
the
two
is
the
more
important
issue--
unknown
speaker
--to
those
who
are
in
the
field?
unknown
speaker
mr.
danoff,
would
you
explain
to
me...
i
know
you
have
a
literal
interpretation
of
905(a),
but
standing
back
from
that,
you
mentioned
the
gizoni
case.
that
says
the
employer
who
pays
voluntarily
under
the
longshore
act
would
be
amenable
to
a
later
jones
act
case.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
employer
says,
not
a
penny
until
you
drag
me
before
some
forum,
they
go
into
the
workers
compensation,
the
longshore
mold
because
it's
the
fastest,
and
in
that
case
you
would
say
there
can't
be
any
jones
act,
but
in
the
other
case
where
the
employer
was
much
more
solicitous
of
the
employee
there
could
be?
what
sense
would
that
make?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
know,
the
big
problem
as
i
see
it
here
is
that
provision
in
title
33
section
903(e).
now,
i
guess
that's
in
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers
act.
unknown
speaker
and
it
says,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law
any
amounts
paid
to
an
employee
for
the
same
injury,
disability,
or
death
for
which
benefits
are
claimed
under
this
chapter,
the
longshoreman
workers
case,
pursuant
to
the
jones
act,
seaman
act
case,
shall
be
credited
against
any
liability
imposed
by
this
chapter.
now,
this
court
expressed
some
reliance
on
that
section
in
gizoni,
and
presumably
it's
a
section
to
which
we
have
to
give
some
effect,
and
i
don't
know
how
it
would
apply
under
your
proposed
rule.
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
this
section?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
the
reverse.
it
says,
any
amounts
paid
to
an
employee
for
the
same
injury.
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
confine
that
section
only
to
the
voluntary
payment
of
benefits?
unknown
speaker
but
what--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
the
court's
reliance
on
the
section
in
gizoni?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
that
whatever
remedy
is
first
obtained
by
a
final
court
judgment
is
the
one
that
governs?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
race
to
the
courthouse
for
a
judgment
kind
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
based
on--
--here,
the
injured
worker
presumably
went
to
a
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers
administrative
judge
and
asserted
that
he
was
in
fact
a
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers
worker
and
wanted
benefits,
got
that
order,
and
it
was
not
appealed.
it
has
become
final.
but
in
the
interim
the
injured
worker
also
went
to
court
under
the
jones
act
and
said,
contrary
to
the
claim
in
the
longshoreman
administrative
proceeding,
that
he
was
in
fact
a
seaman
and
entitled
to
recover.
is
that
the
situation
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
it
was
on
appeal,
though.
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
say
it's
the
worker's
choice,
this
worker
chose
the
jones
act
route,
and
it
was
only
when
the
district
judge
said,
i'm
sorry
you
don't
fit
under
the
jones
act
that
he
then
went
to
the
workers
compensation
tribunal.
unknown
speaker
well,
which
claim
did
he
file
first?
unknown
speaker
did
he
file
first
in
the
district
court
or
first
before
the
longshore?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
when
did
he
pursue...
when
did
he
pursue
benefits,
in
what
order?
didn't
he
first
pursue
the
jones
act
remedy?
unknown
speaker
and
did
he...
he
did
not
invoke
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act
until
the
district
court
had
ruled
against
him
in
the
jones
act
case.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
it's
the
employee's
choice
which
route
he
wants
to
go,
so
is
it
not
the
case
that
this
employee
chose
the
jones
act
first?
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
was
stuck
because
it
wasn't
a
final
judgment.
he
couldn't
appeal,
and
then
he
asked
for
the
adjudication
under
the
longshore
workers.
isn't
that
just--
unknown
speaker
--a
history
of
the
case--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
not
debatable
that
his
first
choice
was
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
could
have
remained
his
first
choice,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why
could
that
not
have
remained
his
first
choice?
is
there
some...
was
he
under
some
compulsion
to
come
back
under
the
harbor
workers
act
and
ask
for
adjudication
there?
unknown
speaker
he
could
have
pursued
the
appeal.
unknown
speaker
without
pressing
the
harbor
workers
claim,
so
it
was
within
his
power
to
maintain
his
first
choice.
unknown
speaker
he
couldn't
appeal.
he
tried
to
get
a
1292(b)
and
he
was
turned
down
by
the
court
of
appeals,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
he
was
stuck
for
a
long
time.
he
could
have
ultimately
appealed,
though,
if
the
decision
were
adverse
to
him
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
in
the
meantime,
he
has
to
live.
unknown
speaker
could
he
have
found--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
could
he
have
found
himself
in
the
position,
pending
an
appeal
in
the
jones
act
case
in
which
the
employer
ceased
the
voluntary
payments--
unknown
speaker
--and
did
he
hedge
against
that,
was
a
reasonable
hedge
against
that
by
bringing
the
harbor
workers
claim?
unknown
speaker
he--
--but
he
wouldn't
have
gotten
anything
until
the
administrative
adjudication
was
final.
in
other
words,
i
assume
there's
no
provision
in
there
that
the
mere
filing
of
a
claim
under
the
harbor
workers
act
obligates
the
employer
to
start
making
payments
pending
an
ultimate
adjudication
of
liability.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
it
had
gone
the
other
way
before
the
alj...
suppose
the
alj
said,
i
find
this
person's
a
sailor,
would
that
be
issue
preclusive
in
the
district
court
litigation?
unknown
speaker
even
though...
in
this
very
scenario,
where
they
went
to
the
district
court
first,
the
district
court
said,
you're
not
a
sailor,
then
goes
to
the
longshore
route
and
gets
a
determination
there,
you
are
a
sailor,
and
doesn't
contest
that,
comes
back
to
the
district
court
and
says,
see,
now
i've
got
a
final
adjudication
that
i'm
not
entitled
to
longshore
benefits
because
i'm
a
sailor,
and
you
say
the
district
court
then,
despite
the
district
court's
earlier
ruling,
would...
that
it
would
be
issue
preclusive--
unknown
speaker
--do
the
administrative
law
judges
routinely
say,
you
are
a
sailor,
or
do
they
just
say
that
you
are
or
you
are
not
a
longshore
worker?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
could
be
some
instances,
or
could
they,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
where
you're
neither?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
what
the--
--what
are
those?
what
are
those?
i
wasn't
aware
that
there
were--
unknown
speaker
--well,
like
me.
i'm
neither
one,
right?
i
could
bring
a
lawsuit
and
be
found
to
be
neither
one.
[laughter]
it
has
to
be
possible.
unknown
speaker
so
you
mean
somebody
who
might
be
under
state
workers
compensation--
unknown
speaker
--i--
--the
big
problem
comes
up
with
these
people
who
may
be
sailors
and
may
be
longshore
workers.
how
big
is
the
problem?
i
didn't
have
a
sense
of
it.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
danoff,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
the
only
exact
issue
in
the
administrative
proceeding
is
whether
one
is
a
longshore
worker
or
not,
and
you
say,
you
know,
as
a
practical
matter
if
everybody
agrees
there
are
only
two
choices
the
adjudication
is
frequently
made
in
the
form
of
saying,
you're
a
sailor,
but
the
only
issue
that
technically
arises
under
the
act
is
longshore
worker
or
not
longshore
worker.
unknown
speaker
okay.
if
that
is
the
only
thing
that
the
court
is
technically
empowered
to
decide,
if
that
is
the
only
issue
under
that
statute,
then
why
is
there
a
preclusive
effect
if
the
court
goes
the
further
step
and
says
not
only
you're
not
a
longshore
worker,
but
by
the
way,
you
are
a
sailor?
why
should
that
frolic
be
preclusive?
well,
i
guess
this
court
has
addressed
that
very
question,
has
it
not,
in
a
sense,
and
has
said
the
acts
are
intended
to
be
one
or
the
other,
not
both.
yes,
but
there
could
be...
yes,
but
that
means
there
can't
be
both,
but
it's
also
consistent--
--it
could
be
neither.
--with
being
neither,
exactly,
and
the
usual
rules
of
preclusion
i
think
operate
only
with
respect
to
what
is
necessary
for
the
judgment
in
the
first
action,
and
a
determination
that
he
is
a
seaman
as
you
have
explained
it
to
us
is
not
necessary
for
the
judgment
in
the
first
action
and
therefore,
under
the
normal
preclusion
rules,
i
suppose
it
would
not
raise
an
estoppel.
unknown
speaker
well,
justice
souter
is
not
contiadicting
that.
he's
just
saying
that
you're
never
going
to
have
the
assurance
of
only
one
determination
either
under
the
longshoreman
act
or
in
the
district
court,
because
to
be
sure,
if
you
are
found
in
the
first
action
to
be
either
a
seaman
or
a
longshore
worker,
the
other
one
is
precluded
and
the
case
is
over,
but
if
in
the
first
action
you
are
found
not
to
be
a
harbor
worker,
or
not
to
be
a
seaman,
you're
still
going
to
have
a
second
action.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
affect
your
case.
unknown
speaker
once
you're
found
to
be
a
harbor
worker.
but
what
you
have
here
is
an
adjudication
that
this
person
was
in
fact--
--yes.
--a
longshoreman,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
you
prevail
and
we
adopt
the
rule
of
issue
preclusion
where
there
is
a
finding
in
the
agency
as
to
longshore
status,
would
the
district
court
in
a
jones
act
suit
be
correct
in
acting
within
its
discretion
to
defer
proceedings
until
the
administrative
hearings
were
concluded?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
would
say
there
is
a
possibility
that
this
issue
will
be
resolved
conclusively
in
favor
of
longshore
status,
so
i'll
just
wait.
unknown
speaker
i
believe
you
said
that
there
were
provisional
remedies
for
the
employee
who
was
in
this
situation.
this
is
the
employee's
dilemma.
i
want
the
jones
act
because
i
think
i
can
prove
negligence
and
i
want
the
pain
and
suffering,
but
i
certainly
want
something,
and
my
employer
is
not
being
cooperative.
what
does
an...
what
does
someone
do
who's
in
that
dilemma,
who
thinks
he's
got
a
good
jones
act
claim,
but
needs
the
interim
maintenance?
unknown
speaker
but
the
problem
is
that
that's
essentially
what
happened
here
but
then
there
was
no
immediate
appeal
because
he
also
had
the
claim
against
the
employer
as
shipowner.
unknown
speaker
only
for
the
knee.
not
for
the
further
injury,
right?
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
guess
there's
even
a
third
cause
of
action,
is
there,
for
the
employee
against
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
and
that's
not
affected
by
any
of
this
discussion.
unknown
speaker
but
you
agree
that
can
go
forward.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
going
forward?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a...
i
don't
want
to...
i
want
to
ask
a
question
about
the
other
issue,
but
are
you
finished?
is
this
a
good
time?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
if
the...
joe
smith
is
a
carpenter
on
a
boat
tied
up
at
the
dock
and
hurts
himself,
but
this
is
his...
he's
had
10
trips
on
the
same
boat,
ship,
as
a
sailor,
he's
a
sailor,
right?
unknown
speaker
he
just
happened
to
be
hammering
some
nails
and
so
forth.
he's
worked
for,
however,
the
same
employer,
10
trips,
this
is
the
11th
one,
and
i
take
it
we'd
call
him
a
sailor
under
our
cases,
even
though
the
only
thing
that
changed
is
he
happens
to
have
been
hurt
when
he
was
painting,
or--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
now,
in
fact,
the
situation
is
the
same,
except
the
earlier
trips
were
on
different
ships
owned
by
the
same
person.
unknown
speaker
same
result?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
at,
and
i'll
be
more
frank
about
it,
is
if
in
fact
we
have
a
person
who
is
a
sailor
because
he
has
worked
10
times
for
different
ships
of
the
same
company
in
sailing
capacity,
why
does
it
make
any
difference
if
those
10
previous
trips
were
for
different
companies
but
hired
out
of
the
same
union
hiring
hall?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
we
addressed...
the
closest
case
might
be
chandris.
unknown
speaker
where
this
court
acknowledged
with
respect
to
an
employer
a
fleet
doctrine
could
be
applicable,
but
that
was
in
a
situation
where
the
employee's
job
had
not
changed.
in
fact,
dealing
with
an
employee
who
had
been
hired
as
a
seaman
to
go
on
voyages
as
the
chief
engineer
or
the
communications
expert
or
something
and
to
work
in
that
capacity.
did
the
court
acknowledge
that
an
assignment
could
change?
unknown
speaker
and
that
if
the
assignment,
indeed,
changed
and
the
worker
was
then
going
to
just
be
asked
to
come
on
board
to
paint
when
the
vessel
was
tied
to
the
dock
to
do
repairs
on
a
daily
basis,
that
would
be
a
change
of
assignment.
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
were
the
same
employer,
much
less
a
different
one.
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
driving
at...
yes...
is
that
if,
in
fact...
there
are
so
many
variables,
but
hold
them
all
constant,
and
if
he's
a
seaman
because
of
the
fleet
doctrine
should
it
suddenly
make
a
difference
if
everything
else
is
the
same
but
it
isn't
this
employer's
fleet,
it's
the
union
hiring
hall.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
does
the
simple
fact...
if
everything
else
would
make
him
a
seaman
but
for
the
fact
that
he's
hired
out
of
the
union
hiring
hall
and
works
on
the
ships
of
different
employers
in
the
past,
that's
the
only
difference,
why
does
that
make
a
legal
difference?
why
should
it
make
a
legal
difference?
unknown
speaker
then
why
do
we
speak
in
terms
of
status
rather
than
in
terms
of
a
continuing
employment
relationship
as
a
seaman
with
a
given
fleet
employer?
why
does
it
help
to
talk
about
status,
on
your
view,
because
status
apparently
is
something
that
has
no
reference,
can
have
no
reference
except
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
the
employer
and
a
given...
employee
and
a
given
employer?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right.
that's
what
we've
said.
but
why
does
it
make
sense
to
talk
in
terms
of
status?
why
did
it
make
sense
for
congress,
why
does
it
make
sense
for
us,
if
all
we're
really
concerned
with
is
the
duration
or
repetition
of
a
relationship
between
the
worker
and
a
particular
employer?
unknown
speaker
well
hasn't
this
court
said
it's
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
status
of
the
employee?
haven't
we
made
that
the
rule
under
the
statutes,
or
haven't
we
interpreted
the
statutes
as
making
that
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
is
someone
who
is
hired
temporarily
to
go
paint
a
tug
while
it's
at
the
dock
ever
going
to
be
a
seaman
by
virtue
of
that
employ,
no
matter
how
many
days
he
goes
and
paints?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we...
if
he
is
in
fact
acting...
if
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
he
is
in
a
given
case
acting
as
a
seaman,
and
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
his
prior
kinds
of
jobs,
why
do
we
look
to
his
prior
kinds
of
jobs
only
if
they
are
for
a
given
employer
rather
than
his
prior
kinds
of
jobs
for
like
employers
if
our
concern
is
with
status
rather
than
the
details
of
the
employment
relationship
between
a
given
employer
and
a
given
employee?
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
that
make
a
difference
if
status
is
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
then
why
do
we
look...
if
you
carry
your
logic
to
its
extreme,
why
do
we
ever
look
to
a
prior
job
assignment
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
we
did
for
purposes
of
determining
the
substantiality
of
the
satisfaction
of
the
two
criteria
for
seamen
status.
well,
i
suppose
we
did,
did
we,
when
the
person
is
hired
generally
to
be
like
the
engineer
on
whatever
vessel
is
at
sea
by
the
employer,
but
then
one
time
while
the
vessel
was
parked
in
the
harbor
the
employer
said,
by
the
way,
go
paint
the
deck,
and
we
looked
to
the
overall
job
with
the
employer,
i
assume--
unknown
speaker
--to
determine
whether
he
was
a
seaman,
not
just
whether
at
that
moment--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
any
long-term
employment
in
this
setup?
the
solicitor
general
said
that
these...
this
operation
has
no
permanent
crews,
so
it's
not
like
a
vessel
that
goes
off
with
a
crew
and
then...
that
has
a
long-term
relationship.
tell
me,
what
is
the
fact?
is
it
true
that
this
tug
has
no
permanent
crew,
and
that
even
when
it's
at
sea,
these
are
pickup
workers
from
the
hiring
hall?
unknown
speaker
so
all
their
employees
are
picked
from
this
hiring
hall
for
a
per-job,
on
a
per-job
basis.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
danoff.
mr.
boyle,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
that's
simply
a
denial
of
summary
judgment.
that's
not
a
determination
of
fact
by
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
what
order
did
the
district
court
enter,
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
on
the
905(b)?
unknown
speaker
that
simply
means
there's
enough
evidence
to
go
to
trial.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
district
court
is
making
a
factual
finding
one
way
or
the
other.
in
fact,
district
courts
don't
make
factual
findings
on
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
would
the
district
judge
have
to
find
that
he
is
surely
a
seaman
and
probably
has
a
valid
cause
of
action
under
905(b),
or
does
he
only
have
to
determine
that
he
is
at
least
arguably
a
seaman
and
arguably
has
a
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
arguably
a
longshoreman
and
arguably
has--
unknown
speaker
--he
arguably
had
a
905...
it
didn't
say
he
had
a
905(b),
that
he
arguably
did,
which
means
he's
arguably
a
longshoreman.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
it's
given?
who
gives--
--who
gives
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
can't
be
controverted?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boyle,
i'm
not
following
your
argument--
--well--
--because
we
never
got
to
the
905(b)
case
until
the
district
case
first
threw
out
the
jones
act
case.
the
district
judge
did
say,
you're
not
a
sailor.
unknown
speaker
and
then
said,
because
you're
not
a
sailor,
and
that's...
although
it
was
interlocutory
that
was
out
of
the
case,
and
then
they
went
over
to
the
905(b)
case.
unknown
speaker
then
how
do
we
get
the
adjudication
of
benefits
by
the
alj?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
follow--
--are
you
getting
into
this
as
an
alternative
basis
for
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit?
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
plaintiff's
receipt
of
compensation
benefits
under
the
lhwca
precludes
him
from
also
recovering
as
a
seaman
under
the
jones,
but
he
took
it
as
a
given
that
that
had
happened,
and
they
don't
go
into
this
thing
you're
talking
about
at
all.
we
ordinarily
take
the
ninth
circuit's
findings
as
we
receive
them.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
about
the
main
collateral
estoppel
issue,
something
that's
bothering
me
that
i
don't
see
answered.
maybe
there's
an
obvious
answer
to
it.
but
in
your
opinion,
if
the
injured
employee
goes
to
the
longshoreman
people
first
and
they
say
you're
a
longshoreman,
then
the
person
should
be
able
to
sue
under
the
jones
act
and
say,
no,
i'm
a
seaman,
and
that
doesn't
bind
me.
right?
unknown
speaker
okay.
what
happens
in
your
opinion
if
the
first...
if
what
happens
is
that
he
wants
to...
is
the
employer
bound
similarly,
or
not
bound
similarly?
in
other
words,
what
happens
if
they
say
in
the
first
proceeding
you're
not
a
longshoreman,
you're
a
seaman,
and
then
the
injured
person
goes
into
court
and
the
employer
who
just
won
says,
oh,
no,
you're
not
a
seaman,
you're
a
longshoreman,
and
then
the
man
ends
up
with
nothing?
unknown
speaker
because
the
court
says
he's
a
longshoreman
and
the
alj
said
he's
a
seaman,
and
there
he
is,
not
a
penny.
so
how
is
this
supposed
to
work,
or
is
it
possible
that
the
employer
would
be
bound
but
the
employee
wouldn't?
that
doesn't
seem
very
fair.
how
does
this
whole
thing
work
out?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
wouldn't
it
equally
bind
the
employee?
unknown
speaker
will
we
measure
the
vigor
of
the
argument
in
determining
collateral
estoppel?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
i
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
could
just...
what
your
opponent
says
here
is
that
that
could
just
handle
the
situation
in
which
there
has
been
a
jones
act
determination
without
collateral
estoppel
effect,
or
the
situation
in
which
jones
act
damages
are
partly
different
but
not
entirely
different
from
harbor
worker
damages.
unknown
speaker
your
view
is
it's
preclusive
if
the
employer
wins,
but
it's
not
preclusive
if
the
employee
wins?
unknown
speaker
so
then
how
are
we
going
to
deal
with
this
worker,
if
it's
not
preclusive
in
either
case?
you
either
have
to
on
the
one
hand
give
a
system
of
law
where
the
worst
that
would
happen
to
the
worker
is
that
sometimes
he
would
not
get
quite
as
much
money,
or
we
take
your
system,
and
sometimes
workers
will
get
both
with
credit
but
sometimes
they'll
get
nothing,
and
i
have
to
admit
that
that
last
possibility,
which
seems
a
real
one
under
your
system,
is
something
that
i
find
difficult
to
square
with
what
i
think
congress
had
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
also
true,
just
to
throw
this
in,
there
are
situations
in
which
the
plaintiff
will
recover
under
neither
scheme,
because
if
he
is
in
fact
a
seaman
he
can't
recover
as
a
longshoreman,
and
he
may
not
be
able
to
prove
negligence,
in
which
event
he
won't
recover
under
the
jones
act
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he's
neither,
maybe
he's
entitled
to
state
worker's
comp.
unknown
speaker
just
one
point.
if
he's
a
seaman
but
there's
no
negligence,
he
still
gets
something
because
the
vessel
is
unseaworthy?
unknown
speaker
or
maintenance
in
cure?
unknown
speaker
but
he
does
get
that--
unknown
speaker
--as
a
seaman.
unknown
speaker
that's
$22
a
week?
what
about
a
claim
the
vessel's
unseaworthy?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
it
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
because--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
that's
comprised
within
the
jones
act
claim
of
no
negligence?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i'm
asking.
why
doesn't...
justice
stevens
put
to
you
the
case,
isn't
it
possible
that
you
can
be
a
seaman
but
there's
no
negligence.
so
then
i
say,
don't
you
still
have
a
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
say
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
gets
nothing
then
because
he
has
a
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
can't
prove
either
unseaworthiness
or
negligence,
perhaps
he
doesn't
deserve
to
get
anything.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
nothing
to
do
with...
the
longshore...
worker's
compensation
is
a
no
fault...
unseaworthiness
is
still
a
form
of
liability.
you
have
to
prove
the
ship
was
in
an
unseaworthy
state.
it's
not,
i
injured
my
knee
so
i
collect.
unknown
speaker
so...
but
the
usual
tradeoff
isn't
to
show...
the
employer
pays
worker's
compensation
and
then
is
not
at
risk
in
a
tort
suit.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you're
saying
that's
not
what
works
here.
the
employer
was
subject
to
a
compensation
award,
and
then...
but
you
say
what
flows
from
that
doesn't
follow
here.
that
is,
the
employer,
despite
having
paid
compensation,
is
still
at
risk
in
a
negligence
action.
unknown
speaker
and
you
said
there
are
five
reasons
why
he
cannot.
unknown
speaker
and
you've
told
us
one
of
them.
i'm
curious
to
hear
the
other
four.
unknown
speaker
can
it
be
modified
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
longshoreman
status?
unknown
speaker
what
makes
you
believe
so
if
it's
never
happened?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wouldn't
be
entirely
out
of
accord
with
the
whole
purpose
of
these
schemes,
not
just
the
longshore
act
but
also
state
workman's
compensation
schemes.
they
are
intended
to
give
the
employee
assurance
and
promptness
at
the
expense
of
maybe
waiving
greater
damages
that
he
could
have
gotten.
that's--
unknown
speaker
--that's
how
those
schemes
are
set
up.
that's
the
deal.
unknown
speaker
you
get
it
fast,
you
get
it
for
sure,
and
in
exchange
for
that
you're
giving
up
a
shot
at
tort
remedies
that
might
get
you
a
lot
more
bucks.
now,
the
fact
that
this
should
happen
in
the
minicontext
of
this
procedural
dilemma
doesn't
trouble
me
very
much,
because
that's
part
of
the
big
deal
as
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were
certainly
lots
of
workman's
compensation
laws
in
1920,
state
worker's
compensation.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
one
thing,
but
i
thought
you
said
there
weren't
any
workman's
compensation
laws
in
1920.
that
simply
is
factually
inaccurate.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
boyle.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
so
is
it
your--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
your
view...
this
is
the
one
thing
that
is
bothering
me,
the
same
question.
i
mean,
do
you
remember
the
question?
unknown
speaker
no.
well,
the
question
basically
is,
is
your
rule,
is
the
government's
rule
which
says
that
the
proceeding,
first
proceeding
does
not
bind
the
employee
also
applicable
to
the
employer?
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
why--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but--
unknown
speaker
--there
are
a
possibility
of
16
boxes
in
a
matrix,
as
i've
worked
out.
you
can
have
all
kinds
of
permutations
and
combinations.
i
am
confining
myself
for
this
question
to
the
instance
where
the
longshoreman
proceeding
comes
first,
and
here,
one
side
could
win
or
the
other.
the
jones
act
comes
second,
and
i
want
to
be
certain
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
first
proceeding
does
not
bind
the
seaman.
that's
what
you've
argued
in
your
brief...
the
employee.
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
brief.
and
i
take
it
it
is
also
your
position
that
it
does
not
bind
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
for
either
party.
unknown
speaker
you
won't
say
for
either
party,
so
now
i'm
getting
worried.
unknown
speaker
what.
unknown
speaker
it
did
not--
unknown
speaker
--intend
it
on
either
party?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
and
here
i
don't
know,
because
i
thought
collateral
estoppel
was...
i
didn't
know
there
was
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
if
we
called
it
issue
preclusion
there
wouldn't
be
such
confusion,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
took
civil
procedure
years
ago
and
we
just
used
to
say
res
judicata,
and
it
had
two
parts,
and
i
can't
even
remember
it
that
well.
unknown
speaker
then
i'm
not--
[laughter]
all
i
know
is,
if
i
were
an
employer,
i
would
want
to
know...
i'm
an
employee,
and
now
i
was
called
a
longshoreman,
so
now
i
bring
my
case,
and
the
employee...
er
comes
in
and
says,
hey,
this
guy
was
called
a
longshoreman.
that's
the
end
of
this
matter,
and
you
say,
no
it
isn't,
right.
now
i
want
to
know,
the
opposite
happens.
the
person
was
called
a
seaman,
and
the
employer
comes
in
and
says,
hey...
you
understand
the
opposite.
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
i
want
to
know
if
it
reaches
exactly
the
same
result.
unknown
speaker
after
a
year?
can
he
do
it
after
a
year?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
ask
whether
he
can
do
it
within
a
year.
i
asked
if
he
can
do
it
after
a
year.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
not
within
a
year,
he
cannot
do
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
if
he
hasn't
filed
something
within
a
year--
unknown
speaker
--he
must
do
that
within
the
year.
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
has
not
filed
that
paper
within
the
year,
it's
over.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know.
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
it,
though,
i
must
say.
unknown
speaker
it's
automatic?
unknown
speaker
has
discretion
to
do
it
or
not
to
do
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not
automatic.
so
that
is
not
all
he
has
to
do.
he
has
to
do
that
and
get
somebody
to
graciously
give
him
that
extension.
unknown
speaker
let's
be
precise
about
what
his
rights
are
here
and
not--
unknown
speaker
--does
the
opposite
hold
true,
that...
is
it
your
view
that
the
jones
act
suit
is
decided
first?
it
does
have
preclusive
effects
in
the
longshoreman
act
case?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
simply
that
administrative
adjudications
do
not
have
as
heavy
an
issue-preclusive
effect
as
judicial
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
hornbook
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what,
then,
invokes
the
intent
of
congress?
that's...
i
take
it
that's
just
a
general
principle
of
procedure.
you
said...
you
were
arguing
that
congress
had
a
specific
intent
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
congress
just
anticipated
the
normal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
in
which
in
one
direction
there
wouldn't
be
a
preclusion.
that
would
make
sense
of
the
congressional
credit
scheme.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
905(e)
affected...
or
explain
why
it
isn't
the
case,
but
that
interpretation
of
905(e)
effectively
repeals
905(a).
unknown
speaker
the
crediting
provision,
right.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
what
(a)
says.
(a)
says
that
this
liability
under
the
harbor
worker's
act
is
exclusive,
and
you
can't
get
any
other
recovery.
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
confused.
i
know
you're
at
the
end
of
the
time,
but
i've
had
no
opportunity
to
ask
about
it,
to
clarify,
please,
the
point
you
tried
to
address
previously
for
justice
breyer.
apparently
you
think
that
an
employer
could
be
equitably
estopped
for
asserting
contrary
positions
in
one
or
the
other
forum...
fora,
but
the
employee
never
would
be
equitably
estopped
and
can
take
inconsistent
positions.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--can't
that
be
answered
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it's...
doesn't
that
give
you
just
the
opposite
answer
that
i...
i
mean,
i
was
interested
in
the
practicalities
of
this.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
that
there
was
parallel
treatment
here,
and
so
is
it
that
there
is
going
to
be
real
parallel
treatment,
or
that
there
isn't?
i'm
trying
to
think
in
general
terms
about
the
case.
unknown
speaker
but
this
real
live
case
is,
the
employee
says
in
the
district
court,
i
was
a
seaman
when
i
was
injured.
unknown
speaker
and
the
employer
says,
no
you
weren't.
you
were,
if
anything,
a
longshoreman.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
is
voluntary,
after
all.
the
employer
does
not
have
to
pay
under
longshoreman
and
harbor
worker's
act
predetermination
benefits.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
