mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
gizoni
this
court
recognized
the
unique
interplay
between
the
longshore
act
and
the
jones
act.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
the
longshore
act
"clearly
does
not
comprehend
such
a
preclusive
effect.
"
because
it
specifically
provides
that
any
amounts
paid
to
an
employee
for
the
same
injury
under
the
jones
act
"shall
be
credited
against
any
liability
imposed--
"
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--by
the
longshore
act.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
hardship
question.
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
the
longshore
act
proceeding
the
finding
would
not
be
binding.
whether
it--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--is
in
the
jones
act
would
then
be
binding
on
the
longshore
act
is
a
different
question--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--which
would--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
government's
position
is
that
an
alj
determination
in
a
longshore
award
is
not
binding
and
does
not
have
preclusive
effect
on
a
subsequent
jones
act
suit
brought
by
the
employee.
there
are--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--for...
whether--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
answer
to
your
question
is,
did
congress
intend
for
administrative
estoppel
to
apply?
our
position
is
that
congress
did
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
did
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
now,
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
your
question
is,
would
principles
of
equitable
estoppel
apply?
that's
a
different
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
employer,
who
has
not
suffered
detrimental
reliance,
as
this
court
said
in
footnote
5--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
there's
a
difference
between
collateral
estoppel
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--thank
you.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
and
if
i
can--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
same
result,
and
let
me
answer
the
question
about
hardship.
if
the
alj
decides
that
the
worker
is
a
member
of
the
crew,
and
the
district
court
decides
that
the
person
is
not
a
member
of
the
crew,
the
remedy
is
in
922,
which
calls
for
modification
of
awards.
in
that
instance,
the
person
can
go
back
to
the
longshore
proceeding
and
say,
i
was
unfairly
rejected
of
my
longshore
benefits,
and
i
would
like--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--he
can
do
it
within
a
year,
but
he
can
apply--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
within
a
year
he
files
a
notice
with
the
department
of
labor
that
says--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
he...
oh,
yes,
justice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
would
like
to...
justice
scalia,
the
answer
is
all
he
has
to
do
is
file
to
seek
a
stay.
it
would
prolong
the
period
of
limitations.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
justice
scalia,
if--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
all...
if
the
district
court
action
is
proceeding,
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
file
a
notice
with
the
labor
department
to
say,
i
have
this
action
proceeding
in
district
court.
please
don't
make
my
1-year
period
toll.
that's
all
that
he's
got
to
do
to
keep
open
his
modification
of
award.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
district
director
has--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
but
the...
but
this
court's
decisions--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--his
rights
are
to
file
for
a
modification
of
an
award.
that's
clear.
and
that's
also
clear,
justice
scalia,
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
for
these
alj
proceedings
to
have
a
preclusive
effect
on
subsequent
jones
act
suits.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's...
yes,
it
is
likely
that
that
will
be
the
case,
but
not
always,
and
the
reason
is
that
you
would
be
applying
principles
of
judicial
collateral
estoppel
rather
than
administrative
collateral
estoppel.
in
the
most
likely
scenario,
the
district
court
proceeding
under
the
jones
act
will
have
preclusive
effect
because
those
principles
of
judicial
collateral
estoppel
apply.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
right.
there
are
two
principles,
two
provisions
that
we
would
point
to,
the
crediting
provision,
which
makes
clear
that
congress
anticipated
these
parallel
proceedings
would
occur,
and
the
second--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't...
respectfully,
i
think,
justice
souter,
the
way
the
credit
provision
is
worded
by
saying
liability
imposed,
if
you
accepted
petitioner's
position,
there
would
be
no
point
in
having
the
crediting
provision,
because
the
first
tribunal
to
decide
it
would
have
preclusive
effect.
there
wouldn't
be
nothing...
there
would
be
nothing
to
credit.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
justice
scalia.
903(e),
the
crediting
provision--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--is...
simply
says
905(a)
means
exclusivity
means
no
double
recovery
in
the
jones
act
suit.
with
respect
to
state
tort
remedies,
exclusivity--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--as
this
court
pointed
out
in
footnote
3
of
gizoni,
that
means
if
the
person
is
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
it
doesn't
say
who
decides
that,
and
our
position
is
that
the
district
court
jury
in
the
jones
act
suit
would
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
whether
the
worker
is
a
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
question
is
one--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
it
can,
and
the
answer
is
yes
because
of
detrimental
reliance.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
let
me...
maybe
if
i'm
concrete
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
answer.
if
this
were
brought
in
district
court
where
the
worker
said,
count
1,
i'm
a
jones
act
seaman,
or
count
2,
i'm
a
longshore
worker,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem.
the
jury
could
decide
what
the
status
is.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
what
has
happened
here,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
instead
of
paying
maintenance
and
cure,
which
under
the
boatman's
agreement
for
deck
hands
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
here
did
not
pay
maintenance
and
cure,
which
would
be
the
traditional
seaman's
remedy,
and
now
under
petitioner's
theory
would
have
the
leverage
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
you
voluntary
benefits
under
the
longshore
act
either,
and
so
the
question
of
hardship
really
does
arise
for
the
injured
worker.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
may
i
answer
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
our
position
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
injured
maritime
workers
to
be
left
without
any
interim
remedy
while
they
pursued
the
status
to
which
they
are
justly...
should
be
awarded.
