mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
was
stated
previously,
this
court
has
already
held
that
voluntary
payment
of
longshore
benefits
does
not
preclude
a
jones
act
award.
neither
should
it...
neither
should
the
formal
award
that
was
made
in
this
case
preclude
this
jones
act
suit.
before
i
get
into
that,
though,
one
thing
i
have
to
make
clear
is
that
this
scenario
never
occurs
except
in
one
very,
very
specific
instance.
that's
when
the
employer
owns
the
ship.
the
employer
must
own
the
ship
to
have
this
problem.
and
when
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
made
as
against
the
jones
act
complaint
here,
defendant
also...
petitioner
also
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
this
plaintiff
did
not
have
a
905(b)
action
for
negligence,
and
when
the
judge
decided
there
was
no
jones
act
case,
the
judge
also
decided
that
there
was
a
905(b)
case,
thereby
deciding
that
this
man
was
a
longshoreman,
so
the
judge,
the
district
judge
decided
that
this
man
was
in
the
longshore
act
before
he
ever
went
over
to
the
alj.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
your
honor,
the
district
judge
determined
that
because
of
the
circumstance
of
this
man's
employment
he
could
proceed
with
a
905(b)
action.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
a
partial...
a
partial
denial
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
no.
but
your
honor,
in
order
to
even
maintain
a
905(b)
action
one
has
to
be
a
longshoreman.
one
may
not
be
a
seaman.
because
the
longshore
act
provides
a
lien
as
against
the
905(b)
action,
and
that
was
already
determined
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
determined
by
the
alj.
the
alj
mistakenly
redetermined
it.
the
district
judge
had
already
determined
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
you
mean
arguably
a
longshoreman.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
i
think
the
court...
the
case
is
dismissable.
defendant...
petitioner
argued
that
the
man
had
no
905(b)
action
along
with
no
jones
act
cause
of
action,
and
the
judge
decided
that
in
view
of
the
circumstances
that
he
was
a
longshoreman
within
the
longshore
act--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--your
honor,
there
is
no
determination
by
the
finder
of
fact
that
a
905(b)
action
as
to
whether
or
not
the
worker
is
a
longshoreman
is
given
that
he
is
a
longshoreman.
no
finder
of
fact
decides
longshore
status
in
a
905(b)
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
it's
just
like...
it's
in
the
nature
of
in
a
diversity
action
you
allege
that
you're
a
citizen
of
state
a,
and
you
allege
defendant
is
a
citizen
of
state
b.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
yes,
it
can,
and
the
defendant
did
controvert
it
in
this
case.
they
said--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
and
as
part
of
the
905(b)
case
went
to
the
alj
at
the
department
of
labor
to
get
the
lien
established.
that's
why
he
went
to
the
department
of
labor,
not
to
get
benefits
but
to
get
the
lien
established.
it
was
part
of
the
905(b)
process.
it
was
a
ticket
to
be
punched
in
the
905(b)
action.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
because
the
alj
didn't
recognize
that
he
was
already
precluded
from
making
another
determination
about
status
by
virtue
of
the
district
judge's
decision
and
undertook
to
make
a
new
determination,
and
then
made
a
new
determination,
which
he
should
not
have
made.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
only
reason
i
got
into
this
is
because
there
was
a
lot
of
colloquy
during
mr.
danoff's
argument
about
people
being
seamen,
being
longshoreman,
and
being
neither,
and
that's
the
only
reason
why
i
brought
this
up.
that's
all.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--well,
the
way
it
works
out
is
that
if
the
employer
went
before...
in
front
of
the
alj
and
vigorously
argued
that
the
worker
was
a
seaman,
regardless
of
what
the
alj
decided,
the
arguments,
the
conduct
advanced
by
that
litigant
in
front
of
the
alj,
principles
of
equitable
estoppel
would
prevent
the
employer
from
going
in
front
of
the
district
judge
and
taking
an
opposite
position.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
because
in
this
case
and
in
all
of
these
cases
you
never
have
an
employee
go
in
and
vigorously
argue
that
they're
a
longshoreman.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
to
the
extent
that
one
of
the
guidelines
of
the
astoria
savings
case
versus
solimino
is
the
incentive
to
vigorously
or
aggressively
pursue
a
position.
now,
there
are
five
things
about
this
alj
determination
and
alj
awards
of
longshore
benefits
that
indicate
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
administrative
collateral
estoppel,
and
the
first
of
those
was
mentioned
in
mr.
danoff's
argument,
is
in
the
statute
itself,
the
longshore
statute,
903(e)
that
talks
about
credit
for
jones
act
payments
in
making
longshore
awards.
if
it
goes
in
that
direction
one
way,
it
should
go
the
other
direction
also.
the
second
one
is
913(c).
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
in
this
court's
opinion
in
gizoni,
on
502
u.s.
page
91,
the
court
stated
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
receipt
of
longshore
benefits
should
not
preclude
pursuit
of
jones
act
benefits
was
that
section
903(e)
of
the
longshore
act
says
that
any
payments
by
reason...
payments
made
under
the
jones
act
would
be
a
credit
to
any
liability
imposed
upon
the
employer
under
the
longshore
act,
and
in
a
footnote
in
that
opinion
it
was
mentioned
that
because
of
that
there
is
no
detrimental
reliance
upon
any
position
that
the
employee
takes
because
the
employer
gets
credit
for
having
paid
moneys
out
under
the
jones
act.
that
being
the
situation,
then
the
opposite
of
that
should
also
be
true,
and
it
is
true
that
the
employer
gets
credit
for
any
moneys
paid
under
the
longshore
act
in
the
pursuit
of
a
jones
act
remedy.
it's
one
of
the
parts
of
the
statute
that
indicates
the
coexistence
of
the
longshore
act
and
the
jones
act,
but
one.
there
are
four
others.
the
second
one
is--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--it
could,
but
what
we're
trying
to
determine
here
is
whether
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
various
iterations
of
the
longshore
act,
meant
for
an
alj
award
to
be
preclusive
or
not.
this
is
just
one
of
five
circumstances
in
the
act
that
indicates
they
didn't
mean--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--no.
it's
not
preclusive
in
either
one.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
longshore
benefits
are
paid
voluntarily
by
employers.
jones
act
benefits
are
not
paid
voluntarily
by
employers.
you
have
to
file
a
suit
under
the
jones
act.
you
have
to
take
the
position
you're
a
jones
act
seaman.
if
you
take
the
position
you're
a
jones
act
seaman,
you're
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
if
you
present
a
prima
facie
case
that
you're
a
jones
act
seaman.
i
believe
that
that's
what
this
plaintiff
did
here,
and
the
judge
got
into
factual
circumstances
beyond
the
prima
facie
case
and
granted
summary
judgment.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
that's
right,
and
that's
the
choice
the
litigant
takes.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
definitely
not,
because
he's
injured
on
board
a
vessel,
and
the
situs
of
his
injury
would
not
entitle
him
to
state
comp
under
any
circumstances.
i
want
to
get--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--nothing.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
maintenance
in
cure
has
nothing
to
do
with
unseaworthy.
it
has
to
do--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
yes,
as
long
as
he's
temporarily
disabled.
as
soon
as
he
becomes
permanently
disabled,
he
gets
nothing.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
it
has
nothing
to
do
with...
no,
it
isn't,
it's
$22
a
day
in
this--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--because
that...
it
has...
that's
a
tort
remedy.
that's
part
of
the
seaman's
tort,
unseaworthiness
and
negligence.
you
have
to
prove
a
case
of
unseaworthiness.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
yes.
unseaworthiness
is
absolute
liability,
like
products
liability.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
oh,
yes,
you
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
oh,
no.
yes,
you
have
a
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness.
that's
also
proving
a
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
just
under
a
lesser
standard.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
unless
he...
if
he
can't
prove
negligence,
the
chances
are
that
he...
it's
somewhat
unlikely.
well,
usually
it
goes
the
other
way
around.
it's
easier
to
prove
unseaworthiness
than
it
is
to
prove
negligence,
but
under
negligence
you
get
causation
no
matter
how
slight,
so
that
if
you
prove
negligence
the
causal
connection
between
the
accident
and
the
injury
has
to
be
a
lot...
can
be
a
lot
thinner
than
it
is
under
negligence.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
i
think
that's
correct.
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
that's
true
in
gizoni
anyway.
that's
already
been
established,
that
the
employer
paying
compensation
does
not
cut
off
the
jones
act
case.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
employer...
the
employee
obtaining
a
formal
award,
and
whether
that
formal
award
is
entitled
to
administrative
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
the
second
one
is
that
under
913(d)
of
the
longshore
act
the
statute
of
limitations
for
filing
a
claim
under
the
jones
act
is
tolled
while
the
employee
pursues
the
jones
act,
and
until
such
time
as
he's
found
to
be
not
a
seaman
by
the
court,
then
he's
relegated
to
the
longshore
act.
but
up
until
that
point
the
statute
is...
of
limitations
is
tolled.
the
third
one
is
under
922
of
the
longshore
act
any
formal
award
is...
can
be
modified
within
a
year
after
its
making,
which
makes
it
different
from
other
formal
awards
and
other
adjudications
by
the
alj's,
which
is
the
third
reason
why
this--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--i
believe
so.
i
don't
think
it's
ever
happened,
but
theoretically
it
can
be,
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
because
the
language
of
the
statute
says
any
aspect
of
any
order
entered
by
the
deputy
commissioner
can
be
modified
up
to
1
year,
and
that
means
any.
the
fourth
reason
is
in
the
purpose
of
the
longshore
act
itself.
if
you
do,
as
was
mentioned
by
justice
ginsburg
during
mr.
danoff's
argument,
if
you
make
a
formal
award
preclusive
and
you
remove
any
incentive
there
is
for
an
employer
to
make
voluntary
payment...
because
this
court
has
already
ruled
that
making
of
voluntary
payments
is
not
preclusive.
if
you
make
a
formal
award
preclusive,
that's
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
longshore
act,
which
is
to
foster
prompt
payment
of
compensation
and
medical
benefits
to
injured
workers.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--this
isn't--
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
--well,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
back
in
1920
there
were
no
worker's
compensation
laws,
and
back
in
1927,
in
1920
when
the
jones
act
was
enacted,
it
was
designed
to
give
itinerant
seamen
a
cause
of
action
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
against
their
employer.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
but
the
congress
decided
that
seamen
would
not
be
covered
by
state
worker's
comp.
mr.
thomas
j.
boyle
well,
there
was
no
federal
worker's
compensation
law
in
1920,
and
what
i
was
getting
at
is
the
purpose
of
the
jones
act,
and
this
is
the
fifth
reason,
is
to
afford
seamen
a
trial
by
jury...
crew
members,
really,
is
what
seamen
are...
a
trial
by
jury
of
the
issue
not
only
of
negligence
but
of
their
status.
and
in
that
trial
by
jury,
after
you
have
a
prima
facie
case
established,
which
i
believe
we
did
in
this
case
under
chandris
v.
latsis,
which
was
that
the
worker
had
contributed
to
the
function
and
mission
of
the
vessel,
and
that
he
had
a
connection
with
the
vessel
which
was
substantial
in
both
duration
and
in
nature,
then
that
goes
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
considers
things
like
perils
of
the
sea,
or
the
jury
considers
whether
you
ate,
slept,
or
lived
on
the
vessel.
a
jury
considers
whether
or
not
this
is
a
day-by-day
assignment.
but
the
prima
facie
case
is
made,
and
it's
for
the
jury
to
consider
all
the
circumstances.
an
alj
is
not
equipped
to
do
that.
now,
there's
four
things
about
this
particular
alj
determination
that
in
itself
makes
it
nonpreclusive,
and
the
second
one
of
that
is
the
laches
that
this
defendant,
this
petitioner,
after
believing
that
sharp
governed
this
case,
after
believing
that
it
would
be
preclusive,
did
not
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
district
judge,
but
waited
until
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
laches.
that
prevents
preclusion.
and
the
fourth
one
is,
if
this
court
decides
to
follow
sharp,
this
is
a
change
in
the
law
from
back
in
197...
1992.
