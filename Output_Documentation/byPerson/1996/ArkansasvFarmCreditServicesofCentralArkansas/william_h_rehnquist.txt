chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-1918,
arkansas
v.
farm
credit
services
of
central
arkansas.
ms.
hunt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
appears,
ms.
hunt,
do
you
mean
appears
as
a
party
plaintiff,
rather
than
just
perhaps
files
an
amicus
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
far
as
the
united
states
being
a
party,
you're
stuck
with
the
decision
of
the
department
of
employment
security.
there
is
an
exemption
if
the
united
states
appears
as
a
party,
and
you
don't
have
any
trouble
with
that,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
you
would
say,
then,
that
nash-finch,
the
nlrb
case,
deals
with
the
anti-injunction
act
generally,
not
with
the
tax
injunction
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
ms.
hunt.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
saying
that
the
executive
branch
should
have
any
leverage
in
deciding
whether
there's
an
exemption
or
not.
you're
just
saying
if
it's
a
coplaintiff
that
should
survive
the
tax
injunction
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
hanson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
position
is
that
unless
congress
has
affirmatively
waived
that
immunity,
they
are
immune?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
a
lot
of
case
law
contrary
to
that,
it
seems
to
me.
the
cases
that
say
you
have
to
look
at
what
congress
has
said,
not
saying
that
the
burden
is
necessarily
on
those
who
would
show
that
congress
had
not
waived
the
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
would
say
this
is
true
of
every
single
thing
that
is
called
a
federal
instrumentality?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
do
benefit
the
farmers--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--rather
than
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rather
than
taxpayers,
let's
say.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
say
that,
though,
about
a
lot
of
the
government
contractor
cases
that
were
involved...
that
were
discussed
in
new
mexico.
you
can
say
ultimately
the
federal
government
is
going
to
pick
up
the
increased
tab.
that
didn't
make...
for
a
contractor--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
court
could
have
said
that
in
department
of
employment
security,
and
it
didn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
didn't
reject
your
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
could
have
gone
the
way
that
would
have
supported
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
rule
that
said
nash-finch
was
the
general
anti-injunction
act
and
shouldn't
be
carried
over
to
the
tax
injunction
act,
so
that
neither
federal
agencies
nor
federal
instrumentalities
can
get
out
of
the
tax
injunction
act.
that
would
obviate
the
problem
of
the
department
of
justice.
it
would
also
make
you
lose
your
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hanson.
ms.
hunt,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hunt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
