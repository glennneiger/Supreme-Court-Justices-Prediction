justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
hunt,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
discrete
jurisdictional
issue,
which
this
court
asked
the
parties
to
address.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
to
the
jurisdictional
question
goes
a
long
way,
if
not
all
the
way,
to
answer
the
question
on
the
merits
as
well.
would
you
agree
with
that,
that
how
you
categorize
this
agency
for
purposes
of
the
tax
injunction
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hanson,
whatever
this
was
originally
when
there
was
a
federal
administrator
involved,
is
there
anything
that
these
entities
are
doing
that
the
farmers
and
ranchers
couldn't
have
done
getting
together
for
themselves?
is
there
anything
that
they
are
doing
that
is
an
exercise
of
federal
power,
or
are
they
just
acting,
admittedly
with
the
spark
provided
by
the
government,
but
as
any
privately
arranged
cooperative
could
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
power
that
they're
exercising
is
what
the
farmers
and
the
ranchers
choose
to
confer
on
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
lots
of
private
actors
are
given
federal
help.
universities
and
colleges
are
given
federal
help,
but
that
doesn't
make
them
government
agencies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
functions
ally
them
with
the
government
rather
than
with
the
private
members,
because
i
think
you
answered
my
question
candidly
that
they
can
do,
these
pca's
can
do
only
what
the
members
choose
to
allow
them
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
tell
me
if
there
are
other
instrumentalities
where
all
of
the
people,
all
of
the
personnel
are
on
private
payrolls,
not
government
payrolls,
that
would
have
this
tax
immunity--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--from
income
tax,
state
income
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
distinction
between
the...
a
federal
credit
union
and
the
pca's.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hanson,
it
took
me
a
while,
but
the
farm
credit
union
example
that
you
gave
in
answer
to
my
earlier
question,
as
i
understand,
that
is
entirely
statutory.
the
code
exempts
them
from
federal,
state,
or
local
taxation
except
for
their
real
and
personal
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
recognize
that
you
can
be
an
instrumentality
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
there
is
a
pattern
in,
say,
federally
chartered
institutions
for
when
congress
labels
them
federal
instrumentalities
and
when
it
doesn't,
say
the
girl
scouts
and
the
boy
scouts,
and
the
red
cross
and
the
others?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
perhaps
it
was
a
definition
that
came
in
originally
when
this...
these
associations
were
headed
by
a
federal
administrator,
and
since
the
character
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--association
changed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
mean
reaffirmed
by
some
positive
act,
or
just
so
they
didn't
change
it?
