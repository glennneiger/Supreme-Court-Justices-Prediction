justice
john
paul
stevens
your
bright
line...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand...
is
a
distinction
between
an
agency
and
an
instrumentality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
the
statute
had
called
this
entity
an
agency
instead
of
an
instrument?
what
if
they
just
gave
it
that
name?
would
that
be
enough?
i
mean,
part
of
the
problem
here
is
we're
not
sure
the
name
has
any
legal
significance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just
wondering
how
you
know
so
clearly
as
to
such
a
bright
line
that
tells
us
whether
it's
an
instrumentality
or
an
agency.
that's
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
wouldn't
it
make
sense
to
have
the
test
simply
be
whether
federal
dollars
are
at
stake
as
the
exemption
for
the
tax
injunction
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
would
the
answer
be...
in
your
view,
would
the
same
test
apply
under
both
the
tax
injunction
act
and
the...
2283?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
response
to
the
michigan
case
where
he
says
the
government
took
just
the
opposite
position
in
that
case?
