justice
antonin
scalia
why
leave
it
to
the
executive
branch
to
decide
what's
an
instrumentality
that
is
deserving
of
the
exemption
and
what
isn't?
that's
what
your
position
boils
down
to.
if
the
solicitor
general,
or
at
the
lower
level,
i
suppose,
the
civil
division
of
the
department
of
justice,
decides
to
argue
for
immunity
under
the
tax...
from
the
tax
injunction
act,
then
it
wins.
otherwise,
it
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
really
expect
us
to
hold
that
if
the
president
is
annoyed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
instructs
the
solicitor
general
or
the
civil
division
of
the
justice
department
not
to
appeal
in
order
to
enable
that
agency
to
claim
the
benefit
of
the
exemption
from
the
anti-injunction
act,
then
that's
the
way
it
will
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
regardless
of
what
congress...
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
congress'
intention
to
establish
the
nlrb
as
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
it's
all
up
to
the
executive
whether
he
wants
to
appear
in
court
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
tell
me
why
i
should
do
that,
why
i
should
leave
this
issue
of
law
under
a
congressional
statute
to
be
decided
dispositively
by
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
president,
during
the
presidency
of
franklin
roosevelt
the
civil
division
does
appear
on
behalf
the
labor
board
and
says,
this
is
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
we
claim
an
exemption
from
the...
okay.
however,
during
the
administration
of
harry
truman,
with
a
similar
suit,
the
civil
division
chooses
not
to
appear.
is
the
labor
board
branded
once
and
forever
as
an
agency
of
the
united
states
by
reason
of
the
first
appearance
under
the
prior
administration,
or
can
it
be
undone
by
the
second?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hunt,
could
we
borrow
a
test
from
somewhere
else?
what
about
just
applying
the
same
test
that
we
would
apply
for
sovereign
immunity?
you
know,
if
you
sue
the
labor
board
you
would
not
get
anywhere.
why
don't
we
just
say
the
same
thing,
it's
any
agency
that
would
come
under
our
sovereign
immunity
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
i
hate
to
go
on
creating
different
tests
for
all
these
different
purposes.
can
we
agree
that
the
test
here
is
the
same
as
the
test
for
sovereign
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not...
leaving
out
the
situation
where
the
government
has
said
that
a
particular
instrumentality
can
or
cannot
sue
or
be
sued.
let's
assume
that,
you
know,
there's
nothing
said.
would
applying
the
general
rules
for
sovereign
immunity
of
agencies
or
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
produce
the
same
result
that
you're
arguing
for
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it's
closely
related.
is
it
the
same
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
say
that
about
chrysler
corporation,
come
to
think
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
just
probabilities.
