well,
certainly
the
courts
have
recognized
some
implied
exemptions
from
that
tax
injunction
act,
haven't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
example,
for
the
nlrb.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what's
the
test?
if
we're
going
to
have
an
implied
exemption,
what's
the
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
the
only
instance?
i
don't
think
that's
the
position
of
the
government,
is
it,
the
federal
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
red
cross?
i
mean,
that...
it's
hard
to
look
at
that
as
so
much
a
part
of
the
government
that
it
should
share
the
government's
exempt
status,
and
yet
we
have
a
case
where
at
least
when
the
government
was
a
coplaintiff
it
came
within
the
exception.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
that's
enough
to
answer
the
question.
the
federal
government
provides
help
to
support
the
arts.
that
doesn't
mean
that
a
company
providing
artistic
service
ought
to
be
extended
some
form
of
government
immunity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yet
there's
a
government
purpose
there.
it
serves
a
government
purpose,
and
that's
what's
happened
now
to
the
production
credit
association.
yes,
congress
wants
to
be
sure
that
farmers
and
ranchers
have
credit
to
help
them
over
the
hard
times,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
whether
immunity
should
exist
or
whether
you
ought
to
go
first
into
state
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
would
be
nice
to
get--
--well,
certainly...
certainly
you
could
file
your
suit
in
state
court
here.
you
admit
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
indeed,
if
you're
going
to
get
a
refund
of
any
taxes
paid
you're
going
to
have
to,
aren't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what's
the
harm
in
saying,
gee,
this
is
the
kind
of
situation
where
it
ought
to
track
the
eleventh
amendment
situation,
go
to
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
always
have
the
right
to
petition
to
this
court
if
you
think
the
state
courts
have
erred
on
the
merits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
it
ought
to
be
the
same
kind
of
a
test
we'd
employ
to
see
if
there's
some
exception
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
your
position
be
if
the
statute
here
had
not
been
amended
and
were
the
same
as
it
had
been?
