mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principle
underlying
the
exception
to
the
tax
injunction
act
that
was
recognized
in
department
of
employment
was
described
by
this
court
in
1960
in
federal
power
commission
v.
tuscarora
indian
nation
as,
"general
statutes
imposing
restrictions
do
not
apply
to
the
government
itself
without
a
clear
expression
to
that
effect.
"
and
in
1947
in
united
states
v.
united
mineworkers,
instead
of
to
the
government
itself
the
court
said,
will
not
be
applied
to
the
sovereign.
now,
who
is
the
sovereign,
or
the
government
for
this
purpose
in
our
modern,
complex
governmental
framework?
while
the
term,
instrumentality
is
often
used
on
the
merits
of
questions
of
tax
immunity,
because
obviously
the
government
itself
cannot
be
taxed,
and
the
issue
is
about
whether
an
instrumentality
is
immune
from
tax,
the
expression
that
the
court
used
when
it
addressed
this
closely
analogous
question
in
nlrb
v.
nash-finch
under
section
2283
of
title
28,
was
the
united
states
and
its
agencies,
or
in
one
instance
it
used
the
term,
public
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
sometimes
they're
designated
an
instrumentality.
sometimes
that
question
is
up
in
the
air.
but
the
question
is
always,
instrumentality
for
what
purpose?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
always.
sometimes
they're
just
designated
a
government
enterprise,
but
in
footnote
8
of
our
brief
we
try
to
explain
that
the
same
body
can
be
an
instrumentality
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
another
under
various
holdings.
but
what
is
different
about
an
agency
from
other
instrumentalities?
one
model
for
an
answer,
and
these
terms
are
not
always
used
in
precisely
the
same
way
from
one
context
to
another,
but
one
model
for
an
answer
is
in
the
words
themselves.
an
instrumentality,
or
an
instrument,
is
a
tool
or
a
device
through
which
the
government
accomplishes
an
objective.
it
may
be
a
very
important
objective,
but
it
may
be
accomplished
through
a
contractor,
a
corporation,
or
what-have-you.
an
agency
is
related
to
the
law
of
agency.
an
agent
is
someone
who
shares
in
the
governmental
authority,
or
what
we
would
call
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
government,
and
that
in
our
system
is
at
least
an
important
way
of
looking
at
it.
another
way
of
differentiating
the
group
to
whom
the
exception
should
extend
is
whether
it
is
a
public
governmental
body,
or
a
privately
owned
enterprise.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there...
there
it
was
held
to
be
entitled
to
a
tax
immunity,
but
it
was
not
held
to
be
within
the
exception
to
the
tax
injunction
act.
the
exception
was
recognized
in
that
case
because
the
united
states
was
a
coplaintiff.
the
court
did
not
address
whether
the
red
cross
could
have
brought
the
suit
in
federal
court
itself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
think
it's
closely
related,
but
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
are
reasons...
there
are
reasons
i
would
hesitate
to
say
it's
the
same.
in
some
instances
it
would
require
the
court
to
address
a
hypothetical
constitutional
question
in
order
to
answer
a
question
that
really
could
be
resolved
without
resort
to
that.
there
is...
if
i
can
commend
to
the
court's
attention
just
one
of
the
lower
court
cases
that
i
think
particularly
rewards
study
it
would
be
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
boston
case,
in
which
levin
campbell
wrote
for
the
first
circuit
a
very
thoughtful
opinion
about
why
he
concluded
that
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
boston,
because
it
functions
as
an
arm
of
the
government
sharing
an
important
regulatory
authority,
would...
should
have
the
benefit
of
this
exception.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
considerations
are
the
same
as
whether
it
would
be
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity,
whether
or
not
the
answer
would
be
the
same--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
that
it's
a
good
model,
and
probably
would
be
the
same
test.
that
view
is
not
universally
held
within
the
government.
i
have
many
nervous
agencies
and
instrumentalities
out
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
what
judge
campbell
suggested--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--for
the
first
circuit
on
this
very
point
was
that
the
court
should
respect
the
reasons
why
congress
has
chosen
to
confer
independent
litigating
authority
in
the
lower
courts
on
certain
agencies,
because
they
should
to
some
degree
be
insulated
from
the
executive
chain
of
command,
and
i
think
it's
very
well
put.
it's
an
opinion
that
deserves--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
rewards
study.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
we
could
have.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
believe
so.
it
would
be
very
similar
to
the
interest
in
the
intervention
in
department
of
employment,
the
case
itself,
on
behalf
of
the
red
cross'
exemption.
these
farm
credit
institutions
perform
an
important
federal
statutory
function
under
the
oversight
of
the
farm
credit
administration,
some
of
the
others
are
explicitly
conferred
tax
exemptions,
and
the
government
might
well
come
forward.
they're
part
of
the
executive
branch
in
such
cases.
now,
i
might
just
say--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--exactly,
so
it's
up
to
the
courts
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
exemption
issue.
obviously,
the
willingness
of
the
government
to
come
forward
might
have
something
to
do
with
its
view
of
the
merits,
and
if
i
could
just
say
a
word
about
the
merits...
since
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
the
merits,
the
court
may
choose
to
comment
on
the
merits
because
of
that.
we
think
that
this
is
a
clear
case
for
application
of
the
rule
of
the
russello
case
that,
when
different
provisions
of
a
statute
address
the
matter
explicitly
in
different
ways,
that
difference
should
be
respected.
this
is
a
matter
that
congress
has
addressed
from
the
outset.
under
this
scheme,
the
reliance
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
is
on
the
part
of
a
deletion
of
two
sentences
which
we
have
italicized--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--on
page
5
of
their
brief.
