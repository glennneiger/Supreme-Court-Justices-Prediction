ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
was
decided
incorrectly
by
the
lower
courts
in
two
respects.
first,
the
district
court
should
have
dismissed
the
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
under
the
tax
injunction
act.
second,
on
the
merits,
the
reliance
of
the
lower
courts
on
a
doctrine
of
implied
immunity
of
production
credit
associations
from
state
taxation
is
erroneous
when
12
u.s.c.
section
2077
clearly
provides
the
extent
to
which
production
credit
associations
are
exempt
from
arkansas
or
from
any
state
sales
and
income
tax.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
it
was
argued
in
the
district
court--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--but
not
in
the
eighth
circuit.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
not
in
either,
that's
correct.
the
tax
injunction
act,
which
is
printed
on
page
2
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
28
u.s.c.
section
1341,
provides
an
absolute
statutory
bar
to
federal
court
jurisdiction
so
long
as
the
state
provides
an
adequate
remedy
to
taxpayers
who
are
seeking
to
assert
a
claim
against
state
taxation.
the
respondents
concede
that
the
state
of
arkansas's
remedy
is
adequate.
this
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
respondents
have
currently
pending
in
state
court
a
claim
for
a
refund
of
these
income
and
sales
taxes
based
on
the
same
theory
for
which
they
ask
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
federal
court.
the
respondents
filed
the
suit
on
their
own
behalf.
the
united
states
did
not
appear
with
them
as
a
coplaintiff
or
to
represent
them.
the
court
has
confirmed
that
an
implied
exemption
to
the
tax
exemption
act
exists
for
the
united
states.
in
the
court's
decision
in
department
of
employment,
the
language
of
the
court
leads
us
to
believe
that
this
exemption
applies
when
the
united
states
appears
to
protect
its
interest
or
that
of
its
instrumentalities.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be
my
contention,
that
that
language
does
suggest
that.
the
respondents
contend,
however,
that
this
implied
exemption
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
should
be
extended
to
federal
instrumentalities.
respondents
are--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--that
is
correct,
justice--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--i
am
not
aware
that
in
the
context
of
the
tax
injunction
act
there
has
been
an
exemption
applied
for
the
nlrb.
i
am
aware
that
the
solicitor
general
has
analogized
the
tax
injunction
act
to
the
general
anti-injunction
act,
to
which
there
is
an
implied
exemption.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
make--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--our
test
that
we
would
like
to
advocate
to
the
court
is
a
bright
line
test.
if
the
united
states
appears
with
the
instrumentality
to
assert
its
interest
then
jurisdiction
is
proper
in
the
district
court.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
i
don't
believe...
i
believe
they
do
disagree
with
that
in
some
respect.
i
believe
that
their
advocacy,
though,
would
lead
toward
extending
the
applied
exemption
to
agencies
of
the
government,
as
i
understand
their
argument.
we
make
a
distinction,
we
draw
a
distinction
between
agencies
and
instrumentalities.
certainly
there
is
a
much
more
compelling
reason
for
extending
the
implied
exemption
to
agencies
who
would
be
functioning
as
arms
of
the
government,
who
might
be
regulating.
their
functions
would
certainly
be
governmental
functions
in
a
much
greater
respect
than
those
of
instrumentalities.
there
are
several--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does
appear
that
that
would
be
the
case.
there
is
always
the
provision
in
the
tax
injunction
act
that
provides
that
if
an
adequate
state
remedy
does
not
exist,
then
the
entity
can
appear
in
district
court.
if
this
is
an
instrumentality
who
is
seeking
to
assert
its
interest,
then
if
there
is
an
adequate
state
remedy,
it
can
assert
those
interests
in
the
state
court.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
certainly
have
no
problem
with
that.
of
course,
we
are
advocating
a
bright
line.
we
understand
that
the
lower
courts
have
distinguished
this
bright
line
and
have
not
adopted
that,
and
that
there
have
been
lower
court
decisions
who
have
looked
at
the
governmental
nature,
for
example,
of
the
instrumentality
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
should
be
allowed
to
appear
on
its
own
behalf.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
that
is
correct.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
i
believe
that
in
most
cases
an
agency
would
be
designated
by
statute
as
an
agency
of
the
government.
they
would
obviously--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--the
instrumentality--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--that
is
why
we
would
advocate
an
even
more
bright
line,
actually,
and
draw
the
line
and
say,
if
any
entity
appears
the
united
states
should
appear.
perhaps
i
was
not
entirely
clear
in
trying
to
distinguish
between
them.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
there
are,
too...
there
is
a
difference
in
the
purpose
of
those
two
acts
that
i
would
also
like
to
distinguish.
the
purpose
of
the
general
anti-injunction
act
was
to
prevent
conflict
between
federal
and
state
courts,
whereas
the
purpose
of
the
tax
injunction
act
was
to
limit
federal
court
jurisdiction
when
the
subject
that's
being
considered
is
state
taxation.
this
is
in
recognition
of
the
vast
importance,
the
crucial
importance
to
states
of
their
ability
to
deal
with
state
tax
matters
that
affect
them.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
yes,
justice
scalia.
under--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--under
the
bright...
under
the
absolute
bright
line
test
for
the
presence
of
the
united
states,
that
would
be
necessary.
as--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--obviously,
if
the
president
of
the
united
states,
the
executive
department,
examines
the
entity
that
it
is
there
to
represent
and
makes
this
determination
to
appear,
under
the
bright
line
test
that
would
be
a
decision
that
would
be
left
to
the
executive
department.
as
a
practical
matter,
in
instances
of
state
taxation,
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
of
an
example
where
a
state
would
attempt
to
tax
an
agency.
state--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
could
be
undone.
if
you
are
allowing
the
executive
to
make
that
decision,
then
it
appears
that
it
would
be
within
the
executive's
discretion
under
that
test.
of
course,
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
in
considering
that
the
entities
here
are
production
credit
associations,
regardless
of
whether
the
court
adopts
a
bright
line
test,
and
even
if
the
court
should
determine
that
a
much
more
flexible
test
is
appropriate,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
production
credit
associations
would
fail
to
meet
the
standard
regardless
of
what
the
test
is,
even
if
it's
a
more
flexible
governmental
nature
of
the
organization.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
believe
that
the
tests
are
different
here.
the
test
for
purposes
of
the
tax
injunction
act
has
not
totally
been
established
by
this
court.
however,
i
believe
the
test
for
whether
or
not
an
instrumentality
has
been...
tax
immunity
has
been
conferred
on
an
instrumentality
is
determined
first
of
all
by
looking
to
whether
or
not
congress
has
addressed
the
issue.
if
congress
has
clearly
addressed
the
issue
of
tax
immunity,
then
i
think
that
forecloses
further
inquiry
by
the
court
into
the
tax
exempt
status,
so
in
that
respect
i
believe
the
tests
are
different.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
if
the
only
test
were
whether
or
not
federal
dollars
were
at
stake,
there
would
be
many,
many
entities
who
would
then
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
tax
injunction
act.
there
are
so
many
entities
that
in
some
respect
have
a
stake
in
federal
money
who
do
not
execute
agency
functions,
so
in
that
respect
i
don't
believe
that
merely
the
infusion
of
some
sort
of
government
capital
or
access
to
government
capital
would
be
a
sufficient
test
to
decide
this
case.
in
addition
to
the
other
respects,
congress
also
has
the
power
to
provide
an
exemption
to
the
tax
injunction
act.
for
example,
in
the
moe
decision
this
court
construed
a
statute
that
had
been
passed,
section
28
u.s.c.
1362
which
deals
specifically
with
the
indian
tribes,
to
be
an
implied
exemption
to...
not
an
implied
exemption,
but
to
be
a
statutory
exemption
to
the
tax
injunction
act,
which
was
passed
sometime
after
the
tax
injunction
act.
since
this
is
an
implied
immunity
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states,
it
is
our
contention
that
implied
immunity
should
be
strictly
construed,
and
before
the
court
would
extend
this
implied
immunity
to
another
entity,
this
court
should
look
very
carefully
at
that
extension.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
in
the
sense
of
sovereign
immunity
this
has
frequently
been
addressed
by
statute,
by
the
sue-and-be-sued
statutes,
so
this
alone
would
not
be
a
sufficient
test
because
that
might
have
been
spoken
to
by
congress
already,
and
then
you
would
have
to
enter
into
that
sphere
of
statutory
language
dealing
with
the
sue-and-be-sued
provision.
may
i
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal?
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
first
of
all,
regardless
of
test
that
the
court
decides
to
apply,
the
respondents'
arguments
that
they
are
entitled
to
first
of
all
status
under
the
tax
injunction
act
that
would
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
united
states
is
certainly
not
something
that
they
have
successfully
been
able
to
argue.
first
of
all,
their
argument
that
they
are
a
federal
instrumentality
certainly
does
not
imply
that
that
is
the
case
for
all
purposes.
there
are--
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
--there
is
a
specific
statute,
a
specific
taxation
statute
that
relates
to
the
federal
credit
unions
that
gives
them
a
very
broad
immunity
from
taxation.
in
fact,
that
statute
is
very
similar
in
wording
and
in
language
to
the
statute
that
the
pca's
had
prior
to
the
amendment,
and
at
the
time
that
they
were
government-owned,
so
federal
credit
unions
may
be
distinguished
in
that
respect
in
that
their
tax
immunity
is
very
clear
by
statute.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
if
the
statute
were
the
same,
where
the...
well,
first
of
all
i
need
to
answer
that
in
two
respects.
if
the
statute
were
exactly
the
same,
then
we
would
make
the
argument
that
because
the
pca's
are
now
privately
owned,
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
that
exemption
because
the
last
sentence
of
that
original
statute
provided
that
at
the
time
they
became
privately
owned
the
broad
exemption
was
waived,
so
my
answer
would
be
they
would
still
have
essentially
the
same
immunity
that
they
do
today
because
they
are
privately
owned.
in
another
respect
there
are
many
other
federal
instrumentalities
other
than
production
credit
associations.
for
example,
the
other
government-sponsored
enterprises
like
ginnie
mae,
fanny
mae,
freddie
mac,
and
all
of
those
entities
are
designated
by
statute
as
federal
instrumentalities.
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
enacting
statutes
where
federal...
where
production
credit
associations
are
designated
instrumentalities,
which
is
printed
on
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
roman
i,
first
of
all
it
says
each
production
credit
association
shall
continue
as
a
federally
chartered
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
this
is
quoting
directly
from
12
u.s.c.
section
2071(a).
it
is
my
contention
that
this
designation
simply
implies
that
congress
has
the
power
to
create
or
to
allow
these
farmers
to
band
together
and
to
charter
these
institutions,
because
again,
on
the
same
page
at
12
u.s.c.
section
2071
(b)(7),
there's
the
same
instrumentality
language
relating
to
the
fact
that
pca's
are
federally
chartered
body
corporate
and
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
then,
in
their
statute,
the
pca
statute
relating
to
their
taxation,
which
is
printed
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
2,
we
again
see
the
instrumentality
language.
quoting
from
2077,
each
production
credit
association
and
its
obligations
are
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
and
as
such,
going
on
with
the
language
of
the
exemption
from
tax.
it
is
my
contention
that
that
language
is
there
for
a
specific
purpose,
in
the
first
instance
to
show
that
congress
has
power
to
create
these
institutions,
and
in
the
second
to
show
that
congress
has
the
power
to
immunize
them
to
the
limited
degree
that
they
did
from
tax,
which
leads
into
the
argument
on
the
merits.
the
respondents'
attempt
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
mcculloch
to
this
case,
there
is
a
very
specific
reason
why
the
doctrine
of
mcculloch
does
not
apply
here.
there
was
no
tax
exemption
statute
in
mcculloch
which
led
the
court
to
construe
the
implied
immunity.
ms.
martha
grissom
hunt
thank
you.
