mr.
richard
a.
hanson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question
as
to
what
standards
ought
to
apply
in
determining
application
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
application
of
sovereign
immunity
concepts,
application
of
tax
immunity
concepts,
but
i
think
it
really
has
two
pieces.
one
is
that
the
same
standard
should
apply
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
entity
is
a
federal
instrumentality,
and
the
court's
most
recent
discussion
of
that
is
in
u.s.
v.
new
mexico,
where
they
talked
about
an
entity
being
so
closely
connected
to
the
government
that
it
cannot
be
viewed
as
a
separate
party.
now,
beyond
that,
and
i
think
the
court
said
this
in
federal
land
bank
v.
priddy,
you
then
get
to
the
question
of
whether...
and
let
me
back
up
just
a
second.
in
federal
land
bank
v.
priddy
the
court,
talking
about
a
federal
land
bank,
which
is
one
of
the
institutions
of
the
system,
said
that
it
would
partake
of
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
absent
a
waiver
by
congress,
and
there
was
sue-and-be-sued
language
in
the
statutes,
therefore
the
court
concluded
that
sovereign
immunity
to
some
extent
had
been
waived.
the
issue
in
that
case
involved
execution
of
a
judgment.
the
result
which
you
get
in
a
tax
injunction
act
case,
an
immunity
case,
a
sovereign
immunity
case,
a
case
involving
punitive
damages,
and
a
case
involving
estoppel,
all
of
which
are
issues
which
have
been
addressed
by
this
court
or
the
lower
courts,
then
turns
on
what
has
congress
done?
and
it
becomes
a
question
of,
you
know
they're
a
federal
instrumentality.
you
know
they
partake
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states.
now,
what
does
the
governing
statute
tell
you
about
what
congress
has
done
in
terms
of
waiver
of
tax
immunity,
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
on
the
merits,
unless
congress
has
affirmatively
consented
to
the
taxation
of
these
entities
by
arkansas,
180
years
of
case
law
says
that
we
are
immune.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
where
this
court
has
departed
from
the
rule
that
immunity
is
implied
under
the
supremacy
clause,
and
immunity
exists
unless
congress
has
consented
to
taxation,
and
certainly
that
has
been--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--if
it
is
a
federal
instrumentality,
and
that
really
in
large
part
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
you
know,
the
government
of
the
united
states
on
brief
said
that
these
entities
perform
no
governmental
function.
now,
they
say
that
in
the
face
of
a
preamble
which
explains
exactly
what
they
do,
in
the
face
of
being
repeatedly
designated...
and
frankly
for
current
institutions
this
is
a
unique
designation...
federal
instrumentalities,
and
in
face
of
a
number
of
decisions
by
this
court
involving
various
farm
credit
system
entities.
but
i
think
the
other
thing
they
say
we
need
to...
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
bit
further.
they
say
that
these
entities
exist
to
make
profits
for
their
members,
and
that
simply
misconceives
the
nature
of
the
farm
credit
system.
when
the
federal
land
banks
were
created
back
in
1916,
congress
referred
to
the
farm
credit
system
as
a
bridge
between
farmers
and
the
credit
markets.
they
said
the
federal
government
cannot
provide
a
mechanism
to
get
adequate
credit
to
farmers,
that
the
commercial
banking
institutions
cannot
provide
a
mechanism
to
get
adequate
credit
to
farmers,
so
what
we
will
do
is,
we
will
provide
a
federally
supported
mechanism,
and
that's
all
the
modern
farm
credit
system
does.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
if
they
are...
there
are
not
in
any
material
way
exercising
any
federal
regulatory
power.
the
regulatory
power
exists
in
the
farm
credit
administration.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
with
the
support
of
the
united
states,
but
there
is
a
reason
why
the
system
was
set
up
this
way.
now,
obviously
there
are
all
sorts
of
federal
farm
programs
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
federal
lending
programs.
there
are
lending
programs
for
students.
there
are
lending
programs
for
small
business,
for
veterans,
for
homeowners.
a
determination
was
made
that
the
unique
nature
of
agricultural
credit
required
a
system
set
up
so
that
the
farmers
would
become
the
managers
of
their
own
system.
they
could
not
have
done
it
without
federal
support.
they
couldn't
have
done
it
in
1916,
they
couldn't
have
done
it
in
1933,
and
they
can't
do
it
without
federal
regulation.
what
the...
and
in
1985,
it
was
again
proven
that
the
system
itself
required
and
was
in
fact
given
federal
help,
so
while
it
is
true
that
the
day-to-day
management
operations
have
been
given
to
the
farmers--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--the
program
under
which
that
help
is
given,
the
program
may
or
may
not
be
a
federal
agency,
or
a
federal
instrumentality,
but
my
point
is
that
the
farm
credit
system
does
not
exist
to
make
profit
for
its
members.
the
farm
credit
system
exists
to
accomplish
a
governmental
objective,
which
is
stated
in
section
2001,
which
is
to...
that
a
program
needs
to
exist
to
provide
adequate
secure
and
affordable
credit
to
farmers.
congress
looked
and
said,
the
way
we
will
do--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--no,
i
would
absolutely
agree,
and
that
in
part
was
what
was
addressed
in
u.s.
v.
new
mexico.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
i--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
let
me
contrast
perhaps
two
different
institutions.
you
have
an
independent
contractor
who
is...
contracts
with
the
government
to
perform
a
governmental
function.
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
that
contractor
is
a
separate
entity
pursuing
its
own
private
profit
interests,
and
the
fact
that
it
is
performing
a
function
for
the
government
doesn't
make
it
a
federal
instrumentality,
so
the
fact
that
a
company
assists
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts
doesn't
make
it
a
federal
instrumentality
under
u.s.
v.
new
mexico
and
the
prior
cases.
my
point
is
here
that
these
entities
perform
no
function
except
the
specific
governmental
function
that
the
system
was
set
up
to
perform.
they
have
no
separate
private
existence.
now,
they
certainly
have
private
characteristics,
and
i
admit
that.
i
mean,
they
have
officers,
and
they
have
directors.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
they
can
do
only
what
the
government
allows
them
to
do
under
the
controlling
statute
and
regulations.
the
members
have
day-to-day
control.
but
that's
the
purpose
of
the
system.
i
mean,
the
governmental
function,
as
has
been
expressed
by
this
court,
is
to
provide
credit
to
farmers.
you've
just
defined
the
function.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--certainly
the
federal
credit
unions
would
be
an
analogous
situation,
and
one
of
the
ironies
in
this
case...
and
frankly
i
want
to
come
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
michigan
before
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
united
states
did
file
suit
on
behalf
of
the
federal
credit
unions
with
respect
to
a
michigan
sales
tax
issue.
they
argued
not
only
a
statutory
exemption
but
the
instrumentalities
were...
that
the
credit
unions
were
in
fact
instrumentalities.
they
did
so
by
analogy
to
the
farm
credit
system.
now,
we're
being
told
that
the
farm
credit
system
somehow
is
not
entitled
to
that
kind
of
representation.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
there
is
in
the
statutory
provision
describing
certain
aspects
of
the
tax
exemption,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
much
other
than
that,
and
the
sixth
circuit
basically
compares
and
contrasts
the
two
and
says
the
only
real
distinction
is
one
provides
financial
services
to
a
broader
range
of
the
public
than
the
farm
credit
system
does.
but
the
system
is
probably
fairly
stated
unique.
it
was
formed
because
there
was
a
congressional
determination
that
this
is
how
the
congressional
purpose
could
be
accomplished,
that
the
federal
government
can't
do
it
because
the
farm
economy
is
too
complex,
that
you
can't
run
the
system
from
washington.
the
legislative
history
on
the
'33
act
explains
that
a
centralized
federal
funding
program
during
the
early
stages
of
the
depression
had
managed
to
lose
some
$40
million
and
had
not
accomplished
its
purpose.
they
said,
we
can't
do
this,
so
what
we
will
do
is
we
will
set
up
a
farmer-supported
system,
or
a
federally
supported
system,
and
we
will
engage
the
farmers.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
get
into
this
system
to
make
a
profit.
it
means
that
if
a
farmer
wants
to
borrow
money
from
the
system,
he
has
to
buy
stock,
and
it's
mandatory.
it's
not
voluntary,
because
there
is
no
profit
potential.
it
is
a
cost
of
entry,
in
effect,
but
it
was
determined
that
that
way
the
farmer
would
be
interested
in
the
success
of
the
associations,
the
success
of
the
system
as
a
whole.
so
the
role
of
the
farmer
reflects
congress'
considered
decision
that
this
makes
sense
as
a
means
of
an
effective
system
for
delivery
of
credit,
but
you
know,
it's
a
closed
system,
too,
except
for
periodic
government
investment.
when
you
talk
about
where
the
system
gets
its
"earnings"
or
its
capital,
basically
that
comes
from
its
members.
they
provide
the
capital.
that
provided
the
source
of
funds
to
retire
government
stock.
it's
providing
the
source
of...
to
retire
the
government--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
it
is
interesting
that
the
government's
reference
to
the
federal
reserve
bank
case...
for
example,
the
federal
reserve
banks
are
capitalized
solely
by
their
member
banks.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
i
know.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
he
talks
about
the
regulatory
function
and
so
on.
i'm
aware
of
that,
but
i
go
back
to
the
nature
that
there
is
somehow
sort
of
a
separate
private
entity
here,
separate
from
the
performance
of
the--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--the
profits,
the
earnings,
as
this
court
recognized
in
kiawah
county,
are
not
a
distribution
of
profits
to
the
shareholder
of
the
system.
they
are
a
means,
which
is
another
part
of
the
design
of
the
system,
to
reduce
the
interest
cost
to
the
farmer,
and
that
was
part
of
the
initial
design
in
1916.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
the
farmer--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--they
benefit
the
government
to
this
extent,
and
that
is
that
currently,
as
part
of
the
package
of
assistance
that
was
provided
in
1987,
the
system
owes
the
treasury
some
$600
million,
and
not
only
do
they
owe
the
treasury
$600
million,
but
the
government
has
implicitly
guaranteed
the
system's
bonds,
and
i
realize
it's
not
a
statutory
guarantee,
but
the
market
believes
that
the
government
will
support
those
bonds
and,
of
course,
it
always
has.
so
that
any
additional
expense
that
you
place
on
the
system,
potentially
at
least,
increases
the
likelihood
of
the
government
having
to
come
back.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
that
did
not
make
it.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
you
could
say
it
about
them
also.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
but
as
to
none
of
those
could
you
say
that
congress
has
said
this
is
a
federally
chartered
instrumentality
of
the
united
states,
and
as
to
none
of
those
could
you
say
that
its
sole
function
is
to
perform
an
important
governmental
function.
i
mean,
what
we
have
here,
and
we
recognize
that,
you
know,
one
could
say
this
looks
like
a
bank.
now,
i
disagree,
because
it
looks
far
more
like
a
federal
reserve
bank
in
its
operations.
the
federal
reserve
bank
performs
significant
services
to
its
member
banks
through
discounting
and
otherwise.
does
that
make
it
not
a
federal
instrumentality?
obviously
not.
now,
i
grant
that
the
federal
reserve
banks
also
have
some
regulatory
authority.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
and--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
distribution
of
profits
to
private
persons.
we
do
not
perform
normal
banking
services.
we
do
only
one
thing.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
there
are
farmers
who
own
stock
for
which
they
receive
no
return,
and
if
that
stock
is
ever
redeemed,
which
is
at
the
discretion
of
the
banks--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--and
the
system--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--they
get
what
they
paid
in.
to
suggest
anybody
has
ever
invested
in
the
system
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--they
don't
get
a
profit.
what
you
do
see
is
a
system
set
up
to
reduce
their
interest
cost.
now,
obviously
they
get
a
benefit,
but
that's
the
benefit
that
congress
intended
in
the
first
instance.
i
keep
coming
back
to
that.
congress
has
said
we're
going
to
set
up
a
system,
we're
going
to
provide
it
with
an
implicit
guarantee
at
the
top,
we're
in
fact
going
to
provide
some
support
for
it,
if
you
will,
at
the
bottom
through
farm
price
support
programs,
and
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
helped
the
farmers
get
out
of
the
depression
of
the
mid-eighties,
as
the
system
itself
recognized.
so
we
have
this
system
which
serves
no
purpose
except
to
perform
a
governmental
function.
now--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--no.
it
is
true
that
they
have
a
statutory
provision
which
specifies
those
exemptions,
but
the
case
also
involved
the
proper
statute
of
limitations,
and
that
turned
on
a
constitutional
question,
whether
they
were
a
federal
instrumentality
for
supremacy
clause
purposes
in
the
decision
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well
now,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
what
this
court
has
ever
said.
what
this
court
has
said
is,
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
instrumentality.
now,
what
its
characteristics
are
with
respect
to
various
immunities
may
differ
depending
on
what
congress
has
said.
the
lower
courts
have
said,
well,
there's
this
kind
of
instrumentality
and
that
kind.
i
find
that
very
troubling,
because
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--actually,
the
only
pattern
is
that
we're
the
only
institutions
that
currently
bear
that
designation.
there
were...
that
specifically
are
designated
that
way.
there
are...
there
were
institutions
in
the
past,
i
believe
the
homeowner's
loan
corporation,
for
example,
was
designated
as
a
federal
instrumentality.
but
i
do
believe
there
are
a
set
of
characteristics
which
define
the
federal
instrumentality.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
that
designation
changed--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
that
designation
was
reaffirmed
in
1971,
when
all
the
government
stock
had
been
redeemed
and
when
the
farm
credit
administration
was
more
independent
than
originally,
so
it
certainly
doesn't--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--the
farm
credit
act
of
1971,
which
was
a
recodification
of
the
entire
act,
said
the
production
credit
associations
continued
to
be
federal
instrumentalities,
federally
chartered
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states,
so
it
was
an
affirmative
act
in
1971.
that's
interesting,
in
1987
various
new
entities
were
added
to
the
system.
there
was
a
federal
systems
corporation,
a
federal
insurance,
federal
farm
insurance
corporation,
service
corporations...
congress
gave
each
one
of
them
the
same
designation,
federally
chartered
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
so
as
i
say,
i
believe
that
statement,
that
designation
has
some
substance,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
substance
in
various
circumstances,
and
i
go
back
to
the
priddy
case,
which
said
that
a
federal
instrumentality
would
partake
of
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
and
would
exercise
sovereign
immunity
as
against
a
private
suit
absent
waiver
by
congress,
so
i
mean,
it
is
a
designation
that
does
have
significance.
i'd
like
to
spend
just
a
couple
of
minutes
talking
about
why
we
believe
that
a
bright
line
rule
that
requires
that
the
united
states
to
be...
or
the
justice
department,
whoever
it
would
be,
to
be
the
gatekeeper
in
suing
in
federal
court
we
think
is
inappropriate.
the
underlying
policy,
or
the
underlying
reason
for
department
of
employment,
as
i
understand
it,
was
the
notion
that
a
sovereign
should
not
be
viewed
as
having
relinquished
access
to
its
own
courts
absent
a
very
explicit
surrender.
that's
united
mineworkers
and
some
of
the
earlier
cases.
if
that's
a
fair
statement,
and
if
the
farm
credit
system
institutions
partake
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states,
then
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
any...
and
i...
and
if
we
are
talking
about
things
that
we
agree
are
federal
instrumentalities
i
don't
think
it's
a
stretch
to
say,
as...
and
this
goes
back
to
your
question
about,
justice
scalia,
the
question
of
whether
you
use
the
same
standard
for
sovereign
immunity
or
not.
i
don't
see
it's
any
stretch
to
say
that
one
should
ask
whether
congress
has
explicitly
said
that
the
federal
instrumentalities
are...
have
to
sue
in
state
court
to
vindicate
federal
rights
which
are
based
on
the
supremacy
clause.
i
mean,
that
seems
unlikely,
though
it
may
be
true.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
this
court
is
typically
careful
about
deciding
the
case
in
front
of
it,
and
the
case
in
front
of
it,
united
states
had
brought
suit
on
behalf
of
an
instrumentality.
interesting,
the
cases
it
cited
were
all
suits...
i
believe
they
were
all
suits
where
the
united
states
had
sued
in
the
lower
courts
on
behalf
of
what
we
would
now
say
were
not
federal
instrumentalities
but
were
private
contractors.
but
the
court
specifically
said
suits
by
the
united
states,
so
i
grant
that
it...
its...
it
clearly,
that
decision
does
not
give
us
permission
to
be
in
federal
court--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--it
did
not.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
yes.
but
wha...
i
think
more
troubling
than
sort
of
the
judicial
question,
while
i
recognize
that,
is
that
if
the
justice
department
becomes
what
i've
described
as
the
gatekeeper,
their
decision
is
both
sort
of
final
and
nonappealable
as
to
the
instrumentality,
except
perhaps
in
the
political
arena,
because
no
court
is
ever
going
to
look
at
it.
i
mean,
i
can't
go
to
federal
court
say
the
justice
department
won't
represent
me.
that's
simply
final.
and
what
considerations
the
executive
branch
may
bring
to
bear
on
that
i
offer
again
as
an
illustration.
they
sued
on
behalf
of
the
federal
credits
unions
in
1986
and
drew
an
analogy
to
us.
10
years
later,
we're--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
i
certainly
agree
that
trying
to
write
a
bright
line
here--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--i
appreciate
that,
so
i'm
not
sure
i'm
prepared
to
advocate
that
argument.
i
think
that
that
creates
both
a
participation
by
the
executive
branch
in
a
decision
which
they
are
not...
they
are
not
permitted
to
partake.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
right.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
in...
but...
you
know...
two
points.
one
is,
obviously
there
are
cases,
there
are
lower
court
cases
permitting
the
fdic
to
sue
on
its
own
behalf.
that
is
a
different
circumstance,
and
the
new
iberia
case
makes
i
think
a
pertinent
point,
is
that
all
of
the
considerations
that
led
to
the
passage
of
the
tax
injunction
act
are
completely
missing
here.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
sure.
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
right.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
i
think
the
concern
that
i
would
have
is
that
there
is
some
taint
associated
with
the
fact
that
this
type
of
entity,
unless
you
go
back...
if
you
adopt
a
bright
line
rule
of
the
united
states
has
to
be
a
party,
and
if
you
accept,
as
i
certainly
do
as
a
practicing
attorney
that,
given
a
federal
question
of
this
type
i'd
want
to
be
in
federal
court,
not
state
court,
i
mean,
with
no
disrespect
to
the
arkansas
courts,
my
preference,
as
the
united
states'
would
be,
would
be
in
federal
district
court.
if
i
have
to
go
to
state
court,
am
i
going
to
have
arkansas,
as
the
multi-state
tax
commission
say,
gee,
if
you
have
to
go
to
state
court
you're
really
not
serving
an
important
governmental
interest,
are
you,
or
did
the
united
states
decide
that,
you
know,
you're
wrong
on
the
merits.
we
go
into
state
court
with
some
serious
adverse
implications
from
the
decision
of
the
united
states,
and
i
think
those
implications
exist
whether
the
united
states
was
asked,
and
to
my
knowledge
they
were
not
in
this
case,
or
they're
asked
and
turn
you
down.
now,
in
fairness,
of
course,
we
have
that
same
problem
here,
because
we
have
a
brief
by
the
united
states
which
i'm
sure
will
be
widely
publicized.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
we
are
sufficiently
part
of
the
sovereign
that
the
principle
of
department
of
employment,
are
we...
did
congress
have
to
be
more
specific?
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
and...
i
think
that
the
test
may
be
in
part
the
same,
though...
though--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--i--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--i
believe
i
misspoke,
though,
because
one
difference
between
sovereign
immunity
is,
of
course,
that's
a
constitutional
protection
given
the
state.
this
is
simply...
not
simply.
this
is
a
congressional
action.
the
question
is,
congress
said,
all
right,
for
various
reasons,
comity
and
federalism
and
so
on,
we
want
private
suit
cases
in
state
court
and,
of
course,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
anybody's
identified
that
suggests
an
intention
to
cover
this
kind
of
a
case.
and
i
observe
that
james
v.
dravo,
which
i
find
kind
of
interesting
as
sort
of
a
landmark
federal
instrumentality
case,
was
brought
in
federal
court
by
private
attorneys
on
behalf
of
the
contractor,
and
granted
it
was,
i'm
sure,
litigation
that
started
before
the
tax
exemption
act
was
adopted,
but
there's
not
even
a
comment
about
it.
it
seemed
perfectly
natural.
and
the
united
states
participated
as
an
amicus,
taking
a
position
adverse
to
the
taxpayer,
and
the
court
decided
the
case.
but
it...
you
know,
i
admit
that's
simply...
maybe...
maybe
it's
just
an
historical
anomaly.
on
the
merits,
our
view
is,
as
expressed
in
professor
tribe's
article,
as
expressed
in
the
congressional
reference
bureau's
analysis
of
the
constitution...
thank
you,
your
honor.
