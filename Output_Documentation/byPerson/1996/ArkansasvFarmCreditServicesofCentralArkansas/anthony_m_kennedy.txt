justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
curious
to
know,
was
the
anti-injunction
act
point,
the
jurisdictional
point
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit...
pardon
me,
in
the
eighth
circuit
or
in
the
briefs
that
were
filed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
noticed
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
in
the
briefs
and
not
in
the
oral
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
the
congress
incorporates...
a
federal
corporation
has
a
federal
charter,
is
it
always
an
instrumentality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
should
have
asked,
and
it's
apparent
from
your
question,
they
are
not
always
designated
instrumentalities
apparently.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
clear
that
you
could
have
intervened
here
if
you
had
chosen
to
do
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
rule
24
you
have
an
interest?
