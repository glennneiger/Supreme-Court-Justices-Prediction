justice
stephen
g.
breyer
given
that,
why
isn't...
what's
wrong
with
arkansas'
approach?
i
mean,
her
approach
is
very
clear,
and
moreover,
all
it
say
is
that
congress
and
the
president,
who
signed
the
bill,
believe
that
state
tax
laws
are
pretty
important,
and
before
you
go
mucking
around
with
an
injunction,
go
into
state
court.
and
if
they're
important
enough
for
the
united
states,
namely
the
justice
department,
to
think
they're
that
important,
fine.
then
you
can
set
them
aside.
but
if
no
one
in
the
justice
department
thinks
they're
that
important,
that's
the
end
of
it.
okay,
then
you
can't.
go
into
state
court.
now,
that
would
be
a
very
clear
administrative
way
to
do
it,
it
would
be
simple,
and
i
don't
really
see
what
the
policy
is
underlying
this
that
would
be
seriously
interfered
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
does
he...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
hanson
suppose
you
were
to
say,
look,
if
it
is
a
matter
of
degree,
here
we
have
an
organization
that
looks
like
an
ordinary
bank,
performs
the
functions
of
ordinary
banks.
the
benefit
of
this
tax
exemption
or
immunity,
if
they
get
it,
will
go
entirely
to
private
shareholders
or
to
other
members
outside
the
government.
the
united
states
treasury
is
not
affected
by
a
penny--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
given
these
similarities
between
ordinary
banks
and
what's
going
on
here,
and
the
fact
that
the
treasury
is
not
implicated,
this
is
not
a
government
instrumentality
for
purposes
of
the
tax
injunction
act.
that
seems
to
track
the
kind
of
thing
that
judge
campbell
was
doing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
but
he
has
large
number
of
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
just
saying
look
at
the
similarities.
it
looks
like
a
bank,
acts
like
a
bank,
talks
like
a
bank,
et
cetera,
and
moreover
the
treasury
is
not
involved
to
the
tune
of
a
penny,
nor
is
the
member,
nor
are
the
taxpayers.
what's
at
issue
here
is
private
money
that
will
go
either
to
the
state
of
arkansas
or
to
private
shareholders
or
to
their
customers,
who
are
private
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
given
all
that,
we
don't
need
to
go
further.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's...
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
you
face
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
campbell
said,
if
we
go
into
that,
if
you
want
to,
he
says
they're
operated
in
furtherance
of
national
fiscal
policy,
not
operated
for
the
profit
of
shareholders,
do
not
provide
ordinary
commercial
banking
services,
act
as
depositories
for
money
held
in
the
united
states
treasury,
hold
the
legal
reserves
and
any
remaining
earnings
are
paid
into
the
surplus
fund
where
they
may
be
used
to
supplement
the
gold
reserve.
i
mean,
that
was
basically
his--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
most
of
those
things
seem
absent
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
there
aren't
private
shareholders
who
get
the
money
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see,
so
they
don't
get
a
profit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
might
try...
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
this
necessarily
seriously,
but
you
could
try
a
distinction
between
those
agencies
where
there
are
strong
reasons
for
independence
of
executive
authority,
the
fed,
for
example,
maybe
the
fcc
and
a
few
other
traditional
independent
ones,
and
those
agencies
where
the
proliferation
of
independent
legal
authority
to
control
their
own
cases
reflects
nothing
more
than
likely
administrative
convenience,
and
i
don't
know
that
that
kind
of
distinction
would
work.
it
would
be
difficult
to
apply,
but
so
is
the
distinctions
difficult
to
apply
in
the
absence
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
what's
difficult
is
congress
very
often
proliferates
litigating
authority
for
no
reason
other
than
the
general
counsel's
office
or
the
agency
would
like
it,
or
there
could
be
all
kinds
of
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
unlikely
congress
thought
about
this
part
when
they
did
that,
and
of
course
the
fed's
different.
it
absolutely
wanted
independence
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
how
it
works
across
the
banking
agencies.
that's
what
i
can't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
worries
me,
because
i
don't
know
about
how
many
instances
there
are
in
borderline
cases
where
you
never
have
to
reach
the
issue
because
congress
has
said
we
give
this
the
power
to
sue
and
be
sued,
and
if
we
suddenly
took
an
eleventh
amendment
test,
i'd
worry
that
all
of
a
sudden
we
had
to
decide
those
things
that
otherwise
never
had
to
be
decided--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
are
difficult.
i'm
not
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
putting
that
forward.
