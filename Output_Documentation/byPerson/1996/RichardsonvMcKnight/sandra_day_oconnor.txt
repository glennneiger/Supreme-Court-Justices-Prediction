justice

o'connor
and
no
good
faith
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
just
say
that
liability
under
section
1983
ought
to
go
hand-in-hand
with
a
qualified
immunity
defense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
has
some
relevance,
though,
here,
and
the
question
is,
are
we
just
going
to
apply
that
notion
in
this
context?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
probably
for
attorney's
fees,
don't
you
suppose?
we're
arguing
about
attorney's
fees
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
take
it
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
quite
take
your
approach
here,
because
as
i
read
the
brief,
would
advocate
that
qualified
immunity
be
recognized
for
some
private
contractors.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
still
costs
money
to
come
all
the
way
up
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court
and
fight
some
issue
on
qualified
immunity.
this
doesn't
come
cheaply.
you
have
to
have
lawyers
go
in,
assert
it,
get
it...
it's
expensive,
and
it
is
in
the
economic
interests
of
the
private
contractor
to
avoid
even
that.
they
will
make
more
money
if
they
aren't
dragged
into
court
at
all,
so
they
have
every
economic
incentive
to
behave
in
ways
that
will
keep
them
out
of
court,
period,
don't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
i
don't
know.
it
goes
to
me
to
the
balance
that
you
weigh
here,
what
our
concerns
are.
i
think
they
do
have
an
economic
incentive
to
behave
in
ways
that
won't
get
them
even
as
far
as
a
qualified
immunity
issue.
