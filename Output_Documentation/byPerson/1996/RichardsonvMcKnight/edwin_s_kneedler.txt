mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
guards
employed
by
a
private
corporation
that
is
operating
a
prison
pursuant
to
a
contract
with
the
state
for
the
operation
of
that
prison
are
not
entitled
to
invoke
qualified
immunity
under
section
1983
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
are
performing
functions
that
are
similar
to
those
performed
by
a
publicly
employed
guard.
however,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
there
are
other
circumstances
not
present
in
this
case
in
which
we
do
believe
that
private
persons
should
be
entitled
to
invoke
immunity.
some
of
those
have
been
referred
to
here,
and
some
of
them
in
fact
have
distinct
common
law
antecedents.
there
are...
there's
a
common
law
recognition,
for
example,
for
private
judicial
activities
in
the
area
of
arbitration.
there
are
common
law
antecedents
for
private
citizens
helping
to
find...
to
capture
fleeing
felons.
there
are
common
law
antecedents
for
immunities
for
informants
and
other
volunteers,
such
as
volunteer
fire
companies.
where...
in
situations
where
the
government
cannot
get
the
assistance
of
private
persons
in
the
performance
of
public
functions,
the
law
has
long
recognized
immunities
or
defenses,
and
we
think
in
those
circumstances
that
correspondingly
under
1983,
or
bivens,
when
a
person
is
acting
under
color
of
law,
that
there
would
be
also
a
basis
for
doing
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
there
are
really
two
questions,
and
that
is
whether
the
private
corporation
would
be
able
to
attract
employees
to
serve
as
their
guards,
but
then
beyond
that
the
question
would
be
whether
the
state
could
accomplish
the
function
of
housing
prisoners
if
that
weren't
so.
and
we
know
from
history
that
the
states
have
operated
prisons
themselves
and
have
been
able
to
hire
employees
and
attract
employees
and
give
them
the
security
of
their
job.
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
functions
of
qualified
immunity
in
the
public
sector.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
my
understanding
is
that
that
is,
that
that
distinction
does
exist
in
tort
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for
government
officials...
and
this
is
really
the
issue
in
this
court's
decision
in
westfall,
which
dealt
with
the
qualified
immunity
of
federal
employees
from
state
common
law
torts.
the
court
there
referred
to
the
fact
that
at
common
law
employees
were
absolutely
immune,
essentially
for
acts
performed
within
the
scope
of
their
discretion,
and
the
restatement
of
torts
refers
to
that
same
immunity
for
public
officials
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
discretion.
there
is
no
comparable
immunity
as
such
for
private--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
private
persons.
now,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
law
dealing
specifically
with
contracting
out,
but
i
see
no
reason
why
contracts
awarded
to
a
private
corporation
for
service
contracts
in
this
case,
or
procurement
contracts,
either
way
i
see
no
reason
why
a
private
corporation
in
its
ordinary
functions,
whether
it's
performing
a
contract
for
another
private
person
or
the
government,
would
not
be
subject
to
the...
as
a
general
rule,
the
same
rule,
that
there
would
not
be
a
comparable
immunity.
now,
there
may
be
defenses
at
common
law,
and
for
example,
there
are
privileges
or
defenses...
these
things
had
different
labels
at
common
law
for...
and
i'm
sure
the
guards
here
would
have
a
defense,
even
a
private
person
would,
in
assisting
in
an
arrest,
and
i'm
sure
that
there
would
be
a
good
faith
defense
recognized
at
common
law
in
tennessee...
not
an
immunity,
but
a
defense
in
terms
of
the
force
that
was
reasonably
believed
to
be
necessary
by
a
guard
to
restrain
someone.
that
would
be
a
privileged
battery,
and
the
question
would
be
whether
the
battery
would
be...
was
reasonable.
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no.
i
was
explaining
the
general
common
law
rule
of
torts
that
the
absolute
immunity
for
government
actors
did
not
apply
in
the
private
sector,
but
even
under
the
common
law
there
were--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
i
think
that
there
is
some
parallel
as
justice
breyer
was
suggesting
in
the
tort
law
to
support
a
distinction
between
people
who
are
public
employees
and
people
who
are
employees
of
private
corporations,
but
even
under
contracts,
i
do
want
to
make
one
important
point.
if
a
person
operating
under
a
contract
is
acting
pursuant
to
a
specific
governmental
directive,
either
in
the
contract
that
something
shall
be
done
in
a
certain
way,
or
directives
in
a
particular
case
that
something
shall
be
done
in
a
certain
way,
we
believe
that
qualified
immunity
should
attach
to
that,
because
in
that
situation
it
is
not
the
private
actor
but
the
government
that
is
really
accountable
for
that,
and
the
government
agent
or
official
who
made
that
decision
has
been
responsible
for
balancing
the
costs
and
benefits
of
doing
that.
i
do
think
that
there
is
an
important
distinction,
both
as
a
matter
of
history,
constitutional
law,
and
common
sense,
between
government
and
private
corporations,
between
the
government
way
of
doing
things,
or
the
government
model,
and
the
private
market
model.
for
one
thing,
article
vi
of
the
constitution
requires
every
executive
officer
of
a
state,
of
the
state
or
federal
government
to
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution,
and
those
heads
of
executive
departments,
including
the
state
correctional
department,
have
direct
responsibility
and
political
accountability
for
those
who
work
for
them.
in
that
climate
it
is...
i
think
the
courts
have
been
willing
to
assume
the
regularity
of
governmental
operations.
government
officials
will
be
trained,
but
in
any
event
they
will
be
subject
to
direct
political
accountability.
when
a
function
is
being
performed
by
a
private
contractor,
the
government
can't
step
in
and
correct--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
electorate
and
public
attention,
public
scrutiny
on
the
acts
of
public
officials.
that's
not
to
say
that
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
there
wouldn't
be
less
media
attention,
but
i
believe
it
may
be
that
the
public
would
hold
the
public
warden
or
correctional
superintendent
more
directly
responsible
for
what
happened,
and
perhaps
properly
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
the
direct
supervision
of
the
guards
on
a
day-to-day
basis,
anyway,
is
not
the
responsibility
of
the
head
of
the
correctional
department.
the
government
has
turned
over
as
a
package
the
entire
operation
of
the
prison,
and
there
are
a
series
of
financial
and
other
incentives
for
the
contractor
to
both
protect
the
security
of
the
prison
and
protect
private
rights.
that
includes
not
just
what
happens
in
individual
guard
decisions
but
the
broader
questions.
the
contractor
has
to
decide,
the
training,
the
security
measures,
the
way
facilities
are
designed,
the
programs,
all
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
no
responsibility,
but
we
do
believe
that
it's
attenuated
and
that
in
fact
there's
a
pretty
important
break
in
the
chain
of
control.
the
very
act
of
contracting
over
the
operation
of
an
entire
institution...
we're
not
talking
about
individual
doctors
who
may
be
integrated
into
what's
otherwise
a
governmental
institution,
but
turning
over
the
operation
of
an
entire
institution
to
a
private
corporation.
the
model,
then,
would
be
that
that
private
corporation,
using
whatever
it
believes
would
best
promote
the
overall
performance
of
the
contract,
to
use
its
creativity,
to
use
its
financial
resources
in
a
way
that
will
both
win
the
contract
the
next
time
around
and
also
to
guard
against
constitutional
rights,
and
the
government...
i
think
this
court
has
been
willing
to
assume
that
the
accountability
and
the
direct
responsibility
of
the
constitution
will
help
to
deter
constitutional
violations.
i
think
that
there's
less
structural
basis...
i'm
not
saying
necessarily
empirical,
but
structural
basis
for
concluding
that
the
same
assumption
should
not
be
applied
in
the
case
of
private
contractors,
but
we
do
urge
this
court
not
to
announce
a
rule
that
would
say
that
immunity
is
not
available
in
any
case
of
private
actors,
but
only
in
the
government
contractor
situation.
