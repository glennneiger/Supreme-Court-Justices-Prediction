mr.
ray,
would
you
put
together
the
theory
and
the
fact
for
me,
because
just
looking
at
what
is
alleged
here,
what
would...
how
would
it
not
be
clearly
established
that
it's
a
violation
to
take
someone
who
was
over
300
pounds
and
put
them
in
these
tight
restraints
that
are
bound
to
cause
extreme
pain?
we
are
talking
about
qualified
immunity
and
would
a
reasonable
officer
understand
from
the
clearly
established
law
that
you
don't
do
this.
that
is
my
problem
with
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
the
defense?
what
would
be
the
defense
for
these
allegations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
it's
an
academic
question,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--oh,
but
i'm
talking
about
in
the
context
of
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
i
asked
you
is,
what
good
would
qualified
immunity
do
them
if
they
had
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
cases
on
down
the
road.
in
this
case.
i
mean,
we
do
have
to
have
a
live
case,
or
a
real
case
or
controversy,
so
if
you
prevail,
what
good
would
that
do
to
these
parties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
make
the
argument
for
them
when
you're
saying,
now
i
have
the
benefit
of
this
qualified
immunity
defense,
so,
district
court,
they
are
qualified
immune,
and
so
the
district
court
goes,
tell
me
what
wasn't
clearly
established
in
relation
to
these
facts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i'd
just
like
you
to
tell
me,
suppose
he
had
qualified
immunity.
what
could
he
do
with
it?
he
could
try
to
prove
his
actions
were
objectively
reasonable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
sixth
circuit
suggested
that
there
might
be
another
standard
short
of
qualified
immunity
and
said
maybe
good
faith--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
would
extend
that
to
all
contracting
out
to
do
a
custodial
job?
say,
you'd
apply
the
same
thing
to
day
care
centers,
that
all
the
employees
of
the
contracting...
of
the
government
contractor
would
have
qualified
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
education,
and
the
government
saying
our
own
schools
are
rotten
so
we're
going
to
contract
out
that
function
to
a
private
company
that's
going
to
do
it
for
money?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would
those,
the
employees
that
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wasn't
talking
about
a
private
school.
i
was
talking
about,
it's...
the
state
has
been
running
these
day
care
centers
and
they
haven't
worked
out
very
well,
so
the
state
decides
it,
not
parents
paying
tuition
to
a
private
school,
but
the
state
is
going
to
replace
its
own
operation
with
a
contracting-out
arrangement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
head
of
the
operation
were
a
state
official...
let's
take
a
volunteer
fire
department,
where
the
fire
chief
is
a
public
employee.
everybody
else
is
a
private
citizen.
what
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
on
how
you
treat
the
doctors
who
have
a
contract
to
attend
to
all
the
inmates
who
get
sick?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ray,
it
wasn't
quite
that
way,
because
they
said
the
person
who
is
helping
out
in
the
u.s.
marshalls
service,
they
have
to
get
temporary
people
in
the
marshalls
service.
i
don't
think
they're
talking
about
elite
people
in
that
regard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
said
that
was
just
down
the
road,
when
we
opened
this
discussion.
