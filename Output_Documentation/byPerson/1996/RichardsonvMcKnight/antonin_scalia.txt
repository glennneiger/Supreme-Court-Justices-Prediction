justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
ray,
they
do
historically
provide
a...
provide
what
was
historically
a
governmental
function,
but
have
they
historically
had
such
immunity?
i
mean,
we
said
in
our
earlier
cases
that
this
qualified
immunity
is
a
matter...
it's
not
in
the
statute,
but
we
say
that
it
came
along
with
the
history
of
the
statute.
that
was
simply
what
existed
when
this
statute
was
passed,
and
therefore
we
think
it
exists
today.
now,
have
you
given
us
any
evidence
that
a
private
individual
not
employed
by
the
state
has
ever
been
given
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
anybody
historically,
even
if
you
could
come
up
with
a
medical
officer
who
was
privately
contracted
for
who
somehow
was
given
immunity,
or
a
private
policeman.
anything.
i
don't
know
that
you've
shown
even
one
example
of
this
historical
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
good
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
no
qualified
immunity
defense
under
state
law,
you
say.
not
for
the
private
person
but
for
the
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say,
look,
this
is
an
extraordinary
exception,
that
you
hurt
somebody
and
you're
not
liable.
you
have
this
qualified
immunity.
we
want
to
limit
it
to
those
functions
that
are
really
core
government
functions,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
regardless
of
whether
it
used
to
be
a
core
government
function,
the
government
isn't
that
serious
about
the
function
if
it's
willing
to
farm
it
out.
why,
just
as
a
means
of
keeping
the
governments
honest,
don't
we
say,
if
you're
really
serious
that
this
is
core
government
functions,
you
want
this
qualified
immunity,
you
have
to
have
your
own
people
doing
it.
you
can't
farm
it
out
to
private
individuals.
if
you're
that
concerned
about
it,
you'd
exercise
master-servant
supervision
over
what's
going
on.
this
state
hasn't,
so
the
state
doesn't
care
that
much,
so
why
should
we
give
qualified
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
don't
want
to
have
to
look
into
this
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
a
general
rule
of
law,
and
why
shouldn't
the
general
rule
of
law
be,
look,
if
you're
as
much
in
control
of
it
that
it's
your
own
servants
who
are
doing
the
thing,
then
we'll
consider
qualified
immunity,
but
if
you're
insouciant
enough
to
farm
it
out,
whatever
controls
you
put,
we're
not
going
to
give
qualified
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ray,
i
assume
if
that's
a
problem
for
the
private
contractor
officer,
i
suppose
it's
also
a
problem
for
the
state-employed
officer.
he
can
be
sued
under
state
tort
law,
can't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
have
qualified
immunity
under
state
tort
law?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
does,
your
argument
would
be
the
state
should
make
the
same
extension
to
contractors
that
you're
asking
the
federal
government
to
under
1983.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
has
chosen
not
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
bring
an
individual
suit
against
a
correctional
officer
who
has
beaten
you
up,
just
a
tort
suit?
i'm
not
suing
the
state.
i'm
suing
this
individual.
i'm
saying,
you
know,
this
is
a
bad
guy
who
has
hurt
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
vladeck,
can
you
say
for
sure
that
immunity
was
never
extended
to
nonemployees
of
the
state?
i
mean,
the
example
brought
forward
by
mr.
ray
is
an
impressive
one.
that
is,
it
certainly
was
the
tradition
at
common
law,
and
it
still
is
the
practice
in
england
to
have
prosecutions
conducted
by
barristers
hired
by
the
crown.
i
expect
that
was
the
case
in
the
early
days
in
this
country.
did
those
private
prosecutors
not
have
any
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
for
sure
that...
you
know
for
sure--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
prosecutors
at
common
law,
private
barristers
who
prosecuted
on
behalf
of
the
crown,
had
no
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't,
either,
but
i
would
be
surprised
if
they
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
was
there
any
question
about
whether,
in
any
of
those
cases
about...
i
mean,
weren't
they
the
most
outrageous
violations
of
law,
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
of
whether
the
law
was
clear
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
if
the
immunity
question
wasn't
even
involved
in
the
case
they're
not
very
good
authority.
everybody
agrees
you
can
sue
these
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
existence
of
suits
doesn't
prove
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure
they
have.
their
historical
antecedent
is,
their
argument
goes
like
this.
what
counts
is
the
function.
there
is
plenty
of
historical
antecedent
for
this
person
performing
this
function
to
be
given
immunity.
it's
plenty.
and
your
response
is,
well,
performing
the
same
function,
but
he
wasn't
employed
by
the
state,
and
i...
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
good
rebuttal
argument,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
they
haven't
brought
forward
any
historical
antecedent.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
because
they
were
private
employees--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
because
they
were
stupid
or
mean
or
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
something
inherent
in
the
nature
of
private
employees
that
would
have
made
them
the
stupid
ones
rather
than
the...
i
don't
see
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
think
that
these
employees
have
the...
i
mean,
they're
wonderful
employees
if
they
have
the
financial
well-being
of
the
corporation
so
much
in
mind
that
they
know
that
by
whipping
this
prisoner
along
a
little
bit
faster
the
corporation
is
going
to
make
more
money
and
that
makes
them
feel
good?
i
can't
imagine
that
that's
in
their
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
that
that
isn't
one
of
those
situations?
that
is
to
say,
do
we
know
that
private
companies,
deep
pockets,
apparently,
do
not
have
the
sovereign
immunity
that
the
state
has
and
who
are
liable,
you
know,
for
vicarious
master-servant
liability
for
their
individual
functionaries,
is
it
clear
that
they
would
take
on
these
contracts
and
perform
that
governmental
function
if,
indeed,
they
didn't
have
comparable
qualified
immunity
to
the
one
that
the
government
s
own
prison
guards--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
kneedler,
you've
confused
me
now.
i
thought
when
you
began
you
acknowledged
that
there
were
some
instances
in
which
qualified
immunity
was
given
to
private
people
where
you
said
it
was
necessary
to
call
for
the
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you're
just...
i
thought
you're
just
saying
now
that
there
aren't
any
instances.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
qualified
immunity
here,
though.
we're
not
talking
about
absolute--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you'd
better
be
very
careful
in
picking
the
contractor.
it
seems
to
me
you
can
get
just
as
mad
at
the
state
governmental
corrections
director
for
being
very
negligent
in
his
selection
of
contractors
as
you
can
get
mad
at
him
for
being
negligent
in
his
supervision
of
people
who--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
contract
says
that
in
so
many
words,
don't
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
any
prisoners,
or
just...
it
says
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
clause
subject
to
the
qualified
immunity
defense?
you
may
end
up
having
a
defense
against
a
tort
suit
but
you
lose
the
contract
because
you've
violated
their
constitutional
rights,
qualified
immunity
or
not.
that's
a
real
box
you're
in.
