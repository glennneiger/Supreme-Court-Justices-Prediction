mr.
david
c.
vladeck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
damage
action
brought
pursuant
to
section
1983,
and
that
provision
broadly
imposes
liability
on
any
and
every
person
who,
acting
under
the
color
of
state
law,
deprives
a
person
of
constitutional
rights.
it
contains
no
explicit
immunities
or
exceptions.
and
nonetheless,
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
congress
enacted
the
civil
rights
act
back
in
1871,
it
did
not
intend
to
abrogate
wholesale
the
immunities
that
existed
at
that
time.
rather,
this
court
has
said,
and
it
has
said
it
as
recently
as
wyatt
v.
cole,
that
it
will
recognize
immunities
where,
but
only
where,
two
conditions
are
met.
first,
that
there
is
some
firm
historical
antecedent
for
the
immunity,
and
second
that
there
are
strong
policy
considerations
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
section
1983
that
preserve
the
preservation
of
the
immunity,
and
both
conditions
need
be
met.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
though
the
court
has,
even
in
cases
that
post
date
harlow,
always
looked
at
the
historical
basis.
the
only--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
function,
performed
by
state
officials
subject
to
the
constraints
that
normally
apply
to
state
actors,
and--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--the
only
case
of
this
court
that
addresses
that
issue
is
tower
v.
glover,
which
involved
not
a
prosecutor
but
a
public
defendant,
and
this
court,
relying
both
on
history
and
public
policy
grounds,
held
that
that...
that
person
was
not
entitled
to
the
immunity
that
was
sought
in
that
case.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
judicial
immunity
is
a
different
branch
of
sovereign
immunity
than
the
immunity
that
we're
speaking
of
here
today,
and
that
gets
back
to
my
fundamental
point,
which
is
that
there
is
no
historical
antecedent
for
immunity
at
common
law
for
nongovernmental
actors,
particularly
in
torts
involving
the
abuse
of
government
power.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--i
do
not
know
that
for
sure.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
the
only
discussion
of
that
issue
i've
seen
in
this
court's
case
is
in
tower
v.
glover.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
think
that
is
very
different.
i
do
not
know
whether
those
parties
had
immunity.
the
only
historical
evidence
we
have
here
is
in
the
brief
of
the
aclu,
which
looks
at
the
practice
that
existed
in
the
turn
of
the
century
for
privatized
prisons.
private
prisons
were
common
in
the
late
1800's,
and
there
are
cases
from
that
time
involving
private
jailers
who
engaged
in
tortious
conduct
and
they
are
not
afforded
immunity.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor,
some
are
state
tort
law
cases.
other
are
federal
cases
brought
in
federal
court.
the
reported
decisions
do
not
state
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
so
i
do
not...
i
can't
tell
you
for
a
fact
that
these
were
1983
cases.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
i--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--no.
the
question
that
this
court
has
looked
to
in
every
single
case
involving
the
question
of
whether
an
individual
is
entitled
to
immunity
has
looked
first
at
the
question
of
is
there
historical
antecedent,
and
the
burden
on
showing
historical
antecedent
has
always
been
placed
on
the
proponents
of
the
immunity.
this
court
has
ruled
again
and
again
that
because
immunities
interfere
with
the
enforcement
of
constitutional
rights,
the
burden
is
on
the
proponent
to
explain
both
the
historical
basis
and
public
policy
arguments
that
support
it.
the
petitioners
have
never
argued
that
there's
a
historical
antecedent.
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
this--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
it
is
true
that
in
common
law
government
prison
guards
had
immunity,
or
had
a
defense
that
is
now
called
an
immunity,
but
there
were...
there
was
quite
an
extensive
experience
with
private
prisons,
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
of
those
actors
were
ever
accorded
immunity
either
in
our
jurisprudence
or
in
the
english
jurisprudence.
and
to
the
extent
that
people
have
looked
at
it,
the
cases
that
exist...
and
i
agree,
they're
not
perfect
on
this,
but
do
not
accord
private
actors
immunity.
but
in
any
event,
the
policy
considerations
that
i
think
are
germane
here
argue
very
strongly
against
giving
governmental
immunity
to
private
actors.
our
main
reason
is
this.
placing
governmental
power
in
the
hands
of
private
actors
is
bound
to
increase
the
risk
of
constitutional
torts,
and
i
say
that
because
the
key
constraints...
qualified
immunity
is
a
tradeoff.
on
one
hand
we
accept
the
fact
that
there
will
be
unremedied
and
undeterred
violations
of
law
because
we
find
it
necessary
for
government
to
perform
those
functions.
it
is
an
altogether
different
matter
when
we
are
transforming
government
power
to
private
actors
who
may
operate
in
very
different
ways
with
very
different
incentives.
for
example,
here,
the
prison
is
being
run
by
a
for-profit
corporation.
corporate...
corporations,
including
prison
corporations,
have
a
duty
to
maximize
their
profits.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
they
have
a
motive
to
avoid
paying
damages
if
there's
something
in
place
to
keep
that
motivation
present.
the
problem
with
qualified
immunity
is
it
removes
the
deterrence
to
do
precisely
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
the
easiest
way--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--it
is
for
two
reasons.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
my
first
answer,
justice
breyer,
is,
if
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
then
the
decision
should
be
made
by
congress,
not
this
court,
because
unless
it
is
clear
that
the
risks
of
conferring
qualified
immunity
are
not
substantial
and
will
not
do
violence
to
the
policies
in
1983,
this
court
has
always
said
we
ought
not
to
proceed.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
because
the
court
has
said,
in
cases
like
harlow,
that
in
addition
to
whatever
economic
incentives
that
you're
basing
your
question
on,
there
are
other
constraints
that
operate
on
public
officials
that
certainly
are
absent
here.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
in
harlow,
of
course...
excuse
me.
in
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
the
court
was
talking
about
political
accountability,
and
those
constraints
operate
on
public
employees
in
a
very
real
and
very
immediate
way.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
think
money
is
a
restraint.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
they
are...
they
work
in
a
very
hierarchical,
civil
service
system.
they
give
oaths
of
office.
they
are
subject
to--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--no,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that,
but
our
point
is
not
solely
that
the
motivations
of
prison
guards...
here,
of
course,
they're
not
simply
prison
guards.
they're
shareholders
of
the
corporation
for
which
they
work.
it's
not
simply
their
motivation.
it's
they
work
within
a
structure.
it
is
the
nature
of
the
employer
that
is
significant,
and
here--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--i
still
think...
i
think
there's
a
continuum
along
which
greater
state
control
may
be
an
element,
but
as
long
as
there's
a
divided
loyalty
problem
like
you
have
here,
where
the
correctional
officers
serve
two
masters,
not
one...
they
serve
the
shareholders
as
well
as
the
state...
you
have
problems
of
constitutional
violations.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
there
is
supervision,
biennial
supervision
by
certain
of
the
committees
of
the
tennessee
legislature.
that,
of
course,
is
much
more
sporadic
than
the
kind
of
public
oversight
that
ordinarily
obtains
with
public
entities.
but
when
this
legislation
was
passed,
the
one
principal
reservation
was
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee,
who
said...
and
this
is
obviously
a
paraphrase,
but
our
concern
is
that
suppose
something
goes
wrong
with
this
contract.
it
is
very
difficult
to
substitute
a
new
provider,
if
you
will,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment,
and
so
in
some
sense
we
are
locked
in
and
we're
stuck
with
the
contractor
that
we....
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that
is
correct,
and
there
is
some
oversight,
but
that
is
very
different
than
the
day-to-day
public
accountability
that
we
presume
constrains
the
activities
of
our
public
officials.
that
was
part
of
the--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--i
think
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
but
to
the
extent
that
a
clear
line
could
be
discerned
in
the
government's
brief,
i
think
they
point
to
the
same
two
factors
that
we
do.
one
is
the
lack
of
divided
loyalty.
in
all
of
the
hypotheticals
that
are
given
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
the
contractor
owes
its...
or
his
or
her
loyalty
to
the
government,
and
the
second
portion
of
their
test,
as
i
understand
it,
is
direct
and
active
governmental
supervision.
neither
of
those
factors
are
present
here.
this
is
a
classic
turnkey
operation
in
which
the
state
has
essentially
given
over
to
cca,
the
corrections
corporation
of
america,
the
responsibility
for
the
day-to-day
operations
of
this
prison.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
in
part
i'm
relying
on
what
this
court
has
said
in
its
prior
immunity
cases.
these
are
not
my
own
views.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
economic
incentives,
the
provision
of
qualified
immunity
is
the
wrong
way
to
go
about
enforcing
compliance
with
the
civil
rights
laws.
if
you're
simply
looking
at
it
dollars
and
cents,
qualified
immunity
will
save
the
corrections
corporation
of
america,
assuming
that
it
indemnifies
its
employees
and
pays
for
their
litigation
expenses,
an
enormous
amount
of
money,
and
removes
the
incentives--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
that...
that
may
be
so,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--but
if
that
is
the
case,
then
their
plea
is
misdirected.
they
ought
to
go
to
congress
and
make
that
argument,
where
congress
can
engage
in
the
kind
of
fact
determinations
that
this
court
has
said
in
the
past--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--let's
take
this
case,
for
example.
here,
when
the
prisoner
was
transported
to
south
central
correctional
facility
the
original
transportation
was
done
by
state
correctional
officers.
they
recognized
because
of
his
bulk,
and
because
of
his
size,
they
ought
to
take
the
ankle
shackles
and
put
them
on
his
wrists,
leaving
his
ankles
unshackled,
and
when
the
transfer
was
made
the
state
correctional
officers
told
the
cca
employees
that
this
is
the
way
he
ought
to
be
handled.
the
cca
employees
ignored
that
and
shackled
both
his
wrists
and
his
legs,
leading
to
his
injuries.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
no,
i--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--it
could
have
been
all--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--i
didn't
finish,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
let
me
try
to
respond
directly
to
your
question.
the
transportation
of
prisoners
is
done
at
a
flat
fee.
the
better
you
do
it,
the
more
personnel
you
do
it,
you're
not
going
to
make
any
more
money,
and
the
problem
that
this
case
presents
is,
there's
inevitably
a
tension...
when
it
comes
to
spending
money
or
safeguarding
prisoners'
rights,
there's
inevitably
a
tension
here,
and
here,
i
submit--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--i
don't
divorce
the
employees
from
the
context
in
which
they
work,
and
here
what
i'm
saying
is
that
because
corporations
have
a
duty
to
their
shareholders
to
maximize
their
profits,
that
puts
the
needs
of
the
corporation
potentially
on
a
collision
course
with
the
constitutional
rights
of
their
employees,
and
that
is
the
danger
of
giving
qualified
immunity
to
private
actors
who
are
not
subject--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
one
of
the
principal
goals
of
section
1983
is
to
deter
civil
rights
violations.
that's
why...
part
of
the
reason
why
it
was
enacted,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
put
governmental
power
in
the
hands
of
private
actors
who
are
not
subject
to
the
constraints
that
we
normally
think
inhibit
unconstitutional
acts
by
government
officials,
that
is
a
very
risky
proposition
that
counsels
against
extending
qualified
immunity
to
private
persons
here.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
do
not
know
whether
there's
any
common
law
basis
for
affording
those
kinds
of
contractors
who
work
within
the
governmental
structure
as
it
exists,
who
take
supervision
and
direction
and
control
from
governmental
prison
officials,
whether
they
have
been
accorded
immunity
in
the
past.
but
i
would
urge
the
court
to
retain
the
historic
first
question
that
is
always
asked
in
qualified
immunity
cases,
which
is
simply--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--thank
you.
