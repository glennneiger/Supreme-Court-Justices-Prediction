h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-318,
daryll
richardson
and
john
walker
v.
mcknight.
mr.
ray,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
want
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
sixth
circuit
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
that
qualified
immunity
wasn't
available
to
private
contractors.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that's
why
we've
got
it
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wood
v.
strickland
was
a
school
board,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he'd
have
to--
--so
you're
not
trying
to
impose
liability
on
the
state?
you're
just
trying
to
sue
the
individual?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ray.
mr.
vladeck,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is...
you're
not
talking
about
1983
cases,
i
take
it,
but
just
state
tort
law
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
have
been
diversity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
they
also
have
a
very
strong
motive
to
avoid
paying
a
lot
of
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
kind
of
public
accountability
do
state-paid
prison
guards
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
intimations
in
your
brief
that
the
public
employees
kind
of
do
it
as
a
labor
of
love,
and
that
may
be
true
at
some
levels,
but
certainly
not
at
the
prison
guard
level.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
just
from
my
own
experience
in
private
practice,
private
concerns
are
much
more
cost-conscious
and
willing
to
settle
and
willing
to
avoid
liability
than
governments,
which
traditionally
feel
as
i
gather,
that
you
know,
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
how
much
this
is
costing
us
because
we've
got
a
principle
at
stake.
i
think
your
argument
really
proves
the
other
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
vladeck.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--when
you
say
political
accountability
you
mean
the
electorate,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that...
do
you
think
there
would
be
less,
say,
media
attention
on
a
prison
riot
if
the...
if
prison
officials
and
the
workers
were
contract
prisoners
than
if
they
were
government
employees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
on
earth
would
that
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
ray,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ray.
the
case
is
submitted.
