but
isn't
it
also
true
that
we've
often
said
that
the
scope
of
the
immunity
is
measured
by
the
function
being
performed
by
the
defendant
in
the
office
he
held,
and
the
function
being
performed
by
these
private
companies
is
precisely
the
same
as
a
public
function.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
history
is
that
this
function
is
one
that
has
been
entitled
to...
has
generated
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
even
in
england,
isn't
it
true
that
the
hue
and
cry
that
was
raised
to
chase
the
fleeing
felon
often
enlisted
the
help
of
all
sorts
of
private
citizens
in
performing
police
functions
in
apprehending
fleeing
felons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
if
that's
the
ultimate
goal.
the
statute
is...
was
enacted
to
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
people
from
violation
by
state
officials,
and
in
your
hypothesis,
you've
got
a
constitutional
violation
here,
but
it
should
go
unredressed
because
of
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
need
the
defense
unless
there's
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
qualified
immunity
attaches
even
though
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
