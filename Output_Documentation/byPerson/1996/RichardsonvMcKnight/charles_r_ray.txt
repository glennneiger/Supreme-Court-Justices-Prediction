mr.
charles
r.
ray
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
correctional
officers
who
are
employed
by
a
private
concern,
who
perform
traditional
and
historical
police
power
functions,
and
act
under
the
color
of
law
for
1983
purposes,
should
have
the
benefit
of
qualified
immunity.
firstly,
we
would
like
to
put
forth
the
proposition
that
should
this
court
extend
qualified
immunity
to
correctional
officers
of
this
nature,
that
the
floodgates
will
not
open,
and
qualified
immunity
will
not
be
willy
nilly
conferred.
firstly,
there
are
thousands,
literally...
maybe
hundreds
of
thousands
of
contractors
who
contract
with
the
state
of
tennessee,
but
only
those
who
are
found
to
act
under
the
color
of
state
law
as
defined
by
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
jackson
v.
metropolitan
edison
would
be
needful
of
qualified
immunity.
secondly,
only
objectively
reasonable
actions
on
the
part
of
these
private
actors
would
give
rise
to
qualified
immunity.
of
course,
if
their
actions
are
not
objectively
reasonable
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
they
would
not
have
the
benefit
of
qualified
immunity.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
justice
ginsburg,
we
never
got
to
that
point,
and
that's
the
issue.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
well,
perhaps
under
woods
v.
strickland,
if
mr.
mcknight
can
establish
that
the
acts
of
our
officers
that
he
alleges
were
not
objectively
reasonable,
then
we
don't
have
benefit
of
qualified
immunity.
that
is
obvious.
but
the
district
court--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--oh,
that
question
is
not
academic,
in
that
there
are
literally
hundreds
of
vexatious
and
frivolous
lawsuits
filed--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--in
the
context
of
this
case,
mr.
mcknight
may
well
establish,
if
this
court
should
extend
qualified
immunity
to
correctional
officers
who
are
employed
by
private
concerns,
that
our
two
officers
don't
have
the
benefit.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
that's
why
it's
here.
duncan
v.
peck,
which
is
their
case--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--well,
in
cases
on
down
the
road
where
their
actions
were
objectively
reasonable
the
litigation--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--i
would
submit,
justice
ginsburg,
that
this
case
would
still
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
that
specific
finding,
that
their
actions
were
not
objectively
reasonable
and
they
don't
have
the
benefit
of
qualified
immunity.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
well,
the
specific
issue
before
this
court
is,
we
didn't
get
to
that
point.
the
district
court
said,
based
on
the
jurisprudence
of
manis
v.
corrections
corporation
of
america,
established
by
this
court,
you
don't
have
qualified
immunity,
mr.
ray.
you're
out
of
here.
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
again,
we
may
fail
on
that
issue,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
issue
before
this
court
and
what
we
want
decided
is
the
fact
that
qualified
immunity
should
be
extended
to
these
individuals
who
act
under
the
color
of
state
law
for
1983
purposes,
are
subjected
to
suit
on
a
day-by-day
basis,
and
they
perform
traditional
historical
police
powers
that
this
court
has
extended
qualified
immunity
to
their
public
counterparts
in
navarette.
so
we
would
submit
that
though
we
may
ultimately
not
prevail
on
that
question...
that
question
is
not
before
us
here...
the
question
is
whether
we
get
over
the
first
hurdle,
i.e.--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--the
good
faith
defense.
that's
correct.
but
the
good
faith
defense,
as
you
well
know,
justice
ginsburg,
still
allows
us
to
be
subjected
to
the
discovery
process.
to
discover
the
subjective
mind
set
of
my
clients
we
go
through
what
may
be
needless
and
extended
litigation,
expensive
litigation,
whereas
if
qualified
immunity
applies,
of
course,
that
ends
the
dispute
at
that
point.
so
i
would
submit
that
the
difference
between
a
good
faith
defense
and
qualified
immunity
is
quite,
quite
different,
and
the
benefits
that
would
be
conferred
not
on
my
two
petitioners,
but
on
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
who
would
not
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
litigating
what
may
turn
out
to
be
a
frivolous
and
vexatious
lawsuit...
which
again
this
court's
jurisprudence
from
harlow
ford
has
made
it
a
consideration
that
the
benefit
you
want
to
confer
is
not
on
the
actors,
but
upon
the
citizens,
who
will
benefit
from
not
having
their
officers,
who
perform
a
traditional
governmental
function
that
utilizes
a
great
deal
of
discretion,
from
being
impeded,
deterred,
made
timid
by
threat
of
litigation,
and
threatened
with
litigation.
so
we
would
submit
that
the
question
here
again
is
whether
you
confer
qualified
immunity
on
officers
who
historically
have
and
do
provide
a
fundamental
governmental
function.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
justice
scalia,
if
i
could
address
prison
guards
historically
in
the
state
of
tennessee--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--i
would
submit
that
historically
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
at
one
time
was
allowed
to
have
a
private
law
practice,
and
when
acting
in
his
official
function
for
the
government
that
i'm
sure
that
immunity
would
attach
to
him
in
any
official
acts.
in
england,
prior
to
1871,
when
this
particular
statute
was
promulgated,
lawyers
were
both
public
prosecutors
and
private
prosecutors,
and
when
they
were
acting
as
public
prosecutors
i
would
submit
that
immunity
attached
to
them.
those
are
the
only
examples
i
can
suggest,
but
let
me
state
that--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--pierson
v.
ray,
this
court
started
out
talking
about
a
good
faith
immunity,
which
ultimately
developed
over
the
course
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine.
pierson
v.
ray
dealt
with
police
officers
having
a
good
faith
defense
to
malicious
prosecution
actions.
in
tennessee,
pursuant
to
statute
tca
4-3-609,
correctional
officers
have
the
same
core
functions,
the
same
grant
of
power
as
police
officers
do.
they
have
the
right
to
bear
arms.
they
have
the
right
to
take
people
into
custody,
effectuate
search
and
seizures,
secure
their
facility
from
both
outside
invaders
or
quell
disturbances
inside.
so
i
would
submit
that
pierson
v.
ray...
i
think
it
was
footnote
7
where
mr.
justice
white
cited
ample
precedent
that
there
was
a
historical
basis
for
police
officers
having...
excuse
me.
that
was
navarette,
footnote
7,
that
correctional
officers
have
qualified
immunity.
given
the
historical
basis
in
tennessee
of
there
being
coextensive
powers
between
police
officers
and
correctional
officers,
i
would
submit
that
the
historical
basis
is
there.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
that's
correct.
justice
breyer.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
the...
if
i
may
answer
it
this
way,
justice
breyer,
the
public
correctional
officer,
sovereign
immunity
would
suffice
there.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
right.
but
you
would
go
through
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
the
answer
is
no,
there's
no--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--i
have
found
no
case,
but
i
would
submit
that
our
private
correctional
officers
do
not
have
the
benefit
of
sovereign
immunity
and
therefore
would
be
subject
to
tort
law
and
subject
to
being
sued
in
state
jurisdictions.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
he
must
pay
the
piper.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
no,
sir.
not
for
the
private
person.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
oh,
the
good
faith
defense
would
be
there,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
i
see
what
you're
driving
at,
justice
breyer,
and
i
still
believe
that
as
you've
stated
your
question
the
good
faith
defense
would
be
available
to
that
private
correctional
officer
but
not
in
the
context
of
having
any
sort
of
immunity.
it
would
just
be
a
common
law
defense
to...
i
acted
in
good...
just
as
if
a
private
security
guard
at
wal-mart
took
someone
into
custody
thinking
they
were
a
shoplifter
and
they
turned
out
not
to
be
a
shoplifter,
then
they're
subject
to
malicious
prose--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--i'll
try
to
address
those--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--justice
breyer.
number
1
is
without
question
that
we
act
under
color
of
state
law
and
are
amenable
to
suit
under
42
u.s.
section
1983
because
we
do
perform
those
core
governmental
functions
that
historically
and
traditionally
have
been
the
police
powers
of
the
state,
so
i
think
it's
not
questioned
by
anyone,
at
least
not
by
us,
that
we
are
amenable
to
suit
under
1983.
now
then,
the
second
question
becomes,
what
common
law
immunity
do
we
have
as
a
private
person?
i
would
submit
that
by
contract
the
state
of
tennessee
denied
us
sovereign
immunity
so
we
are
in
a
different
position
than
our
public
counterparts,
who
are
correctional
officers.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
common-sensical
approach,
and
i
recognize
that
wyatt
v.
cole
was
out
there
i
think
on
the
cutting
edge
of
1983
jurisprudence
in
that
the
court
found
that
there
was
color
of
law
and
amenable
to
suit
because
they
utilized
the
replevin
and
garnishment
statutes
and
went
on
to
find
that,
because
they
were
two
cattle
barons
in
a,
if
you
will,
spite
suit,
that
qualified
immunity
didn't
attach,
and
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
i
would
submit,
justice
o'connor,
that
where
a
private
actor
is
acting
under
the
color
of
law,
amenable
to
suit
under
1983,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
they
are
performing
a
core
governmental
function
that
traditionally
and
historically
has
been
part
of
the
police
power
of
the
state,
that
the
reasonable
approach
would
be
to
grant
them
qualified
immunity.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
justice
scalia,
i
beg
to
differ.
the
state
cares
a
great
deal.
the
state
has
on-site
a
functionaire
designated
as
a
liaison
who
oversees
on
a
day-to-day
basis
how
we
run
south
central
correctional
facility.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
justice
scalia,
i
submit
that
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
has
always
been
that
the
states
are
free,
as
the
hothouses
of
democracy,
the
laboratories
of
democracy,
if
you
will,
to
attempt
to
chart
their
own
course
in
how
they
delegate
the
duties,
how
they
go
about
doing
what
they
want
to
do.
if
the
state
of
tennessee
thinks
it
better
serves
its
citizens
to
contract
out
the
running
of
the
prisons,
then
that
is
an
issue
that's
left
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
now,
whether
this
court
wants
to
decide
an
immunity
question
on
that
basis
i
would
submit
that
that's
clearly
antithetical
to
what
this
court's
done
in
the
past.
that's
like
the
amici
arguing
that
you
should
consider
whether
or
not
insurance
comes
into
play,
or
whether
we
choose
to
indemnify
our
employees,
or
whether
we
choose
to
do...
to
give
bonuses,
et
cetera.
all
of
these
things
are
things
that
the
state
of
tennessee
has
taken
into
account
when
they
initially
decide
that
we're
going
to
contract
out
at
least
part
of
our
corrections
facilities
and
compare
whether
a
private
run
facility
can
operate
more
efficiently
to
be
to
the
taxpayer's
interest,
or
whether
we
should
keep
this
governmental
function
our
own,
and
i
submit
that
once
a
state
makes
that
decision,
that's
a
valid
and
legitimate
decision
the
state
has
a
right
to
make.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
believe
that
it
should
be
maintained
within
the
confines
of
this
existing...
of
this
court's
existing
jurisprudence.
since
procunier
v.
navarette
has
been
decided
that
state
prison
guards,
and
then
cleavinger
v.
saxner
federal
prison
guards
are...
have
the
right
to
have
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
applied
in
their
favor,
i
would
submit
that
it's
core
governmental
functions
of
that
nature--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--again,
i
think
that
would
be
a
legitimate
end
of
state
government
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
i
would
say
no,
because
this
court
has
never
extended
qualified
immunity
to
educational
facilities.
in
fact,
i
think
there's
one
case
dealing
with
a
contractor
who
provided
educational
service
to
the
prison
that
attempted
to
invoke
qualified
immunity
doctrine
which
was
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
that's
correct,
your
honor,
a
school
board,
but
again,
that
was
a
question
of
the
discretion
that
the
school
board
exercises
in
fulfilling
its
function,
and--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--mr.
justice
breyer,
i
would
think
that
the
acting
under
color
of
law
coofficial
would
be
missing
from
that
particular...
but--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--well,
again,
i
think
it
would
be
dependent
upon
the
amount
of
discretion
that
the
officers
utilized
in
furthering
the
public
good
and
what
this
court's
jurisprudence
had
been
in
the
past
about
conveying
qualified
immunity
to
actors
of
that
nature,
and
it
would
be
my
belief
that
in
the
example
you've
given,
justice
ginsburg,
that
qualified
immunity
would
not
attach
to
that
particular
function.
but
here
we
have
a
function
that
on
a
day-to-day
basis
i
can't
think
of
any
other
governmental
function
that
utilizes
as
much
discretion
in
dealing
with
a
populace
or
a
segment
of
the
population
that
this
court
has
recognized
where
there's
an
unremitting
tension
between
the
keepers
and
the
kept,
and
an
unremitting
tension
between
those
folks
that
are
being
confined
for
antisocial
behavior,
who
have
a
proclivity
to
make
use
of
the
court
system
in
some
cases
for
frivolous
and
vexatious
litigation,
and
that
it's
the
public
good
that
is
to
be
served
by
qualified
immunity.
it's
not
mr.
richardson
or
mr.
walker
that
the
benefit
is
meant
to
be
conferred
upon.
it's
the
belief
by
this
court
that
mr.
richardson
and
mr.
walker
should
have
the
right
to
carry
out
this
governmental
function
with
discretion,
without
timidity,
to
take
care
of
business
free
from
vexatious
and
frivolous
litigation.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
justice
breyer,
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
is
a
practical...
practical...
what
happens
in
the
real
life
out
there.
these
writ-writers
all
go
to
federal
court
under
1983,
for
whatever
reason.
the
state
court's
there
for
them.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
i
think
not,
justice
breyer.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
if
i
could
answer
that
question--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--well,
for
whatever
reason,
they
chose
not
to.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
well,
they've
chosen
not
to
grant
us
sovereign
immunity,
which
their
public
correction
officers
would
have
benefit
of.
what
that
means
is,
you
have...
your
suit
is
brought--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--it
would
be
my
belief
you
would
have
to
go
through
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
again,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--that's
correct,
justice
breyer,
and
as
elucidated
by
this
court
in
pierson
v.
ray,
the
analogy
to
the
good
faith
defense
that
a
police
officer
would
have
had
at
common
law
to
such
a
claim.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
there's
no
other
questions.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
promise
you
i
won't
use
that.
in
response
to
the
government,
i
really
submit
that
their
position
seems
to
be
a
bit
elitist,
that
doctors,
counselors,
those
professions
that
you're
going
to
have
difficulty
in
bringing
into
the
contracting
service
should
have
immunity,
qualified
immunity,
but
a
mere
prison
guard,
where
the
rubber
meets
the
road,
somehow
they
don't
warrant
qualified
immunity,
and
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--well,
again
i
would
submit
that
if
we're
going
to
have
qualified
immunity
for
these
types
of
people,
the
people
who
utilize
the
most
discretion
on
a
day-to-day
basis
and
need
it
the
most
are
correctional
officials.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
no
question
about
it.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
in
the
case
that
was
argued
yesterday
it
was
quite
apparent
that
insurance
played
a
great
role
in
that
particular
case.
the
county
had
insurance,
whether
or
not
it
was
enough.
so
governments
indemnify
their
employees
just
as
private
concerns
do,
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
let
that
particular
issue
decide
whether
qualified
immunity
would
pass
on
to
a
certain
governmental
official.
and
again,
since
harlow,
the
focus
i
would
submit
has
been
upon
what
the
public
interest
is
in
having
qualified
immunity
conferred
on
this
particular
governmental
official,
who
utilizes
discretion
on
a
daily
basis.
we
do
indemnify
our
guards,
but
eventually
that
cost
is
going
to
be
passed
on
to
the
state
of
tennessee,
and
eventually
passed
on
to
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
so
i
would
submit
that
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
serve
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
and
therefore
qualified
immunity
shouldn't
turn
on
whether
or
not
there's
indemnification
of
our
employees.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that's
not
our
policy
at
all.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
well,
if
our
actions
were
objectively
reasonable
under
the
standard
established
by
this
court,
then
qualified
immunity
attaches
to
it.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
but
again,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
richardson
and
mr.
walker
did
not
know
or
should
not
have
known
about
their
constitutional
deprivation
of
mr.
mcknight's
rights
in
order
for
them
to
have
the
benefit.
but
one
thing
i
do
want
to
point
out,
one
of
the
reasons--
mr.
charles
r.
ray
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that
question
has
not
been
decided
by
the
district
court,
the
sixth
circuit,
and
we
never
got
that
far.
but
in
response
to
one
of
mr.
justice
breyer's
questions
earlier,
one
of
the
specific
reasons
that
we
can
lose
this
contract
is
to
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
inmates
that
we
have
in
our
keep,
and
that
is
quite
evident
to
all
our
employees,
and
if
we
want
to
succeed
and
retain
this
contract,
then
we
have
to
proceed
down
a
straight
and
narrow
path
that
belies
the
parade
of
horribles
that
the
respondent
and
amici
have
raised.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
that's
one
of
the
provisions,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
that's
correct.
written
notice
given
for
a
number
of
reasons,
constitutional
deprivations
being
one
of
them,
mr.
justice
souter.
mr.
charles
r.
ray
i'm
assuming...
i've
been
known
to
put
myself
in
such
a
box
at
2:00
a.m.
in
the
morning
when
i
come
in,
mr.
justice
scalia,
but--
