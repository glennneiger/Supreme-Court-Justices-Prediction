justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
ordinary
tort
law?
that
is,
a
policeman
or
a
correctional
officer
working
for
the
government
puts
shackles
on
somebody,
or
hits
them
or
whatever.
that's
a
tort.
that's
a
battery.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
must
be
their...
state
officials,
some
kind
of
state
law
tort
immunity
that
gives
a
degree
of
leeway
to
a
state
officer
who
commits
the
battery
where
he
does
it
in
good
faith.
is
there
any
case,
anywhere
in
any
of
these
jurisdictions,
that
tells
us
in
respect
to
ordinary
tort
law
whether
a
private
correctional
official
is
treated
similarly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
a
suit
individually
against
the
officer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
sue
the
officer
individually,
there
will
be
some
kind
of
public-based,
not
immunity,
but
it
will
be
a
defense,
and
for
good
faith,
et
cetera,
and
i
just
wonder
if
there's
any
case
that
you've
come
across...
it
seems
to
me
by
now
it
should
have
come
across
somewhere...
ordinary,
garden
variety
tort
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
to
what
is
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
without
a
defense,
so
that
if
in
fact
he
commits
a
battery
by
putting
the
shackle
on,
it
is
a
defense
to
say
i
was
acting
according
to
law,
period.
but
if
it
turns
out
he
was
wrong
that
in
fact
there
are
too
many
shackles,
it's
a
battery.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
for
the
public
person,
yes.
the
question
is
whether
for
the
private
person,
if
it's
not
available
to
you
and
me
in
our
private
capacities
when
we
happen
to
go
out
as
a
joke
and
put
shackles
on
somebody...
not
much
of
a
joke,
but
do
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
you
want
to
comment
on
this,
but
where
i'm
having
trouble
with
this
case,
and
why
i
find
it
difficult,
is
because
there
are
three
interrelated
things:
a)
to
what
extent
does
the
1983
apply
in
the
first
place
when
the
person
is
private,
b)
to
what
extent
is
there
ordinary
tort
law
immunity,
same
or
different
from
a
private
person,
and
3)
how
do
we
fit
into
those
answers
this
question
here
about
whether
there's
an
immunity?
if
that's
too
general
and
vague
for
you
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
private
schools
liable
under
1983?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that,
of
course,
is
why
i'm
interested
in
this
private
part,
because
pure
tort
law,
if
it
does
apply
to
this
private
person
like
any
other
private
person,
would
make
this
all
meaningless,
what
you're
saying,
because
the
person
would
have
a
cause
of
action,
the
injured
person,
under
state
tort
law,
and
it
really
wouldn't
matter,
and
unto
all
these
incentives,
and
which
way
the
contract
cuts
and
so
forth
would
all
be
totally
irrelevant,
really,
because
it
wouldn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
normally
sue...
you
normally
sue...
i
think
in
most
states
you
sue
a
tort
for
tort,
but
there
is
an
immunity
that
attaches
to
actions
of
a
government
official
under
ordinary
tort
law.
the
exact
scope
of
it
i
couldn't
tell
you,
but
that's
where
qualified
immunity
comes
from.
it's
a
transplant
from
that
basic
tort
law
principle.
at
least
that
was
my
understanding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
we
have
a
lay
magistrate
system
in
this
country
the
judges
will
lose
their
immunity,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
it...
i
don't
see
any
difference.
i
know
you've
made
a
big
point
of
this
in
your
brief,
but
i
don't
really
see
it.
why
doesn't
the...
a
corporation
wants
to
save
money.
so
the
government
doesn't
give
a
damn.
they
always
blame
somebody
else.
but
boy,
when
money's
at
stake,
they
get
busy--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
therefore
they
will
really
hew
the
line.
they
will...
they
don't
want
these
judgments,
and
therefore,
whatever
reason
we
have
for
giving
qualified
immunity
to
private...
to
public
officials,
we'll
just
apply
the
same
there.
i
mean,
why
does
the
fact
that
they
make
money
mean
they're
more
likely
to
violate
people's
rights?
you
could
as
easily
argue
it's
less
likely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
it
is
less
likely.
i
just
don't
see
that
it's
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
it...
look.
the...
suppose
i
were
inventing
the
system,
which
i
won't
do,
but
you
might
have
no
qualified
immunity
for
anybody,
and
just
have
an
insurance
policy,
which
would
put
terrifically
accurate
incentives
on
public
officials,
but
that
isn't
our
system.
we
have
qualified
immunity.
so
if
our
system
is
qualified
immunity,
it
must
be
because
we
want
the
people
performing
this
function
to
feel
not
totally
worried
that
they're
right
at
the
line.
if
that's
the
reason,
why
doesn't
that
reason
apply
here
with
equal
force?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
the
problem.
do
you
think
that
the
money
is
less
of
a
restraint,
or
more?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
that's
true,
then...
you're
not
going
to
know
the
answer
to
this
either,
i
bet,
because
i
bet
there
is
no
answer,
but
try
it,
but
my
impression,
the
qualified
immunity
thing,
it's
a
creation
by
this
court
interpreting
a
statute
that
rests
upon
common
law
tort
law,
and
the
kinds
of
immunity
that
under
common
law
tort
law
went
with
public
officials.
so
if
we're
going
back
to
history
i
would
be
quite
interested
as
to
how
the
states,
again,
have
applied
their
common
law
tort
law
to
people
who
suddenly
privatize,
take
over
state
functions.
if,
for
example,
they
were
to
say,
no,
there
is
no
immunity,
you're
treated
just
like
joe
blokes
out
in
the
street,
that
would
support
your
historical
argument
very
much,
because
then
they
would
have
evolved
tort
law
the
same
way,
and
the
opposite
would
be
the
opposite,
and
you're
going
to
tell
me
you
don't
know
because
it
probably
hasn't
come
up
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
now
what
happens
when...
exactly
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
ask
you
this.
it's
probably
not
a
very
great
point,
because
nobody's
made
it
on
the
other
side,
but
this
did
occur
to
me.
they
mostly
argued
this
incentive
thing,
which
we've
been
through,
but
if
you
go
back
into
the
history
of
these
cases,
i
once
thought
that
the
reason
this
qualified
immunity
developed
at
all
was
the
courts
are
focusing
on
a
particular
person
who
may
not
have
insurance.
he's
a
defendant,
and
they're
saying
this
poor
person,
you
know,
he's
trying
to
do
his
job,
here
his
life
is
ruined,
he's
stuck
with
$100,000
verdict...
we'll
hurt
the
plaintiffs
a
little
bit
in
order
to
help
him
out
a
little
bit.
now,
if
that
was
how
this
thing
developed...
and
certainly
learned
hand
probably
had
something
like
that
in
mind,
i
think,
in
gregoire
v.
biddle,
all
right...
then
it
is
a
different
world,
isn't
it,
where
people
have
insurance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
we're
going
into
this
different
world
when
people
have
insurance,
like
the
private
companies
all
must
under
contract,
then
that
defendant
is
somewhat
less
in
need
of
that
protection,
and
that...
though
no
one's
made
this,
so
maybe
there's
some
obvious
answer
to
this,
but
the...
if
they
don't
need
the
protection
because
we're
now
in
a
new
world,
does
that
sort
of
hurt
the
whole
idea
of
qualified
immunity,
at
least
as
applied
to
a
field
where
they
have
to
have
insurance?
