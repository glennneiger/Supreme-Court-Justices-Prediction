justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
take--
--well,
but
why
doesn't
the
impetus
for
what
you
call
public
accountability
work
exactly
the
same
way
in
this
case
with
the
accountability
of
a
contractor
to
the
person
who
may
or
may
not
renew
the
contract?
if
there's
a
lot
of
trouble
the
next
time
around
i
suppose
the
state
is
going
to
say,
gee,
we
ought
to
find
somebody
who
doesn't
seem
to
create
so
much
trouble
for
us.
why
isn't
that
just
as
much
and
perhaps
more
of
an
impetus
than
what
you
call
political
accountability?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we're
stuck
with
the
contract
for
the
contract
period,
but
all
contracts
are
going
to
be
renewed
at
some
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
your
argument,
then,
across
the
board
depend
on
the
proposition
that
making
money
for
shareholders
or
losing
money,
or
the
threat
of
losing
money,
is
a
less
powerful
motivating
factor
to
keep
people
behaving
properly
than
responsibility
to
voters,
or
general
considerations
of
patriotism?
i
sort
of
wish
you
were
right,
but
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
that
a
necessary
proposition?
that
is,
if
i
don't
think
that,
then
would
i
have
to
decide
the
other
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
you
could
be
declared
in
violation
of
your
contract
during
its
term.
it's
not
a
mere
problem
of
renewal.
