stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
can't
answer
this
case
by
thinking
of
anomalies,
because
i
can
think
of
anomalies
both
sides.
there's
the
blue
light
catering
service,
possibly
cured
by
saying
they're
not
employees
when
they're
not
there.
there
is
the
staggered
workweek,
possibly
cured
by
saying
sometimes
it
isn't
really
a
workday.
i
get
it
both
ways.
suppose
that
i
can't
answer
it
from
the
language.
suppose
the
legislative
history
seems
fairly
both
ways
or
not
clear.
why
wouldn't
i
just
go
with
the
eeoc
on
the
ground
that
they're
telling
me
this
is
administratively
easier?
it
tends
to
look
administratively
easier.
and
i'd
assume,
other
things
being
equal,
congress
would
want
to
have
the
court
look
at
what
the
agency
seems
reasonably
to
say
is
administratively
easier.
