under
your
proposed
rule
or
interpretation,
i
take
it
that
an
individual
could
be
employed
by
three
or
four
different
employers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
waxman--
--in
that
regard,
can
you
tell
me,
is
the
term
"payroll"
a
fixed,
stable,
knowable,
juridical
term
in
tax
law
or
in
some
other
area
of
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
refer
to
the
payroll
method
and
the
payroll.
is...
is
there
some
very
clear
definition
of
what
that
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
been...
it's
been
argued,
or
suggested,
that
the
payroll
method
is
much
easier
to
work
with.
i'm
going
to
ask
you
if
you
agree
with
that,
perhaps
with
an
example.
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
payroll
method,
and
an
employer
had
an
employee
who
worked
a
few
weeks
in
july,
and
might
or
might
not
come
back...
it
was
little
bit
un...
unclear...
does
the
employer
tell
the
payroll
department,
now
push
the
delete
button
on
the
computer,
and
take
this
person's
name
off?
is
it
subject
to
some
manipulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
some
clerical
reason
that
people
are
kept
on
the
payroll,
because
there's
a
certain
amount
of
information,
w-2
forms,
et
cetera,
that
it...
it's...
so
it's
just
much
easier
to
carry
them
forward
than
to
keep
putting
them
back
on
and
taking
them
off
every
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
while...
while
i
have
you,
in
connection
with
justice
stevens's
question...
because
i
was
thinking
of
the
same
thing
when
the
solicitor
general
was
arguing...
suppose
you
had
an
employer
that
worked
a
10-hour
day,
4
days
a
week.
those...
and
there
were
15
employees
on
each
of
those
days,
and
they
were
all
the
same
employees...
they...
they
would
be
covered
under
the
act,
would
they
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because,
4
working
days,
and
they're
there
all...
for
each
working
day?
