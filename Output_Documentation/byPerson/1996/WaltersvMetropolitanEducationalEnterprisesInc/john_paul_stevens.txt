justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
you
two
questions
that
i'd
just
like
to
get
your
views
on?
am
i
correct
in
understanding
your
position,
that
15
employees
don't
have
to
be
the
same
employees
on
each
of
the
15...
each
day
of
the
working
week,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
have
two
sets
of
work
force
that...
one
works
two
days
and
the
other
works
3
days,
but
on
each
of
the
days,
they'll
be
15,
but
they're
a
different
15
every--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no...
but
why
not?
why
not?
why
couldn't
you
have
two
work
forces,
one
of
them
work
monday
and
tuesday
and
the
other
one
works
wednesday,
thursday
and
friday,
and
each
of
them
has
more
than
15
people
that
work
full
time
for
the
days
they
work?
on
each
working
day,
the...
the
statutory
definition
would
be
satisfied,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
my
second
question
is,
is
it
not
possible
that
the
words,
"for
each
working
day",
simply
fulfill
the
function
of
deciding
how
long
the
workweek
is?
because
some
workweeks
are
5-day,
some
are
4,
some
are
6,
and
you
have
to
know,
for
each
working
day
in
the
week,
in
order
to
determine
how
long
the
week
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
without
that
phrase
in
it,
you
wouldn't
know
whether
the
whole
week
had
been
covered
or
not?
he
can't
say
every
day
of
the
week,
because
people...
nobody
works
7
days
a
week.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that...
that's
true
unless--
--i
think
you
answered
justice
ginsburg
differently
from
the
way
you
answered
me
on
whether
they
have
to
be
the
same
employees.
that's
right.
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me,
they
don't
have
to
be
the
same
15...
you
have
a
different
15
every
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
an
employee
on
each
day
that
he
or
she
reports.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
can
be...
you
can
have
15
on
monday
and
an
entirely
different
15
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
and
so
forth
and
still
come
within
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
justice
ginsburg
was--
--but
my
example
was...
was--
--assuming
the
contrary.
--if
on
one
day
there
are
only
14,
because
the
person
who
would
be
the
15th
man
works
overtime
during
the
week
in
order
to
get
the
fifth
day
off.
so
i
guess
it's
not
the
same
as
the...
the
question
that
justice
stevens
was
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i...
i
wonder
if
you...
if
you--
--may
i
just
add
one
question?
supposing
you
counted
the
days
for
purposes
of
counting
the...
calculating
a
christmas
bonus,
but
that's
the
only
thing
it
counts
for,
employee
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it's
compensation...
he
doesn't
show
up
at
work
on
any
fridays,
but
in
calculating
eligibility
for
the
christmas
bonus
at
the
end
of
the
year,
they
count
all
the
days
he
was
on
the
payroll.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
bonus
was
you...
you
get
a
dollar
a
day
for
every
day
you're
on
the
payroll,
even
though
you
didn't
work
certain
days.
under
your
compensation
test,
it'd
seem
to
me
he'd
be
an
employee.
that's
different
from
showing
up
at
work,
because
you...
i
think
you
agreed
with
justice
scalia,
your
test
is
not
presence,
because
you
take
people
on
sick
leave
and
so
forth.
but
if
your
test
is
compensation,
it
seems
to
me
that
any
element
of
compensation
that
would
accrue
to
a
person
on
the
payroll
at
the
end
of
the
year
or
for...
for
any...
any
benefit
whatsoever,
would
make
that
person
an
employee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no;
the
only
you
have
to
do
to
earn
it
is
be
on
the
payroll.
that's
the
point,
see.
and
there
are...
there
are
arrangements
like
that,
where
you
accrue
so
much
vacation
pay
because
of
days
on
the
payroll.
i
mean,
you've...
you've
agreed,
i
think,
if
you're
paid
for
vacation,
those
days
would
count?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
know
why,
then
days
on
which
you
accrue
additional
vacation
pay,
only
because
you're
on
the
payroll,
wouldn't
also
count.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
there's
a
good
reason,
but
i
don't
see
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
not
right.
no--
--because
you
agreed
it
at
least
serves
the
purpose
of
defining
the
workweek.
you
need
that
language
in
there
to
differentiate
between
4
and
5-day
workweeks,
and
6-day
workweeks.
