h.

mr.
waxman,
may
i
take
another
example,
which
i
take
it
might
be
a
more
common,
seasonal
practice?
and
that
would
be
of...
of
hiring,
say,
retired
individuals
to
work
for
a
month
or
two
during
agricultural...
picking
apples,
things
like
that.
if...
if...
if
an
individual...
let's
say
a
retired
individual...
is
hired
for
a
month
every
fall
by
his
neighbor
to
pick
apples
and
so
on,
and
at
the
end
of
the
month,
the...
the
two
people
say,
okay...
one
says,
i'll
be
back
in
11
month,
and
the
other
one
says,
i'll
expect
you
september
1st,
that's
a...
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
classic
example
of
the
seasonal
employee.
and
yet,
on...
on
your
theory,
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
continuing
employment
relationship.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
why
wouldn't
that
run
counter
to
what
the
dirksen
amendment
was
intended
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
it
does
come
up.
let's
assume
it
does
come
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
it's
another
marginal
case.
that's
a
classic
example
of
the
seasonal
employee,
but,
on
your
theory,
he
would
be
a...
a
continuing
employee.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then...
then
what
is
the
distinction
you're
drawing
between
justice
o'connor's
once
a
month...
one
day
a
month,
and...
and
the
one
month
a
year?
is
it...
is
it
a
concept
of...
of
seasonality
as
opposed
to
what,
periodicity
or
something
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr....
mr.
falahee,
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
we...
we've
got
this
problem,
because
of
an
amendment
offered
by
senator
dirksen.
do
you
think
it's
plausible
to
assume,
if
we're
going
to
look
to
legislative
history,
that
senator
dirksen
intended
employers...
and
the
government,
for
that
matter,
but
particularly
employers...
to
have
to
go
through
the
super-complicated
calculation
that
your
method
would
provide,
as
opposed
to
the
much
simpler
method
that
the
eeoc
and
your
opposing
counsel
propose?
does...
is
senator
dirksen
the
kind
of
person
who
wanted...
was
he
the
kind
of
person
who
wanted
to
thrust
that
heavy
obligation
on
employers?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
we've
got
an
example
of
what
happens
to
them
in
this
case,
don't
we?
i
mean,
the
discovery
was
gargantuan.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
isn't
that
going
to
be
true
in...
in
any
case
that's
close
to
the
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
any
case
that's
close
to
the
line
is,
by
definition,
going
to
be
the
case
of
the
comparatively
small
employer.
