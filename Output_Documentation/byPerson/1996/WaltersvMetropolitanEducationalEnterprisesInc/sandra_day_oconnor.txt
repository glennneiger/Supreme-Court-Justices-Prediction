well,
what
if
the
employee
is...
shows
up
for
work
one
day
a
month
to
do
some
accounting
work
and,
therefore,
is
kept
on
the
employer's
so-called
overall
list
of
employees
to
do
this
stuff
one
day
a
month...
that's
enough--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
count
for
the
whole
month?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
person
is
listed,
hasn't
been
taken
off
the
computer
base,
but
in
fact
hasn't
done
any
work
for,
let's
say,
4
months;
do
we
count
that
person
for
the
4
months?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
are
some
questions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
completely
endorse
the
department
of
labor's
regulations,
adopting
the
payroll
method
for
the
family
leave
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
could
be
a
bright-line
test
to
say
that
the
term,
"for
each
working
day
in
each
of
20
or
more
weeks.
"
means
just
people
who
were
there
each
working
day.
that's
a
bright-line
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
may
have
been
difficult
to
calculate,
but
the
rule
was
clear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
could
determine
each
person
for
each
working
day,
could
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
different
rationale,
ease
of
administration.
and
there,
you
could
be
right...
payroll
plan
is...
is
easier.
but
i
think
that's
a
different
rationale
than
a
bright-line
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
am
troubled,
though,
by
what
we
do
with
this
language,
"for
each
working
day".
i...
just
reading
it,
without
all
of
these
other
arguments,
one
would
tend,
i
think,
rather
naturally,
to
think
it
means
what
it
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
your
test,
a
person
who
is
hired
to
come
in
one
day
a
month
and
do
some
special
accounting
work
is
an
employee
for
every
day
of
the
month,
i
gather?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
rest
of
the
month.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
my
concern
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
how
you
read
into
it
an
employment
relationship
for
each
such
day,
and
you
find
an
employment
relationship
even
in
situations
where
somebody
isn't
there
for
months,
but
stays
on
some
convenient,
little
payroll,
in
case,
sometime
in
the
future,
hauled
in
to
be
a
substitute
for
something
or
other.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
applying
your
standard,
it's
an
employee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he's
on
that
employer's
list--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
might
come
back
some
day.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
expects
to
come
back
the
first
tuesday
of
every
summer,
or
at
least
occasionally
during
the
year.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
large
numbers.
we're
talking
about
an
employer
where
the
margin
is
14
or
15,
and
when
do
we
count.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
application
of...
of
when
there's
an
employment
relationship
is
a
very
loose
one,
indeed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
there
is
identical
language
now
in
the
family
leave
act,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
the
result
there?
are
there
specific
regulations
and
so
forth
that
make
that
clear?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the...
the
payroll
method
is
used,
as
it's
called?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
same
construction,
apparently,
is
going
to
apply
in
ada
and
adea
cases,
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is
strange,
is
it
not,
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
you
might
end
up
with
the
payroll
method
used
under
the
family
leave
act,
ada,
adaea,
and
a
different
one
under
title
vii.
i...
i
find
that
a
little
troublesome.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
the
family
medical
leave
act
regulations
give
a
clear
definition
of
what
an
employment
relationship
consists
of?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess--
--of
course,
the--
--the
main
difference
between
you
and
the
other
side
is
what
counts
as
an
employment
relationship
on
each
day.
and
you
say
what
counts
is
only
presence
that
day.
and
they
say
no,
if
you
have
someone
who
is
regularly
here
2
hours
a
day
for
4
days,
that
continues
an
employment
relationship
for
counting
purposes
on
the
days
they
don't
appear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that
seems
to
be
the
main
difference,
is
what
counts
as
an
employment
relationship.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
agree
that's
the
main
point
of
difference
between
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would.
i
mean,
they
say
they
give
full
effect
for
each
working
day.
where
the
difference
comes...
in
defining
who's
employed
each
day.
they
say,
we
give
full
effect
for
each
day.
but
someone
who
works
part-time
is
going
to
be
considered
working
each
day.
that's
where
the
difference
is.
