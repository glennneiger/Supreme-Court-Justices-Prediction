mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
government's
position
that
an
employer
is
covered
by
title
vii
when
it
has
an
ongoing
employment
relationship
with
15
or
more
employees
for
each
working
day
in
each
of
20
or
more
calendar
weeks.
we
think
that
interpretation
is
correct
for
several
reasons.
first,
this
interpretation,
unlike
the
seventh
circuit
test,
fully
comports
with
the
text,
which
states
that
an
employer
is
a
person,
quote,
who
has
15
or
more
employees
for
each
working
day.
it
does
not
say,
has
15
or
more
employees
present
for
each
working
day,
but
if
they're
not
present,
count
them
if
they
are
on
paid
leave,
but
not
if
they're
on
unpaid
leave,
unless
they're
salaried
rather
than
hourly,
in
which
case
count
them
anyway.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
would...
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
tautology.
it's
not
defined
in
the
statute,
but
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
to...
to
the
contrary,
justice
scalia.
i
would
give
you
the
example
of...
for
example,
a...
a
factory
that
employs
20
employees
to
work
2
hours
a
day,
6
days
a
week,
that
company
is...
and
sunday
is
not
a
working
day...
that
company
is
covered
by
title
vii.
but
if
you
take
the
same
company,
making
the
same
product,
and
say,
we're
going
to
have
the
same
20
workers,
but
we,
in
order
to
meet
increased
production
demand,
we
want
them
to
work
four
10-hour
days,
under
the
seventh
circuit
reading,
that
company
would
no
longer
be
covered,
because
there
would
not
be
15
or
more
employees
on--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
will--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
will
concede,
because
even
the
devil
can
quote
scripture.
you
can
produce
absurd
results
under
either
theory.
but
my
point...
and
i
hope
i
can
make
it
here...
is
that
one
of
the
central
problems
with
the
seventh
circuit
test
is
that
it
produces
bizarre
results
even
when
applied
to
common
employment
situations,
not
just
the
absurd
situations.
let
me
give
you
another
example.
a
business
employs
20...
retail
business...
it
employs
25
people.
it's
open
5
days
a
week,
downtown
washington,
d.c.
business
is
good.
the
owner
decides
he
wants
to
open
on
saturdays.
but
because
it's
downtown,
what
he
does
is
he
asks
half
the
employees
to
come
in
on
saturday
one
week,
and
the
other
half
to
come
in
on
the
other
saturday.
under
the
seventh
circuit
test,
that
business,
thereby,
ipso
facto,
removes
itself
from
the
coverage
after
title
vii.
because
on
the
sixth
working
day,
there
are
not
15
hourly
employees
present.
or
consider
the
example
that
this
very
court
considered
in
the
skidmore
case,
which
was
previously
mentioned.
in
skidmore,
there
was
a
factory
worker
who
was
required,
on
some
of
his
days
off,
to
remain
on
or
near
the
factory,
on
call,
unpaid,
in
order
to
be
available
in
the
event
of
a
fire
emergency.
he
was
not
paid
unless
there
was
an
emergency,
but
he
was
required
to
stay
in
the
factory
or
within
a
few
minutes
of
it.
does
this
man
somehow
cease
to
be
an
employee
when
he
is
on
call?
plainly,
his
employment
relationship
continues
for
that
day.
but
under
the
respondent's
test,
he
would,
ipso
facto,
not
be
counted
because
he
was
not
at
work
and
he
was
not
paid.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i'm...
i'm
with
you
part
of
the
way,
justice
o'connor.
under
our...
let
me
respond.
under
our
test,
you
have
to
look
at
every
working
day
for
each
calendar
week,
in
20
weeks,
and
look
at
the
number
of
employees
that
that
employer
has.
now,
assuming
the
person
comes
in
on
a
monday
and
is
working,
if
that
person
is
not
an
independent
contractor,
that
person
counts
as
one.
if
the
person
doesn't
come
in
for
the
rest
of
the
week,
but
has
an
employment--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--or
the
rest
of
the
month...
but
has
a
employment
relationship
such
that
his
job
responsibilities,
as
an
employee...
he's
not
an
independent
contractor,
he's
an
employee
who
works
1
day
a
month...
the
answer
is
yes,
he
is
an
employee
for
the
rest
of
those
periods
of
time
if,
applying
the
traditional
standards
that
this
court
applied
in
nlrb
v.
town
&
country,
and
nationwide
insurance
v.
darden,
an
employment
relationship
exists.
and
i
think,
actually,
your
example
points
out
not
an
anomaly
in
our
reading,
but
a
reason
why
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
really
quite
compelled.
if
i
can
just
pick
up
on
your
example
and
expand
it,
that
type
of
a
situation
would
probably
relate
most
often,
for
example,
in
a...
a
catering
business,
where
the
caterer
caters
small
jobs
and
large
banquets.
some
days
the
caterer
needs
only
three
people
to
help.
some
days
the
caterer
needs
a
hundred
people
to
help.
and
the
caterer
has
a
group
of
80
people
who
ordinary...
who
understand
that
when
there's
work,
they
will
work
for
the
caterer.
there
may
not
be
work
every
day.
and,
even
when
there's
work,
the
caterer
can
decide
who
gets
called.
if
it
turns
out
that
there
is
a
20-year
black
employee
of
that
company
who
comes
in
and
makes
a
complaint,
saying,
look,
i
have
worked
at
this
company
longer
than
anybody
else.
i
have
more
seniority
and
experience
than
anybody
else.
but
on
all
the...
the
only
times
i
ever
get
called
is
when
there
is
nobody
else
available.
shouldn't
that
person,
under...
could
title
vii
possibly
mean
that
that
person
would
not
have
a
bona
fide
employment
discrimination
claim?
what
congress
was
intent--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--of
the
counting.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
hope
i
can
answer
all
these
questions.
first,
let
me
say
it
is
not--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is
not
our
position
that
if
a
person
quits
on
friday,
that
person
isn't
counted
for
the
week.
that
person
is
counted
for
each
working
day
in
which
he
or
she
is
employed.
so,
in
calculating
the
number
of
people
who
are
employees
for
each
day,
that
person
would
be
counted
monday
through
thursday,
but
not
friday.
but
the
purpose...
if
i
understood
your
question,
justice
ginsburg...
the
purpose
is
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
ascribe
that
kind
of
a
meaning
to
the
words
"for
each
working
day"?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we,
like
the
respondents,
give
the
same
meaning
to
that
word,
which
means
that,
in
determining
whether
there
are
15...
the
issue
is
15
what
+/?
in
determining
whether
there
are
15,
you
need
to
look
on
a
day-by-day
basis.
if
the
business
has
6
working
days
a
week,
you
need
to
look,
under
our
test,
at
whether
for
each
of
those
days,
the
business
had
an
employment
relationship
with
15
or
more
people.
and
the
reason
that
congress
put
that
language
into
the
statute,
in
the
dirksen-mansfield
amendment
in
the
senate,
was
stated
by
senator
dirksen
during
the
course
of
the
legislative
debates.
and
what
he
said
is
the
purpose
of
adding
the
words,
"for
each
working
day
on
20
or
more
calendar
weeks
in
the
present
year
or
the
preceding
year.
"
was
to
remove
from
coverage
of
title
vii
seasonal
workers.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
no.
but
if
you
go...
if
you
go
on
and
look
at
what
senator
dirksen
said...
and
it's
cited
at
page
28
of
our
brief...
senator
dirksen
explained,
quote,
the
definition
of
employer
was
amended
to
provide
a
specific
test
of
computing
the
number
of
employees
of
an
employer.
in
other
words,
if
you
just
said
you
have
to
have
15
or
more
employees
in
20
weeks,
there
are
a
number
of
different
counting
methods
one
might
use
in
order
to
determine
it.
for
example,
you
could
say
just
add
up
the
total
number
of
people
who
did
any
work
that
week,
however
little,
and
use
that.
or
add
up
the
total
number
of
people
that
were
employees
on
the
beginning
of
the
week.
what
congress
said
specifically
was,
we
want
to
tell
you
how
to
count.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
i...
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i
have
to...
i
have
to
respectfully
disrespect...
disagree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
respect
you,
and
i
disagree
with
you.
[laughter]
the
question
is,
when
congress
was
dealing
with
the
problem
of
seasonal
workers,
which
the
legislative
history
shows
it
was
extremely
concerned
with,
it
was
going
to
deal
with
it
with...
with
general
language
or
with
precise
language.
if
it
had
just
said
if
you
have
15
or
more
work...
workers
in
20
or
more
weeks,
you're
covered.
but
it
went
beyond
that.
it
gave
specific
meaning
to
the
way
in
which
employers
must
count
during
those
weeks.
it
is
not
one
of
the
20
weeks,
unless
for
each
working
day
of
that
week
you
have
15
or
more
employees.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
just
applies
an
accounting
method.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
in
that
instance,
your
honor,
the
court
would
have
to
address
the
question
of
whether,
in
fact,
that
was
an
employee,
applying
whatever
standard
that
this
court
will
announce
in
this
case--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
may--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
may
very
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
may
very
well
not
be
an
employee.
if
it's
somebody
who
works
for
me
the
first
tuesday
of
the
summer,
has
no
expectation
of
coming
back
on
a
particular
day--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
my...
my
response
to
you
is
that
if
an
employer
chooses
to
operate
his
business
that
way,
that
is,
by
using
large
numbers
of
intermittent
employees
who
come
regularly
but
intermittently,
that
employer
should--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
do
think...
with
respect
to
the
14
and
15,
there
has
to
be
a
line
anywhere.
but...
but
my
point
is
that
the
purpose
of
setting
the
number
at
25
and
then
15...
and
congress
also
considered
8...
had
to
do
with
preserving
the
intimate
mom-and-pop
business,
and
those
intimate
work
environments
in
which
everybody
knows
each
other,
and
it's...
it
would
be
wrong
to
impose
upon
them
the
scrutiny
of
title
vii.
if
an
employer
chooses
to
conduct
his
business
by
using
lots
and
lots
of
different
people,
thereby
employing
lots
and
lots
of
different
relationships,
congress
has
decided
that
yes,
that
employer
may
not
discriminate.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
this...
this
employer...
there
are
a
lot
of
plausible
explanations.
this
employer,
himself,
during
the
other
11
months,
may
be
employing
15
or
more
people
working
on
his
farm
or
doing
any
other
thing.
so
the
issue
may
not
come
up.
but
if
the
issue
does
come
up--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i
were...
if...
i...
i
think
a
very
creditable
argument
could
be
made
in
that
instance,
if
i
were
litigating
a
case,
that
because
congress
meant
to
exclude
seasonal
businesses,
there
was
not
an
employment
relationship
during
the
intervening
11
months.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
i
think...
i
think
applying
federal
law,
construing
the
definition
of
employer
as
this
court
will
interpret
it,
this...
a...
a
court...
or
the
eeoc
would
have
to
determine
whether
there
was
in
fact
a
real,
ongoing
employment
relationship.
and
many
courts
would
say
no
in
that
instance.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is
no...
to
my
knowledge,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
no
fixed
method.
and
the
word...
the
use
of
the
word
"payroll"
to
describe
our
test
is
in
fact
really
not
very
accurate.
our...
we
look
at
the
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--thank
you.
