mr.
constantine
john
gekas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
construction
of
section
701(b)
of
title
vii,
which
defines
the
term
15
or
more
employees
for
each
working
day
in
each
of
20
or
more
calendar
weeks
in
the
current
or
preceding
calendar
year,
and
any...
any
agent
of
such
person.
we
seek
review
of
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case,
which
was
that
the
words,
"for
each
working
day",
can
only
be
construed
to
have
meaning
under
a
test
that
counts
employees
only
on
the
days
that
they
are
present
at
work
or
on
the
days
that
they
are
on
paid
leave,
except
for
salaried
employees.
and
for
salaried
employees,
the
seventh
circuit
said
it
makes
no
difference
where
they
are,
what
they're
doing
or
how
they're
paid.
we
believe
that
this
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
because
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
focuses
on
the
orgoing
employment
relationship.
second
of
all,
because
the
suggestion
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
all
the
other
courts
which
have
considered
the...
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
"for
each
working
day",
they
are
wrong
when
they
say
that
only
this
day-by-day
method
gives
that
phrase
meaning.
and,
thirdly,
because
if
the
text
is
ambiguous...
and
there
is
some
suggestion,
just
because
of
the
stark
split
in
the
courts
on
this,
that
perhaps
the
statute
is
ambiguous...
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
intent
of
congress,
the
policy
underlying
title
vii,
and
the
eeoc's
own
administrative
interpretation
of
the...
of
the
statute
and
those
words
favor
the
payroll
method--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
under
our
view,
all
employees
who
have
an
ongoing
employment
relationship
would
be
counted.
under
the
seventh
circuit's
test,
a
part-time
employee,
for
example,
who
works
4
days
out
of
the
week,
but
not
the
fifth
day...
assuming
a
monday
to
friday
workweek...
would
not
be
counted
on
a
friday.
with
this
case,
we
have
assumed
ourselves
past
the
problem
of
defining
the
term
"workday"
or
"workweek",
and
we've
basically
focused
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
necessity
to
focus
on
whether
or
not
someone's
at
work
or
not.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes,
it
is,
because
the--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--that's
right.
because
there's
an
ongoing
employment
relationship.
we
submit
that
it's--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
focuses
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
during
the
time
that
the
person
is
not
there,
that
person
is
an
employee.
there
is
a
body
of
law,
both
from
this
court...
darden
and
reid
and
the
recent
decision
last
year,
nlrb
against
town
&
country,
that
sets
forth
a
set
of
criteria
having
to
do
with
control.
and
i
would
submit
that,
in
that
circumstance,
where
there's
ambiguity
because
of
some
long
period
of
time
for
which
the
employee
is
not
present,
that
the
courts
would
look
really
at
the...
at
the
circumstance
of
the
employee
under
those
tests
of
employment
control...
presence
at
work
is
one
of
them...
and
it
doesn't
really
present,
in
our
view...
that
hypothetical
doesn't
really
present,
in
our
view,
the
issue
that's
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes,
it's
questions,
but
question--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--yes,
we
have,
generally.
do
we
completely
endorse...
endorse
it?
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes,
we
do.
we
think
that
that's
a
very
sensible
application
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
has
to
do,
in
part,
to
the
deference
issue
that's
presented
by
the
court...
by
this
case,
rather...
and
it...
it...
one
thing
that
the
department
of
labor
regulations
do
suggest
and
do
show
is
that
this
is
a
reasonable
interpretation.
it's
just
not
an
interpretation
that
the
e...
eeoc
has
come
up
with.
it
is
one
that
the
department
of
labor,
on
an
independent
statute,
has
come
up
with.
it's
one,
indeed,
that
congress,
in
subsequent
legislation,
has
come
up
with.
it
is,
indeed,
one
that
half
of
the
courts
considering
this
issue
have
come
up
with.
and
so--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
clearly,
under
the
case
law,
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
a
distinction
about
the
degree
of
deference
that
is
given.
it
seems
to
me,
in
looking
at
this...
and
mr.
waxman,
of
course,
can
speak
more
authoritatively...
but
looking
at
the
question
of
the
court's
last
two
or
three
decisions
in
the
eeoc
area
about
deference,
commercial
office
products...
and
i
think
it's
gilbert...
general
electric
against
gilbert
in
the
aramco
case...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
deference
issue
for
the
eeoc
is
treated
somewhat
differently
between
commercial
office
products
on
the
one
hand
and
aramco
and
gilbert
on
the
other.
and
as
your
honor--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--yes,
you
did,
indeed.
[laughter]
i
was...
i
was
about
to
say--
i
was
about
to...
not
claim
authoriship
for
that,
but
to
attribute
it
to
your
honor's
con...
concurrence
in...
which
case
was
it?
and
the
point
is
i
think
that,
whatever
the
test...
whatever
the
test
is,
whether
it's
the
commercial
office
products
test
or
the
strickland
test
from
the...
the
1940's,
that
the...
the
issue...
the
decision
of
the
eeoc
fares
fairly
well
here,
because...
and
it
doesn't...
the
decision
about
deference
doesn't
have
to
turn
on
the
question
of
the
formality
of
rulemaking
authority.
because
if
you
go
back
to
the
more
stringent
test
that
the
court
applies,
the
stringent...
the
strickland
test--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--skidmore,
that's
right.
thank
you,
your
honors.
skidmore,
from
the
forties.
in
that...
that
case,
the
standard
about
reasonableness
and
the
validity
of
the
reasoning,
the
power
of
the
persuasive
force,
it
seems
to
me,
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
the
department
of
labor
has
reached
the
same
conclusion;
congress,
in
adopting
a
different
statute,
has
reached
the
same
conclusion--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
that's--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
that
kind
of
detailed
criteria
is
not
contained
in
the
more
recent
decisions
on
that.
i
would
say
that
there
is...
there...
there
is
some
force,
some
rational
force,
to
the
eeoc's
interpretation,
whether
or
not--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--whether
or
not--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
i'm
saying...
i'm
saying
that
if
the...
if
the
test
is
the
skidmore
test,
then
it's...
this
regulation
satisfies
it,
because
it
has
rational
force,
internally
coherent,
sensibly
based
on
the
statutory
language.
and
there
is
also
some
unanimity
of
opinion...
perhaps
not
entirely
unanimous,
because
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
other
cases
that
go
against
it,
but
there
is...
two-thirds
of
the
people
looking
at
this...
the
congress--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--yes.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes.
well,
the
question
of
a
former
employee
in
the...
in
the
retaliation
section
is
presented
by
the
next
case--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--yes.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
yes.
well,
that's
what
we
call
the
midweek
employment
change--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--if
i
understand
the
focus
of
your
question.
and
the
midweek
employment
change
is
the
one
that
we
say
gives
meaning
to
the
term,
"for
each
working
day",
under
the
test
that
we
advocate.
the
shorthand
of
it...
our
test
is
called
the
payroll
test.
really,
what
it
focuses
on
is
the
existence
of
the
employment
relationship.
and
the
words,
"for
each
working
day",
have
meaning
if
you
do
not
count
a
person
who,
in
the
midweek,
leaves
the
employment
relationship.
so,
therefore,
if
an
employee
is
on
the
payroll
from...
and
working
in
an
employment
relationship...
from
monday
to
wednesday,
and
leaves--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
with
any
reasonable
test,
there
are
going
to
be
hypotheticals,
i
think,
perhaps
more
infrequent
in
practice
than
not,
that
suggest
that,
at
the
fringes,
maybe
the
rule
doesn't
have
intuitive
sense.
but
there's
a
whole
range
of
federal
statutes...
there's
the
tax
statutes,
the
labor
statute,
osha
statutes...
there's
a
whole
range
of...
of
statutes
that
are
designed
to
protect
and
include
just
such
a
person.
a
person
who
comes
in
once
a
month
for
2
hours
is...
is
included
under
those
statutes.
and
so,
as
a
matter
of
federal
scheme,
there's
nothing
untoward
in
this
scheme,
which
is
one
designed
to
protect
employees
from
discrimination.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
sure.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
well,
the
reason
for
it
is
because
congress
had
to
draw
a
line
somewhere.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
legislative
history
shows
very
clearly...
senator
dirksen's
colloquy
with
his
colleagues
shows
very
clearly
what
they
wanted
was
a
bright-line
test,
not
just
to
avoid
complications
in
handling
these
cases
in
the
eeoc
and
in
the
judiciary--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--if
there's
any
experience
from
this
case
that
we
can
gain,
it
is
that
that
test,
the
working
day
test,
is
not
a
bright-line
test.
it
was
an
agonizing
experience
for
us
to
go
through
the
process
of
trying
to
figure
out
who
was
present
at
work--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
when
i
say
statement
of...
of
bright-line
rule,
i
don't
mean
just
one
that
can
be
easily
stated
and
capsulized
in
a
phrase.
i
mean
one
that
can
be
easily
stated,
but
also
easily
applied.
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
well,
i
suggest...
well,
i
suggest
that,
to
the
extent
that
the
senate
debates
focussed
on
ease
of
administration...
and
they
did
to
a
great
extent...
that's
what
i
mean
when
i
say
"a
bright-line
test".
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
absolutely
correct.
and
the...
the
case
law
under
the
various
labor
statutes
says
that
someone
can
be
an
agent
of
different
masters...
can
be
a
servant
of
different
masters.
so
there's
nothing
untoward
about
that.
to
amplify
a
little
bit
on
my
answer
to
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
important
to
realize
that
these
two
tests
are
not
exclusive.
the
test
that
mr.
falahee
is
going
to
advocate
for
the
respondents
includes
the
test
that
we
say,
because
you
have
to
be
an
employee,
you
have
to
be
in
an
employment
relationship
to
be
counted
for
the
purposes
of...
for
the
purpose
of
his
test.
you
go
on
to
determine
whether
or
not
someone
is
at
work
or
on
leave.
then
you
go
on,
again,
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
on
paid
leave.
but
it's
an
important
analytical
point
to
make
here...
that
our
test
is
included
in
their
test.
we
say
essentially
that
you
should
stop
for
a
variety
of
policy
reasons
and
ease
of
administration,
not
just
in
the
question
of
applying...
saving
lawyers
and
magistrate
judges
and
judges...
district
court
judges...
work--
mr.
constantine
john
gekas
--well,
the...
i
guess
our
point
is
that
you
can't
read,
"for
each
working
day",
just
in
isolation
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
this
statute
says
an
employer
who
has
15
or
more
employees.
and
i
think
that
the
government's
brief,
by
the
solicitor
general,
in
this
case,
for
the
eeoc,
very
clearly
points
out,
with
citations
to
appropriate
references,
that
the
word
"has",
in
the
context
of
the
other
words
that
are
put
together,
necessarily
implies
the
existence
of
an
employment
relationship.
