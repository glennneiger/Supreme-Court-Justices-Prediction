mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
congress,
back
in
1964,
intended
to
subject
certain
small
businesses
to
federal
regulation
under
title
vii.
congress
had
the
authority
to
subject
virtually
all
employers
to
that
regulation,
but
congress
specifically
chose
not
to
do
so.
congress
chose
to
exclude
small
businesses
by
looking
to
the
size
of
the
business's
work
force.
in
other
words,
a
small
business
was
defined
with
respect
to
the
number
of
employees
it
has
working
for
each
day.
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
no
canons
of
construction,
nor
principles
of
deference
to
administrative
rulings
or
agency
rulings,
supports
the
government's...
the
eeoc's
position.
your
honors,
i
believe
the
accurate
test
to
focus
on
here,
once
again,
is
the
size
of
an
employee's
business.
congress
chose
to
measure...
or
the
yardstick
that
congress
chose
was
the
number
of
employees
who
were
working
for
an
employee,
not
the
number--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such...
of
any
such
prior
statute
that
congress
would
have
looked
to.
however,
the
phrase
that's
before
this
court,
eeoc's
argument.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
i'm
aware
of
no...
no
exemption
that's
similar
to...
to
this,
your
honor,
no.
no.
while
it
is
clear
that...
that
congress
borrowed
the
20-week...
it
is
clear
that
congress
borrowed
the
20-week
concept
from
the
unemployment
compensation
act,
but
the
language
in
the
unemployment
compensation
act
is
markedly
different
from
the
language
that
ultimately
found
its
way
into
title
vii.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
congress
has--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--congress
has
authorized
the
eeoc
to
promulgate
regulations
for
purposes
of
the
family
and
medical
leave
act.
and
pursuant
to
those
regulations,
your
honor,
the
payroll
method,
as
it's
been
described,
is
the
method
that
the
eeoc
had
advocated.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
arguably
it
could.
i
believe
the...
the
distinction,
however,
between
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
and
between...
between
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
and
between
title
vii,
the
case
before
this
court,
is
that,
in
title
vii,
congress
specifically
declined
to
authorize
the
eeoc
to
promulgate
any
regulations
other
than
procedural
regulations.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
the
possibility
of
arriving
at
inconsistent
results
does
indeed
exist.
however,
i
believe
that
the
focus
in
this
case
needs
to
be
on
the
definition
of
1964,
not
what
congress
might
have
intended
decades
later,
when
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
was...
was
adopted.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
i
don't
believe
they
do,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
they
do.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
i
would...
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--yes.
the
legislative
history
of...
of
title
vii
is...
and
in
particular,
the
legislative
history
that
relates
to
the
phrase
before
this
court,
"for
each
working
day",
is
unusually
sparse.
the
phrase,
vii.
however,
the
later
congress...
30
years
later...
in
enacting...
in
enacting
the
family
and
medical
leave
act,
did
conduct
what
i...
i
suspect
would
be
a
more...
could
be
described
as
a
more
comprehensive
debate,
or
a
more
detailed
discussion
of
what
this
terminology
meant.
unlike
the
family...
unlike
the
family
and
medical
leave
act,
there
are
no
committee
reports
for
title
vii.
and
those
are
the
types
of...
those
are
the
types
of
sources
that
this
court
has
historically
looked
upon
as
the
most
compelling
or
the
most
persuasive
legislative
history.
and
the
guides...
those
guides,
those
precise
guides
that
this
court
has
relied
upon
heavily
in
prior
cases
are
absent
in
this
case.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
except...
except
for...
where
i
would
differ
with...
with
your
honor
on
that
is
i
think
there
can
only
be
a
single
work
force,
not
multiple
work
forces.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes,
it
would.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes,
it
would.
it--
--it--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--that
would
be
a...
a
permissible
interpretation
of
the
phrase,
"for
each
working
day".
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
i...
i...
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
a
way
to
determine
that,
your
honor,
no.
to--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--well,
i...
i
believe
your...
your
honor's
question
presents
a
hypothetical
similar
to
the
one
suggested
by...
by
justice
o'connor.
i
suppose,
under
that
hypothetical
set
of
facts,
it
would
really
determine...
or
what
would...
what
would
determine
the
outcome
is
whether
the
employer
did
call
up
his...
his
payroll
department
or
his
automated
payroll
service
and
instruct
the
powers
that
be
to
remove
john
smith
or
jane
doe
because
they're
no
longer
here.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
well,
while...
while
an...
an
employer
is
required
to
maintain
certain
information
for
tax
purposes,
particularly
to
generate
w-2
forms
at
the
end
of
the
year,
i
think
the...
the
answer
to...
to
your
honor's
question
would
really
depend
on
what
type
of
a
payroll
service
was...
was
being
utilized.
i
think
that
could
probably
differ
from
case
to
case,
depending
upon...
upon
the
method
of
maintaining
the
payroll.
and
even
with
respect
to
an
automated
payroll
system,
i
suggest
that,
depending
on
the
way
that
system
works,
there
could
be
different
outcomes.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
under...
under
our
approach,
yes.
yes.
those
employees--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
while
the...
while
the
result
is
theoretically
possible,
i
think
the
issue
that--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--i...
i...
i
believe
that
the...
that
the
hypothetical
your
honor
posits
raises
a
somewhat
different
question.
and
that
is,
what
is...
what
is
a
working
day?
is...
is
it
a
working
day?
in
other
words,
is...
does
a
working
day
happen?
is
there
a
working
day
when
an
employer
does
not
conduct
its
full
operations?
and
i
believe
there...
there
have
been
some
lower
court
cases
recognizing
that,
in...
in...
in
hypotheticals
similar
to
your
honor's,
that
fifth
day
would
not
be
counted
as
a
working
day,
to
avoid
precisely
that
result.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
under...
under
the...
under
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
the
count
would
be
15
on
monday,
tuesday,
wednesday,
and
thursday.
and,
apart
from
the...
the
four...
from
the
working
day
issue,
the
issue
of
whether
that
fifth
day
is
a
working
day,
as
justice
scalia
had...
has
asked,
that
one
individual
who
comes
in
on
friday
would
be...
would
be
counted.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
no.
in...
in
that
particular
week,
in
a
case
in
which
the
15th
individual
does
not
report
for
work
on
friday,
that
individual--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--that...
that
individual
would
be
counted
for
the
days
he
or
she
worked.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
that...
under
that...
under
that
set
of
facts,
carried
forward
for
52
weeks,
that...
that
person
would
not
be
considered
an...
an
employer
for--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--that
is...
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
the
same...
the
same
individual
need
not
report
each
day
to
be
considered
an
employee.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
i--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--the
focus
is
on
counting
the
number
of
individuals,
not
the
particular
individuals.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
that...
that...
under
that
scenario,
the
employer
would
be
subject
to
title
vii,
yes,
your
honor.
again,
because
the...
the
focus...
the...
the...
the
focus
that...
that
congress
had,
in
terms
of
measuring
what
is
a
small
business,
looked
to
the
size
of
the
employer's
work
force
for
each
working
day.
and
that
work
force
could
vary
during...
during
the
course
of
the
week.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
your--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--your
honor,
our
test
does
not
focus
upon
the
existence
of
an
employment
relationship
whatsoever.
the
eeoc's
test--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--as...
as
to
the
focus,
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
well,
if
the...
if
the
christmas
bonus
test
used
the
same
language
as
title
vii,
i
believe
we
would
have
to
apply
the
same
test.
i
think...
i
think
it
would
really
depend
on
what
the...
what
the
language
of
the
christmas
bonus
policy
was,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
no.
the...
the...
the...
the
concept
of
a...
of
a
christmas
bonus,
as...
as
i
understand
it,
is...
is
typically
an
extra
check
at
the
end
of
the
year.
that
if...
if...
if
that
check
is
earned,
if
you
will,
i
suspect,
in
one
broader
sense,
it's
earned
pro
rata
for...
for
a
period
of
employment.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
because--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--because
compensation,
i
believe,
is
a...
is
a
better
measure
of
the
employer's
work
force
for
each
working
day.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
for
purposes
of
a
christmas
bonus,
yes.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
under...
under
our
method,
such
an
individual
would
be
counted
for
that--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
there...
there
are
several
answers
to
that
question,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
indication
from
either
the
statutory
language
or
from
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii
that
congress
was
concerned
about
writing
a
test
that
would
necessarily
be
easy
to
implement.
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume,
however,
that
congress
was
concerned
about
writing
a
test
that
would
be
accurate,
in
terms
of
measuring
the
size
of
a
small
business.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
consumer
product
safety
commission
against
gte,
the
fact
that
a
particular
interpretation
might
produce
a
result,
or
might...
might...
might
produce
a
burdensome
result
is
not
sufficient
to
overcome
an
otherwise
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
central
difficulty
with
the
eeoc's
interpretation
of...
of
the
definition
in
section
701(b)
is
that
it
reads
the
phrase,
"for
each
working
day",
completely
out
of
the
statute.
under
the--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--as...
as
to
that
purpose,
that
would
be
a
permissible
purpose,
your
honor.
but
it
would
not
have
any
bearing...
that
phrase
would
have
no
bearing
upon
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
distinction
really
comes
down
to
how
we...
in...
in
your
honor's
hypothetical...
comes
down
to
how
we
define
part-time.
the
phrase,
"part-time",
isn't
used
anywhere
in
the
definition
of
employer.
the
language
did
come
up.
it
was...
it
was
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
but
there's
no
specific
definition
of
the
phrase...
of...
of
the...
the
language,
"part-time".
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
and
that
individual,
your
honor,
would
be
counted
for
each
of
those
5
days.
the
question
is
not
whether
the
individual
is
a
quote,
unquote,
employee
for--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--one
of
the
other
difficulties,
your
honor,
with...
with
the
principle
of
deference...
there...
there
are
several
other
problems--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--i--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--well--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--under...
well,
possibly,
your
honor.
possibly.
because--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--because
there
are...
there
are
any
number
of
different
payroll
arrangements.
a
calendar
week...
and
congress
used
the
term,
"calendar
week",
in
this
definition.
i
think
that's
fairly
easily
understood.
a
calendar
week
does
not
vary.
however,
pay
periods
could
vary
widely.
not
every
employer
pays--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--under...
under--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--under
a
weekly
payroll
system,
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
think...
i
think
what
we're
focusing,
though...
what
we're
focusing
on,
though,
here
is
a
daily
payroll,
in
terms
of
measuring
the
size
of
the
employer's
work
force
on
a
particular
day.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
there...
there
are
two
points--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--i...
i...
i
am
from
illinois,
your
honor.
[laughter]
however,
i
was
only
3--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--there...
there...
there
are
two
points
i'd
like
to
make
in...
in
response
to...
to
your
honor's
question.
first
of
all,
the...
while
the
implementation
of
the
daily
method,
at
first
blush,
might
appear
to
be
burdensome,
it's
really
not.
first
of
all,
we're
only
talking
about,
though,
that
small
number
of
employers
who
are...
who
are
on
the
cusp.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
the
discovery
focused
not
entirely
in
this
case,
your
honor,
upon
how
to
count
individuals.
in
fact,
much
of
the
discovery
in
this
case,
perhaps
due
to
the
circuit
split,
was
calculated
to
try
to
find
or
to
identify
other
individuals
out
there
who
could
potentially
be
counted
as
employees,
thereby
avoiding
the
counting
problem.
that
was...
that
was
a...
a
large
part
of
the...
of
the
discovery.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
in
any
case--
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
--in...
in
any
such
case,
your
honor,
the...
the
battleground,
if
you
will,
could...
could
shift.
mr.
patrick
j.
falahee,
jr.
thank
you.
