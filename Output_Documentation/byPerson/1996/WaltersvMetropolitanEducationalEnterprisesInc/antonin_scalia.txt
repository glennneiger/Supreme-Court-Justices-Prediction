justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it...
what
does
it
mean
when
the
statute
says
that
the
eeoc...
it
not
only
does
not
specifically
confer
rulemaking
authority
on
the
eeoc,
but
it
specifically
denies
rulemaking
authority
to
the
eeoc?
isn't...
isn't
that
a
reflection
in
the
statute
that
the
eeoc
is
not
to
be
given
the...
the
authority
to
give
content
to
the
statute
that
most
agencies
possess?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
said
that
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
that
any
different?
i
mean
skidmore...
skidmore
is,
what,
1944
or
something
like
that...
pre-administrative
procedure
act.
and...
and
does
it
refer
to...
when
it
talks
of
deference,
does
it
mean
anything
other
than
the
deference
we
would
give
to,
for
example,
unanimity
of
opinion
among
respected
academic
commentators?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
williston
and
corbin,
and
if...
if...
you
give
certain
deference
to
their
views.
does
it
mean
anything
more
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
rational
force
and
not
authoritative
effect,
which
is
what
chevron
talks
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
more
specifically,
you're
talking
about
the
portion
of
the
scheme
that
creates
a
small
business
exemption.
do
you
think
it
makes
much
sense
to
call
a
business
a
small
business
if
it
has
15
full-time
employees
who
come
in
5
days
a
week,
but...
i'm
sorry...
14,
who...
who
come
in
5
days
a
week,
call
it
a
small
business,
and
therefore
not
covered
by
this;
but
if
it
has
the
same
product,
the
same
total
amount
of
work,
but,
instead,
has
28
people,
each
of
whom
do
part-time
work,
and...
and
come
in
only
half
a
week,
then
it
becomes
a
large
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
much
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does...
what
does
the
term
"part-time
employee"
mean?
doesn't
it
suggest
that
you're...
you're
not
an
employee
full-time?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you
suggested
that
all
employees
are
full-time
employees,
even
if
they're
part-time
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you...
you
can
produce
absurd
results
under
either
theory;
will...
will
you
concede
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
either
theory
will
produce
some?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
"weeks"
alone
would
do
that.
you
didn't...
you
wouldn't
have
to
say
"for
each
working
day".
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
but
that
difference
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
seasonality
versus
nonseasonality.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
20-week
provision,
by
itself,
takes
care
of
the
seasonal
worker
problem.
and...
and
"for
each
working
day"
just...
just
decides,
both
for
seasonal
workers
and
nonseasonal
workers,
you
know,
how
many
people
you're
going
to
be
counting.
but
i
don't
see
how--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"#
each
working
day"
has
anything
to
do
with
seasonality.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
do.
[laughter]
but
tell...
tell
me...
tell
me
why,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i--
--of
course,
the...
the
regulations
under
the
family
and
medical
leave
act,
if
they
are
interpreting
the
very
language
that
exists
here,
and
if
we
were
to
interpret
that
language
as
meaning
it...
it
is
not
the
payroll
plan,
but
it's
the
day-by-day
system
that
you
advocate,
it
may
well
be
that
the
regulations
under
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
would
exceed
the
agency's
authority.
it
would
just
be
unreasonable.
i
mean,
if...
if
there
is
in...
that
inconsistency,
what
that
inconsistency
may...
may
well
prove
is
the
invalidity
of
the
regulations
under
the
other
act,
not
the
invalidity
of
your
position
under
this
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
you
would.
[laughter]
may
i
ask
you--
--but,
mr.
falahee,
you...
you
do
recognize
that
there
is
at
least
some
legislative
history
that
some
people
might
read
that
seems
very
heavily
to
support
the...
what
has
been
called
the
payroll
method
in
connection
with
the
family
leave
act?
i
mean
there's
a
blank
for
title
vii.
we
don't
why
they
wrote
those
words.
but
for
the
family
leave
act,
we
do
have
legislative
history,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
wouldn't
be
covered
if...
if
the...
if
the
business
stayed
open
a
fifth
day
and
brought
in
only
one
employee,
right?
in
fact,
that'd
be
a
very
good
way
of
making
sure
you're
not
covered;
just
keep
the
business
open
on
saturday
and...
and
have
one
employee
come
in,
even
for
1
hour
on
saturday?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
smart.
i'd
advise
a
client
to
do
it--
[laughter]
--theoretically
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
you
don't
really
say
"presence".
that's
not
the...
the...
you
would
say
"compensation",
because
you
count
salaried
workers
who
get
compensated
for
that
day,
whether
they
show
up
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
also...
you
also
count
workers
who
are
on
paid
vacation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
really...
the...
the
employer
relationship
you
focus
on
is
compensation
for
that
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is...
but
that
is
compensation.
why
don't
you
give
this
one
away?
i
mean--
[laughter]
--if,
indeed,
the
christmas
bonus
is
based
on
a
day-by-day
computation,
and
if
you
were
there
x
number
of
days
you
get
a
higher
bonus,
you're
being
compensated
for
that
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
count...
you
would
count
that,
then?
anyway,
my
point
is
you
don't
have
to
be
there.
you
just
have
to
be
on
the
payroll?
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
were
done
that
way,
and
you
were
getting
compensation
for
that
friday,
even
though
you
didn't
come
to
work,
you
would
have
to
count
it
under
your
system,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
there
is
such
a
crazy
christmas
bonus
system,
then
you
count
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
you're...
you're...
you're
in
trouble
once
you
assume
that
"for
each
working
day"
has
a
substantial
meaning
apart
from
the
one
that
you
want
to
give
it.
and
i'm
surprised
that
you...
you
conceded
so
quickly
that...
that
a...
a...
a
valid
purpose
of
it
is
to
define
the
workweek.
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you're
using
a
3-day
workweek
or
a
7-day
workweek,
if
all
you're
looking
at
is
the
payroll?
unless
it's
the...
you
know,
the
negligible
consequence
of
people
who
happen
to
come
on
or
off
at
some
point
during
the
week,
what...
why
would
the
statute
make
no
sense
if
it...
if
it
said
20
weeks
and
it
meant
calendar
weeks?
wouldn't
the
statute
be
perfectly
implemental...
implementable
under
a
payroll
system?
do
you
have
to
define
what
the
workweek
is
if
you're
using
a
payroll
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you
understand
my
question.
i
just
don't
see
why,
if
you're
using
a...
a
payroll
system,
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
workweek
is
3...
is
3
or
7.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
payroll
is
going
to
be
there
the
whole
week
anyway,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
the
legislative
history
there.
you--
[laughter]
