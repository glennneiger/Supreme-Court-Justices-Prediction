justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr....
mr.
gekas,
may
i
interrupt
just
to
ask
if
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
correctly?
you
were
saying
that
your
interpretation...
let's
forget
about
deference...
of
this
statute
coincides
in...
with
that
of
the
eeoc?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
we
got
back...
but
what
you're
saying
is
that,
suppose
there
were
no
eeoc,
that
is
the
interpretation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
one
that
they
put
forward--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
also
the
one
that
you
put
forward?
but
there's
one
thing
that
you
also
said
in
your
response
to
justice
o'connor
that
puzzled
me,
because
i
thought
both
your
interpretation
and
the
eeoc's
required
that
somebody
be
a
current
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
someone...
the
computer
had
to
take
their
name
off
the
payroll.
i
mean,
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
you
said
is
you
could
be
working
for
the
company
10
years,
you
leave
on
a
friday,
you're
not
counted
that
week?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no,
not...
not
the
retaliation.
whether...
whether
you
count
somebody--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
working
for
that
week--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
that
person
is
discharged
or
quits
on
thursday?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now...
now,
i
would
like
to
ask
what
sense
it
would
make
to
take
your
person
who
comes
in
once
a
month
for
one
hour
and
say...
count
that
person,
but
not
count
the
person
who
has
worked,
let's
say,
10
hours
a
day
for
4
days,
but
leaves
the
job
permanently
on
the
fifth
day?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
someone
could
be
an
employee...
a
part-time
employee
is
an
employee
for
purposes
of
bringing
a
title
vii
complaint.
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
person
is
an
employee
for
the
15-person
count.
you
yourself
have
said
strongly,
in
your
brief,
that
the
word
"employee"
can
mean
different
things
in
different
contexts.
and
so,
of
course,
the
answer
is
yes
to
your,
is
this
person
an
employee
for
purposes
of
filing
a
discrimination
charge?
but
the
question
is:
would
such
person
be
an
employee
for
the
purpose
of
the
15--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
on
that
question,
i
would
like
to
ask
you,
on
your
reading,
what
purpose
congress
could
have
had...
you
say,
well,
we
do
give
meaning
to
this
phrase,
"for
each
working
day".
our
meaning
is,
if
you
work
10
years,
but
you
leave
employment
on
a
thursday,
you're
not
counted
that
week.
or
if
you
start
on
a
tuesday
instead
of
a
monday,
you're
not
counted.
why
would
congress
want
to
exclude
those
people?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
only
question
i
asked.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
well,
first,
tell
me
what...
what
meaning
you
give
to
those
words--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
you
just
gave
me
an
answer
that
i
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
counter
to
what
you
say
in
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
falahee,
was...
was
there
any
model
for
that?
i
mean,
the...
the
eeoc
does
point
us
to
this
unemployment
compensation
act
to
support
their
way
of
counting.
was
there
any
other
statute
before
title
vii
that
said
you're
not...
you
don't
count
as
an
employee
unless
you...
you
are
there
every
day
of
the
workweek?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
what
those
words...
at
least
some
legislators...
thought
they
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
falahee,
i'm
confused
by
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
because
i
thought
that
it
would
be
the
other
way
on
your
method.
that
is,
take
someone's
5-day
week...
regular
5-day
week...
but
this
person
works
10
hours
a
day,
4
days
a
week.
i
thought,
under
your
method,
that
person
would
not
count
as
an
employee,
because
that
person
is...
is
not
employed
for
each
working
day?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
doesn't
come
in
on
friday.
but
the...
the
question
that
i
have
is
you
have
15
every
day
for...
for
4
days.
most
of
them
work
8
hours.
but
there's
one
person
who
works
10
hours,
and
so
doesn't
come
in
on
the
last
day.
so,
on
the
last...
the
fifth
day,
they're
only
14
people.
i
thought,
under
your
method,
that
employee...
employee...
that
employer
is
not
employing
15
or
more
people
for
each
working
day;
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
in
any
week,
somebody
who
comes
in
4
days
a
week,
10
hours
a
day,
is
not
counted
as
an
employee
for
that
week
for
this
purpose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is...
but
that
individual
would
never
be
someone
who
has
worked
for
each
working
day.
so
if
you
had
that
person
the
whole
year...
just
what
i
described...
15
people,
but
one
of
them
works
4
days
a
week,
10
hours
a
day,
that
employer
would
not
come
within
title
vii,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
employer
would
not
be
covered
by
title
vii,
because
it
would
not
have
15
or
more
employees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
telling
me
that
an
employer...
same
number
of
hours,
but
somebody
who
works
4
days
a
week...
is
never
counted...
will
never
qualify
that
employer,
whereas
somebody
who
worked
for
that...
who...
who
worked
2
hours
a
day
each
day
a
week,
that
employer
would
be
under
title
vii...
if
i
understand
your
method
correctly...
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
so,
on...
on
one
day,
if
you
have
14
workers--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
you're
missing
the
worker
who
was
there
10
hours
a
day
for
4
days--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
one
employer.
that
employer
is
not
covered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
then,
you
have
another
employer
who
has
the
same
14
who
show
up
for
8
hours
a
day,
and
then
a
15th
who
comes
in
every
day
for
2
hours,
that
one
is
covered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
include
part-time
people,
too.
and
under
your
method,
you
can
include
a
part-time
person
who
works
1
hour
a
day,
5
days
a
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah,
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
thinking,
here's
a
statute...
it
can
mean
one
thing,
it
can
mean
another
thing.
there's
no
legislative
history
to
help.
and
there
are
these
various
ways.
returning
to
justice
breyer's
question,
why
don't
you
say
congress
is
regulating
business;
it's
reasonable
to
think
that
they
would
pick
the
easiest
and
not
the
hardest
way
of
counting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wholly
apart
from
deference.
if
we
got
these
ways...
and
i'm
ask...
which
one
would
you
pick?
all
other
things
being
equal,
i'd
pick
the
one
that's
easiest
for
a
business
person
to
administer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
there's
no
contest
on
that.
i
mean,
if
you
said,
well,
it
wasn't
so
much
of
a
problem,
but
there
was--
