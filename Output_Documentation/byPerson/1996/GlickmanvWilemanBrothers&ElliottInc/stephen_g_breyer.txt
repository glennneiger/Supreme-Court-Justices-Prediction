well,
what
is
the
difference
between...
you
say
what
is
the
problem.
there's
a
regulatory
problem.
if
you
think
this
program
is
unjustified
i
guess
you
can
go
to
the
courts
and
say,
it's
arbitrary,
capricious,
abuse
of
discretion,
and
get
it
thrown
out,
right?
all
right.
we're
talking
about
the
first
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
first
amendment
problem
that
your
client
has
that
wouldn't
be
shared
by
anybody
who
used
to
fly
on
the
airlines
and
had
to
pay
money
in
part
for
messages
that
they
might
have
disagreed
with
that
would
have
been
spent
by
the
air
transport
association
required
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
or
exactly
the
same
thing
in
the
utilities
industry,
or
the
trucking
industry,
or
any
taxpayer
who
pays
taxes
which
then
is
spent
by
the
government
on
messages
they
disagree
with?
in
other
words,
what's
the
first
amendment
interest
here
that
isn't
shared
in
thousands
of
regulatory
situations
by
millions
of
members
of
the
public
whose
money
the
government
often
takes
to
spend,
or
have
other
private
people
spend,
on
messages
that
they
might
not
want
to
pay
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
they
didn't...
i'm
saying
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
the
interstate
commerce
commission...
i
mean,
i
thought
the
constitution
would
permit
the
public,
mistaken
or
not,
to
have
regulatory
systems
to
regulate
every
industry,
perhaps,
if
they
wanted
to,
to
have
a
nonfree
enterprise
system
perhaps
if
they
didn't
want
to.
i
don't
know.
i
thought
those
were
basically
democratic
questions.
but
if
we
have
a
system
where
the
industry
is
regulated,
i'm
asking
what
is
the
first
amendment
interest
that
is
different
from
the
same
first
amendment
interest
of
every
flier,
every
customer
of
a
trucker,
every
customer
of
a
utility...
i'm
just
repeating
myself,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
vast
numbers
of
consumers
who
used
to
have
to
spend
lots
of
money
they
didn't
want
to
spend
for
messages
that
regulators
would
either
permit
or
require.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
you
would
point
out,
i
suppose,
that
you're
not
objecting
to
expenditure
of
money
for
advertising
or
for
any
other
purpose
by
the
government.
the
united
states
doesn't
contend
in
this
case
that
these
are
government
expenditures,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
picture
of
this
little
girl
running
in
a
sprinkler
eating
a
nectarine?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you
that
a
peach
is
not
a
peach.
i
really
do.
[laughter]
i
mean,
absolutely.
i
love
those
juicy
peaches
which
you
can
hardly
ever
get.
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
also
concerned
about
turning
first
amendment
district
courts
into
regulatory
agencies,
and
therefore
i'm
worried
about
this
problem
of
the
air...
i
promise
you
i
disagreed
a
lot
with
what
the
air
transport
association
might
have
advertised.
in
the
rate
base
the
customer
pays,
and
i
pay
for
it
a
flyer.
that's
what
i'm
worried
about.
now,
you
brought
up
pg&e
as
a
precedent,
but
then
i
look
at
pg&e
and
i
look
at
it
and
think,
my
goodness,
that
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
more
clear
first
amendment
problem,
because
it
was
the
company's
property.
the
company
had
to
put
the
message
in
the
envelope.
it
was
absolutely
clear
that
the
company
was
underwriting
this
message
with
which
it
disagreed,
rather
than
analogize
it
to
like
a
public
forum.
so
i'd
like
you
to
talk
a
little
bit
more
about
that
case,
because
as
i
looked
at
that
plurality
opinion
quickly,
it
seemed
to
me
that
yours
was
a
more
attenuated
interest
by
a
long
shot
than
the
interest
there,
but
i
raise
that
so
you
can
discuss
it.
