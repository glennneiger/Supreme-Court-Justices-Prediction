what
is
the
test
that
you
say
we
must
apply
to
determine
the
validity
of
this
provision
requiring
advertising?
do
we
have
to
find
that
there
is
a
real,
substantial
harm,
and
that
this
is
a
provision
that's
narrowly
tailored
to
eliminate
it,
or
is
the
standard
that's
applied
something
far
more
deferential?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
speech
is
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
speech
is
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
jenkins--
--well,
in
a
commercial
speech
context
it
seems
to
me
that
you
don't
have
to
establish
a
very
clear
governmental
interest
in
order
to
prevail.
if
it's
simply
commercial
speech
necessary
to
move
a
line
of
goods,
isn't
that
the
end
of
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
case,
the
closest
case
that
you
have
to
suggest
the
proper
standard
that
we
should
use
here?
which
case,
turner
broadcasting,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
the
zauderer
case?
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
don't
sponsor
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
you're
forced
to
associate,
using
your
term,
by
the
terms
of
the
marketing
order
anyway.
if
there
were
no
promotional
advertising
you'd
be
"forced
to
associate".
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
program
that
i
think,
insofar
as
its
regulatory
mechanisms
other
than
promotion,
is
clearly
lawful
and
valid
and
constitutional,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
building
on
that
base.
once
you
have
in
place
a
marketing
order,
a
marketing
system,
it
seems
to
me
logical
that
that
marketing
entity
engage
in
generic
advertising.
i
don't
see
why
the
advertising
suddenly
causes
a
forced
association
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
already
associated,
whether
you
like
it
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
the
marketing
order
without
the
promotional
aspects
of
it
helps
everybody
to
market
their
peaches,
i
suppose
you're
helping
to
market
red
jim
through
the
marketing
order.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
given
the
fact
that
you
are
therefore
in
a
common
marketing
entity
anyway,
it
seems
to
me
to
much
diminish
your
first
amendment
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whether
you
like
it
or
not,
big
growers
may
be
helping
smaller
growers
to
market
their
products,
and
maybe
that's
not
cost-effective
for
you
and
you'd
rather
have
something
else,
but
you
begin
with
the
premise
that
this
is
a
valid
program.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
weren't
these
peaches--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--weren't
the
peaches
selected
because
of
the
volume?
doesn't
the
chart
which
lists
all
the
peaches
reflect
the
volume
of
peaches
that
were
sold
through
the
marketing
entity?
wasn't
that
the
criteria
for
inclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
was
based
on
volume.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
a
finding
to
that
effect,
that
that's
the
necessary
purport
of
those
ads,
or
can
we
just
tell
it
from
the...
from
reading
the
ads?
