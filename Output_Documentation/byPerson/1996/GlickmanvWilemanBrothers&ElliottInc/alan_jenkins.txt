mr.
alan
jenkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
respondents'
challenge
on
first
amendment
grounds,
payments
toward
advertising
designed
to
promote
the
products
that
they
offer
for
sale,
whether
they're
measured
under
the
integrated
bar
and
union
line
of
cases
that
we
believe
is
appropriate,
or
under
the
central
hudson
test
for
restrictions
on
commercial
speech,
the
generic
advertising
programs
pass
constitutional
muster.
in
our
view,
the
regulatory
framework
at
issue
here
is
most
analogous
to
the
integrated
bar
and
union
context.
this
court
has
applied
the
central
hudson
test
where
government
has
restricted
or
prohibited
the
dissemination
of
truthful
commercial
information,
but
the
marketing
order
provisions
at
issue
here
do
not
ban,
suppress,
or
restrict
respondents'
speech
in
any
way.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
don't--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
in
fact,
the
government
has
argued
throughout
this
litigation
that
these
programs
satisfy
both
central
hudson
and
the
abood
line
of
cases.
we...
pardon
me.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
our
position
below.
i
believe
that
in
our
briefs
in
the
district
court
in
particular
we
argued
expressly
that
the
abood
standard
was
satisfied
and
that
the
central
hudson
test
was
satisfied.
it
is
true
that
we
did
not
argue
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
was
the
only
appropriate
test,
but
i
do
think
that
we've
argued
consistently
that
both
tests
are
satisfied.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
you've
said,
it's
true
that
we
were
laboring
under
the
adverse
precedent
in
cal-almond,
where
the
central
hudson
test
was
applied,
but
we
did
refer
to
the
frame
case
from
the
third
circuit,
which
did
rely
in
part
on
abood,
so
i
think
that
argument
is
preserved.
mr.
alan
jenkins
quite
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
certainly
the
case.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
think
it's
the
latter,
justice
souter,
but
i
think
it's
even
broader
than
that.
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
expressly
sets
out
the
goals
of
that
statute
and
of
the
marketing
orders,
which
include
establishing
orderly
market
conditions
for
the
covered
commodities.
congress,
as
in
the
integrated
bar
context
and
as
in
the
union
context,
has
chose
to
leave
in
the
first
instance
to
the
regulated
industry
the
determination
whether,
in
a
particular
region,
as
for
a
particular
commodity,
that
interest
is
threatened,
but
we
think
that
both
the
overwhelming
support
by
the
industry
and
the
record
in
this
case
indicate
that
that
interest
was
certainly
implicated
here.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
but
that
just
is
at
the
core
of
the
government's
interest.
where
private
industry
and,
i
would
add,
the
secretary
has
to
make
a
determination
that
private...
that
generic
advertising
would
further...
tend
to
further
the
interest
of
the
act,
that
is
because
in
a
particular
region,
under
a
particular
marketing
order,
the
need
exists.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
think
that's
true,
justice
souter,
but
i'd
also
like--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--it
does
not,
and
let
me
make
clear
the
way
in
which
this
act
operates.
mr.
alan
jenkins
justice
ginsburg,
as
i've
said,
first
the
broader
interest
is
in
orderly
market
conditions.
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act,
the
1954
legislative
history
of
the
adoption
of
promotional
programs,
and
the
record
of
the
formal
rulemaking
that
gave
birth
to
the
advertising
provisions
of
the
marketing
orders
indicate
the
economic
hardship
that
results
and
the
economic
instability
in
the
nation
as
a
whole
that
results
when
there's
wide
fluctuation
of
market
prices,
when
particularly
farmers
but
other
elements
of
the
industry--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
i
think
that
relates
to
my
answer
to
justice
souter's
previous
question,
which
is
that
taking,
for
example,
that
one
of
the
proposed
disparities
is
between
california-grown
peaches
and
georgia-grown
peaches...
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
regulatory
framework
here,
which
is
commodity-specific,
and
region-specific.
taking
peaches
as
an
example,
first,
california
is
responsible
for
the
majority
of
peaches
that
wind
up
on
people's
shelves,
but
more
importantly,
between
two
different
regions
there
are
vast
disparities
in
labor
costs,
in
quality.
the
length
of
the
season
in
california
is
much
longer.
california-grown
peaches
have
a
nationwide
market,
whereas
georgia-grown
peaches
are
basically
locally
grown
and
consumed
along
the
eastern
seaboard.
there
are
transportation
costs
that
are
different.
there
are
investment
costs
that
are
different.
but
i
think
the
particularized
nature,
commodity-specific
nature
and
region-specific
nature
of
these
marketing
orders
reflects
narrow
tailoring
rather
than
arbitrariness,
but
justice--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
that's
not
entirely
true,
justice
souter,
insofar
as
the
marketing...
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
treats
different
commodities
in
different
regions
differently,
but
you're
certainly
correct
that
it's
the
industry
in
the
first
instance,
a
supermajority,
two-thirds
majority
producers,
that
caused
the
marketing
order
to
come
into
being.
that's
because
congress
i
think
reasonably
has
determined
that
people
in
the
industry,
operating
day-to-day,
are
the
best
measure
of
need.
mr.
alan
jenkins
pardon
me.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
think
so,
justice
scalia,
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
at
footnote
3,
congress
since
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
has
reaffirmed
the
importance
of
these
programs
and,
in
fact,
expanded
them
and
made
significant
factual
findings
regarding
their
importance,
but...
pardon
me.
mr.
alan
jenkins
has
not
done
it
for
every
commodity,
that's
true.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
don't
think
so.
again,
if
i
can--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
determination
first
is
that
there
may
not
be
significant
market
disorder
and
fluctuation
in
those
industries
where...
private
industry
where
producers
have
not
felt
a
need
to
invoke
the
government's
aid,
but
if
i
can
analogize--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
for
example,
there
are
a
number
of
commodities
for
which
marketing
orders
are
authorized,
but
where
the
industry
has
not
chosen
to
use
them,
to
ask
for
them.
in
plums,
for
example,
in
1991
the
california...
the
aspects
of
the
marketing
order
that
relate
to
plums
were
terminated
because
there
was
an
industry-wide
referendum
and
plum
producers
found
that
it
was
no
longer
important.
but
if
i
could
again
analogize
to
the
union
context,
not
every
workplace
is
unionized.
it's
only
where
a
majority
of
workers
feel
that
a
union
will
effectuate
their
interest
and
therefore
congress'
interest
in
labor
peace.
mr.
alan
jenkins
we
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
particularly
as
to
these
commodities
that
is
true.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
certainly
true
as
a
technical
matter,
your
honor,
but
it's
also
true
that
in
adopting
both...
in
adopting
promotional
programs
congress
found,
and
in
adopting
these
particular
marketing
order
provisions
the
secretary
found
that
these...
the
ability
to
invoke
generic
advertising
activities
has
a
beneficial
effect,
and
in
fact
directly
advances--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
it
is
more
deferential,
but
if
i
could
set
back
for
a
moment,
i
think
that
if
certainly
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
regulating
these
commodities
and
establishing
orderly
market
conditions
in
terms
of
its
effect
on
the
national
economy
was
a
trivial
interest,
then
the
government
would
lose
in
this
case.
i
think
there's
no--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
insofar
as
the
first
amendment
rights
of
handlers
are
affected,
then
there
must
be,
i
suppose,
more
than
an
irrational
governmental
interest,
but
i
think
there's
no
question
that
the
interest
here
is
substantial.
if...
insofar
as
your
question
about
what
test
should
apply,
we
do
think
it's
more
deferential.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
yes.
the
court
has--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--no,
your
honor,--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--zauderer,
insofar
as
the
central
hudson
test
commercial
speech
analysis
is
applicable,
zauderer
would
probably
be
the
closest
case
insofar
as
it
involved
the
aspect
of
compelled
disclosure
of
information,
as
distinguished
from
restrictions
on
speech,
but
we
think
that
the
speech
interests
in
this
case
are
attenuated
in
several
respects,
first
because
it's
commercial
speech,
second
because
there's
no
restriction
on
respondent's
ability
to
advertise
in
any
respect,
third
because--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--your
honor,
we
do,
but
let
me
first
say
that
i
think--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
justice
o'connor,
if
that
were
the
dominant
or
even
perhaps
a
plurality
of--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--pardon
me.
mr.
alan
jenkins
justice
o'connor,
we
would--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
suppose
my
answer
is
no.
mr.
alan
jenkins
we
do
not
defend
an
overarching
governmental
goal
of
advertising
a
particular
competitor's--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
it's
important
to
look...
in
our,
in
the
joint
appendix
in
volume
2,
at
page
531,
this
is
the
varieties
chart
to
which
respondents
were
referring,
and
among
the
list
of
many,
many
varieties,
there
is
included
the
red
jim
which,
as
you
pointed
out,
is
a
proprietary
variety--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--shipped
by
only
one
handler.
mr.
alan
jenkins
now,
we
think
that
this
is
an
infinitesimal
aspect
of
this
program.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
the
expectation
of
the
way
in
which
this
program
operates,
and
i--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--the
growers
vote
in
the
first
instance
to
terminate.
i
would
note,
however,
that
in
adopting
the
advertising
provisions
of
this
marketing
order
handlers
also--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct,
and
let
me--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
there
are
periodic
referenda,
i
believe
every
4
years,
and
in
the
last
referenda
there
was
overwhelming
support
for
this
program,
i
believe
between
75
and
83
percent.
mr.
alan
jenkins
we
don't,
justice
scalia,
assert
that
there's
something
comparable
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation
in
this
context,
although
that
is
similarly
true
in
the
integrated
bar
context,
that
there
is
no
concomitant
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
justice
scalia,
i
also
think
that
the
majority
cannot,
as
an
overwhelming,
either
as
a
goal
or
as
the
effect
harm
the
minority's
interest.
there
are
significant
safeguards
in
place,
both
regulatory
and
statutory,
to
ensure
that
there
is
not
overwhelming
harm
or
even
significant
harm
to
handlers
as
individuals.
i'd
also
point
out
in
the
integrated--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
alan
jenkins
but
justice
scalia,
i
don't
see
how
that
removes
this
from
the
abood
line
of
cases.
it's
similarly
true
that
if
i'm
an
employee
and
i'm
opposed
to
maternity
leave,
and
the
union
nonetheless
negotiates
a
maternity
leave
clause
in
our
contract,
i
have
no
first
amendment
right
to
prevent
that.
although
i
feel
that
i'm
being
harmed
and
my,
both
my
first
amendment
interests,
i
feel,
and
my
practical
interests
are
being
harmed,
there's
no
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
nor
is
there
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
if
it
were,
in
fact,
an
important
governmental
interest--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
i--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--no
comment
on
that,
but
i
do
think
that...
of
course,
it's
up
to
this
court
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
the
interest
that
congress
in
this
case
seeks
to
achieve
is
an
important
or
a
substantial
one.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
just
have
a
two-part
answer
to
that.
first,
i
think
that
the
other
things
that
these
marketing
orders
allow
have
to
do
with
increasing
consumption.
they're
not
safety
and
health
regulations.
those
are
regulated
through
a
different
set
of
programs.
so
the
question
is,
if
there's
an
adequate
justification
for
those
aspects,
does
the
availability
of
generic
marketing,
generic
advertising,
also
help
to
achieve
that
goal?
the
question...
pardon
me.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
under
this
court's
cases
the
question
has
not
been,
is
the
means
toward
the
end
as
important,
is
one
means
as
important
as
another,
but
first
is
the
end
important
and
then,
secondly,
does
the
means
chosen
advance
the
end,
and
so
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
does
demonstrate
that
the
end
of
orderly
market
conditions
and
sustained
demand
for
these
products
is
significantly
advanced
by
the
means
that's
chosen,
including
generic
advertising.
mr.
alan
jenkins
justice
souter,
let
me
answer
the
second
part
of
your
question
first.
you
asked
earlier
about
the
record.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
here
the
government
was
defending
a
particular
program,
and
so
the
record
doesn't
reflect,
for
example,
why
georgia
peaches
are
not
regulated.
as
i've
indicated,
there
are
reasons
why
different
markets
are
treated
differently,
but
the
record
doesn't
reflect
it
because
in
our
view
our
burden
is
to
demonstrate
that
this
program
satisfies
constitutional
requirements,
and
we
think
that
the
evidence
amply
demonstrates
first
that
advertising,
generic
advertising
programs
advance
the
interest
of
consumer
demand
for
these
products,
and
in
fact--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
and
both
of
the
courts
below
found
that,
and
that
secondly,
viewed
in
the
context
of
this
act,
it
provides
the
secretary
and
the
commodity
committees
with
a
tool
for
influencing
consumer
preferences,
and
i
think
it's
the
inevitable...
the
conclusion
is
inevitable
that
that
aids
in
regulating
market
conditions.
if
the
secretary...
insofar
as
the
secretary--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
think
that's
generally
correct,
but
i
would
also
note--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
i
was
just
going
to
say
it's
also
the
case
that
these
markets
are
very
different,
so
that
if
there
is
sufficient
demand--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--we
don't,
justice
souter,
but
as
i've
said,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
know
that
in
order
to
answer
the
question
that's
at
issue
here.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
record
in
the
frame
case
was
quite
similar,
but
the
program
was
somewhat
different.
the
beef
program
focuses
almost
exclusively
on
promotional
programs
and
advertising,
and
so
insofar
as
congress
perceived
a
problem
and
the
only
thing
it
did
about
it
was
to
create
promotional
advertising
programs,
the
third
circuit
concluded
correctly,
we
think,
that
there
was
a
problem
existing
that
congress
sought
to
address.
here,
congress
has
used
a
larger
number
of
tools,
but--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
think
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
incorrect.
i
think
the
district
court
in
particular
made
findings
as
to
the
type
of
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at,
and
in
fact
cites
the
congressional
record
indicating
that
there
were
in
fact
gluts
of
supply,
that
there
was
suppressed
demand--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--congress
was
citing...
pardon
me.
the
district
court
was
citing
congress'
findings,
but
let
me
be
clear--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--was
citing
the
congressional
record
reports,
and--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--some
were
from
reports--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
act
itself
there's
a
congressional
finding
that
programs
are
necessary,
that--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
think
it
is
comparable,
but
i
want
to
be
specific,
because
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
congress
made
findings
both
in
1937,
when
it
adopted
the
act,
and
then
in
1954,
when
it
added
promotional
programs,
not
advertising
specifically.
it...
congress
subsequently
added
advertising
as
among
the
promotional
programs,
and
we
think
congress
was
not
required
to
make
additional
findings,
as
when
it
had
already
indicated
what
it
found
promotional
programs
to
accomplish.
it's
also
true
that
in
the
formal
rulemaking
by
the
secretary
the
record,
when
the
advertising
specifically
was
adopted,
their
extensive
findings...
in
fact,
even
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
were
extensive
findings
in
rejecting
respondent's
apa
challenge,
that
this
type
of
advertising
did
effectuate
the
goals
of
the
act.
that's
a
statutory
requirement.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
jenkins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
begin
just
very
briefly
by
stating
that
as
to
the
administration
of
this
program
most
of
the
factual
findings
that
respondent's
cite
come
from
the
alj's
findings
on
the
apa
claim
against
these
programs.
those
were
overturned
by
the
judicial
officer,
who
found
those
findings
as
to
bias,
as
to
red
is
better,
and
what-have-you,
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
both
of
the
courts
below
affirmed
that
holding,
the
apa
holding,
and
so
i
think
those
findings
are
simply
out
of
the
case.
the
court
need
not
necessarily
ignore
them
completely,
but
no
final
adjudication
has
been
made
upholding
these
findings
of
bias.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
question
of
the
government
interest
here,
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
that
there's
a
free
rider
problem
that's
important
and
comparable
to
the
union
and
integrated
bar
context,
that
in
agriculture,
and
particularly
as
to
these
commodities,
there
are
many
small
producers
who
could
not
engage
in
the
kind
of
economies
of
scale
that's
available
under
this
program.
that's
not
necessarily
true
in
some
other
industries.
the
record
does
speak,
for
instance,
to
the
california
almond
industry,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
where
congress
finds
a
problem
and
deals
with
it
in
a
way
that
is
constitutionally
justifiable,
the
fact,
at
least
outside
of
the
strict
scrutiny
context,
that
it
has
not
chosen
to
employ
those
remedies
elsewhere
does
not
render
unconstitutional
its
action
where
it
has
done
so.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
think
so,
justice
scalia,
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
alan
jenkins
may
i
complete
my
answer?
mr.
alan
jenkins
the
amaa
provides
that
the
secretary
must
find
that
particular
activities
are...
tend
to
effectuate
the
goals
of
the
act.
the
agricultural
marketing
service
has
guidelines
which,
for
instance,
prevent
the
criticism
of
other
commodities
or
products,
so
i
think
both
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
a
legal
matter
there
are
checks
on
misuse
of
this
system.
thank
you.
