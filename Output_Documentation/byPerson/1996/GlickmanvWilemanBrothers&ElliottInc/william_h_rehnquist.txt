chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1184,
dan
glickman,
secretary
of
agriculture
v.
wileman
brothers
and
elliott,
inc.--
mr.
jenkins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
both
of
those
lines
of
cases,
of
course,
deal
with
the
first
amendment,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
at
least,
or
couldn't
congress
find
as
a
fact
that
in
agriculture,
at
least
since
after
the
first
world
war,
there's
always
been
a
problem.
if
there's
a
good
crop
the
prices
are
low,
and
if
the
prices
are
good,
there's
virtually
no
crop.
it's
a
totally
different
situation
from
most
other
kinds
of
marketed
goods.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
that
could
justify
the
marketing
orders,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
support
with
any
necessity
the
advertising.
you
could
have
marketing
orders
and
try
to
organize
the
market
without
any
government
advertising.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jenkins,
supposing
there's
such
a
thing
as
the
beer
institute,
which
is
a
private
organization
devoted
to
generic
advertising
for
beer,
and
supposing
some
of
its
members
feel
that
some
of
the
micro
breweries
who
aren't
members
are
kind
of
free-riding
on
the
generic,
could
the
beer
institute
go
to
congress
and
say,
look,
we
want
to
have
a
kind
of
a
marketing
agreement
and
some
generic
advertising.
we
want
to
bring
these
freeloaders
on
board,
so
let's
assess
everybody
who
produces
any
beer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
sure
the
beer
people
would
think
it
was.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jenkins.
mr.
campagne,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--just
a
minute,
mr.
campagne.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
terribly
helpful
to
simply
hold
up
a
brief
and
say
that
stipulation
number
59...
we
don't
know
what...
if
you
want
to
make
a
point,
make
it
so
that
we
can
all
understand
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
say
exclusively
in
what
i'm
reading.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
connection
with
that,
mr.
campagne,
you
don't
have
to
attack
here
the
various
health
inspection
provisions,
the
pro
rata
provisions,
that
sort
of
thing,
and
i
take
it
you're
not
challenging
the
basic
congressional
authority
to
enact
something
like
that.
you're
simply
trying
to
separate
out
the
advertising
provision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
also
distinguish
between
regulations
which
don't
have
any
speech
import
to
them,
like
quality
and
so
on,
plus
some
sort
of
regulation
that
forces
you
to
spend
money
for
speech?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
campagne.
mr.
jenkins,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jenkins.
the
case
is
submitted.
