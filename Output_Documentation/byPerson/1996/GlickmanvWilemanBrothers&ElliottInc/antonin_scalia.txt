justice

mr.
jenkins--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
we
have
to
believe...
this
argument
sounds
like
something
time-warped
out
of
the
1920's.
the
thirties.
or
the
thirties.
[laughter]
and
this
is
a
remnant
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
when
this
kind
of
an
argument
was
made
for
every
industry
in
the
country,
and
indeed,
they
tried
to
have
marketing,
the
equivalent
of
marketing
orders
for
every
industry
in
the
country.
it
was
found
not
to
be
true
and
not
to
be
effective.
now,
do
we
have
to
believe
it,
that
somehow
it
is
effective
for
agricultural
marketing
orders,
but
having
the
government
in
cooperation
with
the
industry,
the
corporate
state,
it
is
called,
in
italy,
as
an
efficient
mechanism
for
producing
economic
prosperity?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
for
agriculture.
i
mean,
congress
hasn't
done
it
for
everything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
express
the
belief
that
elsewhere
that
isn't
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
market
disorder
is
okay.
indeed,
it's
what
drives
the
market.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
will
invoke
the
government's
aid
anywhere.
where
have
they
not
felt
the
need
to
invoke
the
government's
aid?
justice
antonin
scalia
they'll
take
the
government's
aid
wherever
they
can
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jenkins,
this
relates
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
big
jim,
and--
--red
jim.
red
jim,
i'm
sorry.
[laughter]
i
don't
know
how
i
could
have
made
that
mistake.
and
ties
it
in
to
the
government's
assertion
that
abood
governs
here.
let
me
read
you
what
i
wrote
in
an
opinion
joined
by
justices
o'connor,
souter,
and
kennedy
in
a
case
called
lehnert
v.
ferris
faculty
association:
what
is
distinctive,
the
opinion
said,
about
the
free
riders
who
are
nonunion
members
of
the
union's
own
bargaining
unit,
is
that
in
some
respects
they
are
free
riders
whom
the
law
requires
the
union
to
go
out
of
its
way
to
benefit
even
at
the
expense
of
its
other
interests.
in
the
labor
union
context,
the
union
has
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
every
one
of
the
employees,
whether
they're
union
members
or
not,
and
sometimes
has
to
sacrifice
its
own
interest
to
those
obligations.
that
is
not
the
case
as
i
understand
this
program.
it
can
be
the
case
that
advertising
will
benefit
a
mere
majority
of
the
handlers
and
severely
impair
the
interests
of
a
minority
of
members.
you
don't
assert
that
there
is
a
fiduciary
obligation
here
on
the
part
of
the
organization,
as
there
is
with
unions,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
the
bar
is
a
special
situation,
and
have
always
felt
that,
but
as
far
as
unions
go,
you
have
the
distinctive
fiduciary
obligation.
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
take
abood
and
apply
it
to
this
situation,
where
a
majority
can
harm
a
minority's
interests.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
them
here
say
they're
being
harmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
them
here
say
they're
being
harmed,
that
the
mere
advertising
of,
generically,
peaches
harms
them
because
they
are
trying
to
convince
the
public
that
all
peaches
are
not
fungible,
that
some
kind
of
peaches
are
really
good
peaches,
and
their
interests
are
harmed
by
any
generic
peach
advertising.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
beer
is
less
important
than
peaches?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
question
is
whether
congress
made
the
findings,
not
whether
the
district
court
did.
did
congress
make
the
findings?
justice
antonin
scalia
citing
the
findings,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--statements
by...
not
the
whole
congress,
but
by
some
individual
members
of
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
committee
reports?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
was
no
congressional
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
disorderly
markets
are
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
congress
leave
those
findings
to
be
made
by
the
secretary?
congress
does
that
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
establishes
a
basic
framework
for
a
program
and
says
if
an
executive
officer
finds
a
certain
situation
to
exist,
he
can
take
certain
actions.
they
do
that
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure
you
do.
i
just
asked
you
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
government
speech,
which
would
pose
a
different
issue,
so
we
can
get
rid
of
a
whole
lot
of
those
regulatory
programs
that
justice
breyer
was
referring
to,
and
only
limit
ourselves
to
those
in
which
a
privately
run
organization
spends
money
that
is
assessed
against
competitors.
namely,
all
of
the
programs.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
believe
that
all
california
peaches
are
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
the
message
that
this
advertising
conveys
to
the
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they're
conveying
precisely
the
message
that
you
want
to
counter.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
associational
objection,
as
i
take
it,
is
not
an
objection
to
simply
being
regulated
with
everybody
else,
associated
on
that
basis,
but
rather
the
objection
of
being
presented
to
the
public
as
in
league
with
everybody
else:
all
us
california
peach-growers
are
the
same.
california
peaches
are
california
peaches,
and
california
peach-growers
are
california
peach-growers.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
like
some
of
these
other
peach-growers,
do
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
not
an
apa
problem.
i
thought
your
point
was
that
the
first
amendment
requires
that
you
be
careful
and
do
it
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
is
not
required
in
some
other
areas.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
must
demonstrate
the
compelling
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
keep
drifting
away
from
the
first
amendment,
and
it
does
get
to
sound
like
an
administrative
procedure
act
problem,
but
that
is
not
your
point.
your
point
is
that
these
i's
have
to
be
dotted
and
the
t's
have
to
be
crossed
because
the
first
amendment
is
at
stake.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
--to
what
effect?
to
the
effect
that
the
advertising
goes
primarily
or
overwhelmingly
to
support
the
proposition
that
all
california
peaches
are
desirable?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
and--
--mr....
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
object
to
that.
you'd
be
here
even
if
they
weren't
pushing
the
red
jim
or
whatever
this
nectarine
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
but
isn't
there
another
reason--
justice
antonin
scalia
--green
plums?
i
would
never
give
my
wife
a
green
plum.
[laughter]
mr.
campagne--
--i've
never
even
seen
a
green
plum.
i
thought
plums--
plums
aren't
regulated
any
more,
so
why
are
we
talking
about
those?
justice
antonin
scalia
greengage.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
anything
in
the
law
prevent
bias?
does
anything
in
the
law...
let's
assume
that
51
percent
of
the
california
growers
grow
red
peaches,
or
red
nectarines,
or
whatever
color
red
things
we
were
talking
about.
anything
in
the
law
would
prevent
this
money
from
being
spent
with
advertisements
showing
only
the
red
fruit?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
provision
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
