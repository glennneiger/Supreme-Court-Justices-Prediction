justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
a
question
at
an
early
stage,
mr.
jenkins?
i
think
you
take
the
position
here
that
you
didn't...
that
the
government
didn't
argue
that
the
abood
line
or
the
union
line
cases
wasn't
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit
because
of
the
cal-almond
decision
in
that
court,
but
the
administrative
law
judge
suggests
that
the
government
at
least
in
that
forum
said
that
the
abood
line
didn't
apply,
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
government
has
waived
that,
if
we
can't
just
assume
that
the
central
hudson
test
applies--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
light
of
the
posture
taken
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
does
appear
that
the
government
below
chose
not
to
urge
the
abood
line,
took
that
tactic,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
should
address
that
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
let
me
ask
you
about
that.
one
of
respondents'
complaints
is
that
the
1989
advertising
guide
promoted
a
proprietary
variety
of
nectarine,
the
red
jim,
which
is
grown
exclusively
by
one
of
the
growers,
and
a
grower
who
does
not
want
to
lease
or
sell
a
royalty
to
that,
so
red
jim
is
grown
only
by
one
grower.
now,
do
you
defend
that
practice
under
the...
under
any
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
amazing,
that
the
government
could
take
money
from
everybody
in
the
industry,
every
grower
of
peaches
and
nectarines,
and
advertise
one
grower's
exclusive
use
to
a
patented
fruit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
defend
the
right
of
the
government
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
answer
that
isolated
question...
under
any
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say,
if
it
happens
once
in
a
while
it's
okay.
we
can
overlook
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
say
if
there
are
violations,
they're
de
minimis,
and
so
we
can
ignore
them.
is
that
in
a
nutshell
what
you
say
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
clarify
one
more
thing
for
me?
assessments
under
this
program
run
against
the
handlers,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
the
growers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
the
handlers
pass
it
on
to
the
growers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
who
has
to
vote
to
terminate
the
program,
the
growers
or
the
handlers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
well
as
the
growers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
set
it
in
place
in
the
first
place,
handlers
and
growers
vote.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
to
terminate
it
only
growers
vote.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
any
of
the
growers
asked
for
a
vote
on
peaches
and
nectarines
in
california?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
is
that?
can
we
find
it
in
something
that
we
have
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
nothing
in
words
to
that
effect
in
the
ads,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
be
here
at
all
if
the
advertising
were
in
fact
generic
advertising
for
california
fruit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
is
there
some
problem
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
it
is
you
say
causes
or
results
in
a
first
amendment
violation
here.
it
is
not
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
represent
handlers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
know
you
were
here
on
some
apa
claim.
i
thought
what
we
had
before
us
was
a
first
amendment
claim,
and
i
haven't
heard
a
response
yet
as
to
what
specific
problem
you
have
that
triggers
the
first
amendment.
are
you
relying
on
the
fact
that
there
are
assessments
made,
and
you
have
less
money
to
advertise
on
your
own?
is
that
part
of
your
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
odd,
because
i
thought
that
there
isn't
much
difference
between
an
assessment
or
any
other
fee
or
tax
that
government
might
take,
which
necessarily,
of
course,
limits
your
funds
for
advertising.
you
have
less
money.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
cite
a
case
from
this
court
to
support
you
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
pg&e.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
a
citation
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
say
that
your
growers
do
not...
that
your
clients
do
not
grow
peaches
or
nectarines?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
may
well
have
been
an
error,
as
the
government
conceded
in
its
argument,
but
you
don't
overturn
the
whole
program,
i
suppose.
you
would
overturn
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
there
other
examples
where
in
these
advertisements
a
single
proprietary
item
that
no
one
else
could
acquire
was
advertised
by
name,
and
if
so,
what,
and
where?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
was
specifically
referred
to
in
the
ad?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
the
only
ads--
--greengage.
excuse
me.
i
thought
the
only
ad
programs
once
plums
were
out
of
it
were
for
peaches
and
nectarines.
