mr.
jenkins,
before
you
do
that
may
i
ask
you,
i
think
a
question
that
is
of
a
similar
basic
kind?
you
latch
onto
the
abood
and
keller
cases.
what
is
the
government
interest
here
that
compares
to
the
labor
peace
or
the
regulation
of
the
bar?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
why
is
it
so
important
that
we
have
these
orders?
what
purpose
that
compares
with
collective
bargaining
underlies
all
of
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
could
understand
that
if
this
was
across
the
board,
if
you
said
there
this
compelling
need,
and
so
we
do
it
for
all
agricultural
commodities,
but
it
seems
to
be
rather
haphazard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jenkins,
on
that
point,
i
understand
the
portion
of
these
marketing
orders
that
deals
with
inspection
quality
controls,
and
nobody
is
contesting
that
everybody
can
be
required
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
inspecting
and
assuring
health
and
safety
standards.
but
the...
whatever
importance
that
interest
has,
does
that
spill
over
to,
that
advertising
is
an
important
interest?
aren't
these
quite
discrete,
so
one
could
say
yes,
the
government's
got
a
very
important
interest
to
making
sure
that
health
requirements
are
met,
but
the
advertising,
the
promotional
interest
doesn't
have
the
same
strength,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
also
help,
but
does
it
have
the
same
importance
as
maturity
standards
and
the
inspection
controls?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jenkins--
--so
you're
saying...
i'm
sorry.
to
take
a
specific
case,
in
this
record
there's
nothing
like
there
was
in
the
case
before
the
third
circuit,
the
meat
case,
where
the
court
said,
well,
we
can
understand...
the
government
has
made
a
case
that
this
industry
is
in
disastrous
shape,
but
there's
nothing
of
that
kind
here,
that
the
peach
and
nectarine
industry
is
about
to
fall
apart,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
wrong
in
having
the
impression
that
congress
made
a
determination
with
respect
to
the
state
of
the
meat
market
and
said
we
have
to
respond
to
that
terrible
situation,
and
there
were
no
such
findings
by
the
legislature
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
programs,
but
is
there
anything...
are
you
telling
me
that
the
record
from
congress
is
comparable,
that
there
was
no
more
that
congress
said
about
the
meat
industry
than
it
said
about
the
fruit
industry?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
saying
that
that's
the
bottom
line
that
they
must
show?
it's
a
question
i
asked
mr.
jenkins
about
and
he
said
no,
that
frame
is
just
like
this
case,
but
i
couldn't
grasp
from
your
brief
whether
you
were
saying
this...
none
of
this
forced
advertising
can
be
justified
unless
there's
some
compelling
need
shown
in
the
particular
industry.
that
was
one
argument
that
you
made.
and
then
you
sort
of
had
another
argument
that
said,
well,
they
don't
give
us
credit
for
our
own
advertising,
and
they're
advertising
some
varieties
that
belong
to
particular
members
of
the
committee.
so
which
is
it?
are
you
saying
none
of
this
is
any
good,
or
some
of
it
may
be
good
but
some
isn't?
