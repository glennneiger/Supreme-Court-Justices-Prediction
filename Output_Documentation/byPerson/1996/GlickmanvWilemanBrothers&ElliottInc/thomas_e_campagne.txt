mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
there's
one
thing
everybody's
missing,
and
that
is,
what
is
the
problem?
what
is
the
problem
with
peaches,
plums,
and
nectarines
in
california
that's
any
different
than
the
other
32
states
that
grow
these
commodities?
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
well,
justice
scalia,
the
solicitor,
in
answering
your
question
in
that
regard,
i
believe
misspoke.
he
indicated
that
there
was
a
finding
that
there
was
disorderly
markets--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--and
he
cites
the
1954
act,
which
doesn't
deal
with
that
subject
whatsoever.
the
way
the
promulgation
records
show
here...
because
we
have
an
unusual
situation
that
justice
o'connor
spoke
about
in
the
community
nutrition
case,
where
we
file
a
15(a)
petition.
we
sue
before
an
alj
employed
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
she
gave
the
government
every
opportunity
possible...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
stipulated
that
exhibit
297,
and
they
made
that
stipulation
at
stipulation
number
57...
i'm
sorry,
59,
that
that
was
the
exclusive
rulemaking
record.
when
the
district
court
relied
on--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
very
well,
your
honor.
in
that
stipulation
the
administrative
law
judge
said,
i've
got
a
problem.
i
don't
understand
what
some
of
you
are
expressing
in
your
questions.
i
want
to
give
you
every
opportunity
to
show
me
that
there's
disorderly
marketing
going
on
in
california
but
not
in
the
other
32
states,
and
the
stipulation
that
was
entered
into
is
that
the
usda
relies
on
exhibit
297.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes.
it's
page
134a
of
our
appendix
to
our
opposition
to
the
petition,
your
honor.
in
there,
they
actually
stipulate
that
the
government
relies
solely
and
exclusively
on
exhibit
297,
and
i'm
paraphrasing,
as
being
the
entire
rulemaking
record
regarding
the
implementation
of
the
advertising
program.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
it
says,
as
being
the
entire
rulemaking
record--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--on
the
third
line,
your
honor,
regarding
the
implementation
of
the
advertising
record
with
respect
to
peaches,
plums,
and
nectarines
which
occurred
approximately
6
years
after
the
act
was
amended.
the
next--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
it
would
make
a
huge
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
they
would
have
an
easier
time
with
central
hudson.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
no,
your
honor.
despite
what
the
wall
street
journal
said
last
week,
we're
not
saying
that
the
beef
program
has
to
be
thrown
out
or
the
milk
program
has
to
be--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--but
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
don't
need
to
address
that
issue,
although--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
of
course
congress
can
delegate
its
legislative
authority,
despite
carter
v.
cole,
because
of
the
subsequent
cases,
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
but
he
didn't
do
that
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
1954
act
that
the
solicitor
was
referring
to
was
the
post
korea
act.
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
advertising.
the
advertising
act,
that's
608(c)(6)(i),
was
a...
came
into
existence
in
1965.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes,
your
honor.
we're
assessed
on
average
19
cents
a
carton.
nine
cents
goes
for
quality
control
and
inspection.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
fifty-three
percent...
that
is,
10
percent...
goes
to
generic
advertising.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
your
honor,
we
would
have
no
objection
whatsoever
if
the
secretary
of
agriculture
was
taking
money
out
of
the
general
treasury
and--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--the
first
amendment
issue,
your
honor,
is
two-pronged.
first
of
all,
they're
forcing
us
to
associate
with
our
competitors,
and
it's
not
like
the
milk
board,
where
milk
is
white
and
wet,
and
so
the
milk
board
doesn't
have
much
opportunity
to
prefer
one
product
over
another.
when
you
buy
milk,
you
don't
know
if
it's
a
jersey
or
a
guernsey
milk
you're
drinking,
whereas
in
our
commodity,
we
have
over
100
varieties
of
plums.
my
clients
happen
to
grow
some
green
plums.
if
i
tell
you
today--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--no.
in
their
footnote,
your
honor,
they
admit
this
is
not
government
speech,
although
one
of
their--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--but
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
here
we
have
absolutely
no
studies
whatsoever.
when
the
act
was
amended
in
1965
it
was
done
by
one
letter,
one
letter
from
the
secretary
to
congress
that
said,
i
would
like
to
implement
advertising
because--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--if
they
could
meet
the
central
hudson
test,
which
was
the
test
they
stipulated
to
before
the
ninth
circuit
in
cal-almond--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
some
of
our
clients
testified
they
don't
sponsor
lying.
they
believe--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--lying.
misleading
the
public.
the
generic
advertising
program
is
that
a
california
peach
is
better
than
a
georgia
peach
or
a
south
carolina
peach,
which
together
add
up
to
the
same
amount
of
volume
we
have.
we
say
that's
not
true.
there's
over
100
varieties,
and
if
you
grow
that
variety
in
south
carolina
it's
going
to
taste
the
same
as
that
variety
tastes
in
california.
it's
a
lie.
another
one
of
our
clients
testified
that
he
really
resents
the
sexual
subliminal
messages
of
the
advertising
board.
he
happens
to
be
on
a
hospital
board
that
deals
with
abuse
of
children.
they--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--and
the
radio
that
says
so
juicy,
so
sweet,
a
radio
advertisement
right
afterwards
that
says
eating
a
peach
reminds
you
of
your
first
kiss
in
the
back
seat
of
your
car.
he
has
an
ideological
problem
with
that,
but
more
importantly,
they're
sending
a
subliminal
message
that
red
is
better.
now,
if
i
ask
each
one
of
you
to
buy
some--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--no,
your
honor.
it's
the
depiction,
the
subliminal
message
that
red
is
better,
and
some
of
these
varieties,
not
only
the
red
jim
that
you
mentioned--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--well,
first
of
all
they'd
have
to
define
to
me,
your
honor,
in
some--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--what
the
problem...
that's
the
point,
exactly.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
i
don't
know--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--they
take
almost
a
million
dollars
a
year,
give
it
to
my
competitors
to
advertise
15
varieties
of
fruit
we
don't
grow,
and
force
us
to
associate
with
our
competitors
in
a
manner--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--i
represent
handlers/shippers,
but
there's
a
big
distinction,
your
honor.
my
handlers
are
growers
who
handle
their
own
fruit.
the
handlers
that
run
the
committee
are
growers
who...
are
handlers
who
primarily
ship
fruit
grown
by
other
people.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
because
what--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--in
1959,
when
they
promulgated
marketing
orders
for
quality
control
there
was
no
problem.
we
had
no
objection
to
that.
but
when
they
moved
in
1971
for
a
legislative
amendment
and
in
1975
and
1976
actually
adopted
it,
with
no
rulemaking
record
of
congress
at
all,
and
then
made
it
discretionary
so
that
annually
the
secretary
of
agriculture
annually
is
supposed
to
be
deciding
whether
to
advertise,
how
much
money
to
advertise,
is
there
a
problem
in
california
that's
different
in
other
states...
he
didn't
do
any
of
that.
actually,
no
notice
and
comment
through
1986
harvest,
a
few
months
before
my
trial
started.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
that's
absolutely
what
i
was
trying
to
express,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes,
but,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--yes,
pg&e,
and
that
is
that
you're
taking
our
money--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes,
your
honor.
pg&e
v.
puc
of
california,
cited
in
our
merits
brief.
that's
the
case,
your
honor,
where
you
struck
a
rule
that
required
pg&e
to
promulgate
the
messages
in
their
own
envelopes
to
others,
and
the
reason
this
court
struck
it
is
that
it
stated
it
would
require
pg&e
to
respond
when
they
might
not
otherwise
want
to
speak,
and
that's
exactly
what
goes
on
here.
we
give
almost
a
million
dollars
a
year,
of
which
53
percent
is
devoted
to
generic
collective
advertising,
to
our
competitors
who
grow
fruit
we
don't
grow,
primarily,
and
then
when
we
do
have
a
little
bit
of
money
left
over
and
try
to
advertise
our
own
brands,
we
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
it
trying
to
change
the
minds
of
the
consumer--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--our
clients
grow
peaches,
plums,
and
nectarines,
but
there's
over
100
varieties
of
each
peach,
plum,
and
nectarine,
unlike
beef
and
unlike
milk,
where--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
they're
conveying...
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
we
want
you
to
buy
our
yellow
nectarines
and
not
their
red
nectarines.
they
taste
better.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
it
would
be...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
be
much--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--if
they
could
establish
that
california
had
a
problem
which
the
government
had
an
interest
in
solving,
but
there
is
no
record
whatsoever--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
answer
would
be
yes
if
there
was
only
one
variety
of
peaches
and
it
was
grown
in
33
states,
and
for
some
reason
california's
economic
environment
was
in
imminent
danger
of
collapse,
and
no
other
states--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--well,
in
frame
they
stipulated--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--that
the
meat
industry
was
in
imminent
danger
of
collapse
and
they
assessed--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--we're
saying
both,
your
honor.
we're
saying
first,
if
you
want
to
force
me
to
associate
with
my
competitors
when
we're
head-on
competing,
that
i
want
you
to
buy
my
yellow
nectarines
and
not
your
red
nectarines,
and
you're
giving
my
money
to
the
person
who
grows
those
red
nectarines,
you've
got
to
show
a
problem
that
requires
a
governmental
compelling
interest
to
solve
under
association
rights.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
under
that
hypothetical
of
course,
your
honor,
if
there
was
a
compelling
governmental
interest
to
solve
some
serious
problem--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--and
we
only
grew
one
variety
in
all
the
states,
the
answer
would
be
that
3
percent
would
be
bad.
however,
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor.
a
peach
is
not
a
peach.
a
plum
is
not
a
plum.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
they
haven't
made
any
such
findings,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
of
this
trial
where
alj
baker
said
bring
in
all
the
rulemaking
record
and
produce
all
your
witnesses,
prove
that
there's
over
100
varieties
of
peach,
and
they're
completely
different,
and
i
can
prove
it
to
you--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--i'm
sorry,
i
couldn't
hear
the
end
of--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--this
particular
program
on
this
particular
19
days
of
trial
record,
it
was
tainted
from
the
very
beginning.
they
went
to
congress
on
one
letter,
and
all
they
said
is,
the
majority
of
the
growers
want
it.
that's
all.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
just
like
turner.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
exactly.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
for
over
20
years
they
didn't
produce
any
studies
or
any
reports
showing
that
california--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
but
you're
forgetting
a
very
key
important
point,
your
honor.
at
least
we're
playing
on
a
level
playing
field
when
the
agency
says
you
can't
sell
a
nectarine,
whether
it's
a
red
jim
nectarine
or
a
tom
gran
yellow
nectarine,
if
it
has
a
worm
in
it.
we're
not
going
to
advertise
to
people
and
change
our
message
that
we
want
you
to
eat
worms.
but
when
50
percent
of
this
advertising
dollar
goes
to
spending,
as
their
own
testimony
indicates,
towards
varieties
that
are
controlled
by
40
to
60
percent
of...
single
varieties
controlled
by
40
to
60
percent
of
the
handlers
that
aren't
us,
we're
not
playing
on
a
level
playing
field.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes,
your
honor.
i
can
give
you
a
good
example.
when
mr.
gerawan
testified
that
in
1987
they
took
675,000
from
him
and
gave
it
to
his
competitors
of
a
committee
of
nectarine
growers
that
was
run
by
his
competitor,
mr.
jimmy
ito,
whose
proprietary
variety
is
the
red
jim
nectarine
that
mr.
gerawan
can
neither
grow
nor
buy,
nor
handle,
because
all
the
fruit
has
to
be
handled
by
mr.
ito,
that
he...
he
respects
mr.
ito,
but
he
just
doesn't
want
his
money
to
go
to
him,
because
they
have
a
marketing
window
and
they're
producing
the
same...
he
produces...
and
competes
with--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--but
it's
inherent
to
the
entire
system,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
the
may
belle
nectarine,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
the
may
belle
nectarine.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
i
believe
in
the
very
same
exhibit.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
it's
in
that
same
section.
i
can't
remember
the
exact--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--yes.
mr.
field,
the
chief
employee
of
the
committee,
testified
that
they
tried
to
advertise
the
top
15
producing
varieties
and
to
leave
the
other
100
minor
varieties
behind,
but
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--they're
spending
all
of
their
tv
and
radio
advertising
money
on
eat
california
peaches
because
they're
all
the
same
before
july
4,
80
percent
of
the
money.
they're
reserving
20
percent
of
it
to--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--there's
a
finding
to
that
effect
in
judge
baker's
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
are
the
same.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
and
she
further--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--absolutely,
because
that's
not
truthful.
i
want
to
tell--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--that
you
ought
to
buy
green
plums
and
give
them
to
your
wife,
and
you're
thinking
to
yourself
right
now
you
don't
want
to
give
your
wife
diarrhea,
but
green
plums--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--because,
your
honor,
we
have
almost
$6
million
in
trust--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--and
the
ninth
circuit
ordered
that
there
would
be
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
those
moneys
that
we
related
to
plums
from
1987
through
1991,
so
plums
are
still
relevant.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
and
we
grow
green
plums.
we
just--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
it's
not
moot
because
the
regulation
never
changed
that
required
the
secretary
to
annually
decide
whether
or
not
to
advertise,
if
so,
where,
how
much
money,
and
mr.
chief
justice
raised
a
very
interesting
question
to
the
solicitor,
and
that
is,
doesn't
this
all
kind
of
follow
the
law
of
supply
and
demand,
but
one
thing
we
notice
here
is
that
as
the
crop
goes
down,
the
assessments
change,
versus
go
up.
in
other
words,
the
promulgation
record
we
have
in
existence
here
is
not
tied
to
solving
any
problem.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
there's
no
problem--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--and
because
there's
no
problem--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
--there's
no
governmental
interest
in
solving
a
problem
that
doesn't
exist.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
because
in
that
sense,
when
they
pass
a
quality
control
rule
that
says
that
all
growers
of
all
100
different
varieties,
green
and
red,
can't
sell
anything
that's
got
a
worm
in
it,
that
doesn't
impinge
on
my
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
no.
that's
just
pure
regulation.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
exactly.
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
we're
not
here,
your
honor,
trying
to
vitiate
the
entire
marketing
order.
we
don't...
we
accept
the
9
cents
that
goes
to
the
quality
control.
we're
only
speaking
to
the
10
cents
per
carton
that
goes
to
the
forced
association
with
our
competitors
who
grow
different
varieties
and,
basically,
in
some
varieties
take
over
$200
an
acre,
which
is
more
than
our
profit
margin
in
some
varieties,
and
force
us
in
the
limited
amount
of
time
we
have--
mr.
thomas
e.
campagne
