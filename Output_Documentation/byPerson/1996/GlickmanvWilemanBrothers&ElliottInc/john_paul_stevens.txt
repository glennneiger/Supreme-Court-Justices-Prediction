mr.
campagne,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
basically
have
a
constitutional
question
here,
and
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
details
floating
around.
would
it
make
any
difference,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
if
congress
had
made
a
finding
that
this
particular
market
had
particular
problems
that
justified
this
kind
of
group
advertising
program?
would
you
still
have
the
same
constitutional
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
not
saying
this
sort
of
program
is
always
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
they
did
a
lousy
job
here,
but
if
they'd
done
a
good
job,
it
would
be
constitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
we're
not
bound
by
that.
why
a
central
hudson
test,
where
in
fact
in
central
hudson
and
the
other
speech
cases
that
seem
relevant
there
was
a
problem
with
a
person
having
attributed
to
him
a
view
that
he
really
didn't
hold,
and
moreover
an
important
view,
and
a
political
view,
and
a
view
of
conscience.
is
there
anything
like
a
political
view,
a
view
of
conscience,
an
important,
critical
view
that
the
public
would
think
that
your
client
held
because
of
these
messages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
campagne--
--may
i
ask
you,
if
this
were
a
homogenous
product,
you
then
would
not
have
a
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
advertising
was
limited
to
those
features
of
the
california
peaches
that
were,
in
fact,
common
to
all
california
peaches,
you
would
not
have
a
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
they
could
do
that.
assume
they
could
establish
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
is
convinced
that
we
ought
to
sell
more
california
peaches,
and
that
therefore
they
ought
to
have
a
program
that
advertises
the
features
of
california
peaches
that
all
california
peaches
share.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
collapse,
does
it?
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
mean,
they've
got
all
sorts
of
marketing
orders
where
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
interrupt
again,
mr.
campagne?
supposing
that
you
agree
that
if
the
advertising
were
restricted
to
common
features
of
california
peaches,
and
there
was
an
adequate
justification...
the
industry
is
having
all
sorts
of
troubles.
people
are
buying
bananas
instead
of
peaches...
and
the
advertising
was
restricted,
i
think
you'd
say
that
would
be
okay,
but
you're
complaining
because
they
advertise
features
of
the
peaches
that
are
unique
to
some
varieties
and
not
shared
by
all
the
others.
now,
supposing
97
percent
of
the
advertising
concentrates
on
common
features,
and
3
percent
is
bad
under
your
analysis.
is
the
whole
program
bad,
or
just
the
3
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
if
the
secretary
of
agriculture
made
a
lot
of
findings
saying
a
peach
is
a
peach,
to
add--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
reference
to
the
marketing--
--but
the
question,
the
basic
question
i
have
is
whether
you're
really
attacking
a
program
as
a
program,
or
maladministration
of
the
program.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
whether
the
program
is
just
sort
of
per
se
bad,
or
has
it
just
been
poorly
administered.
you
make
a
very
persuasive
case
that
they've
made
some
bad
decisions
along
the
way,
but
does
that
taint
the
entire
program?
that's
the
basic
question
i
see.
