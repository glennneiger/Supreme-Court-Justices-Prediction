mr.
jenkins,
assuming
that
we
apply
one
or
the
other
test
in
a
way
that
requires
us
to
determine
the
value
of
the
government's
interest,
do
you
claim
that
the
value
of
the
government's
interest
depends
on
a
government
concern
over
and
above
that
of
the
growers
whose
products
they
are
advertising,
or,
on
the
other
hand,
do
you
claim
that
the
government's
interest
is
essentially
derivative,
that
it's
important
simply
because
the
growers
themselves
want
to
do
this,
and
that
desire,
that
vote
in
fact
on
their
part
establishes
its
importance?
which
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
growers,
as
i
understand
it,
do
not
vote
in
any
narrow
or
specific
sense
as
to
whether
the
interest
is
threatened.
they
simply
vote
as
to
whether
they
want
the
advertising
program
or
not,
isn't
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
how
you
would
explain
the...
what
struck
me,
at
least,
as
the
peculiarity
in
this
case
that
apparently
there
are,
i
guess,
peach-growers,
for
example,
in
some
30
states,
but
the
only
ones
who
seem
to
have
expressed
a
need
for
this
advertising
scheme
are
california
peach-growers.
is
the
explanation
for
that
that
there
simply
has
not
been
a
demonstrated
instability
in
markets
elsewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
record
support
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
can
it
be
narrow
tailoring
when
the...
when
in
effect
the
tailoring
is
done
by
a
nongovernmental
entity?
i
mean,
the
tailoring
to
which
you
are
referring,
market-specific,
region-specific,
is
simply
done
by
a
vote
of
the
people
who
are
growing
the
peaches.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
argument
is
on
that,
as
i
understand
it,
that
we
have
generally
accepted
the
proposition
that
advertising
induces
people
to
buy
what
is
advertised.
i
mean,
do
you...
there's
kind
of
an
assumption
as
a
matter
of
law
that
advertising
works
to
some
degree,
and
i
will
grant
you
that,
but
is
that
enough
in
a
case
like
this,
because
it
seems
to
me,
number
one,
that
advertise...
the
assumption
that
advertising
works
doesn't
tell
us
very
much
about
whether
the
advertising
is
creating
or
advancing
an
orderly
market
as
opposed
to
a
less
orderly
one,
and
it
doesn't
tell
us
very
much
about
what
the
difference
is
between
the
effect
of
advertising
either
on
consumption
or
orderly
markets
in
california
and
the
failure
of
advertising
with
respect
to
markets
everywhere
else.
i
guess
to
put
the...
my
question
in
a
nutshell,
are
the
peach
growers
in
the
other,
whatever
it
is,
29
states
making
less
of
a
profit
in
a
chaotic
market
as
opposed
to
the
california
growers
who,
as
a
result
of
this
advertising
program,
are
making
measurably
more
money
in
an
orderly
market?
do...
does
the
record
indicate
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
makes
consumers
buy
them,
is
what
you
mean.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
it
regulates
only
in
the
sense
that
it...
we
will
assume
that
it
creates
some
demand
that
would
not
have
been
there
otherwise.
but
when
we're
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
there
are
in
fact
contrasting
markets,
and
we
want
to
know,
even
under
a
comparatively
relaxed
standard,
what
the
causal
connection
is
between
the
advertising
and
orderly
markets,
it
seems
to
me
sensible
to
look
at
the
markets
where
the
advertising
isn't
going
on
to
see
if
they
are
depressed
or
disorderly,
and
i
take
it
we
cannot
do
that
in
this
case,
because
the
record
just
doesn't
tell
us
anything
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
fair
to
say...
and
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
you
off.
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
campagne,
that
raises
something
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
you
on.
as
i
understand
it,
even
if
the
advertising
were
truthful,
and
even
if
the
advertising
were
truly
generic,
you
would
still
claim
that
there
was
a
first
amendment
violation,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
there
is
no
justification
in
the
first
place.
there
is
no
necessity.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me
ask
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
ask
you
a
final
question.
if
that
is
so,
why
do
you
concede
that
you
have
no
first
amendment
objection
to
the...
in
effect,
to
the
forced
association
with
the
growers
for
nonspeech
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
that
really
is
not
an
association
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
really
isn't
an
association
component
here
to
the
regulatory...
to
the
regulatory
scheme,
which
is
exclusive
of
the
speech
problem
that
you
raise.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
position?
