justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
says...
i
have
what
he
says,
what
he
says
in
the
brief
is,
he
says,
you
may
still
sentence
him
to
life
in
prison.
what
does
this
mean?
no
sentence
ever
meted
out
to
this
man
has
stopped
him.
nothing
has
stopped
him,
and
nothing
ever
will
except
the
punishment
that
i
now
ask
you
to
impose,
so
i
suppose
that
the
jury
might
think
that
if
we
sentence
him
to
life
in
prison,
he
will
get
out
and
continue
to
commit
crimes,
and
it
is
in
that
context
that
the
instruction
that
life
means
life
was
asked
for.
well,
wasn't--
--now,
if
there's
agreement
about...
is
that
right?
wasn't
this
defendant
someone
who
had
committed
a
murder--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
that
was
all
improper.
what
i'm
interested
in
is
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
they
asked
for
an
instruction
in
a
context
where
because
of
what
the
prosecutor
said,
and
because
of
the
law,
the
jury
might
think
that
he
will
in
fact
be
released
for...
from
prison
if
the
sentence
is
life.
i
would
have
thought
the
jury
would
have
thought
that
he'd
kill
somebody
in
prison.
well,
i
don't--
--that
seems
to
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
what
the
jury
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
its
simplest
level,
i
was
taking
their
argument,
or
a
possible
argument
to
be
the
following.
at
its
simplest
level
you
have
a
rule
growing
out
of
preceding
cases
that
where
the
jury
is
under
an
important
potential,
false
apprehension
about
the
difference
between
life
and
death,
that
under
those
circumstances
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
clarify
matters.
and
on
that
very
simple,
basic
way
of
looking
at
it,
you
would
see
gardner,
skipper,
and
simmons,
each
is
involving
a
fairly
simple
misapprehension
that
was
important
and
later
clarified,
while
ramos,
you
would
see
as
involving
a
possible
misapprehension,
but
one
that
was
very
unlikely
to
affect
the
jury.
not
impossible,
but
unlikely.
now,
under...
that's
the
theory,
or
a
theory
i
think
that
would
say,
simmons
is
simply
an
application
of
a
preceding
existing
general
principle,
and
ramos
is
the
same
thing,
though
the
facts
of
it
lead
to
the
opposite
conclusion,
so
i'd
appreciate
comments
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
actually
have
trouble
in,
but
i
don't
know
that
you
can
help,
is
everything's
new
in
a
sense,
and
everything
relates
to
everything--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--previously
in
a
sense,
so
how
is
the
line
drawn?
what
they're
saying
here
is,
it's
so
obvious
that
juries
think
that
life
doesn't
mean
life.
the
average
person
in
the
street
thinks
that,
life
doesn't
mean
life,
that
it
doesn't
take
much
before
they
think
in
the
jury
box,
life
doesn't
mean
life,
and
therefore
tell
them,
life
means
life,
otherwise
they'll
sentence
the
person
to
death
under
that
misapprehension.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
what
i
think
he's
saying
is
so
serious,
because
there's
such
a
basic
principle
in
the
law,
that
certainly
you're
not
going
to
sentence
people
to
death
when
the
jury's
under
a
serious
misapprehension
that
somebody
is
trying
to
cure.
and
all
the
details
of
all
these
cases,
which
you're
absolutely
right,
they're
all
over
the
place
in
terms
of
complexity,
that's
really
beside
the
point
when
you
see
that
very
basic
thing
that
they're
trying
to
illustrate.
