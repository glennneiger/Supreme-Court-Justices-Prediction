justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
didn't
mention
the
footnote
in
your...
in
the
habeas
petition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
was
a
151-page
habeas
petition
which
doesn't
mention
that
footnote.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
ramos,
and
you're
going
to
have
to
get
to
ramos
sooner
or
later,
we
in
effect
said
the
instruction
to
the
jury
about
the
governor's
power
of
commutation
of
a
death
sentence
was
not
a
required
instruction.
that's
i
think
implicit
in
the
holding.
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
ramos--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
not
explicit,
and
that
was
what
the
judges
had
before
them
as
of
the
time
this
conviction
became
final.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
it
did
present
was,
i
think,
a
puzzling
tactical
decision
that
counsel
has
to
make,
but
i
think
you
have
that
same
tactical
decision
in
every
jury
case.
you
have
some
cases
where
the
prison...
where
a
prison
inmate
is
killed,
and
you
don't
want
to
emphasize
to
the
jury
that
he's
going
to
be
in
prison
the
rest
of
his
life.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
point
is,
is
that
as
of
the
time
this
conviction
became
final
you
had
ramos,
which
made
it
very
clear
that
these
choices
are
ones
for
states
to
make.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
will
check
it.
but
in
ramos
and
in
simmons
so
far
as
the
state's
position
in
simmons
the
court
was
very
concerned
with
the
fact
that
these
aren't
simple
matters
of
historical
fact,
because
the
law
can
change.
if
the
defendant
is
subject
to
life
without
possibility
of
parole,
that
can
change,
and
the
prosecution
can
argue
that
in
rebuttal,
and
that's
why
simmons
was
new.
it
was
instructing
juries
about
laws,
and
laws
can
change.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
also
subject
to
judicial
notice
that
the
legislature
might
change
the
rules
on
parole.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
was
of
great
concern
to
the
court
in
simmons,
because
the
instructions
get
very
complex.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel
for
the
defense
says
now
he's
not
going
to
be
paroled,
then
on
rebuttal
the
prosecution
says
this
has
been
changed
many
times,
and
corrections
policy
is
subject
to
the
whim
of
the
legislature.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
may
not
have
been...
on
your
view
of
simmons
there
may
not
have
been
simmons
error,
but
there
was,
in
fact,
an
erroneous
implication
raised
about
the
state
of
virginia
law
at
the
time
the
argument
was
made--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
is...
you
concede
that,
don't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
all
events
that's
a
harmless
error
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
a
simmons
regime
they
would
have
been
mandatorily
entitled
to
this
instruction--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
the
question
is
to
simmons--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
fact,
pre-simmons,
wasn't
one
of
the
rationales
for
that
that
it's
a
distraction
to
the
jury
to
begin
to
speculate
about
what
might
or
might
not
happen
on
parole,
particularly
because
the
law
changes
constantly--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
they
wanted
the
jury
to
focus
precisely
on
what
the
sentence...
sentencing
options
before
them
were.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
are
not
synonymous
with
new
rule,
are
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
are
they
synonymous
with
new
rule?
