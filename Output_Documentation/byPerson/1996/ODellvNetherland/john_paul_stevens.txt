mr.
smith,
it
goes
to
both
the
two
theories
on
which
you
proceed.
are
you
just
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
state
had
to
establish
future
dangerousness,
or
are
you
also
relying
on
the
specific
arguments
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
this
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
skipper
rather
than
gardner
is
the
more
relevant
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--justice
stevens.
could
i
just
ask
you
to
comment,
because
i
accepted
this,
and
i
guess
i
should
not
have.
they
say
in
the
brief
that
in
cross-examination
of
o'dell
the
prosecutor
used
the
words
parole
and
release
17
times.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
he
represent
himself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
there's
also
a
reference
in
their
brief...
and
again,
i
haven't
checked
the
record
myself...
to
an
argument
by
the
prosecutor,
isn't
it
interesting,
he's
only
able
to
be
outside
of
the
prison
system
for
a
matter
of
months,
and
then
things
happen
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was
fair
to
infer...
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
this...
from
the
proceeding
as
a
whole
that
the
prosecutor
argued
in
substance
implicitly
that
he
is
especially
dangerous
because
he
might
be
out
of
prison.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
create
the
impression
that
the
only
way
to
keep
him
off
the
street
was
by
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that's
the
case,
if
the
jury
understood
its
equally
dangerous
in
prison
or
out,
i
kind
of
wonder
why
the
prosecutor
objected
to
the
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
all
of
this
testimony
should
have
been
excluded,
too,
where
they're
referring
to
parole--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
see,
in
simmons
itself
the
argument
of
future
dangerousness
was...
the
prosecutor
only
implicitly
argued
that
this
man
would
be
out
of
jail
because
they
said
it's
an
act
of
self-defense,
and
from
that
the
court
was
willing
to
infer
that
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
argument.
but
you
don't
think
that
kind
of
inference
is
permissible
from
this
prosecutor's
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
were,
would
you
agree,
then,
that
clearly
simmons
would
not
have
been
a
new
rule?
if
the
prosecutor
had
in
effect
misrepresented
to
the
jury
that
this
man
will
get
out
of
jail
unless
you
sentence
him
to
death,
that...
and
the
court
then
refused
to
give
the
instruction,
i
think
you
would
agree
that
that
would
have
been
impermissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
am
i
correct
in
reading
the
prosecutor's
argument,
the
prosecutor
did
not
refer
to
that
incident
at
all
in
his
closing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
what
he
then
followed
with
talking
about,
isn't
it
interesting
that
he's
only
able
to
be
outside
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
prison
system
for
a
matter
of
months
and
a
year-and-a-half
before
something
has
happened
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
think
that
argument
implied
to
the
jury
that
the
death
penalty
is
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
these
crimes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
theory
of
the
exception
is
that
the
error
was
so
serious
the
judgment
was
not
valid
when
it
was
made.
that's
the
whole
theory,
that
if
there's
a
sufficiently
serious
constitutional
error,
the
whole
thing
is
void.
that
was
the
old-fashioned
notion
in
habeas
corpus
years
ago,
and
that's
the
underlying
basis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i'm
mixing
up
the
two
exceptions,
but
when
the
error
is
sufficiently
serious
that...
the
whole
thing
is
void.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
mixing
up
the
exceptions.
