justice
david
h.
souter
when,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens,
you
said
you
base
your
argument
here
in
part
on
the
prosecutor's
representations,
i
take
it
your
point
there
is
that
they
were,
in
fact,
misrepresentations.
perhaps
not
malicious
lies,
but
they
in
fact
had
the
effect
of
misrepresenting
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
it's
a
rebuttal
of
a
misrepresentation
which
is
the
nub
of
your
claim
both
under
the
teague
exception
and
i
suppose
under
the
teague
new
rule
standard
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
could
be
so
read.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
sure...
i
don't...
or
i
think
you're
referring
to
counsel's
response
to
my
question.
i
didn't
take...
in
fact,
i
thought
he
was
very
diplomatic
in
not
suggesting
that
there
was
any
sort
of
ethical
impropriety,
but
what
was
left,
i
think
his
point
was,
was
a
misleading
impression.
it
was
in
effect
a
misrepresentation
of
possibilities,
and
i
think
i
said
in
my
question
i'm
not
suggesting
he
was
malicious,
and
counsel
was
very
careful
to
say
that
he
wasn't,
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
misrepresentation
i
think
that
is...
was
of
concern
to
me
and
was
of
concern
to
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
clear
that
the
impression
that
a
jury
would
take
from
the
argument
was
the
impression
that,
under
the
law
as
it
existed,
this
individual
could
be
paroled
and
placed
out
on
the
street
again
so
that
he
could
commit
the
kind
of
depredations
that
he
prosecutor
quite
accurately
was
referring
to
as
his
past
acts,
and
that
in
fact
was
not
so,
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
he
is
arguing
that
he
had
a
right
to
rebut
something.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
it
would
have
been
relevant
to
put
in
this
information
about
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
i
was
going
to
say...
my
question
was
going
to
be,
isn't
it
the
case
that
what
he
wants
to
rebut
was
an
implication
about
the
law
which
in
fact
is
not
correct,
i.e.,
the
implication
that
under
the
law
he
could
be
paroled
for
this
offense?
that's
what
he...
that's
the
implication.
that's
what
he
wants
to
rebut,
and
that
implication
is
wrong,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
do
we
do
about
a
situation
in
which
the
rule
is
new
in
the
sense
that
there's
no
other
decision
on
the
books,
but
in
fact
the
decision
is
in
response
to
a
problem
which
no
one
would
ever
have
conceived
would
have
arrived?
in
other
words,
in
effect
it's
such
an
egregious
case
that
it
was
never...
there
was
never
any
need
to
litigate
it
before,
so
in
once
sense
it's
a
new
rule
because
there
wasn't
any
prior
decision,
and
in
another
sense
it's
an
old
rule
because
no
one
in
his
right
mind
would
ever
have
thought
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
litigate
that
point.
would
that
kind
of
a
decision
satisfy
the
second
teague
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
quite
agree,
but
assuming
it
reaches
the
point
of
fundamental
importance
that
we're
talking
about,
would
it
satisfy
the
second
teague
exception
to
be
this
unusual
kind
of
new
rule,
which
is
new
only
in
the
sense
that
it's
so
fundamental
that
no
one
ever
had
to
litigate
it
before?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
that's
right.
that's
why
i
say,
we'll
assume
that
it
is
of
fundamental
importance.
start
with
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
there
are
two
ways
to
satisfy
the
something
more.
one
way
is
to
say,
this
represents
a
real
about-face
in
our
jurisprudence.
no
one
ever
thought
we
would
do
this,
but
it
now
seems
necessary.
a
second
way
would
be
to
say,
there's
nothing
new
about
this.
people
have
followed
this
kind
of
law
forever.
no
one
would
ever
reasonably
have
disputed
it.
what's
new
is
that
in
this
odd
case
it
had
to
be
litigated
and
go
on
the
books.
now,
assuming
that
we're
dealing
with
a
matter
of
fundamental
importance,
would
this
second
kind
of
case,
the
egregious
case
that
never
had
to
be
litigated
before
but
has
now
been
litigated
and
represents
what
most
people
would
have
supposed
the
law
always
had
been,
would
that
kind
of
a
case
satisfy
the
second
teague
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
say,
then,
that
it
was
no
rule,
no
new
rule
in
the
first
place,
that
even
though
there
was
no
prior
case
law
on
it,
it
simply
represented
what
had
been
the
accepted
law,
so
that
the
teague
issue
never
arises?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
say
it
fell
into
that
category.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
new
does
not...
your
argument
about
what
is
new
and
how
teague
should
be
understood
is
not
new
in
the
sense
that
looks
exclusively
to
prior
cases,
but
new
in
fact,
new
in
substance.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
i
accept
your
explanation--
