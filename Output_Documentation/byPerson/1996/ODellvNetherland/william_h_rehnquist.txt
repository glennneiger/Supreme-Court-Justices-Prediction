mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
will.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
skipper
was
not
really
a
due
process
case,
was
it?
it
was
an
eighth
amendment
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
text
of
the
opinion
pretty
well
limited
itself
to
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
relying
on
a
footnote
to
say
that
it's
a
due
process
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
strange
place
to
find
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
gardner
was
a
plurality
opinion,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whose,
in
addition
to
the
plurality?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
smith.
ms.
baldwin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
isn't
that--
--you
say
that
claim
was
never
made.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
baldwin.
mr.
smith,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
