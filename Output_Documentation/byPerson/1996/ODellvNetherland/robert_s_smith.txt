mr.
robert
s.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
here
is
whether
a
reasonable
jurist
in
1988
would
have
believed
the
decision
in
simmons
v.
south
carolina
compelled
by
the
court's
prior
decisions
in
gardner
and
skipper.
i
think
the
main
things
i
want
to
emphasize
are
first
how
closely
analogous
skipper
and
simmons
are,
how,
indeed,
hard
it
would
be
to
avoid
going
from
the
holding
of
skipper
to
the
holding
of
simmons
and,
on
the
other
hand
how
distant
the
issue
in
simmons
was
from
the
issue
in
california
v.
ramos,
which
is
the
case
principally
relied
on
by
the
commonwealth,
and
how
very
difficult
it
is
to
get
from
ramos
to
a
result
opposite
to
the
result
that
was
reached
in
simmons.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
the
split
on
this
court
as
to
whether
the
simmons
rule
was
required
by
the
constitution,
i
believe
the
court
was
7
to
2
on
that
issue,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding.
it
was
a...
there
was
a
plurality
opinion
written
by
justice
blackmun
speaking
for
four
justices.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
with
justice
o'connor
speaking
for
three
justices--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--joining
in
the
same
holding.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
there
was
a
dissent,
your
honor.
i
think
even
the
dissent,
in
my
view,
did
not
so
much
reject
the
narrow
rule
of
simmons,
the
rule
as
narrowly
stated
by
the
majority
in
simmons,
which
is
quite...
there
wasn't
a
majority,
but
the
rule
as
narrowly
stated
by
the
plurality
in
simmons
was
quite
specific.
when
you
have
an
allegation
of
future
dangerousness,
and
a
defendant
seeks
to
rebut
that
by
showing
that
he
is
ineligible...
ineligible
for
parole,
he
has
a
due
process
right
to
do
that.
i
do
not
read
the
dissent
as
rejecting
that
holding
so
much
as
the
dissent
in
simmons
says,
this
case
does
not
present
that
narrow
issue.
indeed--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
think
it
was
both,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
was
much
more
clearly
and
easily
a
due
process
than
an
eighth
amendment
case.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
the
text
does
limit
itself
to
the
eighth
amendment.
a
footnote
says--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--yes,
because
that
is
what
the
footnote
says,
mr
chief
justice.
the
footnote
says
in
so
many
words--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--not
always,
your
honor.
i
think
here
it's
not
strange
because
i
think
what
happened
is
the
court
wrote
a
difficult
and
disputed
eighth
amendment
opinion
and
dropped
a
footnote
to
say,
and
by
the
way,
there's
an
easy
due
process
route
to
the
same
result,
with
which
the
three
dissenters
agreed.
they
were
not
dissenters,
i'm
sorry.
they
concurred,
but
they
concurred
only
on
that
ground,
only
on
the
due
process
ground.
the--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--in
the
petition
itself--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--in
the...
we
did
not
mention
it
in
the
habeas
petition
itself.
we
did
on
direct
appeal
in
1988,
at
a
time
before
the
petitioner's
conviction
became
final.
we
did
argue
that
this
rule
was
compelled
by
skipper.
the...
i
think
the
facts
of
skipper
were
a
defendant
who
had...
was
charged
with
being
a
future
danger,
where
the
prosecution
was
trying
to
prove
future
dangerousness,
and
the
response
he
wanted
to
make
was,
i
have
behaved
well
in
prison
up
to
now,
and
therefore
i'm
not
going
to
be
so
dangerous
as
you
might
otherwise
think.
it
was
held
that
he
had
a...
unanimously
that
he
had
a
due
proces
right
to
do
that.
the
issue
in
simmons
seems
to
me
almost
a
fortiori...
when
he's
saying,
yeah,
it's
not
so
much
whether
my
behavior's
been
good
in
there,
but
you
want
to
know
whether
i'm
going
to
be
in
prison
or
not,
and
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
much
more
relevant
fact
on
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness
than
whether
the
man
is
going
to
get
out
or
not.
the--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--he
certainly
can,
and
the
prosecution--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--the...
but
he
can
be
dangerous
in
prison
and
the
prosecution
is
free
to
make
that
argument,
but
what
the
prosecution
prefers
to
do,
and
preferred
to
do
here,
is
frighten
the
jury
with
the
thought
that
he's
going
to
be
next
door
to
them
tomorrow,
that
he'll
be
out
on
the
street,
and
they...
that's
a
much
better
way
to
get
a
death
penalty.
of
course
the
prosecution
can
argue
life
without
parole
isn't
going
to
do
it
because
he's
going
to
kill
his
cell
mate,
and
the
defendant
has
to
try
to
meet
that
argument.
but
when
the
prosecution
says,
as
the
prosecutor
did
here,
isn't
it
interesting
that
he
can't
be
out
on
the
street
for
more
than
a
little
while
without
getting
into
trouble,
at
that
point
it
seems
to
me
fundamental,
obvious
that
the
defendant
should
be
allowed
to
get
up
and
say,
by
the
way,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
i'm
not
going
to
be
out
on
that
street
any
more.
this
is
it
for
me.
i'm
going
to
be
locked
up
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
the...
so--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--yes.
yes.
unless
the
law
changed,
but
you
know,
there
are--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--that...
that's
an
argument,
justice
scalia,
but
it
does
not
make
the
life
without
parole
situation
irrelevant.
the
life
without
parole
situation
is
still
almost
overwhelmingly
relevant.
the
almost
is
you
could
always
change
the
law.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
it
does
go
to
the
force
of
the
argument.
i
respectfully
submit,
justice
scalia
that
it's
still
a
very
powerful
argument
despite
the
fact
that
the
possibility
of
changing
the
law
does
exist.
it's
still...
in
a
future
dangerousness
case,
as
i
believe
one
of
the
opinions
in
simmons
said,
it's
about
the
best
argument
you've
got,
and
often
the
only
argument
you've
got,
that
i'm
going
to
be
locked
away
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
me,
that
may...
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
buy
it,
but
the
jury
certainly
may
buy
it.
it's
a
very
powerful
argument.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
think
it--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
think
it
is
explicit,
justice
kennedy,
but
it's
not
in
anything
like
the
context
that
we're
talking
about
here.
the
argument
was
made,
i
thought
a...
i
think
a
rather
weak
argument,
and
the
court
thought
it
a
rather
weak
argument
in
ramos.
the
argument
was
made
that
if
you're
going
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
life
sentence
is
subject
to
commutation...
that
was
the
main
issue
in
ramos...
then
you
must
also
tell
them
that
the
death
sentence
is
subject
to
commutation.
the
court's
response
was,
and
i'm
reading
from
i
think
3458
of
103
supreme
court.
the
court
was,
we
find
this
argument
puzzling.
a
jury...
i'm
skipping
a
little.
a
jury
concerned
about
preventing
the
defendant's
potential
return
to
society
will
not
be
any
less
inclined
to
vote
for
the
death
penalty
upon
learning
even
that
a
death
sentence
may
not
assure
the
prisoner's
removal
from
society.
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
made
in
ramos...
i'm
sorry,
the
respondent
in
ramos,
that
the
prisoner
made
in
ramos,
and
that
the
court
rejected,
was
simply
an
illogical
argument
and
was
rejected
as
illogical.
beyond
that,
justice
kennedy,
ramos
didn't
present
a
right-of-rebuttal
situation
at
all,
and
the
court
noted
that.
ramos
was
not
a
case
where
the
state
was
saying
this
man
will
be
dangerous
and
the
prisoner
was
saying...
standing
up
and
saying
let
me
show
the
jury
something
that
makes
me
not
so
dangerous.
that
is
not
what
was
going
on.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
we
have...
well,
we
didn't
have
a
tactical
decision
in
this
case,
your
honor.
because
we
tried
to
make
the
decision.
the
decision
was
taken
out
of
our
hands.
we
said...
my
client
said
i
want
to
tell
the
jury
i'm
facing
life
without
parole.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
do
not
think
that
ramos
says
or
even
suggests
that
this
particular
choice
is
open
to
the
states,
your
honor.
ramos
does
say
the...
what
ramos
holds,
of
course,
is
that
it's
okay
for
a
state
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
life
sentence
is...
life
without
parole
can
be
commuted
to
a
sentence
of
life
with
parole.
it
says
in
dictum
that
the
state
could
make
another
choice.
it
does
not
say
or
imply
that
the
state
could
make
that
choice
in
a
context
where
it's
forbidding
the
defendant
from
rebutting.
indeed,
the
choice
that's
referred
to
in
ramos
i
think
pretty
clearly
is
a
choice
to
be
more
favorable
to
the
defendant
than
california
had
chosen
to
be,
a
choice
to
remain
silent
about
the
possibility
of
parole,
and
those
are
the
words...
the
possibility
of
parole,
not
the
impossibility
or
the
unlikelihood,
the
ineligibility
of
parole.
a
state,
the
court
said
in
ramos,
can
choose
to
give
more
protection
than
the
constitution
requires
by
remaining
silent
on
that
subject.
it
did
not
say
or
imply
that
the
court
may
silence
the
defendant
on
that
subject,
may
forbid
him
from
bringing
this
truthful
information
to
the
jury's
attention
even
where
it
is
the
only
information
that
can
rebut
the
charge
of
future
dangerousness.
the...
i
think
it's...
skipper
is
indeed
extremely
close
and
ramos
extremely
distant.
i
guess
i
would
add
that
even
if
it
were
not
so,
even
if
i
didn't
have
a
case
as
closely
on
point
as
skipper,
it
would
still
be
true
that
the
rule
in
simmons
should
not
be
considered
a
new
rule,
because
i
think
that
a
relevant
factor
is
not
only
the
closeness
of
the
prior
precedent,
but
the
egregiousness
of
the
practice
that
is
being
condemned.
and
i
think
the
practice
here,
which
really
did
exist
here...
it
may
not
have
existed
in
simmons,
as
the
dissenting
justices
thought
it
did
not.
the
majority
thought
it
did...
but
it
clearly
exists
here,
is
the
practice
of
scaring
the
jury
about
a
dangerous
man
being
back
on
the
streets
of
their
community
without
telling
them
that
there
happens
to
be
a
state
statute
that
forbids
under
any
circumstances
putting
him
back
on
the
streets
of
that
community.
to
me
it
is
almost
as
bad...
i
will
grant
the
almost,
but
almost
as
bad
as
if
a
state
had
passed
a
law
saying
in
a
criminal
case
we
will
no
longer
permit
a
defendant
to
present
the
defense
of
alibi.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
well,
you're
making
the
distinction,
justice
scalia,
between
he's
not
dangerous
by
reason
of
his
character,
and
he's
not
dangerous
by
reason
of
his
circumstances.
i
don't
think
there's
much
persuasive
force
to
that
distinction.
it's
true
that
skipper
is
not
the
absolutely
identical
case,
and
you
don't
have
to
have
an
identical
case.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
don't
think
it's
correct,
justice
scalia,
to
say
that
before
simmons
the
sentencing
determination
was
limited
to
character.
i
think
that
for...
going
back
to
the
time
when
in
jurek
and
other
cases
these
statutes
were
upheld,
the
jury
was
assigned
a
predictive
function
as
well
as
a
function
of
judging
the
defendant's
character.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
or
what...
if
he's
terminally
ill?
i
think...
yes,
i
would
be
startled
if
he
didn't
have
a
due
process
right
to
tell
the
jury
that
if
i'm
terminally--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--okay.
i
am
certainly
putting
my
main
emphasis
on
its
not
being
a
new
rule,
but
i
think
if
it
were
new,
i
would
have
a
good
case
under
the
teague
second
exception.
i
have...
it's
a
difficult
argument
to
make,
because
i
have
to
make
what
i
think
is
the
false
assumption
that
there's
something
new
about
the
idea
of
giving
this
due
process
right
to
the
prisoner.
that
is,
i
have
to
assume
a
world
which
i
don't
think
ever
existed
in
which
it
was
generally
accepted
that
you
could
charge
a
man
with
being
dangerous
in
the
future
and
forbid
him
from
informing
the
jury
that
he's
going
to
be
unparolable
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
it's
hard
to...
for
me
it's
hard
to
imagine
that
world.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
if
i
make
that
assumption,
then
i
say
that
the
whole
point,
i
think,
of
the
second
teague
exception
is
to
deal
with
really
egregious,
shocking
practices
that
create
a
high
risk
of
a
wrong
determination,
a
high
risk
of
finding
someone
dangerous
who
is
in
fact
harmless.
that's
why
there
is
a
second
teague
exception.
it
doesn't
happen
every
day,
and
i
think
the
reason
it
doesn't
happen
every
day
is
that
usually,
when
you
find
a
practice
as
egregious
as
this,
it's
really
clear
that
it
was
never
approved.
it
was
never
thought
of
as
fair--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i'm
relying
on
both
in
the
sense,
justice
stevens,
this
is
a
fortiori
from
simmons.
that
is,
even
if
simmons
had
never
been
decided,
i
think
i
could
stand
here
and
say
a
decision
here
is
compelled
by
skipper,
and
without
going
to
the
intervening
stages.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
skipper
is
the
more
factually
analogous
authority.
gardner
is
at
a
higher
level
of
generality,
and
the
cases
do
say
that
you
take
into
account
the
level
of
generality,
so
if
i
had
only
gardner,
it
would
not
be
as
clear
a
case
as
i
think
it
is.
but
even
if
it
were
only
gardner,
i
would
make
the
argument
i
started
to
make
a
minute
ago
about,
suppose
an
alibi
defense
were
prohibited,
and
suppose...
suppose
there's
not
a
case.
maybe
there
is,
but
suppose
there's
not
a
case
that
ever
said
that
a
defendant
had
a
constitutional
right
to
present
an
alibi
defense.
we
know
that
he
has
that
right.
we
know
that
whether
there's
a
case
on
it
or
not.
of
course
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
present
an
alibi
defense,
and
it's
not
a
new
rule.
here,
it's
almost
that
egregious.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
there
was
a
plurality
opinion,
but
the
due
process
holding
did
get
five
votes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
justice
marshall
and
justice
brenna
i
believe
both
wrote
separately.
justice
brennan's
decision
is
styled
a
concurrence
and
justice
marshall's
a
dissent,
but
on
this
issue
they
say
the
same
thing.
they
say
we
agree
with
the
plurality
opinion
on
the
due
process
issue.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
would
say
the
facts,
justice
souter,
but
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
well,
i
think...
yes.
i
don't
think
i
absolutely
have
to
show
a
misrepresentation
here,
although
it's...
they
think
i
can't.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yes.
there
was
no...
it
could.
it
could
indeed.
it's
the
same
kind
of
misrepresentation,
actually,
you
had
in
skipper.
the
argument
was
made
in
skipper
by
the
prosecution,
this
is
a
bad
person.
he
kicked
the
bars
of
his
cell,
and
therefore
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
rebut.
it
was
noted
factually
true
that
he
kicked
the
bars
of
his
cell.
that
wasn't
a
misrepresentation,
but
there
was
an
implied
misrepresentation
that
he
was
a
bad
actor
in
prison,
and
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
disprove
that.
here,
the
statement
is
made
as
soon
as
this
guy
is
out
in
the
community
he
does
something
horrible.
i
assume
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
that
was
perfectly
true,
but
there's
an
implied
misrepresentation
that
you're
going
to
see
him
out
there
in
the
community,
and
i
think
he
had
a
due
process
right
to
respond
to
that.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
think
teague,
as
i
understand
teague,
it
applies
in
noncapital
cases
in
generally
the
same
way.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
well,
i'm
not...
i
may
be
missing
the
point
of
your
question,
but
i
think
obviously
there's
a
difference
in
that
in
the...
where
there's
not
a
death
case
the
issue
is
usually
guilt
or
innocence,
and
the
cases
describing
the
second
exception
tend
to
talk
in
terms
of
the
conviction
of
the
innocent.
i
think
it's
clear...
i
don't
think
anyone's
really
arguing
the
contrary...
that
the
execution
of
someone
who
ought
not
to
be
executed
is
analogous
to
the
conviction
of
the
innocent,
or
a
finding
of
dangerousness
which
is
a
basis
for
execution
of
a
man
who
does
not,
in
fact,
present
a
danger
would
be
analogous
to
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
person,
but
i'm
not
sure
i've
answered
your
question.
there
may
be
something
else.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
think
the
answer
is--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--first,
the
literal
answer
to
your
question
i
suppose
is
yes,
it
went
to
the
possibility
of
eliminating
the
person
from
the
community.
the
distinction
is
that,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
ramos
as
a
basis
for
its
holding
on
that
issue
in
ramos,
is
that
the
instruction
that
the
defendant
was
asking
for
was
logically
irrelevant
to
the
decision
the
jury
had
to
make,
or
if,
indeed,
it
wasn't
harmful.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
don't
think,
justice...
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
actually,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
was
a
south
carolina
statute
invalidated
in
simmons,
but
i...
i
think
it
was
a
practice
that
they
found
the
supreme
court
to
have
sanctioned.
but
the...
i
also
don't
think
that
the
language
you're
quoting
was
in
the
context...
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
context
of
the
holding
that
ramos
was
not
entitled
to
the
instruction
on
the
governor's
power
to
commute
the
death
penalty.
i
think
the
context
of
that
was,
we're
saying
its
okay
for
the
states
to
tell
the
jury
about
the
governor's
power
to
commute
a
life
without
parole
sentence,
and
p.s.,
it's
also
okay
not
to
tell
them
and
to
give
the
defendant
more
protection,
but
the
two...
it's
not
only
in
the
context
of
giving
the
defendant
more
protection.
it's
also
completely
foreign
from
the
right
of
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
think
not.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
don't
think
law
is
any
more
subject
to
change
than
any
other
future
event
or
condition
like,
for
example,
good
behavior,
which
was
the
issue
in
skipper.
good
behavior
can
change,
too,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
law
in
simmons,
it
was
a
law
but
it
was
really
just
a
fact
that
was
subject
to
judicial
notice,
otherwise
it
was
like
any
other
fact.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
certainly.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i'm
not--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
must
say,
i
don't
detect
that
great
concern
in
simmons,
justice
kennedy.
the
argument
of
course
can
be
made
that
parole
is
so
inherently
confusing
that
it
should
never
go
to
the
jury,
but
it's
tough
to
make
that
argument
when
you
have
a
statute
that
says
life
without
parole,
period,
and
the
only
complication
is
well,
maybe
they'll
change
the
statute
some
day.
that's
a
complexity
not
beyond
a
jury's
ability
to
deal
with,
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
was
a...
was
something
the
court
really
had
to
struggle
with
in
simmons.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
want
to
address
briefly
the
idea
that
the
death
sentence
here
was
the
result
of
the
fear
that
he
would
be
dangerous
in
prison,
which
has
been
an
argument
made
both
in
the
harmless
error
context
and
also
in
the
context
of
suggesting
that
it
was
reasonable
to...
a
reasonable
jurist
in
1983
might
have
taken
that
approach.
i
think
the...
that
what
happened
here
is
very
closely
analogous
to
what
happened
in
skipper.
i'm
not
saying
that
improper
arguments
were
made.
very
fair
arguments
were
made,
but
the
arguments
had
nothing
to
do,
or
at
least
did
not
advertise
themselves
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
man's
dangerousness
in
prison.
the
prosecutor
had
what
you
might
think
is
this
absolutely
wonderful
fact
that
a
prison
murder
had
occurred,
and
did
not
even
mention
in
his
closing
argument
that
that
murder
was
in
prison.
indeed,
he
put
it
in
the
middle
of
a...
what
he
called
an
ascending
hierarchy,
and
chose
to
stress
the
more
serious
things
that
had
happened
afterwards.
he
talks
about
a
night
stalker.
he
talks
about
the
man
at
large
on
dark
and
rainy
nights,
and
then
he
uses
the
language
that
i
think
justice
souter
read.
isn't
it
interesting
that
he
is
only
able
to
be
outside
of
the
prison
system
for
a
matter
of
months
to
a
year-and-a-half
before
something
has
happened
again.
but
what
is
interesting
about
it?
what's
interesting
about
it,
of
course,
is
that
it
generates
in
the
jury
the
thought
that
this
might
recur.
it's
not
an
improper
argument.
it's
a
perfectly
fair
argument
as
long
as
the
defendant
is
allowed
to
rebut
it,
but
it
cries
aloud
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
within--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
guess
i
just...
i
respectfully
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
what
is
obviously
happening
is
that
you
have
someone
whom
the
prosecution
is
portraying
successfully
as
a
terrifying
individual,
that
for
him
to
be
able
to
say,
i'm
facing
life
without
parole
is
such
an
obvious
thing.
it
is
so
obviously
unfair
to
prevent
him
from
doing
that.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
don't
think
that's
what
ms.
baldwin
said.
he
never
said
that
he
would
be
ineligible
for
parole.
he
said,
i'm
45
years
old.
i've
got
to
do,
what
he
called
a
flat
16
years
because
i've
got
a
parole
violation,
and
therefore
he
drew
the
inference
something
like,
i
ain't
never
gonna
get
out.
that
to
me
is
not
nearly
comparable,
does
not
render
harmless
at
all
the
simmons
error
to
say
that,
assuming
the
jury
understood
and
believed
what
he
was
saying,
which
is
a
big
assumption,
that's
a
long
way
from
saying
i'm
facing
life
without
parole.
he
tried
to
say
it.
he
proffered
that
testimony
and
it
was
objected
to.
he
asked
for
an
instruction,
and
by
the
way
an
instruction
has
nothing...
even
though
it's
an
instruction
as
a
matter
of
fact,
an
instruction
is
simply
a
way
that
you
judicially
notice
facts
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
he
wanted
to
put
this
fact,
the
fact
that
he
was
facing
life
without
parole,
before
the
jury.
he
wanted
to
put
it
in
in
rebuttal
of
an
argument
that
was
made
and
made
very
effectively
that
he
was
a
dangerous
person
who
could
not
be
in
the
community
for
more
than
a
few
months
without
causing
trouble.
he
was
not
permitted
to
do
that.
that
was
an
obvious
violation
of
due
process.
it
would
have
been
a
clear
violation
of
due
process
to
a
reasonable
jurist
in
1988.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'll
conclude.
