he
can
be
dangerous
in
prison,
i
assume,
can't
he?

murders
in

occur
with
some

unless
the
law
changes.
he
would
have
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
would
be
no
way
to
guarantee
the
jury
that
this
man
would
not
be
back
on
the
street.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
force
of
the
injustice
that
you're
describing.
i
mean,
you
know,
whether
this
argument
that
was
excluded
would
be
of
such
overpowering
force.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
the
defense
is
dangerous,
whether
he
is
a
dangerous
person,
and
that's
all
that
skipper
involved.
they
allowed
him
to
put
in
evidence
in
skipper
that
he
had
not
been
dangerous
when
he
was
incarcerated,
that
he
had
indeed
engaged
in
good
behavior
in
prison,
so
the
jury
could
conclude
on
the
basis
of
that
he
is
not
a
dangerous
person.
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
it
is
obvious
from
that
that
you
can
put
in
evidence,
not
that
he's
not
a
dangerous
person,
but
as...
but
that
although
he
is
a
dangerous
person,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
because
he's
going
to
be
in
jail.
now,
that's
a
step
further.
i
agree
it
may
be
a
good
argument,
and
it's
an
argument
you
might
want
to
make,
but
it's
a
step
further
than
what
we
had
held
up
to
that
time,
which
is,
you
can
bring
in
evidence
to
show
that
in
fact
he's
not
a
dangerous
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's...
i
think
it's
a
long
way...
sentencing
determinations
are
usually
made
on
the
basis
of
what
the
defendant
did
and
what
his
character
is,
and
that's
typically
what
a
sentencing
jury
takes
into
account,
and
skipper
was
well
within
that.
you
wanted
to
show
the
man's
character
is
not
so
bad.
he
behaved
very
well
in
jail.
now
you
come
in
with
a
totally
new
argument.
i
don't
want
to
tell
the
jury
that
he
behaved
very
well.
he
is
a
bad
man.
he's
very
dangerous.
however,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
him.
he'll
be
behind
bars.
now,
that
may
well
be...
we
held
that
that
is
an
argument
you
should
be
able
to
get
before
the
jury,
but
it's
a
quite
different
argument
from
the
argument
that
this
is
not
a
dangerous
man.
justice
antonin
scalia
predictive
of
his
behavior,
not
of
the
circumstances
of
the
world.
not
of
whether
he's
going
to
die
at
55
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
if
you
only
give
him
10
years
instead
of
20.
should
he
be
able
to
get
that
evidence
in
on
the
basis
of
skipper?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
could
i
ask
you
to
come
back
to
ramos?
it
seems
to
me
you
understate
the
relevance
of
ramos
to
this
question.
what
ramos
held
is
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
the
right
to
have
the
jury
instructed
that,
regardless
of
whether
you
impose
the
death
penalty
or
life
imprisonment
the
penalty
can
be
reduced
or
commuted.
now,
doesn't
that
go
to
the
same
issue
that
is
involved
here,
namely
whether
the
sentence
you
impose
will
eliminate
the
dangerousness
of
this
individual?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
defendant
wanted
to
tell
the
jury,
look,
you're
not
going
to
eliminate
this
man's
dangerousness
by
imposing
the
death
penalty,
because
that
can
be
eliminated
by
the
governor.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
all
it
said.
the
court
said
in
ramos
that
we...
it
has
deferred
to
the
state's
choice
of
substantive
factors
relevant
to
the
penalty
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
at
that
point
cites
a
georgia
statute
identical
to
the
south
carolina
statute
later
invalidated
in
simmons.
is
that
no
evidence
that
such
a
statute
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'll
check
that...
you
think
it
didn't
go
to
the
commutation
of
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
i
share
your
puzzlement
about
the
second
exception,
which
seems
to
say
we're
not
going
to
allow
new
rules
to
overturn
settled
cases
unless
it's
a
really
new
rule,
then
we
will
allow
it.
it
seems
a
racher
strange
exception
to
the
rule.
may
i
ask
a
factual
question,
ms.
baldwin?
you
mentioned
that
the...
apparently
the
jury
was
apprised
of
the
fact
that
this
man
had
committed
a
murder
while
he
was
in
prison
before.
i
don't
find
reference
to
that
in
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument,
and
i
notice
in
your
brief
your
citation
for
that
is
to
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
and
i
just
wondered,
did
this
come
out
at
the
trial
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
at
the
penalty
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
recur.
i
mean,
all
the
defendant
can
say
is,
well,
as
the
current
law
is,
he
wouldn't
get
out.
should
the
state
be
able
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
the
current
law
may
be
changed?
in
fact,
it
was
changed
only
2
years
ago.
or
introduce
statistics
about
how
state
laws
are
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
understand
that,
you
know,
that's
not
how
we
ultimately
concluded,
but
i
don't
know
that
you
couldn't
have
looked
at
it
that
way
at
that
time
and
just
said,
we
don't
want
to
get
into
all
these
things.
