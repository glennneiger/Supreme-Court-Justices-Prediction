ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
begin
by
setting
the
record
straight
on
something
that
o'dell
has
argued
this
morning,
and
which
this
case
is
not
about.
o'dell
is
apparently
relying
not
only
on
a
lack
of
a
simmons
instruction,
but
he
apparently
today
now
says
he's
also
relying
on
some
argument
that
the
prosecutor
made
some
improper
argument,
and
that
that
is
a
separate
type
of
rebuttal
issue,
and
there
was
never,
and
there
has
never
been
a
claim
in
this
case
of
improper
prosecutorial
argument.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but
counsel--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--correct,
and
i
don't
believe
there's
ever
been
a
claim
in
this
case
that
the
prosecutor
misrepresented
the
law
to
this
jury,
and
in
fact--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--he
was
not
allowed...
correct,
he
was
not
allowed
a
simmons
instruction,
but
if
this
prosecutor
had
in
any
way
directed
this
jury
that
o'dell
was
going
to
get
out
on
parole,
that
would
have
been
an
issue
that
would
have
been
reversed
immediately
and
automatically
by
the
supreme
court.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
there
was
never
an
objection
to
the
prosecutor's
argument
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form,
and
if
it
had
been,
and
if
the
record
had
supported
that,
the
virginia
supreme
court
would
have
reversed
that
conviction.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes,
the
simmons
right.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
right,
but
the
type--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that
is
the
simmons
claim,
and
in
1994
that
would
have
been
error.
that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
in
1988,
it's
our
position
there
was
no
error
in
this
case,
because
there
was
no
such
due
process
right
of
rebuttal.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--no...
justice
souter,
actually
i
disagree
with
that
completely.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
misleading
or
misrepresentation
of
what
virginia
law
was
in
this
case.
the
only
thing--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes,
justice
o'connor--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
think
that
is--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
absolutely.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
the
only
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
on
this
particular...
it
seems
to
be
a
secondary
argument
that
has
been
made,
is
that
it
doesn't
in
any
way
fit
this
case.
o'dell
was
the
one
who
mentioned
the
word
parole
before
this
jury
to
begin
with.
the
issue
never
came
up
until
in
his
cross-examination
of
donna
doyle
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
he
cross-examined
her
about
the
florida...
the
failure
of
the
florida
parole
system,
so
there's
none
of
this
skipper-type
of
rebuttal.
in
other
words,
in
skipper,
the
prosecutor
was
arguing,
this
individual
is
going
to
be
dangerous
in
jail.
in
fact,
he's
going
to
rape
other
prisoners.
that
was
the
argument
the
prosecutor
made
in
skipper,
and
the
defendant
was
not
allowed
to
rebut
that
with
evidence
that
he
was
not
going
to
be...
that
he
would
be
of
good
behavior
in
jail.
that
is
not...
there
is
no
such
rebuttal
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
the
only
issue
was
a
simmons
issue.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
yes,
justice
stevens,
and
that
was
on
cross...
that
was
on
cross-examination,
after
o'dell
extensively,
in
his
own
direct
examination,
had
presented
to
the
jury
his
entire
criminal
history,
when
he
was
out
on
parole--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--he
did
represent
himself,
but
stand-by
counsel
was
the
one
who
conducted
his
direct
examination.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
don't
believe
that
that's
a--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
don't
believe
that
that's
a
fair
inference
from
the
prosecutor's
argument.
the
prosecutor
was
arguing
his
history,
his
past
criminal
history,
which
included
the
fact
that
he
committed
crimes
when
he
was
on
parole,
which
had
been
presented
to
begin
with
by
o'dell
so
that
was...
that's
separate
from
the
o...
from
the
simmons--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--oh,
absolutely,
in
this
case
in
particular,
because
o'dell
had
committed
murder
in
prison,
and
the
jury
was
well--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--and
the
jury...
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
the
jury
was
well
aware
of
that,
so
we
have
that
argument
under
our
harmless
error
argument.
in
fact,
to
go
to
the
point
that
this
would
have...
parole
information
to
this
jury
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
anyway.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
under
harmless
error.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
he
objected
to
it
because
under
virginia
law
it
was
absolutely
not
allowed
that
juries
receive
information
about
parole
whether
it
benefited
the
prosecution
or
the
defendant,
and
that
was
a
clear...
that
was
clear
law
in
virginia.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
he
actually
to
his
benefit
was
allowed
over
the
prosecutor's
objection
to
testify
to
the
jury,
i
will
never
get
out
of
prison,
and
the
judge
actually
allowed
that
testimony,
even
though
the
prosecutor
objected.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
i
believe
he
was
doing
nothing
but
arguing
history.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
no.
that
would
have
been
a
prosecutor
misleading
the
jury
on
a
matter
of
state
law,
affirmatively
misleading--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--and
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
correct
that,
and
that
would
have
been
reversed.
that's
why
no
virginia
prosecutor
would
have
ever
made
such
an
argument,
because
they
knew
that
their
cases
would
have
been
reversed
if
they
had
told
juries
improper
information,
anything
to
do
with
this
man's
future
parole.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
very
important
here
and
significant
is,
actually
is
a
1952
case
from
virginia,
jones
v.
commonwealth,
and
this
is
a
case
which
the
ramos
supreme
court,
the
california
supreme
court
had
relied
on.
and
in
jones
v.
commonwealth
the
rationale
for
the
states,
and
which
they
believed
was
the
majority
rule...
was
the
majority
of
states
believe
this,
and
that
was
that
even
if
the
defendant
was
ineligible
for
parole,
because
that's
what
happened
in
jones
v.
commonwealth
and
he
wanted
an
instruction,
the
virginia
supreme
court
said,
well
now,
if
we
have
to
instruct
him
on
that,
to
have
a
completely
accurate
instruction
we
would
also
have
to
tell
them
that
really
doesn't
guarantee
he
won't
be
released,
because
the
governor
could
commute
it.
in
other
words,
the
briggs
instruction.
and
virginia
supreme
court
said,
we're
not
going
down
that
road.
we
are
not
going
to
allow
that,
because
that
would
be
so
prejudicial.
and
in
1988,
the
most
significant
factor
that
shows
that
the
virginia
supreme
court's
decision
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
existing
law
is
the
fact
that
no
other
case
anywhere
had
held
that
virginia's
practice
was
unconstitutional.
and
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
as
you
pointed
out,
that
the
simmons
case
itself
was
not
unanimous,
and
i
think
that
is
compelling,
if
not
dispositive
evidence
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
new
rule
because
it
obviously
was
susceptible
to
debate
among
reasonable
jurists.
but
in
1988,
under
ramos,
it
was
very
clear
from
ramos
that
the
decision
of
whether
states
should
even...
should,
could,
or
should
not
instruct
juries
about
any
matters
that
come
after
the
verdict
about
commutation,
pardon,
and
parole--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--which
is
clearly
within
the
discretion
of
the
states.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
would
disagree
with
that
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
simmons
said.
i
don't
believe
that
simmons
is
a
rule
of
defining
for
juries,
or
giving
them
definite
instructions
about
a
sentencing
option.
simmons
is
a
case
about
rebuttal
of
future
dangerousness,
a
due
process
right
of
rebuttal
of
future
dangerousness,
and
nothing
else.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
an
instruction
being
inaccurate.
it's
not...
that
is
not
the
rule
of
simmons.
and
secondly,
in
1988,
i
think
the
equally
important
case
to
ramos
that
was
out
there
was
caldwell,
and
i
think
caldwell
clearly
told
states
that
if
you
want
to
correct
jurors'
possible
misapprehensions
about
appellate
procedures,
or
we
can
infer
from
that
anything
that
comes
after
the
jury
verdict,
then
you
may
do
that,
state,
if
you
want
to,
but...
and
the
controlling
concurring
opinion
in
caldwell
said
specifically
that's
a
matter
of...
that's
a
policy
choice
to
be
made
for
a
state.
so
i'm
a
court
in
1988.
i
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
law
governing
this
issue
that
o'dell
is
bringing
before
me
is
not
only
ramos,
but
it's
also
caldwell,
that
says
these
matters
are
policy
choice.
and
in
fact
i
think
that
it
was
the
prudent
course
in
1988
for
a
court
to
decide
not
to
instruct
their
juries
about...
or
take
on
that
task
of
trying
to
disabuse
them
of
misperceptions
that
they
may
have
about
appellate
commutation,
pardon,
and
parole
procedures,
because
it's
in
my
view
in
1988,
as
a
reasonable
jurist,
that's
too
speculative.
it's
getting
too
far
away
from
the
matter
at
hand,
and
that
is,
what
is
the
appropriate
sentence
for
this
individual,
and
i
think
there
was
complete
support
for
that.
the
virginia
supreme
court
relied
on
ramos,
the
fourth
circuit
relied
on
ramos,
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
ramos,
and
this
court's
decision
in
simmons
was
not
even
unanimous,
so
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
a
legitimate
argument
made
that
this
was
not
a
new
rule.
i
wanted
to
address
briefly
the
question
about
this
being
a
watershed,
fulfilling
the
second
exception
to
teague
or
not,
and
i
think
that
this
court's
cases
on
the
second
exception
have
made
absolutely
clear
that
the
rule
has
to
do
something
more
than
just
improve
accuracy.
it
has
to
do
something
more
than
that.
it
has
to
literally
alter
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
covering
criminal
cases.
it
has
to
be
something
that...
the
terminology
that's
been
used
is
groundbreaking,
and
in
specific--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--they
are
not
synonymous--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
no.
i
think
that
you
can
have
a
new
rule...
i
mean...
well,
i
don't
know.
that's
a
difficult
question,
because
i
think
that
if
you
are
faithful
to
this
standard--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
come
up
with
a
rule
that
will
ever
meet
the
second
teague
exception.
and
there's
a
reason
for
that,
and
that's
because
the
entire
purpose
of
the
new
rule
doctrine
is
to
validate
and
uphold
judgments
and
a
finality
of
judgments
that
were
reasonable
when
they
were
made,
and
so
it
should
not
be
an
exception,
and
this
court
in
gecky
v.
branch
specifically
said,
if...
just
because
a
practice
is
claimed
to
have
been
shocking,
which
i
submit
it
definitely
is
not,
but
that's
o'dell's
argument,
that
does
not
mean
that
it
qualifies
as
a
gideon-type
new...
exception
to
the
new
rule
doctrine.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
don't
think
so,
unless
it
met
this
standard
of
this
primacy
and
centrality.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
something
that
is
a
particular
practice
in
one
case.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
i
don't
think
that
alone
would
satisfy
the
second
exception.
it
would
have
to
be...
whatever
it
is,
this
court
would
have
to
be
willing
to
say
that
this
is
like
gideon.
this
is
that
ground--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--it
has
to
be
more
than
that.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
i'm
going
to
agree
that...
i
cannot
possibly
conceive
of
a
rule,
frankly,
that
would
meet
the
second
exception,
so
i
would
say
even
under
those
circumstances
not.
but
you
know--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--oh,
right.
if
that's--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--if
that's
the
case
then
it's
not
a
new
rule
and
we
don't
even
get
to
that.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes,
and--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--you
don't
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case
anyway.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
because
all
simmons
is...
all
simmons
was,
was
essentially
an
exception
that
was
carved
out
of
the
ramos
general
rule
of
deference
to
states
to
decide
whether
to
instruct
juries
about
parole
or
not.
this
is
really
nothing
more
than
an
additional...
an
incremental
change,
but...
an
important
change,
but
nevertheless
an
incremental
exception
that
has
been
carved
out
of
that
heretofore
general
deference
that
states
knew
that
they
had
in
these--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that's
why
i
don't
think
it
satisfies
the
second
exception.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
oh,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the...
his...
during
the
prosecution's
case
in
the
sentencing
hearing
the
only
thing
the
prosecutor
presented--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--at
the
penalty
hearing.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
the
only
thing
that
the
prosecutor
presented
in
his
case
in
chief
was
o'dell's
prior
conviction
orders,
which
showed
what
he'd
been
convicted
of,
and
one
of
the
was
a
second
degree
murder,
and
then
he
also...
they
also
presented
donna
doyle,
who
had
been--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--attacked
by
o'dell
10
years
before.
and
then
o'dell
in
his
case,
when
he
came
in,
he
went
into
great
detail
explaining
to
the
jury
about
this
murder
that
had
occurred
in
prison,
because
it
was
the
killing
of
another
inmate,
and
he
had
an
explanation
that
he
gave
to
the
jury.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
he
referred
to
the
murder,
on
page
61
of
the
appendix.
he
did
not
refer
to...
he
did
not
describe
it
as
a
murder
that
occurred
in
prison.
he
says,
there
is
a
graduation
of
seriousness
of
the
offenses
from
use
of
a
car,
to
a
robbery,
to
a
murder,
to
an
abduction,
and
another
robbery,
and
now
to
another
murder,
so
he
listed
it.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
and
i
think
that
was
a
fair
argument
considering
o'dell's
obvious
strategy
to
present
this
to
the
jury.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
this
was.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
do
not
believe
it
at
all.
as
this
court
has
stated
many
times,
the
purpose
of
teague
is
to
promote
finality
for
state
court
judgments
and
to
uphold
those
which
were
valid
when
made.
the
virginia
supreme
court's
decision
in
o'dell
was
made
in
good
faith
reliance
on
precedent
that
was
existing
at
the
time,
and
there
was
no
decision
anywhere
that
dictated
a
different
result
in
1988.
virginia
should
be
permitted
to
carry
out
the
sentence
in
this
case--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
think
specifically
for
the
reasons
underlying
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule
doctrine
to
begin
with,
and
those
are
irrespective
of
sentence.
the...
we
always
have
to
look
back
and
say
what
the
new
rule
doctrine...
it
was
meant
to
promote
finality
of
judgments,
and
to
uphold...
to
uphold
judgments
which
were
valid
when
made
so
that
courts
can
know
that
if
they
reasonably
and
in
good
faith
apply
constitutional
precedent
that
exists
at
the
time
they're
making
their
decision
they
can
be
assured
that
those
judgments
will
remain
valid,
and
i
think
that
that
is
irrespective
of
the
sentence
in
the
case,
and
i
don't
think
there's...
there
definitely
should
not
be
an
exception,
because
it
would...
i
think
it
would
destroy
the
new
rule
doctrine.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
for
the
second
exception?
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
i
don't--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
don't
believe
that
that's
what
this
court
has
said
defines
the
second
exception.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--but
i
think
that
that's
what
simmons
said
in
1994.
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
1994,
and
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
position.
to
use
simmons
as
the
prism
through
which
we
look
back
at
other
cases
is
what
the
new
rule
doctrine
says
we
can't
do.
you've
got
to
go
back
in
time
and
say,
is
that
what
courts
thought
in
1988.
and
i
submit
a
perfectly
reasonable,
i
think
rationale
for
the
rule
in
1988
was
that
courts
for
one
thing
did
not
consider
rebuttal,
i
think,
in
the
way
that
simmons
described
rebuttal.
i
mean,
they...
i
think
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it
was
reasonable
for
a
court
to
believe
that
you
were
not
rebutting
future
dangerousness
by
showing
that
you
were
going
to
be
parole-ineligible,
because
by
doing
that
you
were
showing
that
you
had
a
horrendous
record,
so
terrible
that
the
state
was
not
going
to
let
you
out
on
parole.
a
reasonable
court
i
think
would
have
not
thought
that
was
rebuttal.
i
mean,
and
in
addition,
all
of
the
arguments
that
this...
if
we
go
down
that
road
it's
going
to
be
so
speculative
it's
going
to
end
up
prejudicing
the
defendant,
because
if
you
want
to
give
a
complete
picture
you're
going
to
have
to
come
in
and
show
that
the
governor
could
let
him
out,
he
could
escape
from
prison,
any
number
of
things
that
would
deflect
the
jury,
i
believe.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'll
conclude.
