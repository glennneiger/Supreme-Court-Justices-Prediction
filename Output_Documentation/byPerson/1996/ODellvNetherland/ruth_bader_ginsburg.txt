mr.
smith,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
hard
question
at
the
outset.
if
you
are
contending
that
we're
dealing
with
nothing
new
in
the
simmons
decision,
what
do
you
say
about
the
4-1-4
split
on
this
court
about
whether
the
simmons
rule
was
even
required
by
the
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
recall
what
the
split
was,
but
in
any
event
there
was
a
split.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask,
because
your
time
is
running
short,
whether
you
are
putting
your
main
emphasis
on,
not
a
new
rule
under
teague,
or
whether
you
think
you
have
a
good
case
under
the
teague
second
exception,
and
if
you
think
that
you
do,
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
make
the
assumption
that
this
court
rules
against
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
your
teague
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
for
purposes
of
the
teague
exception
does
it
matter
whether
it's
a
death
case
or
a
habeas
case
where
somebody
has
a
term
of
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
there
are
exceptions.
there
are
the
two
exceptions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
we're
dealing
with
the
second,
and
my
question
to
you
is,
is
there
any
basis
for
taking
a
different
approach
to
that
second
exception
when
it's
a
death
case
rather
than
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
sentenced
to
a
term
of
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
baldwin,
if
there
is
any
content
at
all
to
that
second
exception,
why
shouldn't
it
be
for
a
case
where
literally
it's
a
life
or
death
choice?
