justice
john
paul
stevens
you
left
out
part
of
the
sentence,
though,
i
think,
didn't
you,
mr.
phillips?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
left
out
part
of
the
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it...
or
of
the...
or,
and
of
the
proposed
disposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
valuation
and
of
proposed
disposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
valuation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
only
gives
that
protection
to
the
extent
that
there...
the
value
of
the
lien
can
be
realized
through
sale
of
the
collateral.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
really
puzzled
by
that.
because
if
you
proceeded
under
state
law,
you'd
get
what
the
other
side
says
you
should
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
foreclose,
you'd
sell
the
it
and
you
would
get
the
wholesale
value.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
you
still
are
here
as
a
general
creditor,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
all
you'd
be
under
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
under
state
law,
if
you
had
a
$50,000
debt,
secured
by
collateral
worth
40,000,
you'd
foreclose,
you'd
get
your
40,000,
and
you'd
be
a
general
creditor
for
the
10,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
you're
getting
the
periodic
payment.
is
it
not
true,
though,
that
you
do
have
the
status
of
a
general
creditor
as
to
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i,
just
before...
you're
talking
about
replacement...
market
value
rather
than
replacement
cost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
submission,
is
that
the
same
or
different
from
replacement
cost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can't
answer
it
yes
or
no,
our
favorite
thing
to
lawyers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
they
would
not
open-end
that
valuation
based
on
anything
that
will
let
the
man
qualify.
but
what
if
the
condition
is
that
he
would
qualify
as
long
as
he
provides
the
creditor
with
as
much
as
the
creditor
would
realize
if
the
creditor
foreclosed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
durkay,
can
i
interrupt,
just
to
be
sure?
i
may
not
understand
it
right.
but
i
thought
that
the...
to
the
extent
that
the
secured
creditor
does
not
realize
on
the
collateral,
he's
an
unsecured
creditor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
doesn't
he
get
the
same
participation
in
whatever
the
surplus
available
for
general
creditors
is
as
any
other
general
creditor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
has
the
same
motivation
as
the
general
creditors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
was
prompted
by
the
example
you
gave
earlier.
supposing
in
this
case,
just
as
the
bankruptcy
judge
was
about
to
rule,
the
creditor,
the
secured
creditor,
got
a
buyer,
somebody
who
was
interested
in
antique
kenworth
trucks
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
came
in
with
a
buyer,
who
made
him
a
40...
$48,000
offer,
higher
than
any
of
the
appraisals.
could
he
have
insisted
on
that
valuation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the...
if
the
creditor
could
establish
that
he
could
get
a
premium
value
for
the
truck,
and
if
he...
if
they
actually
repossessed
and
sold
it,
you'd
say
they'd
be
entitled
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
kennedy
gave,
where
you've
got
a
laundromat
and
the
forced
sale
would
be
almost
zero,
but
the
income-generating
value
of
the
property
would
be
significant,
that
there
you
would
use
some
kind
of
a...
a
cash
flow
valuation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
isn't
that
the
same
as
the
fair
market
value
of
this
truck,
as
appraised?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
is
it?
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
why
is
that
different
from
what
it
can
be
sold
for
if
you
have
fair
opportunity
to
offer
it
in
the
market?
why
is
there...
i...
i
must
confess,
i
should
have
asked
this
in
the
very
beginning...
but
why
is
the
fair
market
diff...
value...
different,
depending
on
whether
you're
the
buyer
or
the
seller?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
that...
that
assumption
means
if
you
keep
the
truck,
you
save
the
commission.
yeah.
so
that
would
be
the
cheaper
value.
