mr.
john
j.
durkay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
the
value
of
a
truck.
and
the
context
is
this:
instead
of
allowing
the
secured
creditor
to
take
back
the
truck
and
put
it
on
the
market
to
sell,
the
debtor
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
retain
the
truck
and
use
it
in
his
business.
if
i
can
make
one
comment,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
about
that
that
came
up
in
one
of
your
statements
of
concern
earlier.
remember,
the
secured...
the
debtor
is
not
just
going
to
retain
the
collateral.
he's
going
to
do
a
lot
more
than
that.
he's
going
to
be
required,
under
the
system
to
pay
interest.
he's
going
to
be
required
to
answer
to
the
strongest
collection
agent
in
the
country,
the
chapter
13
trustee.
the
minute
he's
late
there's
going
to
be
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
bankruptcy.
he's
got
to
maintain
full
insurance
at
all
times.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
the
secured
creditor
can
insist
that
that
depreciation
never
be
faster
than
the
amount
of
payments.
that's
not
506.
that's
362.
and
adequate
protection
would
apply
in
a
chapter
13
plan.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
this
was,
remember,
not
only
a
502
hearing,
but
it
was
also
a
motion
to
stay.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
finally,
of
course,
he
has
to
promise
to
preserve
and
maintain
the
collateral.
you
know,
your
point
is
well
taken
in
this
sense.
but,
remember,
nobody
knows
what
property
is
going
to
be
worth
in
the
future.
that's
part
of
what
we're
doing.
we're
trying
to
find
out.
now,
one
of
the
things
we
do
to
try
and
find
out
is
we
go
to
people
that
know.
i'd
like
to
raise
another
question,
i
think,
that's
been
raised
already
in
argument,
that
there
were
two
experts
here.
if
you
read
in
the
transcript
on
page
90,
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
the
bankruptcy
judge
said
there's
only
been
one
expert
in
this
case.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
whole
posturing
of
the
case
to
this
point
in
time,
from
the
point
of
view
of
understanding
where
it's
coming
from,
is
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
rashes
were
going
to
win
their
hearing
and
get
a
good
confirmal
plan,
mr.
baron
and
i
made
a
tactical
decision
that
we
weren't
going
to
come
in
and
try
to
prove
a
forced
sale
or
foreclosure
sale
or
any
of
that.
we
brought
an
appraiser
in,
who
testified
as
to
fair
market
value.
the
fair
market
value
of
this
truck
is
$31,875.
and
the
judge,
listening
to
the
testimony,
totally
rejected
the
so-called
testimony
of...
brought
by
the
associates.
the
witness
from
the
associates
had
never
seen
the
truck.
he
admitted
it.
he
didn't
even
know
what
color
it
was.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
that
truck.
well,
you
know,
the
uniform
standards
of
professional
appraiser
practice
is
a
guide
here.
it's--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--the
fifth
circuit
says
we
could
have.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
that's
their
opinion.
we
didn't--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--right.
and...
and
the
reason
was
tactical.
we
wanted
to
win.
we...
we
took
a...
we
gave
the
number,
31,875--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--no,
the
judge--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--no...
well,
it...
it's
at
least
foreclosure
value.
that
was
the
issue.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
i
think--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--i
think
what
506
says,
if
i
can
get
directly
to
that,
is
that
the
associates
is
entitled
to
be
as
well
off
as
if
they
had
taken
the
truck
back
and
sold
it.
they're
not
entitled
to
be
better
off.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
and
that's
the
argument
they
used
about
mr.
rash,
saying,
if
i
want
to
keep
the
truck,
the
truck
has
to
be
worth
more
value.
that...
that
truck
is
still
the
same
truck.
it
doesn't
increase
or
decrease
in
value
because
somebody
does
or
doesn't
want
to
retain
it
or
not
retain.
it's
the
same
truck.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
because
that
additional
money
isn't
just
being
generated
by
the
truck.
it's
also
being
generated
by
mr.
rash
driving
the
truck.
you
know,
i
heard
a--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
we...
we
guaranteed
to
them
in
the
process
that
they're
at
least
going
to
get
their
liquidation
value.
and
then
we
allow
them
to
participate
as
an
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
and
that's
a
fair
balancing.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
i
think,
in
the
bottom
line,
what
reorganization
is
all
about
is
trying
to
create
value,
as
opposed
to
chapter
7,
which
is
liquidation,
close
the
door,
let's
see
what
we've
got.
the
way
you
measure
whether
or
not
a
reorganization
is
a
good
reorganization
is
you
measure
it
against
the
standard
of
what
would
happen
in
a
7.
if
we're
going
to
have
a
7,
what
are
the
results?
that's
what
is
the
so-called
liquidation
analysis,
the
chapter
7
analysis.
all
right.
now,
if
its
reorganization
is
able
to
do
better
than
that,
okay,
it
probably
should
go
forward.
that's
the
goal,
to
do
better
than
the
straight
liquidation.
in
this
case,
there
are
a
lot
of
parties
that
are
then
going
to
look
to
that
additional
amount
of
money.
the
rashes
get
to
live
on
some
of
the
money
that
they
make,
within
the
bounds
of
the
disposable
income
test.
the
chapter
13
trustee
in
the
system
gets
some
compensation.
at
the
point
in
time
when
you
begin
to
distribute
this
extra
value,
this
extra
value
is
almost
totally
attributable
to
the
fact
that
an
individual
made
a
commitment
to
go
to
work
in
this
context,
in
this
system.
he
did
that
because
he
wanted
to
pay
his
bills.
that
should
be
shared
among
the
creditors
on
a
fair
basis.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
i
think
congress
said
this
is
how
it's
going
to
work.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
well,
i
guess
my
simple
answer,
justice
scalia,
is
i
don't...
i
understand
that,
but
i
don't
find
any...
anything
in
506
that
says
that
one
of
the
things
you
take
a
look
at
is
a...
a
premium
or
a
kicker
to
the
secured,
for
the
privilege
of
allowing
this
to
happen.
the
secured
has
to
allow
it
to
happen.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
exactly.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
and...
and
this
creditor
did
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
better
than
if
they
had
taken
the
truck
and
sold
it.
i
mean
that's...
that's
the
fair
principle.
let...
let
me
advance
this
one
step
further,
in
connection
with
the
split--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--it
doesn't
have
a
preference,
but
it
has
its
own
source
of
payment
stream.
it
has
the
payment
to--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--i
guess--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--as
a
creditor,
they
are
treated
better.
their
collateral
isn't
treated
better.
they
get
the
same
good
deal
that
any
unsecured
creditor
gets
to
participate
in
the
fruits
of
the
successful
reorganization.
and,
frankly,
a
secured
creditor's
incentive
is
exactly
that.
now,
a
secured
creditor
can
still
say,
even
though
i
made
$2,000
more,
i
don't
want
to
do
this,
because
i
don't
want
to
have
to
fool
with
this,
among
all
these
cases.
but
that's
what
congress
said,
no,
you
do
have
to.
that's
the
difference--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
well,
in...
in
the
case
you
give,
again,
if
the
laundromat
operates,
it's
going
to
raise
revenue
for
the...
the
secureds,
generally,
including
the
unsecured.
that's
why,
really,
part
of
the
scheme
is
the
bifurcation
of
claim.
the
secured
creditor
comes
in,
it's
undersecured,
and
they
get
two
claims.
they
have
the
status
as
secured
creditor...
that's
defined
one
way...
then--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--correct.
let
me...
let
me
address
that
issue
specifically,
and
justice
breyer's
comments
about
the
discretion
of
the
bankruptcy
judge.
there
are
three
key
words
in
506
that
you
can't
lose
sight
of.
those
three
key
words
are
"in
light
of".
what
506
requires
the...
the
judge
to
do
is
to
put
the
valuation
in
a
context.
it
used
to
be...
this
was
a
very
common
practice
in
the
southern
district...
when
you
first
file
a
bankruptcy,
you'd
go
in
and
you'd
value
everything,
sight
unseen,
to
see
what
kind
of
hand
you
got
dealt.
then
you'd
start
to
work
your
reorganization
theory
based
on
the
fixed
values
that
were
set
down.
that's
not
how
you
do
it.
what
506
says,
when
you
conduct
a
valuation,
put
it
in
context.
why
are
you
getting
this
valuation?
what
do
you
plan
to
do
with
the
property?
what
are
you
contemplating?
what
are
the
res
judicata
effects?
what
are
the
collateral
estoppel
effects?
what's
this
going
to
mean
in
the
real
world
of
this
bankruptcy?
but
it
says
"in
light
of".
it
says
put
it
in
a
context.
there's
no
mandatory
language
there.
there's...
the
judge
has...
has
eminent
discretion
in
connection
with
this
factfinding
process
to
come
up
with
what
you're
really
asking
him
to
do,
which
is
the
common
sense
answer,
in
context.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
no.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
yeah.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
absolutely.
and
he...
one
of
the
things
he
would
do
is
he'd
make
sure
that
those
witnesses,
those
appraisers,
knew
why
the
valuation
was
being
conducted--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--what
was
the
hearing
all
about.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
absolutely.
justice
rehnquist,
the
formulation
i
propose,
which
is
the
net
proceeds
to
the
secured
creditor
on
repossession
and
liquidation
of
collateral,
doesn't
require
that
you
have
to
consider
a
forced
sale.
i...
i
don't
see
why
you
can't
allow
the
secured
creditor
the
luxury
of
coming
in
and
saying,
i
would
do
better
than
that.
in
fact,
at
the
trial,
that
was
exactly
the
associates'
position.
they
said,
you
shouldn't
hang
us
with
wholesale
because
we
can
get
retail
when
we
sell
our
collateral.
the
only
problem
was
their
witness
said
they
couldn't.
he
said
he
saw
15
sales
and
nobody
showed
up
at
12
at...
of
them
and
he
just
said
that
was
company
policy.
a
secured
creditor
ought
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
say,
if
i
hold
this
property.
in
fact,
there's
a
very
simple
way
to
do
this.
i
mean
what
the
secured
creditor
does
is
he
comes
in
with
a
buyer
with
a
commitment.
that's
good...
that's
how
a
trustee
would
do
it.
he
wouldn't
say,
i
think
it's
worth
this,
i
think
it's
worth
that.
he'd
go
find
a
buyer
that's
willing
to
sign
up
to
that.
to...
to
take
a
good
example...
and
the
reason
why
the
united
states
is
here...
and
there's
some
real
problems,
i
think,
with
the
presence
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
and
the
posture
they're
taking.
of
course,
they're
here
because
of
the
taffi
case.
the
taffi
case--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--the
taffi
case.
in...
in
the
taffi
case,
in
re
taffi,
which
is
the
ninth
circuit
case
that...
that
has
come
here
in
connection
with
this,
there
was
a
stipulation
presented
that
the
home
had
a
fair
market
value
of
300
and
a
forced
sale
value
of
250.
and
the...
and
the
first
and
second
liens
were
233,000,
and
the
question
then
was,
what
was
the
value
of
the
irs
claim.
well,
in
the
first
place,
as
a
practical
matter,
you're
not
going
to
find
an
appraiser...
you're
not
going
to
find
an
appraiser
willing,
to
give
any
value
to
that
third
lien.
that's
so
far
back
in
the
train,
that
caboose
just
doesn't
have
value.
to
give,
in
the
stipulation,
any
value
at
all
to
the
irs
was
very
generous.
but,
secondly,
and
more
importantly,
in
the
real
world
of
bankruptcy,
the
general
way
that
would
be
handled
is
if
you're
a
third
lien
and
you
really
think
there
is
equity
in
that
collateral,
you
write
a
check
to
the
first
and
second
and
take
the
first
position.
this
isn't
a...
a
formula
or
a
mathematics.
this
is
real
business
in
the
real
world.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
justice
breyer,
otherwise
what
you
do
is
you
create
a
waste.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
if
you
hypothesize
an
asset,
that's
the
extra
value
from
reorganizing.
and
under
the
petitioner's
theory,
you
have
to
give
that
extra
value
to
the
petitioner,
which
means
the
13
never
happens,
which
means
that
value--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
no,
i...
i
totally
agree
with--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--if--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--justice
scalia,
i
totally
agree
with
you
in
the
way
you
frame
your
hypothetical.
what
puzzles
me
is
what
you've
said
is
what
i've
said
all
along,
which
is
the
only
reason
that
the
associates
wants
this
extra
value
is
to
have
leverage
and
power
in
the
transaction.
and
the
one
thing
the
united
states
congress
said
was,
we're
not
going
to
play
a
power
game.
the
bankruptcy
court
is
going
to
hand
out
assets
fairly.
and
we're
not
going
to
accommodate
the
leverage,
the
power,
the
authority,
or
the
transaction.
that's
gone.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
that
isn't
value
in
an
appraisal
sense.
that's
power
and
it's
leverage.
right
off
the
bat,
when
a
bankruptcy
is
filed,
that
secured
creditor
is
told,
hands
off,
you're
stayed.
that
power
and
leverage
is
gone
until
the
court
says
otherwise.
and
as
long
as
you
can
extract
the
economic
value
of
your
loss,
your
depreciation,
over
time,
adequate
protection,
that
stay
is
going
to
stay
in
effect.
this
is
a...
this
is
a
debtor
remedial
statute.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
oh,
if
he
brought
that
evidence
before
the
judge,
i
think
a
judge
would
be
hard
pressed
not
to
give
that
evidence...
hard,
fast,
factual
evidence...
full
value.
you
know,
really,
what
we're
talking
about--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--if
you
want
to
take
that
position,
you
better
bring
in
some
good
evidence,
though.
that's
the...
that's
the
only
point.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
now--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--it
flips
the
other
way
around.
suppose
you've
got
a...
a
pharmacy
and
they're...
they're
going
to
be
delivering
pharmaceuticals.
and
the
owner
of
the
pharmacy
insists
on
using
a
1954
antique
mustang
instead
of
a
hyundai.
and...
and
he
says,
well,
according
to
the
standard
advanced
by
the
associates,
i'm
entitled
to
value
that
collateral
at
what
it
would
cost
me
to
replace
that
car,
which
is
a
hyundai.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
a
'54
mustang
is
worth
real
money.
a
judge
is
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
that.
now,
this
isn't
mechanical.
i
mean
it's--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--sorry,
justice.
[laughter]
well,
justice
rehnquist,
now
you
have
to
admit,
under
those
circumstances,
that
'54
mustang
is
now
mighty
valuable.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
the
strong
position
i
took
with
the
fifth
circuit
that's
embodied
in
the
king
opinion
is
that
it
is
a
genuine
non
sequitur
to
say
that
simply
because
the
debtor
proposes
to
retain
the
value...
the
property...
in
and
of
itself,
it
suddenly
has
an
inherently
enhanced
value.
you
have
to
think
about
those
issues,
but
it
doesn't
automatically
follow
that
that
means
that
number
changes.
but
let...
let
me
add
this
point
if
i
can.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
yes.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
in
this--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--in
connection
with
a
1989
kenworth
in
a
chapter
13,
those
words
may
not
give
you
a
lot
of
answers.
in
some
bankruptcies
involving
some
kinds
of
properties
and
some
kinds
of
proceedings,
they
may
be
totally
dispositive
of
the
issue.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
the
trustee
comes
in
and
says,
i
want
to
sell
the
kenworth.
it's
a
chapter
7
now.
and
the
reason
i
want
to
sell
it
is
i
think
i
can
get
$50,000
for
it
at
auction.
and
that's
equity
above
and
beyond
what
the
associates
claims
their
first
lien
is.
and
for
my
first
witness
i'm
going
to
call
a
fellow
and
he's
going
to
come
in
and
he's
going
to
give
an
income
valuation
of
that
truck
that
says
it's
worth
$50,000.
the
judge
would
say,
wait
a
minute,
you're
proposing
to
auction
this
property.
what
are
you
going
to
get
at
auction?
i
don't
want
to
hear
about
what
somebody
says
it's
worth
on
an
income
approach.
you're
saying,
i'm
going
to
auction
it;
what's
the
auction
value?
that's
the
proposed
user
disposition.
and
under
those
circumstances,
that
language
gives
you
a
little
bit
of
information.
remember
how
much
ground
506
has
to
cover.
i
mean
it
has
to
cover
every
imaginable
type
of
property
and
every
proceeding
and
bankruptcy,
and
that's
a
lot
of
ground.
you
know,
if
you
read
506,
and
you
sit
it
next
to
the
canons
of
ethics
of
the
uniform
standards
of
professional
appraisal
practice
that
tell
you
what
an
appraiser
needs
to
know
before
conducting
an
appraisal,
the
language
is
remarkably
similar.
it's
remarkably
similar.
what
both
are
saying
is,
do
this
in
the
real
world,
in
context.
no
hypotheticals,
no
theoreticals.
let
the
appraisers
know
everything
there
is
to
know.
give
accurate,
honest
answers.
judge,
take
all
the
proper
context
into
consideration
before
you
make
your
determination.
don't
do
any
blind
appraisals.
and
if
you
do
that,
and
when
you
do
that,
we
will
generally
leave
that
alone.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
you
might
be
able
to
do
that.
correct.
if...
if
an
appraiser
were
able
to
provide
that
kind
of
analysis,
that
may
well
be
acceptable.
but
under
this
scenario--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--if
i
can--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--well,
because
in
the
scenario
that
justice
kennedy
gave,
what
could
happen
is
that
secured
creditor
could
find
somebody
to
come
in
and
buy
the
laundromat,
lock,
stock
and
barrel...
buy
the
business.
and
he
would
get
the
cash
flow.
he'd
come
in
and
start
operating
it.
i
mean
you're
going
to
have
to
have
some
good
evidence
on
this,
but
that's
at
least
theoretically
possible.
in
the
case
of
a
truck,
there's
no
going-concern
value
for
a
truck.
the
truck
is
a
truck
is
a
truck.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
yes.
i
can't
say
it's
the
only...
but,
yes.
i
mean
that's
really
the
likely
alternative
scenario.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
some...
somebody
would
come
in
and
buy
the
laundromat.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
and
the
secured
creditor
gets
all
the
cash
flow
from
the
operation
of
the
laundromat,
because
he's
probably
the
major
unsecured.
remember,
he's
got
that
backup
position.
now,
one
thing,
also,
to
do
with
506
that
i
think
is
important,
don't
use
506
to
judge
the
quality
of
the
bankruptcy.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
provisions
in
the
bankruptcy
code
the
judge
can
use,
such
as
the
good-faith
provisions,
the
liquidation
analysis,
et
cetera,
that
are
going
to
make
sure
that
these
are
good
bankruptcies,
that
they're
not
bad
deals,
they're
not
bad
outcomes.
they
don't
really
harm
creditors
unnecessarily.
506
is
one
component.
if
you
get
a
scenario
that
says,
well,
i
really
don't
like
the
way
this
spins
down,
in
terms
of
what
the
bankruptcy
looks
like...
i
mean
remember
that
you've
got
a
common
sense
judge
watching
that
and
saying,
well,
that
still
doesn't
mean
you're
going
to
get
your
bankruptcy.
even
if
you
get
your
506
evidence
proved,
you
don't
automatically
have
a
confirmation
of
your
plan.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
1325(b)
and
(c)
handle
the
dynamics
of
the
bankruptcy.
they
don't
really
answer
the
question
of
what
the
property
is
worth.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
in
order
to--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
the
simple
formula
i
used
here
is
i
just
don't
think
you
can
say
that
when
mr.
rash
told
the
associates
he
wanted
to
keep
the
truck,
poof,
it
was
suddenly
now
more
valuable.
i...
i
just
think
it's
as
simple
at
that.
it's
the
same
truck.
you
know,
the
comment
that
was
made
in
en
banc
was,
well,
what
about
the
going-concern
value?
trucks
don't
have
going-concern
value.
the...
trucks
have
a
ready
market.
you
know
what
they're
worth.
you
can
find
the
market.
it's
very
easy
to
determine
what
that
truck
is
worth,
what
it
can
be
bought
and
sold
for.
you
know,
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
in
discussing
bfp
and
this
issue,
they
toggle
back
and
forth...
here...
what
i'm
talking
about
is...
is
page
14,
15
and
16.
they
say
that
the
value
should
be
based
on
what
the
debtor
would
have
to
pay...
quoting
bfp...
which
is
if
offered
for
sale.
then
they
say
at
the
top
of
15
that
it
has
to
be
sold
within
the
time
and
manner.
then
they
go
on
down
and
say,
to
determine
the
price
it's
paid
for.
in
other
words,
they're
toggling
back
and
forth
between
paid
and...
and
bought.
get
on...
get
in
the
boat
or
get
on
the
shore.
i
mean
you
can't
flip
back
and
forth
between
what
the
buy
price
is
and
what
the
sale
price
is
in
the
retail
context.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
correct.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
he...
he
wasn't
renting
his
truck
on
a
long-term
basis.
every
day
he
showed
up
and
hauled,
he
got
paid.
if
he
didn't,
he
didn't.
and
a
part
of
that
activity--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--it
wasn't--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--no,
you
would.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
no.
you...
you
would
get--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--you
would
get
the
lane
deal.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
you
would
get
the
lane
deal.
if
you
showed
up
at
lane,
you
would
be
able
to
haul
for
lane
on
the
same
basis
as
mr.
rash.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
if
you
can
drive--
mr.
john
j.
durkay
--but,
see,
that's
the
point.
the
value
here
is
two
components.
there's
the
truck
and
there's
the
truck
driver.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
no,
the
truck
driver
wasn't
pledged
to
the
associates.
[laughter]
that's...
that's
a
13th
amendment
problem.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
durkay
thank
you,
sir.
