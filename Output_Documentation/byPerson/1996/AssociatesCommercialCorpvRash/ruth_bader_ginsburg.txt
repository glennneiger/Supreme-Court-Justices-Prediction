mr.
phillips,
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
about
the
fifth
circuit,
because
i
thought
that
the
main
point
for
judge
king
was
based
on
the
federal
statute
as
much...
well,
more
than
the
state
law
point
that
you
were
about
to
deal
with.
she
looked
to
1325,
and
she
said,
now
there
are
two
things
the
debtor
can
do
in
this
situation.
and
one
is
surrender
the
collateral.
give
it
back
to
the
creditor.
and
then
it
would
have
what's
been
called
wholesale
value.
the
other
thing
is
leave
it
with
the
debtor
and
value
it.
the
question
that
she
put
was,
why
should
there
be
different
results
whether
which
of
those
two
routes
the
creditor
who
doesn't
want
to
go
along
with
the
reorganization...
which...
which
route
that
is...
is
picked
by
the
debtor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
the
question
was
putting...
what...
what
rationale
would
the
legislature
have
for
having
two
different...
one
much
more
favorable
to
the
secured
creditor?
and
i
thought
that
that
was
the
point.
wouldn't
one
logically
expect,
in
the
balance
between
the
secured
and
unsecured,
either
of
those
routes
to
yield
the
same
end
result?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kent,
could
you...
could
you
explain
to
me,
then,
what
judge
easterbrook
meant,
because
you
just
made
this
common
sense
proposition.
this
is
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert
at
30-31...
it's
something
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
rely
on...
that
there
was
no
real
difference
between
these
two
values
when
you
take
out
of
the
so-called
retail
value
the
things
that
don't
relate
to
the
object
itself.

justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
durkay,
could
you
explain
to
me,
since
you
put
it
to
judge
king,
why
she
thought
that
it
was
irrational
to
make
a
distinction
about
the
result
that
you
get...
now,
looking
to
1325...
whether
you
use
(b)
or
(c)...
that
the
value
should
be
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
it
would
be
an
unseemly
difference
to
have,
when
the
debtor
surrenders
the
property,
one
value--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
when
the...
the
debtor
keeps
the
property,
a
much
higher
value.
