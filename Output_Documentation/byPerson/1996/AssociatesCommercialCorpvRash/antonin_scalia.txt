justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
you...
you
don't
agree
that...
that
a
secured
interest
is
not
a
secured
interest
if...
if
its
existence
would
prevent
chapter
13?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
sounds
reasonable
to
me,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
let
me
ask,
while
i
do
not
agree
with
justice
breyer's
suggestion
that
the
valuation
should
be
whatever
it
takes
to
enable
the
13
to
proceed,
there
is
some
textual
basis
for...
for
saying
that.
what
meaning
do
you
give
to
the...
to
the
other
portion?
you
say
both
parties
agree
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
valuation
was.
but...
but
what...
what
is
the
meaning
of
that:
such
value
shall
be
determined...
we're
discussing
here...
in
light
of
the
proposed
disposition
or
use?
but
it
also
says:
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
valuation.
what...
what
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
a
lot
of
different
purposes.
why
would
its
valuation
be
different
for
one
purpose
rather
than
another?
i'm
not
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
an
example
of...
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
which
the
purpose
would...
would...
would
produce
a
different
valuation.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why...
why
should
that
affect
the
valuation
you
give?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
and
what...
do
you
have
any
notion
as
to
what
the
other
thing,
in...
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
valuation...
do
you
have
any
notion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
why
would
you
give
it
a
different
valuation
for
that
purpose
than
you
would
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
were
about
to.
[laughter]
somebody
interrupted
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it...
it
sets
up
a...
a
queer
scheme
for...
for
chapter
13.
you...
you...
you're
telling
the
unsecured
creditors...
you...
you
don't...
you
don't
tell
them,
you're
not
going
to
get
any
more
out
of
chapter
13
than
what
you
get
if
you...
if
you
demanded
all
of
your
money
right
now.
we're
going
to
give
you
an
incentive
to
let
the
guy
continue
to
do
business.
you...
you
may
get
more.
but
you're
not
telling
that
to
the
secured
creditors.
you're
insisting
that
the
court-secured
creditors
get
nothing
more,
as
secured
creditors,
than
they
would
have
gotten
by
foreclosing
immediately
and
taking
the
truck
away.
leaving
them
no
incentive,
no
benefit
from
the
chapter
13,
although
you
give
the
benefit
to
the
unsecured
creditors.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
don't
say
that
to
the
unsecured
creditors.
you
don't
tell
them,
you're
not
going
to
get
any
more
out
of
this
than
what...
what
you
would
have
gotten
if
you...
if
you
closed
down
the
business
today.
why
should
you...
why
should
you
say
that
to
the
secured
creditor?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
is
the
unsecured
creditors'
additional
income
that
they...
that
they
derive
from
letting
this
person
stay
in
business.
and
you
say,
you
know,
that's
the
deal,
by
letting
him
stay
in
business,
you
get
more
than
you
otherwise
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
it.
now,
why
do
you
give
that
incentive
to
the
unsecured
creditors
but
not
give
it
to
the
secured
creditor?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
seem
to
me
congress
wants
to
preserve
the
security
and...
and
wanted
to
give
the
secured
creditor
a
benefit
in
chapter
13,
just
as
it
gives
to
unsecured
creditors
a
benefit.
but
you're
not
giving
him
any...
any
benefit
as
a
secured
creditor.
you're...
you're
treating
him
as
though
the
whole
thing
came
to
an
end,
then,
although...
although
you
don't
treat
the
unsecured
creditors
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
see,
that's
why
i
say,
at
that
part...
at
that
part,
if
it's
a
question
between
you
and
the...
you
and
the
creditor.
that's
a
different
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
say...
they
say
they're
not
going
to
let
the...
they're
not
going
to
let
the...
the
secured
party
prevent
the
chapter
13.
but
it...
it's
the
whole
purpose
of...
of
this
discussion
to...
to
determine
whether
they
have
said,
we're
going
to,
moreover,
deprive
the...
the
secured
creditor
of...
of
the
value
that
he
has
of...
of
keeping
the
business
a
going
concern,
so
that
he
can
get
his
money
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
durkay,
what
is
your
explanation...
i
think
this...
to
my
mind,
the
strongest
argument
for
petitioners
here
is...
is
the
language
"in
light
of
the
proposed
disposition
or
use
of
such
property.
"
what
is
your
explanation
of
that
language?
if
it
does
not
mean
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
property
is
going
to
be
continued
to
be
used
in
this
case
by
the
debtor
and
therefore
has
a
going...
a
going
concern
value?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
wait.
that
isn't
the
question
i
asked.
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
you're...
you're
arguing
it
on
the
merit.
what
is
your...
what
is
your...
you
say
it
doesn't
mean
that...
that
language
doesn't
mean
that.
what
does
it
mean,
"in
light
of
the
proposed
disposition
or
use?
"
what
does
it
refer
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
doesn't
refer
to
precisely
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not
here?
if
there,
why
not
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
only...
the
only
situation
in
which
you
would...
you
would
answer
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
by
saying,
we
would
give
it
going-concern
value...
only
if
you
could
show
that...
that
he
could
sell
it
to
somebody
else...
the
whole
concern?
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
he's
willing
to
stay
there
and
operate
it
himself,
but
there's
nobody
else
in
this
little
town
willing
to
buy
it,
then
all
the
secured
creditor
gets
is
the
scrap
value
of
these
machines?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
"proposed
use"
doesn't
really
lead
you
to
"retail
value"
necessarily.
i
mean
i...
i
can
see
how
it
doesn't
lead
you
to
"wholesale
value",
but
why
does
it
lead
you
to
"retail
value"?
