chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
96-454,
associates
commercial
corporation
v.
elray
rash.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
speak
until
you
get
outside
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
also
relevant,
mr.
phillips,
that...
and...
the
chapter
13
proposal
was
not
that
your
client
get
the
security
back
at
whatever
value,
but
that
the
security
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
debtor
and
continue
to
depreciate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
here--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--here
you
don't...
you
don't
get
to
have
your
security
back.
it's
still
in
the
hands
of
the
debtor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
all
you're
getting
is...
is
periodic
payments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
always
going
to
have
a
possible
difference
in
valuation.
if
you
simply
take
something
out
and
sell
it
at
forced
sale
as
opposed
to,
say,
renting
it
for
a
couple
of
years
and...
with
an
assured
tenant,
there
is
going
to
be
a
difference
in
valuation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
durkay,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
does
run
the
risk
of
seeing
the
collateral
depreciate
in
value
very
sharply,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yeah,
but
none
of
the
parties
can
fully
anticipate
what
the
bluebook
on
this
particular
truck
is
going
to
say
5
years
from
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
never
seen
any
truck
or
he
hadn't
seen
this
truck?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the...
the
judge
surely
doesn't
just
pick
a
number
out
of
the
air.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
he
listen
to
witnesses
as
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--let's...
supposing
this...
this
weren't
a
truck,
which
is
perhaps
something
we
all
figure
we
might
have
an
idea
of
what
it's
worth.
suppose
it's
a
big
apartment
building
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
judge
would
listen
to
witnesses,
would
he
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
don't
you
think
all
of
the
appraisers
would
agree
that
if
there
had
to
be
a
forced
sale
in
30
days,
the
value
would
be
less
than
if
they
were
allowed
a
year
to
find
a
buyer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the...
the
what
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--they
didn't
make
mustangs
till
'63.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
durkay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
