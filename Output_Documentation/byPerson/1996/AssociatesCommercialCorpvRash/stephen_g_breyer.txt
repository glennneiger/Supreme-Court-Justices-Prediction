justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
cut
back
the
value
in
order
to
make
certain
he
gets
into
the
reorganization,
he
puts
in
his
disposable
income
that
you
get
the
amount
insofar
as
it's
in
dispute
between
the
creditors.
now,
that
kind
of
result
seems
fair.
and
it
would
be
very
case
specific.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
could
the...
the
value
for
purposes
of
a
chapter
13
reorganization,
insofar
as
that
exceeds
what
your
client
would
get
in
a
liquidation,
couldn't...
it's
nonexistent
if
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
chapter
13
reorganization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is
it
possible
that...
accepting
for
argument's
sake
all
your
arguments...
that
it's
better
to
give
this
money
to
the
secured
creditor,
basically,
than
the
unsecured?
still,
doesn't
what
he's
argued
in
his
red
brief
at
least
set
a
ceiling
on
what
you
can...
i
mean,
in
other
words,
if
it's
impossible
for
the
person
to
go
into
reorganization--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unless
you
lop
off
some
of
this
surplus...
well,
then,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
value
the
secured
interest
at
an
amount
that
includes
what
we've
just
seen
is
lopped
off?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
said,
i
think,
that
he
couldn't
qualify
if
he
had
to...
if
he
had
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
far
as
it's
more
than
that...
let's
suppose
it's...
suppose,
in
the
hands
of
your
client,
this
is
going
to
earn
enough
money
so
that
he
has
plenty
of
money
to...
to
pay
what
he
owes,
or
much
of
it,
why
should
the
extra
amount,
up
to
the
retail
value
or
the
replacement
value,
go
to
unsecured
creditors
rather
than
the
person
who
had
the
foresight
to
take
a
secured
interest
in
the
truck?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
part
that's
worrying
me
the
most.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they're...
if
they
took
the
truck
back,
it
just
says
that's
one
of
their
options...
c,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
might
use
it
themselves.
they
might
look
around
for
a
long
time.
they
might...
who
knows
what
they
might
do.
and
these
things
are
always...
all
we
know
is
they
want
to
take
it
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
if
they
want
to
take
it
back,
they
must
think
they're
better
off.
and...
otherwise
they
wouldn't
want
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
get
sidetracked.
because
my
question
really
was,
why
not...
why
not
give
the
extra
amount,
above
the
31...
suppose
it
turns
out
to
be
38
or
whatever
it
is...
why
shouldn't
that
go
to
the
truck
owner
rather
than
the
unsecured
creditors?
i
understand
that
maybe
your
client
should
be...
shouldn't...
if
the
money
isn't
there
for
him
to
go
into
13,
that
seems
like
a
separate
argument.
but
the
unsecured
versus
the
secured?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in...
in
that
context,
assuming,
which
i
do
think
this
statute
is
really
opaque
on
this
question,
you
can
make
excellent
arguments
on
both
sides.
so...
so
if
you
think
what
justice
kennedy
said,
which
is
that
in
many
businesses,
perhaps
small
businesses,
the
creditor
doesn't
really
expect
to
repossess
and
sell?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he...
this
repossession
is
a
threat?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
he
wants
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's...
that's
the
whole
thing.
you're
going
to
lose
your
refrigerator
or
whatever.
that's
a
threat.
it's
not
because
it...
so...
so
if
that's
what...
how
he's
thinking,
then
i
come
back
to
the
possible
interpretation
that...
that
he
should
be
able
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
debtor
if
there
is
the
money
to
be
gotten
and
it
would
otherwise
go
to
a
different
creditor.
that's
where
i
keep
coming
up
against...
i
don't
know
why...
what
would
be
wrong
with
that
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
the
waste?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
that's
why
i
raise
what
may
be
the
dead
horse,
but...
but
i
don't
want
to
keep
flogging
it,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that...
that
it
would
set
a
ceiling...
it
would
set
a
ceiling
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no...
you
know,
that
the
value
would
be
what
you
would
have
gotten
in
the
liquidation,
plus
any
amount
that
would
otherwise
go
to
the
unsecured
creditors,
up
to
the
retail
value.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
durkay,
that
in
agreeing
with
all
of
this,
you
understate
the
position
of
the...
of
the
secured
creditor.
it
isn't
just
that
he
has
the...
the
power
to
get
back
the
distress
value
of...
of
what
he's
able
to
yank,
but
he
is
able
to
say
to
the...
to
the
businessman,
you
pay
me
what
you
owe
me
or
i'm
going
to
close
your
business
down
by
taking
away
the
washing
machines
or
whatever
you
have
that's
essential
for
your
business.
so
the
businessman
says,
well,
i'll
pay
you
first,
because
you
can
close
me
down
entirely.
now,
you're
setting
up
a
chapter
13,
which
deprives
him
of
that
benefit
of
being
able
to
close
the...
the
business
down.
and
yet,
at
the
same
time,
you're
telling
this...
this
debtor
that
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
him
what
he
would
have
been
able
to...
to
extract
from
him
had
there
not
been
a
chapter
13.
