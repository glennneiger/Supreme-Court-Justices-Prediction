mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
value
of
collateral
that
a
chapter
13
debtor
proposes
to
retain
and
use
should
be
determined
by
what
the
secured
creditor
could
obtain
if
it
foreclosed
on
that
property
and
sold
it,
or
by
what
the
debtor
would
have
to
pay
in
order
to
acquire
a
comparable
property.
our
argument
is
that
section
506(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
declares
that
the
value
of
the
property
should
vary,
depending
on
whether
it
is
proposed
to
be
used
or
proposed
to
be
disposed
of,
and
that
a
hypothetical
disclosure
value
is
insufficient
and
ignores
the
language
of
the
statute.
accordingly,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
when
it
undervalued
the
secured
interest
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
this
is
a
chapter
13
case
in
which
the
respondents
proposed
a
plan
that
would
permit
them
to
keep
a
tractor
trailer
truck,
which
served
as
collateral
for
a
debt
owed
to
the
petitioner.
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy,
the
petitioner
was
owed
approximately...
well,
not
approximately...
was
owed
$41,171,
and
it
had
perfected
a
lien
on
the...
under
state
law.
petitioner
sought,
under
section
362,
to
lift
the
automatic
stay
and
to
repossess
the
truck.
respondents
objected,
sought
to
keep
the
truck
as
necessary
for
their
reorganization,
and
asked
the
court
to
value
the
truck
at
$28,500.
they
proposed
to
pay
that
amount,
plus
interest,
and
then
to
strip
the
lien
from
the...
from
the
petitioner.
both
sides
offered
expert
testimony
on
the
value
of
the
truck.
the
respondents'
expert
valued
it
at
retail,
at
$42,500.
our
expert
valued
it
at
$41,000.
and
the...
the
respondents'
expert
also
valued
it
at
wholesale,
at
$31,875,
which
he
got
to
by
discounting
by
25
percent
the
retail
value.
and
all
of
these
numbers
were
derived,
essentially,
from
standard
industry
bluebooks.
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
all
concluded
that,
under
these
circumstances,
they
had
to
decide
the
question
as
a
matter
of
law,
which
is
the
proper
method
of
valuation,
wholesale
or
retail.
in
doing
so,
they
quite
properly
turned
to
section
506(a)
of
the
code.
unfortunately,
they
misconstrued
that
provision.
506(a)
has
two
sentences.
the
first
sentence
tells
you
what
you
value.
and
as
this
court
held
in
timbers,
that
phrase
simply
tells
you
that
you
value
the
creditor's
collateral.
the
first
sentence
says
nothing
about
how
you
value
the
collateral.
the
second
sentence,
which
is
reproduced
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
says
that
the
way
you
value
collateral
is
that
you...
is
that
you
value...
shall
be
determined
in
light
of
the
proposed
disposition
or
use
of
such
property.
now,
the
court
is
fond
of
observing,
generally
speaking,
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
true.
you're
supposed
to
do
it
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
valuation
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
will
reread
it:
shall
be
determined
in
light
of
the
proposed
disposition
or
use
of
the
property.
suggesting,
as
we...
as
we
say--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
although
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties
about
the
purpose
of
the
valuation,
so
i...
i
skipped
over
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
purpose
of
the
valuation
here
was
to
decide
the
full
extent
of
our...
of
our
collateral,
for
purposes
of
deciding
how
much
money
should
be
paid
as
part
of...
as
part
of
the
chapter
13
reorganization.
and
there's
no
dispute
over
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
we
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
with
that,
because
that's
what
we
proposed
in
the
first
instance.
but
it's
not
at
all
clear,
and
it's
simply
speculation
as
to
whether
or
not
this
chapter
13
reorganization
would
have
succeeded
or
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
what
the
respondent
said
in
opposition
to
the
stay
in
the
bankruptcy
court
was
that
they
remain
on
the
hook
to
pay
back
associates
for
the
amount
of
money
that's
owed.
and
it's
approximately
$7,000...
is
the
difference
between
what
they
paid
and
what
we
think
they
should
have
paid.
so--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
appraiser
can...
ordinarily,
i
think
the
appraiser
would
take
into
consideration
what
is
on
the
truck.
i
mean
what
you're
being
asked
to
do
is
to
replace
the
truck
that
that
particular--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
then
the
appraiser
could...
could
adjust
it,
to
take
into
account
precisely
what's
on
the
truck.
just
as
if,
for
some
reason,
there
was
something
very
special
that
he
put
on
the
truck
that
he
paid
for
that
wasn't
part
of
the
secured
interest.
i
don't
think
that
we
would
get
the
higher
value
of
that,
as
we
say
in
the
brief.
you
know,
you
would
look
at
it
as
a
truck
to
replace,
essentially,
what
the
secured
interest
is,
what
is
the
collateral.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
there
was
money
paid
to
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
generally
speaking,
that
is
going
to
be
the
case.
is
this...
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
unsecureds
get
anything--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no,
that
kind
of
result
seems
to
undo
the
statute.
chapter
13
is
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--essentially,
a
right
that
all
debtors
have.
they
have
a
choice
between
chapter
7
and
chapter
13.
and
if
their
debts
are...
are
too
great
to
allow
them
to
reorganize
under
chapter
13,
then
they
have
to
put
up
with...
under...
with
chapter
7.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you...
you...
you
have
to
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
section
506(a)
says
look
at
the
proposed
disposition
or
the
proposed
use.
now,
if...
if
he
cannot
use
it
and
successfully
come
out
of
chapter
13,
then
he
is
required
to
go
under
chapter
7.
and
you
don't
avoid
the
chapter
7
problem
by--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--exactly.
exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's...
that's...
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and...
and
the
point
i
was
starting
to
move
toward,
which
is
the
rule
of
construction,
that
the
fifth
circuit
relied
upon
and
that
i
think,
really,
is
where
they
made
the
fundamental
error
in
this
case,
is
by
saying
that
the
state
law
rights
that
are
implicated
here
favor
requiring
us
to
show
by
clear
and
unambiguous
language
that
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
the
correct
one--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
one
is
that
the
language
suggests...
proposed
disposition
or
proposed
use...
which
suggests
that
there
are
different
methods
of
valuation.
and
second
of
all,
there's
no
reason
to
assume
equivalence
between
what
you
do
if
you
give
up
the
property
and
what
you
do
when
you
retain
the
property
and
use
it
as
part
of
a
successful
reorganization.
there's
clearly
a
difference
in
the
valuation.
both
parties
agree
on
that.
and
the
only
question
is
who
should
get
the
benefit
of
the
difference
in
the
valuation.
if
you
use
always
a
hypothetical
foreclosure
value,
then...
then...
then
there's...
you
never
have
any
advantages.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
again,
i
don't
think
so.
and
the
reason
is,
in
part,
the
congress
envisioned
that
there
would
be
negotiations
between
the
parties
on
these
kinds
of
issues.
and
you
can
only
negotiate
if
you
have
some
kind
of
differential
in
the
valuations.
and
if
you
use
the
same
hypothetical
foreclosure
valuation,
you'll
always
end
up
with
the
same
number.
which
means
there
is
no
basis
for
negotiation
between
the
debtor
and
the
creditor
in
any
particular
case.
and
it
seems
clearly...
and
there's
nothing
in
anything
that
supports
the
notion
that
going
along
on
the
disposed
use...
i
mean
going
along
with
the
proposed
use,
as
opposed
to
proposed
disposition,
is
meant
to
get
you
to
the
same
value.
it
doesn't.
the
assumption
is,
is
that
it
will
create
more
value,
because
it's
going
to
be
used.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yeah,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute,
because,
again,
the
statute
tells
you
to
look
at
the
proposed
use
or
proposed
disposition,
and...
and
judge
posner's
analysis
does
neither
of
those
things.
it
does
an
amalgam
of
the
two.
and
so,
therefore,
it
has
no
statutory
basis.
it's
much
like
the
rule
that
the
court
condemned
in
bfp,
the
70
percent
rule,
that
said
if
you
deviate
by
70
percent.
i
mean
it's
a
good
rule
and
it
might
make
good
policy
and
congress
might
want
to
adopt
it,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that...
that
remotely
supports
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'd
have
to
see
the
particular
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
there
are
two
very
distinct
appraisal
values
and
they
are
supported
by
solid
testimony,
it
seems
to
me
you'd
probably
be
obliged
to
take
one
rather
than
the
other,
rather
than
split
the
difference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
rule
that
out.
the
important
part
about
that,
though,
to
keep
in
mind
is,
is
that's
not
the
difference
between
the
hypothetical
foreclosure
value
and
the
use
value.
what
i'm
looking
at...
what
you're
talking
about
are
two
different
use
values
and
trying
to
resolve
those
by
splitting
the
difference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
are
lots
of
different
situations
which--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
depends
on--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
a
situation
where
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
my
guess
is
it
might
make
a
difference
whether
or
not
you
are
trying
to
decide
whether
the
outstanding
debt
puts
you
into
chapter
13
in
the
first
place,
because
there
are
limits
on
how
much
debt
you
can
carry
into
chapter
13.
so
you
might
value
that
differently.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
congress
had
made
clear...
and...
and
i'm
speculating
here,
because
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this...
but
if
congress
indicated
a
preference
at
the
edges
to
have
more
cases
into
chapter
13,
where
it's
close,
you
might,
under
those
circumstances,
attempt
to
value
the
outstanding
debt
in
a
way
that
would
make
it,
you
know,
less
in
order
to
bring
them
into
chapter
13.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not...
not
with
the
language
"proposed
disposition
or
use".
i
think
what
congress
has
clearly
indicated
is
that
if
you
have
a
proposed
use,
then
you
should
value
it
from
the
perspective
of
what
the
debtor
would
pay
in
order
to
be
able
to
acquire
that
exact
same
property
and
to
use
it.
and...
and
i
think
it's
important...
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
rule
of
construction,
because
i
think
it's
vital
to
the...
the
proper
outcome
of
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
here
where
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
problem
is...
is
that
your
rights
under
state
law
are
measured
by
foreclosure
value.
now,
our
rights
are
not
measured
by
the
foreclosure
value.
our
rights
are
measured
by
the
lien.
and
the
lien,
it
protects
us
all
the
way
through
to
the
actual
payment.
it's
supposed
to
protect
the
stream
of
payments.
that's
the
vital
element
of
what
our
state
rights
are.
and
to
come
in
here--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
i
mean
it
is
true
that
you
have
a
remedy
to
sell
the
collateral,
but
that's
not
the
end
of
your
right.
you're
still
entitled
to
a
judgment
for
the
amount
of
the
debt
that's
outstanding.
and
that's
how
your
state
law
right
is
defined.
and
that
really
is
the
mistake
that
the
court
of
appeals
made.
we
have
a
much
broader
state
law
right,
which
ought
to
be
valued
here.
and
this
court
said
both
radford
and
in--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
no.
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
i'd
still
be
entitled
to
the
difference
between
what
the...
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
under
amount
and
the
amount
of
the
actual
debt.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
understand
that.
but
we're
not...
we're
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
we're
not
distributing
it
under
those
circumstances.
that's
the
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
--but
that's
if
i'm
in
bankruptcy.
under
state
law,
i'd...
i'd
foreclose
and
i'd
go
and
ask
him--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--ask
him
for
the
extra
money--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
i'd
go
against
the
other
assets.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
court
said
in
radford.
you
don't
expect
congress
to
do...
unless
it
does
it
expressly.
and
congress
clearly
didn't
do
it
expressly
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
to
the
difference,
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'll
try
to
be
short
or
briefer
than
that.
i
think,
ultimately,
the
case
could
be
disposed
of
based
on,
essentially,
justice
scalia's
question,
which
is,
you
have
language
that
says
"proposed
disposition
or
proposed
use".
and
we...
every
example
he
gave
talked
about
auctions,
talked
about
sales.
he's
got
lots
of
use
for
the
language
506(a).
and...
and,
in
fact,
if
you
look
in
his
brief,
he
doesn't
offer
up
an
explanation
of
what
that
language
is
designed
to
mean.
and
the
only
brief
on
their
side
is
the
one
amicus
brief
says
that
12
proceeding.
and
it's
reasonably
clear
to
me
that,
to
have
to
stretch
that
far
to
find
some
meaning
in
this
particular
language,
tells
you
that
their
interpretation
really
eliminates
the
"proposed
use"
term.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
what...
what
it
leads
you
to,
ultimately...
and
the
value
we're
looking
for
and
the
rule
we
ask
for
is
what
it
would
cost
the
debtor
to
purchase
the
same
property
in
the
open
market.
and
that's
the
fair
market
value.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it...
it
is.
it's
the...
i
mean
if
he
had
to
go
out
and
buy
this
truck
today,
it
would
have
cost
him
either
41,000
or--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
of
the
differences
of
what
you
can
get
for
it.
i
mean
i
realize
that's
tautological,
but
i
mean--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
the
market
that...
that
determines
it.
