justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
on
this
preliminary
point,
there
was
some
payment
to
be
made
to
the
unsecured
creditors
i
think
a
few
years
down
the
line,
was
there
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so...
so
if
the
replacement
value
had
been
granted,
maybe
this
is
just
a
question
between
the
secured
and
unsecured
creditors,
not
between
the
debtor
and
the
secured
creditors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then--
--sorry.
no,
that's
okay.
were
you
finished?
or
if
it
would
be
the
case,
and
i
think
it
would
be.
the
words
"wholesale"
and
"retail"
don't
appear
in
this
statute.
so
i
take
it
congress
wanted
to
leave
it
up
to
the
bankruptcy
judge,
pretty
much.
and
why
wouldn't
the
bankruptcy
judge
be
sensible
in
saying,
well,
the
value
includes
whatever
will
be
disputed
between
the
unsecured
and
secured
creditors?
but,
as
in
this
case,
if
you
value
it
at
41,000,
and
then
he
can't
even
go
into
the...
chapter
13
because
he
just
doesn't
have
that
money,
that
couldn't
possibly
be
the
value.
there's
no
theory
on
which
that
would
be
the
value,
because
if
you
value
it
at
that,
there
won't
be
a
chapter
13
reorganization.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
that
is
your...
your
theory,
if
we
adopt
that
theory,
then
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
a
violation
of
the
statute
for
a
judge...
a
bankruptcy
judge
to
adopt
judge
posner's
solution,
which
is
just
split
the
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you're
indicating
by
your
tactical...
your
strategic
decision
that
you
made
that
you
could
have
asked
for
foreclosure
value?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you
didn't...
in
other
words,
you
didn't
even
try
that
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
trial
court.
that
would
have
been
your
right
under
this
theory
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
was
it...
was
it
error,
then,
for
the
judge
to
find
the
value
that
he
did?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
your
view
of
the
case,
he
should
have
said,
no,
no,
it's
foreclosure
value.
