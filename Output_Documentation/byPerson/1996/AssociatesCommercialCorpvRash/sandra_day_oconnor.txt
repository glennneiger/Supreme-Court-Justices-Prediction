now,
i
suppose,
if
the
higher
value
had
been
placed
on
it,
that
the
reorganization
might
not
have
occurred...
at
least
that's
what
respondents
say.
they
couldn't
have
made
the
payments.
and
then
your
client
would
have
had
to
take
a
truck
back
and
sell
it,
presumably
at
wholesale
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
any
event,
the
thing
proceeded,
and
respondents
made
payments
for
5
years,
and
presumably
have
completed
this
thing.
now,
if
you
prevail,
what's
going
to
happen
on
remand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there
are
no
warranties,
i
guess,
left
on
the
truck
as
far
as
the
debtor
is
concerned
at
this
point...
i
mean
at
the
point
they
kept
the
truck.
does
that
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
setting
a
value?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
and
it
might...
it
might
not
be
straight
blue
book
wholesale
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
in
a
sense,
the
security
owner
ought
to
be
able
to
get
the
same
amount
of
money,
if...
if
it
took
its
time
and
sold
the
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
theory--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
a
practical
matter,
it
seems
to
me
they
might
be
pretty
close
together.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
difference
might
be
what
you
have
to
pay
somebody,
by
way
of
a
commission,
to
sell
it
for
you.
i
mean
if
the
debtor
is
going
to
keep
it,
it
isn't
going
to
be
sold.
but
if
the
creditor
is
going
to
take
it
back
and
sell
it,
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
something
to
somebody
to
do
that,
in
effect--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--typically.
and
i
thought
that
was
the
real
difference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
i'm
wrong.
