mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
common
sense...
the
history
of
the
statute,
in
this
court's
opinion
in
whiting
pools,
all
reflect
that
when
collateral
is
retained
for
the
use
of
the
debtor,
it
has
a
going
concern
or
fair
market
value
that
exceeds
its
liquidation
value
and
that
enhances
the
value
of
the
secured
claim.
this
additional
value--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
judge
easterbrook,
in
that
part
of
his
opinion,
in
the,
what,
hansen
case,
i
believe,
was...
was
thinking--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--ah,
okay.
judge...
that's
a
different
opinion
than
the
one
i
was
referring
to.
what
judge
easterbrook
may
have
been
referring
to
is
the
difference
between
cost,
replacement
cost,
and
value.
replacement
cost
could
include
items
that
would
not
need
to
be
spent
if
the
item
were
to
be
replaced
from
the
own
inventory,
if
you
will,
of
the
debtor.
but
that
doesn't
have...
that
cost
doesn't
relate
to
the
value
of
the
asset.
the
value
of
the
asset
is
dependent
upon
what...
is
dependent
upon
what
the
use...
what
use
can
be
made
of
it.
and
a
debtor
can't
reasonably
say
that
the
value
of
the
asset
in
his
possession
has
a
different
value
than
it
would
in
the
possession
of
anyone
else
who
used
the
same
sort
of
property.
congress
used
an
objective
term,
"value".
and
value
in
that
sense
is
what--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--replacement
cost
is...
is
a
term
that
can
be
used
to
describe
value
in
the
sense
that
value
is
what
a
willing
buyer
would
pay
a
willing
seller
to...
for
the
right
to
use
the
same
property.
that's
the
way
the
court
defined
it
in
the
bfp
case.
and
there's
something
important
in
bfp
that
really
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
replacement
cost
is
normally
what
a
willing
buyer
would
pay
a
willing--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
would
say
it's
the
same,
but
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--but
i...
but...
but
it
depends
on
who
is
paying
it.
i
mean
if
you
use
the
objective
concept
of
the
willing
buyer
and
the
willing
seller,
it's
the
same.
yes.
bfp
makes
the
point
that
the
difference
between
a
liquidation
value
and
a
fair
market
value
is
that
fair
market
value
is
realized
if
an
ample
opportunity
is
given
to
realize
the
full
value
of
the
collateral.
that's
exactly
what
a
chapter
11
and
chapter
13
reorganization
do.
they
give
the
debtor
the
opportunity,
the
ample
opportunities,
the
court
said
in
bfp,
to
realize
the
full
value
of
the
collateral.
now,
that
is
the
value...
the
difference
between
the
fair
market
value
and
the
liquidation
value,
that
premium
or
surplus,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
is
the
heart
of
the
reorganization
concept.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
congress
didn't...
didn't
write
the
statute
that
way.
and...
and...
and
nor
does--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--what...
what
section
506(a)
does,
by
distinguishing
between
disposition
and
use,
distinguishes
between
a
liquidation
and
a
reorganization.
and
in
a
reorganization,
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
that
there
would
be
this
surplus
value
created.
it's...
it's
like
pareto
optimality.
everyone,
debtor
and
creditor
alike,
are
going
to
be
made
better
off.
and
no
one
is
going
to
be
made
worse
off
than
they
would
be
in
a
liquidation.
the
provisions
of
sections
1325
and
1129
that...
that
invoke
this
valuation
process
make
clear
that
congress
didn't
intend
a
liquidation
value
to
apply
when
collateral
is
retained
by
the
debtor.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
text
here,
but
i've
got
to
go
through
it.
1325(a)(5)
and
1129(b)(2)
both
provide
that
the
debtor
can
retain
the
collateral
in
a
reorganization
if
it
pays
the
allowed
amount
of
the
secured
claim
as
determined
under
section
506.
sections
1325(a)(4)
and
1129(a)(7),
by
contrast,
say
that
an
unsecured
creditor
is
only
guaranteed
to
get,
in
a
reorganization,
what
he
would
get
if
the
property
had
been
liquidated.
so
congress
clearly
distinguished
between
the
treatment
of
a
security...
secured
claim
and
an
unsecured
claim
in
reorganizations.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
was
to
say,
we're
going
to
give
them
exactly
the
same
train,
we're
going
to...
treatment...
we're
going
to
abolish
the
distinction,
because
a
secured
creditor,
like
an
unsecured
creditor,
will
only
receive
the
liquidation
value
of
the
asset...
what
he
would
have
gotten
if
there
had
been
a
liquidation.
that
result
plainly
violates
a
fundamental
principle
of
statutory
interpretation,
because
it
nullifies
the
careful
distinctions
that
congress
made
between
secured
and
unsecured
claims
in
these
reorganization
cases.
section
506(a)
itself,
of
course,
specifies
that
this
value
is
to
be
determined
based
upon
the
proposed
disposition
and
use
of
the
property.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
an
example
of
a...
of
a
different
purpose
for
the
valuation
would
be
to...
when
a
creditor
wants
adequate
protection
for
the
use...
for
the
temporary
use
of
the
asset
during
the
period
before...
during...
for
example,
before
a
liquidation
or
at
some
point
during
the
process
of
the
reorganization.
361--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it's
not
some...
it's
not
necessarily
the...
i'm
no...
i
can't
answer,
in
the
abstract,
that
there
would
be
a
different
valuation
for
that.
it's
just
that
you
would
want
to
know
what
the
purpose
of
the
valuation
was.
because,
in
361,
when
you're
determining
whether...
what
you're
supposed
to
decide
is
whether
the
collateral
is
diminishing
in
value
by
its
use
during
the
reorganization
procedures.
and
so,
in
deciding
how
much
it's
diminishing
in
value,
i
suppose
you...
the
purpose
would
be
to
focus
on
that.
whereas
here,
the
purpose
is
to
determine
what
is
the
value
to
be
realized
from
the
use
of
the
collateral...
what
would
a
willing
buyer
pay
a
willing
seller
for
the
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absolutely.
and...
and
in
whiting
pools,
this
court
noted
that
congress
fully
understood
that
you...
that...
that
the...
in
a
reorganization,
when
the
debtor
is
allowed
to
retain
the
collateral,
that
the...
the
value
would
be
greater
than
what
i
think
the
court
said
it
would
be
if
they
scrapped
it,
if
they
sold
it
at
a
foreclosure
sale.
and
in
bfp,
as
i've
already
mentioned,
the
court
explained
that
the
difference...
well,
i
didn't
mention
this...
i
meant
to...
that
in
bfp--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
10
minutes--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
just
kind
of
all
blends
together.
that
in
bfp,
the
court
explained
the
difference
between
a
liquidation
value
and
a
fair
market
value...
well,
i
did
say
this...
is
the...
is
that
you
have
an
ample
opportunity
to
make
the...
to
make...
to
realize
the
full
value
of
the
collateral.
that
is
what
reorganizations
give
you.
they
give
you
that
ample
opportunity
to
get
that
value.
and
the
value
that
you've
gotten
is
the
value
that
is
referred
to
in
506(a).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
only
reason
we're...
the
only
purpose
of
the
valuation
involved
in
this
case
is
if
he
does
qualify
for
a
13,
if
there
is
a
surplus
that
will
be
realized.
sometimes
debtors
can't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--sometimes
debtors'
business
situation
is
such
that
they
cannot...
they
cannot
generate
the
surplus.
they
cannot...
don't
forget,
1325(a)(5)(b)
will
require
that
debtor
to
pay
the
value
of
this
collateral
if
he's
going
to
use
it.
and
chapter
13
is
only
available
if
a
debtor
can
meet
that
requirement.
and
a
debtor
who
can't
meet
that
requirement,
because,
for
example,
his
business
roots
might...
might...
might
not
recognize
the
income
available
from
such
an
asset,
is
a...
is
a
debtor
who
may
not
qualify
under
chapter
13.
congress
did
not
mean
to
let
anyone
qualify.
they
were
very
severe
about
the
requirements.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that's
exactly
what
he
has
to
give
unsecured
creditors.
that's
what
he
has
to
make
sure
unsecured
creditors
get.
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
making
earlier.
1325(a)(5)
says
that
for
a
secured
creditor,
he's
got
to
give
them
the
allowed
amount
of
the
allowed
secured
claim
as
determined
under
section
506.
by
doing
that,
congress
meant
clearly
to
provide
a
different
result
for
the
secured
creditor
than
the
unsecured
creditor.
but
what
the
court
did
here
was
to
treat
them
identically.
and
that
deprived
the
words
of
the
statute
of
any
plausible
meaning.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
