justice
david
h.
souter
but,
in
particular--
--go
on.
no,
please.
go.
in
particular
cases
that
might
be
a
sensible
thing
for...
for
the...
for
the
judge
to
do,
i
take
it.
the
judge
might
very
well
say,
well,
you
know,
i
don't
know
whether
they
buy
it
for
a
dollar
more
than
the
foreclosure
value
or
a
dollar
less
than
retail.
and
the
evidence
is
unclear.
so
the
only
fair
thing
for
me
to
do
in
this
particular
case
is
to
split
the
difference.
i...
i
take
it
you're
not
ruling
out
that
possibility
in
individual
cases,
or
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one
party
says,
well...
we...
we
can
reasonably
hypothesize
three
bidders
at
the
foreclosure
for
the...
for
the
disposal
of
the...
of
the
property,
and
there's
a
fight
about
that.
there
might
be
cases
in
which
the
court
could
say,
look,
i...
i...
i
can't
calibrate
these
probabilities,
and
the
only
sensible
thing
to
do
is
to
say
it's
somewhere
in
the
middle.
you
don't
rule
out
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
argument
is
you
simply
cannot
construe
the
statute,
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
require
that
median
figure?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
his...
but
his
secured
status
is
not
at
all
recognized
as
giving...
as
being
given
any
preference.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
meant...
i
meant
preference
in
the
sense
of
in...
of
incentive
to
go
forward
with
reorganization.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
rather
odd
that
the
secured
creditors
are
the
one
class
that...
that
are
not
treated
any
better.
justice
david
h.
souter
are...
are
there
other
cases
which
are
not
maybe
quite
so
close
as
the
one
involving
a
truck?
suppose
there's
a
business
where
the
secured
property
is
all...
is
all
fixed,
is
machinery,
a
small
business
like
a
laundromat
or
something.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the...
the
foreclosure
value
of
this...
of
this
is...
when
it's
taken
out
is
very,
very
low,
because
the
machinery
is
ripped
out
and
sold
for
almost
scrap.
it
doesn't
seem
fair
that...
that
that
should
be
the
sole
value,
if
the
option...
the
alternative
is
to
keep
this
business
as
a
going
business,
where
the...
where,
in
place,
the
machinery
is
worth
much,
much
more.
i
think
this
case
is
a
little
distorted
because
we
have
a
truck
and
we're
all
used
to
the
idea
of
bluebook
values
and
so
forth.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
point
was
that
the
range
of
values
is
much
more
dramatic.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
say
that
a
truck
doesn't
have
a
going-concern
value,
but
that
really
wasn't
what
was
at
issue
here,
was
it?
it
was
a
truck
by
an
owner
who
had
a
long-term
contractual
relationship
with...
what,
was
it
lane,
the...
the...
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
trucking
concern.
so
that
we...
we
have
something
more
than
a
truck
here.
and
why,
therefore,
isn't
it
fair,
even
on
your
premise,
to
say
there...
there
would
be
a
going-concern
value
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
i...
i...
i'm--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe...
maybe
i'm
making
an
assumption,
in
fact,
that
is
wrong,
but
i
assume
that
if
i
were
to
go
out
in
the
market
and
buy
a
truck,
and
show
up
in
lane's
driveway
tomorrow
morning,
i
would
not
get
the
same
kind
of
preference
for
business
that
this
individual
would.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
he's
got
something
that
i,
as
a
buyer
on
the
open
market,
wouldn't
have,
and
therefore
there
at
least
is
a
sense
in
which--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
lane
believes
in
equal
protection
no
matter
who
shows
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can't
even
shift
the
truck,
and
he's
going
to
give
me
the
business?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
and
the
truck
driver
is
part
of
the
deal.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
the
truck...
the
truck
driver
is
the
one
who
is
going
to
use
the
truck
if
he
retains
it.
and
that
makes
a
difference,
doesn't
it,
economically?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
saying
there
are
two
different
markets.
