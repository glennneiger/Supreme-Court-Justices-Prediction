david
h.
souter
mr....
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
take
the
position
that
every
relationship
of
trust
also
implies
the
duty
to
disclose
if
the
trust
is
to
be
breached?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
we
know
this
is
such
a
case
and
the
others
are
not,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
so
does
a...
i
suppose
a
lawyer
in
a
trust
relationship
with
his
client
in
the
handling
of
funds,
and
yet
if
a
lawyer...
i
presume
that
if
a
lawyer
disclosed
to
his
client
that
he
was
going
to
commingle,
or
he
was
going
to
borrow,
as
it
were,
the
client's
funds
for
personal
reasons,
that
that
would
not
be
a
defense
either
to
a
professional
or
a
statutory
charge
against
him.
perhaps
i'm
wrong
there,
but
i
assumed
it
would
not,
so
i'm
not
sure
why,
then,
number
1
there
is
a
disclosure
obligation
here,
whereas
a
disclosure
obligation
there
would
be
of
no
point--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
the
one
would
be
a
defense
and
the
other
wouldn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
answer
earlier.
i
thought
that
if
there
were
a
disclosure
but
no
consent
that
would
in
effect
preclude
liability.
you're
saying
there
must
be
a
disclosure
and
consent.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
that
case
it's
not
10(b)5.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
one
thing
that
i'm
still
not
clear
on,
and
that
is,
what
is
it
that
is
peculiar
about
some
breaches
of
trust,
or
some
obligations
of
trust,
that
raise
the
disclosure
obligation
whereas
others
do
not
have
a
disclosure
obligation
that
would
at
all
be
relevant?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
the
client
entrusted
just
as
totally
when
he
entrusts
money
as
when
he
entrusts
information?
i
don't
under...
i
guess
my
problem
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
same
as
justice
scalia's.
i
don't...
if
we're
starting
with
a
breach
of
trust,
i
don't
see
why
a
breach
of
trust
with
respect
to
a
fact
which
is
communicated
gives
rise
to
a
disclosure
obligation
when
a
breach
of
trust
with
respect
to
some
other
thing
of
value,
e.g.,
the
contents
of
the
trust
account,
does
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
every
breach
does
give
rise
to
a
duty
to
disclose.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dreeben,
may
i...
you've
come
back
to
10(b),
and
i
had
a
question
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
and
then
i
got
distracted,
and
i'd
like
to
pose
it
now.
you
made
it
clear,
i
think,
that
if
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
simply
disclosed
his
intention
to
use
the
information
but
did
not
receive
authority,
that
there
still
would
be
a
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
that's
the
point
at
which
i
guess
i
got
mixed
up.
you've
clarified
it
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
could
it
have
done
it
another
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's
essentially
a
vagueness
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose
rather
than
a
breach
of
delegated...
or
an
excess
of
delegated
authority.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
basically
is
then
kind
of
an
administrative
process
argument,
and
once
again
it
seems
to
me
you're
not
saying
when
you
make
that
argument
that
they
have
exceeded
their...
that
the
essential
problem
is
that
they
have
exceeded
their
delegated
authority,
but
the
contrast
that
you
are
drawing
is
that
they
were
more
careful
about
predicating
their
exercise
of
delegated
authority.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that's
the
nub
of
what
you're
arguing,
it's
not
that
they've
exceeded
the
authority
in
our
case,
if
that's
the
point
of
your
argument,
but
that
they
just
didn't
go
about
it
the
right
way.
their
process
was
defective.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
then
i
don't--
