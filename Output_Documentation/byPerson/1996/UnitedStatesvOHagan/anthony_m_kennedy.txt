what
if
grand
met
had
its
own
strategy
to
purchase
shares
for
some
reason
to
make
the
price
go
up
temporarily?
i
don't
know
quite
how
the
hypothetical
would
play
out,
but
suppose
this
was
in
grand
met's
interest,
and
yet
all
the
facts
were
the
same.
the
lawyer...
it
didn't
know
the
lawyer
was
doing
it.
it
was
doing
it
on
it's
own,
but
what
the
lawyer
did
was
also
helping
its
grand
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
there
be
a
misappropriation
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
hypothetical
you
and
i
are
discussing,
if
he
came
clean
with
the
law
firm
and
the
whole
law
firm
was
doing
it,
then
no
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
he
didn't
tell
the
client.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
rely
on
disclosure
as
just
a
reverse
mechanism
for
defining
deception.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
read
a
horn-book
on
tort
law
does
it
say
that
the
essence
of
deception
is
nondisclosure?
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
write,
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
you're
saying
is,
is
in
this
case
the
misappropriation
can
only
be
of
relevance,
or
is
of
substantial
relevance,
is
with
reference
to
the
purchase
of
securities.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you
take
the
money
out
of
the
accounts
you
can
go
to
the
racetrack,
or
whatever--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
you're
focusing
on
is
not
the
definition
of
fraud,
not
the
definition
of
deception,
but
in
connection
with
securities.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
wrong
for
me
to
proceed
through
the
statute
and
the
relevant...
and
10(b)
5
by
asking
first,
is
there
fraud?
second,
is
it
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
securities?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
case
that
justice
stevens
put
to
you,
where
the
principal
partner
working
for
grand
met
starts
trading
on
the
inside
information,
that
there
is
fraud
in
the
sense
of
deception.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now...
now,
maybe
that's
right,
maybe
that's
wrong
under
your
view,
and
i'd
like
to
hear
why.
now,
i
could
understand
if
you
went
further
and
said
there's
not
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
securities,
but
that's
quite
a
different
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
all
you're
saying
is,
he
could
have
done
a
lot
of
things
that
were
not
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
security,
but
what
he
did
it
seems
to
me
was
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
security.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
rule
is
written
that
way.
the
rule...
i
know
you're
going
to
bring
me
back
to
the
statute,
but
just
so
far
as
the
rule
is
concerned,
the
rule
says
it's
unlawful
to
have
a
deceit
or
a
fraud
upon
any
person--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
it
doesn't
say
upon
a
purchaser
or
seller
of
securities.
that's
what
it
would
say
if
your
theory
were
to
be
adopted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
suppose
you
go
on
and
say,
and
we
will
treat
these
as
if
they
were
fraudulent
acts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
but
the
sanction
is
the
same.
it
just
says
that
the
sanction
mechanisms
of
the
statute
are
employed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
has
to
be
the
premise
that
they're
necessary
to
avoid
other
fraudulent
acts.
of
course,
the
text
says
fraudulent,
deceptive,
or
manipulative.
it's
kind
of
a
broad
term.
