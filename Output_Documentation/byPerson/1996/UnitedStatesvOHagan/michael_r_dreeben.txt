mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
information
is
the
lifeblood
of
the
securities
markets.
markets
thrive
on
legitimate
efforts
to
acquire,
analyze,
and
use
information,
but
the
deceptive
acquisition
and
use
of
information
in
securities
trading
serves
no
legitimate
purpose.
respondent's
securities
trading
involved
just
such
deception.
respondent
is
a
lawyer
whose
firm
was
entrusted
with
the
confidential
plans
of
a
client
that
had
planned
to
make
a
tender
offer
for
the
pillsbury
company.
while
posing
as
a
loyal
partner
in
his
law
firm,
respondent
misappropriated
that
information
in
breach
of
his
fiduciary
duties
to
the
firm
and
his
client
and
reaped
personal
profits
in
virtually
risk-free
trading
in
pillsbury
stock
and
options.
by
engaging
in
that
form
of
deception
in
connection
with
his
trading,
respondent
violated
three
prohibitions
of
federal
law:
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act,
section
14(e)
of
the
exchange
act,
and
the
mail
fraud
statute.
now,
the
misappropriation
theory
under
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
posits
that
a
fiduciary
or
other
person
with
a
similar
relationship
of
trust
and
confidence
commits
deception
on
the
legitimate
owner
of
information
if
that
fiduciary
or
other
agent
misappropriates
the
information
by
using
it
in
securities
trading,
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
would
not
have
deceived
his
employer.
he
still
would
have
breached
independent
fiduciary
duties
that
he
owed
to
that
employer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
breached
the
securities
laws.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
the
reason
why
that
is
significant
is
that
section
10(b)
prohibits
deceptive
devices
and
contrivances.
it
requires
deception.
the
misappropriation
theory
does
involve
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
but
the
distinctive
factor
about
that
breach
is
that
it
is
a
deceptive
breach.
it
involves,
just
as
the
facts
did
in
carpenter
v.
united
states,
an
agent
entrusted
with
information
by
a
principal
under
the
understanding
between
the
parties
that
the
agent
would
not
use
that
information
for
any
personal
gain
without
obtaining
the
principal's
agreement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
probably
not,
although
there
has
been
litigation
about
whether
in
particular
circumstances
a
family
relationship
is
sufficiently
imbued
with
a
business
context
that
there
is
a
duty
that
runs
to
it,
but
i
accept
the
general
thrust
of
your
hypotheticals.
there
are
forms
of
improper
conduct
that
section
10(b)
does
not
reach,
and
the
reason
why
section
10(b)
does
not
reach
them
is
it
is
a
statute
that
is
framed
to
reach
fraudulent
deceptive
activity
in
connection
with
securities
trading.
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
connection,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
misappropriation
does
not
occur
until
the
lawyer
uses
the
information
as
the
basis
for
his
trades.
it
is
that
very
information
which
drives
his
participation
in
the
market
and
allows
the
profits
to
be
reached...
reaped
by
him.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true.
the
misappropriation
theory
doesn't
rely
on
the
notion
that
he
owed
a
duty
of
disclosure
to
the
shareholders
on
the
other
side
of
the
transaction,
but
it
does
satisfy
the
requisite
connection
between
the
fraud
and
the
securities
trading,
because
it
is
only
in
the
trading
that
the
fraud
is
consummated.
there
could
be
no
closer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
under
the
common
law
view
of
fraud,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
an
accurate
statement,
but
the
securities
laws
are
not
framed
to
pick
up
only
those
violations
that
are
covered
by
common
law
fraud.
congress
did
not
pass
a
statute
that
says,
it
is
unlawful
to
commit
fraud
on
the
purchaser
or
seller
of
securities.
congress
did
not
pass
a
law
even
that
said
it
is
unlawful
to
commit
fraud
in
a
securities
transaction.
it
passed
a
law
with
a
broader
phrase,
in
connection
with
a
securities
transaction,
because
the
very
aim
of
this
section
was
to
pick
up
unforeseen,
cunning,
deceptive
devices
that
people
might
cleverly
use
in
the
securities
markets--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
it's
unusual
to
give
the
text
of
this
statute
its
natural
reading.
what
it
requires
is
proof
of
fraud,
and
then
it
requires
proof
that
there's
a
connection
between
the
fraud
and
the
trading.
in
this
case,
as
i've
said,
there
could
be
no
closer
connection.
it
is
only
by
the
trading
itself
that
the
fraud
is
consummated,
and
that
is
exactly
a
connection
that
is
picked
up
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
there
would.
first
of
all
that
wouldn't
have
any
effect
on
the
violation
that
respondent
committed
on
his
law
firm.
he
owed
his
law
firm
a
duty
of
trust
and
confidence
in
addition
to
the
duty
he
owed
to
the
client,
but
more
importantly
than
that,
in
this
case
there
was
no
evidence
that
grand
met
knew
about--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
he
didn't
deceive
anyone
by
doing
this,
he
would
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
then
the
client
would
be
deceived.
whoever
does
not
know
about
this
and
has
not
authorized
it
is
a
victim
of
the
fraud,
just
as
in
the
carpenter
case,
if
weinans
had
gone
to
the
wall
street
journal
and
said,
look,
you
know,
you're
not
paying
me
very
much.
i'd
like
to
make
a
little
bit
more
money
by
buying
stock,
the
stocks
that
are
going
to
appear
in
my
heard
on
the
street
column,
and
the
wall
street
journal
said,
that's
fine,
there
would
have
been
no
deception
of
the
wall
street
journal.
the
statute
does
require
deception,
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
a
case
like
this
that
there
is
deception.
this
is
the
identical
kind
of
fraudulent
conduct
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
carpenter
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
property
interest
here
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
in
carpenter.
it's
the
information
itself,
which
grand
met
has
a
right
to
determine
how
it
would
be
used.
it
has
a
right
to
maintain
its
exclusive
right
to
use
the
information
and
not
to
have
the
agents,
upon
whom
it
must
rely
if
it's
going
to
engage
in
any
kind
of
business
activity,
misappropriate
that
information
for
personal
gain,
and
i
think
it's
a
very
well-settled
concept
of
the
common
law
and
of
the
law
of
fraud
that
information
is
a
species
of
property,
so
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--so
the
deceptive
conduct
here
is,
in
essence,
indistinguishable
from
the
deceptive
conduct
that
the
court
found
in
the
carpenter
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't,
justice
souter.
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
this
is
such
a
case
because
it
involves
a
relationship
right
at
the
core
of
what
has
been
defined
as
the
principal
agent-fiduciary
trustee
relationship.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
souter,
the
reason
why
it
makes
a
difference
is
that
the
disclosure
obligation
is
a
prerequisite
to
obtaining
the
consent
of
the
principal
or
the
owner
of
the
trust.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
satisfy
the
common
law
rule
that
a
trustee
may
not
use
the
property
that's
been
entrusted
with
him,
there
would
have
to
be
consent.
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
securities
act
that
there
be
no
deception,
there
would
only
have
to
be
disclosure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
it
would
still
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
10(b)5.
it
would
still
be
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
but
that
makes
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
here.
not
every
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
involves
deception,
but
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
when
that
breach
involves
the
obligation
to
make
disclosure
does
involve
deception.
that,
in
fact,
is
the
foundation
of
this
court's
rulings
in
chiarella
and
dirks
that
an
insider
in
a
corporation
has
a
duty
to
his
shareholders
to
make
disclosure
before
trading
with
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
answer,
justice
souter,
is
that
there
are
some
things
that
a
trustee
cannot
do
even
if
he
does
disclose
them.
they
will
still
be
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty,
but
there
are
some
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
that
inherently
require
a
breach
of
the
duty
to
make
disclosure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
i
think
that
it's
clear
under
this
court's
decisions
in
chiarella
and
dirks
that
generally
silence
is
not
fraudulent
in
conducting
a
transaction,
but
it
becomes
fraudulent
if
there
is
a
duty
to
make
disclosure,
and
the
court
in
the
chiarella
and
dirks
cases
looked
to
well-settled
understandings
which
it
then
believed
were
incorporated
into
10(b)
about
when
disclosure
is
required.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
do
anything
more
than
to
reaffirm
the
basic
principle
that
it
adopted
in
carpenter
v.
united
states
that
an
agent
who
misappropriates
his
principal's
property
by
posing
as
a
loyal
employee
when
in
fact
he's
reaping
personal
gain
with
that
property
has
committed
a
form
of
deception,
indeed,
a
form
of
fraud,
and
that
fraud
satisfies
both
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
it
satisfies
section
10(b).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
think
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose
to
the
client
as
well.
i
think
that
there
are
two
victims,
direct
victims
of
the
deception.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
there
would,
but
we
would
not
have
been
able
to
charge
it
the
same
way
as
we
charged
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
in
this
case,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
could
rely
on
a
finding
of
a
breach
of
duty
either
to
the
law
firm
or
to
the
client
or
to
both,
and
it
had
to
be
unanimous
about
which
one
it
found,
but
it
had
to
find
one
or
the
other,
or
it
could
find
both,
and
if
there
was
disclosure,
the
party
that
received
the
disclosure
would
not
be
a
victim
of
the
fraud
on
our
theory.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
and
i
say
that
there
is
an
omission
by
the
failure
to
disclose
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
there
was
in
carpenter.
i
also
believe
that
the
court
has
never
ruled
out
what
seems
commonsensical
under
10(b),
the
idea
that
the
conduct
itself,
even
without
a
statement
or
an
omission,
can
be
deceptive.
i
mean,
here
you
have
a
lawyer
who
worked
in
his
firm,
came
to
work
every
day
posing
as
a
loyal
partner,
engaging
his
partners
in
discussions
about
firm
business,
under
the
understanding
that
he
was
doing
this
in
the
interests
of
the
firm,
when
in
fact,
as
the
jury
concluded,
he
used
the
information
that
he
acquired
to
finance...
to
enable
his
own
securities
purchases
and
to
profit--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
the
court...
yes,
justice
scalia,
and
the
court
said--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
fact--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
do
not
think
that
you
have.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
not
just
as
much
as
this
one
is,
because
in
this
case
it
is
the
use
of
the
information
that
enables
the
profits,
pure
and
simple.
there
would
be
no
opportunity
to
engage
in
profit--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
difference--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
difference,
justice
scalia,
is
that
once
you
have
the
money
you
can
do
anything
you
want
with
it.
in
a
sense,
the
fraud
is
complete
at
that
point,
and
then
you
go
on
and
you
can
use
the
money
to
finance
any
number
of
other
activities,
but
the
connection
is
far
less
close
than
in
this
case,
where
the
only
value
of
this
information
for
persona
profit
for
respondent
was
to
take
it
and
profit
in
the
securities
markets
by
trading
on
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
does,
justice
souter.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
perhaps
was
not
clear
in
answering
justice
scalia,
justice
souter.
it
is
just
as
much
of
a
breach,
and
it
is
just
as
much
fraudulent
and
deceptive,
and
that,
in
fact,
is
what
the
court
said
in
carpenter.
embezzlement
is
a
form
of
fraud.
the
question
is
whether
that
fraud
is
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
the
security,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
form
of
fraud
which
i
submit
is
complete
at
the
time
the
money
is
obtained
is
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
versus
this
one.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
every
breach
that
involves
the
misuse
of
information
entrusted
to
a
person
or
the
misuse
of
property
entrusted
to
a
person--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--for
personal
gain,
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
hornbook
law,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
dispute
about
that
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
exactly.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
exactly
right,
and
because
of
that
difference,
three
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
kind
of
misappropriation
of
property
is
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
other
kinds
of
misappropriation
of
property
may
or
may
not,
but
this
is
a
unique
form
of
fraud,
unique
to
the
securities
markets,
in
fact,
because
the
only
way
in
which
respondent
could
have
profited
through
this
information
is
by
either
trading
on
it
or
by
tipping
somebody
else
to
enable
their
trades.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
there
would.
in
a
case
like
that,
justice
ginsburg,
a
fiduciary
cannot
do
indirectly
what
he's
prohibited
from
doing
directly,
and
so
using
the
child
as
the
medium
for
conducting
the
transaction
would
be
equally
forbidden.
i
think
justice
o'connor's
question
was
getting
at
the
point
about
whether
the
child
would
be
committing
fraud
on
the
parent
if
the
child
engaged
in
this
trading
after
having
learned
inadvertently--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--of
the
information,
and
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
certainly
think
that
14(e)
provides
us
with
a
perfectly
valid
argument
for
liability.
the
theory
under
section
14
is
that
congress
specifically
gave
the
commission
regulatory
authority
in
the
area
of
tender
offers
because
it
recognized
that
tender
offers
pose
a
very
significant
threat
to
investors
in
the
target
company
having
the
ability
to
make
decisions
about
whether
to
buy,
sell,
or
hold
when
a
tender
offer
is
on
the
horizon.
congress
also
knew
that
there
is
a
great
opportunity
for
insider
profiting
because
the
information
about
a
tender
offer
is
necessarily
circulated
to
many
professionals
in
advance
of
the
tender
offer
who
then
have
the
opportunity
to
go
out
and
trade
on
it,
and
as
a
result
of
its
recognition
about
the
dangers
of
fraudulent
and
deceptive
practices
and
tender
offers,
congress
was
not
content
to
rely
simply
on
section
10(b)
but
drafted
a
new
and
different
antifraud
provision
which
is
backed
up
by
regulatory
authority
that
gives
the
sec
the
power
to
define
and
prescribe
means
reasonably
designed
to
prevent
fraudulent,
deceptive,
manipulative
conduct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
are
several
reasons,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
why
i
think
that
you're
correct
that
i
omitted
the
words,
acts
or
practices
as
are
fraudulent,
but
i
think
that
the
statute
is
accurately
paraphrased
the
way
that
i
read
it.
first,
the
regulatory
authority
that
is
found
in
section
14(e)
was
modeled
on
a
different
section
of
the
securities
laws,
not
section
10(b),
but
section
15(c),
which
dealt
with
regulating
broker-dealers,
and
in
that
context
congress
had
specifically
given
the
sec
the
authority
to
define
fraudulent
practices
because
it
wanted
to
establish
a
higher
standard
of
obligations
and
duties
than
would
otherwise
be
imposed
by
the
common
law.
it
adopted
that
language
in
section
14(e)
after
the
sec
had
previously
exercised
its
power
to
create
new
obligations
that
weren't
found
in
the
common
law,
unless
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
congress
expected
that
authority
to
be
exercised
in
that
fashion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
actually
the
schreiber
case,
justice
o'connor,
didn't
involve
any
sec
regulation
at
all.
it
involved
simply
the
question
about
whether
a
fully
disclosed
act
would
be
deemed
manipulative
under
the
first
sentence
of
section
14(e).
there
were
no
regulations
at
issue
in
the
case
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
footnote,
read
in
context,
says
that
the
mere
promulgation
of
the
regulatory
authority
for
the
sec,
the
addition
of
the
sentence
that
gave
the
sec
regulatory
authority,
didn't
change
the
meanings
of
the
words
in
the
first
sentence,
but
the
court
expressly
recognized
that
congress
had
authority...
that
congress
had
given
authority
to
the
sec
not
only
to
define
acts
or
practices
as
are
fraudulent
but
to
prescribe
means
reasonably
designed
to
prevent
them,
and
the
court
explicitly
said
there
that
the
sec
could
prohibit
nondeceptive
conduct
as
a
means
reasonably
designed
to
prevent
fraud.
so
the
court
in
schreiber
i
think
did
acknowledge
that
the
sec
has
very
vast
regulatory
power
in
order
to
protect
against
the
abuses
that
congress
had
identified
in
the
tender
offer
context.
rule
14(e)
3
does
that
by
establishing
a
flat
ban
on
trading
by
persons
who
come
into
possession
of
information
about
an
upcoming
tender
offer
when
they
know
that
it
was
received
from
the
bidder
or
somebody
acting
on
its
behalf,
and
that
flat
ban
serves
two
valuable
purposes.
the
first
is
that
it
protects
shareholders
who
are
going
to
be
facing
a
tender
offer,
or
who
actually
are
facing
a
tender
offer,
from
not
having
adequate
time
and
adequate
information
to
make
a
decision
whether
to
buy,
sell,
or
hold.
it
also
prevents
collusion
between
the
bidder
and
other
parties
operating
in
the
marketplace
that
has
not
disclosed
to
the
marketplace,
as
the
williams
act
requires,
from
buying
up
stock
from
unsuspecting
shareholders
in
the
target
company.
a
second
purpose
that
is
served
by
14(e)3
is
the
prevention
of
fraudulent
activity
that
involves,
as
this
case
did,
the
deceptive
acquisition
of
information
from
the
bidder
or
law
firm's
accountants,
investment
bankers
that
represent
it,
and
it
thereby
serves
to
prevent
that
kind
of
fraud
from
occurring,
which
is
a
very
great
danger,
and
which
involves
a
very
great
danger
of
not
being
detected,
because
this
is
in
essence
a
crime
that
involves
surreptitious
activity
that
is
not
often
easy
to
bring
to
light.
so
14(e)3
carves
out
in
the
tender
offer
context
very
special
heightened
rules.
it
carves
out
and
creates
in
the
tender
offer
context
a
disclose
or
abstain
from
trading
obligation,
but
it
does
not
apply,
as
section
10(b)
does,
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
of
securities
transactions
in
which
the
misuse
of
information
can
pose
very
serious
threats.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
sorry,
which
section?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
the
sec
has
defined
the
acts
that
are
prohibited
in
14(e)3,
it
does
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
think
that
that
is
justified,
justice
o'connor,
on
two
bases.
first,
rule
14(e)3
in
essence
creates
the
duty
to
make
disclosure,
drawing
on
congress'
recognition
that
tender
offers
pose
particular
shareholder
harms,
and
they
pose
particular
dangers
that
the
shareholders
will
not
be
able
to
make
an
important
decision.
the
sec
drew
on
the
regulatory
authority
it
was
given
to
impose
a
duty
to
make
disclosure,
and
second,
the
sec's
rule
prevents
violations
that
are
akin
to
the
misappropriation
violation
that
occurs
under
section
10(b)
by
ensuring
that
when
someone
has
material
information
of
this
character,
they
simply
may
not
trade,
even
when
there
is
no
proof
of
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
and
deception
in
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
extend
liability
to
the
thief
so
long
as
the
thief
acquired
the
information
from
the
bidder
or
somebody
acting
on
its
behalf
and
knew
that.
now,
what
is
important
about
section
10(b)'s
application
to
fraudulent
conduct
of
this
kind
is
that
investors
in
the
securities
markets
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
markets
are
essentially
honest.
no
investor
expects
that
he
may
have
the
skill,
expertise,
or
analytical
ability
of
everybody
else
in
the
market,
and
everyone
who
enters
the
market
knows
that
they
may
be
trading
with
somebody
who's
smarter
than
you
are
or
better
informed,
and
you're
going
to
lose.
but
investors
do
assume
that
they
are
not
trading
with
someone
who
acquired
the
informational
advantage
simply
by
fraud,
simply
by
stealing
information
in
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
and
using
it
for
trading.
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
think
that
my
position
on
that
is
that
if
there
is
disclosure
to
the
client
there
would
be
no
deception
of
the
client.
if
there's
disclosure
to
the
firm,
there
would
be
no
deception
of
the
firm.
there
might
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--okay.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
order
to
convict
respondent
on
the
section
10(b)
count,
the
jury
had
to
find
that
he
acted
with
the
intent
to
deceive,
manipulate,
or
deprive...
these
are
in
the
jury
instructions
at
page
199
of
the
joint
appendix...
and
the
statutory
requirement
for
the
imposition
of
imprisonment
requires
that
he
be
shown
to
have
knowledge
of
the
regulation
or
rule
that
he
violated.
he
cannot
show
that...
if
he
shows
that
he
did
not
have
knowledge
of
it,
he
cannot
be
imprisoned,
but
the
statute
does
require
proof
of
wilfulness
in
order
to
sustain
any
criminal
conviction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
it
is,
justice
scalia.
the
ultimate...
may
i
answer?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
sec's
prohibition
on
trading,
which
is
clearly
described
in
the
rule,
is
within
its
statutory
authority
which
is
a
question
for
the
court,
and
the
court
may
determine
that
the
sec's
prohibition
does
satisfy
the
statute
based
on
either
the
defining
prong
or
the
means
reasonably
designed
to
prevent,
and
it's
analysis
of
the
reasons
that
are
given.
we
address
this
question
in
our
brief
in
opposition
in
the
chestman
case.
