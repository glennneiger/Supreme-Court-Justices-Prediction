mr.
john
d.
french
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
a
regular
substantial
investor
in
the
stock
market.
he
was
convicted
of
57
counts
arising
out
of
an
alleged
securities
fraud
and
sentenced
to
41
months
in
prison.
the
basis
of
that
conviction
was
a
set
of
legal
theories
that
are
not
incorporated
into
the
text
of
any
statute,
that
have
sown
confusion
among
the
courts,
and
that
provide
no
guidance
to
participants
in
the
stock
market.
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
briefly
the
application
of
the
government's
theories
to
what
are,
for
purposes
of
this
appeal,
the
undisputed
facts
in
this
case.
i
am
not
now
contesting
facts.
i
am
asking
the
court
to
think
about
the
way
the
government's
theories
apply
to
these
facts.
on
august
12,
1988,
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
a
british
firm
called
grand
metropolitan
had
put
its
hotel
subsidiary,
intercontinental,
up
for
auction
to
raise
money
for
an
acquisition.
on
august
18,
just
6
days
later,
a
financial
columnist
named
dan
dorfman,
announced
on
the
cable
news
network
that
people
close
to
grand
metropolitan...
and
that
is
a
common
synonym
in
the
trade
for
people
inside
grand
metropolitan...
are
telling
people
in
the
street
that
grand
metropolitan
is
interested
in
acquiring
pillsbury.
also
on
august
18,
a
broker
called
respondent
to
advise
that
he'd
received
a
$9
million
order
to
buy
250,000
shares
of
pillsbury
stock
for
a
customer
in
london.
mr.
john
d.
french
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
a
theory
can
be
applied
to
result
in
a
conviction
of
mr.
o'hagan
on
the
basis
of
facts
which
very
clearly
in
the
record
indicated
that
he
placed
all
of
his
orders
for
pillsbury
options
before
august
26,
and
the
government
only
indicts
him,
as
the
prosecutor
says,
for
trades
made
from
august
26
on,
then
the
theory
is
grotesque.
you
cannot,
with--
mr.
john
d.
french
--the
relevant
information
was
in
the
public
domain
and,
as
your
honor
knows,
you
may
only
be
convicted,
even
under
the
government's
theory,
if
you
trade
on
the
basis
of.
mr.
john
d.
french
that's--
mr.
john
d.
french
--in
my
view,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
statute
that
involves,
as
mr.
dreeben
said,
disclosure.
if
mr.
o'hagan
had
made...
had
had
this
private,
nonpublic
information
that
you're
hypothesizing
and
disclosed
to
the
dorsey
firm
that
he
was
going
to
trade
on
it,
according
to
the
government's
theory
he
couldn't
have
been
prosecuted.
to
me,
that
seems
to
be
preposterous.
what's
wrong
with
the
government's
theory
is,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
unfair
advantage
being
taken
of
a
participant
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
john
d.
french
in
my
view,
according
to
the
government's
theory,
the
statute
would
apply.
no.
in
my
view,
the
statute
cannot
apply.
there
has
been
no--
mr.
john
d.
french
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
french
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
in
my
view,
it
could
not
apply
because--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
certainly
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
wouldn't
be
here
today,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
john
d.
french
--the
statute
encompasses
deception,
and
in
the
context
of
a
nondisclosure,
deception
occurs
in
the
presence
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
the
lawyer
inside
pillsbury
has
a
fiduciary
duty
to
the
pillsbury
shareholders.
the
lawyer
outside
pillsbury
does
not
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
the
pillsbury
shareholders.
mr.
john
d.
french
that's
correct.
he
has
to
have
deceived
the
sellers
in
order--
mr.
john
d.
french
--a
deception
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security
is
the
basis
of--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i'm
focusing
on
two
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
what
the
congress
tried
to
adopt
here
was
something
to
prevent
securities
fraud.
i
don't
believe
the
congress
is
attempting
to
regulate
the
relationships
between
lawyers
and
their
firms,
which
are
regulated
by
codes
of
professional
responsibility,
or
husbands
and
wives,
or
fathers
and
sons,
which
is
the
context
in
which
these
misappropriation
cases
come
up.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
is
possible--
mr.
john
d.
french
--there
is
not
even
deception
there.
there
is
theft,
and
contrary
to
mr.
dreeben's
position,
theft
of
a
piece
of
information
is
no
different
from
theft
of
money.
it's
not
fraud.
you
can
be
prosecuted
for
the
theft
vis-a-vis
yourself
and
the
person
from
whom
you
stole,
or
the
person
from
whom
you
stole
may
proceed
against
you
to
recover
the
money,
but
it's
not
deception.
otherwise,
every
single
theft
would
result
in
a
prosecution
for
fraud,
and
that
never
happens.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
suggests
that
theft
can
be
brought
within
the
mail
fraud
statute,
your
honor.
as
to
the
securities
fraud
statute,
the
court
was
equally
divided,
and
therefore
i
don't
know
what
the
court
thinks
with
respect
to
that
issue.
the
government
cannot
rely
on
carpenter
with
respect
to
the
mail
fraud
claim.
mr.
john
d.
french
yes,
justice
breyer.
i
have
several
problems
with
it.
one
is
that
under
the
misappropriation
theory
no
one
will
ever
really
know,
because
the
misappropriation
theory,
even
in
the
courts
that
have
adopted
it
and
follow
it,
is
so
confusing
that
the
courts
themselves...
the
court
in
chestman,
for
example,
says
when
you
get
outside
the
relationship
with
the
shareholder,
the...
knowing
whether
or
not
the
relationship
applies
is
unclear.
mr.
john
d.
french
well,
it
would
be
very
helpful
if
that
turned
out
to
be,
as
the
government
prosecutes
these
cases,
the
instruction.
there
are
several
instructions
in
this
case,
as
the
record
shows,
against
mr.
o'hagan,
that
tell
the
jury
that
he
doesn't
have
to
know
elements
of
the
offense,
for
instance
that
he
didn't
have
to
know
substantial
steps
were
taken.
but
to
me,
it
doesn't
answer
the
question.
i
believe,
as
judge
luttig
said
in
the
bryan
case,
this
mode
of
analysis
pulls
apart
a
unitary
concept.
the
unitary
concept
is
deception
or
manipulation
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
to
me,
that
means
the
buyer
or
seller
of
the
security
deceives
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
transaction.
it's
not
as
if
you
deceive
someone
over
here
and
then
later
on
you
benefit
from
it
by
dealing
with
somebody
else.
mr.
dreeben's
remark,
it
seems
to
me,
fits
with
my
theory
of
this
case.
he
says,
there...
it
has
to
be
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security
because
the
only
way
mr.
o'hagan
could
profit
was
in
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
not
so.
that
assumes
mr.
o'hagan
has
no
imagination.
mr.
o'hagan
could
have
said,
i
now
have
a
useful
piece
of
information.
i
have
misappropriated
it.
i'm
going
to
profit
on
it
by
selling
it
to
the
trade
press.
i
can
get
a
good
fee
for
this
information.
so
the
misappropriation
would
have
occurred,
but
it
had
been
disconnected
from
the
purchase
or
sale
of
the
security.
mr.
john
d.
french
all
right.
i'll
give
you
another
hypothetical,
your
honor,
because
i'm
firmly
convinced
that
the
statute
doesn't
read
the
way
mr.
dreeben
says
it
does.
you
cannot
disconnect
the
misappropriation
from
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities
and
say
it's
satisfied.
mr.
o'hagan's
office
in
minneapolis
is
across
the
street
from
the
pillsbury
company.
he
could
have
said
to
himself,
i
have
always
wanted
the
business
of
the
pillsbury
company.
i
will
walk
across
the
street,
misappropriating
this
information
of
my
law
firm
and
its
client,
deliver
it
to
the
pillsbury
company,
and
suggest
to
the
pillsbury
company
that
in
the
future
they
might
find
it
very
desirable
to
use
me
for
legal
work.
that
wouldn't
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
the
security,
and
yet
it
would
have
profited
mr.
o'hagan
if
it
had
worked.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
cases
of
this
court
have
confined
the
statute
to
relationships
between
market
participants.
i
admit
not
merely
buyers
and
sellers.
they've
included
brokers.
they've
included
other
investors.
but
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
fraud,
neither
dorsey
&
whitney
nor
grand
met
was
a
market
participant.
grand
met
had
a
desire
for
a
takeover.
it
had
no
money
for
the
takeover.
the
transactions
presumably
ended
by
august
26.
grand
met's
own
chief
financial
officer
said
that
by
september
18th
they
still
didn't
have
the
money.
they
wanted
to
make
a
takeover.
they
couldn't
make
a
takeover.
it
wasn't
until
october
4th
that
the
takeover
was
proposed,
was
announced,
so
we
have,
i
think
for
the
very
first
time,
a
proposal
by
the
government
that
a
fraud
on
a
nonmarket
participant
be
deemed
to
be
in
connection
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
mr.
john
d.
french
right.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
agree
it
says
any
person,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
rules
are
not
allowed
to
stray
outside
the
scope
of
their
statute.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
would
up
until
a
point
but
there's
a
whole
panoply
of
regulation
relating
to
tender
offers.
once
you've
embarked
on
a
tender
offer
you
have
to
announce
it,
and
there's
restraints
on
how
you
can
conduct
it,
and
you
cannot
make
misrepresentations
in
connection
with
it.
i
do
not
think
this
particular
reading
of
this
statute
is
necessary
to
keep
tender
offers
clean.
mr.
john
d.
french
well,
justice
ginsburg,
two
things
about
the
1988
legislation.
first,
it
was
adopted...
whatever
they
mean,
it
was
adopted
after
my
client's
acts,
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
he
can't
have
anticipated--
mr.
john
d.
french
--yes.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
think
what
i'd
like
the
court
to
do
is
think
about
all
of
the
legislation
and
attempted
legislation
throughout
the
1980's
in
thinking
about
that
issue.
in
1984,
the
sec
went
to
the
congress
and
proposed
legislation
that
would
have
covered
this
subject
matter,
would
have
covered
the
misappropriation
area,
and
then
when
congress
got
ready
to
enact
it
said
no,
we
would
prefer
vagueness
and
ambiguity.
please
don't
enact
it.
then
in
1987,
when
the
sec
went
to
the
congress
with
a
proposal
to
enact
the
misappropriation
theory,
the
congress
rejected
it.
then
in
'88
it
enacted
something
having
to
do
with
participants
in
the
market
that
once
again
did
not
amend
the
language
of
10(b)5,
so
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
basis
for
saying,
as
some
of
the
amici
have
said,
that
the
congress
has
codified
these
theories
into
law.
it
has
not
enacted
any
of
this
into
law.
so
my
answer
is
the
1984
legislation
and
the
1988
legislation
have
to
be
left
to
apply
to
10b-5
as
interpreted
ultimately
by
this
court,
and
the
congress,
if
it
wants
to
get
the
misappropriation
theory
into
law,
has
to
write
it
into
law.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
disagree,
your
honor.
the
amici
briefs...
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
says
the
congress
codified
the
misappropriation
theory.
the
government
says
the
congress
has
validated
the
misappropriation
theory.
a
third
amicus
brief
says
the
congress
has
not
codified
the
misappropriation
theory,
but
ratified
it.
i
don't
know
what
ratified
or
validated
means
in
these
circumstances.
i
know
what
enact
means.
congress
has
not
enacted
it.
so
yes,
i
disagree.
mr.
john
d.
french
i'd
be
happy--
mr.
john
d.
french
--yes,
justice
breyer.
what
we
have
is
a...
and
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
ask
this
court
to
reverse
several
decades'
worth
of
law,
but
what
we
have
is
a
situation
that's
slipped
its
moorings.
insider
trading
was
supposed
to
be
governed
by
section
16(b).
katie
roberts
worked
very
hard
to
get
insider
trading
under
10(b)
more
than
30
years
after
the
statute
was
passed
by
saying
it
depends
upon
nondisclosure
as
between
participants
to
a
transaction.
this
court
went
along
with
that
in
chiarella,
but
not
further.
what
the
congress
needs,
if
it
wants
to
get
passed...
and
i
can
even
conceptually
do
that.
i
can...
in
my
mind
i
can
say,
misrepresentation...
deception
can
encompass
nondisclosure
when
there
is
a
duty
to
speak.
i
can't
get
beyond
that.
so
if
the
congress
wants
within
the
framework
of
60
years
of
law
to
get
beyond
misrepresentation
or
nondisclosure
constituting
deception
when
there's
a
duty
to
speak,
it
should
pass
a
statute
about
it,
which
it
has
not.
perhaps
i
should
move
to
14(e).
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
serious
problems
with
14(e)
which
i
think
the
government
cannot
deal
with.
one
is
the
agency
has
not
promulgated
rules
designed
to
help
prevent
frauds
from
arising.
it
simply
redefined
the
word
fraud.
the
statute
prohibits
fraudulent,
deceptive,
or
manipulative
acts.
the
sec
announces
that
something
is
a
fraudulent,
deceptive,
or
manipulative
act
which
doesn't
have
any
element
of
fraud
in
it.
it
just
says
you
can't
trade
if
you
have
the
information.
again,
if
you
look
at
one
of
the
courts
that's
gone
along
with
the
rule,
sec
v.
maio
in
the
seventh
circuit,
says
the
rule
requires
a
duty
to
disclose
regardless
of
whether
such
information
was
obtained
through
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
has
just
outstripped
the
statute
it's
supposed
to
be
implementing,
and
that's
impermissible.
the
second
thing
wrong
with
the
rule
is,
the
rule
says
you
mustn't
trade
in
connection
with
a
tender
offer.
the
sec
has
said
you
may
not
trade
if
substantial
steps
have
been
taken
toward
a
tender
offer.
that's
not
in
the
law.
that
is
an
accretion
to
the
law
that's
not
there.
it--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
do,
but
i
don't
concede
that
it
authorizes
them
to
change
the
criminal
application
of
this
statute.
if
the
court
when
it
has
an--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i'm...
i'll
say
two
things.
first,
it
plainly
can't
do
it
in
the
criminal
context
because
it
can't
transform
fraud
into
nonfraud
and
say,
this
is
criminal,
but
beyond
that,
what
i
think
it
can
do--
mr.
john
d.
french
--no,
your
honor.
this
redefines
the
word,
fraud.
it
says,
it
shall
be,
it
shall
constitute
fraudulent
activity
if
you
purchase
after
substantial
steps
have
been
taken.
mr.
john
d.
french
the
rule
is
false.
the
rule
is--
mr.
john
d.
french
--the
rule
is
false.
moreover--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
don't
think
it
could
do...
let
me
try
to
do
this
in
conjunction.
i
don't
think
it
could
do
this
in
another
way
because
there's
no
definition
of
substantial
steps,
and
it
is
not
possible
for
most
participants
in
securities
transactions
to
know
that
substantial
steps
have
been
taken.
mr.
john
d.
french
it
certainly
is
a
vague--
mr.
john
d.
french
--that's
correct.
may
i
take
an
example
in
an
area
in
which
i
practice
heavily.
the
federal
trade
commission
act
prohibits
deceptive
acts,
unfair
or
deceptive
acts
or
practices.
in
the
context
of
that
statute
the
agency,
in
prosecuting
for
deception,
just
takes
straightforward
misrepresentations,
lots
of
different
kinds
but
straightforward
misrepresentations.
in
the
concept
of
unfairness,
it
treads
very
carefully,
conducts
investigations,
promulgates
trade
regulation
rules,
and
then
says
we
have
identified
a
practice
here
that
we
deem
to
be
unfair.
we
haven't
amended
the
law
to
allow
us
to
prohibit
things
that
are
fair.
we've
identified
this
act
as
unfair.
and
then
it
goes
forward
on
a
very
careful
basis
with
prosecutions
that
only
lead
to
injunctive
results.
mr.
john
d.
french
and
they
certainly
have
been
more
careful.
mr.
john
d.
french
no,
i
really
am
going
beyond
that.
i
am--
mr.
john
d.
french
--i
am
saying...
i
am
saying
that
when
the
statute
says
you
must
not
commit
fraud
in
connection
with
a
tender
offer,
the
agency
cannot
say,
you
are
also
subject
to
prosecution
when...
even
when
you
don't
commit
fraud,
and
even
when
no
tender
offer
has
been
launched,
but
because
substantial
steps
have
been
taken.
that
rewrites
the
law.
that
is
not
a
rule
that
implements
the
law.
it
rewrites
the
law,
and
that's
the
distinction
i'm
drawing.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
don't
recall
the
language
producing
the
implementation.
mr.
john
d.
french
you
can
put
into
a
class
of
prohibited
conduct
in
some
way
or
another
things
that
you
define
as
reasonably
designed
to
prevent
fraudulent
acts.
mr.
john
d.
french
i
do
not
believe
you
can
go
on
and
say,
you
may
treat...
we
will
treat
these
as
fraudulent
acts.
there
has
to
be
for
people
to
be
not
at
risk
all
the
times--
mr.
john
d.
french
--you
may
not,
your
honor,
i
think,
put
people
at
risk
of
prosecution
for
fraudulent
acts
committed
in
connection
with
a
tender
offer
by
announcing
that
nonfraudulent
acts
are
fraudulent
acts
and
can
be
prosecuted
when
there
isn't
any--
mr.
john
d.
french
--it
certainly
is,
but
i
believe
the
court
in
schreiber
has
equated
deceptive
and
manipulative
under
this
statute
with
deceptive
and
manipulative
under
10(b),
so
it
has
some
content
that
narrows
somewhat
the
breadth
of
it.
i
don't
know
if
the
court
wishes
me
to
speak
on
the
subject
of
mail
fraud.
mr.
dreeben
did
not,
and
i'm
willing
to
leave
it
to
the
briefs.
i
would
say
with
respect
to
that
that
all
that
happened
here
is
that
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
john
d.
french
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
