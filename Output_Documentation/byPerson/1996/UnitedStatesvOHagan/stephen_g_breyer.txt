justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
possible
that
some
of
these
difficult
cases...
you
know,
what
you
call
the
preposterous
cases,
the
mothers,
whatever
it
is...
would
be
fairly
dealt
with
through
a
requirement
that
a
criminal
conviction
must
be
willful?
i
notice
that
word
was
in
the
criminal
section,
and
does
wilful
mean
that
in
this
area,
if
you
don't
know
the
law,
that's
an
excuse,
so
therefore
in
any
of
these
borderline
cases
a
defendant
who
didn't
realize
that
what
he
was
doing
was
against
the
securities
law
would
be
home
free,
and
this
would
be
reserved
for
the
instances
where
people
know
that
what
they're
doing
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
securities
law.
i'd
like
your
reaction
to
that.
i'm
not
certain
whether
that's
correct
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
see,
that's
the
basis
of
my
question.
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
if
he
didn't
know
that
what
he
was
doing
was
unlawful,
he
hasn't
done
it
willfully.
i'm
thinking
of
ratzlaf.
i'm
thinking
of
the
cases
that
interpret
willfully,
and
i
wonder
if
that
saves
for
the
government...
saves
them
from
your
argument,
because
you're
arguing
this
is
all
very
unclear,
and
that's
what
i'd
like
a
response
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
have
to
assume
that
congress
wouldn't
intend...
on
your
theory
we
could
take
the
insiders,
the
most
complete
insiders
of
a
corporation,
say
grand
met
if
it
were
american,
and
they
could
go
out
and
buy
all
the
shares
they
wanted,
knowing
that
those
companies
are
about
to
be
taken
over.
they
can
buy
the
shares
of
the
companies
that
are
about
to
be
taken
over,
and
that
would
be
lawful
under
the
securities
law,
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
hasn't
congress...
what
i'm
actually
thinking,
congress
has...
think
of
the
case
of
the
insider
for
the
company
itself,
the
company
that's
going
to
take
over
another
company.
everybody
knows
that
those
insiders
shouldn't
go
out
and
buy
up
stock
in
the
takeover
target
secretly,
and
it
deceives
everybody
in
the
company
for
which
he
works.
so
the
sec,
the
expert
organization,
decides
that
that's
so.
it
fits
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
then
of
course
you
would
be
worried
about
criminal
liability
for
vague
theories,
but
that's
where
i
came
back
to
the
word
willfully.
so
i'm
really
asking
this
to
see
if
there's
anything
more
you
want
to
say
in
that
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
i
see
it
as
a
delegation
problem,
an
expert
agency,
literal
language
complied
with,
and
criminal
liability
taken...
unfair
criminal
liability
taken
care
of
by
willfully?
i'm
sketching
that
out
for
you
so
that
i
can
get
it--
