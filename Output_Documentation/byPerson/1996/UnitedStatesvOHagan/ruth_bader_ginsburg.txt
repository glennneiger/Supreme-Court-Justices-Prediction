i
thought
that
was
what
you
answered
justice
scalia
when
he
asked
the
question.
yes,
that's
what
i
thought,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
but
there
would
be
in
that
case
other
sanctions
immediately.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
told
the
law
firm,
look,
i'm
going
to
do
this,
the
law
firm
isn't
going
to
consent
but
it's
not
likely
he'll
retain
his
job,
and
there
might
be
other
sanctions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
respect
to
the
tip,
i
wasn't
quite
sure
of
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
when
she
brought
up
the
child.
were
you
responding
to
her
word
inadvertent,
because
if
this
parent
tipped
off
the
child
and
told
the
child
to
purchase
the
security,
surely
there
would
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--responsibility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
french,
you
would
give
a
different
answer,
would
you
not,
if
the
lawyer
were
in
the
firm
that
was
assisting
pillsbury
in
this
matter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
two
lawyers,
both
with
the
same
information,
but
one
is
working
for
the
target
company
and
the
other
is
working
for
the
potential
takeover
company,
and
you
would
distinguish
those
two
cases.
so
everything
that
you
said
in
the
beginning,
if
we
just
made
one
change,
made
o'hagan
with
the
firm
that's
representing
pillsbury,
there
would
be
liability
and
you
wouldn't
contest
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
french,
would
you
tell
me,
if
your
position
is
the
one
we
adopt,
what
becomes
of
the
1988
legislation
that
provides...
provided
for
a
private
right
of
action?
it
appeared
that
congress
was
operating
on
the
basis
of
certain
understandings
about
what
10(b)
and
14(e)
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
i
don't
mean
with
respect
to
your
case,
but
you're
asking
us
to
make
a
ruling
that
will
govern
not
simply
this
day
and
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
will
interpret
10(b)
and
14(e),
and
so
i
would
like
to
know
what
becomes
of
that
later
legislation.
is
it
in
shambles?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
disagree
with
what
one
of
the
amici
briefs
said,
that...
i
think
it
was
the
one
from
the
nasaa...
stated
that
you
virtually
conceded
that
o'hagan's
conduct
would
have
violated
the
1988
act
if
it
had
post-dated
that
legislation.
