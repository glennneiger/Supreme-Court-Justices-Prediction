we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-842,
united
states
v.
james
herman
o'hagan.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
dreeben,
where
is...
the
thing
that
bothers
me
about
the
case
here
is,
where
is
the
connection
between
the
deceptive
device
and
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
didn't
deceive
anyone
who
sold
him
securities.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
think
of
fraud
being
practiced
on
a
person
who
is
damaged
by
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
rather
unusual,
for
a
criminal
statute
to
be
that
open-ended,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
i
agree
with
you
on
that
point,
at
least
as
to
the...
the
wall
street
journal
in
carpenter
was
said
to
have
a
property
interest
in
the
confidentiality,
or
in
the
use
of
the
notes
for
the
column.
here,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
property
interest
involved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
omitted
one
little
part
there
from
that
sentence,
mr.
dreeben...
designed
to
prevent
such
acts
and
practices
as
are
fraudulent,
deceptive,
or
manipulative.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
seems
to
me
one
could
read
that
as
saying
that
that
does
not
give
the
sec
authority
to
define
what
is
fraudulent,
what
is
deceptive
or
manipulative,
but
simply
to
define
practices
which
are
in
fact
fraudulent,
and
you
can't
expand
on
the
definition
of
fraudulent
or
deceptive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
french,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
carpenter
case,
mr.
french?
what
about
the
carpenter
case?
i
mean,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
theft
can
be
brought
within
the
securities
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
french,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
a
little
over
a
minute
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
the
case
is
submitted.
