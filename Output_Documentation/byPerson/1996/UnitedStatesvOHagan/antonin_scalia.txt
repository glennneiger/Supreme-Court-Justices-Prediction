justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
just
by
misappropriating?
i
mean,
suppose
the
defendant
here
had
instead
come
clean,
and
he
told
his
superiors
in
the
law
firm
that
he
was
going
to
use
this
information.
then
he
would
not
be
posing
as
a
loyal
employee
any
more,
and
it
would
have
been
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
he
would
still
have
breached
the
securities
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
the
line.
he
didn't
tell
them
that
he
was
going
to
go
out
and
use
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
any,
any
fraud
is
deception,
then.
i
assume
that,
you
know,
if
a
lawyer
takes
the
client's
money
that's
supposed
to
be
in
a
trust
account
and
just
removes
it
posing
as
an
honest
lawyer,
i
mean,
you
know,
everybody
who
commits
any
fraud
is
guilty
of
deception.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
appropriate
some
of
my
client's
money
in
order
to
buy
stock?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
i
violated
the
securities
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
isn't
that
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
security
just
as
much
as
this
one
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
same
here.
i
didn't
have
the
money.
the
only
way
i
could
buy
this
stock
was
to
get
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
got
the
money
posing
as
an
honest
lawyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
are
you
basing
your--
--deceive
the
sellers
not
just
deceive
somebody
who's
working
for
the...
for...
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
basis
for
the
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
entirely
disconnected.
the
trade
press
would
only
be
interested
in
it
because
the
people
who
read
the
trade
press
would
be
able
to
buy
securities
on
the
basis
of
this
confidential
information.
i
doubt
if
they
would
have--
--they
would
have
just
pushed
it
one
step
further
back,
but
it
still
necessarily--
--they
wouldn't
have
paid
this
kind
of
price
for
it,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
their
rulemaking
authority
under
the
law
allows
them
to
go
beyond
the
law.
it
allows
them
to
make
rules
that
will
prevent
a
violation
of
the
law.
you
concede
that
that
allows
them
to
make
unlawful
by
rule
some
things
that
are
not
made
unlawful
by
the
statute,
don't
you?
or
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
beyond
that,
it's
not
transforming
fraud
into
nonfraud.
it's
saying,
this
is
nonfraud.
it's
not
covered
by
the
statute,
but
we're
prohibiting
it
nonetheless
because
the
statute
allows
us
to
do
it.
it
allows
us
to
prohibit
things
in
order
to
prevent
fraud,
not
just
to
prohibit
fraud
but
to
prohibit
other
things
in
order
to
prevent
fraud.
that's
how
the
statute
reads.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
point
you're
making.
you
are
making
the
point
that
this
rule
might
have
been
okay
if
it
had
read
differently,
if
it
had
read,
thou
shalt
not
do
this.
instead,
however,
it
reads
doing
this
constitutes
fraud
under
the...
under
14(e),
and
that's
simply
false,
so
the
rule
is
false.
it's
not
that
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
that
it
does
something
that
the
commission
couldn't.
it
does
it
in
the
wrong
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
french,
does
the
federal
trade
commission
act
say
that
the
federal
trade
commission
shall,
by
rules
and
regulations,
define
and
prescribe
means
reasonably
designed
to
prevent
unfair
or
deceptive
trade
practices.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
does.
that's
the
crucial
sentence
here
which
allows
this
agency,
as
i
think
the
federal
trade
commission
act
does
not
allow
the
federal
trade
commission
to
go
beyond
what
the
statute
says
and
to
define
other
things
as
unlawful
in
order
to
prevent
the
things
that
the
statute
prohibits.
i
think
that's
the
fair
meaning
of
that
sentence,
now.
maybe
you
say
that's
an
unconstitutional
delegation
or
something,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
grapple
with
the
reality
that
congress
has
told
this
agency,
you
can
make
unlawful
things
that
the
statute
does
not
make
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
i
hate
to
use
up
any
of
your
short
time,
but
there's
a
new
point
which
came
out
in
oral
argument
here
which
i
don't
recall
in
the
briefs,
and
i
want
to
know
what
your
response
to
it
is,
and
that
is,
assuming
that
14(e),
as
i
think
is
true,
does
allow
this
agency
to
make
unlawful
things
that
the
statute
itself
does
not,
has
it
purported
to
do
that
in
its
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
has
not
purported
to
do
that,
has
not
purported
by
that
regulation
to
prescribe
means
reasonably
designed,
but
rather
in
its
regulation
simply
redefines
what
constitutes
fraud
or
deception,
then
is
that
an
exercise
of
the
power
that's
given
by
that
second
sentence
of
14(e)?
