justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
dreeben?
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
your
statement
that...
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
that
if
the
defendant
here
had
disclosed
to
his
partners,
that
would
have
avoided
liability,
and
you're
suggesting
there
was
therefore
no
duty
to
disclose
to
the
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
in
this
case
he
had
disclosed
to
his
partner,
and
his
partner
had
just
kept
the
information
to
himself,
and
then
he
had
gone...
the
defendant
had
gone
ahead
with
his
trading.
would
there
be
a
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
you
then
would
have
said
there
was
a
breach
of
the
firm's
duty
to
the
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
french,
i
gather
you're
trying
to
convince
us
that
the
doctrine
would
apply
even
if
all
the
relevant
information
were
in
the
public
domain,
and
i'm
assuming
that
we
have
a
case
that
the
jury
found
the
relevant
information
was
not
in
the
public
domain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
it's
grotesque,
as
i
understand
your
presentation,
is
because
the
relevant
information
was
in
the
public
domain
at
the
time
he
made
his
purchases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
i
would
like
to
try
and
address
the
question
of
what
we
do
with
a
case
in
which
the
facts
are
the
way
the
government
presents
them
and
the
way
presumably
the
jury
thought
they
were,
namely
that
your
client
acted
entirely
on
the
basis
of
inside
information
that
was
not
in
the
public
domain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
that
connection
i'd
be
curious
to
know
your
view
on
whether,
if
it
was...
instead
of
your
client,
if
it
had
been
the
partner
who
was
in
charge
of
the
matter
within
the
firm
who
had
done
this,
would
you
say
he
would
also
be...
would
he
be
covered
or
not,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm...
my
question
is,
what
if
he
had
been
the
partner
in
charge
of
the
matter
within
the
firm,
and
had
acted
entirely
on
the
basis
of
nonpublic
information.
could
the
statute
apply
in
that
situation,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
this
man
were
the
only
lawyer
working
on
the
matter
in
the
firm
for
the
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
had
a
clear
duty
to
his
client
not
to
disclose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
really
understand
your
response.
if
it
authorizes
them
to
go
beyond
the
law...
you
mean
only
for
civil
purposes?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
