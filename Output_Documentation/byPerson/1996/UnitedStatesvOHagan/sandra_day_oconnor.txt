well,
mr.
dreeben,
then
if
someone
stole
the
lawyer's
briefcase
and
discovered
the
information
and
traded
on
it,
no
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
a
partner
perhaps
in
the
law
firm,
the
lawyer
let
his
daughter
know
about
the
planned
merger
inadvertently
and
the
daughter
relied
on
the
information
and
bought
stock
options,
violation?
the
daughter
has
no
obligation
to
disclose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dreeben--
--now,
mr.
dreeben,
we...
this
court
has
always
required
either
a
misrepresentation
or
an
omission
to
find
10(b)
liability,
i
think,
and
you
say
there
was
an
omission
here
by
the
failure
to
disclose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--let
me
ask
you
whether
you
think
section
14(e)
provides
you
with
an
easier
argument
for
liability
than
10(b).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except,
now,
the
schreiber
case
indicated
that
the
sec
can't
define
offensive
conduct
more
broadly
than
the
statute
provides.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
certainly
is
language
in
that
opinion.
i
think
footnote
11
indicates
that
sec
can't
go
more
broadly
than
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
10(e)
perhaps
does
not
require
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
or
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
10(e),
liability
under...
excuse
me,--
--14.
14(e).
does
that
require
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
would
extend
liability
to
the
thief?
