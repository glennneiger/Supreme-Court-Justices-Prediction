mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whatever
one
thinks
of
abortion,
this
court
in
both
bray
and
casey
has
recognized
that
there
are
common
and
respectable
reasons
for
opposing
it.
we
are
not
here
challenging
the
prohibitions
of
the
injunction
which
prohibit
blockades,
trespass,
or
obstruction
of
access.
in
the
western
district
of
new
york,
the
opposition
to
abortion
with
which
we
are
concerned
involves
demonstrations
such
as
picketing,
leafleting,
the
holding
of
a
sign,
or
a
prayer
vigil.
under
the
one-size-fits-all
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court,
the
petitioners
are
prohibited
from
engaging
in
these
form
of
demonstrations
inside
overlapping
speech-free
zones
that
float
without
geographic
limitation.
the
injunction
also
allows,
to
a
very
limited
extent,
a
form
of
demonstration
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
justice--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
other
provision
of
the
injunction
that
we
are
challenging
involves
a
sidewalk
counseling
allowance.
it
allows
sidewalk
counseling.
however,
that
sidewalk
counseling
can
be
terminated
based
on
facial
gestures.
in
other
words,
what
we
call
and
the
lower
courts
recognized
as
a
cease-and-desist
provision.
this
provision
of
the
injunction
is
implemented
on
verbal
or
nonverbal
indications.
in
fact,
the
injunction
itself
prohibits
and
allows
for...
prohibits
any
person
being
approached.
it's
not
just
limited
to
women
seeking
the
services
of
an
abortion
facility.
on
page
183
of
the
petition
appendix--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--no,
justice
scalia,
we
would
not.
that
would
be
certainly
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
the
aclu
in
their
brief
has
acknowledged
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that
is
not.
we
think
that
the
no
consent,
and
that's
what
this
is,
without
consent,
the
speech
stops,
and
that
could
be
before
a
word
is
even
uttered,
and
we
think
that
provision
of
the
injunction,
like
the
no
approach
zone
in
madsen,
because
it
is
dependent
upon
consent
of
the
people
speaking
and
the
people
that
are
listening,
therefore
it
is
unconstitutional,
because
without
a
doubt
it
burdens
more
speech
than
necessary
to
serve
any
of
these
purposes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
chief
justice
certainly
said
that.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
we're
in
the--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
breyer,
i
think
that
in
reality
we're
talking
about,
of
course,
in
buffalo
city
sidewalks
and
city
streets,
with
sidewalk
escorts
trying
to
get
people
into
the
clinic.
it's
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
any
metropolitan
area,
and
to
carry
on
intimate
conversation,
one-on-one
communication
with
a
desire
to
dissuade,
to
tell
someone
we
really
don't
you...
want
you
to
go
into
this
particular
abortion
facility.
that
is
intimate
conversation.
sure,
you
could
be
15
feet
away,
but
in
that
15
feet,
if
you
were
to
ask
me,
as
a
demonstrator,
if
i
was
the
demonstrator,
you
wanted
some
information,
under
this
injunction
consensual
speech
is
also
prohibited,
and
that's
where
i
think,
if
we
look
at
the
burdening-no-more-speech-than-necessary
standard,
why
is
it
that
15
feet
serves
as
a
standard,
especially--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
don't
think
so
in
the
particular
situation
here.
if
there
is--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--two
feet
i
think
would
approach
what
we
would
consider
probably
blocking,
certainly
crowding,
and
crowding
is
prohibited
by
section
1(c)
of
the
injunction
and
we're
not
challenging
that,
but
crowding
in
the
sense
that
if
i
were
blocking
your
access.
one
of
the
examples
that
we
use,
and
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
contempt
proceedings...
it's
found
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page...
beginning...
commencing
on
page
101,
actually
102
going
forward.
bonnie
behn
and
carla
rainero
were
engaged
in
sidewalk
counseling.
they
were
held
in
contempt.
the
court
held
them
in
contempt.
on
page
107
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
describing
what
exactly
was
taking
place,
and
then
going
on
to
page
108,
and
i'll
refer
to
page
108,
bonnie
behn
and
carla
rainero
walked
alongside
the
young
woman,
her
companions
and
the
escorts,
and
continued
talking
to
the
young
woman.
they
were
engaged
in
a
conversation.
now,
ultimately,
the
woman
in
that
particular
case
that
was
seeking
the
abortion
said,
please
stop
talking.
there's
no
finding
of
yelling,
no
finding
of
blockades,
no
finding
of
impeding
access.
she
just
said,
stop
talking.
the
two
individuals,
carla
rainero
and
bonnie
behn,
continued
to
communicate,
and
for
that
the
court
held
them,
the
district
court
held
them
in
contempt,
because
the
injunction
itself
prohibits
that
type
of
speech
on
a
public
sidewalk
in
new
york
absent
evidence
of
yelling,
absent
evidence
of
blockades.
that
information
or
that
concern
is
handled
by
the
injunction,
as
is
the
noise
restrictions.
we're
not
challenging
those.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
oh,
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
prohibition
that
we're
concerned
with.
the
noise
provision,
justice
scalia,
excessively
loud
noise
to
be
heard
inside--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no.
i
think
that's
robust
speech,
and
this
court
has
talked
about
the
need
to
protect
robust
speech
in
public
forums.
this
is
clearly
a
public
forum.
the
fact
that
these
sidewalks
abut
an
abortion
clinic
does
not
mean
that
they
become
enclaves
immune
from
the
first
amendment.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
we
are
challenging
that
as
well.
justice
o'connor,
the
way
that
these
zones
work
in
operation,
you
have,
as
you
acknowledge,
the
15-foot
fixed
zone,
which
actually
is
really
45
feet,
because
as
an
individual
approaches
the
clinic
their
bubble
zone,
their
floating
zone
goes
with
them.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
fixed
buffer
zone
in
and
of
itself,
justice
o'connor,
we
are
challenging.
two
reasons.
number
1,
the
court
here,
before...
when
it
issued
the
temporary
restraining
order
had
a
speech-restrictive
provision
initially.
i
think
what
this
court
said
in
madsen
as
it
relates
to
the
entire
issue
of
was
there
a...
before
a
broader
injunction
is
issued,
is
there
a
least
restrictive
or
less
restrictive
injunction
that
just
didn't
do
the
job,
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
facts
here.
the
reality
is
that
the
injunction
had
a
speech
restriction
at
the
outset.
then
the
court
increased
that
speech
restriction
in
the
final...
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that
is
our
position,
and
i
think
the
record
in
that
sense
shows
it,
because
there
would
have
been
six
contempts,
or
actually
seven
contempt
actions
brought
in
an
almost
18-month
period,
three
of
them
involving
cease
and
desist...
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct,
and
we've
acknowledged,
and
they're
in
the
joint
appendix,
there
are
also
contempt
actions
that
have
been
filed.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
what
it's
talking
about
there
in
the
particular
page
a-57,
the
way
we
understand
the
evidence
was
submitted
at
trial
and
the
way
we've
seen
the
case
was,
this
was
not
a
mass
blockade,
and
what
we
were
talking
about
in
our
reply
brief,
justice
ginsburg,
is,
this
is
not
a
case
involving
mass
blockades.
there
have
been
occasions
where
protesters
have
trespassed,
and
we
believe--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
that
the
court
should
only
be
looking
at
this
particular
injunction
in
light
of
the
facts
that
the
district
court
have.
was
the
injunction
that
was
issued,
justice
kennedy,
then,
the
question
that
we
would
submit
is,
did
it
burden
more
speech
than
necessary,
and
the
provisions
that
we're
challenging...
we're
not
saying
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
say,
as
the
court
did...
it
increased
the...
under
provision
1(c)
from
the
tro
to
the
preliminary
injunction,
it
did
increase
things
such
as
no
touching,
no
physical
contact.
we're
not
challenging
that.
but
there's
nothing
that
justifies
the
speech-free
zones
that
float
without
any
geographic
limitation,
and
speech
can
be
silenced
on
command.
justice
scalia.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
actually,
the--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
scalia,
actually
it
was
the
floating
zone
was
in
the
tro.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
the
fixed
zone
came
afterwards,
and
i
think
that
points
to
the
nature
of
what
took
place
here,
so
we
have
these
automatic
floating
zones,
if
you
will,
without
geographic
limitation,
and
then
a
15-foot
zone
is
imposed,
and
we
would--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--and
that
is
our
contention,
and
also--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--right.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
justice
ginsburg,
if
it
is
working
but
infringes
on
free
speech
at
the
same
time--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
precisely.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
we
have
not
challenged,
nor
are
we
here
challenging
the
restrictions
other
than
the
two
speech
provisions,
but
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledge,
and
it's
on
a-8
of
the
petition
appendix,
that
the
demonstrations
are
mostly
peaceful
in
nature.
twelve
judges
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
stated
that
in
fact
this
was
very
different
record
than
in
madsen.
and
in
madsen,
this
court
held
that
in
fact
the
issue
of
a
fixed
zone
was
debatable.
we
think
the
debate
should
tip
in
favor
of
free
speech
here,
especially
since
this
court
in
madsen
said
that
precision
of
regulation
is
required,
couched
in
the
narrowest
possible
terms.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes,
and
this
court,
in
looking
at
the...
in
giving
some
deference
to
the
trial
court
struck
down
the
no-approach
zone
in
madsen
and
also
declared
that
a
portion
of
the
36-foot
zone
burdened
more
speech
than
necessary.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
precisely
our
point,
that
the
pinpoint
precision
that
this
court
talked
about
in
madsen
is
absent
here.
this
is
a
one...
this
injunction
applies
to
every
single
facility
where
abortions
are
performed
in
the
western
district
of
new
york,
and
it
is
one
size
fits
all.
they
did
not
carve
it
to
specific
needs,
and
we
think
a
floating
zone
is
not
justified
anyways,
and
a
cease-and-desist
provision--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
it
would
be
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment.
i
don't
think
we
can
say--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--there
are
times,
justice
stevens,
where
floating
zones
have
been
adopted
in
domestic
violence
situations
where...
of
course,
that's
not
involving
speech.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
right.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
i
think
on
a
public
sidewalk
or
a
public
street
we're
going
to
hear
messages
we
may
not
like,
we
may
disagree
with,
but
it
can--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--by
one
person
to
the
same
person.
could
that
approach
harassment?
maybe
it
could.
however--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
don't
think
that
necessarily
that
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
in
the
context
of
robust
debate
on
a
public
issue
like
this,
there
is
going
to
be
a
variety
of
speech.
this
injunction,
though,
which
is
interesting,
prohibits
a
person
from...
a
demonstrator
from
approaching
anyone.
in
fact,
interestingly,
this
injunction
does
not
limit
its
impact
to
women
seeking
the
services
of
an
abortion
clinic,
or
physicians
and
staff.
it
applies
to
any
person
seeking
access,
and
provision
1(c),
the
no
approach
zone,
it's
similar
to
the
no-approach
zone.
it's
the
cease-and-desist
provision,
says
on
its
face...
i
mean,
it's
very
clear
that
a
person
or
a
group
of
persons
can
prohibit,
or
use
the
provision
and
prohibit
speech.
how
does
a
group
of
persons
do
that?
is
it
one
individual
wants
to
hear
a
message,
the
other
does
not?
what
happens
if--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
the
stalker
laws
are
different
in
that
regard.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
because
the
persistence
is
not
necessarily,
number
1,
protected
speech.
there's
a
number
of
issues.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
at
some
point
that
crosses
the
line
from
speech
to
harassment.
we've
looked
at
that
issue.
is
there
a
way
to
prohibit
one-on-one
persistent
speech
on
a
public
forum?
i
have
trouble
with
that,
because
i
think
it
leads
to
a
dangerous
provision,
but
if
there
was
harassment,
you
had...
we
have
the
case
in
the
second
circuit
involving
ms.
onassis,
and
there
the
court
said
that
a
zone
was
appropriate.
but
of
course,
there
the
court
out
the
zone.
i
also
think--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--it
does
not.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
correct.
it
is
targeted
directly
at
speech.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
it's
a
different
scenario.
it's
the
purpose
of
the
communication,
but--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--no,
i
think
not,
justice
stevens,
with
respect,
for
two
reasons.
number
1...
and
i
want
to
draw
an
analysis,
if
i
could.
in
naacp
v.
claiborne
hardware,
one
of
the
most
effective
tools
for
the
civil
rights
protestors
was
the
stationing
of
sidewalk-based
store
watchers.
they
were
sometimes
called
deacons,
sometimes
called
black
hats.
and
the
court
acknowledged...
this
court
acknowledged
that,
as
the
lower
courts
found,
that
the
volition
of
many
black
citizens
were
just
overcome
by
sheer
fear
because
the
presence
of
these
black
hats
was
so
strong
and
it
was
intimidating,
but
the
court
still
said
that
that
was
protected
speech,
and
the
fact
that
here
the
speech
is
vigorous,
and
it's
about
an
issue
that
is
part
of
a
debate,
doesn't
entitle
it
to
less
constitutional
protection,
or
alternatively
protecting
platitude.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think,
justice
breyer,
all
of
the
above.
i
think
someone
that
is
on
the
streets
of
new
york
that
wants
to
talk
to
a
woman
who
is
about
to
engage
in
an
abortion
procedure,
or
for
that
matter
a
salesman
who
does
business
with
this
abortion
facility,
wants
to
communicate
a
message
one-on-one,
maybe
wanting
to
share,
as
the
records
happen
in
this
case,
a
bible
verse.
it's
hard
to
show
someone
a
bible
15
feet
away.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
actually,
there's
no
demonstration
allowed
within
the
15-foot
zones
at
all.
the
only
carve-out
is
the
sidewalk
counseling,
which
is
the
distribution
of
literature,
according
to
the
lower
court,
to
dissuade
someone
from
not
having
an
abortion
based
on
a
particular
statement,
and
then,
of
course,
the
cease-and-desist
language
comes
in.
but
if
someone
were
simply
holding
a
sign,
or
handing
a
religious
tract,
or
simply
trying
to
show
a
bible
to
someone,
they
cannot
do
it,
and
in
the
decorum
of
this
courtroom,
it's
quite
easy
for
you
and
i
to
communicate.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
the
counselor
could.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
unless,
of
course,
somebody
in
that
group
says,
get
away.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
i
don't
think
that's...
i
don't
think
that's
what
i'm
saying,
justice
stevens.
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
bible
itself
may
not
be
deemed
a
form
of
demonstrating...
a
form
of
sidewalk
counseling.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
it's
more
than
print.
i
think
it's
the
communication
and
the
print.
i
think
if
someone
wearing
a
button
that
makes
a
statement,
a
religious
statement,
or
a
sentiment,
that
person--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
have
something
they
couldn't
read,
it's
hard
to
shout
over
sidewalk
counselors,
the
lower
courts
acknowledge
that
the
sidewalk
counselors,
the
escorts,
rather,
trying
to
get
these
women
in
the
clinic
create
an
increased
atmosphere,
it's
noisy,
and
it's
hard
to
communicate.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
sidewalk
counselors,
yes,
justice.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
escorts.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
precisely,
and
in
that
nature
would
also
inform
these
women
about
their
rights
under
the
injunction,
would
encourage
them
to
engage
in
a
communication
to
stop
the
communication,
they
would
surround
them...
this
was
not,
as
i
said,
courtroom
decorum
discussion.
this
is
discussion
on
a
street
where
there's
people
on
both
sides
of
the
issue.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
would
be
like--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--my
response
was,
justice
stevens,
that
justice
breyer
and
justice
scalia
were
asking
about
the
issue
of
communicating
a
message.
it's
difficult
to
communicate
a
message
on
a
public
sidewalk.
how
does
one
hand
someone
a
leaflet
15
feet
away
when
this
court
recognized
that
one
need
not
ponder
the
contents
of
a
leaflet
to
mechanically
take
it
out
of
someone's
hand.
you
can't
take
it
unless
you
have
an
awfully
long
hand.
you
can't
take
it
out
of
someone's
hand--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--but
i
think
the
point
is,
justice
o'connor,
that
15
feet
away
on
a
city
street
in
buffalo,
new
york,
is
not
this
courtroom,
and
i
cannot
just
hand
the
leaflet,
and
i
think
i
have
the
right--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--excuse
me?
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
woman
can
say
no,
which
we
think
the
consent
provision
alone
is
the
reason
this
provision
of
the
injunction
should
be
declared
to
burden
more
speech
than
necessary
and
therefore
unconstitutional,
but
that's
one--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that
is
correct.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think,
though,
the
way
to...
if
someone
pushes,
if
someone
grabs,
if
someone
crowds
so
that
someone
can't
move
forward,
there's
provisions
of
the
injunction
that
cover
that,
and
they
should
be
prosecuted
for
contempt.
i
don't
think
to
limit
speech,
including
prohibiting
demonstrations
completely...
i
mean,
under--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
souter--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
don't
think
it
is
in
this
regard.
the
court
tailored
its
injunction,
or
attempted
to
tailor
its
injunction
to
say
no
grabbing,
no
physical
abuse.
we're
not
challenging
that,
but
this
injunction
itself
says,
no--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
they
made
that
argument.
that
was
one
of
the--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--public
access
was
one
of
the
concerns
that
the
court
raised.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
i
think--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
no.
it
has
to
be
tailored
specifically
to
what's
taking
place,
and
i
think
that
precision
of
regulation
is
the
standard,
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--you
know,
that's
interesting.
it
doesn't
prohibit
standing.
it
doesn't
prohibit--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
you
know,
it
says
that
no
demonstrator
shall
physically
abuse,
grab,
or
touch,
but
i
mean--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's...
that
is
how
i
think
this
injunction
can
be
read,
and
that's,
i
think,
again--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--no,
there
isn't,
but
i
think...
i
think
that--
[laughter]
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
not
in
this
context.
i
think
yes,
they
can
go
together
in
the
sense,
is
there
a
need
for
an
injunction
of
some
type?
the
answer,
yes.
we're
not
challenging
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
however,
does
that
mean
that
demonstrations,
the
holding
of
a
sign,
the
wearing
of
a
button
within
15
foot,
15
feet
of
an
individual,
any
person
seeking
access,
is
constitutional,
and
we
think
not.
it
has
to
burden
more
speech
than
necessary.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
there
was
a
concession,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
district
court
regarding
the
nature
of
the
evidence,
and
it
simplified
in
a
pretty
real
way,
and
a
not
necessarily
beneficial
one,
it
simplified
the
evidence
that
was
presented.
it
does
not
change
the
nature
of
what's
being
challenged
here,
though.
we're
not
saying
that
an
injunction
should
not
be
issued.
we're
not
saying
it
applies
to
one
person
and
not
the
other.
we're
saying
that
any
demonstrator
is
prohibited
from
demonstrating
within
a
15-foot
zone
and
a
floating
zone
that
goes
without
geographic
limitation
whatsoever.
no
geographic
limitation
of
this
zone.
it
just
floats,
and
we
think
that
burdens
more
speech
than
necessary,
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
found
that...
we
found
that
fascinating,
too.
the
court
said,
my
gosh,
it
would
be
impractical.
in
fact,
it
says...
it
goes
further.
he
said,
no
one
would
know
how
to
comply
with
the
floating
zone,
but
then
he
acknowledges
it's
floating,
and
the
second
circuit
acknowledges
it's
floating,
so
maybe
the
judge
at
the
district
court
level
forgot
what
he
meant,
i
don't
know,
but
it
burdens
more
speech
than
necessary
because
it
does
exactly
what
the
judge
was
concerned
about.
how
does
one
know
when
to
back
off?
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes,
it
was.
it
was
raised
below,
and
it
was
rejected.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
i
think
we're
beyond
that
point.
i
think
that
at
this
point...
we
thought
it
was
a
valid
issue.
it's
not
part
of
the
cert
petition
in
that
sense.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
actually,
what
general
dellinger
was
referring
to
on
page
29
says
that
the
scope
of
the
injunction
and
these
injunction
floating
zones
do
float
without
geographic
limitation.
it
says
that
they
are
structured
to
protect
the
rights
of
all
party
and
directed
to
the
activities
at
the
site
chosen
for
demonstration.
anyplace
these
individuals
are
demonstrating
is
the
site
chosen
for
demonstration.
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument
and
the
respondents',
there
is
now
a
medical
exception
to
the
first
amendment.
this
court
in
madsen
dealt
with
evidence
that
came
to
the
same
conclusions
regarding
increased
stress.
despite
that
increased
stress,
the
no-approach
zone
was
still
deemed
to
burden
more
speech
than
necessary.
if
the
owner
of
claiborne
hardware
had
a
heart
condition,
would
he
now
say,
get
these
protesters
away
from
the
front
of
my
store
because
i've
got
a
heart
condition
that's
going
to
be
aggravated
when
i
go
in
there,
and
i
think
the
answer
has
to
be
no
to
that,
that...
the
owner
of
a
fur
store
is
aggravated
because
there's
animal
rights
protesters
out
there
picketing.
i
think
these
are
the
types
of
things
which
is
part
of
our
free
debate.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
certainly
our
position
of
it,
and
that
is
exactly
correct,
and
those
verbs
might
be
aggressive
advocacy,
and
i
think
it's
also
important--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--not
these
clients.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
they
do
use
words,
but
it's
interesting,
those
words
under
this
injunction,
if
they
were
directed
at,
say,
a
xerox
salesman
who
was
doing
business
with
the
abortion
facility
and
a
demonstrator
were
to
try
to
approach
him
and
say,
please
don't
do
business
with
this
facility
because
they're
engaged
in
a
practice
that
we
personally
find
abhorrent.
that
xerox
salesman...
not
just
the
woman
seeking
abortion...
that
xerox
salesman
has
the
advantage
of
this
injunction.
on
page
183,
it
says
it
applies
to
any
person
seeking
access.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
i
think
that's
actually
prohibited
by
the
injunction
that
we're
not
challenging,
screaming
in
someone's
face
to
the
point
where--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--and
i
think
that's
why
section
1(c),
justice
breyer,
prohibits
crowding,
and
we're
not
challenging
that.
but
this
injunction
on
the
cease-and-desist
provision
on
paragraph
1(c)
says
that
it
can
be
imposed
by
any
person
or
any
group
of
persons,
so
a
group
of
persons
are
entering
the
abortion
facility,
the
woman
seeking
the
abortion
wants
to
get
the
information,
wants
to
talk
to
the
sidewalk
counselor,
but
the
companion
says
no.
under
this
injunction,
under
section
(c),
1(c),
the
cease-and-desist
provision
is
implicated.
that's
the
way
it's
drafted.
that
burdens
more
speech
than
necessary.
the
citation,
and
it's
consistent
in
the
briefs,
we
think
it
just
misses
the
mark,
and
that
is
the
beth
israel
hospital
v.
nrlb
did
not
say
you
can't
distribute
literature
inside
a
hospital.
it
said
that...
which
by
the
way,
of
course,
as
this
court
knows,
nlrb
was
not
a
first
amendment
case,
but
it
overturned
a
prohibition
on
leafleting
and
solicitation
in
the
cafeteria
and
in
the
lunchroom
in
a
private
hospital
where
patients
did
gather
on
occasion,
so--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--your
honor,
i
was
referring
to
the
reply
brief,
the
attachment
at
appendix
a-3.
