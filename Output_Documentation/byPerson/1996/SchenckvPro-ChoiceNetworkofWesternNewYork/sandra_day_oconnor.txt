--well,
are
you
challenging
the
fixed
15-foot
limit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
talking
about
the
floating
bubble,
i'm
talking
about
the
fixed
buffer
zone
provision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
can
offer
it,
presumably,
at
the
15-foot
boundary
and
say,
here,
i'd
like
you
to
take
this
to
read
it.
the
person
can
refuse,
and
if
you
were
closer
and
offer
a
leaflet,
the
person
can
refuse.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--did
madsen
suggest
that
there
has
to
be
some
underlying
violation
of
statutory
or
common
law
to
support
a
preliminary
injunction
burdening
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
what
is
it
here
that
you
rely
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
claim
under
section
1985(3)
was
dismissed
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
there
be
trespass
on
a
public
street
or
sidewalk,
or
would
that
just
apply
to
the
property
of
the
clinic?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
madsen
state
that
the
consent
requirement
alone
invalidated
the
no-approach
provision
in
that
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
are
you
asking
that
we
ignore
that
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
we
had
to...
the
court
had
to
find
some
violation
of
statutory
or
common
law
to
justify
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
don't
know
what
this
argument
does
to
bolster
that.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
theory
of
a
violation
of
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
the
preliminary
injunction
could
be
based
solely
on
testimony
of
an
expert--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
this
social
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
effectively
prevented
people
from
entering
a
restaurant,
or
what
have
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
there
were
something
like
five
episodes
over
18
months.
