you'd
be
content
if
we
modified
that
so
only
verbal
indications
would
suffice?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
not
really
what
you're
after
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yelling.
you
would
accept
this
injunction
if
it
prevented
you
from
raising
your
voice
to
anyone
going
into
the
clinic?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
be
heard
inside.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
this
injunction
would
be
okay
if
it
prevented
the
counselors
from
shouting
at
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
15-foot...
not
the
floating
zone,
but
the
15-foot
absolute,
that
was
in
the
tro
originally.
that
wasn't
added.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
that
in
the
original
tro
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
meskill
says
on
a-57,
after
noting
that
there
were
these
two
violations
after
the
tro,
he
says,
however,
the
supreme
court's
first
amendment
jurisprudence
clearly
requires
more
than
two
isolated
incidents
over
the
course
of
1-1/2
years
before
a
court
may
banish
an
entire
protest
demonstration
from
a
given
area,
and
that's
your
contention
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
injunction
doesn't
prohibit
following,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
prohibits
speaking.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
feel
differently
about
an
injunction
that
prohibited
following.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understood
from
the
record
that
the...
whatever
you
call
them,
the
antiabortion
people
had
people
called
sidewalk
counselors--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
clinics
had
people
who
were
meant
to
counter
the
sidewalk
counselors.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
would
surround
the
person
coming
in
and
talk
about
everything
and
anything,
make
noise,
which
made
it
quite
difficult
to
speak
to
that
person
from
15
feet.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sekulow,
can
you
enter
the
15-foot
zone,
crowd,
and
even
grab,
so
long
as
you
don't
try
to
talk?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
long
as
you
don't
have
a
poster,
and
so
long
as
you
don't
try
to
talk
to
the
person,
you
can
get
within
the
15
feet,
grab,
crowd,
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
15-foot
zone
does
not
apply
to
someone
who
is
not
trying
to
communicate.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
requiring
people
to
speak
from
a
distance
of
15
feet--
justice
antonin
scalia
--instead
of
coming
up
close,
does
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--make
the
zone
quieter
or
noisier?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
any
traffic
and
without
any
opposing
escort.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
reason...
the
reason
we
struck
down
the
uninvited
approach
provision
in
madsen
is
as
follows,
quoting
from
boos
v.
barry:
as
a
general
matter,
we
have
indicated
that
in
public
debate
our
own
citizens
must
tolerate
insulting
and
even
outrageous
speech
in
order
to
provide
adequate
breathing
space
to
the
freedoms
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
if
you
apply
that
same
statement
to...
to
what...
unwanted
speech
just
as
we
applied
it
to
uninvited
speech,
it
seems
to
me
you
get
the
same
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
medical
evidence
that
the
forced
physical--
justice
antonin
scalia
--proximity...
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
did
studies
on
forced
physical
proximity,
and
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even...
regarding...
you're
not
contending
that
the
provisions
of
the
injunction
do
not
have
to
be
designed
to
prevent
a
violation
of
the
law,
as
opposed
to
prevent
the
kind
of
emotional
upset
that
your
expert
testimony
related
to.
you
still
acknowledge
that
the
provisions
of
the
injunction
must
be
ordinated
to
preventing
a
violation
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
state
law
is
being
violated?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
only
in
the
context
of
keeping
the
noise
down
outside
the
hospital
which
could
be
heard
inside.
we
studiously
avoided
using
that
as
a
basis
for
validating
any
of
the
restrictions
imposed
outside
the
facility
which
could
not...
with
respect
to
speech
that
could
not
be
heard
inside.
isn't
that
what
we
did
in
madsen?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
doubt
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
enough
that
the
zone
be
reasonable,
though.
you
use
the
language,
necessitates.
it
isn't
enough
that
it
be
reasonable
to
establish--
justice
antonin
scalia
--such
a
zone.
the
zone
must
be
no
more
than
is
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
under...
why
is
that
a
constructive
blockade?
i...
a
blockade
means
preventing
somebody
from
entering.
were
these
people
preventing
anyone
from
entering?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
just
annoying
the
person--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
why
it
was
a
constructive
blockade.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
it's
not
a
blockade--
justice
antonin
scalia
--constructive
or
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
are
you
going
to
apply
that
to
labor
picketing,
too?
and
claiborne
hardware
case,
where
the
court...
this
court
struck
down
a
speech-restrictive
injunction
because
the
violence
that
accompanied
it
was
episodic
and
isolated.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there...
well,
that's
it,
on
their
way
to
see
the
doctor.
surely
it's
not
the
case
that
every
woman
who's
going
in
there
is
going
in
to
have
an
abortion.
i
assume
they
must
visit
the
clinic
at
least
once
beforehand.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe
once
afterwards.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
probably
less
than
half
of
the
women
who
are
going
in,
just
to
speak
of
the
women
who
are
going
in...
does
this
injunction
apply
only
to
women
going
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
go
in,
so
even
if
you
take
just
the
women,
probably
less
than
half
of
them
are
going
in
to
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
medical
procedure--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
that
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
labor
picketing
in
the
context
of
air
traffic
controllers
would
be
a
different
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
don't
want
to
upset
air
traffic
controllers.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
sticks
and
stones
will
break
my
bones
but
words
can
never
hurt
me.
that's
the
first
amendment.
