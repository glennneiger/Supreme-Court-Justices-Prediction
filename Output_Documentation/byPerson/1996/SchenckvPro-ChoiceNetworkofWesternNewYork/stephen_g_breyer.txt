justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
stop?
i
mean,
we're
15
feet
apart
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
without
this
microphone
i
think
i
can
hear
you
perfectly
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
what
is
the
problem?
i
mean--
[laughter]
--here
we
are,
we're
having
a
conversation,
and
we're
15
feet
apart--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
judge's
decree
allows
everybody
to
go
15
feet
apart,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
still
don't
understand,
what
is
the
word,
or
the
idea,
or
the
expression
that
one
could
make
if
you're
within
a
15-foot
radius
that
you
couldn't
communicate
being
the
distance,
a
little
bit
less
than
the
distance
that
we
are
now.
is
there
some
word,
or
expression,
or
thought,
or
idea,
or
view
that
is
only
communicable
when
i'm
closer
to
you
than
i
am
at
this
moment,
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
they
can
go
up
and
do
that,
can't
they,
unless
the
person
affirmatively
says
that
they
don't
want
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
injunction
let
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
doesn't
the
injunction
allow
someone
to
go
right
up
next
to
the
woman
and
say
here,
i'm
1
foot
away,
would
you
like
to
read
this,
i
want
to
counsel
you,
and
then
the
woman
can
say
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy
and
justice
o'connor,
and
i
wonder,
i'm
just
asking
this,
is
it
relevant
to
consider
this
is
not
labor
picketing
or
civil
rights
picketing
because
the
people
by
and
large
are
pregnant
women
who
are
undergoing
a
serious
medical
procedure.
you
haven't
brought
that
up,
and
i
wonder
the
extent
to
which
that
is
constitutionally
relevant.
i
would
think
it
might
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
in
fact,
coming
right
next
to
a
person,
right
in
their
face,
screaming
at
them
and
so
forth,
does
physically
hurt
them,
then
it's
like
a
stick
or
stone.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
pressing
around
them
and
so
forth
hurts
them
as
they're
going
into
a
medical
procedure,
then
it's
like
a
stick
or
stone.
