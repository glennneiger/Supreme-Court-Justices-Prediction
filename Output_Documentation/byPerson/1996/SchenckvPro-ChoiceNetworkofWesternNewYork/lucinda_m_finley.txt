ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
we
cannot
lose
sight
of
the
record
and
the
evidence
in
this
case.
we
have
here
an
unrelenting
campaign
by
defendants
of
illegal
and
tortious
harassment,
intimidation,
obstruction,
and
trespass
at
health
care
facilities.
we
have
to
keep
that
in
mind
as
well.
the
activity
that
the
district
court
found
occurred
repeatedly
is
antithetical
to
the
need
of
surgical
facilities
and
hospitals
for
quiet
and
calm.
the
idea
of
quiet
zones
and
buffer
zones
around
hospitals
is
a
well
established
traditional
principle
in
law,
and
all
we're
trying
to
do
here
is
make
sure
such
a
zone
pertains
outside
these
surgical
facilities.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
all...
sorry.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
the--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--the
preliminary
injunction
allows
sidewalk
counselors
to
come
right
up
to
people,
which
is
far
more
accommodating
of
defendants'
free
speech
rights
than
the
buffer
zone
affirmed
by
this
court
in
madsen
and
by
the
buffer
zone
around
polling
places
affirmed
by
this
court
in
burson
v.
freeman.
the
injunction
here
gives
far
more
leeway
to
defendants
than
buffer
zones
previously
upheld
by
this
court,
despite
their
record
of
dangerous,
medically
risky,
intimidating
and
harassing
activity.
i
think
we
need
to
focus
on...
yes,
from
15
feet
away
they
can,
in
fact,
communicate.
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
we
are
approximately
15
feet
away
now,
and
he--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--he
refers
to
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
streets.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
most
of
the
time
when
people
are
trying
to
get
in
it's
about
7:00
in
the
morning,
and
there
isn't
much
traffic
on
the
streets
at
7:00
in
the
morning.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
greatest
amount
of
noise
being
created
is
by
the
defendants
themselves.
if
occasionally
other
people
lose
their
cool
and
shout
back,
that's
to
be
expected
and
understood
in
this
kind
of
volatile
situation.
the
district
court
found
that
it's
the
persistent
face-to-face
harangue
by
the
defendants
that
often
triggers
other
people
into
starting
to
yell
back.
it's
the
defendants'
conduct
who
initiates
all
of
this
noise
and
cacophony
outside
of
surgical
facilities,
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
found.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
no,
not
at
all,
of
course--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--no,
it
does
not.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
because
madsen
did
recognize
that
the
governmental
interest
ensuring...
in
ensuring
safe
conditions
for
health
care
is
a
compelling
interest,
and
i
think
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
that
interest
is
very
present
in
this
case.
so
i
think
there
are
a
different
calculus
of
governmental
interests
that
are
involved
when
protest
is
occurring
outside
hospitals
and
surgical
facilities,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
labor
cases,
nlrb
v.
baptist
hospital
and
beth
israel
hospital,
so
sometimes
what
might
be
a
no
more
burdensome
provision
than
necessary
at
a
hospital,
it
may
be
different
from
what
is
no
more
burdensome
than
necessary
at
another
sort
of
facility
that
doesn't
have
the
same
need
for
people
being
able
to
get
in
without
being
in
stressed-out
hysterics.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
well,
of
course,
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction
anyone
has
to
show
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
of
some
valid
cause
of
action.
that's--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--our
causes
of
action...
well,
the
district
court
found
that
in
addition
to
the
federal
civil
rights
claim
that
the--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--dismissed,
and
subsequently
the
complaint
was
amended
and
it
was
reasserted,
but
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
state
law
causes
of
action
for
trespass,
which
under
new
york
law
broadly
protects
people's
use
and
enjoyment
of
their
property
rights,
and
the
causes
of
action
under
new
york
state
law
for
harassing
people
for
exercising
their
right--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--in...
under
new
york
law,
trespass
is
not
simply
the
physical
invasion
of
a
line-demarcated
private
property.
it
also
includes
interference
with
the
fair
and
unfettered
use
and
quiet
enjoyment
of
your
property.
we
also
have
state
law
claims
in
the
case
for
intentional
interference
with
business
relations,
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
our
state
law
causes
of
action
are
virtually
identical
to
the
state
law
causes
of
action
involved
in
madsen.
but
this
issue
of
whether
the
state
law
claims
in
this
case
still
warrant
relief
has
never
been
raised
by
the
petitioners
in
the
lower
court,
which
i
think
is
the
forum
that
should
first
be
given
the
chance
to
look
at
the
remaining
causes
of
action
in
light
of
the
evidence.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
that
is,
i
believe,
an
accurate
quotation
from
madsen,
yes,
justice--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--no.
we
do
not
have
a
no-approach-without-consent
provision
in
this
injunction.
the
cease-and-desist
provision
is
substantially
different.
the
cease-and-desist
provision
specifically
allows
all
uninvited
approaches
without
consent.
it
specifically
allows
the
very
thing
the
madsen
no
approach
zone
did
not
allow.
there's
a
substantial
difference
under
first
amendment
law
between
not
letting
someone
try
to
go
up
to
somebody
versus
saying
you
have
to
respect
that
other
person's
right
to
refuse
you.
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
the
right
to
refuse
a
messenger,
and
the
right
to
make
your
own
choices
about
what
you
do
and
do
not
listen
to--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--nobody
under
this
injunction,
your
honor,
is
protected
from
any
speech
at
all.
they're
just
protected
from
the
forced
physical
proximity
of
an
intimidating
person
with
medical
evidence
that
that
forced
physical
proximity
elevates
health
risks.
everyone
here
is
going
to
have
to
encounter
the
message
whether
they
want
to
or
not.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
yes.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
dr.
hoagland's
testimony,
which
is
extensively
recounted--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--dr.
hoagland
was
certified
as
an
expert
in
both
behavioral
medicine
and
social
impact
theory,
and
social
impact
theory
is,
in
fact,
the
study
of
how
invasions
of
personal
space
create
physical
stress
reactions,
and
the
adverse
effect
of
such
reactions
on
medical
care.
that
was
her
precise
area
of
expertise,
and
she
testified
about
that
at
great
length.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
i...
it
may
be
advisable
for
people
to
put
on
medical
testimony.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
behav...
it's
an
established
area
of
social
science.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
it's
called
social
impact
theory,
a
scholar
named
edward
hall
developed
it
in
the
fifties,
and
there's
been
an
extensive
body
of
research
in
the
fields
of
psychology,
medicine,
and
anthropology
that
have
further
studied
it.
it's
the
idea,
the
basic
idea
that
there
is
a
zone
of
personal
space,
and
it
varies
according
to
the
nature
of
the
encounter.
for
example,
the
appropriate
zone
of
personal
space
here
for
this
sort
of
encounter
is
about
15
feet.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
and
it
did.
it
found
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
no.
i
think
the
relevance
as
i
was
responding
to
justice
scalia's
question,
which
i
understood
to
be
is
there...
what
is
the
problem
with
having
somebody
force
their
physical
proximity
on
you,
so
i
was
highlighting
that
particularly
when
people
are
going
in
for
medical
care,
that
is
a...
it
escalates
the
health
risks,
which
is
a
factor,
of
course,
for
injunctive
relief.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
oh...
oh,
no...
oh,
i--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
if
you
understood
me
to
say
that.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
certainly
i
misspoke
if
i
did.
no,
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction
you
have
to
show
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
of
a
valid
cause
of
action,
irreparable
injury,
no
adequate
remedy
at
law,
which
the
district
court
found
that
we
in
fact
did,
amply.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
absolutely
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
very
much
open
to
the
district
court.
this
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
everything
is
open
to
the
district
court.
the
second
circuit
instructed
petitioners
and
the
panel
2
years
ago
that
they
should
take
these
arguments
to
the
district
court
where
they
belong,
and
they
never
have.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
yes,
of
course.
the
expert
testimony
documented
elevated
physical
medical
risk,
which
is
substantially
greater
than
mere
emotional
upset.
i
want
to
move
a
moment--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--no.
your
honor.
no.
well,
it
may.
we've
never
yet
tested
in
the
district
court
the
state
law
claims
for
tortious
harassment,
for
example,
and
whether
someone
is
being
put
under
medically
dangerous
physical
stress
may
be
highly
relevant
to
whether
you've
made
out
a
claim
for
harassment.
that
issue
has
never
yet
been
tested
in
the
district
court.
also,
the
amount
of
stress
caused,
and
distress,
may
be
highly
relevant
to
whether
we've
made
out
a
claim
under
our
state
law
cause
of
action
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
in
this
context
of
antiabortion
protest,
there
are
state
law-based
decisions
finding
that
conduct
very
similar
to
what
defendants
here
do
constitutes
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
in
the
labor
context,
many
courts
have
established
buffer
zones
to
keep
the
picketers
out
of
the
face
of
people,
particularly
when
they're
picketing
at
hospitals.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
violence
and
intimidation.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
well,
i
think
that
when
people
are
going
in
for
surgery,
and
there's
medical
evidence
that
to
safely
perform
the
surgery
the
stress
needs
to
be
reduced,
not
elevated,
that
is
a
governmental
interest
that
is
present
in
this
context
that
is
only
present
in
labor
contexts
when
people
are
picketing
at
hospitals
or
nursing
homes,
and--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--well,
madsen
recognized
that
the
elevated
medical
risks
are
a
governmental
interest
that
needs
to
be
weighed
in
assessing
whether
the
restrictions
on
speech
are
no
more
burdensome
than
necessary
to
protect
that
governmental
interest
in
ensuring
safe
conditions
for
health
care.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
well,
i'm
sure
your
honors
know
better
what
you
did
in
madsen
than
i
do.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
that
discussion
was...
yes,
your
honor,
that
discussion
was
linked
to
the
noise
provision,
but
the
same
interest
pertains
when
people
are
having
others
screaming
in
their
face.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
whether
the
protest
conduct
disrupts
the
safe
and
normal
functioning
of
the
place
is
a
basic
governmental
interest
that
this
court
has
recognized
many
times
in
grayned
v.
rockford
on,
so
i
think
yes,
whether--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--no,
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
with
your
point
that
the
defendant's
persistent,
proven
conduct
of
crowding,
grabbing,
punching,
sometimes
knocking
people
down
is
what
necessitates
some
kind
of
a
clear
zone
in
this
case.
i
also
want
to
emphasize
this
idea
of
floating--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--no.
in
madsen--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--that's
right,
and
here
the
15-feet,
the
length
of
a
car,
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
a
car
can
safely
drive
down
the
road.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
all
sides
of--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--yes.
it
would
be
like
a
circle
around,
yes.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
no.
two
people
are
walking
side
by
side--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--but
at
all
points
sidewalk
counselors
can
always
come
right
up.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
i
think
i
would
say
it
could
be
30
feet
but
not
60,
15
in
this
direction
and
15...
that's
30.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
it
could
possibly
be,
although--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--the
reason
i
said
possibly
is
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
that
problem
ever
happening.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
need
a
mathematical
expert.
but
this...
the
point
you're
raising--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--i
think
you're
alluding
to
the
notion
of
the
floating
bubble,
and
i
want
to
remind
this
court
that
judges
under
a
federal
statute,
18
u.s.c.
1507,
have
what
amounts
to
a
floating
bubble
around
any
building
or
residence
you
use
or
occupy.
people
can't
go
near--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--but
judges
move
from
building
to
building,
and
it
says
building
or
residence
used
or
occupied
by
judges,
so
you
are
protected
from
people
demonstrating
near
your
courthouse,
your
home,
an
office
you
may
use
off-premises--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--yes,
and
it--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--no,
and
if
there
were
a
record
that
protestors
started
impeding
your
paths
as
you
tried
to
go
to
work
or
to
home,
i
submit
someone
could
easily
get
an
injunction
to
keep
a
clear
zone--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--around
you
so
you
could
get
to
work.
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
and
just
if
i
may
conclude
the
point...
i
see
the
red
light
is
on...
that
a
lot
of
the
problems
you're
alluding
to
are
precisely
because
the
district
judge
here
gave
the
defendants
more
leeway
than
the
fixed
zone
in
madsen.
he
allowed
them
on
the
same
side
of
the
sidewalk,
which
creates
the
need
to
have
a
clear
zone
around
people.
if
you
push
them
across
the
street,
as
you
affirmed
in
madsen,
a
lot
of
these
problems
would
not
arise,
and
this--
ms.
lucinda
m.
finley
--thank
you.
