chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
95-1065,
paul
schenck
and
dwight
saunders
v.
pro-choice
network
of
western
new
york.
mr.
sekulow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sekulow--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
we
can
hear
you
quite
well
if
you
were
to
lower
your
voice
a
little.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
also
said
in
madsen,
mr.
sekulow,
that
some
deference
was
due
to
the
trial
court's
formulation
of
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sekulow.
ms.
finley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
finley,
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
some
special
rule
for
abortion
clinics
that
wouldn't
apply
in
other
cases
where
people
are
being
perhaps
harassed
or
counseled
or
argued
with?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
madsen
doesn't
say
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
keep
stressing
the
quiet
zone
outside
the
abortion--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
we
have
experts
like
that
now
in
any
case
where
we're
talking
about
this
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
she
a
specialist
in,
social
impact
theory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
name
it
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
a
situation
such
as
justice
kennedy
posits,
where
you
walk
through
a
picket
line
to
go
to
work,
and
you've
got
a
very
important
assignment
that
day,
and
you
feel
you're
subjected
to
a
great
deal
of
stress,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
work.
now,
is
that
kind
of
a
separate
governmental
interest
that
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
finley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
dellinger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
would
the
same
reasoning
apply
simply
to
a
group
of,
a
building
where
doctors
had
offices
but
no
surgical
procedures
were
performed?
would
the
same
stress
analysis
apply?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
dellinger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sekulow,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
the
case
is
submitted.
