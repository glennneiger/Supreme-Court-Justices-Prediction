justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
recall,
judge
meskill
in
the
panel
ruling
did
find
that
there
had
been
violations
after
the
issuance
of
the
tro,
and
if
you
would
look
at
a-57
he
refers
to
an
incident
on
march
26,
1991,
in
which
two
men
blocked
the
doorway
to
the
clinic,
and
then
another
one
on
january
1,
so
judge
meskill,
whose
position
i
think
you
are
not
challenging--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
find
post-tro
conduct
that
violated
the
court's
order.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
say
in
your
reply
brief
that
the
district
judge
found
no
defendants
physically
blocked
access
after
the
issuance
of
the
tro,
and
as
i
read
judge
meskill's
opinion
that's
not
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
sekulow,
i
think
you
will
agree
that
it
is
a
standard
in
law
regarding
injunctions
that
if
there
is
no
incident
following
the
tro...
the
tro
is
a
very
temporary
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
there
is
no
violation
of
it,
that
shows
the
injunction
is
working,
not
that
it
should
be
stopped.
i
think
your
proposition
is
extraordinary,
that
if
the
very
brief
tro
is
working,
then
the
injunction
must
be
stopped,
rather
than
maintained.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then...
then
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
tro.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
notion
that
i
thought
you
were
putting
forward
to
us
was
that
because
there
was
compliance
with
the
tro
there
was
no
longer
need
for
that
restraint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow,
you
had--
--but
would
that
solve
the
problem
if
the
injunction
only
applied
to
unescorted
persons?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--unlike
a
statute
that's
just
regulating
everybody,
we
do
have
an
injunction
that's
supposed
to
be
tailored
to
these
circumstances,
and
you
had
no
objection,
i
take
it,
to
injunction
against
grabbing,
pushing,
shoving.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
court
did
make
a
finding
that
the
sidewalk
counselors
often
crowded
around
the
patients,
and
mustn't
there
be
some
kind
of
keep-your-distance
rule
to
prevent
the
pushing,
shoving,
grabbing
that
had
gone
on
before?
there
is
a
past
history
here
that
the
judge
was
taking
into
account.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow,
what
was...
what
is
the
meaning
of
something
that
the
government
emphasizes
in
its
brief,
the
provision
that
if
the
court
concludes
that
some
of
the
relief
requested
by
the
plaintiff
should
be
granted,
that
the
defendants
will
consent
to
the
entry
of
an
injunction
against
each
and
every
one
of
them,
and
the
government
tells
us
that
the
defendants
thus
stipulated
below
that
any
unlawful
conduct
found
to
have
been
performed
by
any
of
them
could
be
attributed
to
all
of
them
for
purposes
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
so
that
sounds
like
if
you
did
have
some
people
crowding,
pushing,
needing
this
kind
of
keep-your-distance
rule,
that
that
same
rule
could
apply
to
all
of
the
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
ask
to
have
that
clarified,
because
wasn't
there
a
point
where
the
district
judge
said,
gee,
that's
not
what
i
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand,
ms.
finley,
that
that
is
still
something
that's
open
to
inspection
by
the
district
judge?
we
did
start
out
with
a
1985(3)
claim
that
the
district
judge
erroneously
thought
was
solid.
then
he
said,
but
there
are
these
state
claims
that
can
be
substituted
for
it,
and
the
second
circuit
refused...
did
not
deal
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
viability
of
this
whole
case
under
state
law
has
yet
to
be
fully
tested
in
the
district
court,
and
it
hasn't
been
touched
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
judge
did
make
a
preliminary
finding
that
you
had
under
new
york
law
a
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
finley,
why
do
you
lay
such
stress
on
this
point,
when
i
thought
the
major
reason
for
the
injunction
and
for
its
provisions
was
that
there
was
a
history
of
grabbing,
pushing,
shoving,
and
the
district
judge
thought
that
it
was
reasonable
to
have
a
keep-your-distance
rule
to
make
sure
that
the
pushing,
grabbing,
and
shoving
didn't
go
on
again?
i
did
not
regard
whatever
you
call
that
expert
as
central
to
your
case,
and
perhaps
you
ought
to
clarify
whether
it
is
an
extra,
or
whether
it's
pivotal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dellinger,
what
is
careful
about
15
feet
of
any
personal
vehicle
seeking
access
to
or
leaving?
one
point
that
was
made
is,
there's
no
definition
of
when
access
begins
or
when
leaving
ends,
so
this
could
go
on
and
on
and
on.
there's
no
stopping
point
and
there's
no
starting
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow,
was
there
any
followup
to
the
colloquy
with
the
district
judge,
who
seemed
to
recognize
that
there
was
some
ambiguity
in
this
15...
what
has
been
referred
to
here
as
the
bubble
zone
within
15
feet
of
persons
or
vehicles
seeking
access
to,
or
leaving
the
facilities...
you've
called
our
attention
to
that
colloquy
where
the
judge
said,
gosh,
i
didn't
mean
that.
