let
me
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
5
feet
be
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
feet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
the
floating
zone--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
your
position
that
a
floating
zone,
no
matter
how
carefully
tailored,
could
never
be
justified
as
a
remedy
for
repetitive
speech?
say
a
person
operated
a
fur
store
and
some
animal
rights
person
wanted...
day
after
day
walked...
followed
the
person
going
to
business,
repeating
the
same
message
over
and
over
and
over
again,
would
the
first
amendment
permit
or
prohibit
some
kind
of
floating
zone
for...
to
protect
that
person
from
just
the
repetition
of
the
same
message
over
and
over
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no...
floating
zone
is
per
se
bad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
just
talking--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
harassing
only
in
the
sense
of
one
must
listen
to
the
same
message
over
and
over
and
over
again,
and
you
say
you
just
have
to...
you
have
to
swallow
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
same
message
over
and
over
and
over--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
then
if
one
could
do
it,
why
is
it
different
if,
instead
of
one
doing
it
20
times,
20
different
people
do
it
in
succession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
think
this
injunction
prohibits
the
speech.
it
just
requires
the
speaker
to
stay
15
feet
away,
which
is
prohibiting
following.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
couldn't
the
counselor
show
the
person
the
bible
within
the
15...
if
the
person
doesn't
object.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
need
more
than
two
people
to
show
the
passage
from
the
bible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
that
because
it's
small
print
you
have
to
be
close
for
the
person
to
be
able
to
read
it.
fifteen
feet,
you
can't
read
the
bible,
obviously.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you're
responding
to
a
question
about
what
can't
you
do
at
15
feet
that
you
could
do
in
less
than
15
feet,
and
it
seems
to
me
your
point
is
you've
got
something
they
couldn't
read.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really
you're
not
resting
on
the
fact
that
they
are
escorts
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
we
don't
have
to
limit
it
to
two.
they
could
have
four
each,
15
feet
apart.
[laughter]
it
would
take
care
of
a
four-lane
highway.
i
don't
know
why
justice
kennedy
limits
it
to
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
point
is
they've
never
used
sticks
or
stones.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
