mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
the
questions
about
the
practicality
of
how
this
injunction
works,
it
might
be
useful
to
look
at
this
case
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
trial
judge
in
february
of
1992.
at
that
point,
he
had
had
several
days
of
hearings
on
the
preliminary
injunction
and
weeks
of
testimony
on
the
contempt
proceedings
against
paul
and
robert
schenck
and
others
who
violated
the
temporary
restraining
order.
one
of
his
findings,
and
they're
set
out
at
pages
79
to
149
of
the
joint
appendix,
one
of
his
findings
was
that
these
named
defendants
had
deliberately
engaged
in
a
technique
of
physically
crowding
in
an
intimidating
and
obstructing
manner.
what's
a
trial
judge
supposed
to
do
in
the
face
of
that
kind
of
finding?
if
he
were
to
issue
an
injunction
precisely
in
those
terms
ordering
the
defendants
to
cease
crowding
in
an
intimidating
and
obstructing
manner,
what
problems
would
that
cause
for
a
police
officer
who
is
at
the
scene,
trying
to
understand
how
to
enforce
that?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i'm--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
kennedy,
i--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
believe
that
it
is
not
difficult
because
the
trial
judge
did
tailor
this
to
burden
no
more
speech
than
necessary
by
making
it
clear
that
this
message,
or
messages
could
continue
to
be
conveyed.
there's
no
speech
that
is
silenced
by
this
injunction.
i
think
the
judge
understood
that
the
message
that
someone
is
about
to
commit
a
deeply
immoral
act
is
disturbing
and
upsetting,
but
that's
the
price
of
the
first
amendment.
one
of
our
citizens
has
a
constitutional
right
to
convey
that
message
to
another,
but
in
this
case
to
avoid
a
different
kind
of
problem,
not
the
message,
but
two
aspects
of
the
crowding
that
are
not
related
to
the
message
are
at
issue
here.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
breyer,
if
you
wish...
well,
in
further
response
to
justice
kennedy,
one
of
those
issues
is
the
sheer
effect
of
the
crowding
itself,
that
is,
the
use
of
what
were
called
constructive
blockades
by
having
4,
6,
10
people
literally
crowd
around
a
patient
as
she
attempted
to
approach
the
clinic,
and
to
use
that
in
an
intimidating
way.
the
second--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
was
a
construct--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
they
were
not
physically
barring
the
people
from
entering,
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--then
it's
not
a
blockade.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
term,
constructive
blockade
i
think
came
from
those
who
were
engaged
in
them,
justice
scalia,
because
the
use
of
4,
6,
or
10
people
to
crowd
around
an
individual
and
to
use
that
effect...
we
had
testimony,
or
the
plaintiffs
had
testimony
in
this
case
of
one
of
the
women
who
said
she
felt
like
she
was
in
the
middle
of
a
lynch
mob.
that
is
intended
to
dissuade
people
from
continuing
to
go,
not
by
appealing
to
her
conscience
or
her
shame
or
her
medical
self-interest,
but
to
dissuade
her
because
of
running
this
gauntlet,
and
if
that
prevents
people--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--here,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--here
i
think
it
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
the
difference
is
that
in
this
case
the...
first
of
all,
there
was
a
record...
the
contempt
proceedings
are
probably
the
most
accessible
place...
that
this
was
constant
and
ongoing,
and
this
was
an
attempt
that
this
was
a
medical
facility,
its--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--those
were
the
ones,
i
think,
that
were
raised
in
the
contempt
proceedings.
the
actual
controversy
itself,
the
actual
proceedings
were
continuous
and,
of
course,
they
were
under,
as
several
justices
noted,
under
a
tro,
so
that,
you
know,
ideally
they're...
they...
there
shouldn't
have
been
any.
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case,
faced
with
this
situation
and
trying
to
give
some
kind
of
guidance
that
would
be
useful
to
the
parties,
to
the
police,
is
to
set
what
justice
ginsburg
called
a
keep-your-distance
rule.
basically--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
do
think
it
is
relevant
in
precisely
this
way.
the
court's
decisions,
like
grayned
v.
city
of
rockford,
about
a
public
school,
nlrb
v.
baptist
hospital,
cases
like
that,
note
that
the
government
interest
is
sometimes
dependent
upon
the
nature
of
the
activities
that
are
to
occur.
you
don't
need
social
science...
you
don't
need
social
science
evidence
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
having
to
go
through
this
kind
of
obstructive
and
intimidating
crowding
is
not
good
for
people
who
are
on
their
way
to
see
the
doctor.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there
are
different--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
it
applies
to
all
of
those,
including
staff
members,
who--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
at
least
there
are
probably
less
than
half
of
them
are
going
in.
some
may
be
being
treated
for
cervical
cancer,
or
for
a
number
of--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
would
apply,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
with,
i
think,
significantly
less
force
than
it
does
in
those
facilities
where
stress
applies.
basically
these...
what
the
judge
came
up
with,
here,
while
protecting
the
ability
to
convey
this
message,
was
a
simple
set
of
rules.
if
you
read...
if
you
read
the
preliminary
injunction
at
pages
183
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
that
is
certainly
part
of
a
calculation
here.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
is...
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
there
would
be
any
prohibition
in
the
first
amendment
or
elsewhere
on
the
use
of
close
physical
proximity
and
an
intimidating
and
obstructing
manner
whether
you're
dealing
with
judges
coming
to
work
or
air
traffic
controllers.
i
mean,
i
think
what
you
want
to
look
at
the
cases
and
be
careful
about,
as
this
judge
was,
is
that
you
do
not
want
to
predicate
an
injunction
on
the
fact
that
the
message
would
be
upsetting
to
the
air
traffic
controllers
or
the
judge.
the
message
is
something
we
have
to
tolerate.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
o'connor,
at
page
29
of
the
joint
appendix
the
judge...
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg...
at
page
8...
29
of
the
joint
appendix
the
judge
notes
precisely
that
this
is
limited
to
activities
that
are
at
the
sites,
not
anywhere
you
may
go
in
doing
it,
and
it
is
limited
as
well
by
the
fact
that
it
simply
says,
stop
crowding
these
patients
and
let
them
walk
away.
it
doesn't--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--thank
you.
