justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
there
was
no
post-tro
conduct
that
justified
the
15-foot
limit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
wanted
to
inquire,
what
is
the
principle
that
limits
the
court
to
the
conduct
post-tro
and
pre-preliminary
injunction,
given
the
long
history
of
discord,
to
use
the
mildest
term,
what
is
it
that
confines
the
district
judge
in
thoughtfully
drawing
a
preliminary
injunction
after
trying
to
preserve
the
peace
with
a
tro,
from
crafting
it
in
a
sensible
way
in
light
of
all
of
the
past
history?
why
is
he
confined
just
to
this
post-tro
conduct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
sekulow,
was
it
suggested
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
that
it
was
inappropriate
or
inadvisable
for
the
district
court
to
maintain
pendant
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
raise
that
point
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
say
that
persons
who
walk
through
a
picket
line
in
order
to
work
despite
a
strike
face
extreme
stress.
have
we
ever
in
the
labor
area
recognized
that
stressed
individuals
is
ground
for
enjoining
picketing
and
labor
protest
activities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
is
an
order
to
prevent
violence,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
cases
do
not
talk
about
stress
to
the
individual.
that's
somewhat
antithetical
to
very,
very
essential
first
amendment
values.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
submit
to
you
that
anybody
who
walks
through
a
picket
line
at
any
facility
in
order
to
take
a
job
during
the
pendency
of
a
strike
is
subjected
to
great
emotional
stress,
and
our
cases
have
never
recognized
that
as
a
ground
for
injunction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
15
feet
on
all
sides.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
the
person,
i
take
it,
or
the
vehicle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
and
so
if
you
have
two
people,
that
amounts
to
a
60-foot
exclusion
zone,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i
have
two
people
walking
15
feet
away
from
each
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
extent
of
the
zone.
it
can
be
60
feet
if
two
people
are
walking
15
feet
away
from
each
other,
each
being
protected
by
the
bubble.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
the
outer
extremities
it
would
be
60.
there's
a
60-foot
slot.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
fifteen...
well,
it's
not...
it's
mathematical.
it's
15
feet
to
the
left,
15
feet
to
the
right,
15
feet
each
between,
that's
60,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
need
evidence
to
add
15
x
4?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
one
of
the
things
he's
supposed
to
do
is
read
the
first
amendment,
i
take
it,
and
what
he's
doing
here
is,
he's
prohibiting
certain
conduct
based
on
speech,
and
that
means
that
the
injunction
must
be
precisely
tailored.
it's
not
just
to
eliminate
harassment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
injunction
goes
much
further
than
that,
and
if
you
want
to
defend
it
as
saying
that
everything
here
is
necessary
to
avoid
the
touching,
grabbing
aspect,
that's
one
thing,
but
the
harassment
rationale
as
i
see
it
goes
much
further.
it
protects
people
against
repeated,
very
annoying,
very
stressful
expression
of
views
by
those
who
differ
with
them--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that's
a
very
difficult
first
amendment
case.
