justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
way
you
would
distinguish,
if
you
would
distinguish
this
situation
from
the
application
of
some
of
the
new
stalker
laws?
justice
david
h.
souter
because?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
the
stalker
does
have
a
message,
and
my
guess
is
a
lot
of
them
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
sekulow,
that
the
closer
they
are,
given
the
history,
the
more
likely
there
are
going
to
be
incidents
of
pushing
and
shoving,
and
you
can't
as
a
practical
matter,
simply
as
a
court,
prosecute
100
contempts
a
day
under
these
orders,
so
the
idea,
to
have
something...
you're
making
a
practicality
argument.
i
think
the
court
is
making
a
practicality
argument.
the
court
is
saying,
let's
have
some
kind
of
a
zone
which
isn't
going
to
cut
off
speech
entirely,
but
which
is
going
to
reduce
the
probability
that
we
are
going
to
have
a
multiplicity
of
contempt
actions
every
time
somebody
walks
into
an
abortion
clinic.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
don't
you
agree
that
the
probability
of
grabbing
is
going
to
be
greater
the
closer
people
are
in
these
situations?
isn't
that
the
point
upon
which
the
court's
order
rests,
and
isn't
that
point
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
point
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's...
i
mean,
the
point
is
correct.
well,
do
you
think
that
the
requirement
of
very
precise
tailoring
is
consistent
with
sort
of
a
prophylactic
provision
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
people
who
were
grabbing
and
shoving
before
were
tightlipped?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
two
go
together,
don't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
building
doesn't
float.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
have
to
get...
on
the
hypothesis
you're
raising,
i
have
to
get
to
the
courthouse
or
to
the
house,
or
whatnot,
before
the
zone
appears.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
come
out
to
meet
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wouldn't
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
wouldn't
there
be
a
difference,
and
isn't
this
the
difficulty
in
this
case,
that
if
there
were
simply
a
15-foot
zone
around
one
person,
that's
fairly
easy
to
administer
and
to
police,
but
when
you've
got
multiple,
intersecting
15-foot
zones
around
a
lot
of
people
who
may
even
be
subject
to
argument
as
even
covered
by
the
zone,
you've
got
something
which
is
far
more
difficult
to
administer.
and
i
was
suggesting
a
moment
ago
that...
when
mr.
sekulow
was
arguing
that
there
was
a
kind
of
a
practicality
consideration
in
having
a
zone
at
all,
but
there's
another
practicality
argument,
and
that
is
when
the
zones
are
moving
and
intersecting
like
this,
it
may
be
difficult
to
enforce
with
reliable
evidence,
with
reliable
proof.
and
isn't
that
a
good
argument
for
saying,
don't
have
floating
zones,
have
fixed
zones.
realize
that
things
are
going
to
be
unpleasant
outside
the
fixed
zones,
they're
going
to
be
less
unpleasant
inside,
but
everybody
will
know
where
the
line
is,
and
the
first
amendment
isn't
going
to
suffer
from
the
uncertainty.
isn't
that
a
fair
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dellinger,
may
i
interrupt
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
i
think
you're
going
on
to
another
point,
and
i
just
want
to
raise
another
point
along
justice
breyer's
lines.
is
your
argument
that
when
the
state
is...
or
when
the
court
is
enforcing,
let's
say,
a
trespassing
law,
in
determining
what
would
be
an
appropriate
injunction
to
enforce
that
star
to
preclude
threatened
violations,
it
may
take
into
consideration
the
activities
of
the
victims,
and
if
the
activity
of
the
victim
may
be
to
obtain
medical
treatment,
then
high
blood
pressure
can
be
taken
into
account.
is
that
basically
your
argument?
