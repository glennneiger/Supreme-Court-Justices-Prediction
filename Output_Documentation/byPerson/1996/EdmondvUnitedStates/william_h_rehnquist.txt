we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-262,
jon
edmond
v.
united
states.
mr.
morrison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
a
judge
advocate
general
for
each
branch,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
article
66
speaks
in
terms
of
assigning,
doesn't
it,
not
appointing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
weren't
any
civilian
judges
in
the
other
branches,
were
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
how
long?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'll
pick
it
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
these
people
you
say
are
principal
officers
are
assigned
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
coast
guard,
who
is
not
a
principal
officer.
isn't
that
a
strange
world?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
would
be
a
fairly
unusual
provision,
though,
for
the
office
to
be
filled
by
presidential
appointment
with
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
for
officials
of...
this
far
down
the
ladder.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
article
66
use
the
word
appointed
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
quite
different
from
appointed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
can
mean...
chosen
can
mean
selecting
from
someone
who
already
holds
the
office.
designated.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
even
further
from
appointed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why?
well,
how
much
implying
are
you
doing
when
the
statute
says
the
secretary
of
transportation
may
appoint
and
fix
the
pay
of
officers
and
employees
of
the
department
of
transportation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
your
authority
for
that,
the...
a
specific
statute
governs--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
preference--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
certainly
there
can
be
situations
in
which
more
than
one
statute
apply,
can't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
no
broader
than
the
authority
of
a
district
court
to
review
the
findings
of
a
special
master,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
morrison.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--doesn't
the
statute
pertain
to
commissioning
of
coast
guard
officers
read
the
same
way?
aren't
they
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
the
same
way
other
officers
are?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
morrison,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
morrison.
the
case
is
submitted.
