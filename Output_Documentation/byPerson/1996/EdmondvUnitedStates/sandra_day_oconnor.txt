justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
coast
guard
is
the
only
place
where
civilian
judges
are
now
used--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--at
the
present
time,
and
i
guess...
i
mean,
even
if
866(a)
were
invalid,
you
still...
as
long
as
they
are
inferior
officers
you
could
look
to
49
u.s.
code
323(a),
i
suppose,
for
the
coast
guard,
for
appointment
by
the
secretary
of
transportation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
just
thought
there
was
a
fall-back
statute,
so
until
you
get
to
whether
they're
principal
or
inferior
officers,
i'm
not
sure
you
can
address
your
first
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
which
gets
further
into
this
principal
or
inferior
business.
how
many
military
officers
are
there
at
present,
more
than
250,000
and
some?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
all
of
those
people
principal
officers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
as
far
as
you're--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--concerned,
if
one
of
those
military
officers
is
reassigned
to
a
principal
office,
then
it
would
require
a
new
appointment
and
confirmation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
do...
you
accept
weiss,
in
other
words.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
aren't
suggesting
any
invalidity
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stewart,
you
were
giving
several
reasons
why
you
say
these
officers
are
inferior,
and
yet
in
one
sense
they
do
have
more
power
than
even
a
normal
court
of
appeals
judge
in
the
federal
system
would
have,
insofar
as
they
make
de
novo
fact-finding
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
review
is
had,
is
it
de
novo
review
of
facts--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
that
enter
the
balance
on
whether
we
think
it's
an
inferior
officer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
navy
used
to
also
have
civilian
judges.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
what
statutory
authority
were
they
properly
employed--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
your
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
here
could
designate
his
authority
to
some
lower
officer
or
employee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
cite
united
states
v.
hartwell,
which
might
deal
with
that
very
question.
do
you
rely
on
it
for
that
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
it
a
little
difficult
to
see
how
delegation
could
survive
under
the
appointments
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
are
you
essentially
adopting
the
position
that
justice
souter
did
in
his
separate
concurring
opinion
in
weiss?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
couldn't
you
give
me
an
easier,
shorter
answer?
do
you
agree
with
justice
souter's
concurrence
in
weiss,
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me.
i
thought
justice
souter
took
the
position
they
were
inferior
officers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
agree
with
that?
