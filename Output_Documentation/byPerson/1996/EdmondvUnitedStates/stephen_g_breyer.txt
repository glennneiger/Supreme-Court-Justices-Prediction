justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
they
wanted
the
jag's...
congress
passed
a
statute
and
said,
we
want
the
jag's
to
do
all
the
appointing.
we
want
them
to.
that's
their
job.
and
one
day
somebody
walked
into
congress
and
said,
you
know,
you've
made
a
little
mistake
here,
because
unfortunately
under
the
constitution
the
civilian
person
doesn't
have
a
presidential
appointment,
and
you've
got
to
give
the
power
to
the
secretary
to
appoint
him.
so
congress
says,
ah,
great
idea.
we'll
say
he
can
be
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
that
cures
it,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
they
say,
you
know,
it
could
come
up
again,
so
why
don't
we
pass
our
statute
in
general
form
and
just
say
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
can
appoint
officers,
and
that
would
cure
it,
i
guess.
he's
an
officer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
somebody
says,
you
know,
you
don't
have
to.
you
already
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
the
difficulty
i'm
having,
because
i
don't
see...
the
statute
there
certainly
would
be
okay
as
a
curative
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
certainly
be
okay
as
a
specific
curative
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
put
the
specific
word
in
general
form,
and
if
somebody
points
out
you
already
have
the
statute
you
don't
need
to
pass
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
it
true...
but
i
take
it
that
nobody
ever
thought
about
this
problem
at
all
in
congress,
so
we're
not...
it's
just
totally
imaginary
to
think
what
they
were
thinking.
they
weren't
thinking
anything,
and
the...
on
this
point,
and
so
i
think
the
argument
is
that
just
as
you
responded
to
justice
kennedy
you
said,
well,
look,
the
secretary
under
this
clause
doesn't
appoint
officers
of
the
coast
guard,
does
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
there's
another
provision
for
that.
he
says,
well,
read
this
provision.
what
this
provision
fairly
read
says
is
that
the
jag
was
going
to
do
the
appointing,
and
just
as
the
officer
of
the
coast
guard
provision
is...
everybody
understood
that,
and
they
know
that
this
general
catch-all
doesn't
apply
to
that,
so
everybody
here
understood
that
the
jag
would
do
the
appointing,
and
so
the
catch-all
doesn't
apply
to
that,
either.
why
do
one
and
not
the
other,
and
it
can't
just
be
a
technicality
of
the
definiteness
of
the
language.
he
says,
look
really
to
the
reality
of
how
the
thing
was
working.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
his
point
was
that
you...
how
far
do
you
go
in
stretching
323
in
order
to
rescue
a
scheme
that
would
be
unconstitutional
if
you
didn't
stretch
323?
