justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
you
say
alj's
are
reviewable
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
routinely
and
automatically
reviewed?
i'm
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
hold
that
in
weiss.
we
left
open
the...
as
i
recall,
justice
souter
wrote
that
that
question
was
involved,
but
as
i
recall
the
opinion
for
the
court
never
addressed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
problem
of
having
a
requirement
for
the
appointment
of
superior...
of
principal
officers
which
can
be
evaded
by
simply
having
an
inferior
officer
reassigned
to
a
task
that
is
the
task
of
a
principal
officer,
never
appointing
that
inferior
officer
by
the
method
set
forth
in
the
constitution.
that's
a
real
problem,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
i
think
it's
a
real
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course--
--but--
--it
goes
to
the
heart
of
your
whole
contention,
because
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
interpret
66
as
you
ask
us
to
interpret
it,
as
being
an
authorization
to
appoint
these
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
president's
resid...
you
make
it
sound
as
though
this
was
totally
within
the
control
of
the
executive,
but
it
wasn't,
because
the
president's
power
is
the
power
to
appoint
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate,
not
alone.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
a
little
harder
than
you
make
it.
it
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
insuperable
at
all,
given
that
the
jag
has
to
do
what
the
secretary
tells
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
power
given
to
the
jag,
unless
it's
expressly
or
implicitly
limited
to
him
alone,
is
certainly
exercisable
by
the
secretary,
is
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
question
of
removing
him.
it's
a
question
of
the
secretary
saying,
i
know
that
this
function
is
assigned
to
you,
but
you
are
my
subordinate,
and
i
am
going
to
exercise
this
function
directly
myself.
can't
that
be
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
and
it
intends,
for
example,
in
the
justice
department
for
the
subordinate
heads
of
the
divisions
to
do
what
they
want,
but
doesn't
the
attorney
general
have
the
power
to
direct
them
to
do
it
the
way
he
wants?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
sets
forth
their
duties?
that's
andrew
jackson
and
the
bank
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
makes
the
difference
whether
you're
inferior
or
not,
whether
what
you're
given
control
of
is
insignificant
or
not?
i
find
that...
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
it
has
any
relevance.
i
mean,
if
i'm
made
an
ambassador
to
a
really
tiny,
itsy-bitsy
country,
am
i
not
a
principal
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i'm
appointed
as
an
independent
counsel
for
a
little
tiny
offense,
am
i
not
a
principal
officer,
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
less
concerned
about
what
it
can
do
to
those
below
it
than
i
am
concerned
with
what
those
above
it
can
do
to
it.
what
is
the
finality
of
the
determinations
made
by
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
what
extent
is
it
subject,
in
other
words,
to
control
by
some
superior
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
any
case,
any
case
can
be
mandatorily
reviewable
so
long
as
the
jag
wants
it
reviewed,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
don't
agree
with
is
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
allow
the
assignment
of
an
inferior
officer
to
the
position...
to
do
a
function
performed
by
principal
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
who
happened
to
have
been
appointed
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
isn't
it,
beyond
that,
your
position
that
to
read
the
language
here,
which
does
not
say
appoint,
to
mean
appoint
the
civilian
officers...
the
civilian
judges
would
be
unconstitutional?
is
that
not...
unless
you
think
the
jag
is
the
head
of
a
department.
you
don't
think
he's
the
head
of
a
department,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
essentially
petitioner
is
asking
that
66(a)
be
interpreted,
although
it
doesn't
say
it
explicitly,
in
a
fashion
that
is
unconstitutional.
