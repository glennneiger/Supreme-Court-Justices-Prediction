justice

souter
but
on
your
theory
they
jump
from
being,
some
of
them
at
least,
inferior
officers
to
superior
officers
based
on
the
general
counsel's
appointment,
or
assignment,
rather.
all
of
them
do.
all
of
them
do,
unless--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
i
understand
your
theory,
what
you
do
have
to
say
on
your
theory
is
that
those
who
are
not
at
the
superior
level
by
virtue
of
their
military
appointments
as
such
suddenly
become
superior
officers
by
virtue
of
this
assignment
to
sit
on
a
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
congress
can
do
that
if
you
lose
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
can
say,
gee,
we
passed
a
fall-back
statute
that
covers
this,
and
maybe
we
don't
want
to
cover
it
again,
and
the
advantage
is
that
you
do
not
for
reasons
of
appointment
formality
disrupt
a
great
many
things
that
have
been
done,
so
why
not
let
congress
have
its
crack
at
it
on
a
different
contingency?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
trouble,
mr.
morrison
is,
if
you're
going
to
make
the
accountability
point,
on
your
theory
the
inferior
military
officer
becomes
a
superior
officer
merely
on
the
designation
of
the
judge
advocate
general,
and
there
is
no
accountability
at
all
for
that.
congress
never
gets
a
look
at
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
--one
thing,
in
the
court
in
question
here,
the
coast
guard
court
does
sit
in
review
on
officers
who
were
themselves
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate.
that
seems
to
me
a
very
substantial
function.
this
court
can
review
the
court
martial
of
an
officer,
can
it
not?
