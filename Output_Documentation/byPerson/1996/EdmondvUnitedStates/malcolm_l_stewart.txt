mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
appointment
at
issue
in
this
case
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
and
was
consistent
with
the
pertinent
statutes.
judges
on
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals
are
inferior
officers
whose
appointment
may
properly
be
vested
in
the
head
of
a
department.
the
judges
are
removable
by
an
executive
branch
official
subordinate
to
the
president,
their
decisions
are
subject
to
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
and
their
jurisdiction
is
confined
to
a
narrow
class
of
cases.
second,
the
appointment
was
consistent
with
the
relevant
statutes.
the
department
of
transportation
act,
49
u.s.c.
323
(a),
authorizes
the
secretary
to
appoint
officers
within
the
department.
nothing
in
article
66
of
the
ucmj
divests
the
secretary
of
that
authority
for
the
courts
to
give--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--for
the
courts
to
give
the
judge
advocate
general
exclusive
power
to
select
members
of
the
courts
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
they
are.
they're
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate,
and
as
with
officers
in
the
other
branches
a
separate
appointment
is
required
for
a
promotion
to
a
higher
rank.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
323(a)
does
not
give
the
secretary
of
transportation
authority
to
appoint
commissioned
officers
in
the
coast
guard.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
there's
a
specific
statute
that
not
only
is
addressed
particularly
to
the
office
in
question,
but
that
provides
an
inconsistent
method
of
appointment.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
correct
that
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
review
in
cases
falling
within
their
jurisdiction
a
court
of
criminal
appeals
may
engage
in
de
novo
fact-finding
as
opposed
to
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
that
would
apply
in
the
civilian
courts.
in
other
respects,
however,
the
powers
of
the
courts
of
criminal
appeals
are
more
limited.
first,
and
perhaps
most
obviously,
the
courts
of
criminal
appeals
hear
cases
falling
within
a
narrow
class
of
jurisdiction,
in
contrast
to
article
iii
courts
of
appeals,
who
can
hear
the
full
range
of
civil
and
criminal
cases.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
certainly
don't
claim
that
that's
dispositive,
but
in
morrison--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
with
respect
to
ambassadors,
obviously
the
constitution
specifically
identifies
that
as
an
office
that
must
be
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate,
but
we
take
your
point
that
there
may
be
officers
who
exercise
power
in
a
limited
area.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
the
court
held
in
morrison
that
it's
an
inferior
officer
rather
than
a
principal
officer.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
but
again
in
terms
of
the
limited
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals,
it's
limited
not
simply
in
the
sense
that
it
hears
only
a
small
category
of
cases,
but
in
the
sense
that
the
only
people
potentially
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
are
individuals
who
have
chosen
to
join
a
specialized
society
knowing
that
they
are
to
be
governed
by
different
rules.
we
would
also
say
that
while
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals
may
engage
in
de
novo
fact-finding,
in
other
respects
its
review
of
court
martial
decisions
is
more
limited
than
that
which
would
prevail
in
the
article
iii
system.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
there
are--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
all
of
its
decisions
are
subject
to
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
there
are
two
categories
of
cases
as
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
exercises
mandatory
review.
those
are
cases
in
which
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
affirmed
sentence
of
death,
and
cases
in
which
the
judge
advocate
general
of
the
service
certifies
the
case
for
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
the
government
as
a
practical
matter
may
insist
upon
further
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
with
respect
to
other
cases,
cases
not
involving
a
sentence
of
death
and
cases
in
which
the
jag
does
not
certify,
the
defendant
may
petition
for
review.
it
is
essentially
like
a
cert
process
where
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
is
not
de
novo--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
is
not
de
novo
review
of
facts.
in
that
limited
sense
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
may
issue
a
decision
which
is
not
effectively
subject
to
reversal
by--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
enters
the
balance,
but
i
think
the
more
important
point
is
that
in
ensuring
the
practical
subordinacy
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
within
the
military
justice
system,
the
important
point
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
may
review
all
questions
of
law,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
subordinate
not
simply
in
the
sense
that
it
is
subject
to
reversal
in
an
individual
case,
but
in
the
sense
that
it
is
obligated
to
follow
the
precedents
laid
down
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
in
prior
cases.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
up
to,
i
believe
the
early
seventies.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
under
our
theory
they
were
not
properly
employed,
and
under
our
theory
the
civilian
judges
who
served
on
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals
prior
to
the
secretary's
january
'93
memorandum
were
not
properly
employed.
indeed,
we
conceded
as
much
in
ryder.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
question
of
delegation
of
appointments
clause
authority
is
a
complicated
one.
my
understanding
is
that
that
is
currently
being
considered
by
others
within
the
department
of
justice,
so
i
would
hesitate--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
hartwell
dealt
with
something
different
from
delegation.
that
is,
by
delegation
we
would
envision
a
system
in
which
a
secretary
said
to
a
subordinate
official,
you
may
exercise
my
authority
to
appoint
a
particular
official
without
further
review
from
me.
what
happened
in
hartwell
was
different.
the
individual
officer
appointed
in
hartwell
was
appointed
by
the
assistant
secretary
with
the
express
approval
of
the
secretary,
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
there
would
certainly
be
concerns
about
whether
the
accountability
was
preserved.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
also
true
that
most
powers
that
are
conferred
upon
department
heads
may
be
delegated
to
subordinates.
in
any
event,
the
secretary
has
not
purported
to
delegate
his
323(a)
authority
in
this
case.
instead,
he
issued
a
memorandum
stating
that
he
was
adopting
the
jag's
assignments
as
appointments
of
his
own.
and
to
return
to
the
point
i
was
making
earlier,
in
some
respects
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
review
of
court
martial
decisions
is
more
limited
than
that
which
would
occur
in
an
article
iii
court
in
the
criminal
context.
that
is,
under
the
sentencing
reform
act,
a
court
of
appeals
within
the
federal
system
may
hear
a
government
appeal
from
a
district
court
sentencing
determination
and
may
determine
that
the
sentence
was
not
harsh
enough.
in
the
military
justice
system,
by
contrast,
article
66
makes
it
clear
that
the
review
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
limited
to
the
sentence
as
entered
by
the
court
martial
and
approved
by
the
convening
authority.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
we
conceded
in...
the
government
conceded
in
weiss
at
oral
argument
and
we
would
concede
here
that
if
judges
on
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals
were
principal
officers,
there
would
be
a
substantial
constitutional
question
as
to
the
status
not
only
of
the
civilian
judges
but
as...
but
of
the
military
judges
as
well.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
are
not
prepared
to
concede
that
the
appointment
would
necessarily
be
invalid.
that
is,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
judges
on
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--oh,
yes,
we
definitely
agree
with
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
that's
correct.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statutory
question--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we're
not
prepared
to
concede
at
this
point
that
an
inferior
officer
who
was
appointed
by
the
president
with
senate
confirmation...
we're
not
going
to
concede
as
a
categorical
matter
that
that
person
could
not
be
shifted
to
a
principal
office.
if
we
lose
this
case
on
the
appointments
clause
question
we
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--look
at
the
opinion
and
see
what
it
said.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
with
respect
to
the
statutory
question,
we
want
to
make
clear
the
government
is
not
arguing
that
congress,
in
passing
the
department
of
transportation
act,
specifically
contemplated
that
the
secretary's
authority
would
be
used
with
respect
to
civilian
judges
on
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals.
in
our
view,
that's
simply
not
the
correct
question.
the
question
first
is
whether
section
323(a)
by
its
terms
authorizes
the
secretary
to
act,
and
we
think
it's
clear
that
it
does.
section
323(a)
says
specifically
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
may
appoint
officers
and
employees
within
the
department.
there's
no
question
that
a
judge
on
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
an
officer
within
the
department
of
transportation,
and
so
the
real
question
is,
does
article
66
of
the
ucmj
divest
the
secretary
of
the
authority
that
he
would
otherwise
possess
with
respect
to
these
civilian
judges,
and
we
think
for
two
reasons
that
it
shouldn't
be
read
that
way.
first,
article
66
doesn't
use
the
word
appoint.
it
says
the
judge
advocate
general
can
establish
a
court
of
criminal
appeals,
refers
to
judges
assigned
to
that
court,
but
there's
no
plain
language
that
would
suggest
that
the
judge
advocate
general
makes
appointments
at
all,
let
alone
that
he
is
the
sole
appointing
authority.
with
respect
to
one
point
made
by
the
petitioners,
in
our
view
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
and
this
court's
opinion
in
weiss
makes
clear
that
the
point
of
vesting
this
authority
in
the
judge
advocate
general
was
to
remove
the
matter
from
the
influence
of
the
commanding
officer
who
convened
the
court
martial,
not
to
remove
the
decision
from
the
control
of
the
secretary
of
transportation
and,
indeed,
if
congress'
purpose
were
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
influence
the
assignment
process,
it
would
have
been
bizarre
to
give
assignment
authority
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
that's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
definiteness
of
the
language
is
one
point,
but
i
think
what
we
would
say
is
even
more
important
is
that
the
jag
is
a
subordinate
official
within
the
department
of
transportation
who
is
subject
by
statute
to
the
secretary's
control
and
who
could
be
directed
by
the
secretary
to
assign
a
particular
individual
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
and
therefore
while
it
would...
it
would
obviously
disrupt
the
statutory
scheme
for
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
purport
to
appoint
commissioned
officers
within
the
coast
guard,
because
that
would
subvert
in
a
very
practical
way
the
process
that
congress
had
established
for
making
people
a
part
of
the
coast
guard,
since
the
secretary
could,
in
any
event,
direct
the
jag
to
assign
a
particular
individual
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
there's
no
practical
disruption--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--by
saying
that
the
secretary
can
exercise
that
authority
himself.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
but
the
jag
certainly
could
not
assign
civilian
judges
to
the
court
without
an
appointment
from
someone
else,
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
correct,
in
a
fashion
that's
unconstitutional
and
also
in
a
fashion
that
would
subvert
congress'
intention
that
the
services,
and
particularly
the
coast
guard,
should
be
able
to
use
civilian
judges.
that
is
i
think...
one
important
point
is
that
to
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
with
respect,
we
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
it's
not
a
stretch.
article
323(a)
says
categorically
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
may
appoint
officers
and
employees
within
the
department.
the
only
remotely
difficult
question
is
not
whether
323(a)
applies
by
its
terms,
but
whether
article
66
takes
away
the
authority
that
was
otherwise
conferred,
and
we
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
to
the
extent
that
we
can
hazard
an
educated
guess
as
to
what
congress
anticipated,
neither
side
in
this
case
is
arguing
that
the
system
should
work
in
precisely
the
manner
that
congress
expected.
that
is,
probably
congress
expected
that
the
jag's
would
be
solely
responsible
for
placing
individuals
on
the
courts
of
criminal
appeals,
but
it
surely
expected
that
the
pool
of
potential
judges
would
include
all
civilians
who
were
members
of
the
bar
of
a
federal
court,
or
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
and
we
know
that
it
can't
work
that
way.
we
can't
have
both
sole
authority
in
the
jag
and
that
pool
of
judges,
and
therefore
it
can't
be
a
dispositive
objection
to
our
theory
that
congress
didn't
anticipate
that
it
would
work
that
way.
to
the
extent
that
congress'
expectations
are
relevant
at
all,
the
more
accurate
question
is,
which
approach
preserves
more
of
what
congress
wanted
than
the
other
one,
and
we
think
it
would
clearly
have
been
more
important
to
congress
that
the
potential
pool
of
judges
remain
the
same,
rather
than
that
the
authority
be
lodged
in
the
judge
advocate
general
rather
than
the
secretary,
because
the
secretary
in
any
event
could
direct
the
jag
to
appoint...
to
assign
whatever
individuals
he
wanted.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
