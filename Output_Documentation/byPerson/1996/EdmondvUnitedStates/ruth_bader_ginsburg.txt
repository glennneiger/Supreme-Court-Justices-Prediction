justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
morrison,
isn't
that
a
bit
much,
when
you
think
of
all
of
the
alj's,
all
of
the
people
who
perform
comparable
functions,
the
trial
people
at
the
tax
court,
and
to
take
this
officer,
as
important
as
his
job
is,
and
to
say
that
this
intermediate
appellate
judge
is
a
principal
officer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
morrison,
but
we
do
know
that
congress
wanted
to
have
these
tribunals,
and...
including
civilians.
if
we
take
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
then
we
are
demolishing
what
congress
wanted.
if
we
take
the
government's
view
that
323...
is
that
what
it
is
+/?
can
supplement
66,
then
we
save
what
congress
plainly
wanted
to
do,
so
why
doesn't
the
statutory
argument
turn
against
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
some
differences--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
for
example
there's
a
fixed
tenure
for
tax
court
judges
that
doesn't
exist
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
that
subject,
mr.
morrison,
do
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
prospectively,
if
you're
right...
i
know
that
you
have
a
client
concern...
because
there
is
the
important
liberty
interest
that
you
describe,
all
of
the
judges
of
this
tribunal
would
be
military
and
none
would
be
civilian?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
prevail
then,
of
course,
there's
one
result
for
your
clients,
but
the
result
for
the
system
is
that
unless
and
until
congress
does
something
further,
all
of
the
judges
must
be
military
people.
