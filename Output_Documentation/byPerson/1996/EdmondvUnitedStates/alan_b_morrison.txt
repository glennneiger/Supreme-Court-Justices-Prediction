mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
civilian
judges
of
the
courts
of
criminal
appeal
of
the
coast
guard
were
properly
appointed.
in
actuality,
there
are
two
questions:
1)
did
the
secretary
of
transportation
have
the
statutory
authority
to
make
the
appointment,
and
2)
if
he
did,
is
it
constitutional
for
him
to
have
done
so
because
the
officers
are
principal
offices
rather
than
inferior
officers.
congress
first
provided
for
civilian
appellate
judges
in
the
armed
services
in
1950,
with
the
passage
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
in
particular,
article
66(a).
it
was
available
to
all
of
the
armed
services,
but
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
it
was
intended
principally
for
the
use
of
the
coast
guard.
until
1993,
the
coast
guard
used
civilian
judges
and,
like
all
of
the
other
military
judges
who
were
appointed
to
the
military
appellate
panels,
they
were
appointed,
as
they
were
for
the
other
armed
services,
by
the
person
known
as
the
judge
advocate
general
of
the
armed
services,
which
in
the
case
of
the
coast
guard
is
the
general
counsel
of
the
transportation
department,
and
before
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
treasury
department.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
in
the
transportation
department...
there
is
no
one
in
the
coast
guard.
that
position
by
statute
is
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--general
counsel
of
the
department
of
transportation.
in
1993,
the
court
of
military
review
for
the
coast
guard,
as
it
was
then
known,
recognized
that
there
were
serious
appointments
clause
problems
with
respect
to
the
civilian
members
of
the
coast
guard
court
of
military
review.
the
problem
arose
because
the
judge
advocate
general
is
clearly
not
one
of
those
listed
persons
in
the
appointments
clause
and
therefore
cannot
constitutionally
be
designated
as
an
appointing
officer
even
for
inferior
officers.
as
part
of
its
opinion
in
a
case
called
senior,
the
coast
guard
court
of
military
review
asked
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
"reappoint"
all
of
the
civilian
judges,
and
he
did
that.
in
fact,
he
did
that
for
all
of
the
judges
of
the
coast
guard
court
of
military
review,
and
although
he
did
not
cite
49
u.s.c.
section
323(a),
or,
in
fact,
any
other
provision,
that
is
the
statute
on
which
the
government
relies,
and
the
first
question
presented
is,
is
that
reliance
justified?
the
government
recognizes
that,
despite
the
broad
language
of
section
323(a),
it
cannot
be
used
if
there
is
another
statute
that
provides
for
another
method
of
appointment
for
this
particular
office
or
any
other.
the
question
in
this
case
arises
because
article
66(a)
does
not
use
the
word,
appointment.
it
uses...
it
used
initially
establish,
and
then
constitute,
but
the
history
is
clear
that
from
1950
until
1993,
it
was
the
judge
advocate
general
who
actually
did
the
appointing
for
the
civilians.
the
government
says
because
the
word
appointment
wasn't
used
we
should
not--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
well,
it
first
talks
about
constitute
and
establish,
and
then
it
uses
the
word
assignment.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
government
argues
from
that
that
it
should
not
be
treated
as
an
alternative
method
of
appointment.
the
first
answer
we
have
to
that
is
that
it
has
been
construed
by
the
agencies
all
across
the
military
from
1950
to
1993
as
providing
the
appointment
power.
indeed,
there
is
no
other
provision
of
law
that
would
allow
the
appointment
of
civilian
judges
in
the
coast
guard.
there
certainly
was
nothing
from
1950
to
1968...
'66,
when
the
coast
guard
was
transferred
from
the
treasury
department--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
there
were,
your
honor.
there
were
also
in
the
navy.
the
navy
had
a
number
of
them.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it's
in
note
2
of
my
brief,
your
honor.
i'll--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
and
it's
also
recognized
in
the
weiss
opinion
as
well.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
that
gets
to
our...
that
is
the
question,
your
honor,
whether
you
can,
and
the
coast
guard--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
323(a)
is
a
fall-back
statute
or
not
is
very
much
of
an
open
question,
and
we
first
suggest
that
66(a)
has
been
treated
as
though
it
were
an
appointment
clause
in
all
of
the
armed...
in
all
of
the
armed
service
appointment
statutes,
in
all
of
the
armed
services,
including
the
coast
guard,
and
the
history
is
absolutely
clear
that
it
has
been
construed
that
way,
for
there
is
no
other
source
of
appointment.
but--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i...
that
is
about
correct.
i
don't
know
for
sure,
but
it's
in
that
order
of--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
believe
so.
it's
never--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--been
tested.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
the
appointment
clause
requires
a
method
of
appointment.
in...
under
our
constitutional
scheme,
every
inferior
officer
of
the
united
states
could
be
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
the
congress
is
given
the
option
to
make
a
law
that
provides
for
one
of
three
alternative
methods
of
appointment,
but
the
fact
that
somebody
is
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
does
not
make
them,
by
that
alone,
a
principal
officer,
but--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
have
no
choice,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes...
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
government
seems
to
say
that
under
the
scheme
that
they
have
devised
using
323(a)
to
rescue
them...
and
by
the
way,
justice
o'connor,
there
was
a
very
simple
solution
in
1993
when
this
problem
was
recognized.
all
the
government
had
to
do
at
that
point
was
to
ask
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
appoint
the
civilian
judges
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate,
and
the
problem
would
have
been
cured
prospectively
at
that
point,
so--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i'll
be
glad
to
turn
to
that
question,
your
honor.
first,
let
me...
our
principal
focus
on
the
principal
officer
point
is
twofold.
one
is
that
these
judges
have
very,
very
broad
powers
of
review,
and
second
that
they
have
practical
finality.
that
latter
characteristic
distinguishes
them
from
the
trial
judges
that
your
honor
was
talking
about,
the
alj's,
all
of
whose
decisions
are
reviewable
as
of
right.
judges'
decisions
by
the
coast
guard
court
of
military
review
and
of
the
other
armed
services
are
reviewable
on
a
discretionary
basis
only,
certiorari,
in
essence,
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
and
less
than
4
percent
of
those
cases
get
taken.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
of
right.
the
decisions--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--as
of
right,
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
correct.
certainly
in
all
of
the
examples
that
the
government
cites
on
pages
26
and
27
of
its
brief,
and
obviously
there
may
be
some
alj
some
place
whose
decisions
are
not,
but
my
understanding
of
the
basic
structure
of
the
apa
is
that
every
person
who
is
dissatisfied
with
the
decision
by
the
alj
can
at
least
go
to
an
agency
head
and
in
most
cases
to
a
court
of
law
as
of
right,
in
contradistinction
to
this
case,
in
which
the
reviews
are
entirely
discretionary.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
sorry,
you
mean
the
military
officers,
or
the
civilians,
because--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--as
far
as
the
military
officers
are
concerned,
they
may
be
assigned
by
the
general
counsel,
but
under
weiss,
under
this
court's
decision
in
weiss,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
separate
appointment
required
for
them.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
all
of
the
appellate
judges,
yes.
we're
not
talking
about
trial
judges
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
they
may
well
be...
it
is
entirely
possible
for
various
officers
in
the
military
to
reach
certain
points
in
which
they
may
be
principal
officers.
that
is,
for
instance,
somebody
could
be
a
high-ranking
person
that
could
be
a
principal
officer
in
the
military.
without
knowing
what
the
duties
are,
i
couldn't
tell
for
sure.
i
would
say
the
likelihood
is
not
great,
but
there
are
probably
not
very
many
in
the
coast
guard,
other
than
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is...
but
that
is
constitutionally
acceptable,
as
this
court
held
in
weiss,
because
they
were
appointed
as
principal
officers
along
the
way.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
said
as
i...
we're
talking
about
civilian--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i
think
it
is,
but
my
burden
today
is
a
more
limited
burden,
which
is
for
the
civilians
who
were
never
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
to
positions
in
the
coast
guard,
that
they
cannot
be
reassigned
or
anything
by
the
judge
advocate
general
to
these
positions.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
i...
well,
we
know
for
a
fact
that...
and
i
don't
believe
the
government
disputes
this.
from
1950
until
1993,
article
66
was
the
only
provision
relied
upon
for
the
appointment
of
civilians
to
the
courts
of
military
review
for
the
coast
guard
and
for
the
navy,
which
is
the
only
two
services
that
had
them,
and
so
insofar
as
that
fact
is
concerned,
it's
not
disputed.
i
would
say,
however,
if
the
court
agrees
with
me
on
my
first
issue...
that
is,
on
the
first,
the
statutory
construction
issue,
the
court
need
not
reach
this
constitutional
question.
it
simply
says,
the
secretary
of
transportation,
construing
the
statutes
together,
does
not
have
the
authority
in
part
because
it
produces
a
series
of
results
with
regard
to
the
courts
of
military
review
that
don't
make
any
sense.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
we
have
two
rules
of
construction
in
conflict.
one
is
to
try
to
save
the
statute,
as
your
honor
has
just
suggested.
the
other
is
to
try
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question,
which
i
have
suggested
also
comes
into
effect
here.
but
there
is
another
way,
of
course,
to
have
saved
this
statute,
which
is
to
have
had
the
president
of
the
united
states
make
these
appointments
in
january
1993,
instead
of
going
through
the
short-cut
of
having
the
secretary
of
transportation
do
it,
because
under
the
constitution
the
president
has
the
power
to
appoint
all
officers
of
the
united
states
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
the
only
time
he
does
not
have
that
power
is
when
congress
expressly
by
law
takes
it
away
from
him
and
gives
it
in
a
valid
law
to
somebody
else.
since
the
law
as
applied
to
civilians
in
the
coast
guard...
appointments
by
the
judge
advocate
general...
was
not
a
valid
law,
the
president's
residual
power
would
come
forward.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
not...
i
think
probably
not,
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter.
there
are
two
judges
at
this
point
in
the
coast
guard.
the
president
says,
these
people
have
been
serving.
he
reappoints
them.
there
are
problems
with
appointment,
but
i
don't
think
this
would
come
within--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
i
don't
know
that
that's...
i
view
them
as
comparable
to
people
in
the...
as
tax
court
judges,
your
honor,
and
tax
court
judges
are
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
there
are
various
administrative
boards
whose
members
are
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
there
would,
of
course,
be
one
anomaly,
which
is
that
you
would
have
some
people
who
are
chosen
by
the
president
and
other
people
who
are
chosen
either
by
jag
or
the
secretary
of
transportation.
that's
what
we're
concerned
about
here.
if
the
government's
view
is
upheld,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
some
of
the
members
of
the
coast
guard
court
of
criminal
appeals
will
be
appointed
by
the
president...
by
the
jag,
selected,
assigned,
chosen
by
the
jag,
if
i
may
use
neutral
terms...
others
will
be
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
transportation.
article
66(a)
specifically
says
that
the
chief
judge
of
each
of
these
courts
of
military
appeals
are
to
be
appointed
by
the
jag.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
says
chosen
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
in
this--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--designated.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
except
that
in
this
case
if
you
look
at
the
appointing
memorandum
here
it
appoints
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
designates
chief
judge
baum
as
the...
this
is
in
our
appendix
at
a7...
i'm
sorry,
at
a6.
he
has...
the
secretary
of
transportation
has
designated
chief
judge
baum,
the
only
civilian,
as
the
chief
judge
of
the
court.
that
is
contrary
to
what
the
statute
says.
similarly,
the
statute...
we
have
a
situation,
supposing
a
vacancy
now
occurs
on
the
coast
guard
court.
it's
one
of
the
military
officers
who
are
regularly
and
routinely
reassigned.
the
question
then
becomes,
who
gets
to
fill
this
vacancy?
does
the
jag
get
to
fill
it
by
assignment,
or
does
the
secretary
get
to
fill
it
by
appointment?
the
next
thing
we
would
know,
we
would
have
a
larger
number
of
civilian
judges.
i
say
this
not
because
it's
an
insuperable
problem,
but
it
creates
a
situation
which
seems
to
be
very
different
from
what's
created
by
the
statute
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
entirely
true.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
the
jag
is
independently...
general
counsel
is
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
transportation
department
could
be
removed
by
the
secretary
of
transportation
if
the
president
wanted
to
keep
him.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
think
that's
the
question,
but
it's
by
no
means
clear
that
that's
correct,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
there
are
other
things
about
this
statute
which
suggest
that
although
congress
didn't
use
the
word
exclusively
here,
that
it
did
intend
for
the
jag's
to
be
in
charge
of
the
process.
as
this
court
recognized--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--your
honor--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
yes,
sir.
well,
that's
right,
except
that
as
i
suggested...
he
said
he
would
fire
his
secretary
till
he
finds
one
that
agrees
with
him.
here,
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
general
counsel
cannot
necessarily
be
fired
by
the
secretary
of
transportation
because
the
general
counsel
is
a
presidential
appointee.
but
there's
an
important
set
of
reasons
why
i
would
say
that
the
justice
department
analogy
doesn't
apply,
other
than
the
fact
that
there
are
no
specific
duties
listed
for
most
high-ranking
officials
in
the
justice
department.
it
simply
says
there
shall
be
11
assistant
attorneys
generals
who
shall
carry
out
the
duties.
here,
in
article
66,
i
believe
the
fair
reading
is
that
congress
has
constructed
a
system
in
which
they
are
taking
the
control
over
the
workings
of
the
courts
of
military
review,
or
now
courts
of
criminal
appeal,
out
of
the
line
authority.
that
is,
from
the
secretary
of
defense,
secretary
of
transportation,
and
put
the
control
in
the
lawyers.
that
is
to
prevent
what
this
court
recognized
in
weiss
was
the
possibility
of
improper
command
influence,
and
this
shows
up
in
the
selection
of
the
chief
judge,
in
the
fact
that
the...
by
the
jag,
by
the
fact
that
the
jag
designates
who
shall
sit
on
what
panels,
by
the
fact
that
the
rules
for
the
courts
of
military
review
are
decided
by
the
jag's,
and
that
the
jag's
are
regularly
scheduled
to
meet
on
practices
and
procedures.
this
is
more
than
simply
interstitial
law-making.
this
is,
in
our
view,
a
deliberate
decision
by
the
congress
to
say,
for
whatever
reason...
and
i
suggest
that
there
are
many
good
ones
relating
to
command
influence...
we
want
the
jag's
rather
than
the
departmental
heads
to
be
involved
in
this
process.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
that--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
my
submission
is
that
this
general
statute
should
not
be
applied
here
because
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
it's
not...
in
the
words
that
this
court
used
just
recently
in
the
robinson
v.
shell
oil
case
in
part
2a
of
its
opinion,
even
were
the
plain
language
to
apply,
the
result
must
also
be
consistent
and
coherent
and
workable,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
implying
the
authorization
for
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
make
the
appointment
here
runs
up
against
that
problem,
and
therefore
you
should
construe
this
not
to
do
so.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
let
me
suggest
this.
i
said
at
the
beginning,
and
the
government
doesn't
dispute
it,
that
if
there
is
another
specific
statutory
scheme
for
appointment
of
other
officers,
as
there
is...
for
instance,
there's
a
general
counsel
in
the
department
of
transportation...
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
could
not
use
this
residual
power
of
appointment
whether
the
person
is
an
inferior
officer
or
not,
and
i--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
and
the
question
is,
did
congress
intend
to
allow
this
to
apply,
given
the
lengths
to
which
they
went
in
article
66(a)?
now,
there
are
two
advantages
in
accepting
this
approach.
number
1
is,
it
sends
the
matter
back
to
congress
so
that
congress
can
look
at
this
and
say,
now,
which
makes
sense?
which
system
do
we
want
to
have?
because
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
congress
has
never
focused
on
the
appointments
clause--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
gets
me
to
my
second
submission,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
it
avoids
the
constitutional
question,
to
which
i'd
now
like
to
return.
as
i
said
before,
my
two
principal
arguments
on
the
constitutional
issue
are
that
the
broad
range
of
review
that
the
judges
of
the
courts
of
criminal
appeal
have,
they
have
an
enormous
power.
they
review
every
single
conviction
of
every...
any
significance
in
the
military.
every
bad
conduct
discharge,
every
confinement
for
a
year
or
more
appeal
as
of
right
to
these
courts.
as
the
court
of
military
appeals
said
in
1990
in
the
cole
case,
this
is
an
awesome
plenary
power
of
de
novo
review
of
facts
and
law.
there
is
an
unusually
broad
power
of
review
of
facts.
as
article
66,
quoted
on
page
3
of
our
brief,
says,
judges
may
weigh
evidence,
judge
the
credibility
of
witnesses,
and
determine
controverted
issues,
questions
of
fact,
recognizing
the
trial
court
had
the
opportunity
to
see
and
hear
the
witnesses.
that's
an
extraordinary
power
of
review,
far
broader
than
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
have
in
our
federal
criminal
system.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
say
that
that
is
correct.
district
judges,
of
course,
i
believe
are
principal
officers,
your
honor.
the
government
has
never
suggested
otherwise.
but
the
second...
and
the
second
reason
is
the
question
of
finality,
and
that
gets
me
to
my
freytag
point,
which
is
that
in
freytag
this
court
ruled
that
the
chief
judge
of
the
tax
court
had
the
authority
to
appoint
inferior
officers,
and
in
my
view,
implicit
in
that
decision
was
a
recognition
that
the
judges
of
the
tax
court
had
to
be
principal
officers,
for
otherwise
you
would
have
a
system
in
which
inferior
officers
were
appointing
other
inferior
officers,
precisely
the
diffusion
of
power
and
accountability
the
appointment
clause--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
makes
a
point
of
that.
my
view
on
that
is
that
the
tenure
question
is
most
important
with
respect
to
the
office
rather
than
the
office-holder.
surely,
for
example,
if
the
secretary
of
transportation
for
the
last
40
years
had
had
terms...
the
secretary
of
transportation
serves
at
the
will
of
the
president.
if
we
could
show
that
he
was
only
there
for
a
year
or
two
each
time
before
there
was
a
turnover,
nobody
would
say
they
aren't
principal
officers.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
lost
that
issue
in
weiss,
and
i'm
not
here
to
reargue
it
again
today.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
i
may.
if
you
ask
a
question,
your
honor,
i'll
be--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i'd
just
like
to
add
to
mr.
stewart's
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
de
novo
review.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
cannot
review
sentences
in
the
same
way
that
the
courts
of
criminal
appeals
can
do,
and
so
that's
an
additional
power
that
extends
beyond
it.
for
better
or
for
worse,
the
constitution
creates
only
two
categories
of
officers
of
the
united
states.
they
must
either
be
principal
officers
or
inferior
officers
and,
thus,
if
the
court
reads
323(a)
the
way
that
mr.
stewart
suggests,
the
court
must
then
face
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
on
balance
these
officers
are
more
like
principal
officers
or
more
like
inferior
officers.
we
believe
that
the
comparisons
with
the
courts
are
the
most
relevant
comparisons,
and
that
compared
with
the
judges
of
the
tax
court
and
other
similar
judges,
these
judges,
who
deal
not
simply
with
money
but
with
liberty
and
life
in
some
cases,
are
sufficiently
important...
they're
sufficient--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i...
if
i
understand
your...
until
congress
could
correct
it,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
would
have
to
be
civilian.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
unless
the
president...
as
i
said
before,
the
president--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct.
as
i
said
before,
the
president
could
step
in
tomorrow
and
send
these
nominations
to
the
senate,
and
as
soon
as
they
were
confirmed,
that
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient,
because
under
the
appointments
clause
the
president
has
the
ultimate
fall-back
authority
to
make
these
appointments
and
to
cure
the
constitutional
defect.
so
the
question
then
is,
under
this
choice
that
the
court
must
make
if
it
agrees
with
the
government's
submission
on
323(a),
are
they
more
like
principal
officers
or
are
they
more
like
inferior
officers
and
we
believe
that,
given
their
wide-ranging
powers
and
the
practical
finality
of
their
decisions,
the
balance
favors
principal
rather
than
inferior
officers.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
