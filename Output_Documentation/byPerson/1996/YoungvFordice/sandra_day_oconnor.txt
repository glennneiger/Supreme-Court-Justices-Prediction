justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
here
about
that?
suppose
from
the
outset
mississippi
had
said
we're
not
going
to
change
our
state
and
local
registration
system
from
what
it's
been.
we're
going
to
keep
it,
but
here
are
the
changes
we're
offering
to
implement
for
federal
election
purposes
the
nvra.
could
the
department
of
justice
refuse
to
preclear
such
a
scheme
if
mississippi
kept
in
place
its
state
local
registration
scheme
and
had
a
proposal
that
met
the
statutory
requirements
for
the
nvra?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
nvra
requirements
expressly
state
that
they
govern
only
federal
elections?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
seems
to
be
some
indication
in
the
statute
itself
that
it
never...
congress
never
purported
to
require
a
change
in
requirements
for
state
and
local
elections.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
that
the
attorney
general
can
make
that
a
condition
of
any
approval?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
any
section
5
state
you
think
the
attorney
general
can
insist
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
can
understand
that,
but
to
ask
the
further
question
whether
the
attorney
general,
assuming
the
forms
make
it
clear
that
it's
only
for
registration
for
federal
elections
as
the
law
indeed
says
is
necessary,
whether
it
can
go
beyond
that
and
say,
moreover,
state,
you
have
to
make
this
a
unitary
system
now
and
follow
the
federal
plan
for
all,
even
state
and
local.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
reinstated,
kept,
unchanged
from
the
past,
but
following
the
new
law
for
federal
elections.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seems
so
counterintuitive
in
the
face
of
language
in
the
statute
whereby
congress
expresses
the
intent
not
to
require
a
change
for
state
and
local
registration
purposes.
that's
the
troublesome
part
of
this
case
for
me,
anyway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
might
be
important
to
other
members
of
this
court
to
know
just
how
far
the
attorney
general's
position
goes.
it
certainly
is
important
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
if
we
agree
that
the
state's
proposals
to
administratively
and
by
state
law
implement
the
requirements
of
the
new
federal
act
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
for
preclearance,
do
you
also
take
the
position
espoused
by
ms.
wright
that
the
attorney
general
may
require
the
state
to
go
to
a...
the
same
system
for
its
state
and
local
voter
requirements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
procedures
it
did
submit
to
the
attorney
general
contained
within
them
a
proposal
for
changing
state
law
to
go
to
a
system
that
would
be
the
same
for
federal
as
well
as
state,
but
i
thought
the
attorney
general's
own
requirements
and
that
of
federal
law
in
this
area
did
not
permit
the
attorney
general
to
act
on
something
on
the
basis
of
laws
that
had
not
been
passed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
attorney
general,
instead
of
acting
on
this,
should
have
just
said
we
can't
act
on
it
at
this
stage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
shouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
the
federal
law
requires.
they
don't
have
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
what
it
purported
to
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
was
surprised
it
dealt
with
it
at
all.
i
would
think
that
the
normal
thing
would
be
to
send
it
back
to
the
state
and
say,
this
law
hasn't
passed.
we're
not
in
a
position
to
act
on
it
until
it
does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
isn't
clear
from
the
language
of
the
act
that
congress
passed,
which
seemed
to
leave
in
place,
if
states
chose,
their
existing
system
for
state
and
local
elections.
i
thought
that
was
pretty
clear
from
the
face
of
the
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that
was
what
ms.
wright
argued,
and
i
thought
you
were
arguing
in
support
of
her.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
they
indicated
on
their
face
that
these
are
legislative
proposals
that
will
be
submitted
but
they
haven't
been
adopted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that
was
clear
on
the
face.
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
they...
the
attorney
general
can't
preclear
the
contents
of
the
materials
that
are
handed
to
people
to
register
for
federal
elections--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
that
it
is
clear
to
those
people
that
they
will
be
registered
only
for
federal
purposes
and
not
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
natural
part--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
preclearance
part.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
talking
about
the
materials
submitted
to
the
people
who
come
in
to
get
a
driver's
license,
and
the
language
used
to
explain
to
the
voters
in
mississippi
the
mississippi
position,
that
you
will
be
registered
for
federal
elections
only.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
to
register
for
the
state
you
have
to
do
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
presumably
the
attorney
general
could
take
objection
to
mississippi's
apparent
failure
to
advise
voters
of
the
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
a
what-if
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
and
think
this
whole
preclearance
bubble...
mess...
doesn't
amount
to
anything.
it's
a
nullity.
you're
out
and
they're
out.
nothing's
precleared.
now
what
do
you
have
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let's
just
suppose
that's
what
we
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
probably
forms
that
make
clear
to
people
who
register
at
driver's
license
time
that
they
are
not
registered
thereby
for
state
and
local
elections.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
might.
