mr.
robert
e.
sanders
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
first
question,
that
being
whether
base
implementation
by
a
state
of
the
requirements
of
the
national
voter
registration
act
are
subject
to
section
5
preclearance,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
clearly
is
no.
when
the
congress
mandates
that
a
state
implement
the
matters
set
forth
in
the
national
voter
registration
act,
the
state
has
no
discretion
about
whether
to
do
that.
if
the
attorney
general
is
asserting
a
right
of
review,
that
means
necessarily
that
the
attorney
general
is
asserting
a
right
to
object
to
mississippi's
implementation
of
the
congressional
mandate.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
no,
your
honor.
there
are
a
couple
of
areas
where
the
state
has
a
very
small
amount
of
discretion.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
possibly.
the--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well...
all
right,
i'll
say
yes
if
the
amount
of
discretion
is
considered
to
be
significant.
the
nvra--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
discretion
in
implementing
the
mandates
of
the
nvra,
arguably
those
discretionary--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--are
subject
to
preclearance.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
oh,
yes
they
were,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
the--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
on
parts
of
it
there
was
no
duty.
on
those
parts
that
are
strictly
mandatory...
for
instance,
putting
nvra
forms
at
driver's
license
stations...
there's
no
discretion
about
that.
the
congress
says,
thou
shalt
do
that,
and
we
can't,
we
can't...
we
have
no
discretion
there,
and
the
attorney
general
may
not
veto
that
part
or
object
under
the
section
5
device.
there
are...
the
congress
also
said
that
you
shall
put
certain
of
these
nvra
forms
at
certain
agencies
that
provide
public
assistance.
it
left
it
up
to
the
states
to
determine
which
agencies
fit
that
description.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
we
made
a
designation
of
five
or
six
agencies,
and
arguably--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--yes,
sir,
and
it
was
precleared.
that
was
part
of--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
we
characterize
her
actions
as
both
erroneous
and
partly
as
a
rogue
official.
the
reference
to
a
rogue
official
was
more
to...
for
illustration.
her
action
was
erroneous
primarily
to
the
extent
that
she
purported
to
submit
material
that
required
legislative
change--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--no
one
did.
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
any
responsible
state
official
may
make
a
submission.
to
the
extent
that
she
submitted
things
that
were
administratively
changed,
as
justice
stevens
asked
about,
those
were
legitimate
submissions.
anything
beyond
that,
anything
that
she
purported
to
submit
that
required
legislative
preclear...
or
legislative
change,
simply
were
not.
they
were--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
well--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--all
right,
let
me
make
clear--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--let
me
make
clear--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--those
purported
changes
that
required
legislative
action,
we
submit,
were
not
properly
precleared.
they
could
not
submitted
for
preclearance.
those
actions--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--i
understand.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
yes,
such
as
the--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--all
right.
the
nvra
form
itself,
the
state
has
some
discretion,
arguably,
about
what
to
include
in
that.
the
federal
election
commission
has
the
responsibility
of
setting
forth
which
elements
must
be
contained
in
the
nvra
form.
the
state
of
mississippi
may
incorporate
into
that
form
its
own
voter
disqualifications,
such
as
conviction
of
certain
crimes
and
so
forth.
the
state
of
mississippi
did
that.
that
form
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
precleared
that
form
on
february
1.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
plaintiffs
refer
to
as
the
context
argument,
that
the
context
of
the
submission
was
different
than
the
context
of
the
implementation
of
that
which
was
submitted.
there
is
a
very
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind.
section
5
has...
prescribes
a
60-day
period
for
reviewing
submissions.
section
5
also,
by
the
express
language,
says
that
if
the
attorney
general
within
that
60-day
period
decides
not
to
object
within
that
60-day
period,
but
that
the
attorney
general
receives
additional
information
within
that
60-day
period,
the
attorney
general
may
lodge
a
conditional
objection
pending
an
opportunity
to
review
that
additional
material.
now,
the
60-day
period
began
here
on
december
20,
1994
and
it
ended
on
february
18,
1995.
the
attorney...
or,
the
department
of
justice
on
february
16,
1995,
2
days
before
that
60-day
period
ended,
wrote
a
letter
setting
forth
that
they
believed
that
what
we
were
doing
was
instituting
a
dual
registration
system,
but
the
attorney
general
never
did
anything
to
diminish
the
preclearance
that
she
had
granted
on
february
1,
1995.
it
cannot
be
said
that
on
february
16
or
february
18,
also
the
day
that
the
60-day
period
ended,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
attorney
general
at
that
point
did
not
understand
fully
the
context
of
what
she
precleared
on
february
1.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
yes.
to
the
extent
that
the
submission
included
purported
changes,
or
proposed
changes
of
statutory
law,
you're
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
and
were
precleared,
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
to
the
extent
that
they
represent
significant
discretion,
they
must
be
precleared.
it's
like
mcdaniel
v.
sanchez,
when
the
court
said
that
court
imposed
election
remedies
need
not
be
precleared
unless
there
is
significant
voter
jurisdiction
input
into
that
plan.
it
makes
that
distinction,
and
i
would
say
the
same
thing
applies
here.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
significant
discretion
in
mississippi's
input,
then
it
does
require
preclearance.
i'm
not
certain,
however,
that
the
very
limited
things
that
we
do
when
we
designate
which
agencies
fit
the
description
of
public
assistance
agencies,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
enough
mississippi
input
to
require
those
things
to
be
submitted
for
preclearance,
but
to
the
extent
that
that
is
enough,
they
were
submitted
and
they
were
precleared.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
well,
of
course,
the
national
voter
registration
act
doesn't
require
that
we
set
forth
any
such
disclaimer
or
warning.
it
simply
requires
that
we
put
certain
forms
at
certain
locations,
and
that's
what
we
did.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
all
right.
yes,
your
honor,
i
don't
quarrel
with
that.
the
fact
is,
we
are
informing
people
when
they
come
in
to
register
of
the
status
that
they
will
obtain
by
virtue
of
that
registration,
and
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
we
now
inform
people,
i
don't
think
the
conveyance
of
information
is
a
change
within
section
5
that
requires
preclearance.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
well,
it
just...
the
first
submission
did
not
contemplate
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
again--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--that's
true,
yes,
sir,
but
i
would
just
contend
that
the
transmission
of
information,
helping
someone
understand
his
or
her
voting
status,
is
not
a
change
in
any
event,
especially
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
i
don't
think
that
if
a
circuit
clerk
or
the
secretary
of
state
wanted
to
inform
someone
of
what
their
voting
status
was,
the
names
of
the
persons
on
the
ballot
or
anything
else,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
require--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
it's
a
new
form
mandated
by
the
congress,
of
course.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
virtually
all
of
it.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
the
fec
requires,
or
allows
us
to
incorporate
into
the
form
those...
as
i
said,
those
things
that
would
disqualify--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
of
course,
if
the
attorney...
if
the
mississippi
attorney
general's
office
had
known
at
the
time
that
a
submission
was
about
to
have
been
made,
a
lot
of
things
would
have
been
done
differently.
the
fact
is
here
that
the
department
of
justice
interjected
itself
into
the
mississippi
matters.
it
pressured--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
i
beg
to
differ,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
department
of
justice
triggered
this
hasty
submission.
they
called
and
wrote
to
a
person
who
is
employed
with
the
secretary
of
state's
office
on
several
occasions,
prompting
them
to
go
ahead
and
submit
a
preclearance,
and
frankly
i
think
it
was
their
behavior
that
caused
this
false
start,
as
justice
scalia
referred
to
it
as.
it's
not
the
fact
that
mississippi
has
tried
to
deceive
the
department
of
justice
by
any
stretch.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
yes--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
but
i
contend
they
were
precleared.
the
february
1
letter
says
that
they
are
precleared.
the
only
thing
different
is
the
context,
and
by
february
16,
well
within
the
60-day
period
to
lodge
a
conditional
objection,
they
ratified
the
original
preclearance.
there...
i
don't
think
there's
any...
there
can
be
any
meaningful
dispute
that
they
understood
on
february
16--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--no,
ma'am,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
the
fact...
the
60-day
period
just
makes
the
case
stronger,
but
i
think
it's
beyond
dispute
that
the
department
of
justice
knew
that
those
statutory
changes,
or
that
the
law
surrounding
voter...
mississippi
registration
qualification
was
embodied
in
state
statutes,
and
that
law
could
not
be
changed
unless
those
statutes
were
changed.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
okay.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
well,
i
think
any
state-initiated
change
has
to
be
precleared.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
well,
it
is
largely
dictated,
and
is
almost
exclusively
dictated
by
the
federal
election
commission.
that's
what
the
nvra
requires
the
federal...
the
fec
to
do.
the
state
of
mississippi
has
very
little
input
into
the
construction
of
that
form.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
arguably.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
no,
i'm
just
saying...
what
i'm
saying
is,
arguably
it
did.
if
it
did,
we
got
the
preclearance.
now,
if
we
want
to
really
examine
the--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--no,
not
one
that's
initiated
by
the
state
and
subject
to
section
5
preclearance.
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
no.
my
position
hasn't
changed.
i
just...
i
didn't
want...
i...
the
fact
that
they
were
precleared
seemed
to
me
to--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
all
right.
well,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
has
promulgated
a
regulation
that
carries
out
this
part
of
the
language
of
section
5...
it's
at
28
c.f.r.
section
51.23...
that
expressly
gives
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
lodge
a
conditional
objection.
there's
no
way
you
can
read
the
february
16
letter
to
lodge
a
conditional
objection--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--that's
correct,
and
they
suggest
that
we
submit
a...
make
another
submission,
but
they
never
do
anything
to
diminish
the
fact
that
they
precleared
those
agency
selections,
they
precleared
the
form,
their--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
my
position
is
in
the
february
16
letter
all
they
had
to
do
was
say,
well,
if
this
is
not
part
of
a
unitary
system,
then
we
hereby
lodge
a
conditional
objection
and
we
will
resolve
it
later
on.
that's
what
their
own
regulation
says
they
have
the
authority
to
do,
and
they
do
not
do
it.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
all
right.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
well--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--all
right.
i
certainly
would
not
have
to
submit
any
notion
that
there
has
been
a
change
of
state
law.
clearly
there
has
not
been.
i
would
not
have
to
submit
any
of
the
things
that
amount
to
base
compliance...
or
i
mean,
that
amount
to
implementation
of
the
base
requirements
of
the
nvra.
again,
at
most
i
would
have
to
submit
those
matters...
the
designation
of
agencies,
the
construction
of
the
form,
and
the--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--oh,
certainly
i
think
if
this
court
were
to
remand
we
might
make
that
change,
but
frankly
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
i
do
not--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--no,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
that
it
amounts
to
enough,
but
certainly--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
frankly,
i
mean,
i
didn't
put
as
much--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--that's
correct.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
right.
the
construction
of
the
form
the
state
had--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
really
what--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--as
i
indicated
earlier
the
nvra
says
that
persons
may
register--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--if
the
state
of
mississippi
had
decided
to
put
a
lot
of
additional
material
on
the
form,
then
we
would
have
been
constructing
in
a
material
sense.
if
we
had...
i
can't
think
of
an
example,
but
if
we
had
put
a
great
deal
more
material
on
there.
all
we
actually
put
on
there
were
those
things
that
would
disqualify
someone.
the
nvra
form
has
a
voter
declaration
section
and
all
the
person
needs
to
do
is
sign
his
name
below
this
declaration
which
says,
i
have
not
been
convicted
of
these
certain
crimes,
i
am
over
18...
in
other
words
it
incorporates
mississippi's
qualifications.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
now...
so
mississippi
put
mississippi's
qualifications
in
there.
i
suppose
alabama
put
alabama's
qualifications
in
there.
so
to
that
extent
it
is
somewhat
different
than
the
base
form,
from
the
fec--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--i'm
just...
no.
i
say
that
arguably
if...
i
don't
know
whether
just
filling
out
that
part
and
putting
our
state
qualifications
is
enough.
frankly,
i
don't
think
it
is.
i'm
just
saying
arguably
it
could
be,
but
i
think
clearly
if
we
went
further
than
that,
if
we
put
other
material
in
there,
the
more
we
put
into
it--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
not
putting
something
in
there
amounts
to
a
section
5
change.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
well,
all
right.
i'll
state
it
in
the
affirmative.
i
don't
think
that
not
putting
that
is
a
section
5
change,
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
well,
i
think
at
most
of
course
you
should
just
simply
remand
it.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
should
in
any
way
render
a
decision
on...
without
going
back
to
the
district
court,
but
i
think
still,
to
the
extent
that
anyone
considers
that
a
change
has
been
made,
i
think
that
it's
still
something
that
section
5,
the
district
court
should
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at.
if
the
court
feels
that
more
proof
should
be
developed
and
so
forth
through
discovery,
i
mean,
that
can
be
done,
but
the
very
most
that
this
court
should
do
is
remand
to
the
district
court,
if
that's
what
your
question
is.
i--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
and
your
honor--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--well,
obviously
through
a
section
2
challenge
or
any
fifteenth
amendment-based
challenge,
but
our
position
is
that
the
attorney
general
should
not
be
able
to
do
that
through
the
device
of
section
5
preclearance.
again,
we
do
not
think
that
the
attorney
general
should
be
able
to
review,
object,
or
veto
any
mandate
to
the
state
of
mississippi
from
the
congress,
but
they
have
plenty
of
other
options
available
to
it.
to
the
extent,
as
my
good
friend
mr.
stewart
said,
that
base
implementation
of
the
nvra
might
amount
to
a
discriminatory
purpose,
if
it
does,
then
the
united
states
may
challenge
that
in
a
variety
of
other
ways
but
not
through
the
device
of
preclearance.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
i
read
that
language
in
the
nvra
simply
to
mean
the
same...
or
i
read
it
the
same
way
i
read
footnote
29
in
allen,
where
this
court
says
that
state-initiated
changes,
even
when
made
to
comply
with
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
must
be
submitted
for
preclearance.
i
read
that
language
in
the
nvra
the
same
way.
when
the
state
makes
changes
itself,
they
must
be
submitted
for
preclearance
even
though
they
are
part
of
an
nvra--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--not
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
no.
i
don't
think
that
language
in
the
nvra
was
designed
to
give
the
attorney
general
the
right
of
veto
over
an
act
of
congress,
over
a
mandate
from
the
congress.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
if
it
was
just
a--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--absolutely
not.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
new
about
circuit
clerks
or
secretary
of
states
or
any
elected
official--
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
--it
doesn't
matter,
your
honor.
if
it's
just
designed
to
convey
information
to
the
electorate,
no,
that's
not
a
change
in
any
sense.
mr.
robert
e.
sanders
no,
of
course
not.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
person's
ability
to
vote.
it
simply
is...
if
we're
trying
to
inform
them
of
their
status,
that
does
not
represent
a
change
for
section
5
purposes
or
for
any
other
purposes
so
far
as
i
can
see.
that
is
simply...
i
mean,
all
elected
officials
have
always
done
what
they
can
to
help
people...
to
help
their
constituents.
that's
just
currying
favor
with
voters,
and
that
does
not
represent
a
section
5
change.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
