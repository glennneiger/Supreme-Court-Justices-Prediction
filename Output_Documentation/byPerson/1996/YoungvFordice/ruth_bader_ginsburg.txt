justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
isn't
all
of
that
premature?
i
thought
the
simple
point
is,
there's
been
a
change.
every
change
has
to
be
precleared,
period.
now,
the
attorney
general
may
agree
with
your
point
of
view
or
disagree.
we
don't
know
that
at
this
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
we
know
is
that
we
have
a
change
prompted
by
the
federal
law.
everybody
concedes
that
it
is
a
change
that
needs
to
be
precleared.
why
should
we
look
at
anything
more
than
that
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
even
what
constitutes
a
satisfactory
submission.
that's
for
the
attorney
general
to
decide
in
the
first
instance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when...
well,
i
just
wanted
to
ask
about
your
benchmark
view.
if
the
interim
january
to
february
10th,
if
that
was
not
the
system
that
mississippi
ever
lawfully
adopted,
then
why
shouldn't
our
only
benchmark
be
what
was
before
the
federal
act
became
effective?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
an
unlawful
system,
they
just
couldn't
treat
that
as
a
nullity
and
say,
we
had
a
pre-january
1
system
and
a
lawful
post-january
1
system?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
just
give
them
notice?
just
give
them
notice
that
their,
what
they
registered
for
counts
only
for
the
federal
elections?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
your
position
that
in
a
picture
like
this
the
state
would
be
required
to
preclear
twice?
suppose
mississippi
took
the
position,
we
haven't
yet
gotten
this
legislation.
we
don't
know
if
we
will.
could
they
have
let
january
1
come
and
go
without
filing
anything
on
an
interim
basis
and
then
waited
till
they
found
out
what
happened
with
the
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't
under
your
view.
if
i
understood
your
brief,
you
said
that
a
certain
state
official
did
a
rogue
act,
that
the
december
20
submission
was
without
any
authority,
that
ms.
slaughter-harvey
acted
on
her
own
without
authority,
without
anybody
in
mississippi
approving
that,
so
if
one
takes
you...
takes
that
characterization
of
it,
it
is
as
though
the
december
20
submission
never
happened.
it
was
totally
unauthorized.
it
was
not
mississippi's
submission,
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
mustn't
there
be
a
legitimate
preclearance
application?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
you
said
nobody
knew
of
her
december
20
letter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sanders,
wouldn't
the
most
important
thing
to
preclear,
perhaps
the
only
thing
once
mississippi
decides
it's
going
to
do
a
different
federal-only
registration,
is
to
tell
people
who
come
into
the
motor
vehicle
bureau
in
big
letters,
this
will
register
you
for
federal
elections
only,
and
such
a
thing
was
never
precleared
because
the
first
submission
didn't
suppose
there
was
going
to
be
that
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sanders,
if
there
had
been
no--
--you
mean
the--
--december
20,
then
do
you
agree
that
there
would
have
had
to
have
been
a
preclearance
of
what
was
agreed
upon
on
february
10
to
keep
the
mississippi
system?
forget
about...
there
had
never
been
any
december
20
submission.
on
february
10
the
state
of
mississippi
knows
what
it's
going
to
do.
does
that
have
to
be
precleared?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
talking
about
the
state
registration,
just
the
federal
registration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
change.
it's
something
new,
forced
by
federal
law,
but
still
it's
a
change
in
the
voting
practice.
doesn't
that
have
to
be
precleared?
i
thought
that
any
change
had
to
be
precleared.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state
is
initiating
a
form
that
isn't
dictated
in
every
particular
by
congress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you...
what
your
answer
to
me
now
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
you
repeated
twice
in
your
brief
when
you
said
that
the
statute
requires
preclearance
of
any
change,
and
that
arguably--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
now
you're
changing
your
arguably
to
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
your
brief
you
said
twice
the
choice
of
nvra
forms
those
agencies
would
use
were
administrative
changes
affecting
voting
that
arguably
required
section
5
preclearance,
and
now
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
you're
saying
you
were
wrong
to
say
arguably
require
preclearance
because
they
weren't
changes
that
needed
preclearance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
it
twice
so
you
must
have
thought
about
it.
