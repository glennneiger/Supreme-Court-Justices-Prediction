ms.
brenda
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
because
the
state
of
mississippi,
since
early
1995,
has
been
conducting
voter
registration
under
procedures
that
have
not
been
submitted
for
preclearance
to
the
united
states
attorney
general
or
to
the
d.c.
district
court,
as
required
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
because
the
section
5
preclearance
requirement
is
so
critical
in
protecting
the
right
to
vote
in
states
such
as
mississippi,
congress
expressly
provided
in
the
national
voter
registration
act
of
1993,
the
nvra,
that
states
must
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act
in
implementing
the
nvra.
now,
the
procedures
that
mississippi
ultimately
decided
upon
in
implementing
the
nvra
established
a
twotier
or
dual
system
under
which
citizens
who
register
under
the
provisions
of
the
nvra
must
also
register
separately
to
be
able
to
vote
in
state
elections,
and
a
plan
that
implements
the
nvra
through
that
type
of
dual
system
reflects
a
change
from
the
voter
registration
system
that
mississippi
had
in
effect
prior
to
19--
ms.
brenda
wright
--yes,
it
could
your
honor.
if
the
procedures
that
the
state
adopted
were
found
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
d.c.
district
court
to
be
discriminatory
in
purpose
or
effect,
that
objection
could
be
made,
and--
ms.
brenda
wright
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case--
ms.
brenda
wright
--it
doesn't
require
that,
that
is
true.
it
leaves
that
decision
up
to
the
states,
but--
ms.
brenda
wright
--well,
it
depends
in
part
upon
the
state's
specific
history
and
the
practices
it
had.
ms.
brenda
wright
mississippi
had
a
unitary
system
by
statute
at
the
time
the
nvra
came
into
effect.
ms.
brenda
wright
and
we
contend
that
the
implementation
of
a
dual
system
reflects
a
change
from
that
unitary
system.
ms.
brenda
wright
but
you
have
a--
ms.
brenda
wright
--well,
our
contention
is
this.
ms.
brenda
wright
leaving
the
false
start
out
of
it,
you
now
have
a
system
under
which
there
is
a
class
of
citizens
that
once
registered
is
not
permitted
to
vote
in
state
and
local
elections,
and
that
is
not
a
unitary
system
under
any
meaningful
sense
of
the
term.
ms.
brenda
wright
there
was
no
system
of
multiple
registration,
though,
because
one
registration
made
you
eligible
for
all
purposes.
ms.
brenda
wright
and
the
real
purpose
of
our
lawsuit
here
is
to
say
that
whatever
choices
mississippi
made
in
implementing
the
nvra,
whatever
plan
it
decided
to
adopt
ultimately
had
to
be
submitted
for
preclearance
so
that
the
attorney
general
could
review
exactly
how
that
procedure
was
going
to
be
implemented,
and
there
are
many,
many
discretionary
choices
that
a
state
makes
in
deciding
to
set
up
a
system
either
on
a
dual
basis
or,
even
if
it's
on
a
dual
basis,
there
are
different
ways
and
different
choices
that
a
state
makes
that
will
have
a
major
impact
on
whether
the
voters--
ms.
brenda
wright
--that's
right,
and
also,
for
example,
the
registration
forms
themselves.
in
the,
the
nvra
forms
that
are
currently
in
effect
and
are
being
handed
out
at
the
state
agencies
do
not
say
anything
about
limited
registration.
you
have
forms,
for
example,
that
are
being
handed
out
at
the
public
assistance
agencies
that
are
entitled,
mississippi
voter
registration
application,
and
nothing
on
the
form
tells
you
that
when
you
fill
that
out
you're
only
going
to
be
eligible
to
vote
in
state
and
local
elections,
so
it
was
vital
for
the
attorney
general--
ms.
brenda
wright
--in
federal...
that
you
would
only
be
able
to
vote
in
federal
elections,
that's
correct,
and
so
it
was
vital,
because
of
the
risk
of
confusion,
and
the
risk
of
people
believing
that
they
may
already
be
registered
for
all
purposes
when
in
fact
they
are
not
that
the
attorney
general
reviewed
these
procedures,
each
and
every
one
of
them.
ms.
brenda
wright
but
if
there
were
evidence
before
the
d.c.
district
court
or
the
attorney
general
that
a
dual
system
had
been
reinstated
for
the
very
purpose
of
discriminating
against
minority
citizens,
certainly--
ms.
brenda
wright
--but
your
honor,
the
cases
such
as
city
of
lockhart
v.
united
states
recognize
that
even
when
a
state
maintains
certain
procedures
but
changes
other
aspects
of
its
registration
system,
the
procedures
that
are
unchanged
themselves
may
be
subject
to
section
5
review.
ms.
brenda
wright
but
cases
such
as
city
of
lockhart
recognize...
in
that
case
the
numbered
post
requirement
had
not
been
changed
at
all.
ms.
brenda
wright
no,
it
was
not,
but
it
was
a
situation
where
one
provision
that
called
for
numbered
post
remained
unchanged,
and
the
court
held
that
it
nevertheless
was
a
change
when
the
city
applied
that
numbered
post
requirement
to
an
election
system
where
additional
seats
had
been
added,
because
the
court
held
that
you
have
to
examine
a
change
in
the
context
of
the
entire
election
system.
ms.
brenda
wright
but
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
examine
the
effect
that
this
particular
method
of
implementation
will
have
on
voting
and
registration
in
state
and
local
elections.
ms.
brenda
wright
well--
ms.
brenda
wright
--we
argue,
your
honor,
that
because
of
the
decision
in
allen
v.
state
board
of
elections
it's
clear
that
even
if
a
change,
a
particular
change
is
mandated
by
the
voting
rights
act
itself,
it
is
subject
to
preclearance
requirements.
ms.
brenda
wright
no.
that
question
will
arise
when
and
if
the
procedures--
ms.
brenda
wright
--well--
ms.
brenda
wright
--the
question
of
actual
discriminatory
intent
or
effect
is
not
before
this
court
and
it
was
not
before
the
court
below,
and
that
is
why
we
contend
that
the
court
exceeded
its
jurisdiction.
ms.
brenda
wright
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
i'm
simply--
ms.
brenda
wright
--that's
right.
we
contend
that
the
procedures
establishing
a
dual
system,
all
of
them,
need
to
be
submitted
for
preclearance.
ms.
brenda
wright
that
is
correct.
ms.
brenda
wright
well,
we
certainly
agree
that
there
is
no
necessity
of
determining
what
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the--
ms.
brenda
wright
--yes.
ms.
brenda
wright
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
wright
yes.
ms.
brenda
wright
it
need
not
gubmit
those
procedures,
but
we
do
believe
that
if
the
state
is
going
to
change
from
its
current
statutory
policy
of
a
unitary
system
it
does
need
to
obtain
preclearance
for
that
alteration
of
its
important
policy,
and
that
would
be
part
of--
ms.
brenda
wright
--because
it's
current...
but
that's
only
because
its
current
system
contemplates
a
unitary
system
of
registration,
and
i
do
want
to
emphasize
the
very
narrow
character
of
the
inquiry
that
we
have
here.
the
only
inquiry
is
whether
there
has
been
a
change
and
whether,
if
there
has
been
a
change,
that
change
has
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
ms.
brenda
wright
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
wright
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
wright
i
believe
allen
v.
state
board
of
elections
and
mcdaniel
v.--
ms.
brenda
wright
--yes.
it
was
an
implementation
of
the
voting
rights
act.
virginia
was
implementing
the
voting
rights
act
by
providing
assistance
to
illiterate
voters,
and
the
allen
case
held
that
the
changes
providing
that
there
was...
that
that
assistance
had
to
be
given
was
subject
to
the
preclearance
requirement
of
section
5,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that--
ms.
brenda
wright
--well,
we
contend
that--
ms.
brenda
wright
--that
comes
into
play,
though,
because
of
mississippi's
clear
statutory
policy
of
having
a
unitary
registration
system.
ms.
brenda
wright
well,
we
do
argue--
ms.
brenda
wright
--what
we
argue,
your
honor,
is
that
the
state
has
been
highly
selective
in
deciding
which
provisions
of
existing
mississippi
law
it
must
continue
to
comply
with
and
which
it
cannot
change.
we
believe
that
the
important
state
policy
of
a
unitary
registration
system
is
clearly
far
greater
in
importance
to
the
state
than
the
provision
of
an
attesting
witness
requirement
in
a
mail-in
form,
which
is
really
the
only
provision
here
that
mississippi
has
identified
as
a
bar
to
implementing
the
registration--
ms.
brenda
wright
--on
a
unitary
basis.
ms.
brenda
wright
we
would
argue
from
the
perspective
of
the
voters
it
certainly
is
not
the
least
change
possible,
because
if
you
think
about
election
day
the
registrars
are
now
required
to
keep
two
sets
of
poll
books,
one
for
nvra
registrants
only
allowed
to
vote
in
federal
elections,
and
one
for
other
registrants.
presumably
if
you
go
into
the
voting
booth
you
have
to
get
a
separate
ballot,
because
if
there
are
both
federal
and
state
elections
on
the
ballot
you
can't
be
permitted
to
vote
that
ballot,
and
so
these
types
of
changes,
these
types
of--
ms.
brenda
wright
--but
your
honor--
ms.
brenda
wright
--but
because
the
nvra
does
require
that
the
states
administer
these
procedures,
the
state,
we
contend,
has
an
obligation
to
identify
exactly
how
it
wants
to
go
about
implementing
the
nvra
and
obtain
preclearance
for
all
of
those
decisions
specifically
spelled
out
in
a
proceeding
either
before
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
d.c.
district
court,
and
that
is
what
has
not
happened
here.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
brenda
wright
well,
the...
yes.
we
are
arguing
that
the
system
that
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
december
of
1994
was
a
system
that
contemplated
a
unitary--
ms.
brenda
wright
--set
of
procedures.
ms.
brenda
wright
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
wright
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
wright
we
believe
that
mississippi
is
following
the
provisions
as
they
respect
federal
elections.
ms.
brenda
wright
but
there
are
further
differences
because
of...
by
necessity,
when
you
implement
a
dual
system
you
have
to
make
changes
in
your
practices
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
you
now
have
two
separate
sets
of
registration
requirements
that
may
result
in
confusion
for
voters.
so
we
say
that
as
a
package
the
decision
to
implement
these
procedures
on
a
federal-election-only
basis
really
need
to
be
submitted
and
reviewed
on
that
basis.
ms.
brenda
wright
well,
we
contend
that
it's
not
necessary
to
determine
the
status
of
those
early
1995
procedures
in
order
to
dispose
of
this
case,
but
we
do
contend
that
mississippi
was
actually
implementing
a
unitary
nvra
plan,
and
that
it
could
not
make
a
change
from
that
system
that
was
in
effect
in
the
early
part
of
1995.
ms.
brenda
wright
we
contend
no,
because
you
simply
cannot
treat
as
a
nullity
the
registration
of
thousands
of
voters
who
registered
under
the
assumption
that
they
were
eligible
for
all
elections.
that
would
be--
ms.
brenda
wright
--preclearance
would
have
to
be
obtained
for
a
change
that
makes
such
a
dramatic
difference
in
the
registration
status
of
so
many
voters.
that's
part
of
our
contention.
ms.
brenda
wright
well,
we
contend
that
even
though
only
some
of
the
circuit
clerks
put
voters
actually
on
the
rolls
for
all
purposes,
the
unitary
nvra
plan
was
actually
being
implemented
on
a
state-wide
basis,
because
in
each
of
these
counties
when
you
went
into
the
agencies
the
forms
that
you
were
being
given
and
the
procedures
that
were
being
followed
were
to
the
knowledge
of
the
voters
procedures
registering
you
for
all
elections,
and
that
was
going
on
in
every
county
regardless
of
whether
the
circuit
clerks
immediately
put
you
on
the
rolls
for
all
purposes,
and
that's
how
we
say
there
was
in
fact
state-wide
implementation
here.
i'd
like
to
reserve.
