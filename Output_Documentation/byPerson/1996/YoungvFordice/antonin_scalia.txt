justice
antonin
scalia
it
still
does
have
the
same
unitary
system
in
place.
you
can
still
register
for
both
federal
and
state
elections
the
same
way
you
could
before
the
nvra
provisions
went
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you
have
an
additional
option.
if
you
want
to
use
the
easier
method
you
can
register
for
federal
elections,
but
as
far
as
what
a
citizen
of
mississippi
can
do
by
way
of
registering
for
both
state
and
federal,
it
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
before,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
for
the
false
start.
let's
leave
the
false
start
out
of
the
mix
for
the
moment.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
reason
of
the
special
grace
provided
by
the
federal
statute,
but
the
same
system
that
existed
for
multiple
registration
prior
to
the
nvra
is
still
in
place
in
mississippi.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wright,
why--
--that's
fair
enough
when
it's
voluntary
on
the
part
of
the
state.
where
one
change
is
made
voluntarily
on
the
part
of
the
state
you
can
say
well,
the
whole
thing
gets
sucked
in,
but
this
is
a
unique
situation
in
which
a
certain
change
is
imposed
upon
the
state
by
the
federal
government.
now,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
way
in
which
you
implement
that
mandatory
change
must
be
cleared
with
the
attorney
general.
that's
one
thing.
but
it's
quite
something
else
to
say
that
because
the
federal
government
has
mandated
this
change
all
of
your
current
system
which
you
have
not
changed
at
all
has
to
be
resubmitted
for
clearance
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
its
effect
is
is
the
fault
of
the
federal
government,
so
long
as
the
procedures
for
implementing
the
federal
scheme
themselves
are
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it
may
discourage
people
from
voting
in
state
elections
who
find
it
easier
to
register
for
federal
only,
but
that's
the
congress'
fault
for
applying
this
new
system
only
to
federal
elections.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
what
we're--
--no.
--we're
arguing
about
here.
it's
not
whether
the
procedures
for
implementing
the
federal
act
have
to
be
cleared,
but
whether
there
gets
sucked
along
with
that
the
procedures
that
the
state
has
had
in
place
for
many
years
for
registering
under
the
state
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
not
involved
in
any
earlier
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
pick
on
that
and
you
say
that
that
has
been
changed.
well,
i
mean,
yes
you
can
say
that
that's
been
changed.
you
could
also
say,
however,
if
they
had
changed
it
to
a
unitary,
or
had
continued
a
unitary,
you
could
also
say
there
has
been
a
change
because
it
used
to
be
that
you
had
to,
in
order
to
register
for
the
state,
do
things
beyond
what
the
motor
vehicle
registration
act
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
a
loaded
question.
you
say
they...
you
focus
on
this
unitary
as
though
that's
the
center
of
the
universe.
i
don't
know
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
agree--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
ask
me
what
would
constitute
the
least
change
that
mississippi
could
make
in
order
to
comply
with
the
federal
law,
i
would
say
it
is
precisely
what
mississippi
did
here,
leave
its
current
registration
procedures
entirely
in
place.
if
you
want
to
register
for
state
and
federal
localities
at
the
same
time,
you
just
follow
what
mississippi
has
had
in
place
for
years,
and
add
to
that
what
the
federal
government
has
required
to
be
added:
motor
vehicle
registration
for
federal
elections.
that
seems
to
me
the
minimal
change
possible
from
the
state
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
problem.
just
register
under
the
state
procedures
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
the
way
it
was
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wright,
as
i
understood
your
submission,
it
is
not
that
the
whole
state
was
acting
de
facto
this
way,
although
unlawfully.
it's
that
only
a
certain
number
of
counties
were.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
possibly
leap
to
the
position
that
the
entire
state
of
mississippi,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
that
the
entire
state
of
mississippi
was
de
facto
operating
under
a
unitary
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
it
did,
but
it
also
quite
clearly
and
on
its
very
face
presupposed
a
new
statute
that
hadn't
been
passed.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
that
not
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
you
had
state
law
that
said
this
is
how
you
register
for
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
have
to
be
a
very
good
lawyer
to
figure
that
out.
you
have
state
law
that
says,
this
is
how
you
register
for
state
elections.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
one
that
bars
it.
you
need
one
that
authorizes
it.
people
don't
get
the
ability
to
vote
unless
there's
a
law
that
says
they
don't
have
it.
they
need
a
law
that
says
they
do
have
it,
and
the
only
law
in
effect
is
one
that
said
this
is
how
you
get
to
vote
in
mississippi,
and
then
you
get
this
submission
from
mississippi
which
says,
we
are
now
going
to
let
people
vote
in
state
elections
on
the
basis
of
this
new
federal
law,
and
you
see
that
in
the
mississippi
statutes...
you
get
this
from
the
secretary
of
state,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
see
the
mississippi
statute
doesn't
permit
this.
i
cannot
imagine
that
you
people
at
the
justice
department
did
not
know...
did
not
know
that
this
thing
required
legislation
which
had
not
yet
been
passed.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
precleared
it,
or
purported
to
preclear
it...
she...
as
part
of
a
package
which
included...
which
included...
in
a
way,
you
two
sides
deserve
each
other.
[laughter]
the
attorney
general
purports
to
preclear
something
that
was
never
submitted,
and
you
purport
to
have
gotten
precleared
something
that
was
never
submitted.
it
was
submitted
as
a
whole
package.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
an
argument,
but
it's
a
bad
argument
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sanders,
i'm
reluctant,
as
some
others
seem
to
be
to
say
that
you
have
to
submit
forms
for
preclearance,
because
if
we
adopt
that
principle
we'll
have
to
use
it
not
just
in
this
case
but
in
all
cases
in
the
future,
and
the
notion
that
all
forms
are
submittable
whenever
you
make
any
change
is
a
rather
expansive
one.
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
also
concerned
that
the
justice
department
ought
to
be
able
to
protect
mississippi
voters
from
being
misled
when
they
register
under
what
is
a
federal-only
system
into
believing
that
they're
registered
under
state
law.
then
they
appear
at
the
state
voting
place
and
they
find
that
they
can't
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
can't
be
sure
by
requiring
the
forms
to
be
submitted,
how
can
the
attorney
general
prevent
the
state
of
mississippi
from
misleading
citizens
that
way?
