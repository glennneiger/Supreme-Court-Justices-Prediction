we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-2031,
thomas
young
v.
kirk
fordice.
ms.
wright.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
in
connection
with
the
federal
voter
registration
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
argument
goes
considerably
further
than
allen,
which
itself
went
to
me
to
the
extreme
of
construing
this
statute.
may
i
ask,
ms.
wright,
i
just
want
to
be
sure,
i
didn't
think
the
questions
that
justice
o'connor
put
to
you
is
presented
by
this
case.
we
aren't
concerned
with
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
would
have
had
a
duty
to
preclear
if
there
had
been
a
submission,
are
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
change
was
brought
about
by
the
federal
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
not
by
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
none
of
our
cases
support
that,
do
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
change
brought
about
by
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
wright.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
not
contending
that
the
attorney
general
wouldn't
have
known
from
the
submission
that
the
statute
had
not,
in
fact,
been
passed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
sanders,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
conceding,
are
you,
that
the
publication
of
a
form
is
a
change
in
practice
or
procedure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
a
moment
ago
you
didn't
think
that
was
a
practice
or
procedure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sanders.
the
case
is
submitted.
