mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
point
i
would
like
to
stress
from
the
outset
is
that
the
potential
discriminatory
effects
of
mississippi's
current
system
with
which
the
department
of
justice
is
most
concerned
are
not
in
any
sense
the
product
of
federal
compulsion.
that
is,
the
nvra
does
require
the
states
to
take
certain
steps,
but
it
leaves
the
states
with
substantial
discretion
in
other
respects
not
only
as
to
the
initial
decision
as
to
whether
nvra
registrants
will
be
entitled
to
vote
in
state
and
local
elections,
but
also
with
respect
to
subsidiary
decisions
regarding
the
forms
that
will
be
used,
the
procedures
by
which
people
will
be
registered.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
as
well
that
we
think
we
are
not
being
fanciful
or
alarmist
in
suggesting
there
may
be
a
substantial
problem
with
telling
thousands
of
people
in
mississippi
that
they
are
registered
to
vote
in
mississippi
when
in
fact
they
are
not
eligible
to
cast
ballots
for
any
mississippi
official.
the
question
of
what
forms
are
being
used,
what
process
of
notification
is
given
to
nvra
registrants,
is
not
simply
a
technicality.
it
really
goes...
potentially
at
least
goes
to
the
heart
of
whether
mississippi's
current
system
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
the
state
had
made
clear
from
the
outset
that
it
intended
to
implement
the
nvra
on
a
federal
election-only
basis,
it
would
then
have
submitted
the
procedures--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
the
attorney
general
did
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
submission--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
attorney
general
certainly
could
not
appropriately
have
purported
to
preclear
legislation
that
had
not
been
passed.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
submission
did
include
the
draft
legislation,
but
it
also
included
procedures
for
implementing
the
nvra
beginning
on
january
1,
1995,
and
in
our
view
the
unmistakable
tenor
of
the
whole
submission
was
that
those
procedures
presupposed
a
regime
in
which
nvra
registrants
would
be
eligible
for
state
and
local
elections
as
well.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
with
respect,
the
statute
was
included,
but
the
submissions
did
not
make
clear
that
passage
of
a
statute
was
essential
to
treatment
of
nvra
registrations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
knew
from
the
submission
that
the
statute
had
not
been
passed.
we
didn't
know
from
the
submission
that
passage
of
the
statute
was
a
prerequisite
to
treatment
of
nvra
registrants
as
eligible
to
vote
in
state
and
local
elections.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
one
of
the
respects
in
which
this
record
is
fairly
hazy
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
fact,
mississippi
has
never
identified
with
any
clarity
the
precise
state
statute
which
is
supposed
to
bar
the
treatment
of
nvra
registrants
as
eligible
to
vote
in
state
and
local
elections.
there
is
no
state
statute
which
says,
voter
registration
applications--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
what
we
knew
was
that
the
state
had
begun
to
adopt
the
plan
outlined
in
the
submission
as
of
january
1,
1995,
and
again,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
state
could
decide
at
a
later
date
what
elections
these
people
were
registered
for.
it's
essential
that
a
person
who
comes
in
to
register
be
told
what
elections
he
is
eligible
to
vote
in,
so
it
wouldn't
have
been
appropriate
at
all
for
the
state
to
tell
people
you're
eligible
to
vote
in
all
elections
and
then
decide
at
a
later
date,
after
the
fate
of
the
legislation
was
determined,
whether
in
fact
that
would
be
the
case.
to
return
for
a
second
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
think
if
mississippi
had
told
us
from
the
outset
we
plan
to
do
this
for
federal
elections
only,
the
attorney
general
in
deciding
whether
to
issue
preclearance
would
have
had
to
decide
first
whether
there
was
discriminatory
purpose.
but
leaving
that
aside,
the
attorney
general
would
have
had
to
determine
whether
the
overall
system
contemplated
would
leave
minority
voters
in
a
worse
position
than
they
were
before
the
passage
of
the
nvra,
and
in
making
that
determination,
the
attorney
general
could
properly
consider
the
likely
ancillary
effects
on
voting
in
state
and
local
elections.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
we're
not...
we
acknowledge
that
the
nvra
itself
does
not
require
these
procedures
to
be
used
in
state
and
local
elections,
and
we're
not
arguing
that
the
attorney
general
has
some
blanket
authority
to
require
that
as
a
matter
of
her
own
discretion.
what
we're
saying--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
understand
that
to
be
ms.
wright's
position,
and
it
certainly
isn't
ours.
i
think
our
position
is
that
in
determining
whether
minorities
will
be
worse
off
after
mississippi
implements
the
nvra,
the
attorney
general
could
consider
not
only
the
likely
advantages
to
minority
voters
of
expedited
registration
procedures
in
federal
elections,
she
could
also
consider
whether
the
methods
by
which
mississippi
was
registering
nvra
voters
would
be
likely
to
confuse
them
and
thereby
dissuade
them
from--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
would
say
a
theoretical
possibility,
but
i
think
mississippi--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
at
least
our
primary
concern
at
this
point
is
that
the
method
by
which
mississippi
is
implementing
the
nvra
creates
a
particular
risk
that
nvra
registrants
will
be
dissuaded
from
registering
separately
for
state
and
local
elections,
because
the
forms
on
their
face
give
the
message
that
the
registrant
is
eligible
to
vote
in
all
elections.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
all
we
want
at
this--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
i
think
that
is
so.
all
we
want
at
this
point
is
the
opportunity
to
view
the
submission
and
to
determine
whether
there
are
any
likely
discriminatory
consequences,
and
with
respect
to
the
consequence
that
i
have
just
outlined,
the
possibility
for
confusion
based
upon
the
forms
and
procedures,
it
certainly
would
be
a
sufficient
response
for
mississippi
to
reformulate
those
forms
and
procedures
so
that
the
likelihood
of
confusion
is
diminished
or
eliminated.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
part
of
this--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
part
of
this
depends
upon
the
benchmark
that
would
be
used.
if,
as
we've
contended,
the
state
initially
implemented
a
unitary
system
of
nvra
registration
and
then
sought
to
change
that
system,
the
appropriate
remedy
pending
submission
of
a
new
package
of
materials
would
be
that
nvra
registrants
would
be
eligible
to
vote
in
all
elections
until
a
change
had
been
submitted
and
precleared.
this
court
has
recognized
often
that
the
question
of
whether
unlawful
elections
should
be
set
aside
is
distinct
from
the
question
of
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
5,
so
we
certainly
don't
think
that
the
consequence
of
requiring
a
new
preclearance
submission
would
necessarily
or
even
probably
be
that
any
elections
would
be
set
aside.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they
could
have
as
far
as
section
5
is
concerned
but
not
as
far
as
the...
well,
as
far
as
the
nvra
is
concerned,
they
would
have
been
required
to
implement
the
statute
for
federal
elections
because
of
the
effective
date
of
the
nvra
itself--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
section
5
would
have
precluded
their
doing
so
without
preclearance.
