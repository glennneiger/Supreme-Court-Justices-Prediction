justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
ask
you
a
fact
question?
i
thought
it
had
happened
in
the
sense
that
the
procedures
that
were
outlined
in
the
original
submission
for
the
application
of
the
new
federal
act
are,
in
fact,
the
ones
that
are
being
followed.
i
thought
the
contention
was
that
the
changes
in
the
old
state
procedures
which
were
outlined
in
that
submission
were
not
followed.
am
i
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
realize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
if
you
take
the
totality
of
the
submission,
that
totality
in
fact
has
not
been
followed.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
provisions
of
that
totality
have
not
been
followed.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
with
respect
to
the
provisions
for
the
implementation
of
the
federal
act,
have
they
been
followed
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
the
only
fact
difference,
then,
is
it
didn't
make
changes
to
conform
its
old
state
system
to
the
new
procedures
which
it,
which
everybody
agrees
it's
following
for
the
limited
federal
registration.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
way
to
cure
that
is
simply
to
deny
the
preclearance
with
respect
to
the
simple
implementation
of
the
federal
act.
that
doesn't
require
you
to
go
any
further
than
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
can
be
said,
can't
it,
that
what
the
attorney
general
precleared
was
what
you
submitted.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
you
submitted
does
not
conform
to
the
law
or
practice
of
mississippi
today.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
means
by
which
you
do
that,
however
you
are
informing
them,
has
never
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
has
never
been
precleared.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
premise
of
your
first
submission
was
that
you
wouldn't
be
telling
them
that,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
so
that
the
attorney
general
neither
had
before
her,
nor
precleared,
whatever
means
you
are
using
to
get
this
information
to
the
voters.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
didn't
you
also...
didn't
you
also
in
this
argument
just
a
moment
ago
in
responding
to
justice
o'connor
refer
to
the
need
to
submit
something
about
the
forms?
you
used
the
word
form.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
construction
of
the
form,
by
which
you
mean
the
format
and
its
content?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
mean
by
construction?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
just
for
a
second?
before
you
tell
me
that,
what...
i
just
want
to
know
what
you
meant
by
the
words
you
used.
you
spoke
of
the
construction
of
the
forms.
what
do
you
mean
by
construction
of
the
forms?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
agree
that
insofar
as
you
include
those,
in
effect
state
law
conditions
and
limitations
you
must
submit
the
form
for
preclearance.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
if
you
omitted
material.
for
example,
if
you
omitted
a
statement
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
under
mississippi
law
this
registration
would
be
good
for
federal
elections
only,
that
omission,
as
i
understand
it,
would
not
be
something
that
would
require
submission
for
preclearance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
you're
not
sure.
i
thought
your
position
was
going
to
be
that
you
were
sure
and
it
was
not
a
section
5
change
and
you
didn't
have
to
submit
it.
