stephen
g.
breyer
then
are
you
actually
asking
as
well
to
submit
all
the
changes
that
weren't
made?
i
thought
what
you
were
asking
for
is
that
what
has
to
be
submitted,
the
manner
in
which
they
carried
out
the
changes
required
by
the
voter
registration,
the
motor
voter
act,
and
that
would
be
judged
against
a
background
in
which
they
didn't
change
the
state
officials.
but
i
don't
understand...
i
agree,
i
don't
understand
why
they'd
have
to
submit
the
things
they
didn't
change.
i
suppose
they'd
have
to
submit
the
things
they
did
change,
and
then
you
would
argue
that
those
changes
are
unlawful
because
of
what
they
didn't--

g.
breyer
it
also
says
at
each
voter
registration
agency
the
following
services
shall
be
made
available:
assistance
to
applicants
in
completing
voter
registration
forms.
now,
perhaps
assistance
to
applicants
would
include
an
explanation
of
what's
going
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
what
should
we
do
if
we
think,
well,
you
haven't
submitted
the...
i
see
about
20
pages
here
in
this
statute.
it
has
a
lot
of
different
procedural
requirements,
and
maybe
some
are
absolutely
mandatory,
maybe
some
give
you
discretion.
if
we
send
it
back
and
say
you
have
to
preclear
those,
would
there
be
a
lot
of
argument
about
what
you
have
to
preclear
or
not?
i
mean,
what
would
you
suggest
we
do?
i
imagine
what
would
happen
is
you'd
have
to
preclear
those,
and
they'd
come
in
and
argue
that
in
light
of
the
dual
system
you
have
to
do
something
that's
virtually
impossible.
i
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
argue,
but
they're
going
to
argue
that
that
dual
system
is
highly
relevant,
and
you'll
argue
it
isn't.
all
right,
and...
so
what
in
your
opinion,
if
we...
just
what
justice
o'connor
asked,
i
think.
what
is
your
opinion
if
we
disagree
with
you
that
it
has
been
cleared,
and
we
think
it
hasn't
been
cleared
yet,
what
should
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
sanders--
--yes.
a
look
at
the
assistance
part
seems...
i
mean,
there
seems
to
be
some
words
here
about
their
having
to
provide
appropriate
assistance,
your
having
to,
to
people.
that
was
the
part
that
seemed
the
most
discretionary
when
i
just
glanced
at
it,
but
that
hasn't
been
argued
fully
here.
