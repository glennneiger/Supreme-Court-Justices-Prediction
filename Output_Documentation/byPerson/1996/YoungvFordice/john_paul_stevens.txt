justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
we
don't...
for
all
we
know
the
attorney
general
would
just
routinely
preclear
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
perhaps
she'd
act
wrongfully
if
she
refused
to,
but
that's
not
before
us,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
even
if
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
attorney
general
would
have
had
a
duty
to
preclear
the
existing
system,
you
would
nevertheless
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
there
were
no
discretionary
matters
that
the
state
could
decide
in
implementing
the
motor
vehicle
registration
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
with
respect
to
those,
was
there
a
duty
to
preclear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
the
standard
just
whether
there's
a
change?
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
have
been
precleared.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
were
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you,
is
it
your
position
that
there
was
no
duty
to
preclear,
or
that
you
did
get
preclearance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
not
that
designation
something
you
had
to
preclear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
counsel,
the
adoption
of
the
form
that
you
use
for
the
voter
to
fill
out
and
so
forth,
that
certainly
was
a
change,
wasn't
it?
it's
a
new
form.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
was
the
language...
all
the
language
in
the
form
mandated
by
congress?
justice
john
paul
stevens
virtually.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
fairly
clear
that
if
at
the
time
of
your
submission
you
had
realized
what
the
ultimate
outcome
would
have
been,
you
would
have
put
on
that
form,
this
is
good
only
for
federal
elections?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
didn't
interject
themselves.
congress
passed
a
statute
that
requires
preclearance
when
you
make
changes,
and
you
made
some
changes.
you
had
a
duty
to
get
preclearance,
so
you
triggered
the
preclearance
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
isn't
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
off
on
sort
of
a
tangent
about
whether
they
should
or
should
not
preclear
a
unitary
system
or
not,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very
simple
case.
even
the
most
modest
changes
under
the
motor
vehicle...
motor
voter
registration
act
needed
preclearance.
they
weren't
precleared.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
whether
they
should
be
precleared
is...
maybe
you're
dead
right
on
that.
they
probably
should
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
now
taking
the
position
the
forms
did
not
have
to
be
precleared?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
argument
that
they
were
precleared,
if
i
understood
you
before
justice
ginsburg
asked
you
some
other
questions,
was
that
the
february
16
letter
in
effect
ratified
the
prior
preclearance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
surely
not
a
fair
reading
of
that
letter,
which
is
asking...
which
is
telling
you
in
so
many
words
there's
been
no
preclearance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says,
a
review
of
this
matter
indicates
that
the
implementation
of
this
dual
voter
registration
system
and
purge
system
has
not
been
submitted
for
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
part
of
a
general
submission
that
you
say
was
improper,
and
which
was
clearly
not--
--they
were
willing
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
they
would
approve
those
provisions
as
part
of
a
unitary
system
but
might
not
be
willing
to
approve
them
as
part
of
a
divided
system
that
you
want
to
retain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
motor
vehicle
statute
has
a
specific
section
in
it
saying
that
this
doesn't
limit
the
application
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
doesn't
modify
it
in
any
way,
and
doesn't
it
follow
that
if
you
adopt
a
new
form
to
be
used
to
register
voters,
that
that's
a
change
or
practice,
blah,
blah,
blah,
within
the
meaning
of
section
5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
fact
that
the
federal
government,
the
federal
statute
required
them
to
do
some
things,
made
them
print
a
new
form
with
respect
to
elections,
is
it
not
still
true
that
the
distribution
of
a
new
form
to
people
who
are
being
registered,
a
form
you
never
used
before,
is
a
change
in
a
voting
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
so.
