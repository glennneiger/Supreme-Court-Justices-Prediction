eligible...
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--could
you
give
me
a
few
illustrations
of
that?
one
is
which
state
offices
will
be
used
for
registration.
i
take
it
that's
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
federal?
you
mean
only
vote
in
federal
elections.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
that
respect,
may
i
rephrase
justice
o'connor's
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
isn't
your
position
that
as
a
practical
matter...
as
a
practical
matter,
the
state
must
ask
for
preclearance
of
its
former
voting
procedures.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
state
cannot
leave
in
place
its
previous
precleared
procedures
without
further
amendment
and
alteration
of
those
procedures.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
is
a
significant
possibility
that
mississippi
cannot
implement
the
motor
voter...
mrv
statute
without
also
changing
precleared,
preexisting
procedures
for
elections,
for
state
election
registration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it's
a
significant
possibility
based
upon
the
comment
that
you've...
and
the
explanation
you've
just
given
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
be
the
position
of
the
state
of
mississippi
if
you
failed
to
preclear
its
implementation
of
the
new
federal
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
it
go,
could
elections
at
the
state
and
local
level
proceed
but
not
at
the
federal
level?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now--
--and
is
it
further
true
that
you
concede...
i
interpret
your
remarks
this
way.
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
is
it
further
true
that
you
do
concede
that
mississippi's
discretionary
acts
in
implementing
nvra
must
be
precleared?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
that
they--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
they
must
be
precleared,
must
be
subject
to
preclearance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the...
without
reference
to
the
nvra,
the
state
of
mississippi
decided
to
have
a
new
form
advising
voters
of
the
effect
of
their
registration,
where
they
could
register
and
so
forth,
would
that
have
to
be
precleared?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
an
instruction
mailed
to
all
voters
with
respect
to
an
explanation
of
registration
procedures.
you
do
not
have
to
preclear
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
a
new
form,
new
wording,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
not
a
voting
practice
or
procedure.
