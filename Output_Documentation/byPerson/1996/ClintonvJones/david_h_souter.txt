justice
david
h.
souter
but,
in
effect,
i...
i
assume
you're
arguing
that
it
is
interference
or
the
risk
of
interference
with
the
actual
presidential
duties
during
the
4-year
term
that
is
the
source
of
whatever
privilege
you
request;
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
now,
how
does
that
take
you
from
interference
with
the
president
himself,
as...
as
a
deponent
or
as
a
witness
or
simply
as
a
party
attending
a
trial,
and...
and
go
to
the
further
extent
of...
of
giving
you
some
kind
of
a
privilege
to
preclude
discovery,
which
does
not
personally
involve
the
president?
how...
how
is
the
interference
there
enough
for
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
going
to
keep
you
busy.
but
the
president
presumably--
[laughter]
--i
mean,
the
president
isn't
going
to
attend
these
depositions;
you
are.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
reason
for
that
that
the
immunity
in
a
federal
court
would
be
meaningless
if
it
were
subject
to
an
end
run,
and
that's
how
the
supremacy
clause
translates
a
separation
of
powers
doctrine
into
a
state
court
immunity;
isn't
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
the
only
issue
was
good
faith.
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
if
in
fact
the
particular
objection
to
the
particular
deposition
and
what-not
was
made
in
good
faith,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
honor
it,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
let's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
all
of
this
showing,
all
of
this
inquiry
goes
to
the
good
faith
of
the
request.
justice
david
h.
souter
goes
to...
i
thought
you
were
saying
it
goes
to
the
good
faith
of
the
claim
of
interference,
and
that
is
a
different
thing,
i
think,
that
you
are
allowing
thereby
from
an
inquiry
into
the
degree
of
interference
and
whether
the
interference
is
serious
enough
to
warrant
the
stay
or
what-not.
i
think
those
are
two
different
inquiries,
and
i
understood
you
to
be
saying
back
when
you
were
responding
to
justice
breyer
that
it
was
the
good
faith
inquiry
that
would
be
dispositive.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
asked--
--i
thought
you
were
arguing
that...
or
conceding
that
if
there
was
in
fact
a
good
faith
assertion
of
the
privilege
in
a
given
instance,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
honor
it.
is
that...
i
am
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
davis--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
davis,
if
we
can
trust
the
court
to
make
that
judgment,
and
if
we
can
trust
the
court
to
make
all
the
specific
judgments
on
an
instance-by-instance
basis
which
you
think
is
the
appropriate
way,
why
can't
we
also
trust
the
court
to
make
a
judgment
up
front
that
there
are
going
to
be
so
many
specific
instances,
and
the
so
many
specific
instances
are
going
to
be
so
costly
to
the
president
that
the
only
practical
thing
is
to
make
a
blanket
judgment
now
based
upon
its
good
judgment?
if
we
can
trust
the
court
to
make
the
first
two
kinds
of
good
judgments,
why
can't
we
trust
a
court
to
make
that
third
kind?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
all
discretionary.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it's
an
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion
in
each
instance.
if
we
can
trust
them
in
the
first
two
examples,
which
you
concede,
why
not
in
the
third,
assuming
there's
an
evidentiary
basis
for
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
let's
assume
that
the
president's
lawyers
come
in
and
they
provide
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
only
thing--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
only
thing
we're
really
arguing
about,
then,
is
whether
there
ought
to
be
a
blanket
rule
that
can
be
invoked
simply
by
saying,
i
want
this
deferral
for
4
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
distinct
from
a
rule
in
which
the
president's
lawyers
are
going
to
come
in
and
say,
these
are
the
practical
stakes
involved,
and
they
therefore
justify
a
4-year
continuance.
that's
all
we're
really
arguing
about.
