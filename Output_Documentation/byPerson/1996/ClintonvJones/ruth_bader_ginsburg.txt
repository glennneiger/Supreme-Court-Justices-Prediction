mr.
bennett--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bennett,
is
there
any
experience
in
states
with
the
temporal
immunity
with
respect
to
a
governor
that
you
are
asserting
here
with
respect
to
the
chief
officer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
is
it
necessary...
you
said
we
must
decide
this
as
a
constitutional
matter
because
of
the
state
court
situation...
this
could
be
dealt
with
in
the
federal
courts
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law.
isn't
that
where
the
immunities
come
from
of
executive
offices?
and
who
knows
if
it
would
come
up
in
a
state
court.
a
state
court
might
have
such
a
similar...
recognize
such
a
similar
immunity
as
a
matter
of
their
common
law.
so
why
must
we
now
assume
that
the
state
courts
will
not
have
such
a...
such
an
immunity
and
reach
out
for
a
constitutional
question
instead
of
saying
here's
a
suit
in
federal
court
and
we
can
deal
with
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
bennett,
that
sentence
that
you
feature
was
followed
up
by...
by
these
words,
"as
in
the
case
of
prosecutors
and
judges.
"
and
prosecutors
and
judges
also
enjoy
absolute
immunity
for
their
acts
in
the
course
of
their
office.
but
do
they
enjoy
any
kind
of
immunity
for...
for
conduct
unrelated
to
their
office?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
we're
mixing
up
two
things.
we're
mixing
up,
one,
the
total
immunity,
because
you
want
the
decisionmaking
to
be
unfettered,
and
then
the
immunity
that's,
as
you
say,
temporary,
temporal,
just
not
whether
but
when.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
are
different
considerations
involved
in
the
two,
are
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dellinger,
there
was
a
list
in
many
of
the
briefs.
and
it
went:
nuisance
abatement,
mortgage
foreclosure,
divorce,
child
custody.
and
those
were
presented
as
categorical
exceptions.
are
you
saying
that
it
would
be
a
case-by-case
thing
or
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
cases
that
would
be
excluded
from
this
temporal
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dellinger...
general,
but
you're
not
just
talking
about
when
the
president
is
called
to
testify;
you
are
talking
about
all
the
other
people
in
the
litigation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
what
makes
it
unlike
the
legislative
hearing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
same
question.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
law
would
govern
that?
is
it
just
state
law,
be
nice
to
presidents?
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
what
law
would
control,
federal
or
state,
when
a
president
says
i
can't
be
there
because
i
have
to
do
something
that's
connected
with
my
office?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
probably
try
to
take
it
out
of
the
immunity
context
with
respect
to
lesser
officers...
you
know,
the
fitzgerald
case
has
been
featured
in
the
briefs
and
in
this
argument,
but
harlow
came
down
the
same
day,
and
in
that
case
this
court
said
that
discovery
can
be
peculiarly
disruptive
of
effective
government.
that
was
in
the
case
of
a
lesser
officer.
and
so
for
that
reason
the
court
said,
although
immunity
is
only
qualified,
we're
going
to
decide
that
question
at
the
top
of
the
list
before
any
discovery
is
allowed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
davis,
what
is
at
risk
for
you
taking
into
account
two
things.
mr.
bennett
said
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
take
depositions
to
perpetuate
testimony
if
there's
a
danger
that
the
testimony
won't
be
available
later
and,
should
you
prevail,
you
get
interest
on
any
damage
award,
so
what
is
at
stake
in
a
postponement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
hasn't
alleged
anything
like
that,
has
she?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
as
far
as
witnesses'
memories
were
concerned,
i
thought
that
mr.
bennett
had
conceded
that
you
could
have
something
like
rule
27
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
depositions
to
perpetuate
testimony?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
no,
responding
to
the
dim
memory
problem,
that
dim
memory
is
a
problem.
then
you
can
get
the
current
memory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that,
because
even
in
the
fitzgerald
case
justice
powell
had
a
footnote
where
he
suggested
that
congress
might
pass
a
law
authorizing
such
a
claim
against
the
president.
now,
if
congress
could
pass
a
law,
then
it
can't
be
a
constitutional
matter,
can
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no.
in
the
fitzgerald
case
justice
powell
said
that
he
was
leaving
over
the...
leaving
open
the
possibility
that
congress
could
do
away
with
the
absolute
immunity--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--by
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
by
a
mere
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
would
if
there's
a
federal...
if
the
immunity's
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
and
not
federal
constitutional
law.
