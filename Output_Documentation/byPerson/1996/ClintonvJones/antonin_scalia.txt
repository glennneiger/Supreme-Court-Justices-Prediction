justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
you
wouldn't
go
up
and
what
if
the
district
court...
what
if
the
court
below
disagreed
with
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
rule
of
law
you're
urging
upon
us
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
issue
a
federal...
is
it
a
federal...
suppose
the
suit
were
in
state
court,
and
the
state
court
decided
that
the
testimony
of
someone
who
was
not
the
president
is
important
to
be
preserved.
does
that
become
a
federal
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
that
state
court's
jurisdiction
would
be
appealable
here,
or
would
the
whole
case
be
removable
to
federal
court,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
constitutional
ruling
you're
asking
of
us
is
not
that
the
suit
cannot
be
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
that
the
suit
can
be
brought.
and
presumably
it
can
be
brought
in
state
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
these...
these
questions
of
whether
you
have
to
preserve
the
witnesses'
testimony...
it's
important
to
the
case
or
not...
do
they
render
the
case
removable
to
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
find
it
difficult
to
adopt
such
a
federal
common
law
rule
if
it
were...
if
it
were
so
easily
frustratable.
i
mean
to
say
that
there
is
a
federal
common
law
rule
that
you
can
interfere
with
the
president's
duties
by...
by
subjecting
him
to
civil
suit
would
be
silly
if
any
state
could
subject
him
to
silly...
to
civil
suit.
i
mean,
don't
you
have
to...
have
to
tell
me
that
this
federal
common
law
rule
you're
asking
me
to
adopt
is
one
that
will
have
some
effect?
and
it
will
have
no
effect
if
the
states
can
do
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
have
to
get
to
state
courts
somehow.
any
general
rule
we
adopt
surely
has
to
be
one
that
we
can
enforce
upon
state
courts
as
well
as
federal.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
worse,
any
federal
court.
because
there
you
have,
in
addition,
separation
of
powers.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
we
wait
until
the
president
asserts
such
a
conflict?
it's
never
happened
in
a
couple
of
hundred
years.
why
can't
we
wait
until
the
court
says,
mr.
president,
i
want
you
here
for
this
deposition
and,
if
you
don't
come,
you're
going
to
lose
the
case;
and
the
president
says,
i'm
sorry,
i
have
to
go
to
a
nato
meeting?
why
don't
we
wait
for
that,
what
seems
to
me,
very
unlikely
situation
to
arise?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
not
if
it's
based
on
the
separation
of
powers.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me...
i
don't
understand
how
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
requires
you
to
say
that
it
is
separation
of
powers
that
somehow
gets
to
the
state
courts.
a
state...
you
could
not
bring
suit
in
the
state
court
to
stay
a
federal
actor,
whether
it's
the
president
or
not.
it's
simply
the
supremacy
clause
that
says
state
courts
don't
muck
around
with...
with
federal
activities.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
separation
of
powers
to
get
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
keeps
the
state
courts
out.
and
then
you
have
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers,
which
keeps
the
federal
courts
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
that's
quite
different
from
saying
we've
extended...
somehow
we
make
a
ruling
on
separation
of
powers
for
the
federal
courts
and
that
automatically
slops
over
to
the
state
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dellinger,
can
i
ask
you
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
both
make
a
lot
about
the
fact
that
the
president
is...
you
know,
it's
a
full-time
job
and
he...
he's
very...
and
any
intrusion
upon
his
time
is
intruding.
i
must
say,
i
don't
find
that
terribly
persuasive.
the
fact
is
that...
that
that's
a
better
reason
why
the
chief
justice
or
any
of
the
justices
of
this
court
should
have
the
kind
of
immunity
you're
talking
about,
or
the
speaker
of
the
house,
or
a
member
of
congress,
none
of
whom
can
delegate
any
of
their
responsibilities.
the
president
is
the
one
federal
officer
at
the
highest
level
who
is
able
to
delegate.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
see
presidents
riding
horseback,
chopping
firewood,
fishing
for
stick
fish--
[laughter]
--playing
golf
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
why
can't
we
leave
it
to
the
point
where,
if
and
when
a
court
tells
a
president
to
be
there
or
he's
going
to
lose
his
case,
and
if
and
when
a
president
has
the
intestinal
fortitude
to
say,
i
am
absolutely
too
busy...
so
that
he'll
never
be
seen
playing
golf
for
the
rest
of
his
administration--
--if
and
when
that
happens,
we
can...
we
can
resolve
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
really,
the
notion
that
he
doesn't
have
a
minute
to
spare
is...
is
just
not...
not
credible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
once
you
assume
that,
arguendo,
you
don't
have
a
firm
rule,
and
you
begin
to
lose
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
don't
like
cases...
i
do
not
like
courts
engaging
in
case-by-case
balancing
and
saying,
this
intrudes
on
the
presidency
too
much,
this
doesn't
intrude.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
give
me
a
clear
line,
and
i
might
buy
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
let's
say
it
is
singular.
now,
it
seems
to
me
you're
talking
about
intrusion
of
the
judiciary
upon
the
executive's
time.
you
also
have,
sometimes,
intrusion
by
the
legislature
upon
the
executive's
time.
now,
the
way
we've
chosen
to
handle
that
with
respect
in
particular
to
claims
of
president
al
privilege...
not
to
testify,
not
turn
over
documents,
not
to
give
information
to
congress...
is
we
haven't
adopted
an
absolute
rule
that,
because
it
would
be
so
intrusive
upon
the
president,
you
can't
make
any
such
demands.
we
wait
for
the
case
to
arise.
and
if
and
when
the
president
has
the
intestinal
fortitude
to
say,
as,
for
instance,
dwight
eisenhower
did
with
respect
to
the
army
mccarthy
hearings,
i
am
not
going
to
give
any
testimony;
i
am
not
going
to
allow
any
of
my
people
to
give
testimony.
if
and
when
that
comes
up,
i'm
willing
to
allow
a
total
executive
privilege
at
that
point.
why
can't
we
adopt
the
same
rule
here?
if
and
when
the
president
says,
i
just
don't
have
the
time
to
come
when
you
subpoena
me,
i'll
give
him
an
absolute
immunity
in
that
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
enough
to
protect
the
president
from
all
that
we're
worried
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
beautiful
thing
about
it
is
it
takes
the
courts
out
of
the
scene.
they
don't
have
to
decide,
is
it
too
important,
is
it
unimportant,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
which
gets
the
courts
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
way
it's
absolute.
all
the
president
has
to
do
is
stand
up
and
say,
i'm
too
busy
to
come
to
this
hearing,
and
i
will
not
come,
and
you
have
no
power
to
enter
judgment
against
me
simply
because
of
my
refusal.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
davis--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
do
when
a
state
court
tells
the
president,
you're
going
to
lose
this
lawsuit
unless
you
appear
for
a
hearing
on
june
2,
and
the
president
says,
you
know,
your
honor,
i
have
a
nato
meeting
i'm
supposed
to
go
to,
heads
of
state,
and
you
know,
you
have
a
testy
district
judge
or
local
state
court
judge...
you've
encountered
some
of
them...
and
they
say,
this
is
my
courtroom
and,
you
know,
i
expect
you
here
on
june
2.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
there's
no
remedy
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
who
judges
that,
the
judge
does?
the
judge
says,
well,
mr.
president,
this
nato
meeting,
i've
sort
of
looked
up
the...
it's
not
a
very
important
nato
meeting.
[laughter]
you
could
send
your
secretary
of
state.
in
fact,
i
think
he's
smarter
than
you
are
anyway.
or
the
president
says,
it's
top
secret.
i
can't
tell
you,
judge,
why
i
can't
be
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
who
decides
that?
what
we're
asking
is,
who
decides?
does
this
court
decide
whether
the
president
is
being
interfered
with
too
much,
or
is
the
simple
assertion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
simple
assertion
by
the
president,
if
he's
willing
to
take
the
political
heat
and
say,
i
don't
have
enough
time
to
come
to
this
hearing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
you
allow
that
absolutely
to
control?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
you
leave
political
pressures
to
take
care
of
that?
no
president's
going
to
do
it
10
times.
he's
going
to
look
very
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
this
is
third
party
depositions
we
were
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
davis--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
davis,
i
am
unlikely
to
favor
a
disposition
that
allows
any
judge,
federal
or
state,
to
sit
in
judgment
of
the
president's
assertion
of
whether
his
executive
duties
are
too
important
or
not.
what
about
an
alternative
to
your
proposal
that
would
draw
a
distinction
between
the
person
of
the
president
being
hauled
before
a
court
and
depositions
of
other
people,
and
say
the
latter,
and
the
worry
about
the
trial,
and
all
of
that,
is
just
like
worry
about
his
personal
health
or
his
financial
affairs,
or
marital
problems
at
home,
or
whatever.
it's
just
something
you've
got
to
live
with,
even
when
you're
president.
however,
to
be
hauled
personally
before
a
judge
is
something
else,
and
so
give
the
president
absolute
immunity.
if
he
makes
the
claim,
i'm
too
busy
to
come,
you
cannot
enter
judgment
against
him
simply
because
he
refuses
to
appear,
but
the
rest
of
the
trial
can
proceed.
would
that
be
acceptable
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
the
president
says
so?
i'm
not
saying
the
rest
of
the
trial.
i'm
just
saying,
when
he's
subpoenaed
to
testify
he
says,
i
am
too
busy.
i
am
president
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
has
to
make
that
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
still
insist
that
the
court
pass
judgment
on...
if
the
president
can't
come
to
some
compromise,
you
think
the
court
will
sit
in
judgment
on
whether,
indeed,
he's
too
busy?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
suffer
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
suffer
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
of
course
congress
can
apparently
make
constitutional
by
statute
what
is
otherwise
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause,
can't
it?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
if
that
were
true,
it
wouldn't
be
unheard
of
in
our
strange
jurisprudence.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it's
true.
[laughter]
the
fact
is
true
though.
is
it
not
true
that
congress
by
statute
can--
--well,
congress
gives
power--
--cause
something
which
otherwise
would
be
held
by
this
court
to
violate
the
commerce
clause
not
to
violate
it.
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
it
doesn't
give
congress
the
power
to
regulate
immunities.
i
suppose
there's
a
distinction.
