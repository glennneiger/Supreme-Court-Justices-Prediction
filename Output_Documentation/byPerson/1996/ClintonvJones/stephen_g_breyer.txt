well,
what
is
it
in
the
constitution
that
makes
the
immunity,
let's
say,
of
a
federal
judge
or
the
immunity
of
any
federal
employee
for
acts
of
official
duty
binding
in
a
state
court,
where
that
activity
might
itself
constitute
a
tort
under
state
law?
what
is
it
in
the
constitution
that
binds
the
state
courts
so
that
the
state
court
can't
proceed?
is
this
the
supremacy
clause?
i
mean,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
there
is
a
separation
of
powers
doctrine
that
creates
a...
a...
call
it
a
federal
common
law-type
immunity,
then
that
immunity
for
judges
or
anyone
else
is
binding
upon
the
state
courts
because
of
the
supremacy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
those
demands
in
respect
to
a
deposition,
say,
kept
under
seal,
of
non-white
house
witnesses?
how
does
proceeding
with
discovery
for
non-white
house
witnesses...
even,
let's
say,
kept
it
under
seal
so
it
wasn't
in
the
press,
et
cetera...
how
would
that
interfere
with
the
daily
workings
of
the
presidency?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
in
your
view
is
an
interference?
that
is,
suppose,
for
example,
that
the
lawyers
are
deposing
non-white
house
witnesses
and
it
turns
out
that
every
statement
they
made
is
in
the
newspaper
and
the
president
says,
but
i
have
to
respond
to
each
of
these.
they're
saying
i
was
in
a
certain
place
at
a
certain
time,
or
i
said
something
to
somebody
only
a
month
ago.
and
then
somebody
else
says
something
about
what
he
didn't
say,
and
then
somebody
says
something
about
where
there's
a
paper
that
somebody
wrote
it
down,
and
then
it
goes
into...
we
all
know
how
those
things
work,
and
suppose
the
president
says,
look,
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
all
of
these
things.
i
don't
have
time
to
remember
every
single
thing
i
said
to
everybody
and
anything
that's
tangentially
related.
it's
interfering,
right
now.
now,
what
in
your
view...
is
that
an
interference,
or
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i've
just
given
you
the
example.
is
that
an
interference,
or
he's
saying
this
deposition,
all
these
depositions
interfere
because
i
don't
have
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
an
interference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
he
comes
and
says
that,
and
how
in
your
view
should
this
be
decided?
i'm
just
repeating
now
the
question,
that
i
want
to
be
clear
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
how...
when
the...
when
your
side,
for
example,
takes
dozens
of
depositions,
and
each
one
turns
up
what
i
call
peripheral
or
satellite
issues
about
who
said
what
to
whom
where,
and
where
the
paper
is
and
where
it
isn't
and
so
forth,
and
he
says,
i
don't
have
time
to
talk
to
my
lawyers
about
all
of
these
details
because
there
are
so
many,
and
they
require
so
much
thought,
and
that's
his
claim
of
interference.
now,
how
in
your
view
is
it
supposed
to
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
only
fact
is--
