mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
responding
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
source
of
law.
it
is
constitutionally
based.
in
our
view,
justice
scalia,
it
comes
from
this
court's...
the
same
basis
that
this
court
stated
in
its
different
opinion
in
fitzgerald,
where
they
considered
the
immunity
there,
quote,
a
functionally
mandated
incident
of
the
president's
unique
office.
that
is,
it
arises
from
article
ii.
that's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
you
are
correct,
justice
o'connor,
that
it
is
a
different
issue
in
fitzgerald.
but
what
fitzgerald
stands
for
is
the
proposition
that
this
court
can
announce
rules
of
law
which
are
binding
on
state
and
federal
courts,
as
the
fitzgerald
immunity
surely
is
binding
in
state
and
federal
courts.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
the...
to
the
extent
that
it's
based
upon
federal
law,
it
is
the
supremacy
clause.
to
the
extent
that
it's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
absolutely
court,
justice
scalia,
in--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
believe
that
the
fitzgerald
immunity
clearly
applies
to
actions
brought
in
state
court.
surely
the
court
in
fitzgerald
did
not
announce
that
a
doctrine
of
immunity
for
presidential
actions,
in
the
official
capacity--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
some
of
that
comes
by--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
justice--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
you
need...
what
you
need
is
article
ii,
as
informed
by
the
separation
of
powers.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
nixon
v.--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
the...
in
both
instances,
however,
the
public
interest
in
the
president's
unimpaired
performance
of
his
duties
must
take
precedence
over
a
private
litigant's
interest
in
redress.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
scalia,
the
singularity
and
unitariness
of
the
executive
are
what
makes
it
distinguishable
from
every
other
official,
and
it's
not
possible--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
scalia--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
scalia,
president
reagan
said
quite
aptly,
presidents
don't
have
vacations;
they
have
a
change
of
scenery.
every
party
to
this
litigation
and
every
judge
below
agrees
that
a
president
cannot
be
subjected
to
litigation
in
the
same
manner
as
someone
who
is
not
at
that
time
serving
as
president.
what...
what
is
at
issue
is
not
whether
an
action
against
the
president
has
to
be
treated
differently,
but
how
that
difference
should
be.
and
the
approach
suggested
by
the
court
below
of...
of
sensitive
judicial
case
management
would
wholly
fail
both
to
protect
the
president
and
would
enmesh
the
state
and
federal
courts
in
a
politically
charged
task,
lacking
manageable
judicial
standards.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
i
think
that
certainly
political
pressures
would
cut
against
that.
but
we
have...
we
have
acknowledged
that
delay
could
well
have
adverse
consequences
for
a
plaintiff
suing
any
president.
but
that
has
never
been
treated
dispositive.
there
is
nothing
anomalous
about
the
proposition
that
individual
civil
damage
remedies
are
precluded
by
public
policy
considerations.
chief
justice
burger
noted
in
fitzgerald
that
there
are
at
least
75,000
public
officials
that
have
absolute
immunity,
a
different
kind
of
immunity,
but
one
which
nonetheless
precludes
plaintiffs
from
being
able
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be...
that's
the
most
appealing
case
for
an
exception
i've
heard.
now,
we're
not
suggesting...
and
i
have
to
be
concerned
about--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
am
not
suggesting
that
there's
a
balancing
test
or
a
case-by-case
determination.
we're
suggesting
that
there
ought
to
be
a
rule...
and
we
have
to
be
concerned
not
just
with
civil
damage
actions
like
this
one,
but
with
actions
against
all
future
presidents...
a
rule...
an
operative
rule
that
courts
should
postpone
civil
litigation
until
the
president's
term.
but
the
existence
of
that
does
not
mean
we
can
assume,
arguendo,
that
an
extraordinary
case
like
child
custody
you
could
make
an
exception.
now,
as
to
the
president's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--this
is
not
a
matter--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
fact
that
you
have
a
rule,
and
an
operative
rule,
and
it
tells
courts
what
to
do
does
not
mean
that
you
can
never
make
an
exception.
that's
true
of
prior
restraints.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that's
true
of
prior
restraints.
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--we
believe
that
there
should
be
a
rule
that
any
civil
litigation
against
a
president
should
be
postponed.
now,
the
president's
attorney
need
worry
only
about
civil
damage
actions.
and
it
is
hard,
i
think,
given
the
way
our
legal
culture
treats
civil
damage
actions,
to
make
the
case
for
an
exception
in
that
instance.
but
when
you
consider
the
demands
on
the
presidency,
we
think,
given
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
it
could
interfere
with
the
workings
of
the
presidency,
and
therefore
would
urge
that
discovery
be
postponed,
except
for
lost
evidence
that
mr.
bennett
has
acknowledged
that
he
would
accommodate.
because
i
think
litigation
can
be
all-consuming
and
all-absorbing.
i
think
there
is...
one
has
to
have
a
sense
of
the
extent
to
which
someone
who
is
involved
in
personal
litigation
can
be
totally
absorbed
by
it.
advising
on
what
questions
should
be
asked
of
witnesses--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--mr.
chief
justice,
the...
when
this
country
adopted
the
25th
amendment,
it
was
a
recognition
by
congress
and
the
courts
that
the
president's
office
was
singular,
as
chairman
emmanuel
cellars
said
when
he
proposed
the
amendment
to
congress,
the
nation
cannot
permit
the
office
of
the
president
to
be
vacant
even
for
a
moment.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
scalia--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because
i
think
that
risks
both,
failing
to
protect
the
president
and
risks
undercutting
the
role
of
the
courts.
to
put
the
president
to
the
task
with
regard
to
each
phase
of
a
lawsuit--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
totally
undercuts--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
scalia,
that
would...
the
approach
that
would
have
litigation
go
on...
and
perhaps
no
president
could
responsibly
agree
to
attend,
which
is
why
putting
the
president
to
a
task
at
every
step
and
putting
the
courts
at
that
task
of
making
a
decision
about
which
of
the
president's
duties.
the
president's
work
makes
it
impossible--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--you
would
put
the
president
to
the
burden
of
being
concerned
with
litigation
constantly
and
having
to
raise
at
each
point
a
refusal
to
participate
or
to
cut
off
his
testimony.
you
would
put...
you
would
put
a--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the...
the
absorption
of
the
president
with
the
rest
of
the
trial
and
the
hearing
places
the
article
iii
judiciary
in
a
very
difficult
position.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
give
a
list
of
activities...
i'm
sorry,
the
respondents...
in
their
brief
that
they
think
would
not
have
justified
delay,
including
vacation
activities
where
important
work
may
have
been
done,
including
a
good
example
of
what
would
happen
to
the
courts
is
a
4-day
train
trip
they
note
that
a
president...
this
particular
president
took
en
route
to
a
political
convention.
now,
if
you
debate
that
example,
half
the
people
will
say
that's
clearly
nonofficial
and
shouldn't
give
way.
they're
absolutely
right;
it's
not
even
paid
for
by
the
government.
others
will
say
it's
an
important
governmental
function
for
a
president
to
communicate
during
his
reelection
campaign.
