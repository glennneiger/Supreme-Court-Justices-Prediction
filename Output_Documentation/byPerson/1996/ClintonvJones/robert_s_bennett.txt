mr.
robert
s.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
here
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
of
the
president
of
the
united
states,
who
has
asked
this
court
to
defer
a
private
civil
damage
suit
for
money
damages
against
him
until
he
leaves
office.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
it
is
to
delay
the
trial
of
the
case
and
to--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--and
the
discovery
of
the
case.
there
is--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we...
as--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--i
want
to
delay
that
as
well.
however--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--as
we
discussed
in
the
district
court
below,
justice
o'connor,
we
have
agreed,
and
the
district
court
noted,
that
if
there's
a
danger
of
the
loss
of
any
evidence,
that
we
would
cooperate
to
preserve
it
and
make
use
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
well,
that's--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--the
rule
of
law
that
we
are
urging
upon
you,
justice
scalia,
is
unless
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
in
a
case,
the
president
of
the
united
states
should
not
be
subject
to
litigation,
either
at
trial
or
in
discovery.
unless
there
is
some
compelling
necessity,
he
should
not
be
taken
away
from
his
constitutional
duties.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
yes,
it's
a
federal
question,
because--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--well,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
move
a
case
from
state
court
unless
there
is
diversity.
and
that's
why
this
court
must
issue
a
constitutional
ruling
in
this
case.
because,
otherwise,
this...
this
complaint,
and
other
complaints,
could
be
brought
into
any
state
court
in
the
country
and
command
the
president's
time.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
well,
we're
asking--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--we
are
saying
the
suit
against
the
president
of
the
united
states
can
be
brought.
it
can
be
brought
in
a
state
court.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
it
can
be
brought
in
a
federal
court.
but--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
they
do.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
particularly
in
this
case,
where
the
plaintiff
had
almost
20
months
when
mr.
clinton
was...
was
the
governor.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
i
don't
agree
with
that,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
a
separation
of
powers
case.
because
if
this...
if
this
court
permits
this
litigation
or
other
litigation
like
it
to
go
forward,
any
state
judge
in
the
country
or
any
county
court
judge
in
the
country
could
command
the
president's
time.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
well,
but
i...
i
would
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
court
would
say
that
separation
of
powers
would
apply
in
a
federal
court
proceeding,
but
that
any
county
or
state
judge
could
virtually
destroy
the
power
of
the
president
under
the
constitution
in
his
article
ii
duties.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
i...
i
understand.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
i...
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--we
have
found
none,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor,
but
i
think
i
do.
i
am
certainly
saying
that
this
court
could
decide
this
case
without
deciding
the
constitutional
issue.
i
think
that
this
court
could
say
that
when
the
district
court
judge
stayed
the
trial,
she
had
an
inherent
power,
under
the
landis
case...
the
supreme...
this
court's
decision
in
landis...
to
stay
the
trial.
and
i
don't
think
you
would
have
to
get
to
the
constitutional
considerations.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
yes,
i
agree
it
would
be
very
silly
for
any
county
judge
or
any
state
judge
to
start
deciding
on
the
priorities
of
the
president
of...
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
oh,
that's
of
most
importance
to
this
court,
particularly
since
the
fact
that
you
now
have
long-arm
statutes
which
were
not
common
in
the
days
of
our
founders,
and
you
could
drag
the
president
into
any
court.
you
know,
what's
unprecedented
here...
what
is
unprecedented
here
is
the
notion
of
taking
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america,
in
whom
the
full
executive
power
resides,
and
subjecting
that
president
to
any
state
court
or
any
local
court
in
the
country.
is
this
court--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--or
any...
or
in
any
federal
court.
and
i
think,
interestingly,
your
honors,
if
you...
if
you
just
transpose
the
facts
of
this
case
to
the
federal
system...
let's
say
that
miss
jones
were
a
federal
employee
and
let's
say
that
mr.
clinton
were
the
president,
and
let's
say
that
instead
of
state
troopers,
we're
talking
about
secret
service
people...
it
would
be
my
view
that
your
very
far-reaching
decision
in
the
fitzgerald
case,
which...
which
gave
the
president
absolute
immunity
for...
for
acts
within
the
outer
perimeters,
would
probably...
would
probably
prevent
this
case
from...
from
going
forward.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
that...
that
element
is
not
present
here.
but
in
the
fitzgerald
opinion,
in
which
you
joined
with
justice
powell,
the
rationale
for
that
decision
goes
way
beyond
the
chilling
effect.
you
talked
about
intrusion
on
the
president's
time.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
no.
no,
justice
ginsburg.
but...
but
you
went
much
further.
i
don't
mean
you
personally.
but
you
went
much
further
in
the
fitzgerald
case.
this
was
the
core
of
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
white.
he
said
that
you
are
not
giving
absolute
immunity
simply
to
core
functions.
you
are
giving
absolute
immunity
to
the
outer
perimeters
of
the
office.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
right.
we're
not
asking
for--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
that...
that
is
correct.
but
you
must
remember,
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
fitzgerald
case...
or
one
of
the
fundamental
differences
is
this
court
extinguished
mr.
fitzgerald's
rights
for
all
time,
involving
a
case
where
you
didn't
even
have
a
sitting
president.
mr.
nixon
hadn't
been
in
office,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
for
4
years.
here
you
have
a
sitting
president.
and
all
we're
saying
is
we'll
give
miss
jones
her
day
in
court,
but
let's
not
do
it
now.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
well,
mr.
justice
souter,
it's
the
realities
of
real-world
litigation.
mr....
my
brother
at
the
bar,
mr.
davis--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--but
in
the
real
world
of
litigation,
mr.
justice
souter,
do
you
think
when
mr.
davis,
as
he...
as
he
claims,
that
he's
going
to
be
deposing
all
of
the
troopers;
and
any
time
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
come
into
contact
with
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex,
he
intends
to
inquire
of
that;
this
is
a
conspiracy
complaint;
they
talk
about
pattern
of
conduct--
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
--don't
you
think
i'm
going
to
have
to
talk
to
the
president
of
united
states
about
all
those
events?
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
i
think
some
trial
courts
would
say
they
are
not
and
some
trial
courts
might...
might
say
they
are.
we
haven't
gotten
to
that
question
yet.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
it's
impossible
to
say.
i
can
tell
you
the
president
has
spent...
personally
spent
a
substantial
amount
of
time
on
this
case
already.
i
mean,
this
is
a
personal...
the
very
nature
of
this
case
is
so
personal
that
it
would
require
his
heavy
involvement.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
i...
i
think
the
president
is
a
political
figure
and...
and
deals
in
the
political...
political
marketplace.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
can...
i
think...
there's
no
perfect
answer
to
this.
but
i
certainly
don't
think
that
you
can
permit
the
courts
to
start
deciding
what
presidential
priorities
are
or
are
not.
mr.
robert
s.
bennett
well,
i'm
not
so
sure,
in
today's
climate,
that
it
is
unlikely
to
arise.
but
i
suppose
you
could
wait,
as
you
say.
but
i
have
a
specific
case
i
have
to
deal
with
now.
