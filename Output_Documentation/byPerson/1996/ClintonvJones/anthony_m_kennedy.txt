justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
take
it
that...
i
take
it
that
since
you
say...
and
i
think
you're
correct
that
this
must
be
a
privilege
that's
applicable
in
state
courts,
otherwise
it
would
be
a
loser
and
it
wouldn't
give
the
protection
you
think
the
president
needs...
i
take
it
that
means
you
cannot
rely
on
separation
of
powers
as
the
constitutional
theory,
as
the
constitutional
premise,
for
your
argument;
you
have
to
rely
on
some
other
constitutional
doctrine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
but
separation
of
powers
isn't
a
doctrine
that
we
impose
on
the
state.
separation
of
powers
is
designed
to
confine
each
branch
of
the
federal
government
to
its
appropriate
constitutional
scope.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
understand
there's
a
federal
interest.
but
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
inherent
nature
of
the
president's
office
requires
that
the
states
be
constrained
in
this
way.
but
that's
not
separation
of
powers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
other
hand,
the
case
such
as
toddles
case,
which
says
that
a
state...
or
a
state
court...
cannot
enjoin
a
federal
official,
have
to
do
with
a
federal
official
in
the
course
of
his
duties.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
you
can
help
me
with
this
aspect
of
that
argument.
and
it's
been
troubling
to
me.
when
we
talk
about
privileges
and
immunities,
we're
talking
about
balances
of
interests,
the
rights
of
the
litigant,
the
necessities
of
the
president.
here,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
president,
during
the
course
of
the
stay
that
this
proceeding
produces,
is
free
with
his
staff
and
his
resources
to
really,
to
continue
to
argue
his
case,
to
ruin
the
reputation
of
the
plaintiff,
to
poison
the
well
any
way
he
can,
just
as
the...
as
the
other
parties
might
try
to
do
against
him.
but
he's
in
a
very
dominant
position.
there's
really
nothing
we
have
that
could
stay
the
president's
activity
in
this
regard.
that
certainly
is
beyond
the
control
of
the
court.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
imbalance
here
is
very
substantial.
and
i
know
of
no
compensating
balance
mechanism
to
protect
the
plaintiff.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
don't
we
know
that
that's
inevitable
in
a
suit
like
this?
this
argument
here
today
is
taking
an
hour.
all
the
counsel
and
all
participants
in
the
argument
have
thought
about
it
for
at
least
the
weekend
if
not
a
week.
[laughter]
there's
an
anxiety
component,
there's
an
intellectual
commitment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there's
an
emotional
commitment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
far
more
extensive
than
some
time
chart
would
indicate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
that's
part
of
what
the
president
is
saying,
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
he's
going
to
defend
this
lawsuit
it
will
absorb
substantial
energies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you
say
that
the
president
can
in
good
faith
make
an
assertion
of
privilege
that
would
be
honored
if
it's
in
good
faith,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
give
away
most
of
your
case.
you
leave
two
things
for
court
inquiry,
number
1,
the
existence
of
good
faith,
and
number
2
whether
or
not
it's
a
risk
to
the
presidency.
it
seems
to
me
that
both
of
those
inquiries
are
so
very,
very
intrusive
that
it
argues
strongly
for
the
absolute
privilege
that
petitioners
are
suggesting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose,
because
there
are
other
parties
involved,
that
it
were
10
days
of
trial,
2
working
weeks,
and...
pick
a
number...
15
depositions.
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
substantial
investment
of
the
president's
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
it
then
were
in
that
degree,
you
think
that
he'd
be
entitled
to
an
order
deferring
the
litigation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
something
of
a
perverse
incentive,
then,
because
then
he
has
the
incentive
to
ask
for
a
long
trial.
