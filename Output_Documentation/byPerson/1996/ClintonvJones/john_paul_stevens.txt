yes,

mr.

justice
john
paul

--well,
i
assume--
--mr.
bennett,
do
you
think
all
those
events
are
relevant
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
do
you
think...
how
long...
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
take
to
try
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
in
that
regard
about
third
party
depositions,
and
we're
concerned
about
their
impact
on
the
office
of
the
president
and
so
forth.
would
it
be
permissible
for
the
trial
judge
in
trying
to
control
the
litigation
and
recognize
the
special
problems
of
the
president
to
narrow
discovery
to
matters
that
relate
to
the
particular
incident
involved
in
the
trial
and
say,
no,
you
can't
ask
about
the
history
for
the
last
10
years,
or
45
other
police
officers
and
so
forth.
would
that
be
a
permissible
use
of
the
trial
judge's
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
would
be
permissible
to
him
to
narrow
discovery
and
the
scope
of
inquiry--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
often
true,
and
litigants
always
don't
trust
one
another
completely.
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
take
to
try
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
asking
you
to
describe
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you
to
tell
me
how
long
you
think
it
will
take
to
try
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
take
4
or
5
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
major
concerns,
of
course,
is
the
extent
to
which
you
plan
to
go
into
collateral
matters.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
it
raises
a
constitutional
and
a
prudential
question
considering
the
office
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
respondent,
a
private
citizen,
seeks
to
recover
damages
from
the
current
occupant
of
that
office
based
on
actions
allegedly
taken
before
his
term
began.
the
president
submits
that
in
all
but
the
most
exceptional
cases,
the
constitution
requires
federal
court
to
defer
such
litigation
until
his
term
end
and
that
in
any
event,
respect
for
the
office
warrants
such
a
stay.
the
petitioner,
william
jefferson
clinton
was
elected
to
the
presidency
in
1992
and
re-elected
in
1996.
respondent,
paula
corbin
jones,
is
a
resident
of
california.
on
may
6,
1994,
invoking
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
she
commenced
this
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
arkansas.
in
essence,
her
complaint
alleges
that
on
the
afternoon
of
may
8,
1991,
when
she
was
employed
by
the
arkansas
industrial
commission,
the
petitioner
who
was
then
governor
of
the
state
of
arkansas
engage
in
tortious
conduct
for
which
he
seeks
to
recover
money
damages.
in
response
to
the
complaint,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
seeking
to
postpone
the
proceeding
until
he
is
no
longer
president.
the
district
judge
ordered
a
postponement
of
the
trial
that
allowed
discovery
to
go
forward.
both
parties
appealed.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
order
postponing
the
trial
until
the
president
relieves
office.
we
granted
the
president’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
opinion
first
discusses
cases
and
materials
from
the
historical
record
that
support
the
recognition
of
an
immunity
from
damages
liability,
for
actions
taken
by
the
president
in
his
official
capacity.
we
conclude
that
those
precedents
do
not
apply
to
private
conduct
that
occurred
before
becoming
president.
we
then
turned
to
the
president’s
strongest
argument,
a
claim
that
is
grounded
in
the
character
of
the
office
that
was
created
by
article
ii
of
the
constitution
and
relies
on
separation
of
powers,
principles,
that
has
structured
our
constitutional
arrangements
since
the
founding.
as
a
starting
premise,
petitioner
contends
that
he
occupies
a
unique
office
with
powers
and
responsibilities,
so
vast
and
important
that
the
public
interest
demands
that
he
devote
his
undivided
time
and
attention
to
his
public
duties.
he
submits
that
given
the
nature
of
the
office.
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
places
limits
on
the
authority
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
interfere
with
the
executive
branch
that
would
be
transgressed
by
allowing
this
action
to
proceed.
we
have
no
dispute
with
the
initial
premise
of
the
argument.
former
presidents
from
george
washington
to
george
bush
have
consistently
endorsed
the
dismiss
characterization
of
the
office.
it
does
not
follow,
however
that
separation
of
powers,
principles
would
be
violated
by
allowing
this
action
to
proceed.
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
is
concerned
with
the
allocation
of
official
power
among
the
three
coequal
branches
of
our
government.
in
this
case,
however,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
federal
judiciary
is
being
asked
to
perform
any
function
that
might
in
some
way
be
described
as
executive.
respondent
is
merely
asking
the
courts
to
exercise
their
core
article
iii
jurisdiction
to
decide
cases
and
controversies.
the
litigation
of
question
that
relate
entirely
to
the
unofficial
conduct
of
the
individual
who
happens
to
be
the
president
poses
no
perceptible
risk
or
misallocation
of
either
judicial
power
or
executive
power.
nevertheless,
petitioner
contends
that
as
a
by-product
of
an
otherwise
traditional
exercise
of
judicial
power,
burdens
will
be
placed
on
the
president
that
will
hamper
the
performance
of
his
official
duty.
his
concern
is
that
this
particular
case
as
well
as
the
potential
additional
litigation
that
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
may
spawn,
may
impose
an
unacceptable
burden
on
the
president’s
time
and
energy
and
thereby
impair
the
effective
performance
of
the
office.
petitioner’s
predictive
judgment
signed
a
little
support
in
either
history
or
the
relatively
narrow
compass
of
the
issues
raised
in
this
particular
case.
in
the
entire
history
of
the
republic,
only
three
sitting
presidents
have
been
subjected
to
suits
for
their
private
action.
as
for
the
case
at
hand,
if
properly
managed
by
the
district
court,
it
appears
to
us
highly
unlikely
to
occupy
any
substantial
amount
of
petitioner’s
time.
of
greater
significance,
petitioner
urged
by
presuming
that
interactions
between
the
judicial
branch
and
the
executive,
even
quite
burdensome
interactions,
necessarily
rise
to
the
level
of
constitutionally
forbidden
impairment
of
the
executive’s
ability
to
perform
his
constitutionally
mandated
function.
the
fact
that
a
federal
court’s
exercise
of
its
traditional
article
iii
jurisdiction
may
significantly
burden
the
time
and
attention
of
the
chief
executive
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
two
long
settled
propositions
first
announced
by
chief
justice
marshall
support
that
conclusion.
first,
we
have
long
held
that
when
the
president
takes
official
action,
the
court
has
the
authority
to
determine
whether
he
has
acted
within
the
law.
perhaps
the
most
dramatic
example
of
such
a
case
is
our
holding
that
president
truman
exceeded
his
constitutional
authority
when
he
issued
an
order
directing
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
take
possession
of
the
nation’s
steel
mills
to
avert
the
national
catastrophe.
second,
it
is
also
settled
that
the
president
is
subject
to
judicial
process
in
appropriate
circumstances.
if
the
judiciary
may
severely
burden
the
executive
branch
by
reviewing
the
legality
of
the
president’s
official
conduct,
and
if
it
may
direct
appropriate
process
to
the
president
himself,
it
must
follow
that
the
federal
courts
have
power
to
determine
the
legality
of
his
unofficial
conduct.
the
burden
on
the
president’s
time
and
energy
is
a
mere
by
product
of
such
review,
surely
cannot
be
considered
as
onerous
as
the
direct
burden
imposed
by
judicial
review
and
the
occasional
invalidation
of
his
official
action.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
does
not
require
federal
courts
to
stay
all
private
actions
against
the
president
until
he
leaves
office.
the
reason
for
rejecting
such
a
categorical
rule
apply
as
well
to
a
rule
that
would
require
a
stay
in
all
but
the
most
exceptional
cases.
the
question
whether
a
specific
case
should
receive
exceptional
treatment
is
more
appropriately
the
subject
of
the
exercise
of
judicial
discretion
than
an
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
accordingly,
we
turn
to
the
question
whether
the
district
court’s
decision
to
stay
the
trial
until
after
the
president
leaves
office
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
although
we
have
rejected
the
argument
that
the
potential
burdens
on
the
president
violates
separation
of
power
and
principle,
those
burdens
are
appropriate
matters
for
the
district
court
to
evaluate
in
its
management
of
the
case.
the
higher
respect
that
is
owned
to
the
office
of
the
chief
executive,
though
not
justifying
a
rule
of
categorical
immunity
is
a
matter
that
should
inform
the
conduct
of
the
entire
proceeding
including
the
timing
and
scope
of
discovery.
nevertheless,
we
are
persuaded
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
defer
this
trial
until
after
the
president
leaves
office.
such
a
lengthy
and
categorical
state
takes
no
account
whatever
of
the
respondent’s
interest
in
bringing
the
case
to
trial.
delaying
trials
always
increases
the
danger
of
prejudice
resulting
from
the
loss
of
evidence
including
the
inability
of
witnesses
to
recall
specific
facts
or
the
possible
death
of
a
party.
moreover,
the
proponent
of
a
stay
bears
the
burden
of
establishing
its
need.
other
than
the
fact
that
a
trial
may
consume
some
of
the
president’s
time
and
attention,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
identify
any
potential
harm
that
might
ensue
from
scheduling
the
trial
promptly
after
discovery
is
concluded.
the
federal
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
case.
like
every
other
citizen
who
properly
invokes
that
jurisdiction,
respondent
has
a
right
to
an
orderly
disposition
of
her
claim.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
