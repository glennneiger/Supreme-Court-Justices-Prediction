they
do.
and
i
take
it,
just
fading
memories
of
witnesses,
over
a
period
of,
say,
4
or
5
years,
would
not
be
sufficient
to
invoke
the
exception
provision
that
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
record
in
fitzgerald
was
based
on
a
fear
that
unless
you
gave
the
president
absolute
immunity,
as
i
understand
the
opinion,
you...
you...
he
would
not
vigorously
exercise
his
official
powers
as
president.
i
don't
see
how
that
element
is
involved
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bennett.
general
dellinger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
good...
a
good
deal
of
your
federal
official
immunity
for
federal
comes
by
statute
from
congress,
not
from
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
of
course
isn't...
we're
not
faced
with
a
situation
where
congress
has
passed
a
law
granting
this
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely
the
range
of
matters--
--surely
that
may
be
true
of
an
individual
with
an
ordinary
job,
but
with
all
the
pressing
concerns
that
the
president
has,
one
would
think
it
would
be
less
true
of
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
dellinger.
mr.
davis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
goes
beyond
my
question,
you
understand.
let
him
answer
justice
o'connor's
question.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
davis,
i
don't
think
you're
answering
some
of
the
questions
quite
as
frankly
as
we
might
hope
you
would.
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
could
consider
it
isn't
to
say
whether
he's
bound
by
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
is
a
difference
between
a
president's
claim
simply
saying,
i
can't
come
now.
is
that
conclusive
on
the
court?
it
seems
to
me...
or
does
the
court
have
an
obligation,
or
at
least
is
it
permissible
to
weigh
the
court's
own
evaluation
of
the
president's
claim?
i
think
i
would
like
and
i
think
my
colleagues
would
like
your
answers
to
those
questions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
witnesses'
memories
also
fade,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-1853,
clinton
against
jones
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
