justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
request
to
totally
dismiss
the
suit
or
to
permit
delay
of
the
trial
and
any
court
appearance...
in-court
appearance
or
that
position
or
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
discovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
discovery
of
people
who
are
not
the
president,
other
witnesses
and
things
like
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you...
you
want
to
delay
that
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
that
be
a
general
rule
if
preservation
of
evidence
becomes
crucial
in
a
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
it's
federal
sovereignty.
but
i...
i
agree
with
the
concerns
expressed
in
the
question
by
justice
kennedy
that
it's
if
it
were
a
suit
in
state
court.
it
is
very
difficult
to
shoehorn
it
into
some
kind
of
separation
of
powers
notion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
supremacy
clause...
i
don't
know
whether
that
bears
on
it...
but
certainly
not
separation
of
powers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but...
but
there
are...
there
are
two
elements
here
really...
a
concern
about
some
conflict
with
a
judge
deciding
how
to
weigh
the
interests
of
the
president
in
attending
a
nato
meeting
or
something
versus
a
desire
to
avoid
damage
control
politically.
i
mean,
is
there
an
element
of
that
in
here?
and
does
that
enter
into
the
constitutional
balance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yet
could
be
the
concern
about
damage
control,
at
bottom,
would
motivate,
not
necessarily
this
president,
but
any
president,
in
wanting
to
spend
a
little
time
with
the
lawyer
as
these
allegations
are
made.
but
is
that
part
of
our
constitutional
balance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
to
the
extent
that
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
involved
some
activity
of
the
president
that
relates
to
his
duties
in
office
as
president,
that
is
an
element
that
does
not
extend
to
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
may
have
been
folsom
language,
as
there
often
is,
in
court
opinions.
but
we
have
to
get
back
to
the
basic
source
of
what
is
it
in
the
constitution
that
we
look
to,
to
govern
this...
this
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
dellinger,
suppose
it's
a
child
custody
matter.
sometime
in
the
future,
we
have
some
president
who
doesn't
get
along
with
a
spouse,
and
there's
a
child
custody
problem.
there's
no
right
to
go
into
a
state
court
and
get
temporary
relief,
so
that
the
child
knows
where
the
child
is
going
to
be
for
the
next
8
years
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
there's
no
automatic
rule
that
the
court
has
to
dismiss
the
minute
the
thing
is
filed;
you
acknowledge
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
suppose
a
president
in
the
future
owns
some
part...
great
parcel
of
land
somewhere
and
it's
bubbling
up
with
poisons.
and
all
the
neighbors
are
upset
because
of
the
environmental
damage.
no
temporary
injunction
possibility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
that
rule,
the
court
wouldn't
have
to
make
any
decision.
under
the
rule
proposed
by
the
question
you
were
answering,
the
minute
that
is
asserted,
the
court
says,
hands
off,
i'm
out
of
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
you
don't
defend
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
did
you
file
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari
then
on
some
ground?
the
court
below
permitted,
as
i
understand
it,
some
discovery--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
go
forward,
but
you
take
the
position
that
that
discovery
may
not
go
forward
if
the
president
asserts,
gee,
this
is
taking
my
time.
you're
deposing
witness
x
out
there
in
the
state
of
arkansas
but
it's
consuming
my
time
to
look
at
it.
therefore,
you're
off
the
hook.
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
is
precisely
what
you
just
told
justice
breyer
is
the
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
thing
you're
asserting?
i
just
am
totally
confused
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
depositions
of
third
parties
out
of
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
the
president
comes
in
and
says,
look,
i
want
to
keep
track
of
this
stuff,
i
need
to
meet
with
my
lawyer,
and
i
want
to
see
what's
going
on
here,
it's
interfering
with
my
duties,
what
is
the
lower
court
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
trial
court
judge
at
the
state
court
level
is
to
determine
whether
the
offer...
the
complaint
made
by
the
president's
lawyer
is
made
in
good
faith
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
president's
attorney
came
before
the
court
at
the
cert
stage
and
asserted
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
this
is
causing
the
president
to
spend
too
much
time
on
this.
you,
supreme
court,
lay
off.
it's
bothering
my
duties.
i'm
very
interested
in
this
issue,
and
it's
taking
my
time.
what
is
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
we
have
an
issue
of
law
that
is
consuming
a
great
deal
of
time,
effort,
and
anxiety.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
holding
of
the
eighth
circuit
that
we're
reviewing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
sounds
different
to
me
than
what
we
read
in
the
sixth--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
eighth
circuit
opinion.
