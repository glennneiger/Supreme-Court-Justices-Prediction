mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
william
jefferson
clinton,
the
citizen,
who
holds
the
office
of
the
presidency
of
the
united
states,
advances
the
novel
claim
of
immunity
from
the
progress
of
litigation
while
he
is
president.
this
immunity
he
derives,
he
says,
from
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
of
our
constitution,
and
he
further
contends
that
the
judicial
branch
of
government
must
suspend
the
processing
of
paula
corbin
jones'
lawsuit
until
he
is
out
of
office,
potentially
for
a
period
of
7
years
after
the
date
of
her
filing
of
the
suit.
this
novel
proposition
has
three
fundamental
errors.
the
first
error
is
to
confuse
the
office
of
the
presidency,
which
has
privileges
and
immunities
which
protect
its
institutional
duties,
with
the
person
who
holds
that
office
who,
in
his
private
capacity
and
personal
capacity
has
no
such
privileges
and
immunities
and
instead
has
the
same
rights
and
responsibilities
as
all
other
citizens.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
your
honor--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--justice
scalia...
no,
i
say
that
there
is
a
remedy
for
that.
first,
the
bright
line
test
that
the
court
should
seek
here,
i
think,
is
that
you
look
first
to
an
actual,
imminent
interference
with
official
duty.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
justice
ginsburg...
i'm
not
sure
who
i
should
respond
to
first,
but--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--justice
ginsburg,
there
are
ample
traditional
powers.
we
don't
have
to
shift
burdens
of
proof
or
any
other
special
mechanism
here.
there
are
traditional
powers
of
the
court
which
must
be
presumed
to
exercise
those
to
protect
the
president
from
interference
with
his
job,
ex
parte
conferences,
and
the
like.
justice
scalia,
your
question
as
to
what
do
you
do
if
a
judge
does
not
and
is
not
sensitive
to
the
demands
of
the
presidency
and
the
time
required
by
the
occupant
of
that
office
to
perform
the
functions,
i
think
there
are
several
potential
remedies.
i'm
not
certain
that
i
could
exhaust
them
all,
but
mandamus,
prohibition.
certainly
all
roads
lead
to
this
court.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
no,
i
think
first
the
president
must
make
the
claim,
if
he--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
hope
i'm
not
on
unsettling
ground
here,
but
i
would
suggest,
as
justice
o'connor
i
think
first
mentioned,
that
the
supremacy
clause,
the
structure...
and
here
is
a
separation
of
powers
issue
perhaps,
at
least
where
the
constitution
parceled
out,
structurally,
power
and
gave
to
the
president
all
executive
power.
if
a
state
or
federal
court,
and
i'm
not
certain
that
it
makes
any
difference
whatsoever,
were
to
interfere
in
such
a
way
or
permit
an
interference--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
think
the
simple
assertion--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
think--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
would
allow
it
to
control
with
this
possible
caveat.
if
it
happened
10
times
in
a
row,
and
there
was
a
question
of
good
faith,
i
think
the
court...
i
don't
think
the
court
can
exercise
any
jurisdiction
over
his
person.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
well,
i
would
agree.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
i
think
that
the
rule
here,
justice
breyer,
is
an
actual,
imminent
interference
with
his
job
and
a
claim
that
he
makes.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
i
think
that
may
well
be
an
interference.
it's
the
same
kind
of
interference
that
you
would
have
that's
posed,
this
torrent
of
litigation
that
might
occur.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
on
the
torrent
of
litigation,
or
how--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--justice
breyer,
if
he
relates
that
to
his
official
duties
so
that
it
is
taking
his
time
and
his
mental
processes
away
from
his
official
duties,
then
i
think
that
is
an
interference
that
would
justify
him
not--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--oh,
no.
no,
sir--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--no.
no,
i
am
defending--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
all
right.
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
clear
the
confusion.
what
i
am
suggesting,
and
it's
in
the
context
of
the
depositions
that
justice
breyer
raised
this--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--it's
hard
to
conceive
that
they
would
be--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
i
think
the
lower
court
has
its
function
and
its
duty
to
decide
whether
that
is
a
good
faith
claim.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
and
if
it
is
not,
then
you
may
have
a
conflict
between
the
person
of
the
president
and
a
judge.
he
would
respond.
he
would
just
go
to
the--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
think
he
must
make
the
claim
of
actual
interference
with
his
duties,
that
as
another
example,
the
torrent
of
litigation
has
come...
is
so
much,
that
i
am
only
responding
now
to
civil
complaints.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
i
don't--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
don't
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
constitution
protects
him
in
his
personal
capacity.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
i
don't
think
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
is
a
fact-finding
body
on
that
subject.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
yes,
but
that
issue
again
is
a
matter
to
be
addressed
to
a
trial
judge,
who
is--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
i
think
the
court...
i
think...
perhaps
i
should
also
suggest
that
a
court
suspicious
of
the
good
faith
of
that
assertion--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--is
entitled
to
require
a
showing,
just
as
in
the--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--goes
to
the
interference,
whether--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
the
good
faith
as
a
rule
of
law,
as
a
practical
matter
in--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
the
immunity
question,
if
it
exists,
if
the
concept
that
has
been
suggested
to
this
court
of
temporal
immunity,
if
it
exists,
bars
proceedings
whether
they're
pretrial
or
trial.
if
that
arises
under
the
separation
of
powers,
then
it
bars
it
all.
if
it
does
not,
it
does
not
bar
either
the
pretrial
or
the
trial
subject
to
an
actual
interference.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
i
don't
think
it's
a
privilege.
i
think
what
he
would
be
saying
is,
a
procedure
has
happened
here.
i
can't--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
i
think
the
best
way
to
call
this
is
a
trial.
let's
talk
about
a
trial.
he's
anticipating
7
days
worth
of
trial,
and
i
can't
be
in
court
for
7
days,
and--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
think
the
trial
judge
always
has
the
opportunity
and
the
duty
to
balance
the
interests--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
don't
think
he
is
bound--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
do
believe,
chief
justice,
that
a
court
has,
if
it
is
suspicious
of
a
president's
assertion
of
a
claim,
has
a
right
to
inquire
into
the
bona
fides
of
that
claim,
and
if
the
court
found
in
its
belief
that
the
president
did
not
make
that
claim
and
that
there...
properly
that
there
was
not
an
interference
with
his
duties,
i
think
the
court
would
go...
could...
can't
take
any
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
his
person,
but
could
go
forward
with
the
other
kinds
of
remedies
that
it
might
have.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
the
eighth
circuit
never
considered,
i
don't
think,
the
minutiae--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--the
eighth
circuit
said--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--no,
the
eighth
circuit
said
that,
sensitive
to
proper
judicial
case
management
and
sensitive
to
the
interests
of
the
parties,
including
the
president,
this
case
should
proceed,
and
i--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--responding
as
a
sensitivity
to
those
questions.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
i
would
not
find
it
acceptable
because
i
think
the
presumption
is
that
this
case,
which
does
not
have
a
risk
to
it
in
the
likely
event
that
it
goes
forward...
if
it
were
to
go
forward
does
not
have
a
risk
of
interference
with
the
functions
of
the
presidency,
and
it's
a
case
of
a--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--he
has
given
depositions,
and
he
has
arranged
his
calendar,
and
the
court
would...
under
the
new
federal
rules,
as
i
understand
it,
would
have
a
conference
with
him,
what
protections
do
you
need,
and
would...
could
enter
an
order
to
that,
and
he
gives
available
dates.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
most
of
these
circumstances
my
brother
mr.
bennett
i'm
sure
would
be
accommodating
to
arrange
with
us,
without
the
involvement
of
the
court
at
all,
the
time
and
place
and
date,
and
the
availability
of
the
president,
and
if
he
said,
hey,
i've
got
something
else
to
do,
i'm
sure
counsel
would
do
it.
if
they
didn't
do
it,
then
of
course
you
go
to
the
court,
but
to
say--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
his
option
is
just
not
to
obey,
because
i
have
a--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--constitutional
and
statutory
function
to
perform.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
he
could
suffer
judgment.
there's
the
appellate
process
for
that.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
well,
the
question
came
to
me
initially
and
my
bright
line
rule
was
not
the
good
faith
rule,
it
was
the
actual
imminent
risk
to
the
president
performing
his
duties,
and
an
assertion
of
the
claim,
and
we
got
to
the
point
of
the
assertion
of
the
claim,
and
i
merely
suggested
that
the...
that
if
the
president
was
not
in
good
faith
10
times
in
a
row,
that
the
court
might
make
an
inquiry
into
that.
i
did
not
suggest
to
the
court
that
the...
necessarily
that
that
was
a...
the
rule
of
law
that
we
would
necessarily
seek.
i
think
the
president
would
act
in
good
faith.
if
he
did
not
act
in
it,
the
court
may
have
the
right
to
inquire.
i
don't
think
that
is
before
us.
what
is
before
us
is
a
private
action.
the
president
has
a
private
capacity.
he
should
be...
he
should
go
forward
with
the
case,
and
if--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
what
is
at
stake,
and
this
is...
these
interests
i
think
are
substantial
to
the
plaintiff.
she
can
lose
her
cause
of
action
if
either
she
or
the
president
dies.
it
is
extinguished,
as
the
eighth
circuit
concurring
opinion
points
out.
she
has
her
reputation.
you
talk
about
how
important
this
case
is.
it's
a
civil
rights
case
partially
and
state's
claims,
but
reputation
is
what
we
take
to
our
grave
probably
more
than
anything
else,
and
while
she's
alive
that
reputation
is
sullied.
the
implicit...
well,
the
implication
of
the
article
was
that
she
was
a
compliant
female.
if
that
is
the
case,
we
can
imagine
that
she
goes
for
a
job
and
an
employers
says,
i'm
not
so
sure
whether
you
made
a
valid
claim
here
or
not.
i
don't
want
to
be
the
next
employer
that
you
charge.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
no,
no,
but
you
asked
me
what
interests
are
involved
in
the
delay.
in
addition
to
that,
obviously,
the
course
of
human
experience,
we
don't
know
when
witnesses
will
die.
we
certainly
can't
say,
well,
there's
an
emergency
because
somebody's
going
to
die
tomorrow
who's
not
ill.
that
is
a
common
experience,
and
that's
why
justice
delayed
has
often--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--they
fade,
and
they
become
incapacitated.
the
documents
get
lost
or
mislaid.
so
her
case
could
be
utterly
destroyed,
and
she
could--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--but
discovery
depositions,
your
honor?
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
where
leads
are
developed?
i'm
not
certain
that
mr.
bennett
would
permit
that.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
mr.
bennett
i
found
to
be
very
accommodating,
but
this
court
is
going
to
be
enunciating
a
constitutional
doctrine.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
that
is
the
remedy
that
the
president...
that
the
president
could
seek
if
he
fears
this
interference.
i
think
if
there's--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--oh,
i
think--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--yes.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
i...
the
justice...
chief
justice
burger
was
very
skeptical
of
that.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
it,
in
dicta,
in
justice
powell's
opinion.
my
own
view
is
that
if
there
is
an
immunity
that
arises
under
the
constitution
and
the
separation
of
powers,
that
congress
by
some
affirmative
act
that
says
a
president
now
doesn't
have
that
protection,
i
would
be
very
skeptical
whether
congress
could
do
it.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
yes,
sir,
but
that--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--justice
scalia,
i'm
not
sure
i
want
to
be
a
part
of
that.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
that
would
be
mine.
[laughter]
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
other--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--yes,
but
it
is
not
here.
we
would...
and
the
fitzgerald
opinion
did
talk
about
presidential
immunities
and
the
sources
of
them,
and
there
were
four
sources.
the
presidency
was
a
recent,
much
more
recent
development
than
the
development
of
the
common
law,
and
so
look
for
any
immunity
that
the
president
has
in
the
constitution
itself,
which
deals
with
official
power,
and
that's
purely
our
point
here.
unless
there
is
an
immunity
that
arises
constitutionally,
then
there
should
be
no
bar
to
the
progress
of
this
litigation
with
the
courts
sensitive
to
the
burdens
of
the
presidency
and
should
be
trusted
to
do
so.
that's
another,
i
think
fundamental
problem
with
our
opponents,
is
that
they
do
not
have
a
presumption
of
trust
that
the
court
will
deal
with
these
matters--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--this
is
a
very,
relatively
simple,
as
far
as
fact
pattern
case.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
i--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--depending
on
stipulations,
justice
stevens,
i
would
say
4
or
5
days
perhaps,
but
that's
just
a
guess,
and
it
may...
and
we
don't
know
if
the
case
will
be
narrowed
by--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
i'm
thinking
of
what
some
jurisdictions
do.
in
virginia,
in
federal
or
state
court
it
would
take
probably...
it
would
take
a
half-an-hour
in
the
eastern
district,
but--
[laughter]
but
i
don't
think
it
will
take
very
long,
and
there's
a
point
to
be
made
about
that
also.
with
today's
technology,
with
live
feeds
or
transcripts
and
continuances
from
day-to-day,
or
whenever
the
president
feels
that
he
can--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--i
can't,
and
i
wouldn't
bind,
because
i'm
not
certain
whether
they
are
admissible.
i'm
not
certain
what
they...
if
they
would
tend
to
show
a
fact
that
we
need
to
prove
i
think
i
would
be
duty
bound
as
counsel
to
pursue
that.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
it
could
very
well
be.
it
could
very
well
be,
and--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--if
there
was
no
way,
at
that
time...
this
is
ab
initio,
but
at
that
time,
if
there
was
no
other
way
to
accommodate
his
needs,
the
presidency's
needs
for
him
to
perform
that
job,
then
a
continuance
might
very
well
be
appropriate.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
he
may
indeed--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--if
he
wants
to
avoid
a
trial.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
in
an
appropriate
circumstance,
and
you're
getting
to
the
question
of
a
stay
by
the
district
judge
as
a
discretionary
matter
rather
than
as
a--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
i
think
she
did
this--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--well,
the
court
needs
to
have
a
factual
basis
on
which
to
exercise
discretion.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
if
they
do
provide
a
factual
basis
that
justifies
a
continuance--
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
--then
certainly
the
court
has
authority
to
do
it.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
that's
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
exactly.
mr.
gilbert
k.
davis
that's
all
we're
arguing
about,
yes,
sir.
let
me
just
conclude
by
saying
this,
that
what
the
president
is
seeking
would
require
a
number
of
changes.
they
suggest
burden
of...
changes
as
to
compelling
cases,
that
he
doesn't
need
this,
that
the
burden
be
on
the
plaintiff,
and
to
delay
it
is
a
situation
that
would
be
highly
unusual
in
the
normal
course,
and
we
don't
need
it.
the
power
of
the
court
to
deal
with
this
is
ample.
if
it
proves
not
to
be
ample,
as
in
justice
souter's
example--
