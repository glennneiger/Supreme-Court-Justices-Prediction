doesn't
that
effectively
mean
that
you
can't
devise
it
to
the
people
you
are
most
likely
to
want
to
devise
it
to?
i
mean,
i
presume
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
people
who
are
already
owners
of
the
parcel
are
related
to
you,
or
lineal
descendants
of
yours,
so
i
suppose
that
really
cancels
out
most
of
the
prospective
devises,
doesn't
it?
justice

h.

no,
but
let's
take
one
of
the
mechanisms.
it's
perfectly
true
that
for
these
minuscule
interests
it
may
be
very
cumbersome
even
to
get
the
ball
rolling
by
going
into
court
in
the
normal
course,
filing
petitions
and
so
on.
but
the
government
can
certainly
provide
a
simplified
partition
scheme,
for
example,
that
would,
i
suppose,
just
allow
an
extremely
simple
filing
before
an
administrative
officer
with
a
low
filing
fee
or
none
at
all,
and
that
would
be
a
way
of
bringing
a
kind
of
normal
market
mechanism
adapted
to
the
particular
problem
that
the
government
has
caused.
why
can't
the
government
do
something
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
there
be
a
payment
requirement
there?
i
would
suppose
that
precluding
further
fractionalization
was
not
going
to
make
the
land
worth
less,
so
you're
saying
the
value
would
be
simply
the
value
of
the
capacity
to
fractionize.
