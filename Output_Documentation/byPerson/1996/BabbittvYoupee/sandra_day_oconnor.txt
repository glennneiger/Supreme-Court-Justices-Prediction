mr.
feldman,
in
this
case,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
did
the
disposition
of
the
land
in
question
further
fractionalize
it
or
did
one
person
take
each
interest
as
a
whole?
i
mean,
one
daughter
took
some,
and
a
son
took
all
of
another,
the
interest
in
another
tract,
and
so
on?
it
was
not
further
fractionalized,
was
it,
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
make
a
difference,
do
you
think,
in
our
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
nevertheless
thought
it
was
a
taking
in
that
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
let's
talk
about
the
amended
version
a
little.
subsection
(a)
of
207
says
if
the
land
is
incapable
of
earning
$100
in
any
one
of
the
5
years
from
the
date
of
decedent's
death,
and
where
the
factional
interest
has
earned
its
owner
less
than
$100
in
any
one
of
the
5
years
before
the
decedent's
death
there's
a
rebuttable
presumption--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
applies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
would
be
the
normal
reading
of
it,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
had
a
hard
time
understanding
your
reading
of
it,
which
would
read
in
the
word
each
of
the
5
years.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
government
could
purchase
these
small
interests,
or
take
them
by
eminent
domain--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--paying
something,
and
i
guess
the
government
also
could
help
the
tribes
do
just
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
congress
has
imposed
so
many
detailed
requirements
on
efforts
by
the
tribes
to
consolidate.
maybe
some
of
those
could
be
eliminated--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
make
it
simpler.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
does
the
amended
statute
prevent
descent,
i
assume
without
a
will,
of
an
interest
even
where
the
descent
under
the
circumstances
would
result
in
a
consolidation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
seems
to
say
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
says
nothing
in
this
section
shall
prohibit
the
devise--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
such
an
escheatable
fractional
interest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
there's
an
intestate
succession--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--even
if
it
results
in
a
consolidation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because,
of
course,
with
non-indian
property
there
are
state
and
local
taxes
applicable,
and
if
the
owner
doesn't
pay
them
for
a
period
of
time,
there
are
procedures
that
the
state
or
county
can
go
through
to
forfeit
the
property
for
nonpayment
of
taxes.
mr.
martell,
regarding
justice
breyer's
question
about
changing
the
escheat
law,
or
changing
the
inheritance
laws,
i
suppose
there's
a
difference,
is
there
not,
for
purpose
of
takings
law,
as
to
whether
you
have
a
general
state
law
or
federal
law
that
is
applicable
to
all
property
owners
versus
a
law
that
simply
picks
out
a
few
property
owners,
or
one
class
of
property.
for
example,
i
think
we'd
have
a
different
question
before
us
if
on
the
one
hand
the
state
law
said,
property
escheats
in
just
2
years
instead
of
8
throughout
the
state,
versus
a
law
that
picks
out
a
particular
class
of
property
owners
and
just
says,
we're
going
to
make
an
exception
from
the
normal
state
law
for
you,
and
your
property
shall
escheat
more
quickly.
there
might
be
a
takings
issue
in
the
latter
case
when
there
isn't
in
the
former.
aren't
you
relying
to
some
extent
on
the
fact
this
is
not
a
general,
you
know,
intestate
disposition
law?
it's
one
targeted
at
a
particular
class
of
property
owners.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
other
words,
this
decedent
left
his
interests
in
such
a
way
that
there
was
no
further
fractionalization--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
real
property
interests.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
you
clarify
for
me...
this
case
does
not
further
subdivide
the
interests,
but
the
government
says
even
if
it
did
it
would
be
valid.
if
it
further
fractionalized
the
interests--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
government
says
that
would
be
valid.
what
is
your
position
on
that?
can
the
congress
prohibit
further
fractionalization?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
i
didn't
find
that
you
took
a
position
in
your
briefs.
