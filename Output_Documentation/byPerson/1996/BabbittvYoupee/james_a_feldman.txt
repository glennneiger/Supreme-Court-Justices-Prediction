mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
section
2...
of
the
amended
version
of
section
207
of
the
indian
land
consolidation
act.
the
unamended
version
of
this
statute
was
before
this
court
almost
10
years
ago
in
hodel
v.
irving,
and
the
court
found
it
unconstitutional.
our
submission
is
that
the
amended
statute
remedies
the
flaws
that
this
court
found
in
the
original
version
of
the
statute,
and
the
amended
statute
is
therefore
constitutional.
now,
the
purpose...
the
statute
arose
as
a
response
to
what
this
court
has
characterized
in
hodel
as
the
extraordinary
problem
of
extreme
fractionation
of
indian
trust
lands.
such
extreme
fractionation
when
many
people
combine
to
own
undivided
interests
in
single
parcels
of
land
makes
productive
use
of
the
land
very
difficult.
if
a
given
parcel
has
a
large
number,
sometimes
in
the
hundreds
of
different
owners,
it's
very
hard
for
anyone
to
take
initiative
to
see
to
it
that
the
parcel
is
put
to
a
productive
economic
use.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
i
mean,
actually...
in
respect
to
one
parcel
of
land
was
further
fractionated,
but
that
was
not
a
parcel
that
was
subject
to
a--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
was
small
enough--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
decedent--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
in
hodel
v.
irving
what
the
court
held
was
that
the
extreme
fractionation
is
a
serious
problem,
and
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
it
was
a
taking
because...
because
such
small...
because...
excuse
me.
let
me
start
again.
the
court
held
in
hodel
that
there
was
a
taking
because
it
completely
and
totally
eliminated
all
rights
of
descent
and
devise
for
the
land
and,
as
the
court
said
twice
in
its
opinion,
even
when
permitting
descent
or
devise
would
result
in
a
consolidation
of
the
land.
in
this
case
none
of
the...
none
of
the
interest
that
they
had
passed
effectively
through
the
will
would
have
resulted
in
such
a
consolidation
of
the
land
and,
indeed,
in
hodel
v.
irving
when
the
court...
in
one
of
the
places
where
the
court
made
that
comment
it
put
a
cf
cite
specifically
to
the
amended
version
of
the
statute.
now,
the
amended
version
of
the
statute
in
our
view
remedies
the
flaws
in
the
original
statue
in
two
ways.
in
the
first
place,
in
connection
with
the
economic
impact
of
the
statute,
the
amended...
the
original
statute
required
that
land
be
escheated
if
in
the
1
year
prior
to
the
decedent's
death
it
had
not
earned
more
than
$100,
and
if
the
interest
involved
was
less
than
2
percent.
the
amended
version
of
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
i
may,
if
i
can
take
the
first
passage
that
you
quoted,
it's
our
position
that
that
is
ambiguous,
and
that
the...
it
is
true
that
the
any
one...
incapable
of
earning
$100
in
any
one
of
the
5
years
could
mean
in
any
of
the
5
years
or
in
any
one--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no...
well,
i
think
any
in
some
circumstances
can
mean
each,
especially
when
it's
conjoined
with
the
negative,
but
let
me
just
abstract
from
that
for
a
minute.
in
the
first
place,
that
issue
isn't
presented
by
this
case
because
no
one
has
claimed
that
our
reading
of
the
statute
in
this
case
was
wrong,
but
more
importantly,
the
kinds
of
lands
that
we're
generally
dealing
with
here
are
lands
that
are
useful
primarily
for
grazing
or
for
mineral
leasing,
and
as
a
general
matter
it
doesn't
really
make...
it
will
be
a
very
small
number
of
cases
where
which
year
you're
looking
at
is
going
to
be
an
important
factor.
if
it
can
be
leased
for
a
5-year
period
for
grazing,
it
will
be
leased
at
about
the
same
amount
of
money
every
year.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
and
if
it
can
be
leased
for
timber
harvest
it
might
be
more
than
a
5-year
period
that
a
lease
would
permit,
but
still--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
as
our
reading
of
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
in
our
reading
of
the
statute,
because
the
other
key
part
of
the
change
is
not
only
that
it
changed
to
a
5-year
period,
but
the
question
is
whether
it's
capable,
not
whether
in
fact
in
any
given
year
it
earns
an
amount--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
but
it...
i
think
it
does
go
to
the
fact
that
congress
more
carefully
tailored
what
it
did
in
this
statute
to
just
those
interests
that
were
causing
the
serious
problem.
when
someone
owns
the
smallest
interest
that
was
involved
in
this
case...
i
think
it
was
5/1000ths
of
the
parcel,
and
when
people--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
goes--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but
congress
was
trying
to
define
a
category
of
land
that
was
really
causing
the
problem,
and
in
the
amended
version
of
the
act
it
acted
much
more
closely
and
precisely
to
target
that
particular
land.
for
example,
by
referring
to
land
that's
capable
of
earning
$100
rather
than
land
that
had
in
a
certain
year
earned
$100,
someone
whose
land
might
escheat
might
go
into
a
court
and
say,
well,
this
can
be
harvested
for
timber
every
15
years,
therefore
i
can
lease
the
land
to
somebody
for
a
15-year
period,
and
if
the
annual
rental
on
that
lease
will
result
in
more
than
$100
for
me,
then
i'm
out
of
the
statute.
it's...
it
was
really
the
change
to
a
capable-of-earning
standard
as
much
as
focusing
on
the
5
years
versus
1
year
that
was
significant.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
that
in
fact
the
two
key
things
that
the
court
pointed
out
in
hodel
that
it
was
most
concerned
about
were
first
that
this...
taking
just
one
arbitrary
year
before
the
decedent
died
might
really
result
in
the
escheat
of
very
valuable
interest,
and
secondly
that
it
completely
and
totally
abolished
all
descent
and
devise,
even
in
cases
where
descent
and
devise
might
consolidate
interests.
what
congress
did
was,
it
remedied
the
first
problem
primarily
by
talking
about
capable
of
earning,
rather
than
just
what
it
had
in
fact
earned,
and
in
addition
by
setting
up
this
5-year
window
rather
than
just
1
year
before
the
decedent's
death,
and
it
dealt
with
the
second
problem
by
permitting
devise
in
precisely
those
cases
where
the
devise
would
result
in
consolidation
of
the
property.
the
kind
of
property
interest
that
we're
talking
about
here,
the
smallest
interest
in
this
case,
as
i
said,
was
something
like
5/1000ths
of
a
percent,
and
people
who
own
that
small
of
a
property
interest
can't
reasonably
be
expected,
or
at
least
very
infrequently
will
take
enough
of
an
interest
in
the
property
to
do
anything
with
it
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think,
as
i
read
the...
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion,
what
it
was
speaking
of
was
the
complete
and
total
and
absolute
abrogation
of
rights
of
descent
and
devise.
after
all,
the
court
reaffirmed
a
long
line
of
precedent
that
had
held
that
the
government
has
very
broad
authority
to
regulate
the
rules
of
descent
and
devise.
in
this
case,
this
kind
of
rule
is
analogous
both
to
typical
escheat
rules,
which
are
kind
of
abandonment
rules,
where
you
have
a
very
small
interest,
you
can't
really
expect
the
owner
to
do
anything,
he
doesn't
have
enough
of
an
economic
incentive
to
ever
do
anything
with
the
property,
even
to
return
a
post
card,
perhaps,
that...
where
someone
proposes
a
use
of
the
property
that
requires
his
consent,
and
what
congress
was
saying
was,
if
that's
the
kind
of
interest
you
have,
that
is
imposing
serious
costs
on
the
community,
and
we're
going
to
presume
that
you
abandoned
it
unless
you
did
one
of
three
things.
either,
during
your
lifetime,
you
unite
it
with
another
interest
and
consolidate
your
interest
and
get
above
the
2
percent
threshold,
or
second,
you
can
dispose
of
the
property
during
your
lifetime
and
thereby...
and
pass
on...
you
can
certainly
pass
on
any
money
that
you're
able
to
realize
by
disposing
it
to
your
heirs
by
descent
or
devise,
or
however
it
can
be
passed
on,
or
three,
you
can
pass
it
on
by...
through...
after
your
death,
through
a
probate
proceeding,
but
you
can
only
devise
it
to
somebody
who
already
owns
an
interest
in
the
same
property.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
actually
don't
think
that's
true.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
very
case
one
of
the
six
respondents
got
three
properties
that
she
wouldn't
otherwise
have
gotten,
because
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
decedent,
and
she
already
owned
interest
in
those
properties.
but
more
generally,
what's
caused
the
problem
that
congress
was
addressing
here
was
kind
of...
was
rules
of
descent,
was
primarily
rules
of
descent
that
allowed
the
land
to
be
fractionated
over
the
years,
and
frequently
the
land
will
be
held
within
a
given
lineal
family.
perhaps
it's
branched
out
quite
a
bit
by
the
time
it
gets
to
the
third
or
fourth
generation.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
so
generally
it
will
be
other...
or
at
least,
very
frequently
it
will
be
other
people
who
you
do
have
a
family
tie
to,
who
are--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--you
might
be.
you
might
well
be,
although
as
i
said
in
this
case
one
of
the
people
was
a
daughter,
but
certainly
many
of
them,
some
of
the
other
five
didn't
get
any
land
on
that
basis,
and
didn't
already
own
interest
in
the
parcels.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
the
court...
i
would
say
the
court
also
said
in
hodel
the
difference
in
this
case
from
the
other
cases
that
the
court
reaffirmed
that
have
affirmed
the
authority
of
the
sovereign
to
set
rules
of
descent
and
devise,
the
difference
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
descent
and
devise
are
completely
abolished.
indeed,
they
are
abolished
even
in
circumstances
where
the
governmental
purpose
sought
to
be
advanced
does
not
conflict
with
the
further
descent
of
the
property.
but
i
think,
stepping
aside
for
a
minute,
whether
the
court's...
and,
indeed,
i
think
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
the
question
of
whether
hodel
rested
on
the
complete
abrogation
of
descent
or
devise,
or
rested
on
a
rule
that
would
much
more
severely
restrict
the
sovereign's
ability
to
regulate
descent
or
devise.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think...
there's
nothing
i
can...
i
can't
answer
that
i
can
give
you
an
example
of
any
particular
statute
that
does...
that
restricts
the
category
of
lineal
devisees
so
thoroughly,
although
there
may
be
statutes
that
give...
include...
they
give
an
interest
to
a
spouse,
for
example,
over
the
interests
of
children,
or
something
like
that,
that
could
in
some
circumstances
have
that
effect,
but
there
have
been,
and
the
court
have
upheld
statutes
that
have
restricted
devise
to
one's
children.
under
the
common
law,
i
believe,
you
couldn't
devise
property
to
an
alien,
real
property,
and
even
if
the
alien
happened
to
be
your
child,
and
this
court
has
upheld
that.
in
addition,
there
are
in...
there
are
rules
that
some
indian
tribes
have
that
you
can't
devise...
that
you
can't
devise
property--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
i
think
you
really
have
to
look
at
the
unique
character
of
this
property
interest,
the
kinds
of
property
interests
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
unique
because
these
interests
are
extremely
small
fractional
interests,
a
kind
of
fractional
interest
that
very,
very
rarely
exists
outside
of
indian
law,
and
that
the
owners
may
well
in
fact
have
abandoned
the
property.
it's
very
hard
to
tell
whether
they've
abandoned
the
property
because
the
administrative
costs
of
leasing
it
insofar
as
it's
able
to
be
leased,
or
doing
it
with
whatever
can
be
done
are
borne
by
the
united
states,
and
because
they're
not
subject
to
state
taxes,
and
really
one
of...
what...
meanwhile
this
interest
is
both...
i
think
it's
analogous
both
to
cases
where
congress
is
saying
owning
this
kind
of
an
interest
is
in
itself
a
kind
of
a
nuisance
that
has
to
be
abated,
and
if
you
don't
take
state
action,
you
don't
take
action
to
abate
that
nuisance
in
the
course
of
your
lifetime
by--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there
are
limits
on
the
alienation
of
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
not
sure
that
it's
fair,
though,
to
say
that
congress
created...
the
process
of
fractionalization
may
have
been
a
byproduct
of
a
number
of
different
factors,
one
among
them
are
the
fact
that
it's
not
subject
to
state
taxes,
and
that
the
government
bears
the
cost
of
administering
the
property,
and
thereby
it
doesn't
give
anybody
an
incentive
to
determine
whether
this
is
property
that
they
really
want,
and
really
want
to
do
something
with,
or
if
this
is
just
abandoned
property
that
they're
just
going
to
ignore
and
pass
on
to
the
next
generation
in
equal
undivided
interests.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
although
the
magnitude
of
the
problem...
you
know,
each
of
these
interests...
in
this
case
some
of
the
interests
are
an
estimated
value
of
$5,
or
$10,
or
$15,
but
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
over
millions
of
acres
of
indian
land,
where
the
ownership
is
highly
fractionated,
is
very,
very
substantial,
and
congress
reasonably--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
actually--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--actually,
i'm
sure
there's
room
for
improvement
in
the
statutory
schemes
here,
but
in
the
indian
land
consolidation
act
and
some
of
the
other
provisions
that
are
right,
i
think...
this
is
codified
at
29
u.s.c.
2206
at
2205,
4,
3...
there
are
some
other
provisions
congress
enacted
to
enable
tribes
to
take
a
variety
of
actions
to
purchase
land
or
to
consolidate
interests
on
the
reservation.
and
in
fact
in
2206(c),
i
think
it
is,
the
very
section
we're
talking
about,
congress
specifically
indicated
that
if
a
tribe
wanted
to
adopt
a
code
of
inheritance
that
would
deal
with...
that
would
also
deal
with
this
fractionation
problem
in
some
other
way,
that
that
could
be
approved
by
the
secretary--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
sorry,
that
no--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
would
under
this
court's
decision
in
hodel,
in
fact,
at
least,
and
insofar
as
that
was
based
on
prior
cases,
i
think
it
would
violate
the
takings
clause
on
that
basis
as
well.
there
really
wasn't...
although
there
really
wasn't
an
alternative
for
congress'
action
that
it
took
in
this
case,
by...
section
2206
does
two
things.
first,
it
eliminates
the
right
of
devise
of
these
very
small
fractional
interests.
in
doing
that,
the
court
itself
in
hodel
suggested
that
that's
something
that
congress
may
well
want
to...
may
be
able
to
do,
and
indeed,
insofar
as
the
statute
has
only
that
effect,
it
should
be
held
constitutional
insofar
as
it
affects
people
who
didn't
go
to
the
trouble
of
making
a
will
to
determine
who
an
heir
of
a
particular
property
should
be.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
doesn't
do
that,
but
if
you
think
about
it,
it
would
be
a
very,
very
rare
case
where
that
will
happen.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
agree
with
you,
i
think
that
it
would
prevent
any
descent,
that
it's...
what
it's
saying--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but
it
will
be
a
very
unusual
situation
where
descent
would...
descent
was
what
caused
the
problem,
and
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
situation
where
that
would
result
in
consolidation,
because
if
somebody
who
has
an
interest,
passes
it
to
his
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
however
many
there
are
children,
they're
each
going
to
get
a
smaller
part
of
that,
and
even
if
one
of
them
already
owns
a
very
small
interest
in
the
property,
it's
going
to
be
very
unlikely
that
it's
going
to
result
in...
it's
almost
certain
to
result
in
increased
fractionation,
and
so
i
don't
think
congress
had
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
remedy
the
problem,
and
indeed--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
was
just
going
to
say
that
i
do
think,
as
i
was
saying
before,
that
the
statute
should
be...
would
be
constitutional
at
least
insofar
as
it
prohibits
descent,
and
if
there
is
a
case
like
that
out
there--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yeah...
i'm
not
suggesting
the
court
should
decide
any
case
that's
not
before
it,
but
i
do
think...
there's
two
points.
one
is,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
make
clear
that
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge
in
this
case,
and
that
there
are
these
other
kinds
of
cases,
including
a
large
number
where
there's
no
will
at
all,
and
where
the
decedent--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--those
at
least
should
be
left
open--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
it
may
well
be
that
the
court's
reasoning,
although
we
don't...
reasoning...
if
it
were
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
statute's
unconstitutional
as
applied
here,
the
court's
reasoning
may
well
make
clear
that
in
these
other
contexts
it
would
be
constitutional,
albeit
those
cases
themselves
would
be
left
for
another
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it...
i
suppose
it
might
depend
at
least
in
part
on
what
it
is
that
congress
is
intending
to
accomplish
by
that.
if
all
that
congress
is
intending--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
insofar
as
it
deals
with
just
very
small
fractionated
interests,
our
argument
is
that
it
would
be
constitutional,
but
if
a
statute
like
that
also
applied
to,
for
instance,
entire
interests
in
the
property,
then
it's
hard
to
see
what
it
would
be
trying
to
accomplish,
other
than
just...
it
wouldn't
be
remedying
any
kind
of
nuisance--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--for
the
community.
it
wouldn't
be
solving
any
adverse
problem
that
seems
to
be
occurring,
and
i
think
in
those
cases
there
would
be
a
problem
under
the
penn
central
analysis.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i...
it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
it's
possible--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
possible
that
a
statute
like
that
would
be
constitutional
and,
indeed,
there
are
other
contexts--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--to...
it
would
solve--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
believe
it
would...
the
problem
is,
i
don't
believe
it
would
focus
on
those
interests.
it
would...
a
statute...
if
we're
talking
about
a
statute
that
would
limit
devise
of
all
interests
in
allotted
trust
lands,
it
would
sweep
far
more
broadly.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
all
intestate.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
all
intestate
descent.
i
think
it
would
focus
far
more
broadly
than
is
necessary
or
suggested,
but
i
think
the
court...
there
would
be
authority
for
that
kind
of
an
outcome,
if
congress
did
not
act
too
broadly.
for
example,
in
united
states
v.
locke,
and
in
texaco
v.
short,
the
court
dealt
with
cases
that
involved
people
who,
in
order
to
maintain
a
very
real
ownership
interest...
in
this
case
i
think
it
was
mineral
leases...
they
had
to
take
some
kind
of
action
like
filing
a
paper
or
something
like
that
with
a
recorder
of
deeds.
if
that
kind
of
thing
were
required,
if
a
will
were
seen
as
equivalent
to
taking
that
kind
of
action,
then
i
think
a
statute
like
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes
i...
i
can
only
answer
that
i
think
that
it
may
be
that
you
could
do
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
that
what
congress
did
in
this
case
is
much
more
narrowly
tailored
to
dealing
with--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
indeed,
the
will
in
this
case,
actually
a
number,
maybe
15
or
so
of
the
interests
that
escheated
here
were,
i
think,
escheated
from
someone
who
just
got
them
as
a
result
of
a
residuary
clause
in
the
will
in
this
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--under
some
circumstances,
yes.
all
i
can
say
is
that
there's
dispute
as
to
whether
it
can
be
done...
it
requires
a
majority
of
the
ownership
interests
in
order
to
seek
partition,
or
whether
it
requires
all
the
owners
to
agree
to
partition.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
can
be...
right,
it
can't
be.
that's
right.
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
can
be...
if
an
indian
has
an
ownership
interest
in
a
parcel
of
land
and
seeks
to
take
it
out
of
trust
status,
ordinarily
if
the
person
is
competent
the
secretary
agrees
to
that,
and
then
at
that
point
it
can
be
transferred--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think...
i
believe
there
would
be
authority
even
to
take
it
out
of
trust
status,
take...
to
view
the,
let's
say
a
unanimous
application
by
the
owners,
to
view
that
as
their
request
to
take
it
out
of
trust
status--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
they'd
sell
it
and
then--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
they'd
want
to
sell
it
and
then
it
would
be
partitioned,
but
i
do
think
that
partitioning
as
a
practical
matter
is
not
really
a
solution
to
the
problem,
because
taking
a
parcel
of
land,
especially
with
the
size
of
some
of
these
ownership
interests
involved,
and
trying
to
figure
out
how
fairly
to
divide
it
up
so
the
economic
value
of
what
you're
getting
is
equal
to
your
ownership
interest
is
extraordinary
difficult.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
i
think
the
problem
is
that
it's
very
rarely
the
case
outside
of
the
indian
contexts
where
these
very,
very
small--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
fractions
are
so
small
that
it
gets
to
be
very,
very
cumbersome
to
effectively
partition,
or
even
to...
well,
i
guess
it
could
be
sold,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
you
have--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
reasons
is
because
in
order
to
partition...
i
suppose
one
reason
is
that
it
is
thought
that
you
don't
want
to
just
dispossess
all
of
these
indians
of
their
land
because
perhaps
some
owner
of
a
very
small
interest
doesn't...
wants
to
have
it
partitioned.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
and
also
the
one
other
thing
i'd
add
is
that
this
land
is...
the
administrative
expenses
of
upkeep
of
the
land
are
borne
by
the
united
states,
and
it's
not
subject
to
state
taxes,
and
therefore
you
don't
have
some
of
the
incentives
of
why
owners
of
land
in
a
non-indian
context
that
gets
fractionated
would
want
to
partition
it,
so
you
can
just
deal
with
those
problems.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
suppose
the
only
answer
is
that
because
of...
it
really
goes
to
the
whole
history
of
indian
law
and
all
of
the
purposes
that
are
served
by
holding
the
land
in
trust
and
maintaining
an
indian
land
base
that
is
a
much
more
complex
problem
that
just
saying,
let's
take
the
land
out
of
trust
or
whatever
we
would
have
to
do
and
treat
this
like
any
other
land.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there...
i
suppose
that
there
are
partition
schemes,
there
are
partition
regulations
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
are
currently
applicable
to
this
land
that
allow
partition
in
some
circumstances.
but
i
suppose
the
problem
is
that
the
land,
many,
many
people
have
attachments
to
land,
especially
some
of
the
larger
landowners,
and
they
don't
necessarily
want
their
land
partitioned,
and
it's
important
for
the
government
to
keep
the
land
as
part
of...
it's
not
important
for
the
government,
it's
important
for
the...
for
indian
policy
to
have
the
land
maintained
in
trust
for
the
indians,
and
that
carries
with
it
a
lot
of
other
baggage
that
you
can't
just...
you
can't
just
discard
to
deal
with
this
aspect
of
the
problem.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
