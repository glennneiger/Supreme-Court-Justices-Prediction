what
point
does
this
go
to?
does
it
go
to
the
point
that
if
the
government
only
takes
a
little
bit
of
value
it's
not
a
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
law
that
says
that
a
de
minimis
taking
is
not
a
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
extent
of
the
interest.
it
goes
to
the
value
of
the
land
more
than
the
extent
of
the
interest,
or
at
least
as
much
to
the
value
of
the
land
as
the
extent
of
the
interest,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
could
have
a
pretty
big
chunk
of
an
interest
of
worthless
land
and...
you
know,
worthless
for
anything
except
perhaps
camping
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
admit,
one
has
to
marvel
at
the
prognosticative
ability,
or
else
the
serendipity
of
the
congress,
that
3
years
before
our
opinion
in
hodel
it
should
pass
a
statute
which
happens
to
solve
the
very
things
we
were
troubled
with
in
hodel.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
we
said
in
hodel
that
there
wasn't
enough
of
a
need.
it
seems
to
me
what
we
said
in
hodel
is
simply,
you...
an
essential
part
of
the
bundle
of
property
rights
is
the
ability
to
bequeath
it,
and
if
you
take
that
away,
you've
taken
property,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
i
don't
read
hodel
as
resting
upon
the
total
elimination
of
the
ability
to
devise.
it
just
doesn't
say
that.
it
says...
it
says
the
regulation
here
amounts
to
virtually
the
abrogation
of
the
right
to
pass
on
a
certain
type
of
property,
the
small,
undivided
interest,
to
one
heir...
to
one's
heirs.
not
totally,
virtually.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
does
virtually
that
here,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
unique?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
nuisance
that
congress
created
by...
principally
by
prohibiting
the
indians
from
deeding
this
property.
isn't
that
how
it
all
came
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
weren't
there
severe
limits
on
the
alienation
of
it
by
the
indians?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
congress
gives
this
property
to
the
indians,
puts
these
severe
limitations
on
it
which
creates
this
problem
of
fractionalization,
and
then
comes
in
and
says,
because
of
this
problem
of
fractionalization
which
we've
created,
we're
going
to
take
it
away
from
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying
property
you
don't
care
enough
to
will
it
to
anybody
goes
back
to
the
tribe.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
said
in
hodel,
justice
o'connor's
opinion
said
that
it
may
be
appropriate
to
minimize
further
compounding
by
abolishing
the
descent
of
such
interest
by
rules
of
intestacy.
justice
antonin
scalia
thereby
forcing
the
owners
to
formally
designate
an
heir--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
prevent
escheat.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
solve
a
lot
of
the
problem,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
would
focus
especially
on
these
little
interests
that
are
so
insignificant
that,
you
know,
the
person
doesn't
care
enough--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
even
mention
in
a
will.
justice
antonin
scalia
intestate.
eliminate
intestate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
this
just
seems
to
me
to
say
the
government
has
created
an
economic
wonderland
which
has
caused
this
problem.
the
normal
market
economic
incentives
that
stop
fractionalization
have
been
taken
away
by
the
government,
and
now
the
government
comes
in
with
this
ham-handed
approach
of
simply
solving
the
problem
by
denying
the
right
to
devise,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
couldn't
solve
the
problem
just
as
readily
by
letting
the
normal
incentives
of
the
market
come
back
into
the
picture.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
concede
that?
this
doesn't
apply
to
all
indian
property.
it
only
applies
to
indian
property
that
is
fractionated
the
way
this
is.
the
only
people
who
are
affected
are
those
who
hold
these
small...
these
small
shares.
all
other
indians
can
continue
to
devise
or
dispose
of
through
intestacy
as
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
just
have
a--
--we
wrestled
with
this
whole
thing
10
years
ago.
i
thought
the
issue
before
us
is
a
much
more
narrow
one,
and
that
is
whether,
as
applied
to
the...
this
as-applied
challenge
hodel
governs
or
not.
what
is
it
that
you
say
to
the
government's
contention
that
this
is
different
from
hodel?
it's
a
hard
question
as
an
original
matter,
and
i
remember
agonizing
quite
a
bit
over
the
decision
in
hodel,
but
there
is
the
decision.
it's
on
the
books.
now,
tell
us
why
this
is
the
same
as
hodel
rather
than,
as
the
government
says,
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gather
the
tribes
don't
care.
the
owners
of
the
small,
fractionated
interests
don't
care.
the
only
person
who
cares
is
the
government,
who's
saddled
with
the
enormous
administrative
burden
of
keeping
track
of
all
of
these
fractionated
interests.
is
that
what's
going
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
when
i
say
don't
care,
i
don't
mean
don't
care
about
the
land.
they
don't
care
about
the
fractionating.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
from
a
different
reservation,
or
in
some
cases
different
tribes,
isn't
that
possible?
