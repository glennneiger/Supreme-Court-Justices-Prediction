justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
just
what
happens
in
the...
i
mean,
outside
of
the
indian
law,
isn't
that
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
moreover,
hasn't
that
stopped
the
proliferation
of
these
interests?
in
other
words,
why
can't
you
do
precisely
the
same
thing
in
respect
to
the
small
interests
in
the
indian
territory
that
you
do
in
respect
to
the
small
interests
in
respect
to
non-indian
territory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
give
people
the
right
to
partition,
or
to
ask
for
it,
and
the
person
who
owns
$5
worth
of
land
says,
you
know,
i'll
sell
it
to
him
for
the
$5.
i'm
not
going
to
go
to
court
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
because
we've
had
that
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
thought...
my
point
is
i
thought
that
outside
the
indian
context
we
find
that
we
don't
have
this
problem
because
there
are
these
mechanisms
in
place,
and
so
if
you...
why
couldn't
you,
instead
of
taking
the
thing
away,
just
put
the
same
mechanisms
in
place?
i'm
not
arguing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just...
what
the
reason
is.
what
is
the
reason
why
that
hasn't
happened--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
wouldn't
happen,
or
couldn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
suppose
they
got
that,
and
their
signature
on
that,
it
says,
if
you
check
b,
proceed
to
page
3
and
sign
that,
and
it
happened
on
page
3
and
2
is
all
the
necessary
stuff
for
an
inter
vivos
transfer,
i.e.,
all
the
necessary
stuff
for
a
trust,
and
you
set
up
the
trust,
and
then
at
your
death
it
goes
to
the
beneficiary.
you
know,
all
those
things
were
all
there.
so
they'd
gotten
total
notice,
they'd
gotten
exactly
how
to
do
it,
their
wishes
would
be
carried
out.
it's
not
that
hard
to
work
out.
then
would
this
be
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
why
could
a
state
ever,
for
example,
say
traditional
dower
rights
are,
the
wife
got
one-third
of
a
life
estate
in
the
husband's
property.
we
think
that's
out
of
date,
so
we
pass
a
statute
that
as
to
the
future
the
wife
or
husband
is
to
have
one-half
of
the
property
acquired
during
marriage.
we
make
the
dower
states
the
same
as
the
community
property
states,
into
the
future.
could
that
never
occur--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--giving
everybody
proper
notice,
giving
everybody
plenty
of
chance?
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
i'm
not
asking
this
because
i
have
an
answer.
i'm
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
theory
is
that
underlies
the
unconstitutionality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
you
have
escheat.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--escheat.
and
can
they
never
change
the
escheat
law?
they
say,
we
think
7
years
in
our
state,
gee,
that's
an
awfully
long
time
in
today's
day
and
age.
we
think
you
have
to
notify
the
person
who
has
the
bank
account
that
you
forgot
about
within
6
years,
otherwise
you
lose
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
abandoned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
that's
what
i'm
trying--
--do
any
of
the
tribes
impose
any
kind
of
a
property
tax
on
these
lands,
or
are
they
permitted
to
under
federal
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
a
lot
of...
there
are
statutes
in
different
countries
that...
and
that's
what
i
was...
this
case
differs
from
the
last
case
in
that
here
there
is
a
set
of
people
whom
you
can
leave
the
property
to
and
a
set
to
whom
you
cannot
leave
it
to.
that's
the
difference,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
land
law,
i
think,
property
law
in
different
countries
that
do
things
like
that.
they
say,
you
can
leave...
you
cannot
leave
this
land,
or
you
cannot
leave
this
part
of
your
estate
to
anyone
but
your
first
child,
or
to
anyone
but
the
children.
they
already
have
an
interest
in
it.
or
you
have
to
leave
a
certain
amount
to
your
wife,
or
you
have...
those
are
traditional,
and
that's
why
i
was
trying
to
see,
is
there
anything
in
those
cases
that...
suppose
we
wanted
to
move
towards
some
of
those
kinds
of
rules.
i
don't
know
that
any
state
would
or
wouldn't,
but
this
sounds
a
little
bit
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
here
they
say,
you
see
the
tribe
is
like
your
family.
we're
doing
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
and
that's
also
true
if
you
don't
like
your
children.
[laughter]
i
suppose
if
the
forced
heir
was
the
nation
of
france,
that
might
be
a
different
question.
some
of
these
indians
whose
property
would
escheat
to
the
tribe
are
from,
in
fact,
different
segments
of
the
tribe,
aren't
they,
that
are
not
on
that
reservation?
