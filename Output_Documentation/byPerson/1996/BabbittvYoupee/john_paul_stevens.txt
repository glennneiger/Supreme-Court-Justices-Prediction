mr.
feldman,
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
basic
question?
supposing
congress
gave
plenty
of
notice
to
the
indians...
you
know,
i
suggested
that
in
the
hodel
case...
say
that
20,
a
statute
to
take
effect
20
years
after
its
date,
say,
no
indian
property
may
be
passed
by...
at
death
to
heir...
to
anybody.
just,
period.
it
will
all
escheat
to
the
tribe.
would
that
violate
the
takings
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just,
all
property
owned
by
any
member
of
the
tribe
shall
escheat
to
the
tribe
at
death,
but
would
not
interfere
with
the
owner's
right
to
dispose
of
it
inter
vivos
at
any
time
during
the
20
years.
would
that
violate
the
takings--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
modify
my
hypothetical?
suppose
instead
of
prohibiting
both
devise
and
intestacy,
it
simply
prohibited
intestacy.
no
property
of
any
indian
shall
pass
by
reason
of
intestacy,
but
all...
if
there's
no
will
the
property
will
all
escheat
to
the
state...
to
the
tribe,
rather.
do
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
intending
to
consolidate
property
interests
that
are
small
and
fractionated
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
seems
to
me
if
you
haven't
gone
that
far,
really...
if
you
said
that
was
okay,
i
don't
know
why
you
can't
say
we're
going
to
insist
on
inter
vivos
action
in
order
to
protect
the
value
and
the
interest.
i'm
making
you
argue
the
wrong
side
of
the
case,
i
guess.
i
shouldn't
do
this.
[laughter]
but
if
you're
going
to
abolish
intestacy,
i
don't
know
why...
and
say
you've
got
to
show
sufficient
interest
in
the
property
to
identify
it
in
your
last
will
and
testament.
i
don't
know
why
you
couldn't
similarly...
if
the
property
owner
has
plenty
of
notice,
plenty
of
time
to
prepare
his
or
her
affairs,
say
you
must
dispose
of
it
inter
vivos
in
order
to
preserve
the
value,
and
then
you
can
leave
the
cash
to
somebody
else,
because
there
is
a
national
interest
in
getting
rid
of
these
fractionated
interests.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
he
did
consult
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
drafting
the
will?
they
did
it...
isn't
that
true,
that
these
owners
do
rely
on
the
bureau
for
assistance
in
their
legal
affairs
and
dealing
with
their
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
explanation
of
that
in
the
record,
is
there,
why
they
wouldn't
have
been
advised
that
the
devises
didn't
comply
with
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
suppose
they
had
passed...
suppose
the
system
were
totally
different,
the
administrative
system,
and
what
had
happened
is,
every
person
who
has
one
of
these
interests
got
a
big
piece
of
paper.
in
big
letters
it
said,
you
own
a
small
interest.
check
the
box
below.
box
1,
at
my
death
i
would
like
it
to
go
to
the
tribe.
b,
at
my
death
i
would
like
it
to
go
to,
fill
in
the
blank,
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
does
apply
to
the
entire
indian
population,
and
all
indian
lands
where
there
is
an
interest
that
is
undivided
and
it
meets
the
statutory
formula.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you...
it's
not
a
class
action,
or
it's
not
an
industry-wide
piece
of
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
refresh
my
recollection
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
the
decedent
had
several
children.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the
will
were
given
effect,
you
would
have
further
fractionalization,
then,
wouldn't
you?
each
would
get
an
undivided
tenth
of
what
he
had.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't...
would
you
give
me
a
little
more
detail?
explain
how
that
could
be,
if
he
had
10
children
and
the
will
just...
was
it...
did
he
give
a
partial
to
each
of
the
10?
is
that
what
he
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
so
there's
one
devise
to
the
one
child
that's
at
stake
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
each
in
a
separate
parcel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
okay.
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
guess
that
means
that
a
number
of
applications
of
this
very
statute
would
be
permissible,
although
the
one
involving
your
clients
would
not
be,
because
this
statute
will
prevent
that.
it
prevents
further
fractionalization,
as
i
understand
it.
