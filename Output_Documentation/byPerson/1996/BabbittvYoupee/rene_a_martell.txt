mr.
rene
a.
martell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
here
today
to
discuss
the
effects
of
the
amendments
on
the
hodel
decision.
mr.
youpee
left
34
parcels
to
six
of
his
children,
and
he
left
them
in
such
a
fashion
that
each
child
would
be
sole
owner
of
the
parcel
that
he
left.
he
pretty
much
is
now
put
in
the
position
that
the
plaintiffs
were
in
the
hodel
decision.
the
amended
act
does
not
cure
the
problems
pointed
out
by
the
court
in
the
hodel
decision,
and
it
wasn't
until
1992
that
this...
congress
decided
to
have,
again,
hearings
on
the
fractionalization
problem,
and
in
1994
the
secretary
distributed
for
comment
new
amendments
that
had...
the
heart
of
it,
of
which
was
a
revolving
money
fund
to
pay
for
these
interests.
one
of
the
problems
that
remains
with
the
amendments
now
is
that
the
amendments
still
try
to
categorize
the
land
as
de
minimis
by
considering
only
the
income
that
they
generate,
whereas
the
court
in
hodel
say
the
proper
determination
is
the
land's
actual
economic
value.
the
economic
value
here
is
that
$2,100
of
these...
is
what
these
parcels
are
worth.
that's
a
significant
sum
of
money,
and
it's
significant
in
roosevelt
county,
which
is
one
of
the
poorest
counties
in
montana.
mr.
youpee's
property
interests,
if
they
were
partitioned,
in
10
of
those
parcels
those
interests
would
be
between
2
and
6
acres,
so
as
the
court
has
said--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--when
i
divided
his...
the
acreage
by
his
interest,
in
one
parcel
it
was
6
acres,
in
four
other
parcels,
those
were
4-acre
tracts,
and
in
three
other
parcels
those
tracts
were
in
excess
of
2
acres,
so
a
taking
even
of
small
land
is
still
a
taking.
under
the
amendments,
at
25
u.s.c.
2206(c),
it
appears
that
if
the
tribe
wants
to
have
a
consolidation
program
and
pay...
and...
excuse
me,
a
consolidation
program
and
have...
add
within
their
code
how
they're
going
to
treat
descent
and
distribution,
and
that
code
disenfranchises
nonmember
indians
and
non-indians,
that
they
have
to
pay
fair
market
value
for
those
interests
that
they
get
as
a
tribe.
the
second
problem
here
is
that
the
option
of
inter
vivos
transfers
do
not
cure
the
taking.
mr.
youpee
has
virtually
no
opportunity
to
leave
his
land
to
his
children.
it
is
only
through
a
devise
of
his
land
that
he
would
be
able
to,
and
that's
only
if
his
children
are
already
owners.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
he
wasn't
dependent
on
income.
it's
just
such
a
headache
to
do
it,
and
to
know--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--well,
it's
a
tremendous
bureaucratic
process.
i
mean,
if
he
was
to
try
to
transfer
his
land
in
his
lifetime,
it
involves
the
approval
of
the
local
agency--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--the
third--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--correct,
your
honor.
in
1981
he
went
to
the
regional,
the
area
office
in
billings,
away
from
the
reservation,
and
had
the
chief
realty
officer
draw
up
his
will,
and
it
was
retained
there,
and
at
no
time
after
1981
was
he
ever
told
that
his
devises
would
be
ineffective.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
no.
it's
just
a
reality.
nobody
knows
about
this
law,
and
nobody
is
told
about
this
law.
it's
just
not
happening.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
right.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
due
process
problem,
but
i
think
there
would
still
be
a
problem
in
that
the
land
is
not
compensated.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
i--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--i
think
the
theory
is,
is
that
he's
being
forced
to
forfeit
his
land
to
the
tribes.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
right.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
i
think
there
wouldn't
be
abandonment
if
there
was
an
opportunity,
if
there
was
a
process,
you
knew
about
the
process,
and
you
chose
not
to
do
it.
then
perhaps
the
property
would
be
abandoned.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
but
that's...
people
here
don't
about
the
process.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honors.
some
tribes
do
have
consolidation
programs,
but--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--correct,
your
honor,
and
i...
you
know,
i
would
maintain
that
that's
pretty
much
the
essence
of
it,
because
indians
take...
took
this
property
under
the
allotment
act
with
the
understanding
that
they
would
have
these
rights
to--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
right.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
right.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
okay.
it's
the
same
as
hodel
because
mr.
youpee
has
no
options.
i
mean,
his
option,
his
complex...
during
his
lifetime
a...
you
know,
a
series
of
complex
transfers,
and
the
court
in
hodel
said
that's...
you
know,
that's
not
a
substitute
for
the
rights
that's
taken.
his
right
that
is
taken
is,
he
can't...
his
land
cannot
descend,
and
he
cannot
leave
it
to
his
children,
because
devise
has
to
be
limited
to
a
coowner,
and
a
reality
is,
as
was
pointed
out
before,
children
don't
inherit
land
at
the
same
time
their
parents
do.
most
indians,
when
they
receive
land,
receive
it
through
inheritance,
but
most
kids
do
not.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
no,
your
honor.
anything
that
tribes
have
done
that
consolidate,
have
consolidation
programs
were
before
these
amendments.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
i
think
that
the
tribes
strategically
don't
care
because
they
get
the
land
by
not
making
an
effort.
if
they
don't
pass
a
consolidation
program
they
still
get
the
land,
but
i
think
the
people
care
about
the
land.
that's
kind
of
why
we're
here.
i
mean,
mr.
youpee
wanted
his
children
to
have
the
land
of
his
ancestors,
and
they
wanted
that
land,
and
so--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--they
care
about
it,
but
there's
such
an
overwhelming
bureaucracy
there
that
it's
hard
to
make
headway
into
it.
i
mean,
it...
i
mean,
it
would
be
hard
to
make
headway
into
34
parcels
if
the
people
that
you
were
talking
to
weren't
receptive
to
doing
it,
and
that's
the
reality
of
it.
i
mean,
they
don't
want
to
spend
the
time
to
help
you
do
a
gift
deed
34
times,
or
let
you
know
that
perhaps
you
should
do
that.
we
have
considered
in
our
argument
that
under
the
amendments
there
is
still
a
problem,
as...
exactly
as
there
was
in
hodel,
that
for
indians
under
18
and
those
incompetent,
that
they...
they're
totally
just...
are
just
like
the
plaintiffs
in
hodel,
is
that
devise
and
descent
are
totally
abrogated
for
them.
we
feel
that
the
escheat
provision
is
in
fact
a
categorical
taking,
because
as
i
mentioned,
mr.
youpee
has
no
options.
i
mean,
in
the...
the
operative
provisions
of
the
amendments
leave
him
no
choice.
he
could...
you
know,
he
could
leave
it
to
a
coowner,
but
that
will
not
be
his
children,
and
he
could
do
inter
vivos
transfers,
but
that's...
as
the
court
said,
that's
not
an
effective
substitute
for
losing
the
right
of
devise
and
descent,
so
in
effect
his
land
is
transferred
to
a
tribe
without
his
consent.
we
feel
as
a
regulation
that...
if
you
consider
these
amendments
a
regulation,
that
they
go
too
far,
again.
i
mean,
the
stated
government
purpose
is
to
stop
the
fractionization
of
indian
land,
but
the
underlying
purpose
that
comes
out
time
and
again
in
the
legislative
history
is
that
the
government
wants
to
save
money,
and
saving
money
has
never
been
a
sufficient
reason
to
allow
a
taking,
and
there's
no
average
reciprocity
of
advantage
here.
i
mean,
there's
no
public
benefit
to
mr.
youpee
for
his
children
if
the
tribes
obtain
his
land
interests.
mr.
youpee's
right
of
descent
is
a
vested
right,
and
compensation
should
be
paid
for
that
right
if
it
is
taken.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
i
think
it
would
your
honor,
because
his
land
would
not
be
taken
from
him,
and
that's
in
fact
what
he
did,
so--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--i
think
it
would
be
permissible,
because
you'd
still
have
the
identifiable
property
interest.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
he
had
10
children,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
if
the
will
was
allowed
to
go
through,
each
of
his
children
would
only
take
one
interest.
his
land
was
not
fractionated
under
his
will.
i
mean,
if
there
was
a
royalty
check
coming,
instead
of
coming
to
him
it
would
go
to
one
child.
the
next
parcel,
it
might
go
to
another
child,
but
it
wouldn't
go
to
two
children.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
correct.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
i
guess
i've
confused
it
by
saying
he
had
10
children.
his
other
children
were
taken
care
of
through
other
devises.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
there's
six
children
here,
but
each
of
them
had
a
specific
devise
that
gave
them--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--correct.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
sorry
to
be
unclear.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
correct.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
i
don't
think
they
can
prohibit
it
unless
they
pay
for
it.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
that's--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
okay.
i
guess
i--
mr.
rene
a.
martell
--i
guess
i
was
confused.
i
mean,
it
seems
that
as
long
as
he
doesn't
lose
his
land,
that
that
would
be
a
legitimate
way
to
do
it.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
but
i
would
think
it...
i
guess
i'm
getting
confused.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it
would
ever
be...
you
know,
if
you're
taking
somebody's
land
and
not
paying
for
it,
then
it's
not
permissible.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
right.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
it
seems
like
most
of
the
state
laws
that
deal
with...
you
know,
with
forced
heirs
like
that
are
doing
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
family.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
but
not
for
the
benefit
of
mr.
youpee's.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
correct.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
right,
your
honor.
there's
three
reservations
involved.
we
would
argue
that
mr.
youpee's
right
of
descent
is
vested
because
this
is
an
indian
law
case,
and
his
right
of
descent
was
in...
was
part
of
the
bundled
rights
that
was
understood
to
be
taken
to
the
general
allotment
act,
so
the
general
allotment
act
had
as
its
purpose
to
start
the
americanization
of
indians,
and
therefore
the
right
to
be...
of
descent
was
a
vested
traditional
property
right
that
the
indians
understood
they
had
when
they
took
the
land.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
it's
a...
within
exterior
boundaries
it's
a
million
acres.
the
tribal
and
the
indian
ownership
is
about
51
percent,
and
there's
about
5,000
people,
5,000
indians.
mr.
rene
a.
martell
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
i've
nothing
further,
your
honor.
