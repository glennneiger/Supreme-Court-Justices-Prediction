we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1595,
bruce
babbitt
v.
marvin
k.
youpee,
sr.--
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you're
talking
about
collateral
heirs,
a
quite
distant
relationship
if
you
get
to
the
third
or
fourth
generation,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
great
many
wills
don't
simply
set
out
parcels
of
property
and
do
nothing
else.
they'll
devise
the
residuary
estate,
everything
else
i
have,
which
would
pick
up
these
fractional
interests,
so
wills
wouldn't
necessarily
pick
out
this
property.
the
person
who
writes
the
will
may
have
no
more
idea
that
he
has
the
interest
than
the
person
who
lets
it
go
by
intestate
succession.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
one
thing,
too,
for
an
owner,
say,
of
three-quarters
of
a
tract
to
buy
out
fractions
from
the
other
quarter,
but
for
someone
with
3/100ths
interest
to
start
a
partition
proceeding,
you
have
quite
different
incentives.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
martell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
two
and
6
acres
in
each
parcel,
or
total?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
that
be,
mr.
martell?
i
would
think
that
if
he
knows
who
he
might
devise
it
to,
which
among
his
children,
he
might
also
make
an
inter
vivos
transfer
to
those
children,
unless
he's
dependent
upon
income
from
the
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
it's
every...
it's
no
bigger
a
headache
to
devise
it
inter...
or
to
grant
it
inter
vivos
than
to
leave
it
by
will,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
would
have
to
go
through
it
if
he
did
it
in
his
lifetime.
his
children
would
have
to
go
through
it
if
he
did
it
by
will.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
has
a
great
deal
of
authority
under
the
constitution
over
the
affairs
of
the
indian
tribes.
i
don't
think
the
federal
government
could
step
in
and
prescribe
a
general
partition
statute
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
laws
of
all
of
the
50
states,
but
it
does
have
special
authority
to
deal
with
indian
property,
and
certainly
that's
what
it's
attempted
to
do
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
we
should
just
talk
to
each
other.
[laughter]
i
mean,
anyway,
you
can
say
that
in
this
case
he
didn't
get
enough
notice.
they
didn't
send
him
the
paper.
it
was
passed
only
a
few
years
before
he
died.
it
wasn't
for
the
future,
and
so
from
your
point
of
view
i
guess
this
is
somewhat
irrelevant,
the
debate
of
what
would
happen
under
other
circumstances.
well,
but
it's...
but
is
it
not
true
that
what
we
have
at
issue
in
this
case
is
your
particular
client's
claim?
we
aren't
necessarily
deciding
that
the
statute
would
be
valid
or
invalid
as
to
a
host
of
other
applications,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
government
were
to
put
in
some
sort
of
a
unitization
program
like
the
states
have
put
in
a
lot
of
oilfields,
where
the
thing
is
consolidated
into
certain
minimum
tracts
and
you
get
a
percentage
from
that,
but
you
don't
have
the
right
to
deal
on
your
own
with
it
any
more.
would
that
be
permissible,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
large
an
area
is
the
fort
peck
reservation,
and
how
many
of
the
tribe
reside
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
it's
a
family,
it's
a
rather
large
family.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martell.
the
case
is
submitted.
