what
about
timber?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
that's...
i
asked...
you
said
it's
mostly
grazing
and
mineral.
does
the
record
support
that,
and
not
timber,
because
one
of
my
concerns
along
the
lines
of
justice
o'connor's
questioning
under
this
statute
is
that
timber
harvesting
typically
is...
oh,
some
parts
of
california
at
least
once
every
15
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
could
be
very
valuable
in
that
one
year.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
any
of
the
indian
lands
in
question
here
ever
subject
to
partition?
suppose
three
or
four
owners
are
in
a
real
dispute
over
what
to
do
with
the
land,
do
they
have
a
remedy
of
partition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
it
does,
i
suppose
that
only
certain
authorized
persons
at
the
sale,
because
it
can't
be
devised
to
a
non-indian.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
transferred
to
a
non-indian.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
who
would
be
the
bidder
at
the
partition
sale,
if
there
are
limited...
if
there
are
a
limited
number
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--qualified
owners?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
it
wouldn't
be
partitioned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it's
unanimous,
you
don't
need
partition.
