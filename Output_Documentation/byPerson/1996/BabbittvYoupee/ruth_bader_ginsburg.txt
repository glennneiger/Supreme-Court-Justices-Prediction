with
respect
to
that,
mr.
feldman,
i
was
trying
to
think
of
any
other
kind
of
regulation
by
the
sovereign
of
the
right
to
dispose
of
property
on
death
that
would
be
comparable
to
this,
and
you
rely
on
the
large
power
of
the
sovereign
to
regulate
the
disposition
of
property
on
death,
and
here
the
regulation
says
most
lineal
descendants
will
not
qualify.
i
couldn't
think
of
anything
that
would
be
close
to
this.
is
there
any...
you
talk
about
a
larger
authority,
but
is
there
anything
that
so
severely
restricts
the
category
of
potential
devisees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
most
of
them
come
up
as
except...
in
the
main,
you
can
devise
your
property,
but
there
are
these
exceptions,
and
here
is
in
the
main
you
can't,
unless
you
come
under
the
exception
of
somebody
who
already
has
a
share
of
that
same
parcel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
mr.
feldman,
isn't
that
a...
i
know
you
asked
us
to
say,
at
least
with
respect
to
descent
or
further
fractionalizing
a
share
by
devise,
but
those
people
are
not
before
this
court,
and
we
do
have
these
people
who
were
devised
shares
that
were
not
reduced
further
by
the
devise.
we
can
decide
that
case.
but
isn't
there
something
about
procedural
due
process
that
would
inhibit
us
from
deciding
the
cases
of
people
who
have
not
been
given
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
that
their
cases
are
going
to
be
affected
by
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
could
be
left
open,
but
i
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
martell,
what
about
the
first
difference?
the
government
didn't
bring
it
up
at
argument,
but
on
the
brief
they
said
that
the
1984
change
had
three
things
in
it
that
weren't
there
before,
and
one
of
them
had
to
do
with
authorizing
tribes
to
adopt
laws
that
would
govern
dispositions
of
escheatable
interests.
have
there
been,
to
your
knowledge,
any
such
tribal
codes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
significant
change
turns
out
still
to
be
undeveloped
and
unused.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would
you
contest...
suppose
all...
the
only
limit
was,
you
can
give
away
what
you
have,
but
you
can't
divide
it
up
into
further
hands.
so
you've
got
this
one
piece.
you
can
give
it
to
one
person,
but
you
can't
give
it
to
three
people.
would
that
be
constitutional,
to
put
that
restriction
on
the
ability
to
devise?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
martell,
i'm
surprised,
because
i
thought
you
told
me
that
you
thought
it
would
be
a
legitimate
restriction
for
the
government
to
say
to
mr.
youpee
or
anyone
else,
you
can
give
each
parcel
that
you
have
to
one
person,
or
to
that
many
different
people
as
you
have
parcels,
but
you
cannot
take
that
one
parcel
and
turn
that
parcel
into
two.
i
thought
in
answer
to
my
question
you
said,
that's
right,
that
would
be
the
kind
of
restriction
that
we
wouldn't
attack
as
a
taking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you
seemed
to
give
a
different
response
to
justice
o'connor.
i
thought
you
accepted
that
you
can
freeze
the
size
of
the
parcel
as
they
now
are.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
no
further
division,
and
that
would
be
okay.
