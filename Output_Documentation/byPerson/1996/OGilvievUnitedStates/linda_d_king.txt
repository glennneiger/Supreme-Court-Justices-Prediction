ms.
linda
d.
king
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1918,
congress
created
an
exception
to
taxation
for
the
traditional
tort
victim.
when
asked
to
extend
this
same
exception
to
the
hybrid
statutory
victim
this
court
in
burke
and
schleier
determined
that
the
exception
was
not
to
be
extended.
the
enactors
in
1918
did
not
know
about
the
hybrid
statutory
rights,
statutory
remedies
for
age
and
gender
discrimination
that
would
be
created
in
federal
statute
some
50
years
later.
those
congressmen
in
1918
wrote
the
statute
for
what
they
understood
and
what
is
before
the
court
today,
the
common
law
tort
claim.
this
court
has
never
before
been
asked
to
apply
this
statute
to
common
law
tort
claims.
instead,
the
recent
cases
of
burke
and
schleier
have
asked
this
court
to
apply
the
exclusion
to
the
hybrid
federal
statute
with
legislated
remedies.
those
remedies
are
based
primarily
on
lost
wages.
because
the
original
statute
allows
only
the
exclusion
for
tort
or
tort-like
claims,
and
because
the
hybrid
statutes
provided
for
contract-like
recoveries,
this
court
in
burke
determined
that
there
was
no
tort-like
claim.
in
burke,
the
court
tested
the
type
of
claim
by
a
review
of
the
type
of
damages
that
could
be
awarded
under
the
federal
statute
to
determine
that
the
claim
was
not
tort-like
but
instead
more
in
the
nature
of
a
contract
claim,
a
contract
for
wages.
in
schleier,
the
court
was
once
again
asked
to
name
the
type
of
claim,
and
again
resorted
to
the
analysis
of
the
type
of
damages
to
do
that.
a
claim
is
known
by
the
type
of
damages
it
produces
in
these
hybrid
federal
statutes.
the
matter
that
is
before
you
today
is
not--
ms.
linda
d.
king
--it's
my
understanding
that
it
was,
your
honor.
the
matter
that
is
before
you
today
is
not
the
hybrid
statute
in
which
you
must
determine
the
type
of
claim.
it's
the
wrongful
death
of
mrs.
o'gilvie,
the
classic
and
quintessential
tort
claim,
and
precisely
the
type
of
tort
claim
contemplated
by
the
1918
congress
when
writing
the
statute.
now,
when
the
statute
was
divided
in
1954
into
the
numerous
clauses
that
you've
already
discussed,
section
104(a)(2)
was
cut
apart
from
its
first
clause,
from
its
context,
if
you
will,
and
the
potential
for
reading
this
statute
in
two
separate
ways
was
created.
the
entire
sentence
in
section
104(a)(2)
has
two
separate
and
distinct
meanings
that
each
seem
plain.
this
is
a
rare
and
unusual
type
of
ambiguity,
a
patent
structural
ambiguity,
one
we
seldom
encounter
in
the
english
language.
before
schleier,
every
court
which
had
found
the
statute
plain
had
found
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
the
test
of
ambiguity
is
whether
reasonable
persons
disagree
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
words.
it
is
apparent
that
section
104(a)(2),
out
of
its
context,
out
of
its
original
context,
is
ambiguous.
one
third
of
this
court
was
struggling
with
the
issue
of
whether
the
court...
excuse
me,
the
statute
was
ambiguous
or
not.
seven
federal
circuit
court
panels
have
found
this
statute
to
be
ambiguous,
including
the
tenth
circuit
in
o'gilvie
here,
after
this
court's
decision
in
schleier.
if
we
may
presume
that
justices
and
judges
are
reasonable
persons,
the
test
of
ambiguity
is
surely
met.
ms.
linda
d.
king
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
not
go
that
far
as
to
say
that.
ms.
linda
d.
king
again,
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that.
i
am
merely--
ms.
linda
d.
king
--no,
my
position
is
that
it
is,
ambiguous
out
of
context
of
the
original
steps.
ms.
linda
d.
king
each
of
those
circuits
determined
that
it
first
was
ambiguous,
and
then
read
it
in
a
very
tunnel
vision
fashion,
only
the
language
of
the
current
statute,
section
104(a)(2)
as
written.
the
two
distinct
tests
that
have
been
found
in
the
language
are,
what
is
the
underlying
claim,
and
the
second
test
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
underlying
damages.
ms.
linda
d.
king
yes.
ms.
linda
d.
king
the
very
nature
of
a
patent
structural
ambiguity
is
that
it
has
two
distinct,
clear,
and
mutually
exclusive
meanings.
the
courts
have
examined
this
statute
in
a
tunnel
vision
manner,
and
looked
either
at
one
or
the
other
of
the
interpretations.
the
type
of
ambiguity
that
we
have
here
is
resolved
only
by
context
here
the
original
statute.
upon
a
finding
of
ambiguity,
the
courts
are
not
relieved
of
the
duty
to
examine
reliable
evidence
to
determine
congressional
intent
to
exclude.
the
only
question
here
that
must
be
answered
is
which
of
the
two
tests
did
the
original
statute
meet?
proper
construction
and
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
statute
has
a
mandatory
hierarchy
of
evidence,
and
the
relative
weight
of
each
element
primarily
is
nondiscretionary.
the
most
reliable
evidence
that
we
have
of
the
intent
of
the
enacting
congress
is
in
the
words
of
the
original
statute
itself...
there
is
not
a
default
rule...
that
upon
a
finding
of
facial
ambiguity
that
there
is
a
finding
also
in
favor
of
the
government.
this
court
has
never
applied
a
default
rule
either
in
schleier
or
burke.
the
requirement
is
a
diligent
search
of
all
reliable
evidence
for
the
clear
intent
to
exclude,
whether
found
in
the
words
of
the
current
statute,
the
words
of
the
original
statute,
or
other
reliable
evidence.
ms.
linda
d.
king
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
original--
ms.
linda
d.
king
--my
argument
is
that
in
the
face
of
an
ambiguity,
that
you
need
to
look
to
the
intent
of
congress
before
you
decide
in
favor
of
the
government,
and
if
there
is
clear
and
reliable
evidence...
clear
and
reliable
evidence...
that
there
was
an
intent
to
exclude,
that
should
control
before
a
default
rule.
ms.
linda
d.
king
i'm
sorry.
[laughter]
ms.
linda
d.
king
well--
ms.
linda
d.
king
--yes.
taken
as
a
whole,
if
this
is
a
holistic
endeavor
and
we
look
at
the
history
of
the
words
written
by
congress,
even
after
divided
in
1954,
then
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
but
section
104(a)(2)
read
out
of
its
context
has
shown
an
ambiguity
that
each
court
that's
dealt
with
it
has
struggled
with
mightily.
ms.
linda
d.
king
i
think
the
words
taken
out
of
context,
a
short
phrase
taken
out
of
the
context
of
its
original
statute
are
ambiguous
without
its
context.
ms.
linda
d.
king
the
appellate
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
have
given
no
regard
to
the
original
statute.
ms.
linda
d.
king
i
say
they
were
wrong.
ms.
linda
d.
king
yes.
ms.
linda
d.
king
that's...
out
of
context,
it
doesn't
count.
it
is
plain
if
you
take
the
entire
statute
read
as
a
whole.
and
finally,
the
original
statute
was
plain
on
its
face,
in
context.
the
clear
distinction
between
compensation
for
personal
injury
and
the
amount
of
any
damages
is
the
clear
comparison
in
the
original
statute.
congress
did
not
intend
an
allocation--
ms.
linda
d.
king
--thank
you.
