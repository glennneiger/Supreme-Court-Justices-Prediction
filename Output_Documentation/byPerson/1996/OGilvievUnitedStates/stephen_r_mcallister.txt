mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
minor
children
of
the
decedent
in
the
wrongful
death
suit
underlying
this
case
have
raised
before
this
court
two
independent
and
potentially
dispositive
legal
issues.
the
first
is
whether
the
punitive
damages
that
the
children
received
in
connection
with
the
death
of
their
mother
are
excludable
from
gross
income
as
any
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
the
statute
on
its
face
does
not
contemplate
a
distinction
between
punitive
and
compensatory
damages.
the
statute
says
any
damages,
a
word
that
the
united
states
frequently
does
not
include
in
its
quotations
of
the
statute
in
its
brief
in
this
court.
certainly,
there
was
a
longstanding...
has
been
a
longstanding
understanding
in
tort
law
that
there
is
a
difference
between
punitive
and
compensatory
damages,
and
this
court
has
often
stated
that
congress
is
presumed
to
have
known
the
state
of
the
common
law
when
it
enacts
statutes.
congress
easily
could
have
said
only
compensatory
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries
should
be
excluded,
but
it
did
not
do
so.
it
said,
any
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries
should
be
excluded.
in
fact,
when
congress
has
wanted
to
draw
a
distinction
between
punitive
and
compensatory
damages
it
has
expressly
done
so,
for
example,
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
in
which
congress
precluded
liability
of
the
united
states
for
punitive
damages
arising
from
the
tortious
conduct
of
its
employees
and,
indeed,
the
irs
itself
has
at
times
read
this
statute
in
precisely
the
way
we
contend
it
should
be
read,
to
exclude
any
and
all
damages
that
are
recovered
in
connection
with
a
personal
injury
suit.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that
is
certainly
the
government's
contention,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
that's
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
if
you
look
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute
as
originally
enacted
in
1918,
the
substance
of
it
has
not
changed,
but
the
organization
and
the
order
has
changed
to
some
extent.
the
original
provision
in
1918
basically
excluded
accident
or
health
insurance
benefits
or
worker's
comp
benefits
which
the
sentence
then
said,
received
as
compensation
for
personal
injuries,
plus
any
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries
whether
by
suit
or
agreement,
so
that
the
statute
itself,
when
you
look
at
how
it
was
originally
enacted,
it
was
a
very
odd
way
that
congress
intended
all
of
those
things
to
be
limited
to
compensation,
to
list
certain
things
followed
by
the
phrase,
received
as
compensation
for
personal
injuries,
and
then
to
go
on
and
say,
plus
any
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
furthermore,
when
this
court
talked
about
the
on
account
of
language
in
its
decision
in
schleier
recently
the
court
talked
about
whether
the
damages
were
attributable
to
an
underlying
personal
injury,
or
whether
the
underlying
personal
injury
affected
the
amount.
the
court
concluded
that
liquidated
damages
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
did
not
satisfy
either
of
those
conditions,
but
punitive
damages
are
different.
punitive
damages
do
satisfy
those
conditions
in
a
couple
of
ways.
first
of
all,
as
this
court
recognized
recently
in
bmw
v.
gore,
punitive
damages
both
the
availability
and
the
appropriate
amount
in
most
jurisdictions
depends
on
considerations
of
the
underlying
harm,
the
nature
of
the
harm,
the
extent
of
the
harm.
gore
recognizes
as
much
when
it
talks
about
the
first
factor,
for
example,
the
reprehensibility
of
the
conduct,
talks
about
personal
injury
is
more
egregious
than
property
damage,
a
physical
injury
in
essence
is
more
serious
than
perhaps
a
dignitary
injury,
and
most
jurisdictions,
if
not
all,
recognize
those
concepts
as
far
as
punitive
damages
are
concerned
in
determining
whether
they're
appropriate
and
then
what
amount
is
necessary.
furthermore,
it's
the
rule
in
virtually
all
jurisdictions,
again,
if
not
all,
and
the
traditional
rule
is
that
there
can
be
no
award
of
punitive
damages
in
the
absence
of
proof
of
actual
harm
and
generally
in
the
absence
of
proof
of
actual
damages,
that
there
needs
to
be
an
actual
compensatory
award
made
before
punitive
damages
are
allowed
at
all,
and
for
those
reasons,
even
within
the
attributable-to
language
and
the
affecting
the
amount
language
that
this
court
endorsed
in
schleier,
the
punitive
damages
in
this
case
satisfy
that
test
in
a
way
that
the
liquidated
damages
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
did
not.
furthermore,
punitive
damages,
as
we've
suggested,
do
sometimes
serve
compensatory
purposes,
so
even
if
the
court
is
to
view
it
in
that
fashion,
historically
that
was
clearly
the
case.
we've
cited
the
black's
law
dictionary
from
the
time
period
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
which
clearly
contemplates
that
in
some
situations
they
serve
a
compensatory
purpose.
but
even
more
recently,
in
the
1996
amendment
to
this
statute
congress
recognized
that
sometimes
what
the
states
call
punitive
damages
may,
in
fact,
serve
compensatory
purposes,
and
that
recognition
is
in
the
new
section
104(c),
in
which
congress
has
said
in
the
new
104(a)(2)
punitive
damages
are
no
longer
excluded,
except,
it
says
in
subsection
(c),
in
a
wrongful
death
suit
where
only
punitive
damages
are
allowed,
and
the
jurisdiction
of
which
i'm
aware
is
alabama.
there
may
be
a
couple
of
others.
congress
has
said
in
that
circumstance
those
punitive
damages
are
excluded,
apparently
because--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--there's
an
'89
amendment,
your
honor,
which
altered
the
scope
of
the
original.
the
1996
amendment
does
not
appear
in
any
of
the
original
briefs
because
it
was
passed
by
congress
in
august
and
signed
by
the
president
in
august,
after
the
briefing
had
been
completed.
part
of
the
text
is
included
in
the
supplemental
briefs.
i
don't
know
if
104(c)
is
actually
included
in
the
supplemental
briefs,
but
that
text
was
all
extremely
recent
and
after
the
merits
briefing
was
basically
completed
in
this
case.
the
1989
amendment
is
discussed
in
the
briefs.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
it's
certainly
not,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
resolving
the
statutory
interpretation
issue
present
here.
all
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
in
the
1996
amendment
congress
itself
is
recognizing
that
sometimes
punitive
damages
may
serve
compensatory
purposes.
the
example
it
recognized
is
the
alabama
situation,
where
in
a
wrongful
death
suit
all
the
plaintiff
is
allowed
to
recover,
the
only
thing
is
punitive
damages
and
congress
said,
even
though
those
are
labeled
punitive
damages
by
the
state
of
alabama,
we
want
them
to
be
excludable
under
section
104.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
the
'89
amendment
was
prospective,
but
it's
important,
because
what
the
'89
amendment
does,
it
can
be
read
two
ways,
but
what
the
lower
courts
have
strongly
endorsed
is
the
view
that
what
congress
understood
at
the
time
was
that
all
punitive
damages
as
of
1989
were
excludable
under
section
104.
there
was
a
debate
between
the
house
and
the
senate
as
to
how
they
might
narrow
the
scope
of
that.
what
they
ultimately
ended
up
with
was
a
provision
that
says
the
exclusion
shall
not
apply
in
any
case
not
involving
physical
injury
or
physical
sickness,
and
that
narrowed
the
scope,
but
it
remained
the
case
that
punitive
damages
received
in
a
physical
injury
case
are
excludable
and
in
fact
the
house--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
and
certainly
most
of
the
cases
come
after
the
1989
amendment,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
lower
courts
have,
when
they've
decided
these
cases,
looked
at
that
amendment
and
said,
what--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--you're
right
in
that
no
circuit
other
than
the
sixth
circuit
has
ruled
in
favor
of
taxpayers.
the
tax
court
itself
had
at
times
ruled
in
favor
of
the
taxpayers.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
was
reversed
by
circuits
on
further
review.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
correct.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
1989
amendment
shows
that
congress
understood
the
law
to
be,
and
that
is
certainly
not
determinative
or
conclusive
in
our
view,
but
that
may
well
be,
or
should
be
accorded
some
weight
and
some
consideration
here
in
that
what
congress
understood
the
statute
to
do
is
exactly...
in
1989
is
exactly
what
we
are
contending
it
does,
and
most
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
looked
at
it
have
said
that
it
certainly
appears
that
congress
understood
the
statute
to
exclude
all
punitive
damages
up
to
the
point
at
which
it
amended
it
in
1989.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
they
could
have
been
charged
that,
your
honor,
and
certainly,
if
punitive
damages
are
subject
to
taxation,
they
probably
should
also
be
instructed
that
that
is
the
case,
so
that
the
damages
that
they
are
awarding
will
be
taxed
and
the
plaintiff
will
actually
receive
less
than
the
full
amount
that
the
jury
is
assessing.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that
would
be
generally
a
matter
of
state
law,
where
you're
talking
about
state
tort
actions,
how
the
jury
is
instructed
in
terms
of
those
tax
consequences,
that's
correct.
the
united
states...
and
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
point
about
interpreting
the
statute
as
a
whole,
the
united
states
suggests
that
the
title
that
goes
with
the
statute,
compensation
for
injuries
or
sickness,
suggests
a
more
limited
or
narrower
scope.
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
title
was
not
present
in
1918,
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
there
was
any
debate
by
congress
when
that
title
was
added
as
part
of
apparently
the
codification
process
that
they
were
in
any
sense
altering
or
changing
the
original
scope
of
the
statute.
the
operative
language
has
remained
the
same
from
1918
onward.
what
has
happened,
though,
is
the
tax
laws
were
codified
in
what
was
originally
one
sentence,
drawing
the
distinction
between
accident
or
health
insurance
benefits
and
worker's
comp
benefits
on
the
one
hand
received
as
compensation
and
any
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
that
distinction
has
been
somewhat
obscured
by
the
breaking
down
of
it
into
three...
what
is
now
three
separate
provisions
in
the
tax
code,
(a)(1),
(a)(2),
and
(a)(3).
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
it
does
go
on
to
(a)(5),
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
your
honor,
it's
certainly
our
view
that
you
should
look
primarily
at
the
language
of
(a)(2)
itself,
which
on
its
face
suggests
a
broader
interpretation...
any
damages
received
on
account
of.
it
would
have
been
extraordinarily
easy
for
congress
to
have
said,
as
compensation,
which
it
did
with
the
rest
of
that
statute
when
it
first
enacted
it.
so
that
yes,
the
companions
around
that
provision
perhaps
do
suggest
a
narrower
focus,
but
certainly
in
the
original
provision,
and
the
substantive
language
itself
has
not
changed,
a
broader
construction
is
suggested.
and
again,
without
going
back
through
the
history,
when
you
simply
look
at
these
provisions
today,
that
one
sits
in
the
middle
of
all
these
other
what
appear
to
be
purely
compensatory
provisions,
but
our
view
is,
you
cannot
fully
understand
that
provision
or
give
full
effect
to
its
language
without
looking
back
to
the
history
of
it
and
following
through
how
it
has
come
through
the
first
codification,
the
recodification,
and
how
it
ended
up
where
it
is
today.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
i
think
both
are
important
in
the
sense
that
the
history
is
certainly
relevant,
but
to
the
extent
that
provision
indicates
a
different
scope
than
the
others,
this
court
should
give
effect
to
that
different
scope,
because--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--your
honor,
we
recognize
that
that
principle
is
there.
in
our
view,
the
way
to
deal
with
that
is
that
the
court
should
look
at
the
language
itself,
and
look
at
the
history,
and
we
believe
when
you
do
that,
that
the
language
is
no
longer
so
ambiguous,
so
that
it
is
not
a
choice
of
two
interpretations
competing,
which
we
simply
have
no
way
to
choose
between
one
and
the
other.
in
fact,
the
history
strongly
suggests
that
one
interpretation
is
the
correct
interpretation,
the
broader
interpretation,
but
i
do
recognize
the
existence
of
that
default
rule
as
it's
been
characterized
at
times.
but
we're
suggesting
that
when
you
look
at
all
of
the
surrounding
evidence
here,
the
things
that
justice
souter
has
talked
about,
the
contrast
in
the
language,
the
history
of
the
provision,
where
it
came
from,
and
how
it
got
to
be
where
it
is
today,
that
really
only
one
conclusion
makes
sense
here,
or
at
least
is
the
stronger
conclusion.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that's
basically...
there
should
not
be
a
default
in
this
instance,
because
there's
not
a
situation
where
you
simply
cannot
tell
which
is
the
better
view
based
on
what
evidence
is
available
to
this
court,
and
in
fact
again,
congress
in
1989
essentially
declared
its
understanding,
and
we're
not
suggesting,
as
the
united
states
tries
to
assert
in
its
brief,
that
that
1989
amendment
tells
you
anything
about
intent
in
1918.
we're
simply
saying
congress
demonstrated
that
it
understood
the
statute,
the
language
of
it,
the
meaning
in
1989,
that
all
punitive
damages
received
in
a
personal
injury
suit
were
excluded,
and
that's--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--that's
certainly
possible,
your
honor,
and...
but
what
the
tenth
circuit
clearly
found,
and
i
think
most
courts
that
have
looked
at
this,
when
they
looked
at
the
legislative
history,
the
discussion,
how
this
amendment
came
about,
and
also
the
house
ways
&
means
committee
report,
it
seems
pretty
strong,
the
inference
that
congress
thought
all
of
these
were
excluded,
and
it
wanted
to
limit
that,
and
the
question
was
how
much,
in
exactly
what
fashion.
the
1989
amendment
went
part
way,
the
1996
amendment
went
the
rest
of
the
way
with
respect--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--they
came
out
because
they
ultimately
decided
that
the
reasons,
the
justifications
for
the
competing
views
here
were
essentially
equal,
and
they
resorted
to
what
the
court
called
in
that
case
the
default
rule.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
but
we
do
not
believe
they
are
essentially
equal,
your
honor.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
we
raised
the
issue
in
the
tenth
circuit.
the
tenth
circuit
addressed
it
on
the
merits,
and
under
this
court's
rules
the
government
had
an
obligation
to
object
to
any
procedural
problem
in
its
response
to
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
it
did
not
do
so,
so
i
believe
in
effect
it
has
waived
any
objection,
and
this
court
now,
under
its
precedents,
is
entitled
to
reach
that
issue
on
the
merits,
and
i
do
not
believe
it
makes
a
difference
whether
it's
treated
as
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
not.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
what
the
stipulation
says
is
the
amounts
were
refunded.
they
do
not...
and
basically
what
that
means
is--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--the
amount
was
refunded
on
july
9.
what
that
meant
was
that
was
the
date
on
which
the
check
was
received,
but
it
didn't
say
that
the
refund
was
made,
and
in
our
view
making
should
refer
to
the
last
act
basically
the
government
needs
to
perform
to
complete
the
process,
which
was
after
it's
issued
the
check,
put
it
in
the
mail
to
the
taxpayer.
at
that
point,
the
government
has
made
its
determination,
the
money
is
on
its
way,
and
at
that
point,
that
is
really
the
last
point
at
which
the
government
can
know
with
certainty
its
window
of
opportunity
has
begun
to
run.
after
that--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--no.
we
would
certainly
suggest
that
if
we
had
not
received
the
check,
the
government--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--that's
right.
there
would
be
no
case.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
it
might.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
with
a
private
company,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
know
the
mailbox
rule
for
contract
law.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
right.
we
did
talk
about
the
mailbox
rule
in
contract
law
in
our
reply
brief.
one
point
i'd
like
to
make--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--in
the
first
instance,
yes,
your
honor.
the
1989
amendment,
if
i
could
go
back
to
that
for
a
moment,
this
court
in
burke
in
a
footnote
did
suggest
that
it
has
the
reading,
and
certainly
the
congress
understood
what
we
claim
congress
understood
in
section...
or
in
1989
about--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--right.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
correct.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
thank
you.
