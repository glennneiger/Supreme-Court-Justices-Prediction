well,
it
goes
on
to
(a)(5)
at
this
point,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
make
of
the
textual
argument,
or
the
textual
distinction?
i'm
looking
at
page
22
of
the
government's
brief,
which
quotes
some
of
the
other
subsections.
(a)(1)
provides
an
exclusion
for
certain
sums
as
compensation
for
personal
injuries
or
sickness.
the
(3)
refers,
again,
to
certain
sums
received
for
personal
injuries
and
sickness.
(4)
again
uses
the
for
language,
and
that
suggests
that
the
specific
dollar
amounts
that
they're
referring
to
are
those
which
are
attributable
to
the
sickness
or
the
injury,
as
distinct
from
something
else.
your
subsection
(2)
uses
the
phrase,
on
account
of,
which
would
suggest,
by
contrast,
a
broader
meaning.
which...
we
seem
to
have
a
choice,
i
guess,
of
statutory
interpretation
rules.
we
could
either
say,
well,
the
distinction
presumably
is
intended
to
enact
a
difference,
or
we
could
say,
well,
on
account
of
is
not
entirely
clear
and
we
ought
to
use
the
criterion
of
noscitur
a
sociis.
if
we
want
to
know
what
this
one
means,
which
is
not
clear,
look
to
what
it's
companion
provisions
mean
which
are
clear.
which
of
those
two
criteria
should
we
adopt
in
assessing
the
contrast
in
the
language?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
think
the
history
has
more
significance
than
just
the
contrast
in
the
language
reading
the
statute,
as
justice
scalia
would,
as
a
whole
today?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
jones,
you
quoted...
and
maybe
it's
on
the
same
page.
you
quoted
i
think
someone
who
expressly
drew
the
conclusion
that
congress
meant
to
treat
only
this
subject
and
to
leave--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
other
application...
was
that
in
a
law
journal
article,
or
was
that
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
if
that's...
if
that
really
is
the
criterion,
then
it's
the
date
of
negotiating
the
check.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can
stop
payment
while
it's
in
the
recipient's
hand.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
wouldn't
make
that
argument
if
you
never
received
the
check,
would
you?
