kennedy
mr.
jones,
were
you
going
to
address
the
statute
of
limitations
problem
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
decide
this
case
without
the
effect
of
the
'89
amendment,
but
around
the
corner
there
may
be
a
case
that
arose
in
1991
that
squarely
presents
the
question
whether
the
footnote
in
burke
was
right
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
did
admit
that
the
refund
was
made
on
july
9
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
your
answer
to
the
complaint
is
not
inconsistent
with
that
stip.
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint
you
admitted
that
it
was
july
9.
