justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcallister,
i
don't
understand
your
reference
to
lower
courts.
i
thought
that
this
pre-19...
for
pre-1989
and
post
1989
to
1996
that
all
circuits
said
that
these
awards,
punitive
damages
awards,
whether
on
account
of
personal
injury
or
on
account
of
something
else,
are
taxable.
isn't
that
the
law
in
all
the
circuits
except
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
circuit,
other
than
the
sixth
circuit,
has
ruled
in
favor
of
taxpayers
on
these
challenges?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
tax
court
is
subject...
has
the
skolson
rule,
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is...
in
line
with
your
view,
if
you're
correct
that
these
awards
are
not
taxable,
then
juries
should
have
been
charged,
should
they
not,
that
whatever
you
award
in
punitive
damages
will
not
be
subject
to
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcallister,
what
about
the
ground
rule
in
interpreting
this
dense
tax
code?
everything
is
income
except,
and
exceptions
are
to
be
narrowly
construed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
hard
to
rely
on
the
tenth
circuit
in
support
of
your
position
when
they
came
out
that
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
they
were
essentially
equal,
you
wouldn't
be
quarreling
with
that,
would
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
all
those
circuits
read
it
in
context?
there
were
arguments
presented
to
all
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
works
against
you,
doesn't
it?
the
main
rule
for
income
tax,
as
i
think
everyone
agrees,
is
that
unless
there's
an
exemption
it's
taxable,
and
it
has
always
been
understood
not
simply
in
the
context
of
104,
but
throughout
the
code,
that
if
there's
an
ambiguity
in
an
exemption,
it
should
be
read
in
favor
of
the
government,
not
the
taxpayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
the
words
are
ambiguous,
but
if
you
take
the
history
together
with
the
words,
then
there's
no
ambiguity.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
have
been
in
circuits...
there
was
only
one
outlying
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
the
circuits
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they
answered
that
you
in
turn
waived
because
you
didn't
mention
that
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
thought
that
their
argument
was
simply,
if
we
waived,
then
your
failing
to
bring
up...
to
challenge
the
tenth
circuit
ruling...
the
tenth
circuit
ruling
was
in
favor
of...
the
tenth
circuit
ruling
was
in
favor
of
the
government,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
right,
and
then
they
challenged
that
here,
and
you
didn't
object
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
everybody
agrees...
well,
that
this
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations
that
operates
against
the
taxpayer,
or
no
question
of
sovereign
immunity,
so...
no
one
has
said
this
is
jurisdictional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
we
can
just
get
to
the
merits--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
may
be
right
that
they're
waived.
one
question
that
i
had
is
on
the
question
of
the
date
of
payment.
is
it
the
receipt,
or...
there's
a
section
of
the
code,
6602,
that
talks
about
interest
due
to
the
government
when
the
government
overpays
the
taxpayer
then
gets
back
the
overpayment
with
the
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
date
from
which
the
interest
runs?
it
says
that
the
interest
is
due...
what
is
it,
what
are
the
words?
i
have
the
statute
here.
the
interest...
shall
bear
interest
from
the
date
of
the
payment
of
the
refund.
what
is
the
date
of
the
payment
for
purposes
of
the
interest
provision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
really...
it
didn't
make
any
difference
in
wurtz.
the
key
thing
was
that
they
rejected
the
one
date
that
would
have
made
the
claim
too
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
reason
that
i
ask
the
question
is,
if
the
government's
calculation
of
interest
has
to
depend
on
the
date
of
receipt,
the
government
won't
know
that.
i
mean,
it
knows
when
it
mails
the
check,
but
it
doesn't
know...
so
when
it
reclaims
the
overpayment
and
sends
the
interest
bill
at
the
same
time,
how
will
it
know
the
starting
date
for
the
interest,
because
it
doesn't
know
the
date
of
receipt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
wurtz
a
little
bit
like
burke
in
that
respect?
all
wurtz
has
to
do
is
to
say
that
the
time
hasn't
run,
period.
it
had
to
reject
one
reading.
whatever
it
said
about...
there
were
a
number
of
dates
you
could
pick.
only
one
was
out
of
the
ball
park.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you
said
it
would
be
the
same
thing
for
the
interest,
and
so
the
interest,
that
would
be
even
more
uncertain,
the
date
the
check
is
cashed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
just
oversight
that
you
didn't
bring
this
up
in
the
first
instance?
