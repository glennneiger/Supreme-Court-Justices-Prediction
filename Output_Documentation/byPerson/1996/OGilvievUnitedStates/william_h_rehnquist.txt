we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-966,
kevin
o'gilvie
and
stephanie
o'gilvie,
minors
v.
united
states,
and
95-977,
kelly
o'gilvie
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
mcallister.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
you've
now
used
the
term,
in
connection
with,
but
the
statute
says
on
account
of,
and
it's
my
impression
the
government's
position
is
that
punitive
damages
are
not
on
account
of
the
personal
injuries.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
possible,
isn't
it,
that
congress
might
in
an
excess
of
caution
amend
the
statute,
feeling
perhaps
the
statute,
the
existing
language
gives
the
result
we
want,
but
we
want
to
make
absolutely
sure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mcallister.
ms.
king,
we'll
hear
from
you.
please
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
schleier
a
liquidated
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
any
time
there's
a
dissenting
opinion
taking
a
different
view
of
the
statute,
that's
a
sign
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
three
out
of
nine
dissent,
then
it's
ambiguous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
you
want
a
clear
intent
to
exclude?
i
mean,
because
of
the
basic
ground
rule
that
everything
is
presumed
to
be
income?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
king.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we...
what
if
this
came
up
from
a
state
where
the
supreme
court
had
said
something
else
about...
something
more
favorable
to
the
petitioners
about
the
nature
of
exemplary
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
page
30?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
leave
what
wasn't
covered
there
to
the
preexisting
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
refund
at
least
requires
delivery.
i
mean,
if
the
government
simply
draws
a
check
and
keeps
it,
surely
nothing
is
started.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
is
not
going
to
know
when
the
statute
of
limitations
runs,
if
in
fact
it
isn't
the
time
it
mailed,
but
the
time
it's
received
by
somebody.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
doesn't
win
if
it's
the
date
of
mailing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
mcallister,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
do
you
agree
that
if
we
don't
hold
the
statute
jurisdictional
that
you
have
waived
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcallister.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
