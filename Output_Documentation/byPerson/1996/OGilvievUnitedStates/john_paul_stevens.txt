justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
going
to
tell
us
why
you
win
if
it's
ambiguous,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
i
think
you're
coming
to
your...
before
you
leave,
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
the
1989
amendment.
now,
i
understand
that
of
course
it
doesn't
govern
this
case,
because
it
happened
later,
but
let's
assume
that
if
that
had
been
in
the
statute
from
the
beginning,
would
you
not
think
that
the
better
reading
of
the
statute
would
have
been
that
punitive
damages
were
excludable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
a
fair
reading
of
it,
as
your
opponent
argues,
to
suggest
that
the
congress
that
enacted
that
amendment
must
have
assumed
that
punitive...
this
sort
of
punitive
damages
were
excludable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
make--
--what
the--
--the
case
a
little
harder
for
you,
and
then...
supposing
some
of
us
felt
that
we
shouldn't
look
at
legislative
history.
then
it
would
be
a
little
bit
harder
to
explain,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
way
justice
blackmun
described
it
in
burke
was
that
the
enactment
allowed
exclusion
of
punitive
damages
only
in
cases
involving
physical
injury
or
physical
sickness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
you
think
we
ought
to
disavow
the
footnote
in
burke.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
it
really
would
be
ironic
if
we
were
to
say
the
law
was
pretty
clear
up
to
'89,
and
that's
all
involved
now,
and
it's
clear
now
after
'96,
but
in
this
interval,
if
you
read
the
statute
on
its
face
during
that
period,
someone
might
say,
well,
there's
a
different
result
in
here,
and
that's
why...
one
of
the
things
that
concerns
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
takes
care
of
everything--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
any
punitive
damages
were
awarded
during
those
years?
i
doubt
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
bills--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--notes
under
ni...
normal
law
in
making
is
the
date
on
the
check.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
said
that
in
rejecting
an
argument
that
you
should
look
at
the
date
when
the
refund
was
authorized,
which
was
clearly
wrong.
it
really
didn't
focus
on
this
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
use
the
words,
date
of
payment.
