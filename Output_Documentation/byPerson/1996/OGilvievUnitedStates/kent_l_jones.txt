mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
terms
ago,
in
commissioner
v.
schleier,
this
court
held
that
an
award
of
damages
that
is
punitive
in
nature
rather
than
compensatory
does
not
constitute
damages
on
account
of
personal
injury
within
the
meaning
of
section
104(a)(2).
that
holding
applies
directly
to
this
case,
and
is
compelled
by
the
text,
structure,
history,
and
purpose
of
this
statute.
the
text
of
the
statute
provides
an
exclusion
from
income
only
for
damages
awarded
on
account
of
the
personal
injury.
it
does
not,
as
petitioners
contend,
encompass
simply
any
recovery
obtained
in
an
action
in
connection
with
a
personal
injury.
indeed,
that
precise
contention
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
schleier.
in
schleier,
the
court
said
that
whether
the
underlying
cause
of
action
is
on
account
of,
or
rather,
whether
the
damages
are
received
in
connection
with
an
underlying
cause
of
action
that
is
a
tort-type
action
for
personal
injuries
is
not,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
analysis.
instead,
as
the
court
emphasized
in
schleier,
each
element
of
the
recovery
must
be
on
account
of
the
personal
injury
for
the
statutory
exclusion
to
apply.
only
damages
that
compensate
for
a
loss
and
are
attributable
to
it
are
on
account
of
the
injury
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
as
this
court
said
40
years
ago
in
commissioner
v.
glenshaw
glass,
damages
for
personal
injury
are
by
definition
compensatory
only,
and
do
not
include
punitive
and
other
ancillary
recoveries.
this
court's
decision
in
schleier
provides
two
applications
of
the
statute
in
this
context.
the
court
in
schleier
did
not
doubt
that
age
discrimination
effects
personal
injuries
to
the
victims
of
the
discrimination,
but
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
two
remedies
provided
by
statute
for
that
discrimination,
back
wages
and
liquidated
damages
for
willful
violations
of
the
act,
did
not
compensate
for
those
personal
injuries,
were
not
attributable
to
those
injuries.
they
therefore
were
not
on
account
of
those
injuries
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the...
in...
sorry,
i've
obviously
lost
my
train
of
thought.
because
the
damages
are
not
awarded
on
account
of
the
injury,
they're
not
within
the
scope
of
the
statutory
exclusion
from
income
which,
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
must
be
narrowly
interpreted
and
applied.
now,
punitive
damages
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
never
been
held
to
be
compensation,
and
they
are
not
awarded
on
account
of
an
injury.
punitive
damages,
as
this
court
has
often
said,
are
a
civil
fine
awarded
to
punish
and
to
deter
reprehensible
conduct,
they
are
not
compensation
for
the
injury
itself,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
kansas
cases
on
which
petitioners
now
rely
for
the
first
time
in
their
reply
brief
make
exactly
that
same
point.
in
brewer
v.
homestead
production
company,
at
200
kansas,
page
96,
the
kansas
supreme
court
states,
and
i
quote,
"in
this
state
exemplary
damages
are
not
regarded
as
compensatory
in
any
degree.
"
that
is
exactly
the
statement
that
the
court
made
in
molzof,
that
this
court
made
in
molzof
and
in
gertz.
now--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--sometimes,
if
you
will,
writing
it
in
academic
fashion,
courts
look
at
the
fact
that
these
moneys
go
to
the
plaintiff
and
say,
perhaps
they
serve
a
compensatory
purpose
in
that
respect.
the
money
goes
there.
but
no
court
to
my
knowledge
has
held
that
a
jury
may
award
punitive
damages
as
additional
compensation.
what
courts
instruct
juries,
and
what
juries
do,
is
they
award
punitive
damages
as
deterrence
and
comp...
and
punishment
for
particular
types
of
egregious
misbehavior.
the
kansas
supreme
court
is
a
classic
example
of
that,
because
the
kansas
supreme
court
said,
well,
punitive
damages
are
not
compensatory
in
any
degree,
but
a
jury
may
consider
the
amount
of
actual
damages
in
deciding
what
punitive
damages
are
appropriate
to
accomplish
the
state's
independent
objectives
of
punishing
and
deterring
the
conduct.
as
the
fifth
circuit
said
just
last
year
in
estate
of
moore
v.
commissioner,
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
which
i've
mentioned
to
petitioner's
counsel...
it's
at
53
f.
3d
at
716...
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
estate
of
moore
is
that
this
fact
does
not
make
a
punitive
award
a
compensatory
one.
it
does
not,
as
the
court
said
in
that
case,
change
the
fundamental
truth
that
punitive
damages
are
awarded
only
on
account
of
and
in
proportion
to
the
defendant's
wrongful
conduct.
thus,
that
court
and
all
but
one
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
concluded
that
punitive
damages
being
awarded
on
account
of
the
reprehensible
conduct
and
not
as
compensation
to
the
injuries
do
not
come
within
the
statutory
exclusion.
the
one
court
that
reached
a
different
conclusion,
the
horton
case
in
the
sixth
circuit,
relied
solely
on
a
rationale
that
this
court
flatly
rejected
in
schleier.
what
the
court
said
in
horton
is
that
any
recovery
obtained
in
an
action
based
upon
a
personal
injury
is
exempt
from
tax
for
that
reason
alone.
in
fact,
in
horton
the
court
said,
that
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
analysis.
in
schleier,
although
this
court
didn't
cite
horton,
the
court
referred
to
that
same
contention
and
said,
that
is
not
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
analysis.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
a...
it
is
the...
it
is
the
explanation
of
why
those
damages
aren't
on
account
of
the
personal
injury,
but
the
court
said--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
what
the
court
acknowledged
in
schleier
was
that
age
discrimination,
the
but-for,
but
for
age
discrimination
these
recoveries
would
not
have
been
obtained,
but
the
court
pointed
out
that
these
recoveries
were
not
on
account
of
that
personal
injury
that
stems
from
the
age
discrimination.
the
personal
injury
is
not
compensated
by
back
wages
and
by
liquidated
or
punitive
damages
under
the
adea.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
but
that's
the
point.
the
question
in
these
cases
is
not
what
is
the
gravamen
in
the
complaint.
the
question
is
whether
the
recovery
is
on
account
of
the
personal
injury.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
there
was
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--actually,
i...
justice
scalia,
we...
only
by
reference
to
the
opinion
can
this
question
be
answered,
but
my
recollection
of
the
opinion
is
that
the
court
acknowledged
in
schleier
that
age
discrimination
effects
personal
injuries.
the
court
also
acknowledged
in
schleier,
twice
in
a
footnote
and
once
in
the
text,
that
if
the
compensation
obtained
under
the
act
was
on
account
of
those
injuries,
it
would
be
within
the
statutory
exclusion,
but
what
the
court
quite
clearly
held
was
that
an
award
that
is
punitive
in
nature
rather
than
compensatory
cannot
be
said
to
be
on
account
of
the
injuries,
which
is
what
five
of
the
circuits
have
concluded
when
the
same
issue
has
been
presented
in
the
context
of
this
case.
the
text
of
the
statute
in
our
view,
and
i
believe
in
the
court's
view
in
schleier,
compelled
that
conclusion.
the
title
and
structure
of
the
act
reflect
the
same
understanding.
the
title
of
section
104
is,
compensation
for
injuries
and
sickness.
each
of
the
subsections
of
the
statute
relate
solely
to
compensation
for
different
types
of
injuries.
none
of
them
provide
an
exemption
from
tax
for
any
recovery
that's
not
compensatory.
the
history
of
the
act
is
fairly
clear
on
this.
each...
several
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
described
in
detail
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
derived
directly
from
the
1918
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
holding
that
recoveries
for
personal
injuries
are
akin
to
a
return
of
capital.
they
merely
make
the
taxpayer
whole
for
a
personal
loss,
and
would
not
represent
income
as
that
term
was
then
understood.
as
this
court
said
40
years
after
that
in
glenshaw
glass,
that
underlying
rationale
supports
exclusion
of
compensatory
awards,
but
it
does
not
support
exclusion
of
punitive
damages.
the
text,
the
structure,
the
history,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
all
support
this
conclusion.
it's
also
compelled
at
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
a
difficult
hypothetical,
but
if
it
had
been
in
the
statute
from
the
beginning
with
the
history
that
it
had,
my
answer
would
be
that
it
does
not
affect
the
outcome
in
this
case.
i
mean,
we
briefed
rather
clearly,
i
thought,
on
this
subject.
the
1989
amendment
quite
clearly
was
designed
to
answer
the
question
it
addresses,
and
was
quite
clearly
designed
not
to
answer
any
other
question.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is
neither
factually
nor
legally
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute.
it's
not
factually
a
fair
reading
because
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
carefully
crafted
this
provision
to
avoid
taking
a
position
on
whether
punitive
damages
were
excluded
for
physical
injury
cases.
they
wanted
to
solve
this
question
about
punitive
damages
in
nonphysical
injury
cases.
they
had
an
agreement,
they
had
a
majority
to
accomplish
that.
they
did
not
have
a
majority,
or
an
agreement
to
accomplish
the
resolution
of
the
entire--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no.
that's
my
legal
point.
legally
it
would
still
be
irrelevant,
because
it
is
quite
clear
that
exclusions
from
income
are
not
to
be
obtained
by
inference.
you
cannot
use
a
negative
inference
out
of
the
1989
amendment
to
create...
to
do
what
frankly
what
this
court
said
in
its
footnote
in
burke,
that
this
amendment
allows
the
recovery
of
punitive
damages
in
physical
injury
cases.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
that's
not
the
way
it's
written,
justice
scalia.
what
the
1989--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
i'm
sure
that
it
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
what...
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
justice
scalia--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
quote
the
provisions
from
the
1989
act.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
what
it
says
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
the
middle
of
the
full
paragraph.
it
says,
the
house
bill
was
modified
to
provide
only
that
the
section
104(a)(2)
exclusion
shall
not
apply
to
any
punitive
damages
received
in
connection
with
a
case
not
involving
physical
injury.
to
take
that
to
mean
the
positive
you
have
to
infer
that
therefore
any
punitive
damages
awarded
in
a
case
involving
punitive...
involving
physical
injuries
is
to
be
excluded.
that's
the
kind
of
exclusion
by
implication
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
this
court
would
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
way
that
the
provision
had
read...
i'm
speaking
from
memory
now.
this
isn't
in
here,
although
it's
described
in
here.
the
way
the
provision
read
before
it
was
amended
in
conference
would
have
provided
that
amounts
atrib...
punitive
damages
received
in
connection
with
a
claim
involved
in
puni...
physical
injury
are
excluded.
in
other
words,
it
would
have
said
exactly
what
you're
saying
it
should
be
inferred
this--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absolutely,
and
i
think,
justice
scalia,
with
all
respect,
that
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
indicates,
and
the
only
point
i'm
making...
well,
there's
two
points.
one
is,
none
of
this
matters
to
the
resolution
of
this
case,
but
the
other
point
is,
this
court
has
often
said,
and
i
think
it's
an
important
holding,
that
exclusions
from
income
are
nonimplied.
that
is
to
say,
there
must
be
an
express
exclusion,
and
to
create
an
inference
out
of
these
two
negatives
is
not
unimaginable,
it's
just
not
consistent
with
the
way
that
the
court
would
approach
these
kinds
of
questions.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
what
we
quoted
was
his
article,
but
what
he
relies
on
is
the
legislative
history
in
detail.
i've
read
the
article,
and
he
has
a
very
detailed
explanation
of
the
various
drafts
of
the
bill
and
the
statements
within
the
committee.
if
that
issue
were
relevant
to
the
disposition
of
the
case,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
that
more
detailed
discussion
on
that
subject.
i
also
need
to
correct
what
i
believe
is
a
fundamental
misstatement
of
counsel
on
this
issue.
having
heard
his
argument,
i
would
get
the
impression
that
most
courts
had
interpreted
the
'89
amendment
to
help
their
case.
in
fact,
all
but
one
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
about
this
1989
amendment
almost
exactly
what
i've
just
said
to
the
court,
that
it
doesn't
address
this
issue,
it
addresses
a
different
issue,
it
consciously
addressed
a
narrow
issue,
and
consciously
left
this
other
issue
untouched,
just
as
congress
did
in
the
'96
amendment,
where
they
prospectively
authoritatively
determined
punitive
damages
are
not
within
the
statutory
exclusion,
which
really
brings
me
to
my
last
point.
in
our
view,
and
in
the
view
of
the
tax
court
in
the
bagley
case,
this
court's
opinion
in
schleier
resolved
this
issue.
it
says
that
damages
that
are
punitive
in
nature
and
not
compensatory
are
not
within
the
statutory
exclusion
precisely
because
they're
not
awarded
on
account
of
the
personal
injury.
that
is
exactly
what
the
treasury
said
in
its
1984
ruling
on
this
subject.
it
said
that
the
punitive
damages
are
not
on
account
of
the
injury,
they're
not
compensation
for
the
injury,
they're
not
within
the
statutory
exclusion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i...
that
will
be
my
next
point.
i
think
i
have
time.
the...
schleier
being
only
18
months
old,
i
mean,
it
seems
obvious
to
point
out
that
the
principles
of
stare
decisis
are
very
strong
in
tax
cases,
and
they
should
be
especially
strong
in
this
context,
where
congress
has
prospectively
reached
the
same
conclusion
in
amending
the
statute
for
all
tax
years
this
day
forward.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
the
footnote
in
burke
was
dicta,
and
i
think
it's
honest
to
say
that
the
court
wasn't
briefed
on
that
issue,
and
other
courts
have
said
that
they
believe
that
that
statement
was
dicta.
clearly...
and
the
1989
amendment
has
not
yet
actually
been
before
the
court,
although
this
is
the
third
section--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that's
why
the
'96
amendment
was--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--prospectively.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
mean,
it
removes
the
shadow
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
would
hope,
and
i'm
sure
the
court
would
hope
that
that
case
doesn't
come
around
the
corner.
[laughter]
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
in
all--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
circuits
have
not
had
any
difficulty
with
this
issue
about
the
'89
amendment.
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
petitioners
claim
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
suits
to
recover
an
erroneous
refund
expired
before
this
suit
was
brought
by
the
government.
that
contention
is
wrong
for
two
reasons.
first,
petitioners
don't
dispute
that
they
did
not
raise
this
issue
in
the
district
court,
and
when
they
raised
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
did
so
solely
on
the
theory
that
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute
of
limitations
would
deprive
the
court
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
now,
as
we
state
in
our
brief,
and
as
petitioners
do
not
address
at
all,
this
is
an
ordinary
type
of
statute
of
limitations
that
limits
only
the
recovery
on
the
claim.
it
does
not
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
thus,
even
if
the
statute
of
limitations
had
not
been
complied
with,
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction,
the
lower
courts
would
have
jurisdiction,
and
such
a
holding
would
therefore
have
no
remedial
significance.
they
can't
raise
at
this
point
a
suggestion
that
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute
was
an
affirmative
defense,
because
they
waived
the
issue
by
not
raising
it
in
the
district
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
my
point
on
that
issue
is
that
the
court,
because
this
relates
only
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
court
has
to
decide,
it
seems
to
me,
first
whether
this
claim
relates
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
because
if
it
just
decided
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
as
an
unanchored
legal
principle,
it
would
have
no
remedial
significance
in
this
case
and
the
court
rarely,
to
my
knowledge
has
never
decided
an
issue
that
doesn't
have
remedial
significance.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
on
the
merits.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
on
the
merits
of
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
only
on
the
merits.
we
didn't
point
out,
as
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--oh,
well,
that's
their...
that's
the
only
basis
on
which
they
have
raised
it,
even
to
this
point,
and
it's
the
only
basis
on
which
the
court
could
address
it.
i...
it's,
just
to
repeat
myself,
but
i
think
it's
the
reason
why
even
if
under...
the
court
might
say,
well,
you...
the
government
didn't
raise
this
point.
the
point
that
we
didn't
raise
is
that
this
statute
doesn't
relate
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
well,
i
suppose
that's
a
jurisdictional
point,
and
i
suppose
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
it
relates
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
before
it
decides--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
have
the
text
of
that
in
front
of
me,
but
as
you've
described
it,
i'm
not...
i
don't
hear
any
words
that
would
lead
me
to
think
that
it
would
be
different
from
the
date
of
the
payment,
the
making
of
the
refund
in
this
context,
because
what
the
court
held
in
united
states
v.
wurtz
is
that
the
date
of
the
making
of
the
refund
is
the
date
on
which
the
refund
was
paid.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
put
this
point
in
perspective,
just
to
state
it
from
the
beginning.
section--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
ginsburg,
you've
triggered
a
recollection
that
is
only
vague
for
me.
i
believe
that
there
may
be
a
regulation,
or
even
an
additional
statutory
provision
that
addresses
the
precise
point
you're
making
under
that
interest
statute,
and
i
do
not
remember
exactly
what
it
says,
so
i'm
afraid
i
can't
be
of
too
much
help
to
you
on
that,
other
than
to
say
that
i
do
believe
that
there's
some
specific
substantive
provision
of
law
that
has
been
adopted
to
address
that
point.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
a
contract
may
be
made
by
putting
it
in
the
mail
as
a
matter
of
common
law
rule.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
a
refund--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
that
may
also
be
true--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--but
what's
relevant
here
is
that
what
has
to
be
made
is
a
refund,
and
what
the
court
said
in
wurtz
is
that
a
refund
is
the
actual
repayment.
it's
not
a
contract,
it's
not
a
check--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--oh,
i
don't
think
it
focused
on
it,
but
i
think
in--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
every...
and
i
should
point
out
every
court
that
has
addressed
this
issue
has
concluded--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--oh,
of
course
not,
and
as
this
court
did
say
in
wurtz,
and
i
think
it
answers
this
question
if
the
other
part
that
i've
quoted
doesn't,
is
that
a
payment,
which
the
court
said
is
what
a
refund
is,
a
payment
isn't
made
even
when
the
check
is
mailed
and...
signed
and
mailed--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--because
the
payment
can
be
stopped.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
one...
one
obvious
difference
is
that...
is
this
court's
law
in
addition
to
wurtz.
i
think
wurtz
answers
this
question,
but
even
if
one
wanted
to
look
beyond
wurtz--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
the
difference
is
that
in
wurtz
we're
talking
about
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
court,
and
in
burke
we
were
talking
about
a
footnote
that
related
to
a
statute
that
wasn't
before
the
court
and
wasn't
involved.
the
ratio
decidendi
of
burke...
of
wurtz
was
that
a
refund
is
an
actual
repayment.
it
is
not
simply
putting
the
check
in
the
mail,
because
the
check
can
be
cancelled
and
the
payment
stopped,
as
the
court
said.
now,
there's
one
other
reason--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
think
that
might
be
the
most--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
might
be
the
most
faithful
application
of
the
statute,
and
frankly
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
want
to
make
it
clear,
justice
ginsburg,
that
i
don't
believe
i
have
a
view
on
the
interest
issue
at
this
point.
i'm
just
not
in
a
position
to
give
you
an
answer
on
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
court
pointed
out
in
wurtz
that
it
is
implausible
to
think
that
congress
started
the
statute
of
limitations
running
on
a
date
before
the
cause
of
action
accrued.
the
cause
of
action
here
accrues
only
when
the
payment
is
made.
it
does
not
accrue
simply
by
putting
a
check
in
the
mail.
we
can't
sue
someone
for
an
erroneous
refund
because
we
sent
them
a
check.
we
can
sue
them
because
they
received
money
that
we
want
back.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
they
would,
and
when...
and
there
would
be
records
on
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
as
i
said,
i
think
that's
the
most
faithful
reading
of
the
statute.
it's
a
reading
that
some
courts
have
adopted.
there
are
two
district
court
opinions
that
have
stopped
short
and
said
it's
the
date
of
receipt,
but
under
any
interpretation
that
any
court
has
ever
expressed,
the
government
wins
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
would
be
the
only
circumstance
in
which
the
government
would
not
win,
and
there's
no
authority
to
support
that
proposition.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
any
event,
we
believe
it
was
quite
clearly
waived.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'm
through.
thank
you.
