is
there,
then,
if
you
don't...
is
there
any
reason...
what
i
thought
of
doing
to
answer
this
is
to
look
up
how
the
law
works
in
the
area
of
contracts
and
how
it
works
in
the
area
of
money
had
and
received,
say
an
insurance
company
that
makes
an
erroneous
refund.
how
does
the
statute
of
limitations
work
there?
my
guess,
from
recollecting
my
first
year
of
law
of
contracts
is
that
the
contract
is
good
when
it's...
the
acceptance
is
mailed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
therefore
the
statute
of
limitations
would
run
from
that
time,
and
i
bet
it's
the
same
with
money
had
and
received,
that
it's
made--

why
would
we
want
one

justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
would
we
want
one
rule
when
an
insurance
company
makes
a
refund,
or
any
private
person,
and
the
government
have
a
different
rule
when
it's
totally
silent
on
the
matter?
why
wouldn't
a
refund
for
the
law
be
good
on
mailing
or
not
good
on
mailing
for
everybody
alike?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know
how
it
works
with
a
private
company?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
might
be
the
right
rule,
but
nobody's...
we
haven't
looked
it
up
yet.
