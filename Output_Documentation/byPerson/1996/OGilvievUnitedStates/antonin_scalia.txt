justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that
set
forth?
i
wish
there
were
some
place
where
the
whole
text
of
the
current
code
is
set
forth,
including
that
amendment,
and
there
was
an
'89
amendment?
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
of
course,
you
know,
when
i
read
the
united
states
code
i
don't
do
it
piece
by
piece
and
figure
out
which
paragraph
was
enacted
in
1918
and
which
was
enacted
in
1989,
or
1996.
i
read
it
as
a
whole,
and
it
seems
to
me
one
has
to
decide
whether
punitive
damages
are
covered
or
not
on
the
basis
of
the
whole
text
as
it
now
appears.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
to
see
the
whole
thing
set
forth
somewhere.
mr.
mcallister,
as
far
as
the
most
recent
amendment
is
concerned
the
effective
date
is
from
the
time
of
that
enactment,
so
that
is
not
law
for
purposes
of
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
the
'89
amendment?
was
that
also
only
prospective?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
default,
is
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
four
out
of
nine?
[laughter]
but
your
position
is,
it's
not
ambiguous.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
conclusion
you
were
going
to
come
to
was,
then
there
is
no
ambiguity.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case,
it
seems
to
me
your
case
would
be
a
lot
easier.
justice
antonin
scalia
aren't
you
basically
saying
there's
no
ambiguity?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
we
don't
interpret
things
out
of
context.
i
mean--
[laughter]
--when
we
ask
whether
it's
ambiguous,
we
mean
whether
it's
ambiguous
in
context,
right?
isn't
that
what
we
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
they
were
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
were
taking
it
out
of
context--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
and
ambiguity
out
of
context
doesn't
apply,
right,
doesn't
count?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
schleier
we
also
said
that
whether
one
treats
respondents
attaining
the
age
of
60,
or
his
being
laid
off
on
account
of
his
age,
as
the
proximate
cause
of
respondent's
loss
of
income,
neither
the
birthday
nor
the
discharge
can
fairly
be
described
as
a
personal
injury
or
sickness.
i
mean,
isn't
that
one
explanation
of
schleier
that
doesn't
apply
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
personal
injury
is
what
we
were
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
sentence
suggests
to
me
that
we
thought
that
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
was
not
personal
injury
or
sickness,
and
that's
a
totally
different
point
from
whether
it
was
on
account
of
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
but
it
has
to
be
on
account
of
personal
injury
or
sickness,
but
you're
laying
schleier
before
us
as
though
what
it
proves
is
that
there
was
no
on
account
of
there,
which
is
what
this
case
involves.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
really
what
i
think
it
proves
is
that
there
was
no
physical
injury
or
sickness
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
a
negative
inference.
this
is
simply
application
of
the
usual
rule
that
you
interpret
every
word
of
a
statute
as
having
some
effect.
those
words
except
for,
you
know...
except
for
punitive
damages
in
these
other
areas
would
have
been
totally
unnecessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
the
text?
i
don't
have
the
text
right
in
front
of
me.
is
it
in
your
brief
at
some
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
my
point
is,
unless
that
is
what
congress...
i
don't
care
what
congress
had
in
mind
unless
that's
what
the
text--
[laughter]
--of
the
statute
had
in
mind.
the
language
with
a
case
not
involving
physical
injury
or
physical
sickness
could
have
simply
been
left
out.
in
order
to
give
that
phrase
any
meaning,
you
must
assume
that
where
it
is
a
case
involving
physical
injury
or
physical
sickness,
punitive
damages
are
included
within
the
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
using
legislative
history
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
were
just
going
to
look
at
the
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
looking
at
the
text,
there
is
no
other
explanation
for
the
whole
phrase,
in
connection
with
a
case
not
involving
physical
injury
or
physical
sickness.
you
may
as
well
have
dropped
it
out
entirely
unless
you
assume
that
in
those
cases
it
is
within
the
exemption.
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
mr.
jones,
is
that
congress
wished
to
deal
with
this
particular
category--
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if
you
use
what
you
say
may
be
the
most
faithful
position,
which
is
at
the
time
the
payment
is
actually
made
by
the
government,
the
government
would
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
exclude
that
as
a
possibility.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
wouldn't
be
suing
to
get
it
back,
either--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
never
received
it.
[laughter]
but
it
might
be
saying--
--sort
of
a
nonexistent
problem.
it
might
be
saying
that
it
had
made
the
refund.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
these
tax
years
were
all
before
1989
though,
weren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
fact
the
way
the
law
read
at
the
time
that's
relevant
here
did
not
contain
the
1989
amendment.
