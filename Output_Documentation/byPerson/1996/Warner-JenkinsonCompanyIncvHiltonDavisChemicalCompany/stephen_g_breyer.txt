justice

g.
breyer
so
if
the...
counsel
cannot
foresee
every
possible
circumstance
in
which
this
invention
could
be
used,
and
a
new
circumstance
arises,
one
that
the
patent
office
had
thought
it
wouldn't
work.
they
didn't
think
a
cylindrical
tank
would
work
on
mountaintops,
or
that
this
would
work
at
a
low...
at
a
high...
at
a
low
ph,
and
they
were
wrong.
the
invention
works
at
that
low
ph,
or
on
the
mountaintop.
the
patentee
is
just
out
of
luck?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
can
counsel
foresee
everything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
go
back
for
a
second
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
and
you
were
talking
about
synonyms.
i'm
trying
to
understand
how
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
works.
suppose
that
i
have
invented
five
chemicals,
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
and
you
put
them
together
and
it
grows
hair,
for
example.
[laughter]
and
then
sometime
in
the
future,
15
years
from
now,
people
discover
a
new
chemical,
didn't
even
exist
before.
it's
called
x,
and
it
does
the
same
as
a,
and
so
they
do
the
same
thing,
but
they
use
x,
and
then
i
guess
that's
equivalent,
and
then
i'm
going
to
obviously
say,
then
they
invent
y,
and
then
z,
and
pretty
soon
instead
of
a,
b,
c,
d
and
e,
what
we
have
are
five
totally
new
chemicals,
didn't
exist
before,
but
still
grows
hair
in
the
same
way,
same
function,
same...
now,
is
that
supposed
to
be
equivalent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
so,
you
see,
i
think
the
lawyers
on
the
other
side
are
arguing,
my
goodness,
we're
supposed
to
advise
clients,
and
we
have
no
idea
how
to
do
it,
because
we
read
the
patent
thing
and
we
know
with
this
doctrine
people
might
discover
all
kinds
of
new
chemicals
in
the
future,
and
we
just
don't
know
how
to
do
it,
and
so
what
we're
groping
for,
is
there
then
no
limitation
on
this
doctrine
of
equivalents?
i
mean,
how
do
you
prevent
it
from
becoming
so
uncertain
an
element
that
it
becomes
impossible
to
advise
the
client?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you've...
oh--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still
a
little
worried
about
the
army
of
experts
possibly
in
a
chemical
case
or
biotechnology,
on
either
side
arguing
that
two
substances
that
are
made
up
really
of
very
different
chemicals
are
in
fact
made
up
of
chemicals
that
do
the
equivalent
thing,
and
at
some
period
of
time
it
would
have
been
obvious
to
some
group
of
people.
it's
the
uncertainty
inherent
in
that
kind
of
procedure
that
makes
me
ask
if
you
can
consider
some
limitations
on
this
doctrine
that
would
prevent
my
concern
from
becoming
real.
