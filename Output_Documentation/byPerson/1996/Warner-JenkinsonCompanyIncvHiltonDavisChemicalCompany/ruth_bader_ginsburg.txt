mr.
taranto,
you've
said...
maybe
i
have
it
wrong...
that
the
pto
made
a
mistake
of
fact
as
to
the
6
and
above.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
you're
saying
about
the...
when
the
pto
makes
it
precise,
that's
it
and
you
can't
have
any
doctrine
of
equivalents,
but
wasn't
there
a
difference
between
requiring
9
and
under
and
the
6?
i
thought
it
was
the
prior
art
that
was
the
blockage
to
going
above
9.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
no,
you
said
the
federal
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--thinking
that
6
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
pto's
concern,
but
if
the
pto
did
have
a
concern
and
insisted
on
the
number
6
being
put
in,
approximately
6,
that
concern
was
different
than
the
prior
art
ruled
out
a
patent
or
a
number
higher
than
9.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing,
because
what
you've
said
is
substantially
different
from
what
i
gathered
from
your
footnote,
and
it
is
different
from
what
judges
plager
and
lourie
said.
they
said
the
reason
this
doesn't
go
to
the
jury
is
because
it's
equitable.
i
understand
you
to
be
saying,
no,
you
recognize
that
the
color
of
the
claim
depends
on
the
relief,
and
so...
but
you're
saying
it's
like
defining
the
claim.
therefore,
even
though
the
case
is
entirely
legal...
say
we
just
want
damages,
no
injunction...
the
case
is
entirely
legal,
but
it
goes
to
the
judge.
you
are
disavowing
what
was
the
suggestion
of
this
note,
that
it
somehow
the
legal
law
equity
divide
that
places
this
in
the
judge's
bailiwick.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
i
don't
follow,
mr.
wallace,
because
as
i
understand,
this
was
a
courtmade
doctrine
developed
for
cases,
could
be
applied
in
a
case
where
injunctive
relief
was
sought,
could
be
applied
where
legal
relief
was
sought,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
wasn't
an
equitable
remedy
to
relieve
the
rigors
of
the
harsh
common
law
system.
it
was
the
way
common
law
courts
operate.
they
had
a
doctrine,
and
they
applied
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
do
i
understand
that
the
united
states
is
attempting
to
persuade
other
nations
to
adopt
something
equivalent
to
the
doctrine
of
equivalents,
and
if
that's
correct,
what
is
the
definition
that
the
united
states
is
recommending
to
the
rest
of
the
world,
and
how
does
it
differ,
if
it
does,
from
the
federal
circuit's
decision
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
you
do
that,
can
you
just
clarify
your
opening
statement?
it
is
your
view
that
ordinarily
the
question
of
the
prior
history
and
what
that
precludes,
that
that
is
ordinarily
a
question
for
the
judge,
but
it
was
just
happenstance
that
the
parties
agreed
that
it
would
go
to
the
jury,
because
i
thought
that
that
was
one
question
for
this
court
to
decide.
if
you're
not
disputing
it,
then
i
guess
everybody
agrees
that
prosecution
history
estoppel
is
for
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right,
but
you
don't
dispute
that
the
rule
is
prosecution
history
estoppel
is
a
question
for
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
clear
from
the
fifth
circuit
model
instructions.
the
fifth
circuit
has
approved
the
model
instructions
on
infringement,
and
it
does
say
that
designing
around
is
a
factor
in
favor
of
the
alleged
infringer,
just
as
copying
is
a
factor
in
favor
of
the
patentee.
