justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
raise...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
does
that
place
you
in
the
following
odd
position,
and
i
may
not
understand
your
position,
so
let
me
raise
it
now.
your...
sort
of
your
fallback
position
is
that
the
doctrine
not
to
apply
only
in
a
case
in
which
the
so-called
point
of
equivalence
was
within
the
claim
that
was
actually
made,
but
which
for
some
reason
would
not
have
been
enforceable,
the
claim
was,
for
whatever
reason,
too
broad.
and
yet,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
and
that's
what
your
position
would
be,
then
the
person
who
claims
too
much,
but
invalidly,
is
in
a
better
position
than
the
person
who,
before
the
patent
examiner,
gives
up
more
than
he
has
to,
because
the
patent
office
indicates
that
without
such
a
concession
they
won't
give
their
approval,
and
doesn't
that
present
a
sort
of
a
anomalous
position
that
the
person
who
goes
the
whole
hog
and
more
is
going
to
end
up
in
a
better
position
than
the
individual
who
concedes
too
much
simply
to
get
the
patent
through.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
it's
still
the
case...
accepting
everything
you
say,
as
i
understand
your
position,
it's
still
the
case
that
when
the
pto
is
perhaps
asleep
at
the
switch
and
it
let's
a
claim
through
which
in
fact
is
broader
than
would
ultimately
prevail,
that
is
the
one
case
in
which
in
your
fallback
position
the
doctrine
of
substantial
equivalents
would
be
recognized,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
wouldn't
be
good
enough
for
you,
i
mean,
on
your
fallback
position.
that
would
not
be
recognized
in
that
case.
equivalents
would
not
be
recognized
in
that
case
on
your
view,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
left,
then,
for
the
jury
in
coming
to
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
infringement?
i
don't
see
that
anything
is
left.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and
on
the
reasoning
of
markman,
are
we
in
a
position
to
take
from
the
jury
the
ultimate
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
should
have
thought
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
question,
let's
say,
about
the
ph
level
in
fact
of
the
alleged
infringer's
process,
then
the
jury
verdict
would
be
a
pure
formality.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
story,
i
take
it,
is
authority
for
the
fact
that
it
always
was.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
it's
not
an
issue
that
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
would
you
concede
that
it
was
even
within
the
question
that
we
took?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
a
question
about
the
substance
of
the
doctrine.
