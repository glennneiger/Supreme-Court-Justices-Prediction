mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
last
april's
decision
in
markman
v.
westview,
this
court
recognized
that
the
scope
of
protection
afforded
by
a
patent
grant
is
defined
by
the
claim
or
claims,
yet
in
the
graver
tank
decision
in
1950
the
court
rightly
noted
that
outright
duplication
of
a
patented
invention
is
rare,
so
the
difficulty
that
the
courts
have
faced
over
the
years
is
how
to
protect
the
substance
of
the
claims
against
misappropriation
through
trivial
or
colorable
or
insubstantial
substitutions,
however
you
want
to
call
them,
without
depriving
the
public
of
the
notice
to
which
it's
entitled,
and
without
enlarging
the
claims
in
the
course
of
litigation,
that
is
the
dilemma.
and
it...
i
think
it's
helpful
also
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
the
statutory
policies.
how
can
inventors
be
given
adequate
incentive
to
make
the
disclosures
under
the
patent
system
that
contribute
to
the
advancement
of
science
and
technology
by
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we...
we
spoke
in
a
very
qualified
way
in
only
one
footnote
of
our
brief,
footnote
3,
to
that
because
the
markman
decision
was
pending
before
the
court
at
the
time
we
filed,
and
we
felt
that
that
would
shed
considerable
light
on
it.
and
in
light
of
markman,
which
has
now
held
that
it
is
exclusively
within
the
province
of
the
court
to
interpret
patent
claims
so
as
to
define,
so
as
to
define
the
patentee's
rights
against
literal
infringement,
it
really
would
be
incongruous
to
adopt
a
different
rule
to
define
the
rights
against
nonliteral
infringement.
to
the
extent
that
this
is,
and
we
think
it
is
to
a
great
extent
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
scope
of
the
claims,
it
is
similarly,
in
our
view,
a
matter
for
the
judge
to
do.
this
may--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
some
cases
there
will
not
be
anything
left
for
the
jury,
just
as
was
recognized
in
markman.
if
the
judge
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
depends
on
what
is
factually
disputed,
mr.
justice.
if,
for
example,
to
cite
a
very
simple
example,
the
judge
decides
based
on
evidence
as
to
the
proper
scope
of
protection
afforded
by
this
claim
that
a
ph
level
of
5
would
be
an
insubstantial
difference
that
is
within
the
scope
of
protection,
but
a
ph
level
of
4
would
require
the
opposite
conclusion,
and
there
were
a
factual
dispute
about
what
the
defendant
actually
did,
or
the
extent
to
which
it
did
one
or
the
other,
that,
of
course,
would
be
something
to
be
resolved
by
the
jury.
the
jury
would
still
have
to
decide
whether
the
conduct
engaged
in
by
the
defendant
infringed
upon
the
scope
of
protection
as
defined
by
the
judge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
true
under
markman
with
respect
to
literal
infringement,
also,
if--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
in
our
view
a
determination
for
the
court
to
make
in
defining
the
scope
of
protection
of
that
element
of
the
patent
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
the
equitable
origins
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
in
affording
a
remedy,
the
equitable
nature
of
it
is
relevant,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
recognize
that
the
doctrine
has
been
applied
in
what
used
to
be
considered
common
law
causes
of
action
for
damages
for
infringement,
which
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
these
are
the
reasons
why
i
stated
our
position
the
way
i
did,
that
this
is
largely
a
matter
of
claim
interpretation,
which
is
the
first
thing
we
said
in
that
footnote.
we
also
mentioned
the
equitable
nature
of
the
doctrine,
but
we're
not
saying
that
when
there
is
a
factual
dispute
about
what
the
alleged
infringer
did,
that
that
is
not
a
matter
for
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we...
our
position
is
at
the
time
of
infringement,
not
at
the...
not
at
the
time
of
trial,
but
not
at
the
time--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
patent
issued,
either.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because...
that's
right.
it
could
still
be
just
an
insubstantial
substitution.
we
give
an
example
in
our
brief
of
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
utility
of
the
doctrine
is
whether
somebody
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
act
that
infringes
is
misappropriating
what
the
patent
has
granted
to
the
patentee
to
assure
the
commercial
viability
of
his
invention
in
return
for
disclosing
it
to
the
public,
and
that
depends
on
what
someone
knowledgeable
in
the
state
of
the
art
would
recognize
to
be
a
substitution
at
the
time
that
the
infringement
occurs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
our
negotiations
we've
pointed
to
the
doctrine
as
developed
in
this
country,
and
so
far
as
i'm
aware
have
just
said
that
something
comparable
as
it
would
fit
within
your
particular
system
should
be
recognized
in
order
to
afford
the
protection,
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case,
the
brief
for
shearon
corporation,
cites
a
very
recent
decision
in
japan,
which
for
the
first
time
recognized
and
applied
a
doctrine
comparable
to
our
doctrine
of
equivalents,
but
it's
very
hard
to
equate
our
system,
that
involves
examination
in
the
patent
office,
with
other
systems
which
may
not.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
