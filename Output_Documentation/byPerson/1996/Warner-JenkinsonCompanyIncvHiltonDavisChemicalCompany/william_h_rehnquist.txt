well,
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-728,
warner-jenkinson
company,
inc.,
v.
hilton
davis
chemical
co.--
mr.
taranto.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
factual
inquiry,
mr.
taranto.
what
is
ph?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taranto,
on
your
fallback
position
where
you're
talking
about
the
pto
insisting
on
a
limit,
how
much
kind
of
analogy
to
legislative
history
are
we
letting
ourselves
in
for
there?
is
it
always
perfectly
clear
why
the
pto
does
what
it
does?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
always
find,
in
the
pto
history,
the
insistence
on
a
limit?
supposing
a
limit
is
ultimately
accepted
by
the
patent
applicant,
can
you
always
find
that
that
was
as
a
result
of
the
insistence
of
the
pto?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
that
do
to
graver
and
to
the
cases
that
it
relied
on,
going
way
back
into
the
19th
century?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
begin
to
talk
abut
a
case
on
its
facts,
that
always
suggests
that
you
either
want
to
limit
it
or
overrule
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
that
graver
should
be
limited?
i
mean,
it's
a
decision
of
this
court.
what
are
the
reasons
why
any
departure
from
it
at
all
should
take
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
decided
several
years
before
graver.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
schmit,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
agreed
a
moment
ago
that
it
needn't
be
decided
in
this
case
and
wasn't
even
included
in
the
question
presented.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes--
--do
you
think
that's
enough?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
judge
can
perform
that
task
simply
de
novo,
when
he
comes
to
considering
the
injunction?
if,
in
fact,
say
a
jury
has
found...
a
particular
way
the
judge
could
say,
well,
since
this
is
equitable
i'm
going
to
kind
of
disregard
that
finding
of
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schmit.
mr.
taranto,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
in
your
petition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
accused
product
or
process
is
outside
the
literal
scope
of
the
claim.
i
don't
see
where
it
refers
to
prosecution
history.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
the
case
is
submitted.
