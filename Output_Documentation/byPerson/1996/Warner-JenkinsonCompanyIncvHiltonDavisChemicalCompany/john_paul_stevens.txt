paul

mr.
taranto,
perhaps
i
should
ask
your
opponent
this
rather
than
you,
but
if
it
was
essential
that
there
be
a
lower
limit
on
the
ph,
how
can
it
be
that
the
injunction
takes
away
the
lower
limit
entirely,
if
i
read
it
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
see,
the
puzzling
thing
about
it
is,
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
think
5.0
is
equivalent
to
6.0.
justice
john
paul
stevens
makes
no...
but
then
the
district
court
seemed
to
think
0.0
would
also
be
equivalent.
is
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
fact
they
granted
that
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
talking
about
the
manganese
and
the...
and
disclosure
in
graver?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which,
of
course,
would
have
made
the
patent
invalid
if
it
had
been
exposed,
because
it
was
part
of
the
prior
art.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
they
never
answered
justice
douglas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr
wallace:
what
is
the
government's
position
with
regard...
i
assume
the
judge
is
going
to
make
the
decision
now.
does
the
equivalence
have
to
have
been
apparent
to
a
person
skilled
in
the
art
at
the
time
the
patent
issued
or
at
the
time
of
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
at
the
time
the
patent
issued,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
was
not
apparent
at
the
time
the
patent
issued,
it
nevertheless
could
become
equivalent
by
later...
because
of
later
learning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the
infringement
action...
say
you
have
continuing
development,
it
might
be
that
at
one
time
5
would
be
equivalent,
a
few
years
later,
4
might
be
equivalent,
and
then
today
you
could
have
no
lower
limit.
that
could
very
well
develop.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
government's
view,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wasn't
it
true
that
the
specifications
described
experiments
within
the
range
of
06--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
none
below
6?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
wanted
to
claim
as
much
as
they
possibly
can,
they
simply
should
have
said
zero
to
9.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
apparently
the
district
judge
agrees
with
you,
because
that's
what
the
injunction
requires,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
if
some
third
party
used
a
ph
down
to
1
or
2,
that
he
would
also
be
an
infringer
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
don't,
according
to
this
record.
isn't
that
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
didn't
know
it...
did
you
know
it
at
that
time,
or
the
time
of
the
infringement?
when
does
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
come
into
being?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
so
you
wouldn't...
you
didn't
necessarily
know
it
at
the
time
the
patent
issued.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
you...
if
you
had,
you
would
have
said
you
had
experimented
at
these
lower
levels,
presumably.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schmit,
isn't
it
true
that
in
fashioning
relief
in
an
infringement
case,
once
the...
there's
a
determination
whether
by
the
judge
or
jury
that
there's
been
infringement,
normally
the
judge
will
have
to
enter
an
injunction,
and
won't
he
then,
he
or
she
then
have
to
face
up
to
the
problem
of
what
is
the
permissible
boundary
line
which
the
infringer
may
no
longer
cross?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
before
the
case
is
over,
the
judge
is
going
to
have
to
perform
that
task.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
last
question?
we
talked
earlier
about
culpability
being
relevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
designing
around
a
patent?
is
that
a
plus
or
a
minus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
which
way
does
it
cut,
is
what
i'm
asking?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
whether
you're
saying
it's
a
plus
or
a
minus.
is
it
a
factor
that
favors
the
infringer,
or
favors
the
patentee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
irony
is,
he
tries
to
get
something
that's
commercially
useful
and
as
close
to
the
patent
as
is
lawful,
and
that's
designing
around
in
a
way.
in
another
way,
it's
copying.
i
mean,
the
line
between
the
two
is
kind
of
fuzzy.
