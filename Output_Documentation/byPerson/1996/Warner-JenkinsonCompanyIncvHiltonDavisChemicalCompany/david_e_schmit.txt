mr.
david
e.
schmit
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
respond
first
to
mr.
taranto's
argument
that
we
cannot
invoke
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
in
this
case
because
the
inventors
intentionally
surrendered
ph's
below
6.
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
we
find
one
peculiarity,
although
i
don't
think
this
court
has
spoken
on
the
question.
the
federal
circuit
has
found
that
this
doctrine
of
prosecution
history
estoppel,
the
intentional
surrender
of
claim
coverage,
is
a
question
of
law,
normally.
in
this
case,
however,
the
parties
agreed
to
submit
that
question
to
the
jury,
and
an
instruction
was
given
to
the
jury
on
prosecution
history
estoppel.
it
appears
on
page
60
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
essentially
asks
the
jury
to
consider
the
reasons
why
surrender
was
made,
if
surrender
were
made.
the
finding
of
fact
to
be
implied
from
the
jury's
verdict
of
infringement
is
that
there
was
no
such
surrender.
that
fact
having
been
established
by
the
jury,
and
now
having
been
reviewed
by
the
trial
court
in
the
posttrial
motions
and
by
the
federal
circuit,
i
suggest
creates
a
very
limited
scope
of
review.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
was
applicable
in
this
case,
because
of
surrender
of
patent
claim
coverage
that
had
been
made
before
the
united
states
patent
and
trademark
office,
and
in
the
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury,
the
trial
court
defined
what
prosecution
history
estoppel
was,
that
it
precludes
a
patent
owner
from
obtaining
a
claim
construction
through
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
that
would
resurrect
subject
matter
surrendered
during
prosecution
of
a
patent
application.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
but
in
this
case,
i
think
what
it
was
incumbent
upon
warner-jenkinson
to
show
was
that,
based
upon
the
written
record
in
the
patent
office,
there
was
a
clear
showing
that
hilton
davis
had
intended
to
and
in
fact
did
surrender
coverage
below
6.
the
only
evidence
we
have
in
the
written
record
of
the
patent
office
is
that
hilton
davis
was
attempting
to
distinguish
from
the
prior
art
that
showed
a
ph
above
9.
there
was
no
prior
art
that
was
before
the
patent
office
where
hilton
davis
had
in
our
view
to
show
a
ph
below
6.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
there's
no
evidence,
justice
scalia,
that
the
patent
examiner
ever
demanded
that
limit
be
put
in.
in
fact,
there's
no
evidence
why
that
limit
was
put
in
the
patent
office
record.
let
me
give
an
example.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
yes.
it
was
silent
on
anything
below
6--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--that's
correct,
but
there
was
no
indication
that
the
process
would
not
work
below
6.
i
think
there's
a
lot
of
case
law
that
says
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
patentee,
the
inventors
are
intending
to
claim
as
much
as
they
possibly
can.
that's
why
when
we
have
a
doctrine
of
prosecution
history
estoppel
we
require
clear
and
convincing
evidence--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--they...
they
should
have,
and
had
i
written
the
claim
today
knowing
what
i
know,
it
would
have
been
written
differently.
[laughter]
mr.
david
e.
schmit
what
we
learned
during
the
evidence
in
the
case
was,
outside
the
written
record
of
the
patent
office,
was
that
the
process
would
work
all
the
way
down
to
a
ph
of
2.
that
evidence
was
submitted
to
overcome
arguments
that
were
made
by
warner-jenkinson
that
there
is
supposed
tremendous
foaming
problems
below
6.
what
the
inventor
testified
to
was,
yes,
the
process
would
foam,
but
it
would
still
work
to
operate
to
purify
the
dye
all
the
way
down
to
2,
and
so
based
upon
that,
the
judge
entered
the
injunction.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
we
would
have
to
then
examine
whether
or
not
we
have
an
insubstantial
difference,
whether--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--well,
that's
what
the
judge
found
in
entering
the
injunction,
so
based
upon
the
facts
of
this
case
within
the
operation
of
this
particular
process,
a
ph
of
2
is
equivalent
to
a
ph
of
6.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
yes,
justice
o'connor.
that's
the
reissuing
statute.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
yes.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
the
statutory
scheme
for
a
reissuance
exists
to
correct
defects
in
patents
where
the
patent
owner
recognizes
there's
something
defective
in
the
patent,
either
because
they
have
misstated
something,
or
they
realized
they
didn't
claim
as
much
as
they
had--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--but
the
difference
in
reissuance
is,
it
permits
you
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
the
claim
within
the
2-year
statutory
period.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
operates
on
a
different
premise,
and
that
is
that
you're
not
enlarging
the
scope
of
the
claim.
all
you
are
doing
is
substituting
equivalents
for
what
you
have
literally
claimed.
let
me
provide
an
analogy.
synonyms.
we
have
a
word,
the
word
car.
we
have
synonyms
to
that
word,
automobile,
motorcar.
if
we
substitute
one
for
the
other,
we
aren't
enlarging
the
scope
of
the--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--and
if
we
are
to
have
the
doctrine
of
equivalents,
it
says
that
we
have
the
right
to
include
within
our
patent
not
only
that
which
we
have
expressly,
literally
claimed,
but
all
those
things
which
are
equivalent
because
of
insubstantial
differences.
in
this
case,
there
was
the
additional
issue--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--but
i
think
that's
the
very
reason
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
exists,
so
that
the
patent
owner
is
not
forced
to
only
have
as
coverage
and
to
be
protected
against
what
they
have
literally
claimed.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
yes.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
as
a
condition
of
the
grant,
yes.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
that's
correct,
and
if
we
look
at
the
rest
of
the
record
we
find
the
reason
that
the
examiner
was
suggesting
that
was--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--and
the
only
reason
that
we
could
learn
from
the
record,
the
written
record
for
that
type
of
amendment
was
to
avoid
ph's
above
9
that
were
in
the
prior
art.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
the
specification
did
disclose
6,
and
up
to
9,
but
the
question
here--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--what
the
claim
has
to
do
is,
it
has
to
enable
a
person
of
ordinary
skills
in
the
art
to
practice
the
invention,
that
what
this...
what
we
have
here
is,
the
examiner's
suggesting
that
6
be
put
in
to
be
absolutely
sure
that
that
enablement
requirement
was
met.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
but
if
we
look
at
the
rest
of
the
written
record
in
the
case,
we
find
that
the
only
reason
that
any
ph
limitation
was
being
put
in
was
to
avoid
the
prior
art.
they
had
to
provide
this
enablement
function.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
well--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--i
disagree
with
that
premise.
i
think
it's
basic
patent
law
that
the
claim
could
be
broader
than
the
specifications.
the
question
is,
have
you
taught
in
your
patent
enough
to
enable
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
to
practice
the
invention?
if
you
teach
them
6
will
work,
and
if
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
also
knows
that
5
will
work,
as
they
must
in
order
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
equivalents,
then
we
have
enablement.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
that's
entirely
correct.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
we
know
that
because
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
was
applied
in
this
case,
that
the
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--i
agree
with
the
government
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
should
apply--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--not
necessarily.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
for
whatever
reason,
it
wasn't
in
the
patent.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
i
think
we
apply
the
same
test.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
i
think
the
way
to
answer
that
is
to
say
that
when
the
client
asks
for
the
advice,
you
take
that
point
in
time
and
ask,
at
that
point
in
time,
is
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
f
equivalent
to
x.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
at
the
time
the
advice
is
being
sought.
tomorrow,
it
may
change,
but
at
least
as
of
the
point
in
time
that
we're
talking
about
right
now,
what
does
the
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
know
about
these
equivalents?
is
there
an
insubstantial
difference?
i'd
like
to
also
respond
to
mr....
to
my
colleague's
arguments
about
being
disclosed
in
the
patent.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
i
think
my
point
was
that
i
couldn't
find
that
this
court
had
spoken
on
it.
the
federal
circut
has,
and
has
said
it's
a
question
of
law,
and
that's
the
rule
that
we've
always
followed,
but
in
this
case,
because
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
then
we
treated
it
as
a
question.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
yes.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
i
don't
believe
so,
no.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
it
does
not
appear
to
be.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
the
question
went
more
to
the
existence
of
the
doctrine
we
quoted.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
the
requirement
of
being
disclosed
in
the
patent,
first,
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
is
an
objective
inquiry.
to
require
disclosure
in
the
patent
makes
it
into
a
subjective
inquiry,
what
does
the
patentee
know,
rather
than
what
the
person
who
has
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
know.
we
also
have
a
practical
problem.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
well,
that
is
the
entire
question,
the
culpability
of
the
alleged
infringer.
what
i
think
mr.
taranto
was
getting
at
was,
in
order
to
have
an
equivalent,
you
must
state
it
in
the
patent,
and
that's
what
i'm
disagreeing
with
at
this
point.
there
are
hundreds
of
thousand
of
issued
patents
that
are
still
active,
many
more
applications
which
have
been
filed,
which
cannot
now
be
amended
to
put
those
types
of
equivalent
in.
you
would
be
depriving
people
of
many,
many
expectations
that
they
would
be
protected
for
equivalents.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
what
i
think
graver
and
some
of
its
predecessors
tell
us,
it's
available
for
use
in
any
case
where
there's
no
literal
infringement,
but
there
are
limits.
one
of
the
limits
we've
talked
about
is
prosecution
history
estoppel.
there
is
another
limit
that
you
cannot
claim
equivalents
that
would
cause
you
to
read
on,
to
run
into
the
prior
art,
that
is,
to
invalidate
your
patent.
there
are
limitations
inherent
in
the
operation
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
itself.
only
insubstantial
changes
qualify.
i
might
analogize--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--yes,
in
the
context
of
this
process,
that's
true.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
all
right,
let
me
give
an
example--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--let
me
clarify
with
perhaps
an
example.
suppose...
a
soft
drink
has
a
ph
of
3.
water
has
a
ph
of
7.
they're
both
equally
applicable
to
quench
thirst,
irrespective
of
their
ph.
goldfish
wouldn't
thrive
very
well
at
a
ph
of
3
in
a
soft
drink,
but
would
in
water,
so
in
the
context
of
what
the
application
is,
in
the
context
of
the
invention,
a
ph
of
5,
or
a
ph
of
6
may
make
no
difference.
in
fact,
here
it
didn't.
another
context,
a
slight
change
of
ph
may
make
the
water--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--yes,
and
there
were
several
reasons
why
the
ph
had
some
importance
to
this
invention.
first,
it
had
to
lie
within
the
range
that
it
would
not
destroy
the
numbering
that
was
doing
the
filtering,
so
you
could
not
get
too
acid
or
too
alkyl.
secondly,
the
process
has
to
operate
within
a
certain
range,
or
else
you
end
up
with
a
product
that
is
so
acid,
a
dye,
or
so
alkaline
that
it
can't
be
used
as
a
practical
matter.
so
there
are
limits,
and
one
of
the
limits
is
9.
there
is
also
probably
a
lower
limit
that,
as
the
inventor
testified,
you
wouldn't
want
to
go
below
2
because
it
would
cause
the
membrane
to
be
eaten
up.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
i
think
as
long
as
we
have
questions
of
fact
and
law
and
scientific
inquiries
like
this
we're
going
to
have
that
problem,
which
brings
me
to
the
jury
question,
the
issue
really,
because
i
think
that
was
another
concern
that
my
colleague
had.
our
position
is--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--well,
the
word
jury
was
in
the
question.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
well,
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
i
would
just
state,
though,
i
think
markman
draws
the
line
between
what
is
for
the
court
and
what
is
for
the
jury.
on
one
side
of
the
line
we
have
claim
construction,
clearly
for
the
judge.
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
we
have
infringement,
clearly
for
the
jury.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
yes,
and
this
is
a
control
that
the
judge
could
exercise
over
just
how
far
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
can
go
in
fashioning
this--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--yes.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
i
don't
think
the
judge
can
do
that,
but
i
think,
like
what
happened
in
this
particular
case,
where
the
jury
came
back
with
a
finding
implied
that
a
ph
of
5
was
an
infringement,
and
the
judge
took
the
limit
all
the
way
down
to
2,
is
going
beyond
what
the
jury
did,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
ignore
a
factual
finding
by
the
jury.
in
markman,
the
line
that
was
drawn
was
between
the
construction
of
the
instrument
and
the
character
of
the
thing
invented,
and
this
court
quoted
from
the
bischoff
case
back
in
1869.
on
the
one
hand
we
have
construction
of
the
instrument.
the
character
of
the
invention
is
really
the
heart
of
the
invention,
as
you
stated
in
markman,
how
it
functions,
the
way
in
which
it
does
it,
the
result
that
it
gives.
that's
the
distinction
to
be
made.
in
real
typewriter,
which
was
talked
about
in
the
graver
case,
judge
learned
hand
said
that
a
patent
is
like
any
other
legal
instrument,
but
it's
peculiar
in
this,
that
after
all
aids
to
interpretation
have
been
exhausted
and
the
scope
of
the
claims
has
been
enlarged
as
far
as
the
words
can
be
stretched,
on
proper
occasions
the
court
may
make
them
cover
more
than
their
meaning
will
bear.
there
are
times
that
resort
to
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
that's
what
distinguishes,
i
think,
between
judge
and
between
jury.
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
i
submit,
i
think
is
more
vital
today
than
it's
ever
been.
there
was
a
time
when
an
inventor
could
go
out
in
the
barn
and
cobble
up
an
invention,
but
today
it
requires
so
much
expense
and
so
much
risk
by
companies,
particularly
in
the
biotechnology
area,
to
come
up
with
inventions
that
they
need
the
protection
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
affords,
and
i
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
federal
circuit,
who
sees
these
cases
every
day.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
yes.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
it's
a
factor
to
be
considered.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
what
the
federal
circuit
teaches
us,
as
implied
from
graver,
that
if
a
patentee...
if
an
accused
infringer
makes
an
attempt
to
design
around
the
patent
there
is
an
inference
to
be
drawn
by
the
trier
of
fact
that
they
have
attempted
to
incorporate
substantial
changes.
it's
merely
an
inference,
so
it's
merely
one
factor
that
can
be
considered
in
the
whole--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--it
favors
the
infringer
if--
mr.
david
e.
schmit
--they
make
the
attempt
to
design
around
it.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
that's
true.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
from
culpability
that
the
subjective
intent
of
the
infringer
should
be
a
factor.
this
is
an
objective
test,
and
whether
or
not
the
infringer
intended
to
infringe
or
did
not
intend
to
infringe
is
irrelevant,
as
i
think
colonial
oil
teaches.
mr.
david
e.
schmit
what
the
infringer
must
do
then
is
to
make
substantial
changes,
which
i
think
benefits
everybody,
because
now,
instead
of
little,
incremental
changes,
you
have
big
changes
in
technology,
and
i
think
that
benefits
everyone.
thank
you
very
much.
