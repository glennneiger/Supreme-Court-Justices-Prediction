mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
circuit's
ruling
should
be
reversed
because
it
violates
two
aspects
of
the
fundamental
principle
that
it
is
up
to
the
patentee
through
its
own
drafting
and
through
the
available
pto
processes
to
define
its
patent
boundaries
before
the
patent
issues,
not
later,
in
an
infringement
action.
our
narrower
point
is
that
once
hilton
davis
accepted
rather
than
appealed
from,
the
pto's
demand
that
it
write
the
specific
ph
limit
into
the
patent,
that
limit
became
binding
under
this
court's
doctrine
of
prosecution
history,
or
file
wrapper
estoppel.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
ph
is
a
measure
of
the
acidity
of
a
solution,
which
ordinarily--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--stands
for
the
potential
of
hydrogen,
so
that
wine
would
be
very
acidic,
water
not
at
all,
et
cetera.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it's
upside
down
that
way,
yes.
this
court's
doctrine
of
prosecution
history,
or
file
wrapper
estoppel
has
always
said,
in
a
way
unaffected
by
graver
tank,
that
there
should
be
no
second-guessing
of
the
reason
for
the
examiner's
demand
for
a
limit
once
the
patentee
has
accepted
that
demand
and
bypassed
the
appeal.
that
principle
states
a
critical
limit
on
any
otherwise
available
doctrine
of
equivalents,
and
itself
requires
reversal
here.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
think
that
the
fundamental
point
is
that
it's
in
the
pto
that
the
process
of
negotiating
about
proper
breadth
can
and
does
take
place.
if
someone
comes
in,
as
applicants
have
an
inherent
incentive
to
do,
and
seek
broader
coverage
because
it
gives
them
greater
rights
and
more
opportunity
to
exclude
the
world
from
something,
then
a
process
takes
place.
in
most
cases
the
examiner
will
reject
an
initial
application,
and
there
is
a
discussion
about
why.
here,
there
were,
i
think,
two
or
three
rejections
of
the
initial
application,
basically
because
of
the
obviousness
of
the
filtering
of
these
dyes.
but
then,
as
i
think
is
indicated
at
pages
103
and
107
of
the
joint
appendix,
as
hilton
davis'
description
of
its
interview
with
the
examiner
shows,
hilton
davis
went
into
the
examiner
and
the
examiner
said,
okay,
now
i'm
persuaded
that
if
your
ph
is
above
9,
it
won't
be
obvious
anymore.
but
it
also...
he
also
said,
make
sure
the
ph
is
above
6,
and
he
pointed
specifically
to
the
specification,
the
part
of
the
long
disclosure
that
says,
here's
where
we
say
what
we
know
works.
so
it
is,
in
fact,
apparent
in
this
record
why
the
examiner
said
6
as
the
lower
limit,
and
the
federal
circuit
just
missed
that.
now,
it
i
think
would
generally
be
true
that
a
patentee...
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
exactly
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
that's
right.
if--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
narrower
ground,
the
prosecution
history
estoppel
ground,
in
this
case
applies
only
where
there's
a
rejection
of
a
broader
claim,
or
a
claim
that
then
introduces
a
limit,
and
the
patent
applicant
has
bypassed
the
appeal
mechanism
for
challenging
that.
there
are
other
situations
where
there's
a
potential
estoppel
without
a
rejection
and
amendment
where
the
applicant
says
something
to
put
the
world
on
notice
that
he
interprets
his
claim
in
a
particular
way.
that's
not
this
case.
if
the
pto
is,
as
you
say,
asleep
at
the
switch--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that
equivalents
would
not
be
recognized?
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
would
be
okay
for--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--for
my
position.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right.
this
particular
case
involves
an
example
of
a
specific
demand
for
a
limit
written
into
the
patent
that
the
applicant
accepted,
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
congress'
having
insisted
that
the
right
way
to
challenge
those
limits
is
through
the
appeal
mechanism.
one
reason
is
that
it
make
sense
to
assume
that
the
pto
examiner
in
fact
had
a
good
reason
if
the
applicant
bypasses
the
appeal,
but
there
are
also
two
important
structural
advantages.
one
is
that
disputes
about
the
proper
flexibility
or
clarity
or
breadth
of
the
patent
are
resolved
before
it's
issued,
and
the
second
is
that
in
the
internal
appeal
mechanism
the
examiner
participates,
and
so
the
pto
can
clarify
whether...
can
clarify
the
reasons
for
the
rejection.
the
alternative
is
that
in
the
infringement
action,
where
the
pto
is
a
complete
stranger,
pto
isn't
there.
the
court
and
the
parties
are
let
to
speculate,
and
this
is
a--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right.
there
are
different
reasons
for
the...
for...
i
don't
think
the
pto
made
a
mistake
of
fact
at
all.
i
think
the
pto
got
it
exactly
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
oh,
the
federal
circuit
did,
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
there
are
two
different
reasons.
there's
one
reason
for
insisting
that
the
patent
come
down
no
longer
than
9,
and
another
reason
for
insisting
that
it
come
down
no
lower
than
6.
prior
art--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--higher
than
6.
prior
art
was
the
reason
to
say,
exclude
everything
above
9.
another
equally
important
reason
why
the
patent
would
have
been
invalid
if
it
had
been
below
6
is
that
a
claim
may
not
be
broader
than
the
specification
discloses
that
the
process
works.
you
look
at
this
specification,
in
which
hilton
davis
laid
out
all
the
experiments
it
had
done,
nowhere
does
it
show
how
to
make
its
process
work.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right.
i
think
that,
as
you
say,
that
would
be
a
hypothetical,
since
as
the
inventor
here
specifies--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right.
it
partly
depends
on
what
the
purpose
of
the
process
is.
if
the
purpose
of
the
process
is
not
just
to
filter
a
little
bit
of
solution
but
is,
as
the
inventor
testified
here,
the
whole
purpose
is
to
create
an
economical
way
of
doing
it
in
industrial
quantities,
then
foaming
problems
would
simply
not
serve
that...
would
defeat
that
purpose,
and
at
that
point
the
patent
wouldn't
be
useful
for
that
purpose.
but
what
the
examiner
and
the
applicant
would
be
discussing
in
that
situation
is
whether
the
utility
requirement
of
the
statute
is
met
in
those
conditions,
and
that
would...
i
don't
know
how
exactly
that
discussion
would
come
out,
but
our
point
is
that
that's
the
proper
place
for
the
discussions.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right.
i
was,
i
guess,
using
the
term
purpose
there
in
the
sense
of
function
from
the
language
of
function-way-result
that
has
often
been
used
as
the
touchstone
for
equivalents
analysis.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i'm
in
the
position
of
being
uncertain
exactly
what
does
make
a
difference.
i
mean,
the
function-way-result
test
has
often
been
said,
including
by
judge
hand,
as
just
another
way
of
stating
the
problem.
i
think
it
is
right
that
every
one
of
the
judges
in
the
federal
circuit
indicated
that
the
function-way-result
test
was
not
a
terribly
satisfactory
way
to
proceed,
and
the
basis--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right,
and
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i...
let
me
try
to
answer
that.
what
i
meant
to
say
is,
there
wouldn't
be
a
bar
on
getting
the
extra
range
just
because
it's
inefficient.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
requirements
for
patentability
are
met,
and
there
are
lots
of
patents
that
are
not
even
improvements
over
prior
things
or
particularly
efficient,
but
are
novel
and
nonobvious
and
useful
in
the
sense
of
the
statute,
so
efficiency
is
not
a
requirement.
if
hilton
davis
had
in
fact
thought
that
its
process
worked,
that
it
actually
performed
the
function
for
which
it
was
trying
to
get
the
patent,
it
surely
would
have
written
its
claim
to
include
that.
by
bypass--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
i
think
not,
and
i
think
that's
a
principal
reason
why
our
position
is
that
looking
behind
the
insistence
on
a
limit
for
the
reason
for
that
insistence
is
not
a
good
idea
in
an
infringement
action
because
it
often
will
not
be
clear--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
always
would
be
too
strong.
there
will
be
many,
many
cases
in
which
the
applicant...
you
have
the
original
application.
the
examiner
says,
i
reject
it
for
the
following
reasons,
and
writes
an
explanation,
so
that
the
task
of
interpreting
those
documents
to
see,
not
what
the
reason
for
the
rejection
is,
but
that
there
was
a
demand
in
order
to
obtain
the
patent
for
a
certain
limit
to
be
placed
in,
that
is
something
that,
like
other
kinds
of
textual
interpretation,
sometimes
will
generate
disputes
but
very
often
will
not,
as
here
it
did
not.
it's
another
thing
entirely
to
look
behind...
once
you've
concluded
the
pto
said
there
must
be
this
lower
limit,
there's
no
dispute
about
that,
to
then
second-guess
whether
the
pto
should
have
insisted
on
that
limited
by
reexamining
the
reasons,
and
what
happens,
i
think,
is
when
you
don't
have
the
pto
there
as
a
party,
which
you
would
in
the
internal
appeal
in
the
infringement
action,
you
have
mistakes
being
made.
the
federal
circuit
here
simply
ignored--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right,
it
does,
and
we've
scratched
our
heads
about
that
as
well.
one
of
the...
i
think
what
happened
as
a
factual
matter
is
that
independently
of
hilton
davis,
warner-jenkinson,
before
it
even
learned
of
the
patent,
figured
out
how
to
do
this
process
with
a
different
chemistry
that
made
it
able
to
use
a
lower
ph.
at
the
time
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that
it
makes
no
scientific
difference.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
what
the
district
court...
what
the
district
court
did,
yes.
now,
our
broader
point
is
that
in
fact
the
erasing
of
a
limit
that
was
imposed
in
the
pto
after
internal
correction
mechanisms
are
bypassed
is
really
only
the
most
extreme
application
of
the
federal
circuit's
broad
doctrine
of
equivalents,
which
suffers
from
the
same
basic
problem.
it
broadly
undermines
the
statute's
fundamental
decision
that
it
is
in
the
pto
that
patentees
are
supposed
to
define
their
asserted
inventions,
with
any
needed
breadth
and
flexibility
of
language
to
be
negotiated
there,
so
that
the
resulting
patent
has
boundaries
that
have
been
approved
by
the
pto
and
that
give
reliable
notice
of
the
monopolized
territory.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
let
me
talk
about
graver
in
particular.
i
think
that
the
principle
of
the
statute
can
be
summarized
as
a
principle
of
disclosure
through
approved
claims.
graver
did
not
depart
from
the
basic
requirement
of
disclosure,
that
somebody
sitting
down,
other
inventors
trying
to
work
in
the
same
field,
competitors,
by
reading
the
documents,
including
with
the
knowledge
of
skilled
people
who
understand
the
terms,
but
by
reading
the
documents
can
determine
where
the
boundaries
are,
because
in
graver,
there
was
actual
disclosure,
not
in
the
remaining
valid
claim,
but
both
in
the
broader
invalid
claim
and
in
the
specification
of
what
the
defendant
was
doing.
there
was
no
problem
there
either
of
bypassing
the
pto
process
of
approval,
or
of
not
disclosing
some
kind
of
equivalent
later
determined
in
court
to
be
scientifically
unimportant
in
its
change.
that
would...
seems
to
us,
is
the
basic
rule
that
ought
to
apply
in
limiting
any
doctrine
of
equivalents.
before
graver,
i
think
it
is
right
to
say
that,
with
one
arguable
exception,
this
court
had
not
expanded
any
patent
claims
for...
in
this
century,
and
that
graver
was
well
recognized
at
the
time
as
a...
an
anomaly
in
that
situation.
the
court
came...
entertained
the
notion
only
several
years
before
in
the
exhibit
supply
case
of
simply
repudiating
the
doctrine
as
fundamentally
incompatible
with
the
notion
of
a
claiming
system.
what
graver
does
say
is
that,
at
least
on
its
facts,
that
there
was
a
kind
of...
i
guess
graver
doesn't
say
this,
but
on
its
facts
it
was
a
kind
of
technical
impediment
to
a
proper
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
i
think
that
the
portion
of
graver
that
needn't
be
touched
at
all,
and
that
is
that
our
position
doesn't
affect
at
all,
is
the
requirement
that
if
there's
going
to
be
an
equivalent
so
as
to
expand
the
patent's
scope
beyond
the
understandable
meaning
of
the
claims,
then
it
can't
go
beyond
what
is
disclosed.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
manganese,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
that
wasn't
apparently
part
of
what
was
in
issue
in
this
court
at
the
time.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right,
and
then
the
case
did
continue
for
a
dozen
years
where
that
question
was
raised
again,
but
the
basic
requirement
that
the
patent
itself
somewhere
must
disclose
the
equivalent
is
entirely
consistent
with
graver.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
don't
think
that
a
departure
from
it
needs
to
take
place,
depending
on
how
broadly
one
reads
it.
graver
is
written,
i
think,
in
such
a
way
as
to
focus
on
a
host
of
facts
that
on
the
equities
there
seem
to
make
a
compelling
case
for
finding
infringement.
the
critical
facts,
we
suggest,
and
therefore
a
perfectly
familiar
way
of
reading
the
case,
is
as
limited
to
the
situation
where
the
patent
itself
disclosed
the
equivalent.
now,
as
for
a
broader
reading,
our
basic
position
is
that
a
broader
reading
is
inappropriate,
because
it
would
fundamentally
repudiate
the
long
line
of
authority
in
which
this
court
said
the
claims
define
the
reliable
boundaries
of
the
patent
monopoly.
and
if
it's
an
undisclosed
equivalent,
an
undisclosed
extension
of
the
patent,
something
that
a
reader
couldn't
determine,
only
an
experimenter
could
determine,
then
it
runs
smack
into
the
very
notion
of
invention
that
this
court
was
very
explicit
about
in
the
u.s.
industrial
chemicals
case,
which
we
discussed
in
our
reply
brief
and
this
court
relied
on
several
times
in
markman,
where
the
court
said,
it
doesn't
matter
if
all
the
scientists
agree
that
a
small
change
would
not
make
a
scientific
difference.
it
doesn't
even
matter
if
the
patentee
knew
that
that
small
change
would
not
make
a
scientific
difference.
the
patentee
didn't
say
so,
and
it's
only
what
the
patent
asserts
as
the
invention
that's
the
protected--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right,
but
graver
is
entirely
consistent
with
that,
and
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
graver
is
properly
read
as
consistent
with
that,
rather
than
a
broader
version
which
would
say
that
every
other
inventor,
every
competitor,
when
reading
the
patent,
has
not
only
to
understand
its
terms
to
know
where
the
boundary
lines
are,
but
also
has
to
undertake
experiments
to
see
whether
a
change,
a
ten-factor
change
of
the
ph
from
6
down
to
5
would
change
the
functioning
of
the
process.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
counsel
can't
foresee
everything,
but
the
patentees
themselves
have
a
number
of
protections.
one
is,
they
can
amend
their...
or
file
continuing
applications
while
the
original
application
is
pending
if
they
learn
more
doing
the
experiments.
section
102
of
the
statute
says
to
patentees,
even
if
you've
gotten
your
patent,
you
basically
have
a
1-year
risk-free
period
to
do
more
experimenting,
figure
out
if
you
would
expand
it,
and
during
that
1
year
your
patent
won't
be
used
as
essentially
prior
art
against
you.
you
can
then
go
back,
and
if
you've
done
something
new,
fine,
write
a
new
patent.
and
of
course
you
have
the
reissue
process,
which
congress
wrote
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
saying,
if
you
made
a
mistake
when
you
wrote
your
original
patent,
come
back
and
broaden
it,
but
subject
to
certain
conditions,
2
years,
and
others
who
are
using
the
same
thing
have
intervening
rights
protection.
what
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
does
in
its
broad
form
is
to
say
that
all
patents
are
subject
to
incourt
redefinition
through
scientific
testimony,
and
that
fundamentally
defeats
the
clear
notice
function
of
the
claiming
system.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
i
could
make
a
couple
of
quick
points,
the
estoppel
point
i
think,
set
out
at
page
28
and
29
of
our
petition,
is,
i
think,
widely
recognized
as
the
single
most
important
limit
in
defining
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
guess
i...
we
intended
it
to
be
in
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
said
whether
infringement
should
always
be
available
based
on
a
mere
finding
of
substantial
difference.
we
said
no,
and
the
first
primary
limit
we
suggested
was
prosecution
history
estoppel
as
part
of
28
and
29.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
it
is
28--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right,
it
did
not
use
that
label.
prosecution
history
estoppel
comes
up
only
when
you
have
a
defendant's
product
that
is
outside
the
literal
terms
of
the
patent,
otherwise
there's
nothing
to
estop,
otherwise
you
have
literal
infringement,
so
it
is
in
every
text
the
essential
limit
in
defining
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
the
important
thing
that
has
happened
now
to
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
is
that
it
has
become
the
rule,
rather
than
the
exception.
what
that
means
is
that
under
a
substantial
differences
standard
other
inventors,
who
often
do
make
important
incremental
changes
working
in
the
same
field,
don't
know
where
the
boundaries
are
that
they
can
work,
and
here
a
boundary
was
set
at
6.
the
examiner
explicitly,
at
page
107,
referring
to
10...
to
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix,
said,
the
reason
is
that's
all
that's
enabled
in
the
specification,
exactly
as
in
the...
in
all
of
this
court's
prior
cases.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
know,
and
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
there
are
two
fundamental
legal
disagreements.
the
federal
circuit
said,
we've
reexamined
the
reason,
and
then
it
said,
we
discount
all
reasons
except
prior
art.
those
are
legally
incorrect,
and
if
we
change
those
and
say
the
reason
doesn't
matter,
there
was
a
demand,
and
second,
that
even
if
you
do
look
at
the
reason,
invalidity
for
overbreadth
is
no
worse
than
prior
art.
