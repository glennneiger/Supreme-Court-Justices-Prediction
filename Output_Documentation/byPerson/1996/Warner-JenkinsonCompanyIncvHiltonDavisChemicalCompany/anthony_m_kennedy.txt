but
the
lower
the
ph,
the
higher
the
acidity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
that
kind
of
measure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
happen
if...
this
is
a
hypothetical
case,
not
this
case.
the
inventor
says,
below
6
it
works
but
not
very
well.
you
get
a
lot
of
foaming,
and
the
result
isn't
quite
as
good.
you
really
shouldn't
be
playing
around
below
6
or
you're
not
going
to
get
a
very
good
result.
what
should
the
patent
disclose
in
that
case?
and
let's
presume
further
that
an
infringer
still
saves
money
if
he
uses
the
process
under...
an
alleged
infringer
still
saves
money
if
he
goes
under
6
rather
than
does
the
salting
method.
it's
much
better
than
salting,
but
it
isn't
as
good
as
6
and
9.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's...
this
is
a
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
if
you
don't
have
the
equivalents
doctrine,
then,
in
the
example
that
you
and
i
have
just
discussed
you
have
to
do
one
of
two
things,
limit
your
patent
to
the
most
efficient
range,
or
(b)...
and
suffer
infringers,
and
suffer
alleged
infringers,
or
(b)
expand
the
patent
to
an
inefficient
zone.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
the
equivalents
doctrine
protects
against
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
assume,
mr.
wallace,
that
there
should
be
a
doctrine
of
equivalents,
and
that
the
ph
5
procedure
here
probably
should
qualify
under
it,
what
should
be
the
division
of
function
between
the
judge
and
the
jury?
what
should
have
happened
here
in
the
trial
court,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
then,
the
court
should
have...
or
could
have
instructed
the
jury,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
i
instruct
you
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
process
when
used
at
level
5
is
within
the
scope
of
the
patent
under
the
equivalents
doctrine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
can
answer
justice
stevens
question
yes,
that
you
put
in
6
because
you
knew
it
would
work
at
that
level,
and
you
weren't
sure
it
would
work
below,
and
still
not
surrender
your
position.
