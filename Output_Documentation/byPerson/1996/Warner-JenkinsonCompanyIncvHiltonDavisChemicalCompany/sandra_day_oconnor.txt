well,
why--
--mr.--
--why
didn't
the
patentee,
hilton
davis
here,
use
the
statutory
scheme
for
a
subsequent
amendment
of
the
scope
of
the
patent
if
that's
the
position
it
wanted
to
take.
there
is
a
statutory
provision
that
enables
a
patent
applicant
who's
given
a
patent
to
come
back
in
requesting
an
enlargement
of
the
scope.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
if
that
isn't
done,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
the
use
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents
to
cover
something
like
that
questionable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
this
case.
they
now
want
to
assert
something
they
didn't
claim,
which
is
a
ph
below
6.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it's
very
different
here,
where
there's
been
a
specified
range
of
the
ph,
and
hilton
davis
wants
to
claim
that
something
that
isn't
within
that
scope
is
nonetheless
protected.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
very
hard
to
conclude
that
it's
insubstantial
when
it's
outside
the
limits
that
the
patent
owner
has
agreed
to
have.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
we
have
no
room
within
the
doctrine
for
looking
at
the
culpability
of
the
alleged
infringer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
other
hand,
there
ought
to
be
some
reasonable
limitation
to
its
use,
so
that
it
isn't
dredged
up
in
every
single
infringement
case,
and
as
appears
to
be
the
case
today.
