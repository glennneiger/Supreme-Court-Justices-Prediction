justice
antonin
scalia
higher
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
proper
use
of
purpose?
i
mean,
you
mean
there
are
two
different
purposes?
if
one
purpose
is
to
filter
efficiently
and
another
purpose
is
to
filter
inefficiently,
do
you
get
a
separate
patent
for
filtering
inefficiently?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
both
patents
have
the
same
purpose,
namely,
of
filtering?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
mean
that.
you
think
that
for
equivalents
analysis
it
would
make
a
difference
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
we
can
still
reverse
that
if
there's
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
patent
examiner
demanded
that
they
not
go
below
6.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schmit--
justice
antonin
scalia
--before
we
get
by
the
argument
prior
to
the
equivalents
argument,
namely
whether
there
was
a
waiver,
you
say
that
the
record
discloses...
does
not
disclose
that
the
examiner
demanded
that
6
be
the
level?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
look
at
page
107
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
the
patentee's
record
of
interview,
and
it
says
the
examiner
stated
that
on
presentation
of
such
arguments,
namely
the
arguments
that
had
been
made
above
showing
four
major
points
of
difference,
coupled
with
an
amendment
in
claim
1
inserting
the
ph
range
from
6
to
9.
in
accordance
with
the
specification
disclosure
at
page
12,
and
i
gather
the
specification
disclosure
was
the
reason
he
picked
6,
he
would
reconsider
his
rejection
as
based
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
wasn't
suggesting
it.
he
said
he...
this
is
the
only
basis
on
which
he
said
he
would
reconsider
it,
namely,
you
insert
a
range
from
6
to
9.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
the
specification
disclosure?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
what
he
was
basing
it
on,
and
doesn't
the
patent
have
to
comply
with
the
specification?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
saying
he
suggests
it
be
put
in.
his
only
agreement
to
reconsider
has
as
one
of
its
conditions
inserting
the
ph
range
from
6
to
9.
i
mean,
you
can
call
it
a
suggestion
if
you
like,
so
long
as
you
say
he
suggests
that
unless
you
do
that
he
won't
reconsider
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
other
side
said
there's
another
reason,
that
is,
that
the
specification
has
to
comply
with
the
patent.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
specification
here
was
only
6
and
above.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever
the
reason
was,
at
least
he
says
it
has
to
be
from
6
to
9.
now,
your
argument
is,
well,
he
had
no
reason
for
the
6.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
a
reason
for
the
9,
no
reason
for
the
6,
and
therefore
we
can
disregard
the
6.
that
requires
whoever's
conducting
this
to
not
only
see
what
he
said,
but
go
further
back
into
the
history
and
see
the
reasons
for
what
he
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
like
history.
i'm
not
inclined
to--
[laughter]
--want
to
go
any
further
back
than
i
have
to.
but
isn't
it
true,
there
is
a
reason
for
the
6,
and
that
is,
isn't
the
patent
supposed
to
teach
the
person
who
wants
to
read
and
figure
out
how
this
thing
will
work?
isn't
there
an
implied
representation
in
the
patent
that
the
device
will
work,
and
if
you
don't
know
whether
it
will
work
below
6
or
9,
you
can't
make
that
representation,
and
you
didn't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
insubstantial
you
define
as
a
tenfold
reduction
in
the
acidity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
sounds
substantial.
that
sounds
substantial
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
ph
was
central
enough
to
the
invention
that
it
was
specified.
i
mean,
you
know,
when
i'm
drinking
water
or
coke
i
don't
specify
what
the
ph
is,
but
it
was
central
enough
to
the
invention
here
that
it
was
specified
in
the
patent.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
really
wasn't
in
the
questions
presented.
i
mean,
that's
the
major
problem
i
have
with
that
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's
no
disagreement
on
the
estoppel
history
question,
as
in
the
abstract.
the
way
you
assert...
it's
presented
here,
both
sides
agree
there's
such
a
thing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
estoppel
history.
they
just
disagree
as
to
whether
such
estoppel
occurred
here.
