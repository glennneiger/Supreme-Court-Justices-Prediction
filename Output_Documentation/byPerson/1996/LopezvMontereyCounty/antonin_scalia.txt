justice

scalia
well,
but
if
it
is
the
state
statute
that
is
the
operative
law,
i
think
it's
just
not
a
case
where
the
voting
rights
act
applied.
surely
you
wouldn't
make
the
argument
if
it
was
the
other
way
around,
if
the
county
ordinance
mentioned
by
reference
some
state
law,
and
then
applied...
applied
the
same
rule
as
a
matter
of
county
law.
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
fact
that
it
referred
to
state
law
lets
the
county
off
the
hook.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
know
why
it
works
the
other
way
here.
this
is
state
law
we're
talking
about.
the
state
isn't
a
covered
unit.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
but
you
have
to
add
one
fact
to
it,
extend
the
terms
of
judges
elected
under
a
plan
that
the
court
believes
may
be
unconstitutional.
i
mean,
the
court
was
concerned
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
plan
under
which
the
judges
currently
sitting
were
elected,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that...
that's
quite
a
significant
factor
as
to
whether
a
realistic
option
is
to
let
those
terms
continue.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
court
have
the
power
to
impose
any
of
these
remedial
alternatives
on
its
own
without
first
making
the
determination
that
the
extant
plan,
which
would
otherwise
continue,
was
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that's--
--that's
not
the
court's
problem.
that's
not--
--that's
the
jurisdiction's
problem.
all
the
court
has
to
say
is,
this
hasn't
been
precleared,
period,
whereupon
it's
the
problem
of
the
jurisdiction
to
decide
what
they're
going
to
do
with
these
judges,
continue
them
or
come
up
with
some
other
plan,
but
i
don't
know
why
it's
the
court's
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
after
a
finding
of
violation.
that's
a
remedy
after
finding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean
a
violation
that
the
extant...
you
know,
the
system
in
place,
which
someone
is
asking
to
be
stricken
down,
is
a
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
case,
none.
i
mean,
nobody
was
challenging
any
particular
plan
here.
they
were
just
challenging
the
preclearance.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
is
that
relevant,
because
the
state
might
not
have
made
this
disposition
with
respect
to
this
county
if
it
had
known
that
it
was
under
attack?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i'm
trying
to
connect
that
to
the
lack
of
due
diligence
that
you
were
referring
to.
