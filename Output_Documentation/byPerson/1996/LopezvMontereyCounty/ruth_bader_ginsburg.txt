are
there
such
counties
in
california
where
you
have...
unlike
this
county
that
now
has
just
one
district,
are
there
counties
in
california
that
have
multiple
judicial
districts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
state
law
that
we're
dealing
with
that
ratified
or
approved
the
consolidations
is
not
part
of
a
statewide
plan.
it's
just
peculiar
to
this
one
covered
county,
is
that
not
right?
i
mean,
that
law
that
deals
with
the
consolidation
is
not
like
the
constitutional
provisions
that
are
also
in
this
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
to
the
extent
that
california
approved
what
had
been
done
by
the
county,
that's
peculiar
to
this
one
covered
county.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
jenkins,
isn't
the
problem
that
this
isn't
a
status
quo
ante?
right.
i
mean,
if
we
were
going
back
to
what
it
was
when
they
had
the
district...
whatever,
the
municipal
districts
and
the
justice
districts.
but
here,
it's
not
that
we
go
back
to
what
was
and
keep
it.
there
is
in...
practically
for
every
point
of
view
you
can't
return.
you
can't
go
back
to
that
old
way,
so
there
has
to
be
a
different
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
rather
confusing
case--
--i
don't
understand
this.
--and
i
think
we're
getting
confused
about
what
is
the
old
status
quo.
i
mean,
nobody
suggested
that
the
old
system
with
the
justice
courts
was
unconstitutional.
the
question
is,
when
they
changed
from
that,
was
that
in
violation
of
section
5.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
it
involved
courts
that
no
longer
exist
in
the
whole
state
of
california,
for
one
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
situation
of
the
district
judge?
the
fact
that
this
wasn't
precleared,
the
district
court
bears
some
responsibility
for
that,
because
the
district
judge
kept
insisting,
i
want
you
to
come
up
with
a
plan
that
satisfies
federal
law
and
state
law.
both
parties
said
they
couldn't,
so
the
district
judge
really
had
something
to
do
with
why
we
have
no
precleared
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stone,
when
did
that
become...
would
you
just
describe
to
us,
when
did
that
become
california's
position,
because...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this...
i
thought
that
california
had
itself
sought
to
preclear
changes
that
would
affect...
changes
in
state
legislation
that
would
affect
covered
counties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
state
has
sought
such
preclearance
when
its
enactments
affect...
will
make
a
change
in
a
covered
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
that
california
has
acted
out
of
an
excess
of
caution,
is
that
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
not
on...
based
on
its
understanding
of
the
law
that
it
was
required
to
seek
preclearance
when
state
law
changes
voting
in
a
covered
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose...
let's
suppose
the
d.c.
circuit
finds
you
can't
have
this
change
because
it's
retrogressive.
then
what?
if
that's
what
the
d.c.
circuit
finds,
how
can
you
counter
the
retrogression...
retrogression
necessarily
involves
race...
without
saying,
i
have
to
remedy
that
impact
on
race?
that's
what
i
don't
follow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
never
even
have
empowered
the
right
decisionmaker,
because
it's
been
frozen
in...
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
district
court
within
the
ninth
circuit
that
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
make
that
retrogression
determination.
