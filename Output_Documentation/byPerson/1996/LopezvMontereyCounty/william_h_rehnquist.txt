justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1201,
vicky
lopez
v.
monterey
county.
mr.
avila,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're...
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
know
that
section
5
necessarily
applies
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
fact
this
is
basically
a
state
statute,
and
monterey,
the
state
of
california
isn't
covered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
the
state
law
authorized
but
didn't
require
consolidation,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
avila.
mr.
jenkins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank,
you,
mr.
jenkins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stone,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
stipulate,
mr.
stone,
was
there
what
you
would
think
of
as
a
technical
stipulation
filed
in
the
district
court
which
stated
what
you
said
it
stated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
parties...
they
stipulated
that
they
couldn't
bear
the
burden
of
proof
of
proving
that
they
were
not
retrogressive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
here,
mr.
stone,
is
that
you
are
satisfied
with
the
november
1995
interlocutory
injunction,
and
you
ask
that
the
district
court's
judgment
be
affirmed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
should
reverse
the
november
1995
order,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
approval
of
the
december
1994
order,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stone.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
avila,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
avila.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-1201,
lopez
against
monterey
county
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
