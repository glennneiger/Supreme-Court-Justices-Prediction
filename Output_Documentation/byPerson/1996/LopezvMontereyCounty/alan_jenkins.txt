mr.
alan
jenkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
county's
electoral
system
contained
voting
changes
covered
by
section
5
that
had
never
received
preclearance.
this
court's
precedents
clearly
require
the
district
court
to
enjoin
elections
under
that
plan.
as
the
court's
questions
have
indicated,
first
and
foremost,
a
so-called
local
three-judge
court's
task
is
to
determine
whether
changes
are
subject
to
preclearance,
have
been
precleared
and,
if
not,
to
enjoin
elections
under
an
unprecleared
plan.
justice
breyer,
in
response
to
your
question,
it
has
been
frequently
the
case
that
the
status
quo
ante
was
an
unconstitutional
or
otherwise
unlawful
plan.
for
instance,
when
congress
enacted
the
voting
rights
act,
it
understood
that
a
lot
of
the
plans
currently
in
effect
would
be
unconstitutional
either
under
the
fifteenth
or
fourteenth
amendment,
one-person-one-vote
violations
and
what-have-you,
and
that
for
section
5
purposes
they
could
still
serve
as
the
benchmark.
that--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
our
contention
is
not
that
the
district
court
necessarily
erred
in
rejecting
a
particular
plan,
but
that
the
option
that
it
chose
of
allowing
elections
to
go
forward
under
an
unprecleared
plan
was
impermissible
under
this
court's
decisions.
we
do
think
that
the
district
court
had
some
remedial
alternatives,
some
flexibility
in
determining
what
to
do,
but
that
the
course
that
it
took
was
an
unlawful
choice.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
your
honor,
clearly,
i
think
if
the
district
court
had
done
the
full-blown
miller
v.
johnson
analysis,
determined
that
the
1994
interim
plan
was
unconstitutional--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--right,
and
if
the
only
other
choice
was,
if
i
understand
your
question,
allowing
elections
under
an
unprecleared
plan--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--then
i
think
elections
would
have
to
go
forward
under
the
unprecleared
plan.
if
the
constitution
were
to
come
into
direct
conflict
with
enforcement
of
section
5,
that
would
affect
the
outcome,
but
i
think
that's
quite
far
afield
from
the
situation
that's
presented
here,
as--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--i
think
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
but
as
i
understood
the
hypothetical,
the
only
two
choices
were
an
election
under
an
unprecleared
plan--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--or
an
election
under
an
unconstitutional
plan.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
that's
certainly
correct
under
the
situation
that
was
actually
presented
in
this
case.
there
were
a
number
of
alternatives.
one
alternative
could
have
been
simply
to
prevent
elections
from
going
forward
and
to
order
that
incumbent
judges
remain
in
their
posts
pending
preclearance
of
a
permanent
change.
we
don't
know
that
the
1994
interim
plan
was
in
fact
unconstitutional.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
think
that...
pardon
me.
mr.
alan
jenkins
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
if
i
can
be
clear,
there
was
a
system
that
existed
on
november
1st,
1968,
which
has
not
been
claimed
to
be
unconstitutional,
but
which
the
district
court
thought
would
be
difficult
or
unfeasible
to
return
to.
mr.
alan
jenkins
that's
correct,
but
i
think
before
allowing
elections
under
an
unprecleared
system
the
district
court
was
required,
among
other
things,
to
analyze
whether
that
system,
the
preexisting
'68
system,
could
have
been
adapted
in
some
way
to
accommodate
current
circumstances.
we
think
there
were
a
number
of
remedial
alternatives
that
were
possibilities,
as
justice
breyer
says,
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
we
think
so,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
the
1994
interim
plan
was
a
one-time
plan,
and
the
elections
had
already
been
conducted
under
that
plan,
so
there
was
a
question
as
to
what
would
be
the
further
relief
that
would
be
ordered
so
long
as
no
pre...
permanent
plan
had
been
precleared,
but
i
think
the
local
court
had
jurisdiction
to
make
that
consideration.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
justice
souter,
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
would
not
have
been
objectionable
for
the
district
court
to
simply
say,
no
further
elections,
and
judges
that
were
elected
either
under
the
unprecleared
plan
that
existed
or
under
the
interim
plan
will
simply
remain
in
their
posts.
mr.
alan
jenkins
well,
i
think
under
certain--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
ordinarily
that
would
be
correct,
and
i
agree
with
you
that
in
order
to
resolve
this
case,
and
to
order
the
outcome
that
the
appellants
seek,
that's
all
this
court
would
have
to
decide.
my
point
is
simply
that
there
was
a
difficult
circumstance
presented
to
the
district
court
here
because
of
the
jurisdiction's
failure
to
obtain
preclearance,
and
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
an
indefinite
period
in
which
no
elections--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
justice
scalia,
in
city
of
rome
this
court
held
that
in
fact
the
fallback
remedy
essentially
under
section
5
is
elections
under
the
status
quo
ante
system,
and
as
justice
gins--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
there
was
a
finding
of
a
violation
here,
which
was
the
failure
to
preclear
an
election
system
that
was
covered
by
section
5,
so
there
was
in
fact
a
violation.
if
i...
there
was
not--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--are
you
referring
to
the
1994
interim
plan,
or
are
you...
which
one
are
you
referring--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
i'd
like
to
leave
it
with
the
fact
that
i
think,
justice
souter,
you're
correct
that
this
court
need
not
address
that
question
in
order
to
reverse
the
decision.
if
i
could
address
briefly
the
question
of--
mr.
alan
jenkins
--well,
your
honor,
that's
true,
and
what
i
was
about
to
address
was
the
question
of
state
law,
and
i
think
justice
souter
in
his
earlier
comment
was
quite
correct
that
section
5
covers
attempts
to
enact
or
administer
voting
changes
within
the
covered
jurisdiction.
this
court
in
the
sheffield
case
held
that
section
5
coverage
is
territorial,
and
that
state
laws
as
well
as
local
laws
cannot
be
enforced
within
the
jurisdiction
as
to
preclearance.
mr.
alan
jenkins
thank
you.
