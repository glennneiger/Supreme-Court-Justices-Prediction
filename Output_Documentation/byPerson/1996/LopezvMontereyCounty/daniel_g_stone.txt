mr.
daniel
g.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
questions
posed
to
mr.
jenkins
and
mr.
avila
suggest
what
the
state
would
have
suggested
independently,
which
is
that
the
context
of
this
proceeding
is
a
very
important
focus
as
well
as
the
scope
of
a
covered
jurisdiction
once
it's
determined,
by
virtue
of
the
statutory
formula,
that
a
jurisdiction
must
seek
preclearance
of
voting
changes.
the
nature
of
this
case,
as
justice
souter
has
suggested,
is
a
complaint
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
it's
called
a
coverage
case
under
section
5,
and
the
only
inquiry
in
these
cases
is
whether
there
is
a
covered
jurisdiction,
if
so,
whether
that
jurisdiction
is
enacting
or
seeking
to
administer
a
new
change
which
it
has
initiated
affecting
voting
rights,
and
then
the
third
question
is,
did
they
first
obtain
the
requisite
preclearance?
so
in
that
sense...
in
our
briefs
we
use
the
word
technical.
i
understand
that
that's
a
confusing,
perhaps
a
misnomer,
but
it
is
a
procedural
question
of
whether
or
not
they've
done
the
requisite
steps
to
get
federal
approval
before
implementing
something
that
a
covered
jurisdiction
has
initiated.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
that
is
the
common
remedy.
it's
a
declaration
that--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--nothing
more.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
certainly
on
this
complaint.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
in
clark
v.
roemer
this
court
very
strongly
suggested
that
that
may
be
the
case.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
in
most
cases
the
elections
must
be
enjoined.
this
court--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
for
several
reasons
we
don't
believe
the
elections
should
have
been
enjoined
here.
under
clark
v.
roemer
this
court
said
that
there
may
be
extraordinary
circumstances
in
which
an
injunction
would
not
be
appropriate,
and
it
gave
an
example,
which
is
one
in
which
the
action
was
filed
at
the
eleventh
hour,
the
election
processes
were
already
well-advanced,
and
that
there
were
equitable
reasons
why
the
elections
should
be
permitted
to
go
forward.
here,
the
complaint
was
filed
in
1991,
and
it
was
challenging
1968
through
1983
ordinances.
in
clark
the
court
made
the
point
that
there
was
no
showing
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
diligent.
here,
i
suggest
that
quite
the
opposite
fact
is
true.
furthermore,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
there
have
been
intervening
state
actions.
the
state
is
not
a
covered
jurisdiction,
and
the
state
has...
for
one
thing,
the
people
through
an
initiative
measure
have
eliminated
justice
courts
altogether.
the
state
has
also
enacted
statutes,
particularly
government
code
section
73560,
which
state
as
a
matter
of
state
law
what
the
municipal
court
district
is
in
monterey
county,
and--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--yes.
the
state...
the
state
is
not--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
i
believe
that...
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
addresses
informal
as
opposed
to
formal
actions
by
a
covered
jurisdiction.
the
covered
jurisdiction
may
initiate
by
promulgating
a
regulation
if
it's
a
county--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--exactly.
there's
always
the
remedy,
and
several
members
of
this
court
have
suggested
this,
there's
always
the
remedy
of
proceeding
under
section
2,
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
if
it--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
with
respect,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
it
defeats
the
purpose
of
section
5.
section--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
i
agree
with
that,
too.
i
just
took
from
the
tone
of
the
question--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
of
course
there
is.
the
citizens
within
the
covered
jurisdiction
are
still
protected
against
any
action
of
that
identified
jurisdiction,
but
the
fact
that
another
governmental
entity
has
made
some
change
within
its
sovereign
power
that
has
some
effect
upon
voting
rights--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--it's
true
that
the
secretary
of
state's
office
for
the
state
of
california
does
submit
on
occasion...
i
don't
think
it's
absolutely
every
time,
but
it
does
submit
regularly
state
statutes
and
enactments
for
preclearance,
but
this
court
has
never
held,
and
it's
been
our
position
throughout
this
case,
to
answer
your
question,
that
the
state
is
not
a
covered
jurisdiction,
and
therefore
its
enactments
do
not
require
preclearance.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
it
has,
your
honor.
the
court
is
probably
aware--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--that
is
exactly
what
has
happened,
and
also--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--there's
a
department
of
justice
regulation...
i
believe
it's
section
51.23
of
28
code
of
federal
regulations...
which
suggests
that
states
have
that
requirement,
and
in
an
abundance
of
caution
the
secretary
of
state's
office
has,
as
a
general
matter,
attempted
to
obtain
preclearance,
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
such
preclearance
is
required
of
an
uncovered
jurisdiction,
and
i
would
suggest
that
it's
a
very
grave
incursion
into
principles
of
federalism
to
do
so.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
the--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--yes.
it's
various
consolidation
ordinances--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--no.
state
law
permitted
the
counties
to
adopt--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--no,
although
there's
some
confusion
on
the
record
in
that
respect.
the
county
through
its
counsel
in
its
initial
motion
to
dismiss
early
on
in
the
case,
before
we
were
involved
at
all,
indicated
that
it
required
legislative
permission
in
advance,
and
the--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--i
think
that's
right,
that
the
legislative--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--no,
i
believe
they
are,
justice
o'connor,
because
we...
the
state
is
now,
as
you
know,
a
defendant
party.
it
was
made
a
party
for
the
first
time
as
part
of
the
order
that's
now
on
appeal
here,
and
we
have
argued
that
because
the
countywide
elections
are
conducted
pursuant
to
state
law,
that
there's
no
place
for
a
section
5
proceeding
here,
the
reason
being
that
when
the
court
in
south
carolina--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--oh,
i
see,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
i
misunderstood
your
question.
at
the
time
the
ordinances
were
passed,
the
county
had
the
discretion--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--to
design
the
district--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--but
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
there
was
on
the
books
a
state
statute
indicating
that
the
monterey
county
municipal
court
district
is
the
entirety
of
monterey
county...
that's
section
73560
of
the
government
code...
and
there
was
this
change
in
the
state's
constitution,
article
vi,
section
5,
which
said
that
there
may
no
longer
be
statewide--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--no,
but
the
point
is--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--that
at
the
time
they
filed
it,
20
years
after
the
first
of
these
ordinances,
things
had
changed
considerably,
and
the
state
during
that
intervening
period
had
dictated
what
the
monterey
county
municipal
justice--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--because--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--our
arguments
go
to
whether
preclearance
is
required.
they
go
first
of
all
to
whether
a
statute
enacted
by
a
jurisdiction
that
has
not
come
within
the
covered
formula
is
nevertheless
subject
to
preclearance--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--right.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
the
issue
is
still
open
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court's
order
that
is
under
appeal
here
specifically
says,
now
that
the
state
has
been
made
a
defendant
on
this
day,
november
1,
1995,
it
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
raise
defenses--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--your
honor,
that
would
have
been
fine.
we
would
dispute
that
an
injunction
should
be
put
into
effect
until
the
court
is
certain
that
there
is
in
fact
a
preclearance
requirement
that
was
not
met.
that
remains
an
open
question.
as
the
court
said
in
its
november
order,
the
state
may
have
this
case
dismissed
on
the
basis
that
preclearance
is
not
required.
but
your
point,
your
honor,
about
the
status
quo
is
very
important,
because
had
the
plaintiffs
and
the
department
of
justice
been
content
to
have
an
injunction
preventing
these
countywide
elections
pending
preclearance,
that
would
have
been
fine.
that
would
have
been
what
clark
says
to
do.
they
instead
urged
the
court,
and
the
court
ultimately
did
their
bidding,
to
fashion
a
new
order,
a
remedial
order.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
we
cannot.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
no.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
this
proceeding
is
simply
to
determine
whether
an
enactment
is
subject
to
preclearance.
preclearance
encompasses
not
just
enactments
that
harm
minority
voting
rights,
it
encompasses
neutral
enactments,
and
it
encompasses
enactments
that
greatly
enhance
minority
rights.
any
of
those
kinds
of
actions
have
to
be
precleared
before
they
can
be
implemented,
so
at
this
point
the
mere
fact
that
the
court
found
that
this
consolidation
had
to
be
precleared
says
nothing
about
whether
there's
any
substantive
harm.
and
because
there's
no
substantive
harm
yet
proven
or
established
and
because,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
there's
no
constitutional
or
section
2
challenge
filed,
there's
no
parallel
case,
as
there
was
in
allen
and
clark
and
morse,
where
the
constitutionality
of
the
practices
are
being
challenged,
there
is...
the
court
has
no
basis
upon
which
to
fashion
any
remedial
order.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
yes.
they
stipulated
that
they
were
unable
to--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
i'm
not
sure
it
does,
justice
stevens,
because
the
district
court...
this
court
has
held,
in
defining
the
different
kinds
of
actions
that
may
be
brought
under
the
voting
rights
act,
it
has
specifically
said
that
a
coverage
case
such
as
this,
where
the
only
question
was
coverage,
has
no
jurisdiction
to
determine
either
retrogression,
which
is
expressly
limited
to
the
district
of
columbia
courts,
or
constitutional
violations.
they
are
all
beside
the
point.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
as
part
of
these
interim
orders
that
they
urged
the
court
to
order,
to
direct,
the
parties
stipulated...
not
the
state,
certainly,
but
the
parties
then
existing,
stipulated
that
the
county
was
unable
to
establish
that
the
ordinances,
that
several
of
the
ordinances,
it
wasn't
specific,
were
not
retrogressive
in
that
they
may
have
had--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--yes,
of
proving
that
several
of
them
were
not,
and
that
was
all
they
stipulated.
there
was
no...
normally
in
the
district
of
columbia
court,
if
there's
a
determination
of
retrogression
the
court
gives
some
guidance
about
what
it
is
that's
a
problem,
and
perhaps
how
it
can
be
remedied.
here,
we
don't
know
which,
if
any
consolidated--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--that
is
irrelevant,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
yes.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
yes.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
and
that's
the
normal
remedy.
i
believe
that's
what
this
court
said
in--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--absent
extraordinary
circumstances
that
seems
to
be
the
limits
of
this
coverage
case
court's
remedial
authority.
now,
here
in
particular,
we
would
argue
that
the
court
did
not
need
to
enjoin
then.
for
one
thing,
as
we
say,
the
question
of
whether
preclearance
was
required
is
now
reopened,
because
the
state
is
now
a
defendant,
and
can
argue
that
the
state
is
not
subject
to
preclearance,
and
that
these
elections
are
conducted
pursuant
to
state
law
at
this
late
date.
secondly,
that
clark
says
that
there
may
be
extraordinary
circumstances
which
could
come
into
play.
as
we
pointed
out,
there
was
no
diligence
here.
the
process...
not
in
the
sense
that
it
was
at
the
eleventh
hour
and
that
primaries
were
going
to
be
held
the
next
day,
but
in
the
sense
that
the
state
has,
since
these
ordinances,
dictated
how
municipal
court
elections
shall
be
conducted,
those
have
come
to
play.
secondly,--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--no.
it's
relevant
because
a
noncovered
jurisdiction
has
some
substantial
say
if
not
dispositive
say
in
the
elections
as
they're--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
it's
the
fact
that
they
waited
20
years,
permitted
a
great
deal
of
time
in
which
the
state
took
several
actions
with
respect
to
justice
and
municipal
courts
in
monterey
county,
so
their
diligence...
had
they
filed
this
action
immediately
after
passage
of
the
first
ordinance,
or
the
second,
or
the
third,
and
taken
issue
with
it
at
the
time,
then
an
injunction
would
have
been
against
the
county,
i
suppose,
at
least
much
more
clearly.
now,
the
state
has
developed
law,
including
the
initiative
voted
by
the
entire
population
of
the
state,
to
eliminate
justice
courts,
and
that
is
in
the
midst...
one
point
to
be
made
about
how
much
the
state
is
involved
here
is
to
look
at
the
remedy
which
they
have
sought
here.
they
didn't
seek
an
injunction
that
would
put
the
status
quo...
that
is,
the
1968
system...
back
in
effect.
they
sought
an
affirmative
remedial
order
by
the
court
which,
among
other
things,
annulled
or
suspended
state
laws.
it
annulled
or
suspended--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--actually,
your
honor,
the
state
interest
is
not
in
having
countywide
jurisdiction.
mr.
avila
was
correct
that
there
are
municipal
courts
that
are
less
than
county,
but
the
underlying
state
interest
is
very
much
that
every
voting
citizen
within
a
judicial
district
is
entitled
to
vote
for
the
judges
of
that
district,
and
that
was
thrown
out
the
window
by
the
interim
plan.
similarly,
there's
a
state
interest,
constitutional
in
nature,
that
no
city
shall
be
split
in
a
municipal
court
district.
that
was
thrown
out
the
window.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
but
that's
even
worse,
your
honor,
than
dividing
it
into--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--yes,
and
we
of
course
disagree
to
the
extent
that
it
belittled
the
state's
interest.
but
the
point
is,
there
are
constitutional...
constitutional
provisions
that
were
in
existence
before
even
monterey
county
became
a
covered
jurisdiction.
these
are
1966,
the
most
recent
enactments
of
article
vi,
section
5,
and
article
vi,
section
16.
they're
1966.
even
if
the
state
were
a
covered
jurisdiction,
a
coverage
question
would
have
to
find
that
those
enactments
are
not
subject--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--that...
yes,
justice
stevens,
that
in
combination
with
the
fact
that
the
interim
remedy...
and
i
always
put
it
in
quotes...
was
issued
in
the
first
place,
because
i
believe
that
miller--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
that's
correct,
on
the
basis
that
it
was...
substantial
questions
about
its--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--constitutionality
came
into
play.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
the
court
didn't
say
there
was
a
miller
violation.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
but
i
don't
see
how
it
could
come
to
any
other
conclusion,
your
honor.
but
let
me
say
that
the
mix...
what
we've
been
talking
about
is
a
normal
section
5
coverage
case
where
the
only
question
is
whether
a
statute
enactment
or
informal
something
that
a
covered
jurisdiction
seeks
to
administer
requires
preclearance
and
hasn't
yet
had
it.
but
when
the
court
decided...
it
was
very
ill-advised,
we
believe
beyond
its
jurisdiction,
but
it
decided
to
redesign,
reconfigure
the
county
court
system
in
monterey
and
to
suspend
or
annual
state
laws
and
state
constitutional
provisions.
it
then
had
another
order.
that
changed
the
mix
entirely,
and
we
submit
that
the
court
then
had
jurisdiction
to
correct
its
own
error,
to
eliminate
this
unconstitutional
or
substantially
unconstitutional
order
and
to
put
things
back
where
they
were.
the
court
was
trying
to
return
to
the
status
quo.
that's
why
we
believe
it
ordered
that
there
be
a
one-time
countywide
election,
because
when
the
case
first
came
to
this
court
the
judges
on
the
monterey
county
municipal
court
had
been
elected
countywide.
the
court
changed
that.
it
changed
it
in
a
race-based
fashion
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
do
and
the
court's
november
order
points
out,
we
don't
accept
the
retrogression
stipulation,
meaning
we
now
recognize
that
that's
not
our
domain,
it's
for
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
we're
not
the
section
2
court,
meaning
all
these
stipulations--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--the
district
court
did
say
that
miller
draws
into
question
whether
any
reliance
on
race
may
be
invalid,
but
it
didn't
go
that
far.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
your
honor,
i
think
the
sentence
that
the
court...
that
you're
citing
in
the
court's
decision
is
certainly
subject
to
some
scrutiny
and
clarification,
but
that
was
not
necessary
to
the
court's
decision
here.
in
normal
cases,
including
miller
and
shaw,
the
court
asks
about
the
constitutionality
of
districting
in
a
context
where
districting
is
the
normal
procedure,
and
there
are
normal
districting
principles...
the
decennial
reapportionments,
for
instance.
in
this
case,
the
traditional
districting
principle
as
far
as
dividing
any
judicial
district
in
california
is,
we
don't
do
it.
we
do
not
do
it.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
yes.
my
point
is
that
the
traditional
districting
principles,
as
that
phrase
is
normally
used
in
decennial
reapportionments,
doesn't
apply
here.
the
districting
principles
that
apply
here...
districts
are
designed
for
administrative
convenience
in
the
justice
courts,
so
the
notion
of
it,
maybe...
maybe
in
a
hearing
they
could
prove
that
it
was
contiguous,
so
what?
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
except,
your
honor,
that
i
think
the
court's
most
recent
order,
the
november
order,
was
an
attempt
to
correct
what
it
had
unfortunately
messed
up
initially.
the
court
should
not
have
issued
the
december
1994
order,
which
injected
race,
divided
the
county,
it
gave
10
percent
of
the
voters
within
a
judicial
district
the
right
and
power
to
elect
a
judge
that
is
sitting
over
the
whole
district--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
but
that
would
then
be
the
status
quo,
as
the
court
has
used
it.
that
would
be
what
was
left.
that's
the
trouble.
the
court's
effort
was
to
correct
that
and
bring
things
back
the
way
they
were
initially.
i
think
that
was
laudable.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
the
court
has
not
expressly
stated
that
it's
remedy,
its
'94
remedy
was
unconstitutional,
but
as
i
started
to
point
out,
the
only
purpose
for
the
dividing
of
this
district
was
race.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
and
at
this
point
it
would
be
moot,
except
for
the
extension
of
terms,
because
the
court
was
obviously
uncomfortable
with
its
remedy
in
the
first
place.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
no,
it
would,
because
the
court
has
extended
the
terms.
but
the
court--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
when
the
court
held
its
hearing
on
miller,
that
was
the
question
it
wanted
to
address--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
although
in
the
meantime
the
results
of
that
unconstitutional--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--yes.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
but
on
the
same
token,
on
these
facts
this
court
it
seems
to
me
could
very
quickly
and
easily
find
that
under
miller,
that--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
actually,
i
did
submit
a
map
which
shows
that
there's
no--
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
--well,
the
principal
reason
that
you
know
miller
should
annul
this
interim
remedy
of
december
'94
is
the
point
made
by
justice
o'connor
that
no
substantive
harm
to
voting
rights
has
been
established,
so
any
remedy
that
brings
race
in
at
all,
any
remedy
at
all
is
inappropriate
in
this
court.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
that's...
it
would
be
a
very
different
case
if
this
were
in
the
district
court
and
if
retrogression,
a
substantive
violation
had
been
determined.
then
the
court
would
have
options.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
well,
it's
correct
that
it
hasn't
yet
gotten
to
any
court
in
which
substantive
harm
can
be
determined.
mr.
daniel
g.
stone
thank
you.
