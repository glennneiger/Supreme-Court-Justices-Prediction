justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
actually
disagreeing?
i
thought
your
position
is,
they
have
to
preclear,
they
didn't,
and
under
clark,
what
a
district
court
is
supposed
to
when
they
don't
preclear
is
say,
hold
everything.
nothing
happens.
no
election,
no
nothing
until
you
go
and
preclear.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
isn't
that
what
you
want
to
happen
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
saying
he
didn't
do
that,
but
under
clark,
he
should
have
done
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
do
you
know
in
your
study
of
this...
it
seems
to
me
over
the
last
30
or
40
years
it
probably
has
come
up
before
that
some
covered
district
had
in
place
a
plan
that
arguably
is
unconstitutional.
then,
they
changed
it,
and
the
change
has
to
be
precleared,
but
under
clark,
you
just
keep
the
status
quo
until
they
preclear
it,
even
if
that
status
quo
is
arguably
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
has
that
situation
ever
come
up
before,
because
that
would
be
a
relevant
precedent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
even
if
that
status
quo--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
don't
go
back
to
it.
you
just
say,
that's
it.
everything
else
is
frozen.
now,
is
there
instances
where
you
can
think
of
in
your
experience
or
research
where
maybe
that
status
quo
was
arguably
unconstitutional,
but
still
we
want
the
d.c.
circuit
deciding
these
things,
not
every
district
court
in
the
country.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
you
give
this
sort
of
absolute
answer
rather
than
it
depending
on
circumstances.
i
mean,
it
might
be
the
case
that
the
status
quo
ante
was
arguably
unconstitutional.
the
judge
has
to
decide
whether
to
keep
that
while
they
go
run
and
preclear,
or
produce
a
new
interim
plan.
suppose
the
only
interim
plan
that
he's
presented
with
is,
give
the
state
just
what
it
wants.
then
his
choice
is,
we
give
the
state
just
what
it
wants,
or
we
proceed
under
the
old
status
quo,
which
was
arguably
unconstitutional.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
whether...
which
is
which.
isn't
it
rather
fact-specific,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--circumstance-specific?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
why
doesn't
that
go
to
the
merits?
i
mean,
what
i
can't
understand
about
this
case
is
why
has
it
taken
5
years?
you
didn't
preclude
that...
preclear
the
initial
matter,
so
you
have
to
preclear
it.
so
why
doesn't
the
state
go
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
they
would
make
their
argument,
which
says
because
of
all
the
factors
you
bring
up,
that
these
single...
this
single
unity
and
the
change
in
all
the
judges
does
not
abridge
anyone's
right.
it
does
not
have
the
effect
to
abridge
rights
to
vote
on
the
grounds
of
race,
and
they
would
argue
because
of
the
change
in
the
single
district,
member
district,
it
does.
and
then
we
would
have
the
d.c.
circuit
decide
all
this,
take
into
account
your
arguments,
which
are
excellent,
and
their
arguments,
which
are
excellent,
and
then
we
would
get
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
state
does
abridge--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--rights
on
the
basis
of
race
under
the
circumstances
that
you
outline
in
your
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
if
you
disagree
that
it's
not
subject
to
preclearance--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
don't
you
appeal,
the
district
court's
judges
to
the
contrary,
to
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
isn't
it
up
to
the
district
court
under
ordinary
precedent
to
enjoin
all
elections
until
it
decides
that
matter,
at
which
point,
if
you
lose
you
will
have
to
go
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
if
you
win,
you
won't.
but
clark
says
this
is
an
ordinary
kind
of
thing.
when
one
side
says
it
is
precleared,
the
other
doesn't,
you
keep
the
status
quo,
freeze
everything,
until
the
district
court
decides,
and
it
should
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
can
we
say
bygones
are
bygones--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--whatever
happened
in
the
past,
now
proceed
according
to
clark?
