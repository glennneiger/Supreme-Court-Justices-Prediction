justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
not
agree
that
your
position
would
be
different
if,
instead
of
the
district
judge...
instead
of
saying,
well,
i
think
there
may
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection
under
miller
and
so
forth,
if
the
judge
had
held
a
hearing
and
found
that
the
plan
in
effect
was
unconstitutional,
then
we'd
have
a
different
case,
wouldn't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
he
did
not
do
that,
but
they
just
sort
of
assumed
it
might
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
changes
by
the
county
pursuant
to
state
law,
even
if
required
by
state
law,
need
not
be
precleared?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you
respond
to
the
"or
administer"
language
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
your
view,
even
if
monterey
county
was
covered,
if
the
state
legislature
enacted
a
whole
bunch
of
changes,
it
completely
redesigned
the
jurisdiction
in
ways
that
were
retrogressive,
there'd
be
no...
no
federal
remedy
except
under
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
quite
true?
isn't
it
true
that
the
county,
when
it
dismissed
its
objection
in
the
d.c.
circuit
action,
in
effect
stipulated
that
they
could
not
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
retrogression?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
at
least
gives
the
district
court
a
colorable
basis
for
assuming
their
ought
to
be
some
interim
remedy
until
they
get
preclearance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
also
relevant
that
the
interim
remedy
put
into
effect
in
december
of
1994
was
precleared?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
interim
remedy
did
accommodate
the
state
interest
in
having
countywide
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
they
were
trying
to
accommodate
some
of
the
state
interest
in
the
particular
remedy
they
selected,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
only
for
election
purposes,
not
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
the
interim
remedy
is
countywide
for
jurisdictional
purposes
as
opposed
to
election
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
almost
as
bad
as
letting
a
judge
be
assigned
to
another
district.
it's
almost
that
bad.
at
least
that's
what
the
district
court
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stone,
can
i
interrupt
your
presentation
for
one
moment,
because
i
understand
you're
making
arguments
that
really
haven't
been
decided
on
by
the
district
court.
to
what
extent
does
your
position
rest
on
the
reason
given
by
the
district
court
for
the
action
that's
being
challenged,
namely
that
it
was
concerned
that
miller,
which
was
decided
some
6
months
after
the
interim
remedy
went
into
effect,
cast
constitutional
doubt
on
the
interim
remedy?
is
that
essential
to...
do
you
think
that
that
reason
was
acceptable?
let
me
put
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
why
the
district
court
set
its
own
remedy
aside.
they
set
it
aside
entirely,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
basis
of
miller.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
question
is,
do
you
think
that
was
a
proper
way
to
decide
that
issue
without
first
deciding
whether
there
was
a
miller
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
you
think
that
the
reason
the
district
judge
thought
miller
invalidated
the
plan,
or
its
interim
plan,
was
because
the
district
judge
thought
that
any
reliance
on
race
in
fashioning
the
districting
would
be
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
do
you
think
it's
up
to
us
to
decide
whether
the
district
court
correctly
or
incorrectly
construed
miller?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
be
free
to
advance
all
the
arguments
you've
been
making
here,
including
the
unconstitutionality
of
that
remedy,
because
those
haven't
really
been
ruled
on.
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
know.
if
that
establishes
unconstitutional,
it's
an
easy
issue
to
decide.
surely
he'll
set
aside
the
order
if
it's
unconstitutional,
but
he
just
hasn't
so
held,
or
they
haven't
so
held...
there
are
three
judges...
i
should
say.
i
think
i'm
right
on
that.
you
still
can
make
the
argument.
you
still
may
win
on
this
very
ground,
but
that
ruling
has
not
yet
been
made.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
even
have
a
map
in
the
record,
i
don't
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
couldn't
find
it.
i--
[laughter]
mr.
stone--
--i
assume
one
of
the
lawyers
said
it
was
based
on
race,
but--
--how
is
the
miller
question
even
ripe
if
we
don't
know
whether
the
change
needs
to
be
precleared,
and
we
don't
know
the
view
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
d.c.
circuit
whether
there's
any
retrogression
involved
in
the
countywide
system?
how
do
you
even
get
to
the
miller,
which
would
be
something
else
in
place
of
the
system
that's
been
found
retrogressive?
