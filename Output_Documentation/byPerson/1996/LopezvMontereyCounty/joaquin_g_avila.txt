mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
is
whether
a
district
court
having
enjoined
an
unprecleared
plan
can
then
order
that
unprecleared
plan
into
effect.
the
resolution
of
this
issue
is
controlled
by
clark
v.
roemer.
there,
the
court
unanimously
held
that
an
election
based
upon
unprecleared
election
changes
must
be
enjoined.
here,
the
district
court
ignored
clark,
suspended
the
operation
of
section
5,
and
ordered
the
implementation
of
the
unprecleared
plan.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
it
does
apply.
there
can
be
no
serious
dispute
that
section
5
applies
to
judicial
elections
in
monterey
county.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
we
are
dealing
with
county
ordinances
which
have
consolidated
judicial
districts
starting
back
in
1969,
the
date
after
monterey
county
was
made
subject
to
the
section
5
preclearance
provisions.
the
applicable
state
statutes
refer
and
incorporate
the
consolidations
that
occurred
at
the
county
level,
so
we
had
a
series
of
county
ordinances...
in
fact,
a
total
of
about
11...
that
started
out
with
two
municipal
court
districts
and
seven
justice
of
the
peace
court
districts
on
november
1st
of
1968,
and
ultimately
it
winded
up
with
a
countywide
election
system
in
1983,
and
so--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
well,
at
this
particular
point,
there
are
still--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--yes.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
although
we
are
dealing
with
state
statute,
we
are
also
dealing
with
county
ordinances
and
a
consolidations
of
judicial
districts
that
occurred
over
a
period
of
time.
section
5
requires
the
county
ordinances
as
well
as
the
state
statutes
that
specifically
refer
to
events
or
consolidations
of
the
judicial
districts
in
monterey
county,
and
these
state
statutes
specifically
referred
to
monterey
county.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--the
reason
why
it
doesn't
work
is
because
here,
monterey
county
has
the
authority
to
consolidate
judicial
districts,
and
it
exercised
that
authority
under
state
law,
and
so
as
a
result
of
those
consolidations,
there
were
changes
which
had
to
be
precleared
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
even
though
you
may
have
had
a
state
statute
that
implicated
those
consolidations,
it
nevertheless
specifically
referred
to
the
consolidations
in
monterey
county,
and
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
a
series
of
county
ordinances
which
the
district
court
back
in
1993
found
had
not
been
precleared
and
could
not
be
implemented,
and
until
those
particular
county
ordinances
are
approved,
the
state
statutes,
which
are
dependent
and
interrelated
with
those
county
ordinances,
can't
come
into
effect.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
it
could,
but
it
didn't
in
this
particular
case,
and
when
we
look
at,
say
for
example--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--the
state
laws
that
are
under
review
in
this
particular
case
did
not.
the
1983
state
statute
was
contingent
upon
the
consolidations
of
three
judicial
districts
in
monterey
county,
and
so
it
specifically
referred
to
this
event
that
was
going
to
occur
in
monterey--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that
is--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that
is
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
under
the
state
laws
that
are
under
review,
are
not...
they
were
not
mandated.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that
is
correct.
now,
the
only...
this,
of
course,
is
just
not
merely
a
failure
to
preclear.
we
also
have
a
situation
here
where,
after
the
district
court
found
these
ordinances
subject
to
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
monterey
county
then
filed
a
section
5
judicial
declaratory
judgment
action
in
washington,
d.c.,
and
subsequent
to
that
filing,
we
intervened,
and
as
a
result
of
that
intervention,
as
a
result
of
discussion
with
the
department
of
justice,
monterey
county
decided
that
it
could
not
meet
its
burden
of
demonstrating
that
several
of
these
county
ordinances
did
not
have
a
retrogressive
effect.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
it
did.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that
is
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
if
you
have
a
state
statute
that
enables
the
county
to
take
a
particular
course
of
action--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that's
correct,
it
would.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
the
1983
state
statute
was
in
essence
based
on
a
contingency
of
consolidation
of
three
judicial
districts
which
the
county
board
of
supervisors
at
that
point
authorized,
and
duly
adopted
an
ordinance
consolidating
these
three
judicial
districts,
but--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--it
was
not
free
under
state
law
to
go
back
to
the
status
quo
ante,
and
the
reason
why
is
because
the
justice
of
the
peace
courts
were
eliminated
in
1993
under
a
state
proposition,
and
at
the
time
of
1968,
there
were
two
municipal
court
districts
and
seven
justice
of
the
court...
justice
of
the
peace
court
districts,
and
to
go
back
to
that
procedure
was
deemed
to
be
unfeasible
by
the
district
court,
and
for
that
reason
the
district
court
found
it
compelling
to
issue
an
order
to
require
an
election
based
on
an
interim
plan
for
the
june
1995
election.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
under
the
state
statutes
and
the
constitution,
state
constitution,
you
could
have
a
countywide
municipal
court
district.
along...
in
addition
to
that,
you
could
also
have
municipal
court
districts,
several
municipal
court
districts
within
the
county
as
long
as
they
met
certain
criteria,
as
long
as
they
didn't
divide
municipalities,
as
long
as
they
contained
over
40,000--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--there
are
some
counties
in
california
that
do
have
multiple
court
judicial
districts.
for
example,
los
angeles
county,
alameda
county,
san
diego
county.
many
of
the
large
urban
areas
have
multiple
municipal
court
districts,
and
monterey
county,
back
in
1968,
did
in
fact
have
two--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that's
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
the
state
statute
specifically
refers
to
monterey
county.
it
auth...
the
state
constitutional
provision
authorizes
the
legislature
to
create
countywide
municipal
court
districts,
to
create
multiple
municipal
court
districts
if
so
desired.
in
fact,
in
some
of
these
counties
you
have...
in
san
diego
county,
for
example,
you
have
a
municipal
court
district
that
in
fact
divides
municipal
boundaries,
so
there
are
various
variations
that
are
permitted
under
state
law.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
clear
error.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
precisely
our
point.
if
the
court
reverses
the
district
court
refusal
to
enjoin
its
unprecleared
election
change,
then
on
remand,
the
district
court
would
then
be
required
to
conduct
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
what
alternative
should
be
implemented,
because
it
can't
go
back
to
the--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--yes.
that
was
one--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--that...
no.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
there
were
other
alternatives
that
the
district
court
could
have
explored.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
well--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--well,
for
one
thing
the
district
court
could
have
continued
to
extend
the
terms
in
order
to
permit
the
state--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--well,
in
this
particular
case
the
district
court
did...
after
the
issuance
of
this
court's
stay
did
extend
the
terms
until
further
order
of
the
district
court
and
further
order
of
this
court.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
ordinarily
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
well,
there
was
ample
opportunity
that
was
provided
to
the
district
court
in
order
to
resolve
and
address
that
question.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that
is--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--at
this
point,
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
the
reason
why
at
some
point...
maybe
not
at
this
particular
juncture,
but
the
reason
why
we're
here
is
because
there
hasn't
been
preclearance
since
1969,
and
the
state
and
the
county
have
not
come
forward
with
a
proposed
solution
since
1993.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
correct,
and
i--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--and
at
a
minimum
we
wanted
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
so
that
we
could
present
various
alternatives
and
the
district
court
could
then
determine
whether
in
fact
the
1994
was
unconstitutional,
but
that's
not
the
issue
here.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
i
think
it's
very
important
to
point
out
that
the
plan
that
we're
talking
about
is
the
1994
precleared
plan,
which
was
a
proposed
plan
that
was
submitted
by
the
appellants
and
the
county
to
try
to
resolve
this
litigation.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
and
it
is
that
plan
that
the
district
court
felt
that
after
this
court's
decision
in
miller
raised
constitutional
concerns.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
right.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
that's
correct.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
well,
the
typical
procedure
is
to
go
back
to
the
status
quo,
and
you
cannot
challenge--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--yes,
you
can--
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
--well,
in
the...
the
10-year
litigation
that
occurred
in
the
conner
v.
johnson,
connor
v.
waller,
which
started
off
as
a
one-person-one-vote
violation,
which
there
was
established,
in
fact,
a
violation,
and
subsequent
court
proceedings
dealt
with
the
remedial
issues,
and
that
would
be
the
precedent
that
i
would
cite.
i
would
like
to
at
this
time
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joaquin
g.
avila
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
conner
v.
waller
as
providing
authority
for
the
issuance
of
injunctive
relief
and
additional
relief
beyond
merely
the
issuance
of
a
permanent
injunction.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
at
least
in,
previously
in
this
court
in
shaw
the
state
is
not
entirely
covered
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
and
only
federal
counties,
but
yet
when
the
state
enacts
a
redistricting
plan
that
affects
those
counties,
those
plans
that
directly
affect
those
counties
have
to
be
precleared.
and
with
respect
to
the
remedy
we
are
urging
this
court
to
reverse
the
district
court's
use
of
the
unprecleared
election
change,
and
so
that
the
court
can
then
conduct
whatever
evidentiary
hearing
needs
to
be
conducted
in
order
to
determine
what
should
be
the
appropriate
remedy,
and
the
reason
why
we
have
to
go
beyond
the
injunction
is
because
there
has
been...
we
have
to
correct
the
previous
effects
of
elections
that
were
conducted
under
an
unprecleared
election
system,
and
that
was
what
the
temporary
plan
did.
we
have
election
systems
since
1968,
up
to
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed,
conducted
under
an
unprecleared
election
system.
