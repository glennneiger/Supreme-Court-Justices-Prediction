justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
county
free,
after
the
enactment
of
the
state
statute
and
after
consolidating,
to
go
back
to
the
preconsolidation
regime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
was
also
true
that
there
was
a
state
statute
that
required
countywide
courts,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
there
also
a
statute,
a
state
statute
that
requires
that
the
courts
be
countywide,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
we--
--well,
suppose
there
are
two
choices,
neither
of
which
involves
returning
to
the
status
quo.
suppose
you
cannot
return
to
the
status
quo.
one
is
to
order
preclearance,
and
the
other
is
to
require
elections
under
an
unconstitutional
plan
based
on
race.
which
of
those
do
you
take?
which
is
the
lesser
evil?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
that
was
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
hold
everything
means
enjoin
any
further
elections.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
should
have
happened
here,
in
your
view?
could
the
court
simply
say,
i
make
a
finding,
a
declaration
that
there
has
been
no
preclearance,
and
that
there
should
be
no
preclearance,
and
stop
there,
or
must
he
further
enjoin
elections
under
the
unprecleared
plan?
