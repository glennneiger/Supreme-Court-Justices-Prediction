justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
guess
you
stipulated
with
the
county
that
it
is
impossible
to
prepare
an
election
plan
that
doesn't
conflict
with
state
law
and
still
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
how
do
you
avoid
challenging
california
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
do
you
do
that
under
section
5?
i
mean,
it's
a
very
confusing
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
really
would
appreciate
your
addressing
this
inquiry
that
the
chief
justice
also
inquired
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.--
--did
state
law
require
monterey
county
to
consolidate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean
it
either
does
or
it
doesn't.
i'm
just
not
clear
whether
state
law
requires
consolidation
of
these
local
judicial
offices.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
take
the
position
that
the
county,
monterey
county
was
free
to
consolidate
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
challenged
here
was
monterey
county's
decision
to
consolidate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
was
not
mandated,
according
to
you,
by
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
has
never
been
a
determination
that
there
is
a
substantive
violation
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
withdrew
that
suit,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
dropped
the
suit,
and
so
that
leaves
us
in
a
posture,
as
of
now,
there's
been
no
finding
of
a
substantive
violation
of
section
5.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
possible
that
the
only
thing
before
the
court
at
the
time
it
acted
was
the
allegation
that
no
preclearance
had
been
obtained,
and
perhaps
the
only
thing
the
court
could
do
was
just
say,
that's
right,
get
it
precleared.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nothing
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nothing
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
there
are.
like
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
at
that
stage,
with
no
substantive
violation
of
section
5,
what
more
can
the
court
do
except
say,
okay,
get
preclearance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
that
isn't
so
clear,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
it
is
established
in
the
federal
district
court
that
preclearance
was
not
obtained,
and
that
it's
a
covered
jurisdiction,
what,
in
your
view,
could
the
district
court
do,
beyond
simply
saying,
hold
everything,
get
preclearance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nothing
more.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
this
complaint.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
stone,
i'm
not
sure
that's
even
an
issue
here.
was
the...
monterey
county
free
to
adopt
the
plans
that
it
did--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--at
the
time
that
it
took
the
actions
that
it
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
wasn't
mandated
by
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
didn't
require
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
not
your
position
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
all
of
this
other
discussion
about
your
views
of
state
action
and
section
5
is
not
really
at
issue
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
to
the
extent
that
what
was
challenged
here
in
the
complaint
was
a
failure
to
preclear
a
change
in
monterey
county's
municipal
and
justice
court
setup,
that
change
you
say
was
not
mandated
by
state
law,
and
to
the
extent
we
look
at
that,
i
assume
that
the
court
would
just
determine
whether
it
was
or
wasn't,
and
if
it
wasn't
would
order
preclearance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
do
we
get
into
all
this
other
stuff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
wasn't
what
the
complaint
alleged?
i
mean,
that's
all
that
was
before
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
wasn't
what
the
complaint
challenged.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
seems
to
me
that
affirmance
is
inconsistent
with
your
basic
argument
here,
which
is
that
all
the
court
could
do
was
order
preclearance.
i
mean,
how
could
we
affirm?
the
petitioners
asked
the
court
to
do
things
that
it
couldn't
or
shouldn't
do,
and
the
court
went
along
with
it,
and
you
want
us
to
affirm
it,
and
it
looks
to
me
like
to
be
consistent
with
your
view
we'd
have
to
reverse,
or
vacate
and
send
it
back
and
say
the
only
thing
on
this
complaint
you
could
do
is
order
preclearance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
monterey
county,
california
is
subject
to
the
federal
preclearance
requirement
set
forth
in
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
as
a
jurisdiction
covered
by
section
5,
the
county
may
not
enact
or
seek
to
administer
any
voting
practice
different
from
the
practices
in
effect
on
november
1,
1968
without
first
obtaining
approval
of
either
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
between
1972
and
1983,
monterey
county,
in
fact
adopted
a
series
of
ordinances
that
merged
nine
separate
judicial
districts
into
a
single
countywide
judicial
district.
the
county
did
not
submit
any
of
the
consolidation
ordinances
for
federal
preclearance
under
section
5.
the
appellants
in
this
case
sued
the
county
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
northern
district
in
1991,
alleging
that
the
county
had
not
obtained
section
5
preclearance
for
its
judicial
election
scheme.
the
three-judge
district
court
ordered
the
county
to
obtain
federal
preclearance
of
the
challenged
ordinances
but
the
county
did
not
submit
the
ordinances
to
the
appropriate
federal
authorities.
instead,
the
county
began
to
work
with
the
appellants
to
develop
a
new
judicial
election
plan
that
they
believe
would
be
less
retrogressive
than
the
at
large
countywide
election
scheme.
the
state
of
california
intervened
and
opposed
the
party’s
plans.
it
claimed
that
they
unnecessarily
violated
the
california
constitution
as
well
as
certain
california
statutes.
in
1994,
the
three-judge
district
court
finally
decided
to
adopt
as
an
interim
measure,
one
of
the
plans
proposed
by
the
county
and
the
appellant
even
though
the
plan
was
inconsistent
with
state
law.
in
1995,
this
court
issued
its
decision
in
miller
versus
johnson.
shortly
after
that,
the
three-judge
district
court
here
ruled
that
miller
casts
substantial
doubt
on
the
constitutionality
of
its
interim
plan.
in
1995
then,
it
ordered
the
county
to
conduct
judicial
elections
under
an
at
large
countywide
election
plan.
in
essence,
four
years
after
filing
the
complaint,
the
district
court
ordered
the
county
to
hold
elections
under
the
very
same
scheme
that
the
appellant
had
originally
challenged
under
section
5
as
unprecleared.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
the
district
court’s
order
that
the
county
conduct
elections
under
the
unprecleared
judicial
election
plan
conflicts
with
our
decision
in
clark
versus
roemer.
it
was
an
error
for
the
district
court
to
order
elections
under
the
at
large
countywide
election
plan
that
had
not
been
precleared
by
an
appropriate
federal
authority.
congress
intended
that
only
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
on
the
discriminatory
effect
or
purpose
of
an
election
change.
this
congressional
choice
in
favor
of
specialized
review
limits
the
role
of
the
three-judge
federal
district
court,
and
the
court
may
determine
only
whether
section
5
covers
a
contested
voting
change
whether
section
5’s
approval
requirements
were
satisfied,
and
if
the
requirements
were
not
satisfied,
what
temporary
remedy,
if
any,
is
appropriate?
the
goal
of
the
three-judge
district
court
facing
a
section
5
challenge
must
be
to
ensure
that
the
covered
jurisdiction
submits
its
election
change
to
appropriate
federal
authorities
as
expeditiously
as
possible.
a
county
has
not
discharged
its
obligation.
the
requirements
of
federal
scrutiny
should
besatisfied
without
further
delay.
the
judgment
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
