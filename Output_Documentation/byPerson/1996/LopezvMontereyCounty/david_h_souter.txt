justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
avila,
you're
not
making
an
alternative
argument
which
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
made,
and
i'm
beginning
to
think
that
i'm
missing
something
or
you
would
have
made
it,
and
the
argument
would
be
this.
section
5
refers
to
a
jurisdiction
which
enacts,
or
which,
i
think,
implements
a
plan
which
has
not
been
precleared,
so
that
even
if
the
county
took
no
independent
action,
and
even
if
the
county
were
doing
nothing
but
administering
state
law,
wouldn't
the
second
clause
of
section
5
pick
it
up,
so
that
it
would
require
preclearment
even
though
it
was
the
result
of
state
law
and
the
state
is
not,
as
an
entire
state,
a
covered
jurisdiction?
wouldn't
that
be
enough
to
create
the
section
5
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
enabling
it
to
take
a
course
of
action.
i'm
saying,
if
you
had
a
state
statute
that
required
it
to
take
a
course
of
action,
even
though
the
state
wasn't
covered,
and
even
though
the
county
alone
was
a
covered
jurisdiction,
by
following
that
state
law,
the
second
clause
of
section
5
would
require
preclearance,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
take
it,
what
this
case
presents
to
us
is
not
the
question
so
much
what
the
court
should
have
done,
or
might
have
done,
but
the
question
of
whether
what
it
did
do
was
wrong,
and
you're
saying
what
it
did
do
was
per
se
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
clear
error.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
that's
the
only
issue
before
us,
i
take
it.
if
we
agree
with
you,
back
it
goes,
and
people
will
have
to
figure
out
what
to
do
next.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
case,
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
depend
upon
our
so
assuming,
because
all
you
want,
in
theory,
and
all...
as
i
understand
it,
all
that
it
would
take
for
us
to
resolve
this
case,
and
all
that
it
would
have
taken
for
the
district
court
to
resolve
the
case
was
to
order,
just
as
justice
breyer
suggested
a
moment
ago,
no
election
under
this
plan.
what
happens
next
may
be
a
very
serious
state
problem,
but
that's
not
what
you
require
the
district
court
to
get
into.
all
you
are
asking
from
the
district
court
is,
enjoin
the
election.
enjoin
the
application
of
an
unprecleared
plan,
period.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
all
you
want
us
to
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
you
bring
a
complaint
saying
it's
unconstitutional?
i
mean,
why...
you
said
you
would
like
to
have
had
a
hearing,
but
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
may
be
wrong
on
this,
you
had
no
pleading
before
the
court
claiming
that
the
preceding
plan
was
in
fact
a
violation
either
of
section
2
or
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
right,
but
that
plan
was
limited
in
its
temporal
scope--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
i
recall.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
once
again,
the
only
thing
that
the
court
had
before
it
as
a
matter
of
pleading
or
complaint
was
a
claim
that
in
the
absence
of
that
interim
precleared
plan
there
was
no
precleared
plan,
and
therefore
no
election
should
be
held,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
jenkins,
why
don't
you...
why
doesn't
your
answer
go
this
way,
that
given
the
unconstitutionality
on
the
one
hand,
an
unprecleared
plan
on
the
other,
that
in
fact
everything
has
got
to
stop
until
somebody
comes
up
with
a
constitutional
plan?
now,
that
somebody
may
be
the
district
court.
if
the
district
court
has,
in
fact,
had
a
complaint
register...
or
filed
with
it
saying
the
old
plan
is
unconstitutional,
the
district
court
finds
that
it's
unconstitutional.
it
finds
no
precleared
alternative
to
the
unconstitutional
plan,
then
it's
clear
that
the
district
court
has
got...
absent
anybody's
better
idea,
the
district
court
has
got
the
jurisdiction
to
fashion
a
plan.
isn't
that
the
way
out
of
the
dilemma?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
guess
i'm
saying
you
shouldn't
have
accepted
the
choices
as
being
limited
to
the
two
because--
[laughter]
because
the
third
choice
is,
simply
file
a
complaint
saying
the
old
plan
is
unconstitutional,
let
the
district
court
adjudicate
it,
and
the
district
court
has
got
remedial
authority.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
sure
why,
because
the
court
has
got
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
a
complaint
that's
brought
in
front
of
it.
the
complaint
brought
in
front
of
it
says,
this
is
an
unprecleared
plan.
the
court
can
adjudicate
that,
says
it
is
unprecleared,
don't
use
it.
i
don't
see
why
the
court,
absent
some
further
pleading
before
it,
has
got
jurisdiction
to
do
anything.
if
at
that
point
the
party
says,
or
some
party
says,
whoops,
if
we
can't
use
this
unprecleared
plan,
then
we've
got
to
decide
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
old
plan.
if
they
don't
bring
a
complaint
that
the
old
plan
is
in
fact
unconstitutional,
then
i
don't
know
why
the
old
plan
wouldn't
be
followed.
if
they
do
bring
a
complaint
that
the
old
plan
is
unconstitutional,
and
the
court
so
finds,
then
the
court
has
got
jurisdiction
to
make
any
kind
of
remedial
order.
why
isn't
that
the
regime
that
we
should
assume?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i'm
suggesting
something
more.
i'm
saying
the
court
shouldn't
have
done
anything
more
than
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
should
adjudicate
what's
in
front
of
it,
and
if
the
only
thing
in
front
of
it
is
a
section
5
claim,
it
should
adjudicate
it
and
stop.
before
it
goes
any
further,
it
ought
to
have
another
claim
to
adjudicate
in
response
to
which
it
would
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
in
any
case
of
a
covered
jurisdiction
which
is
less
than
statewide,
the
state
legislature
basically
can
preclude
any
section
5
action
simply
by
enacting
a
new
state
statute
on
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
state
can
completely
defeat
the
jurisdiction
under
section
5
and
the
preclearance
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
this...
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
if
the...
i
thought
your
position
was
that
if
the
state
was
not
a
covered
jurisdiction,
and
only
a...
some
subdivision
of
the
state
was,
that
if
the
state
enacted
a
statute
which
changed
the
manner
of
election
in
the
covered
jurisdiction,
it
was
not
subject
to
preclearance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
i
think
it
follows...
i
mean,
that's
just
an
example
of
a
general
rule
that
in
any
case
of
a
section
5
jurisdiction
the
requirements
of
preclearance
can
simply
be
eliminated
by
the
adoption
by
the
state
of
a
statute
which
changes
the
manner
of
election
in
the
covered
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
isn't
much
left
of
section
5.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
get
clear
on,
i
guess,
a
further
point
there
that
is
raised
both
by
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
and
your
answer
to
justice
breyer?
in
an
action
like
this,
in
which
the
issue
is
whether
preclearance
is
required
and
whether,
if
so,
it
has
been
obtained,
and
the
court
concludes
that
it
is
required
and
it
hasn't
been
obtained,
is
it
your
position
that
the
court
can
enjoin
the...
an
election
under
the
unprecleared
plan?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
the
extent
of
it.
and
that's
it,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
would
be
moot,
then
your
answer...
then
you're
not
standing
by...
i
think
you're
not
standing
by
the
answer
you
gave
a
moment
ago
that
if
all
we
do
is
conclude
here
that
he
should
have
enjoined
the
use
of
the
plan
that
he
adopted,
that
that
would
restore
a
status
quo
ante,
and
the
status
quo
ante
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
you're
now
saying
it
wouldn't
restore
the
status
quo
ante.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
because
of
the
court's
extension.
all
right.
well
then,
isn't
justice
stevens
correct
in
his
suggestion
that
all
you
have
to
do,
if
the
case
goes
back
in
that
posture,
is
to
file
an
appropriate
pleading
saying
this
status
quo
ante
is
unconstitutional,
and
you
should
vacate
any
order
of
the
court
that
establishes
it?
you...
that's
open
to
you,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
that's
the
question...
and
that's
the
question
that
you
can
litigate
if
it
goes
back
in
the
posture
that
justice
stevens
and
i
are
suggesting.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
yet
another
issue.
that
is
yet
another
issue,
but
you
can
litigate
your
miller
claim,
can't
you,
if
it
goes
back?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
don't...
i
don't
know
what
procedural
basis
we'd
have
to
be
deciding
a
miller
claim,
either.
