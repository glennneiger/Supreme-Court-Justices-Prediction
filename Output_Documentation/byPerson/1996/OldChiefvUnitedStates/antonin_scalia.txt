justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought--
--mr.
donovan,
your
argument
and
also
your
reliance
on
403
assumes
that
the
only
evidence
admissible
is
evidence
which
is
probative.
that's
what
403
says,
if
it's
probative
value
is
outweighed
by
something
else.
is
that
the
case?
it
seems
to
me
a
lot
of
evidence
gets
in
in
trial
routinely
to
simply
place
a
crime
in
its
context.
for
example,
the
identity
of
the
victim,
as
the
chief
justice
was
alluding
to.
do
you
think
the
identity
of
the
victim,
if
it
happened
to
be
mother
teresa,
could
be
kept
out
of
the
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
grounds
of
what
difference
does
it
make
who
it
was?
it
was
a
murder,
and
pleading
403,
you
should
suppress
the
fact
that
it
was
mother
teresa.
i
doubt
whether
you
have
to
do
that.
it's
part
of
the
circumstances
of
the
event
which
the
state
is
entitled
to
get
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's
no
more
relevant
than
the
nature
of
the
prior
crime
in
your
case.
it
was
a
dead
human
being
is
all
that's
necessary
for
the
conviction.
the
identity
of
the
human
being
makes
no
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
i
come
in
with
a
stipulation,
i
stipulate
there
was
a
dead
human
being,
whereupon
you
think
the
state
could
be
precluded
from
introducing
who
the
human
being
was,
placing
this
event
in
its
real
life
context,
simply
because
that
would
be
harmful
to
the
defendant?
i
doubt
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question?
i
really
didn't
understand
it.
he
asked
you
whether
the
defendant
could
in
effect
render
a
trial
a
very
abstract
proceeding
by
asking
the
government
to
stipulate
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
with
the
only
issue
left
being
whether
the
defendant
in
fact
committed
it
or
not,
and
you
said
no,
but
then
you
followed
up
with
an
explanation
that
seemed
to
me
to
mean
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
no,
but
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
defendant
could
offer
the
government
a
stipulation,
and
if
the
government
refused
the
trial
court
could
exclude
that
information,
which
i
think
is
the
opposite
of
your
first
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
the
government...
and
what
must
the
judge
do?
you
think
the
judge
should
preclude?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
cases
are
they?
i
mean,
in
all
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
putting
before
the
jury
the
gory,
real
life
facts
is
always
going
to
be
harmful
to
the
defendant,
number
1.
number
2,
it
is
always
going
to
be
unnecessary
in
the
strictest
sense.
you
can
always
stipulate
there
was
a
dead
human
being.
what
criterion
are
you
urging
upon
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
escapes
it,
so
that
it
really
is
a
question
to
be
considered
under
403
whether
the
identity
of
the
victim
as
shirley
temple
or
mother
teresa
can
get
to
the
jury.
it's
up
to...
that's
really
a
403
question?
