are
you
saying
that
because
of
the
state
of
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit
there
was
no
way
you
could
have
gotten
a
403
balance?
i'm
confused
about
what...
the
exact
question
you
were
asking
us
to
decide,
however
you
phrased
it
in
your
cert
petition.
i
thought
you
said
that
in
the
ninth
circuit,
as
distinguished
from
the
first
circuit,
there
is
no
possibility
for
a
403
balancing
on
whether
the
jury
will
be
told
the
name
of
the
felony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
you're
challenging
is
circuit
law
that
says
that
the
character,
the
crime,
the
actual
crime,
the
name
of
that
crime
is
not
something
that
the
judge
should
weigh
in
a
403
balance,
it
just
comes
in
automatically.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
--mr.
donovan,
could
we
be
concrete
about
that?
i
thought
that
you
have
been
trying
to
tell
us
that
this
crime
is
different
from
all
others.
there
are
cases
out
there,
like
one
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
the
crowder
case,
which
does
say
defendant
wants
to
admit...
as
in
rule
36
of
the
civil
rules,
defendant
can
admit
so
intent
can
be
taken
out
of
the
case,
knowledge
can
be
taken
out
of
the
case.
i
thought
you
had
consistently
distinguished
your
case
from
those
others
on
the
ground
that
the
only
thing
that
congress
has
made
relevant
is
that
there
was
a
prior
felony
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
case
of
your
client,
were
there
other
prior
felony
convictions
that
could
have
been
used
to
establish
this
that
were
less
close
to
the
current
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
have
any
that
was
less?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
estrada,
i
have
problems
with
that
argument
in
this
context,
that
we
can
allow
every
district
judge
in
the
land
to
have
a
403
balance
when,
say,
the
conviction
is
for
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon,
and
judge
a
will
come
out
this
way,
and
judge
b
will
come
out
that
way.
i
think
that's
why
the
court
had
some
interest
in
this
case,
because
there
is
disarray,
and
the
one
thing
that
we
all
have
an
interest
in
is
to
say
what
the
law
is,
and
it
should
be
that
same
law,
so
what's
disturbing
about
your
suggestion
is
that,
oh,
403,
and
that's
it,
it
will
all
wash
out
in
every
individual
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
can't
be
the
government's
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
estrada,
if
you
are
now
taking
the
position
that
the
government
would
win
every
time
assuming
a
403
balance,
then
what
in
the
world
did
you
mean
in
your
brief
when
you
said,
consistent
with
those
principles,
where
a
defendant
offers
an
unconditional
stipulation
coupled
with
an
adequate
jury
charge,
the
trial
court
should
consider
the
availability
of
the
stipulation
as
one
of
the
factors
in
the
rule
403
balance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
could
understand
what
you
were
telling
me,
mr.
estrada,
if
the
portion
i
read
had
been
proceeded
by,
this
is
the
supreme
court's
case
law
and
so
because
of
that
case
law,
we
have
to
make
this
qualified
semi-concession,
but
what
it
flows
from
is
the
advisory
committee's
note
to
rule
403.
it's
nothing
about
the
court's
case
law.
it's
about--
--what
page
is
this
on?
this
is
on
page
27
and
28
of
the
government's
brief,
and
the
particular...
the
paragraph
is
the
runover
paragraph
starting
from
the
bottom
of
page
27,
and
the
sentence
that
puzzles
me
is,
consistent
with
those
principles
which
seem
to
be
the
principle
that
motivated
rule
403.
