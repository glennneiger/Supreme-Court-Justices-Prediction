mr.
daniel
donovan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fact
of
the
prior
felony
conviction,
not
the
nature
of
the
prior
felony
conviction,
is
an
element
of
the
offense
of
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
the
name
and
nature
of
that
underlying
conviction
is
not
relevant
to
that
issue.
mr.
daniel
donovan
yes.
mr.
daniel
donovan
yes,
and
in
this
particular
case
there
were
pieces
of
evidence
that
we
contended
weren't
relevant.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well,
also
the
indictment
itself.
it's
a
practice
of
this
judge
to
have
the
prosecutor
read
the
indictment
to
the
jury
at
the
time
of
the
voir
dire,
so
we
had
come
in
pretrial
and
filed
a
motion
in
limine
asking
the
judge
to
prohibit
that
reading
as
well
as
the
prejudicial...
we
contend
the
prejudicial
parts
from
the
judgment--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well,
yes,
but
we
did
do
three
things.
the
first
thing
was
move
in
limine
to
exclude,
the
second
thing
was
offer
to
stipulate,
and
the
third
thing,
we
submitted
a
proposed
jury
instruction
we
felt
even
went
farther
than
stipulation
and
admitted,
basically,
the
fact
or
the
element.
mr.
daniel
donovan
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well,
we
only
made
a
verbal
offer.
we
never
got
farther
than
that
because
the
government
basically
said
we
don't
have
to
stipulate
if
we
don't
want
to.
the
trial
judge
said
they
don't
have
to
stipulate
if
they--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--they
offered
a...
well,
aside
from
reading
the
indictment
and
mentioning
it
during
the
trial,
they
offered
the
judgment
and
conviction
document.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well,
it
may
be
relevant
in
general,
but
what
i
was
saying
was,
parts
of
it
were
not
relevant,
and
i
tried
to
solve
that
problem
pretrial,
and
the
judge
basically
said
no.
mr.
daniel
donovan
no.
i
just
fell
back
and
put
the
government
to
their
proof,
basically,
but
i
still
renewed
the
objection
during
the
trial.
mr.
daniel
donovan
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
donovan
that's
true.
what
i'm
really
saying
is
that
i
think
a
stipulation
is
the
best
remedy
for
this
problem,
and
i'm
asking--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--what
i
did,
though,
i
did
offer
a
proposed
jury
instruction
whereby
the
jury
would
instruct
the...
or
the
judge
would
instruct
the
jury
that
you
are
hereby
instructed
that
the
defendant,
johnny
lynn
old
chief,
has
been
convicted
of
an
offense
punishable
by
a
term
of
imprisonment
exceeding
1
year,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--right.
mr.
daniel
donovan
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
think
the
problem
is
the
ninth
circuit
case,
the
breitkreutz
case,
which
the
government...
the
prosecutor
and
the
trial
judge
relied
on
i
think
is
decided
wrong,
because
it
says
if
there
is
an
offer
to
stipulate
in
this
kind
of
a
case
you
don't
apply
403,
but
i
think
clearly
the
government's
admitted
here,
and
they
admitted
i
think
in
1992
in
a
case
that
was
argued
called
hadley,
that
an
offer
to
trigger,
or
offer
to
stipulate--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--does
trigger
a
403
balancing
analysis--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--and
we
never
had
such
an
analysis
here.
it's
therefore--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
the
government's
required
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
think
this...
i'm
asking
the
court
just
to
focus
on
this
one
statute,
and
i'm
saying
in
addition
to
the
stipulation
issue
that
the
nature
of
the
prior
conviction
is
not
relevant,
and--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--i
think
that's
true,
but
you
start
with
a
proposition
that
that
evidence
is
relevant,
and
then
of
course
you
could
argue
403.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well,
if
you
combine
the
total...
if
you're
calling
the
total
judgment
and
conviction
document
itself
relevant,
yes,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
part
of
that
judgment
includes
the
nature
and
name
of
the
prior
felony,
which
isn't
relevant,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
old
chief
got
60
months,
obviously,
which
is
more
than--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well,
i
did
raise
that
at
the
trial
level,
and
the
problem
with
the
ninth--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--i
argued
403
balance
here.
i'm
saying
if
you
assume
this
is--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--yes,
and--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well,
that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
the
court
to
look
at
are
some
of
the
circuit
cases,
tavares
in
the
first
circuit,
and
what...
basically
what
that
says
is
the
offer
to
stipulate
triggers
a
process
and
then
the
government
has
to
come
in
and
prove
under
403
that
there
is
probative
value
which--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--and
i
think
i
did
that,
but
i
got
ignored,
and
again,
i
feel
because
of
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
case...
breitkreutz
says
if
you
object,
if
you
offer
to
stipulate,
you
don't
apply
the
403
balancing
test.
mr.
daniel
donovan
yes,
and
ninth
circuit
law
says
you
don't
trigger
it.
mr.
daniel
donovan
yes.
mr.
daniel
donovan
and
the
tavares
test
in
the
first
circuit
stands
for
the
proposition
if
the
government
refuses
to
stipulate,
you
still
exclude
that
evidence
by
some
other
means,
and
the
first--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--no,
i--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--i
think
in
comparison
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
victim
of
the...
the
evidence
of
the
victim
of
the
crime
is
a
relevant
question.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--i
think
that
does
place
it
in
the
real
life
context
and
get
into
evidence
of
the
act
and
intent
of
the
crime,
and
one
thing
i'm
saying
here,
the
status
of
the
felon
is
not
part
of
the
act
and
intent
of
the
crime.
it's
something
different.
mr.
daniel
donovan
that's
how
i
read
the
ninth
circuit
breitkreutz
case,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
automatically
comes
in
regardless
of
defense
objection
or
defense
offer
to
stipulate.
and
i
think
that's
how
i
got
here.
that's
why
i
got
here.
mr.
daniel
donovan
no,
i...
i
mean,
it's
an
aspect
of
the
question,
yes.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
government
is
entitled
to
present
a
full
picture
of
that,
and
it
also
relates
to
whether
or
not
there
was
self-defense.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well,
my
first
argument
is,
it's
not
relevant.
mr.
daniel
donovan
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
donovan
and
i
think
that's
the
rule
of
the
first
circuit,
is
just
that,
but--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--that's--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well,
the...
i
believe
the
answer
is
whether
or
not
it's
a
qualifying
crime
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
court
to
determine,
and
whether
or
not
the
defendant
in
fact
committed
that
crime,
or
was
convicted
of
that
crime,
is
a
question
of
fact--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
donovan
no.
no,
i
don't
think
it
can,
but
the
defendant
can
offer
to
stipulate
or
object
and
get
a
403
analysis
and
ask
the
court
to
exclude
that
over
government
objection.
mr.
daniel
donovan
that's
essentially--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well,
i
think
i
am
going
there,
and
i'm
asking
the
court
to
consider
the
tavares
rule,
and
i
think
the
tavares
rule
is
better
summarized
in
the
case
of
melvin,
which
is
cited
in
the
amicus
brief,
and
that
basically
melvin
states
that
in
a
felony
possession
of
a
firearm
case,
evidence
of
the
nature
of
a
prior...
of
the
nature
of
the
prior
conviction
is
not
admissible
unless
the
government
establishes
probative
value
in
the
403
balancing
process,
and
i
think
that
is
a
simple
rule
to
apply.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--i
think
that--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well,
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
defendant
can't
preclude...
cannot
on
his
own
preclude,
but
he
could
offer
to
stipulate
it,
otherwise
object
and
ask
the
judge
to
preclude,
and
of
course
the
government
would...
would
not--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--no,
the
gov...
the
judge...
well,
i
would
argue
in
certain
cases,
in
certain
situations
the
judge
should
apply
403
and
exclude
the
evidence,
but
the
government
would
argue,
and--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well,
i
think...
if
i
may
give
an
example,
i
think
the
trial
court's
rule
on
photographs,
for
example,
every
day,
and
the
defense
may
say,
this
photograph
is
too
gory,
but
this
one
isn't,
and
the
prosecution
may
say,
we
want
to
use
a
real
gory
photograph,
and
the
judge
applies
403
and
decides
that
gory
photograph
is
so
highly
prejudicial
i'm
going
to
keep
it
out,
even
though
the
government
wants
to
introduce
it.
mr.
daniel
donovan
the
first
circuit
addressed
that,
and
in
me
advocating
the
first
circuit
rule,
the
first
circuit
basically
says,
that
would
also
be
irrelevant,
so
that
doesn't
come
in.
mr.
daniel
donovan
right.
it
applies
both
ways.
mr.
daniel
donovan
unless
it's--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--redacted.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
think...
and
that's
one
of
my
arguments
to
advocate
a
stipulation
is
better
than
a
redacted
judgment
and
conviction,
because
if
you
redact
the
judgment
and
conviction
by
crossing
out
lines
and
such,
i
think
that
invites
jury
speculations
of
what
was
crossed
out,
whereas
if
you
have
a
clean
stipulation,
it
is
hereby
stipulated,
the
jury
either
hears
that
or
reads
that,
and
there's
less
likelihood
for
speculation
to
come
up.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well,
but
i
think
the
reason
this
court
has
to
do
something
is,
there's
a
different
rule
in
some
of
the
circuits,
and
my
circuit,
obviously
the
ninth
circuit
happens
to
be
against
the
defendant,
and
the
other
circuits,
most
of
the
other
circuits
now
would
rule
in
my
favor.
mr.
daniel
donovan
and
that's--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--that's
my
first
points.
that
isn't...
the
nature
of
the
offense
is
not
relevant.
mr.
daniel
donovan
unless
the
government
had
some
other
legitimate
reason
for--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--well--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--it's
unfair
in
the
sense
of
this
case
is
a
prior
conviction,
and
was
assault
resulting
in
serious
bodily
injury
which
first
brands
old
chief
as
a
violent
felon.
and
then
when
you
have
this
case
where
you
have
count
1
as
a
felon
in
possession,
count
3
as
a
new
felony
assault,
then
we
have
the
propensity,
well,
if
he
did
it
before--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--okay.
well,
if
the
element
is
a
conviction
of
an
offense,
of
a
crime
for
an
offense
with
the
punishment
exceeding
1
year,
then
i'm
saying
that's
all
the
jury
needs
to
know.
it
doesn't
need
to
know
that
it
was
assault,
or
theft,
or
whatever.
mr.
daniel
donovan
aside
from
the
redacted
and...
the
redacted
judgment
and
conviction
they
could
bring
in
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
testify,
a
probation
officer
to
testify--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--that
would
be
my
position,
yes.
mr.
daniel
donovan
well,
the
judge
would...
the
judge
i
think
would
instruct
the
jury
that
this
offense
that
the
government
has
introduced,
this
prior
case--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--yes.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
think
if
he
contests
the
prior
conviction
the
whole
thing's
open
for
evidence,
but
if
he
says,
i'm
going
to
contest
whether
or
not
i
was
convicted
of
it,
but
i
admit
that
it
was
an
offense
for
which
the
term
of
imprisonment
could
exceed
1
year,
then
i
think
the
judge
could
instruct
the
jury
that
that
part
of
the
element's
proven
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
daniel
donovan
the
judge
accept
it
as
an
admission
of
fact?
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
think
the
judge
could.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
believe...
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
difference,
but
there's
a
jury
instruction
that
as
i
understand
it
would
say
if
the
parties
have...
or
a
party
has
admitted
this
fact.
you
should
consider
this
fact
proven.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
donovan
and
i
think
i
tried
to
say
to
that
previously
was
that
that
doesn't
relate
to
the
act
and
the
intent
of
the
offense
or
the
picture
of
the
offense.
it
only
relates
to
the
accused's
status.
mr.
daniel
donovan
there
actually
was
one
that
the
government
considered
more
prejudicial,
was
a
robbery.
he
had
a
robbery--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--no,
none
less.
there
were
just
two
to
pick
from,
basically.
mr.
daniel
donovan
see,
it
was
all--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--it
was
all
part
of
a
written
motion.
mr.
daniel
donovan
no,
but
in
the
process
of...
what
i
did
in
writing
was...
i
tried
to
say
this.
not
only
did
i
offer
to
stipulate,
but
i
moved
in
limine
to
exclude
the
evidence,
and
i
offered
this
jury
instruction,
and
the
judge's
motion
denied
the
whole
motion
in
limine,
so...
i've
been
dealing
with
the
judge
for
15
years.
you
state
your
objection,
you
get
overruled,
and
that's
it,
you
know.
[laughter]
mr.
daniel
donovan
and
another
thing
that
happened
here
is
the
judge
read
the
jury
instructions
to
the
jury
before
we
had
a
settlement
conference,
so
i
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
object
or
resubmit
or
have
any
discussions
with
the
court
until
after
the
instructions
were
read.
mr.
daniel
donovan
right.
i
can't
submit...
ask
to
change
the
instructions
or
withdraw,
you
know,
so
i
was
kind
of
boxed
in.
mr.
daniel
donovan
i
just...
i
renewed
the
motion
in
limine
when
the
judgment
and
conviction
was
admitted
into
the
evidence,
and
i
also
renewed
it
as
a
basis
of
the
objection
to--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--i
didn't
use
the
words
403
except
pretrial,
mr.
justice
kennedy.
may
i
reserve
the
remaining--
mr.
daniel
donovan
--thank
you.
mr.
daniel
donovan
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
make
four
quick
points.
first,
the
government
never
objected
to
my
proposed
stipulation
until
this
level.
it
was
never
talked
about
at
the
trial
court
or
the
circuit
court,
so
we
never
had
any
discussion
to
resolve
it.
mr.
daniel
donovan
right.
that's
true,
and
that
was
the
entire
focus.
secondly,
i
agree
the
government
has
a
right
or
a
duty
to
present
the
case
as
they
see
fit,
but
i
don't
think
they
can
do
that
and
violate
the
rules
of
evidence
at
the
same
time.
we're
contending
they
violated
401,
402,
404,
and
403.
thirdly,
i
think
this
is
significant.
at
footnote
12,
page
20
of
the
government's
brief,
and
it
goes
on
to
page
21,
i
feel
the
government
admits
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's...
it
is
a
qualifying
felony
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
judge
to
decide,
and
if
it's
a
question
of
law
for
the
judge
to
decide,
there's
no
need
to
tell
the
jury
the
nature
of
the
felony.
mr.
