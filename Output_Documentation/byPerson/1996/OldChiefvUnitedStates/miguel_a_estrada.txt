mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
922(g)
expressly
requires
proof
that
a
defendant
has
been
convicted
before.
there
can
be
no
doubt,
and
i
think
it
has
been
conceded
here
today,
that
in
the
absence
of
a
proffered
stipulation
the
certified
judgment
of
conviction
would
no
longer
be
the
most
probative
evidence,
but
the
evidence
that
the
government
naturally
would
be
expected
to
rely
on.
the
question,
then,
in
this
case
is
whether
a
criminal
defendant
can
keep
the
government
from
proving
a
criminal
case
in
the
usual
and
ordinary
way
by
interjecting
its
own
alternative
method
of
proof.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
under
our
view,
yes,
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
because
the
definitional
section
that
lets
us
know
what
is
a
felony,
or
what
is
a
crime
punishable
for
more
than
1
year
imprisonment,
exclude
certain
offenses,
and
in
order
for
the
jury
to
fulfill
its
factfinding
function
it
would
have
to
be
instructed
as
to
what
offenses
are
covered
and
whether
the
one
that
they
have
heard
evidence
on
is
actually
one
of
those
offenses.
in
other
words,
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
a
proper
instruction
would
be,
i
instruct
you
that
mail
fraud
is
one
of
the
offenses
that
is
covered.
it
is
for
you
to
find
that...
whether
this
particular
defendant
has
been
found
guilty
of
mail
fraud.
under
their
view,
the
instruction
would
be,
i
instruct
you
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
covered
felony
and
you
have
no
further
factual
finding
functions
in
this
case
as
to
that
element.
and
i
think
that
that
difference
highlights
that
at
the
threshold,
to
get
back
to
your
earlier
question,
the
type
of
the
felony
is
indeed
relevant,
even
taking
their
own
conception
of
how
relevancy
should
work.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
that
is
close
to
true,
but
not
exactly,
and
i
think
it
is
sufficiently
distinct
to
warrant
some
emphasis.
what
they
say
is
that
a
stipulation,
as
a
stipulation,
does
not
get
factored
into
the
rule
403
balance,
and
i
think
if
you
take
what
a
stipulation
is
strictly,
that
would
be
true.
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
an
offer
to
stipulate
in
the
sense
that
justice
souter
pointed
out
earlier
as
an
offer
to
tender
an
admission
and
then
put
in
an
admission,
and
viewed
in
that
light,
we
would
concede
that
(a)
it
wouldn't
truly
be
a
stipulation
in
the
technical
sense,
but
(b)
that
rule
403
could
contemplate
that
that
could
be
factored
into
the
rule
403--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
best
evidence
rule
i
think
textually
would
apply,
and
i
think
it
is
not
usually
thought
to
have
direct
bearing
because
everybody
understands
in
the
more
specific
factual
context
here
that
the
relevant
unit
of
what
the
evidence
is
is
the
judgment
of
conviction
itself,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
rather
than
particular
information
within
the
judgment
or
conviction,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--maybe
we
didn't--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
guess
that
is
literally
true,
but
it
does
not
convey
the
understanding
that
maybe
we
inartfully
put
into
it.
what
we
meant
is
that
in
every
ruling
in
a
trial
court
there
is
always
a
403
issue.
that
is
to
say,
there
is
always
open
the
argument
that
upon
a
consideration
of
the
proper
factors
the
evidence
should
be
excluded.
the
fact
that
a
weighing
might
be
conducted,
and
the
fact
that
an
admission
might
properly
be
considered
in
the
weighing
says
nothing
about
the
outcome
of
the
weighing,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
not
what
we
mean
to
convey,
justice
ginsburg.
let
me
step
back
and
put
rule
403
in
context
from
our
point
of
view.
rule
402
in
effect
says
all
evidence
must
come
in
unless
it
is
specifically
excludable
by
some
source
of
law,
and
if
it
is
a
rule
made
up
by
a
court,
it
has
to
be
made
by
this
court,
noting
the
exercise
of
freewheeling
authority,
but
under
statutory
authority.
rule
403
is
an
exclusionary
rule
that
gives
the
district
courts
authority
to
have
play
in
the
joints,
if
you
will,
but
it's
not
a
source
of
rulemaking
authority.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
there
are
lots
of
questions,
justice
scalia.
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
all
require
the
same
answer,
and
i
agree
with
you
that
in
a
criminal
case
in
effect
you
have
a
categorical
rule
that
this
evidence
always
comes
in.
but
let
me
make
this
point,
and
i
think
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
to
what
the
problem
is
here
earlier,
which
is
trying
to
tease
this
particular
result
out
of
the
rules
of
evidence
is
to
some
extent
an
exercise
in
misdirection,
because
these
are
matters
that
tend
to
flow
from
the
controlling
substantive
law.
they
may
be
different
in
civil
cases
or
in
criminal
cases,
and
they're
dealt,
to
the
extent
that
they're
different,
in
the
civil
rules
or
in
the
criminal
rules.
in
the
civil
rules,
you
are
encouraged
to
get
your
adversary
to
narrow
down
the
issues
and
under
rule
8
you
have
to
say
what's
true
and
what
isn't
and
what
is
not
under
dispute,
and
that's
enforced
through
rule
11.
under
rule
36
of
the
civil
rules,
you
can
ask
your
adversary
for
an
admission
that
you
can
use.
now
you
switch
to
the
criminal
rules.
in
the
criminal
rules,
you
have
a
trial
of
the
general
issue
unless
you
enter
a
complete
guilty
plea.
there
is
no
inbetween.
there
is
rule
11
that
says
that
you
can
have
a
guilty
plea,
but
there
is
nothing
that
contemplates
what
is
being
argued
for
here,
which
is
in
effect
a
partial--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
can...
generally,
yes,
but
i
would
like
to
qualify
that
in
the
following
respect,
justice
stevens.
the
principle
that
we
are
contesting
here
is
not
that
the
district
court
has
no
discretion.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
answer
is,
probably
it
could,
and
when
it
did,
we
likely
would
have
no
remedy
in
most
of
the
cases,
but
let
me--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--okay--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
it
would
be
that
the
second
felony
is
cumulative.
it
is
relevant,
but
i
as
the
district
judge
have
to
keep
this
trial
moving
along.
you,
the
government,
have
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
every
fact,
and
conceivably
you
could
bring
20
people
to
testify
as
to
every
relevant
fact--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
i
think
all...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't
think
relevance
is
a
factor
in
that.
i
think
that
if
you
have
more
than
one,
and
if
it
is
plain
that
the
government
is
just
piling
on,
as
someone
said,
it
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
let
me
get
to
that,
because
i
think
that
is
an
important
issue,
and
it
has
gone...
and
the
argument
has
been
that
we
could
have
no
conceivable
purpose
to
turn
down
a
stipulation.
and
let
me
outline
four
for
you.
1.
we
get
to
try
our
own
case,
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
there
is
a
tactical
value
in
not
letting
our
opponent
set
for
the
jury
what
the
case
is
about.
have
the
argument
to
the
jury
that
we
only
fight
the
government
on
the
little
detail
on
which
they
are
wrong,
which
incidentally
is
all
you
need
to
find
to
let
my
client
go.
the
second
point
is
that
we
want
the
jury
to
have
evidence
that
it
can
touch
and
see.
it
is
an
exhibit.
under
their
approach
the
jury
would
hear
nothing
from
the
government
during
the
trial
on
one
entire
element
of
the
offense.
under
our
approach--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that
wasn't
done
here,
justice
stevens.
it
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
that
that
is
a
somewhat
different
case,
but
not
enough,
and
let
me
explain
to
you
why.
the
principle
that
we're
sticking
up
for
here
is
not
that
the
district
judge
has
to
let
us
run
how
the
courtroom
is
run,
but
that
we
have
a
right
to
try
our
own
case
without
our
adversary
shaping
how
our
evidence
comes
in--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--through
technical
concessions.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
when
the
facts
are
those,
yes,
that
is
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
no--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
what
i
said
earlier
about
what
the
rules
of
evidence
contemplate
as
being
within
the
proper
scope,
i
think
there's
emphasis,
because
at
the
time
that
the
rules
came
into
being
in
1975,
it
was
already
a
settled
rule
that
the
government
could
not
be
required
to
accept
a
stipulation
because
it
always
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
it
always
bears
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion,
and
it
is
their
burden
to
show
that
there
is
something
in
the
rules
that
changes
that.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
i
guess
the
close
that
you
could...
the
closest
that
you
could
come
is
that
there
are
cases
in
which
a
defendant
will
confess,
and
under
the
hearsay
rules
you
can
have
evidence
of
the
confession
as
an
admission,
which
is
not
hearsay,
but
it
is
not
in
the
same--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--let
me--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
let
me
start
out
with
the
last
point,
which
is
the
redaction
point.
there
is
no
issue
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
redaction
in
this
case
in
this
court,
because
the
defendant
never
asked
for
it
in
the
district
court.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't
want
to
fight
with
the
formulation
of
the
question,
merely
to
note
that
if
you
took
the
case
to
answer
that
question,
it
doesn't
raise
the
question,
because
it's
not
within
the
question
that
he
brought
to
the
court.
the
question
that
he
brought
to
the
court
is
limited
to
the
stipulation
issue.
moving
to
the
merits,
we
have
a
fundamental
disagreement
with
how
your
former
court
dealt
with
the
question,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
wrongly
started
on
the
wrong
assumption,
which
is
that
the
nature
of
the
type
of
felony
is
not
relevant,
if
you
want
to
use
that
word,
and
that
was
wrong.
it
was
also
wrong--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
but
it
is
an
instruction
on
the
law
that
is
no
different
from
every
other
instruction
that
the
judge
gives,
and
as
i
said
earlier,
the
instruction
that
would
be
the
outcome
of
the
first
circuit's
case
is
quite
different.
it
is,
i
instruct
you
that
on
this
element
you
have
no
factfinding
rule,
which
is
quite
different,
and
it
opens
up
the
government
to
other
risks.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that
was
not
even
the...
that
was
not
the
instruction
that
was
tendered
in
this
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
because--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
yes
we
do,
because
they're
different
arguments
that
different
members
of
the
court--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that's
right,
and
that
seems
what
the
question
that
justice
breyer
asked--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that's
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
mm-hmm.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
never
unfair,
because
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
crime
that
congress
necessarily
contemplated
that
we
would
prove
this
element
in
the
vast
run
of
cases
in
which
there
was
a
trial
with
this
very
evidence,
and
it
may
be
that
the
defendant
doesn't
like
it,
but
it
is
his
judgment
of
conviction,
and
it
is
relevant
evidence.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
maybe
that
wasn't
clear,
and
that's
our
fault,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
structure
of
the
argument
is
as
follows:
in
1975
the
rule
was
settled
that
we
didn't
have
to
do
this.
if
you
disagree
that
a
stipulation
is
something
that
can
be
forced
upon
the
government,
then
it
only
comes
into
play
once
it
has
given
us
adequate
insurance
against
the
risk
of
nonpersuading
the
jury,
which
means
that
it
has
to
be
coupled
with
an
instruction
that
effectively
tells
the
jury
that
we
are
home
on
the
element,
have
no
doubt
about
it.
in
this
case,
and
it
bears
emphasis,
while
tendering
an
instruction
that
ostensibly
took
this
issue
from
the
jury,
mr.
old
chief
also
tendered
an
instruction
that
reminded
the
jury
that
we
kept
the
burden
of
proof
on
every
element
of
the
crime,
and
that
is
exactly
the
danger
that
i'm
trying
to
highlight
for
the
court.
all
of
the
issues
that
justice
breyer
brought
up,
whether
you
could
enter
a
severance,
whether
you
could
have
a
redacted
judgment,
had
to
do
with
how
courts
have
traditionally
dealt
with
evidence
before
and
after
the
rules
of
evidence.
what
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--mm-hmm.
that
flows
not
from
a
case
from
this
court,
justice
ginsburg,
but
from
a
recognition
that
the
advisory
committee
note
indicates
that
the
availability
of
alternative
means
of
proof
is
a
factor
that
should
be
considered
by
a
court
in
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
under
rule
403,
and
conceivably,
the
existence
of
a
stipulation
that
acts
as
an
alternative
means
of
proof,
if
it
is,
in
fact,
such,
should
be
considered
in
keeping
with
what
the
advisory
committee
said.
that
is
not
to
say
that
unless
we're
entering
20
judgments
of
conviction,
or
we're
doing
other
things
of
the
type
that
rule
403
contemplates,
that
we're
not
entitled
to
prove
our
case
in
our
own
way.
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
saying
that
the
judge
can
keep
the
case
moving
along
after
considering
all
relevant
facts
and
saying
that
we're
going
to
have
for
the
first
time
as
a
rule
of
law
the
proposition
that
the
criminal
defendant
can
dictate
how
the
government's
case
is
tried,
because
acceptance
of
the
latter
proposition
is
what
we're
fighting
here.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the
answer,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
irrelevant
item
of
evidence
is
the
judgment
of
conviction.
the
rules
of
evidence
treat
the
possibility
that
parts
of
a
relevant
piece
of
evidence
will
be
misused
not
as
a
question
of
relevancy
but
as
a
question
to
be
dealt
with
under
rule
105
with
limiting
instructions,
because
a
background
principle
of
our
system
is
that
juries
will
follow
such
instructions.
with
respect,
i
would
also
suggest
to
you
that
part
of
what
drove
the
court
of
appeals
in
tavares
is
a
little
bit
of
a
disagreement
with
the
congressional
policy
that
is
reflected
in
the
statute,
that
it
is
unfair
to
have
a
crime
that
holds
someone
who
has
already
done
his
time
and
paid
his
debt
to
society,
but
if
the
evidence
is
what
congress
necessarily
must
have
anticipated
would
be
used
to
prove
that
element
of
the
crime,
you
may
think
that
it
is
not
a
fair
statute,
but
that's
not
a
problem
with
the
evidence,
it's
a
problem
with
the
policy
of
the

mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
the
answer
is
this,
justice
kennedy.
under
the
substantive
criminal
law,
we
always
bear
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion.
we
cannot
get
a
directed
verdict
no
matter
how
overwhelming
the
evidence,
and
it
is
open
to
the
defendant
to
invite
doubt
as
to
any
piece
of
evidence,
even
his
own
admission,
and
because
that
has
always
been
the
rule
in
our
system,
it
was
already
the
substantive
law
in
1975
that
we
could
not
be
required
to
accept
a
stipulation
from
our
opponent.
our
burden--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
and
you
need
go
no
further
than
this
case
to
realize...
and
we
quote
this
at
page
29
of
our
brief.
it
was
proposed
jury
instruction
number
22,
tendered
in
this
very
case
in
conjunction
with
their
stipulation
instruction,
saying
that
his
plea
of
guilty
puts
at
issue
every
fact,
and
the
government
retains
the
burden.
and
it
is
possible
for
someone
who
has
to
do
nothing
other
than
to
raise
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
to
give
what
in
effect
amounts
to
mark
anthony's
speech,
brutus
is
an
honorable
man,
and
keep
saying
it.
we've
stipulated.
maybe
it
wasn't
provident,
but
we've
stipulated
it,
and
under
our
rule...
under
our
system,
when
we
always
have
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion,
we're
entitled
to
put
in
front
of
the
jury
evidence
that
they
can
see
and
touch.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
right.
[laughter]
that's
correct.
that
is
correct,
and
i
fully
concede
it
is
a
practical
concern,
but
it's
one
that
has
shaped
what
the
substantive
law
is
in
this
country
since
the
beginning.
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
no
matter
how
overwhelming
the
evidence,
we
can
always
be
nonsuited
by
a
jury
that
has
any
doubt
on
any
reason,
even
an
irrational
one.
and
our
view
is
very
simple.
seeing
is
believing.
we
want
the
jury
to
have
in
their
hands
the
judgment
of
conviction
with
the
gun,
the
shell
casings,
and
the
photos.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
