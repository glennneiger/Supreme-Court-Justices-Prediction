sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
there's
all
this
complication
about
this.
this
fellow
was
convicted
of
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year,
or
whatever
it
was,
and
he's
willing
to
admit
it.
that
takes
care
of
the
whole
issue
in
about
15
seconds,
it
would
seem
to
me.
is
there
a
provision
in
the
criminal
rules
for
admission
of
facts
the
way
there
is
in
the
civil
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
estrada,
this
situation
is
a
little
bit
different,
in
that
the
defendant
isn't
contending
that
any
of
the
part
of
the
story
of
the
crime
at
issue,
the
current
possession,
can
be
kept
out.
he's
just
talking
about
an
element
that
puts
the
defendant
eligible
for
this
particular
guilt.
and
if
for
your...
to
give
an
example
that
troubles
me,
supposing
there
are
two
felonies
that
the
man
had
been
guilty
of
before.
in
your
view,
does
the
government
have
the
right
to
put
both
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
them
the
other
way.
does...
would...
i
guess
the
same
question.
do
you
think
the
district
judge
could
not
exclude
one
of
the
two
felonies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
could
he
exclude
one?
what
would
be
the
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is...
would
it
not
be
that
the
second
felony
is
really
irrelevant
because
the
condition--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--had
been
established?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
could
certainly
put
two...
you
could
certainly
put
two
convictions
in
in
2
minutes.
you
wouldn't
need...
i
think
you
can't...
cumulative
evidence
to
save
the
time
is
a
waste
of
time,
but
you
think
that's
the
only
reason
for
excluding
it,
would
be
that
it
would
be
cumulative?
you
don't
think
the
fact
it
would
be
prejudicial
would
be
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
second
conviction
would
be
prejudicial
and
would
not
add
to
the
person's
eligibility
for
the
particular
offense
he's
now
on
trial
for,
you
don't
think
that
the
relevance
is
a
factor
in
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
else
could
be
the
government's
purpose?
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
that's
not
necessarily
true.
the
government...
the
stipulation
could
be
the
first
element
of
the
government's
proof.
the
government
could
start
out
by
saying,
we've
accused
him
of
x
and
they
have
admitted
x,
so
we
don't
have
to
waste
any
time
proving
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
wasn't...
isn't
your
position
that
the
reason
it's
wrong
is
that
there
some
felonies,
some
business
crimes
and
so
forth
that
don't
give
rise
to
this
particular
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
something
that
the
judge
will
cure
by
his
instructions
to
the
jury?
in
any
event,
even
if
you
put
in
the
crime
itself,
the
judge
still
has
to
tell
the
jury
as
a
matter
of
law
this
is
a
qualifying
felony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
doesn't
say
you
have
no
factfinding
role.
he
says
either
the
stipulation
if
there
was
one,
or
the
admission
if
there
was
one,
or
the
redacted
judgment
if
there
was,
whatever
the
method
used,
he
would
say
that
is
sufficient.
the
government,
by
using
that,
has
proved
this
element
of
the
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand
that,
but
if
you're
asking
us
to
decide
whether
the
procedure
used
in
this
particular
case
was
sufficient,
you
might
win
this
case,
but
are
you
asking
for
a
general
rule
that
no
matter
how
the
defendant
tries
to
keep
this
out
the
government
always
can
get
the
nature
of
the
crime
in
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you
don't
have
to
argue
about
these
other...
the
procedural
difficulties.
