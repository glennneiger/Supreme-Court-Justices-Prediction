but
why
doesn't
that
just
raise
a
section
403
balance
question,
rather
than
some
question
of
whether
the
government
has
to
accept
a
stipulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
question,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
just
asks
whether
we
have
to
accept
the
offer
of
the
defendant
to
stipulate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
surely
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
see
what
relevance
the
offer
to
stipulate
has.
i
mean,
if
the
government
doesn't
have
to
accept
it,
and
i
think
it
doesn't,
then
it
just
doesn't
trigger
anything.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you'd
have
to
raise
the
403
issue,
and
ask
whether
what
is
offered
by
the
government
is
unduly
prejudicial
and
unfair.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
first
question
is
whether
the
evidence
of
the
nature
of
the
felony
offense,
the
prior
offense
is
relevant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
be
the
starting
point,
i
would
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it
is
relevant,
then
the
section
403
balance
would
exclude
it
if
it
unfairly
prejudices
the
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
it's
pretty
hard
to
say
that
disclosing
the
name
of
the
offense
is
an
unfair
prejudice.
i
mean,
what
the
defendant
did,
he
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
he
was
convicted
of
it,
and
it's
hard
for
me
at
least
to
say
it's
unfair
to
have
it
known.
a
much
harder
question
for
me
is
to
answer
whether
it
is
relevant
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
what's
unfair
about
it?
he
was
convicted
of
what
he
was
convicted
of,
and
i
don't
see
why
it's
unfair
that
the
jury
know
it.
it's
a
matter
of
public
record.
so
i
have
trouble
saying
it's
unfair,
but
i
don't
know,
yet,
whether
i
think
it's
irrelevant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
estrada,
under
the
particular
statute
that
we're...
that
says
if
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
punishable
by
more
than
a
year
in
prison,
is
the
nature
of
the
prior
offense
relevant
under
that
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
true
that
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
there
would
never
have
to
be
a
403
balancing
in
these
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
best
evidence
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
that
fit
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
mr.
estrada,
403
does
not
apply
unless
you
determine
first
that
the
evidence
offered
is
relevant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
say
it
is
relevant
because
of
the
crimes
that
are
excluded.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
agree
with
that,
then
it
can
be
excluded,
may
be
excluded,
if
the
probative
value
is
substantially
outweighed
by
the
danger,
not
of
prejudice,
but
unfair
prejudice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
not
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
is
your
position
on
whether
it's
unfair
or
not?
