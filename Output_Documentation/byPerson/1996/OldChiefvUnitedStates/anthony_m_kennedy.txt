justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you
did
that
on
the
assumption,
or
in
order
to
build
a
case
that
the
evidence
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
must
have
been...
must
be
excluded
based
on
your
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
--it
seems
to
me
this
is
very
much
of
a
403
case,
and
i
think
the
government
concedes
as
much.
i
don't
see
that
as
necessarily
presented
by
your
question.
that's
why
the
case
is
a
little
hard
to
grasp,
and
i
don't
see
you
arguing
it
in
your
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
--well,
i
think
it's
true
that
even
the
government
at
page
28
of
its
brief,
a
paragraph
i
can't
quite
square
with
its
position,
says
that
once
there
is
an
unconditional
offer
to
stipulate,
then
403
analysis
is
triggered,
so
in
that
sense
i
think
the
government
seems
to
agree
with
you
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
what
you
have
to
say
in
order
to
avoid
some
of
these
very
difficult
problems
is
that
evidence
of
the
prior
crime
for
the
felon
in
possession
statute
is
somehow
sui
generis
and
we
should
have
a
special
rule
for
that.
i'm--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
that's
a
difficult
principle
to
explain
if
i
have
to
write
the
opinion,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
where
you're
going.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view
i
take
it
the
certified
copy
of
previous
conviction
cannot
be
shown
to
the
jury.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
odd
evidentiary
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
redacted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
the
jury
has
to
read
something
that's
redacted.
that's
an
odd
way
to
proceed,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
there's
so
much
trouble
in
enforcing
the
rule
you
propose,
maybe
that
indicates
that
we
shouldn't
try
to
make
the
effort.
the
historical
fact
is
the
historical
fact
and
the
jury
considers
it
for
what
it's
worth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
only
if
the
defendant
stipulates
that
he's
not
going
to
contest
the
prior
conviction?
suppose
he
says,
i'm
going
to
contest
the
prior
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
have
a
rule
in
advance
based
on
what
the
defendant's
tactical
decision
is
and
how
that
tactical
decision
is
communicated
to
the
prosecution
and
to
the
court.
that
also
strikes
me
as
a
little
odd.
and
how
does
the
best
evidence
rule
fit
in
here?
normally
the
best
evidence
is
considered
the
official
order
or
record,
and
that
is
what
the
state
would
be
required
to,
offer
and
seek
admission
of,
because
that's
better
evidence
than
the
testimony
of
some
clerk
or
probation
officer.
so
i
don't
know
how
the
application
of
that
rule
would--
--mr.
donovan,
i
don't
understand
why...
i've
been
in
a
lot
of
courtrooms...
why
if
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says
i'm
willing
to
stipulate
to
x,
y,
and
z,
why
does
the
government
have
to
sign
that
stipulation?
can't
the
judge
accept
that
as
a
fact
that's
taken
as
proved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
you
raise
a
403
objection?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
base
your
objection
on
403?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
is
403
balancing,
mr.
estrada,
necessary
if
your
position
is
that
the
nature
of
the
offense
is
relevant
for
the
jury's
consideration,
or
for
the
jury's
determination?
i
had
that
trouble
with...
at
page
28
of
your
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you
con...
i
read
it
as
a
concession
that
403
analysis
can
apply
in
these
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
know
of
no
other
area...
we're
talking
about
the
difficulty
of
having
a
per
se
rule
in
the
petitioner's
favor.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
almost
a
per
se
rule
that
you're
arguing
for
in
your
favor,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
know
of
another
one
in
the
law.
