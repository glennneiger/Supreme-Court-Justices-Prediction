but
the...
tavares
was
a
pure
403
case,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
i
think
i
remember.
i
think
i
was
on
the
panel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
pure
403.
it
says
that
in
the
presence...
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
you
can
keep
the
prejudicial
thing
out.
you
can
redact
it.
there
may
be
dozens
of
ways,
and
if
the
defendant
comes
in,
offers
to
stipulate,
then
there's
just
one
additional
important
way
that
the
government
doesn't
need
it,
and
that
goes
in
the
403
balance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
a
relevant
part.
the
relevant
part
is
that
the
felony
was
committed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is,
how
do
you...
i
mean,
the
question
is,
how
do
you
get
in
that
relevant
part
without
going
into
all
the
details,
and
the
difference
between
doing
that
with
an
ancient
felony
and
doing
it
with
the
details
of
the
accused
felony,
i.e.
the
present
crime,
the
difference,
because
you
don't
allow
it
with
the
present
crime,
i
thought
the
chief
justice's
question
is,
why
do
you
allow
it
with
the
past
crime,
and
the
answer
to
that
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
second
part
was
that
by
and
large,
with
the
exception
whether
it's
an
antitrust
violation
or
not,
you
know,
by
and
large
it's
not
relevant
except
for
the
fact
that
it
was
committed,
and
the
third
reason
was,
by
and
large
it's
very
prejudicial.
all
right,
so
you
add
those
three
things
together,
and
the
fourth
reason
was,
it's
easily
separable
from
the
rest
of
the
case,
very
administrable,
people
won't
get
mixed
up.
they
added
those
four
things
together,
and
then
the...
we
said
in
tavares,
we
are
not
saying
the
government's...
the
stipulation
has
to
be
accepted.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
accepted,
but
if
it's
offered
and
the
government
refuses
to
accept
it,
at
that
point
the
judge
in
his
403
exercise
of
discretion
should
require
the
government,
if
it
wants
to
prove
the
point,
to
submit
or
redact
it,
a
piece
of
paper
telling
of
the
fact
of
conviction.
all
right.
now,
i'm
bringing
that
up
because
i'm...
that
was,
of
course,
before
how
we
balanced
this
difficult
case
and
came
out
with
it,
and
i
want
to
know
specifically
why,
which
of
course
you
don't
accept
that,
and
i
just
want
you
to
focus
directly
on
that
and
explain
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not...
we're
trying
to
get
a
rule.
i'm
saying
that
was
the
general
rule
for
these
cases
that
came
up
all
the
time,
and
they
come
up
all
over
the
country,
and
the
different
judges
in
the
different
circuits
are
treating
them
differently,
so
i'd
say
why
don't
you
focus
on
tavares,
which
would
be
most
helpful
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
go
back...
can
i
ask
you
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question
for
a
second,
because
i
had
thought
that
it
was...
you
said
on
the
question
of
unfair
prejudice
the
reason
that
i
think...
and
at
the
heart
of
tavares,
frankly,
i
think
is
that
issue,
and
what
we
thought
was
the
unfair
prejudice
was
this.
even
if
you
assume
it
is
relevant
to
show
it
isn't
an
antitrust
violation,
which
is
i
guess
the
only
way
in
which
it's
relevant,
that
it
isn't
a
business
violation...
there
was
an
argument
in
the
court
about
that.
we
did
think
that
there
was
tremendously
unfair
prejudice,
and
the
reason
that
it
was
unfair
prejudice
was
because
there
would
be
concern,
as
the
policy
of
rule
404
suggests,
that
a
jury
uncertain
about
whether
the
person
committed
the
crime
in
front
of
them...
in
front
of
them.
you
know,
the
present
crime...
might
think,
well,
i've
just
learned
he
was
a
triple
ax
murderer,
he
was...
in
fact
had
loads
of
drugs
previously,
in
fact
beat
his
family,
in
fact
did
seven
other
really
quite
bad
things
previously,
and
therefore,
although
i,
the
juror,
am
uncertain
about
whether
he
committed
the
present
crime,
he's
a
bad
guy,
we'll
put
him
away.
i
mean,
it's
that
kind
of
unfair
prejudice
that
we
thought
might
flow
from
introducing
the
irrelevant,
except
for
antitrust,
fact
of
the
nature
of
the
previous
crime.
so
i'm
putting
that
in
front
of
you
so
you
can
then
respond
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
we
thought
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
per
se
answer
for
your
position,
and
that
tavares
is
based
on
an
assessment
of
the
likelihood
of
prejudice
that
the
two
arguments
don't
quite
meet.
i'm
not
saying
it's
not
responsive,
but
it
does
leave
one
with
the
lingering
feeling
that
there's
going
to
be
unfair
prejudice
in
some
cases,
and
you
say
that's
just
the
way
the
statute
works.
