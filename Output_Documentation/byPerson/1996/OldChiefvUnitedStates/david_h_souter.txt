justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
donovan,
when
the
judge
had
said
no,
did
you
then
offer
the
statement
as
a
signed
admission,
even
though
the
government
had
not
stipulated
to
its
correctness?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
agree
that
the
government...
i
mean
the
stipulation
is
by...
i
think
is
by
definition
a
statement
in
which
each
party
concurs.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
presume
there
isn't
any
power
in
a
court
to
make
the
government
concur
in
something
it
doesn't
want
to
concur
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
problem
doesn't
arise
under
the
rule
until
there
is
at
least
some
alternative
evidence
under
the
rule,
and
if
you're
saying
the
evidence
is
the
stipulation,
and
the
government
hasn't
signed
it,
you
haven't
got
a
stipulation,
and
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
evidence.
and
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question,
when
the
government
wouldn't
stipulate
so
that
you
couldn't
offer
a
stipulation,
did
you
have
a
kind
of
fallback
evidence
like
saying,
okay,
judge,
we've
signed
it,
and
my
client
has
signed
a
statement
saying,
i
did
thus
and
so,
or
i
was
convicted
of
thus
and
so,
and
we're
offering
this
as
evidence
as
an
admission.
that,
i
presume,
would
have
been
evidence,
but
i
take
it
that
was
not
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
in
the
nature
of
an
admission,
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
donovan,
i
want
to
get
clear
on
what
happened
in
this
case,
because
in
responding
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
general
rule,
i
think
you're
talking
about
a
case
which
as
you
described
it
was
different
from
what
you
described
to
me
earlier.
i
take
it
in
this
case
you
said
we
are
prepared
to
stipulate.
the
government
said
no,
we
won't
stipulate.
we
won't
sign
this
document,
or
whatever
you
wanted
it
to
agree
to,
and
the
judge
said,
okay,
they
don't
have
to.
that's
the
end
of
that.
your
response
came
in
effect
later
on
when
you
said
i
would
like
a
jury
instruction.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
what
happened?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
that
what
happened?
did
you...
let
me
put
it
the
other
way,
then.
did
you
ever...
when
the
government
said,
i
won't...
we
won't
stipulate,
did
you
ever
say
to
the
judge,
all
right,
we
will
sign
an
admission
or
make
an
admission
in
open
court
in
some
fashion
that
in
fact
he
was
convicted
and
he
has
this
status.
did
you
ever
offer
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
that
probably
moves
things
right
along.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
there
was...
what
if
there
was
the
written
admission?
the
government
offers
the
paper,
exactly
what
you
want
it
to
be
able
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'll
grant--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'll
grant
you
that
as
a
general
principle,
but
how
does
it
square
with
what
you
said
before,
because
i
thought
you
said
before
that
in
the
instance
in
which
the
written
admission
is
offered
so
that
it's
evidence
within
the
meaning
of
rule
403,
that
there
would
at
least
have
to
be
a
403
balancing.
are
you
saying
now
that
although
there
would
have
to
be
a
403
balancing,
your
interest
in
structuring
your
own
case
is
such
that
you
will
always
win
that
balancing?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
that's
not
much
of
a
balancing.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you're
saying
you
win
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
mean,
i
assume
balancing
means
there's
a
real
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
extreme...
mr.
estrada,
isn't
the
extreme
unlikelihood
of
success
in
inviting
doubt
about
either
a
stipulation
or
an
admission
what
takes
the
stipulation
and
the
admission
about
a
status
out
of
what
might
be
a
general
rule
in
your
favor
about
proving
the
elements
of
the...
or
the
case
in
the
sense
of
the
acts
of
the
defendant
in
this
particular
instance?
isn't
it
unlikely
that
they
will
doubt
the
one,
more
likely
that
they
will
doubt
the
other,
and
that
is
why
bloodless
and
nonprejudicial
evidence
is
more
justifiable
in
the
first
case
than
in
the
second
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
your
answer
is
that
the
evil
that
men
do
live
after
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-6556,
old
chief
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
johnny
lynn
old
chief
was
charged
in
federal
district
court
with
being
a
felony
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
at
trial,
old
chief
offered
to
concede
his
felon
status
and
on
that
basis,
he
sought
to
prevent
the
government
from
entering
into
evidence
the
record
of
his
prior
conviction
for
the
assault
resulting
in
serious
bodily
injury.
he
claimed
that
telling
the
jury
the
name
and
nature
of
his
prior
offense
would
unfairly
prejudice
him
within
the
meaning
of
federal
rule
of
evidence
403,
but
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
government
was
entitled
to
prove
every
element
of
the
offense
with
its
own
chosen
evidence
and
was
not
required
to
accept
old
chief’s
concession
in
its
place.
old
chief
was
convicted
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
hold
that
the
district
court
has
used
its
discretion
when
it
sprung
old
chief’s
offer
to
provide
the
government
with
virtually
conclusive
evidence
of
his
felony
status
and
instead
permitted
the
government
to
proceed
with
evidence
of
the
name
and
nature
of
old
chief’s
prior
felony.
we
agree
with
the
general
rule
that
a
criminal
defendant
cannot
interfere
with
the
government’s
presentation
of
its
evidence
by
conceding
some
elements
if
not
others
but
we
find
that
the
reason
for
that
rule
does
not
apply
to
prove
of
legal
status
resulting
from
a
previous
unrelated
adjudication.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas
join.
