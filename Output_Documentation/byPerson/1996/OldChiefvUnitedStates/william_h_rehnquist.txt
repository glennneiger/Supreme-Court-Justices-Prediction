chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-6556,
johnny
lynn
old
chief
v.
united
states.
mr.
donovan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
we're
talking
about...
we're
talking
about
admissibility
of
evidence,
here,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily
you
don't
start
talking
about
the
relevance
of
a...
you
look
at
the
piece
of
evidence
and
you
say,
is
it
relevant,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
it,
a
certificate
of
prior
conviction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
raised
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
the
question
is,
if
the
defendant
in
a
felon
in
possession
of
firearms
case
offers
to
stipulate
to
his
status
as
a
felon,
should
the
district
court
require
the
government
to
accept
the
stipulation.
so
it's
no
different
whether
the
judge
read
the
indictment
or
whether
there
was
a
certificate
of
prior
conviction,
is
there,
under
that
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your...
the
question
you
raise
with
us
is
whether
the
government
should
have
been
required
to
accept
the
stipulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
we're
talking
now
about
a
piece...
what,
a
certificate
of
conviction
of
some
sort
was
offered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
was
it
that
the
government
offered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
so
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you're
talking
about
normal
application
of
the
rules
of
evidence,
is,
is
this
judgment
of
conviction
relevant,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
answer
yes,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't...
excuse
me.
supposing
that
a
criminal
defendant
is
charged
with
the
offense
of
murder,
is
the
government
required
to
simply
accept
a
statement
from
him
that
yes,
i
killed
this
person,
rather
than
have
the
evidence
put
on
by
the
government
as
to
how
the
person
was
killed,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why...
if
you're
right
on
the
felony
point,
why
isn't
the
government
required
to
accept
a
stipulation
on
some
other
element
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe...
can't
the
defendant
in
my
hypothesis
argue
that
this...
the
evidence
as
to
how
he
killed
the
defendant
could
be
very
prejudicial,
and
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
so
long
as
he
killed
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
this
evidence
is
relevant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
certainly
isn't
the
question
you
present
us
with.
it's
whether
that
ninth
circuit
decision
might
be
wrong.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
criminal
defendant
and
his
lawyer
figure
that
our
only
chance
is
to
raise
a
defense
of
justifiable
homicide,
that
you
killed
in
self-defense,
can
that
defendant
come
in
and
say,
i
stipulate
to
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
murder,
that
it
was...
i
killed
him
unlawfully,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
and
can
the
government
be
required
to
accept
that
sort
of
stipulation,
and
only
argue
about...
the
only
evidence
you
really
hear
is
about
whether
there
was
justification
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
can't
it
present
a
full
picture
of
the
felony
that
the
person
was
convicted
of?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it's
not
relevant,
then
you
don't
ever
get
to
a
403
balancing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
simply
would
exclude
it
automatically.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--on
a
somewhat
broader
picture,
can
the
criminal
defense
in
a
sense
require
the
government
to
accept
a
lot
of
stipulations
so
that
a
very
abstract
picture
is
presented
to
the
jury
simply
almost
in
terms
of
judges,
rather
than
having
live
evidence
describe
what
happened?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
were
to
rule
in
your
favor
in
this
case
and
then
a
year
from
now
you
get
a
defendant,
maybe,
and
the
felony...
a
similar
charge,
the
felony
of
which
he's
convicted
is
having
trafficked
in
counterfeit
louis
vuitton
bags.
and
this
time
the
government
wants
to
stipulate
what
the
felony
is,
and
you
say,
no,
i
think
the
jury
should
know
that
this
guy
was
just
trafficking
in
counterfeit
louis
vuitton
bags.
[laughter]
or
short
lobsters.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
defendant
couldn't
make
that
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
a
practical
matter,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
stipulate,
you
agree.
under
your
view,
what
can
the
government
bring
in
to
prove
the
prior
felony
that
you
think
would
be
permissible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
are
superior
to
the
certificate?
because...
and
i
suppose
the
clerk
could
not
be
asked
what
the
prior
felony
was?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
know
it
was
felony?
would
the
clerk
of
the
court
know
it
was
a
felony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
offense
which
shall
remain
nameless
was
a
felony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
other
party
can
be
required
to
accept
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
all
you
can
do
then
is
object.
you
can't
argue
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
such
a
thing
in...
is...
what
has
been
referred
to
as
a
written
admission,
is
there
any
recognition
of
that
sort
of
an
instrument
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
comes
under
the
rules
of
evidence.
could
i
ask
you,
we
found
this...
i
still
find
it
quite
a
difficult
case.
in
tavares
the
circuit
felt
that
we
had
to
answer
the
question,
pure
403
question.
you
could
say
leave
it
up
to
the
judges,
but
we
felt
we
had
to
answer
it
because
these
cases
came
up
all
the
time
and
different
judges
were
making
in
the
mill,
mine-run
average
case,
the
same
calls
differently,
so
we
thought
we
had
to
answer
it,
telling
them
how
they
should
exercise
their
discretion,
either
let
it
in
or
don't
let
it
in.
and
i
guess
we
are
in
that
same
boat
here,
though
normally
403
is
just
up
to
the
district
judge,
but
if
we
have
to
answer
it,
and
i
guess
we
do,
we
ultimately
in
the
first
circuit
said,
well,
there
are
four
special
things.
of
course
the
government
can
present
anything,
it's
normal
order
of
proof,
all
the
facts,
et
cetera,
but
here
the
reason
for
that
rule
doesn't
apply.
the
reason
was
to
give
the
government
a
chance
to
present
the
full
picture.
that
reason
doesn't
apply.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
ask
for
a
rule
broader
than
the
question
raised
by
the
petition--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that
doesn't
necessarily
change
the
proposition
that
we
decide
only
the
question...
we
may
do
it
by
invoking
a
broader
rule
than
necessary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
donovan,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
did
refuse
to
stipulate
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
