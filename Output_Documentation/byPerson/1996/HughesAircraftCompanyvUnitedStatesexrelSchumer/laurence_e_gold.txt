mr.
laurence
e.
gold
two
things,
if
i
could,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
when
the
case
was
brought,
the
audit
reports
within
the
government
had
not
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
government
had
saved
money--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--but
rather
that
the
government
had
lost
money.
secondly,
if
in
the
end
the
only
claim
left
here
is
the
claim
based
on
the
improper
cost
accounting
disclosure
statement,
we
presume
that
all
that
would
be
at
issue
in
terms
of
the
liability
would
be
the
penalty
provision
for
filing
a
false
claim.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
it
is
still...
at
the
time
it
was
$2,000...
a
false
claim,
and
i
think
the
point
of
this,
justice
o'connor,
is
shown
first
of
all
by
the
particular
provision
we
have
here
in
the
background,
or
as
we
emphasize
in
our
brief,
a
case
like
the
rohleder
case
in
the
third
circuit,
where
the
contractors
certified
that
subcontracts
had
been
let
as
was
required
by
the
government
regulations
through
competitive
bidding,
when
in
fact
they
hadn't.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
and
getting
those
from
the
plaintiff's--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--point--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
but
also
from
the
point
of
view
it
is
not...
from
the
plaintiff's
point
of
view
it's
not
much
of
an
enrichment.
it's
a
nonloss
for
having
gone
forward.
i
don't
say
it
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
and
if
i
could,
and
then
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
law
issues
here,
the
two
issues
left
in
this
case.
the
other
one
on
which
there
are
no
audit
findings,
and
on
which
if
you
compare
the
original
northrop
request
for
an
audit
with
the
final
audit
reports
there's
nothing
but
confusion,
is
whether
hughes
misled
northrop
in
terms
of
what
costs
would
be
charged
to
the
radar
development
for
the
b-2,
and
whether
that
generated
false
claims.
now,
there
is
nothing
in...
there
is
nothing
but
discord
at
this
point,
and
that's
why
the
ninth
circuit
sent
that
issue
back,
and
therefore
there
may
be
real
money
here.
that's
just
not
clear
yet.
there
are
two
claims,
one
of
which
rests
on
the
issue
that
the...
that
hughes
has
brought
up
here,
the
disclosure
statement
issue,
and
on
that
our
position
is
that
if
the
government
requires
as
a
condition
of
contracting
that
you
provide
certain
accurate
information
in
order
to
safeguard
the
contracting
system
and
to
assure
that
the
charges
are
proper
charges,
and
if
you
knowingly
provide
false
and
incomplete
and
misleading
statements
and
certifications,
then
there
is
a
false
claim,
and
that
is
true
whether
or
not
the
claim
is
overstated.
so
we
think
the
answer
to
the
sole
question
that
the...
that
hughes
raises
in
this
regard
is
no.
in
that
situation
the
false
claims
act
does
apply,
and
it
generates
at
least
the
penalty
which
assures
the
integrity
of
the
contracting
system
and
provides
the
government
that
kind
of
benefit,
and
that's
true
whether
it's,
you
have
to
show
us
what
your
cost
accounting
system
is,
or
you
have
to
let
subcontracts
by
competitive
bidding,
or
you
have
to
tell
us
what
the
qualifications
of
certain
employees
are
if
they're
to
be
paid
a
premium.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
third
question.
if
i
can,
now,
going
rapidly
backwards,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
first
question.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
when
you
change
a
jurisdictional
bar,
which
we
think
it's
fair
to
call
this...
i
mean,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
merits...
in
a
way
which
makes
it
easier
for
plaintiffs
to
bring
suit,
opens
the
courthouse
door,
you
have
some
effect
on
the
legal
regime.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
don't
believe
it
takes
away
a
defense.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
you
had
a
defense
in
terms
of
saying,
this
person
cannot
be
a
plaintiff.
you
didn't
have
a
defense
if
what
you
disclosed
to
the
government
caused
the
government
to
understand
that
you
had
made
false
claims
on
it,
and...
because
the
government
could
sue.
and
the
change
here
in
terms
of
opening
the
door
to
the
courthouse
to
individuals
who
would
otherwise
be
subject
to
a
bar
is
one
which
doesn't
change
the
underlying
rights,
doesn't
change
the
underlying
duties,
and
in
this
case,
since
there
can
be
only
one
suit
for
false
claim,
whether
it's
brought
by
the
government
or
a
relator,
it
doesn't
change
the
liability.
indeed,
it
doesn't
even
necessarily
change
the
plaintiff,
because
the
government
can
take
over
any
case
brought
by
a
relator,
so
i
do
think
that
what
you
have
here
is
not
a
creation
of
a
new
cause
of
action
as
in
the
statute
of
limitation
revivor
case,
but
a
true
rule
regulating
the
procedural
and
jurisdictional
rules
of
the
court.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
you...
if--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--if
you
had
a
situation
in
which
you
disclosed
to
the
government
your
prior
nondisclosure,
the
government
certainly
could
act
to
bring
the
suit.
in
other
words--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
there's
simply
no
violation.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
under
any
regime.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
i...
i
would
not
want
to
say
that.
i
don't
think
that's
right.
it
made
a
change
in
the
rules
concerning
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
entertain
suits
brought
by
a
private
relator
on
behalf
of
the
government.
it
did
not
change
any
underlying
substantive
rule,
and
it
did
not
change
in
any
way
the
government's
preexisting
and
pre-1986
and
post-1986
rights
to
go
into
court.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
there's
no...
if
the
government
brings
the
first
case,
there
can
be
no
relator.
if
one
relator
brings
a
case
there
cannot
be
a
second
or
third
relator,
and
if
a
relator
brings
a
case,
the
government
can
always
take
it
over.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
proposition
that
you
can
after
the
fact,
which
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
tell
the
government
something
and
save
yourself
from
liability
is
simply
an
erroneous
statement.
the
government--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--there
is
a
retroactive
change
in
terms
of
the...
the
openness
of
the
courts
to
the
private
party.
if
that
kind
of
change,
which
seems
to
me
also
to
be
true
of
taking
the
jurisdictional
amount
out
of
the
federal
question
jurisdiction
which
was
done,
or
a
change
which
otherwise
creates
the
ability
after
the
fact
of
somebody
else
to
sue
where
before
only
the
united
states
could
sue--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
two
things,
if
i
could,
because
i'm
down
to
my
last
5
minutes.
one
is
that
there
is
no
showing
that
government
contractors
after
the
fact
made
these
representations
to
the
government
in
order
to
cut
off
qui
tam
relators,
and
there's
no
showing
that
hughes
made
any
such
showing.
all
of
this
came
out
in
the
fullness
of
time,
and
no
showing
that
the
government
didn't
act
after
the
fact,
if
you
came
in
and
you
said
we
knowingly
gave
you
false
statements,
or
we
knowingly
misled
a
contractor,
and
i
don't
think
those
kinds
of
expectations
have
ever
been
seen
to
be
the
kind
that
are
protected
by
this
rule
of
fairness
on
public
disclosure.
the...
it
seems
to
us
the
critical
points
are
that
at
no
juncture
in
the
evolution
of
the
'86
jurisdictional
bar
provision
were
all
government
disclosures
a
basis
for
prohibiting
the
going
forward
of
a
qui
tam
suit.
at
every
stage,
the
forms
of
disclosure
which
led
to
the
bar
were
limited.
there
was
a
set
of
negotiations
which
are
not
public,
and
in
this
instance
as
opposed
to
landgraf
after
the
discussions
statutory
language
came
out
and
nobody
tried
to
explain
it.
everyone
seems
to
have
kept
their
word
that
the
statute
would
be
the
statute,
and
at
that
point
the
forms,
or
the
means
by
which
disclosure
could
be
made,
were
expanded.
but
at
the
very
same
time,
the
word
public
was
added
before
the
word
disclosure
for
the
first
time,
and
it's
just
impossible,
if
you
read
the
statute
for
what
it
tells
you,
to
say
that
a
disclosure
within
a
contractual
relationship
marked
confidential,
for
business
purposes
only,
in
the
only
way
that
a
disclosure
can
be
made
to
a
fictitious
entity
which
is
the
other
contracting
party,
namely
to
its
responsible
officials,
is
a
public
disclosure.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
in
the
peculiarities
of
this
case,
our
approach
and
the
government's
come
down
to
the
same
thing.
we
say
a
disclosure
within
the
contractual
relationship
as
such
is
not
a
public
disclosure.
the
government
says
a
disclosure
to
the
allegedly
wrongdoing
party
is
not
a
public
disclosure
and
here,
because
the
allegedly
wrongdoing
party
is
a
corporation,
the
disclosure
to
its
responsible
officers
is
the
only
way
you
can
make
such
a
disclosure.
i
would
point
out
that
the
government's
position
at
least
averts
the
problem
that's
inherent
in
the
tiny
bit
of
concession
that
the
petitioner
makes,
namely
that
the
petitioners
would
have
you
have
a
jurisdictional
inquiry
into
who
in
the
corporation
was
involved
in
the
wrong,
where
the
government
at
least
faces
up
to
that
problem.
