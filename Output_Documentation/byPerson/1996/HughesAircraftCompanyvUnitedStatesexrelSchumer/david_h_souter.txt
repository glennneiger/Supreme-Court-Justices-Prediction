well,
what
fairness
here
seems
to
be,
in
effect,
an
estimate
of
the
odds
of
getting
prosecuted,
or
the
odds
of
getting
caught.
that
is
not
what
we
normally
mean
by
fairness
in
this
context.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
defense
against
everybody,
isn't
it,
mr.
starr,
and
this
is
not
a
defense
against
everybody,
and
it's
a
defense
that
doesn't
have
any
relationship
to
the
primary
conduct.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
of
course,
your
answer
assumes
that
in
any
event,
even
under
the
old
regime,
the
government
could
have
sued
for
precisely
what
this
particular
relator
is
suing
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
there's
another
value,
and
that's
the
value
of
the
prosecution.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
amendment
allows
for
that
value
to
a
degree
that
the
prior
law
perhaps
did
not.
it's
not
just
information.
it's
prosecution.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
make
the
assumption
that
congress
did
not
also
have
the
purpose
to
encourage
prosecution?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
effect
of
a
disclosure
before
this
change
was
exactly
what
it
is
after
the
change,
and
secondly
you're
saying
there
is
no
provision
under
the
new
statute
for
a
relator
to
bring
an
action
if
the
government
couldn't
bring
an
action.
