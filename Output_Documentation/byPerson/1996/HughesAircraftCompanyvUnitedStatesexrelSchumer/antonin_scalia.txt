justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
starr--
--do
they
wipe
it
out
as
to
everyone,
or
do
they
wipe
it
out
as
to
suit
by
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
fact
he's
liable.
both
then
and
now
he
was
liable
for
the
same
conduct,
regardless
of
the
government's
knowledge.
i
think
the
argument
made
by
the
other
side
is
that
all
the
change
does
is
to
say
in
the
future
we're
going
to
let
private
people
bring
that
suit
as
well
as
the
government,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
starr,
you're
not
really
saying
that
they
can't
do
that.
you're
just
saying
that
if
congress
wants
to
do
that
it
has
to
make
it
clear.
congress
could
say,
this
statute
applies
to
acts
committed
before
the
private
right
of
action
is
created.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
not
speaking
of
the
constitutionality.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
starr,
suppose
congress
had
written
this
statute
3729(a)(1)
and
(2),
which
is
what
you're
addressing
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
the
word
public
in
it,
and
it
just
said,
no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
under
this
section
based
upon
the
disclosure
of
allegations
or
transactions
in
a
criminal,
civil,
or
administrative
hearing
and
a
congressional
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
so
forth.
how
would
that
differ
from
the
interpretation
you
were
giving
the
provision
with
the
word
public
in
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
an
administrative
investigation
doesn't
necessarily
mean
disclosure
outside
the
government,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
act
doesn't
just
say
false
or
fraudulent
claim,
it
says
a
false
or
fraudulent
claim
for
payment
or
approval.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
seek
approval
of...
you
know,
i
assume
that
means
approval
that
this
portion
of
the
job
has
been
fully
completed
satisfactorily.
would
that
be
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
a
claim
for
payment
or
approval.
what,
in
your
estimation,
does
or
approval
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
read
approval
to
mean,
approval
for
payment.
it
states
false
or
fraudulent
claim
for
payment
or
approval.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that.
that's
the
only
problem
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
gold,
i
expect
the
$2,000
is
peanuts
compared
to
what
else
you're
entitled
to,
and
that
is
the
costs
of
the
action,
the
costs
of
the
civil
action.
i
expect
that
by
the
time
the
discovery
that
the
government
hadn't
lost
any
money
was
made,
the
plaintiff
here
had
invested
well
in
excess
of
$2,000.
you
do
get
your
costs,
don't
you,
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
explains
why
the
suit
proceeds.
you
would
think
that
once
it
was
found
the
government
hadn't
lost
any
money,
it
would
say,
gee,
it's
not
worth
expending
a
lot
more
money
prosecuting
this
suit
for
$2,000,
but
you're
going
to
get
the
$2,000
plus
all
that
you've
spent
up
to
now
prosecuting
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
plus
what
you'll
spend
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gold,
would
you
explain
to
me
again
how
it
could
be
under
the
old
regime
that
if
i
was
a
contractor
and
i
disclosed
to
the
government,
i
could
nonetheless
be
held
liable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
the
false
claims
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
i
disclose
at
the
outset.
i
don't
have
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
the
old
regime.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
if
there's
just
a
violation
of
a
contract
term
that
is
so
minor
that
it
would
not
be
the
basis
for
the
government's
refusal
to
pay
the
contract
price?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
there
also
may
be
some
provisions
about
you
have
to
report
this,
that,
and
the
other
thing.
let's
assume
you
don't
report
one
thing.
i
wouldn't
think
in
the
ordinary
case
the
result
of
that
would
be
the
government
can
refuse
to
pay
the
entire
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
willing
to
be
committed
to
that.
it
has
to
be
the
condition
of
payment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
waxman,
before
you
do
that,
have
you...
are
you
changing
your
position
from
what
the
government...
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
government's
position
in
its
briefs.
i
thought
the
brief
was
not
whether
it's
disclosed
to
the
employee
as
an
employee
or
as
a
member
of
the
public,
but
rather,
whether
the
employee
to
whom
it
was
disclosed
had
an
obligation
to
keep
it
secret
or
was
free
to
disclose
it
to
the
rest
of
the
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
that
the
test
in
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
an
employee
means
he
acquires
it
by
reason
of
his
employment.
is
that
what
your
as
an
employee,
receives
it
as
an
employee
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
somebody
who
happens
to
be
a
messenger
in
the
company
happens
to
see
that?
it
wasn't
sent
to
him,
but
he
sees
it.
he
wouldn't
have
seen
it
except
that
he's
an
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
it's
a
clear
line.
[laughter]
this
is
what
i'm
worried
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it
has
nosy
messengers.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it
has
nosy
messengers.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
to
number
2,
that
depends
on
whether
you
want
to
be
realistic
or
not.
