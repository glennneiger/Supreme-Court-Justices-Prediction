mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
take
the
issues
presented
in
the
reverse
order,
if
i
may.
on
the
merits
as
to
the
third
point,
the
assertion
hughes
now
makes
as
opposed
to
the
assertion
it
made
in
its
petition
that
a
claim
under
the
false
claims
act
is
false
and
fraudulent
only
if
it
involves
the
submission
of
an
inflated
request
for
payment
is
quite
wrong.
as
this
court
stated
30
years
ago
in
united
states
v.
neifert-white
company,
"the
act
was
intended
to
reach
all
types
of
fraud,
without
qualification,
that
might
result
in
financial
loss
to
the
government.
"
"it
covers
all
fraudulent
attempts
to
cause
the
government
to
pay
out
sums
of
money.
"
that
interpretation
was
expressly
endorsed
in
the
senate
report
accompanying
the
1986
amendments,
and
it
is
consistent
with
virtually
every
decision
applying
the
act.
thus,
in
our
view,
whenever
a...
a
claim
is
false
or
fraudulent
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
whenever
it
knowingly
misstates
facts
bearing
on
the
claimant's
entitlement
to
payment
or
a
benefit,
regardless
of
whether
the
misstatement
relates
to
price,
the
character
or
quality
of
the
goods
or
services
provided,
the
eligibility
of
the
claimant
to
receive
the
benefit,
or
compliance
with
governing
laws,
regulations,
or
contract
terms.
turning
to
the
second
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
if
the
misstatement
could
not
as
a
matter
of
law
have
borne
on
the
entitlements
claimant,
or
entitlement
to
payment,
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
act,
and
there
are
many
statements
that
might
be
false
statements
under
1001
that
would
not
qualify.
i
mean,
if
i
misstate
my
social
security
number,
unless
there
is
a
very
strange
regulation
that
makes
it
a
condition
of
receipt,
it
wouldn't
be
a
false
claim.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
that's
right.
in
the
ordinary
case,
unless
it
was
made
an
express
or
implied,
under
the
law,
condition
of
payment,
it
wouldn't
relate
to
a
false
claim.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
it
has
to
bear
on
the
entitlement
to
payment
in
some
way.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
fact,
i
think,
although
the
courts
have
torn
themselves
inside
out
trying
to
determine
whether
in
this
provision
and
the
criminal
false
claims
provision
materiality
is
an
element,
in
fact,
to
the
extent
materiality
is
an
element,
it
really
is
embedded
in
the
test
of
whether
it
bears
on
entitlement
to
payment
or
a
benefit.
i
mean,
taking
this
court's
definition
from
gaudin
and
kungys,
the
natural
tendency
to
influence
or
be
capable
of
influencing
the
decisionmaker
seems
to
incorporate
this
test.
any
fact
that
bears
on
entitlement
is
one
that
is
capable
of
influencing.
with
respect
to
the
public
disclosure
bar,
we
believe
that
allegations
and
transactions
are
publicly
disclosed
by
the
government
whenever
they
are
revealed
to
a
member
of
the
public
outside
the
government
other
than
to
the
suspected
wrongdoer.
in
the
context
of
a
corporate
wrongdoer,
i
will
rush
to
the
test
that
justice
breyer
identified
as
a
clear
minimal
definition
and
state
that,
since
corporations
can
only
act
through
individuals,
the
test
should
be
whether
the
persons
to
whom
the
government
disclosed
the
allegations
or
transactions
received
the
information
in
his
or
her
capacity
as
an
employee
or
agent
of
the
corporation,
not
just
as
an
individual
who
happens
to
be
an
employee.
for
example--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
a
disclosure
to
northrop
would
be
in
most
instances
a
public
disclosure.
northrop
actually
is
the
whistleblower
in
this
case,
and
i
think
a
disclosure
to
northrop
or
northrop
employees
would
have
to
be
considered
a
disclosure
to
a
member
of
the
public,
in
this
case
the
paradigm
qui
tam
relator.
but
as
to
disclosures
to
employees,
and
i
know
it
is
very
important
for
this
court
to
announce
some
sort
of
bright
line
rule
so
that
we
can
apply
this,
this
provision,
let
me
give
you
some
examples
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
the
extent--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
was
some
language
in
our
brief
to
that
effect.
with
all
respect,
i
don't
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
was
the
burden
of
our
statement,
but
we...
in
an
effort
to
create
a
bright
line--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
are
saying
that
if
it's
disclosed,
either
by
the
government
or
by
hughes
management,
to
someone
in
the
corporation
because
they're
a
corporate
employee,
that's
not
public
disclosure.
on
the
other
hand,
if
someone
who
happens
to
be
a
public...
a
corporate
employee
files
an
foia
request,
and
obtains
it,
that
is
a
public
disclosure.
if
the
government,
the
attorney
general,
pursuant
to
her
authority
under
3733,
files
a
civil...
sends
a
civil
investigative
demand
out
to
persons
who
may
have
knowledge
of
the
alleged
wrongdoing
and
one
of
them
happens
to
be
a
corporate
employee,
that
is
a
public
disclosure.
if
a
dcaa
investigator
goes
out
and
talks
to
people,
some
of
whom
are
corporate
employees,
and
in
the
course
of
the
interviews
discloses
allegations
and
transactions,
that
is
a
public
disclosure.
that
was
the
second
circuit's
test
in
doe.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
receives
it
because
he
is
an
employee.
in
other
words,
hughes
general
counsel
sends
it
to
their
director
of
auditing
because
he
is
their
director
of
auditing
and
it's
his
responsibility
to
respond
to
the
dcaa's
charges.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
was
confident
we
would
get
into
some
hypotheticals.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my
clear
line
is
that
that
would
not
be
a
public
disclosure,
because
we
need
a
clear
line.
the
employee
was
there
because
he
was
an
employee.
he
was
performing
his
functions
as
an
employee,
and
if
he
happens
to
see
it,
that's
not
a
public
disclosure,
and
what
is...
although
this
is
a
clear
line,
it
leaves
contractors
like
hughes
the
ability
to
calibrate
the
universe
of
people
it
will
allow
to
see
these
reports.
hughes
could
decide
that
only
the
general
counsel
is
going
to
receive
this
report,
and
no
one
else
is
going
to
see
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
unless
it
has
nosy
messengers,
and
i
think
that
this
really
is
the
test
that
does
approximate
as
best
as
we
can
determine
what
congress'
intent
was
with
respect
to
the
changing
of
the...
just
changing
of
the
qui
tam
bar
from
government
information
to
public
disclosure.
with
respect
to
retroactivity--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
think
that
the
statute
is
not
truly
retroactive
even
taking
your
point
about
the
defense
as
against
a
qui
tam
relator,
because
this
court
stated
in
landgraf
that
a
statute
has
genuine
retroactive
effect
only
where
the
statute
would
either
impair
rights
a
party
possessed
when
he
acted,
increase
a
party's
liability
for
past
conduct,
or
impose
new
duties
with
respect
to
transactions
already
completed.
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--here,
application
of
the
new
qui
tam
provisions
will
not
impair
any
legal
rights
that
hughes
possessed
when
it
acted,
it
will
not
increase
any
hughes
legal
liability
for
its
past
conduct,
and
it
will
not
impose
any
new
legal
duties
on
hughes
with
respect
to
transactions
already
completed.
we
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
yes,
but
this
court
did
say...
i
do
want
to
be...
i
want
to
be
very
realistic,
and
i
think
this
court
in
landgraf
was
realistic
in
saying
a
statute
does
not
operate
retrospectively
merely
because
it
upsets
expectations
based
in
prior
law.
the
test
is
whether
it
has
new
legal
consequences,
not
practical
consequences
but
new
legal
consequences.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
cause
of
action
here
is
a
cause
of
action
under
the
false
claims
act.
that
action
never
lapsed,
and...
may
i
finish
my
answer?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and,
indeed,
even
under
the
prior
regime,
if
mr.
schumer
had
filed
an
action,
and
it
turned
out
the
information
was
in
the
government's
files,
we
could
have
taken
over
the
case
and
it
would
have
proceeded.
thank
you.
