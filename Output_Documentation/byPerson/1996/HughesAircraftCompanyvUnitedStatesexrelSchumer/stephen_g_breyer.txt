before
you
leave
that,
could...
if...
suppose
we
were
to
disregard
the
label,
jurisdictional
or
not,
and
look
at
it
under--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
that
in
looking
to
see
whether
it's
retroactive
or
not
you
don't
necessarily
look
just
to
the
label,
which
is
what
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
we
were
to
look
at
whether
there
was
fair
notice,
reasonable
reliance,
and
the
settled
expectations
of
your
client,
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
landgraf.
all
right.
on
the
one
had,
they
know
they're
not
supposed
to
make
false
statements,
whoever
can
sue
them,
but
you
think
that
in
fact
this
change
as
to
who
can
sue
makes
a
material
difference
as
to
how
they
behave.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
to
how
they
would
have
behaved
had
they
only
known.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
explain
how.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
put
the
question
differently--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
i'm
trying...
suppose
you
find
out
that
the
justice
department
hires
50
more
lawyers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
would
say
that
that
makes
any
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
although
individuals
might
think,
oh,
boy,
i
better
really
be
careful.
all
right.
how
is
this
different
from
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is,
what
practical
difference
does
it
make
to
your
client,
had
your
client
known
in
advance
that
this
new
law
would
have
governed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
other
than--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
are
50
more
lawyers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
there
such
a
thing
as
an
audit
or
investigation
where
they
don't
even
tell
the
person
audited?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
you'd
do
that.
i
guess
there
could
be
such
a
thing,
but...
you're
saying
congress
could
possibly
have
just
wanted...
it
was
trying
to
distinguish
cases
where
you're...
the
very
object
of
the
investigation
being
told
the
result
of
the
investigation,
the
wrongdoer,
is
enough
to
make
it
public
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
just
saying
in
your
view--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
your
view,
it
makes
it
public
if
you
just
tell
the
corporate
entity
being
investigated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
why
isn't
it
a
perfectly
minimal
definition
of
public
to
say
that
disclosure
to
the
public
at
least
means
disclosure
to
a
person
who
is
not
the
wrongdoer,
which
could
include
an
employee,
provided
he's
being
disclosed
in
his
capacity
as
member
of
the
public,
such
as
he
independently
gets
it.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
clear,
minimal
definition,
though
i
imagine
you'd
lose
on
that
definition
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
if
you're
interested
in,
say,
a
clear
rule
of
law
that's
minimal
and
satisfies
all
your
requirements,
why
wouldn't
that
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they're
saying,
i
think,
which
is
bothering
me
too,
that
it
just
isn't
fair.
you
see...
and
that's,
i
think,
relevant,
because
after
all
a
statute
of
limitations...
suppose
congress
passed
a
statute
of
limitations
and
tried
to
revive
some
action
that
expired
in
1810?
i
mean,
i
don't
think
whatever
you
call
it
that
would
be
so
upsetting
of
reliance
interests
that
we
wouldn't
permit
it,
and...
i
don't
think...
and
so
they're
saying
here,
you
see,
it's
unfair.
we
had
this
defense
against
the
private,
and
we
had
a
course
of
action
telling
the
government
everything,
working
it
all
out
with
the
government.
we're
home
free.
and
now
we
don't.
so
is
it...
i
mean,
is
there
a
way
that
you
can
address
this
question
that
they
say
they
reasonably
relied
on
the
old
statutes,
it's
unfair
to
upset
that
reasonable
reliance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
does
it
work
with
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
how
does
reviving
an
action
by,
say...
statute
limitations,
10
years
later,
20
years
later,
congress
says,
oh
well,
we'll
change
it.
