mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
before
the
court
three
issues
under
the
false
claims
act
that
represents
the
court's
first
occasion
to
address
some
of
the
myriad
issues
which
have
arisen
under
the
1986
amendments
to
that
act,
and
beyond,
it
is
this
court's
first
qui
tam
case
since
world
war
ii.
two
of
the
issues,
the
meaning
of
the
public
disclosure
provision
of
the
1986
amendments
and
the
meaning
of
the
pivotal
bedrock
statutory
term,
false
claim,
are
of
enduring
and
high
practical
significance
to
the
law.
the
threshold
issue
in
the
case
is
retroactivity,
addressed,
of
course,
in
terms
of
first
principles
by
this
court
in
landgraf.
if
the
court
pleases,
i
will
speak
to
the
retroactivity
issue
before
turning
to
the
other
two
questions,
which
are
looming
large
nationwide
in
federal
court
litigation.
as
to
retroactivity,
although
issues
of
retroactivity
and,
indeed,
its
very
meaning
are
not
without
difficulty,
we
believe
that
this
case
fits
well
within
the
landgraf
analysis.
in
particular,
the
public
disclosure
provision
of
the
1986
amendments
did
something
very
specific.
it
eliminated
a
defense,
a
very
basic
defense,
namely
the
defense
of
government
knowledge.
that
is,
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
in
question,
hughes'
accounting
practices
under
a
variety
of
government
contracts,
the
fact
that
the
government
had
knowledge
of
the
information
or
the
allegations
would
constitute
a
complete
bar
to
mr.
schumer's
lawsuit.
the
1986
amendments
wipe
this
out,
thereby
expanding
the
circumstances
under
which
a
government
contractor
could
face
liability.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
government
knowledge
would
not,
of
course,
be
a
bar
with
respect
to
the
government.
the
government
can,
in
fact,
bring
a
false
claims
act--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
if
i
may,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
landgraf
analysis,
the
fact
that
you
are
permitting
private
parties
theretofore
barred
to
bring
the
action
is
indeed
an
additional
burden
using
the
judgmental
process
that
this
court
in
landgraf
said
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
the
key
distinction
is
the
fact
that
there
is
an
expansion
in
your
hypothetical
of
the
public
service,
which
is
quite
decidedly
different,
in
our
view,
than
empowering
private
individuals
who
do
not
take
the
oath
of
office
and
who
do
not
operate,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
case
after
case,
with
the
same
sort
of
strictures
that
a
public
actor,
a
public
official
acts
under.
it's
altogether
different
if
you're
in
fact
facing
the
united
states
government,
including
a
beefedup
united
states
government,
as
opposed
to
a
private
relator
who
is
motivated
by
an
entirely
different
set
of
motivations.
this
court
noticed...
noted
that
in
its
1943
opinion,
decision
in
marcus
v.
hess.
there
may
be
issues
or
motivations
of
greed,
or
an
effort
to
seek
vengeance
and
retribution
with
respect
to
a
particular
qui
tam
action.
those
are
inadmissible
qualities
of
an
orderly
public
prosecution
function,
and
there
are
any
number
of
safeguards
in
place
to
assure
that
the
public
prosecution
function
that
you
identified
is
in
fact
carried
out
within
the
context
of
a
culture
of
regulations
and
procedures
and,
indeed,
those
procedures
are
very
important.
it
was
justice
frankfurter
who
reminded
us
that
the
history
of
liberty
is
in
no
small
part
the
history
of
procedure.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
seems
to
us
that,
while
that
is
a
more
difficult
question
in
terms
of
the
creation
of
that
sort
of
private
right
of
action,
yes.
we
believe
that
under
a
landgraf
analysis
that,
in
fact,
is
going
to
a
very
material
change
in
the
exposure
of
the
defendants
in
an
analytically
distinct
way.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
this
is
not
a
turner-ellicorn
due
process--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--issue
at
all.
we
are
speaking
of
what
is
the
default
presumption,
and
we
think,
just
in
terms
of
fairness
considerations,
this
court
went
to
some
length
in
its
landgraf
opinion
to
talk
about
fairness
and
the
burdens
to
the
parties
who
are
affected
by
this,
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is...
i
accept
the
point
that
the
odds
of
getting
caught
would
not,
i
believe,
harkening
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
hypotheticals,
carry
the
day
for
me.
justice
souter,
it
is
only
if
you
accept
what
we
believe
is
an
established
proposition
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
an
action
by
the
sovereign
is
qualitatively
different
than
an
action
by
a
private
actor
who
is
animated
by
a
different
set
of
considerations.
the
court
has
said
it,
and
we
believe
that
is
indeed
an
additional
burden
that
should
call
upon
congress,
as
justice
scalia
is
suggesting.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is,
what
should
be
the
default
presumption?
there's
no
indication
that
congress
believed
that
it
was
enabling
a
new
category
of
candidates
to
in
fact
look
retrospectively,
and
especially
in
this
context,
where
what
was
changed
in
the
law...
what
was
changed
in
the
law
was
the
fact
that
in
the
ongoing
relationship
between
the
government
contractor
and
the
government,
if,
in
fact,
'in
this
relationship
of
information
flow,
if
the
government
contractor
is
flowing
information
to
the
government
in
that
relationship,
that
contractual
relationship,
no
stranger
to
the
relationship
under
the
regime
that
existed
since
world
war
ii
could
then
come
into
federal
court
and
assail
a
particular
practice.
that
seems
to
us
to
be
a
fairness
consideration.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
this
court
has
said
with
respect
to
statutes
of
limitation
in
particular
that
the
elimination
of
that
kind
of
defense
does,
in
fact,
work
a
change,
and
should
not,
in
fact,
be
retroactively
applied.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
can
get
you
that
on
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
does
have
a
relationship,
justice
souter,
i
believe,
if
i
may
beg
to
differ,
with
respect
to
what
this
bar
is
all
about.
if
one
carefully
reads
3730(a)(4)(a),
it
is
about
the
disclosure
of
information.
who
originally
had
the
information?
the
information,
by
definition,
is
in
the
hands
of
the
government
contractor.
the
government
contractor,
under
a
regime
that
existed
for
40
years,
43
years,
knew
that
all
it
needed
to
do
was
to
keep
the
government
informed,
and
that
insulated
it
from
qui
tam
relator
exposure.
that,
to
us...
if
one
doesn't
accept
that,
that
is
our
submission.
we
think
that
is
in
fact
looking
to
the
underlying
conduct
of
what
the
contractor
is
doing
and
the
incentives--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
that
the
underlying
issue
could,
in
theory.
i
think
it
does
bear
noting
that...
and
this
moves
me,
if
i
may,
to
some
of
the
other
issues
in
the
case,
that...
and
what
was
congress'
policy
that
was
being
implicated
here?
congress'
policy
concern
was
that
there
were
not
enough
levels
of
activity
with
respect
to
ferreting
out
"fraud",
that
there
was
insufficient
government
action.
what
this
case
represents,
a
sort
of...
the
extreme
of
the
most
elaborate
and
careful
exacting
governmental
scrutiny,
and
that
in
the
context
of
highly
sophisticated
and
sensitive
government
contracts
where
there
is,
justice
souter,
a
flowing
of
information
continually,
including
with
governmental
auditors
resident
on
premises.
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
regime
that
i
think
the
concerns
that
were
animating
congress,
which
was
what?
we
want
to...
and
this
moves
me,
if
i
may,
to
the
public
disclosure
issue
and
the
meaning
of
false
claim.
with
respect--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
missed
the
first
part
of
your--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
makes
a
material
difference
as
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
makes
a...
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
makes
a
material
difference
in
terms
of
the
incentives
to
keep
the
government
apprised.
under
the
prior
regime,
one
has
an
enormous
amount
of
incentives,
and
obviously
i'm
speaking
in
the
abstract,
because
responsible
covernment
contractors
keep
the
government
informed,
and
what
is
at
issue
here
was
an
extraordinarily
hypertechnical
dispute
as
to
disclosure,
disclosure
that
was
ultimately
found,
of
course,
not
to
not
only
cost
the
government
any
money,
but
the
underlying
accounting
practice
actually
saved
the
government
money.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
in
the
context
of
highly,
shall
i
say
sensitive
and
important
projects.
what
it
does
do
under
the
prior
regime,
and
again,
it
troubles--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
agree.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
again--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--again,
it
seems--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
that
the
incentives
again
are,
with
respect
to
the
underlying
conduct,
keep
the
government
fully
informed.
there
was
an
additional
set
of
incentives
under
the
government
knowledge
bar,
because
as
soon
as
you
made
the
government
aware...
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
government
was
aware
or
not
with
respect
to
what
we
were
doing,
but
under
the
prior
bar,
as
soon
as
you
made
the
government
aware
of
it
you
were
free
and
clear.
it
was
air-tight.
that
strikes
us
as
a
material
difference.
with
respect,
if
i
may,
with
the
court's
permission,
move
to
public
disclosure.
the
ninth
circuit
here
in
a
very
important
ruling
in
this
respect
held
that
the
disclosure
of
allegations
concerning
these
accounting
practices
to
employees,
undisputed,
of
both
northrop
and
of
hughes
did
not
trigger
the
public
disclosure
bar.
now,
why
did
the
ninth
circuit
conclude
that?
it
concluded
that
those
employees
operate
within
what
the
court
called
a
closed
loop
of
secrecy.
this
holding,
with
all
respect
to
the
ninth
circuit,
is
not
moored
to
the
statute
at
all.
here,
and
simply
engaging
in
a
textual
analysis
and
then
i
would
like
to
move
briefly
to
the
policy,
there
was
a
disclosure
outside
of
the
government,
and
that
took
the
form,
or
in
the
vehicle
of
an
administrative
audit,
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
of
disclosure,
and
in
an
investigation,
another
enumerated
category.
those
categories
we
think
are
illuminating,
because
in
contrast
to
other
categories
such
as
the
news
media,
or
a
congressional
hearing,
or
a
congressional
report,
there
is
not
going
to
be
wide
dissemination
of
a
government
audit.
in
particular,
in
the
context
of
defense
contracting...
and
this
is
undisputed.
the
government
will
not
dispute
this.
the
dcaa,
the
defense
contract
audit
agency,
which
cleared
hughes
totally
and
said
thank
you,
you
saved
us
lots
of
money,
you're
terrific,
$15.4
million
now
goes
to
you.
that's
a
good
thing.
what
dcaa
also
said
is,
we're
not
going
to
be
issuing
press
releases
with
respect
to
that.
we
do
not
disseminate.
that's
dcaa
regulations.
congress,
of
course,
knows
what
its
own
entities
do
by
way
of
practice
and,
thus,
it
is
unrealistic
to
look
to
whether
the
general
public
would
know.
what
we
believe
the
statute
contemplates
is
divulgence
by
the
government
to
a
person
outside
of
the
government
in
one
of
the
vehicles
that
are
enumerated.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
it
is.
under
our
theory--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
it
is,
and
the
reason
that,
your
honor,
while
that
seems
counterintuitive,
we
think
a
careful
reflection
of
the...
both
congressional
purposes
but
also,
your
honor,
if
one
looks
at
the
rest
of
3730(e)(4)(a),
there
is
a
very
important
and
forgotten
person
in
the
drama,
and
that's
the
original
source.
this
statute
was
designed...
the
1986
amendments...
and
this
court
has
very
recently
said
you
want
to
look
to
the
purpose
of
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
was
changing
a
statute
or
enacting
it.
what
congress
was
getting
at,
and
one
can
say,
was
it
an
artful
way
or
not,
but
what
congress
was
getting
at
was
to
protect
original
sources,
and
those
are
defined
in
the
statute,
and
the
original
sources,
justice
ginsburg,
are
not
affected
by
your
hypothetical.
that
is
to
say,
that
would
exclude
anyone
in
the
universe
except
an
original
source
from
coming
forward
with
a
quit
tam
action
and
as
previously
stated
an
obvious--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
could
not
agree
more
in
the
normal
context.
if
one
simply...
and
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
have
very
ably
invited
the
court
to
focus
very
specifically
on
two
words.
we
believe
that's
not
a
correct
method
of
statutory
interpretation.
you
look
at
the
entire
provision,
and
then
you
also
look
at
something
that's
very
important.
very
briefly,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
the
1986
amendments
was
to
get
the
right
balance.
it
didn't
just
say
anybody
in
the
world
filed
a
qui
tam
action.
that's
terrific.
it
was
a
balance,
and
what
was
that
balance?
the
balance
was,
we
want
to
encourage
true
whistleblowers,
those
who
are
not
opportunistically
availing
themselves
of
material
that
is
already
available,
known
to
the
government.
that
doesn't
assist
in
ferreting
out--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
apparent
harshness
of
the
regime
that
i
am
espousing
and
that
you're
discerning,
justice
o'connor,
is
upon
reflection
true
to
congress'
intent.
if
one
examines
the
background
of
these
amendments,
one
sees
that
what
really
had
congress
concerned...
the
national
association
of
attorneys
general
was
up
in
arms
on
this.
this
is
undisputed...
was
state
of
wisconsin
v.
dean,
which
embodied
the
value
of
the
original
whistleblower.
that's
the
true
qui
tam
relator,
justice
o'connor.
that's
the
good
qui
tam
relator.
it
is
not
someone
who
is
not
adding
value
in
the
sense
of
bringing
information
to
light
that
is
otherwise
hidden.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
agree
with
that
as
well,
because
there
is,
in
fact...
but
i
don't
think
that
that
should
change
the
court's
disposition,
but
the
second
circuit's
approach
is
correct
and
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
is
wrong,
because,
in
fact,
of
the
concern
that
in
this
balance
that
the
public
prosecution
function
is
important,
but
it
in
fact
needs
to
be
supplemented
by
private
relators.
but
congress
has
been
making
a
qualitative
judgment
about
who
are
good
qui
tam
relators
and
who
are
not,
and
under,
justice
souter,
your
regime
a
relator
is
a
good
relator,
but
congress
didn't
make
that
policy
judgment.
it
has
said,
no,
we
want
to
bar
what
otherwise
would
not
be
brought
as
a
qui
tam
action
save
by
an
original
source
if
there
has
been
public
disclosure
in
one
of
the
exhibits,
and
that
was
its
way
of
overruling
state
of
wisconsin--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
an
administrative
audit
or
investigation.
there
were
two
forms,
justice
stevens.
air
force
first
classified
audits,
and
then
a
series,
all
before
the
qui
tam
action
was
filed,
and
that's
why
the
qui
tam
action
here
is
utterly...
not
only
worthless,
it's
counterproductive.
three
dcaa
audits,
finally
concluding
again
that,
not
that
it's
material
to
the
disposition
of
the
case,
but
that
hughes
had
in
fact
saved
the
government
money.
those
were--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
our
interpretation
does
not
rob
public
of
meaning
but
rather
it
seems
to
us
that
what
congress
is
getting
at
here
is
that
disclosure
outside
the
government.
we
believe
that's
the
most
natural
meaning.
whereas,
if
it
had
simply
said
disclosure,
but
not
public
disclosure,
that
could
very
naturally
be
interpreted
dcaa
informs--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
it
does
not,
but
there
has
to
be
disclosure...
the
point
is,
as
one
takes
the
entirety
of
the
provision,
there
must
be
a
disclosure,
then
apply
allegations
or
transactions
in
this...
so
under
my
interpretation
of
your
redrafted
statute,
justice
scalia,
it
might
very
well
be
that
under
this
disclosure
would
have
taken
place
if
there
was
a
communication
from
dcaa
to
the
air
force.
whereas
public
disclosure
to
us
means
a
divulging
of
information
outside
the
government,
which
is
what
happened.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
collapsed
the
object
of
the
wrongdoer,
which
is
a
"corporate
entity"
with
what
congress
was
trying
to
encourage--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--which
is
whistleblowers.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it
has
to
come
to
the
attention
of
an
individual
who
was...
we
believe
the
second
circuit
is
right
here,
which
is
the
most
natural
approach,
someone
who
is
not
involved--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
would
very
much
lose
because
of
the
last
part
of
your
definition.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
because
i
think
that
will
strike
a
very
different
balance
than
what
congress
struck,
justice
breyer,
because
what
you
will
be
doing
is,
in
fact,
encouraging,
quote,
whistleblowing
actions
by
individuals
who
have
no
information
to
provide
to
the
government.
remember,
what
is
the
value
here?
if
the
court
dwells
on
what
congress'
purpose
was,
congress'
purpose
was
encourage
whistleblowing.
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
there's
no
whistleblowing
going
on.
that's
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
a
balance.
i
do
agree
by
virtue
of
asserting
my
part
of
the
balance,
and
i
hope
that
when
the
other
side
stands
up
the
other
side
will
speak
to
the
important
part
of
the
balance
as
well,
which
is
avoiding
nonvalue-laden
qui
tam
actions.
there
is
simply
no
value,
congress
has
determined,
if
one
does
not
come
forward
with
information
that
is
useful
to
the
government
if
the
government
is
already
caught
on
the
trail
of
fraud,
save
again,
your
honor,
for
the
original
source,
which
is
pivotal
to
our
argument.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
if
there's
a
technical...
this
is...
if
i
may--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
underlying
problem,
your
honor,
is
in
fact
the
ninth
circuit's...
which
is
our
third
argument,
the
definition
of
false
claim
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
now
defined
it.
we
believe
that
in
the
context
of
government
contracting
that
there
must,
in
fact,
be
some
effect,
or
potential
effect
on
the
treasury,
that
you
are
submitting
a
claim
for
payment
of
money
to
which
you
are
not
entitled.
something
disentitles
you.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
in
this
case
that
is
not
necessary,
that
an
entirely
regulatory
violation
could
run
afoul
of
the
false
claims
act.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
depends
upon
whether
it
is,
in
fact,
a
condition
of
contracting
and
whether
there
is
a
falsity
that
affects
your
entitlement
to
claims.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
for
approval
simply
means
that
the
government
must,
in
fact,
say,
we
are...
we
have
your
request,
and
we
will
now
pay
or
approve
its
payment,
and
what
we
think,
your
honor,
the
difficulty
in
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done,
is
to
take
any
kind
of
violation,
whether
it
has
an
effect
on
your
entitlement
to
the
payment
or
approval
for
payment
and
says
regardless,
whether
it's
an
environmental
regulation,
if
it's
not
a
condition
for
contracting,
you've
stated
a
false
claims
act,
and
justice
o'connor--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--approval
for
payment.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
we
think
that
the
case
law,
your
honor,
is
very
clear
with
respect
to
what
the
nature
of
a
claim
is.
if
you
go
to
the
nature...
the
definition
of
a
claim,
a
claim
is
in
fact
a
request
for
payment
that
money
or
property
is
owed
by
the
government
to
the
claimant.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve...
the
remainder
of
my
time.
[laughter]
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
thank
the
court.
