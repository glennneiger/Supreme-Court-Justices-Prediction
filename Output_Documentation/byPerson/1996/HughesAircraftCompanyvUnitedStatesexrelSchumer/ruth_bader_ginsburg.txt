justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
starr,
the
conduct
that
can
be
charged
is
the
same,
but
in
one
case
you
have
the
government
as
a
prosecutor.
now
you
have
added
a
private
prosecutor.
how
does
that
differ
from
a
u.s.
attorney's
office
that
has
no
strike
force
at
the
time
a
crime
is
committed
and
then
beefs
up
with
a...
just
a
tremendous
high-powered
crew?
can
the
defendant
say,
well,
it
was
a
thin
prosecutor's
office
when
i
did
it,
and
therefore
you
can't
retroactively
set
the
strike
force
after
me?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
starr,
are
you
then
saying
that
if
the
government
agency...
let's
say
there's
an
antidiscrimination
law
that's
put
in
the
charge
of
a
government
agency,
and
then
congress
decides
to
add
on
to
that
a
private
right
of
action
because
the
agency
isn't
well-enough
staffed.
the
private
actors
who
are
given
a
private
right,
they
cannot
reach
any
conduct
that
occurred
before
the
private
right
was
created?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
starr--
--mr.
starr--
--with
respect
to
that,
just
a...
suppose
the
government
agency
gives
to
the
chief
auditor
of
the
company
a
report
and
says,
i
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
this.
that's
a
person
outside
the
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
a
public
disclosure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
one
person--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no
matter
how
high
up
in
the
company.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
did
use
the
words,
public
disclosure,
and
the
words
public
disclosure
generally
imply
something
more
than
tell
one
officer
of
the
company.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
say
if
there
were
additional
punitive
damages
that
would
be
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
up
the
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fact
that
there
are
going
to
be
more
litigation
costs--
