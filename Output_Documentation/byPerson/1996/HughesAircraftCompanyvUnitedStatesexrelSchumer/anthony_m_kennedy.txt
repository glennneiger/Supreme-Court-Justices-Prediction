justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
only
fairness.
i
suppose
it's
depriving
you
of
a
defense
you
earlier
had.
what's
your
best
case
for
the
fact
that
if
you're
denied
a
defense,
that
this
is
a
substantive
expansion
of
the
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
don't
argue
now
and
you
don't
argue
in
your
brief
that
it
gives
them
the
incentive
to
disclose
to
some
public
group
that
there
is
a
problem,
and
i
suppose
that
that's
because
that's
just
unrealistic?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
that
question,
mr.
gold,
it
seems
to
me
just
as
a
practical
matter
the
board
of
directors
of
a
defense
corporation
would
say,
you
know,
in
the
light
of
this
new
statute,
we
have
an
expanded
new
liability
for
punitive
damages.
we're
going
to
have
to
change
our
conduct
in
the
way
we
disclose.
a
defense
has
been
taken
away
from
us
so
that
the
law
has
changed.
in
lay
terms,
they
would
explain
it
that
way.
i
have
some
difficulty,
other
than
perhaps
the
winfree
case,
in
finding
a
case
that
would
support
that
theory.
that's
just
what
i'm
thinking
about
this
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
does
take
away
a
defense,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
previously
you
had
a
defense
if
you
disclosed
to
the
government.
now
you
don't
have
that
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
not
saying,
mr.
gold,
that
the
statute
made
no
change
by
eliminating
a
defense
that
had
previously
been
available.
that's
what
we're
trying
to
get
at
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
that
point,
with
respect
to
retroactivity,
assume
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
bar.
assume
we
think
that
congress
has
eliminated
a
defense.
should
the
statute
be
applied
retroactively?
