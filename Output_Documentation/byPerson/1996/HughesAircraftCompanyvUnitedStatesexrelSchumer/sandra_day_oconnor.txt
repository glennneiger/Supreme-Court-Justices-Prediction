justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
your
interpretation
may
mean
in
effect
is
that
for
almost
any
government
investigation,
or
audit
of
some
suspected
fraud
or
false
claim,
if,
in
conducting
the
audit
or
the
investigation
anyone
other
than
the
wrongdoer
is
asked
questions,
other
employees,
sub-employees,
any
employee,
then
it
seems
under
your
interpretation
it
virtually
wipes
out
an
audit
or
an
investigation
for
any
qui
tam
action,
ever,
because
inevitably
i
guess
some
employee
would
be
talked
to
who
wasn't
party
to
the
alleged
wrongdoing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
will
the
fact
that
in
fact
it
saved
the
government
money
at
the
end
of
the
day
result
in
some
reduction
of
the
ultimate
liability
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it's
technical,
because
i
just
don't
understand
the
real
effect--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
you
allow
the
suit
to
go
forward
at
the
end
of
the
day.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
that
penalty
if
no
money
is
lost--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
now
you're
ignoring,
i
think,
the
point,
which
is
if
you
fail
as
a
government
contractor
to
disclose
something
on
the
form
that
the
government
said
you
should
have
put
it
on,
and
the
contractor
later
realizes,
oh,
that
should
have
been
on
that
form
8929,
and
it
wasn't,
i'm
going
to
tell
the
government,
i
really
goofed,
i
made
the
mistake,
the
government
can
still
sue,
but
you've
told
'em.
but,
under
the
new
law,
no
qui
tam
action
could
have
been
brought
by
a
third
party
for
that
because
the
contractor
had
told
the
government.
yes,
the
government
could
file
a
suit,
but
a
disgruntled
employee
could
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
to
that
extent
there
is
a
retroactive
change,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
isn't
that
what
this
petitioner
is
coming
before
us
and
alleging,
that
until
the
1986
amendments
we
had
assumed
that
while
the
government
could
still
complain,
that
no
qui
tam
action
could
be
brought
by
this
particular
relator,
and
they
say
that
was
this
situation.
now,
could
it
possibly
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
definition,
because
as
i
read
the
briefs,
you
and
the
solicitor
general
have
a
different
approach.
