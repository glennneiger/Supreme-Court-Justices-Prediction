justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
your
position
raise
a
significant
takings
issue
right
off
the
bat?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
a
state
recognizes
a
community
property
interest
in
something
like
a
husband's
retirement
plan
or
other
assets
that
he
has
acquired
during
the
marriage
by
virtue
of
his
efforts,
that
law
creates...
a
community
property
law
would
create
a
property
right
in
the
spouse
to
half
of
whatever
that
asset
is,
and
along
comes
an
erisa
law
later...
after
this
marriage,
the
first
marriage
had
been
in
existence
and
she
had
an
interest
there,
along
comes
erisa.
you
say
it
preempts
it,
even
though
that
would
be
a
taking
of
her
interest.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
wrong
with
that
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that's
right,
but
even
if
it
were,
it
would
constitute
a
taking
of
the
wife's
interest
acquired
to
that
date.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
community
property
law
in
louisiana
she
owned
half
of
whatever
he
made
from
1949
till
erisa
at
least
was
passed,
and
erisa,
even
if
you
give
it
effect,
can't
take
that
without
giving
her
compensation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
at
all.
there's
a
statutory
argument
here
to
be
addressed
if
we
wish,
i
guess,
and
that's
whether
there
was
any
alienation
here
at
all
under
the
statutory
provision
in
erisa.
if
dorothy's
estate,
if
she
had
a
community
property
interest
in
part
of
what
was
distributed
to
isaac
by
virtue
of
louisiana
law,
when
she
dies,
why
doesn't
that
interest,
whatever
it
is,
just
continue
to
exist
as
part
of
her
estate,
and
once
there
is
a
distribution,
why
doesn't
her
estate
stand
in
her
former
shoes
and
say
part
of
that
is
mine,
and
she...
that
isn't
an
alienation
under
erisa.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
absolutely.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
absolutely.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
she
doesn't
interfere
with
anything.
just
at
the
time
of
his
death
her
interest
still
remains,
and
it
passes
to
her
estate.
there's
no
alienation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
focus
a
lot
on
the
1984
amendments
to
erisa,
but
i
thought
that
dorothy
boggs
died
in
1979,
so
how
could
that
affect
it?
how
could
that...
how
could
the
1984
amendments--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--construe
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
she
died?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
he
also
got
some
lump
sum
settlement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
some
stock
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
this
is
so
peculiar,
because
here
is
an
example
of
a
couple
who
were
married
for
many,
many
years,
until
the
first
wife
died,
and
under
community
property
law
in
louisiana
she
had
a
half
interest
in
all
that.
that's
acknowledged.
and
how
is
it
that
we
would
construe
erisa
to
preempt
that,
when
this
may
well
be
the
major
asset
of
the
couple,
indeed
their
only
greatest
asset
from
all
those
years
of
work,
and
you
want
us
to
say
that
congress
just
intended
to
wipe
that
out,
to
take
it,
even
if
it's
a
taking,
and
i
think
this
is
a
remarkable
construction
that
you're
asking
us
to
give
this
law.
in
erisa's
preemption
clause
this
court
has
been
careful,
has
it
not,
to
protect
the
role
of
traditional
state
provisions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
that,
do
you...
there's
been
a
taking
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
we
normally
would
avoid
resting
on
some
constitutional
ground
if
we
can
possibly
construe
the
statute
some
other
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
just
say
no
will.
she
died.
she
has
an
estate
left,
and
subsequently
he
dies.
now,
her
estate
surely
is
entitled
to
half.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
so
sure
i'm
willing
to
say
louisiana
could
have
done
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we've
got
these
indian
claims,
for
instance,
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--federal
efforts
to
prevent
further
fractionalization.
but
this
court
in
earlier
cases
has
certainly
recognized
a
property
interest
in--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
--no--
--the
lower
courts
now,
before
the
1984
amendments,
had
construed
the
statute
not
to
make
such
a
preemption.
this
court
hadn't
ruled
on
it.
but
then
congress
got
busy
and
said,
wow,
we've
created
a
problem
here,
let's
look
at
it,
and
they
passed
this
so-called
domestic
relations
order
notion
hoping
to
avoid
just
what
you're
talking
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
to
address
the
problem
of
the
first
spouse--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
the
dependent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
might
even
shoe-horn
this
into
that
domestic
relations
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
says
if
it's
made
pursuant
to
a
state
domestic
relations
law,
including
a
community
property
law,
and
it
says
that
any
court
in
the
state
can
issue
an
order
that
is
qualified
under
this
plan.
it
doesn't
limit
it
to
some
specialized
family
court,
or
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
it
also
defined
ultimate
payee
for
these
purposes
as
any
spouse,
former
spouse,
et
cetera.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
a
probate
court--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
says
any
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
includes
community
property
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
just
looking
at
the
provisions
of
the
1984
amendments.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
you
could
even
shoe-horn
this
into
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
piece
of
it.
part
of
it,
not
all
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
part
of
it,
not
all
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it?
it
is
part
of
the
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
a
claim
for
a
portion
of
the
annuity
payments
going
to
the
second
wife?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
kind
of
a
plan
was
this?
where
does
this
survivor's
annuity
come
from?
did
payments
come
from
isaac
during
his
life
that
went
into
a
specific
fund,
and
it
was
that
fund
that's
used
to
pay
out
the
survivor
benefits,
or
is
it
some
other
kind
of
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
out
of
any
specific
fund
that
matched,
dollar
for
dollar,
what
he
put
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
isaac
had
died
before
his
retirement
and
without
having
remarried?
would
his
heirs
have
received
anything?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
hadn't
remarried.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
he
died
before
any
survivor's
annuity
had
been
paid,
what
would
happen?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
his
heirs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
his
heirs
get
anything?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
they
be
entitled,
if
they
were
not
dependent
children,
to
any
portion
of
the
survivor's
annuity
in
that
circumstance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
she's
gone,
he's
gone.
there's
no
survivor.
there
are
no
survivors
except
adult
children.
what
happens?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
but
you
just
told
me
they
weren't
traceable.
you
know,
this
is
a
real
puzzle
to
figure
out,
and
if
you
acknowledge
in
the
circumstances
i
ask
about
that,
oh,
well,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
survivor's
annuity,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
creates
a
problem
then
when
the
first
wife
died.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i--
--i
thought
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
the
administrator
would
have
to
comply
under
present
law
since
'84
with
a
qualified
domestic
relations
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
this
is
not
a
qualified
domestic
relations
order,
then
where
does
that
leave
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--could
dorothy
have
given
her
interest
directly
to
the
sons
during
the...
before
the
retirement
of
isaac?
could
she
have
signed
a
deed
of
gift
to
her
sons?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
her
interest,
to
the
extent
she
had
one,
to
her
sons?
and
if
so,
would
that
require
the
pension
administrator
to
abide
by
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
will
that
possibly
be
an
alienation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wait
a
minute.
under
the
statute
it
would
be
payable,
a
certain
amount
to
the
husband,
and
thereafter
a
certain
amount
to
the
then
surviving
wife,
if
there
was
one.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
didn't
answer
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
deed
of
gift
to
children,
copy
to
administrator?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
alienation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
why
isn't
a
contemporary
testamentary
provision
an
alienation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
will
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
according
to
you,
in
this
situation
there
was
no
alienation
at
all
during
the
existence
of
the
plan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
isaac
had
retired,
and
he
got
whatever
he
got,
and
what
she
did
arose...
what
happened
arose
by
virtue
of
louisiana
law
after
the
benefits
had
been
distributed.
