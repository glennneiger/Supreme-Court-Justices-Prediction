ms.
marian

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
erisa
is
a
comprehensive
federal
program
designed
to
ensure
that
employees
and
their
beneficiaries
receive
their
retirement
benefits.
it
is
also
designed
to
be
applied
uniformly
throughout
the
country
so
that
employees
in
other
parts...
all
parts
of
the
country
are
treated
equally.
how
does
erisa
accomplish
this
goal?
by
preemption.
additionally,
congress
has
created
a
list
of
statutory
beneficiaries
who
are
entitled
to
receive
benefits
under
these
retirement
plans.
only
erisa-designated
statutory
beneficiaries
are
included
in
the
list,
and
only
those
beneficiaries
are
permitted
to
receive
benefits.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
i
don't--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--well,
there
are
two
problems.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions,
including
wissner
v.
wissner,
that
the
federal
program
does
not
constitute
a
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
this...
well,
at
the
time
that
erisa
comes
along
it
preempts
state
law,
the
state
community
property
law,
so
that
it
is
inapplicable.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
acquired
to
that
date.
well,
the
wife's
interest
that's
acquired
to
that
date
is
similar
to
putting
money
into
a
trust.
when
she
puts
this
money
into
the
trust,
she
becomes...
if
she
lives
long
enough
she
becomes
a
surviving
spouse
and
is
entitled
to
benefits
as
a
beneficiary.
erisa
speaks
in
terms
of
beneficiaries.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
her
compensation
was
the
anticipation
of
the
benefits
she
would
have
received
had
she
become...
had
she
lived
long
enough
to
receive
them
coming
out
of
the
back
end
of
the...
a
retirement
program.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
her
anticipated
benefits
were...
she
received
through
the
federal
program.
that
was
the
basis
in
the
wissner
case
that
said
that
the
retroactivity
in
that
case--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
benefits
she
would
receive
as
a...
had
she
lived
to
participate
in
the
retirement
benefits
are
so
much
greater,
and
fuels...
it's
really
tax
dollars.
the
tax
exemptions
and
the
tax
deferrals
fuel
the
erisa
engine
that
creates
the
wealth
that
creates
the
much
greater
benefits
at
the
end
than
she
would
expect
to
receive
just
by
investing
some
portion
of
her--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--not...
no.
she
is--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--she's
entitled,
as
a...
as
the
wife
of
the
participant
during
retirement
she
would
receive
benefits
and
would
enjoy
the
retirement
benefits.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
i
think
so,
yes,
but--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--yes.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
that
is
correct.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
no,
they
haven't.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
no,
i...
well,
i
can't
answer
that.
i
really
don't
think
so.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
but
it
really
wasn't
considered
to
be
important.
it
vested
during
the--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--they
vested
during
his
first
marriage
to--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--no.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
well,
the
result
there
is
that
if
that...
if
you
reach
that
and
you
say
that
there
is
no
preemption,
then
state
law
in
effect
redefines
who
the
beneficiaries
of
erisa
are,
because
if
you
say
that
there
is
no
preemption
of
the
community
property
law,
then
the
nonparticipant
spouse
becomes--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--but
the...
well,
you
have
to
start
with
the
premise
that
she
has
a
property
interest--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--in
the
plan.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
because
without
a
property
interest
in
the
plan--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--she
can't
have
a
property
interest--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
what
you
say
may
be
true,
but
that
would
not
be
true
had
she
not
bequeathed
her...
an
interest
to...
had
she
not
used
the
usufruct
provisions
of
louisiana
law,
because
at
the
time
she
died,
and
then
her
husband
remarried,
the...
he
would
have
lost
his
statutory
usufruct
and
therefore
those...
the
sons
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
claim
their
benefits,
or
claim
their
interest
in
their
father's...
their
mother's
estate
against
their
father's
benefits
and
therefore
he
would...
in
effect,
the
participant
would
have,
in
effect,
lost
half
of
his
benefits
in
that
instance.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
he
didn't
retire--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--well,
he
didn't
retire
until
1985,
at
which
point
the
1984
amendments
applied
and
the
selection
or
the
choice
to
take
the
joint
survivor's
annuity
was
exercised.
had
he
died--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--that
is
correct.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
at
the
time
he
retired.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
correct.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
yes,
well...
yes,
because--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--well--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--oh,
you
could...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
i'm
sorry.
he
had
rolled
it
over
into
a--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--if
it
was
in
his
bank
account
or
in
a
coffee
can
in
the--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--he
could
leave
it
to
anyone.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
yes.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
you
can
leave
it
to
your
wife.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
no.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
no.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
well,
the
problem
is
that
it's
not
hers
to
leave--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--no,
it
is
not.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
well,
when
the--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--well--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--well,
the...
erisa
preempts
the
designation,
or
sets
out
who
the
beneficiaries
are
of
the
property.
the
participant
is
the
beneficiary,
the
first
beneficiary.
his
nonparticipant
spouse
has
no...
under
erisa
has
no
rights
in
the
plan
during
the
life
of
the
participant.
our--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--well,
but
state
court
could,
under
the
qdro,
give
her
rights
in
it.
she
does
not
automatically
have
rights.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
except
that
the
results
is
that
under
that...
under
judge
fletcher's
construction
she
basically
would
have
the
surviving
participant
who
has
anticipated
receiving
these
benefits
and
has
contributed
to
them
thinking
that
he
is
going
to
retire,
he
suddenly
has
to
divide
his
benefits
with
people
who
are
not
retirees.
granted,
they...
and
they're
not
necessarily
his
children.
they
could...
it
could
be
a
charity
to
whom
she
may
have
left
this
money.
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
no,
but
it...
but
my
contention
is
that
erisa
preempts
the
application
of
that
community
property
law
from
the
moment
that
erisa
was
passed,
and
therefore
erisa
dictates
that
these
benefits
are
different.
they
are
special
property.
they
are
not
governed
by
the
state
property
laws,
whether
community
property
or
any
other
kind
of
state
property--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--congress
was
very
clear
on
the
people
who
congress
wanted
to
receive
the
benefits.
that
was
the
participant
and
the
participant
surviving
supouse.
the
purpose
is
to
assure
that
these
people
in
their
older
age
are
supported
and
are
not...
it
supplements
their
social
security
and
they
are
not
dependent
on
the
state
for
additional
support,
and
that
is
the
purpose
behind
any...
in
erisa.
and
therefore,
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
benefits
are
confined
to
the
people
who
are
the
employee
and
the
employee's
surviving
spouse...
the
qdro's
not
concerned
in
that.
only
the
people
who
are
named
in
the
statute
as
beneficiaries
are
entitled
to--
ms.
marian
m.
livaudais
--except
when
it
related
to
the
act,
did
damage
to
the
act.
the
purpose
in...
thank
you.
