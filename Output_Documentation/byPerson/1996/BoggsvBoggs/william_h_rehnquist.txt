we'll
hear

chief

but
that
was
a
statute
that
had
gone
into
effect
and
no
one
claimed
that
there
was
a
prior
thing
that
was
affected
by
the
statute.
here,
this
fellow
started
working
in
1949,
and
erisa
comes
along
in
1975.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
government
can't
simply
substitute
one
piece
of
property
for
another
piece
of
property
without
them
being
somehow
equal.
her
share
would
simply
disappear
under
your
view
in
1975,
although
it
had
existed
from
1949
on.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
was
a
government
life
insurance
policy.
that
wasn't
private
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
well,
if
there
is
a
takings
problem
in
the
case,
though,
isn't
that
a
reason
for
interpreting
erisa
so
that
it
doesn't
raise
that
problem
by
saying
that
there
isn't
the
sort
of
preemption
that
you're
arguing
for?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
livaudais.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
wolfson,
does
the
government
recognize
any
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
things
involved
here,
one
being
an
annuity
and
the
other
being
a
lump
sum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
my
understanding.
what
if
the
benefits
had
vested?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
she
had
a
right
under
louisiana
law,
i
presume,
if
it's
like
most
community...
to
prevent
any
expenditures
in
fraud
of
the
community.
there
are
all
sorts
of
ancillary
provisions
in
community
property--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--which
is
certainly
one
stick
in
a
bundle
of
rights.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
deano,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
thomas
is
asking
you
to
weigh
the
two
arguments,
which
do
you
think
is
the
better
one,
i
believe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
deano.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
