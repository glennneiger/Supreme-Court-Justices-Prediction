justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask
in
that...
does
the
record
tell
us
when
the
husband's
pension
benefits
vested?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
couldn't
find
it
myself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
would...
of
course,
it
would
be
important
if
you're
claiming
there
was
a
taking
of
vested
benefits.
you'd
have
to
know
when
they
vested
and
whether
they
vested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
surely
they
didn't
vest
in
1949,
when
he
first
started
paying
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you
through
with
your
answer?
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
three
very
brief
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one,
does
the
record
contain
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
couldn't
find
it.
and
2,
do
you
know
that
when
your...
when
the
first
wife's...
do
you
know
when
the
husband's
rights
in
the
plan
vested?
does
the
record
tell
us
the
answer
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not.
and...
but
i...
the
other...
you
have
answered
my
third
question.
i
was
going
to
ask
you
whether
the
takings
issue
had
been
raised,
and
you
did
argue
that
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
the
first
wife's
death?
which
was
'79.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i...
i
want
to
clarify
one
thing
on
the
takings
issue.
did
you
argue
that
there
was
a
taking
in
1974
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
or
when
did
you
say
the
taking
took
place?
what
was
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
argue
that
there
was
a
takings
in
'74.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
must
have
argued
that
there
had
been
a
vesting
prior
to
'74,
but
there's
no
finding
to
that
effect.
