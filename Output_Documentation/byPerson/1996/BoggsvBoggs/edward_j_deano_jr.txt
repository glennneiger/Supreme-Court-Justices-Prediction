mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
which
we're
seeking
to
uphold
is
a
simple
case.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
lump
sum
payments,
clearly
the
antialienation
provisions,
once
they've
been
paid
out
of
the
plan,
don't
apply,
and
there's
a
whole
line
of
jurisprudence
that
sets
that
out.
but
what's
i
think
very
important
conceptually
to
understand,
and
this
court
has
spoken
to
that
in
the
mackey
case
and
also
in
the
fort
halifax
case,
is
there's
a
distinct
difference
between
state
laws
that
deal
with
benefits
and
those
that
deal
with
plans,
and
that
the
preemption
clause
is
not
designed
to
preempt
state
laws
that
deal
with
benefits,
and
that
makes
sense.
if
you
preempted
the
law
that
dealt
with
benefits,
you
could
never
get
to
defined
rights,
because
those
laws
would
have
been
preempted,
so
you
couldn't
have
a
qdro.
everything
would
end
up
in
federal
court
if
you
preempted
the
laws.
so
the
remedy
to
deal
with
laws
that
are
troubling,
state
laws
that
are
troubling,
are
the
antialienation
provisions,
and
some
cases
have
said
that
you
preempt
laws
through
the
antialienation
provisions,
which
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
either,
and
i
hope
that
i'm
answering
your
question.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
well,
i--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--i
think
justice
o'connor
drew
a
point
that
i
think
is
very
salient
to
that,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
a
probate
order
should
be
defined,
or
should
be
able
to
be
qualified
as
a
qdro,
and
it's
very
interesting,
i
think,
to
take
a
look
at
the
antialienation
provision
in
1056.
the
general
antialienation
provision
in
1056
pre-rea
1984
was
held
not
to
affect
property
interests,
marital
property
interests.
then
there
was
an
additional
sentence
that
was
put
in,
and
was
held
to
that,
and
it's
a
much
narrower
antialienation
protection,
and
what
it
says
is...
and
i'm
quoting
from
section
(d)
in
paragraph...
in
(3),
that
this
alienation
shall
apply
to
the
creation,
assignment,
recognition
of
a
right,
a
benefit
which
is
payable
with
respect
to
a
participant
pursuant
to
a
domestic
relations
order.
so
one
of
two
things
happens
here.
either
the
right,
which
is...
certainly
was
designed
to
apply
to
community
property
inheritance
rights
which
were
not
contained
in
the
previous
general
antialienation...
the
right,
in
order
to
be
prohibited
through
the
antialienation
provision,
must
be
one
that
is
derived
pursuant
to
a
domestic
relations
order.
so
one
of
two
things
happens.
either
a
probate
order
is
a
domestic
relations
order,
in
which
case
that
antialienation
provision
would
apply
but
so
would
the
exception
of
a
qdro,
which
requires
two
things,
that
it
be
an
anti--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
because
this
court
has
decided
that
those
types
of
conflicts
are
treated
in
the
context
of
the
antialienation
provisions,
not
the
preemption
provisions.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
because
the
provision
that
provides
for
the
annuity
is
a
directive
to
a
plan
to
provide
for
that
annuity
in
its
plan.
it's
a
directive
to
administrators
to
draft
a
plan
that
creates
this
type
of
function,
so
if
we
began
to
say,
plans
drafted
by
administrators
can
preempt
state
law,
we
wade
into
very
dangerous
territory.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
no--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--no.
what
congress
was
looking
for
is
that
a
plan
will
have
to
operate
first
in
the
context
of
state
laws,
but
also
with
the
power
of
its
antialienation
provisions
to
operate
within
state
law,
so
that
the
antialienation
provisions
are
the
power
with
regard
to
state
laws
that
deal
with
benefits.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that
is
a
part
of
the
claim--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--that
has
been
set
out
as
part
of--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--that
is
set
out,
has
been
set
out
as
part
of
the
claim.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
oh,
no--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--it's
an
insignificant
portion
of
the
claim.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
i'd
also
like
to
just
note--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
before
i--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--excuse
me?
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
which...
that's
correct,
and
to
maybe
make
that
somewhat
more
understood,
under
louisiana
law
what
is
actually
the
claim
is
accounting
for
a
usufruct,
meaning--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--accounting
for
the
use
of
the
property.
not
necessarily
that
property
itself,
but
what
you're
calling
upon,
and
the
right
is
an
account
for
the
use
of
the
property
during
the
life
of
the
user.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
i
think--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--it's
my
understanding
that
the
total
pension
benefits,
meaning
life
insurance
policies,
meaning
lump
sums
and
this
annuity,
were
provided
over
the
life
of
the
entire
employment
of
isaac
and
during
that--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
if
isaac...
under
louisiana
law,
if
isaac--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--if
he
had
not
remarried--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--the
heirs
of
dorothy
would
have--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--and
his
heirs.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
his
heirs
would
inherit
his
property,
his
part
of
the
community
property.
any
separate
property
owe
an
accounting
to
the
heirs
of
dorothy.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
if
isaac...
oh,
had
dorothy
survived?
is
that--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
believe
under
the
plan
there
would
be
any
survivor's
annuity.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
because
that
annuity--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--that
right,
that
annuity
was
paid
for
first
of
all
with
community
funds,
and
also--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question
with
regard
to
a
fund.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
if
the
money
was
paid
from
community
funds--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--because...
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
because
she
has
a
certain
claim,
certainly
on
the
benefits
that
her
husband--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--okay.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
and
those
benefits
were
reduced
due
to
this...
due
to
this
annuity,
so
that
the
community
funds
not
only
paid
for
the
survivor's
annuity,
but
the
other
funds
that
she
would
otherwise
have
a
claim
upon,
which
were
the
funds
that
were
received
by
her
husband,
were
reduced
in
order
to
purchase
this
annuity.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
and
also,
that's
correct--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
and
the
answer
is
that
the
state
laws
dealing
with
benefits,
and
it's
been
held,
are
not
preempted
but
they
have
to
deal
with
the
antialienation
provisions
in
erisa.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
this
court
has
stated
that,
first
of
all,
the
state
laws
that
deal
with
benefits,
and
this
is
in
fort
halifax
v.
coyne,
are
not
preempted.
they
have
to...
and
that's
been
followed
in
a
line
of
jurisprudence
with
guidry
v.
sheet
metal
workers
and
other
cases,
that--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
there
is
a
conflict,
preemption
is
not
the
remedy.
preemption--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--has
not...
has
been
rendered
not
the
remedy
for
a
conflict
or
troubling
situation
with
state
laws,
state
laws
dealings
with
benefits
as
opposed
to
state
laws
dealing
with
benefit
plans.
now--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--the
remedy
is
the
antialienation
provisions
in
erisa,
and
this
court
has
reasoned
that
if
the
law,
the
state
laws
first
of
all
were
preempted
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
antialienation
provisions,
and
so
the
fact
that
the
antialienation
provisions
are
there
are
certainly
an
indication
that
the
state
laws
that
deal
with
benefits
are
not
preempted,
and
that
line
of
cases
has
been--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--the...
this...
the
speakings
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
mackey,
and
also
because
of
the
congressional...
the
screening
congressional
intent
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
rea
act
indicated
it
is
not...
it
is
not
congress'
intent
to
preempt
state
laws
dealing
with
marital
property
rights.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that
has
been--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--and
so
that
that
combination,
and
the
fact
that
if
you
begin
to
preempt
state
laws,
for
instance
you'd
never
be
able
to
get
to
an
exception
to
the
antialienation
provision,
for
instance,
a
qdro,
because
the
laws
that
would
be
the
basis
for
the
qdro
would
be
preempted.
so
that
the
remedy
is
not
preemption,
it's
dealing
with
the
antialienation
provisions.
and
to
answer
more
specifically
your
question,
the
court
reasoned
that
the
preemption
is
not
the
useless...
would
not
be
the
useless
one,
as
opposed
to
the
antialienation
definition
of
a
qdro,
because
it
was
congress'
intent
to
show
that
any
preemption
of
domestic
rights
or
domestic
laws
was
not
the
intent,
and
therefore
they
put
that
into
the--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
to
my
knowledge,
it
does
not.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
the
record...
first
of
all,
the
record
indicates
in
a
stipulation
of
facts
that
the
rights
had
vested,
and
i
also
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
issues
of
a
taking
was
raised
and
argued
in
the
district
court
level,
argued
in...
also
argued
in
the
fifth
circuit?
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
the
record
does
not.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
they
had
vested
at
the
time
of
the
wife's
death.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
to
my
knowledge,
the
only
changes
in
community
property
laws
that
have
come
about
have
been
where
the
parties
have
been
able
to
agree
to
make
those
changes.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
i
believe
the
argument
was
first
of
all
that
there
was
a
takings...
one
in
'74--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--and
there
was
one...
it
was
taken--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--right,
but
also
a
taking
in
that
the
probate
order
was
rendered
in
this
matter
in
1980,
4
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
rea
act,
and
there's
discretion
that
the...
in
section
302
that
allows
orders
that
don't
meet
the
qualifications
of
a
qdro
to
be
excepted.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
and
that
is
another
point
as
to
why
antialienation
provisions
are
not
allowed
to
preempt
state
laws,
because
they're
drafted
by
plan
administrators
that
do
have
discretion
in
the
drafting
of
those
plans.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
i
think
the
accounting
problem
is
somewhat
of
a
bogus
issue
in
that
the
administrator
just
deals
with
the
judgment
that's
presented
to
them,
and
the
rights
that
are
contained
in
the
judgment.
an
administrator
is
never
called
upon
to
do...
to
touch
a
calculator
with
regard
to
those
types
of
problems.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
well,
under
the
amendments
to
the
rea
act,
if
it's
not
a
qualified
domestic
relations
order,
it
doesn't
come
under
the
enhanced
antialienation
sanctions
that
existed
before.
i
mean,
that
existed
in
the
enactment
of
the
rea.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
it
follows
under
the
old
ones
in
which
it
was
allowed.
it
was--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
if
it
was--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--if
it
was
to
a
benefit
that
was
payable,
it
possibly
could
be
an
antialienation--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--keep
in
mind
that
the
funds
for
the
most
part
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
matter
had
left
the
plan
10
years
ago,
for
the
most
part,
and
no
administrator
will
ever
have
to
deal
with
any
of
the
things
with
regard
to
this
case.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
with
regard
to
a
transfer,
it
would
be
just
a
written
donation
that
would
be
handed
to
an
administrator.
it
would--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--right.
my...
i
believe
that
that
could
be
considered
a
non--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--an
alienation
if
it
was
to
one
that
was
payable--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--because
first
of
all
this
was
not
a
testamentary
alienation.
this
happened
under
operation
of
louisiana
law.
this
was
not--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--there
was
a
will,
but
the
children's
names
were
not
mentioned
in
the
will
at
all.
they
were
forced
heirs,
and
it
happened
as
an
operation
of
law,
so
she
didn't
make...
as
opposed
to
the
example
that
you
gave,
she
did
not
make
a
transfer,
and
that
has
been...
an
alienation
has
been
defined
as
a
will
of
transfer.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
there
was
a--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--that's
correct.
let
me
touch
just
a
little
bit
more
on
the
concept--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
the
lump
sum
was
rolled
over
into
an
ira.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
it's
my
understanding
that
he
took
the...
they
came
into
his
ownership
and
then
he
rolled
it
over
into
an
ira.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
first
they
would
have
had...
they
would
have
received
property--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--oh.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
they
would
not
at
that
moment
get
anything,
but
they--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--all
right.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
okay.
the
only
thing...
he
doesn't
get...
they
do
not
get
a
thing
from
the
plan.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
consideration
for
the
survivor's
annuity,
however,
was
the
reduced
retirement
moneys
paid
to
isaac
during
the
remainder...
upon
his
retirement,
for
which
he
purchased
this--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--except
there
was
something
there
at
this
moment,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it
would
be
like
presuming
there
wasn't
something
there
when
in
fact
there
was
something
there.
i
would
just
like
to
close
by
mentioning
again
that
the
remedy
on
state
laws
that
confuse
or
are
troubling
to
federal
concepts
with
regard
to
erisa
is
not
preemption,
that
it
comes
under
the
antialienation
provisions.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
my
argument
with
regard
to
the
lump
sum
is
the
antialienation
provisions
do
not
apply
once
they've
left
the
plan.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
yes.
the
argument--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--oh,
i
would
find
that
there
are...
there
is
equal
authority
from
this
court
for
both
of
them.
probably
the
occasion
has
risen
more
with
regard
to
the
antialienation
protections
following
after
the
benefits
leave
the
plan.
that
doctrine
may
be
more
grounded--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--there
is
nothing
to
give
away,
but
he
would
have
received
more
benefits.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
so
that
his
estate
would
have
been
larger.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
that
would
not
have
diminished
how
much
funds
he
had
used
during
this
lifetime
that--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--no,
but
it
would
have
increased
the
amount
of
funds
of
other
people
that
he
would
have
had
use
of.
he
would
have
received
more
money
from
the
plan
over
his
lifetime,
which
was
money
partially
of
other
people,
and
he
would
have
had
more
money
that
he
would
have
used
of
other--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--okay.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
well--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--the
rights
that
the
children
get
is
the
right
to
account
for
their
money
that
was
being
used--
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
--they
did
have
money.
there
was
money
that
came
in
during
his
lifetime
which
would
have
been
a
greater
amount.
mr.
edward
j.
deano,
jr.
thank
you.
