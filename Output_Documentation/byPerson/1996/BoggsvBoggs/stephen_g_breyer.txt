justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
what
is
the
lump
sum?
i
mean,
think
just
of
the
lump
sum.
smith
dies.
he
gets...
let's
say
he's
got
$200,000
in
a
lump
sum
from
his
employer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
his
will
says
the
$200,000
goes
to
a
martian,
or
it
goes
to
smith,
or
it
goes
to
jones,
goes
to
anybody.
erisa
doesn't
stop
that,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
erisa
says
i
can't
take--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--$200,000
i
got
out
of
my
pension
plan
which
i
happened
to
put
in
the
bank
and
leave
it
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
what
happened
here.
i'm
trying
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
i
just
say
this,
i
write
a
will--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
write
a
will,
and
my
will
says,
the
money
i
get
in
a
lump
sum
from
my
pension
fund,
when
i
die
i
would
like
that
will
to
go
to
john
black,
all
right.
i
can
do
that,
can't
i?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
can
i
leave
it
to
my
wife?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
if
the
state
law
says
that
this
money
has
to
go
to
john
black
or
to
my
wife,
is
there
any
problem
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
and
if
state
law
says
when
you
die
the
reason
that
it
has
to
go
to
your
wife
is
because
she
had
a
community
property
interest,
is
that
any
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
then
if
that's
no
different,
and
if
the
wife,
knowing
that
she
gets
it,
happens
to
write
a
piece
of
paper
in
advance
that
says
when
i
die,
that
money
will
go
to
my
children,
is
that
a
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no.
she
says,
if
i
get
this
money
when
my
husband
dies,
because
state
law
gave
it
to
me.
i
will
then
give
it
to
my
children.
is
that
a
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then
how
is
that
different
from
this
case
as
to
the
$200,000,
except
for
the
rollover
into
the
ira,
which
is
separate,
which
i
think
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
but
except
for
the
rollover
into
the
ira,
how
is
that
different
from
this
case
as
to
the
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
have
mixed
you
up
with
all
the
questions,
but
as
i'm
seeing
it,
all
this
is
is
a
state
law
called
a
community
property
law
that
says
what
will
happen
on
the
death
of
the
husband
to
the
money
that
was
a
fixed
sum
that
came
into
the
possession
of
the
wife
because
of
state
law
community
property,
and
she
later
on
left
it
by
will
but
she
didn't,
because
there
was
another
state
law...
or
whatever,
but
to
somebody
else.
maybe
the
sg
will
answer
that
question,
because
i...
and
if
the
answer
depends
on
the
ira,
that,
i
think,
had
to
do
with
tax
purposes.
i
don't
see
whether
you
put
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that's
what
i'm
thinking
and
i'd
like
to
get
a
response
from
that
either
from
you
or
from
the
sg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question,
but
i'm
afraid
you're
going
to
agree
with
me.
but
maybe
you
won't,
which
would
be
lucky,
and
that
is,
i'm
thinking
of
these
as
two
separate
things.
one
is
the
annuity,
and
the
second
is
everything
else,
just
plain
dollars.
now,
the
annuity,
it
seems
to
me
you
run
into
a
big
problem
of
rather
specific
provisions
that
say
how
annuities
are
supposed
to
be
set
up,
but
as
to
the
other,
you're
just
going
to
say
no.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
what
the
conflict
with
erisa
is
to
leave
the
$200,000
to
your
wife,
or
to
your
cousin,
and
if
this
all
happens
through
community
property
law,
why
is
that
any
different
than
if
it
were
the
law
of
wills,
and
even
if
community
property
governs
property
during
life,
so
what?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand...
maybe
you
could
explain
what
their
argument
against
that
is
and
what
your
reply
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
part,
the
part
that
you
want
to
answer
directly
is
the
other
part,
i
guess,
which
is
29
u.s.c.
1055
has,
like,
about
15,
or
10,
or
5
specific--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--things
that
are
supposed
to
happen
to
these
pensions,
and
that,
why
doesn't
that
preempt
community
relations...
community
property
law
insofar
as
it's
to
the
contrary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
was
thinking
of
is,
i
think
there's
a
provision
that
says
you
have
an
annuity,
and
your
employer
gives
you
an
annuity.
let's
say
it's
$2,000
a
month.
there's
going
to
have
to
be
a
provision
in
there
that
if
you
die
your
present
wife
gets
at
least
$1,000
a
month.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that
says
that
specifically
in
the
statute,
if
there's
a
community
property
law
that
says,
sorry,
your
present
wife
doesn't
get
$1,000
a
month,
rather,
that
$1,000
a
month,
which
is
all
that's
left
of
the
annuity,
goes
to
the
first
wife,
that
would
seem
like
a
direct
conflict.
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
why?
then
tell
me,
because
i
don't
know
this
area
that
well.
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
the
statute
says
that
your
pension
has
to
provide
an
annuity
of
$2,000
to
breyer
until...
as
long
as
he's
alive,
and
then
$1,000
to
his
present
wife.
the
community
property
law
says,
sorry,
the
first
wife
gets
the
$1,000.
that
sounds
like
a
direct
conflict
under
basic
principles
of
preemption
law,
and
i'd
like
to
know
why
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
there's
this
right
as
a
matter
of
state
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
husband
and
wife
1
work
together
for
30
years,
build
up
a
million
dollars
in
an
ira,
or
in
some
kind
of
a
retirement
account
with
a
pension,
and
at
the
end,
eventually
wife
1
is
long...
is
gone,
but
eventually
that
million
is
used
to
buy
an
annuity
which
says,
$2,000
a
month
to
husband,
on
husband's
death,
$1,000
a
month
to
wife
2.
you
are
saying
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
since
that
$1
million
which
paid
for
the
annuity
was
jointly
built
up
during
their
community,
wife
1
is
entitled
to
one-half
the
proceeds
of
that
eventually,
or
some
share
of
that.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
is
the
state
law
of
louisiana,
and
my
question
was,
why,
in
fact,
doesn't
this
particular
provision
that
says
half
has
to
go
to
wife
2
trump
that,
and
your
answer
was
what
it
was.
is
that
where
we
are?
