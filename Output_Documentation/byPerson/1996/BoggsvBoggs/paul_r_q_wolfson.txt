mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
interests
in
both
are
preempted,
and
we
start...
i'd
like
to
start
with
erisa's
broad...
broad
but
common
sense
preemption
clause,
the
relate-to.
in
our
view
really
the
ownership
of
plan
assets
is
the
issue
here,
and
nothing
could
relate
to
a
plan
more
than
the
basic
question
of
who
owns
the
assets
in...
who
owns
the
assets
in
the
plan,
and
that's
a...
that
is
what
the
application
of
state
community
property
law
to
an
erisa
plan--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
obviously
we
disagree
that
there's
a
taking
here,
and
i'd
like
to
address
that
first.
and
the
first
thing
is,
what
the
first
mrs.
boggs...
one
has
to
look
to
what
the
first
mrs.
boggs'
property
interest
in
the
plan
would
have
been
before
1974,
because
it's
only
pre-'74
where
the
taking
problem
might
arise,
and
what
she
really
had
was
an
inchoate
or
contingent
interest
in
the
right
to
control
benefits
that
she
would
have
received
from
the
plan
once
mr.
boggs
retired.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
we
don't
know
whether
the
benefits
had
vested,
but
even
if
the
benefits
had
vested,
justice
stevens,
i
think
in
effect
the
only
thing
that
has
been
removed
from
her
property
interest
here
is
the
right
to
make
a
testamentary
distribution
of
those
benefits.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
one
would...
i
mean,
one
would
also
have
to
consider
the
plan
to
see
that...
those
might
have
provided
her
with
some
protections
also,
but
what
she
can't
do
as
a
result
of
erisa
here
is
pass
on
her
interest
to
her
children.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
is
one,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
removal
of
that
right
amounts
to
a
taking,
because,
for
example--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
what
louisiana
could
have
passed...
i
mean,
by
hypothesis
louisiana
could
have
passed
a
law
that
said
no,
when
she
died
her
interest
had
to
go
to
her
husband.
that
was
the
terminable
interest
rule
that
has
existed
in
other
community
property
states.
it
could
have
enacted
that,
and
the
effect
of
that
would
have
been
to
say,
although
she
might
have
had
a
community
property
interest
in
her
plan
assets,
you
know,
or
have
expected
to
receive
half
of
them
when
he
retired,
and
assuming
she
was
alive
when
he
retired,
she
would
have
had
to
hand
over
everything
to
him.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
louisiana
could
have
passed
that
law,
and
i
think
that
is
really
the
effect
of
what
erisa
did
in
her
situation.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
guess
although
it
certainly--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
i
think
that...
i
mean,
obviously
in
those
cases
what
we
have
argued
is
that
in
light
of
the
court's
prior
decisions
the
government
couldn't
take
away
her
right
to
make
any
distribution
at
all
of
any
interest
she
might
have
had,
but
here,
what
it
does
is,
it...
what
erisa
did
would
be
to
transfer
her
community
interest
to
her
husband,
which
she
might
well
have
done
anyway
to
gain
the
benefit
of
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
hasn't
been
suggested
in
the
lower
courts,
and
hasn't
been
raised,
and
we
don't
know
to
what
extent--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
certainly
there
is
a
direct
conflict
with
the
provision
for
the
survivor
annuity
for
the...
that
is,
erisa
itself
says
a
surviving
spouse...
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
a
surviving
spouse
is
entitled
to
receive
a
survivor
annuity
unless
she
has
elected
to
waive
that
benefit,
assuming
there
is
a
surviving
spouse
and
unless
she
has
elected
to
waive
that
benefit
beforehand
by
a
notarized
statement,
and
so
forth.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
and
in
fact
when
the...
when
congress
enacted
the
survivor
annuity,
and
it...
it
really,
i
think
really
when
congress
enacted
the
rea
it
really
sort
of
addressed
directly
the
situation
of
spouses'
rights
and
plan
benefits
and
occupied
the
field,
if
you
will,
but
it
said
it
has
to
be
actuarially
determined
under
certain
rules
which
would
relate
to
the
annuity
that
the
participant
would
have
had
if
he'd
only
been...
if
only
he
had
been
around.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
so
it
set
up
a
federal
rule
for
determining
how
the
survivor
annuity
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
when
congress
enacted
the
domestic
relations
order
it
looked
directly
at
the
very
compelling
situation
of
the
first
spouse
who
would
have
been
expecting
to
look
to
be
supported
by
the
spouse,
or
to
share
in
those
benefits.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
think
when
congress
said
domestic
relations
law,
including
community
property
law,
it
might
have
done
that
for
two
reasons--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--if
that
spouse
has
a
domestic
relations
order
that's
been
qualified,
but
there
are
two
reasons--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no.
no.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
says
any
court
applying
domestic
relations
law,
which
is
the
law--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
but
the
reason
why
i
think
congress
did
that...
i
think
there
are
two.
first,
in
some
states
domestic
relations
law
is
in
a
separate...
you
know,
in
louisiana,
in
fact,
it's
in
a
separate
section
of
the
code
than
community
property
law.
domestic
relations
law
would
normally
be
thought
of
in
terms
of
support
as
child
support
and
alimony,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
when
you
put
them
together--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think
so,
because
when
you
put
them
together,
i
think
what
congress
was
trying
to
consider
was
the
law
that
would
be
applied
in
domestic
relations
proceedings,
specifically
legal
separation
proceedings
and
dissolution
of
a
marriage,
and
child
support
proceedings,
and
it
wanted
to
be
sure
that
the
courts
could
consider
the
community
property
law,
and
there's
a
specific...
could
have
been
a
specific
reason
for
that.
in
hisquierdo
and
some
other
cases,
the
court
had
looked
at
statutes
that
allowed
division
of
benefits
to
enforce
alimony
orders
but
not
community
property
orders.
i
believe
in
hisquierdo
the
railroad
retirement
benefit
statute
specifically
had
an
exception
to
the
antialienation
clause
for
alimony
but
not
for
community
property,
so
congress
was
removing
the
doubt
that
the
state
court,
when
it
was
enacting
a
domestic
relations
order,
could
make
an
equitable
distribution
of
the
property
by
considering
among
other
things
any
right
that
might
possibly
have
been
said
to
arise
under
state
law
by
virtue
of
the
community
property
regime
and
not
limited
to
alimony.
thank
you.
