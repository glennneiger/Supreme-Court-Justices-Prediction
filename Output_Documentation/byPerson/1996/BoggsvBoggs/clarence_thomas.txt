justice
clarence
thomas
mr.
wolfson,
before
you
go
on,
two
questions.
justice
clarence
thomas
one,
would
you
explain
for
us
what
happened
to
the
lump
sum
that
was
alienated,
or
that
was
distributed?
justice
clarence
thomas
now,
did
he
have
options
to...
was
the
money
given
to
him,
and
did
he
then
put
it
in
an
ira,
or
was
it
within
the
terms
of
the
plan?
justice
clarence
thomas
okay.
one
other
question.
let's
say
that
isaac,
that
his
wife
pre...
she
passed
away
in
1979,
that
he
was
quite
grieved,
and
did
not
remarry,
and
assume
that
the
gift
that
justice
o'connor
spoke
about
was
made
to
the
kids,
or
it
was
passed
on
as
it
was
in
this
case,
but
isaac
did
not
remarry.
what
would
the
children
get
in
those
circumstances?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
let's
just...
from
the
plan.
that's
all
i'm
interested
in.
justice
clarence
thomas
under
this
plan,
what
would
they
get?
justice
clarence
thomas
no,
when
he
died.
let's
say
everything
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
is
now.
justice
clarence
thomas
except,
he
doesn't
remarry.
justice
clarence
thomas
what
about
the
$150,000?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
the
$150,000
you
treat
separately.
let's
say
that's...
we
have
to
assume
that
went
to
a
bank
account
or
something.
is
that
accurate?
so
the
lump...
there's
a
difference
between
the
lump
sum
and
the
stock
as
opposed
to
the
survivor's
annuity.
justice
clarence
thomas
mr.
wolfson,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
do
you
have
a
better
argument
for
the
lump
sum
than
you
do
for
the
annuity?
justice
clarence
thomas
but
do
you
have
a
better
argument
for
the
lump
sum
than
the
annuity?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
i
think
where
you're
losing
me...
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt,
but
where
you're
losing
me
is,
if
he
had
not
remarried,
what
is
there
to
give
away?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
what?
justice
clarence
thomas
suppose
he
gambled.
suppose
he
decided
to
go
to
the
river
boats
and
just
feed
the
slot
machines.
justice
clarence
thomas
it
would
not
have
increased
the
estate.
justice
clarence
thomas
okay,
let's
say
he
did
not
remarry.
justice
clarence
thomas
and
he
decided
to...
for
the
few
years
he
was
single,
he
was
so
grieved,
he
was
so
full
of
grief
that
he
gambled
a
lot.
now,
what
is
it
in
the
estate
that
they
get
more
of?
i
don't
understand...
i
just
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
clarence
thomas
that
he...
there
is
no
annuity.
the
only
annuity
available
is
for
the
survivor
benefits.
there
is
no
survivor
because
he
never
rem
rried,
so
what
is
it
for
the
children
to
get?
justice
clarence
thomas
they
didn't
have
any.
