justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
scalia
is
completely
capable
of
protecting
his
own
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he's
asking
you--
--go,
tony,
i--
--he
thinks
that
he...
i
thought
that
he
was
asking
the
question
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
community
property
law,
and
then
you
tell
us
what
erisa
provides,
but
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
community
property
law,
is
justice
scalia
not
correct
that
the
wife
has
an
interest
in
the
pension
fund
which,
i
take
it,
would
have
to
be
valued
if
the
community
is
dissolved
by
divorce
and,
under...
although
i
was
surprised
to
find
this,
i
understand
the
premise
of
the
case
is
that
this
is
subject
to
bequest
under
louisiana
law.
that's
the
premise
that
we
take
the
case
on,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
there
been
cases
in
louisiana
where
the
louisiana
legislature
has
passed
laws
changing
the
rights
of
spouses
in
community
property,
saying
that
what
was
once
raw
expectancy
is
now
vested,
and
have
those...
and
if
that
has
happened,
have
any
of
those
under
state
law
been
challenged
as
takings,
or
retroactive--
