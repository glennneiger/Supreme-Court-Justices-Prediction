but
she
would
if
she
divorced
him,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
judge
fletcher
said
one
of
the
many
anomalies
in
this
case
is,
you
take
a
woman
who
under
state
law
is
a
coowner,
and
she
stays
a
coowner.
if
before
she
dies,
predeceasing
her
husband,
she
divorces
him,
then
her
coownership
can
be
realized
and
she
can
pass
it
on
to
her
children.
but
if
she
should
stay
with
him
till
her
last
breath,
then
her
coownership
vanishes,
and
i
suppose
judge
fletcher
was
saying,
if
there
is
another
construction
that's
reasonable,
we
ought
to
apply
that,
rather
than
one
that
leads
to
this
very
odd
result.
justice
ruth
bader

mrs.
livaudais,
do
i
understand
this
to
be
the
practical
consequence
of
your
position:
for
more
and
more
older
people,
the
pension,
if
it's
not
the
principal
asset,
but
certainly
a
principal
asset,
and
so
to
the
extent
of
that
pension,
the
federal
government
has
done
away
essentially
with
the
community
regime,
and
is
there
anything
specific
in
the
statute,
or...
that
suggests
that
congress
really
was
trying
to
undo,
destroy
the
community?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
longer
a
claim.
you
prevailed
on
it,
in
fact,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
fifth
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--didn't
you
succeed
on
the
claim,
and
the
claim
included
not
only
the
lump
sum
amounts,
a
piece
of
those,
but
also
a
piece
of
the
survivor's
annuity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
the
three
sons,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
result
of
it
would
be
that
the
current
wife,
who's
getting
something
like
$1,800
a
month,
or
something
like
that,
that
she
would
in
fact
have
to
pay
over
a
piece
of
that,
whatever
is
the...
it
could
be
reduced
to
a
lump
sum,
but
a
piece
of
her
monthly
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
it--
--the
fifth
circuit
interpreted
the
statute
in
such
a
way
that
there
was
no
takings
problem.
it
held
for
you
down
the
line.
but
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
raised
on
the
other
side
about
the
federal
interest
is,
sparing
the
plan
from
being
burdened
with
all
these
peculiarities
of
usufruct
and
forced
heirship
and
all
that,
and
we're
also
been
told
by
one
of
the
briefs
that
there
are
peripatetic
workers
who
walk
in
and
out
of
community
property
states,
and
the
whole
thing
would
be
a
nightmare
for
administration,
so
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
