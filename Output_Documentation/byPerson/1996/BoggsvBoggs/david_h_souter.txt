h.

well,
is
it
the
case,
then,
if
there
had
been
no
erisa
at
all,
would
the
first
wife
have
had
something
to
bequeath
by
will?
do
you
agree
that
she
would
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
premise
is
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
find
that
troubling,
but
what
i'm
not
clear
on
is
whether
i
have
to
reach
that
particular
trouble.
has
anyone
raised
the
issue
of
a
taking
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
she
didn't
do
it,
and
the
state
didn't
pass
the
law,
and
is
it
fair
to
say
this,
that
if
we
assume
that
in
fact
there
has
been
a
taking
to
the
extent
suggested--
justice
david
h.
souter
--your
argument
still...
pardon
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
it's
being
raised
here
i
think
in
aid
of
the
question
how
should
we
construe
or
how
should
we
apply
as
vague
a
preemption
provision
as
relates-to,
and
i
thought
from
your
brief
that
you
in
effect
would
address
that
question
by
saying,
you
really
don't
have
a
real
issue
of
how
to
construe
the
vagueness
of
relates-to.
because
even
if
there
weren't
a
preemption
clause
in
this
statute,
you've
got
good
old
garden
variety
conflict
preemption
here
as
between
what
erisa
provides
for
surviving
spouses
and
what
community
property
law,
at
least
as
we
are
suggesting
it,
could
be
construed
would
otherwise
provide,
and
you've
got
to
face
the
fact,
i
think
you
would
say,
that
there
is
that
conflict
preemption.
am
i
being
fair
to
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
say
that
cannot
be
construed
to
be
a
survivor's
annuity
based
upon
whatever
may
be
left
under
state
law.
you're
saying
that
has
got
to
be
determined
in
relation
to
either
the
contributions
or
the
defined
benefit
of
the
plan,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
explain
that
to
me
further,
because
that's
the
point...
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
that.
i
don't
understand
your
argument
about
the
significance
of
the
antialienation
provision
if
we
assume
a
conflict
which
would
otherwise
give
rise
to
a
preemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
there's
no
conflict
preemption
under--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't
there...
now,
i'm
sorry,
this
is
probably
a
very
stupid
question,
but
why
isn't
the
antialienation
provision
explicable
in
terms
of
rights
under
the
erisa
plan
as
distinct
from
rights
under
state
law?
