justice
antonin
scalia
what
she
would
get
by
outliving
her
husband
isn't
what
troubles
me.
it
seems
to
me
that's
like
having
an
ownership
in
a
lottery
ticket,
and
by
the
time
the
event
occurs
that
brings
erisa
into
it
the
lottery
has
been
run
and
the
ticket
is
a
loser.
it's
worthless
at
that
point.
so
also,
it's
worthless
here
once
she
dies.
so
it's
not
her
survivor
benefits
that
concern
me,
but
isn't
she
entitled...
isn't
she
entitled
to
the...
half
of
all
the
benefits
that
the
husband
receives?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
community
property
state,
isn't
his
entitlement
to
the
retirement
benefits
really
an
entitlement
that's
half
hers,
and
that
does
continue,
whether
she
dies
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
livaudais,
could
i
ask
you,
regarding
justice
breyer's
question,
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
only
effect
of
a
community
property
law
is
to
say
how
the
husband's
property
goes
when
he
dies,
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
hypothesis
of
justice
breyer's
question?
doesn't
the
community
property
law
make
it
her
property
immediately,
before
the
husband
dies,
so
it
isn't
a
question
of
the
husband
getting
all
the
money
at
the
end
and
state
law
just
saying
where
the
husband's
property
goes.
your
contention
is
that
it
is...
or
the
community
property
law
says
that
it
is
her
property.
half
of
it
is
hers
at
the
outset.
she
doesn't
get
half
at
his
death.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
congress
doesn't
care
what
the
result
is.
it
just
wants...
it
just
insists
that
the
administrators
draw
up
a
certain
scheme
and
it's
okay
if
the
states
adopt
their
laws
in
such
a
way
that
the
scheme
doesn't
produce
any
particular
result.
all
congress
wants
is
the
abstract
ideal
of
an
administrative
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
$1,000
annuity
that
justice
breyer
was
asking
you
about,
is
that
at
issue
here?
i
thought
that
was
not
at
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
she's
not
claiming
that
she
gets
the
later
wife's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--annuity,
is
she?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
thought
that
the
brief
said
that
that
was
not
the
issue
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not,
and--
--no.
but
that's
the
puzzlement
about
this
case.
that's
been
the
puzzle.
how
can
the
first
wife
claim
the
annuity
that
wouldn't
have
existed
if
the
first
wife
hadn't
died?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
had
he
not
remarried
there
would
have
been
no
annuity.
at
the
time
she
died,
that
was
it.
the
right
to
an
annuity
comes
about
later
because
he
remarries,
and
now
the
first
wife,
who
at
the
time
of
her
death
had
no
claim,
gets
a
right
to
the
second
wife's
annuity.
it
seems
very
strange
to
me.
i
can't
imagine--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
couldn't
i
think
that
what
was
bought
with
the
community
funds
was,
as
i
described
it
earlier,
a
lottery
ticket?
the
wife
has
a
chance.
if
she
outlives
the
husband,
she
has
a
right
to
this
annuity,
but
at
the
time
of
her
death,
the
lottery
was
over.
she
had
lost.
there's
nothing
left
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
other
part
of
the
case.
i
acknowledge
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
part,
the
husband's--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
remedy,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
had
vested
when?
when?
justice
stevens
asked
you
when?
yes.
does
the
record
tell
us
when
the
husband's
rights
vested?
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
you
say
they
had
vested,
had
vested
when,
by
when?
by
today?
by
the
time
of
the
husband's
death?
by
the
time
of
the
wife's
death?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
the
deal.
that's
just
like
the
husband
and
wife
agreeing
to
sell
a
piece
of...
sell
an
automobile
for
a
boat.
i
mean,
you
don't
value
what
the
wife
gets
on
the
basis
of
the
boat.
if
they
went
into
the
deal
and
traded
the
one
for
the
other,
it's
gone,
and
what
you
have
is
what's
in
front
of
you,
so
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
say,
well,
they
got
this
money
only
because
they
took
less
of
something
else...
that
was
what
they
bought.
