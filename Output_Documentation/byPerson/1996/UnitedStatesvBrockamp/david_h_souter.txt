--wasn't
the--
--no,
but
there's
another
distinction
that
you
can
make.
you
can
take
the
position
that
justice
scalia
did
and
say,
let's
bring
everything
under
the
umbrella
of
equitable
adjustment.
and
then
there
are
still
distinctions
between
the
cases,
and
the
one
is,
title
vii
case
was
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
the
government
is
often
in
the
position
of
a
private
individual
who
normally
gets
the
benefit
of
equitable
tolling,
whereas
in
the
revenue
situation,
the
government
is
in
a
position
peculiar
unto
itself,
so
those
would
be
good
reasons
to
say
that
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the...
that
there
would
be
a
spillover
of
equitable
considerations
from
a
title
vii
case
to
a
revenue
case,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
make
more
sense
of
the
fact
that
these
two
cases
came
down
in
the
same
term,
in
which
it
would
be
very
odd
to
think
that
one
was
being
undercut
by
the
other
so
soon.

the
different
principles
being
equitable
tolling
versus
equitable--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice

but
if
we
don't
accept
that
distinction,
doesn't
the
remaining
distinction...
in
other
words,
if
we
generalize
equity,
then
aren't
you
faced
with
the
fact
that
the
title
vii
considerations
would
not
normally
be
applicable
to
a
revenue
case?
