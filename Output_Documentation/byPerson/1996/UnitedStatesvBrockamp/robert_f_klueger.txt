mr.
robert
f.
klueger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
where
a
disabled
taxpayer
erroneously
overpays
his
taxes
and
later,
through
some
miracle,
determines
that
he
has
overpaid
and
then
seeks
his
redress,
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
congress
intended
that
that
disabled
taxpayer
should
have
no
redress,
even
in
a
case
such
as
this,
the
brockamp
case,
where
the
erroneous
overpayment
was
a
direct
result
of
the
taxpayer's
disability.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
he
has
no
redress
because
he
was
disabled
throughout
the
statutory
period.
that
is
the
facts
of
this
case.
he
would
certainly
have
the
direct...
a
redress
if
he
were
like
the
rest
of
us,
a
competent
taxpayer.
but
throughout
the
statutory
period
in
6511,
he
was
disabled.
only
through
some
miracle
his
daughter
discovered
the
overpayment
following
the
taxpayer's
death,
and
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
in
this
circumstance
not
only
is
there
an
unfairness,
but
that
i
think
the
unfairness
is
perhaps
beside
the
point.
the
point--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--i
am
not
ask...
specifically,
your
honor,
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
be
tugged
by
the
equities.
i
am
specifically
saying,
the
point
being
that
congress
did
not
intend,
could
not
intend
that
this
be
the
result.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
yes,
that
is
true.
i
believe
that
congress'
intent
is
revealed,
albeit
darkly,
in
section
6511
itself,
in
the
structure
of
section
6511.
it
is
best,
i
think,
to
turn
to
the
operation
of
this
statute.
this
is
a
statute
of
limitations
which
is
not
unique
but
rare,
in
that
the
clock
that
starts
the
statute
of
limitations
may
only
begin
to
run
but
for
some
predicate
act
that
is
performed
by
the
taxpayer,
whether
it
is
the
filing
of
the
return
or,
in
the
case
of
mr.
mcgill,
cutting
a
check.
until
one
of
those
acts
eventuates,
the
clock
never
starts
to
run.
now,
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
that
much
of
an
intellectual
stretch
to
assume
that
if
this
is
a
statute
of
limitations
that
can
only
begin
to
run
but
for
the
taxpayer's
act,
that
the
taxpayer's
act
not
be
the
result
of
his
fantasies
or
his
delusions,
but
be
the
act
of
a
rational,
competent
taxpayer,
and
if
i
might,
to
illustrate
this
point,
a...
because
the
counsel
for
the
government
has
discussed
the
possibility
of
holding
hundreds
of
millions
of
tax
returns
open
perhaps
indefinitely
if
equitable
tolling
applies.
this
section
6511(a),
i
submit,
contemplates
that.
if
we
have
someone
who
does
not
perform
any
of
these
two
predicate
acts,
let
us
assume
he
didn't
in
1962,
and
let
30
years
go
by
without
paying
his
tax
and
without
filing
his
return,
and
then
one
day
he
walks
in
and
files
his
return
and
pays
the
tax,
and
then
a
year
later
figures
that
he
overpaid
and
files
a
refund
claim,
that
is
a
perfectly
timely
refund
claim
under
anyone's
interpretation
of
6511.
even
though
the
government
will
have
had
to
wait
31
years
for
the
return
and
the
check,
even
though
the
litigation
to
follow,
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
underlay
the
tax,
occurred
31
years
ago,
that
is
the
way
section
6511
operates.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
my
client--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--well,
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
question
that
i
was
addressing
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
is
what
is
there
in
this
statute
that
leads
me
to
believe
that
equitable
tolling,
that
this
is
the
type
of
statute
in
which
equitable
tolling
might
apply,
and
my
answer
is
that
the
way
that
6511
operates,
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
what
6511
(a)
is,
it
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
it
can
only
begin
to
run
after
the
taxpayer
acts.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
in
our
specific
case,
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
underlying
tax
never
began
to
run
against
stanley
mcgill
throughout
his
entire
life.
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
the
statute
of
limitations
on
refund
claims
per
6511
ran
out,
even
though
the
underlying
period
of
limitations
against
the
commissioner
to
assess
a
tax
never
began.
we
submit
that--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--the
government--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--if
the
government
had
been--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--yes.
yes--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--if
the
government
was
consistent
in
that
position,
the
government
would
have
assessed
the
tax.
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
position
the
government
takes.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
that's
correct.
they
in
fact
did
not
assess...
i
don't
think
that
fact
is
necessarily
relevant
to
the
question--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
this
is
a...
your
honor,
if
i
might
answer
that
question
at
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
length,
this
is
an
extremely
dense,
dark
statute.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
your
honor,
this
is
a
dense,
integrated
regime
of
refund
claims,
that
is
true.
i
feel,
however,
it
is
no
less
dense
and
integrated
than
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
which
was
the
grounds
for
applying
equitable
tolling
in
the
irwin
decision.
in
the
irwin
decision,
we
had
a
procedure
for
recouping...
procedure
for
suing
on
a
title
vii
case
that
is
really
very
similar
to
what
we
have
where...
in
the
statutory
regime
for
refund
claims.
we
had
a
situation
where
an
individual
goes
to
his
particular
agency
under
the
civil
rights
act.
if
that
claim
is
denied,
he
goes
to
the
eeoc,
at
which
point
there
is
a
30-day
letter
that
is
sent
to
the
individual.
if
that
is
denied,
he
has
the
opportunity
to
sue
in
federal
court,
a
very
similar
statutory
regime.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
no--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--the
direct
answer,
your
honor,
the
way
we
read
(b)(2)
is
that
it
is
not
a
substantive
limitation.
to
the
extent
that
amounts
are
limited
in
(b)(2),
it
is
as
a
function
of
the
limitation
in
time.
there
are
plenty
of
substantive
limitations
that
exist
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
isn't
one
of
them.
for
example,
the
internal
revenue
code
says...
provides
a
limitation
on
the
credit
you
can
get
against
the
state
taxes.
the
code
says,
it's
limited,
$192,800.
that
is
a
substantive
limitation
that
is
contained
in
the
tax
court...
in
the
tax
code,
and
no
court
can
change
it
to
$193,000.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
to
the
extent
that
it
affects
the
limitation,
it
is
a
limitation
that
is
a
function
of
time,
and
that
time
in
(b)(2)
refers
back
to
the
time
limitations
in
6511(a).
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
we
are
not
in
(b)(2)(a).
there
was
no
return
filed.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
the
claim
was
filed...
i
can
give
you
the
exact
date,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
the
claim
was
filed
in
1991.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
oh,
of
course
not.
of
course
not.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
well--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--but
the--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--i
don't
wish
to
ignore
it.
i
suggest
that
it
is
amenable
to
equitable
tolling.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
oh,
absolutely.
in
the
same
way,
we--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--well,
i
believe
that
dalm
is
distinguishable
in
that
the
issue
of
a
taxpayer's
disability
did
not
arise,
number
1,
and
dalm
limited
the
application
of
an
equitable
principle.
it
didn't
eliminate
the
amenability
of
the
tax
code
to
an
equitable
principle.
it
limited
it.
quite
frankly,
in
the
dalm
case
the
litigant
had
the
ability
to
litigate
the
second
tax
in
the
tax
court
and
slept
on
her
rights.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
i
don't
believe
so.
i...
as
i--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--in
the
dalm
case
i
don't
recall
that
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
no,
your
honor.
the
dalm
case
was
decided
not
on
equitable
tolling
but
on
equitable
recoupment,
a
different
doctrine.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
equitable
tolling
did
not
come
into
that
case
at
all.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
well--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--your
honor,
after
the
dalm
decision,
as
i
read
it,
i
read
that
the
dalm
decision
limited
this
court's
prior
decision
in
bull
but
did
not
overrule
it.
as
i
read
the
dalm
decision,
we
still
have
a
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment,
and
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment
does
allow
the
taxpayer
to
go
and
have
a
setoff
against
taxes
where
the
period
of
limitations
against
that
tax
did
run
out.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
i'm
not
so
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
we
are
certainly
not
saying,
your
honor,
that
a
disabled
taxpayer
is
exempt
from
the
statutory
provisions
that
are
contained
in
6511.
we
only
say
that
those
statutory
provisions
be
deferred
until
such
time
as
the
taxpayer,
by
whatever
means,
regains
his
competency.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
i...
the
claim
was...
he
died
in
1989,
and
i
believe
it
was
filed
in
1991.
it
was...
the
claim
was
timely
filed.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
your
honor,
i
apologize--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
that
is
absolutely
true.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
his...
i
am
confident
that
his
competent
heirs
did
file
a
timely
claim.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
my
memory
fails
me
as
to
the
exact
date,
your
honor,
but
i
do
recall,
and
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
that
was
the
case.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
no.
we
believe
that,
consistent
with
a
self-assessment
type
of
tax
regime,
that
the
disability
with
respect
to
tolling
should
be
that
disability
on
the
part
of
the
taxpayer
that
inhibits
the
taxpayer
from
filing
a
return.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
in
fairness
to
the
government,
i
think
that
equitable
tolling,
the
grounds
on
which
the
court
should
apply
equitable
tolling,
the
disabilities
that
should
qualify
is
a
narrow
one,
because
the
government
does
have
a
legitimate
need
to--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--your
honor,
if
it's
an
alcoholic,
if
it
is
someone
who's
senile,
it
should
be,
the
standard
should
be,
what
was...
was
there
a
disability
throughout
the
statutory
period
that
inhibited
the
taxpayer
from
having--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
mr.
wallace
has
raised
the
specter,
and
they
certainly
do
on
their
brief,
of
hundreds
of
thousands,
perhaps
millions
of
tax
returns
that
might
remain
open
if
this
doctrine
were
permitted
in
this
area.
we
think
that's
an
exaggeration,
to
say
the
least,
for
this
reason.
we
feel
that
since
1990,
when
this
court
decided
the
irwin
case,
that
in
fact
the
floodgates
were
opened,
that--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
i
don't
think
that
dalm
and
irwin
are
inconsistent
with
each
other.
i
think
they
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other.
they
deal
with
different
doctrines.
the
irwin
decision
dealt
with
equitable
tolling.
the
dalm
decision
dealt
with
equitable
recoupment,
and
did
not--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--well,
i
don't
think
that
one
undercut
another.
the
irwin
decision
did
not
mention
the
dalm
case,
nor
do
i
expect
that
it
would,
but
any
irwin
decision,
from
what
i
have
read,
the
briefs
in
that
case
and
the
argument
in
that
case
did
not
mention
dalm.
i
have
to
presume
that--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--no,
the--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--correct.
i
think
the...
i
assume
that
the
reason
the
irwin
decision
does
not
mention
dalm
or
that
the
briefs
in
that
decision
don't
mention
dalm,
or
that
it...
that
dalm
was
not
argued
in
irwin,
was
that
the
two
cases
just
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other.
they're
on
different
principles.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
equitable
recoupment.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
exactly.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
correct.
your
honor,
if
this
court
decides
that
dalm
applies
in
equitable
tolling
to
the
same
extent
it
applies
to
equitable
recoupment,
i
have
a
problem.
that
certainly
is
true.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
i
don't...
i
will
admit,
your
honor,
i
did
not
read
the
dalm
decision.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
indeed
i
did,
your
honor,
and
i
noted
that
the
dissenter
in
that
case
indicated
that
this
was
a
case
that
would
have
very
narrow
applicability.
i'm
surprised
that...
i
was
surprised
that
the
government
would
seek
to
pump
up
dalm
into
something
that--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--no,
of
course
not.
of
course
not.
my
point
is
that
dalm
should
not
apply,
because
it
applies
to
a
different
doctrine.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
oh,
absolutely
not,
no.
in
the
brief
time
remaining--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--of
course.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
that
is
correct.
the
government
has
an
inference
from
the
existence
of
the
mitigation
provisions
that
these
provisions
should
be
exclusive,
the
only...
that
the
mitigation
provisions,
which
are
statutory,
are
the
only--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question.
the
mitigation
provisions
are...
is
a
statutory
provision.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
it
was
from
my
reading
enacted
because
equitable
recoupment,
the
cases
were
going
all
over
the
place,
and
so
congress
felt
that
they
should
bring
some
order
to
this
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment,
and
so
they
enacted
the
mitigation
provisions.
they
are
very,
very
narrow
provisions.
they
arise
in
only
the
rarest
circumstances.
but
i
think
the
existence
of
the
mitigation
provisions,
the
statutory
mitigation
provisions,
proves
one
point,
which
is
that
if
you
have
a
statutory
mitigation
provision
in
the
tax
code
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you
cannot
have
an
equitable
overlay,
because
we
still
do
have
an
equitable
overlay,
and
that
equitable
overlay
is
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment,
which
exists
side
by
side
with
the
mitigation
provisions
of
the
tax
code.
those
provisions--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--no,
your
honor.
equitable
recoupment
applies
in
a
very,
very
narrow
area.
it
certainly
is
not
limited
to
incompetent
taxpayers.
you
don't
have
your
choice.
it's
not
like
a
cafeteria.
you
don't
get
equitable
recoupment
or
equitable
tolling.
equitable
recoupment
only
can
arise
when
two...
when
the
taxpayer
is
called
upon
to
pay
two...
to
pay
the
same
tax
twice
under
different
theories.
that's
equitable
recoupment.
equitable
tolling
is
a
completely
different
doctrine.
it
reminds
me
of
what
mark
twain
said
about
fires
and
fire
flies.
they
may
sound
alike,
but
just
because
they
sound
alike--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--again,
your
honor,
two
different
doctrines
here.
we
are
responsible--
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
yes,
your
honor,
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
yes,
your
honor.
the
equities
i
submit
are
stronger
in
this
case
than
they
were,
for
example,
in
dalm.
in
dalm,
the...
may
i
complete?
mr.
robert
f.
klueger
in
dalm,
the
taxpayer
had
the
ability
to
litigate
the
case.
in
our
case,
we
never
had
the
ability.
thank
you,
your
honor.
