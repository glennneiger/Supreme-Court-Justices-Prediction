justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
recommend...
assuming
the
facts
are
as
the
petitioner
states,
or
as
the
respondent
states
them
in
brockamp,
the
case
of
the
elderly
man,
would
you
recommend
that
a
private
bill
be
passed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
justice
department?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i've
noticed
you've
had
two
of
these
bills
in
34
years--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
apparently
you're
pretty
tough
on
these.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
just
wonder
what--
--well,
surely
the
justice
department
would
recommend
a
private
bill
in
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
you
speak
for
the
department?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
assume
everything's
correct--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
a
claim
filed
under
this
statute
when
the
taxpayer
just
gives
the
notice
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
or
is
a
claim
filed
when
there's
a
refund
suit
filed?
i
think
it's
the
former,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
file
a
claim
for
refund?
