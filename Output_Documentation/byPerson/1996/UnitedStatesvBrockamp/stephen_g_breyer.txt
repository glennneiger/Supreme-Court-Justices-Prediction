justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
what
might
be
an
irrelevant
question
on
that
point,
but
would
help
with
my
understanding
of
the
statute?
apparently,
in
their
brief
on
page
18
it
did
say
as
first
enacted
it
said
it's
within
3
years
from
the
time
the
return
was
required
to
be
filed,
and
when
you
read
the
statute...
the
same
thing
came
up
i
think
last
year,
you
know,
in
a
different
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i've
never
been
able
to
understand
the
statute
for
that
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
left
those
words,
was
required,
out,
and
then
it
seems
as
if
you
could
file
a
return
like,
82
years
later,
and
82
years
later,
now,
it's
not
too
late,
and
they
start
the
statute
running,
but
the
grab-back
only
goes
back
2
or
3
years.
now,
what
was--
--why
don't
you
get
these
things
amended
for
us,
mr.
wallace,
so
they
can
make
some
sense?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
it
just
an
accident
they
left
out
the
words,
were
required,
or
was
required,
or
is
some
purpose
going
on
that
i
can't
understand?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why?
why?
that
is...
if
i
can
get...
i
mean,
i'll
help
you,
i
think.
maybe
i
won't.
you
might
not
need
my
help.
but
the
language
and
complexity
doesn't
bother
me.
it
says,
the
claim
for
refund
shall
be
filed
2
years
from
the
time
the
tax
was
paid.
two
years,
you
say,
means
2
years
minus
time
when
he's
disabled.
that's
what
you're
saying,
right?
two
years
not
counting
time
when
he
was
disabled.
isn't
that
your
argument?
if
you
don't
want
to
take
that
argument,
you
don't
have
to,
but
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
thought
the
tolling
principle,
you
have
a
statute
of
limitation
that
says
file
within
3
years.
tolling
means
file
within
3
years
not
counting
disability
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
you
want
to
read
those
words
in
(a)
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
want
to
read
the
words
2
years
in
(b)
shall
not
exceed
the
portion
of
the
tax
paid
during
the
2
years
immediately
preceding
to
read,
2
years
not
counting
disability
time.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
you
started
out
saying
the
language
is
okay,
and
you
started
out
saying
the
complexity
doesn't
matter.
it
just
happens
that
congress
said
the
same
thing
twice
and
not
once,
so
i'm
with
you
so
far.
you
said
the
government
wants
us
to
read
that
language
not
to
have
tolling.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
right,
but
their
reason
is
that
they
think
it
would
create
a
total
nightmare,
and
therefore
congress
couldn't
have
intended
this
and,
indeed,
it's
the
internal
revenue
code,
not
noted
for
its
charity
perhaps,
but
not...
and
you
know,
it's
the
government.
it's
not
two
private
people,
and
they
don't
have
these
green
eyeshades
when
they
try
to
investigate
whether
a
person
was
drunk
or
not
drunk,
or
disabled
or
not
disabled,
so
it
couldn't
be
that
congress
intended
that.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
address
that
argument
when
you
started,
and
therefore
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
chance
to
address
it.
