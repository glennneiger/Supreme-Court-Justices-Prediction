justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
has
redress
for
3
years.
i
mean,
there's
just
a
time
limit
on
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
have
a
substantive
limitation,
as
this
does,
and
how
do
you
handle
the
substantive
limitation
here?
it's
not
a
matter
of
just
getting
around
it
or
ignoring
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
rewrite
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
how
your
case
comes
in
under
(b)(2).
how
do
you
qualify
under
(b)(2)?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine,
but
how
do
you
apply
(b)(2)?
if
it
was
filed
by
the
taxpayer
during
the
3-year
period
prescribed
in
subsection
(a),
and
it
wasn't,
right,
so
you're
not
in
(b)(2)(a),
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
you
must
be
in
(b)(2)(b),
limit
where
claim
not
filed
within
3-year
period.
if
the
claim
was
not
filed
within
such
3-year
period,
the
amount
of
the
credit
shall
not
exceed
the
portion
of
the
tax
paid
during
the
2
years
immediately
preceding
the
filing
of
the
claim.
now,
when
was
your
claim
filed?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
was
your
claim
filed?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
were
no
taxes
paid
during
the
2
years
immediately
preceding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
i
don't
understand
what
you
do
with
(b),
then.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--(b)(2)(b)
says
you
get
no
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
you
say
you
ignore
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr.
klueger,
that
was
in
any
event
not
the
basis
on
which
we
decided
the
case.
we
didn't
decide
there
is
no
equity
here.
we
decided
there
is
no
equitable
tolling
here,
equity
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
equitable
alteration
of
the
terms
of
the
code.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
that
there
was
no
equity
in
the
case.
i
mean,
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
what
if
he
died.
in
this
case
didn't
he
die
without
regaining
the
competency?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
much...
how
many
years...
how
long
after
his
death
was
the
claim
filed?
justice
antonin
scalia
within
2
years
from
his
death?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
crucial,
because
you
could
not
answer
justice
breyer's
question
yes,
as
you
did,
making
a
reading...
reading
(b)(2)(b)
to
say
2
years,
you
know,
not
including
disability
time.
you'd
have
to
say
not
including
disability
time
and
also
not
including
any
time
after
death.
you'd
have
to
say,
right,
at
least
his
heirs
have
to
do
it
within
2
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
said
he
did
it
within
2
years
here.
i
thought
you
said
you
didn't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
within
2
years
after
his
death?
well,
by
what
standard
do
you
conclude
it
was
timely?
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
you.
