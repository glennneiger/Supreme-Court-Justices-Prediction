--but
the
government
is
looking
into
the
possibility
of
statutory
amendment.
the
question
is,
the
tolls--
--well,
didn't...
wasn't
there
a
provision
offered
for
amending
this
very
section?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
still
being
prepared,
though?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
money
that
was
paid
was
payment
of
the
tax.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
the
position
the
government
takes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
payment
was
made.
justice
sandra

the
taxpayer.
