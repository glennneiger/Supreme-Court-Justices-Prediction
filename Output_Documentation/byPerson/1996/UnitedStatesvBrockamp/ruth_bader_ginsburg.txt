mr.
wallace--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask,
if
this
was
not
a
problem
that
was
noticed
by
the
administration,
at
least
there
was
a
press
release
at
the
very
time
that
your
cert
petition
was
filed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
which
i
believe
the
president
announced
that
the
law
must
be
followed,
but
this
is
a
very
hard
situation
for
people
to
be
in,
that
they
overpaid
and
they
can't
get
it
back,
so
wasn't
it
proposed
that
there
be
a
study
of
what
legislative
solution
there
might
be
to
help
people
out
in
this
bind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
before
you
do
if
you
can
just
clarify
for
me
what
would
be
within
the
universe
of
possible
responses
beside
a
private
bill?
i
suppose
what
the
administration
was
looking
for
was
not
a
private
bill,
but
something
maybe
akin
to
the
mitigation
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
the
equity
is
concerned,
do
you
need
to
go...
say
anything
more
than
the
court
did
in
its
decision
in
the
dalm
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
we
be
tugged
by
the
equities
here,
and
undoubtedly
these
are
hard
cases,
tugged
more
by
these
equities
than
the
court
was
in
the
dalm
case,
which
was
also
a
very
sympathetic
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
didn't
they
put
the
check
in
an
overpayment
fund?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
still
have
a
statute
that
says
no
matter
what
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no
matter
what
it
was,
the
payment
was,
the
statute
addresses
refund,
and
what
you
want
is
a
refund,
so
whatever
the
character
of
the
payment
was,
the
treasury
has
it,
and
you
want
it
back,
and
so
you
are
suing
for
a
refund.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
is
a
rather
dense
statute,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
part
of
a
dense
code
that
does
have...
does
have
some
provisions
for
equitable
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
those
provisions
themselves
are
remarkably
dense,
so
why
would
one,
given
the
density
of
the
code,
given
the
density
of
the
mitigation
provisions,
say,
but
the
court,
because
in
other
areas
there's
equitable
tolling,
ought
to
apply
it
here
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
there
some...
some
not
entirely
honorable
conduct
on
the
government
side
in
that
case
in
tripping
or
trapping
her?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
some
line
in
an
opinion
about
how
badly
the
government
had
behaved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
so
narrow
that
it
wouldn't
include
at
least
alcoholics
and
people
who
are
senile,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you'd
have
a
trial
in
each
case
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
we
see
in
the
case
of
an
alcoholic,
some
of
them
can
carry
on
a
business
and
function
all
right,
others
can't
function
so
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
somebody
who's
betwixt
and
between,
say
in
the
first
stages
of
a
debilitating
disease,
there'll
be
a
great
variety
of...
much
room
for
trials,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did--
--yes,
but
the
numbers--
--get
down
so
quickly?
i
mean,
they
were
very
close
in
time,
weren't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
dalm
case
and
the
irwin
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--were
within
a
year
of
each
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
you
think
that
there
was
such
rethinking
a
light
dawned
in
irwin
that
led
to
a...
to
the
court
in
dalm
having
seen
the
error
of
its
ways,
so
if
it...
that
case
had
come
up
and
the
opportunity
for
equitable
tolling
had
presented
itself,
they
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
what
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
irwin
after,
few
months
after,
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
think
that
the...
in
the
mitigation
rules
there
is
some
element
of
the
government
having
taken
an
inconsistent
position
and
it
seems
to
be
that
you
have
to
have
that
much.
am
i
not
right
that
the
way
the
government
describes
it
in
its
brief
the
mitigation
provisions
apply
to
problems
that
exist
when
the
party
that
asserts
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
only
one
who
would
assert
it
would
be
the
government,
had
prior
to
the
running
of
the
statute
taken
a
position
inconsistent
with
its
current
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
maybe
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
government...
that
congress
was
so
strict
in
allowing
any
mitigation
at
all,
when
the...
so
the
notion
that
they
meant
it
when
they
didn't
say
it
is
a
little
hard
to
accept.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if...
wouldn't
it
totally
eclipse
what's
in
the
code
if
you
could
just
say,
i
don't
want
to
deal
with
that
dense
stuff,
it's
so
narrow
and
so
technical.
give
me
equitable
tolling
writ
large.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
we
be
more
responsive
to
getting
back
a
tax
paid
once
than
a
tax
paid
twice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
making
equity
your
plea,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
i'm
thinking
of
different
situations
where
one
might
be
drawn
by
the
equities
of
the
situation,
because
even
in
administering
a
system
of
equity
you
have
to
have
a
rational
basis.
