mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
these
companion
cases
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
equitable
tolling
may
be
applied
to
enlarge
or
suspend
the
statutory
periods
that
limit
the
time
for
filings
and
the
amount
of
recovery
that
may
be
had
on
tax
refund
claims.
as
we
recount
in
our
brief,
recent
decisions
of
the
first,
fourth,
tenth,
and
eleventh
circuits
have
held
to
the
contrary.
our
submission
is
that
those
four
circuits
reach
a
result
that
is
required
by
the
text
of
the
interrelated
statutory
provisions
that
govern
here,
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
statutory
text
now,
which
is
set
out
at
pages
2
to
4
of
the
government's
brief.
and
we
start
with
the
last
of
the
provisions
that
set
out
section
7422(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
the
term
before
last
in
united
states
v.
williams
this
court
referred
to
as
a
provision
that
requires
administrative
exhaustion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief,
in
the
gray
covers,
and
it
says
that
no
suit
or
proceeding
shall
be
maintained
in
any
courts,
skipping
down,
until...
for
a
refund,
until
a
claim
for
refund
or
credit
has
been
duly
filed
with
the
secretary
according
to
the
provisions
of
law
in
that
regard.
and
the
controlling
provisions
in
our
view
are
those
set
forth
on
the
preceding
two
pages,
the
various
provisions
of
section
6511
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and...
and
that
section
starts
off
in
subsection
(a)
with
a
statement
of
a
period
of
limitation
on
filing
a
refund
claim
with
the
internal
revenue
service.
for
present
purposes,
since
a
tax
return
is
required
for
an
income
tax,
the
claim
must
be
filed
within
3
years
from
the
time
the
return
was
filed,
or
2
years
from
the
time
the
tax
was
paid.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
mundy
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
not
part
of
the
duties
that
i
have--
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
hasn't
actually
been
a
provision
offered.
there
was
an
announcement
that
a
provision
was
being
prepared--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--for
offering,
but
it
still
has
not
been
offered.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are...
it's
under
study.
i'm
not
privy
to
the
discussions.
there
are
inherent
difficulties
in
addressing
this
question
because
of
the
massive
number
of
returns
that
are
filed
every
year,
difficulties
that
we've
referred
to
in
this--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
don't
really
have
an
answer
to
that.
there
was,
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
no
explanation
of
why
this
change
occurred
in
the
text.
this
is
a
question
that
in
the
mundy
case
last
term
the
court
found
no
occasion
to
reach,
and
it
seldom
makes
a
difference,
because
it
can
make
a
difference
only
if
the...
in
a
1-year
period,
because
either
you
can...
you
can
go
back
3
years
from
when
the
return
was
filed
to
see...
to
ask
for
refunds
of
taxes
paid
during
those
3
years,
or
else
2
years
after
the
tax
was
paid,
and
usually
with
a
really
late-filed
return
no
taxes
were
paid
within
the
3
years
or
the
2
years,
and
it
makes
no
difference,
as
it
makes
no
difference
in
either
of
the
cases
before
us.
in
any
event,
let
me
proceed
now
to
the
next
provision,
and
for
our
purposes
the
more
important
provision,
subsection
(b),
which
appears
on
page
3
of
the
government's
brief,
and
it
starts
off
with
a
subsection
(1),
which
states
quite
unequivocally
the
consequences
if
the
claim
is
not
filed
within
the
prescribed
period.
no
credit
or
refund
shall
be
allowed.
now,
that...
it's
hard
to
see
that
that
provision
has
much
purpose
other
than
to
emphasize
the
strictness
of
the
filing
requirements
and,
as
we
point
out
on
page
20
of
our
brief,
this
point
is
reemphasized
in
another
provision
of
the
code,
section
6514(a)(1),
which
states
that
any
credit
or
refund
which
the
service
actually
gives
on
a
claim
that
is
filed
after
the
expiration
of
the
statutory
periods
of
limitation
is
"erroneous"
and
"considered
void".
and
it's
interesting
that
in
the
implementing
regulation
for
that
provision,
section
6514,
the
service,
after
tracking
the
language
of
the
statute,
then
has
a
cross-reference
to
the
provisions
authorized
in
suit
by
the
government
to
recover
erroneous
refunds.
but
the
next
subsection
seems
to
us
to
be
what
i
might
refer
to
as
the
clincher,
the
most
dispositive
obstacle
to
the
respondents
and
the
ninth
circuit's
position
in
this
case,
and
that
is
subsection
(2)
of
subsection
(b),
which
is
captioned,
limit
on
the
amount
of
credit
or
refund
that
can
be
given,
and
i
cannot
emphasize
too
strongly
that
these
caps
on
the
disbursement
that
can
be
made
from
the
federal
treasury
have
their
own
express
limitation.
while
there
is
a
cross-reference
to
the
claims
limitation
period
for
purpose
of
separating
categories
of
claims,
there
is
no
cross-reference
to
the
claims
limitation
for
purpose
of
defining
the
cap
itself.
it
says
in
subsection
(a),
for
example,
the
amount
of
credit
or
refund
shall
not
exceed
the
portion
of
the
tax
paid
within
a
period
defined
right
in
this
provision
equal
to
3
years
plus
the
period
of
any
extension
of
time
for
filing
the
return,
and
in
subsection
(b)
it's
the
same
thing,
that
the
amount
of
credit
or
refund
shall
not
exceed
the
portion
of
the
tax
paid
during
the
2
years
immediately
preceding
the
filing
of
the
claim.
these
are
substantive
limitations
on
disbursements
from
the
treasury
that
are
authorized.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
not,
justice
stevens.
the
government
can
decide
not
to
oppose
a
private
bill
in
congress--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
the
facts
warrant
it,
which
might
more--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
depends
on
which
case
you're
talking
about.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
two
cases
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
i'll
get
into
the
facts
a
little
bit
more.
perhaps
the
webb
case,
which
is
being
held
on
petition
from
the
fourth
circuit,
is
one
where
there
is
more
clearly
been
a
finding
in
the
state
courts
in
related
litigation
about
precisely
what
happened,
so
that
there
is
less
room
for
questioning
the
factual
accuracy
of
a
look
back
at
the
date,
that
about
what
someone's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
looking
right
now
at
the
provision
which
seems
to
preclude
authority
in
the
irs--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that,
if
we
turn
to
the
top
of
page
4,
that
is
subsection
(c)
of
the
same
provision,
limited
no
claim
filed,
and
that
says
that
you
still
have
to
meet
the
time
limits
of
subsections
(a)
and
(b).
it's
very
hard
to
see
how
the
service
would
feel
authorized
to
make
a
disbursement
of
treasury
funds--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
this
situation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
is
under
study--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--just
in
the
treasury
department.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
can't...
would
i
personally--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
can't
say
that
we've
faced
up
to
that.
what...
all
we
have--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
have
been
rather
few.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
have
been
rather
few,
but
these
are
not
instigated
by
us,
after
all.
they're
instigated
by
the
taxpayers
if
they
can
get
a
congressional
sponsor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
don't
know
the
facts.
we
only
know
what
the
administrator's
affidavit,
the
daughter's
affidavit
said
4
years
after...
more
than
4-1/2
years
after--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--after
the
events
occurred
here.
it's...
there
wasn't
any
contemporaneous
finding
about
whether
this
man
had
the
capacity
or
not.
the
receipt
by
the
irs
was
not
an
unusual
one.
oftentimes
elderly
taxpayers
have
capital
gains
or
other
sudden
increases
in
income,
and
there
was
no
explanation
for
it.
the
check
merely
accompanied
an
extension
of
time
request.
obviously,
the
family
was
in
a
better
position
to
be
monitoring
his
financial
affairs
than
the
internal
revenue
service
was,
and
could
have
looked
into
his
bank
accounts
if
they
thought
at
the
time
that
there
was
lack
of
capacity.
they're
now
saying,
4-1/2
years
later,
that
there
was
lack
of
capacity
at
a
time
when
it's
difficult
to
prove
it,
and
this
kind
of
claim
can
be
made
in
many
cases.
i
might,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
we're
into
the
facts,
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
facts
in
the
scott
case,
where
there
was
actually
a
bench
trial,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
could
be
something
of
that
sort.
it
could
be
temporally
limited.
they
could
expand
the
time
perious
upon
a
showing
of
certain
kinds
of
incapacity,
but
they
could
expand
them
for
only
a
limited
time,
because
each
year
you
expand
it
you're
adding
another
200
million
tax
returns
that
possibly
could
be
reopened
at
a
time
when
there's
talk
about
downsizing
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
at
a
time
when
there
are
budget
constraints.
and
in
order
for
legislation
of
this
kind
to
be
adopted,
congress
needs
help
in
preparing
a
revenue
impact
assessment
of
it,
rather
hard
to
do,
since
we
don't
know
easily
how
to
estimate
how
many
additional
out
of
time
refund
claims
might
be
stimulated
once
there
were
a
provision
that
allowed
consideration
of
the
individual
circumstances
of
taxpayers.
the
service
has
estimated
that
it
now
turns
down
about
250,000
refund
claims
a
year
in
whole,
without
examining
whether
the
refund
was
warranted
or
not
because
they're
out
of
time,
but
most
tax
counsel
who
wouldn't
file
an
out-of-time
refund
claim
today
on
behalf
of
a
client,
might...
that
figure
might
increase
a
great
deal.
so
another
possible
legislative
response
to
this
would
be
simply
to
increase
the
limitations
periods
in
the
hope
that
more
situations
such
as
the
alleged
situation
of
mr.
mcgill
would
be
caught
without
having
to
examine
the
individual
circumstances
of
individual
taxpayers,
just
to
give
their
guardians
or
relatives
more
time
in
which
to
ferret
out
examples
of
this
kind,
which
would
be
much
less
administratively
burden...
there
are
all
kinds
of
possibilities,
but
to
date
nothing
has
been
proposed
by
the
administration
to
the
congress,
nor
am
i...
we'll
of
course
inform
the
court
if
any
action
is
taken
either
on
the
hill
or
by
the
administration.
in
the
meantime,
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
press
release
that
was
issued
was
issued
on
the
premise
that
the
existing
law
bars
such
claims,
as
we
think
these
caps
on
the
refund
do,
and
there's
no
point
in
saying
that
the
claim
can
be
allowed
for
a
longer
period
if
you
can't
get
any
payment
as
a
result
of
filing
the
claim.
so
read
as
a
whole,
the
provision
is
inconsistent
with
equitable
tolling,
as
the
court
concluded
the
applicable
provisions
in
the
lampf
case
were,
and
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
with
respect
to
an
express
cap
on
disbursements
from
the
treasury
there
is
no
more
fitting
example
of
where
the
traditional
rules
about
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
should
be
applied.
when
congress
has
explicitly
capped
the
disbursement
that
is
authorized
to
be
made,
that
cannot
be
enlarged
beyond
what
the
language
requires.
as
the
court
has
said
about
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity,
a
court
is
not
in
a
position
to
enlarge
it
on
equitable
grounds.
it's
quite
different
from
just
a
statute
of
limitations
on
the
filing
of
the
claim
itself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
dalm
case
really
addresses
everything
that's
at
issue
here.
what
was
asked
for
in
dalm,
an
expansion
of
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment,
was
an
equitable
claim
very
similar
to
a
tolling
claim,
and
some
would
refer
to
it
as
a
tolling
claim.
it's
a
form
of
claim
for
avoidance
of
the
limitations
period
that
isn't
as
precisely
defined
a
deferral
of
the
limitations
period
as
the
ordinary
tolling
claim,
but
it's
very
similar,
and
we
think
the
dalm
decision
does
have
a
controlling
analysis
here,
and
in
particular
its
holding
that
these
provisions
concerning
tax
refund
suits
must
be
read
in
conformity
with
one
another
and
with
all
the
cross-referencing
that's
involved
here.
let
me
just
talk
very
briefly
about
the
facts
of
the
scott
case
to
show
what
kind
of
thing
we're
concerned
with
here,
and
in
scott
we
proceeded
all
the
way
to
a
bench
trial
with
findings,
and
some
of
those
findings
which
are
set
forth
on
pages
44a
and
45a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition
are
rather
telling
here.
for
one
thing--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no,
what...
we
have
both
of
them
together,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
were
decided
as
companion
cases
and
we
petitioned
in
the
two
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
of
appeals
decided
to
put
the
brockamp
case
forward--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--as
one
where
perhaps
the
service's
problems
were
not
quite
as
apparent
as
they
would
be
in
the
scott
case
from
our
standpoint.
the
companion
case
in
scott
involved
his
1984
tax
liability.
what
the
service
knew
was
that
he
himself,
even
though
the
claim
now
is
incapacity
because
of
alcoholism,
he
himself
had
filed
in
january
of
1985
his
estimated
tax
return
and
payment.
his
father
had
done
that
with
his
prior
installments
of
estimated
tax
for
1984.
and
then
through
the
bench
trial
proceedings
we
were
able
to
find
out
some
facts
which
we...
which
the
district
court
has
listed
on
page
44a
and
45a,
that
in
1984
scott
executed
a
partnership
agreement
to
operate
a
retail
wine
shop.
in
1985,
he
entered
into
an
agreement
dissolving
the
partnership
so
that
he
could
operate
the
shop
on
his
own.
during
the
time
he
operated,
he
filed
his
state
sales
tax,
and
he
obtained
an
attorney
to
represent
him
on
driving
under
the
influence
charges
in
'87
and
'88.
he
opened
and
closed
his
retail
business
every
day
and
paid
his
utilities
and
rent.
so
even
on
the
basis
of
what
we
were
able
to
learn
through
a
trial
there
was
considerable
doubt.
the
district
court
itself
said
without
the
expert
testimony
in
this
case,
and
i'm
reading
from
finding
21,
the
court
might
otherwise
find
the
united
states'
argument
somewhat
persuasive.
of
course,
expert
testimony
is
something
that
doesn't
occur
until
the
trial
itself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
about
how
alcoholism
can
be
incapacitating,
but...
and
there
were
two
doctors,
one
for
the
government
and
one
for
the
defense,
but
obviously
the
service
would
have
to
be
very
wary,
the
more
a
claim
of
incapacity
seems
specific
only
to
the
capacity
to
comply
with
the
internal
revenue
laws
and
leaves
the
person
able
to
comply
with
many
other
laws.
the
administrative
finding
of...
in
such
a
case
would
not
be
one
where
the
service
could
easily
decide
that
it
was
an
appropriate
occasion
for
tolling.
these
are
very
difficult
matters
to
handle.
they're
not
the
kind
of
green
eyeshade
investigations
of
a
tax
return
that
service
personnel
are
ordinarily
engaged
in,
nor
are
the
facts
easily
assembled.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
very
difficult
administrative
question,
and
one
that
both
the
administration
and
congress
may
give
appropriate
consideration
to,
but
they
obviously
have
to
tread
with
caution,
considering
the
magnitude
of
the
task
that
is
assigned
to
the
service.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
irwin,
the
court
recognized
that
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
unequivocally
expressed,
and
then
said
that
once
congress
had
made
such
a
waiver
we
think
the
rule
of
equitable
tolling
should
be
applicable
to
suits
against
the
government
in
the
same
way
as
to
suits
against
private
defendants,
and
that
amounts
to
little,
if
any,
broadening
of
the
congressional
waiver.
those...
that
rationale
applies
to
tolling
of
the
limitations
for
filing
suit,
or
for
filing
claims.
it
really
is
not
addressed
to
the
obstacle
here,
which
is
a
substantive
limitation,
a
cap
that
congress
has
imposed
on
the
amount
of
the
refund
that's
authorized
to
be
disbursed
from
the
federal
treasury
and,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
therefore
it
would
require
a
broadening
of
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
beyond
the
express
terms
of
the
waiver
to
rule
that
a
court
may
override
this
cap
in
the
very
sensitive
area
of
disbursements
from
the
treasury,
the
area
that
is
most
related
to
the
constitutional
underpinnings
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
itself,
including
the
provision
we
have
pointed
to
in
the
constitution,
in
article
i,
section
9,
clause
7,
that
no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
but
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law.
now,
it
is
the
fact
that
in
webb
the
fourth
circuit
suggested
some
ways
of
reading
the
rebuttable
presumption
in
irwin
more
narrowly,
and
we
have
done
the
same
thing
in
a
pending
petition
and
reply
brief
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
fagin
involving
the
quiet
title
act,
which
we
have
suggested
that
the
court
hold
for
the
decision
in
this
case.
but...
and
i
think
that
these
suggestions
are
well
worthy
of
consideration,
and
the
court
in
webb
at
the
conclusion
of
its
opinion
pointed
out
some
other
areas
involving
other
federal
statutes
where
various
courts
have
held
that
the
rebuttable
presumption
has
been
overcome
even
if
the
presumption
of
irwin
does
apply,
but
in
this
particular
case
we're
really
beyond
the
area
where
it's
just
a
limitation
on
the
filing
of
the
claim
that's
at
issue.
if
the
court
has
no
further--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
the
claim
to
the
service.
there's
a
separate
provision
involving
limitations
on
filing
the
suit,
and
that
has
to
be
within
2
years
after
the
disallowance
of
the
claim.
that
is
section
6532(a)(1)
of
title
26.
