we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-1225,
united
states
v.
marian
brockamp.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
found
on
page
4?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
only
case
we
have
before
us
is
the
brockamp
case,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
go
ahead,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
expert
testimony
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
klueger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
have
a
rather
elaborate
internal
revenue
code
where
presumably
congress
has
revealed
its
intent
in
the
sections
that
are
dealt
with
in
the
briefs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
explain
how
your
interpretation
of
6511
apply
to
the
particular
facts
of
your
case
so
as
to
allow
your
client
to
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
you
say
6511
you
say
is
the
key.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
would
you
apply
this
to
the
facts
of
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
you
just
read
right
into
the
very
specific
provisions
of
(b)(2)(b)
some
kind
of
equity
principle?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dalm,
i
mean,
dalm
refused
to
do
that
in
a
similar
situation.
dalm
was
decided
just
about
the
same
time
as
irwin
was,
which
suggests
that
perhaps
you
don't
go
into
equitable
tolling
when
you're
dealing
with
something
as
complicated
as
the
internal
revenue
code.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dalm
was
decided
after
irwin,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
government
is
bound
by
the
dissent's
view
of
the
opinion
in
dalm?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
finish
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
klueger.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
