john
paul

mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you
a
general...
assume
we
agree
with
every...
all
of
your
arguments,
and
that
it's
too
late
to
file
a
claim
and
the
taxpayer,
or
this
person,
he's
not
really
a
taxpayer,
i
guess,
has
no
right
to
get
the
money
back,
is
there
anything
in
the
code
that
would
allow
the
internal
revenue
service
when
presented
with
facts
as
extreme
as
they
are
in
this
case
to
say,
we're
not
entitled
to
this
$7,000,
we
want
to
give
it
back?
is
there
anything
that
allows
the
government
to
give
back
money
they
know
they're
not
entitled
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
they
probably
would
in
this
case,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
one
of
these
cases--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
just
assuming
a
case
where
you
really
didn't
dispute
the
facts,
but
you
still
would
have
no
authority
to
give
the
money
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
only
speaks
in
terms
of
claims.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
claims.
i'm
assuming
a
fact
situation
in
which
there's
no
"claim"
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
a
discovery
that
we've
got
$7,000
that
obviously
doesn't
belong
to
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
see,
it
could
be
within
2
years
of
the
time
that
the
heirs
discovered
that
the
money
had
been
mistakenly
paid.
would
that
be
enough?
i
suppose
that...
i
don't
know
why
the
death
is
the
critical
point.
it
seems
to
me
in
most
of
these
doctrines
it's
when
the
claimant
discovers
the
cause
of
action,
that
if
you
say,
he's...
you
know,
there's
an
excusable
failure
to
get
the
facts
sooner,
so
i
don't
know
why
the
death
is
critical.
it
seems
to
me
the--
--it's
only
critical
because
of
the
way
justice
breyer
put
the
question.
you
would
have
to
say
no,
justice
breyer,
not
just
disability,
but
disability--
--or
other
excusable
reason.
or
anything--
--yes,
anything
else
that
justifies
the
failure
to
file.
which
makes
it
a
little
harder.
which
is
lack
of
discovery.
it's
getting
to
be
a
pretty
long
provision
that
we're
writing
here.
[laughter]
well,
that's
right,
but
that's
you're...
i
think
that's
your...
i'm
not
sure,
is
your
theory
one
of
just
disability,
or
is
it
inability
to
discover?
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
why
isn't
the...
if
the
heir,
i
mean,
the
administrator
of
the
estate,
or
whoever
it
is,
doesn't
find
the
records
for
2
or
3
years,
the
administrator
was
equally
disabled.
it's
not
because
of
a
mental
disability.
it's
just
because
she
didn't
have
the
facts.
i
mean,
i
just
am
not
sure
that
you've
got
a
principle
here
unless
you
extend
it
beyond
the
period
you're
relying
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
dalm
case
that
was...
at
least
some
of
us
thought
that
the
government
was
guilty
of
inequitable
conduct,
and
here
you
don't
have
any
claim
of
inequitable
conduct
against
the
government,
do
you,
so
in
a
sense
the
government's
case
is
perhaps
stronger
here
than
it
was
in
dalm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
probably
didn't
read
the
dissent,
then,
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
correct,
am
i
not,
that
you
are
not
accusing
the
government
of
inequitable
conduct
in
this
case?
