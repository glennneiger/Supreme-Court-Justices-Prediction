justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
stovall,
may
i
ask
you
whether...
how
you
fit
this
kind
of
a
law
into
any
situation
with
which
we
have
previously
dealt?
it
seems
to
be
kind
of
a
new
category
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--confinement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
this
be
cabined
in
the
future,
do
you
think,
if
we
uphold
it?
could
a
state
lock
up
any
kind
of
violent
offender
who's
diagnosed
as
having
a
mental
abnormality
of
some
kind,
not
mentally
ill,
and
at
the
same
time
be
likely
to
commit
more
crimes
in
the
future?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
of
mental
illness,
but
of
some
kind
of
mental
aberration
or
personality
disorder.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
you
just
answer
the
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
kansas
providing
any
treatment
for
these
people?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
kind
of
treatment,
other
than
locking
them
up
in
a
special
ward?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
that?
it
doesn't
mean
anything
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
kind
of
treatment
is
that?
i
just
don't
understand.
are
you
trying
to
train
people
to
think
differently,
or
what
is
the
treatment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
the
court
in
baxstrom
uphold
essentially
the
notion
that
the
state
could
commit
people
after
they
were
released
from
prison
in
a
civil
commitment
proceeding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
we
have
left
largely
to
the
states
to
define
what
constitutes
a
mental
illness
within
that
framework.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
maybe
this
boils
down
to
whether
this
particular
condition
of
pedophilia,
or
however
you
pronounce
it,
qualifies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
this
specific
condition
of
pedophilia
and
whether
that
is
open
to
the
state
to
include
within
the
broad
concept
of
some
kind
of
mental
illness.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
court
has
suggested
that
may
not
be
so,
but
is
this
a
different
kind
of
category
of
mental
aberration?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
opposed
to
a
tendency
to
have
an
antisocial
personality.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
didn't
use
those
words,
punishment,
did
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
say
that
no
treatment
is
being
provided
now
to
your
client?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
about
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
no
question,
i
gather,
that
this
man
is
very
much
likely
to
commit
sexual
offenses
against
children
in
the
future,
if
released.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
strong
evidence
to
that
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
children.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
have
a
person
here
who's
been
convicted
at
least
of
two
offenses
most
immediately
and,
i
gather,
some
in
the
past.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
we
all
know
as
a
practical
matter
that's
not
very
effective,
many
times.
we
read
about
it
every
day,
and
i
guess
we
don't
have
to
avoid
that
kind
of
general
awareness
of
concern
about
just
saying
on
a
piece
of
paper,
don't
go
near
a
schoolyard
and
don't
do
this
again.
it
just
isn't
very
effective
with
someone
with
this
abnormality,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
allen
v.
illinois
certainly
upheld
a
civil
commitment
of
persons
charged
with
sexual
offenses
who
are
sexually
dangerous
persons
suffering
from
a
mental
disorder
and
having
criminal
propensities
to
the
commission
of
sex
offenders...
offenses,
particularly,
in
that
case,
sexual
molestation
of
children.
now,
the
court
upheld
that
notion,
and
referred
to
a
mental
disorder.
the
only
difference
was
that
in
that
case
it
was
offered
as
an
alternative
to
incarceration
for
the
criminal
offense
as
opposed
to
here,
where
it
is
proposed
subsequent
to
serving
the
sentence.
now,
does
that
make
a
big
difference
if
it
in
fact
is
a
civil
commitment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
just
asking
you
if
that
one
factor
should
make
a
difference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
statute
doesn't
refer
to
that.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
a
mental
disorder,
having
criminal
propensities
to
the
commission
of
sex
offenses,
and
it's
not
at
all
this
situation.
