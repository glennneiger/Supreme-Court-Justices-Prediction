ms.
carla
j.
stovall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
throughout
the
decades,
the
states
have
developed
three
basic
ways
to
deal
with
persons
who
commit
sex
crimes:
criminal
punishment,
treatment
in
lieu
of
sentencing,
and
the
law
that
you
have
before
you
today,
kansas's
sexually
violent
predator
law,
which
is
a
hybrid
of
both.
leroy
hendricks
has
experienced
all
three
during
his
40-year
history
of
sexually
molesting
children.
it
was
the
goal
of
the
kansas
legislature
by
providing
for
treatment
subsequent
to
punishment
that
we
could
succeed
where
the
other
procedures
have
failed,
enabling
kansas
to
reduce
the
risk
that
leroy
hendricks
poses
to
our
children.
the
civil
commitment
of
sex
offenders
who
suffer
from
a
mental
condition
linked
to
their
sex
crimes
has
been
approved
by
this
court
on
two
prior
occasions,
by
pearson
in
1940
and
allen
in
1986.
the
court's
guidance
in
what
is
the
constitutional
minimal
for
an
acceptable
level
of
mental
condition
for
commitment
is
found
in
the
addington
decision,
wherein
the
court
proscribed
confinement
for
merely
idiosyncratic
behavior,
or
conduct
that
is
not
within
the
generally
acceptable
bounds
of
conduct.
surely
no
one
would
argue
that
leroy
hendricks
was
engaging
in
merely
idiosyncratic
behavior.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
only
insofar
as
that
we
have--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--treated
subsequent
to
punishment,
your
honor,
instead
of
treatment
in
lieu
of
sentencing.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
as
long
as
the
state
could
show
that
there's
a
medical
justification
for
a
diagnosis
and
that
we
can
show
dangerousness--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--well,
the
term
mental
illness
is
one
that
this
court
has
certainly
used
in
its
decisions
but
never
defined
and,
in
fact,
in
addington,
where
the
language
of
mental
illness
was
used,
the
court
also
used
mental
disorder,
mental
disease,
emotional
disorder,
emotional
disturbance,
almost
synonymously
and
interchangeably,
and
so
i
would
submit
the
mental
abnormality
that
kansas
has
in
our
statute
is
not
different
from
those
things
that
you
have
previously
approved.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
and
i'm
a
lay
person
in
that
regard,
too,
your
honor,
but
when
you
look,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
dsm,
where
we...
where
the
psychiatric
profession
describes
particular
kinds
of
condition,
the
things
that
the
medical
community
tends
to
understand
would
fit
within
this
definition
would
be
two
paraphilias,
which
are
pedophilia
and
sexual
sadism,
which
are
terms
that
have
been
recognized
by
the
community
and
still
would
fit
within
this
definition.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
justice
ginsburg,
that's
exactly
right,
and
that's
what
the
state
of
kansas
would
ask
us...
ask
you
to
do,
so
long
as
we
still
have
a
mental
justification,
a
medical
justification
for
commitment
and
we
show
dangerousness.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that's
true,
justice
kennedy,
and
in
fact
the
dsm
in
the
beginning
of
the
introduction
part
says
that
this
was
not
created
for
legal
use
or
for
forensic
meaning,
but
it's
to
aid
the
psychiatric
profession
in
making
some
diagnosis
that
they
then
can
apply
to
this
definition
in
the
kansas
statute
of
mental
abnormality.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it's
a
hybrid...
i'm
sorry.
it's
a
hybrid
between
criminal
sentencing
and
treatment
in
lieu
of
punishment,
but
it's
clearly
a
civil
commitment.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
yes.
in
fact,
this
court
has
specifically
approved
in
baxstrom
in
1966
being
able
to
civilly
commit
mentally
ill
inmates
at
the
conclusion
of
their
prison
sentence,
and
so
this
is
no
different
than
what
you
have
approved
previously,
except
that
we
have
crafted
out
a
very
specific
mental
commitment
statute
for
this
particular
group
of
offenders.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
be
true
for
leroy
hendricks,
who
certainly
is
the
respondent
here,
but
kansas
in
our
prison
system
has
the
ability
and,
in
fact,
requires
inmates
that
are
convicted
of
sex
offenses
to
go
through
treatment,
so
they
do
have
the
ability
while
receiving
treatment
in
prison
to
shed
themselves
not
of
the
diagnosis
of
pedophilia,
for
example,
but
of
the
later
part
of
the
definition,
which
is
being
likely
to
continue
to
engage
in
predatory
acts
of
sexual
violence,
because
they've
gone
through
treatment.
and
so
we
have
seen
that
happen,
that
if
they
complete
treatment,
they
might
not
have
the
abnormality
on
the
inside,
whereas
your
question
was,
are
they
going
to
come
in
with
it.
they're
not
going
to
develop
one
while
they're
in,
so
if
they
come
in
with
one,
then
they
will
have
that
before
they
enter
the
prison--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--there
are
many
studies
that
were
cited
in
our
brief,
justice
kennedy.
two
that
come
to
mind
talk
about
the
efficacy
of
treatment
of
a
cognitive
behavioral-based
treatment
which
is
what
we
provide,
and
that
is
certainly
the
state
of
the
art
now
in
the
psychiatric
community
for
sex
offenders.
one
study
would
show
that
people
that
went
through
treatment
had
an
8-percent
rate
of
recidivism,
whereas
people
that
didn't
go
through
had
a
20-percent
rate,
and
that
was
coming
out
of
a
state
hospital
in
california,
so
it
was
a
confined
environment.
i--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--justice
scalia,
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
judge
and
jury
to
decide.
a
psychiatric
professional
would
have
to
make
the
determination.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
the
jury
instructions
in
kansas
just
simply
ask
them
to
find
whether
or
not
he
is
likely
to
continue
to
engage
in
predatory
acts
of
sexual
violence.
the
testimony
at
the
trial--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--i
would
be
willing
to
assert
that
it's
51
percent,
justice
scalia,
and
the
testimony
at
the
trial--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--there
has
been
no
determination
as
to
what
percent
that
is,
and
we
don't
give
that
guidance
to
the
jury
in
kansas,
but
dr.
befort,
who
testified
at
the
sex
predator
trial,
testified
in
his
view
that...
he
was
saying
that
mr.
hendricks
would
reoffend
within
a
51-percent
chance.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
don't
give
any
more
of
that
decision
within
our
statute
as
well,
but--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--what
kansas
has
done
is
to
provide
for
treatment,
and
i
think
that's
all
that
we
have
to
do,
and
not
show
that
mr.
hendricks,
for
example--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--let
me
clarify,
justice
scalia.
do
you
mean
for
the
particular
person
being--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--i
think
in
that
case
we
still
have
the
ability
to
commit
an
individual,
because
we're
providing
for
the
treatment.
we're
doing
everything
that
we
can--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--but
we
don't...
i
don't
know
that
we--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--the
court
has
never
required,
in
my
understanding,
for
a
state
to
be
able
to
show
that
a
cure
is
guaranteed
for
somebody
or
that
they
will
necessarily
benefit
from
it,
and
so--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--absolutely,
justice
souter.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
as
long
as
we
show
dangerousness
as
well.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
mean,
i
think
we
have
that
obligation
as
well.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
would
agree
with
that.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
justice
o'connor,
what
the
kansas
supreme
court
did
was
look
at
one
prior
district
court
ruling
in
the...
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
found
that
there
was
treatment.
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
proceeding
at
the
trial
level
found
there
was
treatment
in
kansas.
the
supreme
court
seemed
to
not
question
that
there
was
some
level
of
treatment
in
kansas
but
questioned
the
efficacy
of
treatment
in
the
community
in
general.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
they--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--cognitive
behavioral-based
treatment.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it
didn't
to
me
in
the
beginning
of
this
case
either,
justice
o'connor.
it
is
a...
it's
a
method
of
looking
at
the
cognitive
distortion
somebody
has,
the
maladaptive
thinking
patterns
that
lead
them
to
commit
maladaptive
behavior.
within
this
context
it's
sexual
behavior.
in
addition
to
that--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--part
of
it
does
have
to
do
with
stopping
those
thinking
patterns,
helping
them
identify,
for
one
thing,
what
their
thinking
patterns
are
that
are
maladaptive
and
not
like
the
rest
of
us,
and
then
how
to
stop
the
behavior,
how
to
stop
the
thinking
patterns
from
leading
directly
into
that
behavior,
and
there
is
certainly
some
level
of
behavior
modification
in
the
program.
they
receive
31-1/2
hours
of
treatment
per
week.
part
of
it
is
this
cognitive-based
theory
as
well
as
the
general
issues
of
social
skills,
self-esteem,
anger
management,
rebuilding
relationships,
family
issues,
value
clarifications,
the
gamut
of
treatment--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--but
the--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--the
definition
of
mental
abnormality
in
our
kansas
statute
is
that
it
is
a
congenital
or
an
acquired
condition,
and
that--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--you're
correct,
justice
o...
justice
kennedy.
the
treatment
is
a
combination
of
both
cognitive
restructuring
as
well
as
behavior
modification,
and
so
they
need
to
initially
be
able
to
identify
the
cognitive...
the
thinking
distortions
that
occur
instead
of
just...
like,
30
years
ago
all
we
would
have
done
is
sort
of
the
12-step
addiction
model,
try
to
deal
with
the
behavior
and
not
the
thought
processes
that
preceded
that
behavior.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
think
so,
justice
stevens.
what
kansas
has
chosen
to
do,
though--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--it's
somewhat
evidence
of
that,
as
well
as
it's
a
limiting
of
kansas'
decision
who
to
commit.
we
can't
just
pick
somebody
off
the
street--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--oh,
constitutionally
i
think
that
we
could,
but
the
legislature
chose
to
very
narrowly
define--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--because
the
idea
is
that
we're
trying
to
identify
those
that
pose
the
greatest
risk
to
the
community.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
there
are
certainly
those
that
would
argue,
justice
stevens,
that
we
should
have
more
expanded
the
law--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--to
include
more
people
in
it,
but
that's
not
what
the
legislature
chose
to
do,
though.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
more
likely
than
not
about
the
dangerousness,
but
the
state
has
a
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--exactly.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
think
this
court
has...
as
i
read
decisions
of
the
court
has
never
been
extremely
clear
as
to
whether
or
not
treatment
is
absolutely
required.
i'm
fortunate
that
we
don't
have
that
issue
in
kansas
because
we
do
provide
for
treatment.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
think
it's--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--and
mr.
hendricks'
certainly
would
have
the
ability
to
file
a
habeas
action
in
either
state
or
federal
court
challenging
that
if
he
were
not
getting
any
sort
of
treatment
at
all,
or
if
he
was
unable
to
be
released
without...
for
that
reason.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
well,
it
is
for
us.
it's
an
easy
call
to
make
for
us,
justice
kennedy,
because
we
do
provide
for
treatment.
whether
or
not--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--i
think
that
that's
correct,
that
that's...
the
decisions
have
indicated
by
some
justices
that
there
need
to
be
some
level
of
treatment
and
others
have
sort
of
left
the
door
open,
but
from
kansas'
standpoint
it's
an
easier
call
because
we
clearly
do
provide
treatment.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
if
i
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it
is
somewhat,
although
for
the
last
60
years
states
have
been
dealing
with
a
way
to
be
able
to
civilly
detain
sex
offenders
in
particular.
they've
not
looked
to
do
that
for
arsonists
or
others,
but
in
the...
in
1940
this
court
approved
the
pearson
decision
that
did
allow
for
commitment
of
someone
with
a
sex
offense.
but
i
think
justice
o'connor
in
the
beginning
asked
the
question
that
i
think
relates
to
this,
and
that
is,
i
think
as
long
as
a
state
can
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
medically
justified
condition
and
that
there
is
a
manifestation
of
a
threat
to
be
the
dangerousness
element,
that
a
state
probably
could
do
that
if
there
was
some
level
of
harm
that
they
were
trying
to
prevent
and
identify.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
think
clear
and
convincing
would
be
sufficient
from
a
constitutional
perspective.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
but
only
one
of
the
elements,
though,
of
the
definition
would
be
likely
to--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--right,
and
the
other
is
the
mental
abnormality,
and
taken
in
totality
we
have
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
show
that.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
well,
i
still
think
overall
the
state
has
to
be
able
to
sustain
that
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
think
even
if
you--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--medically
justified.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
don't
think
we
are
limited,
justice
souter,
just
to
the
dsm,
but
i
think
certainly
the
psychiatric
community
has
to
believe
that
this
is
a
condition
that
they
can
identify
and
diagnose,
but
it
would
not--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--that
would
not
be
the
argument
the
state
would
make.
we're
very
comfortable
with
the
fact
that
what
we're
describing
is
medically
justified.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
i
think
so
that
the
court
doesn't
worry
that
we
confine
merely
for
dangerousness
or
merely
for
a
class
of
people
that
we
don't
want
to
be
around.
we
need
to...
to
be
able
to
civilly
commit
and
provide
treatment
for
them
it
has
to
be
a
medically
recognized
condition,
i--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--that
would
be
correct.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
they
would
say
that
they're
not
curable,
but
not
necessarily
not
treatable.
perhaps
i
should
try
to
take
the
discussion
to
the
criminal
side
of
things
and
address
the
issues
that
you
accepted
the
cross-petition
on
of
mr.
hendricks.
the
state
maintains
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
sanction
as
leroy
hendricks
indicates.
a
prior...
the
allen
v.
illinois
case
in
1986
is
the
one
that
we
would
ask
you
to
turn
the
attention
to,
because
it
is
so
similar.
while
it
did
provide
for
commitment
instead
of
punishment,
admittedly,
there's
no
reason
from
a
constitutional
perspective
that
that
should
be
significant.
when
you
looked
at
the
allen
decision,
the
similarities
between
the
illinois
statute
and
kansas
statutes
are
so
great,
and
you
found
that
to
be
a
civil
statute.
even
though
it
was
triggered
by
the
commission
of
a
crime,
you
found
that
that
only
limited
the
group
of
people
that
it
applied
to.
it
didn't
make
it
criminal.
even
though
the
state
in
that
case
had
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
a
burden,
even
though
illinois
extended
to
the
potential
sexually
dangerous
person
the
same
criminal
protections
in
terms
of
being
able
to
call
their
own
witnesses,
having
an
attorney,
a
jury
trial
and
the
like,
you
still
found
that
that
wasn't
criminal,
and
even
putting
the
individual
in
the
custody
of
the
secretary
of
corrections
and
putting
them
in
a
maximum
secured
facility
for
treatment
was
not
held
to
be
criminal.
those
are
all
the
same
kinds
of
things
that
we
do
in
the
state
of
kansas.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
justice
o'connor...
i'm
sorry.
justice
ginsburg,
it
was
in
1964
in
the
state
of
washington,
and
he
was
sent
there
under
a
psychopathic
personality
statute.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
in
washington
now,
you
mean?
it
was
in
1964
and
it
was
a
different
kind
of
commitment.
washington
just
has
their
sexually
violent
predator
statute
like
we
have
since
1990,
so
this
would
have
been
a
much
earlier
forerunner
of
what
the
current
version
is.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
thank
you
for
the
opportunity,
justice
kennedy.
the...
we
think
that
if
you
use
the
ursery
test,
which
mr.
hendricks'
counsel
supported
as
well,
you
look
to
see
what
the
legislative
intent
was.
was
it
civil
or
criminal?
the
language
in
our
preamble
and
throughout
the
statute
talks
about
civil,
so
if
it's
established
it's
criminal
on
the
face,
then
mr.
hendricks
has
the
burden
to
show
by
the
clearest
proof
that
the
application
is
so
punitive
that
it
becomes
criminal.
but
in
looking
at
the
kennedy
factors,
there
is
only
one
of
those
that
you
can
answer
yes
to,
and
that
is
that
indeed
we
have
a
disability,
an
affirmative
restraint
of
his
liberty.
we
don't
find
it
to
be
a
fundamental
restraint,
but
admittedly
it's
a
restraint.
but
the
rest
of
the
categories,
in
terms
of
whether
this
commitment
process
has
ever
been
historically
viewed
as
punishment,
we
would
answer
no.
we've
never
looked
at
civil
commitment
as
punishment.
it
does
not
come
into
play
only
on
the
criminal
conviction.
we
have
to
have
more
than
that.
we
have
to
have
the
mental
abnormality
and
there
has
to
be
the
likelihood
of
predatory
act.
it
doesn't
serve
the
traditional
aims
of
punishment
or
retribution
or
deterrence,
but
it
serves
the
aim
on
the
civil
side
of
incapacitation
and
treatment
so
we
can
change
this
behavior.
there
are...
when
you
run
through
the
seven
other
factors
there,
they
are
distinct
differences
as
to
why
it's
not
found
to
be
criminal.
the
allen
v.
illinois
statute
is
again
extremely
important
in
being
able
to
make
those
distinctions
between
civil
and
criminal,
and
we
would
ask
that
those
be
the
kinds
of
issues
that
you
look
at
in
making
this
decision.
when
you
look
at
the
rights
that
are
afforded
to
the
mentally
ill
inmates
and
the
sexually
violent
predators
that
are
in
kansas
custody
they
are
very
similar.
in
fact,
the
sexually
violent
predators
are
extended
the
same
bill
of
rights
that
the
mentally
ill
patients
have.
that's
not
the
case,
though,
when
you
look
at
department
of
correction
inmates
and
the
way
that
they
are
treated
versus
our
sexually
violent
predators.
there
is
distinct
differences
in
their
clothing,
their
personal
property,
their
telephone
and
visitation
privileges
and
the
like,
and
so
there's
a
tremendous
difference
there
as
well.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
because
one
of
the
requirements
in
our
definition
is
that
the
individual
go
to
a
secure
facility,
a
securely
confined
facility,
so
that
would
be
similar
to
the
hospitalization.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
excuse
me,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
it
is
one
of
the
elements,
justice
breyer,
that
we
have
to
show,
but
again
i
think
the
overall
burden
of
proof
of
being
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--the
addington
decision
clearly
talked
about,
for
civil
commitment
you
had
to
show
it
by
clear
and
convincing.
you're
right
but
it
was
more
than
just
simply
the
dangerousness
element.
it
also
was
that
you
had
to
show
the
mental
illness,
as
i
understand
it,
that
standard
itself.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
right,
and
we
clearly
do
that
in
terms
of
the
mental
abnormality,
and
i
understand
that's
where
the
issue
is
for
the
court,
but
you
still
have
to
show
the
likelihood
of
committing
that
harm
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
so
it's
showing
a
51-percent
burden
by
an
80-percent
burden--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--yes.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
that
would
be
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
there
has
only
been
one
court
in
kansas
that
would
have
looked
at
this
issue,
and
that
was
the...
the
kansas
supreme
court--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--made
that
final
determination,
and
that's
not
part
of
their
decision.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
they
relied
just
on--
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
--one
of
the
distinctions
is
the
level
of
personality
disorder
that
is
there.
ms.
carla
j.
stovall
the
indication
in
the
foucha
decision,
for
example,
was
that
simply
a
personality
disorder
might
not
be
enough
for
commitment,
and
that's
clearly
not
what
the
state
has
in
this
condition.
we
have
a
pedophile,
a
recognized
mental
disorder
that
is
subject
to
the
commitment,
and
so
the
mental
condition,
the
medically
justified
condition
is
so
much
greater
than
in
your
example.
