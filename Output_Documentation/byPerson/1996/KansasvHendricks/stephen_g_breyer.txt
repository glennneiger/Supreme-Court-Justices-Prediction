if
you
have
a
minute,
could
you
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
question?
in
addington,
i
take
it
the
court
held
that
you
must
have...
you
must
say,
based
on
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
does
frank
addington
require
hospitalization
in
a
mental
hospital
for
the
protection
of
others?
how
does
the
kansas
statute
meet
that
requirement
in
respect
to
requiring
hospitalization
for
the
protection
of
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
worried
about
the
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
worried
about
how,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
to
show
that
he
is
dangerous
to
others,
because
what
i
thought
you
said
is
in
kansas
you
don't
have
to
show
this
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
you
have
to
show
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
in
their
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
ask
you
another
question,
assuming
this
is
not
an
obstacle.
imagine
an
armed
robber
who
has
committed
many
armed
robberies,
and
a
psychologist
who
says
he
has
a
sociopathic
personality.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
do
you
believe
it
would
be
constitutional,
since
he
may...
lots
of
testimony...
commit
many
more
armed
robberies,
and
you
have
some
psychologists
who
say
he
has
sociopathic
personality,
would
it
be
constitutional
for
a
state
to
keep
him
under
the
correct
standard...
clear
and
convincing,
review
every
year,
we're
going
to
look
at
this
over
and
over...
confined
in
a
mental
hospital,
and
how
do
you
distinguish
that
case
from
this
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everyone
agrees
with
that,
i
think.
the
issue
is,
in
addition,
you
have
to
be
mentally
ill,
and
it's
like
civil
commitment,
and
how
do
you
decide
whether
for
legal
purposes
a
person
is
sufficiently
mentally
ill?
i
suppose
there
are
some
people
who
are
very
dangerous,
whom
every
psychiatrist
would
say
are
crazy
beyond
a
doubt
and
are
going
to
murder
15
other
people
unless
they're
locked
up,
and
i'm
assuming
that
it
would
be
possible
to
lock
up
that
person,
but
not
lock
up
somebody
who
commits
a
lot
of
crimes,
whom
every
psychiatrist
would
say
there's
nothing
wrong
with
except
he's
a
sociopath,
which
means
he
commits
a
lot
of
crimes,
all
right.
i
take
that
as
an
assumption.
so
what's
the
definition
distinguishing
the
one
from
another,
and
what
i'm
going
to
ask
you
about
is
the
ali's
definition,
which
had
for
a
different
purpose
to
say
that
a
person
was
insane
if,
as
a
result
in
part
of
a
mental
defect,
he
lacked
substantial
capacity,
in
this
case
it
would
be
to
conform
his
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
law,
which
would
suggest
a
kind
of
irresistible
impulse,
a
compulsion.
and
we
know
that
there
is
in
one
of
the
psychiatric
associations'
brief
evidence
that
some
psychiatrists
call
this
a
kind
of
compulsion,
so
is
the
ali
test
a
possible
test?
if
not,
what
is,
and
if
we
have
some
psychiatrists
saying
this
is
somewhat
compulsive,
and
others
saying
not,
what
do
we
do?
i
think
your
response
is
that
we
tried
this
test
for
criminal
conviction
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
mess.
is
there
any
reason
it's
likely
to
be
better
for
psychiatric
commitment?
it's
always
possible
to
get
somebody
to
come
in
with
evidence
on
one
or
the
other
side
of
that
irresistible
compulsion
rule.
the
courts
adopted
that
for
criminal...
for
insanity
defenses
and
it
turned
out
to
be
chaos.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
view,
then,
is
that
you
could
not
lock
up
a
person
whom
every
psychiatrist
would
say
has
a
totally
uncontrollable
compulsion
to
murder
people,
and
they
want
civilly
to
commit
him...
civilly
to
commit
him,
as...
or
a
person
who's
going
to
kill
herself,
or
himself,
uncontrollable
impulse,
though
the
person
otherwise
seems
rational.
we
could
not
civilly
commit
such
a
person?
