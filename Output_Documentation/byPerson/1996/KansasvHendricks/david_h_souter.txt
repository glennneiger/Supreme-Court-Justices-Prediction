justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
necessarily
this
case,
i
take
it,
because
you're
at
least
claiming
that
this
man
is
treatable
to
some
degree.
i
don't
know
how
much,
but
you're
claiming
that
there
is
some
treatability
in
his
condition,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
now...
so
that
in
the
challenge
that
we've
got
before
us
we
would
not,
in
order
to
hold
your
way,
have
to
go
beyond
saying,
i
suppose,
that
this
was
mental
illness
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
as
we
used
it
in
foucha,
because
of
two
things.
number
1,
it
fell
into
at
least
a
recognized
psychiatric
category,
which
gets
us
away
from
a
purely
idiosyncratic
judgment
about
one
individual's
dangerousness,
and
it
is
a
treatable
condition,
and
that's
all
you
would
need
to
win.
am
i
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
far
as
the
mental
illness
category...
yes.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we
could...
if
we
ruled
your
way
we
could
leave
for
another
day
the
question
of
what
to
do
under,
we'll
say,
the
foucha
rule,
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
recognized
psychiatric
category
of
abnormality
but
one
that
was
totally
untreatable,
one
that
was
permanent.
nothing
could
be
done
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
don't
have
to
have
as
broad
a
rule
as
you
were
speaking--
--may
i
clarify
one
thing?
the
court
below
indicated
that
kansas
contemplated
in
the
future
some
kind
of
treatment,
but
wasn't
providing
any.
has
that
changed?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
at
least
for
purposes
of
the
case
that
you've
brought
to
us
it
would
be
sufficient
to
decide
the
case,
i
suppose,
on
the
mental
illness
ground
to
say
that
this
was
a
treatable
condition
and
therefore
qualified
as
mental
illness
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
in
foucha,
and
that
implies
treatability,
i
presume.
and
i
suppose
the
treatability
in
a
way
is
kind
of
a
quid
pro
quo
for
the
capacity
of
the
state
to
lock
somebody
up,
so
that
if
we
went
no
further
than
the
foucha
rule
and
no
further
than
the
rule
that
would
cover
the
case
that
you've
brought
to
us
this
morning,
i
would
suppose
that
a
failure
or
a
refusal
to
treat
would
be
grounds
for
release.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
medically
justified.
do
you
mean
by
that
a
category
which
is
recognized
in
some
standard
medical
literature
like
the
dsm
manual?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
take
the
position
that
the...
or
maybe
you
do,
that
the
legislature
of
any
state
could
say,
we
recognize
a
category
of
mental
abnormality
or
mental
illness.
it
hasn't
been
recognized
in
any
medical
or
psychiatric
literature,
but
we're
recognizing
it
now,
and
that
satisfies
the
rule
that
requires
some
mental
illness
element.
you
wouldn't
say
that
a
state
could
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
function
of
this
medical
recognition
as
you
understand
it
under
foucha?
why
do
we
have
this
element?
why
do
we...
why
would
you
say...
why
do
you
say
that
in
order
to
satisfy
the
mental
illness
element
under
foucha
there
has
got
to
be
a
medically
recognized
category
within
which
the
particular
individual
falls?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
less
likely
to
be
abused
if
there's
a
categorical
approach
rather
than
a
purely
individual
approach.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
