justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
stovall,
can
i
clarify
that
you
are
not
trying
to...
you're
not
suggesting
that
this
court
ought
to
establish
some
kind
of
national
standard
for
what
is
mental
illness
or
mental
abnormality.
haven't
those
definitions
been
left
to
the
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
also
that
there's
no
difference
in
this
man
than
there
was
the
day
he
went
into
prison.
that's
what's
unusual
about
this,
isn't
it?
if
he
is
in
this
category
of
having
a
mental
abnormality,
he's
no
more
or
less
abnormal
at
the
time
he
finishes
his
criminal
sentence
than
he
was
the
day
he
began
to
serve
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
let's
hope
you
do.
and
perhaps
you
could
also
respond
to
how
far
does
this
spread?
could
you
apply
the
same
theory
to,
say,
arsonists?
it
is
something
new
in
the
preventative
detention
line,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
hadn't
a
similar
situation
applied
to
hendricks
at
one
stage?
i
mean,
you
said
everything
that
happened
to
him.
he'd
been
put
in
prison.
he'd
been
put
in
a
mental
institution.
what
was...
was
the
other
incarceration
like
the
one
in
allen?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
a
civil
commitment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
under
this
current
statute
that
was
under
some--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
life
imprisonment
certainly
would
be,
and
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
state
makes
is,
we're
doing
something
gentler
and
kinder
here,
that
instead
of
locking
him
up
in
a
maximum
security
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
we
say
there's
a
criminal
sentence
and
maybe...
there's
not
much
chance
of
it,
but
maybe
he'll
be
all
right
at
the
end
of
the
term.
if
he's
not
at
the
end
of
the
term
we
put
him
in
another
confinement,
form
of
confinement.
why
does
the
constitution
force
the
most
harsh
solution,
i
suppose
is
what
the
state
is
urging?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
weilert,
are
you
complaining
just
about
timing,
and
suppose
mr.
hendricks
is
charged,
indicted,
found
guilty,
and
then
instead
of
having
the
ordinary
criminal
incarceration,
at
that
point
we
have
this
svp
proceeding,
and
so
although
he
has
a
criminal
conviction
he's
never...
the
time
that
he
served
has
been
pursuant
to
this
special
proceeding.
would
there
be
anything
unconstitutional
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
raised...
that...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
that
case
raised
a
procedural
due
process
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
that
they
could
have
done
it
on
the
spot,
but
they
can't
do
it
5
years
later.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
you
agree
with
general
stovall,
don't
you,
that
this
matter
of
what
the
mental
state
is,
subject
to
constitutional
limitations,
is
for
the
state
to
decide,
and
the
state
here
has
defined
something
called
mental
abnormality
that's
short
of
mental
illness?
