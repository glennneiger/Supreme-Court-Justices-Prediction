mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
kansas
is
extending
the
incarceration
of
mr.
hendricks
beyond
the
term
of
sentence
imposed
in
the
plea
agreement
he
reached
with
the
state
of
kansas
in
1984.
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
circumvent
the
constitutional
prohibitions
against
ex
post
facto
and
double
jeopardy
by
calling
for
an
effectively
permanent
incapacitation
that's
imposed,
based
upon
the
commission
of
criminal
acts,
a
civil
commitment
for
treatment.
neither
should
the
strict
limits
of
preventive
detention
outside
of
the
criminal
law
be
broadened
to
allow
such
a
confinement
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
commission
of
a
criminal
offense
at
some
unspecified
point
in
the
future.
to
do
so
would
fundamentally
undermine
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
of
liberty.
we
suggest
that
the
sexually
violent
predator
act
is,
in
fact,
a
criminal
enactment,
even
though
the
legislature
labeled
it
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
i
believe
the
court
upheld
that
they
could
commit
after
a...
pardon
me.
after
a
criminal
sentence
if
they
were
mentally
ill,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
that
is
correct,
however--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
constitutional
standard
for
mental
illness
can
be
the
equivalent
of
any
diagnosis
that
might
come
out
of
the
dsm,
and
that
is
essentially
what
the
state,
i
believe,
is
trying
to
argue.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
pedophilia,
as
i
understand
it,
is
diagnosed
based
upon
prior
commission
of
criminal
acts.
if
pedophilia
was
sufficient
to
form
the
basis
for
a
civil
commitment,
then
any
other
act
such
as
justice
breyer
was
speaking
of...
armed
robbery,
or
any
number
of
other
criminal
acts
which
would
be
the
diagnostic
basis
for
an
antisocial
personality
disorder...
would
also
be
sufficient
to--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--pedophilia
as
opposed
to
any
other
of
the
dsm--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--i
don't
believe
there's
anything
that
i
have
read
which
would
indicate
that
it
is
any
different
than
an
antisocial
personality.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
that
would
be
acceptable
under
the
normal
civil
commitment
statute,
your
honor,
where
the
commitment
is
based
upon
the
inability
of
the
person
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
make
rational
decisions
about
their
treatment,
and
then
because
the
commitment
is
for
the
person's
own
good,
he
can
be
civilly
committed.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
generally,
in--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--because
the
treat...
pardon
me.
the
commitment
of
the
paranoid
schizophrenic
is
for
his
own
good,
to
help
him
to
overcome
his--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--i
don't
believe
that
a
paranoid
schizophrenic
could
be
committed
unless
there
was
first
a
finding
that
the
commitment
would
be
for
his
own
good.
i
believe
commitment
strictly
because
of
the
dangerousness
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
your
honor,
it
is
a
decision
that
the
state
can
make
under
its
criminal...
or,
criminal
powers.
if
the
state
would
choose
to
impose
a
life
sentence
on
a
first-timer
there's
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
that,
but
even
in
this
case
there
are
a
number
of
things
the
state
can
do
other
than
commit
some
person
for
a
second
time
because
of
the
criminal
actions
he's
committed.
they
can
place
very
restrictive
parole
conditions.
they
can
even
enact
some
criminal
legislation
which
would
make
it
illegal
for
someone
with
a
sex
offense
to
have
contact
with
children
in
a
public
place,
go
around
schoolyards,
and
enforce
that
criminally.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
the
restrictions
that
i
spoke
of
as
far
as
parole
or
conditional
release
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--it's
a
restriction
of
his
liberty,
but
it's
not
a
confinement
that
is
a
massive
curtailment
of
that
liberty,
and
i
believe
that's
the
distinction,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
the
constitution
does
not
force
that,
the
most
harsh
remedy.
the
state
of
kansas
at
the
time
of
mr.
hendricks'
commission
of
these
acts
in
1984
had
a
procedure,
and
still
does
have
a
procedure
where
he
could
be
psychologically
evaluated
and
committed
for
care,
if
that
was
in
fact
necessitated
or
recommended
by
that
evaluation.
the
only
limitation
on
that
term
of
care
and
treatment,
if
needed,
would
be
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
have
been
imposed
by
the
criminal
act,
or
on
the
criminal
acts,
which
in
this
case
in
1984
was
45
to
180
years.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
i
believe
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--i
believe
that
is
a
very
astute
observation,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
it
is
certainly
the...
or,
pardon
me,
an
avenue
open
to
the
state
to
do
it
that
way.
it's
not
necessarily
required,
though,
because
the
state
could
provide
for
an
indeterminate
sentence,
also,
which
would
be
dependent
upon
the
person
then
proving
to
the
parole
authorities
that
he
was
safe
to
be
at
large.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
well,
certainly
the
parole
authorities
would
have
to
have
some
discretion,
but
it
would
be...
it
would
not
be
manipulative
in
the
same
way
that
the
states
could
formulate
a
plan
to
commit
persons
based
solely
upon
dangerousness,
which
we
believe
this
act
provides
that
opportunity.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
it
is...
in
addington
v.
texas
the
court
basically
said
the
commitment
is
for
those
who
cannot
take
care
of
themselves,
and
that
is
where
the
being
in
the
best
interests
of
the
person
comes
from.
the
court--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
anyone
has
a
constitutional
right
to
commit
a
crime.
however--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--it
would
not
require
the
commission
of
a
crime
to
be
committed
civilly,
but
it
would
require
the
finding
of
a
mental
disease
or
mental
illness
and
the
finding
of
dangerousness
both
by--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--i
believe
that
that
is
the
underlying
basis
for
civil
commitment.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
it
does
say
that
it
is
dangerous
to
himself
or
others,
and
that
is
in
conjunction
with
the
need
that...
or,
pardon
me,
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
he
is
unable
to
care
for
himself
and
needs
commitment.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
while
addington
was
a
procedural
due
process
case,
i
believe
the
concept
that
a
civil
commitment
has
to
be
based
upon
dangerousness
and
mental
illness
was
carried
into
fruition
by
this
court
in
foucha
v.
louisiana.
we
would
suggest
that
the
primary
reason
for
the
kansas
statute
having
been
passed
was
to
continue
the
incarceration
of
persons
who
were
being
released
from
confinement
following
their
conviction
and
sentence
on
sexual
offenses.
that
finding
was
made
by
the
kansas
supreme
court,
where
it
said
that
the
primary
objective
was
to
continue
incarceration
and
that
treatment
was
incidental
at
best.
that's
further--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--that's
the
situation
in
colorado
v.
specht,
or
specht
v.
colorado,
where
the
court
approved
that
type
of
situation,
where
instead
of
a
specific
term
of
criminal
incarceration
it
allowed
for
an
indeterminate
term
and
found
that
it
was,
in
fact,
a
criminal
incarceration
even
though
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
incapacitation
rather
than
retribution.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
that
was
a
procedural
claim,
your
honor,
where
there
was
not
a
hearing
for
that
second
sentencing
procedure,
but
that
would
be
an
appropriate
type...
kansas
could
make
the
decision
at
the
time
of
the
original
conviction
to
go
to
a
sexual
psychopath
type
law,
much
as
it
could
have
done
back
in
1984
when
kansas
did
have
such
a
law
in
effect.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--it's
now
12
years
later,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
they
can't
do
it
now
is
because
first
of
all
it
is
a
continue...
a
second
incarceration
for
the
same
conviction,
the
same
criminal
act
that
he
committed
back
in
1984.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
there
could
have
been
a
civil,
or
a
commitment
for
treatment
done
in
1984,
yes,
if
there
had
been
a...
if
there
had
not
been
a
criminal
sentence
imposed
at
that
time.
in
the
kansas
supreme
court's
decision,
it
went
on,
after
saying
that
the
main
purpose
of
the
incarceration,
or
the...
yes,
the
incarceration
was
for
punishment
and
not
for
treatment,
it--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--pardon
me,
for
incapacitation
rather
than
treatment.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
and
incapacitation
has
been
recognized
by
the
court
as
one
of
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--the
record
reflects
that
the
kansas
supreme
court
made
that
finding
based
upon
the
evidence
presented
both
at
the
trial
court
and
the
habeas
court,
where
the
head
of
the
treatment
facility
said
that
the
persons
there
were
receiving
essentially
no
treatment
other
than--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--today,
it's
my
understanding
there
is
some
group
therapy
being
given.
there...
i
don't
believe
there's
any
indication
on
the
record
that
such
therapy
is
effective
or
has
any
hope
of
being
effective
to
overcome
the
condition
of
pedophilia,
primarily
because,
as
the
state's
expert
testified,
pedophilia
is
a
diagnosis
that,
once
made,
remains
with
the
person
forever.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
there
is
certainly
no--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--there's
certainly
no
doubt
that
mr.
hendricks
presents
a
risk
of
committing
further
crimes
if
released.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
to
children.
that
is
what
his
previous
crimes
have
been,
yes.
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
can
incarcerate
people
solely
because
they
have
the
possibility
of
committing
a
criminal
act
at
some
point
in
the
future.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
no,
chief...
mr.
chief
justice.
the
state
has
other
opportunities,
or,
pardon
me,
other
means
available
to
it.
it
can,
you
know,
impose
very
stringent
conditions
of
parole,
have
him
repeat...
pardon
me,
report
very
frequently,
require
him
to
stay
away
from
children,
require
him
to
stay
away
from
schoolyards.
it
can,
for
people
who
have
not
yet
been
convicted,
of
course,
do
all
sorts
of
things
with
the
sentencing
guidelines.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
i
believe
a
total
of
five,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
that
is
correct,
and...
but
the
state
still
has
the
ability
to
put
restrictions
on
that
person
to
lesson
the
risk.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
your
honor,
the
only
way
to
be
totally
effective
would
be
to
lock
up
anyone
who
would
possibly
commit
a
criminal
action
in
the
future.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
in
order
to
do
that,
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
be
talking
about
a
preventive
detention--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
as
a
part
of
the
parole
conditions
after
being
released
from
incarceration.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
if...
pardon
me,
your
honor.
the
commitment
could
not
occur
simply
because
someone
has
been
indicted,
i
believe,
unless
there
was
a
showing
that
the
person
was
mentally
ill.
in
allen
v.
illinois
the
court
found
that
the...
that
mr.
allen
was
mentally
ill.
i
believe
he
had
schizophrenia.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
magic
to
the
term
mentally
ill,
but
there
is
a
point,
i
believe,
at
which
the
state
cannot
commit
someone
simply
because
they
have
a
history
of
prior
commitment,
or
criminal
act,
and
based
upon
those
prior
commitments
is,
they're
predicted
to
commit
another
criminal
act
in
the
future.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
i
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia
and
justice
breyer.
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--in
that
circumstance,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
civil
commitment
might
be
appropriate
because
it
would
be
for
the
good
of
the
person
being
committed
to
prevent
him
from
killing
himself
and
for
the
protection
of
society,
but
it
would
be
based
upon
the
original
finding
that
the
civil
commitment
had
to
be
based
upon
a
mental
illness
rather
than
simply
the
prior
commission
of
a
crime.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
i
believe
that
the
state
has
latitude
in
deciding
whatever
the
condition
is
for
civil
commitment
so
long
as
it
is
something
more
than
just
a
condition
based
upon
the
prior
commission
of
crime
and
the
risk
of
commission
of
crime
again
in
the
future.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
i...
if
i
stated
that
i
did
not
mean
to
do
so.
i
believe
that
danger--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--i
believe
that's
correct,
because--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--because
the
person
is
unable
to
care
for
themselves.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
if
we
do
not
limit
it
to
that,
i
believe
we
then...
there's
no
logical
stopping
place
where
we
can
say
that
a
commitment
for
dangerousness
alone
would
not
be
sufficient,
and--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--well,
as
i
understand
the
ali
definition--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--based
on
that
alone?
i--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--your
honor,
i
believe
we
would
be
treading
on
very
thin
ice,
because
that
in
effect
is
allowing
for
a
commitment
based
upon
what
someone
might
do
in
the
future,
and
it
would
have
to
be
based
upon
a
finding
of
mental
illness,
which
we
once
again
come
back
to
that
has
to
be
based
upon
something
more
than
the
commission
of
the
crime
in
the
past
and
the
possibility
of
committing
a
crime
in
the
future.
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
your
honor,
in
allen
the
commitment
there
was
in
lieu
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
here,
the
state
has
already
had
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
in
allen
the
justification
the
court
gave
was
that
it
disavowed...
allen...
or,
pardon
me,
illinois
disavowed
any
interest
in
punishment
in
lieu
of
the
civil
commitment.
in
this
case,
the
same
procedure
could
have
perhaps
been
used,
except
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--yes,
your
honor,
it
should.
the
commitment
in
allen
was
of
a
person
who
was...
had
a
treatable
mental
illness,
a
schizophrenic.
in
this
case
there's
no--
mr.
thomas
j.
weilert
--but
in
allen
the...
this...
the
distinction
was
that
it
disavowed
punishment.
in
this
case,
the
state
does
not.
it
was
for
treatment.
in
this
case
there's
no
treatment,
and
that
would
conclude.
thank
you.
