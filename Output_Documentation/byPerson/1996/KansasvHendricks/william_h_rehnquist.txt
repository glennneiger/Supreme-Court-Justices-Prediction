general
stovall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
stovall,
don't
you
think
in
using
those
terms
in
our
opinions
we
are
certainly
lay
people
from
a
medical
point
of
view,
and
they
probably
are
not
used
in
any
strict
medical
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
define
reasonable
doubt
in
criminal
cases
in
terms
of
15
percent,
or
12
percent.
we've
never
required
that
sort
of
precision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
stovall,
will
you
be
devoting
some
of
your
oral
argument
to
a
response
to
the
cross-petitioner's
claims?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead
and
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
stovall.
mr.
weilert.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas,
mr.
weilert,
in
its
opinion,
which
upheld
your...
the
majority
upheld
your
point
of
view,
said
the
state
could
get
around...
could
handle
it
by
simply
imposing
a
life
sentence
on
these
people
and
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem.
does
that
really
solve
any
problem
to
say
that
the
state
can't
do
what
it
does
here
but
it
can
come
back
and
impose
a
life
sentence
on
a
person
for
the
first
pedophilic
offense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely
that
would
be
manipulable,
too,
if
that
is
to
be
part
of
the
test,
if
the
parole
authorities
are
to
have
that
sort
of
discretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
thought
addington
said
dangerous
to
others,
didn't
it,
as
well
as
dangerous
to
himself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
addington
was
just
talking
about
the
burden
of
proof
when
you're
going
ahead
with
civil
commitment.
it
didn't
purport
to
categorize
every
single
situation
which
would
justify
a
civil
commitment,
if
you
met
the
burden
of
proof.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what's
the
state
supposed
to
do,
just
wait
till
he
goes
out
and
does
it
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
justice
breyer's
example
of
someone
who's
said
by
every
psychiatrist
who
has
seen
him,
if
he's
at
large
he's
going
to
murder
people?
now,
do
you
say
that
person
can
or
cannot
be
civilly
committed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
ali.
i'm
just
asking,
all
the
psychiatrists
find
a
person
is
going
to...
if
he's
at
large
he's
going
to
murder
people.
now,
can
that
person
be
civilly
committed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
that
it's
a
form
of
mental
illness,
as
one
would
hope
they
would
find.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weilert.
the
case
is
submitted.
