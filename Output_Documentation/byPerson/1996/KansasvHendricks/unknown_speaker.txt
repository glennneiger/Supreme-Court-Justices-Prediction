secondly,
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
where,
if...
even
though
this
act
is
purported
to
be
civil,
it's
in
fact
criminal,
because
the
intent
and
purpose
and
effect
of
the
legislation
is
criminal,
and
i
would
suggest
that
even
back
in
1984,
if
the
only
thing
that
the
state
had
to
prove
was
a
mental
abnormality,
that
there
would
be
some
question
about
whether
the
commitment
could
have
occurred
at
that
time,
rather
than
proving
a
mental
illness
which
could
be
treated.
so
you're
modifying
the
answer
that
you
first
gave.
you're
not
so
sure
that
it
could
have
been
done
immediately
after
the
conviction.
