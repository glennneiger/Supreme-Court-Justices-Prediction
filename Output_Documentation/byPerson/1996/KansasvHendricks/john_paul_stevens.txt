justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this
statute
and
what
the
state's
position
is?
the
statute
defines
a
sexually
violent
predator
as
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
or
charged
with
a
sexually
violent
offense
and
who
suffers
from
a
mental
abnormality
or
personality
disorder
which
makes
the
person
likely
to
engage
in
predatory
acts
of
sexual
violence.
would
this
statute
be
constitutional,
in
your
view,
if
it
left
out
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
prior
conviction,
if
it
were
like
the
illinois
statute
on
which
you
rely?
just,
they
come
in
with
an
indictment
of
this
and
say,
in
addition
we
think
he's
likely
to
do
it
in
the
future.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really
the
prior
convictions
are
merely
the
evidentiary
support
under
the
statute
for
the
finding
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
this
person
will
be
violent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
not?
that's
what
puzzles
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
those
who
have
previously
been
punished,
or
ones
who
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
i
don't
understand
why
a
person
who's
indicted
on
very
strong
evidence,
probable
cause,
shouldn't
be
subjected
to
exactly
the
same
treatment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
agree
that
it
is
a
preponderance
standard
that's
determinative
here.
it
has
to
be
more
likely
than
not
than
the
person
will
engage
in
this
kind
of
conduct
in
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
proving
that
he's
likely
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
boils
down
to
a
preponderance
standard,
of
course.
do
you
agree
that,
at
least
under
the
law
as
it
exists
this
morning,
if
you
were
providing
no
treatment
at
all,
and
that
could
be
shown,
that
an
individual
would
be
entitled
to
release
on
habeas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say--
--may
i
just
ask,
then
why
isn't
this
case
covered
by
addington
v.
texas,
where
you
require
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
you
only
require
more
likely
than
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
see,
you
don't
provide
that.
you
just
say
it
has
to
be
likely
that
it'll
do
this.
it's
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it'll
be
likely,
but
it's
really
a
preponderance
standard,
which
is
not...
doesn't
comply
with
addington.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
fact
that
likely
do
the...
commit
the
harm
to
the...
to
children.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
a
key
element
doesn't
require
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
key
element
of
the
definition
just
requires
that
they
be
likely
to
do
it.
that's
a
preponderance
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
prove
that
it's
likely
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
that's...
you
can't...
you
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
still
51
percent.
when
you
speak
of
a...
i
think
you
spoke
of
a
medically...
you
didn't
use
the
word
medically
recognized
category.
what
was
the
term
you
used?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
what
the
opinion
says,
if
you
read
it
carefully.
[laughter]
but
the
kansas...
your
state
courts
have
not
construed
the
standard
to
be
a
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
standard
in
the
classic
sense,
has
it?
in
other
words,
we
could
say...
the
court
could
say,
look,
proving
likelihood
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
really
means
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
will
do
thus
and
so,
but
that
isn't
what
your
courts
have
said,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
statute
is
dealing
with
the
problem
presented
by
someone
who's
served
his
sentence
entirely,
and
the
criminal
punishment,
power
to
punish
him
criminally
has
been
exhausted.
there's
still
a
threat
there,
and
i
frankly
don't
see
the
difference
between
that
case
and
one
where
you
just
indict
somebody
who's
been
caught
but
never
convicted,
and
the
question
is,
can
you
do
those
other
things
to
that
person
without
some
kind
of
proof
of
a
mental
abnormality
by
some
standard?
i
don't
think
the
difference
between
going
to
jail
and
being
subjected
to
a
lot
of
other
restraints
can
just
answer
this
case,
because
the
basic
question
in
the
case
is
what
is
the
threshold
showing
that
must
be
made
to
treat
such
a
person,
or
take
him
out
of
society,
other
than
as
punishment
for
a
crime?
and
i
think
we're
all
assuming
that
this
is
not...
i
mean,
that
the
punishment
for
a
crime
has
already
been
done,
and
i
don't...
as
i
say,
i
don't
see
why
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
person's
been
punished
or
hasn't...
or
has
just
been
indicted.
frankly,
i
don't
see
the
constitutional
distinction
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what's
the
magic
to
the
term
mentally
ill?
why
can't
they
call
it
having
xyz
personality
factor,
and
they
can
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
person
with
that
factor
in
all
probability,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
beyond
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
will
do
bad
things,
rob
banks,
hurt
children?
why
isn't
that
enough,
if
the
xyz
factor
is
something
to
do
with
the
person's
character,
whether
you
call
it
mentally
illness
or
not?
i
don't
quite
understand
the
magic
to
the
term,
mentally
ill.
