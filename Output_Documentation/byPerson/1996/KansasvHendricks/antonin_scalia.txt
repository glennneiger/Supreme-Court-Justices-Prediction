justice
antonin
scalia
is
8
percent
high
enough?
i
mean,
what
if
the
state
says,
you
know,
8
percent
is
still
too
high
a
risk?
at
what
percentage
of
unlikelihood
to
commit
more
of
these
offenses
does
the
state
release
these
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
tell
the
jury,
you
know?
is
there
no
chance
that
this
individual
will
commit
acts
of
these...
of
this
sort
again
if
he's
released,
or
is
there
an
8-percent
chance,
or
a...
what
do
you
tell
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
likely.
what
was
that,
49
percent
would
not
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
pretty
generous.
if
it's,
you
know,
51-49
that
he'll
continue
to
do
this
you
let
him
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
if
it's
clear
that
treatment
will
not
be
effective?
what
if
the
convicted
defendant
puts
on
psychiatric
testimony
that
says,
you
know,
you
can
talk
about
treating
this
all
you
like,
but
there's
no
effective
treatment?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
when
treatment
is
ineffective.
you
generously
provide
for
treatment
when
there's
no
reason
to
think
the
treatment's
going
to
do
any
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
particular
person.
suppose
the
evidence
is
clear
that,
yes,
he
will
do
it
again
if
he's
released,
but
treatment
is
not
going
to
help
that
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
court--
--because
you're
providing
for
a
treatment
that
is
not
going
to
do
any
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand
your
position
we
can
commit
him,
treatment
or
not,
just
because
he's
dangerous,
you
know,
and
we
can
commit
him
and
not
even
provide
any
treatment.
i
can
understand
that.
but
i
can't
understand
the
position
that
we
can
only
commit
him
if
we
provide
treatment,
even
though
it's
entirely
clear
that
treatment
will
do
entirely
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
medically
recognized
condition
that
has
been
medically
determined
to
be
nontreatable?
is
there
any
such
thing
as
a
medically
recognized
condition
which
the
medical
profession
is
willing
to
say
is
nontreatable?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
we
mean
by
dangerousness
in
that
case?
might
not
we
have
meant
by
dangerousness
simply
the
same
thing
that's
the
test
here,
that
he's
likely
to
harm
somebody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
would
have
converted
that
into
a
preponderance
standard
as
well,
if
you
follow
that
reasoning.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
all
that
okay?
i
don't
understand.
i
mean,
if
the
principle
you're
arguing
for
is
correct,
why
aren't
those
restrictions
just
as
improper?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
restriction
of
his
physical
liberty.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
state
has
to
take
the
harsher
course
because
the
harsher
course
is
the
only
one
that
is
less
manipulable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
isn't
there
some
fear
about...
you
know,
totalitarian
regimes
don't
put
people
in
jail
for
crimes.
they
commit
them
for
mental
treatment.
it's
a
very
hard
thing
to
nail
down,
isn't
it,
who's
mentally
ill
and
who's
finally
been
cured.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
mainly
to...
perhaps
to
protect
against
that,
the
state,
if
it
wants
to
protect
itself,
has
to
take
the
harsher
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
no,
we're
talking--
--mr.
weilert,
i
assume
that
many...
i
don't
know
what
the
statistics
are,
but
within
a
certain
age
group
the
recidivism
rate
for
anybody
released
from
prison
may
be
as
high
as
80
percent,
so
you
could
say
for
everybody
walking
out
of
prison
he's
likely
to
commit
the
same
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
case?
i
guess
we
could--
--and
maybe
we
could
preventively
detain
everybody
that's
released
because
he's
committed
one
crime
and
is
likely
to
commit
another
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
being
facetious,
mr.
weilert.
[laughter]
i'm
puzzled
about
your
response
to
justice
o'connor.
you
said
that
they
could
put
all
these
other
restraints
on
the
individual.
on
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
somebody's
likely
to
commit
a
rime,
can
you
put
all
these
restraints
on
people,
they
can't
go
near
schoolyards,
and
so
forth,
or
are
you
talking
about
as
part
of
a
sentence
after
being
convicted
of
a
crime?
