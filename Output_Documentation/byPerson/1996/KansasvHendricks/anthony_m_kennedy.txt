justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
that
even
the
dsm
says
that
these
categories
have
no
real
operational
consistency,
and
that
you
look
to
the
diagnosis
or
the
prognosis
on
a
case-by-case
basis
after
clinical
evaluation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
begin
by
saying,
and
this
was
part
of
justice
o'connor's
line
of
questioning,
too,
that
this
is
a
hybrid
between
a
criminal
statute
and
a
civil
statute.
i
should
think,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes,
and
i
was
going
to
say
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
in
your
brief
at
least
is
one
in
which
you
can
justify
this
statute
strictly
as
a
civil
commitment.
if
your
statutory
scheme
were
changed
somewhat
and
you
had
an
adequate
prognosis
of
dangerous
sexual
behavior,
civil
commitment
could
follow
under
your
argument,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i--
--do
you
have
some
studies
that
we
could
refer
to
to
support
that?
my
impression
was
that
the
psychiatrists
cannot
really,
or
clinicians,
certify
the
patient
as
being
unlikely
to
repeat
unless
they
observe
him
in
a
normal
environment,
and
he's
not
in
a
normal
environment
when
he's
in
prison,
so
it's
just
somewhat
circular.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
general
stovall--
--i
thought...
maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
the
dsm
was
that
this
is
not
a
cognitive
disorder.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean...
you
know,
correct
me
if
that's
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
cognitive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
well,
i
suppose
the
quid
pro
quo
for
locking
him
up,
or
the
reason
for
locking
him
up
is
that
he's
a
danger
to
others,
and
that
treatability
bears
on
the
fairness
of
the
conditions
of
his
confinement.
that
is
to
say,
it
is
thought
that
it
is
unfair
to
confine
him
without
treatment
if
there's
any
likelihood
of
success.
is
that
the
underlying
rationale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
general
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--could
you
address
the
cross-petition
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
disagree
with
you.
suppose
we
think
that
the
burden
of
proof
that
you
impose
is
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
then
don't
you
lose
the
case
under
our
previous
precedents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
both.
it
looks
like
both.
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
had
a
paranoid
schizophrenia
acute
type,
and
the
diagnosis
was
that
the
person
was
dangerous
to
himself
and
to
others,
could
you
commit
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
rationality
is
not
a
part
of
the
civil
commitment
preconditions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
that
you
can
commit
the
paranoid
schizophrenic
and
not
this
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
the
condition,
the
condition
for
his
incarceration
was
he
was
dangerous
to
others?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the...
your
best
authority
from
this
court
for
the
proposition
that
you
can
only
have
a
civil
commitment
for
the
best
interests
of
the
person
and
not
for
the
safety
of
society?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
rationale...
if
that
is
the
correct
reading
of
addington,
what
is
the
explanation
for
it,
that
everyone
has
a
constitutional
right
to
commit
a
crime
once
before
he
can
be
committed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
before
he
can
be
committed
civilly.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
you
say
he
can
only
be
committed
if
it's
for
his
own
good,
if
we're
talking
about
civil
commitment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
the
ethical
calculus
that
makes
the
dangerousness
to
oneself
so
much
of
a
higher
order
of
priority
than
dangerous
to
10
other
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
that's
the
logical
consequence
of
your
answer
that
you
must
find
that
it's
in
the
person's
own
welfare,
and
i
suppose
we
could
say
it's
in
your
own
welfare
to
prevent
you
from
committing
crimes,
but
leaving
that
aside,
you
seem
to
say
it
must
be
in
the
patient's
own
welfare
to
be
committed
before
there
can
be
a
civil
commitment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
you
why
that
is
so.
why
is
that
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what's
the
reason
for--
--why
limit
it
to
that?
