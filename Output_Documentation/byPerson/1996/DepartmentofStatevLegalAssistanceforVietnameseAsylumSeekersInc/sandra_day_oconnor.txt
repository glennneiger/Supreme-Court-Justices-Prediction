mr.
kneedler,
in
the
proceedings
below,
as
i
understand
the
record,
the
government
argued
that
there
was
discrimination
against
vietnamese
nationals
but
it
could
be
justified
on
a
rational
basis,
and
as
i
understand
the
argument
made
by
the
government
now
is,
there
was
no
discrimination
at
all.
and
on
a
secondary
point,
i
think
the
record
discloses
that
in
the
courts
below
the
government
did
not
argue
that
the
language
of
the
statute
referring
to
issuance
of
a
visa
did
not
include
accepting
a
visa
application.
were
either
of
these
arguments
raised
by
the
government
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
discrimination
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
the
government
now
urges
us
to
vacate
and
remand
because
of
the
very
recent
amendment
to
section
1152(a)(1).
does
that
recent
amendment
cover
all
of
the
respondent's
claims?
didn't
they
make
constitution--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--constitutional
arguments
and
other
things
that
haven't
been
addressed
by
the
court
and
that
might
not
be
covered
by--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
respondents
have
come
back
and
said,
oh,
but
we
also
want
reparative
injunctive
relief
looking
to
the
past.
do
you
know
what
that's
all
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
my
point
was
not
that,
but
rather
that
the
statute
applies
prospectively
and
would
govern
the
issuance
of
prospective
relief.
