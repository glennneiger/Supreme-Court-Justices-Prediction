that
has
been
asked
for,
or
that
has
been
received?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
requested.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
we--
--saying
that
the
hong
kong
government
has
agreed
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
stay
of
what?
it
certainly
wasn't
a
stay
of
hong
kong's
deportation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
our
writ
doesn't
run
that
far
yet,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
be
the
possible
conceivable
meaning
of
the
congress'
provision
that
the
new
statute
applies
to
all
cases
filed
after
a
certain
date?
isn't
that
the
way
the
provision
in
the
new
law
is
worded?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
what
cases
the
new
law
applies
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's
an
effective
date
provision
for
the
legislation
too,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
does
that
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
this
one
read?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
thought
that
it
had
said
all
cases
filed
after
a
certain
date,
in
which
case
your
argument
wouldn't
make
any
sense,
because
that
obviously
means,
regardless
of
what
the
situation
might
have
been
on
the
facts,
if
your
case
is
filed
after
a
certain
date,
the
new
law
applies.
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
order
to
tell
whether
there's
been
discrimination,
don't
you
have
to
first
determine
whether
the
two
people
are
similarly
situated?
doesn't
that
determination
go
into...
necessarily
go
into
the
question
of
discrimination
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
certainly
encourage
more
people
to
come
out
if
they
know
once
they
get
in
hong
kong,
where
they
have
safe
refuge,
they
can
apply
for
a
visa
to
the
united
states
from
there.
i
thought
that's
the
purpose
of
the
state
department's
policy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
discourage
people
from
coming
out.
