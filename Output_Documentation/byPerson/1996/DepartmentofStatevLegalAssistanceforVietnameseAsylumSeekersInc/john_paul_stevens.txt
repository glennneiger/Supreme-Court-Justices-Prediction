justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question,
mr.
kneedler,
is
it
still
the
government's
primary
submission,
though,
that
we
should
simply
gbr
at
this
time,
rather
than
addressing
these
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
the
language
because
your
basic
position
is,
as
i
understood
the
briefs
correctly,
is
that
1152(a)(1)
should
be
construed
as
a
limitation
on
the
authority
of
the
secretary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
as
amended
it
says,
nothing
in
this
paragraph
shall
be
construed
to
limit
the
authority
of
the
secretary,
so
forth
and
so
on.
so
if
we
were
to
decide
the
case,
your
basic
submission,
we
would
either
have
to
say
that
something
in
1152(a)(1)
limits
the
authority
of
the
secretary,
or
it
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you're
still
asking
us
to
construe
a
statute
in
a
way
directly
contrary
to
the
way
congress
has
told
us
we
should
construe
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say...
there's
no
time
limit.
it
just
talks
about
people
who
are
going
to
construe
this
statute,
and
you're
asking
us
to
construe
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
cite
roadway
express
in
your
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
supplemental
brief.
mr.
wolf,
two
things
occur
to
me.
one
is
the
point
you've
just
been
discussing
with
justice
ginsburg,
which
is
that
conceivably
the
amendment
by
congress
should
assist
the
courts
in
determining
the
meaning
of
the
statute
as
it
was
originally
enacted.
that
is
possible.
secondly,
what
the
respondents
are
seeking
ultimately
is
issuance
of
visas.
now,
that
hasn't
occurred
as
yet,
and
if
the
court
were
to
order
the
department
of
state
to
issue
visas,
that
relief
is
prospective,
and
as
i
understand
it,
we
have
held
that
an
amendment
like
this
would
apply
to
the
issuance
of
that
prospective
relief.
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
to
avoid
that
by
trying
to
look
backwards
and
say,
well,
the
statute
meant
something
else
at
the
time.
the
relief,
nonetheless,
is
prospective,
and
would
appear
to
be
governed
by
the
new
provisions
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
a
factual
question?
perhaps
i
should
know
this,
but
supposing
there
were
a
vietnamese
who
had
been
a
long-time
resident
of
hong
kong,
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
boat
people,
could
he
be...
could
he
apply
for
a
visa
in
hong
kong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
say
he's
lived
there
for
the
last
20
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
a
boat...
i
say,
a
vietnamese.
if
that's
true,
then
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
discrimination
is
on
the
basis
of
nationality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
assuming
the
french
person
is
also...
came
as
a...
was
one
of
these
migrants
on
the...
in
this...
one
of
the
boat
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
whether
he
comes
within
the
terms
of
the
cpa
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
classifica...
the
class
does
not
include
all
vietnamese.
it
includes
a
subcategory
of
vietnamese
who
fit
into
the
cpa
category.
