mr.
daniel
wolf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
issues
that
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
affirmance
in
order
to...
in
favor
of
respondents
in
order
to
affirm
this
case.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
statute,
section
1152(a)(1),
was
violated
by
the
department's
policy
when
that
policy
was
in
existence
and
before
the
new
statute
came
along.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
change
instituted
on
september
30,
1996
deprives
respondents
of
the
right
to
relief.
mr.
daniel
wolf
well,
the
relief
that
we
would
suggest,
justice
souter,
is
relief...
reparative
relief,
relief
that
could,
insofar
as
is
possible,
restore
plaintiffs
to
the
position
that
they
would
have
been
in
were
it
not
for
the
department's
illegal
conduct.
so
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
somebody
who
had
been--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--if
the
statute
was
intended
to
be
retroactive,
that
relief
would
be
impossible,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
indicating
any
retroactive
intent,
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
landgraf,
a
new
law
cannot
be
applied
retroactively
to
conduct
predating
its
enactment
if
that
conduct
was
illegal,
so
the
new
law
cannot
reach
back
and
render
lawful
conduct
that
was
unlawful
at
the
time
that
conduct
was...
took
place,
and
certainly
we
are...
respondents
are
entitled
to
relief
that
would
remedy
the
effects
of
the
illegal
conduct.
mr.
daniel
wolf
mr.
chief
justice,
first
just
to
clarify
the
type
of
relief
that
we're
seeking,
we're
seeking
an
order
mandating
the
processing
and
the
expeditious
processing
in
hong
kong
of
our
clients'
visa
applications,
not
an
order
that
would
have
anything
to
do
with
enforceable
repatriation,
per
se.
mr.
daniel
wolf
well,
certainly,
were
the
statute
to
be
one
that
prohibited
this
court
from
issuing
an
injunction
or
from
granting
the...
granting
respondents
the
relief
they're
seeking,
then
that
would
be
correct,
but
the
situation
here
is
that
respondents
had
a
substantive
right
to
be...
to
not
be
discriminated
against--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
we
had...
at
the
time
we
had
an
expectation,
a
reasonable
expectation
that
we
would
not
be
discriminated
against
in
the
issuance
of
a
visa.
under
landsgraf,
the
new
statute
cannot
reach
back
and
make
determinations--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--the
principle
of
nonretroact...
of
the
principle
concerning
retroactivity
applies,
as
i
understand
it,
regardless
of
the
type
of
relief
that's
being
sought.
the
point
is,
is
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
remedy
the
past
effects
of
the
illegal
conduct,
so
there's
nothing
to
prevent
this
court
from
restoring
respondents
to
the
situation
they
would
have
been
in
were
it
not
for
the
illegal
conduct.
mr.
daniel
wolf
justice
souter,
that's
correct
if
the
statute
were
to
be
applied
retroactively.
mr.
daniel
wolf
but
mr.--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
i
would
say
that
there
are
two
reasons
in
this
particular
case.
the
first
reason
is
a
concern
regarding
forcible
repatriation.
the
department
has
received
certain
representations
from
the
hong
kong
government
that
lapsed
on
january
31,
1997.
given
the
proceedings
in
this
case
and
the
pace
that
it
has
gone
at,
we
can't
be
confident
that
on
remand
we
would
be
able
to
get
relief
after
the
appellate
process
and
so
on
before
the
lapse
of
that
time.
the
processing
itself
takes
several
weeks.
mr.
daniel
wolf
well,
it's
uncertain
how
the
d.c.
circuit
would
handle
this
case.
they
may
send
it
first
back
to
the
district
court,
in
which
case
we
would
have
to
have
proceedings
before
the
district
court,
come
back
up--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
that
gets
me
to
the
next
point
about
why
a
remand
would
be
inappropriate
in
this
case,
and
that
is
is
that
nothing
about
the
change
in
statute
alters
the
fact
that
the
department's
conduct
was
illegal
at
the
time
that
conduct
took
place.
respondents
should
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
d.c.
circuit
and
relitigate
that
issue
on
remand.
a
much
more
appropriate
disposition
in
this
case--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--the
d.c.
circuit
was
poised
to
litigate
it--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
for
the
same
reasons,
justice
ginsburg,
that
it
may
be
improvident
for
this
court
to
retain
the
certiorari
petition
as
we
indicated
in
our
supplemental
brief,
it
may
also
be
improvident
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
en
banc
to
retain...
to
consider
this
case
yet
again
on
all
of
the
issues--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--it
was
a
signal
that
the
court
viewed
it
as
a
serious
question,
as
this
court's
granting
of
certiorari
is
such
a
signal,
but
for
the
same
reason
that
this
court
might
want
to
relinquish
this
case,
the
d.c.
circuit
en
banc
could
do
well
the
same.
at
any--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
we
were
not
clear,
based
on
that
statement
about
whether
or
not
the
representation
would
include
representations
made
on...
would
include
the
situation
on
remand.
we
spoke
with
government
counsel
to
ask
whether
they
would
make
further...
get
further
representations
from
the
hong
kong
government.
we
were
left
certainly
with
the
clear
impression
that
that
was
not
going
to
happen,
and--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
as
i
indicated,
justice
ginsburg,
we
believed
there
to
be
some
ambiguity,
significant
ambiguity
in
that
statement.
we
checked
with
the
government.
apparently
they
believed
there
to
be
enough
ambiguity
to
go
back
to
the
hong
kong
government,
which
they
never
told
us
they
were
going
to
do,
and
that
ended
up
being
the
situation
as
it
exists
today.
mr.
daniel
wolf
i
did
not
understand
it
at
the
time
to
be
ambiguous.
if
it
indicate...
if
it
was
ambiguous,
i
regret
that
i...
that
we
put
it
in
those
terms,
but
at
the
time
i
did
not
see
there
to
be
any
ambiguity.
as
i
understood
the
representation--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--as
i
said,
as
i
understood
the
representations
at
the
time,
they
only
applied
to
the
supreme
court
proceedings
and
the
appellates
court
in
lisa
le,
and
if
it
may
have
been
my
misunderstanding,
i
would
apologize
for
that.
the
department's...
this
court
certainly
has
the
power
to
remedy
the
past
illegal
conduct,
and
there's
nothing
in
section
1152(a)(1)
which
deprives
respondents
of
a
remedy
in
this
case,
and
therefore,
if
a
violation
occurred
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
law,
then
this
court
certainly
could
offer
respondents,
or
the
lower
courts
could
certainly
give
respondents
the
relief
that
they
are
seeking,
and
the
rule
is
no
different
in
the
case
of
an
interpretive
statute,
or
statute--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--perhaps
not,
but
in
this
particular
case,
taking
your
hypothetical,
if
the
person
had
applied
for
pension
benefits
in
'94,
been
denied
on
illegal
grounds
in
'94,
and
then
in
'96
the
law
changed,
the
individual
would
still
be
entitled
to
receive
the
pension
benefits
for
'94,
or
injunctive
order
granting
the
benefits.
mr.
daniel
wolf
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
daniel
wolf
the
new
law
states
what
it
states.
it's
a
one
sentence
provision
saying
nothing
in
section
1152...
it's
nothing
in
the
former
paragraph,
meaning
1152(a)(1),
shall
be
interpreted
as
limiting
the
authority--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--there
is
an
effective
date
provision,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
wolf
there
are
various
different
effective
date
provisions.
there
are
12
provisions
that
are
specifically
retroactive.
this
is
not
one
of
them.
mr.
daniel
wolf
i'm
not
sure,
justice
scalia,
whether
there's
a...
we
checked,
and
i
didn't
recall
seeing
a
default
retroactive
provision,
but
i
believe
the
statute
becomes
effective
on
the
date
that
it
is
enacted
for...
as
the
default
provision,
and
to
that
degree
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
should
the
department
today
institute
a
policy
refusing
to
process
visa
applications
on...
and
discriminating
in
that
process
on
grounds
of
race,
nationality,
or
sex,
then
a
person
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
relief
and
would
have
no
right
to
obtain
relief.
mr.
daniel
wolf
this
partic...
in
our
particular
case,
what...
the
important
retroactive
event
is
the
secretary's
determination,
refusing
to
process
immigrant
visa
applications
at
a
time
when
he
was
required
to
do
so.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
indicating
that
the...
indicating
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
retroactively
legalize
conduct
which
was
unlawful
at
the
time.
mr.
daniel
wolf
section
11...
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
wolf
well,
i
would
say
that
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
stevens,
is
provided
for
in
roadway
express,
where
the...
this
court
stated
that
the
fact
that
a
statute
may...
the
congress
often
enacts
statutes
that
purports
to
interpret
what
a
provision
means
and
tells
a
court
how
to
interpret
what
a
provision
means,
but
that
does
not
make
the
statute
any
the
more
retroactive
than
any
other
type
of
congressional
enactment.
mr.
daniel
wolf
well,
with
respect
to
what
happened
before--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
i'm
asking...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
roadway
express
the
court
specifically
adopted
a
very
similar
type
of
statute
that
informed
the
court
as
to
how
the
statute
should
be
construed.
the
court
stated
that
that
did
not
apply
to
conduct
that
had
predated
the
statute.
in
other
words,
the
statute
cannot
make
lawful
what
was
unlawful--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--which,
justice
ginsburg,
is
exactly
what
happened
in
roadway
express.
i
mean,
certainly
the
congress
could
inform
this
court--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--yes.
it's
cited
in
the
supplemental
brief.
mr.
daniel
wolf
taking
the
first
of
your...
taking
the
first
part
of
your
question
first,
as
this
court
indicated
in
rusello,
the
interpretations
of
a
future...
of
a
new
congress
are
hazardous
grounds
upon
which
to
base
interpretations
of
a
previous
congress.
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
certainly
injunctive
relief
like
all
relief,
compensatory
damages,
operates
in
the
future,
but
there's
nothing
that
prevent...
that
in
this
statute
deprives
the
court
of
the
power
to
remedy
a
past
violation
of
the
wrong.
in
all
of
the
cases
that...
in
which...
to
which
i
believe
you're
referring,
justice
o'connor,
the
statute
specifically
eliminated
a
remedy,
but
in
our
case
there's
nothing
in
section
633
that
eliminates
a
remedy.
it
simply
informs
the
court
of
how
congress
would
like
the
court
to
construe
the
statute,
but
if
congress
wanted
the
court...
wanted
to
apply
that
retroactively,
the
uniform
decisions
of
this
court
are
that
it
must
say
so
expressly,
and
there
is
nothing
in
section
633
that
does
that.
mr.
daniel
wolf
the...
well,
this
court
has
also
held
in
numerous
occasions,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
congress
wants
to
take
away
a
remedy,
that
it
also
must
do
so
expressly,
and
again,
there's
nothing
about
section
633
that
takes
away
a
remedy.
it
simply
informs
this
court
of
how
the
statute
should
be
construed,
and
that
is
why
i
think
river
express
is
dispositive
on
this
point.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
even
in
roadway
express
the
court
mentioned...
stated
that
even
if
congress
disapproves
of
a
previous
opinion,
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
retroactive,
and
the
only
expressions
of
legislative
intent
that
we've
seen
really
are
two
statements
of
congressmen
who
are
opposed
to
the
bill,
which
also
this
court
has--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--which
the
department
cites
in
its
brief.
mr.
daniel
wolf
oh,
that
was
a
letter
previous
to
the
enactment
of
the
bill.
those
comments--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--mm-hmm
well,
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and
the
fact
that,
as
i
indicated,
the
fact
that
congress
may
have
a
view
as
to
whether
a
particular
decision
is
correct
or
incorrect
doesn't
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
retroactive.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
department's
policy
is
discriminatory
and
violated
section
1152(a)(1)
at
the
time,
section
1152(a)(1)
prohibits...
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
discriminated
against
in
the
issuance
of
an
immigrant
visa
on
the
basis
of
race,
sex,
and
nationality.
section
1152(a)(1)
therefore
places
nationality
on
the
same
footing
as
race
and
gender
and
prohibits
discrimination
with
respect
to
all
in
the
issuance
of
an
immigrant
visa.
this
policy
is
facially
discriminatory.
if
a
french
person
or
a
chinese
person
is
in
hong
kong
and
has
been
screened
out,
they
can
go
to
the
u.s.
consulate,
or
could,
prior
to
the
change
in
the
law,
go
to
the
u.s.
consulate
and
have
their
visa
processed,
but
if
that
person
was
a
vietnamese
national,
and
they
were
screened
out
or
illegally
in
hong
kong,
they
could
not.
they'd
have
to
go
back
to
vietnam
to
have
their
visas
issued
and
processed.
now,
the
department
argues
that
the
fact
that
this
policy
took
place
in
the
context
of
the
cpa,
and
the
unique
circumstances
facing
the
vietnamese
refugee
crisis
at
the
time
justified
its
illegal
policy.
and
then
the
department
makes
this
sort
of
funny
argument
that
justification
and
discrimination
are
the
same
thing.
but
this
court
has
never
considered
just...
discrimination
and
justification
as
one
question.
they're
two
separate
questions.
the
first
question
is,
does
the
policy...
is
the
policy
facially
discriminatory?
does
it
draw
an
explicit
distinction
between
vietnamese
nationals
and
laotian
nationals,
if
laotian
nationals
are
in
fact
covered,
and
the
nationals
of
other
countries,
and
the
answer
to
that
must
be
yes.
the
second
question
then
is,
does
the
policy...
is
the
policy
justified?
is
there
a
compelling
interest
for
the
policy?
what
is
the
rationalization
for
the
policy?
but
the
statute
prohibits
discrimination
in
the
issuance
of
a
visa,
and
does
not
allow
exceptions
for
the
rational
basis
that
the
department
prefers,
and
the
department's
argument
at
any
rate
with
respect
to
the
comprehensive
plan
of
action--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
places
race,
sex,
and
nationality
as
a
category,
and
therefore
that...
therefore
you
cannot
dis...
you
cannot
differentiate
between
races,
between
genders.
the
statute
describes
that.
let
me
give
an
example.
think
about
the...
of
course,
the
court's
classic
decisions
in
hirabayashi
and
korematsu.
the
court
specifically
in
hirabayashi
said,
well,
japanese
americans
are
not
similarly
situated
to
other
americans.
well,
that
didn't
mean
it
wasn't
discriminatory.
the
department--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
justice
breyer--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--justice
breyer,
there's
no
specific
legislative
history
of
this
provision.
i
would
say
that
the
statute
says
what
it
says,
no
person
shall
be
discriminated
against--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
i...
the
language
says
what
it
says,
and
the
courts
should
construe
the
language
as
it
says
it.
now,
the
department--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
in--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--it
seems
doubtful
to
me,
justice
breyer,
because
the
statute
prohibits
discrimination,
and
discrimination
is
a
different
concept
than
the
rationalization
for
the
particular
conduct
at
issue.
even
the
department
does
not
maintain
under
the
statute
the
mere
rational
basis
for
its
conduct
would
justify
these
particular
types
of
distinctions.
mr.
daniel
wolf
if
a
vietnamese
was
not
a
boat
person?
mr.
daniel
wolf
well,
there
are
a
number
of
vietnamese
who
came
by
bus,
and--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--oh,
certainly.
certainly.
a
vietnamese
boat
person
who
was
lawfully
resident--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
justice
stevens,
if
you
take
two
people,
two
nationals
in
the
same
circumstances,
one
a
vietnamese
who
has
been
denied
refugee
status,
one
french
who
have
been
denied
refugee
status,
the
french
person
can
walk
into
the
consulate,
get
their
visa,
the
vietnamese
person
cannot.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
facially
discriminatory.
mr.
daniel
wolf
well,
justice
stevens,
i
can't
see
how
the
fact
that
somebody
came
by
boat
or
by
plane
would--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
with
respect
to
the
cpa
again,
that
issue
seems
to
me
to
go
to
the
rational
basis,
to
the
justification
for
the
conduct,
not
to
the
classification
of
the
conduct.
mr.
daniel
wolf
yes,
but
with
respect
to
the
same
subcategories
of
other
countries,
such
as
the
same
subcategory
of
french,
the
vietnamese
would
be
treated
differently.
now,
it
is
true
that
vietnamese
are
under
the
rubric
of
the
comprehensive
plan
of
action,
but
the
plan...
comprehensive
plan
of
action
is
addressed
only
to
vietnamese.
mr.
daniel
wolf
well,
justice
ginsburg,
actually,
as
i
recall
in
korematsu
and
hirabayashi,
at
at
least
one
particular
time
the
classification
only
applied
to
japanese
on
the
west
coast
who
were
rounded
up
and
placed
into
relocation
centers,
so
the
fact
that
it
didn't
also
apply...
might
not
have
also
applied
to
japanese
on
the
east
coast
would
not
have
rendered
the
classification
there
any
the
less
discriminatory,
so
in
terms
of
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
discriminatory,
there
really
should
be
no
question.
with
respect
to
the
cpa
argument
anyway,
it
appears
to
be
purely
pretextual.
at
pages
116
and
117
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
department
was
inquiring...
received
an
inquiry
from
its
consulate
as
to
whether
or
not
the
processing
of
a
screened-out
boat
person
would
violate
the
cpa.
the
department
said
that
to
require
such
a
boat
person
to
return
to
vietnam
to
have
their
visas
processed
was
procedural
overkill
and
not
at
all
necessary
to
the
integrity
of
the
cpa
and,
in
fact,
during
4
years
of
the
cpa's
existence,
from
1989
to
1993,
the
department
processed
visa
applications
in
hong
kong,
and
the
department
processes
visa
applications
in
hong
kong
of
nationals
from
other
countries
such
as
great
britain,
england...
from
great
britain,
from
hong
kong
itself,
from
australia...
so
all
of
these
visas
are
being
processed
in
hong
kong.
it's
hard
to
understand
why
this
violates
the
cpa.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
department's
argument
with
respect
to
the
cpa--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--justice
scalia,
that
gets
directly
to
my
point,
that
the
department
seems
to
be
confusing
the
justification
for
its
policy
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
policy
is
a
discriminatory
one,
and--
mr.
daniel
wolf
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
line,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
this
court
has
drawn
in
numerous
cases
in
the
equal
protection
context,
in
the
context
of
numerous
statutes
that
prohibit
discrimination,
and
in
view
of...
congress
certainly
was
aware
of
how
this
court
interprets
the
meaning
of
discrimination
when
it
passed
the
statute
in
1965,
and
there's
no
reason
to
interpret
this
statute--
