mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
undertakings
by
the
united
states
in
connection
with
a
comprehensive
plan
of
action,
an
international
agreement
entered
into
by
50
countries
in
1989
to
address
the
migrant
crisis
in
southeast
asia
in
the
1980's.
by
1989,
750,000
migrants
from
vietnam
alone
had
fled
to
other
countries.
some
countries
began
to
turn
back
the
migrants
at
sea,
which
resulted
in
a
loss
of
life,
and
hong
kong
revoked
its
prior
policy
of
treating
the
arrived
migrants
as
presumptive
refugees,
and
began
to
treat
them
instead
as
illegal
aliens.
the
comprehensive
plan
of
action,
or
cpa,
was
designed
to
diffuse
this
crisis,
to
protect
those
migrants
who
genuinely
feared
persecution,
to
save
the
loss
of
life,
or
to
prevent
the
loss
of
life,
and
also
to
control
further
illegal
immigration.
under
the
cpa,
vietnamese
and
laotians
were
permitted
to
land
in
hong
kong
and
other
countries,
and
to
seek
refugee
status
there.
those
who
were
screened
in
or
found
to
be
refugees
under
international
standards
and
under
the
auspices
of
the
unhcr
were
permitted
to
remain
temporarily
and
seek
resettlement
in
third
countries,
but
a
central
tenet
of
the
cpa
was
those
that
were
screened
and
found
not
to
be
refugees
would
be
repatriated
to
their
countries
of
origin.
that
would
be
either
voluntarily,
it
was
hoped,
or
if
need
be,
eventually
involuntarily.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
afraid
there
must
have
been
some
confusion.
i'm
informed
by
the
state
department
that
the
state
department
did
not
refuse
that.
and
i'm
informed
that
last
week
there
were
discussions
approaching
the
government
of
hong
kong
about
this.
those
discussions
again
were
taken
up
over
the
weekend,
and
just
this
morning
we
received
from
hong
kong
a
letter
in
which
hong
kong...
and
i
just
received
it.
i've
given
it
to
opposing
counsel,
but
we
did
not
have
time
to
transmit
it
to
the
court
this
morning.
in
that
letter,
hong
kong
confirms
a
request
made
by
the
united
states
that
the
24
vietnamese
migrants
who
are
listed
in
an
attached
memorandum
who
are
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
and
those
of
lisa
le,
basically
the
migrants
for
whom
we
previously
had
requested
and
obtained
assurances,
would
not
be
repatriated
before
january
1997,
january
31,
1997
or
the
completion
of
this
case,
whichever
comes
first.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
remand
through
january
31.
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
this
case
on
remand.
the
government
of
hong
kong
is
understandably
getting
somewhat
impatient
and
also,
with
the
reversion
of
hong
kong
to
china
on
june
30,
the
government
of
hong
kong
is
eager
to
have
the
return
of
the
migrants
completed
and
especially,
given
the
recent
enactment
of
section
633
of
the
illegal
immigration
reform
act,
which
removes
the
statutory
basis
for
the
claim,
the
circumstances
of
this
case
have
substantially
changed,
but
yes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
requested--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
received
this
morning.
we
just
received
back
a
fax
this
morning
from
hong
kong.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
a
stay
in
this
case,
a
stay
is
not
necessary
because
no
injunction
was
ever
entered
in
this
case.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
its
decision.
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
situation
would
be,
pursuant
to
these
representations,
hong
kong
would
not
involuntarily
repatriate
anyone
in
this
case
or
the
lisa
le
case
before
january
31
unless
the
case
was
earlier
terminated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
lisa
le
case
it
did,
because
the
district
court
in
the
lisa
le
case
had
entered
injunctions
based
on
the
panel's
ruling
in
this
case.
the
district
court
in
that
case
entered
a
series
of
injunctions
which...
the
d.c.
circuit
for
a
month
declined
a
stay.
we
filed
a
stay
application
here,
and
then
when
that
stay
application
was
ripe
for
consideration
the
d.c.
circuit
entered
a
stay
and
the...
i
think
the
representations
we
previously
had
obtained
from
hong
kong
were
perhaps
instrumental
in
that
stay.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
a
stay--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
no.
it
was
a
stay
of
the
injunctions
requiring...
preventing
the
state
department
from
declining
to
process
the
visa
applications
of
hong
kong,
and
basically
the
stay
plus
hong
kong's
assurances
maintains
the
status
quo.
of
course,
the...
that
representation
does
not
prevent
anyone
from
voluntarily
repatriating.
we're
only
talking
about
involuntary
repatriations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the...
let
me
explain
it
this
way.
the
basis
for
the
government's
policy
is
that
persons
who
are
screened
out
under
the
cpa
must
return
to
their
country
of
origin
rather
than
applying
in
the
country
of
first
asylum.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
also
covers
laotians.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
in
hong
kong
it's
true
the
vast
majority,
in
fact
virtually
all
of
the
migrants
subject
to
the
cpa
in
hong
kong
are
from
vietnam,
but
the...
this
was...
this
is
a
situation
in
which,
in
fact,
there
are
no
other
aliens
similarly
situated
to
those
covered
by
the
cpa.
the
cpa
was
a
unique
but
perhaps
precedent-setting
international
agreement
to
address
migrant
crisis
of
a
sort
of
that
the
world
is
unfortunately
very
familiar
with
over
the
last
3
or
4
years.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes,
because
the
cpa
was
entered
into
to
address
a
migrant
crisis
that
was
itself
country-specific,
and
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
the
cpa,
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
frankly
cannot
represent
whether
there
are
people
from
other...
from
other
countries
besides
vietnam
and
laos.
this
agreement
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
the
predicate
for
the
application
of
this
policy
is
the
cpa
in
which
the
united
states
and
other
countries
undertook
as
a
way
of...
let
me
be
clear
about
this.
the
cpa
is
a
comprehensive
agreement
that
has
a
number
of
parts
to
it,
and
the
central
part
was,
in
order
to
get
the
countries
of
first
asylum
to
allow
people
to
land
in
the
first
place,
they
had
to
have
some
assurance
of
a
screening
opportunity
and
those
found
to
be
refugees
would
be
resettled.
but
an
important
corollary
is,
those
found
not
to
be
refugees
would
be
returned,
and
that...
but
the
people
found
not
to
be
refugees
includes
those
who
happen
to
have
current
visa
petitions
filed
on
behalf
of
them
in
the
united
states
and
others,
and
the
united
states,
in
consultation
with
unhcr
and
other
countries
of
first
asylum,
concluded
that
it
was
essential
to
carrying
out
the
cpa
to
maintain
that
with
respect
to
those
migrants
who
were
covered
by
the
cpa.
again,
this
was
a
problem
migrant
crisis-specific
agreement,
country-specific
agreement,
and
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations
and
addressing
migrant
crises.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
and
it
was
that
problem
the
cpa
addressed,
and
we
think
it
would
be
odd
indeed
if
the
united
states
in
its
conduct
of
foreign
relations,
where
it
can
treat
different
nations
differently
for
legitimate
foreign
policy
concerns,
could
not
also
treat
the
nationals
of
those
different
nations
differently
depending
on
the
circumstances
that
have
arisen
in
the
bilateral
or
unilateral...
i
mean,
multilateral
arrangements,
and
also
just
in
the
real
world
taking
account
of
what
has
caused
the
outflow
of
migrants.
most
migrant
crises
are
country-specific,
resulting
from
the
internal
conditions
of
a
particular
country.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in...
going
to
the
second
one
first
for
the
moment,
the...
we
did
argue
that...
i
think
the
argument
that
respondents
make
is
that
we
did
not
argue
that
the
question
of
consular
venue
is
separately
addressed
and
exclusively
addressed
by
8
u.s.c.
1202(a),
which
says
that
a
person
shall
apply
for
a
visa
in
such
locations
as
the
secretary
shall
prescribe
by
regulation.
but
we
certainly
did
argue
that
this
was...
that
1152(a)(1),
which
bars
preference
or
priority
or
discrimination
in
the
issuance
of
visas,
did
not
apply
to
consular
venue,
and
the
argument
that
consular
venue
is
separately
addressed
by
1202(a)
is
just
a
further
argument
in
support
of
our
basic
claim
that
the...
that
1152(a)(1)
did
not
apply
to
this
at
all.
and
in
fact
what
we
did
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
regulation
that
the
secretary
issued,
which
changed
on
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
amended
regulation
on
appeal,
that
that
was
issued
pursuant,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
to
the
very
specific
authority
in
1202(a),
which
is
the
consular
venue
statutory
provision.
so
we
think
all
these
arguments
were
presented.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
lower
court
we
argued
that
this
was...
that
this
was
not
discrimination,
at
least
that's
my
understanding,
and
also
that...
but
beyond
that
the
position
here
that
this...
that...
i
don't
know
if
one
calls
it
justification,
or
it's
not
discrimination,
that
you
can
look
at
it
either
way,
that
discrimination
is
a
conclusion
that
encompasses
whatever
justifications
may
be
offered
for
the
policy,
or
that
it's
not
discrimination
in
the
first
place.
if
the
question
just
focused
on
whether
there
were
distinctions,
then
the
statute
would
use
distinctions,
but
it
uses
the
word
discrimination,
which
i
think
we
would
view
as
being
a
conclusion,
and
read
into
that
should
be,
particularly
on
something
like
consular
venue,
the
ability
of
the
united
states
to
take
into
account
nationality
considerations.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
when
congress
enacted
this
provision
in
1965,
it
had
long
been
the
policy
of
the
united
states
before
then
and
since
then,
for
example,
to
adopt
special
procedures
for
security
purposes
for
aliens
from
particular
nations,
from
communist
bloc
countries
for
a
while,
and
as
the...
there's
a
declaration
cited
at
page
17
of
our...
of
the
petition
that
describes
that
history
and
describes
what
was
before
congress
in
1965.
i
think
that
goes
to
both...
to
actually
two
points,
that
1152(a)(1),
the
nondiscrimination
provision,
didn't
apply
to
the
applications
for
visas
in
the
first
place,
but
even
if
it
did.
congress
couldn't
have
not...
could
not
have
meant
to
absolutely
prohibit
the...
irrespective
of
the
justification
the
taking
into
account
of
nationality
in
the
processing,
in
the
procedures
for
the
filing,
the
venue,
and
the
review
of
visa
applications,
that
the
nondiscrimination
provision
was
really
intended
from
the
outset
to
apply
only
to
the
allocation
of
visas.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
did.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
they
made
two
further
arguments.
first
of
all,
in
the
statutory
argument,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
the
recent
amendment
we
think
is
dispositive,
and
one
more
piece
of
information
on
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to.
at
page
21
of
respondent's
brief
in
footnote
13
they
cite
a
letter
that
was
sent
to
the...
by
45
members
of
congress
to
the
president
in
early
august
urging
the
president
to
drop
his
support
for
the
provision
of
the
bill
that
was
ultimately
enacted
in
6...
as
633
that
was
then
in
conference,
45
members
of
congress,
and
they
said
apparently
those
provisions
were
included
in
the
house
and
senate
bills
at
the
behest
of
the
state
department
in
order
to
overturn
the
adverse
result
of
the
lavas
decision,
so
it's
entirely
clear
that
the
members
of
congress
when
considering
this
provision,
when
it
finally
emerged
from
conference,
knew
that
it
was
proposed
for
the
purpose
of
and
would
have
the
effect
of
overturning
the
decision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that's
correct,
and
we
think
it's
clear,
quite
aside
from
this
legislative
history
making
clear
that
this
was
intended
to
apply
to
this
very
situation,
the
usual
principles
governing
prospective
relief
would
make
clear
that
it's
effective
prospectively.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
not
entirely,
because
it
would
seem
to
us
that
any
injunctive
relief
in
this
case
would
direct
the
secretary
of
state
to
provide
for
the
issuance
of
visas
in
hong
kong
in
the
future,
and
that's
the
very
reason
why
prospective
relief
cannot
be
granted
if
it
would
be
in
conflict
with
a
new
statute,
and
the
conference
and
house
reports
on
this
legislation
say
that
it
was
just
intended
to
clarify
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
unreviewable
authority
to
establish
visa
venue
rules,
so
it's
clear
that
congress
was
ratifying
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
intended
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
in
fact,
the
text
of
633
says
that
nothing
in
this
paragraph...
meaning
1152(a)(1)...
shall
be
construed
to
prohibit
the
secretary
from
establishing
procedures
for
the
filing
of
applications.
respondents
are
asking
this
court
to
construe
1152(a)(1)
in
a
way
that
would
apply
to
bar
the
secretary
from
doing
exactly
that,
so
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
speaks
directly
to
what
this
court
is
being
asked
to
do.
i'd
like--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
excuse
me.
i...
we
would
seek
an
expeditious
response
in
the
lower
court.
whether
that
would
involve
presenting
the
whole
matter
to
the
full
court
or
waiting
for
the
panel
to
rule
would
be
a
different...
a
question
we
would
have
to
discuss.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
that
is
correct.
now,
there
is...
we
recognize
the
confusion,
and
there
is
something
to
be
said,
we
acknowledge,
for
this
court
going
ahead
and
deciding
the
case
now
that
it's
been
briefed
and
argued
and
presented
to
it.
our
suggestion
of
a
remand
in
this
case
all
along,
however,
was
based
on
this
court's
usual
course
when
there's
been
an
intervening
change
in
the
law
and
also
when
other
issues
are
in
the
case
that
haven't
been
addressed.
i
would
like
briefly
to
address
those
two
other
issues,
getting
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
on
them.
the
first
of
the
other
two
claims
is
one
that
the
policy
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
in
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
the
first
is
that
judicial
review
of
that
claim
is
precluded,
as
was
judicial
review
of
the
statutory
claim,
and
that
is
itself
true
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
comprehensive
judicial
review
provisions
of
the
ina
establish
that
review
is
precluded
under
the
ina,
or,
excuse
me,
under
the
apa,
and
also
visa
matters,
including
consular
venue
matters,
are
of
the
sort
traditionally
committed
to
agency
discretion,
and
therefore
barred...
judicial
review
is
barred
for
that
reason
as
well.
with
respect
to
the
preclusion
of
review,
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
ina
contains
provisions
for
judicial
review
of
deportation
orders
of
people
who've
entered
the
united
states,
and
also
for
judicial
review
of
people
who
are
seeking
to
enter
the
united
states,
but
in
the
latter
category,
only
when
somebody
has
arrived
at
our
shores
and
is
in
exclusion
proceedings
and
can
seek
review
in
habeas
corpus,
but
not
because
exclusion
matters
are
generally
appropriate
for
judicial
review,
but
because
the
person
is
in
custody,
and
therefore
has
access
to
habeas
corpus.
in
this
court's
decision
in
brownell
v.
tom
we
shung
in
1956,
the
court
held
that
an
alien
in
the
united
states
could
have
access
to
the
apa
to
seek
judicial
review
in
an
exclusion
matter,
but
the
court
pointed
out
it
was
not
suggesting,
of
course,
that
an
alien
who
had
never
reached
our
shores
would
be
able
to
do
that,
and
it
also
cited
legislative
history
of
the
'52
act
in
which
an
exclusive
review
provision
was
deleted
in
which
the...
in
which
congress
made
clear
that
it
was
not
providing
for
review
of
consular
officer
decisions,
or
changing
review
under
the
ina.
then
in
1961,
congress
came
along
and
specifically
overturned
the
brownell
decision,
and
provided
for
judicial
review
in
exclusion
only...
in
exclusion
matters
only
in
habeas
corpus,
and
not
otherwise,
intending
to
remove
the
apa,
the
very
basis
on
which
respondents
seek
to
bring
a
challenge
in
this
case.
and
in
fact
the
court...
we
spell
this
out
at
pages
25
to
28
of
our
brief,
and
in
fact
the
house
report
on
that
legislation
says
that
permitting
an
apa
suit
would
"give
recognition
to
a
fallacious
doctrine
that
an
alien
has
a
right
to
enter
this
country
which
he
may
litigate
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
against
the
u.s.
government
as
a
defendant.
"
well,
if
that
was
true
with
respect
to
aliens
who
had
reached
our
shores,
then
a
fortiori
would
be
true
with
respect
to
aliens
who
are
in
hong
kong
who
have
no
rights
under
the
united
states
constitution
with
respect
to
their
admission
and
no
statutory
rights
that
they
can
invoke
in
court.
but
even
if
this
court
were
somehow
to
get
around
the
preclusion
of
judicial
review,
we
think
the
respondent's
apa
claim
would
fail
on
the
merits.
this
is
certainly
not
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
policy.
the
explanation
is
spelled
out
at
pages
217
to
219
of
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
in
which
the
cable
that
went
to
the
field
in
october
of
1994
explains
that
this
policy
was
reinstated
after
a
careful
review,
after
concerns
were
received
from
unhcr
and
other
first...
and
first
asylum
countries
that
screening
or
processing
immigrant
visas
in
hong
kong
and
other
first
asylum
countries
was
discouraging
people
from
returning
voluntarily
and
therefore
was
seriously
undermining
the
comprehensive
plan
of
action.
the
state
department
also
pointed
out
that
since
1990,
when
it
had
adopted
the
opposite
view,
it
believed
that
conditions
in
vietnam
had
improved,
and
therefore
it
was
appropriate
to
insist
that
people
return
there
before
filing
for
visas
to
come
to
the
u.s.--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
specifically.
the
court
surely
has
the
power
to
do
it,
and
we
don't
deny
that,
and
frankly
we
believe
the
other
two
claims
can
be
very
readily
disposed
of,
and
so
we...
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
on
remand
we
would
expect
the
court
of
appeals
to
readily
dispose
of
the
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
itself,
for
example,
applied
the
change
in
the
regulation
on
appeal,
even
though
the
respondents
were
invoking
claims
under
the
prior
regulation,
on
the
theory
that
no
one
has
a
vested
right
in
receiving
a
visa,
and
if
there's
a
change
in
the
law,
that
should
be
applied.
we
would
expect
the
court
to
do
that.
in
fact,
we
would
expect
congress
understood,
knowing
the
lavas
decision,
that
that
would
be
the
rule
and
it's
change
in
the
law
would
be
applied.
that's
another
piece
of
information.
but
specifically,
no,
but
we
understand
that
the
court
has
the
power.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
that
would
be
our--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
our
primary
submission.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
several
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
in
landgraf
this
court
said
when
the
intervening
statute
authorizes
or
affects
the
propriety
of
prospective
relief,
application
of
the
new
provision
is
not
retroactive,
so
analytically
the
question
here
is
not
one
of
retroactivity,
since
prospective
relief
is
being
asked
for,
and
that's
what
the
court
is
being
asked
to
do.
this
statute
specifically
speaks
to
what
a
court
should
do,
whether
a
court
can
construe
1152(a)(1)
to
prohibit
the
secretary
from
establishing
locations
for
the
processing
of
visas,
as
justice
stevens
mentioned.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
that
would
be...
that
would
i
think
be
not
upset...
i
mean,
again,
that
would
be
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
it
would
not
be
a
question
of
an
injunctive
action.
it
would
be
a
question
of
a
rule
of
procedure
to
be
applied
in
an
ongoing
case
much
like
landgraf,
speaking
to
what
a
court
has
to
do,
has
to
decide
at
the
time
it's
deciding
a
particular
issue
in
a
case.
at
the
time
the
court
decides
venue,
it
decides
venue,
and
the
statute
shouldn't
reach
back
and
change
that.
this
statute
is
not
retroactive
in
the
sense
that
people
who
got
visas
in
1993
during
the
interim
period
when
the
state
department
had
a
contrary
view,
will
have
those
visas
taken
away
and
be
sent
back
to
hong
kong.
this
is
entirely
prospective,
and
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
congress'
intent
that
this
governed
this
case,
the
letter
from
the
45
members
of
congress
said
that
the
amendment
would
overturn
the
adverse
result
in
lavas.
the
state
department's
letter
said
it's
amendment
was
intended
to
reverse
the
decision
in
lavas.
representative
smith
said
it
was
an
attempt
to
overrule
lavas,
and
representative
conyers
said
it
would
have
the
immediate
effect
of
requiring
two
dozen
vietnamese,
precisely
these
two
dozen
vietnamese
in
hong
kong,
to
return
to
vietnam.
there
was
no
doubt
that
congress
intended
and
expected
this
to
apply
to
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
discrimination,
this
only
covers
people
who
were
screened
out
under
the
cpa.
screened
out
is
a
term
of
art
under
international
refugee
matters,
applying
it
here
to
this
international
agreement.
it
doesn't
apply
to
other
people
who
may
be
in
hong
kong
like
a
vietnamese
national
who
may
have
gotten
there
in
other
ways.
also,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
this
is
not
invidious
discrimination
by
any
means.
the
united...
vietnamese
have
been
the
beneficiaries
of
united
states
immigration
policy
over
the
last
15
years
to
an
extent
that
few
other
countries
have
matched:
1.2
million
vietnamese
have
entered
the
united
states,
including
400,000
who
have
departed
from
vietnam
during
the
orderly
departure
process.
there
is
no
way
that
this
policy
can
be
regarded
as
invidious
discrimination
against
vietnamese.
it
is
designed
to
implement
valid
foreign
policy.
my
last
point
is
that
the
discussion
in
this
case
is...
we
think
underscores
why
this
sort
of
case
doesn't
belong
in
court
to
begin
with.
this
is
a
case
challenging
foreign
policy
and
migration
policy
halfway
around
the
world
in
a
suit
brought
by
aliens
in
a
foreign
country
objecting
to
the
way
in
which
their
visas
are
being
processed
in
a
foreign
country,
a
classic
matter
for
which
judicial
review
is
precluded,
and
has
traditionally
been
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law.
and
that
rule
cannot
be
circumvented
by
having
a
u.s.
citizen
who
happens
to
have
applied
for
a
visa
petition
to
file
his
or
her
own
suit
in
u.s.
courts.
the
immigration
act
makes
clear
that
the
visa
petitioner's
interest
in
a
matter
such
as
this
is
simply
filing
the
visa
petition
and
having
the
attorney
general
determine
whether
the
beneficiary
of
the
visa
petition
would
be
entitled
to
a
visa
preference.
once
that
happens,
the
u.s.
person's
interest
in
the
matter
lapses.
there
is
no
further
interest.
the
alien
abroad
is
accorded
a
preference
and
stands
entirely
on
his
own
or
her
own
with
respect
to
whether
there
will
be
any
admission
to
the
united
states.
in
fact,
the
nondiscrimination
provision
invoked
here
speaks
in
terms
of
discrimination
or
preferences
with
respect
to
the
alien
abroad.
it
confers
no
rights
on
a
u.s.
citizen
in
the
united
states.
so
with
respect
to
both
respondent's
apa
claim
and
the
statutory
claim,
review
is
precluded.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you.
