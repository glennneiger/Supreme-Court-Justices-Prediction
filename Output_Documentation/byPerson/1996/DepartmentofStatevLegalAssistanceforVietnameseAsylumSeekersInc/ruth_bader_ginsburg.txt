justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
at
the
outset
what
the
government's
position
is
with
respect
to
the
statement
by
the
respondents
that
the
respondents
requested
the
state
department
to
seek
from
the
hong
kong
government
an
extension
of
the
undertaking
to
process
these
people
to
cover
the
proceedings
on
remand,
and
that
the
department
refused,
so
that
a
remand
would
force
the
hong
kong
government's
undertaking
to
lapse
and
would
likely
subject
respondents
to
immediate
forcible
repatriation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
took
that
to
be
what
you
represented
to
this
court
in
your
motion
to
join...
in
your
response
to
the
motion
to
join
additional
parties,
because
there
you
said
that
the
government
obtained
insurances
from
the
hong
kong
government
that
both
the
lisa
le
plaintiffs
and
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
would
not
be
forcibly
repatriated
during
appellate
and
supreme
court
proceedings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
am
i
correct
in
saying
the
appellate
proceedings
would
encompass
whatever
happens
in
the
lisa
le
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
case
on
remand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
view
is...
your
representation
is
that
it's
january
30
or
the
termination
of
proceedings
here
and
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
whichever
is
earlier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
january
30
date
or
the
termination
of
proceedings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
d.c.
circuit
had
not
earlier
entered
a
stay,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
class
includes
only
those
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
cpa
doesn't
apply,
and
you
wouldn't
be
following
that
with
respect
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--nationals
from
any
countries--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
with
respect
to
the
two
issues
that
were
not
decided
by
the
d.c.
circuit,
they
haven't
been
considered,
and
you
concede
that
they
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
case
and
would
be
ripe
for
consideration,
but
the
case...
this
case
and
lisa
le
both
raising
the
same
questions
but
going
on
different
tracks
are
somewhat
confusing,
disorderly.
what's
the
government's
plan
for
proceeding
should
we
grant
your
request
to
vacate
and
remand
to
the
d.c.
circuit
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
very
recent
legislative
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
currently
you
have
a
panel
in
this
case
and
an
en
banc
court
in
lisa
le.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
are
you
aware
of
any
case
that...
where
questions
such
as
these
were
raised
below,
not
touched
there,
and
where
this
court
responded
to
them
as...
not
as
a
court
of
review
but
the
only
court
to
pass
on
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolf,
the
d.c.
circuit
was
prepared
to
hear
the
lisa
le
case
en
banc
on
september
19
and
deferred
that
only
because
the
proceeding
was
pending
here.
why
would
you
not
think
that
they
would
proceed
expeditiously
were
we
to
vacate
and
remand?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
what
possible
scenario
would
they
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
when
it
is
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
panel
that
is
the
problem,
not
the
initial...
the
district
court
was
just
following
the
orders
that
the
three-judge
panel
gave.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
d.c.
circuit
was
poised
to
litigate
it
en
banc.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
fact
that
the
cert
petition
was
granted
and
heard
doesn't
make
what
the
d.c.
circuit
was
intending
to
do
any
less
appropriate
than
when
the
d.c.
circuit
ordered
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
yet
again?
the
very
fact
that
the
d.c.
circuit
agreed
to
hear
the
case
en
banc
is
a
signal,
is
it
not,
that
the
court
was
quite
divided
and
was
not
content
to
let
it
rest
with
the
panel
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolf,
i
have
an
unrelated
question.
it
has
to
do
with
the
latest
submission.
you
represented
in
the
supplemental
brief
that
a
remand
of
the
case
would
cause
the
hong
kong
government's
undertaking
to
lapse
and
would
likely
subject
respondents
to
immediate
forcible
repatriation.
that's
a
rather
startling
representation,
and
when
i
looked
back
at
the
pleading
that
wasn't
even
printed
for
this
court,
it
was
the
government's
response
to
your
motion
to
joint
parties,
and
i
saw
when
i
read
to
mr.
kneedler
that
the
government
represented
that
they
would
obtain...
had
obtained
assurances
from
the
hong
kong
government
that
no
one
would
be
forcibly
repatriated
during
the
appellate
and
supreme
court
proceedings
in
this
case
and
in
the
lisa
le
case,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
rather
attention-grabbing
representation
you
made
in
view
of
the
government's
representation
that
conflicted
with
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
alleging
to
this
court
that
it
would
cause
immediate
repatriation,
do
you
not
think
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
let
us
know
that
the
government
had
something
quite...
said
something
quite
the
contrary,
had
represented
to
this
court
that
no
one
was
going
to
be
repatriated
pending
the
proceedings
here
and
in
lisa
le?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
described
in
rather
definite
terms
that
the
department
refused,
and
that
the...
that
would
cause...
i
mean,
you
didn't
put
anything...
you
didn't
indicate
to
us
that
anything
was
at
all
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
not
ambiguous,
but
you
just
said
to
me
that,
well,
you
thought
that
that
might
be
the
problem,
and
you
were
well
aware
that
the
government
had
already
represented
to
this
court
that
no
one
would
be
repatriated
until
this
court
and
the
d.c.
circuit
were
completed,
proceedings
were
completed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolf,
are
you
saying
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
clarifying
amendment?
here
we
had
a
sharp
division
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
excellent
opinions
on
both
sides
saying
what
the
judges
thought
this
statute
meant,
and
congress
then
came
in
and
said
we
think
that
the
dissent
had
it
right
about
what
the
statute
meant.
that's
a
clarifying
amendment.
so
whether
that
controls
us,
and
i
agree
with
you
it
doesn't,
it
is
the
congress
saying
we
think
that
the
statue
did
and
should
mean
what
the
dissenting
judge
thought
it
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
wolf,
doesn't...
haven't
you
already
shown
why
this
is
worlds
different
from
korematsu?
because
korematsu
applied
to
people
who
were
citizens
of
the
united
states
just
as
much
as
it
applied
to
someone
who
had
just
reached
the
shore.
so
it
was
a
blanket
policy,
and
you,
by
giving
the
answer
that
a
resident
of
hong
kong
from
vietnam
who
had
been
there
for
awhile,
was
not
involved
in
this
urgent
departure,
would
be
treated
like
the
frenchman.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
kneedler,
to
the
extent
that
this
is
like
a
venue
provision
where
you
can
have
this
processed,
if
congress
changes
a
venue
rule
while
a
case
is
in
a
tribunal,
i
assume
the
case
would
not
have
to
be
dismissed
at
midstream,
that
unless
congress
said
otherwise,
the
venue
that
was
proper
when
the
case
was
initiated
would
stay.
