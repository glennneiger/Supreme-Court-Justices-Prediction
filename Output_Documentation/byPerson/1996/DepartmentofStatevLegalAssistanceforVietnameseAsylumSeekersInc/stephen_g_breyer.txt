justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
you
think
when
congress
passed
this
statute,
did
it
have
in
mind
refusing
to
allow
the
state
department
to
carry
on
the
ordinary
country-by-country
distinctions
that
it
makes
in
conducting
foreign
policy?
i
mean,
it
might
have
done.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
mean,
is
there
any
evidence
that
it
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
it
says
what
it
says.
isn't
all
foreign
policy
discriminatory
by
nations?
we
treat
some
nations
one
way,
we
treat
other
nations
another
way.
all
foreign
policy
runs
that
way.
now,
maybe
this
was
to
be
an
exception
from
ordinary
foreign
policy,
but
should
we
assume
that
that
was
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
says
what
it
says,
wouldn't
we
normally
assume
that
what
it
had
in
mind
was
the
kind
of
discrimination
forbidding
that
kind
of
discrimination
that
did
exist
in
korematsu--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
not
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
is
consistent
with
ordinary
foreign
policy,
treating
one
nation
differently
from
another?
