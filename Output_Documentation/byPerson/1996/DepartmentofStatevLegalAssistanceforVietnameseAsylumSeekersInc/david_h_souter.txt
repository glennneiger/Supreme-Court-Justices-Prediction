mr.
kneedler,
as
long
as
we've
gotten
into
facts,
may
i
ask
you
about
the
government's
position
on
one
other
factual
issue
which
i'm
not
sure
of?
the
respondents,
as
i
recall,
made
the
representation...
this
goes
to
the
merits
of
their
claim...
that
with
respect
to
refugees
who
had
been
screened
out
who
were
in
hong
kong
from
other
countries
than
vietnam,
the
united
states
continues
to,
or
has,
i
guess,
never
refused
to
process
immigrant
visa
applications,
and
that
it
is
only
those
from
vietnam
who
have
been
the
subject
of
this
policy
pursuant
to
this
agreement.
and
i...
that
interests
me
because
it
seems
to
be
a
response
to
the
government's
position
that
in
fact
the
reason
for
the
government's
action
is
not
the
nationality
of
the
plaintiffs
but
the
illegality
of
their
status,
and
the
respondents
are
saying
there
are
plenty
of
others
with
equally
illegal
status,
but
if
they
are
from
a
different
country
they
are
being
treated
differently.
is
that...
is
the
respondent's
claim
factually
correct,
as
you
understand
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
cpa
cover
anything
other
than
vietnamese
refugees?
justice
david
h.
souter
laotians.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
the
class,
save
for
vietnamese
and
laotians,
is
an
empty
class.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
i
think
if
i
understand
your
answer,
it
is
there
are
no
refugees
from
other
countries
than
vietnam
and
laos
in
hong
kong
who
have
been
screened
out
and
who
are
applying
for
immigrant
visa
status.
there
are
no
such
individuals,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
not
under
the
cpa.
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless
of
the
cpa.
they're
either
there
or
they're
not
there.
are
there
any
such
making
applications?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
relief...
if
you
were
to
win
on
the
first
issue
as
you
have
described
it,
what
would
your
relief
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
concede
that
if
the
statute
in
fact
was
intended
to
be
retroactive,
that
relief
would
be
impossible?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
you
have
conceded
that
we
don't
have
that
power
if,
number
1,
you
are
not
seeking
damages,
and
you're
not,
and
number
2,
the
statute
is
in
fact
to
be
applied
retroactively.
on
those
two
assumptions,
there's
nothing
we
or
any
court
could
do,
even
on
your
own
premise,
but
apply
the
new
statute,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
everything
turns
on
the
retroactivity
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why
should
that
be
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
normally
the
first
cut
at
an
issue
like
that
is,
of
course,
not
taken
in
this
court?
