chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
95-1521,
united
states
department
of
state,
bureau
of
consular
affairs
v.
legal
assistance
for
vietnamese
asylum
seekers,
inc.--
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
the
cpa
arose
as
a
result
out
of
massive
migration
of
vietnamese
and
laotians--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
not
anybody
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
kneedler,
the
respondents
here
have
sought
only
injunctive
and
declarative
relief,
haven't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
did...
they've
not
sought
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
wolf,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you're
asking...
you
still
haven't
gotten
the
final
judgment
in
this
case,
and
what
you're
asking
for
is
some
sort
of
a
declaration
or
injunction
that
the
secretary
may
not
require
repatriation
from
hong
kong
in
order
to
process
visas.
now,
the
traditional
view
is
that
we
apply
the
law
in
effect
when
the...
when
our
court
decides
a
case,
or
the
court
of
appeals
applies
the
law
when
it...
in
effect
when
it
decides
it.
if
the
law
in
effect
now
is
that
your
clients
are
not
entitled
to
any
statutory
relief,
i
don't
see
where
your
idea
of
reparative
relief
goes
anywhere
in
the
light
of
the
new
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
under
presently
enforced
law
you're
not
entitled
to
that,
the
fact
that
you
might
have
been
entitled
to
it
a
year
ago
is
something
that
a
court
ordinarily
won't
recognize.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
substantive
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
if
you're
seeking
damages,
but
just...
your
whole
effort
here
was
prospective.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wolf,
supposing
somebody
comes
into
court
and
says,
up
until
1994
i
was
entitled
to
receive
a
certain
amount
of
money
as
a
pension,
but
i
realize...
this
is
1996...
now
congress
has
said
that
that
no
longer
obtains,
but
i
just
want
a
declaratory
judgment
that
i
might
have
received
it
had
i
applied
in
1994,
now,
would
a
court
grant
that
sort
of
a
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
take
the
surrounding
legislative
history
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
intended
to
disapprove
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
you
cite
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
cited
it
in
your
brief,
too,
didn't
you
at
footnote
13?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
you
say,
having
recently
become
aware
of
the
obscure
provision
45
congressmen,
including
13
members
of
the
house...
sent
a
letter
to
the
president
august
1
expressing
the
view
that
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
1152(a)(1)
was
correct.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
something
to
what
mr.
kneedler
said,
that
you
know,
discrimination
in
one
sense...
you
say
someone
has
a
discriminating
taste.
it
can
be
a
compliment.
it
simply
means
you
can
distinguish
between
different
things.
invidious
discrimination
is
something
else.
but
to
say
that
you
have
to
draw...
you
can
draw
a
bright
line
between
the
concept
of
discrimination
and
the
term
justification,
i
don't
think
is
necessarily
true.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolf.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
