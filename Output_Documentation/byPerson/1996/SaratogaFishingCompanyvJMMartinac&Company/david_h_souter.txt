justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
why
do
you
characterize
it
that
way?
the
first
buyer...
is
it
madruga
or
magruda?
justice
david
h.
souter
madruga.
the
first--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
the
first
buyer
in
effect
went
to
the
manufacturer
of
the
ship
and
said,
i
want
to
buy
90
percent
of
a
ship
to
fish
for
tuna.
i
will
complete
it.
i
will
put
in
whatever
it
was,
the
navigation
equipment,
the
skiff,
the
seines
and
so
on.
why
isn't
he
to
be
regarded
as
the
manufacturer
of
the
completed
product,
which
is
the
complete
tuna
fishing
ship?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
guess
you're
saying
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
first
question
way
back
earlier
on
in
the
argument...
i
think
you're
saying
that
the
capacity
of
the
end
user
to
contract
is
basically
irrelevant.
there's
simply
got
to
be
a
conventional
line,
and
the
conventional
line
which
would
work
as
well
as
any
other
is
the
one
that
we've
already
given
at
least
some
lip
service
to,
and
that's
the
402a
line.
so
it's
not
a...
it
doesn't
turn
on
the
power
to
contract.
it
turns
on
the
power
of
the
court
in
effect
to
impose
a
conventional
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
one
of
the...
i
think
one
of
the
questions
that
plays
around
in
this
case
is
that
when
the
ultimate
end
user,
who
later
becomes
a
plaintiff,
buys
whatever
he
buys,
he
can
contract
in
a
way
that
will
protect
him.
no
warranty,
extended
warranty,
warranty
plus
or
minus
insurance,
and
so
on.
and
you're
saying
that
the
capacity
of
that
end
user
who
later
becomes
a
plaintiff
to
contract
for
protection
when
he
buys
whatever
the
thing
is
he
buys
is
essentially
irrelevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
anything
that
wasn't
a
replacement,
i
take
it.
if
he
had
come
along
and
said,
i
think
it
would
be
great
to
have
a
second
skiff,
during
the
period
in
which
the
adder
of
the
second
skiff
owned
the
boat,
that
would
be
other
property
under
your
rule,
wouldn't
it,
and
then
it
would
cease
to
be
other
property
if
he
sold
the
boat
with
the
second
skiff
on
it.
isn't
that
correct
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
then
for
subsequent
sales
it
is
the
object
sold
in
the
subsequent
sales
that
is
the
product,
and
that's
what
protects
him,
and
the
one
loophole
in
that
protection,
i
take
it,
is
in
the
period
between
the
time...
between
sales.
let's
say,
the
period
between
the
sale
to
the
second
buyer,
who
then
adds
not
just
replacement
equipment
but
adds
equipment
to
it
like
the
second
skiff.
during
that
period
the
manufacturer
has
gotten
other
property
liability
if
the
second
skiff
gets
blown
up
along
with
the
ship,
but
if
you're
lucky,
and
the
second
skiff
and
the
ship
are
then
sold
to
a
third
purchaser,
then
he's
off
the
hook
again.
is
that
the
way
your
theory
works?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
bought
a
ship
without
a
second
skiff.
then
he
adds
the
second
skiff,
so
the
second
skiff
is
not
subject
to
the
bargain
that
he
made
when
he
purchased
the
ship,
so
i
thought
on
your
theory
the
second
skiff
is
other
property
during
that
second
owner's
ownership,
but
when
the
second
owner
then
sells
to
a
third,
and
the
second
skiff
goes
with
it,
then
the
second
skiff
is
part
of
the
bargain.
the
product
then
includes
the
second
skiff,
and
there
wouldn't
be
product
liability
vis-a-vis
the
original
manufacturer.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
thing
you're
saying
that
contract
controls
i
think
is,
the
value
of
the...
the
identity
of
the
product
for
the
plaintiff's
purpose
when
the
plaintiff
sues.
that's
the
only...
that
is
the
only
point
at
which
contract
law
is
controlling
on
your
theory,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
and
that's
why,
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't
have
a
category...
you
don't
make
any
categorical
distinction
between
property
loss
and
personal
injury
because
in
the
case
that
i
was
giving
you
before
you
said,
well,
if
the
second
skiff
is
injured
as
a
result
of
the
products
defect
while
the
product
is
owned
by
the
person
who
bought
the
second
skiff,
the
second
skiff
would
be
other
property
and
would
be
recoverable.
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
by
the
same
token,
if
the
second
owner
were
injured
personally,
those
personal
injuries
would
be
recoverable.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
only
categorical
distinction
you're
making
is
the
categorical
distinction
that
involves
saying,
you
define
what
product
is
for
the
plaintiff's
purpose
by
looking
to
the
contract
by
which
the
plaintiff
bought
whatever
it
was
the
plaintiff
bought.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
okay.
