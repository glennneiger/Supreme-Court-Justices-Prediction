justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
first...
suppose
you
have
the
first
sale,
a
screw.
a
defective
screw
is
in
the
engine,
and
then
the
engine
goes
in
the
boat,
and
then
the
boat
is
resold,
all
right.
everybody
i
think
agrees
that
if
it's
a
defective
screw
that
blows
up,
and
it
blows
up
the
engine,
that
you
can't
recover
in
tort
for
the
engine
because
the
it
is
the
engine,
right?
is
that
right?
that's
the
defective
product.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
you
have
a
screw
that's
defective,
and
it's
in
an
engine,
and
the
engine
blows
up
because
of
the
screw.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
what's
original?
you
see,
i
mean,
what
you
had
was
a
screw
that
was
sold
to
an
engine-builder
that
was
sold
to
a
shipbuilder
that
was
sold
to
another
captain.
you
talk
about
the
defective
product,
and
then
the
downstream
things
from
the
defective
product.
i
take
it
what
your
opponents
are
arguing
is
that
this
resold
ship
is
the
defective
product.
what
i'm
looking
for...
and
the
line
of
the
defective
product
is
a
contract
line.
that's
what
i
think
people...
i
mean,
at
least
i
think
they're
driving
at
that.
so
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what's
the
line?
what's
the
english
words
that
would
describe
a
circumstance
so
that
we
all
agree
that
engine
in
my
hypothetical
case
with
the
screw
is
the
defective
product
but
your
resold
ship
is
not
the
defective
product?
what
words
in
english,
or
what
line
of
law
clearly
defines
those
two,
making
the
one
the
defective
product
but
not
the
other,
because
i
think
you
have
to
find
that
line
in
order
to
win
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
why
isn't
it
the
screw?
the
screw
entered
the
scream
of...
the
screw
entered
the
stream
of
commerce
in
the
defect...
so
that
doesn't
work,
so
that
would
then
mean
that
the
engine
wouldn't
be
the
defective
product,
but
we
all
agree
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
whole
ship
went
to...
the
completed
product
to
your
present
client.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand.
my
problem...
you
see
my
problem?
my
problem
is,
what's
the
defective
product?
what's
the
first
time?
to
put
it
another
way--
--yes.
--why
is
a
screw
a
component
part
of
an
engine,
but
an
engine
is
not
a
component
part
of
a
ship
under
your
theory?
or
the
first--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--isn't
the
component
part
of
the
improved
ship.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
why
isn't
what
your
client
bought
the
defective
product?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
all
that
happened
was
that
the...
they
simply
added
a
few
nets
and
things,
just
as
the
engine
manufacturer
added
some
metal
to
the
screw,
just
as
the
shipbuilder
added
some
wood
to
the
engine,
and
then,
see,
we
have
a
line
here
that
works
against
you
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
how
does
that...
how
does
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
does
that
work,
because
what
is
the...
i
mean,
suppose
the
screw
blows
up
while
the
manufacturer's
turning
it
into
an
engine?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine...
no,
in
the
engine
shop,
the
screw
blows
up,
okay.
so
i
guess
the
manufacturer
could
sue
the
screw-making
for
damage
to
the
engine,
couldn't
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
you're
right.
i'm
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
your
client
can
sue
for
damage
to
the
engine.
of
course,
he
can't.
in
other
words,
this
line,
ultimate
consumer,
is
just
as
flaky
as
the
other
one.
what's
an
ultimate
consumer
in
a
commercial
context
where
a
person
uses
a
screw
to
make
an
engine
to
make
a
ship,
to
sail
in
the
water
to
get
fish
to
sell
to
the
ultimate
consumer
who
eats
the
fish?
i
mean,
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
fine.
whatever
you
bought
from
the
manufacturer,
then,
after
all,
the
maker
of
the
engine
could
sue
the
screw-maker
for
damage
to
the
engine,
but
we
know
he
can't,
so
madruga
vis-a-vis
the
ship
they're
saying
is
in
the
same
position
as
the
engine-maker
vis-a-vis
the
screw-maker.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
just
as
the
engine--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
see
the...
i'm
looking
for
a
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
402...
is
the
402a
seller
madruga?
because
i
think
one
possible--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--line...
what
about
a
possible
line
that
says
where
there
are
a
series
of
suppliers,
each
one
of
them
supplies
an
ingredient
to
a
product
that
ends
up
eventually
in
somebody's
hands,
the
it,
the
defective
thing
as
compared
to
the
other
property,
is
whatever
was
that
thing
in
its
form
when
it
last
left
the
hands
of
the
last
402a
seller.
that
would
work.
that's
very
generous
in
your
direction,
but
if
that
were
the
line,
i
don't
see
any
reason
for
drawing
a
line
beyond
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is.
there
is
the
defective
product,
and
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
get
a
definition
for
the
defective
product
compared
to
other
property
that
surrounds
the
defective
product,
and
i'm
suggesting
the
most
liberal
possible
definition
in
your
favor
would
be
the
defective
product
is
that
product
in
its
form
when
it
left
the
hands
of
the
last
402a
seller.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
limited
by
foreseeability
principles,
which
is
a
normal
tort
limitation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if...
i
wondered
if...
what's
bothering
me
basically
is,
i
thought
east
river's
like
this:
there's
a
glass
on
the
table
in
the
galley,
and
it's
defective,
and
it
cracks
and
breaks
and
people
are
cut,
and
there's
a
good
claim
that
of
course
all
these
cut
people
can
recover
in
tort,
and
then
somebody
says
i
also
want
tort
recovery
for
the
glass
itself.
you
say,
wait
a
minute.
when
you
have
a
defective
glass
you
don't
get
the
value
of
the
glass
in
tort.
i
mean,
it's
the
glass
that
was
defective.
recover
in
contract
or
warranty
for
the
defective
glass.
and
now
that
principle,
which
seems
right
in
that
case,
seems
to
have
gotten
way
out
of
control.
i
mean,
now
suddenly
we're
talking
about
they
have
to
recover
in
contract.
they
can't
get
a
tort
recovery
for
the
fish
that
are
hurt,
and
they...
all
these
other
things.
it
doesn't
seem
right
that
it's
so
far
out
of
control,
but
i'm
having
trouble
thinking
of
what
the
limiting
principle
is.
it
doesn't
seem
right
to
me
when
you
buy
a
ship,
under
all
these
other
appurtenance
things
there's
a
little
bit
of
a
glass
or
something
somewhere
that
breaks.
you
say
you
can't
get
recovery
in
tort
for
all
these
other
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
glass.
what's
the
line
you
draw?
