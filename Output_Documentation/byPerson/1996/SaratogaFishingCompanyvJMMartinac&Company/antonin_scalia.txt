justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
zakarin,
i'm
not
clear
as
to
whether
what
east
river
is
saying
is
that
the
manufacturer
has
the
opportunity
to
protect
himself
against
tort
liability
and,
therefore,
if
he
doesn't
he
should
be
socked,
or
rather
is
saying
that
the
purchaser
has
an
opportunity
to
protect
itself
against
injury
through
contract
and,
therefore,
if
he
doesn't
do
so
the
purchaser
should
not
be
given
the
tort
recovery.
now,
if
east
river
is
looking
to
the
purchaser
and
saying
look,
the
purchaser
could
have
put
this
in
the
contract,
then
logically
we
ought
to
look
to
the
second
contract
and
not
to
the
first
contract,
whereas
if
east
river
is
looking
to
the
seller,
then
you're
quite
correct,
we
ought
to
look
at
the
first
contract.
but
why
do
you
say
that
east
river
focuses
on
the
seller
rather
than
the
purchaser?
i
mean,
each
of
them
can
protect
themselves.
why
shouldn't
we
say,
look,
in
this
last
transaction
if
the
purchaser
wanted
to
be
able
to
recover
for
all
of
the
incidentals
besides
the
tuna,
he
could
have
put
it
in
the
contract.
he
didn't
do
it.
tough
luck.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
i'm
not
sure
what
point
you're
making.
are
you
making
the
point
that
the
immunity
that
the
manufacturer
had
acquired
for
itself
by
the
contract
could
be
undone
by
a
later
reseller?
is
that
the
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not
upon
purchasers?
i
mean,
you
know,
they're
both
in
this
together,
and
we're
only
dealing
with
situations
in
which
they're...
it's
arm's
length
between
people
of
comparable
bargaining
power.
we're
not
talking
about
the
purchase
of
a
bottle
of
pop
in
the
grocery
store,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
mean,
why
pick
on
the
manufacturer?
they're
both
grown-ups,
and
they
can
both
protect
themselves.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
the
case
where
the
engine
manufacturer
produces
his
own
screws.
i
guess
that
is
unusual.
i
think
justice
breyer
was
giving
you
the
case
where
there
are
screws
in
the
engine,
but
the
engine
manufacturer
gets
the
screw
from,
you
know--
--yes.
--screws
unlimited
or
something,
the
screw
manufacturer.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
a
commercial...
not
just
a
commercial
sale,
but
a
commercial
sale
to
an
end
user.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
how
you
decide
where
to
draw
the
line
between
the
screw
and
the
engine
and
the
ship.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
sale
was
a
sale
to
an
ultimate
user.
the
screw
was
not
sold
to
an
ultimate
user,
since
it
was
sold
to
a
manufacturer
of
an
engine.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
nifty
for
the
original
purchaser.
he
can
protect
himself.
but
the
original
seller
is
really
left
without
a
way
to
protect
himself.
i
guess
he
can
interrogate
the
original
purchaser
and
say,
are
you
going
to
be
the
last
end
user,
or
are
you
going
to
sell
to
somebody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
could
write
a
contractual
provision
that
says,
if
you
resell
the
ship,
or
whatever
i'm
selling
you,
you
will
be
liable
for
any
damaged
goods
that
i'm
held
liable
for
in
tort.
you
could
assume
that
contractually,
couldn't
you,
or
would
that
violate
public
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
zakarin,
what
is
magic
about
the
end
user?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
what's
magic
about
the
end
user
when
you're
talking
about
transactions
that
may
involve
unsophisticated
end
users...
the
pop
bottle
example.
but
once
you've
limited
the
rule
that
you're
concerned
with
to
sophisticated
buyers
and
sellers,
merchants,
people
in
commerce,
why
should
the
engine
manufacturer
not
be
able
to
get
the
cost
of
his
engine
from
the
screw
manufacturer,
but
the
fisherman
who
buys
the
whole
boat,
a
sophisticated
fisherman
who
has
seven
of
them,
who
sells
some
of
them
for
resale
later
on,
he
can
get
the
value
of
his
seines
and
other
equipment
added
on?
what's
so
magic
about
the
end
user?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
understand
you
say
that,
but
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
be
general
motors.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
manufacturer
can
protect
himself
against
the
increasing
liability
of
new
components
added
by
the
original
purchaser.
he
can
protect
himself
against
that
by
contract,
can
he
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
and
he
cannot
protect
himself
against
the
addition
of
new
components
by
someone
downstream.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
was
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question
correct,
that
the
original
seller
can
protect
himself
by
contract
against
tort
liability
for
other
property
added
by
the
original
purchaser?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
he
do
that?
what
does
a
contract
say,
there
shall
be
no
tort
liability
for
other
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we've
rejected
that.
i
mean,
we
have
accepted
that
even
out
of
a
contract
context
there
can
arise
tort
recovery.
i
mean,
we've
gone
beyond
what
you've
said.
that's
already
been
held.
what
you
want
to
do
is
simply
eliminate
the
basic
rule
that
a
tort
recovery
can
be
had
on
the
basis
of
a
transaction
that
was
a
contract.
isn't
that
what
you're
arguing?
your
sole
remedy
has
to
be
through
the
contract.
i
mean,
that's
not
even...
that's
not
even
up
for
debate.
we've
held
that.
and
not
only
that,
your
point
as
i
understand
it
is
the
sole
remedy
has
to
be
against
the
person
from
whom
you
made
the
purchase,
so
that
if
a
big
company
sells
the
ship
to
a
small
person
who
sells
it
to
a
third
party,
the
third
party
can
only
sue
the
small
person
who
may
not
be
able
to
pay
the
judgment,
but
the
person
who
manufactured
the
dangerous
item
is
scott-free,
under
your
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
but
if
it
was
a
personal
injury
of
the
buyer,
then
you'd
say,
tough
luck,
because
you
could
have
protected
yourself.
so
it's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
personal
injuries.
it's
just
personal
injuries
of
third
persons.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
acknowledge
that
the
recovery
for
the
skiff
and
the
recovery
for
the
personal
injury
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
souter
just
gave
you
would
be
tort
recovery
and
not
contract
recovery.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
contradicts
what
you
said
earlier.
that's
why
i
don't
really
understand
your
argument.
i
thought
that
this
was
what
you
were
saying
much
earlier
in
the
argument,
but
then
in
your
quite
recent
exchange
with
the
chief
justice
you
said
the
exclusive
recovery
is
under
the
contract.
you
don't
really
believe
that.
there
is
tort
recovery
in
some
instances.
