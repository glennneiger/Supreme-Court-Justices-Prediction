justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
two
questions,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
part
of
the
case?
if
the
injury
to
the
additional
equipment
had
occurred
while
the
original
purchaser
still
owned
it,
madruga,
would
you
have
been
liable
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
the
bargain
included
warranties
on
the
ship
itself
but
nothing
more,
and
then
you
add
the...
madruga
added
the
additional
equipment,
which
was
lost
in
the...
for
tortious
reasons.
would
your
client
be
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
now,
supposing
instead
of
madruga
selling
it
on
an
as-is
basis,
supposing
madruga
had
given
a
warranty
to
saratoga
covering
both
the
additional
equipment
and
the
original
ship,
so
that
saratoga
then
recovered
on
the
warranty
for
the
additional
equipment.
would
madruga
then
have
been
able
to
recover
over
against
you
for
precisely
the
same
loss
that
would
have
occurred
if
they'd
still
owned
the
ship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
madruga
then
would
be
the
person
who
suffered
the
loss,
but
it
would
have
been
by
paying
its
customer.
why
would
that...
why
should
that
loss
be
different
than
if
it
occurs
while
he
still
owns
the
ship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
your
suggestion
in
favor
of
contract.
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
manufacturer
is
protected
from
liability
as
soon
as
the
product
is
resold
regardless
of
the
terms
of
the
reseller's
bargain
with
his
customer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
talk
about
other
property.
this
is
other
property,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
other
property
added
to
the
property
he
sold.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
could
happen...
the
original
purchaser
could
keep
adding
things
to
the
ship,
but
that
would
still...
each
addition
to
the
ship
would
increase
the
exposure
of
the
manufacturer
for
greater
liability,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
--but
as
i
understand
you,
as
soon
as
the
ship
is
resold
that
exposure
is
extinguished,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
regardless
of
the
terms
of
the
bargain
between
the
first
purchaser
and
the
second
purchaser.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
have
been
covered
by
the
warranty
anyway,
because
it's
other
property.
your...
the
manufacturer
only
warrants
the
original
ship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there'd
be
no
warranty
recovery.
the
only
recovery
would
be
the
same
tort
recovery
as
if
they
had
happened
while
he
still
owned
the
ship.
he'd
say,
well,
i
have
suffered
this
loss
as
a
result
of
your
delivering
me
a
dangerous
product.
it's
not
loss
of
the
original
ship.
i
had
to
pay
out
this
money
to
a
third
party.
i
don't
know
why
it's
any
different
if
it's
a
purchaser
or
a
passenger.
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
position
is
you
look
entirely
to
the
intermediate
purchaser.
would
you
care
to
give
us
your
own
version?
[laughter]
