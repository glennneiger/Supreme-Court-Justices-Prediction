should
it
matter
at
all,
for
purposes
of
our
analysis,
that
when
the
ship
was
sold
it
was
incomplete
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
sold,
and
which
it
was
understood
that
everyone
was
going
to
use
it
for,
so
that
the
ship
was
kind
of...
in
a
way,
it
was
sort
of
a
component
that
really
wouldn't
be
of
any
use
to
tuna
fishing
until
it
was
outfitted
with
a
substantial
amount
of
further
equipment.
should
that
affect
our
view
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
one
definition
of
that
whether
or
not
the
first
user
added
the
equipment,
as
opposed
to
a
manufacturer
adding
the
equipment?
suppose,
for
instance,
leaving
apart
saratoga...
we
just
have
as
between
martinac
and
madruga...
the
manufacturer
had
designed
a
special
place
for
the
skiff,
and
he
designed
a
special
place
for
the
nets,
and
then
madruga
just
sailed
it
off
and
put
the
skiff
on
and
the
nets.
would
the
skiff
and
the
nets
then
be
part
of
the
whole
product
in
the
case
that
i
put?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
because
madruga
is
the
user,
and
the
user
added
the
parts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
that
madruga
is
not
in
the
business
of
making
engines
and
machines,
and
he's
not
even
in
the
business
of
reselling
boats.
he
happened
to
sell
this
one
boat.
is
that
the
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
madruga...
let's
assume
that
madruga
just
sold
one
vessel.
he
didn't
sell
seven
of
them.
if
he's
talking
to
saratoga
and
saratoga
says,
well,
i
want
a
warranty,
madruga
would
say,
you
know,
i
don't
know
anything
about
engines
and
boats.
i'm
a
fisherman.
i
don't
know
how
to
draw
a
warranty.
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
artificial
for
us
to
suggest
that
madruga
and
saratoga
were
well-positioned
to
design
and
to
negotiate
a
warranty.
madruga
doesn't
know
anything
about
ships
insofar
as
their
technical
manufacture,
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
added
a
turbocharger
unit
that
caused
the
ship
to
sink.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
this
just
goes
to
show
that
madruga
is
not
in
the
business
of
selling
vessels,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
may
cut
against
you.
