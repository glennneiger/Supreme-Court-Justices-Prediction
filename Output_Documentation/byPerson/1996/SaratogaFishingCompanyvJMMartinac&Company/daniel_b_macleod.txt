mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
situation,
a
commercial
business
entity
bargained
with
another
commercial
business
corporation
for
the
purchase
of
a
fully
outfitted,
totally
functional
purse
seiner.
that's
exactly
what
it
acquired.
it
operated
it
for
12
years,
and
that's
exactly
what
it
lost.
it
lost
the
benefit
of
its
own
bargain,
nothing
more
and
nothing
less.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
probably.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
approach
would
be
exactly
the
same,
that
the
examination
would
be
of
the
bargain
made
by--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
analysis
in
the
hands
of
mr.
madruga
would
be
the
analysis
under
the
contract
between
madruga's
business
corporation
and
j.
m.
martinac,
and
i
think
that
the
warranties
would
have
expired.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i
think
the
proper
focus
is
on
the
benefits
and
the
responsibilities
of
the
bargaining
of
the
commercial
contracting
parties,
and
if
mr.
madruga
chose
for
one
reason
or
another
to
extend
a
warranty
on
the
equipment
that
he
put
aboard,
or
extend
the
original
manufacturer's
warranty,
i
think
that's
mr.
madruga's
problem,
and
i
think
undoubtedly
he
would
be
compensated
for
it
in
the
purchase
price.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
actually
that
was
the
second
purchaser,
your
honor.
that
was
captain
vargas.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
that
turbocharger
uncovered.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
well,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
here
that
madruga
purchased
a
total
of
seven
vessels
from
j.
m.
martinac
which
were
ultimately
sold.
there
is
also
substantial
trial
testimony
concerning
the
fact
that
madruga
had
a
full-time
engineer
at
the
shipyard
during
the
entire
course
of
construction.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
that's
correct,
your
honor,
madruga
v.
superior
court
was
here
in
the
fifties,
and
he
was
one
of
the
parties
to
that
partition
of
a
vessel,
if
i
remember
correctly.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--i
think
the
focus
should
be
on
the
transaction
as
a
whole,
this
being
clearly
a
commercial
transaction,
whereas
a
business
corporation
transferring
assets
to
another
business
corporation,
and
as
i
read
east
river
and
understand
it,
the
public
policy
choice
to
be
made
is
the
choice
between
contract
and
tort,
and--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
the
test
is
the
benefit
of
the
bargain,
and
in
order
to
define
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
one
has
to
look
at
what
the
purchaser
purchased,
which
it
was
the
ultimate
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
there
is--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--well,
your
honor,
that
seems
to
assume
that
there's
a
sort
of
an
essential
platonic
product
that
we
can--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--the
application
of
that
rule
would
result
in
a
rather
con...
substantial
amount
of
confusion,
i
believe,
because
the
vessel...
a
vessel,
complex
products
in
the
normal
course
of
events,
undergo
modifications,
additions,
et
cetera,
and
if
the
vessel
is
modified
and
added
to
in
the
hands
of
subsequent
purchasers
on
down
the
line,
the
liability
of
the
manufacturer
of
that
product
increases
as
the
manufacturer's
involvement
becomes
more
remote
in
time.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
well,
yes.
i
think
the
public
policy
choice
there
was
made
in
east
river
in
favor
of
contract,
and
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--well,
the
manufacturer--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--the
manufacturer's
not
protected
from
liability
for
personal
injuries,
for
damages
to
other
property,
et
cetera.
he's
simply--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--i
suggest
the
manufacturer
is
insulated
from
liability
for...
for
the--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--yes.
to
do
otherwise
would
increase
the
manufacturer's
liability
with
the
passage
of
time.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
it
could
do,
yes.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
he
certainly
can,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
that
is
absolutely
correct.
there
was
also
a
balancing
test
suggested
in
the
products
liability
cases
in
the
consumer
context
to
the
extent
that
a
manufacturer
can,
with
very
slight
price
increases,
protect
himself
against
that
through
the
purchase
of
insurance,
and
i
suggest
that
that's
not
economically
available
in
the
context
of
a
manufacturer
of
a
vessel
where,
if
the
price
were
increased
to
accommodate
additional
insurance
the
shipyard
would
become--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--i
would...
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i'm
suggesting
that
replacement
property
is
not
recoverable
as
other
property,
where
parts
of
the
ship
wear
out
and
are
replaced
or...
and
modified
and
repaired
in
the
normal
course
of
operations,
for
the
same
reason,
that
we're
constantly
going
to
have
additions
and
modifications
and
repair
with
replacement
parts
being
added
to
a
vessel,
or
any
large
complex
piece
of
machinery.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
property
of
a
third
party,
or
property
if
mr.
vargas,
or
vargas'
corporation
which
was
unrelated
to
the
bargain
made
by
mr.
vargas.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes.
in
fact,
in
the
present
case
the
property
of
other
crewmen
that
was
aboard
the
vessel
is
other
property.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes,
it
was.
he
can
protect
himself
by
contract.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
the
builder
shan't
be
responsible
for
any
of
the
property
of
the
purchaser
that's
aboard
the
vessel.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i...
that's
not
my
position,
your
honor.
i
think
your
statement
is
exactly
correct,
and
exactly
why
we
should
be
looking
at
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
to
what
the
purchaser
acquired.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
in
the
hands
of
the
first
purchaser.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
but
not
in
the
hands
of
the
second
or
subsequent
purchasers.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes,
your
honor,
except
that
in
the
hands
of
the
second
purchaser
i
think
the
analysis
should
be
of
the
bargain
made
by
that
purchaser.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i
think
it
is,
and
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
contract
law.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i
don't
think
i
can
either.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i'm
suggesting
that
the
second
purchaser
purchased
a
warranty
from
mr.
madruga
in
the
initial
sale,
that
mr.
madruga
would
have
to
make
good
on
that
warranty.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
as
a
matter
of
contract
law.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i
believe
that
the
proper
analysis
of
the
relationship
between
mr.
madruga
and
the
shipbuilder
at
that
point
would
be
made
under
contract
and
warranty
law
with
an
examination
of
that
particular
contract
and,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
it
would
not
be
recoverable
in
this
case
because
of
a
time
limit
on
warranties.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
ah.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
that
would
be
assigning
a
tort
claim,
presumably...
actually
creating
a
tort
claim,
because
no
claim
existed
to
be
assigned.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes,
it
is.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i
believe--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--i
believe
that
the
proper
approach
is
contractual,
and
that
the
complete
analysis
should
be
made
in
contract
because
of
the
commercial
contract.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
that's
what
east
river
says.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i
don't
agree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
i
think...
no,
it
was
not
sold--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--but
i
believe--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
the
approach
that
was
taken
to
the
analysis
of
the
tuna
was
a
lost
profit
analysis,
and
i
think
that
lost
profits
are
derived
from
the
benefit
of
the
bargain,
and
that
what
was
actually
lost
here
was
an
expectancy,
which
is
the
equivalent
of
lost
products,
a
simple
consequential
economic
loss
flowing
from
the--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--it
was
still
necessary
that
that
catch
be
delivered,
and
the
catch...
the
catch
represents
an
expectancy
of
money.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
true.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
we
did.
we
petitioned
on
the...
several
liability
issues,
your
honor,
as
well
as
that.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
the
line
that
i
would
draw
would
be
the
object
of
the
plaintiff's
bargain,
what
the
plaintiff
bargained
for
and
got,
together
with
the
economic
loss
that
flows
from
the
loss
of
that
bargain.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
under
my
theory,
but
only
as
to
the
loss
of
the
product
and
the
economic
losses
that
flow
from
the
loss
of
the
product.
they
are
not
scott-free
as
to
personal
injuries
or
damages
to
property
of
a
third
party,
or--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--the
commercial
purchaser
in
the
commercial
context
can
protect
themselves,
whereas
the
injured
person
is
probably
suffering
a
personal
disaster
in
their
life
and
has
no
method
of
protecting
themselves
against
the
dangerous
product,
or
a
defective
product,
or
likely
any
knowledge
about
the
dangerous--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
no,
your
honor.
if
the
buyer
was
personally
injured...
the
human
being
buyer--
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
--contract
law...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
absolutely.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
and
i
would
foreclose
recovery
for
the
loss
of
that
thing,
whatever
it
is,
that's
the
object
of
the
bargain
and
the
economic
losses
that
flow
from
the
loss
of
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
or
the
destruction
of
that
thing.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
macleod
yes.
there
are
tort
recoveries
in
some
instances,
personal
injuries
being
the
prime
example.
thank
you,
your
honor.
