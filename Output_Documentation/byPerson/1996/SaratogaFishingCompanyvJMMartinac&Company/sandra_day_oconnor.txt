mr.
zakarin,
is
it
not
possible
in
contract
suit
to
recover
also
damages
for
property
that
it
is
clear
would
be
at
risk
if
the
item
sold
were
destroyed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
there's
some
leeway,
is
there
not,
under
a
contract
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
even
in
the
east
river
situation
where
you're
dealing
with
commercial
sellers,
if
you
would...
you
may
not
want
to
concede
that,
but
assuming
we're
dealing
with
a
commercial
seller
and
a
commercial
buyer,
does
east
river
indicate
that
a
contract
recovery,
if
it
were
available
for
these
other
things,
should
be
applied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
i
ask
about
the
circumstances
of
this
sale?
your
client,
saratoga,
bought
the
boat
with
certain
things
added
after
the
original
sale
of
the
boat
from
the
original
purchaser
of
the
boat,
madruga,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
could
saratoga
fishing
have
asked
for
certain
warranties
at
the
time
it
bought
from
madruga?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
apparently
it
didn't,
and
made
the
sale
on
an
as-is
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
any
implied
warranties
from
madruga
in
the
case
of
an
as-is
basis
sale?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
saratoga
had
insurance
for
loss
of
the
boat?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
conceivably
saratoga
paid
a
lesser
price
as
a
result
of
not
requiring
warranties
and
thought
it
could
do
so...
protect
itself
more
cheaply
by
just
getting
insurance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
east
river
represented,
as
has
been
suggested
in
other
questions
this
morning,
a
choice
that
in
the
commercial
context
we
will
focus
on
a
contract
remedy
because
the
commercial
buyer
is
able
to
protect
itself
by
demanding
warranties
if
it
sees
fit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
is
east
river,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
what
caused
the
damage
there
was
a
defective
component
that
east
river
didn't
produce
but
incorporated
in
the
equipment
that
was
sold.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
aren't
the
cases
pretty
much
uniform
in
saying
you
look
at
the
product
that
was
sold
the
first
time,
the
whole
entity,
not
at
the
component
parts
that
may
have
been
produced
by
someone
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
least
that's
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
normal
holding
of
the
courts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
a
quick
question?
you're
almost
out
of
time,
but
i'm
curious.
if
this
court
were
to
apply
the
contract
theory
rather
than
your
product
liability
theory
to
a
successive
purchase,
what
is
other
property?
would
it
include
the
tuna
catch?
would
it
include
the
fuel?
would
it
include
the
replacement
skiff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
replacement
skiff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
well,
east
river
says
other
property
may
still
be
recoverable
in
tort,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
east
river
theory,
what
do
we
really
look
to
first
and
foremost
in
applying
a
contract
theory
of
recovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
the
commercial
nature
of
the
purchaser,
or
to
the
commercial
nature
of
the
seller?
would
the
real
focus
be
on
whether
the
purchaser
is
in
a
commercial
business
of
acquiring
products
like
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
making
that
choice,
should
we
be
more
concerned
with
what
the
purchaser
might
suffer,
and
therefore
look
to
whether
the
purchaser
is,
indeed,
a
commercial
entity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wait
a
minute.
under
east
river
it
preserved
liability
in
tort,
product
liability
theory
for
other
property
loss.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
why
does
that
liability
disappear
in
the
event
the
ship
is
resold
and
the
original
purchaser
had
to
pay
damages
to
his
purchaser?
why
can't
he
look
back
to
the
original
manufacturer
for
those
losses
for
other
property
under
tort
liability,
assuming
the
statute
hasn't
run?
it
would
have
been
a
tort
theory
all
along,
and
it
just
stays
that
way.
let's
talk
about
the
tuna
catch.
that's
the
most
valuable
thing
in
this
whole
lawsuit,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
well,
let's
talk
about
the
tuna
catch,
because
that's
other
property
under
anybody's
definition,
and
if
the
original
buyer,
madruga,
has
to
fork
over
under
tort
theory
to
saratoga
for
the
loss
of
the
tuna,
then
why
can't
he
in
turn
look
back
to
the
manufacturer
for
that
loss.
i
think
you
say
he
can,
don't
you,
unless
there's
been
an
exclusion
of
that
in
the
original
contract.
no,
he
said
originally
he
could
not.
that's
his
position,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
east
river
it
is
not
contractual
recovery
as
to
other
property.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
tuna
is
other
property.
don't
we
all
agree
with
that...
the
catch?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
you
don't?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
wasn't
sold
originally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
the
manufacturer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
something
that
was
caught--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--by
the
original
buyer,
and
i
would
have
thought
surely
that
was
other
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
fish
had
been
caught
and
put
in
the
hold.
that's
other
property.
it's
not
an
expectancy.
they
caught
the
fish,
and
they're
worth
something.
