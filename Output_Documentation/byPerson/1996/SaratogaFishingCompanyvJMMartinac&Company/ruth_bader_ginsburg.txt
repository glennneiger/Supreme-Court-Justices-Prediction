justice

bader

suppose
it
was
his
business
to
convert
bare
boats
into
tuna
boats
and
he
did
that
in
quantity?
here
there
were
about
seven
boats,
was
it
not
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
whatever
madruga...
was
other
property
in
madruga's
hands
stays
other
property
vis-a-vis
the
manufacturer
no
matter
how
many
subsequent
sales
there
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
as
long
as...
madruga
could
have
recovered
had
there
been...
for
the
additional
things,
and
anyone
forthwith,
no
matter
how
much
is
added
onto
the
boat.
the
original
product
is
what
the
manufacturer
is
insulated
for
and
nothing
that
anyone
else
adds
to
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't...
as
far
as
the
condition
of
the
boat,
captain
vargas
probably
knew
more
about
that
boat
than...
and
he
probably
knew
about
the
defective
hydraulic
system--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
he
bought
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your--
--mr.
macleod,
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
because
i
didn't
understand
you
to
be
contesting
that
if
vargas,
the
second
purchaser,
bought
all
new
equipment,
a
new
seine,
a
new
boat,
that
would
be
other
property,
would
it
not,
for
which
the
manufacturer
would
be
liable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there's
nothing
that...
as
part
of
the
boat
that
vargas
puts
on
that
the
manufacturer...
that
would
constitute
other
property
vis-a-vis
the
manufacturer,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
could...
what
would
constitute
other
property
vis-a-vis
the
manufacturer
as
far
as
the
vessel
that
vargas
is
operating
is
concerned?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
mr.
macleod,
is
the
response
you
gave
to
justice
stevens
before,
is
that
settled
law,
that
if
there
is
a
contract
running
between
madruga
and
vargas,
a
warranty,
and
madruga
pays,
that
madruga
could
not
go
back
against
the
manufacturer
for
the...
what
would
have
been
other
property
in
madruga's
ownership
period?
is
that
settled?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was...
there
was
a
tort
liability--
--i
don't
think
you
can
give
me
a
case
for
that
proposition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
now
the
question
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
he
turn
around
and
get
back
from
the
manufacturer
the
extent
to
which
the
warranty
covered
what
would
have
been
other
property
in
madruga's
hands?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
petition
on
that
question
and
we
didn't...
we
didn't
grant
it,
right,
on
the
fish?
