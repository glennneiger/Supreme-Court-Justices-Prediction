h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1764,
saratoga
fishing
company
v.
j.
m.
martinac
&
company.
mr.
zakarin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
east
river
meant
to
not
go
as
far
as,
say,
hadley
v.
baxendale
would?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
hadley
v.
baxendale,
too,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
a
more
relaxed
standard
of
foreseeability,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zakarin.
mr.
macleod,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
madruga
had
a
case
here
in
the
fifties.
he's
not
an
unknown
person
in
maritime
transactions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
shouldn't
bind
people
further
downstream.
i
don't
think
you
can
by
contract
restrict
tort
liability
for
people
who
aren't
parties
to
the
contract.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
had
said
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
that
the
purchaser
could...
the
manufacturer
could
protect
himself
from
liability,
tort
liability
simply
by
contracting
with
the
purchaser.
you
don't
mean--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
all
you're
contracting
for
is
no
tort
liability
as
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
first
purchaser.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
petition--
--yes,
but
if
the
boat
hadn't
broken
down
they
would
have
been
delivered.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
for
damages
to
property
in
a
case
like
this
and
damage...
personal
injuries?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
macleod.
the
case
is
submitted.
