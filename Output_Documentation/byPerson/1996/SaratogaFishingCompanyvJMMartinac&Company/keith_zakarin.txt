mr.
keith
zakarin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
task
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
to
now
make
explicit
what
east
river
requires
but
necessarily
left
implicit,
a
definition
of
the
product
itself
which
is
true
to
the
principles
of
east
river
and
is
capable
of
uniform
application
by
the
federal
courts
sitting
in
admiralty.
the
product
itself
is
the
thing
sold
by
the
original
seller
or
manufacturer
to
the
original
buyer
of
that
thing.
if
that
product
self-destructs,
its
loss
can
only
be
recovered
in
contract.
east
river
teaches
so.
property
destroyed
by
the
defect
which
is
not
the
product
itself
is
recoverable
in
tort.
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
final
opinion,
the
last
of
three,
has
damaged
that
balance,
and
that
balance
must
now
be
set
aright.
mr.
keith
zakarin
justice
o'connor--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--justice
o'connor,
that
depends,
of
course,
upon
the
existence
both
of
privity
and
the
scope
of
the
contract
at
issue.
there
may
or
may
not
be
privity
and
there
may
or
may
not
be
recovery.
nevertheless,
the
principles
which
drive
the
existence
of
strict
liability,
the
necessity
to
make
manufacturers
responsible
to
produce
safe
goods
put
into
the
stream
of
commerce,
counsel
a
broader
interpretation
of
recovery.
mr.
keith
zakarin
ordinarily,
the
answer
is...
the
answer
is
that
east
river
is
silent
as
to
the
recovery
in
a
particular
contract
of
those
items.
it
may
be,
under
hadley
v.
baxendale
and
cases
in
particular
state
jurisdictions,
that
a
contract
could
permit
broader
recovery
than
for
the
item
itself,
governed,
of
course,
by
the
doctrine
of
foreseeability.
nevertheless,
east
river
speaks
to
a
limitation
and
a
balance
between
tort
and
contract
which
permit
tort
recovery
for
those
other
items
where
contract
does
not
permit
it.
mr.
keith
zakarin
the
standards
for
recovery
of
damages
are
different
in
tort
and
in
contract,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
east
river
necessarily
sets
those
parameters.
east
river
does
say
quite
correctly
that
recovery
in
contract
will
be
governed
by
foreseeability
as
to
those
items
governed
by
contract,
the
product
itself.
mr.
keith
zakarin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
keith
zakarin
but
that
is,
of
course,
the
measure
of
contract
recovery
and
not
of
tort
recovery.
tort
recovery
is
necessarily
those
things...
those
damages
proximately
caused
by
the
defect.
in
this
case--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
indeed,
but
that
relaxed
standard
is
important
in
the
area
of
unreasonably
dangerous
and
defective
products,
since
the
manufacturer
may
not
always
be
able
to
foresee,
unlike
a
contracting
party,
the
scope
of
damage
that
its
product
may
cause.
mr.
keith
zakarin
no,
justice
souter,
it
should
not.
the
product
as
it
left
the
martinac
shipyard
with
the
marco
hydraulic
system
aboard
was
a
fully
complete
ship,
admittedly
not
complete
for
the
purpose
it
had
eventually
been
intended,
tuna
purse
seine
fishing,
but
she
was
capable
of
sailing
away,
and
did
sail
away.
were
that
distinction
of
a
changing
product
adopted
by
the
court,
the
balance
given
to
us
by
east
river...
that
is
that
the
object
of
the
bargain
between
the
original
manufacturer
and/or
seller,
as
it
were,
and
the
original
buyer
would
be
disturbed...
the
product
would
change
as
each
went
on,
and
the
original
focus
upon
the
object
of
the
contract
would
become
diluted
over
time.
mr.
keith
zakarin
there
are
two
reasons,
justice
scalia,
why
that
would
be
the
wrong
focus.
for
one
thing,
east
river
is
not
a
singular
focus
upon
the
ability
of
the
manufacturer,
as
you
correctly
point
out,
to
protect
itself,
but
it
also
looks
to,
as
you
also
correctly
point
out,
the
buyer's
ability
to
negotiate
for
additional
warranties
and
the
like,
and
that
balance
is
respected
in
east
river.
however,
if
that
object
of
the
contract
is...
if
we
look
to
subsequent
sales,
the
object
of
that
contract
becomes
ignored.
therefore,
looking
at
the
downstream
sales
and
looking
at
what
protections
the
purchasers
in
those
sales
made
or
didn't
make
is
an
unrelated
proposition
to
the
balance
in
east
river
between
the
original
purchaser
and
the
original
buyer.
but
there's
another
reason,
which
is
that--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--no,
your
honor.
under
the--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--well,
that
is
the
point...
that
is
the
point
i
am
making.
the
original
purchase
provides
an
immunity
for
the
product
sold.
if
that
immunity
is
expanded,
the
expansion
of
that
immunity
bears
no
relation
to
the
original
object
of
the
contract
and
is
in
effect
a
windfall
for
that
manufacturer
for
immunity
it
never
bargained
for,
never
was
paid
for,
and
never
discussed.
but
looking
beyond
that,
east
river
is
not
a
singular
focus
upon
contract
but
also
recognizes
the
important
necessities
driving
the
tort
system,
which
is
the
place
of
proper
encouragement
upon
manufacturers
to
foresee,
spread,
and
control
the
risk.
if--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--that's
true.
mr.
keith
zakarin
the
proposed
rule
that
we
advance
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
manufacturer
being
able
to
protect
itself
in
that
instance.
by
respecting
the
product,
tort
immunity
for
the
product
itself,
that
particular
balance
is
respected.
however,
absurd
results
would
obtain
if
we
focus
on
continuing
purchases
down
the
line.
mr.
keith
zakarin
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
keith
zakarin
of
course
it
could
have.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
zakarin
i
would
believe
not.
no
contractual
warranties,
it
is
admitted,
were
extended,
granted,
or
received
by
captain
vargas
through
saratoga
fishing
company.
mr.
keith
zakarin
sara...
there
are
references
to
insurance
in
the
record.
it
is
uncontested
that
saratoga
did
have
insurance,
though
the
subrogation
was
not
total.
it
was--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--of
course.
mr.
keith
zakarin
the
existence...
the
existence
of
an
as-is
sale
in
a
downstream
transaction,
which
is
as-is,
where-is,
is
not
hostile
to
the
balance
struck
in
east
river
of
holding
manufacturers
strictly
liable
for
unreasonably
dangerous
defects.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that
is
only,
justice
o'connor,
if
we
allow
the
focus
of
the
bargain
to
shift
with
each
subsequent
sale.
east
river,
again,
is
not
a
singular--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--focus
upon
contract,
but
a
balance
between
contract
and
tort.
mr.
keith
zakarin
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
hypothetical.
the
screw--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--and
the
screw
is
part
of
the
original
engine?
mr.
keith
zakarin
i
quite
agree,
justice
breyer,
that
the...
in
english,
the
rule
would
be
that
the
completed
product
as
first
placed
into
the
stream
of
commerce
in
a
commercial
sale
would
be
the
product--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--as
i
understood
your
hypothetical,
the
screws
as
sold
to
the
first
buyer
was
in
an
engine
contained
in
a
ship
which
all
went
in
a
completed
product
to
the
first
buyer.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that's
the
shipco
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that's
right.
that,
indeed,
is
both
in
microcosm
and
in
gross
the
east
river
case
and
the
shipco
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
keith
zakarin
east
river--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--that's
correct.
mr.
keith
zakarin
absolutely.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that's--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--east
river
necessarily
did
not
address
the
case
that...
the
facts
that
shipco
later
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
did
address
and
answered
the
question
put
by
justice
breyer.
mr.
keith
zakarin
the
engine--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--the
engine
under
our
theory
would
most
certainly
be
part
of
the
component
ship.
the
ship
as
originally
delivered
into
the
stream
of
commerce
with
every
widget,
screw,
wire,
and
fastener
aboard,
is
that
product
originally
placed
into
the
stream
of
commerce.
mr.
keith
zakarin
because--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--i
respectfully--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--disagree,
justice
breyer.
the...
we
have
to
look
at
the
first
commercial
sale
and
what
fully
completed
product
was
delivered
out
into
that
commercial
sale.
in
the
saratoga
case,
as
justice
o'connor
focused
us
upon,
the
product
was
the
completed
product
with
all
the
widgets,
screws,
and
wires
that
came
out
of
the
martinac
shipyard.
that
was
the
object
of
that
original
bargain.
mr.
keith
zakarin
it
would
not
be.
if
the
skiff
and
the
nets
were
purchased
separately
by
madruga--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--quite
correct.
the--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--madruga.
mr.
keith
zakarin
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
record.
mr.
keith
zakarin
simply
put,
he's
not--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--simply
put,
he's
not
a
402a
seller.
strict
liability
does
not
apply
under
402a,
which
the
court
has
given
us
as
the
standard
in
admiralty
for
product
liability
between
casual
sales
or
occasional
sales.
it
focuses
on
commercial
sales
by
manufacturer--
mr.
keith
zakarin
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
that
would...
although
that
might
create
liability
if
madruga
turned
out
to
be
a
402a
seller
from
running
to
saratoga
fishing
company,
it
would
not
vitiate
liability
as
against
martinac,
another
seller
in
the
chain
of
distribution.
the
product
vis...
in
any
lawsuit
for
product
liability
between
parties
a
and
b
may
involve,
indeed,
a
different
product,
but
the
rule...
and
it's
important
to
have
a
uniform
rule,
is
merely
to
find
the
product
sold
by
that
manufacturer
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
in
our
case,
the
product
we
contend
was
the
complete
ship
with
everything
aboard,
as
the
shipco
case
teaches
us,
as
it
left
the
martinac
shipyard.
if,
later
on,
a
defective
heat
tape
or
some
other
product
had
been
added
aboard,
a
completely
different
engine,
some
new
machinery
had
been
put
aboard
and
had
caught
fire,
and
had
destroyed
the
vessel,
that
comp...
that
additional
equipment
manufacturer
would
have
tort
immunity
for
that
engine,
widget,
whatever
it
was
that
was
sold,
would
not
be
able
to
get
recovery
of
that
product
itself
from
that
manufacturer,
but
would
be
liable
for
the
hull
and
all
the
rest
of
the
goods.
it
may
be
in
every
instance,
because
every
lawsuit
is
necessarily
between
two
or
more
parties,
that
we
focus
on
a
somewhat
different
product,
but
it
doesn't
make
the
rule
difficult
to
apply,
because
we
look
at
the
bargain
between
that
manufacturer
in
its
original
sale
and
the
purchaser
in
that
original
sale,
assuming
that
it
is
a
commercial
sale,
not
a
casual
sale.
mr.
keith
zakarin
--yes.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
zakarin
you're
quite
correct,
justice
scalia.
in
fact,
as
i
referred
to
the
shipco
case,
here
was
an
attempt
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
illustrative,
an
attempt
to
get
the
component
manufacturer
for
a
part
that
they
had
put
in
the
engine,
and
that
was
a
specific
end
around,
as
it
were,
the
east
river,
and
the
fifth
circuit
stopped
it
cold
and
said
no,
it
is
the
negotiated,
final,
complete
product
that
left
that
particular
shipyard
which
is
the
product
itself,
and
there
was
no
property
in
that
particular
case
outside
of
that.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that
is
correct,
though
i
assume
you
don't
mean
the
capacity
to
contract.
i
assume
you
mean,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
original
contract?
is
it
a
commercial
sale
into
the
stream
of
commerce?
mr.
keith
zakarin
it
is
indeed
irrelevant
for
this
purpose,
because
strict
liability
in
its
balance
in
contract
as
given
by
east
river
takes
account
of
both.
it
looks
at
the
original
purchaser's
ability
to
contract
with
the
manufacturer,
what
warranties
might
exist.
in
other
words,
recovery
for
the
product
itself
might
be
permitted
in
warranty.
a
warranty
might
be
assignable,
transferable
and
the
like.
but
it
also
takes
account
quite
correctly
of
the
purposes
of
product
liability
to
impose
a
duty
upon
manufacturers--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--to
design
and
produce
safe
products.
mr.
keith
zakarin
the
original
purchaser
can
protect
itself
under
warranty,
obviously,
by
putting
restrictions
as
to
the
original
purchaser,
but
cannot
protect
itself
against
tort
liability
for
damage
to
other
property,
damage
downstream,
except
by
designing
safe,
reliable,
and
not
unreasonably
damaged
goods.
mr.
keith
zakarin
i
suspect
that
would
violate
public
policy,
justice
scalia,
but
it
certainly
is
possible
in
the
hands
of
the
first
purchaser,
vis-a-vis
a
red
letter
clause
or
some
other
device,
to
limit
tort
liability
to
the
original
buyer,
and
that's
done
fairly
conventionally.
the--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
keith
zakarin
i
would
suggest
that
the
best
focus
would
be
what
did
the
manufacturer
sell
as
a
completed
product?
anything
beyond
that
in
the
hands
of
the
ultimate
consumer,
when
a
product--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--shows
up
in
other
property.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that's
east
river.
mr.
keith
zakarin
assuming
it
was
an
admiralty
case,
and
assuming--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--right.
mr.
keith
zakarin
so--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
breyer.
it
is
not
a
flaky
line
at
all.
if
we
have
an...
if
i
am
an
ultimate
consumer,
whatever
i
bought
from
the
manufacturer
is
the
thing
itself.
mr.
keith
zakarin
in
your
hypothetical
the
screw
which
was
defective
came
with
the
engine?
mr.
keith
zakarin
then
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
zakarin
if
i'm
understanding
your
question--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--it
is
certainly
part
of
the
answer.
the...
whether
madruga
could
have
liability
to
vargas
is
a
separate
question,
of
course,
from
whether
martinac
may
have
liability
to
the
downstream
consumer.
the
product
itself
in
madruga's
hands
was
the
ship
as
it
left
the
martinac
shipyard
with
all
the
screws
and
widgets
aboard.
there's...
that's
an
easy
line
to
determine.
it's
easy
in
theory,
anyway.
the
trial
of
such
a
case
is
necessarily
complicated,
as
i
can
personally
vouch
for,
because
one
has
to
have
lists
of
all
the
things
that
were
aboard,
but
in
a
sophisticated
commercial
transaction,
that's
done.
mr.
keith
zakarin
the
end
user
is
sought
to
be
protected
by
the
law
of
product
liability,
the
ultimate
consumer.
that
is
the
intent--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--well,
i
suppose
that
the
distinction
might
be
that
a
sophisticated
consumer
was
capable
of
a
greater
level
of
inspection
to
detect
manufacturing
or
design
defects,
and
therefore
perhaps
could
enjoy
a
lesser
protection,
but
that
standard
would
be
very
difficult
to
draw
in
reality.
it
would
be
hard
to
determine
whether
any
particular
user
was
so
sophisticated
that
they
would
not
get
the
benefit
of
402a's
focus
upon
the
ultimate
consumer.
the
simpler
rule,
and
simplicity
in
application
given
the
uniformity
of
admiralty,
is
important,
is
to
pick
a
line,
the
ultimate
consumer,
the
user,
and
a
user
could
be
a
user
of
a
machine,
for
example,
in
a
machine
shop.
mr.
keith
zakarin
general
motors
could
be
an
ultimate
consumer,
but
the
chances
are
in
a
relationship
of
that
type
we
wouldn't
be
talking
about
a
single
screw.
we'd
be
talking
about
a
fairly
sophisticated
transaction
with
tort
remedies
and
the
like.
we're
talking
about
downstream
purchasers
here.
saratoga
was
certainly
not
a
sophisticated
fishing
entity,
as
the
contributory
negligence
findings
of
the
district
court
show
us.
this
was--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--he
certainly
did.
mr.
keith
zakarin
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
but
the...
we
do
not
place
in
product
liability
law
the
burden
upon
the
ultimate
consumer
to
redesign
or
inspect
products
for
design
defect,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
keith
zakarin
it
certainly
would
include
the
fish.
i
believe
it
would
include
the
fuel,
unless
you
say
fuel
is
a
fungible
item
and
therefore
is
the
same
no
matter
what.
that
would
be
the
recovery
under
those
circumstances,
but
again,
employing
a
contract--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--the
replacement
skiff
was
a
different
skiff
than
madruga
got,
but
i
believe--
mr.
keith
zakarin
--i
believe
it
was
replaced
in
the
hands
of
vargas,
and
that's
correct,
but
to
conclude
on
that,
using
a
contract
analysis
to
determine
the
product
itself
is
not
hostile
to
the
application
of
strict
products
liability
for
property
not
sold
by
that
manufacturer.
under
the
balance
given
to
us
by
east
river,
they
live
in
harmony
with
one
another,
assuming
a
line
can
be
given
to
determine
what
is
the
product,
and
that
product
is
that
sold
into
the
stream
of
commerce.
mr.
keith
zakarin
yes,
justice
o'connor.
thank
you.
