justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
williams,
in
the
cruzan
case,
the
court
recognized
a
liberty
interest
and
yet
it
upheld
restrictive
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
couldn't
one
take
the
same
approach
here,
there
is
a
liberty
interest,
but
because
of
the
risks
and
dangers
involved,
considerable
state
regulation
is
permissible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
bottom
line
of
cruzan
was
to
uphold
precisely
what
the
state
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
australian,
wasn't
there
something
about
australian
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
indeed
it
was...
whatever
the
legal
status
of
the
netherlands,
but
courts
elsewhere
don't
have
the
kind
of
constitutional
review
that
we
do
either.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
has
there
been
a
lot
in
the
briefs
about
the
netherlands
experience,
there
is
this
limited
legislation
in
australia.
has
there
been
any
evidence
about
what's
going
on
under
that
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dellinger,
now
or
ever,
because
this
case
raises
that
very
basic
question
of
who
decides.
and
is
it
simply
a
question
of
waiting
for
more
experience
abroad
or
in
oregon
or
is
it...
but,
what
is
your
position?
is
this
ever
a
proper
question
for
courts
as
opposed
to
legislatures
to
decide?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
tucker,
you...
you...
you
said
on
one
end
of
it
that
it's
got
to
be
the
terminal
point
of
life,
however
one
defines
soon
to
die.
and
that's
not
as
clear.
but
what
about
the
person
who
is
in
such
agony
that
that
person
is
not
able
to
assist
in
her
own
suicide
so
she
needs
the
doctor
or
the
nurse
to
administer
the
lethal
dose.
isn't
that
person
in
a
more
sympathetic
situation
than
the
one
you're
describing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
this
person.
i'm
in
agony,
but
i
just
can't
do
it
myself,
please
do
it
for
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wants
it
and
six
psychiatrists
will
swear
that
that's
the
mental
state
of
that
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
we
believe
everything
that
you
said,
it
seems
to
me,
could
go
on
in
a
legislative
chamber.
where
should
we
draw
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process
you
include
the
person
who
is
able
to
take
the
pill
herself
but
exclude
the
one
whose
mental
state
is
the
same?
i
don't
understand
how
you
get
that
line
out
of
a
grand
due
process
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
tucker,
may
i
ask
you
just
to
qualify
one
thing.
you
said
formed
over
a
lifetime.
that's
surely
not
part
of
your
calculus,
it
could
be
someone
who
never
thought
a
moment
about
this
but
is
in
terrible
agony
and
would
fit
your
terminal
illness
category.
and
i
thought
that
the
question
justice
souter
was
asking
you
was
isn't
it
possible
that
such
a
person
could
at
one
time,
even
for
a
period
of
days,
say
i
want
to
die,
i
want
to
die,
and
didn't
get
the
assistance,
lives
on,
and
says
i'm
glad
that
i
didn't
do
that,
just
like
mistakes
are
made
about
people
who
commit
crimes,
isn't
there
the
possibility
of
a
person
saying,
gee,
i
really
thought
i
wanted
it
yesterday,
but
today
i
don't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
another
thing
too,
you're
talking
about
all
these
regulations,
very
tight
regulations
for
most
liberty
interests,
we
think
of
them
as
being
free,
not...
and
then,
if
you're
asking
a
court
to
declare
the
interests,
who
is
then
to
make
all
these
regulations?
the
waiting
period
and
what
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and,
ms.
tucker,
isn't
it
true
that
maybe
the
individual
hasn't
thought
about
it,
but
most
of
us
have
parents
or
other
loved
ones
and
we've
lived
through
a
dying
experience
that
forces
us
to
think
about
these
things.
and
so
the
large
question
of...
why
isn't
age
considered
the
same
kind
of
suspect
classification
as
race.
well,
because
we
were
all
once
young,
we
hope
we
will
be
old,
it's
universal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
way
to
upholding
the
choice
that
the
state
made
about
how
it
wished
to
regulate
this
particular
matter--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that's
what
makes
this
case
worlds
different
from
cruzan.
the
court
was
explaining
what
the
legislature
had
done
and
why
it
was
reasonable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
focus
of
the
legislature.
and
this
court
said,
yes,
the
legislature
did
right,
they
recognized
a
liberty
interest
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
but
they
put
conditions
on
it.
and
we
say
that
what
the
legislature
did
was
all
right.
i
don't
see
how
that
is
at
all
helpful
when
you
are
asking
the
court
not
to
approve
what
the
legislature
did
and
explain
what
the
legislature
did
to
the
public,
maybe
better
than
the
public
might
have
known
without
the
court's
decision.
instead
you
are
asking
to
overturn
the
laws
of,
now,
all
states
but
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
only
for
this
narrow
class.
because
if
you
describe
those
as
a
lot
of
people
would
fit
the
category,
but
you
say
there
are
these
interests
but
we
are
going
to
draw
the
line
at
which
we
recognize
these
interests
for
this
terminally
ill
group.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
do
you
get...
leave
out
the
rest
of
the
world
who
would
fit
the
same
standards?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
any
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
someone
can
withdraw
treatment
or
refuse
treatment
at
age
16
as
well
as
at
age
96,
isn't
that
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
mean
i
can't
refuse
treatment
in
the
state
of
washington?
i
don't
want
a
blood
transfusion.
i
have
to
get
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
of
the...
any
of
the
international
human
rights
documents
or
regional
human
rights
documents,
there
is
recognition
of
what
has
been
called
the
right
to
die
or,
as
described
today,
for
the
terminally
ill?
