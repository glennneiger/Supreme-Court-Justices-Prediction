i
suppose
that
proclaiming
a
liberty
interest
is
cost-free
so
long
as
you
can
proclaim
them
and
then
say,
however
they
can
be
outweighed
by
various
social
policies
adopted
by
the
states.
we
can
say
there's
a
liberty
interest
in
murdering
people,
however
it's
outweighed
by
the
state's
interest
in
preserving
the
lives
of
its'
citizens.
i
guess
we
could
do
that,
couldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dellinger,
we've
always
had
such
laws
and
you
go
back
as
far
as
blackstone
and
find
blackstone
saying
that
suicide
is
not
excused
even
when
committed,
quote,
to
avoid
those
ills
which
persons
had
not
the
fortitude
to
endure.
when
is
it
that
you
suppose
this
liberty
interest
that
didn't
used
to
exist
sprang
into
existence?
when?
1963?
what
year
do
you
think
it...
it
came
to
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
1790?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with...
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
suicide,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
a
continuous
tradition
in
our
society,
if
not,
indeed,
in
all
western
society
against...
against
suicide.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say...
you
say
only
if
we
agree
with
the
states,
you
say
there
is
a
liberty
interest
which...
which...
which
tosses
the
whole
matter
into
this
court
so
that
it's
up
to
us
to
decide
whether
indeed
the
states
are
right
or
wrong
that
this
is
a
dangerous
practice.
and,
if
we
think
they're
wrong,
then...
then
the
liberty
interest
must
prevail.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
consequence
of
recognizing
the
literate.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
tucker,
why...
why
is
it
limited
to
those
on
the
threshold
of
death?
i
mean
suppose
i
have,
you
know,
terrible
pain
and
the
doctor
says
you're
going
to
be
in
terrible
pain
for
ten
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
i
have
the
right
to
suicide.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hate
to
tell
you,
but
the
dying
process
of
all
of
us
has
begun
and
is
underway.
it's
just
a
matter
of
time.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
patient
who
has
ten
years
of
agony
to
look
forward
to
has
a
more
appealing
case
than
the
patient
who
is
at
the
threshold
of
death.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
that
decision,
if
it's
competent,
reasoned,
and
deliberated,
why
should
it
be
limited
to
physical
pain?
what...
what
about
the
patient
who
has
terrible
emotional
suffering
in
life
and
just
says
life
is
not
worth
it
anymore?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
not
allow
assisted
suicide
in
that
case,
i
take
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
because
we
make
some...
the
government
makes
the
judgment
that
physical
pain
is
worse
than
emotional
suffering?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
have
to
be
unstable
to
think
that
your
life
is
not
worth
living,
do
you?
or
is
the
government
going
to
make
that
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
mental
competence
and
assume
a
patient
who
is
thoroughly
mentally
competent,
is
not
at
the
threshold
of
death,
is
not
in
physical
pain,
but
does
not
want
to
live
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
asking,
why
you...
how
can
you
limit
the
choice
you're
presenting
to
us
to
the
physical
pain
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
willing
to
have
the
government
impose
that
judgement,
even
though
the
patient
says
these
emotional
scars
will
never
heal.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i've
tried
it
for
ten
years,
i
want
out;
you're
willing
to
let
the
government
make
that
judgment
for
the
person,
but
not
willing
to
make
the
judgment
that
your...
your
physical
pain
is...
is
not
as
harmful
as
a
few
more
years
of
life
would
be.
you're
not
willing
to
let
the
state
make
that
judgment,
but
you
will
let
the
state
make
the
judgment,
your
emotional
pain
is
not
important
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
presumably
the
majority
disagrees
with
you
about
that?
i
mean,
if
you're
right
about
that
scientific
analysis,
it's
contrary
to
what
the
majority
feels.
and
why
shouldn't
we
follow
the
majority?
justice
antonin
scalia
declining
medical
treatment
is
something
quite
different
from
suicide.
in
saying
you
have
a
right
not
to
have
your
body
invaded,
if
you
choose
not
to
receive
it,
you're
following
a
common-law
tradition
that
goes
all
the
way
back.
you're
opposing
a
common-law
tradition
when
you
say
there
is
a
right
to
kill
yourself.
why
can't
a
society
simply
determine
as
a
matter
of
public
morality
that
it
is
wrong
to
kill
yourself
just
as
it
is
wrong
to
kill
someone
else.
what
in
the
constitution
prevents
that
moral
judgment
from
being
made
in
this
society's
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
religious
decision
which
tells
you
to
do
all
sorts
of
unlawful
acts
by
reason
of
your
religious
conviction,
those
are
intensely
personal
as
well.
we
don't
change
the
law
on
that
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
an
intensely
personal
decision?
i
don't
know
how
it
becomes
an
intensely
personal
decision,
you
know,
within
a
short
time
of
death
and
it's
not
an
intensely
personal
decision
elsewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see...
i
don't
see
how
you
can
separate
out
the
two
situations
and
say
the
state
is
entitled
to
impose
its
will
despite
the
preferences
of
the
individual
at
one
stage
and
with
respect
to
some
pain
and
suffering,
namely
physical,
but
is
not
entitled
to
do
it
then,
but
is
entitled
to
do
it
in
other
situations,
when
the
person
has
emotional
trauma
or
when
the
person
is
further
away
from
death.
it
seems
to
me
in
both
cases
it
is
an
intensely
personal
decision
and
if
you
want
to
leave
it
to
the
individual,
your
argument
should
be
much
broader
than
what
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
aware
of
anybody
ever
having
been
prosecuted
for
attempted
suicide,
which
is
unlawful
in
some
states?
i
mean,
assuming
suicide,
you
know,
early
in
life,
not
later.
i
know
it's
unlawful,
i
don't
know
anybody
who
has
ever
been
prosecuted
for
it.
