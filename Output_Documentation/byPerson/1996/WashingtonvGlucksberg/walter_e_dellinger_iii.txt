mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
liberty
interest
we
would
recognize,
however,
unlike
the
argument
made
by
respondents
is
not
a
liberty
interest
in
dying.
we
recognize
the
existence
of
a
liberty
interest
because,
on
a
careful
reading
of
the
complaints
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
allege
that
they
were
undergoing
severe
pain
and
suffering.
and
the
state
had
a
rule
which
prevented
them
from
the
means
of
relieving
that
pain
and
suffering.
narrowly
conceived,
we
believe
that
that
state's...
the
kind
of
liberty
interest
that,
while
not
fundamental,
while
not
even
as
strong
as
the
liberty
interest
in
cruzan,
nonetheless
is
not
the
ordinary
liberty
interest
of
shifting
commercial
arrangements,
where
a
state
merely
need
have
a
plausible--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--we
urge
you
to
acknowledge,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
think
it's
not
critical
to
the
case,
but
we
urge
you
to
acknowledge
that
a
person
states
a
cognizable
liberty
interest
when
he
or
she
alleges
that
the
state
is
imposing
severe
pain
and
suffering
or
has
adopted
a
rule
which
prevents
someone
from
the
only
means
of
relieving
that
pain
and
suffering.
this
is
a
narrow
liberty
interest,
but
it's...
and
it's...
and
it's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
we
do
not
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
that
there
is
a
general
liberty
interest
in
dying.
but
we...
and
indeed
this
does
not...
this
isn't
an
acknowledgment
on
our
part
that
does
not
advance
our
conclusion
that
these
state
laws
are
constitutional.
but
we
felt
it
important
to
indicate
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
a
liberty
interest
that
is
sort
of
a...
deeply
a
part
of
the
antitotalitarian
principle,
the
state
may
not
compel
a
person
to
undergo
unwanted
medical
treatment,
recognized
very
substantially
in
history.
here
i
think
we're...
we
merely
look
at
cases
like
ingraham
against
wright
involving
corporal
punishment
or
the
prisoner
medical
cases
about
not
denying
prisoners
access
to
pain
relief
to
indicate
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest.
but
the
critical
part
here,
i
think,
is
that
here,
as
in
cruzan,
the
critical
issue
is
the
state's
overwhelming
interest.
states
have
long
had
laws
that
affirm
the
value
of
life
by
prohibiting
anyone
from
promoting
or
assisting
a
suicide
and
i
believe
that
no
one
disputes
the
constitutionality
of
those
laws
as
a
general
matter.
the
actual
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
constitution
compels
an
exception
to
those
laws
here.
in
our
view
it
does
not.
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--1790.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i'm
saying...
the
answer
is
not...
not
in
jest.
the
liberty
interest
that
we
suggest
unlike
the
generalized
liberty
interest
in
defining
the
time
and
manner
of
one's
death,
and...
and
we
would
have
made
our
oral
argument
easier
if
we
had
just
gone
along
with
the
states
on
this.
but...
but...
but,
in
fact,
we
believe
that,
that
if
one
alleges
the
kind
of
severe
pain
and
agony
that
is
being
suffered
here
and
that
the
state
is
the
cause
of
standing
between
you
and
the
only
method
of
relieving
that,
you
have
stated
a
constitutionally
cognizable
liberty
interest
to
which
a
merely
plausible
response
is
not
true.
if
the
state,
for
example,
justice
scalia,
barred
all
pain
medication
for
the
terminally
ill
on
a
theory
that
we
felt
was
merely
plausible,
we
think
that
you
would
need
something
more
substantial,
not
perhaps
a
compelling
governmental
interest
but...
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
i
think
our
difference
is
that...
is...
is...
is
perhaps
only
one
of
where
the
greater
analytical
clarity
comes
in.
we
put
this
on
the
side
of...
of
the
state's
compelling
interest,
because
here
i
think
what
is
critical
is
that,
if
this...
while
the
individual
stories
are
heartrending
and
make
the
case
for
an
exception
one
that
strikes
a
resonant
chord
for
many
people,
it's
important
for
this
court
to
recognize
that,
if
you
were
to
affirm
the
judgments
below,
lethal
medication
could
be
proposed
as
a
treatment,
not
just
to
those
in
severe
pain,
but
to
every
competent
terminally
ill
person
in
the
country.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
souter,
it
is
said
that
the
risks
that...
that
are
suggested
i
think
by
all
of
the
parties
are
best
weighed
by
you
with
the
understanding
that
no
american
jurisdiction
has
ever
recognized
physician-assisted
suicide
as
a
lawful
practice.
so
that
there's
no
experiential
basis
for
the
conclusion
that
there
could
be
adequate
safeguards
to
protect
those
who
are
suffering
from
depression
and
who
may
request
lethal
medication
because
of
untreated
depression
which
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
would
be--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
yes,
in
light
of
the
multiple
uncertainties
we
refer
to
in
our
brief,
it
would
be
i
think
a
grave
mistake
for
the
court
to
impose
on
50
states
such
a
marked
transformation
that
had
never
been
tried
by
even
a
single
state.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
that
the
states
have
interests
that
are
enduring
that
would
sustain
a
decision
by
the
state
simply
not
to
introduce
lethal
medication.
it
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
that
is...
that
is
correct.
and
i
would...
but
i
would...
i
would
refer
you...
i
know
one
seldom
reads
but
just
two
sentences
of
the
new
york
state
task
force
address
justice
souter's
question
on
life
and...
and,
well,
as
i
say
in
our
briefs
and
both
parties'
briefs
and
many
amicus
briefs.
but
after...
after
study
since
1982
they
said
that
for
purposes
of
public
debate--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--page
120,
justice
kennedy,
the
third
paragraph
below
the
middle
of
the
page.
they...
they
note
that
one
can
deposit
ideal
cases
in
which
all
recommended
safeguards
would
be
satisfied:
patients
would
be
screened
for
depression
and
offered
treatment,
effective
pain
medication
would
be
available,
and
all
patients
would
have
a
supportive,
committed
family
and
doctor.
yet
the
reality
of
existing
medical
practice
in
doctors'
offices
and
hospitals
cannot
generally
meet
these
expectations,
however
any
guidelines
or
safeguards
might
be
framed.
the
systemic
dangers
are
dramatic.
the
least
costly
treatment
for
any
illness
is
lethal
medication.
and
the
medical
profession
tells
you
in
briefs
from
the
a.m.a.,
the
national
hospice
organization,
the
american
geriatric
association,
the
nurses
association,
that
we
have
a
system
in
which
we
are
struggling
to
try
to
provide
proper
treatment
for
pain
and
for
depression.
someone
who
is
not
treated
for
pain
is
not
in
a
position
to
make
the
kind
of
decisions
they
need
to
be
forced
to
make
here.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
fact
that
25
percent
unnecessarily
die
in
pain
shows
the
task
awaiting
the
medical
profession,
but
it's
not
a
task
that
calls
for
the
cheap
and
easy
expedient
of
lethal
medication
rather
than
the
more
expensive
pain
palliative.
