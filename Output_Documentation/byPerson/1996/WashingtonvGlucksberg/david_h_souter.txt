mr.
williams,
taking
the
second
one
separately,
the
fear
of
abuse,
the
argument
runs
in
various
forms
that,
if
what
the...
what
the
two
courts
of
appeals
so
far
have
recognized
prevails,
the
risk
is
that,
in
fact,
the
practice
of
assistance,
so-called,
is
going
to
sort
of
gravitate
down
to
those
who
are
not
terminally
ill,
to
those,
in
fact,
who
have
not
made
a
truly
voluntary
or
knowing
choice.
and
ultimately
it's
going
to
gravitate
out
of
physician-assisted
suicide
into
euthanasia.
one
of
the
difficulties
that
i
have
with
this
case
and
with
the
one
that
follows
it
is
i'm
not
sure
how
i
should
weight
or
value
that
risk
or
those
risks.
what
the
argument
raises
is
plausible.
i
mean,
it's
easy
to
see.
but
i
don't
know
how
realistic
it
is.
and
i
don't
know
how
much
weight
to
put
on
it.
what
should
i
do,
where
should
i
look,
or
what
methodology
should
i
pursue
to
try
to
solve
my
difficulty?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
direct
you
into
a
narrower
channel.
i
understand
the,
let's
say,
the
problem
of
doctrinal
slippage
which
is
what
you're
talking
about
here.
but
there's
also
a,
just,
kind
of
an
empirical
component.
there's
is
a
prediction
about
what,
in
fact,
would
happen
even
if
the
doctrine
is
maintained
pure,
even
if
we
draw
a
line
and
that
line
is
never
going
to
be
crossed.
what
basis
do
i
have
for
evaluating
the
claim
that,
in
fact,
apart
from
doctrine,
this
slippage
is
going
to
occur
and
that,
in
effect,
the
innocent
are
going
to
die
as
a
result
of
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
variant...
i
think
that's
a
variant
of
the...
sort
of
the
problem
of
doctrinal
slippage.
this
is
step
one
and
they
have
step
two
or
three
or
whatever
in
mind.
my
question
is,
let's
assume
that
there
isn't
going
to
be
doctrinal
slippage,
let's
assume
that
we're
simply
evaluating
the
argument
that
if
you
recognize
what
is
being
requested
now,
in
fact,
what
will
happen
is
that
people
who
don't
consent,
who
are
not
terminally
ill,
who
do
not
even
self-administer,
are
going
to
end
up
dying
as
a
result
of
this.
what
empirical
basis
do
i
have
for
evaluating
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
anything
beyond
the
references
to
the
dutch
experience?
justice
david
h.
souter
general,
it
could.
the
problem
that
i'm
having
is
as
my
earlier
question
indicated
is
i...
i
don't
know
how
to
weight
this
probability
and
this
risk.
help
me
out
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
that...
that
might
be
a...
a
perfectly
legitimate
argument
for
saying
that,
on
the...
on
the
subject
of
recognizing
the...
the...
the...
the
ultimate
cognizability
of...
of
new
substantive
due
process
rights,
timing
is
a
legitimate
factor
in
what
the
court
does
and
maybe,
in
fact,
you
might
argue
the
court
should
wait
until
it
can
know
more--
justice
david
h.
souter
--before
it
passes
ultimate
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
still...
i...
i
confess
i
don't
understand
what
the
limit
is.
you,
for
example,
a
moment
ago
said
the...
the
person
with
a
longer
life
span
may
indeed
someday
rejoice
that...
that...
that
he
was
prevented
from
making
the
kind
of
decision
effectively
which
you
would
allow
here.
i
mean,
you
can
argue
that
of
the...
of
the
terminally
ill
patient.
i
mean,
we...
if
we
want
to
be
anecdotal,
we've
heard
anecdotes
about
those
who
suffer
and
at
the
moment
of
death
say
i
have
fought
the
good
fight.
i
mean,
you
can
make
exactly
the
same
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
in
each
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
your...
your
argument
basically
is
an
autonomy
argument,
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
the
reference
in
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
to
the
political
process
not
working.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
prior
cases
in
which
we
have
spoken
of
the
political
process
being
imperfect,
it
has
been
imperfect
for
exactly
the
reasons
suggested
by
her
question.
and
that
is,
there
were
certain
groups
who
simply
did
not
get
a
representative
fair
shake
for
whatever
reason.
that's
not
what
we've
got
here.
the
premise
of
her
question
i
thought
was,
in
any
case
i'll
make
it
the
premise
of
mine,
is
that
everybody
is
in
the
same
boat.
and,
if,
in
fact,
you
are
right
about
the
pervasiveness
of
the
denial
of
death,
that
denial
simply
reflects
the
way
we
are.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
perfectly
legitimate
reflection
when
it
finds
its
way
into
the
legislative
process.
is
there
a
flaw
in
that
reasoning?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
tucker,
may
i
challenge
your
premise.
your
premise
is
all
we
are
being
asked
to
do
is
to
recognize
the
vital
nature
of
the
liberty
interest.
but
the
issue
that
comes
before
us
in
a
substantive
due
process
case
like
this
is
an
issue
of
the
sort
that
has
described
in
the
question
compared
to
what.
and
it's
the...
compared
among
other
things,
the...
compared
to
what,
which
is
very,
very
difficult
for
us
to
assess.
and
it
may
be
impossible
for
a
court
to
assess
that
sensibly
for
a
long
time
until
there
is
more
experience
out
in
the
world
with
what
you
claim
ought
to
be
the
case
than
there
is
now.
why
isn't
that
a
reason
for
saying
we
are
not
in
a
position
either
to
weight
the
liberty
interest,
although
we
may
recognize
that
there
is
one,
or
to
weight
the
countervailing
claim
of
the
state.
and,
therefore,
for
substantive
due
process
purposes,
as
an
institution,
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
make
the
judgment
now
that
you
want
us
to
make.
it
would
just
be
guesswork.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
describes
something,
but
i
don't
understand
why
that
is
a
disposit...
i
don't
understand
what
that
justifies.
justice
david
h.
souter
by
why?
that's
what
you're
saying,
but
why?
