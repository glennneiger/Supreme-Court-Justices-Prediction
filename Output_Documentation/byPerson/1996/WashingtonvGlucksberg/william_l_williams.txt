mr.
william
l.
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
washington
to
defend
their
legislative
policy
judgment
to
prohibit
assisted
suicide.
the
constitutional
concept
of
ordered
liberty
requires
the
drawing
of
clear
lines
to
delineate
that
conduct
which
is
permissible
from
that
conduct
which
is
not.
the
washington
statute
prohibiting
assisted
suicide
was
forged
at
the
common
law,
tempered
by
centuries
of
legal
traditions
and
ratified
by
recent
legislative
action
and
by
a
direct
vote
of
the
people
of
washington.
the
same
prohibition
has
been
enacted
by
the
legislatures
of
virtually
every
state
and
the
line
that
it
draws
in
the
end-of-life
context
is
supported
by
the
organizations
of
the
health
care
professionals
who
care
for
the
sick
and
dying
on
a
daily
basis.
the
issue
here
today
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
the
social
policy
developed
by
washington
voters
must
be
supplanted
by
a
far
different
social
policy,
a
constitutionally
recognized
right
to
physician-assisted
suicide
that
is
contrary
to
our
traditions
and
overrides
the
important
state
interests
that
are
served
by
the
washington
statute.
in
contrast
to
the
clear
line
that
is
drawn
by
washington
law,
respondents
offer
a
line
that
is
unstable
and
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty.
it
is
inconsistent
with
liberty
in
three
respects.
first,
it
is
limited
to
a
very
few
of
our
citizens.
secondly,
those
few
must
justify
their
exercise
of
this
so-called
constitutional
right.
thirdly,
if...
even
the
respondents
and
their
amici
agree
that
this
right,
if
it
is
to
be
exercised
at
all,
if
it
is
to
be
recognized
at
all,
must
be
closely
regulated.
and
their
equal
protection
argument
demonstrates
just
how
unstable
the
line
is,
because
they
suggest
that
flowing
from
this
court's
assumed
recognition
of
a
right
to
refuse
treatment
in
the
cruzan
case,
there
is
a
seamless
web
of
constitutional...
excuse
me,
a
seamless...
stream
of
constitutional
rights
that
flows
from
that
decision.
mr.
william
l.
williams
yes,
ma'am,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
william
l.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
one
could
take
that
approach.
the
problem
that
that
would
create
by
recognizing
a
liberty
interest
is
that
many
states
are
considering
whether
to
move
the
line
by
legislation...
in
fact,
our
sister
state
of
oregon
has
done
just
that...
in
the
beginning
of
a
recognition
of
a
liberty
interest
may
limit
their
flexibility
to
deal
with
this
complicated
area.
we
agree
that,
even
if
you
find
the
existence
of
a
liberty
interest,
that
the
same
important
state
interests
that
were
present
in
cruzan
are
present
in
this
case
and
would
justify
the
statute
nonetheless.
mr.
william
l.
williams
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
williams
your
honor,
there
are
three
important
state
interests
that
are
involved.
the
first
one
is
life,
which
includes
the
state's
interest
in
prevent...
is
a
subset
the
interest
of
preventing
suicide.
and,
in
the
hierarchy
of
constitutional
value,
certainly
the
protection
of
life
is
the
highest.
in
fact,
one
could
argue
that
that's
why
people
organize
into
communities,
into
civilized
societies,
is
to
protect
life.
the
second
one
is
to
prevent
abuse
and
undue
influence,
and
certainly
the
risk
is
higher
in
the
physician-assisted
suicide
context
than
it
is
in
the
refusal
of
treatment
context.
and
thirdly,
there
is
a
strong
interest
in
regulating
the
medical
profession.
precisely
because
physicians
have
the
capacity
to
injure
or
perhaps
cause
the
death
of
their
patients,
the
state
has
an
important
interest
in
maintaining
a
clear
line
between
physicians
as
healers
and
curers
and
physicians
as
instruments
of
death
of
their
patients.
and
we
believe
all
three
of
those
interests
together
or
frankly
any
one
of
them
separately
would
support
the
state
legislation
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
williams
i
would
make
at
least
two
suggestions,
justice
souter.
first,
look
at
the
respondents'
equal
protection
argument
and
contrast
that
with
the
doctrinal
support
that
they
offer
for
a
liberty
interest
in
this
case.
the
doctrinal
support
that
they
offer
does
not
provide
the
limitations
that
they
suggest
should
be
in
play
with
respect
to
this
liberty
interest.
yet
their
equal
protection
argument
that
equates
the
withdrawal
of
medical
treatment,
in
effect,
which
is
a
time-honored
right
under
our
common-law,
with
the
physician-assisted
suicide,
when
assisted
suicide
itself
was
contrary
to
the
common
law,
it
was
a
common-law
crime,
and
yet
they
equate
those
two,
while
these
respondents
may
say
that
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
limit
this
to
a
narrow
class,
the
next
case
will
argue
much
the
same
as
they
have,
that
it
should
be
extended
perhaps
to
the
chronically
ill,
perhaps
to
those
who...
to
euthanasia
for
those
who
can't
administer
that.
and
in
fact,
some
of
their
amici
have
acknowledged
that.
mr.
william
l.
williams
again,
the
second
suggestion
i
was
going
to
make
would
be
to
look
at
the
district
court
decision
in
the
case
involving
the
oregon
statute,
where
the
district
court
noted
that
the
proponents
of
the
oregon
law
which
is
limited
in
the
same
way
that
these
respondents
suggest
it
should
be,
to
the
terminally
ill.
but
the
proponents
of
that
law
acknowledged
in
that
district
court
proceeding
that
they
intend...
that
this
was
a
first
step
and
it
would
be
extended
by
statute.
mr.
william
l.
williams
well,
there's
no
empirical
basis
in
our
country,
of
course,
because
we
do
not
have
a
history
of
recognizing
that.
mr.
william
l.
williams
well,
there's
the
references
to
the
dutch
experience
which
are
i
think
important
and
telling
in
terms
of
modern
history.
and,
of
course,
there
is
the
german
experience
in
the
early
1930s.
mr.
william
l.
williams
the
northern
territory
of
australia,
justice
ginsburg,
has
authorized
by
statutory
action
a
form
of
physician-assisted
suicide.
and
i
think
a
state
may
legitimately
create
an
exception
to
its
homicide
laws
for
physician-assisted
suicide.
and
if
it
is
subject
only
to
rational
basis
rule...
review,
then
i
think
that
the
line
could
be
maintained
at
the
terminally
ill.
mr.
william
l.
williams
that's
my
understanding,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
l.
williams
i
believe
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
william
l.
williams
i
think
that
legislation
is
so
new,
my
understanding
it
just
became
effective
in
this
past
year
in
1996,
that
we
don't...
i'm
not
aware
of
any--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--yes,
justice
stevens,
it
is.
legislature
under
its
police
powers
can
define
the
crime
of
homicide,
and
a
subcomponent
of
that
is
the
current
physician...
excuse
me,
the
current
assisted
suicide
statute.
mr.
william
l.
williams
my...
your
honor,
the
district
court
said
that
the
statute
that
they
adopted
did
not
have
adequate
safeguards
and,
therefore,
did
not
qual...
did
not
meet
rational
basis
review
for
equal
protection
purposes.
it
did
not
say
that,
as
a
constitutional
concept,
they
couldn't
strengthen
those.
mr.
william
l.
williams
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
judge
rhinehart.
mr.
william
l.
williams
let
me
be
perfectly
clear
on
that.
[laughter]
mr.
william
l.
williams
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest,
that...
maybe
if
i
could
explain
it
differently.
if
you
accept
our
position,
which
is
rational
basis
review
would
be
the
appropriate
level
of
review,
then
states
would
have
the
maximum
flexibility
to
look
at
this
complicated
and
complex
issue
and
decide
on
a
state-by-state
basis.
i
don't
know
for
certain
that
assuming
a
liberty
interest
in
sustaining
the
statute
would
complicate
it.
i
am
concerned,
depending
on
how
that's
expressed,
that
it
may
complicate
it,
that's
all
i
was
trying
to
say.
mr.
william
l.
williams
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
disagree
to
this
extent:
i
believe
the
state...
the
same
important
state
interests
that
were
implicated
in
the
cruzan
case
are
implicated
here
but
more
strongly,
because
in
the
context
of
withdrawing
life
support
and
in
the
physician
assisted
suicide
there
are
some
different
factual--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
l.
williams
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
we...
the
other
point
i
was
going
to
make
to
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
your
question,
there
is
the
oregon
employment
security
division
versus
smith
case,
the
peyote
case,
where
the
court
there,
involving
a
much
stronger
interest,
the
first
amendment
free
exercise
of
religion,
nonetheless
upheld
an
absolute
ban
on
the
use
of
drugs
because
of
the
state's
important
interest
in
its
drug
enforcement
policies.
mr.
william
l.
williams
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
l.
williams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
no
question
that
death
and
dying
are
difficult
issues
around
which
to
formulate
public
policy.
and
there's
also
no
question
that
the
line
that
currently
exists,
although
bright
and
understandable
by
all,
may
be
exceedingly
fine
in
its
application.
mr.
william
l.
williams
your
honor,
we
have
to
go
only
by
the
data
that
we
have.
and
there
is
only
one
study
in
washington
state,
and
for
that
matter
it's
the
only
study
i
know
of
nationally,
in
which
doctors
were
asked
whether
they
had
been
requested
to
provide
assistance
in
suicide
to
terminally
ill
patients
and,
if
so,
to
what
extent
they
had
complied
with
those
requests
and
whether
they
had
then
been
carried
out.
and
in
that
study
there
were
about
200
requests,
30--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
either.
mr.
william
l.
williams
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
but
i
would
remind
the
court
that
there
are
other
regulations
as
well,
the
licensing
regulations,
the
heavy
regulation
of
these
very
dangerous
drugs,
the
regulation
of
the
health
care
facilities,
there
are
other
constraints.
and
i
guess
the
other
thing
i
would
observe--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--most
of
the...
i
believe
all
of
the
statutes
making
that
a
crime
have
been
repealed
because
of
the
recognition
or
the
heavy
influence
that
mental
disease,
most
likely
depression,
plays
in
the
request
for
suicide.
and
that...
by
the
way,
there
are
studies
showing
that
that's
true
with
respect
to
people
suffering
a
serious
illness
as
well.
so
it's
the...
the
suggestion
that
somehow
the
terminally
ill
and
dying
are
different
in
that
regard
is
again
not
substantiated
by
the
studies.
but
the
other
observation
i
was
going
to
make
is
that
if
one
assumes
that
there
is
some
covert
practice
in
the
current
law
with
the
line
as
clear
as
it
is,
if
the
line
becomes
unstable
or
gets
muddied
and
the
very
private
nature
of
the
physician-assisted
suicide
transaction,
if
you
will,
between
the
physical
and
the
patient,
one
must
conclude
that
the
abuses,
if
they
exist
at
all,
will
be
much
worse.
at
least
the
potential
for
abuse
will
be
much
worse
in
that
setting
as
well.
mr.
william
l.
williams
absolutely,
justice
kennedy.
if
you
read
the
brief
of
the
american
medical
association
and
the
american
nurses
association
and
the
other
health
care
groups
who
filed
a
consolidated
brief,
that
that
information
is
in
there,
as
well
as
the
american
geriatric
society
brief.
and
one
of
policy
arguments
against
allowing
physician-assisted
suicide
is
that
it
might
be...
become
the
alternative
to
improvements
in
palliative
care.
whether
that's
not...
known
or
not,
who
knows,
but
that's
one
of
considerations
that
anyone
making
this
policy
decision
should
take
into
account.
justice
souter,
i
have
had
an
opportunity
to
think
a
little
bit
more
about
your
question
about
what...
experience.
and
i
would
point
out
that,
in
the
netherlands,
one
of
the
problems
is
that,
because
it's
now
permitted,
it's
become
institutionalized.
and
there
is...
although
there
is
some
disagreement
about
how
the
data
is
interpreted,
that
it
appears
to
be
pretty
clear
that
a
significant
number
of
the
deaths
occur
involuntarily
without
any
consultation
with
the
patient.
the
physicians
over
time
believe
they
know
what
the
patients
will
want
and
go
ahead
at
what
they
think
is
the
appropriate
time
and
administer
that.
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
supreme
court
of
canada
has
rejected
the
notion
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
under
their
article
of
freedoms,
which
is
very
similar
to
our
due
process
clause.
and
that
the
british
government,
with
the
assistance
of
the
british
medical
society,
considered
this,
they
rejected
the
notion
on
policy
grounds.
and
of
course,
the
new
york
state
task
force,
which
is
the
most
comprehensive
report
on
this
subject.
so
while
we
can't
foretell
the
future
for
sure,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
a
legislature
should
take
into
account
and
we're
asking
the
court
to
give
the
legislature
that
opportunity.
mr.
william
l.
williams
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
know
of
any
such
thing,
but
i
don't
want
to
represent
that
i
have
a
comprehensive
knowledge
on
that.
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
in
the
withdrawal
and
refusal
of
treatment,
the
advocates
for
the
handicapped
would
suggest
that
that's
become
institutionalized,
and
that...
there
was
an
article
in
the
post
on
sunday
suggesting
that
handicapped
persons
who
are
admitted
to
hospitals
are
routinely...
not
routinely,
but
upon
occasion
at
least,
sort
of
coerced--
