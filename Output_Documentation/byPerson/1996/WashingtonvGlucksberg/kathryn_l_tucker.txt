ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
dying
citizens
in
full
possession
of
their
mental
faculties
at
the
threshold
of
death
due
to
terminal
illness
have
the
liberty
to
choose
to
cross
that
threshold
in
a
humane
and
dignified
manner.
does
our
constitution
endow
government
with
the
power
to
intrude
into--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
why
we
are
focused
on
that
is
because
these
dying
patients
want
a
peaceful
death,
they
want
a
humane
death
and
they
want
a
dignified
death.
and,
in
order
to
access
that
kind
of
death
they
need
the
assistance
of
their
physician.
the
physician
is
the
gatekeeper
for
the
medications
that
can
bring
that
peaceful
end
to
the
suffering
that
for
these
patients
is
intolerable.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
your
honor--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--justice
scalia,
we
do
draw
the
line
at
a
patient
who
is
confronting
death.
that
individual
has
a
very
different
choice
than
the
one
you
posit.
this
individual
does
not
have
a
choice
between
living
and
dying.
this
dying
patient
whose
dying
process
has
begun
and
is
underway,
this
individual
has
only
the
choice
of
how
to
die.
will
that
death
be
brutal,
will
that
death
be
peaceful.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
well,
i
think
not,
justice
scalia,
because
the
patient
who
is
facing
this
question
of
how
to
die...
this
is
the
final
decision
for
this
individual.
this
is
a
patient
who
physicians
do
not
have
the
difficulty
that
the
state
would
suggest
in
determining
that,
in
fact,
the
dying
process
really
is
imminent
at
this
point.
now,
keep
in
mind
in
the
record
in
this
case
it
was
never
disputed
that
these
patients
who
came
forward
to
bring
this
case
were,
in
fact,
quite
close
to
death
and
then
subsequently
all
did
die.
there's
no
dispute
in
the
record
about
that.
the
physicians
each
testified
in
both
of
these
cases
that
it
is
their
regular
medical
practice
to
make
that
diagnosis
and
of
course--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
that
class
of
persons
in
reality
would
exist.
we
believe
that
any
patient
who
could
fully
express
their
wishes
with
regard
to
this
end
of
life
choice--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
see
your
point.
i
think
you
are
describing
someone
who
just
can't
bring
themself
to
do
it,
as
opposed
to
having
the--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--your
honor,
we
would
posit
that
that
is
not
permissible,
that
self-administration
does
address
an
important
state
concern
here,
and
that's
the
concern
of
voluntariness.
we
agree
that
this
decision
should
always
rest
with
the
individual
and
that
it
should
be
authentic
and
voluntary.
and
to
require
the
individual
to
not
only
make
this
choice
but
then
to
take
the
final
act,
we
believe
assures
voluntariness
in
an
important
way.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
well--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
think
again
in
the
constitutional
analysis,
your
honor,
we
are
considering
the
state
interests
as
balanced
against
the
patient's
interests.
and
because
voluntariness
is
so
essential
here,
an
additional
guarantee
of
voluntariness
tips
that
balance
differently.
and
i
would
posit
that,
when
the
patient
is
fully
mentally
competent,
is
making
a
reasoned
and
deliberative
decision
and
is
able
then
to
take
final
action
on
that
decision,
that
the
balance
clearly
tips
in
favor
of
individual
having
the
right
to
exercise
this
choice.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
that--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
your
honor,
mental
competency
and
freedom
from
a
mental
disability
or
instability
including
such
as
a
condition--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--like
depression.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
i
think
that
mental
competency
here
is
a
bright
line
and
that
the...
that
decision
as
to
whether
the
patient
is
mentally
competent,
of
course,
is
a
clinician's
judgment.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
well,
and
again
that
patient
is
not
confronted
with
the
choice
that
we
address
in
this
lawsuit.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
that
individual,
if
intervention
occurs
and
is
not
allowed
to
make
this
choice,
may
one
day
rejoice
in
that.
it
is
an
individual
who
has
an
expectation
of
life
that
could
then
be
a
fruitful
and
fulfilling
life
which
is
not
the
case
with
a
patient
whose
life
is
ending
due
to
the
progress
of
terminal
illness.
that
patient
has
an
entirely
different
character
of
interest.
and
i
do
want
to
address--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
believe
that
the
constitutional--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
believe
that's
an
entirely
different
case,
your
honor.
and
i
did
want
to
respond
to
what
the
solicitor
general
is
suggesting--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
well,
the...
the
terminally
ill
patient
does
not
have
the
expectation
of
a
continued
life
beyond
this
very
short
interim
before
death.
certainly
the
patient
that
you
described
that
would
choose
to
endure
that
period
of
suffering
before
death
and
find
it
ennobling
and
find
it
fulfilling
should
be
permitted
to
make
that
choice,
and
many
will
make
that
choice,
justice
souter.
but
for
some
patients,
based
on
their
values
and
beliefs
formed
over
a
lifetime,
that
additional
quantum
of
suffering
is
intolerable
to
their
personhood.
the
notion--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--well,
this...
this
i
think
will
enable
me
to
respond
to
the
solicitor
general's
comment
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
simply
a
liberty
interest
in
avoiding
pain
and
suffering.
that
absolutely
trivializes
the
claim.
we
have
a
constellation
of
interest,
each
of
great
constitutional
dimension.
yes,
there
is
the
interest
in
avoiding
pain
and
suffering.
and
that,
of
course,
was
recognized
as
recently
as
in
casey
as
being
an
important
feature.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
it
is--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--the...
the
second
in
the
constellation
of
interest
is
decisional
autonomy,
and
the
third
in
the
constellation
that
has
bearing
here
is
the
interest
in
bodily
integrity.
each
of
those
separate
interests
is
of
constitutional
dimension
and
each
has
bearing
here.
going--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
think
that's
possible,
justice
ginsburg.
i
do
think
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
state
in
an
abundance
of
concern
in
that
regard
to
impose
a
waiting
period.
it
would
be
appropriate
to
ensure
that
this
decision
is
reflective
and
that
it
is
enduring.
and
that
is
a
kind
of
regulation
that
certainly--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--justice
ginsburg,
we
are
asking
simply
that
this
court
recognize
the
vital
liberty
interest
at
stake
and
that
it
is
a
protected
choice
but
not
asking
this
court
to
engage
in
legislation,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
promulgate
a
code
for
regulation
of
the
practice.
we
do
think
it
should
be
left
to
the
states.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
i
think
not,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
for
this
reason,
we
do
think
it's
appropriate
for
that
experimentation
to
occur
in
the
states.
there
is
substantial
consensus
as
to
what
form
of
regulation
would
be
appropriate.
and
what
i
can
direct
you
to
in
that
regard
is
the
amicus
briefing
by
the
state
legislators--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--well,
i
think
that
what
we
see
when
we
look
at
the
quite
extensive
proposed
models
that
are
both
in
the
medical
and
legal
literature
and
have
been
presented
to
the
court
and
discussed
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
is
that
there
is
substantial
agreement
from
all
factions
that
have
joined--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
take
your
point,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
do
think
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
issue,
the
literature
is
extensive
on
this,
that
ours
is
a
culture
of
denial
of
death.
and
that
people
in
our
society
do
not
deal
with
their
own
mortality
until
confronted
with
their
death
and
because
of
that
i
think
we
do
have
some
concerns
that
the
political
process
would
not
be
expected
to
work
in
a
usual
fashion.
we
also
have
the
reality.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
we
also
have
the
problem,
your
honor,
of
the
quite
well-established
and
understood
underground
practice
of
physician
aid
in
dying
and
that
that
is
available
primarily
to
the
educated
and
the
affluent
who
can
access
a
physician
to
provide
in
that
assistance.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
well,
i
think
what
i
was
getting
at,
justice
souter,
is
that
because
there's
the
denial
and
people
do
not
confront
mortality
until
faced
up
against
it,
you
do
not
have
an
activist
component
that
is
able
to
address
that
in
the
legislative
process.
when
a
patient
is
on
their
death
bed,
they
don't
have
the
ability
to
become
politically
active.
and
that
is
part
of
the
problem--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
think
the
final
point
that
i
will
address
to
the
court
on
why
we
should
not
simply
leave
this
to
the
legislative
process
is
perhaps
the
most
important
point,
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
never
left
to
the
legislative
process
the
protection
of
vital
liberties,
and
the
liberty
at
issue
in
this
case
is
certainly
of
a
vital
and
substantial
nature.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
we're
asking
this
court
to
simply
recognize
the
vital
nature
of
this
liberty
and
to
leave
to
state
experimentation
the
regulatory
process
and
the
state--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
think,
justice
souter,
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
guidance
on
how
to
weight
this
liberty
interest
in
this
court's
precedence.
i
think,
if
one
looks
to
the
cruzan
case,
where
the
patient
there
had
lost
permanently
all
cognition
and
the
question
was
whether
her
feeding
tube
could
be
withdrawn
so
that
she
might
die
as
a
result,
the
court
there
found
that
to
be
a
very
significant
liberty
interest,
because
the
idea.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
yes.
thank
you,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
yes,
it
is
correct.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
i
went
straight
to
cruzan
because
it's
most
factually
similar
and
i
appreciate
the
correction
that,
of
course,
it
was
just
an
assumption
by
the
court.
and
that
assumption
was
that
that
individual
had
a
liberty
interest
in
being--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--yes.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
in
cruzan
that
is
correct,
absolutely,
your
honor,
however,
the
focus
was
very
much
on
preserving
to
the
individual
the
choice.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
the
point
that...
of
cruzan
that
i
wish
to
suggest
has
important
bearing
here
is
the
point
that
in
reviewing
the
state
legislation
that
did
impose
that
very
high
evidentiary
standard,
the
point
was
that
that
was
permissible
to
do
so
because
it
did
then
safeguard
the
personal
element
of
the
individual's
choice
that--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--it
also,
your
honor,
was
based
on
broader
concepts
than
just
being
free
of
unwanted
bodily
invasion.
it
includes
within
it
the
ability
to
make
decisions,
and
the
right
decisions.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
i
understand
the
cruzan
assumption
of
a
liberty
interest
to
be
something
in
addition
to
a
recognition
that
the
common
law
had
protected
against
bodily
invasion.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
correct.
and
i
think
that
moving
into
this
subject
of
withdrawal
of
treatment
and
what
bearing
it
has
here,
i'd
like
to
direct
some
comments
there.
in
washington
an
individual
can
direct
the
withdrawal
of
treatment
and
have
the
medical
assistance
in
doing
so.
and
washington's
legislature
has
described
that
as
a
fundamental
right
and
to
protect
the
dignity
and
autonomy
of
the
patient.
and
here,
where
a
patient
does
not
happen
to
be
on
a
removable
form
of
life
support
but
has,
of
course,
had
extensive
medical
treatment,
that
has
very
much
changed
their
way
of
dying.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
because
i
think,
your
honor,
that
this
decision
is
so
profoundly
personal,
so
intimate
to
the
individual,
so
much
based
on
their
own
values
and
beliefs
and
perhaps
religious
beliefs
included
among
those
that
the
for
the
state
to--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--this,
however,
your
honor,
has
to
do
with
one's
own
body,
one's
own
medical
care,
and
suffering
in
the
face
of
death.
and
that
brings
it
within...
if
any
decision
falls
within
the
private
realm
of
decision-making,
which
this
court
has
indicated
the
government
may
not
enter,
it
would
be
this
decision.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
that
this
is
a
liberty,
your
honor,
that
involves
bodily
integrity,
decisional
autonomy,
and
the
right
to
be
free
of
unwanted
pain
and
suffering,
and
that
that
constellation
of
interests
gives
rise
to
a
vital
liberty,
at
least
of
the
level
of
cruzan.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
yes.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
yes,
your
honor,
and
again
that
gets
back
to
the
fact
that
these
individuals
that
are
in
the
process
of
dying
are
confronted
only
with
the
choice
of
how
to
die,
they
are
not
confronted
with
the
choice
of
should
i
live
or
should
i
die.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
it
is
as
if,
your
honor,
the
right
that
we
claim
here
only
ripens
or
matures
when
that
patient
is
at
that
stage.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
i
don't
think
that
the
interest
is
as
weighty
at
that
point,
i
think
that
the
state's
interests
are
greater
perhaps
at
a
prior
point
where
that
individual
may
go
on
to
lead
a
fulfilling
life
and
contribute
to
society.
this
is
not
the
case
for
someone
who
is
right
about
to
die.
and
i
would
also
like
to
say
that
the
state
of
washington
has
recognized
that
the
state's
interest
should
ordinarily
give
way
when
a
patient
is
in
that
phase,
because
the
state
does
permit
the
individual
to
make
the
choice
to
direct
the
withdrawal
of
treatment
and
thereby
bring
about
death
as
a
result.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
no.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
actually,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
state
of
washington,
both
by
statute
and
by
case
law,
the
right
to
direct
the
withdrawal
of
treatment
is
specifically
limited
to
two
situations.
and
that
is
terminal
illness
or
permanent
unconsciousness.
and
so
we
have
the
statutory
and
judicial--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
think
that
on
those
kinds
of
situations
you
may
implicate
different
rights
to
refuse
the
treatment,
first
amendment
rights
perhaps.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
i
don't
think
so
much
that
you
are
compelled
to
pursue
medical
treatment.
but
i
think
that
if
you
are--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
was
pointing
out
that
in
the
state
of
washington
the
right
to
direct
the
withdrawal
of
treatment
is
limited,
tightly,
to
those
who
are
terminally
ill.
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
yes.
the
withdrawal
of
life-sustaining
treatment
is
limited
to
terminally
ill
patients
and
those
that
are
permanently
unconscious.
and
because
the
state
has
recognized--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--well,
we
do
that
in
the
state
of
washington,
as
many
states
do,
through
the
advanced
directive,
so
that...
this
is
the
law
that
i'm
referring
to
is
that
advanced
directive
law.
but
for
patients
who
are
competent,
presently
competent,
it
is
limited
to
patients
who
are
terminally
ill.
and
it's
the
state's
recognition
that
when
the--
ms.
kathryn
l.
tucker
--i
think
in
that
context,
your
honor,
the
doctrine
of
informed
consent
would
arise
and
the
question
could
the...
would
the
patient
consent
to
the
treatment.
and
if
the
patient
refused
to
consent,
i
do
think
it's
possible
that
if
that
patient
was
appearing
to
refuse
for
suicidal
reasons,
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
intervene
in
what
would
seem
to
be
a
suicidal
act.
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest,
is
that
it's
not
a
completely
unlimited
and
unfettered
right
to
reject
treatment.
a
patient
who
has
a
temporary
condition
that
can
be
resolved
through
a
short
period
of
life-sustaining
treatment
and
then
go
on
to
a
healthy
life
is
not
a
patient
in
the
state
of
washington.

i
don't
think
that
it
becomes
less
intensely
personal,
but
i
do
think,
as
i
have
indicated
in
earlier
responses,
that
it's
a
different
choice
for
that
patient.
it
is
the
choice
of
how
to
die
when
confronted
by
death
that
distinguishes
it
and
does,
in
fact,
place
it
in
a
separate
category.
