so...
so
what...
what
should
i
make
i
thought
in
these
very
helpful
briefs
and
there
were
so
many
helpful
briefs,

statistics,
and

that
worried
me
the
most
that
says
that
only
between
1
percent
or
2
percent
of
possibly
all
people
need
die
in
pain.
but
25
percent
or
more
do
die
in
pain.
and
i
suppose
that
the
first
fact
isn't
of
much
help
to
the
people
in
the
second
category.
i'd
like
to
get
a...
i'd
like
to
get
a
reaction
from
you.
