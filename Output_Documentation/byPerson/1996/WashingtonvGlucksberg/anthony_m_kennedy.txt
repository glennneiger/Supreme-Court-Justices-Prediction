you
indicated
in
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg
that,
if
we
assumed
a
liberty
interest
but
nevertheless
found
that
the
very
substantial
arguments
you
have
made
outweighed
it,
so
that
the
washington
laws
would
remain
in
effect,
that
this
would
somehow
be
confining
to
legislators
and
regulators?
i
wasn't
quite
sure
that
i
followed
that.
i
understand
the
doctrinal
significance
of
this
suggestion
that
was
made.
i
wasn't
sure
of
its
practical
implications
that
so
concerned
you.
would
you
expand
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
analysis
usually
is
to
ask
and
to
determine
whether
there's
a
liberty
interest
at
the
outset
rather
than
say
that
your...
that
that
inquiry
is
going
to
be
affected
by
the
standard
of
review
that
you
use.
you
don't
say,
oh,
well,
i'll
find
liberty
interest
because
it's
going
to
be
a
rational
basis
and
everything
is
going
to
come
out
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
page?
what
page
are
you
reading
from.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
is...
it
is
different.
but
it
means
that
there
is
a
limit
to
this
autonomy
that
you
are
supposing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
are
saying
that
the
state
can
tell
individuals
that
they
may
not
take
their
own
life.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
is...
it
is
not
only
important,
but
it's
essential--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
your...
to
your
definition
of
the
liberty
interest.
and
we
don't
understand
how
that
squares,
a,
with
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
ruled
in
your
favor
and,
b,
with
this
definition
of
autonomy
which
you
are
asserting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
a
matter
of
defining
the
liberty.
and
this
is
a
question
of
ethics
and
of
morals
and
of
allocation
of
resources
and
of
our
commitment
to
treat
the
elderly
and
the
infirm.
and
surely
legislators
have
much
more
flexibility
and
a
much
greater
capacity
to
absorb
those
kind
of
arguments
and
make
those
decisions
than
we
do.
you're
asking
us
in
effect
to
declare
unconstitutional
the
law
of
fifty
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
disagree
with
that
characterization.
i
think
the
court
was
very,
very
careful
to
assume
a
liberty
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
rather
critical
point,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
talking
about
all
of
these
precedents,
so
this
first
precedent
you
site
cruzan
and
that
was
just
an
assumption
contrary
to
your
description?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
what
is
the
law
in
the
state
of
washington?
i
have
a
toothache,
i
have
to
go
get
it
fixed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
telling
us
what
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington
is.
and
i
thought
you
told
justice
ginsburg
and
us
that
in
washington
there
is
no
right
to
refuse
medical
treatment
except
under
some
very
narrow
conditions.
this
may
be
true
with
comatose
people
or
people
in
temporary
shock.
but
i
assume
that
justice
ginsburg
meant...
and
we're
interested
here,
our
whole
discussion...
is
about
those
who
are
competent
and
have
a
voluntary
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
literature
tell
us
that
there
have
been
significant
advances
in
palliative
care
to
reduce
pain
for
the
terminally
ill
over
the
last
five
years,
or
the
last
ten
years?
