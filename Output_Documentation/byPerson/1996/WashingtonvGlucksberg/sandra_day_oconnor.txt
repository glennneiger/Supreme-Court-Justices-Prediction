what
are
the
state
interests
you
would
argue
support
the
law
here
in
the
event
that
a
liberty
interest
is
recognized?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
dellinger,
these
last
questions,
of
course,
really
should
be
addressed
by
you
because
it's
your
brief
that
takes
the
position
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest,
but
nonetheless,
the
law
should
be
upheld.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
does
it
differ
from
the
liberty
interest
recognized
or
assumed,
let's
say,
by
the
plurality
in
cruzan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
would
result
if
we
upheld
your
position,
it
would
result
in
a
flow
of
cases
through
the
court
system
for
heaven
knows
how
long.
i
wanted
to
ask
you
whether
it
should
enter
the
balance
of
state
interests
versus
the
interests
of
the
patient
here,
that
this
is
an
issue
that
every
one
of
us
faces,
young
or
old,
male
or
female,
whatever
it
might
be.
and
all
of
us
who
are
citizens
and
authorized
to
vote
can
certainly
participate
through
that
process
in
the
development
of
state
laws
in
this
area.
does
that
cause
the
balance
in
any
way
to
shift
do
you
think?
we
are
not
dealing
perhaps
with
an
unrepresented
group,
a
group
of
children
or
a
group
of
women
who
have
no
other
means
to
protect
themselves,
some
specific
confined
group.
this
is
something
that
affects
all
of
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
you
would
have
a
pretty
good
case
if
you
had
some
kind
of
kidney
disease
and
said,
i'm
not
going
to
take
dialysis:
or
somebody
offers
surgery
to
remedy
something
that's
going
to
be
a
serious
life
threatening
problem
and
you
say,
thanks
but
no
thanks.
now
somebody
has
that
treatment
forced
on
them,
maybe
they
ought
to
bring
a
case.
