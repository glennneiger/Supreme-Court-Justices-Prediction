we'll

argument
now
in
no.
96-110,
washington
versus
harold
glucksberg.
mr.
williams--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
australian
proposal
was
not
as
the
result
of
a
judicial
decision
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
kind
of
express
its
disapproval
of
the
district
court
ruling
in
oregon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
assume
a
liberty
interest
and
rule
in
your
favor
in
this
case,
would
it
not?
because
if
we
assume
a
liberty
interest
but
nonetheless
say
that,
even
assuming
a
liberty
interest,
a
state
can
prohibit
it
entirely,
that
would
be
rather
a
conundrum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
cruzan
what
we
were
dealing
with
was
a
state
rule
that
said
you
had
to
prove
a
certain
thing
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
here
we're
not
dealing
with
any
sort
of
an
evidentiary
rule,
we're
dealing
with
an
outright
prohibition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
williams.
general
dellinger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
what
precisely
is
the
liberty
interest
that
you
urge
us
to
recognize?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
wasn't
the
basis
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
decided
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
dellinger.
ms.
tucker,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say...
you
say
they
have
the...
have
the
liberty
to
choose.
but
no...
as
i
understand
it
there
is
not
an
issue
here.
any
patients
choosing
to
die
or
to
commit
suicide,
it's
that
they
want
assistance
from
a
physician
to
do
it,
that's
what
we're
arguing
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
asking
that
now.
but
surely
that's
what
the
next
couple
of
generations
are
going
to
have
to
deal
with,
what
regulations
are
permissible
and
whatnot
if
we
uphold
your
position
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
going
to
find
the
same
thing
i
suspect
that
perhaps
has
happened
with
the
abortion
cases,
there
are
people
who
are
just
totally
opposed
and
people
who
are
totally
in
favor
of
them.
so
you're
going
to
have
those
factions
fighting
it
out
in
every
session
of
the
legislature,
how
far
can
we
go
in
regulating
this.
and
that
will
be
a
constitutional
decision
in
every
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
cruzan
was
primarily
about
choice
in
the
sense
you're...
it
was...
the
liberty
interest
it
recognized
was
the
right
to
be
refused
medical
treatment,
which
was
based
on
the
common-law
idea
that...
imposition
of
a
medical
treatment
was
a
battery
of
common
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
now
drawing
language...
i
don't
think
there
was
language
like
that
in
the
cruzan
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
remark
just
now,
that
was
not
a
quotation
from
anything
in
cruzan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
someone
who
is
permanently...
aren't
you
talking
about
substituted
judgment?
someone
who
is
permanently
unconscious
obviously
cannot
direct
the
withdrawal
of
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
consider
that
a
question,
if
you
wish,
and
answer.
[laughter]
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
tucker.
mr.
williams,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
williams,
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
opinion
which
i
have
to
announce
is
washington
against
glucksberg,
no.
96-110,
and
this
case
too
deals
with
physician-assisted
suicide.
in
washington
state,
it
is
a
crime
to
knowingly
cause
or
aid
another
person
to
commit
suicide.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
this
prohibition
on
assisted
suicide
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
respondents
are
doctors
who
claim
that
competent,
terminally
ill
adults
have
a
constitutional
right
to
physician-assisted
suicide.
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
relying
primarily
on
our
decision
in
cruzan
and
planned
parenthood
versus
casey
agreed.
that
court
held
that
the
liberty
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
includes
the
right
to
choose
the
time
and
manner
of
one’s
death
and
that
the
washington
statute
was
therefore
unconstitutional.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
in
our
opinion,
we
review,
at
length,
our
nation’s
history,
traditions,
and
practice
relating
to
suicide
and
assisting
suicide.
washington’s
assisted
suicide
ban
is
no
innovation.
quite
the
contrary,
for
centuries,
our
anglo-american
legal
tradition
has
punished
or
otherwise
disapproved
the
both
suicide
and
assisting
suicide.
it
is
true
that
attitudes
towards
suicide
itself
have
changed
over
the
years,
but
it
is
still
regarded
as
a
grave
public
wrong.
today,
because
of
advances
in
medicine
and
technology,
americans
are
increasingly
likely
to
die
in
institutions.
this
fact
has
focused
public
attention
on
the
question
of
how
to
protect
people’s
dignity
and
independence
at
the
end
of
life.
as
a
result,
many
states
now
permit
living
wills
and
the
withdrawal
or
refusal
of
life
sustaining
medical
treatment.
at
the
same
time,
however,
voters
and
legislators
continue
to
reaffirm
the
longstanding
prohibition
on
assisting
suicide.
turning
now,
the
respondent’s
constitutional
claim,
it
is
established
that
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
heightened
protection
for
certain
fundamental
rights
such
as
the
right
to
marry,
to
have
children,
to
refuse
unwanted
medical
treatment.
out
of
respect
for
the
democratic
process
and
to
prevent
judges
from
over
reaching
in
its
often
difficult
area,
we
have
repeatedly
emphasized
that
fundamental
rights
are
those
that
are
deeply
rooted
in
our
nation’s
tradition.
we
have
also
insisted
that
the
fundamental
right
at
issue
in
a
particular
due
process
case
be
framed
rather
precisely.
thus,
the
issue
before
us
today
is
not
the
broad
question
of
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
determine
the
time
and
manner
of
one’s
death
but
instead
whether
the
liberty
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
includes
a
right
to
commit
physician-assisted
suicide.
to
hold
for
respondents,
we
would
have
to
reverse
centuries
of
legal
doctrine
and
practice
and
strike
down
the
considered
policy
choice
of
almost
every
state.
respondent’s
argument
is
supported
neither
by
tradition
nor
by
our
case
in
cruzan
decision.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
asserted
right
to
assistant
in
committing
suicide
is
not
a
fundamental
liberty
interest
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
we
also
conclude
that
it
is
rationally
related
to
legitimate
state
interest.
washington
has
valid
interest
in
protecting
all
human
lives
from
beginning
to
end
and
preventing
suicide,
treating
depression,
preserving
the
integrity
and
ethics
of
the
medical
profession,
and
in
protecting
the
poor,
the
elderly,
and
disabled
persons
from
abuse,
neglect,
and
prejudice
and
in
preventing
a
netherlands
style
slide
to
voluntary
and
perhaps
even
involuntary
euthanasia.
we
therefore
hold
that
washington’s
ban
on
assisted
suicide
does
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
join
in
part;
justices
stevens,
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
