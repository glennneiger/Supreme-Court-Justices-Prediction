justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
you
referred
to
the...
your
sister
state
oregon's
experience.
and
one
of
the
most
powerful
arguments
in
support
of
your
position
in
this
case
is
legislatures
might
adopt
the
remedy
rather
than
the
courts.
is
it
your
view
that
a
legislature
does
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
authorize
assisted
suicide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
district
court
in
that
case
disagreed
with
that,
i
think,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you're
not
endorsing
the
ninth
circuit's
position,
though?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
your
argument
there
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
filings
in
this
case.
there
are
also
sorts
of
active
filings
of
amicus
briefs
that
indicate
there
is
very
strong
political
support
for
the
contrary
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
before
you
finish
to
tell
us
as
best
you
can
how
you
would
define
the
liberty
interest
on
which
you
rely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
as
a
result
of
death,
you
mean
withdrawal
that
will
result
in
death?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
legal
line
is
bright
and
understandable.
is
the
real
practice
as
clear
a
line
as
you
define?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
thinking
so
much
of
studies
of
data
that's
not
in
the
public
domain
generally,
but
the
one
historical
thing
that
i
can't
get
totally
out
of
mind
is
i'm
not
aware
of
any
doctor
ever
being
convicted
of
committing
this
particular
offense;
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
hard
to
believe
it
has
never
been
committed.
