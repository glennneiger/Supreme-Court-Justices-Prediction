justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
then
what
happens
under
your
analysis?
i
take
it
your
analysis
is
you
find
some
kind
of
basic
right
or
liberty
interest
in
the
avoidance
of
the
most
serious
pain
and
suffering
and,
moreover,
we've
been
submitted...
we've
had
submitted
what
i
think
of
as
a
gigantic
brandeis'ed
brief,
which
presents
all
kinds
of
empirically-based
judgment
by
those
who
know,
though
they
don't
always
agree,
about
what
the
conditions
are
in
which
you
find
justification,
few
people
seriously
need
undergo
terrible
pain.
and
the
risks
of
killing
people
who
shouldn't
be
killed
are
great.
on
that
analysis,
what
happens
if
three
years
passes
and
it
turns
out
that,
instead
of
more
people
actually
getting
the
hospice
treatment,
instead
of
people
being
able
to
go
to
hospices
and
have
opiates
to
relieve
pain,
what
happens
is
instead
of
25
percent
not
getting
that
treatment,
50
percent
don't
get
it?
suppose
for
doctors
being
afraid
or
people
changing
their
mind
about
the
double
effect
or
any
of
those
conditions
change
so
that
people
really
don't
get
the
pain-relieving
medication
that
is
possible,
then
what
happens
to
the
law
under
your
theory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they
don't,
suppose
they
just
don't
do
it,
you
have
25
percent
now,
suppose
that
number
keeps
going
up,
then
suppose
new
york
changes
its
law
about
the
double
effect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
then
do
you
react?
i
would
be
very
interested
in
getting
your
reaction.
because
however
you
define
the
liberty
interest,
there
are
tremendously
difficult
procedural
questions
of
what
would
be
the
safeguards
of
voluntariness,
a
much
more
difficult
question
on...
when
you
go
into
it
than
what
you
might
think.
and
how
do
you
decide
terminal
condition.
and
what
about
the
relationship
of
laws
like
double
effect
and
all
of
that
area.
why...
what's
your
response
to
the
proposition
that
these
different
groups,
interacting
with
the
legislature,
are
far
more
suited,
that
legislature,
to
come
up
with
an
answer
than
a
court
writing
a
constitutional
provision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
be
interested
in
your
definition
of
the
liberty
interest
as
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
they
recommended
that.
i
mean,
the
report
as
i
read
it,
the
english
report,
recommends
this
as
a
line
various...
and
one
of
the
things
that
impressed
me
about
looking
at
that
is
they
said,
in
holland,
where
they
have
the
different
line,
there
were
three
centers
to
deal
with
palliative
care,
pain
removal.
and
in
england,
where
they
have
the
new
york
law,
there
were
185.
do
you
see
the
conclusion
that
they're
drawing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suppose
the
legislature
comes
to
us
and
says,
hey,
that's
what
we
want
and
that's
the
reason
we're
more
interested
in
people
dying
without
suffering,
we've
looked
at
this
information,
we
think
this
is
the
way
to
do
it,
just
the
way
they
recommended
in
the
report.
what
are
we
supposed
to
say
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
going
back...
you
have
several
parts
to
it.
and
the
parts
each
have
precedental
effect,
and
you're
putting
the
several
parts
together.
one
of
parts
is
pain
and
suffering.
what
in
the
history,
what
in
the
history
of
the
decisions
shows
something...
a
personal
right
against
enduring
pain
and
suffering,
if
you
go
back
into
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
i
mean,
but...
i'm
not
saying
it
would
be
in
certain
contexts
only.
but
what
is
there--
