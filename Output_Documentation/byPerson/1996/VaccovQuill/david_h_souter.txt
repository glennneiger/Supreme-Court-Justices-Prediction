--but,
when
you
say
it's
consistent
medical
practice,
i
take
it
you
mean,
but
if
i'm
wrong,
tell
me,
i
take
it
you
mean
that,
once
you
accept
the
right
of
a
patient
to
withdraw
all
life
support
including
hydration
and
feeding,
then
the
only
way
to
prevent
excruciating
pain
as
the
person
nears
death
is
with
these
extraordinarily
high
dosages
of
painkiller
that
induce
coma.
so
that
your
justification
for
the
painkiller
and
the
coma
is
essentially
your
justification
for
preventing
excruciating
pain
which
is
caused
by
a
decision
which
the
individual
has
a
right
to
make.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
not
merely
that
the
doctors
have
been
doing
this.
the
argument
is
that
it's
justifiable
essentially
on
the
ground
that
the
right
to
withdraw
life
support
is
recognized
and
the
right
to
ameliorate
pain
is
recognized.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
reason
you
draw
the
line
ultimately
between
ending
the
life
support
and
the
affirmative
act
of
giving
the
pill,
is
it
essentially
a
line
that
depends
on
the
argument
for
risk
of
abuse?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
grant
you
that
it
was.
but
we're
being
asked
to
justify
that
line
today.
and
my
question
is,
is
your
principal
justification
for
that
line
the
risk
of
abuse
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
there
a
risk
of
abuse
that
those
who
might
stand
to
profit
or
at
least
themselves
risk
further
discomfort
by
an
early
death
for
a
person
on
life
support
will
try
to
coerce
or
persuade
that
person
to
end
life
support
when
it
really
isn't
a
voluntary
decision,
why
isn't
that
a
risk?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
far
greater
with
respect
to
those
who,
in
fact,
are
truly
terminally
ill?
or
is
it
far
greater
because
it
affects
a
broader
class
than
the
terminally
ill?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
with
your
cocounsel
in
this
case
that,
in
fact,
it
also
reflects
a
difference
in
risk
assessment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
tribe,
you
say
they've
fallen
into
it
and
you
referred
in
answering
justice
breyer
a
moment
ago
to
the
state
laboratories
operating
with
the
lights
out.
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
the
issue
that
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
really
serious
legislative
issue,
is
fairly
recent.
20
years
ago
we
weren't
even
reading
about
this.
so
that
the
fact
may
be
and
the
metaphor
may
be
right,
that
the
lights
have
been
out,
but
the
effort
to
put
the
lights
on
is
fairly
recent.
and
doesn't...
doesn't
that
sort
of
put
some
punch
behind
justice
breyer's
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
the
voice
just
arrive
when
death
is
imminent?
