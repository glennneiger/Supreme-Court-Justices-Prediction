justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
take
it
the
example
or
the
hypothetical,
taken
either
way,
that
we're
considering,
is
a
person...
consider
that
the
asset,
is
a
terminally
ill
person
on
a
life
support
system.
and
that
person
makes
the
choice
to
have
the
life
support
system
withdrawn.
let's
assume
that
death
will
take
10
to
20
days
and
that
there
will
be
considerable
pain.
the
state
of
new
york
would
prevent
that
person
from
receiving
a
lethal
injection;
is
that
not
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
support
that
distinction
based
on
these
other
factors;
namely,
the
long-standing
tradition
against
permitting
suicide?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
hypothetical
that
i
put,
patient
a
is
going
to
have
10
to
20-day
lingering,
painful
death;
patient
b
in
exactly
the
same
position
wants
to
unhook
the
life
system
and
have
the
lethal
dose?
in
light
of
your
position
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest
in
obtaining
medication
to
prevent
pain,
how
is
this
distinction
between
these
two
people
compatible
with
a
heightened
scrutiny?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
could
agree
with
that.
but
i
don't
think
you
need
heightened
scrutiny
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
suppose
it's
based
on
the
distinction
between
allowing
events
to
take
their
own
course
and
third-person
intervention,
which
the
law
has
recognized
in
the
law
of
torts
and
in
most
of
its
other
substantive
areas
for
centuries.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
but
when
a
person
on
a
life
support
system
wants
the
systems
discontinued,
she
is
not
committing
suicide,
which
is
what
you
said
earlier.
she
is
not
doing
that,
she's
allowing
nature
to
take
its
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
they
have
less
light
than
we
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
new
york
report,
and
perhaps
this
will
get
you
to
the
autonomy
interest
and
it
bridges
what
justice
breyer
and
justice
souter
suggested,
that
we're
just
beginning
to
get
a
public
awareness
and
to
find
out
much
more
about
these
things.
the
new
york
report,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
brandeis
brief
for
the
proposition
that
the
autonomy
that
you
suggest,
that
you
wish
to
protect,
or
that
you
wish
to
create,
is
illusory,
it's
chimerical,
that
there
will
be
less
autonomy,
less
autonomy,
by
the
unanimous
judgment
of
the
members
of
that
task
force,
if
you
allow
the
option
that
you
choose.
in
fact,
you
will
be
introducing
fear
into
medical
care
facilities.
you
will
diminish,
diminish
the
choices,
not
increase
them.
that's
what
i
get
from
the
new
york
report.
and
i
would
appreciate
your
comment
on
that.
justice
kennedy,
i
think
as
i
read
the
report,
the
premise
of
that
proposition
was
that
people
would
be
fearful
that
doctors
would
be
making
decisions
in
the
end
that
would
terminate
their
lives.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the...
if
anyone
reads
that
report
as
you
have,
as
i
have,
and
thinks
about
what
happens
in
the
hospital
wards
when
terminal
sedation
is
given,
when
the
morphine
drip
is
increased,
when
the
person
is
asleep
and
it's
said
that
they
wanted
the
respirator
disconnected
but
there
are
no
required
witnesses,
that's
pretty
scary.
and
what
i
suggest
is
that
the
new
york
legislature,
which
initially
outlawed
all
physician-assisted
suicide,
not
by
identifying
physicians,
but
by
just
saying
if
a
helps
b
commit
suicide,
it's
a
crime,
now
confronts
a
rather
different
regime,
a
regime
that
says
near
the
end
of
life,
whether
or
not
the
intent
of
somebody
is
deliberately
to
die,
if
certain
techniques
are
used,
combination
of
morphine
and
barbiturates,
a
surgical
removal
of
something
implanted,
we
don't
call
that
suicide
and
actually
we
don't
regulate
it
very
much.
but,
on
the
other
side,
if
the
patient
is
prescribed,
at
the
patient's
request,
a
lethal
drug,
we
make
that
absolutely
forbidden.
that
combination
which
has
not
been
chosen
by
the
legislature,
when
mr.
vacco
held
up
that
report
and
said,
this
is
the
choice
of
people
of
new
york
and
i
wondered
what
his
answer
was
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
who
is
the
we,
new
york
in
its
legislature
did
nothing
in
response
that
to
that
report.
that
is,
they
didn't
change
the
law,
but
that
was
inaction.
the
line,
it's
like
thompson
v.
oklahoma.
when
oklahoma
passed
some
laws
that
had
the
unfortunate
consequence
of
exposing
15-year-olds
to
execution
and,
justice
o'connor,
you
concluded
that
you
didn't
have
to
reach
the
ultimate
merits
of
whether
that
was
unconstitutional,
because
that
was
really
a
question
that
didn't
have
to
be
decided.
it
was
at
least
constitutionally
dubious
as
i
suggest
the
rationality
of
this
line
is
at
least
constitutionally
dubious.
that
was
a
concurring
both
that
in
the
end
sent
the
thing
back
to
oklahoma
and
said
if
you
really
need
to
execute
15-year-olds,
tell
us
that.
