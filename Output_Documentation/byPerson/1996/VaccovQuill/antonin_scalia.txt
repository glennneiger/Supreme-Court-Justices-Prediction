end
stages
of
their
life.
can
the
state,
if
someone
goes
on
a
hunger
strike
and
wants
to
die
to
protest
something
or
other,
can
the
state
force-feed
that
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
so
you're
drawing
the
same
line
that
was
drawn
in
the
last
argument,
that
there's
something
special
about
the
last
hours
of
death
that
creates
a
liberty
interest,
but
before
that
there's
no
liberty
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
want
to
limit
the
discretion
of
the
new
york
legislature
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
an
individual
who
says
i'm
on
a
hunger
strike,
i
do
not
want
to
be
force-fed.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
talking
about
what
you
do,
i'm
talking
about
what
you
may
do.
are
you
equating
sensible
results
with
what
the
constitution
requires?
i
agree
the
line
you've
drawn
is
a
very
sensible
one.
but
you're
coming
here
and
saying
that
is
the
line
that
the
constitution
imposes.
that,
had
you
tried
to
do
the
other,
you
would
be
reversed
because
it
is
unconstitutional.
isn't
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
consititution
is
what
is
sensible
and
good;
is
that
right?
and
new
york
state
may
not
err
and
do
something
that
is
foolish.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
disagree,
mr.
tribe,
if
i
understand
it,
with
counsel
for
respondent
in
the
prior
case,
who
asserted
that
it
was
not
only
rational
but
that
there
is
a
constitutional
line
between
suicide
of
those
who
are
at
the
threshold
of
death
and
the
suicide
of
the
young
and
healthy
but
despondent.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
it's
irrational,
but
it
can
make
an
exception
between--
justice
antonin
scalia
--tell
me
why.
you're
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
is
it
a
technique
or
is
it
the
distinction
between
action
and
inaction?
the
state
allows
someone
to
not
provide
medical
assistance
but
forbids
someone
from
injecting
something
that
will
cause
death?
surely
you
don't
assert
that
the
distinction
between
action
and
inaction
is
irrational?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
you
just
object
to
the
taking
out
of
the
tube.
if
the
issue
were
simply
i
don't
want
a
tube
put
in
in
the
first
place--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
would
have
no
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
would
have
no
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean...
do
you
mean
nothing
more
by
terminal
sedation
than
the
sedation
of
those
who
are
terminal?
justice
antonin
scalia
sort
of
a
legislative
process
requirement
in
the
constitution,
legislative
due
process?
i
thought
we
had
specifically
disclaimed
the
existence
of
any
such
thing.
i
mean,
the
law
is
either
good
or
bad.
you're
telling
us
if
the
legislature
goes
about
doing
it
one
way,
it's
okay;
if
it
goes
about
doing
it
another
way,
it's
not
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
mean
to
do
that,
that
was
a
mistake.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
this
is
in
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
this
is
lovely
philosophy.
but
you
want
us
to
frame
a
constitutional
rule
on
the
basis
of
that?
life
has
various
stages,
birth,
death--
