mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
must
remain
neutral
in
the
face
of
a
decision
of
one
of
its
citizens
to
help
another
kill
herself.
the
second
circuit
below
said
yes,
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection.
it
is
new
york's
view,
however,
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
this
to
be
the
case.
indeed,
equal
protection
is
not
implicated
at
all
in
this
case.
patients
who
withdraw
from
life
support
are
not
similarly
situated
to
terminally
ill
people
who
are
seeking
physician-assisted
suicide.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
the
equal
protection
clause
is
indeed
not
offended,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
any
event
we
also
believe
that
these,
these
two
acts
are
similarly
not
situated
and
there
are
six
primary
reasons
why
we
believe
so.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
justice
ginsburg,
simply
put,
the
people
that
you
describe,
or
that
the
second
circuit
described,
are
not
similarly
situated.
in
the
first
context
the
individual
who
is
at
the,
in
terminal
illness,
at
the
end
stages
of
their
life
as
the
second
circuit
defined
it,
are
exercising
their
right,
which
in
new
york
state
is
recognized
by
not
only
the
common
law,
but
by
our
new
york
state
constitution,
their
right
to
refuse
treatment.
that
right
which
has
been
recognized
for
centuries
as
springing
from
the
common
law,
the
right
of
being
free
from
bodily
interference,
the
right
to
be
free
from
battery.
in
the
context
of
saying
that
they
are
refusing
treatment,
individuals,
terminally
ill
or
otherwise,
are
merely
asserting
that
right
to
be
let
alone.
on
the
contrary,
and
in
contrast,
are
those
individuals
who
are
not
asserting
a
right,
that
is,
a
bodily
defensive
right,
their
rights
to
bodily
integrity,
but
instead
attempting
to
assert,
as
the
plaintiff
respondents
in
this
case
are
claiming,
that
there
is
some
right
to
have
a
third
party,
in
this
instance
physicians,
help
kill
themselves.
and
we
believe
that
these
two
acts
are
clearly
distinguishable.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
justice
ginsburg,
in
all
due
respect,
i
disagree.
the
notion
of
sedation,
and
by
the
way,
we
happen
to
believe
that
the
respondents
have
misstated
it
factually
and
legally
in
their
brief,
but
the
notion
of
sedation
as
recognized
by
the
vast
majority
of
the
medical
professionals,
is
a
notion
of
sedation
in
the
imminently
dying.
when
individuals
are
actually
in
the
last
hours
of
death,
sedation
is
for
the
purpose
of
treating
four
distinct
symptoms,
nausea,
shortness
of
breath,
delirium,
and
excruciating
pain.
and
only
when
these
symptoms
are
intractable--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
mr.
chief
justice,
as
the
medical
professionals
have
written
in
their
briefs
and
even
the
articles
that
are
alluded
to
in
the
various
briefs
will
indicate,
the
medication
that
is
provided
in
these
limited
circumstances
is
provided
only
for
the
very
limited
effort
to
control
those
four
symptoms
that
i
articulated.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
i
am
taking
that
terminology
and
that
phraseology
from
the
medical
professionals.
the
correct
phrase
in
a
medical
context
is
sedation
in
the
imminently
dying,
not
terminal
sedation
as
referred
to
in
the
respondents'
brief.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
justice
ginsburg,
again
i
believe
that
the
description
of
this
by
the
plaintiff
respondents
is
simply
incorrect.
what
really
transpires...
again
the
medication
which
is
designed
to
deal
with
four
specific
symptoms
is
only
administered
to
the
extent
that
it
will
deal
with
those
symptoms.
and
the
suggestion
that
the
death
is
brought
upon
by
virtue
of
a
coma
coupled
with
the
termination
of
nutrition
and
hydration
is
simply
wrong.
most
medical
professionals
will
agree
that
the
death
from
the
underlying
illness
or,
if
the
drugs
are
going
to
suppress
respiration
so
critically,
that
death
will
come
from
those
two
reasons
long
before
it
comes
from
starvation
as
a
result
of
the
withdrawal
of
nutrition
and
hydration.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
justice
ginsburg,
it's
rationally
distinguishable
because
it
is
consistent
medical
practice.
it
has
never
been...
the
concept
of
providing
drugs
specifically
and
solely
for
the
purpose
of
killing
someone
has
never
been
embraced
by
the
medical
profession.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
yes,
essentially,
justice
souter.
and
the
concept
of--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--yes.
and
indeed
the
subsequent
administration
of
the
palliative
care
drugs
is
consistent
with
the
long-standing
notion
of
the
double
effect,
that
the
drugs
in
that
instance
are
not
being
administered
for
the
purpose
of
causing
the
death,
they
are
administered
in
the
context
of
the
post
refusal
or
post
withdrawal
of
treatment
palliative
care
of
the
patient.
and
those...
that
is
indeed
distinguishable
from
the
act
of
purposely
and
intentionally
providing
a
drug
to
kill
the
patient.
and
the
state...
besides
the
fact
that
the
state
believes
that
these
two
acts
are
indeed
not
similar,
the
state
also
believes
that
there
are
several
legitimate
interests
that
we
have
in
regulating
the
process
of
physician-assisted
suicide
in
new
york
state
as
we
have,
which
is
by
virtue
of
an
outright
ban.
new
york
has
chosen
to
draw
its
line
in
a
rational
and
indeed
in
the
same
rational
place
that
virtually
every
state
in
the
nation
has
drawn
that
line.
this
line
that
we
have
drawn
in
new
york
state
is
vigorously
supported
by
professionals,
particularly
those--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--yes,
justice
ginsberg,
indeed
we
do
assert
that
the
state
of
new
york's
legislature,
if
it
so
chose,
could
indeed
make
a
judgment
in
the
opposite
direction.
what
we
are
here
today
to
say
is
that
from
new
york's
position,
they
should
not
be
constitutionally
compelled
or
constitutionally
required
to
make
those
judgments
or
to
change
the
line
which
is
indeed
a
rational
and
principled
line.
new
york
has
made
this
judgment,
and
in
some
fashion
that
judgment
has
been
based
upon
the
widely
quoted
new
york
state
task
force
on
life
and
the
law,
which
over
a
nine-year
period
conducted
an
exhaustive
study
on
health
care
in
new
york
state.
and,
while
this
study
recognizes
that
there
is
needs
for
advancement
in
treating
pain
and
recognizing
symptoms
of
depression
that
lead
to
suicidal
ideation,
this
task
force
report,
which
has
been
embraced
by
the
new
york
state
legislature,
quite
succinctly
and
specifically
says
we
should
not
embrace
the
concept
of
physician-assisted
suicide
because
of
the
fear
that
it
leads
to
euthanasia.
and
most
of
this
report
deals
with
the
risks
of
physician-assisted
suicide.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that,
if
the
new
york
state
legislature
or
for
that
matter
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
had
decided
differently
on
the
issue
of
refusal
of
treatment
than
they
have
already,
that
we
would
be
back
here
in
another
context
discussing
the
right
of
an
individual
to
have
the
ability
to
refuse
treatment.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
i
don't
believe
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
could
constitutionally
prohibit
the
ability
of
a
patient
in
the
end
stages
of
their
life
to
refuse
treatment.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
no,
i'm
not
drawing
the
same
line,
justice
scalia.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
the...
indeed
the
discretion
of
the
new
york
state
legislature
would
only
be
limited
to
the,
to
an
individual's
right
to
refuse...
right
to
refuse
treatment.
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--that's
a
different
circumstance
than
an
individual
who
is
by
virtue
of
medical
treatment
being
force-fed,
by
virtue
of
some
tubes
that
are
implanted
into
his
person.
that
person,
his
bodily
integrity
has
been
violated,
and
that
is
distinguishable
from
the
individual
who
is
otherwise
healthy
and
merely
says
that
i
am
not
going
to
eat
for
the
purposes
of
killing
myself.
indeed,
in
new
york
state,
we
have
said
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
state
to
intervene
and
prevent
that
person
from
killing
himself.
and
indeed
in--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
indeed
this
court
said
in
cruzan
that,
in
the
context
of
an
individual
who
is
otherwise
healthy,
that
the
state
need
not
stand
by
neutrally
in
the
face
of
somebody
who
is
attempting
to
commit
suicide.
in
new
york
state,
where
we
have
an
individual...
an
individual,
for
instance,
who
is
incarcerated
in
our
correctional
facility
and
goes
on
a
hunger
strike
is
otherwise
healthy,
competent,
and
goes
on
a
hunger
strike
asserting
his
interest
in
suicide,
the
state
indeed
in
our
estimation
has
the
ability
to
say
we
are
not
going
to
stand
by
quietly
to
allow
you
to
kill
yourself.
and
that's
not
inconsistent
with
the
tradition
of
the
law
in
new
york
state
and
indeed
the
tradition
of
law
in
terms
of
suicide
going
back
to
the
time
of
blackstone.
where
we
have
said
in
new
york
state,
while
we
haven't
criminalized
suicide,
and
we
have
long
not
criminalized
attempted
suicide,
we
still
have
put
barriers,
social
and
societal
and
legal
barriers
to
signal
our
interest
in
people
not
performing
suicide.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
the
decision
that
i
speak
to
in
the
context
of
the
example
that
i
posed
is
a
decision
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals,
but
it's
not
inconsistent,
for
instance,
with
legislation--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--that
decision
affected
a
prisoner
in
the
state
correctional
facility
who
was
indeed
on
a
hunger
strike,
announced
a
hunger
strike
for
the
purposes
of
committing
suicide
and
he
wanted
to
starve
himself.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
no,
justice
o'connor,
new
york
cannot.
in
the
context
of
refusing
treatment,
whether
it's
terminally
ill
or
otherwise,
whether
it's
the
16-year-old
who
has
been
told
to
go
home
and
take
two
aspirin
or
the
97-year-old
who
is
plugged
into
various
medical
devices,
we
respect
in
new
york
state
that
person's
right
to
refuse
treatment.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
i
am
suggesting--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--justice
scalia,
in
the
context
of
equal
protection,
the
constitution
says
that
the
state
may
do
what
is
rational.
and
we
believe
that
the
line
that
we
have
drawn
here
in
this
case
is
indeed
rational.
and
it's
based
upon
some
very
serious
and
compelling
state
interests.
and
among
those
interests
is
probably
primarily
the
interest
in
avoiding
abuse
here.
we
already
know
in
the
context
of
our--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--justice
souter,
in
all
due
respect,
i
believe
that
the
line
was
drawn
much
longer
ago
than
the
time
that
the
notion
of
assisted
suicide--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--the
principal...
yes,
the
principal
justification
indeed,
one
of
the
most
compelling
reasons,
state
interest,
is
the
risk
of
abuse.
and
that
abuse
is
going
to
manifest
itself
in
a
variety--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--justice
souter,
there
is
no
question
that
in
certain
instances
there
is
an
overlapping
of
the
risk
of
abuse.
but
we
believe
in
the
context
of
physician-assisted
suicide.
the
risk
of
abuse
is
far
greater.
simply
put,
when
you
terminate--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--it's
for
both
reasons,
in
our
estimation.
in
the
context
of
the
terminally
ill,
now
we
move
into
the
area
of
risk
of
error
which
leads
to
abuse.
who
is
to
define
terminally
ill,
how
do
we
define
it
with
such
certainty?
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
it's
a
minimal
risk,
justice
ginsburg,
because
we
can
indeed
treat
virtually
all
forms
of
pain.
the
medical
professionalism
from
the
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
point
out
the
fact
that
pain
is
indeed
manageable.
and
as
my
colleague
from
the
state
of
washington
indicated,
unfortunately
we
just
don't
do
a
good
enough
job
in
america
of
treating
the
pain.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
then,
justice
o'connor,
if
the
purposes
of
that
sedation
is
to
bring
about
the
death
as
opposed
to
treating
the
symptoms
of
the
pain--
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
--in
the
context
of
treating
the
pain,
even
though
there
is
a
risk
of
death,
pursuant
to
the
principle
of
double
effect,
that
is
not
criminal
conduct
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
dennis
c.
vacco
thank
you.
