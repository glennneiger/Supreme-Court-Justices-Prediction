mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
would
begin
with
justice
ginsburg's
question
to
the
solicitor
general
about
winks
and
nods.
i
don't
think
the
issue
really
is
whether
there
are
some
people
who
violate
existing
laws
like
the
law
in
new
york
which,
as
i
hope
to
explain
in
a
minute,
really
makes
it
legal
to
do
what
is
described
in
a
rather
powerful
article
in
the
bioethics
brief
in
support
of
respondents
as
slow
euthanasia.
i
don't
think
so
much
the
issue
is
how
many
people
violate
the
law.
charlatans,
doctors
of
death,
just
by
the
nature
of
it
they
operate
in
the
dark
and
we
don't
know.
the
winks
and
nods
i
think
affect
the
capacity
of
the
system
to
respond
humanely
and
rationally
to
what
is
actually
going
on
rather
than
just
to
bright
line
hypotheticals.
the
winks
and
nods
really
relate
to
things
that
we
all
accept,
the
principle
of
double
effect.
just
as
justice
souter
asked
the
question,
take
one
of
our
patient
plaintiffs,
the
jane
doe.
she
had
a
tumor
that
wrapped
itself
around
her
esophagus.
result,
she
couldn't
eat.
so
she
had
the
choice,
she
could
have
said
no,
don't
give
me
a
feeding
tube.
she
acceded
to
having
a
feeding
tube
implanted.
it
had
to
be
surgically
implanted
because
it
couldn't
be
done
nasogastrically
because
jane
doe
really
didn't
have
an
esophagus
left.
as
she
neared
death,
and
indeed
only
nine
days
passed
between
the
filing
of
her
declaration
and
her
demise,
as
she
neared
death,
she
was,
as
are
many
patients
in
the
modern
world
who
die
not
rapidly
of
an
infection
but
at
the
end
of
a
long,
degenerative
process,
she
was
the
recipient
of
all
sorts
of
medical
interventions
that
she
could
have
said
no
to.
some
of
them
really
weren't
life-saving;
they
just
prevented
even
greater
torment,
agony,
disintegration,
and
then
she
did
have
a
choice,
she
could
have
chosen
on
the
theory
i
suppose
that,
even
though
her
rabbi
said
you
can't
step
in
the
same
river
twice,
she
could
have
turned
back
the
clock,
she
could
have
said
no
to
tube,
she
could
now
say
take
out
the
tube,
i
don't
want
it
here
anymore.
and
as
the
law
of
new
york
is
now
structured,
because
she
is
terminally
ill,
there
is
no
inquiry
into
her
intent.
even
if
it
were
undisputed
that
the
only
reason
she
wanted
the
tube
out
was
that
that
would
enable
her
to
die
a
little
bit
sooner,
that
would
be
irrelevant.
it's
not
irrelevant
when
you
force-feed
someone,
however,
that
is
in
the
context
of
mark
chapman,
the
guy
who
was
force-fed
in
the
new
york
case,
the
murderer
of
beatle
john
lennon,
it
was
decisive,
that
the
reason
he
didn't
want
food
was
not
that
he
just
didn't
like
it,
he
was
anorexic
or
something,
it
was
that
that
was
his
way
of
trying
to
kill
himself.
and
so
his
bodily
integrity
had
to
give
way.
that
is,
he
could
be
force-fed
under
new
york
law.
but,
being
terminally
ill,
jane
doe
couldn't
be
force-fed.
and
i
don't
think
much
should
turn
on
the
label
of
whether
you
call
a
tube
a
treatment
or,
as
the
chief
justice
asked,
what
in
the
world
difference
does
it
make
if
it's
a
tube
or
a
spoon,
it's
an
invasion
of
your
bodily
integrity
which
is
where
this
principle
supposedly
comes
from.
so
to
begin
with,
we
have
this
question:
jane
doe
has
the
right
to
have
the
tube
removed
because
she's
dying
anyway.
mark
chapman
didn't
have
a
right
not
to
be
force-fed.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
second
circuit,
mr.
chief
justice,
did
base
its
ruling
on
the
equal
protection
principle
that
mark
chapman,
i
think
helps
me
illustrate.
they
didn't
talk
about
john
lennon
or
mark
chapman.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
true
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
particular
fellow.
but
it
was
the
arbitrariness
of
the
following
scheme
in
new
york
law,
which
i
think
you
can
give
you
a
quick
picture
of,
the
scheme
that
the
second
circuit
thought
was
irrational.
the
scheme
was
that,
despite
your
interest
in
bodily
integrity,
if
you're
not
terminally
ill,
the
state
allows
an
invasion
of
the
body
in
those
cases
where
you're
trying
to
kill
yourself.
so
that
if
the
woman
in
the
fosmire
case,
which
was
referred
to
in
the
briefs,
i
think
it's
page
11
or
12
of
our
brief,
if
the
woman
in
the
fosmire
case,
instead
of
saying
no
to
blood
transfusions
after
a
cesarean
section
for
religious
reasons
had
slashed
her
wrists
and
said,
i
don't
want
blood
transfusions,
bodily
integrity,
no
question
under
new
york
law,
as
the
court
made
clear
in
footnote
2,
that
could
be
overridden.
but
what
now
happens
when
someone
is
terminally
ill
and
dying,
even
if
it
is
undisputed
that
the
reason
the
person
says,
no
blood
transfusions,
take
out
the
tube,
is
to
commit
suicide.
at
that
point
the
state
says,
we
don't
care
about
your
reason,
the
technology
is
what
makes
the
difference.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
justice
scalia,
i
did
not
say--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
can
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
justice
scalia,
it's
not
irrational--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--because
for
purposes
of
defining
a
particular
liberty,
recognizing
a
greater
freedom
to
decide
this
amount
of
agony
is
enough,
it
may
make
a
difference
whether
someone
is
dying
or
healthy
and
just
temporarily
disabled.
but
for
purposes
of
drawing
a
distinction
among
technologies,
saying
we
don't
care
when
you're
young
and
healthy
whether
the
way
you're
trying
kill
yourself
is
by
saying
unplug
that
respirator
or
give
me
a
lethal
medication.
and,
however,
drawing
that
very
line
for
the
terminally
ill,
for
the
terminally
ill
they
say
we
do
care.
that
is,
jane
doe
didn't
want
the
surgical
removal
of
the
tube
because
that
would
have
left
her
in
starving
and
dehydration...
not
just
discomfort
but
according
to
dr.
grossman
agony
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
she
didn't
want
to
be
turned
into
a
zombie,
she
wouldn't
have
accepted
terminal
sedation.
but
she
had
the
right,
that
is,
whether
she
could
end
her
life
because
she
was
in
that
small
group
that
the
solicitor
general
describes
as
having
really
no
choice
between
agony
and
unconsciousness,
even
with
the
best
palliative
care,
whether
she
could
do
that,
terms
under
new
york
law,
when
she's
in
this
terminal
phase,
not
on
her
intent
but
just
on
the
particular
technique
involved.
now
if
the
new
york
legislature--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
i
suggest,
justice
scalia,
that
even
though
the
action/inaction
distinction
that
you
criticized
in
cruzan
isn't
quite
irrational,
the
distinction
between
these
two
different
kinds
of
action,
the
action
that
is
requested
of
someone,
operate
on
me
to
take
out
the
tube,
and
the
action,
please
give
me
a
lethal
prescription,
that
operates
irrationally.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
the
first
place.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
there
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
that's
right.
i
would
be
an
action/inaction
advocate,
although
i
do
think,
if
it
were
demonstrable,
as
i
think
it's
true
in
new
york,
that
someone
who,
for
example,
slashed
her
wrists
and
said,
no
action
has
been
taken
yet,
don't
put
the
iv
in
me,
if
new
york
says
to
her,
sorry,
we're
going
do
it
anyway
and
overrides
her
bodily
integrity
in
order
to
prevent
what
it
calls
suicide,
but
then
tells
someone
else
who
is
in
the
process
of
dying
and
is
10
or
11
days
from
death,
for
you
we
are
not
going
to
worry
about
the
intent
that
you
have--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg.
a
liberty
problem
of
a
different
sort
might
become
even
more
severe.
but
the
point
is...
and
again,
i'm
sorry
to
go
back
to
a
certain
kind
of
reality...
you
don't
suddenly
become
terminally
ill
at
midnight
on
a
given
day.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
i
can
get
to
it,
i'll
try
to
discuss
how
one
might
deal
with
that,
but
if
i
might
just
stick
with
equal
protection
for
a
moment.
what
happens
to
people
as
they
degenerate
is
that
they
are
given
all
kinds
of
treatments
and
they
accept
them,
and
this
idea
that
at
the
end
you're
either
in
this
closed
class
of
people
who
luckily
have
a
plug
that
can
be
pulled,
or
you're
in
some
other
group,
is
a
fantasy.
every
case,
or
virtually
every
case--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
kennedy,
none
of
these
patients
is
in
a
state
of
nature.
they're
in
a
hospital
or
a
hospice.
and
they're
receiving
chemotherapy,
radiation,
bone
marrow
transplants--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
i
could
explore
nature
just
for
a
moment.
of
course,
it's
up
to
the
state
of
new
york
how
to
characterize
whether
she's
committing
suicide.
but
as
you've
said
in
your
colorado
opinion,
the
government's
characterization
can't
control
the
constitutional
analysis.
new
york
says
that
if
a
person...
suppose
there's
a
car
accident,
and
my
wife
and
i...
no,
i
won't
be
personal.
suppose
it's
a
car
accident
and
two
people
are
in
the
car.
one
of
them
is
so
badly
injured
that
the
person
is
bound
to
die
within
a
few
weeks.
the
other
person
is
not
quite
that
badly
injured
at
all
but
needs
a
respirator
for
a
while.
and
is
in
a
coma.
the
respirator
is
put
on,
so
we
don't
have
justice
ginsburg's
problems
of...
well,
you've
signed
up,
now
you're
stuck...
the
person
is
in
a
coma,
the
respirator
is
put
on,
wakes
up
and
is
delighted
to
learn
that
he's
going
to
be
fine
in
a
couple
of
weeks,
unless
the
respirator
is
taken
off,
in
which
case
he
will
asphyxiate.
so
he
has
no
objection
to
the
respirator.
he
learns
that
his
spouse,
his
wife,
is
dying
and
she's
not
going
to
make
it
no
matter
what.
she
as
it
happens
is
not
on
a
respirator,
she's
on
all
kinds
of
stuff
but
none
of
them
have
a
detachable
plug.
new
york
says
to
him
when...
he
says,
well,
now
that
i
know
what's
happened
to
my
wife,
i
want
to
die,
take
the
respirator
out.
i
think
under
footnote
2
of
fosmire,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
that,
he
would
be
using--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
court
did
say
that
in
that
case
that
the
prison
context
did
not
determine
the
outcome.
and
i
do
suggest
that,
given
the
complexity
and
difficulty
of
the
area,
the
desire
to
have
an
easy
answer
for
the
whole
country
mightn't
work,
that's
not
what
i
would
propose.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
breyer,
my
answer
is
in
part
equal
protection
and
in
part
judge
calabrese.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
have
here,
setting
aside
the
issue
of
liberty
for
the
moment,
and
i
don't
understand
frankly
the
solicitor
general's
position
it
can
be
a
"now
you
see
it,
now
you
don't.
"
liberty.
it's
liberty,
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i'll
try.
but
i
think,
if
i
could
pursue
your
question
for
a
moment
as
to,
sort
of,
how
does
one
deal
with
this.
i
mean,
in
a
sense
there
are
50
laboratories
out
there.
the
famous
state
laboratories
of
justice
brandeis,
although
i
guess
it
wasn't
in
the
brandeis
brief,
but
he
talked
about
them.
these
laboratories,
however,
are
now
operating
largely
with
the
lights
out.
they're
operating
with
the
lights
out
because
it's
not
just
new
york.
what
i've
described
is
as
far
as
i've
been
able
to
determine
through
research
of
the
law
of
at
least
35
or
maybe
40
states...
and
i
know
maybe
i
shouldn't
admit
that
because
that
means
that
an
equal
protection
ruling
would
require
lots
of
states
to
reexamine
where
the
lines
should
be
drawn...
but
in
all
of
these
states
what
they
do,
and
it's
a
logic
that
collapses
on
itself,
is
they
combine
two
understandable
principles.
one
principle
is
you
can
medicate
someone
to
make
them
comfortable,
to
reduce
their
pain
even
when
you
are
pretty
sure...
or
even
when
you
know,
as
long
as
that's
not
your
real
intent,
that
it
will
hasten
their
death.
the
other
principle
is
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
say,
no,
don't
give
me
that
feeding
tube.
once
i've
got
it,
it
may
be
hard
to
take
it
out,
and
anyway,
leave
me
alone.
you
combine
these
two
and
the
logic
so
remarkably
collapses
in
the
case
of
terminal
sedation,
which
is
overwhelmingly
documented
everywhere
in
the
country,
it's
not
some
sneaky
practice,
although
it's
called
slow
euthanasia
in
this
latest
article,
that
what
you
wonder
is
where
did
this
all
this
come
from?
did
a--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--oh,
much
more,
yes,
justice
scalia.
it's
described
in
the
ama's
brief
and
the
geriatrics
brief.
what
i
mean
is,
after
having
discovered
that
opioids
are
not
going
to
work
to
get
rid
of
the
person's
agony,
physical
and...
physical
pain
and
deterioration
and
dyspnea
and
other
symptoms,
after
you
learn
that,
then
you
have
the
option
of
using
barbiturates
or
benzodiazepines
to
put
the
person
into
a
comatose
state.
and
you
can
do
that
hopefully
with
their
consent.
but
sadly
there
are
almost
no
safeguards
on
the
existing
legal
practice
to
assure
that
consent
is
given.
you
sedate
them
either
before
taking
them
off
a
respirator
because
we
are
told
that
asphyxiation
is
one
of
the
most
terrifying
and
excruciating
deaths,
or
you
keep
them
sedated
as
they
starve
and
dehydrate
and
their
families
see
them
disintegrate.
because
that's
all
that's
available
to
them.
it
is
the
kafkaesque
but
entirely
logical
result
of
the
principles
that
the
states
haven't
really
adopted
but
have
fallen
into.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
thought
it
had
a
lot
of
punch
to
begin
with.
but
i
guess
the
problem
is,
you
know,
most
of
us...
these
legislatures
are
operating
in
the
dark
and
we
hope
that
they
will
take
into
account
everyone's
interests
as
they
work.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
not
at
all.
i
think
they
have...
the
lights
are
bright
here.
when
i
say
the
dark,
i
mean
this:
doctors,
like
dr.
quill,
who,
when
he
explained
what
he
was
doing
in
the
case
of
someone
who
thought
it
would
be
dehumanizing
to
be
terminally
sedated,
so
he
publicly
explained
in
an
article
called
diane,
that
he
was
actually
going
to
leave
her
with
some
lethal
medications,
he
was
investigated
by
the
grand
jury.
when
doctors
do
a
lot
of
what
they
do
in
upping
the
level
of
the
morphine
and
actually
using
more
benzodiazepine
than
is
needed
to
make
sure
the
person
is
comfortable
but
to
make
sure
the
person
dies
sooner,
they're
not
going
to
talk
to
others
about
it
because
they
might
be
prosecuted
because
of
the
lines
that
are
drawn.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
already
have
it
unfortunately.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
seems
to
me,
justice
o'connor...
oustice
ginsburg,
that
the
methodology
of
equal
protection...
sorry...
that
the
methodology
of
equal
protection
does
mean
that
any
line
would
be
subject
to
meaningful
scrutiny.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
defensability
of
a
line
of
the
kind
we
have
here
would
never
reach
this
court
because
no
legislature
would
actually
draw
a
line
that
says
you
can
sedate
somebody
to
death
as
long
as
you
meet
the
criteria
of
double
effect,
but
you
can't
do
much
of
what
is
now--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
but
that's
the
residual
of
what's
happening
in
these
states--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
but
that's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think,
if
one
were
a
legislator,
one
might
look
at
that
report
and
say,
you
know,
there
is
no
better
line,
we're
going
to
stick
with
it.
and
if,
after
a
careful
look,
the
legislature
came
up
with
a
line
that
looks
very
much
like
the
existing
one,
the
issue
that
would
face
this
court,
either
as
a
matter
of
liberty
or
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection,
would
be
a
bit
different.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
by
the
tone
of
your
question,
i
guess
i'm
supposed
to
say
i
thought
it
was
a
crazy
idea,
but
i
didn't.
i
didn't.
i
think
it's
very
much
like...
what
does
this
court
do
when
it
says
something
is
a
suspect
classification,
as
in
croson?
it
says
if
there
were
different
findings
and
if
the
legislature
or
other
governing
body
really
went
through
the
process
with
care
of
doing
it
it
might
pass
muster.
now,
being
constitutionally
dubious--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
it
looks
different,
i
grant
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
meaning
really
of...
i
think,
of
deciding
that
something
is
either
constitutionally
too
dubious
to
pass
muster
given
the
haphazard
way
in
which
it
came
about,
or
that
it's
suspect,
is
that
the
very
same
thing
might
be
upheld
otherwise.
in
egglehoff--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
thought
you
joined
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
croson.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that
it
does
make...
i
think
that,
when
one
concludes...
in
an
area
as
profoundly
difficult
as
this,
when
one
concludes
that
something
is
constitutionally
doubtful,
and
when
it
came
about
by
kind
of
inadvertence,
that
is,
various
things
being
subtracted
from
an
existing
piece
of
legislation,
it's
a
little
bit
like
a
law
that
looks
suspect
and
that
doesn't
have
behind
it
the
kinds
of
findings
by
the
government
that
could
satisfy--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
submit
that
in
croson
you
held
such
a
thing.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
here.
that
it
should
be
in...
that
it's
invalid...
in
croson
you
said
it
was
invalid
because
it
was
a
suspect
classification
and
the
governing
body
responsible
for
it
hadn't
actually
provided
the
kind
of
defense
justification
assurance,
that
they
did
it
thoughtfully
and
not
kind
of
out
of
some
knee
jerk--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
and
i
think
that
it
may
be
that
in
this
area
one
could
specify
some
criteria
that
would
have
to
be
met--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
the
liberty
interest
in
this
case
is
the
liberty,
when
facing
imminent
and
inevitable
death,
not
to
be
forced
by
the
government
to
endure
a
degree
of
pain
and
suffering
that
one
can
relieve
only
by
being
completely
unconscious.
not
to
be
forced
into
that
choice,
that
the
liberty
is
the
freedom,
at
this
threshold
at
the
end
of
life,
not
to
be
a
creature
of
the
state
but
to
have
some
voice
in
the
question
of
how
much
pain
one
is
really
going
through.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
court's
jurisprudence
has
identified,
i
think
for
good
reason,
that
life,
though
it
feels
continuous
to
many
of
us,
has
certain
critical
thresholds:
birth,
marriage,
child-bearing.
i
think
death
is
one
of
those
thresholds.
that
is,
it
is
the
last
chapter
of
one's
life
after
all.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
say,
i
have
a
right
to
make
any--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
substantive
due
process.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
casey
said
as
much.
and
unless
casey...
unless
casey
is
to
be
isolated--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
is
prior
to
casey,
which
did
emphasize--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
actually,
justice
breyer,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
the
confluence
of
several
things.
i
mean,
the
general
interest
in--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--thanks.
i'll
do
it
briefly.
the
general
interest
in
avoiding
suffering
is
a
bit
too
nebulous
for
me.
i
think
when
it's
combined
with
shaping
your
life
and
with
the
ultimate
avoidance
of
being
subjected
to
the
state's
control,
then
it's
a
special
liberty.
