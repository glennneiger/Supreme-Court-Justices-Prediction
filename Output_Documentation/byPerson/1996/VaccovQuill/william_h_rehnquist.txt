95-1858,
dennis
c.
vacco,
attorney
general
of
new
york,
versus
timothy
e.
quill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
a
more
accurate
way
of
putting
your
point
of
view,
if
i
understand,
would
be
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
offended
by
treating
those
two
differently,
not
that
it's
not
implicated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
that
really
a
correct
use
of
the
word
sedation?
it
seems
to
me
you're
talking
about
analgesics,
painkillers,
whereas
sedation
is
just
to
kind
of
make
you
feel
better,
not
mind
things
so
much,
isn't
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
my
only
question
is
whether
it's
properly
called
sedation
or
not,
or
perhaps
something
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
odd
that
your
bodily
integrity
is
violated
by
sticking
a
needle
in
your
arm
but
not
by
sticking
a
spoon
in
your
mouth.
i
mean,
how
would
you
force-feed
these
people
in
a
way
not
to
violate
their
bodily
integrity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
vacco.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
dellinger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
the
strong
historical
distinction
which
you
mentioned,
aren't
you
suggesting
that
if
you
did
need
heightened
scrutiny,
that
would
help
the
thing
pass
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
dellinger.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
the
basis
of
the
second
circuit's
ruling,
was
it,
that
mark
chapman
could
be
force-fed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
didn't
talk
about
that
particular
provision,
they
said
you
can't
distinguish
between...
as
i
understand
their
opinion,
you
can't
distinguish
between
a
removal
at
the
patient's
instance
of
life
support
mechanisms
and
asking
for
a
lethal
dose?
because
i
didn't
think
it
had
anything
to
do
with
mark
chapman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
tribe,
if
we
go
into
this
sort
of
intricate
analysis
of
state
law
in
order...
in
accepting...
we
won't
be
deciding
any
case
except
new
york's
here.
we
would
have
to
make
the
same
analysis
for
49
other
states.
if
we
do
the
sort
of
intricate
analysis
that
you
talk
about,
where
we
talk
about
someone
being
force-fed
in
a
prison--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
on
earth
would
it
be
any
different
unless
you
would
buy
justice...
judge
calabrese's
idea?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
traditional
equal
protection
jurisprudence
though,
but
this
idea
of
can
i
send
it
back
for
a
second
look,
do
you
really
want
to
do
this?
i
think
that's
quite
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
we
held
such
a
thing
in
croson.
croson,
we
held
the
statute
was
invalid.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
wasn't...
the
test
wasn't
thoughtfully,
it
had
to
meet
certain
criteria.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
three
cases.
the
first
of
them
is
no.
95-1858,
vacco
against
quill.
in
new
york,
as
in
most
states,
it
is
a
crime
to
assist
a
suicide
but
patients
are
allowed
to
refuse
unwanted
medical
treatment
even
if
that
treatment
is
necessary
to
save
their
lives.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
this
distinction
is
so
irrational
that
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
respondents
here
are
new
york
doctors
and
they
argue
that
refusing
life-sustaining
medical
treatment
is
really
the
same
thing
as
physician-assisted
suicide
and
so
it
does
violate
equal
protection
clause
to
permit
one
but
not
the
other.
the
district
court
rejected
this
argument
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
agreed
with
it.
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
states
must
treat
like
cases
alike
but
they
treat
unlike
cases
accordingly.
that
is
the
proposition
which
we
have
followed
for
a
long
time
and
follow
here
and
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
respondents,
as
i
have
said,
contented
some
terminally
ill
people,
those
who
are
on
life
support
treatments
system,
that
are
treated
differently
from
those
who
are
not
because
the
former
may
hasten
death
by
ending
treatment
but
the
later
may
not
hasten
death
through
a
physician
assisted
suicide.
this
argument
assumes
though
that
ending
life-saving
treatment
is
the
same
thing
as
assisted
suicide
and
we
reject
this
assumption.
the
distinction
between
assisting
suicide
and
ending
life-sustaining
treatment
is
widely
recognized
and
endorsed
in
the
medical
profession
and
in
our
legal
tradition.
in
our
opinion,
we
focused
primarily
on
two
important
differences
between
the
two
practices.
first,
a
patient
who
commits
physician-assisted
suicide
is
killed
by
the
lethal
drug
provided
by
the
doctor
but
when
a
patient
refuses
life-sustaining
medical
treatment,
he
dies
from
his
underlying
disease
or
condition.
second,
a
physician
who
honors
a
patient’s
request
to
end
unwanted
treatment
does
not
necessarily
intend
that
the
patient
dies.
he
may
only
intend
to
respect
his
patient’s
wishes
and
to
seek
doing
futile
or
degrading
things
to
the
patient.
on
the
other
hand,
a
doctor
who
assists
a
suicide
must
necessarily
intend
primarily
that
the
patient
be
made
dead.
the
law
has
long
distinguished
between
actions
taken
because
of
a
give
result
from
actions
taken
in
spite
of
their
intended
but
unforeseen
consequences.
it
is
therefore,
not
surprising
that
many
courts
including
this
court
in
our
recent
cruzan
opinion,
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
legislators
have
drawn
a
clear
line
between
assisting
suicide
and
ending
unwanted
treatment.
we
therefore
reject
respondent’s
claim
that
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
irrational
or
arbitrary.
logic
and
contemporary
practice
supports
new
york’s
judgment
that
the
two
acts
are
different
and
the
constitution
permits
new
york
to
treat
them
differently.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
joined
in
part;
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
