justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
a
person
with
terminal
kidney
disease
and
says
i'm
not
going
on
dialysis.
i
know
what
the
result
will
be,
i'm
not
doing
it.
new
york
can
force
that
treatment;
is
that
right?
that's
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
what's
given
is
some
form
of
sedation
and
the
person
has
asked
to
be
relieved
of
life
support
systems
and
so
the
sure
consequence
of
sedation
will
be
an
earlier
death?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
to
alleviate
pain
but
with
the
certain
knowledge
that
it
will
hasten
the
death?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
we
put
this
in
the
framework
of
the
position,
general
dellinger,
that
you
have
taken
here,
which
is
that
there
is
some
recognizable
liberty
interest,
and
how
does
that
affect
the
analysis
under
an
equal
protection
approach?
does
it
mean
that
rational
basis
just
won't
suffice,
we
have
something
else
that
we
have
to
apply
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
more
than
a
rational
basis,
i
think
that's
the
term.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
test
is
it
that
you
say
this
court
should
apply
in
the
equal
protection
context?
