justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
vacco,
instead
of
going
down
the
list
of
six,
if
we
could
focus
on
what
was
of
concern
to
the
second
circuit
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
right
to
withdraw
treatment
from
age
16
to
age
96.
the
distinction
that
the
second
circuit
fastened
on
was
the
terminally
ill
person
who
says
no
more
life
supports,
i
want
to
die,
and
the
person
who
wants
a
pill
that
will
achieve
the
same
end.
so
let's
narrow
it
to
what
that
court
was
dealing
with
and
tell
us
why
that
court
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
if
we
had
just
those
two
neat
categories,
this
might
be
an
easier
case;
that
is,
of
pulling
the
plug,
that's
the
patient's
choice,
anything
affirmative.
but
we're
told
in
this
wealth
of
briefs
that
there
are
things
in
between
that
go
on,
like
sedation
for
pain
that
can
be
controlled.
and
that
is
not
rationally
distinguished
from
the
pill
that
the
physician...
increasing,
say,
the
morphine
is
not
rationally
distinguishable
from
giving
a
person
a
pill.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
vacco,
may
i
ask
you,
then,
to
train
your
attention
on
what
has
been
described
as
the
worst
case,
it's
been
called
the
barbiturate
coma
or
whatever,
that
is
not
in
the
last
hour
or
hours,
what
you've
just
been
addressing,
but
you
render
a
person
unconscious,
you
withdraw
nutrition,
and
water,
and
it
goes
on
for
days
and
days
and
the
person
finally
shrivels
up
and
dies,
and
that
that,
we're
told,
is
permissible
and
goes
on
in
hospitals
in
new
york?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
i'm
asking
you
is,
you
say
you've
distinguished
the
drugs
at
the
last
hour
or
hours
of
life.
but
we're
told
that
this
treatment,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
that
inevitably
will
lead
to
death,
will
do
so
in
a
matter
of
days,
not
hours.
and
that
that
goes
on.
and
how
is
that
rationally
distinguishable
from
a
pill
that
will
work--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
vacco,
you
don't
dispute
that
a
legislature
in
new
york
or
elsewhere
could
come
to
the
rational
judgment
that
a
legislature
in
australia
or
in
oregon
or...
i
don't
know
how
it
came
about
in
the
netherlands,
but
a
rational
decision
could
be
made
the
other
way,
couldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
vacco,
if
you
could
be
more
precise
about
who
is
the
we
that
you
are
talking
about.
you
have
asserted
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
use
its
authority
to
force-feed
a
person
who
doesn't
want
to
be
fed.
does
that
go
for...
well,
first,
is
that
a
legislative
decision,
did
the
courts
make
that
decision,
did
the
police
make
the
decision?
and
what
people
are
affected
by
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
that
decision
and
who
did
it
affect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
risks
on
the
other
side,
that
even
the
american
medical
association
recognizes;
that
is,
this
gray
area
in
between
makes
doctors
fearful
of
putting
people
out
of
pain
because
they
don't
know
whether
that's
going
to
constitute
physician-assisted
suicide
or
accepted
relief
of
pain?
isn't
that
a
real
risk?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dillinger,
if
you
could
deal
with
the
argument
that's
been
made
about
winks
and
nods,
that
all
of
this
is
really
a
great
sham
because
physician-assisted
suicide
goes
on
for
anybody
who
is
sophisticated
enough
to
want
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
tribe,
the
whole
solution
now
you've
given
us,
i
think,
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
new
york
could
say
and
be
perfectly
compatible
with
equal
protection,
as
you've
just
described
it,
person
who
is
terminally
ill,
you've
got
to
make
the
choice
now
before
we
give
you
the
life
support,
you
have
a
right
to
refuse
it,
but
once
you've
accepted
it,
you
have
no
right
to
have
it
taken
out.
so
understand
that,
and
new
york
does
that,
then
these...
this
equal
protection
problem
disappears;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
one
of
the
problems,
isn't
it?
one
of
the
problems
of
defining--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
that's
a
discrete
situation.
this
is
the
question
i'd
like
to
ask
you:
you
have
said,
or
at
least
many
of
your
amici
have
said,
protocols
and
criteria
are
the
watchword,
because
you
have
to
be
very
careful.
this
is
a
dangerous
authority
that
you
would
be
giving
to
the
medical
profession.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
moment
this
court
says,
liberty
interest
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
terminally
ill,
we
don't
define
what
that
is,
there
is
no
law.
and
by
your
very
argument
and
very
excellent
brief,
one
can
see
a
lawyer
criticizing
any
line
that
the
legislature
would
come
up
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is
what...
how
many
legislatures
have.
i
mean,
you're
not
singling
out
new
york
as
being
different
from
new
jersey
or
anyplace
else
in
that
regard,
are
you?
