justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
general
vacco,
kind
of
a
basic
question?
many
of
the
arguments
are
that
there
are
the
same
risks
involved
in
pulling
the
plug
and
physician-assisted
suicide,
both
in
terms
of
making
sure
what
the
patient
wants
and
making
sure
there
are
no
abuses.
in
your
view,
could
the
new
york
legislature
have
decided
in
the
cases
of
terminating
life
support
equipment,
to
totally
forbid
it
for
the
same
reasons
that
they
totally
forbid
the
assisted
suicide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
curious
to
know
what
your
answer
is
to
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
before
your
time
expires,
would
you
tell
us
what
you
think
the
liberty
interest
is.
