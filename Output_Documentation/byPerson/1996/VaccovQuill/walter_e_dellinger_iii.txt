mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
that
is
raised
with
more
saliency
in
new
york
is
that
even
if
the
state
may,
as
a
general
matter,
legitimately
prohibit
the
granting
of
lethal
medication,
the
fact
that
these
state
permit
practices
that
are
in
the
respondents'
view
medically,
ethically,
and
morally
indistinguishable
from
lethal
medication
requires
that
these
states
also
do
that.
we
do
not
agree
that
the
states'
interest
in
prohibiting
lethal
medication
is
lessened
by
the
fact
that
the
state
permits
competent
terminally
ill
adults
to
refuse
unwanted
medical
treatment.
there
is
an
important
common
sense
distinction
between
withdrawing
artificial
support
so
that
a
disease
will
progress
to
its
inevitable
end
and
providing
chemicals
to
be
used
to
kill
someone.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
justice
kennedy.
first
of
all,
the
interest
in
refusing...
the
strength
of
the
interest
in
refusing
the
state's
forcible
imposition
of
medical
treatment
is
so
historically
great.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
it
does,
even
in
an
equal
protection
context,
ask
for
something
more
than
a
merely
plausible
explanation.
i
think
here
the
states
have--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--more
than
a
rational
basis,
yes,
and
by
that
i
meant...
yes,
more
than
a
rational
basis,
and
by
that
i
meant
that
sometimes
the
rational
basis
test
seems
to
be
a
little
tougher
than
others.
i
meant
merely
to
exclude--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--in
the
equal
protection
context,
i
think
at
most
this
court
should
apply
something
on
the
order
of
an
intermediate
scrutiny.
but
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
the
state...
that
would
assume,
justice
o'connor,
i
wanted
to
answer
your
question,
but
that
assumes
that
the
state
has
even
drawn
a
classification
here.
when,
in
fact,
what
the
state
has
done
is
to
allow
to
every
citizen
of
new
york
a
number
of
steps
that
the
state
and
the
medical
profession
have
taken
to
alleviate
pain
and
suffering
in
the
end.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
kennedy,
the
historic
distinction
between
killing
someone
and
letting
them
die
is
so
powerful
that
we
believe
that
it
fully
suffices
here.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
agree.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes...
yes,
of
course.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
true.
i
think
that,
and
the
briefs
of
the
medical
professions
will
indicate
that
a
legislature
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
risk
of
those
who
would
seek
lethal
medication,
being
depressed
or
undertreated
from
pain,
are
not
as
competent--
they're
greater
than
they
are
with
respect
to
someone
who
is
declining
unwanted
medical
treatment--
--yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
breyer,
i
believe
that
that
would
strengthen
a
state's
concern
about
introducing
lethal
medication
into
such
a
medical
system,
that
is,
that
they...
if
the
need
of
the
medical
system
is
to
further
the
process
that
the
medical
associations
contend
is
ongoing
of
enhancing
palliative
care,
enhancing--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
state
in
our
view
is
entitled
to
think
that
introducing
lethal
medication
into
a
system
is...
puts
an
even
greater
risk
on
those
who
are...
particularly
those
who
are
poor
and
those
who
are
handicapped,
an
even
greater
risk
if
that
system
is
decreasing
the
amount
of
palliatives.
if
a
person
supposedly
is
making
a
voluntary
choice
to
choose
lethal
medication
but
they're
in
a
system,
in
an
institution
in
which
their
pain
is
not
being
controlled,
and
perhaps
the
insurance
adjuster
is
saying
we're
not...
this
is
expensive,
this
team
of
professionals
is
too
expensive,
but
you
do
have
an
alternative
to
your
suffering.
remember,
that
to
some
uncertain
extent,
if
you
recognize
a
constitutionally
based
right
to
have
lethal
medication
in
the
system,
i
do
not
know
to
what
extent
physicians
would
be
required
to
present
it
as
a
treatment
option,
i
mean
that
is
the
general
requirement.
we
don't
know
that,
we
don't
know
to
what
extent
insurance
companies
as
they
have
indicated
in
oregon
would
quickly
say
of
course
we
will
pay
for
this
treatment
while
they
are
not
paying
for
a
hospitalization
for
palliative
treatment.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
judge
ginsburg,
i
simply...
we
looked
and
we
don't
know
what
the
evidentiary
basis
is
for
that.
that
is,
that
the
counsel
for
the
respondents
in
new
york
says
that
in
new
york
there
is
this
process
called
terminal...
the
state
permits
terminal
sedation.
we
found
nothing
in
new
york's
statutory
law,
nothing
in
the
regulations.
your
question
goes
also
to
the
practice.
i
think
there
may
be
some
confusion.
we
agree
that
state
law
may,
without
crossing
this
important
line,
not
only
allow
withdrawal
of
medical
treatment
but
also
allow
physicians
to
prescribe
medication
in
sufficient
doses
to
relieve
pain
even
when
the
necessary
dose
will
hasten
death,
so
long
as
the
physician's
intent
is
to
relieve
pain
and
not
cause
death.
we
do
not
know
any
basis
for
the
conclusion
that
pain
medication's
being
deliberately
offered
in
excess
of
what
is
necessary
to
relieve
pain
in
order
to
cause
death.
