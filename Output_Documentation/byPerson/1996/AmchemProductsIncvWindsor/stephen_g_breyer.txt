justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
was
comparable?
suppose
that
in
fact
you
did
have...
the
water
mains
overflowed
through
negligence,
and
you
had
500,000
people
who
over
the
course
of
a
week
due
to
new
york
city's
negligence
slipped
and
fell.
i
guess
you
would
say
there
are
500,000
people
in
that
category.
they
were
exposed
to
the
ice.
they
fell,
and
we
want
to
have
a
class
action.
we'll
settle
the
cases.
would
there
be
a
problem
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they've
all
fallen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
people
are
going
to...
3
years
from
now
are
going
to
develop
whip
lashes,
and
others
won't--
[laughter]
--and
various
things
will
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
the
reality
is
that
there
is,
in
a
way,
a
kind
of
limited
fund
unless
you
assume
that
the
defendants
in
these
cases
are
simply
standing
in
court
saying,
we'll
pay
anything
they
want.
the
sky
is
the
limit.
if
the
sky
is
not
the
limit,
then
there
really
is
a
conflict
among
these
subclasses,
and
the
only
way
it
seems
to
get
around
that
conflict
is
to
say,
well,
there
isn't
one
any
more,
because
here
they
all
are,
and
they
like
what
they're
getting.
and
isn't
that
the
vise
that
the
third
circuit
was
getting
at,
that
your
fairness
inquiry
after
the
fact
of
settlement
is
displacing
all
of
the
criteria
that
normally
have
to
be
applied
in
order
to
satisfy
just
judicial
standards
before
you
even
get
to
looking
at
fairness?
isn't
that
what
the
third
circuit
was
concerned--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
let
me
suggest
one
change
in
judge
becker's
opinion
that
i
think
would
leave
us
right
where
we
are,
but
perhaps
i'm
wrong.
what
if
judge
becker
had
said,
look,
the
vise
here
is
that
the
settlement
is
being
used
as
a
sufficient
basis
in
and
of
itself
to
answer
these
various
preceding
inquiries,
to
satisfy
these
various
preceding
conditions
for
class
certification.
if
he
had
put
in
that
word
sufficiency,
wouldn't
everything
else
in
the
third
circuit's
opinion
basically
be
just
as
appropriate,
or
inappropriate,
as
the
case
may
be,
as
it
is
the
way
the
third
circuit
actually
phrased
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
would
in
fact
have
a
very
different
inquiry,
as
you
yourself
argue,
if
there
were
not
already
a
settlement
on
the
table
and,
in
fact,
there
is
a
good
argument,
as
justice
ginsburg
just
suggested,
for
coming
out
quite
differently
depending
on
whether
you
were
looking
at
it
before
the
settlement
and
after
the
settlement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
question
is
one
of
degree,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
suggestion
in
her
question
and
the
suggestion
in
mine
is
that
the
degree
is
so
great
that
the
only
way
to
make
sense,
i
think,
of
the
certification
which
the
district
court
made
was
by
saying,
the
district
court
was
treating
the
settlement
as
sufficient
as
opposed
merely
to
one
source
of
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
court
has
to
approve
the
settlement
if
it's
a
justiciable
controversy.
i
mean,
you're...
that's
circular.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
does
it...
i
mean,
we
used
to
have
in
boston
very
complicated
settlements
in
civil
rights
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
running...
the
whole
fire-fighters,
i
mean,
all
kinds
of
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--enormously
complicated
provisions,
entered
through
settlement
of
thousands
of
people,
and
those
decrees
would
be
there.
we
would
normally
administer
the
settlement,
and
they
appealed,
frequently.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
way
this
differs
from
that,
you're
saying,
is
that
the
parties
here
who
are
members
of
the
class
don't
really
have
a
fight
with
the
defendants?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
but
i
mean,
is...
i
know
the
testimony.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
distinction,
or
are
there
other
distinctions?
in
other
words,
unlike
others,
perhaps,
on...
i'm
not
concerned
particularly
with
the
fact
that
it's
complicated,
that
it
differs
from
state
tort
law,
because
i've
just
seen
so
many
consent
decrees
where
that
is
so
growing
out
of
settlements,
particularly
in
the
civil
rights
area,
so
if
that
isn't
the
problem,
the
complexity,
or
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
state
laws
rights
they're
giving
up,
what
exactly
is
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
one
such
change?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that
they
are
giving
up...
each
member
of
the
class
is
giving
up
a
legal
right
to
sue
that
he
might
have
under
the
laws
of
many
different
states.
that's
so
in
any
settlement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
different
about
this
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
thought
they
were
bringing
metro-north
kinds
of
actions.
a
metro-north
kind
of
action,
if
it
exists--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
seen
many
such
actions
in
civil
rights
cases
again
where
a
person
says,
i
will
give
up
and
compromise
my
present
claim
for
$50,000
and,
in
addition,
i
promise
never
to
bring
another
action
growing
out
of
the
same
incident.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
fairly
common.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you,
but
maybe
i'll...
the...
what's
obviously...
what's
actually
motivating
my
question
partly
is
the
analogy
to
what
i've
seen
is
a
lot
of
settled
cases
in
the
civil
rights
area
where
it
seems
to
me
the
power
to
accept
settlement
is
fairly
broad,
and
to
extinguish
state
law
claims,
and
i
grant
you
you're
right
that
this
is
in
the
far...
pushing
that.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
the
reason
the
district
judge
says
that
they've
gotten
into
this
thing
is
that
they're
trying
to
settle
millions
of
claims,
and
the
reason
that
they're
trying
to
do
that,
he
says
the
victims
are
not
receiving
speedy
and
reasonably
inexpensive
resolution
of
their
claims.
these
are
millions
of
people
who
actually
do
have
cancer.
now,
i
take
it
that
this
is
an
effort
to
use
rule
23
in
order
to
get
that
problem
solved.
now,
that's
what's
moving
me
in
part,
and
that's
why
i'm
interested
in
whether
there
isn't
the
power
here
to
bring
about
what
the
district
court
says
he's
aiming
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
does
that
work,
subclasses?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about...
are
you
then...
is
the
implication
of
what
you're
saying
that
imagine
a
big
company,
or
several
of
them,
that
have
a
history
of
employment
discrimination,
and
they
work
out
a
settlement
that
is
going
to
cover
millions
of
people
into
the
future,
or
toxic
torts
of
all
kinds...
you
know,
there
are
thousands
of
them,
and
now
it
would
be
impermissible
to
put
anybody
in
the
settlement
class,
anybody...
anybody
who
might
work
for
this
company
in
the
future,
unless
in
the
absence
of
that
settlement
his
position
is
similar
enough
to
the
others
in
the
class
that
he'd
be
in
it
anyway.
that
proposition
of
law
seems
to
have,
to
me,
a
lot
of
implications
as
to
all
kinds
of
decrees
all
over
the
place
in
ways
that
would
inhibit
settlements
that
might
be
highly
desirable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
but
that
apple
would
be
out
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
that
apple
would
be
out
of
the
class,
and
that
apple
being
out
of
the
class
would
mean
that
the
company
wouldn't
know
what
was
going
to
happen,
and
therefore,
who
knows?
or,
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
enforcing
the
decree,
the
company
claims,
oh,
that's
one
of
the
apples,
or
the
apple
says
it's
the
apple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see...
do
you
see
the
problem?
i
mean,
that...
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
rule
that
requires
that
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think
there
would
be
any
difference
if
we
were
to
hold
hypothetically
that
there
had
to
be
four
lawyers,
one
for
the
people
who
brought
suit
before,
one
for
the
people
who
have
the
disease
already,
one
for
the
people
who
have
the
thickening,
and
one
for
the
people
who
have
nothing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
that
lead
to
a
practical
difference
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
if
this
court
were
to
say
the
thing
that
was
wrong
with
this
is
that
there
wasn't
those
four
separate
lawyers,
and
it
went
back,
it
would
reach
the
same
result,
in
your
view?
