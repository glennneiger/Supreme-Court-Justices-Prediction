chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-270,
amchem
products,
inc.
v.
george
windsor.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
limitations
that
are
imposed
by
the
rules
enabling
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
that
basically
the
rules
have
to
be
rules
of
procedure
in
a
contemplated
lawsuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
can
understand
what
you're
saying,
mr.
shapiro,
with
respect
to
one
plaintiff
and
one
defendant
settling
contrary
to
some
principle
of
state
law,
but
here
i
get
the
impression
it's
the
tail
wagging
the
dog,
almost.
none
of
these
individuals
have
much
to
say
about
what...
the
settlements
made.
it's
the
attorneys,
and
their
incentives
may
be
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
afl-cio...
was
it
a
party
to
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
benevolent
protective
order
of
elks
had
participated--
[laughter]
--because
they
were
both
elks?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
that
body
of
cases
been
here?
has
it
been
in
our
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--go
ahead.
do
you
want
to
finish
your--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish,
then,
the
cases
that
mr.
shapiro
cites
which
we
read
about
in
the
papers,
and
probably
some
are
participating,
where
it
is
announced
that
the
justice
department
is
bringing
an
action
and
that
x
pleads
nolo
contendere,
and
that
a
consent
decree
has
been
entered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
plaintiffs
in
the
class
action
are
saying
if
you
disagree
we'll
take
you
to
court
just
as
much,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
this
discussion
has
been
certainly
quite
wide-ranging,
and
i
certainly
have
contributed.
if
you
look
at
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
it's
whether
the
district
court
has
to
ignore
the
existence
of
the
settlement
in
determining
whether
class
certification
is
appropriate
under
rule
23.
now,
that's
really
quite
a
different
question
than
the
ones
we've
been
arguing...
hearing
and
discussing,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
judge
weiner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
is
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--can
a
district
court
certify
a
case
that
clearly
could
not
be
certified
for
litigation
for--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
your
time
has
expired--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
