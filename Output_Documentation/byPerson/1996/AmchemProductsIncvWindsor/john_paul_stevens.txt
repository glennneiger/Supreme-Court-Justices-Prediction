justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
many
cases,
and
it's
sometimes
a
question
of
the
degree
of
the
difference
between
substance
and
procedure,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
by
using
the
term
fairness
the
district
court
here
imported
and
made
choices
between
substantive
chances
of
recovery,
of
liability,
of
measure
of
damages,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
not
the
intent
of
the
rule,
and
that
it
exceeds
the
authority
of
the
courts
under
the
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
fairness
becomes...
fairness,
which
is
an
infinitely
acceptable
concept,
is
the
basis
for
legislation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
parties
are
then
conferring
a
new
regime,
a
new
substantive
regime
of
law
upon
the
court
that
the
court
adopts.
it's
like
asking
the
court
to
be
an
arbitrator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
would
have
been
suits
on
behalf
of
some
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
a
case
or
controversy
as
to
some
people,
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
john
paul
stevens
might
have
been
a
case?
you
don't
think
any
of
these
plaintiffs
would
be
litigating--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
there
weren't
this
settlement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
probably
hundreds
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
talking
about
the
fringes
of
the
class.
maybe
the
class
is
too
big.
i'm
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you're
saying
there's
no
case
or
controversy
here,
not
even
as
to
those
who
have
cancer
and
wanted
to
sue
for
millions
of
dollars,
if
i
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
absence
of
a
case
or
controversy
as
to
some
members
of
the
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
what
you're
claiming--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
entirely
no
case
or
controversy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
saying
the
class
is
too
big,
yes.
how
do
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
mr.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
tribe,
may
i
just
ask
you,
do
you
agree
with
this
sentence
out
of
judge
becker's
opinion:
we
held
in
gm
trucks
that,
although
class
actions
may
be
certified
for
settlement
purposes
only,
rule
23(a)'s
requirements
must
be
satisfied
as
if
the
case
were
going
to
be
litigated.
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
that
mean
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
conceivable
that
there
are
class
actions
that
have
come
to
the
court
in
a
settlement
posture
which
the
trial
court
could
say,
well,
if
this
were
going
to
be
tried,
i
really
couldn't
prove
the
class
certification
but,
given
the
settlement,
i
think
i
will
approve
it?
is
that
ever
possible,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we've
got
district
court
findings
that
they
were.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think...
you
don't
agree
with
them,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
do
we
take
the
case
as
though
the
representation
was
adequate
or
inadequate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
quoting
from
a
third
circuit
case
there...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
give
you
a
little
different...
supposing
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding
that
really
there
ought
to
be
18
subclasses
because
there's
heterogeneity,
but
if
i
look
at
this
settlement
i
think
that
each
one
of
those
18
subclasses
got
the
best
deal
it
could
have
gotten
if
they
had
18
separate
representatives.
would
it
be
permissible
on
those
facts
to
certify
the
class?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
would
be
met
as
to
each
18
subclass,
clearly,
but
the
problem
is
you've
got
18
subclasses,
but
yet
you
look
through
it
all
and
you
say,
well,
i
think
each
of
those
18
subclasses
got
at
least
as
good
if
not
a
better
deal
in
the
total
settlement
as
if
they'd
had
18
subclasses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
finds
that
they
got
the
same
benefit
that
they
would
have
gotten
that
way...
because
the
main
difficulty
that
he
foresaw
was
there
wasn't
enough
money
to
go
around,
and
that's
what
creates
the
major
controversy,
but
here
he
found
there
was
enough
money
to
go
around.
