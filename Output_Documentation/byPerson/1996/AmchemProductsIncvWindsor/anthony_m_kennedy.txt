justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am...
counsel,
i
am
willing
to
accept
that
that
is
true,
that
it's
superior.
it
would
seem
to
me
also
a
superior
way
to
proceed
for
new
york
city
to
say,
you
know,
we
know
we're
going
to
have
500
slip-and-fall
claims.
why
give
all
the
money
to
the
attorneys?
we'll
just
have
a
class
action
for
everybody
that
might
have
a
slip-and-fall
claim,
and
we'll
adopt
a
workman's
comp
schedule
of
injuries,
so
much
for
an
arm,
so
much
for
a
leg,
so
much
for
a
broken
hip,
and
we'll
just
have
a
class
action.
that's
far
superior.
but
i
don't
see
the
substantive
source
of
law
that
the
court
can
and
ought
to
look
to
in
order
to
determine
what
is
fair,
and
on
page
14
of
your
brief
you
say,
the
questions
that
remain
in
the
case
were
common
to
class
members,
whether
it's
fair
and
reasonable
to
compromise
tort
claims
for
asbestos-related
injuries
with
high
transaction
costs,
et
cetera,
in
exchange
for
the
specific
compensation
system
established
by
the
settlement.
if
i
were
the
district
judge
i'd
say,
this
is
marvelously
superior,
but
that
is
a
substantive
determination
that
you
are
going
to
displace
existing
law
with
a
new,
different,
substantive
regime,
and
i
don't
think
the
rules
allow
you
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
slip-and-fall
is
much
more
well-established.
do
you--
[laughter]
could
new
york
city
do
what
i
supposed?
this
is
a
much
more
intelligent
way
to
proceed
than
having...
spending
a
lot
money
on
legal
fees,
from
many
policy
perspectives.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
seems
to
me
even
more
of
a
legislative
cast
to
what
the
court
does.
the
court
said,
i've
looked
at
what
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
have
said,
the
afl-cio,
is
it,
and
this
is
what
is
fair
and
good
and
reasonable.
that
is
not
a
standard
that
has
been
delegated
to
the
courts
by
the
legislature.
it
actually
exceeds
the
bounds
of
the
case
or
controversy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
those
factors
help
answer
the
question
put
by
justice
breyer
as
to
why
this
is
different
from
the
fire-fighters?
is
the
difference...
and
i'm
not
sure
of
how
to
best
articulate
it,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
is
the
difference
that
in
the
fire-fighters
case,
civil
rights
case,
there
was
an
imminent
litigable
dispute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
here
there
is
not,
or
does
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
sufficient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
requisite
premise
is
that
the
case
must
be
capable
of
being
litigated.
you
do
not
go
that
far.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
chief
justice...
we
talked
about
the
question
that
was
presented,
and--
