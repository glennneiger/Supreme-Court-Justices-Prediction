mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
here
today
to
contend
that
the
third
circuit
was
in
error
when
it
held
that
rule
23
must
be
applied
with
a
blind
eye
toward
the
settlement
reached
in
this
case.
in
colorful
language,
the
third
circuit
accused
the
district
court
and
the
proponents
of
the
settlement
of
crafting
a
legislative
solution
to
the
asbestos
crisis.
in
fact,
it
was
the
third
circuit
that
fashioned
a
new
restriction
on
class
actions
that
has
no
basis
in
the
text
of
rule
23.
the
court
declared
broadly
that
rule
23
must
be
applied
without
reference
to
settlement,
and
that
settlement
is
an
impermissible
consideration,
but
the
third
circuit
cited
nothing
in
rule
23
that
says
that
the
court
lacks
authority
to
consider
settlement,
and
even
some
of
the
respondents
now
concede
that
the
settlement
should
not
be
ignored.
we
are
not,
of
course,
asking
for
any
relaxation
of
the
protections
or
the
standards
of
rule
23.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
no
substantive
changes
should
be
made
in
the
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
your
honor,
this,
of
course,
was
a
lawsuit,
but
there
is
no
requirement
in
rule
23
that
the
lawsuit
has
to
be
determined
to
be
triable.
the
rule
uses
generic
language
about
issues
being
in
common,
about
claims,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
the
action
has
to
be
determined
to
be
triable
before
the
case
can
be
certified
for
settlement
and,
indeed,
we've
had
30
years
of
practice
now
in
the
various
courts
of
appeals
where
class
actions
settled...
cases
certified
for
settlement
have
been
accepted
by--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--these
people,
of
course,
have
the
opportunity
to
opt
out
of
the
class.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
we
believe
they
did.
the
court
found
that
they
had
been
given
notification
that
satisfied
due
process
standards
and,
indeed,
it
was
one
of
the
most
massive
notifications
in
history.
seven
hundred
thousand
people
received
personal
notifications
through
the
mail,
some
6
million
people
received
notifications
through
union
publications,
there
was
television
programming
that
included
this
warning,
there
was
targeted
newspaper
coverage--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
there
have
been
many
cases,
class
action
settlements,
where
injunctions
have
been
entered
after
the
case
was
settled
to
prevent
splintering
off,
challenges
to
the
class
action
settlement,
provided
that
due
process
is
satisfied
in
giving
notification.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
agent
orange
case
is
an
example
like
that,
from
the
second
circuit,
where
the
manufacturers
settled
with
a
nationwide
class
of
veterans
from
the
vietnam
war,
all
of
whom
had
been
exposed.
some
had
diseases,
some
did
not,
and
the
court
protected
that
settlement
with
injunctive
orders
that
prohibited
relitigation
of
the
issues
settled
in
the
class.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
it
entered
ancillary
injunctions
against
those
that
attempted
to
splinter
off
and
relitigate.
ever
since
this
court's
decision
in
supreme
tribe
of
ben
hur
v.
cobble
it's
been
clear
that
if
there's
a
class
action
settlement
that
satisfies
due
process
the
court--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
this,
your
honor,
was
what
the
witnesses
described
as
the
most
massive
notification
campaign
ever
undertaken
until
this
time,
and
it
specifically
identified
the
people
who
were
in
the
class...
occupational
exposure
to
asbestos...
and
it
was
carried
on
for
3
months.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
includes
everybody
who
has
occupational
exposure.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
the
court
found--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
district
court
found
that
substantially
everybody
who
has
had
occupational
exposure
knows
it,
because
since
1972
osha's
been
requiring--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
think
it's
virtually
everybody
who's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--there
are,
of
course,
exceptions,
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--those
persons
do
have
due
process,
because
the
rule
requires
the
best
notice
practicable.
those
persons
are
protected
by
adequate
representation--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
exceptional
case
shouldn't
determine
whether
the
notification
for
the
class
itself
meets
constitutional
standards.
there
are
protections
such
as
rule
60(b)
that
your
honor
referred
to
in
the
epstein
case.
if
there's
some
individual
who
has
a
truly
exceptional
situation,
explaining
we
didn't
really
know
that
we
had
been
exposed
to
asbestos
and
we
couldn't
be
expected
to
know
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--there
could
be
an
exception
for
such
a
person.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
is
a
superiority
requirement
which
supplies
the
good
reason.
judge
reed
made
elaborate
findings
of
fact
that
this
was
superior
to
relegating
people
to
a
tort
system
where
two-thirds
of
the
dollars
are
spent
on
lawyer's
fees
where
the
capricious
results,
many
years
of
delay,
afl-cio
endorsed
this
settlement--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
justice
kennedy,
this
body
of
litigation
is
unique
in
the
sense
that
this
is
the
most
mature
body
of
mass
tort
litigation
in
the
country.
there's
30
years
of
experience
here
in
settling
these
cases.
the
disease
categories
are
very
well-known,
and
one
can
assign
values
to
these
categories
with
a
great
deal
of
confidence.
many
other
cases
don't
fit
that
description,
and
so
the
court
would
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--there
would
be
real
difficulties
in
doing
that,
because
in
slip-and-fall
accidents
the
variety
of
injuries
and
the
variety
of
claims
for
harm
are
not
just
three
or
four,
as
there
are
in
this--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
i
think
if
you're
talking
about
people
who
haven't
had
their
exposures,
haven't
had
any
slip
and
fall--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--they've
all--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--if
there
was
an
attempt
to
settle
in
one
proceeding
all
the
past
injury
cases
and
you
could
really
find
typical
and
adequate
class
representatives
for
that
huge
array
of
injuries,
it's
not
inconceivable,
but
not
many
cases
really
are
manageable
in
the
sense
that
this
one
is.
this
one
is
truly
unique
because
of
the
maturity
of
the
litigation.
there
are
only
four
disease
categories
here,
and
people
know
with
a
great
deal
of
certainty
about
what
value
attaches
to
them.
we're
talking
about
people
who
have
been
injured
in
the
past
through
exposure
but
who
haven't
filed
suit,
or
people
who
are
actually
sick
at
the
moment.
we're
not
talking
about
injuries
that
will
occur
in
the
future.
now,
we
don't
generalize
and
say
that
this
settlement
regime
would
work
in
all
situations.
you
do
have
to
apply
the
rule
23
criteria.
you
don't
just
look
to
the
fairness
of
the
settlement,
or
some
abstract--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
the
critical
issue,
and
professor
tribe
has
caricatured
our
position
as
amounting
to
that,
but
it
certainly
is
not
our
submission.
we
don't
think
that
the
fairness
inquiry
wipes
out
the
other
inquiries
under
rule
23.
the
adequacy
inquiry
is
still
central.
the
typicality
inquiry
is
central.
the
superiority
inquiry
is
central.
but
we
say
that
these
standards
need
to
be
focused
on
the
negotiation
history
and
the
actual
results--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--as
well
as
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--of
the
parties.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
was
struck
by
the
comment
of
the
rules
committee
current
draft
of
the
change
in
rule
23
that
said
that
our
position
is
law
everywhere
in
the
united
states
except
in
the
third
circuit.
thirty-nine
percent
of
all
the
cases
that
are
certified
today
are
certified
for
settlement
purposes
only.
this
is
really
no
change.
this
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
completely
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
and
when
you
look
to
these
other
factors
and
you
consider
the
settlement,
it
makes
them
so
much
more
meaningful
and...
as
opposed
to
speculating
in
the
abstract,
as
this
court
said--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
don't
think
the
third
circuit
could
have
modified
the
opinion
that
way,
because
judge
reed
looked
at
a
host
of
other
things
in
addition
to
the
settlement.
he
didn't
look
just
to
the
settlement.
he
looked
to
the
alignment
of
the
representatives;
he
looked
at
their
incentives;
he
looked
at
the
negotiation
history
to
see
if
these
conflicts
were
reality
or
just
fiction,
and
in
that
sense
the
inquiry
is
really
a
much-improved
inquiry.
if
you
just
look
at
the
complaint,
you
can't
begin
to
tell
if
you're
going
to
get
adequate
representation,
or
if
you're
going
to
get
typicality,
if
you're
going
to
get
superiority.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
absolutely--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
think
that
would
be
a
mischaracterization
of
what
judge
reed
did,
because
he
looked
at
a
host
of
factors
pertaining
to
the
alignment
and
the
incentives
and
the
vigor
of
the
negotiation,
the
changes
that
were
made
in
this
deal,
whether
or
not
the
afl-cio
endorsed
it...
he
was
looking
to
an
entire
array
of
relevant
facts.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
there
are
conflicts
in
cases
that
have
been
certified
for
settlement
and
in
cases
that
are
certified
for
trial,
and
the
district
courts
have
to
use
the
tools
that
are
given
them
to
examine,
to
see
if
what
was
achieved
was
a
vigorous,
adversarial
attempt
to
maximize
the
amount
of
money
from--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
have
lots
of
indications
here,
factual
indications
that
that
isn't
true,
and
i
suggest
this
is
a
factual
question
where
deferential
review
is
appropriate.
recall
that
it
was
the
federal
judiciary,
judge
weiner,
the
mdl
panel,
the
federal
judicial
center
that
urged
these
global
negotiations
for
a
global
resolution.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
and
the--
[laughter]
the
lawyers
that
were--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--picked
to
do
this--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--your
honor,
the
transcript
from
mr.
fitzpatrick
demonstrates
that
judge
weiner
asked
for
a
global
resolution,
wanted
the
parties
to
attend
to
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they
asked
specifically
that
after
the
transfer
that
the
prospects
for
global
negotiation
be
considered,
and
that's
just
what
the
federal
judicial
center
had
said
in
two
major
conferences.
this
was
done
at
the
instance
of
the
judges
who
are
on
the
firing
line
in
this
litigation,
and
judge
reed--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
1991
opinion
itself
does
refer
to
that
as
one
of
the
possible
outcomes
of
the
transfers,
that
perhaps
a
global
settlement
could
be
achieved
in
this
litigation,
which
is
what
the
other
judges
had
been
suggesting,
too.
they
told
the
lawyers,
you've
got
to
do
better.
you
cannot
simply
rely
on
this
system
where
transaction
costs
eat
up
$2
out
of
$3,
where
years
and
years
go
by
and
the
courts
are
clogged
and
flooded,
and
that's
what
the
lawyers
did
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
if
this--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--if
this
were
a
litigated
matter
i
would
agree
with
that,
that
you
couldn't
override
state
law
differences,
but
the
parties
can
settle,
and
often
do
settle
in
a
way
that
varies
from
a
particular
body
of
state
law,
and
here
the
settlement
does
incorporate
reference
to
state
law,
but
the
amount
of
money
is
geared
in
part
to
state
law
standards,
but
it's
the
settlement
that's
critical.
if
an
adjudication
attempted
to
override
state
law
standards,
then
we'd
have
the
substantive
law
problem
that
you
mentioned,
but
the
parties
can
settle
on
any
terms
that
the
judge
determines
to
be
reasonable--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--many
settlements
have
such
features.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
many
settlements
have
such
features,
where
the
parties
will
resolve
an
array
of
disputes
under
an
adr
system,
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
think
judge
reed
found
that
there
was
a
very
important
safeguard
here
from
the
afl-cio's
participation.
they
negotiated
changes
in
this
agreement
to
make
it
satisfactory
to
them,
substantive
and
procedural.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
named
plaintiff,
mr.
carlo,
and
then
mr.
georgine,
were
both
officers
in
the
afl-cio.
one
was
a
union
president,
the
other
was
head
of
the
building
trades
department
of
the
afl-cio,
so--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
when
we
talk
about
adequate
representation,
this
is
a
group
that,
of
course,
has
members
in
every
disease
category.
most
of
the
people
that
fall
into
this
class
are
labor
union
members,
afl-cio
members,
so
if
there's
a
problem,
this
is
a
group
that's
in
a
position
to
say
so.
we
also
had
14
class
representatives--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
many
settlements,
of
course,
differ
from
what
would
happen
if
the
matter
were
litigated
under
state
law
principles,
and
the
settlement
here,
of
course,
did
that.
it
departed
from
what
would
happen
in
a
piece
of
litigation,
and
this
is
not,
of
course,
unprecedented.
the
agent
orange
case
is
quite
similar
to
this.
there
have
been
many
cases
like
this
where
you
have
people--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
second
circuit's
agent
orange,
the
ivy
case,
and
then
the
agent
orange
case
that
preceded
that,
and
obviously--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
this
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
14
class
representatives
all
allege
personal
injury,
and
they
demanded
valuable
relief--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
they
included
in
their
class
people
who
were
in
the
same
situation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
a
case
or
controversy
because
the
court
has
to
approve
the
settlement
and
issue
an
injunction.
this
case
depended
on
the
issuance
of
an
injunction.
it's
just
like
an
sec
case--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
the
sec
and
antitrust
division
cases
where
the
parties
come
before
the
court
with
a
complaint,
and
an
answer,
and
a
settlement,
and
the
answer
has
always
been
in
these
cases
that
because
a
judicial
act
is
needed
and
an
injunction
is
needed
there
still
is
a
live
case
or
controversy.
we
rely
on
that
body
of
cases.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
in
united
states
v.
swift
the
court
reached
that
same
conclusion.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
are
private
cases
where
the
same
concept
has
been
raised.
one
is
in
re
asbestos
litigation
from
the
fifth
circuit.
they're--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--not
here.
if
i
may
reserve
a
moment
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
point
professor
tribe
left,
that
there's
no
proof
of
adequacy
here.
in
fact,
there
was
voluminous
evidence
on
adequacy
of
representation.
the
district
court
looked
in
great
detail
at
what
these
lawyers
and
what
these
class
representatives
had
done
for
each
medical
category.
this
is
a
factual
issue,
and
the
district
court's
determination
on
these
factual
points
is
subject
to
deferential
review.
now,
professor
tribe's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
i
think
his
point
was
you
can't
just
look
at
the
end
result.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
have
to
look
at
other
things.
we
agree
with
that.
you
don't
just
look
at
the
end
result.
you
have
to
look
at
the
alignment
of
interests
of
the
representatives
and
the
vigor
of
negotiation,
the
changes
that
were
made,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
did.
this
is
a
factual
issue
which
the
district
court
was
best
positioned
to
consider.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--there's
be
no
difference.
that's
what
judge
reed
found,
that
there
would
be
no...
there's
no
practical
need
for
these
subclasses.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
same
result
would
be
reached
at
greater
expense,
because
the
district
court
found
here
that
there
were
no
conflicts
among
these
subclasses.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
is
merely
an
option,
justice
scalia,
for
people
who
want
the
option,
and
it
is
found
to
be
a
preferable
option.
those
that
don't
want
it--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--can
opt
out.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--they
do
have
a
claim.
they
have
article
iii
standing
under
this
court's
precedents.
our
research
shows
that
there
are
15
states--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--under
the
legal
certainty
test,
your
honor,
there
are
15
states
that
recognize
this
cause
of
action.
no
state
supreme
court
has
rejected
it.
there
are
also
claims
here
for
intentional
misconduct
which
we
heard
counsel
say
would
present
a
different
circumstance.
there
can
be
no
legal
certainty--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
there's
no
state
that
has
rejected
this
cause
of
action.
there
are
15
that
have
by
our
count,
and
so
the
court,
looking
at
jurisdiction,
could
not
say
with
a
legal
certainty
that
anyone
in
this
class
does
not
have
a
valid
cause
of
action.
