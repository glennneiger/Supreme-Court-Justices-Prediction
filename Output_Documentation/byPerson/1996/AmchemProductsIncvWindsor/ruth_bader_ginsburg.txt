justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
has
there
been
anything
like
this...
i'm
not
aware
that
there
has
been,
and
particularly
this
case
comes
up
because
of
an
antisuit
injunction
that
stops
every
court
in
the
country,
state
and
federal,
i
take
it,
from
dealing
with
any
of
these
claims.
we
have
one
group
i
think
from
california
saying
we
could
do
much
better
on
our
own.
how
can
you
say
that
it
doesn't
affect
substantive
rights?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
a
question.
did
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
that,
what
you're
describing,
may
fit
a
common
fraud
where
each
person
is
affected
to
a
small
degree,
but
here
you
have
a
personal
injury
suit
where
the
normal
rule
is,
i
can
go
it
alone,
and
when
a
restriction
is
made
on
that
and
says
no,
you
have
to
travel
with
all
these
other
people,
i
really
don't
understand
how
that
doesn't
involve
substantive
rights.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
personal
injury
lawsuit
where
20
defendants
are
saved
from
every
court
in
the
country
continuing
litigation?
i've
seen
that
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
but
i
don't
know
of
it
outside
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
enjoined
every
court
in
the
country,
as
this
antisuit
injunction
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
a
big
question.
the
question
is
whether
this
notice...
and
other
categories,
it
seems
to
me,
are
not
quite
as
sprawling,
and
you
don't
have
the
problem
of
people
who
don't
even
know
they're
in
the
class,
or
if
the
impossibility
for
you,
in
fact,
to
identify
someone
who
worked
around
asbestos,
then
went
off
to
some
other
occupation,
is
no
longer
a
member
of
a
union
that
might
give
notice--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
assuming...
that's
assuming
that
you
can...
maybe
the
problem
of
notice
reflects
on
the
impropriety
of
proceeding
in
this
case
at
all,
as
this
massive
class
action.
maybe
you
see
that
there
can't
be
such
a
class,
because
one...
reflecting
back
from
how
can
you
possibly
give
notice
to
some
of
the
widows
who
have
brought
suits
and
have
been
told,
you
can't
maintain
your
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
start
from
the
very--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let's
start
from
the
very
basic
premise,
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this,
but
it
was
my
understanding
that
there
is
a
right
for
one
to
litigate
one's
own
claim,
and
that's
the
basic
rule,
and
if
that's
going
to
be
displaced,
there
has
to
be
a
good
reason
for
it,
and
that
good
reason,
i
assume,
is
not
for
the
courts
to
make
up
in
the
guise
of
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
predominance
inquiry,
which
is
central,
i
think,
in
(b)(3),
certainly
changes,
and
if
you
look
at
this
going
in
you'd
say,
my
goodness,
these
are
people
who
are
suffering
from
any
number
of
diseases
accrued
at
different
times
involving
different
manufacturers.
there's
no
way
that,
looking
at
these
as
discrete
claims,
one
could
say
that
a
common
question
predominates.
you
have
different
state
laws
involved,
california
very
generous,
maine
less
generous.
you
look
at
it
and
say,
my
goodness,
this
is
just
a
hodge-podge,
i
think
was
the
word
judge
becker
used.
so
going
in
with
a
case,
looking
at
the
complaint,
one
would
conclude
no,
there's
no...
common
questions
don't
predominate,
and
then
you
look
to
the
rules,
and
i
guess
that's
what
is
bothering
me
most
about
this.
you
go
back
to
1966,
when
we
first
got
(b)(3)
class
actions,
and
you've
got
the
rules
advisory
committee
telling
this
court
and
also
congress
that
you
couldn't
even
have
mass
accident
cases
under
(b)(3).
that's
not
what
it
was
meant
for.
and
then
it
suddenly
gets
changed
to
be
something
so
much
vaster
than
was
ever
intended.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well--
--well,
but
the...
i'm
sorry.
as
i
think
most
of
the
parties
agree,
the
third
circuit
spoke
too
extremely
when
it
said
you
can't
take...
nobody
says
you
can't
take
settlement
into
account,
you
can't
have
a
settlement
class.
but
what's
key
in
this
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
is
that...
just
what
justice
souter
said,
that
23(e)
does
not
swallow
up
everything
that
went
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
shapiro...
mr.
shapiro...
mr.
shapiro,
you
mentioned
the
mdl,
and
so
i'd
like
you
to
straighten
me
out
on
one
thing.
i
thought
when
the
multidistrict
panel
sent
all
of
these
cases
to
judge
weiner
to
be
consolidated
he
was
talking
about
settling
those
cases.
the
multidistrict
panel
was
talking
about
settling
those
cases,
not
creating
this
vast
exposure-only
litigation
that
never
existed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
weiner.
but
did
the
multidistrict
panel
say,
when
we're
sending
all
these
cases
to
be
consolidated
for
pretrial
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
that
the
court
was
to
settle
not
only
those
cases
but
cases
that
hadn't
been
instituted
yet?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
a
reference
to
where
the
multidistrict
panel
said
settle
other
cases
than
these
that
were
consolidated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
agent
orange
the
closest
one
that
you
can
imagine--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
are
you
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
saying,
then,
that
even
a
back
end
opt-out
would
not
save
this
class?
i
take
it
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
so
many
of
them--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
many
of
them
will
never
see
this
notice.
many
who
do
won't
understand
it.
let
me
ask
you
a
question
similar
to
the
one
i
asked
ms.
birnbaum
in
the
preceding
argument.
if
her
position
is
right,
and
it
applies
not
only
to
fela
but
the
common
law
generally,
then
the
huge
bulk
of
these
people
don't
have
any
current
claim
at
all.
they
don't
have
any
injury.
and
so
you're
taking
people
who
don't
even
have
any
claim
now
and
saying
they're
giving
up
nothing
because
they
have
no
claim
to
settle
some
claim
that
they
might
have
in
the
future.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
have
no
claim,
then
doesn't...
isn't
that
another
reason
why
this
has
to
fall
apart?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
they
have
no
12(b)...
they
couldn't
survive
a
12(b)(6).
they
do
not
have
a
claim
for
relief
because
they
haven't
been
injured
yet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
in
most
states,
since
we're
dealing
with
a
global
thing,
most
of
these
people
wouldn't
have
any
claim
if
ms.
birnbaum
is
right,
and
if...
you
said
the
number's
only
15.
