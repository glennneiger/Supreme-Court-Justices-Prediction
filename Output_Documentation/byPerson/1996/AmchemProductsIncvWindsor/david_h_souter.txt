but
isn't
the
fairness
of
the
settlement
swallowing...
isn't
this
sort
of
the
point
of
what
the
third
circuit
was
saying,
and
that
is
that
the
fairness
inquiry
in
effect
is
swallowing
all
the
preceding
steps
that
are
normally
assumed
when
the
moment
comes
to
look
at
fairness?
take
this
as
an

and
the
reason
for
that
is,
here
they
all

and
they
like
it,
and
yet...
and
you
say
there
really
couldn't
be
any
unfairness...
or,
i'm
sorry,
there
really
couldn't
be
any
true
disparity
of
interest
unless
we
were
dealing
with
a
limited
fund
in
which
whatever
a
gets,
b
doesn't
get.
justice

so
you're
really
saying
you
can't
make
an
intelligent
fairness
determination
after
the
fact
without
knowing
the
process
by
which
the
determination
was
made,
and
that's...
i
mean,
that's
