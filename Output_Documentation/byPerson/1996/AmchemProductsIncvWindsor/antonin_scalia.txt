justice
antonin
scalia
--does
the
class
include
people
who
do
not
now
know
that
they
were
exposed?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
they
know
about
it
now
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
how
could
any
notice
be
adequate
to
those
people?
i
don't
know
i've
been
exposed,
so
you
know,
i...
let's
say
i
see
a
full
page
ad
in
the
new
york
times
that
says
those
who
have
been
exposed
to...
you
know,
have
to
join
this
lawsuit,
or
pull
out
now,
or
forever
hold
your
peace.
i
don't
even
know
that
i've
been
exposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
substantially
is
what,
80
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
virtually
everybody
who's
had
occupational
exposure
knows
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
those
exceptions?
have
they
had
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'll
take
that
on,
mr.
shapiro.
let's
just
talk
about
using
the
settlement
as
a
significant
factor
in
deciding
how
broad
the
class
can
be.
i
am
concerned
about
the
incentives
that
that
creates
for
the
class
action
counsel.
we
all
know
that
these
class
actions
don't
come
out
of
the
woods.
the
plaintiffs
don't
suddenly
collect
together.
they
are
put
together
by
counsel,
who
has
something
to
earn
by
putting
them
together.
now,
if
he
knows
that
by
achieving
a
settlement
he
can
expand
the
size
of
the
class
on
behalf
of
which
he's
suing,
will
he
not
have
an
incentive
to
settle
at
substantially
less
than
he
might
otherwise
settle?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
place
him
in
a
real
conflict
with
regard
to
his
clients
in
the
class
that
could
get
in
without
a
settlement,
in
the
class
that
would
be
a
certifiable
class
without
the
settlement?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
massive
incentive
to
bring
in
other
people
who
really
wouldn't
be
in
there
if
you
didn't
have
a
settlement,
but
then
you
strike
a
settlement
that
gives
everybody
less
than
they
might
get
had
he
just
gone
in
without
a
settlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
some
self-interest,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
shapiro,
turning...
i
have
some
problem
with
the
prospect
of
two
parties
who
are
not
in
disagreement
as
to
what
one
should
pay
and
what
the
other
should
accept
coming
to
a
court
and
saying
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
between
them.
i
mean,
i
gather
that
can
happen
afterwards,
after
there's
a
case
or
controversy
brought
before
the
court,
but
here
are
two
parties
coming
before
the
court,
and
one
says,
you
know,
i
think
i
owe
you
$200,
and
i'm
willing
to
pay
that,
and
the
other
one
says,
you
know,
i
think
you
owe
me
$200,
and
i'm
willing
to
accept
that,
and
they
bring
this
to
a
court,
and
this
is
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i'm
simplifying
it,
but
that...
isn't
that
what
you
have
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
defendants
say,
you're
right,
you
deserve
relief,
and
i'm
willing
to
pay
$2
million,
and
the
plaintiffs
say,
i'm
willing
to
take
$2
million.
where's
the
case
or
controversy?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
all
involve
federal
agencies
though,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
be
right
if
we
had
said
that,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
ignore
it,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
what
you're
saying.
it
can't
make
any
difference--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
don't
ignore
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
were
smart
enough
you'd
figure
them
out
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
was
talking
not
about
adequacy
of
representation,
but
rather
about
the
question
whether
the
settlement
achieved
gave
each
class
the
maximum
that
it
could
have
gotten.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
willing
to
leave
it
to
one
district
judge
to
decide
nationwide
what
is
fairness
as
to
all
of
these
different
plaintiffs,
some
who
haven't
gotten
the
disease,
some
who
know
that
they
have
it,
some...
i
mean,
i
can
understand
how
a
legislature
might
feel--
