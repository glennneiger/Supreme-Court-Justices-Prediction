mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
might
begin
with
the
question
of
whether
the
judicial
power
was
being
exercised
at
all
in
this
case
before
perhaps
turning
to
rule
23,
because,
like
justice
kennedy,
i
do
think
that
what
the
district
court
did,
though
judicial
in
form,
yes,
it
was
an
injunction,
yes,
it
had
all
the
trappings,
was
legislative
in
substance,
very
clearly
in
violation,
i
think,
of
article
iii
as
well
as
the
rules
enabling
act.
and
let
me
say
why
this
is
wholly
unlike
swift
and
the
other
decree
cases.
of
course
it
is
permissible
under
article
iii
for
people
who
are
actually
at
one
another's
throats,
including
an
agency
that
says
you
better
do
the
following.
unless
you
agree,
i'm
going
to
get
an
injunction.
well,
then
one
can
get
an
agreement.
but
here,
what
is
very
clear
is
that
the
only
reason
for
going
to
court
was
not
for
one
party
to
force
the
other
to
submit.
it
was
for
the
two
parties
to
take
what
would
otherwise
have
been
a
private
deal
involving,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
a
much
smaller
class,
not
all
of
the
exposure-onlys,
and
transform
it
into
a
nationwide
revision
of
tort
law
binding
throughout
the
country--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--on
anyone
who
might
sue
the
ccr
defendants.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mm-hmm.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mm-hmm.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
named
representatives
here
have
all
testified
beyond
dispute
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there
are,
justice
breyer,
many
different
problems.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
under
the
rules
enabling
act
the
problem
is
that
there
are
substantive
changes
being
made
in
state
law
in
a
way
that,
of
course,
two
private
parties
agreeing
together
could
do,
but
that
this
makes
binding
on
millions
of
people.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
in
california,
for
example,
an
asbestos
company
cannot
make
any
reference
to
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
smoked.
in
some
other
states
there
can
be
some--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--what's
different,
justice
breyer,
just
for
example,
is
that
in
many
states
people
are
not
allowed
to
give
up
in
advance
of
the
illness
occurring
through
a
general
release
the
right
to
sue,
like
the
woman
in
this
morning's
decision
who
didn't
know
until
her
husband
died
various
of
the
relevant
facts.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
but
what's
being
extinguished--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--what's
being
extinguished
is
not
just
the
metro
north
actions.
that
is,
the
kinds
of
actions,
for
example,
that
the
widow
in
this
morning's
case
involving
ingallls
shipbuilding
brought.
her
claims,
since
probably
some
ccr
defendants
made
some
of
the
stuff
that
killed
her
husband
in
that
shipyard,
her
claim
not
just
for
exposure,
but
she's
the
widow
of
someone
who
got
cancer,
is
extinguished
by
this
settlement.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
if--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--first,
some
states
do
not
allow
people
who
have
not
yet
experienced
something
to
bind
themselves
that
far
into
the
future.
second,
the
most
important
point
is,
many
members
of
this
class
haven't
been
born
yet.
others
haven't
married
into
the
class
yet.
many,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
have
no
clue
that
they
were
exposed.
it's
not
as
though
you're
having
a
tete-a-tete
with
particular
individuals.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no
question--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
was
an
argument
about
future
alleged
misconduct.
it
was
not
only
imminently
litigable,
it
was,
as
the
chief
justice
referred
to
it,
a
contemplated
lawsuit.
it
would
have
been
a
lawsuit
had
there
not
been
this
settlement.
in
this
case
there
would
have
been,
and
this
is
undisputed,
no
suit
on
behalf
of
millions
of
merely
exposed
individuals--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
there
had
never
been--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--oh,
in
some
states,
as
to
some
of
them
there
might
have
been
a
case,
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
do
know--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
do
know
that
class
counsel
had
never
brought,
and
this
is
undisputed,
a
claim
on
behalf
of
someone
merely
exposed.
ccr--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
not--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
stevens,
i'm
sorry.
i
certainly
believe
that
as
to
those
who
are
dying
of
cancer
and
many
of
the
others
there's
a
case
or
controversy.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
this
court's
jurisprudence
requires
in
a
class
action
that
there
be
an
injury
in
fact
by
everyone,
and
the
absence
of
a
case
or
controversy
here
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
entire--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
saying
no
injury
in
fact
as
to
some
members,
but
(b),
more
important,
no
case
or
controversy
as
to
the
entire
phony
complaint
which
was
filed,
admittedly,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
court
to
put
in
place
this--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--could
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
just
want
to
answer--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
fact
that
it's
too
big,
too
diverse
can't
possibly
be
certified
without,
as
justice
souter
suggested,
making
the
mere
settlement
somehow
the
sufficient
answer
to
all
of
the
questions
under
rule
23
is
a
different
matter.
the
absence
of
a
genuine
controversy
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
entire
case...
and
this
has
never
really
been
denied...
was
brought
not
to
obtain
the
relief
the
complaint
requested,
money
for
monitoring,
money
for
mere
exposure,
money
for
increased
risk,
it
was
brought
solely
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
court,
giving
it
supposedly
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
nationwide
injunction--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
rights
of
third
parties
are
not
sacrificed
in
those
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
what's
happening
is
that
the
agency,
the
department
of
justice,
is
saying
that
instead
of
taking
you
to
court
and,
if
you
insist,
we
will
take
you
to
court,
we
will
agree
to
desist
from
that
if
you
will
agree
to--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
is
this
difference.
they
can
only
take
the
defendants
to
court
with
the
defendants'
consent
here,
because
in
this
case
it
is
recognized
that
this
class
could
not
be
certified
for
litigation
so
that,
unlike
litigable
matters
of
the
sort
to
which
you
referred
in
which
the
plaintiff
has
some
leverage,
this
is
in
the
unusual
circumstance
where,
since
absent
the
defendant's
agreement
there's
no
settlement,
and
since
absent
a
settlement
there
could
be
no
conceivable
finding,
even
a
pretense
of
a
finding
that
the
rule
23
factors
are
satisfied,
it
means
that
the
defendant
really
holds
all
the
cards.
it
is
not
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
has
some
meaningful
leverage
and
then
they
compromise
and
the
court
in
enforcing
the
compromise
issues
an
injunction.
here,
the
injunction
has
the
effect
of
replacing
a
system
of
tort
law
that
one
might
find
fault
with
with
an
administrative
scheme.
the
court
would
have
had
no
power
whatsoever
to
do
that
ordinarily,
and
what
mr.
shapiro
says
is,
the
reason
it
has
power
to
do
that
here
is
because
this
is
not
an
adjudication.
well,
of
course,
the
only
power
that
a
federal
article
iii
court
has
is
the
power
to
adjudicate,
and
when...
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
with
subclasses,
justice
breyer,
perhaps.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
way...
under
the
rule,
one
can
identify
a
subgroup
that
is
more
homo...
relatively
homogeneous,
so
that
one
could
get
a
set
of
typical
representatives
who
could
adequately
advance
the
interests
of
those,
for
example,
with
advanced
mesothelioma,
or
those
with
pleural
thickening.
those
subgroups...
and
this
was
going
on
before
this
case
happened.
ninety-nine
point
eight
percent
of
the
cases
against
ccr
were
being
settled
by
ccr.
various
subgroups
can
be
managed.
what
causes
the
problem
here
is
the
fact
that
the
understandable
desire
by
these
20
companies
to
get
what
they
might
have
gotten
from
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
namely
protection
into
the
indefinite
future...
they
don't
in
fact
say
the
sky's
the
limit.
they
don't
want
to
spend
an
infinite
amount.
they
want
to
limit
their
exposure.
that's
what
creates
the
inherent
tradeoffs
within
the
class.
congress
is
where
those
tradeoffs
could
be
resolved.
if
they
went
to
congress,
one
could
then
imagine
a
legislative
solution.
or
if,
instead,
subgroups
formed
classes...
that
is,
there
might
be
a
class
of
people
with
cancer--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
third
circuit,
of
course,
did
not
ignore
the
existence
of
the
settlement.
it
went
on
at
some
length
to
show
how
the
settlement
shed
light
on
the
conflicts
involved
here.
there
was
no
inflation
adjustment,
which
wouldn't
have
mattered
much
to
people
who
had
a
life
expectancy
of
5
years
from
cancer,
but
would
have
mattered
a
great
deal
to
people
who
might
get
sick,
if
at
all,
only
in
25
years.
all
of
the
consortium
claims
were
resolved
at
zero.
that
would
matter
a
lot
more
to
the
widows
than
it
would
to
people
who
lived
alone.
so
he
looked
at
the
settlement,
and
though
perhaps,
as
justice
souter
and
others
may
have
suggested,
there's
some
rhetoric
in
judge
becker's
opinion
that
suggests
that
the
settlement
doesn't
matter,
his
own
holding
makes
clear
that
he
looked
at
it,
he
paid
attention
to
it.
but
what
he
did
say
was
this,
and
i
think
this
is
clearly
right,
and
very
important.
the
settlement
can't
in
itself
suffice
because
there
is
no
objective
test
for
what
the
right
tradeoff
is
unless
the
groups
with
different
interests
are
adequately
represented.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
settlement
looks
reasonable.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
when
he
says,
as
if
it
were
going
to
be
litigated,
if
i
interpreted
that
to
mean
what
mr.
shapiro
does,
namely,
we
must
be
blind
to
the
settlement
in
figuring
out
whether
the
criteria
of
rule
23
are
met,
i
think
it
would
be
wrong,
because
things
like
management
of
a
complex
case
might
shed
a
lot
of
light
on
that
by
looking
at
the
settlement,
but
you
don't
have
to
read
it
that
way.
i
would
interpret
that
to
mean
that
we
must
avoid
a
search...
we
must
avoid
looking
at
this
as
though
the
questions
were
no
longer
those
of
typicality,
predominance,
superiority,
and
adequate
representation,
but
merely
the
fairness
of
the
settlement.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
i
think
in
that
respect
he's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
stevens,
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
say
yes
to
that
because
i
thought
i
could
come
up
with
managerial
examples
in
which
that
would
be
possible,
but
i
think
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
answer
really
ought
to
be
no,
and
they're
very
fundamental.
they
relate
to
the
text
of
rule
23
and
whether
it
can
possibly
be
stretched
to
confer
judicial
power
to
impose
a
binding
order
on
an
entire
class
where
the
class
representatives
could
not
be
deputized
to
litigate
it,
and
with
article
iii
and
due
process
problems.
let
me
just
say
a
word
about
each.
as
far
as
the
text
of
the
rule
is
concerned,
it
talks
constantly
about
circumstances
in
which
people
may
"sue
as
representative
parties"
and,
most
importantly,
there's
no
language
in
the
rule
that
confers
affirmative
power
to
impose
a
binding
settlement
on
the
class.
it's
a
negative
thing.
rule
23(e)
limits.
it
says
that
you
cannot
dismiss
or
compromise
a
class
action
without
judicial
approval.
i
think
you
have
to
twist
those
words
out
of
shape
to
infer
from
them
a
power
to
judicially
impose
a
settlement
where
you
concede
that
there
could
not
have
been
a
class
action.
i
also
think
that
there's
an
intrinsic
article
iii
problem,
just
apart
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
construing
any
rule
of
procedure
to
create
circumstances
where
an
article
iii
court
may
bind
nonparties,
but
only
so
long
as
the
parties
who
seek
such
an
order
have
settled
all
of
the
disputes
between
them
and
have
therefore
put
no
controversy
before
the
court.
i
mean,
that's
what
it
would
come
down
to.
it
would
basically
say
the
one
precondition
of
getting
the
court
to
exercise
its
judicial
power
is
that
you
guys
don't
disagree.
i
think
that
stands
article
iii
on
its
head.
i
think
there
is
a
third
problem,
and
it
goes
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
incentive
structures.
i
mean,
apart
from
the
incentive
to
load
up
the
class
with
additional
people,
which
may
be
bad
for
a
number
of
reasons,
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
point,
and
that
is
that
representative
parties,
as
the
rule
calls
them,
who
concededly
cannot
carry
on
adversary
class
litigation
against
a
defendant...
which
is
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
right
+/?
are
necessarily
hobbled
inherently
in
negotiating
with
that
defendant
and
thereby
playing
the
role
that
due
process
and
rule
23(a)(4)
demands,
namely,
fairly
and
adequately
protecting
the
interests
of
the
class,
because
by
definition...
by
definition,
representative
parties
in
that
situation
need
the
defendant's
cooperation
to
get
the
class
off
the
ground
at
all.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
it's
an
implication
of
my
position
that
one
apple
of
the
wrong
flavor
spoils
the
barrel.
the
question--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
maybe--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
guess
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
rule
that
makes
it
possible
for
a
nonlitigable
case
to
give
rise
to
a
binding
decree.
maybe
you're
saying
that
the
rule
should
be
changed
to
make
that
possible.
i'm
talking
about
the
rule
as
it
is.
but
i'm
also
suggesting
that
any
change
in
the
rule
that
makes
the
power
of
an
article
iii
court
to
bind
millions
of
people
dependent
on
the
complete
agreement
of
those
before
it
is
troublesome
at
a
minimum
under
article
iii--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
under
rule
82
you
wouldn't
read
the
rules
that
way.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
because
a
back
end
opt-out,
justice
ginsburg,
would
have
to
have
preconditions
that
the
court
would
set.
that
is
that
in
the
heart
valve
and
other
cases
a
back
end
opt-out
helps
a
great
deal
on
the
issue
of
notice,
on
the
issue
of
meaningful
choice,
so
that,
for
example,
the
widow
in
this
morning's
case
might
have
been
in
a
position
to
make
certain
decisions
after
her
husband
died
that
she
wasn't
before.
but
a
back
end
opt-out
does
not
prevent
this
from
being
a
binding
exercise
of
federal
judicial
power,
otherwise...
i
mean,
if
they
didn't
need
that
they
would
include
it
in
their
inventory
settlements
that
they
settled
on
the
side
at
quite
a
premium,
and
therefore
i
think
that
although
the
superiority
determination
under
23(b)(3)
might
come
out
differently
with
a
back
end
opt
out,
i
don't
think
the
article
iii
problem
or
the
textual
problem
would
be
solved,
nor
would
the
leverage
problem.
that
is,
the
fundamental
problem
of
any
deal,
even
if
it
looks
good
or
better
because
people
don't
have
to
make
the
kinds
of
impossible
choices
that
this
settlement
imposes
on
them
30
years
before
they
come
down
with
a
terrible
disease,
even
though
it
would
be
improved,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
the
case
that
the
heterogeneity
of
class,
or
the
inability
of
the
representative
plaintiffs
adequately
to
represent
the
whole
class
or
anything
else
brings
the
situation
to
the
posture
justice
stevens
put,
namely,
but
for
the
settlement
i
simply
could
not
certify
this
class,
that
gives
such
leverage
to
the
defendant
that
in
effect
you
are
handing
to
the
adversary
power
over
the
state
law
claims
of
absent
members
of
this
class
in
a
way
that
changes
their
substance,
the
substance
of
those
state
law
rights
in
violation
of
the
rules
enabling
act,
and
also
in
a
way
that
violates
i
think
both
hansberry
v.
lee
and
richards
v.
jefferson
county.
that
is,
the
point
about
both
your
opinion,
i
think,
in
richards
v.
jefferson
county,
justice
stevens,
and
hansberry
v.
lee
many
years
earlier,
was
that
the
people
who
speak,
even
in
the
negotiation
process,
as
you
stressed
in
matsushita,
the
people
who
speak
for
others
have
to
be
in
a
position
in
terms
of
an
alignment
of
interest
to
fairly
represent
them.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
findings--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
that's...
not
quite,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
the
court
was
extremely
careful...
at
page
49a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
you
see
how
careful
judge
becker
was
to
avoid
disturbing
findings
of
historical
or
empirical
fact,
so
that
there
were
no
findings--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
are
two
different
concepts
of
representation.
the
word
representation
in
23(a)
talks
about
the
ability
of
the
representative
plaintiffs.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
he...
as
to
that,
what
did
he
find
as
to
their
ability?
it
was
in
his
conclusions
of
law
section
to
begin
with,
and
what
he
said
as
to
adequate
representation
was--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
this
is...
no,
judge
reed,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
judge
reed
said,
and
it's
at
pages
229a
to
230a
of
the
certiorari
appendix,
that
so
long
as
all
class
members
are
united
in
asserting
a
common
right,
such
as
achieving
the
maximum
possible
recovery,
there's
adequate
representation.
now,
that's
a
conclusion
of
law.
it's
an
obviously
incorrect
conclusion
of
law.
as
to
predominance
he
said
the
only--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
[laughter]
but
not
from
a
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
you'd
said
it
recently
enough.
[laughter]
take
predominance
at
226a
of
the
certiorari
appendix.
the
predominant
question
he
identifies
is
whether
the
settlement
is
fair,
reasonable,
and
adequate
for
the
class,
and
far
from
caricaturing
petitioner's
position,
as
mr.
shapiro
says
i'm
doing,
let
me
simply
just
turn
to
his
brief.
he
says
at,
i
guess
page
42
of
the
blue
brief,
says,
right
in
the
middle,
the
legal
and
factual
questions
that
remain
now
that
we
have
a
proposed
settlement
therefore
relate
solely...
solely...
to
the
fairness
of
the
settlement
as
the
district
court
concluded,
and
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
14
he
says,
the
questions
that
remain
were
common
to
class
members.
is
the
deal
fair
and
reasonable?
this
kind
of
reverse
engineering,
you
know,
trying
to
figure
out
if
the
incommensurable
and
conflicting
interests
of
people
who
are
perfectly
well,
who
won't
get
sick
until
perhaps,
if
ever,
the
year
2030,
and
others,
an
effort
to
figure
out
if
the
incommensurable
tradeoffs
among
them
was
made
in
a
way
that
fairly
represented
their
interests,
as
though
you
could
apply
some
objective
scale
backwards,
won't
work.
that's
why
giving
the
kind
of
weight
to
this
fairness
inquiry,
which
is
really
just
a
way
of
looking
when
the
dust
has
settled
at
whether
the
thing
looks
really
gross,
giving
so
much
weight
to
the
fairness
inquiry
and
essentially
displacing
the
inquiry
that
is
indispensable
if
due
process
is
to
be
protected
and
the
integrity
of
class
action
law
is
to
be
preserved,
is
wholly
indefensible.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
whichever
way
the
question
that
was
presented
is
answered,
the
judgment
here
would
be,
i
think,
affirmed
because
the
basis--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--my
position
is
that
it
would
be
wrong...
that
under
rule
23,
the
existence
of
a
settlement
should
not
be
ignored
when
it
is
relevant
to
answering
the
questions
put
in
rule
23.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
it
often
is.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
not.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
ought
to
be
no,
but
that's
not--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
no--
[laughter]
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
it
can--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
can
inform
you
of
a
lot
of
things.
that
is,
it--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
because--
[laughter]
--no
one
has
a
crystal
ball.
the
settlement
in
this
case...
for
example,
i
do
think
that
in
this
case
the
degree
to
which
judge
becker
looked
at
the
settlement
to
reveal
how
the
tradeoffs
worked
might
have
been
unnecessary.
that
might
have
been
obvious
in
the...
to
begin
with,
no
settlement
could
have
cured
the
intractable
problems
of
the
heterogeneity
of
this
class,
but
it
might
be
the
case
when
you
looked
at
the
settlement,
no
matter
how
smart
you
were,
that
it
pointed
something
out
to
you
that
you
hadn't
realized
about
the
situation
that
would
enable
you
to
see
that
what
appeared
to
be
a
divergence
in
the
class
really
wasn't.
that
didn't
happen
here,
but
it
sure
can't
be
said--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
other...
if
the
other
requirements
of
the
rule
were
met
or
were
not
met?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
if
they
were
all
separately
represented
in
putting
the
deal
together,
i
think
that
sounds
like
a
perfectly
reasonable--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
enough
money
to
go
around
suggests
that
there's
some
pie
in
the
sky
whose
size--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
know.
the
fact
is,
if
in
your
hypothetical
these
18
subclasses
were
all
represented
by
the
same
two
guys,
and
not
separately
represented,
i
think
no
one
is
smart
enough
to
look
at
that
and
say,
oh,
i
can
tell
that
even
though
their
interests
are
in
conflict,
they
got
as
good
a
deal
as
they
would
have
gotten
otherwise,
because
there
isn't
any
as
good
a
deal
out
there.
the
question
is,
there
are
a
lot
of
different
ways
of
carving
up
this
pie.
maybe,
as
was
suggested
in
the
earlier
argument,
the
right
thing
is
to
reserve
most
of
the
money
for
the
people
who
get
very,
very
sick,
and
not
to
worry
so
much
about
medical
monitoring,
but
that's
not
an
inevitable
view.
somebody
might
say,
if
they
really
were
into
preventive
medicine,
no,
you
really
ought
to
reserve
more
money
for
the
medical
monitoring
so
that
less
of
them
will
get
sick
in
the
future.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
exactly
right,
justice
souter--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
that
no
determination
about
the
result
will
quite
do.
i
mean,
you
know,
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating.
well,
in
this
case
proof
is
unavailable.
there
is
no
qed.
there's
no
objective
test,
and
you
know,
what
might
please
me
might
poison
someone
else.
there
are
inherent--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
