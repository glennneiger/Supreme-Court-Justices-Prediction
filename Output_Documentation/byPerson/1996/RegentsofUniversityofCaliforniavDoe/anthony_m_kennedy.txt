justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
was
discussion
in
the
hess
case
of
the
potential
for
judgments
to
reach
or
not
reach
the
state
treasury.
we
seemed
to
think
that
was
important
in
the
hess
case.
why
is
that
not
important
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
that
the
discussion
there
simply
was
a
way
for
us
to
inquire
or
measure
the
connection
between
the
bi-state
entity
and
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
these
cases
involving
universities,
is
it
important
for
us
to
inquire
whether,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
there
is
sovereign
immunity
that
attaches
to
the
institution,
or
is
it
not
important,
because
sovereign
immunity
can
always
be
waived?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
those
statutes,
do
you
think,
supersede
the
california
supreme
court's
decision,
the
1899
decision
where
they...
in
the
royer
case
where
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
the
university,
while
a
governmental
institution,
is
not
clothed
with
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
and
it's
not
a
sovereign?
do
we
just
ignore
that
sentence,
or
has
it
been
superseded
by
statute,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
you
say--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
say
it's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
that's...
that
makes
the
further
assumption
that
the
treasury
of
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california
is
not
part
of
the
state,
and
i'm
sure
the
counsel
for
the
appellants
are
going
to
tell
us
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
very
substantial
separation
that
the
california
constitution
decrees
for
the
university
is
to
clothe
it
with
attributes
of
sovereignty
and
to
make
sure
that
it
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
state,
actually
separate
from
the
legislative
and
executive
branches.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
to
say
that
it's
not
part
of
the
state's
liability
in
a
way
elides
the
question,
because
the
treasury
of
the
university
of
california
are
state
funds
in
one
sense--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
in
a
very
important
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they're
in
control
of
another
state
entity
which
has
to...
which
happens
to
be
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california.
