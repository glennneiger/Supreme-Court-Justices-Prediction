we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-1694...
the
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-1694,
regents
of
the
university
of
california
v.
john
doe.
mr.
miller,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--haven't
we
held
in
one
of
our
decisions
that
even
though
the
state
may...
state
law
may
say
it's...
an
entity
is
suable
in
state
court,
that
does
not
conclude
the
eleventh
amendment
inquiry
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
miller.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
believe
my
colleagues
do,
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
gayer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
if
the
university
is
just
a
facade,
mr.
gayer,
perhaps
you
should
sue
only
the
federal
government,
not
the
university.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
university
says
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
over
it
either,
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
have
any
ready
appeal
from
a
discovery
order
pretrial.
i
mean,
a
discovery
order
isn't
appealable
as
a
matter
of
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
just
one
form
of
good
lawyering?
you
don't
have
any
right
to
appeal
the...
either
your
order
to
discover,
or
the
discovery
order
makes...
the
discovery
request
is
reasonable.
you
raise
what
you
can
at
a
different
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
subsumed
generally
means
a
smaller
question
included
in
a
larger
question.
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
larger
question
is
included
in
a
smaller
question,
which
is
quite
different.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gayer.
mr.
miller,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
the
case
is
submitted.
