justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
converse
proposition,
not
waiver,
but
could
a
state...
let's
take
a
cement
plant
as
an
example...
go
into
the
cement
business
and
create
the
cement
administration
entity
as
an
arm
of
the
state
and
say
it
shall
not
be
immune...
it
shall
be
immune
from
all
suit
in
federal
court
and
also
in
state
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
not
respected
in
international
law
any
more.
there
is
an
exception
to
international
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
commercial
activities
of
governments,
and
that
may
well
be
ex...
i
mean,
it
isn't
out
of
the
question
that
that
could
be
extended
to
the
eleventh
amendment
as
well,
but
that's
not
involved
here
anyway,
is
it?
i
mean,
this
is
not
a
commercial--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
binding?
is
that
not...
that
will
be
reviewable
in
court,
certainly.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
didn't
think
we
had
taken
this
case
to
go
into
whether,
absent
the
indemnification
provision,
there
is
sovereign
immunity
or
not.
you
know,
there
are
a
million
different
entities,
and
each
one
of
them
have
different
considerations,
and
we
normally
don't
take
up
each
case
to
decide
whether
the
court
of
appeals
got
it
right
that
applying
the
normal
factors
this
was
the
state
or
this
wasn't
the
state.
i
thought
the
only
issue
before
us
here
was
whether,
assuming
it
is
otherwise
the
state,
the
indemnification
feature
makes
a
change.
that's
a
point
of
law
i
think
we
can
grapple
with
that
has,
you
know,
permanent
significance
nationwide.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
read--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
read
the
question
presented.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
paid
for
the
government's
indemnification
promise
as
well.
i
mean,
you
don't
think
that
promise
is
made
for
free.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
contract
would...
you
know,
the
university
would
have
demanded
a
lot
more
money
for
the
contract
if
that
indemnification
provision
weren't
in
it,
so
the
payment
isn't
the
difference
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
deny
that
they
would
have
demanded
much
more
reimbursement
from
the
federal
government
if
they
did
not
have
the
federal
government's
indemnification
guarantee?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
had
to
be
either
self-insurers,
or
had
to
buy
insurance
from
an
insurance
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
how
would
you
speculate
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
cost
is
too
high.
justice
antonin
scalia
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
university
would
pay
for
a
private
insurance
policy,
is
there
any
other
feature
that
would
distinguish
justice
o'connor's
question
from
the
case
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
an
entity
of
any
single
state.
i
mean,
it
was
a
totally
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.--
--you
stand
squarely
with
the
dissent
in
hess.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
it
wasn't
such
a...
i
mean,
it
was
an
understandable
omission,
inasmuch
as
the
ninth
circuit
had
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
the
state
universities
were,
indeed,
the
state
for
purposes
of
sovereign
immunity,
haven't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
you
didn't
want
to
antagonize
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
you
were
there
to
please
them,
just
as
you're
here
to
please
us--
[laughter]
--and
they
wouldn't
have
been
pleased
at
your
calling
their
whole
circuit
law
into
question.
