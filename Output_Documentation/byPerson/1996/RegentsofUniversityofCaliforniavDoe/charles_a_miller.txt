mr.
charles
a.
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
for
review
in
this
case
is
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
lost
if
the
state
or
a
state
entity
has
a
claim
for
indemnification
or
reimbursement
for
any
judgment
entered
against
it.
here,
the
potential
indemnitor
is
the
united
states
department
of
energy.
the
issue
arises
in
the
context
of
a
breach
of
contract
action
brought
in
federal
court
on
diversity
grounds
where
the
plaintiff
is
a
citizen
of
new
york
and,
thus,
the
issue
does
not
implicate
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment
that
the
court
has
focused
on
in
a
number
of
cases,
most
recently
in
the
seminole
tribe
case
of
last
year,
for
even
under
the
most
narrow
view
of
the
scope
of
the
amendment
the
question
presented
in
this
case
would
need
to
be
addressed.
the
ninth
circuit
court
held
that
the
university
lost
its
immunity
in
this
case
because
in
this
particular
case
it
had
a
claim
for
indemnification
against
the
united
states
department
of
energy.
the
core
error
of
the
court
below
was
its
premise
that
in
each
case
involving
a
state
entity
the
court
can
consider,
and
parties
can
litigate,
the
question
of
the
payment
source
that
would
be
used
to
satisfy
a
judgment
that
might
be
entered
in
that
particular
case.
nothing
in
the
court's
eleventh
amendment
cases
supports
that
view,
and
we
believe
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
terms,
the
meaning,
and
the
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
core
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
to
withhold
jurisdiction
from
federal
courts
and
to
withhold
the
exercise
of
federal
judicial
power
against
a
state
in
respect
of
that
state's
sovereignty.
under
the
ninth
circuit
approach,
federal
judicial
power
is
potentially
exercised
against
the
state
or
its
entity
in
virtually
every
case,
or
any
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
there
is
some
payment
source
for
the
judgment
that
might
be
entered
in
the
case
that
would
satisfy
the
judgment
and
that
would
avoid
payment
of
that
judgment
directly
from
the
state
treasury.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
with
this
one
qualification.
we
acknowledge
that
at
some
point
any
entity,
not
the
state
itself,
may
have
to
be
subject
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
it
is
a
state
entity--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--for
eleventh
amendment
purposes,
and
it
would
be
looked
at
with
its
overall
character.
if
in
some
case
there
were
an
agency
of
the
state
which
was
entirely
supported
by
indemnification
from
an
outside
source
like
the
federal
government,
in
that
hypothetical
situation
conceivably
the
factor
of
indemnification
would
be
relevant.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
in
fact,
your
honor,
yes,
and
beyond
that,
that
the
entity
was
established
on
the
premise--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--that
its...
the
state
funds
would
never
be
reached.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that's
the
position.
whether
it's
an
indemnification,
insurance
claim,
a
possible
claim
over
or
against
a
third
party,
a
possible
joint
tortfeasor,
anything
of
the
sort.
none
of
those
possibilities
we
say
should
be
relevant,
and
yet
the
ninth
circuit
court
decision
would
seem
to
make
any
one
of
those
possibilities
relevant
to
a
determination
in
a
particular
case
as
to
whether
a
state
entity
would
be
entitled
to
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
two
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
in
the
hess
case
the
inquiry
that
the
court
made
was
whether
that
bi-state
entity
there,
the
path,
had
been
established
by
the
two
states
involved,
new
york
and
new
jersey,
with
an
intention
that
those
states
be
responsible
for
its
various
debts,
and
in
that
case
the
court
looked
at
that
overall
structure
and
concluded
that
the
states
did
not
intend
their
treasuries
to
be
responsible.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
that
was
the
standard
that
the
court
announced
when
it
made
that...
when
it
took
those
factors
into
account.
the
court
asked--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--that
is
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
that
was
going
to
be
my
second
point,
that
the
court
in
the
hess
case
adopted
a
standard
which
started
with
a
presumption
against
cloaking
that
particular
entity
with
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
required
a
demonstration
that
not
only
the
states
involved
intended
for
the
agency
to
have
their
sovereign
power,
but
that
the
congress
agreed
with
it.
that's
not
the
standard
that
would
apply
in
judging
whether
an
arm
of
the
state
is
entitled
to
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
but
even
under
that
approach
there
have
been
situations
where
a
bi-state
entity
has
been
found
to
have
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
i
think
of
the
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit
of
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
authority,
which
justice
ginsburg's
opinion
cited
in
the
hess
case,
i
think,
but
that
was
again
an
application
of
a
special
standard
for
the
bi-state
entity
situation.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that's
unquestionably
true,
your
honor,
and
were
a
judgment
to
be
entered
on
this
breach
of
contract
case,
claim
against
the
university,
the
university
would
be
legally
liable,
and
all
of
the
consequences
that
would
flow
from
having
had
a
court
make
a
legal
determination
of
a
violation
of
someone's
rights
would
apply
in
the
case.
the
university,
to
be
sure,
under
the
contract
here
would
look
to
the
department
of
energy
to
satisfy
the
monetary
judgment
awarded
by
the
court,
and
it
would
hope,
in
the
unlikely
event
that
this
occurs,
that
the
department
would
respond,
but
if
it
didn't,
the
university
would
be
on
the
hook
to
pay
the
judgment.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
it's
an
element,
your
honor,
of
the
inquiry,
the
ultimate
inquiry
which
this
court
announced
in
the
mount
healthy
case,
and
i
think
it's
been
repeated
again
in
the
hess
case
and
others,
was
what
is
the
intention
of
the
state
in
establishing
the
entity?
did
the
state
intend
this
entity
to
exercise
state
sovereign
powers?
whether
that
particular
entity
has
state
sovereign
immunity
could
be
relevant
to
that
inquiry.
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
a
general
state
statute
that
explains
just
exactly
how,
and
to
what
extent,
the
state
waives
its
sovereign
immunity
for
itself
and
its
entities,
and
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california
are
explicitly
named
as
one
of
the
entities
covered
by
that
provision.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
that
sentence
has
to
be
read
for
precisely
what
it
said.
the
court
pursued
it
by
saying
the
state
is
an
instrument...
i
mean,
the
regents
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
state.
it
is
not,
however,
the
state
itself,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
state,
what
the
supreme
court
was
saying,
and
for
that
reason,
it
said,
it
can
be
subjected
to
legislative
enactments.
in
that
case,
it
was
enactments
relating
to
the
probate--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
a
waiver
of
federal
court
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
must
be
explicit,
and
is
not
accomplished
simply
by
a
general
waiver.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it
could.
it
would
have
to
make
a
decision
that
it
wants
the
cement
operation
to
be
part
of
the
state
government,
to
be
clothed
with
the
rights
and
attributes
of
state
sovereignty.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
don't
think
there
are
any
federal
limits,
your
honor,
because
the
whole
point
here
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
to
respect
state
sovereignty
and
the
state's
decision
as
to
how
to
organize
itself
to
carry
out
its
governmental
functions,
and
if
the
state
decides
hypothetically
that
the...
operating
a
cement
plant
is
a
sovereign
function
it
wants
to
undertake,
that
decision
should
be
respected.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
it's
not
involved
in
this
case
but
i'm
happy
to--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--comment
on
it,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
this
court
has
looked
at
the
commercial
versus
governmental
distinction
in
a
number
of
contexts
and
has
tended
to
find
it
wanting
in
every
case.
the
most
prominent
one
i'm
thinking
of
is
the
garcia
case,
where
it
rejected
that
basis
for
distinguishing
between
functions
of
governmental
entities
that
would
be
beyond
federal
regulation.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
think
what
you'd
be
looking
at
would
be
the
university
as
a
whole,
and
the
whole
point
of
this
case
is
that
you've
got
to
look
at
the
university
as
a
whole
and
examine
its
overall
character.
and
the
fact
that
it
happens
to
have
a
particular
operation
that
someone
might
say
looks
more
commercial
in
nature,
just
as
one
might
say
providing
parking
lots
for
the
faculty
is
a
little
more
commercial
in
nature
than
a
governmental...
one
could
break
this
down
and
in
every
case
perhaps
find
some
basis
for
arguing
that
there
is
an
exception
to
the
immunity,
and
under
such
an
approach
i
think
in
the
end
there
would
be
no
immunity,
because
the
university
and
every
other
state
entity
would
have
to
defend
itself
in
every
case
against
the
contention
that
in
that
particular
case
its
functions
are
not
protected
by
the
immunity,
and
instead
of
having
an
immunity
suit,
which
is
what
was
intended
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
what
you'd
have
would
be--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say,
justice
stevens,
that
in
the
context
that
we're
talking
about
here,
which
is
how
does
the
state
organize
itself
to
carry
out
functions,
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
that
states
elect
their
form
of
organization
or
their
activities
based
upon
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
applies,
and
no
one
would
make
such
a
suggestion,
so
if
a
state,
to
take
your
hypothetical,
decides--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--i
don't
know
of
any
evidence
that
any
state
in
fact
takes
that
kind
of
consideration
into
account.
at
least
until
that
evidence
was
present
it
would
seem
to
me
not
worth
distorting
the
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment
simply
to
protect
against
that
somewhat
unlikely
scenario.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
you
may
ask
why
is
that
the
case,
and
my
response
would
be
because
the
minute
you
start
breaking
down
the
activity
of
an
entity
function
by
function,
activity
by
activity,
you
are
inviting
in
every
case
an
opportunity
for
litigation
in
the
federal
court
as
to
whether
or
not
that
particular
entity
is
entitled
to
immunity
in
that
particular
case.
and
that
series
of
events
has
as
its
ultimate
consequence
the
evisceration
of
the
immunity
that
the
eleventh
amendment
was
intended
to
present,
and
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
a
federal
question
case
or
a
diversity
case
like
this
case,
where
the
issue
involved
is
one
of
state
law,
and
it
seems
to
us
in
that
situation
the
cases
of
this
court
are
clear
that
the
entity
needs
to
be
viewed
as
a
whole.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice--
