justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
federal
limit
on
the
extent
to
which
a
state
can
create
subdivisions
that
will
be
entitled
to
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course,
if
you
applied
that
distinction
here
you'd
be
on
the
proprietary
side
of
the
distinction,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
there
are
clearly
some
things
that
the
government
would
do
that
are
purely
governmental...
i
mean,
carrying
out
government
policy
in
one
way
or
another.
you're
saying
there
is
no...
you're
just
saying
there
is
no
valid
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
function,
and
there's
a
lot
of
support
for
that,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
why
they
wouldn't.
if
they
go
into
the
cement
business,
as
colorado
did,
why,
they
might
take
that
into
account.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
legitimate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
i'd
like
to
make
sure
i
understand
one
part
of
your
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
applied
this
five-factor
test,
the
first
factor
whether
this
money
judgment
would
be
satisfied
out
of
state
funds,
and
they
said
it
would
not
be
because
of
the
indemnity
agreement.
you
are
arguing,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
even
without
the
indemnity
agreement,
the
judgment
would
not
have
been
satisfied
out
of
state
funds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
but...
so
we're
not...
what's...
we're
only
addressing
the
indemnity
question,
or
are
we
supposed
to
decide
the
whole
case?
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
this
focuses
on...
everything
focuses
on
point
1
in
their
five-factor
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
opponent
agree
that
it
would
not
be
satisfied
out
of
state
funds
even
without
the
indemnity
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me
for
being
so
slow
to
grasp
this,
but
in
the
dissenting
opinion
the
judge...
dissenting
judge
said,
no
one
has
disputed
that
a
judgment
against
the
university
of
california
is
a
legal
obligation
of
the
state
of
california.
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
you
argue
in
the
court
below
that
even
without
the
indemnity
agreement
the
judgment
could
not
have
been
satisfied
out
of
state
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
gayer,
if
you
did
not
call
into
question...
i
don't
think
your
job
is
to
please
the
court.
your
job
is
to
represent
your
client,
and
if,
on
behalf
of
your
client,
you
did
not
challenge
a
line
of
authority
in
the
ninth
circuit,
i'm
not
sure
you
can
challenge
it
for
the
first
time
up
here,
despite
everybody
else's
saying
how
important
it
is
to
be
friendly
to
the
court.
