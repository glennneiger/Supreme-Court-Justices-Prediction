mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
for
two
reasons.
first,
regardless
of
whether
a
state
entity
has
a
potential
right
of
indemnity
from
a
third
party,
the
state's
sovereign
interests
are
implicated
whenever
the
state
has
been
sued.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
approach
creates
an
unworkable
approach
to
resolving
the
immunity
question.
as
to
our
first
point,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
exist
simply
to
protect
a
state
against
damages
that
must
be
paid
out
of
the
state's
treasury.
it
also
exists
to
protect
the
state's
dignitary
interest
in
not
being
sued
by
private
parties
without
the
state's
consent,
and
it
applies
regardless
of
the
relief
sought.
here,
respondent
seeks
both
damages
and
injunctive
relief
from
the
state.
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
might
be
contractually
obligated
to
pay
the
cost
of
any
judgment
in
this
case
does
not
change
the
fact
that
the
university
has
been
sued
and
legally
will
be
responsible
for
any
judgment.
secondly,
this
case
illustrates
the
problems
created
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
the
department
of
energy
has
not
determined
whether
the
cost
of
any
judgment
in
this
case
would
be
indemnified
under
its
contract.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
the
department
of
energy
must
pay
those
costs
is
merely
advisory
as
to
the
department,
which
is
not
a
party
to
the
case.
a
binding
determination
on
the
indemnity
issue
will
be
made
by
the
department
of
energy's
contracting
officer
after
he
or
she
reviews
the
relevant
facts
in
the
contract.
thus--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
under
the
contract
there's
an
issue
resolution
process,
and
then
it
would
be
appealable
to
the
energy
board
of
contract
appeals
or
the
court
of
federal
claims,
and
then--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
final
rule
has
not
been
issued
yet,
but
the
department
of
energy
hopes
to
have
it
out
in
the
near
future.
it's
just
in
the
form
of
a
notice,
and
they're
assembling
responses
to
the
public
comments.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there's
a
very
significant
change
in
the
third
party
liability
clause.
it
will
now
be...
the
burden
of
proof
will
be
on
the
contractor
to
persuade
the
contracting
officer
that
damages
were
not
caused
by
lack
of
prudent
business
judgment
by
the
contractor's
managerial
personnel.
it's
both
a
widening
of
the
scope
of
the
potential
contractor's
officers
that
can
commit
misconduct
or,
if
you
will,
conduct
that
would
result
in
unallowable
costs,
as
well
as
it's
a
heightening
of
the
standard.
it's
no
longer
wilful
misconduct
or
lack
of
good
faith.
it's
simply
lack
of
prudent
business
judgment,
and
the
department
and
the
university
of
california
are
currently
negotiating
their
contract
to
begin
in
the
fall
of
'97,
so
we'll
know
then
what
that
clause
looks
like.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
other
than
to
assume
that
they
are,
based
on
the
way
the
question
presented
is
worded,
that
if
they're
otherwise
immune,
then
as
a
state
entity
the
department
of
energy's
contractual
obligation
to
indemnify
them
doesn't
change
anything
because
it
is
the
university
who
is
subject
to
the
coercive
enforcement
powers
of
the
court
and
in
any
event
may
turn
around
to
the
department
of
energy
and
the
department
may
not
pay.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
it's
a
fair
characterization
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
what
distinguished
the
university
in
this
situation
was
the
court
of
appeals
view
of
the
department
of
energy's
contractual
obligations,
and
our
position
is
not
to
dispute
any
of
the
factors
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
except
for
what
they
relied
on,
this
payment
factor
that
an
indemnity
allegation
is
solely
a
matter
between
the
university
and
the
department
of
energy.
it
doesn't
affect
the
fact
that
the
university
is
the
party
against
whom
judgment
is
sought.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct,
and
you
have
here
what
certainly
we
did
not
dispute,
was
that
the
state
of
california
is
legally
obligated
to
satisfy
the
university's
debts
based
on
both
the
constitution
and
the
fact
it
appropriates
significant
amounts
of
money
to
the
university
each
year.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
given
those
facts,
if
there's
a
legal
connection,
a
legal
liability
to
the
state
entity
in
question
the
existence
of
an
indemnity
agreement
with
a
third
party
does
not
alter
that
entity's
status
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
that's
again
because
the
university
is
on
the
hook
for
the
judgment
and
that
third
party
may
or
not...
may
or
may
not
be
forthcoming,
and
in
any
event,
that
doesn't
change
the
relationship
between
the
plaintiff,
the
university
as
a
defendant,
and
the
court,
who
can
enforce
the
court's
enforcement
powers
against
the
university.
and
this
case
could...
illustrates
what
could
happen
is,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
the
university
will
have
the
department
of
energy
pay
its
judgment,
the
university
might
find
itself
compelled
to
pay
damages
in
this
case,
yet
ultimately
unable
to
shift
those
costs
to
the
department
of
energy,
and
in
our
view
that
would
be
impermissible
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
again
that's
because
judgment
is
sought
against
a
state
entity.
i
don't
have
any
more
points
to
make,
so
if
there
are
no
questions--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--okay.
[laughter]
