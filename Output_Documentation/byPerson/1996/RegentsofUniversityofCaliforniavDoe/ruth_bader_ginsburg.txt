justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
miller,
was
an
antecedent
to
getting
to
that
in
the
hess
case
that
we
were
dealing
with
an
entity
that
had
not
simply
two
states
as
creators,
but
the
federal
government
as
well,
and
then
said,
there
is
a
presumption
that
such
an
entity
founded
by
three
sovereigns
does
not
wear
the
mantle
of
a
state,
and
maybe
that
presumption
is
undone
if
the
states
are
legally
obligated
to
pick
up
the
tab
for
it,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
in
any
event,
here
there
is
no
legal...
there's
no
release
of
the
university
from
legal
liability.
as
there
was
in
the
hess
case
there
was
no
legal
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
mr.
miller,
in
this
case
you're
saying
that
we
have
to
deal
with
the
university
of
california
as
an
entity
and
not
whatever
livermore
laboratory
might
be
if
it
were
a
discrete
entity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
you
mentioned
with
respect
to
the
department
of
energy's...
what
it
assumes,
what
liabilities
it
will
assume,
that
that
is
now
undergoing
revision.
what
is
the
status
of
the
revision
that
you
described
in
your
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
the
principal
change
from
the
indemnity
as
it
now
exists
and
as
it
will
exist
if
this
rulemaking
is
final?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
ms.
blatt,
does
the
united
states
have
a
position
on
the
question
of
whether
the
university
of...
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california
are
an
arm
of
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
that
was
the
way
the
question
presented
was
worded,
but
the
ninth
circuit
decision
was
more
diffuse,
wasn't
it?
they
said,
this
is
one
of...
they
have
five
factor
tests,
and
we're
reviewing
that
determination,
so
how
could
we
just
pick
out
the
neat
question
presented
and
say
that's
what's
before
us,
when
we're
reviewing
a
ninth
circuit
decision
that
says
there
are
these
five
factors,
add
them
all
up,
and
we
come
out
with
not
an
arm
of
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gayer,
i'd
like
to
know
how
far
your
position
about
a
state
university
goes
with
respect
to
insulating
the
state
against
any
monetary
liability
for
that
piece
of
the
university.
let's
take
an
athletic
department,
where
they
sell
tickets
to
the
games
and
there's
a
big
profit-making
center
for
the
university,
and
a
spectator
at
such
an
event
slips
and
falls,
says
it's
because
the
stairs
were
in
disrepair,
and
sues
the
university
of
california
in
federal
court,
a
diversity
case,
and
the
state
says,
we're
the
state
university.
under
your
theory,
could
the
plaintiff
prevail
by
saying,
not
in
this
instance,
because
we've
got
a
money-making
venture,
and
any
money
that's
going
to
be
paid
will
come
out
of
the
profits
of
that
entity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
just
that
the
state
budget
is
never
going
to
be
touched
because
this
is
such
a
profitable
department
that
it
pays
all
its
own
bills.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
must
admit
it's
rather
peculiar
to
do
what
you
did
in
your
brief.
that
is,
to
take
the
essence
of
what
the
majority
held
from
a
statement
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
rather
unusual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
agree
that,
in
general,
to
find
out
what
the
majority
opinion
says
one
looks
to
the
majority
opinion
rather
than
the
dissent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
majority
did
not
do
that
first.
the
first
thing
the
majority
said
is,
this
is
a
creature
of
three
sovereigns.
one
of
them
is
the
u.s.
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say,
but
you
don't
take
the
dignity
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
so
dignitary
interest
is
one
that's...
that
you
waive.
without
waiving
the...
you
can
sort
of
back
into
waiving
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
a
state
university
is
not
an
arm
of
any
state
if
that
university
has
a
budget
that's
discrete
and
pays
all
its
expenses
out
of
that.
that's
the
end
of
a
state
university
being
an
arm
of
the
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
i
understand
that
the
question
that's
before
us
is,
even
if
the
university
would
otherwise
be
a
state
agency,
it
isn't
when
this
particular
liability
is
covered
in
full
by
a
third
party?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
perhaps
there
would
be
a
problem
of
parties
who
are
not
before
us.
there
must
be
many
state
universities
that
are
patterned
the
same
way,
intended
to
have
a
large
budget
and
to
pay
their
expenses
out
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now,
you
haven't
been
talking
about
control.
you've
been
talking
about
does...
the
university
has
to
operate
out
of
a
special
budget
for
it
with
no
call
on
other
state
funds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gayer,
this
is
the
point,
that
we
review
rulings
that
have
been
made
by
a
court
below.
we
don't
make
rulings
here
in
the
first
place,
and
you
are
asking
us
to
decide
something
as
though
we
were
a...
the
court
getting
this
in
the
first
instance,
and
that
is
not
what
we
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
if
we
are
of
the
view
that
whatever
this
arm
is
or
is
not
should
not
be
affected
by
whether
they've
got
insurance
from
the
government
or
somebody
else
that
covers
this
particular
risk,
this
particular
liability,
as
even
if
we
think
that
we
should
nonetheless
affirm
because
the
ninth
circuit
used
a
five-factor
test
and
we
have
nothing
to
say
about
those
other
factors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
saying
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
ninth
circuit
where
we
would
say,
we
think
you
were
wrong,
we
are
telling
you
you
were
wrong
in
one
particular,
it's
not
relevant
whether
there
was
indemnity
for
this
liability,
what's
relevant
is
who
has
the
legal
liability?
if
we
were
to
say
that,
do
you
think
that
would
be...
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
how
the
ninth
circuit
came
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
a
determination
you're
asking
us
to
make
in
the
first
instance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
asking
us
to
make
that
determination
in
the
first
instance,
because
it
certainly
wasn't
made
by
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
district
court.
