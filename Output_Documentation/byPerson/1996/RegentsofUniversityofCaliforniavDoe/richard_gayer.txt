mr.
richard
gayer
mr.
chief
justice...
excuse
me...
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
federal
case
involving
100
percent
federal
money
at
a
federal
facility,
the
lawrence
livermore
national
laboratory,
which
executes
a
federal
program
for
an
exclusively
federal
interest:
nuclear
weapons
research.
the
regents
here,
regents'
corporation
is
not
managing
a
university.
it's
not
even
running
its
hospital.
what
it's
doing
is
managing
the
lawrence
livermore
national
laboratory
as
a
public
service
to
the
nation,
for
no
loss
or
gain.
that's
on
page
1
of
the
contract,
which
is
not
part
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
richard
gayer
focusing
on
that
narrow
issue,
which
i
personally
believe
that
the
broader
issue
is
subsumed
within
the
question
presented--
mr.
richard
gayer
--focusing
on
the--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well,
i
agree
with
your
honor's
statement
of
the
question
presented
so--
mr.
richard
gayer
--i'd
like
to
focus
on
that.
here
we
have
something
where
the
university
is
really
some
sort
of
facade
or
name
between
the
outside
world
and
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
has
made
a
solemn,
written
promise
to
pay
directly...
not
to
indemnify,
not
to
reimburse,
but
to
pay
directly
any
judgment
awarded
against
the
name
of
the
university.
mr.
richard
gayer
the
problem
is
we
have
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
court
over
the
department
of
energy
until...
ever,
and
we
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
court
over
the
department
of
energy
until
and
unless
such
time
as
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
gets
a
judgment
against
the
name
of
the
university,
so
step
one
is
to
sue
the
university
here
in
u.s.
district
court
and
get
a
judgment.
at
that
point,
we
would
have
a
claim
against--
mr.
richard
gayer
--obviously,
we
contend
that
the
university
is
wrong,
because
there
can
be
no
impact
on
the
state
treasury.
that
was
the
point
of
the--
mr.
richard
gayer
--different
answer.
there,
the
university
paid
for
the
insurance,
therefore
that
has
an
impact
on
the
university's
treasury,
which
happens
to
be
separate
and
distinct
from
the
state
treasury,
but
that's
a
different
situation.
mr.
richard
gayer
yes,
it
is.
mr.
richard
gayer
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
because
here
the
university
is
doing
this
as
a
public
service.
the
contract
says
so.
it's
true
they
get
a
$20
million
annual
fee
for
using
the
name
of
the
university,
but
this
is
not
a
case
where
there's
any
connection
between
this
nominal
fee
and
any
indemnity
or
judgmental
risk.
mr.
richard
gayer
well,
this
calls
for
my--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well,
we
can
only...
your
honor,
we
can
only
speculate
on
that.
mr.
richard
gayer
i
would
speculate
that
the--
[laughter]
i
would
speculate
that
the
university
would
never
sign
such
a
contract.
they
would
tell
the
department
of
energy
to
get
lost.
mr.
richard
gayer
there's
too
much
risk.
it's
not
worth
the
risk.
the
department
of
energy
wants
to
use
the
good
and
prestigious
name
of
the
university
of
california
to
attract
talented
scientists,
technical
professionals
to
work
on
government
projects,
and
the
doe
has
determined
that
it's
to
its
advantage
to
get
a
prestigious
name,
and
the
doe
is
willing
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
richard
gayer
thank
you,
justice
scalia,
yes,
there's
an
important
distinction
here,
i
think,
that
in
general
an
indemnitor
such
as
an
insurance
company
is
quite
separate
from
the
contract,
say,
between
the
government
and
the
regents
corporation.
it
would
be
some
outside
insurance
company
that
would
be
agreeing
to
indemnify.
here,
it's
the
department
of
energy
itself,
for
which
the
regents
is
doing
the
work,
that
is
saying,
you
do
this
work
for
us,
you
run
our
labcratory,
and
we'll
pay
directly
any
judgment,
so
there
is
no
outside
insurers.
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well,
that's
true.
i
assume
that
means
we're
talking
about
something
wherein
perhaps
an
employee
of
the
laboratory
engaged
in
some
sort
of
assault
and
battery,
or
embezzlement,
or
what-have-you,
something
approaching
on
the
criminal,
but
that's
neither
alleged
here,
and
there's
no
hint
of
it
here.
in
the
joint
appendix
near
the
end
at
page...
let's
see
if
i
can
find
this.
i
believe
it's
82a--we
have
a
letter
from
the
department
of
energy
directly
to
the
plaintiff
dated
november
23,
1993,
where
they
make
a
technical
reservation
regarding
justice
o'connor's
mention
of
bad
faith
and
willful
misconduct.
but
if
you
read
this
in
context,
knowing
that
the
event
sued
upon
in
this
case
occurred
in
june
of
1991,
and
this
letter
was
issued
approximately
2-1/2
years
later,
we
have
a
statement
that,
you
know,
while
we
still
reserve
this
business
about
bad
faith,
which
never
occurs,
the
department
is
saying
we'll
bear
the
cost
of
defending
the
university,
and
of
any
monetary
judgment
in
your
favor.
i
submit
there
has
been
no
hint
of
willful
misconduct
or
bad
faith.
it's
not
alleged,
it
didn't
happen,
it's
not
going
to
happen,
and
this
is
something
that
in
any
event
the
solicitor
general
in
its
brief
says
these
exceptions
are
rarely,
if
ever,
applied...
not
to
worry.
i
think
with
regard
to
any
arm
of
the
state
question,
if...
the
regents
corporation
first
of
all
has
never
been
established
as
an
arm
of
the
state
in
any
decision
by
this
court,
and
according
to
the
solicitor
general
the...
this
court
has
never
determined
whether
any
state
university
or
college
is
an
arm
of
the
state
for
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
so
i
don't
think
we
can
just
sort
of
assume
that.
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
did,
it
says,
let's
look
at
the
facts.
we
look
at
the
facts,
and
we
assume
that
a
promise
made
by
the
federal
government
in
writing
is
a
solemn
promise,
that
the
department
of
energy,
when
it
says
it's
going
to
pay
directly,
will
pay
directly.
why
not
assume
that
the
government
is
going
to
act
in
bad
faith?
i
think
that's
a
fair
presumption.
i
think
it
would
unduly
expand
the
immunity
provided
by
the
eleventh
amendment
if
you
could
let
states
structure
entities
as
they
pleased
which
would
be
totally
commercial,
and
for
which
they
would
have
no
risk
at
all
financially,
and
still
give
them
immunity.
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well,
it
depends
on
how
the
entity
is
structured.
i
don't
know
if
this
is
going
beyond
justice
ginsburg's
question,
but
in
this
particular
case
we
assume
the
athletic
endeavor
has
no
contract
with
the
department
of
energy,
and
there's
no
pay
directly
provision
there.
mr.
richard
gayer
oh,
i
think
that's
what
happened
in
hess,
that
initially
the
bi-state
entity
was
receiving
something
like
$100,000
a
year
from
each
state,
but
that
was
years
and
years
ago
and--
mr.
richard
gayer
--but
according
to
the
dissent
in
hess
the
same
test
applies.
mr.
richard
gayer
i
stand
squarely
with
the
entire
decision
in
hess.
mr.
richard
gayer
i'm
trying
to
harmonize--
mr.
richard
gayer
--no,
i'm
trying
to
harmonize--
mr.
richard
gayer
--because
we...
in
our
proposed
test
the
first
thing
you
look
at
is
the
impact
on
the
s-t-a-t-e
treasury.
mr.
richard
gayer
it
sounds
like
a
good
idea,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
gayer
and
that's
why
in
our
proposed
test
we
say
first
you
look
to
the
state
treasury
factor
as
the
majority
did
in
hess.
if
that's
dispositive
of
the
case,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
richard
gayer
in
any
event,
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
the
respondents
do
rely
on
hess,
where
it
said
that
the
twin
reasons
for
being
of
the
eleventh
amendment
are
state
treasury
and
dignity,
and
we
take
the
state
treasury
factor,
very
important
here.
that's
why
we're
here.
if
the
state
treasury
factor
wasn't
here
we
couldn't
argue
about
the
pay
directly
provision.
mr.
richard
gayer
well,
yes,
we
do,
because
here
we
claim
that
the
attorneys
for
the
regents
corporation
in
submitting
for
1
year
to
discovery,
taking
depositions,
submitting
to
depositions,
answering
interrogatories,
responding
to
requests
for
production
of
evidence,
has
diluted
its
dignitary
interest,
has
said,
in
effect--
mr.
richard
gayer
--no.
well,
you
weaken
your
eleventh
amendment
claim
if
you
act
as
though
you
don't
mind
being
coerced
by
the
discovery
power
of
the
court
not--
mr.
richard
gayer
--mr.
chief
justice,
that's
true,
but
here
the
petitioners
cooperated
with
discovery.
they
didn't
say,
we
have
an
eleventh
amendment
dignitary
interest
and
therefore
we're
not
going
to
respond
to
your
discovery
on
the
merits.
they
just
went
along
as
if
it
were
ordinary
litigation.
mr.
richard
gayer
with
due
respect,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
if
a
purported
eleventh
amendment
entity
takes
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
seriously,
especially
its
dignitary
interest,
that
the
first
thing
it
will
do
is
move
to
dismiss
based
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
it
won't
play
around
with
litigation
for
a
year.
the...
it's
also
our
position
that
each
case,
especially
since
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
issue
can
be
raised
sua
sponte
by
any
court
at
any
time,
that
any
time
a
court,
especially
the
supreme
court,
considers
an
eleventh
amendment
case,
it
will
look
at
the
whole
picture,
and
so
whether
or
not,
of
course,
the
university
has
been
held
to
be
an
arm
of
the
state
in
other
contexts
in
other
cases
that
were
not
in
this
court
doesn't
really
matter.
it's
certainly
not
determinative
or
dispositive
or
anything.
i
think
that
each
case,
as
the
ninth
circuit
did,
looks
at
the
facts,
looks
at
the
law
as
presented
by
the
plaintiffs.
in
our
proposed
procedure,
we
suggest
that
the
plaintiff
had
the
burden
of
inducing
facts
and
law
that
shows
that
the
purported...
that
the
state
entity
is
not
a
state
agency,
that
is
to
say,
is
not
an
arm,
therefore
doesn't
deserve
eleventh
amendment
protection.
otherwise,
you
run
the
risk
of
undue
expansion
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
anything
that
says
"of
california"
is
immune,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
justice
ginsburg,
i
was
thinking
of
something
about
insulating
treasuries,
and
in
this
case
the
state
law
of
california
does
insulate
the
state
treasury
from
the
regents.
under
state
of
california
law,
a
judgment
against
the
regents
can
be
executed
only
against
the
treasury
of
the
regents.
there
is
no
claim
against
the
very
separate
and
probably
larger
state
treasury.
that
applies
under
all
circumstances.
so
it's
our
position
that
even
absent
the
pay
directly
provision
in
the
contract,
that
the
state
treasury...
as
opposed
to
the
regents'
treasury,
the
state
treasury
has
no
risk
at
all
in
any
case,
and
that's--
mr.
richard
gayer
--a
state...
a
treasury,
a
treasury
that's
independent
and
wherein
the
university
or
college
has
no
claim
against
the
treasury
of
the
state
itself.
in
other
words,
here,
the
regents'
treasury
has
a
lot
of
money
in
it.
i
think
according
to
a
footnote
in
the
reply
brief
something...
in
one
particular
year,
$10
billion.
now,
in
that
year,
$2.2
billion
came
in
the
form
of
a
block
grant
from
the
state.
the
legislature
made
an
appropriation
to
give
the
money
to
the
regents
to
use
for
any
lawful
purpose.
after
that,
the
state
lets
go.
the
legislature
lets
go,
and
the
regents
must
make
do
with
whatever
money
they
can
get,
and
most
of
their
money
comes
from
outside
the
state,
but
the
point
is
that
a
judgment
creditor
of
the
regents
has
no
claim
against
the
state
treasury,
ever,
and
that's
why
i
think
this
case--
mr.
richard
gayer
--yes.
i
think
we've
addressed
that
fully
in
the
briefs,
and
perhaps
this
morning.
that's
true,
but
i
think
in
order
to
do
a
thorough,
complete,
and
meaningful
job
this
court
might
consider
the
general
question,
otherwise
the
courts
below
are
still
having
to
wonder
about
this
fundamental
issue,
and
one
can
assume
arguendo
so
many
things
that
there's
nothing
left
to
argue
about.
mr.
richard
gayer
my
research,
although
not
complete,
says
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is
no,
that
those
cases
i
have
read...
for
instance,
the
rutledge
case,
rutledge
v.
the
regents
of
the
university
of
arizona,
another
ninth
circuit
case,
held
that
there,
there
is
control
by
the
legislature.
mr.
richard
gayer
well,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
in
the
rutledge
case
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
regents
there
were
very
different,
and
they
were
not
separate
and
independent
and
autonomous,
whereas
in
the
instant
case
the
regents
are
very
separate,
very
independent,
and
very
autonomous
of
any
control
by
the
elected
branches
of
state
government.
mr.
richard
gayer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
says
i
could
have
done
a
better
job
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
richard
gayer
well--
mr.
richard
gayer
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
gayer
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
richard
gayer
i
don't
think
so,
but
your
honor,
to
respond
to
your
question,
i'm
not
an
expert
on
this
court's
rule
14.1,
but
i
believe
that
the
general
question
of
the
regents'
overall
immunity
is
subsumed
within
the
question
presented.
if
i'm
wrong,
i'm
sure
your
honors
will
tell
me.
mr.
richard
gayer
well,
as
i
say,
i'm
here
to
please
the
court--
[laughter]
--and
if
that
doesn't
do
so,
i'll
just
move
on.
i
think
the
point
made
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
conclusion
is
really
important.
certainly
under
its
decision
the
regents
corporation
would
lose
very
little.
they
would
still
retain
all
the
immunity
they
have
in
justice
ginsburg's
athletic
event
question,
and
any...
certainly
anything
related
to
their
universities
which
provide
higher
education.
they...
the
only
thing
they
would
lose,
so
to
speak,
is
immunity
if
they're
sued
in
the
operation
of
the
laboratory,
wherein
the
owner
of
the
laboratory
will
pay
directly
any
judgment.
that's
really
no
loss,
because
it's
not
the
university's
operation.
it's
really
the
department
of
energy's
operation.
it's
their
facilities,
their
building,
their
ground,
everything,
and
so
that
there
is
really
no
impact
at
all.
mr.
richard
gayer
well,
as,
of
course,
it
wasn't
disputed,
it
wasn't
even
mentioned.
there
was
no...
no
argument.
mr.
richard
gayer
unfortunately,
no.
i
was,
shall
we
say...
i
won't
use
the
dirty
word,
but
that
was
an
omission
on
my
part.
mr.
richard
gayer
but
those
cases
are
built,
i
submit,
on
a
foundation
of
sand.
in
those--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well,
the
point
is
there
the
issue
wasn't
fully
litigated,
and
one
of
the
cases,
the
jackson
v.
hayakawa,
the
regents
corporation
was
not
even
a
party.
the
other
cases,
bv
engineering,
armstrong
v.
meyers,
and
the
mascheroni
case
out
of
the
tenth
circuit,
all
those
cases
simply
cited
either
jackson
v.
hayakawa,
where
the--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well,
i...
if
i'm
wrong,
your
honor,
i
apologize,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
is
bound
by
any
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
tenth
circuit,
and
if
they
were
wrong,
they
were
wrong.
they
can't
be
reversed,
i
guess,
without--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well,
that
being
the
case,
your
honor,
then
i
think
the
safest
and
most
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
simply
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
let
us
proceed.
that...
because
that
does
apply
the
five
factor
test.
it's
not
contrary
to
anything
in
hess,
since
it
focused
almost
entirely
on
the
impact
of
the
state
treasury,
and
it
has
minimal
policy
impact
on
the
immunity
generally
of
the
regents
corporation.
mr.
richard
gayer
oh,
sure,
this
court
has
everything
to
say
about
the
other
factors,
but
it's
my
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
the
factors
correctly
and
did
nothing
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
hess
or
any
other
decision
of
this
court.
the
ninth
circuit
properly
distinguished
these
other
opinions,
of
which
i
disapprove,
and
said
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there's
no
possible,
conceivable
impact
on
a
state
treasury,
and
justice
canby
in
his
dissent
got
it
wrong.
he
assumed
something
that
had
not
been
argued
at
all.
neither
side
said
anything
about
who
would
actually
bear
the
burden
of
the
judgment,
and
he
just
assumed
that
the
state
would
do
it.
that
was
incorrect--
mr.
richard
gayer
--and
once
you
assume
that
it's
all
over.
mr.
richard
gayer
if
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor,
it's
my
position
that
since
the
state
of
california
has
no
legal
liability
in
this
case,
that
the
result
would
be
the
same.
now,
i've
also...
i've
been
lectured
by
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
may
not
be
within
the
question
presented,
and
i'll
have
to
accept
that,
but
it's
still
our
position,
as
i
stated,
that
judge
canby
is
wrong
when
he
said
the
state
is
legally
liable.
that's
simply
wrong
as
a
matter
of
california
state
law.
mr.
richard
gayer
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
gayer
yes.
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
because
i
think
that
would
be
the
best
way
to
give
guidance
to
the
courts
below
and
to
attorneys
who
might
bring
a
suit
against
some
purported,
or...
some
purported
arm
of
the
state.
mr.
richard
gayer
it
would
be
very
helpful.
mr.
richard
gayer
but
if--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well--
mr.
richard
gayer
--well,
justice
kennedy,
my
reading
of
state
law
is
that
the
regents
funds
are
not
state
funds
in
that
they're
not
under
the
control
of
the
legislature
or
the
governor
or
any
other
part
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
richard
gayer
and
that
state
entity
is
not
an
arm
of
the
state.
it's
a
separate
and
independent
public
corporation
established
to
manage
the
university
of
california
and
free
to
engage
in
other
businesses,
such
as
running
a
hospital
for
which
it
charges
the
market
rates
for
services,
and
for
managing
the
lawrence
livermore
national
laboratory.
of
course
it's
a
state
entity,
but
it's
very
independent,
and
it's
treasury
is
separate
and
apart
from
the
state
treasury,
and
the
regents
have
no
claims
at
all
to
anything
in
the
state
treasury.
they
get
a
block
grant
from
the
state,
from
the
state
legislature
once
a
year,
and
that's
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
gayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
referring
to
this...
i
don't
mean
to
be...
try
to
inject
too
much
levity,
but
the
foundation
of
sand.
the
foundation
of
sand
starts
here,
because
the
ultimate
foundation
is
the
hamilton
v.
board
of
regents
case
in
293
u.s.,
where
this
court
determined,
based
upon
a
study
of
the
california
constitution
and
statutes,
that
the
university
and
its
regents
were
the
state,
and
in
fact
that
its
orders,
the
orders
of
the
board
of
regents,
were
equivalent
to
state
statutes,
would
be
deemed
the
same
for
purposes
of
that
case.
now,
that
wasn't
an
eleventh
amendment
case,
but
i
do
think
it's
an
important
decision
that
was
built
upon
in
the
decisions
of
the
district
courts
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
that
have
held
repeatedly
that
the
university
is
an
arm
of
the
state.
the
decision
in
the
vaughn
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
a
district
court
case,
is
the
case
in
which
the
factors
were
reviewed
and
then,
in
the
various
ninth
circuit
cases,
vaughn
and
other
cases
subsequent
to
vaughn
were
referred
to
and
relied
upon
as
precedent.
the
fact
that
the
university
is
an
arm
of
the
state
is
now
beyond
serious
debate
as
far
as
the
ninth
circuit's
concerned
as
a
general
proposition,
and
it
ultimately
rests
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
hamilton.
that
leads
me
to
the
next
point,
which
is
the
contention
that
the
university
is
separate
from
the
state
because
the
state
is
not
responsible
for
its
debts.
justice
kennedy,
you
anticipated
our
point
on
this.
the
treasury
of
the
regents
is
very
much
a
state
fund,
and
all
of
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
that
are
given
to
the
regents
in
the
california
constitution
and
statutes
are
designed
to
assure
that
the
regents
would
be
treated
as
a
branch
of
state
government,
albeit
independent
of
political
control,
for
the
very
important
reasons
of
academic
freedom
and
independence
of
education
that
animated
the
founders
of
the
state
back
in
the
middle
19th
century.
notwithstanding
that,
the
constitution
of
california,
article
xvi,
section
8,
provides
a
very
special
provision
for
any
obligations
of
state
universities.
it
states
as
follows,
that
all...
from
all
state
revenues
there
shall
first
be
set
apart
the
moneys
to
be
applied
by
the
state
for
the
support
of
the
public
school
system
and
public
institutions
of
higher
education.
we
referred
to
that
in
our
brief,
and
pointed
out
that
that
gives
in
effect
a
first
charge
on
the
revenues
of
the
state
to
satisfy
the
obligations
of
the
university.
the
manner
in
which
that
is
done
is
the
same
manner
in
which
the
congress
funds
federal
agencies,
by
appropriation,
and
no
doubt
until
the
appropriation
is
made
a
debt
can't
be
paid
if
the
regents
don't
have
otherwise
sufficient
funds,
but
in
the
end,
the
legislature
is
responsible,
by
constitutional
provision,
to
meet
the
obligations
of
the
university,
and
in
that
additional
way
ties
the
university
tightly
to
the
state
of
which
it
is
a
part
and
an
arm,
if
not
a
branch.
i
want
to
make
just
one
other
point,
and
that
is
that
the
relief
in
this
case
seeks
not
only
damages
against
the
university,
but
also
hiring
of
the
plaintiff.
he
calls
it
reinstatement.
he
never
was
instated
in
the
first
place,
so
it's
really
instatement.
one
of
the...
he
asks
for
specific
performance
of
the
alleged
contract,
and
he
asks
that
in
any
event
that
he
be
hired
by
the
university,
or
at
the
very
least
that
his
application
for
employment
be
reconsidered.
each
of
those
forms
of
relief,
if
granted,
would
work--
