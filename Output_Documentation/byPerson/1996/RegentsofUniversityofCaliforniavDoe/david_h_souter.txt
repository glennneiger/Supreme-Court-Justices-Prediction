mr.
miller,
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
i
take
it
that
it's
your
position
that
this
reference
to
a
source
of
indemnity
is
simply
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
there
is
no
circumstance
in
which
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
order
to
determine
the
eleventh
amendment
status
of
some
supposed
arm
of
the
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
assuming
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
raise,
are
you
assuming
in
that
case
that
the
state
treasury
or
"state
funds"
could
never
be
reached,
and
that
the
only
funds
that
could
be
reached
would
be
those
of
the
third
party
nongovernmental
indemnitor?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that...
in
other
words,
that
doesn't
really
qualify,
i
take
it,
your
answer,
because
your
answer
is,
on
the
assumption
that
state
funds
are
reachable
at
least
in
theory,
the
existence
of
a
third
party
indemnitor
is
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law
to
the
eleventh
amendment
determination.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
take
the
position
also,
i
understand,
that
in
making
the
determination
of
the
university's
status
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes
that
the
existence
of
an
indemnification
agreement
as
such
is
simply
an
irrelevant
consideration.
justice
david
h.
souter
given
that
fact,
that's
where
you
stop,
on
your
view.
