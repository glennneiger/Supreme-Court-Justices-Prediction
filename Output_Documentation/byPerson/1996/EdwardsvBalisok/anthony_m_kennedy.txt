justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
minor
point.
he
alleges
at
some
point
that
he's
a
pretrial
detainee,
that
his
conviction
was
overturned.
do
these
good-time
credits
apply
to
some
other
conviction
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--he
says
that
the
conviction
was
overturned,
although
he's
still
in
custody.
i
just
didn't
know
how
that
plays
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
good-time
credits
apply
in
case
he's
convicted
again?
is
that
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
the
oddities
in
this
area
is
that
we
have
the
state
arguing
that
the
prisoner
is
probably
going
to
prevail
in
all
of
these
procedural
matters,
and
in
order
to
establish
a
1983
suit,
the
prisoner
argues
the
contrary.
we've
got
you
switching
positions,
which
makes
me
wonder
if
the
doctrine
isn't
incongruous
at
its
foundation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'll
look
at
heck.
was
that
a
direct
quote
when
you
said
necessarily?
does
heck
use
the
word
necessarily?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
necessarily
vitiate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
surely
we
had
that
same
objection
that
the
chief
justice
is
questioning
when
you're
attacking
the
conviction
itself.
we
said
this
is
very
intrusive
on
state
judicial
mechanisms
for
us
to
second
guess
their
judgment
of
convictions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
yet,
that
seems
to
be
the
very
process
that
you're
holding
out
here
as
the
solution
to
some
of
the
questions
we've
been
raising
in
the
context
of
good
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
because
we've
said
so,
and
we've
said
so
in
order
to
preserve
the
state
from
federal
interference.
and
i
think
what
we're
asking
here
in
exploring
how
we
best
interpret
heck
is
whether
or
not
those
same
state/federal
interests
don't
control.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
were
talking
about
1983
in
the
context
of
the
collateral
attack
on
a
conviction
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
his...
if
he
prevailed
and
had
a
determination,
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
his
rights
had
been
violated
by
the
guards,
would
that
not
have
preclusive
effect
as
to
that
finding
against
the
state
in
a
state
court...
in
a
subsequent
state
court
proceeding?
the
state
is
a
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
in
washington
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
2254
applies
to
federal
court
proceedings,
and
you're
saying
there's
also
a
provision
in
2254
that
says
a
state
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
could
look
at
this
later.
2254,
as
i...
including
(b),
applies
to
the
state...
what
a
state
court
must
do,
and
it
must
first
defer
to
a...
pardon
me...
what
a
federal
court
must
do.
it
must
first
defer
to
the
state
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
has
been
interpreted
to
say
that
the
state
court
need
not
be
bound
by
any
prior
federal
judgment.
