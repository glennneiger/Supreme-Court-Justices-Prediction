justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
explain...
for
a
minute
i
would
appreciate
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
as
i
read
heck...
and
i
was
coming
new
to
it...
and
trying
to
work
out
how
it
would
apply
to
the
mine
run...
maybe
yours
is
or
isn't...
mine
run
kind
of
case
where
a
prisoner
says
there
was
some
procedural
violation
at
my
disciplinary
hearing.
a
mine
run
case.
i
thought
the
problem
in
heck
is
that
1983
normally
requires
no
exhaustion.
patsy.
but
habeas
law
seems
to
require
something
that
looks
like
exhaustion,
and
therefore
you
have
to
reconcile
it.
in
reconciling
them,
i
can
imagine
it
would
make
sense
to
say,
sorry,
1983
requires
no
exhaustion.
that's
the
end
of
it.
or
to
say
it
requires
exhaustion
for
prison
cases
because
of
habeas.
go
exhaust.
but
what
i
can't
understand
is
how
it
could
lead
to
a
hybrid
system
where
you
get
the
worst
of
both
worlds.
you
have
to
keep
running
between
one...
or
you
can
run
between
one
court
and
another,
get
half
your
case
decided
in
federal
court,
then
get
the
other
half
decided
in
state
court.
why
does
that
make
sense
in
terms
of
the
effort
to
reconcile
1983
with
habeas
law?
