john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
add
one
point
to
it?
you
said
inevitably
be
shorter.
do
you
disagree
with
his
argument
that
there
is
a
state
law
doctrine
that
he
may
or
may
not
lose
his
good-time
credits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
same
or
other
evidence.
i
forget
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--some,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
totally
understand
your
answer.
let
me
rephrase
my
question,
if
i
may,--
is
it
correct
that
at
least
in
theory
he
could
win
this
lawsuit
and
say
there
were
federal
violations
of
his
procedural
rights,
rights
of...
violations
of
his
federal
procedural
rights
and
nevertheless
end
up
still
losing
his
good-time
credits?
is
that
a
possibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
not
get
his
good-time
credits
restored.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
possible
or
just
unlikely
in
your
view?
i
mean,
you're
saying
you
don't
think
it
will
happen,
but
your
whole
argument
is
based
on
if
this
could
result,
that's
enough,
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
agree
that
it
will
not
necessarily
result.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
necessarily
would
require
the
restoration
of
his
good-time
credits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
in
order
for
you
to
prevail,
you
would
not
have
to
advocate
the
rule
that
you
do
advocate
in
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
necessarily
true?
isn't
it
at
least
possible
if
he
won
this
case,
you
could
have
another
prison
disciplinary
action
and
follow
all
the
procedures
he
requests
and
come
to
the
same
conclusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
new
trial
that
ended
up
with
exactly
the
same
period
of
incarceration
as
he
got
with
the
unfair
trial.
that
happens
a
lot
in
the
criminal
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it
is
true
that
this
problem
only
arises
if
you
lose
in
the
federal
court.
most
of
these
cases
you're
going
to
win
in
the
federal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
any
comment
on
carey
against
piphus?
