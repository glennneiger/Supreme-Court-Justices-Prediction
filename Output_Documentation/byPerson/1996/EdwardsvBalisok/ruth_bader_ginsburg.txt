justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
mix,
i'm
confused
and
perhaps
you
can
help
me.
it
seems
like
everything
that
you
are
discussing
is
academic
because
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
the
prisoner's
complaint,
he's
not
saying
that
the
conduct,
the
bad
conduct
in
which
he
engaged
in,
isn't
conduct
that's
subject
to
a
good-time
reduction.
what
he's
saying
is
i'm
a
jailhouse
lawyer,
and
i'm
going
to
be
brought
up
on
these
disciplinary
charges,
and
most
of
the
time
they've
got
me.
but
i
want
the
procedure
to
be
fair.
so,
i'm
talking
about
not
giving
me
witness
statements
or
witness
statements
that
aren't
date-stamped.
so,
i'm
not
arguing
that
i'm
ever
entitled
in
any
of
these
proceedings
to
keep
that
good
time.
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
i
was
a
bad
actor
in
prison.
all
i'm
saying
is
i
want
a
procedure
that
isn't
infected
by
these
witness
statements.
and
so,
i
read
his
complaint
and
i
say,
well,
he's
not
talking
about
the
possibility
of
good
time
at
all.
he's
saying
whenever
there's
discipline
in
this
prison,
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
have
a
fair
procedure.
and
i
may,
if
i
did
the
bad
act,
sure,
they
can
take
away
my
good
time.
so,
how
do
we
even
get
to
your
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's
wrong
with
that?
what's
wrong
with
saying
if
a
prison
going
to
have
a
disciplinary
proceeding,
it's
got
to
be
fair?
and
that's
very
basic.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
mr.
balisok
had
gotten
his
disciplinary
sanction,
hadn't
attacked
it,
and
then
brought
a
suit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--suppose
instead
of
this
emerging
in
a
particular
disciplinary
action,
mr.
balisok
had
brought
a
separate
action
in
which
he
said
i've
been
disciplined
before,
i'm
likely
to
be
disciplined
again.
the
procedure
is
unfair,
and
i
want...
i'm
bringing
this
1983
suit
to
get
the
procedure
fixed
so
that
if
and
when
i'm
disciplined
again,
i'll
get
a
fair
procedure.
would
that
be
a
permissible
suit
to
bring
under
1983?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
that
mr.
balisok
could
do
exactly
what
on
the
surface
he
seems
to
want
to
do
which
is
to
get
a
fair
procedure,
disciplinary
procedure,
installed,
and
he
could
do
that
under
1983,
but
he
has
to
pay
a
price.
that
is,
he
has
to
say
even
if
the
good
time
was
taken
away
from
me
in
an
unfair
procedure,
i
am
giving
up
my
right
to
the
equivalent
of
a
new
trial
so
that
i
can
bring
the
1983
action.
that's
what
you're
saying
in
essence,
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
he
must
exhaust.
he
could
bring
it
as
a
1983
action,
but
he
must
say,
i
will
never
seek
restoration
of
those
credits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what
you
are
saying.
he
can...
he's
got
a
1983
suit,
but
he
has
to
say,
i
won't
try
to
get
back
those
good-time
credits
even
though,
if
i
win
the
1983
action,
it
will
be
clear
that
the
procedure
that
was
used
to
discipline
people
in
this
prison
was
unconstitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
he
prefers
the
federal
forum,
he
can
have
it.
there's
nothing
disabling
about
his
claim.
he
can
have
it
in
a
federal
forum,
but
he
has
to
give
up
the
good
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
it's...
he's
saying,
it's
not
inevitable
that
i
will
get
my
good
time,
but
at
least
i'll
have
a
shot
at
it?
i'll
have
a
fairer
shot.
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
to
get
those
good-time
credits,
and
if
i
get
my
fair
procedure,
maybe
i'll
have
a
better
chance,
but
it's
not
inevitable
that
if
i
win
my
procedural
argument,
i'm
going
to
get
the
credits.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
wouldn't
he
have
to
have
something
in
the...
i
thought
his
situation
is,
i've
had
an
unfair
trial,
so
at
least
i
ought
to
get
my
good-time
credits
restored,
and
then
we
can
have
a
fair
disciplinary
proceeding
and
maybe
they'll
be
taken
away
again.
isn't
that
really
what
you're
saying
is
going
on
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
procedural
rights
don't
exist
in
the
air.
they
have
to
be,
as
justice
scalia
just
pointed
out,
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
something.
and
here
it
seems
to
me
what
they're
protecting
is
the
man's
liberty.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just...
that
went
by
me
very
quickly.
i
thought
there
was
something
about
the
supremacy
of
federal
law
that
would
require
a
federal
court
to
honor...
a
state
court
to
honor
a
federal
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
that
a
court
decree
doesn't
count
as
a
federal
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought...
and
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this...
that
it
was
well
accepted
that
essentially
the
federal
court
judgment
gets
the
same
full
faith
and
credit
in
a
state
court
that
a
sister
state...
the
notion
that
a
federal
court
judgment
is
entitled
to
less
respect
in
state
a
than
a
judgment
of
a
sister
state,
state
b
judgment,
that's
very
strange
to
me,
and
i
frankly
don't
think
it's
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the...
but
there
are
other
doctrines
and
one
of
them
is
the
supremacy
of
federal
law.
your
stronger
argument
i
suppose
is
that
you
can
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
judgment
and
still
not
revoke
his
good
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
much
sounder
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
much
sounder
argument
than
to
say
that
a
state
court
doesn't
have
to
give,
in
effect,
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
federal
judgment.
yes.
that's
quite
a
different
point
as
to
whether
or
not
it
must
accept
as
binding
the
fact
that,
say,
the
officer
mislabeled
or
destroyed
or
concealed
the
documents.
