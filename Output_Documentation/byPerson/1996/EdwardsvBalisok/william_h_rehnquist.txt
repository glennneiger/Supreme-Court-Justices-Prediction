chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
95-1352,
gary
edwards
and
tana
wood
v.
jerry
balisok.
ms.
mix,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
has
not
finally
waived
it
or
surrendered
it,
though,
has
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
retrial
on
the
same
charge
that
was
earlier
overturned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
he
been
retried?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why...
wouldn't
the
whole
good-time
calculus
begin
anew
if
he
were
convicted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question
you
present
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
heck
bars
the
1983
action
brought
by
a
prisoner
challenging
prisoner
disciplinary
procedures,
if
the
success
of
that
action
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
prisoner's
loss
of
good
time.
now,
that
was
the
language
used
in
heck
i
believe,
necessarily
imply,
but
that
could
mean...
is
there
a
probability,
a
possibility,
or
a
certainty?
that
really
is
what
we
have
to
decide
here,
what
that
language
in
heck
meant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
ms.
mix,
as
i
understand
it,
relied
on
its
earlier
opinion
in
gotcher
against
wood.
and
am
i
right
in
thinking
in
that
case
they
said
that
an
inmate's
challenge
to
the
procedure
by
which
he
was
denied
good-time
credits
does
not
call
into
question
the
continuing...
the
lawfulness
of
his
continuing
confinement,
in
effect,
saying
that
good-time
credits,
one
way
or
the
other,
do
not
require
any
resort
to
habeas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
mix.
mr.
rice,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
mr.
rice,
that
he
would
get
a
declaration
of
some
sort
in
the
federal
court
that
he
had
been
denied
procedural
rights
in
the
disciplinary
proceeding.
and
then
you
envision
him
going
to
state
court
and
taking
that
declaration
then.
what
does
he
do
in
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
seems
like
a
very
strange
bifurcation.
you
know,
we
like...
we
think
of
things
ordinarily
if
you
can
do
something
in
one
procedure,
you...
and
you
contemplate
i
gather
this
totally
divided
procedure.
half
of
it
takes
place
in
federal
court
and
half
in
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
theory,
mr.
rice,
could
you
go
into
federal
court
and
say
with
respect
to
a
trial
in
which
you
had
been
found
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense
that
you
had
been
denied
the
right
of
counsel
and
that
the
federal
judge
says,
well,
you
know,
that
should
be
in
habeas?
you
say,
well,
no,
i'm
not
trying
to
challenge
my
conviction
here.
i
just
want
nominal
damages
for
being
denied
the
right
to
counsel.
and
then
could
you...
so,
then
the
federal
court
says,
okay,
i
find
you
were
denied
the
right.
can
you
then
take
that
over
to
state
court
and
say,
look,
i've
got
a
finding
that
i
was
denied
counsel,
so
set
my
conviction
aside?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
a
federal
court
make
that
determination
without...
in
a
1983
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
immunity
is
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
rice,
the
difference
in
footnote
7
that
you
appeal
to
is
this.
the
example
given
in
footnote
7
is
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure.
you
have
standing
to
challenge
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure
regardless
of
its
effect
upon
your
conviction.
it
is
a
wrong
in
and
of
itself.
but
you
have
no
standing
to
challenge
the
depravation
of
procedures
unless
you
allege
that
those
procedures
have
affected
or
may
have
affected
the
reduction
of
your
sentence.
the
example
given
in
footnote
7
has
no
relationship
to
the
present
case.
there
was
standing
to
challenge
a
separate
unconstitutional
act,
but
the
unlawful
act
you're
claiming
here
is
an
act
that
you
have
the
ability
to
challenge
only
by
reason
of
your
assertion
that
it
affected
your
sentence.
that's
a
different
situation
entirely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
actually
three
strikes
and
you're
in.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rice.
ms.
mix,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mix.
the
case
is
submitted.
