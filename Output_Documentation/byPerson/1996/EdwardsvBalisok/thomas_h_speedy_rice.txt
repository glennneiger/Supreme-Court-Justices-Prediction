mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
four
important
points
raised
by
this
case.
the
first
one
is,
is
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
and
heck
v.
humphrey
good
law?
and
yes,
it
is.
second,
do
the
heck
principles
apply
to
prison
disciplinary
hearings?
yes,
they
do.
third,
is
it
important
for
our
system
of
justice
that
prisoners
be
permitted
to
file
1983
claims
to
protect
violations
of
procedural
due
process
at
prison
hearings?
yes,
it
is.
and
finally,
does
mr.
balisok's
amended
complaint
state
a
valid
claim
for
a
violation
of
procedure
as
set
out
in
wolff
and
heck?
and
it
does.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
no,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
decision
applied
heck.
what
it
said
was
if
you're
simply
attacking
procedure,
then
the
heck
principle
of
does
it
necessarily
imply
invalidity
doesn't
apply.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
no,
it
does
not.
if
you
look
at
this
court's
decisions
under
like
carey
v.
piphus
or
memphis
school
district
or
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
this
court
has
clearly
said
that
a
depravation
of
a
constitutional
procedure
is
in
itself
a
violation
and
you
have
to
have...
you
have
standing--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--well,
the
procedure
made
a
difference,
your
honor,
because
he
wasn't
allowed
to
call
a
witness
at
a
hearing.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
that's
the
procedure.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
the
difference
is
that
he
wasn't
allowed
to
have
a
witness
at
a
hearing
and
whether
or
not
that--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--he
has
to
say
for
standing
purposes
that
he
had
a
right
to
call
that
and
that
it
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
hearing,
not
that
it
would
have
affected,
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
those
witnesses
there.
those
witnesses
are
a
basic
constitutional
right--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--he
has
to
assert
that
it
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
hearing.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
well,
because
he
can't,
under
1983
and
the
habeas
dichotomy,
your
honor,
because
the
decision
as
to
whether
it
would
have
affected
the
outcome
belongs
in
state
court.
that's
purely
a
state
court
decision
under
habeas.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
in
the
state
of
washington
and
in
most
states,
when
a
prisoner
goes
in
to
attack
habeas,
he
is
going
in
under
a
standard
of,
one,
some
or
any
evidence
that
upholds
the
hearing.
and
in
the
state
of
washington,
in
particular,
they
have
held
that
where
you
allege
a
constitutional
violation
such
as
in
the
case
of
in
re
burton
where
they
were
denied
notice
of
the
hearing,
which
is
one
of
the
fundamental
rights
this
court
guaranteed,
the
state
of
washington
didn't
automatically
reverse
that,
but
said
they
had
to
show
an
actual
and
substantial
prejudice
for
that
constitutional
violation.
that's
different
than
the
standard
under
1983.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
the
grievance
is
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
present
witnesses.
in
fact,
he
was
lied
to
by
the
prison
officials,
and
that,
yes,
had
he
presented
those
witnesses,
it
may
have
made
a
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
hearing.
we
don't
know
that
and
we
don't
know
that
in
1983.
that's
a
decision
for
state
court
to
decide.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
if
the
court
held
that
he
was
denied
constitutional
procedure
under
1983
and
awarded
him
the
injunction
he
seeks
and
nominal
damages,
he
would...
it
would
not
necessarily
imply
any
change
in
the
outcome
of
his
hearing
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
i'm
ultimately
saying
that
this
court
needs
to
determine
under
1983
whether
or
not
proper
prison
procedures
were
followed.
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
in
superintendent
v.
hill,
this
court
said
that
there
are
four
basic,
bottom
line
rights
to
a
fair
hearing
in
prison.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
yes,
the
liberty
interest
and
good-time
credits
and
the
right
to
a
fair
hearing.
that's
what
it's
protecting.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
well,
he
would
go
to
state
court,
if
he
had
the
opportunity
to,
to
go
to
state
court.
he
could
present
that
declaration
from
the
federal
court.
but
the
state
court
doesn't
have
to
honor
it,
and
the
state
court
under
2254
and
habeas
has
the
first
right
of
review
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
facts
presented
make
any
difference
in
the
hearing
result
or
the
outcome
of
the
hearing.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
they're
separate
and
distinct
procedures,
mr.
chief
justice.
they--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--well,
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
well,
an
attack
to
the
conviction
or
the
sentence
imposed
at
the
conviction
by
federal
statute
under
habeas
must
be
done
in
habeas
corpus
and
must
exhaust
state
remedies.
but
an
attack
to
an
illegal--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--well,
your
honor,
they
don't
because,
one,
1983
is
a
different
statute
which
doesn't
require
exhaustion.
this
court
in
patsy,
in
the
case--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--that's
true,
but
in
there...
in
heck
you
also
affirmed
wolff
and
said
an
attack
to
the
procedure
that
doesn't
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
or
the
sentence
is
valid
and
can
go
forward.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
it
doesn't
imply
it,
your
honor,
because
when
he
goes
to
state
court,
when
he
goes
into...
to
the
attack
of
habeas--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--it's
not
automatic.
no,
sir,
it's
not
because
when
he
goes
into
habeas
corpus,
there's
an
entirely
different
standard
the
court
is
looking
at.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
it
may...
it
implies
the
procedures
were--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
well,
your
honor,
this
court
used
footnote
7
in
heck
to
explain
what
it
meant
by
necessarily
imply,
and
in
footnote
7
this
court
said
if
the
attack
on
procedures
had
a
different
doctrine
such
as
inevitable
discovery
or
harmless
error,
then
our
holding
that
the
procedure
was
invalid
doesn't
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
or
sentence
because
of
other
doctrines
which
intersect
on
that
issue.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
your
honor,
you
can
reach
certain
levels
of
constitutional
depravation
that
no
court
would
hold
a
fair
hearing.
now,
in
the
denial
of
counsel,
the
question
becomes,
did
the
person
waive
counsel?
did
they...
were
they
coming
back
later
after
an
improper
waiver?
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
i
think
that
immunities
granted
in
the
judicial
context
would
prohibit
a
federal
court
from
making
that--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--well,
your
honor,
i
go
back
to
this
court's
precedent
in
carey
v.
piphus
and
in
memphis
school
district
where
there
was
a
challenge
to
an
unconstitutional
procedure
which
the
court
said
it
wouldn't
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
hearing.
it
would
not
have
mattered,
and
that
the
challenge
to
a
constitutional
procedure
on
the
right
to
a
fair
hearing...
it
doesn't
entitle
you
to
actual
damages.
it
doesn't
entitle
you
to
any
other
damages
other
than
the
injunction
on
the
hearing
and
nominal
damages
which
you
can
get
and
to
vindicate
that
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
and
it
also
says,
and
of
course,
harmless
error
under
arizona
v.
fulmanente.
so,
it
does
refer
to
all
three,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
well--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--yes,
it
is
enough
for
us
to
prevail.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
that's
correct
because
of
the
state
having
the
some
or
any
evidence
standard,
having
a
substantial
and
actual
injury
for
a
constitutional--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--on
federal
habeas,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
that's
enough
for
us
to
win.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
while
it
seems
convoluted,
your
honor,
it
makes
sense
because
there
is
very
distinct
and
separate
remedies
in
1983
and
in
habeas
corpus.
in
habeas
corpus
all
you
can
get
is
a
reversal
of
the
hearing
or
return
of
your
good
time.
you
cannot
get
an
injunction
to
attack
an
improper
procedure
or
to
try
and
stop
the
conduct
from
occurring
again
and
again
and
again.
1983
allows
you
to
go
in
and
get
a
declaration
and
injunction
to
stop
the
conduct
from
occurring,
and
in
many
ways,
it's
a
more
efficient
remedy
than
habeas
corpus.
so,
the
two
doctrines
are
separate
and
they
operate
separately.
and
this
court
said
in
wolff
and
it
has
said
over
and
again
in
different
cases
like
heck
that
you
could
actually
have
them
both
at
the
same
time
because
they're
addressing
such
different
standards
and
different
matters
of
proof,
and
they're
statutorily
created
by
congress.
now,
to
further
your
answer
your
question
why
you
may
not
have
this
back
and
forth
again
and
the
trouble
you're
concerned
about
is
in
april
of
1980...
1996
congress
passed
the
prisoner
litigation
reform
act.
it
addressed
virtually
all
of
the
questions
that
the
state
is
concerned
about.
first,
you
have
to
exhaust...
when
they
looked
at
exhaustion...
and
congress
looked
at
exhaustion,
they
said
we're
going
to
make
prisoners
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies,
not
judicial
or
court
remedies.
on
the
administrative
remedies,
mr.
balisok
has
done
that.
second,
for
how
the
petition
to
go,
it
said,
if
you're
attacking
conditions
in
the
prison
or
conduct
of
the
guards
affecting
confinement,
you
can
proceed
under
1983.
congress
has
said
that.
if
you're
attacking
the
result
of
the
hearing
or
a
term
of
confinement,
you
have
to
go
to
habeas
corpus.
those
are
the
two
routes
you
have
a
choice
to
do.
they're
separate.
as
for
these
claims
going
forward,
congress
has
said,
you
know,
there
have
been
too
many
of
them,
so
we're
going
to
enact
a
three
strikes
and
you're
out
provision.
three
frivolous
or
malicious
claims,
you're
gone.
we're
going
to
make
prisoners
do
filing
fees.
we're
going
to
make
them
pay
for
that.
so,
we're
going
to
have
prisoners
pay
their
judgment
for
the
attorney
fee.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
well,
three
strikes
and
you're
in.
you're
right,
your
honor.
exactly.
but
congress
has
addressed
all
of
the
concerns
about
the
different
claims.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
mr.
balisok
asked
for
a
declaration
that
the
conduct
of
the
guards
was
unconstitutional.
he
asked
for
an
injunction
to
have
them
stop
that
conduct
in
the
future,
that
if
they
have
statements
in
their
hand...
and
his
allegations
are
that
they
had
the
statements,
and
they
told
him
they
didn't
exist.
his
third
is
for
damages
and
according
to
proof
to
the
court.
now,
after
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
that's
just
nominal
damages.
and
his
fourth
is
a
general
claim
for
any
other
relief
the
court
deems
just
and
equitable.
that's
the
only
claims
of
relief
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
not
really,
your
honor,
and
here's
why.
while
it
may
have...
it
may
say,
all
right,
that
fact
is
determined.
28
u.s.c.
2254
by
federal
statute
grants
to
the
states
the
right
of
independent
review
in
habeas
corpus.
so,
if
the
state
felt
that
its
hands
were
tied
by
that
determination,
it
could
discard
it
or
even
come
to
a
different
interpretation
because
of
what's
granted
to
it
under
2254(b)
which
is
a
right
of
independent
determination.
also,
there's
no
requirement
that
a
federal
judgment
be
given
preclusive
effect
in
state
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
no,
there
is
not,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
the
state
can
look
at
it,
but
the
state
is
not
required
to
adopt
it.
so,
in
that
respect,
the
state
can
come
in
and
look
and
say,
all
right,
we've
got
this
finding
in
federal
court,
and
the
first
thing
it
looks
at
under--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--your
honor,
a
federal
court...
a
state
court
is
required
to
honor
a
sister
court
judgment
under
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
constitution,
and
a
federal
court
must
honor
a
state
court
judgment
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute.
there
is
no
federal
statute
which
requires
a
state
court--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--the
supremacy
clause
would
infer
to
the
state
that
it
should
give
deference
to
the
federal
court
judgment.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
in
terms
of
applying
it
to
2254
which
gives
the
state
the
right
of
independent
review,
that
the
state
court
can
look
separate
from
the
federal
judgment
in
1983.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
well,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
constitution
goes
state
to
state
and
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
governs
both.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
it
would
not
revoke
his
good
time
because
of
the
state
court
rights
under
some
or
any
evidence.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
pardon
me?
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
well,
your
honor,
when
the
decision...
when
the
1983
decision
goes
into
state
court,
the
state
court
has
several
avenues
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
independently.
2254
says
you've
got
a
right
of
first
review.
washington's
law
under
some
or
any
evidence...
and
i
refer
to
the
in
re
burton
where
they
said
not...
any
meager
evidence,
even
inferential
evidence,
is
enough
to
support
the
finding
of
the
disciplinary
board,
and
once
they
find
any
evidence,
the
analysis
stops.
it's
not
a
weighing
decision
between
the
court...
between
is
this
good
evidence
and
this
bad
evidence.
this
court
affirmed
that
rule
in
superintendent
v.
hill
where
it
said
for
prison
disciplinary
hearing
review--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--2254(b)
says
that
a
state
court
has
the
first...
gives
the
states
the
first
right
of
review
on
habeas
grounds.
you
have
to
have
that
exhaustion.
the
state
has
to
have
the
independent
right
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
i
don't--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--right.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
it's
not
a
covert
habeas
action
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
but
it
depends
upon--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--it
has
application
with
regard
to
what
the
state
standard
is
when
it
reviews
a
prisoner
habeas
petition.
that's
where
it
has
application,
and
the
state
standard
on
review
of
a
prisoner
habeas
petition
is
the
right
of
first
and
independent
review.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
that's
right,
and
that
has
been
interpreted--
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
--well,
look...
you
can
look
at
the
language
in
heck
v.
humphrey
where
the
state
there
was
saying
you
have
to
in
heck...
you
can't
allow
this
ruling
to
afford
in
heck
because
it's
going
to
be
preclusion
in
state
court,
and
the
opinion
in
heck
addresses
that
point
and
says,
no,
it's
not
going
to
be
preclusion.
preclusion
may
not
be...
may
not
apply
and
it
may
not
even
be
permissible.
and
it
sets
out
in
footnote
11
i
believe
why
that's
so
because
2254
is
federal
statute
and
the
preclusion
is
judge-made
law,
court-made
law.
so,
2254
governs
over
court-made
law
when
you
weigh
the
two,
and
2254
will
give
the
independent
review
to
the
state.
so,
if
you
look
at
heck
in
footnote
11,
that's
fully
explained
by
this
court
why
preclusion
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
balisok
is
simply
asking
for
a
right
to
review
an
unconstitutional
procedure.
prisoners
in
the
united
states
have
really
just
four
when
it
comes
to
fair
hearings:
a
right
to
notice,
a
right
to
time
to
prepare,
a
right
to
present
witnesses
so
long
as
it
doesn't
interfere
with
prison
discipline
or
administration,
and
a
written
finding
of
fact.
there's
only
four
things
that
are
given
to
prisoners.
he's
simply
asking
in
this
case
that
these
guards
who
had
witness
statements
that
he
had
asked
for,
who
deliberately
told
them
they
didn't
exist,
that
didn't
date-stamp
them
so
that
he
couldn't
prove
they
existed
at
the
time,
but
were
later
found
in
his
file...
that
he
have
the
right
to
have
a
ruling
under
1983
that
that
conduct
is
unfair
and
it's
unconstitutional
and
it
shouldn't
be
permitted.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
footnote
9.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
speedy
rice
look
at
footnote
9
where
this
court
says,
while
we
have
no
occasion
to
rule
on
the
matter
at
this
time,
it
is
at
least
plain
preclusion
will
not
necessarily
be
an
automatic
or
even
permissible
effect.
and
then
in
the
explanation
of
that
it
says,
the
court-made
preclusion
rules
may,
as
judicial
application
of
categorical
mandate
of
section
1983
may
not,
take
account
of
the
policy
embodied
in
section
2254(b)'s
exhaustion
requirement
that
state
courts
be
given
the
first
opportunity
to
review
constitutional
claims
bearing
upon
state
prisoner
release
from
custody.
so,
that's
where
you
get
the
dichotomy
on
the
case
where
1983
deals
with
procedure,
an
unconstitutional
procedure.
but
we
are
not
asking
for
return
of
his
good
time.
we're
not
asking
for
reversal
of
the
hearing.
we're
saying
this
was
a
hearing
involving
good
time,
which
is
a
liberty
interest.
this
court
has
said
that
good
time
still
remains
that.
and
second,
when
you've
got
a
liberty
interest
at
stake,
you're
entitled
to
a
minimum
of
due
process
for
a
fair
hearing.
and
that's
all
we're
in
court
asking
for
this...
for
mr.
balisok
to
have
is
his
hearing...
is
a
right
to
a
fair
hearing.
thank
you.
