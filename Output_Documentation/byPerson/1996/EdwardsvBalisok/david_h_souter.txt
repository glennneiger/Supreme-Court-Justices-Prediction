justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
and
are
you
taking
the
position
now
that
if
he
succeeds
here
and
then
ultimately
does
challenge
his
confinement
on
habe
that
you're
not
going
to
claim
harmless
error?
are
you
taking
that
position
right
now?
there's
no
harmless
error
doctrine?
justice
david
h.
souter
some
due
process
claims
would
be
subject
to
harmless
error,
but
this
would
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
peculiar
about
this
that
disentitles
it
to
a
harmless
error
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
there's
nothing
inevitable
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you've
just
said...
excuse
me.
have
you
not
just
said
in
answer
to
justice
scalia
that
we
in
fact
cannot
tell
at
this
stage
whether
this
is
one
of
those
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
know
what
the
witnesses
are
going
to
say.
you
know,
for
example,
that
his
hypothetical
cannot
be
true
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't...
isn't
it
the
case...
and
i
don't
want
to
go
on
too
much
longer
with
this,
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
based
on
the
allegations,
you
simply
cannot
tell
in
this
case
whether
the...
whether
his
success
at
this
stage
will
inevitably
result
in
an
entitlement
to
reduced
time.
you
cannot
tell.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
what...
you're
equating
the
outcome
of
the
hearing
with
an
eventual
order
of
release,
aren't
you?
he
may
very
well
say
not
only
that
it
may
have,
but
it
did
affect
the
outcome
of
the
hearing.
but
for
that
error,
i
would
not
have
been...
i
would
not
have
had
my
good
time
subtracted,
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
he
is
necessarily
entitled
to
have
the
good
time
restored
and
the
period
of
his
incarceration
shortened.
isn't
that
the
distinction
that
you
want
to
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
enough
for
your
case,
mr.
rice,
to
admit
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
some
procedural
depravations
that
simply
couldn't
be
cured?
i
don't
know
whether
that's
so
in
this
context,
but
let's
assume
that
it's
a
possibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
then
simply
say,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
claim
that
this
is
one
of
them.
and
as
long
as
there
would
have
to
be
a
further
step
before
any
ultimate
determination
that
the
sentence
should
be...
of
any
ultimate
determination
that
the
sentence
be
shortened,
so
long
as
there
would
have
to
be
a
further
step,
whether
it
be
a
harmless
error
step
or
the
application
of
this
some
evidence
doctrine,
whatever,
as
long
as
there
would
have
to
be
a
further
step,
then
you
don't
have
the
inevitability
that
our
prior
case,
that
heck
and
humphrey,
spoke
of.
isn't
that
enough
for
you
to
prevail?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
is
that
something
different
from
what
i
understood
a
moment
ago
you
to
be
arguing
which
was
there's
a
further
step
simply
because
there
would
be
no
collateral
estoppel
or
no
res
judicata
effect
in
a
state
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
wouldn't
your
argument
be
exactly
the
same
if,
let's
say,
suddenly
tomorrow
morning
you
could
show
that
a
return
to
the
state
court
would
be
futile?
you
would
still
have
to
prove
more
than
just
a
procedural
violation
before
you
would
be
entitled
to
any
ultimate
relief,
let's
say,
on
federal
habe.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
that's
enough
for
you
to
win...
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
that's
enough
for
you
to
win
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
the
whole
assumption
of
the
1983
action
is
that
it
is
not
functionally
equivalent
to
habeas.
so,
i
don't
see
why
that
would
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the...
2254
is
applying
habeas
versus
habeas,
state
versus
federal.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
whole
premise
of
our
argument
is
that
the
1983
action
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
covert
habeas
action
under
certain
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so,
therefore,
2254
doesn't
have
any
application
one
way
or
the
other,
does
it?
