justice

but
what
if
those
witness
statements
are
brought
in
and
it
turns
out
they're
really
not
very
relevant
at
all?
you'd
still
say
no
harmless
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mix,
this
is
bait
and
switch.
we
just
decided
heck
a
couple
of
years
ago.
we
would
not
have
taken
this
case
in
order
to
decide
whether
we
should
reconsider
a
case
just
decided.
the
question
you
presented
in
your
petition
was,
does
this
court's
ruling
in
heck
bar
a
1983
action
that
would...
that
would...
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
prisoner's
loss
of
good
time?
that's
how
you
put
the
question,
and
i
assumed
we
were
going
to
have
a
case
before
us
where
it
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
what
heck
seemed
to
say
very
clearly,
that
where
it...
not
seemed
to
say...
said
very
clearly...
that
where
it
would
necessarily
imply
invalidity
or
shortening
of
the
sentence,
you
have
to
do
it
by
habeas.
now
you
come
before
us
with
a
totally
different
proposition
that
heck
is
inadequate
to
the
real
world
and
we
should
adopt
some
new
proposition.
i
mean,
that
may
be
a
nice
argument,
but
i
resent
being
forced
to
confront
that
argument
when
it's
not
what
i
thought
we
were
taking
the
case
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
issue
was
whether
good-time
credits
comes
within
heck.
that
is
simply
whether
eliminating
a
good-time
credit
is
part
of
necessarily
shortening
the
sentence.
that's
what
i
thought
the
issue
we
were
going
to
grapple
with
was.
but,
gee,
very
little
of
the
debate...
in
fact,
i
think
none
of
the
debate...
goes
to
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
would
do
some
good
just
to
decide
that
point,
right,
even
if
we
don't
reconsider
heck
and
adopt
a
much
more
expansive
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe
some
day
we'll
agree
to
consider
those
difficulties,
but
i
didn't
think
we
had
agreed
to
consider
them
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
their
position
is
that
just
challenging
the
procedures
never
calls
into
question
the
good
time.
isn't
that
right?
even
if
they
gave
him
no
hearing
at
all
and
the
most...
even
in
a
case
where
it's
clear--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
there
is...
that
there
was
harmful
error,
the
ninth
circuit
would
say
good-time
credits
just
don't
count
for
purposes
of
heck.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
take
the
other
extreme.
you
say
even
when
there...
even
when
the
error
is
harmless,
good-time
credits
do
count
for
purposes
of
heck.
and
maybe
you're
both
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
any
discretion
under
section
1983.
i
mean,
some
of
us
think
we
have
discretion
under
habeas
corpus,
but
we
certainly
don't
have
any
under
1983.
i
understood
heck
to
say
that
only
by
reason
of
a
clear
congressional
policy
that
there
should
be
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
before
habeas
corpus
occurs.
we
could
read
the
other
federal
statute,
that
federal
statute,
to
impose
a
statutory
limitation
upon
1983
that
where
the
1983
action
necessarily
boils
down
to
habeas
corpus,
to
the
same
thing,
you
should
require
exhaustion.
but
you're
asking
us
to
go
much
further
in
order
to
pursue
a
policy
that
may
well
be
a
desirable
policy,
but
i
don't
know
how
we
have
the
discretion
to
read
1983
which
is
categorical
on
its
face.
what
statute
do
you
appeal
to
that
modifies
1983
to
such
a
degree
that
even
where
it
does
not
boil
down
necessarily
to
the
same
thing
as
habeas
corpus,
we
may
require
exhaustion?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
acknowledged
that
it
does
not
necessarily
call
into
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
confinement.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
next
natural
step
is
another
federal
statute,
going
beyond
the
statute
that
enabled
us
to
go
as
far
as
we
did
in
heck.
justice
antonin
scalia
number
two
was
not
agreed
to
by
the
decision
below,
though,
was
it?
i
mean,
the
unreported
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
indicate
that
all
challenges
to
prison
procedures
are
exempt
from
heck.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
take
the
opposite
side
of
the
side
i
was
taking
with
ms.
mix.
is
it
possible
just
to
attack
procedure?
isn't
any...
in
at
least
any
attack
looking
retrospectively
to
a
procedure
that
has
already
occurred,
as
opposed
to
a
suit
enjoining
future
use
of
that
procedure,
doesn't
any
such
suit
necessarily
involve
a
challenge
to
the
elimination
of
good-time
credits?
otherwise,
you
have
no
standing.
you
can't
come
in
and
just
complain
that
somebody
in
the
past
committed
a
procedure
that
was
wrong
but
that
didn't
hurt
you
in
any
respect.
isn't...
at
least
as
far
as
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
is
concerned,
doesn't
a
challenge
to
the
denial
of
past
good-time
credits
because
of
invalid
procedure
always
necessarily
involve
a
claim
that
you
should
get
good-time
credits
restored?
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
never
said
that.
even
where
you
acknowledge
that
the
procedure
made
no
difference
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
procedure.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
difference?
the
difference
is
he
was
denied
good-time
credits
that
he
should
have
been
allowed.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
does
not
have
to
go
ahead
and
say,
in
order
to
have
standing,
and
that
made
a
difference
in
the
outcome.
he
doesn't
have
to
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
does
not
have
to
assert
that
it
affected
the
outcome
of
the
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
that
it
may
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
is
never
denied
due
process.
one
is
denied
something
without
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
process
itself
is
worthless.
something
has
been
taken
away
from
you
without
the
process
that
either
the
constitution
or
a
statute
requires,
and
that
is
your
grievance.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
grievance
in
every
one
of
these
prisoner
actions
is
i
have
wrongly
been
denied
good-time
credit,
and
that
is
necessarily
an
assertion
that
i
should
get
out
earlier
than
they're
going
to
let
me
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
this
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
sentence
if
you
consider
as
the
sentence
the
increase
by
reason
of
the
denial
of
his
good-time
credits?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
denial
of
good-time
credits
is
invalid.
if
you
want
to
deny
good-time
credits,
you
have
to
go
through
the
whole
thing
again
with
a
new
procedure,
but
the
past
denial
is
automatically
invalid
once
you
decide
the
procedure
was
wrong.
isn't
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
no,
no.
i'm
just
talking
about
he
comes
and
challenges
under
1983
the
procedures.
the
procedures
are
found
to
be
improper.
okay?
does
that
not
mean
that
the
thing
has
to
be
done
again
and
that
the
prior
denial
of
good-time
credits
is
invalidated?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
even
imply
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
careful,
because
what
it
says,
whether
a
judgment
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
his
conviction
or
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
see
how
it's
possible
to
say
that
when
you
prevail
under
1983
on
the
ground
that
the
procedures
were
wrong,
that
does
not
imply
that
the
denial
of
good-time
credits
was
in
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
significant
that
footnote
7
does
not
refer
to
harmless
error.
it
says
that
there
are
other
doctrines
such
as
independent
source
and
inevitable
discovery.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rice,
what
was
the
relief
asked
for
in
this
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rice,
i've
been
looking
for
footnote
11
in
heck
v.
humphrey.
i
don't--
--it
ends
with
footnote
10.
yes.
is
that
the
footnote
that
we
thought
better
of
and
didn't
issue?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
