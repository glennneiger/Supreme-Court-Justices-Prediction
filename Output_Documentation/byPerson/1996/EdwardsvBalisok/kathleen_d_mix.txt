ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
issues
at
the
intersection
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
in
his
civil
rights
complaint,
mr.
balisok
seeks
relief
from
harm
stemming
from
allegedly
unconstitutional
procedures
at
a
prison
disciplinary
hearing.
although
the
liberty
interest
that
has
given
rise
to
these
procedural
protections
is
the
loss
of
good-time
credits,
mr.
balisok
does
not
seek
restoration
of
those
good-time
credits
in
this
action
and
reserves
that
claim
for
a
later
time.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
mr.
balisok
has
specifically
reserved
his
right
to
contest
and
litigate
over
the
loss
of
good-time
credits
at
a
later
time.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
no.
they
would
still
apply
to
that
conviction.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
yes.
i
think
he
was
still
in
custody
pending
recharging
on
the
same
situation.
so,
he
was
still
subject
to
a
good-time
credit
application
and
denial
process
while
incarcerated.
so,
it
made
no
difference
in
his--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--yes,
they
would
still
be
applying
to
his
total
term
of
confinement.
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
i
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
i
believe
so,
yes.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
i
think
the
good-time
calculus
would
be
made
on
his
total
time
of
confinement,
if
i
understand
the
system
right.
so,
he's
receiving
credit
for
time
served
while
he's
in
a
pretrial
detention
status
and
the
good
time
is
going
to
be
calculated
on
the
whole
of
his
sentence.
as
a
result
of
the
allegations
of
this
complaint,
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
certain
prisoner
cases
which
purport
to
be
about
due
process
procedures
but
which
may
inevitably
or
logically
entail
a
shorter
duration
of
confinement
should
proceed
as
habeas
corpus
actions
with
the
attendant
exhaustion
of--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--i'm
not
sure
precisely
which
doctrine
you're
referring
to.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
the
some
evidence
standard?
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
it
is
correct
that
if
there
was
a
lack
of
some
evidence
in
the
hearing,
that
our
position
would
be
that
his
good
time
could
not
stand,
that
the
hearing
should
be
reversed.
but
we
do
not
agree
with
mr.
balisok
that
that
is
the
only
basis
upon
which
the
hearing
sanction
could
be
reversed.
if
you
take
his
position
as
expressed,
that
the
some
evidence
standard
is
the
only
basis
to
reverse
a
hearing
sanction,
then
it
renders
the
rest
of
the
rule
protections
meaningless.
you
could
have
serious
due
process
violations
and
under
the
theory
advanced
by
mr.
balisok,
those
serious
due
process
violations
could
not
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
sanction
imposed
in
the
disciplinary
hearing.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
that
he
could
win
this
particular
suit--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--our
position
is
that
that
is
not
what
would
occur,
that
if
he
were
to--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--we
believe
that
the
allegations
that
mr.
balisok
has
made
necessarily
invalidate
the
sanction
of
his...
imposed
in
his
hearing,
that
they
are
so
serious.
they
go
to
the
fundamental--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--yes,
under
the
heck
test.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
with
respect
to
the
claims
that
he
is
asserting
in
this
complaint
that
they
are
serious
enough
that
a
harmless
error
doctrine
would
not
be
brought
to
bear
on
these
claims,
but
i--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--that
is
correct.
that
is--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--the
nature
of
the
allegations
made
by
mr.
balisok
are
the
arbitrary
denial
of
witness
statements
that
go
to
his
fundamental
ability
to
prove
his
innocence
and
put
forth
a
case
and
prove
his
innocence
before
the
disciplinary
hearing.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
no.
at
that
point
i
think
a
district
court
looking
at
that
or
a
state
court
in
habeas
corpus,
could
conclude
that
there
was
harmless
error.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
but
just
looking
at
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
as
stated,
our
position
is
that
some
due
process
violation,
some
allegations
that
alleged
serious
deviations
from
the
rule
of
standards,
will
inevitably
lead
to
the
restoration
of
good
time.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
we
think
this
is
one
of
those
cases,
but
the
state
of
washington--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--no.
you
don't
know
that.
you
have
to
look
at
just
the
bare,
naked
allegations
of
the
complaint
to
make
that
determination.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
well,
we
have
not
wanted
to
concede
that
point
in
this
case
because--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--we
think
they
are
so
serious.
but
i
think
it
is
true
in
the
prison
disciplinary
context,
unlike
the
criminal
arena
that
the
court
analyzed
in
heck,
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
say
certain
allegations
inevitably
will
affect
the
outcome
because
of
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
doctrine
in
prison
disciplinary
hearings
and
because--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--yes.
we
realize
that
we
were
elevating
mr.
balisok's
claims
to
a
certain
degree
by
our
position.
but
i
think
the
problem
is
that,
as
i
said,
the
prison
disciplinary
context
is
a
more
fact-bound
determination
and
you
do
not
have
the
same
principles
to
apply
in
that
context
that
you
have
in
the
criminal
arena.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
yes,
and
that
certainly
is
the
language
in
heck,
and
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
problem
you
have
in
a
prison
disciplinary
case,
in
a
case
like
balisok,
is
that
if
we
can't
conclude
that
there
is
a
100
percent
chance
that
the
sanction
is
going
to
be
reversed,
then
the
lower
courts
are
saying
that
doesn't
meet
that
language
in
heck
that
says
necessarily
invalidate.
and
so,
he
can
have
his
case
one
degree
removed.
it
can
be
very,
very
serious
allegations.
yet,
the
court
can't
say
with
100
percent
certainty
that
this
is
a
case
that
will
necessarily
invalidate
the
sanction
and
that
case
will
go
forward
in
1983.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
we
are
proposing
that
the
court
adopt
what
we
refer
to
as
a
bright
line
rule
to
address
a
broader
context
of
cases,
particularly
prison
disciplinary
cases.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
yes.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
yes.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
change
the
holding
in
heck,
and
certainly,
as
mr.
balisok
has
suggested,
we
are
not
asking
for
a
reversal
of
heck.
but
we
do
think
that
the
court
needs
to
clarify
language
in
heck
and
language
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
well,
justice
scalia,
what
we
have
done
is
we
have
argued
that
heck
is
applicable
to
a
category
of
cases
in
the
prison
disciplinary
context
and
that
it
does
fit
squarely
into
that
context,
that
the
lower
courts
are
doing
that.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
whichever
route
the
court
goes
with
this
case,
it
is
very
important
to
say
that
heck
explicitly
applies
in
the
prison
disciplinary
context
and
that
good-time
credits
are,
as
the
courts
have
consistently
found,
within
the
definition
of
fact
and
duration
of
confinement--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--it
would
do
some
good
to
address
that
point,
but
there
will
continue
to
be
difficulties
just
under
that
rule
because
the
courts,
such
as
the
ninth
circuit,
can
take
a
very
serious--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--what
i'm
saying,
though,
is
even
if
you
make
explicit
that
heck
applies
to
the
prison
disciplinary
context,
if
the
lower
courts
are
going
to
say,
but
nothing
fits
within
the
necessary
invalidation
rule
of
heck,
the
rigors
of
the
heck
test,
then
we
haven't
achieved
very
much.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
that
is
how
mr.
balisok
has
presented
his
complaint
certainly
and
how
he
would
like
his
complaint
to
be
read,
but
we
have
to
remember
a
couple
of
things.
one
is
that
he
has
specifically
reserved
his
right
to
go
challenge
his
good
time
later,
and
by
allowing
him
to
proceed
with
just
a
procedures
challenge,
to
rectify
the
procedures
that
you
have
described,
what
we
do
in
that
case
is
we
put
the
procedural
interest
ahead
of
the
substantive
interest.
we
allow--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--because
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
procedural
due
process
exists
in
the
first
instance
to
protect
against
the
mistaken
and
unjustified
depravation
of
liberty.
and
the
vindication
of
those
procedural
rights
should
not
be
at
the
expense
of
the
substantive
interest
that
they
are
there
to
protect.
and
in
this
situation
what
will
happen
is
he
will
get
his
procedural
victory
in
his
1983
action,
and
then
he
will
take
that
procedural
victory
back
to
the
washington
state
courts
and
use
it
to
bolster
or
demand
relief
on
his
loss
of
good
time
on
his
substantive
claims.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
that
is
correct,
but
i
would
characterize
that,
justice
stevens,
as
comparable
to
a
new
trial,
a
new
hearing,
where
the
relief--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--but
the
remedy
that
is
given,
the
rehearing
or
the
retrial,
should
be
given
by
a
court
sitting
in
habeas
corpus,
not
by
a
1983
court.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
their
conclusion
is
that
simply
challenging
the
procedures
doesn't
call
into
question
the
good
time.
i
don't
think
they're
saying
that
the
good
time
isn't...
or
that
heck
isn't...
doesn't
apply
to
a
situation
where
good
time
is
at
issue.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
i
think--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--i
suppose
that's
possible.
this
is
a
question
that
has
many
answers
to
it.
but
i
think
that
the
problem
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
and
what
we
have
seen
other
circuit
courts
doing
is
they're
relying
on
the
language
in
wolff
and
they're
relying
on
the
language
in
heck
that
says
a
procedures-only
challenge
that
does
not
necessarily
vitiate
the
good
time
can
go
forward.
yet,
there
are
a
large
category
of
cases
where
the
good
time
is
called
into
question
and
where,
although
it
might
not
necessarily
be
taken
away,
when
the
court
looks
at
the
issue,
it
may
not
reach
a
harmless
error
conclusion,
but
it
still
may
reach
a
conclusion
that
that
good
time
should
be
restored.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
heck
uses
the
term
i
think
in
relation
to
the
wolff--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--passage,
necessarily
vitiate.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--yes,
i
believe
it
would
be
because
he
would
not
be
under...
suffering
from
any
sanction
that
affected
the
fact
and
duration
of
confinement
sufficient
to
put
it
into
habeas.
it
is
an
anticipatory
action.
now,
whether
he
would
have
standing
would
be
another
question.
but
we
think
there
are
two
types
os
suits
that
could
go
forward
as
you
have
described,
justice
ginsburg.
one
would
be
that
purely
anticipatory
suit,
assuming
he
can
establish
standing,
and
the
other
way
the
inmate
can
get
around
this
issue
is
he
can
concede
that
the
result
is
right.
if
it
is
the
procedural
interest
that
the
inmate
wants
to
vindicate,
if
he
wants
the
procedures
corrected
and
not
done
in
a
certain
way
in
the
future,
let
him
make
good
on
that
and
enter
into
some
sort
of
binding
concession
that
says
i
am
not
challenging
the
result
of
this
hearing.
right
now
these
rules
out
of
wolff
and
out
of
heck
don't
provide
for
that.
so,
we
can
have
a
situation
like
balisok's
where
he
has
specifically
reserved
that
right
and
he
may
go
forward
on
that
claim
for
the
good
time
later
armed
with
a
victory
in
1983.
and
what
that
does
in
a
case
like
this
is
it
deprives
the
state
court
of
the
first
opportunity
to
look
at
claims
and
issues
that
affect
the
fact
and
duration
of
confinement.
and
this
court
has
specifically
said
that
should
not
occur
under
principles
of
comity.
so,
we
are
very
concerned
that
that
will
be
the
result
unless
some
boundaries
are
drawn
around
the
language
in
wolff
and
in
heck.
what
we
will
end
up
with
in
that
situation,
if
he
is
allowed
to
go
forward
in
83
and
then
goes
back
to
state
court,
is
the
potential...
flat-out
potential...
for
conflicting
results
between
these
two
courts.
and
the
public
good
should...
and
the
discretion
of
the
court
should
be
exercised
in
recognition
that
the
public
good
does
not--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--justice
scalia,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
when
a
prisoner
is
challenging
procedures
where
the
challenge
to
that
procedure
logically
will
affect
and
call
into
question,
the
very
language
the
court
used
into...
in
heck,
the
confinement,
then
that
is
a
case
that
involves
the
fact
and
duration
of
confinement,
and
it
should
proceed
first
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
it's
not
imposing
an
exhaustion
request.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
we--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--granted
that
can
be
the
case
in
many
prisoner
cases,
but
i
think
what
we
need
to
do
is
look
at
what
is
the
next
natural
step
after
heck
in
dealing
with
claims
that
call
into
question
confinement,
effect
of
duration,
confinement--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--justice
scalia,
i
disagree.
i
think
that
the
court
has
struggled
for
years
in
trying
to
deal
with
the
intersection
between
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
and
the
lower
courts
continue
to
express
confusion
on
how
to
apply
these
two
statutes.
and
it
doesn't
take
a
congressional
action
to
address
this
issue.
it
takes
this
court
to
give
some
more
rules
in
this
area
as
to
how
these
two
statutes--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--he
has
an
alternative.
he
can
either
concede
that--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--his
alternative
to
conceding
that
result
is
go...
to
go
first
into
state
court
and
attempt
to
have
the
state
court
look
at
the
substantive
liberty
interest
that
is
at
issue.
those
are
expedited
proceedings.
those
are
excellent
proceedings
by
which
he
can
quickly--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--that
is
correct,
but
i
think
he
still
has
other
avenues
back
into
the
federal
forum
should
he
choose
the
exhaustion
route
first,
and
even
if
he
should
not
prevail
in
that
and
be
subject
to
a
harmless
error
situation
under
the
rule
that
we
have
proposed,
the
broader
rule
that
we
have
proposed,
he
could
then
go
forward
with
a
nominal
damages
claim,
another...
other
carey-type
claims
because
he
would
not
be
foreclosed
on
that.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
even
if
there
is
no
preclusion
with
respect
to
the
successful
1983
action,
i
think
the
primary
concern
that
the
state
has
is
that
the
state
interests
and
comity
interests
are
not
served
by
the
state
having
a
second
independent
opportunity
to
look
at
this
claim.
and
the
problem
that
we
have
with
what
has
been
described
here
is
exactly
the
situation
of
running
between
the
courts
where
mr.
balisok
says,
well,
yes,
indeed
he
will
go
back
to
state
court
and
present
this
declaration
to
the
state
court,
this
declaration
of
a
federal
court,
that
there
have
been
procedural
violations
of
constitutional
magnitude
at
this
hearing.
and
the
state
court
is
in
the
position
at
that
point
of
either
rendering
an
inconsistent
result
with
a
federal
district
court
that
has
looked
at
the
same
issue
or
the
state
courts
and
state
officials
are
in
the
position
of
being
persuaded
by
that--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--if
he
win...
if--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--yes,
if
he
wins
in
a
federal
court,
we'll
have
that
problem,
and
that
is
the
precise
situation
that
leads
to
conflict
among
the
courts
that
this
court
has
said
should
not
be
allowed
to
occur.
and
the
situation
gets
even
worse
because
if
mr.
balisok
then
wins
in
his
state
habeas
corpus
petition,
he
has
yet
another
avenue
back
into
federal
court
for
the
actual
harm
from
the
confinement.
so,
we
have
multiple
times
into
the
courts
and
multiple
avenues
into
federal
courts
when
we
bifurcate
these
actions
and
allow
a
1983
procedures-only
claim
to
proceed
as
described
by
mr.
balisok.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
address
is
just
a
question
of
whether
the
procedures
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
liberty,
and
we
think
very
much
that
they
are.
the
second
part
of
the
heck
holding
is
very
critical
with
respect
to
our
rule.
heck
not
only
barred
damages
for
unlawful
confinement,
but
it
also
barred
claims
for
harm
caused
by
unlawful
actions
that
rendered
confinement
invalid.
and
if
the--
ms.
kathleen
d.
mix
--under
the
rules
we
have
proposed,
carey
could
remain
a
good
rule
in
that
it
would
allow
nominal
damages
for
the
violation
of
procedural
rights
but
only
after
there
had
been
exhaustion
of
remedies
through
the
habeas
corpus
procedures.
so,
if
there
is
a
finding
of
error
but
it's
harmless
error,
that
procedural
right
could
still
go
forward
for
a
nominal
damages
claim
under
carey.
