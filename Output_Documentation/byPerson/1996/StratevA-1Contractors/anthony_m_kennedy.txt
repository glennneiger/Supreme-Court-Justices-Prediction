justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
other
preliminary
question.
is
the
highway
marked
so
that
it
says
you
are
now
entering
or
now
leaving
the
reservation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
was
it
important
for
the
plaintiff
to
go
to
the
tribal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
important
for
her?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
a
choice
of
law
question
isn't
necessarily
due
process.
it
can
be
in
extreme
cases,
but
if
there's
a
valid
basis
or
an
arguable
base
for
choosing
either
law
you
can't
get
into
federal
court
under
a
due
process--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--some
of
the
same
questions
that
justice
scalia
is
raising.
could
congress
authorize
this
jurisdiction?
is
that
question
before
us?
or
are
we...
or
are
we
asking
whether
or
not
this
is
inherent
in
tribal
sovereignty
absent
some
extra
directive
from
the
congress?
what
is
the
source
of
the
law
that
controls
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
with
reference...
the
answer
to
your
first
question...
then
there
would
be
no
constitutional
impediment
to
the
exercise
of
tribal
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
put
it
this
way,
there
would
be
no
due
process
violation
in
subjecting
the...
your
client
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
why
did
you
say
that
congress
could
authorize
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
are
you
asking
us
just
to
make
a
general
choice
of
law
rule
as
to
what's
wise?
i
mean,
what
is...
what's
the
controlling
doctrine
that...
that
guides
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
explain
something
to
help
focus
on
the
precise
law
that
we
look
to,
to
resolve
this
case?
if
a
state
court
exercises
personal
jurisdiction
over
someone
erroneously...
there's
no
personal
jurisdiction...
that
person
doesn't
run
into
federal
court
and
get
an
injunction.
what
was
the
theory
on
which
you
went
into
federal
court
here
originally?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
is
that...
was
it
a
violation
of
a
federal
standard
or
a
federal
law
for
the
tribe
to
proceed
that
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
saying
that
there
is
no
authority
to
proceed,
but
i'm
not
sure
why
that's...
presents
a
federal
question,
until
they...
until
they
try
to
levy
on
your
assets
or
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
is
that
any
different
from
my
hypothetical
of
going
into
a
state
court...
a
state
court
exercising
jurisdiction
over
me,
and
i
say,
well,
you
have
no
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
rush
into
federal
court
and
get
an
injunction.
i
don't
see
that
there's
a
federal
question
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
there
a
federal
question
of
jurisdiction
over...
any
question
of
indian
law?
