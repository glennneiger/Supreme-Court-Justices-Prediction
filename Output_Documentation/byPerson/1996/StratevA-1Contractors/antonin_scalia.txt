justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
your
assertion
that
the
tribe...
you
keep
referring
to
adjudicatory
jurisdiction.
as
i
recall,
you
say
it
is
possible
for
the
tribal
court
to
adjudicate
the
case
but
not
to
apply
tribal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
ask
us
to
decide
right
here
whether
they
should
apply
tribal
law
or
not,
or
do
you
think
they
shouldn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nuechterlein,
if
this
is
a
problem,
i
suppose
it's
a
problem
that
only
takes
a
federal
statute
to
solve,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
the
question
is,
has...
do
the
current
federal
statutes
leave
it
to
the
tribal
court
to
decide
the
case,
and
perhaps
leave
it
to
the
tribal
court
without
any
review
in
federal
courts
to
decide
what
substantive
law
to
apply--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
their
issue,
and
if
you're
wrong
about
getting
out
of
tribal
court,
congress
can
solve
that
problem
by
passing
a
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
those
reasons
are
very
interesting,
as
are
our
prior
cases.
is
there
any
text
that
we
can
look
to
for
the
answer
to
this
question
that...
anybody
talk
about
any
statutory
provision,
treaty
provision...
what...
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
the
text
that
we're
talking
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
decide
this
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that's
fortuitous,
just
because
there
happens
to
be
no
property
on
the
reservation
that
could
be
seized?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
know,
the
same
situation
exists
if
it's
a
suit
between
two
indians
or,
i
assume,
a
suit
between
one
indian
and
a
person
off
the
reservation.
why
do
we...
why
is
it
so
terrible
that...
that
two
non-indians
can't
get
review
of
a
tribal
court
judgment
by
a
federal
or
state
court,
but
not
terrible
that...
that
two
indians
can't
get
a
review
of
a
similarly
outrageous
tribal
court?
i
mean,
do
we
care
more
about
non-indians
than
indians
for
some
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we're
content
with
that
rule
for
indians,
why...
why
can't
we
be
content
with
it
for
non-indians?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i'm
a
virginian,
but
virginia
can...
can
deny
me
due
process
just
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
just
don't
think
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--happy
family,
and
never
deprive
one
another
of
due
process--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
and
think
it's
some...
i
don't
know...
bucolic,
pre-nature
regime
there?
i
don't
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
injustice
could
exist
just
as
well
between...
in
a
suit
between
two
indians.
and
if
we're
resigned
to
not
having
that
reviewed
for
them,
i
don't
know
why
we
can't
be
resigned
to
not
having
that
reviewed
for
a
suit
between
two
non-indians.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
stay
on
the
good
roads;
you've
got
nothing
to
worry
about.
stay
on
the
state
highways.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
tribe
had
not
given
up
the
easement
to
the
state
for
the
highway,
could
non-tribal
members
be
totally
excluded?
i
mean,
can
the
tribe
just
say,
you
know,
we
don't
want
to
give
the
state
any
highway
land,
and
since
there
are
no
state
highways,
no
outsiders,
just
tribal
members.
can
the
tribe
do
that?
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
did
it
go
along
with
this
easement
that
the
tribe
promised
not
to
exclude
anybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say,
i
am
confused
by
the
easement
discussion.
i'm...
you
know,
a
sovereign
can
cede
land,
even
the
whole
fee
much
less
an
easement,
without
conceding
any
sovereignty
over
that
land.
if
i
purchased
land
from
the
united
states,
the
united
states
doesn't
give
up
jurisdiction
over
that
land.
it's
still
subject
to
united
states
law.
i
don't
know
that
the
fact
that
the
tribe
gives
an
easement
to
a
state
necessarily
means
that
the
tribe
thereby
cedes
all
of
its
jurisdictional
responsibility
over
the...
over
the
land
as
to
which
the
easement
was
given.
why
do
you
assume
that's
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
the
tribe
could
not
regulate
indians
on
that...
on
that
easement,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
over
non-indians,
you
would
say,
though.
so,
i
mean,
your
highway
principle
that
justice
souter
was
discussing
with
you
would
only
apply
to
regulation
of
non-indians
on
the
highway?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
it's
given
up
the
power
not
only
to
exclude
them
from
the
road,
but
the
power
to
exclude
them
from
the
reservation.
so,
i
mean,
if
you
follow
that
logic,
they
would
not
have...
they
would
not
have
power
to
regulate
their
activities
on
the
rest
of
the
reservation
either?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
given
up
the
power
to
exclude
generally
from
the
reservation?
