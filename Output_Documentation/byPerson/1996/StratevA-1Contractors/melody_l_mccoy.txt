ms.

l.
mccoy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
an
indian
tribe
has
jurisdiction
over
a
tort
action
between
two
non-indians.
a-1
contractors
was
working
on
the
fort
berthold
indian
reservation
for
the
tribe's
company.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
the
reservation
is
within
the
state
of
north
dakota.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
the
state
that
sets
the
speed
limit.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
those
are
set
by
both
the
tribe
and
the
state.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
at
this
time,
your
honor,
there's
never
been
a
case
that's
answered
any
kind
of
conflict
between
the
regulatory
jurisdiction.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct,
as
does
the
tribe.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
as
can
the...
that's
correct,
as
can
the
federal
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
the
tribal
police.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
primarily
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
the
tribe.
there
are
also...
this
particular
stretch
of
road
is
a
very
small
spur
of
a
state
highway.
it's
not
a
major
thoroughfare.
on
all
of
the
roads--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--not
if
the
person
is
a
non-indian.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct.
however,
non-indians
do
answer
to
civil
traffic
offenses
to
the
tribe,
even
when
they're
cited
by
non-tribal
or
non-federal
law
enforcement--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--speeding,
open
container--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--those
are
punishable
by
fine.
they
are
civil
offenses,
civil
traffic
offenses,
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that...
the
accident
in
this
case
occurred
on
the
state
highway,
but
the
state
highway
is
a
very
recent
easement,
a
1970
easement
by
the
federal
government.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
there
are...
there's
a
sign
at
the
very
entry
to
the
reservation.
it
only
runs
into
the
reservation
for
about
7
miles,
but
there's
a
sign,
both
the
state
speed
limit
sign
and
the
sign
that
you
are
entering
the
fort
berthold
indian
reservation.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
there's
not
a
definitive
answer
from
this
court
as
to
that
question,
but
we
would
concede
that
yes--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--that's
correct,
concurrent.
what
we're
asking
is
the
court
also
recognize--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--no,
the
court
has
not.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
yes.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
three
affiliated
tribes
v.
wold
decision
of
1986,
where
the
civil
cause
of
action
arose
on
the
reservation,
this
very
reservation,
in
fact,
and
this
court
held
that
the
tribe
could
bring
the
claim
against,
in
that
case,
a
non-indian
in
the
state
courts
on
the
theory
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct,
and
here--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
here...
here
the
plaintiff
in
tribal
court
is
an
elderly
woman
who
was
married
to
a
tribal
member,
and
she
was
going
towards
the
home
on
the
trust
allotment
there
that
this
highway
runs
over.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct.
i
think,
though,
there's
two
answers
to
your
question.
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
under
our
primary
theory,
which
is
that
indian
tribes
have
jurisdiction
over
the
conduct
of
non-indians,
including
mrs.
fredericks
and
a-1
contractors,
when
the
case
arises
on
indian
land,
and
on
our
alternative
theory
it's
not
relevant
either,
because
our
alternative
theory
is
that--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--that's
correct.
it
is
our
position
that
this
highway
constitutes
indian
land
sufficient--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--it's
a
state
easement,
a
much
lesser
interest
than
a
fee
simple.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct,
and
it's
clear
that
this
highway
crosses
exclusively
indian
trust
land
for
all
of
6-1/2
miles
on
the
reservation.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
at
the
lake.
there's
a
lake,
sakakawea.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
on
the
fort
berthold
indian
reservation,
this
road
was
originally...
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it
was
originally
a
bureau
of
indian
affairs
gravel
service
road
that
ran
to
the
original
capital,
or
headquarters
of
this
tribe's
reservation.
that
road
has
been
there
since
at
least,
according
to
corps
of
engineer
maps,
since
the
1940's.
below
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
it
was...
it
has
been
a
state
highway.
in
the
1940's,
when
the
garrison
dam
was
built
and
the
lake
was
flooded
onto
the
reservation,
the
tribe's
capital
was
flooded,
and
that
was
subsequently
moved.
but
as
to
this
road,
it
remained
a
gravel
bia
service
road,
only
it
stopped
at
the
lake
because
the
lake
came
to
meet
the
road.
in
1970,
the
tribe
wanted
this
road
paved
to
serve
the
tribal
community
of
twin
buttes
on
the
reservation,
because
the
lake
had
so
isolated
twin
buttes.
the
only
things
in
twin
buttes,
population
300,
are
a
k
through
8
tribal
school,
a
satellite
clinic
for
the
indian
health
service,
the
tribal
community
center
that
a-1
contractors
helped
to
build,
and
a
now-shut-down-due-to-downsizing
bureau
of
indian
affairs
substation.
this
is
not
a
major
marina
for
this
lake.
those
are
on
other
parts
of
the
reservation.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
it's
my
understanding
there
are
two
dock
sites,
one
at
red
buttes
and
one
at...
they're...
twin
buttes
itself
is
about
3
miles
below
the
lake
on
the
highway,
and
the
two
docks,
they're
not
really
full-blown
marinas,
are
to
the
left
and
right
of
that...
you
know,
the
east
and
west
of
that
on
the
lake.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct,
but
the
highway
is
also
used,
you
know...
that's
seasonal
use.
the
tribe
in
fact
regulates
seasonal
vehicle
use
on
that
stretch
of
the
highway,
but
there
are
many
other
roads
on
the
fort
berthold
reservation
that
provide
the
major
access
for
recreation
and
use
of
this
lake.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that
was
her
choice
of
forum
that
she
exercised.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
it's
important
for
her
because
she's
very
much
a
member
of
this
reservation
community.
she
lives
on
the
reservation.
her
children
are
enrolled
there.
she
lived
on
her
deceased
tribal
member's
husband
allotment.
that's
the
stretch
of
the
highway
that
crossed
where
the
accident
occurred
in
this
case.
she's
lived
on
this
reservation
since...
for
most
of
her
adult
life,
and
that
is
where
her
choice
of
forum
was.
plus,
she
put
this
court's
cases
together...
williams
v.
lee,
1959
case,
that
says
if
you
are
a
non-indian
suing
an
indian
you
have
to
go
to
tribal
court,
and
this
court's
case
in
1987,
10
years
ago,
iowa
mutual,
that
says
if
you're
an
indian
you
can
sue
a
non-indian
in
tribal
court.
she
put
those
two
together
because
she's
a
non-indian
suing
a
non-indian.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
no,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
i
believe
that
the
reference
there
was
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
the
brendale
case,
a
1989
case.
but
that
arose
dealing
with
the
issue
in
brendale
of
the
tribe's
authority
to
regulate
the
private
property
of
non-indians.
that's
not
this
case.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
and
that,
to
the
extent...
i
understand,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
the
plurality
in
brendale
did
hold
that,
that
was
not
necessary
to
the
brendale
ruling
and
i
think
also
the
proper
way
to
read
iowa
mutual
is
that...
i
realize
it
set
the
exhaustion
rule.
it
also
set
the
rule
by
which
exhaustion
would
be
conducted,
or
else
exhaustion
itself
would
be
a
meaningless
exercise,
because
as
this
court
said
in
national
farmers
union,
where
it
expressly
rejected
the
argument
that
respondents
make
here
now
for
a
rule
of
general
and
implicit
divestiture
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction
over
reservation-based
civil
actions,
that
was
unanimously
rejected
in
national
farmers
union.
and
2
years
later
in
iowa
mutual,
when
it
again
dealt
with
the
issue
of
how
to
exhaust,
iowa
mutual
set
a
clear
rule
that
tribal
courts
presumptively
have
jurisdiction
over
reservation-based
civil
actions
against
non-indians,
and
the
lower
courts
have
relied
on
that--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--i
think
that
i...
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
it
was
the
rule
of
that
case
by
which
exhaustion
was
to
be
conducted,
because
it
gives
guidance
to
the
tribal
courts
and
the
federal
courts
on
that
very
issue,
and
we
don't
have
congress
divesting
this
tribe's
jurisdiction.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
we
should
distinguish
between
the
existence
of
the
tribe's
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
issue
here,
and
the
scope
of
the--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--not
necessarily.
we've
offered
the
court
three
alternative
theories
for
dealing
with
this.
the
first
one
is,
if
you
find
the
site
of
this
accident
is
indian
land,
then
this
case
is
very
easy
to
decide
because
the
tribes
can
regulate
non-indians,
a
fortiori,
tort
cases,
no
problem
in
the
courts.
the
second
theory,
though,
i
think
addresses
more
of
what
you
are
saying,
and
that's
if
you
don't
want
to
get
into
the
status
of
the
land
issue,
fee
land
here,
quasi
fee
land,
trust
land,
then
we
offer
the
court
the
opportunity
to
apply
the
rule
for
indian
tribes
that
governments
can
adjudicate
tort
cases
arising
within
their
territory,
because
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case
that
this
case
arose
within
the
reservation
boundaries.
there's
no
issue
of
off-reservation
contacts.
if
the
status
of
the
land
is
not
necessary
to
a
determination
of
the--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--adjudicatory
jurisdiction--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--it's
not.
no
case
of
this
court
has
reached
the
issue
of
tribal
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
on
fee
lands.
however,
iowa
mutual
and
national
farmers
union
both
arose
either
on
non-indian-owned
fee
land
or
on
a
federal
highway
crossing
indian
reservations,
and
the
court
did
not
rule
against
tribal
jurisdiction.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
two
questions.
i
think
that
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue
in
this
case
if
it
chooses
not
to,
because
we're
not
at
that
point
yet.
we're
at
the
threshold
point.
however,
we
would
also
argue
that
if
the
court
wants
to
set
the
rule
that
it
could
be
on
a
case-by-case...
it
should
be
on
a
case-by-case
basis
because
it
might
involve
fee
land,
it
might
involve
quasi
fee
land,
it
might
involve
trust--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--it's
quite
common,
your
honor,
that
in
cases,
nonresident
tort,
motor
vehicle
tort
cases
that
the
test
is
higher.
it's
significant
context,
and
often
they
apply
the
forum...
not
the
forum
jurisdiction
law,
but
the
law
of
the
other...
the
residents.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
i
think
that's
been
the
traditional
rule,
but
more
and
more
the
state
courts
are
moving
towards
a
more...
a
significant--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--the
closest
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
briefs
are
the
allstate
v.
shutts
and
the
hague
for...
they're
not
particularly
analogous,
because
they
were
not
motor
vehicle
tort
cases.
they
were
other
kinds
of
civil
tort--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--in
this
tribe?
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
they
follow
state
law.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct.
they
do
not
have
a--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--in
this
case
north
dakota
has
both
a
supreme
court
case
and
a
supreme
court
rule
of
the
state
court
that
deal
with
enforcement
of
tribal
court
judgments
when
it
needs
to
be
enforced
by
a
court.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
i
believe
that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
that's
correct.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
as
a
theoretical
matter
i
think
there's
again
the
argument
that
it's
the
sovereign
forum's
choice
whether
to
apply
its
own
law.
i
don't
know
the
answer,
but
i
know
the
test.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
this
tribe
has
no
substantive
body
of
law,
that's--
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
--that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
melody
l.
mccoy
i
think
that's
right,
and
it's
also
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
in
this
case
both
of
the
parties
happen
to
be
citizens
of
north
dakota.
thank
you.
