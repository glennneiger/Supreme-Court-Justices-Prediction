mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
it
is
true,
justice
o'connor,
that
in
iowa
mutual--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
believe
the
answer
is
probably
yes,
although
this
court
has
not
specifically
addressed
that
issue.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
think
if
a
challenge
goes
directly
to
the
scope
of
the
tribe's
jurisdiction--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
choosing
its
own
law
in
the
course
of
adjudication
is
a
form
of
exercising
jurisdiction.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
and
the
reason
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes
is
because
as
a
matter
of
comity
among
sovereigns
it
is
important
for
there
to
be
a
federal
review
of
a
tribal
exercise
of--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
but
that
case
has
not
yet
arisen
before
this
court.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
true.
i
think
the
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
that
congress
has
specifically
given
the
losing
party
in
the
state
court
system
a
right
to
appeal
to
this
court
to
allege
under
the
due
process
and
full
faith
and
credit
clauses--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
congress
has
not
passed
a
statute
giving
this
court
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy,
but
there
are
in
fact
important
federal
constraints
on
a
forum's
choice
of
its
own
law.
as
this
court
held
in
cases
like
shutts
and
allstate
the
scope
of
a
forum
jurisdiction's
ability
to
choose
its
own
law
as
the
rule
of
conduct
is
narrow--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
in
the
subsequent
case,
justice
ginsburg,
of
phillips
petroleum
v.
shutts
this
court
did
in
fact
invalidate
the
choice
of
kansas
law
as
the
rule
of
decision--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
think
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
i
think
there's
an
important
difference.
this
court
in
cases
like
montana,
brendale
and
bourland
has
pointed
out
that
the
scope
of
a
tribe's
ability
to
regulate
non-indians,
at
least
on
certain
kinds
of
lands
within
a
reservation,
is
subject
to
stricter
limitations
than
a
state's
ability
to
regulate
outsiders.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
correct,
and
i--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
think
congress
has
spoken
to
that
consideration.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that's
correct,
and
i
think
it's
also
significant
in
that
regard
that
in
1993
congress
based
the
indian
tribal
justice
act,
which
commits
essential
federal
resources
to
the
development
of
tribal
courts
on
the
premise
embraced
by
this
court
in
iowa
mutual
that
tribal
jurisdiction
over
events
arising
on
a
reservation
presumptively
does
lie
in
tribal
court.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
as
an
initial
matter,
justice
breyer,
we
believe
that
both
the
state
and
the
tribe
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
this
sort
of
suit
in
the
same
way
that
adjoining
states
often
have
jurisdiction
over
accidents--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
think
actually
the
approach
that
best
saves
resources
is
the
one
adopted
by
this
court
in
iowa
mutual
for
the
following
reason.
it
is
undisputed
that
a
tribe
has
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
even
over
nonconsenting
non-indians
in
cases
where
the
tribe
can
point
to
a
particularized
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
dispute
sufficient
to
justify
the
application
of
tribal
regulatory
authority
under
the
montana
tribal
interest
test.
that
test
looks
to
see
whether
or
not
the
activities
of
non-indians
have
a
direct
effect
on
tribal
welfare
or
whether
or
not
they've
entered
into--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--the...
no
one...
no
court
has
yet
addressed
whether
that's
present
here,
and
it's
my
point
that
it
should
be
the
tribal
court
in
the
first
instance
that
determines
whether
or
not
that
fact-specific
inquiry
is,
indeed,
satisfied.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
think
that's
not
quite
accurate,
justice
o'connor.
in
this
case--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
in
this
case,
for
example--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--in
this
case,
it's
my
understanding
that
a-1
has
no
assets
on
the
reservation,
so
to
enforce
the
tribal
judgment
the
prevailing
litigant
would
have
to
go
to
state
court
and
persuade
that
court
that
the
underlying
tribal
proceedings
comported
with
the
rules
of
comity
that
are
applicable
to
the
enforcement
of
the
foreign
judgment.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
yes,
they
would,
justice--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--yes,
they
would.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
yes,
they
would.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
think
this
court's...
justice
souter,
i
think
this
court's
precedents
recognize
that
the
tribe
would
always
have
jurisdiction
not
just
to
regulate
conduct
but
also
to
adjudicate
disputes
in
cases
where
the
tribe
has
a
particularized
interest.
that
aspect
of
the
tribe's
sovereignty
has
remained
intact.
it's
the--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
think
that
whenever
we
recognize
that
there
are
a
variety
of
sovereigns
within
our
nation,
whether
they're
states
or
indian
tribes,
jurisdictional
issues
will
arise.
i
think
the
best
rule
to
apply
here--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
think
that
the
best
rule
is,
in
fact,
that
one,
and
this
is
the
reason
why.
this
court
has
constantly
recognized
that
indian
tribes
retain
the
core
sovereign
authority
to
regulate
conduct
that
poses
a
threat...
may
i
finish
my
sentence?
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
poses
a
threat
to
the
integrity
of
the
tribe.
it
should
be
the
tribal
court
in
the
first
instance
that
makes
that
determination.
that's
the
implicit
premise
of
national
farmers
union.
it
would
be
inefficient
not
to
let
the
tribe
complete
the
adjudication.
