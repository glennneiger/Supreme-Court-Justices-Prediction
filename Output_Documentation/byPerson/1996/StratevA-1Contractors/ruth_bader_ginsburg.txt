justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there,
ms.
mccoy,
some
dispute
about
the
second
case
that
you
mention,
whether
it
meant
anything
more
than
you
have
to
exhaust
the
tribal
court
process?
it
didn't
make
an
ultimate
determination
that
there
was
tribal
court
jurisdiction.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
not
so
that
subsequent
cases
of
this
court
have
said
that
about
iowa
mutual?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
whatever
brendale
involved,
it
did
distinguish
iowa
mutual
on
the
basis
that
it
was
merely
an
exhaustion,
that
there
was
no
determination
that
the
tribe
as
opposed
to
the
state
had
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
that
question,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
two
are
tied
together.
if
you're
basing
the
jurisdiction
on,
it
happened
on
our
land,
whether
the
underlying...
it
happened
on
our
land,
then
the
most
basic
choice
of
law
rule
is
the
place
of
injury.
the
law
comes
from
the
place
of
injury,
and
when
you
have
a
coincidence
between
the
forum
and
the
place
of
injury,
what
other
law
would
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
whole
idea
of
the
nonresident
motor
vehicle
statute
is
that
the...
committing
the
act
in
the
territory,
having
the
accident
there,
there's
no
counting
of
other
contexts.
it's,
the
accident
happened
there.
that's
a
basis
for
both
jurisdiction
and
well-accepted
that
you
apply
the
local
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
case
where
an
accident
happened
inside
a
forum
and
the
forum
didn't...
applied
some
other
law
to
the...
to
determine
the
regulating
rules
for
that,
for
the
conduct
of
the
driver?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
certainly
could...
would
be
unthinkable
in
a
sister
state
context,
that
a
second
state
could
second-guess
the
first
state's
choice
of
law
in
a
collateral
attack.
isn't
that...
isn't
there
a
definite
no,
a
sister
state
can't
do
that
to
each
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
you
said
it
held
in
allstate,
but
allstate,
some
might
have
regarded
the
homing
instinct
of
that
state
court
as
exorbitant,
and
yet
this
court
held
that
it
didn't
violate
due
process
for
the
state
to
prefer
itself,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
allstate
proves
that
at
the
very
least
this
court
has
been
extraordinarily
indulgent
to
choice
of
law
decisions
made
by
a
forum.
isn't
that
what
one
would
take
away
from
allstate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
certainly
not
as
to
an
accident
that
happened
within
a
reservation.
i
mean,
wasn't
the
shutts
concern
people
who
were
outside
kansas
whose
entire
connection
to
this
venture
was
outside
kansas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
result
would
be
different
if
the
accident
had
occurred
inside
the
reservation,
on
a
reservation
road,
not
a
road
on
which
the
state
had
a
perpetual
easement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you're
not
relying
on,
as
justice
souter
spoke,
this
case
could
be...
could
be
described
as
a
state
highway
case,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
but
i
think
you're
telling
us
now
that...
that
even
if
it
occurred
on
a
reservation
road,
there
would
not
be
tribal
jurisdiction.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
wouldn't
it
operate...
ms.
mccoy,
i
think,
told
us
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
to
enforce
a
judgment
of
this
nature
rendered
by
the
tribe,
you'd
have
to
go
into
state
court,
bring
a
fresh
proceeding,
to
enforce
that
judgment.
and
couldn't
the
defendant
in
that
enforcement
proceeding
say
that
i
recognize
indian
tribal
sovereignty;
it's
like
the
sovereignty
of
france
or
italy.
when
we're
dealing
with
a
sovereign
to
whom
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
doesn't
apply,
then
we
have
certain
checks.
and
one
of
them
is
due
process.
so
we
would
look
to
the
particular
proceeding
and
see
if
essentially
fair
procedure
was
accorded
in
the
tribal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ward,
do
you
agree
that
if
we
take
what
justice
souter
suggested
might
be
a
rule
of
the
road
here...
that
is,
if
it's
an
interstate
highway,
it's
a
state
highway,
then
the
state...
this
case
belongs
in
state
court
and
state
law
will
apply.
but
we
don't
get
into
any
of
these
other
questions
that
might
arise
if
this
accident
occurred
on
a
road
within
the
reservation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
ward,
here's
a
question
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
isn't
this...
this
kind
of
case
can
only
come
up
if
the
plaintiff...
even
if
a
nonmember
would
have
a
real
close
affiliation
with
the
tribe.
in
the
cases
justice
breyer
was
suggesting,
it's
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum.
most
non-indians
probably
wouldn't
go
to
the
tribal
court
in
this
kind
of
accident.
but
this
non-indian
had
a
very
close
relationship
with
the
tribe.
and
so
that's
why
she
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
a
tribe
claims
exclusive
jurisdiction,
which
i
believe
is
what
justice
breyer
was
suggesting...
claim
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
distinguished
from
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
state
over
a
tort
that
happens
on
a
highway
or
on
fee
land?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you
know
of
any
tribe
that
has
asserted
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
distinguished
from
concurrent
jurisdiction,
where
the
plaintiff
chooses
the
forum?
