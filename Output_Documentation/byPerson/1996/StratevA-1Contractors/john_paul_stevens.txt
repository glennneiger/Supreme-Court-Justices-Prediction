justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
i
have
two
questions
i
want
to
get
in
before
you
lose
your
time.
is
there
a
body
of
indian
law
on
issues
such
as
contributory
negligence
and
comparative
negligence,
and
what
is...
you
know,
all
the...
is
there
a
common
law
that's
been
developed
in
the
tribe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
follow
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
second
question
is,
how
does
the...
how
would
the
plaintiff
get
the
judgment
enforced
if
the
plaintiff
got
a
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
bring
an
independent
proceeding
in
state
court
to
get
it
enforced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
really
completely
true?
some
have
argued
that
one
of
the
sources
of
tribal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
is
the
power
to
exclude.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
tribe
has
given
up
the
power
to
exclude
non-indians
from
this
road.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
arguably,
they
might
have
given
up
jurisdiction
to
regulate
non-indians
on
this
road?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
one
other
question?
what
if
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
had
been
a
tribal
member,
would
your
case
be
stronger
or
weaker?
