where
is
the
reservation,
ms.
mccoy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
accident
occurred
on
a
state
highway
on
the
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
entity
sets
the
speed
limits
and
the
regulations
for
driving
on
that
state
highway?
is
it
the
state
of
north
dakota?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
other
rules
applicable
to
driving
on
that
state
highway?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
have
different
regulations.
the
state
could
say,
no
left
turn
without
a
stop,
and
the
tribe
could
say
something
the
opposite?
no
right
turn.
no
right
turn,
or
whatever
it
is.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
state
purports
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
and
standards
for
driving
on
that
state
highway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
could
a
state
police
officer
be
there
and
issue
citations
for
a
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
the
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
fact,
who
does
police
that
stretch
of
road?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
well,
if
a
criminal
traffic
citation
were
issued
by
a
bia
staff
person
or
a
tribal
policeman,
would
the
subsequent
prosecution
be
conducted
in
tribal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
that
would
go
to
state
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it's
a
criminal
procedure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
a
civil
traffic
offense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
those
aren't
punishable
by
fine
or
imprisonment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
suit
filed
here
is
not
a
traffic
enforcement
suit
of
any
kind.
it's
a
suit
between
two
nontribal
members.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
could
the
suit
have
been
brought
in
state
court,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
concede
that
it
could
have
been.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
this
court
ever
recognized
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
a
civil
context
over
a
suit
that
occurs
on
a
state
highway?
have
we
ever
dealt
with
that,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
ever
dealt
with
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
tribal
courts
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
state
tribal
context?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
plaintiff
there
was
the
tribe
itself?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
a
private
nonmember?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
could
that
make
a
difference?
she
either
is
a
tribal
member
or
she's
not,
and
she's
not.
you
concede
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
state
highway
easement
considered
indian
land?
the
underlying
fee
surely
is
trust
land
probably
held
for
the
indian
tribe.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
indeed,
the
easement
itself
is
held
by
the
state
and
could
be
considered,
i
guess,
state
land
for
that
purpose...
the
easement,
state
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
was
quite
unclear
whether
any
subsequent
challenge
could
be
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
the
challenge
goes
to
the
choice
of
law
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
the
jurisdiction
question
were
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
the
tribal
court
has
jurisdiction.
then
suppose
the
tribal
court
tries
the
case
and
were
to
choose
to
apply
tribal
law.
that's
not
this
case
because
the
petitioner's
counsel
says
we
don't
have
tribal
law,
so
we
wouldn't
do
that.
but
let's
suppose
it's
a
tribe
that
does.
they
choose
tribal
law.
can
that
ever
be
tested
in
any
subsequent
proceeding
in
a
federal
or
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there's
no
case,
is
there,
holding
that
yes,
sure,
you
can
have
subsequent
review
in
another
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
congress
hasn't
done
that
for
tribal
court
judgments.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
is
that
present
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
if
it
goes
to
trial
in
the
tribal
court
and
the
tribe
chooses
to
use
as
the
jury
all
the
friends
and
relatives
of
the
victim,
and
they
say,
yeah,
she's
really
been
injured,
and
we're
going
to
give
a
heck
of
a
verdict
here,
and
they
do,
and
suppose
other
errors
that
might
amount
to
a
due
process
violation
in
a
federal
or
state
court
obtain.
there
is
no
way
to
challenge
that
as
a
due
process
violation
later
in
any
state
or
federal
court,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
be
the
mechanism--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
a
subsequent
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
those
questions
be
open--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
enforcement--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
north
dakota?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
they
should
recognize
tribal
sovereignty
as
well.
i
mean,
you're
just
defending
the
ignorant,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
not
challenging
the
concept
of
indian
tribal
sovereignty,
surely?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
this
court,
in
many
decisions,
has
recognized
that.
the
federal
government
has
recognized
it.
it's
a
fact
of...
of
existence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
could
you
raise
that?
by...
by
what
mechanism
do
you
think
you
could
get
into
another
court
to...
to
raise
some
due
process
challenge
to
what
actually
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
it's
just
an
easement,
like
any
other
highway
easement
or
like
any
other
utility
easements.
it
is
a
permission
for
the
state
to
have
a
highway
there,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
we
have.
it's
part
of
the
total
bundle
of
property
rights.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
we
heard
that
the
tribe
also
regulates
the
rules
of
the
road,
so
to
speak,
on
this
highway;
is
that
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
they
have
regulations
governing
the
use
of
this
highway?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
nonmembers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
heard
to
the
contrary
from
the
petitioners'
counselor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
your
understanding
is
different
from
petitioners'
counsel--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
this
regard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
sure
it
could.
well,
haven't
we
had
cases
involving
that;
that
on
tribal
land,
the
tribe
has
the
right
to
exclude
others?
we've
had
cases
decided
on
that
very
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
aren't
there
in
fact
children
of
the
named
plaintiff...
adult
children...
who
are
tribal
members
who
have
claims
in
this
very
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
they
are
tribal
members?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
their
claims
are
not
before
us?
