justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
civil
tort
suit
on
fee
lands.
i
mean,
you
know,
a
tribe
has
some
lands,
it
sells
some
lands
to
people
who
are
not
indian
member,
tribe
members,
and
there's
a
slip-and-fall
accident.
does
that
mean
those
court
cases
have
to
go
to
the
tribal
court?
i
mean,
the
state
court
couldn't
handle
an
ordinary
slip-and-fall
accident
on
a
fee
land?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
what
i
wondered.
i
mean,
i
understand
much
better
since
your
explanation
why
the
tribe
really
thinks
of
this,
the
highway,
as
really
its
highway,
and
i
can
understand
why
they
think
that,
but
i
guess
we
have
to
decide
this
as
if
it
were
interstate
93,
or...
isn't
that
right
+/?
and
the
two
people
involved
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
tribe
whatsoever,
going
down
the
biggest
state
10-lane
highway
in
imagination,
which
had...
just
happened
to
cross
the...
an
indian
tribe's
land,
and
under
an
easement...
i
mean,
we'd
have
to
decide
it
on
that
basis,
wouldn't
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
my
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
clear,
in
an
ordinary
slip-and-fall
tort
accident
in
the
middle
of
a
reservation,
but
on
fee
land
involving
non-indians,
that
those
cases
go
as
a
matter
of
course
to
tribal
courts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what
sense
does
it...
i
mean,
suppose
there
is
room
in
the
cases
to
go
either
way.
i
could
understand
a
rule
that
says,
people
who
build
houses
in
fee...
you
know,
i'm
thinking
that
this
highway
is
a
like
a
fee
land.
i
realize
that's
a
big
issue
in
dispute,
but
assume
it
is
for
the
sake
of
argument.
two
people
who
are
not
indians
living
on
the
land
in
fee,
they
have
a
house
like...
you
know,
they
have
no...
i
can
understand
a
rule
that
say,
they
have
to
go
to
the
tribal
court,
and
tribal
law
applies.
that
would
be
one
rule.
that's
a
possible
rule.
that's
how
you
treat
california,
probably.
or
i
could
understand
a
rule
which
said,
well,
it's
not
like
california.
it's
a
rule
that
south
dakota
law
applies.
then
have
them
go
to
south
dakota
court.
i
mean,
what
good
does
this
mixing
up
of
everything
do
except
to
leave...
the
lawyers
will
get
very
mixed
up
and
the
judge
will
get
mixed
up,
and
it
will
mean
a
lot
of
extra
cost
and
very
hard
to
sort
out
who
goes
where.
i
mean,
what's
to
be
said
against
simplifying
this?
if
it's
south
dakota
law
on
the
fee
thing,
go
to
the
south
dakota
court.
if
it's
the
tribal
law,
go
to
the
tribal
court,
if
there's
room
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
jurisdiction.
i'm
saying
if
we
had
room
to
do
it,
why
wouldn't
the
sensible
thing
be
to
simplify?
if
it's
the
state
law
that
governs
it,
have
them
go
to
a
state
court.
if
it's
the
tribal
law
that
governs
it,
have
them
go
to
a
tribal
court.
that
way
we'd
save
legal
fees,
time,
and
effort.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
is
it
different,
when
you
go
to
maine
from
massachusetts,
you
know,
very
few
people
know,
but
you
have
to
go
through
new
hampshire?
[laughter]
and
you
could
be
subject
to
the
courts--
--i
know
someone
who
knows
that.
i
know
someone
who
knows
that.
isn't...
isn't
there
kind
of
a
dual
concern
implicit
in
what
you're
saying
here?
it's
perfectly
true
that
when
you
go
from
north
dakota
to
south
dakota
you
realize
you're
going
into
a
different
jurisdiction.
but
the
general
assumption
that's
made
is
highway
laws,
liability
rules
and
so
on
are
generally,
more
or
less,
the
same.
so
that
the
substantive
legal
regime
probably
is
not
changing
very
much.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here,
however,
i
think,
underlying
some
of
your
argument
are
two
suggestions.
one
is
we
really
don't
have
a
sense
of
what
the
legal
regime
is
going
to
be
if
we
are
subject
to
tribal
jurisdiction
with
the
probability
of
tribal
substantive
law.
and,
number
two...
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
was
pretty
explicit
about
this...
there
is
a
real
concern
about
fairness
of
treatment
in
the
tribal
courts
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
tribal
judges
can
be
removed
by
the
tribal
political
authorities,
in
effect,
if
they
don't
like
the
results.
are
those
two
reasons...
the
fact
that
we
have
real
question
about
what
the
substantive
legal
regime
will
be
in
a
tribal
court
and,
number
two,
we
have
a
real
question
about
due
process
because
of
the
appointment
scheme...
are
those
two
reasons,
reasons
that
you
rely
significantly
on
and
feel
that
we
should
rely
significantly
on
in
deciding
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
normally
work
with...
i
mean,
this
notion
of
splitting
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
for...
from
legislative
or
regulatory
jurisdiction
is
rather
interesting.
i
just
wonder,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
the
dakotas
or
montana
or
places
where
there
are
quite
a
few
reservations
and
alienated
quite
a
lot
of
land,
so
that
there
are
many
fee...
inhabitants
who
own
their
land
in
fee,
what's
the
expectation
now,
how
does
it
work
when
there's
a
simple
accident,
a
tort,
a
slip-and-fall,
a
contract
dispute,
not
with
any
of
the
tribes,
but...
i
mean,
do
those
people
now
think
they're
supposed
to
go
to
a
tribal
court
to
get
their
matter
adjudicated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
go
to
the
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
are
you
aware
of
any
instances
in
which
tribal
courts
took
jurisdiction
over
these
simple
slip-and-fall,
normal
contract
disputes
on
the
houses
or
farms
of
the
people
who
hold
their
land
in
fee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
that?
why
is
that?
i
don't...
i
mean,
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why,
if
in
fact
there
is
adjudicatory
authority
in...
over,
say,
this...
if
this
is
equivalent
to
fee
and
there
is
adjudicatory
authority
of
the
tribal
court
over
people
who
hold
their
title
in
fee,
then
why
couldn't
the
tribe,
if
it
wished
to,
say
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
tribal
court
whether
you're
related
to
somebody
who's
a
member
of
the
tribe,
whether
you're
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
fact,
then
i
think
the
issue
in
this
case...
there
are
two
issues.
one
is
whether
they're
going
to
have
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
over
all
accidents,
contracts
on
fee
land,
or
the
second
issue
could
be
this
isn't
fee
land;
this
is
not
fee
land.
this
is
an
easement...
shouldn't
be
treated
as
fee
land.
so
i'd
appreciate
your
addressing
that
second
contention
briefly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
say
"not",
then
they
win,
i
think.
i
think
you're...
you're
talking
about
fee
land
in--
