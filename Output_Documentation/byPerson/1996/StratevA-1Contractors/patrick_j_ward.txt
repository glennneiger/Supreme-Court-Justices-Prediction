mr.
patrick
j.
ward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has,
on
several
occasions,
indicated
reasons
why
the
tribal
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
mr.
stockert
and
a-1
in
this
case.
tribal
courts
exist
primarily
to
apply
tribal
customs
between
tribal
members.
in
this
instance,
the
tribe
has
given
up
its
power
to
exclude
nonmembers
from
the
state
highway.
in
using
the
state
highway
on
this
occasion,
mr.
stockert
did
not
give
up
his
rights
to
due
process,
equal
protection
or
trial
by
a
jury
of
his
peers.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
not
in
an
incidence
involving
two
nonmembers
of
the
tribe.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
your
honor,
yes.
in
this...
the
precedents
of
this
court's
would
indicate
that
the
state's
authority
over
nonmembers
of
the
tribe,
over
its
citizens,
reaches
into
the
reservation.
and
so
it
doesn't
necessarily
require
that
the
road
has
been
alienated
by
the
tribe.
but
in
this
case,
that
gives
the
respondents
an
even
stronger
position,
because
this
is
a
state
highway
and
it
is
regulated
by
the
state
and
it
is
controlled
by
the
state.
and
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
there
are
interstate
highways
that
run
through
reservations
as
well.
and
citizens
of
this
country
have
no
idea
when
they
enter
an
interstate
highway
to
travel
to
yellowstone
park
or
something
out
in
the
west
that
they're
subjecting
themselves
to
the
tort
jurisdiction
of
a
tribal
court
that
could
deprive
them
of
their
property.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
your
honor,
i
think
it
makes
a
great
impression.
i
think
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
recognize
the
sovereignty
of
different
states
and
are
comfortable
with
that.
but
when
they--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
no,
your
honor;
i
believe
that
there
are
limits
on
tribal
sovereignty.
and
this
court
has
indicated
that
in
the
past.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
no,
your
honor.
they
should
be
based
on
the
historical
record.
they
should
be
based
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
on
the
constitutional--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
justice
souter,
those
are
two
significant
reasons,
i
agree
with
that.
we
rely
on
those
reasons
and,
in
addition,
we
rely
on
all
of
the
other
reasons
we
have
stated.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
there
are
treaties--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--your
honor,
there...
there
is--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--there
is
no
specific
text,
in
the
sense
of
a
statute,
that
addresses
this
question.
there
are
treaties
with
the
tribe.
and
in
those
treaties,
the
tribe
has
historically
recognized
the
right
of
safe
passage
for
people
passing
through
the
reservation.
if...
if
one
looks
at
those
treaties,
those
treaties...
never...
if
you
look
at
the
common
notions
of
the
day
at
the
time
that
those
treaties
were
entered
into,
these
tribes,
from
the
time
almost
20
years
after
lewis
and
clark
to
this
day,
realized
that
there
would
be
rights
of
way,
there
would
be
people
passing
through,
and
they
would
not
interfere
with
the
rights
of
those
people
passing
through.
and
if--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--the...
the...
in
answer
to
your
first
question,
yes,
justice
kennedy,
the
congress
could
create
this
jurisdiction
if
it
chose
to
do
so.
but
it
hasn't.
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
this...
this
case
below
has
been
decided
on
the
issue
of
the
inherent
sovereignty.
and
that
question
is
addressed
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
the
constitutional
impediment
would
be
that
this...
the
constitution
recognizes
two
sovereigns,
the
united
states
and
the
states.
and
unless
that
sovereign...
the
united
states
gives
this
authority...
somehow
delegates
this
authority
to
the
tribes,
the
tribes
do
not
have
it.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
yes,
your
honor,
there
would
be.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
congress
certainly
he
is...
my
client
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
congress
can
certainly
create
a
court
that
he
would
have
to
respond
to,
unless
that
action
itself
was
unconstitutional.
and
we
have
not
addressed
that
question
here.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
no,
we
are
not
questioning
the
concept
of
tribal
sovereignty--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--the
controlling
doctrine
is
the
montana
case
that
was
decided
by
this
case,
which
provides
the
limitations,
or
at
least
addresses
the
limitations,
on
tribal
sovereignty
and
the
exceptions
to
those
limitations
where
nonmembers
are
involved.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
it
was...
it
was
legislative,
but
the
sovereignty
of
a
tribe,
whether
it's
legislative
or
adjudicative,
comes
from
the
same
place.
it
comes
from
whatever
retained
inherent
sovereignty
remained
after
the
tribes
were
incorporated
into
the
united
states.
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
oliphant
and
wheeler,
for
purposes
of
criminal
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
tribal
sovereignty,
and
the
tribe
could
not,
as
in
some
of
the
earlier
examples,
exercise
any
criminal
jurisdiction
over
either
of
the
parties
here
because
they
were
both
nonmembers
of
the
tribe.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
and
also
potentially
to
the
manner
in
which
those
courts
are--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
difficult
problem,
because
the
court's
santa
clara
pueblo
decision
seemed
to
indicate
that
the...
the
issues
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
with
respect
to
due
process
will
not
be
reviewed
except
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
so
unless
there
was
some
revision
of
that
decision
with
respect
to
review
for
nonmembers,
the
santa
clara
pueblo
case
did
involve
a
member,
and
she
was
questioning
tribal...
the
issue
of
tribal
membership
rules.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
there
would
be,
in
this
instance,
a
comity
provision,
pursuant
to
the
north
dakota
rule
with
respect
to
enforcement
of
this
tribal
judgment.
so
there
would
be
some
limited
review.
but--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
no,
i
don't
think
we
do--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--your
honor,
because
indians
are
members
of
the
tribe.
they
choose
to
be
members
of
the
tribe.
they
choose
to
reside
on
the
reservation.
they
benefit
from
that
membership.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
i
would
argue
that
it
can't,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
i
mean,
you
could
challenge
it
if
virginia
did.
you
certainly...
a
non-indian
does
not
have
a
right
to
participate
in
tribal
governance.
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
vote.
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
be
involved
in
any
of
the
decisionmaking.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
your
honor,
i
would
hope
that--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
your
honor,
that
question,
i
guess,
has
not
been
answered
by
this
court,
with
respect
to
non-indians.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it's
not
part
of
this
record,
but
certainly--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
there's
a
case
involving
the
burlington
northern
railroad,
which
filed
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
here,
in
which
the
tribal
jury
was
composed
of
relatives
and
friends
of
the
complainants.
there
was
a
parade
of
horribles
in
that
case
and
an
extremely
unfair
verdict.
and
that
is
pending
review
in
the
9th
circuit--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--yes,
there--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
your
honor,
as
far
as
documentation,
other
than...
there
are
other
cases
that
i'm
aware
of,
where
due
process
violations
are
occurring
in
tribal
courts
with
respect
to
nonmembers--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--there...
there
are
some
law
review
articles
on
the
subject,
your
honor.
the
best,
i
think,
would
be
the
amicus
brief
of
the
burlington
northern
railroad
in
this
case,
and
the
american
automobile
association--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--that's
true.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
that's...
that's
true.
you
could
do
that.
and
in
this
case...
and
that
would
be
consistent,
i
think,
in
this
case,
with
the
alienation
of
the
land
in
the
bourland
case,
which
involved
the
dam
for
lake
oahe,
just
below
the
dam
for
lake
sakakawea,
which
is--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
yes,
they
do.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
involving
nonmembers?
no,
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
those
people
are
treated
as
citizens
of
the
state
of
north
dakota.
they
have
access
to
the
courts
in
the
state--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
why
did
she
choose?
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
your
honor,
the
tribe
could,
assuming
that
the
other
party
was--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
your
honor,
this
is
not
fee
land,
because
this
land
was--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--i...
i'm
sorry--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
you
confused
me.
i
was
confused
by
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
and
what...
what
i
mean
is
this
is...
this...
this
easement
for
this
highway
is
certainly
the
equivalent
of
fee
land.
it
is
an
alienation
of
the
land
by
the
tribe.
it
is
a
giving
up
of
the
power
to
control.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
it
is--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
but
it's...
it's
more
than
that
in
the
sense
that
it's
giving
up
the
power
to
exclude.
it's
giving
up
the
power
to
regulate
the
highway.
the
state
regulates
the
highway.
the
state
sets
the
standards.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
the
tribe...
the
tribe--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--the
tribe
regulates
its
members
with
respect
to
the
highway,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
generally
speaking--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
my
understanding
is
that
the
practical
application
by
the...
by
the
tribe
and
the
highway
patrol
is
that
if
a
non-indian
is
involved,
the
tribe
will
call
in
the
deputy
sheriff
from
the
county
or
they
would
call
in
the
highway
patrol.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
the
tribe,
in
this
instance,
certainly
did
give
up
the
easement.
whether
the
tribe
could
decide
not
to,
i
believe
the
tribe--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--yes...
yes,
you
have,
your
honor.
and
those
cases
involved
reservations,
where
the
tribe
retained
its
power
to
exclude,
as
opposed
to
where
it
had
given
that
up
and
agreed
to
give
free
passage,
and
agreed
to
allow
rights-of-way.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
yes,
your
honor.
the
only
rights
reserved
to
the
tribe
in
the
easement
were
the
right
to
create
crossings
for
purposes
of
approaches
to
farms
and
things
like
that.
otherwise,
the
easement
gave
the
state
the
rights
to
the
surface
of
the
road.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
from
this
court,
your
honor,
where
the
tribe
has--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--i
believe
that
the
tribes,
maybe.
and
i
believe
that
the
effect
of
what
happens,
pursuant
to
the
petitioners'
argument
in
cases...
as
a
result
of
iowa
mutual...
is
that
state
courts
and
federal
courts
are
reluctant
to
proceed
because
the
action
has
been
started
in
a
tribal
court.
and
so,
from
that
standpoint,
whether
the
tribe
asserts
exclusive
jurisdiction,
in
effect,
it
is
by
the
way
that
the
procedure
is
followed
once
that
jurisdiction
is
invoked.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
well--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
the...
the
reason
i
assume
that's
the
case
is
for
reasons
similar
to
the
bourland
decision
of
this
court,
that,
in
that
case,
the
tribe
gave
up
the
authority
over
the
taken
area
for
the
building
of
the
dam
and
for
the
recreational
enjoyment
of
hunting
and
fishing
in
that
area.
and
the
tribe,
similar
to
this
case,
asserted
that
it
maintained
regulatory
control
even
over
non-indians
in
that
area.
and
this
court
decided
no,
it
did
not;
that
it
did
not
retain
that
regulatory
control.
and
it
further
decided
that
that
kind
of
control
was
not
part
of
the
tribe's
inherent
sovereignty.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
well,
your
honor,
this...
this
court
has
never
decided
whether
an
easement
or
an
alienation
of
land
would
give
up
the
authority
over
the
tribal
members.
i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far.
i
think
the
tribe...
the
essence
of
the
tribe's
sovereignty
is
the
tribe's
right
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
its
members.
so,
in
that
sense,
there
may
be
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe
over
its
members
with
respect
to
the
highway.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
exactly,
yes.
until
the...
once
the
state
highway
goes
beyond
the
borders
of
the
reservation,
the
tribe
loses
its
authority
even
over
its
members.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
not
specifically;
no,
your
honor.
what
this
court
stated
in
the
montana
decision--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
yes,
they
have,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
i
would
submit
that
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
this
court--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--that
may
be
true,
your
honor.
because
with
respect
to--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
with
respect
to
these
particular
tribes,
there
are
no
closed
areas
like
there
were
in
the
brendale
decision.
this
is
an
open
reservation.
there
are
approximately
40
percent
fee
land.
close
to
50
percent
of
the
people
living
on
the
reservation
are
nonmembers.
so
there's
a
significant
interaction.
and
from
an
economic
standpoint,
a
decision
that
would
close
the
reservation
or
make
people
fearful
of
entering
the
reservation
for
fear
of
losing
their
property
as
a
result
of
an
adverse
judgment
there
would
not
be
good
for
the
tribes
and
it
would
not
encourage
intercourse
with
the
tribes,
which
is
something
that
congress
has
always
indicated
is
part
of
its
essential
purpose
in
dealing
with
the
tribes--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--the
theory
that
we
originally
went
into
federal
court
was
that
we
had
exhausted
our
tribal
court
remedies
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
and
that
the
tribe
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
involuntarily
force
mr.
stockert
and
a-1
contractors
into
one
of
its
courts
for
purposes
of
a
civil
case.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
it
was
a
violation
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
montana
case
and
a
misapplication
of
the
exceptions
of
that
case
in
order
to--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
federal
question
is
presented
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
deprivation
of
mr.
stockert's
rights.
there
is
a
deprivation
of
his
right
to
have
this
case
heard
in
a
court
to
which
he
is
a
member,
to
which
he
can
vote--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
it's
different
in
the
sense
that
there's
different
sovereigns
involved,
your
honor.
the
states...
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
is
different
from
the
states
and
the
tribes.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
yes,
there
is,
your
honor,
because
the...
because
of
the
plenary
power
of
congress
in
dealing
with
the
indians
that's
referenced
in
the
constitution.
this
court
has
indicated--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--absolutely.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
that's
exactly
what
the
farmers
union
case
said,
your
honor.
the
farmers
union
case
said
that
federal
courts
are
the
final
arbiters
of
questions
of
indian
jurisdiction.
so,
to
the
extent
that
authority
is
needed
for
that
proposition,
it's
in
the
farmers
union
case.
and
it
was
again
in
iowa
mutual.
and
basically,
what
iowa
mutual
was,
was
an
extension
of
that
exhauction
requirement.
but,
again...
and
it
dealt
with
section
1332
jurisdiction
for
diversity
cases.
but
it
extended
that
exhaustion
requirement
that
was
announced
in
farmers
union
and
recognized
that
yes,
it
is
a
federal
question...
the
question
of
indian
jurisdiction
is
a
federal
question,
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
indian
tribes
in
their
dealings
with
the
congress
and
with
the
american
people.
there
has
been
no
congressional
delegation
of
adjudicatory--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--your
honor,
i
believe,
in
this
case,
under
these
facts,
my
case
would
not
be
any
weaker.
the...
the...
if
the
plaintiff
were
a
tribal
member,
you
would
still
have
the
same
issues
of
the
divestment
of
the
highway.
you
would
still
have
the
divestment
of
the
power
to
exclude.
you
would
still
have--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--there
are
adult
children
who
have
consortial
claims
that
they
have
asserted.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
they
are--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
their
claims
are
not
before
us.
those
are
claims
that
are
derivative
and
they
are
essentially
pending
claims.
and
they
can
adequately
be
pursued
in
the
state
courts,
as
well,
pursuant
to
the
second
montana
exception.
to
the
extent
there
is
a
tribal
interest
that
could
be
asserted
here,
however
marginal,
that...
that
interest
could
be
adequately
protected
in
the
state
court.
and
not
only
is
there...
is
petitioner
conceding
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
but
there
is
actually
an
action
pending
in
the
state
court.
and
with
respect
to
the
community
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
petitioners,
the
local
courthouse,
the
closest
local
courthouse...
and
the
state
court
is
actually
closer
to
the
area
where
this
accident
happened
then
the
reservation
courthouse,
which
is
across
the
lake
and
around
the
highway.
since
the
lake
was
constructed,
you
actually
would
have
to
go
around
the
lake
almost...
you
would
have
to
go
far
west
and
then
cross
a
bridge
to
get
to
the
tribe
courthouse
and
you'd
just
go
a
few
miles
south
to
get
to
the
county
courthouse.
so
it's
not
like
there's
any
disadvantage
to
mrs.
frederick's
being
required
to
use
a
state
court
of
which
she's
a
citizen
and
of
which
she
has
power
to
vote.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor--
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
--well,
the
native
american
people
in
our
part
of
the
country
would
argue,
your
honor,
that
it's
not
a
corruption
but
the
actual
pronunciation
of
the
name
is
sakakawea.
mr.
patrick
j.
ward
thank
you.
