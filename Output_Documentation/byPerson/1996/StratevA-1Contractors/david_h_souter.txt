justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
action
were
brought
in
state
court
in
the
first
place,
is
there
any
question
in
your
mind
that
the
state
would
apply
state
law
as
opposed
to
tribal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
a
practical
matter,
though,
we
do
know
the
answer.
they'd
apply
state
law,
wouldn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
yet
if
the
tribal
court
has
jurisdiction,
that
is
a
real
question,
isn't
it,
as
to
which
body
of
law
would
be
applied,
for
the
very
reason
that
justice
ginsburg
raised.
they
might
say,
well,
we're
going
to
apply
tribal
law.
at
the
present
time,
tribal
law
follows
state
law,
but
we
could
develop
tribal
law,
and
our
general
rule
will
be
that
we're
going
to
apply
tribal
law.
that
would
be
possible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
isn't
it
a
consideration
that
we
ought
to
bear
in
mind
in
deciding
this
case
that
people
who
drive
on
a
state
highway
within
state
territorial
jurisdiction
ought
to
have
a
uniform
body
of
law
that
they
can
depend
upon
having
administered
if
there
is
a
tort
so
that
at
least
within
a
given
state
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
suddenly
being
subjected
to
a
new
legal
regime
if
they
happen
to
cross
the
border
into
reservation
territory?
wouldn't
that
be
a
good
consideration
for
us
to
bear
in
mind
in
deciding
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
leaving
open
the
possibility
of
such
a
difficult
and
elaborate
proceeding?
we
know
perfectly
well
that
if
the
jurisdiction
is
exclusively
in
the
state
courts,
in
practical
terms
state
law
will
be
applied.
there
won't
be
the
potentiality
for
these
due
process
issues.
why
not
have
a
simple
highway
rule?
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
was
regulatory
sovereignty
and
then
that
was
legislative
sovereignty.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
may
i
go
back
to
a...
to
an
answer...
to
a
question
from
justice
kennedy?
you
said,
well,
even
if
congress
provided
by
statute
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
the
tribal
court
in...
in
this
case,
that
there
would...
there
would
or
could...
i'm
not
sure
which
you
said...
still
be
a
due
process
problem.
did
you
mean
by
that
simply
that
you
might
still
raise
a
due
process
challenge
to
the
particular
manner
in
which
the...
the
court
offices
were
appointed
or
the
jurors
selected
or
whatnot?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
a
related
question.
although
there's
been
a
speculation
about
due
process
horribles,
are
there...
do
you
have
any
documented
examples
that
anything
is
going
wrong
in
these
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
where...
where
would
i...
where
would
i...
where
could
i
properly
look
to
find
these
accounts?
is
the
case...
a
similar
case
being
considered
now
in
the
9th
circuit?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
i
don't
mean
to
belittle
that
case,
but
that
is
one
case.
do
we--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
we
have
any...
any
documentation
of
a
generalized
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
i...
is
there
a
law
report
or
something
that
i
can
read
to
find
these
examples?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
the
terms
of
the
easement
in
this
case
do
not
address
these
questions?
