argument
next
in

95-1872,
william
strate
v.
a-1
contractors
and
lyle
stockert.
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
get
outside
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
ms.
mccoy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
division
of
a
bundle
of
rights,
basically,
the
easement
giving
the
right
to
use
and
the
underlying
fee
being
the
rest,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did...
where
does
the
highway
end
up?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a...
because...
is
the
lake
a
resort?
i
mean,
why
does
the
highway
go
to
the
lake,
or
don't
you
know?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
marina
of
some
sorts
at
twin
buttes,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but...
and
one
gets
access
to
those
docks,
as
you
refer
to
them,
by
the
highway?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
dicta,
though,
was
it
not?
you
didn't
have
to
say
that
in
order
to
decide
the
question
that
the
court
took
the
case
to
decide.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mccoy.
mr.
nuechterlein.
mr.
nuechterlein,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
that
relates
to
the
discussion
we
were
just
having.
is
there...
if
tribal
court
jurisdiction
is
proper
here
between
the
two
non-indians,
and
if
the
tribal
court
were
in
the
subsequent
trial
to
apply
some
tribal
law
and
make
a
choice
of
law
that
it
was
going
to
look
to
tribal
law,
assuming
it
had
one,
is
there
any
way
later
that
that
could
be
challenged
by
the
losing
party
in
any
federal
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
really
want
to
slice
the
onion
this
many
ways
so
far
as
practical
effects
are
concerned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
the
least
desirable,
is
what
you
propose.
the
indian
tribal
court
should
first
decide
whether
there's
an
indian
interest
and
then
presumably
4
or
5
years
later
that
might
be
reviewed
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nuechterlein.
mr.
ward,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they're...
they're...
when
they
cross
the
line
from,
say,
north
dakota
into
montana,
they're
going
from
one
jurisdiction
into
another.
how
much
of
an
impression
do
you
think
that
makes
on
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it--
--but
they
shouldn't
be
based
on
whether
the
typical
motorist
has
respect
for
a
tribal
court
or
not,
i
don't
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--montana
talked
about
fee
land
in
the
sense
of
other
people
owning
it,
not
the
tribe
owning
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
members
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly...
certainly
our
cases
like
iowa
mutual
certainly
suggest
that
you
can...
not
only
suggest,
but
i
think
they
hold
you
can
come
into
federal
court--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
there
has
been
exhaustion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
lake
sakakawea,
is
that
a
corruption
of
sakajawea?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
