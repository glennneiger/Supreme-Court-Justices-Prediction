mr.
byron
l.
warnken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
maryland
asks
this
court
today
to
draw
a
bright
line
that
would
permit
a
compelled
detention
essentially
ultimately
equalling
perhaps
the
level
of
an
arrest
as
to
every
single
passenger
in
every
single
vehicle
in
every
single
circumstance
for
every
single
officer.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
souter,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
bright
line
should
not
be
drawn
there.
i
certainly
concede
of
the
various
places
on
the
continuum
that
would
be
probably
the
next
best
place
to
the
one
the
state
of
maryland
has
asked
for.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
souter,
i
think
that
would
be
different.
the
reason
that
would
be
different
is
that
in
the
arrest
scenario,
where
you
are
arresting
one
individual,
the
other
people
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
and
simply
you're
using
the
crowd
control
of
letting
them
not
join
where
you
are,
if
you
will.
but
here
we're
talking
something
different
in
that,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
this
individual
has
done
nothing
wrong.
this
individual
already--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
souter,
on
first
blush
it
may
appear
that
those
situations
are
similar.
i
think
the
reason
they
are
different
is
that
the
passenger,
once
being
made
to
get
out,
if
your
honors
draw
the
bright
line
there,
as
has
been
pointed
out
before,
the
police
will
push
that
limit
and,
in
fact,
once
you
have
the
valid
stop
of
that
vehicle,
united
states
v.
sharpe
and
numerous
other
cases
from
this
court
would
probably
permit
about
a
half-an-hour,
case-by-case
basis,
on
how
long
you
could
detain,
which
means,
your
honor,
that
making
the
passenger
get
out
would
have
the
functional
equivalent,
particularly
if
there
was
a
bright
line
and
the
police
could
do
anything
in
any
case,
allowing
the
passenger
to
be
detained,
even
though
it
started
as--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--if
this
court
were
to
draw
a
bright
line,
mr.
chief
justice,
wherein
the
only
authority
that
law
enforcement
had
as
to
the
passenger
when
there
is
no
evidence
of
officer
safety
issues
and
no
wrongdoing
on
the
passengers,
if
the
bright
line
were
only
to
require
that
individual
to
get
out
of
the
car
momentarily,
that
would
perhaps
be
permissible.
but,
your
honor,
once
we've
got
the
stop,
as
your
honor
points
out,
in
most
cases
the
individual
would
not
have
the
opportunity
to
walk
away.
it
simply
wouldn't--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--your
honor,
although
it
is
not
the
rule
we
are
asking
for,
i
concede
that
justice
souter's
drawing...
potential
drawing
of
the
bright
line
is
the
least
onerous
of
the
bright
lines
that
would
be
possible.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
absolutely
correct,
which
is
why,
your
honor,
we
have
urged
that
to
draw
a
bright
line
at
all
will
have
the
unintended
effect
of
overruling
terry
v.
ohio
and
its
progeny,
mr.
justice--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
scalia,
there
is
no
firm
information.
we
have
tried
to
obtain
training
manuals
from
various
jurisdictions,
and
it
seems
to
be
relatively
vague,
and
seems
to
extend
discretion
to
the
officer.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
ginsburg,
i
absolutely
agree
that
the
custom
and
usage
within
law
enforcement
agencies
is,
if
given
the
option,
to
not
have
the
people
get
out
of
the
car.
keep
the
people
in
the
car.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor...
justice
scalia,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
to
give
the
police
the
unfettered
standardless
discretion
is
the
problem.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
yes,
your
honor.
justice
scalia,
if
we
examine
the
case
law
we
already
have--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
kennedy,
that
is
correct,
in
that
there
is--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
kennedy,
let's
examine
the
continuum.
i
think
that
in
that
this
court
must
balance,
in
that
this
court
has
already
held
that
there
is
a
legitimate
and
weighty
interest
in
public
safety
for
the
officer,
that's
the
one
side
of
the
equation.
the
other
side
of
the
equation
for
balancing,
your
honors,
is
where
must
the
fourth
amendment
and
where
must
the
individual
interests
of
the
individual
be
balanced
to
accommodate
that
need.
and
what
we
are
saying,
your
honors,
is
that
the
one
place
this
court's
prior
case
law
would
not
let
that
line
be
drawn
and
the
one
place
reasonableness
would
not
be
accommodated,
would
be
to
draw
the
line
all
the
way
at
the
bottom,
saying--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
breyer,
one
of
the
potential
problems
with
that
as
the
law
is
that
brief
to
all
of
us
sounds
like,
stand
outside
for
a
few
moments,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
what
would
happen
would
be,
under
the
case
law
from
this
court,
that
will
pretty
much
defer
to
the
natural
steps
that
an
officer
must
take
to
effectuate
a
traffic
stop,
effectuate
an
arrest.
the
case
law
has
indicated
there
is
no
bright
line
on
time.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
breyer,
that
is...
that
is
my
line
on
this
case.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
your
honor,
i
was
saying
justice
scalia,
in
this
case--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--because
we
already
have
plenty
of
case
law
that
if
there
is
any
evidence
of
officer
safety,
if
there
is
any
evidence
of--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
ginsburg,
you
are
correct
on
both
counts.
that
is
to
say,
the
judge
held
it
not
to
be
sufficient
here,
but
i
certainly
agree
with
your
honor's
implicit
statement
as
part
of
that
that
on
this
record--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
ginsburg,
i
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
that
would
be
insufficient,
because,
your
honor,
if
the
trial
judge
had
on
this
record
determined
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
under
terry
v.
ohio
and
its
progeny,
on
this
record,
probably
on
appeal
that
would
not
have
been
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
kennedy,
this
court
can
easily
paint...
draw
a
line
to
fashion
a
rule
that
will
fully
accommodate
the
legitimate
and
weighty
interest
of
government
in
the
safety
of
officers
and
still
balance
fourth
amendment
interests
of
the
individual.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
ginsburg,
ever
since
terry
v.
ohio
and
its
progeny,
that's
what
we
have
had,
and
yet
the
states,
the
officers,
the
courts
have
not
had
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct,
but
the
reason
mimms
is
a
bright
line
rule
is
a
combination
of
officer
safety
and
the
valid
underlying
stop
of
the
driver.
mimms
really
requires
the
both
of
them
in
order
to
work.
this,
your
honors,
would
be
i
believe
the
first
time
this
court
would
ever
draw
this
type
of
bright
line.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
souter,
my
answer
to
justice
kennedy
must
be
taken
in
the
context
of
where
i
think
this
court
should
fashion
a
rule.
i'm
suggesting
to
your
honors
that
if
there
is,
on
the
limited
circumstances
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
officer
safety,
and
where
there
is
no--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--that
is
correct,
and
again,
this
court
has
deferred
to
the
first
level
fact-finders.
if
the
fact-finder
finds
that
there
is
on
that
record
no
evidence
of
officer
safety,
no
evidence
of
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
or
administrative
wrongdoing,
then
the
best
place
to
draw
the
line,
i
believe,
is
the
fourth
amendment
would
be
violated
to
intrude
upon
the
passengers.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
souter,
the
officer
probably
would
have
that
authority,
because,
your
honor,
in
the
alternative
to
our
asking
you
to
draw
no
bright
line
at
all,
what
this
court
could
do
to
fashion
the
rule
would
be
to
say,
all
of
our
continuing
case
law
exists
wherever
we
have
any
evidence
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
fear
of
officer
safety,
and
in
addition,
we
will
do
as
we
did
in
cases
like
florida
v.
wells
and
united
states
v.
sokolow.
we
will
say
that
even
when
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
record,
we
will
defer
to
the
expertise
of
administrative
agencies,
law
enforcement
agencies
in
a
profile-type
situation.
if,
based
upon
their
experience,
a
certain
set
of
scenarios
does
cause
what
many
courts
have
referred
to
as
the
heightened
caution,
the
heightened
caution
may
be--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
o'connor,
you
are
correct.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
o'connor,
i...
as
to
your
last
part
of
your
question,
i
cannot,
and
that
is
because
the
way
the
statistics
appear
to
be
maintained
on
a
national
level,
it
includes
all
types
of
situations
such
as
stops
as
well
as
pursuits.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
o'connor--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
o'connor,
you're
absolutely
correct,
there
are
a
number
of
jurisdictions,
as
general
curran
pointed
out--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--that
believe
that
your
earlier
decision--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--in
mimms
was
extended
to--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
o'connor,
you're
correct
that
there's
no
hard
evidence
as
to
one
way
or
the
other.
there
is
no
hard
evidence
that
having
the
power
since
mimms
has
caused
officer
safety
to
be
affected
negatively
or
positively
or
not
affected
at
all.
your
honor,
this
court's
dicta
in
michigan
v.
long
was
just
that.
the
court
had
before
it
a
very
different
context,
determining
whether,
when
you
had
not
only
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity
but
you
also
had
reasonable
suspicion
of
armed
and
dangerous.
in
that
scenario,
the
court
was
merely
addressing
what
would
be
the
scope
of
that
armed
and
dangerous,
and
the
court
adopted
the
rationale
from
belton
to
say
that
it
would
be
the
lunge,
reach
and
grasp.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
and
justice--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--justice
scalia,
he
may
or
may
not
be
a
totally
innocent
person.
he's
certainly
not
a
total
stranger
in
most
cases,
as
your
honor
just
correctly
pointed
out.
i
dare
say
that
probably
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
the
people
in
this
room
within
the
last
3
to
4
hours
have
been
either
a
driver
or
a
passenger
in
a
public
or
private
conveyance,
and
i
think
when
we
get
in
a
vehicle
as
a
passenger
we
certainly
have
an
expectation
that
in
the
event
that
the
driver
were
to
violate
a
traffic
rule
or
regulation
that
in
fact
that
vehicle
will
be
stopped.
what
we
don't
have
is
an
expectation
that
we
can
be
compelled,
demanded
to
get
out
of
the
vehicle
and,
were
we
to
resist
that,
we
could
be
forcibly
taken
from
the
vehicle.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
mr.
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia,
that
we
do
have
an
expectation--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--we
do
have
an
expectation
that
we
will
not
be
arrested,
and
i
think
if
you
have
unfettered
discretion,
standardless
discretion,
no
requirement
as
in
wells
or
sokolow
that
the
agency
promulgate
any,
some
guidance
to
its
officers,
you
may
well
have
the
equivalent
of
dunaway
v.
new
york,
where
this
court
has
to
say
that
the
way
an
individual
has
been
forcibly
detained
would
become
the
equivalent
of
an
arrest.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
example
you
give
and
the
example
many
members
of
this
court
have
given
proves
the
very
point
that
justice
stevens
noted
in
his
dissent
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
and
that
is,
passengers
are
not
fungible
goods.
there
are
a
myriad
of
situations,
and
in
fact
we
probably
have...
and
we
cite
the
statistics
in
our
brief
as
to
how
we
get
to
this
number,
but
you
probably
have
about
25
millionish
passengers
in
this
country
per
year
who
are,
in
fact,
in
a
vehicle
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
officer
safety
and
no
evidence
of
any
wrongdoing
other
than
a
traffic
violation
of
the
driver,
and
that
is
why--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--your
honor,
as
we
conceded
in
our
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
an
interpolation,
taking...
using
maryland
as
a
state
where
statistically
it
does
have
1/50th
of
the
population,
5
million
out
of
250
million,
and
taking
the
number
of
traffic
cases
that
actually
get
as
far
as
court
to
be
docketed,
and
then
assuming,
as
we
did
in
our
brief,
that
on
the
average
there
would
be
a
passenger
in
a
car
probably
one
time
out
of
two.
and
of
course
our
numbers
could
be
wrong,
but
the
point
is,
it
shows
the
extent
to
which
the
single
biggest
probably
police-citizen
encounter
in
our
society
today
is
a
vehicle.
we
don't
have
the
officer
that
walks
the
beat.
we
don't
have
the
constable
in
the
way
we
once
did,
and
most
of
us,
when
we
next
meet
a
law
enforcement
officer
when
that
individual
is
in
the
line
of
duty,
it
will
be
when
we
are
driver
or
a
passenger
in
a
vehicle.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
stevens,
that's
correct.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
stevens
and
justice
souter,
i
certainly
concede
to
this
court
that
were
this
court
to
fashion
a
rule
saying,
state
of
maryland,
we
reject
your
absolute,
bright
line,
unlimited,
unfettered
discretion
in
all
circumstances,
but
we
will
draw
a
line
that
would
permit
unfettered
discretion,
meaning
a
bright
line
to
the
limited
extent
of
having
the
passenger
exit
the
vehicle,
and
then
the
passenger
having
the
complete
discretion
whether
to
get
back
into
the
vehicle,
whether
to
leave,
or
any
other
reasonable
steps
the
officer
would
take--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
case
law
from
this
court
already
would
probably
give
an
officer,
if
that
officer
had
reason
to
believe
that
an
individual
were
a
witness
to
the
crime,
to
try
to
seek
that
information.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
o'connor,
that
is
correct,
which
is
why
i
stated
earlier
that
this
court
could
fashion
a
line
between
the
one
end
of
the
spectrum
that
we
would
like
to
see,
which
is,
you
need
reasonable
suspicion
in
each
case,
and
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
that
the
state
of
maryland
asks
for,
which
is,
you
need
nothing
and
anything,
to
say,
the
line
is
as
follows:
our
existing
case
law
applies.
any
reasonable
suspicion
of
any
wrong
activity
or
officer's
safety,
of
course
the
officer
can
then
take
reasonable
steps;
in
addition,
take
all
of
these
hypos
that
we
discussed
today
and
defer
that
back
to
the
law
enforcement
agencies
for
them,
based
upon
their
expertise,
just
like
you
did
in
sokolow,
just
like
you
did
in
wells,
for
them
to
say,
based
upon
their
experience
as
experts
in
the
area,
what
are
the
kinds
of
situations
that
truly
create
a
heightened
caution
that
would
permit
some
type
of
activity,
notwithstanding
the
failure
to
have
any
facts
in
that
particular
case.
and
in
fact
that's
what
this
court
did
when
this
court
ruled
unanimously
in
wells
that
it
was
not
proper
to
do
an
inventory
search
when
there
was
simply
no
guidance
from
the
agency
to
the
individual
officers.
this
court
referred
it
back,
and
since
then
agencies
have
had
no
problem
examining
those
scenarios
and
coming
up
with
situations
just
like
agencies
have
since
sokolow
in
the
profile
cases.
what
are
the
kinds
of
situations,
based
on
its
experience
as
a
law
enforcement
agency,
that
makes
it
reasonable
in
the
following
circumstances,
following
types
of
situations,
the
following
is
likely?
this
court
has
consistently
given
deference
to
administrative
agencies,
their
expertise
in
the
area,
and
we
are
not
suggesting
that
be
any
different.
what
we
are
suggesting,
your
honor,
is,
when
you
weigh
out
the
interest
of
law
enforcement
and
safety
and
you
weigh
out
individual
rights,
you
can't
give
standardless,
unlimited
discretion
to
individual
officers.
the
best
you
should
do
is
to
give
that
discretion
to
administrative
agencies.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
probably
correct.
this
court
has
recognized
the
50
little
laboratories,
and
we
know
that
in
inventory
search
cases,
we
know
that
in
profile
cases,
basically
that's
what
this
court
has
done
now.
it
has
said
that
even
though
you
don't
have
anything
individualized
in
that
case,
if
you
can
draw
us--
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
--it...
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
if
your
honors
were
to
draw
the
line,
for
example
where
justice
souter
was
suggesting
earlier,
or
raising
as
a
possibility
earlier,
of
simply
exiting,
and
then
if
this
court
later
decided
that
in
fact
that
was
such
as
to
be
reasonable,
then
in
fact
that
would
be
permissible.
but
of
course,
your
honor,
these
standards
that
would
be
made
by
agencies,
just
like
the
profile
cases
today,
would,
of
course,
be
subject
to
review
as
to
whether
they
were
unreasonable
and
extended
too
much
or
not
sufficient
guidance
to
individual
officers.
officer
safety
is
at
issue,
but
it
cannot
take
all
fourth
amendment
rights
away.
mr.
byron
l.
warnken
thank
you,
your
honors.
