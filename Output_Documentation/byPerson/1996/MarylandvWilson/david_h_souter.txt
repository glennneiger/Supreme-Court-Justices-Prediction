justice
david
h.
souter
general,
as
you
have
put
the
case,
you
really
just
want
the
officer
to
have
the
opportunity
to
exercise
judgment
in
deciding
whether
the
passenger
ought
to
get
out
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
terry
give
you
the
authority
for
that?
i
assume,
for
example,
that
in
this
case
under
the
principles
of
terry,
with
all
the
movement
of
the
car,
the
ducking
around
and
so
on,
that
the
officer
probably
would
have
had
the
authority
at
least
to
go
as
far
as
terry
would
have
let
him
go
in
asking
or
satisfying
himself
that
the
passenger
wasn't
a
danger.
why
isn't
terry
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
officer
was
going
to
exercise
judgment,
and
if
your
argument
now
is
that
he
doesn't
have
to
wait
for
some
indication
of
risk,
then
i
think
you're
really
saying
the
officer
as
a
routine
matter
is
going
to
order
every
passenger
out
of
the
car,
so
i
think
that's
a
difference
in
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
terry
enough?
i
mean,
your
argument
is
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
size
up
the
situation.
terry
gives
him
a
chance
to
size
up
the
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
i
think
what
you're
really
arguing,
and
i
think
this
was
what
the
attorney
general
from
maryland
was
really
arguing,
is
you
really
don't
so
much
want
him
to
size
up
the
situation.
you
simply
want
to
have
the
right
to
get
him
out
of
the
car,
period.
it's
not
going
to
be
a
question
of
judgment.
it's
going
to
be
a
question
of
routine
practice,
i
assume.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
question
on
something
that
frankly
i
think
i
should
have
done
some
looking
into
before
i
came
on
the
bench,
but
i
didn't.
has
this
court
ever
ruled
on
the
authority
of
an
officer
to
control
members
of
the
public
generally
when
making,
let's
say,
an
arrest
in
a
public
place?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not,
either.
there
may
not
be
one.
there
are
holdings,
are
there
not,
on
control
of
a
crime
scene,
to
require
people
to
stay
away
while
they
assemble
evidence
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
do
not
adopt
the
rule
that
goes
as
far
as
you
have
just
suggested
it
should,
that...
let's
assume
our...
under
our
rule,
once
the
passenger
is
out
of
the
car,
if
the
passenger
wants
to
go,
he
can.
if
that
is
the
limit
of
the
detention
allowed,
is
the
situation
of
the
passenger
in
any
significantly
different...
is
the
situation
of
the
passenger
significantly
different
from
that
of
a
bystander
in
the
course
of
a
public
arrest
somewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
warnken,
may
i
just
ask
you
the
same
question
that
i
asked
ms.
reno?
let's
assume
that
the
bright
line
rule
allowed
nothing
more
than
requiring
the
passenger
to
get
out
of
the
car
so
that
if
the
passenger
then
said,
i've
had
enough
of
this,
i'm
leaving,
the
passenger,
so
far
as
the
bright
line
rule
is
concerned,
would
be
allowed
to
go.
assume
that.
in
fact,
the
passenger
says,
thank
goodness.
this
guy
was
speeding.
i
am
so
glad
to
get
out
of
this
car.
[laughter]
let
me
catch
the
nearest
cab
and
go--
--you
can
see
what
justice
scalia's
passengers
tend
to
feel
like.
assuming
that
justice
scalia
is
the
one
who
has
been
stopped
and
it's
his
passenger--
--who
is
then
free
to
go,
would
the
bright
line
rule
simply
allowing
the
officer
to
say,
get
out,
give
the
officer
any
greater
authority
than
the
officer
has
in
the
case
of
sort
of
the
public
arrest,
in
which
people
are
congregating
around
and
the
officer
says,
stay
back,
or
get
away,
or
something
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
responds
to
my
question,
because
my
question
is,
if
the
bright
line
would
allow
the
officer
to
go
no
further
than
to
say
either
get
out
or
stay
in,
would
the
officer
have
any...
be
having
any
greater
authority
there
than
the
officer
presumably
does
when
making
a
public
arrest,
in
which
he
is
allowed
to
control
bystanders
in
the
crowd
by
telling
them
to
stay
away?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
the
case
of
the
public
arrest
the
person
who
is
being
told
to
stay
back
12
feet
would
normally...
has
done
nothing
wrong
and
would
normally
be
able
to
walk
up
and
down
the
sidewalk.
that
person
can
go
back
the
12
feet
or
whatever
and
say,
i
don't
want
to
stay
here
any
longer,
and
walk
away,
but
at
least
within
a
certain
zone
in
which
the
officer
is
operating,
the
officer
can
control
people
who
come
along,
and
those
people
who
come
along
are
no
more
or
less
innocent,
i
suppose,
than
the
passenger,
so
why
shouldn't
the
passenger
be
in
the
same
boat
with
the
bystander?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
might
be
the
first
time
that
we
did
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
much
of
an
innovation,
if
at
all,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
you're
making,
and
in
particular
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
last
question,
you're
saying
in
effect
that
an
officer
who
stops
a
car
on
a
highway
has
less
capacity
to
control
the
people
around
him
who
might
hurt
him
or
interfere
with
what
he
is
validly
doing
than
he
does
if
he
makes
an
arrest
in
a
public
shopping
mall.
and
if
i'm
wrong,
tell
me,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
said
he
couldn't
make
him
stay
in
the
car,
he
couldn't
make
the
passenger
get
out
of
the
car,
the
passenger
basically
would
have
total
freedom...
in
the
absence
of
a
terry
suspicion,
articulable
suspicion,
the
passenger
would
have
total
freedom
to
decide
what
to
do.
if
i'm
walking
down
the
street
outside
this
court
and
an
arrest
is
going
on,
i
presume
i
don't
have
complete
autonomy
to
decide
whether
to
walk
up
to
the
officer
or
between
the
officer
and
the
person
who's
getting
arrested
and
circle
the
scene,
so
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
on
your
answer
the
officer
is
in
a
worse
position
if
he
stops
a
car
on
the
highway
than
if
he
makes
an
arrest
on
the
sidewalk?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
terry
suspicion,
in
other
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let's
assume
we've
got
an
arrest
going
on
on
the
sidewalk,
and
i
used
to
be
an
attorney
general,
now
i'm
a
judge.
i'm
interested
in
how
these
things
work,
so
i
want
to
get
right
up
close
and
hear
exactly
what's
being
said
between
the
officer
and
the
person
being
arrested,
so
i
walk
up
within
2
feet
of
what's
going
on.
does
the
officer,
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment,
at
that
point
have
the
authority
to
say,
uhoh,
it's
souter.
[laughter]
let's
get
him
back
where
he
isn't
going
to
mess
things
up.
doesn't
the
officer,
consistently
with
the
fourth
amendment,
have
the
authority
to
tell
me
to
get
back
6
feet?
