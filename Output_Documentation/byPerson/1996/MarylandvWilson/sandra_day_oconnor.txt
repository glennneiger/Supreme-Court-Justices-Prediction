how
far
does
the
authority
extend?
would
you
say
that
the
passenger
would
be
free
to
leave
if
the
passenger
chose
after
exiting
the
car
at
the
officer's
request?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
want
more
than
the
right
to
require
the
passenger
to
exit.
you
want
to
require
the
passenger
to
be
detained.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
how
long?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
be
searched?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
be
asked
any
questions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there
is
a
difference.
i
mean,
the
driver
was
stopped
because
there
was
reason
to
believe
he
had
violated
a
traffic
law,
or
requirement,
that
the
driver
was
speeding
while
making
an
illegal
turn,
or
without
a
license
on
the
car,
or
whatever.
but
there
is
no
such
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
passenger,
who
was
not
driving
the
car,
and
i
don't
think
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
which
says
yes,
you
can
require
the
driver
to
step
out
and
wait
until
the
ticket
is
issued
or
a
resolution
is
made
on
that
question,
but
i'm
just
not
sure
what
the
authority
is
for
detaining
a
passenger
who
is
required
to
step
out.
the
passenger
is
not
suspected
of
an
illegal
driving
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
nevertheless
they
had
a
right
to
stop
the
car
because
it
was
an
alleged
traffic
violation
by
the
driver,
isn't
that
so,
otherwise
they
couldn't
have
stopped
the
car
at
all,
presumably.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
that
reason
does
not
apply
to
the
passenger,
so
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
is
your
authority
for
claiming
the
right
not
only
to
require
the
passenger
to
exit,
but
to
detain
the
passenger.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
necessarily.
suppose
it's
a
driving
snowstorm,
or
a
blinding
rainstorm,
the
passenger
is
a
mother
with
a
very
young
baby,
and
the
officer
automatically
can
order
her
out
of
the
car,
to
put
the
baby
down
outside
where
he
can
see
the
baby
and
raise
her
hands
up,
and
real
damage
can
occur,
and
there
is
no
reason
that
the
car
was
stopped
because
of
what
that
passenger
was
doing
under
the
circumstances
here.
now,
maybe
an
officer
can
see
a
passenger
in
the
car
holding
a
gun.
well,
that's
a
different
situation,
isn't
it.
but
is
there
any...
and
suppose
the
court
thinks
there
is
a
real
difference
between
the
driver
and
the
passenger
in
that
the
driver
can
be
stopped
for
what
the
officer
perceives
is
a
traffic
violation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
just
one
example
and
you
want
an
automatic
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
suppose
the
passenger
has
certain
dementia.
it's
an
old
parent
who,
left
to
his
own,
will
just
wander
away
and
not
even
understand
what
was
being
said
to
him,
but
automatically
you're
going
to
get
this
passenger
out
and
require
him
to
stay,
and
if
he
doesn't
understand,
shoot
him.
[laughter]
you
know.
i
just...
this
can
be
carried
to
extremes,
and
you
seem
to
don't
even
recognize
that
there
might
be
a
difference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
my
understanding
was
that
you
want
a
holding
that
lets
the
officer
at
the
officer's
discretion
require
all
parties
to
exit
or
no
parties
to
exit,
but
if
he
wants
all
parties
to
exit,
they
must,
and
you
want
the
right,
then,
to
detain
the
passengers
who
have
exited.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
all
right,
but
the
fourth
amendment,
after
all,
is
based
on
reasonableness.
that's
been
the
requirement
all
along,
and
should
there
be
no
reasonableness
requirement
on
the
matter
of
detaining
passengers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
circumstances
where
it
isn't
a
de
minimis
intrusion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
warnken,
this
court
itself
in
dicta
in
michigan
v.
long
referred
to
the
right
of
officers
to
require
all
persons
in
a
vehicle
to
exit,
and
many
courts
around
the
nation
have
similarly
thought
that
it...
the
mimms
principle
extends
to
everyone
in
a
vehicle
at
a
traffic
stop
at
least
to
get
them
out
if
the
officer
wants
to
get
them
out
of
the
vehicle.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
addressed
the
additional
argument
raised
here
by
maryland
that
it
also
includes
a
right
to
detain.
i
don't
think
that
has
been
addressed,
really,
has
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
had
any
particular
problems
with
the
many
jurisdictions
that
say
mimms
does
allow
an
officer
to
require
everyone
to
get
out?
have
there
been
problems
you
can
refer
to,
or
statistics
that
you
can
indicate
that
this
is
a
worse
situation
in
such
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
admit
that
many
jurisdictions
have
followed
what
this
court
at
least
said
in
dicta
in
michigan
v.
long
and
allowed
officers
to
order
people
out--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
a
traffic
stop.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
doesn't
appear
to
have
offered
any
particular
problems.
i
think
what
really
troubles
me
is
the
point
about
how
long
can
such
a
passenger
be
detained?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
getting
identification
of
who
the
passenger
is
and
where
they
could
be
reached
if
they're
needed
to
be
a
witness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we're
talking
about
a
traffic
stop.
obviously,
the
passenger
is
a
witness
to
speeding,
or
making
a
wrong
turn,
or
something
like
that.
