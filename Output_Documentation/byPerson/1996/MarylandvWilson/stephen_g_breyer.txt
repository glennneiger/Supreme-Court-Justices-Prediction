g.

everybody
agrees
with
that.
i
just...
everybody
agrees
with
that,
but
the
question
is
the
risk
of
abuse.
now,
i
notice
in
the
opinion,
but
i...
maybe
it's
in
the
briefs
and
i
didn't
see
it...
it
says
several
jurisdictions
already
have
extended
mimms
to
passengers.
is
there
any
indication
that
there
are
any
of
these
problems,
or
there
are
not
these
problems,
in
the
other
jurisdictions
that
have
already
adopted
the
rule
that
you
want?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
to
look
at
those.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
to
look
those
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
another
question
which
i
wanted
to
ask,
which
is
that
i
didn't
know
until
this
argument
that
you
are
suggesting
that
the
police
should
have
the
right
to
detain
the
passenger.
i
thought
that
you
were...
after...
suppose
the
passenger
gets
out
of
the
car,
and
the
policeman
asks
him
to,
and
then
he
says,
i'm
fed
up
with
this.
i
want
to
take
a
bus.
and
the
bus
goes
along,
and
he
takes
it.
are
you
arguing
that
the
policeman
should
be
free
to
tell
him
no,
you
can't
take
the
bus?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is...
i
didn't
find
that
in
your
brief,
and
i
don't
know
what
the
rationale
for
that
would
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
attorney
general's
view?
what
i
heard
her
say
was
a
brief,
temporary
stop.
i.e.,
you
can
tell
the
passenger
to
stay
inside,
you
can
tell
the
passenger
can
come
out,
as
long
as
it's
brief
and
temporary.
i
mean,
i
take
it...
i
don't
know
the
minutes.
it
sounded
like
minutes,
not
30
minutes.
it
sounded
like
the
time
it
takes
to
write
up
a
traffic
ticket.
what
about
that
as
a
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
your
line,
then?
your
line...
is
your
line
that
if
the
man
who
is
the
passenger
wants
to
stay
in
the
car
he
can
do
it,
regardless?
if
he
wants
to
get
out
of
the
car,
he
can
do
it,
regardless.
is
that
your
line?
