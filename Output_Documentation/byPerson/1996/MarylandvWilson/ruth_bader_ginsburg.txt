justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
curran,
are
you
saying
that
if
the
officer
made
the
decision
to
keep
the
person
inside,
it
would
be
the
officer's
call,
too?
suppose
a
passenger
says,
i
want
out.
i'm
going
to
take
a
car
and
go
home...
take
a
cab
and
go
home.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
curran,
you
did
say
that
it
would
only
be
to
show
his
hands,
that
he
could
not
be
frisked.
the
officer
could
not
question
the
passenger
without
the
passenger's
consent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
once
he
shows
his
hands,
then
he
can
walk
away
and
hail
a
cab?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
can
he
do,
then?
can
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
he
just
has
to
stand
there.
he
can't
be
questioned
and
he
can't
be
frisked,
but
he's
not
free
to
leave
until
the
officer
says,
okay,
i'm
done,
you
can
go.
that's
the
rule
you
want.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
reno,
you
are
arguing
for
a
bright
line
test,
and
i'm
wondering
how
that
squares
with
the
very
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
robinette,
which
said
that
reasonableness
is
always
case-by-case
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
yet
here
you're
saying
that
it's
reasonable
in
any
and
all
circumstances
for
the
police
officer
to
say,
everybody
out,
or
everybody
in.
that
doesn't
go
case-by-case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warnken,
i
think
that
general
curran
told
us
that
the
more
usual
practice
is
to
tell
the
people
you
must
stay
inside.
are
you
disputing
that
that's
so
in
the
cases
that
give
the
officer
the
option?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
that
any
evidence?
i
mean,
here
there
was
evidence
that
the
officer
testified
i
saw
the
passenger,
and
even
more
so
the
person
in
the
back
seat,
ducking,
bobbing
up
and
down
and
making
suspicious
movements.
that
was
held
by
the
trial
judge,
or
at
least
some
judge
in
maryland
to
be
insufficient
to
allow
for
a
terry
stop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
would
like
to
know
what
would
be
sufficient,
since
you
said
that
a
passenger
fidgeting,
ducking,
making
ducking
motions,
that
wouldn't
be
sufficient.
what
would
be
sufficient
to
allow
the
officer
to
apprehend
the
passenger?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
told
me--
--you
mean
terry--
--it
would
be
case...
it
would
be
judge
by
judge,
that
on
this
very
record
one
judge
might
have
said,
that's
enough
for
terry,
and
another
judge
might
have
said,
no
it
isn't,
and
we
would
have
this
diversity
in
practice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
one
expect
to
be
some
kind
of
witness
to
what
occurred?
for
example,
one
would
have
knowledge
whether
the
driver
had
a
seat
belt,
whether
the
driver
was
engaged
in
conversation...
one
would
be
a
witness
to
what
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
might
be
different
in
every
state,
and
suppose...
are
you
saying
that
if
maryland
had
a
manual
and
said,
after
5:00
p.m.,
it's
beginning
to
get
dark,
the
officer
at
that
time
can
order
the
passenger
out,
and
then
if
they
had
that
rule,
then
we
would
defer
to
it
and
your
client
would
legitimately
have
been
asked
to
get
out
because
it
was
after
5:00?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
would
mean
that
if
that's
what
your
answer
is,
that
all
they
need
is
a
manual
that
says
after
5:00
this
is
okay,
then
the
next
client
like
yours
loses,
because
in...
with
your
client
it
wasn't
a
question
of
detention.
when
your
client
exited
the
car
the
contraband
exited
with
him,
right?
