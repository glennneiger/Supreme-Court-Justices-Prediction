mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
nearly
20
years
ago
this
court
held
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
v.
mimms
that
it
was
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
a
police
officer
in
making
a
car
stop
for
a
traffic
violation
to
require
the
driver
to
exit
the
car.
the
risk
to
the
officer
is
such
in
these
stops
that
it
was
also
permitted
for
the
officer
to
request
the
driver
to
get
out
without
any
suspicion
that
the
driver
would
pose
a
danger
to
the
officer.
the
latest
figures
that
we
have
available
demonstrate
that
the
risks
are
real
to
police
officers
in
traffic
stops.
the
latest
figures
in
1994
show
that
5,762
police
officers
were
assaulted
in
traffic
stops.
indeed,
since
the
decision
in
mimms
there
have
been
over
200
police
officers
slain
in
traffic
stops.
because
passengers,
like
drivers,
have--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--the...
yes.
yes,
justice--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--well,
there
were
a
total
of
some
52,000
assaults
during
that
given
year,
'94,
of
which
5,700
were
in
traffic
stops.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
those
are
figures
are
not
available--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
well,
justice
stevens,
the
typical
practice,
and
i
can
refer
to
maryland,
of
course,
but
i
believe
the
briefs
will
show
the
typical
practice
is
to
control
the
risk.
that's
what
the
training
is,
to
control
the
risk,
and
typically
they
keep
the
driver
and
the
passenger
in
the
car.
however,
having
said
that,
as
the
new
york
v.
class
case
indicated,
there
is
this
discretion
the
officer
can
use,
and
what
we're
asking,
of
course,
is
the
automatic
rule
for
that
discretion
to
be
utilized
in
the
wilson
case,
as
this
court
granted
in
the
mimms
case.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
we
want
the
officer
to
be
able
to
require
the
passenger
to
get
out
or,
where
it's
appropriate,
to
stay
in,
and
in
order
to
control
the
stop
the
officer
should
be
able
to
control
the
location
of
the
passenger,
and
the
location
can
be
outside
the
car,
or
it
could
be,
in
an
appropriate
case,
inside
the
car.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
take
that
position.
we
want
the
officer
to
be
able
to
control
the
risk,
control
the
location.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--we
want...
there
is
no
time
frame
as...
i
can
tell
you
what
the
typical
stop--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
not
a
frisk.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
could
be
asked,
but
not
required
to
answer.
to
get
out,
to
step
aside,
to
show
your
hands.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
within
what
is
typically
10,
or
at
the
outside
20
minutes.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
he
could.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
the
officer
has
to...
mr.
chief
justice,
the
officer
has
to
be
able
to
control
the
stop,
to
complete
safely
the
transaction,
getting
the
information
from
the
driver,
the
registration,
the
license,
et
cetera,
and
in
order
to
do
that
safely,
he
needs
to
be
able
to
know
where
any
potential
danger
to
him
or
her
lies.
controlling
the
location
of,
in
this
case
mr.
wilson,
would
have
been
the
appropriate
way
to
do
that.
he
could
have
seen
that
he
did
not
pose
a
particular
danger
by
seeing
his
hands.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
balancing
that
this
court
went
through
in
mimms
is
really
the
same
for
the
mr.
wilsons,
the
passengers.
there
is
this
compelling
governmental
interest
of
police
safety,
which
has
been
acknowledged,
against
what
is
a
de
minimis
intrusion
against
mr.
wilson,
where
there
has
already
been
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
by
being
in
the
car
in
the
first
place.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
well,
michigan
and
summers,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--sir?
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
to
control
the
safe
completion
of,
in
that
case
the
search
of
the
house,
he
had
to
have
the
ability
to
make
certain
that
he
could
safely
and
successfully
complete
the
search,
and
the
same
weight
goes
here.
the--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
it's
the
mimms
decision
that
required
the
driver
to
exit
not
because
in
this
case
he
was
speeding,
as
was
the
probable
cause,
or
not
because
there
was
a
faulty
tag,
but
because
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
potential
danger,
and
so
for
the
reason
that
they
wanted...
police
safety
was
the
reason
mimms
got
out
of
the
car,
not
because
there
was--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
when
there
was
a
stop
of
the
mimms
car
or
the
wilson
car
by
virtue
of
physics
both
are
seized,
or
both
are
detained,
so
there
the
driver
and
the
passenger
are
identical.
they're
both
seized.
they're
both
stopped.
if,
in
fact,
the
rationale
of
mimms
is
to
be
conveyed
to
the
passenger,
the
safety
of
the
officer,
it
is
equally
apparent
that
the
passenger
would
have
had
much...
just
as
much
access
to
the
gun
as
mr.
mimms
would
have
had.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
that
would
happen
now
in
mimms,
because
without
any
discretion,
or
any
guidelines,
the
officer
now
may
in
that
case
require
someone
to
exit.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
and
for
the
same--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
proposal
that
we
have,
and
the
rationale
being
that
the
order
out
in
mimms
was
not
because
of
the
traffic
violation
but
because
of
the
finding
that
there
is...
there's
a
compelling
reason
for
police
safety
to
require
the
officer
to
make
that--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
privacy
interests
of
the
driver
and
the
passenger
are
identical.
however,
if
the
court
should
so
find
that
there
is
a
minor
privacy
interest
difference,
notwithstanding,
there
still
is...
as
far
as
the
passenger
is
concerned
he
already
has
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy,
and
with
that
diminished
expectation
of
privacy,
we're
talking
about
a
very
diminished
intrusion.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
see
the
point
you're
trying
to
raise,
and
obviously
the
question
of
a
baby
and
a
yound
mother
out
in
the
rain
is
obviously
not--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do
want
the
automatic
rule,
and
i
might
add,
the
same--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
with
respect,
justice
scalia--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
appreciate
the
question.
that
same
scenario,
of
course,
could
happen
under
mimms,
and
mimms
has
now
been
with
us
for
19,
almost--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--well,
i
obviously
have.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
i
obviously
have
a
concern.
the
point
we're
making,
though,
is
that
removing
a
driver
doesn't
eliminate
the
danger
that
we
talked
about
in
mimms.
the
passenger
has
equal
access
to
the
same
revolver
that
mr.
mimms
would
have
had,
so
removing
the
driver
does
not
eliminate
the
problem.
yes,
i
admit,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--i
do
understand,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
a
difference.
i'm
simply
suggesting
this,
that
removing
the
driver
does
not
remove
the
danger.
in
fact--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
am
not
able
to
say
that
i
have
researched
the
cases
in
the
other
jurisdictions,
but
indeed
i
will
tell
you
that
there
are
a
majority...
there
are
20
states
that
have
ruled
the
way
maryland
wishes
to
rule,
and
there
are
five...
including
the
district
of
columbia,
so
there
are
21
areas,
including
there
are
five,
four
or
five
federal
circuit
courts,
mostly
in
the--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--there
is
a--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--a
substantial
majority
have
ruled
this
way.
there's
five
that
have
ruled
against
us,
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
it
is
in
our
brief
and
in
our
argument
in
terms
of
the
ability
to
control,
your
honor,
the
location.
the
individual
may
say,
i
wish
to
take
a
bus
and
go
elsewhere.
the
officer
need
not
accept
that
as
real.
the
officer
is
still
concerned
about
his
genuine
safety,
and
the
only
way
he
can
really
make
certain
it
is
a
safe
stop
is
to
control
the
location--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
our
rule
would
ask
the
passenger
to
get
out,
to
stand
in
a
certain
location
described
by
the
officer,
to
show
his
hands,
and
to
remain
there
for
the
10
minutes
while
the
information
is
obtained
about
the
license
and
the
registration.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
or
the
officer
may,
with
discretion,
as
we've
talked
about
in
class,
permit
the
passenger
to
remain
in
the
car.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
your
honor,
we
would
have
thought
that
there
was
justification
for
a
reasonable
suspicion
in
the
wilson
case.
however,
we
don't
believe
it's
appropriate
to
have
the
officer
try
to
wait
for
some
level
of
risk
to
arise
if
he
or
she
waits--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--i'm
not
so
sure
that's
the
case,
justice
souter,
because
as
i
say,
the
typical
training
in
our
manual,
which
indicates...
and
i
believe
it's
typical
across
the
nation...
is
to
require
both
the
driver
and
the
passenger
to
remain
in
the
car.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
for
this
minimal--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--we
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
reasonableness
factor
is
best
weighed
by
the
balancing
test
that
the
court
has
used
again
and
again,
the
high
governmental
interest
against
this
minimal
intrusion
against
what
is
already
a
de
minimis
privacy
expectation
of
the
passenger.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
be
permitted
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
may
i
answer,
chief
justice--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
you
are
right,
we
don't
have
the
specific
numbers,
but
may
i
infer
from
information
we
do
have.
since
mimms,
with
the
authority
upheld
for
the
police
across
the
nation
to
order
the
driver
out,
and
since
some
25
jurisdictions
have
believed
that
mimms
also
conveys
to
the
passengers,
we
do
have
data
that
shows
that
the
percentage
of
deaths
in
traffic
incidents
have
been
reduced
from
about
30
percent
to
somewhere
around
13
percent,
so
there
is
an
inference
that
mimms
and
its
progeny
within
the
states
has,
in
fact,
worked.
