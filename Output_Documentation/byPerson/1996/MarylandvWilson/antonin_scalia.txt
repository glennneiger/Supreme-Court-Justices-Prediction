justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
when
you
say
assaulted
in
traffic
stops
does
that
include
those
who
were
assaulted
by
people
who
got
out
of
the
car
and
physically
assaulted
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
cut
the
other
way.
i
mean,
that...
they'd
be
better
off
to
leave
them
in
the
car,
if
that...
you
know,
if
that's
the
assault
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
relevant
figure
is
how
many
of
the
assaults
came
while
a
person
was
in
the
car,
so
that
they
might
have
been
prevented
by
making
the
person
get
out
of
the
car.
many
of
them
may
have
occurred
by
taking
the
person
out
of
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
will
work
automatically,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
bureaucracies
being
what
they
are,
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
claims
of
discrimination,
making
some
people
get
out
because
of
their
race
or
because
of
whatever
else,
to
be
sure
that
no
such
claims
will
be
available
they
will
make
everybody
get
out.
that
will
be
an
invariable
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
the
lady
with
the
baby.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
reno,
you
want
no
reasonableness
limitation
on
this.
i
suppose
that
means
that
a
police
officer
could
stop
a
bus
and
say,
everybody
off
the
bus.
or...
you
know,
does
vehicle
size
come
into
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
for
you.
you
want
no
reasonableness
limitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
reno,
how
much
of
a
problem
is
it
in
the
states
that
haven't
adopted
this
rule?
how
often
does
a
citizen
who
has
been
told
to
stay
in
the
car
or
told
to
get
out,
in
those
states
that
require
a
reasonable
suspicion,
at
least,
on
the
part
of
the
officer,
how
often
have
those
citizens
sued
and
recovered?
i
mean,
is
it
a
real
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
think
a
policeman
is
more
at
risk
from
a
passenger
in
the
car
than
from
the
bystanders
who
congregate
when
the
stop
is
made?
why
is
he
more
at
risk
from
the
passenger,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
car
has
been
stopped
only
for
a
traffic
vio...
i
mean,
if
the
car
has
been
stopped
because
of
suspicion
of
drugs,
that
would
be
something
else,
but
let's
assume
it's
just
a
speeding
violation.
is
an
officer
usually
more
at
risk
from
the
passenger
than
from
bystanders?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
correct?
do
you
know
what
the
practice
is
in
those
states
that
have
adopted
a
you-can-do-it-all-the-time
kind
of
a
rule?
do
they
do
it
all
the
time,
or
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that's
no
good,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
to...
either
to
keep
them
in
or
to
make
them
get
out,
either
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
thought--
--no,
it's
not.
no,
that's
not
your
line
on--
--you
say
he
can
keep
him
in
if
he
has
a
reasonable
suspicion,
at
least.
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
warnken,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you...
in
this
balancing
of
the
various
interests
you
portray
the
passenger
as
being,
you
know,
a
wholly
innocent
individual
as
much
a
stranger
to
the
whole
incident
as
somebody
who
was
standing
on
the
curb
and
watched
the
traffic
violation.
but
in
fact,
unless
you're
being
kidnapped
you
have
voluntarily
placed
yourself
in
a
vehicle
driven
by
someone
whom
you
know,
and
who
violates
the
speed
limit.
why
isn't
it
a
reasonable
consequence
of
that
that
when
you
do
that
you
may
trust
this
driver
with
a
certain
amount
of
your
inconvenience?
he
may
cause
you
to
have
to
get
out
of
the
car
sometimes,
even
in
the
rain.
justice
antonin
scalia
serve
you
right
for
driving
with
this
fellow,
or
not
saying,
you
know,
you're
going
too
fast,
or
whatever.
it's
really
not
a
totally
innocent
person
as,
oh,
gee,
you
know,
how
did
i
get
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
drove
with
a
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
don't
understand
that.
