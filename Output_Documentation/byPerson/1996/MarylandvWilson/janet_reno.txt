ms.
janet
reno
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
traffic
stops
present
special
dangers
to
police
officers.
they're
faced
with
an
unknown
situation,
an
unknown
area,
they're
faced
with
little
knowledge,
if
any
knowledge
of
the
occupants
of
the
car,
and
they
are
vulnerable
to
attack
not
just
from
the
driver
but
from
the
passenger.
in
mimms,
this
court
found
that
these
safety
concerns
justify
a
per
se
rule
that
an
officer
in
a
valid
traffic
stop
can
order
the
driver
to
exit
the
vehicle.
we
submit
that
mimms
should
be
applied
to
passengers
for
three
reasons
on
the
issue
of
order
to
exit.
first,
the
driver...
the
officer
has
to
focus
on
the
driver
in
implementing
the
traffic
stop
and
in
securing
the
information
with
respect
to
a
license
or
to
the
vehicle.
he
cannot
monitor
the
passenger's
conduct
at
the
same
time.
the
focus
in
mimms
was
on
the
inordinate
risk,
and
the
court
made
specific
reference
to
the
inordinate
risk
as
an
officer
approaches
a
person
seated
in
the
car,
and
the
court
specifically
said
that
the
officer
had
no
reason
in
mimms
to
believe
that
the
officer
was
suspect
as
to
foul
play,
so
it
was
the
focus
on
a
person
seated
in
the
car
that
created
the
danger.
ms.
janet
reno
yes,
your
honor.
that
might
be
a
more
difficult
question
for
the
court,
but--
ms.
janet
reno
--again,
the
bus
situation
can
be
an
unknown
situation
for
that
officer,
and
he
needs
the
opportunity,
under
our
position,
to
be
able
to
size
up
the
situation,
to
determine
and
observe
the
people
involved,
and
he
may
determine
that
he
wishes
them
to
stay
in
or
to
exit.
police
practices
indicate
that
both
are
appropriate,
depending
on
the
stage
of
the
traffic
stop
and
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
traffic
stop.
we
are
submitting
that
under
the...
this
court's
rule
in
mimms,
it
is
the
persons
seated
in
the
vehicle
that
create
the
danger
and
the
approach
to
that
danger,
and
a
police
officer
should
not
have
to
calibrate
what
is
in...
critical
and
what
is
not
critical.
he
should
be
able
to
size
up
the
situation,
determine
who's
there,
get
full
view
of
them
when
appropriate,
get
them
out
of
the
car
to
neutralize
the
situation,
to
get
them
away
from
the
gun,
and
we
submit
that
the
intrusion
is
de
minimis.
ms.
janet
reno
terry
might
not
have
given,
if
the
passenger
had
been
in
the
same
situation
as
mimms
with
a
gun
in
his...
under
his
sports
coat,
he
might
not
have
been
able
to
see
that
seated
in
the
car.
ms.
janet
reno
no,
your
honor.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
and
as
police
practice
points
out,
in
many
instances
they
will
want
them
to
stay
in
the
car.
if
one
officer
is
on
the
scene,
he
may
want
them
all
in
the
car
so
he
can
better
control
them,
or
if
the
lighting
is
such
or
the
circumstances
are
such
or
the
window
is
such
that
he
wants
the
passenger
whom
he
has
seen
looking
at
him
in
a
curious
way,
he
may
want
him
out
of
the
car
to
determine
whether
he
has
a
weapon
on
his
person.
it's
going
to
depend
on
so
many
different
circumstances--
ms.
janet
reno
--one
cannot
say
when...
how
he
would
be
more
apt
to
use
the
gun.
what
he
can
say
is
that
there
would
be
situations
where
that
gun
may
not
be
observed
as
the
passenger--
ms.
janet
reno
--that
is...
the
justification
that
i'm
advancing
is
that
that
officer
should
have
the
ability
to
immediately
size
up
the
situation,
determine
if
there
is
any
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
a
person
is
armed,
and
then
advance
to
terry
frisk
if
that
is
appropriate,
but
that
he
should
have
the
opportunity
to
control
the
situation
if
he
is
the
single
officer
on
the
scene
before
the
backup
comes,
to
keep
them
in
the
car
so
that
he
doesn't
have
a
person
moving
here,
here,
and
here,
or
to
get
them
out
of
the
car
if
there
are
circumstances
that
dictate
that
they
should
be
out
of
the
car.
ms.
janet
reno
in
robinette,
your
honor,
the
court
specifically
cited
it
would
favor
the
mimms
decision,
and
concluded...
pointed
out
that
mimms,
considering
all
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
it
was
reasonable
in
light
of
the
safety
concern
for
the
officer
that
was
more
than
balanced
against
the
de
minimis
intrusion
into
the
passenger's
personal
security,
that
in
those
totality
of
circumstances
it
was
reasonable,
under
mimms,
to
justify
it.
ms.
janet
reno
i
don't
have
any
information
that
i
could
provide
to
you,
your
honor.
ms.
janet
reno
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
opinion,
your
honor.
ms.
janet
reno
at
a
crime
scene,
if
someone
entered
in
beyond
the
crime
rope
there
would
definitely
be
authority
to
control,
and
it
would
depend
on
the
state
law.
ms.
janet
reno
the
issue
with
respect
to
a
traffic
stop,
your
honor,
is
the
unknown,
the
danger
in
approaching
the
vehicle.
the
danger
in
approaching
people
seated
in
the
vehicle
is
what
the
court
in
mimms
specifically
referred
to.
in
the
instance
where
you
have
people
who
are
bystanders
you
have
an
opportunity
to
observe
them
to
make
an
appropriate
decision,
but
in
the
situation
with
the
automobile,
he's
approaching
an
automobile.
he
doesn't
know
what's
in
it.
he
can't
see
into
it
from
his
patrol
car.
he
doesn't
know
who's
there.
he
can't
see
their
actions
fully.
that
is
the
issue
that
makes
this
situation
different
than
the
situation
of
bystanders
who
may
be
in
plain
view.
ms.
janet
reno
that's
not
the
issue
before
the
court,
but
we
would
submit
that
it
would
be
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
janet
reno
it
is
not
a
prolonged
seizure
because
this
court
in
berkemer
has
referred
to
traffic
stops.
it
applies
to
routine
traffic
stops.
it
applies
to
a
brief,
temporary
stop,
and
under
those
circumstances
the
officer
should
be
able
to
see
the
person
as
they
exit
the
car.
ms.
janet
reno
it
can,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
is
usually
of
that
duration,
but
that
is
a
limited
duration
in
which
the
police
officer
can
have
the
opportunity
to
size
up
the
situation
and
see
whether
the
person
presents
a
threat.
for
example,
if
the
person
got
out
of
the
automobile,
and
this
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court,
and
suddenly
ran
into
the
bushes
and...
the
officer,
we
submit,
ought
to
be
able
to
control
that
situation
so
he
can
first
determine
the
risk
to
him
before
the
person
departs.
ms.
janet
reno
may
i--
ms.
janet
reno
--complete
the
answer,
your
honor?
in
that
situation,
if
the
person
were
free
to
go,
again
the
officer
would
have
the
opportunity
to
observe
him,
to
see
whether
there
was
a
basis
for
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
would
justify
a
frisk,
or
justify
action
to
protect
the
officer's
safety
in
that
situation.
