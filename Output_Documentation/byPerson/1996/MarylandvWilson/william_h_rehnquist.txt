we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1268,
maryland
v.
jerry
lee
wilson.
general
curran.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
reason
for
detaining
the
passenger
in
a
situation
like
that?
i
can
see
that
safety
reasons
might
suggest
that
you
be
able
to...
the
officer
be
allowed
to
order
the
passenger
out
of
the
car,
but
for
detaining
them
if
they
then
wish
to
leave,
what
would
be
the
fourth
amendment
reason
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
a
lesser
interest
on
the
part
of
the
driver
in
privacy
or
not
being
free
from
whatever
you...
whether
it's
searching...
the
driver...
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
driver
has
committed
an
offense,
whereas
there
isn't
any
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
passenger
has
committed
offense,
an
offense,
so
the
calculus,
if
it's
a
weighing
process,
the
interests
of
the
passenger
would
seem
stronger
than
the
interest
of
the
driver.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
curran.
we'll
hear
now
from
the
attorney
general,
ms.
reno.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
reno.
mr.
warnken,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
passenger
will
be
detained
during
the
stop
unless
under
justice
souter's
hypothesis
the
passenger
is
free
to
walk
away,
but
it's
a
voluntary
thing.
it
may
not
be
too
voluntary
if
you're
out
on
the
desert
somewhere,
but
if
you're
in
an
airport,
if
you're
being
driven
to
the
airport
by
somebody
and
you
have
a
chance
to
catch
a
plane
if
you
get
a
cab
it
might
make
quite
a
bit
of
difference.
but
i
don't
see
why
it
would
necessarily
follow
that
the
passenger
is
detained
for
30
minutes
if
the
driver
is
detained
for
30
minutes,
under
the
hypothesis
justice
souter
proposes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
your
rule
he'll
be
detained
anyway.
he's
sitting
in
the
car
rather
than
standing
outside.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
it
in
mimms.
mimms
is
a
bright
line
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
if
you
had
that
expectation
passengers
would
exert
some
influence
over
the
drivers
to
drive
more
safely.
for
pete's
sake,
it's
raining
out.
i
don't
want
to
have
to
get
out
of
the
car.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
the
25
million
figure
from,
since
figures
seem
to
be
hard
to
come
by
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
had
not
understood
justice
souter's
hypothesis...
i
thought
his
hypothesis
you
can
be
told
to
get
out
of
the
car
but
you
can't
be
detained.
once
you're
out
of
the...
once
you've
complied
with
that
request,
you're
free
to
leave,
unless
there's...
there
is
some
terry
suspicion.
i
didn't
express
that
when
i
put
the
hypo
to
you
as
distinct,
i
think,
from
the
way
i
put
it
to
ms.
reno,
but
that's
what
i
was
assuming,
that
the
passenger
could
go
if
he
wanted
to.
but
if
the
passenger
chose
to
stay
at
the
scene,
the
officer
could
say
either,
you
stay
in
the
car
or
you
get
out.
that
was
the
hypothesis
that
i--
--well,
that's
the
hypothesis
i
was
talking
about,
too,
because
by
giving
that
order
the
police
officer
is
exercising
control
to
tell
the
person
where
to
be
at
that
particular
moment
by
getting
out
of
the
car
where
he
would
rather
stay
in,
but
that's
not
true
of
the
bystander
who
can't
approach
the
scene.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
warnken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
curran,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
general
curran,
can
you
tell
me
why
we...
i
resent
being
put
in
the
position
of
deciding
this
case
on
speculation,
as
lawyers
sometimes...
you
look
at
the
ceiling
well,
if
we
do
this,
this
will
happen.
you're
telling
us
that
it
will
increase
police
safety
if
we
adopt
this
automatic
rule.
none
of
the
briefs...
and
there's
a
brief
here
by
20
states
or
so...
make
any
attempt
to
compare
the
assaults
on
police
in
the
states
that
have
the
rule
you're
urging
us
to
adopt
and
the
states
that
don't
have
that
rule,
and
that's
the
crucial
question.
we
know
we're
going
to
inconvenience
citizens
to
some
extent.
we
don't
know
whether
we're
going
to
increase
police
safety.
why...
aren't
those
statistics
available?
why
doesn't
somebody
come
and
say,
this
is
the
proof
of
what
we're
saying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
curran.
the
case
is
submitted.
