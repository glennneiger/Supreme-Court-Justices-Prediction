justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
there's
no
time
limit.
i
assume
the
time
can
be
no
more
than
is
reasonably
required
for
the
officer
to
complete
the
process
of
issuing
the
citation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
he
order
some
people
in
the
car
and
some
people
out
of
the
car?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
right
to
control
the
site,
what's
your
best
citation
from
this
court
giving
you
that
authority,
michigan
and
summers,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
the
closest
case,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
closest
case
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
officer
does
have
this
authority
to
control
the
location?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
not
just
physics,
it's
privacy
and
dignity,
and
we
all
know
that
the
police
will
take
our
decisions
as
far
as
their
language
and
logic
permit,
and
i'm
just
concerned
that
you're
going
to
have
routine
practices
of
whole
families
and
four
or
five
occupants
of
the
cars
being
required
to
stand
outside
while
the
officer
lectures
the
driver.
i
mean,
that's
just
going
to
happen,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
what
we're
here
to
decide--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
you're
proposing
a
general
automatic
rule
that
passengers
can
always
be
required
to
exit
at
the
demand
of
the
officers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is,
do
you
have
concerns
about
it?
do
you,
as
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
your
state,
have
concerns
about
a
rule
where
throughout
your
state,
maybe
throughout
the
country,
all
the
occupants
of
every
vehicle
that
is
stopped
for
a
traffic
offense
can
be
ordered
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
routinely
are
required
to
parade
the...
required
to
remain
in
public
view
while
the
citation
process
is
going
on?
do
you
have
any
concerns
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
concealment
thing.
do
you
agree,
general...
ms.
reno
with
the
attorney
general
from
maryland
that
the
passengers
who
have
been
told
to
exit
can
be
required
to
remain
and
not
take
the
taxi
or
leave?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
this
is
a
prolonged
seizure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
know
that
when
they
check
licenses
on
their
radio
and
hold
the
passenger
it
can
sometimes
take
15
or
20
minutes
for
a
routine
traffic
stop,
can
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear.
in
your
view,
the
passengers
have
a
right
to
exit
whether...
even
if
the
officer
does
not
want
them
to?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
we're
just...
we
have
to
decide
that
case
here,
but
it...
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
rule
would
be.
that,
it
seems
to
me
very...
could
be
very
dangerous
to
the
officers.
or
if
he
was
to
say,
well,
we're
getting
out
to
see
what's
going
on
here,
you've
got
two
or
three
doors
opening...
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
dangerous
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
see,
that...
part
of
that
illustrates
that...
and
sometimes
bright
line
rules
actually
help
our
citizens.
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
and
it
becomes
generally
known
the
supreme
court
says
you
do
not
have
to
get
out
of
car,
and
then
there
are
some
ducking
motions
and
the
officer
says,
out,
and
the
citizen
says
i
don't
have
to
get
out,
what
do
we
have?
we
have
litigation.
we
have
doubt.
we
have
uncertainty.
and
this
is
not
always
helpful
to
the
citizen.
