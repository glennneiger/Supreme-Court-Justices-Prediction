justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true,
general
curran...
i
remember
this
from
the
mimms
case...
that
there's
a
split
of
professional
opinion
on
whether
it
is
safer
for
the
officer
to
order
them
out
of
the
car
or
to
tell
them
to
stay
in
the
car?
is
there
still
a
respected
body
of
professional
law
enforcement
opinion
that
says
you're
safer
if
you
don't
ask
them
to
get
out
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
curran,
can
i
ask
this
one
question?
you
suggested
as
a
justification
for
that
that
the
passenger
is
already
seized,
just
like
the
driver.
they're
both
forced
to
stop.
but
the
driver
has
been
lawfully
taken
into
custody
during
the
investigation.
there's
no
lawful
authority
to
take
the
passenger
into
custody.
he's
seized
in
the
sense
the
car
had
to
stop,
but
he's
not
legally
seized,
is
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
interrupt
with
just
this
one
thought
that
crosses
my
mind?
do
you
think
the
officer
is
greater
or
less
danger,
if
there's
a
passenger
sitting
in
the
car
with
the
gun
in
his
jacket
as
you
describe,
if
he
tells
him
to
get
out
of
the
car?
is
he
less
or...
which
situation
would
he
be
more
apt
to
use
the
gun
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
it
would
certainly
help
to
arrest
people
who
carry
guns,
that's
right.
i
see
you
would
catch
more
gun-carriers,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
justification
you're
advancing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you--
--it
doesn't
help
the
mother
with
the
baby
in
the
snowstorm
very
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
practical
answer
to
this
case
that
officers
really
aren't
going
to
ask
everybody
to
get
out.
they're
only
going
to
ask
them
to
get
out
when
they're
a
little
worried
about
the
high
crime
neighborhood,
and
the
darkness,
and
so
forth.
then
they've
got
terry
justification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
we
really
want
is
more
back
seat
drivers,
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if...
i
just
don't
remember
your
brief
well
enough.
do
you
discuss
the
hypothetical
that
justice
souter
gave
you
about
maintaining
order
near
an
arrest
scene?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
proper
distinction
there...
and
i'd
just
like
you
to
comment
on
it,
because
i've
trying
to
think
it
through
as
he
raised
the
question...
that
in
that
situation
nobody's
seized?
they're
told
to
stay
away.
in
your
situation,
the
passenger
is
seized.
he's
told
to
stay
where
he
is,
which
is
a
very...
at
least
analytically
a
different
concept.
