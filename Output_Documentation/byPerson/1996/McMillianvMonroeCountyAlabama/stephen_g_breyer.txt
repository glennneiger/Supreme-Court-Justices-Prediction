justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
constitution
i
think
identifies
him
as
a
state
official.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
get
your
answer
to
this,
which
is
the
problem
that's
bothering
me
the
most
from
your
point
of
view.
if
i
looked
at
alabama
law,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
in
what
i'd
think
is
the
most
closely
analogous
area,
the
most
closely
analogous
question
would
be,
for
state
law
purposes,
is
this
sheriff
a
person
under
tort
principles
where
the
county
is
held
liable
under
respondeat
superior,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
says
no.
it
says
the
sheriff
of
a
county
for
jail
purposes
is
not
considered
an
employee
of
the
county
for
purposes
of
imposing
liability
upon
the
county,
so
if
that's
alabama
law,
and
they're
saying
for
purposes
of
imposing
liability,
respondeat
superior
in
tort,
he's
not
a
county
official,
how
do
you
get
around
that
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
would
the...
but
when
you
say
conflict,
i
have
a
case
here
called
king
v.
colbert
county,
may
7,
1993,
and
it
seems
to
say
quite
clearly
the
sheriff
is
not
considered
an
employee
for
purposes
of
imposing
liability
upon
the
county.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
in
conflict?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
then
why
should
1983
impose
respondeat
superior
constitutional
tort
liability
upon
a
body
that
states
do
not
impose
respondeat
superior
liability
upon?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
if
he's
a
final--
--so
if
you
don't...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
going
back
to
justice
souter's
question
before,
if
that's
the
test
of
the...
if
the
question
is
who
can
control
him,
i
suppose
the
people
who
have
the
greatest
power,
just
as
justice
souter
mentioned
before,
to
control
the
actions
of
the
sheriff
are
the
county
voters,
because
if
he
doesn't
do
the
right
thing
they
won't
elect
him
again.
and
so
if
that's
the
test,
why
isn't
he
then
a
county
official?
indeed,
any
state
official
who
is
elected
on
a
county
basis
would
become
for
monell
purposes
a
county
official.
why
not?
that's
fairly
clear.
people
who
pay
the
piper
call
the
tune,
and
they're
paid
at
a
county
level
and
he's
elected
at
a
county
level--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no,
that's
all
quite
right,
but
you'd
say
that
the
person...
all
we're
interested
in
really
is
what
hat
is
he
wearing
when
he
performs
these
actions?
is
he
wearing
his
state
hat,
or
his
county
hat,
and
there
isn't
much
to
tell
us--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--except
for
the
fact
that
the
county
people
elect
him
and
they
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
was
a
separate...
i
just
think
that
probably
monell
basically...
well,
different
people...
i
don't
know
if
we'll
go
into
that
in
great
depth,
but
basically
you're
trying
to
say
the
people,
or
at
least
where
it's
policy,
whom
you
work
for
normally
pay,
but
of
course
they
don't
if
it's
the
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
there's
sovereign
immunity,
so
the
real
question
is,
should
the
sovereign
immunity
principle
apply
here,
and
you
say
why
should
it
when
they're
elected
at
a
county
level.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
do.
he's
the
sheriff,
and
which
hat
is
he
wearing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that...
i
mean,
is
there
any
sense
in
which
there's
a
general
state
policy?
what
i'm
thinking
is,
if
you
have
perhaps
the
state
representative
for
city
streets,
the
highway
commission,
state
highway
commission,
there
will
be
some
official
in
each
county
who's
in
charge
of
highways,
and
i
bet
they
have
a
certain
amount
of
discretion,
but
i
would
imagine
also
they
meet
from
time
to
time
at
the
state
level
and
there
are
more
general
state
policies,
too.
is
there
anything
like
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anything
in
the
state
capital,
or
any
group
of
people
at
the
state
level
who
would
feel
that
they
have
the
responsibility,
even
at
a
highly
general
level,
for
coordinating
the
policies
of
the
individual
county
sheriffs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
he
actually
do
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
has
he
ever
written
a
paper,
or
has
he
ever
issued
an
order
or
a
suggestion
which
says
i
think
that
the
sheriffs
in
these
counties
should
follow
the
following
policy
at
a
very
general
level?
is
there
any
document
like
that
that's
ever
been
written?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
you
could
have...
i
mean,
not
that
i
necessarily
want
to
defend
an
opinion
in
which
i
was
on
the
panel--
[laughter]
nonetheless,
i
guess
in
that,
what
i
thought
that
that
was
involving
is
that
you
can't
have
a
county
official
or
a
city
official
who
is
not
responsible
to
anyone
else
in
the
city
or
county
for
the
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
here
is
what
hat
is
the
sheriff
wearing,
his
county
hat,
or
a
state
hat,
not
whether
there's
some
other
person
in
the
county
government
who
might
control
his
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
that
being
so,
it's
clear,
isn't
it,
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
reasoning
was
wrong?
i
mean,
they
were
looking
for
somebody
else
in
the
county
that
had
this
policy,
so
one
possible
thing
would
be
to
tell
them
they're
wrong
and
let
them
work
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
that
wouldn't
be
the
issue,
whether
county...
the
question
is,
did
the
sheriff
have
something
to
do
with
law
enforcement?
clearly
he
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
what
hat
is
he
wearing?
