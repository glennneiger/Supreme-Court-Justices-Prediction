mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
an
alabama
county
cannot
be
held
liable
under
section
1983
for
the
actions
of
the
sheriff
for
two
principal
reasons.
first,
the
state
constitution,
as
has
been
noted,
expressly
designates
sheriffs
as
state
officials,
and
follows
up
that
designation
by
treating
them
as
state
officials
for
such
purposes
as
the
procedure
for
removal
from
office,
and
the
absolute
immunity
that
is
only
given
to
state
constitutional
officers,
immunity
from
state
tort
liability.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
the
identification
of
municipal
policymakers
turns
on
an
analysis
of
state
law.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i
think
it's
kind
of
an
intersection
between
state
and
federal
law.
you
have
a
federal
statute
that
says
we'll
hold
you
liable
under
certain
circumstances.
one
of
the
circumstances
is
where
the
municipal...
the
government
has
enacted
a
policy,
and
then
the
court
says,
to
determine
whether
it's
a
municipal
policy
we're
going
to
look
at
state
law
to
determine--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--correct.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
distinction.
it
seems
to
me
what
you
have
to
do
is,
you
have
a
certain
federal
standard
that
has
to
be
met
and
then
you
match
that
up
against
a
set
of
state
requirements,
or
state
structural
features
of
the
state
government
and
you
decide
ultimately
does
the
federal
law,
does
the
statute
that
congress
passed
in
1871,
was
it
intended
to
impose
liability
under
these
circumstances?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
i
really
don't
think
you
can
answer
that
question
without
looking
at
state
law
to
determine--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
i
guess--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
what
you're
asking
is,
can
there
be
a
situation
where
we
would...
where
the
court
would
properly
disregard
a
label
that
says
he's
a
state
official,
based
on
other
circumstances
that
are
present
such
as
the
fact
that
he
actually
day-by-day
works
for
the
county
commission
and
so
therefore
there's
a
concern
that
the
state
statute
that
designates
him
a
state
official
is
fictitious,
i
think
under
those
circumstances
that
would
be
appropriate.
because
the
two
factors
that
i
was
going
to
outline
at
the
beginning
were
1)
what
the
law
says
the
scope
of
the
municipal
corporation
is
expressly,
and
2)
who
does
this
official
work
for
and
is
he...
who
is
he
controlled
by,
and
i
do
think
there
are
situations
where
if,
in
fact,
the
person
is
controlled
by
the
governing
body
of
the
municipal
corporation,
that
fact
would
be
enough
to
make
him
a
municipal
policymaker
regardless
of
the
express
statements
of
law.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
true,
too.
i
think
if
it
were
true
that
he
was
expressly
designated
a
county
official
by
law,
and
the
court
determined
that
the
state
statute
said
this
is
the
county
policymaker
for
x
area
of
governmental
activity
but
we
want
him
to
be
autonomous
from
this
other
governing
body
over
here,
i
can
imagine
state
law
doing
that,
too,
defining
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
the
state
law
establish
the
contours
of
the
municipal
corporation
such
that
the
corporation
includes
not
only
a
governing
body
but
another
autonomous
board
or
official
who
was
supposed
to
be
part
of
that
municipal
corporation,
that
you
have
a
kind
of
hydra-headed
corporation
under
state
law,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that's
what
state
law
said,
then
yes,
he
would
be
a
municipal
policymaker.
so
you
can
have
a
situation
where
autonomous
boards
or
officials
are
within
the
scope
of
the
municipal
corporation
because
that's
what
the
state
decided
to
do,
and
it
may
be
fairly
frequent
in
big
cities.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
you're
asking
about
those
specific
individuals,
i
think
that
there's...
there
are...
those
are
kind
of
border-line
cases
where
there's
indications
that
go
both
ways.
for
example,
the
tax
assessor
works
for
the
state
as
well
as
for
the
county,
collects
taxes
for
the
state
as
well
as
for
the
county.
he's
supervised
very
closely
by
the
state,
but
you
don't
have
anything
like
the
express
designation
of
a
state
official
that
we
have
here
with
the
sheriff.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
as
to
the
coroner,
he's
elected
in
the
county,
and
he's
called
a
county
coroner.
he
performs
inquest
functions
which
kind
of
work
with
the
state
judiciary.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
my
position,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that's
certainly
possible,
that
if
the
full
analysis
of
the
law
about
the
coroner
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
state
intended
him
to
be
a
county
officer
making
policy
for
the
county,
his
autonomy
from
the
county
commission
would
not
by
itself
preclude
that
conclusion
that
he
is
a--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
you
would
look
at
what
state
law
says
about
whether
he's
part
of
the
municipal
corporation
or
not,
and
here
the
state
law's
quite
explicit
on
that
subject
and
says
not
only
is
he
autonomous
from
the
county
commission,
but
he
is
a
state
officer
who
is
a
member
of
the
state
executive
department.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
with
respect
to
his
day-to-day
activities,
many
of
them
are
controlled
by
other
state
officials.
the
one
you
mentioned
about
where
he's
going
to
put
his
patrol
cars
he's
got
a
fair
amount
of
discretion.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
on
those
issues
he's
not
supervised
by
anyone.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
but
there
are
several
things
you
should
understand.
much
of
his
work
is
under
the
supervision
of
state
officials,
state
prosecutors,
the
da's
are
state
officials,
the
judges--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
well,
to
the
extent
that
he
stays--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--within
the
confines
of
what
would
be
an
impeachable
offense
in
alabama,
he's
got
final
say
on
that,
sure.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's
exactly
what
would
happen,
and
then
the
governor
would
say
you--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
want
a
report
on
my
desk
in
the
morning
about
what
you're
doing.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
the
impeach--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but
the
list
of
grounds
for
impeachment,
justice
stevens,
include
incompetence,
neglect
of
duty--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
precisely...
that's
precisely
why
he's
treated
as
a
final
policymaker,
and
that
is
the
way
government
is
set
up
in
many
places.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
local
election
doesn't
tell
you
anything
about
whether
a
particular
official
is
part
of
a
municipal
corporation
separate
and
apart
from
state
government--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but
with
respect,
justice
breyer,
the
reason
that
we
have
public
liability
under
monell
is
because
there
are
separate
corporate
structures
that
exist,
and
so
saying
that
he's
locally
elected
and
locally
funded
may
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
he's
a
local
official--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
of
course,
they
don't--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
reason
that
the
state
doesn't
pay
under
1983
is
not
sovereign
immunity,
justice
breyer.
it's
that
the
statute
only
imposes
liability
on
persons,
and
the
only
reason
there's
liability
on
anybody
other
than
the
individual
wrongdoer
in
any
case
is
because
municipal
corporations
are
treated
as
persons.
in
order
to
get
there
you
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
we
have
a
person
here,
which
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the
sheriff
is
clearly
being
held
liable.
the
question
is
whether
there's
some
other
person
that
he
is
acting
for
when
he
acts,
and
that
person,
the
county
under
state
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
him.
he's
not
part
of
the
corporate
structure.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
believe
it
happens,
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
under
the
rule
of
local
election
i
suppose
they
would
be.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
clearly
one
needs
to
look
beyond
that.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
distinguish
the
local
district
attorney
and
the
local
district
judge.
they
are
elected
locally,
they
work
in
a
building
that
is
paid
for
and
operated
by
the
county
commission--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--and
their
salaries
are
supplemented
routinely
by
county
commissions.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
not
all
of
their
salary,
but
part
of
their
salary,
so
we're
getting
down
to
a
fairly
small--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--my
position,
your
honor,
would
be
that
those
factors
tell
you
literally
nothing
about
whether
that
official
is
inside
the
municipal
corporation
or
outside
the
municipal
corporation,
because
both
of
those
things
could
exist
and
state
law
could
still
make
it
really
clear
that
this
is
a
state
person
who's
answerable
to
the
state
and
not
part
of
the
way
they
decided
to
set
up
their
municipal
corporation.
counties
are
very
narrow
things
in
alabama.
they
have
these
specific
functions.
they
don't
have
home
rule,
and
for
purposes
of
state
law
the
county
commission
and
the
county
are
really
indistinguishable,
so
the
notion
that
there's
this
sort
of
free-floating
geography
that
includes
everybody
into
a
corporate
structure--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--certainly.
there's
a
county
administrator
who's
essentially
there,
keeps
the
paperwork
flowing
and
deals
with
routine
matters
within
the
scope
of
the
areas
that
are
run
by
the
county
commission.
they
run
the
road
systems,
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
things
that
could
be
done
by
people
who
work
for
the
county
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
county
commission.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
correct,
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
as
i
think
i
said
earlier,
it's
possible
that
one
could
come
to
that
conclusion
about
the
coroner,
depending
on
the
overall
analysis
of
whether
or
not
the
state
intended
to
treat
them
as
independent
county
officers.
i
don't--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
the
law
on
the
coroner
is
much
less
clear.
i
mean,
i
think
you
have
factors
pointing
in
different
directions.
you
have
autonomy,
which
is
one
of
my
factors,
pointing
in
one
way,
and
you
have
some
laws
which
say
he's
a
county
official
pointing
another
way.
here,
however,
we
have
autonomy
of
an
official
expressing
designated
and
consistently
treated
as
a
state
official
under
state
law,
so
the
factors
are
pointing
the
same
way.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
do
not
think
that
the
attorney
general
could
call
him
up
and
order
him
to
add
an
extra
squad
car
to
his
patrol.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
or
patrol
more
carefully.
if
he
had
decided
to
not
carry
out
his
law
enforcement
functions,
which
is
what
the
question
was,
certainly
that
would
be
an
impeachable
offense.
the
governor...
well,
short
of
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
reason
i
focus
on
the
impeachment
provision,
your
honor,
is
not
because
i
think
it
makes
the
attorney
general
the
policymaker,
but
because
the
law
in
the
constitution
expressly
differentiates
between
state
and
local
officials
on
the
kind
of
impeachment
procedure
that
applies,
and
they
centralize
control
in
1901
over
sheriffs
by
making
them
impeachable
only
at
the
state
level
based
on
the
attorney
general's
initiation.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure.
here,
though,
because
he's
a
state
constitutional
officer
as
well,
the
governor
has
the
authority
to
make
him
report
on
any
of
his
activities,
and
the
way
the
constitution
was
set
up
in
1901,
any
false
report
that
was
made
to
the
governor
is
by
itself
automatically
an
impeachable
offense,
so
that
in
practice
what
can
happen
much
more
easily
than
impeachment
is
that
you
get
called
on
the
carpet
by
the
governor
and
your
misconduct
or
your
misfeasance
would
then
be
publicized
and
the
governor
has
a
fair
amount
of
practical
control
over
sheriffs.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
i--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
absolutely
right.
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
idea
that
he
has
a
fair
amount
of
discretion
to
make
his
own
policies
about
how
he's
going
to
carry
out--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--which
is
precisely
why
it
would
seem
strange
to
me
just
to
take
a
law
which
is
supposed
to
have
a
much
narrower
rule
of
liability
than
respondeat
superior
and
apply
it
in
this
context.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure,
but
the...
what
i'm
saying
is,
state
law
doesn't
say
that,
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
no,
no,
no,
state
law
doesn't
say
that
he
is
a
county
policymaker.
it
says
he's
a
state
policymaker
expressly,
so--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
that's
because
he's
got
delegated
authority
under
state
law,
which
is
what
defines
a
policymaker.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
da
is
a
state
policymaker,
too,
when
he
prosecutes
somebody.
lots
of
people
have
policymaking
authority.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
the
aspect
of
state
law
i
was
referring
to
is
saying
that
he's
a
member
of--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--which
is
true
with
respect--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
all
locally
based
state
officials
can...
that
have
policymaking--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--authority
can
set...
within
the
confines
of
state
law
set
certain
policies.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
that's
what
a
locally
based
state
official
does.
he
has
discretion.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i'm
not
familiar
with
a
particular
thing
where
all
the
sheriffs
come
to
montgomery
and
meet
about
what
they're
going
to
focus
on.
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
coordination
that
occurs.
for
example,
there
are
drug
task
forces
that
regionally
occur,
and
sheriff's
officials
in
fact
do
go
outside
their
counties
and
work
collectively
in
a
particular
region.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
you
have
the
attorney
general.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
you're
exceeding
my
knowledge
about
how
things
work
in
practice
in
alabama.
i
do
know,
though,
that
the
sheriffs
work
very
closely
with
the
istrict
attorneys,
which
themselves
work
closely
with
the
attorney
general's
office,
and
so
there's
going
to
be
a
certain
de
facto
coordination.
you
know,
law
enforcement
can't
be
separated
completely
from
prosecutorial
activity
in
that
those
are
state
officials.
the
district
attorney
is
locally
elected,
partly
locally
funded,
working
in
a
county
building,
but
they're
state
officials,
so--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--you
sure
could,
yes,
but
that
wouldn't
be
the
test
that
should
be
applied
under
monell.
i
mean,
obviously,
with
any
elected
official,
state
or
local,
there's...
you
can
make
the
argument
that
the
voters
are
responsible
for
what
they
get,
and
they
ought
to
be...
ultimately
have
to
pay
for
it,
but
that
policy
doesn't
make
any
more
sense
at
a
local
level
than
it
does
at
a
state
level.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's
why
i
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
local
election
doesn't
really
move
the
ball
down
the
field.
it
doesn't
tell
you
whether
he's
in
the
municipal
corporation
or
not.
it
may
be
statistically
more
likely.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
not
that
i
can
think
of.
if
you
look
at
his
other
hats
that
he
wears,
it's
much
clearer
in
all
of
those
contexts
that
he's
a
state
official.
he
takes
direct
supervision
from
the
state
circuit
judge
in
the
circuit.
he
works
directly
with
and
for
the
state
district
attorney.
he
supervises
a
jailer
primarily
by
the
state
department
of
corrections.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i'm
saying
that
in
this
instance
he's
not.
it's
possible
one
could
set
the
law
up
that
way,
that
people
have
two
different
functions
and
in
one
context
they're
supervised
by
the
county
commission
over
here
and
they're
setting
county
policy,
and
in
another
context
they're
working
with
the
judges
over
here
and
they're
fully
implementing
state
policy.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
final
policymaker
has
to
be
without
anybody
who
could
come
in
and
check
what
they've
done
or
supervise
them.
i
mean--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--power
is
delegated
by
one
body
to
another.
the
second
body
can't
still
be
a
final
policymaker.
it's
relevant,
i
think,
where
the
power
comes
from.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
if
state
law
is
express
and
clear
enough
that
we're
still
going
to
treat
them
as
part
of
one
single
municipal
corporation,
that's
true.
now--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--clearly...
clearly--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
he
is...
he
serves
process
for
the
state
judges.
he
executes
judgments,
all
of
that.
there's
a
specific
statute
that
says
that
general
supervision
for
all
of
those
state
activities
is
with
the
state
circuit
judge
and
that
clearly
he's
following
orders
from
the
state
circuit
judge
or
the
state
district
judges
in
that
capacity,
and
when
he's
working
with
the
district
attorneys,
and
once
they
get
involved
in
the
law
enforcement
activities,
he's
working
for
them
as
well.
so
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
activity
there,
and
the
operations
of
the
jail,
the
department
of
corrections
has
reports.
they
come
in,
they
inspect,
that
sort
of
thing,
so
there
is
all
these
different
ways
in
which
he
intersects
and
is
supervised
by
state
officials.
in
no
respect,
however,
does
the
county
commission
have
anything
to
do
with
what
he
does,
other
than
having
his
obligation
to
give
him
money,
and
certainly
the
law
is
clear
that
that
obligation
can't
be
turned
into
leverage
to
control
his
activities.
if
a
county
commission
were
to
say
we
think
you
need
to
be
putting
more
emphasis
on
drug
policy
in
your
law
enforcement
in
this
county,
and
we're
not
going
to
give
you
all
your
money
till
you
do,
there'd
be
an
injunction
in
state
court
within
hours.
it's
just
clearly
grossly
improper
them
to
attempt
to
do
that,
and
there's
no
indication
that
it's
ever
been
done.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
do.
i
think
it
was
focusing
on
a
county
as
a
unit
of
geography
and
not
as
a
municipal
corporation
and
said,
to
the
extent
that
he's
elected
by
the
county
voters,
we're
going
to
treat
him
as
a
county
official,
and
i
think
that
test
is
both
unjustified
under
the
principles
of
monell
and
proves
far
too
much,
because
you
have
lots
of
locally
elected
state
officials
who
under
any
theory,
other
than
just
looking
at
election,
wouldn't
be
viewed
as
part
of
the
municipal
corporation.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
no,
i--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
what
they
were
looking
at
is
whether
or
not,
in
exercising
his
discretion
to
enforce
the
law,
he
was
acting
for
the
county,
and
they
said
the
county
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
law
enforcement.
counties
don't
have
the
authority
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
it
can't
be
a
county
hat
if
the
county
isn't...
doesn't
have
any
role
in
law
enforcement.
that's
what
they
were
saying.
i
mean,
you
could
say
it
different
ways
and
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion,
which
is
to
say,
he's
a
state
official
by
law.
he's
got
authority
that's
unrelated
to
the
county
commission's
control.
when
those
two
things
point
in
the
same
direction,
you
come
to
the
conclusion,
i
think,
that
this
is
not
county
policy.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
not
as--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--in
his
individual
capacity
he
certainly
could
be
held
liable
if
there's--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
true.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
only
brought
it
against
him
in
his
official
capacity
on
the
theory
that
he
was
a
county
official,
and
i
think
the
courts
properly
looked
at
the
suit
against
the
county
and
the
suit
against
him
in
his
official
capacity
as
being
essentially
identical,
because
obviously
you
can't
sue
him
in
his
official
capacity
to
the
extent
he's
a
state
official,
because
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
statute
wouldn't
authorize
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
there
is
an
insurance
program
which
covers
sheriffs
for
certain
torts...
not
other
torts,
not
intentionally
torts.
there's
a
serious
question
here
whether
he
would
be
covered,
but
i
think
the
fact
that
the
county,
in
addition
to
paying
his
salary
and
providing
all
of
his
equipment
and
everything
else
he
uses,
has
also
bought
insurance
for
him
doesn't
by
any
means
indicate
that...
doesn't
have
any
great
significance.
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
one
way
or
the
other,
in
terms
of
indicating
which
hat
he
was
wearing.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
they...
for
the
same
reason
they
pay
for
his
salary
and
all
the
other
things
they
do.
they
provide
what
he
needs
to
get
the
law
enforced
in
the
county.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
they're
required
also
to
provide
for
his
reasonable
needs.
thank
you,
your
honor.
