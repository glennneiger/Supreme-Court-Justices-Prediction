justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
would
suppose
that
if
in
alabama
the
county
is
liable
for
the
acts
of
the...
for
the
judgments
of
the
sheriff,
that
would
not
necessarily
follow
in
a
1983
suit,
because
you'd
still
have
to
comply
with
monell.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
asking
for
a
rule
that
if
the
final
policymaker
is
elected
by
an
entity...
here,
the
county...
that
entity
is
necessarily
responsible
for
the
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it
were
the
other
way
around.
supposing
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
the
case
that
justice
breyer
has
discussed
said
that
the
county
is
liable
for
what
the
sheriff...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
would
certainly
cite
that,
and
you
would
have
an
open
and
shut
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
why
doesn't
it
work
the
other
way
around?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it's
not
respondeat
superior,
what
is
it?
if
the
president
of
a
corporation
does
something
wrong,
and
the
corporation
is
sued,
don't
we
say
that's
respondeat
superior,
or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
the
mayor
of
a
city
does
something,
and
the
city
is
held
liable
on
the
judgment,
isn't
that
respondeat
superior?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why?
the
city
itself
hasn't
done
it,
other
than
through
a
human
agent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it's
not
respondeat
superior,
what
is
it,
some
semantic
legal
category
that
i've
never
seen
before?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
some
policies
that
the
sheriff
in
one
county
might
make
that
a
sheriff
in
another
county
might
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
any
other
legitimate...
give
me
some
examples
of
some
legitimate
policies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
can
vary
from
one
county
to
another
because
the
sheriff
sets
that
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
it's
theoretically
possible,
but
that's
really
the
theory
that
all
of
these
differing
policies
are
all
state
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
really
the
state
policy
is
that
they've
delegated
the
authority
to
the
sheriff
to
do
what
he
wants
to
do.
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
a
state,
or
a
sheriff
in
the
state
of
alabama
runs
on
a
platform
and
he
says
he's
going
to
have
five
different
policies,
one
of
which
is
going
to
be
to
interpret
federal
constitutional
rights
at
their
narrowest
when
he's
interrogating
prisoners.
certainly
in
a
lay...
and
if
the
voters
vote
him
in,
certainly
in
a
law
sense,
in
a
common
sense
use
of
the
term,
we
could
say
this
is
the
policy
of
the
voters
of
that
county,
couldn't
we
not?
