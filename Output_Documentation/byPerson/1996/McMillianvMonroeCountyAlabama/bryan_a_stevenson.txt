mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
whether
an
alabama
county
is
liable
for
the
unconstitutional
actions
of
its
sheriff
where
the
county's
voters
select
and
elect
the
sheriff,
where
the
county's
treasury
funds
the
conduct
of
the
sheriff,
and
where
the
sheriff's
jurisdictional
authority
is
limited
to
the
status
of
the
county
as
one
of
alabama's
67
counties.
at
the
outset,
i
think
in
thinking
about
this
issue
it's
important
to
acknowledge
that
no
one
disputes
that
the
sheriff
is
a
final
policymaking...
a
final
policymaker
in
the
area
of
law
enforcement.
the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
the
sheriff...
alabama
law
gives
the
sheriff
in
alabama
final
policymaking
authority
in
the
area
of
law
enforcement.
respondent
concedes
that
the
sheriff
has
final
policymaking
authority
in
this
area.
the
issue
arises--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
correct.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
it
will
be
paid
by
the
county.
that
is,
that
the
county
has
taken
out
an
insurance
policy--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
the
policy
is
capped,
your
honor,
and
because
we
don't
know
yet
whether
the
county
has
the
option
of
disclaiming
the
conduct
in
question,
then
it
does
make
a
difference.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
not
required
under
alabama
law.
that
is,
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
evidence...
and
again,
the
evidence
is
not
developed...
that
the
county
has
elected
to
take
out
a
policy
which
may
cover
the
sheriff's
conduct
here,
and
while
we
think
that's
relevant
in
deciding
the
county's
interest
in
this
matter,
it's
not
dispositive
of
whether
the
petitioner
will
have
access
to
county
funds,
and
it's
certainly
not
required
under
alabama
law.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct,
justice...
chief
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
may
not
be--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
not
necessarily
by
the
counties,
no.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
it
depends
on
the
solvency
of
the
sheriff.
if
you
mean,
can
the...
can
a
judgment
be
collected
by
the
individual
sheriff,
i
think
that's...
yes,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
that
is,
we
can
recover
from
the
sheriff,
but
our
position
is
obviously
that
where
the
sheriff
was
able
to
effect
mr.
mcmillian's,
the
petitioner's
arrest,
and
to
put
him
on
death
row
pretrial,
and
to
suppress
evidence
that
was
withheld
from
the
prosecution,
he
did
that
because
he
had
the
power
and
status
given
to
him
by
the
county.
we
think
that
1983
ought
not
limit
the
remedy--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
yes,
but
under
alabama
law
the
provisions
that
deal
with
the
conduct
in
question
here
make
it
clear
that
he
exercises
that
authority
for
the
county.
on
page--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
right,
and
we
think
that's
how
the
eleventh
circuit
dealt
with
this
issue.
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
because
the
sheriff's
law
enforcement
authority
is
not
shared
with
some
other
county
official,
that
the
county
is
somehow
not
liable.
we
think
that's
a
misconstruction
of
this
court's
opinion
in
monell
and
its
progeny,
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
only
local
legislative
bodies
can
make
policies
for
which
a
county
is
liable.
just
in
the
same
way
that
a
mayor
can
create
a
policy
that
the
city
council
is
not
responsible
for,
the
city
council
does
not
control,
he
nonetheless
makes
a
policy,
if
it's
final,
that
would
subject
the
city
to
liability.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
not...
it
does
not
turn
entirely
on
the
election
by
the
county's
voters.
we
think
that's
an
important
element,
justice
kennedy,
but
it's
not
the
only
element.
here--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
well,
there
are
several
things.
the
second
factor,
in
addition
to
the
county's
election,
the
voter's
election,
is
that
the
county
pays
for,
the
county
equips,
the
county
funds,
the
county
provides
the
resources
for
all
of
the
sheriff's
law
enforcement
functions,
and
the
county
actually
does
that
with
some
discretionary
authority.
there
is
reasonableness
language
in
the
statute
that
deals
with
the
commission's
authority
to
authorize
a
budget
and
to
authorize
expenditures.
the
third
thing--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
correct.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
true
of
all
of
the
county's
functions.
that
is,
the
county
commission
exercises
its
authority
over
roads,
et
cetera,
under--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
correct.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct,
and
i
guess
our
position
is
that
that's
not
required
to
trigger
municipal
liability
for
these
purposes.
the
third
thing
is
that
the
county's
authority--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct.
in
alabama,
the
district
attorney
is
not
necessarily
limited
to
a
particular
county.
the
judicial
circuit
that
was
created
for
monroe
county
is
a
judicial
circuit
that
includes
other
counties,
and
so
the
district
attorney
receives
his
or
her
check
from
the
state,
from
montgomery,
alabama,
and
that's
true
for
the
judges
as
well,
and
so
there's
a
distinction
between
the
sheriff
and
those
other
judicial
officers.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
they
are
county
officials,
paid
by
the
county,
elected
by
the
county.
they
get
their
resources
from
the
county
treasury,
much
like
the
sheriff,
but
yes,
they
have
final
policymaking
authority
in
their
respective
areas,
inquests
for
the
coroner,
tax
assessments
and
that
sort
of
thing
for
the
tax
assessor.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
not
in
compliance
with
alabama
law.
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
the
county
commission
to
direct
the
conduct
of
any
of
these
county
officials,
and
that's
why
we
contend
that
there
need
not
be
some
sharing
of
authority
before
the
county
be
liable.
the
third
thing,
justice
scalia,
would
be--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
[laughter]
the
third
thing
would
be
the
jurisdiction
of
the
county.
alabama
law
has
created
67
counties.
they
have
legal
status.
that
legal
status
matters
in
the
area
of
law
enforcement
because
the
sheriff
here
cannot
conduct
any
law
enforcement
functions
outside
that
jurisdiction.
the
fourth
thing--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--okay.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
but
i
guess
my
point
would
be
that
if
they're
state
officials
that
are
part
of
some
state
command,
then
their
jurisdiction
and
their
authority
and
their
ability
to
perform
the
functions
which
they
have
been
trained
and
prepared
for
aren't
necessarily
limited
to
that
jurisdiction.
the
chief
of
command
may
pull
them
to
another
division.
for
example,
we
have
a
department
of
public
safety
in
alabama
that
has
abi
agent,
alabama
bureau
of
investigation
agents
dispersed
across
the
state.
they
may
be
assigned
to
a
particular
area,
but
if
the
head
of
that
division
decides
to
move
them
to
another
part,
to
birmingham
or
mobile,
there's
nothing
about
their
status
or
their
function
or
their
jurisdiction
which
limits
that.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes,
your...
i
don't
know
that
they
could
be
moved
in
the
sense
that
someone
can
assign
them,
but
they
have
authority
to
prosecute
cases
in
other
counties
at
the
direction
of
the
court.
they
have
the
authority
to
sometimes
be
sort
of
prosecutors
when
there's
some
conflict
between
another
local
prosecutor
in
another
jurisdiction,
and
the
defendant
or
the
victim
in
a
particular
case,
so
in
that
sense
i
think
they're
more
properly
seen
as
state
officials
who
might
be
able
to
exercise
some
legal
authority
in
some
other
area.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
they're
elected
by
the
judicial
circuit.
that
is,
if
the
judicial
circuit
is
bigger
than
the
county,
then
everyone
in
that
judicial
circuit
would
be
the
voting--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
think
it's
different
in
this
way,
justice
scalia.
there
may
be
exceptions
where
exigencies
might
give
the
sheriff
the
opportunity
to
conduct
some
conduct,
but
they're
recognized
as
exceptions.
they're
recognized
in
some
ways
as
giving
permission
to
the
sheriff
to
exceed
lawful
authority.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i
think
that's
a
fair
criticism,
but
i
think
it's
less
exceptional
both
as
a
matter
of
practice
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
for
the
prosecutor
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
conduct
some
place
else.
and
i
think
this
point
is
emphasized
by
the
next
thing
i'd
stress,
which
is
that
alabama
law
requires
that
another
elected
county
official
take
over
law
enforcement
functions
if
the
sheriff
cannot
perform
them.
that
is,
the
county
coroner
under
alabama
law
assumes
law
enforcement
functions
for
those
circumstances
and
times
when
the
sheriff
can't
do
that.
i
think
that's
because
the
state
law
recognizes
that
the
county,
the
county's
residents,
have
some
investment,
have
some
stake,
have
some
authority
over
at
least
the
selection
in
that
limited
circumstance
of
who
should
be
performing
the
law
enforcement
functions
in
that
particular
community.
the
other
things
that
i
would
point
to
would
be
the
many
references
in
alabama
law
that
clearly
designate
the
sheriff
as
a
county
official.
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
and
i'll
cite
again
or
just
acknowledge
again
that
the
alabama
code...
and
this
is
at
our
brief
at
page
21...
expressly
identifies
as
county
officers
the
sheriff
of
alabama...
the
sheriff
of
a
particular
county.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
what
the
constitution
does,
justice
breyer,
is
identify
him
as
a
member
of
the
executive
department,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
when
you
look
at
that
language,
however,
what
the
constitution
says
is
that
the
sheriff
is
a
member
of
the
executive
department,
and
the
words
they
use
are,
sheriff
for
the
county.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
think
that
alabama
law
is
in
conflict
on
the
question,
on
that
particular
question
in
part
because
the
alabama
courts
have
clearly
said
that
they
want
to
immunize
both
the
state
and
counties
from
tort
judgments
for
this
kind
of
conduct.
we
don't
think,
though...
obviously
that's
not
going
to
resolve
the
federal
question,
which,
as
this
court
has
always
acknowledged--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
not
in...
there's
no
conflict
about
the
tort
liability
of
the
state
or
the
county
with
regard
to--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--it
shouldn't.
the
federal
question
here
does
not
require
this
court
to
impose
respondeat
superior
liability.
if
you
accept
our
view,
you
recognize
that
the
sheriff
is
the
county
official
who
engages
in
law
enforcement
authority
for
the
county,
so
in
that
sense,
he
is
the
master.
he's
the
superior.
no
one
is
under
his
control
in
a
way,
or
he's
not
under
someone
else's
control
that
we're
asking
you
to
make
that
party
liable.
what
the
alabama
counties
have
done
is
shield
counties
and
states
from
liability.
that's
something
they
can
do
under
state
law.
but
it's
our
position
that
federal...
section
1983
was
intended
to
provide
federal
remedies
for
people
like
petitioner--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
that's
right,
but--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--mr.
chief
justice,
our
position
is
that
it's
not
in
this
respect.
we're...
our
position
is
that
because
the
sheriff
is
a
county
official,
because
he
does
exercise
final
policymaking
authority
for
the
county,
and
the
county
controls
that
sheriff
in
the
sense
that
they
elect
him,
the
county
funds
that
sheriff
in
the
sense
that
they
pay
for
his
or
her
conduct,
and
that
that
sheriff
is
tied
to
that
jurisdiction,
that
there
is
this
nexus
between
the
county
and
the
sheriff
that
does
not
make
this
respondeat
superior.
when
congress
was
talking
about
respondeat
superior,
this
kind
of
vicarious
liability
in
1871,
they
were
dealing
with
the
sherman
amendment
which
was
trying
to
make
counties
liable
for
any
conduct
by
any
persons
riotous
or
tumultuously
assembled
in
the
community.
that
was
liability,
you
know,
for
everyone
by
anyone.
the
sheriff
is
not
anyone.
he
is
a
government
official.
he
has
been
elected
and
empowered
by
the
local
government
to
do
the
conduct
that
we're
complaining
about,
and
under
those
facts
and
circumstances--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--for
tort
purposes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
with
regard
to
whether
the
state
law
immunities
bind
this
court,
it
is
certainly
our
position
that
that's
not
true.
this
court
has
always
held
that
federal
law
cannot
be
decided
on
the
way
in
which
a
state
may
choose
to
limit
remedies
under
these
kinds
of
actions.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
think
if
that
was
all
that
was
said,
that
is,
if
the
sheriff
was
not
elected
by
the
county's
officials,
if
the
sheriff
did
not
have
this
relationship
to
the
county
government,
the
county
treasury,
the
county
as
a
jurisdiction,
we
might
still
have
a
problem,
and
i
guess
that's
why
i'm
saying
that
the
congress
doesn't
resolve
this
issue.
under
regents
and
all
of
these
court's...
this
court's
decision
in
the
eleventh
amendment
context
and
in
other
contexts
we've
always
made
clear
that
federal
law
resolves
these
kinds
of
questions,
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at.
certainly
congress
did
not
intend,
in
1871,
to
provide
this
federal
remedy
only
to
have
state
courts
then
decide
that
the
constitutional
officers
or
the
county
officials
involved
in
this
kind
of
conduct
can
be
shielded
from
federal
remedies
by
designating
them
as
something
other
than
the
county
officials
that
the
rest
of
the
code
identifies
them
as
being.
and
justice
breyer,
my
conflict
term
was
a
term
not
about
tort
law
per
se,
but
about
all
of
these
other
provisions
in
the
alabama
code
that
clearly
designate
the
sheriff
as
a
county
officer,
and
the
supreme
court,
the
same
state
court
has
held
the
county
sheriff
to
be
a
county
official
in
other
contexts.
when
there's
a
question
of
pension
or
employment
he's
a
county
official.
when
there's
a
question
about
the
discretion
that
the
county
commission
has
to
not
make
payments
for
law
enforcement
functions,
the
sheriff
is
a
county
official
that
then
has
legal
authority
to
make
the
county
commission
give
him
or
her
the
resources
to
do
those...
do
that
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
the
county
is
liable
for
the
coroner's
conduct.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
state
law
that
deals
with
the
tax
assessor
in
that
context.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
again,
i
would
resist
the
framing
of
that
liability
as
respondeat
superior.
in
our
view,
the
tax
assessor
and
the
coroner
are
different
parts
of
the
power
structure
of
the
county
government,
just
like
the
mayor
and
the
city
council
and
the
aldermen.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
that's
right,
but
if
a
body--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i
don't...
in
my
understanding,
no.
that
would
be
basically
the
city
being
liable
for
the
conduct
of
one
of
its
officials,
and
when
they'll
use
this
terminology--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
and
so
in
that
sense
the
city
is
the
person
that
is
represented
by
its
official.
in
that
context
the
official--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
guess
it
would
be
the
city's
officials
making
policy
for
the
city
in
a
way
that
creates
liability
for
the
city.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
with
regard
to
state
law.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct,
because
the
county
does
engage
in
the
kind...
the
same
relationship
that
exists
between
the
county
commission,
about
whom
i
think
we'd
have
to
concede
does
have
authority
to
make
policy
that
would
create
liability
for
the
county,
the
same
relationship
between
the
county
commission
and
the
county,
that
entity.
and
you're
right,
that
county,
that
city,
can't
go
out
and
arrest
somebody,
or
subject
someone
to
the
kind
of
conduct
that
our
client
was
subjected
to.
the
same--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--because
i
think
that
the
congress
intended
to
make
localities
liable.
that
is,
the
treasury
of
the
locality
liable--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
think
two
things,
justice
scalia.
i
think
in
imagining
the
structure
of
this
corporation
we
have
to
imagine
a
board
that
has
not
only
a
county
commission
but
a
sheriff,
a
tax
assessor,
and
a
coroner,
so
in
that
sense
we're
not
asking
for
you
to
do
anything
different
than
you
would
do
in
that
traditional
context.
this
is
just
a
corporate
structure
that
has
four
elements:
a
county
commission
here,
dealing
with
one
part,
a
sheriff
over
here
dealing
with
another
part,
and
a
coroner
and
a
tax
assessor.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
think--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
that's
the
second
thing
i'd
say.
that
is,
when
congress
passed
this
law
they
made
it
clear
they
were
talking
about
bodies
politic
and
corporate
to
embrace
just
these
kinds
of
jurisdictions
where
the
power
is
separated,
where
the
power
is
directed
to
various
officials.
i
mean,
in
some
ways
it
would
be
i
think
sort
of
exceeding
the
court's
authority
to
impose
on
municipalities
a
single
view
of
governance,
that
single
view
meaning
that
you
have
to
have
a
single
corporate
body
that
makes
all
of
your
policy
decisions
in
order
for
that
municipality
to
govern.
i
mean,
alabama
has
chosen
to
divide
these
powers
in
the
ways
that
provide
the
sheriff
with
some
functions,
the
county
commission
with
some
other
functions,
and
the
tax
assessor
and
coroner
other
functions,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
law
would
require
that
to
change.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
guess
our
position
would
be
it
was
also
to
make
these
political
bodies
that
have
status,
that
have
power
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
unconstitutional
conduct,
to
empower
someone
to
do
the
kind
of
unconstitutional
conduct
that
took
place
here,
to
make
those
municipalities
liable
for
that
conduct.
tom
tate
the
individual
could
not
have
subjected
our
client
to
threats
of
summary
execution,
suppressed
the
evidence
that
resulted
in
his
wrongful
conviction
and
6
years
on
death
row
for
a
crime
he
didn't
commit
by
himself.
he
could
only
do
that
with
the
power
given
to
him
by
the
voters
of
monroe
county.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
pembaur
is
precisely
such
a
situation,
where
this
court
found
that
the
county
sheriff
and
the
district
attorney
had
final
policymaking
authority
in
the
area
of
search
and
seizure
and
arrest,
and
that
the
county
could
be
held
liable
for
that
conduct,
and
in
a
variety
of
contexts
this
court
has
done
that.
so
it's
not
a
novel
notion
to
hold
some
other
entity,
other
than
the
local
legislative
body,
as
a
final
policymaker
who
can
create
policy
that
makes...
that
binds
the
municipality
or
the
county
liable
for
that
unconstitutional
conduct,
particularly
where
here
the
ability
to
do
that
is
dependent
on
the
power,
the
authority,
the
status,
and
the
resources
provided
by
that
municipality.
i
mean,
again,
tom
tate
the
individual
could
not
have
done
what
he
did
to
petitioner
without
the
resources,
without
the
funds,
without
the
power
given
to
him
by
the
county,
and
under
those
circumstances
it's
our
view
that,
you
know,
federal
remedy
ought
not
turn
on
the
personal
sovereignty
of
the
individual
wrongdoer.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct,
in
the
same
way
that
they
have
no
authority
for
other...
over
other
county
officials,
and
in
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--and
the
resources
provided
to
him
by
the
county
commission.
that
is,
in
that
sense,
his
relationship
to
the
county...
that
is,
we
distinguish
between
the
county
commission
and
the
county,
the
body
politic.
in
that
respect
the
county
commissioners'
relationship
to
the
county
is
no
different
from
the
sheriff.
if
the
county
commission
creates
a
policy
that's
unconstitutional,
the
same
control
questions
would
exist,
the
same
access
questions
to
the
county's
treasury
would
exist.
there's
no
difference
functionally
between
the
relationship
between
the
county
commission
and
the
county
and
the
sheriff
and
the
county.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
that's
right.
he
is
the
final
policymaker
in
this
area.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
certainly.
the
policies
here.
a
policy
that
would
subject
someone
to
racial
threats
and
assaults.
a
policy
that
would
remove
them
from
the
county
jail--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
mean,
there
are
a
whole
range
of
legitimate
policies.
they
might
have
a
procedure
for
arresting
people
who
are
charged
with
dui
that
requires
that
they
either
do
a--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
absolutely,
justice
souter,
because
that
is
the
most
meaningful
control
over
this
sheriff.
this
sheriff
engaged
in
this
conduct
and
was
reelected
by
the
county.
that
election
says
something
about
the
county's
approval,
if
you
will,
of
his
conduct,
and
we
certainly
believe
that
1983
ought
to
play
a
role
in
deterring
that.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
absolutely.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
absolutely.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
they
have
no
power
to--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--like--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
like--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
think
that
removal
power
is
regulated
every
4
years.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
they
do
not,
and
every
4
years
they
will
have
the
opportunity
to
exercise
that
removal
discretion.
i'd
like
if
i
can
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i'd
like
to
at
least
suggest
that
the
court
not
accept
this
notion
that
the
sheriff
is
a
state
policymaker
under
the
law
that's
been
provided.
there
are
two
provisions
which
point
to
the
sheriff
having
some
state
identity,
the
constitutional
provision,
which
we
contend
is
a
label
and
is
at
best
ambiguous,
because
the
label
says,
sheriff
for
the
county,
and
then
the
state
tort
law
judgments,
which
we
contend
are
not
relevant
here.
the
rest
of
alabama
law
repeatedly
refers
to
the
sheriff
as
a
county
officer,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
hold
the
sheriff
makes
policy
for
the
state
precisely
because,
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
that's
kind
of
a
difficult
notion.
he
is
not
like
the
department
of
public
safety
employees
who
are
subject
to
some
state
hierarchical
command.
what
the
respondent
then
tries
to
say
is,
because
there
is
this
removal
authority,
somehow
the
state
exercises
control.
the
removal
authority
in
alabama
is
applicable
to
all
county,
municipal,
and
state
officials.
they
can
remove
a
mayor,
a
county
commissioner,
a
city
commissioner,
and
in
that
sense
does
not
help
us
resolve
this
question.
the
third
thing
is
that
we
have
identified
in
our
brief
at
pages
23
and
24
all
of
the
state
law
enforcement
provisions
that
identify
state
law
enforcement
officers.
in
those
provisions
the
sheriff
is
never
referenced,
never
included,
which
i
think
again
gives
good
evidence
as
to
why
the
sheriff
is
not
a
state
policymaker.
and
then
finally,
if
we're
not
going
to
accept
election
and
funding
and
status
as
a
county
official
as
the
governing
rationale,
then
the
county
commission's
not
a
county
official
either,
because
their
relationship
to
the
county
is
also
dependent
on
three
factors.
they're
elected,
they're
paid,
and
they're
identified
as
county
officials.
nothing
else
in
alabama
law
makes
them
any
more
of
a
county
representative
than
the
sheriff,
and
in
those
respects
we
think
it's
not
only
appropriate
but
necessary
to
hold
that
county
liable
when
its
resources
empower
somebody
like
the
sheriff
here
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
unconstitutional
conduct
against
the
petitioner
that
could
not
have
happened
but
for
those
resources.
mr.
mcmillian
would
not
have
spent
6
years
on
death
row
unless
the
county
gave
the
sheriff
the
power
to
arrest,
to
stop,
to
withhold
evidence,
and
to
do
the
other
things
that
violated
his
rights,
and
under
those
circumstances
it's
certainly
our
position
that
the
federal
remedy
ought
not
turn
on
the
personal
sovereignty
of
the
wrongdoer.
it
ought
not
turn
on
that,
because
that
wrongdoer's
conduct
was
not
made
possible
solely
by
that
wrongdoer's
initiative
or
conduct.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i'll
rest.
