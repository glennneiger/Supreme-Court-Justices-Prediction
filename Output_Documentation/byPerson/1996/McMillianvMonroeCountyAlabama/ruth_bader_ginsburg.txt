mr.
stevenson,
before
you
get
onto
the
third
thing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--staying
with
the
money,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
it's
also
the
coroner
and
the
tax
assessor
that
are
paid
by
the
county,
but
other
people
who
are
elected...
say,
the
district
attorney
or
local
judges...
are
paid
by
the
state?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
the
coroner
and
the
tax
assessor,
who
are
paid
by
the
county?
are
they
final
decisionmakers
in
their
realm,
unreviewable
by
the
commission,
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stevenson,
i
want
to
know
who
we
bracket
the
sheriff
with,
and
so
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
coroner
and
the
tax
assessor
to
see.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
same...
is
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
respondeat
superior
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
those
officers,
or
is
the
county
liable
for
their
common
law
torts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
state
does
have...
the
county
has
respondeat
superior
liability
for
the
coroner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stevenson,
do
we
have
cases
involving
actors
who
are
admittedly
county
actors
who
are
not
responsible,
not
answerable
to
any
board
of
the
county,
but
who
are...
have
been
held
final
decisionmakers
they
are,
who
trigger
monell
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
they
said
just
the
latter?
they
said,
we
want
him
to
be
autonomous
from
the
county
governing
body,
but
we're
calling
him
what
he
is,
a
county
officer
that
works
within
the
county,
not
outside,
but
he's
not
in
any
sense
answerable
to
the
commission.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
is
he
a
final
policymaker
for
the
county
for
whom
there
is
monell
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
this
person
were
designated
county
officer,
as
i
take
it
the
coroner
and
tax
assessor
are,
then
you
would
not
have
any
question
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
let's
stay
with
the
coroner
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
so...
but
you're
saying
that
that
officer
would
be
considered
a
decisionmaker,
final
decisionmaker,
although
not
responsible
to
the
county
commission,
and
there
would
be
municipal
liability
or
county
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
so
he's
not
a...
he
has
that
autonomy.
now,
what
else
would
we
look
to
to
determine
whether
he
was
a
county
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
justice
breyer
said
it
was
at
least
pay,
local
election
and
local
pay
which
would
distinguish
your
district
attorney,
a
state
judge,
and
your
legislature,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
pays
their
salary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
supplemented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
these
two
things:
election
plus
full
pay,
not
supplement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
individual
for
whom
a
county
in
alabama
would
have
monell
liability
other
than
a
member
of
the
county
commission?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
then
let
me
amend
my
question
and
say,
is
there
any
person
who
makes
final
policy,
which
i
take
it
the
sheriff
and
the
coroner
would
do
in
their
realm,
for
whom
a
county
in
alabama
would
be
liable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
the
intended,
because
we're
not
talking
about
a
particular
case.
we're
talking
about
an
office.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean
you
would
say
that
a
member
of
the
county
commission,
there
would
be
liability,
and
you
wouldn't
look
to
depend
on
the
particular
case.
we
have
all
the
law
that
there
is
about
coroners
already
on
the
books,
so
how
do...
i
mean,
you
are
very
clear
about
how
you
type
the
sheriff.
why
shouldn't
you
be
equally
clear
one
way
or
another
about
how
you
type
these
other
officers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
is
there
any
purpose
for
which
the
sheriff
ranks
as
a
county
officer?
is
there
any
capacity
in
which
under
alabama
law
he
counts
as
a
county
rather
than
a
state
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
he's
all
one
or
all
the
other,
so
there's
no
people
who
are
sometimes
county
officers
and
sometimes
state
officers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
the
supervision
out
of
it,
because
the
one
thing
that
we
have
to
have
is
a
final
policymaker,
otherwise
there's
no
case
here,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
you've
already
clarified,
i
think,
that
you
don't
have
to
have
a
policy...
a
commission
over
you
in
order
to
be
a
final
decisionmaker
for
a
county
within
monell.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
blackburn,
do
i
understand
from
your
argument
both
on
brief
and
here
this
morning
that
you
think
that
the
first
circuit
in
the
blackburn
v.
snow
case
reached
the
wrong
conclusion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the--
--what
about
the
insurance?
mr.
stevenson
mentioned
when
he
was
asked
who
would
be
liable
for
the
ordinary
torts,
and
he
said
he
thought
the
county
would
under
some
insurance
policy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they're
required
to
pay
the
salary.
