justice
david
h.
souter
are
they
elected
by
the
county?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
simply
imputed
liability?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
any
corporation
is
liable
only
by
imputation
from
its
officers,
and
the
only
reason
we're
worried
about
respondeat
superior
here
is
that
we've
got
a
case
that
says
we
don't
have
respondeat
superior
liability
under
1983
in
the
sense
that
there's
got
to
be
a
policy
condition
met,
but
respondeat
superior
is
a
variety,
certainly,
of
imputed
liability,
and
this
is
imputed
liability,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
alabama
they
say
there
is
no
imputed
liability
as
between
the
sheriff
and
the
county.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
state
law,
and
you
say
that's
a
federal
question,
and
that
does
not
bind
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
we're
interpreting
monell,
why
don't
we
use...
why
aren't
the
same
policies
that
inform
that
decision
as
to
respondeat
superior
applicable
equally
as
well
to
imputed
liability?
justice
david
h.
souter
going
back
to
the
sense
in
which
he
speaks
by
and
might
perhaps...
or
speaks
for
and
might
be
controlled
by
the
county,
the
most
important
sense,
i
suppose,
is
that
in
which
he
is
elected.
you've
given
a
whole
laundry
list
of
sort
of
characteristics
on
the
basis
of
which
you
say
we
should
conclude
that
he's
a
county
official.
would
you
put
the
fact
that
he's
elected
by
the
voters
at
the
top
of
the
list?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
if
there
were
no
basis
to
say
that
they
had
approved--
justice
david
h.
souter
--they
at
least
would
have
the
power
to
disapprove.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
suppose
that's
what
we're
getting
at
with
imputed
tort
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
they
have
to
vote
for
him
the
next
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you...
i
take
it
you
accept
the
fact
that
it's
ultimately
a
federal
question,
not
a
state
law
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
identification
of
the
policymakers
does,
but
whether,
in
fact,
the
policy
is
to
be
imputed
to
the
county,
or
to
any
municipal
corporation,
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
is
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
think
we
look
to
state
law
to
find
out
who
in
fact
has
control
over
the
policy.
who
is
in
fact
the
policymaker.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
look
to
state
law
for
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
whether
in
fact,
having
identified
the
policymaker,
the
policymaker
will
be
treated
as
a
state
official
or
as
a
municipal
official
of
some
sort,
that
is
ultimately
a
question
of
federal
law,
is
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
i
think
the
distinction
is
simple.
we
look
to
state
law
to
find
out
who,
in
fact,
under
state
law
is
setting
policy.
once
we
have
found
out
who
that
person
is,
since
there
is
a
difference
between
state
immunity
and
municipal
liability
under
1983,
we
then
say,
as
a
question
of
federal
law,
is
the
person
so
identified
a
state
officer
or
a
municipal
officer,
and
that
latter
question
is
one
of
federal
law,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
have
looked
at...
you
mean
state
law
binds
the
question
whether
for
1983
liability
an
individual
is
a
state
officer
or
a
county
officer?
i'm
not
talking
here
about
whether
it
presents
interesting
evidence.
i'm
asking
whether
it
is
dispositive,
whether
state
law
is
dispositive
on
that
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
would
have
thought
it
clearly
was
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
converse
would
not
necessarily
be
true,
would
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
he
is
not
controlled
by
in
this
case
the
county
commissioners,
it
does
not
follow
that
he
is
not
a
county
official
for
purposes
of
1983
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
only
if
they
are
executing,
on
your
view,
county
commission
policy,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
he's
consistently
treated.
he's
called
that
in
some
places.
let
me
go
back
on
the
question
of
policy
to
an
answer
you
gave
earlier.
i
think
the
hypothesis
was,
what
if
the
sheriff
doesn't
want
any
patrol
cars
on
the
roads,
and
the
attorney
general
comes
along
and
says
yes,
you
ought
to
have
cars
out
there,
or
five
cars
out
there,
or
what-not.
was
it
your
answer
that
the
attorney
general
could
make
that
policy
decision
and
make
it
binding
on
the
sheriff?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
it
would
not
give
policy
control
to
anyone
in
particular.
it
would
simply
mean
that
he
was
impeachable
by
whoever
does
impeachment
in
alabama.
i
forget
who
it
is,
but
it
would
not
follow
from
that
that
there
was
any
policy
control
from
the
impeaching
authority
to
the
sheriff,
or
else
we
would
be
subject
to
the
policy
of
the
senate.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
one...
one
reason--
--is
there
any
reason
why
the
impeaching
official
cannot
warn
the
person
who's
subject
to
impeachment,
unless
you
do
something,
i
will
impeach
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
lots
of
influence,
sure,
but
i
take
it...
i'm
sorry.
i
take
it
it's
still
your
position
that
the
impeaching
authority
in
alabama
is
not
the
policy-setting
authority
over
the
operation
of
sheriffs'
departments
in
alabama
counties.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
nobody
else
does,
so
far
as
law
enforcement
policy
by
the
sheriff's
department
for
that
county.
no
one
else
has
it,
does
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is
narrower
in
the
sense
that
there
has
got
to
be
a
policy
function
condition
met.
that
is
the
sense
in
which
it
is
narrower.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
condition
would
be
met
if,
in
fact,
the
sheriff
is
the
policymaker
for
that
county.
but
then
you
would
have...
i
don't
care
whether
you
call
it
respondeat
superior,
call
it
imputed
liability,
whatever
label
you
put
on
it,
at
that
point
1983
says
yes,
the
county
may
be
held
liable.
justice
david
h.
souter
state
law
doesn't
say
that,
but
1983
and
monell
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
nobody
at
the
state
level
can
control
the
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
everybody's
authority
under
alabama
law,
or
i
presume
the
law
of
any
other
state,
is
ultimately,
if...
is
ultimately
delegated
by
state
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
counties
have
the
authority
that
state
law
gives
them.
governors
do.
sheriffs
do.
so
the
fact
that
there
is
ultimately
a
state
law
answer
to
who
has
the
policymaking
authority
and
what
is
its
extent,
that
doesn't
get
you
anywhere
for
monell
purposes,
because
that's
a
wash
item.
that's
going
to
be
true
everywhere,
all
the
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
content
of
state
law.
mr.
smith,
let
me
be
sure
i
got
one
point
in
mind.
you
say
because
he's
a
state
official
he's
implementing
state
policies
when
he
decides
how
many
patrol
cars
to
put
out
and
so
forth,
but
that
means,
then,
if
i
understand
you,
all
67
sheriffs
have
different
policies
within
their
own
countries.
you
have
67
different
state
policies
because
they're
all
state
officials.
