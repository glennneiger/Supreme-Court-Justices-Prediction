mr.
smith,
your
second
point,
as
i
understand
it,
was
the
label
itself
is
not
enough.
you
couldn't
just
pass
a
statute
calling
somebody
a
state
officer,
as
i
understand
you.
you
look
at
actual
control
to
have
significance,
and
in
this
case
if
you
ask
about
the
day-to-day
activities
of
the
sheriff,
not
things
that
would
justify
impeachment
or
failure
to
reelect,
but
whether
he
assigns
four
officers
to
a
district
or
two
patrol
cars
and
so
forth,
who
controls
him
in
that
regard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
law
officer's
activites,
assigning
his
a
personnel
to
different
tasks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
the
final
authority
on
those
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
assigning
policemen
to
arrest
people,
and
what
part
of
the
city
to
patrol,
and
how
long
hours
they
work
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
the
final
authority
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
has
to
do
something
sufficiently
serious
to
justify
impeachment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just
working
8
hours
instead
of
9
hours,
or
7
hours
instead
of
6,
that
sort
of
thing
he's
the
boss.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
how
often
are
these
county
officials
impeached?
very
rarely,
i
assume,
but
they
run
their
offices
8
hours
a
day,
7
days
a
week,
30
days
a
month,
and
they
make
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
decisions
that
are
not
supervised
by
anyone
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
would
they
do
that?
why
would
they
buy
the
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
have
no
interest
in
law
enforcement,
why
would
they
buy
this
insurance?
