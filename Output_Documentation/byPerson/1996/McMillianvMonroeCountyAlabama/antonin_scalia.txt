justice
antonin
scalia
what
else
is
there?
i
really
don't
see
what
else
you
rely
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
county
does
this,
but
the
county
does
this
under
compulsion
of
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
directed
by
state
law.
it's
not
a
matter
of
self-governance
in
which
the
county
decides,
we
will
provide
so
much
money
to
the
sheriff.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
state,
but
not
in
all
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
states
do
have
charters
in
which
the
counties
are
self-governing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
knew
you'd
get
back
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now,
wait,
let's
talk
about
the
third
for
a
minute.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
anything
other
than
the
sheriff
has
no
authority
outside
the
geographical
limits
of
the
county?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
that
makes
him
necessarily
a
county
official.
certainly
you
can
have
state
officials,
each
of
whom
has
jurisdiction
within
each
of
the
various
counties.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
prosecutors
you
referred
to
earlier,
the
state
prosecutors,
whose
jurisdiction
exceeds
the
county
but
does
not
exceed
the
judicial
district.
can
they
be
moved
to
another
judicial
district?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
any
different
from
the
sheriff
of
one
county
being
able
to
enter
into
another
county
in
hot
pursuit?
do
you
have
any
hot
pursuit
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
instances
you
were
describing
of
the
prosecutors
being
able
to
act
elsewhere
were
also
exceptional
instances.
basically,
they
were
limited
to
the
judicial
district
to
which
they're
assigned.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
intended
to
make
municipalities
liable
because
they
were
like
corporations.
that's
why
we
decided
monell
the
way
we
did,
that
in
fact
they
were
municipal
corporations,
but
surely
it
is
an
essential
characteristic
of
a
corporation
that
its
board
of
directors
can
decide
what
happens
within
that
corporation.
but
you're
coming
before
us
here
and
saying
that
this
is
a
corporation
which
should
be
liable
under
1983.
however,
the
sheriff
is
not
subject
to
the
commands
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
corporation,
namely
the
governing
body
of
the
county.
that's
what
troubles
me
the
most,
that
this
doesn't
fit
into
the
whole
theory
of
section
1983
liability
for
municipalities,
which
is
that
they
are
like
corporations.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
just
a
corporate
structure
that
has
four
elements.
that's
a
corporation
i
never
heard
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it's
just
a
person
that
has
four
heads.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
decision
was
not
to
make
counties
liable.
that
was
not
the
1983
decision.
the
decision
was
to
make
corporations
liable.
counties
became
liable
only
because
they
were
corporations.
that
was
the
whole
basis
of
our
analysis.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
there's
another--
--the
sheriff
does
not
enforce
county
law.
i
mean,
the
county
doesn't
make
policy
in
the
sense
of
enacting
any
ordinances
which
the
sheriff
enforces.
he
enforces
only
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
doesn't
make
any
policy
in
the
sense
of
controlling
his
actions,
either.
it
can't
give
him
any
directions,
can
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they
disapprove?
they
have
no
power
to
impeach
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
impeached
by
state
officers,
isn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
the
attorney
general,
or
the
legislature?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
really
have
a...
i
mean,
gee,
the
power
just
to
elect
somebody
without
the
power
to
remove
him--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
know
that
that's
real
control.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
mean,
within
the
confines
of.
isn't
anyone
ultimately
within
the
supervision
and
control
of
whoever
has
power
to
remove
him
from
office?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
sheriff,
for
example,
decides
to
have
ho
police
cars,
and
the
attorney
general
says,
we
have
a
whole
county
here
that
is
not
being
policed,
they
have
no
police
cars,
wouldn't
the
attorney
general
tell
the
sheriff,
get
some
police
cars
or
you're
out
of
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you're--
--mr.
smith,
i
assume
that
the
members
of
the
alabama
legislature,
are
they
elected
locally?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
can
they
be
removed
from
office
by
the
local
voters?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
are
they
considered
local
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
senate
can't
do
that
to
us,
presumably,
but
that
has
to
do
with
the
separation
of
powers.
could
the
senate
do
that
to
a
senatorial...
a
congressional
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
can
you
tell
me
again
what
are
the...
you
say
in
some
respects
the
sheriff...
in
some
of
his
activities
he
is
supervised
by
other
state
officers--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
in
none
of
his
activities
is
he
supervised
by
county
officials.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
ones
is
he
supervised
by--
