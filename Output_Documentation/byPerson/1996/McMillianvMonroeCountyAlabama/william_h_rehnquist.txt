chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-542,
walter
mcmillian
v.
monroe
county,
alabama.
mr.
stevenson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
suggest
perhaps
in
other
alabama
counties
there
might
not
be
an
insurance
policy--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
county
commission,
then...
and
that's
your
form
of
county
government
in
alabama?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--could
not
instruct
the
tax
assessor
to
do
things
in
a
particular
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
asking
us
to
hold
the
county
liable
for
the
actions
of
the
sheriff.
it's
not
as
if
you
were
saying,
we're
just
after
the
sheriff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
respondeat
superior
in
a
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out
in
his
question
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
said
he
is
not
a
county
official
for
tort
purposes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
is
a
constitutional
tort
that
you're
suing
for,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
the
county
commission
has
no
authority
over
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
to
say
that
he
couldn't
have
done
what
he
did
without
the
county
really
is
not
quite
accurate.
he
couldn't
have
done
what
he
did
without
the
authority
vested
in
him
by
the
alabama
statutes
to
be
a
law
enforcer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
stevenson.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--you
could
say
the
same
thing,
i
suppose,
about
the
local
district
attorney,
or
the
local
judges
of
the
circuit
that
the
county
people
vote
for.
if
they
had
a
certain
platform
you
could
say
that
that
was
the
county
or
the
circuit's
policy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
stevenson,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stevenson.
the
case
is
submitted.
