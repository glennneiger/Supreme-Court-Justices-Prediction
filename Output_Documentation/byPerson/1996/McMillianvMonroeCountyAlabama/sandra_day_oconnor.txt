o'connor
well,
mr.
stevenson,
i
assume
that
the
plaintiff
here
also
sued
the
sheriff.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
there's
a
judgment
against
the
sheriff,
who
pays
it
in
alabama?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
can
join
the
county?
if
you're
going
to
get
a
judgment
against
the
sheriff
anyway,
and
it's
going
to
be
paid,
what
do
you
care?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
if
you
sue
the
sheriff
and
get
a
judgment,
somehow
that
money
is
going
to
be
produced
to
pay
the
judgment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
has
there
ever
been
a
judgment
against
a
sheriff
in
alabama
in
a
civil
case
or
a
1983
case
in
the
history
of
alabama?
has
there
ever
been
a
civil
judgment
against
the
sheriff
in
his
capacity
as
sheriff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
have
the
judgments
been
paid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
have
they
been
paid,
somehow?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
it
was
given
to
him
by
state
law,
or
by
the
state
constitution.
certainly
the
sheriff
had
the
power
and
the
authority
to
take
the
actions
apparently
that
he
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
smith,
if
you're
right
and
the
sheriff
in
alabama
is
purely
a
state
official,
then
should
the
action
have
been
dismissed
against...
insofar
as
it
was
brought
against
the
sheriff--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
1983?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
in
his
official
capacity--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
your
position.
