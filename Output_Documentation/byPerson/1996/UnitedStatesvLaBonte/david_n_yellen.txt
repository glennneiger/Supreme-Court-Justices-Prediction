mr.
david
n.
yellen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer's
colloquy
with
mr.
dreeben
i
think
fairly
clearly
points
out
that
there
are
various
ways
of
reading
the
language
of
the
maximum
term
authorized
for
categories
of
offenders,
and
a
critical
point
that
did
not
come
out
in
the
government's
argument
is
that
congress
considered
and
expressly
rejected
giving
a
directive
to
sentencing
courts
to
impose
a
maximum,
ordinary
maximum
term.
that
was
in
the
1982
bill
that
passed
the
senate
but
the
senate
the
next
time,
the
next
year
rejected
that
and
instead
gave
this
more
general
instruction
to
the
sentencing
commission,
putting
this
obligation
under
994(h)
in
the
context
of
all
of
the
commission's
obligations.
and
what
the
sentencing
commission
did
here
was
looked
at
all
of
its
obligations,
including
first
and
foremost
under
the
statute
to
provide
certainty
and
fairness
and
reducing
unwarranted
sentencing
disparity,
and
the
commission
decided
that
the
prosecutor
having
the
ability
to
in
effect
determine
the
sentence
by
this
851
mechanism
was
something
that
would
contribute
to
unwarranted
disparity.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
mr.
chief
justice,
the
discretion
that
the
prosecutor
has
under
851
and
841
is
to
raise
the
ceiling,
to
raise
the
maximum
term
allowed,
and
it's
then
not
up
to
the
prosecutor
to
decide
what
the
actual
sentence
is.
that's
the
way
the
851
mechanism
has
always
worked.
it
authorizes
the
judge
to
apply...
to
impose
a
sentence
longer
than
the
unenhanced
maximum
but
only
if
it's
a
truly
bad
case
that
warrants
a
longer
sentence.
if
congress
wishes
to
impose
a
specific
sentence
enhancement,
they
know
how
to
do
that.
they've
passed
mandatory
minimums,
and
they've
passed
mandatory
sentences.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
that's
right,
and
994(h)
directs
a
sentence
at
or
near
the
maximum
applicable
to
the
categories
of
defendants,
not
defined
clearly
as
mr.
dreeben
suggested
in
this
statute,
but
very
broadly.
i
think
it's
quite
plausible
to
read
that
language
to
say
that
one
way
to
categorize
all
of
the
offenders
defined
in
994(h)
is
to
take
everyone
who's
been
convicted
of
violating
the
same
statute
and
treat
them
as
one
category,
and
then
those
defendants
against
whom
the
government
has
filed
851
information
and
are
therefore
eligible
for,
say
a
30-year
sentence
rather
than
a
20-year
sentence,
they
will
receive
that
longer
sentence
if
there
are
aggravating
factors--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--under
the
guidelines
or
aggravating
factors
that
warrant
a
departure
above
the
guidelines.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
well,
justice
souter,
the
discretion...
the
prosecutorial
discretion
that
congress
has
said
is
a
good
thing
is
the
prosecutor's
discretion
to
seek
a
higher
maximum
term,
not
to
seek
a
higher
specific
term.
the
851
mechanism,
the
way
it
always
worked
before
the
guidelines
came
into
effect
and
the
way
it
continues
to
work
today
for
people
who
are
not
career
offenders
is
that
the
filing
of
the
information
allows
a
sentence
of
more
than
20,
to
use
the
facts
of
these
cases,
and
up
to
30
years,
but
not
automatically
at
the
prosecutor's
choice.
the
prosecutor
gets
to--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--but
the
effect
is
still
there,
the
effect
of
raising
the
ceiling,
that
all
of
the
defenders
in
this
case
could
have
received
sentences...
under
the
commission's
amendment
506
they
could
have
received
sentences
longer
than
20
years,
up
to
and
including
30
years,
if,
as
is
very
commonly
the
case
with
career
offenders,
there
was
a
large
quantity
of
drugs,
or
there
was
the
use
of
a
gun,
or
there
were
any
other
aggravating
factors.
if
i
could
answer
justice
stevens'
question
before
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
because
i
think
it
illustrates
something
here,
this
was
not
a
threefold
increase
from
the
original
guideline
range
based
on
amendment
506
interpretation
of
the
career
offender
level,
but
in
respondent
dyer's
case
it
was
a
13-fold
increase.
it
took...
the
regular
guideline
range
for
dyer
was
18
to
24
months.
after
applying
the
career
offender
guideline
with
amendment
506
the
range
would
be
210
months
to
262
months,
a
13-fold
increase.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--one
was
another
drug
offense
and
one
was
a
commercial
burglary
that
the
lower
court
considered
to
be
a
crime
of
violence.
but
even
including
all
of
his
prior
criminal
record
he
was
a
category
6
under
the
guidelines,
but
his
drug
offense
on
this
occasion
was
so
minor
that
the
sentencing
guideline
said
even
though
you're
in
the
highest
criminal
history
category,
your
guideline
range
is
18
to
24
months,
but
because
you're
a
career
offender,
it
now
goes
all
the
way
up
to
210
months
to--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--justice
scalia,
i'm
not
saying
it's
unwise
at
all.
in
fact,
my...
the
numbers
i
gave
you,
210
to
262,
that's
the
range
that
mr.
dyer
will
be
eligible
for
on
remand
if
we
win
here,
so
if
we
prevail
in
this
case
the
commission's--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--his
sentence--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--certainly,
i
understand
that
position
completely,
but
the
issue
here
is
not
what
any
member
of
this
court
thinks
is
the
appropriate
sentence,
of
course,
but
did
congress
intend
precisely
to
answer
this
question
about--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--i
don't
suggest
that
they--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--congress
has
certainly
enacted
statutes
that
are
more
punitive
than
this.
i
agree
completely,
but--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--yes.
i
think
the
question
here
is
not
what
is
the
fairest
reading
of
the
statute,
but
has
the
commission
engaged
in
a
permissible
reading
of
the
statute,
and
that's
a
very
different
question,
and
i
think
in
this
case
the
commission
clearly
has
engaged
in
a
permissible
reading
of
this
statute.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
the
court
has
not
said
that
specifically,
but
the
lower
courts
have
generally
said
that
and
the
statute,
994(h)
in
particular,
instructing
the
commission
to
do
all
of
these
things,
says
quite
clearly
that
the
commission
has
very
broad
authority.
and
whether
or
not
chevron
per
se
applied,
in
a
case
like
this
where
congress
has
said
in
so
many
words
that
the
commission
has
a
great
deal
of
authority
to
make
decisions
that
used
to
be
made
much
more
independently
by
individual
sentencing
judges
and
individual
prosecutors,
i
think
deference
to
the
commission
is
entirely
consistent
with
chevron
and
other...
and
well-established
principles.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
no,
justice
ginsburg,
i
disagree
with
that,
and
maybe
i
haven't
said
it
clearly.
i'll
try
again.
i
disagree
with
that
very
strongly.
when
the
sentence
enhancements
of
841
with
the
851
mechanism
were
enacted,
what
it
did
was,
if
the
prosecutor
files
under
851
the
maximum
is
higher.
before
the
guidelines,
no
defendant
was
required
ever
to
receive
one
day
longer
in
prison
because
the
prosecutor
bumped
up
the
maximum.
that
was
up
to
the
judge,
and
that's
the
way
that
rule
continues
to
exist
today
for
people
who
are
not
career
offenders.
so
under
the
commission's
interpretation
of
section
4b1.1,
it
works
like
this.
the
defendant
committed
a
crime
that
would
have
had
a
20-year
maximum.
because
of
his
prior
record
and
the
government's
filing
under
851,
he
now
could
receive
a
30-year
sentence.
the
guideline
is
based
on
the
20-year
maximum,
but
if
there
are
any
aggravating
factors
in
the
case
that
make
him
a
worse
than
normal
offender...
large
amount
of
drugs,
use
of
a
weapon,
a
leadership
role
in
the
offense,
or
anything
else
that
the
guidelines
don't
consider
which
warrant
a
departure...
the
judge
can
impose
a
sentence
above
the
career
offender
level,
above
20
years
all
the
way
up
to
30
years,
so
in
fact
it's
the
government's
view
of
the
case
that
would
dramatically
alter
the
intended
effect
of
an
851
filing.
congress
in
851
isn't
saying
we
want
prosecutors
to
have
the
power
to
set
sentences.
they're
saying
we
want
prosecutors
to
have
the
power
to
raise
the
maximum,
and
it's
up
to
the
other
actors
in
the
system,
judges
and
now
the
sentencing
commission--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--they're
only
alike
as
a
starting
point.
the
way
the
career
offender
guideline
works
is,
you
get
a
level
32.
but
you
only
get
a
level
32
if
the
regular
application
of
the
guidelines
isn't
higher.
the
judge
also
has
to
go
through
the
regular
routine
rules
of
the
guidelines...
look
at
the
amount
of
drugs,
the
use
of
a
weapon,
injury,
leadership
role...
and
if
that
comes
out
to
a
level
34
or
5
or
6,
that's
the
sentence
the
judge
must
impose,
not
the
level
32
that
the
career
offender
guideline
points
to.
secondly,
if
there
are
other
aggravating
factors
that
the
guidelines
don't
take
into
account,
the
judge
can
decide
under
the
standards
in
koon
that
this
is
a
case
that
warrants
an
upward
departure,
so
level
32
isn't
high
enough
because
this
guy
is
not
only
a
career
offender
but
he's
got
a
criminal
record
a
mile
long,
and
therefore
level
32
is
not
enough.
i
want
to
go
all
the
way
up
to
30
years.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
that's
right,
and
the
commission's
rationale
for
that
is
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
invite
unwarranted
disparity.
we've
provided
records
from
the
sentencing
commission--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--in
the
commission's
view
it's
unwarranted
because
you
have,
under
the
government's
view
of
the
statute,
two
defendants
who
have
committed
the
same
crime.
they
have
the
same
criminal
record.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
defendant
in
one
of
the
cases
is
one
of
the
2.5
percent
of
eligible
people
against
whom
the
government
has
filed--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--it
is,
because
congress
has
not
expressly
answered
this
question
before
the
court.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
the
specific
authorization
to
prosecutors
in
851,
as
i've
tried
to
suggest,
doesn't
mandate
any
sentencing--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--in
a
certain
number
of
cases.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
in
the
worst
cases.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
i
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
souter--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--yes.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
yes,
and
it
gets
to
the--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--it
gets
to
what
congress
did
here.
when
congress
raises--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--the
maximum
sentence--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--yes.
the...
i...
the
way
the
law
works
is
that
when
a
prosecutor
seeks
an
enhanced
maximum
it
does
not
automatically
enhance
the
sentence.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
right.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
no.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
no,
it
is
not,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
i
would
disagree
that
these
cases
are
rare,
where
we
have
serious
drug
offenders
and
violent
offenders.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
the
judge
would
want
to
exercise
his
discretion
to
go
higher
and
is
able
to
under
the
guidelines,
but
the
judge
can
only
do
that
under
the
system
of
guidelines
if
there
is
an
aggravating
factor
in
the
guidelines
or
a
basis
for
a
departure,
so
the
commission's
reading...
the
commission's
implementation
of
4b1.1
doesn't
change
that
at
all.
all
unwarranted
disparity
that
congress
was
after
came
from
the
exercise
of
lawful
discretion.
congress
was
concerned
about
judicial
discretion,
the
impact
it
had
on
disparity,
but
that
was
lawful,
all
lawful
exercise
of
discretion.
similarly
here,
prosecutors
can
through
their
exercise
of
discretion
wind
up
with
disparities
that
the
commission
is
charged
with
trying
to
regulate.
i
was
mentioning
before
that
in
only
2.5
percent
of
all
cases,
according
to
sentencing
commission
data
that
we
submitted
to
the
court,
does
the
government
seek
these
enhanced
maximums,
so
you
wind
up
with
a
case
where
two
defendants
who
have
committed
the
same
violation
and
have
the
same
criminal
record
can
get
vastly
different
sentences,
not
because
the
judge
or
the
sentencing
commission
thinks
that
any
difference
is
appropriate,
but
rather
simply
because
the
government
has
filed
the
enhancement.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
but
congress
authorized
them
to
increase
the
maximums,
not
to
increase
the
sentence.
congress
has
on
many
occasions
given
prosecutors
the
tools
to
actually
increase
sentences.
the
government
can
get
a
mandatory--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--absolutely,
under
the
guideline
that
we're
defending.
that's
exactly
the
result.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
i
think
that
would
be
a
permissible
reading,
but
my
view
of
it
doesn't
matter.
what
matters
is
the
sentencing
commission,
which
has
been
delegated
this
authority,
has
said
that
we
think
this
is
the
logical,
rational--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
very
logical
to
say,
as
the
commission
did,
that
the
most
important
category
is
what
is
the
crime
you
committed,
and
what
is
your
criminal
record?
that's
the
whole
structure
of
the
guidelines,
so
what
they
did
here
was
really
try
and
integrate
the
career
offender
provision
into
the
overall
stru
ture.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
well,
in
fact
the
commission
is
there
deferring
to
congress.
congress
has
said
drug
amounts
matter
a
lot,
and
it
would
have
been
more
presumptuous
of
the
commission
to
say
that--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--justice
ginsburg,
it
does
not
nullify
the
prosecutor's
choice.
it
nullifies
the
automatic
sentence
enhancement
effect
of
the
prosecutor's
choice
that
the
government
asks
for,
but
it
does
not
at
all
nullify
the
effect
of
the
prosecutor's
choice--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--well,
there's
not
one
statute
here,
of
course.
you're
talking
about
the
relationships
between
two
statutes,
851,
which
is
the
mechanism
for
the
prosecutor
to
get
the
enhancement,
and
then
there's
994(h),
which
directs
the
sentencing
commission
to
devise
a
guideline
at
or
near
the
maximum.
851
does
not
authorize
the
government
to
obtain
a
higher
sentence.
if
they
have
that
power
under
the
government's
view
it's
only
because
994(h)
mandates
it.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
no,
justice
souter.
the--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--the...
when
the
government
files
under
851
the
authorization
is
there
to
impose
a
30-year
sentence.
the
court
has
that
power,
and
the
court
will
do
that
if
it
either
exercises
its
discretion
to
depart,
or
if
there
are
aggravating--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--no,
justice
souter.
maybe
i
didn't
explain
this
well.
the
career
offender
guidelines
presents
an
alternative
method
of
computing
the
guideline
sentence.
for
these
defendants
under
amendment
506
the
career
offender
level
is
32
criminal
history
category
6,
okay,
which
is
210
months
to
262
months,
but
the
judge
can...
is
required
to
compute
the
guideline
range
without
regard
to
the
career
offender
guideline,
look
at
the
amount
of
drugs,
the
weapon,
and
all
of
the
other
factors.
and
the
way
the
guidelines
were
written,
in
many
cases,
particularly
for
career
offenders
who
have
long
criminal
records
and
are
likely
to
be
involved
in
very
serious
drug
crimes,
unlike
the
respondents
in
this
case,
those
offenders
will
very
often
have
guideline
ranges
that
are
above
the
unenhanced
statutory
minimum.
mr.
david
n.
yellen
and
again
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
souter.
if
you're
at
level
32
and
you
have
no
enhancement
motion
filed
under
851
the
maximum
is
20
years,
or
240
months,
so
you
could
not
even
go
to
the
top
of
the
guideline
range
lawfully,
the
level
32.
you
could
not
go
to
262
months.
you
would
be
capped,
the
judge
would
be
capped
at
240
months.
if
the
government
has
filed
under
851,
now
the
judge
can
go
above
240
months
all
the
way
up
to
360
months,
so
it
retains...
the
effect
of
the
enhanced
maximum
remains
precisely
the
way
it
has
always
operated,
and
operates
for
anyone
who
is
not
a
career
offender.
the...
i
hope
i've
explained
that
clearly.
the--
mr.
david
n.
yellen
--it
will...
yes.
longer
sentences
will
be
less
common
under
the
commission's
amendment,
absolutely.
but
the
question
here
is
not
whether
that's
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea
but
whether,
rather
looking
at
the
sentencing
format
in
its
entirety,
and
all
the
commission's
obligations,
it's
a
decision
that
it
would
have
the
authority
to
make,
and
again
i
point
to
the
fact
that
congress
specifically
decided
to
frame
this
as
a
general
instruction
to
the
commission
and
introduce
the
concept
of
categories.
the
government's
reading
of
this
statute
completely
eliminates
the
meaning
of
the
word
categories.
it
reads
as
if
the
commission
was
directed
to
call
for
a
sentence
at
or
near
the
maximum
for
any
defendant
who
is
18
years
of
age
or
older,
and
congress
had
to
mean
something
by--
