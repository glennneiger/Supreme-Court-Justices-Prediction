your
position
is
that
maximum
means
maximum.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
yellen,
why
is
that
unthinkable?
i
mean,
there
are
jurisdictions
in
the
country
which
are
passing
things
called
three-strikes-you're-out
laws.
now,
they
may
be
wise,
they
may
be
unwise,
and
in
those
cases,
i
mean,
you're
out,
it
means
you're
in
permanently.
they
may
be
very
unwise,
but
i
don't
know
that
i
can
say
that
when
that
seems
to
be
the
fairest
reading
of
the
statute
as
a
judge
i
can
say
well,
since
it's
unwise
i'm
not
going
to
adopt
the
fairest
reading.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
give
me
the
more
horrible
example
that
will
apply
if
you
will
lose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
will
make
the
same
comment.
you
know,
it
may
be
very
unwise,
but
is
that
the
fairest
reading
of
the
statute
is
the
question
before
us,
and
if
the
fairest
reading
is
three
strikes
you're
out
and
you're
in
jail
permanently,
so
be
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
i'm
not
shocked
by
the
notion
that
they
would
have
been...
much
of
your
argument
has
gone
to
that
congress
couldn't
have
meant
to
increase
the
sentence.
they
very
well
may
have
meant
that.
many
states
have
done
worse.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
better,
depending
on
whether
you
like
it
or
don't
like
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
yellen,
i'm...
explain
to
me
why
it
is
that
the
only
thing
you
excise
from
the
precise
offense
for
which
the
individual
is
being
sentenced
is
this
element
that
the
prosecutor
has
the
ability
to
increase
or
not
to
increase.
why
is
it
not
the
case,
as
mr.
dreeben
was
saying,
that
if
you're
going
to
be
consistent
you
would
have
to
excise
from
the
particular
characteristics
of
the
defendant's
crime
other
elements
as
well,
so
that
if
you're
doing
841,
for
example,
you
would
not
be
able
to
include
the
particularized
factors
of
how
many
grams,
or
what
kind
of
a
drug?
why
aren't
those
factors
equally
particularizing,
and
if
you're
going
to
be
consistent
as
to
the
meaning
of...
well,
are
you
using
the
phrase
categories,
or
whether
you're
relying
on
that
or
not,
why
doesn't
it
bring
you
all
the
way
down
to
the
most
minimum
offense
possible
under
841?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
it's
logical.
i
mean,
i
can
see
how
that
reading
is
logical,
produces
an
extraordinary
result,
and
i
can
see
how
the
government's
reading
is
logical,
but
i
can't
see
how
something
in
the
middle...
we're
going
to
pick
and
choose
among
the
individuating
characteristics
of
the
crime.
i
think
you
can
say
none
of
the
individuating
characteristics
is
taken
account
of.
it's
only
the
base
crime,
and
therefore
you
end
up
with
nothing
but
a
3-year
sentence
under
841.
or
you
can
say
everything's
included,
which
is
the
way
the
government
does
it.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly
say,
we're
going
to
pick
something
in
between.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when
you
say
what
is
the
crime
you
committed,
you're
willing
to
include
within
the
crime
you
committed
many
factors
that
are
not
within
the
base
crime.
what?
such
as,
the
crime
under
841
is,
knowingly
or
intentionally
manufacture,
distribute,
to
create,
distribute,
dispense.
that's
the
base
crime.
and
then
you
get
different
sentences
under
841(b),
depending
upon
how
many
grams,
what
kind
of
a
drug,
and
so
forth.
those
are
all
individuating
characteristics.
now,
i
can
see
taking
them
all
into
account
or
taking
none
of
them
into
account,
but
to
sort
of
arbitrarily
say
we're
going
to
take
into
account
some
and
not
others
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
manner
of
interpreting
the
statute,
but
a
matter
of
writing
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
is
the
effect
that
the
statute
prescribes.
i
mean,
you
say...
in
other
words,
in
the
automatic
sense,
it
has
been
effective;
what
the
statute
prescribes
is
that
the
sentence
will
be
enhanced
automatically.
