justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
fact
question
before
you
get
too
deeply
into
the
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
under
the
career
view
of
the
statute
the
maximum
is
30
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's...
under
the
commission's
view
the
maximum
is
20
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you're
not
taking
into
the
career
offender
factors
there.
what
would
the
guideline
sentence
have
been
when
you...
without
a
requirement
that
it
be
at
or
near
the
maximum,
under
a
20-year
maximum?
do
you
understand
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
have
been
roughly
a
third,
or...
a
third
or
a
half,
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if...
so
in
other
words,
if
it
was
a
third
it
might
have
been
7
or
8
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas...
and
if
you
then
say
that
you
should
take...
and
the
normal
third
of
the
30
years
would
have
been
10
years,
absent
the
requirement
that
it
be
at
or
near
the
maximum,
but
now
the...
under
the
commission's
view
it
is
at
or
near
the
maximum
of
20
years
because
of
the
guideline
provision,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that,
but
even
interpreting
the
at
or
near
maximum
the
way
the
commission
does,
you
do
get
a
substantially
higher
sentence
for
a
career
offender
than
you
would
absent
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
