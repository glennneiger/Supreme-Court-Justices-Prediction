--under
that
reading,
why
do
you
need
the
word
categories?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
speculated
that
what
you
had
in
mind...
maybe
this
is
the
first
thing
you
said...
is
that
the
commission
could
say
criminal
history...
essentially
criminal
history
is
not
relevant
in
the
guidelines
when
you
have
a
maximum
term
under
this
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
said
the
commission
enjoys
full-fledged
chevron
deference?
