justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
that
goes
to
explain
the
ambiguity,
i
guess,
but
even
assuming
the
ambiguity...
i
do
assume
the
ambiguity...
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
why
the
authorization
would
be
to
eliminate
the
possibility,
if
not
the
effect
of
prosecutorial
discretion
when
congress
has
expressly
granted
prosecutorial
discretion.
congress
in
effect
says
prosecutorial
discretion
is
a
good
thing.
why,
therefore,
is
it
appropriate
for
the
commission
to
say
we
should
somehow,
if
not
eliminate,
at
least
liminate...
limit
the
effects
of
this
discretion
which
congress
has
expressly
conferred?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
quite
true,
but
the
presumed
effect
will
be,
by
giving
prosecutors
that
discretion
and
by
giving
courts
authority
based
upon
the
prosecutorial
exercise
of
that
discretion,
the
natural
effect
in
the
mind
run
of
cases
will
be
to
increase
sentences,
and
why
should...
why
is
it
an
appropriate
policy
to
eliminate
an
effect
which
has
so
explicitly
been
granted
and,
i
have
to
assume,
intended?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
is
the
disparity
unwarranted
when
the
authority
which
is
the
predicate
of
the
disparity...
that
is,
the
prosecutor's
discretion...
is
specifically
conferred
by
law?
why
does
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
say
that
that
is
an
unwarranted
disparity?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
think
i
understand
that.
the
commission
i
take
it
is
really
saying,
look,
we
have
an
obligation
here
within
certain
limits
to
equalize
sentences
for
given
offenses,
and
we're
taking
that
obligation
seriously.
but
in
taking
that
obligation
seriously,
as
they
do
here,
they
are
in
effect
saying
the
obligation
to
equalize
sentences
for
a
given
offense,
forgetting
extraneous
details
which
might
raise
it
up
or
raise
it
down,
is
more
important
than
the
effect
of
the
specifically
conferred
prosecutorial
discretion
in
authorizing
judges
to
go
higher
than
they
might
otherwise
do
for
that
offense.
is
that
a
legitimate
choice
for
the
commission
to
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
hasn't
expressly
answered
it,
but
what
it
has
done
is
to
give
a
general
rule
and
then
a
very
specific
authorization
to
prosecutors,
which
will
in
the
natural
course
have
an
effect
of
creating,
in
fact,
two
different
levels
of
sentencing
for
the
base
offense,
and
don't
we
generally
say
the
specific
governs
the
general,
and
if
that's
the
case
here,
does
the
commission
really
have
a
legitimate
option
to
say
no,
we
think
the
general
philosophy
is
more
important
than
the
effect
of
the
specific
authorization
to
prosecutors?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
mandate
it,
but
its
natural
effect
is
to
facilitate
it,
and
it
must
have
been
the
intention
of
congress
that
in
a
certain
number
of
cases
that
judicial
option
would
be
exercised.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
effect
of
the
commission's
interpretation
here
is
to
minimize
or
to
nullify
the
effect
of
that
discretion
which
the
court
has
as
a
result
of
the
prosecutorial
discretion.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that
was
the
premise
of
justice
ginsburg's
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
make
the
same
assumption.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
are
we
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but--
--no.
justice
david
h.
souter
no...
answer
the
question.
i
think
you're
not
answering
the
question.
i
want
to
hear
what
you
say,
but
before
you
get
there,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
seem
to
be
making
in
your
view
just
an
incorrect
assumption
about
how
the
law
works
in
fact,
and
if
we
are
wrong,
we
need
to
know
that
first.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
in
those
cases
in
which
the
judge
says
i
am
going
to
exercise
this
authority
which
the
prosecutorial
option
has
provided
me
with--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i'm
going
to
impose
a
higher
sentence
than
i
would
otherwise
do,
in
those
cases,
isn't
it
true
that
the
commission's
interpretation
either
minimizes
or
nullifies,
i'm
not
mathematically
sure
how
it
works,
the
effect
of
the
judge's
option
which
he's
exercised
or
she's
exercised
to
go
higher?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
that's
what
we
need
to
understand.
the
strongest
argument...
i
think
this
is
the
same
point,
but
i
thought
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
the
sg
made
was
in
the
very
same
statute
where
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
enacted
into
law,
there...
congress
enacted
a
provision
that
said
20
years
for
a
first
offender,
being
cocaine,
or...
up
to
20
years,
or
up
to
40
years
for
a
second,
okay.
now,
why
would
they
have
done
that
if,
in
fact,
this
provision
that
we're
talking
about
is
keyed
to
the
first
offense,
because
the
provision
keyed
to
the
first
offense
would
have
given
everybody,
everybody
who
is
the
second
offender
the
20
years
that's
the
max
for
the
first
offender?
and
your
response
to
that
is,
oh,
but
there
are
some
cases
where
you
would
have
wanted
to
go
higher,
namely
a
case
of
a
departure,
or
a
case
where
the
underlying
substantive
offense
is
in
fact
like
distributing
a
pound
of
crack
in
a
prison
with
a
gun,
so
you
get
to
level
36
or
38
anyway.
at
which
point
justice
souter
says,
yes,
that's
true,
i'm
not
saying
there
are
no
such
cases,
but
there
are
so
few
that
how
could
we
really
think
that
congress
meant
the
interpretation
that
you're
advancing,
or
wouldn't
it
have
viewed
this
as
a
kind
of
unnecessary
provision
to
stick
in?
am
i...
i'm
trying
to
basically
rephrase,
perhaps
not
as
articulately
as
the
sg
phrased...
in
other
words...
all
right.
i
intended
to
help.
i
don't
know
if
i
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
let's
just
change
the
phraseology.
it
authorizes
the
court
to
impose
a
higher
sentence,
and
that
authorization
is
effectively
eliminated.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
effect
of
that,
when
the
court
then
switches
to
the
career
offender
provisions,
is
effectively
nullified,
is
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
you're
saying
that
there
are
bases
other
than
the
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
to
file
the
information
upon
which
the
court
may
nonetheless
raise
the
sentence,
and
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
mine
is,
other
things
being
equal,
if
we
look
only
at
the
effect
that
the
prosecutor's
discretion
to
go
after
the
person
for
the
enhanced
sentence
has,
that
effect
on
at
least
the
judge's
discretion
is
minimized
or
eliminated.
