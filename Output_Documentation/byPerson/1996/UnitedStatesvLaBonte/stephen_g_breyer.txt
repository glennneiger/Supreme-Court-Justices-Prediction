justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
authorized
by
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
know,
but
by
what
statute?
i
mean,
what
we
have
are,
we
have
statutes
that
authorize
a
maximum
of
15
years
or
30
years
for
a
second
offense,
this
intent
with...
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--controlled
substance,
and
then
we
have
statutes
that
say
if
you
do
this
near
a
school
it's
an
extra
thing,
and
then
if
you
did
it
with...
another
extra
thing...
i
mean,
like,
there...
does
it
mean
the
maximum
authorized
by
whatever
combination
of
statutes
put
together
produces
the
most
individually
tailored,
statutorily
tailored
sentence
for
this
defendant,
or
does
it
mean
authorized
by
the
statute
that
deals
with
the
substantive
crime,
or
some
combination
in
between?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words
they
have
to
have
a
whole
proliferating
schedule
within
the
guidelines
so
that
you'd
have,
for
a
person
who,
in
fact,
is
a
second
offender
of
a
cocaine
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
in
the
course
of
that
he
injures
another
person,
and
he
does
it
near
a
school,
and
you
know,
there
you
have
a
footnote
with
about
six
other
things,
and
then
there
are...
and
there
has
to
be
one
schedule
for
that
person.
and
then
you
have
to
have
another
schedule
for
somebody
who
did
exactly
the
same
thing
but
not
near
a
school,
and
then
you
have
to
have
another
schedule
for
somebody
who
did
the
exact
same
thing
but
it
didn't
involve
an
injury
or
death.
is
that
the
view--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
i
mean
i
understand
that
we
could
have
taken
it
that
way,
but
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
this
is
pretty
much
near
a
two-thirds.
it's
two-thirds,
or
75
percent--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes
but...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
an
answer
to
my
original
question,
which
i...
because
i
unfortunately
got
distracted.
is
it
your
view,
is
it
the
government's
view
that
when
a
person
commits
a
second
cocaine
offense
and
a
death
results,
and
it
occurs
within
a
thousand...
leave
the
death
out,
a
thousand
feet
of
the
highway
truck
stop
with
a
weapon,
that
the
maximum
authorized
means
the
maximum
authorized
by
the
combination
of
those
sentences,
of
all
those
statutes
together?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you'd
have
to
go
through
the...
that's
the
only
way...
and
you
think
that's
clear?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
this
individual--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
one
would
have
to
go
through
and
individualize
all
of
these--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
have
to
do
that
in
any
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
that's
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's...
i
mean,
the
ambiguity,
if
there
is
one,
i
think
is
in
the
word
authorized.
authorized
by
what?
i
don't
know
if
there
is
an
ambiguity,
but
that's
where
it
would
be,
and
the
problem
that
i
see
is
if
you...
it's
obviously
a
close
question.
i'm
not
sure
what
i
think
about
it.
but
the
authorized,
if
you
take
your
interpretation
of
it
you'll
suddenly
discover
a,
you
know,
very
bizarre
set
of
sentences,
what
i
would
think
of.
for
example,
if
you
distribute
cocaine
or
amphetamines
or
barbiturates,
or
one
ounce
of
marijuana
near
a
truck
stop,
and
you
do
that
twice,
you're
going
to
get
three
times
the
normal
sentence.
the
normal
sentence
has
already
been
doubled
because
you
did
that
twice,
so
you're
going
to
end
up
with
life
sentences
for
things
like
an
ounce
of
cocaine,
or
let's
say
an
ounce
of
marijuana
distributed
twice
in
a
truck
stop.
and
moreover,
rather
than
what
congress
suggested,
that
these
are
maxes,
so
you
could
have
a
lesser
sentence,
they
suddenly
become
mandatory
minimums.
they're
mandatory
minimums
because
nobody
would
have
any
choice,
and
are
we
really
to
attribute
that
intent
to
congress,
that
they
wanted
to
turn
all
these
things
like
truck
stop
distributions
and
so
forth
into
life
sentences?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
tell
me
the
argument
against
the
other
way.
the
argument
the
other
way
is,
what
they
meant
by
maximum
authorized
was
maximum
authorized
by
the
statute
that
describes
the
substantive
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
didn't
get...
yes,
all
right.
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
where
did
you
get...
my...
the
code
at
that
time
says
that
in
the
case
of
the
controlled
substance
in
schedule
1
or
2,
that's
the
cocaine,
the
max
that
i
have
here
is
not
more
than
15
years,
so
at
that
time
in
'84
i'd
suppose
if
you
read
it
to
apply
just
to
the...
you
call
it
the
first
offense,
the
crime
of
substance.
it
would
have
mandated
a
15-year
sentence.
now,
why
is
that
odd?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
reading...
what
i
have
is
841(b)...
841(b)(1)(a),
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
for
less
than...
that's
for
an
ounce
of
marijuana.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't...
maybe
i
shouldn't
pursue
this,
but
let
me
try
once
more.
my
understanding
of
the
structure
of
841
drugs,
then
and
now,
is
you
have
a
basic
crime
in
(a).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
(b)
has
a
whole
set
of
categories
of
punishments,
and
in
each...
and
they
have
several
subsets,
really
distinguished
one
from
the
other
by
the
seriousness
of
the
drug
and
the
amounts,
and
as
to
each
subset
you
have
it
broken
typically
into
two
parts.
one
is
a
punishment
for
a
first
offender,
and
the
second
part
is
a
punishment
for
a
subsequent
offender,
and
so
what
would
be
odd
in
congress
thinking
what
we
mean
by
this
word
authorized
is
the
part
that
is
authorized
for
a
first
offender
of
the
substantive
crime?
what
would
be
the
odd
result
you
would
be
distinguishing
if
you
took
that,
among
all
the
different
categories
of
drugs,
because
a,
b,
c
and
d
do
that,
and
you
would
have
quite
different...
you'd
have
quite
different
maximums
authorized
for
a
marijuana
person
from
a
cocaine
person,
from
a
big
guy,
from
a
little
guy,
all
for
the
first
offense,
so
what
would
be
odd
about
congress
meaning
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
other
reason
against
doing
that...
i'd
be
curious
if
you'd
comment
on
it.
the...
i
mean,
the
choice
is
really
between
saying
what
congress
meant
was
where
it
says
a
first
offender
gets
up
to
20
years,
up
to,
what
they
meant
by
this
is,
he
gets
20
years,
period,
or
what
you're
arguing.
and
one
concern
was,
if
you
take
what
you
argue,
that
really
turns
the
power
to
decide
what
the
sentence
is
directly
over
to
the
prosecutor,
because
in
most
of
these
cases
you
can't
go
beyond
20
years
unless
the
prosecutor
files
a
specific
piece
of
paper,
and
that
decision,
which
is
totally
the
prosecutor's,
is
totally
contrary
to
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
guidelines.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
putting
that
to
you
so
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's...
justice
scalia
i
think
has
put
his
finger
on
what's
really
the
difficult
underlying
question
here,
because
he
said
the
fairest
reading
of
the
statute,
and
i
suppose
what's
really
at
stake
is...
and
sometimes
you'll
be
on
one
side
of
this
and
sometimes
the
other
side.
what's
really
at
stake
is
how
much
authority
to
give
the
sentencing
commission
to
interpret
its
authorizing
legislation,
and
you
might
want
to
comment
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
could
say...
is
it
right
you
say
no
because--
--let
him
answer
justice
souter's
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
there's
really
a
disagreement
in
that
it
seems
to
me,
too,
that
it
cuts
the
heart
out
of
the
jump
from
20
to
40
years.
i
agree
with
you
that
there
remain
some
circumstances
where
it
was
important
to
raise
the
cap.
the
circumstances
where
it
was
important
are
where
you
depart,
or
where
the
crime
at
issue
is
greater
than
the
20
years
under
the
guideline,
and
where
you
want
to
use
the
career
offender
and
go
all
the
way
up
to
262
months.
you
characterize
that
as
a
big
role
for
raising
the
cap
to
play.
i
think
justice
souter
was
characterizing
it
as
a
role
for
it
to
play,
but
not
the
whole
heart
of
the
matter,
and
is
that
a
fair...
is
that
fair?
