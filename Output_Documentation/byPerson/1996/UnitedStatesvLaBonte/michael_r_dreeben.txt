mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
commentary
in
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
that
governs
sentencing
of
career
offenders.
congress
directed
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
specify
a
sentence
at
or
near
the
maximum
term
authorized
for
the
identified
categories
of
career
offenders.
in
amendment
506
to
the
guidelines,
however,
the
commission
specified
that
the
statutory
sentence
enhancements
for
recidivists
shall
not
be
used
in
calculating
the
maximum
term
authorized
under
the
career
offender
guideline.
thus,
where
a
federal
narcotics
law
specifies
that
a
first
offender
shall
receive
a
sentence
with
a
maximum
of
20
years
and
a
second
offender
shall
receive
a
sentence
subject
to
a
30-year
maximum,
the
commission
treats
the
maximum
term
authorized
as
20
years.
in
our
view,
the
commission's
disregard
of
recidivist
enhancements
conflicts
with
the
sentencing
reform
act
and
is
invalid.
the
starting
point
for
analysis
of
this
question
is
the
text
of
the
sentencing
reform
act,
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
at
page
21a,
and
it
provides
in
section
994(h)
of
title
28
that
the
commission
shall
assure
that
the
guidelines
specify
a
sentence
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
at
or
near
the
maximum
term
authorized
for
categories
of
defendants,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
specify
that
the
defendants
must
be
18
years
of
age
or
older
and
be
convicted
of
a
felony
that
was
a
crime
of
violence
or
a
specified
federal
drug
offense
and
have
two
prior
convictions
of
the
same
type.
the
text
of
this
statute
in
our
view
is
clear.
the
maximum
term
authorized
refers
to
the
maximum,
the
uppermost
limit
of
a
range,
thus,
where
there
is
a
range
consisting
of
two
possible
uppermost
limits
the
higher
of
the
two
is
the
maximum.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
maximum
term
authorized
by
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
controlled
substance.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
it
actually
means
the
maximum
term
authorized
by
statute
for
the
particular
offender.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
this
would
have
been
the
easiest
statute
in
the
commission's
repertoire
for
it
to
implement.
all
the
commission
would
have
had
to
say
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--a
sentence
at
or
near
the
maximum
is
a
sentence
within
15
or
20
percent
or
25
percent
of
the
maximum,
and
for
any
defendant
who's
covered
by
section
994(h),
when
the
sentencing
court
determines
what
his
authorized
statutory
maximum
term
is,
the
range
is
x
percent
less
than
that
up
to
the
top.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
is
not...
it
is
not
for
an
offender
like
labonte,
and
i
think
that
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
exactly
what
is
going
on
here.
labonte
is
exposed
to
a
maximum
term...
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
whatsoever...
by
statute
of
30
years,
which
is
360
months,
and
under
the
career
offender
guideline
as
it
existed
prior
to
the
time
of
amendment
506,
that
would
have
produced
a
base
offense
level
of
34,
which
is
262
months
to
327
months,
or
21
to
27
years.
that
is
72
percent
to
90
percent
of
the
30-year
maximum.
under
the
commission's
approach,
amendment
506,
an
offender
like
labonte
is
treated
as
if
his
maximum
term
is
20
when
it's
actually
30,
and
he's
assigned
a
base
offense
level
of
32,
which
produces
a
sentencing
range
of
210
months
to
262
months,
or
58
percent
to
72
percent
of
the
30-year
max,
so
i
think
that
there's
quite
a
significant
drop-off--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
term,
maximum
statutory
term
authorized
means
maximum
statutory
term
authorized--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--for
an
individual.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that
is
done,
of
course--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--any
time
a
sentencing
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
will
do
a
presentence--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
the
word
categories
does
add
a
lot
under
the
statute,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
wouldn't
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
our
view
of
the
statute
it
has
huge
operative
significance,
but
i
think
in
the
context
of
section
994(h)
it
has
plenty
of
significance
in
the
following
respect:
994(h)
identifies
basically
two
different
categories
of
defendants
that
congress
singled
out
from
among
the
welter
of
other
defendants
and
said,
sentencing
commission,
assure
that
these
offenders
receive
a
sentence
at
or
near
the
maximum:
either,
you
commit
a
crime
of
violence,
or
you
commit
one
of
the
federal
drug
offenses
that
are
identified
and
listed
in
the
statute,
and
you
have
two
prior
convictions
of
the
same
type.
so
you
have
the
category
of
violent
offenders
with
two
prior
convictions,
you
have
the
category
of
drug
offenders
with
two
prior
convictions,
and
the
structure
of
section
994(h)
supports
the
view
that
that
is
the
intended
reading
of
categories,
the
types
of
defendants
that
are
covered.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
certainly.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
yes,
i
do.
i
don't
recall
the
exact
guideline
sentence
for
the
three
respondents
in
this
case,
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
would
have
been
substantially
lower
than
the
career
offender
sentence.
the
career--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'd
be
willing
to
accept
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
right.
if
the
maximum
were
in
fact
20
years
we
might
not
have
any
quarrel
with
what
the
commission
had
done,
but
the
maximum
isn't
20
years.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
you
do.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
if
the
statute
had
only
said
substantial
sentence,
or
substantially
higher
sentence,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
i
was
trying
to
elucidate
the
meaning
of
categories,
and
i
think
that
this
will
tie
in
with
your
question,
justice
stevens.
section
994(i)
of
the
statute,
which
is
on
page
22a
of
our
appendix,
lists
another
group
of
offenders
that
the
commission
wanted...
that
the
congress
wanted
the
commission
to
treat
in
a
special
way.
in
section
994(i),
the
commission
is
directed
to
assure
that
the
following
categories
of
defendants
receive
a
substantial
term
of
imprisonment,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
list
five
categories
of
defendants
that
are
to
receive
a
substantial
term
of
imprisonment.
now,
substantial
is
certainly
a
qualitative
word
that
admits
of
a
broad
range
of
meanings,
and
the
commission
may
very
well
have
fulfilled
a
duty
to
impose
a
substantial
sentence
on
the
career
offenders
under
the
guidelines
as
it
has
written
it,
but
congress
has
singled
out
the
career
offenders
identified
in
section
994(h),
the
categories
of
career
offenders
there,
for
different
treatment.
that
treatment
is
perhaps
the
most
specific
direction
that
congress
gave
the
commission
anywhere
in
the
sentencing
guidelines.
it
was
to
assure
a
sentence
at
or
near
the
maximum,
and
it's
our
view
that
that
provision
means
exactly
what
it
says.
now,
the
implausibility
of
the
commission's
approach
of
disregarding
recidivists
in
the
enhancements
is
particularly
implausible
in
light
of
the
various
statutes
that
are
identified
in
the
career
offender
provision
as
calling
for
career
offender
treatment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
invalidate--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
not
even
so
exalted
a
status
as
rule
or
regulation.
i
think
this
court
made
clear
in
stinson
v.
united
states
that
commentary
plays
generally
the
role
of
elucidating
what
the
guidelines
mean.
they're
not
legislative
rules
in
their
own
right.
but
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
the
point
of
stinson
is
that
the
commentary
does
carry
the
force
of
law
in
this
sense.
if
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
constitution
or
a
federal
statute,
it
is
to
be
given
controlling
weight
unless
it
conflicts
with
the
plain
text
of
the
guideline
or
is
otherwise
arbitrary.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
stinson,
and
our
submission
here
is
that
this
commentary
doesn't
pass
the
stinson
test,
not
because
it's
inconsistent
with
the
sentencing
guideline
as
written.
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
overarching
authorizing
statute
that
congress
directed
the
commission
to
follow
when
it
promulgated
sentencing
guidelines,
and
because
of
its
direct
conflict
with
a
federal
statute
it
is
invalid.
the
court
strikes
it
down
and
leaves
in
place
a
totally
operative
and
valid
sentencing
guideline
that
governs
career
offenders.
at
least
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we're
not
raising
any
other
issue
about
the
career
offender
guideline
and
its
compliance
with
federal
law
but
for
this
one
precise
point.
the
commission
has
defined
maximum
to
mean
something
less
than
the
maximum.
the
commission
can't
do
that.
now,
i
would--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
that
the
only
thing
that
you
can
clearly
attribute
to
congress
is
that
it
identified
a
category
of
repeat
offenders
who
are
worse
than
other
categories
of
repeat
offenders--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
came
to
the
legislature's
mind.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
okay.
that
is
an
alternative
meaning
that
one
could
advance.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
of
appeals
advanced
something
similar.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
did
it
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
word
categories,
but
their
point
was
there
was
some
ambiguity
here
because
you
could
either
look
to
the
highest
sentencing
statute
or
you
could
just
look
at
the
category
of
offenders
who
were
covered
by
the
basic
statutory
violation.
that
doesn't
work,
i
think,
on
anybody's
theory
if
you
look
at
it
closely.
under
section
841(a),
which
is
the
basic
federal
drug
law
covered
in
the
career
offender
guideline,
there
is
one
violation.
the
violation
is
possession
of
a
controlled
substance,
any
controlled
substance,
with
intent
to
distribute.
that
is
the
statutory
violation.
section
841(b)
is
the
sentencing
provision.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
if
you
lump
together
everybody
who
violates
section
841(a)
and
say,
what
is
the
highest
sentence
that
all
of
them
could
receive
under
section
841(b),
you
end
up
with
5,
or
maybe
10
years
under
section
841(b)(1)(d),
which
covers
marijuana
offenders
who...
first
time
offenders
get
5
years,
second
time
offenders
get
10
years,
and
it
can't
possibly
be
that
congress
intended
that
these
most
serious
offenders
in
the
federal
system
would
be
subject
to
a
maximum
that
lumps
together
everybody,
no
matter
what
kind
of
drug
they
distributed,
no
matter
how
many
prior
offenses
they
had.
the
point
of
our
case
here
is
that
in
section
841(b),
as
well
as
section
952(a)
and
the
maritime
drug
law,
which
is
also
referenced
in
the
career
offender
guideline,
congress
has
tiered
the
maximum--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
actually
i
don't...
i'm
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
congress
didn't
freeze
the
maximum
terms.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
in
fact
it
revised--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
the
maximum
terms
were.
some
of
them
went
up,
some
of
them
went
down.
it
recalibrated
basically
how
the
maximum
terms
worked
in
section
841(b),
and
it's
done
that
over
time,
but
right
now,
which
is
the
operative
time
for
assessing
what
somebody
would
get
if
the
theory
of
the
statute
were
accepted
that
you
proposed,
section
841(b)(1)(d)
says
that
for
less
than
50
grams
of
marijuana
zero
to
5
years
is
the
range,
one
prior
felony,
zero
to
10.
and
remember,
the
kind
of
controlled
substance
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
and
since
all
violators
of
any
federal...
who
possess
any
kind
of
federal
controlled
substance
violate
section
841(a),
and
then
you
have
to
look
for
841(b)
for
the
sentencing
factors,
i
don't
think
it's
possibly
reasonable
to
suppose
that
congress
intended
a
category
consisting
of
all
841(a)
violators
without
regard
to
their
recidivist
enhancements,
or
without
regard
to
the
kind
of
controlled
substance
that
they
possess.
congress
very
carefully
calibrated
the
statutory
maximums
that
are
applicable
to
a
controlled
substance
offender
depending
on
the
type
of
controlled
substance,
the
harm
that
resulted,
and
the
prior
record.
now,
what
makes
it
particularly
inapposite
to
adopt
the
commission's
view
is
that
section
840...
section
994(h)
is
designed
to
target
recidivist
offenders.
the
statutes
that
are
referenced
in
section
994(h),
the
controlled
substance
sentences,
each
provide
higher
maximum
terms
for
recidivist
offenders,
and
in
the
context
of
that
specific
reference,
congress
could
not
have
meant
by
maximum
term
authorized
to
mean
the
term
for
first
offenders.
the
legislature
would
have
had
every
reason
to
expect
that
there
would
be
few,
if
any,
first
time
drug
offenders
covered
by
the
statute.
it
was
logically
possible
to
have
somebody
with
two
prior
crimes
of
violence
and
then
committing
a
federal
drug
offense
and
be
covered
by
the
statute,
but
most
of
the
offenders
who
are
covered
by
the
career
offender
guideline
and
who
have
violated
federal
drug
law
will
have
a
prior
conviction,
and
their
maximum
term
will
be
the
enhanced
maximum.
that
seems
to
us
to
be
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
would
be
odd
about
it,
justice
breyer,
is
that
this
is
a
statute
that
targets
all
people
who
are
not
first
offenders.
all
of
these
people--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--who
are
targeted
by
the
career
offender
guideline
are
recidivists.
the
drug
recidivists
may
have
no
prior
drug
crime.
they
may
have
two
prior
crimes
of
violence,
but
most
of
the
people
who
are
federal
drug
offenders
covered
by
the
career
offender
guideline
are
going
to
have
prior
offenses.
and
congress,
at
the
same
time
that
it
enacted
section
994(h),
also
deliberately
went
back
to
section
841
and
changed
the
structure
of
the
statute
not
to
include
recidivist
enhancements
for
the
first
time...
it
had
done
that...
but
it
changed
the
exact
amounts
of
those
recidivist
enhancements.
so
what
you
have
is
congress,
on
its
mind
at
the
time
it
passes
the
sentencing
reform
act,
what
are
the
maximum
terms
authorized
for
these
categories
of
drug
offenders,
let's
raise
them,
and
then
a
separate
statute
telling
the
commission
here
you
have
repeat
offenders
of
specified
federal
drug
offenders...
and
we're
going
to
list
them
in
the
statute...
sentence
these
people
distinct
from
all
others,
add
on
your
maximum
terms
authorized,
and
in
that
context
i
think
that
it
becomes
entirely
implausible
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
the
first
offender
sentence
that
is
applicable
to
someone
who
does
not
have
prior
crimes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
that
depends
in
part
on
what
one
thinks
the
purported
double
counting
objection
might
be.
the
sentencing
commission
didn't
say.
there
are
two
possible
variations.
one
is,
the
same
conviction
is
used
under
section
841(b)
to
enhance
the
maximum
term
and
to
send
somebody
into
the
career
offender
guideline.
that
form
of
alleged
double
counting,
if
it
is
double
counting,
cannot
be
eliminated
by
the
sentencing
commission.
it
must
do
that,
because
the
law
specifies
that
the
same
conviction
may
have
the
effect
of
increasing
the
maximum
term
and
making
somebody
a
career
offender.
but
the
other
possible
double
counting
objection
is
that
the
same
prior
conviction
is
used
both
to
enhance
an
offender's
offense
level
and
to
increase
his
criminal
history,
and
that
that
might
have
seemed
to
the
commission
to
be
double
counting
for
some
reason.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
what
the
commission
could
do
in
that
situation
is
simply
say,
if
you're
a
career
offender,
go
to
the
statute
books,
find
the
maximum
term
authorized,
and
sentence
within
10
percent
or
15
percent
of
that
maximum
term,
instead
using
the
grid
provided
in
the
sentencing
table
for
most
offenders.
the
commission
was
not
required
to
use
the
grid
for
everybody.
career
offenders
are
clearly
to
be
treated
differently
than
almost
everybody
else
sentenced
under
the
guidelines.
in
fact,
there's
no
other
provision
that
was
handed
to
the
sentencing
commission
to
implement
that
is
anywhere
near
as
specific
as
this
on
how
particular
identified
offenders
are
to
be
treated,
and
the
commission
could
have
quite
easily
said,
sentence
them
all
at
their
maximum.
the
commission
in
fact
had
proposals
before
it
before
the
guidelines
were
promulgated
that
said
all
career
offenders
shall
be
sentenced
at
their
maximum.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure,
justice
breyer,
that
it
is
totally
contrary
to
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
guidelines.
the
impetus
of
the
guidelines
was
to
eliminate
unwarranted
disparity
by
different
judges
who
have
different
sentencing
philosophies.
the
guidelines
do
not
and
cannot
eliminate
prosecutorial
discretion
and,
given
that
congress
has
vested
the
prosecutor
with
the
authority,
as
you
say,
to
raise
the
maximum
by
filing
a
reply
or
pretrial
notice
of
crimes,
congress
has
vested
discretion
in
the
prosecutor.
i
don't
think
the
commission
can
say
that
is
an
unwarranted
disparity.
that
is
a
product
of
prosecutorial
discretion
which
is
an
endemic
and
universal
feature
of
federal
criminal
law,
and
the
sentencing
commission
was
not
given
the
task,
which
would
probably
be
unconstitutional
anyway,
of
attempting
to
eliminate
prosecutorial
discretion
in
the
enforcement
of
federal
criminal
law,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
argument
there
that
the
disparity
is
unwarranted.
for
the
reason
that
i
expressed
earlier,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
ambiguity
in
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
said
maximum
term
authorized
to
mean
the
recidivist
term
for
career
offenders.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
the
government
waives
rebuttal.
