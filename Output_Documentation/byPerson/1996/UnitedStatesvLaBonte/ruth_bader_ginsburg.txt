mr.
dreeben,
you
had
a
point
in
your
brief
that
intrigued
me.
you
were
responding
to
the
double
counting
argument,
and
this
is
on
page
27
of
your
brief,
and
you
said,
conceivably
the
commission
could
devise
an
alternative
computation
mechanism
consistent
with
section
994(h)
yet
avoid
the
double
counting
of
prior
convictions.
what
would
the...
what
could
the
commission
have
done?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yellen,
before
we
get
to
chevron,
judge
stahl
on
the
first
circuit
said
that
he
didn't
consider
the
reading
you're
proposing
a
plausible
one.
he
said
that
he
found
it
inherently
implausible
because
it
effectively
nullifies
criminal
history
enhancements
carefully
enacted
into
statute
by
841,
and
i
think
you
have
agreed
that
it
does
do
that.
the
sentencing
commission
has
effectively
taken
away
the
effect
of
the
enhancements.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yellen,
i'm
not
sure
i
fully
grasp
your
answer,
because
i
thought
the
very
purpose
of
the
sentencing
commission's
exercise
here
was
to
treat
alike
cases
where
the
prosecutor
had
asked
for
enhancement
and
cases
where
they
hadn't
where
the
defendant's
conduct
was
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
still...
it
lets
the
judge
then
treat
alike
two
defendants
who
have
the
same
history
in
every
respect,
but
in
one
case
the
prosecutor
went
for
enhancement
and
the
other
the
prosecutor
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
said
prosecutors
have
the
discretion
to
go
after
the
enhancement,
and
mr.
yellen,
frankly
i
don't
have
a
clear
answer
to
my
question,
and
i
think
justice
souter
has
the
same
problem.
i
can
understand
you
saying,
yes,
that
judge
stahl
was
right,
it
effectively
nullifies
the
enhancement,
but
that
is
exactly
what
the
commission
was
trying
to
get
at,
because
it
wanted
two
people
who
committed
identical
conduct,
who
had
the
identical
history,
to
be
treated
alike,
and
you
can't
have
both.
you
can't
treat
two
people
who
are
exactly
alike
in
every
other
respect
the
same
unless
you...
unless
you
erase
what
the
prosecutor
has
done.
