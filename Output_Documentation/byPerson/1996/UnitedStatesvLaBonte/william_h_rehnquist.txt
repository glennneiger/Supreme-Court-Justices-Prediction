we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1726,
united
states
v.
labonte.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
yellen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how...
why
was
congress...
why
was
the
commission
in
a
position
to
second
guess
congress
on
that?
if
the
prosecutorial
discretion
comes
from
the
very
provisions
that
the
commission
is
supposed
to
be
proposing
sentences
for,
why
is
that
any
business
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
they
passed
994(h).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
because
in
addition
to
his
violation
of
841
he
had,
what,
two
prior
convictions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
were
those
for?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
congress
authorized
them
to
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
makes
the
filing
can
result
in
a
more
severe
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
yellen.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
