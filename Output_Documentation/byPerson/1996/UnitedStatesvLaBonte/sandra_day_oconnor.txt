mr.
dreeben,
the
problem
we
have
in
this
case
stems
from
a
new
commentary
adopted
by
the
commission
to
section
4b1.1
of
the
guidelines.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
precise
relief
are
you
asking
us
to
provide
if
that
commentary
is
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
are
you
asking
us
to
do,
invalidate...
invalidate
the
commentary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
treat
the
commentary
as
a
rule
or
regulation
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
ever
struck
down
a
commentary?
i
mean,

just
comes--
