justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
interrupt
with
just
a
question?
let's
talk
about
one
of
those
21
million
people
who
has
been
substantially
exposed.
and
say
that
person's
doctor
says
the
exposure
is
sufficiently
serious
that
i
think
you
ought
to
check
with
me
every
6
months
to
see
if
anything
has
developed,
because
if
it
does
develop
and
we
catch
it
early,
we'll
be
better
able
to
treat
you.
would
that
be
an
injury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
he'd
have
to
pay
his
doctor's
bill
every
6
months?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
reasoning,
would
not
that
be
a
pecuniary
injury
that
one
could
at
least
say
gave...
gave
rise
to
some
kind
of
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
more
complicated
because
there
are
21
million
people
out
there.
i
agree
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
look
at
just
the
one
is
what
i'm
trying
to
think
of.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
just...
i'm
just
challenging
the
integrity
of
the
argument
that
there's
no
injury
there,
when
a
person,
because
of
the
physical
exposure
to
that,
is
required
to
pay
a
doctor
every
6
months
for
the
next
10
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
dollar
injury
is
not
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
statute
doesn't
draw
any
distinction
between
negligence
and
willful
torts,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say,
it
doesn't
draw
a
distinction
between
negligence
and
more...
and
reckless
or
anything
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goetsch,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
has
been
running
through
my
mind
that's
been
touched
on?
and
that
is,
supposing
the
law
is...
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not...
that
if
your
client
recovers
in
this
case,
that
will
be
the
sole
recovery
for
this
exposure?
you
get
one
bite
at
the
apple.
you
can
sue
early
or
you
can
wait
till
you
really
get...
the
disease
manifests
itself.
do
you
think
all
of
your
clients
would...
would
bring
this
case?
you
can
ponder
your
answer
to
that
question.
we'll
resume
at
1
o'clock,
mr.
goetsch.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
just
to
refresh
your
recollection,
the
question
i
intended
to
leave
with
you...
we
left
in
kind
of
a
hurry...
was
that,
assuming
that
the
rule
is
that
your
client
may
only
have
one
bite
at
the
apple
as
a
result
of
the
exposure
to
asbestos
that
he's
already
had...
the
particular
individual.
would
he...
would
he
bring
the
lawsuit
in
its
present
posture?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
my
assumption
is
that
he
can
only
recover
for
one
tort
and
only
get
one
recovery.
even
if
he
has
19
different
injuries,
if
he
happens
to
sue
for
only
one
of
them,
and
this
is
the
one
he
elects
to
sue
for,
do
you
think
he'd
sue
for
this
one...
assuming
he'd
be
barred
from
bringing
a
further
action
for
other
injuries?
it's
really
the
same
injury,
it's
just
manifested
itself
with
further
harm.
environment--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
we're
interpreting
a
statute,
and
the
question,
as
i
understand
it,
has
not
been
resolved
by
this
court.
and
it
would
seem
to
me,
a
permissible
disposition
of
a
case
like
this
would
be
to
say
sure,
you
can
bring
this
suit,
but
that's
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
taking...
you
may
well,
as
counsel
for
this
particular
plaintiff,
be
taking
the
risk
that
that's
the
outcome
of
this
case.
