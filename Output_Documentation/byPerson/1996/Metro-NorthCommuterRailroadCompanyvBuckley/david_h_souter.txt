justice
david
h.
souter
but
under
general...
under
general
tort
law,
you
wouldn't
make
that
argument,
would
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
would
not...
i
mean,
but
your
argument
seems
to
be
saying
that
you...
that
there
is
no
injury
cognizable
in
tort
which
does
not
involve
personal
as
opposed
to
economic
injury.
and
that...
you're
not
arguing
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
isn't
there,
then,
an
economic
injury,
just
as
justice
stevens
says?
if
the...
if
the
doctor
says
the
exposure
is
such
that
you
would
be
crazy
not
to
have
an
examination
every
6
months,
why...
and
presumably
you
are
not
crazy,
so
that
you're
going
to
act
reasonably
and
you're
going
to
have
the
exam...
why
doesn't
the
reasonable
necessity
of
expending
the
money
for
the
examinations
every
6
months
constitute
an
economic
injury
to
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
should
we
not
accept
economic
injury?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
that's
a
different...
you're...
it
seems
to
me
you're
now
saying...
and
i'm
not
saying
it's
an
illegitimate
argument...
but
you're
making
a
different
kind
of
argument.
you're
saying
not
that
it
would
be,
in
the
abstract,
foolish
to
regard
this
as
an
economic
injury
or
economic
damage,
but
if
you
do,
you're
simply
going
to
cost
the
system
more
than
the
system
can
bear.
and,
therefore,
not
for
an
analytical
reason,
but
for
reasons
of
the
cost
of
consequences,
we
shouldn't
recognize
it.
that's
the
argument
you're
making
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
birnbaum,
do
we
know
whether
osha
covers
this--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
would
provide
the...
would...
would
osha
require
medical
exams?
justice
david
h.
souter
and,
incidentally,
were
there...
if
there
is
a
knowing...
under
osha
probably...
suppose
it
were
established
that
there
was
asbestos
that
was
known
to
the
employer
and
the
employer
deliberately
concealed
the
fact
from
the
workers
and
ordered
them
to
be
working
here,
knowingly
subjecting
them
to
very
massive
doses.
would
that
be
a
criminal
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
intentional--
justice
david
h.
souter
--intentional
conduct
was
not
alleged
here
in
any
of
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
is
a
violation
of
osha
negligence...
evidence
of
negligence?
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
that
you
are
taking
that
risk,
would
your
risk
be
different
if
you
switched
to
your
claim
for
compensation
for...
for
the
cost
of
medical
monitoring?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
be
on
a
different
footing?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
that
would...
that
would
be...
that
would
be
a
purely
economic
injury.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
but
isn't
your
theory
that
it's
an
entirely
different
tort?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that...
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
present
physical
injury
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
emotional
consequences
of
the
contact;
it's
entirely
separate,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
then
you
really
could
have
brought
two
suits;
you
could
bring
just
emotional
distress,
go
the
jury
on
that,
and
then
you
could
again
bring
a
cause
of
action
for
medical
monitoring?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
those
were
also
the
predicate
tests
for
allowing
recovery
for
emotional
distress,
were
they
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you...
are
you
telling
us
that
if
you
can't
win
on
emotional
damage,
you
can't
win
on
monitoring?
