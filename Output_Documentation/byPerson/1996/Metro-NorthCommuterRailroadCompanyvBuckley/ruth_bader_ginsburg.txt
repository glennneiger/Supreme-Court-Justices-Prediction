justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
birnbaum,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
would
clarify
your
position
in
this
case
with
the
one
that
the...
that
is
being
taken
by
the
defendants
in
the
case
this
afternoon?
that
is,
they
say
that
there
is
an
injury,
that
there
is
a
class
of
people
who
have
been
really
exposed
to
asbestos.
and
they
have
an
injury,
in
fact...
a
concrete,
particularized
injury,
in
fact...
here
and
now,
just
by
virtue
of
having
been
inundated
with
asbestos.
and
you're
saying,
as
i
take
it
you've
just
said,
they
don't
have
any
claim
until
they
suffer
an
illness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
can't
both
be
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
aren't
there
many
jurisdictions
that
have
recognized
a
claim
for
medical
monitoring,
a
common
law
claim
for
medical
monitoring,
for
people
who
have
been
massively
exposed
but
have
not
yet
manifested
any
illness?
there
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
many,
roughly,
would
you
say?
over
a
dozen
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except
for
the
12
that
you
said
go
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
birnbaum,
if
we...
if
we
just
took
the
one-on-one
case
that
justice
stevens
gave...
i
really
don't
follow
your
argument.
because
something
happened
to
this
person.
no
illness
is
manifested
yet.
but
something
happened
to
create
a
greater
vulnerability
than
the
population
at
large.
and
if
we
just
were
looking
at
these
two
people
and
say,
who
should
bear
the
cost
of
that
something
that
the
medical
profession
says
should
be
done,
we
would
certainly
put
it
on,
would
we
not,
the
person
who
caused
the
exposure
rather
than
the
person
who
suffered
the
condition
that
requires
the
monitoring?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
are
you
saying
that
we
have
a
kind
of
assumption
of
the
risk
involved,
that
the
worker
who
didn't
know
that
he
was
being
exposed
and
is
going
to
incur
this
cost
if
he
follows
his
doctor's
advice,
has
to
bear
that
cost?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
birnbaum,
you're
talking
about
fela
as
though
it
were
some
kind
of
very
restrictive
statute.
but
at
least
as
i
remember
in
ancient
days,
when
i
went
to
law
school,
it
was
the
most
forward-looking
and
the
most...
they
stretched
the
boundaries
of
everything.
causation
was
stretched
to
the
breaking
point
under
fela.
and
has
now
it
become
some
kind
of
a
constricted
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
ms.
birnbaum,
you
recognize
that
we
did.
if
you
take
wilkerson
against
mccarthy,
it's
typical
of
an
era
under
fela.
and
so
to
say
that...
you
would
have
to
be
urging,
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
1908,
that
this
court
has
a
lot
of
overruling
to
do,
with
all
those
cases
from
a
generation
ago
under
fela.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
you
conceded
negligence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
any
workers'
compensation
schemes
provide
recovery
for
any
of
the
items
of
damages
that
are
being
sought
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
certainly
precedent
going
the
other
way
that
i
am
intimately
familiar
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
latter
two,
at
least,
there's
a
considerable
precedent
for
saying
that,
if
you
recover
for
asbestosis
and
then
you
get
this
virulent
form
of
cancer,
you
haven't
split
a
claim,
you
have
indeed
two
separate
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
suppose
one
might
say
he
was
certainly
in
a
zone
of
danger.
working
in
asbestos
dust-drenched
air
is
a
zone
of
danger.
you
know
that
some
of
the
people
in
that
group
are
exposed
to
grave
danger.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that's
true
of
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
a
discrete
claim
for
medical
monitoring
apart
from
any
emotional
distress.
they
both
would
accrue
at
the
same
time
if
you
had
both,
so...
so
you
couldn't
split
those
two.
but
suppose
you're
saying
forget
about
emotional
distress,
that
is
fraught
with
too
many
problems,
we
still
have
a
medical
monitoring
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you're
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that...
that
there
is
no
such
claim
because
there
are
no
tests
that
can
detect--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
the
tests
weren't
taken.
but
there's
nothing
to
show
what
the
tests
would
have
shown
if
they
had
been
taken?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
conclude,
may
i
ask
your
reaction
to
one
point
that
was
made?
that
in
the
universe
of
asbestos
victims,
if
one
were
to
have
a
line,
one
would
certainly
put
at
the
head
of
the
line
the
people
who
get
this
virulent
form
of
cancer,
and
maybe
next
you'd
go
down
to
the
asbestosis
victims,
and
then
i
suppose
the
last
people
you
would
get
to
are
the
people
who
have...
have
had
exposure,
but
haven't
manifested
anything.
so
in...
by
pressing
these
claims,
aren't
you
putting
at
risk
people
who,
20,
30,
40
years
from
now,
will
develop
a
dread
disease?
