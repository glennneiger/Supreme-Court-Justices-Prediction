the
courts
below
relied
on
the
physical
impact
of
the
fibers
going
inside
his
lungs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
we
deal
with
a
physical
impact,
does
that
constitute
an
injury,
even
if
it's
slight?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
say
"physical".
if
you're
relying
on
section
1
of
fela,
45
u.s.
code,
section
51--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
says
a
common
carrier
by...
railroad,
while
engaging
in
commerce
shall
be
liable
in
damages
to
any
person
suffering
injury
while
he
is
employed
by
such
carrier.
now,
does
that
include
economic
injury
or
only
physical
injury?
and...
and
what
do
we
look
to
in
precedent
to
resolve
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
if
you
look
to
the
common
law,
an
economic
injury
can
be
and
has
often
been
recognized
as
the
basis
for
liability
in
tort.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
say
this
requires
physical
injury,
and
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
economic
injury.
don't
put
it
in
terms
of
damages,
because
the
statute
says
"injury".
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we
have
recognized
that
emotional
injury
will
suffice
for
recovery
if
the
person
meets
the
zone
of
danger
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
is
a
case
based
on
emotional
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
his
theory
that
if
he
has
regular
monitoring,
it
will
alleviate...
xx
monitoring...
it
will
alleviate
his
emotional
concern?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
indeed,
he
does.
because
asbestos
is
a
known
carcinogen
and
the
causer
of
serious
respiratory
harm.
and
if
one
worked
for
an
employer
who
knowingly
subjected
the
employee
for
3
years
to
massive
doses
of
asbestos,
without
ever
a
warning
that
that's
what
was
being
dealt
with,
one
would
have
some
concern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
a
normal-reacting
employee
would
be
furious.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
should
it
turn,
then,
on
the...
the
likelihood
of
the
danger
of
developing
the
injury,
if
it's
substantially
likely
that
the
injury...
that...
that
the
illness
will
occur
in
time--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
that
it
can
be
alleviated
if
there
is
early
detection,
and
that
there
was,
indeed,
significant
exposure?
i
mean
if
all
those
fall
into
place,
is
there
room
under
the
text
of
this
statute
for
medical
monitoring
recovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
claim
initially
is
for
emotional
injury
and
subsequently
a
claim
for
actual
physical
illness,
you
think
that
would
be
barred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
your
third
test?
give
us
the
third
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we've
gotten
the
two,
can
we
hear
the
third?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
in
the
work
place
and
some
of
my
employees
come
to
work
with
severe
colds.
and
we
work
closely
together.
they
cough.
and
we
ingest
some
of
the
substance
that
they're
coughing.
and
my
doctor
tells
me
yes,
it's
very
likely
that
you
will
develop
pneumonia
from
exposure
to
this
sort
of
thing.
now,
i
have
a
good
doctor,
reputable.
it's
reasonably
likely
that
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
recovery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
why
is
a
3-percent
increase
in
the
risk
a
basis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
5
percent?
that
doesn't
sound
significant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
don't
you
agree,
you
can
always
find
a
reputable
doctor
who
will
say
yes,
there
is
a
reasonable
fear
of
this
danger
in
the
future?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
that's
been
my
experience
over
30-some
years--
--or,
if
necessary,
an
unreputable
one.
