ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
this
morning
is
confronted
with
a
ruling
from
the
second
circuit
that
is
both
unprecedented,
stands
alone
and
is
contrary
to
the
common
law
and
field
of
precedent
both
before
this
court
and
in
most
of
the
common
law
courts
of
this
country.
if
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
not
reversed,
it
will
greatly
exacerbate
the
asbestos
litigation
crisis
we
have
in
the
courts
and
will
lead
to
the
unpredictable
and
expansive,
unlimited
liability
that
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
the
gottshall
case.
tort
law
is
clear:
you
have
to
sustain
an
injury
before
you
can
recover
from
a
negligent
defendant.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
what--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
the
georgene
case
on
the
standing
issue.
there
may
be
different
considerations
with
regard
to
standing.
you're
also
looking
at
this
issue
through
the
context
of
fela,
a
statute
that
provides
that
there
must
be
an
injury,
and
has
a
jurisprudence
that
goes
with
it.
but
it's
still
much
broader.
we
would
say
that
a
person
who
is
merely
exposed
and
has
no
injury...
in
this
case,
the
record
is
clear,
he
has
no
clinical
evidence
even
of
pleural
plaques,
pleural
injuries,
he
has
no
recognition,
no
determination
by
his
own
physicians
even
of
subcellular
changes--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--but,
first,
there
is
no
real
evidence
of
that
except
a
hypothetical
given
by
the
expert
below.
but
besides
that,
the
real
issue
here
is
subcellular
injury,
even
if
it
existed,
has
been
held
over
and
over
again
by
most
common
law
courts
in
this
context
not
to
be
an
injury.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
no.
i
think
that...
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
courts...
the
common
law
courts...
even
a
court
like
florida,
which
clearly
adopts
an
impact
test
by
itself,
not
a
zone
of
danger
test...
which
i
think
we
need
to
talk
about...
that
this
court
has
adopted
a
zone
of
danger
test,
not
an
impact
test...
if
you
look
at
those
courts
that
have
adopted
an
impact
test,
in
the
area
of
asbestos
exposure,
toxic
exposure,
what
the
courts
have
done
is
added
more,
because
they
are
concerned
about
this
unlimited,
unpredictable
liability.
in
florida,
where
they
have
just
the
impact
test,
the
court,
in
the
cox
case,
said
you
have
to
also
have
a
physical
injury.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
there
are...
there
are
a
few.
and
it's--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--a
little
less,
but
there
are
some.
and
if
you
look
at
most
of
those
cases,
they
are
either
in
the
area
where
there
are
a
very
small
number
of
people...
the
water
cases,
where
there
are
just
a
small
number
of
people
who
have
been
exposed
to
contaminated
water,
and
not
the
kind
of
situation
here,
where
21
million
people
have
been
substantially
exposed
to
asbestos.
twenty-one
million
people
could
come
into
the
court
today--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--no.
not
under
fela.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
that
would
be
a
damage,
but
it
wouldn't
be
an
injury.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
right.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i
think
it's
just
much
more
complicated
than
that--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--twenty-one
million--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--but
the
problem
is,
if
you
had
21
million
just
asbestos-exposed
people--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--this
would
apply
to
all
toxic
substances.
we
can't
count
the
numbers
of
other
toxic
substances--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--i
would
say
that
under
tort
law
and
under
the
law
of
fela,
you
have
to
have
an
injury.
it
has
to
either
be
a
physical
injury
or
an
emotional
distress
injury
within
the
boundaries
that
this
court
has
said.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
damage.
it's
damage.
it's
not
injury.
if
we
sustain--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
no.
there--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--it...
it
maybe
a
damage
to
you,
but
before
you
can
get
to
a
damage
for
medical
monitoring...
for
future
medical
monitoring,
the
courts...
the
common
law
courts
have
been
very
clear...
you
first
have
to
have
an
injury.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes.
and
that
is...
that
is
so.
there
is--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--because
if
you
do
that,
you
will
be
opening
up
the
courts
of
this
country
to
the...
to...
to--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--i...
that
is
the
second
argument.
i
would
go
back
to
the
first
argument,
and
except
for
the
small
number
of
cases
in
the
water
situation,
not
an
asbestos
exposure,
where
there
has
been
no
physical
injury,
the
courts
have
not
jumped
in
to
provide
a
medical
monitoring
kind
of--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--i...
i
think
that
the
tort
law
does
not...
does
not
respond
that
way,
except
for
these
special
circumstances,
these
minority
group
of
cases--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--no,
we're
not
saying
that.
i
think
it's
not
an
assumption
of
the
risk.
if
there
is
an
injury,
then
he
can
recover
all
of
the
damages
that
arise
from
that
injury,
including
foreseeable
medical
expenses
in
the
future.
but
if
we
just
have
this
type
of
damage...
and
if
you
call
it
something
else,
then
you
may
come
up
with
a
different
solution...
but
it
is
a
damage.
it
has
to
go
on
to
something.
that
something
would
be
a
physical
injury.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes,
i
think...
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
even
more
so
under
fela.
the
statute
is
explicit...
you
have
to
have
an
injury.
we're
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
it
talks
about
a
physical
injury.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i...
i
think
what
you
look
to
is
the
common
law.
what
you
look
to
is
your
prior
field
of
precedent.
what
you
look
to
is
language
and
the
intent
of
congress.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
but
this
is
not--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
i
think
that
the
kind
of
economic
damages
we're
talking
about
is
not
this
type
or
economic
damage.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i...
i...
the
statute
does
say
"injury".
and
this
court
has
interpreted
that
to
mean,
in
some
instances,
physical
injury,
emotional
distress
injury
under
certain
limitations
that
this
court
said
was
important.
and
there
is
no
case
under
fela
that
has
ever
held
that
the
type
of
damage
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
injury
that
was
covered
by
congress,
certainly
in
1908,
and
certainly
today.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes.
that
is
exactly
right.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
well,
it's
based
on
emotional
injury,
but
he
is
not
trying
to
recover
medical
monitoring
for
his
emotional
injury.
he's
trying
to
recover
medical
monitoring
based
on
his
potential
physical
injury
in
the
future.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
that
was
never
argued
below.
and
a
jury
would
be
giving
him
his
emotional
distress
injury
not
for
any
period
of
time
until
he
had
the
first
checkup.
what
he's
asking
is
for
this
injury
over
the
entire
period
of
time,
over
his
life
span
and
medical
monitoring
damages
over
his
life
span.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
no,
your
honor.
it
is
clear
that
it
would
not
have...
have
been
a...
there
had
been
no
toxic
tort
kind
of
litigation
as
we
know
it
today.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
it's
not
totally
irrelevant,
but
it
doesn't
matter--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--because
today,
also,
there
would
be
no
recovery
under
these
circumstances
in
almost
every
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
under
the
fela
jurisprudence
that
we
have.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
potter
is
interesting.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
but...
but--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--but
potter
goes
even
further,
because
it
provides
that
the
risk
in
the
future
has
to
be
more
probably
than
not.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
risk
that
the
plaintiff's
expert
says
is
1
percent
greater
than
the
background
risk.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
in
a...
in
the
limited
situation
in
potter
of...
of
four
litigants
who
were
exposed
to
contaminated
water,
potter
did
that.
and
we
would
say
that
the
california
court,
in
potter,
is
on
the
leading
edge
and
is
not
what
most
courts
in
the
united
states
have
held.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
never...
never
a
medical
monitoring
recovery
under
fela.
i
would
say
never
a
medical
monitoring
under
fela
unless
there
has
been
a
physical
injury.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
no.
i
think
it
is
a
broad
remedial
statute.
and
it
has
broadly
looked
at
defenses
and
causation.
but
i
think
this
court,
in
gottshall,
made
it
clear
that
there
have
to
be
bright
lines,
especially
in
the
area
of
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
to
prevent
the
kind
of
unpredictable
and
unlimited
liability
that
will
occur
if
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
affirmed.
look
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
person
who
has
no
injury,
who
has
no
serious
emotional
distress.
he
is
worried
and
angry.
well,
he
may
have
a
good
right
to
be
worried
and
angry.
but
he--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
i
agree,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
your
honor,
there
are
several
things
in
your
statement
that
really
i
question...
and
we'll
get
back
to
the
massive
amounts
in
a
moment...
of
asbestos...
but
dr.
selikoff,
who
is
one
of
the
noted
scientists
in
this
area,
who
brought
this
all
to
the
attention
of
the
public,
said
in
his
book,
"asbestos
and
disease",
it
is
undisputed
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
exposure-only
plaintiffs
will
never
develop
asbestos-related
injuries.
it's...
it's...
the...
the
science
is
clear.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
well,
i--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--i...
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
need
for
medical
monitoring,
that
is
something
congress
should
be
deciding.
the
legislative
branch
should
decide
that.
that's...
there
are
so
many
policy
implications,
besides
the
fact
whether
this
does
any
good,
besides
the
fact
what
the
amici
argue
or
whether
it's
necessary,
beside
the
fact
of
how
do
we
decide
what
is
massive
or
substantial,
beside
the
fact
that
we
have
no
guidelines
than
the
second
circuit.
to
open
up
and
make
the
railroads
the
insurance,
the
hmo's
for
anybody
who
has
been
exposed
to
beyond
background
level...
because
that's
what's
really
being
argued--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
because
if
there's
going
to
be
a
whole
new
remedy,
isn't
this
something
the
legislature
should
decide,
based
on
public
policy?
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i
think
we
can...
we
can
define
physical
injury,
we
can
define
emotional
injury.
this
court
did
that
in
gottshall.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
well,
i--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
first
of
all--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
i
think
it's
what,
generally,
the
law
of
the
various
states
and
federal
courts
interpreting
state
law...
i
would
say
it
would
be
at
least
what
the
majority
of
courts
would
say.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i
don't...
i
don't...
i'm
not
making
the
argument,
your
honor,
that
you
should
do
this.
i'm
arguing
just
the
opposite.
you
shouldn't
do
this--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
those
of
you
on
this
court
that
will
like
to
look
at
1908
and
decide
that
what
was
the
common
law
in
1908
should
govern.
there
are
those
of
you
who
don't
believe
that,
and
you're
going
to
look
at
the
common
law
as
it
has
developed.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
overwhelming
common
law...
all
of
the
common
law
in
1908...
and
the
overwhelming
common
law
today
would
require
a
physical
injury
before
you
permit
a
requirement
for
the
kinds
of
damages
we're
talking
about.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
it's
going
on
probably
today
in
many
work
places.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
certainly.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
it
depends
on
how
we
define
"substantial".
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i...
i
don't...
i
can't--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--i...
i
don't...
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
many
would
be.
many
would
not
be.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
well,
i
think
that
has
changed
by
statute
in...
in
many
jurisdictions
now.
but,
yes,
many
jurisdictions--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
literature
on
this--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
there
is
some...
yes,
there
is
some
literature.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
and
i
could...
i
just
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me,
but
i
could
let
the
court
know
what
it
is...
in
which
they
have
studied
the
kinds
of
cases
where
workers
have
been
provided
money
for
medical
monitoring
in
which
they
never
went
to
a
doctor
and
in
which
they
took
the
money
and
pocketed
the
money.
and
there
is
some
literature
on
that
by
discussions
and
interviews
with...
with
workers.
if
this
were--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--yes--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--osha
could
require
medical
exams.
osha
did
not
require
medical
exams
here
because...
it's
not
in
the
record...
but...
because
the
amount
of
asbestos
that
was...
that
was
found
in...
in
tests
during
the
period
that
he
was
working,
but
not
in
his
work
place,
just
didn't
show
the
proper
amount
that
the...
that
the
amount
of
asbestos
was
as
high
as
osha
would
require.
osha
has
a
provision
that
does
cover
this.
and
osha
does
cover
railroads
in
new
york.
so--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--it...
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
but
i
know,
in
that
situation,
you
might
have
an
intentional
act,
which
is
not
what
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
only
talking
about
a
negligence
act.
and
there
could
be
different
rules
there
or
different
rules
that
apply
to
intentional
acts.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
and
it
could
be--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--no.
no,
your
honor.
it's
just
plain
negligence.
no
matter
how
the
plaintiff
would
argue
it,
of
outrageous,
egregious,
this
was
a
stipulation
of
negligence.
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
was
never
argued
before
the
court.
it
was
never--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--the
fela
statute?
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes,
it's
a
negligence
statute.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
right.
it's
negligence
alone.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
negligence
is
what
fela
is
all
about.
the
defendant
is
negligent
and
the
plaintiff
is
injured.
and--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--it
would
be
evidence
of
negligence.
but
it
was
not...
this
was
not
even
before
the
court
here.
and
it
was
a
stipulation.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i
do...
i
can't...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
this
would
not
be
what
we're
talking
about
here
under
fela.
i
just
don't
know
whether
some
workers'
comps
do...
statutes
do...
and
some
don't.
but
what
is--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--we
say
he
could
not
under
the
one-judgment
rule.
this
is
not
coming
back
for
another
type
of
injury,
where
some
courts
have
permitted
that
to
happen,
where
there
has
been
an
injury
of
asbestosis,
and
then
you
come
back
when
you
can
get
cancer.
we
would
say
that
the
one-judgment
rule
would
put
him
out
of
court.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i
think
it
would.
but
if--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--yes,
if
it
would...
if
it
would
not,
think
what
you're
doing
here.
he
would
first
recover
for
his
anger,
not
severe
emotional
distress,
which
we
haven't
talked
about,
which
almost
every
court
has
required...
for
his
anger...
then,
if
he
gets
pleural
plaques
or
pleural
thickening,
he
may
come
back
again
and
say
it's
a
pleural
disease.
then,
if
he
gets
asbestosis,
he
may
come
back
again
and
say
he
has
a
different
disease,
asbestosis.
and
then,
if
he
gets
cancer
down
the
road,
he
can
come
back
again
and
say
he
has
cancer.
i
mean
this
is--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--many...
many
courts
have
held
that
way,
your
honor.
so,
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
not
only
the
one-disease
or
the
two-disease
rule,
we
have
a
totally
different
type
of
damages,
then
all
of
the
potential
of
the
personal
injury
damages.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
court...
the
second
circuit
went
off
wrong
on
two
instances.
one,
this
man
is
not...
not
a
bystander.
he
doesn't
fall
into
the
zone
of
danger
rule.
he
wasn't
in
peril
of
imminent
injury.
he
was
not...
he
was
not...
sustained
any
severe
injury.
there
is
no
physical
manifestation
of
his
injury.
there
is
no
objective
evidence
that
he
even
sustained
an
emotional
injury.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
then
every
worker
who
was
anywhere
near
a
toxic
substance
is
in
the
zone
of
danger.
and,
clearly,
that's
not
what
this
court
said
in
gottshall.
what
this
court
said
in
gottshall
is
you
have
to
be
in
imminent
danger
of
immediate
harm.
this
is
a
person
who
has
a
potential...
a
mere
potential...
of
harm
in
the
future.
it
is...
the
second
circuit's
opinion
is
unprecedented,
when
you
look
at
it
in
all
its
pieces.
there
is
not
one
case
in
the
entire
united
states...
certainly
not
in
1908
and
certainly
not
today...
that
has
stripped
the
common
law
and
fela
of
all
its
limitations,
of
all
its
restrictions
in
this
way,
and
opened
up
the
floodgates,
opened
up
the
courthouse
doors
to
any
worker
who
has
been
exposed
to
any
type
of
toxic
substance
that
is
above
background
range
and
who
is
worried
or
angry
about
what
happened
to
him.
i...
i
suspect...
and
some
of
the
amici
have
already
said
in
the
amici
briefs...
that
there
have
been
class
actions
that
have
been
brought
since
this
decision
for
non-impaired
exposed
workers
seeking
medical
monitoring
and
this
type
of
emotional
distress.
almost
every
worker
will
be
opening--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--thank
you,
your
honor.
