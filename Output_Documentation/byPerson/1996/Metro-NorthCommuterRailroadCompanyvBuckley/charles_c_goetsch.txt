mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
michael
buckley
and
the
snowmen
of
grand
central
terminal
are
here
to
ask
this
court
to
adapt
the
approach
and
the
standard
of
gottshall
to
the
problem
of
toxic
exposure
in
the
railroad
work
place,
and
thereby
fulfill
the
essential
remedial
purpose
of
the
fela,
while
also
addressing
the
legitimate
common
law
concerns
about
screening
out
trivial,
fraudulent
and
unlimited
claims.
and
here
is
the
concrete,
bright
line,
scientifically
verifiable
test
to
do
that.
first,
three
elements
of
proof.
proof
of
physical
impact
by
a
toxic
substance.
you
cannot
have
exposure
and
ingestion
without
physical
impact.
but
that's
not
enough.
second,
proof
of--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--that's
right,
your
honor.
and
this
is
precisely
why
the
test
i'm
giving
you,
the
three-part
test,
will
screen
out
such
trivial
exposure.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
exactly,
yes.
but...
but
it's
three...
it's
a
three-part
test.
first,
physical
impact,
exposure,
ingestion.
that's...
if
you
don't
have
that,
you
have
no
claim.
but
that's
not
enough.
you
have
to
show
an...
an
increase
in
risk
of
developing
a
grave
toxic
disease.
now,
if
you
don't
have
any
increase
in
the
risk,
there's
no
recovery.
but
that
also
is
not
enough.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
well--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--right.
this
is--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--that's
right.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
right.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
because
there
has
to
be
a
three-part
test
that
will
screen
out
the
trivial,
the
fraudulent
and
the
unlimited
claims.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
well,
okay,
now,
here's
the
point.
here's
the
point,
your
honor.
the
railroad
is
asking
for
a
genuineness
test,
in
effect.
they
say
you
cannot
recover
without
some
common
law
indicia
of
genuineness...
a
manifest
symptom,
psychiatric
testimony
and
so
on.
but
that's
the
genuine
test
that
this
court
rejected
in
gottshall.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
no,
your
honor,
absolutely,
not.
and
that's
the
standard
that...
that
i'm
giving
you--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--the
third
test
is--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--thank
you,
your
honor.
[laughter]
the
third
test
is
competent
expert
testimony
establishing
a
scientifically
verifiable
basis
for
a
reasonable
fear
of
a
future
toxic
disease.
now,
that
expert
testimony
has
to
be--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--we're
talking
about
fear
of
future
death...
death
by
cancer.
we're
not
talking
about
a
cold
or
the
flu,
your
honor.
that's
the
point
here.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
your
honor,
this
case
is
about
toxic
exposure
in
the
railroad
work
place.
and
we're
not
talking
about...
what
we're
talking
about
are
regulated
hazardous
substances.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
known
carcinogen.
it's
not
regulated--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--no--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--okay,
let's
take
an
example,
your
honor.
the
snowmen
of
grand
central
terminal
are
leaving
their
job
site
at
the
end
of
the
day.
they're
walking
through
the
terminal.
they're
covered
from
head
to
toe
with
a
white--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--and
that--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--okay.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
the...
the
third
element
demands
and
requires
a
scientifically
verifiable
basis
for
a
reasonable
fear
of
future
grave
toxic
disease.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
look,
this...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
an
fela
case
that
has
to
be
interpreted
in
a
remedial
and
humanitarian
fashion.
the
problem
we
have--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--okay--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well,
what
i
meant,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
the
essential
remedial
purpose
of
the
fela
is
to
promote
safe
operating
conditions
on
the
nation's
railroads
by
allowing
recovery
for...
for
harms
and
injuries
that
occur
to...
to
employees--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--okay.
justice
breyer,
if
i
recall
your
question...
which
i
may
not
at
this
point--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--okay.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
all
right.
and
my
illustration
of
the...
how
it
would
function
to
limit
that
situation,
your
honor,
is
that
a
railroad
clerk
walks
by
the
snowmen
when
they're
walking
out
of
the
tunnels.
and
later
learns
that
that
dust
on
them
that
that
clerk
breathed
was
in
fact
carcinogenic
asbestos.
that
clerk
has
a
reaction,
goes
to
a
psychiatrist,
has
severe
distress...
physically
manifests
distress...
the
psychiatrist
confirms
this
is
genuine
distress.
this
person
has
severe
emotional
distress.
no
question
about
it.
this
test
would
hold
that
that
clerk
cannot
recover,
because
there
is
no
scientifically
verifiable
basis
for
that
clerk
to
have
a
reasonable
foundation...
scientific
foundation...
to
fear
the
future
development
of
asbestos
cancer.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
because--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--it
doesn't
sound
significant,
justice
o'connor,
but
it
is
an
enormous
increase
in
risk.
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
that
is
a
10
to
50
times
greater
risk
than
what
is
considered
to
be
a
highly
significant
risk.
what
it
means--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--his
underlying
risk
of
death
from
cancer
due
to
asbestos
was
0,
your
honor.
it
has
now
been
increased
from
1
to
5
percent.
which
means
that
if
all
the
snowmen
of
grand
central
were...
share
that
1
to
5-percent
increased
risk,
it
means
that
between
two
and
eight
of
them
are
going
to
be
killed.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
but
there's
no
scientific
basis
for
them
to
fear
future
asbestos
cancer.
and
that's
my
point.
is
that
those
people
shouldn't
be
able
to
recover.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
okay.
all
we
can
rely
on,
justice
breyer,
is
objective
scientific
evidence
to...
to
confirm
the
legitimacy
of
the
fear
of
the
future.
if
there
is
no
basis...
if
there's
no
connection--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
true
in
the
field--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--all
we
have,
justice
o'connor,
is
daubert,
which
vets
expert
testimony
for
is
it
reliable,
is
it
trustworthy,
is
it
based
on
scientific
method.
i
mean
that
is
the
standard
that--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--and...
and
justice
breyer,
we're
talking
about
railroad
employees
who
are
negligently
toxically
exposed.
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
we're
not
talking
about--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--my
answer
is
that
the
only
objective
scientific
standard
that
we
can
rely
on
is
legitimate,
verifiable
scientific
bases.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--yes,
your
honor,
assuming
that
that's
the
rule
and
not
the
separate
disease
rule,
which
i
believe
justice
ginsburg
referred
to.
this
is
not
a
claim
for
present
physical
injury.
this
is
a
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
distress
claim,
which,
by
definition,
means
that
there
is
no
present
physical
injury.
so
when
there
are
physical
injuries
down
the
line,
for
asbestosis,
lung
cancer,
et
cetera,
those...
those
physical
injuries
will...
will
accrue.
but--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well,
assuming
that
that
is
the
applicable
rule,
then
he
would
have
to
make
a
choice.
and...
and
he
could
very
well
choose
to
wait.
all
right.
but
that's
not
the
rule
that
the...
that
the
common
law
is...
the--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well,
that
issue
was
not
raised
or
discussed
below
and
hasn't
been
briefed
to--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because,
again,
this
is
not
a
claim
for
a
present
physical
injury.
it's
an
emotional
distress
claim,
which,
by
definition,
does
not
include--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--i
think--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--to
the
extent
that
it
allows
the
plaintiff
to
discover,
the
accrual
of
a
physical
injury
for
lung
cancer
and
so
forth,
it
allows
the
plaintiff
to...
to
minimize
his...
his
damages
by
getting
the
early
detection
and--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--it...
the
legal
injury
for...
for
that
is
the
invasion
of
the
legally
protected
interests
in
being
free
from
having
to
undergo
those
types
of
tests
and
examinations
which
were
caused
soley
by
the
negligence
of
the
railroad.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
the
invasion
of
that
legally
protected
interest.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
i
don't
believe
so
for
this
reason,
justice
kennedy.
the
basis
for
a
medical
monitoring
claim
is
proof
of
exposure,
increased
risk
and
a
medically
verifiable
basis
for
exams
that
detect
and
treat
that
increased
risk
of
future
cancer.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
exactly.
so--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--so
that
if
you
qualify
for
a
medical
monitoring
claim,
you
also
qualify
for
the
fear
of
future
cancer
claim
by
the
previous
three
elements.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
the--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--the
damages
are
for
the
costs
of
the
tests
in
the
past
and
into
the
future.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
injury--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--that
the
injury
is
the
invasion
of
that
legally
protected
interest,
to
be
free
of
having
to
undergo
those
tests
and
bear
those
costs.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
yes--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--here's...
here's
the
distinction.
you
can
qualify
for
fear
of
future
cancer
emotional
distress,
but
not
qualify
for
medical
monitoring
damages
for
this
reason:
the
science,
the
medicine
may
say,
look,
you're
going
to...
you
have
this
reasonable
basis
to
fear
this
increased
death
from
cancer.
but
there's
no
medical
tests
or
procedures
that
can
detect
it
early
enough
or
treat
it
early
enough
to
do
any
good.
so--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--that's...
you
can
win
on
emotional
distress
for
fear
of
future
cancer
and
not
win
on
medical
monitoring,
because
the
medical
science
simply
isn't
there.
there's
nothing
they
can
do
to
detect
it
and
treat
it
beneficially.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
oh,
no.
no,
no,
no.
i'm
just
saying--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--yes.
yes.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
not
in
this
case,
no.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
medical
monitoring
costs
are
indicated
and
based
on
medical
proof.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
the
amici
brief
filed
by
mr.
simon
might
refer
to
that,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
have
that
at
my
fingertips.
but
i
do
want
to
make
the
point
that
this
universe,
as
you
call
it,
is
limited
to
railroad
workers
who
have
a
legally
protected
interest,
under
the
fela
and
osha--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--your
honor,
we
are
not
here
to
argue
for
the
federalization
of
state
common
law
via
the
fela.
the
fela...
the
common
law
is
a
smorgasbord--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
the
starting
point
is
gottshall.
gottshall
says
that
if
you
want
to
recover
for
a
negligently
inflicted
emotional
distress
under
the
fela,
you
start
with
a
zone
of
danger
test,
which
is
physical
impact
or
threat
of
physical--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--yes.
and
that's
our
starting
point
here,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
no,
your
honor,
i
strongly
disagree
with
that
for
this
reason.
the
common
law
has
everything
under
the
sun...
every
remedial,
conservative,
liberal,
conservative
case
law...
cases.
simply
because
this
court
selects
one
remedial
line
of
common
law
cases
to
assist
it
to
fulfill
the
remedial
and
humanitarian
purpose
of
the
fela--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--it
doesn't
mean
you're
endorsing
that
for
all
the--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--and
under
gottshall,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
recovered.
they
have
physical
impact.
that
is
the
test...
physical
impact
or
threat
of
physical
impact.
clearly,
they
had
physical
impact.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
only
where
there's
no
physical
impact,
your
honor.
it
was
physical...
page
2406
of
the
gottshall
decision...
physical
impact
or
the
immediate
risk
of
physical
harm.
that...
there's
two
doors.
if
you
have
physical
impact,
you
go
in
that
door.
if
you
don't
have
physical
impact,
you
have
to
go
through
the
door
which
is
threat
of
physical
impact
or
immediate
risk
of
physical
harm.
that
is
the
gottshall
test.
the
plaintiffs
here
satisfy
that
test.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
osha
applies
when
an
employee
is
exposed
over
the
permissible
exposure
limit
for
more
than
30
days
a
year.
that
is
determined
by
medical...
by
air...
by
taking
air
tests
of
the
employee
while
he's
actually
working
and
in
his
general
work
area.
the
railroad,
from
1985
to
1988,
when
they
were
exposing
the
snowmen
without
warning,
training
or
protection,
didn't
take
any
air
tests,
in
violation
of
osha.
therefore,
there's
no
osha
air
tests
over
the
permissible
exposure
limit.
therefore,
osha
doesn't
apply
to
these
plaintiffs,
and
they
are
not
getting
osha
medical
surveillance.
the
point
is
this.
the
railroad
here
saved
an
enormous
amount
of
money
by...
by
exposing
their
workers,
without
warning,
training
or
protection,
to
a
carcinogen--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--my
point
is
that
you
can't
rely
on
osha
to
deter
this
type
of
conduct
by
railroads.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
the
lack
of
evidence
means
that
the
railroad
is
not
required
to
provide
such
medical
surveillance.
but
even
if
they
were,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--that
the
plaintiffs
would
be
entitled,
under
osha,
to
osha
medical
surveillance.
but
that
does
not
cover
all
the
medical
monitoring
costs
that
have
been
established
and
recommended--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well,
the...
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
the
levels
were
massively
over
the
osha's
levels.
but
there
were
no
air
tests
taken
by
the
railroad
because
they
didn't
want
to
tell
anybody
that
it
was
asbestos
that
they
were
having
their
employees
work
on.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
not
as
far
as
the
defendants
in
this
case,
which
are
railroads,
are
concerned.
it's
a
very
narrow
class
of
plaintiffs
that
we're
addressing
here.
we're
not
addressing
general
common
law
plaintiffs
or
defendants.
we're
simply
talking
about
the...
the
fela.
and
what
the
snowmen
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
interpret
and
apply
the
fela
in
such
a
way
that
railroads
will
not
even
think
about
doing
this...
exposing
their
workers
to
a
known
carcinogen,
without
any
warning,
training
or
protection,
in
order
to
save
money...
thereby...
it's--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well,
in--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--in--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
what--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--not...
i
do
not
believe
so
in
the
case
of
the
railroads,
especially--
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
--well,
i
think
that
this
court
can
and
should
make
it
clear
that
this
is
an
fela
case
based
on
the
policies
and
concerns
of
the
fela,
which
the
common
law
does
not
share.
medical
monitoring
will
enable
these
individuals
to
detect
the
disease
early
and
hopefully
beneficially
treat
it.
so
they
don't
have
to
die
and
bring
a
wrongful
death
case
later
on.
i
mean
the
whole
point
of
this
is
to
mitigate
and
to
reduce
society's
burden
and
the
railroads'
long-term
burden
for
paying
damages
as
a
result
of
its
negligent
conduct
in
violation
of
the
fela,
in
violation
of
osha,
in
violation
of
these...
these
human
beings'
who
happen
to
be
railroad
workers'
legally
protected
duty
to
be
free
from
this
type
of
exposure
to
a
known
carcinogen.
and
if
the
railroads
are
not
held
economically
accountable
under
the
fela
for
this
type
of
conduct,
they
will
have
no
meaningful
economic
incentive
to
avoid
it
in
the
future.
indeed,
they
can
save
substantial
amounts
of
money
by
doing
this
again.
mr.
charles
c.
goetsch
in
20
to
30
to
40
years,
your
honor,
when
witnesses
are
dead
and
gone,
documents
lost
and
destroyed,
the
railroad
merged
and
bankrupt,
and
the
railroad
says
okay,
you're
dying
of
cancer,
now
prove
it.
that's
not
enough
of
a
deterrent
to
stop
what's
happening
now.
they
don't
want
to
be
subject
to
this--
