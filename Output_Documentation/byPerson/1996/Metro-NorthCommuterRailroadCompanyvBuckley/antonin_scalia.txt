justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
birnbaum,
you...
you
said
in
passing
that
this
type
of
thing
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
covered
in
1908,
when
fela
was
enacted.
is
it
your
contention
that
we
should
not
extend
the
statute
beyond
what
it
meant
in
1908?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
we
let
congress
decide
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
suggest.
but
you
say
a
whole
new
remedy,
you've
conceded
that
we
can
create
new
remedies.
i
mean
the
statute
says
"who
has
suffered
injury".
and
i
presume
that
suffering
injury
meant
something
in
1908.
but
you
say
we're
not
bound
by
that.
we
can...
we
can
define
today
things
to
be
injury
that
were
not
injury
in
1908.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know.
i
mean
why
do
you
limit
it
to
those?
once
you
acknowledge
that
we're
not
bound
to
whatever
congress
thought
it
was
doing
in
1908,
you're
letting
this
court
simply
create
a
whole
new
tort
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
just
arguing,
you
know,
you
want
us
to
develop
that...
what
do
we
base
this...
this
new
tort
law
on?
should
we
be
guided
by
the...
the...
you
say
we
should
be
guided
by
the
common
law.
what
does
the
common
law
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
meant
something
in
1908.
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means
no.
what
does
it
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
a
grave
toxic
disease?
i
mean,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
are
all
sorts
of
risks
that
we
go
through
in
life,
and
you
pay
for
them
out
of
your
own
pocket.
i
mean,
you
know,
life
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
not
a
bed
of
roses.
i'm
walking
down
the
street
in
new
york
or,
worse
yet,
i'm
standing
in
a
crowded
subway
in
new
york
and
the
person
next
to
me
coughs.
and...
and
some
of
the...
some
of
his
cough
lands
upon
me
or
in
the
ambient
air
and
i
ingest
it.
so
there
has
been
an
impact.
your...
your
test
number
one
has
been
met.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
person
is
coughing,
presumably
because
he
has
a
cold.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i'm
very
careful
about
such
things.
let's
say
i'm
elderly,
and...
and
getting
a
cold
could
be
very
harmful.
now,
is
he
liable
to
me
for...
for
medical
monitoring
thereafter?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
trivial
to
me.
i
mean
i...
i
don't
want
to
have
a
cold.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
a
cold,
it's
the
flu.
it's
not
a
cold.
it's
the
flu.
the
flu
can
be
very
serious,
very
painful.
am
i...
i
mean
every
time
somebody
causes
me
some
inconvenience,
do
i
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
doesn't
help
my
questions
at
all.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
get
coughed
on,
you're
likely
to
get
a
cold
or
flu--
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
seeking
just
the
reimbursement
for
those
medical
expenses?
or
are
you...
you
described
that
what's
at
issue
is
his
right
to
be
free
from
having
to
undergo
these
tests.
so
i
guess
you're
seeking
both
damage...
both
the
costs
of
the
tests
and
also
damages
for
having
to
undergo
them?
because
they
may
be
painful.
they're
certainly
inconvenient,
at
least.
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
the
costs,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
then,
he
should
get
damages
for
having
to
undergo
the
tests,
shouldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
the
costs
of
the
tests.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
like
saying,
you
know,
if
somebody
tortures
you,
you
don't...
you
don't
just
get
the
cost
of
the
torture
instruments,
you
presumably
get--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
so.
you're...
you're
asking
us
to
interpret
the
fela
according
to
the
common
law.
so
what
you're
trying
to
persuade
is
that,
in
general,
the
common
law
ought
to
protect
these
interests.
and
since
the
common
law,
in
general,
protects
them,
they
are
protected
under
the
fela.
you're
not
arguing
for
a
peculiar
rule
for
the
fela.
is
there
any
language
of
the
fela
that
would
make
that
the
rule,
if
it's
not
the
general
common
law
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
you're
arguing
that
this
should
be
the
fela
rule
only
because
it
is
the
general
common
law
rule.
isn't
that
your
argument?
