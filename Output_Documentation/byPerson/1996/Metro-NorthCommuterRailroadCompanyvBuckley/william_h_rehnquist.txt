we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
96-320,
metro-north
commuter
railroad
company
v.
michael
buckley.
ms.
birnbaum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
birnbaum,
in
the
case
just
preceding,
we
were
discussing
the
product
liability
law.
certainly
that
has
evolved
often
in
conscious
consideration
of
which
party
can
best
protect
against
an
injury.
i
take
it
want
you're
arguing
is
that
transactional
costs
are
a
permissible
consideration
in
deciding
what
recovery
you
can
have
under
fela?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
most
states
follow
the
collateral
source
doctrine,
that
a
plaintiff
can
recover
for
the
cost
of
a
medical
exam
from
the
defendant
liable,
even
though
the
insurance
reimburses
the
plaintiff
through
a
contract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
a
sense,
it...
it
does
define
the...
the
activating
factor
is
negligence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
birnbaum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goetsch,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how...
let's
talk
about
your
first
point
for
a
minute.
i
mean
how
about
the
person
just
walking
down
the
street
in
a
big
city?
i
mean
they're
going
to
be
able
to
show
some
ingestion
of
a
toxic
substance
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
first,
obviously,
doesn't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
about...
what
about
pneumonia?
[laughter]
i
mean
you
can
up
the
ante,
you
know,
from
a
cold
to
flu
to
pneumonia.
and
pneumonia
for
elderly...
elderly
americans,
as
we
call
ourselves...
can
be--
--can
be
very
harmful.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but...
just
a
minute.
what
does
that
mean
to
say
it
has
to
be
interpreted
in
a
remedial
and
humanitarian
fashion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
court
used
language
like
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
years
ago.
but
recently
we
have
backed
off
of
that,
to
have
a
more
neutral
approach.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
i
didn't...
i
interrupted
you
while
you
were
answering
justice
breyer's
question.
why
don't
you
return
to
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can...
how
can
you
be
so
sure
his
underlying
risk
was
0?
maybe
he
went
to
school
in
a
classroom
that
had
asbestos
in
it.
i
mean
i
don't
think
you
can
just
assume
without
proof
that
the
large
majority
of
people
in
the
country
have
a
0
risk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
argument
now
in
no.
96-320,
metro-north
commuter
railroad
company
v.
michael
buckley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
itself
was
derived
from
the
common
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
we
were
to
affirm
here,
it
seems
to
me
this
is
going
to
be
a
precedent
not
just
for
fela,
but
because
we
say
it's
based
on
the
common
law,
the
common
law
generally.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
i,
for
one,
don't
endorse
your
remedial
and
humanitarian
comment,
which
you've
repeated
several
times.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
followed
that
track
in
the
last
several
fela
decisions
it
has
handed
down.
and
i
think
gottshall
is
a
rather
neutral
application
of
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
common
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
goetsch.
the
case
is
submitted.
