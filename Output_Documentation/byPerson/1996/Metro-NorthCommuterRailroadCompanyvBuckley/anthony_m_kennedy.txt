if...
if
we
were
to
affirm
this
judgment
and
the
employee
got
the
recovery
he
seeks
and
he
then
later
develops
a
serious
disease
from
the
asbestos
exposure,
could
he
sue
again?
is
that
clear
that
he
could
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
didn't
gottshall
talk
about
immediate
threat
of
physical
impact,
or
am
i
incorrect
in
that
respect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
goetsch,
let's...
let's
assume
they
do,
at
least
as
a
threshold
matter.
let
me
ask
a
question
which,
in
a
way
perhaps,
is
somewhat
similar
to
justice...
or
gets
to
the
same
point
that
justice
breyer's
would.
we
heard
from
your
opposing
counsel
this
morning
that
when
the
exposure
reaches
some
measurable
level...
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
it
was
measured...
that
osha
would
kick
in
with
a
medical
monitoring
remedy.
i
want
you
to,
if
you
will,
comment
on
two
things.
is
it
correct
that
osha
would
not
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case?
and
if
that
is
so,
shouldn't
we
take
that
fact
into
consideration
in
deciding
how
far
we
ought
to
go
in
developing
an
fela
common
law
when
another...
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
in
another
statute,
has
said
this
degree
of
exposure
simply
does
not
merit...
merit
a
medical
monitoring
remedy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
in
any
case,
your
answer
is
that
it
is
merely
for
lack
of
administratively
acceptable
evidence
that
osha
does
not
cover
this
case
and
grant
the
remedy
that
you
want...
the
monitoring
remedy
that
you
want.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
don't...
i
want
to
hear
what
you
say,
but
was
my
statement
a
moment
ago
correct,
that
the
only
thing
that
prevents
an
osha
remedy
from
being
extended
to
your
clients
in
this
case
is
the
lack
of
a
certain
administratively
necessary
or
legally
necessary
evidence
under
the
osha
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
claim
is
that
if...
that
the
evidence
should
have
been
provided.
and
if
it
had
been
provided,
you
would
be
entitled,
under
osha,
to
the
monitoring
remedy
that
you
seek
here;
is
that
correct?
