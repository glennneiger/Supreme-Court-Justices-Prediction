justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
potter?
i
mean
aren't
there
two
or
three
cases--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--potter,
paoli,
ayers...
that
were--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--potter
sounds
like
an
effort
to
try
to
limit
the
recovery--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
allow
it
in
a
case
where
the
exposure
is
severe,
the
added
risk
is
severe,
and
there
is
good
medical
evidence
that
medical
tests
are
useful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
are
you...
are
you...
but
that's
still
an
effort
to
create
a
set
of
cases
where
the
risk
is
serious
enough,
such
that,
given
the
seriousness
of
the
risk,
the
level
of
the
exposure
and
the
medical
need
for
examinations,
you
have
a
cause
of
action
and
can
recover.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
would
you
say
never,
or
what
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
long
ago...
just...
i
mean
if,
on
the
assumption
that
you're
supposed
to
look
at
the
various
relevant
features
from
a
public
policy
point
of
view...
which
maybe
you're
not
or
maybe
we
are...
but
on
that
assumption,
how
long
ago
did
a
serious,
significant
amount
of
exposure
in
the
work
place
to
asbestos
stop?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how...
how
many
of
the
people...
it's
going
on
today,
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
how
many--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
all
right.
what
i'm
thinking...
what
i'm
wondering
is,
is
how
many
of
the
people...
the
workers
who
are
exposed,
who
need
medical
exams,
are
likely
to
be
covered
automatically
by
insurance
that
would
provide
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
way
to
find
out
something
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
many
of
them
over
65?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's
what
exactly
i'm
interested
in.
to
what
extent
are
we
actually
thinking
of
workers
who
won't
get
medical
exams
because
they
can't
pay
for
them?
and
to
what
extent
are
we
thinking
of
workers
who
will
have
medical
exams
regardless,
but
will
simply
take
this
money
as
an
extra
amount
of
money
that
they
or
their
attorneys
or
whoever
would
be
able
to
share
for
other
purposes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
where...
where
would
i
look
to
find
out
the
answer
to
that
question?
because
i
think
it...
if
it's
from
a
public
policy
point
of
view,
if
relevant,
it
would
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
you're
paying
for
a
worker's
medical
exam
in
reality
or
whether
you're
simply
adding
extra
money
to
the
worker's
pocket...
at
least
it
might
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
known
carcinogens
are
the
same.
i
could
spend
the
whole
rest
of
your
time
reading
you
a
list
of
known
carcinogens.
there
is
no
fruit
or
vegetable
that
you
can
eat
that
is
not
going
to
have
at
least
several
molecules
of
pesticide
residue.
there
is
nothing
in
this
room
that
doesn't
contain
some
elements
of
known
carcinogens.
all
right.
so
your
first
two
tests
don't
help
distinguish
your
case,
i
think,
from
tens
of
thousands
of
millions
of
cases
affecting
every
man,
woman
and
child
in
the
united
states.
so,
therefore,
the
third
part
of
your
test
must
do
it.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
know...
how?
because
i
suspect,
in
every
instance
in
which
my
50,000-substance
list
of
known
carcinogens
is
concerned,
where
in
fact
negligence
is
at
stake,
you
will
find
at
least
one
expert
who
would
come
in
and
say,
well,
negligence
is
at
stake,
why
isn't
negligence...
there
must
be
some
significant
risk.
and,
therefore,
i
take
it
that
what
your
third
test
is
going
to
do
is
allow
every...
a
claim
of
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
suffering
without
limitation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
isn't
that
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
covered
from
head
to
toe
when
you
dive
into
a
swimming
pool...
covered
with
chlorine.
somebody
could
say...
you're
covered
from
head
to
toe
when
you
sit
and
have
apples...
you
know,
thousands
of
them
around
you.
there
is...
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
toxic
substances
which,
to
some
degree
or
other,
create
small
risks
of
cancer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
what...
in
your
case,
you
talk
about
a
5-percent
increase
in
the
risk...
10-percent
increase.
you
get
100-percent
increase
of
being
hit
by
lightning
if
you
go
to
the
top
of
a
hill.
all
right?
the
amount
of
increase
is
not
significant.
what's
significant
is
the
risk.
and
even
in
your
case,
i
can't
find
out
what
the
risk
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
very
case
where
you
say,
must
be
an
example
of
such
a
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
that
an
element
of
every
claim
for
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
suffering?
how
else
could
there
be
negligence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question--
[laughter]
my
question
was
simply
how
your
limitation
is
any
limitation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
you
say
it,
your
limitation
is
no
limitation,
but
rather,
in
any
serious
negligence
case,
would
allow
recovery.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
as
for
that,
how
do
we
know
if
it's
a
lot
or
a
little?
i'll
tell
you
right
now,
your
risk
is
doubled
of
being
hit
by
lightning
if
you
walk
out
the
door.
it's
unlikely.
all
right.
do
people
worry
about
being
hit
by
lightning
because
they're
outside?
the
risk
of
lightning
is
1
in
2
million.
if
you're
on
top
of
a
hill,
it's
probably
1
in
500,000.
that's
quadrupling...
not
just
5
percent.
how
do
we
know
the
significance
of
this
5
percent
without
knowing
what
the
underlying
risks
are?
that's
something
that
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
in
the
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean
"fear"?
we
know
that...
look,
my
problem...
the
reason
i'm
going
into
this
is
to
suggest
how
complicated
and
difficult,
as
soon
as
you
start
using
words
like
"increased
risk",
anything
is
possible.
all
these
substances
have
increased
risks.
and...
and,
therefore,
what
kind
of
standard
are
you
offering
that
would
in
fact
permit
some
recovery
for
emotional
distress
without
saying
in
any
toxic
substance
case,
any
significant
toxic
substance
case,
automatically
you
get
emotional
distress
injury?
see,
you
purported
to
have
some
limitations.
and
as
i
listen
to
them,
i
didn't
see
how
they
were
going
to
limit.
that's
why
i
asked
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
is
not
fake
scientists.
the
problem
is
that
500,000
people
will
die
of
cancer
every
year.
and
of
course
exposure
is
real.
and
of
course
it's
a
great
concern.
they're
telling
the
truth.
these
substances
are
dangerous.
and
so,
are
we
supposed
to
say,
because
of
that
true
fact,
not
a
false
fact,
that
everybody
who
has
some
exposure
to
a
substance
that
significantly
increases
the
chance
that
he
or
she
will
get
cancer...
probably
the
entire
population
of
the
united
states...
are
we
to
say
that
they
are
to
have
a
cause
of
action
for
emotional
suffering
when
they
do
suffer?
of
course
they
worry
about
these
things.
i
mean
that's
the
difficult
question.
it
isn't
as
if
it's
a
fake
question.
it's
a
real
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
and
so
shall
each
person
who
is
negligently
exposed
to
a
serious
toxic
substance...
i.e.,
vast
numbers
of
people...
have
causes
of
action
for
infliction
of
emotional
suffering?
that's
the
question...
not
the
answer.
and,
therefore,
i'm
still
looking.
your
answer
could
be
yes,
they
all
should
have
it.
or
the
answer
might
be
no.
or
it
might
be
somewhere
in
between.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
you
any
idea
of
the
size
of
the
universe
that
we're
talking
about,
in
terms
of
potential
plaintiffs
who
really
would
not
have
other
sources
of
paying
for
medical
monitoring?
i'm...
just
in
case
it's
relevant.
the
ones
i
was...
so
that
they
don't
have
insurance,
they're
not
on
medicare,
they're
not
on
medicaid
and
they
actually
have
medically
indicated
need
for
medical
monitoring
tests.
have...
is
there...
there
might
be,
in
the
literature,
something
that
gives
us
a
rough
idea
of
that
universe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
i
would
imagine,
in
terms
of
the
deterrence,
a
large
number
of
people
will
get
cancer,
will
get
these
diseases
and
will
have
undoubted
enormous
liability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what...
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
i'm
worried
about
very
much
is
what
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out.
i
mean,
to
what
extent,
by
allowing
a
universal
cause
of
action
for
the
medical,
will
we...
for
the
medical
testing...
will
we
in
fact
interfere
with
the
people
who
are
undoubtedly
hurt...
that
is,
who
have
the
disease...
from
getting
recovery.
is
the
answer
to
that
zero?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
case
that
there
is
or
there
isn't
a
serious
practical
concern
that
if
people
can
recover...
often
extra,
because
they
have
the
tests
anyway...
for
all
this
testing,
that
there
will
be
significant
interference
with
recovery
by
people
who
do
have
the
disease?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
couldn't
stop
the
principle
from
spreading.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
doesn't
really
follow.
because
isn't
the
hypothesis
that
maybe
1
out
of
100
or
1
out
of
50...
that
some
of
these
people
are
going
to
get
cancer,
and
when
they
do,
they'll
have
a
tremendous
recovery?
