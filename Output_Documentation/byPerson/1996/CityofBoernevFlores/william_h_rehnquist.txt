chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-2074,
the
city
of
boerne
v.
flores.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
the
city?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
boerne.
thank
you.
ms.
hamilton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
katzenbach
v.
morgan
i
think
went
further
than
that.
i
mean,
it
said
that
even
though
lassiter
had
said
that
literacy
tests
were
okay,
now
literacy
tests
were
not
okay
in
new
york
for
puerto
ricans
because
of
what
comgress
had
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
hamilton,
in
your
brief
you
say
that
the
court
should
lay
to
rest
the
substantive
power
theory,
i.e.
the
notion
that
congress
may
expand
the
scope
of
constitutional
guarantees.
i
take
it
you
would
then
opt
for
a
very
narrow
reading
of
the
opinion
in
katzenbach.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
finish
your
answer,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hamilton.
mr.
sutton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
congress
were
to
say
that
we
think
that
the
grand
jury
provision
of...
what
is
it,
the
seventh,
the
sixth
amendment
+/?
should
be
incorporated,
although
the
court
never
has,
so
we're
going
to
require
the
states
under
the
enforcement
power
for
article
v,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
have...
require...
all
criminal
prosecutions
have
to
be
initiated
by
a
grand
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
that
section
1
doesn't
cover
the
grand
jury
provision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
looking
in
this
direction,
you
mean
looking
towards
decisions
of
this
court
which
interpret
the
provision
in
question,
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--they
cannot,
then,
come
forth
with
their
own
interpretation,
you're
saying.
they
must
depend
on
the
interpretations
from
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
finish
the
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
thank
you,
mr.
sutton.
mr.
laycock,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
some
of
the
early
cases
on
which
katzenbach
relied
are
not
to
that
effect.
the...
ex
parte
virginia
was
simply
a
case
where
congress
had
decided
that
state
officials
who
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
that's
no
extension
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
reynolds
didn't
reason
on
that
basis.
i
mean,
there
wasn't
any
compelling
interest
standard
at
the
time
of
reynolds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
compelling...
we're
interpreting
what
congress
meant
by
compelling
interest
in
the
statute--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--rather
than,
as
we
had
previously
thought,
what
we
meant
by
a
compelling
interest
under
the
constitution.
that's
quite
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
dramatically
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
if
we're
faithful
to
our
oaths
we've
got
to
say,
we're
looking
at
what
congress
meant
by
this.
we
have
the
final
word
on
what
a
statute
means,
too,
but
that's
not
nearly
the
same
thing
as
having,
as
marbury
said,
the
final
word
on
what
the
constitution
means.
there
we
cannot
be
overridden
except
by
an
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
or
be
in
the
state
of
nature,
you
might
say.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
dicta
in
katzenbach?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
understand
that
at
all,
why
congress
may
move
in
one
direction
a
constitutional
right
but
may
not
move
it
in
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
voting
rights
act,
it's
constitutionality
has
never
been
upheld
by
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
laycock.
general
dellinger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what,
mr.
dellinger?
you
gave
a
case
name,
i
believe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
many
others...
how
many
others,
other
than
miranda
are
there,
where
they...
we
have
imposed
a
prophylactic
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
a
constitutional
holding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
certainly
the
peyote
smokers
don't
have
a
great
deal
of
influence,
and
yet
they
succeeded
in
oregon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
dellinger.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-2074,
city
of
boerne
versus
flores
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
