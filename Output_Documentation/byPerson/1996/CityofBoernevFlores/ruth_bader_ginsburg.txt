[laughter]
ms.
hamilton,
the
historical
record
is
not
all
one
way
on
that
point,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
main
point,
then,
with
respect
to
that
branch
of
your
argument
that
what
congress
may
be
able
to
do
in
a
particularized
way,
focusing
on
a
discrete
problem,
it
can't
do
wholesale?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
can
separate
them,
your
marbury
argument
from
your
federalism
argument,
suppose
congress
said,
we
want
to
lead
by
example,
so
we're
going
to
have
a
wholesale
exemption
that
will
cover
all
federal
legislation,
that
will
cover
all
regulations
by
all
federal
agencies,
and
these
will
be
the
standards,
the
standards
that
are
in
rfra,
and
just
on
the
federal
level.
we're
leaving
the
states
alone.
would
there
be
any
constitutional
infirmity
in
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
congress
has
again
said
what
it
thinks
should
have
been
the
smith
doctrine,
instead
of
what
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they're
not
saying
they're
reinterpreting
the
constitution.
they're
saying,
we
know
we
can
give
exemptions,
but
we
don't
want
to
have
to
go
through
all
these
statutes.
we
may
miss
some.
so
we
just
have
this
wholesale
exemption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
laycock,
you
can
say
that,
and
i
could
understand
it
intellectually,
but
practically
isn't
it
so
that
what
this
statute
does
is
to
make
the
smith
doctrine
academic,
a
dead
letter?
it
will
never
be
applied
as
long
as
this
statute
lives.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
explain
to
me
a
case
in
which
the
notion
that
a
law
of
general
application
does
not
have
to
make
exceptions
for
religious
observances?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
that
would...
once
we
have
rfra,
where
that
doctrine
would
ever
come
into
play?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
my
understanding
was
that
this
goes
at
least
as
far
in
protecting
religious
freedom
as
smith
does,
and
then
goes
quite
a
distance
further.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
it
seems
to
me
it
covered
everything
that
the
smith
doctrine
protects,
and
protects
more
and,
indeed,
that
was
the
only
purpose
in
enacting
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dellinger,
we've
just
been
told
by
the
representative
of
the
ohio
attorney
general
that
the
states
want
to
do
even
more
than
congress
has
done,
but
they
don't
want
congress
to
tell
them.
that's
where
they
say
they
see
the
principle
constitutional
problem,
and
you've
just
said
that
the
states...
you
know,
we
can't
trust
them,
and
i'm
asking
you
what
basis
is
there
for
making
that
judgment
when
we're
being
told
by
the
states,
leave
us
alone.
we'll
do
even
better.
