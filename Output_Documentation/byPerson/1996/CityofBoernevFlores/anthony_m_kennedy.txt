justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
a
separation
of
powers
argument
in
part,
that
we
must
proceed
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
is
there
something
of
that
in
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--separation
of
powers
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
does
that
apply
to
the
validity
of
the
law
in
its
federal
aspect,
or
just
vis-a-vis
the
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
that
respect,
is
there
some
requirement
that
the
degree
of
intrusion
on
the
states
must
be
roughly
balanced
by
the
severity
of
the
problem
they're
trying
to
correct?
is
that
the
calculus
we
use?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
consistently
with
the
establishment
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
you
overprotect
you
have
an
establishment
clause
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can't
quite
see
your
eyes.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
religious
adherents
have
a
preference
under
every
regulation,
every
statute,
every
ordinance,
does
that
not
raise
free
exercise...
or
establishment
problems
that
are
very
significant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
compelling
interest
has
an
institutional,
a
juridical
meaning
based
on
our
past
cases,
and
i
assume
under
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
construction
that
that
is
what
congress
intended.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response--
--one...
if
i
can,
just
one
moment,
justice
breyer,
congress
does...
this
court
doesn't
have
independence
if
it's
construing
a
statute
which
has
imported
into
its
terms
a
term
of
art
that
had
fairly
specific
meaning,
i.e.,
compelling
interest.
it
was
watered
down
considerably,
but
that's
the
statutory
standard
we
must
follow,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
this
case--
--but
congress
enacted...
go
on.
this
case
says
that
every
law,
every
ordinance,
every
regulation
in
the
united
states
must
grant
a
religious
preference
if
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
met,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
quite
inconsistent
with
our
traditions,
and
it
has
very
serious
establishment
clause
problems--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
respect
to
zoning,
with
respect
to
the
facilities
that
churches
must
have,
the
fire
exits,
et
cetera,
and
with
respect
to
tax
exemptions
and
tax
deductions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
an
establishment
violation
is
measured
by
whether
there's
a
preference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
we
were
all
in
the
state
of
nature,
then
that
wouldn't
be
the...
wouldn't
be
a
problem,
but
only
the
churches
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
in
this
case,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
the
denial
of
the
variance
from
the
historic
site
ordinance
was,
in
fact,
a
violation
of
the
act?
you're
here
defending
the
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
that
charitable
deductions
are
very
important
for
some
churches.
could
congress,
consistently
with
this
act,
abolish
charitable
deductions
if
that
amounted...
if
that
would
result
in
some
closure
of
churches?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
act
addresses
that,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
act
says
that
congress
must
use
the
least-restrictive
means
in
formulating
its
tax
policy--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
order
to
protect
religion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
not
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
not
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'd
assumed
they
had
abolished
the
charitable
deduction
completely.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
saint
peter
catholic
church
in
boerne,
texas
was
built
in
1923
and
it
is
said
that
replicate
the
mission
style
of
that
region’s
earlier
history
that
actually
proved
to
be
a
problem
for
the
church.
the
archbishop
had
given
approval
for
a
remodeling
plan
with
cause
alterations
to
the
structure
to
increase
the
size
of
the
church.
because
of
the
niche
in
style
the
church
was
said
by
local
authorities
to
be
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
a
historic
preservation
zone,
so
the
building
permit
was
denied.
now,
the
church,
through
the
archbishop,
challenged
the
denial
in
federal
district
court.
the
complaint
contained
various
claims
but
to
this
point,
the
litigation
has
sent
it
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
of
1993.
the
act
is
abbreviated
rfra
and
then
you
supply
a
vowel
to
pronounce
it
rfra.
the
church
claims
that
because
of
the
protection
afforded
to
it
by
rfra
is
exempt
from
the
zoning
restrictions.
the
district
court
found
rfra
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed,
and
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
congress
enacted
rfra
in
direct
response
to
our
decision
in
employment
division
versus
smith.
in
smith
we
held
that
a
neutral
generally
applicable
law
consistent
with
the
free
exercise
clause
need
not
be
justified
by
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
even
if
it
is
substantially
burden
the
religious
practice.
rfra
thought
to
alter
that
rule.
rfra
requires
that
all
laws
whether
federal
or
state
must
be
justified
by
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
employ
the
least
restrictive
means
of
furthering
that
interest
whenever
it
substantially
burdens
a
religious
practice.
our
federal
government
is
one
of
the
enumerated
powers.
congress
relied
on
its
fourteenth
amendment
enforcement
power
in
enacting
the
most
far
reaching
and
substantial
of
rfra's
provisions
of
which
impose
its
requirements
from
states
and
local
government.
the
question
posed
by
this
case
is
whether
rfra
enforces
the
free
exercise
clause
as
interpreted
by
smith.
congress’
power
under
section
5
extends
only
to
enforcing
the
fourteenth
amendment.
legislation
which
deters
or
remedies
its
constitutional
violations
can
fall
within
the
suite
of
congress’
enforcement
power.
however,
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
decree
the
substance
of
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
restrictions
on
the
states.
while
the
line
between
measures
that
remedy
and
prevent
unconstitutional
actions,
and
measures
that
make
substantive
change
in
the
governing
law
is
not
easy
to
determine,
and
congress
must
have
a
wide
latitude
in
determining
where
it
lies.
the
distinction
exists
and
it
must
be
observed.
it
must
be
congruent
in
proportionality
between
the
injury
to
be
prevented
or
remedied
in
the
means
adopted
to
that
end.
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
history
and
our
case
will
confirm
the
remedial
rather
than
substantive
nature
of
the
enforcement
clause.
rfra
is
not
a
proper
exercise
of
congress’
remedial
or
preventive
power.
in
this
regard,
a
comparison
between
rfra
and
the
voting
rights
act
is
instrictive.
in
contrast
to
the
record
which
confronted
congress
and
the
judiciary
in
the
voting
rights
cases,
rfra’s
legislative
record
lacks
examples
of
modern
infrences
of
generally
applicable
laws
passed
because
of
religious
bigotry.
moreover,
rfra’s
coverage
is
sweeping.
it
applies
to
every
level
of
government
and
to
all
rules
regardless
of
subject
matter.
its
least
restrictive
means
compelling
governmental
interest
test
is
the
most
demanding
known
to
the
constitutional
law.
this
is
a
considerable
congressional
intrusion
into
the
states'
traditional
prerogative
and
general
authority
to
regulate
for
the
health
and
welfare
of
their
citizens.
the
substantial
cause
rfra
exacts
far
exceed
any
pattern
or
practice
of
unconstitutional
conduct
under
the
free
exercise
clause
of
as
interpreted
in
smith.
when
congress
acts
within
its
fair
power
and
responsibility,
it
has
not
just
the
right
but
the
duty
to
make
its
own
informed
judgment
on
the
meaning
and
force
of
the
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
court
has
interpreted
the
constitution,
it
has
acted
within
the
province
of
the
judicial
branch
which
embraces
the
duty
to
say
what
the
law
is.
when
the
political
branches
of
the
government
act
against
a
background
of
a
judicial
interpretation
of
the
constitutional
already
issued,
it
must
be
understood
that
in
later
cases
and
controversies,
the
court
will
treat
its
precedents
with
the
respect
due
them
under
settled
principles
including
stare
decisis.
contrary
expectations
must
be
disappointed.
rfra
was
designed
to
control
cases
and
controversies
such
as
the
one
before
us,
but
as
the
provisions
of
the
federal
statute
here
invoked
are
beyond
congressional
authority,
it
is
this
court’s
president
and
not
rfra
which
must
control.
