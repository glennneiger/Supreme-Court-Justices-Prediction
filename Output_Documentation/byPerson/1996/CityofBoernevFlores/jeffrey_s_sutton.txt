mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
of
all,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
first
question,
there
are
two
critical
differences
between
rfra
and
every
section
5
case
that
has
come
before
it.
first,
there
is
no
predicate
of
a
violation,
and
second,
there
is
no
attempt
to
remedy
in
any
way.
the
key
problem
with
rfra,
what
makes
it
different
from
every
piece
of
section
5
legislation
that's
ever
been
reviewed
by
this
court
or
ever
enacted,
is
that
it's
totally
global
in
nature.
it
simply
creates
a
new
standard
of
review
for
every
single
form
of
state
action
that
ever
existed
before,
or
ever
will
exist.
it
contains
no
time
limitations.
it's
simply
a
constitutional
amendment
in
section
5
clothing.
the
court
has
never
approved
that.
i
don't
think
they
should
approve
it
now.
justice
scalia,
with
respect
to
your
question
about
incorporation,
i
respectfully
disagree
about
the
notion
that
we
can
draw
the
line
with
respect
to
unincorporated
and
incorporated
rights.
it's
true
the
court
has
never
held
that
section
5
applies
to
incorporated
rights,
and
i've
worked
hard
and
long
to
figure
out
a
way
to
make
something
out
of
that.
i
simply
can't.
section
5
applies
by
its
terms
to
every
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
includes--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
as
your
incorporation
decisions
read,
section
5
in
this
instance
is
not
enforcing
the
first
amendment.
it's
enforcing
the
due
process
clause.
that's
how
they
read.
if
the
notion
had
been
justice
black's
adamson
notion,
that
you
incorporate
across
the
board,
it
might
be
different,
but
that's
not
how
they
read.
they
talk
about
liberty
interests.
one
liberty
interest
is
the
free
exercise
clause.
it
applies
across
the
board
to
states,
and
the
federal
government,
same
standard
of
review.
there's
simply
no
line
you
can
draw.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
section
5
would
not
allow
you
to
enforce
that
because
it
doesn't
appear
in
section
1.
section
1
does
cover
the
free
exercise
clause.
but
this--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
that's
a
fair
point.
i
suppose,
as
a--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--to
understate
the
matter.
[laughter]
it's
true
as
a
predictive
matter
i
think
congress...
you're
probably
right
that
congress
could
say
it
does
incorporate,
it
could
pass
legislation
saying
the
states
have
to
comply
with
the
grand
jury
provision,
but
when
that
piece
of
legislation
came
here,
the
question
of
a
violation
is
up
to
you.
it's
not
up
to
congress.
as
to
violations,
there
is
no
deference.
as
to
remedy...
and
justice
souter,
i
want
to
get
to
your
point...
there
is
substantial
deference.
now,
the
question
of
the
factual
record
is
a
difficult
one,
and
it's
very
problematic
for
my
side.
i
understand
that.
i
think
the
starting
point
is
the
court's
decision
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach.
what
did
they
do
when
they
first
started
allowing
prophylactic
legislation
under
section
5?
first,
they
looked
at
the
record.
they
looked
at
what
congress
had
done,
what
it
had
found.
there
were
commissions.
there
were
studies.
secondly,
they
looked
at
a
series
of
case
findings
from
this
court,
from
lower
courts,
establishing
a
pervasive
and
systematic
disenfranchisement
of
the
minority
vote.
thirdly,
they
looked
at
commentary.
as
in
lopez,
that
is
all
helpful.
if
congress
does
it,
it's
smart,
because
i
think
what
it
does
is,
it
makes
it
easier
for
you
to
uphold
what
they've
done,
but
again,
as
in
lopez,
it's
not
indispensable.
if
they
want
to
take
their
chances,
be
completely
silent
as
to
why
they're
doing
something,
they
can
take
a
risk,
and
it
then
becomes
your
job,
regrettably,
to
figure
out
whether
there
are
underlying
violations.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
justice
kennedy,
that
is
precisely
it.
as
you
said
and
justice
o'connor
said
in
lopez,
there
is
an
etiquette
of
federalism,
and
one
of
the
principle
etiquettes
of
federalism
is
that
the
states,
and
state
employees
like
me,
are
presumed
to
know
what
the
constitution
means
and
to
be
able
to
follow
it.
the
only
reason
you
can
turn
that
presumption
on
its
head
and
create
an
effects
test
as
you
suggested,
justice
breyer,
is
if
we've
proved
we
don't
know
what
the
constitution
means.
congress
can
bench
us.
if
we
don't
know
how
to
follow
the
constitution,
if
we've
made
mistakes
in
the
past
with
respect
to
a
certain
provision,
that's
fine.
congress
has
significant
prophylactic
remedial
power
to
come
in
and
remedy
the
violation,
but
you
can't
have
a
remedy
without
a
wrong.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
first
of
all
the
unanimity
behind
rfra
strikes
me
as
a
wonderful
opportunity
from
a
federalist
perspective.
if
you
agree
with
our
argument,
i
suggest
there
will
be
51
rfra's
when
all
is
said
and
done.
the
states
aren't
going
to
stand
idle.
my
boss
is
not
going
to
stand
idle
after
the
argument
i'm
making
today,
if
it
prevails,
i
can
promise
you
that.
the
states
are...
they're
doing
a
great
job
when
it
comes
to
free
exercise
clause
issues,
so
first
or
all,
i
don't
think
there's
a...
i
don't
think
there
should
be
a
concern
about
underprotection.
as
to
the
institutional
issue,
i
tell
you,
i've
been
thinking
long
and
hard
about
this.
i
can't
see
a
bright
line
out
there.
there
wasn't
one
in
lopez.
all
you
had
was,
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce.
the
only
bright
line
i
can
offer--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
do.
i
do
for...
but...
well,
actually,
there
is
one
bright
line.
the
one
bright
line
which
clearly
has
not
been
crossed
here
is
a
record
of
violations.
they
can't
show
them.
all
the
record
shows...
i
mean,
when
they
wrote
this
statute,
they
were
looking
in
this
direction.
they
didn't
like
smith.
they
thought
there
would
be
problems
with
smith.
but
their
big
concern
about
the
states
was
not
that
they'd
violate
smith.
they
were
concerned
we
would
respect
smith,
and
that
alone,
and
wouldn't
do
anything
more.
when
they
enact
section
5
legislation,
they've
got
to
be
looking
in
this
direction,
and
you've
got
to
look
this
direction.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
once
they
establish
what
the
right
interpretation
of
the
provision
is,
they've
got
to
establish
that
the
states
were
violating--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that
has
to
be
correct,
your
honor.
if
it's
not
correct,
two
things
happen.
first
of
all,
congress
has
permission
to
effectively
overrule
marbury
v.
madison,
interpret
the
constitution
as
it
wishes,
and
make
that
interpretation
binding
on
this
court
and
throughout
the
country.
secondly,
it
transforms
the
federal
government,
and
specifically
congress,
from
one
of
limited
to
one
of
totally
unlimited
powers.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
excuse
me.
i
didn't
speak
as
precisely
as
i
should
have.
clearly
the
court
still
would
have
to
review,
i
think,
the
question
as
to
what
smith
means.
i
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
federal
power
they
can
reinterpret
the
constitution
with
respect
to
what
it
means
as
to
federal
agencies,
so
i--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--you're
right,
i
should
have
stopped
the
first
time.
you're
absolutely
correct.
[laughter]
and
the
reason
you're
absolutely
correct
is
they
don't
need
to
rely
on
the
free
exercise
clause.
who
cares
what
the
free
exercise
clause
means?
congress
has
authority
to
regulate
federal
employees,
federal
agencies,
and
if
they
want
to
create
exemptions,
they
can.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
consistent
with
the
establishment
clause.
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
the
first
answer
to
that
question
is,
it's
a
good
reason
to
respect
the
jeffersonian
vision
for
this
country.
let
the
states
be
the
principal
bulwark
when
it
comes
to
protecting
civil
liberties.
i
think
that's
an
important
starting
point.
the
second
question's
answer
is,
clearly
as
a
predictive
matter
they
can
take
their
chances.
they
can
take
the
view
that
here's
what
the
free
exercise
clause
means
when
it
gets
to
this
court.
if
they're
right,
the
legislation's
sustained.
if
they're
wrong,
the
legislation
falls.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
once
it
gets
to
the
court,
the
day
it's
here
at
the
court
to
be
reviewed,
if
it's
inconsistent
with
what
the
free
exercise
clause...
it's
struck.
it
doesn't
sit
on
the
books
waiting
for
a
new
interpretation
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
i
don't
think
i
know
of
any
precedent
that
allows
statutes
to
languish
and
effectively--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not,
and
the
reason
is
that
there
are
no
underlying
violations
that
would
sustain
such
a
remedial
power.
if
there
were,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
congress
to
come
in,
pass
a
statute,
and
say,
an
effects
test
is
sufficient.
if
you
don't
require
an
underlying
violation,
you're
presuming
state
employees
are
going
to
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
we
are
not,
and
personally
i
hope
you
reject
it,
because
that's
our
mission.
we
want
to
be
able
to
overprotect
free
exercise
rights.
ohio,
and
i
think
most
states,
would
say
they're
not
in
the
business
of
beating
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
certainly
hope
not.
i
hope
we've
got
a
lot
of
room
to
overprotect
religious
liberties.
it's
something
we
think
is
important.
it's
something
we
want
to
do.
we
obviously
don't
want
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
it
violates
the
establishment
clause,
though.
your
visual
cues
aren't
good.
the...
i--
[laughter]
let
me
try
to
restate
that.
i'm
not
sure
i
stated
it
very
well.
the...
i...
my
view
of
the
establishment
clause
is
that
clearly
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--my
view
of
the
establishment
clause
is
that
states
are
entitled
to
overprotect
free
exercise.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
exactly
what
smith
says.
we
will
leave
this
to
the
states
and
localities
to
overprotect.
but
i
agree
with
you,
there
is
a
line.
there
is
a
ceiling,
and
we
can't
go
over
it.
we
can't
so
overprotect
that
in
a
way
we're
establishing
a
religion
which
violates--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
would
submit
rfra
in
that
respect
is
no
different
from
the
free
exercise
clause
itself.
the
free
exercise
clause
does
no
more
than
just
protect
religion.
it
has
no
other
purpose.
rfra
does
exactly
the
same
thing,
but
just
goes
a
little
further.
that's
fine.
it's
good
as
long
as
you
don't
go
too
far
and
establish
a
religion.
now,
it
may
be
that
my
view
of
overprotecting
is
going
to
push
us
into
the
establishment
clause,
and
at
that
point
i'm
in
crouble,
but
until
then,
i
think
it's
appropriate
and
quite
legitimate
for
states
to
overprotect
free
exercise
rights.
that's
why
we
support
the
policy
behind
rfra.
that's
why
we'll
enact
it
at
the
state
level
if
it's
invalidated.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
as
many
of
the
dissenters
indicated
in
smith,
as
the
congressmen
and
congresswomen
indicated
in
pass...
may
i
finish
the
question?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
as
they
indicated
in
passing--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--in
passing
rfra,
smith
allows
generally
applicable
neutral
laws
to
pass
free
exercise
scrutiny.
they
may
be
instances
where
exemptions
are
appropriate,
even
though
it
happens
to
be
a
generally
applicable
law,
and
i
think
a
state's
entitled
to--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--yes.
