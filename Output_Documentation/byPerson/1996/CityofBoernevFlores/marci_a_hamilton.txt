ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
boerne.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
about
religious
liberty.
this
case
is
about
federal
power.
it
is
about
the
ability
of
the
united
states
constitution
to
restrain
congress,
the
branch
most
likely
to
be
controlled
by
interest
groups
and
by
opinion
polls,
from
engaging
in
a
hostile
takeover
of
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act,
which
was
passed
in
an
emotional
and
heated
response
to
this
court's
determination
in
employment
division
v.
smith,
is
a
brazen
attempt
to
reinterpret
the
free
exercise
clause
and
to
impose
that
reinterpretation
on
the
courts,
on
the
states,
and
to
shift
the
balance
of
power
between
church
and
state
dramatically
in
favor
of
the
churches.
this
is
the
worst
of
legislative
overreaching,
which
violates
the
fundamental
structural
constitutional
guarantees,
the
separation
of
powers,
federalism,
and
separation
between
church
and
state.
the
constitutional
bedrock
was
laid
long
ago
in
marbury
v.
madison,
where
this
court
rejected
explicitly
the
notion
that
the
legislature
may
alter
the
constitution
by
an
ordinary
act.
the
constitution,
this
court
said,
is
either
superior,
paramount
law,
unchangeable
by
ordinary
means,
or
it
is
on
a
level
with
ordinary
legislation,
like
other
acts,
and
is
alterable--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
yes.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
test
to
understand
whether
or
not
section
5
has
been
appropriately
used
by
congress
is
the
text
of
the
amendment
itself.
it
states,
the
congress
shall
have
power
to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislation
the
provisions
of
this
article.
enforce
means,
to
compel
obedience
to.
the
provisions
of
this
article
means,
constitutional
guarantees.
every
case
in
which
this
court
has
upheld
prophylactic
measures
fits
that
formulation.
it
has
been
the
enforcement,
the
compelling
of
obedience
to
constitutional
guarantees.
the
religious--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
lassiter
stated
that
as
a
facial
matter
a
particular
literacy
test
was
not
unconstitutional.
the
congress
went
back
and
made
a
factual
determination
that
as
they
looked
out
over
literacy
tests
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
almost
always
evidence
of
invidious
discrimination,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
factual
determination
the
court
in
katzenbach
v.
morgan
upheld
congress'
decision
to
ban
literacy
tests.
it
is
the
difference
between
the
fact-finding
capacities
of
the
legislature
and
this
court's
ability
to
be
the
final
arbiter
of
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
well,
justice
o'connor,
the
difference
between
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
and
all
of
this
court's
section
5
jurisprudence
will
turn
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
appropriate
legislation,
which
section
5
says.
there
must
be
some
kind
of
proportional
fit
between
the
means
and
the
end
to
be
appropriate.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
because
congress
in
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
was
not
aiming
to
ensure
constitutional
guarantees
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
the
purpose,
patent
on
its
face
and
ripe
in
the
legislative
history,
was
to
bring
into
high
level
of
scrutiny
that
conduct
which
was
constitutionally
appropriate.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
not
the
candor,
justice
souter,
but
rather
the
patent
purpose--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--that
still
would
not
pass
this
court's
section
5
jurisprudence.
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
this
court
made
clear
there
must
be
some
colorable
evidence
of
some
state
wrongdoing
that
justifies
prophylactic
activity.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
that
effect.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
well,
presumably--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--well,
presumably,
if
congress
did
find
specific
instances...
for
example,
there
was
a
set
of
laws
that
almost
always
meant
there
was
discrimination
against
a
particular
religion...
in
that
particular
circumstance,
congress
would
be
acting
the
way
they
were
acting
under
the
voting
rights
act
cases.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
well,
in
addition,
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
gotten
a
factual
record
with
respect
to
every
law
in
the
united
states,
whether
passed--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--yes,
justice--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--if
congress--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--if
congress
had
evidence
that
there
were
instances
where
there
was
discrimination
in
a
particular
arena
with
respect
to
particular
types
of
religions,
congress
certainly
could
go
ahead
and
do
what
you're
describing,
which
is--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--i
think
that's
possible.
it's...
that's
certainly
not
rfra.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
that
is
not
what
was
done
here.
the
point
here
was
to
eviscerate
any
proof
of
discrimination
of
any
kind.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
yes.
i...
katzenbach
actually
had
two
implicit
readings.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
i
would
hold
it
to
the
much
narrower
holding
of
the
fact-finding
capacity
of
congress.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
it's
not
at
all
clear
in
the
legislative
history.
we
do
know
that
the
first
amendment's
only
included
at
this
point
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
judicial
incorporation.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
right.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
right.
there's
no--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--oh,
we
do
make
that
in
a
footnote
in
the
opening
brief.
there
are
so
many
things
to
say--
[laughter]
--about
rfra
that
it's
hard
to
find
which
one
is
the
most
appropriate.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
it's
staggering.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
no.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i'm
sorry
to
say,
is
that
john
bingham
did
say
several
things
that
contradicted
himself
several
times,
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
if
you
look
at
the
discussions
of
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
regarding
religion,
the
concerns
about
religion
were
not
religious
liberty
per
se,
they
were
concerns
about
discrimination
against
particular
groups
on
the
basis
of
religion,
so
the
notion
that
religious
liberty
per
se
is
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
now
there's
broad
expansive
power
to
enforce,
that's
certainly
not
in
the
legis--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--in
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
well--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
point
that
justice
scalia
was
leading
me
to
with
the...
and
i
was
able
to
get
in
staggering
was
that
the
question
of
the
definition
of
appropriate,
how
far
can
congress
go
to
enforce
constitutional
guarantees,
and
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
what
does
prophylactic
mean
if,
in
fact,
they
have
a
prophylactic
power?
it
would
seem
like
they
should
have
the
most
expansive
power
that
they
could
have
under
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
respect
to
racial
discrimination.
the
history
supports
that.
then
the
question
is,
well,
how
far
does
that
prophylactic
power
go
in
other
areas
of
section
1,
and
our
argument
is
that
it
certainly
can't
go
to
the
point
where
congress
gets
to
redefine
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
rather
than
attempting
to
enforce
it
in
some
way.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
the
only
case
that
would
indicate
that
it
was
extended
at
all
would
be
hutto
v.
finney,
and
there's
no
prophylactic
power
question
in
that
case.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
i
think
that's
right.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
i
think
mcculloch
v.
maryland
applies
in
both
instances.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
well,
the
city
certainly
does
not
challenge
incorporation
per
se.
we're
certainly
not
saying--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--i
think
the
argument
is
that
katzenbach
v.
morgan
was
applied
to
equality
rights,
and
if
there's
going
to
be
a
broad
reading
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
enforcement,
it
would
have
to
be
with
equality
rights,
and
if
that's
right,
katzenbach
must
be
the
upper
limit.
if
katzenbach
is
the
upper
limit,
the
religious
freedom
restoration--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--your
honor,
the
city's
argument
does
not
center
on
extinction.
even
taking
the
broadest
power
that
the
congress
has
been
permitted
with
respect
to
equality
rights,
congress
has
not
been
permitted,
indeed
hasn't
tried
what
it
has
done
with
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act,
which
is
to
completely
redefine
the
meaning
of
an
entire
clause
of
the
constitution.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
that
is
exactly
our
argument,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
i
think--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--i...
justice
kennedy,
there...
the
separation
of
powers
argument
is
that
the
one
thing
that
congress
cannot
do
is
to
enact
a
standard
that
will
apply
across
every
law
in
the
country
and
will,
in
fact,
mimic
the
constitution
in
its
scope.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
the
separation
of
powers
argument
would
in
fact
invalidate
this
law
as
applied
to
both
state
and
federal
law.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
justice
souter,
i'm
confused
about
when
congress
has
been
able
to
do
that
generally.
are
you
thinking
about
cases
like--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--your
honor,
we're
not
arguing
for
a
high
level
on
congress.
we're
really
not
arguing
for
much
more
than
this
court
stated--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--well,
justice
souter,
that
seems
to
me
the
only
way
to
prevent
massive
usurpation
of
state
law
that
rfra
effects.
unless
congress
has
a
reason--
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
--well,
your
honor,
the
most
appropriate
case
would
be
heart
of
atlanta
motel,
in
which
congress
did
provide
for
rights
against
discrimination
in
the
commerce
clause
context
when
it
was
acting
appropriately
according
to
that
enumerated
power.
there
were
massive
fact-findings
in
that
case
as
to
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
the
difference
is
the
language
of
section
5,
which
limits
enforcement
to
the
enforcement
of
constitutional
guarantees.
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
your
honor,
gives
congress
the
ability...
may
i
finish
my
answer?
ms.
marci
a.
hamilton
gives
congress
the
ability
to
make
effective
its
enumerated
powers,
but
it
does
not
say
that
congress
can
do
what
it
did
in
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act.
