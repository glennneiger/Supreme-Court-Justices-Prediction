mr.
douglas
laycock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
controlled
by
an
unbroken
tradition
of
congressional
practice
and
judicial
decision
that
begins
with
the
civil
war
amendments
themselves.
from
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
to
rfra
in
1993,
congress
has
always
understood
that
it
has
power
to
make
constitutional
rights
effective
in
practice
and
to
go
beyond
the
floor
set
by
this
court.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
agree
the
holding
in
ex
parte
virginia
did
not
present
the
question
we
have
presented
here,
but
the
standard
the
court
announced
in
ex
parte
virginia
was
that
the
congressional
power
reaches
whatever
is
adapted
to
carry
out
the
objects
the
amendments
have
in
view,
and
by
the
next
case
4
years
later,
the
civil
rights
cases
adopted
the
badges
and
incidents
theory
of
the
enforcement
power
under
the
thirteenth
amendment,
which
plainly
goes
vastly
further
than
anything
this
court
would
ever
consider
doing
under
the
thirteenth
amendment.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that
is
not
contested.
mr.
douglas
laycock
everyone
agrees
with
that.
mr.
douglas
laycock
congress
cannot
overrule
the
court.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
effect
is
to--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--the
effect
is
to
achieve
a
different
result
in
some
cases
than
smith
would
achieve--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--pardon?
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
it
would
be...
overturn
is
shorthand.
mr.
douglas
laycock
pardon?
mr.
douglas
laycock
yes.
overturn
is
shorthand,
but
yes,
to
achieve
a
different
result
on
similar
facts
under
the
statute
than
we
would
achieve
under
the
constitution
itself,
that's
correct,
but
that's
no
different
from
the
voting
rights
act
or
from
title
vii.
mr.
douglas
laycock
do
i
think
it
overturns
reynolds?
mr.
douglas
laycock
no,
i
don't
think
it
overturns
reynolds,
but
the...
that's
a
compelling
interest
question.
that's
a
question
whether
protecting
women
is...
and
the
other
harms
of
polygamous
marriage
would
be
a
compelling
interest.
mr.
douglas
laycock
you
would
write
a
different
opinion
than
you
wrote
in
reynolds,
but
it's
not
at
all
clear
the
result
would
be
any
different
than
in
reynolds,
but
that
would
be
up
to
this
court.
this
court
retains
the
final
decisionmaking
power
on
all
the
cases
brought
under
the
statute
or
brought
under
the--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--we
all
know
that
prisoners
file
frivolous
claims.
we
all
know
they
lose
those
claims--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
requires
a
claim,
but
the
one
piece
of
data
on
that
is
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
texas,
which
reports
that
of
all
the
cases
pending
against
the
state
and
its
agencies,
less
than
one-quarter
of
1
percent
are
rfra
claims.
most
of
those
are
joined
with
other
claims
that
would
have
been
filed
anyway,
and
many
of
them
are
frivolous
prisoner
claims
that
would--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
it
would
require
the
court
to
apply
a
different
standard
under
the
statute,
but
the
district
judges--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--goldman
was
overruled
by
a
particular
statute
shortly
after
it
was
decided.
mr.
douglas
laycock
rfra...
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
compelling
interest
in--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--if
that's
how
you
read
goldman,
it
is
not
overruled.
i
always
read
goldman
as
the
military
exception
in
refusing
to
apply
the
compelling
interest
test,
but
if
there's
a
compelling
interest,
then
goldman
is
not
changed.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
laycock
you
might
reconsider
that
holding
if
it
ever
comes
up.
[laughter]
but
yes,
you
still
have
a
lot
of
running
room,
and
this
court
interprets
rfra
and
retains
its
independence
as
it
interprets
rfra.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
the
statutory
standard
you
must
follow,
but
you
have
the
same
independence
in
interpreting
that
statute
that
you
have
in
interpreting
any
other
statute,
which
isn't
to
say
unconstrained
freedom.
of
course
the
court
has
precedents
that
it
follows,
canons
of
interpretation
it
follows.
it
tries
to
achieve
congressional
intent.
but
none
of
that
is
a
threat
to
the
independent
judiciary--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it's
a
different
task,
but
it's
no
less
judicially
independent.
you
still
get
the
final
word
on
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
don't
think
we
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that...
i
think
we
may
be
talking
about
two
different
senses
of
independent.
mr.
douglas
laycock
congress
attempted
to
apply
the
compelling
interest
test
across
the
board,
but
congress
is
also
quite
clear
that
what
is
a
compelling
interest
depends
upon
context.
it's
easier
to
show
a
compelling
interest
in
a
prison
or
in
the
military
than
in--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--i
share
that
assumption.
that's
just
further
evidence
of
why
this
is
not
such
a
dramatic
power
grab.
the
power
of
interpreting
compelling
interests
remains
in
this
court.
mr.
douglas
laycock
in
theory
the
baby
can
be
split,
but
there's
no
basis
in
section
5
to
make
that
split.
what...
the
compelling
interest
test
comes
out
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
all
congress
did
was
change
the
threshold
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
to
shift
the
burden.
this
is
a
burden-shifting
statute
like
the
other
intention
and
effect
statutes.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it
will
occasionally
be
applied.
we
have
a
free
exercise
claim
pending
in
the
court
below.
keeler
v.
maryland
was
just
won
on
a
free
exercise
claim
in
the
district
of
maryland.
rader
v.
johnson
was
just
won
on
a
free
exercise
claim,
because
there
are
sometimes
advantages
to
the
litigant
in
proceeding
under
the
free
exercise
claim
under
smith,
rather
than
under
rfra.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
it--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
is
always
in
the
litigant's
interest
to
show
that
the
law
is
not
of
general
applicability,
that
in
fact
it
discriminates,
because
that
undermines
the
government's
compelling
interest
argument,
undermines
the
government's
credibility.
there
are
a
number
of
lower
court
cases
that
say
there's
not
a
substantial
burden
here,
so
rfra
doesn't
apply,
but
there's
discrimination
so
smith
does
apply.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
thought
i
was.
i
thought
she
said
why
would
there
ever
be
again
a
free
exercise
claim.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it
goes
some
distance
further.
there
are
also...
there
are
also
ways
in
which
it
goes
not
quite
as
far,
according
to
some
of
the
lower
courts.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that
was
the
purpose
in
enacting
it.
mr.
douglas
laycock
take...
rader
v.
johnson
and
keeler
v.
mayor
of
cumberland
are
in
the
government's
brief,
and
they
are
really
cases
that
proceeded
under
smith
and
not
under
rfra.
there
are
reasons
to
do
it.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
address
the
claim
that
both
ohio
and
boerne
make
that
this
is
somehow
different
from
all
previous
statutes
because
in
all
other
section
5
statutes
there
was
this
massive
record
of
widespread
violations
and
here
there
are
hardly
any
violations,
and
both
halves
of
that
are
simply
not
true.
in
many
of
the
section
5
cases
it
is
hard
to
imagine
ever
proving
a
constitutional
violation.
when
congress
enacted
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
it
didn't
discover
that
most
pregnancy
rules
were
motivated
by
an
attempt
to
get
women
or
exclude
them.
sometimes
that
is
true.
occasionally
there
would
be
a
pregnancy
case
that
would
satisfy
this
court's
constitutional
standard,
but
basically
congress
said,
rules
about
pregnancy
burden
women,
and
that
burden's
severe
enough,
it's
closely
enough
connected
to
a
constitutional
violation,
we
think
it
ought
to
be
protected.
they
didn't
find
a
fact
that
would
have
persuaded
this
court
that
there's
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
disagree.
mr.
douglas
laycock
this
does
not
require
a
massive
preference.
what
this
requires
is
that
when
government
substantially
burdens
religion,
it
has
to
justify
it.
it's
not
triggered
without
showing
a
substantial
burden,
and
removing
the
substantial
burden
doesn't
make
the
church
any
better
off
than
it
was
before
it
encountered
the
government--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
laycock
and
when
you
make
that
exception,
the
church
is
no
better
off
than
it
was
before
government
started
imposing
the
burden
in
the
first
place.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--but
this
is...
but
not
nearly
as
well
off
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
getting
money
from
the
government.
mr.
douglas
laycock
this
court--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--the
court
unanimously
rejected
that
understanding
in
amos.
simply
relieving
a
burden
or
exempting
the
church
is
not
an
establishment,
nine-zero.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
the
question...
you
could
pass
that
law,
and
this
court
would
then
have
to
decide
whether
it
violated
the
free
exercise
clause,
but...
and
this
court
would--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--after
swaggert,
i
suppose
not.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
laycock
no.
my
client
obviously
has
a
problem
with
the
abortion
decisions,
but
as
long
as
this
court
adheres
to
those
decisions--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--congress
can't
roll
them
back.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--those
two
laws
are
very
different,
for
a
reason
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it
could
do
the
second.
it
could
not
do
the
first.
it
cannot
roll
back
a
right
adjudicated
by
this
court's
decisions.
that
is--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--because
of
marbury
v.
madison.
that
really
is
marbury
v.
madison.
but
when
congress
expands
on
the
rights
that
this
court
has
created,
you're
not
in
marbury
land
at
all.
you
are
in
section
5.
mr.
douglas
laycock
because
to
move
it,
to
roll
back
this
court's
decisions
really
would
eviscerate
judicial
review.
it
would
remove
the
independent
protection
for
our
liberty.
but
to
move
in
the
other
direction
provides
a
supplemental
or
second
protection
for
it.
mr.
douglas
laycock
they--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--not
constantly,
but
often,
and
when
that
happens
the
law
is
unconstitutional.
section
5
power,
like
the
article
i
powers,
is
subject
to
the
constitutional
rights
adjudicated
under
other
clauses
by
this
court.
mr.
douglas
laycock
no.
if
it
reduces
the
protection
of
the
other
clause
below
the
level
that
this
court
says
is
the
judicially
enforceable
meaning
of
that
other
clause.
this
court
gets
the
last
word--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--when
it
turns
to
another
clause.
mr.
douglas
laycock
if
that's
this
court's
understanding
of
adarand--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--yes.
mr.
douglas
laycock
my
understanding
is
that
the
section
5
power
is
fully
subject
to
cases
such
as
adarand
and
richmond
v.
croson,
that's
correct,
because
that's
a
judicially
adjudicated
right.
mr.
douglas
laycock
yes.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
easiest
example,
the
'82
voting
rights
act,
is
global.
it
mentions
no
particular
voting
practice.
it
applies
to
any
voting
practice
that
has
a
discriminatory
result.
it
is
enormously
intrusive,
vastly
more
so
than
rfra.
it
remade
politics
in
the
south.
rfra
is
a
mile
wide
and
an
inch
deep.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it's
upheld
in
this
court's
decision
in
mississippi
republican
committee,
and
it's
been
upheld
unanimously
after
full
consideration
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
'82...
the
legislative
record
in
the
'82
act
is
a
mirror
image
of
rfra,
pages
and
pages
of
denouncing
city
of
mobile
v.
bolden
as
a
terrible
decision.
considerable
findings
that
motive
is
difficult
to
prove.
but
what
you
don't
find
in
the
rfra
record
you
do
find
in
that
record
is
the
senate
report
says,
it's
difficult
to
prove,
but
that's
not
the
real
reason.
the
real
reason
we're
doing
this
is
the
court
announced
the
wrong
test.
