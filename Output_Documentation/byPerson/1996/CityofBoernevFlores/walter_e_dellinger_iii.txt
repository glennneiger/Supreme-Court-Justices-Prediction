mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
does
not
require
the
court
to
break
any
new
ground
in
upholding
the
statute,
because
the
act
prevents
what
everyone
would
agree
is
an
actual
violation
of
the
constitution
as
noted
by
this
court.
in
lukumi,
this
court--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
lukumi.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
versus
the
city
of
hialeah.
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
in
that
case,
as
in
many
others,
the
court
said
that
state
rules
that
treat
some
religious
denominations
more
favorably
than
others
violates
the
constitution.
this
court
in
smith
acknowledges
that
when
it
comes
to
accommodations
and
exceptions
some
denominations
will
predictably
be
treated
more
favorably
than
others
and,
in
kiryas
joel,
you
acknowledge
that
this
inequitable
favoritism
will
be
difficult
for
the
courts
to
police.
that
takes
it
right--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
justice
kennedy,
we
do
not...
we
have
not
included...
and
mr.
laycock
tells
me
it
is
a
substantial
burden
and
would
violate
rfra.
we
have
not
included
that
for
the
united
states.
we
entered
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
rfra,
and
the
trial
court
has
not
yet
passed
on
whether
there
is
a
substantial
burden
in
that
case.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
where
you
have...
it
would
be
tested
in
this
court
by
the
standards--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--this
act.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
court
would
have
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
is
not
clear--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
is
not--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
relieving...
that
you're
imposing
a
substantial
burden
if
you're
cutting
back
on
what
was
a
previously
accorded
pure
benefit.
the
substantial
burden
usually
indicates
that
the
congress
is
relieving
a
burden,
but
as
this
court--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
the--
[laughter]
the
relieving
of
a
benefit
may
not
itself
constitute
a
burden.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
it
is
a
burden,
but
we're
talking
about
a
burden
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
but
here,
i
think
the
critical
constitutional
violation
that
congress
is
enacting
prophylactic
rules
to
prevent,
that
is
fully
a
sufficient
basis
for
resolving
this
case
in
favor
of
rfra
in
all
of
its
violations,
is
congress'
concern
expressed
in--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
you
don't
need
to
assume
that
there
is
a
comparable
prevalent
violation,
but
what
you
will
find
when
you
look
at
the
record
are
two
kinds
of
agreed-upon...
that
is,
court...
this
court
agrees,
agreed-upon
violation
of
section
1.
one
that
has
gone
without
mention
here,
where
this
court
itself
has
anticipated
violations
that
can
be
remedied
prophylactically,
is
that
in
the
accommodations
process
more
influential
and
politically
well-connected
religions,
powerful
sector
interests,
will
get
exemptions
when
more
marginal
religions,
particularly
those
that
represent
racial
and
ethnic
minorities,
will
not
get
exemptions.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
breyer,
i--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
my
response
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--my
response
is
quite
clearly--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--congress
is
prohibited
requiring
exemptions
not
otherwise
required
to
some
laws
that
would
not
violate
section
1,
but
it
is
doing
so
prophylactically,
as
this
court
does
in
cases
like
miranda
and
many
others.
it
is
doing
so
prophylactically--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
believe
that
a
number
of
your
rules
are
prophylactic.
in
a
case
like
north
carolina
v.
pearce,
where
all
harsher
sentencing
after
a
pretrial
are
prohibited--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
yes,
but
the
violation
about
which
you
were
concerned
is
the
threat
of
retaliatory
sentencing,
so
you
later
noted
in
michigan
v.
payne
that
that
rule
was
greatly
overinclusive
in
terms
of
the
actual
violations.
that
is,
hostile
sentencing.
but
to,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
return
to
justice
breyer's
question,
what
is
critical
here
is
that
congress
has...
in
the
voting
rights
act
and
in
others,
it
prohibits
a
broader
range
of
practices
in
order
to
get
at
those
that
clearly
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
violation
of
treating...
more
than
one.
the
first
one
is
the
violation
of
treating
some
religious
denominations
more
favorably
than
others.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
i...
no,
that
i
beg
to
differ.
where
different
religious
denominations
aren't
treated
differently
there's
no
question
before,
after,
and
during
smith
it
violates
the
constitution.
it
may
be
difficult
to
remedy
on
a
case-by-case
judicial
approach
where
you're
trying
to
prove
it,
but
it
clearly
is
a
constitutional
violation
if
an
exemption
is
made
for
the
methodist
church
and
the
exemption
is
not
made
for
the
santorias.
if
you...
take
a
case,
for
example,
like
the
district
court
case,
rader
v.
johnson,
from
the
state
of
nebraska,
where
the
university
has
a
rule
that
all
freshmen
must
live
on
campus,
and
the...
mr.
rader
is
a
fundamentalist
christian.
his
sincerity
is
beyond
doubt.
his
family
have
prayer
services
every
morning
throughout
high
school.
for
him,
it
is
an
occasion
of
sin
to
be
forced
to
go
into
a
dormitory
where
there
is
alcohol,
and
profanity,
and
co-ed
living,
and
partying.
it
was
really
going
to
cost
him
his
ability
to
go
to
this
university,
and
his
alternative
is
to
live
a
few
blocks
off
campus
at
the
christian
fellowship
house.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
now...
if
may
just
finish
up.
this
is
more
often
the...
he
is
not
given
an
exemption.
when
it
turns
out
that
the
important
booster
calls
up
because
he
wants
his
son
to
live
with
a
relative.
it
turns
out
that
a
student
who
wants
to
drive
his
sister
to
school...
all
these
are
allowed
exemptions
from
living
off-campus.
in
this
case,
he
was
able
to
prove
it,
but
congress
can
worry
particularly
about
the
marginal
religious
groups
that
won't
get
the
accommodations.
this
is
not
a
made-up
issue.
there
are
many
accommodations
that
are
made,
exceptions
from
zoning
laws,
accommodations
all
the
time.
kiryas
joel
says--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--we
are
concerned
that
we
won't
be
able
to
police
those
in
the
future.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
o'connor,
only
if
you
conclude--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--would
it
require?
i
think
the
answer's
no,
and
assuming
that
you
would
conclude--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--on
the
assumption
that
you
would
conclude
that
it
is
not
a
burden
on
religiously
motivated
conduct
if
you
limit
the
ways
as
a
part
of
a
general
law
in
which
people
can
raise
money,
that
a
substantial...
the
substantial
part
of
the
substantial
burden--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--oh,
no.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
indeed,
because
this...
there's
a
lot...
this
case
comes
up.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
souter,
i
want
to
remind
you,
and
justice
o'connor,
that
the
case
comes
up
on
a
facial
challenge,
so
that
this
court
has
had
no
occasion
to
interpret
what
constitutes--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--my
criteria
would
be,
again
without
having
addressed
this,
whether
a
substantial
burden
is
one
that
really
goes
to
religiously
motivated
conduct
and
restricts
that
religiously
motivated
conduct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
mean,
amos
itself
said
that,
you
know,
economic
activity
is
different
and
may
raise
establishment
clause
problems
if
you
allow
people
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--there
are
instances,
i
think,
where
the
establishment
clause
would
require
you
to
treat
even-handedly
the
raising
of
money.
that
is
an
issue
that,
before
smith,
this
court
knew,
i
think,
how
to
handle.
what
you
see
in
rfra,
if
i
may
return,
because
i
thought
the
theoretical
questions
about
section
5
were
interesting,
but
where
you
have
a
process
that
where
rfra
gives
the
following
solution
to
the
problem
anticipated
in
smith
and
in
kiryas
joel
of
inequitable
accommodations,
and
what
rfra
says
is
that
everyone
whose
free
exercise
of
religion
is
substantially
burdened
gets
the
same
treatment,
whether
they're
a
powerful,
traditional
sect
or
a
marginal
religion.
now,
they
say
that
we
haven't
shown
violations
yet,
but
this
is
a
process
where
congress
actually
anticipated
that
state
and
local
legislative
bodies...
this
is
from
the
senate
report,
at
page
8.
state
and
local
legislative
bodies
cannot
be
relied
upon
to
craft
exemptions
from
laws
of
general
application
that
will
protect
the
ability
of
religious
minorities
to
the
same
extent
as
the
majority.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
in
the...
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--and
congress...
yes,
but
justice
stevens,
congress
was
concerned...
and
they
are
the
specialists
on
the
perils
of
special
interest
exemption
processes.
they
were
concerned
that
if
you
have
a
case-by-case
process,
religions
that,
for
whatever
reasons,
have
more
political
influence
are
able
to
get
their
specific
exemptions.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
is
not
clear
to
me
how
well
one
can
parse
what...
sometimes
some
minorities
are
particularly
well-situated.
others,
like
the
amish,
have
a
very
difficult
time
in
the
legislative
process--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
there
was
an
800-page
record
of
testimony,
groups...
one
religious
group
after
another
testified
as
to
the
difficulties
that
particularly
marginal
religious
groups
have
getting
accommodations.
the
lukumi
had
to
come
all
the
way
to
this
court
before
they
got
a
single
person,
a
single
judge
to
vote
for
them,
and
it's...
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
