what
do
you
mean,
overprotect?
what
does
that
word
mean
as
you're
using
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
just
mean
an
exemption
is
an
overprotection.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
laycock,
do
you
think
it
overturns
reynolds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
even
sure
what
compelling
interest
means
in
the
peyote
case
itself,
because
the
court
was
divided
on
that
issue.
i'm
not
sure
this
is
quite
as
clear
a
concept
as
everyone
assumes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
could
prohibit
states
from
enacting
any
affirmative
action
programs
in
order
to
protect
the
racial
interests
of
the
white
majority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
understanding
of
your
argument,
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
solicitor
general,
does
that
require
us
to
assume,
and
that
may
be
correct,
that,
as
was
the
case
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
voting
rights
act
and
all...
there's
a
long,
well-documented
history
of
violations
of
the
rights
of
the
people
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
are
we...
should
we
assume
as
a
predicate
for
our
decision
that
there
is
a
comparable
violation
of
religious
rights
that's
prevalent
throughout
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
irony
to
that
argument
is,
they
did
it
in
the
peyote
case.
