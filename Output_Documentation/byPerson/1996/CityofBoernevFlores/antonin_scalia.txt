justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hamilton,
when
congress
wrote
this
provision
that's
central
here...
congress
shall
have
power
to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislation
the
provisions
of
this
article...
and
when
that
was
ratified
by
the
states,
was
it
understood
that
the
provisions
of
this
article
included
the
first
amendment?
i
mean,
it
was
clearly
understood
that
it
included
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
was
at
issue
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
a
development
of
this
century.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
indeed,
of
the
latter
two-thirds
of
this
century,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
the
argument
you're
making,
then,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
certainly
that's
a
major
point,
that
when
congress
has
adopted
a
provision
which
it...
or
has
proposed
for
a
constitutional
amendment
a
provision
that
enables
congress
to
prevent
the
unequal
treatment
of
any
citizen,
but
especially
of
blacks,
which
is
what
was
at
issue
at
the...
to
convert
that
into
the
power
of
congress
to
enforce
any
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights,
isn't
that
a
massive
alteration
of
the
original
meaning
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
far
as
our
prior
holdings
go,
have
we
ever
extended
that
power
to
anything
except
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
now,
when
you
say
incorporated
rights,
we've
been
quite
selective,
haven't
we,
in
what
rights
are
incorporated.
we
haven't
said
they
either
all
must
be
incorporated
or
none
of
them.
we
haven't
incorporated
all,
have
we?
we
felt
free
to
leave
out
the
second
amendment,
to
leave
out
aspects
of
the
sixth
amendment,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
can't
we
read
section
5
the
same
way?
section
5
applies
to
certain
of
the
provisions,
those
that
are
clearly
set
forth
in
the
text
of
the
article,
but
not
to
the
ones
that
are
sucked
in
by
much
later
judicial
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutton,
it
seems
to
me
you
overestimate
the
sturdiness
of
this
institution.
we
have
here
a
statute
unanimously
passed
by
congress.
there
was
virtually
no
dissent,
and
you
want
us
to
say
it's
no
good
and
to
judge
future
statutes
on
the
basis
of
such
ineffable
principles
as
the
etiquette
of
federalism.
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
for
this
court
to
have
a
clear
line
which
we
can
hide
behind
and
say
that
this
is
good
and
that
is
bad,
but
to
expect
us
case-by-case
to
go
into
this
kind
of
an
analysis
of
whether
there's
sufficient
factual
inquiry
and
what-not,
do
you
really
think
we
can
carry
that
much
water?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
sure
that
one's
going
to
hold,
too,
aren't
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
a
different
standard
from
goldman?
i
thought
goldman
applied
exactly
the
standard
that
the
statute
wants.
would
goldman
be
overruled
by
this
statue,
which
was
the
yarmulke
case,
whether
an
air
force
officer
can
wear--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
talking
about
that
one.
would
this
statute
overrule
goldman?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
held
there
was
one.
we
held
there
was
one.
would
our
holding
that
there
was
a
compelling
interest
in
the
air
force
not
to
have
anybody
wearing
a
yarmulke,
would
that
holding
be
overturned?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
congress
really
hasn't
tied
our
hands
very
much.
i
mean,
if
we
can
say
that
there's
a
compelling
state
interest
in
not
having
somebody
wear
a
yarmulke,
i
guess
we
have
a
lot
of
running
room
still,
don't
we?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
answering
justice
ginsburg's
question?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
zoning
imposes
a
substantial
burden
on
everybody,
and
to
say
that
it
imposes
it
on
churches
just
as
on
everybody
else
is
to
bring
that
within
this
act,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
significant
legislation
comes
within
this
act,
and
you
must
make
an
exception
for
religious
entities.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
better
off
than
it
would
be
if
it
were
exempt
from
all
laws,
you're
quite
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
while
we're
on
the
establishment
clause,
i
assume
congress
can
enforce
the
establishment
clause
the
same
way
it
can
enforce
the
free
exercise
clause,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
could
pass
a
law
saying
that
no
state
shall
give
churches
a
tax
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
didn't
violate
the
free
exercise
clause,
then...
you
think...
is
that
a
substantial
argument?
must
a
state
give
a
tax
exemption?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
suppose
not,
too.
so
congress
could
pass
such
a
law,
under
the
theory
that
you're
proposing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
would
be
arguing
that
they're
enforcing
another
constitutional
right.
that
is,
in
rolling
back
the
protections
of
freedom
of
religion,
we're
not
acting
under
the
freedom
of
religion
clause.
we're
acting
under
the
establishment
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there
are
many
clauses
that
can
be
used
against
each
other.
in
the
abortion
example
just
given,
we
could
say
we're
using
the
equal
protection
clause.
so
you
can
constantly
adjust
both
downward
and
upward
the
meaning
of
all
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
by
using
one
of
the
other
clauses.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
makes
any
alteration
in
the
nature
of
the
other
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
babalu...
hialeah,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
position
is
that
taxation
is
not
a
burden?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
relieving
of
the
benefit
of
being
exempt
from
tax
in
particular.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
amounts
to
saying
that
taxation
is
not
a
burden,
right,
and
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
you'd
construe
the
statute
to
say
the
same
thing
smith
says.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if
it's
economic
activity
to
raise
money
for
the
church?
what
difference
is
there
between
a
church
that
runs
a
business,
all
of
the
money
of
which
is
devoted
to
the
church,
and
a
church
that
solicits
contributions,
all
of
which
is
devoted
to
the
church?
is...
you're
saying
that
somehow
the
latter
is
more
religiously
motivated
than
the
former?
