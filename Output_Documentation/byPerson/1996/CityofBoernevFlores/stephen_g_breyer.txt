justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
is
it
staggering,
even
under
a
pre-fourteenth
amendment
view...
i
mean,
sorry,
the
ancient
view
that
was
being
described.
[laughter]
why,
even
under
that
view,
is
it
a
staggering
thing
to
say,
well,
there's
certainly
some
protection
in
due
process
liberty
of
people's
religious
freedom,
and
congress
finds
that
when
you
have
laws
that
significantly
affect
that
freedom,
they
should
be
looked
at
very
closely
to
make
certain
there's
good
reason
for
not
making
an
exception.
i
mean,
if
you
just
heard
it
just
like
that,
you'd
think
that's
a...
not
an
unreasonable
or
a
staggering
thing
to
say
as
a
way
of
enforcing
the
protection
that
was
originally
in
that
word
liberty,
whether
then
or
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
is
it
such
an
odd
thing
that
we
should
look
to
the...
scrutinize
the
evidentiary
records
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
for
a
second
to
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice?
does
congress
have
a
degree
of
leeway?
perhaps
it
can't
make
up
any
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment
or
the
fourteenth.
but
where
the
court
itself
has
been
shifting
back
and
forth
over
time,
might
they
not
have
leeway
to
determine
what
the
interpretation
that
they're
trying
to
enforce
is?
if
not,
of
course,
statutes
will
become
constitutional
today,
and
unconstitutional
tomorrow,
and
reconstitutional
the
next
day,
if
this
court
doesn't
perfectly
and
always
hew
precisely
to
the
same
interpretation,
which
i
suspect
in
the
past
it
has
not
always
done.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
this
court
changes
its
mind
over
the
course
of
months
or
years,
the
legislation
becomes
revalid,
then
invalid,
then
revalid,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that--
--well--
--how
does
that
point
fit
into
an
argument
that's
purely
linguistic,
i
think,
but
very
important...
i'm
not
saying
i
accept
it
or
not,
but
i
think
a
linguistic
argument
that
is
made
is
that
smith
says
that
a
general
law
not
motivated
in
purpose
against
a
religion
does
not
violate...
does
not
violate...
the
constitution,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
it
says,
section
2,
congress
shall
have
power
to
enforce
this
article
and
so,
your
argument
goes,
where
a
general
law
that
isn't
motivated
purposely
is
at
stake,
insofar
as
congress
forbids
that,
it's
not
enforcing
the
constitution,
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
constitution
doesn't
prohibit
that.
now,
you're
giving
a
response
to
that,
and
i
just
want
you
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--tie
that
response
to
a
linguistic
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
take
just
what
you're
saying
and
put
it
in
this
linguistic
framework.
congress
passed
this
law
prophylactically
to
prevent
the
violation...
and
now,
fill
in
the
blank.
what
violation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
according
to
smith
that
doesn't
violate
the
constitution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i--
