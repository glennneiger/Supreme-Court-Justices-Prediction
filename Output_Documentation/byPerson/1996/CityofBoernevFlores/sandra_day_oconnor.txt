ms.
hamilton--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--certainly
you
have
to
come
to
grips
with
the
fact
that,
in
situations
such
as
the
voting
rights
act,
where
this
court
had
said
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
was
that
intentional
discrimination
violates
it
but
had
never
applied
the
so-called
effects
test,
yet
congress
passed
laws
of
a
prophylactic
nature
saying
that
discriminatory
effects
would
be
sufficient
to
create
a
cause
of
action
for
discrimination,
and
we
upheld
those.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
are
other
similar
prophylactic
measures,
and
how
do
you
distinguish
those
from
what
congress
now
offers
in
amicus
briefing,
a
rationale
that
it
is
a
prophylactic
measure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
kind
of
unsatisfactory,
really,
to
think
that
all
you'd
get
from
your
argument
is
at
best
a
notion
that
we
would
say
congress
had
to
do
a
better
job
of
making
facts,
a
factual
determination
here,
and
that's
kind
of
an
uncomfortable
position
to
be
in.
i'm
not
sure...
i
mean,
they
can
always
go
back
and
build
a
bigger
record.
they
had
something
they
were
looking
at,
anecdotal
events,
where
they
thought
courts
in
general
were
not
giving
sufficient
attention
to
laws
by
states
and
others
that
might
impinge
on
the
free
exercise
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
put
a
finer
point
on
it,
let
me
ask
you
this.
when
congress
passed
some
of
the
voting
rights
laws,
they
in
effect
made
a
presumption
that
where
there's
been
a
discriminatory
effect
by
a
certain
law
they
must...
that
that
bears
on
intent,
and
it's
likely
there
was
a
discriminatory
intent.
suppose
what
congress
did
here
was
to
prohibit
any
law
that
disproportionately
affects
religious
minorities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
religion.
could
they
have
done
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
could
pass
a
law
that
says
some
state
law,
for
example,
that
disproportionately
affects
a
religious
group
would
be
subject
to
stricter
scrutiny?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
that's
not
what
was
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
two
quick
questions,
please.
do
you
agree
with
ms.
hamilton
that
congress
certainly
could
pass
some
law
that
would
affect
state
laws
as
well,
that
an
apparently
neutral
law
that
disproportionately
affects
religious
groups
would
be
required
to
meet
a
higher
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
a
second
very
quick
question
you
can
answer
yes
or
no.
are
you
relying
at
all,
either
you
or
ms.
hamilton,
on
an
establishment
clause
violation
in
your
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
that
word
appropriate
in
there,
in
section
5,
i
guess,
that
might
bear
some
interpretation
or
weight.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
has
to
be
appropriate.
now,
you
admit,
i
suppose,
that
congress
cannot
come
in
and
overrule
a
decision
of
this
court
it
doesn't
like
by
legislation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
some
indication
that
that
was
what
congress
was
all
about
here,
if
you
read
the
purpose
clause.
does
that
concern
us
at
all?
do
we
have
to
address
that
concern?
it
also
made
it
retroactive,
so
presumably
the
effect
would
be
to
overturn
smith--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--retroactively.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
indeed,
in
smith.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
smith
itself.
if
that
were
to
come
up
again,
i
guess
this
would
be
an
effort
by
congress
to
overturn
that
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
directly
and
retroactively.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
retroactively.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
cases
involving
prisoners
who...
and
i've
seen
several
of
these
since
i've
been
here,
and
petitions
claiming
a
right
in
prison
to
smoke
marijuana
as
part
of
their
religious
practices
and
beliefs.
now,
presumably,
a
refusal
by
prison
authorities
to
make
marijuana
available
to
a
prisoner
based
on
religious
belief
would
now
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would
require
that,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
it
would
be
open
in
the
future
for
that
claim
to
be
made,
or
for
some
child
to
claim
that
their
religious
beliefs
require
them
to
take
weapons
to
school,
or
that
somebody
has
an
absolute
right
under
the
free
exercise
clause
in
the
military
context
to
wear
yarmulkes,
or
other
religious
dress
or
head
gear
as
their
religion
dictates,
and
that
would
overturn,
i
guess,
a
decision
of
this
court
on
that
subject.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
under
this
court's
notion
of
the
needs
and
authority
of
the
military
we've
given
a
good
deal
of
deference
to
military
requirements,
just
as
we
have
to
prison
disciplinary
requirements
in
the
prison
context,
and
so
our
balance
might
well
come
out
differently
in
those
cases
in
the
past.
but
there
appears
to
be
no
room
for
that
kind
of
thing
under
the
law
congress
has
passed,
and
that
isn't
the
test
employed.
congress
did
not,
in
fact,
return
faithfully
to
this
court's
interpretations
in
the
past.
it
did
something
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
by
the
same
token,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
congress
could
pass
a
law
saying
that
any
law
or
regulation...
abortion
is
subject
only
to
the
rational
basis
test,
no
more.
that's
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i'm
talking
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
power
of
congress
under
your
theory
under
section
5.
could
it
do
that,
or
could
it
do
the
reverse
and
say,
any
law
regulating
in
any
fashion
abortions
has
to
be
tested
under
the
strictest
scrutiny
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
it
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
it
do
either
of
those
things?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
let's
go
back
to
the
tax
issue,
and
suppose
the
record
shows
that
only
a
couple
of
major
churches
have
extensive
businesses
that
are
ordinary
businesses
but
the
income
from
those
businesses
is
used
to
support
the
church,
ultimately,
but
they're
ordinary
businesses.
they
run
hotels,
or
they
run
gambling
casinos,
or
have
bingo
games,
or
whatever,
and
it
affects
primarily
the
catholic
church
and
the
lds
church.
let's
say
the
facts
show
that.
and
what
the
state
has
done
is
to
pass
laws
saying
that
all
businesses
that
are
not
part
and
parcel
of
the
church
itself,
but
outside
businesses
that
produce
money
for
the
church,
will
be
taxed
like
every
other
business
is
taxed.
now,
this
law
apparently
would
require
the
strictest
scrutiny
of
that
tax
law.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
can
say
yes
or
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
can
you
read
it
that
way,
as
broadly
as
it's
written?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
after
our
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
agree
with
the
court
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
today
if
i
thought
the
court’s
decision
seven
years
ago
in
employment
division
versus
smith,
set
forth
the
proper
standard
under
the
first
amendment,
but
i
do
not,
and
as
a
result,
i
dissent
from
the
court’s
disposition
of
this
case.
in
order
to
accept
the
court’s
conclusion
that
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
is
unconstitutional,
one
must
first
accept
the
court’s
current
interpretation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
we
could
set
forth
in
smith.
it
was
the
court’s
decision
in
that
case
that
prompted
congress
to
enact
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act.
in
my
view,
smith
does
not
reflect
the
correct
understanding
of
the
federal
free
exercise
clause.
the
court’s
holding
in
that
case
has
harmed
religious
liberty
in
our
nation.
i
would
direct
the
parties
in
this
case
to
address
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment's
guarantee
a
religious
free
exercise
and
set
the
case
for
the
argument
next
term.
our
citizens
hold
many
different
religious
beliefs
and
subscribed
to
a
variety
of
faith.
governmental
regulation
in
our
society
today
is
pervasive.
given
these
characteristics
of
religious
pluralism
and
extensive
government
regulation,
there
are
times
when
a
person’s
religiously
motivated
conduct
conflicts
with
a
generally
applicable
secular
law.
in
smith,
this
court
without
actual
briefing
our
argument
on
the
issue,
held
that
government
need
not
justify
the
burdens
it
places
on
religious
practice.
no
matter
how
extensive,
so
long
as
the
law
imposes
such
burdens
in
a
generally
applicable
law.
in
adopting
this
rule,
the
court
abandoned
the
approach
it
had
taken
to
free
exercise
claims
for
some
decades.
before
smith,
this
court
had
interpreted
the
free
exercise
clause
in
a
number
of
cases
to
require
the
government
to
justify
any
substantial
burden
it
placed
on
religious
free
exercise
with
a
compelling
state
interest
and
a
showing
that
the
burden
was
the
most
narrowly
tailored
means
of
achieving
that
interest.
i
continued
to
believe
that
this
compelling
interest
approach
to
free
exercise
claims
more
faithfully
serves
the
intentions
of
the
framers
of
the
federal
free
exercise
clause.
i
would
therefore
return
to
such
a
rule.
in
my
dissenting
opinion
filed
today,
i
examined
the
early
american
tradition
of
religious
free
exercise
to
gain
insight
into
the
original
understanding
of
that
clause.
the
historical
record
reveals
that
its
drafters
and
ratifiers
viewed
the
free
exercise
clause
as
a
guarantee
that
government
may
not
unnecessarily
hinder
believers
from
freely
practicing
their
religions.
for
example,
nearly
all
the
constitutions
that
the
early
states
which
were
adopted
at
roughly
the
same
time
as
the
federal
bill
of
rights,
guaranteed
free
exercise
of
religion
limited
by
particular
defined
state
interest.
in
the
days
before
the
constitution
was
ratified
when
religious
practice
conflicted
with
the
generally
applicable
law,
state
legislatures
frequently
exempted
believers
from
the
requirements
of
such
laws
including,
for
example,
requirements
of
taking
an
oath,
military
conscription,
and
religious
assessments.
the
framers
of
the
federal
free
exercise
clause
drafted
and
ratified
the
clause
against
that
historical
backdrop.
they
conceived
that
the
nation
recepted
to
voluntary
religious
expression,
not
of
a
secular
society
in
which
religious
excretion
is
tolerated
only
when
it
does
not
conflict
with
a
generally
applicable
law.
the
rule
the
court
adopted
in
smith
provides
a
bright
line
that
is
more
easily
applied
but
it
is
not
faithful,
i
think,
to
the
first
amendment.
i
believe
that
it
is
important
that
this
court
reconsider
its
holding
in
smith.
i
would
do
so
in
this
very
case.
if
the
court
were
to
correct
the
misinterpretation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
set
forth
in
smith,
it
would
simultaneously
put
our
first
amendment
jurisprudence
back
on
course
and
would
allay
the
legitimate
concerns
of
a
majority
in
congress
who
believed
that
smith
improperly
restricted
religious
liberty.
we
would
then
be
able
to
review
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
in
light
of
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
i
therefore
dissent
from
the
court’s
disposition.
