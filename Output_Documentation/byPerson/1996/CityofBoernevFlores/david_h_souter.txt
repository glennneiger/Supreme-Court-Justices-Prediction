justice
david
h.
souter
well,
given
that,
could
we
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
original
question,
which
i
think
was,
in
effect,
why
isn't
there
an
obvious
analogy
between
the
situation
in
the
voting
rights
act,
section
2,
section
5,
and
the
case
that
we
have
before
us?
why...
assuming
that
the
voting
rights
cases
were
correctly
decided,
why
doesn't
this
case
follow
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
basically
it
was
the
candor
of
congress
which
is
going
to
result
in
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
statute
in
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
candor
in
expressing
the
purpose.
in
other
words,
i
take
it,
then,
your
argument
would
be
different
if
congress
had
simply
kept
its
cards
closer
to
its
vest
and
had
said,
we
know
that
under
smith
there
is
a
certain
standard
but,
in
fact,
to
guard
against
violations
that
would
escape
that
standard
we
are
going
to
have
a
slightly
different
test.
that
would
have
been
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
timing,
then.
congress
might
do
this
later
on
if
it
could
point
to
specific
instances
in
which,
under
smith,
something
had
passed
muster,
and
yet
later
on
it
was
determined
that
there
really
had
been
a
motive
to
discriminate
against
religion.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
jumped
the
gun.
is
that
basically
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
basically
i
guess
it
does
boil
down
to
the
fact
that
the
reason
there
is
not
an
analogy
between
the
voting
cases
and
this
one
is
a
factual
record.
congress
did
not
have
a
factual
record.
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
does
congress...
i
assume...
i...
and
that
may
be
so,
but
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
congress
in
effect
has
to
wait.
it
cannot
guard
against
what
it
foresees
as
a
difficulty
by
legislating
in
advance
under
section
5.
it's
got
to
wait
until
there
has
been
a
proven
record
of
violation
for
which
the
standard
of
this
court
is
insufficient
to
guard.
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
take
it...
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
your
argument
is
that
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
rights
incorporated
under
the
incorporation
theory
there
can
be
no
substantive
expansion.
there
simply
can
be
a
kind
of
reasonable
means
ends
jurisdiction
to
enforce,
and
i
take
it
that
is
basically
what
you
would
say
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
would
have
provided
by
its
own
force.
justice
david
h.
souter
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
and
i
guess
where
i'm
not
sure
is,
why
is
it
that
you
make
this
distinction
between
the
protection
of
incorporated
rights
and
the
protection
of
rights
which
are
spelled
out
in
the
text
of
the
amendment?
i
mean,
if
the
incorporation
theory
is
wrong,
then
it's
wrong,
but
if
the
incorporation
theory
is
right,
why
can
we
draw
a
line
between
what
section
5
provides?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
then
how
can
we
draw
the
line
between
the
rights
with...
as
to
congressional
powers
to
incorporated
rights
and
nonincorporated--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
that
still
assumes...
when
you
say
it's
the
upper
limit,
i
assume
you're
talking
in
terms
of
categories,
and
you
are
still
drawing
a
line
between
congress'
power
with
respect
to
incorporated
rights
and
with
respect
to
section
1
rights,
and
i
don't
understand...
if
incorporation
is
not
to
be
overruled,
i
don't
understand
how
that
line
can
be
drawn
on
a
principled
basis.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
are
saying
in
effect
i
think
that
congress
under
section
5
cannot
anticipate
what
it
sees
as
a
likely
difficulty
and
provide
for
it
by
legislation,
but
congress
can
do
that
generally.
why
do
you
draw
that
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
generally
except
in
very
specific
instances...
the
first
amendment
i
suppose
is
a
good
example.
we
do
not
generally
require
congress
to
make
the
kind
of
factual
record
that
i
think
you're
talking
about.
when,
in
fact,
individual
rights
are
being
invaded
as,
for
example,
in
first
amendment
cases,
yes,
we
do
scrutinize
rather
carefully,
but
that
is
not
the
general
rule,
and
i
think
you
are
saying
that
even
though
there
are
no
individual
rights
being
invaded
here,
that
in
fact
that
high
level
of
scrutiny,
that
high
burden
on
congress
to
make
a
record,
is
being
applied,
and
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
it
cannot
anticipate
a
problem
without
in
effect
making
a
factual
record
to
show
that
in
a
specific
instance
the
problem
has
already
occurred.
that
is
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
doesn't
congress
have
the
same
risk
of
massive
usurpation
whenever
it
is
legislating
under
article
i
in
cases
in
which
it's
noninfringing
or
risking
an
infringement
of
individual
rights?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
had
an
enumerated
power
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
and
i
suppose
it's
got
an
enumerated
power
under
section
5.
what's
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
does
the
same
thing.
justice
david
h.
souter
have
you
considered
the
possibility
that
congress
might
have
been
well
within
section
5
with
respect
to
its
insistence
upon,
we'll
call
it
an
effects
test,
but
perhaps
went
too
far
when
it
got
to
enacting
a
compelling
interest
criterion?
can
the
baby
be
split?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
laycock,
could
you
go
back
to
the
argument
that
you
began
a
while
ago
saying
that
there
really
is
no
categorical
distinction
that
can
be
made
between
the
premises,
say,
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
its
effect
test
and
the
present
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
address
specifically
that
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
there
a
legislative
record
of
findings
of
violations,
and
isn't
that
a
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
we
even
get
to
the
act
if
that's
all
congress
did?
given
the
fact
that
the
treatment
of
the
churches
has
been
part
and
parcel
of
the
treatment
of
other
so-called
charitable
organizations,
if
all
congress
did
was
in
effect
require
the
end
of
the
church's
tax
status,
i
suppose
we
would
have
a
suit
right
under
smith
before
we
ever
got
to
rfra,
wouldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
are
saying
some
general
laws
are
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
where...
how
do
we
know
which?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
just
want
to
interpret
what
you're
saying,
and
you're
saying
there
are
two
classes
of
cases
here,
and
some
general
and
neutral
laws
are
okay,
and
what's
your
criterion
for
drawing
that
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
perhaps
the
peyote
smokers
had
help
from
those
outside
of
religion.
[laughter]
