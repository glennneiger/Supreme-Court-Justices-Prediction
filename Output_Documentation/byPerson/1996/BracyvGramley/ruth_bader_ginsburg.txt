justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
levy,
i
thought
you
were
saying--
--this
judge
has
handled...
this
judge
has
handled
6,000-some
criminal
cases,
as
i
understand
it,
and
by
your
standard
they're
all
out
the
window,
and
i
guess
there
are
a
number
of
other
judges
that
were
also
convicted
in
this
chicago
area
who
had
had
similar
experiences,
so
we're
talking
about
a
lot
of
cases.
do
you
have
a
fallback
position
from
that
in--
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
need
any
discovery
to
find
that
out,
and
that's...
i'm
very
confused
by
your
presentation,
because
you
seem
to
be
dealing
with
an
absolute
here,
and
yet
the
only
question
presented
is
whether
you've
shown
enough
to
be
entitled
to
discovery,
so
what
would
you
discover
that
isn't
on
the
public
record?
i
mean,
now
we
have...
the
transcript
of
maloney's
trial
is
a
public
record.
what...
if
you're
successful
here,
what
discovery
would
you
pursue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
be
concrete?
whose
depositions
would
you
take?
what
evidence...
because
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
you're
entitled
to
discovery
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
take
the
deposition
of
the
attorney
that
had
been
appointed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
levy,
may
i
just
ask
you
a
fact
about
bracy?
at
some
place
in
the
record
it
says
he's
also
under
a
death
sentence
in
arizona.
is
that
being
challenged?
i'm
just
wondering
how--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
wants
discovery
for
that
very
purpose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maloney
was
on
trial.
there
was
no...
one
of
the
problems
was,
he
couldn't
get
anything
out
while
the
judge
was
on
trial.
as
i
understand
it,
that
trial
was
over
after
the
hearing
on
the
habeas
in
the
district
court,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
transcript
was
what
he
needed
to
say,
look
at
this
testimony
that
we
have
from
swano
in
this
record.
if
i
can
get
a
chance
to
depose
him,
i
can
get
even
more.
wasn't
that
the
idea?
that's
what
i
thought
the
question
presented
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
and
no
matter
how
strong
the
evidence
of
guilt
may
have
been,
didn't
this
jury
also
make
the
death
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
enough,
in
your
view?
what
would
be
enough?
you...
he
did
show
some
things.
you
said
they
weren't
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
almost
exclusively.
you
really
want
to
modify
that
statement.
