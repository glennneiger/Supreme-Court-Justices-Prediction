justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
assessing
the
probability
of
bias,
am
i
supposed
to
make
some
judgment
as
to
whether
it's
likely
that
a
judge
who
has
committed
himself
to
a
course
of
bribery
is...
in
a
case
where
no
bribe
has
been
offered
or
requested,
is
going
to
be
pro-government?
am
i
supposed
to
assume
that
that
is
a
likelihood,
based
on
human
nature
or
something?
how
might
i
make
this
determination
of
probability
of
bias?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
can...
we
have
some
experience
with
that
that
justifies
that
conclusion,
but
in
this
case
you're
saying
once
on
the
take
the
judge
can
never
be
trusted
to
be
unbiased.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
not
a
good
judge.
he's
a
biased
judge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
any
time
a
judge
has
taken
one
bribe,
all
his
decisions
have
to
be
set
aside?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
we
assume
that
those
were
correct,
and
that
they
were
within
the
discretion
of
an
honest
judge
of
absolute
probity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr....
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
off
your
sentence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
is
one
of
those
witnesses
swano,
mr.
swano?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
i
have
his
name
correctly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
he
one
of
the
key
witnesses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
now,
you
had
his
testimony,
and
as
i
recall
the
timing,
judge
hart
had
made
his
ruling,
but
you
had
swano's
testimony
immediately
thereafter,
or
the
evidence
about
swano?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
move
to
reopen,
or
more
to
reconsider
before
judge
hart?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
did
you
not
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
why
are
you
asking
us
for
extraordinary
relief
so
that
you
can
bring
to
judge
hart's
attention
something
you
didn't
bring
to
his
attention
during
the
time
period
when
you
were
permitted
to
do
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
his
testimony
is
so
critical
that
you
want
us
to
reverse
judge
hart,
it's
a
little
difficult
for
you
to
ask
us
to
do
that
when
you
didn't
bring
it
to
his
attention
when
you
could
have.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
should
be
our
ruling
on
the
substantive
basis
for
relief
in
a
case
where
it
is
shown
that
the
judge
did
have
the
modus
operandi
of
being
very
tough
in
those
cases
where
there
was
no
bribe
in
order
to
facilitate
taking
bribes
in
the
other
cases?
what
should
be
the
ruling
there
in
a
challenge
by
someone
who's
been
convicted
in
a
case
where
there's
no
bribe?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
has
swano's
testimony.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
argument
which
has
at
least
been
brooded
about
here
this
morning
that
if
a
trial
in
which
there
was
no
known
bribery
is
sandwiched
between
trials
in
which
there
was
bribery,
or
was
conducted
at
a
time
when
bribes
were
being
solicited
and
arranged
in
other
cases,
there
is
good
reason
to
believe,
certainly
in
the
elected
system
that
justice
stevens
alluded
to,
that
it
would
be
in
a
judge's
interest
to
look
tough
in
a
case
in
which
he
could
be
tough
at
no
cost
to
himself
without
losing
a
bribe,
and
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
saying
that
discovery
may
uncover
evidence
that
would
substantiate
the
claim
here.
would
that
not
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
at
least
taking
discovery
to
some
step?
i
don't
know
how
far
it
might
go,
but
discovery
is
structured.
wouldn't
that
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
making
a
start
under
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
speculation.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
statement
of
one
reasonable
possibility.
another
reasonable
possibility
is
the
one
that
justice
scalia
referred
to,
and
that
is,
this
fellow
wouldn't
want
to
call
attention
to
the
oddity
of
his
rulings.
he
would
want
to
look
a
little
soft
if
he
could.
that
would
be
a
reasonable
basis,
too.
but
you
start
discovery
not
by
deciding
between
one
or
the
other
of
those
theories.
you
start
discovery
by
determining
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
saying
that
discovery
may
lead
to
evidence
that
would
tend
to
prove
the
probability
that
this
particular
petitioner
would
have
to
prove.
why
hasn't
he
made
that
showing
on
the
kind
of
argument
that
i've
made?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
that
neither
justice
scalia's
view
nor
the
view
that
i've
been
suggesting
is
even
reasonable.
each
is
mere
speculation,
and
could
never
be
the
basis
for
taking
even
a
first
step
in
discovery.
is
that
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
they're
reasonable,
then
we're
beyond
the
point
of
mere
speculation.
yes.
you
can't
define
speculation
as
being
a
choice
between
one
of
two
probabilities.
or
do
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
allegation
that
the
trial
was
set
to
precede
the
trial
where
the
bribe
was
taking
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
first
time
you've
heard
that?
is
judge
maloney...
by
the
way,
has
judge
maloney
conceded
that
he
took
bribes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
this
case,
if
bracy's
trial
was
set
before
the
other
trial,
would...
for
that
purpose,
would
that
automatically
show
bias
that
would
entitle
the
petitioner
to
relief
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
do
believe
that
it
would?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that
would
be
a
ruling
in
this
case
that
was
made
on
grounds
of
bias
and
prejudice
and
for
corruption.
you
say
it's
a
harmless...
a
harmless
ruling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
let's
assume
that
the
trial
is
set
in
order
to
advance
a
conspiracy
to
take
bribes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
would
be
grounds
for--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--upsetting
the
conviction,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
all
of
this
was
before
judge
hart,
was
it
not?
