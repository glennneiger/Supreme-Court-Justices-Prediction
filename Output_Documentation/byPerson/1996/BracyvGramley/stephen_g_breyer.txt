justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
well,
are
there
other...
i
mean,
obviously
what
was
concerning
the
lower
court
is
that
there
are
quite
a
few
judges
in
greylord
who
were
dishonest,
and
there
are
tens
of
thousands,
perhaps,
of
cases
of
criminals
who
are
convicted,
and
they're
worried
about
releasing
them
and
saying
they're
all
going
to
have
new
trials,
since
the
evidence
will
have
disappeared,
and
so
suddenly
they
will
go
free.
all
right,
that's
what
was
concerning
the
lower
court.
now,
what
we're
looking
for
to
consider
is,
are
there
lines
short
of
releasing
all
those
people
that
make
some
sense
in
terms
of
the
fairness
of
the
situation?
you
say
case
by
case,
but
what
are
we
looking
for
case
by
case?
are
there
characteristics?
one
might
be
whether
they
pleaded
guilty
or
not.
are
there
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
thinking
of
what
the
cases
have
held.
i'm
thinking
of
what,
in
your
experience,
would
make
sense
as
a
line.
is
there
anything
short
of
releasing,
let's
say,
all
those
who
didn't
plead
guilty,
or
are
there
other
considerations
that
would
segregate
those
which
are
the
most
likely
to
be
unfair
from
every
criminal
case,
at
least
every
one
without
a
guilty
plea?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
are
you
intending...
you
have
a
proposed
discovery.
you
have
proposed
discovery.
do
you
intend
to
ask
people
who
know
the
judge,
or
perhaps
the
judge
himself,
whether
he
either
said
or
thought
one
theory
or
the
opposite
theory,
whether
he
either
said
or
thought,
i
think
i'll
be
a
little
tougher
in
some
of
these
criminal
cases.
it's
important
to
me
to
get
a
reputation
for
being
tough,
because
i
get
more
money
that
way,
or
some
words
that
could
give
rise
to
that
inference,
or
the
opposite,
which
justice
scalia
suggests
could
well
be
the
case.
do
you
plan
discovery
to
find
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
has
he...
was
he
tried,
or
did
he...
he
didn't
plead
guilty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
has
been
convicted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
to
ask
him
any
of
these
questions.
[laughter]
the
allegation
that
this
trial
was
set
before
the
other
one,
this
is
the...
it's
not
contained
in
any
of
the
arguments
in
the
briefs,
or--
