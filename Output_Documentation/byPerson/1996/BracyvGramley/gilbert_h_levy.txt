mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
support
of
our
discovery
request
in
the
district
court,
we
presented
evidence
that
former
judge
thomas
maloney
systematically
disregarded
his
oath
of
office
in
favor
of
his
self-interest.
he
accepted
bribes
to
fix
murder
cases.
he
had
a
prior
history
before
he
ascended
to
the
bench
as
an
attorney
who
fixed
cases,
and
who
had
ties
to
organized
crime.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
it
would
not
be
any
weaker,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it's
relative
to
the
character
of
the
person
who
is
assumed
to
regard
his
oath
and
office
and
be
fair
in
my
client's
case,
a
factor,
i
think,
that
the
district
court
would
want
to
take
into
consideration
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
i
think
the
standard,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
this
court
indicated
in
murchison,
is
probability
of
unfairness
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
presentation
that
we
made
to
the
district
court
was
sufficient
to
demonstrate
that,
but
if
this
court
decides
that
that's
not
sufficient,
or
a
district...
or
a
court
decides
that's
not
sufficient,
we're
certainly
in
a
position
to
go
forward
and
demonstrate
more.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
no,
your
honor,
if
i
may
explain,
please.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
i
think
all
of
this
court's
analysis
of
this
issue
has
always
looked
to
the
biasing
influence
itself,
and
whether
it
was
sufficiently
strong.
if
the
biasing
influence,
which
in
this
case
was
corruption,
has
been
deemed
to
be
sufficiently
severe,
this
court
has
always
presumed
prejudice
and
has
not
looked
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
judge
in
a
particular
case
was
actually
biased
towards
the
particular
defendant.
however,
if
actual
bias
were
the
standard,
which
we
maintain
it
isn't,
we
believe
that
we
may
be
able
to
show
that
if
we're
given
access
to
the
evidence.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
we
may...
we
think
that
we
could
show
that
for
what...
for
example
as
to
what
judge
maloney
may
have
said
to
the
accomplices,
who
were
government
witnesses,
at
the
time,
who
were
involved
in
the
bribe-taking
process
at
the
same
time
that
my
client's
case
was
tried.
we
may
be
able
to
explore
the
possibility
that
there
was
a
corrupt
relationship
between
judge
maloney
and
the
person
that
he
appointed
to
be
my
client's
attorney.
we
believe
that
we
may
be
able
to
show
examples
of
instances
where
judge
maloney
was
corrupt
in
other
cases
in
which
he
didn't
receive
bribes.
we
believe
that,
as
the
government
sensing
memorandum
in
the
maloney
case
indicated,
we
believe
that
we
may
be
able
to
show
a
lot
of
corruption
going
on
right
at
the
same
time
as
mr.
bracy's
trial,
so
that
judge
maloney
would
have
had
to
have
leaned
in
favor
of
the
state
just
to
be
generally
impartial.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
no,
i
don't...
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke,
justice
scalia.
thank
you.
i
think
that
we...
before
i
can
proceed
with
discovery
we
have
to
show
something
more
than
bare
allegations,
as
i
understand
this
court's
interpretation
of
habeas
rule
6(e).
certainly
in
this
case
i
maintain
that
we
did
show
something
more
than
bare
allegations.
we
showed
quite
a
bit.
we
think
the
showing
was
sufficient
to
allow
us
to
proceed
forward.
the
judicial
corruption,
at
least
in
my
estimation,
is
worse
than
the
type
of
situations
that
this
court
has
previously
held
to
be
a
sufficient
biasing
influence.
it's
worse
than
direct
pecuniary
interest.
it's
worse
than
a
judge
who
may
be
the
subject
of
personal
insults.
it's
worse
than
a
judge
who's
somehow
receiving
income
from
the
process,
or
is
part
of
the
process
which
is
benefiting
from
a
conviction.
at
least
in
those--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--thank
you,
justice
o'connor.
the
substantive
standard
is
well-established
in
the
murchison
case.
it's
probability
of
unfairness.
the
good
cause--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--for
judicial
bias.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
ultimate
relief.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
the
standard
under
6(a)
is,
if...
may
be...
it
demonstrated
sufficient
facts
to
indicate
that
the
petitioner
may
be
entitled
to
relief
under
the
substantive
standard,
we
maintain
that
we've
already
got
enough
to
satisfy
the
substantive
standard,
but
certainly
at
least
we've
shown
good
cause
that
we
may
be
able...
entitled
to
relief.
there's
no
exact
formulation,
justice
o'connor,
but
presumably
it...
we
have...
in
order
to
get
discovery
we
would
have
to
show
something
less
than
what
we
would
be
required
to
show
in
order
to
be
able
to
obtain
ultimate
relief.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
there...
based
upon
this
court's
past
decisions,
those
types
of
assumptions
have
been
made.
for
example,
in
the
contempt
cases,
where
the
defendant
or
a
party
is
insulting
the
judge,
this
court
in
the
past
has
made
an
assumption
that
that
type
of
direct
personal
on
attack...
personal
attack
on
the
judge
will
be
so
disquieting
to
the
judicial
person
that
he
or
she
will
be
unfair,
so
i
think
at
a
certain
threshold
that
type
of
assumption
is
drawn.
however,
i
don't--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--it
certainly
would
seem
that
somebody
has
so
little
concern
for
the
oath
that
he's
going
to
take
bribes
to
fix
murder
cases
is
probably
less
of
a
reliable
person
to
be
deemed
to
be
a
good
judge
than
somebody
who's--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--or
a
fair
judge.
somebody
who's
got
a
past
track
record
of
unfairness,
i
think
it's
fair
to
make
an
assumption
that
that
person
isn't
going
to
be
fair,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
much
more
compelling
assumption
than
somebody
who
may
simply
have
had
his
or
her
feelings
hurt
by
a
party.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
my
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
we
do
have
enough
evidence
right
now,
but
if
the
court
decides
that
we
need
to
show
more,
i
think
there's
a
whole
wealth
of
information
out
there,
and
we
can
show
more.
answering
justice
kennedy's
question,
i
think
that
it's
more
than
an
inference
about
the...
how
the
person
will
behave.
it's
a...
if
you
will,
it's
a
structural
defect.
the
judge
is
the
captain
of
the
ship
in
any
judicial
proceeding.
he
or
she
is
the
rudder.
if
the
person
is--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--that
is
the
inference.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
the
type
of...
certainly
the
magnitude
of
bribery
that's
involved
with
judge
maloney
is
pretty
much,
in
my
estimation
at
least,
analogous
to
a
rudderless
ship.
you
simply--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--as
i
understand
the--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--yes.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
my
fallback
position
is
the
dissent
in
the
murchis...
or
in
ward
v.
monroeville,
which
is
that
it's
a
fact-specific
analysis.
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
circumstances.
certainly,
this
case
may
be
different
than
the
case
where
the
judge
took
a
single
bribe
in
his
or
her
career
years
ago
and
you
take
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
we
submit
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
so
egregious
and
so
aggravated,
there
was
a
whole
lot--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--i'm
sure
that
some
of
them
involved
guilty
pleas.
some
of
them
were
minor
matters.
i
think
in
numerous
instances
there's
nothing
pending--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--any
situation...
no,
not
the
guilty
plea.
that's
non...
predominantly
nondiscretionary,
but
in
any
situation
where
a
court--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--that's
correct.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
this
court's
cases
on
judicial
bias
have
never
discussed
a
per
se
rule.
what
they've
talked
about
is
degrees
of
bias
and
whether
or
not
the
biasing
influence
is
sufficient
so
that
the
appellate
court
can
say--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--well,
certainly
one
consideration
would
be
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
another
consideration
would
be
the
extent
to
which
the
judicial
officer
made
discretionary
rulings
which
potentially
affected
the
outcome
of
the
case.
another
consideration
would
simply
be
the
nature
of
the
biasing
influence,
a
fact-specific
determination
of
whether
or
not
in
a
particular
case
the
biasing
influence
was
so
severe
that
the
appellate
court
can
say
with
some...
or
the
reviewing
court
can
say
with
some
confidence
that
there
was
a
probability
of
unfairness.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
with
all
due
respect,
justice
o'connor,
it
seems
difficult
to
me
to
imagine
a
situation
in
a
serious
criminal
matter
where
the
judge
is
not
making
discretionary
rulings
all
along
the
way
which
might
in
some
fashion
have
an
impact
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
or
even
if
there's--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--even
if
we
assume
that
they're
correct,
justice
kennedy,
we
cannot
assume,
particularly
under
these
circumstances,
that
the
judge
did
not
take
his
or
her
self-interest
into
consideration
in
deciding
how
she...
how
he
or
she
might
make
these
discretionary
rulings,
and
that's
really
the
problem.
if
you
simply
look
at
the
correctness
of
the
rulings
that
the
judge
made,
then
you
insulate
a
whole
category
of
judicial
bias
from
appellate
court
scrutiny,
because
surely
judges
can
influence
or
impact
the
outcome
of
cases
without
appearing
to
abuse
their
discretion.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
that's
fine,
justice
souter.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
okay.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
justice
souter,
i
think
that
the
facts
are
even
more
compelling.
i
think
the
evidence
would
show
that
the
bribe
negotiations
for
the
lenny
chow
case,
which
was
a
$100,000
fix
to
acquit
three
murder
defendants,
was
going
on
at
the
same
time
as
my
client's
trial.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
on
the
assumption
that
we
have
to
show
more
than
what
we've
already
shown,
and
that
we
have
to
point
to
specific
instances
which
may
raise
inferences
of
bias,
i
believe
that
we
may
be
able
to
show
that
there
was
more
than
simply
a
temporal
connection
between
my
client's
case
and
the
lenny
chow
case,
the
murder
bribe
case--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--it
appears,
justice
ginsburg,
in
this
case...
and
i'm
not
saying
that
the
record
shows
it
now,
but
i
think
there's
at
least
some
suggestion
of
this
in
the
record,
that
judge
maloney
appointed
an
attorney
who
was
a
former
associate
of
his
with
the
understanding
that
this
attorney
would
not
object
to
the
timing
of
the
bracy
case...
in
other
words,
would
announce
that
he
would
agree
to
go
to
trial
in
a
month
on
a
triple
homicide
case,
followed
by
another
triple
homicide
case...
just
so
that
the
bracy
case
could
take
place
before
the
chow
case
and
the
bracy
case
would
then
be
camouflage
for
the
bribe
negotiations
in
the
chow
case.
i
believe
that
if
we're
given
an
opportunity
for
discovery
we
can
show
that.
i
think
that
that
would
simply...
that
would
do
more
than
simply
raise
an
inference
of
bias.
i
think
that
would
show
actual
bias
in
this
particular
case.
if
that's
what
we're
required
to
show
if
given
the
fair
opportunity,
we're
prepared
to
do
that.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
i
would
take
the
deposition
of
the
attorney,
i
would
take
the
deposition
of
judge
maloney,
i
would
take
the
deposition
of
the
gentleman
who
assisted
judge
maloney
with
the
bribe,
the
persons
who
were
accomplices,
who
were
government
witnesses
at
the
time
of
the
maloney
criminal
trial,
persons
who
are
not
likely
to
be
available
to
us
or
cooperate
with
us,
or
give
us
meaningful
answers,
unless
they're
given
a
subpoena
and
forced
to
sit
down
and
answer
questions
under
oath
in
a
formal
discovery
process.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
justice
scalia--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--the
assumption
that
i'm
asking
this
court
to
draw,
justice
scalia,
is
not
so
much
that
as
the
assumption
that
persons
who
are
dishonest
on
numerous
occasions
are
likely
to
be
dishonest
and
self-interested
and
disregard
their
oath
of
office
in
other
occasions...
it's
difficult
for
me
to
tell
the
court
without--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--the
close
connection
is
that
in
judicial
proceedings,
when
judge
maloney
took
an
oath
to
be
fair,
he
wasn't,
and
i
think
it's
certainly
a
fair
and
logical
inference
to
draw
from
that
that
he
would
be
dishonest
or
self-interested--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--he
had
a
reputation
as
a
law-and-order
judge.
my
other,
i
think
fair
assumption
from
what
we
know
about
judge
maloney,
justice
scalia,
is
that
somebody
in
that
situation
is
going
to
be
paranoid
or
concerned
that
he
or
she
might
be
discovered.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
i'm...
excuse
me.
[laughter]
i
was
speaking
in
general
terms.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
judge
maloney
is
going
to
be
paranoid
or
concerned
that
he's
going
to
be
under
investigation
by
the
state's
attorney's
office
or
the
u.s.
attorney's
office,
and
i
think
a
reasonable
and
fair
assumption
is
that
he's
going
to
do
things
in
other
cases
to
take
the
heat
off.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
the
purpose
of
the
discovery
is
to
find
out
whether
or
not
he...
there
is
a
likelihood
in
mr.
bracy's
case
that
he,
judge
maloney,
made
decisions
on
the
basis
of
things
other
than--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--facts
of
the
law.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
certainly,
justice
breyer,
in
keeping
with
the
idea
that
this
is
a
fact-specific
determination,
what
we
would
do
is,
we
would
ask
the
witnesses
what
was
his
attitude,
what
was
his
demeanor,
what
was
his--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--mr.
swano--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--justice
kennedy,
it's
mr.
swano,
who
is
the
attorney
who
gave
the
bribes
in
most
of
these
cases,
including--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--he
is,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
swano's
testimony
in
the
maloney
case,
which
focused
more
narrowly
on
the
issues
in
the
criminal
trial,
would
have
been
available
to
us
after
the
proceedings
were
concluded,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
did
not.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
we
felt
we'd
made
a
sufficient
showing.
at
the
time,
we
felt
that--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--the
relief
that
we're
asking
is
not
access
to
the
material,
justice
kennedy,
that
was
publicly
available,
which
may
or
may
not
have
bearing
on
the
precise
question
that
the
judge--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--that
which
we
could
have
brought
to
justice
hart's
attention,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
the
same
thing
as
what
we're
asking
for.
what
we're
asking
for
this
court
to
do
is
precisely
what
we
asked
judge
hart
to
do
and
he
said
he
wouldn't,
which
was
an
opportunity
to
depose
these
people
to
ask
them
the
precise
questions
that
justice
breyer
posed
and
justice
scalia
posed,
which
is,
how
did
judge
maloney
feel
about
the
cases
where
he
wasn't
bribed,
and
was
there
a
relationship
in
terms
of
judge
maloney's
attitude
between
the
cases
where
he
was
bribed
and
the
cases
where
he
wasn't
bribed,
and
that
information
wasn't
publicly
available
then,
isn't
publicly
available
now,
and
the
only
way
that
we're
going
to
be
able
to
get
at
it
is
through
the
discovery
process,
formal
discovery
process.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
that's
being
challenged,
justice
ginsburg.
there
are
proceedings
now
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
this
is
a...
it's
a
permutation
on
a
previous
argument,
justice
kennedy.
this
is
based
upon
the
record.
it's
not
based
upon
anything
that
counsel
didn't
have
available,
or
if
i
might
simply
indicate
what
the
argument...
but
no,
i've
not...
to
answer
the
court's
question
squarely,
i
have
not
made
this
exact
same
argument
on
a
previous
occasion,
but
it
is
supported
by
the
record.
and
the
basis
in
the
record
is
that
robert
mcdonald
was
appointed
in
the
middle
of
june
1981.
several
weeks
after
he
was
appointed,
he
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
go
to
trial
in
july
of
1981--
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
--it
was.
he
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
go
to
trial
in
july
of
1981.
on
july
20,
which
is
the
first
day
of
mr.
bracy's
trial,
the
state
announced
that
it
intended
to
introduce
the
evidence
of
the
arizona
murder
case
as
aggravation
evidence
in
the
event
that
there
was
a
conviction
on
the
homicide
charge,
and
although
another
attorney
who
represented
a
codefendant
mr.
hooper
asked
for
a
continuance
because
he
needed
more
opportunity
to
prepare,
mr.
mcdonald
didn't
say
a
thing.
and
the
additional
fact
that
i
would
throw
into
the
equation
there
is
simply
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
record
that
was
before
judge
hart
that
there
was
a
professional...
a
previous
professional
connection
sometime
between
mr.
mcdonald
and
former
judge
maloney,
and
that,
to
me
at
least,
raises
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
some
kind
of
fix
as
to
the
timing
of
the
trial.
if
i
may
conclude,
chief
judge
posner
in
his
majority
opinion
in
the
seventh
circuit...
and
i
would
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
top
of
page
82
of
the
joint
appendix...
said,
we
are,
it
is
true,
speculating
about
the
likely
impact
of
mr.
maloney's
corruption
on
the
rulings
that
he
made
at
the
trial
of
these
petitioners.
we
also...
may
i
finish?
mr.
gilbert
h.
levy
thank
you.
