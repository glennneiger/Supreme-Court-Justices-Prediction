justice
david
h.
souter
there's
one
answer
that
you
are
not
giving
to
justice
breyer's
questions
that
i
thought
you
were
going
to
give,
and
i
had
intended,
actually,
to
raise
this
with
opposing
counsel,
but
let
me
raise
it
with
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
would
have
thought
that
you
would
have
argued
that
one
way
to
narrow
the
category
down
was
to
look
for
evidence
that
raised
a
particular
inference
of
bias
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
question,
at
the
time
of...
your
client
was
tried,
as
opposed
simply
to
a
general
shotgun
corruption
approach
pervasive
throughout
the
judge's
entire
tenure.
and
i
thought
that
you
had
such
an
argument
here,
because
i...
and
this
is
where
i
want
you
to
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
the
record
indicated
that
in
a
case
that
was
tried
after
yours
a
bribe
had
been
solicited
and...
or
agreed
upon
prior
to
the
trial
of
your
case,
so
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
reason
for
supposing
that
the
judge
would
say,
i'm
going
to
dump
the
case
that
follows
this
one,
and
therefore
it's
important
to
me,
if
i'm
not
getting
a
bribe
here,
to
come
down
hard
on
the
state's
side
so
that
i
will
look
good
here
and
hence
not
appear
too
peculiar
there.
do
you...
is...
are
the
facts
such
that
you
could
make
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
claiming
that
the...
or
maybe
you
are
claiming
that
the
writ
is
subject
to
dismissal
right
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
the
petition
for
writ
is
subject
to
dismissal
right
now.
is
that
your
position?
