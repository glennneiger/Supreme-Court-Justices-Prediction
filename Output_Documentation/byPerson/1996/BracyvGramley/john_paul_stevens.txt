mr.
levy,
could
you
clarify
for
us,
of
the
6,000
figure,
does
that
include
all
guilty
pleas,
for
example,
the
6,000
cases?
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
your
position
require
that
the
guilty
plea
convictions
be
set
aside?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
maybe
in
most
of
the
jurisdictions
the
guilty
pleas
represent
90
or
95
percent
of
the
convictions,
so
maybe
a
lot
of
these
were
not
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
kind
of
a
basic
question,
ms.
preiner?
supposing
instead
of
a
judge
who's
accused
of
bribery
and
so
forth,
this
man
had
been
tried
by
an
accountant
or
a
law
clerk
or
somebody
else
who
was
not
properly
elected
to
office
and
was
not
a
lawyer,
and
so
forth,
but
you
look
at
the
record
and
he
got
a
fair
trial.
would
that
be
subject
to
setting
aside?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
the
question
is
whether
he
had
a
judge
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
better
to
be
tried
by
a
corrupt
judge
then
by
an
accountant,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
under
your
answer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--all
accountants,
we'd
set
it
aside,
even
the
most
brilliant,
fair-minded,
honest--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course,
that's
the
issue
here.
when
the
judge
is
corrupt,
have
you
had
a
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
more
in
this
record.
there
is
evidence,
as
i
remember
it,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
that
there
was
a
case
where
he
convicted
in
a
case
where
the
evidence
indicated
he
normally
would
have
acquitted,
and
did
so
in
order
to
enhance
his
reputation
as
a
tough
judge.
isn't
there
evidence
of
that
kind
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
this
isn't
like
a
lot
of
requests
for
discovery
where
it's
totally
a
fishing
expedition.
you
don't
have
anything
to
go
on.
you
just
want
to
prowl
around
and
find
something.
we
at
least
start
with
established
facts
that
this
judge
took
bribes
in
a
significant
number
of
cases
at
roughly
the
same
time
as
he
tried
this
case,
so
you're
starting
off
with
some
factual
basis
for
saying
we
ought
to
take
a
little
harder
look
at
the
whole
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you're
not
going
to
argue
that
we
apply
harmless
error...
if
there's
proof
of
this
guy
was
corrupt
in
this
very
case
and
made
some
rulings
because
he
was
bribed,
you
wouldn't
say
that
there's
harmless
error
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
before
you
finish,
would
you
comment
at
all
on
whether
you
think
there's
any
significance
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
not
only
some
distinguished
illinois
lawyers,
but
former
prosecutors
and
former
u.s.
attorneys,
suggesting
discovery
is
appropriate
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
just
to
bring
back
the
point
justice
o'connor
raised,
we're
really
not...
we
don't
really
have
to
decide
that.
we
just
have
to
decide
whether
the
situation
is
sufficiently
serious
that
it
demands
the
fullest
possible
investigation
before
we
decide
what
kind
of
rule
should
be
adopted
in
a
case
like
this,
because
there...
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
something
might
be
learned
by
discovery
that
sheds
light
on
the
whole
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
problem
goes
beyond
this
one
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
back
to
the
amicus
brief,
it
does
include
a
fair
number
of
lawyers
who
do
not
practice
on
behalf
of
criminal
defendants,
such
as
former
governor
thompson--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
former
justice
seymour
simon...
there
are
quite
a
few
in
there
who
are
not
representing
defendants
now,
is
that
not
right?
