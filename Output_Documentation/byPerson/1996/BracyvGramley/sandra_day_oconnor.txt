well,
mr.
levy,
i
think
we
need
to
focus
on
two
things
here.
one,
what
is
the
substantive
standard
that
would
entitle
you
to
relief
at
the
end
of
the
day,
and
secondly,
and
most
importantly
for
your
case,
what
is
the
standard
for
showing
good
cause
under
the
rule
to
get
discovery?
you
have
to
deal
with
both
those
things
and
i
think
distinguish
between
them,
and
i'm
not
sure
you
are.
i'm
just
hearing
a
lot
of
generalizations
about
corruption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
levy,
you're--
--you
know,
i
can
imagine...
i
can
imagine
cases
where
it...
the
case
has
gone
to
a
jury
trial,
and
there's
no
provable
fault
in
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury,
and
there
was
no
single
evidentiary
ruling
that
could
be
said
to
be
improper
in
any
way,
and
why
should
that
case
be
upset,
even
though
the
judge
turns
out
to
have
been
a
very
bad
actor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
you,
like
the
petitioner,
need
to
be
careful
about
what
we're
being
asked
to
do
here.
i
thought
this
issue
was
whether
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
discovery
under
the
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
good
cause
for
discovery
to
take
depositions
of
the
judge
and
the
attorney
that
was
appointed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
we
have
to
decide
is
what
would
amount
to
good
cause,
and
what
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
denying
discovery.
