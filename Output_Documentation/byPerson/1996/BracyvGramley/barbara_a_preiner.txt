ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
due
process
clause
entitles
a
defendant
to
a
fair
trial.
in
the
context
of
the
issues
of
this
case,
that
question
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
this
defendant
was
tried
by
a
judge
who
had
a
direct
interest
in
the
outcome
of
his
case.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
petitioner
received
a
fair
trial
from
a
judge
and
a
jury.
the
evidence
against
him
was
strong,
and
is
not
challenged
here.
the
judge's
legal
rulings
have
been
reviewed
twice
by
the
illinois
supreme
court--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i
believe
it
would
be,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that
at
minimum
you
are
entitled
to
a
trial
by
a
judge
and
a
jury.
if
we
have
an
imposter
as
the
judge,
i
believe
that
that--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--whether
he
had...
yes,
a
duly
elected
judge,
and
he
was
tried
by
the
judge
and
a
jury.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
suppose
it
depends
on
the
accountant,
but--
[laughter]
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
but
we
would
assume--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--well,
i...
certainly
no
slur
meant
on
accountants,
or
judges,
but
yes,
we
would
assume
that
since
the
people
have
elected
a
certain
person
to
sit
in
judgment
on
his
fellows,
that
it
would
be
his
obligation,
and
we
haven't
done
that
for
any
accountants,
so
they
would
not
be
within
that
category
that
we
trust
with
these
decisions.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
yes.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
well,
i
believe...
yes,
and
i
think
that
he
has
had
a
trial
here,
and
he
hasn't
shown
that
the
judge
was
corrupt
in
his
case.
i
think
that's
the
distinguishing
factor
here.
what
counsel
would
have
you
assume
is,
all
he
has
to
show
is
that
this
judge
once
took
a
bribe,
or
took
a
bribe
in
another
case,
and
that
any
case
that
he
ever
ruled
on
from
that
point
on
can
no
longer
stand
because--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i
believe
that
that's
reading
that
evidence
too
broadly.
you
do
have
statements
from
another
convicted
lawyer
who
said
that
he
had
a
case
in
front
of
this
judge
that
he
believed
should
have
been
a
not
guilty
verdict,
and
that
the
judge
in
fact
convicted
his
client,
and
he
took
that
as
a
message
to
him
that
he
needed
to
pay
the
judge
money
in
order
to
get
an
acquittal.
now,
that's
one--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
that
a
bribe
had
been
solicited
in
particularly
that
case,
but
clearly
this
lawyer--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--he
had
a
history
of
engaging
in
that
business
practice
with
this
judge,
and
furthermore,
we
only
have
this
lawyer's
word
for
it,
that
it
would
have
been
an
acquittal.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
that
was
a
bench
trial.
what
the
petitioner
here
is
asking
you
to
do,
essentially,
is
to
grant
him
the
writ.
i
mean,
his
request...
as
he
has
just
admitted
here
in
oral
argument,
his
request
for
discovery--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--that--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--and
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
issue
that
the
court
framed,
and
that
is
certainly
the
issue
that
we
briefed,
but--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--clearly,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
was
just
commenting
that
counsel
this
morning
was
saying
he
believes
he's
actually
proven
enough
to
get
the
writ.
he
believes
not
only
has
he
shown
good
cause
for
discovery,
he
believes
that
he
has
shown
that
he
should
be
granted
the
writ
for
his
client
here.
it's
our
position--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i
believe
that
if
he
could
show
that
there
was
a
modus
operandi
whereby
the
judge
was
ruling
more
harshly
against
defendants
in
order
to
cover
his
bribe-taking,
or
in
order
to
balance
his
win-loss
statistics,
then
i
believe
that
he
would
be
able
to
show
actual
bias
in
his
case.
he
hasn't
been
able
to
do
that
here.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
but
your
honor,
in
order
to
even
bring
the
habeas
petition
to
the
court
and
ask
for
discovery,
he
has
to
show
that
there
is
at
least
some
basis
for
his
claim.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
he...
actually,
he
doesn't
have
swano's
testimony.
he
didn't
really
support
this
request
or
this
petition
for
writ
with
anything
to
the
court.
as
you
pointed--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i
believe
that
if
what--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i
believe
that
it
was
properly...
it
was
subject
to
dismissal
by
the
court
below.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
believe
that
the
transcript
was
unavailable.
i
believe
that
the
judge's
trial
was--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i
think
that
that
is
certainly
something
that
he
could
have
argued.
what
he
did
argue,
though
was,
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
conduct
a
survey
of
the
judge's
win-loss
record,
and
the
court
said,
you
could
have
done
that
without
any
kind
of
discovery,
and
he
said,
and
then
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
look
at
judge
maloney's
trial
and
try
to
get
some
idea
of
what
evidence
there
might
be
against
him,
and
the
court
said,
well
now
at
this
point
you
could
have
done
that,
too,
without
discovery.
so
all
you're
left
with
is
that
he
wants
to
depose
some
people.
he
didn't
bring
to
the
court
that
he
had
talked
to
the
defendant's
lawyer
at
trial.
he
hasn't
talked
to
any
other
witnesses.
he
hasn't...
he
hasn't
done
anything
to
show
that
there
might
be
some
basis
that
will
ultimately
disclose
that
there
was
bias
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
that's
nothing
more
than
speculation.
that's
nothing
more
than--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--because
i
believe
that
what
we
have
here
then
is
just
a
range
of
speculation.
you
can
speculate
that
the
judge
was
more
harsh
in
these
cases.
you
can
speculate
that
he
was
more
lenient
in
these
cases.
you
could
speculate
that
if
he
was
being
unfair
in
one
case,
he
balances
that
off
by
being
extremely
fair
in
another
case.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
believe
they're
all
reasonable.
they're
all
reasonable
speculation.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
suppose
speculation
would
be
among
a
range
of
probabilities.
i
think
that--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--actually,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
i
think
this
is
a
fishing
expedition.
it's
nothing
more
than
that.
he
can't
show
any
bias
by
this
judge
against
him
in
his
case.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
frankly,
judge,
this
is
the
first
time
i've
heard
that
claim
made.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
he
never
has.
he
has
never
admitted
any
guilt.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
he
did
not
plead
guilty.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
he
has
been.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
believe
that
the
record
will
reflect
on
what
date
this
trial
occurred,
and
beyond
that
i
don't
think
anyone
has
ever
suggested
that
there
was
a
specific
reason
for
timing
with
respect
to
the
trial
date
here.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
sufficient
to
show
that
there
was
bias
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
do
not.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
don't
believe
that
he
has...
i
don't
believe
that
there's
ever
been
any
suggestion
that
this
attorney
was
engaged
in
that...
that
he
didn't
properly
prepare
for
this
case,
or
that
he
agreed
to
some
short
time
period
for
the
setting
of
this
trial.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
no.
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
have
been
made
for
that
purpose,
and--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--then,
absolutely
that
would
be
evidence
of
bias
in
this
case.
if
we
are
assuming--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--that
there's
a
conspiracy.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
believe
that
would
be.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
again
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
extremely
strong
against
this
defendant,
and
it
was
tried
to
a
jury,
and
there
has
been
no
showing
before
the
illinois
supreme
court
or
in
front
of
the
district
court
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
judge--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i
would
never
say
that,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
they
did.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
the
competing
interest
in
balancing
the
finality
of
the
judgment
and
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner's
interest
in
not
being
improperly
confined,
we
submit
that
he
had
to
show
more
in
order
to
require
the
court...
in
order
to
show
good
cause
why
he
should
be
allowed
to
explore
all
of
these
actions
that
he
suggests
here
today
he
would
have
liked
to
explore.
and
with
all
due
respect,
we
believe
that
he
could
have...
he
could
have
done
some
of
these
things
that
he
is
asking
the
court
for
permission
to
do,
and
i
believe
the
court
thought
that,
too.
they
thought
simply
that
he
hadn't
done
his
homework
before
he
came
to
the
court
with
this
request
for
discovery.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
i
sympathize,
and
certainly
the
attorney
general
sympathizes
also
with
those
lawyers
and
their
perception
that
there
is
a
taint
on
the
judicial
system
in
illinois
because
of
the
scandal,
of
the
greylord
scandal.
however,
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
upset
a
valid
legal
conviction
in
this
case
involving
a
defendant
who
was
clearly
guilty--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--well--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
anything
will
be
learned
by
discovery
in
this
case.
i
don't
believe
that
there's
been
any
showing
that
there
is
anything
out
there
to
be
learned
by
these
various
methods
that
he
asks
to
employ.
we
believe
that
he
has
to
show
some
basis,
some
evidence
on
each
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
his
claim
before
he
can
get
discovery,
and
we
don't
believe
that
he
has
done
that
here.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
for
example,
your
honor,
if
he
could
say,
i
did
an
inventory
of
all
the
trial
court's
rulings
in
this
case,
and
out
of
187
rulings
that
he
made,
180
of
them
went
in
favor
of
the
state,
and
here's
why
they
were
wrong.
if
he
could
have
said,
for
example,
this
was
a
bench
trial,
and
all
the
rulings
went
against
my
client.
if
he
could
have
said
something
like,
i
have
talked
to
mr.
mcdonald,
the
lawyer
who
represented
mr.
bracy,
and
he
tells
me
that,
you
know,
this
really
wasn't
a
fair
trial.
he
really
thought
something
was
going
on
here.
if
he
could
have
brought
something
like
that
to
the
court
to
provide
some
basis
for
believing
that
there
would
be
proof
of
actual
bias
in
this
case,
but
there
is
nothing
like
that
here.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
former
prosecutors,
yes.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
some
of
them
do,
yes.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
almost
exclusively
on
behalf
of
defendants.
your
honors,
our
point...
and
justice
o'connor,
as
you've
pointed
out,
the
question
here
is
a
discovery
issue.
we
believe
that
counsel
has
not
made
a
sufficient
showing
for
good
cause
for
discovery.
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
it
includes--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--and
many
law
school
professors
and
people
from
all--
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
--well,
the
lawyers
who
are
criminal
defense
lawyers
on
there
are
lawyers
who
represent
criminal
defendants.
[laughter]
ms.
barbara
a.
preiner
many
of
those
lawyers
have
a
varied
practice,
and
i'm
sure
that
they
represent
many
noncriminal
defendants,
too,
but
there
are
a
fair
number
of
defense
lawyers
on
there.
your
honors,
we
simply
believe
that
he
has
not
made
the
showing
that
he
needed
to
make
to
show
good
cause
for
discovery
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
denying
that
request.
we
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit
appropriately
affirmed
that.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
uphold
that
decision.
