we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-6133,
william
bracy
v.
richard
b.
gramley.
mr.
levy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
your
case
be
any
weaker
if
he
had
never
accepted...
never
given
bribes
when
he
was
an
attorney
and
simply
had
accepted
them
when
he
was
a
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
mention
the
attorney
business?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--what
standard
are
you
arguing
for
here
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
do
you
think
it's
necessary
to
show
that
the...
judge
maloney
made
some
request,
either
by
inference
or
expressly,
in
this
case,
or
do
you
think
it's
only
necessary
to
show
that
he
made
it
in
other
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
probability
of
unfairness,
you're
saying
that
if
you
can
show
in
some
other
cases
that
he
asked
for
a
bribe,
or
that
perhaps
he
suggested
if
you
didn't
give
him
a
bribe
he
would
be
very
tough
on
you,
that
would
be
enough,
without
showing
anything
in
this
particular
case?
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
i
suppose
you
would
show
that
by
something
said
to
one
of
your
client's
lawyers
by
the
judge
during
his
trial.
i
would
think
you'd
be
able
to
get
that
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
your
position
is
that
you've
got
enough
evidence
really
right
now,
i
suppose.
the
man
did
take
bribes,
and...
in
other
cases,
and
therefore
you
say
the
permissible
inference
is
that
he's
unfair
in
all
cases.
it
doesn't...
that
doesn't
seem
logical
to
me,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
your
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
justice
kennedy's
particular
question?
what
if
a
judge
has
taken
one
bribe,
and
has
sat
there
for
15
years?
all
of
his
cases
go
down
the
drain
under
due
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
the
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levy,
is
there
any
doubt
about
judge
maloney's
sex?
you
keep
saying
he
or
she,
but
i
think
he--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
levy.
ms.
preiner,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
a
bench
trial
or
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
were
to
go
as
far
as...
your
opposing
counsel
says
that
an
attorney
was
appointed
for
this
person
who
would
agree
to
a
triple
capital
trial
within
a
month,
when
in
fact
he
should
have
wanted
a
much
longer
time
to
prepare.
i
mean,
you
say
that's
raised
for
the
first
time
now,
and
you
may
well
be
right,
but
if
that
were
somehow
made
out
at
the
appropriate
point,
that
would
surely
be
a
basis
of
discovery
for
that
attorney,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
preiner.
mr.
levy,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
mr.
levy,
could
you
comment
on
the
observation
that
the
timing
of
the
trial,
the
early
setting,
is
the
first
time,
and
your
description
of
that,
the
first
time
that
this
has
come
up
is
in...
here
in
this
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
