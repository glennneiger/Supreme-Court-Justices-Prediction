mr.
levy,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
scope
of
your
concession
was.
did
you,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice,
acknowledge
that
before
you
can
proceed
with
further
discovery
you
must
establish
a
probability
of
unfairness?
justice
antonin
scalia
substantive
standard
for
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
ultimate
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
ultimate
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
levy,
let's
get
back
to
the
precise
issue
that
you
have
to
establish.
you
have
to
show
that
you
may
be
able
to
prove
a
probability
of
bias.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
may
be
able
to
prove
probability.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
rests
upon
several
assumptions
that
i
don't
think
are
necessarily
self-evident,
number
1
that
a
judge
who
takes
bribes
in
order
to
provide
lenient
treatment
to
some
criminal
defendants
will
provide
harsher
treatment
to
those
from
whom
he
does
not
take
bribes.
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
self-evident.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
i...
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
just
the
opposite,
that
a
judge
who
is
on
the
take
in
some
cases
would
look
worse
and
would
perhaps
seem
to
be
taking
bribes
if
he
were,
you
know,
a
hanging
judge
in
most
cases
but
in
some
cases
all
of
a
sudden
comes
out
with,
you
know,
real
bleeding
heart
rulings.
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
a
more
plausible
assumption
of
human
behavior
than
the
one
you
want
us
to
believe.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
should
get
discovery
if
this
man
were
cheating
on
his
wife,
for
example?
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
close
connection
between
the
dishonesty
in
question
and
the
dishonesty
that
you
claim
disfavored
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
levy,
isn't
your
answer--
--it
seems
to
me
that
he's
likely
to...
the
fact
that
he
is
dishonest
when
he's
given
money
does
not
seem
to
me
to
render
it
self-evident
that
he's
going
to
be
dishonest
when
he's
not
given
money.
mr.
levy,
isn't
your...
a
point
you're
overlooking
is,
he
has
to
get
himself
reelected,
and
if
he's
a
bleeding
heart
in
every
case
he's
not
going
to
be
reelected
in
cook
county.
[laughter]
wasn't
it
part
of
this
record
that
this
judge
did
have
a
reputation
for
being
tough
on
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
the--
--i,
my
point
is
exact...
if
i
were
taking
a
bribe,
i
would
be
very
careful
not
to
be
a
hanging
judge
in
90
percent
of
the
cases
and
all
of
a
sudden
come
up
with
this
utterly
inexplicable
bleeding
heart
ruling.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
call
more
attention
to
me
than
the
opposite.
i--
--is
that
what
you're
going
to
do
discovery
to
find
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
suppose
you
haven't
had
a
trial,
in
the
ordinary
sense,
if
it's
been
done
before
a
kangaroo
court.
there's
just
been
no
trial
in
the
accepted
sense,
and
the
question
of
whether
you
had
a
fair
trial
is
different
from
the
question
of
whether
you
had
a
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
hadn't
a
bribe
been
invited
or
solicited
in
that
case?
i
thought
that
was
part
of
the
scenario.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
lawyer
had
previously
come
up
with
bribes.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
preiner,
i'm...
the
brief
that
was
referred
to
signed
by
former
prosecutors,
these
people
are
former
prosecutors?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
practice
criminal
law
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
usually
on
behalf
of
defendants.
