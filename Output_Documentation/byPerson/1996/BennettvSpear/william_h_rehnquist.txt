chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
95-813,
brad
bennett
v.
michael
spear.
mr.
wilkinson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
talking
about
the
granting
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
here,
aren't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
we're
talking
about
the...
how
you
construe
allegations
in
a
complaint
basically.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
isn't
it
a
general
rule
too
that
in...
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
you
interpret
the
allegations
of
a
complaint
to
support
a
cause
of
action,
if
there's
any
ambiguity
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes,
for
purposes
of
deciding
any
legal
question
raised
by
the
motion
to
dismiss.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wilkinson.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
kneedler,
there
are
two
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
one
is
whether
the
standing
under
the
citizen
suit
provision
of
the
esa
has
a
zone
of
interest
test,
and
if
it
does,
is
it
a
one-sided
test.
i
wasn't
able
to
tell
from
the
government's
brief
what
the
government's
response
was
to
either
of
those
questions.
i
hope
you'll
tell
us
during
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
citizen
suits
generally
depart
from
the
traditional
rules,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
are
saying
it's
just
like
an
environmental
impact
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
the
agency
must
get
it
before
it
acts,
but
it
may
totally
ignore
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
make
any
sense?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
don't
have
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
wilkinson,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wilkinson.
the
case
is
submitted.
