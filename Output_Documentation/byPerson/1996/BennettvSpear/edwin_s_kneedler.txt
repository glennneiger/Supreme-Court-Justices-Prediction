mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
let
me
answer
that
from
the
outset.
the
zone
of
interest
test
or
formulation,
as
this
court
said
in
the
clarke
decision,
is
ultimately
traceable
as
a
gloss
on
the
administrative
procedure
act
when
there...
for
determining
when
there's
a
cause
of
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
at
least
that's
where
it
originated.
so,
it's
ultimately
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
in
our
view
the
proper
approach
to
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
the
endangered
species
act
citizen
suit
provision
in
this
case
is
also
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
not
by
reference
to
unanchored
questions
of
zone
of
interest,
but
by
reference
to
the
specific
text
of
the
citizen
suit
provision
that
we
have
at
issue
here.
and
as
to
that,
we
say
that
there
is...
the
only
cognizable
claims
under
the
citizen
suit
provisions
are
things
for
violations
of
the
act,
and
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
violations
of
the
act
refer
to
on-the-ground
activities
that
could
be
engaged
in
by
a
private
person
or
by
a
federal
agency
with
on-the-ground
responsibilities
equally.
in
other
words,
the
citizen
suit
provision
for
actions
against
any
person,
including
the
united
states,
includes
situations
in
which
the
united
states,
like
any
person,
might
be
taking
on-the-ground
activities
that
would
adversely
affect
a
species.
in
our
view
it
does
not
provide
an
avenue
for
judicial
review
of
ordinary
administrative
action
of
a
regulatory
nature.
it
provides
for
a
citizen
suit
against
those
who
are
regulated,
not
the
agency
that
is
regulating.
the
apa--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
that
would
be
a
suit
under
the
apa.
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
no.
in
fact,
the
final
subsection
of
the
endangered
species
citizen
suit
provision
here
preserves
other
causes
of
action.
so,
let
me
be
clear.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
violations
are
categorized
as
things
that
harm
the
species.
that's
consistent
with
citizen
suit
provisions
generally.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes.
i
mean,
there
are
two...
the
government
when
it
is...
if
the
government
is
operating
a
reclamation
project
or
building
a
dam
that
may
harm
a
species,
in
that
situation
it
is
analogous
to
a
private
party
who
may
also
be
engaged
in
on-the-ground
activities.
if
it...
when
the
government
is
operating
as
regulator,
then
we
think
the
apa
is
the
normal
cause
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
would
bring
a
suit
against
the
action
agency,
not
against
the
fish
and
wildlife
service,
and
they
would
have
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
no.
in
that
situation
the
suit
could
be
brought
against
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
but
let
me
just
clarify--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
would
name
who
was
ever
responsible
for
operating
the
project
on
the
ground,
not
whoever
gave
the
advice.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
in
our
view
in
this
situation
it
would
be
brought
under
the
apa.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
again
in
our
view
the
citizen
suit
provision
of
the
endangered
species
act
like
citizen
suit...
other
citizen
suit
provisions
are
designed
to
allow
private
persons
or
the
government
as
the
plaintiff
to
sue
whoever
might
be
causing
pollution
or
harming
a
species.
that
is
the
origin
of
the
citizen
suit
provision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
the
word
violation
because
the
word
violation
in
our
view
and
enforcing
the
act,
which
is
another
word
that
the
citizen
suit
provision
uses,
suggests
law
enforcement
against
people
who
are
taking
actions--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--justice
o'connor,
there
are
a
number
of
provisions...
a
number
of
aspects
of
the
citizen
suit
provision
which
we
think
cut
strongly
the
other
way.
if
i
may.
subparagraphs
(b)
and
(c)
specifically...
on
page
2a----
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--beginning
on
page
2a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
the
entire
citizen
suit
provision
set
out.
section
7(a)(2)
which
imposes
duties
on
action
agencies
is
on
the
preceding
page.
seven...
the
citizen
suit
provision
on
page
2a
in
paragraph
(a)
says,
provides
for
a
suit
to
enjoin
any
person,
including
the
united
states
or
a
governmental
agency.
paragraphs
(b)
and
(c)
talk
about
suits
against
the
secretary.
(b)
and
(c)
are
both
for
actions
against
the
secretary
in
his
administrative
responsibilities
under
the
act.
the
first
one
were
some
interim
provisions
in
paragraph
(b),
and
in
paragraph
(c)
the
only
provision
of
the
citizen
suit
provision
that
refers
to
section
4
of
the
act
does
it
in
a
very
precise
way
against
the
secretary
where
there's
alleged
failure
to
perform
a
mandatory
duty
under
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
(b)
was
in
the
original
act
and
referred
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
redundancy.
it's
a
question
that
congress
used
different--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it's
not
just
the
redundancy
that...
let
me
make
several
other
points,
if
i
may.
it's
the
fact
that
congress
used
different
terminology.
when
it
was
referring
to
the
person
who
might
be
committing
on-the-ground
violations
just
like
the
private
person,
it
used
the
word
agency
or
united
states.
when
it
was
referring
to
the
secretary
acting
in
his
regulatory
capacity,
it
used
the
word
secretary.
and
back
on
page
1a
where...
which
is
the
operative
provision
that
the
petitioners
say
was
violated
here,
it
says
that
each
federal
agency
shall
in
consultation
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
secretary
make
sure
that
its
actions
don't
cause
jeopardy.
so,
even
in
that
section
as
well,
the
congress
distinguished
between
agencies
that
take
on-the-ground
activities
and
their
duty
to
avoid
jeopardy.
and
this
duty
is
imposed
on
the
action
agency,
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
in
itself.
i
mean,
what
would...
if
the
operating
agency,
even
in
that
situation,
thought
that
some
aspect
of
its
operation
might
affect
the
species,
it
is
supposed
to
trigger...
it
is
supposed
to
request
consultation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
that
situation
there
might
well
be
an
action
under
the
apa,
706,
paragraph
1.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
there
would
not
be,
no,
again
for
the
reason
that
that...
first
of
all,
that's
not
final
agency
action,
and
it's
part
of
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
the
secretary's
administration
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe
there
would
not
be
a
cause
of
action
under
the
citizen
suit
provision
for
that
because,
again,
that
goes
to
the
administration
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's
not
a
violation
that's
enforceable
under
the
citizen
suit
provision.
i
mean,
there
may
be
a
failure
to
perform
a...
an
obligation
that
the
secretary
has,
but
again
paragraph
(c)
of
the
citizen
suit
provision
provides
for
suits
against
the
secretary
to
compel
him
to
perform
mandatory
duties
only
in
specific
circumstances
under
section
4
of
the
act
where
there
are
certain
time
limitations
and
listing
determinations,
but
the
sort
of...
we
think
the
clear
implication
of
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
well,
we're
not
saying
there's
no
suit.
again,
the
apa
would
provide...
where
it's
a
question
of
administering
the
act,
the
apa
is
the
usual
way
in
which
a
plaintiff
challenges
a
regulatory
agency's
administration
of
the
act--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
my
only
point
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiffs
would
be
left
remedyless.
and
our
entire
submission
in
this
case
is
not
to
try
to
keep
resource
users
out
of
court.
we
think...
we
do,
however,
think
it's
important
to
have
an
orderly
process
about
how
such
suits
are
brought.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
the
zone
of
interest,
we
would
answer
it
differently
in
the
sense
that
we
would
not
use
the
phrase,
zone
of
interest.
we
agree
with
its
conclusion
on
the
ground
that
the
citizen
suit
provision
itself
is
narrowed
to...
is
confined
to
situations
where
there...
where
what
the
defendant
is
doing
would
be
harming
the
species.
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
by
reference
to
generalized
zone
of
interest.
it
answers
the
question
in
terms
of
what's
a
violation
that
is
cognizable
under
the
act.
and,
i
mean,
that
is
our
central
submission
in
this
case.
and
it...
one
related
point--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not...
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
with
all
respect,
i
think
one-way
is
an
unfair
characterization.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
one-way
in
the
sense
that,
yes,
the
citizen
suit
is
designed
to
advance
the
purposes
of
species
protection
just
like
this
court
in
gwaltney
says--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
let
me
also
say
if...
even
if
the
citizen
suit
provision
were
applicable
to
administration
of
the
act
rather
than
on-the-ground
activities,
we
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
congress
in
that
situation
to
have
departed
from
the
normal
rules
for
judicial
review
of
agency
action
and
specifically
the
final
agency
action
point.
and
this
ties--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
they
do
in
a
sense,
but
that
can
be
overstated.
for
example,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
specifically
endorse
the
proposition
that
this
court
stated
in
the
seaclammers
case,
that
the
citizen
suit
provision
of
the
clean
water
act,
which
is
the
foundation
for
this
citizen
suit
provision,
was
designed
to
allow
a
right
of
action
where
that
would
be
true
under
sierra
club
v.
morton.
well,
in
fact,
the
sierra
club
v.
morton
was
a
suit
under
section
10
of
the
apa.
it
specifically
discussed
the
zone
of
interest
test
and
said
that
the
plaintiffs
there,
even
though
they're
environmental...
even
though
they
were
environmental
interests
being
advanced,
were
within
that
zone
of
interest.
it
was
not
a
repudiation
of
the
zone
of
interest
test
but
an
application
of
it.
so,
when
you
have
this
citizen
suit
provision
building
on
sierra
club
v.
morton,
its
principal
thrust
was
that
environmental
interests
are
a
sufficient
basis
for
bringing
a
suit.
but
there's
no...
particularly
against
that
background,
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
citizen
suit
provision,
even
if
it
were
applicable
to
suits
against
agencies
and
their
administration
of
the
act,
was
intended
to
depart
from--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
it
addresses...
and
again,
it's
not
designed
for...
it's
not...
it
may
allow
broader
standing
where
it
applies,
but
it
has
a
narrow
application
and
the
application
is
very
much
consistent
with--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
can.
and
it
was
addressing
a
harm
that
any
person,
including
the
united
states,
might
engage
in
not
the
special
expertise--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
point
that
ties
in
here.
the
petitioners
in
their
reply
brief
had
suggested
that
this
court
resolve
the
article
iii
standing
question,
and
we
argued
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
causation
and
redressability
for
much
the
same
reason
we've
talked
about,
that
they
sued
the
wrong
agency,
sued
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
for
its
advice
rather
than
the
bureau
of
reclamation
for
what
it
actually
did.
that
ties
directly
into
our
final
agency
action
point.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
our
point
is
not
one
of
fact.
it's
one
of
law,
and
it
ties
directly
into
our
final
agency
action
point.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
it's
a
mixed
question.
in
the
opinion
for
the
plurality
in
lujan
v.
defenders
of
wildlife
where
redressability
was
discussed,
the
four-justice
plurality
in
that
part
of
the
opinion
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
action
taken
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
in
interpreting
the
regulation
or
stating
when
consultation
was
necessary
was
not
binding
on
the
other
agency,
the
action
agency.
and
for
that
reason,
there
was
an
absence
of
redressability.
and
that
was
not
a
factual
question
in
our
view.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
let...
if
i
may
make
the
other
half
of
the
argument
i'm
making
is
the
problems
with
that,
exactly
how
close
a
connection
there
has
to
be,
are
completely
taken
care
of
if
the
court
simply
adheres
to
the
normal
final
agency
action
rule.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
a
practical
matter,
there
may
well
be.
that's
not
our--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
not.
i
think
where
there
is
an
intervening
action
by
a
third
party,
as
there
was
in
simon
v.
eastern
kentucky
welfare
or
in
this
court's
decision
in
franklin
where
there's
intervening
action
by
the
president,
it's
not
sufficient.
in
fact,
in
franklin
there
had
never
been
an
instance
in
which
the
president
had
failed
to
follow
the
recommendation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--on
the...
only
on
the
constitutional
question,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
exactly
correct.
for...
to
use
another
example
in
the
internal
operations
of
the
government,
if
the
secretary
of
another
department
asks
the
attorney
general
for
a
legal
opinion
and
the
attorney
general
writes
a
legal
opinion,
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
almost
invariably,
if
not
invariably,
the
other
agency
would
follow
it.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
suit
would
lie
against
the
attorney
general.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
absolutely,
in
the
suit
against
the
action
agency.
the
advice...
the
recommendation
becomes
part
of
the
record
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
acts
upon,
but
at
that
point
it
doesn't
make
the
recommendation
final
agency
action.
the
recommendation
remains
a
recommendation
and
gets
acted
upon,
along
with
whatever
else
the
bureau
of
reclamation
may
have
in
its
files
that
would
influence
the
way
in
which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
okay.
there
are
two
situations
in
which
you
might
sue
the
action
agency.
if
the
action
agency
is...
if
the
bureau
of
reclamation
reduced
the
water
and
it
might
have
harmed
the
species,
there's
unquestionably
a
cause
of
action
under
the
citizen
suit
provision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
the
water
is
raised,
there's
no
general
proposition
in
the
endangered
species
act
that
requires
the
action
agency
to
take
only
the
minimum
amount
of
action
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
endangered
species.
it
could,
not
just
for
endangered
species
concerns
or
because
it
wanted
to
add...
have
an
extra
layer
of
caution--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
background
of
that
provision
when
it
was
enacted
in
'79
indicates
that
that
was
put
in
there
so
that
the
agency
would
not
feel
it
had
to
hold
up
doing
anything
at
all
until
it
had
perfect
information.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
exactly
right.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
may
have
other
evidence--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
sense
of
the
act
is
that
the...
and
experience
shows
that
the
action
agency
relies
upon
the
biological
opinion.
most
action--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
don't,
and
that's
our
point.
they
don't
legally
have
to.
and
in
fact,
they
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
have
to
get
one.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
the
action
agency
simply
has
to
consult.
the
duty
to
prepare
a
comprehensive
biological
opinion
is
a
duty
owed
by
the
consulting
agency
to
the
action
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
that's...
when
you
have
a
question
of
internal
deliberations
between
two
government
agencies
and
a
statute
that
tells
an
agency,
before
you
take
certain
action,
talk
to
the
attorney
general,
it
would
be
odd
to
say
you
can
sue
the
attorney
general
because
of
the
advice
that
he
gave
to
the
action
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
alleges
that
the
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
that's
the
standard
under
the
apa
or
the
esa.
the
same
substantive
standard
of
review
applies.
he
would
say
that
the
decision
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
it
was
not
adequately
supported
by
the
administrative
record.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
no
private
person.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
believe
that's
correct,
but
what...
the
way...
let
me
retreat
from
that
just
to
this
extent.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
would
be
done
is
that
the
plaintiff
would
sue
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
said...
and
say,
you
proceeded
without
an
adequate
basis.
and
if
the
allegation
was
you
proceeded
with
a
report
that
was...
that
didn't
rise
to
the
minimum
necessary
to
be
a
biological
opinion
under
section
7,
you
have
to
set
aside
your
agency
action
and
you,
bureau
of
reclamation,
can't
proceed
unless
you
get
a
more
complete
biological
opinion.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
exactly
right,
but
the
suit
is
not
directly
against
the
fish
and
wildlife
service.
it's
still
always
a
suit
set
aside--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
but
the
secretary
was
only
sued
in
his
capacity
to...
as
the
person
making
jeopardy
determinations.
he
was
not
sued
in
his
capacity
in
running
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
and
the
relief
sought
was
to
withdraw
the
biological
opinion,
not
to
have
the
secretary
take
other
action
with
respect
to
the
raising
or
lowering
of
water.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
technically
what
you
would
get
is
a
judgment
saying
you
can't
go
forward
with
the
action
unless
you
get
an
adequate
biological
opinion.
it
would
be
full
and
complete
relief
because
the
secretary
would
have
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
something
else.
but
i'd
like
to
tie
our
position
too
into
something
justice
kennedy
was
asking
about,
the
interrelationship
of
the
water
situation
in
the
area
to
the
endangered
species
act
concerns.
there
can
also
be
questions
of
the
contract
rights
that
these
plaintiffs
have.
all
of
that
ties
into
the
standing
question.
all
of
that
ties
into
the
substantive
right
of
what
contract
rights
they
have,
what
bureau
of
reclamation
statutes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
that
situation
we
think
you
still
have
to
be
alleging
a
concrete
injury
to
yourself
and
you
have
to
be
alleging
that
the...
it
at
least
has
to
be
true
that
if
you...
in
the
sort
of
suit
i
was
describing
to
justice
scalia,
if
you
set
aside
the
agency
action,
to
have
the
procedural
measure
taken.
that
would
be
adequate
article
iii
standing.
we're
not
suggesting
to
the
contrary.
our
point
here
has
been
on
causation
and
redressability.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
zone
of
interest?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
may
be,
but
again
we
think
in
this
situation
if
they're
claiming
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
is
not
giving
them
enough
water,
that
arises
directly
under
the
reclamation
laws
and
their
contracts.
and
they
can
say
that...
when
the
bureau
says
our
defense
is
the
biological
opinion
and
other
information
we
have,
then
they
could
say,
well,
that's
not
an
adequate
biological
report
because
it
doesn't
have
the
best
scientific
evidence
in
it.
so,
we're
not
saying
that
they
can't
make
arguments
about
scientific
adequacy.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
it
is
always
i
think
necessary--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
the
eis
situation,
for
example,
the
harm
is
redressed
if
the
dam
is
going
forward
and
your
claim
is
there's
an
inadequate--
