justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wilkinson,
jurisdictional
issues
are
always
properly
before
us.
i
mean,
if
there
is
no
standing,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
we
can
surely
reach
the
article
iii
issue
if
we
want
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
we
agree
with
you
on
the
prudential
issues,
would
you
want
us
to
resolve
the
article
iii
issue
or
remand
to
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
can
be
contested
later
in
more
detail
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
and
at
the
merits
stage,
even
more
evidence
can
be
brought
in
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
that
at
the
pleading
level,
you've
done
all
that's
needed
at
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
allege
that
the
secretary
accepted
the
opinion
and
was
proceeding
in
accordance
with
the
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
in
your
complaint?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
haven't
sued
the
bureau.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
in
his
question
is
the
fact
that
you
have
sued
the
wrong
party.
the
party
you
have
sued
has
not
taken
final
agency...
the
final
agency
action
which
would
affect
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
remedy
you
seek?
do
you
seek
to
get
more
water
which
would
be
the
remedy
that
pertains
to
the
final
action
in
question,
or
do
you
seek
to
get
a
revised
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
not
a
remedy
that
will
do
you
any
good
because
the
secretary
can
look
at
the
revised
report
and
say,
i
like
the
other
one
better.
throw
away
the
revised
report
and
come
out
with
the
same
decision
that
you're
complaining
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what?
which
is
simply
that
he
consider
the
report,
but...
that
he
consider
the
new
report.
but
he's
fully...
he's
free
to
reject
it,
isn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if
that
were
true,
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
provide
for
a
suit
against
government
action,
action
that
couldn't
be
taken
by
private
individuals--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
can
be
taken
by
government
so
long
as
the
individual
is
within
the
zone
of
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
statute
requires
economic
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account,
a
person
who
would
be
favored
by
taking
them
into
account
is
certainly
within
the
zone
of
interests.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
not
eliminated
by
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you're
saying
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act
only
operate
one
way,
but
the
procedural
provisions
of
the
act,
those
that
limit
the
types
of
action
that
the
government
can
take,
those
provisions
are
subject
to
the
apa.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
one-way.
and
congress
can
write
a
one-way
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
wants,
i
presume.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
position
is
that
the
citizen
suit
provision
just
changes
that
one
aspect
of
the
apa
which
deals
with
zone
of
interests
and
only
as
to
certain
people,
namely,
those
who
are
complaining
about
environmental
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
apa
contains
a
provision,
doesn't
it,
although
i
think
it's
rarely
cited,
that
it
shall
not
be
superseded
except...
unless
explicitly.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
all
of
the
other
provisions
would
certainly
continue
to
apply,
at
least
where
there's
no
direct
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
claimed
in
their
complaint
that
there
was
causality,
and
this
was
dismissed
without
any
further
investigation.
they
said
that
there
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
upon
information
and
belief,
they
said
that
he
would
follow
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
that.
causality
is
a
question
of
fact,
not
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
was
no
allegation
in
that
complaint.
i
don't
even
remember
whether
lujan
came
up
at
the
pleading
stage.
it
was
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
rather
than
pleading?
which
is
quite
different.
and
there
was
no
allegation
in
lujan
that
there
was
this
causality,
that
the
agency
had
determined
to
follow
this
report.
that
would
have
made
it
a
totally
different
ball
game.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
still
not
certain--
--suppose
the
agency
has
taken
the
action,
as
is
alleged
here.
it
is
alleged
that
the
agency
is
proceeding
according
to
this
report.
once
it
has,
is
it
not
proper
to
question
under
the
apa
the
adequacy
of
the
factual
bases
on
which
the
agency
took
that
action,
including
in
this
case
the
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
like
the
epa.
even
though
you
get
a
wonderful
environmental
report,
the
agency
isn't
bound
by
the
conclusion
of
that
report
so
long
as
it
has
been
done
properly.
it's
free
to
proceed
on
its
best
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
that's
the
same
with
this
biological
report
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
have
to
get
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
to
get
a
good
one
just
as
an
agency
has
to
get
an
environmental
impact
statement,
and
if
it
hasn't
gotten
a
good
one,
if
it
has
gotten
one
that's
been
done
on
the
cheap
or
one
that's
a
sham,
they're
in
violation
of
the
act.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that's
the
fish
and
wildlife
service,
and
that's
the
one
agency
you
say
that
can't
be
sued.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
no
way
anybody
can
get
an
accurate
biological
report.
nobody
can
compel
this
agency
to
give
an
adequate
biological
report
is
what
you're
saying.
nobody.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
private
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
the
secretary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
you
will.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
the
way
it
works
with
an
environmental
impact
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
one
isn't
either.
this
one
isn't
either.
i
mean,
this
one
is
against
the
secretary,
which
includes
everybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
withdrawing
the
biological
opinion
is
indeed
relief
that
can
be
sought.
if
you
say
you
proceeded
without
an
adequate
biological
opinion,
you
say
you
can
get
a
judgment
requiring
the
secretary
to
get
a
proper
biological
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
the
archaic
procedure
that's
used
everywhere
else
in
the
government.
right?
[laughter]
except
in
this
one
statute.
