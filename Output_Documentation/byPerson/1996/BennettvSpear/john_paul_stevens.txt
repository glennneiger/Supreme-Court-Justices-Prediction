justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
just
recited
some
facts
that
are
not
included
in
your
pleading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
you
want...
it
just
seems
to
me
if
you
want
the
issue
decided
on
the
complaint
as
it
now
stands,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
tell
us
facts
that
are
not
in
those
things
you
say
should
be
dispositive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
government
points
out
there's
no
allegation
that
you're
going
to
even
lose
a
gallon
of
water.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
theoretically
under
your
pleading,
all
the
harm
could
be
suffered
by
other
water
users.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
interrupt?
because
i'm
still
interested
in
the
answer
to
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
at
the
very
beginning
about
the
questions
presented
in
the...
in
this
case.
and
as
i
understand
your
argument...
i
may
be
wrong...
you
would
answer
both
of
the
questions
presented
by
the
petition
differently
than
the
ninth
circuit
did.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
endorse
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
a
one-way...
it's
slightly
differently
articulated,
but
it's
also
a
one-way
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
also,
mr.
kneedler,
has
very
specific
protections
for
the
resource
user.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
just
read
that
out
of
the
act
and
remit
them
to
their
remedies
under
the
apa
where,
i
tend
to
agree
with
you,
there
may
not
be
final
action
under
the
apa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
the
citizen
suit...
just
to
oversimplify
a
little
bit,
you're
saying
the
citizen
suit
provision
is
a
narrower
remedy
than
the
remedy
under
the
apa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
just
as
a
proposition
of
administrative
law,
and
i
guess
it
would
be
under
either
the
apa
or
the
endangered
species
act.
suppose
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
gets
the
biological
report
from
the
fish
and
wildlife
service.
could
it
not
say
that
we're
not
sure
that
it
took
into
account
the
best
scientific
evidence,
but
we
think
it's
reasonably
close,
and
in
our
best
judgment
it's
an
adequate
report?
can
it
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
says
that,
then
if
an
aggrieved
person
under
the
apa
feels
that
the
act...
feels
that
the
report
is
inadequate,
does
he
sue
the
bureau
of
reclamation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
does
he
allege?
