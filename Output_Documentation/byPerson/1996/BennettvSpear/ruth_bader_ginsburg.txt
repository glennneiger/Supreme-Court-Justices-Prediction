justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wilkinson,
could
you
just
clarify
what
you
mean
by
comply?
you
said
the
secretary
has
complied.
has
he
made
an
adjustment
in
the
water
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
say
the
ripeness
question
is
something
that
needs
to
be
aired
in
a
court
of
first
instance,
but
that
you
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wilkinson,
may
i--
--suppose
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
said
we
have
had
a
3-year
drought
in
the
pacific
northwest
and
we're
not
going
to
be
making
any
releases
from
the
clear
lake
gerber
reservoir
even
if
we
have
abundant
rainfall
for
2
more
years.
would
you
then
have
standing?
and
your
injury
is
for
the
next
2
years
let's
say.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wilkinson.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
wedded
are
you
to
attacking
the
fish
and
wildlife
report
per
se?
in
other
words,
you
were
cut
off
at
the
pass
essentially,
and
when
i
heard
the
question
about
why
didn't
you
sue
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
well,
that's
an
eminently
fixable
lack,
if
it
is
a
lack
at
all.
and
similarly,
you
could
amend
your
complaint
to
say,
yes,
we're
getting
at
the
report
through
the
acceptance
of
it
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
so,
i'm
trying
to
determine
whether
we're
just
dealing
with
a
pleading
that
may
not
be
appropriate
and
could
be
amended
or
whether
there's
some
reason
why
you
must
zero
in
directly
on
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
report
rather
than
reach
it
through
the
bureau
of
reclamation
acceptance
of
it.
