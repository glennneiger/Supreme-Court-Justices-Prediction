justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wilkinson,
i
think
i
understand
your
probability
argument.
let
me
just
carry
the
redressability
point
one
step
further.
assume
that
in
fact
there
were
a
determination
that
the
report
was
as
defective
as
you
say
and
therefore
would
not
be
a
proper
basis
for
the
secretary's
action
as
the
ultimate
official
responsible
for
bor.
is
there
any
reason
in
law
why
the
secretary
could
not
at
that
point
say
simply,
not
that
i'm
worried
about
unusual
drought
conditions?
i'm
simply
worried
about
the
fish,
and
common
sense
tells
me
that
having
more
water
in
the
reservoirs
is
going
to
be
better
for
the
fish
and
be
far
less
likely
to
lead
to
their
extinction
than
less
water
in
the
reservoirs.
so,
report
or
no
report,
for
purposes
of
protecting
the
fish,
i'm
simply
going
to
keep
the
water
level
up
and
do
exactly
what
i've
done
before.
is
there
any
legal
reason...
or
exactly
what
the
bor
has
done
before.
is
there
any
legal
reason
that
the
secretary
could
not
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
you
would
have
a
separate
action
in
that
case
i
understand
against
the
secretary,
but
the...
would
the
secretary
be
violating...
perhaps
i
should
have...
should
rephrase
my
question.
would
the
secretary
be
violating
any
procedural
norm
other
than
needing
a
scientific
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
he
have
to
have
a
biological
opinion?
in
other
words,
does
he
have
to
make
this
reference
to
the
fish
and
wildlife
service?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
the
consultation
required?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
he
have
an
option
not
to
consult
in
these
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
let's
assume
he
doesn't
seek
it
and
he
simply
says,
i
don't
need
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
to
tell
me
that
more
water
is
better
for
the
fish.
would
he
be
violating
any
procedural
norm
of
the
act
except,
as
you
say,
for
failing
to
have
a
more
systematically
justified
basis
for
his
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
goes
to
redressability.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're
saying
that
this
is
an
endangered
species
act
suit
and
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
reference
in
effect
sets
the
stage
for
what
redressability
means
in
this
circumstance.
and
given
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
reference,
there
has
been
a
report,
necessarily
if
the
report,
in
effect,
is
required
to
be
withdrawn,
you
will
get
relief.
the
secretary
may
turn
around
tomorrow
morning
and
do
something
else
that
you
don't
like--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you'll
get
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
have
an
act
in
which
redundancy
clearly
is
not
a
sin,
and
your
argument
basically
is
a
redundancy
kind
of
argument.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
should
accept
the
redundancy
premise
as
appropriate.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
redundancy
plus
violation,
but
i
mean,
your...
one
of
your
arguments
is
that
on
justice
o'connor's
suggested
reading,
you
wouldn't
need
(c)
there.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
an
act
in
which
redundancy
doesn't
cut
much.
