justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
that's
bothering
me...
maybe
i'll
set
it
all
out...
is
that
suppose
i
think
this
isn't
ripe,
this
case.
that's
the
problem.
it
isn't
ripe.
there
was
a
report
that
you
say
was
not
properly
prepared.
the
report
was
to
go
to
the
secretary.
when
the
secretary
gets
it,
he
might
act,
he
might
not
act.
if
the
secretary
in
fact
says
the
levels
of
the
lake
should
be
higher,
your
clients
are
hurt.
if
the
secretary
says
they
shouldn't
be
higher
and
ignores
the
report
or
whatever,
your
clients
suffered
no
harm.
so,
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
this
isn't
final
agency
action.
well,
when
it
is
final
and
your
client
is
hurt,
you
have
a
case
and
you
bring
it.
how
can
i
decide
in
the
abstract
whether
you
have
standing
or
not
have
standing
without
knowing
what
the
secretary
is
going
to
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
without
knowing
what
your
basis
for
attacking
the
secretary's
action
is?
i
assume
it
would
be
the
secretary
said
the
level
of
the
lake
should
be
higher.
that
hurts
our
client.
he
based
that
on
a
decision
of
the
wildlife
service
or
whatever
and
that
decision
is
no
good
for
the
very
reasons
you're
saying
now.
but
how
can
i
decide
the
standing
question
abstractly
without
knowing
what
your
final
claim
would
be
when
your
clients
are
really
about
to
be
hurt
because
the
secretary
says
the
lake
level
has
to
stay
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
basic
thing
would
be
that,
look,
the
apa...
and
i
say
the
statute
is
similar...
says
that
you
can
sue
to
complain
about
final
agency
action,
and
the
final
agency
action
in
this
instance,
arguably,
is
not
the
action
of
the
fish
and
wildlife
service,
but
rather
the
action,
let's
say,
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
and
whether
you
put
this
sentence
in
the
complaint
or
didn't
put
it
in
the
complaint,
you
are
not
suing
to
claim
that
the
action
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
is
unlawful.
what
you
are
suing
to
complain
about
is
that
the
action
of
the
report
sending
is
unlawful.
and
therefore,
i
wondered
if
it
is
ripe
in
the
sense
that
your
complaint
does
not
attack
the
final
agency
action,
namely,
the
action
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
which
would
lower
or
raise
or
do
something
with
the
water.
that
was...
and
i
wondered
how
i
could
go
at
the
standing
question
if
i
believed
the
hypothetical
because
standing
would
depend
on
what
your
argument
is
in
respect
to
the
final
agency
action
which
you
would
attack
which
this
complaint
seems
not
to
attack.
that
was--
--before
you
answer
that,
would
you
incorporate
please--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
very
interesting
answer,
and
really
you're
saying
that
these
reports
are
like
environmental
impact
statements
because
environmental
impact
statements
are
preliminary
to
final
agency
action,
but
they
are
final
because
of
the
intent
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
which
is
to
stop
the
machinery.
the
problem
with
that
answer
is
that
all
this
hasn't
been
argued
at
all
because
at
first
blush
it
doesn't
appear
that
they're
the
same
as
environmental
impact
statements
since
they
aren't
designed
to
stop
the
machinery
of
the
bureaucracy
from
gearing
up.
so,
i
find
that
an
interesting
and
important
response,
but
i
just
haven't
seen
it
fully
argued.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
in
the
sense
that
it's
final
by
itself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
understand.
suppose
that
they
brought
the
suit
the
way
i
was
suggesting
it
would
be
brought.
there
is
an
action
taken
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
to
keep
the
lake
level
up.
that
deprives
my
clients
of
x
million
square
feet
of
water
which
they
have
a
contract
for
and
would
otherwise
get.
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
that
it
is
illegal,
says
the
plaintiff,
is
because
they
received
a
report
that
was
not
prepared
as
the
statute
requires;
i.e.,
it
did
not
use
the
best
scientific
commercial
and...
scientific
and
commercial
data
available.
therefore,
it
violated
section
706
of
the
esa.
are
you
saying
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
pursue
such
a
suit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
that's
right.
they
would
bring
it
against
the
secretary,
this
time
saying
that
the
secretary's
action
in
keeping
up
the
lake
level
is
unlawful
for
the
reason
that
the
report
did
not
correspond
with
what
the
statute
requires.
now,
are
you
saying
that
that
suit
could
not
be
brought
for
some
reason
of
standing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
would
name
the
secretary.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that
part.
the
part
that
i'm
finding
difficult
to
follow
is
let's
imagine
my
suit.
i
sue
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
that's
the
ground
agency.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
i
sue
them
is
because
they
issued
an
order
to
keep
the
water
up.
that's
a
final
action.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
allege
in
my
endangered
species
act
complaint
as
a
person
who
is
asking
for
an
injunction
or
the
setting
aside
of
this
final
agency
order
by
another
government
person.
the
judge
says,
why
is
it
illegal?
and
i
say,
the
reason
that
it's
illegal
is
because
it
didn't
comply
with
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
esa
because
it
did
not
rest
upon
the,
quote,
best
scientific
and
commercial
data
available.
now,
there.
i
have
standing.
i'm
hurt.
i'm
complaining
about
a
final
action,
and
i
have
a
reason
that
under
the
law
was
not
complied
with.
now,
are
you
saying
i
cannot
bring
that
action,
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
raised
the
water.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
they
put
in
those
words,
best
scientific
and
commercial
data?
because
they
could
have
said
raise
the
water
for
any
reason
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
word
arguably?
do
you
remember
the
word
arguably?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
data
processing.
right.
when
we
go
through
all
this,
isn't
it
at
least
arguable
that
that
scientific
data
provision
and
so
forth
covers...
isn't
their
claim
at
least
arguable
in
that
respect?
