mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
raises
the
question
whether
farmers
and
irrigation
districts
that
receive
water
pursuant
to
federal
contracts
have
standing
to
complain
when
their
water
supplies
are
cut,
their
crops
threatened,
and
their
land
devalued
as
a
consequence
of
government
conduct
alleged
to
violate
the
provisions
of
the
endangered
species
act.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
in
part,
that's...
yes,
absolutely
correct.
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
answer
to
the
question
i
posed
is
no
because
petitioners'
competitive,
economic-based
interest
in
the
water
places
them
outside
a
zone
of
interest
protected
by
the
esa.
we
believe
this
ruling
goes
well
beyond
the
bounds
of
any
standing
decision
of
this
court,
and
notably,
neither
the
government
nor
any
amicus
attempts
to
defend
it.
if
prudential
considerations
apply
at
all
to
actions
commenced
under
the
citizen
suit
provision
of
the
esa,
they
are
more
than
satisfied
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
their
water
supply
contracts
and
the
claims
they
alleged
in
their
complaint
place
them
well
within
any
zone
of
interest
either
protected
or
regulated
by
the
esa--
and
for
the
same
reason,
petitioners
also
have
a
right
to
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
since
they
are
persons
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
the
relevant
statute,
namely,
the
esa.
finally,
unless
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed,
we
believe
there
will
be
at
least
three
farreaching
and
negative
effects
from
it.
first,
there
will
exist
a
prudential
standing
scheme
under
the
esa
that
overtly
discriminates
against
economically
based
plaintiffs.
second,
because
the
courthouse
doors
will
be
closed
to
everyone
except
environmental
plaintiffs,
there
will
be
one-sided
enforcement
of
the
esa.
finally,
the
result
of
that
one-sided
enforcement
we
believe
will
be
skewed
implementation
of
the
act
that
continually
presses
the
government
forward
to
a
position
of
over-regulation
instead
of
the
balance
sought
by
congress
when
it
has
committed
the
act.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
justice
o'connor,
the
article
iii
arguments
were
raised
below.
however,
they
were
not
decided
by
either
of
the
courts
below.
the
cognizability
claims
in
our
view
were
never
raised
below,
nor
were
they
raised
in
the
cert
op.
and
accordingly,
in
our
view
rule--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--that's
correct,
yes.
and
consequently,
it
would
be
our
view
that
those
cognizability
issues
are
not
properly
before
you.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
the
apa
arguments
as
well
were
not
raised
below
in
our
view
by
the
government,
and
consequently
also
are
not
properly
before
you
today.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
oh,
justice
scalia,
yes,
i
believe
you
can.
i'm
not
intending
to
say
that
the
article
iii
issues
were
not
properly
raised.
i
believe
they
were
and
i
believe
the
government
preserved
those
issues.
there's
a
question,
however,
that
may
arise
as
to
which
do
you
get
to
first:
the
prudential
issues
or
the
article
iii
issues.
our
reading
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
that
while
preliminary
jurisdictional
questions
may
be
approached
first,
certainly
before
merits
issues
are
to
be
decided,
that
there's
no
decision
of
this
court
which
indicates
which
comes
first.
we
think
there
are
good
reasons
here
for
dealing
with
the
prudential
questions
before
you
reach
the
article
iii
questions.
those
were
the
issues
resolved
by
the
courts
below.
those
were
the
issues
that
were
the
subject
for
the...
of
the
petition
of
writ
of
certiorari
and
those
were
the
issues
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
in
addition,
those
are
the
issues,
the
prudential
issues,
that
have
split
the
courts
of
appeal,
and
as
i
think
we've
indicated
in
a
letter
to
the
court,
that
split
has
only
grown
since
cert
was
granted.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
would
prefer,
if
you
are
with
us
on
the
prudential
issues,
that
we
are
still
in
this
case,
that
you
go
forward
and
try
and
resolve
the
article
iii
issues.
i
think
that's
particularly
appropriate,
in
fact,
in
the
circumstances
in
this
case
because
it
does
arise
on
motions
to
dismiss.
and
according
to
lujan
v.
defenders
of
wildlife,
at
that
stage
of
the
case,
the
burden
for
a
petitioner
attempting
to
deal
with
article
iii
is
a
more
modest
one--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--we
don't
believe
that--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
fully
understand
the--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--actually
the
suit
below
was
brought
against
the
secretary.
it
was
named...
bruce
babbitt
was
named
as
a
defendant.
bruce
babbitt
is
also,
apart
from
being
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
cabinet
official
responsible
for
both
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
it
has
struck
us
as
somewhat
curious,
indeed,
that
the
united
states
would
challenge
article
iii
standing
on
the
basis
that
we
had
not
properly
joined
the
bureau.
we
had
sued
the
cabinet
official
responsible
for
the
bureau.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--let
me
deal
first
with
the
situation
that
exists
in
this
case,
and
then
i'll
deal
with
your
hypothetical.
your
hypothetical
is
not
this
case,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case
it
was
alleged
that
the
bureau
would
comply,
that
the
secretary
would
authorize
the
bureau
to
comply
with
the
biological
opinion.
and
in
its
merits
brief,
the
united
states
admits
that
the
bureau
indicated
that
it
would
comply.
in
fact,
it
has
complied.
so,
your
hypothetical
differs
from
this
case
in
the
sense
that
it
assumes
non-compliance
when
in
fact
there
is
compliance.
but
let
me
deal
with
the
hypothetical
straight
up.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
yes,
he
has,
justice
ginsburg.
he
has,
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
adjustment,
we
lost
80
percent
of
our
water
supply.
lands
were
fallowed.
people
lost
their
jobs.
the
value
of
property
fell
from
hundreds
of
dollars
per
acre
to
$20
per
acre.
now,
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity.
this
case
didn't
get
far
enough
for
us
to
raise
those
issues
either
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
a
trial,
but
we
are
prepared
to
prove
every
one
of
those
allegations.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
believe
that
we
have
satisfied
in
this
case
already,
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings
before
you,
the
issue
of
ripeness.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
certainly,
and--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
never
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
those
issues.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
in
our
complaint...
it's
page
40
of
the
petition
appendix...
we
alleged
that
the
restrictions
on
lake
levels
imposed
in
the
biological
opinion
adversely
affect
plaintiffs
by
substantially
reducing
the
quantity
of
available
irrigation
water.
that's
the
generalized
allegation
of
injury.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
well--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--well,
the
government
is
not,
i'm
afraid,
being
straight
with
you
in
terms
of
how
this
project
operates.
we
don't
know
because
we
haven't
gotten
the
case
this
far,
but
the
fact
is
the
project
operates
on
a
pro
rata
distribution
basis.
the
project
is
in
fact
administered
by
the
petitioner,
the
irrigation
districts.
and
what
we've
got
is
a
situation
where
it
really
doesn't
matter
in
effect
how
the
harm
or
the
loss
of
water
is
distributed.
what
we
have
is
a
situation
as
a
result
of
the
biological
opinion
that
whatever
amount
of
water
is
bestowed
by
nature,
whatever
amount
of
water
is
left
in
carryover
storage
and
so
forth,
whatever
amount
is
there,
the
biological
opinion
takes
a
certain
amount
of
that
from
all
of
us
and
we
are
left
to
divide
up
what
remains.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
did.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
alleged
on...
this
is
at
petition
appendix--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--page
32.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
petition
appendix,
page
32.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
no,
the
white
one,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
right
here.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
32
of
the
appendix
to
that,
the
very
bottom
of
the
appendix
page.
we
alleged
on
information
and
belief,
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
will
abide
by
the
restrictions
imposed
by
the
biological
opinion.
and
in
their
merits
brief,
united
states
admits
that
in
fact
the
bureau
of
reclamation
made
the
decision
to
comply.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
in
fact,
you
assume
that
they
are
true
i
believe
at
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
right.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
i
wanted
to
do
that,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
let
me
see
if
i
can
recall
the
hypothetical.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
yes.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
let
me
answer
your
question
first,
justice
o'connor.
we
believe
we
do
have
independent
causes
of
action
under
both
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
citizen
suit
provision
of
the
endangered
species
act.
in
fact,
1540(g)(5)
of
the
endangered
species
act
provides
for
redundancy
of
remedy
and
provides
that
nothing
in
the
citizen
suit
provision
will
preclude
a
petitioner
from
using
other
remedies
as
well.
and
so,
the
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
redundancy
of
remedy.
justice
breyer,
in
response
to
your
question,
i
believe
i've
answered
it
on
the
facts
of
this
case
which
are
that
the
bureau
has
already
agreed
to
comply,
but
let
me--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--deal
with
the
hypothetical
as
you
posed
it.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
sued--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--justice
scalia,
we
sued
bruce
babbitt,
secretary
of
interior.
if
we
get
a
decision
against
bruce
babbitt,
who
is
the
cabinet
secretary
responsible
for
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
we
think
as
a
practical
matter,
the
bureau
will
not
differ
from
a
decision
which
binds
the
secretary.
and
your
decisions
do
indicate
that
in
resolving
issues
of
finality,
you
use
a
doctrine
of
practicality.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
seek
to
get
the
existing
report
vacated
and
then
revised
in
accordance
with
science
because--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--well,
if
the
secretary
is
bound
by
this
decision,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
be
the
case.
the
secretary
would
presumably
have
to
comply
with
the
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
no,
i
don't
believe
he
is
in
fact,
because
he
can't
operate
this
project
without
the
incidental
take
statement
that
was
found
in
the
biological
opinion.
the
united
states
raised
the
identical
argument
that
they
are
raising
here
in
a
case
called
ramsey
v.
kantor.
it's
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
because
it
came
down
from
the
ninth
circuit
about
6
weeks
ago.
clearly
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
bind
you,
but
we
believe
their
reasoning
is
persuasive
here.
what
they
said
was
that
when
a
biological
opinion
is
issued
and
the
biological
opinion
finds
there
to
be
jeopardy,
that
a
reasonable
and
prudent
alternative
is
developed.
the
opinion
also
then
includes
an
incidental
take
statement.
they
said
the
incidental
take
statement...
that
part
of
the
biological
opinion
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
permit
to
operate
the
project.
without
it,
you
can't
operate
the
project.
the
secretary,
the
bureau
in
this
case,
had
no
possibility
of
doing
anything
other
than
complying
with
the
biological
opinion
if
it
expected
to
receive
immunity
from
civil,
or
potentially
criminal,
prosecution.
so,
in
answer
to
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
yes,
we
believe
that
the
biological
opinion
was
final
as
of
the
time
that
it
was
issued
and
that
the
bureau
in
fact
did
not
really
have
any
opportunity
as
a
practical
matter...
the
test
you
use
in
determining
finality...
to
do
anything
other
than
comply.
and
the
united
states
admits
in
its
reply
brief
that
it's
very
rare
that
these
agencies
ever
deviate.
in
fact,
they
never
cite
a
single
example
of
deviation.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
well,
we
would,
i
guess,
disagree
that
it's
tantamount
to
environmental
impact
statement
which
is
essentially--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--this
is
much
more
of
an
operative
document
in
the
sense
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
test
again
that
you
use,
you
cannot
operate
this
project
without
the
incidental
take
statement
in
the
biological
opinion.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
hold
contracts
with
the
united
states
for
water
from
this
project.
if
the
bureau's
determination
or
the
secretary's
determination
in
that
circumstance
was
believed
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
we
would
then
bring
a
lawsuit--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--i
believe
that
in
that
instance
we
are
certainly
within
the
zone
of
interest
regulated
by
the
bureau.
we
are
injured
by
the
action.
it's
traceable
to
the
secretary,
the
bureau's
decision.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
oh,
all
right.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
i
guess
there's
a
question
that
arises
whether
the
plaintiff
is
injured
by
the
action
of
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
or
the
action
of
the
secretary
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
it
doesn't
say
it's
irrelevant.
it
does
say
that
procedural
rights
are
special
and
that
normal
standards
for
redressability
and
immediacy
do
not
apply.
now,
if
we
look
at
footnote
7,
the
example
used
in
footnote
7
of
the
defenders
decision
involved
the
construction
of
a
dam
next
to
a
property
owner's
land,
and
the
issue
was
whether
the
property
owner
could,
in
that
circumstance,
compel
production
of
an
environmental
impact
statement.
we
think
the
circumstances
here
are
very
similar
in
the
sense
that
we
are
also
raising
procedural
violations.
this
project
is
in
our
back
yard.
it
is
critical
to
the
operation
of
our
farms
and
our
businesses,
and
we
have
we
believe
a
right
to
go
forward
on
procedural
arguments
and--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--in
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
posed,
it
may
or
may
not
be.
in
our
situation
it
absolutely
is
dispositive.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
and
the
apa
as
well.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
correct.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
well,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
our
case.
that's
i
suppose
the
problem
with
the
hypothetical.
our
case--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--that's
not
what
we
are
complaining
about,
justice
o'connor,
is
not
an
absence
or
a
minimum
lake
level
established
to
protect
against
drought.
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
situation
was
a
determination
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
that
these
fish
required
certain
minimum
lake
levels
in
order
to
continue
to
exist.
we
don't
believe
there's
any
science
behind
that
decision.
the
drought
had
very
little
to
do,
in
fact,
with
this
opinion.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
if
these
irrigation
releases
had
continued,
the
reservoirs
would
simply
run
out
of
water.
that
wasn't
the
situation
at
all.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
justice
kennedy,
we
believe
there
is
that
connection
in
this
case.
the
biological
opinion
is
the
thing
which
becomes
the
operating
scheme,
if
you
will,
for
the
project.
the
biological
opinion
is
not
based
on
the
existence
of
a
drought.
it's
based
upon
a
determination
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
that
certain
amounts
of
water
are
necessary
for
the
well-being
of
these
fish.
the
problem--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--we
have
with
that
is
there's
no
science
behind
that
determination.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
if
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
were
to
be
reversed
and
this
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings,
it
would
be
our
intention,
justice
ginsburg,
to
amend
the
complaint
to
name
the
bureau.
there's
no
reason
not
to
i
suppose
in
these
circumstances.
we
don't
believe
it's
necessary,
but
if
this
court
concludes
to
the
contrary
that
article
iii
or
finality
or
ripeness
considerations
require
that
the
bureau
be
named,
i
can
assure
you
the
bureau
would
be
named.
there
is
not
any
kind
of
policy
reason
i
suppose
for
not
naming
the
bureau
here.
we
felt
we
had
named
the
people
that
had
violated
the
act,
the
people
who
had
determined
that
these
minimum
reservoir
levels
were
necessary
for
the
fish,
and
that
was
enough.
if...
and
i
believe
you're
absolutely
correct
that
this
is
an
eminently
fixable
problem,
if
indeed
it's
a
problem
at
all.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
yes,
your
honor,
there
is,
and
the
legal
reason
is
that
the
endangered
species
act
requires
that
these
determinations,
including
the
one
you've
described,
be
based
on
science,
not
speculation,
not
conjecture.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
well,
he'd
be
violating
section
7
of
the
act
because
that
act
requires
that
biological
opinions
be
based
on
science.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
the
biological
opinion
is
the
result
of
the
consultation
and
that
is
the
document
that
concludes--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--yes.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
if
consultation
is...
well,
what
happens
is
that
a
biological
assessment
is
developed.
a
consultation
is
sought
by
the
action
agency,
if
you
will.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
well,
justice
souter,
that
of
course
is
not
this
case,
but
i
presume
if
there
were
no
consultation--
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
--but
it
does
only
in
the
sense
that
we're
talking
about
actions
under
the
endangered
species
act.
the
secretary
might
have
the
option
to
develop
recommended
conservation
measures.
those
measures,
however,
are
not
binding
on
agencies
such
as
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
and
since
they're
not
binding,
the
bureau
has
already
told
us
what
they
would
be
willing
to
do
and
it
didn't
involve
minimum
reservoir
levels.
so,
i
think
that
if
we
vacate
the
biological
opinion
here,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
the
bureau,
given
what
it
has
already
said,
to
impose
a
minimum
reservoir
level.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
correct.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
we
will
be
restored
to
the
priority
that
we
had
initially.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
remaining.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
thank
you,
your
honor.
simply
put,
congress
made
no
distinction
between
environmental
plaintiffs
and
resource
user
plaintiffs
when
it
provided
for
citizen
suit
review
and
apa
review.
it
simply
used
the
term,
any
person.
all
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
follow
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
if
you
do
that,
it
renders
completely
unnecessary
this
arcane,
artificial
review
process
that
the
government
is
proposing
where
you
have
to
sue
an
agency
that
didn't
propose
the
opinion,
didn't
have
the
expertise,
and
may
in
fact
disagree
with
it
internally.
mr.
gregory
k.
wilkinson
not
in
this
statute,
your
honor,
it
isn't
used.
the
opinion
that
was
issued
in
this
case
was
more
than
just
a
legal
opinion.
it
was
in
fact
an
operating
plan
for
the
project.
