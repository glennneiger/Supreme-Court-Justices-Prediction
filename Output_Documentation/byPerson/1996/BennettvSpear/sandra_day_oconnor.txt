mr.
wilkinson--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
solicitor
general
in
response
apparently
chooses
not
to
address
the
merits,
but
does
raise
an
issue
about
whether
the
petitioners
have
article
iii
standing
and
an
issue
about
whether
the
claims
are
cognizable
under
the
statutory
scheme.
were
those
arguments
raised
below
in
response
to
the
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
in
response
to
the
petition
on
certiorari?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
have
before
us
today
any
issue
on
the
apa
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
now,
is
the
article
iii
standing
issue...
does
the
resolution
of
that
depend
at
all
on
who
it
is
the
petitioners
sued,
what
agency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
enter
into
the
calculus
of
the
article
iii
standing
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
apparently
the
suit
below
was
not
brought
against
the
secretary
who
has
the
final
determination.

sandra

appendix?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
blue
brief
you
mean?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
at
page
what?
32--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--whether
in
fact
you're
relying
on
the
apa
as
the
source
of
the
action
or
whether
you
can
sue
separately
under
the
endangered
species
act
without
reference
to
the
final
agency
action
requirement
of
apa.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
counsel--
--well,
why
is
it
dispositive?
why--
--yes.
i'm
concerned
about
your
suit
is
brought
under
the
endangered
species
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
an
alternative
you
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
the
endangered
species
act,
would
that
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
a
reduction
of
water
based
on
drought
conditions?
it
wouldn't.
that
isn't
an
action
under
the
esa.
it's
an
action
to
save
endangered
species,
and
that's
what
you're
complaining
about.
how
does
a
drought
and
a
reduction
in
water
by
the
secretary
or
the
government
have
anything
to
do
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
have
anything
to
do
at
all
with
the
endangered
species
act
if
you're
complaining
about
a
change
in
water
level
because
of
absence
of
water
due
to
no
rain?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--could
we
consider
the
language
of
the
statute?
1540(g)(1)
says,
any
person
may
commence
a
civil
suit
on
his
own
behalf
to
enjoin
any
person,
including
the
united
states
and
any
other
government
agency,
who
is
alleged
to
be
in
violation
of
any
provision
of
this
chapter.
and
section
1533(b)(2)
says,
the
secretary
shall
designate
critical
habitat
on
the
basis
of
the
best
scientific
data
available
and
after
taking
into
consideration
the
economic
impact
and
so
on.
and
here
they've
sued
the
secretary,
and
that's
precisely
what
they
say
wasn't
done.
and
that
section
appears
to
be
alleged
to
have
been
violated.
why
doesn't
it
fall
under
that
citizen
suit
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
are
you
reading?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
right,
but
it's
not
exclusive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
may
be
a
right
of
action
under
the
esa--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--apart
from
apa.
