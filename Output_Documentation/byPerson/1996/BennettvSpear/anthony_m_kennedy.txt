justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
get
back
to
the
hypothetical
justice
breyer
posed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were
interrupted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
that
he
has
good
grounds
not
to
release
the
water.
he
doesn't
have
much
water.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i...
maybe
my
hypothetical
is
inept.
i'm
assuming
that
the
secretary
is
acting
within
his
proper
discretion
based
on
the
drought
conditions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
still
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
secretary
and
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
for
the
improper
preparation
of
this
report?
the
secretary
in
my
hypothetical
also
has
this
report.
he
has
two
reasons
for
not
giving
the
water.
one
is
what
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
says.
the
other
is
he
doesn't
have
any
water
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
has
to
be...
in
other
words,
there
has
to
be
some
redressability.
footnote
7
of
lujan
i
think
doesn't
completely
say
that
redressability
is
irrelevant,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel--
--and
i
take
it
you're
saying
that
there's
a
likelihood,
a
reasonable
possibility,
that
the
fish
and
wildlife
report
will
be
dispositive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
think
there
has
to
be
some
proximity,
some
redressability,
some
causation
between
the
injury
you
allege,
i.e.,
lack
of
receipt
of
the
water,
and
the
procedural
default
that
you're
alleging
under
the
endangered
species
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
in
short,
you
under
the
endangered
species
act,
although
without
talking
about
zone
of
interest,
reach
really
the
same
conclusion
as
the
ninth
circuit,
namely,
that
this
is
an
act
that
works
only
one
way
for
those
who
are
protecting
the
endangered
species
and
not
for
economic
interests
that
are
injured.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
suit
be
brought
under
the
citizen
suit
provision
of
the
endangered
species
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
it
in
the
endangered
species
act
that
limits
the
ability
to
bring
the
suit
that
we're
hypothesizing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
what
is
in
the
statute
that
leads
you
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
(c)
was
added
8
years
later?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
said,
we're
not
going
to
be
releasing
any
water
for
a
couple
years,
and
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
said,
in
reliance
on
that,
we're
not
going
prepare
a
biological
report.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
act?
and
an
endangered
species
has
been
identified,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
think
there
would
be
standing
for
someone
to
at
least
test
the
fish
and
wildlife
service's
refusal
to
prepare
a
biological
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
let's
talk
about
the
endangered
species
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
final
agency.
i'm
talking
about
whether
or
not
there's
a
suit
under
the
endangered
species
act
citizen
suit
provision--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
says,
despite
the
fact
we've
identified
an
endangered
species,
we're
not
going
to
file
a
biological
report.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
violation
of
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
quite
amazed
that
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
could
refuse
to
perform
its
duties
under
the
act
and
not
have
a
suit.
and,
of
course,
the
reason
you
don't
want
to
admit
that
it
does
is
because
then
you
can't
distinguish
that
between
a
suit
brought
by
the
plaintiffs
who
are
positioned
as
the
plaintiffs
here
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
can
characterize
it,
the
ninth
circuit
says
one-way,
then
yours
is
also
one-way,
is
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if...
let's
assume
we
disagree
with
you
with
reference
to
your
one-way
interpretation
of
the
endangered
species
act.
and
incidentally,
i
think
we
should
be
very
cautious
about
receiving
an
argument
that
destroys
the
usual
neutrality
that
we
think
underlies
the
rule
of
law
in
this
country.
but
you're
arguing
for
this
one-way
provision.
now,
let's
assume
that
we
disagree
with
you
upon
that.
isn't
there
a
likelihood...
a
likelihood,
a
very
real
likelihood...
there
of
economic
injury
based
on
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
really
the
core
of
the
inquiry
we
make
under
redressability
when
we're
determining
article
iii
standing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
we
said
there
was
article
iii
standing
in
franklin.
we
found
there
was
no
final
agency
action,
but
we
said
there
was
article
iii
standing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
you
keep
wanting
to
talk
about
the
apa.
i'm
talking
about
the
endangered
species
act.
as
i
take
it,
your
point
is
that
a
ftc
staff
recommendation
does
not
become
final
agency
action
simply
because
the
commission
itself
always
follows
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
footnote
7
in
lujan
which
seems
to
indicate
that
standing
requirements
are
somewhat
relaxed
when
it's
a
procedural
attack?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
footnote
7
of
lujan
talks
about
redressability.
you
answered
my
question
and
said,
oh,
well,
we're
talking
about
redressability.
footnote
7
says
the
standards
are
relaxed
even
with
reference
to
redressability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
it
seems
to
me
not
a
proper
argument
to
say,
well,
i'm
talking
about
redressability.
that's
what
it--
