mr.
richard
n.
hill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
it
would
not
mean
the
end
of
apprenticeship
as
we
know
it.
the
parade
of
horrors
laid
out
by
the
state
is
overstated,
and
i
believe
it
ignores
economic
reality.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
i
think
there
are
many
ways
to
take
care
of
those
abuses
like
that.
i
think
the
first
question
is--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--under
existing
law.
i
think,
for
example,
the
payroll
practice
regulation
deals
with
a
situation
where
the
employer
simply
agrees
to
provide
training
in
exchange
for
payment
without
establishing
any
program
or
plan,
and
where
there
is
no
plan
or
program,
certainly
that
may
fall
within
the
payroll
practice
regulation.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
i
think
the
difference
between
my
client's
situation
and
the
one
i
just
outlined
is
that
my
client
has
established
a
formal
plan
and
program
with
written
standards,
with
supplemental
training,
with
a
wage
progression
that
corresponds
to
periods
of
training,
and--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--well,
i
think
the
reason
that
this
contract--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i'm
not
sure...
i
think
the
reason
that
this
apprenticeship
program
was
established
was
that
we
have
this
federal
system
of
creating
incentives
to
comply
with
apprenticeship
programs--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i
think
i
would
put
it
slightly
differently.
i
think
the
reason
this
plan
was
established
was--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--to
comply
with
federal
standards.
the
incentive,
the
carrot,
as
it
were,
under
the
federal
system
of
apprenticeship
is,
you
get
people
to
go
out
and
create
apprenticeship
programs
and
people
want
to
comply
with
the
federal
fitzgerald
act
standards
so
that
they
can
bid
on
federal
public
works
projects
and
other
federal
projects
having
a
federal
purpose.
and
it's
this
voluntary
system
created
by
the
fitzgerald
act
that
we
want
people
to
go
out...
we
want
to
encourage
people
to
go
out
and
encourage
apprenticeship
programs
and
plans,
and
the
carrot
is
that
if
you
do
that,
and
you
comply
with
the
federal
standards,
then
you
can
bid
work
for
federal
public
works
projects,
you
can
pay
the
apprentice
rates
on
federal
projects.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
don't
think
that
happened
in
this
particular
case,
because
we
had
the
program
and
the
plan
in
effect.
the
standards
were
in
place,
as
conceded
by
mr.
rea,
when
the
work
was
being
performed.
we
had
a
little
difficulty
create...
getting
the
supplemental
instruction
set
up,
so
the
plan
was
in
place
when
the
work
was
being
performed,
and
the
apprentices
were
being
paid
in
accordance
with
the
plan.
they
were
being
paid
in
accordance
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
all
that
happened
in
this
case
was
that
we
didn't
get
the
approval
from
the
state
until
some
later
point
in
time,
but
my
client
was,
i
believe,
in
all
respects
complying
with
the
plan.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
if
we
had
not
followed
the
plan,
that
i
think
would
create
a
whole
different
set
of
problems.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
i
think
there
are
several
safeguards
in
place.
you
have
to--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--okay.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
don't
think
that
is...
i
don't
think
that
affirming
this
case
is
really
going
to
open
the
floodgates.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
think
my
answer
is
yes,
as
long
as
you
set
up
an
apprenticeship
plan
that
meets
the
erisa
standard,
and
that
may
be
very
different
from
the
state
standard
of
what
an
apprenticeship
training
program
ought
to
be.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
erisa
does
not
regulate
training
because
i
think
erisa
really
leaves
it
to
employers
to...
it
doesn't
set
a
minimum
set
of
benefits,
so
it's
really
up
to
the
employers
to
create
their
own
diverse
set
of
training
programs.
the
real
safeguards
in
federal
law
are
the
fitzgerald
act
regulations
which--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--well,
it...
certainly
within
the
last
30
or
40
years
there
was
some
regulation
of
apprenticeship,
but
it's
this
conjunction
of
regulation
of
apprenticeship
and
prevailing
wage
legislation
that
has
only
come
into
existence
within
the
last
20,
30
years.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
that's
a
hard
question.
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
i
guess
one
of
the
things
that's
different
about
apprenticeship
is
that
we
have
this
system,
this
voluntary
system
that
the
federal
fitzgerald
act
regulations
set
up
the
standards
that
one
must
meet
in
order
to
gain
federal
approval,
and
i
think
it's
that.
it's
the
incentive
of
complying
with
that
system
that
makes
this
case...
makes
apprenticeship
unique
among
employee
welfare
benefit
plans.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
i
guess
my
response
to
that
is
that
the
connection
in
a
case
like
this
is
that
the
employers
have
set
up
a
plan
and
a
program
that...
with
a
detailed
set
of
standards
and
wage
progressions,
and
what
the
state
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
regulate
that
and
tell
the
employers
they
may
not
comply
with
the
plan
that
they
have
set
up,
and
once
that
plan
has
been
interfered
with
in
that
way,
you
are
interfering
with
the
congressional--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
responses.
first
of
all,
as
i
read
the
cases,
if
erisa
preemption
is
express,
as
i
believe
it
is
in
this
case,
then
we
don't
need--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i...
well,
i
think
my
position,
although
you
may
not
need
to
reach
this
in
order
to
get
a
result
in
this
case,
my
position
is
that
every
plan
or
program
to
create
apprenticeship
is
covered
by
erisa
whether
it's
funded
or
unfunded.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
don't
believe
i
have
trouble
under
morash.
as
i
read
that
case
it
was
limited
to
the
situation
where
a
single
employer
was
paying
vacation
out
of
its
own
general
assets,
and
i
believe
the
court
said
that
we
would
have
a
different
situation
if
a
group
of
employers
had
set
up
a
separate
trust
fund
to
pay
vacation
benefits
for
a
larger
group
of
employees.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
believe
that's
possible
as
long--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--that
is
my
theory.
as
long
as
there
is
a
genuine
plan
or
program
and
not
something
that's
simply--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--that's
right,
and
i--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i...
that
is
my
theory.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
i
think
that
we
can
imagine
an
unfunded...
i
guess
in
morash
i
think
the
court
dealt
with
by
saying
that
where
there
is
a
risk
different
than
simply
the
risk
of
employment,
and
one
can
imagine
a
apprenticeship
program
or
plan
which
has
detailed
standards,
detailed
training
requirements
and
those
sorts
of
things
which
happens
to
be
unfunded,
and
i
believe
that
the
congressional
intent
is
to
regulate
those
sorts
of--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i
think
that
is
one
of
the
risks
that
we
are
concerned
about
when
you
have
these
multiemployer
funded
plans.
you
also
have
the
risk
of,
or
have
the
concerns
with
the
administration
of
detailed
plans,
and
i
think
that
risk,
the
desire
for
administrative
integrity,
would
attach
to
some
unfunded
plans.
disclosure
requirements
can
apply
to
unfunded
plans
as
well
as
funded
plans.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
there
may
be
very
limited
disclosure
requirements,
but
you
may
have
to
disclose
who
is
administering
the
plan,
what
the
relationships
of
those
people
are
to
the
participating
employers,
what
the
standards
are,
how
one
gets
training,
what
kinds
of
things,
what
a
person
must
do
to
complete
the
apprenticeship,
so
the
disclosure
may
be
limited,
but
there
may
be
some
disclosure.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
the
logical
extension
of
my
position
is
that
erisa
will
protect
many
different
varieties
of
training
and
apprenticeship
programs,
other
than
the
type
of
program
we
have
here
before...
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
and...
i
think
that's
partly
correct.
i
would
agree
with
that,
and
i
would
say
that
this
is
inherent
in
the
structure
of
erisa
and
the
fitzgerald
act,
because--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--well,
this
sounds
very
close
to
what
the
department
of
labor
is
attempting
to
prevent
through
their
payroll
practice
regulation,
because
if
a
single
employer
just
says,
i'm
going
to
establish
a
health
plan,
and
i
pay
for
it
out
of
my
general
assets--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--that
is
a
difficult
question,
i
concede,
because
if
you
take
that
to
the
logical
extent,
i
suppose
a
program,
a
plan
could
be
created
for
that
purpose,
and
it's
probably
unlikely
to
happen
in
the
real
world
because
employers
don't
want
to
go--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i
think
that
is
to
some
extent
a
risk,
and
i
think
it's
perhaps
inherent
in
congress'--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i'm--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i'm
not
sure
i
can
draw
that
line.
i
suppose
that
in
the
real
world
employers
are
much
more
likely
to
join
together
to
create
apprenticeship
and
training
programs
than
they
are
to
join
together
to
create
health
clubs
or
legal--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--and--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--and--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--well--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i
concede
that's
a
problem,
and
i
think
it
is
possible
to
decide
this
case
in
my
favor
without
reaching
this
larger
issue
of
what...
how
far
erisa
applies
to
apprenticeship
programs,
because
this,
in
fact,
was
a
multiemployer-funded
apprenticeship
program,
and
perhaps
the
decision
can
be
limited
to
that.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
why--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--and
i
think
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
this
particular
case
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
draw
that
line.
there
may
be
a
future
case--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i
feel
it's
a
difficult
line
because
erisa
does
not
define
that
line,
the
regulations
do
not
define
that
line,
and
my
best
response
is
that
in
this
particular
case
virtually
all
the
parties,
save
and
except
the
afl-cio,
have
conceded
that
this
particular
apprenticeship
program
is
governed
by
erisa.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
it
was
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
yes.
the
employer--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i
frankly
have
a
difficult
time
kind
of
understanding
the
logical...
logic
of
that
argument.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
believe
that's
their
position--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--well,
i
think
my
first
response
is
that
this
was...
the
regulation
itself,
the
payroll
practice
regulation
is
limited
to
provisions
of
training
out
of
an
employer's
general
assets,
and
we
don't
have
that
situation
here
because
we
have
payments
into
a
separate
trust
fund
and
that
fund
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
larger
program.
i
think
the
second
distinction
between
this
and
the
morash
case
is
that
morash
was
limited
to
payments
by
a
single
employer
out
of
its
general
assets.
we
have
a
large
group
of
employers
in
this
particular
case.
and
in
response
to
the
larger
argument
made
by
the
government,
it
is
that
once
you
concede
that
this
particular
apprenticeship
program
is
governed
by
erisa,
then
i
believe
the
logical
conclusion
is
that
california's
law
relates
to
that
plan
because
it
is
regulating
how
those
apprentices
are
going
to
be
paid
and
trained.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
i
have
several
responses
to
that.
one
is,
where
we
have
express
preemption
i
don't
think
we
need
to
get
into
the
question
of
what
is
traditional
state
regulation.
i
think
beyond
that
we
need
to
look
at
the
express
language
of
the
fitzgerald
act
regulations,
because
that
goes
to
the
question
of--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--and--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--i
think
there
are
several
additional
responses
in
that
regard.
i
think
the
california
statute
specifically
refers
to
apprenticeship
plans,
and
it...
that's
one.
it
attempts
to
regulate
the
substantive
content
of
apprenticeship
plans
by
dictating
how
much
employers
can
pay
people,
how
much...
and
how
training
is
to
be
provided.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
i
didn't
read
the
traveler's
decision
that
way.
i
think
this
really
goes
to
the
question
of
what
you
intended
by
that
decision.
i
read
that
to
be
a
fairly
limited
decision
which
applies
to
a
specific
classes
of
cases
where
erisa
preemption
is
not
obvious.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
make
that
distinction,
given
the
express
language
of
erisa.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
would
apply
because
that
wouldn't
be
inconsistent
with
what
the
apprenticeship
program
provides.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
that's
certainly
a
more
difficult
question.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
and
i
suppose
the
only
difference
about
safety
is
that
that
is
really
not
an
integral
part
of
ordinary
apprenticeship
programs,
but
i'm
not
sure
that's--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--it
is
possible
that
apprenticeship
programs
will
have
safety
standards.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
don't
believe
that
the
labor
code
provision
makes
any
distinction
between
funded
or
unfunded
plans.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
i
don't
believe
there
is.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
well,
again,
if...
regardless
of
whether
we
have
a
funded
or
unfunded
plan,
if
the
state
is
telling
the
apprenticeship
program
they
can't
comply
with
their
own
standards,
in
our
view
there
is
preemption,
and
i
think
that's
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
no.
i
believe
that
that--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--once
you
get
to
the
point
that
a
vacation
plan
is
covered
by
erisa
as
opposed
to
being
a
morash-type
payroll
practice,
then
yes,
that
is
my
position.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
my
best
response
to
that
is
that
the
statute
does
not
make
that
distinction
between
the
funded...
the
funding
aspects
of
an
apprenticeship
program
and
all
the
other
aspects
of
the
program.
i
think
that
requires
a
judicial
gloss
on
the
statute
which
just
isn't
apparent
from
the
explicit
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
n.
hill
no.
i...
my
position
is
this
is
a
different
case
because
it
involves
many
employers,
it's
a
funded
program--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--and
i
believe
it
is
possible
to
limit
this
decision
to
funded
apprenticeship
programs
like
we
have
in
this
particular
case,
although
that
is
not
the
position
that
i'm
advocating
here.
nevertheless,
that
may
be
a
way
of
deciding
the
case.
in
conclusion,
i
think
the
point
that...
about
erisa
and
the
fitzgerald
act
is
that
it
creates
a
voluntary
system
for
promoting
apprenticeship.
employers
are
encouraged
to
create
apprenticeship
programs
with
the
carrot
of
being
able
to
participate
in
federal
public
works
projects.
when
the
state--
mr.
richard
n.
hill
--thank
you,
your
honor.
