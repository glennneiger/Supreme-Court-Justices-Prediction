mr.
john
m.
rea
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
california
seeks
reversal
of
dillingham
because
our
california
law
does
not
relate
to
erisa
plans.
even
if
it
did,
the
relationship
is
one
which
is
under
another
federal
statute
and
regulation,
the
fitzgerald
act,
which
erisa
may
not
modify
and
impair.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
second
argument,
because
it
allows
me
to
talk
about
the
practical
effects
on
apprenticeship
of
the
dillingham
rule.
mr.
john
m.
rea
the
answer,
justice
kennedy,
depends
on
which
this.
the
plan
set
up
by
the
nestu
union
and
the
employers
was
an
apprenticeship
plan
under
erisa,
and
then
at
the
point
it
got
approved
it
became
a
registered
apprenticeship
plan
under
the
fitzgerald
act.
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
john
m.
rea
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
rea
no,
that's
not
a
hypothetical.
of
course,
the
state
doesn't
know
much
about
them
if
they
don't
come
to
us
for
registration.
one
of
the...
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
answers
in
this
record.
one
of
the
research
studies
by
the
bureau
of
apprenticeship
training
estimated
that
about
half
of
apprenticeship
going
on
was
not
registered.
secondly,
historic
under
the
solicitor...
under
the
department
of
labor
regulations
any
unfunded
apprenticeship
plan
is
not
covered
by
erisa.
and
finally,
historically,
apprenticeship
was
around
a
long
time
before
erisa
and
before
there
were
any--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--yes.
mr.
john
m.
rea
yes,
your
honor.
we
are...
our
law
is
indifferent
as
to
whether
they're
covered
by
erisa,
and
the
fitzgerald
act
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
areas
of
erisa
concern,
funding,
money
in
or
money
out.
mr.
john
m.
rea
yes.
the
secretary
of
labor's
definition,
we
use
unfunded
as
shorthand,
and
our
law...
if
someone
comes
to
us
and
wants
to
register
a
plan
or
have
an
apprentice
work
on
public
works
we
don't
inquire
whether
they're
erisa-covered
or
not.
we'll
approve
him
if
they
meet
the
fitzgerald
act
standards,
which
we've
incorporated
in
our
state
law.
mr.
john
m.
rea
that
there
is
no
trust
fund
or
arrangement
by
which
the
employer
or
a
group
of
employers
put
in
money
and
then
use
that
to
pay
for
the
operation
of
the
training.
mr.
john
m.
rea
we
frankly
don't
care.
i
mean,
historically
these
plans,
certainly
the
history
of
the
fitzgerald
act,
these
plans
were
being
organized
during
the
depression,
when
everybody
had
more
time
than
money,
and
single
employer
plans,
typically
there's
no
reason,
because
apprenticeship
is
so
closely
associated
with
work,
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
setting
up
a
fund.
mr.
john
m.
rea
one
of
the
reasons,
justice
kennedy,
why
it's
not...
we've
asked
ourselves
the
same
question.
we
can't
tell
how
many
funded
plans
there
are
because
we
never
asked
the
question
in
the
registration
process.
the
effects
of
the
ninth
circuit
rule
that
states
really
have
no
business
insisting
that
those
paid
as
apprentices
under
our
public
works
be
registered
apprentices
would
modify
and
impair
the
fitzgerald
act,
because
that
act
directs
the
secretary
of
labor
to
promote
standards
necessary
to
safeguard
the
welfare
of
apprentices,
and
to--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--it
doesn't
impose
specific
legal
requirements,
chief
justice,
because
it's
a
voluntary
act,
but
it's
not
merely
precatory
either.
it
directs
the
secretary
to
promote
and
invites...
and
under
that
act
he
invites
the
states
into
a
partnership.
if
the
fitzgerald
act
merely
said,
registered
apprenticeship
is
a
good
and
wonderful
thing,
and
that's
the
policy
of
the
united
states,
i'd
be
constrained
to
agree
with
you,
but
it
doesn't.
it
directs
the
secretary
to
promote,
and
the
history
shows
that
they
promote
and
formulate
standards,
and
this
particular
definition
of
apprenticeship
at
issue
here
through
the
fitzgerald
act
and
through
the
regulations
we
rely
on
both
the
act,
which
is
somewhat
general,
and
the
rather
long
tail
of
regulations
which
have
followed
from
it.
we
rely
on
both
of
those
for
our
savings
clause
argument
because
it
covers
federal
law
and
regulations
under
those
laws.
the
problem
that--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--yes,
it
operates
as
an
incentive.
mr.
john
m.
rea
yes.
it's
an
incentive
to
those
out
there
who
have
a
training
plan
which
is--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--sort
of
organized
but
not
approved
to
come
up
to
the
fitzgerald
act
standards
because
then
they'll
be
able
to
not
only
do
our
work,
but
they'll
be
able
to
do
davis-bacon
work,
but
it's
also
in
our
interest
to
do
it,
and
the
states
owns
these
buildings,
in
this
case
a
jail.
we're
very,
very
concerned
with
the
competence
of
the
people
who
do
this
particular
one,
and
who
do
our
jails
in
the
future.
we
want
to
have
a
skilled
workforce
available
even
for
such
things
as
wiring.
it's
our...
and
the
standards
under
the
fitzgerald
act
address
those
concerns
very
directly,
because
they
say
that
the
people
who
will
be
brought
on
as
apprentices
will
have
a
commitment
of
at
least
2,000
hours...
this
is
not
just
something
tinkered
together
for
the
plan...
that
they'll
have
related
and
supplemental
instructions
so
that
they'll
have
some
theory
behind
what
they're
doing,
that
they'll
be...
most
importantly
to
us,
there'll
be
a
fixed
ratio
of
journey-level
persons
to
apprentices,
so
you
don't
have
two
foremen
and
35
people
named
as
apprentices--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--well--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--well,
the
question
is
from
who...
i
guess
i'm
responding
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
state.
it's--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--yes.
mr.
john
m.
rea
but
from
the--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--well,
it's
true
that
it
is
an
incentive--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--no
one
is
required
to
either
bid
on
public
works
or--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--or
to
use--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--and
if
they
want
to
use
unregistered
apprentices
they
have
to
pay
them
at
the
journey
rate.
from
our
point
of
view
it's
a
good
housekeeping
seal
of
approval.
it
addresses
a
lot
of
concerns.
from
the
contractor's
point
of
view,
or
even
if
there's
an
apprenticeship
plan
back
there,
erisa-covered
or
not,
it
is
just
an
incentive.
it's
not
an
order.
there
is
no
law
in
california,
or
as
far
as
i
know
in
any
other
state.
mr.
john
m.
rea
it's
an...
it's
both
an...
from
our
point
of
view,
it's
a
quality
guarantee.
from
the
point
of
view
of--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--to
do
it,
yes.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
erisa...
of
an
apprenticeship
plan,
erisa-covered
or
not,
it
is
merely
an
incentive,
and
if
the
preemption
analysis--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--the
coercive
aspect
is
in
the
prevailing
wage
law.
we
set
a
prevail...
like
most,
almost
the
majority
of
the
states
we
set
a
prevailing
wage
for
public
works
for
various
reasons,
and
if
you
misclassify
or
mispay
someone,
we
will
make
you
pay
the
difference
in
a
small
penalty.
that
is
coercive,
as
here.
the
reason
apprenticeship
is
involved
is
because
when
caught
with
this
mispayment
the
contractor's
response
was,
oh,
these
are
apprentices,
so
meeting
apprenticeship
standards
is
voluntary,
but
when
you
get
caught
fooling
us
about
who
the
apprentices
are,
we'll
apply
the
prevailing
wage
law,
as
here.
mr.
john
m.
rea
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
m.
rea
the
reason
we're
taking
that
position
is
because,
although
it
provides
a
neat
answer
in
this
case,
it
addresses
more...
it
addresses
larger
issues
of
erisa
jurisprudence
than
we
need
to
answer,
particularly
because
you'd
have
the
same
question
about
funded-unfunded
in
day-care
centers
and
legal
services
plans
and
we
think
we've
bitten
off
enough
without
trying
to
answer
those.
the
funding-un...
nonfunded
distinction
in
the
department
of
labor's
definition
seems
to
us
to
make
sense
in
apprenticeship,
without
trying
to
make
a
broader
rule,
because
apprentice--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--yes,
and
vacation
fund
is
fairly
close
to
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
rea
yes.
it's--
mr.
john
m.
rea
--well,
you
hadn't
spoken
to
apprenticeship
and
the
verbal
formulation
of
apprenticeship
is
a
little
different.
i
mean,
we're
not
saying
that
the
afl-cio's
argument
is
impossible
based
on
pure
language
it's
certainly
possible.
it
just
doesn't
have
any
legislative
history
or
serve
to
explain
other
sections,
and
that's
why
we'd
say
it's
not
proven.
mr.
john
m.
rea
it's
ordinary
work.
mr.
john
m.
rea
there's
no
other
case.
the
only
things
in
erisa
which
are
in
the
list
of
possible
benefits
provided
by
an
erisa-covered
arrangement
that
are
similar
to
this
are
vacations,
because
they're
so
much
like
ordinary
work,
but
apprenticeship
or
other
training,
and
other
training
is
clearly
covered
in
the
same
phrase,
are,
showing
up
to
work,
getting
assignments
from
your
supervisor,
doing
those,
learning
as
you
go,
and
that's
why
it's
so
closely
tied
to
work.
i
believe
the
reasons
stated
by
the
department
of
labor
and
the
federal
register
section
quoted
in
the
united
states
brief
for
using
funding
was
because
of
the
great
difficulty
in
separating
out
apprenticeship
or
other
training
from
ordinary
work.
it's
not
like
the
pension
that
you
get
after
work,
or
health
benefits
that
you
buy
in
a
package
and
are
handed.
it's
very
much
integrated,
and
the
only
way
they
really
had
to
keep
from
federalizing
vast
areas
of
american
employment
law
was
by
saying,
well,
when
it's
funded,
we'll
look
at
the
special
erisa-related
problems
that
funding
brings.
mr.
john
m.
rea
there's
no
way
to
get
around
that,
and
certainly
we
think
it
deserves
the
same
treatment
as
the
issue
of
vacations,
that
there
is
a
definitional
problem
that
this
court
recognized
in
morash,
and
you
have
to
resolve
it
with
the
purpose
of
what
congress
wanted
to
cover
in
benefit
provision
arrangements,
and
the
secretary
has
i
think
made
the
best
effort
at
that.
the
problems
that
we
have
in
operation
of
the
dillingham
law
touch
each
of
the
groups
mentioned
in
the
fitzgerald
act.
as
to
the
contractors,
those
who
join
programs
that
meet
the
federal
standards,
they
invest
in
their
apprentices,
and...
especially
in
the
early
years.
that
raises
their
labor
costs.
every
time
that
they
lose
a
job
to
someone
like
sound
systems,
inc.
who's
just
using
temporary
installers
and
calling
them
apprentices,
that
discourages
their
participation
in
plans.
nothing
discourages
contractors
as
much
as
losing
bids.
as
to
the
apprentices,
the
second
effect
on
state
jobs
where
the
temporary
installers
work
is,
those
are
jobs
on
which
the
apprentices
and
registered
programs
can't
earn
any
money
and
can't
learn
anything.
the
biggest
problem
with
keeping
apprentices
working
is
getting
them
enough
apprentice
work.
those
that
drop
out
are
unavailable
for
a
contractor
bidding
on
a
federal
jail
that
needs
wiring.
those
that
manage
to
hang
on
in
spite
of
not
having
jobs
are
just
a
lot
less
trained
than
they
would
be
otherwise.
this
really
discourages
the
use...
shrinking
the
pool
discourages
the
use
of
apprentices
on
federal
projects.
the
third
problem
is
that
having
wildly
different
kinds
of
work
experience
called
apprenticeship
by
two
different
levels
of
government,
and
under
the
dillingham
rule
there
will
be
state
apprenticeship,
which
can
be
pulling
wires
and
hanging
speakers,
and
somebody
telling
you
to
go
to
school,
and
then
registered
apprenticeship,
where
you,
you
know,
engage
and
commit
to
this
long
course
of
study.
that
confuses
the
private
sector
that
we
rely
on
to
make
the
system
work.
the
contractors,
the
schools
that
train
apprentices,
and
people
thinking
of
going
into
apprenticeship.
the
fourth
bad
effect
of
the
dillingham
rule
is
admittedly
a
prediction.
for
nearly
60
years,
the
states
have
been
willing
to
engage
in
this
partnership
for
high
quality
standards.
we
use
the
definition
of
apprentice,
the
federal
davis-bacon
uses
it,
all
of
these
federal
laws
use
it,
other
laws
of
ours,
like
minimum
wage,
use
it.
if
we
can't
use
that
definition,
if
we're
forced
to
take
people
like
temporary
installers
as
our
apprentices,
the
states
will
give
the
job
back
to
the
feds.
mr.
john
m.
rea
well,
we're...
you've
asked
two
questions,
and
let
me
take
them
in
reverse
order.
we're
not
excluding
erisa-covered
apprentices.
we're
excluding
apprentices
who
don't
meet
the
fitzgerald
act
standards,
and
we're
indifferent
to
whether
they're
erisa-covered
or
not.
but
the
problem
you've
put
your
finger
on
is,
if
we
preach
to
the
contractors,
the
apprentices,
the
people
who
own
buildings,
that
the
way
to
go
is
to
meet
these
high
federal
standards
of
apprenticeship
and
don't
practice
what
we
preach,
it's
a...
preaching
is
much
hindered
by
hypocrisy.
mr.
john
m.
rea
i
suppose
it
would,
but
our
interest
is
not
only
truth
in
advertising
and
promotion
but
also
the
state's
interest,
because...
in
really
getting
apprenticeship
back
for
that
wage
rate,
because
those
are
our
youth,
those
are
our
trainees,
and,
frankly,
that's
our
jail.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
address
is,
the
dillingham
rule
really
interferes
with
the
interest
in
uniformity
that
motivated
much
of
erisa.
what
we
have
is
a
rule
that
makes
the
definition
of
apprentice
on
state
public
works
the
same
as
federal,
and
erisa's
theory
about
the
need
for
uniformity
was
that
uniformity
promotes
the
furtherance
of
benefits.
the
dillingham
rule
does
the
opposite,
because
the
sound
system
apprentices
here,
for
example,
could
not
work
on
a
davis-bacon
job
in
california,
oregon,
nevada
or
anywhere
else.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
mr.
john
m.
rea
then
i
think
i
have
one
point
and
one
suggestion.
the
one
point
was,
counsel
referred
to
their
plan
as
a
genuine
plan
or
program,
and
certainly
after
they
got
their
act
together
and
they
found
that
school
in
february,
we
did
approve
the
program.
work
went
on
between
october
and
february
without
it.
but
erisa
under
the
case
of
donovan
v.
dillingham
permits
preemption
if
you
just
have
a
plan
that's
covered
by
erisa.
it
doesn't
have
to
comply
with
anything,
and
i
can
write
an
erisa
plan
under
the
donovan
case
with
intended
beneficiaries,
no
particular
amount
of
funding,
intended
training,
in
about
5
minutes.
there's
no
guarantee
that
things
would
come
up
as
well
as
they
finally
did
in
this
case.
the
suggestion
was
on
the
issue
on
which
you
were
pursuing
the
solicitor,
which
is,
what's
the
sense
of
this
funded-unfunded
distinction?
obviously,
i
can't
speak
for
the
secretary
of
labor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
logical
line
is
this.
