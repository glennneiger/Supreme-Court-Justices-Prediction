mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
judgment
in
this
case
should
be
reversed,
both
because
the
state's
prevailing
wage
law
does
not
relate
to
erisa
plans
and
because,
if
it
did,
it
would
be
saved
under
the
section
114040...
1144(d)
savings
clause.
with
regard
to
the
relates-to
issue,
our
position
is
that
the
general
principle
is
that
where
a
state
is
regulating
an
activity,
that
an
employer
may
carry
out
through
an
erisa
plan
or
may
carry
out
through
a
non-erisa
plan,
and
where
the
state's
regulation
neither
encourages
nor
discourages,
nor
prohibits
nor
requires
the
employer
from
doing
it
by
means
of
the
erisa
plan,
that
the
state
regulation
is
not
preempted.
in
that
case,
it
would
be
most
natural
to
say
that
the
state's
regulation
relates
to
the
activity
at
issue,
here
training
programs,
and
not
to
erisa
plans.
now,
in
shaw
v.
delta
airlines,
if
you
look
at
the
last
few
pages,
the
last
issue
that
the
court
dealt
with
in
its
opinion
in
that
case
concerned
a
new
york
state
regulation
of
disability
insurance.
it
was
clear
that
disability
insurance
could
be
offered
either
by
an
employer
through
an
erisa
plan,
or
it
could
be
offered
through
a
non-erisa
plan.
the
court
held
that
even
for
those
employees
who
choose
to
offer
it
through
an
erisa
plan,
that
that
doesn't
render...
they
can't
thereby
immunize
themselves
from
the
state's
regulation.
the
state's
regulation
related
to
disability
laws,
not
to
erisa
plans,
and
therefore
the
state
could
continue
to
enforce
those
regulations.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
i
think...
well,
the
basis
is
this
court's
decision
in
massachusetts
v.
morash,
and
the
secretary
of
labor's
regulations
on
which
that
was
based.
apprenticeship...
apprenticeship,
it's
not
just
apprenticeship,
it's
apprenticeship
and
other
training
programs,
and
those
are
ubiquitous
in
the
workplace.
training
goes
on
every
day
at
all
degrees
of
formality,
from
totally
informal
to
very
formal
programs
in
every
workplace
in
the
country.
congress
did
not
intend,
when
it
enacted
erisa,
as
the
court
recognizes
in
massachusetts
v.
morash,
it
didn't
intend
to
oust
the
states
from
their
very
traditional
jurisdiction
over
their
basic
employment
relationship.
that
is,
the
employer
gives
money
to
the
employee,
and
the
employee
does
what
the
employer
tells
the
employee
to
do,
and
if
that's
get
trained,
then
the
employee
gets
trained.
if
it's
do
some
work
and
get
some
training
and
go
attend
some
courses,
then
that's
what
the
employee
does.
erisa
was
not
intended
to
oust
the
states
from
their
kind
of
very
basic
and
traditional
regulatory
authority
over
that.
where
a
fund
is
introduced,
it
introduces
a
separate
risk,
as
this
court
said
in
morash,
and
those
cases
where
separate
risk
is
introduced,
then
erisa
takes
effect,
and
if
an
employee--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
what
i
mean
is,
where
the
employer...
where
it's
not
just
a
question
of
the
employer
paying
the
employee
money
and
the
employee
goes
and
gets
training
or
does
what
the
employer
says
to
do,
but
the
employer
sets
aside
a
fund
and
says,
i'm
setting
aside
this
fund
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
to
accomplish
such-and-such
goals,
training,
so
on,
maybe
with
other...
in
concert
with
other
employees.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
not,
and
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
difference
is
that
as
the
court...
that
was
exactly
the
difference
that
the
court
relied
on
in
massachusetts
v.
morash,
and
the
difference
is,
where
it's
just
the...
it's
impossible
to
distinguish
what's
going
on
from
the
normal
payment
of
compensation
to
a
worker
in
return
for
the
worker's
normal
taking
care
of
his
job
in
the
case
where
the
compensation
just
comes
out
of
the
employer's
pocket,
and
moreover--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
doesn't...
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i...
actually,
i
don't
think
that...
it
doesn't
really
have
anything
to
do
with
relates-to.
what
the
court
said
in
morash
was
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
entire
term,
plan,
fund
or
program
for
the
purpose
of
giving
vacation
benefits.
similarly,
in
this
case
it
really
has
to
do
with
the
entire
meaning
of
the
whole
phrase
there
in
section
1002,
plan,
fund
or
program
for
the
purpose
of
providing
apprenticeship
or
other
training
benefits.
it's
really
the
exact...
an
exact
parallel,
and
let
me
give
an
example
that's
not
really
that
far
from
this
case.
imagine
that
a
hospital--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
order
to
be
a...
it
has...
the
secretary
of
labor
has
determined
that
in
order
to
distinguish
between
normal
workplace,
what
goes
on
normally
in
the
workplace
and
the
kind
of
benefit
programs
that
erisa
was
designed
to
regulate,
that
the
distinction
in
the
case
of
apprenticeship
and
other
training
programs
is
between
funded
programs
which
are
benefits
of
the
sort
erisa
is
intended
to
regulate
and
nonfunded
programs,
which
is
just
the
employer
hiring
the
employee.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
but
also--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right,
but
also
the
statute
throughout
and
in
the
pre...
in
section
1001
which
talks
about
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
elsewhere
throughout
the
statute
talks...
it's
quite
clear
that
the
statute
is
directed
towards
benefits.
it's
not
directed
toward
just
an
employer
who
decides
to
get...
to
pay
an
employee
and
says
go
and
learn
how
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
the
secretary
does
have
statutory
authority
in
29
u.s.c.
1135.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
basis
in...
the
basis
is
that
that
term,
that
entire
phrase,
plan,
fund,
or
program
for
the
purposes
of
providing
apprenticeship
or
other
training
programs
itself
has
to
be...
that
itself...
that
it's
really
a
definition
of
that
whole
term,
and
i
will
admit
that
the
distinction
between
funding
and
unfunded
in
this
case,
as
in
massachusetts
v.
morash,
that
that's
not
something
you're
going
to
find
in
black's
law
dictionary
if
you
look
up
any
of
those
individual
words.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
but
it
is.
it
is,
i
think,
in
the
statute,
because
throughout
the
statute...
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
section
1001,
if
you
look
up
even
1144,
what
the
statute
talks
about
is
benefit
programs,
not
the
basic
employ...
payment
of
wages
in
return
for
work.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
i
don't
think
i'm
saying
that.
i
think
i'm
saying
that
the
entire
clause
has
to
be
understood
with
some
limitation.
if
not,
it
would
take
over
the
entire
role
of
just
what
goes
on
in
the
everyday
workplace,
and
that
was
not
congress'
intent.
if
you
look
at
the
wording
throughout
the
statute
where
it
talks
about
employee
benefit
programs,
and
the
example
i
wanted
to
give
was,
if
you
take
a--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if
you
take
an
internship
at
a
hospital,
which
is
very
much
like
an
apprenticeship
program,
and
it's
certainly
a
training
program,
according
to
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
in
this
case...
and
an
internship
could
be
organized
with
a
separate,
as
an
erisa
plan,
and
in
our
view
it
could
be
organized
as
a
non-erisa
training
program.
under
the
rule
that
california...
that
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
in
this
case,
the
state
would
be
entirely
disabled
from
regulating
how
many
interns...
how
many
doctors
you
need
to
supervise
interns
in
a
hospital,
under
what
circumstances
an
intern
may...
can
assist
in
surgery,
all
kinds
of
things
like
that.
now,
that
perhaps
is
one
extreme
case,
but
that's
a
training
program
just
like
the
training
program
in
this
case,
and
the
need--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
exactly
right,
and
if
you...
in
the
morash
opinion
the
court
says,
you
could
construe
all
vacation
plans
to
be
erisa
plans.
that
was
clear.
you
could
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
the
whole
statute
and
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--because...
i
think
because
the
training
program
itself
as
something
that
the
employer
has
set
up
is
not
going
to
some
outside
provider.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
think
that's
right,
but
i
do
think
that
raises
a...
it
would
be
a
slightly
different
question
as
why
various
state
regulations
of
the
travel
agent
wouldn't
be
preempted,
and
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--thank
you.
