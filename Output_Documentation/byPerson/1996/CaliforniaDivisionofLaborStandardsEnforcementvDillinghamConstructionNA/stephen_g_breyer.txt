breyer
--so
if
that's
so,
and...
the
fact
that
an
employer
sets
aside
a
trust
fund
to
buy
vacations
for
his
employees
does
not
make
all
the
travel
agencies
and
hotels
involved
erisa
plans,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
why
isn't
the
same
thing
true
with
a
trust
fund
set
up
to
buy
apprenticeship
programs?
why,
in
other
words,
take
the
other
side
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
if
you
do
have
a
trust
fund,
pension
fund,
et
cet...
or
erisa
plan
set
up
to
fund
apprenticeship
programs,
why
does
that
make
the
program
itself
an
erisa
program,
any
more
than
with
vacations?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
other
words,
if
the
vacation
travel
agent
happens
to
be
somebody
who
does
the
employer's
vacation
planning,
the
travel
business
becomes
an
erisa
program?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
a
fairly
clear
line
to
say
that...
oh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
doesn't
that
help--
--you
wouldn't
let
the
state
decide,
for
example,
that
employers
shall
not...
shall
not
have
vacation
plans
other
than
a
certain
type,
would
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can...
why
doesn't
it
help
to
cut
through
the
morass
just
what
the
chief
justice
said,
which
is,
we
make
a
basic
distinction
between
the
funding
mechanism,
which
is
the
heart
of
erisa,
and
that
which
the
funds
are
used
to
buy,
and
once
you
get
into
the
second
category,
the
question
of
whether
a
state
statute
relates
to
erisa
depends.
it
all
depends.
if
it's
pensions,
that's
just
money
that's
being
paid
out,
and
it
would
be
harder
for
the
state
to
survive.
if
it's
day-care
centers,
or
vacations,
that's
at
the
other
extreme,
very,
very
distant,
and
this
seems
more
like
the
other
extreme.
but
that
basic
distinction,
why
isn't
that
really
the
key
to
this?
