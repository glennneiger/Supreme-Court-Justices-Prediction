justice
david
h.
souter
but
those
are
the
ones
that
you
meant
by
unfunded?
you
spoke
of
unfunded
plans
a
moment
ago.
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
you
agree
that
if
you
were
simply
looking
at
the
phrase,
plan,
fund,
or
program,
you
really
couldn't
make
this
argument.
and
your
argument
depends
on
saying
you've
got
to
read
the
statute
whole.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
morash
recognized
that,
and
if
you
don't
read
it
whole
this
way,
in
effect
you
are
going
to
federalize
a
vast
area
of
state
activity
which
in
fact
has
nothing
to
do
with
the...
with
kind
of
the
gut
notion
of
administering
trust
funds.
justice
david
h.
souter
just
as
you
could--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wouldn't
it
mean
that
in
any
case
like
this,
for
example,
in
which
the
employer
in
effect
wanted
to
exempt
himself
from
the
apprenticeship
obligations
and
the
wage
differential
that
that
implies,
he
would
have
a
perfect
way
to
do
it
simply
by
agreeing
to
the
apprenticeship
scheme
as
part
of
his
contract,
then
funding
his
apprenticeship
scheme
with
a
trust
fund
like
this,
them
claiming
on
your
theory
that
all
of
the
state
regulations
on
apprenticeships
relate
to
the
plan
and
becoming
free
of
the
regulations?
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
perfect
ticket
to
an
exemption
from
what
he
had
agreed
to
if
he
thought
in
this
particular
instance
it
was
in
his
interest
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
under
existing
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that,
then,
leave
your
client
in
the
same
position
that
the
client
is
in
if
the
state
prevails
here,
except
that
he
would
be
in
that
position
as
a
result
of
the
enforcement
of
the
different
statute,
the
payroll
differential
statute
as
opposed
to
the
apprenticeship
scheme
under
the
contract?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he's
doing
it
for
the
purpose,
in
effect,
of
honoring
state
law
or
state
regulation
with
respect
to
apprentices
which
he
now
says
is
unenforceable
against
him
because
he's
funding
his
obligation
by
an
erisa
plan.
isn't
that
his
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
why
did
your
client
establish
the
erisa
plan?
the
erisa
plan
was
established
to
fund,
in
effect,
his
apprenticeship
obligations,
and
by
virtue
of
having
done
it
by
an
erisa
plan
he
now
claims
that
because
of
the
relating-to
language
there
is
a
preemption
which
exempts
him
from
the
state
law
that
he
established
the
fund
to
honor.
isn't
that
his
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
he
does
all
that,
and
after
he's
done
it,
for
whatever
reason,
he
says,
this
isn't
such
a
hot
idea.
i
don't
think
i
want
to
honor
the
apprentice
journeyman
wage
differential
for
whatever
reason,
and
i
can
get
out
of
it
by
claiming
an
erisa
preemption.
that
may
not
be
such
a
great
thing
for
me
in
the
long
run,
but
at
least
it
gets
me
out
of
the
situation
that
i'm
in
now
that
i
don't
like.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
be
in
the
same
position
if
the
reason
you
hadn't
gotten
the
approval
from
the
state
was,
or
if
the
reason
for
the
withholding
in
this
case
was
that
you
simply
hadn't
followed
the
plan.
you'd
be
in
the
same
position
you're
in
right
now,
and
you
would
be
claiming
preemption,
and
for
that
reason
you
would
be
claiming
the
illegality
of
withholding
the
wages.
justice
david
h.
souter
before
you
tell
me
about
the
safeguards--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
a
general
proposition
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it
easier
to
make
a
different
kind
of
classification
and
in
effect
respond
to
the
problem
that
justice
scalia
raised
that
in
theory
you
could
oust
any
state
regulation
by
forming
an
erisa
plan?
and
the
answer
to
the
classification
i
have
in
mind
is,
if
the
erisa
plan
is
in
fact
funding
what
is
a
requirement
of
a
traditional
area
of
state
regulation,
which
i
dare
say
apprenticeship
is,
the
regulation
of
day-care
centers
is,
and
so
on,
just
as
the
regulation
of
hospital
rates
could
be,
then
the
fact
that
there
is
an
erisa
plan
does
not
so
connect
the
plan
to
the
area
of
regulation
as
to
require
preemption.
why
isn't
that
the
answer
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
not
interfering
with
the
plan
if
the
object
of
the
plan
is
to
fund
whatever
you
are
required
or
permitted
to
do
by
or
consistent
with
the
traditional
state
regulation.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is
circular,
and
both
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
my
question
are
basically
saying,
there's
got
to
be
a
limit
to
what
is
connected
to
or
related,
and
that
limit
is
established
by
looking
for
certain
areas
of
traditional
state
regulation,
and
if
the
effect
on
the
erisa
plan
is
incidental
to
that
regulation,
as
it
would
be
when
a
plan
is
set
up
simply
to
fund
the
regulation,
then
you
don't
have
preemption.
why
isn't
that
the
answer?
why
isn't
that
the
key
to
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
can
you
say
it's
express
in
this
case
unless
you...
maybe
you
do...
say
that
there
cannot
be
such
a
thing
as
an
unfunded
plan
which
does
not
fall
under
erisa?
i
take
it
that
is
your
position.
every
plan,
even
unfunded
plans,
is
an
erisa
plan
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
that's
what
i
meant,
and
don't
you
have
trouble
under
morash?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
hill,
you
heard
counsel
for
the
state
say
that
there
are
without
question
unfunded
plans
out
there.
they
don't
happen
to
have
the
number.
but
i
take
it,
then,
you're
willing
to
accept
the
consequence
that
if
you're
right,
erisa
regulation
is
due
for
a
potentially
very
significant
expansion,
because
they're
not...
erisa
isn't
regulating
any
of
these
plans
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're...
i
mean,
erisa
has
not
been
doing
what
it
should
have
been
doing
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how?
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
it
be
quite
arbitrary
on
your
theory
to
limit
it
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
just
as
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
equally
arbitrary
to...
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
to
say
that
we'll
draw
the
line
before
erisa
gets
to
the
day-care
centers.
if
we
accept
your
theory,
we...
you
know,
we've
got
to
go
the
whole
hog.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
how?
how
do
we
do
it,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
on
day-care
centers
is
inevitable.
as
i
understand
you
correctly,
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
even
when
you
get
to
the
single
employer
schemes,
is
inevitable.
how
are
we
going
to
draw
this
line
that
you
want
us
to
draw?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let's
assume
that
you're
right
and
we
don't
draw
that
distinction.
let
me
then
go
to
the
last
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
and
say
that
it
then
follows
that
the
preemption
is
going
to
occur.
why
does
it
follow
that
preemption
is
going
to
occur,
whether
we're
talking
about
funded
or
unfunded
plans?
why
does
it
follow
that
preemption
is
going
to
occur
if
we
are
nonetheless
concededly
in
an
area
of
traditional
state
regulation
which
we
have
already
held
it
is
assumed
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
obliterate
under
the
guise
of
erisa?
why
does
the
preemption
follow?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
there
will
be
no
end
to
related
to,
that
if...
that
no
state
law
is
ever
going
to
survive,
whether
it
is
a
subject
of
traditional
state
regulation
or
not.
the
same
conclusion,
it
seems
to
me,
would
have
to
follow,
for
example...
assuming
there
were
no
distinction
between
funded
or
unfunded
plans,
the
same
conclusion
would
have
to
follow
with
respect
to
hospital
rate
regulations,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
your...
the
only
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
or
that
i'm
trying
to
understand
is
that
i
think
your
theory
of
preemption
does
not
accord
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
some
areas
of
state
regulation
which
do
not
regulate
trust
funds
as
such
are
traditional
areas
of
state
regulation
which
congress
presumably
did
not
intend
to
preempt,
and
i
think
your
argument
assumes
that
that
really
is
not
a
distinction
that
we
can
make.
