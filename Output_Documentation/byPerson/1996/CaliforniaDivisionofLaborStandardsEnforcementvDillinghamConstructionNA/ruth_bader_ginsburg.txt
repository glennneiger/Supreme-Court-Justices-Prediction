but
counsel,
how
do
you
deal
with
why
we're
here,
because
dillingham
said
we
are
having
funds,
our
funds
are
being
withheld
from
us.
that's
coercive,
not...
it's
not
that
you
can
do
this
if
you
like,
but
if
you
don't
do
it
you
won't
get
paid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
not...
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
you
are
not
agreeing
with
the
afl-cio
position
that
the
training
program
is
different
from
the
provision,
the
financial
arrangement
for
gaining
the
training,
so
that
the
training
program
itself,
as
distinguished
from
how
one
pays
for
it,
is
not
under
erisa.
you
seem
not
to...
you
and
the
government
both
seem
to
reject
that
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
other
cases
that
involve
services?
and
what's
peculiar
about
this,
it's
like
you
mention
day
care.
it's
not,
you
get
paid
a
pension
or
you
get
provided
with
a
health
insurance
package,
but
it's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any
other
case
that
addresses
that
like...
the
intera--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
does
erisa
have
any
standards
for
the
training
program
as
distinguished
from
the
funding
of
it?
does
it
have
standards
for
the
quality
of
the
trainers,
the
number
of
hours,
the...
erisa
doesn't
regulate
training,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they...
the
state
regulated
training
of
apprentices
long
before
there
was
a
fitzgerald
act,
and
it's
very
old
kind
of
state
regulation,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
definitions
section
mentions
along
with
apprentice
programs
day-care
centers
and
prepaid
legal
services.
training
programs
and
day-care
centers,
the
fact
that
it's
an
erisa
program
wouldn't
mean
that
the
quality
standards
imposed
on
day
care
by
the
state
are
removed,
would
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
that's
what...
i'm
struggling
with
this
statute
that
lists
them
in
a
row,
training
programs,
day-care
centers,
prepaid
legal
services,
and
at
least
it
seems
incredible
to
me
to
believe
that
you
could
set
up
a
day-care
center
and
escape
all
the
state
regulations,
quality
controls
on
that,
if
you
put
it
under
the
head
of
erisa,
so
why
should
it
be
different
for
training?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
a
training
program
that
the
employer
would
offer,
say,
that
we
need
to
have
a
healthy
workforce
so
we're
going
to
have
this
gym
facility,
this
health
club,
and
that's...
and
then
could
they
then
say
because
it's
under
erisa
we
want
to
be
relieved
of
all
these
state
requirements
that...
these
safety,
and
enough
space,
and
all
that,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
because
it's
an
erisa
plan
and
its
state
regulation
is
preempted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
say
a
group
of
employers
do
it.
they
get
together
and
they
say,
we're
going
to
have
this
facility,
and
all
our
workers
will
use
it,
and
we're
going
to
fund
it
out
of
a
plan,
and
so
state,
please
don't
tell
us
about
how
much
space
we
need
between
machines,
and
the
quality
of
what...
the
equipment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
could
happen,
certainly,
with
the
day
care,
which
is
in
that
same
string.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
legal
services?
they're
all
together,
and
if
you're
saying
that
they
can't
touch
training
because
it's
under
an
erisa
plan,
and
it's
listed
right
in
the
statute
as
such,
but
so
are
these
other
things,
so
why
would
training
be
more
untouchable
than
a
day-care
center,
prepaid
legal
services--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--my
health
club?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
day-care
centers
is
not
so
unusual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
without
leaving
out
the
fitzgerald
act,
it's
the
related
to.
it
was
in
your
colloquy
before
with
justice
souter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
let's
forget
about,
it's
a
plan.
it's
an
erisa
plan.
is--
