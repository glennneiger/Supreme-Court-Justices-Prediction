chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-789,
the
california
division
of
labor
standards
enforcement
v.
dillingham
construction
and
michael
arceo.
mr.
rea.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fitzgerald
act
is,
you
know,
i
think
precatory,
isn't
it,
kind
of
a
feel-good
type
of
thing
that
doesn't
really
impose
any
specific
legal
requirements
on
anybody?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because
that
section
1002.1,
when
it
defines
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan,
does
include
in
terms
apprenticeship
or
other
training
programs.
there's
no
way
to
get
around
that,
is
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rea.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
1002.1
defines
employee
welfare
benefit
fund.
where
does
the
secretary
get
the
statutory
authority
in
that
section
to
make
his
distinction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
basis
in
1002.1
does
the
secretary
rely
on
for
making
that
distinction,
because
it
does
seem
that
the
definition
covers
any
plan,
fund,
or
program.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
hill,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
what
would
be
the
reason
for
congress
wanting
to
regulate
under
erisa
an
unfunded
apprenticeship
plan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
congress'
concern
in
erisa,
granted,
you
repair
to
the
statute
to
determine
that
in
the
first
instance,
the
insolvency
and
failure
to
put
together
enough
financing
for
these
various
plans?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
disclose
about
an
unfunded
plan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
some
of
the
government's
argument
is
based
on
the
distinction
between
funded
and
unfunded
and,
of
course,
if...
you
would
win,
i
take
it,
if
we
adopted
that
approach
because
your
client's
plan
was
separately
funded.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
california
regulation
in
question
here
deal
at
all
with
the
way
the
apprenticeship
plan
is
funded?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
does
it
attempt
to
regulate
the
funding
itself,
the
way
the
employer
pays
in,
or
the
kind
of
reports
he
has
to
make
in
connection
with
what
he
pays
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
might
not
that
be
a
possible
distinction,
that
if
the
state
regulation
doesn't
deal
with
the
funding
aspect,
then
perhaps
it
doesn't
relate
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hill.
mr.
rea,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rea.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
