justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
your
analysis,
as
i
understand
it,
you
could
have
a
single
employer
setting
up
a...
an
apprentice
program
with
its
own
standards.
that
would
be
an
erisa
plan,
and
it
would
preempt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your...
i
think
that's
your
theory,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
genuine.
it
just
provides
standards
that
differ
from
those
that
california
and
the
secretary
of
labor
would
require.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
still
would
preempt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
only
problem
i
have
with
that
argument,
you
say
it's
the
same
whether
it's
a
single
employer
or
a
multiemployer
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
and
if
you
read
it
literally,
you're
dead
right.
i
mean,
we
said
that
in
the
vacation
case,
but
we
say
you
can't
read
this
statute
literally.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
that's
the
problem.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could...
this...
any
employer
could
preempt
all
the
health
regulations
for
day
care,
a
whole
host
of
state
regulations,
if
you
read
everything
literally.
but
you're
saying,
well,
maybe
we
don't
have
to
read
it
literally
when
we
get
to
day-care
centers,
but
then
why
do
we
have
to
read
it
literally
with
respect
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--apprentice
programs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
this
case
deals
with
the
character
of
the
training
and
the
compensation,
whether
you
can
pay
the
apprentice
less
than
the
prevailing
wage
and
all.
supposing
we
had
a
safety-related
problem
that
a...
that
the
state
required
wearing
helmets
on
the
construction
jobs
or
something
for
apprentices,
and
the
erisa
plan
said
no
such
thing
should
be
required,
would
the
preemption
apply
to
such
regulations
as
well,
in
your
view,
as
well
as
economic--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
they
say...
the
group
of
employers
drafted
an
apprenticeship
program
that
said
they
shall
wear
a
different
kind
of
safety
gear,
less
protective
of
the
employee
that
the
state
regulation
required.
would
that
preempt
the
state
regulation,
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
really
the
same
question,
i
think.
it's
safety
instead
of
money.
that's
the
difference.
and
i
don't
know
why
if
you
preempt
the
prevailing
wage
rate
you
don't
preempt
everything
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
don't
know
why
it
couldn't
be.
they
couldn't
say
they'd
have
to,
you
know,
take
special
care
with
people
who
are
unfamiliar
with
the
hazards
of
the
workplace,
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
about
morash.
you
don't
challenge
morash,
do
you?
you
don't
ask
us
to
reexamine
that
case,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
involves
pension...
i
mean,
apprentice
rather
than
vacation.
