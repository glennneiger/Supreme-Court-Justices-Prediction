what
do
you
mean
by
unfunded
again?
would
you
clarify
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rea,
come
back
to
the
preemption
question.
i
don't
understand
why
the
federal
government
cannot
continue
to
cooperate
with
the
states,
whether
or
not
this
particular
law
of
california
is
held
to
be
preempted.
all
that
the
act
requires
is
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
directed
to
cooperate
with
state
agencies
engaged
in
the
formulation
and
promotion
of
standards
of
apprenticeship.
it
seems
to
me
california
agencies
could
continue
to
set
forth
standards
of
apprenticeship.
the
only
question
is
whether
california
can
consistently,
with
erisa,
enforce
those
standards
by
excluding
erisa
plan
apprentices
from
state
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
formulate
and
promote
standards
by
simply,
for
instance,
prohibiting
any
company
from
calling
something
a,
quote
apprenticeship
program
unless
it
meets
certain
requirements,
which
is
a
good
deal
short
of
this.
that
would
promote
genuine
apprenticeship
programs
so
that
somebody
doesn't
enroll
in
a
program
which
really
doesn't
do
the
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
this
argument
requires
you
to
establish,
however,
that
not
all
apprenticeship
programs
are
erisa
plans.
is
there
some
basis
for
that,
other
than
the
funding-nonfunding
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
good
idea,
but
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
language
of
the
statute?
i
mean,
are
we
just
giving
up
on
the
term
relates-to,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
devising
distinctions
that
we
think
are
useful?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you're
saying,
even
though
they
use
different
terms,
plan,
fund,
or
program,
if
it's
an
apprenticeship
or
training
program,
it
also
has
to
be
a
fund?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
not
only
refers
to
programs,
it
refers
to
funds
separately.
justice
antonin
scalia
fund
or
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i'm
saying
if
you
win
this
case
that's
the
option
that
you're
going
to
have,
or
that
others...
i
don't
mean
that
your
client
is
going
to
do
it,
but
that's
an
option
that
other
contractors
would
have.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
of
course
it's
correct,
what
he
said.
not
whether
it's
going
to
open
the
floodgates,
but
is
it
correct?
it
seems
to
me
it
is.
isn't
your
response
that
you
could
create
such
a
hypothetical
with
respect
to
any
provision
that
could
be
preempted
by
erisa?
you
could
always
create
a
hypothetical
that
somebody
does
not
want
to
abide
by
the
state
law
in
question,
which
would
be
preempted,
need
only
set
up
an
erisa
plan.
isn't
that
your
response?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
would
be
preempted
by
erisa,
and
that
doesn't
relate
to
the
funding.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
call
it
that,
or
you
could
call
it
the
stick
of
not
being
able
to
participate
in
public
works
projects.
i
mean,
that's...
whether
it's
a
carrot
or
a
stick
is
surely
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder,
don't
you
think?
