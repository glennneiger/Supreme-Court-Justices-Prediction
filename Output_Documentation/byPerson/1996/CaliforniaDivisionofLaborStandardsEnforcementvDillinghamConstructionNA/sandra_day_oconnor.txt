justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
california
law
applicable
here?
does
it
operate
just
as
an
incentive
for
people?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it...
does
it
do
any
more
than
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
response
surprises
me
a
little.
i
would
have
thought
you
might
take
the
position
that
it
is
just
an
incentive,
and
therefore
there's
no
occasion
for
preemption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
you're
trying
to
respond
some
other
way.
i'm
baffled.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
state
you
want
to
say
it's
not
preempted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
california
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
one
way
to
say
it
is,
look,
this
is
just
an
incentive
that
we
have
for
people.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your
response
to
me
was,
oh,
no,
it's
not
an
incentive,
it's
something
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
anyone
who
opts
to
follow
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
this
court
speak
to
the
issue
in
part
in
massachusetts
v.
morash,
holding
that
a
state
law
impacting
solely
benefits
may
relate
to
an
erisa
plan,
if
they're
financed
by
a
separate
fund?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
would
be
pretty
much
contrary
to
the
afl-cio
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we'd
spoken
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
by
federal
funding
or
assistance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
are
you
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
if
the
employer
pays
out
of
his
own
general
funds
it's
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
the
difference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if--
--it
was
separately
funded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
the
government's
position
is
that
because
of
that,
there
is
no
preemption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
they
rely
in
part
on
this
court's
holding
in
morash
and
in
part
on
the
secretary
of
labor's
regulations
and
determinations,
is
that
right?
that's
how
they
draw
the
line--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--between
funded
and
unfunded.
now,
how
do
you
respond
to
the
reliance
on
the
secretary's
regulations
and
the
morash
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
at
bottom
you
say
the
statute,
the
erisa
statute
itself
does
not
permit
drawing
that
distinction
that
the
government
would
draw.
