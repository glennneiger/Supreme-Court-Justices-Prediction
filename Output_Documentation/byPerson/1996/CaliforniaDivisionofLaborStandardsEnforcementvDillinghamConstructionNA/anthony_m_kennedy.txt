justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
before
you
do
that,
could
you
tell
me,
counsel,
it
seemed
to
be
conceded
by
both
sides,
certainly
by
dillingham,
that
this
is
a
plan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
there
apprenticeship
programs
that
are
clearly
not
erisa
plans?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
those
exist,
or
is
this...
is
that
just
a
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
just
ask
this
further
question.
are
there
approved
and
registered--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--apprentice
programs
that
are
not
erisa
plans?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
easier
to
get
certification
if
you
do
have
funding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
thank
you.
that
was,
i
thought,
a
preliminary
that
helps
me
before
you
address
the
points
you
were
going
to
address.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
statute
refers
to
programs.
that
statute
refers
to
apprentice
programs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
you
must
give
a
different
meaning
to
the
word
program
in
the
first
part
of
the
clause
than
in
the
second
part
of
the
clause?
