mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
first
amendment
facial
overbreadth
case
involves
a
government
employee
who
wanted
to
write
her
official
documents
in
a
language
her
supervisor
did
not
understand.
even
if
her
choice
of
language
on
the
job
was
speech,
which
is
was
not,
it
was
the
government's
speech,
not
hers.
under
capital
square,
government
runs
no
risk
of
a
first
amendment
violation
when
it
restrains
its
own
speech.
official
english
statutes,
which
are
simply
restraints
on
the
government's
own
speech,
do
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
it's
a
political
choice.
one
point
was
not
treated
sufficiently
in
the
briefs.
last
term
in
county
commissioners
v.
umbehr,
a
government
contractors
case,
the
court
said
that
the
government's
interest
in
speech
depends
on
the
speaker's
proximity
to
government.
the
closer
to
government,
the
greater
the
government's
interest.
umbehr
described
a
speech
spectrum
ranging
from
private
citizens,
in
whose
speech
the
government
has
little
interest,
to
government
employees,
whose
closeness
to
government
means
that
the
government
is
very
interested
in
their
speech.
government
contractors
fell
somewhere
in
between
government
employees,
who
had
the
closest
relationship
to
government,
and
other
speakers
with
less
close
relationships,
and
though
not
said
in
umbehr,
since
government
is
actually
closest
to
itself,
government
speech,
the
government
speech
cases
would
be...
would
place
very
high
on
the
umbehr
speech
spectrum,
beyond--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--your
honor,
we
agree
with
the
attorney
general's
opinion
as
to
its
construction
of
article
xxviii
on
the
first
amendment
grounds.
we
also
agree
that
the
attorney
general
appropriately
considered
equal
protection
matters.
our
concern
is
that
the
attorney
general's
opinion
relied
on
a
case
which,
subsequent
to
the
opinion,
this
court
vacated
on
mootness,
and
that
was
an
equal
protection
issue.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
i
believe
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
said
that
the
next
attorney
general
could
issue
another
opinion
and
the
attorney
general's
opinion
was
not
binding
on
the
courts,
therefore
they
felt
that
they
still
had
a
viable
case,
and
the
district
court
disagreed
with
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
and
decided
not
to
abide
by
it,
as
did
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
she
was
at
no
risk
of
losing
her
job,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
although
that
was...
that's
the
correct
interpretation,
she
did
not
agree
with
that
and
asked
the
court
on
a
slightly
different
ground,
which
is
that
she
was
not...
excuse
me.
the
district
court
handed
down
a
decision
on
a
slightly
different
ground,
which
is
that
although
she
was
not
at
risk
from
losing
her
job,
it
decided
this
was
a
facial
overbreadth
case
and
felt
somehow
there
were
some
risk
to
other
government
employees
who
were
not
before
the
court.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
believe
the
district
court
was
wrong,
your
honor.
this
never
should
have
been
a
facial
overbreadth--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--your
honor,
the
central
point
of
mootness
is
whether
this
court's
decision
can
affect
the
legal
rights
of
the
parties
before
it.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
petitioners
have
standing
because
the
lower
court
decisions
affected
their
legal
rights.
they
have
legal
rights
created
by
the
state.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
aoe--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--in
footnote
17
of
diamond
v.
charles
the
court
noted
that
a
state
may
create
interest
the
invasion
of
which
would
give
standing
in
federal
court.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
the
state
created
an
interest
in
petition--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--your
honor,
diamond
v.
charles
as
i
read
it
is
predicated
on
the
ability
to
create
and
enact
a
legally
enforceable
code,
citing
snapp.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
well,
that
goes
back
to
the
standing
question
for
organizations,
your
honor.
there
are
two
ways
that
we
have
standing.
one
is
the
invasion
of
our
ability
to
go
into
state
court.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
the
statute...
the
citizens'
suit
provision
in
article
xxviii,
section
4
permits
any
person
or
organization
doing
business
in
arizona
to
enforce
article
xxviii
in
state
court.
that
would
not,
in
and
of
itself,
give
standing.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
it
is
a
state--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--because
the
federal
court
decision
eliminated
that
state
court
right.
it
would
be
the
equivalent
of
our
having
any
other
state
interest,
state
granted
interest
which
the
federal
court's
action
then
eviscerated.
we
would
have
the
right
to
come
to
federal
court
and
say,
we
fought
hard
for
that
right.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
think
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
because
we
are
the
proponents
and
we
expect...
it
was
our
court
purpose
to
get
that
right
under--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
question--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--the
senator--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--no,
your
honor,
the
senator
alone
probably
not,
but
the
legislative
body
itself
would
under
chadha,
and
i
think
that
that's
a
situation
where--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--not
quite
at
that
point,
your
honor.
what
chadha
says
is,
where
the
executive
branch
and
the
challenger
both
agree
that
the
provision
is
unconstitutional,
congress
was
the
appropriate
body
to
defend
the
statute.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
the
same
situation
applies
in
arizona,
where
the
arizona
constitution,
article
iv,
provides
that
the
voters
themselves
have
the
right
to
an
initiative,
and
this
is
a
matter
in
which
this
would
affect
the
voters'
right
of
initiative.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
no,
your
honor.
i'm
suggesting
that
in
certain
limited
circumstances
the
invasion
of
the
right
would
give
someone
standing
to
complain
about
it,
and
the
difference
is--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--your
honor,
the
invasion
of
the
right
is
the
elimination
of
the
right.
that
goes
to
the
injury
question,
the
prudential
question.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
individual
interest...
t
he
individual
injury
to
each
citizen
is
so
small
relative
to
everyone
else
that
there
is
no
differentiation,
but
to
the
initiative
proponent,
just
as
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
term
limits
case,
where
the
state
was
present,
just
as
the
state
is
present
here,
the
initiative
proponents
were
able
to
come
forward
and
make
their
best
case.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
that's
the
state's
position,
but
lower...
in
the
lower
courts
they
were
quite
clear
on
their
position
on
the
merits.
it's
only
when
they
came
to
this
court
that
they
brought
up
once
again
this
issue.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
i'm
sure
that's
true
as
to
the
interpretation
of
state
law,
but
not
necessarily
the
application
of
federal
law
to
state
law,
but
leaving
that
aside--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--i
think
the
courts
are
split
on
that,
your
honor.
i
know
the
arizona
position
is
that
they
are
not
bound,
but
there
are
cases--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--well,
your
honor,
as
to
us,
and
this
goes
to
our
own
unique
situation
and
why
we're
different
from
everyone
else--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--that's
our
concern,
your
honor
under--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--no,
your
honor.
we
attempted
to
intervene.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
we
were
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor.
in
the
939
fed.
2d
opinion,
yniguez
won.
we
were
permitted--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--well,
because
of
a
fairly
bizarre
application
of
2403(b),
we
were
the
only
group
that
the
court
designated
as
a
party.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
that's
correct.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
that's
correct.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
found
also,
and
we
did
receive
those
assurances.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
in
the
district
court
the
state's
position
was
completely...
was
the
same
as
ours.
they
argued
the
constitutionality.
they
argued
one
additional
factor,
which
was
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
ultimately
the
court,
the
district
court
accepted
their
eleventh
amendment
argument
but
rejected
their
constitutional
argument.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
unless
this
court
vacates
it,
or--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--your
honor,
if--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--i'm
sorry.
if...
since
the
state
attempted
to
intervene
in
the
district
court
level
under
2403(b)
and
was
reversed,
i
believe
that
the
appeal,
at
least
of
that
order,
is
still
properly
before
this
court,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--the
governor
was,
your
honor.
she...
and--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--she
did,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
if
we
have
no
standing,
and
the
argument
is
that
the
district
court's
opinion
stands,
then
you
will
have
in
essence
private
constitutional
review.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
believe
that's
also
the
position
of
the
states
in
its
briefs,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
i
think
there's
also
a
question--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--as
to
whether
there
was
ever
a
controversy
in
the
district
court,
your
honor?
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
believe
that
was
the
position
of
the
state
throughout
the
district
court--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--i'm
sorry.
the
state
was
a
party
until
december
21,
1988,
when
it
was
dismissed
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds,
and
then
the
complaint
was
refiled
without
the
state.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
believe--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--yes.
i
believe
the
answer
is
yes.
in
the
litigation
the
governor's
position,
as
articulated
by
the
attorney
general,
who
was
representing
all
the
parties
in
that--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--including
the
governor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
but
before--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--your
honor--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--the
attorney
general's
position
was,
both
prior
to
the
opinion
in
the
litigation,
that
there
was
no
threat
to
the
employee,
and
at
the
point
of
the
opinion
said,
in
essence,
there's
no--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--since
this
is
a
first
amendment
case,
your
honor,
what's
concerning
me
is
that
the
court
is
very
solicitous
towards
concerns
of
chilling
first
amendment
speech,
and
because
the--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--i
think
your
honor's
question
is
whether
you
would
need
a
realistic
threat
to
be
chilled.
i
think
a
perceived
threat
which
chills
speech
might
be--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--well--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
defendants
did
file
an
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
think
i
misspoke.
i
believe
the
defendants
did
not
file
an
answer
in
the--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
other
than
the
attorney
general's
representation,
her
own
personal
position,
your
honor?
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
although
the
attorney
general's
opinion
is
not
binding
on
the
courts--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--the
director
of
the
department
of
administration?
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
attorney
general's
opinion
power
as
under
ars
41-193
(a)
is
in
the
statute,
but
the
courts
have
decided
that
they're
not
binding
on--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--yes,
your
honor,
following
the
ninth
circuit
en
banc
opinion.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
yes.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
not
specifically,
but
she
had
asked
for
all
other
relief.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
which
is
what
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
also
said
that
ms.
yniguez--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--the
ninth
circuit
felt
that
she
had--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--the
right
to
ask
for
nominal
damages,
and
that
was
enough.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
think
what
they're
asking
is
that
she
could
ask
for
it.
it
was
the
request
and
the
expectation
rather
than
the--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--actually,
there
was
no
injunction
issued,
either.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
just
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
the
court
felt
that--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--i
think,
given
the
context,
my
proper
answer
should
be
yes,
but
i
think
my
answer's
actually
no,
your
honor,
because
i
think
what
it
was
suggesting
was
that
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
before
the
court
at
the
time
there
were
still
legal
rights
between
the
parties
before
the
court,
which
it
had
made
parties,
which
could
be
determined
by
the
court
on
the
facts
in
front
of
it.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i
think
under
the
eleventh
amendment
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
if--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
obviously,
our
preference
is
to
have
the
court
decide
the
merits,
since
we
believe
that
the
rights
of
petitioners
and
respondents
would
be
determined
at
that
point,
but
if
the
court
finds
that
this
case
was
moot,
either
from
the
start
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
then
clearly
we
would
ask
the
court
to
vacate
all
the
way
down.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
i'd
like
to
point
the
court's
attention
to
the
rulings
of
the
two
lower
courts
on
this
case.
in
the
petition
appendix,
page
112,
113a,
the
order
of
the
district
court
says,
it
is
further
ordered
that
article
xxviii
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
arizona
is
hereby
declared
to
be
void
as
being
invalid
on
its
face
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
on
page
60a
of
the
same
appendix,
the
ninth
circuit
en
banc
decision
says,
we
affirm
the
district
court's
judgment
that
article
xxviii
of
the
arizona
constitution
is
facially
overbroad
and
violates
the
first
amendment,
and
that
the
article
is
unconstitutional
in
its
entirety.
i
think
that
is
the
heart
of
the
matter
here,
your
honors.
petitioners
are
bound
by
the
lower
court
judgment
because
they
intervened
as
a
party.
if
article
xxviii
is
void
in
its
entirety,
then
petitioners
do
not
have
the
enforcement
rights
that
the
court
suggests
that
they
do.
in
addition,
on
the
question
of
who
defends
the
actions,
i
think
in
this
case
the
attorney
general
attempted
to
defend,
and
because
of
the
application
of
2403(b)
in
this
case
the
attorney
general
and
the
state's
rights
under
the
eleventh
amendment
were
implicated
because--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--it
would
also
wipe
out
the
district
court
opinion.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
your
honor,
the
problem
with
the
hypothetical
is
that
this
is
not
a
standard
contract
case
or
an
employment
problem
case.
this
is
a
facial
overbreadth
first
amendment
attack
on
a
state
constitution
which
was
held
to
be
void
in
its
entirety.
this
is
not
just
ms.
yniguez
and
the
governor.
the
court
has
held
that
judgments
have
a
value
in
and
of
themselves.
people
rely
on
them.
we
cannot
go
into
state
court--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--but,
your
honor,
the
problem
is,
if
we
go
into
state
court
and
say,
sue
anyone
in
the
state,
the
defense
by
everyone
is,
the
district
court
for
arizona
has
held
this
statute...
this
constitutional
provision
unconstitutional
in
its
entirety.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
but
it
does--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--it
doesn't
bind
it
in
the
sense
that
it's
automatically
controlling,
but
in
a
number
of
cases...
fdic
v.
jennings,
i
think
in
the
tenth
amendment--
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
--it's
the
prospect
of
an
unfavorable
precedent
looming
over
the
case
to
the
extent
that
a
state
court
judge
is
going
to
say,
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
am
i
going
to
apply
federal
law
to
this
question
differently
than
the
district
court
of
arizona?
i
would
find
that
a
prospect
that
would
be
daunting
for
a
litigant.
mr.
barnaby
w.
zall
no.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
only...
i
think
there's
four.
