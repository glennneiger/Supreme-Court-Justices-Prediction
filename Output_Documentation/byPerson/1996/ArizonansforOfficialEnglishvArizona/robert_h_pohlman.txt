mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
state
of
arizona
determined
in
its
exercise
of
it
sovereign
judgment
that
it
would
not
join
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
and
that
it
would
not
appeal
the
final
judgment
in
ms.
yniguez'
favor
for
nominal
damages
in
the
district
court,
this
case
became
one
without
an
article
iii
case
for
controversy
and
should
have
concluded.
we
would
ask
that
this
court
dismiss
the
petition
because
the
petitioners
lack
standing
to
maintain
this
action
in
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
it
wasn't
moot
for
a
number
of
reasons,
justice
scalia,
one
of
which
is
that
there
was
a
final
unappealed
judgment
in
favor
of
the...
ms.
yniguez
against
governor
mofford,
so
that
judgment
was
binding
and
final
long
before
she
left
state
employment.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
in
the
district
court
there
was
a
case
or
controversy
initially
because,
as
a
factual
matter,
the
district
court
found
that
ms.
yniguez
had
suffered
an
injury
in
fact
in
that
she...
her
first
amendment
rights
had
been
chilled.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
the
governor
agreed
after
the
judgment,
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
that
it
was
invalid.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
there...
i
don't
recall,
justice
o'connor,
whether
there
was
an
answer.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
i
don't
recall
if
there
was
or
not.
i
tend
to
believe
there
was
an
answer
because
the
case
went
on
for
so
long
below,
and
actually
went
to
trial.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
there
was...
justice
kennedy,
there
was
no
specific
indication.
however,
there
was
a
finding
that
governor
mofford
intended
to
enforce
the
article,
that
she
expected
government
employees
to
enforce
the
article
and
to
comply
with
the
article,
and
that
therefore
ms.
yniguez
had
a
chilling
effect
on
her
first
amendment
rights
that
was
caused
by
governor
mofford,
and
that's
found
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
pages
102
and
103.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
it
was
governor
mofford's
outspoken
indication
that
she
intended
to
enforce
article
xxviii,
and
that
she
expected
government
employees
to
comply.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
first,
mr.
chief
justice,
ms.
yniguez
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
that
particular
attorney
general's
opinion
until
some
3-1/2
months
after
this
litigation
was
commenced,
so
for
that
3-1/2
month
period
of
time,
her
rights
were
obviously
chilled.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
it
doesn't,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
in
the
case
of
the
attorney
general's
opinion
below,
that
opinion
was
found
to
be
nonbinding.
the
district
court
judge
recognized
that
the...
a
different
attorney
general
may
well
have
a
different
opinion.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
the...
it
was
not
binding
on
any
court.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
it
was
binding--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--my
understanding,
justice
souter,
is
that
it
would
be
binding
on
those
lower
administrative
employees,
including
catherine
eden,
who
was
one
of
the
defendants
who
was--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--in
the
record,
justice
souter,
the
governor
always
said
that
she
would
enforce
the
article
until
such
time
as
the
judgment
was
entered
by
the
district
court.
at
that
time,
she
indicated
she
did
not
intend
to
appeal,
but
she
also
thought
it
was--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--that's
not
my
understanding,
justice
souter.
that
language
was
included
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
which
was
in
january,
of
course,
after
the
lawsuit
had
been
initiated,
and--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--yes,
your
honor,
before
judgment
was
reached
and
before
trial,
and
at
the
trial
the
district
court
judge
determined
that,
notwithstanding
that
attorney
general's
opinion,
given
what
governor
mofford
had
said
in
public,
and
given
the
immediacy
of
the
chilling
effect
on
ms.
yniguez'
rights,
that
there
was,
in
fact,
an
injury
in
fact
to
her,
notwithstanding
that
opinion,
and
that
is
why
he
entered
the
declaratory
relief--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
what
we
do
is,
we
look
at
the
bonner
mall
partnership
case,
and
we
find
that
vacatur
is
an
equitable
doctrine.
if
we
look
at
the
equities
as
to
what
occurred
first
in
the
district
court,
there
was
no
appeal
by
the
governor.
it
was
a
final
unappealed
judgment
long
before
ms.
yniguez
left
government
service.
therefore,
that
judgment,
in
our
view,
cannot
be
vacated
under
bonner
mall
partnership.
but
if
you
look
at
the
equities
with
respect
to
the
ninth
circuit,
at
the
time
that
that
judgment
was
entered,
mr.
zall's
group
and
the
attorney
general
sought
to
intervene
for
purposes
of
taking
an
appeal
of
the
judgment
at
that
time.
ms.
yniguez
had
no
reason
at
that
juncture
to
appeal
her
claim
for
nominal
damages
because
the
district
court
said
we
will
not
allow
this
judgment
to
be
appealed.
no
one
has
an
interest
to
appeal
it.
it
is
going
to
stop
right
here.
and
so
all
that
was
on
appeal--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--no,
your
honor.
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
deny
the
motions
of
mr.
zall's
group,
arizonans
for
official
english,
and
the
attorney
general,
to
intervene
for
the
purpose
of
taking
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
exactly.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
that
is
exactly--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
i...
yes
and
no,
and
the
reason
i
answer
it
that
way,
justice
ginsburg,
is
because
they
were
permitted
to
intervene
under...
and
i
would
share
mr.
zall's
view
that
it's
kind
of
a
bizarre
application
of
28
u.s.c.
2403(b),
but
the
attorney
general
is
permitted
to
intervene
for
the
purpose
of
arguing
the
constitutionality
of
the
amendment.
that
statute
provides
that
the
attorney
general
may
do
so
or
the
state
may
do
so
and
has
all
the
rights
and
obligations
of
a
party,
but
they're
not
exactly
a
party,
although
they
have
all
rights
and
obligations,
including
the
right
to
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
justice
ginsburg,
that's
the
state's
position
of
the
day,
although
their
position
has
never
been
consistent
throughout
this
litigation.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
justice--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--justice
scalia,
she
could
have
appealed
at
that
juncture.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
we
did
not
ask
for--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--we
did
not
ask
for
nominal
damages
in
the
district
court
at
the
initial
phase.
we
asked
for
all...
anything
that
might
be
just
and
equitable
in
premises
in
a
traditional
addendum
clause.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
is--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--with
respect
to
damages?
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
i
don't
recall
that
being
in
the
judgment.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
mr.
chief
justice,
they
are
still
using
that
language
in
arizona,
and
what
occurred,
really,
is
the
ninth
circuit
said,
because
we
had
requested
at
the
time
that
if
it
goes
back,
and
if
there
ever
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
on
the
merits,
which
there
had
not
been
previously,
there
had
only
been
an
appeal
that...
a
procedural
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
zall
and
his
group
and
the
attorney
general
could
intervene,
because
up
to
that
point
in
time
ms.
yniguez
had
a
declaratory
judgment
in
her
favor.
she
had
no
reason,
as
long
as
the
actual
judgment
was
not
in
jeopardy,
to
go
and
ask
the
district
court
to
spend
the
time
to
get
$1
in
nominal
damages.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
she
was
asking
for
a
judgment
of
nominal
damages
in
her
favor
based
upon
the
rights
that
she
had...
had
been
found
to
have
been
violated
in
the
district--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--we
don't
believe
so,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
state
at
that
point
in
time
was
still
in
the
case
as
an
intervenor
under
2403(b).
in
fact,
the
state
actively
opposed
the
nominal
damages
cross-appeal,
filed
its
own
appeal
with
respect
to
procedural
aspects
of
the
case,
and
later,
after
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
for
the
purpose
of
award
of
nominal
damages,
or
at
least
entered
its
decision,
the
state
expressly
waived
its
right,
or
its
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
within
30
days
of
the
first
appeal
on
the
merits,
by
either
of
the--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--yes--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
for
purposes
of
damages?
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
i
think--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--it's
my
understanding
that
under
the
ex
parte
young
doctrine
there
can
be
an
award
of
nominal
damages,
and
i
don't
have
the
case
before
me.
i
would
be
happy
to
submit
a
letter
brief,
justice
o'connor,
if
that
would
assist
the
court,
but
in
any
event
what
occurred
was
the
nominal
damages
were
awarded
in
the
face
of
an
express
waiver
of
immunity
by
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
that
would
be
on
page
32
of
our
appendix
in
ms.
yniguez'
brief,
which
is
the
letter
from
the
attorney
general,
at
that
point
in
time
grant
woods.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
yes.
our
appendix
in
the
brief
on
the
merits,
justice
o'connor.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
believe
that
we
properly
have
damages
awarded
for
$1
and
proper
damages
were
awarded.
the
judgment
in
fact
was
entered
in
november
of
last
year,
and
that
can
be
found
at
page
211
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
that's
quite
accurate.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
follow
normally
under
munsingwear
if,
in
fact,
there
had
been
no
judgment
for
nominal
damages,
that
had
not
been
appealed
and
had
actually
been
expressly
waived,
that
judgment
by
the
state,
and
they
had
opposed
that
all
the
way
through
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
decided
after
that
judgment
was
entered
to
eschew
a
judicial
review
of
that.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
no,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
not
say
that.
i
would
say
that
that
is
one
of
the
aspects
of
this
case
upon
which
we
hang
our
hat
for
purposes
of
case
or
controversy.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
absent
the
nominal
damages
under
normal
circumstance,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
would
be
the
case.
however,
here
we
have
a
first
amendment
overbreadth
case,
and
to
add
to
some
of
the
procedural
dilemma
below
at
the
time
the
suggestion
of
mootness
was
made
by
the
solicitor
general
who
replaced
the
original
solicitor
general
in
the
case,
we
had
at
that
time
pending
an
appeal
by
state
senator
jaime
gutierrez,
whose
appeal
unfortunately
got
lost
in
the
docketing
system
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
it
was
agreed--
[laughter]
it
was
agreed
between
the
parties,
and
we
can
find
this
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
it
was
agreed
between
the
parties
at
that
point
in
time,
that
being
the
state
and
ms.
yniguez
and
aoe,
that
if
the
matter
were
to
be
remanded
for
consideration
on
the
merits,
then
the
appeal
of
senator
gutierrez
would
also
be
joined
with
it.
that
never
occurred
for
reasons
which
are--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--senator
gutierrez
was
a
state
legislator
at
the
time.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
i
would
say
he
had
much
greater
standing
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--senator
gutierrez
would
not
have
voted
for
this,
justice
stevens.
he's
bilingual
and
a
state
legislature
who
often
communicated
with
his
constituents--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--i
would
expect
he
voted
against
it.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
a
state
legislator
whose
conduct
was
threatened
by
article
xxviii
in
that
he
routinely,
as
many
state
legislatures...
legislators
do,
communicated
with
his
constituents
during
the
performance
of
government
business
in
languages
other
than
english.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
once
it
gets
to
that
point
in
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
anyone
defends
the
action.
i
think
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
defend
that
action
and
indeed,
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
in
that
event
i
would
suggest
to
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
voters
who
passed
the
initiative
would
probably
change
the
administration
when
they
next
went
to
the
polls.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
in
our
view,
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
there
is,
indeed,
an
enforcement
provision
in
the--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--anyone
who
desires,
i
believe,
your
honor,
to
enforce
the
provisions.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
your
honor,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
a
citizens
suit
provision
in
an
initiative
like
this
would
give
any
citizen
of
the
state
of
arizona
then
carte
blanche
under
article
iii
to
challenge
a
declaration
by
the--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--you're
right,
in
state
court
they
could
challenge
it,
and
that
challenge
would
still
be
viable
today.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
that's
accurate,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
may
be
true
with
respect
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
governor.
my
understanding
of
the
enforcement
provision
is
it
was
directed
at
administrative
employees
or
anyone
that...
a
citizen
or
person
doing
business
in
the
state--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--it
was
simply
a
declaratory
judgment.
there
was
no
injunction,
injunctive
relief
granted,
justice--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--i
would
espouse
that
argument
to
oppose
vacating
the
district
court
order,
exactly.
justice,
souter,
i
believe
that
the
attorney
general,
though,
had
a
slightly
different
position
insofar
as
the
ninth
circuit
is
concerned.
the
attorney
general
actively
sought
to
reinsert
himself
as
a
party
for
the
purposes
of
pursuing
the
appeal
with
or
without
aoe
when
they
were
in
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
they
appealed
within
the
time
frame
that
was
necessary
in
order
to...
had
they
been
granted
leave
to
intervene.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
exactly.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
justice
souter,
we
would
disagree
with
that
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
have
been
said
before,
but
in
fact,
and
this
goes
back
again
to
the
ruling
by
the
ninth
circuit
with
regard
to
2403(b),
in
fact
you're
entitled
to
intervene
as
the
state,
not
as
a
party,
but
with
all
the
rights
and
obligations
of
a
party
at
that
point
in
time,
and
the
district
court
recognized
there
is
no
right
to
intervene
at
that
point,
or
at
least
felt
that
way.
the
ninth
circuit
gave
them
a
right
which
is
not
contemplated
by
the
statute,
which
was
a
defendant
standing
under
2403(b),
and
i...
and
for
purposes
of
your
question
i'm
not
so
sure
that
was
legally
correct,
but
that
was
the
understanding
the
state
had,
that
they
were
in
there
with
defendants--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--and
that
was
the
position...
they
never
appealed
that
particular
ruling,
and
that
was
the
way

pohlman
--i--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--you
will
find
the
testimony
in
our
appendix
attached
to
our
brief
on
the
merits
at
pages
14
and
15,
which
is
the
testimony
of
ms.
yniguez
concerning
her
fear
that
she
may
be
prosecuted,
or
that
there
may
be
a
citizens
suit
based
upon
the
test
of
article
xxviii.
you
will
find
the
judge's
conclusion
on
page
102a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
where
he
finds
that
in
fact
ms.
yniguez
has
suffered
an
injury
in
fact
due
to
the
threat
of
potential
disciplinary
action
by
virtue
of--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--that
is
in
the
stipulated
facts
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
i
believe.
if
not,
they
may
be
in
our
appendix
beginning
at
pages
5
and
6.
i
don't
have
that
right
in
front
of
me,
but
i
can
find
that
for
you,
justice
breyer.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
the
cross-appeal
for
the
denial
of
nominal
damages
occurred
shortly
after
the
first
appeal
on
the
merits
was
ever
filed
by
any
intervenor,
and
that
was
after
the
case
had
been
remanded,
following
the
decision
on
the
suggestion
of--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--it
was
the
first--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--the
original
appeal
was
not
on
the
merits,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
that's
why
the
cross-appeal
we
are
not
entitled
to
unless
there
are...
we
don't
need
to
cross-appeal
on
the
judgment
unless
there
is
actually
an
appeal
on
the
judgment.
there
was
none
until
it
was
remanded.
that's
the
first
time
a
notice
of
appeal
on
the
judgment
itself
was
ever
filed
under
pellegrino
v.
nesbit.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
there's
anything
that
says
that
per
se.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
in
our
appendix
at
page
8
to
our
brief
on
the
merits
some
of
the
stipulations
appear.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
red
brief.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
page
8
of
our
appendix
shows
some
of
the
stipulations
pertaining
to
what
occurs
in
the
disciplinary
process.
the
testimony
below
was
ms.
yniguez
had
seen
people
disciplined
before,
that
she
understood
that
she
was
expected
to
comply--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--not
under
this
statute,
no.
people
were
disciplined
for
failing
to
follow
the
laws
of
the
state
or
the
constitution
of
the
state--
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
--that
they
would
be
disciplined
for
that,
and
that's
what
we
agreed,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
scarcely
surprising.
that's
why
she
was
in
fear
of
her
job.
mr.
robert
h.
pohlman
yes,
it
did,
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
district
court
found,
that
she
had
a
reasonable
belief
that
she
may
be
disciplined
if
she
in
fact
spoke
something
other
than
english
on
the
job.
