chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-974,
arizonans
for
official
english
and
robert
d.
park
v.
arizona.
mr.
zall,
and
let
me
request
of
you,
mr.
zall,
and
also
of
your
colleague
that
the
court
is
very
interested
in
hearing
a
full
discussion
of
the
issues
relating
to
standing,
mootness,
and
jurisdiction,
so
we
hope
you'll
devote
a
substantial
part
of
your
arguments
to
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
the
reason
that
you
didn't
because
you
thought
that
the
state
was
going
to
defend
the
provisions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
our
bankcorp
decision
it
seems
to
me
that
even
though
we
were
to
conclude
you
have
no
standing,
that
does
not
mean
we
would
simply
dismiss
the
petition
for
certiorari
if
we
find
that
there
was
a
defect
further
below,
that
there
was...
either
controversy
either
had
become
moot,
or
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
in
the
first
place.
this
court
would
then
have
the
authority
to
vacate
the
opinions
below,
i
believe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
zall.
mr.
pohlman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
for
that
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
view
of
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
enforcement
of
it
does
not
seem
to
have
a
realistic
prospect
of
any
effect
on
ms.
yniguez.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
they
were
chilled
for
3-1/2
months
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
unchilled,
the
lawsuit
doesn't
go
ahead
on
the
basis
of
what
was
the
case
earlier,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
a
district
court
prevent
someone
from
appealing?
i
can
see
how
the
court
of
appeals
could
say
there
is
no
interest,
but
what
did
the
district...
did
the
district
court
enter
some
sort
of
an
order
that
they
couldn't
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whose
has?
yes,
that's
for
sure.
[laughter]
mr.
pohlman,
i
don't
understand
why
you
said
it
was
okay
for
your
client
not
to
appeal
the
denial
of
nominal
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
such
other
relief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
such
other
relief
as
may
seem
just
and
proper...
are
they
still
using
that
language
in
arizona
complaints
+/?
that's
good
enough
to
keep...
to
leave
the
question
open
for
the
district
court,
but
when
the
district
court
at
the
end
of
the
case
does
not
grant
nominal
damages,
then
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
a
much
different
question.
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
send
the
thing
back
and
say
you
could
have
asked
for
nominal
damages
seems
extraordinary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position,
mr.
pohlman,
is
that
aoe
has
no
standing
here,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
does
that
leave
people
who
vote
and
perhaps
organize
to
get
a
referendum
passed.
typically
the
arizona
constitutional
convention,
one
of
the
reasons
for
referendum
was
that
you
couldn't
get
something
through
the
legislature
because
of
special
interests,
so
let
the
people
do
it.
the
referendum
passes,
and
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
hypothetically
say,
you
know,
we
don't
like
this
thing,
we're
not
going
to
defend
it.
who
then
defends
the
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
don't,
though?
i
mean,
they
say
we
don't
like
the
bill.
we're
just
going
to
let
it
go.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
way
for
anybody
to
come
in
and
defend
the
initiative
if
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
won't
do
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
citizens
suit
provision
may
come
up
against
a
barrier
if
there's
previously
been
an
action
in
the
federal
court
where
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
are
enjoined
from
enforcing
it,
which
went
by
default,
so
the
attorney
general
and
the
governor
would
then
have
a
perfectly
good
defense
to
the
citizens
suit
provision
of
res
judicata
as
a
result
of
the
federal
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
red
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
in
your
red
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page
8?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
disciplined
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
scarcely
surprising.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
question
is,
did
the
enactment
of
this
law
put
her
in
fear
of
her
job.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pohlman.
mr.
zall,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
six
in
phoenix
and
three
in
tucson.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zall.
the
case
is
submitted.
