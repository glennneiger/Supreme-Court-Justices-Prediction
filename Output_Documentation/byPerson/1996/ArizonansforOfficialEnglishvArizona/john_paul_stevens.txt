justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
status
of
the
case?
i
take
it
the
defendants
never
filed
an
answer,
or
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
including
the
defendant
catherine
eden?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
of
the
defendants
was
catherine
eden,
the
director
of
the
department
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
was
her
position
ever
made
known
formally
of
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
what...
in
your
judgment
what
we
should
do
with
the
case?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
must
have
a
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
represent
a
client
before
us.
[laughter]
and
i'm
curious
to
know
what
your
position,
independent
of
all
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
of
you--
--perhaps
we
could
have
it
printed
in
a
casebook
on
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
was
his
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
had
the
same
standing
as
the
petitioner
does
here,
in
other
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
voted
for
this
measure?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
he
voted
against
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what...
again,
what
is
his
standing?
