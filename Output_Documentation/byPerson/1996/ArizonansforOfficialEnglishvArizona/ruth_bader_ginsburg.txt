justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
zall,
this
particular
government,
at
least
the
attorney
general,
long
before
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court
said
that
the
constitutional
provision
in
arizona
did
not
prohibit
the
use
of
a
language
other
than
english
where
necessary
to
assure
the
fairness
and
effectiveness
of
the
delivery
or
services
to
members
of
the
public.
why
didn't
that
end
this
controversy?
the
then
plaintiff,
the
sole
plaintiff
in
effect
got
all
the
relief
that
she
sought,
which
was
the
assurance
that
she
wouldn't
be
fired
if
she
used
a
language
other
than
english
where
necessary
to
assure
the
fair
delivery
of
her
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
attorney
general
withdraw
that
opinion
as
the
official
interpretation
of
the
state's
executive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
the
law
as
far
as
the
executive's...
as
far
as
official
government
in
arizona
is
concerned,
so
my
question
is,
why
didn't
this
case
end?
wasn't
it
moot
at
that
point?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is...
it's
not
a
question
of
what
the
district
court
independently
might
think
the
law
was.
the
question
was,
was
the
plaintiff
at
any
risk
of
losing
her
job
when
the
official
interpretation,
the
state's
interpretation,
was
that
what
she
was
doing
was
all
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
didn't...
what
controversy
was
left,
then,
if
she
was
at
no
risk
of
losing
her
job?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
state
was
present
making
the
argument
on
the
merits,
but
here
we
don't
have
that.
i
think
the
state
is
telling
us
this
case
is
moot,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
this
court
is
bound
by
a
case
or
controversy
requirement,
and
the
state
is
acknowledging
that
that
no
longer
exists.
you
did
say
one
thing,
mr.
zall,
that
puzzled
me,
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
you
said
that
you
were
now
disabled
because
the
federal
court
had
eliminated
your
right,
but
it
was
not
my
understanding
that
a
district
court
or
a
court
of
appeals
is
a
higher
authority
on
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law
than,
say,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think...
is
the...
are
the
arizona
state
courts
bound
by
what
the
ninth
circuit
thinks
federal
constitutional
law
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's...
since
that
is
the
position
of
the
state
courts
in
your
state,
then
nothing
has
been
eliminated
by
anything
that
a
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
not
a
party
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
denied
your
motion
to...
your
post
judgment
motion
to
intervene,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
didn't
seek
to
enter
the
litigation
before
the
judgment
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
after
the
attorney
general
took
a
position
with
which
i
gather
you
disagreed
about
the
narrowness
of
the
provision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
state
meaning
government,
because
it's
hard
to
tell
who
is
the
state
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would...
and
then
the
governor,
as
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
state,
did
she
ever
take
a
position
in
opposition
to
the
plaintiff--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
including
the
governor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
well
before
judgment
was
reached
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
view
that
there
should
be
no
vacation
of
any
decision,
not
the
ninth
circuit's,
and
if
that
is
your
view,
how
can,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
ninth
circuit
when
the
plaintiff
was
no
longer
in
the
state's
employ
and
before
the
ninth
circuit
reached
its
judgment,
how
can
you
defend
keeping
that
judgment
on
the
books?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you're
saying
is
no
one
who
was
then
in
the
lawsuit
was
interested
in
appealing.
we
had
the
plaintiff
and
the
governor,
and
that's
it,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
only
after
final
judgment
was
entered
with
respect
to
those
two
parties
that
additional
people
asked
to
come
in,
one
aoe
and
the
other
the
attorney
general.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
district
court
said
no,
i
deny
your
motion,
your
post
judgment
motion
to
intervene.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
first
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
reverse
that
denial
as
to
aoe,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
what
the
district...
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
concerning
the
attorney
general
i'm
not
altogether
clear.
was
the
attorney
general,
in
your
view,
a
party
in
the
case
at
the
appellate
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state's
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
case
became
moot
when
the
plaintiff
left
the
state's
employ,
and
that
happened
before
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pohlman,
i
take
it
you
are
recognizing
that
the
attorney
general
was
a
proper
party
adverse
to
you
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
gather
that
from
footnote
10
on
page
23
of
your
brief.
you
seem
to
say
there
that
while
you
have
consistently
argued
that
aoe
has
no
standing,
that
doesn't
require
vacating
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
because
the
state
has
standing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
if
that's
so,
the
state's
position
here
is
that
the
case
is
moot,
at
least
when
the
plaintiff
left
the
employ
of
the
state
of
arizona.
when
mootness
occurs
in
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
isn't
munsingwear
the
rule
that
we
follow?
the
state
is
an
appellant.
it
says,
we
have
no
responsibility
for
the
plaintiff
leaving
the
employ.
we
didn't
get
a
chance
to
get
appellate
review,
so
the
district
court
decision
has
to
be
vacated.
if
the
state
is
legitimately
a
party,
as
you
seem
to
concede
on
appeal,
doesn't
that
follow?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
hanging
everything
on
that
$1
of
nominal
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
else
is
there?
let's
leave
out
the
$1
nominal
damages.
we
have
a
case
that's
a
perfectly
good
final
judgment.
we
have
an
appellant
that
you
concede
is
a
proper
appellant,
the
state.
the
case
becomes
moot
through
no...
nothing
that
the
appellant
has
done
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
isn't
our
normal
practice
in
that
situation
to
vacate
the
district
court's
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
attorney
general's
position
is,
wisdom
has
come
a
little
late,
but
now
the
attorney
general
is
enlightened
and
understands
that
long
before
any
judgment
was
entered
in
the
ninth
circuit
the
case
was
moot,
so
if
we
accept
that,
that
wipes
out
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
no
authority
to
issue
a
judgment
in
a
moot
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
necessarily,
because
if
the
mootness
occurred
on
appeal,
you
don't
ordinarily
wipe
out
a
final
judgment
from
which
no
party
to
that
judgment
has
appealed.
if
we
had
a
lawsuit
with
two
parties
at
the
end
of
the
road,
neither
pursued
an
appeal
in
the
district
court,
and
then
we
have
quite
different
lawsuit
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
state
is
telling
us
as
to
that
lawsuit
mootness
occurred
before
the
judgment,
how
do
you
reach
back
and
say,
but
the
mootness
also
affects
the
original
suit
and
that
original
judgment
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
governor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can't
rely
on
a
judgment
that's
vacated,
and
the
federal
court
has
no
authority
to
deal
with
anything
that
isn't
a
genuine
controversy
at
the
time
judgment
was
entered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
my
understanding
that
a
district
court's
judgment
doesn't
necessarily
bind
even
another
district
judge
in
the
same
district.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
does
it
bind
a
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
like
a
law
review
article,
isn't
it?
