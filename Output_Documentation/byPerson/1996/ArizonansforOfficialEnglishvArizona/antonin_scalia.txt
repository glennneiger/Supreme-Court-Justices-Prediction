justice
antonin
scalia
would
a
senator
who
sponsors
a
bill
have
standing
to
challenge
a
court's
evisceration
of
the
bill
after
it's
been
adopted
as
a
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
ground
that
he's...
you
know,
it's
my
bill.
it
was
my
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
clear
that
where
the
courts
misinterpret
a
statute
the
congress
that
passed
the
statute
has
standing
to
challenge
the
court's
interpretation
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
the
plaintiffs
can
sue
in
federal
court.
i
mean,
i
assume
what
you're
worried
about
is
that
any
state
employee
who
doesn't
want
to
abide
by
this
provision
would
simply
bring
a
1983
action
in
state
court...
in
federal
court,
and
the
federal
district
court
at
least
would
be
bound
by
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
would
apply
the
opinion
that
you
don't
agree
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
were
to
find
that
your
organization
does
not
have
standing
here,
i
guess...
and
for
that
reason
dismiss
the
case,
i
guess
the
consequence
would
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
would
stand,
because
you
just
came
in
at
this
last
stage,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
attempted
to
intervene,
but
you
were
not
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
were
other
parties
on
your
side
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
get
back
to
the
point
i'm
concerned
about.
if
you
don't
have
standing
here,
the
decision,
at
least
of
the
district
court,
remains
in
effect,
isn't
that
right,
because
you...
your
standing
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
district
court
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
we
vacate?
they
were
proper
parties.
if
we
take
the
ground
that
you're
not
a
proper
party
here,
nor
were
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court
judgment
would
still
stand.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
governor
was
a
party
in
the
district
court,
wasn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
chilled
if
there's
a
threat.
you're
not
chilled
if
there's
no
threat.
i
mean,
that's...
don't
you
need
a
threat
to
be
chilled?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
an
unrealistic
threat--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
chills
you?
wouldn't
an
unrealistic
threat
produce
an
unrealistic
chill?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
not
much
use
being
an
attorney
general,
i
would
guess,
if
your
opinions
on
the
law
are
not
binding
on
the
other
executive
officers.
you
might
as
well
not
have
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
they're
not
binding
on
the
courts,
i've
no
doubt
about...
let
me
ask
about
damages.
did
the
district
court
award
nominal
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
following
the
ninth
circuit
en
banc
opinion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
not
originally?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
ninth
circuit
used
as
the
basis
for
its
jurisdiction
once
yniguez
was
no
longer
employed
and
the
case
would
otherwise
be
moot
the
fact
that...
what?
although
the
district
court
had
not...
although
she...
had
she
asked
for
nominal
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
other
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
ninth
circuit
en
banc
sent
it
back
saying
that
you
could
have
awarded
nominal
damages,
even
though
the
court
had
not
awarded
nominal
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
since
it
hadn't
awarded
nominal
damages,
why
wasn't
the
case
moot
once
she
left
employment?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's...
so
retroactively
the
ninth
circuit
said
go
back
and
get
nominal
damages
and
that
will
retroactively
keep
the
case
alive.
is
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
case
was
over
below.
she
had
gotten
her
relief.
the
relief
did
not
include
nominal
damages.
the
only
relief
it
got
was
injunction
against
enforcing
this
against
her
in
the
future.
then
she
leaves
the
state
employ.
there's
nothing
left
to
the
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
just
a
declaratory
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
she
would
know
that
she
wouldn't
be
threatened,
or
chilled,
unrealistically
or
realistically,
whatever.
[laughter]
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
ninth
circuit
said,
however,
although
there's
nothing
here
that...
once
you've
left
employment
there's
really
nothing
at
issue
any
more,
there
could
be
something
at
issue
if
the
district
court
had
granted
you
nominal
damages,
and
we
will
remand
to
the
district
court
to
have
the
district
court,
if
it
wishes,
grant
you
nominal
damages,
whereupon,
retroactively,
our
jurisdiction
on
the
appeal
will
be
valid.
is
that
what
the
district
court
of
appeals
did?
you
can
object
to
the
question
as
leading.
[laughter]
chief
justice,
i'm
leading
him
where
he
doesn't
want
to
go.
i
think--
--he
wants
to
have
the
case
here,
but
i
don't
see
how
it's
here.
that's
characteristic
of
all
leading
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly
agree
with
that,
but
why
didn't
it
suddenly
become
nonexistent
as
soon
as
the
district
court
entered
a
judgment
that
didn't
include
nominal
damages
and
the
petitioner
later,
and
before
the
appeal,
resigned
from
her
state
employment?
why
didn't
it
become
moot
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
nonbinding
on
whom?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
was
the
plaintiff.
the
governor
was
the
defendant.
the
district
court
denied
her
nominal
damages
against
the
governor.
now,
to
be
sure,
the
governor
then
said,
i
don't
want
to
appeal,
but
why
couldn't
your
client
have
said,
but
i
do?
i
have
been
denied
nominal
damages.
i
think
i
was
entitled
to
them,
and
i
want
an
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
did
the
nominal
damages
cross-appeal
occur?
i'm
not
clear
on
that.
when
did
that
occur?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pohlman,
i
hate
to
come
back
to
this,
but
i'm
still
not
clear
on
it.
after
the
state
came
in
on
the
appeal,
when
did
the
cross-appeal
for
the
denial
of
nominal
damages
occur?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
after
remand,
though.
it's
after
remand.
the
original
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
went
up
and
back
down
without
any
claim
of
nominal
damages
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
