justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
part
of
your
answer
then
seems
to
me
that
you're
agreeing
that
you're
no
different
than
any
other
citizen
of
the
state
of
arizona.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
were
just
the
mechanism
for
putting
something
on
the
ballot.
unlike
a
legislature,
the
voters
didn't
give
any
authority
to
you.
they
voted
for
a
measure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
congress
is
a
standing
branch
of
the
government
with
ongoing
duties
and
responsibilities,
and
it
was
vitally
interested
in
the
one-house
veto
from
the
standpoint
of
its
institutional
capacity.
all
your
organization
did
was
put
something
on
the
ballot.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
attorney
general
said
it's
not
enforceable
in
the
circumstances
that
yniguez
said
it
was,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
controversy
before
the
court
if
you
have
no
standing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
had
thought
that
they
had
conflicting
positions.
i
had
thought
that
the
governor
indicated
that
she
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
it's
unconstitutional,
but
that
the
attorney
general
said
that
it
would
not
be
enforced
against
yniguez,
but
even
if
we
take
those
two
combined,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
controversy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no...
at
least
there's
no
threat.
there's
no
threat
to
the
employee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
at
that
point
where
was
the
controversy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
is
the
director
of
this
employee's
department
bound
by
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
of
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
binding
on
this
agency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
at
any
point
in
the
litigation
did
either
the
governor
or
the
attorney
general
indicate
that
your
client
would
be
disciplined
for
using
spanish?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
actually,
you
put
in
zero
zero
on
dollar
amounts,
did
you
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
she
did
ultimately
cross-appeal...
she
did
ultimately
cross-appeal
after
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
intervention
order,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
what
was
the
basis
for
her
cross-appeal.
what
was
she
asking
on
the
cross-appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
cross-appeal,
but
since
she
had
made
that
claim
only
on
cross-appeal,
if
aoe's
appeal
was
improper
because
it's
an
improper
party,
then
her
cross-appeal
fails
because
her
cross-appeal
was
only
derivative
of
the
main
appeal,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
exactly.
well,
but
where
the
question
is
based
on
the
chief
justice's
inquiry,
followed
by
justice
o'connor,
is
we're
assuming
the
state
officials
do
not
enforce
the
act,
and
justice
o'connor
points
out
that
the
initiative
does
have
a
citizens
suit
provision
allowing
a
citizen
to
enforce
the
act.
