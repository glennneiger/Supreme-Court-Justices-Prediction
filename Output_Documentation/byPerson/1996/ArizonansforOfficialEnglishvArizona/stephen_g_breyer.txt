justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
we
vacate
the
opinion
below?
that
is
to
say,
i
can
see
if
you
were
the
only
party
before
the
ninth
circuit
and
you
don't
have
standing,
then
we'd
vacate
that,
i
guess.
there
was
no
controversy
because
they
weren't
parties.
but
in
the
district
court,
prior
to
ms.
yniguez
leaving
her
job,
the
district
court
reached
its
decision
and
then
the
other
party
to
the
case,
the
governor,
decided
not
to
appeal,
so
there
was
no
appeal,
and
therefore
the
district
court
decision
stays
in
place.
i
suppose--
--so
why--
--yes.
i
suppose
there
is
a
question,
though,
which
i
had
already
asked
you,
about
whether
there
was
even--
--that's
right.
that's
right.
--a
controversy
at
the
district
court.
that--
--because
the
governor
took
the
same
position
as
ms.
yniguez.
exactly.
whether
there
was
ever
a
controversy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
could
you
go
back...
i
mean,
i'm
quite
interested
in
your
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
because
that
would
seem
to
be
determinative,
wouldn't
it,
about
whether
or
not
we
vacated,
assuming
you
lose
all
the
other
points,
the
district
court
decision
or
just
vacated
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
so
i
think
your
response
would
be
important
on
that.
and
of
course
if
you
left
that
in
place
you
could
review
the
matter
in
some
other
case.
i
mean,
you're
not
deprived
of
constitutional
review.
was
there
ever
a
point
when
the
governor
was
adverse
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
and
there
was
one
statement
that
the
governor
said
that
she
would
comply
with
the
constitutional
amendment,
and
she
expected
every
other
state
official
to
do
the
same.
now,
was
there
ever
any
adversary
contest
in
the
district
court,
or
did
we
have
a
friendly
lawsuit
throughout?
was
there
ever
any
point
where
the
governor
took
the
position
before
the
district
court,
i
am
defending
the
constitutionality
of
this
state
constitutional
provision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
pointed
to
a
place
in
the
district
court's
opinion
which
says
i,
the
district
judge,
think
there
was
a
reasonable
threat
of
prosecution.
where
in
the
record
do
i
find
the
material
upon
which
that
conclusion
rests?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
ms.
yniguez...
excuse
me.
where
do
i
find
what
the
governor
said,
because
what
he's
saying
is
it's
the
governor's
statement
that
leads
me
to
think
that
the
governor
might
prosecute
her.
