justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
a
mr.
park?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
is
it
that
they
have
standing
in
this
case
at
this
juncture?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
kind
of
rights
does
your
organization
have,
aoc,
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
assume
that
it's
some
kind
of
legislative
standing
for
them?
what
is
it
you're
arguing
for
that
would
give
them
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
diamond
v.
charles
would
require
us
to
say
that
the
organization
does
not
have
legislative
standing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
how
does
that
give
the
organization
here
standing,
arizonans
for
official
english?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
once
the
thing
is
adopted
by
the
voters,
i
don't
see
what
standing
that
organization
has
to
litigate
in
federal
court.
along
that
same
line,
how
is
your
organization
any
different
from
any
citizen
in
the
state
of
arizona?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
wouldn't
that
just
be
a
state
law
cause
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
how
do
you
get
to
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
governor
thought
the
constitutional
provision
was
invalid,
i
understand,
governor
mofford.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
was
there
a
case
or
controversy
in
the
district
court,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
government...
the
governor
agreed
that
the
proposition
was
invalid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
was
never...
there
was
never
an
answer
on
the
merits,
was
there?
there
was
just
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
arizona.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
isn't
that
all
there
was?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
yniguez
never
even
asked
for
nominal
damages
in
the
district
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
we
go
back
just
one
step?
we
have...
was
this
a
1983
action
in
the
district
courts--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--section
1983?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
have
we
not
held
in
cases
like
will
v.
michigan
that
states
and
state
officials
like
the
governor
are
not
persons
under
1983?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how
could
the
district
court
ever,
under
a
1983
suit,
assess
even
nominal
damages
against
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
we
find
that
express
waiver
in
the
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
your
brief
on
the
merits
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
citizens
suit
provision,
and
the
citizens
can
sue
in
state
court
to
enforce
something
that's
been
validly
passed
under
the
very
terms
of
the
provision
that
was
passed,
is
that
not
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
anybody
who
claims
to
be
adversely
affected.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
is
a
citizens
suit
provision.
somebody
can
come
into
court
and
raise
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
we
don't
worry
about
article
iii
in
state
court
actions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
guess
there
was
no
injunction
here.
a
declaratory
judgment,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
stipulation
you...
as
to
the
facts
covering
the
governor's
position,
i
thought
that
stipulation
said
nothing
about
the
governor
intending
to
take
enforcement
actions,
just
that
the
governor
intended
to
comply.
well,
if
the
governor
intends
to
comply
by
herself
speaking
english,
i
suppose
that
wouldn't
affect
this
at
all.
is
there
anything
in
the
stipulation
that
says
the
governor
intends
to
take
enforcement
actions
against
people
like
yniguez?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i
didn't
think
so.
