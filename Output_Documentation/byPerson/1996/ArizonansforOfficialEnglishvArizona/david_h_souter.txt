justice
david
h.
souter
what
basis
would
there
have
been
for
that?
i
mean,
the
attorney
general's
statement
of
state
law
was
not
a
statement
which
was
peculiar
to
her.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
district
court
was
wrong,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
at
that
point
the
case
was
certainly
moot,
even
if
we
make
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
case
or
controversy
at
some
point.
and
it
probably
became
moot
when
ms.
yniguez
left
her
state
employment,
i
would
have
thought,
at
the
very
least.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.--
--is
your
claim...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
i
had
one.
are
you
claiming
that
the
arizona
provision
therefore
creates
article
iii
standing
for
any
arizona
citizen
in
a
federal
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
is
the
invasion
of
the
right
which
would
be
in
any
way
different
from
an
invasion
which
any
citizen
simply
as
a
citizen
could
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in...
then
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
any
citizen
could
have
article...
would
have
article
iii
standing.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
there
was
no
legal
right
to
damages,
was
there?
i
mean,
the
ninth
circuit...
apart
from
everything
else
that
justice
scalia
recited,
the
ninth
circuit
was
also
wrong
in
suggesting
that
she
would
have
a
right
to
nominal
damages,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
court
wasn't...
but
the
claim
wasn't
that
the
court
was
going
to
prosecute
her.
the
claim
was
that
someone
representing
the
state,
the
governor,
the
attorney
general,
or
her
supervisor
was
going
to
bring
some
action
against
her,
and
the
opinion,
i
presume,
was
binding
on
those
people,
possibly
with
the
exception
of
the
governor,
but
it
was
binding
on
the
others,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
leaves
the
governor,
and
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
prior
to
the
district
court
judgment,
in
any
even
prior
certainly
to
the
expiration
of
the
appeal
period,
the
governor
herself
had
gone
on
record
in
her
own
right
as
saying
that
she
thought
it
was
proper
to
use
english
if
necessary
to
discharge
one's
duties
in
a
reasonable
way.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
didn't
she
at
some
point,
and
i'm
not
positive
of
what
this
moment
was,
didn't
she
also
indicate,
quite
apart
from
her
general
position
that
the
amendment
should
be
enforced,
that
she
believed
it
was
proper
for
a
state
employee
to
use
some
non-english
language
if
that
was
reasonable
in
the
discharge
of
the
employee's
duties?
didn't
she
say
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
pohlman,
may
i
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
going
to
the
issue
of
whether
we
should
vacate
the
district
court
judgment?
would
this
be
a
position
that
you
would
espouse,
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court
action,
neither
of
the
parties
before
the
district
court
appealed.
it
is
quite
true
that
there
was
then
an
intervention,
and
ultimately
in
the
ninth
circuit
the
state
came
in.
the
attorney
general
came
in
under
the
statute
for
the
purposes
of
defending
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
act.
but
the
attorney
general
at
that
point
was
in
there
only
on
a
kind
of
conditional
basis.
he
was
only
in
there
saying,
if
we're
going
to
have
an
appeal,
then
i'm
here
under
the
statute
representing,
in
effect,
the
state
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
if
i
can,
but
i'm
not
an
independent
appealing
party,
and
the
state
and
the
governor
are
not
independent
appealing
parties.
given
that
interpretation,
would
it,
even
on
our
normal
equitable
vacatur
rules,
be
appropriate
not
to
vacate
the
district
court
judgment,
because
the
parties
who
could
have
appealed
in
fact
did
not.
the
parties
who
presumably
would
suffer
from
leaving
the
judgment
on
the
books
did
not,
in
fact,
appeal.
would
that
be
a...
would
you
espouse
that
argument
for
opposing
vacating
the
district
court
order?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
was...
wasn't
that
after
the
appeal
period
had
run?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
so--
--that
was
the
position
that
you
took
in
this
footnote
that
i
read.
you
recognized
the
standing
of
the
attorney
general
as
a
proper
party.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then,
then
the
attorney
general
was
not
in
only
on
the
limited
basis
that
my
suggestion
gave
him,
so
i
suppose
if
you
accept
his
standing
as
a
party
at
that
point,
and
you
take
the
position
that
he
should
have
been
allowed
in,
period,
then
i
guess
the
argument
for
vacating
is
a
valid
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
mm-hmm.
justice
david
h.
souter
ah,
so
that's
why
they're
stuck.
yes,
okay.
could...
i
have
two
questions
briefly
that
i'd
like
to
hear
your
answer
to.
the
most
important
is,
i'd
like
to
hear
clearly
what
your
answer
was
to
justice
o'connor's
initial
question.
i
take
it
in
the
district
court
there
was
a
person,
the
plaintiff,
and
a
defendant,
the
governor,
who
had
an
argument.
the
plaintiff
won,
and
the
governor
didn't
appeal.
all
right,
but
the
question
was,
was
there
ever
a
controversy
between
them,
and
the
answer
to
that
depends
upon
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
threat
of
prosecution,
isn't
that
right?
that's
the
case
they
cited
in
support
of
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i've
known
some
state
judges
who
would
do
that.
[laughter]
how
many
district...
how
many
federal
district
judges
sit
in
arizona?
do
you
have
any
idea?
three
hundred?
