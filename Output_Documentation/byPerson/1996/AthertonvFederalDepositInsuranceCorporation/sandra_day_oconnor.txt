justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stevens,
i
think,
if
i
remember
correctly,
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
assumed
there
was
a
federal
common
law
standard
here,
and
left
it
open
on
remand
to
the
district
court
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
standard,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
petitioners
here
concede
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
federal
common
law
standard
applied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
the
question
whether
there
exists
a
federal
common
law
rule
was
preserved--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
wasn't...
it
wasn't
set
out
that
clearly
in
your
original
cert
petition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
state
law
do
you
say
applies
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
say
that
federal
law
governs--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--federally
chartered--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--savings
and
loans?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
wait
a
minute.
that's
a
separate
question.
you
could
say
yes,
federal
law
applies,
but
the
federal
law
in
turn
refers
to
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
order
to
answer
the
questions
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
savings
clause
in
this
federal
statute,
18--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--21(k)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
isn't
inoperative
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
that
at
least
faced
with
state
law
that
says
you
need
intentional
misconduct,
that
the
federal
law
says
no
gross
negligence
will
suffice,
so
of
course
it
isn't
inoperable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
have
one
last
question.
i'd
asked
you
before
if
you...
if
petitioners
had
conceded
below
that
federal
common
law
governed.
now,
judge
becker's
opinion
says
both
parties
conceded
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
was
that
an
error?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
agree
we
don't
have
to
decide
what
the
applicable
state
law
is
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
some
weren't,
and
to
say
in
the
statute
that
nothing
in
this
paragraph
shall
affect
any
right
of
the
fdic
under
other
applicable
law
reads
to
me
as
though
they
are
also
saving
state
law
where
it
applies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
quite
possibly
the
federal
common
law
directs
us
to
state
common
law
for
the
standard.
