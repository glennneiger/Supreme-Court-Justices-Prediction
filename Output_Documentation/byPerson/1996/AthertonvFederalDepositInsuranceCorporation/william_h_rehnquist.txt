we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-928,
john
w.
atherton,
jr.
v.
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
mr.
stevens.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
take
it
that
if
the
state
of
new
jersey
allowed
an
action
for
simple
negligence,
that
would
be
permissible
under
the
reserve
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
have
to
allow
at
least
gross
negligence,
but
if
they
have
a
more
proplaintiff
standard
of
liability
than
that,
that,
too,
is
incorporated.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stevens.
you've
reserved
the
time
remaining.
mr.
bress,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
by
no
means
the
only
reading
of
that
statute,
certainly.
i
mean,
to...
your
interpretation
is
certainly
not
the
only
one
that
comes
from
the
language.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--right.
ordinarily,
when
congress
legislates
in
a
particular
field,
it
is
substituting
a
statute
for
what
might
have
been
federal
common
law
before.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
city
of
milwaukee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
when
you
say
other
applicable
law,
do
you
think
that...
you
say
that
meant
they
meant
to
preserve
federal
common
law,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
no...
there
were
no
decisions
from
this
court
on
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
congress
is
supposed
to
sort
out
the
various
federal
rules
and
the
state
rules?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
preinsolvency,
or
postinsolvency?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
the
federal
chartering
authority
has
no
right
to
do
that,
but
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
the
federal
courts
should
step
in
on
their
own
and
develop
a
body
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
suggests
neither
uniformity,
nor
does
it
suggest,
as
i
thought
you
said
earlier,
that
1821(k)
adopts
some
sort
of
standard
of
ordinary
negligence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
sure
i
correctly
understood
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
has...
to
the
extent
it
has
a
standard,
its
standard
is
gross
negligence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
preinsolvency.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
your
argument's
just
extremely
opaque
on
that
point.
are
we
getting
into
a
position
where
we're
like
the
king
of
france?
we
march
up
the
hill
and
then
march
down
again?
if
federal
law
points
to
state
law,
then
what
difference
does
it
make?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
a
different
stage
of
the
proceeding,
preinsolvency.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
we
are
just...
if
you're
saying
1821(k)
addresses
this,
we're
talking
about
gross
negligence,
not
simple
negligence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
bress.
mr.
stevens,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stevens.
the
case
is
submitted.
