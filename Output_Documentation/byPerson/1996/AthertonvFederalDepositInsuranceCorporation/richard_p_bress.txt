mr.
richard
p.
bress
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1821(k)
is
a
plainly
worded
provision,
and
in
our
view
it
means
precisely
what
it
says.
it
provides
that
the
fdic
as
receiver
may
hold
officers
and
directors
of
failed
financial
institutions
liable
for
their
gross
negligence
or
worse
misconduct
while
preserving
the
fdic's
preexisting
right
to
assert
against
those
officers
and
directors
whatever
claims
the
institution
could
have
asserted
on
its
own
behalf.
now,
petitioner's
argument
to
the
contrary
is
based
on
a
supposed
negative
implication.
at
least--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
that
is
certainly
their
primary
argument.
their
secondary
argument,
however,
is
that
even
if
there
was
federal
common
law
it's
been
supplanted
by
the
statute.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
the
arguments
have
sort
of
switched
place
in
terms
of
what's
primary
and
what's
not
from
the
briefing
schedule.
if
you'd
like,
your
honor,
i
can
address
the
underlying
law
at
this
point.
i'd
just
like
to
note
before
i
do
it
that
either
federal
common
law
exists,
in
which
case
the
statute
preserves
the
fdic's
right
to
assert
it,
or
federal
law,
common
law
doesn't
exist,
in
which
case
we're
all
agreed
that
state
law
governs
and
that
the
fdic
can
assert
the
institution's
state
law
claims.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
all
right,
and
i'd
like
to
note
one
extra
thing
at
this
point
which
is,
to
the
degree
that
there's
an
argument
here
that
the
fdic
has
waived
its
state
law
claims,
there
has
been
no
waiver
here.
in
fact,
the
third
amended
complaint
that's
been
filed
simply
alleges
counts
for
negligence,
gross
negligence,
and
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
oh,
i
agree,
your
honor,
primarily
because
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
applicable
state
law
here.
i'd
like
to
address
that,
if
i
may.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
that
can
be
explained
by
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
at
the
time
that
congress
acted,
and
what
congress'
purposes
here
were.
this
was
emergency
legislation,
and
congress
had
a
very
simple
purpose,
which
was
to
preempt
state
insulating
statutes
that
could
insulate
officers
and
directors
of
financial
institutions
from
liability
to
the
fdic.
now,
at
that
time,
while
the
majority
of
courts
were
applying
the
uniform
ordinary
care
standard
of
federal
common
law
to
officers
and
directors
of
federally
chartered
associations,
some
courts
were
applying
state
law
to
officers
and
directors
of
federally
chartered
associations.
congress
didn't
try
to
sort
out
which
was
the
right
answer.
congress
just
wanted
to
make
sure,
whatever
a
court
might
otherwise
apply,
the
fdic
would
always
have
a
suit
for
gross
negligence,
so
if
a
court
would
apply
the
state's
law
to
a
federally
chartered
association,
congress
was
telling
them,
well,
apply
that
state's
gross
negligence
standard.
however,
if
a
court
were
to
apply
federal
common
law
the
question
really
would
never
come
up,
because
under
federal
common
law
the
standard
is,
and
has
for
a
long
time,
been
a
standard
of
ordinary
care.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
your
honor,
but
we
believe
it's
the
one
that
makes
the
most
sense
out
of
the
language
in
the
following
sense.
the
savings
clause
preserves
the
fdic's
rights
under
other
applicable
law.
now,
at
the
time,
congress
is
presumed
to
enact
laws
with
knowledge
of
what
the
surrounding
law
is,
and
at
that
time
the
vast
majority
of
courts
were
applying
federal
common
law
to
suits
against
officers
and
directors
of
federally
chartered
associations,
so
to
take
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
you
have
to
believe
that
congress
missed
that
entirely
and
believed
that
state
law
was
applicable.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
oh,
no,
no,
no.
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
with
regard
to
federally
chartered
associations
the
reference
to
other
applicable
law--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--in
terms
of
civil
suits
would
be
federal
common
law.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
when
the
statute
speaks
to
the
matter
at
issue
this
court
has
said
that
that's
what...
but
in
order
to
determine
what
the
statute
says
when
it
speaks
we've
got
to
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
what
this
statute
says
is,
the
fdic
can
always
sue
for
gross
negligence,
but
the
fdic
can
also
assert
whatever
it
could
have
asserted
otherwise
under
other
applicable
law.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
would
have
been
odd
had
they
not,
because
as
i've
said,
with
regard
to
federal
associations
that
was
the
primary
law
that
was
applicable.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
but
there
were
decisions
from
courts
of
appeals
in
district
courts,
and
congress
is
presumed
to
know
those.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
we're
not
contending
that
congress
sorted
out
and
decided
what
was
correct
and
what
was
incorrect.
all
we're
saying
is
that
congress
would
have
been
aware
that
the
vast
majority
of
courts
were
applying
federal
common
law.
congress
didn't
try
to
sort
it
out.
congress
just
said
whatever
the
courts
are
applying,
you've
got
a
gross
negligence
standard.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
oh,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
all
right.
i'd
like
to
address
that,
your
honor.
let
me
just
preface
it
with
a
notion,
though,
that
the
statute
doesn't
purport
to
affect
what
the
rights
of
the
institution
would
have
against
its
own
officers
and
directors,
so
if
you
adopt
the
position
that
federal
common
law
is
supplanted
with
respect
to
fdic
suits,
you
do
have
a
situation
where
the
institution
before
it
fails
could
sue
under
federal
common
law
for
ordinary
care,
but
if
the
officer-directors
perform
so
poorly
the
institution
goes
under,
the
fdic
is
limited
to
the
gross
negligence
standard.
that's
a
bit
odd.
but
now
let
me
address
what
the
underlying
law
is.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
let
me
now
address
that.
this
court
has
long
understood
that
a
corporation
is
a
creature
of
law,
and
that
its
internal
affairs
are
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
chartering
authority,
that
the
chartering
authority
and
no
other
sovereign
is
the
sovereign
that
has
the
predominant
interest
in
those
internal
affairs.
now,
that's
not
just
as
a
conflict
of
laws
principle.
the
court
has
applied
that
in
the
context
where
you've
got
federal
preemption
in
dormant
commerce
clause
challenges.
it's
a
principle
of
sovereignty
at
its
fundamental
base.
now--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
it
flows
from
principles
of
sovereignty.
it
does
not
make
it
unconstitutional,
but
it
certainly
does
flow
from
principles
of
sovereignty.
this
court
has
stated
that
in
burks,
in
kamen,
in
cohens.
with
regard
to
state
institutions
the
court
has
said,
because
it's
created
by
the
state,
all
of
the
rights
and
responsibilities
flow
from
that
state's
laws,
and
it
has
also
made
clear
the
flip
side,
that
when
an
institution...
the
court
has
made
clear
that
when
an
institution
is
chartered
by
the
federal
government
it's
from
the
federal
government
and
from
that
charter
that
the
rights
and
responsibilities
flow.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
what's
that?
mr.
richard
p.
bress
and
in
contracts
as
well.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
not
at
all,
your
honor,
in
this
sense.
i
mean,
erie,
the
primary
purpose
of
erie
and
the
primary
insight
of
erie
is
that
law
has
to
flow
from
an
identifiable
sovereign.
there's
no
transcendental
common
law
floating
out
there.
but
after
erie,
it
was
not
the
case
that
all
common
law
was
state.
most
common
law
was,
but
in
areas
of
unique
or
essential
federal
interest
the
law
is
federal.
now,
with
regard
to
contracts,
we're
not
saying
that
a
bank's
contracts
with
third
parties
are
governed
by
federal
law.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
it's
certainly
true
that
in
many
areas
this
court
as
a
pointer
rule
will
look
to
a
state's
law
really
as
a
convenient
point
of
reference,
and
we
think
that
that's
a
propriate
in
many
instances.
it
is
not
appropriate,
however,
where
analogous
federal
law
provides
you
with
some
idea
of
what
congress
thought
about
the
matter,
and
in
this
case,
by
providing
under
section
1818(i)
and
section
1818(e)
that
the
federal
regulators
can
enforce
breaches
of
fiduciary
duties
which
at
the
time
the
statute
was
created
clearly
included
the
duty
of
ordinary
care,
congress
is
telling
us
that
for
federal
purposes
enforcement
of
the
duty
of
ordinary
care
is
an
important
interest.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
your
honor,
if
we
were
talking
about
inventing
all
of
corporate
law
for
financial
institutions
i
would
be
constrained
to
agree
with
you.
we're
not
talking
about
that.
all
we're
talking
about
is
an
area
where
congress
has
itself
said
that
the
duty
of
ordinary
care
will
be
enforced.
now,
matters
as
demand
on
the
corporation,
futility
of
demand,
that
sort
of
thing,
sure,
a
pointer
rule
would
be
appropriate,
but
where
congress
has
said
the
duty
of
ordinary
care
should
be
enforced,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
enforce
that
duty
of
ordinary
care
rather
than,
for
instance...
let
me
give
you
an
example.
if
a
state
were
to
completely
remove
all
duty
of
care
from
its
officers
and
directors,
should
that
then
mean
that
the
federal
institution
would
have
no
claim
whatever
and
no
ability
to
enforce
fiduciary
duties
of
its
own
officers-directors,
and
similarly--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--i'm
talking
about
preinsolvency,
and
similarly,
if
a
state
were
to
enact
strict
liability
as
the
standard,
should
that
mean
that
the
federal
chartering
authority
should
have
no
ability
to
make
sure
that
their
institutions
could
attract
officers
and
directors--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
your
honor,
i'm
glad
you've
mentioned
that.
the
ots,
office
of
thrift
supervision,
enforces
section
1818(i)
and
section
1818(e),
and
in
the
context
of
agency
adjudication
has
interpreted
those
sections
to
refer,
when
they
refer
to
breach
of
fiduciary
duties,
to
the
duty
of
ordinary
care,
and
further
than
that,
and
in
terms
of
looking
for
certainty
in
the
law,
the
ots
has
set
out
the
sorts
of
duties
that
are
expected
of
an
ordinarily
prudent
director
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
those
duties
are--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--the
ots
has
spoken
in
agency
adjudication
and
said
that
the
duties
that
are
enforced
should
be
the
duties
that
the
federal
regulator
enforces
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
should
not
depend
on
the
courts
of
state
law.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
it
said
that
in
agency
adjudication.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
okay.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
address
that
in
two
parts,
if
i
may.
first
of
all,
the
conflict
and
the
degree
of
conflict
that
is
necessary
really
depends
on
what
you're
doing
with
regard
to
state
law.
in
o'melveny
and
many
other
of
these
courts'
cases
what
you're
dealing
with
is...
and
in
boyle
as
well...
you're
displacing
state
law
that
would,
in
fact,
otherwise
apply
in
an
area
where
the
state
has
an
interest.
here
what
you're
talking
about
is--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
let
me...
i
will
address
that,
your
honor.
what--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--i--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
most
states
as
a
matter
of
common
law
and
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
they
don't
speak
in
terms
of
ordinary
negligence.
what
they
speak
of
in
terms
of
is
ordinary
care
is
the
standard,
and
they
apply
that
with
the
business
judgment
rule,
so
that
you've
got
to
demonstrate
ordinary
care
to
even
get
within
the
business
judgment
rule,
and
if
you've
exercised
ordinary
care...
and
we
agree
with
this.
if
you've
exercised
ordinary
care
you
will
not
be
held
liable
for
honest
mistakes
of
judgment.
there's
no--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--okay--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
there
are
several
states,
and
there
was
a
trend
during
the
late
1980's
of
states
that
were,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
restricting
liability
of
officers
and
directors
to
gross
negligence
or
worse.
many...
several
of
them
were
restricting
it
to
intentional
or
wanton
misconduct.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
in
terms
of
negligence
and
ordinary
negligence
this...
it's
somewhat
helpful,
i
think,
even
now
to
look
back
at
the...
at
this
court's
formulation
in
briggs
where
it
said
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
ordinary
care
is
the
standard,
and
in
some
circumstances
perhaps
slight
care
is
required.
for
example,
it
isn't
a
transaction
that
really
has
much
impact
on
the
bank.
in
some
instances,
however,
you've
got
a
bet...
your
company
transaction
and
great
care
is
required,
and
you
look
to
whether
the
director
has
satisfied
the
care
required
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
but
if
i
might
continue
as
to
why
we
use
a
federal
standard--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--they
are,
your
honor,
and
in
those
instances
you
do
have--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
in
those
instances
you
have
two
separate
standards
that
are
going
to
apply
to
the
officers
and
directors,
because
you
have
two
separate
sovereigns
that
have
an
interest.
however,
as
petitioner
has
effectively
conceded
here,
i
think,
while
we
can
point
as
a
pointer
rule
to
the
state
where
the
main
office
is,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
that
state
has
a
substantial
interest
in
the
internal
workings
of
a
federally
chartered
institution.
we're
just
pointing
to
it
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
your
honor,
and
in
that
circumstance--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
think
congress
did,
because
there's
no
question
that
ordinary
care
is
the
standard
for
purposes
of
federal
regulatory
enforcement
as
a
federal
standard,
because
the
statute
was
enacted
to
protect
the
federal
interest
in
the
safety
and
soundness
of
all
banks.
however,
congress
recognizes
that
states
are
the
ones
that
dictate
the
civil
standards
of
liability
for
their
own
institutions,
the
rights
of
the
institution
and
the
shareholders
vis-a-vis
the
directors.
you
have
two
different
standards
for
states
because
you've
got
two
different
sovereigns.
here,
you've
one
sovereign
with
an
interest
in
it,
and
under
hola,
as
this
court
recognized
in
de
la
questa,
the
homeowners
loan
act,
congress
evinced
a
desire
to
have
uniformity
in
the
regulation
of
savings
and
loans.
this
isn't
just
the
courts
invoking
the
interest
of
uniformity,
this
is
congress
saying
that
uniformity
is
important.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
if
i...
if
that's
how
i
came
across,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
i
would...
and
that's
further
that
i
wanted
to
go.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
statute
itself
includes
a
duty
of
ordinary
care
in
it.
the
ots,
in
enforcing
that
duty
of
ordinary
care,
will,
as
the
expert
body,
flesh
it
out
somewhat,
give
an
idea
of
what
that
entails
for
officers
and
directors
of
federally
chartered
institutions,
and
that's
going
to
give
you
a
better
idea...
i
mean,
perhaps
delaware
does
have
a--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
not
quite,
your
honor.
what
we're
really
saying
is
this
is--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--all
right...
well,
fairly
close,
your
honor.
what
we're
coming
at
is
really
in
kamen
what
this
court
said
is
if
there
is
an
analogous
federal
provision
that
gives
you
an
idea
of
what
congress
would
have
done
in
this
area,
you
look
to
that.
this
court
did
that
in
musick
and
peeler,
the
same
sort
of
a
thing,
where
under
10(b)(5)
the
court
said
that
you
would
use
the
contribution
from
the
'34
act.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
statute's
telling
you,
and
i
think
that
what's
actually
the
case
here,
is
that
there
is
a
federal
interest,
for
instance,
with
regard
to
all
banks
whether
they're
state
or
federal,
that's
clear,
and
in
1821(k)
that
interest
was
the
federal
interest
as
in
shaw,
and
what
congress
did
is
said...
the
first
draft,
in
fact,
of
the
senate
bill
would
have
allowed
the
fdic
to
proceed
as
receiver
under
any
common
law
action,
including
ordinary
negligence.
there
were
objections
to
that
that
were
federalism-based.
the
federalism-based
objection
said,
look,
what
you're
talking
about
are,
you're
including
corporations
that
we've
chartered,
and
as
to
which
we
dictate
the
internal
affairs,
and
some
states
might
legitimately
believe
that
gross
negligence
rather
than
ordinary
negligence
is
the
right
standard.
so
congress
compromised.
they
said
the
fdic
will
always
be
able
to
sue
for
gross
negligence
even
though,
if
a
state
has
chosen
a
lower
threshold
or
a
higher
threshold--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--no,
your
honor,
i...
i'm
sorry
if
that
point
has
become
confused.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
we
don't
say
that
1821(k)
as
a
standard
of
ordinary
negligence.
what
we're
pointing
to
for
that
is--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
that's
not
where
our
argument's
going.
1818(i)
and
1818(e)
are
provisions
where
the
federal
regulator
can
enforce
breaches
of
fiduciary
duties.
at
the
time
those
provisions
were
enacted,
it
was
very
clear--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--that
breach
of
fiduciary
duties
included...
preinsolvency
that
breach
of
fiduciary
duties
included
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
ordinary
care.
all
we're
saying
here
is,
you've
got
a
circumstance
where
you're
either
going
to
use
a
state
law
pointer
rule,
or
you're
going
to
adopt
a
uniform
federal
standard.
because
congress
has
said
that
the
uniform
federal
standard
should
be
enforced
as
ordinary
care,
it's
more
appropriate
to
use
that
federal
standard
that
congress
has
already
told
us
is
the
standard
that
should
apply--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--we're
not
saying
that
federal
law
points
to
state
law,
your
honor.
what
we're
saying
is
that
federal
law
is
the
law
that's
applicable.
it's
been
suggested
that
we
could
point
to
state
law.
we're
disagreeing
with
that.
we're
saying,
no,
there's
a
federal
standard
that
congress
has
already
said
these
officers
and
directors
should
live
up
to.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
but
again,
all
the
fdic's
taking
here
are
the
rights
that
the
institution
had
preinsolvency.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
1821(k)
says
that
if
the
other
applicable
law
doesn't
give
you
a
gross
negligence
standard,
you
can
still
sue
for
gross
negligence.
what
we're
saying
is
that
with
regard
to
federally
chartered
institutions
their
rights
vis-a-vis
their
own
directors
and
officers
are
governed
by
federal
law
because
they
operate
under
a
federal
charter,
and
in
determining
what
those
rights
are
and
what
the
duties
are,
we
can
either
look
for
the
state
pointer...
and
by
the
way,
the
pointer
is
not
always
going
to
look
to
states
with
a
well
developed
corporate
law.
according
to
petitioner,
the
pointer
might
point
to
any
state
where
you've
got
the
main
office,
but
you
can
either
use
a
state
pointer,
or
you
could
look
to
what
the--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--federal
government
has
said
ought
to
be
enforced
as
the
duty,
and
we're
just
saying,
given
the
interest
in
uniformity
demonstrated
in
the
homeowners
loan
act
that
savings
and
loans
should
be
subject
to
uniform
standards,
one
should
look
to
what
congress
has
said
and
apply
a
uniform
standard,
otherwise--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--in
section
1818(i)(b)(2)
congress
has
said
that
officers
and
directors
can
be
subject
to
civil
money
penalties
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duties
that
cause
or
are
likely
to
cause
more
than
minimum
damage
to
the
institution.
now,
i
grant
that
that
section
doesn't
say
what
breach
of
fiduciary
duties
means,
but
this
court
has
long
looked,
and
the
latest
case
is
desaterfield
v.
mans
and
ccnv
v.
reid...
has
long
said
that
when
the
congress
uses
a
common
law
term,
we
look
to
what
that
term...
whether
that
term
had
an
established
meaning.
the
term
did
have
an
established
meaning,
and
that
included
the
duty
of
ordinary
care,
and
if
you
rule
against
us,
your
honor,
what
will
occur
is
that
officers
and
directors
of
federal
institutions
will
have
different
and
varying
duties
of
care.
it
will
have
a
duty
of
care
for
the
federal
regulators
and
a
different
one--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--officers
and
directors
of
federally
chartered
associations--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--that's
all
i'm
talking
about,
is
officers
and
directors
of
federals.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
right.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
we
think
that
judge
easterbrook
correctly
recognized
that--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--throughout
the
chartering
authority--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--but
he
was
incorrect
in
believing
that
it
was
displaced
when
you've
got
an
express
savings
clause.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
it
really
has
no
practical
application.
i
mean,
when
congress
passed
the
statute,
though,
it
wasn't
acting
imprudently,
because
at
that
time
some
courts
were
applying
state
law
to
federal
institutions,
so
congress--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--whenever
the
law
is
out
there,
we're
leaving
it
alone.
if
they
were
going
to
apply
state
law
to
you,
and
that
state
law
would
not
give
you
a
cause
of
action
for
gross
negligence,
you've
got
it.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
there
would
be
no...
there
would...
no--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--by
virtue
of
this
court's
decision,
if
the
court
were
to
rule
that
way,
there
would
be
no
need
to
resort
to
the
first
sentence.
however,
i
am
at
pains
to
emphasize
that
at
the
time
congress
passed
the
statute,
that
sentence
would
have
had
meaning
even
with
regard
to
federal
associations
because
some
courts
were
applying
state
law,
and
if
congress
hadn't
included
federal
associations
within
the
first
sentence,
then
as
to
those
courts
that
were
applying
state
law
to
federal
charters,
you
wouldn't
have
a
standard
of...
a
cause
of
action
of
gross
negligence
available.
so
a
subsequent
event,
this
court's
decision
unifying
the
law
and
saying
that
there
is
a
federal
common
law
standard,
and
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
to
go
on
and
say
what
it
is,
but
if
it
does,
it's
ordinary
care--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--a
subsequent
decision
of
that
sort
would
render
the
first
sentence
of
no
practical
effect
with
regard
to
federal
charters,
that's
true.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
all
right,
your
honor,
let
me
address
that.
we're
not
saying
that
congress
acted
in
recognition
of
the
standard
under
1818(i)
or
1818(e)
at
the
point
when
it
enacted
1821(k).
what
we're
saying
is
that
when
it
enacted
1821(k),
justice
breyer,
the
courts,
the
majority,
vast
majority
of
courts
at
that
time
were
already
applying
a
uniform
ordinary
care
standard.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
this
court
had
not,
but
congress
doesn't...
it
doesn't
just
enact
laws
in
recognition
of
what
this
court's
decisions
are.
congress
is
presumed
to
know
at
least
where
there
is
a
majority--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--no--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
there's
no
contradiction
whatever.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
what
we're
saying
is
that
congress
had
no
view
as
to
what
the
correct
answer
was.
the
vast
majority
of
courts
were
applying
federal
law,
but
some
courts
clearly
were
applying
state
law
as
well.
congress
had
no
reason,
no
desire
to
sort
that
out.
this
was
emergency
legislation.
congress
said,
whatever
the
courts
are
applying,
they...
you
can
continue
to
have
that,
but
you're
going
to
have
gross
negligence
as
a
minimum,
as
a
floor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
if
that's
gotten
lost,
i'm
sorry.
the
uniformity
comes
from
hola
itself,
the
homeowners
loan
act.
as
this
court
interpreted
the
homeowners
loan
act--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--what's
that?
mr.
richard
p.
bress
right.
no,
what
i'm
saying
is,
as
this
court
has
interpreted
the
homeowners
loan
act
in
de
la
questa,
congress
intended
at
the
time
that
statute
was
enacted
to
have
uniform
regulation
of
savings
and
loans.
now,
at
the
time
firrea
was
enacted
congress
wasn't
interested
in
changing
the
workings
of
the
internal
affairs
of
banks
themselves.
all
it
was
saying
was,
when
the
fdic
comes
in
as
receiver,
in
order
to
protect
the
insurance
fund
the
fdic
is
always
going
to
be
able
to
sue
for
gross
negligence.
now,
it's
still
going
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
institution,
but--
