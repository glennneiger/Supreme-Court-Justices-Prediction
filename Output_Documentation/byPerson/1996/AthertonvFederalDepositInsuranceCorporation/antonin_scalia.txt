the
only
thing
to
be
said
on
the
other
side,
however,
is
what...
it's...
other
corporations
that
are
established
under
delaware
law,
new
jersey
law,
or
whatever,
they
have
a
clear
law
to
apply
when
there
is
a
suit
by
shareholders
as
far
as
internal
management
is
concerned.
you
know
what
the
law
is.
is
it
likely
that
congress
set
up
this
federal
corporation
without
any
internal
procedures
governed
by
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
was
that
adopted?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
before
erie,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
what
congress
was
thinking
at
the
time
was
that
there
is
up
in
the
sky
there
a
common
law
concerning
directors'
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
didn't.
it
didn't.
there
was
no
such
thing
as
state
common
law
and
federal
common
law
before
erie.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
made
that
up
after
erie.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
saying
is,
we...
in
light
of
what
happened
after
erie
we
should
treat
corporate
law
the
same
way
we
treat
contract
law.
although
we
thought
there
was
a
federal
law,
having
discovered
there
is
not,
it
goes
back
to
being
governed
by
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be,
but
i
think
you
still
have
to
overcome
justice
ginsburg's
assertion
that
if
there
is
no
federal
substantive
law
there
is
also
no
federal
choice
of
law,
so
you
really
can't
say
for
sure
that
the
law
which
governs
is
the
law
of
principal
place
of
business.
it
depends
on
what
the
state
law
of
the
forum
is,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
really
don't
know
what
law
governs.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
most
forums
it
would
probably
be
the
state
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
a
way
it
is,
because
we
hate
to
have
these
corporations
floating
out
there
with
no
accepted
law
governing
their
internal
operations.
and
you've
already
said
that
under
state
law
it
would
not
be
the
principal
place
of
business,
it
would
be
the
place
of
incorporation
that
determines
the
internal
operations.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you--
--mr.
stevens,
maybe
we
have
here
what
is...
what
conflict-of-laws
mavens
call
"renvoi".
that
is
to
say
that
the
state
law
would
look
to
the
place
of...
to
the
state
of
incorporation,
the
state
of
incorporation
here
being
the
federal
government,
the
federal
government
having
no
rule
on
the
question
refers
it
back
to
state
law,
and
maybe
that's
how
you
get
where
you
want
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
all
this
be
solved
by
regulation?
i
mean,
suppose
the
federal
government
is
very
upset
that
there
is
no
clear...
clear
rule
as
to
which
law
governs
the
internal
affairs
on
this
particular
issue,
could
a
regulation
be
issued
which
would
set
forth--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mm-hmm.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
only
after
takeover,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
haven't
argued
to
the
contrary.
they
would
agree
with
everything
you've
said
so
far.
the
only
issue
is,
they
don't
think
there
are
any
rights
that
it
had
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
what
you're
going
to
address
now,
or
the
primary?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
generally
agreed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
there's
no
reference
to
state
law,
that
that
provision
does
not
refer
to
state
law
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
sovereignty?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
state,
for
example,
to
impose
upon
directors
for
certain
activities
a
liability
higher...
to
that
state's
citizens
a
liability
higher
than
what
the
corporate
state
of
incorporation
would
provide?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
contracts--
--well,
that
may
be,
but
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
contracts,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
mean,
i
said
that
somewhat
facetiously,
because
i
just
wondered
under
the
principles
of
erie
what
good
reason
there
is
to
have
a
special
federal
law
that's
substantive
in
relation
to
banks
that
are
chartered
federally
that
wouldn't
also
apply
to
contracts,
torts,
and
a
whole
bunch
of
things,
and
indeed,
what
is
the
implication
of
that
for
erie?
are
we
recreating
federal
common
law
in
a
new
area
across
the
board?
that's,
i
guess,
the
question
you've
been
asked
by
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
argument
goes
well
beyond
that.
it
goes
to
the
entire
internal
management
of
the
corporation
if
the
theory
you're
putting
before
us
is
correct,
and
i
would
go
further
than
justice
breyer.
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
lot
more
chance
of
some
certainty
in
the
law
if
we
refer
to
state
law
than
if
we
try
to
apply
some
nebulous
federal
common
law
of
internal
operations
of
the
corporation.
it
will
take
us,
you
know,
100
years
to
develop
a
federal
law
of
internal
management
of
corporations.
we've
never
done
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bress--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
congress
has
said
where,
in
(i)?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
just
told
us
the
opposite.
you
just
told
us
that
the
reason
the...
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg
that
the
reason
the
first
sentence
makes
sense
even
as
applied
to
federal
institutions
is
that
congress
didn't
know
what
the
law
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
be
applying
state
law,
they
might
be
applying
federal
law.
that's
what
you
told
justice
ginsburg.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
in
response
to
this
question
you
say
congress
must
have
assumed
that
they...
you
know,
since
the
vast
majority
of
lower
courts
were
applying
federal
law,
that
this
was
a
federal
law
at
issue.
