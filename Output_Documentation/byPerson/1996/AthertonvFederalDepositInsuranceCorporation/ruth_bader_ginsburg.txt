justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
in
response
to
the
district
court's
ruling,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
district
court's
opinion
said
that
1821(k)
was
the
exclusive
law
applicable
to
a
federal,
federally
chartered
institution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
are
not
defending
that
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
no
one
is
supporting
the
district
court,
who
said
that
1821(k)
is
just
it,
there's
nothing
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
so
to
that
extent
you
agree
that
the
district
court
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
stevens,
one
problem
is
that
there
is
no
entity,
no
state
that
has
chartered
the
federal
institution,
so
let's
assume
for
the
minute
that
we
don't
have
any
1821(k),
and
the
question
is
simply,
what
law
governs
the
internal
operations
of
a
federally
chartered
institution?
how
do
you
answer
that?
it
wouldn't
be
the
law
of
incorporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
cited
that
in
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
to
get
to
the
principal
place
of
business
by
some
federal
law,
and
you
at
least
have
a
federal
choice
of
law
rule,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
where
did
the
identification
of
the
principal
place
of
business
come
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
the
sky.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
under
state
law
the
state
of
incorporation
would
govern
internal
operations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
identified
the
principal
place
of
business
as
the
state
law
that
would
control.
i
asked
you
how
you
get
there,
how
you
get
that
pointing
rule.
you
have
to
get
it
from
some
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
the
rule--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no,
but--
--i
thought
the
rule
in
most
states
is
the
state
of
incorporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
but
you're--
--so
then
you're
not...
then
you're
not
getting
the
pointing
rule
from
state
law,
because
state
law
would
say,
we
look
to
the
state
of
incorporation
to
determine
matters
of
internal
operations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stevens,
i
thought
your
position
was
that
there
was
in
effect
nothing
to
save,
because
there
never
was
any
governing
federal
common
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
quite
different
from...
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
seemed
to
imply
there
was
federal
common
law
but
there
is
no
longer
by
virtue
of
the
first
sentence
of
1821(k).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stevens,
i
don't
follow
how
you
suddenly
saw
a
light
from
o'melveny
which
involved
a
state
chartered
institution,
so
this
question
of
what
law
governs
the
internal
operations
of
a
federally
chartered
institution
wasn't
touched
by
o'melveny.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
govern
a
state-chartered
institution
that
has
internal
operations
controlled
by
the
state
of
incorporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
bress,
that
depends
on
assuming
that
there
is
federal
common
law
that
would
govern
the
internal
operation,
something
that
this
court
has
never
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bress,
i
think
you
ought
to
clarify
one
thing.
it
isn't
the
state
law
generally
that
ordinary
negligence
is
the
standard,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought...
if
that
were
the
case
there
would
never
have
been
any
need
for
this
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
--maybe
i'm
confused.
i
thought
that
the
whole
reason
for
1812
had
nothing
to
do
with
federally
chartered
institutions.
it
had
to
do
with
states
that
were
insulating
officers
and
directors
from
any
liability--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
congress
wanted
to
say
at
least
gross
negligence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
in--
--mr.
bress,
what
are
the
problems
about
the
uniformity?
you
are
saying
federal
common
law,
and
we
look
to
an
administrative
agency,
ots,
to
get
that
federal
common
law,
and
that...
that's
rather
odd.
there
is
no
delaware
corporation
statute
for
the
federal,
so
we
have
to
get
the
law
from
some
place,
and
you
say,
well,
the
federal
common
law
should
be
what
the
ots
has
pronounced.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
are
taking
the
position,
mr.
bress,
that
the
first
sentence
has
no
application
to
a
federally
chartered
institution
because
you
will
have
under
the
federal
common
law
this
ordinary
negligence
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
saying
that
congress
said
we
don't
know
what
it
is,
but
whatever
it
is,
we're
not
leaving...
we're
leaving
it
alone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
saying,
if
your
reading
is
correct
that
there
is
an
ordinary
negligence,
federal
common
law
standard,
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
ever
to
resort
to
the
gross
negligence
part--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
any
federally
chartered
institution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
what
section
are
you
referring
to?
