justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
--it's
also--
--i
don't
think
the
briefs
tell
us
what
the
rule
is
in
new
jersey.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
really
doesn't
matter,
then,
if
there's
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
it
might
not
be.
they've
waived
that
legal
basis
for
the
claim,
but
i
would
think
there's
a
question
whether
the
basically
alleging
the
same,
you
know,
misconduct
by
the
defendants
in
the
case.
whether
it's
too
late
for
them
to
say
an
alternative
legal
base
for
the
claim
would
be
state
law
even
though
we
haven't
argued
it
up
to
now,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
to
that
is
is
all
i'm
saying.
that's
why
i
was
curious
about
whether
there
is
a
difference,
but
the
answer
to
that
is,
you
would
disagree
with
your
opponents,
probably.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
applying
the
gross
negligence
standard
in
accordance
with
state
law
and
so
forth?
would
you
look
to
the
state
of
incorporation
or
the
place
of
business
of
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
your
view
of
the
case,
that's
what
has
to
be
done
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
gross
negligence
standard
specified
in
1821(k)
in
conformity
with
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
state
law
are
we
talking
about
in
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--everybody
agrees
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
because
that's
the
principal
place
of
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
i
think
this
is
what
you're
going
to
address,
but
you
contend
there
is
a
federal
common
law
that
is
applicable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
the
federal
common
law
rule
one
that
is
the
same
in
all
states
in
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why,
then,
is
the
federal
statutory
gross
negligence
law...
rule
somewhat
different
in
different
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
with
one
question?
your
argument
based
on
1818(i)
and
(e)
and
the
regulatory
power,
are
those
regulatory
powers
of
the
ots
applicable
to
state-chartered
institutions
as
well
as
federal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
if
you're
right
that
those
sections
dictate
ordinary
care
across
the
board,
congress
didn't
have
to
enact
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
do
under
the
gross
negligence
standard
anyway.
you've
agreed
they
do
under
the
gross
negligence
standard,
because
that
refers
to
state
law
in
any
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
oh,
you're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--am
i
correct
that...
you're
familiar
with
the
seventh
circuit
case
where
judge
easterbrook
took
part
of
your
position
and
judge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--posner
took
another
part.
you
wouldn't
agree
with
either
one
of
those
opinions,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
went
the
first
step.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
they're
entitled
to
change
their
position.
you've
changed
your
position
too,
but--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
basically
you
do...
you
agree
with
judge
posner's
analysis,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
he
rejected
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that--
