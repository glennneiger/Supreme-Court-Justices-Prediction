mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
fdic,
in
its
capacity
as
receiver
of
a
federally
chartered
savings
association,
has
a
federal
common
law
claim
based
on
simple
negligence
against
the
former
directors
and
officers
of
that
association
for
breach
of
their
fiduciary
duty
of
care,
which
is
the
proposition
for
which
the
government
contends,
or
whether
the
fdic's
sole
federal
claim
is
the
statutory
claim
for
gross
negligence
under
12
u.s.c.
section
1821(k),
which
is
the
proposition
for
which
we
contend.
that
latter
provision
was
adopted
as
part
of
the
financial
institution
reform,
recovery,
and
enforcement
act
of
1989,
otherwise
known
as
firrea.
although
a
divided
panel
of
the
third
circuit
found
that
1821(k)
does
not
even
apply
to
federally
chartered
depository
institutions,
the
government
has
conceded
in
this
court
that
it
does.
where
petitioner
and
the
government
part
company
is
on
the
question
of
whether
the
fdic
has
a
preexisting
federal
common
law
claim
for
simple
negligence
and,
if
it
does,
whether
that
claim
was
displaced
by
section
1821(k).
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
yes,
justice
o'connor,
they
did...
they--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--no,
we
did
not.
we
argued
to
the
third
circuit,
which
argument
occurred
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
o'melveny
and
myers,
that
under
that
decision
there
was
no
general
federal
common
law
right
of
action
that
accrued
prior
to
the
enactment
of
firrea.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
yes,
i
do.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
in
the...
the
second
of
the
two
questions
presented
in
the
cert
petition
is
as
follows,
quote,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
concluding
that
section
1821(k)...
and
i'm
leaving
out
some
descriptive
language
of
that
now...
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
rtc
actions
against
officers
and
directors
of
failed
federally
chartered
fdic
insured
institutions,
and
that
the
liability
of
officers
and
directors
of
such
institutions
is
instead
governed
exclusively
by
federal
common
law.
the
second
of
the
reasons
for
granting
the
writ
which
was
set
forth
at
page
8
of
the
petition
is,
quote,
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
federal
common
law
instead
of
section
1821(k)
supplies
the
applicable
law
in
this
case
violates
this
court's
longstanding
rules
respecting
the
creation
and
application
of
such
judgemade
law,
and
finally,
section
2
of
the
petition
is
expressly
entitled,
quote,
the
third
circuit's
decision
is
in
direct
conflict
with
this
court's
prior
rulings
respecting
the
application
of
federal
common
law,
and
particularly
its
recent
decision
in
o'melveny
and
myers
v.
fdic.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
it's
our
contention
that
the
state
law
that
would
apply
in
cases
such
as
this
would
be
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
location
of
the
principal
place
of
business
of
the
association.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
new
jersey.
in
this
case,
however,
the
fdic
has
waived
its
state
law
claim.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no,
your
honor.
that
was
a
unilateral
voluntary
action
taken
by
the
fdic
and
articulated
in
its
brief
to
the
district
court
below
when
the
matter
was
being
briefed
in
connection
with
the
motion
to
dismiss.
it
was
not
an
action
taken
subsequent
to
the
district
court's
order.
it
was
a
voluntary,
unilateral
decision
by
the
fdic.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not.
it
is
our--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--well,
let
me
be
clear.
it's
our
position
that
the
only
federal
law
claim
that
the
fdic
has
postreceivership
is
a
claim
for
gross
negligence
under
section
1821(k).
it
is
our
position,
however,
that
that's
not
the
only
claim
that's
available
to
the
government.
the
government
would
also
have
a
claim
under
state
law
for
simple
negligence
if
the
state
law
in
question
provided
such
a
claim.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
to
be
candid,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
why
the
fdic
waived
its
state
law
claim.
[laughter]
it's
our
position
that
the
standard
in
new
jersey
is
gross
negligence.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
i
don't
think
it
does.
i'm
sure
the
fdic
will
argue
that
it's
in
fact
simple
negligence,
but
at
this
point
it's
an
academic
issue
because
they've
waived
the
claim.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
we
would
take
the
position
there's
no
difference.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
absolutely.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
it--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--institutions?
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
for
federal
common
law
to
apply,
two
tests
have
to
be
met.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
that
would
be
predicated
upon
a
finding
that
the
criteria
for
the
application
of
federal
law,
federal
common
law
is
present,
but
that
there
is
no
conflict,
and
that
there's
no
conflict
between
the
application
of
state
law
and
federal
law
as
in
kimbell
foods,
where
this
court
held
that
the
issue
there
was
governed
by
federal
law,
but
that
there
was
no
reason
not
to
use
state
law
as
the
rule
of
federal
decision.
but
before
you
can
get
to
that
point,
you
have
to
decide
that
there's
a
uniquely
federal
interest
present.
and
it's
our
position
that
in
this
case
no
such
uniquely
federal
interest
is
present
because
this
court
has
defined
such
interest
principally
to
involve
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
united
states
and,
as
this
court
said
in
o'melveny,
the
fdic
is
not
the
united
states,
and
even
if
it
were
it,
would
be
begging
the
issue
because
the
fdic
is
asserting
claims
in
this
case
in
its
capacity
as
a
receiver
for
the
institution,
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
institution.
in
fact,
the
fdic's
position
would
not
only
require
the
application
of
federal
common
law
to
cases
where
it's
bringing
the
claims,
it
would
require
the
application
of
federal
common
law
if
the
institution
when
solvent
was
bringing
claims
like
this
against
its
directors
and
officers
or
if
a
shareholder
of
a
solvent
institution
was
bringing
a
derivative
action
where
the
fdic
itself
wouldn't
be
a
party,
where
no
united
states
entity
would
be
a
party,
where
no
united
states
funds
would
be
directly
involved,
and
where
not
even
the
insurance
fund
would
be
directly
involved.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
it's
not
only
likely,
it's
what
they
did.
they
have
adopted
a
statute,
hola,
the
homeowners
loan
act,
back
in
1933
which
has
all
kinds
of
statutory
provisions
in
it
that
talk
about
what
banks
and...
i'm
sorry,
what
s&l's
have
to
do,
how
they
conduct
their
operations
and
so
forth,
but
there's
nothing
in
that
statute
that
talks
about
a
standard
of
care
for
officers
and
directors.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
1933,
and
it...
and
we
have
had
63
years
when
congress--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--it
was
before
erie,
but
congress
has
had
every
opportunity
to
amend
the
statute
numerous
times
after
erie
and
it
hasn't
done
so,
and--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--well,
it
might
have
thought
that
there
was
a
state
common
law,
but
it
would
have
been
hard
to
think
that
there
was
a
federal
common
law.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
i
agree,
but--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
court's
decision
in
herrmann
v.
edwards
and
whittemore
v.
amoskeag
bank,
the
court
made
it
clear
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
an
assertion
by
shareholders
of
a
national
bank
against
its
directors
and
officers
for
mismanagement
was
not
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
a
federal
cause
of
action
where
the
assertion
was
made
under
common
law.
now,
i
think
the
court
was
saying
in
that
case,
this
is
a
case
for
the
application...
in
those
two
cases,
those
are
cases
for
the
application
of
state
law,
not
federal
law.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
was
a
federal
common
law
pre-erie
in
this
area,
yes,
erie
demolishes
it.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no,
it
would
be
state
law
where
the
principal
place
of
business
was
located,
and
i
would
point
your
honor
to
the
recent
regulation
promulgated
by
the
office
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
which
regulates
all
nationally
chartered
banks.
they
recently
adopted
a
regulation
which
is
cited
in
our--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
i
don't
think
you
do.
i
think
that--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--i--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--no.
i
think
you
do
it
by
reference
to
state
law.
for
example,
in
1821(k)--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--i
understand
that,
but
in
1821(k)
congress
itself
said,
define
gross
negligence
under
applicable
state
law.
congress
itself
indicated
it
had
no
interest
in
having
some
federal
uniform
standard
apply
here.
and
by
the
same
token,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
the
institution
happens
to
have
gotten
its
charter
from
the
federal
government
is
not
sufficient
to
predicate
the
creation
of
an
entire
body
of
federal
common
law,
which
would--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
it's...
it's
my...
i--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--i
can't
say
definitively,
but
that's
not
the
issue
that's
in
front
of
the
court,
and
it
could
be
resolved
below.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
if
it's
necessary
to
establish
a
uniform
federal
rule
that
says
it's
the
principal
place
of
business,
i
suppose
the
court
could
do
that,
although
it
strikes
me
that
that's
antithetical
to
the--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--well,
i
guess
i
get
it
from
the
fact
that
the
rule
in
most
states
is
that,
that
that's
the
rule
in
the
model
business
code,
that
that's
the
rule
that--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--the
occ
has
indicated--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--it
is,
but
that
rule
wouldn't
be
applicable
here.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
that's
correct,
but
i
think
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
historically
the
reason
they
looked
to
the
state
law
of
incorporation
was
because
that
was
where
the
principal
place
of
business
was.
now,
it's
true
that
over
time
that's
changed,
and
as
delaware
passed
laws
that
made
it
more
receptive
to
corporations,
more
and
more
corporations
incorporated
there
even
though
their
principal
places
of
business
were
elsewhere,
but
the
concept
here
to
my
way
of
thinking
is
that
the
federal
government,
the
only
federal
banking
agencies
that's
indicated
any
thoughts
on
this
has
said
the
principal
place
of
business
is
fine.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
i
would...
i
would
agree
with
that
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no,
you
don't.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no,
you
do
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
i
think
you'd
look
to
state
conflicts
laws.
i
mean,
congress
has
made
it
clear
you're
supposed
to
determine
that
issue
according
to
applicable
state
law.
however
you
would
go
about
doing
that
is...
congress
didn't--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
right,
in
my--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--new
jersey
in
my--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--new
jersey--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
that's
correct,
which
i
think
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
policy
behind
firrea
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
this
court,
in
de
la
questa,
said
that
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
which
has
been
succeeded
by
the
ots,
has
plenary
authority
over
federally
chartered
thrifts.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
i
think
that
the
ots
would
have
authority
to
promulgate
regulations,
all
kinds
of
regulations
related
to
the
internal
operations
by
saying
you
can
only
make
loans
that
have
this
loan-to-value
ratio,
or
you
have
to
have
this
kind
of
collateral.
they
could
establish
standards
of
conduct
for
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
operations
of
the
institution.
i
don't
believe
that
they
could
articulate
a
standard
that
would
create
a
federal
common
law
standard
of
liability
for
application
in
federal
court
actions,
civil
court
actions,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
congress
in
section
1818(b)(6)(a),
which
was
part
of
firrea,
has
provided
an
administrative
remedy
for
all
the
federal
banking
agencies
to
pursue
claims
against
federal
and
state-chartered
institution
thrifts
and
directors,
and
to
recover
losses
from
those
individuals
incurred
as
a
result
of
their
misconduct.
but
in
that
statutory
provision
congress
has
said
that
such
recoveries
can
only
be
had
where
there
is
a
showing
of
either
unjust
enrichment
or
reckless
disregard.
congress
imposed
that
statutory
standard,
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
federal
banking
agencies
has
the
authority
to
adopt
a
less
stringent
standard
than
that
in
the
face
of
congress
having
spoken.
i
think
that's
what
a
number
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court
indicate.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
that
administrative
remedy
is
available
to
the
agencies
when
the
institution
is
solvent
at
any
time.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
21(k)?
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
the
savings
clause
in
this
statute
doesn't
help
the
government
here
for
several
reasons.
what
the
savings
clause
says
is
that
nothing
in
this
paragraph
shall
impair
or
affect
any
right
of
the
fdic
under
other
applicable
law.
other
applicable
law
can't
be
read
in
a
way
that
renders
the
first
sentence
of
1821(k)
inoperative.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
it
isn't...
it
doesn't
render
the
language
inoperable
with
respect
to
state-chartered
institutions.
it
does
with
respect
to
federally
chartered
institutions
if
you
assume
the
existence
of
a
federal
common
law
simple
negligence
claim.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
absolutely
correct.
i...
we
do
not
contend
that
the
savings
clause
precludes
the
government
from
asserting
a
claim
for
simple
negligence
under
applicable
state
law.
that
is
not
our
contention.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no,
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that
for
this--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--for
this
reason.
in
city
of
milwaukee,
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
made
there
was
that
there
was
a
statutory
section
that
dealt
with
citizen
suits,
and
there
was
a
provision
in
that
section
that
said
that
any
person
was
preserved
the
right
to
assert
any
remedy
under
state
or
common
law,
and
that
respondent
in
that
case
argued...
petitioner
in
that
case
argued
that
that
savings
clause
preserved
federal
common
law.
the
court
rejected
that
argument
and
said
at
most...
at
most,
that
language
only
provided
that
that
section
dealing
with
citizen
rights
didn't
have
the
effect
of
impacting
a
claim
under
common
law,
but
that
didn't
mean
that
the
comprehensive
nature
of
the
act
as
a
whole
didn't
displace
federal
common
law,
number
1,
and
number
2,
it
made
the
comment
that
the
term
common
law
as
used
in
that
savings
clause
was
highly
unlikely
to
have
meant
the
specific
narrowly
construed
federal
common
law
as
opposed
to
the
more
generic
state
common
law.
in
this
statutory
provision,
the
savings
clause
doesn't
even
use
the
phrase,
common
law,
and
in
our
brief
we
point
to
a
number
of
statutory
provisions
where
when
congress
wanted
to
save
federal
common
law
it
did
so
expressly.
here,
the
only
phrase
used
is
other
applicable
law,
and
we
think
that
means
federal
statutory
law,
state
statutory
law,
state
common
law,
which
is
the
routine
common
law,
but
not
the
narrow,
specific,
rarely
invoked
federal
common
law.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
that
is
our
position.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
your
honor.
our
position
is
there
never
was
a
federal
common
law
claim.
there
isn't
now.
our
alternative
argument
is,
should
the
court
determine
that
there
was
a
preexisting
federal
common
law
claim
for
simple
negligence
that
existed
prior
to
the
adoption
of
firrea,
then
congress'
reference
to
gross
negligence
standard
in
that
statutory
provision
displaces
that
preexisting
federal
common
law,
and
that
preexisting
federal
common
law
is
not
preserved
by
the
savings
clause,
so
it's
an
alternative
argument.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
i
think
that's--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
yes.
if
that's
where
your
question
was
coming
from,
your
honor,
then
i
misunderstood
the
question,
and
i
would
agree
with
justice
souter.
if
the--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--i
don't
believe
so.
there
are
state
banking
provisions
under
the
law
of
new
jersey,
but
i
don't
know
that...
i
don't
think
that
they...
they
would
be
preempted
by
federal
regulations
on
the
same
subject
matter.
they
do
have
general
statutory
provisions
that
establish
a
duty
of
care
for
officers
and
directors
of
banking
corporations,
which
would
be
applicable.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
your
honor--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--yes.
we
are...
we
did
argue
at
the
district
court
level
that
federal
law
governed.
we
did
make
that
argument,
and
we
have
reversed
our
position
since
then,
but
we
reversed
it
at
the
third
circuit
level
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
o'melveny
and
myers,
not
because
the
law
fundamentally
changed
with
that
decision,
to
be
honest,
but
because
that
decision
focused
attention
on
the
fact...
on
the
importance
of
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
general
federal
common
law,
and
we
argued
to
the
third
circuit
that
the
government's
position
was
wrong
because
it
had
no
general
federal
common
law
claim.
the
third
circuit
was
in
error.
what
we
did
concede
is
that
the
only
thing
at
issue
in
that
case,
because
they
had
waived
their
state
law
claim,
was,
what
was
the
nature
of
their
federal
law
claim?
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
your
honor,
it's
true
that
that
case
involved
a
state-chartered
institution,
but
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
general
federal
common
law,
the--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--well,
as
i
said,
it's
true
that
the
facts
of
that
case
involved
a
state-chartered
institution,
but
the
propositions
articulated
by
the
court
at
the
beginning
of
that
opinion
i
don't
believe
are
limited
by
the
fact
that
the
institution
in
that
case
was
state-chartered.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
you
have
to
have
unique
federal
interests
present
and
a
conflict,
a
significant
conflict
between
the
application
of
state
law
and
some
identifiable
federal
purpose
is
unique
to
state-chartered
institutions.
i
think
that
standard
applies
for
the
creation
of
federal
common
law
no
matter
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fdic
is
saying,
as
a
matter
of
policy
we
have
to
have
uniformity.
that's
its
argument
in
this
court.
in
fdic
v.
thall,
a
decision
which
came
down
in
august
of
1996
of
this
year
from
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
fdic
argued
and
prevailed
exactly
the
opposite
proposition,
that
state
law
should
apply
to
federally
chartered
institutions.
they
took
the
position
in
that
case
that
the
application
of
the
internal
affairs
doctrine
to
federally
chartered
institutions
was,
and
i
quote
from
their
brief,
which
is
cited
at--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--we
changed
our
position
on
the
basis
of
a
change
in
the
law.
theirs
is
a
policy
argument.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
no.
he
uses
an
internal
affairs...
the
internal
affairs--
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
--doctrine.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
well,
that's...
he
still
used
it,
but
he's...
i
believe...
to
the
extent
that
he
indicated
it's
not
applicable,
i
agree
with
him.
the
second
point
is
that...
that
the
ots
standard
that
they're
talking
about
has
nothing
to
do
with
simple
negligence.
the...
the...
well,
the...
first
of
all,
1818(i)
is
a
civil
money
penalty
provision.
it's
a
provision
for
imposing
a
penalty,
but
the
provision
that
deals
with
conduct
precisely
analogous
to
that
at
issue
here
is
not
a
civil
money
penalty
section.
it's
not
a
fining
section.
it's
1818(b)(6)(a),
which
is
the
section
which
gives
the
agencies
to
recover
losses
incurred
by
the
institutions,
federal
or
state
chartered,
caused
by
directors
and
officers,
and
the
standard
for
recovery
there
is
not
simple
negligence.
congress
set
the
standard
at
unjust
enrichment
or
reckless
disregard.
mr.
ronald
w.
stevens
1818(b)(6)(a).
