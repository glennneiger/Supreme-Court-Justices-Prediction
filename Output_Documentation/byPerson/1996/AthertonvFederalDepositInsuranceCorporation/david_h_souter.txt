h.

do
you--
--if
the
state
law
issue...
the
state
law
standard
were,
let's
say,
intentional
negligence,
you
would
still
concede
that
there
was
a
gross
negligence
claim
under
(k),
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
even
on
justice
scalia's
analysis,
you've
still
got
to
have
a
basis
for
looking
to
some
state
law
somewhere,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
boils
down
to
this,
that
in
addition
to
the
o'melveny
standard,
there's
another
source
of
federal
common
law
here,
and
the
source
is
something
like
necessity.
if
there's
got
to
be
a
basis
for
court
dealing
with
a
federally
chartered
institution,
to
say
what
law
applies,
there
is
of
necessity
a
federal
common
law
to
the
extent
of
deriving
a
pointing
rule,
and
you're
saying,
i
think,
the
necessity
here
is
that
federal
laws
say
that
you
look
to
the
state
of
principal
place
of
business.
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
well,
do
we
have
to
determine
in
this
case
before
us
which
state
law
is
applicable--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
position
is
that
there
is
no
substantive
federal
common
law,
no
common
law
governing
the
substantive
standard
of
liability.
it
is
consistent
with
your
argument
that
there
might
be
a
federal
pointer
law
telling
you
where
you
look,
what
state
you
look
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
what
justice
breyer's
question
was
assuming,
and
i
would
have
supposed
that
the
milwaukee
case
did
not
deal
with
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
the
milwaukee
case
was
dealing
with
substantive
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
would...
then
would
you
change
your
answer
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bress,
those
duties
govern
the
relationship
between
the
regulator
and
the
bank,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
ots
purport
to
be
governing
the
relationship
between
the
bank
and
its
shareholders?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
says
it
shouldn't
depend
on
the
quirks
of
state
law,
and
yet
under
o'melveny
don't
we
have
to
see
whether
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
federal
interest
and
the
state
law,
and
it
has
been
virtually
conceded
here
that
the
law
of
every
state
on
this
point
is
ordinary
negligence.
why,
then,
do
we
have
an
occasion
to
look
to
this
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
displacing
that
law
presumably
in
favor
of
a
standard
substantively
which
is
different
from
the
state
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
the
case
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
i
think
where
we
got
confused
is
that
the
state
common
law
was
ordinary
negligence,
but
the
state
insulating
statutes
supplanted
common
law
and
that's
why
we
got--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
common
law,
then.
you're
saying
there's
a
statutory
preemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you're
saying
its
right
in
the
statute
and
that's
all
that
ots
is
doing,
then
aren't
you
saying
there's
a
preemption?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
close
do
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
that
would
be
a
much
stronger
argument,
i
would
suppose,
if
this
statute
had
never
been
passed.
yes.
because
if
(k)
had
never
been...
if
subsection
(k)
had
rever
been
enacted,
then
if
i
follow
your
argument
i
would
say,
well,
there's
an
area
which
is
analogous
to
something
covered
by
the
statute
that
ots
is
administering,
but
that
statute
doesn't
cover
it
literally,
and
therefore
i
could
say,
well,
there's
a
place
where
there
seems
to
be
a
conflict
between
perceived
federal
interest
and
state
common
law,
and
therefore
we
better
develop
some
federal
common
law
for...
to
govern
that.
but
this
statute
has
been
passed
which
in
effect
is
saying
that
in
the
area
of
possibly
perceived
conflict
the
threshold
of
gross
negligence
is
good
enough,
so
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
occasion
to
develop
a
common
law
to
supplement
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
how
do
you
get
a
congressional
policy
for
uniformity?
you've
just
said
congress
took
no
position
as
to
what
was
the
correct
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
correct,
how
do
you
conclude
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
and
other
questions
that
somehow
there
is
a
congressional
indication
somewhere,
(e),
(i),
or
anyway,
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
uniform
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
congress.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
you're--
