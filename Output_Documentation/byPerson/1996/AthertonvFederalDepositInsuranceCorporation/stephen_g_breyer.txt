yes,
but
it
doesn't
if
what
you
just
said
is
the
case.
that
is,
if
federal
common
law
is,
look
to
the
state
where
the
principal
place
of
business
exists,
then
it
means
just
what
justice
o'connor
said,
and
what
we
would
do
if
the
principal
place
of
business
is
new
jersey,
and
if
new
jersey
has
a
statute
of
simple
negligence,
this
statute
would
retain
that
cause
of
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
also
that
would
be
true
if,
as
you've
just
said,
the
federal
law
is
that
we
look
to
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
principal
place
of
business
of
the
federally
incorporated
bank
exists.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
exactly
my
question,
to
be
less
elliptical,
is
what
is
the
practical
federal
interest
here
that
requires
a
federal
common
law
that
could
not
be
served
as
well
by
a
federal
common
law
pointer
rule
that
said,
simply
apply
the
law
of
the
state,
a
principal
place
of
business,
or
the
model
business
code?
in
other
words,
the
things
that
were
cited.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
that
last
part.
i
want
to
be...
assume
i'm
with
you.
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
1821(k)
leaves
federal
common
law
where
it
found
it,
all
right.
that's
base.
now,
where
did
it
find
it,
and
what
you're
saying
is,
it
found
it
(a)
a
rule
of
law
that
points
you
to
the
principle
place
of
business,
no.
you
say
no,
correct?
it
doesn't
point
you
to
the
law
of
the
principal
place
of
business.
rather,
it
creates
its
own
standards.
so
i
say,
what
leads
you
to
think
that?
and
now
you're
only
reply
to
that
is
to
source...
is
to
cite
primarily
is
1818(e)
and
(i),
and
1818(e)
and
(i),
from
my
finding
it
here,
are
these
infinitely
long
page-full
procedural
requirements
that
go
on
endlessly
that
i
can't
find
anything
that
seems
to
be
relevant,
except
for
one
sentence
that
refers
to
gross
or
continuing
disregard,
or
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we,
this
court
had
not.
this
court
had
not.
