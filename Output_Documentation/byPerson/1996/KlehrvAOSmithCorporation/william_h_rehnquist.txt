chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-663,
marvin
klehr
v.
a.
o.
smith
corporation.
mr.
bird.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
your
clients
were
incredibly
obtuse
not
to
have
discovered
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
other
statute
of
limitations
works
that
way,
where
the
statute
has
run
and
then
someone
does
something
again
and
somehow
it's
all...
the
statute
has
ceased
running.
i
mean,
ordinarily
you
would
have,
if
there's
a
4-year
statute
of
limitations
and
i
libel
you
or
i
do
something,
it's...
the
4
years
expires.
if
i
libel
you
again,
it's
a
new
cause
of
action,
a
new...
but
you
can't
resurrect
the
old
libel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
havens
was
an
unusual
case.
the
court
acknowledged
as
much,
didn't
it?
i
suspect
it's
not
likely
to
be
repeated.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bird.
mr.
ennis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
fraudulent
concealment,
you
don't
necessarily
need
a
new
injury.
that
can
toll
the
statute
of
limitations,
can't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
second
question
presented
is
whether
respondent's
fraudulent
self-concealing
conduct,
acts
of
fraudulent
concealment,
suspend
the
statute
of
limitations,
so
at
least
that
portion
of
the
fraud
claim
is
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
mr.
bird,
you
have
about
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bird.
the
case
is
submitted.
