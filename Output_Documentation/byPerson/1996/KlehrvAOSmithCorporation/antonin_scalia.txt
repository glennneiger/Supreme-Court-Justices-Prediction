justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
assuming...
when
you
say
that
all
of
the
elements
don't
have
to
be
present
at
the
beginning,
you're
assuming
that
if
i
am
injured
by
the
first
of
three
predicate
acts
i
have
suffered
a
rico
injury,
aren't
you?
i
mean,
i
agree
if
i'm
injured
by
the
second
of
three
predicate
acts
i
have
suffered
a
rico
injury,
but
we've
never
held
that
the
person
who
is
injured
by
the
first
of
what
later
becomes
a
series
of
predicate
acts
has
suffered
a
rico
injury,
have
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
necessary
to
the
theory
of
statute
of
limitations
you're
pressing
upon
us,
however.
the
argument
you
were
just
making
assumes
that,
assumes
that
the
first
injury
constitutes
a
rico
injury
even
though
at
that
time
there's
no
pattern
and
you
have
not
been
injured,
when
you're
injured,
by
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
have
that
problem
if
i
wouldn't
allow
the
first
suit,
right?
you're
back
to
that
issue
again,
whether
the
first
person
has
a
rico
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
give
you
10
years,
not
30.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
the
distance
between
the
first
predicate
act
and
the
second,
so
the
person
who
is
injured
10
years
later
after
the
first
one
clearly
has
a
rico
cause
of
action,
and
the
first
predicate
act
occurred
10
years
ago.
that's
the
outside
time
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bird,
i
agree
that
all
of
the
elements
have
to
have
been
in
existence,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
but
why
do
you
think
all
of
the
elements
have
to
be
known,
including
the
existence
of
the
pattern?
let's
take,
you
know,
a
garden
variety
tort
action
for
a
physical
injury
to
someone.
suppose
the
physical
injury
occurs.
doesn't
the
statute
begins
to
run
immediately?
and
let's
assume
the
injury
was
intentional
so
that
the
individual
could
sue
for
assault,
but
he
didn't
know
it
was
intentional
at
the
time.
he
just
thought
it
was
negligent.
now,
he
later
finds
out,
3
years
later,
that
it
was
in
fact
intentional.
does
he
have
a
longer
statute
of
limitations
for
assault
than
he
would
have
had
for
negligence,
assuming
the
jurisdiction
has
the
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
same
2-year
statute
for
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
his
problem.
indeed,
he
didn't
know
that
it
was
intentional,
and
that
made
it
a
higher
species
of
tort,
just
as
the...
a
series
of
rico
violations
makes
this
a
higher
species
of
tort,
but
that's
too
bad,
so
once
he
learned
of
the
injury
he
should
have
sued.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
argument
was
raised
in
malley-duff.
i
mean,
i
raised
it,
in
fact.
you
know,
i...
in
a
dissent
i
said
there
shouldn't
be
a
statute
of
limitations
for
rico.
you
either
use
the
state
statute
or
use
none
at
all
in
this
case.
that
was
rejected,
however.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
adopted
a
4-year
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
it
has
to
have
some
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
has
no
meaning
if
in
justice
breyer's
hypo
the
thing
can
be
rejuvenated
every
5
years,
every
time
there's
a
new
predicate
act.
even
though
the
4-year
statute
has
already
passed
since
the
last
predicate
act,
as
soon
as
there's
a
new
predicate
act
1
year
later
the
whole
thing
comes
to
life
again.
that's
not
a
statute
of
limitations
of
any
sort
that
i
ever
heard
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
he
changes
his
mind
5
years
later,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
last
predicate
act?
you're
saying
that
there
is
a
new
predicate
act
every
time
the
person
who
has
committed
a
fraud
denies
that
he's
committed
a
fraud--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
tells
the
seller,
that's
a
perfectly
good
silo?
is
that
a
new
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
a
new
predicate
act?
the
seller
has
the
$64
thou.
it's
in
his
pocket.
he's
not
getting
any
more
money.
why
is
there
a
new
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
sales
to
other
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
charged
for
these
repairs?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
made
a
profit
on
it,
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
made
a
profit
on
these
repairs?
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
concerned
with...
your
brief
makes
this
point
both
for
extending
the
rico
statute
and
also
for
asserting
that
even
if
we
don't
adopt
your
position
as
to
the
last
predicate
act
there
was
in
fact
a
new
and
separate
injury
when
these
later...
when
these
later--
justice
antonin
scalia
--representations
were
made,
a
new
accrual,
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i'd
like
you
to
do
that.
that's
what
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
that
in
furtherance
of
a
fraud?
the
fraud
has
already
occurred.
it's
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
answered
no.
i
thought
the
answer
was
it
was
intended
to
conceal
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
it
concealment
simply
to
deny
that
the
product
sold
earlier
was
defective?
that's
a
pretty
lose
definition
of
concealment.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
keep
on
insisting
no,
that's
a
perfectly
good
silo,
that
is
concealment?
i
can
understand
if
you
say
well,
you
know,
they
doctored
reports
about
whether
the
cattle
were
sick
or
something
like
that.
that
is
concealment.
but
just
insisting
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
silo,
that's
concealment?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
4
years
if
you
know
both
the
injury
and
the
source.
presumably
the
4
years
is
intended
to
give
you
time
after
you've
discovered
the
injury
to
find
the
source.
justice
antonin
scalia
otherwise
we
could
have
a
1-month
statute
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
there's
no
actual
concealment
here?
certainly
one
of
the
elements
of
fraud
is
that
you
knew
that
the
product
you
sold
was
not
going
to
do
what
you
said
it
did,
otherwise
it's
just
negligence,
and
you're
subject
to
breach
of
warranty,
i
suppose,
but
not
to
a
fraud
claim.
now,
didn't
the
seller
here,
a.
o.
smith,
indicate
that
it
did...
it
believed
that
this
silo
was
a
properly
working
silo?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
isn't
that
concealment
of
the
element
of
knowledge
that
it
wasn't
a
properly
working
silo?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
it
does.
when
you
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
there's
concealment
or
not,
you're
assuming
there
was
a
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
retreating
to
the
second
item
that
you
raised
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer,
namely
that
even
where
there
is
concealment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
does
not
excuse
you
if
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
it
doesn't
work
to
the
plaintiff's
advantage
if
a
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
discovered
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
a
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
discovered
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
didn't
understand
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
there's
concealment.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
so
odd
that
i'm
inclined,
if
you
really
believe
that,
to
think
that
the
4-year
statute
of
limitations
should
be
interpreted
with
similar
oddity.
[laughter]
what
good
is
a
4-year
statute
of
limitations
if
you
don't
know
for
even
10
years
until--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
you
have...
before
you
have
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
quite
serious
that
my
view
of
the
statute
of
limitations
has
to
depend
to
some
extent
upon
my
view
of
what
rico
does,
and
if
there
is
in
every
case
a
10-year,
i
don't
know,
limbo
period--
justice
antonin
scalia
known
to
be
false
by
the
seller.
you
have
to
add
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
must
add
that
for
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
--although
you
acknowledge
that
it
can
be
tied
to
an
injury
to
somebody
else
if
the
injured
plaintiff
is
the
first
one
in
the
series
of
rico
acts.
in
that
situation,
you
don't
insist
on
injury
to
this
plaintiff.
you
will
wait
10
years
to
see
if
any
other
plaintiff
is
injured.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
even
have
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
so
to
that
extent
you're
willing
to
buy
into
the
criminal
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if
congress
was
reading
our
cases
it
would
not
have
expected
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
to
apply
at
all,
much--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
came
to
that
later,
didn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
think
it's
very
helpful
to
talk
about
what
congress
intended.
