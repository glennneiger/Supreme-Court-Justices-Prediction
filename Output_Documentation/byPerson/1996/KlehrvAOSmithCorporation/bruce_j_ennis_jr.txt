mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
majority
of
the
circuits
have
decided
that
the
most
appropriate
accrual
rule
for
civil
rico
claims
is
the
same
discovery
of
injury
rule
that
federal
courts
use
for
civil
claims
in
general.
that
is
a
particularly
sensible
rule
for
civil
rico
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
rule
focuses
on
injury,
which
congress
made
the
distinguishing
element
of
a
civil
rico
claim.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
not
at
all.
under
the
basic
rule
that
we
are
proposing,
the
cause
of
action
accrues
when
all
the
elements
of
a
civil
rico
claim
exist,
whether
the
plaintiff
knows
all
the
elements
or
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
and
the
plaintiff
has
discovered
injury.
that's
the
rule
we
propose,
which
is
the
basic
discovery
of
injury
rule.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
general
rule
for
the
discovery-of-injury
rule.
all
the
circuits
that
have
used
the
discovery-of-injury
rule,
and
that's
the
majority,
have
interpreted
that
rule
to
mean
that
the
cause
of
action
accrues
when
all
the
elements
exist
and
the
plaintiff
discovers
or
should
reasonably
have
discovered
his
injury.
discovery
of
injury
is
sufficient
to
induce
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
to
investigate
the
cause
of
the
injury
and
to
determine
all
the
elements
needed
to
plead
the
claim
within
the
4-year
period.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
there
are
two
aspects
to
your
question,
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
first,
if
you're
asking,
what
if
there's
one
act
that
injures
the
plaintiff
but
there's
not
a
second
or
third
predicate
act
constituting
a
pattern
yet,
i
think
that's
not
really
a
question
of
accrual.
that's
a
question,
a
substantive
question
of
what
constitutes
a
rico
claim.
the
rule
we
propose
would
apply
equally
whichever
way
the
court
resolves
that
question.
but
the
other
part
of
your
question
touches
on
the
doctrine
of
separate
accrual,
and
there,
too,
we
propose
the
traditional
federal
rule
of
separate
accrual
which
nine
circuits
have
applied
to
civil
rico
claims,
and
under
that
rule,
as
state
farm
recognized
and
other
courts
recognized,
the
separate
accrual
rule
means
that
when
there
are
new
separate
and
different
injuries
within
the
limitations
period,
that
will
start
a
new
claim,
a
new
cause
of
action.
that
rule
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
because
both
lower
courts,
viewing
the
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
petitioners,
concluded
that
petitioners
suffered
no
new
injuries
within
4
years
of
suit,
in
fact,
no
injuries
within
6
years
of
suit--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--so
the
separate
accrual
rule
does
not
help
these
petitioners.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
to
be
as
candid
as
i
can,
i
think
there's
confusion
in
the
lower
courts
on
whether
the
discovery-of-injury
rule
means
discovery
of
the
injury
or,
as
a
few
courts
have
said,
discovery
of
the
injury
and
the
source
of
the
injury,
meaning
who
caused
it.
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts
say
the
discovery-of-injury
rule
means
discovery
of
injury.
i
think
that's...
your
opinion
for
the
d.c.
circuit
in
conners
noted
that
point,
and
that
should
be
sufficient
to
induce
a
reasonably
diligent
person
to
find
out
the
source
and
all
the
other
elements
of
the
injury.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
scalia--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
that's
completely
correct,
and
is
the
reason
why
the
other
competing
rule,
the
discovery-of-injury
and
discovery-of-pattern
rule
is
not
as
appropriate
for
civil
rico
as
the
rule
we
propose.
once
you
have
discovered
both
that
you
have
been
injured
and
by
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
there's
no
reason
to
give
you
an
additional
4
years
after
you
know
all
that
you
know,
need
to
know
in
order
to
file
a
claim.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
could
be,
justice
souter.
of
course,
not
all
rico
actions
involve
fraud.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
they
could
involve
arson,
or
embezzlement.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
when
it
does.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
means
discovery
of
the
acts,
which
in
law
would
constitute
a
fraud.
but
there's
another...
your
question
raises
another
good
reason
to
apply
the
general
discovery-of-injury
rule,
because
that
rule
has
been
found
to
be
a
fair
and
workable
rule
when
applied
in
a
very
wide
variety
of
circumstances
to
a
wide
variety
of
acts,
and
that
makes
real
sense
in
civil
rico,
given
the
enormous
variety
of
acts
that
can
constitute
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
start
to
run.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
breyer,
that
is
the
clayton
act
rule,
the
basic
clayton
act
rule.
the
cause
of
action
accrues
upon
the
occurrence
of
the
injury
even
if
the
plaintiff
has
no
knowledge
that
he
has
been
injured.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
a
different
doctrine.
now,
let
me
try
to
address
that
doctrine.
the
doctrine
of
fraudulent
concealment
is
not
applicable
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
for
two
reasons.
all
courts
agree...
all
courts
agree
that
the
doctrine
only
applies
when
the
defendant's
acts
actually
conceal
the
elements
of
the
claim.
there's
a
distinction
between
whether
they
can
be
self-concealing
acts
or
affirmative
acts
that
conceal,
but
all
courts
agree
the
defendant's
acts
must
conceal
the
elements
of
the
claim.
here,
both
lower
courts
found,
viewing
the
evidence
most
favorably
to
petitioners,
defendants
did
not
commit
any
acts
which
concealed
the
elements
of
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
if
there
is
actual
fraudulent
concealment,
which
has
two
components,
first
that
the
defendant's
acts
actually
concealed--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--the
elements
of
the
claim.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
was
not
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
second,
that's
not
this
case
for
a
second
reason.
both
lower
courts
found,
and
in
fact
nine
circuits,
at
least
nine
circuits
agree,
that
even
when
the
defendant's
acts
do
actually
conceal
the
elements
of
the
claim,
the
plaintiff
must
nevertheless
be
diligent,
and
if
a
diligent
plaintiff
would
nevertheless
have
discovered
the
elements
of
the
claim
despite
the
defendant's
acts
of
fraudulent
concealment,
the
doctrine
of
fraudulent
concealment
does
not
apply.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
absolutely,
justice--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--first
of
all,
as
justice
kennedy's
question
earlier
suggested,
that
question
assumes
that
it
is
fraud,
and
that
my
client,
a.
o.
smith,
knows
that
the
silos
won't
work.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
in
this
case
the
reason
it
doesn't
conceal,
even
if
you
assume
it's
a
fraud,
is
that
the
claims
here
are
based
on
allegations
that
my
client
misrepresented
the
benefits
of
this
silo.
b-2
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
lists
the
alleged
misrepresentations.
the
lower
courts
found
that
long
before,
6
years
before
they
filed,
petitioners
should
have
known
that
all
of
the
representations
on
which
they
claim
to
rely
had
not
materialized,
and
there
was
nothing
the
defendants
could
do
to
conceal
that
reality.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
maybe
i
didn't
express
myself
as
clearly
as
i--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i'm
trying
to
address
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there's
no
concealment
at
all,
because
there
is
nothing
the
defendant
did
or
could
do
that
could
conceal
from
the
petitioners
that
the
representations
on
which
they
relied
were
not
materializing.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
souter,
they
claim...
if
you
look
at
b-2
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
they
claim
that
the...
the
representations
which
they
alleged
were
fraudulent
included
representations
that
this
silo
would
make
it
possible
for
them
to
eliminate
protein
supplements.
they
knew
that
never
happened.
that...
one
of
the
misrepresentations
was
that
they
would
be
able
to
increase
their
milk
production
3
to
5
pounds
of
milk
per
cow
a
day.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
never
happened.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
souter,
no
one
ever
knows
for
sure
whether
a
defendant
in
a
fraud
case
knows
that
claims
are
true
or
untrue
until
you've
brought
the
trial
and
win
or
lose.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
both
lower
courts,
answering
that
second
question,
which
was
the
second
question
in
justice
scalia's
question,
by
concluding
that
doing
the
evidence
most
favorably
for
the
petitioners
they
knew
or
should
have
known
all
of
the
elements
of
their
rico
claim,
including
that
this
was
fraud--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--if
it
was
fraud,
more
than
6
years
before--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
this
case
involves
a
lot
of
facts
not
all
of
which
are
in
the
cert
petition
or
the
appendix,
but
after
reviewing
all
those
facts,
including
the
facts
that
the
petitioners
could
simply
have
taken
feed
from
the
silo
to
be
tested,
which
is
a
normal
regular
thing
that
most
farmers
do
at
least
twice
a
year,
which
would
have
showed
them
that
the
feed
from
the
silo
either
was
good
quality
or
bad
quality...
they
didn't
do
that.
there
were
many
things
available
to
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
whose
milk
production
was
going
down
for
19
years,
whose
protein
supplements
did
not
improve
for
19
years,
that
they
could
have
done
to
investigate
and
find
out
all
the
elements
of
their
claim.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
it's
the
same
answer,
your
honor.
it's
the
same
thing
as
if
they
say
this
is
a
great
silo.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
unless
those
new
acts
cause
separate
injuries
within
the
limitations
period.
these
did
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
this
case,
both
courts
found...
and
those
findings
i
don't
think
are
properly
before
the
court,
because
although
petitioner
in
their
brief
raises
a
question
about
whether
the
lower
courts
properly
applied
the
summary
judgment
standard
they
did
not
raise
that
question
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
eighth
circuit,
in
their
cert
petition,
the
questions
presented--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that
would
simply
be
a
continuation
of
the
damages
that
flowed
from
the
initial
fraudulent
act
if
it
was
fraudulent,
inducing
him
to
buy
the
silo.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
it's
not
a
new
injury.
it's
not
a
new,
different,
and
separate
injury,
your
honor.
that's
the...
that's
a
critical
point
in
the
separate
accrual
doctrine.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
the
general--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--if
it's
a
new
misrepresentation--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--within
4
years--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--which
causes
injury--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--within
4
years
you
could.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
fraudulent
concealment
can
toll,
if
there
are
affirmative
acts
that
actually
conceal,
if
there
are
acts
that
actually
conceal.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we
don't
dispute
that
the
fraudulent
concealment
issue
is
presented.
we
do
dispute
that
any
question
about
whether
the
lower
courts
properly
applied
the
summary
judgment
standard
is
presented.
let
me
just
make--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--again,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that's
a
substantive
question
of
rico--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--it's
different
from
the
accrual
rule.
personally,
i
think
that
the
first
person
injured
by
an
act,
the
first
predicate
act
which
later
turns
out
to
be
a
pattern,
would
have
a
civil
rico
claim
once
the
pattern
emerges.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
that's
my
personal
belief.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
at
that
point.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right,
and
i
reach
that
conclusion
because
this
is
a
remedial
statute,
and
congress
understood
that
some
of
the
patterns
could
take
as
much
as
10
years.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
is
odd,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
parallel,
and
i
don't
know
what
lower
courts
would
say
in
answer
to
that
question.
let
me
make--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--let
me--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--let
me
just...
let
me
just
note--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i'm
sure
it's
clear,
but
that
question
is
not
raised
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
the
pattern
quite
clearly
existed
well
before
the
purchase
of
the
silo
in
1974.
they
allege
there
were
at
least
20
acts
of
mail
fraud
on
which
they
relied
before
1974.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
that
wouldn't
be
true.
the
fact
that
the
pattern
might
not
emerge
for
10
years
would
not
mean
you
could
not
have
a
pattern
of
acts
some
of
which
are
every
2
or
3
years
apart
that
go
on
for
20
or
30
years.
that's
a
separate
question.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
no,
justice
stevens.
i...
if
that's
the
answer
you...
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
at
all.
the
statute
of
limitations
would
only
begin
to
run
when
there
was
discovery
of
injury
and
all
the
elements
of
a
rico
claim
were
in
existence.
now,
the
court
may
answer
that
in
existence
question
one
way
or
the
other.
our
rule
would
apply
whichever
way
the
court
answered
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
that's
correct.
now--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
there
are
two
things
i'd
like
to
say
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
that's
not
what
those
internal
studies
show.
this
company
has
sold
83,000
of
these
silos.
there
have
been
270
claims.
3/10ths
of
1
percent
have
experienced
problems.
that's
not
what
the
internal
studies
show.
but
even
if
they
did
show
that,
that
would
not
qualify
as
fraudulent
concealment
under
the
fraudulent
concealment
doctrine
that
almost
all
circuits
apply,
because
those
acts
would
do
nothing
to
prevent
the
petitioners
from
discovering
the
elements
of
their
claim.
the
elements
of
their
claim
are,
the
representations
on
which
they
relied
proved
to
be
false.
their
cows
were
not
doing
well.
they
were
injured,
and
there
was
a
pattern
of
activity.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
you
can
add
that,
justice
scalia,
if
you--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--you
have
to
be
able
to
allege
that,
that's
correct.
it
has
to
be
able
to
plead--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--now,
let
me...
i've
not
got
to
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--central
point--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i'd
like
to
make,
if
i
could,
about
why
the
criminal
rico
rule,
which
is
the
only
rule
the
petitioners
urge,
justice
souter.
they
do
not
urge
a
discovery
rule
at
all.
if
you
look
at
their
motion
for
a
divided...
response
to
the
motion
for
a
divided
argument
that's
crystal
clear.
it's
also
clear
on
pages
20
and
21
of
their
brief.
they
don't
urge
a
discovery
rule.
the
critical
problem
with
the
criminal
last
act
rule,
like
the
civil
last
predicate
act
rule,
is
that
it
would
enable
a
fully
knowledgeable
plaintiff
who
knows
everything
to
delay
filing
for
many,
many
years.
it
is
not
tied
to
the
injury
component
of
civil
rico,
because
the
last
violation
under
the
criminal
rule,
or
the
last
predicate
act
under
the
civil
rule,
don't
have
to
have
injured
the
plaintiff
at
all.
they
don't
have
to
have
injured
anyone
at
all.
now,
that
makes
no
sense
to
use
that
rule,
which
is
adrift
from
concepts
of
injury,
in
civil
rico,
where
congress
itself
determined
that
the
gravamen
of
a
civil
rico
claim
is
injury
and
a
specific
kind
of
injury,
injury
to
the
business
or
property
of
the
plaintiff.
the
fact
that
the
last
act
might
injure
someone
else
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
plaintiff's
civil
rico
claim.
that's
why
any
rule
this
court
adopts
for
civil
rico
should
be
tied
directly
to
injury.
now,
there
are
other
reasons
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--actually,
the
other
plaintiff
doesn't
even
have
to
be
injured.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
can
be
a
predicate
act.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
to
that
limited
extent,
justice
scalia,
but
in
the
normal
run
of
these
cases,
particularly
where
you're
talking
about
an
ongoing
pattern
of
activity,
the
pattern
would
exist
roughly
at
the
same
time
as
the
first
injury.
the
second
reason
why
the
rule
we
propose
makes
more
sense
than
later
accruing
rules
is
that
it
is
more
consistent
with
the
private
attorney
general
function
of
civil
rico.
the
point
of
the
private
attorney
general
function,
since
the
civil
plaintiff
can
only
recover
his
own
damages
and
cannot
punish
the
defendant
for
any
injuries
inflicted
on
others,
is
not
financial.
it's
to
expose
and
deter
ongoing
patterns
of
racketeering
activity--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--before
they
injure
others.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
clayton
rule,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we
don't
ask
for
it,
but
of
course
we'd
be
happy
with
it,
since
we
would
win
under
that
rule.
this
claim
would
have
accrued
in
1974,
and
it
would
be
barred
in
1978,
but
we
don't
urge
the
clayton
rule
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
clayton
rule,
although
that's
the
basic
clayton
rule,
that
occurrence-of-injury
rule
has
not
proved
satisfactory
even
for
all
clayton
act
violations,
which
are
much
narrower
in
scope
than
rico
violations,
so
many
clayton
courts
have
actually
imposed
different
rules,
and
we
think
it
makes
sense
to
have
a
single
rule
for
rico
that
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
all
the
acts
that
violate
rico.
second,
frankly,
we
think
that
the
clayton
rule
is
a
little
harsher
to
plaintiffs
than
this
remedial
statute
was
probably
intended
to
be.
we
think
that
what
congress
probably
presumed,
if
it
presumed
anything
at
all,
was
that
the
general
federal
accrual
rule
would
apply,
and
that
rule
is
discovery
of
injury,
and
we
don't
think
that
in
the
context
of
this
statute
there's
anything
in
the
text
or
purpose
of
rico
that
would
mean
that
congress
would
have
intended
a
harsher
rule
for
civil
rico
than
the
general
federal
rule
of
accrual.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
if
they'd
read
your
dissent,
justice
scalia.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
[laughter]
no,
but
putting
entirely
aside
congressional
intent,
in
federal
courts
it's
judge-made
law
almost
always
to
adopt
accrual
rules,
but
those
rules
are
supposed
to
be
consistent
with
and
tied
to
the
purpose
of
the
underlying
statute,
regardless
of
what
the
congressional
intent
was,
and
for
that
reason
we
think
since
civil
rico
the
distinguishing
element
is
injury,
it
should
be
discovery
of
injury
that
triggers
the
accrual.
let
me
conclude
by
saying
that
the
havens
realty
case,
which
has
been
mentioned
here
in
argument,
actually
proves
our
point.
in
havens
realty...
it
wasn't
a
unique
case,
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
havens
realty
this
court
rejected
the
continuing
violations
doctrine
when
applied
to
a
claim
that
required
proof
of
direct
injury
to
the
plaintiff,
a
misrepresentation
claim.
it
found
the
continuing
violation
doctrine
not
appropriate
in
that
circumstance,
only
appropriate
in
the
quite
different
circumstance
of
discriminatory
practices
which
have
indirect
injury
to
the
plaintiff
even
if
they
do
not
directly
injure
the
plaintiff.
that
is
not
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
