mr.
bird,
as
i
understand
it
the
principal
difference
between
your
case
and
others
is
the
principal
problem
that
you
have
is
the
identification
of
the
source,
and
in
clayton
act
cases
generally
it's
known
who
it
is,
but
here,
it
isn't
a
question
of
injury
or
pattern,
it's
a
question
of,
you
didn't
know
the
source,
and
that's
why
i
found
your
argument
rather
puzzling.
it
seemed
to
me
the
eighth
circuit
test,
which
was
injury
and
source,
discovery
of
injury
and
source
plus
pattern
was
the
rule,
and
that
your
disagreement
really
was
about
the
identification
of
the
source,
because
if
those
three
elements
are
there,
then
on...
as
i
understand
your
claim,
you
would
be
within
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
the
whole
thing
of
your
case
is
they
knew
they
were
hurt,
and
then
they
knew
that
there
had
been
all
this
advertising,
but
they
didn't
connect
the
pattern
with
the
source
of
the
injuries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bird,
i
continue
to
be
troubled
by
the
abstract
quality
of
your
discussion,
because
here
it
wasn't
every
5
years.
it
was
constant.
there
was
this
sales
pitch
going
on
constantly.
so
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
a
veterinarian
had
come
to
the
klehrs'
farm
in
1978
and
said,
you
know
what
causing
your
cattle
to
sicken?
it's
that
silo.
how
much
time
would
you
have
to
sue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
ennis,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
that
the
rule
was
the
discovery
rule
was
injury
plus
source,
not
merely
injury,
and
here,
as
i
said
to
mr.
bird,
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
problem
was
not
injury,
was
not
pattern,
but
source.
these
were
farmers
who
knew
they
had
a
terrible
problem,
but
they
didn't
know
what
caused
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ennis--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--explain
that
to
me,
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
don't
think
this
is
disputed,
these
farmers
consulted
a
veterinarian.
they
had
a
nutritionist.
they
wanted
to
know
why
their
cattle
were
sick,
and
no
one
tipped
them
off
to
a
possible
relationship
between
the
sickness
of
the
cattle
and
the
silo.
they
knew
the
silo
wasn't
working,
but
they
didn't
know
that
that's
what
caused
the
sickness
in
the
animals.
so
they
knew
they
had
a
problem.
they
consulted
people.
why
wasn't
that
diligent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
--if
all
that
is
correct...
let's
assume...
i'm
not
sure
that
this
happened.
let's
just
assume
that
within
4
years
of
the
time
the
action
was
filed
a
representative
of
the
company
came
out
and
he
looked
at
the
feed
with
the
farmer
and
he
said,
oh,
that's
that
brown
stuff,
you
want
that,
that's
really
good,
knowing
that
that's
not
true,
knowing
that
this
is
exactly
what
was
hurting
the
cattle,
would
that
have
revived
the
cause
of
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ennis,
there's
one
more
piece
of
this
about
the
discovery
of
the
source.
there
was
the
continuing
sales
pitch,
but
there
was
also,
it
was
alleged,
was
it
not,
that
the
company
had
done
testing
on
its
own,
and
that
testing
showed
that
the
silo
was
not
performing
as
advertised,
and
yet
no
one
who
had
purchased
this
silo
was
told,
your
cattle
may
sicken
and
even
die.
isn't
that
relevant
to
the
discovery
of
the
source?
