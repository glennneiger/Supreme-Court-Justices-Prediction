justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
injury
precedes
the
pattern
it's
rather
hard
to
say
that
it
was
a
rico
injury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
necessary
in
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
still
leaves
the
metaphysical
question,
or
maybe
the
legal
question
of
why
there
can
be
a
rico
injury
before
there's
a
rico
in
existence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that
assumes
the
question.
part
of
the
statute
of
limitations
design
is
so
that
people
that
are
not
guilty
of
being
in
a
criminal
activity
have
the
evidence
that's
fresh
to
rebut
your
allegation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
he
wouldn't...
that
wouldn't
help
if
the
injury
was
within
the
statutory
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
i
mean...
and
if
i
have
a
price-fixing
case
i
take
it
that
if
they've
been
engaged
in
fixing
the
prices
of
their
electrical
conduits
for
30
years
and
i've
been
hurt,
i
can
go
back
only...
is
it
3,
or
is
it...
3,
i
think.
all
right,
so
why
would
it,
if
we're
copying
the
clayton
act,
where
you
have
a
price-fixing
case
you
only
can
go
back
3
years,
but
if
it's
rico
you
can
go
back
a
million
years,
or
let's
be
honest
about
it.
you
go
back
15,
20,
whatever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--mr....
i'm
not...
i've
never
understood
this
fully,
but
i'm
not
certain
that
we
have
to
go
into...
i'm
not
certain
we
have
to
go
into
the
question
of
fraudulent...
when
you
discover
it
and...
what
is
it
called,
fraudulent
concealment,
but
if
we
do,
what
is
it
you
have
to
know?
i
received
the
letter
from
the
fake
real
estate
company
that
says,
dear
so-and-so,
your
investment
is
now
worth
nothing,
because
unfortunately
there
was
bad
conditions,
all
right?
so
i
know
that.
i
know
the
source.
does
it
start
to
run?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
you
should
have
discovered
the
fraud
earlier,
the
fact
that
there
are
new
acts
of
fraud
are...
is
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
this
continued
to
lull
them
into
thinking
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
silo
and
he
lost
10
more
cows?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just...
just
with
reference
to
my
question,
let's
assume
they
came
out
within
4
years,
said
oh,
this
is
great
feed,
knowing
that
it
wasn't,
and
that
10
more
cows
were
sick
or
died,
and
that
the
plaintiff
was
lulled
into
believing
that
the
silo
was
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
that
a
repeated
injury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
justice
breyer's
case,
where
a
bank
is
defrauding
people
on
credit
cards,
if
you
should
have
found
out
15
years
ago
but
they
keep
doing
it
you
can't
sue
for
the
last
4
years,
or
for
the
period
within
the
statute
of
limitations
since
the
new
acts
have
occurred?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
there
had--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--even
though
there
had
been
no
violation
of
rico
at
the
time--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
his
injury.
it's
retroactively
created?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
parallel
doctrine
for
that,
or
is
that
unique
to
rico?
it's
just
strange
to
me
that
a
rico
injury
happens,
and
then
the
rico
pattern
is
completed
later.
i
just
find
that
very
odd.
