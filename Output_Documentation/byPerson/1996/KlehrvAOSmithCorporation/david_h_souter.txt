justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
even
on
the
traditional
rule,
isn't
it
your
position
also
that
because
one
of
the
elements
is
fraud,
and
because
fraud
at
least
will
normally
be
accorded
a
discovery
rule,
that
therefore
you
have
until
the
point
of
reasonable
discovery,
even
under
the
traditional
rule,
or
a
traditional
analysis,
without
regard
to
the
peculiarity
of
rico
itself.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
quite
realize
that,
but
if
you
take
the
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
gave
you,
and
you
substitute
for
the
intentional
versus
negligent
act
a
fraudulent
act,
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
that
even
though
so
far
as
the
element
of
failure
to
supply
what
they
offered
or
any
conventional
tort,
as
to
that
the
statute
might
run
immediately.
nonetheless,
as
to
the
fraudulent
element
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
the
statute
would
not
run
until
the
moment
of
reasonable
discovery.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
you
may
very
well
lose
the
case
conceptually
by
the
adoption
of
a
clayton
kind
of
analysis
here,
and
yet
if
there
were
a
traditional...
if
traditional
treatment
were
given
to
the
discovery
aspect
of
the
fraudulent
element,
you
might
still
be
in
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
might
still
go
back
and
have
something
to
litigate.
justice
david
h.
souter
--they
don't
have
to
obtain
anything
further?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
don't
have
to
obtain
anything
further?
simply,
in
effect,
an
intentionally
false
statement
through
the
mail,
intended
to
conceal
their--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
enough
on
the
mail
fraud?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
just
want
the
definition
of
mail
fraud
for
the
moment.
if
they
make
the
fraudulent
representation
through
the
mail
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
their
prior
fraud,
does
that
satisfy
all
the
elements
of
mail
fraud?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
because
it
might
not
be
fraudulent.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
could
make
that
statement
thinking
they
had
a
great
silo
out
there,
and
that
wouldn't
be
mail
fraud.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
knew
the
silo
was
bad,
and
a
fortiori,
if
they
knew
at
the
time
they
sold
it
that
in
fact
it
would
not
do
what
they
represented,
then
there
would
be
a
fraudulent
concealment
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
mail
fraud
would
be
the
predicate
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
include
injury?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
speak
of
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
are
you
speaking
of
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
which
includes,
to
your
knowledge,
fraud?
in
other
words,
is
the
fraud
element
included
in
what
you
know
when
you
say
you
have
discovered
a
pattern?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
it
does.
when
it
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
discovery
of
a
pattern
is
simply,
as
you're
using
the
term,
means
discovery
of
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
only
goes
to
the
contract
description.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
misrepresentation
which
is
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action,
and
the
fact
that
more
than
6
years
before
they
brought
this
suit
they
realized
that
the
silo
was
not
working
as
advertised
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
they
knew
that
smith
had
misrepresented
the
silo's
capacity.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
when
did
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
--when
did
they
not
merely
know
that
those
representations
were
proving
to
be
untrue,
but
when
did
they
also
know
that
smith
knew
they
were
untrue
when
they
made
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
question
of
circumstantial
evidence--
justice
david
h.
souter
--like
a
great
deal
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
think
the
only
point
that
i'm
making
is,
on
the
fraudulent
concealment
rule,
it
does
not
answer
the
fraudulent
concealment
rule
issue
to
say
they
should
have
known
that
the
silo
was
not
living
up
to
its
description.
if
the
question
is,
when
should
they
have
known
that
the
silo
was
also
the
subject
of
a
fraudulent--
justice
david
h.
souter
--description
or
representation.
