mr.
charles
a.
bird
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
last
predicate,
criminal
last
predicate
act
rule
of
accrual
is
the
most
appropriate
rule
for
civil
racketeering
claims
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
takes
account
of
the
unique
elements
of
this
cause
of
action.
secondly,
it
is
consistent
with
the
congressional
objectives
and
underlying
policies
of
the
law.
third,
it
greatly
reduces
the
administrative
and
judicial
burden
and
the
economic
burden
upon
the
parties
because
of
its
ease
of
application.
selection
of
a
rule
of
accrual
in
rico
must
first
of
all
take
account
of
the
sui
generis
nature
of
this
cause
of
action
and
its
unique
pattern
element.
in
a
garden
variety
tort
case,
say
a
car
accident,
for
example,
all
of
the
elements
are
present
at
the
beginning.
this
explains
the
normal,
or
traditional
rule
of
accrual.
in
a
rico
case
this
is
not
true,
because
the
injury
must
arise
out
of
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
and
the
pattern
itself
must
also
be
perpetrated
by
a
rico
enterprise.
these--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well...
no,
this
court
has
not
held
that.
however,
i
think
an
analysis
of
what
a
pattern
of
racketeering
is
would
help
in
answering
that
question.
if
you
want
me
to
go
on
i
will,
but
my
understanding
of
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
is
that
it
is
simply
a
definition
that
can
only
be
determined
in
retrospect,
such
that
even
two
predicate
acts,
for
example,
don't
necessarily
constitute
a
pattern.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
well,
the--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--no,
it's
not
necessary
in
our
case,
but
let
me--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--if
i
may
explain,
the
way
i
view
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
the
definition
itself,
it
assumes
already
in
place,
and
the
only
way
by
definition
that
we
can
conclude
that
a
pattern
exists
is
that
we
have
a
beginning
and
that
we
have
an
end.
it
can
only
be
decided
whether
or
not
it
exists
in
retrospect.
once
we
determine
that
it
exists,
then
that
first
predicate
act
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
pattern
as
the
last
predicate
act,
and
that's
our
contention
here,
and
that's
why
trying
to
determine
when
a
rico
pattern
along
this
continuum
which
congress
has
defined
somehow
is
borne
or
springs
to
life,
if
you
will,
under
the
h.j.
inc.
rule
of
continuity
plus
relationship,
that's
an
extremely
difficult
thing
for
anybody
to
follow,
and
certainly
difficult
for
a--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--the...
it
is
a
metaphysical
question,
i
grant
you,
but
the
way
the
congress
has
defined
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
and
the
way
this
court
has
interpreted
it,
it
can
only
be
decided
whether
or
not
it
existed
in
the
past,
and
what
the
framework
of
your
question
is,
that
somehow
we
need
to
be
able
to
identify
it
in
prospect,
and
it
can't
be
done,
and
that's
the
point.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
well,
i
would
not
concede
that,
because
in
havens
realty
this
court
has
indicated
that
where
we
have
a
continuing
tort
the
proper
rule
of
accrual
can
be
from
the
last
predicate
act.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
in--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all
i
think
the
normal
rule
of
accrual,
at
least
in
present
day
law,
is
a
discovery
rule,
discovery
of
the
elements,
or
certainly
discovery
of
the
injury,
and
that
rule
is
modified
to
require--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
that
may
be,
and...
i
guess
i've
forgotten
what
the
original
question
was,
if
you
could
restate
it,
please.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
all
right,
and
if
i
may
get
to
that,
i
think
what
this
court
has
said,
for
example,
in
havens
realty
is,
if
we
have
a
continuing
violation
the
concerns
that
we
typically
have
for
a
statute
of
limitations
such
as
repose
and
staleness,
they
fade
away.
what
we
have
here
is
a
congressional
objective
as
stated
by
this
court
in
turkette,
russello,
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
which
recognizes
that
long-term
pattern
felonious
conduct
is
a
bane
on
our
economy.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
applying...
adopting
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--as
i
understand
it,
the
antitrust
rule
is...
runs
from
the
date
of
injury.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
because
the
rule
of
accrual
is
different
than
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
i
think
that
the
rule
of
accrual
that
the
court
selects
must
take
account
of
the
elements,
and
one
of
the
unique
elements
of
rico
is
pattern,
and
that's
not...
that
doesn't
exist
in
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
yes,
we
would.
we
are...
we
claim
that
under
whatever
rule
this
court
selects
we
think
we're
within
it,
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
klehrs
were
not
able
to
identify
the
source
of
their
injury,
and
they
did
everything
within
their
power.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
that's
correct.
they
did
not
connect
the
pattern
with
the
source
of
the
injury.
but
there
is
a
larger
question
here
should
the
court
choose
to
address
it,
and
that
is,
why
should
this
court
or
congress
be
interested
at
all
in
granting
repose
to
a
criminal
enterprise
that's
engaged
in
a
long-term
continuous
pattern
of
felonious
activity?
mr.
charles
a.
bird
and
that
is
true,
but
if...
if...
let's
assume
that
the
rico
plaintiff
is
able
to
establish
that
and
meets
the
pattern
element,
which
is
a
strict
element
that
this
court
has
imposed
under
the
h.j.
case,
two
acts
are
not
necessarily
enough.
we
need
continuity
plus
relationship,
and
if
we
assume,
for
example,
a
30-year
pattern
and
somebody
suing
on
the
act
that
takes
place
in
the
first
year
and
he
can
pass
that
hurdle
of
identifying
a
pattern,
which
under
most
circuits
needs
to
be
pled,
then
what's
happened
is
we
have
a
30-year
pattern
of
criminal
felonious
conduct
that
nobody's
stepped
up
to
the
plate
to
stop,
and
i
think
in--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--and--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
of
course,
the
definition--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--what
i...
of
course,
i
tried
to
address
that,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
once
we
are
able
to
identify
the
pattern,
that
is...
and
understand
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
being
able
to
identify
a
pattern
is
only
a
matter
of
perception,
and
that
means
that
we
have
a
judge
or
an
attorney
or
a
rico
plaintiff
saying,
i'm
looking
back
in
time,
and
what
is...
what
can
i
perceive
from
what's
gone
on
in
the
past,
and
that
implies,
of
course,
discovery.
you're
in
possession
of
facts
from
which
you
should
conclude--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
i
disagree
with
that.
i
disagree
with
that,
and
i
certainly
think
a
fact
question
exists,
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
silo
may
not
have
met
their
economic
expectations
does
not
necessarily
cause
them
to
question
the
underlying
concept
that...
of
oxygen
limiting,
which
was
the
basis
for
the
sale
here.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
no.
i--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--no.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i
agree
with
your
hypothetical
that
that
wouldn't
extend
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
here
it's
within
his
power
to
make
that
investigation
and
to
find
out.
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
and
this
is...
we
have
a
whole
new
way
of
attacking
a
problem,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
we
can't
get
by
with
using
what's
termed
the
traditional
rules.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
well,
i
think
part
of
our
position...
that
is
part
of
our
position,
but
understand,
the
rule
we're
advocating,
which
is
the
criminal
last
predicate
act--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--that
is
true,
as...
and
that--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--yes.
your
answer
to
that...
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
the
rico
plaintiff
under
our
analysis
is
put
into
a,
sort
of
a
classic
catch
22,
because
all
of
the
circuits
are
requiring
significant
pleading
not
only
in
terms
of
pattern
but
also
identification
of
the
underlying
acts,
and
if
you
don't
plead
enough
you're
going
to
be
out
under
rule
9,
and
if
you
wait
long
enough
so
that
you've
got
all
the
knowledge
and
crystallization
that
you
need
to
be
in
order
to
satisfy
this,
the
motivation
of
the
defendant,
rico
defendant
is
going
to
be
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
we've
been
doing
this
for
50
years.
all
of
the
elements
existed
a
long
time
ago,
and
here's
all
the
proof
of
it.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
that's
true.
it
would
not
help
if
the
injury
were
in
the
statutory
period,
but
the
problem,
or
the
catch
22
may
get
him
beyond
that
time
before
he
can
understand
that...
and
plead
and
prove
the
pattern
element.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
let's
assume...
your
hypothetical
necessarily
assumes
that
since
1940
the
rico
enterprise
has
been
engaged
in--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--right,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
yes.
the
answer
is
that
the
statute
runs
from
the
time
of
the
last
predicate
act,
and
the--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
it's
4
years.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
right,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
congressional
intent,
as
stated
in
the
preamble
and
also
is
recognized
by
this
court,
is
in
part
under
turkette
to
divest
the
enterprise
of
all
its
ill-gotten
gains.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
yes,
and
i
think
it's
the
congressional
policies
and
objectives
that
are
contained
in
the
structure
of
the
statute
itself,
as
well
as
the
policies
underlying
the
law.
and
if...
the
structure
of
the
statute
shows
no
concern
for
the
twin
issues
of
repose
and
staleness
and,
indeed,
a
rico
plaintiff
is
required
to
prove
past
injuries
well...
that
are
well
in
the
past,
and
a
rico
defendant
is
required
to
defend
those,
not
only
the
injuries
but
the
predicate
acts
themselves.
what
would
be
the
policy
justification
for
not
allowing...
for
allowing
a
rico
defendant
to
get
out
of
divesting
themselves
of
the
older
ill-gotten
gains?
any
other
rule
would
permit
the
rico
defendant
to
want
to
continue,
because
as
long
as
he--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--i
understand
that.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
you
have.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
yes,
it
does.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
what...
the
policy
advanced
there
is
that
if
you
adopt
a
rule
of
accrual,
once
the
defendant
makes
up
his
own
mind
that
i'm
going
to
stop
this
criminal
activity
he
knows
that
4
years
later
his
liability's
over.
if
he's
foolish
enough
in
year
5--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--then
if
he's
foolish
enough
to
do
what
you
just
said,
which
i
think
is
a
little
bit
unlikely,
but
let's
assume
that
it
takes
place,
why
shouldn't
we
get
him
for
it?
why
should
he
be
able
to
get
away
with
it?
mr.
charles
a.
bird
well,
i
differ
with
that.
i
think
that
again
in
havens
realty
the
court
just...
did
just--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
okay.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
under
the
last
predicate
act
rule
we
would
still
be
timely,
and
i
think
that
that's...
there
are
a
myriad
of
reasons
why
a
person
who
suffers
some
type
of
injury
might
not
sue
at
the
beginning.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
no.
that--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--that's
a
new
predicate
act,
but--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
i
think
he
is
getting
more
money
from
the
overall
marketing
scheme
and
strategy.
there
is
money
being
generated
not
only
by
the
dealer
franchise
fees
but
also
by
way
of
sales
of
repairs
on
the
project,
sales
of
collateral--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--and
repairs
to
the
klehrs
themselves.
there
were
repairs
within
the
statutory
period,
for
example,
to
the
silo,
that
they
were
motivated
to
continue
to
use,
operate,
and
maintain
the
silo.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
certainly.
the
dealer
charged--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--pardon
me?
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
that
says
they
made
a
profit.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
okay.
let
me
address
separate
accruals.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
of
course,
the
circuits
are
really
in
a
big
state
of
confusion
regarding
this
rule
of
accrual,
and
does
it
require
separate
and
independent
injury,
or
does
it
require
a
new
predicate
act,
does
it
require
both,
and
if
so
what
is
a
separate
and
independent
injury
and
what
is
a
new
predicate
act?
i
mean,
the...
if
we're
dealing
with
the
separate
and
independent
injury
question...
if
i
may,
a
very
short
hypothetical
of
my
own.
assume
i
own
a
nursing
home
and
i
buy
a
humidifier,
and...
the
last
2
months
of
a
6-month
period,
and
i
only
use
it
during
the
winter
and
the
spring.
it
creates
a
condition
of
molds
because
i
don't
have
the
right
filter,
and
it
spews
toxins
out
and
two
of
my
patients
die,
and...
who
would
say
that
those
were
not
separate
and
independent
injuries?
what
we
have
here
is
a
silo
that
when
it's
filled
is
filled
with
very
good
feed.
as
the
year
goes
by,
and
the
silo
starts
to
go
down,
starts
to
empty,
the
defect
is
such
that
it
begins
to
create
this
cauldron,
this
witches
brew
underneath
the
dome
which
in
the
last
months
of
operation
starts
to
injure
not
only
the
new
feed
but
also
the
different
cattle
that
eat
the
feed.
and
they
don't
all
get
the
same
disease.
they
all
get
different
types
of
diseases
every
year
and
different
types
of
conditions
and
symptoms
which
are
not
identifiable.
does
that
constitute
separate
and
independent
injury?
i
believe
it
does,
and
it
would
meet
the
test
of
and
surpass
the
test
of
glessner
v.
kenney
that
was
the
one
case
that
discussed
this,
and
bingham
v.
zault.
now,
do
we
have
a
separate
predicate
act,
and
i
think
we
do,
because
under
the
rico
predicate
acts
that
we're
talking
about,
which
is
mail
fraud,
the
mail
fraud
itself
is
any
mailing
in
furtherance
of
a
fraud,
or
any
use
of
the
interstate
wires,
and
we
certainly
have
that
in
the--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
bird
that
would
meet
the
requirements.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
no,
but
it's
still
ongoing,
and
you
have
to--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--oh,
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
well,
it's
a
new
predicate
act
that's
part
of
the
pattern.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i
believe
it
does,
if
the
concealment
itself
is
fraudulent.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i
don't--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--i
don't
think
in
all
circumstances
it
would,
but
i...
there
are
some
situations
in
which
it
would,
and
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
under
which
that
statement
was
made,
and
i
would
hate
to
have
a
rule
that
says
that
it
couldn't
be
under
any
circumstances,
and
i
agree
with
you
that
a
construct
could
be
made
such
that
it
would
not
constitute
fraudulent
concealment,
and
so...
i
don't
know
what
else
to
say
about
that.
i
would
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
it
might
not
be
fraudulent.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
that's
true,
for
the
dealer,
for
example.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i'd
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
a
minute...
oh.
just
two
brief
points.
our
case
is
not
based
on
these
misrepresentations
of
future
benefits.
you
can
look
at
our
complaint,
which
is
probably
50,
60
pages
long,
and
you
won't
find
any
of
those
allegations
in
there.
our
case
is
based
upon
the
fraud
relating
to
the
oxygen-limiting
nature
of
the
silo.
secondly,
given
the
variables
of
farming,
there
is
no
way,
and
we
have
the
expert
affidavit
in
our
proof
from
dr.
olson.
it's
on...
if
you
would
care
to
look
at
pages
168
through
170
of
the
joint
appendix,
it's
fully
explained
in
there.
