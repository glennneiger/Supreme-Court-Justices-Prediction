sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
see
it
that
way
myself.
the
normal
default
rule
for
when
a
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
is
that
it
runs
from
when
the
cause
of
action
accrues,
when
it
exists,
right?
that's
the
normal
rule.
once
all
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
exists,
then
the
statute
of
limitations
period
begins
to
run.
that's
the
normal
rule,
right?
will
you
concede
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
could
be,
but
the
normal
rule
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
will
begin
to
run
as
of
the
time
the
cause
of
action
comes
into
existence,
and
under
rico,
it
doesn't
come
into
existence
until
all
the
elements
are
present,
injury,
predicate
acts,
and
pattern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
of
that
moment,
then,
it
could
start
to
run,
the
statute
of
limitations,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
some
courts
have
applied
such
a
rule.
i
would
not
say
that
that
is
the
normal
rule
for
accrual
of
causes
of
action
and
running
of
statute
of
limitation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
applied
to
your
case
i
don't
see
why
the
statute
wouldn't
begin
to
run
once
you
can
say
all
the
elements
of
the
rico
cause
of
action
are
in
existence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
statute
is
patterned
after
the
antitrust
law,
the
sherman
act,
and
that
also
can
involve
a
continuing
stream
of
conduct
by
the
violator,
and
what
rule
have
we
applied
there
for
statute
of
limitations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
rule
have
we
applied
there,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
so...
and
if
this
action,
rico
is
patterned
after
that,
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
ennis,
you
have
to
have
a
cause
of
action
in
existence,
don't
you,
under
rico?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
has
to
be
a
pattern,
and
the
predicate
acts,
and
the
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we're
not
talking
about
anything
that
starts
before
those
things
are
present.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
now
what
if
it
involves
fraud.
do
we
apply
the
reasonably-should-have-discovered-the-fraud
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
we
do
about
the
situation
of
additional
mailing
later
on?
is
there
a
new
cause
of
action,
possibly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ennis--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
don't
ask
for
the
more
strict
rule
of
just,
once
the
cause
of
action
exists,
that's
it.
you
start
the
statute
running.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
