stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it...
is
it
your
view,
then,
the
statute
would
run
forever,
there's
no
statute,
or
is
it
13
years,
or
what
is
it?
i
mean,
you
say
the
last
act.
well,
all
right,
there's
an
act...
separate
out
the
problem
of
discovery,
which
i
think
is
the
same
for
any
fraud,
so
imagine
everybody
knows
everything.
now,
i'm
hurt
yesterday.
all
right,
now
do
i
go
back
for
1,000
years?
i
mean,
this
was
the
last
act.
it
turns
out
that
every
5
years
they
committed
one
act
since
1940.
do
i
go
back
to
1940?
is
that
your
idea?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
one
act
every
5
years.
that's
what
they
do.
it's
a
bank,
and
what
they've
done
is
they've
told
one
lie
or
one
fraud
in
a
loan
application
every
5
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
the
same
person,
and
he's
done
it
year
after
year,
so
what
do
we
do
under
your
theory?
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
whether
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
in
effect,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--whether
it's...
there's
none,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
why
is
it
the
case
that
in
rico
there
should
be
effectively
no
statute
of
limitations,
but
with
price-fixing
there
is
a
statute
of
limitation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
in
price-fixing
we
don't
like
that
particularly.
i
mean,
i
take
it
this
court,
when
it
decided
to
adopt
the
clayton
act
as
the
model,
looked
at
the
congressional
intent
and
thought
that
the
congressional
intent
is
best
served
by
copying
the
clayton
act.
now,
is
there
something
you
could
point
to
specifically
that
would
say
in
this
aspect
we
shouldn't
copy
the
clayton
act,
though
in
others
we
should?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
does
it
work,
for
example,
in
price-fixing?
i
go
out
and
i
buy
a
toothbrush,
and
the
toothbrush
cost
$2.
all
right,
i'm
injured.
it
should
have
cost
$1.
but
i
don't
know
anything
about...
and
i
know
the
source.
the
source
is
the
toothbrush
company,
all
right.
now,
how...
i
have
no...
i
don't
investigate
that
kind
of
thing.
nobody
does.
and
if
you
get
a
letter
from
your
bank
which
says,
we're
very
sorry,
but
your
account
is
overch...
you
know,
i
mean,
you
don't
investigate
most
frauds.
all
you
know
is
you're
paying
more
money,
or
you're...
so
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
there's
a
thing
called
fraudulent
concealment
which
operates
in
order
to
prevent
the
very
problem
that
i'm
focusing
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
if
i'm
thinking
conceptually,
is
this
right,
in
cases
like
price-fixing
or
fraud,
it
starts
to
run
from
the
moment
that
you
discovery
your
injury,
i.e.,
you
wrote
a
bigger
check.
some
courts
say
you
also
have
to
know
the
source.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
isn't
hard
to
know.
but
then,
if
there
is
fraudulent
concealment,
as
there
often
would
be
in
price-fixing
or
fraud,
that
tolls
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
thought
you
said
you
could
recover
for
the
10
more
cows,
assuming
that
it's
a
new
misrepresentation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
yes,
you
can
recover
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
with
the
bank,
you
can...
with
the
bank--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
the
bank
keeps
doing
it,
you
recover
you
just
go
back
4
years
at
a
time.
