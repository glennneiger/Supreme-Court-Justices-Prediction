justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
may
i
ask
you
question
kind
of
going
back
to
the
beginning
for
a
minute?
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
view
is...
it's
perhaps
a
substantive
question
rather
than
a
tolling
question,
but
assume
that
they
sold
three
silos,
each
of
which
was
defective
and
they
knew
they
were
defective
within
the
5-year
period,
and
the
first
purchaser
is
the
first
predicate
act
altogether,
does
he
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
what's
your
view
of
the
substantive
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
your
view
would
permit
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
run
before
the
statute
was
violated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
mean
that
if
you
had
a
victim
of
the
first
predicate
act
and
then
three
more
predicate
acts
that
occur
over
a
5
or
6-year
period,
the
statute,
the
cause
of
action
would
accrue
at
the
end
of
the
6
years.
