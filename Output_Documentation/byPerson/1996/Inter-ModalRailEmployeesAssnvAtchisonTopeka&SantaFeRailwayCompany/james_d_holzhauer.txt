mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
claim
that
santa
fe
violated
section
510
of
erisa
by
contracting
out
work
in
order
to
reduce
benefit
costs,
exactly
as
justice
stevens
presented
in
his
hypothetical.
assuming
for
now
that
those
allegations
were
correct,
they
do
not
state
a
claim
under
section
510
of
erisa.
section
510
should
not
be
interpreted
to
require
employers
to
ignore
a
very
real
element
of
labor
costs
when
they
make
fundamental
business
decisions
about
the
scope
and
nature
of
their
operation
and
whether
they're
going
to
do
work
in-house
or
subcontract
work,
whether
they're
going
to
have
something
done
at
all,
or
decide
to
close
a
particular
operation.
the
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
correct.
the
employer
here,
an
employer
can
determine
that
its
obligation
to
continue
its
benefit
costs,
no
matter
where
they're
from,
are
too
expensive,
and
we
found
out
that
we
can
subcontract
the
work
and
reduce
those
costs.
that
does
not
violate
section
510.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
the
attainment
language,
interfering
with
the
attainment
of
any
right
to
which
a
participant
may
become
entitled
talks
about
becoming
eligible,
or
in
our
view
refers
to
becoming
eligible,
arriving
at,
or
attaining
a
ripe
old
age
is
the
way
black's
defined
it,
citing
some
old
cases,
reaching
or
becoming
eligible
for
a
benefit.
and
in
section
510,
like
elsewhere
in
erisa,
attain
and
attainment
are
used
regularly
to
talk
about
attaining
a
particular
age,
attaining
years
of
service,
attaining
a
qualification
that's
necessary
to
become
eligible
for
a
benefit.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
think
that's
generally
correct,
although
i
would
say
this.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
tooth
extraction
case
might
come
under
the
exercising
part
of
section
510,
but
in
the
third
circuit
case,
the
gavelette
case,
the
court
determined
that
the
employer
decided
that
a
large
group
of
employees
at
one
plant
were
about
to
become
vested
at
one
point,
or
were
subject
to
vesting
and
were
about
to
reach
the
vesting
point,
which
is
possible,
considering
that
vesting
is
over
time.
it
might
be
a
plant
that
was
just
opened
5
years
ago.
under
those
circumstances
i
think
an
argument,
a
strong
argument
can
be
made
that
section
510
has
been
violated
even
though
the
decision
is
not
on
an
individual
basis.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
i
think
that
could
quite
likely
be
a
violation
of
the
exercising
clause
of
section
510.
the
attainment
clause
talks
about
attaining
rights
to
which
the
participant
may
become
entitled,
and
i
think
that's
another
future-oriented
kind
of
reference
in
that
provision.
clearly,
it
would
violate
section
510
to
fire
someone
because
they
filed
a
claim,
an
expensive
claim
relating
to
having
their
wisdom
teeth
extracted.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
sure.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that
would
be
correct.
i
think
vesting,
the
maximum
period
for
vesting
now
is
10
years
in
a
multiemployer,
between
5
and
8
in
other
plans,
but
if
it
was
on
the
cliff
for
vesting,
and
you
said
everybody
in
that
plant...
this
plant
was
just
opened
5
years
ago,
and
everybody
in
that
plant
is
about
to
vest,
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
close
that
plant
and
maybe
open
it
up
again
next
week
or
subcontract
out
the
work
or
whatever,
i
think
that
would
be
a
section
510
violation.
now,
justice
kennedy,
in
your
question,
the
person
that
had
the
tooth
extracted
clearly
would
violate
section
510,
the
exercising
clause,
to
fire
him
because
he
filed
a
claim.
i
think
a
strong
argument
can
be
made
that
if
the
employer
sees
him
coming
down
the
hall
with
his
claim
form
and
a
stack
of
medical
bills
with
it,
it
might
violate
510
then
as
well,
and
it
might
violate
510,
the
exercising
clause,
if
the
employee...
employer
knew
that
that
employee
has
a
particular
illness
or
particular
condition
that
is
going
to
require,
or
has
already
required
large
expenditures
or
benefits.
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
what
we
have
here
is
something
very
close,
as
counsel
for
petitioners
acknowledge,
to
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
an
employer
who
decides
that
benefit
costs
are
too
high.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
it's
not
like
a
lot
of--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
reason
why
i
think
the
gavelette
kind
of
situation,
where
people
are
about
to
vest,
is
different
is
because
it
focuses
on
the
fact
that
a
large
number
of
people
are
about
to
attain
eligibility
for
a
benefit.
it's
not
that
they're--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--there
is--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--there
is
an
exercising
clause
here,
and
perhaps
one
could
make
an
argument
that
if
a
particular
group
of
employees
were
exercising
their
benefits
in
a
way
that
were
different
from
other
groups,
or
so
forth.
but
here
what
you
have
is
a
group
that
said,
benefits
are
just
too
expensive.
i'm
not
going
to
pay
those
benefits,
or
i'm
not
going
to
pay
that
rich
a
benefit
program.
i'm
going
to
subcontract
out
work
because
subcontracting
out
work
is
going
to
reduce
my
benefit
costs.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
no.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
no,
he
hasn't.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
attainment
of
a
right
to
which
an
employee
or
a
participant
may
become
entitled
to,
that
language,
and
using
that
language,
and
considering
that
language
in
light
of
the
particular
context
congress
was
concerned
with,
refers
to
becoming
eligible
for
a
benefit.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--well,
first
of
all
i
think
that
flip
from
attaining
or
obtaining
is
very
interesting,
because
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
differences
between
the
kind
of
language
we're
using
here.
congress
was
concerned
about
a
particular
circumstance,
and
we
know
that
the
language
might
not
be
limited
to
that
circumstance,
but
becoming
eligible
for
pension
benefits,
and
vesting
on
pension
benefits.
whether
the
exercise
clause
might
help
that
employee,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
it
applies--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--sure.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
it
applies
in
welfare
situations.
there's
a
very
strong
reason
why
it
wouldn't
apply
in
your
kind
of
situation,
i
think
the
same
reason
why
it
wouldn't
apply
in
the
situation
that's
before
the
court.
employers
are
not
prohibited
by
erisa,
should
not
be
prohibited
by
erisa
from
making
legitimate,
cost-based
economic
decisions,
and
that's
reflected
in
erisa
itself,
the
debates
over
erisa,
and
the
court's
decisions
over
erisa.
erisa
involved
a
balancing
of
interests,
particularly
in
the
welfare--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--sure.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--well,
of
course,
there's
nothing
in
section
510
that
talks
about
employers
being
required
to
amend
or
terminate
plans,
but
in
many
situations
that's
not
going
to
be
practically
possible.
we
might
have
a
situation,
for
example,
where
an
employer's
obligations
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
require
the
employer
to
pay
benefits
and
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
unilaterally
amend
or
terminate
their
plan,
but
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
might
also
provide
that
the
employer
is
entitled
to
subcontract
work,
or
the
national
labor
relations
act
might
give
them
a
right
to
subcontract
work.
same
thing
happens
with
wages.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
sure.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
sure.
well,
in
some
circumstances
the
employer
might
also
take
this
position
with
regard
to
wages.
the
union
contract
sets
a
certain
wage
but
allows
the
employer
to
subcontract.
the
employers...
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
sets
certain
benefits,
but
the
employer
is
allowed
to
subcontract,
or
the
national
labor
relations
act
gives
a
procedure
or
mechanism
for
subcontracting
out
work.
there
are
other
circumstances
where
it
makes
no
sense
to
amend
or
terminate
a
plan.
often
insurance
contracts,
if
it's
an
insured
plan,
will
provide
that
we
want
to
cover
all
your
employees.
we
don't
want
you
to
carve
out
little
groups
of
employees
because
we're
afraid
you
might
do
it
in
a
way
that's
to
our
disadvantage,
or
we
just
want
the
big
business
or
no
business
at
all.
under
those
circumstances
the
employer
may
not
be
able
to
amend
or
terminate.
it
also
might
not
solve
the
situation
at
all
in
a
variety
of
circumstances.
suppose
an
employer
had
two
different
plants,
and
it
had
to
decide
which
one
to
close.
they
both
had
health
insurance
benefits,
but
one
was
very
costly,
and
one
was
less
costly,
perhaps
because
of
the
region
of
the
country
they
were
in.
under
those
circumstances
that
would
be
a
violation
of
section
510
to
make
that
decision
based
on
benefit
costs
if
you
followed
the
petitioner's
argument,
but
it
would
be
just
a
legitimate
economic
decision
based
on
what's
more
expensive
for
the
employer.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
of
erisa,
and
there's
certainly
no
requirement,
even
if
we
can
flip
from
obtain
to
attain
and
argue
that
that
clause
can
be
read
much
more
broadly
than
it
is,
there's
certainly
no
requirement
in
section
510,
no
language
that
would
dictate
that
we
reach
a
result
that
would
require
employers
to
ignore
very
real
economic
costs
that
they
face,
and
costs
that
employers
base
very
similar
decisions
on
every
day.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
it
would
apply
to
pension
benefits
generally
in
the
sense
that,
suppose
we
had
a
workforce
that
had
vested
pensions,
or
not
vested
pensions,
but
were
just
accruing
pension
benefits
rateably
over
time.
there
was
no
circumstance
where
we
were
focusing
on
people
who
were
about
to
vest,
but
we
just
decided
that
the
benefit
costs
of
that
plan
are
too
expensive,
and
the
benefit
costs
that
we
were
concerned
about
in
that
plan
were
pension
benefits.
under
those
circumstances
i
still
say
that
that
would
not
violate
section
510.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
no.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
the
ninth
circuit
held...
again,
the
ninth
circuit's
treatment
of
both
of
these
issues
was
rather
cursory,
so
it's
really
hard
to
understand
exactly
what
their
reasoning
was,
but
quoting
ingersoll-rand,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
510
protects
plan
participants
from
termination
motivated
by
an
employer's
desire
to
prevent
a
pension
from
vesting.
santa
fe
saw
no
need
to
cross-petition
on
that
issue,
because
it's
quite
confident
that
when
it
goes
back
on
remand
it's
going
to
be
able
to
show
that
it
didn't
take
any
action
to
prevent
pensions
from
vesting.
we
thought
that
that's
what
the
court
talked
about
as
the
pension
part
of
510,
on
remand
we'll
be
fine.
if
they're
using
the
term
more
broadly
than
they
say
they
were
using
it,
the
same
argument
would
apply.
now,
section
510
was
adopted
as
a
corollary
to
erisa's
vesting
requirement,
which
was
essential
to
the
statutory
scheme
put
in
place
by
congress,
and
for
the
first
time
congress
required
that
pension
benefits
become
nonforfeitable
after
a
set
period
of
time.
congress
recognized
that
employers
might
circumvent
that
vesting
requirement
by
discharging
employees
who
were
about
to
become
vested,
and
they
installed
section
510
to
deal
with
that
problem.
it
makes
perfect
sense
in
that
context
to
say
it
protects
you,
the
attainment
clause
of
section
510
protects
you
until
you
become
eligible
for
the
benefits,
but
doesn't
provide
you
with
meaningful
protection
thereafter,
although
the
exercising
clause
might.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
if
the
employee
is
already
eligible
for
those
benefits,
and--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--right.
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right.
uh-huh.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
think
under
those
circumstances
the
employer
would
already
be
eligible
for
those
benefits.
if
there
was
a
violation--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--no--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--i
think
the
attainment
clause
talks
about
whether
the
employer...
the
employee
will
become
eligible
for
health
insurance,
will
become
eligible
for
dental
insurance,
will
become
eligible
for
a
pension,
or
a
vested
pension.
under
the
way
i
interpret
section
5--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--sure.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes.
the
exercising
clause
could
be
violated
by
that.
the
attainment
clause,
no.
i
don't
believe
that
would
involve
the
attainment
clause,
because
that
would
not
involve
becoming
eligible
for
benefit.
i
also
disagree
with--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--well,
i
think
that
a
strong
argument
can
be
made,
and
it's
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
but
a
strong
argument
can
be
made
certainly
that...
well,
clearly
it
would
violate
section
510
to
fire
that
employee
just
after
they
file
that
claim,
because
they
filed
that
expensive
claim.
can
an
employer
circumvent
the
exercising
clause
by
doing
it
just
before
they
file
the
claim?
i
think
one
can
make
a
strong
argument
that
it
would.
i
also
strongly
disagree
with
the
government's
representation
that
that
hypothetical
is
in
any
sense
real.
the
reality
of
that
hypothetical
ignores
cobra
benefits.
an
employer,
once
an
employee
is
terminated,
the
employee
generally
is
entitled
to
cobra
benefits
which
will
keep
insurance
in
place--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--often...
more
often
they
get
exactly
what
the
plan
gives.
the
most
common
cobra
benefits
is
exactly
the
health
insurance
that
they
get.
they
don't
get
the
other
kinds
of
benefits,
but
they
would
get
the
health
insurance.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
justice
scalia,
earlier
you
asked
whether
it
was
ever...
whether
it
was
common
to
have
plans
that
allow
you
to
get
health
insurance
after
being
there
for
a
year,
or
after
passing
a
probationary
period,
which
might
be
90
days.
it's
very
common.
that's
common
throughout
industry,
and
that
could
very
well
be
the
kind
of
situation.
an
employee
often
has
to
work
a
certain
period
of
time
in
the
sense
of
hours
per
week,
or
hours
over
an
accumulated
period
of
time,
in
order
to
become
a
full-time
employee
for
benefits
purposes.
it
could
violate
section
510's
attainment
clause
to
stop
somebody
from
working
over
that
threshold.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
think--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--i
think
congress
was
concerned
about
vesting
pension
benefits,
but
congress
talked
about
employee
benefit
plans,
and
i
think
there
could
be
analogous
circumstances
under
which
section
510's
attainment
clause
would
apply
to
welfare
benefits
as
well,
and
that's
one
very
analogous
circumstance.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
i
was
talking
about
circumventing
the
exercise
clause.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
i
think
the
exercising
clause
was
intended
to
deal
with
a
kind
of
individual...
not
global
plant
closing
or
plan
design
situation,
but
an
individual
situation
where
you
were
focusing
and
targeting
a
particular
individual
and
saying,
that
person's
going
to
be
too
expensive.
i
am
going
to
terminate
that
person
because
their
benefits
are
too
high.
clearly,
it
does
violate
the
exercising
clause
by
any
reading
to
do
that
after
the
employee
has
started
filing
those
benefits...
oh,
he's
exercised
his
right
to
benefits
too
much,
i'm
going
to
fire
him
as
a
consequence
of
doing
that.
the
question
is
whether,
in
the
very
same
circumstances,
where
you're
looking
at
an
individual
employee
who's
about
to
file
a
lot
of
claims
because
he
has
bad
wisdom
teeth,
or
he
has
other
problems,
whether
that
would
violate
the
exercising
clause
in
section
510,
and
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
it
would.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
the
specific
employee,
rather
than
a
global,
cost-based
organizational
change.
what
has
been
going
on
in
this
case
was
a
fundamental
change
in
the
way
santa
fe
operated
its
business.
it
was
no
longer
going
to
be
using
its
own
employees
to
do
that
work.
it
was
subcontracting
that
work
out
to
other
employees.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--i
think
that
there
certainly...
there
are
circumstances...
generally
speaking,
pension
benefits
are
required
under
the
statute
to
accrue
rateably
over
time,
not
to
have
these
kinds
of
cliffs
in
which
you're
entitled
under
the
plan
to
additional
money.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes.
there
are
circumstances...
for
example,
i
think
the
heath
case
was
one
of
those,
in
the
seventh
circuit,
where
an
employee
was
entitled
to
early
retirement,
additional
benefits
if
they
reached
a
certain
age,
and
i
think
that
he
would
become
eligible
for
those
benefits
if
they
stayed
on
the
workforce.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
that's
an
attainment
matter.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
right.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
no,
no.
we're
not
talking
about
getting
that
amount
of
money.
we're
talking
about
becoming
eligible
for
a
new
benefit.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
an
employee
who
was
not
entitled
to
an
early
retirement
benefit.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
overall
statute
was
to
deal
with
the
vesting
circumstance,
and
then
to
prevent
people
from
circumventing
someone
from
vesting,
and
i
think
when
there
are
analogous
circumstances
like
someone
about
to
become
eligible
for
early
retirement
benefits,
under
those
circumstances
that
would
be
a
similar
eligibility
threshold,
and
crossing
that
eligibility
threshold
would
be
involved,
but
nothing
like
that
is
going
on
here.
this
is
a
global
prospects
change.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
i
found
that
decision
puzzling,
because
the
court
said
on
the
one
hand
these
employees
weren't
discharged
and
we
didn't...
congress
didn't
use
the
words
layoff
and
termination
in
that
case,
but
then
it
said
that
well,
there
might
be
some
circumstances
where
a
particular
attribute
of
that
workforce
might
call
it
into
play.
i
assume
they
were
referring
to
the
gavelette
case,
or
that
kind
of
hypothetical
in
their
situation,
where
it
would
apply.
well,
if
it's
not
a
termination
to
subcontract
out
work
under
these
circumstances,
how
would
it
be
a
termination
or
a
discharge
under
those
second
set
of
circumstances?
i
think
the
d.c.
circuit
was
struggling
with
what
several
other
courts
have
struggled
with
as
how
to
fit
section
510,
how
to
square
section
510
with
these
kinds
of
fundamental
business
changes,
cost-based
changes
that
employers
ordinarily
do,
and
this
is
very
much
like
the
kind
of
change
that
peter
drucker
talked
about
in
his
wall
street
journal
article
some
years,
sell
the
mailroom.
these
kinds
of
changes
are
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
erisa
was
intended
to
encompass.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes,
it
would
have.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
yes.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
they
claim
that
they
suffered
welfare...
they
claim
that
they
were...
that
santa
fe
took
this
action
in
order
to
reduce
a
wide
spectrum
of
benefits,
salary,
vacation,
sick
leave
benefits,
things
that
are
not
erisa-included.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
they...
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
don't
think
the
pleading
covers
individuals.
it
talks
about
terminating
welfare
and
pension--
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
--right.
what
they
were
talking
about
is
the
fact
that
under
the
new
its
teamsters
contract
there
was
a
reduction
in
contributions.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
and
a
commensurate
reduction
in
benefits,
but
it
was
not
something
that
interfered
with
their
attainment
of
eligibility
for
a
particular
category
of
benefits.
mr.
james
d.
holzhauer
well,
it
could
be,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
entire
complaint,
you
look
at
what
petitioners
have
said
in
their
briefs
and
in
this
argument,
it's
clear
that
basically
what
this
case
comes
down
to
is
the
hypothetical
you
raised
early
on
in
the
argument.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
