stephen
g.

suppose
joe
jones
is
a
person
who,
the
employer
looks
one
day
and
says,
i'm
afraid
that
fellow
is
going
to
get
wisdom
teeth
pulled
out,
and
before
he
even
thinks
about
it,
i'm
going
to
cancel
this
benefit
in
his
plan,
which
is
there,
before
he
gets
the
wisdom
tooth
problem.
hasn't
the
employer
fired
him,
or
cancelled
the
benefit,
or
sent
him
somewhere
else,
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
attaining
a
right
that
he
otherwise
would
have
under
the
plan?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
reason...
assuming
you
could
read
it
either
way,
and...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it's
contrary
to
english
to
say,
i
have
a
right
to
$2,000
of
dental
expenses
if
i
get
wisdom
teeth
pulled
out,
and
my
employer,
before
i
have
any
toothache,
says
i'm
going
to
fire
him.
i
don't
want
him
to
get
that.
i
think
in
english
you
could
say
he's
fired
me
to
prevent
me
from
obtaining...
or
attaining...
obtaining...
you
can
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
mean,
it's
more
natural
to
say
obtaining
a
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
can
say
attaining
a
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
english,
not
bad
english.
so
if
i
think
it's
fairly
good
english,
or
reasonable
english,
is
there
any
reason
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
protect
me
in
such
a
situation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i
mean,
why
wouldn't,
as
long
as...
you
know,
i
mean,
these
things
are
written
in
congress.
the
lawyers
all
look
at
them,
and
so
they
might
have
talked
a
lot
about
pensions,
but
they
would
have
thought,
it
applies
to
welfare,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
unless
there's
some
reason
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it
applies
in
my
situation,
the
toothache
situation.
now,
unless
there's
some
reason
why
it
wouldn't,
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
what
they've
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
just
would
like
your
response
on
that
point,
is
sure,
you
have
a
point.
it
was
made
to
congress,
and
so
congress
passes
a
statute
to
say
you're
worried
about
money?
cancel
the
plan.
go
through
steps
a,
b,
and
c.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
reduce
the
benefits.
but
what
we
don't
want
you
to
do
is
this
other
way
of
trying
to
achieve
a
similar
result,
firing
everybody,
rehiring
them.
that's
a
burden
for
you.
you
have
some
burdens
and
you
have
some
benefits.
it's
a
compromise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
want
to
have
this
right,
you
work
it
out
with
the
union.
i
mean,
that's
normal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
bring
it
up
on
the
table.
say
what
we
can
do.
amend
the
plan.
why...
why
is
it
a
problem
for
the
employer?
i
mean,
i
understand
what
they'd
like--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
clause
is
it
that
covers
if
my
pension
benefit's
vested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
entitled
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
by
the
way,
if
i
worked
2
more
years
and
have
a
promotion,
it
doubles
in
amount,
so
they
fire
me
so
i
don't
get
the
doubling
in
amount.
now,
which
part
of
the...
is
that
the
fail
to
exercise
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
failure
to
attain
a
benefit,
or
do
you
think
they
could
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you're
saying
the
court
did
say
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
an
attainment
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore
the
normal
thing
in
getting
an
amount
of
money
when
a
certain
event
happens
under
a
plan
that
has
vested,
at
least
in
the
pension
area,
seems
to
be
to
call
it
an
attainment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
follow
the
same
reasoning
here,
you're
going
to
say
getting
that
amount
of
money
under
a
plan
that
has
vested
when
the
toothache
occurs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
did
you
have
something
you
wanted
to
say
about
purpose,
because
the
only
reason
i
ask
that
is
that
seems
to
have
come
up,
and
i'm
not
certain
we
should
reach
it
here,
but
i
know
it's
been
argued.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
maybe
you'd
be
better
to
do
it
with
facts,
or
with
amici,
or
whatever,
but
if
you
did
make
a
point
about
it--
