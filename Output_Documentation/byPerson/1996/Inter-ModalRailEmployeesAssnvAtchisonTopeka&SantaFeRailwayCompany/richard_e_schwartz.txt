mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
railroad
workers
who
are
the
petitioner
in
this
case
have
been
denied
their
day
in
court
by
the
dismissal
of
their
petition
in
the
district
court.
this
case
pleaded...
presented
today
pleaded
a
unique,
egregious
conspiracy
to
deprive
a
particular
group
of
employees
of
their
welfare
plan
benefits.
they
have
pleaded
specific
intent
to
commit
acts
prohibited
by
section
510
of
erisa.
they
have
pleaded
and
their
case
involves
the
use
of
deceit
leading
to
coercion
used
to
implement
this
sham
transaction.
the
conduct
pleaded
fits
squarely
within
the
congressional
intent
in
the
enactment
of
section
510.
the
railroad
workers
here
have
pleaded
a
conspiracy
to
interfere
with
the
specificity
sufficient
to
comply
even
with
rule
9
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
justice
ginsburg,
these
benefits
were
contractually
vested
as
part
of
a
nation-wide
multiemployer
bargaining
pattern
with
the
teamsters
union.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
no.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
it
would
be
possible
only
if
they
were
willing
and
able
to
go
back
and
bargain
for
a
change
in
the
contractually
agreed
benefits
and
then,
pursuant
to
that,
make
the
necessary--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--i
do
not
believe
that's
correct,
because
we're
still
dealing
with
the
element
of
the
contractual
vesting
of
the
benefits,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
attempt
to.
i--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--provided
that
there
is
appropriate
compliance
with
the
amendment
procedures,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
that's
certainly
an
element
in
our
contention,
that
they
could
not
legally
have
gone
about
doing
this
had
they
not
resorted
to
this
subterfuge.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
they
would
have
run
afoul--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--yes.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
we
need
to
make
a
proviso...
and
i
believe
that
the
government
may
talk
about
this.
there
is
some
basis,
i
believe,
for
the
opinion
that
even
plan
amendments
can't
be
made
without...
when
they're
done
for
a
specific
discriminatory
purpose.
i
am
not
prepared
to--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--as
a
general
proposition,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
here,
what
is
generally
called
a
fire
and
hire
situation.
they
wanted
to
keep
these
employees.
they're
highly
trained
and
productive.
but
they
wanted
to
keep
them
without
the
benefits,
and
therefore
they
had
to
go
through
this
elaborate--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--well,
i
think
it's
a
great
deal
more
complicated
than
that.
they
have
to
make
the
necessary
plan
amendments
and,
making
plan
amendments,
they
incur
consequences
with
their
own
workforce.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
certainly
i
do
not
think
it
is
correct
that
the
employer
here
could
have
done
it
without
modification
of
their
contract.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
justice
stevens--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--we
believe
that
the
rights
are
contractually
vested
for
the
duration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
was
a--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--yes.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
the
position
is
that
they
were
vested
for
a
limited
period
under
the
terms
of
the
cba,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
well--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--it's
important
to
understand
that
within
the
context
of
the
cba,
of
course,
we're
dealing
with
section
301.
we're
dealing
with
a
lot
of
elaborate
grievance
and
arbitration
machinery,
and
exclusive
remedies.
we're
also
dealing
here
with
a
bankrupt
teamsters
local
that
was
not
able
to
share
those
burdens.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
we
are
claiming
exclusively
under
section
510.
we
believe
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
important
in
terms
of
understanding
the
context
in
which
this
arose.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
i
believe
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
to
do
with
evaluating
the
respondent's
arguments
relating
to
targeting
their
claim
for
a
judicially
crafted
exception
to
section
510.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
our
understanding
is
that
they
no
longer
support
the
ninth
circuit's
rationale
for
the
decision
in
the
case.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
these
workers
in
large
part
were
given
a
last
minute
opportunity
to
apply
for
reemployment
with
the
substitute
employer,
respondent
internal
services.
the
teamsters
union
signed
them
to
a
contract
with
greatly
reduced
benefits.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
it
was.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
none
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
i
believe
it
has
to
do
with
the
internal
teamster
struggles
locally
in
los
angeles
and
nationally,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
the
health
insurance
coverage
was
dramatically
reduced.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
it
occurred
within
a
matter
of
a
space
of
less
than
2
weeks,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
we...
justice
o'connor,
we're
talking
about
people
who
enjoyed
for
a
period
of
at
least
1
year
longer
before
the
implementation
of
this
transaction
an
ongoing
coverage
of
entire
medical
care.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
as
far
as
we
are
aware
the
multiemployer
health
plan
which
was
administered
principally
by
the
union
management
group
continued
to
pay
properly
accrued
claims
up
until--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--the
date
of
implementation.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
in
addition,
justice
o'connor,
we're
dealing
with
a
loss
of
vacation
pay,
a
loss
of
sick
pay,
and
the
welfare--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--the
teamsters
contract
is
extremely
elusive.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
the
teamsters
contract
is
extremely
elusive,
because
they
went
from
the
nationally
bargained
teamster
contract
to
what
is
known
as
a
white
paper
contract,
which
was
a
very
short,
specifically
focused
contract--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--we
think--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--justice
o'connor,
we
think
it's
from
the
plain
language
and
the
underlying
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
erisa
that
the
second
clause
of
section
510
covers
this
situation
precisely.
the
language,
interference
with
the
attainment
of
a
right
to
which
participant
may
become
entitled--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--yes,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
imply
vesting,
and
in
this
particular
situation,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
had
a
situation
where
people
expected
that
if
their
children
had
doctor
appointments
in
april
or
may
they
would
be
covered
under
the
teamsters
plan.
if
they
needed
to
go
in
for
a
previously
scheduled
operation
in
june,
that
would
have
been
covered
prior
to
march
19,
when
the
people
were
suddenly
informed
that
they
were
going
to
have
the
opportunity
with
the
new
employer
on
april
1.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
i
hesitate
to
speak
for
mr.
holzhauer,
but
it's
our
understanding
with
their...
they
have...
i
believe
they
have
essentially
conceded
and
would
no
longer
take
the
position
that
the
welfare,
health
and
welfare
benefits
such
as
are
involved
here
are
not
covered
by
the
second
clause
of
510.
i
think
that's
apparent
throughout
their
brief.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
i...
what
we
find
is
the
more
interesting
and
perhaps
troublesome
issues
deal
more
with
their
argument
relating
to
targeting,
mr.
chief
justice.
clearly,
attainment
and
may
become
entitled
indicate
some
element
of
maturity,
certainly.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
no,
it's
not,
because
here...
it
might
be
the
case
that
if
you
were
working
at
that
hypothetical
employer
under
a
contract
that
had
another
year
and...
another
13
months
to
go,
instead
of
being
an
at-will
employee.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
i
believe
that's...
they
have,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
i
believe
that
that's
pretty
much
what
occurred
here.
the
railroad
targeted
the
one
group
in
the
entire
railyard
that
was
dealing
with...
that
was
covered
by
erisa-protected
benefits
rather
than
living
under
the...
explicitly
under
the
railroad
retirement
plans.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
i
think
it's
possible
to
draw
a
bright
line
distinction
between
legitimate
efficiencies
versus
mere
benefits...
gains
from
the
avoidance
of
benefits.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
certainly
i
believe
that
the
court
needs
to
be
extremely
careful
not
to
open
the
floodgates
to
circumvention
of
the
statute,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
i
suppose
we
would
get
into
the
shifting
burden
analysis
and
whether
the
other
reasons
given
are
protectural--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--i
hope
i--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--justice
souter,
i...
if
i
gave
that
impression
i
regret
that
i...
i
spoke
in
error.
i
believe
that--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--simply
the
identification
of
another...
one
or
more
purported
efficiencies
is
not
sufficient.
i
believe
that
the
court--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--we
would
submit
that
in
that
situation
the
focus
must
and
should
be
on
whether
or
not
the
cost-savings
reflect
substantially
more
than
the
gain--
mr.
richard
e.
schwartz
--it
is
a
pleadings
case,
and
we
believe
it
should
be
sufficient
to
give
these
railroad
workers
their
day
in
court.
