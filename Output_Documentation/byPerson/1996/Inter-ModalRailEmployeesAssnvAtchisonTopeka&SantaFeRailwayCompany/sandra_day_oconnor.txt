o'connor
now,
if
there
were
no
union
agreement
the
law
clearly
allows
the
employer
to
just
get
rid
of
these
welfare
benefits
under
the
plan.
is
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
the
problem
here
is
that
there
is
a
union
agreement
under
which
the...
under
the
terms
of
which
the
employer
must
provide
these
benefits.
is
that
the
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
could
have
legally
done
it
for
purposes
of
the
erisa
statute,
but
in
so
doing,
would
have
violated
the
union
agreement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
health
and
welfare
benefits
were
actually
reduced
as
a
result
of
the
restructuring
of
the
work
at
hobart
yard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
not
for
any
coverage
for
things
that
had
already
occurred.
we're
talking
about
future
benefit
opportunities.
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
aren't
talking
about
people
who
had
incurred
an
injury
and
wanted
medical
benefits.
we're
talking
about
people
who
might
in
the
future
incur
injuries
or
illness
and
need
medical
benefits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
had
health
insurance,
but
we're
not
talking
about
people
who
had
gotten
sick
and
incurred
medical
bills
already,
and
then
they
weren't
paid.
we're
talking
about
future
opportunity
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
are
talking
about
future
opportunities
for
health
care.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
trying
to
talk
about
section
510,
though.
we're
not
trying
to
talk
to
you
about
the
union
contract,
because
the
claim
is
made
under
section
510
of
erisa,
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
find
out
from
you,
how
to
make
it
fit
under
section
510
of
erisa.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
claim,
that
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
the
employer
might
have
a
motive
to
get
rid
of
the
employee
who
has
a
child
that
would
cost
a
lot
of
health
care
benefits
in
the
future.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
does
happen.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
ms.
pillard--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
holzhauer,
you
take
the
position
that
the
employer
may
decide
that
the
cost
of
welfare
benefits
under
the
railway
labor
workers
act
is
just
too
expensive,
and
if
we
can
get
rid
of
that
whole
requirement,
we
will
be
better
off
economically,
and
so
we'll
have
this
termination
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
that
is
not
prohibited
by
section
510.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
do
we
do
with
the
attainment...
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
the
attainment
of
any
right
language
in
510?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
it
covers
the
individual
situation,
where
the
employer
foresees
that
a
given
employee
is
going
to
be
very
costly
in
terms
of
medical
care,
either
the
employee
or
a
member
of
the
employee's
family?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
employee
is
covered
by
a
health
plan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
employee
has
a
child,
and
the
child
then
is
diagnosed
as
having
a
very
serious--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--medical
condition
that
is
going
to
cost
megabucks,
and
the
employer
says,
i
don't
want
to
have
that
effect
on
my
health
costs.
you're
out
of
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
eligible,
will
become--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--eligible
when
the
child
goes
to
the
doctor
for
surgery.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
answer
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
that
circumstance,
is
section
510
violated
if
the
employer
says,
you're
fired
because
i
don't
want
that
obligation
in
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i'm
not
sure
that
the
exercise
clause
would
kick
in
either,
because
the
child
hasn't
gone
to
the
hospital
for
the
surgery
yet.
