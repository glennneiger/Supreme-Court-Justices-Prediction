the--
justice
anthony
m.

--justice
kennedy
i
think
has
a
question
for
you.
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
at
the
outset
that
if
for
sheer
cost
standpoints,
because
welfare
benefits
were
expensive,
these
employees
were
terminated,
the
work
was
sent
elsewhere,
that
that
would
not
be
a
violation,
and
i
want
to
know
what
is
the
test
that
you
have
that
leads
you
to
give
him
that
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that,
it
seemed
to
me
justice
stevens'
case
covered
that.
sure,
that's
the
whole
purpose,
yes.
in
my
hypothetical
that
was
the
whole
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
his
hypothetical
was
the
benefits
are
expensive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
look
at
these
benefits
and
say,
we
can't
afford
these
things.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
don't
see
how
this
squares
with
your
attainment
argument.
you
began
by
saying
attain
means
that
you're
about
to
reach
something.
this
is
the
black's
law
dictionary.
but
then
you
said,
now
of
course
this
doesn't
apply
to...
you
had
a
wisdom
tooth
hypothetical,
or
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
of
a
very
expensive
particular
case.
suppose
that
that
employee
was
receiving
benefits.
he
or
she
had
attained
the
right
in
that
sense,
and
the
employer
terminates
in
order
to
avoid
the
coverage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
your
attainment
test
have
resolved
the
andes
case
in
favor
of
the
employer?
