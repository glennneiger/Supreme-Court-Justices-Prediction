justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
in
your
presentation
that
the
rights
at
stake
here
had
already
vested,
which
puzzles
me
because
you're
relying
on
a
statute
that
talks
about
being...
losing...
being
discharged
in
order
to
prevent
a
right
from
becoming
vested,
or
attainment
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
your
view?
are
the
rights
vested
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
being
vested
in
an
unusual
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
had
a
vested
right,
why
don't
you
just
sue
to
recover
that
right?
you
don't
need
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
to
recover...
to
get
compensation
for
the
destruction
of
a
vested
right.
the
statute
is
designed
to
prevent,
discharged
in
order
to
avoid
vesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
not
quite
clear
exactly
what
your
position
is
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
give
me
an
example
of
a
particular
individual
who
had
a
vested
right
and
is
not
able
to
just
sue
for
that
right
without
relying
on
the
statute.
maybe
he'd
gone
to
the
dentist
and
ran
up
a
dental
bill
or
something.
he
had
the
right
to
have
it
paid.
is
it
that
sort
of
thing
you're
saying?
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
right
in
the
future
if
he
wants
to
go
to
the
dentist
it
will
be
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
vacation
pay
that
had
already...
there
would
be
an
obligation
to
pay,
just
future
vacation
pay.
it's
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
vacation
pay
that
would
be
paid
in
the
future,
rather
than
cutting
off
some
that
had
already
been
earned,
is
that
correct?
you're
kind
of
vague
in
your
answer.
it's
helpful
to
us
if
we
get
a
categorical--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
is
your
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
hypothetical
question?
supposing
there's
no
union
agreement
or
anything
involved,
and
the
employer
finds
out
that
a
segment
of
his
workforce
performing
one
specific
task,
they...
they're
entitled
to
welfare...
health
and...
health
benefits,
and
they
find
out
that
if
they
subcontracted
all
that
work
out
to
others
they
would
save
the
cost
of
those
benefits,
and
they
decide
that's
the
reason
they
want
to
make
that
change,
and
they
do
it.
have
they
violated
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
respondent
seems
to
pretty
well
agree
with
this
much
of
your
argument.
what
do
you
do
with
my
hypothetical
case,
just
a
clean-cut
example
of
trying
to
cut
costs
among
others
by
welfare...
you
know,
by
contracting
out
to
save
the
money
there?
that's
clearly
an
economic
motive,
and
there
were
no
vested
benefits
in
the
sense
that
there
were
no
unpaid
medical
bills
based
on
injuries
that
had
already
occurred.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
none
of
that...
none
of
that.
pure
economic...
everyone
is
healthy
at
the
time
that
the
decision
is
made,
but
it's
just
a
little
cheaper
to
do
it
this
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
equally
clear...
let
me
just
be
sure
i
get
one
thing
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
if
you
took
my
hypothetical
and
said,
instead
of
health
benefits,
we're
concerned
that
90
percent
of
these
people
are
about
to
reach
20
years
of
service
and
therefore
have
vested
benefits,
and
you
took
out
the
whole
division
and
substituted
with
a
contract,
that
would
clearly
violate
it,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder,
because
in
paragraph
30
they
specifically
argue,
or
allege
that
benefits...
they
suffered
a
reduction
of
benefits
from
their
pension
plan
and
health
and
welfare
plans.
there's
that
allegation
in
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you...
i
mean,
if
that's
true,
that's
a
vested
right
that
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
covered
at
least
some
hypothetical
cases
of
individual
vestings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suffered
a
reduction
of
contributions
to
and
benefits
from
pension
plans
and
health
and
welfare
plans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
say
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
the
difference
between
you
and
the
government
on
how
you
read
that
paragraph,
i
guess.
