justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
you're
saying
in
effect
that
they
could
do
in
a...
with
a
single
employer
plan,
no
contrary
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they
could
do
in
two
steps
what
you're
saying
they
can't
do
in
one
step
here,
because
number
1,
they
could
simply
eliminate
the
benefits,
and
having
eliminated
the
benefits
they
could
then
eliminate
their
division
or
fire
all
those
employees
who
had
been
getting
the
benefits,
and
so
the
different...
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is
a
very
formalistic
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
why
is
it
a
discriminatory
purpose
simply
to
say
i
am...
you
know
that
they
can
be
eliminated,
period,
can't
they?
they're
costing
me
too
much.
there's
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
i
would
violate.
there's
no
multiemployer
plan,
so
i
have
autonomy
here,
and
i'm
simply
going
to
eliminate
them.
that
they
can
do
as
a
general
proposition.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
and
what,
then...
if
they
can
do
that,
why
does
it
then
become
discriminatory
when,
having
eliminated
those
benefits
they
say,
i
probably
would
be
better
off
to
have
an
outside
company
doing
this
work,
so
i
will
eliminate
the
employees,
too.
how
does
that
suddenly
turn
the
prior
action
into
a
discriminatory
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
they...
on
your
theory
i
guess
they
didn't.
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
say
there
won't
be
any
more
benefits.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
wanted
to
go
to
the...
oh,
you
are
quite
right
there's
a
countervailing
sort
of
political
consideration
within
the
marketplace
because
you
then
end
up
with
a
bunch
of
employees
who
are
mad,
but
if,
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
want
to
accept
that
burden,
they
can...
the
employer
could
do
that
and
couldn't
have...
could
have
done
it
here,
i
take
it,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
because
you
had
a
cba,
yes.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
say,
i
take
it,
that
if
there
had
been
further
reasons,
in
addition
merely
to
the
cost
of
providing
these
benefits,
for
wanting
to
get
rid
of
this
division
and
contract
out,
that
if
the
existence
of
those
further
reasons...
say
they
were...
they
happened
to
have
a
bunch
of
very
inefficient
employees
and
so
on...
the
existence
of
those
further
reasons
would
preclude
a
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is
in
theory,
although
it
would
be
difficult
in
practice,
because
if
you
concede,
and
if
we
were
to
hold
that
so
long
as
the
avoidance
of
the
medical...
the
cost
of
welfare
benefits
was
only
one
among
other
reasons
that
that
would
be
legitimate,
then
every
employer
who
wanted
to
do
what
this
employer
did
would
simply
claim
other
reasons,
so
it
would
be
difficult
of
proof,
even
though
in
theory
there
would
be
a
bright
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean...
don't
you
open...
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
floodgate
or
not,
but
don't
you
open
the
gate
by
conceding
that
if
there
are
other
reasons
in
addition
to
the
ones
given
by
the
employer
here,
there
wouldn't
necessarily
be
any
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that,
that
if
there
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
generalized
desire
to
save
money,
or
to
get
more
efficient
work...
work
done
more
efficiently,
and
the
desire
to
save
money
on
the
welfare
plan
is
only
one
component
among
several
others
that
add
up
to
the
reasons
for
wanting
to
make
this
change,
i
thought
you
conceded
that
under
those
circumstances
the
employer
could
do
what
this
employer
did,
and
it
would
not
violate
the
statute.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's...
but
let's
assume
it's
at
least
real.
forget
the
question
of
proof
now.
let's
just
assume
that
there
are
these
other
reasons,
but
among
them,
one
among
them
is
the
desire
to
save
the
cost
of
the
welfare
plan.
does...
and
so
the
employer
eliminates
the
division
and
contracts
out.
does
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
we
accept
the
argument...
assuming
that,
and
if
we
accept
the
argument
or
the
distinction
that
i
thought
you
were
drawing
before,
that
distinction
seemed
to
be
that
the...
at
least
with
respect
to
welfare
benefits
violation
or
not
turned
on
whether
there
was
a
specific
employee
in
mind,
whether
there
was
a
specific
accrual
of
benefit
in
mind,
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
suppose
what
the
employer
did
here
would
be
perfectly
permissible
under
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
includes
our
case,
then
why
do
we
bother
about
the
specificity
of
the
employee?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
targeting
of
the
individual
is
not
essential
to
the
answer,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
changing
justice
stevens'
hypo.
he...
justice
stevens'
hypo
as
i
understood
it
was,
the
only
reason
is
to
save
these
costs.
he
may
not
wish
his
employees
ill,
perhaps,
but
his
only
reason
is
to
save
the
costs.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
you
can't
split
it
as
fine,
it
seems
to
me,
in
his
case
as
you're
trying
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
under
the
cba.
justice
david
h.
souter
under
the
cba.
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
has
the
cba
got
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
510?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it's
a
violation
of
the
cba.
what's
it
got
to
do
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
the
expectation
any
more
concrete
simply
because
there
happens
also
to
be
a
cba?
why
isn't
there
an
equally
concrete
expectation
when
he
simply
establishes
the
plan
and
says,
you
work
for
me,
you
get
the
benefits
of
the
plan?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
act
has
to
be
specific
to
the
employee?
in
other
words,
if
it
is
specific
to
the
employee...
a
is
about
to
become
60
years
old,
b
is
about
to
have
a
tooth
extracted,
what-not.
that
is
the
kinds
of
attainment
that
you're
talking
about
here,
and
therefore
the
line
is
drawn
between
acts
intended
to...
in
effect
to
preclude
benefits
to
specific
individuals
as
opposed
to
acts
on
a
more
global
scale.
is
that
where
you
draw
the
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
exercise
clause.
if
we
allow
that
the
exercise
clause
can
be
circumvented,
how
do
we
draw...
that
circumvention
of
the
exercise
clause
would
state
a
violation,
how
do
we
draw
the
line?
why
doesn't
that
swallow
the
attainment
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
do
it
on
the
specific
employee
basis.
