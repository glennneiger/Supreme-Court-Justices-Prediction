we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-491,
inter-modal
rail
employees
association
v.
the
santa
fe
railway.
mr.
schwartz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schwartz,
some
of
us
are
having
difficulty
in
hearing
you.
i
wonder,
could
you
speak
up
a
little
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
schwartz,
the
question
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
is
based
entirely,
as
i
would
read
the
question,
on
section
510
of
erisa,
and
that
certainly
was
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
and
some
of
my
colleagues
i
think
are
expressing
the
view
what
has
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
all
that
got
to
do
with
it
if
you're
claiming
under
section
510?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
kind
of
weasel
words.
the...
important
in
understanding
the
context
in
which
it
arose.
if
it's
based
on
510,
tell
me
specifically,
if
you
would,
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
to
do
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
i
read
the
respondent's
brief
they
no
longer
support
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
respect,
or
at
least
they
say
you
don't
have
to
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
that
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
say
attainment,
though,
suggested
something
that
was
to
be...
to
happen
in
the
future?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
suppose
the
employer's
argument
is
that
if
something
had
not
been
attained
as
of
the
date
this
action
was
taken,
it
didn't
violate
that
section,
section
510.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
understood
their
argument
to
focus
more
on
the
phrase
accompanying
the
word
attainment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
supposing
you've
been
working
at
a
place
11
months
and
you
don't
get
medical
benefits
until
you've
been
there
for
a
year.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
fit
very
nicely
under
the
attainment
clause.
you're
fired
at
the
end
of
11
months
because
the
employee
doesn't
want
you
to
get
medical
benefits.
but
that
really
isn't
this
case,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schwartz.
ms.
pillard.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
question
presented
certainly
covers
that
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pillard.
your--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--ms.
pillard,
your
time
has
expired,
and
i
expect
you
to
sit
down
when
i
tell
you
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
holzhauer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
holzhauer.
the
case
is
submitted.
