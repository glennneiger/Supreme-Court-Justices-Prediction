mr.
schwartz,
is
it
true
that
this
employer
could
not
use
the
change
route
that
you
say
could
have
been
used
to
accomplish
this
purpose?
that
is,
these
benefits
do
not
vest.
therefore,
the
plan
could
be
amended
to
reduce
them.
the
benefits
could
be
terminated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
so
you
are...
the
answer
to
my
question
is
there
was
no
amendment
route
here--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
it
was
a
multiemployer
plan.
therefore,
suppose
an
employer
wants
to
accomplish
that
objective
just
as
a
matter
of
cutting
costs.
you're
saying
it's
impossible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
same
thing
that
you
are
calling
a
conspiracy
and...
could
have
been
done
were
this
only
a
single
employer
plan
as
distinguished
from
a
multiemployer
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
something
about
the
bankrupt
teamsters
union,
and
as
i
understand
it
both
the
old
employer,
the
santa
fe
group,
and
the
new
employer,
the
its,
both
were
units
that
had
teamsters
representing
the
workers.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
was
it
the
same
local
in
both
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
union
has
not
taken
any
position
throughout
these
proceedings,
these
510
proceedings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
strange,
when
you,
whether
for
background
or
whatever
reason,
talk
about
labor
law
rights,
and
the
union
has
not
been
heard
from.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schwartz,
i
thought
your
position
was,
this
is
a
pleading
case
and
you
did
allege
the
employer
did
this
for
the
specific
purpose
of,
and
if
that's...
if
this
is
a
determination
to
be
made
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
then
whether
there
were
other
reasons
that
you
might
fail
as
a
matter
of
proof,
but
at
this
stage
you
made
the
allegation
that
you
say
should
get
you
through
the
door.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
pillard--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--attaining--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
aren't
they
troubling...
isn't
that
issue
troubling
courts
all
over
the
land?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
holzhauer,
i
take
it
from
your
argument,
and
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
the
reasoning
you've
just
developed,
the
motive
is
simply
to
cut
cost,
not
to
retaliate
against
any
employees,
would
apply
to
pensions
that
haven't
yet
vested
as
well
as
health
and
welfare
arrangements,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
rejecting
the
ninth
circuit
line
in
two
ways.
first
you
say
that
there
isn't
this
distinction
between
pension
plans
and
health
and
welfare
plans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
and
that
as
far
as
the
pension
plan
goes,
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong,
although
you
didn't
take
a
cross-appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they're
not...
they're
often
less
than
what
the
plan
would
give.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
are
you
saying
that
the
d.c.
circuit
approach
in
the
andes
case,
they
didn't
even
need
to
get
to
anything
like,
what
does
the
word
discharge
mean?
