ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
yes.
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
section
510
is
not
limited
to
pension
rights
or
rights
capable
of
vesting,
but
also
covers
rights
to
welfare
benefits.
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
to
the
contrary
cannot
be
squared
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
section
510
uses
the
general
term,
employee
benefit
plans,
which
the
statute
defines
to
include
both
pension
plans
and
welfare
benefit
plans.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
in
our
view,
generally
that
situation
would
not
show
proof
of
the
prohibited
purpose,
with
one
caveat.
if
the
choice
of
the
employees
whose
jobs
were
being
contracted
out
were
based
on
the
fact
that
they
were
a
group
of
employees
who
were
imminently
going
to
vest,
or
who
the
employer
knew
were
ill,
for
example,
as
a
result
of--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--in
our
view
that
would
not
be
covered.
what
is
covered,
however,
and
what
we
believe
is
a
core
case
is
a
case
of
a
person
who
the
employer
knows
has
become
ill,
and
who
is
fired
before
that
person
has
seen
the
doctor,
and
therefore
before
the
right
to
medical
care
has
actually
accrued.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
this
is
a
very
common
scenario,
where
an
employer
has
offered
health
care
coverage
with
particular
coverage
levels,
and
when
an
employee
becomes
ill,
although
the
employer
would
be
free
generally
to
amend
the
plan
to
eliminate
coverage
for
an
illness
that
seems
too
expensive
or
burdensome,
instead,
the
employee
keeps
the
plan
in
place
with
respect
to
other
employees
but
discharges
the
employee
to
interfere
with
the
attainment
of
the
right
to
claim
coverage
under
the
plan.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it
might
with
an
experience-related
plan,
that's
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
and
that
motive
would
arise
even
with
the
prospect
of
the
medical
care
being
undergone,
and
therefore
before
the
right
had
itself
accrued
and
become--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--an
enforceable
right
under
the
plan.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that
would
be
a
violation--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--justice
scalia,
under
the
first
clause
of
section
510--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--which
prohibits
discharge
for
the
purpose--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--as
a
result
of
exercising
a
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
do
want
to
get
to
this
case,
but
i
would
note
that
as
a
prudential
matter
we
don't
think
the
court
should
reach
the
alternative
grounds,
because
they
were
not
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
were
not
decided
by
that
court.
they
weren't
raised
in
the
petition,
and
they
were
not
briefed
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
in
fact,
there's
very
little
development
on
the
issue
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
so
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
think
the
court
need
not
read
that
issue,
but
i
do
want
to
address
that--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--as
a...
yes,
i
think
you're
right
that
it
is
encompassed,
it's
fairly
encompassed
within
the
question
presented.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
justice
souter,
in
our
view
the
core
case
includes
the
case
where
the
employer
has
a
specific
employee
in
mind,
but
it
also
includes
our
case.
it's
important
to
note
that
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it's
important
to
note
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
a
claim
for
interference
with
pension
benefits
without
any
additional
allegations
beyond
a
general
allegation
of
purpose.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
and
if
that's
enough
on
that
side
without
a
targeting
or
identification
of
an
individual
employee,
we
submit
that
it
should
be
enough
on
this
side.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
a
difference--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--right.
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
although
we
have
here,
at
the
pleading
stage
we
don't
have
the
facts
developed
and
so
it's
very
difficult
to
say
what
kind
of
proof
would
suffice
to
be
proof
of
purpose,
really
a
lot
of
the
discussion
about
whether
targeting
is
required,
or
a
foreseeable
rise
in
cost
is
required,
is
a
discussion
that
really
goes
to
what
counts
as
proof
of
purpose,
whereas
here
we're
at
the
pleading
stage.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
given
that--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--our
test
is
that
the
purpose
has
to
be
a
purpose
to
interfere
with
the
attainment
of
benefits
in
the
sense
that
the
action
has
to
be
taken
not
just
in
spite
of
its
impact
on
benefits
but
because
of
the
impact
on
benefits.
it
has
to
be
a
specific
focus
on
benefits.
now,
let
me
focus
on
this
case.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
not
to
focus
on
benefits
as
such.
here
you
have--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--right,
and--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that's
right,
and
there's
a
general
desire
to
save
costs,
and
where
the
incidental
effect
of
that,
where
the
employer
is
indifferent
as
between
saving
those
costs
out
of
benefits
or
saving
those
costs
in
other
ways,
through
greater
efficiency
or
through
diminution
in
salary,
or
what
have
you,
there's--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
here...
here
you
have
more,
justice
souter.
here
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
employer
had
promised
to
continue
to
pay
benefits
at
a
certain
level
for
a
year,
and--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--and
it
states...
an
instruction--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--this
transaction--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it
has
to
do
with
this.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
it
has
to
do
with
this.
the
section
does
not
cover
any
conceivable
rights
to
which
an
employee
may
become
entitled
in
the
future,
but
it
does
cover
the
situation
in
which
the
employee
has
a
concrete
expectation.
in
the
individual
case,
that
concrete
expectation
is
supplied
by
the
fact
that
the
plan
is
continuing
with
respect
to
the
other
employees,
and
that
expectation
drops
out
when
the
plan
is
legitimately
amended.
in
this
case,
the
concrete
expectation
is
provided
by
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
bargained
with,
has
promised
the
employees
that
it
will
continue
the
coverage
for
an
additional
year.
where
that's
the
case--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--there's
not
that
concrete
expectation
precisely
because
where
action
is
taken
with
respect
to
the
whole
workforce
the
plan
could
simply
be
terminated
and
in
fact
if
the
employer
wanted
to
protect
itself
as
a
formal
matter
maybe
it
would
terminate
the
plan
and
then
fire
the
employees,
or
lay
the
employees
off.
here
you
have
a
situation
that
was
structured
to
strip
these
employees--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--of
the
rights
they
would
have
had
for
the
additional
year.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice.
