this
happens
all
the
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
told
me
those
are
real
life
situations
that
happen
often,
you've
answered
a
question
i
was
about
to
ask.
that
is,
i
was...
i
understand
that
the
text
covers
health
plans
as
well
as
other
plans,
but
i
couldn't
really
understand
what
real
life
situation
they
were
addressing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
i
didn't
know...
the
chief
justice
gave
a
hypothetical
of
a
company
that
has
a
health
plan
but
you
only
come
under
it
after
1
year.
i'm
not...
you
know,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
know
of
any
that
exist
like
that.
you
could
create
one.
but
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
what
congress
had
in
mind
bringing
these
other
things
in,
and
it's
this
situation
that
you've
just
described.
or,
for
example,
an
employee
who
has
a
child
with
a
serious
heart
condition,
and
the
employer
knows
that
to
take
care
of
that
child
is
going
to
cost
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
health
care.
now,
if
that
happens,
does
that
cause
the
employer's
premiums
to
go
up,
basically?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
wouldn't
be
a
violation...
if
i
understand
your
interpretation
correctly,
it
wouldn't
be
a
violation
if
you
fire
the
employee
after
the
child
has
already
received
some
benefits,
or
if
you
fire
the
employee
who
himself
has
a
serious
condition
after
he's
already
gotten
some
of
the
benefits.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
exercising
a
right.
i
hope
we
can
get
to
this
case,
because
the
examples
you've
been
given
of
retaliation,
of
discharging
a
particular
employee
because
that
employee
is
going
to
cost
too
much,
there
are
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
cases
dealing
with
that
discrimination,
but
here
we
have
something
different.
we
have
not,
we're
going
to
discharge
employee
a
because
we've
heard
he
has
a
heart
disease.
it
is
en
masse.
it
is
faceless.
it
says,
all
of
the
workers
in
this
unit
go,
and
then
we're
going
to
have
a
subcontract.
that's
quite
different
than
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
says,
don't
fire
the
guy
just
before
his
pension
vests,
and
you
say
that
same
thinking
transposes
to
health
and
welfare
benefits,
but
what
about
the
significant
difference
that
this
isn't
a
case
about
discharging
a
particular
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
that
any
different?
i
mean,
that's
just
like
a
lot
of
individual
people
who
are
submitting
too
many
claims--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
said
earlier
that
if
you
have
a
lot
of
individual
people
who
are
about
to
vest--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
would
be
a
violation
if
you
closed
down
that
plant.
why
is
it
any
different
if
you
close
down
a
plant
because
you
have
a
lot
of
individual
people
who
have
already
vested
and
are
just
sucking
the
money
out
of
the
company
with
a
lot
of
claims?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
an
exercise
clause
as
well,
as
you've
just
acknowledged.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
that
clause.
it's
also
the
exercise
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
holzhauer,
given
your
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
of
what
use
is
the
application
of
the
attainment
clause
to
plans
other
than
pension
plans?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
what
congress
was
worried
about,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
employers
who
keep--
justice
antonin
scalia
--90
days,
firing
people
after
89
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
insist
it
applies
only
to
eligibility.
but
then
why,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
did
you
get
into
the
question
of
circumvention?
you've
either
attained
or
you
haven't
attained.
