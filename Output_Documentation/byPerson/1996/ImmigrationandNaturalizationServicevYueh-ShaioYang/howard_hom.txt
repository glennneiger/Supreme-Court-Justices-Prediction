mr.
howard
hom
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
basic
points
that
we
need
to
address.
number
1,
this
case,
the
facts
of
this
case
boils
down
to
just
one
simple
fact.
mr.
yang's
assumed
identity
as
the
husband
of
a
united
states
citizen,
just
one
basic
fact.
secondly,
this
is
not
a
case
of
abuse
of
discretion.
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction
because
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
ins's
own
interpretation,
prior
case
precedents,
legislative
history,
and
the
policy
and
the
purpose
behind
this
waiver
all
indicate
that
the
original
fraud
must
never
be
weighed
in
the
decision
to
grant
or
deny
a
waiver.
mr.
howard
hom
yes,
it's
subparagraph
(ii)
of
241(a)(1)(h),
and
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
5a
and
6a
is
the
section
of
law,
and
in
subparagraph
(ii)
on
page
6a
it
states
that
the
alien
was
in
possession
of
an
immigrant
visa
or
equivalent
document
and
was
otherwise
admissible,
and
that's
the
key
phrase,
otherwise
admissible.
mr.
howard
hom
because
the
purpose
of
the
waiver
was
to--
mr.
howard
hom
--oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
hom
right.
the
waiver
serves
to
take
away
that
fraud.
that's
why
that
phrase,
"otherwise
admissible",
that's
what
that
refers
to.
otherwise,
other
than
the
fraud.
otherwise
admissible
means
other
than
the
fraud
that
charges
or
that
renders
the
alien
to
become
excludable.
mr.
howard
hom
if
i
could
answer
the
question
this
way,
your
honor,
there
are
three
steps
in
the
processing
of
an
application
for
a
waiver
before
the
immigration
judge.
the
first
step
is,
is
there
a
requisite
family
relationship,
the
second
step,
subparagraph
(ii),
is
the
alien
otherwise
admissible?
in
other
words,
is
he
a
criminal?
has
he
committed
other
heinous
acts
but
he
cannot
be
neither
waivered
because
of
the
fraud,
which
is
212(a)(6)(c),
and
that's
what
otherwise
admissible
refers
to--
mr.
howard
hom
--yes,
your
honor.
once
we
reach
that
threshold
that
the
fraud
is
taken
off
the
table
and
not
to
be
considered
in
order
for
the
alien
to
apply
for
the
waiver,
then
for
the
immigration
service
to
turn
around
and
look
at
that
very
same
act
would
really
nullify
subparagraph
(ii).
it
wouldn't
even
have
to
be
there
at
all
if
the
attorney
general
had
absolute
unfettered
discretion.
the
language
of
the
waiver
would
merely
say,
if
the
alien
has
a
family
relationship,
then
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
the
waiver
may
be
granted,
so
there
must
be
some
meaning--
mr.
howard
hom
--and
that's
why
i
say,
it's
not
a
matter
of
discretion,
your
honor,
it's
really
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
subparagraph
(ii)
takes--
mr.
howard
hom
--your
honor,
the
change
to
add
the
word
discretion
in
1981
did
not
change
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
waiver.
even
prior
to
the
1981
waiver
change
there
was
a
separate
exclusion
ground
with
a
parallel
waiver,
section
212(i),
which
permitted
the
immigration
service
to
grant
a
waiver
in
its
discretion
for
similar
types
of
frauds.
the
immigration
service
adopted
the
position
in
the
parallel
deportation
waiver
in
now
241(a)(1)(h)
that
otherwise
admissible
means
you
put
aside
the
initial
fraud
that
renders
him
excludable
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
the
waiver,
and
then
the
immigration
judge,
or
the
immigration
service,
may
look
at
other
adverse
factors.
for
example,
if
the
immigrant
had
killed
somebody
to
obtain
that
person's
passport,
or
visa
documentation,
that
would
render
the
immigrant
excludable
under
other
acts,
sections
of
the
act,
so
that's
the
purpose
of
otherwise
admissible,
to
account
for
the
concern
that
your
honors
have
expressed
previously
that
there
may
be
certain
factors
in
the
commission
of
the
fraud
that
are
so
heinous
that
we
as
human
beings
would
not
accept.
mr.
howard
hom
i'm
not
sure
if
that's--
mr.
howard
hom
--correct,
so--
mr.
howard
hom
--well,
we're
saying
that
if
the
alien
is...
in
the
determination
of
the
waiver
we
look
at
other
factors
other
than
the
fraud
factor,
which
is
212(a)(6)(c),
which
is
not
listed
there,
but
you
could
see
the
parallel
exceptions
for
(5)(a)
and
(7)(a)
of
the
statute,
so
if
an
alien
is
encompassed
within
the
grounds
of
212(a)(6)(c),
212(a)(5)(a)
and
(7)(a),
those
disqualifying
factors
cannot
be
held
against
the
immigrant
in
the
determination
of
the
waiver,
so
the
immigration
judge
is
permitted
only
to
look
at
other
factors,
other
than
those
three
factors.
mr.
howard
hom
if
we
look
at
the
initial
language
of
241(a)(1)(h)
on
page
5a,
the
provisions
of
this
paragraph
relating
to
the
deportation
of
aliens
within
the
united
states
on
the
ground
that
they
were
excludable
at
the
time
of
entry
as
aliens,
described
in
section
1182(6)(c).
so
if
you
look
at
the
classification
described
in
212(a)(6)(c),
which
is
on
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
2a,
the
language
there
states...
misrepresentation
is
the
caption...
any
alien
who
by
fraud
or
wilfully
misrepresenting
a
material
fact
seeks
to
procure
or
has
sought
to
procure
or
has
procured
a
visa
or
other
documentation
or
entry
into
the
united
states,
those
words
there
clearly
show
that
acts
could
have
occurred
not
just
at
the
time
of
entry,
but
in
the
past
in
seeking
the
visa,
or
actually
having
obtained
the
visa,
so
it's
very
clear
that
the
statute
that
grants
the
waiver
is
not
limited
to
acts
occurring
at
the
time
of
entry,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
hom
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
hom
and
the
historical
development
of
the
act...
of
the
waiver--
mr.
howard
hom
--well,
that's
not
inconsistent
with
212(a)(6)(c).
the
statutory
language
talks
and
uses
words
in
terms
of
present
tense
and
past
tense,
so
that
those
acts
which
are
related
to
the
visa
procurement,
yes.
if
there
are
other
acts
not
related
to
the
visa
procurement,
then
he
would
be
otherwise
inadmissible
and
the
waiver
could
be
denied,
so
i
don't
see
that
as
inconsistent
with
our
position,
and
i
think
that
that
should
lay
to
rest
a
lot
of
concerns
that
the
waiver
is
carte
blanche
to
let
immigrants
come
in,
commit
heinous
crimes,
and
get
away
with
murder.
mr.
howard
hom
no--
mr.
howard
hom
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
hom
no,
your
honor.
the
waiver
that
is
being...
the
fraud
that
is
being
waived
is
the
fraud
to
come
to
the
united
states.
frauds
that
are
unrelated
that
occur
afterwards...
tax
fraud,
welfare
fraud...
all
those
are
separate,
independent
acts
which
render
the
immigrant
deportable
under
different
sections
of
241(a).
mr.
howard
hom
citizenship,
on
the
application
mr.
yang
repeated
the
same
statements,
that
his
wife
is
mary
wong--
mr.
howard
hom
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
a
case
of
an
assumed
identity,
where
the
immigrant
comes
to
the
united
states
with
a
new
identity
as
the
husband
of
mary
wong,
and
everything
that
he
does
after
that
is
as
the
husband
of
mary
wong.
mr.
howard
hom
he
repeats
the
same
statement,
your
honor,
that
he
is
the
husband--
mr.
howard
hom
--well,
your
honor,
the...
the
ins
has
always
interpreted
the
waiver
to
waive
the
conditions
of
the
fraud,
and
until
this
case
there
has
never
been
a
slicing
up
of
the
fraud
into
subcomponents.
mr.
howard
hom
that's--
mr.
howard
hom
--the
ninth
circuit
looks
at
mr.
yang's
assumed
identity
as
one
fraud
rather
than
individual
acts.
mr.
howard
hom
correct,
but
the
statutory
language
and
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
waiver
was
to
not
only
help
displaced
refugees,
but
there's
a
subsection
that
granted
the
waiver
to
people
with
family
relations
who
may
not
have--
mr.
howard
hom
--excuse
me.
mr.
howard
hom
that's
correct,
and
if...
after
the
threshold
is
made,
the
attorney
general
looks
at
other
factors
other
than
the
fraud,
because
that
is
the
act
for
which
he
is
being
forgiven
for.
mr.
howard
hom
but
the--
mr.
howard
hom
--only
if
it
is
not
related
to
the
initial
entry.
mr.
howard
hom
the
concept
of
the
fraud
that
exists
at
the
time
of
entry.
this
is
the
same
fraud
that
exists
at
the
time
of
entry.
mr.
howard
hom
and
for
the
same
purpose
of
his
immigration
status.
it's
not
to--
mr.
howard
hom
--every
immigrant,
your
honor,
comes
to
america
for
the
purpose
of
settling
here
permanently,
and
citizenship
is
the
ultimate,
is
the
final
step
in
his
process
in
coming
to
the
united
states.
mr.
howard
hom
well,
that
was
a
matter
that
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
back
to
the
immigration
judge
for
redetermination.
cases
have
held
that
false
statements
to
the
immigration
judge
are
properly
considered
in
the
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
howard
hom
the
general
rule
that
false
statements
to
the
judge--
mr.
howard
hom
--statements
to
the
judge,
correct.
mr.
howard
hom
yes.
mr.
howard
hom
yes,
what
that
refers
to,
your
honor,
is
that
if
the
immigrant
had
applied...
you
have
two
situations.
the
immigrant
applies
for
his
immigrant
visa
based
upon
a
labor
certification,
for
example,
and
he...
if
he
properly
processed
that
labor
certification,
but
submitted
fraudulent
documents,
then
that
is
the
kind
of
fraud
that
directs...
directly
results
from
that
act.
mr.
howard
hom
correct.
mr.
howard
hom
correct.
mr.
howard
hom
i'd
like
to...
i
think
i
hear
what
your
honor's
saying--
mr.
howard
hom
--well--
mr.
howard
hom
--correct.
that's--
mr.
howard
hom
--thank
you,
your
honor,
but
there's
also
one
other
aspect
of
that.
if
an
immigrant
had
bought
the
visa
outside
of
the
consular
context
instead
of
in
the
process
of
applying
for
an
immigration
visa--
mr.
howard
hom
--oh,
that's
correct,
but
there's
another
aspect
to
it.
there
are
two
explanations.
i
was...
that's
one,
and
the
second
one
is,
where
the
fraudulent
documentation,
say
the
fake
passport
was
a
counterfeit
that
he'd
purchased
down
the
street,
so
it
was
not
part
of
a
fraud
to
the
united
states
government.
as
your
honor
had
pointed
out
earlier,
if
he
had
divorced
his
wife
and
had
not
made
that
representation
or
showed
that
divorce
document
to
the
consular
officer
at
his
visa
interview,
then
that
would
not
be
the
kind
of
fraud
that's
encompassed
and
would
not
be
the
kind
of
fraud
that
would
be
forgiven
by
this
waiver,
so
this
is
not
a
charter
of
amnesty.
there
are
cases
of
frauds
and
bad
acts
that
may
be
punished,
and
properly
so.
there
are
criminal
sanctions
that
would
be
available,
and
once
criminal
convictions
are
obtained,
then
the
alien
becomes
inadmissible
under
various
sections
of
212(a),
so
that
the
integrity
of
the
immigration
system
is
preserved.
there
are
not
a
whole
lot
of
waivers
granted
under
this
particular
section.
mr.
howard
hom
possibly,
but
that's
the
very
waiver
that
is...
the
reason
why
the
waiver
is
there.
mr.
howard
hom
yes,
if
the
fraudulent
conduct
relates
back
to
the
initial
one.
the
appropriate
solution--
mr.
howard
hom
--incorrect.
the
key
phrase
was
eligible
for
the
waiver.
subparagraph
(ii)
specifically
states
that
if--
mr.
howard
hom
--right,
but
he
would
not
be
eligible
for
the
waiver
because
he
would
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude,
which
are
other
grounds
enumerated
in
subparagraph
(ii)
which
are
not
listed
there,
but
that's
what
the
reference--
mr.
howard
hom
--not
necessarily
indicted.
if
there
are...
if
there's
an
admission
that
he
had
committed
the
elements
of
the
act
that
involves--
mr.
howard
hom
--he
did
sign
those
documents,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
waiver.
mr.
howard
hom
that's
correct.
his
wife,
mr.
yang's
wife
had
assumed
the
identity
of
mary
wong.
he
did
not
represent
that
he
was
married
to
a
deceased
person.
he
was
saying
that
his
wife,
his
current
wife,
who
used
a
new
name,
and
that's
why
i've
been
trying
to
explain
that
this
is
a
matter
of
an
assumed
identity
as
opposed
to
a...
another
type
of
elaborate
fraud,
as
your
honors
have
eluded
to.
mr.
howard
hom
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
there
was
one
immigration
examiner
who
was
indicted
and
convicted
for
having
received
bribes,
or
soliciting
bribes
in
this
respect,
and
that's
in
the
brief.
if
there
was
criminal
acts
that
could
be
charged
against
mr.
yang,
i'm
pretty
sure
that
the
fbi
would
have
ferreted
out
those
facts--
mr.
howard
hom
--yes,
he
did,
but--
mr.
howard
hom
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
there
was
evidence
to
lead
to
a
criminal
conviction,
one
should
have
been
brought,
and
then
he
should
have
been
convicted
and,
if
convicted,
deported
on
that
basis,
and
not
deported
based
upon
some
exception
or
some
misconstruction
of
a
statute
that
has
very
salutary
purposes
behind
it
just
because
of
potential
prosecution.
if
there
was
a
prosecution,
then
he
renders
himself
not
to
be
otherwise
admissible
within
the
language
of
subparagraph
(ii)
and
the
person
could
be
deported,
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
denying
the
waiver.
mr.
howard
hom
the
waiver
focuses
on
two
points.
number
1,
at
the
time
of
entry,
is
he
within
this
classification
of
having
committed
this
fraud,
so
he
commits
this
one
particular
fraud,
and
he's
warranted
with
it
and
it
becomes
an
individual
part
of
his
new
identity...
there's
just
no
way
he
could
shake
that.
so
when
the
person
applies
for
his
social
security
card
he
puts
down
on
the
form
he's
married.
when
he
applies
for...
when
he
submits
his
income
tax
returns
he
says
he's
married,
and
i'm
sure
he
put
down
he
was
married
to
mary
wong.
all
these
are
incidental
aspects
of
his
having
assumed
this
new
identity
in
coming
to
america,
and
not
some
separate
independent
fraud
that
has
no
relationship.
if
he
committed
other
frauds,
of
tax
fraud,
for
example,
then
he
would
be
deportable
on
those
independently,
and
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
denial
of
a
waiver
in
those
cases,
but
the
fact
that
he's
deportable
on
some
other
ground.
mr.
howard
hom
and
that's
the
purpose--
mr.
howard
hom
--unless
there
are
other
adverse
factors,
other
than
that
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
hom
that's
our
position,
your
honor,
the
same
fact.
the
purpose
of
the
waiver
is
not
to
relieve
mr.
yang
of
any
obligations.
he
could
still
be
prosecuted
criminally.
his
citizenship
was
denied.
mr.
howard
hom
at
the
time
there
was
a
mandatory
waiver
of
deportation.
there
is
also
a
discretionary
waiver
for
exclusion,
and
the
immigration
service's
interpretation
or
application
of
the
discretionary
waiver
was
also
to
disregard
the
fraud
that
renders
him
inadmissible
in
deciding
discretion,
so
that's
the
stage
that
was
set
when
congress
in
1981
passed
the
new
legislation
to
add
on
the
word
discretion
for
the
deportation
waiver.
it
conforms--
mr.
howard
hom
--correct,
to
make
it
discretionary,
but
nevertheless,
that
did
not
change
congress'
understanding
as
to
the
interpretation,
the
proper
application
of
the
statute,
because
the
immigration
service
had
consistently
in
the
alonzo
case
in
1979,
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
immigration
service
said,
yes,
frauds--
mr.
howard
hom
--relative
to
the
initial
fraud,
correct.
it
would
permit
the
attorney
general
to
look
at
other
factors,
and
we
see
from
the
discussion
this
morning
that
there
are
other
factors
that
should
render
an
alien
inadmissible...
excuse
me,
that
should
result
in
the
waiver
being
denied,
even
though
it
does
not
render
the
alien
deportable
and
inadmissible.
so
there
are
acts
which
don't
amount
to
a
deportable
act,
but
which
nevertheless
i
think
we
are
agreed
are
reprehensible
acts
and
should
be
punished
with
the
waiver
being
denied.
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
to
focus
on
the
family.
the
waiver
was
for
the
purpose,
was
designed
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
families.
mr.
howard
hom
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
hom
correct.
mr.
howard
hom
and
there
are
some
acts
that
are
so
reprehensible
that
even
before
the
1981
amendment
to
make
it
discretionary--
mr.
howard
hom
--we
see
that
persons
who
assisted
in
nazi
persecution
or
engaged
in
genocide
were
not
permitted
to
apply
for
the
waiver,
and
that
was
before
it
was
made
discretionary,
so
there
were
people
who
covered
up
their
past
involvement
and
came
to
the
united
states
after
world
war
ii,
and
these
people
certainly
should
be
thrown
out
of
the
country,
but
because
the
fraud
was
being
forgiven,
the
ins
had
no
way
to
deport
those
people.
they
had
the
relatives,
and
the
waiver
had
to
be
granted.
so
congress
in
1978
added
on
paragraph
(4)(d)
relating
to
genocide
and
said
those
people,
they
do
such
terrible
things,
they
don't
even
get
a
chance
to
talk
about
a
waiver.
other
people
on
the
other
hand,
u.s.
citizens'
parents,
children,
spouses,
they
have
a
chance
to
ask
that
their
loved
ones
be
forgiven
so
that
they
may
stay
in
this
country,
and
that's
the
focus.
it's
not
to
reward
bad
acts,
but
to
preserve
family
ties,
to
consider
the
feelings
of
u.s.
citizens,
and
not
the
alien
who
committed
the
fraud.
mr.
howard
hom
well,
in
the
determination
of
discretion
the
depth
of
the
family
ties
certainly
would
be
a
factor.
mr.
howard
hom
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
hom
that's
correct.
thank
you.
