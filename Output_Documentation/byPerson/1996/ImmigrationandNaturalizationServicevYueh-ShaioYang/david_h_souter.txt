justice
david
h.
souter
but
are
you
saying
that
the
attorney
general
would
be
within
her
discretion
to
say,
i
will
never
exercise
my
discretion
to
waive
entry
fraud?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
begs
the
question.
the
only
fact
you
know
is
that
she
says,
i'm
adopting
a
policy.
i
will
never
exercise
discretion,
no
matter
what
the
circumstances,
to
waive
entry
fraud.
would
that
be
lawful
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
my
question
suggested
that
that
was
her
across-the-board
policy
for
all
cases
in
which
the
statute
might
be
applied.
i'm
not
asking
a
question
about
subclasses.
i'm
talking
about
the
entire
class
of
possible
waivers,
and
construed
that
broadly,
would
it
be
within
her
discretion
to
say,
i
will
never
exercise
my
discretion
in
favor
of
waiver?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
brinkmann,
may
i
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
and
make
sure
i
understand
you
on
one
point,
and
that
is,
i
understand
you
to
have
said
that
the
policy
of
waiving
any
initial
fraud
applies
to
any
initial
fraud
regardless
of
what
it's
circumstances
may
be.
in
other
words,
there's
no
minor
fraud
versus
major
fraud.
all
frauds
are
equal
if
they
are
initial
fraud,
initial
entry
frauds,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
what
if
you
had
a
fraud
case
in
which
you...
it
was
shown
that
the
documents
were
procured
by
the
entrant
by
holding
a
gun
to
the
head
of
officials
in
foreign
countries
to
force
them
to
produce
the
fraudulent
documents,
would
that
be
like
all
other
kinds
of
frauds?
would
that
be
within
the
policy
of
waiving
all
initial
entry
frauds?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
want
to
know
what
her
policy...
i
just
want
to
understand
what
her
policy
is
now,
and
would
that
fall
within
her
policy
of
waiving
initial
entry
fraud
as
you
understand
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
maybe
not
all
frauds
are
equal
for...
initial
entry
frauds
are
equal.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
sets
a
condition
upon
the--
--yes.
--exercise
of
discretion...
but
it
does
not,
it
seems
to
me,
to
address
the
substance
of
what
that
discretion
may
consider.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
on
your
theory
of
relationship,
how
do
you
relate
the
misrepresentation
about
the
financial
status?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
agree
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
agree
with
that?
you
do
not
contest
that
general
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
doesn't
prove
anything.
you
acknowledge
that
that's
waivable.
the
later
one
may
be,
too.
