the
statute
does
circumscribe
discretion
in
one
respect,
does
it
not,
or
perhaps
not,
because
the
sentence
is
difficult.
the
last
sentence
of
sub
(h),
a
waiver
of
deportation
for
fraud
granted
under
this
subparagraph
shall
also
operate
to
waive
deportation
based
on
the
grounds
of
inadmissibility
at
entry.
what's
the
function
of
that
sentence,
other
than
to
circumscribe
or
control
the
discretion
of
the
ag?
maybe
you'll
tell
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
an
interpretation
of
the
discretion
once
exercised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
be
relevant
in
a
later
application
for
citizenship,
or
something
like
that?
is
that
why
it's
important?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
to
just
restate
that
a
waiver's
a
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i--
--but
then
that
is
a
narrowing
of
the
attorney
general's
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
circumscribes
the
attorney
general
to
some
extent
in
that
it
does
control
the
extent
of
the
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
say
you're
free
to
depart
from
that
rule
and
that
practice
at
any
time
you
want?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
no
reason
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
take
it
that
you're
saying
that
what
the
attorney
general's
position
has
been,
which
is
to
overlook
the
initial
fraud,
is
suggested
if
not
compelled
by
the
statutory
history.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
me
but
for
the
way
the
attorney
general
has
administered
the
statute
to
date.
i
can't
understand
where
it
gets...
where
that
policy
derives
from,
and
i
thought
your
earlier
remarks
indicated
it
derived
from
the
statutory
history.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
advised
justice
scalia
that
this
was
a
very
small
class.
i
would
have
thought
that
numerically
it's
quite
significant.
do
you
have
any
specific
numbers
as
to
how
small
this
class
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
you're
saying
otherwise
admissible
is
not
important
to
your
interpretation
of
the
act
because
you've
given
it
this
other
meaning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
your
whole...
i
thought
your
whole
case
turned
on
the
otherwise
admissible
language,
and
you've
just
given
what
to
me
is
a
very
plausible
interpretation
of
it
that
the
man
can't
be
a
heinous
criminal,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
how
that
helps
your
case.
