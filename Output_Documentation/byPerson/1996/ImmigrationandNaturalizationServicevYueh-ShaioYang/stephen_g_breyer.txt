justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right,
i
thought...
i
might
not
be,
but
i...
my
reading
of
this
was
initially
there
were
a
group
of
people
who
did
lie
when
they
wanted
to
come
in,
particularly
people
who
came
from
iron
curtain
countries,
and
they
lied
about
what
country
they
were
coming
from
because
they
were
afraid
that
they'd
be
sent
back
and
killed
possibly,
and
congress
initially
passed
this
statute
because
it
wanted
to
say
that
people
like
that
who
had
families
here
should
be
permitted
to
stay
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that's
so,
then
wouldn't
it
raise
a
legal
question
if
the
attorney
general
said
people
just
like
that,
or
who
tell
equivalent
lies
to
that,
would
all
have
to
go
back?
that's
why
i
wonder
if
there
isn't
some
limitation
arising
out
of
the
circumstances
in
this,
where
the
history
of
this,
that
there
were
certain
lies
that
would
be
told
and
the
need
to
reunite
families
was
such
that
that
would
be
a
limitation
on
the
ag's
discretion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
i
can
understand...
just...
how
you
could
say
may
means
must
in
respect
to
the
initial
kinds
of
fraud
that
led
congress
to
grant
the
discretion
in
the
first
place,
which
is
what
you're
arguing
now,
i
think,
but
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
that's
so,
how
then
do
you
get
from
the
language
which
talks
about
a
waiver
being
related...
being
a
direct
result
of
that
fraud...
it
says,
that
fraud,
and
that
fraud
means
the
fraud
that
enabled
the
alien
to
procure
a
visa,
which
this
alien
procured
in
1978.
how
do
you
get
from
that
to
saying
that
the
attorney
general
cannot
take
into
account
her
view
of
a
different
fraud,
i.e.,
one
that
happened
in
1982
that
led
to
the
procurement
of
naturalization
papers?
even
if
you're
going
to
say
they're
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing,
i
don't
see
how
you
escape
the
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
still
referring
to
the
fraud
that
led
him
to
have
procured
the
visa.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
it
right
that
that's
in
(6)(c)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
that
it's
in
(6)(c)...
the
reason
that
it's
in
(6)(c),
as
i
read
it,
is
in
the
preceding
codification
the
words
fraud
and
representation
were
at
the
top
of
(f),
and
they
were
broken
out
by
congress
and
moved
to
(6)(c),
and
so
the
antecedent
for
that
is
now
(6)(c),
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
what
i
said
right?
i
don't
want
you
to
agree
if
it's
not
right.
