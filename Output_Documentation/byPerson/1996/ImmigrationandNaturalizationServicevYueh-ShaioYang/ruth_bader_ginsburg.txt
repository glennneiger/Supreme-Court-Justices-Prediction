justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brinkmann,
there
was
one
time
when
this
kind
of
waiver
for
initial
entry
fraud
was
mandatory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
it
was
urged
that
congress
drop
it
altogether.
instead,
congress
came
up
with
something
in
between.
they
said
the
entry
by
fraud
may,
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
be
waived,
but
if
you
can
respond
to
the
question
that's
been
raised
by
several
of
the
justices,
why
in
the
first
place
did
congress
provide
for
initially
a
mandatory
waiver
and
now
a
discretionary
waiver
for
one
who
has
gained
entry
by
fraud?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there's
also
a
question
of
what
is
the
entry
fraud.
if
i
understand
the
way
this
policy
operates,
in
this
case
there
was
a
sham
divorce
in
taiwan
before
the
petitioner
entered,
and
you
count
that
as
preentry
fraud,
so
if
i
understand
what
the
policy
is
correctly,
all
of
the
other...
the
later
frauds
postentry
were
just
kind
of
surplus.
it
was
enough
to
be
outside
this
policy
that
there
was
a
preentry
fraud.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
wasn't
asking
you
that.
i
may
understand
her
policy
incorrectly,
but
i
thought
your
explanation
of
the
policy
was,
we
will
waive
entry
fraud
but
nothing
before
and
nothing
after,
and
here
there
was
a
before,
and
now
you're
saying
no,
i
don't
have
it
right,
it's
somehow
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
and
not,
we'll
zero
in
on
the
entry
itself,
i
get
there
and
say
i'm
from...
i'm
from
austria
rather
than
from
poland.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
construing
the
statute,
mustn't
we
take
into
account
first
the
words
that
say
"may,
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
"
then
the
history
that
at
one
time
the
waiver
was
mandatory,
and
congress
changed
it
to
make
it
discretionary.
you
seem
to
be...
your
statutory
interpretation
argument
appears
to
be
based
on
the
pre-1981
statute,
when
the
waiver
was
mandatory.
are
you
saying
that
congress...
that
these
words
are
meaningless?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hom,
if
we
looked
at
it
from
this
point
of
view,
let's
say
that
there's
something
ambiguous
about
this,
and
a
judge
is
trying
to
determine
what
the
statute
means
and
says,
well...
let's
assume
that
one
person
who
got
into
the
united
states
without
making
any
false
representations,
no
fraud,
and
once
in
the
united
states
engaged
in
the
very
same
acts
as
occurred
here,
such
a
person
would
be
deportable,
but
if
in
addition
to
engaging
in
those
acts
there
had
been
a
fraud
at
entry,
that
person
is
eligible
for
a
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
a
reasonable
way
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
construe
what
congress
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hom,
there's
one
problem
that
i
have
with
your
notion
that
the
consistent
repetition
of
the
same
misrepresentation
is
a
wash.
as
long
as
you
say
the
same
thing
every
time,
then
it
all
must
be
forgiven.
the
statements
about
mary
wong
who
was
a
dead
soul,
that
were
repeatedly
made
on
documents
signed
by
these
people,
were
they
not
indictable
crimes
as
false
statements
made
to
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
could
have
these
people
engage
in
repeated
criminal
conduct
and
nonetheless
the
attorney
general
must
ignore
that
in
determining
their
eligibility
for
a
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
you
say
yes,
we
should
interpret
congress
to
mean
that
people
who
have
committed
in
the
united
states
repeated
criminal
acts
nonetheless
must
be
eligible
for
this
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
i
said,
eligible
for
the
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
you
say
is,
although
this
conduct,
signing
a
false
statement,
could
be
indicted,
if
it's
not
indicted,
it
must
be
treated
as
if
it
didn't
happen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there...
is...
are
you
denying
that
mr.
yang
signed
papers
and
presented
them
to
immigration
officials
saying
that
he
was
the
husband
of
mary
wong,
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
was
it
not
true
that
at
the
time
he
signed
those
documents
mary
wong
was
a
very
dead
soul?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
seems
to
me
extraordinary
that
congress
would
mandate
that
the
attorney
general
not
consider
what
is
concededly
repeated
crimes
of
false
statements
to
the
united
states
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i've
just
asked
you,
did
he
sign
a
document
in
which
he
said
he
was
the
husband
of
mary
wong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
could
not
have
been
the
husband
of
mary
wong,
as
mary
wong
was
dead.
