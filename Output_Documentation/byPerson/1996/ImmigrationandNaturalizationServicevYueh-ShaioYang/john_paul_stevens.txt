justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
to
confess
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
about
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
take
into
account
the
mere
existence
of
some
fraud,
could
take
into
account
the
nature
of
the
fraud,
but
are
you
saying
that
if...
say
there's
the
mildest
kind
of
form
in
the...
fraud
in
the
world,
that
the
mere
fact
there
was
a
fraud
could
not
be
taken
into
consideration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
matter
how
mild
it
is,
the
attorney
general
has
discretion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me
a
person
could
commit
a
fraud
and
then
claim
a
right
to
remain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
the
statute
that
grants
the
waiver,
it's
the
statute
that
makes
the
immigrant
eligible
to
request
a
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment
on...
go
back
to
sort
of
a
basic
point
of
the...
the
statute
in...
before
its
most
recent
amendment
said
that
the
provisions
of
241
and
so
forth
and
so
on
shall
not
apply
to
an
alien
otherwise
admissible.
now
it
says
with
respect
to
those,
the
attorney
general
may,
in
her
discretion,
waive.
how
do
you
get
around
the
fact
that
one
was
a
mandatory
waiver
and
the
other
is
a
discretionary
waiver?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
to
take
out
the
words,
"shall
not
apply".
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying
is
that
under
the
old
statute
reprehensible
acts
that
were
not
sufficiently
serious
to
be
an
independent
ground
of
deportation
could
not
be
taken
into
consideration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
they
may
now
be
taken
into
consideration.
that,
you
say,
is
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
the
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
your
opponent
agrees
that
there
was...
there
would
have
been
discretion
to
decide
the
case
the
other
way,
take
into...
give
a
greater
weight
to
the
family
ties
and
all
the
rest.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
attorney...
the
immigration
service
could
have
said,
well,
i
think
there
were
two
separate
frauds.
the
4-year-later
business
relating
to
citizenship,
i'll
treat
that
as
separate.
nevertheless,
i
think
these
family
ties
are
so
strong,
and
he's
such
a
successful
businessman
and
all
these
other
things,
i'm
going
to
grant
the
waiver.
they
could
have
granted
the
waiver
even
if
there
are
two
separate
frauds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
if
i
may.
isn't
it
also
true
you'd
take
the
same
position
even
if
they
were
the
same
fraud?
