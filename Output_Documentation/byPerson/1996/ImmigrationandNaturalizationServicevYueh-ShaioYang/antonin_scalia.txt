justice
antonin
scalia
but
currently,
do
i
understand
it
correct...
i
must
say,
i
was
quite
surprised
to
discover
this,
but
the
situation
is,
if
you
commit
entry
fraud
and
are
successful,
so
long
as
you
don't
commit
any
other
fraud,
you're
okay.
is
that
the
current
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
may
not
get
it,
but
you
won't
be
denied
it
simply
because
you
got
in
fraudulently.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
extraordinary,
myself.
no
matter
how
severe--
--i--
--i'm
sorry.
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
--policy
by
discretion
of
the
executive
is
that
anyone
who
commits
fraud
successfully
upon
entry
is
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
get
in
under
the
provision
of
the
law
that
says
a
spouse
can
get
in,
and
you
lie.
you
say
i'm
married
to
somebody.
you
are
in
fact
not
married
to
somebody.
so
long
as
you
persuade
the
officer
of
the
truth
of
that
lie,
it's
okay.
once
you're
in,
it's
all
right.
that's
the
policy
we
now
have
in
place.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
we
were
going
to
get
serious
about...
about
enforcing
our
borders,
and
i
was
really
quite
surprised
to
find
that
that's
the
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
save
anything.
the
attorney
general
can
continue
to
let
everybody
in
who's
lied
successfully,
and
there's
no
judicial
review.
it
may
make
it
worse.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
have
to
now
be
an
immediate
relative?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
suppose
they
lied
when
they
came
in
and
they
said
they
were
an
immediate
relative.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
to
be
one
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
regardless
of
the
history,
what
the
statute
does
is
give
the
attorney
general
discretion.
that's
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
limitation
doesn't
exist
right
now.
as
far
as
we
know
now,
and
this
is
what
i
got
from
the
brief,
all
entry
fraud
is
not
taken
into
account.
isn't
that
the
rule
as
it
now
exists?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
of
a
single
case
of
entry
fraud
that
has
been
taken
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say,
i
don't
understand
this
concept
of
preentry
fraud.
who
is
the
fraud
being
committed
on?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it's
only
being
committed
on
the
united
states
at
the
time
you
present
yourself
for
entry.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
surely
i
can
enter
into
a
sham
divorce
if
i
want,
and
until
such
time
as
i
applied
for
entry
to
the
united
states,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
her
wife's
entry
that
was
the
fraud.
it
wasn't
the--
--his
wife's.
i
mean,
it
was
the
wife's
entry
that
he
assisted
that
was
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hom,
could
you
help
me
with
the
statute
here?
i
have
trouble
reading
it.
it's
on
page
5a
and
6a
of
the
government's
brief,
and
the
crucial
provision,
the
subsection
(ii),
roman
(ii),
reads,
was
in
possession
of
an
immigrant
visa
or
equivalent
document
and
was
otherwise
admissible
to
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
such
entry
except
for
those
grounds
of
inadmissibility
specified
under
paragraphs
(5)(a)
and
(7)(a),
and
1182(a)
of
this
title,
which
were
a
direct
result
of
that
fraud
or
misrepresentation...
what
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
requires
an
antecedent,
and
i
scanned
this
statute
for
any
prior
reference
to
fraud
or
misrepresentation,
and
i
can't
find
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
it
should
read,
except
for
those
grounds
of
inadmissibility
specified
under
paragraphs
(5)(a)
and
(7)(a)
which
required
labor
certification.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
section
1182,
which
is
requirement
of
a
visa.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
for
those
grounds...
let's
see,
which
involved
fraud
or
misrepresentation
and
were
a
direct
result
thereof,
is
how
it
should
have
read.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
problem
is
the
word
that,
a
direct
result
of
that.
what
fraud
or
misrepresentation?
there's
no
fraud
or
misrepresentation
mentioned.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
those
would
also
apply
to
the
original
fraud
in
obtaining
entry
in
the
first
place,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
attorney
general
forgets
about
this
initial
fraud
as
the
policy
is,
he
doesn't
then
prosecute
it
criminally,
i
assume.
he
both
allows
the
application
under
this
provision
and
chooses
not
to
prosecute,
i
take
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent,
yueh-shaio
yang
and
his
wife,
hai-hsia
yang,
were
born
and
married
in
the
people’s
republic
of
china
and
subsequently
moved
to
taiwan.
in
order
to
gain
entry
to
the
united
states,
they
executed
the
following
scheme:
after
divorcing
respondent
in
taiwan,
hai-hsia,
traveled
to
the
united
states
in
1978
and
using
$60,000.00
provided
by
respondent,
obtained
a
fraudulent
birth
certificate
and
passport
in
the
name
of
mary
wang,
a
united
states
citizen.
respondent
then
remarried
hai-hsia
in
taiwan
under
her
false
identity
and
fraudulently
obtained
an
immigrant
visa
to
enter
the
united
states
as
the
spouse
of
a
united
states
citizen.
in
1982,
four
years
after
his
fraudulent
entry,
respondent
submitted
an
application
for
naturalization
which
fraudulently
stated
that
his
wife,
mary,
was
a
united
states
citizen
by
birth
and
that
respondent
had
been
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
in
1985,
while
the
respondent’s
naturalization
application
was
still
pending,
respondent
and
his
wife
obtained
another
divorce
in
order
to
permit
her
to
obtain
a
visa
under
her
true
name,
as
the
relative
of
a
daughter
who
had
obtained
united
states
citizenship
by
then.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
ins,
ultimately
learned
of
the
respondents
unlawful
entry
and
in
1992
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
deported.
respondent
conceited
deportability
but
requested
a
waiver
of
deportation
under
section
1251(a)(1)(h)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
permits
the
attorney
general
to
grant
discretionary
waivers
to
relatives
of
the
united
states
citizens
and
permanent
resident
aliens.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
denied
the
discretionary
waiver
although
the
board
has
a
general
policy
of
not
taking
an
alien’s
entry
fraud
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
to
waive
deportation.
it
regarded
the
various
fraudulent
acts
here
as
going
beyond
the
mere
entry
fraud
in
1978.
the
ninth
circuit
granted
the
respondent’s
petition
for
review
and
remanded
to
the
board
for
a
reweighing
of
the
equities
without
consideration
of
respondent’s
participation
in
the
fraudulent
scheme,
all
of
which
it
said
were
inexplicably
intertwined
with
his
1978
entry
and
therefore
under
the
board’s
own
policy,
could
not
be
considered.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
the
waiver
of
deportation
statute
imposes
no
limitations
on
the
factors
that
the
attorney
general
or
her
delegates
may
consider
in
exercising
her
discretion
to
waive
deportation.
although
the
ins
has
a
policy
of
refusing
to
consider
entry
fraud,
that
policy
is
of
its
own
invention
and
maybe
interpreted
within
reason
as
it
chooses.
the
ins
has
not
acted
arbitrarily
here.
it
has
rationally
chosen
to
distinguish
aliens
such
as
respondent
who
engage
in
a
pattern
of
immigration
fraud
from
alien’s
who
commit
a
single
isolated
act
of
misrepresentation
at
the
time
of
entry.
thus,
the
decision
of
the
board
was
lawful
and
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
must
be
reversed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
