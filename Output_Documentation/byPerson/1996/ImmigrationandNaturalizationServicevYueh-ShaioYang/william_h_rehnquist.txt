chief

william

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-938,
immigration
&
naturalization
service
v.
yueh-shaio
yang.
ms.
brinkmann,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
under
the
statute,
the
attorney
general
would
have
been
perfectly
free
to
consider
that
fraud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
because
congress
has
given
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
waive
fraud,
certainly
you
don't
concede
that
the
attorney
general
couldn't
say,
i
have
the
power
but
i
decline
to
waive
any
kind
of
fraud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
it
that
in
those
kinds
of
cases...
why
does
the
bia
disregard
that
fraud?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
treat
like
cases
alike
and
say
we'll...
we
will
not
disregard
it
in
any
of
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
here,
i
take
it,
ms.
brinkmann,
is
that
although
the
attorney
general
has
exercised
her
discretion
in
this
manner
to
forgive
entry
fraud,
that
she
has
control
of
just
what
that
means,
and
it
shouldn't
be
expanded
by
the
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
a
fraudulent
application
for
citizenship
here
too,
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
was
improperly
considered
by
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
i
take
it
you
want
to
reserve--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
hom.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
matter
of...
you
say
part
of
your
argument
to
that
effect
is
based
on
statutory
construction.
where
in
the
statute
do
you
find
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--why
isn't
the
key
phrase,
"fraud
may,
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
be
waived?
"
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
talking
about
statutory
construction
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you...
that
isn't
at
all
clear
to
me.
i
mean,
why
isn't
the
otherwise...
just
a
threshold
requirement,
and
once
you
meet
that
threshold,
then
you
can
invoke
the
attorney
general's
discretion,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
how
it
should
be
exercised.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
fact
that
congress
has
imposed
additional
conditions
over
and
above
the
family
relationships
actually
limits
the
attorney
general's
discretion.
that
seems
rather
strange.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
1982
fraud
here,
the
citizenship?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
repeated
them
4
years
later,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he's
just
continuing
to
make
fraudulent
representations,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
you
know,
i
can
repeat
the
same
statements
to
defraud
people
time
after
time.
that
doesn't
mean
that
all
are
subsumed
under
the
first
one.
each
repetition
is
a
new
fraudulent
representation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
ins
didn't
interpret
it
this
way
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
i
mean,
this
was
not
the
attorney
general's
view.
this
was
the
view,
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
attorney
general
has
to
do
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why...
where
did
they
get
the
authority
to
do
that,
when
the
discretion
resides
in
the
attorney
general,
not
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
didn't
grant
the
waiver.
i
think--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it...
they
could
have
the
threshold,
and
then
the
attorney
general
may
grant
the
waiver.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely
the
attorney
general
can
look
at
a
fraud
that
was
committed
4
years
after
entry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
the
attorney
general
look
at
a
fraud
that
was
committed
4
years
after
entry?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
do
you
get
that
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
the
same
fraudulent
statement,
but
it's
repeated
4
years
later.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wasn't
to
obtain
entry,
it
was
to
obtain
citizenship,
so
it
isn't
the
same
purpose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
something
he
does
4
years
afterwards,
that
wouldn't
bear
on
his
admissibility,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
saying,
as
you've
said
before
during
your
argument,
that
he
can
repeat
the
same
fraud
unendingly
and
there
are
no
consequences
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
attorney
general
must
grant
a
waiver.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
repeating
the
fraud
is
not
sufficient.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
change
meant
absolutely
nothing,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hom.
ms.
brinkmann,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-938,
ins
versus
yang
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
