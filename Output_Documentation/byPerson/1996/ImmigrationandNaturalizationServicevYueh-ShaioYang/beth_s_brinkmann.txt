ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
respondent's
request
for
a
waiver
of
deportation
under
section
241(a)(1)(h)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
the
act
commits
that
decision
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
exercising
her
discretion
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general
properly
considered
numerous
frauds
committed
by
respondent,
including
his
fraudulent
application
for
naturalization,
fraudulent
marriages,
fraudulent
divorce,
and
his
participation
in
the
fraudulent
obtaining
of
documents
for
his
wife's
fraudulent
entry
into
the
country.
the
attorney
general
did
not,
again
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
consider
the
fraud
respondent
committed
at
entry.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
the
seventh
circuit
has
expressly
recognized
that.
in
rodriguez-barajas,
judge
easterbrook
explained
that
the
attorney
general's
under
no
compulsion
to
disregard
that
initial
fraud,
and
that
any
limitation
on
that
has
arisen
out
of
the
attorney
general's
exercise
of
her
discretion.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
aliens
that
are
in
the
pool
of
eligible
aliens
for
this
type
of
waiver
share
several
common
characteristics.
they
all
have
three
factors
weighing
in
their
favor.
they
have
to
be
the
relative...
the
parent,
son
or
daughter
or
spouse
of
a
citizen
or
a
permanent
resident
alien.
they
also
must
have
presented
themselves
for
entry.
they
have
to
have
a
validly,
facially
valid
document,
and
they
have
to
be
otherwise
admissible.
they
also
share
the
fact--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
they
also
share
the
fact
that
they
all
committed
entry
fraud.
now,
looking
at
that
pool
of
applicants,
the
attorney
general
has
to
decide
who
amongst
that
she
should
exercise
her
discretion
to
give
a
waiver
to,
and
our
submission
is
that
it's
certainly
proper
for
the
attorney
general
to
favor
a
person
who
has
been
law-abiding
since
their
initial
entry
over
someone
who's
perpetrated
a
series
of
frauds.
we
would
also
submit,
your
honor,
although
it
has
not
come
up
in
the
typical
kinds
of
cases
that
have
come
before
the
board,
if,
for
example,
the
entry
fraud
was
intertwined
with
violence,
for
example,
we
certainly
think
the
attorney
general
in
her
discretion
could
take
that
into
account.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'd
look
to
the...
for
example,
the
court
in
the
rios-pineda
case,
when
the
court
was
looking
at
the
attorney
general's
authority
whether
or
not
to
grant
suspension
of
deportation
there,
i
think
characterizes
looking
to
the
nature
and
severity
of
the
factor,
so
i
would
think
that
that
would
clearly
be
appropriate
for
the
attorney
general
to
take
into
account.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
particularly
in
the
immigration
context
there
may
be
other
matters
of
foreign
affairs
or
international
relations
that
at
a
particular
point
in
time
the
attorney
general
would
choose
not
to
exercise
her
discretion
in
favor
of
waivers
under
this
provision.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
if
i
under--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
your
honor,
it's
clarifying
some
confusion
that
had
existed
under
their
previous
provision,
and
it
makes
clear
that
if
the
attorney
general
grants
a
waiver
of
deportation
under
this
provision,
that
waiver
of
deportation
waived
the
grounds
of
inadmissibility
for
the
fraud
and
also
for
inadmissibility
grounds
that
directly
result
from
that,
that
being
a
fraudulent
visa
or
fraudulent
labor
certification.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
in
fact--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
can
give
an
example
to
explain
it.
there
is
some
fraud
at
entry
that
doesn't
involve
fraudulent
documents
or
labor
certificates.
misrepresenting
your
marital
status,
perhaps,
in
an
interview.
some
people
obtain
their
visas
based
on
false
information
at
a
consulate
beforehand,
and
then
when
they
arrive
at
the
port
of
entry,
they
continue
to
stand
by
what's
in
that
visa,
but
perhaps
they've
been
unmarried...
they've
been
divorced
or
married
in
the
meantime,
so
they
would
be
committing
a
fraud
at
entry,
but
that
would
not
necessarily
relate
to
any
fraudulent
document.
if
they
had
an
independently
based
fraudulent
document,
that
could
be
a
ground
of
inadmissibility,
and
it
would
not
be
waived
because
it
would
not
directly
result
from
their
fraud,
and
i
think
what
the
statute
was
trying
to
get
at
was
that
any
of
the
grounds
of
inadmissibility
at
the
time
of
entry
that
directly
result
from
the
entry
fraud
are
also
waived.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no.
we
would
simply
say
that
describes
what
the
effect
of
the
grant
of
the
waiver
is.
the
attorney
general
grants
a
waiver,
and
it
specifies
that
it
waives
deportation
based
on
those
grounds.
that's
what
the
effect
of
a
241(a)(1)(h)
waiver--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
effect
of
it,
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
we
would
submit
that
as
in
my
previous
discussion
of
how
the
attorney
general
could
take
into
account
the
nature
and
severity
of
the
initial
fraud,
the
attorney
general
certainly
also
as
matter
of
discretion
could
take
into
account
the
nature
and
severity
of
the
other
grounds
of
inadmissibility
on
the
fraudulent
labor
certificate
or
visa,
the
means
by
which
that
was
procured.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke
if
i--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
right,
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
one
of
the
ironies
of
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case
is,
it
really
gives
the
type
of
open-ended
immunity
to
aliens
who
enter
by
fraud.
by
requiring
that
later
frauds
be
considered
as
a
part
of
or
an
extension
of
the
entry
fraud,
those
aliens
are
put
at
an
advantage
over
an
alien
who
enters
lawfully
and
then
commits
later
fraud
which
is
not
forgiven.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
believe
that
if
that
were
based
on
a
reasonable
exercise
of
her
discretion--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
would
be.
i
guess
in
my
initial
answer
i
was
trying
to
think
of
an
example
in
which
that
might
be
the
case,
and
i
come
back
to
the
example
of
perhaps
there
are
other
immigration
interests
and
other
quotas
that
are
so...
so
important,
and
as
a
matter
of
policy--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--you
mean
waivers
under
241(a)(1)(h)?
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
would
be.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
and
it's
a
reasonable
approach.
i
think
the
board
has
found
that
the
cases
that
have
come
before
it,
that
entry
fraud
does
seem
to
be
of
a
common
ilk,
and
has
decided
to
treat
like
cases
alike
in
that
regard,
and
need
not
look
at
that
initial
factor.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
if
a
case
arose
in
which
a
different
type
of
entry
fraud
was
involved
involving
violence,
for
example,
we
believe
that
would
be
certainly
something
which
the
board
may
very
well--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
to
the
extent
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
to
the
extent
that
there
is
judicial
review
for
abuse
of
discretion
the
board
would
be
well
advised
to
provide
a
reason.
i
have
to
hasten...
have
to...
have
to
be
quick
to
add
at
this
point,
your
honor,
at
this
point
it's
somewhat
of
a
limited
query,
because
the
new
statute
that
was
passed
a
week
and
a
half
ago
eliminates
judicial
review
of
the
attorney
general's
exercise
of
discretion
under
this
provision.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
you're
eligible
for
a
waiver.
that
doesn't
mean
you
get
it,
your
honor.
at
that
point
you
can
apply
to
the
attorney
general.
you
have
to
be
a
relative--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
will...
when
the
attorney
general,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
the
immigration
judge
exercise
their
discretion,
the
practice
at
this
point
is
not
to
take
into
account
the
initial
entry
fraud.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
your
honors,
when
i've
looked
through
all
the
cases,
the
typical
case
that
has
come
forward
involves
very
similar
types
of
fraud,
mainly
people
misrepresenting
the
fact
they've
been
married,
or
been
divorced,
family
relations.
there
have
not
been
cases
which
involve
incidences
of
violence,
for
example,
and--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
to
an
extent,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
taken
as
a
matter
of
treating
like
cases
alike,
and
that
that's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--right,
and
that's
what
the
alien's
coming
forward
to,
as
asking
for
forgiveness
for,
as
the
board
has
characterized
it.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
initially,
this
was
enacted
as
section
7
of
the
immigration
act
in
1957,
and
it
was
responding
to
entry
by...
immigrants
were
fleeing
repression
in
totalitarian
regimes,
and
had
made
misrepresentations
in
order
to
avoid
repression,
and
that's
when
the
provision
was
first
enacted,
added
to
the
statute.
then
it
was
somewhat
modified
in
1961.
in
between
1961
and
1981,
that's
when
all
the
trouble
and
confusion
started
occurring,
and
that's
what
prompted
congress
in
1981,
or
the
proposals
pending
in
congress,
to
eliminate
it
altogether
because
it
had
caused
such
confusion.
for
example,
persons
who
entered
by
an
innocent
misrepresentation
some
courts
had
held
were
not
eligible
for
the
waiver,
whereas
aliens
who
had
entered
through
fraudulent
misrepresentations
were.
that's
something
that
the
1981
statute...
amendment
corrected.
it
also,
of
course,
made
it
discretionary.
it
also
made
it
clear,
for
example,
that
it
was
not
going
to
waive
deportation
for
aliens
who
entered
without
inspection.
now--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
wouldn't
say
it's
okay,
your
honor,
but
it's
enough
like
all
of
the
other
cases
that
have
come
before
the
board
that
it's
a
wash,
and
that
the
board
look,
and
the
immigration
judges
look
at
the
other
factors
that
underlie
the
interest
in
the
stat...
this
provision--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--right.
well,
it
dates
back
to
1978,
your
honor.
there's
a
similar
provision
for
waiver
of
exclusion
grounds,
and
that's
when
the
commissioner
of
ins
first
articulated
this.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
i
have
to
say
i
think
that
in
light
of
the
statute
that
was
recently
passed,
that
your
honor...
certainly
it's
a
situation
i
think
now
where
congress
has
eliminated
this
provision
from
judicial
review,
and
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
would
hasten
to
add,
your
honor,
i
mean,
this
waiver
of
deportation
does
apply
to
a
limited
pool
of
people.
it
applies
to
people
who
are
immediate
relatives
of
u.s.
citizens,
or
permanent
resident
aliens,
and
the
main
thrust
behind
this
provision
was
for
family
unification,
as
i
initially
pointed
out
to
justice
ginsburg,
in
'57,
it
had
to
do
with
the
nature
of
countries
that
aliens
were
fleeing,
but
the
real
interest--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
they
have
to
be
one.
that's
a
statutory
eligibility--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--at
the
time
of
the
application
for
the
waiver
and
the
grant
of
the
waiver,
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
was
really
the
interest
underlying,
so
although
i
think
at
first
blush
it
may
sound
frivolous
to
permit
people
who
have
lied
or
misrepresented,
i
think
that
congress
really
envisioned
an
overriding
interest
in
the
unification
of
families.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
don't
believe
that
it
is
compelled
by
that,
your
honor,
no.
we
think
that
to
the
extent
the
ninth
circuit
authority
can
be
read
that
way,
they're
clearly
wrong.
we
agree
with
judge
easterbrook's
opinion
in
the
seventh
circuit,
which
states
that
their
statute
imposes
no
compulsion
on
the
attorney
general
to
disregard
that
initial
fraud.
that
simply
is
one
of
the
eligibility
requirements.
that's
one
of
the
factors
i
described
earlier
that
all
the
aliens
in
the
applicant
pool
have
in
common.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
i
think
it
actually
derives
from
the
history
before
the
agency
itself,
your
honor.
as
i
explained,
it
actually
piggybacks
on
an
interpretation
of
waiver
for
exclusion
under
section
212(i)
in
1978.
the
commissioner
of
the
ins
set
forth
this
policy
and
that's
what
eventually
was
incorporated
into
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
of
the
deportation
waiver.
when
that
first
statement
was
made
about
the
exclusion
waiver,
the
deportation
waiver
was
not
yet
discretionary.
it
was
mandatory.
the
exclusion
waiver
has
always
been
discretionary,
so
once
the
deportation
waiver
became
discretionary
in
1981,
and
the
attorney
general
came
to
start
interpreting
that,
she
looked
back
to
the
interpretation
that
had
been
given
to
the
exclusion
waiver
that
was
always
discretionary.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
looking
at
the
text
of
this
statute
following
the
1981
amendment,
congress
was
clear
to
write
that
the
deportation
may
be
waived
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
particularly
against
the
backdrop
of
the
history
in
1981,
where
there
had
been
proposals
to
eliminate
it
altogether.
also,
i
would
add,
congress
did
set
out
the
statutory
eligibility
requirements
we've
already
discussed,
and
did
not
include
any
other
even
factors
to
consider
in
many
provisions
of
the
immigration
nationality
act.
for
example,
congress
has
told
the
attorney
general
specifically
to
consider
hardship
to
family
members
and
all
that.
this
waiver
provision
contains
none
of
that,
and
we
think
that
bolsters
our
interpretation
that
it's
left
to
the
sole
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it's
difficult
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor,
because
the
cases
all
have
very
comparable
types
of
fraud.
there
just
haven't
been--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
that
would
be
within...
it
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
her
delegates,
to
decide.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
case
simply
has
not
come
up,
your
honor,
and
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
it
would
come
within
that,
because
i
think
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--they
may
not
be,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
that's
true,
and
i
think
the
attorney
general
would
be
free
to
change
her
policy
and
explain
that
in
the
future
any
entry
frauds
that
have
to
do
with
violence
certainly
are
going
to
be
weighed
much
more
severely,
in
fact--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--frankly,
your
honor,
we
also
don't
know
the
other
way,
because
the
case
just
has
not
arisen,
and
the
attorney
general
has
not
been
presented
with
that
situation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
certainly
not
in
the
reported
cases
i've
seen.
it
might
be,
your
honor,
because
in
situations
like
that,
the
alien
is
more
than
likely
going
to
be
not
otherwise
admissible,
will
be
inadmissible
on
other
grounds.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
these
are
certainly
i
think
a
totality
of
circumstances
when
the
attorney
general
exercises
her
discretion,
and
any
type
of
misdeed--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
misunderstood.
i
wanted
to
say
that
the...
some
misdeed
beforehand
can
certainly
be
considered.
i
just
did
not
want
to
say
that
that
was
dispositive
and
meant
that
a
waiver
could
not
be
granted.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
on
the
united--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--states,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
respondent
collaborated
in
obtaining
fraudulent
birth
certificates
and
passports
for
his
wife,
and
the
reason
that
the
divorce
and
remarriage
under
an
assumed
name
that
he
also
participated
in
was
to
commit
a
fraud
in
the
united
states
of
america
as
his
wife
coming
in
under
the
fraud
of
being
a
u.s.
citizen.
if
he
had
never
come
to
this
country--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
true,
and
he--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
i
also
wanted
to
point
out
that
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
this
view
and
admitted
that
the
naturalization
fraud,
for
example,
its
fraudulent
application
could
be
weighed,
and--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i'm
sorry,
that's
what
i
meant,
your
honor.
i
misspoke.
yes,
in
1982.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
actually
do
have
some
statistics
from
the...
from
fiscal
year
'95,
your
honor.
i've
been
informed
by...
this
is
from
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review.
these
were
decisions
on...
they
classified
them
as
241(f)
waivers,
but
it's
now
at
241
(a)(1)(h),
and
last
year
there
were
a
total
of
30...
this
was
for
immigration
judge
rulings,
37
waivers
with
a
grant
rate
of
approximately
84
percent.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
there
are
two
points
i'd
like
to
make.
one
goes
to
the
separation
of
these
frauds.
it's
clear
these
are
separate
frauds
because
they're
false
statements
made
for...
to
obtain
different
types
of
benefits,
certainly
for
naturalization.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
just
wanted
to
respond
to
justice
ginsburg's
concern
about
the
possible
criminal
prosecution.
it's
clear
that...
well,
depending
on
the
actual
facts
that
haven't
been
fully
investigated,
that
they
would
have
to
be
for
a
criminal
prosecution.
there
are
at
least
three
provisions
in
title
18
that
could
give
rise
to
criminal
prosecution.
1001
for
false
statements
to
a
u.s.
agency,
also
1015
having
to
do
with
fraud
concerning
naturalization,
and
then
1028
has
to
do
with
fraud
related
to
identification
documents,
and
depending
on
the
scope
of
respondent's
participation
in
the
purchase
of
the
fraudulent
passport
and
birth
certificate,
that
could
also
apply.
and
in
sentencing,
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
your...
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
there's
certainly
factors
that
can
be
taken
into
account
by
the
attorney
general.
it's
not
that
the
attorney
general
has
to
prosecute
and
imprison
people
rather
than
deporting
them.
certainly
if
they
can
be
taken
into
account,
for
example,
in
sentencing
simply
uncharged
counts
can
also
be
taken
into
account
under
this
waiver
provision.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
can't
speak
to
that,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
all
instances.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
had
to
do
with
the
textual
question
about
otherwise
admissible.
the...
that
term
goes
to
other
categories
of
people
that
are
set
forth
in
section
212
in
1182
as
it's
codified,
of
grounds
of
inadmissibility,
excludability.
that
has
to
do
with
categories
that
are
related
to
health,
to
criminal
history,
stow-aways,
smugglers,
national
security
reasons,
those
are
all
reasons
that
statutorily
an
alien
could
be
inadmissible,
and
that
is
what
gives
meaning
to
those
words,
otherwise
admissible,
in
the
statute.
thank
you.
your
honor.
