well,
you
think,
then,
that
the
statute
places
no
outer
limits
whatever
on
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general?
if
the
attorney
general
took
the
position
that
the
fact
of
a
fraudulent
entry
by
the
alien
is
a
factor
weighing
against
waiver,
then
nobody
would
be
entitled
to
a
waiver
any
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that
condition
exists
in
every
one
of
these
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
for
the
fraud.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
take
into
account
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
fraudulent
entry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
the
mere
fact
that
there
had
been
a
fraudulent
entry,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
any
event,
the
bia
has
adopted
a
different
standard,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
unless
that
standard
is
changed,
i
assume
the
government
would
abide
by
the
standard--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that's
been
adopted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
