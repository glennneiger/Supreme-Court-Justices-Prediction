mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
everybody
agrees
that
the
proceedings
by
which
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
death
violated
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
espinosa
v.
florida
so
holds.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
settled
principles
of
eighth
amendment
law
applied
to
the
florida
system
in
1992
in
espinosa
were
themselves
compelled
by
existing
precedent
in
1986.
that
the--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
another
way
of
phrasing
it.
that
the
espinosa
result
was
compelled
in
1986
can
be
explained
very
briefly,
in
30
seconds
or
less.
as
stringer
explains,
as
of
1985
an
unadorned
jury
instruction
on
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel
aggravating
factor
was
unconstitutional.
an
uncorrected
jury
weighing
of
such
a
factor
required
resentencing.
moreover,
jury
weighing
of
such
a
factor
could
be
corrected
or
cured
only
by
harmless
error
analysis
or
by
independent
reweighing
by
a
court
that
was
untainted
by
the
original
error.
espinosa
simply
applied
those
settled
principles
to
the
florida
sentencing
scheme.
to
elaborate
somewhat
on
these
points,
i
would
like
to
describe
in
a
bit
more
detail
why
the
result
in
espinosa
was
compelled
by
this
court's
decisions
in
proffitt,
godfrey,
and
stringer.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
does
factor
in,
if
i
can
explain
the
way
that
i
think
it
factors
in.
we
have
to
start
with
proffitt
v.
florida
in
1976,
and
in
fact
respondent
has
quoted
one
of
the
key
passages
from
proffitt
in
their
brief
at
page
13.
the
court
was
discussing
whether
the
florida
sentencing
scheme
was
basically
constitutional,
and
it
said
that
it
was
basically
constitutional
as
long
as
adequate
guidance
was
provided,
and
i'm
quoting
here,
to
those
charged
with
the
duty
of
recommending...
that
is,
the
jury...
or
imposing
death
sentences.
so
in
proffitt
this
court
recognized
that
the
jury
has
sentencing
authority
and
must
be
adequately
guided,
and
i
would
see
baldwin
as
more
or
less
a
reminder
that
the
florida
sentencing
scheme
does
work
in
that
way.
it's
different
from
alabama,
which
at
the
time
gave
no
real
consideration
to
what
the
jury
did.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
yes,
i
don't
think
that
baldwin...
baldwin
itself
decided
that
decision.
i
think
that's--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--no,
i...
well,
i
think
that
baldwin
itself
does
not
decide
the
issue.
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
way
to
decide...
because
baldwin
was
not
looking
at
the
florida
scheme.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
the
way
to
decide
the
issue
is
to
look
at
how
the
florida
sentencing
scheme
actually
works,
applying
this
court's
settled
principles,
and
if
you
look
at
the
way
that
the
florida
sentencing
scheme
works,
you
have
to
start
with
the
florida
supreme
court's
1975
decision
in
tedder,
and
respondent
virtually
ignores
tedder
in
their
brief
because
that's
the
only
way
that
you
can
really
seriously
argue
that
the
florida
jury
does
not
have
any
sentencing
authority.
proffitt
says
that
the
jury
does
have
sentencing
authority,
that
it
has
to
be
guided,
and
that's
exactly
what
this
court
picked
up
on
in
espinosa.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
i
think
that
stringer
answers
the
question
about
what
significance
the
trial
court's
actions
have.
stringer
says
that
as
of
1985,
in
order
to
cure
weighing
error
before
a
jury,
it's
necessary
to
either
have
harmless
error
review
or
independent
reweighing.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
it
was
the
jury
that
sentenced,
yes,
and
because
the
florida
jury
has
sentencing
authority,
the
same
result
applies
in
florida.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes,
it
is.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
that's
true,
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes,
i
do
read
it
in
that
fashion.
in
fact,
it
refers
to
sentencing
authorities
in
the
plural,
and
two
or
three
times
it
talks
about
adequate
guidance,
adequate
direction--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--i
think
that
it's
clear
from
proffitt
that
the
sentencing
authority
is
divided.
certainly
the
judge
ultimately
imposes
the
sentence.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
i
think
that's
correct,
and
certainly
nothing
had
changed
in
the
law
in
the
intervening
period,
and
i
think
it
was
obvious
to
this
court
in
espinosa
that
the
florida
sentencing
scheme
in
fact
gives
sentencing
authority
to
the
jury.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
exactly.
that's
what
florida
law
requires,
and
that's
whether
the
jury's
recommendation
is
life
or
death.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i...
first
it's
very
difficult
to
determine
exactly
what
the
trial
judge
found
when
he
said
the
facts
speak
for
themselves,
but
even
if
it's
assumed
that
the
trial
judge
was
finding
that
the
facts
fit
within
the
dixon
limiting
construction
in
florida,
which
i
don't
think
can
be
assumed,
but
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that,
merely
a
finding
by
the
judge
that
the
facts...
that
he
believes
the
facts
fit
within
the
aggravating
circumstance
doesn't
mean
that
the
jury
necessarily
would
have.
it's
certainly
not
a
finding
of
harmless
error,
because
he
doesn't
recognize
that
there
was
any
error,
and
it's
also
not
any
kind
of
independent
reweighing,
which
is
what
stringer
would
require,
because
the
judge
in
his
weighing
process
must
give
great
weight
to
what
the
jury
did,
and
what
the
jury
did
was
tainted
by
the
invalid
instruction,
so
it's
not
possible
for
the
trial
court
in
florida
to
cure
the
error
because
the
trial
court
has
to
weigh
the
error.
you
can't
cure
the
error
by
weighing
it.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
no,
your
honor,
not
without
determining
the
effect
of
the
error
upon
the
jury,
because
the
jury
may
not
view
the
facts
in
the
same
light.
they
may
not
believe
that
the
facts
are
unnecessarily
tortuous.
unless
you
go
to
that
step
and
say
that
the
facts
are...
that
the
jury
necessarily
would
have,
or
by
some
standard
would
have
found
that...
the
case
unnecessarily
tortuous,
then
you're
not
applying
harmless
error
analysis,
and--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--yes,
that's
right,
and
furthermore,
in
the
florida
system
the
florida
supreme
court's
review,
both
what
the
trial
court
does
is
virtually
controlled
by
the
jury's
recommendation.
so
is
the
florida
supreme
court's
review,
because
if
a
death
sentence
is
imposed
after
a
jury
recommendation
of
death,
the
florida
supreme
court
does
a
normal
form
of
deferential
appellate
review
to
see
if
the
trial
court's
findings
are
supported
by
the
evidence.
if
a
death
sentence
is
imposed
after
a
jury
recommendation
of
life,
the
florida
supreme
court
will
affirm
only
if
virtually
no
reasonable
person
could
differ
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
sentence.
so
that
many,
many
times
the
florida
supreme
court
reverses
the
trial
court's
imposition
of
a
death
sentence
after
a
jury
recommendation
of
life
when
the
trial
court
did
not
make
any
error.
the
trial
court
did
not
err
in
any
of
its
findings,
but
the
florida
supreme
court
nevertheless
reverses
and
imposes
life
because
of
the
jury's
life
recommendation.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
it's
not
dispositive
for
several
reasons.
first,
in
the
initial
round
of
post
conviction
proceedings
there
was
what
the
district
court
found
was
a
merits
ruling
on
this
claim,
and
so
this
was
a
second
review
after
remand
from
the
eleventh
circuit.
now,
whether
that
was...
whether
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
on
its
second
look,
whether
that
was
an
adequate
and
independent
state
bar,
is
a
very
complicated
issue
that's
tied
up
with
florida
rules
and
practice,
and
it's
not
been
ruled
on
by
any
court,
and
so
it's--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--no...
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it
hasn't...
whether
that
was
an
adequate
and
independent
state
bar
has
not
been
ruled
on
by
any
federal
court
is
what
i
should
have
said.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
no.
there
was...
the
claim
was
previously
raised
in
the
3850
proceedings,
and
in
those
proceedings
there
was
what
the
district
court
found
amounted
to
a
merits
ruling,
but--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--it
came...
yes.
it
came
after
the
case
had
gone
to
federal
habeas
proceedings,
proceeded
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
eleventh
circuit
then
remanded
because
it
wanted
the
state's
views
on
the
merits
of
the
espinosa
claim.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
3850,
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
that
was
by...
it
was
by
the
trial
court,
and
it
was
not...
it
was
not
disturbed
by
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
on
appeal,
and--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--well,
it
was
raised
on
the
3850
appeal.
the
point--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--ordinarily
it
does,
but
there
were
several
cases
during
this
time
period
where
claims
were
raised
in
3850
proceedings.
it
happened
in
glock,
for
example,
also.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--that's
correct,
but
if
the
lower
court
has
ruled
on
the
merits
and
the
appellate
court
does
not
disturb
that,
then
under
ylst
this
court
will
look
back
to
the
original
ruling
and
say
that's
a
merits--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--no,
your
honor.
the
court...
the
appellate
court
has
to
say
that
it's
barred
in
the
proceedings
in
the
case
that
we're
talking
about,
not
a...
a
general
rule
that
will
apply
a
procedural
bar
doesn't
have
any
effect
unless
it's
actually
applied
in
the
case.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
no.
the
procedural
bar
goes
away,
though,
if
the
state
courts
rule
on
the
merits.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
that
it's
a
very
complex
issue,
the
procedural
bar
here.
it
hasn't
been
ruled
on...
the
adequacy
hasn't
been
ruled
on
by
any
federal
court.
it's
really
not
included
in
the
question
presented,
but
even...
and
even
if
the
court
thinks
that
the
ruling
was
an
adequate--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--pardon
me?
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
the
teague
issue?
the
teague
issue
is--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--yes.
i
don't--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--yes.
the
claim
was
raised
in
the
3850
state--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--post
conviction
proceeding.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
the
claim
that
the
jury
instructions
were
unduly
vague
and
unconstitutional.
it
was
denied
on
the
merits
by
the
state
trial
court.
it
was
appealed
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
pass
on
it.
we
went
to
federal
habeas.
the
federal
district
court--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
the
federal
district
court
said
that
all
of
the
claims
were
ruled...
were
denied
on
the
merits
in
state
court,
and
therefore
it
reached
the
merits.
the
eleventh
circuit--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--yes--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--no
procedural
bar,
and
if
any
procedural
bar
had
been
applied
it
wouldn't
have
been
adequate
and
independent.
the
eleventh
circuit
then
remanded
the
case
back
to
state
court,
where
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
there
was
a
bar.
the
case
returned
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
eleventh
circuit
ruled
only
on
teague.
so
our
argument
is
that
there
was
no
regularly
applied
bar,
that
the
bar...
or
that
the
bar
went
away
when
the
state
courts
ruled
on
the
merits
in
the
first
instance.
you
can't
go
back
after
the
fact.
the
state's
bar
may
be
nothing
more
than
applying
a
rule
that
we're
not
going
to
consider
the
merits
in
a
successive
proceeding.
and
furthermore,
even
if
there
is...
even
if
the
court
thinks
that
there's
an
adequate
and
independent
bar,
there's
also
a
cause
in
prejudice
argument,
because
if
we
win
on
teague,
then
it's
clear
that
this
law
was
dictated
as
of
the
time
of
the
direct
appeal,
and
so
competent
counsel
should
have
raised
it.
the
eleventh
circuit
hasn't
ruled
on
any
of
this.
the
eleventh
circuit
is
closer
to
state
law
and
state
practice
than
this
court
is,
and
the
appropriate
disposition
would
be
to
remand
to
the
eleventh
circuit
to
let
it
figure
out
the
procedural
bar
issues
as
well
as
any
other
issues
remaining
after
this
court's
disposition.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
post
trial.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes.
it
was--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--right.
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
raised...
these
proceedings
were
under
death
warrant.
it
was
raised...
in
a
recognized
and
sandtioned
practice
in
florida
it
was
raised
by
filing
a
motion
for
stay
of
execution
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
attaching
all
of
the
claims
that
were
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
saying,
these
are
the
claims,
please
give
us
a
stay.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
your
honor,
i
have
no
idea
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes.
yes,
although
no
longer
in
florida,
but
yes,
there
are
probably
quite
a
few
cases
in
which
one
of
the
unduly
vague
instructions
on
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
was
given.
there...
whether
they
would
all
have
to
be
overturned
would
depend
on
a
number
of
things.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes.
if
there
are
no
further--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--is
there
a
particular
point
in
there
that
concerns--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--well,
your
honor,
that
contention
is
completely
antithetical
to
stringer
v.
black.
stringer
was
a
case
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
would
meet...
was...
would
fall
within
the
definition
of
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel,
it
was
an
aggravated
case,
and
this
court
in
stringer
said
that
as
of
1985,
it
was
compelled
that
the
failure
to
do
harmless
error
analysis
or
reweighing
meant
that
the
error
had
not
been--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--stringer
was
decided
in
1992,
but
it
says--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--but--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--i
believe
it
was
six,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
i
think
that...
yes,
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
amicus
brief
is
that
stringer
is
wrongly
decided,
because
stringer
says
that
the
result
was
compelled
as
of
1985.
so
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
i'd
like
to
briefly
address
the
procedural
bar
issue.
there's
two
important
points
about
what
happened
in
the
trial
court
in
the
3850
proceedings.
the
claim
that
was
raised
there
was
a
maynard
claim
that
challenged
the
vagueness
of
the
jury
instructions
as
well
as
the
florida
supreme
court's
review.
furthermore,
the
trial
court
denied
the
state's
motion
to
dismiss,
which
was
based
on
procedural
grounds,
so
the
clear
implication
of
what
the
trial
court
did
is
that
it
was
ruling
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
additional.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
right,
but
when
a
state
court
rules
on
the
merits...
the
3850
proceedings
are
after
the
trial.
when
a
state
court
rules
on
the
merits
in
any
proceeding,
that
does
away
with
the
procedural
bar.
they...
even
though
the
court
perhaps
could
have
applied
a
procedural
bar.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
we
think
the
appropriate
disposition
is
to
remand
after
ruling
in
our
favor
on
the
teague
issue.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
i
would
read
sochar
and
the
cases
cited
in
sochar,
because
there
are
numerous
kinds
of
jury
error
that
the
florida
supreme
court
has
reviewed
in
death
penalty
cases...
jury
instruction
error,
improper
evidence,
improper
argument.
in
none
of
those
cases
has
the
court
said,
oh,
well,
the
jury
has...
there
was
error
in
front
of
the
jury,
but
the
judge
did
it,
okay,
so
we
don't
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
jury.
they've
always
said,
look
to
see
whether
the
error
affected
the
jury,
and
that's
exactly
what
should
be
done
in
this
case,
and
that
shows
that
it's
not
just
a
pure
judge
case--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--yes,
and
a
second
opportunity,
and
then
the
question
is
whether
that's
adequate,
independent,
and
whether
there's
cause
and
prejudice
for
any
default.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
