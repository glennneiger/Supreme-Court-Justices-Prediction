justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
really
like
to
hear
your
explanation
in
sort
of
an
uninterrupted
fashion
if
i
could,
because
it's
a
rather
difficult
issue.
would
you
start
over
on
why
you
don't
think
the
procedural
bar
requires
us
to
dismiss
the...
to
rule
against
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
also
not
rule
on
the
procedural
bar
issue
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
it
also...
and
therefore
there
is
no
procedural
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
just
to
be
sure...
did
the
state
in
its
opposition
to
your
petition
for
certiorari
argue
procedural
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did.
okay.
counsel,
how
many
other
cases
are
there
like
this
petitioner's
case,
lambrix,
in
florida
that
would
have
to
be
overturned
if
you
are
correct
on
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
also
raised
in
the
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was
ruled
on
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
correct
that
it
could
be
a
procedural
bar
but
still...
i
mean,
at
least
theoretically
not
be
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
unlikely,
i
understand,
but
at
least
it's
theoretically
possible--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
the
grounds
it's
not
consistently
applied,
or
they
waived
it
by
addressing
the
merits
later,
or
something
like
that.
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
suppose
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
rule
on
it,
if
it's
this
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
know
more
about
florida
law
than
we
do.
that
much
is
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
the
teague
issue
you'd
probably
be
happier
with
that
disposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
ms.
dittmar,
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
sometimes
you
put
things
in
neat
categories,
either
a
judge
state--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
a
jury
state
and
so
forth,
and
we
use
those
labels,
but
is
it
not
correct
that
as
a
matter
of
florida
law
the
verdict
of
the
jury
is
a
significant
part
of
the
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
will
have
an
impact
presumptively
on
what
the
judge
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore
we
should
assume
that
if
the
jury
had
come
in
with
a
life
recommendation
here,
if
it...
presumably
a
properly
instructed
jury
might
have
done
so,
that
would
have
an
impact
on
the
judge,
some
impact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
fact
the
judge,
as
a
matter
of
florida
law,
would
have
had
a
duty
to
pay
attention
to
what
the
jury
had
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
understand,
but
he
doesn't
do
it
as
though
there
were
no
jury
recommendation
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
merits?
part
of
your
submission,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
scope
of
the
hac
factor
was
fairly...
had
already
been
narrowed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
the
time
of
this
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
one
question
i'm
not
clear
on
on
that,
why,
then,
did
the
judge
give
this
instruction?
why
didn't
he
give
the
instruction
that
you
say
he
clearly
should
have
given
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
say
his
instruction
was
adequate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
mean
the
instruction
to
the
jury.
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
your
opponent
that
that
was
a
valid
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
well,
was
it
also
invalid
under
godfrey?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
in
other
words
that
if
the
facts
of
the
case
would
have
been
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel,
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
the
jury...
how
the
jury
was
instructed.
