justice
david
h.
souter
you...
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
the
sequence
that
you
want
to
follow,
but
are
you
going
to
address
also
baldwin
in
alabama,
because
baldwin
held
in
'85,
i
think--
--five,
yes.
--that
there
was
a
question
about
just
how
intense
the
reweighing
had
to
be
if
that
were
to
supersede
a
jury
error,
and
i
would
have
supposed
that
that
would
be
factored
into
the
question
of
just
how
clearly
anticipatable
espinosa
was.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may...
you
know,
that
might
be
the
better
view,
but
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
one
could
reasonably
read
baldwin
as
saying
that
it's
not
clear
whether
the
subsequent
act
of
the
sentencing
judge
in
the
florida
scheme
constituted
an
adequate
reweighing
even
on
the
assumption...
which,
of
course,
we
never
really
know
under
the
florida
scheme...
even
on
the
assumption
that
that
factor
was
found
by
the
jury
and
was
one
of
the
bases
for
the
jury's
recommendation.
couldn't
it
reasonably
have
been
argued
that
baldwin
had
left
that
question
open?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
didn't
baldwin
signal
that
there
was
a
real
issue
to
this
effect,
and
that
issue,
at
least
so
far
as
the
particular
florida
scheme
was
concerned,
did
not
get
resolved
until...
or
at
least
resolved
in
part
until
espinosa
came
along?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you've
got
to
wrestle
with
here
under
teague
is
whether,
assuming
we
were
correct,
and
i
happen
to
think
we
were
insofar
as
evaluating
the
significance
of
the
jury's
function,
you
still
have
to
wrestle
with
the
question
whether
the
subsequent
act
of
the
judge,
who
is
presumed
to
know
the
proffitt
standard,
in
effect
adequately
supersedes
what
the
jury
had
done,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
that
was
the
difficult
question.
and
one
reason
why
that
was
a
question
upon
which
people
could
reasonably
disagree
was
that
baldwin
had
said
we're
not
telling
you
yet
just
what
kind
of
subsequent
act
or
how
intense
or
de
novo
a
subsequent
reweighing
will
be
required,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
was
the
sticking
point
under
teague.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
i
may
ask
you
this:
the
first
even
that
you
recounted
was
that
the
vagueness
was
raised
in
the
trial
court,
i
take
it
post
trial,
or
pre-trial?
justice
david
h.
souter
post
trial,
all
right,
and
then
you
said,
it
was
appealed
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
when
you...
was
the
case
appealed
with
that
issue
in
it,
when
you
say
it
was
appealed?
the
florida
supreme
court.
excuse
me,
the
florida
supreme
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
being
the
vagueness
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
specifically
including
this
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
many
members
of
the
court,
by
the
way...
in
answering
justice
breyer's
question,
how
many
members
of
the
court
concurred
in
the
stringer
holding?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your...
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
and
your
response
to
justice
stevens
is
to
say
that
if
there
is
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
proper
construction,
the
error
was
harmless,
but
we've
rejected
that.
we
have
said
very
clearly
that
harmless
error
is
not
sufficiency
of
evidence.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
it's
still
not
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
standard.
one
still
looks
to...
in
effect
to
the
extent
of
the
damage,
whether
one
looks
at
it
under
the
brecht
standard
or
a
more...
the
more
demanding
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right--
--but
you
don't
stop
there,
right?
