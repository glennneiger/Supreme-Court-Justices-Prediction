cary
michael
lambrix
v.
harry
k.

mr.
lawry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
another
way
of
appraising
it
is
the
way
we
phrased
it
in
the
butler
case,
isn't
it,
mr.
lawry,
that
could
a
reasonable
jurist
have
decided
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
mississippi
it
was
the
jury
that
sentenced,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
sentencing
authority
is
divided
in
florida,
is
it
not,
between
the
jury
and
the
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
mississippi
it
wasn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.

we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
relief
under
espinosa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
cases
that
were
tried
before
espinosa
was
decided?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
dare
say
there
are
more
than
a
dozen
case
in
florida
of
people
on
death
row
who
were
tried
before
1992,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
