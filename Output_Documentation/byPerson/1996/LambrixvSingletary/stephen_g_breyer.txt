justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
like
to
say
anything
about
the
amicus
brief's
arguments?
i
thought
they
were
pretty
good...
a
pretty
good
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
thought
that
their
basic
point
was
that
as
you
go
back
to
that
period
of
time,
the
late
eighties
and
so
forth,
it
wasn't
really
clear
the
extent
to
which
the
constitution
required
states
to
follow
what
one
would
have
thought
of
as
ordinary
legal
harmless
error
rules,
and
that
perhaps
all
that
was
happening
was
that
the
judge
was
being
told,
you
go
look
at
this
case
where
there's
a
hac
error,
and
you
make
up
your
own
mind.
we
have
to
have
a
judge
saying
that
this
case
is
the
kind
of
case
that
isn't
cruel
and
unusual,
heinous,
aggravated
or
cruel
on
the
ground
that
all
murders
are
like
that.
there
has
to
be
something
special
about
it.
but
as
long
as
the
judge
has
gone
and
looked
at
the
facts
and
said
there's
something
special
about
it,
that's
good
enough.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
stringer
decided
after
your
case
was
tried
or
not?
what's
the
timing
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
they'd
say
well,
stringer
wasn't
obvious,
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
i
just
knew
justice
souter
didn't.
[laughter]
i
think
he
thought
it
wasn't
obvious.
i
think
he
thought
clemons
wasn't
obvious.
that's...
and
i'm
just
trying
to
get
what
i
take
perhaps
wrongly
to
be
the
thrust
of
the
amicus
brief
to
see
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
advantage
to
you
as
a
prosecutor
from
that?
it's...
i
mean,
suppose
we
said
you're
right
on
the
procedural
bar.
there
are
other
cases
in
front
of
us,
i
think,
that
raise
this
same
espinosa
retroactivity
issue,
and
if
that
were
so
we'd
have
to
take
one
of
those,
if
there
are,
and
then
decide
the
same
issue
in
that
other
case,
and
all
we
would
have
done
with
the
two
cases
is
simply
decided
on
a
matter
unique
to
this
case
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
perfectly
capable
of
deciding
anyway.
i
mean,
so
how
do
you
benefit
from
that,
except
you
might
have
two
arguments
instead
of
one
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
respond
to...
i
have
another
question
which
i...
i
grant
you,
going
through
the...
this
is
very...
there's
the
godfrey,
and
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thirty-eight
different
case
names,
and
it's
sort
of
like
you
have
to
figure
out
the
professor
writes
ten
million
equations
on
the
board
and
then
he
answers,
well,
it
was
obvious.
i
mean,
the
question
is,
how
obvious
is
this?
so
in
thinking
about
that,
well,
basically
there
is
something
working
out
here
which
is
obvious
from,
like,
justinian
or
something,
that
if
you
have
a
jury
and
the
jury
decides
whether
a
person's
negligent
or
any
other
thing,
and
the
jury's
misinstructed,
you
get
a
new
trial,
unless
the
judge
says
that
it
was
harmless,
and
it
seems
as
if
all
these
cases
represent
a
working
out
of
that
principle
and
nothing
else.
and
the
only
thing
was,
it
wasn't
clear
for
a
while
whether
that
basic
hornbook
principle
is
applicable
through
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
states
in
death
penalty
cases,
and
by
the
late
eighties
it
was
clear
that
it
was,
and
even
if
it
wasn't
clear
that
it
was,
stringer
says
it
was
clear
that
it
was,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
therefore
it's
clear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
i
want
is
your
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
response
to
my
oversimplified
effort
to
make
it
clear?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
go
back
for
a
second
to
my
question,
because
looking
at
it
as
i
was
doing
you'd
say,
look,
all
that
godfrey
is,
is
it
tells
you
what
the
basic
error
is.
it's
like
making
a
misinstruction
about
negligence.
and
all
clemons
is,
it
tells
you,
treat
it
like
a
negligence
case.
it
gives
you
some
rules,
which
are
obvious
rules,
that
if
the
jury
makes
a
mistake
because
it
was
misinstructed
on
the
godfrey
issue,
like
negligence
or
anything,
then
of
course
you
have
to
have
a
new
trial,
unless
the
judge
can
say
for
one
of
three
reasons
that
it
made
no
difference.
and
all
that
espinosa
does
is
say,
florida,
which
is
a
little
bit
special,
is
really
like
a
state
where
the
jury
decides
it.
and
in
case
you
had
any
doubt,
stringer
makes
clear
this
very
basic
rule,
the
rule
from
justinian,
is
the
rule.
it
was
obvious,
says
stringer.
now,
that's
a
way.
i
know
it's
not
the
perfect
way,
and
i
know
it's
overlooking
a
lot
of
things,
but
if
i
were
to
look
at
the
case
that
way,
then
i
would
say,
yeah,
espinosa's
pretty
obvious,
and
this
whole
thing's
obvious
enough.
so
i
want
to
get
a
direct
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
that's
the
biggest
leap.
okay.
it's
at
that
point
that
then
you
look
to
espinosa's
quote
of
tedder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
the
question
is,
do
you
really
have
to
give
great
weight
to
the
jury,
and
if
we
read
tedder
and
went
back
and
read
the
earlier
florida
cases
and
thought,
gee,
it
looks
as
if
the
judge
really
is
giving
weight
to
the
jury
and
has
to,
then
we
would
think
this
is
pretty
much
like
a
negligence
case,
and
everybody
in
florida
should
have
thought
that
it
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
what
would
we
look
at
to
see
the
contrary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
part
about
espinosa
which
opposing
counsel
said
was
the
least
obvious
was
the
part
about
what
florida
state
law
is
really
like.
that
is,
is
the
role
of
judge-jury
there
really
like
a
judge-jury
in
a
negligence
case
or
some
other,
or
does
the
judge
really
make
a
pretty
independent
decision?
now,
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
read
on
that,
just
tedder?
