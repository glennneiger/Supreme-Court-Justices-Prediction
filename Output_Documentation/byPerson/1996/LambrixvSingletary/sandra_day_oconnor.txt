justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
espinosa
was
a
per
curiam
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
lends,
i
suppose,
a
little
support
to
your
theory
that
this
court
didn't
think
there
was
some
wide
division
on
the
issue,
or
it
might
not
have
handled
it
as
a
per
curiam.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
florida
law
require
the
sentencing
judge
to
place
great
weight
on
the
recommendation
of
the
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
was
ruled
on
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
many?
aren't
you
involved
in
public
defender's
work,
generally?
no?
yes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
whether
there's
a
procedural
bar,
perhaps?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
would
have
to
decide
this
issue
of
florida
law
here
to
conclude
there
is
a
procedural
bar,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
the
eleventh
circuit
hasn't
addressed
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
how
many
florida
convictions
or
sentences
would
have
to
be
set
aside
if
we
were
to
agree
with
the
petitioner
on
the
merits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
indicates
maybe
the
procedural
bar
might
be
the
best
thing
for
this
court
to
consider
first--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
a
preliminary
matter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
of
course
we
might
have--
--at
least
it's
our
stated
practice,
i
assume
you
would
acknowledge
from
prior
decisions
and
the
rules
and
the
text
writers
on
this
subject,
that
at
least
the
court
attempts
not
to
break
a
lot
of
new
ground
on
a
per
curiam.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
a
question
of
florida
law,
i
take
it,
requires
interpretation
of
what
the
florida
law
is
in
that
regard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
eleventh
circuit
is
more
familiar
with
that
than
we.
