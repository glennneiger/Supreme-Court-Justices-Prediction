justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
how
you
read...
you
read
proffitt
to
say
that
the
jury
is
the
sentencer
as
well?
is
that
my
interpretation
of
your
argument
thus
far?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
three
or
four
times
it
says
the
trial
judge
is
the
sentencing
authority,
and
so
forth.
i
guess
we
can
quarrel
over
the
reading
of
it.
i
certainly
don't
think
it's
clearly
to
the
effect
that
you
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
the
basic
difference
between
the
florida
system
and
the
georgia
system
is
that
in
florida
the
sentence
is
determined
by
the
trial
judge
rather
than
by
the
jury,
and
there
are
like
phrases...
there
are
like
phrases
throughout
the
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
had
heard
that
point
in
soklar.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
one
explanation
for
the
per
curiam
is
that
the
court
had
heard
the
arguments
on
it
in
soklar.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
merits
ruling
in
the
state
system
in
the...
i
forget
the
number
that
you...
38
something,
the
collateral
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that
by
an
intermediate
appellate
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
argument
is
that
that's
an
implied
affirmance,
or
validation
of
the
trial
court's
merits
ruling
even
though
it
hasn't
been
raised
on
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
florida
required
that
it
be
raised
on
direct
review
and
that
that's
the
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
even
in
that
proceeding
the
florida
supreme
court
didn't
pass
on
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
raised
it
there,
though?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
that
square
with--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
told
us
that
it
was
specifically
included
in
the
grounds
that
were
presented
in
the
collateral...
in
the
appeal
from
the
denial
of
collateral
relief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
the
lower--
--how
many
people
on
florida's
death
row
now
were
tried
before
espinosa?
do
you
have
any
statistics
to
that
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
want
to
get
to
the
teague
issue
and
should,
but
one
more
question
on
the
procedural
bar...
one
more
question
from
me.
when
the
circuit
court
says
that
teague
is
a
threshold
issue,
do
they
do
this...
do
thy
say
this
in
the
context
where
a
procedural
bar
argument
is
presented?
do
they
say
it's
threshold
even
to
a
procedural
bar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
to
a
procedural
bar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
teague
issue,
it...
if...
is
the
reading
of
proffitt
dispositive
of
the
case?
if
we
disagree
with
petitioner's
counsel
and
say
proffitt
was
very,
very
clear
that
the
judge
is
the
sentencer,
is
that
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
procedural
bar
is
not
just
failure
to
raise
it
at
the
trial
level,
is
it?
it's
failure
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court,
which
brings
us
back
to
our
earlier
discussion.
