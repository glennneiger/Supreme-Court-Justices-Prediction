ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
fundamental
reasons
why
this
court
should
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case.
the
first
issue
is
the
eleventh
circuit's
conclusion
that
teague
v.
lane
bars
espinosa
review
in
a
federal
habeas
proceeding,
and
that
conclusion
is
correct.
the
second
reason
is
the
procedural
bar
that
exists,
and
i'd
like
to
start
by
addressing
the
procedural
bar.
first--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--that's
correct.
the
eleventh
circuit
obeyed
the
command
of
treating
retroactivity
as
a
threshold
issue
and
decided
the
case
solely
on
teague,
so
they
did
not
address
the
state's
procedural
bar
argument.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
yes,
sir.
it
was
raised
there
numerous
times,
including,
even
on
a
motion
for
rehearing.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
yes,
it
was.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
yes,
it
was.
the
district
court...
as
to
the
godfrey
claim
that
had
been
raised
back
in
the
district
court,
the
state
argued
at
that
time
that
there
was
a
procedural
bar
based
on
several
different
reasons.
one
of
the
reasons,
and
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix
on
pages
46
to
49
in
the
state's
response,
the
primary
reason
was
this
was
a
direct
appeal
issue
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
it
had
not
been
raised
in
mr.
lambrix's
direct
appeal.
the
next...
the
other
argument
put
forth
by
the
state
at
that
time
was
that
although
it
had
been
raised
in
the
motion
for
post
conviction
relief,
the
trial
judge
in
that
motion
did
not
decide
the
merits
of
that
issue,
and
furthermore,
when
it
went
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
have
that
particular
issue
before
it,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
from
the
appeal
of
the
post
conviction
motion
clearly
says
there
are
two
issues
before
this
court.
both
of
them
relate
to
the
defendant's
state
of
intoxication
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
so
that
specific
issue
was
not
addressed
in
the
post
conviction
appeal
as
well.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
what
the
district
court
found?
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
based
on
florida
procedure
is
how
the
district
court
reached
that
conclusion.
what
happened
is,
the
godfrey
claim
that
was
raised
in
post
conviction...
and
this
was
a
claim
that
the
florida
supreme
court
had
inconsistently
interpreted
this
aggravating
factor,
and
therefore
the
factor
was
invalid.
that
claim
was
raised
in
the
post
conviction
motion
for
the
first
time,
and
the
state
responded
at
that
time
that
it
was
a
direct
appeal
issue.
the
circuit
court
judge,
the
trial
judge
in
florida,
did
not
specifically
address
that
issue.
in
his
order
he
merely
concluded
that
mr.
lambrix
was
not
entitled
to
relief.
he
does
not
say,
based
on
the
merits,
or
based
on
the
procedural
law
in
florida.
he
just
says
his
conclusion
is
mr.
lambrix
is
not
entitled
to
relief.
that
is
what
the
federal
district
judge
in
the
habeas
proceeding
found
to
be
a
ruling
on
the
merits,
his
conclusion.
when
that
was
appealed
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
there
is
a
particular
statute...
i'm
sorry,
a
rule
of
procedure
in
florida
that
when
a
post
conviction
motion
is
determined
summarily
by
a
trial
judge
without
an
evidentiary
hearing,
that
what
is...
goes
to
the
florida
supreme
court
or
whatever
the
appellate
court
is,
is
simply
the
record
that
was
before
the
lower
court,
and
that
there
is
no
briefing
or
argument
in
that
appeal.
it's
basically
a
review
of
what
the
trial
judge
had
before
him.
if
there
is
an
evidentiary
hearing
held
on
the
post
conviction
motion,
it
is
treated
as
an
ordinary
appeal
where
the
parties
file
briefs
and
orally
argue
the
case,
and
then
the
court
decides
it.
because
there
had
been
no
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
post
conviction
motion,
the
petitioner
has
argued
to
the
federal
district
court
successfully
that
under
the
florida
rule
that
says
everything
goes
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
even
though
in
this
particular
case
there
were
briefs
filed
and
there
was
oral
argument
held,
that
under
the
rule,
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
record
and
not
just
what
was
argued
in
the
briefs
and
argued
to
the
court,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found
when
he
found
that
there
was
a
ruling
on
the
merits
by
the
trial
judge,
and
that
that
ruling
on
the
merits
was
undisturbed
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
therefore,
he
found
that
it
was
reviewed,
and
central
to
his
holding...
of
course,
this
is
prior
to
the
time
that
the
espinosa
claim
went
back
and
was
found
to
be
procedurally
barred
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
central
to
the
district
court
was
the
idea
that
no
state
court
had
ever
specifically
said
this
is
procedurally
barred.
he
was
looking
for
that
language
in
one
of
the
state
court
opinions
and
he
did
not
find
it.
based
on
the
lack
of
that
statement,
he
said
that
there
was
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
so
the
state
has
maintained
consistently
that
this
was
a
direct
appeal
issue
that
should
have
been
raised
in
the
direct
appeal
and
it
wasn't.
this
same
issue
in
the
sochar
case,
this
court
declined
to
address
it,
because
it
was
procedurally
barred
in
that
case,
and
that
was
a
direct
review
case,
so
you
really
can't
come
back
on
a
collateral
case
on
habeas
review
and
address
the
procedurally
barred
issue
that's
the
same
issue
that
you
didn't
address
earlier.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
i
think
it's
a
very
straightforward
issue,
though.
i
don't
think
it's
as
complicated
as--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--right,
but
the...
we
have
the
clear
statement
from
the
florida
supreme
court
applying
the
bar,
and
we
don't
have
any
state
court
decision
ever
even
addressing
the
federal
question
or
addressing
the
merits
of
it,
or
even
recognizing
or
acknowledging
that
this
issue
has
ever
been
raised.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
theoretically
that
argument
could
be
made.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
correct.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
theoretically,
but--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--that's
true,
but
i
don't
think
mr.
lambrix
can
cite
to
you
any
cases
where
the
florida
supreme
court
has
not
consistently
applied
the
procedural
bar
that
they
applied
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
they
can
find
any
cases
where
the
florida
supreme
court
has
not
applied
a
procedural
bar
when
the
argument
was
not
presented
in
the
appeal,
because
that
is--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--i
suppose--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--well,
i
think
they
were
just
satisfied
with
the
teague
ruling,
and
they
just
didn't
address
the
state's
procedural
bar
argument
at
all,
and
i
think
that
there
are
cases
that
say
the
threshold
issue
is
retroactivity,
and
i
think
they
felt
like
once
that
was
resolved
and
they
could
thoroughly
analyze
that
issue--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--well,
either
way
i'd
be
happy,
but
the--
[laughter]
i
think
the
teague
issue
is
standing
out
there.
it's
something
that
needs
to
be
decided.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
yes,
ma'am.
i
would
say
less
than
a
dozen
cases,
not
necessarily
set
aside
but
at
least
considered
in
the
habeas
proceeding.
most
of
the
cases
in
florida
where
this
has
come
up
have
either
been
decided
since
the
time
of
espinosa,
and
obviously
at
that
point
the
florida
supreme
court
was
well
aware
of
the
issue
and
they
had
consistently
applied
espinosa
to
the
cases
that
have
come
before
them.
it
really
only
affects
the
cases
prior
to
espinosa
that
had
already
gone
into
federal
court,
and
there
would
have
to
be
the
preservation
of
error
and,
in
fact,
the
florida
supreme
court,
if
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court,
an
issue,
and
argued
on
appeal,
the
florida
supreme
court
is
granting
collateral
relief
in
those
cases.
so
if
it
has
not
been
procedurally
barred,
even
though
the
conviction
may
be
final
in
florida,
they
can
still
get
relief
from
the
florida
supreme
court
without
having
to
turn
to
the
federal
court.
there
are--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--yes,
sir.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
right.
if
they
argued
to
the
trial
judge
that
the
instruction
was
incorrect,
and
also
argued
that
on
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
and
those
arguments
were
rejected
at
that
time
because
espinosa
had
not
been
decided,
then
the
florida
supreme
court
is
granting
relief
in
those
cases.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
in
this
case.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
i
think
the
procedural
bar
is
an
important
threshold
issue
in
this
case.
the--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--i
don't
have
any
statistics
to
that
effect.
i...
of
the
federal
habeas
proceedings
that
i'm
aware
of
that
are
now
going
on
in
the
state
of
florida,
i
would
say
there
are
less
than
a
dozen
cases
where
this
is
potentially
an
issue.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
certainly.
certainly
there
are
more
than
a
dozen.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
actually,
this
court
has
said
it's
a
threshold
issue.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
i
don't
believe
that
specific
circumstance
has
been
addressed.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
i
think
that
that
is
how
it
is,
but
the
cases...
i
think
the
cases
where
this
court
has
said
that
have
not
been
cases
where
there
was
a
procedural
bar
to
consider
or
to
decide
whether
a
procedural
bar
takes
priority
over
a
teague
issue.
i
think
that
fundamentally
the
procedural
bar
is
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
addressed
as
a
threshold
issue
by
any
federal
court.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
that
extraordinary.
in
gray
v.
netherland
this
court
found
a
procedural
bar
on
the
brady
claim,
despite
the
fact
that
the
circuit
court
in
gray
had
never
reached
the
procedural
argument
on
that
claim.
the
district
court
in
gray
had
found
a
procedural
bar
on
the
brady
claim.
the
circuit
court
did
not
address
it
at
all,
and
when
gray
came
up
to
this
court,
this
court
addressed
the
procedural
bar
that
applied
on
that
claim,
so
i
don't
think
it's
so
unique
that
it
can't
be
done,
and
i
certainly
don't
think
it's
something
that's
beyond
this
court's
ability
to
do.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
i
think
this
court
can
address
both
issues
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
you're
limited
to
only
addressing
one
issue.
the
eleventh
circuit
applied
the
teague
bar,
and
i
think
that
gives
the
court
reason
to
look
at
the
teague
issue
and
to
decide
the
teague
issue.
i
think
that
you
can
say
that
there
are
two
reasons
to
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
one
of
them
is
a
procedural
bar,
and
one
of
them
is
the
teague
issue.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
i
think
that
is...
a
great
deal
of
the
case
is
proffitt,
but
also
the
other
sentencing
opinions
out
of
florida
that
has
come
from
this
court,
including
spaziano,
where
you
were
looking
at
the
constitutionality
of
the
judge
imposing
a
death
sentence
when
the
judge
had
recommended
a
life
sentence.
and
in
spaziano
you
talk
about
how
that
jury
recommendation
is
only
advisory,
and
again
you
refer
to
florida
as
a
judge-sentencing
state,
and
even
up
through
the
time
of
the
walton
decision
in
arizona,
which
was
decided
the
same
year
that
espinosa
was
decided,
this
court
continuously
refers
to
florida
as
a
judge-sentencing
state.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
right.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
it
is
an
important
part
of
the
procedure.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
i
think
necessarily
a
life
recommendation
will
have
a
graver
impact
on
what
the
judge
does
than
a
death
recommendation.
the
florida
supreme
court
in
tedder
has
said,
you
have
to
look
at
a
life
recommendation
and
find
whether
or
not
it
was
a
reasonable...
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
to
that
recommendation.
in--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--i
think
it
would
have
had
some
impact
on
the
judge.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
the--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--right.
well,
as
a
matter
of
florida
law
the
judge
still
has
to
make
his
own
independent
determination.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
that's
correct.
he
has
to
take
into
account
the
jury
recommendation,
and
i
think
particularly
when
the
jury
is
recommending
something
that
differs
from
his
independent
analysis
of
the
situation,
he
has
to
consider
it.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
i
think
he
can--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--i
think
he
can
make
an
independent
determination
first.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
in
the
situation
where
the
jury
has
recommended
life.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
there
are
cases
in
florida
in
dicta
where
there's
been
a
death
recommendation
where
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
a
death
recommendation
is
also
entitled
to
the
same
deference.
however,
you
don't
have
the
same
situation.
if
the
judge...
if
the
jury
in
florida
recommends
a
death
sentence
and
the
judge
imposes
a
life
sentence,
then
a
life
sentence
is
it,
and
that
case
is
not
reviewed
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
right.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
but
what
was
clear--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--i
don't
think
it's
clear.
[laughter]
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
what
is
clear
is
that
there
is
eighth
amendment
error
if
the
jury
waives
an
invalid
factor,
and
under
the
cases
prior
to
espinosa,
the
validity
of
the
factor
turned
on
its
application
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
and
the
way
the
factor
had
been
interpreted
by
the
state
appellate
court
to
give
a
narrowing
definition
of
the
factor.
in
espinosa,
the
validity
of
the
factor
all
of
a
sudden
turned
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
jury
recommendation,
or
the
jury
instruction,
rather
than
how
the
factor
was
applied
and
whether
it
had
been
narrowed
through
appellate
court
decisions.
that
was
a
fundamental
change
new
to
espinosa.
that
did
not
come
from
godfrey,
or
maynard
or
stringer,
or
any
of
those
other
cases.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
i
think,
as
the
point
was
made
earlier,
there
had
been
briefing
on
the
issue
in
sochar
that
the
court
examined,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
fair
conclusion
to
draw
merely
from
a
summary...
the
fact
that
it
was
a
summary
opinion
in
espinosa
to
say
we
would
never
have
made
a
new
rule.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
fully--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--well,
you
may
have
more
of
an
opportunity
to
create
a
new
rule
in
a
summary
disposition
because
you
may
not
fully
understand
the
implications
of
the
decision.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
that's
true.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
i'm
not
personally
familiar
with
where
that's
stated,
but
i
would
certainly
defer
to
that
being
stated
somewhere.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
right.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
right.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
he...
i
believe
the
judge
did
apply
the
narrow
construction
from
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
clearly
support
the
narrow
construction,
and
it
was
found
by
the
trial
judge--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--his
construction,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
i
believe
that
it
was
invalid
under
espinosa.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
i
don't
think
so,
if
the
facts
of
the
case
supported
the
narrow
construction.
what
godfrey
said
was,
the
georgia
supreme
court...
in
finding
the
factor
to
apply
in
that
case,
the
georgia
supreme
court
was
applying
an
inconsistent
application
of
the
statute
because
the
facts
did
not
meet
the
narrow
construction
that
the
georgia
supreme
court--

--right.
ms.

and
i
think
under
this
court's
decision
in
cabana
v.
bullock,
when
you
said
a
case
which
you
had
to
determine
at
what
point
there
had
to
be
a
finding
of
enmund
under
a
felony
murder
situation
for
the
death
penalty
to
be
imposed,
you
said
that
finding
could
be
made
by
the
appellate
court.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
well,
that's
true,
but
i
think
you
have
to
look
at,
and
especially
in
a
habeas
case,
the
extent
to
which
the
error
could
have
injuriously
affected
the
defendant.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
that's
true,
but
i
think
before
you
get
to
the
harmlessness
you
have
to
get
to
the
fundamental
question
of
where
the
error
occurred.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
you
don't
stop
there.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
the
biggest
leap
in
that
analysis
is
when
you
say,
florida
is
like
a
jury
sentencing
situation.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
right.
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
except
that--
ms.
carol
m.
dittmar
--except
that
when
you
read
tedder,
i
don't
think
you're
limited
to
tedder
itself.
i
think
you
need
to
read
the
florida
supreme
court
decisions
that
interpret
tedder
and
that
say
what
they
meant
by
tedder,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
has
expressly
come
out
and
said
in
tedder
we
did
not
elevate
the
jury
to
be
a
cosentencer
in
florida.
that
was
never
our
intent.
the
judge
has
a
statutory
duty
to
do
an
independent,
de
novo
review
of
the
aggravating
and
the
mitigating
factors,
and
the
jury
recommendation
is
just
that,
an
advisory
recommendation,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
quite
strongly
in
cases
where
the
eleventh
circuit
had
found
a
caldwell
error,
a
violation
that
the
jury's
role
was
minimized
to
the
jury
based
on
florida's
standard
jury
instructions.
for
those
reasons,
we
would
ask
you
to
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion.
thank
you.
