justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lawry,
there's
also
an
issue
of
procedural
bar
in
this
case.
are
you
going
to
address
that
at
all?
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it
the
florida
supreme
court
held
in
this
litigation
specifically
that
lambrix
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
the
trial
court's
failure
to
include
his
special
instruction
on
his
direct
appeal,
and
consequently
lambrix's
espinosa
claim
is
procedurally
barred.
that's
the
last
word
of
the
florida
supreme
court
on
that
subject.
why
is
that
not
dispositive?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
find
it
hard
to
get
around
the
statement
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
that
the
objection
wasn't
raised
on
appeal,
and
there
is
a
procedural
bar.
that's
what
it
said,
and
you
say
there's
a
later
lower
court
opinion
in
the
state
which
contradicts
the
supreme
court
statement
that
there
was
a
procedural
bar?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
a
lower
florida
court.
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
ruling
came
after
that,
did
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
where
the
appellate
court
has
previously
said
before
the
lower
court
went
back
to
the
merits,
even
where
the
appellate
court
has
previously
said
this
claim
is
procedurally
barred?
i
mean,
that's
a
different
situation,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
procedural
bar
arises
from
the
original
trial.
if
that
is
procedurally
barred
as
a
result
of
what
was
done
at
the
original
trial,
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
different
later
proceedings
certainly
wouldn't
alter
the
judgment
of
whether
there's
a
procedural
bar
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
the
other
issue
is
complex?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
the
other
issue
you
were
talking
about
is
complex?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
the
merits
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
threshold
to
the
merits.
that's--
--i
would
think
so.
--what
i
understood
it
to
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
really
independent.
i
mean,
these
words
don't
make
any
sense.
he
makes
his
own
independent
determination,
but
he
has
to
take
into
account
the
jury's
determination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
disagrees
with
his
independent
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
that
won't
suffice.
he...
his
own
independent
determination
may
be
overcome
by
the
fact
that
the
jury's
determination
to
the
contrary
was
a
reasonable
one.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
well,
it
all...
it
says...
great
weight
is
the
quote
they
use,
that
he's...
in
page
23
of
your
opponent's
brief
it
says
that,
quoting
espinosa
quoting
tedder,
it
says
that
the
florida
law
is
that
the
judge
has
to
give
great
weight
to
the
jury's
recommendation,
whether
of
life
or
death,
which
are
counsel's
words.
now,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lawry,
can
i
come
back
to
your
response
to
justice
o'connor?
you
say
it's...
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
procedural
bar
is
a
question
of
state
law.
if
it
was
a
question
of
state
law
we
have
the
last
word
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
which
says
that
this
claim
is
procedurally
barred.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
an
issue
whether
that
assertion
by
the
florida
supreme
court
is
sufficient
to
establish
a
procedural
bar
for
federal
purposes,
given
that
a
lower
florida
court
had
reached
the
merits
in
this
other
fashion
and
so
forth,
but
it's
clear,
is
it
not,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
believes
this
claim
to
be
procedurally
barred,
as
a
matter
of
florida
law?
now,
you
know,
they
may
be
wrong
as
to
whether
they
are...
that
is
good
enough
to
create
a
federal
bar,
but
don't
we
have
the
word
of
the
florida
supreme
court?
