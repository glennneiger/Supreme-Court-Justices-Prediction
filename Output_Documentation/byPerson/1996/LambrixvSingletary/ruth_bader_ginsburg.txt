justice
ruth
bader

but
mr.
lawry,
you
also
said
that
harmless
error
plays
a
part
in
this,
and
this
trial
judge
did
say
that
the
facts
speak
for
themselves.
doesn't
that
indicate
that
he
reweighed
without
reference
to
the
jury
verdict?
isn't
that
a
signal
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
really
academic?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
he
said...
this
trial
judge
had
said,
now,
i
know
what
heinous,
atrocious
conduct
is,
and
i
find
that
that
standard
is
met
here,
these
facts
speak
for
themselves,
would
that
be...
is
that...
would
that
be
adequate
then
to
amount
to
harmless
error?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
it
be
harmless
only
if
the
judge
disassociated
himself
from
what
the
jury
did
and
said,
i'm
looking
at
this
de
novo
and
here's
how
i
come
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
address,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
should
be
an
opportunity
to
show,
though,
that,
if
there's
an
allegation
that
the
florida
court
has
not
consistently
applied,
although
they
could
have,
this
as
a
procedural
bar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
this
court
to
take
it
up
in
the
first
instance,
when
it
hasn't
been
taken
up
in
the
lower
federal
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
this
court
should
not
have
disposed
or
it
summarily
in
a
three-page
per
curiam
opinion,
because
isn't
it
this
court's
ordinary
practice
not
to
dispose
of
a
case
in
that
kind
of
summary
way
if
it's
doing
something
new?
isn't
it
the
general
practice
here
that
we
have
full
briefing
and
argument
if
we're
doing
something
that's
genuinely
new?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
say
never,
but
a
slight...
there's
a
tilt
in
that
direction
at
least
that
if
the
court
thinks
this
is
clear
enough
that
it
doesn't
have
to
set
the
case
down
for
argument,
doesn't
need
briefing
beyond
the
cert
petition
and
brief
in
opposition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
that's
a
good
reason
not
to
dispose
of
it
summarily
if
we
don't
fully
understand
the
implications.
