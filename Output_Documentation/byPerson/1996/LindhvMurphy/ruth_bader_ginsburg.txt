mr.
liebman,
those
erie
cases
are
consistent
within
that
context,
but
surely
not
everything
that
would
be
labeled
substantive
for
erie
is
substantive
for
other
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
liebman,
you've
explained
the
one
side
of
it,
what
would
be
subject
to
the
ordinary
rule
of
prospectivity.
can
you
describe
the
other
category,
these
processing
rules
that
you
say
that
kind
of
change
would
apply
to
the
case
wherever
it
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
liebman,
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
wellman,
on
that
point
i
am
confused.
i
thought
that
there's
a
big
difference
between
an
injunction,
which
is
indeed
prospective,
from
this
day
forward,
and
habeas,
which
says,
you
should
not
be
where
you
are.
it's,
i
thought,
backward-looking,
because
you
don't
give
a
person...
release
a
person
based
on
some
future
activity
but
you
say,
you
should
not
be
here
today,
you
should
not
have
been
there
yesterday.
there's
no
legal
authority
to
hold
you.
so
it
seems
to
me
habeas
is
backward-looking,
not
forward-looking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
landgraf
is
a
long
opinion,
and
suppose
the
member
of
congress
got
only
up
to
page
242,
where
it--
[laughter]
where
it
says,
but
while
the
constitutional
impediment
to
retroactive
civil
legislation,
constitutional
impediments
are
now
modest,
prospectivity
remains
the
appropriate
default
rule.
okay,
that's
what
the
member
of
congress
fastens
on,
prospectivity
remains
the
appropriate
default
rule,
period.
we
didn't
say
anything.
it's
prospective.
why
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
you're
saying
that
later
parts
of
the
opinion
take
this
back,
that
prospectivity
is
not
the
default
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
something
else
is
the
default
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose...
suppose
he
had
won.
suppose
lindh
had
won
in
the
district
court.
here
he
lost,
and
so
he
was
up
on
appeal,
but
in
line
with
justice
breyer's
question,
what
happens
when
he
wins
and
the
warden
is
appealing
and
it
gets
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
everything
else
is
the
same,
the
new
law
passes.
does
that...
well,
you
tell
me
what
happens.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you...
why
do
you
distinguish...
if
he
filed
his
thing
on
time
under
the
old
rules
but
not
if
he
won
under
the
old
rules?
you
would
allow
him
to
preserve
the
filing
time,
so
that's
one
thing
from
the
old
system,
but
you
would
not
allow
him
to
preserve
winning
on
the
merits.
how
do
you
put
one
in
one
category
and
the
other
in
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
his...
one
of
his
arguments.
it
isn't
engaged
directly
with
your
argument
about
what
is
the
default
rule.
let
me
ask
you
this.
it's
clear
that
congress
can
say
what
it
wants,
and
that's
what
the
court
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
is
when
the
congress
doesn't
speak.
the
object
of
landgraf
was
to
give
congress
a
default
rule
so
it
would
know
when
it
says
nothing
how
the
court
is
going
to
respond
to
that.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
making
the
rule
hard
to
apply,
maybe
we
were
not
successful
in
landgraf.
maybe
landgraf
needs
to
be
modified
so
that
congress
will
have...
it
will
know
what
this
court
will
do,
what
it
will
instruct
lower
courts
to
do
when
congress
is
silent.
