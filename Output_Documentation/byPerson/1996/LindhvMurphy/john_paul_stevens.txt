justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
something
you
said
a
minute
ago?
under
your
view,
if
the
court
of
appeals
2
days
before
the
enactment
of
this
statute
had
affirmed
a
judgment
in
favor
of
a
petitioner,
would
the
state
have
had
an
automatic
right
to
have
us
on
review
vacate
that
judgment
and
say,
try
it
under
the
new
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
under
your
view,
all
judgments
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
that
were
still
not
final
in
the
sense
that
our
opportunity
for
review
or
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
expired,
would
have
to
be
reopened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
assuming
that
the...
we
would
really
have
a
duty
to
do
it
under
your
view,
if
the
case
had
been
decided
under
the
wrong
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
normally
if
there's
a
clear
precedent
that
controls
the
disposition,
we
send
it
back
for
a
second
look
under
the
new
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
any
event-move
it
back
one
stage.
if
a
petitioner
had
prevailed
in
the
district
court,
it
is
clear
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
your
view
they
would
have
to
send
it
back
for
a
new
proceeding
under
the
new
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
to
be
sure
i
have
your
whole
view
on
it,
we
started
out
with
the
107(c),
which
says
the
effective
date
of
chapter
154
shall
be
on
and
after,
and
your
reading
of
the
statute
would
really
be
that
this
entire
statute
shall
apply
to
all
cases
pending.
what
is
your
view
of
why
congress
just
explicitly
described
154
and
didn't
mention
153?
what's
your
basic
theory
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
your
answer
to
his
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
your
view
the
filing
date
controls?
