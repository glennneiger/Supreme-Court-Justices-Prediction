justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
test--
--you
could
say...
i
mean,
arguably
that's
one
conclusion
you
could
draw
from
the
fact
that
congress
said
that.
the
other
conclusion
you
can
draw
is
that
congress
realized
that
if
it
didn't
say
that,
appeal
would
have
been
cut
off
automatically,
that
it
had
to
say
that
in
order
to
preserve
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
do
you
have
a
way
of
saying
in
a
sentence
or
two
what
your
standard
for
determining
which
procedures
are
determinative
of
the
change
of
consequence...
you
know,
the
language
from
landgraf?
what's
worrying
me
is
every
procedural
change,
every
rule
of
evidence,
any
change
anyone
can
think
of
in
the
court
system
is
going
to
change
the
result
in
respect
to
some
category
of
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
of
course,
that's
determinative
of
legal
consequence.
they
say,
don't
look
at
it
that
way.
look
at
actions
in
the
world.
does
it
change
the
consequence
of
actions
of
the
world
legally?
no.
look
at
remedies.
does
it
change
that,
whether
the
person
goes
to
prison
or
not
because
of
a
violation
of...
no.
then
look
at
procedures,
and
procedures
don't...
that's
the
kind
of
way
i
think
they
want
us
to
look
at
it.
now,
you're
saying,
no,
look
at
those
procedures.
some
procedural
changes
do
change
legal
consequences
attached
to
actions,
others
don't.
what's
your
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if,
in
fact,
there
were
two
levels
of
an
administrative
review,
including
three
levels
within
the
agency
and
two
in
court
later
on,
and
maybe
three,
and
congress
said,
i'm
going
to
take
away
one
level
of
review...
why
are
you
doing
it?
we
think
this
kind
of
individual
is
just
delaying
things
too
long.
then
you
would
say,
because
they
have
four
levels
of
review
instead
of
five,
that
that
then
fits
the
landgraf
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that's
why
they
change
four
levels
to
five.
it's
five
levels
in
a
social
security
case.
they
only
want
three,
and
they
think
too
many
social
security
claimants
are
getting
money,
so
they
change
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that,
then,
make
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they
determine
systematically
that
they...
i
mean...
do
you
see
what
i'm
saying?
it
could
happen.
if
it's
not
social
security--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
if
there's
an
administrative
procedure,
and
by
looking
at
it
you
see
that
this
procedural
change
was
designed
to
help
one
group
or
one
side
versus
the
other,
then
it's
substantive.
that
is
your
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
have
a
change
in
the
parole
evidence
rule
because
we
feel
that
defendants
in
contracts
cases
by
and
large
are
winning
too
often.
therefore
we
change
it
so
it's
easier
for
the
plaintiffs
to
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
does...
i
mean,
my
real...
the
real
thrust
of
my
question,
to
be
a
little
facetious
about
it,
is
if
all
the
rules
of
construction
and
cases
and
silences
and
everything
balance
out
exactly
equally,
should
we
presume
congress
intends
to
do
that
which
makes
more
sense,
you
see.
[laughter]
and
so
therefore...
therefore,
i'm
asking
you
really
about
what
makes
sense
in
terms
of
the
application,
and
what
i
wonder
is,
well,
i
can
understand
how
to
apply
a
rule
to
new
habeas
petitions.
even
i
can
figure
that
one
out.
if
it's
a
new
one
you
apply
it.
if
it's
an
old
one
you
don't.
and
what
i'm
worried
about,
and
wonder
about...
i
don't
have
a
view.
i
want
to
get
your
view.
what
i'm
worried
and
wonder
about
is
what
kind
of
a
mare's
nest...
what
kind
of
a
complexity
are
we
getting
into
if
we
try
to
apply
it
retro
or
post...
however
you
want
to
put
the
word,
if
you
try
to
apply
it
to
the
set
of
cases
that
have
already
been
filed
and
are
at
various
stages
of
proceeding.
for
example,
i
take
it
that
a
judge
who
is
about
to
decide
under
this
new
rule
would
at
least
have
to
give
the
habeas
petitioner
a
chance
to
go
back
and
reargue
and
possibly
introduce
new
witnesses,
wouldn't
he,
before
applying
a
new
standard?
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that's
worrying
me,
and
that's
why
i'd
appreciate
your
addressing
that
kind
of
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then,
suppose
the
petitioner
says,
well,
if
only
i'd
realized
that
would
happen,
i
would
have
introduced
three
new
witnesses
who...
and
i
would
have
made
seven
different
new
arguments.
does
he
get
a
chance
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
new
witnesses?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they're
going
to
say
immediately
is...
i
mean,
maybe
not
in
this
case,
but
the
petitioner
will
say,
but
i
didn't
argue
the
supreme
court
cases,
or
whatever
the
standard
is,
and
i
didn't
produce
the
witnesses
because
i
had
this
circuit
precedent
that
was
perfect
for
me,
so
i
want
another
hearing.
i
want
another
hearing
and
i
want
to
produce
10
more
witnesses.
does
he
not
get
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
theory
of
retroactivity
would
be
that
you
reverse
them
all
for
the
new
standard,
but
if
the
person
says
i
didn't
know
about
the
new
standard
and
would
have
conducted
my
hearing
differently
had
i
known
about
it,
he's
denied
relief?
