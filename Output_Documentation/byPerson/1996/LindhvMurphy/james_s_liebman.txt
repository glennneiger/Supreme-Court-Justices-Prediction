mr.
james
s.
liebman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
granted
review
of
a
single
issue,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
denied
aaron
lindh's
1992
habeas
petition
based
on
a
1996
amendment
to
28
u.s.c.
section
2254(d).
the
court
below
interpreted
that
amendment
to
require
it
to
leave
intact
state
court
decisions
believed
to
be
wrong
under
the
constitution
as
long
as
they
are
not
"gravely
wrong".
mr.
lindh
ardently
opposes
that
interpretation,
but
accept
it
here
in
addressing
the
different
issue
before
the
court.
i'll
make
two
points.
first,
because
the
statute's
express
delineation
of
the
pending
cases
to
which
new
habeas
provisions
shall
apply
omits
mr.
lindh's
pending
case,
the
statute
makes
itself
inapplicable
here,
and
thus
disposes
of
the
case
under
landgraf's
step
1,
and
also,
therefore,
under
its
clear
congressional
intent,
step
3.
second,
and
alternatively,
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
of
section
2254(d)
to
attach
a
new
legal
consequence,
the
denial
of
relief,
to
preenactment
events
that
previously
had
given
lindh
an
unconditional
right
to
relief
from
unconstitutional
custody
bars
section
2254(d)'s
application
under
landgraf's
step
2.
in
landgraf
in
1994,
the
court
repeatedly
urged
congress
to
exercise
responsibility
for
fundamental
policy
judgments
concerning
the
temporal
reach
of
statutes,
so
landgraf
held
that
where
congress'
intent
as
to
the
temporal
reach
is
clear,
its
statute-specific
policy
judgments
will
govern,
but
that
otherwise
the
courts
will
follow
the
timeless
and
universal
rule
against
applying
new
laws
to
have
retroactive
effects.
that
is,
against
attaching
to
preenactment
events
what
a
court
finds
to
be
a
new
legal
consequence.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
an
exception
under
step
2
per
se
for
jurisdictional
rules.
what
the
court
said
was
that
jurisdiction
oftentimes
is
the
kind
of
change
that
does
not
attach
new
legal
consequences
to
preenactment
events.
the
reason
is
that
in
all
of
the
court's
jurisdictional
retroactivity
cases
where
congress
didn't
specify
the
outcome
it
wanted,
there
was
an
alternative
forum
that
remained,
and
so
it
wasn't
a
question
of
whether
you've
got
to
enforce
your
rights.
it
was
simply
a
question
of
which
forum
you
would
be
allowed
to
enforce
your
rights
in.
this
case
is
very
different,
because
here
there
is
no
alternative
remedy.
there
is
no--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no.
the
rights
that
we're
talking
about,
your
honor,
are
the
statutory
rights
under
2241(c)(3).
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
having
become
unconditional
and
matured
before
the
statute
went
into
effect
was
a
statutory
cause
of
action
for
relief
upon
the
proof
of
two
statutory
elements
of
that
cause
of
action,
constitutional--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--there
are
three
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
principle
that
i
want
to
stand
on
is
that
there
is
no
remaining
effective
and
substantial
alternative.
that's
the
language
from
the
crane
v.
halo
case.
there
are
three
reasons,
therefore,
why
the
state
process
does
not
provide
an
alternative
and
significant
or
satisfactory
remedy.
the
first
one
is
that
the...
ever
since
this
court's
case
in
1886
in
ex
parte
royale
the
understanding
has
been
that
the
violation
is
the
leaving
intact,
the
emplacement
and
leaving
intact
of
custody
by
the
entire
state
judicial
system
as
a
whole.
and
so
you
cannot
make
what
is
part
of
the
violation
into
a
sufficient
remedy
for
the
violation,
because
it
is
as
if
in
the
landgraf
case
someone
were
to
say
to
mrs.
landgraf
that
because
she
had
tried
to
get
relief
from
her
employer
and
the
employer
had
thought
about
it
and
said
you
weren't
discriminated
against,
you
wouldn't
make
that
a
sufficient
remedy,
and
it's
the
same
thing
here.
part
of
the
violation
includes
the
entire
state
court
process
leading
to
incarceration.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
the
direct
appeal
process
provides
an
alternative
remedy,
it
is
a
remedy
by
certiorari
to
this
court
at
the
end
of
that
direct
review
process,
a
remedy
that
mr.
lindh
was
lulled
into
passing
up,
because
at
the
time
it
was
neither
his
last
nor
his
best
option
available
for
plenary
federal
review.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
let
me
give
the
third
reason,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it
speaks
directly
to
that.
in
the
plaut
v.
spendthrift
farm
case
in
1995,
the
court
spoke
about
a
number
of
congressional
statutes
that
take
away
the
res
judicata
defense
and
allow,
for
example,
soldiers
on
duty
to
reopen
litigation
that
was
concluded
against
them.
now,
let's
assume
that
congress
decided
to
change
that
statute
and
to
say,
no,
there
is
going
to
be
a
res
judicata
defense,
but
it's
only
going
to
be
a
res
judicata
defense
insofar
as
the
judgment
that
you're
challenging
was
gravely
wrong.
now,
under
this
court's
cases
it
is
very
clear
that
this
court
would
not
take
away
a
soldier's
existing
and
accrued
right
of
action
under
this
statute
as
it
existed
under
a
new
establishment
of
a
defense
that
was
established--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i'm
not
sure
it
makes
a
difference
whether
you
see
this
as
a
new
element
of
the
cause
of
action,
or
the
establishment
of
a
new
defense,
or
as
the
dramatic
changing
of
the
standard
of
review,
if
you
want
to
think
of
it
that
way.
now,
i
think
that
it
is
much
more
appropriate
to
look
at
the
post-enactment
statute
as
one
creating
a
new
standard
of
review,
but
it
does
set
up
a
chain
of
courts
and
tells...
in
2254(d)
it
says,
look
back
to
the
state
court
and
review
that
state
court
decision.
the
statute
never
before
had
said
that,
and
so
under
the
statute
as
it
previously
existed,
the
rights
that
were
given
and
accrued
under
the
previous
statute,
there
wasn't
a
standard
of
review
kind
of
approach.
but
even,
your
honor,
if
it
was
a
new
standard
of
review,
the
lower
court
cases
are
unanimous
on
the
question
that
the
imposition
of
a
new
standard
of
review
is
like
the
imposition
of
a--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
if
congress
said
specifically
we
want
this
to
apply
to
prior
judgments
that
had
been
entered
as
to
which
there
was
an
accrued
and
existing
right
to
appeal,
that
would
be
different,
but
if
congress
did
not
say
that,
if
congress
was
silent...
and
your
honor,
the
example
you
give--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no.
all
i
wanted--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no.
the
reason
i
appealed
to
plaut
was
plaut
happens
to
describe
a
series
of
statutes
that
the
court
might
be
familiar
with
by
remembering
plaut.
it's
just
a
series
of
statutes
that
had
removed
the
res
judicata
defense.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
appeal
to
plaut
as
a
precedent.
i
simply
meant
to
appeal
to
it
as
a
compendium
in
a
place
in
the
statue
of
a
number
of
statutes
of
a
certain
type
to
which
i
was
drawing
the
analogy.
but
let
me
be
very
clear
in
answer
to
justice
souter's
question.
in
this
court,
including
last
term
in
the
gasperini
case,
but
there's
a
whole
series
of
cases...
byrd
and
stoner...
this
court
has
confronted
the
question
of
whether
a
different
standard
of
review
applied
in
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts
has
erie
consequences.
is
it
substantive?
is
it
the
kind
of
thing
that
changes
the
legal...
the
law
that
applies
in
the
two
sets
of
courts?
and
in
those
cases
this
court
has
consistently
said,
using
what
is
in
effect
a
new
legal
consequences
analysis,
it's
saying,
are
there
new
legal
consequences
attached
to
the
forum
that
you
pick?
here
it's
the
new
legal
consequence
attached
to
a
temporal
kind
of
criteria,
but
the
analysis
there
makes
very
clear
that
standards
of
review
are
treated
as
substantive,
as
defining
the
substantive
rights,
and
as
changing
the
law.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
there's
a
one-to-one
relationship.
i'm
simply
trying
to
point
out
that
the
court
has
recognized,
including
in
the
gasperini
case,
that
you
get
new
law,
a
new
set
of
legal
outcomes.
in
a
sense,
what
you...
what
the
law
had
promised
you
in
the
state
courts,
if
it
instead
is
brought
in
the
federal
courts
you
get
something
different,
and
it
is
exactly
that
that
i'm
pointing...
that
i'm
referring
to.
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
point,
i
want
to
go
back
to
those
very
statutes
that
you
refer
to,
a
series
of
statutes
running
from
1875
to
1891,
the
everetts
act,
and
through
the
judges'
bill
in
1925,
and
up
through
1988.
in
all
of
those
statutes
where
congress
switched
this
court's
preexisting
appeal,
or
writ
of
error
jurisdiction
to
a
certiorari
jurisdiction,
in
each
one
of
those
it
both...
it
did
two
things.
first
of
all,
it
said
any
case
in
the
supreme
court
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
will
proceed
under
the
prior
statute.
secondly,
it
said
that
any
case
that
had
reached
a
final
judgment...
that
is,
in
which
there
was
an
accrued
and
existing
right
to
an
appeal
or
writ
of
error
at
the
time
the
new
statute
came
into
effect
would
be
given
a
long
period
of
time,
often
6,
7,
8
months,
to
get
into
the
supreme
court
under
the
old
law,
so
that
you'd
have
your
appeal
or
your
writ
of
error.
so
even
congress
seems
to
understand
that
even
if
it
is
a
chain
of
courts
connected
with
one
kind
of
review
versus
another,
that
if
you
had
an
accrued,
an
existing
right
to
the
review
because
you
had
a
final
judgment
against
you,
that
you
had--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--the
supreme
court,
this
court
itself
has
said
the
same
thing
in
those
cases
that
i
referred
to,
the
jurisdiction
cases.
there's
the
mccardle
case,
there's
crane
v.
halo.
in
those
cases
the
court
looked
to
see
whether
there
was
an
existing
efficient
and
substantial
alternative
remedy
that
remained
before
it
was
deemed
to
be
appropriate,
unless
congress
specified,
or
to
overcome
constitutional
problems,
as
in
mccardle,
to
cut
off
that
right
completely,
and
so--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
it
has
been
vindicated,
of
course.
it
was
vindicated
a
few
years
later
in
the
habeas
corpus
context
at
that
point
and
then,
of
course,
it
was
vindicated
again
in
a
sense,
or
at
least
as
a
way
of
avoiding
a
constitutional
issue
last
year
in
your--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--all
i--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no.
in
answer
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
in
mccardle
the...
they
got...
obviously,
there
congress
wanted
to
withdraw
the
jurisdiction,
but
there
still
was
a
constitutional
question
of
whether
you
could
do
it,
and
it
is
consistent
in
that
case
that
the
court
said,
well,
look,
there
is
an
alternative
remedy.
that
just
places
it
within,
as
well,
the
court's
retroactivity
cases,
where
there
isn't
a
constitutional
problem.
there's
simply
a
policy
problem
that
would
arise
from
applying
it
in
the
past,
and
what
the
court
did
in
those
cases
was
to
say,
it's
okay
to
withdraw
this
forum,
but
let's
make
sure
that
there
is
an
alternate
and
equally
efficient
remedy
that
is
available.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
your
honor--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--the
test,
your
honor,
is
when
a
congress
provides
a
standard
and
the
intent
of
that
standard
is
systematically
to
change
the
outcomes
in
a
series
of
cases
in
favor
of
one
of
the
litigants,
sets
of
litigants
to
that
action,
and
against--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no.
no,
your
honor.
if
i
conveyed
that
impression
i
didn't
mean
that
at
all.
it
has
to
do
with
congress'
effort
systematically
to
change
the
outcome
of
the
legal
rights
at
the
end
of
the
process.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
but
your
honor,
what
i--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--what
i
don't
understand
in
your
example
is,
either
side
can
benefit
from
another
appeal.
if
you
lost--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
no,
your
honor,
even
in
that
situation
what
i
would
look
to
is
the
four
corners
of
the
provision
itself,
and
to
see
if
within
the
four
corners
of
the
provision
itself
it
is
designed
to
realign--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
if
the
statute
were
to
say,
for
purposes
of
limiting
the
number
of
social
security
claimants
who
receive
relief,
yes,
that
would
be
it.
what
i
was
struggling
with
is,
a
rule
of
evidence
or
something
like
that,
you
never
quite
know
in
any
case
who
it's
going
to
help
and
who
it's
going
to
hurt.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
your
honor,
i
teach
evidence,
but
i
don't
have
to
teach
the
parole
evidence
rule
because
it's
a
substantive
rule
of
contracts,
and
so
yes,
that
would
be--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes.
that
would
be--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--there
are
two
aspects
to
this
under
the
landgraf
rule.
the
first
question
is
whether
any
right
has
matured
and
become
unconditional.
the
question
is
whether...
the
second
question
is
whether
that
has
happened
before
the
statute
went
into
effect.
now,
let's
take
injunctions.
injunctions,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
american
steel
foundries
case,
injunctions
are
decided
by
conditions
as
they
exist
on
the
ground
at
the
moment
the
court
ruled.
that's
what
american
steel
foundry
says.
so
if
a
case
is
filed
and
the
court's
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
grant
an
injunction,
and
in
the
middle
of
that,
but
before
the
injunction
is
ruled
on,
a
statute
changed...
changes,
that
becomes
another
one
of
the
factors
that
is
on
the
ground
at
the
time
the
court
rules,
and
it
would
be
considered
at
the
time
the
court
ruled,
because
there
was
at
that
point
no
accrued
and
unconditional
right
to
an
injunction
because
injunctions
are
always
up
in
the
air
and
unstable
and
unsettled
until
the
point
that
the
court
rules.
to
give
another
example,
the...
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
refers
to
the
change
in
1919
where
the
harmless
error
rule
was
adopted
by
statute.
well,
before
that
time,
this
court
had
applied
its
own
harmless
error
rule
consistent
with
the
one
put
in
the
statute
but
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
had
stopped
following
it
and
were
reversing
on
technical
error.
well,
at
that
point,
when
the
new
statute
was
passed
it
was
applied
immediately
in
those
cases,
the
reason
being
that
there
was
no
matured
and
unconditional
right
to
relief
on
technical
errors
until
the
supreme
court
had
passed
on
a
case
where
at
the
time
for
cert
had
passed,
because--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no,
your
honor,
actually
2264(b)
in
some
senses
is
our
strongest
point,
and
let
me
try
and
explain
why.
all
chapter
153
provisions
apply
in
all
habeas
cases,
all
state
prisoner
habeas
cases.
chapter
154
only
applies
in
capital
opt-in
cases.
so
if
the
chapter
153...
if
the
chapter
153
provisions
were
to
apply
to
pending
cases,
the
provision
you
read,
2464(b),
would
be
superfluous,
because
it
would
say,
in
a
set
of
cases
in
which
all
of
the
20...
in
all...
in
a
set
of
cases
in
which
all
of
the
chapter
153
provisions
apply,
apply
some
of
the
chapter
153
provisions.
there's
only
one--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--but...
but--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--but,
your
honor,
under
chapter
153
each
of
those
provisions
says
themselves
that
when
you
come
to
review
a
habeas
corpus
case
you...
if
it's
a
factual
question
you
look
at
2254(e).
if
it's
a
legal
question,
you
look
at
2254(d).
those
provisions
say
that
already.
so
what
2264(b),
your
honor,
is
doing,
is
saying
there
are
some
parts
of
225...
or
of
chapter
153--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--some
parts
that
we
want
to
apply
to
pending
cases.
everything
in
chapter
154
applies
to
pending
cases.
we
refer
by
reference
to
some
of
the
153
sections
in
chapter
154
and
therefore,
by
virtue
of
107(c),
we
make
those
applicable
to--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--pending
capital
cases.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
can
i
explain
why
that
is
an
irrational
reading
of
this
statute?
the
understanding
of
the
lower
court
is
that
this
is
designed
to
read
exhaustion
out
of
the
statute
by
leaving...
by
negative
implication
leaving
2254(b)
out.
however,
your
honor,
if
you
look
a
couple
of
pages
before
at
a
provision
called
2263(b)(2)...
it's
on
page
a-24...
under
that
provision
the
state
always
has
the--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--i'm
sorry.
it's
2263(b)(2).
it
is
right
smack
in
the
middle
of
page
a-24,
with
the
(2)
before
it.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
yes.
this
is
a
tolling
provision,
and
what
it
says
is,
there
shall
be
no
tolling
of
the
very
short
statute
of
limitations
for
second
or
successive
state
post
conviction
cases.
if
the
state
does
not
want
a
case
to
go
back
for
exhaustion,
it
simply
says,
you
go
back
and
exhaust.
we
assert
the
statute
of
limitations.
you'll
never
get
back
into
federal
court.
and
so
at
that
point
exhaustion
is
over
because
there's
no
effective
remedy.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
state
wants
exhaustion...
because
if
it
wants
exhaustion...
it
may
want
exhaustion
because
the
only
way
it's
going
to
get
the
hearing
to
be
held
in
state
court
instead
of
federal
court,
the
only
way
it's
going
to
get
a
set
of
fact-findings
in
state
court
that
will
bind
in
federal
court,
the
only
way
it's
going
to
get
section
2254(d)
to
apply,
because
2254(d)
does
not
apply
unless
there
was
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
in
the
state
court,
is
by
saying,
we'll
waive
the
statute
of
limitations,
insist
upon
exhaustion,
you
go
back
to
state
court,
and
we're
going
to
get
our
state
fact-findings
there
and
we're
going
to
get
the
benefit
of
2254(d).
the
theory
that
the
lower
court
used
and
that
the
state
asserts
is
a
theory
that
would
withdraw
from
states
the
right
to
get
state
court
fact-findings
that
are
binding
in
federal
court,
and
the
right
to
have
2254(d)
itself
apply
to
any
case
in
which
the
petitioner
shows
up
in
federal
court
with
the
newly
available
claim.
new
law,
new
facts,
and
the
petitioner
can
say,
i
never
have
to
go
back
to
state
court.
under
the
lower
court's
interpretation
here
and
the
state's
interpretation,
the
states
are
going
to
be
howling
when
they
find
out
their
payment,
their
repayment
for
having
paid
for
counsel
in
state
post
conviction
proceedings,
which
this
act
is
supposed
to
give
them
an
incentive
to
do,
is
the
withdrawal
of
their
capacity
to
force
these
cases
back
into
state
court
to
get
state
court
fact-findings,
have
state
hearings,
and
to
have
2254(d)
apply.
their
reward
for
providing
counsel
is
to
lose
those
defenses.
we
have
a
reading
that
is
not
irrational
in
that
way.
it
gives
the
states
the
choice.
if
you
don't
want
exhaustion,
assert
2263(b)(2).
if
you
do
want
exhaustion,
waive
the
statute
of
limitations
and
insist
upon
exhaustion.
that
means
that
2264(b)
is...
the
only
purpose
it
has
is
on
the
assumption
that
the
chapter
153
provisions
do
not
apply
to
pending
capital
locked-in
cases
on
their
own
bottom,
and
so
they
had
to
be
incorporated
by
reference.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
under
section
107(c),
if
the
court
reads
section
107(c),
the
same
negative
implication
that
says
if
your
case
was
pending,
153
does
not
apply
to
you,
that
same
implication
would
say
that
if
your
case
was
not
pending,
then...
but
you
file
it
immediately
after
the
statute
came
into
effect,
then
chapter
153
would
apply.
it
is--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--under
107(c),
because
the
words
of
the
statute
are
cases
pending.
under
the
retroactivity
analysis
i
do
not
say
that
the
filing
date
would
control.
what
controls
there
are
the
three
conditions
that
have
to
be
in
place
in
order
for
a
habeas
action
to
become
matured
and
unconditional.
there
has
to
be
exhaustion
of
state
remedies,
the
time
for
cert
has
to
have
passed,
or
the
supreme
court
has
denied
cert.
that's
2244(c),
which
says
if
the
supreme
court
acts
on
the
merits
habeas
is
over
and
done
with.
and
then
the
third
point
is,
you
have
to
be
in
custody.
custody
is
measured
under
the
carafas
case
at
the
point
of
filing,
so
in
some
cases
the
third
thing
that
will
happen
will
be
that
you're
in
custody
at
the
moment
the
court
says
to
look
to
see
if
you're
in
custody,
but
in
some
cases
exhaustion
occurs
after
you
file,
or
the
denial
of
cert
occurs
after
you
file
in
habeas.
it's
when
all
three
of
those
things
have
happened
that
you--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--if
it
is
designed
to
change
the
outcome
in
the
series
of
cases
such
that
you
can
say
the
law,
what
congress
wants
to
happen--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--your
honor,
i'd
need
to
see
the
exact
provision
in
the
exact
setting,
but
many,
many
cases,
the
actual
procedures
that
are
going
to
be
used,
they
could
benefit
one
person
in
this
case--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no,
well,
in
the
daubert
case
the
argument
was
the
jury
trial
is
always
better
for
the
criminal
defendant,
but
it's
sometimes
better
for
plaintiffs
in
civil
cases.
i
don't
think
you
can
predict,
and
that's
the...
the
question
is
whether
the
legislature
set
about
changing
the
arrangement
of
rights
by
trying
systematically
to
take
rights
away
from
the
outcome
of
the
suit,
not--
