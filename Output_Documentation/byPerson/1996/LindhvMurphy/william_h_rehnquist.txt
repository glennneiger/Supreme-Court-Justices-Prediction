william
h.
rehnquist
it
made
any
exception,
did
it
not,
for
jurisdictional
rules?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
reference
to
an
alternative
forum
in
mccardle
is
pretty
much
of
an
afterthought
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
provision
are
you
reading,
mr.
liebman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
the
date
on
which?
chief

william
h.

very
well,
mr.

from
you.

ms.
wellman,
there
are
microphones,
and
i
think
we
could
hear
you
even
if
you
didn't
speak
quite
as
loudly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
request
for
a
hearing,
then,
in
the
district
court
in
the
habeas
proceedings?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wellman.

william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
liebman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
mr.
liebman,
just
clarify
for
us,
suppose
the
petition
in
federal
habeas

not
been
filed,
what's
the
applicability
of
chapter
153?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
liebman.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
the
case
is
