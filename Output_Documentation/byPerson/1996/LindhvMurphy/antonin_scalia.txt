justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
isn't
a
new
standard
of
review.
i
mean,
that
alters...
that
alters
the
substantive
right.
this
is
just
the
elimination
of
review
that
used
to
be
available
and
is
not
now
available.
let's
say,
what
congress
did
when
it
eliminated
much
of
our
mandatory
jurisdiction
and
provided
for
recourse
to
this
court
only
by
certiorari,
it's
your
position,
i
gather,
that
congress
could
not
render
that
action
applicable
to
causes
of
action
that
arose
before
the
statute
was
passed?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now...
now,
wait.
you
abjure
any
reliance
on
constitutional
points,
then.
you
were
talking
about
plaut.
i
don't
see
the
relevance
of
plaut--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
you're
making
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
quite
different,
it
seems
to
me,
for
congress
to
require
the
courts
to
reexamine
something
that
they've
decided
on
the
one
hand,
and
that
was
plaut.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
congress
to
say
on
the
other
hand,
what's
been
decided
we're
going
to
leave
alone,
and
we
don't
want
any
more
appeals.
that's
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
latter
is
an
interference
with
the
judicial
function.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you...
i
thought
we
just
had
a
discussion
in
which
you
say
you're
not
relying
on
any
constitutional
problems
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
see
this
as
a
mccardle
case
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
liebman,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
four
corners
of
the
instrument
to
which
you're
appealing?
one
of
your
arguments,
indeed,
your
first
argument,
i
guess
the
one
you
rely
on
most,
is
that
since
chapter
154
in
its
last
provision
says
that
it
shall
apply
to
cases
pending
on
or
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act...
that's
on
a-31
of
the
appendix
to
your
blue
brief.
since
that
is
in
chapter
154,
the
implication
is
that
that
is
not
applicable
to
15...
chapter
153.
what
do
you
do,
then,
with
the
various
provisions
in
chapter
154
that
rely
on
amended
chapter
153?
for
example,
on
page
a-25
of
your
appendix,
in
section
2264(b),
it
says,
following
review,
subject
to
subsections
(a),
(d),
and
(e)
of
section
2254,
the
court
shall
rule
on
the
claims
properly
before
it,
but
according
to
you
there
will
not
be
review
subject
to
subsections
(a),
(d),
and
(e)
of
section
2254
because...
at
least
for
those
cases
pending
at
the
time,
because
those
provisions
will
not
apply
to
those
cases
pending
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
wait,
it
isn't
superfluous.
it's
a
temporal
provision.
it
just
makes
it
clear
that
these
things
have
to
be
done
first.
it
does
not
prescribe
that
they
be
done.
it
just
says,
following
review
subject
to
them,
the
court
shall
rule
on
the
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
question
of
when
it
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
very
subtle
way
to
do
it,
mr.
liebman.
and
the
seventh
circuit
disagreed
with
that
interpretation
of
2264(b).
judge
easterbrook
rejected
it,
and
so
does
your
opposing
counsel.
they
don't
agree
that
this
has
a
temporal
reference.
they
say,
this
is
a
which,
which
ones
in
2254?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
congress
know
about
the
landgraf
analysis?
i
mean,
was
the
landgraf
analysis
the
recitation
of
a
formula
that
we
had
used
for
a
century
or
so
and
congress
was
quite
familiar
with,
or
was
it
a
new
analysis?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wellman,
you
don't
concede
that
the
position
you're
arguing
for
is
retrospective
application,
do
you?
don't
you
take
the
position
that
your
position
is
prospective?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
crucial
issue
is,
prospective
from
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
retrospective
from
when.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
hard
question.
where
do
you
begin?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wellman,
i'd
like
to
be
clear
about
what
we're
discussing
currently
here.
am
i
wrong
that
what
we're
discussing
is
whether
congress
should
be
deemed
to
have
said
x
rather
than
y
because
if
it
said
x,
the
rule
which
we
have
developed
concerning
retroactivity
would
be
very
difficult
to
apply
and
create
a
whole
lot
of
complexity,
and
therefore
congress
should
be
deemed
to
have
said
x
rather
than
y?
is
that
the
argument--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you're
addressing?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
what
concerns
justice
breyer
is
that
if
we
accept
your
conclusion
on
this
matter
you're
going
to
have
to
decide
each
case
by
applying
to
it
the
landgraf
standards,
and
that's
very
complicated,
whereas
if
we
agree
with
your
opponent
in
this
case
it's
all
very
simple
and
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that
complexity.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wellman,
just
so
long...
so
i'm
clear
about
it,
is
it
your
position
that
chapter
153
does
apply
to
all
cases
pending
on
and
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
liebman,
your
position
as
i
understand
it
is
that
this
affects
prior
conduct
within
the
meaning
of
landgraf
if
the
procedural
rule,
although
on
its
surface
procedural,
benefits
one
side.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
do
about
the
jury
trial
example
mentioned
by
ms.
wellman?
surely
the
jury
trial,
the
ability
to
have
a
jury
trial
is
always
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
because
if
he
wants
it,
he
can
get
it,
and
if
he
doesn't
want
it,
he
doesn't
get
it.
now,
would
you
say
that
the
denial
of
a
jury
trial
must,
if
there's
no
other
indication
that
we
must
assume
that
it
does
not
apply
to,
what,
to
conduct
entered
into
before
the
provision
was
adopted?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
jury
trial
always
benefits
the
defendant,
and
i've
always
assumed
that
if
you
have
a...
you
know,
no
more
jury
trial
for
this
class
of
cases,
it
simply
applies
when
this
case
comes
up,
and
your
position
is
that
it
wouldn't.
