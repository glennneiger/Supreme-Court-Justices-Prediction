justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
liebman,
you
spoke
in
answering
the
chief
justice's
question
a
moment
ago
about
there
being
no
alternative
forum
here,
so
that
the
jurisdictional
analysis
was
inapposite.
why
wasn't
there
an
alternative
forum
simply
in
the
direct
method
of
appeal
in
the
first
instance?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
go
to
his
judgment,
and
it
may
have
been
a
perfectly
sensible
judgment
to
make
at
the
time,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
whether
there
is
an
alternative
to
the
particular
kind
of
review
sought,
which
i
assume
is
a
question
about
the
system
rather
than
about
his
particular
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
assuming
that
to
be
true,
you're
also
assuming
an
analogy
which
may
well
be
sound,
but
i
guess
it's
not
self-evidently
sound,
and
that
is
that
the
cause
of
action
that
you
would
be
speaking
of
in
your
example
is
the
same...
is
a
cause
of
action
in
the
same
sense
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
in
habeas,
and
habeas
is
kind
of
a
mongrelized
cause
of
action.
yes,
it
is
a
means
of
coming
into
court
under
a
specific
federal
statute,
but
it's
also
in
fact
a
means
of
review
for
error
as
an
alternative
to
another
means
of
review
for
error.
when
somebody
in
direct
appeal,
for
example,
takes
an
appeal,
we
don't
think
of
that
person
as
having
a
cause
of
action
to
appeal,
and
so
i
suppose
the
so-called
habeas
cause
of
action
is
in
that
sense
a
different
kind
of
cause
of
action
from
the
one
that
you're
referring
to
in
your
example,
and
i
guess
my
question
is,
why
as
a
matter
of
categorization
or
characterization
should
we
refer
to
the
habeas
remedy
as
involving
a
cause
of
action
in
that
classic
sense.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
is
reviewing...
i
mean,
in
order
to
grant
relief
it
is
reviewing
past
actions,
whereas
in
a
classic
injunctive
case
i
suppose
the
question
is,
at
the
present
time,
now,
is
the
defendant
doing
something
defendant
ought
not
to
do,
and
yet
in...
as
justice
ginsburg's
question
suggests,
in
the
habeas
case
it's
the...
the
consequence
is
entirely
a
consequence
of
something
that
happened
in
the
past.
the
person
was
either
properly
convicted
or
not
properly
convicted,
so
in
that
sense
it
is
backward-looking.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
at
some
point
at
your
convenience
go
into
a
question
that's
bothering
me?
if
congress
said
nothing
about
it,
now,
it
could
be
just
applying
to
all
new
habeas
petitions
or
ones
that
have
already
been
filed.
if
it's
the
first,
we
at
least
know
how
to
do
it.
if
it's
the
second,
i
was
wondering
about
the
very
large
number,
what
seemed
like
a
large
number
of
permutations
and
combinations
as
there
are
existing
habeas
petitions
at
dozens
of
different
stages.
there
are
first,
second,
third.
there
are
those
on
appeal.
there
are
those
that
they've
got,
issued
cpc's
but...
probable
cause
to
appeal...
but
not...
haven't
heard
it.
there
are
those
that
they've
argued
it
at
a
hearing
or
just
about
ready
to
release.
there
are
dozens
of
combinations,
some
filed
initially
within
the
1
year,
some
filed
not
within
the
1
year.
is
it
plausible
or
possible
that
congress
wanted
the
courts
to
go
into
each
of
those
permutations
and
combinations
and
figure
out
somewhat
different
rules
as
we
try
to
work
out
how
to
apply
this
thing
retroactively?
that's
the
thing
that
worries
me
about
it
the
most,
because
it
seems
to
me...
it
can't
be
true,
for
example,
that
a
person
who's
already
on
appeal,
who's
argued
his
case,
and
the
judge
is
just
about
to
release
the
decision,
or
has
released
it
but
the
mandate
hasn't
come
down,
is
now
supposed
to
go
back
to
stage
1
and...
or
is
he?
i
mean,
suppose
that
he
filed
his
initial
petition
1
year
and
5
days
after
the
conviction
took
place.
does
it
count?
i
mean,
my
mind
began
to
swim
with
possible
combinations
and
so
i
wondered
if
congress
really
intended
us
to
do
all
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
at
the
time
the
state
court
took
it
on
collateral
review.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
would
make
for
a
fairly
simple
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
back--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
you
wouldn't
be
going
back
very
far.
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
be
going
back
to
the
date
of
the
indictment,
or
the
date
of
the
conduct,
or
to
the
date
of
the
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
be
a
fairly
short
term
of
reference.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's...
may
i
interrupt
you
just--
justice
david
h.
souter
--before
you
get
too
far
afield.
let's
assume
that
we
disagree
with
you
there,
and
then
we
say,
well,
these
provisions
were
enacted
simultaneously,
and
that
certainly
is
a
circumstance
that
leads
to
a
strong
rather
than
a
weak
negative
inference.
is
it
your
position
that
if
we
say
yes,
there
does
seem
to
be
a
strong
legitimate
negative
inference
to
be
drawn
here,
that
we
still
could
not
give
effect
to
that,
or
we
could
not
recognize
that
inference,
because
under
landgraf
it
still
was
not
an
express
provision?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
be
the
reason
for
our
displacing...
what
would
be
the
good
reason
for
our
displacing
a
fairly
sound
rule
of
construction...
we'll
say
a
strong
negative
inference
rule.
what
would
be
our
reason
for
displacing
that
from
this
particular
subject
matter
of
interpretation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume...
let
me
make
it
easier.
let's
assume
that
we
say
well,
we
did
use
the
word
express,
but
we
really
didn't
mean
it
in
quite
so
starchy
a
sense
as
you
mean
it.
we
mean
provisions
that
are
reasonably
ascertainable
from
the
text
of
the
statute.
do
you
think
there
is
a
good
reason
why,
if
that
is
to
be
our
standard,
we
shouldn't
apply
a
negative
inference
rule
in
a
case
in
which
the
inference
can
be
drawn
quite
strongly?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
justice
breyer
has
pointed
out,
we
might
say,
well,
we're
going
to
have
a
very
procrustean
rule
on
a
landgraf
model
saying
you've
got
to
be
express
in
this
abundantly
obvious
way
or
we're
not
going
to
recognize
it,
and
the
argument
for
that
would
be,
well,
it
keeps
the
analysis
simple.
but
justice
breyer's
question
shows
that
if
in
fact
we
took
that
position
we
would
then
land
ourselves
in
this
particular
case,
or
land
all
of
the
federal
courts
that
have
to
pass
on
these
things,
in
a
situation
in
which
a
lot
of
very
complicated
case-by-case
analysis
is
going
to
have
to
go
on,
so
maybe
it
would
be
better
to
sort
of
confront
intent
at
the
front
end
under
our
normal
rules,
assuming
there's
a
textual
basis
in
the
statute
for
the
application
of
some
interpretive
rule,
and
have
a
simpler
result
in
applying
the
statute
in
individual
cases.
wouldn't
that
be
a
good
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
that
argument
in
effect
is
you
cannot
soundly
draw
a
negative
influence.
