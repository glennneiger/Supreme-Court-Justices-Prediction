well,
mr.
liebman,
what
rights
are
we
talking
about,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
confront
witnesses?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
so
you're
not
relying
on
lindh's
right
to
confront
witnesses,
but
just
the
statutory
right
to
habeas
relief.
that's
all
you're
talking
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
take
it
you
do
agree,
though,
that
it
might
be
a
lot
simpler
if
the
law
just
applied
to
new
petitions
for
federal
habeas.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
simplify
a
lot
of
these
issues.
