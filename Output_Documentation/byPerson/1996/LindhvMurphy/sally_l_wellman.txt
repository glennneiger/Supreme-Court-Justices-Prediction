ms.
sally
l.
wellman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
asks
this
court
to
hold
that
2254(d),
which
limits
the
circumstances
in
which
the
federal
court
may
exercise
its
jurisdiction
to
grant
habeas
relief,
applies
to
petitions
pending
on
the
date
of
2254(d)'s
enactment.
it
applies
to
cases
pending
on
the
date
of
enactment
because
1)
it
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
to
grant
relief.
2)
when
we're
talking
about
habeas,
we're
talking
first
and
foremost
about
a
reviewing
process.
although
it's
different
from
an
appeal,
it's
like
an
appeal
in
that
one--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
thank
you,
your
honor.
it's
a
reviewing
process
that
reviews
what
the...
what
a
lower
court
decision
has
already
done,
so
it's
not
reviewing
in
the...
it's
not
determinating
rights
and
responsibilities
and
duties
and
obligations
between
parties
in
the
first
instance.
it's
reviewing
the
judgment
and
decision
rendered
by
the
state
court.
in
that
sense
also
it
is
forward-looking.
it's
injunctive
in
the
sense
that
the
right
to
habeas
relief
is
a
right
for
the
custody
to
end.
it
does
not
go
back
and
give
damages
if
the
petitioner
had
been
confined
unconstitutionally
for
20
years,
he
does
not
get
damages
for
that.
it
imposes
no
liability
against
the
state
in
that
sense,
but
rather
it
ends
the
custody.
from
this
day
forward
you
are
released
from
custody
unless
the
state
retries
you,
so
it
is
forward-looking
in
that
sense,
and
in
that
sense,
until
the
federal
court
has
reached
that
determination
of
whether
it
will
order
that
custody
shall
cease
or
not,
2254(d)
is
not
applying
backwards
in
any
sense.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
it
is
in
that
sense,
but
it
is
not
backward-looking
in
the
sense
of
tort
action,
in
that
the
remedy
to
a
person
or
the
liability
to
a
person,
you're
not...
the
state
is
not
going
to
pay
in
the
sense
of
damages.
it's
not
backward-looking
in
that
sense.
certainly
whether
custody
shall
continue
or
not
depends
on
what
happens
before,
but
that
cannot
be
the
test
of
whether
there
are
retroactive
effects,
because--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--that's
right.
it's
not
a
perfect
analogy,
and
as
landgraf
recognized
most
of
these
categories
that
the
law
has
drawn
are
not
drawn
with
perfect
philosophical
clarity,
but
it
is
like
an
injunction
in
the
sense
that
it
says,
henceforth
custody
must
cease.
it
is
like
an
appeal
remedy
in
the
sense
that
it's
reviewing
what
a
court
has
already
done.
in
both
of
those
senses
it
is
adjudic...
we're
looking,
we're
really
focusing
on
the
adjudicative
process
of
the
federal
court
itself.
we're
not
focus--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--i
think
that
you
must
do
that
because
congress
was
silent,
and
when
congress
is
silent,
then
the
court
has
to
do
the
landgraf
analysis
as
to
the
particular
provision
at
issue.
however,
i
don't
think--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--well,
certainly
landgraf
had
been
decided
before
this
was...
became
law
by
about
2
years.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
if
congress
knew
about
landgraf,
they
understood
the
entire
decision,
and
as
i
understand
landgraf,
and
as
we
argue,
what
it
clarifies
is
that
there
are
two
default
rules.
the
court
deciding
a
case
shall
apply
the
rule
in
existence
at
the
time
of
decision
unless
giving
the
particular
provision
at
issue
would
have
a
retroactive
effect,
and
it
defines--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--i--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--i
think
when
you
read
that
what
you
have
to
understand
is
that
when
the
court...
starting
with
landgraf,
when
the
court
says
the
default
rule
is
prospective
for
a
retroactive
statute
it
means
statutes
that
have
a
retroactive
effect
as
they
define
it
in
landgraf,
which
is,
attach
new
legal
consequences
to
conduct
completed
before
enactment,
and
new
legal
consequences
means
only
in
paravested
rights
that
had
become
a
right
before,
under
the
existing
law,
impose
new
liabilities
on
conduct
that
had
already
occurred
and
was
completed,
or
impose
new
duties
on
transactions
that
were
already
completed.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
that's--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--from
when
and
after
what?
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
that's
right.
if,
for
example--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--where
do
you
begin,
and
where
you
begin
as
to
2254(d),
which
tells
the
federal
court
under
the
situations
in
which
it
can
grant
relief,
if
the
state
court
decision
is
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
u.s.
supreme
court
precedent,
as
long
as
that
decision
and
determination
has
not
been
made
yet,
then
applying
the
statute
to
that
decision
is
prospective.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
yes,
i
think
it...
i
understand
your
concern,
and
i
think
it's
well-taken.
what
we
do
is,
we
look
at
the
proceedings
at
the
point...
as
to
all
petitions
that
had
already
been
filed.
whatever
stage
that
particular
petition
was
at
on
april
24,
1996,
is
where
we
pick
up
and
apply
the
new
law.
so
as
with
mr.
lindh
his
appeal
was
pending,
the
seventh
circuit
had
not
reached
a
decision
yet,
it
was
to
apply
2254(d),
and
it
did
indeed
ask
the
parties
to
rebrief
both
retroactivity
and
what
the
new
statute
means
and
how
it
applies
to
his
case.
it
did
not
go
back
and
say,
well,
we
have
to
look
at
was
your
petition
filed
within
1
year
or
not.
it
did
not
go
back
and
look
and
say,
well,
did
you
have
the
new
certificate
of
appealability.
those
things
that
are
already
done
are
done
and
over,
and
you
just
start
where
you
are.
if--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--the
seventh
circuit
would
have
to
apply
new
2254(d),
because
that's
governing
that
court's
decision
whether
to
grant
or
deny
habeas,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
a
little
bit
unlike
a
normal
appeal,
because
the
habeas
law
has
always
recognized
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
not
just
reviewing
what
the
district
court
did
and
whether
it
did
it
right,
but
it
is
independently
determining
whether
to
grant
a
habeas
writ.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
he...
for
the
trans...
he
would
get
the
chance
to
make
the
new
arguments,
i
believe,
as
the
seventh
circuit
did
here.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
what
we're
determining
here
is
whether
the
state
court's
decision
on
the
facts
as
known
in
the
state
court...
he
never
offered
before
to
offer
new
evidence.
he
never
challenged
the
presumption
of
correctness
of
the
state
court
findings,
so
we're
dealing
with
a
set
issue
of
facts
and
the
law
as
under
this--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--absolutely
not.
there
never
was,
and
he
never
challenged
the
presumption
of
correctness
as
to
the
facts
found
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
so
in
that
situation
all
you're
doing
is
you're...
as
a
reviewing
court
you're
looking
at
was
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
decision,
which
is
the
final
decision
in
the
state
court,
contrary
to
clearly
established
u.s.
supreme
court
precedent
or
an
unreasonable
application?
at
that
point,
except
for
making
those
arguments
to
the
court,
which
he
certainly
was
entitled
to
do
and
did
here,
there
is
nothing
different
he
could
have
done
at
any
stage.
what
would
he
have
argued
differently
to
the
state
supreme
court
to
try
to
get
an
unreasonable
decision
so
he
can
win
on
habeas?
that
just
makes
no
sense.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
no.
i
don't
think--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
we're
discussing
whether
congress
said
x
or
y.
we're
discussing
what
this
court
does
under
landgraf
when
congress--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--is
silent
as
to
2254(d).
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that...
two
things.
1)
i
don't
think
it's
that
complicated
because
we're
taking
out
all
of
the
problems
of
what
happened
up
till
now.
if
he's
filed
his
petition,
he's
okay.
if
he's
gotten
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
he's
okay.
if
he's
gotten
a
special
hearing,
he's
okay.
if
a
final
decision
had
been
rendered
by
the
seventh
circuit
on
april
22
and
this
new
law
came
down,
we
would
not
have
been
able
to
go
back
in--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--because
as
this
court
explained
in
landgraf,
whenever
a
new
statute
comes
into
effect
that
involves
the
proceedings,
an
ongoing
proceeding,
we
start
with
the
point
at
which
we're
at
when
the
new
law
comes
into
effect,
for
example,
if
a
statute
case
gave...
took
away
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
if
the
case
was
in
the
middle
of
a
jury
trial
i
don't
think
anyone
would
say,
oh,
let's
stop.
let's
send
the
jurors
home
and
let's
start
over
and
have
a
trial
to
the
court.
if
it
had
not
proceeded
to
a
jury
trial
yet,
if
the
case
had
been
filed
and
you
were
in
the
early
stages,
he
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
even
though
when
he
did
the
underlying
conduct,
when
he
made
his
decision
what
court
to
file
in
and
what
to
make
the
cause
of
action,
even
though
he
expected
to
get
a
jury
at
that
point.
so
that
part
i
think
is
fairly
straightforward.
in
addition,
i
don't
think
the
flip
is
true
that
the
rule
that
mr.
liebman
would
ask
us
to
apply
is
easy,
because
what
he's
saying
is
that
because
154...
yes,
because
107(c)
of
154
says
that
the
statute
applies
to
154
cases
pending
on
or
after
the
date
of
enactment,
it
means
that
153
does
not
apply
to
cases
pending
on
or
after
the
date
of
enactment,
but
it
doesn't
tell
us
then
when
does
it
start
applying.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
right.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
that's
certainly
possible,
because
what
landgraf
did,
although
i
do
think
it
certainly
clarifies
the
prior
law,
it
does
still
in
essence
need
two
different
default
rules.
one
is,
if
it
is
the
type
of
statute
that
falls
within
the
class
of
cases
that
has
a
retroactive
effect,
then
it
will
be
presumed
not
to
apply.
if
it
does
not
fall
within
that
class
of
cases,
however,
then
it
does
apply,
so
you
still
have
to
determine
at
some
point
which
class
does
it
fall
in.
one
way
to
look
at
that,
i
think,
is
to
say
if
it's
jurisdictional,
if
it
goes
primarily
to
what
the
court
does,
not
the
parties,
if
it's
procedural,
as
it
is
here,
if
it's
a
secondary
layer
of
conduct
as
it
is
here,
adjudication
is
secondary
as
opposed
to
primary
conduct,
if
it's
one
of
those
things,
then
you
simply
don't
do
the
landgraf
analysis.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
i
think...
yes.
i
think
as
long
as
we
were
in
the
direct
review
line--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--well,
only
if
this
court
accepted...
i'm
sorry.
only
if
this
court
accepted
cert
in
that
case.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
you...
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
mean,
you
deny
certs
all
the
time--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--without
looking
at
the
individual
case.
[laughter]
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
but
i
think
it's
important
that
we
look
at
whether...
when
a
decision
was
final
here,
and
that's--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--well,
i
don't
think
they'd
have
to
send
it
back.
i
think
they
would
decide
it
under
the
new
standard
as
the
seventh
circuit
did
here.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
he
does
not
get
that.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
because
in
the
habeas
case
the
seventh
circuit
itself
is
determining
whether
to
grant
habeas
or
not.
if
it
were
just
reviewing
whether
the
district
court
was
right
or
wrong,
you
might
have
a
different
answer,
but
the
seventh
circuit
is
not
limited
to
that,
but
it
is
itself,
the
court
of
appeals,
determining
whether
to
grant
habeas
and
to
make
that
decision
it
will
apply
the
new
law.
otherwise,
what
we're
saying
is
that
at
any
moment
in
time
in
which
the
defendant
or
petitioner
has
the
law
in
his
favor,
he
wins
for
all
time
no
matter
how
it
changes,
and
lockhart
v.
fretwell
teaches
us
that
that
cannot
be
so.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
it's--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--well,
it
would
simplify
it
on
a
superficial
level,
but
if
i
understand
petitioner's
argument
as
to
why
you
would
do
that,
you
would
only
do
that
if
it
has
a
retroactive
effect,
and
since
he's
saying
that
part
and
parcel
of
this
whole
thing
is
that
the
state
court
decision
was
wrong,
the
state
supreme
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
need
to
start
behind
the
filing
of
the
petition.
the
filing
of
a
lawsuit
in
and
of
itself
never
controls
the
"retroactivity
question".
it's,
does
the
law
at
the
time
of
decision
apply,
or
the
law
at
the
time
of
conduct?
conduct
is
not
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
that
we're
talking
about.
it
either
has
to
be
the
time
of
the
crime,
which
was
almost
10
years
ago
now,
or
at
least
the
time
of
the
state
court's
decision,
which
is
1991,
to
be
consistent
with
any
theory
of
retroactive
effect.
in
landgraf
they
never
looked
at...
i'm
not
sure
you
even
mentioned...
when
she
filed
her
lawsuit.
the
question
was,
does
the
law
at
the
time
of
our
decision,
the
court
in
question's
decision,
or
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
discriminatory
conduct
apply?
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
that's
possible.
i
mean,
you
could
have--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--well--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--but
you
would
have
to
go
back
to
at
least
whatever
that
point
in
time
was.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
but
here
we're
talking
at
least...
'91,
'96...
it's
about
6
years.
in
felker,
you
would
have
had
to
go
back
many,
many
years
in
felker
because
nobody
thought
about
it
in
terms
of
do
we
go
back
to
the
underlying...
i
mean...
i
guess...
i
lost
my
train
of
thought.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
i
think
the
most
likely
explanation
is
that
154
speaks
in
language
that
sounds
futuristic.
it
says,
if
a
state
court
establishes
procedures
for
competent
counsel
at
post
conviction
hearings,
and
if
they
establish
this
and
establish
that,
and
i
think
someone
late
in
the
game
realized
a
concern.
oh,
that
sounds
like
if
a
state
already
has
what
would
pass
under
154,
then
they
won't
get
the
benefits
of
154,
and
we
don't
want
that
to
happen,
so
we
want
to
make
sure
that
anyone
already
in
compliance
gets
the
benefits
of
154.
as
to
153,
there
are
any
number
of
inferences
which
is
why
the
negative
inference
that
petitioner
wants
you
to
draw
cannot
be
controlling,
because
there
are
too
many
possibilities.
maybe
they
didn't
think
about
it.
maybe
they
didn't
agree.
maybe--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--surely.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
yes.
i--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--it
is
my
position
that
a
negative
inference
is
not
an
express
prescription
of
the
temporal
reach
of
the
statute.
that
much
i
think
landgraf
made
very,
very
clear.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons.
one
reason
is
that
in
order
for
a
negative
inference
to
ever
be
the
equivalent
of
an
express
command
it
would
have
to
be
the
only
reasonable
inference
you
could
draw,
and
i
don't
believe
you
could
do
that
here.
assuming
that--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--i
think
what
you're
going
to
be
doing
is
doing
a
lot
more
of
generalized
statutory
intent
construction,
statutory...
concerning
the
statutory
intent
before
you
ever
get
to
retroactivity
analysis.
and
i
think
that
in
landgraf
what
we
wanted
to
do
was
to
get
to
the
heart
of
the
matter,
and
the
heart
of
the
matter
is,
congress,
if
you've
thought
this
through
and
you've
done
the
balancing
of
interests,
and
you
know
what
you
want,
tell
us
and
that's
what
we'll
do.
if
you
haven't,
we're
going
to
look
at
this
statute,
what
does
it
do,
what
is
the
change,
what
is
the
degree
of
connection
between
the
change
and
the
conduct
regulated,
and
if
that
has
a
retroactive
effect
impairing
a
vested
right,
attaching
new
liabilities,
we
won't
apply
it,
so
at
least
someone
is
doing
that
balancing
process,
and
congress
may
do
it.
you
can
encourage
congress
to
do
it,
but
whereas
here
if
they
don't
do
it,
then
you...
the
court
should
be
doing
that
balancing
process,
and
if
you
just
do
your
generalized
statutory
maximums
about
intent
and
negative
inference,
you're
never
going
to
get
to
that
point.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
no.
i
don't
meant...
but
i
don't
mean
to
sound
circular,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you're
going
to
do
that...
i
mean,
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
2254(d)
applies,
and
if...
what
you're
saying
is
because
they
say
154
applies
to
all
cases
pending,
then
none
of
153
applies
to
cases
pending.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
too
many
different
things
to
draw
a
negative
inference
from,
that
there
may
be
reasons
why
congress
would
want
the
statute
of
limitations
not
to
apply
to
pending
cases.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
that's
right.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
there
are
just
too
many
choices,
too
many
variables.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
it's
my
position
that
2254(d)
does.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
i
don't
know
that
we
can
say
that
the
entire
chapter
does,
and
if
by
that
you
would
mean
that
if
you
have
already
filed
your
petition
and
you're
well
into
the
case,
but
it
wasn't
within
the
1
year,
we're
going
to
kick
you
out.
or
if
you're
already
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we're
ready
to
decide
your
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
we're
going
to
kick
you
out
because
you
don't
have
a
certificate
of
appealability.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
thank
you.
