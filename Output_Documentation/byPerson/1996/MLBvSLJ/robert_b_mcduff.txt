mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
a
result
of
an
order
of
the
chancery
court
of
benton
county,
mississippi,
my
client
is
no
longer
the
mother
to
her
children
in
the
eyes
of
the
law.
the
only
way
she
can
become
their
mother
again
under
the
law
is
through
the
appeal
that
is
available
as
a
matter
of
right
under
mississippi
law.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
can,
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
prevent
her
from
taking
that
appeal
in
a
case
of
this
magnitude
without
even
considering
her
claim
that
she
is
too
poor
to
pay
the
$2,300
fee
that
the
state
has
imposed.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
i
just
mean
that
they
have
not
even
considered
her
claim
that
she
is
too
poor,
which
would
involve
a
consideration
of
her
income.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
or
they...
well,
they
could
do
a
number
of
things
that
would
allow
her
to
appeal.
i
mean,
one
is
they
could
excuse
her
as
in
a
normal
in
forma
pauperis
case,
and
allow
her
to
proceed
without
a
payment
to
the
court
reporter.
another
is,
they
could
set
up
a
schedule
of
payments.
another
is,
they
could
have
her
sign
a
note.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
under
state
law
as
it
is
written
now,
that
is
correct,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
in
response
to
the
claim
of
the
state
that
if
we
win
this
case
this
will
involve
an
incredible
outlay
from
the
state
treasury,
if
mississippi
chooses
it
can
change
state
law
so
that
in
certain
cases
the
court
reporter
is
not
paid
$2
a
page.
the
court
reporter
here
is
an
employee
of
the
state,
makes
$33,000
a
year
in
salary.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
assume
that's
true
certainly
for
many,
if
not
all.
but
mississippi
could
do,
for
instance,
as
texas
has
done,
or
has
west
virginia
has
done.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
certainly,
yes,
and
i
mean
our
point
here--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--well,
for
the
same
reason
expressed
in
the
majority
opinions
in
griffin
and
the
long
line
of
cases
that
have
followed
griffin.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
in,
for
example,
lindsey
v.
normet,
which
is
a
civil
case,
this
court
expressed
the
same
principle
that,
if...
once
the
right
of
appeal
is
provided
by
a
state
as
a
means
of
promoting
accuracy
and
as
a
means
of
correcting
errors
and
correcting
injustices,
it
cannot
be
taken
away
in
an
arbitrary
fashion,
and
that's
our
argument
here,
is
that
the
interest
in
this
case
is
so
important
that
the
same
principle
should
apply
here
that
applies
in
griffin
and--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--certainly,
but
this
is
different
than
someone
who
comes
along
and
says
well,
i
want
the
government
to
pay
for
something
i
can...
i
want
to
purchase
on
the
free
market,
whether
it's
a
car,
or
whatever.
this
is
where
a
citizen
has
been
brought
into
the
court
system
for
the
sole
purpose
of
attempting
to
terminate
her
relationship
with
her
children,
and
she
is
thereby
subject
to
all
of
the
power
of
the
state.
now...
and
subject
to
the
court
system
that
has
the
unique
ability
to
terminate
forever
her
relationship
with
her
children.
now,
in
mississippi,
as
in
most
states,
the
state
has
chosen
to
provide
a
level
of
accuracy
and
a
level
of
corrective
review
for
errors
and
injustices
through
its
appellate
courts,
but
my
client
is
being
told,
because
she's
poor,
she
can't
take
advantage
of
that,
while
those
who
have
money
can.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that
argument
would
have
the
same
weight
we
have
here
because
of
the
difference.
i
mean,
when
a
person
loses
custody,
even
though
the
child
may
leave
the
home,
the
parent
can
still
visit
with
the
child.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
or...
and
even
if
it
doesn't--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--even...
it
doesn't
in
most
custody
orders,
no.
there
is
an
element
of
an
ability
to
communicate,
to
play
a
role
in
the
child's
life,
and
in
the
future,
if
conditions
change,
the
parent
can
petition
for
visitation
or
petition
for
custody.
by
contrast,
with
a
termination--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes,
i--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
and
one
example
is
santosky
v.
kramer,
where
this
court
held
that
in
parental
termination
cases,
because
of
the
severity,
because
of
the
finality
and
the
irrevocability,
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
was
necessary
before
terminating
parental
rights.
in
mississippi,
the
mississippi
legislature
adopted
that
after
this
court's
decision
in
santosky,
but
mississippi
has
not
adopted,
and
other
states
have
not,
for
that
reason
adopted
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
when
the
state
seeks
to
take
custody
from
parents
without
terminating
their
rights.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
the
distinction
i
think
there,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
in
harris
the
citizen
wanted
an
abortion
paid
by
the
government
that
she
would
be
receiving
on
the
free
market
of
something
she
chose
to
obtain.
here--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes,
but
it
was
done
through
the
governmental
program
of
medicaid,
is
what
the
citizen
was
seeking.
here,
by
contrast,
where
the...
the
petitioner
has
been
brought
into
the
court
system,
where
the
state
has
set
up
the
exclusive
mechanism
for
terminating
her
parental
rights,
and
all
she
is
asking
is
that
she
receive
the
same
protections
that
have
been
set
up
by
that
system--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--that
a
wealthier
person
would
receive.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes,
and
we're
not
basing
our
claim
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
state
has
this
exclusive
power,
but
we
are
basing
it
in
part.
the
difference
between
our
case
and
the
case
you
cite,
i
think,
is
the
fact
that
housing
and
ownership
of
land
does
not
have
the
same
constitutional
status
as
the
relationship
with
one's
children,
and
this
court
said
that
in
lindsey
v.
normet,
i
think,
when
talking
about
how
housing
does
not
have
the
sort
of
constitutional
magnitude
that
exists
in
other
cases
like
this.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh,
certainly
it's
important,
but
i
think
that...
i
think
this
court's
long
line
of
decisions
have
noted
that
family
relationships
between
children
and
parents
are
of
a
much
greater
constitutional
magnitude,
and
the
notion
of
liberty--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--there
would
be
less
of
a
case
in
that
situation--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--than
we
have
here.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes,
less
of
an
argument.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh,
yes.
i
think
less
of
an
argument,
because
the
right
here...
for
example,
in
the
case
you
just
posit,
justice
scalia,
if
someone
goes
into
court
and
tries
to
take
away
some
privilege
of
a
person
because
of
these
types
of
accusations,
as
long
as
they're
not
criminal--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--there's
no
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard.
here,
the
court
has
held
in
santosky,
in
lassiter
where
the
court
discussed
the
right
to
counsel,
has
held
the
determination
of
parental
rights
works
a
grievous
harm
that
is
unlike
no
other
save,
perhaps,
involuntary
incarceration.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
think
paternity
is
much
closer
to
what
we
have
here.
now,
there's
one
difference,
and
i'm
not...
i
don't
know
this
in
detail,
but
my
understanding
is
that
now,
with
the
new
dna
technology,
that
paternity
can
be
established
or
disestablished
with
something
close
to
certainty,
so
that
the...
i
think
the
court
can
take
into
account--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--the
appropriateness
of
the--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
right.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
think
paternity
is
very
close
to
the
case
we
have
here,
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--i
think...
i
think
one
distinction
would
be
that
in
a
parental
termination
case
you
do
have
a
constitutionally
imposed
standard
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
in
which
appellate
review...
in
which
there
is
a
role
for
appellate
review
in
assuring
that
is
carried
out,
as
opposed
to
the
parental
termination,
where
you
do
not
have
a...
i
mean,
as
opposed
to
the
paternity,
where
you
do
not
have
a
constitutionally
imposed
standard,
and
i
note
in
this
connection
a
number
of
times
this
court
has
said
that,
for
example,
in
the
punitive
damages
cases,
that
where
a
state
establishes
appellate
review,
it
can
play
a
role
in
protecting
constitutional
rights,
and
so
i
think
that
argument
exists
here
that
wouldn't
exist
in
the
paternity
case
with
respect
to
the
level
of
evidence
that's
required.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
think
that
is
certainly
a
way
the
court
could
draw
the
line
in
future
cases.
now,
again
though,
we
are
not
asking
for
economic
equality
in
presenting
the
case.
i
mean,
this
court's
decision
in
ross--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes,
and
i'm
referring
specifically,
though,
to--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--well,
i
think
because
of
the
reasoning
this
court
expressed
in
the
majority
opinion
in
ross
v.
moffitt.
i
mean,
the
equal
protection
clause.
although
that
wasn't
the
context
of
the
criminal
case,
i
think
the
reasoning
is
applicable
here,
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
give
a
person
the
right
to
duplicate
the
legal
arsenal
of
a
wealthier
person
in
presenting
the
case,
but
it
does,
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
give
a
right
to
present
the
case
in
the
first
place
where
the
interest
is
important
and
where
the
state
has
set
up
these
mechanisms
for
promoting
accuracy
and
for
correcting
injustices.
the--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes.
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
don't
think
so,
and
of
course
the...
i
mean,
the
griffin
line
of
cases
has
employed
both
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses,
and
i
think
the
difference,
i
guess,
is...
was
expressed
by
this
court's
majority
opinion
in
evitts
v.
lucey,
describing
the
griffin
line,
where
it
said
the
due
process
claim
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
state
has
set
up
these
appellate
procedures
to
promote
accuracy
and
so
forth,
and
therefore
the
state
acts
arbitrarily
towards
a
citizen
when
it
takes
them
away,
in
effect,
and
when
it
does
not
give
the
citizen
the
full
benefit
of
that
panoply
of
protection.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
mean,
you
do
have
a
point
in
the
sense
that
in
the
griffin
line
the
two
have
gone
together,
but
i
do
think
it's
a
separate
analysis.
i
mean,
if
the
state
has
set
this
up,
and
if
the
state
is
telling
a
person
that
it
should...
that
it
has
made
these...
this
level
of
review
available
and
then...
i
do
think
it's
an
arbitrary
action,
even
though
you
might
consider
it's,
quote,
rational
for
equal
protection
purposes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
there
is--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--the
judge's...
the
judge's
written
order
came
after
the
trial
was
over,
and
so
it
can
be
raised
on
appeal,
and
will
be
if
an
appeal
is
permitted.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
we're
not
making
any
merits
arguments--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes.
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
think
we
could.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
as
strong
an
argument,
but
yes,
i
think
as
long
as
mississippi
supreme
court
requires
a
transcript
to
review
contentions
that
the
trial
judge's
findings
and
conclusions
were
unsupported
by
the
evidence
or
contrary
to
the
evidence,
and
assuming
that
argument
could
still
be
made
after
this
opinion,
yes,
we
would
still
have
the
same
contention.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
don't
think
so,
i
mean,
because
the
fact
that
the
state
says
yes,
you
have
to
have
a
transcript
in
the
beginning
to
take
the
appeal
is
simply
a
procedural
rule
that
it
imposes,
and
because
it
conditions
it
on
this
$2
payment
per
page
to
a
court
reporter,
i
think
it
is
the
same
sort
of
barrier
that
you
would
have,
and
that's
why
i
think
griffin
and
its...
that
line
of
cases
went
off
not
only
on
equal
protection
but
on
due
process.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
the
parent
who
is
denied
custody
and
visitation
rights
can
later
petition
to
regain
them
if
conditions
change,
and
depending
on
the
order
may
still
be
able
to
have
some
contact
with
the
child
over
the
telephone,
or
letters,
or
still
participate
in
decisions.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
it
does
mean
that
you
are
erased
from
the
child's
life
as
their
parent
save
for
any
grace
given
by
the
ex-husband
and
the
new
mother,
who
i
guess
could
allow
the
children
to
visit
with
you,
but
otherwise--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--but
with
no
custody
and
no
visitation
you
can
petition
when
conditions
change.
with
the
termination
of
parental
rights,
as
this
court
said
in
santosky
is,
one
of
the
reasons
it
imposes
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
rule,
it
is
final
and
irrevocable.
the
chancery
court's
order
here
illustrates
it.
i
mean,
it
ordered
that
the
name
of
my
client
be
taken
off
the
children's
birth
certificate
as
their
mother
and
replaced
by
the
name
of
the
new
mother.
now,
that's
symbolic,
but
i
think
it
symbolizes
the
dramatic
difference
here,
and
that's
why
i
think
this
court
ordered
clear
and
convincing
evidence
as
the
appropriate
standard
in
these
cases,
but
it
has
not
been
ordered
in
custody
cases
of
the
type
you're
talking
about.
the--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--we
think--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh,
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that's
also...
that's
true
in
the
griffin
line
of
cases.
for
example,
in
mayer
v.
city
of
chicago
the
court
held
that
a
transcript
is
necessary
for
a...
an
appeal
of
a
convic...
a
misdemeanor
conviction
in
which
no
jail
time
is
imposed,
but
the
court
said
in
scott
v.
illinois
that
counsel
was
not
required,
so
i
think
that
they
are
not
coextensive
in
terms
of
the
breadth
of
the
constitutional
principles.
the--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--involuntary
civil
commitment,
i
think,
is
of
this
magnitude.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
justice
scalia,
i
think
through
the
same
process
this
court
has
gone
through
in
the
cases,
for
example,
involving
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard,
where
it
has
imposed
them
as
a
constitutional
matter,
in
involuntary
civil--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--i
think
it's
the
traditional
sort
of
fourteenth
amendment
analysis
where
you--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--the
guardian
ad
litem's
payment
was
awarded
as
costs
by
the
chancery
court
against
the
plaintiff,
who's
the
ex-husband.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no,
i'm
sorry,
it
was
awarded
against
the...
the
costs
were
awarded
against
the
person
who
actually
prevailed
in
the
case--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--in
this
instance,
who
is
the
father.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i...
there
were
several
possibilities
there.
i
guess
the
court,
either
the
chancery
court
or
the
supreme
court
could
have
ordered
one
of
the
parties
to
pay
it,
or
i
think
the
guardian
might
have.
if
the
guardian
could
not
afford
it,
and
if
the
guardian--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--right.
the...
i
think
the
same
principle
that
we
are
invoking
here
might
be
available
if
the
guardian
is
able
to
claim,
as
the
guardian
could
do
in
claiming
the
rights
of
the
child.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
five
and
seven,
i
believe--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--at
the
time
of
the
termination.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
yes,
and
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
the
provision
of
the
mississippi
rules
to
that
effect.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
in
mississippi,
it
is
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
there's
a
mississippi
statute
that
provides
that
it
will
be
paid
for
in
involuntary
civil
commitments.
now,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
a
stated
principle
that
it
stated
in
this
case
that
in
forma
pauperis
appeals
are
not
allowed
in
any
civil
case,
but
in
fact
there
is
this
statute
that
apparently
the
court
was
not
considering
when
it
made
that
statement
both
in
this
case
and
in
several
prior
cases.
the...
justice
kennedy,
you
earlier
were
talking
about
the
equal
protection
clause
and
whether...
and
what
would
happen
if
the
court
found
that
the
mississippi
scheme
here
was
rational.
we
actually
do
think
that,
because
of
the
interest
involved
here,
that
there
is
something
greater
than
rational
relationship
test,
and
something
greater
than
minimal
scrutiny,
and
that
at
the
very
least
intermediate
scrutiny
would
be
appropriate
give,
number
1,
the
fundamental
interest
in
the
parental
right,
and
the
fundamental
interest
in
what
this
court
has
called
an
accurate
determination
regarding
that
right.
and
specifically
i'm
referring
to
the
lassiter
case,
so
for
that
reason
we
think
that
the
justification
offered
by
the
state,
particularly
this
$2
per
page
thing,
which
is
not
required
at
all
for
the
state
to
continue...
for
it
to
keep
its
court
system
going
and
does
not
promote
the
state's
interest
in
accuracy
which
it
has
expressed
by
providing
these
appellate
courts,
that
the
state
has
not
put
forward
a
persuasive
or
substantial--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
they
could,
but
i
think
they
certainly
would
be
able
to
keep
them
if,
for
example,
they
continued
paying
them
the
$33,000
a
year
they
receive,
continue
to
allow
them
to
receive
$2
per
page
for
the
many
paid
transcripts
they
do
during
the
year,
but
said
that
these
in
forma
pauperis
transcripts
are
going
to
be
part
of
your
duty
as
a
salaried
state
employee.
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
it
was
in
response
to
questions
from
you
that
the
attorney
general's
office
gave
figures
about
the
number
of
filings
of
termination
cases
in
the
chancery
court,
and
those
figures
are
at
page
28
of
their
brief,
but
those
figures
are
not
in
the
sources
they
cite
on
page
28,
and
we
have
not
seen
any
such
figures
about
the
number
of
parental
termination
filings
in
chancery
courts
or
in
the
appellate
courts.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
does
keep
figures,
and
we've
cited
them
in
our
brief,
as
have
our
opponents,
on
the
numbers
of
custody
appeals,
of
which
parental
termination
are
a
subset,
and
in
1995
there
were
10
custody
cases
decided
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
and
another
six
decided
by
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no,
sir,
and
a
divorce
also
is
something
actually
that
can
be
remedied
in
the
future
if
people
want
to
remarry,
plus
they
can
continue
to
have
contact
or
not
contact.
there's
a
level
of
freedom
in
the
relationship.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that
involves
nearly
the
kind
of
termination
of
an
intimate
relationship
beyond
the
control
of
the
parent
that
you
have,
or
beyond
the
control
of
the
party
involved
that
you
have
when
a
child
is
taken
away
against
your
will
by
state
action.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
the
rationale
of
boddie,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
divorce,
because
it
involves
a
marriage
relationship,
is
very
important,
and
because
the
state
has
an
exclusive
monopoly
on
it,
that
filing
fees
that
freeze
people
out
are
unconstitutional,
so
i
think
there
is
a
high
status
and
an
important
interest
here,
but
i
don't
think
it
comes
to
the
kind
of
grievous
injury
that's
done
here.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no,
i
didn't...
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
mean
to
sort
of
do
a
gradation
there,
but
in
boddie
the
people
were
married
and
wanted
access
to
the
state-created
apparatus
for
obtaining
a
divorce,
and
this
court
said
they
can't
be
frozen
out
by
a
certain
amount
of
money,
and
when
you're
talking
about
appeal,
i
do
think
that
is
different.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--yes,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
sort
of--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--and
i
guess
that's
what
we're
saying,
is
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
harm
here
as
compared
to
whatever
happens
in
a
divorce
proceeding,
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
where
a
transcript
will
be
required
and
it
might
not
there.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no,
on
the
theory
that
a
divorce
decree,
or
the
resolution
of
a
divorce
case,
involves
all
kinds
of
complicated
mechanisms
that
the
parties
have
a
right
to
effect
in
terms
of
their
interrelationship,
but
here,
the
person's
child
is
being
taken
away
against
their
will,
and
we
think
it's
a
qualitative--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes.
