justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
distinguish
in
response
to
justice
o'connor
the
custody
case
from
the
deprivation
permanently
of
parental
status
on
the
basis
of
the
permanence
of
the
latter.
well,
what
about
establishing
parental
relationship?
what
about
paternity
proceedings?
suppose
there's
a
finding
of
paternity
in
a
district,
in
a
lower
court,
is
the
defendant
in
that
case,
by
your
reasoning,
because
of
the
permanence
of
that
determination,
entitled
to
a
free
transcript?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
that,
let's
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
just
that
it
was
shown
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
not
clear
and
convincing,
because
as
far
as
i
know,
clear
and
convincing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
not
required
to
establish
paternity,
and
then
the
defendant
says,
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
will
have
to
support
this
child,
whatever
rights
a
child
has
under
the
law,
those
rights
i
will
have
to
satisfy,
and
i
don't
want
that
for
the
rest
of
my
life,
so
give
me
a
free
transcript.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
would
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
if
we
hold
for
you,
then
when
the
next
case
is
paternity,
we
have
to
hold
that
too?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
made
an
analogy
to
the
criminal
proceeding
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
the
person,
so
you
said
what...
you're
really
asking
for
an
extension
of
the
griffin
line.
i
think
that's
what
you
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
deprivation
of
parental
status
is
as
severe
as
a
$250
fine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
go
all
the
way,
because
griffin
and
douglas
came
together,
and
i
think
you
are
recognizing
that
right
to
counsel
is
not
something
that
would
be
automatic.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
that
you
weren't
sure
about
the
paternity
situation.
is
there...
and
you
are
attempting
to
distinguish
all
other
civil
proceedings.
is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
say
is
like
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
hasn't
the
court
already
decided
in
santosky
that
there
is
something
about
depriving
one
of
parental
status
that's
not
like
anything
else,
and
therefore,
instead
of
the
ordinary
preponderance
test,
there
is
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
test?
isn't...
whether
you
agree
with
that
or
not,
it
is
the
precedent
of
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
in
order
to...
why
did
the
court
say
that
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
is
required,
instead
of
the
ordinary
preponderance?
what
was
the
basis
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
be...
what
did
the
court...
why
did
the
court
say
that
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
constitution,
in
order
to
deprive
a
parent
of
parental
status,
the
proof
standard
that
the...
that
must
be
met
is
clear
and
convincing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
the
court
said
that
because
there
is
a
fundamental
interest
at
stake,
that
is,
the
parent-child
relationship
is
a
fundamental
interest...
let's
assume
that's
what
the
court
said,
as
i
think
it
did...
then
the
parent's
loss
at
the
trial
level
doesn't
mean
the
interest
is
changed,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested.
the
interest
remains
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wouldn't
the
same
reasoning
that
supported
the
court's
statement
that
this
higher
standard...
why
do
we
have
clear
and
convincing
as
opposed
to
preponderance
for
these
cases?
what
would
be
the
reason
for
doing
that?
it's
an
extra
check,
right,
because
something
fundamental
is
involved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
appellate
review
is
similarly
an
extra
check.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
isn't
that
what
the
argument
is
here?
you
lessen
the
risk
of
error
by
allowing
the
appeal,
and
the
argument
was
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
meet
this
high
standard
of
proof.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
the
argument
that
was
made,
and
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
petitioner's
brief,
but
i
thought
they
were
saying,
we're
trying
to
bracket
our
case
not
with
boddie
but
with
griffin,
that
we
think
that
the
impact
on
our
client,
permanent
deprivation
of
parental
status,
ought
to
be
treated
the
same
as
a
criminal
conviction,
that
there's
no
other
civil
case
like
that
that
declares
a
woman
a
nonparent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
asked
the
petitioner
that
question,
and
the
answer
was,
there's
only
one
other
thing
that
the
petitioner
would
put
in
that
same
box,
and
that's
civil
commitment,
involuntary
civil
commitment,
so
now
you
want
them...
you
want
to
make
their
argument
something
that
they
are
not
attempting
to
do
with
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
the
paternity
cases
are
concerned,
there's
no...
at
least
the...
in
the
trial
court
there's
no
analogy
to
the
clear
and
convincing
requirement
of
santosky.
i
think
it's
just...
that
has
been
rejected
for
paternity
rights.
there
is
just
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
moore,
isn't
the
paternity
case
more
like
any
civil
case?
i
mean,
what
paternity
is
about
is
money.
you
have
to
pay
to
support
the
child.
you
don't...
they
don't
require
you
to
love
the
child,
to
take
the
child
to
soccer
games.
all
you
have
to
do
is,
if
you're
saddled
with
a
paternity
decree,
is
to
pay
money.
that's
something
of
a
different
quality
than
to
say,
you
have
no
parental
relationship
to
this
child.
you
are
a
stranger
to
the
child
that
you
bore.
that
isn't
about
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
people
don't
want
to
lose
a
damage
suit,
either,
but
all
that's
at
stake
is
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
other
states
that
do
not
provide
a
free
transcript
to
a
poor
person
for
a
deprivation
of
parental
status
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there's
nothing
short
of
a
full
transcript
that
could
be
a
transcript
of
part,
but
mississippi
doesn't
tape
the
proceeding,
does
it,
keep
it
on
audio
tape?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that
wouldn't
exclude
also
having
an
audio
tape.
but
you're
telling
me
they
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
one
other
question
of
mississippi
proceedings.
is
what
happened
here
the
norm?
that
is,
all
the
evidence
comes
in,
and
then
the
judge
makes
a
kind
of
a
boilerplate
judgment,
repeating
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
says,
i
have
found
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
this
parent
is
unfit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
from
your
experience
in
the
state,
what
is
the
usual?
is
this
typical,
what
we've
seen
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
are
you
saying
that
when
the
other
parent
petitions
to
have
a
parent
declared
unfit,
there's
less
protection
than
when
the
state
does
it?
the...
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
get
the
protection
that
she
would
have
gotten
if
the
state
itself,
rather
than
her
former
husband,
had
initiated
the
proceedings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
remove
a
child
from
a
home
without
depriving
a
parent
of
parental
status.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were
explaining
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
right
of
the
petitioner
why
she
is
entitled
to
less
process
when
it's
her
ex-husband
than
when
it's
the
state
that
is
trying
to
deprive
her
of
parental
status.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
modify
the
decree
to
provide
for
visitation
rights,
which
might
not
have
been...
custody
decrees
are
modifiable,
is
that
not
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
a
deprivation
of
parental
status
is
final,
not
modifiable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
boddie
is...
or
boddie,
i
don't
know
how
to
pronounce
it--
--it's
two
d's.
--is
a
different...
however
that
comes
out,
it's
a
different
case
because
those
are
the
people
who
say,
state,
we
want
you
to
pay
for
our
divorce,
we
want
something
from
you,
where
here
the
woman
is
saying,
please
don't
take
my
child
away.
she's
not
coming
to
the
court
asking
for
anything.
she
just
wants
to
be
spared
from
the
state
taking
away
her
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
two
cases
seem
to
me
quite
distinct.
however
you
would
come
out
in
boddie
or
boddie,
it's
not
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
a
poor
person’s
opportunity
to
challenge
on
appeal
a
court
decree
ending
her
status
as
a
parent.
the
petitioner,
m.l.b.
had
two
children,
a
boy
born
in
1985,
a
girl
in
1987.
in
1994,
on
the
application
of
m.l.b.’s
former
husband
and
his
second
wife,
a
chancery
court
in
mississippi
decreed
m.l.b.,
an
unfit
parent,
terminated
her
parental
rights,
and
approved
adoption
of
the
children
by
their
stepmother.
the
trial
judge
declared
that
the
statutory
requirements
for
parental
status
termination
had
been
met
but
he
did
not
specify
concretely
the
evidence,
facts,
or
precise
reasons
for
his
decision.
m.l.b.
sought
to
appeal
and
paid
the
$100
filing
fee
but
under
mississippi
laws,
she
could
not
perfect
her
appeal
without
paying
at
once
an
amount
exceeding
$2300
for
preparation
of
the
record.
the
law,
just
part
of
that
cost
was
for
a
transcript
of
the
chancery
court
proceedings.
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
denied
m.l.b.’s
request
for
permission
to
appeal
without
pre
payment
of
cost.
mississippi
courts
granted
such
applications
only
for
appeals
from
two
categories
of
judgments,
criminal
convictions
and
involuntary
civil
commitment
orders.
m.l.b.
tenders
this
question,
may
a
state,
consistent
with
the
eue
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
render
appellate
review
of
parental
termination
decrees
accessible
only
to
parents
who
have
the
ware
withhold
to
pay
for
a
transcript
plus
other
record
preparation
fees.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
and
hold
that
mississippi
may
not
deny
m.l.b.
because
of
her
poverty,
her
inability
to
pay
for
a
transcript,
access
to
appellate
review
to
test
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
on
which
she
was
judged
unfit
to
remain
a
parent.
our
opinion
surveys
the
court’s
prior
decisions
and
points.
we
take
up
first
appeals
from
criminal
convictions
including
convictions
for
petty
offenses,
penalized
by
fine
but
not
incarceration.
in
all
cases
typed
criminal
or
quasi-criminal
in
nature,
our
prior
decisions
hold
that
a
state
may
not
bolt
the
door
to
a
poor
person's
appeal
by
withholding
the
record
necessary
for
appellate
review.
on
the
other
hand,
we
next
point
out,
in
most
civil
cases,
our
prior
rulings
established
that
the
state
need
not
permit
poor
persons
to
appeal
free
of
charge.
today’s
decision
also
reviews
our
case
law
recognizing
that
no
ties
are
more
precious
than
those
binding
parent
and
child,
and
that
few
decrees,
also
grave
in
their
consequences
as
a
court
order
permanently
severing
the
parent-child
bond.
parental
termination
decrees,
our
prior
decision
acknowledged
work
a
unique
kind
of
deprivation
unlike
custody
decrees,
they
totally
destroy
all
legal
recognition
of
a
parent-child
relationship.
we
therefore
distinguish
m.l.b.’s
case
from
the
mind
run
of
civil
actions
including
other
domestic
relations
matters
and
align
it
for
appeal
access
purposes
with
criminal
and
petty
offense
cases.
the
accusatory
state
action
m.l.b.
seeks
defend
off,
we
explain,
should
not
be
obscured
by
the
label
civil
action
where
parental
unfitness
judications
are
barely
distinguishable
from
criminal
condemnation
in
view
of
the
magnitude
and
permanence
of
the
laws
at
state.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
scalia;
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joining
all
but
part
two
of
justice
thomas’
dissenting
opinion.
