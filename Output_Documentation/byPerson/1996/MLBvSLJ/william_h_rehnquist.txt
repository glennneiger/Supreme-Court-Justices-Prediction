chief
justice

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-853,
m.l.b.
v.
s.l.j.--
mr.
mcduff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
mr.
mcduff,
considering
her
claim,
what
do
you
suggest
would
be
the
factors
that
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
would
take
into
consideration
if
it
were
to
"consider
it",
as
you
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
they
were
to
conclude
that
her
income
were
too
poor,
were
below
whatever
standard--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--then
they
would
have
to
allow
the...
require
this
money
be
paid
to
the
court
reporter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
reporter
is
going
to
have
to
be
paid
in
any
event,
i
take
it.
if
your
client
doesn't
pay
him
the
state
is
going
to
have
to...
it's
not
the
sort
of
a
fee
that
the
state
could
simply
waive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
reason
he
takes
the
job
is
because
of
his
access
to
these
out...
these
transcripts,
is
it
not?
at
least,
that
was
my
experience
with
court
reporters.
you
wouldn't
hire...
they
wouldn't
come
to
work
just
for
the
fees
they
get
for
sitting
in
court.
it's
the
transcripts
on
which
they
make
their
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
were
criminal
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
much--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
much
weight
do
we
give
to
this
exclusive
method
for
termination?
in
many
states
the
only
way
to
foreclose
on
one's
home
is
by
a
court
proceeding,
a
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage.
now,
would
you
distinguish
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
person
says,
this
home
is
absolutely
essential
to
me.
i'm
raising
my
kids
in
it,
and
if
i
lose
it,
it
means
my
whole
family
life
goes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
make
that
argument
without
a
transcript.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
client
had
succeeded
in
raising
the
money
to
pay
the...
for
the
transcript,
could
she
have...
and
was
successful
on
appeal,
could
she
have
recovered
that
as
part
of
her
costs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
court...
that
courts
could
employ
reporters
at
the
same
salaries
if
they
weren't
allowed
to
charge
for
transcripts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mcduff.
mr.
moore.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mathews
really
doesn't
address
the
question
of
when
you
should
have
an
attorney,
does
it?
it's
more
the
type
of
hearing
you
should
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
that
would
have
been
true
in
ross
v.
moffitt,
too,
where
you
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
highest
court
of
a
state
from
the
decision
of
an
intermediate
court
of
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
proceeding
in
mississippi
in
connection
with
an
appeal
where
there
would
be
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
at
least
by
that
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
circuit
judges
are
there
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
this
case
the
complainant,
the
petitioner
was
already
a
noncustodial
parent,
was
she
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
it
wasn't
as
if
the
custody
was
taken
away
from
her.
it
already
had
been.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
moore.
mr.
mcduff,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcduff--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that
was
the
rationale
of
boddie,
that
divorce
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
cutting
off
a
parental
relation
is
a
"fundamental"
interest,
and
a
right
to
get
a
divorce
is
high,
but
not
fundamental?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcduff.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-853,
m.l.b.
versus
s.l.j.
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
