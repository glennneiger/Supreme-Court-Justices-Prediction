justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
go
back--
--can
i
ask
you--
--please.
--just
a
sort
of
variation
of
justice
kennedy's
question.
in
the
lassiter
case,
the
court
refused
to
hold
that
a
person
like
your
client
is
entitled
in
all
cases
to
counsel,
but
did
indicate
on
a
case-by-case
basis
counsel
might
be
required
in
some
situations.
supposing
in
this
case,
instead
of
a
one-line
order
rejecting
your
claim,
the
trial
judge
had
made
detailed
findings
of
fact
saying
that
he
relied
on
the
testimony
of
so-and-so
to
the
effect
of
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
he
gave
a
very
careful
opinion
and
analysis
of
the
reasons,
and
you
could
tell
what
the
basis
of
the
decision
was
and
what
the
evidentiary
support
for
it
was.
would
you
still
say
you
were
entitled
to
counsel
in
that
situation...
i
mean,
entitled
to
a
transcript
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
i
feel
about
it,
essentially.
read
the
opinions.
[laughter]
mr.
mcduff,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
mississippi
practice?
who
paid
the
guardian
ad
litem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
client
was
charged
$500
for
the
guardian
ad
litem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
the
guardian
was
paid
by
the
successful
party.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you...
go
ahead.
could
the
guardian
have
appealed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
who
would
have
paid
for
the
cost
of
the
transcript
if
the
guardian
had
appealed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
guardian
certainly
doesn't
have
any
interest
in
paying
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
an...
i'm
sorry,
just
one
more.
this
is
an
infant,
two
or
three...
how
old
was
the
child
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
the
child
has
to
be
represented
separately
in
the
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
a
matter
of
due
process,
too,
i
would
suppose,
because
the
child's
rights
are
as
vitally
affected
as
either
set
of
parents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
the
statute
does
require
it,
and
what
is
the...
and
therefore
there
has
to
be
a
guardian
ad
litem
appointed
if
the
child
is
a
minor,
and
what
if
the
guardian...
i
know
it's...
it
would
be
an
unusual
case,
but
what
if
the
guardian
took
the
position
that
the
natural
mother
was
a
better
parent
and
wanted
to
appeal
an
adverse
decision,
would
the
guardian
have
to
advance
the
transcript
cost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
interest
of
justice
required,
in
this
unusual
case
the
judge
might
conceivably
order
the
state
to
pay
the...
order
a
transcript
if
the
guardian
indicated
a
desire
to
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
paternity
cases
the
issue
is
pretty
well
determined
by
scientific
evidence
now,
isn't
it,
rather...
you
have
a
rather
narrow
actual
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
this
case
could
be
a
law
and
record
case,
where
you
believe
some
witnesses
and
you
don't
believe
others,
and
all
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
your
rule
would
apply
even
if
that
were
the
argument.
even
if
the
petitioner
was
arguing
the
judge
wouldn't
let
us
put
on
any
witnesses.
she
still
couldn't
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
in
this
case,
but
if
it
were
a
case
in
which
the
mother
claimed
that
the
judge
wouldn't
listen
to
me,
he
wouldn't
let
me
put
on
any
evidence,
and
he
entered
his
order
without
any
evidence
at
all,
she
still
couldn't
appeal,
even
if
she
made
those
arguments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
can
she
establish
what
happened
at
that
trial
if
she
doesn't
have
a
transcript?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
state
statute
required
the
full
transcript.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ah,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
if
the
challenge
is
that
the
trial
or
the
judge
was
biased,
or
something
like
that...
well,
but
even
then,
i
suppose
you
might
need
the
transcript
to
establish
that.
but
you're
saying
if
the
error
is
one
that
can
be
established
without
a
transcript,
she
could
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
didn't
miss
something.
in
that
situation,
does
the
state
provide
the
transcript,
when
the
state
initiates
the
termination
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
still
doesn't.
so...
i
don't...
what
is
the
difference
between
that
proceeding
and
this
in
terms
of
state
procedural
protections?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
risk
of
error
present
in
a
case
like
this
is
that
the
trial
judge
naturally
would
be
influenced
by
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
and
therefore
would
tend
to
give
custody
to
the
adopting
parents,
and
not
apt
to
make
detailed
findings
about
unfitness
of
the
mother
whose
rights
are
being
terminated.
the
termination
is
a
condition
precedent
to
the
adoption
in
all
these
cases,
i
guess.
