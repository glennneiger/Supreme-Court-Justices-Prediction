justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
find
that
the
equal
protection
argument
you
make
is
unavailing,
that
is
to
say
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
make
this
distinction,
does
that
not
necessarily
determine
also
the
invalidity
of
your
due
process
argument?
i
mean,
i
take
it
you're
making
a
due
process
argument
as
well
as
an
equal
protection
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
basically
asking,
is
there
a
difference
between
the
two?
once
we
have
said
that
it's
not...
i'm
assuming
we
said
that
it's
not
unreasonable
to
make
that
distinction.
wouldn't
the
due
process
argument
fail
as
well,
or
would
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
we've
said
it's
reasonable
for
equal
protection
purposes,
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
the
real
problem
with
this
case
that
the
judge
didn't
give
reasons,
the
trial
judge,
and
did
you
preserve
that
as
an
independent
ground
for
alleging
a
constitutional
violation
at
any
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
judge
just
doesn't
give
a
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
not
making
that
argument
here.
that's
a
separate,
independent
constitutional
violation,
a
failure
to
give
reasons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
instances,
or
are
there
instances
in
which
the
state
does
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
transcript?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pardon
me,
in
a
civil
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
wrong
for
the
court
to
say
that
a
guardian
is
entitled
to
an
attorney,
the
child
is
entitled
to
an
attorney
as
an
equal
protection
matter
because
a
fundamental
right
is
implicated
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
counsel
were
required
in
a
termination
proceeding
such
as
this,
and
the
court
announced
that
the
requirement
was
pursuant
to
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
case
of
an
indigent
party,
would
that
be
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
law?
i
mean,
i.e.,
it
would
be
an
alternative,
alternative
ground
for...
to
due
process,
to
mathews
v.
eldridge.
is
it
illogical
to
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
the
child.
you
said
it
was
required
under
mathews
v.
eldridge
that
there
had
to
be
an
attorney.
my
only
question
is,
would
it
also
be
a
requirement
under
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
case
of
an
indigent
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
required
by
mathews
v.
eldridge--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
have
an
attorney,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
due
process,
no
due
process
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
establish
that
the...
that
this
is
a
fundamental
right,
fundamental
relation.
then
the
equal
protection
differential
here
between
those
who
can
get
the
transcript
and
those
who
cannot
does
in
one
sense
impinge
on
the
fundamental
right,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
have
to
do
a
gradation,
or
then
boddie
is
going
to
come
out
the
same
way
as
your
case,
isn't
it,
and
we'll
have
transcripts
in
all
divorce
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
i
take
it
was
the
thrust
of
the
chief
justice's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
i
think
you
have
to
have
a
hierarchy,
or
a
gradation.
