how
about
a
custody
proceeding,
a
child
custody
proceeding?
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
if
she
had
lost
in
a
custody
battle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
custody
order
doesn't
provide
for
visitation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
going
to
turn
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
a
principle
line
can
be
drawn--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--between
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
case
and
a
custody
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
harris
v.
mcrae,
where
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
medically
necessary
abortion
for
an
indigent
woman?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
considered,
i
thought
the
circumstances
were
that
it
was
medically
necessary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
do
you
concede
that
a
fundamental
right
is
at
issue
here
in
the
case
when
you
deprive
a
parent
by
state
action
of
parental
rights?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
know
why
the
interest
wouldn't
remain
the
same
throughout
the
proceeding.
it's
either
fundamental
or
it
isn't,
and
maybe
some
heightened
scrutiny
is
required
of
procedures
that
the
state
invokes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
how
many
of
those
involve
termination
of
parental
rights?
