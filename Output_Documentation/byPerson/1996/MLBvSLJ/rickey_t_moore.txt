mr.
rickey
t.
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
state
is
going
to
have
to
subsidize
the
cost
of
appeal
of
an
indigent
appealing
termination
of
parental
rights,
and
we
contend
that
it
does
not
either
on
due
process
or
equal
protection
grounds.
from
a
due
process
point
of
view,
previous
longstanding
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
that
appellate
review
is
not
necessary
for
due
process
purposes,
and
as
to
the
equal
protection
claim,
this
doesn't
fit
within
any
of
the
recognized
equal
protection
type
claims.
first
of
all,
there's
no
disparate
treatment
among
litigants.
everybody's
treated
the
same.
everybody's
required
to
prepay
the
cost
of
the
appeal.
second,
there's
no
suspect
class
involved,
because
previous
opinions
of
this
court
have
held
that
the
poor
are
not
a
suspect
class
for
equal
protection
purposes
even
when
fundamental
rights
are
involved.
and
third,
there's
no
impingement
of
a
fundamental
right
in
this
case
because
the
only
interference
with
the
parent-child
relationship
is
the
statute
that
allows
the
state
to
terminate
parental
rights
under
certain
circumstances.
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
what
procedural
due
process
must
be
provided
prior
to
that
termination,
and
that
either
goes
back
to
a
mathews
analysis
of
whether
or
not
the
proceedings
that
are
provided
are
fundamentally
fair,
and
then
it
would
seem
the
question--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
the
statute
requires--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--that
is
unclear.
the
guardian
is
paid
pursuant
to
the...
a
rule,
i
think
it's
rule
17
of
the
appellate
procedures,
and
there
is
some
statements
about
the
trial
judge
being
able
to
enter
any
other
orders,
which
might
imply
there
might
be
a
possibility,
if
the
trial
judge
decided
that
that
was
in
the
best--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--well,
i
think
it
simply...
it's
unclear.
it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
an
argument
to
that
effect,
but
as
to
whether
or
not
that
would
be
accepted,
i
don't
know.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't...
i
didn't
get
the
question.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
if
you're
asking,
if
the
court
had
ordered
an
attorney
be
appointed
for
the
mother,
or
the
child,
then--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--no,
what
i
was
saying
is,
the
attorney
is...
has
to
be
appointed
for
the
child
based
on
the
statute,
the
mississippi
statutes
that
deal
with
termination.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
no.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
no.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
no.
i
think
that's
the
lassiter
case,
or...
well,
lassiter
leaves
it
open
for
a
potential
in
certain
circumstances
based
on
the
balancing
test
that
an
attorney
might
be
required.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
right.
mathews
is
just
whether
or
not
fundamental
fairness
is
met,
and
whether
or
not--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--additional
safeguards
have
to
be
provided.
i
also
think
that
case
assumes
that
fundamental
fairness
can
be
met
at
the
trial
court
level,
and
that
an
appeal
is
not
required,
which
is
consistent
with
the
older
cases
saying
that
appellate
review
is
not
required
for
due
process
purposes.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
we
would
concede
that
the
parent-child
relationship
in
the
past
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
a
fundamental
interest.
however,
in
this
case
we
question
whether
or
not
there
is
a
fundamental
right
at
this
point
in
the
proceedings,
and
that's
because
at
this
point
in
all
of
these
proceedings
there
is
a
judgment
by
a
state
trial
court
terminating
this
person's
parental
rights,
and
based
on
the
line
of
cases
that
deal
with...
stanley
v.
illinois,
and
the
quillion
case,
and
lehrer
case
dealing
with
biological
parents,
it
seems
to
indicate
that
parental
conduct
determines
parental
interest,
and
it
would
seem
at
this
point
that
her
interest
would
be
at
least
less
than
fundamental.
we
don't
know
what
they
are,
but
it
would
be--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--well,
the
argument
is
based,
again,
on
those...
the
biological
father
cases,
and
it
seems
like
at
this
point--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--yes,
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
but
santosky
is
talking
about
in
the
trial
itself.
it--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--well,
it
may
be
the
greater
interest,
i'm
not
arguing
with
that,
in
the
trial
stage,
but
what
i'm
arguing--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--i
assume
that
the
interest
were
considered
somewhat
more
than
the
normal.
i
don't
remember
specifically
from
the
case
whether
or
not
it
specifically
deals
with
that.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
well,
again,
my
argument
is
based
on
those
line
of
cases
that
talk
about
the
biological
connection
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
raise
any
interest,
and
the
parent's
conduct
determines
that,
so
when
you
have
a
trial
court
determining
that
the
conduct
of
the
parent
is
such
that
the
parental
right
should
be
terminated,
then
it
would
seem
like
at
that
point
the
presumption
of
a
fundamental
right
might
be
lessened,
at
least.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes,
i
believe--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--i
believe
the
higher
standard
is...
within
the
case
was
to
lessen
the
risk
of
error.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
theoretically,
any
appeal
would
be
designed
to
lessen
the
risk
of
error,
an
appeal
of
any
case.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes,
that...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
i
would
disagree
with
that,
because
i
think
that
it's
not
an
impingement
of
the
parent-child
relationship,
and
it's
certainly
not
a
direct
and
substantial
impingement,
which
the
zablocki
case
and
others
require
for
this
kind
of
constitutional
violation.
it's
purely
the
procedural
matter
as
to
what
procedures
they're
entitled
to,
and
in
the
procedural
analysis
in
the
mathews
case,
the
interest
of
the
parent
is
taken
into
consideration
in
the
first
part
of
that
balancing
test.
we've
taken
the
position
that
in
effect
what
petitioner
is
doing
here
is
either
attempting
to
extend
boddie
v.
connecticut
to
the
appellate
level,
or
attempting
to
find
an
exception
to
the
ortwein
case
and,
based
on
their
arguments,
they
seem
to
be
making
a
purely
wealth
disparity
argument
which
would
potentially
bring
in
all
cases
of
a
civil
nature,
especially
those
involving
rights
that
have
been
determined
to
be
a--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--well,
i
think
based
on
the
use
of
the
griffin
case
and
what
they're
arguing
for
the
rights,
it's
very
hard
to
distinguish
between
fundamental
rights
at
that
point,
so
you
get
into
a
situation
of
having
to
kind
of
do
a
hierarchy
of
fundamental
rights
and
then
decide
where
you
cut
off
the
appeals
and
where
you
don't.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
i'm
saying
that
that
argument
would
be
very
hard
to
implement.
i
think
it
implicates
other
things.
it
would
be
very
hard
as
a
practical
matter
to
separate
the
one
from
the
other
interest.
the
result
of
this
would
be,
i
think,
that
other
courts
would
end
up
interpreting
this
to
include
other
fundamental
rights
and
other
important
rights,
and
in
that
regard,
in
the
1995
in
the
state
of
mississippi
there
were
almost
40,000
domestic
relation
cases
filed
in
the
lower
courts,
so
if
they
were
expanded--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--there
were
194
of
these
parental
rights
cases.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
and
there
were
a
little
over
6,000
paternity
cases,
and
that's
compared
to
a
little
over
15,000
criminal
cases.
it's
our
contention
that
there--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--i
don't
recall
on
that,
but
the
paternity
cases
are
kind
of
mirror
images
of
the
termination
cases.
just
like
in
boddie,
the
fundamental
right
is
a
right
to
marry,
but
it
involves
a
divorce,
so
it
would
be
hard
to
separate
the
two.
i
don't
see
how
you
could
separate
the
two.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
a
lot
of
those,
as
i
understand,
probably
go
off
on...
on
the
test.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
if
the
tests
come
back
positive,
then
the
potential
father
admits
it
and
doesn't
fight
it,
so--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--well,
i
think,
though,
from
a
paternity
point
of
view
it's
just
the
opposite,
i
guess,
the...
in
the
sense
that
the
person
who
is
in
the
paternity
case
doesn't
want
to
be
determined
to
be
the
father.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
well,
there's
also
the
creation
of
a
legal
relationship
against
the
will
of
the
individual
as
well.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes,
your
honor,
there's
other
social
stigmas,
or
whatever,
that
would
be
associated
with
it.
there's
also,
as
far
as
the
trial
itself
goes,
we've
said
that
this
is
a
fundamentally
fair
proceeding
that
are
had
in
these
cases,
and
it's
in
a
state
trial
court
in
front
of
the
judge,
who's
trained
in
the
law.
the
parties
are
allowed
to
submit
evidence,
and
witnesses,
and
documents,
and
allowed
to
cross-examine,
and
redirect,
and
direct
examination
of
witnesses,
and
there's
nothing
been
suggested
by
the
petitioner
in
here
that
these
are
not
fundamentally
fair
proceedings
and
meet
the
requirements--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--no,
she
could,
in
that
regard.
this
case
involves,
as
was
mentioned
earlier...
the
claim
here
on
the
appeal
is,
it's
not
based
on
substantial
evidence.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
you
don't
need
a
transcript
for
that
appeal.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
the
rule
that
requires
the
transcript
in
this
particular
case
only
requires
the
whole
transcript
when
the
issue
is
raised
here.
but
other
than
that,
all
you
need
is
sufficient
information
to
raise
the
issue
that
you
have,
and
you
can
either
do
that
by,
in
this
particular
case
by
agreement
of
counsel
as
to
what
happened,
or
potentially
it
might
take
one
page
of
the
transcript,
when
the
judge
refused
to
let
her
cross-examine
witnesses,
or
submit
witnesses.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
no,
only
when
the
appeal
is
based
on
lack
of
substantial
evidence.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
then
the
court
has
to
have
all
of
it
to
make
the
determination.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes.
if
it
could
be
established
without
the
transcript
she
could
certainly
appeal,
and
in
other
cases,
as
i
said,
it
might
not
take
but
two
or
three
pages
of
the
transcript.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
that's
the
only
time
the
rule
or
the
statute
says
that--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--you
have
to
have
a
full
transcript.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
almost
all
of
these
appeals
will
be
where
they
require
the
entire
transcript,
because
they're
based
on
lack
of
substantial
evidence.
it
would
be
unusual
for
a
claim
that
a
state
trial
court
doesn't
provide
a
fundamentally
fair
proceeding,
based
on
the
procedures
used.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
i
don't
know
specifically
on
that.
i
know
there
are
some
citations
in
petitioner's
brief
about
states
that
do.
i
don't
think
they
cite
all
of
the
states
as
doing
that,
though.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
no.
the
proceeding
would
be
taken
by
a
court
reporter.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
it
wouldn't
exclude
it,
but
i
would
doubt
if
there
are
any
court
reporters
still
using
audio
tapes.
i
don't
know
that.
i
mean,
there
could
be
an
individual
court
reporter
somewhere
that
did
that,
but
i
wouldn't
think
so
now.
the
state's
interest
in
this
include
other
things
beside
the
cost--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--i
think
the
order
of
the
judge
in
any
individual
case
will
be
dependent...
depend
on
that
judge.
there's
not
any--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--i
don't
know.
i
haven't
tried
any
of
these
cases
actually
in--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--no,
i
don't.
there
are
82
counties,
but
as
far
as
actual
numbers
of
circuit
judges,
i
don't
know.
i
would
point
out
that
in...
when
the
state
is
involved
in
actually
prosecuting
a
termination,
there
are
additional
safeguards
that
take
place
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
the
chancery
court,
and
all
of
those
occur
in
the
youth
court,
and
involve
at
least
four
hearings,
three
of
which
are
judicial
in
nature,
at
which
the
parent
is
allowed
to
attend
with
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
participate,
and
that
the
rights
are
not
terminated
of
the
parent
until
there
have
been
all
of
these
procedural
safeguards
taken,
and
usually
it's
at
least
a
year
after
the
child
has
been
taken
out
of
the
custody
of
the
parents.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes.
the
proceedings
are
viewed...
when
the
state
itself
prosecutes
a
termination,
then
it's
viewed
as
a
little
different,
because
what
you're
doing
there
is
coming
in
and
eventually
terminating
the
right
of
the
parent
so
that
the
child
can
be
adopted
by
what
ends
up
being
strangers,
nonrelatives,
and
it
arises
here
because
it's
absolutely
necessary
that
the
state,
the
department
of
human
services
go
in
and
remove
the
child
from
the
home
because
of
potential
abuse
or--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--well,
it's
not
always
done
when
the
state
does
it.
it's
when
it
becomes
necessary.
there
are
several
things
that
the
state
goes
through
with
the...
an
analysis
of
whether
or
not
it
should
be
brought,
obviously
children
that
are
taken
out,
that
it's
unfeasible
to
put
them
back
in
the
home,
some
of
them
may
be
14
or
15
or
16--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--well,
the
state
is
simply
set
up
for
the
state
because
of
the
unique
situation
that
the
state
is
in,
so
in
essence
more
process
is
provided
because
of
that
particular
situation,
that
the
state
is
coming
in
and
taking
the
child.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
no.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
just
that
this
is
done
in
youth
court
before
a...
an
action
would
be
filed
in
chancery
court
to
actually
terminate.
there's
no
termination
that
takes
place
in
the
youth
court.
it's
only
judging
the
status
of
the
child
and
being
able
to
take
the
child
out
of
a
bad
situation
if
necessary.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
she
had
lost
her
custody
of
the
children
at
the
time
of
the
divorce,
and
this
was
sometime
later
when
the
proceedings
to
terminate
her
rights
were
brought.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
well,
certainly
a
parent
could
go
back
in
and
attempt
to
petition
to
change
custody,
that's
true.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
yes,
the
termination
would
be...
i
guess
like
any
other
civil
case,
once
the
time
runs
for
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
something,
that
it
would
be
final,
just
like
any
other
case.
it
would
be
res
judicata,
probably,
from
a--
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
--the
termination
is
precedent
to
the
adoption.
mr.
rickey
t.
moore
i
would
disagree
with
what
the
trial
judge
would
do,
because
i
think
trial
judges
take
these
things
very
seriously,
and
i
don't
think
that
they
would
terminate
the
mother's
rights,
regardless
of
the
situation,
unless
they
felt
it
was
absolutely
justified
based
on
the
evidence
that's
presented.
in
conclusion,
what
the
petitioner
is
apparently
attempting
to
do
here
is
create
a
vast
new
constitutional
right
and
further
federalize
domestic
relations
law,
and
we
submit
that
that
shouldn't
be
done
in
the
absence
of
clear
constitutional
violation,
and
we
further
submit
that
there's
been
no
showing
or
evidence
that
a
clear
constitutional
violation
exists
in
this
case.
thank
you.
