justice
david
h.
souter
you
think
that's
right?
and
why
is
that?
yes,
i
was
about
to
ask,
why--
--why
is
that?
why
doesn't
it
have
the
same
constitutional
magnitude?
it
sounds
important
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
want
to
take
that
as
a
general
rule,
that
whenever
the
constitution
is
said
to
impose
a
higher
burden
of
proof,
that
the
right
to
sort
of
economic
equality
in
the
vindication
of
one's
position
is
going
to
follow?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
so
far
as
the
issue
before
us--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
concerned
you
are.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not
counsel?
why
shouldn't
she
be
entitled,
if
this
is
that
significant,
to
have
counsel
on
the
appeal?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
other
is
the
question
whether
you
really
come
within
the
rule
of
the
due
process
cases,
because
i
thought
the
rule
in
the
due
process
cases
was
that
the
state
could
not
on
one
side
of
it's...
from
one
side
of
it's
mouth
say,
you
have
a
right
to
an
appeal
here,
you're
entitled
to
be
in
court,
and
on
the
other
hand
say,
but
aha,
there
is
some
barrier
which
we
are
erecting
which
precludes
you
from
taking
advantage
of
this
appeal
right.
here,
what
the
state
is
saying
is,
nobody
without
the
cost
of
a
transcript,
or
nobody
without
a
transcript
in
his
hand,
has
a
right
to
appeal.
it's
a
condition
precedent
for
the
appellate
right
in
the
first
place.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
you're
not
within
the
due
process
cases
reasoning,
and
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
stand
or
fall
on
equal
protection.
