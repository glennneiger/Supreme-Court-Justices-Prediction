it
could
abolish
appeals,
alternatively,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
suggests,
you
know,
if
the
greater
includes
the
lesser
we
can
abolish
the
appeal
entirely,
why
can't
it
simply
provide,
we'll
give
appeals,
but
not
if
the
state
has
to
put
in
any
money,
and
we're
not
going
to
give
it
to
impecunious
litigants?

payment
is
an
arbitrary
fashion?
i
mean,
gee,
so
much
of
what
happens
in
the
world
is
determined
upon
whether
you
can
pay
for
it
or
not.
why
is
that
an
arbitrary
fashion?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
if
i
am...
let's
say
i
am
dismissed
by
an
employer
allegedly
for
sexual
abuse
of
a
child
committed
to
my
care
as
an
employee,
my
reputation
is
ruined,
i
pay
millions
of
dollars
in
damages
in
a
civil
suit,
i
am
unemployable
in
the
future,
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
the
state
would
not
have
to
pay
for
an
appeal?

justice

i'm
just
asking
whether
it's
true,
is
what
i'm
asking.
justice
antonin

it's

not
just
that
we
said

that
it's

justice

mr.
mcduff,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
is
the
difference
between
a
decree
of
nonparenthood,
as
in
this
case,
and
a
decree
as
sometimes
occurs
in
cases
of
no
visitation
rights,
no
custody
and
no
visitation
rights?
what
does
this
individual
lose
that
a
parent
who
is
denied
custody
and
visitation
rights
doesn't
lose?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
happen
here.
just
because
the
state
declares
you're
a
nonparent
doesn't
mean
you
vanish.
i
assume
you
could
still--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
same
as
no
custody
and
no
visitation
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask--
--why
is
that
the
line?
what
if
i
feel
differently?
what
if
i
feel
it's
really
bad,
and
maybe
even
worse
for
some
people
to
lose
all
their
worldly
possessions?
how
do
i
decide
which
cases
to...
just
my
feeling
about
parenthood,
or
my
feeling
about
worldly
possessions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
here
then,
so
i
don't
know
what
they
did.
[laughter]
i
thought
maybe
you
could
help
me
out
as
to
how
we
came
to
those
conclusions.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
a...
i
mean,
it
could
certainly
ruin
the
reputation
of
someone
who
is
decreed
to
be
the
father
of
a
child
whose
father
he
claims
not
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
transcript
is
only
required...
apart
from
the
practicality
of
her
being
able
to
establish
bias,
for
example,
without
the
whole
transcript,
she
could
claim
bias
and
get
an
appeal
without
the
transcript.
the
transcript
is
only
required
by
statute
when
substantiality
of
the
evidence
is
at
issue,
right,
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
she
can
go
up
without
one
for
everything
else,
even
though
for
some
of
those
she
may
not
win
without
the
transcript.
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter.
you
don't
have
to
concede
that.
why
doesn't
that
cut
in
favor
of
the
other
side?
i
mean,
it
won't
cost
the
state
much
money
then.
i
mean,
in
most
cases
she'll
be
able
to
afford
the
$6,
and
if
she
really
couldn't
afford
the
$6,
i
mean,
if
that
was
true,
she
really
couldn't
afford
it,
it
costs
the
state
$6,
not
a
big
deal.
i
mean,
so
it
isn't
much
burden
on
the
state,
almost
no
burden.
it
means
a
lot
to
her.
have
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
say,
weed
out
the
baddies,
you
know,
no
claim.
what's
the
major
problem
for
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
friend
says
that
that
can
be
changed,
whereas
this
can't
be
changed.
now,
is
that
accurate?
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
divorce?
that's
final.
it
deals
with
status.
should
we
apply
the
same
rule
to
a
divorce
decree
that
you're
asserting
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
let's
assume
it's
not
a
no-fault
divorce
kind
of
state.
your
reason
has
to
be
established.
the
other
person
doesn't
want
to
remedy
the
divorce.
the
person
who's
want
it
fully
wants
it.
if
a
state...
i
gather
most
of
the
states,
maybe
all
of
them
now,
have
effectively
no-fault
divorce,
but
let's
assume
a
state
changes
that
and
does
not
have
no-fault
divorce.
i
guess
we
would
have
to
apply
the
same
rule
to
divorce,
wouldn't
we?
if
the
party
unwillingly
divorced
wants
to
appeal,
we
would
have
to
allow
that
appeal
ifp.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
theory
that
children
are
more
important
than
spouses
to
the
individuals
involved,
is
that
the
theory
that
causes
you
to
put
this
on
a
lower
level?
