justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
wonder
if
i'm
just
dead
wrong
on
this.
you
sort
of
treat
all
administrative
expenses
as
fungible.
they
all
could
be
deducted
against
income
or
all
could
be
deducted
against
the
estate
tax.
i
had
thought
that
when
an
estate
is...
includes
a
substantial
asset
as
an
ongoing
business,
that
some
estate
expenses
could
not...
administrative
expenses
could
not
be
deducted
against
the
income
tax
return.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
presumably
the
cost
of
filing
a
will,
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
filing
a
will
or
probate
court
fees,
something
like
that.
it
couldn't
be
deducted
against
the
income
earned
by
the
ongoing
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
necessarily
some
expenses
could
be
deducted
against
income
and
some
could
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
why
i
can't
understand
your
hypothetical
in
your
reply
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
aughtry--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
your
brief
you
gave
us
seven
independent
insufficient
reasons
for
affirming.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
one
would
you
rely
on
if
you
had
to
pick
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
number
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
