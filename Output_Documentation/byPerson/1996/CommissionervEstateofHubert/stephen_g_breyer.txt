so,
if
in
fact
they
have
some
patents
or
something
that
are
worth
$11
million,
but
it
costs
$10
million
to
make
them
valid,
all
they
have
to
do
is
pay
tax,
income
tax,
on
$11
million,
i.e.,
come
up
with
about
$4
million
they
don't
have.
if
they
don't
want
to
do
that,
their
other
alternative
is
that
you
subtract
the
$10
million
which
they
had
to
expend
from
the
estate,
wiping
out
the
value
of
the
estate.
that's
what
seems
unfair
about
it.
it
seems
that
when
they
have
an
awful
lot
of
money
to
spend,
to
make
the
income
really
appear,
they're
forced
to
give
up
either
the
estate--
--we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
mr.
jones.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
that
the
solution
for
the
government,
to
define
more
closely
and
carefully
what
is
the
administrative
expense,
distinguishing
it
quite
clearly
from
those
expenses--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
normally...
in
an
estate
if
suppose
the
person
dies
and
they
have
$10
million
in
assets,
but
they
know
that
$200,000
will
inevitably
be
spent
on
administration,
is
the
value
of
that
estate
$9,800,000
at
date
of
death?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
forget
where
it's
going.
i'm
just
saying
how
do
they
evaluate
an
estate.
if
$10
million
and
we
know
in
advance
$200,000
in
expenses,
is
the
value
at
date
of
death
then
$9.8
million?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
saying
for
purposes
of
tax
is
the
estate
valued
at
$9.8
million?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
we
know
for
sure
there
will
be
$200,000
of
administrative
expenses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
they
evaluate
it
at
$10
million.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
one
question
which
i
think
is...
let's
take
a
normal
estate,
a
smaller
estate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
much...
$2
million.
and
it's
worth
$2
million
at
the
date
of
death
and
everybody
is
sure
there
would
be
$200,000
worth
of
expenses.
i
take
it
under
ordinary
reasoning,
the
widow,
if
it
was
the
man
who
died,
would
get
$1.8
million,
forgetting
other
deductions,
and
they'd
pay
$200,000.
now,
suppose
that's
what
would
happen
normally
and
that
other
$200,000
would
normally
be
deducted
as
a
category
of
administrative
expense.
i'm
right
so
far,
right,
basically?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
suppose
a
martian
comes
along...
a
martian,
somebody
not
related...
and
happens
to
pay
the
$200,000
and
therefore
the
estate
is
now
really
$2
million
instead
of
$1.8
million.
okay,
because
the
wife
now
gets
the
$2
million.
but
i
take
it
their
position
is
that
last
$200,000
came
along
by
purchase.
it
came
along
in
some
other
way.
it
wasn't
obtained
by
the
marital
deduction
portion
of
the
estate,
and
it
seems
to
work
quite
well
and
be
reasonable
in
that
ordinary
case.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
says
that
$200,000
came
through
the
marital
deduction.
they're
saying
it
ended
up
being
part
of
the
estate,
but
it
wasn't
part
of
the
marital
deduction.
that's
what
the
law
is.
it
seems
to
work
well
with
the
small
estate,
and
your
case
i
think
they
would
say
is
a
fluke.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
shouldn't
change
the
law
normally
because
of
your
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
they
concede
that
your
case
is
a
fluke.
they
wouldn't
concede
that
i
realize.
