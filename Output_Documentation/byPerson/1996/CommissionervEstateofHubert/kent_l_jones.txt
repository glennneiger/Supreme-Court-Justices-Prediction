mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
marital
and
charitable
deductions
to
the
federal
estate
tax.
as
with
some
other
tax
cases,
and
perhaps
more
so
than
most,
this
case
involves
the
central
logical
principle
that
is
surrounded
and
almost
obscured
by
a
wealth
of
technical
detail.
i
would
therefore
like
to
focus
first
on
the
central
logical
principle
and
discuss
the
technical
issues
later.
the
gross
estate
is
defined
as
the
value
on
the
date
of
death
of
the
property
owned
by
the
decedent.
the
marital
and
charitable
deductions
to
the
gross
estate
are
defined
by
statute
as
the
value
of
the
property
that
passes
to
the
spouse
and
charity.
when,
as
in
this
case,
the
bequest
left
to
the
spouse
or
charity
is
burdened
by
the
obligation
of
paying
some
expense
or
administration
expense
or
other
claim
against
the
estate,
the
value
of
the
property
that
passes
under
the
bequest
is
obviously
less
than
the
full
face
value
of
the
bequest.
it
is
the
face
value
of
the
bequest,
reduced
by
the
cost
of
satisfying
the
obligations
that
have
been
imposed
on
it.
thus,
in
1963,
this
court
explained
in
united
states
v.
stapf
that
when
the
burden
of
paying
administration
expenses'
or
other
claims
against
the
estate
is
placed
on
the
marital
bequest,
the
decedent
has
in
effect
left
that
portion
of
the
estate
not
to
the
spouse,
but
has
designated
it
for
payment
of
the
claims
of
others.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
was...
actually
if
i
remember
stapf
correctly,
there
was
an
option
given
to
the
heir
as
to
how
to
take
under
the
will
or
not
take
under
the
will,
and
it
dealt
with
the
specifics
of
the
texas
community
property
rules.
in
this--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
nor
does
this
case.
in
this
case,
as
several
courts
have
explained,
the
obligation
to
pay
administration
expenses
is
fixed
on
the
date
of
death.
it
is
about--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--exactly.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
exactly.
it's
the
valuation
of
that
later
on
that
has
to
be
conducted.
but
in
stapf,
the
court
in
speaking
specifically
of
administration
expenses,
said
that
they,
like
claims
against
the
estate,
represent...
i'm
sorry...
when
the
obligation
for
administration
expenses
or
to
pay
claims
against
the
estate
is
placed
on
the
marital
bequest,
that
that
reduces
the
value
of
the
marital
bequest
because
the
decedent
has
in
concept
set
aside
a
portion
of
the
bequest
not
to
go
to
the
spouse,
but
to
someone
else.
and
obviously,
the
portion
of
the
bequest
that's
to
go
to
someone
else
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
marital
deduction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right,
and
to
understand
that,
you
have
to
understand
almost
every
issue
in
the
case,
most
of
which
we
haven't
touched
on
yet,
but
there
is
a
short
answer
to
that.
administration
expenses
are
themselves
a
deduction
under
the
federal
estate
tax
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis
even
though
administration
expenses
may
be
incurred
10
years
later.
we
do
not
make
the
estate
bring
those
expenses
back
to
the
present
value
in
determining
the
administration
expense
deduction
for
the...
now,
if
we
did,
then
it
would
make
some
sense
to
also
bring
back
to
present
value
the
reduction
from
the
marital
deduction
that
occurs
because
of
the
administration
expenses,
but
we
don't
do
either.
we
do
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis
on
administration
expenses.
we
do
a
dollar-for-dollar
reduction
of
the
marital
deduction
to
take
into
account
the
administration
expenses.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absolutely.
this
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
they...
i
think
i
can
give
you
an
example
that
would
suggest,
if
i
understood
your
point,
that
they
are
the
same.
if
you
had
two
alternative
bequests,
the
decedent
calls
you
in
his
study
and
says,
i'm
going
to
let
you
choose.
i'm
writing
a
will
and
here
are
the
choices.
in
both
cases
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
bank
account
with
$100,000
in
it,
and
in
both
cases,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
make
withdrawal
from
those
accounts
for
a
year.
but
in
the
first
case,
the
interest
earned
by
that
account
at
10
percent
is
going
to
be
added
to
it,
so
at
the
end
of
the
year
you
can
withdraw
$110,000,
but
in
the
second
case,
the
interest
earned
by
that
account
is
not
going
to
go
to
you.
it's
going
to
go
to
the
payment
of
administration
expenses.
so,
at
the
end
of
the
year,
you'll
still
just
get
$100,000.
you'd
say,
i
would
like
the
first
bequest
because
the
present
value,
the
real
value,
of
that
bequest
is
higher.
it's
$100,000
on
the
date
of
death.
it's
$110,000
a
year
later.
the
second
bequest,
the
real
value,
as
the
court
said
in
stapf,
is
about
$90,000
because
it...
recognizing
the
time
value
of
money,
if
the
income
is
going
to
be
spent
on
something
else,
the
present
value
of
the
bequest
on
the
date
of
death
is
reduced
by--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
dollar-for-dollar--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
dollar-for-dollar
theory,
as
you
have
described
it,
recognizes
that
this
issue
serves
at
the
border
between
the
estate
tax
and
the
income
tax.
the
estate
tax,
as
i've
tried
to
state
earlier,
allows
the
administration
deduction
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis.
if
that
$10,000
that
i
talked
about
just
a
minute
ago
was
spent
at
the
end
of
the
first
year,
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
that
entire
$10,000
in
valuing
the
estate
if
they...
unless
they
attempted
to
take
that
deduction
on
the
income
tax
return.
normally
these
time
value
of
money
things
aren't
anywhere
near
as
significant
as
they
appear
to
be
in
this
case
because
normally
you
don't
have
a
will
contest
followed
by
a
tax
issue
that
goes
to
the
supreme
court.
normally
we're
talking
about
estates
being
resolved
within
a
year
or
so.
as
a
practical
mechanical
matter--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
estate.
what's
really
turns...
what
extends
the
length
of
the
administration
is
the
nature
of
the
property
i
suppose.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
cost
of
what?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
and
indeed
the
expenses
of
the
ongoing
business
would
not
be
administration
expenses
under
the
estate
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we're
only
talking
here--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
absolutely,
but
let
me--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--let
me
see
if
i
can
help
you.
the
definition
of
administration
expenses
is
in
2053(a)
in
the
regs
under
that,
and
it
lists
the
things
that
you
would
think
of
as
administration
expenses,
arranging
for
the
disposition
of
the
property
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
those
are
the
kinds
of
administration
expenses
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
if
there
was
a
cost
of
running
a
business
after
death
during
the
period
of
administration,
those
would
not
represent
administration
expenses
for
this
purpose.
and
so,
in
my
example,
when
i
said
that
the
will
required
that
the
income
be
used
to
pay
administration
expenses,
i
was
talking
about
those
kinds
of
probate
and
in
this
case
tax...
will
contest,
tax
litigation
expenses
that
relate
to
the
disposition
of
the
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
point
is
that
it
need
not
produce
a
taxable
estate.
it's
the...
what...
because
as
administration
expenses
are
incurred,
they
may
be
deducted
on
the
estate.
the
administration
expenses
being
incurred
here
today
need
have
no
effect
whatever
on
the
taxable
estate
because
as
the
administration--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
because
what
the...
in
that
example,
the
problem
that
is
addressed
is
that
you
get
a
choice.
you
can
take
the
deduction
either
on
the
estate
tax
or
on
the
income
tax.
we
don't
think
that
you're
allowed
to
take
both.
642(g)
says
you're
not
allowed
to
take
both.
the
point
is
their
contention
gives
them
a
tax
benefit
both
on
the
income
tax
return
by
claiming
the
deduction
there
and
on
the
estate
tax
return
by,
as
the
case
is
described,
purchasing
the
encumbrance
and
obtaining
additional
value
through
the
bequest
by
purchase
rather
than
inheritance.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
recall
frankly
whether
to
say
yes
or
no,
but
what
i
recall
is
that
your
hypothetical
was
where
an
asset
of
the
value
of
$11
million
is
left
to
the
spouse
and
it
takes
$10
million
thereafter
to,
shall
we
say,
perfect
title
to
the
asset.
this
is
a
classic
example
that
the
court
dealt
with
in
the
stapf
case
where
the
net
value
of
the
marital
bequest
is
the
$11
million
reduced
by
the
obligation
left
under
the
will
to
pay
the
administration
expenses,
which
turned
out
to
be
$10
million.
the
net
value
of
the
bequest
was
$1
million.
that's
the
marital
deduction.
the
spouse
is
entitled
also
to
take
an
administration
expense
deduction
on
the
estate
tax
return,
so
there
is
no
taxable
estate.
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that,
in
your
hypothetical,
let's
say
$10
million
in
income
was
earned
by
this
asset
after
death.
in
that
case,
the
executor
could
elect
to
take
the
administration
costs
against
the
estate
tax
return
and
have
zero
income
tax
liability
on
the
$10
million
of
income.
and
our
point
is
that
that
doesn't
affect
the
calculation
of
the
marital
deduction.
the
marital
deduction
on
the
estate
tax
return
is
still
$1
million.
they
have
elected
not
to
take
the
administration
expense
deduction
on
the
estate
tax
return.
so,
the
taxable
estate
in
that
situation
is
$10
million,
but
there's
no
income
tax.
so,
under
642(g)
you
get
to
choose.
you
can
take
your
administration
expenses
against
the
estate
tax
or
you
can
take
them
against
the
income
tax.
you
can't
get
a
credit
for
both,
which
is
what
they're
asking
for
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
because
the...
in
your
hypothetical,
because
the
obligation
to
pay
these
expenses
is
on
the
marital
gift,
you
have
to
value
that
obligation
in
valuing
the
gift.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
in
your
hypothetical,
the
income
would
accrue
to
the
marital
gift.
it
was
income
that
would
either
go
to
the
spouse
or
would
be
used
to
pay
administration
expenses.
it's
like
the
$100,000,
$200,000
accounts
that
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning.
if
one
of
those
$100,000
accounts
requires
that
administration
expenses
be
paid
out
of
it,
that
reduces
the
value
of
that
account
on
the
date
of
the
gift.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
doesn't
matter
in
valuing
the
gift,
but
what
matters
in
valuing
the
gift
is
knowing
that
this
obligation
is
in
fact
imposed
on
the
marital
interest,
the
marital...
the
property
transferred,
whether
it
is
imposed
out
of
corpus
or
out
of
income.
let
me
go
back
just
one
step
because
some
of
these
questions
are
more
conceptually
difficult
as
we're
discussing
them
than
they
need
to
be
because
in
united
states
v.
stapf,
the
court
authoritatively
explained
the
language
of
the
statute
that
you're
referring
to
and
explained
in
stapf
that
the
focus
of
the
marital
deduction
is
on
the
value
of
the
property
that
passes
to
the
spouse.
and
the
court
said...
and
i'm
quoting...
the
appropriate
reference,
therefore,
is
not
to
the
value
of
the
property
moving
from
the
decedent.
it
is,
as
the
court
said,
to
the
net
value
of
the
property
passing
to
the
spouse.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
commissioner
has
cited
stapf
in
prior
cases,
and
i
think
that
you--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--when
the
case
came
up
to
this
court,
it
had
already
been
cited
in
the
commissioner's
favor
by
three
or
four
other
circuits,
and
i
think
that
the
other
circuit
decisions
were
directly
on
the
point
of
administration
expenses.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
stapf
was
not
directly
on
that
point,
although
stapf
answers
that
question
by
the
court's
discussion
at
the
end
which
says
that
administration
expenses
are
like
other
claims
against
the
estate,
and
when...
in
that
when
the
marital
bequest
is
burdened
by
the
obligation
of
paying
those
expenses,
that
in
effect
leaves
that
portion
of
the
estate
to
someone
else
rather
than
to
the
spouse.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
it
was
only--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--having
taken
that
option,
the
question
then
was
how
to
calculate
the
deduction.
the
logical
principle
of
stapf
and
that
applies
in
this
area
is
what
was
the
net
value...
what
was
the
gross
value
of
the
bequest,
reduced
by
the
cost
of
the
obligation
imposed
on
it.
all
of
the
applicable
statutes
and
regulations
embody
that
principle.
section
2055(c)
and
2056(b)(4)(a)
specify
that
when
the
obligation
of
paying
estate
taxes
is
placed
on
the
marital
or
charitable
bequest,
that
that
reduces
the
value
of
those
bequests
and
therefore
the
amount
of
those
deductions,
without
regard
to
whether
that
tax
is
later
paid
with
income
or
with
corpus.
in
section
2056(b)(4)(b),
congress
specified
the
same
result
when
any
encumbrance
or
obligation
is
placed
on
the
marital
bequest.
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
states
crystal
clearly
that
this
reduction
in
the
value
of
the
marital
bequest
and
in
the
amount
of
marital
deduction
must
be
made
without
regard
to
whether
that
payment
is
ultimately
made
out
of
corpus
or
out
of
income
attributable
to
the
corpus
of
the
bequest.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
estate
of
street.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
excuse
me.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
when
you
take
an...
when
you
incur
an
administration
expense,
and
you
claim
it
on
the
estate
tax
return,
you
don't
take
it
in
the
year
that
you
expended
it.
my
point
was
that
you
get
a
dollar...
if
i
have
an
estate
that
occurred
in
1982...
a
death
occurred
in
'82...
and
i
have
an
administration
expense
in
1990,
if
i
take
that
administration
expense
on
my
estate
tax
return,
i
take
a
dollar-for-dollar
amount.
i
don't
reduce
the
1990
administration
expense
back
to
present
value
in
determining
the
administration
expense
deduction
on
the
estate
tax
return.
and
since
we
don't
take
it
back
to
present
value
in
determining
the
administrative
expense
deduction
on
the
estate
tax
return,
we
also
don't
take
it
back
to
present
value
in
determining
the
reduction
in
the
marital
deduction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
congress
has
not
directed
us
to
make
that
kind
of
calculation.
what
congress
directed...
and
the
best
example
is
2055(c).
congress
specifies
that
when
the
amount
of
estate
taxes
are
paid
and
those
burden
the
marital
or
charitable
deduction,
you
get
a
dollar-for-dollar
reduction
in
the
marital
deduction
as
a
result.
so,
i
mean,
in
some
other
world,
you
might
have
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
was
for
the
charity.
that
was
2055(c).
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--2056(b)(4)(a)
and
2055(c)
are
respectively
the
marital
and
charitable
provisions
that
deal
with
the
reduction
in
those
deductions
when
the
estate
taxes
are
ultimately
paid
when
those
liabilities...
when
that
obligation
burdens
those
interests.
justice
ginsburg,
it
might
be
possible...
i
mean,
it
would...
frankly,
it
would
be
possible
to
have
all
of
this
done
on
a
present
value
basis.
that's...
and
if
we
started
from
scratch,
that
system
might
well
make
a
lot
of
good
sense,
but
you
can't
fit
part
of
that
present
value
approach
into
a
system
that
is
a
dollar-for-dollar
approach
on
all
other
items.
congress
by...
when
they
enacted
2056(b)(4)(b),
they
did
so
as
part
of
an
effort
to
enlarge
the
system
to
clarify
the
system
of
valuation
that
had
derived
from
2055(c),
that
had
derived
from
this
estate
tax
deduction
valuation
approach.
so--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
again,
this
is
real...
this
is
critical,
justice
scalia.
the
court
in
stapf
authoritatively
explained
what
that
language
meant
and
said
that
you
don't
look,
as
you
might,
to
what
the
value
of
the
gift
from
the
husband
was
in
this
case.
you
look
to
the
net
value
of
what
passes
to
the
spouse
because
the
focus
of
this
is
on
a
deduction.
it's
on
the
marital
deduction,
what
passes
to
the
spouse.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
really--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
really
doesn't
matter
how
the
administrative
expense
obligation
is
paid.
the
spouse
could
simply
write
a
check
for
all
the
administration
expenses,
or
she
could
use
post-death
income,
or
she
could
use
corpus.
those
obligations
have
to
be
paid.
it
doesn't
matter
how
they're
paid.
what
matters
is
how
much
are
they,
and
under
stapf
and
under
the
statute,
how
much
they
are
is
a
reduction
in
the
value
of
what
passes
to
her
under
the
bequest.
if
she
pays
off
those
obligations
with
any
other
source
of
income,
that's
what
the
courts
describe
as
purchasing
the
encumbrance
rather
than
inheriting
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
it
is
encumbered.
i
mean,
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
marital
interest
isn't
necessarily
subject
to
administration
expenses.
in
these
residuary
bequests--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it...
that
obligation
is
what
the
statute
refers
to
as
an
obligation
in
connection
with
the
passing
of
the
interest.
any
obligation
in
connection
with
the
passing
of
the
interest
has
to
be
reduced
from
the
face
value
of
the
bequest
to
determine
what
stapf
calls
the
net
value.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
they
said
both,
justice
souter.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
the
second
phrase
says
any
obligation
imposed
in
connection
with
the
passing
of
the
interest.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
under...
there
is
a
regulation
that
applies
here,
and
it
applies
squarely
and
specifically.
and
this
regulation
was
adopted
in
1949,
the
year
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
it
has
been
consistently
applied.
it
is
a
longstanding,
contemporaneous
regulation.
it
is
entitled
to
substantial
deference.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
same
principles
apply
because
in
all
of
these
situations--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--only
if
they
avoid
taxes
on
the
income
side.
there's
no
need
for
there
to
be
a
taxable
estate.
they
can
take
the
administration...
administrative
expense
deduction
with
the
estate
taxes.
it's
only
when
they
try
to
shelter
the
income
that
this
gap
appears
on
the
estate
tax
side,
as
our
brief
explains
in
some
detail.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
it's
incurred
for...
solely
for
the
production
of
income,
then
we
have
a
question
about
whether
it's
truly
an
administration
expense.
in
this
case,
we
haven't
gotten
into
that.
we
have
accepted
all
of
the
claimed
expenses
as
administration
expenses.
it's
the
service's
view
that
expenses
incurred
in
the
operation
of
a
business
are
not
administration
expenses.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
would
not
be
a
solution
because
in
this
case
it's
our
understanding
that
substantial
amounts
were
expended
in
a
will
contest
and
in
litigation
concerning
the
estate.
that's
a
normal
kind
of
administration
expense.
this
issue
comes
up
frequently.
it
isn't...
the
problem
isn't
limited
to
the
question
where
administrative
expenses
are
bloated
by
improper
charges.
we
accept
these
as
proper
charges,
and
this
is
the
problem
that
comes
up
all
the
time
under
these
cases
that
have
addressed
this
now
five
times.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
have
two
points
i
will
try
to
make
very
briefly.
the
first
is
that
stapf
by
its
terms
applies
its
net
value
logic
to
administration
expenses
as
well
as
to
other
claims
against
the
estate.
at
page
134,
the
court
said
in
both
instances,
referring
to
both
administration
expenses
and
claims,
by
directing
that
payment
be
made
of
debts
chargeable
to
another
or
to
non-estate
property
reduces
his
net
estate
and
in
effect
confers
a
gift
or
bequest
upon
another,
which
is
exactly
why
we
have
to
reduce
the
marital
deduction
because
the
net
value
of
the
bequest
has
been
burdened
by
this
encumbrance.
i
need
to
say
very
briefly
that
the
regulations
and
rulings
that
the
tax
court
and
that
the
taxpayer
rely
on
are
a
classic
example
of
apples
and
oranges.
the
regulations
and
rulings
that
the
tax
court
relied
on
were
under
2056(b)(5)
which
relates
to
a
marital
deduction
when
a
gift
is
left
in
trust,
where
the
spouse
gets--
