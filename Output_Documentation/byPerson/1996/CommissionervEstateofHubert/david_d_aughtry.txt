mr.
david
d.
aughtry
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
difference
between
the
course
taken
by
15
out
of
17
of
the
united
states
tax
court
judges
and
the
majority
opinion
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
course
urged
by
the
commissioner
in
this
litigation
is
that
the
tax
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
followed
the
actual
flow
of
the
property.
it
followed
the
actual
flow
of
the
corpus
as
determined
under
controlling
state
law
and
as
determined
under
the
testamentary
document
which
the
commissioner
properly
stipulated
controlled
the
actual
flow
of
the
property.
the
commissioner
in
this
case
urges
a
federal
fiction
that
overrides
the
controlling
testamentary
documents,
that
overrides
the
state
property
and
probate
law,
that
overrides
frankly
her
own
estate
tax
regulations
and
rulings--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--there
comes
a
point
in
time
when
it
must
go
on
the
fiduciary
return,
but
in
our
view
if
it
goes...
if
a
dollar
of
corpus
goes
to
administrative
expenses,
it
cannot
go
to
the
wife
and
it
cannot
go
to
charity.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
you
can
take
the
deduction,
but
if
you
use
corpus
there,
it
does
reduce
the
available
corpus
to
go--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes,
sir.
and
in
fact
there
comes
a
point
in
time
where
you
must.
once
the
statute
of
limitation
goes
on
the
final
state
tax
return,
the
income
tax
return
is
the
only
place
you
can
take--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
in
speaking
of
corpus,
we
have
to
speak
in
terms
of
the
corpus
as
it
existed
as
of
the
date
of
death.
to
the
extent
that
that
corpus
is
used
to
pay
expenses
and
claimed
as
an
expense
as
it
may
be
on
the
income
tax
return,
that
corpus
is
not
available
to
pay
the
marital
or
the
charitable
estate
tax.
the
marital
and
the
charitable
estate
tax
is
by
statute
restricted
to
the
date-of-death
corpus.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
in
our
view,
yes,
and
that
i
believe
was
the
effect
of--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--no,
your
honor.
we
measure...
and
as
this
court
held
in
maass
v.
higgins
and
bull
v.
united...
you
take...
the
state
tax
regime
takes
a
snapshot
of
what
comes
into
the
estate
at
the
date
of
death,
and
then
you
trace
that
corpus.
now,
you
may
take
that
corpus
and
pay
it
to
the
wife,
if
you're
permitted
to
do
so
by
the
testamentary
documents,
or
you
may
take
and
pay
it
against
corpus,
if
permitted
to
do
so
by
the
testamentary
documents
and
state
law,
but
if
you
do
that,
it
can't
go
in
both
places.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
if
those
expenses
are
paid
out
of
income,
the
marital
deduction
is
the
full
amount
of
the
corpus.
if
they're
paid
out
of
corpus,
then
the
marital
deduction
is--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--the
marital
deduction
is
reduced
in
that
instance.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
if...
the
hypothetical
was
there
were
$2
million
in
date-of-death
corpus
that
comes
in,
and
we
know
for
distribution
purposes
we
use
the
exact
same
date
for
valuing.
if
$1.8
million
goes
to
the
wife
and
two
of
it
goes
to
administration
expenses,
the
wife
has
a
$1.8
million
deduction.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
no,
but--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--but
you
have
to
trace
it
under...
as
i
read
ballantine,
roney,
and
that
line
of
cases,
you
have
to
trace
it.
you
have
to
trace
the
actual
flow
of
the
corpus,
the
date-of-death
corpus.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
you
absolutely
trace
it
wherever
it
goes.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
the
value
of...
and
if
we
assume
it's
all
going
to
wife.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
then--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--then
you
would
do
it
precisely
as
we
did
in
this
estate.
you
would
set
aside--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--no.
the
estate...
the
date-of-death
value
of
the
property
is
the
$10
million.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
you
just
trace
the
corpus.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
there
are
three
points,
time
permitting,
that
we'd
like
to
focus
on
is,
one,
the
single
most
important
point
in
reaching
the
right
decision
in
this
case
may
be
the
most
basic.
the
difference
between
those
courts
that
got
the
answer
right
and
those
that
didn't,
those
that
got
it
right
took
the
time
to
carefully
define
their
terms,
as
the
tax
court
did
in
its
first
footnote,
before
rushing
to
analysis.
and
as
a
consequence,
they
avoided
the
false
equation
that's
been
so
sharply
criticized
by
the
commentators,
the
false
equation
that
equates
marital
share
with
marital
deduction.
marital
deduction
consists
solely
of
date-of-death
corpus.
marital
share
consists
of
both
the
corpus
and
income.
two,
the
statutory
structure
of
the
federal
estate
tax
regime
is
built
upon
the
sound,
sensible
foundation
of
symmetry,
and
that
symmetry
is
achieved
by
taking
the
same
statutory
term
for
measuring
property
coming
in
and
leaving
the
estate,
value,
and
applying
it
at
the
same
precise
point
in
time.
indeed,
we
feel
like
we
believe
that
that's
a
constitutionally
driven
proposition.
this
is
a
transfer
tax
that
we're
working
with,
and
we
take
a
picture
at
the
effective
transfer
date
by
operation
of
law
which
is
the
date
of
death,
unless
of
course
the
decedent...
excuse
me...
the
executor
elects
an
alternate
valuation
date.
to
show
you
how
closely
tied
this
inclusion
and
distribution
concept
is,
there's
a
specific
statute
that
says
if
my
fiduciary,
when
i
die,
elects
the
alternate
valuation
date,
that
alternate
valuation
date
must
be
used
not
only
for
inclusion
purposes,
it
must
also
be
used
for
charitable
contribution
and
for
marital
deduction
purposes.
we,
time
permitting,
hope
to
demonstrate
the
practical
application
of
these
principles
to
reality
and
how
it
renders
the
result
of
order
and
symmetry.
indeed,
time
permitting,
we
will
demonstrate
to
you
how
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
designed.
the
object
of
that
position
is
to
create
what
we
call
a
disappearing
residuary.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
actually,
your
honor,
we
applied
stapf
in
this
case
in
the
distribution
of
the
property
here.
it
just
doesn't
apply
to
the
impact
of
administration
expenses
on
the
burden
borne
by
corpus
or
the
income
beneficiary.
what
stapf...
as
we
read
stapf...
and
indeed
the
government
has
in
effect
deemed
by
way
of
a
revenue
ruling...
is
that
you
look
at
the
value.
you
look
if
there's
a
mortgage
or
something
of
that
sort,
and
we
had
substantial
mortgages
in
this
case.
and
then
you
look
at
the
equity
received
by
either
the
wife
or
the
charity.
stapf,
however,
as
pointed
out
by
several
of
the
questions
raised
during
my
colleague's
presentation,
focused
upon
the
situation
where
the
obligation
existed
at
the
date
of
death.
as
a
matter
of
certainty
as
to
existence,
it
was
in
existence
in
the
will,
and
it
was
an
obligation
imposed
upon
corpus
not
upon
income.
and
so,
in--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--yes.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
corpus
has
to
go
there,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
two
reasons.
one,
the
statute,
and
it
takes
a
little
bit
of
effort
to
work
through
this.
2056(b)(4)(b)
speaks
only
to
obligations
on
corpus.
we
know
that
because
2056(b)(4)
only
speaks
to
that
marital
share
for
which
a
deduction
is
allowable.
what
does
that
mean?
well,
let
me
take
a
step
back.
2056(b)(4)(b)
says
any
obligation
or
encumbrance
on,
quote,
such
property
or
interest.
what
does
such
property
or
interest
mean?
we
take
a
step
upstream
to
2056(b)(4)
to
the
introductory
paragraph,
and
it
says
that
property
passing
to
the
spouse
for
which
a
deduction
is
allowable.
and
what
does
that
mean?
you
go
to
the
introductory
paragraph
of
2056(a)
and
it
says
that
the
deduction
that
is
allowable
is
only
to
the
extent
that
it's
included
in
the
gross
estate.
these
two
statutory
provisions
are
the
statutory
genesis
for
the
undisputed
point
that
you
measure
the
distribution
by
the
exact
same
measure
that's
used
for
inclusion
in
the
gross
estate.
and
so,
we
say
to
you
that
2654(b)
itself
clearly
or
at
least
establishes
that
the
obligation
must
be
on
corpus.
the
regulation
which
the
commissioner
relies
upon
in
this
case--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--that
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
it's
an
absolute
commitment
at
the
time
of
the
date
of
death
that
all
must
go.
it...
what
we
look
to...
and
indeed
what
the
commissioner
has
acknowledged
by
revenue
rulings
appropriate...
you
look
to
state
law
to
see...
and
this
is
revenue
ruling
88-12.
you
look
to
state
law
to
see
who
bears
this
burden.
if
it
is
the
corpus
beneficiary,
then
the
corpus
beneficiary
must
bear
the
burden.
if
it
is
the
income
beneficiary,
then
it's
the
income
beneficiary,
and
it
does
not
impact
the
corpus.
indeed,
there
is
a
second
ruling
by
the
commissioner
that
is
at
odds
with
an
answer
that
we
received
earlier
that
says
when
you
have
that
situation,
the
granting...
as
we
do
here,
the
granting
of
a
power
to
allocate
expenses
between
the
corpus
beneficiary
and
the
income
beneficiary,
quote,
it
shall
result
in
no
disallowance
or
diminution
of
the
marital
deduction,
close
quote,
for
gift
tax
purposes...
the
gift
tax
rules
that
you
stressed
earlier
are
invoked
here
by
statute...
or
for
estate
taxes.
so,
we
know
under
these
rulings
that
it
makes
a
difference,
that
you
look
to
state
law,
and
then--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--actually,
no,
your
honor,
because
in
that
particular
circumstance,
it's
a
gift
tax
ruling.
the
grant
of
the
power
occurs
at
the
same
time
that
the
transferring
the
gift
tax
does.
for
example,
if
i'm
making
out
a
marital
deduction
trust
and
i'm
making
a
transfer,
a
gift
today,
to
my
wife
and
if
i
provide
this
provision,
the
value
is
measured
today.
the
value
is
measured
today.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
diminution
in
my
gift
tax
obligation,
it's
going
to
occur
today.
it's
not
going...
you
know,
what
happens
down
the
road
doesn't
alter
that.
and
we
know
that
that
particular
principle
is
incorporated
in
these
estate
tax
provisions
by
statute
to
provide
a
continuing
symmetry
between
the
estate
tax
provisions
and
the
gift
tax
provisions.
the
third
point
we
wish
to
note
is
that
the
government's
position
here
works
a
statutory
impossibility
in
most
cases,
works
a
factual
impossibility
in
this
case,
and
indeed
renders
bizarre
results
every
time
this
federal
fiction
is
pitched
in
conflict
with
the
majority
rule
embraced
by
at
least
42
of
the
50
states.
let
me
speak
for
a
moment,
if
i
could,
about
certain
of
the
other
points
that
were
raised
during
the
earlier
presentation.
i
want
to
stress
this.
the
government
in
this
ruling
i
alluded
to
i
think
has
essentially
conceded
the
spirit
of
this
case.
in
revenue
rule
69-56,
the
government
says
there
is
no
diminution
in
the
marital
deduction.
you
tie
that
into
revenue
ruling
88-12,
which
says
you
look...
in
determining
the
impact
of
debts
and
expenses
in
calculating
the
net
value...
in
calculating
the
net
value...
of
the
marital
deduction,
state
law
is
determinative.
the
other
aspect
that
arises
is
this
concept
that
we
are
somehow
equating
the
treatment
under
2053
with
the
treatment
under
2056(b)(4)(b).
they
are
different.
2053,
the
administrative
expense
that
the
commissioner
referred
to...
and
i
think
this
was
your
concern,
justice
ginsburg,
between
present
value
and
dollar-for-dollar
reduction...
is
where
the
corpus
goes.
it
is
a
dollar-for-dollar
concept.
this
is
not
our
situation
here.
here
the
commissioner
relies
upon
2056(b)(4)(b)
which
by
its
own
terms...
and
at
long
last
by
the
government's
contention...
is
a
valuation
concept.
you
should
know
that
the
government
denied
that
this
was
a
valuation
concept
in
the
tax
court
and
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
it
may
proceed
that
way.
it
need
not.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
well,
your
honor--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--first
of
all,
i
would
say--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--i
would
say
that...
i
would
say
this,
your
honor.
certainly
at
first
blush
you'd
say,
well,
you
know,
everything
sort
of
matches
up.
i
hope
that
i
can
demonstrate
to
your
satisfaction
that
that
analysis
involves
a
double
counting
where
the
controlling
testamentary
documents
and
the
state
law
permit
that
the
expenses
be
paid
out
of
income
as
do
42
of
the
50
states.
and
let
me
see
if
i
might
draw
some
distinctions
on
this
particular
hypothetical.
$2
million
estate.
if
under
the
controlling
testamentary
documents
and
state...
excuse
me...
and
state
law,
it
has
to
be
paid
out
of
corpus,
the
surviving
spouse
gets
$1.8
million.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
it
permits
a
balancing
in
the
allocation
of
expenses
between
the
income
beneficiary
and
the
corpus
beneficiary
and
if,
for
whatever
reason,
just
for
simplicity
purposes
let's
assume
that
the
whole
expenses
were
permitted
to
be
paid
out
of
income
and
were
properly
under
state
law
and
properly
under
controlling
testamentary
documents,
then
i
as
the
fiduciary
am
transferring
$2
million
of
property
to
the
spouse.
that's
got
to
be
recognized,
the
date-of-death
value
of
what's
being
included,
the
date-of-death
value
of
what's
being
distributed.
and
i've
got
a
check
to
various
vendors
that
total
$200,000,
and
so
there's
$2.2
million
of
reality
that
has
flowed
there.
under
the
government's
approach,
they
would
take
that
amount
properly
paid
out
of
the
expenses...
excuse
me...
those
expenses
properly
paid
out
of
income
and
pretend
it
was
paid
out
of
capital
so
that
the
fiction
would
work
that
there's
only
$2
million
of
distributions
when
it's
properly
$2.2
million
of
distributions.
your
example
with
respect
to
the
martian
is
very
much
like
the
situation
in
ballantine
and
roney
where
there
was
an
obligation
on
corpus
and
it's
viewed...
and
i
agree
with
this
completely.
it's
viewed
that
whereas
the
obligation
on
corpus
if
somebody
else
comes
in
and
helps
them
out,
it
doesn't
change
the...
you
cannot
violate
state
law
and
the
controlling
testamentary
documents
and
circumvent
and
alter
the
result.
you
got
to
follow
what
the
commitments
are
on
corpus,
as
the
commissioner
said
in
revenue
ruling
88-12.
and
so,
at
first
blush
everything
seems
to
stack
up
nicely,
but
what
happens
is
you
only
get
to
that
result
and
ignore
the
$2
million...
excuse
me...
$200,000
properly
paid
out
of
income
under
state
law
and
controlling
testamentary
documents
if
you
double
count,
if
you
use
$2
to
create
every
$1
of
deduction,
and
you
ignore
the
payments.
see,
the
problem...
the
additional
problem
with
that
is
let's
assume
that
in
a
situation
there
where
the
expenses
are
paid
out
of
income,
that
we're
going
to
pretend
it
reduces
the
marital
corpus
anyway,
what
that
does
is
that
creates
this
gap,
this
disappearing
residuary.
and
then
that
creates
a
tax
which
is...
you
say,
well,
now
where
are
we
going
to
pay
that
tax
from?
well,
you
already
spent
all
your
income
on
the
expenses.
you
can't
pay
it
out
of
there.
the
government
would
presume
it's
paid
out
of
corpus
anyway.
so,
the
tax
on
that
$200,000
is
taken
back
in
to
reduce
the
amount
of
corpus
flowing
to
the
wife
which
creates
another
tax
which
is
taken
back
in
to
further
reduce
the
marital
deduction
of
the
wife
which
creates
another
tax,
spiraling
downward,
ever
downward.
this
is
the
multiplier
effect
addressed
by
the
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
american
council
on
education
and
united
way.
and
for
that
reason,
it
creates
sort
of
a
chaotic
result
which...
because
you
don't
have
any
income
left.
what's
worse...
and
this
is
sort
of
the
point
of
the
government's
position
with
respect
to,
well,
you
can
always
just
sort
of
waive
your
election
under
642(g)
and
leave
it
on
the
gift
tax
return,
leave
the
expenses
on
the
gift
tax
return.
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that,
as
the
commentators
have
recognized,
that
operates
to
repeal
642(g).
one
of
the
articles
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
says,
does
a
642
election
still
make
sense?
what
that
does
is,
sure,
you
can
take
the
expenses
that
you
paid
out
of
income
in
your
hypothetical,
sir,
the
$200,000
expenses
that
were
actually
paid
out
of
income
and
move
them
back
over
to
the
estate
tax
return.
what
happens
if
you
do
that?
and
that's
i
think
the
government's
ultimate
object.
you
end
up
with
an
income
tax
on
gross
income,
on
the
full
$200,000.
by
depriving
the
income
beneficiary
the
benefit
of
those
deductions,
you
create
a
tax
on
gross
income,
and
that
income
beneficiary
doesn't
have
any
net
income
to
pay
those
taxes
with.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
no.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
well,
i
mean,
it's
true
that
there
are
circumstances
where
there
is
no
meaningful
election,
but
you
cannot--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--right.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
well,
to
be
sure,
the
estate
taxing
is
imposed
on
a
very
small
sliver
of
the
american
population,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
don't
think
it's
an
answer
to
say
we
have
a
meaningful
election
available
to
all
citizens,
to
say
yes,
there
are
some
circumstances
where
it
doesn't
do
you
any
good
to
exercise
the
election.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
not
that
it
will
be
of
benefit
to
everybody,
but
i
would
say
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
those
who
don't
have
a
meaningful
election
because
they
don't
have
an
estate
tax
return
that's
due
does
not
address
the
problem
that
those
who
need
the
meaningful
election
ought
to
garner
some
benefit
from
the
election.
the
circumstances
that
we
think
we
face
here
are
largely
cured
in
our
minds
by
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
in
estate
of
warren.
in
estate
of
warren,
you'll
recall
the
court
noted
that
there
is
no
preference
in
federal
tax
law
as
to
whether
or
not
these
expenses
are
borne
by
the
income
beneficiary
or
the
corpus
beneficiary.
and
you
should
know
in
this
case
the
income
beneficiary
and
the
corpus
beneficiary
in
the
marital
deduction
qtip
trust,
qualified
terminable
interest
trust,
are
two
different
people.
it's
two
completely
different
people.
what
warren
says,
that
there
is
no
preference,
it's
interesting
to
me
as
i
read
the
government's
distinction.
as
i
understood
the
government's
distinction,
the
government
said
there
in
1993,
as
they
said
in
revenue
ruling
88-12,
well,
we
relied
upon
exclusively
the
controlling
testamentary
document.
well,
if
it
is
appropriate
to
rely
exclusively
upon
the
controlling
testamentary
document
in
1993
in
warren,
as
the
government
had
relied
exclusively
upon
state
law
and
the
controlling
testamentary
documents
before
or
relied
in
large
measure
before
in
ballantine,
alston,
and
roney,
why
is
it
not
appropriate
here?
why
isn't
it
appropriate
here?
isn't
what
the
effect
of
the
government's
position
saying
is
that
when
i
go
determine
who
bears
these
administrative
expenses
as
between
my
wife
and
my
children
on
a
different...
a
marital
bequest
and
a
non-marital
bequest,
state
law
governs.
but
when
i
go
to
allocate
expenses
as
between
my
wife
and
my
children
in
a
life
estate
in
a
remainder
context,
somehow
state
law
does
not
obtain.
and
so,
we
say
there's
no
basis,
no
material
difference
for
altering
the
control
of
state
law
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
to
the
extent
that
i'm
conforming
with
my
state
law
fiduciary
duties,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
i
don't
believe
that
it's
a
fluke
case.
i
think
it's
a
smaller
case
than
the
danger
that's
being
created
here.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
the
danger
is
that
this
concept
of
date-of-death
valuation
is
a
concept
that
is
being...
we
think
is
being
undermined
here
with
the
concept
of
opening
the
door
to
hindsight.
but
it...
and
it's
arisen
in
five
cases
by
our
count
in
50
years...
five
cases
in
50
years...
in
which
the
deductions
are
being
shaved.
but
that
concept,
that
date-of-death
valuation
concept,
impacts
the
inclusion
of
every
asset
on
every
estate
in
america.
and
so,
if
we
open
the
door,
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
ithaca
trust,
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
on
the
inclusion
side
in
maass
v.
higgins
and
bull
v.
united
states,
to
hindsight,
i
think
the
government's
going
to
lose
far
more
revenue
than
they
would
gain
by
shaving
these
deductions
in
these
five
cases.
and
so,
i
say
to
you
i
think
it
is
a
broad
concept.
i
think
we're
dealing
with
fundamental
principles
of
estate
taxation,
and
it's
a
dangerous
thing
for
a
very
small
benefit
here
to
open
a
door
to
a
large
loss
there.
i
don't
know
if
that's
at
all
responsive
to
your
question.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
your
honor,
we
subscribe
to
justice
holmes'
theory.
justice
holmes
advocated
in
his
lectures
before
harvard...
they
were
ultimately
embodied
in
the
common
law...
that
the
law
ought
to
be
more
concerned
with
the
practical
application
to
reality
based
upon
experience
than
with
detached
logic
or--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--i
know.
[laughter]
a
fortunate
soul,
indeed.
he
did,
however,
apply
that--
he
did,
however,
apply
that
wisdom
in
his
decision
in
ithaca
trust
which
is
i
think
squarely
on
point
in
principle
with
this
case.
in
ithaca
trust,
we
were
dealing
with
a
deduction,
a
circumstance
where
a
gentleman
died.
he
left
a
life
estate
to
his
wife
with
the
remainder
interest
to
the
charity.
and
the
question
was,
how
do
we
measure
the
value
of
that
charitable
deduction?
as
events
turned
out,
the
wife
regrettably
died
by
way
of
accident
1
year
later
and
the
state
wanted
to
come
in
and
said,
well,
you
know,
the
life
estate
is
much
smaller
and
therefore
the
remainder
interest
is
much
greater
and
therefore
the
charitable
contribution
deduction
is
much
greater.
and
justice
holmes,
on
behalf
of
this
court
in
ithaca
trust
said,
i
know
the
temptation
to
take
what
is
now
the
readily
known
fact,
the
matter
of
certainty,
to
resolve
the
past
event,
but
if
we're
to
be
true
to
this
principle
of
date-of-death
valuation
for
deduction
purposes,
distribution
purposes,
in
addition
to
being
true
to
this
principle
in
maass
v.
higgins
and
bull
v.
united
states
for
inclusion
purposes,
we
cannot
succumb
to
the
temptation
of
using
hindsight.
we
cannot
proceed
to
resolve
those
uncertainties
that
existed,
that
must
exist
in
every
valuation
at
the
date
of
valuation.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
you
trace
the
corpus.
you
take
the
date
of
death,
and
wherever
that
corpus
goes,
you
trace
it.
you
don't
use
hindsight
to
erode
the--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--no.
no,
your
honor.
you
look
to
who
gets
that
property.
2056
and
2055
both
speak
specifically
to
the
property
included
as
of
the
date
of
death
in
the
gross
estate,
and
they
can
only
get
a
deduction
equal
to
that
amount
of
corpus
that
they
ultimately
got.
and
we
measure
what
they
got.
it's
a
question
of
my
wife
got
precisely
what
i
gave
here.
what
i
gave
her
was--
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
symmetry.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
aughtry
symmetry,
i
submit
to
you,
is
far
preferable
to
the
sort
of
chaos
that
we've
tried
to
describe
as
best
we
could
in
our
brief
of
a
disappearing
residuary,
of
the
downward
spiral,
of
multiplier
effect,
and
of
the
unnecessary
conflict
created
between
the
commissioner's
recent
construction
of
this
regulation
adopted
40
years
after
the
fact,
the
conflict
between
that
construction,
the
commissioner's
own
estate
tax
regulations
and
rulings...
we've
cited
69-56.
the
ruling
specifically
says
there's
no
diminution...
and
indeed
in
conflict
with
the
gift
tax
regulations
and
rules
invoked
here
by
statute.
symmetry
and
order
we
urge
upon
you
is
preferable
to
that
form
of
chaos.
thanks
so
very
much.
