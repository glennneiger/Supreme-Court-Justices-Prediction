justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
that
case
it
was
the
decedent's
act
that
did
it,
as
i
recall.
wasn't
it
the
provision
of
the
will
that
required
it
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case
it
didn't
involve
a
charge
which
was
wholly
contingent
at
the
time
of
death
and
which
simply
arose
later
and
then,
under
the
statutory
option,
was
charged
against
the
marital
share.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't
know
what
the
expenses
are--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
we
don't
know
that
there's
going
to
be
a...
for
example,
a
will
contest
or
something
like
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
meaning
then
of
the
introductory
phrase
in
(b)(4)(b),
where
the
interest
in
property,
et
cetera,
is
encumbered,
i
guess
has
to
be
read
to
mean
it
will
always
be
encumbered
by
an
administrative
expense.
justice
david
h.
souter
unless
there's
a
contrary
direction.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
a...
certainly
in
a
residuary
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
there's
no
contrary
instruction,
it
always
will
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
will
always
fit
within
your
so-called
purchase
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
you
one
more
question?
why
didn't
they
say
just
what
you
said,
any
obligation,
as
opposed
to
any
encumbrance?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
initial
phrase
refers
to
encumbrance.
