mr.
jones,
if
we
value
the
estate
at
the
time
of
death,
why
don't
we
also
value
these
encumbrances
at
the
time
of
death?
that
is
one
part
of
your
argument
that
i
don't
follow.
if
you
say
it's
an
encumbrance
on
the
estate
at
the
time
of
death,
then
if
one
were
planning
to
pay
it,
one
would
have
an
amount
that
would
yield,
say,
4
years
later
what
these
expenses
are.
but
you
are
arguing
for
a
dollar-for-dollar
deduction
and
not
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--present
value
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
throughout
your
brief,
you
put
the
marital
deduction
and
the
charitable
deduction
together.
and
i
hope
you
can
explain
to
me
how
your
example
in
your
reply
brief
would
work
out
if
you
had
chosen
to
use
as
your
illustration
a
charitable
deduction
instead
of
a
marital
deduction,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
lead
to
a
rather
bizarre
result
of
a
taxable
estate
of
$50,000.
if
the
only
beneficiary
is
a
charity,
that
it
gets...
all
of
the
income
would
be
exempt--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
i
just
asked
a
question.
would
the
bottom
line
on
page
3
be
different
if
the
example
that
you
had
given
us
was
a
charitable
deduction
rather
than
a
marital
deduction?
you
say
that
the
result
is...
a
taxable
estate
of
$500,000
results
in
this
example.
would
the
same
follow
if
your
example
had
used,
instead
of
the
marital
deduction,
the
charitable
deduction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
may
i
go
back
to
a
point
i
raised
this
morning
and
perhaps
you
can
straighten
me
out
on
it.
i'm
referring
to
page
28
of
your
brief
where
you
give
us
the
example.
you
say
that
these
expenses
are
a
burden
on
the
estate
at
the
time
of
the
death,
and
you
give
us
an
analogy
to
the
executor
setting
aside
a
portion
of
the
residuary
estate
to
pay
those
future
expenses.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
tax
court
judges
too,
judge
dubina,
said
that
administrative
expenses
are
deemed
to
accrue
on
the
date
of
death.
in
both
your
set-aside
example
and
the
dissenting...
or
was
it...
it
was
the
sixth
circuit
judge
dubina,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
said
they're
deemed
to
accrue
at
the
date
of
death.
well,
if
that
is
so,
will
you
explain
to
me
again
why
you
are
not
using
a
present
value,
a
discounted
value
notion,
and
why
you
are
using
the
dollar-for-dollar
in
this
context
as
opposed
to
what
you
explained
before
when
you
actually
incur
the
expense
and
you
take
it
as
a
deduction?
you
take
it
in
the
year
that
you
incur
it.
but
why
on
this
set-aside--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--analogy
don't
you
use
discounted
value?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
shouldn't
the
match
be
between
the
value
of
the
estate
at
the
date
of
the
death?
why
isn't
that
the
proper
match
to
look
at?
if
you're
evaluating
the
assets
at
the
date
of
death,
why
don't
you
evaluate
the
encumbrances
at
the
date
of
death?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
has
congress
specified
for
the
charity?
i
asked
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
you
said
something...
didn't
you
just
say
something
about
marital
deduction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
the
regulation
that
deals
with
marital
deduction?
it
doesn't
deal
with
charitable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
the
two
are
to
be
treated
alike.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
you
could
have
a
case
where
the
entire...
everything
is
left
to
a
charity
and
you
could
end
up
on
the
example
that
you
gave
with
a
taxable
estate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
the
expense
is
incurred
for
the
production
of
that
income.
you
don't
match
the
expense
against
the
income.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
aughtry,
justice
breyer
raised
a
question
of
really
does
this
matter
much.
is
this
a
fluke
case?
and,
after
all,
even
you
should
take
the...
from
now
on
you
can
take
the
expenses
against
the
corpus.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
is
this
just
a
fluke
case?
what...
does
it
matter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
that
danger?
