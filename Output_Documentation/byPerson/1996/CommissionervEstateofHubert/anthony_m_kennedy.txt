justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
the
executor
has
the
election,
does
he
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
the
executor
elects
to
pay
the
deduction
out
of
the
estate,
i
can
see
why
that
should
reduce
the
estate.
but
you're
telling
us
that
if
there's
a
$50,000
administrative
expense
that
we
can
anticipate
down
the
line,
that
it's
the
same
thing,
cases
a,
if
$50,000
is
deducted
from
the
corpus
that
ever
goes
to
the
beneficiary,
so
he
gets
a
corpus
less
$50,000;
and
case
b,
he
gets
the
full
corpus
and
the
income
is
fully
sufficient
to
pay
the
$50,000.
i'd
much
rather
be
the
beneficiary
in
case
2
than
case
1.
i
just
don't
see...
they
are
just
not
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
dollar-for-dollar
theory
doesn't
recognize
discounted
value...
time
value
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
completely
arbitrary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
language
in
stapf
dependent
upon
the
widow's
option
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
simply
the
fact
that
the
administrative
expenses
were
paid
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
your
view
that
was
not
predicated
at
all
upon
the
special
election
that
the
wife
had
to
make
in
that
case
because
it
seemed
to
me
at
first
reading
that
you
were
turning
the
present
election
that
the
executor
has
into
a
purchase
case.
you'd
make
every
election
a
purchase.
the
stapf
case
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
wife,
by
making
her
election,
was
in
effect
purchasing
her
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
just
extrapolating
that
and
saying
every
election
is
a
purchase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
expenses
are
payable...
administrative
expenses
are
payable
from
the
corpus,
i
take
it
there's
still
a
deduction
on
the
fiduciary
return?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i
was
just
talking
about
the
fiduciary
return.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
say
that
you
elect
not
to
take
the
expenses,
the
administrative
expenses,
from
the
estate.
you
elect
to
deduct
them
from
the
income--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
attributable
to
the
corpus.
under
state
law,
the
expenses
are
paid
from
the
corpus.
can
you
still
take
the
deduction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i'm
just...
all
i'm
talking
about
is
the
federal
fiduciary
income
tax
return.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
still
take
the
deduction
from
the
income
tax?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
one
more
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
state
law
provides
that
the
expense
of
administration
is
to
be
paid
from
corpus,
and
it's
a
$50,000
expense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
income
is
so
great
that
it
greatly
exceeds
$50,000
and
they
credit
all
of
the
income
at
the
end
of
the
year
to
corpus.
so
in
event...
in
any
event,
the
wife
gets
the
same.
what
results
under
your
view
of
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
that
even
though
the
wife
ends
up
in
both
cases
with
the
same,
in
the
example
where
the
administrative
expenses
must
be
paid
from
corpus,
that
does
reduce
the
marital
deduction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
some
point
in
your
discussion,
would
you
explain
to
me
why
the
government
is
wrong
in
deciding
stapf
as
controlling
in
this
case,
or
do
you
think
we
have
to
modify
stapf
in
order
to
reach
the
result
you
propose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
versus
the
estate
of
hubert
i
have
written
an
opinion
which
announces
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
a
case
involving
the
federal
estate
tax.
the
issue
concerns
the
proper
computation
of
the
marital
deduction
and
the
charitable
deduction
and
both
of
these
are
deductions
to
operate,
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
taxable
estate
when
the
decedent
estate
is
required
to
pay
federal
estate
tax.
this
matter
was
complicated
by
will
contest
and
contested
probate
proceedings
but
the
problem
can
be
stated
this
way:
suppose
the
will
establishes
a
charitable
trust
and
a
marital
deduction
trust
and
also
provides
that
the
expenses
of
administering
the
estate
are
to
be
paid
from
the
assets
or
the
income
of
the
assets
which
will
be
allocated
to
those
trusts.
are
the
marital
and
charitable
gifts
reduced
by
the
amount
of
those
expenses?
that
is
the
problem.
everyone
agrees
that
the
deductions
must
be
reduced
to
the
extent
principal
of
the
trust
are
used
to
pay
estate
expenses
and
the
regulations
and
statute
are
clear
on
that
point.
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
or
not
the
gifts
must
also
be
reduced
if
the
income
is
used
for
this
purpose
but
the
principal
amount
of
the
gift
remains
intact.
the
tax
court
ruled
that
in
some
cases,
such
as
the
one
before
us,
where
the
income
is
substantial,
no
reduction
is
required
even
where
some
of
that
income
is
used
to
pay
the
estate
expenses.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
and
affirmed
the
tax
court.
we
also
agree
and
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
the
controlling
regulation
says
that
the
amount
of
the
deduction
must
be
reduced
if
the
requirement
to
pay
expenses
is
a
material
limitation
on
the
right
to
receive
income.
not
every
case
in
which
some
income
is
diverted
for
this
purpose
presents
a
material
limitation.
the
commissioner's
insistence
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
reduction
of
the
deduction
in
every
case
where
some
income
which
used
to
pay
expenses
is
inconsistent
with
the
controlling
regulation.
the
opinion
announcing
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stevens
and
ginsburg.
justice
oâ€™connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
joined
by
justices
souter
and
thomas;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
breyer.
and
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
