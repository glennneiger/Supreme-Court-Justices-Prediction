you
just
should
say
no.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
could
i
follow
up
your
discussion
of
how
although
the
marital
deduction
is
evaluated
as
of
the
time
of
death,
you
can
take
account
of
later
developments
and
make
them
retroactive
back
to
the
time
of
death,
such
as
the
administrative
expenses?
now,
that's
certainly
true
in
the
estate
tax
area,
but
what
(b)(4)(b)
requires
here
is
that...
shall
be
taken
into
account
in
the
same
manner
as
if
the
amount
of
a
gift
to
such
spouse
if
such
interests
were
being
determined.
now,
for
purposes
of
the
gift
tax,
let's
assume
that
there's
a
gift,
an
inter
vivos
gift.
a
trust
is
established
with
income
to
the
spouse
and
the
remainder
to
somebody
else.
now,
for
purpose
of
the...
and
the
trustee
has
the
option
of
either
charging
the
administrative
expenses
of
the
trust
to
income
or
against
the
corpus
of
the
trust.
he
has
that
option.
would
you,
for
purposes
of
the
gift
tax,
wait
and
see
what
he
did
whether
he
charged
it
against
the
income
or
not
and
then
retroactively
evaluate
the
value
of
the
gift
to
the
spouse
on
the
basis
of
whether
that
option
was
exercised
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
on
the
gift.
it's
up
to
the
trustee,
just
as
it's
up
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it
isn't
clear
at
the
date
of
the
gift
whether
the
trustee
will
charge
it
against
the
income
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
what
(b)
tells
you
to
look
at
again
is
not
to
the
treatment
of
the
charitable
deduction
under
55(c),
but
rather
to
the
treatment
of
the
gift.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
really
restricted
to
the
date-of-death
corpus.
i
mean,
it's
date-of-death
corpus
less
administration
expenses
deducted
from
the
corpus.
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
understand
now.
let's
assume
a
$2
million
estate.
it
all
goes
to
the
wife.
the
expenses
paid
by
the
administrator
in
the
course
of
administrating...
administering
the
estate
are
$200,000.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
marital
deduction?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
paid
out
of
corpus.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
is
not
the
corpus
as
of
the
date
of
death.
it's
the
corpus
as
it's
reduced
by
the
administration
expenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
that
$200,000
goes
to
administration
expenses
until
3
years
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
of
the
date
of
death,
it
says
all
$2
million
goes
to
the
wife.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying...
you're
oversimplifying
by
saying
everything
is
looked
at
from
the
date
of
death.
it
surely
isn't.
you
do
take
account
of
the
administration
expenses
and
then
go
back
and
reduce
the
date-of-death
corpus
by
those
expenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
difference
that
makes.
what
i
don't
understand
about
your
case
is
why
you
acknowledge
as...
i'm
correct
that
you
acknowledge
that
if
this
obligation
were
placed
upon
corpus--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
would
reduce
the
marital
deduction.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
different
if
it's
placed
upon
income?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
mean,
an
obligation...
it
is
certainly
an
encumbrance
upon
corpus
to
say
that
all
of
the
interest
from
this
corpus
must
be
used
for
a
certain
purpose.
certainly
that
renders
the
corpus
less
valuable
to
me.
you
say,
here,
this
whole
corpus
is
yours,
provided
however
that
the
interest
from
it
for
the
first
5
years
must
be
given
to
somebody
else.
is
that
not
an
encumbrance
upon
the
corpus?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
say
that
only
applies
to
the
existence
of
the
power
and
not
to
its
exercise.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
government
correct
in
its
reply
brief
in
simply
saying
that
election
is
always
of
value
to
the
estate
that
doesn't...
that
isn't
large
enough
to
quality
for
the
estate
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
alone
is
a
common
enough
situation
to
justify
the
existence
of
that
option
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
most
estates
aren't
big
enough
to
have
to
worry
about
the
estate
tax
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
every
election
in
the
law
has
to
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
of
benefit
to
everybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
the
charge
is
against
the
corpus,
then
we
do
use
hindsight.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
universal
principle,
if
you're
willing
to
ignore
it
with
respect
to
the
corpus.
