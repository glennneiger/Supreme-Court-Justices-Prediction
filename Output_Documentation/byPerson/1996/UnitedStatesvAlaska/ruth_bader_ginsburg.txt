if
you
would
just
comment
on
the
comparison
with
the
mississippi
mudlumps,
which
is
this
island
question.

mr.
minear,
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there,
because
in
the
special
master's
report
there
was
a
concern
about
whether
there
was
authority
to
do
this
set-aside,
and
i
think
the
special
master
indicated
that
there
was
no...
or
it
was
highly
questionable
whether
there
was
any
inherent
authority.
as
i
take
it
in
your
exception,
you
are
relying
on
the
authority
that
you
get
from
this
6(e)
from
congress,
is
that--
