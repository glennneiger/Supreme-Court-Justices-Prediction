chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
84
original,
united
states
v.
alaska.
mr.
koester.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
evidence
tending
to
support
that,
or
is
it
simply
a
result
of
there's
no
other
reason
for
it
so
it
must
have
been
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
reading
from
one
of
the
briefs,
mr.
koester?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
what
you're
about
to
read...
is
it
found
in
any
of
the
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
enclaves.
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00.
mr.
koester,
will
you
continue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
it
really
make
much
difference,
since
the
submerged
lands
act
says
expressly
retain?
that
isn't
really
much
different
from
the
pollard
doctrine,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
it
would
be
easier
as
a
matter
of
useful
law
if
both
meant
the
same.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
koester.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
it
doesn't
control
this
issue
for
what
reason,
mr.
minear?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
statement
was
not
at
all
of
any
relevance
to
the
court's
analysis
in
the
view
of
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
think
you're
right,
but
do
you
think
nonetheless
that
the
court
thought
that
was
a
factor,
albeit
a
minor
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
alabama
case
came
after
the
california
case,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
convention
was,
what,
in
1958?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
had
become
states
before
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
would
decide
that
for
the
united
states?
i
mean,
certainly
it
isn't
the
mapping
service.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
conclusion
is
that
nebulous,
or
perhaps
not...
but
just
indeterminate
that
there
never
was...
shouldn't
there
be
some
burden
required
to
overturn
the
court's
statement
in
the
louisiana-mississippi
case
that
this
was
the
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
came
before
the
louisiana-mississippi
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
minear,
mr.
koester
left
his
argument
largely
on
this
point
to
his
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
perhaps
you'd
like
to
do
the
same.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
that's
the
first
time
they
read
the
statute.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
minear,
i
made
the
point
earlier
to
mr.
koester
i
think
one
can
read
that
notwithstanding
language
to
talk
about
the
authority
to
govern,
not
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
was
pointed
out
by
your
opponent
that
in
the
district
of
columbia,
which
is
an
enclave,
there's
certainly
a
great
deal
of
private
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
united
states
doesn't
own
the
enclave
in
a
property
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
expressly
retained
language
of
the
submerged
lands
act
means
roughly
the
same
thing
as
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
then
would
it
be
necessary
to
separate
those
two
out
if
we
did
agree
that
the
master
had
not
adequately
applied
the
utah
land
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
then...
you
say
that
it
is
two
different
tests,
that
expressly
retained
is
not
the
same
as
the
pollard
test
as
amplified.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
could
you
tell
me
whether
you
think
the
expressly
retained
language
is
a
test
just
about
like
the
pollard
test,
or
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't...
in
other...
it's
neither
just
about
like
pollard
or
different.
it's
similar,
is
your
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can't
you
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
amount
to
actually
setting
them
apart,
i
don't
think,
under
the
statute.
the
secretary,
as
the
master
point...
could
ultimately
turn
the
thing
down.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
you
don't
rely
on
any
midwest
oil
theory
that
the
executive
by
itself--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
expressly
retained
language
in
the
submerged
lands
act?
does
that
have
no
application
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no.
alaska
can
always
convey
them
back
to
the
federal
government--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--just
like
congress
can
convey
them
to
alaska.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
koester,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
koester.
the
case
is
submitted.
