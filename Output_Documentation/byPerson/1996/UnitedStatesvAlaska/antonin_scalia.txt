but
an
irrelevant
fact.
a
fact,
but
an
irrelevant
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
historic
bay,
then
that
fact
didn't
make
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
have
a
foreign
policy
justification
in
order
not
to
have
the
justification
of
prejudicing
alaska.
i
mean,
they
could
have
just
concluded
that
this
is
the
better
way
to
do
it,
that
in
fact
10
miles
is
too
long,
unless
you're
dealing
with
a
bay,
an
entrance
to
a
bay
or
something,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
there
was
no
dispute
that
10
miles
was
used
for
another
purpose.
i'm
not
clear
on
what
that
other
purpose
is.
is
it
the
entrance
to
bays?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
you
just
one...
the
master
was
of
the
view
that
the
united
states
had
adopted
in
the
hague
conference
in
1930
a
method
that
was
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
10-mile
method.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
10-mile
method,
though.
it's
something
different
from
that,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
mean
the
assimilation
method
that
they
proposed
at
the
hague
conference
was
not
the
10-mile
method.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
argument
you're
now
making
would
perhaps
handle
your
case,
but
it
wouldn't
produce
in
all
instances
the
same
result
that
you
want
with
the
10-mile
rule.
that
is
to
say,
in
some
instances...
what
is
the
arc
of
the
circle?
justice
antonin
scalia
three
miles.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
some
instances
you
may
have
two
islands
that
are
10
miles
apart,
and
you
draw
the
arcs
of
circles
and
they
don't
intersect,
so
you
don't
have
a
pocket
inside,
and
you
would
have
open
sea
between
the
land
and
past
the
islands,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
argument
you're
now
making
only
handles
those
situations
where
the
arcs
do
intersect
and
you
have
a
little
triangle
within
the
intersection,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
triangles...
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
section
11(b)?
where
does
that
appear
in
the
materials
we
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
it
was
wrong
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
presume
the
united
states
could
change
its
mind
as
to
whether
it
wants
to
use
that
discretionary
option
or
not,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
happens?
does
the
territory
of
alaska
contract
and
expand
as
the
government
changes
its
mind
regarding
the
interpretation
of
the
convention?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
understand
this.
i--
--it's
like
an
estoppel?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought...
i'm
sorry.
no,
excuse
me.
what
if
the
united
states
goes
and
adopts
the
10-mile
rule
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
the
convention
didn't
even
exist
then,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
too
late
now
for
this
case.
i
mean,
you're
not
contending
that
if
the
united
states
changes
its
mind
and
says
yes,
we're
going
to
go
with
the
option
under
the
convention,
that
you
would
then
concede
that
the
territorial
waters
of
alaska
expand?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
and
there
had
not
been
an
intervening
statehood,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
position
is
that
if
the
application
had
been
filed,
statehood
occurs,
and
then
the
application
is
denied
and
it
said
we're
not
going
to
set
this
aside
for
a
wildlife
refuge,
it's
still
withdrawn
from
the
state,
that
the
state
does
not
own
that
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
a
wildlife--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
only
for
a
wildlife
refuge.
what
about
another
application
to
close
this
certain
tract
to
mineral
leasing
and
other
uses,
but
because
we're
going
to
reserve
it
not
for
a
wildlife
refuge
but
for...
i
don't
know,
whatever,
a
national
park.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
purpose
of
the
application
is
what
governs?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
there
were
a
lot
of
states
who
had
interests
at
stake,
and
hence
a
critical
mass
to
get
something
done.
but
to...
you
know,
to
say,
don't
worry,
if
you
make
a
mistake
congress
will
give
it
to
alaska,
i'm
not
sure
that's
any
more
likely
than
that
alaska
would
give
it
to
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
was
it
at
the
time
of
statehood?
i
mean...
i
don't
understand
that.
isn't
that
the
crucial
time?
why
isn't--
