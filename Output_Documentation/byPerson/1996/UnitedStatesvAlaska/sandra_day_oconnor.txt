now,
the
10-mile
rule,
you're
referring
to
the
horizontal
sort
of
connections
between
islands,
and
the
10
miles
in
between
the
ends
of
the
two
islands
that
are
off-shore?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
not
talking
about
some
vertical
rule.
you're
talking
about
the
horizontal
connecting
line.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
court
dealt
with
that
in
one
sense
at
least
in
that
mississippi
sound
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
that
case
one
that
was
based
on
historic
treatment,
kind
of
an
exception
to
all
other
rules,
kind
of
an
historic
bay
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
no
historic
water
claim
here,
is
there?
it's
at
least
characterized
by
the
state
of
alaska
as
something
different.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
is
not
alaska's
argument
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
to
that
extent
that
mississippi
sound
case
doesn't
help
us
all
that
much.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
we
are
dealing
here
i
guess
with
the
effects
of
the
submerged
lands
act
as
to
what
alaska
got
at
statehood.
i
mean,
we're
involved
with
the
statehood
act
and
the
submerged
lands
act
to
determine
these
coastal
boundaries
over
territorial
waters
for
alaska.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
what
you're
really
talking
about
now
with
respect
to
these
islands
and
how
you
draw
the
interconnecting
lines.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
u.s.
doesn't
totally
agree
that...
well,
doesn't
totally
disagree
that
there
may
be
inland
waters,
but
would
take
the
position
that
we
have
to
look
also
to
that
international
convention
for
what
guides
us
in
drawing
these
lines,
and
that
under
that
convention
the
arcs-of-the-circle
method
is
the
normal
rule.
i
mean,
a
country
can
deviate
from
it,
but
it's
the
normal
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
we
talk
for
a
moment
about
what
the
master's
conclusion
was
here,
and
recommendation?
did
the
master
conclude
that
the
united
states
did
have
a
policy
of
enclosing
waters
behind
islands
as
inland
waters,
where
the
strait
between
these
islands
led
to
inland
waters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
set
out
anywhere
so
we
could
follow
along
with
your
reading?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
provided
they're
no
more
than
10
miles
apart.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
territorial
water.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
this
point,
are
you
arguing
that
the
1923
executive
order
didn't
reflect
a
clear
intent
to
include
the
submerged
lands
within
the
petroleum
reserve?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
also
arguing
there
was
no
public
exigency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
argue
both,
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
language
to
that
effect
in
that
mississippi
sound
case,
certainly,
what
was
the
policy,
and
the
policy,
we
said,
was
uniformly
to
apply.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
shouldn't
go...
look
backwards,
anyway,
to
a
state
that
became
a
state
earlier
than
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
is
peculiar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
alaska
became
a
state
after
the
convention,
or
before?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
became
a
state
before.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
after.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
withdrew
that,
and
apparently
the
u.s.
consented
and
the
master
dealt
with
it,
so
that
may
be
interesting
historically,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
determines
the
issue,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
disagree
with
that?
i
mean,
the
pickett
act
was
supposed
to
apply
to
every
state,
not
just
alaska--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it
really
doesn't
speak
directly
to
submerged
lands.
now,
suppose
we
just
disagree
with
that
heavy
reliance
on
the
pickett
act.
has
it
nonetheless
been
ratified
some
way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
where
is
the
clear
expression
of
the
intent
to
affect
submerged
lands?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
alaska
says
it
only...
it
doesn't
extend
to
the
submerged
off-shore
or
territorial
waters
off
the
coast.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
the
designation
wasn't
clear
enough
in
the
original
action
that
the
u.s.
took
with
regard
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
have
been
sufficient
under
the
utah
lands
case,
or
utah
lake,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
have
met
the
utah
lake
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
it
was
possible
that
the
master
didn't
defer
adequately
to
what
utah
lake
held.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
kind
of
a
watered-down
version,
i'd
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
to
speak.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
think
it
wasn't?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
was
some
expression
maybe
in
the
utah
lands
case
in
the
opinion
itself
about
its
application
to
territorial
waters
versus
the
inland
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
the
master's
reading
6(e),
does
it
call
into
question,
not
in
this
case
but
perhaps
in
the
future,
the
ownership
of
the
uplands
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
different
theory
that
would
answer
the
case
but
not
require
that
conclusion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if...
we
might
disagree
with
that,
certainly,
in
view
of
what
the
chief
justice
addressed,
which
is
the
expressly
retained
language
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
that
might
be
enough
to
overrule
your
exceptions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
the
whole
purpose
of
the
submerged
lands
act
was
to
give
property
to
states
that
would...
on
becoming
states
that
would
defeat
the
government's
former
possible
ownership--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
purpose
was
to
convey.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we
have
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
at
least
in
this
case
we're
just
talking
about
that
strip
from
low
tide
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
long
as
we
don't
follow
precisely
the
master's
theory,
which
as
i
read
it
could
take
the
uplands
as
well,
whether
or
not
they
were
submerged,
but
if
you
were
to
rely
on
the
submerged
lands
act
provision
to
support
what
the
master
did,
at
least
on
these
lands
beyond
low
tide,
you
wouldn't
be
destroying
the
whole
reserve.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
alaska
changed
its
position
on
the
petroleum
reserve.
what's
to
prevent
some
new
person
down
the
road
from
changing
alaska's
position
on
the
refuge,
depending
on
the
theory
the
court
adopts?
