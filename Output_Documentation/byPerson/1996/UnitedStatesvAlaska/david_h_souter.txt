justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
koester,
is
it
clear
that
we
had
prior
to
that
time,
even
using
a
straight
baseline
method,
the
distance
was
always
10
miles?
i
forget
where
it
is,
but
i
thought
there
was
something
in
the
briefs
that
we
had
sometimes
used
6,
that
the
government
had
sometimes
used
6
miles.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
position
is
we...
the
government
never
had
used
6?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
you
drew
the...
if
you
draw
the
arcs
in
the
manner
in
which
the
government
suggests
you
do,
you
will
have
space
between
the
mainland
and
these
fringes
of
islands
which
by
definition
would
be
open
sea,
isn't
that
correct,
and
isn't
that
why
your
argument,
your
textual
argument,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
begs
the
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
could
you
just...
just
based
on
the
text.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
a
literal
sense
they
are
outside
of
if
they
are
enclosed
by.
in
other
words,
they
are
waters
which
are
not
within
the
zone
which
is
given
to
the
states,
waters
outside
of
them,
and
therefore
there
would
be
a
pocket
of
outer
continental
shelf
lands
sort
of
between
the
coast
and
the
islands.
i
mean,
on
a
literal
reading
i
suppose
that's
possible.
now,
it
may
not
be
the
reading
that
congress
intended.
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
say
that.
but
on
a
literal
reading,
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
usage
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
or
the
submerged
lands
act,
for
that
matter,
that
indicates
that
the
interpretation
you
have
just...
the
dichotomy
that
you
have
just
drawn
is
one
which
either
or
both
of
those
statutes
assumes?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
drilled
for
oil
under
the
submerged
lands
and
you
were
lucky,
couldn't
you
withdraw
oil
from
under
the
nonsubmerged
lands,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
that
support
the
argument
that
this
must
be
a
necessary
construction
of
the
reservation?
why
would
they
allow
you
to
sort
of
do...
in
effect
defeat
their
reservation
under
the
nonsubmerged
lands
in
such
a
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
not
so
much
talking
about
the
meaning
of
the
1923
description,
but
the
meaning
of
the
reservation
of
the
reserve,
and
don't
you
suppose
that
congress
in
its
reservation
must
have
included
submerged
lands,
or
you
would
otherwise
be
able
to
extract
the
oil
from
under
the
nonsubmerged
lands.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
there
had
been
a
formal
policy
prior
to
that
time.
if
we
accept
the
convention
as
the
touchstone
for
interpretation,
do
you
think
under
the
fourth
section
of
the
convention
it
is
simply
within
the
discretion
of
the
united
states,
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
determine
what
method
is
to
be
used
in
a
given
instance?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
point
at
which
the
government's
choice
under
article
4
becomes
clear
and
uniform
and
consistent
and
binding
for
all
the
future?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
it
that
makes
it
too
late?
this
litigation?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
about
that?
the
reason
you
say
that
had
been
done
is,
i
believe
there
was
an
application
from,
what
was
it,
the
fish
&
wildlife
service?
justice
david
h.
souter
--who
else,
in
or
outside
of
the
national
government,
might
have
made
such
an
application?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you're
right
about
this,
then
the
reservation
would
be
effective,
assuming
language
identical
to
6(e),
based
in
effect
upon
the
application
of
any
bureaucrat
in
a
state
agency.
just
file
the
application,
and
that
in
effect
would
satisfy
the
6(e)
criterion
for
otherwise
set
aside.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
your
argument
would
be
strongest
if
the
setting
apart
here
were
regarded,
or
could
be
regarded
as,
at
least
as
permanent,
or
for
that
matter
at
least
as
impermanent
as
a
withdrawal,
so
i
want
to
ask
you
about
what
withdrawal
would
entail.
could
the
united
states,
for
example,
withdraw
certain
public
lands
from
sale
following
statehood,
then
say,
well,
we've
changed
our
mind,
they
can
be
sold
now?
in
which
case,
it
would
still
be
lands
of
the
united
states
and
not
go
to
the
state.
could
that
happen?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
before
statehood.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
then
statehood,
and
then
it
says,
oh,
well,
we
don't
want
to
withdraw
them
any
more.
we
want
to
cancel
the
withdrawal.
in
which
case,
the
lands
remain
with
the
united
states,
but
they
are
subject
to
sale.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that...
if
that's
the
way
it
would
work,
then
the
withdrawal
and
the
otherwise
set
apart
would
seem
to
be
of
equal
permanence
or
impermanence,
and
i
suppose
that
would
therefore
buttress
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
government
can
change
its
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
in
order
to
do
that,
expressly
doesn't
mean
expressly.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
you're
saying
the
presumption
against
grants
should
be
used
in
construing
the
express
requirement,
and
i
don't
see
really
how
you
could
do
that
in
any
way
that
would
be
helpful
to
the
government
except
to
say,
well,
expressly
really
doesn't
mean
expressly.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
are
a
bit
further
removed
from
that
in
this
instance.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
expressly
has
to
be
watered
down
further,
or
at
least
watered
down,
i
would
suppose,
if
it's
going
to
cover
this.
certainly
one
way
to
defer
to
congress
is
to
read
the
language
that
it
uses
literally,
and
that
expressly
means
expressly.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
koester,
can
you
address
the
question
of
alaska's
position
with
respect
to
the
uplands
and
the
wildlife--
justice
david
h.
souter
--can
you
represent
that
it
is
the
position
of
alaska
that
it
will
not,
in
fact,
contest
that?
