yes,

mr.

thomas

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
four
questions
of
title
to
submerged
lands
along
the
500
miles
of
alaska's
north
coast.
the
first
question
is
whether
alaska's
boundaries
where
there
are
fringing
islands
less
than
10
miles
apart
should
be
determined
under
the
10-mile
rule
that
this
court
in
the
alabama
and
mississippi
boundary
case
found
was
the
united
states
policy
from
1903
to
1961,
a
period
during
which
alaska
became
a
state,
or
under
the
more
limiting
arcs-of-circles
method
that
the
united
states
first
applied
to
fringing
islands
in
1971.
the
second
question
is
whether
dinkum
sands,
an
alluvial
feature
similar
to
the
mudlumps
off
the
louisiana
coast
that
the
court
in
the
louisiana
boundary
case
found
were
islands,
is
an
island...
whether
dinkum
sands
is
an
island.
the
third
question
is
whether
congress
in
section
11(b)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
defeated
alaska's
title
to
the
lands
underlying
coastal
lagoons
in
the
national
petroleum
reserve,
alaska.
and
the
final
question
is
whether
congress
in
section
6(e)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
defeated
alaska's
title
to
the
coastal
lagoons
in
the
vicinity
of
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge.
an
application
for
the
refuge
had
been
filed
before
statehood,
but
the
refuge
was
not
established
until
after
statehood.
the
court
has
addressed
strikingly
similar
issues
in
prior
submerged
lands
cases
that
date
back
more
than
150
years.
on
each
of
the
four
questions
presented
here,
the
united
states
asks
the
court
to
depart
from
those
prior
decisions.
the
court
should
reject
the
united
states'
invitation
and
treat
alaska
as
it
has
treated
other
states.
the
first
question
here
is
whether
the
parties'
submerged
lands
ownership
in
areas
enclosed
by
near-shore
fringing
islands
should
be
determined
under
the
10-mile
rule
or
the
arcs-of-circles
method.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
we're
speaking
of
near-shore
fringing
islands
that
enclose
a
water
body,
and
not
islands
that
are
an
archipelago
or
peninsula
that
stick
out
into
the
sea.
the
consequences--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
that's
the
alabama
and
mississippi
boundary
case
that--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--the
ultimate
decision
in
that
case
was
that
mississippi
sound
constituted
historic
waters.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
historic
waters
claim
requires
a
demonstration
of
asserted
jurisdiction
over
a
period
of
time
and
acquiescence--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--that
is
correct.
we
do
not
have
the
historic--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--it
does
in
this
respect,
justice
o'connor,
and
that
is
that
in
the
mississippi
sound
case
the
court
found
as
a
fact...
not
as
necessarily
a
legal
principle,
but
as
a
fact
that
the
united
states'
policy
from
1901
to
19...
from
1903
until
1961
was
to
employ
this
10-mile
rule
to
delimit
its
inland
waters.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
not
in
our
submission.
a
very
relevant
fact.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
it
certainly
supported
the
court's
decision
in
that
case.
the
court
said,
we
do
not
need
to
rely
solely
on
this
historic
policy,
because
we
have
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
the
historic
policy
specific
assertions
of
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
mississippi
sound,
but
it
was
one
of
the
facts
that
laid
the
predicate
for
the
court's
finding
that
mississippi
sound
was
historic
waters.
the
consequences
of
using
these
two
delimitation
methods
in
stefansson
sound
are
shown
in
the
master's
figures
3.2
and
3.4,
which
we
have
reproduced
in
our
surreply
brief
opposite
page
22,
so
you
can...
opposite
page
2,
i'm
sorry,
so
that
you
can
get
a
sense
of
the
differences
in
outcome.
under
the
10-mile
rule,
stefansson
sound
and
other
areas
enclosed
by
islands
are
inland
waters.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
where
there
are
no
inland
waters,
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
submerged
lands
act
defines
the
coastline
from
which
the
state's--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--with
respect
to
these
islands,
it
is
our
submission
that
the
water
areas
landward
of
the
islands
are
inland
waters,
and
that
alaska's
title
passed...
title
to
those
lands
passed
to
alaska
as
a
consequence
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine
because
they
are
inland
waters.
the
submerged
lands
act--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--it
is
called
the
normal
baseline.
the
evidence
in
our
case
shows
that
among
those
countries
with
coastlines
amenable
to
the
use
of
the
alternative
method
in
the
convention,
the
straight
baseline
method,
the
united
states
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
that
does
not
employ
that
method,
that
has
no
particular
foreign
policy
reason
for
not
doing
so.
the
evidence
in
our
case
also
shows
that
the
united
states
has
made
a
determination,
the
state
department
legal
advisor
made
a
determination
in
1971
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
united
states
not
to
use
straight
baselines
less
than
10
miles
long
in
southeast
alaska,
where
the
10-mile
rule
had
its
origin
in
the
1903
alaska
boundary
arbitration.
so
we
have
a
situation
where
the
united
states
from
1903
to
1961
used
a
delimitation
method
that
provided
these
lands
were
inland
waters,
that
was
in
existence
when
alaska
joined
the
union
in
1959,
and
in
1971,
for
the
first
time,
moved
to
the
arcs-of-circles
method
that
creates
these
enclaves
and
pockets
which
the
state
department
in
1930
described
as
anomalous,
objectionable,
and
undesirable,
and
with
no
perceivable
foreign
policy
reason
for
making
this
change.
the
inference
which
we
draw
from
this
is
that
following
the
court's
adoption
of
the
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
contiguous
zone
in
1965
for
submerged
lands
purposes,
the
only
reason
the
united
states
changed
from
the
10-mile
rule
to
the
method
of
arcs
of
circles
was
because
it
gave
it
an
advantage
in
these
cases
where
the
geography
of
the
coastline
is
like
the
geography
of
alaska's
north
slope.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
evidence
we
have
to
support
it
is
that
in
1971
the
state
department
legal
advisor
said
we...
there
is
no
foreign
policy
justification...
the
factual
predicate
was,
the
united
states
published
a
series
of
charts
in
1971
that
for
the
first
time
showed
this
arcs-of-circles
method
being
used
in
areas
where
it
would
create
these
pockets
and
enclaves.
one
of
those
areas
was
southeast
alaska.
alaska
protested
vigorously
and
loud,
and
the
united
states
did
a
relatively
serious
job
of
considering
whether
it
should,
in
fact,
revert
to
its
earlier
practice
of
employing
the
10-mile
rule
to
enclose
these
areas
as
inland
waters.
the
state
department
legal
advisor
determined
that
there
was
no
foreign
policy
justification
for
failing
to
do
so.
there
was
no
foreign
policy
justification
to
refuse
alaska's
request
that
the
united
states
return
to
its
earlier
practice.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
i
think
the
united
states
could
do
that
in
its
international
relations.
the
problem
is
the
10-mile
rule
was
the
united
states
policy
at
the
time
alaska
was
admitted
and,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in...
in
the
corvallis
land
and...
corvallis
sand
&
gravel
company
case,
a
state's
title
to
lands
underlying
inland
navigable
waters
vests...
and
i'm
quoting...
absolutely
as
at
the
time
of
its
admission,
and
is
not
subject
to
later
defeasance.
that's
found
at
429
united
states
report
at
370
and
371.
so
if
the
10-mile
rule
was
the
united
states
policy
in
1959,
when
alaska
was
admitted,
and
these
lands
were
inland
waters
at
that
time,
under
that
policy,
alaska's
title
vested
absolutely--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--and
is
not
subject
to
later
defeasance.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
our
evidence,
and
the
evidence
that
we
cite,
shows
a
consistent
10-mile
rule
at
least
from
the
time
of
the
alaska
boundary
arbitration.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that
is
correct,
and
the
manner
in
which
this
10-mile
rule
for
fringing
islands
came
about
was
first
in
the
1903
boundary
arbitration
the
united
states
said,
all
of
these
waters
in
southeast
alaska
are
inland
waters.
they're
inland
lakes.
they're
inland
seas.
as
the
united
states
had
said
to
cuba
in
1863,
your
archipelago
de
los
canarreos
are
islands
that
enclose
an
inland
water
and
an
inland
sea,
as
much
a
lake
as
any
inland
lake.
southeast
alaska
was
the
same
thing.
in
1930,
at
the
hague
codification
conference,
the
united
states
10
miles
apart
the
rule
for
bays
applies,
the
10-mile
rule.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy,
because
from
that
point
forward
the
united
states
made
several
pronouncements
of
what
it
referred
to
as
a
general
rule.
in
fact,
it
made
a
pronouncement
of,
this
is
the
general
rule
except
in
one
limited
circumstance,
and
that
is
where
the
area
enclosed
by
the
islands
is
what
is
known
as
an
international
strait,
a
passageway
connecting
two
areas
of
high
seas.
otherwise,
the
united
states
pointed
out...
this
was
in
its
1964
brief
in
the
california
litigation,
so
this
was
after
alaska's
admission.
it
said
the
only
time
this
is
not
the
general
rule
is
where
you
have
an
international
strait,
and
stefansson
sound
and
none
of
the
areas
on
alaska's
north
slope
are
international
straits.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
our
reading
of
the
master's
report
is
that
he
did
not
find
a
policy.
he
did
not
find
that
the
united
states
had
a
policy,
and
it
was
really
on
that
basis,
in
effect
on
a
default
methodology,
that
because
the
united
states
had
no
policy,
alaska
cannot
assert
now
that
it
did.
we
believe
the
evidence
demonstrates
that
the
court
in
the
alabama
and
mississippi
boundary
case
was
correct,
that
the
10-mile
rule
was,
in
fact,
the
united
states'
policy.
there's
another
basis,
though--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--the
united...
at
the
hague
conference
in
1930
the
united
states
made
a
proposal
which
included
a
number
of
different
provisions,
one
of
which
was,
in
order
to
eliminate
these
objectionable,
anomalous,
and
undesirable
pockets
that
result
from
the
application
of
the
arcs-of-circles
methods,
that
they
be
assimilated
to
the
territorial
sea.
that
approach
seems
appropriate
where
you
have
an
international
strait,
to
assimilate
it
to
the
territorial
sea.
that
leaves
a
right
of
innocent
passage,
which
is
what
the
united
states
has
always
insisted
on
as
a
maritime
nation.
but
where
it
does
not
connect--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--it
is...
in
the
limited
exception
that
the
united
states
pointed
out
in
1964,
was
the
only
exception
to
the
10-mile
rule,
and
that
is
for
these
international
straits.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
it
was
based
on
a
10-mile
distance
limitation,
but
it
coexisted
with
the
other
provision,
which
was
a
10...
where
straits
between
islands
led
to
inland
seas,
the
rule
applying
to
bays
would
apply,
and
that
was
a
10-mile
rule,
to
find
that
they
were
inland
waters.
so
what
you
have
were
two
different
alternatives,
the
two
different
alternatives
that
in
terms
of
general
principles
have
existed
throughout
united
states
policy.
one
is
a
10-mile
rule
for
inland
waters,
a
10-mile
rule
delimiting
inland
waters,
where
there
is
no
need
for
a
right
of
innocent
passage
to
connect
to
areas
of
high
seas,
and
the
alternative,
the
assimilation
method,
where
there
is
a
need,
because
the
area
fringed
by
the
islands
connects
to
areas
of
high
seas.
there's
a
second
reason
that
alaska's
position
on
the
10-mile
rule
should
be
sustained
by
the
court
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
and
that
is
that
the
language
of
the
submerged
lands
act
is
consistent
with
the
10-mile
rule,
but
it
does
not
allow
room
for
the
arcs-of-circles
method
under
the
act.

mr.

the

defines
the
coastline
from
which
state
submerged
lands
entitlement
is
measured
the
statutory
grant
to
the
states
is
measured,
as...
and
i'm
quoting
from
section
1(c)
of
the
act...
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
along
that
portion
of
the
coast
which
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea,
and
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters.
under
the
10-mile
rule,
the
coastline
consists
of
the
seaward
shore--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--that's
correct.
sorry,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
under
the
10-mile
rule,
the
coastline
for
submerged
lands
act
purposes
would
consist
of
the
seaward
shore
of
the
fringing
islands.
that
is
the
shore
of
those
islands
that
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea,
and
straight
lines
connecting
the
islands.
that
is,
the
seaward
limit
of
the
inland
waters
that
are
enclosed
by
those
islands.
under
the
arcs--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
under
the
arcs-of-circles
method
the
coastline
would
include
the
shore
of
the
islands
that
faces
the
mainland,
the
shore
that
is
not
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea.
as
a
result,
under
the
act's
definition
of
coastline--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--it
begs
the
question
until
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
dawson
amendment--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--whether
congressman--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--unless
one
uses
the
plain
and
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words.
if
the
islands
are
less
than
10
miles
apart,
they
are
very
close
to
the
shore,
they
enclose
water
that
is
protected
from
the
storms
and
the
other
weather
influences,
safe
harbor,
if
you
will,
for
mariners,
it
is
not
in
contact
with
the
open
sea
because
it
is
broken
off
from
the
open
sea.
it
is
divided
from
the
open
sea
by
these
islands,
so
under
the...
what
we
believe
a
plain
language
interpretation
of
this
definition--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--the
history
of
the
united
states
foreign
policy
until
1971
is--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--based
on
the
text,
in
our
view
the
open
sea
is
seaward
of
the
islands.
one
can
look,
if
i
may
depart
from
the
text
of
the
submerged
lands
act
to
the
text
of
the
related
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
were
enacted
not
simultaneously
but
nearly
so.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
clearly
is
in
para
materia
with
the
submerged
lands
act,
and
what
congress
tried
to
do
was
to
establish
the
dividing
line
between
state-owned
off-shore
submerged
lands
and
the
federal
outer
continental
shelf.
it
defined
the
coastline
as
i
have
just
read.
it
defined
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
the
federal
outer
continental
shelf
as
consisting
of
those
lands
that
are
seaward
and
outside
of...
and
that's
a
direct
quote...
seaward
and
outside
of
those
conveyed
to
the
states
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
if
one
has
a
coastline
for
submerged
lands
act
purposes
that
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea,
and
the
only
federal
outer
continental
shelf
are
lands
that
are
seaward
and
outside
of
those
lands
transferred
to
the
state
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
alaska
does
not
see
how
these
pockets
and
enclaves,
which
have
never
been
claimed
by
the
united
states
until
1971,
somehow
now
are
seaward
and
outside
of
the
lands
conveyed
to
the
states.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
i
beg
to
differ
only
to
this
extent,
and
that
is,
under
a
normal
interpretation
these
pockets
and
enclaves
would
be
landward
and
inside-of
because
they
are,
in
fact,
surrounded.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
i
believe
in
our
brief
at
the
page
i
cited
there's
legislative
history
from
the
senators
showing
that
they
considered
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
open
sea.
so
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea,
in
that
geographic
circumstance,
in
their
view
was
the
open
gulf
of
mexico
and
only
the
seaward
shore
of
the
islands
would
count
as
part
of
the
coastline
for
submerged
lands
act
purposes.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
three
miles
from--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--base
points.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
it--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--not
when
the
united
states
foreign
policy
which
was
in
existence
on
the
date
of
alaska's
statehood,
the
date
that
alaska's
title
to
submerged
lands
underlying
inland
waters
vested
absolutely,
not
subject
to
later
defeasance,
was
to
claim
those
areas
as
inland
waters.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
enclaves
and
pockets.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
lagoons
in
the
national
petroleum
reserve
alaska,
if
i
may.
alaska
makes
two
points
on
this
question.
first,
nothing
in
section
11(b)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
on
which
the
united
states
relies
shows
a
clear
intent
to
include
submerged
lands
in
the
petroleum
reserve
or
an
affirmative
intent
to
defeat
alaska's
title
to
those
lands.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
we're
talking
here
about
fee
title.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
of
section
11(b)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
shows
an
affirmative
congressional
intent
that
all
submerged
lands
in
alaska
would
pass
to
alaska
at
statehood.
second--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--my
understanding
of
the
united
states'
position
is
that
they
insist
on
fee
title,
that
fee
title
is
reserved
from
the
state.
second,
our
second
point
is
that
nothing
in
section
11(b)
expressly
retained...
and
that's
the
phrase
used
in
the
exception
to
the
submerged
lands
act
found
in
section
5(a)
of
the
submerged
lands
act...
nothing
in
section
(b)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
expressly
retained
submerged
lands
in
the
petroleum
reserve.
as
with
the
equal
footing
doctrine
issue,
there's
affirmative
express
direct
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
that
congress
intended
all
submerged
lands
to
pass
to
alaska.
as
to
the
first
point,
there
is
no
dispute
that
there
are
some
lands
in
the
petroleum
reserve
subject
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
tidelands
and
juridical
bays.
they
are
inland
navigable
waters,
subject
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine
even
following
the
court's
1947
california
decision,
which
held
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
does
not
extend
off-shore.
in
these
equal
footing
doctrine
cases,
the
court
has
established
a
strong
presumption
of
state
title
to
such
lands.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that
is
part
of
the
issue
in
the
case,
justice
kennedy.
we
believe
the
same
presumption
extends
off-shore
but
only
by
virtue
of
the
submerged
lands
act....
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
the
way
we
read
the
parties'
position,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that
is
our
view.
we
believe
they
are
quite
similar.
in
fact,
if
anything,
the
expressly
retained
exception
in
the
submerged
lands
act
would
seem
to
impose
a
more
stringent
test
on
the
united
states.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
we
believe
it
would,
and
we
believe
that
would
comport
with
the
intent
of
congress
that
we
set
out
in
our
reply
brief,
that
congress
intended
to
extend
the
principles
underlying
the
court's
equal
footing
doctrine
decisions
offshore.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct.
because
of
the
presumption
of
state
title
as
to
equal
footing
doctrine
lands,
the
court
in
its
1987
utah
decision
held
that
the
united
states
must
make
two
showings
before
pre-statehood
withdrawal
and
reservation
of
public
lands
defeats
state
title.
first,
it
must
show
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
include
submerged
lands
in
the
withdrawal
and
reservation
and,
second,
it
must
show
that
congress
affirmatively
intended
to
defeat
state
title.
the
court
has
never
held
that
a
pre-statehood
federal
withdrawal
and
reservation
has
defeated
state
title,
and
the
united
states
has
made
neither
of
the
showings
required
by
utah
here.
congress
did
not
clearly
intend
to
include
submerged
lands
in
the
petroleum
reserve.
the
pickett
act
was
the
authority
under
which
the
executive
withdrew
and
reserved
the
petroleum
reserve.
it
authorized
the
withdrawal
and
reservation
of
public
lands
which,
like
the
statute
at
issue
in
the
utah
case,
do
not
include
submerged
lands.
the
withdrawal
is
a
withdrawal
from
disposal,
and
public
lands
have
never
been
subject
to
disposal
under
the
general
land
laws.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
executive
order
in
our
view
does
not
do
it,
because--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--except
the
executive
order
was
promulgated
under
the
picket
act.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
well,
to
us
the
question
is
not
answered
by
looking
at
what
section
11(b)
does.
it
reserves
whatever
lands
were
held
as
a
petroleum
reserve
under
the
executive
order,
and
the
executive
order
in
turn
did
not
include
the
submerged
lands.
nothing
in
the
order
refers
to
submerged
lands,
nothing
in
the
pickett
act
authorized
withdrawal
of
submerged
lands--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--which
in
our
view
did
not
include
the
submerged
lands
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reserve.
nothing...
the
fact
the
submerged
lands
were
included
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reserve
tells
us
nothing
about
whether
the
lands
themselves
were
withdrawn
and
reserved.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct,
and
it
held
the
submerged
lands
in
trust
for
the
future
state
of
alaska.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
certainly
possible.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
in
1923,
there
was
no
proposal
for
a
new
state
of
alaska,
and
the
united
states
always
has
the
commerce
clause
power
to
prevent
and
protect
activities
in--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--if
one
looks
to
a
necessary
implication,
one
runs
afoul
of
the
terms
of
the
submerged
lands
act
5(a)
exception
that
the
united
states
relies
on
for
lands
that
are
expressly
retained.
a
reservation
by
implication
is
not
an
express
retention.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
they're--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--we
don't
believe
it
is
express,
because
there's
no
reference
to
submerged
lands.
again,
the
fact
that
submerged
lands
are
included
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
withdrawal
and
reservation
says
nothing
about
whether
the
submerged
lands
themselves
were
included.
in
both
the
1981
montana
case
and
the
1987
utah
case
the
exterior
boundaries
at
issue
encompassed
submerged
lands.
in
both
those
cases--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--right.
at
this
point
we're
talking
equal
footing
doctrine
lands,
which
it
is
conceded
there
are
some,
the
tidelands
and
the
bays,
the
juridical
bays,
and
in
both
utah
and
montana
the
court
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
exterior
boundaries
encompass
submerged
lands
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
were
included
in
the
federal
action.
in
the
indian
reservation
in
the
montana
case,
title
was
found
to
be
in
the
state,
despite
the
fact
that
the
boundary
of
the
reservation
ran
down
the
middle
of
the
river.
in
the
utah
case,
the
bed
of
utah
lake
was
found
to
have
transferred
to
utah
at
statehood,
despite
the
fact
that
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reservoir
site
that
had
been
withdrawn
and
reserved
included
those
submerged
lands.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
they
did
indeed,
and--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--it
seems
that
the
boundary
description
reflected,
turning
just
for
the
moment
back
to
the
first
issue,
a
policy
of
drawing
the
coastline
along
the
seaward
shore
islands
and
across
the
water
entrances
in
between.
it
included,
of
course,
as
a
consequence,
the
uplands
of
those
islands.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct,
and
they
clearly
included
the
islands
within
the
petroleum
reserve,
those
above
the
line
of
ordinary
high
water.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
congress
incorporated--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--we
do
not
believe
there
was
a
public
exigency,
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
yes,
that
is
correct,
and
congress
incorporated
the
terms
of
the
executive
order
when
it
enacted
section
11(b),
so
the
question...
the
issue,
even
as
to
what
congress
intended,
comes
down
to
what
did
the
1923
executive
order
do?
well,
particularly
with
respect
to
section
11(b),
the
legislative
history
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
shows
no
intent
to
reserve
submerged
lands.
in
fact,
quite
the
contrary,
and
if
i
may
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
statutory
confirmation
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
section
5(a)
exception
to
the
submerged
lands
act
grant
is
even
more
stringent
that
the
utah
lake
test.
it
is
for
lands
that
are
expressly
retained.
if
one
looks
at
the
alaska
statehood
act,
there
is
one
instance--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--at
page
432
of
the
master's
report.
in
terms
of
expressed
retention
from
alaska's
submerged
lands
act
grant,
congress
considered
only
one
in
all
of
the
debates
leading
up
to
statehood,
and
that
was
for
a
proposed
amendment
to
the
section
that
made
the
submerged
lands
act
applicable
to
alaska
that
would
have
expressly
retained
a
right
of
access
to
navigable
waters
for
government
timber
contractors
in
southeast
alaska,
as
discussed
in
our
reply
brief,
the
orange
brief,
at
pages
45
and
46.
even
that
narrow
express
retention
under
the
submerged
lands
act
was
not
in
the
bill
as
finally
passed
by
congress
and
as
it
became
law,
so
congress
did,
in
fact,
consider
one
express
retention,
and
it
did
not
enact
it.
there
is
nothing
that
says
anywhere,
in
either
the
text
of
section
11(b)
or
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
that
congress
intended
to
retain
submerged
lands
in
the
petroleum
reserve.
the
united
states
as
a
consequence
relies
on
inference,
and
inferred
retention
is
not
an
express
retention.
and
the
united
states,
justice
kennedy,
as
you
pointed
out,
seems
to
be
trying
to
do
away
with
the
presumption
in
favor
of
the
states
as
to
inland
waters.
this
is
a
rule
that
we
urge
the
court
to
reject,
and
the
court's
jurisprudence
for
150
years
has
found
a
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
state
title.
for
those
states
that
were
admitted
after
the
submerged
lands
act,
if
there
is
no
such
presumption,
the
new
states
are
not
admitted
on
an
equal
footing,
and
it's
that
simple.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
under
the
section
5(a)
exception
to
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
lands
must
be
expressly
retained.
either
they're
expressly
retained--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
certainly
just
as
the
federal
enclave
of
the
district
includes
private
property,
or
property
not
owned
by
the
federal
government,
there
is
nothing
that
would
preclude
the
transfer
of
title
to
the
state
that
would
detract
from
congress'
power
to
exercise
its
constitutional
authority
to
enact
exclusive
legislation.
if
i
could
turn
just
briefly
to
the
dinkum
sands
issue,
and
then
reserve
my
remaining
time,
the
court
in
the
louisiana
boundary
case
has
said
the
mississippi
mudlumps
are
islands.
dinkum
sands
is
at
least
as
substantial
and
permanent
as
the
mississippi
mudlumps
and,
if
they
are
islands,
dinkum
sands
should
be,
too.
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
thank
you,
chief
justice.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
certainly.
that
was
one
of
the
things
i
wanted
to
begin
with.
alaska
never
had
a
right
or
an
entitlement
to
any
of
the
uplands.
the
uplands
have
been
withdrawn
from
private
entry
and
sale
by
virtue
of
the
application,
and
upon
the
creation
of
the
wildlife
refuge
following
statehood....
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
there
is
now
a
fully
effectuated
federal
withdrawal
and
reservation
in
place,
and
that's
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge,
and
it's
not
open
to
sale
or
entry
or
other
kind
of
disposal.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
regulations
provided
that
the
lands
be
withdrawn
from
the
operation
of
disposal
statutes,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
we
have
not
contested
it.
we
do
not
believe
there's
anything
that--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--i
can
represent
that
i
will
urge
alaska
not
to
because
i
don't
believe
the
law
would
permit
it.
i
don't
believe
a
reasonable
argument
can
be
made.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
withdrawal
was
sufficient
for
the
uplands
in
that
they
were
withdrawn
from
private
disposal
statutes
and
remain
so
withdrawn
until
the
refuge
was
created
after
statehood.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
distinguishing
feature
is
that
section
6(e)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
only
addresses
fully
established
refuges
on
the
date
of
statehood.
the
purpose
of
6(e)
was
not
to
retain
federal
wildlife
refuges
in
state
ownership.
the
purpose
of
section
6(e)
was
to
transfer
facilities
used
in
wildlife
management
to
the
state.
the
reservation
that
the
united
states
relies
on
said
in
making
those
transfers
the
only
lands
we
are
not
going
to
transfer
are
wildlife
refuges,
but
it
said
nothing
about
transfers
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
or
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
in
other
words,
the
proviso
in
section
6(e)
was
a
very
limited
exception
to
the
relatively
limited
6(e)
transfer
of
property
to
the
state.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
same
two
basic
arguments
that
we
made
with
respect
to
the
petroleum
reserve
apply
here.
first,
there's
no
clear
intent
to
defeat
alaska's
title,
and
there
is
no
express
retention
of
any
submerged
lands
in
section
6(e).
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
no
clear
intent
in
section
6(e)
to
defeat--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--alaska's
title
to
the
submerged
lands.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
that's
the
only
provision
that
the
united
states
argues
defeated
alaska's
title,
and
there's
nothing
there
that
does.
if
i
may
just
make
a
last
comment
on
the
baselines
issue,
and
that
is,
when
the
court
adopted
the
convention
and
applied
it
to
california
and
louisiana,
it
did
not
result
in
a
contraction
of
those
states'
territory.
applying
the
arcs-of-circles
method
under
the
convention
to
alaska
would
result
in
a
contraction
of
the
state's
territory.
the
result
we
are
seeking
here
is
the
same
result
the
court
afforded
louisiana
with
respect
to
chandeleur
sound,
and
alabama
and
mississippi
with
respect
to
mississippi
sound.
we
believe
the
principle
of
stare
decisis
has
considerable
force
and
perhaps
additional
significance
when
dealing
with
the
rights
of
the
states,
because
they
are
entitled
to
admission
on
an
equal
footing,
and
they're
entitled
to
equal
treatment
in
this
case.
thank
you.
