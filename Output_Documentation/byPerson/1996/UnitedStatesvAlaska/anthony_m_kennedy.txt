justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
your
position
is
that
that's
a
general
rule.
there
does
not
have
to
be
a
showing
of
some
special
circumstance
to
justify
its
application
in
a
particular
case,
like
a
historic
bay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
we
talking
about
mineral
rights
and
being
a
federal
enclave,
or
are
we
talking
about
fee
title,
or
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the...
does
the
united
states
ask
for
fee
title
to
the
lands
we're
talking
about,
or
just
petroleum
development,
or
mineral
rights?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
does
that
apply
to
lands
under...
submerged
lands
under
territorial
waters
or
to
submerged
lands
under
inland
waters,
or
is
that
part
of
the
issue
in
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you
want
to
push
the
presumption
into
territorial
waters,
and
the
united
states
wants
to
somehow
defeat
the
presumption
under
inland
waters.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
no
decision
of
this
court
which
would
support
that
specifically.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
statute
says,
including
naval
petroleum
reserve
number
4.
it's
very
specific.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
at
the
time
the
government
took
them,
the
government
owned
all
the
lands
anyway.
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
differentiating
between
the
two.
it
owned
everything.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
drawing
of
the
petroleum
reserve
would
be
for
the
purposes
of
extracting
the
petroleum
in
the
areas
which
had
the
greatest
potential
for
petroleum,
i
assume.
i
don't
see
why
they
would
just
follow
the
10-mile
rule,
assuming
that
that's
the
rule
they
followed.
they're
interested
in
oil,
not
boundaries.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
6(e)
is
more
specific
than
6(m)
and
therefore
trumps
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
we
thought
it
was
not
expressly
retained
under
6(m),
do
you
still
think
you
would
prevail
under
6(e)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
alaska
has
not
conceded
ownership
of
the
uplands
in
the
united
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
that
square
with
the
equal
footing
doctrine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
that
withdrawal
under
6(e)
was
sufficient
for
the
uplands.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
there
in
the
withdrawal
process
that
distinguished
between
the
submerged
lands
and
the
uplands,
just
the
submerged
lands
act?
