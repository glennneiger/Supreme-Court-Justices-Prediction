justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
their
strongest
argument
from
where
i
sit
was
that
congress
ratified
the
withdrawal
of
the
reserve
in
section
11(b)
of
the
act.
that
is,
they
said
that,
is
this
right
that
11(b)
says
that
we
reserve
for
exclusive
legislative...
in
other
words,
we
keep
the
acts
that
are
owned
by
the
united
states
and
held,
including
the
petroleum
reserve
is
there
too,
whether
they
were
required
by
cession
and
transfer,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
or
by
act
of
congress,
or
by
executive
order.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
then
they'd
have
to
show,
was
there
an
executive
order
that
put
aside
the
petroleum
reserve,
and
then
the
government
points
to
an
executive
order
that
seems
to
do
it,
and
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
so
we
just
have
to
focus
on
the
executive
order.
the
pickett
act
and
so
forth
is
beside
the
point
if
this
other
later
11(b)
provides
the
necessary
statutory
authority,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
be,
but
they
have
it
there,
and
maybe
they
didn't
have
authority
under
the
pickett
act,
but
still
there'd
be
an
executive
order
and
it
would
have
been
ratified
later
on
by
section
11(b).
the
statehood
act
makes
any
argument
under
the
picket
act
irrelevant.
yes.
that's
my
point.
and
after
all,
the
statehood
act
was
passed
by
congress,
and
the
earlier
action
under
the
pickett
act
was
by
the
president
alone
under
some
authority,
whatever
authority
it
had,
but
once
it
is
clear
that
congress
has
said
explicitly,
for
example
in
the
statehood
act,
that
that
is
held
back
to
the
united
states,
how
do
you
prevail?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
not...
i
gather
the
boundary
in
the
executive
order
goes
along
the
ocean
side
of
the
sand
spits
and
islands
forming
the
barrier
reef?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
all
right,
so
they
must
have
had
some
idea
what
they
were
enclosing,
and
it
sounds
as
if
you
say,
it
goes
along
the
island,
they're
enclosing
the
water.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they're
saying
you
have
to
go
down
through
the
land
under
the
water
to
get
to
the
oil,
so
wouldn't
that
be
pretty
express?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
people
know
at
that
time
that
oil
was
likely
to
be
under
the
water?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
why
if
you're
having
an
oil
reserve
and
you
draw
the
boundary
across
the
lagoon,
for
example,
what
could
you
have
had
in
mind
if
you
weren't
trying
to
get
the
oil
that's
underneath
the
water?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
under
the...
the
difficulty
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
is,
if
you...
suppose
there's
a
territory,
and
the
congress
draws
a
circle
somewhere
in
that
territory
that's
to
be
a
park.
now,
it
might
be
that
congress
when
they
made
that
park
did
not
intend
clearly
to
retain
the
submerged
lands
in
the
park,
but
they
did
clearly
intend
to
make
the
submerged
lands
part
of
the
park.
retention
is
different
from
what
you
create,
so
where
does
the
clearness
about
retention
have
to
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
have
the
clearness
of
the
retention
in
section
11--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
section...
well,
you
go
ahead.
forget
it.
i'll
deal
with
it.
mr.
koester,
reading
11(b)
as
set
forth
in
the
master's
report
at
4...
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
argue
that
that's
not
talking
about
property
at
all.
it's
talking
about
governance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
a
contested
issue?
that
is,
i
hadn't
focused
on
that.
the
act,
11(b)
refers
to
tracts
set
aside
by
executive
order.
that's
the
subject
matter.
then
it
says
what
will
happen
to
those
tracts,
and
it
says
those
tracts
set
aside
by
executive
order
are
reserved
for
the
exercise
by
congress
of
exclusive
legislation.
that's
what
happens
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
there
an
issue
in
those
case
as
to
whether
those
latter
words,
setting
aside
a
tract
for
exclusive
legislation,
amounts
to
reservation
of
ownership?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
that
a
contested
issue?
is
it
that
you
have
one
position
and
they
have
the
other?
that
is,
do
i
have
to
focus
on
that
question
and
decide
whether
or
not
reserving
for
the
power
of
exclusive
legislation
by
congress
either
does
amount
to
keeping
ownership
of
the
land
or
it
doesn't?
i
don't
have
to
decide
it,
however,
unless
the
two
parties
are
in
disagreement
about
it.
are
they
in
disagreement
about
that
as
this
case
comes
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
read
the
briefs
more
thoroughly
than
i.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
argue
that
point
in
the
briefs
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
they
conceded,
or
is...
do
we
have
to
decide...
in
respect
to
this
objection
of
yours,
your
exception,
is
the
issue
before
us
simply
the
issue
of
interpreting
the
words,
set
apart
as
a
refuge...
interpreting
6(e),
the
proviso,
in
other
words.
otherwise
set
aside?
yes,
et
cetera.
are
we
just
interpreting
the
words
of
that,
or
are
there
other
alternative
arguments
that
alaska
has
made
that
we'd
also
have
to
decide,
such
as
there
isn't
enough
authority
anyway,
or
a
whole
set
of
other
arguments
that
might
be
made?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
boundary.
you
didn't
except
to
that.
they'd
have
to
have
excepted
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
haven't
produced
other
alternative
bases
for
affirming
except
the
master's
interpretation
of
6(e)
is
right,
and
yours
is
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
one
factual
question,
if
you
know
the
answer.
when
congress
passed
6(e),
the
applications
had
already
been
made
but
they
hadn't
been
approved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
were
there
other
applications
for
setting
aside
as
a
wildlife
refuge
that
had
also
been
made,
other
than
this
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in...
he
didn't
go
forward
with
it.
since
he
didn't
go
forward
with
the
application,
if
statehood
intervened,
then
the
fact
that
he
didn't
go
forward
with
it
wouldn't
matter.
the
united
states
would
still
own
it
on
your
theory.
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right,
but
there...
as
far
as
factually
is
concerned,
as
far
as
you
know
there's
only
this
in
front
of
us
and
this
aleutian
island
one,
and
there
weren't
a
lot
of
other
applications.
you
don't
know
of
any
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
urged...
i
understand
that
argument,
and
i'm
very
interested
in
knowing
whether
you
have
alternative
theories,
because
i'm
just
trying
to
limit
what
it
is
i'd
have
to
decide,
and
your
argument
i
understand.
it's
whether
that
preliminary
application
was
or
was
not
within
6(e),
and
that's
what
you'd
seem
to
argue.
now,
there
are
alternative
theories
on
this
point
that
you're
arguing,
or
again,
i
figure
once
i've
decided
that
one
i
don't
have
to
go
further.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
clear
intent
in
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
6(e).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so...
but
i
can
focus
right
on
6(e).
i
don't
have
to
focus
on
some
other
thing.
