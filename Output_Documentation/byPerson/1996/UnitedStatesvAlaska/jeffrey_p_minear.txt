mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
first
to
respond
to
alaska's
three
exceptions
in
the
order
that
they
are
presented
in
alaska's
brief.
i
will
then
address
the
united
states
exception
respecting
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge.
in
its
first
exception,
alaska
challenges
the
master's
determination
of
the
limits
of
inland
waters
in
the
area
between
the
alaska
mainland
and
a
series
of
barrier
islands
that
fringe
the
arctic
coast.
the
master
determined
those
by
applying
the
applicable
rules
from
the
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
the
contiguous
zone.
he
rejected
alaska's
contention
that
the
issue
should
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
what
alaska
calls
the
10-mile
rule
which,
according
to
alaska,
was
the
policy
of
the
united
states
respecting
islands
at
the
time
of
alaska's
statehood.
the
master's
recommendation--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
there
was
that
statement
in
the
alabama
and
mississippi
sound
case,
and
i
think
that
is
simply
that.
it's
simply
a
passing
statement.
it
doesn't
control
this
issue.
we
think
the
master's
recommendation
is
correct--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--first
of
all,
because
it
was
not
essential
to
the
decision
in
that
case.
second,
it
must
be
interpreted
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
used.
the
mississippi
and
alabama
boundary
case
involved
mississippi
sound,
and
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
historic
inland
waters
for
purposes
of
the
convention.
the
court
was
applying
the
convention
in
that
case,
and
was
examining
whether
there
had
been
continuous
dominion
over
mississippi
sound
with
the
acquiescence
of
foreign
nations.
it
made
that
statement
in
that
context
and,
as
the
special
master
pointed
out,
when
it
made
the
statement
it
made
it
in
a
very
general
sense.
it
wasn't
distinguishing
a
law
between,
for
instance,
a
strait
that
leads
to
an
inland
sea,
which
could
arguably
have
been
the
policy,
or
a
case
of
islands
involving--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
the
court
would
have
reached
the
same
decision--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
i
think
that's
probably
fair
to
say
that
the
court
considered
that
as
a
minor
factor,
but
not
one
that
would
have
influenced
the
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it
was
wrong,
and
i
think
that
the
alabama
and
mississippi
boundary
case
is
actually
in
tension
with
california,
too,
which
we
think
is
the
important
case
in
this
area.
this
court
expressly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
right,
but
in
the
california
case,
in
california
ii,
the
court
adopted
the
convention
as
the...
as
providing
the
exclusive
methodology
for
determining
the
limits
of
inland
waters,
and
part
of
its
reason
for
adopting
that
methodology
was
its
conclusion
that
there
was
no
formal
basis
for
determining
baselines,
that
there...
in
fact
the
court
had...
the
court
in
1965
examined
the
same
materials
that
alaska
asks
you
to
examine
here,
and
concluded
that
none
of
it
amounted
to
a
formal
policy.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
under
the
convention,
under
the
terms
of
the
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
the
contiguous
zone,
the
united
states
has
the
option
of
employing
straight
baselines
where
it
sees
fit
along
its
coastline.
the
united
states
has
never
done
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
the
united
states
could.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
your
honor.
the
court
addressed
that
question
in
california
ii
and
said
that
the
rules
that
it
provided
in
the
convention
would
provide
the
governing
rules.
if,
at
some
point,
before
there's
a
final
determination
by
this
court
that
we
had
decided
to
apply
straight
baselines,
that
might
very
well
affect
the
determination,
but
instead
the
court
has
focused--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
the
appropriate
way
to
look
at
this,
the
question
that
the...
the
way
the
court
approached
this
problem
in
california
ii
is
that
it
said
that
when
we
encounter
these
issues
we
will
apply
the
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
the
contiguous
zone.
the
united
states
has
not
applied
straight
baselines
in
that
context,
and
so
therefore
it's
appropriate
to
look
to
the
arcs-of-circles
method
for
determining
what
the
limits
of
inland
waters
might
be,
and
that's
what
we
are
suggesting
should
be
done
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
the
united
states
adopts
it
in
the
future,
i
think
the
problem
we
would
encounter
is
that
the
determination
of
inland
waters
should
be
based
on
the
time
that
the
state
became...
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union,
so
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
right,
the
convention
didn't...
the
court
has--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
court
determined
that
this
was
the
rule
that
it
wished
to
apply,
and
it
applied
the
convention
rules
consistently
in
all
of
the
tidelands
cases,
tidelands
cases
since
then,
so
we've
had
the
convention
as
being
the
applicable
rule
in
the
louisiana
case,
the
united
states
v.
maine
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
was
signed
in
1958,
it
was
ratified
in
'61,
and
it
went
into
force
in
19--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
the
court
in
fact
applied
it
to
california
and
to
louisiana.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that
is
right,
but
i
can't
see
any
reason
why
we
wouldn't...
we'd
want
to
provide
a
special
rule
for
the
state
of
alaska.
part
of
the
value
of
the
convention--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
became
a
state
after--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
convention
was
signed,
but
before
it
was
ratified
and
went
into
effect.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
so
the
united
states
to
that
extent
had
reflected
by
its
signature
on
the
treaty
its
intention
to
adopt
those
convention
policies
at
the
time
of
alaska's
statehood.
i
think
for
that
reason
there's
no
serious
problem
with
applying
it
to
the
state
of
alaska
and,
what's
more,
we
would
want
to
have
uniform
rules
with
regard
to
all
of
the
states.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
depart
from
those
rules
in
the
case
of
one
particular--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
united
states,
in
order
to
adopt
straight
baselines,
would
have
to
indicate
its
intention
on
nautical
charts
that
are
duly
publicized
to
foreign
countries,
and
the
united
states
has
not
done
that.
it
has
no
intention
of
doing
that,
and
so
for
that
reason
that
simply,
the
straight
baselines
issue
is
not
relevant.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
it
would
be
a
decision
by
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
of
alaska,
or
the
united
states?
if
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--with
respect
to
alaska
we
would
say
no,
it
isn't.
it
doesn't.
it's
too
late
for
alaska.
for
the
united
states,
the
united
states
may
still
have
the
option
in
the
international
community
for
adopting
a
different
rule,
but
that's
a
separate
matter
from
what
we
have
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
in
fact
i
think
that
this
is...
this
case...
the
question
that
has
been
posed
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
had
a
historic
policy
of
applying
a
straight
baseline
instead
of
using
a
10-mile
rule,
and
in
fact
that's
the
issue
that
i
would
like
to
address
here,
because
i
think
we
do
need
some
clarification
on
a
few
points
with
regard
to
that.
we
think
that
the
historic
bay
provisions
of
the
convention
provide
an
adequate
opportunity
for
alaska
to
raise
claims
that
there
has
been
a
contraction
of
recognized
territory
by
the
united
states,
but
even
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
that
point,
we
think
the
master
is
quite
correct
in
his
historical
analysis.
what
he
concluded
after
a
careful
review
of
the
history
is
that
the
united
states
never
had
a
policy
of
enclosing
lands
behind
islands
under
a
10-mile
rule.
as
he
explained,
there
was
a
concession
in
the
1903
alaska
arbitration
saying
that
we
did
not
object
to
it
in
the
specific
context
of
that
case.
there
was
no
mention
of
that
policy
again,
and
in
1930
the
united
states
provided
formal
comments
on
the...
to
the
hague
conference
on
the
territorial
sea,
or
on
the
law
of
the
sea,
and
in
that
case
the
united
states
did
not
use
a
10-mile
rule.
instead,
it
used
an
inconsistent
methodology,
namely
a
rule
of
assimilation,
so
the
united
states
had
no
such
policy
in
1930,
the
one
time
in
which
it
made
a
formal
statement
to
the
international
community.
the
special
master
went
on
and
catalogued
the
history
from
1930
past
alaska's
statehood,
and
indicates
quite
convincingly
that
there
never
was
a
formal
policy
of
any
kind.
there
were
various
statements
that
may
have
been
made
at
one
time
or
another
that
suggested
the
10-mile...
a
10-mile
rule
might
be
applicable
under
particular
circumstances
such
as,
for
example,
the
case
of
straits
leading
to
an
inland
sea,
but
there
was
no
formalized
policy
and,
in
fact,
alaska's
own
expert,
professor
charney,
agreed
with
that
result.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
in
fact
what
we
find
is
the
statement
that
was
made
in
the
california
ii
case,
where
the
court,
in
adopting
the
convention--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
but
i
think
that
in
fact
it
had
examined
this
issue
more
carefully.
in
the
case...
and
the
statement
made
in
the
alabama
case,
you
must
remember,
was
tied
to
particular
facts
that
were
involved
there.
as
the
court
indicated,
this
was
a
bay
that
involved
certain
cul-de-sacs,
and
so
it
could
arguably
fit
within
the
geography
of
straits
leading
to
an
inland
sea,
but
it
does
not
establish
a
rule
for
fringing
islands,
and
what
the
court
said
i
think
in
california
ii
is
really
quite
pertinent.
before
today's
decision...
i'm
reading
from
page
24
of
our
brief,
which
quotes
the
opinion.
before
today's
decision,
no
one
could
say
with
assurance
where
lay
the
line
of
inland
waters
as
contemplated
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
hence,
there
could
have
been
no
tenable
reliance
on
any
particular
line.
after
today,
that
situation
will
have
changed.
the
very
reason
that
the
court
adopted
the
convention
in
1965
was
to
provide
certainty
and
assurance,
and
to
rule
otherwise
in
this
case
would
simply
upset
what
has
been
the
controlling
rule
in
all
of
the
cases
the
court
has
decided
in
its
original
jurisdiction
respecting
the
tidelands,
and
that
is
precisely
why
we
think
the
court
should
adhere
to
california
ii
and
apply
the
convention
strictly,
and
even
if
it
goes
beyond
that,
it
will
find
that
there
is
not
a
factual
basis
to
support
the
application
of
a
10-mile
rule.
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
next
issue,
a
second
exception
that
alaska
raises,
which
is
alaska's
challenge
to
the
special
master's
determination
that
dinkum
sands
is
not
an
island.
the
master
concluded
that
dinkum
sands
is
not
an
island
under
article
10
of
the
convention
because,
in
the
master's
words,
dinkum
sands
is
frequently
below
mean
high
tide.
contrary
to
the
contentions
that
alaska
makes
in
its
brief,
the
master
was
correct
in
concluding
that
article
10
requires
that
an
island
must,
at
a
minimum,
be
normally
or
usually
above
mean
high
tide.
his
interpretation
is
a
sensible
reading
of
the
text,
which
defines
an
island
as
a
naturally
formed
area
of
land
surrounded
by
water
which
is
above
water
at
high
tide.
if
article
10
were
read
to
impose
no
temporal
requirements,
then
every
sandbar
that
might
occasionally
peek
above
the
water's
surface
could
conceivably
become
an
island.
the
drafting
history
of
article
10
indicates
that
the
drafters
did
not
intend
that
construction.
the
initial
drafts
required
permanence.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i'd
be
happy
to
do
that,
if
you'd
like,
and
let
me
just
make--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
alaska
before
this
court
has
compared
dinkum
sands
to
what
are
known
as
mississippi
mudlumps
in
the
mississippi
delta.
those
are
formations
that
are
first
of
all
not
carefully
described
in
the
record
of
this
case.
they
received
rather
limited
attention.
you'll
find
a
discussion
of
them
in
the
special
master's
report
where
he
discussed...
discusses
the
question
of
horizontal
permanence,
namely
the
fact
that
dinkum
sands
seems
to
move
about
horizontally
as
well
as
up
and
down
vertically,
and
that
is
the
sole
discussion
we
have
of
the
mudlumps.
the
character
of
the
mudlumps
as
best
as
we
can
describe
it
from
the
court's
past
decisions
is,
these
mudlumps
appear,
and
they
persist
for
years,
and
gradually
erode
away,
so
they
do
not
have
the
character
that
we
find
here
with
dinkum
sands,
a
feature
that
comes
and
goes
within
a
matter
of
days
or
weeks
or
months,
so
we
don't
think
that
the
mudlumps
are
an
adequate
comparison.
in
any
event,
the
court's
discussions
of
the
mudlumps
have
not
indicated
conclusively
that
the
mudlumps
are
islands.
the
discussion
of
these
cases
has
typically
described
them
as
a
portico
to
the
mainland.
what
we
have,
we
think,
is
debris
that's
floating
down
the
mississippi
river
and
collecting,
remaining
for
a
while.
some
of
those
things
may
be
called
mudlumps.
there
are
also
features
that
actually
emerge
from
the
mud
themselves,
form
mounds,
but
then
disappear
as
well.
the
fact
is,
we
just
don't
have
a
good
record
in
this
case
on
mudlumps,
and
it
was
not
an
important
part
of
alaska's
case
on
the
merits.
alaska's
evidentiary
case
was
really
turned
on
the
fact
that
an
attempt
to
prove
permanence
with
respect
to
dinkum
sands,
and
as
the
master
explained,
the
dinkum
sands
formation
is
simply
not
permanent.
the
joint
monitoring
study
that
we
did
in
1981,
in
which
we
monitored
this
feature
for
one
full
year,
showed
that
it
was
below
mean
high
tide
throughout
that
year.
if
there
are
no
questions
about
dinkum
sands,
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
third
exception,
where
alaska
challenges
the
master's
contention
that
the
united
states
has
routine
title
to
coastal
submerged
lands
within
the
national
petroleum
reserve.
alaska
had
originally
conceded
in
this
litigation
that
the
united
states
had
retained
those
coastal
lands,
and
its
only
argument
was
exactly
where
to
draw
the
federal--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i...
you're
correct,
justice
o'connor,
that
it
does
not
determine
the
issue,
but
i
think
it
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--says
something
about
the
natural
reading
of
the
language
of
the
statutes
that
we
have
here.
it
was
not
until
1981
that
alaska
first
questioned
whether
these
submerged
lands
were
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this...
well,
setting
aside
alaska's
change
of
heart,
the
master
correctly
concluded
that
the
congress
had
authorized
the
president
to
reserve
the
npra
to
the
pickett
act,
which
empowered
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
we
would
certainly
say
that
that
is
the
case
under
section
11(b)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
the
intention
is
quite
clear
from
section
11(b),
because
it
refers
to
the
united
states
securing
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
a
tract
of
land
owned
by
the
united
states
and
known
as
the
naval
petroleum
reserve
number
4,
which
is
now
the
national
petroleum
reserve.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
this...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
statement
was
made
in
the
context
of
the
enclave
clause
of
the
constitution,
which
requires...
the
united
states
is
supposed
to
acquire
title
to
the
land
before
it
can
request
accessional
jurisdiction
from
the
state,
so
in
fact
in
the
case
where
the
united
states
does
attempt
to
exercise
legislative
jurisdiction
under
the
enclave
clause,
it
acquires
ownership
of
the
land
as
well
as
jurisdiction.
the
two
go
hand-in-hand
under
the
constitution.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
the
united
states
would
be
free
to
sell
property
over
which
it
owns
and
has
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that,
so
that
a
subsequent
conveyance
of
the
property
is
simply
consistent
with
the
complete
authority
the
united
states
would
have
over
the
particular
enclave,
but
i
think
what
we
see
here--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
in
the
enclaves
that
i
am
most
familiar
with,
i
think
it
does.
the
example
of
a
military
base
is
a
good
example,
where
the
united
states
wishes
to
exclude
any
state
involvement
in
the
land
of
the
military
base
whatsoever.
it
will
purchase
the
property
and
receive
the
state's
permission
to
exercise
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction,
so
that
it
has...
completely
ousts
the
state
of
any
authority
within
that
land,
and
i
think
that
that
is
what...
when
we
look
at--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
the
issue
is
slightly
different
from
that,
justice
breyer.
i
think
the
issue...
we...
the
way
the
special
master
read
it,
and
the
way
that
we
read
it,
is
that
ownership
goes
hand-in-hand
with
the
acquisition
of
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
that's
clear--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
have
to--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--leave
it
to
alaska
to
address
that.
i
simply
don't
know
what
their
position
is
on
that.
we
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
think
it
clearly
argues
that
point
quite
frankly,
your
honor.
i
could
be
mistaken
about
that,
and
i'm
willing
to
stand
corrected
by
alaska,
but
it
certainly
has
not
been
an
important
point
in
the
argument
that
we
have
here.
but
what
i
think
is
also
significant
is
that
section
11(b)
refers
to
the
tract
of
land
that
we're
talking
about
here
as
being
owned
by
the
united
states.
that
is
the
language
of
section
11(b)
that
says,
over
such
tracts
or
parcels
of
land
as
immediately
prior
to
the
admission
of
said
state
are
owned
by
the
united
states
and
held
for
military
naval,
air
force
or
coast
guard
purposes,
including
the
national
petroleum
reserve.
so
i
think
what
section
11(b)
is
a
quite
clear
ratification
of
the
judgment
of
the
president
the
united
states
owns
all
of
those
lands--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
i
think
first
that
this
does
satisfy
the
express
retention
requirements
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
we
identified
a
particular
tract,
the
united
states
did,
congress
did,
i
should
say,
and
that
tract
is
defined
by
said
boundary,
and
that
boundary--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
oh--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this
tract--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
this
tract
does
meet
the
utah
lake
test,
and
you
can
determine
that
from
the
special
master's
treatment
of
the
issue.
he
recognized
that
the
npra
encloses
both
territorial
sea--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
the
master
did
apply
utah
lake
according
to
its
clear
language.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i...
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
i
think
the
special
master's
interpretation
of
utah
lake
is
faithful
to
both
the
intention
and
the
content
of
the
opinion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if...
then
i
suppose
the
issue
becomes
more
difficult
here,
and
you
might
have
to
separate
out
the
two
different
areas
we
have
between
territorial
sea
and
inland
waters,
but
the
master
applied,
claimed
to
apply
the
utah
lake
test,
and
we
think
that
he
did
correctly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
so,
your
honor,
and
for
this
reason,
that
what
we're
applying
here
clearly
is
the
application
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
which
was
not
at
issue
in
utah
lake,
and
the
reason
why
the
court
came
up
with
its
presumptions
in
utah
lake
was
because
it
needed
a
rule
to
determine
congressional
intent.
that's
what
the
issue
is
here.
it's
ultimately,
what
did
congress
intend?
there
was
no
clear
rule
with
regard
to
the
1888
act
involving
utah
lake,
and
i
think
the
court
quite
rightly
expressed
some
concerns
in
that
case
about
the
expansive
result
of
that
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
i
think
that
the
concern
that
i
have
about
this
is
that
congress
has
dealt
with
the
problem
you
faced
in
utah
lake,
namely
has
provided
a
statute
that
deals
with
the
question
of
state
retention
of
submerged
lands
and
federal
retention
of
submerged
lands,
and
that
is
the
submerged
lands
act.
it
established
a
test,
which
is
the
expressly...
a
test
that
includes
several
exceptions,
including
the
expressly
retained
exception
that
we
rely
on
here.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
strange
rule
of
statutory
construction
to
say
that
what
congress
meant
when
it
used
that
statute
was
the
language
this
court
used
almost
20
years
later,
more
than
20
years
later
in
the
utah
lake
case.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
language--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
think
you
should
interpret
that
language,
and
apply
that
language
directly
based
on
what
its
plain
content
is.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
it
is
similar.
i
think
it
is
similar
in
the
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
maybe
it's
helpful
to
look
at
it
in
the
specific
context
of
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
my
answer
is
this,
that
we
think
that
the
submerged
lands
act
test,
expressly
retained,
does
embrace
the
situation
we
have
here
where
congress
addresses
a
tract
of
land
that
has
defined
boundaries
that
extend
out
and
include
submerged
lands.
we
think
that
that
does
qualify
as
an
expressed
retention.
i
think
justice
o'connor
indicated
she
had
some
doubts
whether
utah
lake
would
go
that
far.
the
master
thought
that
it
did,
and
we
think
so
as
well.
if
you
disagree
and
think
that
utah
lake
imposes
a
stricter
standard,
we
say
that
no,
the
submerged
lands
act
test
is
more
limited,
and
it's
limited
in
accordance
with
what
the
special
master
suggested
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
move
on,
in
the
time
that
i
have
remaining,
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
united
states
ownership
of
coastal
submerged
lands
within
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge.
this
is
the
exception
the
united
states
has
raised
in
this
case,
and
we
disagree
with
alaska
on
a
narrow
but
important
point
of
law.
we
explained
to
the
master
that
section
6(e)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act,
which
retains
in
federal
ownership
land
withdrawn
or
otherwise
set
apart
as
refuges
or
reservations--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--6(e)
of
the
statehood
act--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct.
it
is
found
at...
in
the
u.s.
exception
brief,
the
first
brief
we
filed.
in
the
appendix
it's
page
6a.
but
section
6(e)
of
the
statehood
act
retained
in
federal
ownership
lands
withdrawn
or
otherwise
set
apart
as
refuges
or
reservations
for
the
protection
of
wildlife,
and
we
believe
that
that
preserved
the
land
contained
within
the
arctic
wildlife
range,
including
the
submerged
lands.
we
noted
to
the
master
that
those
lands
fall
squarely
within
section
6(e),
because
the
united
states
had
set
them
apart
through
administrative
action
in
accordance
with
federal
regulations
and
then
in
force.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
was
the
bureau
of
sport
fisheries--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--which
is
a
division
of
the
fish
&
wildlife
service.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
under
the
regulations
that
were
in
effect
at
that
time,
43
c.f.r.
295.11(a),
a
state
and
a
state
agency,
the
heads
of
state
agencies
could
also
have
filed
an
application,
but
these
were...
these
applications
were
restricted
to
government
applications,
and
they
were
done
only
after
careful
study.
obviously,
the
typical
application
was
coming
from
the
federal
government.
states
rarely
were
filing
applications
to
request
the
united
states
to
set
aside
federal
lands
for
the
federal
government's
use.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would
have
had
to
have
been
the
head
of
a
state
agency,
and
i
think
that
simply
reflects
a...
an
element
of
deference
of
the
federal
government
to
the
judgments
of
the
states.
if
the
states
in
fact
felt
that
land
should
be
set
aside
for
a
particular
purpose,
the
united
states
would
withdraw
those
lands
for
a
study
and
retain
them
in
that
purpose
for...
you
know,
consistent
with
that
purpose.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that's
correct,
but
if
the
master,
or
if
the
secretary
turned
them
down
and
there
had
not
been
the
intervening
statehood
that
we
had
here,
the
lands
would
certainly
revert
to
their
former
state.
where
we
have,
however--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
based
on
the
judgment
that
congress
made
in
this
case,
congress
determined
that
the
lands
that
would
be
held
and
retained
by
the
united
states
would
be
lands
that
were
either
withdrawn
or
otherwise
set
apart,
so
it
clearly
meant
to
go
beyond--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--for
a
wildlife
refuge,
and
so
clearly
it
meant
to
go
beyond
land
that
had
been
formally
withdrawn,
and
we
think
it
meant
to
include
as
well
land
that
was
under
consideration.
now,
if--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
those
cases,
because
the
statehood
act
did
not
reach
the
question,
go
beyond
wildlife
refuges,
those
lands
would
not
have
remained
in
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
well,
we
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
that
congress
enacted
the
statehood
act
with
recognition
that
there
were
these
situations
such
as
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge,
and
that
the
secretary
acted
on
the
reasonable
reliance
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
he
knew
that
he
had
set
it
apart.
he
read
the
statehood
act
and
could
see
that
since
he
had
set
it
apart
it
would
be
retained
in
federal
ownership
for
his
ultimate
action.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
i
think
that
is
the
correct
way
to
read
these
provisions,
together,
that...
and
remember
that
section
6...
justice
kennedy,
remember
that
section
6(m)
contains
5(a),
which
is...
provides
for
express
retentions,
so
in
fact
6(a)
is
quite
consistent
with
the
submerged
lands
act
insofar
as...
6(e)
is
simply
an
example
of
an
express
retention.
it
was--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
still
think
that
we
should
in
this
case.
obviously
it
could
be
a
more
difficult
issue
in
that
case,
but
we
think
when
you
read
the
provisions
together,
it
makes
sense
to
read
6(e)
and
6(m)
in
the
way
that
i
have
suggested,
namely
that
this
is
an
express
retention
in
accordance
with
the
submerged
lands
act,
and
the
terms
of
the
express
retention
were
lands
that
were
withdrawn
or
otherwise
set
apart
as
a
wildlife
refuge,
and
then
finally,
the
last
part
of
our
argument
here
is
that
these
lands
were,
in
fact,
set
apart
as
a
wildlife
refuge,
and
so
therefore
they
qualify.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe...
my
answer
to
this
is
yes.
as
i
understand
your
question,
justice
souter,
you're
hypothesizing
a
case
where
the
united
states
has
withdrawn
its
own
federal
lands
after
statehood
and
then
decides--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--oh,
before--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
in
fact,
justice
souter,
that's
exactly
what
would
happen,
keeping
in
mind
that
oftentimes
we're
dealing
with
uplands
rather
than
submerged
lands.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there
would
be
no
question
of
title
transferring
at
all.
but
in
the
case
of
an
upland
withdrawal
that
the
united
states
owned,
statehood
has
no
effect
on
it
whatsoever,
and
we're
simply
suggesting
the
same
effect
should
result--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
the
government
can
change
its
mind.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
the
master's
reading
could
have
that
effect.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
a
serious
concern
for
us,
is
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
united
states
has
an
argument
that
these
lands
remain
in
federal
ownership
because
they're
a
part
of
another
land
withdrawal
called
plo
82.
however,
that
issue
is
also
in
litigation
as
well,
but
i
think
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
special
master
in
this
case,
it
does
raise
some
serious
questions
for
us
with
regard
to
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
the
united
states
has...
i
have
to
be
careful
about
this,
because
i'm
not
sure
what
alaska's
arguments
are
in
all
of
the
various
litigations
we
have
here.
i
believe
they
have
conceded
the
uplands
ownership
in
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge,
but
again
i
can't
be
sure
that
they
have--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--as
far
as
the
exceptions
that
were
filed
in
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
united
states
alone
accepted
the
anwr
in
a
timely
manner.
we
raised
only
this
question
of
6(e),
and
that's
the
only
issue
that
you
should
decide.
in
a
later-filed
brief,
alaska
has
raised
questions
with
regard
to
the
master's
determination
of
the
boundary
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--they
would
have
to
have
excepted--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
believe
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
our
view
here
is
that
6(e)...
we
have
not...
we
don't
agree
with
the
master's
determination
with
respect
to
inherent
authority.
in
other
words,
suppose
there
was
no
6(e)
at
all:
would
the
united
states
have
corporately
retained
these
lands
simply
through
the
action
of
its
officers?
we
did...
the
master
concluded
that
the
united
states
would
not,
did
not...
would
not
have
retained
those
lands,
and
questioned
whether
we
had
the
authority
to
do
so
in
that
context.
we
disagree
with
that,
but
we
have
not
raised
an
exception
to
it.
we
ask
this
court
to
resolve
this
issue
on
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
for
these
lands
to
be
set
apart
in
accordance
with
the
language
that
it
used
in
the
statute
and
in
accordance
with
the
regulation
that
was
then
in
effect
and
the
secretary's
actions
under--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
we're
not
relying
in
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--on
this
issue
on
a
midwest
oil
theory
by
itself,
although
we
raised
that
issue
in
the
lower
court
proceedings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that
there
was
at
least
one
that
i
know
of,
and
there
was
one
involving
the
aleutian
islands,
and
ultimately
the
secretary
decided
not
to
go
forward
with
that,
that
particular
application.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
right.
that
issue
has
never
been
litigated,
though.
that
is
an
issue
that
there
was
a
question,
i
believe,
that
arose
that
prompted
the
deputy
solicitor's
opinion
that
is...
that
some
reference
has
been
made
to
in
1959.
that
deputy
solicitor's
opinion
suggests
that
the
united
states
would
not
have
ownership
of
the
submerged
lands.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
it
did
not
consider
section
6(e)--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
can't
say
that
i
know
of
any
others.
i
can't
speak
with--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--assuredly
on
that,
though.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
what...
the
importance
of
our
construction
of
section
6(e)
here,
that
the
master...
the
secretary
quite
reasonably
relied
on
the
plain
language
of
section
6(e)
in
not
acting
on
the
application
while
it
was
pending.
i
think
that
he
reasonably
concluded
that
the
language
of
section
6(e)
allowed
him
to
set
apart
these
lands
and
to
defer
action
until
after
statehood,
and
in
fact
that's
what
he
ultimately
did,
and
it
would
be,
i
think,
most
troubling
to
find
that
his
actions...
that
his
confidence
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
was
misplaced.
but
even
if
you
had
doubts
about
the
clarity
of
the
language,
we
think
that
you
should
recall
and
apply
the
familiar
canon
that
grants
of
federal
lands
are
construed
in
favor
of
the
united
states,
and
nothing
passes
out
of
the
united
states'
hands
except
for--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
certainly
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
a
reflection
of
that
policy,
ultimately.
the
equal
footing
doctrine
had
its
origins
in
the
notion
that
the
united
states
should
not
be
conveying
land
under
the
general
land
laws
to
private
parties
in
a
way
that
would
harm
the
states'
ultimate
acquisition
of
the
lands.
the
notion
was,
the
united
states
retained
those
lands,
although
it
was
holding
it
in
trust
for
future
states.
now,
when
you
cross
the
low
water
line
into
the
territorial
sea,
and
much
of
the
area
in
anwr
is
territorial
sea,
that
same
principle
applies
with
even...
with
equal--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
i
think
it
does,
as...
i
think
that
as
i
was
discussing
with,
i
believe
it
was
justice
kennedy,
that
that
does
have
application.
our
view
is
that
we
have
satisfied
the
expressly
retained
language
by
section
6(e),
and
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
i
would
make
this
point
in
response,
and
that
is
the
submerged
lands
act
itself
is
a
grant
of
federal
lands,
and
for
that
reason
it
ought
to
be
construed
with
reference
to
the
federal
government's,
and
the
importance
of
protecting
the
federal
government's
interest,
so
in
reading
the
expressly
retained
language
of
the
submerged
lands
act--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
as
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
as
this
court
has
said
in
rodriguez
and
ltd,
other
cases,
that
no
statute
perceives
its
policy
or
its
general
purpose
at
all
costs,
that
the
very
essence
of
legislative
choice
is
the
process
of
making
exceptions
and
drawing
lines,
and
we
think
that
certain
lines
were
drawn
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
and
that
because
this
is
a
grant
of
federal
property
it
ought
to
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
federal
sovereign,
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--oh,
i
think
that
your--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--oh,
i
think
that
we
have
a
question
even
how
far
expressly
goes
in
this
context,
as
we
saw
with
regard
to
the
npra.
for
instance,
whether
it's
express
enough
that
we
described
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
npra
and
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
with
a
boundary
that
goes
to...
to
include
submerged
lands.
we
would
view
that
as
being
an
express
retention.
as
i
understand
some
of
the
justices,
they
have
some
questions
abut
this,
and
this
is
an
area
where
we
think
that
it's
appropriate
to
give
deference
to
congress.
remember
that
congress
ultimately--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--perhaps.
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
well,
that's...
we
have
no
problem
with
that,
and
the
question
simply
becomes
is
this
an
express
grant
where
we
in
fact
defined
the
boundaries
and
indicated
the
tract
that's
under
consideration.
i
think
we
do
have
to
remember
that
our
ultimate
goal,
our
ultimate
objective
here,
and
the
notion
and
concept
of
federalism
is
to
protect
congress'
interests
here
in
terms
of
its
determination
of
what
should
be
done
with
these
lands,
and
i
think
that's
something
we
ought
not
to
lose
sight
of,
that
if
you
err
in
favor
of
the
federal
government
retaining
acquisition
of
these
lands
and
you're
mistaken,
these
lands
can
always
be
conveyed
back
to
the
states
by
congress.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
err
on
the
side
of
the
state
and
the
lands
are
conveyed
to
the
state
against
the
wishes
of
congress,
that
is
something
that
cannot
be
remedied.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
suppose--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
united
states
has
been...
that
congress
has
been
quite
sympathetic
to
federal-state
concerns
with
regard
to
submerged
lands.
the
submerged
lands
act
itself
is
a
clear
indication
of
that.
but
i
think
that
we
can't
expect
the
state
to
have
the
same
solicitude
towards
the
federal
government's
interest
in
those
areas.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
oh,
i
think
congress
does
it
quite
routinely.
if
we
look
under
the
federal
land
policy
management
act
and
elsewhere,
i
mean,
that's...
congress
quite
routinely
engages
in
land
exchanges
and
turns
lands
over
to
the
states.
but
i
also
don't
want
to
lose
track
of
what
is
the
compelling
interest
that
we
have
here
with
regard
to
coastal
submerged
lands
involving
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge.
this
is
a
unique
and
remarkable
area,
that
justice
douglas,
who
visited
the
area,
described
as
the
last
american
wilderness.
we
think
that
congress
expressed
its
clear
intent
to
retain
national
control
of
those
lands
for...
in
the
national
interest,
and
that
it
should
retain
the
right
to
determine
how
they
are
going
to
be
utilized.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
that
is
a
very
important--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--oh,
i
think
it
would
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
the
reserve,
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
this
case
by
the
environmental
groups.
those
coastal
lagoons
are
used
by
a
migrating
herd
of
caribou
numbering
over
150,000
that
migrates
from
canada
to
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
and
back
every
year.
those
lagoons
are
also
central
to
the
interests
of
polar
bears
and
other
species.
