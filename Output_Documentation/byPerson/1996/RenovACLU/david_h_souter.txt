h.

mr.
waxman,
let
me
ask
you
another
question
more
or
less
along
the
lines,
i
guess,
of
justice
breyer's,
who
spoke
of
the
high
school
students
who
might
go
to
prison.
if
we
combine
the
display
section
and
the
knowingly
permit
section,
i
take
it
that
a
parent
who
allowed
his
computer,
the
computer
that
the
parent
owned,
to
be
used
by
his
child
in
viewing
offensive
material,
indecent
material,
the
parent
would
also
go
to
prison,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
an
offense
to
display
the
material,
as
i
understand
it
under
the
display
section,
where
minors
will
obtain
it,
and
if
a
parent
says
i'm
going
to
allow,
knowingly
allow
my
computer
to
be
used
by
my
child
to
observe
these
displays,
isn't
the
parent
therefore
guilty
of
the
knowing,
under
the
knowingly
permit
section?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
this
isn't
a
content
provider.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
person
who
knowingly
permits
a
device
under
his
control
to
be
used
in
effect
to
accomplish
or
facilitate
any
of
these
other
offenses,
and
one
of
the
offenses
is
the
display
offenses,
and
if
the
parent
says,
my
computer
can
be
used,
in
effect,
to
complete
this
display
offense,
because
i'm
going
to
let
my
child
view
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't
a
parent
guilty?
justice
david
h.
souter
how...
you
mean
under
the...
by
severance.
justice
david
h.
souter
under
severability?
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
agree
that
the
parent
would
be
guilty
under
that
section.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
could
i
construe
it
more
narrowly
than
my
hypothesis?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
have
in
mind?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
just
be
grabbing
a
limitation
out
of
thin
air.
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
could
view
this
but
justice
scalia
couldn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--at
this
point
it's
an
overbreadth...
i
suppose
it's
an
overbreadth
challenge
when
you
say
well,
it's
interfering...
not
as
a
matter
of
overbreadth.
it's
interfering
with
the
relationship
between
parent
and
child.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
would
i
have
to
do
that
in
order
to
save
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
ennis,
there
is
one
thing
i
don't
want
to
lose
before
you
go
away
from
the
prohibitively
expensive
point.
would
you
comment
on
mr.
waxman's
argument
that
those
who
transmit
and
display
could
do
so
subject
to
a
requirement
that
access
be
conditioned
on
an
adult
identification
number?
is
that
a
response
to
the
prohibitively
expensive
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
be
effective,
in
effect,
in
all
web
transmissions
and
display?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's'
not
true
under
the
display...
that's
not
true
under
the
display
provision
here,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
that
was
not
a
knowing
offense?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
display
provision
is
not
a
knowing
offense.
