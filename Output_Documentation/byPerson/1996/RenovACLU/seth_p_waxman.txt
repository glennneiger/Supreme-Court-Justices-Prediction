mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
internet
is
a
revolutionary
advance
in
information
technology.
it
also
provides
a
revolutionary
means
for
displaying
patently
offensive,
sexually
explicit
material
to
children
in
the
privacy
of
their
homes.
with
as
many
as
8,000
sexually
explicit
sites
on
the
world
wide
web
alone
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
and
the
number
estimated
to
double
every
9
months,
the
internet
threatens
to
render
irrelevant
all
prior
efforts
to
protect
children
from
indecent
material.
all
of
the
laws
regulating
the
display
of
indecent
materials
in
theaters
and
book
stores,
on
radio,
tv,
cable,
and
telephone,
all
of
these
approach
insignificance
when
the
internet
threatens
to
give
every
child
with
access
to
a
connected
computer
a
free
pass
into
the
equivalent
of
every
adult
bookstore
and
video
store
in
the
country.
congress
debated
for
a
year-and-a-half
before
enacting
the
communications
decency
act
which,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
contains
three
distinct
provisions.
let
me
go
right
to
the
broadest
one,
which
prohibits
the
display
of
patently
offensive
material
"in
a
manner
available
to
a
person
under
18
years
of
age.
"
when
read
together
with
the
statutory--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
(d)(1)(b).
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
when
read
together
with
the
statutory
defenses,
this
provision
permits
persons
to
post
indecent
material
on
the
internet
so
long
as
they
take
reasonably
effective
steps
not
to
expose
it
to
children.
the
district
court
found
that
on
the
world
wide
web,
where
most
of
the
material
that
concerned
congress
is
posted,
it
is
technologically
feasible
for
speakers
to
screen
for
age,
and
on
commercial
sites
that
is
commonly
done.
even
as
to
noncommercial
sites,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
technology
exists,
and
is
operating,
to
provide
adults
with
a
verification
code
that
allows
them
to
access
adult-only
sites
at
no
cost
to
those
who
post
information
on
those
sites.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
does--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
justice
o'connor,
the
mechanism
by
which
a
web
site
can
screen
for
age,
or
a
particular
page,
or
indecent
material
on
a
web
site
could
screen
for
age
is,
or
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
was
by
the
use
of
something
called
cgi
script.
but
the
obtaining
of
an
adult
id
is
something
that
the
unrebutted
evidence
showed
was
a
service
that
even
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
without
the
benefit
of
the
communications
decency
act
in
effect,
an
adult,
somebody
over
18
who
wanted
to
view
patently
offensive
material
on
a
screen
site
could,
for
$5
a
year,
obtain
an
adult
identification
that
would
give
that
person
access
to
any
and
all
adult
sites,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--exactly,
and
what
the
record...
what
the
district
court
found
as
fact
was
that
on
the
world
wide
web
it
is
technologically
feasible
and
economically
feasible,
either
by
use
of
a
credit
card,
which
is
more
expensive,
or
by
requiring
the
punching
in
of
an
adult
id
code
that
is
available
from
a
third
party
for
as
little
as
$5
a
year,
to
get
access,
but
the
technology
on
the
world
wide
web
exists
to
display
this.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
do
you
mean
use,
that
is
that
they
want
to
view
material,
or
use
that
they
want
to
post
indecent
material?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
right.
let--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--let
me
address
the
example
of
the
library.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
let
me--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
let
me
answer
your
second
question
first
and
then
go
to
your
library
example,
but
the
testimony
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
was
that
on...
for
certain
third
party
access
providers
like
america
online
and
compuserve,
which
allow
customers
to
create
their
own
web
sites
for
free,
they
do
not
currently
have
cgi
software,
so
for
example
i,
i
am
a
member
of
america
online.
if
i
want
to
create
my
own
web
page
i
have
to
go
to
somebody
else.
there
are
hundreds,
if
not
thousands
of
servers
that
you
can
go
to
to
create
a
web
page.
i
would
have
to
write
my
own
web
page
on
something
other
than
america
online,
or
of
course
america
online
could
simply
adopt
cgi
script,
which
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
at
least
it
had
chosen
not
to
do.
now,
as
to
the
library,
the
carnegie
library
is
an
appellee
in
this
case,
and
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
what
we
think
represents
the
overblown
nature
of
the
challenge
to
this
act.
the
library
wants
to
do
two
things.
it
wants
to
put
its
card
catalogue
on
line
so
that
anybody
anywhere
in
the
country
can
see
what
it
is
that
the
carnegie
library
has,
and
it
also
wants
to
put
on
line
journals
and
abstracts
that
it
in
turn
receives
on
line
in
an
electric
form.
now,
the
definition,
the
accepted
definition
of
what
is
patently
offensive,
that
is
a
term
of
art.
it
is
very
narrow,
and
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
see
how
it
would
apply
to
more
than
a
handful
of
cards
in
a
card
catalogue,
but
to
the
extent
that
it
does,
you
can
simply
run
it
through
some
sort
of
word
processor
or
computer
program
to
screen...
it's
only
text,
after
all,
on
cards,
and
if
you
find
a
card
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
correct,
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
finding,
as
we
read
it,
justice
ginsburg,
is
either
clearly
in
error
or
in
error
at
all.
what
the
court
found,
though,
was
that
for
noncommercial
web
sites...
that
is,
people
who
aren't
businesses
that
want
to
post
speech
on
the
world
wide
web...
it
would
be
prohibitively
expensive
to
create
their
own
adult
validation
system.
that
is
the
finding
that
the
court
made
on
page
55a
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
do
not
have
the
f.
2d
site,
but
that
was
not
the
only...
or
f.
supp.
site.
sorry.
that
was
not
the
only
other
alternative.
we
put
on...
in
response
to
their
claim
that
the
communications
decency
act
acts
as
a
ban,
we
put
on
evidence
showing
that
even
prior...
even
before
the
cba
came
into
effect
there
were
third
party
entities
that
on
line
would
provide
any
adult
with
an
adult
number
for
a
fee
of
between
$5
and
$9.95
a
year,
at
no
cost
to
the
person
who
wants
to
create
their
own
web
site
and
put
indecent
material
on
it,
which
would
allow
you
to
go
to
any
of
those
web
sites,
or
any
of
those
pages,
punch
in
your
number
and
get
access
to
it,
and
there
was...
that
evidence
is
unrebutted
on
the
record.
so
while
we
don't
challenge
the
court's
findings
that
if
people
like
you
or
i
wanted
to
post
our...
or
nonprofit
organizations
wanted
to
create
their
own
adult
verification
system
it
would
be
unduly
expensive,
we
do
challenge
the
adequacy
of
that
finding
to
support
the
conclusion
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
what
the...
justice
stevens,
what
the...
if
the
library
found
that
there
were
any
library
cards
that
contained
material
that
could
be
deemed
patently
offensive,
they
would
take
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
let's
assume
there's
that.
if
they
had
that,
what
they
would
do
is,
with
respect
to
those
cards,
or
those
journals
that
they
know
to
be
patently
offensive,
they
would
put
them
in
a
little
section
of
their
web
site
in
which
to
get
access
to
it.
if
you
want
to
see...
we
have
certain
other
cards--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
right.
it's
the
exact
analogy
to
what
may
very
well
happen
to
the
carnegie
library
itself
in
pittsburgh.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
pittsburgh
may
have
an
ordinance
that
requires
that
patently
offensive
material
be
kept--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
a
different
room
and
supervised.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
act
does
not
make
illegal
the
provision
to
adults
of
this
material.
if
a
father
or
mother--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if...
well,
i
think
here
it
depends
a
little
on
the
mode
of
communication.
if
i...
if
you
ask
me
to
send
you
an
indecent
e-mail,
and
you
tell
me
that
your
son
is
sitting
right
next
to
you
and
is
going
to
read
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--then
i...
then
under
the
specific
child
and
transmission
provisions
as
well
as
the
display
provision,
you
could
not
send
it,
but
there
is
nothing
to...
there
is
nothing
in
this
act
that
in
any
way
gets
in
the
way
of
adult-to-adult
communication.
i
may
very
well
find
that
my
16-year-old
son
in
my
judgment,
in
my
responsibilities
rearing
my
child,
should
be
able
to
see
material
that
a
jury
would
find
patently
offensive,
and
i
can
certainly
do
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
no.
no,
no.
absolutely
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
only
thing
that
is
prohibited
under...
if
i
can
separate
out
the
provisions,
under
the
two
more
specific
provisions,
what
we
call
the
transmission
and
specific
child
provision,
they
only
apply
to
transmissions
where
you
know
that
the
recipient,
or
a
recipient
is
a
child.
if
you
don't
know
that,
actually
know
it,
it
doesn't
apply.
now,
on
the
display
provision--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
knowing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
absolutely
right.
now,
the...
what
becomes
more
problematic
is
the
display
provision,
because
it
is
broader.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
are
actually
very,
very
important
to
us
in
terms
of
our
prosecutions
of
sexual
predators.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
this
is...
i
think
it's
(a)(1)(d),
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--transmission
provision,
and
(d)(1)(a),
the
specific
transmission,
the
specific
child
provision.
they
are
really
designed,
justice
o'connor,
to
get
at
the
determined
sexual
predator.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
high
school...
i
mean,
when
you
say
they
want
to
talk
about
their
sexual
experiences--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
shocked
to
learn
that
there
is
gambling
in
this
establishment.
[laughter]
there
is
a
big
difference,
justice
breyer,
between
discussing
sexual
experiences
and
communications
and
speech
that
is
patently
offensive
as
that
term
of
art
has
come
to
be
understood.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
may.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
high
school
students,
like
anybody
else,
communicates
what
a
jury
would
find
and
what
this
court
would
establish,
given
its
responsibility
to
create
a
constitutional
floor
to
be
patently
offensive
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
they
would
violate
it,
because
the
alternative--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
you
may
find
it
in
the
legislative
history,
but
it
is
not
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my
point,
if
i
could
just
finish,
justice
breyer,
there
is
something
that
is...
there
is
a
deadly
serious
point
here,
and
that
is
that
when
the
alternative
is
that
every
child
in
this
country
who
has
access
to
a
computer
and
can
click
a
mouse
has
access
in
his
or
her
own
bedroom
or
home
or
library
to
hustler
magazine
and
penthouse
magazine,
and
the
kind
of
indecent
speech
that
people
sitting
in
the
anonymity
of
their
own
bedrooms
anywhere
in
the
world
or
anywhere
in
the
country
wants
to
make
available
to
them,
we
think
that
this
is
a
small
price
to
pay,
and
congress
could
legitimately
say
that
this
is
a
narrowly
tailored
alternative.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
that
a
municipality
certainly
could.
i
think
it
is
a
harder
case,
but
i
think
a
municipality
could
make
it
a
crime
for
an...
for
two
adults
to
engage
in
patently
offensive,
sexually
explicit
communications
in
the
presence
of
a
minor
child.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
it's
a
harder--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
a
harder
case
because
a
public
park
is
a...
it's
a
free
space.
it's
an
area
where,
unlike
the
internet,
speech
is
free,
which--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
internet
is...
we
don't
think
it
is,
but
if
it
is,
in
any
event
it
certainly
is,
like
other
public
forums,
subject
to
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
we
don't
think
it's
a
public
forum,
whereas
a
park
would
be,
but
let
me...
if
i
can
just--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right,
and...
yes,
and
that
is
one--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
one
of
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
one
of
the
wonderful
things
about
it,
and
if
i
can
just
finish
answering
justice
kennedy's
question,
you
know,
if
a
theater
company
wanted
to
put
on
a
production
at
the
sylvan
theater
on
the
national
mall
that
contained
material
that
was
patently
offensive...
i
don't
know
what
a
current
production
would
be,
but
assume
that
they
did.
it
would
not
be
at
all
unreasonable
or
unlawful
for
the
park
service
to
say,
you
have
got
to
screen
for
age.
you
have
got
to
require
people
to
show
adult
id.
you
have
got
to
cover
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's...
i
think
the
analogy
here
really
is
to
renton
and
young.
this
is
really
a
zoning
issue.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
let's
assume
on
the
mall--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
i
mean,
what
congress
was
faced
with,
and
what
the
record
below
shows,
if
you
look
at
the
testimony
of
mr.
schmidt,
our
expert,
and
the
exhibit
that
he
produced
of
the
sites
that
he
visited
on
one
visit,
the
problem
is
very,
very
serious.
but
even
looking
to
the
national
mall
example,
justice
kennedy,
if
a
park
policeman
finds
somebody
sitting
on
one
of
the
benches
on
the
national
mall
making
a
speech
with
a
bull
horn
or
speaking
in
such
a
loud
voice
that
it
can
be
heard
by
others,
and
using
patently
offensive
language,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
constitutionally
impermissible
with
saying,
sir,
if
you
want
to
do
that,
there's
a
specific
place
on
the
mall
for
that,
or
for
$3
you
can
buy
a
cone
of
silence,
and
we'll
put
you
in
this
little
cone
and
you
can
talk
to
yourself.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
that's
what
this
is
about.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
those
laws,
justice
ginsburg,
are
distinguishable
in
two
very
fundamental
ways,
and
it's
critical,
i
think,
to
this
case.
one,
this
court
has
recognized
that,
as
opposed
to
minors,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
make
indecent,
patently
offensive
speech
to
adults,
and
insofar
as
this
was
trying
to
protect
women
from
hearing
such
speech,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
secondly,
the
notion--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
the
notion
in
those
laws...
this
is
my
second
point...
of
what
is
offensive
was
i
think
subject
to
a
very
serious
vagueness
challenge.
what
we
have
here
is
a
definition
of
patently
offensive
material
that
is
not
vague,
that
has
been
held
by
this
court
and
the
fcc
and
the
lower
courts
not
to
be
constitutionally
vague,
and
we
have
set
out
at
page
17
of
our
reply
brief
pretty
much
in
haec
verba
what
a
jury
would
have
to
be
instructed
in
determining
whether
something
was
patently
offensive
under
their
prevailing
community
standards.
and
added
onto
that
we
also
have
now,
in
light
of
miller,
and
jenkins,
and
hamling,
and
ferber,
this
court's
unequivocal
statement
that
in
the
area
of
patently
offensive,
where
first...
where
there
is
a
first
amendment
implication
on
where
the
floor
is
drawn,
the
court
will
and
must
draw
a
constitutional
floor
below
which
juries
and
legislatures
can't
go,
so
we
have
a
standard
here
that
has
been
accepted,
and
can
be
refined
by
this
or
other
courts.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
see
why
that
would...
maybe
i'm
missing
something--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
the
language,
but
it
prohibits
a
transmission.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
so.
this
is
a
statute
that
is
self-consciously
directed
solely
at
the
content
provider,
the
person
who
is
putting--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--information
on
the
world
wide
web.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
see
your
point.
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
you're
referring
here...
i
now
understand.
you're
referring
here
to
a
separate...
a
provision
separate
from
the
three
provisions
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
that
is,
(c)...
i
can't
remember.
in
any
event,
the
knowing
permission
provision.
it's
number--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
(d)(2).
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
we
think...
we
think
that
in
order
to...
if
necessary
to
save
the
constitutionality
of
that
provision,
this
court
certainly
could
exempt
the
provision
of
this
material
for
parents.
i
mean,
one
of
the
major--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
you
can
call
it
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
you
found
it
would
be
unconstitutional...
i
can
think
of
instances
in
which
it
might
actually
constitute
child
abuse,
which
this
court's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
it
depends
on
the
way
you
construe
it.
this
court
has
the
power
and
the
authority
in
dealing
with
a
statute
which
is
either
arguably
vague,
or
arguably
overbroad,
to
construe
it
or
to
partially
invalidate
provisions
or
applications
to
save
the
constitutionality.
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
could--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
could
certainly
construe
it
to
exclude
parents.
you
could
certainly
say--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
wouldn't
any
more
be
grabbing
it
out
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--let
me
just
say,
it
wouldn't,
because
there's
a
very
clear
record
before
congress
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
not
protecting
children
from
their
parents,
but
protecting
children
and
their
parents
from
the
children
getting
access
to
material
that
the
children--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
i
think
justice--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
could
and
would,
because--
i
didn't
say
will.
if
you
look
at
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
with
respect
to
overbreadth,
this
would
be,
i
suppose,
an
overbreadth
challenge
that
it
includes
parents,
or
doesn't
exclude
parents.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
this
court
would--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
and
you
could
do
exactly
what
you
did,
for
example,
in
united
states
v.
grace,
where
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution
for
demonstrating
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
supreme
court.
the
statute
defined
the
supreme
court
grounds
literally
by
metes
and
bounds.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
was
no
exclusion
for
sidewalks.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think...
because
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
it
is
so
clear
that
this
does
not
cover
what
a
parent
shows
a
child
in
the
absence
of
true
abuse,
which
is
separately
actionable.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
you
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
save
the
(d)(2)
provision
from
an
overbreadth
challenge,
you
should
construe
it,
you
must
construe
it
in
a
manner
that
saves
it
as
to
those
applications.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
sure.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it...
would
it
be
a
defense
to
the
prosecution
of
the
person
who
provided
the
content
on
the
internet?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--thank
you,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
district
court...
the
district
court
in
this
case
did
not
find,
and
properly
so,
that
the
purported...
that
this
purported
solution
that
the
appellees
have
offered,
these
parental
control
software
programs
like
surfwatch,
are
an
effective
alternative.
it
didn't
find
that,
and
the
reason
is
that
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
web
sites
and
tens
of
millions
of
pages
that
can
be
discretely
accessed,
and
with
the
number
of
sites
increasing
so
rapidly,
and
the
ability
to
change
the
name
of
the
site
so
easy,
there
is
simply
no
way
that
companies
like
surfwatch
or
parents
can
keep
up
with
what
can
and
can't
be
screened
out,
and
even
if
they
could,
with
computers
in
libraries
and
community
centers
and
schools,
it
is
not
an
effective
alternative
as
matters
currently
stand.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
the...
justice
scalia,
in
the
absence
of
a
regime
in
which
there
is
a
universal
tag...
that
is,
everybody
knows
and
everybody
uses,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay,
and
software
that
is
available
on
all
machines
that
are
sold
as
a
default
mode
to
screen
under
that
tag--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--congress...
that
would
essentially
be
the
mandated
v-chip
option.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
it
would
be
better
than
what
we
have
now,
but
it
would
not
be
either
more
effective
or
less
restrictive
than
the
communications
decency
act.
unlike
television,
we're
not
talking
about
a
handful
of
broadcasters
here
who
have
their
own
lawyers
and
their
own
advertisers
and
other
restraints
on
speech,
and
we're
also
not
talking...
we're
talking
about
millions
and
millions
and
millions
of
people
who
are
putting
speech
on,
and
that's
where
the
burden
has
to
be
put,
and
on
the
other
hand,
we're
also
not
talking
about
television
sets.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
difference...
the
regime
you've
hypothesized
is
one
in
which
all
telephone
calls
between
all
people
in
the
united
states
would
be
monitored.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
does.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
does.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
to
disagree
with
your
last
statement.
it
looks
a
little
bit...
it
looks
a
lot
different,
because
on
the
telephone
you
are
not
displaying
graphic
images.
you
are
not
talking
about
a
medium
which,
once
it's
placed
on
a
computer
by
anybody,
anywhere,
is
available
to
everybody
everywhere.
you're
talking
about
discrete
communications--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
it
would
be
hard...
if
i
can
just
finish,
it
would
be
much
harder
for
congress
to
demonstrate
and
i
don't
think
congress
believes
that
there's
a
compelling
interest,
because
of
those
differences,
in
doing
so.
you
know,
in
the
face
of
the
problem,
in
the
face
of
this
serious
problem,
i
need
to
focus
just
for
a
minute
on
what
the
district
court
did.
the
district
court
threw
up
its
hands
and
struck
down
a
statute
without
attempting
to
narrow
it,
without
attempting
to
make
it
more
specific,
and
most
significantly,
without
finding
that
any
more
narrowly
tailored,
constitutionally
acceptable
solution
exists.
that
is
error
of
law
of
the
first
order.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
all
i
can
say
is
that...
i
mean,
i
could
rattle
off
the
name
of
a
dozen
or
two
dozen
cases
in
which
this
court
in
either
the
overbreadth
context
of
the
vagueness
context
has
done
just
that
even
without
a
severability
clause,
and
when
there
is
a
severability
clause
that
includes
the
language
of
applications
as
well
as
provisions,
this
court
has
always
heeded
that.
in
fact,
in
wyoming
v.
oklahoma
where
the
request
was
that,
okay,
if
it's
invalid
as
to
one
particular
company,
just
strike
them
out,
what
this
court
said
was,
severability
clauses
may
easily
be
written
to
provide
that
if
application
of
a
statute
to
some
classes
is
found
unconstitutional,
severance
of
those
classes
permits
application
to
the
acceptable
classes.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
our
understanding
of
the
cardinal
rule,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
severability
clause,
is
the
rule
stated
in
ferber,
in
which
this
court
said,
when
a
federal
court
dealing
with
a
federal
statute
challenged
as
overbroad,
it
should,
of
course,
construe
the
statute
to
avoid
constitutional
problems
if
the
statute
is
subject
to
a
limiting
construction.
even
if
the
federal
statute
is
not
subject
to
a
narrowing
construction
and
is
impermissibly
overbroad,
it
nevertheless
should
be
stricken
down...
should
not
be
stricken
down
on
its
face.
if
it
is
severable
only
the
unconstitutional
portion
should
be
invalidated,
and
here,
where
we
have
a
severance
clause
that
directs
the
court
to
sever
as
to
unconstitutional
applications,
we
think
that
rule
should
apply,
too.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
five
points.
i
will
try
and
make
them
very
quickly.
the
burden
of
proof...
this
is
an
act
of
congress
that's
being
challenged
on
its
face...
the
burden
of
proof,
under
long
precedent,
is
with
the
party
challenging
it.
that's
verified
by
federal
rule
of
evidence
301,
and
this
court's
precedence
in
walters
and
hicks
v.
st.
mary's
honor
center.
with
respect
to
the
classification
burden
on
the
carnegie
library,
this
court's
precedence
in
the
obscenity
context
have
indicated
that
there
is
no
obligation
for
the
carnegie
library
to
read
every
one
of
its
books
in
order
to
decide
it
has
to
be
classified.
in
order
to
prove
a
criminal
case,
we
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
actually
knew
the
content.
so
the
carnegie
library
only
has
to
do
what
it
has
to
do
under
its
local
ordinance,
which
is
take
the
indecent
stuff
and
put
it
in
a
different
room.
this
is
the
electronic
equivalent
of
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
true
under
the
display
provision.
that
is,
if
they
find
that
they
have
certain--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
you
have
to
knowingly
display
it.
and
it,
in
the
context...
if
i
may
just
finish
this
point...
it,
in
the
context
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
patently
offensive
prong
of
the
obscenity
context,
has
said
that
whatever
the
standard
of
proof,
whatever
the
scienter
is,
you
may
not,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
convict
somebody
unless
you
prove
not
that
they
knew
that
it
was
pornographic,
but
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--thank
you.
