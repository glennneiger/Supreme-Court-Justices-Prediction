mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
four
reasons
why
the
preliminary
injunction
should
be
affirmed.
the
cda
bans
speech.
it
will
not
be
effective.
there
are
less-restrictive
alternatives
that
would
be
much
more
effective.
and
the
combination
of
an
imprecise
standard,
coupled
with
the
threat
of
severe
criminal
sanctions,
will
chill
much
speech
that
would
not
be
indecent.
first,
the
district
court
found
as
fact
that
the
cda
completely
bans
a
vast
amount
of
speech,
all
of
which
is
constitutionally
protected
for
adults,
from
all
of
the
unique
means
of
communication
in
cyberspace
except
the
world
wide
web,
and
effectively
bans
that
speech
from
most
of
the
web
as
well.
virtually
all
speech
that
is
displayed
on
the
internet
in
a
manner
that
would
be
available
to
adults
would
also
be
available
to
minors.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
let
me
try
to
answer
that
question
this
way.
there
are
40
million
speakers
who
use
news
groups,
listservs
and
chat
rooms.
it
is
not
technologically
possible
in
those
means
of
communication
to
screen
for
age.
the
government's
expert
conceded
that.
there
are
about
100,000
web
sites
in
all.
and
most
speakers
cannot
afford
the
$1,000
to
$10,000
it
costs
to
have
their
own
web
site.
furthermore,
there
is
a
much--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
southeastern
promotions,
in
schad,
in
bolger,
in
case
after
case,
the
court
has
held,
both
under
intermediate
scrutiny
and
under
strict
scrutiny...
particularly
under
strict
scrutiny...
that
the
possibility
of
a
functionally
equivalent
alternative
does
not
save
the
government.
here
the
alternative
is
not
functionally
equivalent.
let
me
say
why.
in
news
groups,
chat
rooms
and
listservs,
you
are
engaging
in
an
interactive
dialogue,
a
conversation,
in
which
you
speak
and
the
listeners
reply
and
you
can
reply
to
what
they
say.
they
can
be
outraged.
they
can
be
offended.
they
can
have
a
good
point
to
make.
a
web
site
is
static.
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
the
40
million
people
who
can
speak
in
an
interactive
dialogue
in
the
other
modes
of
communication
on
the
internet
should
post
a
static
message
on
their
web
site.
and
maybe
the
people
who
are
in
the
news
group
would
come
to
see
it,
maybe
not.
but
the
speaker
would
not
get
any
feedback.
there
would
be
no
dialogue.
second,
there
are
only
100,000
web
sites.
but
most
of
those
do
not
have
the
screening
capability
that
is
required
to
screen
for
age.
only
those
web
sites
that
have
what
is
called
cgi
script
capability
can
screen
for
age.
we
know
from
the
record
that
all
of
the
12
million
subscribers
to
the
internet
who
gain
access
through
america
online,
compuserve,
prodigy,
microsoft,
the
major
online
service
providers,
those
service
providers
provide
web
site
to
those
12
million
subscribers,
but
not
one
of
those
web
sites
can
have
the
capacity
to
screen
for
age.
so,
in
effect,
there
is
a
minuscule
portion
of
the
population
that...
for
which
it
is
technologically
possible
to
screen
for
age.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
because
the...
the
unique
ways
that
cyberspace
works,
you
have
to
be
able
to
have
a
computer
software
program
that
has
a
form
that
can
be
filled
in,
you
can
interrogate
the
listener
who
is
trying
to
have
access
to
your
speech,
and
then
you
can
have
other
data
processing
to
figure
out
whether
the
listener
can
have
access
or
not.
that
kind
of
software
does
not
work,
as
the
government's
expert
conceded,
on
news
groups,
listservs,
and
chat
rooms.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
scalia,
it
is
still
true.
the
government,
in
a
highly
unusual...
for
the
government...
has
cited
in
its
reply
brief
to
the
washington
post
and
newsweek,
to
suggest
that
it
is
possible
to
screen
news
groups
and
chat
rooms
on
web
sites
today.
the
fact
that
the
government
is
forced
to
refer
to
extra-record
material
shows
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
you
can.
and
in
fact,
the
government
is
wrong.
it
is
not
possible,
using
a
web
browser,
which
can
gain
access
to
a
news
group,
to
screen
for
age,
because
news
groups
exist
in
cyberspace
on
perhaps
200,000
different
news
group
servers.
and
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
separate
owners
and
operators
of
each
of
those
servers
to
screen
for
age.
otherwise,
the
speaker
would
not
be
protected.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
technologically
possible
on
some
web
sites
to
screen
for
age.
but
the...
the
district
court
also
found
as
a
fact
that
even
on
that
small
subset
of
web
sites,
the
cost
of
screening
would
be
economically
prohibitive
for
all
speakers.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
try
to--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
let...
let
me
try
to
explain,
chief
justice.
the
principal
way
to
screen
for
age
is
through
use
of
a
credit
card.
if
you
are
not
a
commercial
speaker,
most
credit
card
companies
will
not
verify
the
credit
card
at
all,
period,
for
any
cost.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
they
will
verify
if
you're
a
commercial
speaker.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
a
speaker
who
is
charging
for
access
to
his
or
her
speech.
and
that
is
a
very
small
subset
of
all
internet
speakers.
none
of
the
enormous
rauge
of
plaintiffs
in
this
case
is
a
commercial
speaker.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
questions...
two
points.
most
credit
card
companies
simply
will
not
verify
for
any
price
for
a
noncommercial
transaction.
they
are
not
set
up
to
do
that.
a
few
credit
card
companies
will,
but
the
record
evidence
showed
they
charge
a
dollar
per
verification
for
a
noncommercial
verification.
now,
if
you
are
a
speaker
who
wants
to
make
your
speech
available
to
100,000
listeners,
that
means
you,
the
speaker,
would
have
to
pay
$100,000
for
the
privilege
of
speaking.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
an
enormous
difference
between
some
burden,
some
cost...
which
this
court
has
upheld
in
other
contexts...
and
a
burden
or
cost
that
is
economically
prohibitive.
let
me
continue
to
answer
your
question
by
saying
that,
for
example,
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
carnegie
library,
which
has
been
used
as
an
example,
in
order
to
classify
which
of
its
speech
is
indecent
and
which
is
decent
within
the
meaning
of
this
law,
that
would
require
a
human
judgment
and
it
would
cost
about
$3
million
to
do
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
there
is
no
dispute
on
that
in
the
record.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
answer
that,
justice
scalia,
first,
by
saying
and
emphasizing
that
we
did
not
challenge
this
law
insofar
as
it
prohibits
obscene
speech,
child
pornography,
solicitation
of
minors,
harassment
of
minors.
that
kind
of
speech
was
not
challenged
and
is
not
enjoined
by
the
injunction
below.
we
are
only
talking
about
a
much
different
subset
of
speech
that
is
called
patently
offensive
or
indecent
speech.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
that
standard
is
broader
than
any
standard
this
court
has
ever
upheld
even
with
respect
to
sale
or
display
directly
to
a
minor,
and
is
vastly
broader
than
the
standards
applied
in
the
48
states
which
use
a
"harmful
to
minors"
standard,
which
requires
that
the
speech
be
not
only
patently
offensive
for
minors,
but
also
appeal
to
a
prurient
interest
for
minors
and
lack
serious
value
for
minors.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
souter,
mr.
waxman
said
there
was
unrebutted
evidence
below.
if
you'll
look
at
the
court's
opinion,
the
court...
what
the
court
said
was
the
government
presented
virtually
no
evidence
about
these
third-party
verification
bureaus.
but
what
the
evidence
does
show
is
those
third-party
systems
do
not
work
at
all
for
listservs,
news
groups,
chat
rooms,
all
of
the
modes
of
communication
in
cyberspace
except
the
world
wide
web.
so
those
third-party
bureaus
effectively
shut
down
the
40
million
speakers
who
use
those
other
means
of
communication.
they
cannot
be
used
in
those
other
means
of
communication.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
not
in
all
web
transmissions.
it
would
only
be
effective
in
web...
in
a
certain
number
of
web
transmissions.
but
i...
i
want
to
emphasize
that
one
of
the
real
democratizing
and
speech-enhancing
attributes
of
the
internet
is
that
average
citizens
can
speak
to
the
world
for
free.
in
order
to
own
your
own
web
site,
the
government
conceded,
it
would
cost
a
thousand
dollars
to
$10,000
to
set
up
your
own
web
site,
and
then
maintenance
costs.
so
we're...
we're
reducing
the
number
of
speakers
dramatically.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
breyer,
the
district
court
did
focus
on
that
question.
and
it
found
that
no
such
limiting
construction
was
possible
for
many
reasons.
first,
the
act,
by
its
terms,
applies
to
both
commercial
and
noncommercial
entities.
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
government
intended
to
regulate
both
commercial
and
noncommercial
entities.
it
applies,
by
its
terms,
to
the
speech
of
libraries
and
educational
institutions.
none
of
whom,
by
the
way,
are
regarded
as
pornographers
in
the
common
understanding
of
that
term.
it...
it
is
simply
not
possible
to
construe
the
statute
that
way.
and
if
you
did,
it
would
be
a
nonsensical
construction.
because
before
this
act
was
passed,
the
commercial
pornographers
already
charged
with
credit
card
for
access
to
their
speech.
they
don't
make
that
speech
available
for
free.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
again,
you
would
have
to
do
violence
to
the
text
of
the
act
and
to
the
legislative
history.
because
congress
squarely--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--on
the
text
of
the
act,
it's
not,
justice
o'connor.
but
the
conference
report,
at
page
188
and
189,
makes
very
clear
that
congress
expressly
rejected
the
more
narrow
"harmful
to
minors"
standard,
which
would
require
that
the
speech
be
not
only
patently
offensive,
but
also
appeal
to
prurience
and
lack
serious
value.
second,
the
conference
report
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
to
apply
the
act
under...
using
the
fcc
broadcast
standard
for
indecency
that
was
at
issue
in
the
pacifica
case.
as
the
fcc
said
in
pacifica
and
as
this
court
noted,
under
that
standard,
speech
can
be
found
indecent
even
if
it
is
not
prurient
and
even
if
it
has
serious
value.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that,
with
respect
to
the
vagueness
argument,
the
denver
area
case
is
dramatically
different
from
this
case.
first,
that
case
did
not
involve
any
criminal
sanction
whatsoever
and
did
not
even
involve
any
direct
prohibition
on
speakers.
it
simply...
the
only
provision
that
was
upheld
under
a
vagueness
challenge
simply
permitted
cable
operators,
who
have
their
own
first
amendment
rights,
permitted
them
to
exercise
their
own
editorial
judgment.
and
it
even
required
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--it
was,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
it--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--let
me
answer
it
this
way.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
term
was
actually
construed
in
any
particularly
limited
way
in
denver
area.
i
think
the
court
didn't
need
to.
but--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
the
court
did
refer
to
pacifica,
justice
ginsburg.
pacifica
also,
itself,
stressed
that
that
case
did
not
involve
any
criminal
sanctions
at
all.
an
administrative
slap
on
the
wrist
was
what
was
at
issue.
and
the
court,
three
times,
said...
it
was
emphasizing
that
the
court
was
not
upholding
a
prohibition
of
even
broadcast
indecency
if
it
was
accompanied
by
a
criminal
prohibition.
that's
what
this
case
does.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
i'd
be
very
happy
to
turn
to
that.
the
court
below
found
as
a
fact,
at
pages
32a
to
42a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
that
there
is
a
broad
range
of
technologies
and
software
programs
that
enable
parents
either
completely
to
block
all
access
to
the
internet,
if
the
parents
are
really
concerned
or,
more
selectively,
to
screen
and
filter
access
to
the
internet
if
they
want
to
allow
their
children
to
have
access
to
certain
parts
of
the
internet
but
not
to
others.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
basic
ones
don't
cost
a
thing.
everyone...
all
of
the
12
million
americans
who
subscribe
to
the
internet
through
the
major
online
service
providers
get,
at
no
additional
cost,
the
parental
control
options
that
all
of
the
major
online
service
providers
offer.
using
those
options,
by
clicking
one
box,
you
can
completely
prevent
all
access
to
the
internet,
including
to
foreign
speech
on
the
internet,
which
this
law
will
not
deter.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
not
if
the
listener
uses
those
software
programs.
no
cost
at
all.
there
are
other
software
programs,
some
of
which
are
available
for
free
and
some
of
which
cost
perhaps
$30,
which
parents
can
use
to
filter
content
in
different
ways.
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
characterization.
if
you
look
at
page
42a
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
district
court
summarized
by
saying
that
these
were
effective,
and
there
was
reason
to
believe
they
would
soon
be
more
widely
available.
even
the
government,
if
you
look
at
pages
13
and
9
of
the
government's
reply
brief,
the
government
concedes,
at
page
13,
that
parents
today,
using
these
software
controls,
can
effectively
prevent
their
children
from
having
access
to
any
indecent
speech,
including
indecent
speech
posted
abroad.
the
government's
response
to
that,
however,
is
to
say,
well,
yes,
if
parents
want
to
be
really
safe
and
secure,
they
can
completely
protect
their
children;
but
that
might
deprive
the
children
of
access
to
some
parts
of
the
internet
they
should
have
access
to.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
not
a
first
amendment
problem.
that's
a
parental
judgment
issue.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
not--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--not
as
it
is
presently
worded,
justice
scalia.
because
the
way
it's
worded
now,
it
makes
it
a
crime
for
a
speaker
to
make
available
on
the
internet
speech
that
would
be...
to
display
speech
that
would
be
available
to
a
minor.
and
even
if
everybody
agreed
on
a
tagging
system
and
even
if
everyone's
computer
had
a
browser
that
was
set
to
read
the
tag,
the
speaker
would
have
no
assurance
that
those
browsers
were
set
in
that
way.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question,
justice
scalia.
because--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
that
was
an
issue
below.
the
government
conceded
the
government
had
the
burden
below.
that
was
an
issue
in
the
shea
case.
in
shea,
at
930
f.
supp.
923,
the
government
concedes
that
it
bears
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
display
provision--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
you'd
be
bound
by
the
government's
concession.
i
simply
want
to
suggest
that
the
government
has
made
that
concession
for
very
good
reason.
the
government
is
attempting
to
regulate
speech
that
is
constitutionally
protected
for
adults
and
some
of
which
is
constitutionally
protected
for
older
minors.
it
bears
the
burden
of
justifying
that
regulation.
the
government
conceded
below
and
in
the
shea
case
that
the
display
provision,
standing
alone,
is
an
unconstitutional
ban
on
speech.
and
it
said
that
provision
is
justified
because
of
its
argument
that
speakers
could
use
the
affirmative
defenses
to
communicate
indecent
messages
to
adults,
while
shielding
those
same
messages
from
minors.
but
the
district
court
below
found
as
fact
that
that
is
not
so.
it
is
not
technologically
possible
for
the
vast
majority
of
internet
speakers
to
use
those
affirmative
defenses.
therefore,
this
law
is
a
ban
on
indecent
speech
in
cyberspace.
returning
to
the
effectiveness
point
that
justice
ginsburg
asked,
it's
critical
to
note
here
that
the
court
below
found
as
fact
that
about
40
percent
or
more
of
all
speech
on
the
internet
is
posted
abroad
in
foreign
countries.
and
that
at
least
30
percent
of
all
indecent
speech
in
cyberspace
is
posted
abroad
in
foreign
countries.
the
government's
own
expert
acknowledged
below
that
the
cda
would
have
no
impact
on
that
foreign
indecent
speech,
and
that
parents
would
have
to
rely
on
parental
control
technologies
to
shield
their
children
from
that
foreign
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
first,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it's
more
like
50/50
today.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
here's
why.
it's...
suppose
we
were
talking
about
an
enormous
adult
bookstore.
everything
in
the
store
is
indecent.
and
the
government
says,
children
can
come
into
this
enormous
adult
bookstore
and
browse
unsupervised,
but
we're
going
to
remove
half
the
books,
half
the
videos.
that
would
not,
directly
and
materially,
advance
the
government's
interest
of
protecting
those
children
from
access
to
indecent
materials.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--if
they're
obscene,
they
can
eliminate
them
all,
justice
scalia.
we
don't
challenge
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
pornographic--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
the
way
the
internet
works,
a
child
using
a
search
engine
can
sit
down
at
their
typewriter
and
they
type
in,
if
they
want
to
go
somewhere...
and
it's
important
to
stress
that
in
cyberspace,
listeners
must
affirmatively
choose
where
they
want
to
go.
the
government's
expert
testified
that
the
odds
are
slim
that
a
child
would
come
across
a
sexually
explicit
site
by
accident.
but
if
a
child
wants
to
go
to
an
indecent
site,
the
child
sits
down
and
types
in
something
like
"triple-x
sex".
if
that
home
computer
is
not
using
parental
control
software,
that
search
engine
will
go
out
there
in
the
world
and
list
the
triple-x
sites
that
are
available.
all
the
triple-x
sites
that
are
foreign
will
be
listed
there.
the
kid
then
clicks
the
mouse,
and
they
have
access
to
all
the
indecent
speech
they
could
possibly
want
to
see.
the
government's
interest
here
was
not
limiting
children
to
50
four-letter
words
a
day
instead
of
100.
the
government's
interest
was
protecting
children
from
access
to
indecent
speech
at
all.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
and
this
act
would
be
completely
ineffective
in
achieving
that
goal.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
doesn't
specifically
address
that
question
at
all,
justice
kennedy.
which
is
a
big
problem.
because
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
below
that
if
this
law
were
upheld,
so
that
it
completely
suppressed
all
indecent
speech
by
all
domestic
speakers,
it
would
be
very
simple
for
commercial
purveyors
of
sexually
explicit
speech
to
move
all
of
their
operations
abroad.
and
they
don't
even
have
to
do
that.
using
a
dedicated
computer
here,
they
can
post
the
messages
here.
it
goes
to
a
foreign
computer,
an
anonymous
re-mailer,
and
that
speech
then
comes
back
to
this
country.
it
seems,
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
it
comes
from
a
foreign
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it's
not
applicable,
your
honor,
because,
first
of
all,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
government
would
not
have
personal
jurisdiction
over
foreign
speakers,
and
could
not
realistically
expect--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
there
may
be
one
or
two
or
10
or
20
applications--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
there
are
also
legal
reasons,
your
honor.
this
court
has
indicated...
and
justice
scalia's
opinion
for
the...
that
there
are
two
canons
of
statutory
construction
that
are
relevant
here.
the
first
is...
the
first
canon
is
that
you
do
not
presume
that
a
domestic
law
is
intended
to
have
extraterritorial
effect.
second,
even
if
it
is,
you
do
not
presume
that
it
does
apply
extraterritorially
if
that
would
create
a
conflict
with
the
laws
of
foreign
countries.
and
the
government's
own
expert
testified
in
this
case
that
there
are
many
foreign
countries
in
which
the
law
that's
considered
criminally
indecent
here
would
be
perfectly
lawful.
so
there
would
be
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
it
wouldn't
cure
the
second
problem,
your
honor,
because
that
would
then
be
a
conflict
with
the
laws
of
those
many
foreign
countries--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
congress
could
violate
that
standard
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i...
i
agree
that
congress
could
have
drafted
a
much
different
statute
than
the
one
it
drafted.
it
could
have
drafted
a
statute
that
did
not
apply
at
all
to
noncommercial
speakers.
it
did
not.
it
could
have
drafted
a
statute
that
only
applied
to
visual
images,
not
just
four-letter
words.
it
could
have
drafted
a
statute
that
was,
in
many
respects,
narrower
than
the
statute
at
issue
here.
it
could
have
limited
it
to
prurient
speech
that
lacked
serious
value.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
would
take
care
of
that
defect.
but
that's
not
the
statute
we
have
before
us.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
scalia,
this
is
not
that
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it's
not...
it's
not
the
only
argument.
it's
not
the
only
argument
at
all.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
it's
not
the
only
argument
at
all,
justice
scalia.
our
argument--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
would
be
ineffective
for
that
reason.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
even
if...
excuse
me,
justice--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--not
that
i
know
of,
justice
ginsburg.
there
may
be.
but
there
are
other
nations
that
have
attempted
to
regulate
the
content
of
speech
in
cyberspace.
china
attempts
to
regulate
speech
that's
critical
of
the
chinese
government.
it's
not
inconceivable
that
iran
might
attempt
to
regulate
speech
that's
critical
of
religious--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think...
in
fact,
the
chamber...
u.s.
chamber
of
commerce
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
criticizing
this
law
for
precisely
that
reason...
that
this
law
sends
precisely
the
wrong
signal.
that
it
is
appropriate
for
governments,
in
their
own
interest,
to
ban
whatever
speech
they
want
to
ban
from
a
global
medium,
which
will
cripple
the
competitiveness
of
u.s.
business
in
competing
in
this
increasingly
important
business--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
don't
think
obscenity--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
don't
think
obscenity
is
considered
appropriate
or
lawful
speech
in
any
country
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
that's
not
our
strongest
argument.
our
strongest
argument,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
this
law
will
have
the
unconstitutional
effect
of
banning
indecent
speech
from
adults
in
all
of
cyberspace.
for
40
years,
this
court
has
repeatedly
and
unanimously
ruled
that
government
cannot
constitutionally
reduce
the
adult
population
to
reading
and
viewing
only
what
is
appropriate
for
children.
that
is
what
this
law
does.
in
sable,
this
court,
in
the
telephone
context,
struck
down
a
law
that
had
precisely
that
effect.
it
banned
telephone
indecent
speech.
and
that
had
the
unlawful
effect
of
banning
that
speech
from
adults,
as
well
as
from
minors.
this
court
unanimously
struck
that
down.
and
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question
about
telephone,
i
do
not
believe
it
is
a
crime
in
this
country
today
for
private
persons,
including
private
teenagers,
to
communicate
indecent
speech
by
telephone.
it
would
be
a
crime
to
communicate
exactly
the
same
speech
under
the
cda.
so,
returning,
the
principal
arguments
we
have
is
that
this
is
a
ban
on
adult
speech.
it
is
not
going
to
be
effective,
for
the
reasons
i've
expressed,
about
all
of
the
foreign
indecent
speech.
and
even
if
it
were
effective,
there
are
less-restrictive
alternatives
that
enable
parents,
completely,
to
decide
what
they
think
is
appropriate
for
their
17-year-old,
as
opposed
to
their
16-year-old.
under
this
law,
there
is
no
parental
choice.
the
government
decides
what's
appropriate
for
all
17-year-olds.
a
parent
who
disagrees
with
the
government
cannot,
through
the
internet,
gain
access
to
speech,
safer
sex
information,
very
similar
to
the
information
at
issue
in
the
bolger
case.
that
parent
would
have
no
opportunity,
using
the
internet,
to
make
that
speech
available
to
the
parent's
17-year-old
child.
and
even
worse
than
the
hypothetical
you
asked,
justice
souter,
about
the
2
years
in
jail,
for
a
parent
to
send
an
indecent
e-mail
message
to
the
parent's
17-year-old
college
freshman
son
or
daughter.
that's
a
direct
transmission,
not
just
a
permitting
the
use.
the
parent
would...
would
be
committing
a
criminal
act
to
do
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
raise
significant
compelled
speech
questions,
justice
stevens.
whether
it
be
constitutional
or
not,
i
don't
know.
but
even
if
that
were
required,
that
would
not--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
less-restrictive
alternative
under
the
way
this
law
is
worded.
because
this
law
makes
it
a
crime
to
make
speech
available.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think...
i
think
what
would
be
constitutional
is
what
this
court
found
would
be
constitutional
in
denver
area.
and
that
is
encouraging,
facilitating
parents
to
use
the
parental
control
options
that
are
readily
available
to
them
right
now.
if
parents
use
the
software
tools
they
have,
they
can
block
or
screen
all
indecent
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
you
could--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
no--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that's
wrong,
justice
scalia.
right
now...
i'm
a
parent.
i
subscribe
to
one
of
the
major
online
service
providers.
i
clicked
the
kid's
only
box.
and
that
means
my
child
does
not
have
any
access
to
the
internet
unless
i'm
there
to
supervise.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
we
do
not
dispute
that
the
government
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
some
children
from
some
forms
of
speech
that
could
be
found
indecent.
but
the
problem
with
this
law
is,
in
order
to
achieve
that
objective,
it
completely
bans
all
of
that
speech
from
adults
and
also
bans
it
from
the
substantial
portion
of
minors
who
themselves
have
first
amendment
rights,
under
bolger
and
erznoznik,
to
have
access
to
the
banned
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
the
point,
justice
scalia.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
the
point.
the
parental
control
devices
that
are
available
on
the
internet
are
more
effective
than
any
control
devices
available
for
broadcast
tv,
cable
or
telephone,
because
the
parents
don't
have
to
be
there.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
