justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
may
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
the
first
point
that
you
were
answering,
because
i'm
puzzled.
i
thought
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact...
and
this
is
at
929
f.
supp.
846
to847...
found
as
a
fact
that
noncommercialorganizations
particularly
would
find
age
verification
prohibitivelyexpensive
and
that
indeed,
in
the
shea
case,
that
same
fact-findingwas
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
you
know,
there
was
once
prevalent
throughout
this
country
a
kind
of
ordinance
that
went
like
this.
it
made
it
a
misdemeanor
to
use
offensive
language
in
the
presence
of
women
and
children.
i
was
wondering
while
you
were
speaking
whether
you
were
saying
the
assumption
that
those
laws
are
no
longer
tenable
would
flunk
the
first
amendment,
that
that's
not
a
correct
assumption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
out
women.
just
children.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
(d)(2),
and
according
to
the
three-judge
district
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--plaintiffs
also
challenged
those
provisions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
the
district
court
was
concerned
about
legislating.
you
know,
it
would
be
one
thing
if
you
could
just
say,
take
out
this
sentence,
or
take
out
this
section,
but
just
the
kind
of
thing
you
describe
with
respect
to
the
parent,
that's
a
lot.
that
kind
of
tinkering
courts
don't
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
my
impression
from
califano
v.
westcott,
which
i
think
is
the
last
time
the
court
dealt
with
that,
and
it
dealt
with
it
up
front,
that
the
point
was
made
that
you
can
lop
of
something,
you
can
include
or
exclude,
you
can
put
a
caret
mark,
but
nothing
fancier
than
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
court
adhered
to
pacifica
in...
in
defining
indecency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ennis,
you
did
say
in...
in
your
opening
that
you
were
going
to
tell
us
about
a
less
restrictive,
more
effective
means.
and
i
was
intrigued
by
that,
and
i
hope,
before
your
time
is
up,
you
will
be
able
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
making
the
point
that
it
would
be
ineffective
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
did
bring
up
an
interesting
point.
are
there
other
nations
that
have
regulated
indecent
speech
in
cyberspace?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
might
want
to
control
the
world
with
respect
to
that,
to
rule
the
world
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
speech
that
that
nation
doesn't
like?
