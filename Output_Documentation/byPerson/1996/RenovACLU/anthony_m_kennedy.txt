justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
take
it
then
that
you
would
also
defend
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
which,
tracking
the
words
we
have
here,
prohibited
indecent
conversations
on
a
public
street
with
minors
present--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
between
minors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that
a
harder
case?
it
seems
to
me
easier.
it's
easier
to
verify.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
presence
of
that
minor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
the
internet
is
not
a
public
forum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
in
the
commercial
context,
and
justice
breyer's
question
and
my
following
question
pertained
to
people
that
don't
have
counsel,
that
aren't
broadcasters
or
regular
net
users
which
understand
what
the
concepts
of
decency
or
indecency
are
in
any
institutional
sense,
and
conversations
between
two
minors,
between
a
minor
and
an
adult,
between
two
adults
on
public
streets
and
public
places
would
all
be
prohibited,
it
seems
to
me,
under
your
analysis
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
not
clear
that
it
doesn't
cover
the
coffee
shop
owner
who
has
a
computer
network,
or
a
teacher,
or
a
high
school
librarian
who
under
her
supervision,
or
his
supervision
allows
this
material
to
be
accessed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
this
statute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
this
statute,
with
respect
to
foreign
speech,
prohibit
united
states
users
to
post
information
that
goes
abroad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
do
think
it's
a
weak
argument
to
say
that
the
united
states,
if
it
has
a
strong
public
policy,
cannot
lead
the
way,
and
maybe
other
nations
would
follow.
i
think
your
argument
is...
is
not
your
strongest
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
government
have
any
interest
in
protecting
children
who
do
not
have
parents
available
in
the
home
or
do
not
have
adequate
parental
supervision?
