of
course,
the
problem
is
not
at
that
end.
it
is
at
the
other
end.
how
can
a
person
putting
material
out
in
the
system
assure
that
it's
only
going
to
be
accessible
by
somebody
with
that
code?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
any
adult
has
a
heckler's
veto
on
the
whole
operation
by
simply
saying
i'm
going
to
let
my
child
watch
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
more
than
knowing
it,
isn't
it?
you
have
to
send
it
to
a
specific
person
under
18.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
to
me
if
you're
sending
it
to
the
adult
and
he
says,
by
the
way,
i'm
going
to
have
a
child
watching,
you're
not
sending
it
to
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
sending
it
to
the
adult.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
high
school
student
exemption?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
suggest...
before...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
that
justice
kennedy
poses
is
a
more
difficult
case,
but
isn't
the
reason
that...
i
don't
think
people
throughout
the
country
are
worried
about
their
kids
hanging
around
conversations
going
on
on
the
public
street.
isn't
the
scope
of
the
risk
involved
very
much
related
to
what
the
government
can
do
by
way
of
avoiding
that
risk?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
tagging,
mr.
waxman?
why
wouldn't
it
be
adequate
to
meet
the
problem
that
is
concerned
about
for
congress
to
say,
you'll
have
a
complete
defense
so
long
as
you
tag
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we'll
establish
a
system.
xxx
means
that
it
contains
the
kind
of
material
that
would
violate
this
act,
and
therefore
so
long
as
you
put
xxx
on
it,
you'll
be
safe.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
could
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
would
be
pretty
easy
if
they
were
tagged.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say
it
banned
it
from
other
applications
but
not
from
the
web.
is
it
your
contention...
and
there
is
much
of
this
in
the
briefs...
that
every...
every
facet
of...
of
cyberspace
must
be
open
to
this
kind
of
communication?
i
mean
what
is
wrong
with
saying,
well,
if
you
want
to
use
cyberspace,
you
have
to
use
the
web?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
get
into...
into
some
of
the
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but,
look.
let's
take
printed
communications.
it
is
certainly
lawful...
and
we
have
upheld
provisions
that
require
pornographic
materials
to
be
kept
away
from
minors
and
not
to
be
sold
in
such
a
fashion
that
minors
can
obtain
them.
this
effectively
excludes
the
publishers
of
pornographic
publications
from
vending
their
material
on
the
streets
in
vending
machines,
where
minors
can
get
access
to
them.
do
we
say
it's
unconstitutional
because
they
cannot
use
that
manner
of
communication?
i
don't
think
so.
we
say
tough
luck,
you
have
to
sell
it
in
stores.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
still
true?
how
long
ago
were
all
of
these
technological
conclusions
arrived
at?
there
are
some
aspects
of
cyberspace
that
didn't
even
exist
when...
when
the
hearing
was
held;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ennis--
--well,
i
suppose
it
depends
on
how...
i
mean
on
whether...
what
is
prohibitively
certainly
depends
to
some
extent
upon
the
goal
to
be
achieved.
i
mean
we
do
stop
individual
citizens
from
running
radio
stations,
because
of
all
the
regulations,
say
it's
prohibitively
expensive,
you
can't
run
your
own
radio
station.
and
we
say,
well,
you
know,
that's
tough
luck.
the
goal
to
be
achieved
is
everybody
can't
talk
at
once,
so
we
have
to
limit
the
numbers
and
we
have
to
have
all
of
these
technological
requirements.
it's
going
to
cost
you
$3
million,
and
we
say
that's
too
bad.
now,
how
valuable,
how
important
is
the
goal
to
be
achieved
here?
is
it
equivalently
important?
isn't
that
very
much
a
policy
judgment
that
congress
is
able
to
arrive
at?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ennis--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
ennis,
so
much
of
your
argument
is
based
upon
what
is
currently
available.
you
know,
i
throw
away
my
computer
every
5
years.
i
think
most
people
do.
this
is
an
area
where
change
is
enormously
rapid.
is
it
possible
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
today,
or
was
unconstitutional
2
years
ago
when
it
was
examined
on
the
basis
of
a
record
done
about
2
years
ago,
but
will
be
constitutional
next
week?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
next
year
or
in
two
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
depends
on
the...
on
the
security
of
the
safe
harbor.
and
how
secure
the
safe
harbor
is
depends
so
much
upon
technology,
i
frankly
think
that
this
case
depends
upon
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
i
have
no
way
of
understanding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
going
to
be
what.
now,
who
has
it?
this
is
a
distinctive
kind
of
first
amendment
statute.
i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
adjudicated
one
like
this,
which...
which
only
prohibits
speech
which
is
prohibitable.
there's
no
doubt
that
you
can
prevent
people
from
saying
these
things
to
minors.
and
that's
all
that
is
prohibited.
the
argument
is
not,
as
it
was
in.
pacifica,
you've
not
only
prohibited
communications
to
minors,
you've
prohibited
communications
to
adults
during
those
viewing
hours.
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
only
thing
prohibited
is
clearly
constitutionally
prohibitable.
and
your
argument
is,
ah,
but
in
prohibiting
what
is
prohibitable,
you've
done
it
in
such
a
fashion
that
you...
you
needlessly,
unnecessarily,
effectively
prohibit
non-prohibitable
speech...
that
is,
speech
to
adults.
that's...
that's
a
new
case
for
us.
and
i
wonder
whether
it
isn't
true
that
you
have
the
burden
of
proof.
so
long
as
the
statute
only
says
we're
prohibiting
these
communications
to
minors,
it's
your
burden
to
show
that,
in
doing
so,
you're
going
to
affect
adults.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
500
bookstores,
500
obscene
bookstores,
and
the
government
eliminates
250
of
them;
would
that
be
no
progress
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
obscene...
pornographic--
justice
antonin
scalia
--succeeds
in
excluding
children
from
250
out
of
500,
that's
no
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure.
while
i
certainly
agree
that
normally
statutes
are
not
interpreted
to
be
extraterritorial,
i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
had
a
case
in
which
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
difference
between
the
constitutionality
and
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
is
whether
it
is
extraterritorial.
i
think
if
the
only
way
to
make
it
constitutional
is
to
interpret
it
as
being
extraterritorial,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
wouldn't
say,
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean
if
that's
your
only
argument,
i'm
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
it's
a
pretty
weak
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
we
better
let
obscenity
in,
too,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
the
point.
if
that's
a
global
principle--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
--if
we
shouldn't
ban
stuff
that
we
don't
like,
it
would
apply
to
obscenity.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
readily
available
without
labelling.
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
without
tagging.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ennis,
if
i
had
to
be
present
whenever
my
16-year-old
is
on
the
internet,
i
would
know
less
about
this
case
than
i
know
today.
[laughter]
that
is
simply
not
a
realistic
possibility...
to
tell
every
parent,
if
you're
worried
about
it,
just
don't
let
your
teenager
use
the
internet
unless
you're
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
reasonable.
