mr.
waxman,
does
that
technology
require
use
of
something
called
cgi--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
order
to
screen
it
out,
in
effect?
is
that
the
mechanism
by
which
that
can
be
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
does
that
fit
in
with
use
of
web
sites
by
noncommercial
users,
or
just
private
individuals
or
libraries,
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
both.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
the
library
wants
to
have
material
on
its
web
site
which
might
be
viewed
as
indecent,
i
guess.
we're
not
talking
about
obscene
material--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--are
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
talking
about
some
other
category
of
material.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
while
you're
at
it,
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how...
what
percentage
of
web
sites
are
incapable
of
using
this
cgi
script,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
all
of
them
can
use
it,
and
so
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
those
two
other
provisions,
as
you
interpret
knowing,
are
virtually
worthless
as
i
understand
it.
i
mean,
they're
not
going
to
accomplish
much.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
a
pretty
public
place,
though,
because
anyone
with
a
computer
can
get
on
line--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
convey
information
and
images,
so
it
is
much
like--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--a
street
corner
or
a
park,
in
a
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
we
talk
about
the
defense
clauses
for
a
moment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
the
government
accept
that
it
is
a
defense
under
the
act
if
a
parent
or
any
owner
or
user
of
a
computer
buys
some
of
this
software
that
is
designed
to
screen
out
indecent
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
i
mean,
i
would
be
charged
presumably
under
the
display
provision
as...
for
putting
on
some
kind
of
indecent
speech
under
your
theory.
now,
is
it
a
defense
that
there
are
these
programs
and
software
to
prevent
the
use
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
about
the
parent
who
lets
the
child
use
the
machine--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
buys
the
software
to
screen
it
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
narrowing
the
definition
of
what's
patently
offensive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
act
just
isn't
specific.
it
says
"indecent
speech".
i
don't
know
that
it's
all
that
clear
from
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
ennis,
the
government
says
that
these
programs
aren't
effective.
and
that's
pretty
much
what
the
district
court
concluded,
too.
