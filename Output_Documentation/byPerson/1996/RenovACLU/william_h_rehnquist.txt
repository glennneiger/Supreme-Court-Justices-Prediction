chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-511,
janet
reno
v.
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
waxman
and
mr.
ennis,
i
would
like
to
tell
both
of
you
before
you
start
your
argument
that
each
counsel
will
be
allowed
35
minutes
instead
of
the
usual
30
in
this
case.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
(d)(1)(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(d)(1)(b).
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
two
provisions
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
transmission--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
public
forum
is
something
created
by
the
government,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
ennis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
are
the
others
incapable
of
screening
for
age?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
could
be
done,
then.
it
could
be
done.
you're
just
saying
it
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
some
of
these
things.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
it
mean
when
they
say
"prohibitively
expensive"
or
"economically
prohibitive"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
value-laden
adverbs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
you're
a
commercial
speaker,
they
will?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
what
do
you
mean
by
a
"commercial
speaker"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
credit
card
people
will
verify
for
the
commercial
speaker
because
he
can
pay
for
it
or
because--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
other
words,
they
would
verify
for
anyone
who
could
pay
for
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
first
radio
people,
you
know,
before
the
federal
radio
act
in
1927?
i'm
sure
that
imposed
a
lot
of
operating
requirements
on
radio
stations.
and
before
that,
they
could
just
say,
well,
we
like
it
the
way
it
is.
the
government
shouldn't
have
to
tell
us
we've
got
to
have
all
this
equipment.
but,
nonetheless,
the
government
did
tell
them,
and
that's
certainly
been
upheld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
prohibitively
expensive
for
the
carnegie
library?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
we
construed
the
term
"patently
offensive"
in
our
denver
area
opinions
last
term.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
might
say
that
the...
what
the
court
came
up
with
in
denver
maybe
was
too
lenient
for
a
criminal
statute,
but
certainly
the
term
was
construed
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
construed
in
a
quite
limited
way,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
construed,
do
you
think,
in
a
limited
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
cost
money,
though,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
there
will
be
no
cost
involved
in
any
part
of
this
alternative
to
the
parents?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
decide
cases
here
on
the
basis
of
concessions,
mr.
ennis.
i
mean,
that's
an
independent
judgment
that
we
make.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
70
percent
is
shielded
and
30
percent
isn't,
what
kind
of
an
argument
is
that
against
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
whatever
the
situation
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
certainly...
it
would
certainly
go
halfway.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
congress
could
cure
this
constitutional
defect
as
you
see
it
simply
by
making
it
clear
that
the
law
applied
everywhere?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
the
congress
said
we
don't
care
if
there's
a
conflict?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
congress
expressly
provides
something,
it's
not
violating
a
standard
of
statutory
interpretation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i'm
talking
about
broader
statute.
a
broader
statute,
in
that
respect,
saying
that
it
was
all
over
the
world
that
it
applied,
would
cure
this
one
constitutional
defect
that
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing
with
any
teeth
in
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
waxman,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've...
i
think
you've...
mr.
waxman,
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
96-511,
reno
versus
american
civil
liberty
union
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
