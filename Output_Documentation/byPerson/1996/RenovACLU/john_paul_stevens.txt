justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
just
for
a
little
more
clarification
about
your
specific
example
of
the
carnegie--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
library
posting
a
card
that
they
know
would
violate
the
statute
if
it
is
read
by
an...
17-year-old.
now,
what
does
this
software
do
exactly,
that
you
are
describing?
it
identifies
all
the
adult
people
who
have
access
to
adult
material.
that
means
that
anybody
who
does
not
have
that
cannot
see
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
assume
they
know
something
would
be,
so
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
everyone
who
does
not
have
the
adult
identification
equipment,
whatever
it
is,
those
people
just
don't
see
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
order
to
get
access
to
that
if
you're
a
viewer,
you
have
to
do
whatever's
necessary
to
become
an
identified
adult.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
an
identified--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
an
identified
adult
wrote
the
library
a
letter
and
said,
i
have
the
adult
stuff,
but
i
have
a
17-year-old
son
that
i'm
going
to
have
watch
this
with
me.
what
should
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
know
there's
a
17-year-old
the
audience.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
my
motive
is
that
i'm
anthony
comstock,
and
i
don't
want
this
stuff
to
go
out,
so
i'm
telling
you
i've
got
a
17-year-old
son
who's
going
to
help
me
police
the
airwaves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ennis,
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
to
require
all
transmitters
to
tag
their
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
not,
then
that's
not
a
less-restrictive
alternative?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
you
just
start
from
scratch,
with
a
law
that
requires
that
as
the
principal
means
of
screening.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
which
held
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional.
the
statute
is
the
communications
decency
act
of
1996
which
reported
to
preclude
indecent
and
sexually
offensive
material
off
of
the
internet
to
the
extent
that
they
would
be
available
to
minors.
while
we
do
not
question
in
the
slightest
the
legitimacy
and
importance
of
the
interest
in
protecting
minors
from
harmful
materials
of
this
kind,
after
a
rather
elaborate
study
of
this
extensive
piece
of
legislation,
we
have
concluded
that
both
of
the
challenged
provisions
are
unconstitutional.
we
explain
our
reasoning
in
an
opinion
that
occupies
some
40
pages
and
i
will
not
try
to
summarize
it.
i
will
merely
point
out
that
one
of
the
contentions
that
the
government
advanced
at
the
start
of
the
litigation,
they
suggested
that
the
legislation
was
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
the
growth
the
internet
because
so
many
people
might
hesitate
to
use
it
running
the
risk
of
encountering
this
kind
of
material.
now
we
find
that
argument
particularly
unpersuasive
because
the
phenomenal
growth
of
the
internet
seems
to
indicate
that
government
regulation
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
foster
rapid
growth
of
a
new
communications
medium
such
as
this
in
theoretical
experience
with
this
particular
medium
indicates
that
perhaps
a
lack
of
regulation
may
have
done
more
to
foster
growth
of
the
medium
than
the
regulation
itself
might
have.
as
with
respect
to
a
good
part
of
our
holding,
we
are
unanimous
on
the
judgment
although
justice
oâ€™connor
has
filed
an
opinion
joined
by
the
chief
justice
which
concurs
in
the
judgment
in
part
but
dissents
with
respect
to
one
aspect
of
the
statute.
