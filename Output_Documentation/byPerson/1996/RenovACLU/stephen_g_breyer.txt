justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
is
it
the
case
under
those
provisions
that...
suppose
a
group
of
high
school
students
decide
to
communicate
across
the
internet,
and
they
want
to
tell
each
other
about
their
sexual
experiences,
whether
those
are
real
or
imagined.
they're
all...
every
high
school
student
who
would
do
this
is
then
guilty
of
a
federal
crime,
and
subject
to
2
years
in
prison?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
been
known
to
happen
in
high
school.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
i
even
imagine
high
school
students
might
read
from,
let's
say,
books
or
magazines
that
have
what
people
might
think
of
as
patently
offensive
ways
of
describing
those
experiences.
if
you
get
seven
high
school
students
on
a
telephone
call,
i
bet
that
same
thing
happens
from
time
to
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
my
concern
is
whether,
analogizing
this
to
the
telephone,
it
would
suddenly
make
large
numbers
of
high
school
students
across
the
country
guilty
of
federal
crimes
as
they
try
to
communicate
to
each
other
either
singly
or
in
groups.
that's
one
concern
i
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
are...
might
be
talking
about
telephones,
which
was
the
point
of
my
example
with
the
children.
can
congress
suddenly
decide
that
all
private
telephone
conversations
will
be
monitored
to
see
if
there
is
indecent
material
going
across
the
telephone
that
children
will
knowingly
pick
up?
that
was
my
concern.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
answer
is
no,
then
how
does
this
differ,
because
the
internet
after
all
is,
in
addition
to
being
a
little
bit
like
a
common,
is
very
much
like
a
telephone?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
what
you'd
have
is
an
analogous
statute
that
applied
to
the
telephone
so
that
when
the
high
school
students
get
on
the
phone
and
talk
about
their
experiences,
suddenly
that
all
becomes
a
crime,
and
it
suddenly
looks
a
little
bit
worse
from
a
first
amendment
point
of
view--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
telephone.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
internet
is
rather
like
the
telephone.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
at
some
point...
mr.
ennis,
could
you
at
some
point,
at
your
choice,
address
the
question
of
severability?
in
particular,
i'm
thinking
is
it
possible
to
narrow
the
statute
perhaps
far
more
extremely
than
the
government
would
like,
but
to
commercial
pornographers?
is
there
a
way
of
reading
it
so
it
only
applies
to
people
who
make
significant
amounts
of
money
out
of
selling
pornography
across
the
internet?
is
there
some
such
construction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
just
out
of
curiosity,
is
it
not
applicable
to
messages
that
emanate
from
abroad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean
if
they
came
here.
suppose
they
came
here,
they
have
assets
here,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
totally
practically
or
is
there
some
legal
reason?
