justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
clarify
one
thing
at
the
outset,
mr.
minear?
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
that
the
statute
also
applies
to
federal
government
securities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
chicago
board
of
trade
has
filed
a
brief
in
which
they
express
concern
about
the
status
of
off-exchange
transactions
in
federal
securities.
and
as
i
understand
your
position,
they
would...
the
options
and
the
futures
transactions
would
be
treated
differently
in
that
security
as
well
as
foreign
exchange.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct,
but
they're
concerned
about
the
off-exchange
transactions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
position
is
that
the
trading
in
options
will...
would
be
regulated,
but
trading
in
futures
would
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
irony
then
is
you
would
retain
the
power
to
regulate
the
less...
i
mean,
the
market
that
may
not
exist,
namely,
the
options,
and
you
would
have
no
power
to
regulate
the
market
we
know
exists
in
futures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
could
exempt...
but
it
could
not
regulate
the
futures,
the
off-exchange
trading
in
futures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
the
unless
such
transactions
involve
at
the
end
of
the
subsection.
that
is
obviously
a
subcategory
of
those
which
are
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
if
involve
is
the
broader
term.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
help
me
out
with
the
term
repurchase
options?
what
is
the
universe
that
that
encompasses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
don't
know
what
repurchase
options
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
universe
that
repurchase
agreements
covers,
is
that
all
agricultural
commodities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
help
me
again.
a
repurchase
agreement
is
a
commitment
by
the
government
to
rebuy
a
previously
issued
security.
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
congress
has
authorized
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
to
regulate
so-called
off
exchange
trading
in
options
to
buy
or
sell
foreign
currency.
in
1974,
congress
enacted
a
series
of
amendments
to
the
commodity
exchange
act
that
created
the
commission
and
gave
it
authority
to
regulate
trading
in
a
number
of
non-agricultural
commodities.
one
of
those
amendments,
however,
provided
an
exemption
for
“transactions
in
foreign
currency”
unless
it
involved
sales
for
future
delivery
conducted
on
a
board
of
trade.
the
case
before
us
today
involves
transactions
and
options
to
buy
or
sell
foreign
currencies
that
were
not
conducted
over
a
board
of
trade.
the
narrow
question
of
law
that
we
decide
is
whether
such
transactions
are
species
of
exempt
transactions
in
foreign
currencies.
the
reasons
stated
in
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold,
that
they
are
included
within
the
exemption.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
judgment
is
unanimous.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
