mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
treasury
amendment
to
the
commodity
exchange
act,
which
is
quoted
in
full
on
page
1
of
our
brief,
provides
in
pertinent
part,
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
be
deemed
to
govern
or
in
any
way
be
applicable
to
transactions
in
foreign
currency
unless
such
transactions
involve
the
sale
thereof
for
future
delivery
conducted
on
a
board
of
trade.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
treasury
amendment
excludes
off-exchange
foreign
currency
options
from
cea
regulation,
thus
whether
off-exchange
foreign
currency
options
are
transactions
in
the
foreign
currency
within
the
treasury
amendment--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i
believe...
yes,
both
parties
would
agree,
your
honor.
the
only
dispute
is
because
it's
an
off-exchange
foreign
currency
option
transaction
rather
than
an
off-exchange--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--i
believe
they
should
be,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
both
of
them
are
exempt
by
the
treasury
amendment,
as
long
as
they're
off-exchange
transactions
in
foreign
currency,
whether
in
futures
or
in
options.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
no.
the
treasury
amendment
spoke
broadly,
your
honor,
of
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
it
did
not
limit
it
to
foreign
currency
futures.
it
spoke
broadly
of
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
and
accordingly,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
phrase
would
indicate
that
any
transaction
in
which
foreign
currency
is
the
subject
matter
would
be
excluded
by
the
treasury
amendment...
off-exchange.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i
would
think
the
holdings
your
honor
is
referring
to
are
certain
holdings
that
have
distinguished
off-exchange
futures
from
off-exchange
options,
along
the
lines
that
an
option
until
exercised
does
not
become
a
transaction
in
the
foreign
currency
itself.
and
if
those
are
the
decisions
to
which
your
honor
is
referring,
i
think
they
were...
first,
i
think
both
courts
that
decided
that
way
were
dicta
because
you
were
dealing
with
exchange
traded
futures,
although
that
was
not
the
ground
on
which
the
courts
went,
and
therefore
it
would
be
subject...
it
would
not
be
subject
to
the
act.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
in
the
two
cases
i
believe
justice
o'connor
is
referring
to...
is
the
chicago
board
of
trade
and
the
american
board
of
trade
case...
they
both
dealt
with
off-exchange
options
on
foreign
currencies,
and--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--thank
you.
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
as
i
said,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
holding
in
the
american
board
of
trade
case
on
which
the
court
below
relied
in
this
case
was
dicta
because
it
was
on-exchange
trading.
however--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--no.
i
agree,
your
honor.
i'm
not
questioning
the
way
the
court
got
there.
i'm
saying
they
could
have
gotten
there
another
way,
but
obviously
the
way
the
court
did
decide,
they
did
not
go
on
an
on-exchange/off-exchange--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--the
holding
in
american
board
of
trade
was
options
do
not
become
transactions
in
foreign
currency--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--until
they're
exercised.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
the
court
below
recognized
that
they
could
have
gone
on
a
different
basis--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--but
did
not,
and
accordingly
could
not
overrule
the
decision
of
the
prior
panel
and
noted
the
conflict
with
the
fourth
circuit
and
indicated
that
that...
such
a
conflict
was
for
this
court
to
resolve.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
oh,
i...
my
only
point,
your
honor,
was
i
said
i
thought
it
could
have
been
dicta,
but
clearly
that
is
not
the
way
the
court,
the
second
circuit,
went.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
the
question,
thus,
is
whether
the
off-exchange
foreign
currency
options
are
transactions
in
foreign
currency
within
the
treasury
amendment
and
thus
exempt
from
regulation
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
we
submit
that
that
question
should
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
for
two
reasons.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
phrase
transactions
in
foreign
currency
means
any
commercial
dealings
involving
foreign
currency
or
any
dealings
where
foreign
currency
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
transaction.
here
off-exchange
foreign
currency
options
that
were
traded
are
dealings
and
they
are...
and
they
do
have
foreign
currency
as
the
subject
matter.
accordingly,
under
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
treasury
amendment,
they
are
exempt
from
commodity
exchange
act
regulation
by
the
treasury
amendment.
the
second
reason
really
confirms
the
first.
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
treasury
amendment
was
to
exclude
off-exchange
foreign
currency
transactions
of
whatever
type
from
the
commodity
exchange
act.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
that's
true,
your
honor.
there
was
not
the
established
market
there
is
for
off-exchange
foreign
currency
markets
in
1974.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
the
majority...
the
off-exchange
interbank
market
is
primarily
composed
of
the
major
banks.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
and
in
fact
the
trading
in
this
case
was
done
in
such
banks.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i'm
only
unclear,
your
honor,
if
you're
asking
back
in
1974
or--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--they're
trading--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--they
are
trading
foreign
currency
options
now,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
believe
from
the
amici
briefs
that
were
submitted
by
the
banks
and
the
industry
associations,
it
indicates
the
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
that
are
trade
in
that
market
on
a--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--i
think
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
also
note
that
although
the
primary
perhaps
concern
with
the
treasury
amendment
related
to
the
large
banks,
that
was
not
the
only
concern.
the
treasury
department
noted
that
it
was
also
to
affect
the
traders
and
investors
that
were
dealing
in
this
off-exchange
market.
so,
i
will
not
deny
that
the
majority
of
the
traders
were
the
major
banks,
but
they
are
not
the
only
traders
who
are
dealing
in
this
market
either
then
or
now.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
again,
your
honor,
are
we
speaking
then
or
now?
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i
don't
know
what
traders
existed
back
in
'74
in
the
government
securities
market.
i
would
certainly
assume
that
the
major
banks
were
trading
there.
the
treasury
department
in
its
letter
spoke
generally
of
this
off-exchange
market
referring
to
banks,
referring
to
investors.
the
cftc
itself
has
indicated
there
are
other
participants,
abritrageurs,
import-export
companies,
et
cetera,
dealing
in
the
general
foreign
currency
market.
i
have
not
individually
focused
underneath
that
in
terms
of--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--all
right,
your
honor.
the
second
meaning
that
i...
or
the
second
reason
i
was
suggesting
the
question
should
be
answer
in
the
affirmative
was
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
this
to
exclude
the
entire
off-exchange
market
from
regulation
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
and
as
has
been
suggested
by
the...
some
of
the
questions
today,
that
unless
that
decision
is
reversed
and
foreign
currency
options
are
held
to
be
excluded
by
the
treasury
amendment,
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
it
would
be
defeated
and
the
vast
majority
of
foreign
currency
options
may
move
to
banks
and
institutions
without
the
united
states.
now,
to
provide
just
a
brief
description
of
petitioners'
activities
in
this
case,
petitioner
dunn
was
the
president
of
petitioner
delta
consultants
which
served
as
an
advisor
concerning
foreign
currency
transactions
to
various
investment
companies.
however,
the
foreign
currency
options
that
were
transacted
were
not
traded
with
investors
and
they
were
not
traded
on
a
board
of
trade.
instead,
the
transactions
were
entered
into
in
the
international
off-exchange
interbank
market
with
major
banks,
primarily
credit
lyonnais,
bank
julius
baer,
societe
generale,
and
chase,
and
are
different
from
the
foreign
currency
futures
contracts
that
are
traded
on
exchanges
and
which
the
cftc
does
regulate.
the
district
court
rejected
the
argument
that
the
treasury
amendment
provided
an
exclusion
for
these
off-exchange
foreign
currency
options
and
therefore
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
second
circuit
affirmed
but
did
not
independently
analyze
the
treasury
amendment
exclusion.
we
submit
the
decision
should
be
reversed.
petitioners
here
engaged
in
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
those
transactions
were
not
conducted
on
a
board
of
trade,
and
thus
the
treasury
amendment
excludes
cea
regulation
of
petitioners
off-exchange
foreign
currency
trading.
as
this
court
has
held,
where
the
terms
of
a
statute
are
not
defined
in
the
statute
or
have
no
common
law...
established
common
law
meaning,
they
must
be
given
their
ordinary
meaning.
and
here
the
ordinary
meaning
of
transactions
in
foreign
currency
are
any
dealings
where
foreign
currency
is
the
subject
matter.
really
then
we're
dealing
with
the
meaning
of
four
words
in
the
treasury
amendment,
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
the
cftc
concedes
these
are
transactions.
there
is
no
issue
that
foreign
currency
is
involved.
so,
the
dispute
comes
down
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
as
used
in
the
four-word
phrase
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
because
there
is
no
indication
of
any
congressional
purpose
to
indicate
such
a
distinction.
i
think
that
the
argument
being
made
by
respondents
is
that
congress
selected
the
word
in
to
draw
a
rather
critical
regulatory
distinction,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
that
that
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
do
so.
there
would
be
no
reason
why
if
that
in
fact
were
the
intent,
the
treasury
amendment
would
not
simply
have
been
drafted
as
transactions
in
foreign
currency
futures
as
opposed
to
leaving
the
broad
description
of
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
there
is
no
reason
why
i
would
wish
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
a
reason
in
light
of
the
legislative
intent
indicated
in
enacting
the
statute.
the
treasury
department
letter
which
was
submitted
as
the
commodity
exchange
act...
the
amendments
were
being
proposed
and
the
definition
of
commodity
was
being
substantially
expanded
beyond
the
traditional
agricultural
commodities,
the
treasury
department
was
concerned
that
that
language
might
include
foreign
currency
transactions
and
communicated
that
concern
to
congress.
most
of
the
specific
discussion
contained
in
the
treasury
department's
letter
referred
to
foreign
currency
futures.
however,
the
specific
language
which
the
treasury
department
proposed
and
which
congress
enacted
as
the
treasury
amendment
does
not
speak
of
foreign
currency
futures.
it
speaks
more
generally
and
more
broadly
of
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
so,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
take
that
approach
unless
the
intent
were
to
exclude
the
entire
field
of
off-exchange
foreign
currency
futures.
indeed,
the
respondents
point
out
that,
as
has
already
been
commented
on,
in
1974
there
was
not
an
established
market
for
off-exchange
foreign
currency
options.
thus,
it
really
doesn't
make
sense
to
suggest
that
without
such
a
market
congress
intentionally
chose
the
word
in
to
distinguish
futures
from
an
options
market
which
did
not
yet
exist
to
any
real
extent.
so,
accordingly,
i
think
the
ordinary
meaning
and
the
most
logical
meaning,
which
is
confirmed
by
the
congressional
purpose,
is
that
transactions
in
foreign
currency
was
a
broad
exclusion
to
this
new
expansion
of
the
definition
of
commodity
under
the
cea
and
accordingly
should
be
given
that
effect
by
this
court,
namely,
to
exclude
the
entire
field
of
off-exchange
foreign
currency
transactions,
whether
those
transactions
happen
to
be
in
the
nature
of
futures,
options,
or
any
other
type
of
transaction
that
there
may
be.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i
do
not
agree,
your
honor,
that
the
savings
clause
only
relates
to
futures.
i
think
the
savings
clause
exempts
from...
the
treasury
amendment
excludes
all
off-exchange
transactions
in
foreign
currency,
and
the
savings
clause
brings
back
those
in
the
language
of
the
statute
which
involve
the
sale
thereof
for
future
delivery
conducted
on
a
board
of
trade.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
description
of
sale
for
future
delivery
would
include
both
futures
and
options.
i
think
the
act
in
different
places
uses
phrases
such
as
a
contract
of
sale
for
future
delivery.
here
it's
a
broader
phrased
sale
thereof
for
future
delivery.
so--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--well,
i
think
you
deliver
under
an
option
as
much
as
you
deliver
under
a
future
because--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--oh,
that's
true,
but
my
point
is
first
that
most
futures
contracts
are
offset
rather
than
actual
delivery
being
made
under
them,
and
the
nature
of
the
transaction
is
both
futures
and
options
are
derivative
transactions.
they
are
not
transactions
actually
involving
the
underlying
commodity,
whatever
that
commodity
might
be.
it's
not--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--and
i
believe
that
is
true
for
both
options
and
futures.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
from
the
writer's
standpoint,
your
honor,
there's
an
obligation.
perhaps
from
the
buyer's
standpoint,
he
might
have
the
decision
to
make
as
to
whether
to
exercise
the
option,
but
from
the
standpoint
of
the
writer
of
the
option,
he's
obligated
to
make
whatever,
depending
on
whether
it's
a
put
or
call
option...
to
make
delivery
or
to
get
out
of
the
contract,
offset
the
contract
in
the
same
way
you
would
do
with
a
futures
contract.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
on
6c(f),
that's
exactly
the
purpose,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
that's
true.
i
don't
think
there's
a
dispute
that
the
cftc
has
general
jurisdiction
over
options.
however,
when
specifically
dealing
with
foreign
currency...
or
transactions
in
foreign
currency,
whether
those
transactions
are
options,
futures,
or
any
other
type
of
transaction
in
foreign
currency,
those,
provided
they
occur
off
exchange
are
exempt
from
the
commodity
exchange
act
pursuant
to
the
treasury
amendment.
there
are
other
provisions.
section
2(i)
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
also
gives
regulation
authority
to
the
cftc
over
options.
but
again,
those
are
options...
regulation
generally
resides
in
the
cftc
which
is
not
disputed.
however,
if
the
option
is
in
foreign
currency,
if
it
is
a
transaction
in
foreign
currency,
the
treasury
amendment
pulls
it
out,
exempts
it
from
the
commodity
exchange
act,
whether
it
be
under
section
6c(b),
section
2(i),
or
any
other
section.
the
treasury
amendment
would
exclude
them
from
regulation
under
the
act.
the
ordinary
meaning,
as
i've
stated,
of
transactions
in
foreign
currency
basically
is
any
transaction
where
the
subject
matter
involved
is
foreign
currency.
the
cftc--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--an
option
is
as
much
a
transaction
in
foreign
currency
as
a
future
is,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
brief
on
the
merits,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
well,
first,
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
with
that
kind
of
a
conclusion.
the
cftc
or
the
respondents
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
arguing
that
transactions
in
are
different
from
transactions
involving.
your
honor
is
now
suggesting
transactions
on.
the
meaning,
particularly
in
light
of
the
way
the
treasury
amendment
came
up,
was
clearly
to
exempt
the
field.
the
treasury
department
proposed
the
specific
language
and
congress
adopted
the
language.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
again
if
the
intent
were
only
to
exclude
futures,
it
would
have
been
easy
to
say
transactions
in
foreign
currency
futures.
the
language
selected
by
congress
as
proposed
by
the
treasury
department
which
wished
to
exclude
cftc
regulation
in
the
entire
off-exchange
foreign
currency
market
was
simply
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
the
fact
that
the
act
in
different
places
may
provide
regulations
for
options
generally
does
not
detract
from
the
exclusion
that
the
treasury
amendment
provided
for
those
transactions
in
foreign
currency
whether
they
happen
to
be
options
or
any
other
type
of
transaction
in
that
foreign
currency.
i
would
also
note
that,
and
getting
back
to
one
of
the
prior
points
in
terms
of
delivery
as
a
future
compared
to
an
option,
is
that
the
cftc
respondents
argue
that
options
only
create
a
right
rather
than
an
obligation
to
purchase
or
sell
the
commodity.
that
type
of
distinction
is
really
inaccurate
because
it
doesn't
properly
describe
a
future
itself.
under
the
act
there
have
been
determinations
that
futures...
instruments
can
be
futures
without
that
type
of
purchase
and
sale
obligation.
the
cftc...
if
purchase
and
sale
of
the
underlying
commodity
were
an
actual
requirement
of
being
a
futures
contract,
then
the
cftc
would
not
have
been
able
to
approve
a
number
of
exchanged-traded,
cash-settled
futures.
where
there
are
no...
where
they
can
be
no
delivery,
there
is
no
obligation
to
purchase
or
sell
the
underlying
commodity,
and
in
fact
some
of
these,
such
as
eurodollars...
the
underlying
commodity
doesn't
really
exist.
you
couldn't
deliver.
you
have
to
cash
settle.
so,
the
delivery
aspect
in
an
attempt
to
differentiate
futures
and
options
simply
does
not
work
because
that
is
not
an
accurate
description
of
commodity
futures
contracts
themselves.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
they
don't
exist
as
such.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
speaking
here,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
regulatory
gap
because
even
the
cftc's
complaint
describes
the
investments
that
were
entered
into
here
as
investment
strategies,
and
i
think
that
would
fall
within
the
definition
of
investment
contracts
for
sec
jurisdictional
purposes.
so,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
regulatory
gap.
i
think
there
is
no
jurisdiction
of
the
cftc
over
these
transactions,
but
it
is
not
to
suggest
that
there
is
not
jurisdiction
of
other
agencies,
most
appropriately
the
sec,
to
regulate
those
type
of
transactions.
as
i
said,
the
transactions
were
not
made
between
petitioners
and
the
individual
investors.
the
transactions
were
made
between...
with
the
major
banks.
the
investors
were
not
counter-parties
to
any
of
the
off-exchange
foreign
currency
options
that
were
transacted
here.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
first,
your
honor,
i'd
note
that
it
might
not
have
been
intended
that
way,
but
i
think
your
question
has
a
hypothetical
element
to
it
simply
because
the
cftc
and
the
treasury
department
most
certainly
do
not
agree
over
the
way
this
provision
is
read.
i
think
perhaps
the--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--they
don't
agree.
they
have
filed
amicus
briefs
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
salomon
forex.
they
filed
amicus
briefs
on
opposite
sides
of
the
issue,
and
that
was
4
years
ago.
in
fact,
in
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
which
was
jointly
submitted
by
the
cftc
and
the
treasury
department,
one
of
the
reasons
that
were
offered
why
this
court
should
not
grant
cert
was
that
there
might
be
a
chance
the
agencies
would
work
it
out
between
themselves.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
obviously--
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
--that's
right.
the
treasury
department,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
does
not
share
the
view
of
the
cftc.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
specifically
by...
or
specifically
enacted
as
they
proposed
it.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i
think
that
that's...
obviously,
it's
a
hypothetical
because
it
hasn't
happened,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
the
number
of
years
the
dispute
has
existed,
if
it
were
possible
to
reach
some
kind
of
agreement
without
a
direction
from
this
court,
i
think
it
would
have
happened
by
this
time.
mr.
gary
d.
stumpp
i
will
agree
with
that
observation.
[laughter]
if
i
may,
your
honor,
if
there's
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
this
time
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
remains
for
rebuttal.
