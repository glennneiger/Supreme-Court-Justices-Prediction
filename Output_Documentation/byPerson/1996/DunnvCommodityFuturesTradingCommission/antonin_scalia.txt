exchange
traded
futures
or
exchange
traded
options?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
some
reason
in
policy
why
you
would
want
to
distinguish
between
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
one
would
wish
to
distinguish
between
the
two
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whether
actually
delivered
or
not,
whether
they're
offset
instead
of
executed,
doesn't
alter
whether
they
are
a
sale
for
future
delivery.
when
the
sale
occurs,
it
is
a
sale
for
future
delivery.
justice
antonin
scalia
an
option
is
not
a
sale
at
all.
it's
an
option
to
make
a
purchase
and
a
commitment
to
make
a
future
sale
if
the
option
to
make
a
purchase
is
exercised.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
look
at,
let's
see,
section
6(c).
where
is
it?
it's
on
page
6a
of
the
government's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--brief
on
the
merits,
and
it's
item
2
on
page
6a
which
is
section
6c(d)(2).
the
commission
shall
issue
regulations
that
permit
grantors
and
futures
commission
merchants
to
offer
to
enter
into...
enter
into...
or
confirm
the
execution
of,
any
commodity
option
transaction
on
a
physical
commodity
subject
to
the
provisions
of.
elsewhere
the
act
speaks
of
an
option
transaction
on
a
commodity,
and
you're
saying
that
the
earlier
expression,
transaction
in,
includes
options.
doesn't
this
later
language
suggest
that
transaction
in
does
not
refer
to
options?
options
are
on
the
commodity,
not
in
the
commodity.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
thing
was
called
the
treasury
amendment,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
was
introduced
by
the
treasury
department.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
your
answer
that
if
treasury
were
that
confident,
they
would
never
have
introduced
the
treasury
amendment?
if
they
were
content
to
rely
upon
the
good
offices
of
the
communities...
commodity
futures
trading
commission,
they
wouldn't
have
introduced
the
amendment
at
all.
they
would
have
just
said
we'll
cut
our
deal
with
the
commission.
we
know
they're
reasonable
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
congress
was
also
concerned
that
the
treasury
department
ought
to
have
control
over
matters
that
involve
trading
in
foreign
currency
which
probably
affect
our
own
currency
as
well.
the
cftc
is
an
independent
regulatory
agency,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
do
what
it
wants
and
the
president
cannot
alter
its
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
congress
was
concerned
that
these
decisions
should
lie
with
the
president
of
the
united
states
through
the
treasury
department,
and
i
don't
see,
as
far
as
the
impact
of
that
upon
our
national
life
is
concerned,
how
options
are
any
different
from
futures.
you're
talking
about
fiddling
around
with
foreign
currency,
and
given
the
international
market
that
now
exists,
you're
talking
about
fiddling
around
with
our
currency.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
certainly
don't
think
that
just
the
use
of
the
word
in...
it
bears
the
meaning
you
want
to
give
it,
but
if
that
same
terminology
had
been
used
in
some
legislation,
i
can
just
envision
the
government
coming
up
here
and
saying...
let's
say,
an
sec
authorization
says
that
it
can
regulate
transactions
in
something,
and
you
would
say,
well,
it's
ridiculous
to
think
that
you
can
avoid
all
of
this
by
simply
dealing
in
options.
of
course,
options
are
transactions
in
that
kind
of
thing.
i
don't
think
congress
had
that
distinction
in
its
mind
when
it
drew
this
thing.
so,
we're
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
are
those
in
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
trusted
the
ftc
to
make
these
determinations,
they
wouldn't
have
needed
the
treasury
amendment.
they
would
have
said
that
the
cftc
has
exemption
authority.
we
will
rely
upon
their
good
offices,
unreversible
by
the
president
of
the
united
states,
to
exempt
those
things
that
need
exempting.
they
were
not
willing
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
monitors
futures
contracts
for
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
works
there.
why
can't
it
work
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
some
rule
that
everybody
has
to
be
regulated
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
begging
the
question.
i
mean,
you're
just
begging
the
very
question.
did
they
make
that
determination
just
for
futures
or
for
all
transactions
involving
foreign
currency?
you
point
out
that
they
do
use
the
term
involving
to
refer
to
options.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
also
use
the
term
on
to
refer
to
options.
so,
they're
obviously
not
using
any
consistent
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
use
in,
they
use
on,
they
use
involving.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
has
anybody...
who's
representing
the
president's
position
in
this
case?
i
assume
that's
treasury's
position
since
he
controls
treasury.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
if
we
should
disagree
with
you
and
hold
that
options
are
included
within
the
exemption,
do
you
think
the
language
at
the
end
of
that
treasury
amendment,
unless
such
transactions
involve
the
sale
thereof
for
future
delivery
conducted
on
a
board
of
trade...
do
you
think
that
that
is...
can
be
applied
to
options?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
be
in
big
trouble
if
we
disagree
with
you
then.
