if...
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
souter,
there
were
very
few
traders
other
than
the
large
banks
in
options
in
foreign
currency.
how
about
options
in
government
securities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
the
concerns
that
i
have
is
that
whatever
we
say
here
with
reference
to
foreign
securities...
options
in
foreign
currencies
is
going
to
apply
also
to
options
in
government
securities.
and
there's
a
suggestion
in
some
of
the
briefs
that
accepting
your
position
would
lead
to
a
substantial
regulatory
gap.
so,
just
during
the
course
of
your
remarks,
i
hope
you
could
address
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
were
describing
an
option
alone,
would
you
use
the
word
delivery?
you
don't
deliver
under
one
of
these
kinds
of
options.
you
don't
deliver
anything,
do
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
true
also,
or
is
it...
it's
something
i
picked
up
from
one
of
the
briefs...
that
as
the
traders
become
more
and
more
sophisticated,
it's
harder
to
tell
a
difference
in
a
futures
and
an
option,
and
you
can
even
have
an
option
on
a
future,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
isn't
it
very
difficult
sometimes
to
tell
which
of
the
two
it
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
minear,
don't
futures
and
options
involve
the
same
market
participants?
i'm
not
sure
the
sense
of
regulating
one
and
not
the
other.
and
if
you
regulate
the
options
market,
it
seems
to
me,
particularly
if
they're
the
same
participants
and
it's
the
same
general
market,
that
you're
affecting
futures
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
maybe
you
need
to
adopt
the
board
of
trade's
position
that
they're
both
subject
to
the
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
word
transactions
in
modify
just
foreign
currency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then
you
do
have
transactions
in
an
option.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
means
you
can
have
a
transaction
in
an
option.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
there's
no
such
thing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there's
no
such
thing
as
a
repurchase
future
i
suppose.
