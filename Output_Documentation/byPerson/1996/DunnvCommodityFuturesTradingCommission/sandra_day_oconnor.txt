now,
if
it
were
a...
an
off-exchange
futures
deal--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
it
were
an
off-exchange
futures--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--agreement
that
we
were
dealing
with,
i
guess
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission...
both
parties
agree,
it
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
shouldn't
futures
and
options
be
treated
the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
the
treasury
amendment
didn't
really
speak
of
the
options.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
are
some
holdings
that
distinguish
transactions
in
from
a
future
or
an
option
agreement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stumpp,
i
thought
section...
7
u.s.
code,
section
6(c)
had
some
specific
bearing
on
this
case,
and
it's
entitled
regulated
option
trading
and
says
that
no
person
shall
offer
to
enter
into
or
enter
the
execution
of
any
transaction
involving
any
commodity
regulated
under
this
chapter
which
is
of
the
character
of
or
is
commonly
known
to
the
trade
as
an
option
contrary
to
any
rule,
regulation,
or
order
of
the
commission.
and
then
subsection
(f)
of
the
same
section
says
that
nothing
in
this
chapter
is
deemed
to
govern
or
be
applicable
to
any
transaction
in
an
option
on
foreign
currency
traded
on
a
national
security
exchange.
apparently
the
purpose
there
is
to
preserve
sec
jurisdiction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
on
the
first...
on
subparagraph
(b)
it
seems
to
give
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
the
power
to
regulate
or
prohibit
some
transaction
in
the
character
of
an
option.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
to
reach
your
conclusion,
you
have
to
say,
as
you
do
apparently,
that
an
option
with
respect
to
foreign
currency
is
a
transaction
in
foreign
currency.
that's
necessary
for
your
result.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
you
both
agree
that
it's
a...
an
option
is
a
transaction
in.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
a
transaction
involving
a
commodity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
regulations
has
the
cftc
imposed
on
the
market
in
foreign
currency
options?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
just
prohibit
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
it
be
said
that
the
trade
here
was
under
one
of
the
exceptions?
commercial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
sound
coming
out
of
your
speaker.
are
you
not
speaking
into
it
or
is
there
a
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
connected.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
you'll
have
to
because
it
isn't
working.
that
might
be
a
good
idea.
that
or
don't
say
anything
important.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
mr.
minear,
now
do
you
agree
that
if
the
petitioners
had
engaged
in
exactly
the
same
scheme,
including
misrepresentations
and
all,
with
their
customers
in
trading
in
off-exchange
foreign
currency
futures,
the
cftc
would
have
no
jurisdiction
over
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
same
conduct
exactly--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
in
connection
with
futures.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
let's
say
it's
an
off-exchange.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they're
off,
not
a
board
of
trade.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
option
can?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wouldn't
there
be
even
less
reason
to
find
an
exception
for
an
option
where
the
buyer
doesn't
have
to
go
ahead
with
it?
he
can
not
exercise
the
option.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it's
just
a
strange
argument
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
on
this
point,
hasn't
the
government
taken
different
positions
at
times
and
said
that
both
futures
and
options
in
foreign
currency
were
excluded
from
cftc
jurisdiction?
isn't
that
the
position
the
government
has
taken
at
times
in
the
past.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
why
is
any
deference
owed
here?
isn't
it
a
litigation
position
and
not
anything
entitled
to
deference?
