she
said
futures
i
think.
justice
david

well,
you
say
whatever
type.
now,
this
type
was
not
known
at
the
time
of
the
amendment.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
tell
me
who
were
the
traders
that
the
treasury
had
in
mind
when
it
proposed
this
amendment.
i
take
it
it's
the
large
banks
i
assume.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
are
the
major...
that's
in
part
an
answer
to
my
next
question.
are
the
same
major
banks
for
whom
the
treasury
had
concern
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
proposed
engaging
in
the
kind
of
option
trading
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i
know
in
'74
they
couldn't
have,
but
today.
they're
trading
options
the
same
way
they
used
to
be
trading
futures.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
they're
now--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
if
the
concern
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
originally
proposed
was
to
keep
this
business
within
the
united
states,
or
keeps
the...
keep
the
american
banks
competitive,
that
concern
of
policy
i
presume
then
would
be
just
as
applicable
to
options
trading
today
as
it
was
for
future
tradings
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
we're
going
to
have
to
draw
the
distinction
with
respect
to
the
sort
of
recapture
proviso
at
the
end,
aren't
we,
because
that
refers
to
sales
for
future
delivery?
so,
that's
going
to
draw
back
the
futures
contracts,
but
it's
not
going
to
draw
back
the
options
contracts.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
sale
for
future
delivery
is
a
fairly
straightforward
description,
isn't
it,
of
the
future
versus
the
options
contract?
