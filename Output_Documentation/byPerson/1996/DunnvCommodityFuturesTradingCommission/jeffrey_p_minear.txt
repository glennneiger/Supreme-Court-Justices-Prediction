mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
submit
that
foreign
currency
futures
are
transactions
in
foreign
currency,
but
foreign
currency
options
are
not.
we
think
that
is
the
most
accurate
and
sensible
interpretation
of
the
treasury
amendment's
text.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
i...
we
disagree
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
a...
we
say
that
a
futures
contract
is
properly
described
as
a
transaction
in
a
commodity
because
it
is
an
actual
sale
of
the
commodity
although
at
a...
for
settlement
and
delivery
at
a
later
date.
an
options
contract
by
contrast
is
a
sale
of
a
future
right
to
buy
or
sell
the
commodity.
it
involves
the
commodity,
but
it
is
not
a
transaction
in
the
commodity
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would
be
fair
to
characterize
it
as
a
transaction
involving
a
commodity.
and
in
fact,
that
is
how
the
cea
actually
characterizes
it,
and
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
concerns
with
treating
a
transaction
in
foreign
currency
as
a
transaction
in
foreign
currency
options.
petitioners
argue--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
to
a
large
extent,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
let
me
first
say
that
government
securities
are
traded
on
the
exchanges,
on
the
chicago
board
of
trade.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
there
the
chicago
board
of
trade
is
concerned
that
that
type
of
trading
introduces
the
possibility
of
fraud,
just
as
the
cftc
is
concerned
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
true.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it's
also
important
to
point
out,
however,
that
it's
not
clear
if
there
is
actually
a
market
off...
over
the
counter
in
government
security
options.
there
certainly
is
a
market
in
government
security
futures
and
there
is
a
market
on
options
on
government
security
futures,
but
we
do
not
have
anything
in
the
record--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
that
simply
reflects
what
happened
in
1974.
when
congress
enacted
the
cea
in
1974,
it
was
sweeping
in
a
large
number
of
new
commodities
that
were
subject
to
regulation.
at
that
time
all
options
had
been
prohibited.
there
was
no
allowable
option
trading
on
the
regulated
commodities.
the
treasury
department
noted
that
could
raise
problems
with
regard
to
certain
futures
trading
in
foreign
currency,
as
well
as
trading
in
certain
types
of
other
financial
instruments,
and
it
responded
to
that
market
condition
that
existed
at
that
time.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
also
that
congress
also
provided
that
the
cftc
can
exempt
transactions
if
in
fact
it
determines
that
it
is
appropriate
not
to
regulate
them.
so,
congress
actually
did
provide
for
these
types
of
problems,
these
new
markets
that
would
emerge.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
could
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
generally
foreign
currency
options
would
be
subject
to
the
usual
requirements
of
a
contract
market
and
the
usual
requirements
that
govern
options
trading.
for
the
most
part,
options
trading
off
of
exchanges
is
not
allowed.
there
are
certain
exemptions
that
do
apply,
however.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
have
largely
prohibited
it
with
certain
very
important
exceptions,
however.
there
is
a
dealer
exception
which
covers
people
who
are
dealing
in
the
retail
trade
of
a
particular
commodity
at
issue.
there's
a
trade
option
exemption
also
that
deals
with
people
who
are
engaging
in
a
transaction
for
a
commercial
purpose.
and
then
there's
also
what
is
known
as
the
swap
exemption
which
covers
certain
types
of
transactions
which
may
or
may
not
be
futures
or
options
but,
the
cftc
has
determined,
can
safely
be
subject
to...
can
be
engaged
in
without
substantial
problems
of
fraud.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
qualify
for
any
of
the
exceptions
here.
and
in
fact,
the
trading
that
was
involved
here
is
exactly
the
problem
that
congress
was
concerned
about
in
1974,
the
so-called
ponzi
scheme
of
trading
in
naked
options
and
then
not
being
able
to
cover--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
largely
true.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it's
not
clear,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
in
the
record
what
effects
this
will
have
on
the
foreign
currency
markets.
but
i
think
more
specifically
to
your
point,
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
what
congress
really
intended,
and
what
it
said
in
the
statute.
that
is
what
we
have
used
as
the
guide
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
what...
we
think...
congress
had
in
its
mind
was
the
problem
of
futures
trading
and
not
options
trading,
and
we
think
the
language
it
used
actually
indicates
that.
and
it's
a
good
deal
more
than
simply
the
word
in.
we
also
ask
you
to
look
at
two
other
provisions
of
the
cea,
section
2(i)
which
describes
the
cftc's
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
section
6(c)
which
grants
the
cftc
authority
to
regulate
options.
in
both
of
those
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
those
are
in
our
brief.
the
section
2(i)
appears
at
page
1a
of
the
appendix,
and
the
relevant
provision
of
section
6(c)
which
is
subsection
(b)
appears
at
page
4.
what
you
note
with
regard
to
both
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i'm
not
sure
if
there
is
a
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
will
try
and
speak
more
loudly
if
that
would
be
of
assistance.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
would
much
prefer
to
speak
to
the
important
matters
here.
and
in
that
regard,
i
think
the
provisions...
these
two
provisions
that
i've
cited
are
important
and
very
significant
because
they
both
mention...
they
discuss
options
and
they
both
describe
them
as
transactions
involving
the
commodity,
and
they
both
use
very
specific
language
to
talk
about
options.
i
think
what's
clear
throughout
the
cea
is
that
when
congress
meant
to
deal
with
options,
it
dealt
with
them
quite
specifically.
it
either
mentioned
them
by
name
or
it
used
the
transactions
involving
terminology.
that
same
language
is
found
also
in
section
2(a)
of
the
cea.
and
we
think
that
that
is
very
significant
in
determining
what
congress
meant
when
it
used
the
more
restrictive
phrase
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
think
there
is
a
very
good
reason--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
they
shculd
be
treated
differently,
and
that
is
congress'
historic
concern
that
options
posed
a
more
serious
risk
of
fraud
than
futures.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
it's
a
matter
of
the
court
looking
to
the
expertise
of
two
bodies:
first,
congress
which
has
continued
to
regulate
options
more
strictly
and
has
vested
authority
for
exceptions
with
the
cftc;
and
then
the
cftc
itself
and
its
assessment
of
whether
these
markets
do
pose
a
serious
risk
or
not.
the
cftc
carefully
examined
the
options
market
in
the
newly
regulated
commodities
in
1976.
it
initially
decided
to
deregulate
that
market
and
it
found
that
there
were
numerous
problems
with
fraud
in
the
marketplace.
in
1978
it
reimposed
those
limitations.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
what
congress
was
doing
in
1974,
it
was
looking
at
the
markets
that
existed
at
that
time,
and
it
was
saying,
yes,
we
feel
we
can
safely
exempt
the
foreign
currency
futures
market,
the
only
market
that
existed
and
the
only
market
that
was
described
in
the
treasury
amendment's...
the
treasury
department's
correspondence
respecting
the
treasury
amendment.
as
to
future
markets
that
might
develop,
cftc
would
be
given
the
authority
to
make
those
judgments
based
on
its
ability
to
gather
the
facts
and
make--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that
is
true,
and
again
i
think
section
5
is
probably
most
notable
for
the
fact
that
it
distinguishes
between
transactions
in
commodities
and
options.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
was
not
to
a
large
extent,
and
with
regard
to
section
5--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
legislative
findings...
you're
talking
about
the
last
two
sentences
of
that
section
which
appear
on
page
3a.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
those
findings
were
added
in
1983,
some
time
after
1974.
many
of
these
markets
have
grown
dramatically.
i
think
that's
the
most
remarkable
effect
about
the
commodities
market,
is
they
have
been
subject
to
dramatic
expansion
since
1974.
and
the
cftc
is
exercising
judgment
in
terms
of
where
there
are
serious
problems
of
fraud.
they
believe
there
are
serious
problems
of
fraud
in
the
foreign
currency
market
as
indicated
by
this
very
case,
and
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
not
necessarily
true,
your
honor.
that...
i
think
that
that
brief
suggested
that
some
of
these
transactions
would
be...
would
fall
within
the
description
of
an
investment
contract,
and
therefore
would
be
a
security
for
purposes
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
you
can
avoid
the
investment
contract
terminology...
or
the
requirement...
the
satisfy...
you
can
avoid
a...
creating
a
transaction
that
is
an
investment
contract
by
simply
how
you
structure
it.
so,
fraudulent
bucket
shops
can
in
fact
avoid
that
problem
by
simply
avoiding
a...
structuring
their
dealings
in
a
way
that
does
not
create
an
investment
contract.
so,
there's
still
a
residual
need
for
cftc
oversight
in
some
of
these
areas
unless--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
could
be.
it
depends.
i
think
that
the
swap
exemption
is
an
example
of
that.
it
discusses
the
fact
that
there
are
very
sophisticated
transactions
that
are
being
engaged
in
that
may
have
the
aspects
of
a
future
but
are
not
actually
a
future.
and
in
those
situations,
the
cftc
has
carefully
looked
at
the
transactions,
has
indicated
which
ones
they
think
are
permissible
and
which
ones
are
not.
and
that
is
in
fact
a
very
reasonable
way
to
go
forward
with
respect
to
these--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
we
think
that
what
congress
did
in
1974
is
it
looked
at
the
futures
market
as
it
existed
then
and
said
those...
that
area
is
exempt.
there
are
no...
there
will
not
be
cftc
regulation
in
that
area.
but
as
to
these
new
instruments
that
come
in,
we'll
make
a
case-by-case
determination.
we'll
vest
that
authority
with
the
cftc
which
has
the
authority
and
the
time
and
the
expertise
to
evaluate
these
transactions
and
determine
whether
or
not
they're
serving
a
useful
market
purpose
and
whether
or
not
they
pose
an
unacceptable
risk
of
fraud
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think
all
of
these
can
raise
very
complex
economic
questions
in
terms
of
the
relationship
between
the
options
market
and
the
futures
market.
but
i
think
we
can
say
this,
that
with
regard
to
commercial
expectations,
the
futures
market
is
secure.
with
regard
to
the
newly
created
options
market,
those
questions
ought
to
be
evaluated
by
someone.
we
shouldn't
simply
provide
an
open-ended
exception
that
says...
simply
says
that
anything
that
involves
a
foreign
currency
is
going
to
be
exempt
from
regulation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
we
think
the
problem
with
that
position
is
it
runs
into
the
difficulty
with
the
board
of
trade
proviso
that
was
discussed
earlier.
it's
clear
that
congress
did
want
futures
transactions
to
be...
that
were
conducted
on
a
board
of
trade
to
be
subject
to
cftc
regulation.
so,
we
think
that
that's
a
textual
problem
of
taking
that
approach.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
are
saying
that
there
would
be...
if
you
hold
that
options
are
excluded,
there
will
be
a
significant
portion
of
the
market
that
will
not
be
subject
to
regulation
by
anyone.
the
treasury
department
does
not
directly
regulate
these
markets
for
fraud.
it
does
regulate
banks
for
safety
and
soundness,
and
as
long
as
these
transactions
take
place
in
the
interbank
market,
that
provides
some
substantial
protection.
but
any
other
protection
would
have
to
come
from
another
agency.
those
agencies
would
be
the
cftc
or
the
sec.
the
problem
with
sec
regulation
here
is
unless
the
transaction
involved
qualifies
as
an
investment
contract
under
this
court's
decision
in
howey,
there
would
not
be--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no
one
is
monitoring
the
futures
contracts
for
fraud,
and
in
part
that
was
because--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the...
and
again,
we're
talking--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--let
me
clarify
this
again
that
with
regard
to
the
over-the-counter
market,
there
is
no
cftc
direct
regulation
of
futures,
but
that
was
based
on
the
congress...
congressional
determination
that
that
was
not
necessary.
congress
has
never
made
an--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
the
context--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
you
will
find
that
they
refer
to
transactions
in
options
in
only
one
case
and
that's
in
section
6c(f)
where
they
say,
transactions...
where
they
actually
refer
to
that
the
cftc
would
have
no
jurisdiction
over
transactions
in
options
on
foreign
currency
traded
on
a
national
securities
exchange.
now,
it's
clear
when
congress
uses
the
term
transactions
in,
i
think
they're
talking
about
a
very
specific
type
of
transaction.
it
is
accurate
to
describe
an
option
as
a
transaction
in
an
option,
a
foreign
currency
option.
i
do
not
think
it's
accurate
to
describe
as
a
transaction
involving...
or
an
options
transaction
as
a
transaction
in
the
foreign
currency,
the
underlying
commodity
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
and
so
that...
and
that
supports
our
view
i
believe.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
our
view
is
this,
that
the
transactions
in
foreign
currency
would
include
spot
transactions,
would
include
cash
forward
transactions,
and
would
include
futures
transactions.
all
three
of
those
transactions
involve
situations
where
you're
actually
purchasing
the
underlying
commodity.
if
you
enter
into
one
of
those
transactions
and
do
nothing
else,
you
will
receive
the
commodity
that's
involved.
we
think
that
options
are
different
because
they
do
not
have
that
distinction.
all
you're
buying
in
that
case
is
a
right.
you're
not
buying
the
underlying
commodity.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
that
would--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--there
would
be
one--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
there
would
be
one
question
that
we'd
ask,
whether
this
is
conducted
on
a
board
of
trade
or
not.
but
let's
assume
it's
not
on
a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
board
of
trade
is
not
necessarily--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--with
your
hypothetical
assuming
it's
not
on
a
board
of
trade.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
that
situation
it's
true
that
the
cftc
would
not
be
able
to
bring
an
enforcement
action,
but
it
might
be
far
more
difficult
to
bring
that
type
of
fraudulent
scheme
and
let
me
explain
why.
i
think
this
is
important.
that
options
are
peculiarly
subject
to
fraud
because
they're
very
easy
to
market
to
an
unsuspecting
public.
they
can
be
sold
very
much
like
a
lottery
ticket.
the
way--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--an
option
can
because
what
you're
telling
the
person
is,
here,
you
pay
this
premium,
a
small
premium,
and
you...
and
the
sky
is
the
limit
on
what
you
might
get
in
the
form
of
your
investment
return.
a
futures
contract...
to
explain
a
futures
contract
to
an
investor
would
be
no
simple
matter
to
begin
with.
but
beyond
that,
it
also...
they
have
to
explain
to
the
person
that
you're
making
an
investment
in
a
future
purchase
and
you
might
be
obligated
to
buy
that
future
commodity.
much
of
this
has
really
to
do
with
the
market
mentality.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
difficulty
here--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
i
think
that
this...
the
answer
here
is
largely
a
part
of
history
and
largely
a
part
of
market
psychology.
but
it
has
always
been
easier
to
market
options
than...
fraudulently
than
futures.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
congress
made
that
determination
in
terms
of
how
it
decided
in
1922,
since
1922,
that
there
would
be
no
options.
options
would
not
be
sold
on
agricultural
commodities
because
they
posed
such
a
danger
of
fraud,
but
futures
would
be
allowed.
and
that
was
the
law
from
1922
until
1974.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
what
it
proves
is
that
in
1974,
the
relevant
time
for
determining
the
treasury
amendment,
congress
continued
to
hold
that
view.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
even
apart
from
the
treasury
amendment,
congress
continued
to
impose
a
ban
on
options
in
1974
even
though
it
was
allowing
trading
in
the
futures
market.
it
simply--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that's
right.
let
me
tell
you
candidly
what
occurred
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
was
called
upon
to
make
a
determination
between
the
treasury
department
and
the
cftc
in
terms
of
what
is
the
appropriate
position
to
take
on
this
case.
he
looked
at
the
statutory
language
here
and
made
the
determination
that
the
cftc's
view
was
more
in
accord
with
the
statutory
language,
and
that's
why
we're
taking
that
position
in
this
case.
so,
this
does
represent
the
view
of
the
solicitor
general
in
determining
what
is
the
best
reading
of
this
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now
i'd
like
to
point
to
some
other
textual
indicia
because
i
think
we
haven't
really
spent
much
time
talking
about
those.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
significant
about
the
treasury
amendment
is
it
actually
does
include
certain
types
of
options
within
its
reach.
it
makes
specific
reference
to
security
warrants
and
also
repurchase
options.
so,
congress
was
aware
that
certain
options
would
be
included
in
the
exclusion
here.
yet,
it
nevertheless
decided
against
including
foreign
currency
options.
one
would
think
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
include
foreign
currency
options
within
the
exclusion,
it
would
have
said
so
expressly
like
it
did
with
regard
to
the
other
options
that
were
involved
here.
we
think
that
they
also...
that
this...
we
also
find
textual
support
from
the
board
of
trade
proviso.
this
has
been
discussed
by
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
it
modifies
all
six
of
the
items
that
are
described
there.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
in
repurchase
options
which
in
that
case
were
specialized...
is
a
specialized
type
of
option.
but
i
think
what
it
indicates
here
is
that
congress--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--you
can
have
a
transaction
in
an
option,
and
we...
our
view
would
be
different
if
congress
had
said
transactions
in
foreign
currency
options,
but
it
simply
said
transactions
in
foreign
currency.
that's
what
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
view
here
on
the
statutory
text.
in
the
treasury
amendment,
congress
said...
exempted
transactions
in
certain
items.
it
did
not
include
foreign
currency
options
among
those,
even
though
it
included
foreign
currency--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--even
though
it
included
other
kinds
of
options.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
not,
and
in
fact
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
is
actually
an
area
where
there's
some
uncertainty,
but
let
me
explain.
we
do
know
what
repurchase
agreements
are,
that
the
repurchase--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
think
options
are
options
on
repurchase
agreements,
and
we
think
that
congress
might
have
been
looking
forward
to
the
possibility
of
options
on
repurchase
agreements.
now,
i
don't
know
if
that
market
exists
or
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
it's
primarily
government
securities.
in
fact,
i
think
it's...
that
term
is
used
almost
exclusively.
if
you
look
to
a
financial
dictionary,
you'd
find
that
when
we
talk
about
repurchase
agreements,
we're
largely
talking
about
parking
government
securities
with
one
holder
for
a
temporary
period
and
then
selling
them
back.
so,
what
we
really
have
here
with
repurchase
options...
and
i
think
this
congress
was
envisioning
the
possibility
that
repurchase
agreements
might
be
included.
repurchase--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
although
this
more
often
takes
place
between
banks.
they
can
take
place
between
the
federal
reserve
board
and
a
bank
or
between
the
banks.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
these
are
all
government
securities,
so
they
fall
within
the
government
security
exemption
anyway.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
it
cannot
be
applied
to
options.
there's
a
possible
argument--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
might
well
be
the
case.
but
again,
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
words
of
the
statute
say,
and
that
is
what
we've
used
as
our
guide
here.
the
term,
unless
such
transactions
involve
the
sale
thereof
for
future
delivery...
and
i'm
reading
on
page
2a
of
our
appendix.
we
think
that's
a
term
of
art
that
really
refers
specifically
to
futures,
and
i
think
you
can
see
that
if
you
look
directly
below
at
section
5
which
says
transactions...
this
is
the
legislative
finding
section.
transactions
in
commodities
involving
the
sale
thereof
for
future
delivery
is
commonly
conducted
on
boards
of
trade
and
known
as
futures.
so,
that
proviso--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
1974
language
actually
i
think
can
be
traced
back
to
1922.
i
believe--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
language
respecting
options
which
appears
on
page
3a
of
our
appendix,
and
it
begins
at
about
halfway
below
the
page.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
furthermore,
transactions
which
are
of
the
character
of
and
are
commonly
known
to
the
trade
as
options.
again,
here's
congress
using
the
term,
very
specific
term,
options
when
it
means
to
deal
with
options.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
was
added
in
1983.
now,
i
would
like
to
reemphasize
a
point
here
that
i
think
is
very
important
to
bear
in
mind,
and
that
is
the
treasury
amendment
is
an
exemption
from
a
general
regulatory
program,
and
if
there
are
doubts
about
its
reach,
we
think
the
more
narrow
interpretation
is
the
preferred
one
here.
that
rule
has
particular
force
where
congress
has
appointed
an
expert
agency,
namely,
the
cftc
to...
and
given
it
authority
to
provide
further
exemptions
from
the
regulatory
program.
it's
the
cftc
that
has
the
expertise
in
this
area
and
can
make
those
determinations
of
whether
or
not
the
transactions
at
issue
pose
the
threat
of
fraud
that
was
the
underlying
concern
of
the
securities...
the
commodity
exchange
act
when
it
was
enacted
in
1936
and
when
it
was
expanded
in
1974.
we
think
that
petitioners'
non-textual
argument
really
is
ultimately
unpersuasive.
their
notion
is
simply
that
it
would
be
illogical
for
congress
to
exempt
both
foreign
currency
futures
and
foreign
currency
options
because
they
serve
similar
marketing
and
hedging
functions.
but
ultimately
congress
has
always
recognized
the
difference
between
futures
and
options.
it
has
done
so
in
the
agricultural
commodities,
and
we
believe
it
has
done
so
in
these
other
commodities
as
well.
we
think
congress
has
drawn
a
line
here,
and
it
has
drawn
a
line
between
foreign
currency
futures
and
options.
it
had
a
reasonable
and
sound
basis
for
drawing
that
line,
namely,
the
fact
that
options
pose
more
serious
risks
of
fraud.
finally,
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
although
we
believe
that
the
statutory
language
here
is
clear,
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
that,
then
it's
appropriate
to
give
deference
to
the
cftc's
view
as
the
administrative
agency
that
is
administering
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
you
do
in
fact.
in
fact,
in
cftc
v.
schor,
this
court
made
that
point.
it
was
a
question
whether
cftc
had
jurisdiction
over
reparation
proceedings,
but
you
did
recognize
that
we
do...
it's
almost
inevitable...
inevitably
necessary
to
give
deference
to
an
agency's
determination.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
think
that
the
court's
explanation
of
deference
in
smiley
is
that
congress
has
delegated
this
authority
to
the
agency
that's
charged
with
administration
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
united
states
filed
a
brief
in
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--taking
that
position.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
cftc's
position
is
not
a
litigation
position.
the
commission
voted
on
whether
or
not
to
bring
this
suit,
and
so
it
is
conducted
with
sufficient
authoritativeness
and
deliberateness
to
be
entitled
to
deference.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
