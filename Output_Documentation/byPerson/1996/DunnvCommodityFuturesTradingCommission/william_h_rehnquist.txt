chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
95-1181,
william
c.
dunn
and
delta
consultants,
inc.
v.
commodity
futures
trading
commission.
mr.
stumpp.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
couldn't
you
deliver
eurodollars,
mr.
stumpp?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
good
reason.
[laughter]
may
i
ask--
--in
answer
to
the
gap
problem
that
has
been
raised,
one
of
your
friends
said
that
what
dunn/delta
are
doing...
that
doesn't
fall
between
the
regulators
because
clearly
what
dunn
is
doing
falls
within
the
sec
bailiwick
because
you
are...
what
you're
doing
is
having
contracts
with
your
investors
and
those
would
count
as
securities.
do
you
agree
that
that
would
be
so,
that
you
might
escape
the
cftc,
but
you're
with
the
sec?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
stumpp.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
but
the
legislative
findings
deal
with...
in
section
5
deal
with
both
futures
and
options.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
congress
really
wasn't
thinking
about
options
at
all
when
it
passed
this
bill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
did
it
include
options
in
the
legislative
findings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
presume
those
are
as
good
as
any
other
findings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
know
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
all
that
proves
is
what
you're
saying
was
true
in
1922.
it
doesn't
prove
it's
true
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
adopt
your
view
of
the
treasury
amendment,
not
if
we
adopt
the
petitioners'.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
minear,
you
said
some
part
of
that
legislative
finding
was
added
in
1983?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
added
and
what
was
put
in
in
1974?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
was
added
in
1983
that
wasn't
there...
but
was
there
in
1974?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
furthermore?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
was
added
in
1983.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
a
matter
of
the
agency's
jurisdiction,
wouldn't
it?
we
don't
ordinarily
give
deference
on
the
jurisdictional
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
stumpp,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
to
just
briefly
touch
on
a
few
points
raised,
the
exemptions,
the
dealer
trade
option
and
swap
exemption,
i
think
are
adequately
covered
in
the
amici
briefs.
they're
limited
exemptions.
they're
certainly
well
subject
to
cftc
interpretation,
modification,
or
withdrawal.
the
point
that
continues
to
be
made
concerning
that
options
have
been
dealt
with
differently
by
the
cftc.
as
i
said
it
is
not
relevant
once
you...
once
the
cftc
acknowledges,
as
they
have,
that
the
foreign
currency
options
market
didn't
exist
at
that
time
and
the
agricultural
options
regulation,
whatever
purpose
may
have
been
served
specifically
dealing
with
agricultural
options,
would
not
be
relevant
to
the
expansion
of
the
definition
of
commodity
in
the
'74
amendments
beyond
the
traditional
agricultural
commodities.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stumpp.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-1181,
dunn
versus
commodity
futures
trading
commission
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
