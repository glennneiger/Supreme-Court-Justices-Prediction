justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
would
you
run
by
me
what
you
said
about
dictum
because
the
second
circuit
said
we
might
have
gone
on
another
ground
but
we
didn't.
the
ground
that
we
went
on
was
the
first
one.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
in
that
earlier
case,
the
court
didn't
decide
it
on
the
basis
that
it
was
on-exchange
trading.
it
decided
it
on
the
basis
that
it
was
an
option.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
their
holding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
well,
i
just
wanted
to
be
clear
that
you
recognized
it
was
a
holding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
couldn't
in
have
a
narrower
meaning
given
that
the
statute
also
uses
the
word
involving?
we
think
of
transactions
in
interstate
commerce
as
different
from
transactions
affecting
interstate
commerce.
we
have
that
kind
of
difference
in
the
law.
why
shouldn't
it
apply
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
i
may
just
vary
justice
breyer's
question,
yes,
these
agencies
right
now
do
not
seem
to
be
in
agreement,
but
if
this
court
made
a
decision
that
would
say
what
the
law
is,
then
does
it
follow
that
there
are
going
to
be
this
tight
regulation
then
that
would
drive
everyone
to
the
london
or
other
markets
instead
of
reasonable
exemptions
being
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
respect
to
this
very
case,
mr.
minear,
the
point
that
was
made
i
think
in
the
chase
manhattan
brief
about
the
sec
has
ample
jurisdiction
to
take
care
of
this
kind
of
operation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
they
are
so
close
that
you
can't
tell
them
apart,
what
sense
would
it
make
to
say
that
the
futures
are
out
but
the
options
are
in?
