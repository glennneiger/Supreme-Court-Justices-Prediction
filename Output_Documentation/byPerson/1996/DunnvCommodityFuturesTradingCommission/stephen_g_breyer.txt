but
you
don't
deliver
until
you...
until
somebody
exercises
the
option;
whereas,
under
the
futures
contract,
if
the
contract
is
not
canceled,
you
do
have
to
deliver.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
think
that
the
language
is
open
to
either
interpretation,
and
at
the
time
they
enacted
it,
nobody
really
thought
about
the
options
market
developing,
and
if
there's
a
good
practical
way
to
get
your...
the
industry's
concerns
dealt
with
through
negotiations
between
treasury
and
cftc
dividing
responsibility,
why
wouldn't
we
then,
other
things
being
equal,
say,
all
right,
the
people
who
administer
this,
apparently
the
treasury
and
the
cftc,
think
it's
better
to
read
the
language
as
inclusive
and
then
get
the
exclusion
through
negotiation
with
the
industry
between
the
agencies?
it
introduces
more
flexibility,
deal
more
subtly
with
congressional
and
treasury
purposes,
et
cetera.
why
not
go
in
that
direction?
i'm
not
saying
i
would.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
your
response
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
was
thinking
they
could
work
out...
they
don't
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
noted
that
that
brief
was
filed
for
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
and
for
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae,
whereas
the
opposition
on
the
merits
is
just
for
the
cftc.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
for
a
minute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm...
it
may
well
be
that
the
language
determines
this
in
your
favor,
but
if
it
does
not
and
if
it
really
is
open
and
if
congress
did
in
fact
regulate...
exempt
the
foreign
transactions
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
treasury
letter,
then
is
there
any
reason
why,
in
a
world
where
options
transactions
now
serve
the
same
purposes
and
are
used
to
the
same
extent
as
futures
transactions,
the
result
should
differ?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
if
the
language
is
open
and
the
world
is
such
that
the
purpose
is
the
same
and
the
treasury
department
apparently
thinks
that's
what
it
meant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
isn't
so,
that
is
to
say,
if
in
today's
world
it's
just
as
easy
to
be
fraudulent
or
not
fraudulent
in
respect
to
a
futures
transaction
when
engaged
in
by
thousands
of
people
as
a
options
transaction,
then
what
do
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
it
like
the
commerce
clause
not
foreseeing
the
automobile?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
refer
me
to
something
just
in
respect
to
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy?
i
had
assumed
throughout
this
we
weren't
discussing
no
regulation
of
fraud.
i
thought
the
issue
was
who
would
regulate:
cftc
on
the
one
hand
or
sec
and
treasury
on
the
other.
now
you're
saying
that
if
we
hold
that
the
cftc
does
not
have
the
authority,
no
one
has
the
authority
in
respect
to
a
significant
number
of
off-exchange
option
currency
transactions.
now,
is
that
so?
is
that
what
you're
saying,
and
if
it
is,
where
would
i
find
out
the
scope
of
that
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that
isn't
a
rule
in
thin
air.
that's
the
rule
of
what
congress
would
have
liked
the
courts
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
anything
here
where
it's
the
treasury
amendment,
why
wouldn't
you
think
congress
would
like
the
courts
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
treasury,
if
anyone?
