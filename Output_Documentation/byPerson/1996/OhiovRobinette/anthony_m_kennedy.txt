under
state
law,
does
the
officer
have
the
discretion
to
give
or
not
to
give
a
ticket
after
he
talks
to
the
motorist?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does...
is
cite
the
same
as
giving
a
ticket?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
he
may
cite
or
warn,
and
that
obviously
takes
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
make
that
determination
of
what
he's
going
to
do?
i
take
it
the
officer
has
a
certain
amount
of
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
he
has
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
time
within
which
to
exercise
that
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
once
he
says,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
a
ticket,
can
he
change
his
mind?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there's
a
flippant
response,
or
a
response
that
indicates
that
maybe
the
person
has
less
regard
for
the
law
than
the
officer
thought
at
first?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
quite
without
reference
to
a
search,
the
officer
would
be
entitled
to
detain
the
motorist
after
the
officer
changed
his
mind
and
said,
well,
based
on
what
your
remarks
are,
i've
changed
my
mind.
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
ticket.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
no
right
to
leave
once
the
officer
proceeds
in
that
way
until
the
ticket
is
written.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
state
law
is
consistent
with
our
cases,
and
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
at
that
point
he
could
have
changed
his
mind
and
said,
well,
i've
given
you
a
warning,
but
after
thinking
about
it
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
ticket
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
he
could--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
you
said
earlier
he
could
change
his
mind.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
asking
the
question
to
determine
his
right
to
detain
the
motorist.
