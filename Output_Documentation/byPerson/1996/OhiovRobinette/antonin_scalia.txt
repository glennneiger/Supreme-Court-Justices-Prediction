justice
antonin
scalia
after
the
warning
has
already...
is
the...
it's
a
written
warning?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
give
them
both
a
written
warning
and
then
after
that
say,
in
addition
to
that
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
ticket?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
do
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
do
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i'm
asking
you,
what
do
you
base
your
answer
on
as
to
state
law
as
to
whether,
having
issued
a
warning,
you
can
then,
in
light
of
a
flippant
answer
or
anything
else,
void
the
warning
and
issue
a
traffic
ticket?
we
can't
do
that.
i
mean,
when
we
issue
a
judgment,
if
the
lawyer
who
loses...
who
wins
makes
some
flippant
comment
about
our
judgment--
[laughter]
--we
can't
call
or
go
back
and
say,
wait
a
minute,
we've
thought
about
it
again.
now,
a
policeman
can
do
that,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know
he
has
the
discretion
to
do
that.
we
have
discretion
whether
to
find
for
the
petitioner
or
for
the
respondent,
but
having
done
so,
we
cannot
then
change
our
mind.
what
makes
you
say
that
a
policeman
can
change
his
mind?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
you
don't
base
this
on
any
case
law
that
you
know
of.
this
is
just
your
own--
--well,
common
sense.
ms.
ingram,
is
that
what
happened
here,
or
did
he
just
get
a
warning
and
then
we
went
into
this
business
about,
may
i
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
so
even
after
the
ticket
is
issued?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
say
the
officer
is
still
in
control
and
the
person
can't
leave,
even
after
he
gives
him
a
final
ticket?
they're
still
standing
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
officer
in
control?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
officer
isn't
in
control
in
that
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he's
not
free
to
go
when
all
that's
been
issued
is
a
warning,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gornstein,
just
so
i
understand
your
argument,
you
were
saying
that
all
of
the
reasons
why
there
was
continuing
detention
set
forth
in
the
opinion
as
opposed
to
the
one
perhaps
set
forth
in
number
2
of
the
syllabus
are
all
invalid
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
it's
either...
it's
either
part
2
of
the
appendix
or
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
syllabus
or
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gornstein,
maybe...
maybe
we
should
adopt
a
new
rule
that
in
addition
to
when
you're
still
in
custody,
there's
another
situation
in
which
things
have
to
be
made
absolutely
clear,
and
that
is,
when
your
denial
of
permission
for
a
search
may
impose
upon
you
some
sanction
that
otherwise
wouldn't
be
imposed.
i
mean,
there
is
the
suggestion
here
that
even
if
this
person
was
no
longer
under
custody,
his
saying
no
to
the
search
of
his
car
might
have
produced
a
traffic
ticket.
i
agree,
it's...
i
would
have
taken
the
traffic
ticket
rather
than
the
conviction
for
marijuana,
but
does
that
coercion
invalidate
the
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
your
position
that
if
the
ohio
supreme
court
says,
we
are
basing
our
interpretation
of
the
ohio
constitution's
unreasonable
searches
and
seizure
provision
upon
the
interpretation
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
given
to
the
federal
provision,
but
it
is
nonetheless
an
independent
provision
of
the
ohio
constitution,
you
think
that's
enough
to
get
around
michigan
v.
long?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
it's
ours.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
our
cases
indicate
that
if
you're
basing
your
interpretation
of
state
law
upon
the
federal
constitution,
even
though
you
say
it's
a
separate
provision
of
state
law,
the
issue
is
not
whether
it's
a
separate
provision
of
state
law,
it's
whether
your
interpretation
of
it
rests
upon
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
good
for
him,
so
long
as
he
hasn't
violated
the
federal
constitution.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
it's
effective
doesn't
show
that
it's
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
just
gone
around
on
that.
that
has
to
do
with
his
subjective
intentions,
and
the
issue
was
whether
objectively
an
officer
could
have
asked...
he
still
had
to
issue
the
warning.
he
hadn't
issued
the
warning
yet,
had
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
determined
he
was
going
to
issue
a
warning,
but
he
hadn't
issued
it,
and
the
question
is
whether,
knowing
there
was
still
going
to
be
interaction,
a
reasonable
officer
could
have
had
the
intention
of
having
him
exit
the
car
just
to
be
sure
he
wasn't
armed.
that's
perfectly
okay.
but
let...
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
ruppert,
you
are
not
contending
that
this
is
invalid
because
there
was
some
coercion
placed
upon
the
motorist
in
his
knowing
that
if
he
didn't
allow
the
search
he
might
get
a
traffic
ticket
instead
of
just
a
warning.
that's
not
in
this
case,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
in
your
question
presented,
and
it's
not
before
us,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
ruppert--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
ruppert,
your
question
presented
still
only
presents
the
question
of
whether
this
transaction
was
unlawful
because
the
detention
hadn't
concluded.
it
doesn't
raise
the
other
question
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
question
is,
why
was
the
detention
found
to
be
illegal,
and
what
the
government
says
is,
there
are
only
two
alternatives,
number
1
for
the
reasons
set
forth
on
the
opinion,
but
both
of
those
are
on
their
face
wrong
under
federal
law,
or
perhaps
it
was
unlawful
because
of
the
reasons
set
forth
in
number
2
of
the
syllabus,
and
that's
what
we're
debating
about
now,
isn't
it,
whether
the
mere
fact
that
the
officer
did
not
give
notice
that
you
were
free
to
leave
rendered
it
unlawful.
are
you
content
to
rest
the
debate
on
that,
or
do
you
think
that
we
have
to
look
somewhere
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
still
think
that
syllabus
1
could
mean
that
the
detention
was
unlawful
for
a
reason
that
is
neither
set
forth
in
the
opinion
nor
is
set
forth
in
syllabus
number
2?
we
should
read
it
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
not
the
facts.
what
principle
of
law
do
you
think
rendered
the
determination
in
syllabus
number
1
that
the
detention
was...
had
not
ended?
what
principle
of
law
was
that
based
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
duration
of
the
detention.
