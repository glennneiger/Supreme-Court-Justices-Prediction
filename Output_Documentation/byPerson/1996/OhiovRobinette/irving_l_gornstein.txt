mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
categorically
requires
an
officer
who
has
stopped
a
motorist
to
inform
the
motorist
that
he
is
legally
free
to
leave
before
any
interaction
between
them
can
be
viewed
as
consensual.
our
position--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
that
you
should
not--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
is
possible,
if
you
concluded
that
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case
the
respondent
would
not
have
felt
free
to
leave
in
light
of
the
officer's
conduct
in
this
case,
you
could
affirm
the
judgment.
we
would
suggest
that
you
go
on
and
conclude,
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
he
was
free
to
leave
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
ohio
supreme
court,
itself,
has
not
made
that
judgment
except
based
on
the
free-to-leave
warning
rule
which
appears
in
the
syllabus.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
the
first
point
in
the
syllabus
presupposes--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--this
is
from
app
1
in
the
petition.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
says,
when
the
motivation
behind
a
police
officer's
continued
detention
of
a
person
is
not
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
violation,
so
that
presupposes
a
continued
detention
and
that
it's
not
related
to
the
violation.
now,
nothing
in
that
tells
you
when
the
court
as
a
whole
concluded
that
those
two
things
were
true,
and
i
would
suggest
that
you
should
look
not
at
what
the
opinion
writer
said...
he
gave
several
different
points
in
which
the
opinion
writer
concluded
that
there
was
a
continued
detention
and
that
there
was
conduct
unrelated
to
the
violation
going
on,
and
the
only
thing
the
court
said
appears
in
number
2,
syllabus
2,
which
when
you
put
the
two
together,
i
think
the
only
holding
of
the
court
is
there
was
continued
detention
at
the
time
the
consent
was
sought
because
of
the
failure
to
give
the
free-to-leave
warning,
and
that
questioning
was
unrelated
to
the
violation.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
first
point,
it
would...
the
opinion
writer's
view
is
flawed
for
two
reasons,
and
that
is,
1)
he
relies
on
the
motivation
of
the
officer,
which
under
this
court's
decision
in
wren
is
simply
incorrect,
it's
an
objective
test,
and
the
second
point
is,
at
the
point
in
time
at
which
the
officer
ordered
the
respondent
out
of
the
car,
he
had
not
yet
issued
a
warning,
he
had
not
yet
returned
a
license,
so
it
simply
is
not
true
that
the
business
of
the
traffic
stop
had
been
completed
at
that
point.
i
think
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
opinion
writer
was
suggesting
was
that
the
officer
was
required
to
reach
into
the
car
and
to
give
back
the
license
and
to
say,
here's
your
warning,
rather
than
order
the
person
out
of
the
car
for
those
purposes,
but
i
think
under
this
court's
decision
in
mimms,
it
is
very
clear
that
an
officer
can
do
those
two
things
outside
the
car.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
is
correct,
but
as
i
was
just
saying,
justice
ginsburg,
it
does
not
matter
under
the
fourth
amendment
what
the
officer's
subjective
motivation
was,
it
is
what
is
a
reasonable
conduct
under
the
circumstances,
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
mimms,
as
long
as
the
business
of
that
traffic
stop
was
not
completed,
a
reasonable
officer
can
order
a
person
out
of
the
car
to
issue
the
warning--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
it
had
to
do
with
officer
safety.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
what
mimms
says
is
that
officer
safety
is
categorically
implicated
every
time--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
every
time
the
officer
wants
to
have
interaction
with
a
motorist,
he
can
take
into
account
his
safety,
yes,
that
a
reasonable
officer--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
justice
ginsburg,
the...
that
was
what
the
officer
said
he
wanted
to,
but
the
question
is,
what
could
a
reasonable
officer
have
done
in
those
circumstances
where
the
business
of
the
traffic
stop
was
not
yet
completed,
and
a
reasonable
officer
can
take
into
account
safety
in
issuing
the
warning
and
giving
the
lecture
and
returning
the
license.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
am
not--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
am
not
familiar
with
any
additional
holding,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
correct.
the
reason
that
the
ohio
supreme
court's
per
se
test
should
be
rejected,
for
three
reasons.
first,
this
court
has
in
a
wide
variety
of
contexts
decided
whether
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
relevant
inquiry
has
always
been
whether
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
an
officer's
conduct
would
have
communicated
to
a
reasonable
person
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave.
that
is
the
test
that
has
been
applied
in
street
encounters,
in
airports,
on
buses--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
don't
think
it
is
entirely
irrelevant,
justice
stevens.
i
think
in
this
case
an
admission--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
it
tends
to
show
whether...
it's
of
some
relevance,
but
then
you
have
to
go
on
from
there
and
examine
whether...
what
a
reasonable
officer
would
do.
it
is
not
dispositive.
similarly,
the
cases
here,
what
this
particular
person
thought
is
of
some
relevance.
you
still
then
have
to
go
on
and
conclude--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
is
of
some
relevance,
but
it
ends
up
being--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--not
dispositive,
because
a
reasonable
officer
could
always
conclude
that
it
is
reasonable
to
order
somebody
out
of
the
car
when
you're
going
to
have
interaction
and
you
haven't
completed
the
work
of
the
stop.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
say
that
you
apply
the
same
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
but
of
course,
in
applying
that
test,
you
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
at
a
later
point
in
time
something
is
consensual
or
a
seizure,
that
at
an
earlier
point
in
time
there
was
a
seizure.
that
is
a
relevant
factor
in
deciding,
but
it
does
not
change
the
ultimate
inquiry,
which
is
whether
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
at
the
later
point
in
time
the
officer's
conduct
would
have
communicated
to
a
reasonable
person
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
does
not,
because
that
is
not
anything
that
the
officer
said
or
communicated
to
this
particular
individual,
and
that
is
the
test
for
deciding
whether
there
is
coercion
in...
for
purposes
of
whether
a
search
should
be
invalidated.
