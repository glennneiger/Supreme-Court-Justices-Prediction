mr.
james
d.
ruppert
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
before
i
discuss
specifically
the
merits
of
the
case,
if
i
might
i'd
like
to
approach
a
ground
which
we
think
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case,
and
that
is
whether
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
for
having
been
improvidently
granted.
the
reason
for
the
position
is
twofold.
number
1,
it
is
clear
that
if
there
are
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds
for
the
decision
of
the
state's
highest
court
that
that
situation,
when
confronted
by
this
court,
is
such
that
the
court
will
generally
not
review
the
case,
and
we
believe
that
is
the
case
here.
the
second
syllabus
starts,
the
right
guaranteed
by
the
federal
and
high
constitution
to
be
secure
in
one's
person
and
property
requires
the
citizen
stopped
for
traffic
offenses
be
clearly
informed
when
they
are
free
to
go.
under
the
law
in
ohio,
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
its
own
inherent
power.
it
did
that
in
arnold
v.
cleveland,
where
it
indicated
that
the
ohio
constitution
is
a
document
of
independent
force.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
would
agree
that
in
some
cases,
but
the
ohio
court
has
also
recognized
its
inherent
power
to
reject--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--i
understand--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--i
don't
think
so
in
my
first
analysis,
justice
o'connor,
and
my
reason
for
saying
that
is
when
one
looks
at
the
syllabus,
which
indicates
the
right
which
the
court
is
addressing
is
guaranteed
by
the
federal
and
ohio
constitution.
under
ohio
law,
under
williamson
heater
company,
that's
cited
in
the
brief,
the
syllabus
of
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
states
the
law
of
ohio.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
would
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
would
be
appropriate,
your
honor.
there
is
an
issue
concerning
michigan
v.
long,
given
subsequent
cases
that
arose.
coleman
v.
thompson
and
ylst
v.
nunnemaker,
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
ylst
v.
nunnemaker,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
indicated...
the
court's
review
of
the
cases
in
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
a
rebuttable
presumption
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
all
right.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
understood
that,
justice
scalia.
my
own
interpretation,
in
terms
of
analyzing
the
case,
was
that
if
this
court
acts
and
based
upon
syllabus
number
2,
if
this
court
would,
for
example,
determine
the
ohio
court
was
in
error
under
the
federal
constitution,
the
result
under
the
ohio
constitution
would
not
change,
and
this
court's
opinion
would
be
in
advisory
in
nature--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--with
regard
to
that
state
ground.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
there
are
no
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
that
i
have
located
that
predicate
its
decision
solely
upon
the
ohio
case
law.
looking
at
the
merits
of
the
case,
obviously
the
issues
that
the
supreme
court
confronted
were
significant
in
terms
of
its
citizens
in
ohio,
and
the
backdrop
of
the
case
is
extremely
important,
because
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
district,
that
reviewed
this
case
initially,
indicated
that
it
was
adopting
its
holding
and
its
opinion
in
state
v.
rutherford,
which
was
another
case
involving
the
same
deputy,
and
what
the
ohio
court
was
confronted
with,
and
what
gave
rise
to
this
significant
issue,
was
that
the
officer
in
that
case,
deputy
newsome,
who
is
the
same
officer
in
this
case,
indicated
that
in
the
year
mr.
robinette
was
stopped
he
had
obtained
consent
searches
in
786
cases.
that's
one
officer
in
one
county
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
what
it
does
raise,
however,
are
two
significant
points
which
the
supreme
court
was
concerned
about.
that's
one
officer
in
one
county,
which
certainly
could
indicate
that
this
same
practice
is
affecting
ohio
citizens
and
other
citizens--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--i'm
sorry,
your...
mr.
chief--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--that
was
montgomery
county,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
dayton,
ohio.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
so
the
court
was
concerned
that
this
may
literally
be
involving
thousands
of
motorists.
secondly,
the
fact
that
the
officer
indicated
that
in
all
cases
in
which
he
sought
a
search,
he
got
consent
to
search,
would
simply
indicate
to
the
court
in
its
facing
the
problem
that
perhaps
motorists
do
not
realize
that
they
do
not
have
the
liberty
of
refusing
consent
to
search,
so
it
is
significant
data,
and
there
is
very
little
other
data
that's
available,
no
record
to
tell
us
how
many
innocent
citizens
are
stopped,
are
subjected
to
search,
and
how
that
impacts
not
only
citizens
of
ohio
but
citizens
of
other
states.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
no
question
that
he
violated
the
statute
and
the
stop
was
appropriate.
what
is
important
when
the
court
looked
at
this
case
is
that
it
is
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
deputy
had
indicated
that
he
in
fact
had
determined
in
his
own
mind
that
he
was
going
to
give
a
warning
and
nothing
more,
and
he
made
that
determination
after
he
obtained
the
driver's
license
and
before
he
ever
removed
mr.
robinette
from
the
vehicle.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
what
the
officer
could
do
would
be
an
objective
determination.
what
the
facts
are
in
this
case,
which
the
supreme
court
is
looking
at
to
make
its
judgment
on,
is
subjective
in
nature.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
would
agree
that
the
subjective
fact
itself
is
not
dispositive
of
the
broader
issue.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
would
believe
that
under
the
ohio
court
opinion
that
they
did
not
discard
the
totality
of
circumstances,
because
the
court--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--i
think
that
the
totality
of
circumstances
rule
is
fine
in
search
and
seizure
cases.
this
court's...
the
ohio
court's
opinion
did
not
intend,
nor
does
it
suggest
that
it's
going
to
supplant
that.
the
ohio--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--well,
as
this
court
said,
justice
o'connor,
in
florida
v.
royer,
in
that
opinion
the
court
addressed
one
of
the
issues
in
regard
to
that
was
an
unlawful
detention,
and
therefore
any
consent
obtained
was
invalid,
but
the
court
indicated
in
that
opinion
very
similar
to
what
the
ohio
court
rationalized,
and
that
is
that
all
that
would
have
been
necessary
for
the
officer
to
do
is
return
the
driver's
license
and
the
ticket,
and
advise
mr.
royer
that
he
was
free
to
go.
that
is
in
the
language
of
the--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--i
would
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
certainly
was,
and...
but
what
the
court
has
recognized
here
in
light
of
the
facts
of
this
case
and
what's
developed
is,
how
does
the
citizen
truly
know
when
he
can
or
cannot
leave,
when
he
can
walk
away,
because
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstance
is
an
analysis
of
what
is
the
citizen
confirming,
what
is
the
officer
doing,
what
is
the
citizen,
or
the
motorist
standing
there,
what
understanding
did
he
have
of
what
is
transpiring,
and
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
looks
at
is,
attempting
to
provide
at
least
some
very
minimal
protection
to
the
motorist
who's
confronted
with
the
situation.
because
it
is
true
that
until
the
officer
tells
the
motorist
that
he
can
leave,
the
average
person
would
certainly
not
feel
free
to
depart
if
the
officer
continues
his
discussion
with
him.
he's
inquiring
about
where
you've
been
and
where
you're
going,
and
who's
with
you
and--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--the
average
person
does
not
feel
free--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--while
the
officer--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
yes,
justice
stevens.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
did
not
refer
to
any
per
se
rule
at
all.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
from
the
ohio
supreme
court,
or
this
court?
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
my
understanding
of
this
court's
opinion
in
arnell
is
that
that
review
would
be
de
novo.
it
certainly
would
be
considered
by
the
court,
but
the
court
is
not...
it's
not
necessary
to
give
deference
to
the--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--in
my
view
the
decention
was
unlawful,
and
the
supreme
court
very
precisely
analyzed
that
issue.
the
court
pointed
out
that
when
newscme
returned
to
robinette's
vehicle,
at...
all
aspects
of
the
traffic
stop
had
been
concluded.
he
had
checked
the
license,
it
was
valid,
the
registration
was
okay,
he
had
already
determined
he
was
going
to
issue
a
warning,
so
he
then
went
back,
and
the
only
reason,
according
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
deputy
newsome,
for
removing
robinette
from
his
vehicle
was
for
the
purpose
of
placing
him
in
front
of
the
cruiser
so
that
he
could
begin...
then
begin
the--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--he
had
not
issued
the
warning.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
have
no
evidence
of
that,
your
honor.
that
is
an
issue
that
obviously
comes
to
mind,
because
the
citizen--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--it
is...
there
isn't...
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
import
of
justice
scalia's
question.
it
is
true
that
the
record
indicates
that
the
first
thing
that
happened
was,
he
was
asked,
did
you
feel
at
the
time
that
the
officer
gave
you
your
license
you
were
free
to
go?
he
said
yes,
but
the
immediate
conversation
after
that
took
place,
and
his
response
was
that
he
was
shocked
when
he
was
asked
about
drugs,
or
about,
are
you
carrying
any
illegal
contraband.
then
the
followup
question
to
that
was,
do
you
mind
if
i
searched?
he
testified
that
he
was
shocked,
and
felt
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--he
did
not
indicate
why
he
said
that
he
was
shocked,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
simply
indicated
he
was
shocked
when
confronted
with
that
question.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
perhaps
he
didn't
remember
that
he
had
a
half
a
pill
there.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it's
just
a
very
narrow
decision
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
the
detention
was
unlawful,
and
any
consent
he
had
given
was
invalid
as
a
result
of
the
unlawful
detention.
in
fact--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
the
appellate
court,
i
don't
think
it's
clear.
it
was...
the
tape
was
in
the
record.
i
do
not
specifically
recall
whether
any
specific
comments
that
would
indicate
that
they
did
look
at
the
tape.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
think
that
may
provide
some
added
assistance
in
reviewing
the
opinion
for
those
judges
who
do.
however,
in
the
trial
court's
decision,
the
trial
court
never
approached
the
issue
of
whether
this
was
an
unlawful
detention.
that
issue
was
not
discussed
by
the
trial
judge.
justice...
i
think
it
was
justice
ginsburg
that
had
asked
earlier
concerning
the
first
syllabus
in
this
case.
syllabus
number
1
that
appears
in
this
case,
neither
the
state
nor
the
government
in
its
brief
or
in
argument
have
contested
syllabus
number
1
which
is
before
the
court,
which
clearly
finds
that
there
was
an
unlawful
detention,
and
that
any
consent
that
was
obtained
from
mr.
robinette
as
a
result
of
that
unlawful
detention
cannot
be
upheld,
since
it
is
the
product
of
that
illegal
detention.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
think
the
only...
i'm
content
with
the
issue
as
framed
by
the
justice.
however,
it
is
clear
that,
at
least
in
my
understanding
of
both
federal
and
ohio
law,
that
the
syllabus,
syllabus
number
1
that
directs
itself
to
the
unlawful
detention,
is
in
compliance
with
federal
law.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
no.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that.
the...
syllabus
number
1
clearly
rests
upon
the
facts,
as
the
high
supreme
court
set
forth
in
its
opinion.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
it
was
based
upon
the
terry
analysis
that
the
initial
intrusion
that
was
justified
in
the
first
instance
had
been...
that
there
were
no
additional
facts
that
expanded
the
scope
of
the
basis
for
the
original
detention,
and
therefore
the
officer
was...
had
exceeded
permissible
search
as
a
result
of
that.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
i
think
one
of
the
facts
the
supreme
court
looked
at
was
the
time.
that
is,
the
time
relationship
between
when
the
initial
stop
occurred
and
when
the
officer
had
completed
his,
and
the
subsequent
events.
the
court
also
looked
to
the
question
of
whether
there
were
any
intervening
circumstances
that
impacted
upon
the
officer's
conduct,
and
finally
looked
at
the
conduct
of
the
officer
in
terms
of
whether
what
were
his
specific
actions,
and
was
it
flagrant
and
purposeful,
and
basically
the
analysis
seemed
to
parallel
this
court's
analysis
in
the
royer
case
in
viewing
the
conduct
that
was
involved,
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
specifically
addressed
the
fact
that
once
the
officer
had
determined
that
in
his
mind
all
of
the
circumstances
relating
to
the
original
purpose
of
the
stop
were
completed,
then
one
could
not
justify
the
subsequent
actions
that
occurred.
it
is
basically
respondent's
position
that
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
attempted
to
do
in
reviewing
the
facts
of
this
case
was
to
provide
some
minimal
protection
that
is
available
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that's
all
they
were
trying
to
do.
the
court
does
not--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--after
he
removed
him
from
the
car
and
placed
him
in
front
of
the
cruiser,
the
officer
then
went
to
his
cruiser,
turned
on
the
video,
returned
back,
and
then
as
he
began
talk
to
him,
he
handed
his
license--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--after
he
had
started
questioning--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--right.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
right.
that
was
the
view
of
the
dissent,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
and--
mr.
james
d.
ruppert
--still...
there
still
arises
the
issue
of
the
officer's
conduct
behind
that,
and
one
of
the
things
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
concerned
about
was
the
fact
that
while
that
is
transpiring,
that
one
follows
the
other.
there
is
no
interval.
the
officer
didn't
stop
talking.
he
hands
him
his
license,
and
he's
talking
about,
we've
had
some
traffic
accidents,
and...
but
let
me...
before
you
get
going
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
and
then
the
subsequent
sequence
of
events
occurred.
it
is
respondent's
position
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
the
analysis
that
was
entertained
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
an
appropriate
one.
it
certainly
is
consistent
with
the
authority
of
this
court
on...
under
fourth
amendment
cases,
and
we
would
urge
affirmance
of
the
supreme
court's
decision.
