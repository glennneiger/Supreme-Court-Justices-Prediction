justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
ingram--
--what
do
you
base
your
answer
on,
then?
i...
what
do
you
base
your
answer
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
do
you
mind
telling
me,
at
the
traffic
stop,
did
the
officer
order
robinette
to
get
out
of
the
car
before
he
checked
the
driver's
license,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
was
robinette
still
detained
here,
after
the
warning
was
issued?
he
was
not
free
to
go?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
contradicts
what
you've
been
saying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
mr.
ruppert,
as
i
recall,
the
ohio
supreme
court
appeared
to
be
interpreting
federal
law
here,
and
cited
a
number
of
federal
cases,
and
in
general
ohio
has
followed
the
federal
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
isn't
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
no
question
that
ohio
could
adopt
this
per
se
rule
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law
if
it
wants
to,
but
unless
it's
clear
from
the
face
of
the
opinion
that
it
has
rejected
the
federal
rule
and
is
adopting
something
as
a
matter
of
state
law
only,
under
michigan
v.
long
we
assume
that
it's
interwoven
with
federal
law
and
we
have
jurisdiction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
your
position
would
require
us
to
reject
or
overturn
michigan
v.
long.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
and
also,
in
cases
where
we've
been
trying
to
determine
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
at
what
point
a
seizure
occurs,
have
we
not
looked
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
shouldn't
the
converse
be
true
when
we're
looking
to
determine
when
a
seizure
has
ended?
why
wouldn't
we
look
again
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that's
the
proper
rule,
then,
look
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
looks
like
it
to
me,
as
i
read
paragraph
2
of
the
syllabus,
accompanied
by
the
opinion.
they
appear
to
have
engrafted
on
it
a
per
se
rule
in
determining
when
a
seizure
ends,
that
you
have
to
have
a
warning.
now,
i
thought
in
general
we
would
look
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
now,
maybe
we
would
end
up
with
the
same
result
here.
i
don't
know.
nobody
applied
that
test.
