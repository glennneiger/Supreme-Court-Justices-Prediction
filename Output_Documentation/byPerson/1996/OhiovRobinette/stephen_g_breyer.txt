justice
stephen

breyer
--the
trial
judge
looked
at
the
tape
and
reached
a
conclusion
in
part
on
the
basis
of
the
tape.
is
there
anything
that
suggests
whether
or
not
the
two
appellate
courts
looked
at
the
tape?
i
couldn't
find
anything
in
the
opinion
that
said
that
they
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
i'm
wondering
if
there's
some
deference
due.
the
tapes
are
awfully
good
checks
against
serious
police
abuse,
very
good
checks.
is
there
any
sense
in
deferring
more
to
those
judges
who
use
them
than
those
who
don't?
