justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
another
nuts
and
bolts
question.
when
he
decides
to
give
a
warning,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
does
he
present
the
motorist
with
a
document,
a
piece
of
paper
that
says,
"warning"?
do
they
record
these
warnings,
or
is
it
customarily,
and
was
it
in
this
case,
just
an
oral
statement
saying,
i
warn
you
not
to
do
it
again?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
he
had
given
him
a
statement
which
said,
in
effect,
on
its
face
that
it
was
a
warning
before
he
began
the
conversation
about
whether
there
was
anything
improper
in
the
car?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
agree
that
the
criterion
for
deciding
what
he
could
and
couldn't
do,
what
was
lawful,
what
was
unlawful,
was
not
his
subjective
determination,
but
an
objective
assessment
of
the
facts.
you
agree
with
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
subjective
fact
is
not
dispositive.
you
agree
with
that,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
there
was
a
fact
in
the
record.
i
thought
he
testified
that
in
fact
he
did
not
feel
that
he
could
refuse
the
request
for
the
search.
isn't
that
a
relevant
fact?
