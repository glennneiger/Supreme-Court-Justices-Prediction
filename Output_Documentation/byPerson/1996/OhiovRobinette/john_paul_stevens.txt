justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
suggest
that
your
answer
about
whether
he
could
have
changed
his
mind
and
all
is
based
on
the
common
sense
notion
that
as
long
as
the
two
people
are
standing
there
together,
the
officer
retains
control
of
the
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
ask
two
questions.
first,
this
is
different
from
mimms,
because
mimms
was
a
lawful
detention.
he
got
out...
ordered
him
out
of
the
car
during
a
lawful
detention.
here,
as
i
understand
the
first
paragraph
of
the
syllabus,
it
was
an
unlawful
detention
after
the
purpose
of...
purpose
of
the
custody
had
terminated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
put
the
second
question.
do
you
just
take
issue
with
the
first
paragraph
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
syllabus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
agree
that's
a
correct
statement
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
not
true
that
we
could
answer
the
question
presented
in
the
certiorari
petition
in
your
favor
and
still
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of...
of
the
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
we
disagree
with
that
holding,
is
it
nevertheless
true
that
we
might
affirm
the
judgment
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
is
it
legal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
appears
in
the
opinion
after
it
had
made
the
other
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
recollection
of
the
mimms
rationale
for
saying
the
officer
had
that
authority?
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
giving
warnings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
was
officer
safety
implicated
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
when
the
officer
just
wants
to
give
the
guy
a
lecture?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what's
involved
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
under
that
test,
is
his
testimony
he
thought
he
was
free
to
leave
therefore
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
subjective
motivation
is
relevant,
but
the
officer's
subjective
motivation
is
not
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
similarly,
then,
is
what
this
particular
officer
thought
of
some
relevance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
controlling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
one
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
ruppert?
justice
john
paul
stevens
refresh
my
recollection.
did
the
court
of
appeals,
the
intermediate
court
in
ohio,
did
thev
decide
that
the
detention
continued
without
relying
on
any
per
se
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that...
is
that
holding
entitled
to
any
deference,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
a
federal
court
reviewing
the
results
of
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
other
question
i
had,
in
your
view
that
you...
i
know
you
argue
the
detention
continued
during
the
interrogation.
in
your
view,
was
that
detention
lawful
or
unlawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
i
want
to
be
sure
about
some
facts.
when
exactly
did
the
officer
give
him
back
the
driver's
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
he
had
started
questioning
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
dissenters
on
the
court
will
say
that
that's
the
moment
when
he
gave
him
the
driver's
license,
that's
when
the
detention
ended.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
ordering
him
out
of
the
car
was
part
of
the
detention,
and
the
first
few
questions
were
part
of
the
detention,
or
at
least...
i
don't
know,
just
the
first
question
or
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
that's
the
state's
view
here,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
that
you
think
the
detention
ended
when
the
officer
gave
him
the
driver's
license
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
continued
up
until
then?
