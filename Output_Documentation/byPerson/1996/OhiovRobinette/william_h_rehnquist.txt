chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-891,
ohio
v.
robert
d.
robinette.
mr.
ingram.
oh,
pardon
me.
ms.
ingram.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
decisional
law
or
administrative
rulings
in
ohio
to
support
what
you
just
say,
or
are
you
kind
of
going
by,
you
know,
what
you
think
is
probably
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
idea
that
he...
the
patrolman
has
given
the
respondent,
here,
a
warning.
the
respondent
gives
the
patrolman
some
indication
that
he
has
contempt
for
the
law
or
something
like
that,
or
something
causes
the
patrolman
to
change
his
mind.
has
that
ever
come
up
in
any
litigated
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
the...
in
ohio
isn't
it
the
case
that
if
there's
thought
to
be
ambiguity
in
the
syllabus
you
can
turn
to
the
opinion
to
interpret
one...
to
give
one
or
another
meeting
to
a
syllabus
paragraph?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
has
to
be
performed
somewhere,
either
in
this
court
or
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
ingram.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
gornstein?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
wren
would
say
even
if
he
doesn't
himself
subjectively
take
into
account
his
safety,
if
that
is
an
objective
reason,
that's
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
ruppert,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
ruppert,
in
michigan
v.
long
we
talked
about
opinions
of
state
courts,
not
syllabi,
and
although
ohio
may
have
a
special
rule
as
to
the
holding
of
its
court,
i
think
michigan
v.
long
would
require
us
to
look
at
the
opinion
rather
than
just
the
syllabus
to
decide
whether
the
michigan
v.
long
test
is
satisfied.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
county
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
county
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
fellow
certainly
wasn't
innocent.
he
was
driving
69
miles
an
hour
in
a
45-mile-an-hour
zone,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
difference
between
the
royer
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
opinion
here,
is
the
supreme
court
opinion
says
in
so
many
words
we're
laying
down
a
per
se
rule,
regardless
of
the
circumstances,
and
royer
was
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
say
why
he
was
shocked,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
did
have
drugs
in
the
car?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ruppert.
ms.
ingram,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
ingram.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
