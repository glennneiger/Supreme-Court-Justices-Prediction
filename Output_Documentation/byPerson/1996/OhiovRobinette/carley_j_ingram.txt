ms.
carley
j.
ingram
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
traffic
stop,
a
driver's
consent
to
search,
and
the
discovery
of
drugs
in
his
car.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
police
officer
to
warn
a
motorist
at
the
end
of
a
traffic
stop
that
he's
free
to
go,
and
that
if
the
officer
fails
to
give
that
warning,
any
cooperation
by
the
motorist
from
that
point
on
must
be
presumed
to
be
involuntary.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
your
honor,
there
is
a
statute
that...
if
it
is
a
traffic
stop,
the
officer
may
simply
cite
the
motorist
if
he
has
proof
of
identification,
which
doesn't
have
to
be
a
driver's
license.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
he
may
cite
or
warn
at
his
discretion.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
yes,
he
does.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
he
could
change
is
mind,
certainly,
and
give
the
ticket.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
and
the
question
would
then
become
whether
or
not
the
officer's
decision
to
change
his
mind
when
he
told
the
person
he
wasn't
going
to
give
him
the
ticket
and
then
decided
to
give
the
ticket
would
have
an
effect
on
whether
or
not
the
person
felt
then
that
he
was
free
to
leave,
or
he
was
being
coerced
in
some--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--yes,
the
officer
could
do
that.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
right,
that's
correct,
until
the
ticket
is
written
or
the
warning
is
given,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
your
honor,
it
can
be
done
both
ways.
in
this
case,
on
reference
to
the
video
tape
will
show
that
the
officer
handed
the...
he
handed
robinette
a
written
warning.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
yes,
your
honor,
and
he
had
also
returned
his
driver's
license
to
him--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--at
that
point.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
if
he
had
told...
if
he
had
told...
if...
it
would
have
been
very
difficult,
then,
for
the
officer
to
justify,
without
anything
further
happening,
giving
him
a
ticket
on
just
his
change
of
mind,
but--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--the
question--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--after
he's
given
him
the
warning
i
think
it
would
be
more
difficult,
but
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
validity
of
what
he
did
on
that
would
affect
whether
or
not
the
speeding
ticket,
whether
or
not
that
was...
whether
or
not
the
validity
of
the
speeding
ticket
was
upheld,
not
whether
or
not...
it
would
simply
be
a
factor
to
be
considered
when
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
was
detained
or
whether--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--he
had
the
right...
if
the
motorist
did
nothing
further
but
give
the
officer
a
flippant
answer,
then
the
business
of
the
stop
is
over,
the
officer
has
made
his
decision
to
give
a
warning,
the
officer's
discretion
is
still
controlling
it,
and
under
ohio
law,
there's
nothing
that
would
prevent
the
officer
at
that
point
from
issuing
him
the
ticket.
the
officer
has
that
kind
of
discretion.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
in
this
case
it
was,
your
honor.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
yes,
i--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
yes.
you
could
void
out
the
written
warning--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--to
the
extent
it's
entered,
and
then
issue
a
ticket.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
to
support
the...
to
support
that
the
officer
can--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--i
cannot
cite
you
a
case.
i
cannot
cite
you
a
case,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
hasn't
come
up.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
on
consideration
of
fourth
amendment
principles
that
until...
the
officer
has
the
right
to
detain
a
speeding
motorist
until
he
completes
the
business
of
the
traffic
stop,
and
his
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
issue
a
ticket
or
a
warning,
and
the
final
issuance
of
a
ticket
even
if
he's
already
issued
a
warning
is
part
of
the
business
of
a
traffic
stop,
so
whether
or
not--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--a
policeman
has
the
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
warn
or
cite,
yes,
your
honor,
and...
and
the
fact...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
because
a
warning
is
not
a
final
order.
it's
not...
it's
not
a
final
order.
it's...
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
warning,
he's
giving
the
person
a
break,
he's
doing
something
he
doesn't
have
to
do.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
it
just
was
the
warning,
and
then
the
question
of,
are
you
carrying
any
illegal
drugs
or
contraband.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
your
honor,
he
checked
the
driver's
license,
then
ordered
him
out
of
the
car,
then
returned
the
driver's
license
and
gave
him
a
lecture
on
speeding.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
this
was
also
captured
on
video
tape
from
the
time
of
the...
from
the
time
he
gave
him
the
lecture
on
speeding
and
gave
him
his
license
back,
so
an
interesting
fact
about
this
case
is
that
there's
no
real
dispute
about
what
happened
between
robinette
and
the
officer
during
that
actual
encounter.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
that's
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
what
the
ohio--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--unless
the--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--and--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--if
the
officer...
if
the
officer
gives
him
the
final
ticket,
and
that
is
the
last
thing
that
has
to
do
with
the
business
of
the
traffic
stop,
and
nothing
further
has
happened
to
give
the
officer
any
more
justification
to
hold
him,
then
the
person
is
free
to
go.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
well,
that's
correct,
and
the
question,
if
the
person--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--if
all
he's
been
issued
is
a
warning,
and
the
officer
is
still
acting
in
such
a
way
to
cause
this
person
to
believe
that
his
continued
presence
is
required,
that
he
can't
leave,
then
he
is
detained.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
he
was
free
to
go
when
the--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--he
was...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
he
was
free
to
go
in
this
case
when
the
warning
was
issued,
and
when
the
police
officer
gave
him
back
his
driver's
license.
in
fact,
at
the
suppression
hearing
he
testified
that
at
that
point,
when
the
officer
then
asked
him,
did
you
believe
you
were
free
to
go
at
that
point,
he
said
yes,
i
did,
and
he
answered
that
way
twice
under
exam/cross-examination,
so
not
only
is
their
objective,
from
looking
at
the
video
tape
evidence,
that
the
officer
did
nothing
coercive,
this
person
himself
testified
that
he
believed
at
that
point
he
was
free
to
go.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
your
honor,
that's
an
accurate
statement
of
the
text
of
the
opinion.
however,
in
ohio--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--no,
your
honor,
it
isn't.
the
first
syllabus
depends
on
the
resolution
of
the
question
of
what
is
continued
detention,
and
if
this
court...
and
is
based
and
relies
on
the
court's
holding
that
unless
these
words
are
spoken,
detention
will
be
presumed,
so
if
this
court
were
to
rule
in
my
favor--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--your
honor,
the
first...
the
first
syllabus
is,
i
would
submit
is
an
accurate
statement
of
the
law.
however,
the...
and
to
the
extent
that
you're
looking
to
the
text
of
the
opinion,
i
would
say
that
in
ohio
the
syllabus
states
the
holding
of
the
court
on
the
facts
arising
from
the
case.
that's
the
holding
of
the
court.
what
is
in
the
opinion
is
simply
the
opinion
of
the
writer
or
the
author
of
the
opinion.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
no,
your
honor,
because
point
1
is
necessarily
included
in
point
2.
point
1
talks
about
continued
detention,
and
in
order
to
determine
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
talking
about
under
the
fourth
amendment
when
they
talk
about
continued
detention,
you
look
to
point
2
and
see
that
there's
continued
detention.
we're
going
to
presume
that
further
cooperation
is
voluntary
if
the
officer
has
not
given
this
warning,
so
when
that...
when
you
understand
what...
when
it's
clear
what
they're
talking
about
in
regard
to
the
second
for
detention--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--but
your
honor,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
several
cases,
while
the...
the
opinion
itself
is
simply
dicta,
because
the
text
of
the
syllabus
is
what
the
court
holds
is
the
law
of
the
case,
and
that
what
is
contained
in
the
opinion
is
simply
the...
must
be
viewed
simply
as
the
view
of
the
author
of
the
opinion.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
my
position
is,
is
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
syllabus
1,
because
it's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
your
honor,
once
again
i'd
ask
you
to
look
at
the
language
of
the
continued
detention,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
understand
that
separately
from
the
definition,
or
the
presumption
of
detention
and
lack
of
cooperation
given
in
the
second.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
against
me...
i'm
sorry,
hold
for
me
on
the
second
proposition
of
law,
and
remand
the
case
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
with
instructions
to
decide
the
case
using
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
then
using
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
and
in
view
of
the
first
syllabus,
i
would
either
win
the
case
or
lose
the
case,
but
i
would
lose
it
on
the
right
standard.
they
would
be
saying,
here's
how
we
decide
when
detention
occurs.
we're
not
thinking
about
continued
detention
because
of
a
failure
of
warning.
we're
going
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
a
court
could
either--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--your
honor,
that's...
the
court
was
wrong
in
that
that
violates
pennsylvania
v.
mimms
and
this
court's
decision
in
wren
v.
united
states,
but
the
ohio
supreme
court...
and
additionally
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
always
held
that
the
protections
afforded
by
it
search
and
seizure
provision
are
the
same
as
afforded
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
fact,
it
held
that
back
in
march
1966
in
a
case
called
state
ex
rel--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--but
your
honor,
at
that
point
when
he
ordered
him
out
of
the
car
he
hadn't
even...
he
hadn't
even
talked
to
him
about
speeding
and
he
hadn't
given
him
the
lecture.
the
ohio
supreme
court
also
has
determined
that
the
officer's
subjective...
in
line
with
this
court's
decision
in
wren
v.
united
states
has
also
held
that
the
officer's
subjective
state
of
mind
doesn't
enter
into
a
reasonableness
determination.
the--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--no,
i
do
not.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
it's
a
correct
statement
of
law,
but
i
don't
believe...
but
i
do
not
believe
that
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
me
on
the
second,
or
disagree
with,
that
that
would
not...
that
that
would
determine
the
outcome
of
the
case,
or
that
i
would
still
lose
in
ohio.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
i
would
say
you
could
do
that
if
you
would...
if
you
would
affirm...
resolve
the
second...
the
question
presented
in
my
favor,
do
a...
perform
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis,
and
conclude
that
the
detention
was
lawful
and
that
the
consent
was
voluntary.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
should
the
court...
should
the
court
advise
the
ohio
supreme
court
or
reverse
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
hold
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
is
appropriate,
whether
there's
a
bright
line
rule,
then
if
this
court
were
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
or
to
remand,
i
would
either...
i...
the
evidence
would
be
such
that
even
under...
it
would
offer
an
explanation
of
what
continued
detention
means
under
the
first
syllabus
and
a
review
of
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
would
indicate
that,
in
this
case,
where
he
admitted
that
he
knew
he
was
free
to
go
and
that
video
tape
reveals
no
coercion,
that
this
person
was
not
detained
and
consented
voluntarily.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
state's
position
is
that
there's
nothing
so
peculiar
about
a
traffic
stop
that
requires
the
imposition
of
a
bright
line
threshold,
and
this
is
a
threshold,
not
a
test.
it's
a
burden
without
a
benefit,
because
once
that
threshold
is
met
of
showing
that
these
warnings
were
given,
the
analysis
must
proceed
to
whether
or
not,
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
there
was
a
detention
and
consent
was
voluntary,
so
while
it
imposes
the
burdens
of
a
bright
line
test,
it
doesn't
afford
the
benefit
of
clarity
or
certainty
that
bright
line
tests
normally--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--yes.
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
yes,
and
it
was
lawful,
lawfully
continued
until
then.
for
these
reasons,
i'd
ask
the
court
to--
ms.
carley
j.
ingram
--reject...
thank
you.
