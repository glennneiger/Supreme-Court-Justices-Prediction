justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
he--
--can
we
go
back
a
little
bit
in
time,
because
the
ohio
supreme
court,
which
is
the
one
thing
that
we
have
before
us,
seemed
to
say
that
the
lawful
stop
had
ended
before
the
officer
commanded
robinette
to
get
out
of
the
car.
under
the
ohio
supreme
court's
opinion,
once
the
police
office
checked
robinette's
license,
every
aspect
of
the
speeding
violation
had
been
investigated
and
resolved.
these
are
the
words
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
hence,
the
ohio
supreme
court
concluded
that
the
detention
stopped
being
lawful
and
became
unlawful
when
the
officer
commanded
robinette
to
get
out
of
the
car.
is
that
not
an
accurate
statement
of
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
syllabus
that
counts,
and
isn't
that
an
accurate
statement
of
the
first
point
in
the
syliabus?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
second
point
in
the
syllabus.
the
first
point
says
nothing
about
the...
the
first
point
just
says
that
the
detention...
the
extension
of
the
detention
was
illegal.
there's
nothing
in
that
at
all
in
that
first
point
about
the
warning
that
you
are
legally
free
to
go.
that
doesn't
come
up
until
point
2.
the
first
point
in
the
syllabus
seems
just
to
consolidate
the
first
part
of
the
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
this
opinion
just
stopped,
the
syllabus
just
stopped
with
point
1.
the
point
2
is
not
necessary
to
the
decision.
they're
alternatives,
aren't
they?
suppose
the
decision
had
stopped
with
point
1,
then
the
second
question
is
academic,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
would
one
make
that
assumption
when
reading
the
court's
own
account
of
it?
it's
one
thing
to
say
only
the
syllabus
states
the
law,
but
another
thing
to
say
is,
we're
going
to
put
on
the
that
statement
in
the
syllabus
something
different
than
the
ohio
supreme
court's
explanation
of
the
statement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
go
on
with
the
ohio
supreme
court's
opinion,
before
they
get
to
this
business
about
a
warning
they
say,
even
assuming
newsome's
detention
of
robinette
was
legal
throughout
the
time
when
newsome
handed
back
robinette
his
driver's
license.
the
first
part
of
the
opinion
says
it
wasn't
a
legal
detention,
and
then
it
goes
on,
even
if
it
was
legal,
there
had
to
be
a
warning.
so
the
first
part
seems
to
say
the
detention,
once
the
police
officer
satisfied
himself
with
the
license
check,
was
unlawful,
period,
and
then
we
go
on
to,
but
even
if
it
was
lawful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
about
ohio's
position
that
the
continued
detention
was
after
the
license
check?
once
the
license
check
was
done
under
this
first
heading,
that
was
the
end
of
the
lawful
detention,
so
that
according
to
the
ohio
supreme
court's
explanation
of
what
that
first
paragraph
is
about,
from
the
time
the
officer
goes
back
to
the
car
and
tells
robinette
to
get
out,
the
detention
was
unlawful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
would
we
make
that
judgment?
isn't
that
a
judgment
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
seems
to
have
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gornstein,
he
didn't
order
him
out
of
the
car
for
those
purposes.
i
think
it's
conceded,
it's
not
in
controversy,
is
it,
that
he
ordered
him
out
of
the
car
so
he
could
turn
on
the
video
tape
in
the
police
officer's
car
and
have
a
video
tape
of
what
next
transpired?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
it
was
on
the
record
objective,
the
reason
that
he
had
robinette
get
out
of
the
car
was
he
wanted
to
video
tape
their
ensuing
conversation,
which
was
not
going
to
be
related
to
the
traffic
stop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
--mr.
gornstein,
do
you
know
whether
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
had
a
repeat
of
this
holding,
and
if
so,
has
it
used
the
fourth
amendment
in
addition
to
the
state
constitution?
has
there
been
another
holding
about
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--bright
line
test?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
difference
between
a
consensual
encounter,
where
the
person
has
never
been
under
detention,
and
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
detention
and
then
it's
asserted
that
the
detention
ended
and
the
rest
was
consensual?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ruppert--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you...
would
you
answer
the
question
i
asked
mr.
gornstein
any
differently?
has
there...
have
there
been
any
subsequent
decisions
in
ohio
that
place
this
warning
solely
on
the
ohio
constitution
rather
than
on
both?
