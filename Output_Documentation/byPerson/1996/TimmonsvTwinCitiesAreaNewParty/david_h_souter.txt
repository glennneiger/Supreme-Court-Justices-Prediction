what's
your
answer
to
the
suggestion
that
someone
made
here
that,
assuming
somebody
gets
confused
and
votes
twice,
all
the
state
has
to
do
is
count
it
once?
why
isn't
that
the
answer,
the
simple
answer
to
the
voter
confusion
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
they
marked...
if
joe
doaks
is
running
on
two
lines
and
they
mark
joe
doaks
on
each
line,
isn't
it
a
fair
inference
that
they
want
doaks?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
are
these
such
difficult
issues
for
the
state
to
deal
with?
why,
for
example,
can't
the
state
simply
decide
that
in
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
question
of
party
qualification
based
on
the
vote,
that
one...
that
the
major
party
will
be
deemed
to
have
preeminence,
and
the
vote
will
count
for
that
purpose,
that
a
minor
party
will
not
be
allowed
in
an
ambiguous
case
to
count
the
vote.
why
can't
the
state
come
up
with
some
kind
of
a
tie-breaker
rule
which
would
be
easier
or
less
restrictive
on
voter
choice
than
the
antifusion
rule?
justice
david

--mr.
slowes,
may
i
ask
you
a
general
question,
i
think
that
goes
to
the
weight
that
we
should
give,
or
at
least
the
weight
that
i
should
give
to
all
of
the
justifications
that
the
state
is
raising
here?
if
we
were
deciding
this
case,
i
guess
without
the
benefit
of
history,
i
could
listen
to
your
arguments
and
i
would
say,
there's
something
plausible
about
them,
and
the
people
who
write
election
laws
probably
know
a
lot
more
about
voter
behavior
than
i
do,
and
i
may
not
think
these
are
overwhelming
justifications,
perhaps.
i
mean,
they
don't
just
hit
me
that
hard,
but
i
probably
ought
to
defer
to
people
who
know
more
about
this
subject
than
i
do.
the
trouble
that
i
have
in
giving
any
kind
of
deference
that
way,
however,
is
the
history,
and
if
i
understand
the
history
correctly,
the
reason
we've
got
these
antifusion
laws
in
so
many
states
was
basically
a
very
widespread
effort
sometime
ago
simply
to
maintain
the
relative
hegemony
of
the
two
parties,
the
republicans
and
the
democrats.
they
weren't
worried
about
voter
confusion.
they
didn't
want
other
parties,
and
is
it
unfair...
do
you
think
it's
wrong
for
me
in
assessing
the
weight
that
i
should
give
to
your
justifications
to
bear
that
history
in
mind,
and
perhaps
to
be
skeptical
that
the
reasons
that
you
very
ably
give
are
really
the
reasons
that
the
legislatures
in
these
many
states
either
gave
in
the
first
place
or
maintain
to
this
day
for
keeping
their
laws
on
the
books?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
argument.
i
didn't
understand
you
to
be
putting
any
weight
on
the,
in
effect
the
preservation
of
a
major
two-party
system
as
such,
so
i
just
didn't
think...
i
mean,
justice
scalia
has
raised
a
good
point,
but
i
didn't
think
it
was
the
point
that
you
were
making.
