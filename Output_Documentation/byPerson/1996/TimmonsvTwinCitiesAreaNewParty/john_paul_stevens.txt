justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
sent
both
in
at
the
same
time?
what
would
you
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
state
interest
in
preventing
that
from
happening?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or,
indeed,
i
suppose
you
could
count
the
vote
whether
you
voted
on
one
line,
two
lines,
or
either,
or
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
be
pretty
dense
to
be
confused
on
this
one.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
not
the
preeminent
interest,
what
is
the
preeminent
interest?
if
voter
confusion
isn't
your
justification,
what
are
your
stronger
justifications?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that
bogus
minor
party
would
have
to
meet
all
the
state
statutory
requirements
for
becoming
a
party
eligible
to
get
on
the
ballot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
they
would
be
splintering
their
own
strength
by
going
out
of
the
way
to
create
another
party,
wouldn't
they,
and
has
this
ever
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
saying
a
major
party
would
do
that
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
put
another
question
to
you
that...
what
concerns
me
in
the
background?
i
remember
when
general
eisenhower
ran
for
president
there
was
a
real
possibility
both
major
parties
might
have
nominated
him,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
each
of
those
parties
would
have
had
a
strong
associational
interest
in
picking
the
nominee
of
its
choice.
now,
why
is
it
that
they
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
both
nominate
general
eisenhower
if
they
wanted
to?
what
is
the
powerful
interest
that
would
prevent
each
party
from
picking
its
own
nominee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
can't
select
the
one
it
wants
and
also
get
it
on
the
ballot.
i
understand.
of
course,
you
can
say
you
can
nominate
anybody
but
you
can't
have
your
nominee's
name
appear
on
the
ballot.
that's
all.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
had
a
quite
different
justification,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
justification's
strong
enough,
i
don't
know
why
they
couldn't
exclude
third
parties
altogether.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
logical
position
to
take,
but
the
court
has
said
you
can't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
maybe
that
line
of
cases
is
just
wrong.
