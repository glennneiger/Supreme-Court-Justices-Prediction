yes,
but
are
we
supposed
to
erase
from
our
mind
that
there
is
at
least
one
state
that
has
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
fusion
candidates,
and
there's
no
large
confusion.
it's
not
a
major
problem.
so
whatever
one
might
speculate
about
the
lack
of
intelligence
of
the
voters,
we
do
have
the
state
of
new
york,
where
this
has
gone
on
without
huge
confusion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
with
respect
to
voter
confusion
if
that
is
not
offset
by
voter
information?
that
is,
it's
one
thing
to
have
a
candidate
only
on
the
line
of
major
party.
it's
quite
another
thing
to
have
that
same
candidate
on
the
line
of
minor
party
that
has
certain
goals
and
objectives.
so
when
the
public
sees
someone
not
only
in
the
line
of
major
party
but
also
of
minor
party,
whether
it's
to
the
left
or
right
of
the
political
spectrum,
that
is
telling
the
voters
more
about
that
candidate,
so
isn't...
is
that
irrelevant,
that
informing
function
of
being,
say,
on
the
liberal
party
line
or
on
the
conservative
party
line
in
the
state
of
new
york,
to
take
that
as
an
example?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
for
a
limited
amount
of
time.
i
remember
you
had
to...
when
you
change,
disaffiliate
from
one,
it's
a
waiting
period.
it's
a
time
period,
the
disqualification.
you
can
become
qualified
again.
this
is
a
rule
that
operates
forever,
no
more
than
one
party
per
candidate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
the
answer
to
that,
or
at
least
part
of
the
way
to
an
answer,
that
the
major
party
consents
to
this,
so
you
don't
have
the
factionalism
that
you
have
when...
in
the...
what
has
been
called
the
sore
loser
statute
that
was
involved
in
storer.
here,
if
the
major
party
says
no
go,
then
there's
nothing...
nothing
the
minor
party
can
do.

we've

justice

mr.
tribe--
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
tribe,
what
about
judges--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
done...
with
respect
to
judges,
is
the
states
that
generally
have
no
fusion,
it's
not
uncommon
to
have
the
same
good
judge
the
choice
of
two,
maybe
three
parties.
do
you
know
how
that
works
in
states
that
have
general
no
fusion
laws?
