well,

i
take

the
argument--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
the
respondent's
argument
would
address
a
statewide
election
if
the
respondent
prevails,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
there
would
be
a
problem
with
determining
the
amount
of
votes
garnered
for
each
party,
or
a
potential
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
interested
in
justice
stevens'
question.
where
we
are
so
far
is,
it
was
suggested
first
by
justice
scalia
that
it
might
be
important
for
the
state
to
determine
which
party
garners
the
most
votes,
and
then
you
were
asked
a
question,
well,
couldn't
we
presume
that
the
preemininent
party
gets
the
votes.
i
very
much
doubt
that
minor
parties
would
agree
with
such
a
presumption.
and
then
you
said,
well,
that's
not
really
our
interest.
that's
a
side
thing.
we're
talking
about,
really,
the
whole
election
dynamic.
and
then
justice
stevens
said,
well,
what
is
your
particular
interest,
and
i
never
did
get
the
answer
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you've
had
a
number
of
questions,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
no
sore
loser
at
the
beginning
of
the
primary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
unless
you
have
that,
a
large
part
of
your
argument
vanishes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
that's
the
whole
point
of
allowing
each
party
to
have
a
specific
issue.
that's
completely
lost
if
you
aggregate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
tribe,
in
california,
some
ballots
have
over
200
items
to
mark.
if
you
had
a
state
like
minnesota,
or
a
system
like
minnesota
where
only
500
people
are
required
to
petition
for
a
party,
i
think
there
is
a
very,
very
real
danger
of
confusion
which
just
could
bog
the
process
down
completely.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'll
check
the
history,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
in
those
times
they
did
not
have
initiative,
they
did
not
have
referendum,
they
did
not
have
the
ability
of
many
citizens
to
make
arguments
directly
to
the
public
via
television
and
radio.
