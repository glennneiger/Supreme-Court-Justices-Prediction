mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
don't
think
this
case
is
about
political
engineering.
i
suppose
if
we
really
had
a
case
in
which
it
was
demonstrated
that
we
would
become
italy
or
fourth
republic
france
unless
we
compromise
the
first
amendment
we
would
have
a
very
much
more
apocalyptic
picture,
but
i
think
what's
interesting
is
that
in
the
argument
that
you
heard
this
morning
you
didn't
hear
very
much
about
what
the
state's
brief
says
are
the
real
reasons.
i
think
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
if
confusion
isn't
that
big
a
problem...
and
it
doesn't
seem
new
yorkers
are
all
that
confused
and,
with
respect,
i
guess
they're
not
that
much
smarter
than
minnesotans...
if
confusion
isn't
the
problem--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
that
may
be.
that
may
be.
either--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--just
because--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
minnesotans
might
like
things
to
be
more
orderly.
what
their
brief
does
is
talk
about
all
kinds
of
somewhat
fuzzier
values,
values,
values,
they
say,
that
are
really
more
important
than
the
literal
rights
of
association
and
speech
in
the
first
amendment.
they're
basically
saying...
and
they
say
it
in
their
brief
at
pages
9,
12,
14,
16
to
18,
24,
44.
the
repeated
theme
is
that
even
if
the
ban
on
consensual
fusion
literally
abridges
the
right
of
people
to
get
together
in
a
party
and
pick
their
standard
bearer
and
get
him
on
the
ballot
even
if
he's
already
on
the
ballot,
and
even
if
that's
one
of
the
rights
that
you
would
normally
have
under
the
first
amendment,
we
have
to
ask
whether
protecting
those
rights
here
would,
in
their
language,
serve
first
amendment
values,
and
they
say
it
wouldn't,
because...
here
again
i
quote
from
their
brief...
it
really
wouldn't
enrich
political
discussion
with
different
ideas
unless
new
parties,
and
i
quote,
presented
candidates
overlooked
by
the
major
parties.
in
other
words,
new
faces.
that's
what
third
parties
are
good
for,
the
subtext
being
that
the
major
parties
really
have
covered
the
ideological
waterfront
between
them,
and
unless
you're
ready
to
come
up
with
a
new
face...
if
it's
just
dwight
eisenhower,
or
earl
warren,
or
here...
not
to
put
him
in
the
same
company...
andy
dawkins
all
over
again,
then
what
else
is
new?
we
really
think
that
we
should
orchestrate
the
consensual
alliances
of
citizens
in
political
association
in
such
a
way
as
to
move
things
away
from...
and
again,
their
brief
complains
about
single
issue
campaigns.
they
say
there
would
be
a
tendency,
and
again
i
guess
i
heard
this
again
in
the
argument
this
morning,
a
tendency
to
end
up
with
various
groups
that
would,
heaven
forbid,
say
they
were
in
favor
of
lower
taxes,
or
some
other
single
issue.
well,
you
can
have
a
view
one
way
or
the
other
on
whether
that's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
as
a
theoretical
proposition,
if
there
were
a
demonstrable
danger
that
the
ballot
would
become
a
laundry
list
of
slogans,
and
if
you
could
prove
that
that
was
at
all
likely
to
happen,
that
it
was
more
than
some
kind
of
theoretical
possibility,
that
that
would
be
different.
but
in
williams
v.
rhodes
the
court
said
that
theoretically
imaginable
dangers
of
multitudinous
fragmentary
groups
getting
on
the
ballot
aren't
enough,
and
that
you
can
deal
with
that
by
making
it
less
easy
to
get
on
the
ballot.
to
deal
with
it
in
a
slanted
way,
not
by
neutrally
raising
the
requirement
but
by
saying
you
can
get
on
the
ballot,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
do
or
do
not
pass
the
threshold
numerical
limit,
but
what
we
don't
want
you
to
do
is
be
on
the
ballot
if
the
person
you
favor
is
the
same
one
someone
else
has--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--cross-filing
by
major
parties?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
would
depend,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
whether
you
had
a
sore
loser
situation.
that
is,
i
do
think
that
the
court's
decisions
make
it
quite
clear
that
a
state
has
the
power,
as
in
storer,
to
protect
the
integrity
of
both
political
parties
and
of
various
routes
to
the
ballot,
and
to
do
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
case,
certainly,
because
the
court
has
said
among
other
things
that
you
can
limit
individuals
to
a
single
nominating
act.
it's
a
little
like
an
extrapolation
from
the
one-person-one-vote
rule.
it's
not
clear
that
people
should
be
able
to
get
lots
of
bites
at
the
same
sort
of
preliminary
apple.
that
is,
it
may
well
be
that
as
one
of
the
rules
of
the
road
a
state
could
say
that
at
the
primary
stage
if
you're
running
for
office
through
that
particular
avenue
you
have
to
pick
one
primary
or
the
other.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
to
be
honest,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
sure
that
even
that
would
be
justified,
but
if
that
would
be,
it
would
not
be
justified
unless
you
gave
a
veto
power.
that
is,
if
you
said
that
when
both
parties
are
perfectly
happy
to
have
this
happen,
when
neither
of
them
vetoes
the
simultaneous
entry
of
a
candidate
into
both
primaries,
then
the
idea
that
the
state
would
simply
be
protecting
parties
from
fragmentation
wouldn't
justify
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
state
does
not
have
an
interest
that
would
suffice
to
prevent
that.
where
it's
possible...
i
mean,
if
one
said
that
what
this
does
is
pose
the
problem
that
storer
involved,
that
is,
a
problem
in
which
a
political
party
with
its
primary
loses
integrity
and
finality
because
those
who
don't
win
can
pick
up
their
marbles
and
go
elsewhere,
that
problem
can
be
solved.
but
unless
there's
a
general
system
whereby
the
state
can
say
only
certain
people
are
eligible
to
run
in
our
primary,
and
it
might
well
be
permissible
for
the
state
to
allow
a
party
to
have
those
rules,
to
have
a
rule
of
this
kind
is
not
at
all
a
neutral,
politically
neutral
regulation.
that
is,
it's
one
thing
to
have--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
they
certainly
don't
have...
justice
scalia,
i
think
they
certainly
don't
have
to
go
out
of
their
way
affirmatively
to
handicap
things
to
benefit
small
parties,
but
what
minnesota
has
done
is
to
say
that
on
the
ballot
not
only
may
you
but
you
must
put
your
party
affiliation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
a
great
many
say
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there's
no--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
there's
no
question,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
are
a
great
many
states
that,
at
the
turn
of
the
century,
made
this
move,
the
political
historians
seem
to
agree,
in
order
to
marginalize
the
growing
power
of
the
minor
parties,
and
in
order
to
do
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
that
would
hardly
be
a
better
justification
constitutionally--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--whatever
one's
politics.
but
the
main
point
is,
no
one
has
said,
studying
the
situation,
that
the
reason
was
one
of
these
plain
vanilla
reasons
like,
some
people
like
confusion
and
others
don't,
and
they
should
have
a
right
not
to
be
confused,
or
they
can't
figure
out
how
to
use
these
ballots.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
the
court
has
said
that
you
can't
deliberately
disadvantage
some
minor
parties.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
i
would
urge
a
distinction
between
the
basic
architecture
of
the
system,
that
is,
the
decision
to
have
single
member
rather
than
multimember
districts,
and
having
decided
that,
therefore
ruling
out
proportional
representation
within
the
single
member
districts.
the
decision
of
the
basic
design,
when
you
said
that
that
was
intended
to
have
an
effect
on
minor
parties,
i
think
the
evidence
is
that
it
was,
as
with
most
of
these
things,
multifarious
in
its
intentions.
there
are
some
people
who
think
that
the
choice
of
a
single
rather
then
multimember
districts
has
a
number
of
positive
effects
on
avoiding
the
submergence
of
certain
minority
groups.
when
all
of
those
incommensurables
are
balanced
at
the
threshold
designing
the
system
in
general,
deciding,
for
example,
whether
primaries
or
petitions
are
to
be
used
as
a
way
of
getting
on
the
ballot,
deciding
where
co
draw
district
lines,
at
that
point,
as
i
think
justice
o'connor
said
in
vandemer,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
have
justiciable
standards
for
assessing
what
the
state
is
doing.
once
the
building
has
been
designed,
once
the
basic
architecture
is
set,
once
you
have
the
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations,
the
fundamental
architecture,
then,
if
you
take
aim
at
the
content
of
political
alliances,
when
you
tell
two
parties
within
this
system
you
can
get
together
about
other
things,
you
can
have
a
mutual
nonaggression
pact,
neither
of
you
will
run
against
the
other,
you
could
pool
your
resources...
in
1944--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
with
all
respect
it's
less
a
matter
of,
you
could
paint
the
big
picture,
we
won't
touch
you,
but
you
can't
paint
the
little
dots.
it's
more
a
matter
of,
you
can
design
the
overall
framework,
and
we're
not
going
to
second-guess
the
kind
of
republican
form
of
government
you
create.
but
then,
when
you
have
essentially
content-based
rules,
when
you
tell
people
you
can
nominate
anybody
unless
the
person
is
popular
enough
that
he
might
appeal
to
another
party,
when
you
do
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
look,
justice--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
scalia,
look
what
that
does.
it
tells
the
voters,
the
members
of
the
new
party,
that
when
they
go
into
the
voting
booth...
let's
suppose
the
new
party
decides
mr.
dawkins
is
the
one
they
want
to
endorse.
they
spend
money
on
him,
and
under
the
laws
of
the
state
they
can...
within
100
feet
of
the
polls
they
can
put
up
signs
saying,
we
believe
in
andy
dawkins.
but
they
don't
want
to
give
up
the
right
to
have
someone
on
the
ballot,
so
they
nominate
john
smith,
and
john
smith
is
on
the
ballot,
and
the
voters
of
the
new
party
have
essentially
the
choice
that
members
of
minor
parties
have
been
relegated
to
in
40
states
since
the
19...
the
early
1900's.
they
go
into
the
ballot
box,
and
they
can
either
waive
their
right
to
vote
altogether
and
give
it
up,
or
they
can
vote
for
john
smith,
whom
they
and
their
party
doesn't
really
believe
in,
or
they
can
vote
for
dawkins,
and
they're
told
that
that
would
be
a
good
thing
to
do,
but
then...
then
the
other
party
gets
credit.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
that
it's
clear
a
state
cannot
simply
forced
herd
everybody
onto
the
left
or
right
side
of
the
road
in
terms
of
political
association,
and
minnesota
doesn't.
it
says,
you
can
join
together
in
this
party,
but
at
the
price
of
either
wasting
your
vote,
waiving--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--only
at
this
price,
justice
o'connor.
if
they
vote
for
dawkins,
and
assume
for
the
moment
as
in
many
of
the
cases
it's
a
statewide
candidacy,
when
they
vote
for
dawkins
they
strengthen
a
party
they
strongly,
or
perhaps
somewhat
disagree
with.
they
also
entitle
it
to
public
funds
because
those
votes
are
counted
on
the
dfl
line.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
it
seems
to
me
that
given
what
this
court
said
in
burdick,
precisely
that
voting
is
not
simply
an
exercise
in
blowing
off
steam,
to
be
told
that
the
power--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
i'm
not
urging
that
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
look,
justice
o'connor,
first--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
is
only...
it
would
only
be
a
holding
as
broad
as
that
of
the
eighth
circuit,
which
we
do
urge
but
which
we
would
not
require
for
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment,
that
would
lead
to
that
conclusion,
because
that
would
be
a
holding
that
says,
not
only
do
you
have
a
right
to
consensual
fusion,
but
a
right
to
a
separate
ballot
line
or
column
for
the
party--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
part.
i
don't
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
no.
justice
kennedy,
what
isn't
lost
is
the
point
you
made
in
dissent
in
burdick,
i
think,
but
it
is
really
a
point
that
the
whole
court,
i
suspect,
agreed
with
in
that
context,
and
that
is,
you're
not
at
least
required...
even
if
you
don't
have
disaggregation
you're
not
required
in
casting
a
vote
to
help
exercise
power,
not
just
expression,
in
a
direction
that's
opposed
to
your
views.
that
is,
the
votes
that
members
of
the
new
party
are
permitted
to
cast
for
someone
on
the
dfl
party
line
are
votes
that
increase
the
money,
the
public
money
that
goes
to
the
dfl
later
and
that
helps
earn
and
retain
major
party
status
for
it.
there's
a
write-in
provision,
and
this
is
quite
intriguing,
i
think.
there
is
a
write-in
provision
in
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
if
the
candidate
were
somehow
unqualified,
which
is
not
argued
here,
were
it
not
objectively
eligible--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
suppose
when
you're
dealing
with
someone
who
from
this
court's
perspective
might
be
rather
anonymous,
dawkins,
it
might
not
seem
like
such
a
terrible
thing.
i
don't
know
mr.
dawkins.
but
if
it
were
earl
warren,
or
dwight
eisenhower,
or
colin
powell,
to
tell
someone,
oh,
you
can
pick
anyone,
just
not
that
one,
why,
because
the
other
party--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
he
shares
many
of
their
values.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
of
course,
they
haven't--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--they
haven't
said
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
does
matter,
doesn't
it--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
the
touchstone,
justice
breyer,
is
that
this
tells
people
what
the
substance
of
their
consensual
political
alliance
may
be.
the
substance.
it
may
be
that
it
doesn't
matter
a
great
deal
that
somebody
that
the
substance
focuses
on
one
person,
but
it
says,
you
can't
organize
your
associational
interests
across
party
lines
around
an
individual.
it
would
be
very
much
like
saying
you
can't
have...
you
can
have
a
party--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
just...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
your
question
and
justice
scalia's
suggest
to
me
a
considerable
difference
between
a
state
that
says,
all
we
care
about
is
who
gets
elected.
we're
not
going
to
have
a
party
identification.
in
that
case,
the
difference
between
the
ability
to
endorse
and
the
ability
to
nominate
vanishes.
you're
all
on
the
same
playing
field
arguing
about
who
you
want.
but
that
is
not
this
case,
and
it's
very
important
to
draw
a
distinction.
in
this
case,
the
state
says
in
its
ballot
laws
that
next
to
each
candidate's
name
must
be
either
the
word
independent,
or
a
party
name
or
principle
of
three
words
or
less,
and
that
people
can
write
in
for
someone
but
they
cannot
write
in
the
name
of
someone
who's
already
there.
so
that
there
is
a
specific
rule
that
says
even
though
we've
designed
our
ballot
in
such
a
way
that
you
can
indicate
who
you
want
even
if
that
person
hasn't
been
nominated,
you
can't
indicate
who
you
want
if
it
happens
to
be
the
nominee
of
another
party.
it
is
a
targeted
way,
not
of
saying
the
purpose
of
our
ballots
is
not
to
serve
as
billboards.
it's
to
exercise
power.
that
the
court
said
in
burdick
is
fine.
it's
a
way
of
saying,
we
are
designing
the
system,
we're
engineering
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
preclude
agreement
among
people
of
a
certain
kind
expressed
not
through
some
use
of
the
ballot
that
the
state
hasn't
already
legitimated,
but
through
the
standard
use
of
the
ballot
so
that
it
in
effect
is
a
targeted
way
of
shaping
the
kinds
of
consensual
alliances
people
can
have.
if
someone
said--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
after
burdick
i
would
certainly
argue
that
you
could
eliminate
all
write-ins,
but
if
you
allow
write-ins,
you
can't
tell
people
that
the
name
you
write
must
be
a
name
not
otherwise
on
the
ballot.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
it...
it
is
the
minnesota
law,
but
that's
not--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
just
shows
how
the
law
operates,
i
think.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
most
people
actually
suggest
that
it
would
be
far
more
marginal
than
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
anticipated,
mostly
because
the
benefits
of
a
third
party
nomination
are
often
going
to
be
somewhat
dubious,
and
so--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
someone...
if
mr.
dawkins,
after
a
favorable
decision,
if
there
were
one
in
a
case
like
this,
if
he
were
on
the
ballot
already
in
a
way
that
would
allow
a
voter
to
indicate
upon
choosing
him
whether
the
voter
is
voting
for
him
as
a
member
of
the
dfl
or
as
a
member
of
the
new
party,
that
there
would
also
be
an
additional
right
to
say,
oh,
i
don't
want
to
vote
for
him
as
a
member
of
the
new
party.
up
top,
i
want
to
write
that
in.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
don't
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
would
follow
from
the
right
we're
talking
about
that
you
would
have
a
right--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--you
know,
i
think...
i
don't
want
to
just
do
a
90-degree
turn,
but
i
think
you're
right,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
fact
is
that
if...
if
there
is
a
write-in
mechanism
the
state
has...
they
don't
have
to
have
one,
but
if
they
have
one,
i
don't
think
they
can
tell
you
that
you
better
write
a
name
that
isn't
already
there,
and
i
don't
think
that
would
go
away
even
if
we
prevail.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
california,
justice
kennedy,
they
disallow
fusion
and
they
still
have
these
terribly
long
ballots.
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
reason
at
all,
given
the
history,
to
believe
that
confusion
would
be
enhanced
by
fusion.
and
in
particular,
when
justice
souter
asked
about
the
history,
i
think
that
should
tell
us
a
good
bit.
not
just
why
were
these
things
enacted,
but
where
is
the
evidence
that
in
all
the
years
prior
to
about
1905,
that
hundreds
of
fusion
candidacies
existed,
and
the
evidence
in
new
york
up
to
the
present
that
either
the
stability
of
the
political
system
has
been
seriously
injured,
or
that
people
have
been
obvious...
you
know,
utterly
confused
about
what
to
do--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
dealing
with
a
problem
of
unduly
long
ballots
by
techniques
that
are
not
at
least
facially
neutral,
that
don't
say,
well,
let's
up
it
from
500
to
1,500,
dealing
with
it
by
saying
we
will
allow
some
kinds
of
political
coalitions
and
not
others,
we
will
allow
people
to
have
planks
in
common
in
their
party
platforms,
words
in
common
in
their
party
names,
but
we
won't
allow
them
to
coalesce
around
a
mutually
acceptable
candidate,
it
seems
to
me
not
a
constitutional--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--with
non...
in
the
election
for
nonpartisan
offices
it
is
often
the
case
that
several
parties
nominate
or
endorse,
but
it's
often,
and
typically
the
case
with
judges,
that
no
party
label
is
attached
to
the
judge's
name
in
those
states,
and
that
is
a
possible
solution.
that
is,
if
one
agreed
with
the
position
that
i
think
justice
scalia
was
in
part
suggesting,
that
the
point
of
the
ballot
isn't
necessarily
to
get
information
about
which
party,
then
there
is
a
solution
that's
neutral.
it
perhaps
isn't
the
less
restrictive
alternative,
but
it's
certainly
less
targeted
against
minor
parties,
and
that's
to
say,
no
party
label
on
the
ballot.
anybody
can
endorse
anyone
they
want.
in
tashjian,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
assumed
that
that
was
a
paradigmatic
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
here,
we
move
from
endorsement
to
nomination,
but
the
only
difference
is
that
nomination
in
a
state
that
does
put
the
party
name
on
the
ballot
counts
for
a
great
many
things,
and
to
insist
that
it
not
count
in
precisely
those
cases
when
otherwise
disparate
groups
that
are
not
so
far
from
the
main
stream
that
they
are
satisfied
to
nominate
protest
candidates
coalesce
around
a
nominee,
to
suggest
that
that's
the
one
case
where
it's
not
permissible--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
suppose
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
suppose
you
might
have
to
solve
it
in
some
other
way.
in
texas
there
were
two
morales
running
recently.
i
think
it
is...
it
suggests
that
the
problem
of
confusion,
if
it
is
one,
is
a
problem
that
is
not
plausibly
correlated
to
the
idea
of
fusion
candidacies.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you.
