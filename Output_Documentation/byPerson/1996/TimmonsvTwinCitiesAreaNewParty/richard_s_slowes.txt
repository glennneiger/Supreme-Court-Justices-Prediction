mr.
richard
s.
slowes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
is
whether
the
laws
of
minnesota
and
those
of
some
40
other
states
that
limit
each
candidate
to
one
party
designation
on
the
election
ballot
should
be
overridden
by
the
desire
of
a
party
to
place
on
that
ballot
as
its
candidate
someone
who
is
already
on
the
ballot
as
a
candidate
of
another
party.
in
this
case,
minnesota's
law
preventing
multiple
party
nominations
prevented
the
respondent
new
party
from
placing
on
the
minnesota
election
ballot
as
its
candidate
representative
andy
dawkins,
a
democratic-farmer-labor
legislator
who
was
already
on
the
ballot
as
the
dfl
candidate.
the
case
involves
a
narrow
aspect
of
political
party
activity.
it
is
not
about
the
ability
of
a
party
to
generally
select
its
candidates.
it
is
not
about
the
ability
of
a
party
to
generally
get
its
candidates
on
the
ballot.
it
is
about
the
narrower
issue
of
a
political
party
that
wishes
to
put
on
the
ballot
somebody
else's
candidate
who
is
already
there.
minnesota's
law
that
precludes
that
activity
does
not
freeze
the
status
quo.
in
fact,
in
minnesota
in
the
1994
election
a
third
party
qualified
as
a
major
party.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
in
this
instance
what
happens
is,
and
what
really
controls
here,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
candidate
must
file
an
affidavit
of
candidacy,
and
on
the
affidavit
of
candidacy
he
must
indicate
his
political
party.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
in
this
instance,
representative
dawkins
had
filed
an
affidavit
of
candidacy
for
the
democratic-farmer-labor
primary.
that
affidavit
of
candidacy
was
already
on
file
when
the
new
party
attempted
to
file
another
affidavit.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
if
representative
dawkins
had
said
yes--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--i'll
file
this
affidavit
of
candidacy
listing
the
new
party
as
my
party,
filed
it
with
the
county
officials--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--i
would
presume
that's
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact,
in
his
affidavit
which
he
submitted
in
this
case
he
indicated
he
is
a
lifelong
dfl
member,
that
he
believes
in
the
dfl
party,
and
if
elected
to
the
legis--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--your
honor,
that
would
not
be
permitted
by
the
law.
first
of
all,
the
law--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--the
state
interests
are
multiple,
justice
stevens,
and
what
they
have
to
do
with,
a
number
of
issues
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
compelling
state
interests,
although
we
don't
believe
that
the
court
has
to
conclude
that
they're
compelling
in
this
instance.
one
of
them
is
the
concern
that
multiple
party
candidacies
can
lead
to
voter
confusion
about
how
to
effectively
cast
your
ballot.
when
the
name
appears
on
the
ballot
numerous
times...
in
fact,
this
recently
happened
in
connecticut
in
one
of
their
elections
where
fusion
was
used.
some
of
the
voters
thought
that
they
had
to
fill
in
every
line
where
the
name
appeared
for
the
vote
to
count.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
justice
o'connor,
in
fact
that's
kind
of
the
narrow
tailoring
that
the
eighth
circuit
suggested
for
that.
we
think--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
your
honor,
that
would--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--well,
apparently
some
voters
in
connecticut
were,
your
honor,
and
one
of
the
issues
in
the
recount
was
how
do
you
deal
with
the
ballots
where
there
are
multiple
markings.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
that's
indeed
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
i
think
that
i
have
to
be
careful,
if
i'm
going
back
to
minnesota,
about
making
that
argument,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
i
think
a
state
can
make
a
judgment.
indeed,
there
is
that
record
in
new
york.
but
it's
a
singular
record.
there
is
no
indication
from
other
states
on
what
will
happen.
there's
not
a
broad
range
of
empirical
experience
with
this.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
there
are
approximately
40,
your
honor.
it's
difficult
to
get
a
precise
count,
because
some
of
the
statutes
are
ambiguous,
and
there
aren't
rulings
about
them.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
roughly
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
your
honor,
so
there's
not
a
broad
range
of
empirical
evidence,
but
there's
also--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--because
we
can't
be
certain
that
the
ballot
is
going
to
be
easily
understandable
in
terms
of
what
they
really
intended
to
do.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
justice
scalia--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
which
was
a
legislative
election
for
a
legislative
seat--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--the
vote
count
has
no
effect
on
the
future
party
status.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
those...
only
statewide
elections
count
in
minnesota
for
major
party
status,
so
that's
really
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
if
it
were
a
statewide
election
there
would
be
that
issue,
and
then
the
state
would
have
the
question
of
how
are
we
going
to
appropriately
deal
with
this
issue.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
it...
they
claim
that
it
does
not,
your
honor,
because
there
are
three
statutes
that
are...
affect
fusion
in
minnesota.
one
of
them
specifically
addresses
that
issue,
but
in
terms
of
a
statewide
election,
the
statutes
that
are
at
issue
here
would
apply
to
statewide
elections
as
well,
so
if
they
are
struck
down
then
it
would
strike
down
fusion
for
statewide
elections
and
you--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--the
state
would
have
to
retune
its
system,
figure
out
how
it
is
going
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
how
you
count
the
votes
for
a
major
party,
along
with
the
issues
such
as
are
we
going
to
have
an
aggregated
or
a
disaggregated
ballot.
that
is,
does
the
candidate
get
a
separate
line
for
each
party
that
nominates
him.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
state's
ability
or
inability
to
figure
out
how
it
wants
to
count
these
votes
toward
major
party
status
is
the
preeminent
interest
that
justifies
the
fusion
ban,
but
i
think
it
illustrates
a
slightly
different
point,
and
that
is,
what
goes
into
creating
a
fair
and
orderly
and
efficient
electoral
process
involves
a
lot
of
judgments,
essentially
a
lot
of
political
engineering
about
how
the
pieces
of
the
system
will
work
together.
this
is
just
one
of
those
pieces,
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
where
the
states--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--the
justifications...
i
think
voter
confusion
is
an
interest,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
side
point
of
it.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
justice
ginsburg,
our
position
is
not
that
it's
irrelevant.
our
position
is
that
that
kind
of
communicative
use
of
the
ballot
is
not
constitutionally
compelled.
in
fact,
we
don't
elect
parties
at
the
elections,
we
elect
candidates.
we
use
the
ballot
to
decide
which
of
these
candidates
is
going
to
hold
the
official
office
that
the
election
is
for.
in
fact,
if
mr.
dawkins
were
elected
on
the
dfl
ballot,
or
as
a
dfler,
there's
nothing
that
prevents
him
from
the
next
day
turning
around
and
becoming
a
republican.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy,
i--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--and
i...
let
me
try
to
address
that.
other
interests
that
are
involved:
one
of
the
concerns,
and
this
relates
to
the
confusion
as
well,
is
that
confusion
sets
up
a
situation
that
is
ripe
for
ballot
manipulation.
it
creates
a
situation
where
candidates
can,
in
a
sense,
create
bogus
minor
parties
so
that
they
can
get
their
name
on
the
ballot
more
than
one
time
to
give
them
an
advantage,
or
perhaps
taking
it
even
a
step
further--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
and--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--let
me
go
back
to
the
first
question,
your
honor.
in
minnesota
we
make
it
very
easy
for
minor
parties--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--to
get
on
the
ballot.
in
this
district
it
would
take
500
signatures
on
a
nominating
petition--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--to
get
someone
on
the
ballot.
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
it
doesn't
require
party
organization.
it
doesn't
require
a
lot
of
things
that
other
states
require,
so--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--because
major
party
candidates
might
very
well,
if
they're,
for
example...
this
wasn't
the
case
with
mr.
dawkins,
but
if
they're
in
a
case,
an
election
where
they
do
have
a
tough
contest
with
an
opposing
major
party,
they
might
decide
that
it's
to
their
advantage
either
to
have
their
name
on
the
ballot
more
than
one
time,
or
they
might
even
prefer
to
have
their
name
on
the
ballot
not
only
as
a
democratic
candidate,
but
also
as
the
no-new-taxes
candidate,
and
the
tough-on-crime
candidate,
and
the
fusion
system,
especially
in
a
state
like
minnesota
that
is
friendly
to
minor
parties
getting
on
the
ballot
and
makes
it
easy
to
do
it,
opens
the
door
for
that
kind
of
ballot
manipulation.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
there
are--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--justice
o'connor,
there
are
two
ways
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
minnesota.
for
major
parties,
which
we
now
have
three
of,
those
candidates
have
to
go
through
a
primary
election,
and--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
they're
in
the
second
category.
we
only
have
two
categories.
either
you
are
a
major
party,
or
you're
just
everything
else--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--to
get
on
the
ballot
you're
required
to
file
a
nominating
petition.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
on
the
general
election
ballot.
all
you
have
to
do
is
file
a
nominating
petition
that
has
the
requisite
number
of
signatures.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
major--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--yes,
your
honor.
major
party
candidates
have
to
go
through
a
primary.
everybody
else
can
get
on
by
filing
a
nominating
petition
with...
the
number
of
signatures
differs
per...
for
office,
but
for
this
office
it
was--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
that's--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--that's
all
we're
talking
about,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
and
as
i
was
saying,
because
it
is
so
easy
to
get
on
that
general
election
ballot
for
nonmajor
party
candidates,
it
opens
the
door
for
this
kind
of
ballot
manipulation.
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
respondent
suggest
that
we
can
take
care
of
that
by
simply
raising
our
signature
threshold,
make
it
tougher
to
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
your
honor,
their
interests
again
are
as
i've
started...
tried
to
be
telling
you.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
they--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--it
all
depends
on
the
nomenclature
you're
using.
if
you're
talking
about
nominating
a
candidate
as
meaning,
we're
going
to
name
this
candidate
and
he
will
be
on
the
ballot
as
our
candidate,
then
that's
what's
prevented
by
fusion.
what
is
not
prevented
is
endorsement
of
a
candidate.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
supporting
the
candidate--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--yes.
in
fact,
california
has.
california
was
unhappy
with
that.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
there
was
a
criticism
about--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--what
happened.
it
reduced
party
responsibility,
or
reduced
responsibility
for
governing,
and
there's...
actually
there's
criticism
of
the
new
york
system,
that
it
does
the
same
thing
by
allowing
major
parties
to
cross-nominate,
it
can
prevent
problems.
everybody
doesn't
see
this
as
a
universal
panacea.
and
justice
stevens,
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
again,
what
this
court
has
looked
at
in
the
past
in
evaluating
election
statutes
is,
is
the
state
setting
up
formidable
barriers
to
participation,
and
when
it's
looked
at
the
rights
of
parties
to
nominate
the
candidates,
it
really
hasn't
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
party
has
a
right
to
select
a
particular
candidate.
it
has
to
have
the
door
open
to--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
members
of
the...
and
the
members
of
that
party
have
the
kinds
of
associational
rights
that
this
court
has
found
are
most
important.
that
is,
they
retain
the
right
to
work
collectively
to
advance
a
candidate
that
they
support,
and
they
can
vote
for
that
candidate.
the
minnesota...
the
law
of
minnesota
keeps
nobody
off
the
ballot.
it's
unlike
all
of
the
statutes
that
this
court
has
struck
down
in
this
area.
it
doesn't
keep
anybody--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--your
honor,
we
think
that--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
storer
is...
supports
us.
in
storer,
the
court
upheld
california
disaffiliation
statutes
that
prevented
two
independent...
two
former
democratic
party
members
from
running
for
congress
as
independent
candidates.
the
suit
was
brought
not
just
by
those
potential
candidates,
but
by
some
of
their
supporters.
the
disaffiliation
statute
upheld
in
storer
was
far
more
restrictive
of
supporters'
rights,
of
parties'
rights,
because
it
eliminated
a
much
huger
pool
of
candidates
than
does
a
fusion
ban,
and
yet
the
court
upheld
it.
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
in
anderson--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--the
disaffiliation
requirement
in
california
was
12
months
before
the
primary,
so
somebody
had
to
disaffiliate,
i
believe
it
was,
something
like
17
months
before
the
general
election.
it
was
quite
a
long
time.
but
there's
another
difference
that
makes
the
storer
case
even
more
of
a
restriction
than
this,
in
that
it
not
only
had
a
much
broader
range
of
candidates
who
were
excluded,
but
they
were
totally
excluded
from
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
it
had
a
justification
of
preserving
the
stability
of
the
party
system
and
the
electoral
system,
and
that's
some
of
the
justification
for
this
statute.
i
kind
of
haven't
been
able
to
get
through
them,
but
that's
certainly
one
of
the
interests
that
minnesota
is
interested
in,
and
that
is
avoiding
the
excessive
factionalism
that
the
court
found
was
problematic
in
a
case
like
storer.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
justice
ginsburg,
in
storer,
where
the
same
answer
could
have
been
that
if
we
just
do
a
consent
requirement
then
that
will
avoid
splintering,
the
court,
facing
a
statute
that
was
much
more
restrictive
than
minnesota's,
didn't
require
narrow
tailoring.
the
dissent
by
justice
brennan
suggested
that
there
were
things
that
could
have
been
done
to
the
california
statute
to
tailor
it
more
narrowly.
shorten
the
disaffiliation
period.
apply
it
only
to
sore
losers.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
well,
the
minnesota
statute
doesn't
permit
it,
your
honor,
even
with
the--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--while
the
disaffiliation
statute
in
storer
also
didn't
permit
a
candidate
to
run,
there
was
obviously
candidate
consent
because
the
candidate--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--no,
your
honor,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
they
attempted
to
obtain
that
permission.
they
did
obtain
the
permission--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--of
candidate
dawkins,
and
that
is
in
the
record.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
any
attempts
to
get
dfl
permission,
or
whether
the
dfl
gave
permission
and,
indeed,
there
has
been
much
made
about
the
fact
that
the
dfl
did
not
object,
but,
of
course,
the
law
prohibited
this,
so
there
was
no
reason
for
the
dfl
to
object.
again,
getting
back
to
the
interests
of
the
state,
what
we
have
here
is
we
have
issues
of
confusion,
and
while
the
eighth
circuit...
and
justice
o'connor,
you
suggest
that
they
can
use
instructions,
but
we
think
that
part
of
the
reality
of
voting
is
that
first
of
all
not
all
voters
are
as
comfortable
as
everybody
might
be
with
a
lengthy
written
ballot
with
detailed
instructions.
that's
just
the
reality
of
it.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
justice
scalia's
debate
about
whether
new
yorkers
are
smarter
than
minnesotans--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--but
that
is
the
reality.
the
other
thing
about
it
is
that
voters,
a
lot
of
voters
don't
have
a
lot
of
time
to
spend
in
the
voting
booth.
they
may
be
voting
on
their
way
to
work,
trying
to
get
to
work
on
time.
they
may
be
voting
on
the
way
home,
trying
to
pick
up
the
kids
at
day
care,
and
they
can't
be
standing
there
with
a
long
ballot
reading
the
instructions.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
justice
souter,
there
are
a
number
of
responses
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
with
respect,
yes,
i
think
it
is
unfair
for
you
to
look
back
that
many
years,
particularly
because
this
court
has
said
in
united
states
v.
o'brien
and
other
cases
that
a
legitimate
constitutional
state
statute
will
not
be
struck
down
merely
because
there's
some
allegation
of
improper
motive.
and
here,
to
compound
that,
the
allegation
of
improper
motive
is
a)
indirect...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
what
the
minnesota
legislature
was
thinking
or
said
about
this
statute.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
reflects
what
the
minnesota
legislature--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--there
is
a
balancing
that
has
to
be
done,
justice
scalia.
we
believe,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
some
cases
that,
indeed,
and
that's
part
of
what
was
animating
storer
in
some
sense,
that
the
state
does
have
an
interest,
a
generalized
interest
in
preserving,
in
a
sense,
political
stability,
and
that--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--your
honor,
i
didn't
make
that
point,
and
in
honesty
i
don't
make
that
point
strongly.
i
think
that
is...
i
think
that
is--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--well,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
would
agree.
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
states
do
have
a
permissible
choice
to
be
made
there,
as
long
as
they
don't
go
so
far
as
to
close
the
door
to
minor
party--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--our
position
is
that
the
disproportionate
burden
argument
that
the
respondents
are
making
would
really
take
you
into
all
of
those
areas,
because
they
suggest
that
if
there
is
an
aspect
of
the
system
that
would
be
more
beneficial
to
minor
parties...
they
say
fusion
is
more
beneficial
to
minor
parties.
therefore,
by
not
permitting
it
you
are
impermissibly
burdening
minor
parties,
and
the
same
could
certainly
be
said
for
an
absence
of
multimember
districts
or
proportional
representation--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--which
would
certainly
help
minor
parties.
the
same
might
be
said
about
nonpartisan
ballots,
which
are
had
in
many
states.
minor
parties--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--what
it
comes
down
to,
your
honors,
is
that
these
are
issues
of
political
engineering.
the
court
has
not
established
a
bright
line
test,
justice
breyer,
to
say
that
we
can
tell
where
is
so
far.
what
it
has
is
the
balancing
test
from
anderson.
but
if
you
look
at
the
landscape
of
the
cases,
where
it
has
found
that
states
have
gone
too
far,
they
have
gone
far
beyond
anything
that
the
minnesota
statute
does.
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
because,
your
honor,
it
gets
back
to
the
argument
you
just
made
a
few
minutes
ago.
new
york
can
make
that
judgment,
that
we
think
in
our
state
this
kind
of
system
can
work,
and
we
can
have
a
workable,
stable
political
system.
that
should
not
dictate
to
the
other
states
that
they
adopt
that
same
system
as
long
as
the
systems
that
they
adopt
do
not
establish
formidable
barriers
to
minor
party--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--the
court
has
said
you
can't,
and
there
may
be--
mr.
richard
s.
slowes
--there
is
a
line
that
this
court...
again,
it's
not
a
bright
line,
but
there
is
a
line
beyond
which
the
states
cannot
go
in
terms
of
preserving
the
stability
of
the
system.
williams
v.
rhodes,
and
anderson
v.
celebrezze.
when...
thank
you.
