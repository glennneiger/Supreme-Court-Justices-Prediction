i
guess
you
could
have
instructions
on
the
ballot
telling
people
what
to
do
in
that
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
would
be
possible,
i
guess,
to
have
instructions
along
with
a
ballot
that
did
permit
parties
to
name
the
same
person
as
their
candidate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
states
have
these
antifusion
laws
like
your
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
most
of
them
have
been
in
effect
how
many
years?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
explain
how
the
minnesota
system
works?
when
you
say
get
on
the
ballot,
are
you
referring
to
get
on
the
ballot
for
the
primary
election?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
getting
on
the
general
election
ballot?
i
thought
there
was
some
special
provision
in
your
state
for
minor
parties
to
put
a
candidate
on
the
general
election
ballot.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
this...
this
party,
the
twin
cities
area
new
party,
did
not
have
to
go
on
the
primary
election
ballot,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
you're
everything
else,
how
do
you
get
past
the
primary
and
on
the
general
election
ballot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
on
the
general
election
ballot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
major
parties
can't
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
go
through
a
primary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
access
to
the
general
election
ballot,
in
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
whether
the
minor
party
can
nominate
the
same
candidate
as
some
other
party--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--who's
gotten
there
by
primary
election.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
case
of
ours
is
closest
to
supporting
your
view,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
storer,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
minnesota
and
probably
39
other
states.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
so
we're
talking
about
a
major
effect
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
ruling
in
your
favor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
or
some
say
to
keep
the
republicans
in
office
historically.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
at
bottom
the
key
first
amendment
interest
is
being
able
to
vote
for
who
you
want
to
on
a
general
election
ballot.
there
is
a
right
in
minnesota
very
easily
to
get
someone
on
the
general
ballot
if
you're
a
minor
party.
that's
not
difficult,
and
at
the
general
election
ballot
at
least
all
the
members
of
this
party
can
vote
for
the
candidate
they
truly
support.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we've
also
said
there
is
no
right
to
express
something--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
ballot.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
no
right
of
expression
there,
and
this
verges
closely
on
that.
we
want
to
show
we
have
nominated
this
same
person.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
real
problem
in
cases
where
two
candidates
have
virtually
the
same
name.
talk
about
voter
confusion--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
we've
seen
that
recently
in
northern
virginia.
it
would
be
pretty
disastrous
to
have
two
people
with
the
same
name
and
no
party
designation.
