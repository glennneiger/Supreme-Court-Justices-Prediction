somebody
else's
candidate
that
is
already
there.
who
gets
the
first
peck?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
new
party
had
filed...
well,
the
same
thing
would
happen
if
the
new
party
had...
what
if
the
new
party
had
put
up
dawkins
first?
does
that
mean
the
democratic-farmer-labor
party
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
run
dawkins?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
new
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
new
yorkers
are
smarter,
i
think.
that's
probably
the
answer.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
have
to
know
what
party
they
voted
for
doaks
on
in
order
to
determine
who
gets
on
the
ballot
without
having
to
go
through
a
petition
process
the
next
time
around,
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
minimum
party
size?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
argument
would
be
a
valid
argument
in
other
elections,
although
not
in
this
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
thought
they
could
pick
their
own
nominee.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
minnesota--
--no,
they
can.
they
just
can't
have
it
shown
on
the
ballot
as
a
nominee
of
that
party.
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
record,
i
was
being
facetious.
[laughter]
--running
for
election
anywhere,
but
even
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
wouldn't
concede
the
major
point,
would
you,
that
there
is
something
wrong
about
the
state
establishing
its
electoral
machinery
in
such
fashion
as
to
facilitate
and
encourage
a
two-party
system
as
opposed
to
the
kind
of
systems...
proportional
voting,
for
example.
that
alone
favors
a
two-party
system.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that,
so
long
as
you
don't
ban
third
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
just
saying
if
that
were
the
value,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
unconstitutional,
as
i
thought
you
were
conceding.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
you
just
say,
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
new
yorkers
like
confusion.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
possible
to
draw
a
politically
neutral
electoral
system,
it
seems
to
me.
you're
always
making
judgments
that
are
either
going
to
favor
larger
parties,
are
going
to
disfavor
larger
parties,
favor
smaller,
disfavor
smaller...
i
mean,
the
mere
decision
whether
to
have
party
affiliation
shown
on
the
ballot,
for
example,
that's
going
to
make
a
big
difference.
how
can
you...
why
is
it
necessary
for
the
state
to
draw
up
a
balloting
system
that
does
not
disfavor
small
parties?
i
think
they
can
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
it's
pretty
plain
vanilla
to
say,
i
like
a
two-party
system,
and
this
fosters
the
two-party
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
that
make
any
difference?
it's
sort
of
like
saying
you
can
paint
the
whole
building
green
but
you
can't
paint
the
window
frets
green.
it's
okay
in
the
most
fundamental
design
of
the
system,
in
those
aspects
that
have
the
most
impact,
to
act
out
of
two-party
system
motivation,
but
it's...
in
the
details
of
it,
oh,
no,
you
cannot
act
out
of
a
two-party
system
moti...
that
makes
no
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
haven't
said
that.
they
have
not
said
that.
they
can
nominate
whomever
they
want.
they
have
just
said,
look,
if
we
are
running
the
electoral
system,
we
decide
whether
parties
will
be
shown
or
not.
you're
using
our
advertising
in
the
system.
you
may
nominate
anybody
you
like
and
you
may
advertise
it
in
the
paper.
the
new
party
backs
so-and-so.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
on
the
ballot,
he
will
not
be
shown
under
your
party.
you
can
still
support--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whoever
you
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
has
very
successfully
preserved
the
two-party
system
in
those
states
that
have
it,
whereas
in
states
like
new
york
it
has
become
a
three-party
system.
now,
must
a
state
decide
that
it
wants
the
one
rather
than
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
just
boil
down...
what
you
just
said,
does
that
not
merely
boil
down
to
the
fact
that
the
new
party
can...
is
entitled
to
have
a
candidate
but
is
not
entitled
to
have
any
particular
candidate?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
one
of
the
qualifications,
that
you
not
be
the
candidate
of
another
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
pick
a
party.
you
can
be
a
candidate
of
any
party.
if
you're
a
candidate
of
some
other
party,
the
new
party
can
pick
all
the
rest
of
the
candidates
in
the
world,
but
not
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
presume
that
your
argument
would
also
extend
to
the
write-in
prohibition,
that
if
we
found
for
you
in
this
case
we
would
also
say
that
the
state
could
not
prevent
you
from
writing
in
the
democratic
candidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
this
guy
to
win,
but
you
don't
want
anybody
to
think
that
you're
voting
democratic--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
so
you
write
in
his
name
separately.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
right
not
to
be
counted
for
a
party
just
as
important
as
the
right
to
be
counted
for
a
party,
which
is
what
you're
arguing
for
here?
i
think
the
right
not
to
be
counted--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
a
member
of
that
party
is
just
as
important.
