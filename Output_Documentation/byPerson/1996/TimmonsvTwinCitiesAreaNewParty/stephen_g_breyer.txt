justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
legally
if
i
think
that's
the
whole
point?
that
is,
if
i
think,
which
i'll...
if
i
think
that
the
whole
point
to
justify
these
things
is
a
two-party
system
and
the
democratic
advantages
that
that
entails,
weighed
against
a
multiparty
system
and
the
democratic
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
that
entails,
all
right.
suppose
i
think
that
this
represents
a
judgment
of
the
legislature
to
go
in
the
two-party
direction
as
opposed
to
proportional
representation.
but
as
you
say,
you're
not
putting
any
weight
on
that,
so
should
i
simply
say
forget
it
and
move
on
to
the
arguments...
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
measure
so
far?
i
take
it
the
single
member
district
is
constitutional.
i
take
it.
maybe.
i
don't
know.
is...
what
about
the
first
past
the
post?
what
about
the
reforms
italy
wants
to
make
in
order
to
move
in
the
two-party
direction?
or
just
winner
take
all.
what
is
the
test?
i
mean,
winner
take
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
why
isn't
the
argument,
well,
new
york
is
not
italy,
nor
is
it
fourth
republic
france,
and
this
goes...
is
not
really
a
problem,
and
therefore
there
really
isn't
a
justification.
here
it
goes
too
far.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
the
point
that's
bothering
me,
and
i'm
putting
this
a
little
more
strongly
than
i
think,
but
i
want
to
get
your
response
to
this.
there
are
a
lot
of
rules
deliberately
disadvantaging
third
and
fourth
and
fifth
parties...
first
past
the
post,
single
member
districts.
there
are
good
arguments
for
and
against
such
things.
proportional
representation
in
many
parties
allows
parties
to
grow
more
quickly
and
is
a
better
representation
of
people's
views.
on
the
other
hand,
two
parties,
which
is
a
much
worse
representation,
and
interferes
with
people's
ability
to
choose
what
they
want,
has
the
advantage
that
we
know
whom
to
hold
responsible
for
good
or
bad
government.
now,
you,
like
i,
have
read
both
those
positions
argued
at
depth,
so
where
the
constitution
is
at
stake,
how
can
we
say
that
a
state
doesn't
have
the
right
to
choose
between
those
two
different
views
of
democratic
representation?
and
i
know
it's
a
matter
of
degree,
but
what
i
keep
coming
back
to
is
thinking
this
was
a
fairly
marginal
method
of
giving
the
republicans,
if
you
like,
or
republicans
and
democrats,
an
advantage
as
to
the
swing
voters
who
were
somewhat
indifferent,
who
would
go
and
look
at
the
columns
on
the
ballot
and
they'd
see
dfl
here,
or
they'd
see
new
party
here,
and
if
they
saw
new
party
with
a
popular
candidate,
they'd
vote
new
party
all
the
way
down
the
line.
you
see,
that
would
help
that
party,
and
it
might
better
reflect
views,
but
it
would
undermine
the
kind
of
responsibility
that
the
classic
argument
for
a
two-party
system
democratically
holds
is
important,
so
how
am
i
to
judge
that?
how
can
i
say
that
the
state
has
no
right
in
these
kinds
of
things
to
decide
either
of
those
two
models
that
it
believes
is
the
more...
better
democracy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can
vote
for
him.
but
they
all
can
vote
for
him.
we
know
why
they
want
mr.
dawkins.
i
suppose
the
reason
the
smaller
party
wants
him
is
he'll
attract
support.
he'll
attract
money.
he'll
attract
a
lot
of
things
that
help
the
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course.
oh,
yes...
oh,
that's
certainly
true.
so
of
course
to
stop
that
is
to
interfere
with
the
ability
of
these
people
to
build
their
party.
and
then
what
bothers
me
is
the
other
side
saying,
of
course.
you're
right.
that's
the
reason
we
want
this
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now,
of
course,
they
can't
go--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
all
right.
that's
a
separate--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
i
imagine
that...
and
of
course
this
isn't
going
so
far,
anywhere
near
as
far
as
to
ban
a
third
party.
it
doesn't
go
nearly
as
far
as
the
single
member
district.
it
doesn't
go
nearly
as
far
as
first
past
the
post.
there
are
many
greater
inhibitions
than
this
one.
so
what
i'm
looking
for
is,
what's
the
touchstone
to
decide
here
whether
this
interference
goes
too
far
in
light
of
the
objective?
