chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-1608,
michele
timmons
v.
the
twin
cities
area
new
party.
mr.
slowes,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
presume
he
would
not
have
done
that
if
he
wanted
to
be
elected.
[laughter]
i
mean
that
if
he
was
going
to
get
the
dfl
nomination,
he
would...
he
could
only
get
one.
he
would
have
settled
for
the
dfl.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
california
for
many
years
had
cross-filing.
that
was
how
earl
warren
got
elected
in
the
primaries
without
ever
even
going
through
a
general
election.
could
a
state
ban
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
they
didn't
like
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
changed
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
minnesota
statute
doesn't
presently
require
the
consent
of
the
dfl
party
for
this.
it
just
requires
the
consent
of
the
candidate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
right,
yes.
yes,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
respondent
in
this
case
obtain
the
permission
of
the
dfl
party?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
candidate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
slowes.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--new
yorkers
like
it,
it
doesn't
mean
minnesotans
have
to
like
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
some
sense
to
that,
isn't
there,
mr.
tribe?
if
a
candidate
is
both
dfl
and
then
gets
behind
small,
third
party,
lower
taxes
party,
tough
on
crime,
it
makes
the
ballot
into
a
form
of
really
communication,
which
in
burdick
we
said
the
state
didn't
have
to
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
california's
prohibition
against
cross-filing?
if
we
rule
for
you
here,
does
that
strike
that
down,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
cross-filing
by
candidates.
a
candidate
filing
in
both
the
republican,
or
seeking
the
nomination
of
both
the
republican
and
the
democratic
parties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
there's
no
sore
loser...
the
primary
begins,
he's
on
both
ballots,
and
he
wins
both
ballots.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
that
be
justified
and
minnesota's
rule
here
not
be
justified?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
an
open
primary
system
a
party
can't
veto
a
candidate.
i
mean,
in
most
states
if
i
want
to
run
for
the
nomination
of
the
socialist
party
and
they
have
an
open
primary
ballot
the
socialist
party
can't
get
together
and
say,
well,
we
don't
want
him.
i
have
a
right
to
run,
and
if
a
majority
favor
me,
i
get
nominated.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
do
that.
you
just
can't
get
on
a
separate
ballot
line.
you
can
organize
your
interests
all
you
want
to
until
you
get
to
the
voting
booth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
but
that
isn't
involved
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
your
principle
would
involve
that.
if
we
were
to
rule
for
you,
it
would
result
in
quite
sweeping
changes,
and
in
a
lot
of
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
this
goes
to
write-ins,
too,
which
isn't
a
third
party.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
to
allow
people
to
write
in
someone
who's
already
on
the
ballot,
you're
creating
a
great
deal
of
additional
problems
in
counting
the
ballot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we're
breaking
down
all
these
nuances,
certainly
that
would
be
absolutely
permissible.
maybe
there
wouldn't
be
many
of
them,
but
you
couldn't
say
no,
i
don't
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
