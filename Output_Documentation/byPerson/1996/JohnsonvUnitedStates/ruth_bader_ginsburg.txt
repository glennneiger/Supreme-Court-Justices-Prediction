justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sheppard,
the
element
was
still
in
the
case.
it
was
just
believed
to
be
materiality
was
for
the
judge,
not
that
you
didn't
have
to
prove
materiality,
so
what
was
the
difference
in
the
proof
you
said
that
shaped
trial
attorney's
strategy?
the
element
has
to
be
proved.
what
was
different
about
the
proof
that
was
presented
of
the
materiality
here
from
what
it
would
have
been
if
the
trier
had
been
a
jury
rather
than
a
judge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
for
example,
could
you
show
us
what
trial
counsel
might
have
made
of
the
materiality
of
these
statements
were
the
matter
tried
to
a
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
asked
for
that
instruction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sheppard,
sometimes
evidence
on
a
particular
element
is
so
strong
that
the
defendant
would
rather
not
have
the
jury
confront
that
element,
and
we
had
such
a
case
this
term.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
we're
told
that
the
element,
at
least
the
eleventh
circuit
thought
that
the
proof
was
overwhelming,
and
we
have
a
trial
record
where
the
defense
counsel
is
saying,
please,
judge,
don't
say
the
word
materiality
to
the
jury,
how
do
we
know
that
this
case
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sheppard,
but
we
know
that
all
kinds
of
things
go
wrong
in
jury
trials,
and
judges
give
the
most
opaque
charges,
that
you
could
look
at
the
jury
and
they
don't
know
what
the
heck
the
judge
is
talking
about,
and
we
accept
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
i
take
it
that
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
maybe
some
other
circuit
also
the
court
of
appeals
rule
is
that
you
don't
have
to
make
a
rule
30
instruction
when
it
would
be
futile
if
you've
got
clear
circuit
precedent
in
point
going
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
are
you
then
saying
this
is
a
case-by-case
determination,
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
look
at
the
record
and
see
how
much
evidence
there
was
of
materiality
so
that
the
materiality
evidence
was
controversial
then
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sheppard,
isn't
it
so
that
in
the
cases
where
there
were
complaints
about
a
sixth
amendment
violation
because
women
weren't
being
put
on
juries
that
the
only
defendants
who
got
the
benefit
of
that
rule
were
the
ones
who
had
made
a
contemporaneous
objection?
i'm
thinking
particularly
of
doran
v.
missouri.
