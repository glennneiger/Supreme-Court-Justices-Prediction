chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-203,
joyce
johnson
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
sheppard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
eleventh
circuit
certainly
didn't...
doesn't
agree
with
your
precedent...
they
said
after
reviewing
the
record
in
this
case,
we
find
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
materiality
of
johnson's
statement.
no
reasonable
juror
could
conclude
that
johnson's
false
statements
about
the
source
of
the
money
were
not
material.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
not...
they
may
have
said
that,
they
may
not
have,
but
i
was
simply
reading
what
they
said
about
the
evidence
of
materiality,
which
was
what
you
were
talking
about.
you
say
it
should
have
been
determined
by
a
jury,
but
that's
a
different
thing
from
saying
that
it
was
a
very
thin
case
for
materiality.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
there
simply
couldn't
be
any
harmless
error
analysis
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
a
jury
verdict
finding
the
person
guilty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
sheppard.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
seems
a
bit
odd,
mr.
dreeben.
i
take
it
proof
on
materiality
would
be
either
cross-examining
government
witnesses...
i'm
not
sure
you'd
do
it
greatly
differently
before
a
jury
than
you
would
before
a
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben--
--was
this
case
tried
before
or
after
the
ninth
circuit
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
it
depends
on
kind
of
the
frame
of
mind
of
the
judge,
of
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
an
error
is
plain
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sheppard,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sheppard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
