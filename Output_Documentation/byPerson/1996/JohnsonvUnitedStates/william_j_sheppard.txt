mr.
william
j.
sheppard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
joyce
johnson
was
tried
and
convicted
on
a
single
count
of
perjury,
in
violation
of
18
united
states
code
1623.
her
conviction
occurred
6
months
prior
to
this
court's
holding
in
gaudin.
her
trial
was
conducted
in
total
reliance
on
the
then-existing
and
long-standing
precedent
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
for
more
than
50
years
had
removed
the
element
of
materiality
from
the
jury.
that
precedent
further
provided
that
the
judge
would
instruct
the
jury
that
the
element
of
materiality
had
been
found
in
favor
of
the
government.
trial
counsel's
entire
preparation,
strategy,
and
performance
in
the
trial
was
dictated
by
this
now-overruled
precedent.
this
reliance
on
the
wrong
precedent
from
beginning
to
end
of
the
proceedings
caused
an
infection
of
the
proceedings
and
rendered
them
totally
different
than
what
our
constitution
requires.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
justice
ginsburg,
we
agree
that
the
element
was
there
and
the
government
had
the
duty
to
prove
it,
albeit
a
footnote
under
eleventh
circuit
precedent
was
questionable
as
to
what
the
standard
of
proof
was,
but
i
submit
that
when
a
lawyer
gets
a
case,
what
he
does,
he
looks
to
see
what
are
the
elements
of
the
case,
and
i
think
that's
the
first
thing
that
a
lawyer
does.
he
pulls
the
statute.
he
then
goes
to
the
standard
jury
instructions,
and
what
happened
here
was
that
counsel
had
to
persuade
a
judge,
and
was...
his
opportunity
to
persuade
a
jury
was
taken
away,
and
i
submit
that
cases
are
tried
based
on
elements
starting
from
beginning
to
end,
with
the
questions
that
you
prepare
to
submit
to
a
district
judge
to
ask
in
voir
dire,
when
we
get
up
and
make
opening
statements.
inevitably,
those
opening
statements
focus
on
elements.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
yes,
ma'am,
i
believe
i
can.
ms.
johnson
in
her
grand
jury
testimony
was
never
asked
directly,
did
you
receive
the
money
that
went
into
the
renovation
of
your
home
from
the
target
of
this
grand
jury
investigation,
or
we
assume
it
is,
mr.
fields?
she
told
the
grand
jury
that
she
got
money
for
the
renovation
of
her
home
from
her
mama,
when
indeed
she
was
never
asked
directly
did
it
come
from
fields.
well,
if
it
came
from
a
third
source...
suppose
she'd
robbed
a
bank
and
put
the
money
in.
it
would
not
have
been
material
as
to
any
investigation
of
mr.
fields.
secondly,
i
believe
that
the
cross-examination
of
the
jury
foreman,
and
even
more
specifically
of
special
agent
william
stull
of
the
fbi,
who
testified
that
the...
about
what
the
grand
jury
was
investigating,
that
cross-examination
was
severely
limited
because
counsel
knew
that
50
years
of
precedent
in
his
circuit
and
70
years
of
precedent
in
all
of
the
circuits
as
it
relates
to
a
perjury
prosecution,
that
that
element
was
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i
agree
that
that's
what
they
said,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
they
aren't
the
individuals
that
our
history
and
the
precedent
of
this
court
says
ought
to
be
answering
those
kinds
of
questions,
and
as
this
court
unanimously
held
in
gaudin,
and
respectfully,
the
eleventh
circuit
is
just
squarely
wrong
when
they
say
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
which
is
the
first
codified
law
in
this
nation,
isn't
a
substantial
right.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i'm
not
here
to
argue
that
this
was
a
thin
case.
i
was
responding
to
justice
ginsburg's
case...
question.
i'm
here
to
argue
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
for
the
citizens
in
this
country
is
so
historically
in
place,
and
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
has
reinforced
time
and
time
again
the
eleventh
circuit
is
wrong,
just
as
the
government
is
wrong.
they
say
we've
waived
this
right
or
forfeited
it
by
not
objecting.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
this
is
not
a--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--in
two
respects,
justice
breyer.
one,
in
this
case
the
court
did
not
misinstruct
about
the
element.
it
totally
omitted
the
element.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
it's--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--well,
if
i
could
go
back
to
your
earlier
question
to
answer
it
first,
sir,
the
second
thing
that
is
different
in
this
case
than
just
a
misinstruction
on
an
element,
in
addition
to
totally
omitting
it,
the
eleventh
circuit
pattern
jury
instruction
number
43,
which
was
taken
from
cases,
and
that's
found
in
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
at
page
67,
that
instruction,
which
was
taken
from
precedent
of
the
old...
of
the
fifth
circuit,
prior
to
congress
creating
the
eleventh
circuit
and
carrying
over
the
precedent
of
the
fifth
to
the
eleventh
provided,
and
this
jury
was
indeed
instructed,
that
the
materiality
of
the
matter
involved
in
the
alleged
false
testimony
is
not
a
matter
with
which
you
are
concerned,
but
rather
is
a
question
for
the
court
to
decide.
and
then
went
on,
you
are
instructed
that
the
questions
asked
the
defendant
as
alleged
constituted
material
matters
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings
referred
to
in
the
indictment,
and
respectfully,
justice
breyer,
that
is
a
partial
directed
verdict
in
a
criminal
case.
it's
not
just
a
misdescription
of
an
element.
and
the
way
cases
are
tried
from
voir
dire
to
opening
statement
to
closing
argument
to
instructions
are
all
within
the
structural
framework
of
elements.
that's
just
the
way
we
lawyers
do
it,
and--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--well,
absolutely.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
and
even
before
the
trial,
trial
counsel
was
filing
motions
in
limine
because
trial
counsel
and
the
lawyers
who
try
these
cases,
we
believe
in
precedent,
and
we
believe
that
when
you're
in
the
face
of
longstanding
precedent,
that
it
is
not
principled
lawyering
to
waste
time
making
frivolous
objections--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--i
don't
think
in
the
face
of
50
years
of
precedent
in
that
circuit
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
way
to
handle
it.
you
can't
invite--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--no,
ma'am,
and
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
it
doesn't
urge
that
position,
but
i
still...
even
if
they
did,
i
don't
think
invited
error
can
be
invited
without
waiver
or
stipulation,
and
there
wasn't.
there
were
motions
in
limine
prior
to
trial
in
this
case
seeking
to
limit
evidence
going
to
the
jury
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
only
be
relevant
as
to
materiality,
and
why
should
the
government
be
allowed,
in
violation
of
rule
403,
to
put
on
evidence
that
was
not
relevant,
and
was
nothing
but
prejudicial?
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
you
know,
from
reading
the
cases,
justice
kennedy,
that's
a
good
question.
i
think
they're
all
tried
differently
in
about
three
or
four
different
protocols,
depending
upon
which
circuit
you're
in.
but
respectfully,
i
was...
or
the
trial
counsel
was
seeking
to
exclude
the
evidence
that
could
only
be
relevant
as
to
materiality
from
going
to
the
jury,
and
trial
counsel
was
doing
that
because
he
was
in
the
face
of
massive
precedent
that's
dictated.
not
only
is
this
element
not
going
to
be
going
to
the
jury,
but
i
am
also
affirmatively
going
to
direct
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
government
if
i
find
it
is--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--well,
respectfully--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--well,
but
respectfully,
the
wrong
entity
is
judging
the
defendant
guilty.
the
trial
judge
took
away
from
the
jury
25
percent
of
her
jury
trial.
she
got...
it
would
be
like
going
to
a
four-dog
dog
fight
and
you
only
get
three,
because
we're
going
to
take
that
one
away
from
you,
and
respectfully,
the
wrong
entity
is
judging
the
defendant
guilty,
and
respectfully,
i
believe
the
error
goes
up
the
next
line
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
when
they'd
say
the
three
of
us
are
going
to
substitute
these
12
citizen
jurors'
opinion
of
what
that
evidence
might
be,
and--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--there
is
nothing
for
harmless
error
analysis
to
attach
to.
there
is
no
jury
verdict.
there
is
no
object
upon
which--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--well,
but
it's
not
a
valid
jury
verdict
if
it's
only
three-quarters
of
what
the
constitution
in
the
history
of
our
country
says
to
us
we
have.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--i
don't
think
so
in
a
directed
verdict
case,
as
we
have
here,
or
a
partial
directed
verdict.
not
only
was
this
taken
away
from
the
jury,
but
the
judge
told
them,
don't
be
bothered
with
it,
don't
concern
yourself
with
it,
and
i
find
it
so.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
both
the
defense
and
the
government.
that
instruction
had
been
in
place
in
the
fifth
circuit,
or
the
eleventh
circuit
pattern
jury
instructions
since
1985,
when
the
district
judges
association
promulgated
such
instructions,
and
it's
interesting,
in
some
circuits...
and
you
know
you
have
the
tenth
circuit
and
ninth
circuit
en
banc
ruling
that
this
is
harmful
error
and
per
se
reversal...
they
take
different
approaches,
but
these
types
of
cases
fall
into
two
distinct
categories.
some
circuits'
pattern
jury
instructions
only
say,
don't
concern
yourself
with
materiality.
i
would
want
to
rephrase
that
and
say
there's
three
distinct.
some
of
them
say,
don't
concern
yourself
with
materiality.
some
of
the
pattern
jury
instructions
that
are
used
say
nothing
to
the
jury.
they
just
instruct
the
jury
on
the
other
three
elements
of
perjury.
oath,
false
statement,
knowing,
say
nothing
about
false
statements.
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
we
submit
adds
a
double
injury
to
the
plaintiff,
or
to
the
defendant
in
this
case,
the
judge
says,
don't
you
be
concerned
with
materiality,
and
i
find
it,
and
those
are
the
most
egregious
instructions,
and
those
that
i
respectfully
submit
for
two
different
theories
require
reversal.
they're
both
violations
of
the
fifth...
or,
they're
a
violation
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i'm
familiar
with
old
chief.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
because
you're
the
wrong
entity
to
be
making
that
decision.
in
addition,
prior
to
that
occurring
in
the
trial,
or
during
the
trial...
i
won't
say
it
was
prior
because
i
don't
frankly
recall,
but
the
record
is
clear
that
counsel
made
a
rule
29
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
and
directed
that
29
motion
to
materiality.
materiality
was
hotly
litigated
throughout
the
course
of
this
case,
returning
to
my
earlier
point,
with
motions
in
limine,
objections,
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
but
it
was
all
done
with
a
mind
set
knowing
what
the
judge
was
going
to
do
when
he
instructed
the
jury,
and
that's
just
a
structural
defect
in
these
proceedings
that
render
it
absolutely
meaningless.
there
is
no
meaningful
jury
verdict.
there
is
no
case,
i
submit,
that
anybody
can
cite
that
says
in
a
homicide
case
the
court
can
just
take
away
one
of
the
elements.
that
isn't
the
way
we
work.
we
have
the
whole
idea
of
the
jury's
conscience.
the
conscience
of
the
citizens
is
greater
than
that
of
judges,
and
that's
why,
in
the
early
colonial
times
in
this
country,
that
the
right
to
jury
trial
was
just
hammered.
it's
the
only
right
i've
located
in
the
federal
constitution
that
is
explicitly
pointed
out
in
three
different
places.
if
you
ask
100
lawyers,
where
do
we
get
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
they
will
tell
you
the
sixth
amendment,
not
knowing--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
in
order
to
rule
for
the
government,
you'd
have
to
go
along
with
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
is
to
say
we're
not
going
to
grant
relief
here
because
counsel
didn't
object.
if
we'd
have
made
a
frivolous
objection...
and
isn't
this
the
legal
irony--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--well,
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
embodies
a
profound
judgment
about
the
way
in
which
the
law
should
be
enforced
and
justice
administered.
it
is
a
structural
guarantee.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
certainly
we
do,
because
that's
our
system,
and
it
is--
[laughter]
and
that
happens.
there's
no
doubt
that
it
happens.
but
if
you
ask
100
laymen,
if
you
went
to
a
four-dog
fight
and
you
only
got
to
have
three
dogs
in
the
fight
against
the
government...
and
remember
that
part
of
the
value
of
the
jury
trial
is
to
protect
the
citizens
against
the
government.
perjury
can
only
be
against
the
government.
it's
one
of
those
specific
crimes
that
is
only
against
the
government.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
probably
not.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
but
it
is...
knowing
is
different
than
materiality.
they
are
different
elements,
totally,
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
in
order
to
follow
the
reasoning
in
the
eleventh
circuit
you've
got
to
call
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
a
nonsubstantial
right,
that
it's
not
a
substantial
right,
and
respectfully
i
don't
think
it
can
be.
but
i
think
here,
that
the
directed
verdict
is
not
opaque.
it's
clear.
so
you
have
a
two-step
analysis
here,
or
two-step
deprivation
here,
not
only
the
omission
of
the
knowing,
but
i'm
going
to
tell
you,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
that
he
knew
it.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i
think
it's
a
total
denial
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
and
i
appreciate
your
correction,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
i
agree
with
that.
i
believe
that
here
the
taking
away
and
then
the
affirmative
statement,
coupled
with
the
entire
framework
in
which
this
case
traveled
because
of
the
longstanding
precedent,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
fundamental
structure
of
this
trial
was
wrong
because
counsel
relied
on
longstanding
precedent,
which
has
been
overruled,
and
under
griffith,
that
ruling
in
gaudin
is
retroactive
to
these
proceedings
because--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--i
think
all
elements
must
be
found
by
a
jury.
i
think
that's
what
gaudin
stands
for,
and
sullivan,
and--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--i
think
our
case
is
stronger
simply
because
of
the
affirmative
direction
of
the
verdict,
of
the
partial
verdict.
but
returning
to
justice
breyer's
question,
this
court
has
ticked
off
a
few
rights
that
are
structural
rights
that
are
per
se
reversible,
and
i
think
it's
time
for
this
court
to
put
teeth
into
the
language
of
cases
that
go
back
to
1945
in
screws,
and
go
back
to--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--if
i'd
have
had
the
opportunity
to
argue
it
to
a
jury,
no
one
can
say
that
i
could
not
have
prevailed,
or
that
ms.
johnson
could
not--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--i
would--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
draw
the
line,
because
i
think
that's
the
way
these
cases,
these
post
gaudin
cases
are
going
to
come
through
the
system.
number
1,
i
think
if
there's
an
omission
and
a
directed
verdict
for
sure
the
defendant
prevails.
if
there
is
merely
an
omission,
i'm
not
so
sure,
but
i
know
at
that
extreme,
given
the
trial
of
the
case
totally
based
on
precedent
that
was
so
longstanding,
that
affected
the
entire
performance,
strategy,
thinking,
handling
of
the
case,
handling
of
the
witnesses,
handling
of
the
jury
instructions,
had
i
been
clairvoyant
and
known
that
you
were
going
to
do
what
you
did
in
gaudin,
do
you
think
i
would
have
asked
for
jury
instruction
number
43?
only
if
i
was
totally
ineffective,
because
without
that
this
petitioner
did
not
have
the
right
entity
making
the
decision
that
caused
her
conviction.
i'll
reserve
my
time.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
language
in
bollenbach
v.
united
states
and
in
cabana
v.
bullock...
if
i
may
refresh
the
court:
in
other
words
the
question
is
not
whether
guilt
may
be
spelled
out
in
the
record,
but
whether
guilt
has
been
found
by
a
jury
according
to
the
procedures
and
standards
appropriate
for
criminal
trials.
that
was
in
bollenbach.
in
cabana,
the
language:
findings
made
by
a
judge
cannot
cure
deficiencies
in
the
jury's
findings
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
a
defendant
resulting
from
the
court's
failure
to
instruct
it
to
find
an
element
of
the
crime.
the
entire
rationale
of
the
plain
error
rule
is
to
prevent
lawyers
from
sand-bagging.
is
it
sand-bagging
to
follow
a
half-a-century
of
precedent?
certainly
not.
to
follow
the
government's
argument
here
is
going
to
cause
lawyers,
experienced
lawyers
to
object
to
everything,
and
for
the
solicitor
to
say
that
there
was
a
lot
of
precedent
out
there
going
on
in
the
country
before
this
trial
is
flat
wrong.
if
you
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
gaudin,
you
will
find
that's
a
1001
case.
this
court
characterized
the
ninth
circuit
as
a
maverick
circuit
on
that
issue
and,
finally
in
that
regard,
the
ninth
circuit
case
was
a
1001
case.
this
is
a
1623
case,
and
at
the
time
of
this
trial
the
precedent
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
materiality
on
a
perjury
case
was
different
than
1001,
and
that
is
not
an
argument
that
helps
this
court.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
in
at
least
two
circuits
they've
got
stay
orders
on
en
banc
cases
awaiting
the
decision
in
this
case,
so
i
don't
know
that
any
lawyer
knows
what
to
do
in
those
circuits
yet,
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
case
to
signal
to
the
trial
bar
what
to
do.
as
to
the
structural
matter,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
harken
to
the
language
in
duncan
v.
louisiana,
which
is
the
case
that
applied
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
a
structural
guarantee
that
reflects
a
fundamental
decision
about
the
exercise
of
official
power,
a
reluctance
to
entrust
plenary
powers
over
the
life
and
liberty
of
the
citizen
to
one
judge
or
to
a
group
of
judges,
and
if
you
apply
52(b)...
52(a)
here,
that
is
indeed
what
you
are
doing.
you
are
pulling
the
rug
out
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
that
is
contrary
to
our
history,
and
i
think
history...
and
we
tried
to
set
forth
some
history.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
and
i
cannot
in
good
conscience
answer
that
question
directly,
because
i
do
not
know,
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
many
of
these
cases,
the
structural
cases,
had
objections
and
some
didn't,
but
i
say
that
if
the
rule
requiring
a
contemporaneous
objection--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
thank
you.
