justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
so
you're
saying
it's
better
to
ignore
an
element
completely
than
it
is
to
have
a
finding
on
an
element
if
the
finding
is
a
nonjury
finding.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
shouldn't
your
answer
have
been
different
on
the
knowing
example,
because
in
the
knowing
example
the
jury
never
made
a
finding
of
knowingly,
never
thought
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
your
approach
be
to
the
case
if
this
case
were
tried
before
the
ninth
circuit
came
out
with
its
decision
before
cert
was
applied
for
here?
let's
assume
all
of
the
circuits
were
of
the
same
view,
that
materiality
is
a
question
for
the
judge.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
that's
what
your
answer
would
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
at
least
in
the
regime
that
we're
hypothesizing,
where
there's
no...
i
think
the
trial
judge
would
have
been
quite
amazed
at
the
request.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
talking
about
our
hypothetical.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining,
or
understanding
how
your
rule
would
play
out.
maybe
it
would
be
of
no
practical
consequence.
on
the
other
hand,
you
might
be
asking
us
to
have
a
practice
where
every
attorney
has
a
list
and
says,
your
honor,
i
make
the
following
list
of
futile
objections.
