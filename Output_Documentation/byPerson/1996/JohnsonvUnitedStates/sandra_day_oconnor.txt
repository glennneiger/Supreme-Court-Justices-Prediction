justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
also
true,
is
it
not,
counsel...
isn't
it
true
that
in
this
trial,
when
the
government
tried
to
put
on
evidence
of
materiality
before
the
jury
and
the
court,
that
the
petitioner's
own
trial
lawyer
wouldn't
allow
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
for
the
judge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
said,
absolutely
keep
that
evidence
out
of
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
invited
error
in
some
case
defeat
the
petitioner's
subsequent
claim
if
the
petitioner
himself
had
said,
you
may
not
consider
materiality?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
that
invited
error
could
defeat
such
a
claim.
now,
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
decide
that
issue,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
the
doctrine
of
invited
error
fit
into
this
whole
picture?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
government
here
at
no
point
raise
that
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
was
before
the
case
became
final.
