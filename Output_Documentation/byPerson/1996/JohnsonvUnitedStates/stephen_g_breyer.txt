justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
every
day
of
the
week
it's
a
common
thing
for
a
judge
to
misinstruct
a
jury
on
an
element
of
a
defense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
which
case
the
jury
has
not
considered
whether
or
not
the
person
did
or
did
not
commit
that
element.
that
happens
every
day
of
the
week,
very
common.
now,
how
is
this
case
different
from
that?
no
one
thinks
it
deprives
a
person
who
doesn't
object
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
that
case.
how
does
this
case
differ
from
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
true,
but
so
what
is
the
difference?
sometimes
that
would
be
more
fair,
sometimes
less
fair
than
a
misinstruction.
your
case
is
one
where
it
wasn't
all
that
unfair.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
cases
misinstructions
are
disastrous,
but...
so
how...
is
that...
why
should
we
draw
that
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
think
anyone
disputes
the
importance
of
the
jury
trial,
but
where
i'm...
my
difficulty
is
that
there
are
only
a
handful
of
things
that
this
court
has
said
is
a
structural
right,
just
a
handful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
find
anywhere
in
that
handful
in
any
of
the
case
law,
though
i
grant
you
it's
somewhat
open,
though
i
think
in
the
roy...
we
removed
it
in
the
habeas
context
and
made
clear
it
wasn't
structural
in
that
context,
so
why
should
it
be
structural
the
fact
that
the
judge
decided
a
matter
that
the
jury
should
have
decided?
i
grant
you
that's
a
wrong
thing
to
do,
but
why
is
it
equivalent
to
the
using
a...
you
know,
not
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
failing
to
do
that?
i
mean,
why
is
it
one
of
the
handful
of
things
that's
of
critical
importance?
in
your
case,
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
wrong
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i'm
looking
for,
actually,
is
the
miscarriage
of
justice
kind
of
standard
here.
that's
what
i'm
focusing
on...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
see
the
problem
i'm
actually
having,
suppose
he
told
the
jury,
jury,
you
know
what
materiality
means?
it
means,
well,
sort
of
likely
maybe
to
make
a
difference.
then
you
wouldn't
be
up
here,
well,
how
does
that
fit?
is
that
a
structural
error,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
just...
really,
he
says
what
materiality
is,
jury,
is
that
materiality
means,
well,
it
has
something
to
do
with
it,
a
little
bit.
i'm
trying
to
focus
you
on
what's
bothering
me
the
most,
which
is
how
one
would
draw
a
distinction...
though
it's
there
in
some
cases,
how
one
would
draw
a
distinction
between
misinstructions,
really
stupid
instructions,
off-the-wall
instructions,
no
instructions...
it
seems
like
a
bog
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
we
accept
your
view,
we're
right
in
the
middle
of
it.
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
worry
me
about
that
is
it
sounds
from
the
history
of
the
plain
error
rule
that
it
was
meant
to
codify
cases
from
this
court
that
described
it
as
a
kind
of
grab
bag,
not
having
a
clear
definition
but
designed
to
permit
a
court
of
appeals
to
correct
a
really
serious
problem
that
can
be
serious
for...
it
was
described
in
one
case
as
a
matter
of
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
confidence
in
the
proceeding.
you
know,
general,
but
what
it
shares
in
common
is
that
something
really
important
went
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it
could
be
a
terribly
bad...
i
mean,
it
depends
on
what
it
is.
i...
you
couldn't
say
in
advance
you
could
never
have
a
terrific
miscarriage
of
justice
but
for
the
circumstance
where
the
trial
judge
knew
what
was
going
on.
i
mean,
why
restrict
it
in
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
his
basic
point
is,
as
i
take
it,
that
look,
if
it's
the
language
of
the
rule,
this
is
error
that
was
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal,
so
the
judge
isn't
foreclosed
from
dealing
with
it.
moreover
he
says
the
appellate
court
should
have
realized
this
is
a
structural
error.
there
was
an
element
of
the
crime
that
the
jury
never
considered
at
all.
everyone
would
say
if
the
judge
had
said
i'm
not
going
to
submit
the
whole
case
to
the
jury,
that's
a
pretty
big
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
same
with
an
element.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
same
with
an
element,
and
therefore
we
should
hold
that
it
is
a
matter
of
the
integrity
of
the
proceeding
and
just
say
it's
automatically
reversible.
now,
your
response
to
that
is
first
that...
this
requirement
you
just
mentioned,
and
then
you
have
a
second
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
the
difficulty
with
the
plain
error
analysis,
though,
mr.
dreeben,
that
the
plain
error
rule
i
think
we
would
all
agree
was
simply
not
devised
to
address
the
situation
of
the
new
rule,
and
therefore
you
either
take
the
tack...
if
you're
going
to
apply
it
to
the
new
rule
situation,
you
either
take
the
tack
that
you
do,
says
it
has
to
have
been
plain
at
the
time
of
trial,
in
which
case
there
will
be,
any
new-rule
case
is
automatically
going
to
be
decided
in
the
government's
favor...
it's
like
sort
of
a
teague
bar
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
objection
below...
or
we're
going
to
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
cut
him
off
like
that,
so
we'll
say
it's
sufficient
if
it's
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal,
and
then
the
real
issue
is
going
to
be
decided
on
the
fourth
olano
prong.
and
would
it
make
more
sense
to
say,
this
isn't
truly
a
plain
error
case,
and
simply
have
a
rule
for
new
rule
cases
and
go
right
to
something
like
the
fourth
olano
prong,
or
something
like
the
harmless
error
standard
if
it's
not
structural?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
quite
agree.
i
think
the
only
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
maybe
we
simply
cannot
sensibly
make
this
into
a
situation
covered
by
the
rule.
maybe
we've
got
to
devise
something
on
our
own
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
structural
errors
that
we
discussed
in
fulminante...
we
did
not
find
that
that
was
structural
error...
might
well
be
something
that's
just
different
than
plain
error,
as
justice
souter
has
suggested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course,
there
the
right
was
known
and
was
established.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
hypothesis...
we
don't
know
we'll
hold
this
way...
the
hypothesis
of
a
structural
right
that
had
not
been
established.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
as
a
matter
of
art,
when
we
wrote
gaudin
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
have
been
rather
difficult
to
say,
and
this
was
plain
error.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
it
is
a
plain
error
case,
just
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
i
think
plain
error
can
be
like
a
grab-bag,
including
errors
that
are
plain
only
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
on
that
assumption...
on
that
assumption,
then
do
you
lose?
