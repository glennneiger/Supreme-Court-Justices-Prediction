yes,
but
your
client--
--but
mr.
sheppard,
supposing
in
justice
scalia's
example,
the
judge
did
just
that
and
said,
don't
you
worry
about
the
knowing.
i'm
going
to
tell
you
the
evidence
is
strong
enough
to
establish
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you
should
answer
no
to
justice
scalia
on
that
one,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
didn't
those
cases
turn
heavily
on
the
fact
there
was
collateral
review,
and
here
you're
on
direct
review.
