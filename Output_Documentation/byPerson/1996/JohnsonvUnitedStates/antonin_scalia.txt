justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
there
is
a
valid
jury
verdict
on
the
other
elements,
and
it
could
be
possible,
could
it
not,
that
as
we've
said
in
some
of
our
earlier
cases,
the
jury
that
found
elements
1,
2,
and
3,
would
necessarily
have
found
element
4?
if
that
were
established,
then
there
would
be
no
problem,
would
there?
wouldn't
that
establish
harmless
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
when
the
jury
has
never
been
given
a...
an
instruction
as
to
what
is,
you
know,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
is
what
one
of
our
earlier
cases
involved,
then
you
have
a
jury
that
said
nothing
at
all.
but
this
jury
said
three
things.
it's
conceivable
that
those
three
things
could
automatically
and
implicitly
include
the
fourth,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sheppard,
let
me
test
whether
you
think
this
thing
is
structural
in
the
narrow
sense
that
our
opinions
have
used
it.
let's
assume
a
prosecution
for
burglary,
and
evidence
is
introduced
that
the
window
was
broken,
that
the...
you
know,
there
was
an
entry.
the
defendant
does
not
counter
that
argument.
his
only
defense,
introduced
by
other
people,
is
that
he
was
somewhere
else.
he
has
an
alibi
defense.
the
judge
forgets
to
tell
the
jury
that
in
order
to
convict
it
must
find
that
the
defendant
knowingly
broke
and
entered
the
house.
now,
here's
a
broken
window,
and
the
guy
walked
in,
somebody
walked
in,
you
know,
in
the
dark,
very
carefully
took
things
out
of
the
house.
it's
possible,
i
suppose...
well,
it's
not
possible.
it's
simply
not
possible
that
a
jury
who
found
that
there
was
a
breaking
and
entering,
and
that
this
fellow
did
it,
would
not
have
also
found
that
he
did
it
knowingly.
on
that
evidence,
it's
just...
the
one
finding
implicitly
includes
the
other.
now,
would
you
say
that
that
conviction
has
to
be
reversed
because
the
judge
did
not
tell
the
jury
that
you
have
to
find
that
this
was
knowingly
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
it's
not
structural.
if
you
say
no,
then
it's
not
a
structural
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
if
you...
the
trouble
with
answering
no--
--i
like
a
man
who
accepts
help
when
it's
offered.
[laughter]
well,
i
don't.
the
trouble
with
answering
it
that
way
is
your
client
in
fact
is
better
off
under
what
happened
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical...
in
this
case,
rather,
than
would
be
the
case
under
the
hypothetical,
because
here
an
actual
finding
is
being
made
about
materiality,
whereas
in
the
hypothetical
what...
whether
it's
knowing
or
not
is
simply
ignored.
your
client
is
better
off
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
trial
judge
have
been
able
to
grant
the
request?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
he
must
make
a
request
which
he
knows
cannot
be
granted.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
strange
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
has
any
circuit
accepted
your
interpretation
of
rule
52,
and
absolutely
refused
to
consider
any
claim
not
raised
below
even
where
the
circuit
law
was
clear?
because
if
anybody
has,
i
guess
we
could
tell
from
the
experience
in
that
circuit
whether
the
horrors
that
some
anticipate
will
occur
if
such
a
rule
is
enforced--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
52
is
enforced
the
way
it's
written.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
sort
of
counterintuitive
to
say
that
it
has
to
be
clear
at
the
time
of
trial,
because
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
you're
going
to
forgive
counsel
for
not
raising
an
objection
that
clearly
should
have
been
raised.
he'll
be
able
to
get
it
in
later
under
the...
but
if
he...
if
it
was,
you
know,
not
clear
at
that
time,
then
his
failure
to
raise
it
is
going
to
be
conclusive
against
him.
isn't
it
just
the
opposite
of
what
you'd
expect?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
why...
i...
you've
said
that
several
times
now.
i
don't
see
that
it
says...
if
the
rule
read,
errors
that
were
plain,
or
defects
affecting
substantial
rights,
then
i
would
understand
your
argument,
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
plain
errors
may
be
noticed.
i
think
that's
susceptible
of
the
interpretation
that
errors
that
at
the
time
you
evaluate
them
are
plain.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
that's
not
what
you're
referring
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sheppard,
what
do
you
say
to
the
government's
argument
that
most
circuits
had
adopted
the
rule
that
if
you
don't
raise
the
objection
you
come
within
these
provisions
even
if
the
objection
would
have
been
futile,
and
it
hasn't
produced,
apparently,
in
those
circuits
the
flood
of
futile
objections
that
you
contend
will
occur.
