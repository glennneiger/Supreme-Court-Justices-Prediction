mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
first
like
to
address
why
the
plain
error
rule
applies
in
this
case,
and
then
turn
to
the
question
of
why
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
relief
under
the
plain
error
rule.
now,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
impose
a
contemporaneous
objection
requirement
on
any
party
that
wishes
to
assign
an
error
either
to
the
trial
court
or
on
appeal,
and
those
provisions
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
the
appendix,
page
3a.
the
first
rule
is
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
30,
which
states
that
no
party
may
assign
as
error
any
portion
of
the
charge
or
omission
there
from
unless
the
party
objects
thereto
before
the
jury
retires
to
consider
its
verdict.
rule
51
amplifies
that
requirement
by
stating
that
exceptions
are
not
necessary,
but
that
it
is
sufficient
that
a
party,
at
the
time
the
ruling
or
the
order
of
the
court
is
made,
makes
known
to
the
court
the
action
which
this
party...
which
that
party
desires
the
court
to
take.
petitioner
did
not
comply
with
those
two
provisions.
she
did
not
object
to
the
court's
instruction
on
materiality.
indeed,
she
had
sought
it,
and
she
did
not
make
the
argument,
which
was
being
widely
made
by
defendants
around
the
country
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
that
materiality
should
be
decided
by
the
jury
rather
than
the
judge,
and
as
a
result
of
failing
to
comply
with
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement
for
these
two
rules,
the
source
for
reviewing
any
claim
of
error
that
she
now
wishes
to
make
is
rule
52(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
its
keys
decision
in
stating
the
principle
that
you
just
articulated
is
actually
to
simply
say,
we
allow
people
to
raise
claims
as
if
they
were
preserved
error,
even
if
there
were
no
objection,
not
actually
that
defense
counsel
are
instructed,
don't
object.
but
if
one
takes
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
as
being
an
instruction
to
defense
counsel
not
to
object,
or
that
there
is
no
need
to
object,
then
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
simply
violated
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
30
and
51.
the
ninth
circuit
cannot
announce
a
supervisory
rule
of
procedure
that
is
in
direct
conflict
with
what
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
actually--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
reason
is
this.
if
one
looks
at
the
way
the
judicial
system
works
from
an
appellate
perspective,
this
court
rarely,
if
ever,
will
entertain
a
claim
that
was
not
raised
and
preserved
below
both
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
even
if
there
is
on-point
authority
against
the
potential
petitioner
at
that
time.
the
court
expects
that
parties
will
comply
with
relevant
contemporaneous
objection
rules
even
if
the
objection
at
the
time
might
be
deemed
futile
under
governing
authority,
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
that.
the
first
is
that
it
shows
that
the
party
really
cares
about
the
issue.
in
this
case,
if
petitioner
had
really
wanted
the
jury
to
resolve
the
materiality
issue,
petitioner
would
have
manifested
that
not
by
acquiescing
in
an
instruction
or
requesting
an
instruction
taking
materiality
away
from
the
jury,
but
by
doing
everything
the
petitioner
could
to
make
the
point
that
she
wanted
the
jury
to
decide
material--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
been
amazed
at
the
request
at
the
time
that
this
trial
took
place
in
1995.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
talking
about
the
hypothetical,
there
are
plenty
of
examples
where
petitioners
have
preserved
claims
in
the
trial
court,
brought
them
up
to
this
court,
and
won
by
overruling
supreme
court
precedent.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
the
trial
judge
would
have
been
barred
by
circuit
law
from
granting
the
request,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
it's
not
strange
at
all
because
it
shows,
justice
scalia,
one
that
it's
important
to
this
petitioner,
which
is
of
value
in
itself.
the
second
reason
is
that
it
will
prompt
the
petitioner
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
or
whatever
supplementation
of
the
record
the
petitioner
feels
is
appropriate
to
show
what
that
petitioner
would
have
done
differently
if
the
law
had
been
in
its
favor,
which
facilitates
subsequent
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
by
this
court
of
whether
any
error
that
occurred--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
would
not
necessarily
do
it
differently,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
would
show
what,
if
any,
theory
the
petitioner
had
that
she
wanted
to
present
to
the
jury,
and
in
this
case
there
was
no
demonstration
of
what
the
petitioner
would
have
done
differently.
we've
heard
today
that
the
course
of
the
trial
would
have
been
differently.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
had
the
government
made
and
preserved
a
claim
of
invited
error
that
might
well
be
the
correct
way
for
this
case
to
be
resolved
under
cases
such
as
johnson
v.
the
united
states
in
318
u.s.--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
did
not
argue
invited
error
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
district
court,
everybody
operated
on
the
assumption
that
materiality
would
be
decided
by
the
judge.
when
gaudin
was
decided,
petitioner
for
the
first
time
raised
a
claim
that
materiality
was
decided
by
the
judge--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct,
so
petitioner
is
entitled
to
say
that
based
on
this
court's
intervening
precedent
error
occurred,
and
then
the
question
becomes
how
do
you
analyze
the
consequences
of
that,
and
our
submission
is
that
the
text
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
themselves
require
that
it
be
analyzed
as
plain
error
unless
we
had
had
available
to
us
an
invited
error
argument
and
had
made
it,
which
we
did
not.
petitioner's
argument
is
that
you
should
just
disregard
the
text
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
either
because
an
objection
would
be
deemed
futile,
or
because
the
error
here
should
be
characterized
as
structural
and
that
somehow
structural
errors
are
exempt
from
contemporaneous
objection
requirements.
neither
of
those
submissions
are
correct.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
textual
exception
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
objections
later
deemed
futile,
and
this
court
indeed,
in
considering
the
analogous
issue
in
the
habeas
context,
has
held
that
futility
is
not
a
ground
for
excusing
procedural
default
in
failing
to
raise
a
claim
before
the
relevant
tribunal
in
the
state
system.
in
engle
v.
isaac
the
court
squarely
held
that
even
if
a
claim
is
perceived
correctly
by
a
litigant
to
be
futile,
it
is
not
cause
for
failing
to
raise
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
yes,
justice
stevens,
those
cases
are
on
collateral
review,
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
the
court
thought
that
there
are
benefits
to
requiring
a
party
to
object
before
the
relevant
tribunal
with
power
to
decide
even
if
on-point
governing
law
at
the
time
was
adverse,
and
it
did
not
carve
out,
even
in
an
exercise
of
its
discretionary
authority,
an
exception
from
the
procedural
default
rule
for
claims
that
would
be
perceived
as
futile.
i
think
this
case
follows
a
fortiori,
because
here
we
have
express
provisions
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
contain
no
futility
exception,
and
it
would
be
even
more
of
a
step
for
the
court
to
carve
out
of
an
express
text
of
a
rule
an
exception
for
something
that
it
has
not
even
recognized
in
its
discretionary
capacity
on
habeas
review.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
kennedy,
we
too
are
concerned
not
with
attorneys
who
would
want
to
try
to
preserve
every
conceivable
claim
in
the
chance
that
some
day
the
court
might
reverse
it.
what
we're
dealing--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
those
few
probably
would
no
matter
what
this
court
told
them,
but
the
point
here
is
that
the
class
of
claims
that
are
likely
to
result
in
a
reversal
of
existing
precedent
between
the
time
of
trial
and
appeal,
such
that
a
petitioner
similarly
situated
to
the
petitioner
here
might
say
the
law
is
changed.
i
didn't
object
below
because
the
claim
would
have
been
futile.
now
i
have
a
good
claim
on
my
hands.
that
class
is
not
a
large
claim...
large
class
of
claims,
and
astute
defense
counsel
who
care
about
the
issue
will
watch
it.
defense
counsel
were
raising
the
materiality
objection
that
this
court
excepted
in
gaudin
all
over
the
country,
even
before
the
en
banc
ninth
circuit
decision
came
down.
certainly
after
that
decision
came
down
it
was
being
raised
widely.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
case
was
tried
6
months
after
the
ninth
circuit's
en
banc
ruling
in
gaudin
and
6
months
before
this
court's
ruling
affirming
that
ruling
in
gaudin,
so
petitioner
was
clearly
on
notice
that
this
was
a
claim
that
had
been
excepted
not
only
by
a
federal
court
of
appeals
but
by
several
state
courts,
and
was
clearly
an
issue
that
was
in
play.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
there
are
two
separate
points.
one
is,
is
she
within
rule
52
at
all
because
she...
52(b),
plain
error...
because
she
did
not
object.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
my
knowledge,
every
circuit
but
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
accepted
that
view.
in
other
words,
all
of
the
circuits
that
have
addressed
this
issue
except
for
the
en
banc
tenth
circuit
and
the
en
banc
ninth
circuit
have
held
that
if
you
do
not
object
at
trial,
even
if
the
objection
was
futile,
you
are
within
the
plain
error
provisions
of
rule
52,
and
the
claim
must
be
evaluated
for
plain
error
and
not
reversed
unless
it
is
plain
error.
two
circuits
have
said
plain
error
is
out
of
balance.
that's
the
position
that
i
say
is
squarely
incorrect.
now,
turning
to
the
question
of
how
rule
52(b)
is
applied
if
this
is
treated
as
a
plain
error
case,
we
have
two
arguments
on
why
this
error
at
the
trial
should
not
be
reversed
under
the
plain
error
rule.
the
first
is
that
the
plain
error
rule
should
be
read
to
require
that
the
error
be
plain
both
at
the
time
of
trial
and
at
the
time
of
appeal,
not
simply
at
the
time
of
appeal.
now,
as
to
that
claim,
justice
scalia,
i
will
acknowledge
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
not
gone
down
that
route.
the
d.c.
circuit
does
read
rule
52
the
same
way
that
we
do,
and
has
required
parties
to
raise...
has
said
that
if
the
claim
is
clear
at
the
time
of
appeal
it
must
also
be
clear
at
the
time
of
trial
in
order
to
come
within
rule
52,
so
the
d.c.
circuit
agrees
with
us
on
that
point,
but
then
the
d.c.
circuit
has
improvised
what
it
calls
a
supervening
decision
doctrine
that
allows
it
to
review
claims
when
new
law
comes
along
at
the
time
of
appeal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
plain
error
rule
as
described
by
this
court
in
united
states
v.
frady
is
to
permit
the
court
of
appeals
to
remedy
error
that
was
so
gross
and
so
egregious
that
the
trial
judge
himself
was
derelict
for
not
noticing
it,
even
though
the
defense
counsel
or
the
prosecutor
had
not
brought
it
to
his
attention.
and
in
a
case
like
this
the
trial
court
was
certainly
not
derelict
in
its
duties
in
not
sending
materiality--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
it
depends
on,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
clarity
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
trial.
if
the
law
at
the
time
of
trial
is
clear,
so
that
the
trial
judge
is
on
notice
that
what
i'm
supposed
to
do
is
send
materiality
to
the
jury,
and
if
the
defendant
and
the
prosecutor
both
fail
to
bring
that
to
the
trial
court's
attention,
the
trial
court
is
nonetheless
under
an
obligation
to
comply
with
the
governing
law.
and
as
this
court
described
in
frady,
we
then
have
a
situation
where
the
court
of
appeals
may
notice
that
plain
error,
because
the
trial
judge
should
have
figured
it
out
on
his
own
even
though
the
parties--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that,
justice
breyer,
that
the
cases
from
this
court
with
perhaps
only
one
exception,
did
involve
errors
that
were
clear
to
the
trial
judge
at
the
time--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i...
the
first
reason
is,
i
think
that
the
language
of
rule
52(b)
itself
contemplates
that
what
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
is
the
same
thing
that
is
now
being
recognized
on
appeal,
namely,
obvious
error,
and
it
is
hard
to
say
that
it
is
obvious
error
for
the
trial
judge
to
miss
a
claim
like
this.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
my
first
response,
just
to
clarify,
is
that
i
think
the
language
of
the
rule
itself
does
not
say
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal.
it
describes
the
character
of
error
that
is
both
not
called
to
the
judge's
attention
and
raised
on
appeal
as
plain
error,
and
in
our
view
that
requires
that
the
error
be
obvious
at
both
stages.
now,
there
may
be
other
forums
for
a
defendant
to
raise
a
claim
that
a
horrible
miscarriage
of
justice
occurred,
but
the
question
is
whether
this
rule
is
the
vehicle
for
that,
and
our
submission
is
that
it
is
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
ultimately
ask
the
same
question
that
is
comprehended
by
the
fourth
prong
of
olano,
and
considering
all
the
circumstances,
is
it
an
infringement
on
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings
to
affirm
this
conviction,
so
long
as
that
inquiry
is
part
of
the
mix,
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
think
the
government
could
live
with
a
formulation
such
as
your
honor
is
describing.
the
point
about
the
obviousness
at
the
time
of
trial
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
rule
with
a
text,
and
there
are
various
situations
that
can
arise
under
that
rule
where
the
error
was
not
clear
at
the
time
of
trial
but
is
clear
at
the
time
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
general
authority
to
essentially
take
this
kind
of
a
case
out
of
the
rule.
that
was
the
point
of
my
description
of
rules
30
and
51.
she
did
not
object.
therefore,
she
did
not
preserve
her
error.
therefore,
rule
52(b)
is
the
essential
source
for
reviewing
her
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
this
court
has
already
crossed
that
bridge,
justice
kennedy.
the
court
has
held
that
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
grand
jury
is
a
structural
error,
and
that's
vasquez
v.
hillery,
but
the
court
has
twice
held,
both
in
the
shotwell
case
and
in
the
davis
case,
that
if
a
party
fails
to
make
a
contemporaneous
objection
to
the
racial
composition
of
the
jury,
that
party
may
well
forfeit
any
opportunity
to
get
relief
from
such
a
claim,
so--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
accept
the
hypothesis
that
the
structural
right
that's
claimed...
i
don't
agree
that
it
is
structural,
but
i'll
take
that
in
a
second...
that
the
right
that's
established
didn't
become
known
to
the
world
until
this
court
ruled
in
gaudin,
but
by
hypothesis,
this
court
did
not
invent
the
constitutional
right.
that
constitutional
right
was
one
that
was
possessed
at
the
time
of
trial
and
was
being
actively
asserted
by
litigants
around
the
country
who
wanted
to
have
that
ruling
applied
to
their
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question
of
plain
error.
that's
the
question
that
we
have
before
us
today.
the
rules
themselves,
however,
do
not
provide
any
room
for
the
court
to
say,
we
simply
are
not
going
to
enforce
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
you're
reading
rule
52(b)?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
was
referring
to
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm...
i
was
discussing
with
justice
kennedy
the
question
of
whether
the
court
should
treat
this
as
a
plain
error
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--or
whether
it
should
just
analyze
it
as
if
the
error
had
been
preserved.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
a
plain
error
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
we
then
proceed
to
our
second
argument
on
why
the
error
in
this
case
does
not
entitle
petitioner
to
relief
under
the
plain
error
rule.
the
fourth
and
final
prong
of
olano
requires
the
court
to
examine
whether
correcting
the
error
serves
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
more
precisely,
the
court
has
said
the
error
shall
not
be
corrected
unless
it
seriously
affects
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
it
is
our
view
that
when
you
have
a
case
like
this
one,
it
would
not
serve
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings
to
reverse.
petitioner
has
never
articulated
a
theory
on
which
a
properly
instructed
jury
might
have
returned
a
determination
that
the
statements
here
were
not
material.
until
her
reply
brief
in
this
court,
she
never
even
articulated
anything
that
she
would
say
on
that
issue.
in
the
trial
itself,
she
objected
when
evidence
of
materiality
was
put
on.
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
is
that
there
was
no
defense
to
materiality
in
this
case.
the
evidence
of
earl
fields'
drug-dealing
which
was
being
investigated
by
the
grand
jury
was
deemed
by
the
petitioner
to
be
prejudicial
to
her
interests,
and
she
wanted
if
at
all
possible
for
the
jury
not
to
hear
that
and
not
to
think
about
it.
her
defense
was
that
the
statements
were
true.
she
had
an
opportunity
to
argue
to
the
trial
judge
that
these
statements
were
immaterial.
her
sole
argument
consisted
of
a
one-sentence
remark,
i
think
that
these
statements
are
immaterial.
the
trial
judge
who
heard
the
evidence
and
examined
her
record
concluded
that
the
statements
were
material.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
i
think
that
as
a
bedrock
principle,
when
you
have
a
case
like
this
one,
where
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
that
a
retrial
would
produce
a
different
outcome,
that
the
plain
error
rule
dictates
affirmance,
not
reversal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
the
right
balance
of
interests,
if
the
court
doesn't
accept
our
argument
on
obviousness
at
the
time
of
trial,
and
one
is
looking
at
this
from
the
overall
weighing
process
at
the
final
step
of
olano,
that
the
question
that
should
be
foremost
in
the
court's
mind
is,
is
there
any
reasonable
probability
that
this
constitutional
error
made
any
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
trial?
if
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
of
that,
and
by
that
i
don't
mean
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
the
jury
might
have
acquitted,
it's
just
is
the
court
confident
that
this
is
a
fair
verdict,
then
the
court
should
affirm.
if
the
court
believes
that
the
evidence
is
such
that
the
jury
might
have
come
out
the
other
way,
the
petitioner
had
a
plausible
theory,
the
trial
judge
didn't
agree
but
maybe
the
jury
would,
then
the
interests
of
justice
probably
do
counsel
in
favor
of
giving
the
petitioner
a
new
trial,
and
this
is
how
all
of
the
courts,
except
for
the
ninth
and
tenth
circuits,
have
approached
the
issue.
the
ninth
and
tenth
circuits
have
concluded
that
an
instructional
error
like
this
is
structural
error.
we
don't
think
so.
we
think
that
a
structural
error
is
the
kind
of
error
that
affects
the
entire
integrity
of
the
proceedings
and
is
not
susceptible
to
harmless
error
analysis
at
all.
errors
that
relate
to
one
jury
instruction
in
a
trial
are
not
of
that
species.
this
court
has
held
that
over
and
over
again,
most
recently
in
california
v.
roy,
so
the
premise
that
this
error
is
structural
in
our
view
is
incorrect.
so
whatever
rule
the
court
might
think
would
be
appropriate
in
cases
of
true
structural
error
that
emerged
only
at
the
time
of
appeal,
this
case
is
not
that
case.
when
you
then
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
it
serves
the
interests
of
justice
to
give
petitioner
a
new
trial,
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
except
the
ninth
and
tenth
circuits
have
concluded
that
it
doesn't
if
there
really
was
no
case
to
be
made
on
the
issue
of
materiality
before
the
jury.
that
is
frequently
the
case,
because
the
issue
of
materiality
is
often
proved
up,
as
the
court
well
knows,
by
the
testimony
of
the
grand
jury
foreman
who
says,
we
were
looking
at
drug-dealing
and
money-laundering
by
this
person,
and
we
therefore
asked
these
questions
to
find
out
the
answers
to
those
things,
and
then
the
testimony
was
given,
and
now
the
jury
is
going
to
decide
whether
the
testimony
was
true
or
false.
materiality
is
not
the
centerpiece
of
most
of
these
cases.
occasionally,
there
is
a
case
in
which
materiality
is
hotly
contested,
and
a
court
of
appeals
might
feel
that
in
cases
where
there's
a
hot
contest
and
the
case
might
have
come
out
differently,
a
new
trial
is
in
order.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
honestly
do
not
think
it's
clear,
justice
kennedy,
what
the
trial
judge
thought
about
the
standard
that
he
applied
to
it.
the
eleventh
circuit
had
never
expressly
spoken
to
that
question.
before
this
court's
decision
in
gaudin,
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
except
the
ninth
circuit
said
materiality
is
a
legal
question.
some
courts
nonetheless
said
well,
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
decide
it
as
a
question
of
law.
other
courts--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--just
treated
it
as
a
question
that
got
decided
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
what
is
clear
from
this
trial
judge's
findings
is
that
he
reviewed
the
record,
he
understood
what
the
focus
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
was,
he
understood
why
it
was
relevant
to
the
grand
jury
to
know
the
source
of
funds
for
a
house
that
petitioner
purchased
potentially
with
laundered
drug
money
from
her
boyfriend,
said
all
of
that
on
the
record,
and
he
then
articulated
the
standard
in
what
i
think
is
the
correct
legal
standard
for
materiality.
he
said,
this
may
have
been
within
the
purview
of
what
the
grand
jury
was
investigating,
which
i
think
was
a
loose
fashion,
per
se.
this
was
reasonably
calculated
to
affect
the
decision
of
the
grand
jury.
petitioner,
of
course,
never
objected
in
the
trial
court
and
said,
oh,
no,
you're
applying
the
wrong
standard
of
materiality.
nor
did
petitioner
ever
say
you
haven't
found
it
to
the
requisite
degree
of
proof,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
real
question
that
the
trial
judge
was
firmly
convinced
that
this
false
testimony
was
material,
as
was
the
court
of
appeals.
so
our
final
submission
to
this
court
is
that
in
a
case
like
this
the
appropriate
response
is
to
apply
the
plain
error
rule
because
the
objection
was
not
preserved
at
trial,
to
treat
the
error
as
nonstructural
in
character,
to
examine
what
its
actual
impact
was--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--thank
you.
