but
the
judge
has
to
make
a
materiality
determination,
and
it's
relevant
to
the
judge's
determination.
you
don't
exclude
the
jury
while
the
judge
hears
the
materiality
evidence,
or
do
you?
maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
don't
think
you
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
be
frank,
i
guess
what's
troubling
us
is
that
if
you
had
a
really
strong
materiality
case
the
evidence
would
have
come
in
and
you
would
have
argued
it
either
before
the
judge
with
the
jury
absent
or
with
the
jury
present,
and
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
this
is
not
really
of
their
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
just
a
little
hard
for
us
to
grasp
the
plain
error
aspect,
reversible
error
aspect
in
this
case
when
we
didn't
think
the
materiality
was
at
question
either
before
the
judge
or
the
jury,
even
under
this
wall
of
precedent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
some
indication
in
the
record
that
the
trial
judge
might
have
not
have
applied
the
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
standard
to
materiality?
