justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
payments?
what
about
the...
perhaps
the
statute's
changed
so
much
that
i
don't
know
which
version
i'm
dealing
with,
and
so
i
might
just
be
referring
to
an
old
statute,
but
this...
the
words
i
have
in
the
red
brief
at
the
end
seem
to
talk
about
iv-d.
and
then
there's
something,
42
u.s.c.
64,
that
says
a
state
plan
for
child
and
spousal
support
must,
on
page
9a
it
says,
provide
that
amounts
collected
as
support
shall
be
distributed
as
provided
in
section
657,
and
then
section
657,
which
wasn't
actually
in
the
brief,
seems
to
have,
like,
eight
paragraphs
which
say
rather
specifically
who
gets
what
money,
and
then
it
seems
like
654(b)
says
the
state
disbursement
unit
shall
distribute
all
amounts
payable
under
657(a)
within
2
business
days.
so
it
seemed
like
there
was
a
lot
of
rather
specific
requirements
saying
exactly
how
many
dollars
different
people
would
receive,
some
of
them
being
afdc
people
and
some
of
them
being
non-afdc
people,
and
i
think
justice
o'connor's
original
question,
which
i
thought
justice
stevens
was
getting
at
too,
is
doesn't
at
least
that
part
of
the
statute
create
a
private
right,
or
create
a
1983
action
that
would
require
the
state
to
pay
the
money,
the
specific
dollars
that
it
must
pay
to
the
people
who
are
entitled
to
those
dollars?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
would
be
amazed
if
the
constitution
says
you
have
to
pay
within
2
business
days,
as
this
statute
does.
i
would
be
amazed
if
the
constitution
has
the
same
requirements
as
to
how
much
money
you
can
deduct
for
expenses
or
not
as
this
statute
does.
so
are
you
saying
that
this
statute
does
not
at
least
give
that
right,
the
right
that
the
very
specific
provisions
as
to
actual
dollars
that
the
state
would
have,
are
you
saying
that
this
statute
does
not
give
that
right
to
a
person
who
is
entitled
to
those
dollars?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
substantial
compliance,
you
realize.
my
question
is,
is
it
your
view
that
the
statute
does
not
give
that
right
to
those
very
dollars
with
the
specific
expense
deductions,
the
specific
time
periods,
to
the
particular
plaintiffs
who
are
entitled
to
those
dollars?
that
was
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
i
find
out
which
provisions
you're
talking
about?
my
particular
problem
is,
suppose
i
thought
that
some
of
these
provisions...
i
take
it
in
654,
where
there
are
24
listed
obligations,
suppose
i
thought
that
some
of
them
congress
did
mean
to
be
mandatory
in
the
sense
that
they
might
fall
within
1983,
but
others
of
them
congress
didn't.
what
should
i
do
here?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
parties
have
argued
it
out
provision
by
provision.
i
didn't
even
know
what
particular
provisions
you'd
be
talking
about
specifically,
so
what...
i'm
quite
puzzled.
if
i
thought
that
perhaps
some
but
not
others,
what's
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case,
and
how
do
i
know
which
are
which?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
mostly
said
regulations.
it
mostly
cited
reguations.
it
didn't
cite--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
which...
where
do
i
find
out
which
provisions
of
the
statute
you're
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
about...
i
just
have
one
question
in
this
case
which
stems
from
your
idea
that
some
of
these
are
enforceable
and
others
are
not.
that's
why
i
wanted
to
find
out
which
one
they're
talking
about,
and
they
say
they're
talking
about
654(4)
primarily,
and
if
i
look
at
that,
that
provision
says
that
the
state
has
to
promise
it
will
undertake
to
establish
the
paternity
of
the
child,
and
that
the
state
will
undertake
to
secure
support
for
the
child.
now,
those
are
the
two
provisions.
it
seems
to
me
those
are
awfully
vague
and
general.
so
now...
i'm
sure
that's
what
they'll
say.
i
want
to
know
what
is
it
that
leads
you
to
think
that
those
words
that
i
just
quote
are
meant
to
give
a
specifically
enforceable
right
to
an
individual?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
regs?
you
mean
you're
saying
the
regs
are
what
are
enforceable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i
got...
i
understand
your
point
now.
but
then
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
if
i
think
you
have
made
the...
i'm
not
sure
about
654(4)
and
i
don't
feel
they've
argued
that
specifically.
maybe
you
have.
but
what
do
i...
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
if
i
think
some
were
not
argued,
particularly
not
654(4),
with
enough
detail
for
me
to
decide?
some
you
may
be
right
on.
others
you
may
be
not.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
their
argument
will
be,
when
i
look
at
644(4)
and
look
at
all
the
regs,
i'll
discover
it's
very,
very
specific,
and
if
it
is?
