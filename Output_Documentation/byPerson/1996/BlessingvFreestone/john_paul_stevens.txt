justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't...
i
haven't
looked
at
pennhurst
recently,
but
wasn't
it
the
problem
in
pennhurst
that
the
state
didn't
know
for
sure
what
its
obligation
was,
not...
the
question
wasn't
whether
there
was
a
remedy
if
there
were
a
clear
obligation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here
you're
on
notice
about
what's
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
that
you
mean
you're
not
on
notice
as
to
whether
or
not
somebody
can
sue
you
if
you
fail
to
do
what's
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you're...
even
under
your
acknowledgement
you're
potentially
liable
to
18
million
individuals
if
you
don't
give
them
the
money
that's
coming
to
them.
you've
said
that
yourself,
but
you
say
they
just
have
to
sue
not
in
federal
court
but
in
state
court
for
their
own
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor
you
said
that
if
money
was
owing
to
a
particular
individual
they
could
sue
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
aren't
there
18
million
people
for
whom
that
could
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
follow
up
on
that
for
a
minute?
supposing
you
have
the
hypothetical
situation
justice
breyer
described.
you've
got
some
money
collected
there,
and
you're
in
substantial
compliance
with
the
statute.
you
have
that
money
sitting
there,
and
a
plaintiff
who
wanted
that
money
sued
you
in
state
court,
said
we
want
that
money
turned
over
to
us.
could
you
defend
on
the
ground
that
we
don't
have
to
because
we're
in
substantial
compliance
with
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
why
is
substantial
compliance
a
defense
to
a
federal
cause
of
action
if
it's
not
a
defense
to
a
state
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
did
title
to
that
money
pass
to
the
individual?
isn't
there
just
a
federal
duty
to
turn
over
an
amount
of
money
collected?
you
say
it
suddenly
became
the
idnvidual's
property.
