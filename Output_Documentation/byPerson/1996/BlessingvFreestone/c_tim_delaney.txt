mr.
c.
tim
delaney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
title
iv-d
pursuant
to
its
spending
clause
powers.
that
meant,
under
pennhurst,
that
congress
had
to
unambiguously
notify
the
states
of
any
consequences
of
their
accepting
federal
funds
so
that
the
states
could
make
an
informed
choice
about
whether
to
participate
in
that
program,
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
suter,
congress
could
provide
that
notice
to
the
states
by
unambiguously
conferring
rights
in
title
iv-d
that
would
be
privately
enforceable.
here,
congress
has
neither
unambiguously
conferred
any
rights
upon
respondents,
nor
unambiguously
notified
the
states
that
title
iv-d
can
be
enforced
privately
by
over
18
million
title
iv-d
applicants.
indeed,
title
iv-d
says
just
the
opposite,
because
when
congress
offered
the
title
iv-d
partnership
agreement
to
the
states,
it
unambiguously
deposited
all
enforcement
authority
in
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
congress
told
the
states
unambiguously
that
the
secretary
would
enforce
title
iv-d,
that
the
secretary
would
apply
a
substantial
compliance
standard
on
a
systemwide
basis
rather
than
an
individual
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
justice
o'connor,
that
is
an
important
difference
here
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
once
the
state
actually
receives
the
money,
then
the
individuals
would
have
a
right,
a
property
interest
in
getting
that
money
if
the
state
is
wrongfully
withholding
it,
but
that
is
not
a
statutory
right.
that
then
becomes
a
constitutional
right
in
their
property.
they
don't
need
to
move
forward--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--no,
ma'am,
not
through
the
title
iv-d
itself.
as
we
envision
title
iv-d,
it's
a
funding
mechanism.
the
states
gave
up
some
of
its
rights
in
terms
of
domestic
relations
to
the
federal
government
in
exchange
for
the
money,
so
it's
a
contract
between
the
sovereign
interests,
and
what's
happening
here
is
we
have
the
federal
government
coming
in
and
trying
to
run
part
of
the
program.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
no.
this
was
a
very
broad--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--we
have
raised
those--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--we
did
not
specifically,
but
we
think
that
they
are
subsumed
within
the
question
presented,
and--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--yes,
ma'am,
and
indeed
the
respondents,
when
they
opposed
our
cert
petition,
said
that
we
were
doing
just
that,
and
that
our
petition
loudly
echoed
that
type
of
activity,
and
they
have
fully
briefed
the
case.
we
think
that
this
case
presents
an
excellent
vehicle
for
the
court
to
reexamine
maine
v.
thiboutot,
but
we
don't
come
here
today
saying
that
that's
the
only
way
we
can
win.
we
can
set
that
argument
aside,
and
we
win
on
the
fact
that
title
iv-d
does
not
unamiguously
notify
the
states
that
there
is
any
enforceable
right
in--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--we
believe
that
there
would
be
a
claim
under
either
state
law
grounds
or
constitutional
grounds
in
the
property
interest.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
no,
ma'am,
it
would
not
be
enforceable
under
title
iv-d,
because
title
iv-d
again
is
a
funding
mechanism,
and
it's
a
funding
relationship,
and
in
order
for
the
court...
or
in
order
for
the
parents
to
come
in
and
say
that
they
have
an
enforceable
right,
we
need
to
make
sure
that
they
have
one.
here,
there
is
no
conferral
of
that
right.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
and...
correct,
and
in
terms
of
the
substantial
compliance
standard
that
congress
has
laid
out
in
title
iv-d,
again
that
gets
back
to
the
funding
mechanism,
when
you
have
this
funding
relationship
and
congress
says
in
order
to
continue
getting
funds
you
have
to
perform
at
a
substantial
compliance
standard
on
a
system-wide
basis.
and
it
used
to
be
when
iv-d
was
first
enacted
that
it
was
full
compliance
in
1975,
and
it
continued
that
way
until
1984,
and
congress
saw
that
no
state
had
ever
been
able
to
comply
at
a
full
compliance
standard,
so
congress
ratcheted
it
down
from
full
compliance
down
to
substantial
compliance,
and
in
the
process
notified
the
states
that
you
didn't
have
to
deliver
service
in
each
and
every
case,
and
that's
the
way
that
the
secretary
also
enforces
it.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
well,
in
fact
we
think
that
it
does
follow
that
way,
your
honor,
because
congress
has
developed
a
very
comprehensive
scheme
in
title
iv-d.
you
mentioned
the
fact
that
we
would
be
losing
title
iv-a
funds.
the
rationale
there
is
congress
wanted
to
have
title
iv-d
operating
full
bore,
at
full
speed,
doing
all
that
it
could
for
the
masses
that
it
was
designed
to
try
to
take
care
of,
and
in
the
process
of
then
pulling
off
on
an
individual
case-by-case
basis
various
lawsuits
we're...
again,
we
have
over
18
million
title
iv-d
applicants
across
the
nation,
and
it
will
cripple
the
program
if
you
allow
these
individuals
to
then
come
in
and
try
to
enforce
this
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
was--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--it
would
radically
change,
your
honor...
just
as
you
are
suggesting
it
was
radically
change
the
agreement
that
we
had
entered
into
with
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
came
in
and
told
us
again
that
we
would
have
to
comply
on
a
substantial
compliance
standard
on
a
system-wide
basis,
that
if
we
didn't
we
would
have
liquidated
damages
in
the
form
of
specific
liquidated
penalties
against
us,
but
again
they
would
be
assessed
against
title
iv-a
as
opposed
to
title
iv-d.
we
were
told
that
the
secretary
would
then
have
the
discretion
to
waive
those
liquidated
damages
when
appropriate,
and
we
could
then
go
in
and
negotiate
with
the
secretary.
there
were
other
mechanisms
available
for
us
to
go
in
and
in
essence
say,
this
isn't
the
time
to
be
enforcing
the
terms
this
rigorously.
but
again,
we
were
told
that
we
had
an
agreement,
and
it
was
given
to
us
in
very
unambiguous
terms
exactly
how
it
would
be
enforced.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
your
honor,
in
fact
the
secretary
has
found
that
arizona
is
in
substantial
compliance.
in
1984
she
came
out--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--correct.
arizona
has
not
had
anything
withheld
beyond
the...
it
was
almost
$1
million.
we
did
have
that
penalty
assessed
against
us
in
the
early
nineties.
in
terms--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--in
terms
of
justice
o'connor's
statement
arizona
has
done
an
abysmal
job,
as
the
complaint
lays
out,
in
1988
maricopa
county,
with
no
notice
to
the
state,
bailed
out
of
the
title
iv-d
program,
and
it
dumped
over
two-thirds
of
all
of
the
cases
in
title
iv-d
upon
the
state.
the
state
then
had
to
scramble
to
try
to
start
meeting
those
obligations.
and
then
in
1991...
again,
the
secretary
then
came
out
and
found
that
we
were
out
of
substantial
compliance,
did
the
audit,
and
then
was
coming
in
annually
to
do
new
audits
to
see
where
we
were,
did
assess
penalties
of
almost
a
million
dollars,
and
then
found
under
a
subsequent
audit
than
arizona
has
now
achieved
substantial
compliance.
and,
indeed,
as
we
lay
out
in
some
of
our
briefing
materials,
arizona's
now
receiving
national
awards,
and
it's
the
number
one
state
in
terms
of
improvements
for
collections
over
the
last
4
years,
so
arizona
has
turned
things
around
and
in
large
part
because
of
the
comprehensive
mechanism
that
congress
has
laid
out,
which
is
to
get
our
attention,
and
it
did
when
we
got
that
million-dollar
penalty
assessed
against
us,
but
then
to--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--no,
sir,
not
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
your
honor,
that
was
actually
a
letter
in
1994
based
on
the
latest
audit,
that
arizona
is
in
substantial
compliance.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
it
was
based
on
a
1992
audit,
and
no,
there
is
not
a
subsequent
audit
that
has
taken
place.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
if
it
was
that
specific
in
the
statute,
yes,
but
it
is
not
in
this
particular
statute,
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
mechanisms
that
i've
already
identified
showing
that
it
is
not.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
we
believe
that
that
is
what
is
required
under
this
court's
decisions
in
suter,
and
in
pennhurst,
that
in
the
spending
clause
context
the
states
have
to
be
put
on
notice
what
the
consequences
of
their
agreement
or--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--yes,
sir.
that
is
our
position,
that
it
does
need
to
be
spelled
out
within
the
confines
of
the
funding
mechanism
statute
so
that
the
states
are
on
notice
what
it
is
that
they're
going
to
be
exposed
to.
and
again,
the
problem
that
we
face
as
states
is
that
there
are
two
different
lines
of
authority
out
there.
we
have
the
pennhurst-suter
line
that
talks
in
terms
of
the
spending
clause
and
the
fact
that
there
are
significant
federalism
concerns
here
when
you
have
contracts
between
two
different
sovereigns,
and
then
we
have
the
wright-wilder
case,
line
of
cases
that
suggest
to
the
contrary.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
they...
the
problem
there
was
that
the
states
were
not
on
notice
what
was
required.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
right.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
no.
we're
not
on
notice
about
what
the
consequences
are.
we
would
put--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--yes,
sir,
and
we
believe
that
is
a
very
significant
difference,
because
if
we're
being
told
that
we're
going
to
be
penalized
by
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
alone,
then
we
can
deal
with
that,
but
to
then
have
18
million
different
individuals
who
can
then
walk
in
and
demand
enforcement
is
something
completely
different.
we
were
never
told
that
they
had
enforceable
rights.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
if
i
did,
your
honor,
i
misspoke.
these
individuals
do
not
have
any
enforceable
rights.
our
contract
is
with
the
federal
government.
our
obligations
flow
to
the
secretary.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
but
that's
different.
when
there's
money
that
we
have
actually
received
from
a
third
party
and
we
are
holding
that
money,
then--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--if
we
are
able
to
collect,
but
again,
nation-wide
the
collection
rate
is
only
18
percent
because
of
the
significant
problems
in
child
support
enforcement.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
we
don't
believe
they
could
under
title
iv-d,
no,
sir.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
if
arizona
withheld
the...
if
we
collected
the
moneys?
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
no,
sir.
no.
no
longer,
because
in
the
1996
reconciliation
act--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--under
the
prior
afdc
scheme
i
believe
so,
under
thiboutot,
but
that
is
different
than
our
scheme,
where
we
have
this
agreement.
again,
it's
a
funding
mechanism,
and
there's
not
direct
dollars--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--justice
souter,
i'm
not
as
familiar
with
the
afdc
case
law
or
statute,
just
as
you
are
not,
but
the
significant
difference
is
that--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--we're
evenly
matched.
[laughter]
i
wish
that
were
the
case.
in--
in
terms
of
the
difference,
though,
there
is
a
very
significant
difference.
in
title
iv-a
with
afdc,
under
the
old
system
you
had
direct
dollars,
they
were
quantifiable,
that
if
you
went
through
and
you
met
the
specific
standards
of
the
day
you
could
then
have
an
entitlement
to
that.
under
title
iv-d
you're
talking
about
services,
not
dollars.
you're
talking
about
something
that's
not
quantifiable,
something
that
is
much
more
amorphous,
and
in
title
iv-d
the
difference
is
instead
of
having
a
direct
one-on-one
relationship,
we
as
the
state
have
to
go
out
and
try
to
locate
an
absent
parent,
have
to
establish
paternity
for
joe
or
john
or
paul
or
ringo,
who
may
be
in
various
different
states,
so
we
have
to
issue
subpoenas
to
try
to
track
them
down.
it's
a
very
different--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--and
a
lot
of
that
falls
back,
your
honor,
to
the
issue
of
what
the
states
were
told,
and
we
were
told
that
we
would
have
to
substantially
comply
in
order
to
get
our
funds,
and--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
way
of
looking
at
us,
at
our
argument,
which
is
we
were
told
that
we
wouldn't
have
to
do
it
on
a
comprehensive
system,
and
we
were
told
not
only
in...
with...
in
terms
of
substantial
compliance.
we
were
told
in
section
658,
that
would
then
reward
us
with
incentives
if
we
did
better
than
had
been
anticipated.
as
the
court
found
in
pennhurst,
the
fact
that
there
are
incentives
show
that
there
cannot
be
any
mandatory
obligations.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
there
is
nothing
in
iv-d
that--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--again,
that's
different
than
what
we--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--right,
and
again
the
key
phrase
there
is
a
benefit
program.
that
is
different
than
title
iv-d,
which
is...
concerns
services
that
the
state
is
providing
based
on
an
agreement
that
we
have
with
the
federal
government.
and
it's
different
because
again
on...
we're
being
told
that
we're
going
to
be
measured
with
substantial
compliance,
with
incentives,
with
the
paternity
establishment,
for
example,
and
the
statute
itself
says
that
we
will
comply
if
we
get
anywhere
between
45
and
90
percent
establishment
of
paternity.
that's
not
100
percent.
we're
not
being
told
by
our
federal
partner
in
this
that
we
have
to
reach
100
percent
anywhere.
we're
being
told--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--your
honor,
if
we
have
actually
received
the
moneys
and
we're
holding
the
moneys
and
we
don't
distribute,
then
yes,
we
could
be
sued
if
we're
wrongfully
withholding
it,
but
we
could
be
sued
not
under
title--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--your
honor,
in
terms...
getting
back
to
substantial
compliance,
or
whether
we
have
been
in
substantial
compliance,
we
don't
know
yet--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--at
first
glance,
yes.
however,
getting
back
to
substantial
compliance,
the
secretary
will
be
promulgating
regulations
saying
how
she
is
going
to
measure
substantial
compliance.
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
statute
that
talks
about
having
to
do
certain
things.
the
secretary
has
promulgated
regulations
and
said
that
those
time
lines
can
be
waived,
those
time
lines
can
be
treated
differently
if
you
collect
the
moneys
within
the
audit
period,
and
so
the
whole
substantial
compliance
thing
does
come
back
in
in
terms
of
measuring
whether
there
would
be
an
individual
right
there
or
not,
and--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--no,
your
honor.
again,
if
we
actually
had
the
money,
i
don't
think
that
we
could.
i
think
that
we
would
have
to--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--the
chief
concern
we
have...
and
again,
this
whole
line
of
questions
has
gone
off
on
the
issue
of
actually
holding
the
moneys,
and
we
think
that
that's
a
different
situation
because
we
actually
have
property
that
we
are
holding
of
someone
else's.
that's
distinguishable
from
the
broad
range
of
the
rest
of
title
iv-d.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
exactly,
and--
mr.
c.

--well,
actually,
it's
done
pursuant
to
a
court
order,
and
the
court
order
tells
the
individual
that
they
have
to
pay.
then
the
state
is
sitting
there
as
a
repository,
so
it's
really
just
enforcing
that
current
court
order,
that
we
are
then
holding
that
individual's
money,
that
we
then
turn
it
over.
mr.
c.

sweeping
relief,
in
that
they
asked
for
an
order
that
arizona
be
ordered
to
achieve
as
well
as
sustain
substantial
compliance.
again,
the
secretary
has
already
found
that
we
are
in
substantial
compliance.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
no.
no,
it
was
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it
had
to
do
with
much
more
broader
scope,
saying
that
we
have
to
be
held
in
substantial
compliance,
and
again
the
secretary
has
already
found
that
we're
in
substantial
compliance,
and
the
secretary's
brief
today
tells
us
that
that
is
not
a
right
that
the
individuals
can
be
enforcing.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
just
three
quick
points.
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
ms.
berzon
was
talking
about
looking
at
the
substance
of
the
complaint.
if
you
look
at
paragraph
132(t),
they
complain
about
the
extraordinary
staff
personnel
shortages
as
the
paramount
cause
of
noncompliance
with
iv-d
requirements.
then
at
133,
paragraph
133,
they
complain
that
linda
blessing
lacks
the
authority
to
direct
the
legal
work
of
the
ag's
office,
and
at
134
they
complain
about
the
fact
that
title
iv-d
at
the
state
level
incurs
problems
with
clerks
in
the
superior
court.
what
they're
asking
for
here
is
not
a
structural
injunction.
they're
asking
for
a
restructural
injunction
because
they
want
a
federal
judge
to
come
in
and
tell
arizona
how
to
redo
its
state
government
activities,
and
as
the
sg's
representative
just
said,
you
need
to
sue
the
person
who
can
grant
the
relief.
linda
blessing
cannot
redo
what
the
arizona
legislature's
budgetary
concerns
are.
linda
blessing
cannot
go
out
and
reconfigure
the
lines
of
arizona
state
government
so
that
she
can
control
the
ag's
office,
and
she
cannot
go
out
and
rewrite
arizona
government
in
terms
of
having
to
make
the
counties
comply.
so
it
really
boils
down
to,
what's
a
federal
court
going
to
do
here?
is
it
going
to
duplicate
what
the
secretary's
done,
or
will
it
be
imposing
new
duties
beyond
whatever
the
congress
has
passed?
my
second
point
gets
to
one
that
justices
breyer
and
ginsburg
have
raised,
which
is,
how
do
i
know
which
are
which?
the
sg
has
just
told
us,
well,
we
can
look
at
them
provision
by
provision,
and
some
are
and
some
aren't.
we
have
to
guess
and
hope
that
we
come
up
with
the
answer.
we
believe
that
the
constitution
says
otherwise.
the
spending
clause
as
this
court
has
interpreted
says
that
the
states
have
to
know
unambiguously
what
is
enforceable
and
what
is
not.
we
have
to
know
in
advance
so
that
we
can
make
the
determination
whether
we
want
to
accept
this
agreement
or
not,
and
the
constitution
requires
that
it
be
spelled
out
by
congress
and
not
by
judges
who
have
to
guess
which
ones
are--
mr.
c.
tim
delaney
--again,
we
think
that
that
should
be
something
that
they
do
across
the
street
rather
than
out
at
the
various
district
courts
or
even
at
state
courts
to
be
guessing,
well,
this
one
looks
like
it
is,
and
this
one
looks
like
it
isn't.
instead
of
having
a
nation-wide
uniform
system
we're
going
to
wind
up
with
a
judge
in
phoenix
looking
at
something
different
than
one
in
massachusetts
and
saying
that
the
same
provision
is
or
is
not
enforceable.
congress
should
be
doing
that.
and
my
final
point,
just
racing
through
here,
justice
ginsburg,
you
had
asked
a
question
about
the--
