justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
point
is
it
wasn't
the
deal,
that
the
states
when
they
went
in
thought
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
make
a
good
faith
effort
and
achieve
substantial
compliance.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
have
to
achieve
total
compliance,
at
least
insofar
as
being
liable
to
individual
suits
is
concerned,
it's
quite
a
different
program
they're
buying.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
complaint
would
not
argue
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
any
obligation
under
the
act.
the
complaint
would
simply
say,
you
have
my
money,
right?
it's
a
state
law
cause
of
action
for
money
improperly
withheld.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
berzon,
i'm
happy
to
talk
about
the
individual
rights
rather
than
the
whole
program.
suppose
you
have
a
federal
statute
that,
let's
say,
provides
for
broadcast
licenses,
and
the
claim
is
that
the
license
has
been
improperly
denied.
the
personsuing
under
1983,
however,
is
not
the
person
who
would
have
gotten
the
license,
but
rather
a
hot
dog
stand
across
the
street
from
the
person
who
would
have
gotten
the
license,
who
claims
that
he
lost
a
lot
of
business,
that
had
the
license
been
issued
here,
there
would
have
been
a
lot
more
traffic
and
so
forth.
would
that
person
have
a
cause
of
action
under
1983?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait.
so
you
acknowledge
that
some
exercise
must
be
indulged
in
in
deciding
what
is
a
right,
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities.
not
everyone
who
is
adversely
affected
by
the
failure
to
act
has
a
right,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
we
ask
the
question
here,
when
1983
was
enacted,
would
these
people
be
deemed
to
have
rights?
now,
a
brief
by
an
amicus
suggests
that
at
the
time
1983
was
enacted,
under
contract
law
third
party
beneficiaries
of
a
contract
between
two
people
would
not
be
able
to
sue
in
order
to
enforce
the
rights
promised
to
the
third
party
beneficiary,
and
that's
the
situation
you
have
here.
it's
a
contract
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
the
states
agree
as
part
of
that
contract
to
render
certain
benefits,
services
to
your
clients.
your
clients
are
suing
as
third
party
beneficiaries.
as
i
read
the
law
at
the
time
of
1983,
third
party
beneficiaries
had
no
right,
no
right
to
sue,
just
like
the
hot
dog
stand
owner
wouldn't
have
any
right
to
sue
today.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
argument
made
in
those
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
argument
made
and
rejected
in
those
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
not
some
consideration--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
there
not
some
consideration
coming
from
the
third
party
beneficiary
in
some
of
those
casess?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
think
that's
more
draconian
than
the
relief
you
ask
for
in
this
complaint?
i
mean,
i'm
not...
if
i
were
the
state
administrator
i'm
not
sure
that
the
cutting...
that
the
monetary
penalty
from
the
federal
government,
or
the
cutting
off
of
federal
government
funds,
would
be
any
worse
than
being
subjected
to
a
suit
that
demands,
in
effect,
every
individual
get
what
the
act
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
just
questioning
your
assertion
that
the
substantial
compliance
provision
only
applies
to
some
draconian
relief.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
insist
that
the
state
comply
with
every
jot
and
tiddle
of
this
law
with
respect
to
every
person
who
is
benefited
by
the
contract
with
the
federal
government
is
itself
pretty
draconian.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said,
ms.
berzon,
as
the
statute
requires.
technically
the
statute
here
doesn't
require
anything,
does
it,
unless
the
state
enters
into
a
contract.
the
state
says...
what
it
says
is,
if
you
agree
to
do
this,
the
federal
government
agrees
to
do
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
has
agreed,
so
the
issue
is
whether
the
state's
breaking
its
word
with
the
federal
government
gives
the
right
to
people
who
are
not
parties
to
that
contract
to
come
in
and
complain
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
agree
that
it's
been--
--were
those
class
actions?
was
rosado
a
class
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
hasn't
said
that.
it's
not
really
a
right.
if
the
state
had
chosen
not
to
go
into
this
program
nobody
would
have
any
rights
to
anything
here.
if
there
is
any
entitlement
to
it,
it
is
through
the
contract
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
too
misleading
to
refer
to
it
casually
as
a
right.
it
may
be
a
right,
or
it
may
not
be
a
right,
and
that's
part
of
the
issue.
it
arises
out
of
this
contract,
and
that's
what
makes
it
difficult
to
decide
these
government
grant
and
benefit
program
cases,
as
distinguished
from
those
cases
in
which
the
federal
government
does
create
rights.
automatically
it
says
the
states
must
do
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
have
a
1983
right,
and
it's
easy
to
talk
cavalierly
about
rights,
but
every
time
you
say
right,
i...
you
know,
i
think
that's
really
what's
at
issue
here.
