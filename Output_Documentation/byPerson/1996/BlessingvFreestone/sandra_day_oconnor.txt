justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
was
sought
here
in
the
complaint
was
something
based
on
the
substantial
compliance
requirement,
was
it
not,
in
the
complaint?
this
was
a
broad
complaint.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are,
however,
some
provisions
in
the
statute
here
that
are
very
specific.
for
instance,
provisions
that
for,
if
the
state
is
going
to
collect
money
for
non-afdc
parents,
that
it
will
pay
the
money
over
to
those
parents
very
specifically
and
within
certain
time
limits.
now,
that's
a
pretty
specific
requirement,
is
it
not?
do
you
say
that
no
parent
for
whom
the
state
has
collected
money
under
that
provision
would
have
a
right
to
ask
the
state
to
pay
it
over
if
it
were
withheld?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
might
also
be
a
statutory
right.
in
any
event,
you
would
find
at
least
some
provisions
are
specific
enough
that
by
some
route
they
could
be
enforced,
would
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
some
of
the
specific
provisions
might
well
fall
within
cases
that
we
have
decided
previously
giving
individuals
some
rights,
but
this
complaint
was
not
based
on
any
such
specific
request,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
arizona's
brief
here
you
seem
to
want
us
to
address
some
other
issues
like
the
overruling
of
maine
v.
thiboutot,
and
some
eleventh
amendment
arguments
that
were
not
raised
in
the
cert
petition.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
should
we
get
into
those?
i
mean,
you
didn't
come
here
with
cert
petition
questions
identifying
those.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
fairly
subsumed,
so
that
people
all
around
the
country
would
understand
you
were
going
to
be
here
arguing
the
overruling
of
maine
v.
thiboutot.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
federal
government
has
not
yet
suspended
arizona
from
the
benefits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
a
surprising
finding,
in
light
of
arizona's
recalcitrance
in
carrying
out
its
program
and
its
apparent
inability
to
handle
these
matters.
i
mean,
it
has
been
a
dismal
sort
of
a
performance
there
in
arizona,
but
nonetheless,
the
federal
government
has
not
withdrawn
the
funding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
it
didn't
say
that
at
all.
it
went
on
to
ask
for
grant
permanent
and
as
necessary
and
appropriate
interlocutory
injunctions--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--prohibiting
continued
adherence
to
the
aforesaid
pattern
and
practices,
and
requiring
affirmative
measures
sufficient
to
achieve
as
well
as
sustain
substantial
compliance
with
federal
law
throughout
all
programmatic
operations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
this
case
looks
to
me
very
much,
frankly,
as
though
the
respondents
were
just
asking
the
federal
court
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
secretary
at
the
federal
level
and
compel
substantial
compliance
with
the
act,
just
as
the
secretary's
obligation
would
be,
and
to
have
the
federal
court
take
over
the
entire
administration
of
this
iv-d
act,
and
i
never
read
that
act
as
contemplating
such
a
broad
role
for
the
federal
court--
now,
that's
not
to
say
there
may
not
be
certain
individual
provisions
in
the
act
that
are
specific
enough
that
could
require
enforcement,
as
has
been
discussed
already,
but
the
notion
that
the
federal
court
could
be
asked
to
come
in
and
just
take
over
the
whole
idea
of
whether
there
is
substantial
compliance
in
all
its
details,
supervise
it,
struck
me
as
going
beyond
any
case
that
this
case
had
ever
handed
down.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
reply
by
whom?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whose
reply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
arizona's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
there
may
be
very
few
socalled
privately
enforceable
rights
here
because
the
statutory
scheme
is
one
that
essentially
wants
the
states
to
be
involved
in
a
program
to
substantially
carry
out
the
federal
vision,
and
to
be
involved
in
substantially
trying
to
help
people
collect
child
support,
but
clearly
it's
not
going
to
be
effective
in
every
case.
there
are
deadbeats
who
are
never
going
to
be
located
or
who
don't
have
the
money.
you
can't
squeeze
blood
out
of
a
turnip,
and
you've
never
going
to
get
it,
and
congress
surely
didn't
contemplate
here
that
for
most
of
these
provisions
that
there
are
individual
rights
which
the
statute
never
contemplated
the
state
would
be
required
to
carry
out
in
every
single
case.
it
was
seeking
broadly
substantial
compliance.
there
may
be
some
individual
exceptions
within
the
act,
such
as
where
money
has
in
fact
been
collected
and
not
paid
over,
but
i
think
those
might
be
few
and
far
between.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
arizona
has
chosen
to
participate
in
a
federally
funded
welfare
program,
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
as
a
condition
of
receiving
that
federal
funding,
a
federal
statute
known
as
title
iv-d
requires
arizona
to
help
children
and
single
parents
obtain
paternity
determinations
and
child
support
orders
and
to
collect
support
payments
from
absent
parents.
this
lawsuit
was
brought
by
five
single
mothers
living
in
arizona
whose
children
were
not
receiving
child
support
from
their
absent
fathers.
the
mothers
sued
the
director
of
arizona’s
child
support
agency,
claiming
that
the
agency
had
not
provided
them
with
child
support
services,
and
that
the
state’s
failure
were
largely
attributable
to
structural
defects
in
the
state
agency;
staff
shortages,
high
case
loads,
and
poor
record
keeping.
they
brought
their
lawsuit
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983
which
imposes
liability
on
anyone
who
under
color
of
state
law,
deprives
the
person
of
any
rights,
privileges,
or
immunity
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
mothers
claimed
that
title
iv-d
gave
them
rights
and
asked
the
court
to
order
arizona
to
achieve
substantial
compliance
with
federal
law
through
all
of
its
programmatic
operations.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
director
but
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
title
iv-d
gave
the
mothers
an
individual
right
to
have
arizona’s
child
support
agency
substantially
comply
with
federal
guidelines,
and
that
the
secretary’s
authority
to
audit
and
cut
funding
of
the
agency
did
not
foreclose
an
individual
remedy
for
the
plaintiffs
under
section
1983.
we
disagree
with
the
first
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals’
analysis
and
therefore
vacate
the
judgment.
we
disagree
with
the
lower
court’s
conclusion,
the
ninth
circuit’s
conclusion,
that
individuals
have
a
right
to
have
arizona’s
child
support
agency
substantially
comply
with
title
iv-d.
for
a
statute
to
create
an
enforceable
right
for
individual
plaintiffs
that
must
be
intended
to
benefit
the
plaintiff
and
must
create
judicially
manageable
standards
and
impose
a
binding
obligation
on
the
state.
the
requirement
that
a
state
be
in
substantial
compliance,
we
think,
is
not
intended
to
benefit
particular
individuals.
the
substantial
compliance
standard
requires
that
a
state
must
provide
certain
services
only
in
a
specified
percentage
of
cases.
for
example,
a
state
must
collect
over
due
support
payments
in
75%
of
state
cases,
and
that
numerical
target
is
a
system
wide
measure
of
performance
triggering
the
secretary’s
auditing
and
penalty
provisions.
it
does
not
give
particular
individuals
an
enforceable
right
to
receive
child
support
services.
we
also
think
the
court
of
appeals
painted
with
too
broad
a
brush
in
holding
that
title
iv-d
created
unspecified
rights.
our
cases
have
always
analyzed
the
plaintiffs'
asserted
right
in
their
most
concrete
specific
form.
we
send
this
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
construe
the
complaint
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
exactly
what
right,
considered
in
their
most
concrete
specific
form
the
mothers
are
asserting.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
kennedy.
