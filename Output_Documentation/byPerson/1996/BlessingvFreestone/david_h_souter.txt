justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
notified
the
states
that
it
wouldn't
take
its
enforcement
measures
such
as
reducing,
what
is
it,
the
iv-a
money
or
whatever,
as
a
result
of
something
less
than
a
failure,
or
substantial
compliance,
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
there
is
no
individual
right
if
in
a
particular
case
there
is
individual
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
i
assume
correctly
that
you
would
agree
that
if
the
agreement
between
the
national
government
and
the
state
of
arizona,
it
had
a
clause
in
it
providing
that
maine
v.
thiboutot
would
be
applicable
in
the
relationship
between
arizona
and
the
welfare
recipients,
that
then
the
agreement
would
be
sufficiently
unambiguous
and
they
would
have
the
private
rights
of
action
to
compel
your
enforcement,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
also
take
the
position
that,
regardless
of
how
clear
the
general
law
might
be...
for
example,
maine
v.
thiboutot
law...
indicating
that
the
welfare
recipients
would
have
an
action
for
enforcement,
that
still
there
would
be
no
action
cognizable
unless
the
agreement
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
expressly
referred
to
that
unambiguous
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
the
notice
must
be
within
the
four
corners
of
the
agreement.
the
notice
cannot
be
notice
by
virtue
of
general
but
unambiguous
law
if
it
is
not
specifically
referred
to
in
the
agreement.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
apart
from...
let's
leave
aside
the
question
of
the
collection
activity
that
we're
talking
about.
what
if
the
state
of
arizona
simply
withheld,
under
the
prior
afdc
scheme
simply
withheld
a
payment
due?
could
the
individual
bring
a
claim
for
that
payment?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
would
they
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
afdc
formula
is,
but
whatever
the
afdc
formula
is,
if
there
were
a
single
parent
with
two
children,
and
they
were
entitled
to
x
dollars
a
month,
and
the
state
did
not
distribute
the
x
dollars,
could
the
parent
and
the
children
bring
a
claim
against
the
state
for
the
money?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i...
under
the
prior
afdc
scheme.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what
is
there...
i'm
sorry,
but
what
is
there
in
the
afdc
law
or
in
the
agreement
between
the
state
and
the
national
government
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
the
afdc
scheme
that
gives
them,
or
perhaps
in
your
terms
puts
the
state
on
clear
notice
that
the
individual
recipients
could
bring
an
individual
claim
for
the
money
in
the
case
that
i
posit,
which
is
not
present
with
respect
to
the
action
before
us
here?
what
in
the
agreement
is
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
evenly
matched.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
might
very
well
go
to
the
question
whether
you
had
fulfilled
your
obligation
in
an
individual
instance
to
try
to
collect,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
would
support
a
distinction
in
principle
between
the
two
cases.
take
an
example...
in
fact,
i
guess
it's
already
been
mentioned...
in
which
the
parent
with
the
support
responsibility
is
more
or
less
standing
on
the
sidewalk
outside
the
state
welfare
office.
all
they've
got
to
do
is
serve
him
with
a
document
and
haul
him
into
court,
and
the
state
simply
says,
we
don't
want
to.
we're
busy.
we
have
other
things
to
do.
there,
it
seems
to
me
the
state's
obligation
is
just
as
clear
and
definite
as
it
is
in
the
instance
of
the
obligation
to
pay
money,
and
i'm
having
difficulty
drawing
the
distinction
in
principle
between
those
two
sets
of
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
think
you're
saying...
i'm
sorry,
but
may
i
interrupt
you
with
this
question:
i
think
you're
saying
not
so
much
that
you
weren't
put
on
notice
that
you
would
have
this
obligation,
but
that
the
substantial
compliance
requirement
in
effect
puts
you
on
notice
that
you
didn't
have
it.
in
other
words,
i
think
you're
arguing
that
the
substantial
compliance
condition
says,
we
don't
worry
about
individual
cases.
your
only
obligation
is
an
obligation
in
the
mass,
as
it
were.
is
that
your
argument,
that
it's
kind
of
like
a
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
you
spoke
of
general
equitable
principles
of
relief
applying,
and
i
guess
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
they
necessarily
would,
at
least
i
think
in
the
way
you
intended,
because
in
the
usual
class
action
case
i
think
the
assumption
that
we
make
going
into
court
is
that
there
is
no
one
in
effect
who
is
going
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
class
except
these
particular
plaintiffs
who
are
suing
on
behalf
of
the
class.
but
that's
not
so
in
a
case
like
this,
because
here
we
have
a
federal
agency
which
presumably
is
in
business
to
do
precisely
what
the
class
relief
is
requesting,
and
that
is
to
look
at
the
big
picture
and
to
sort
of
take
the
mega
enforcement
action,
so
i
would
have
thought
that
even
on
general
equitable
principles
the
only
relief
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
court
to
decree
as
opposed
to
leaving
it
to
the
national
government
to
demand
would
be
the
specific
relief
of
those
who
claim
that
they
have
a
particular
entitlement
quite
apart
from
whatever
in
the
main
the
state's
failure
or
success
may
be,
which
is
the
business
of
the
national
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
shouldn't
we
draw
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
shouldn't
we
draw
the
distinction?
in
other
words,
why
should
a
court
in
effect
take
over
an
obligation
which
has
been
pretty
clearly
delineated
to
be
that
of
the
secretary
here,
as
opposed
to
doing
what
courts
usually
do
in
nonclass
action
cases
where
there's
nobody
to
act
on
behalf
of
a
class
if
the
court
and
the
plaintiffs
don't,
and
that
is
simply
to
provide
the
specific--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
1983
doesn't
say
anything
one
way
or
the
other.
1983
provides
in
effect
jurisdiction
to
provide
equitable
relief,
and
the
question
that
i'm
raising
is
really
one
of
equitable
relief
principles
and
that
is,
when
you
have
somebody
who
in
effect
can
do
the
work
of
the
class
action,
i.e.,
the
secretary,
why
should
a
court
do
anything
other
than
do
the
work
that
the
secretary
cannot
do
well?
