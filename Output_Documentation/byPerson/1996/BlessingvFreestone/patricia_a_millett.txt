ms.

millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
make
my
points,
i
would
like
to
clarify
arizona's
status
with
respect
to
substantial
compliance.
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
we
have
found
them
in
substantial
compliance
in
their
overall
operations.
the
1994
letter
to
which
justice
ginsburg
referred
states
only
that
we
have
found
them
in
substantial...
and
this
is
at
page
1
of
the
reply
to
the
cert
petition,
that
appendix.
the
program
has
achieved
substantial--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
sorry.
it's
the
reply
to...
the
cert
reply,
at
the
cert
stage,
appendix--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
reply
by
arizona.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
their
cert
petition
reply.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
they
filed...
the
reply
at
the
cert
page,
and
app
1...
at
app
1
the
letter
states
that
the
program
has
achieved
substantial
compliance
with
the
unmet
criteria
cited
in
our
march
1992
penalty
notice.
there's
no
broad
finding
of
substantial
compliance,
and
in
fact
we
have
not
made
that
yet.
we
do
not
know
what...
i'm
not
suggesting
this
has
happened
by
arizona.
we
don't
know.
as
i
said,
we
have
investigated,
but
it
would...
it's
not
uncommon
in
these
circumstances
for
agencies
to
focus
on...
state
agencies
to
focus
on
the
unmet
criteria,
and
then
that
takes
resources
away
from
another
one.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
parts
of
the
statute--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
certainly.
examples
of
the
types
of
things
we
just
don't
think
are
judicially
enforceable
at
all
because
they
don't
create
rights
are
some
of
the
sort
of
macroadministrative
mechanisms
under
the
statute,
things
such
as,
we
discussed
the
substantial
compliance
requirement,
which
is
just
a
penalty
provision
that
we
administer,
the
existence
of
a
computer
system
writ
large.
the
general
scheme
for
operating,
the
tools
for
operating
this
are
not
the
types
of
things
that
would
be
judicially
enforceable
because
they
do
not
run
to
individuals
as
rights.
specific
things
that
are
judicially
enforceable,
just
in
the
statute
itself...
the
regulations
we
think
creates
many,
many
more,
but
the
statute
itself
talks
about,
as
justice
o'connor
already
mentioned,
the
requirement
the
states
distribute
proceeds
collected
in
a
specific
manner
and
under
the
new
act
between
certain
specific
times
frames
is
a
specific
enforceable
right
that
runs
to
the
individual.
it's
their
money,
and
congress
has
said
you
have
a
right
to
get
it
in
a
certain
amount
of
time,
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--your--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
some--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--sometimes
congress
creates
things
that
are
recognized
as
rights
outside
the
contract
context,
such
as
a
clean
water
act,
a
clean
air
act,
that
don't
apply
to
states
until
they
choose
to
enter
into
an
activity
that
is
covered.
this
would
be
the
same
way.
yes,
if
no
one
gets
into
this
program,
although
all
50
states
are,
there
are
no
rights,
but
once
you
get
in
you
are
bound
by
the
federal
law
that
you
have
voluntarily
chosen
to
submit
to
and
been
paid
substantially
to
comply
with.
this
court's
decisions,
previous
decisions
involving
these
types
of
contract
cooperative
relationships
have
all
recognized
that
once
you're
in
we
can
decide
whether
or
not
the
federal
law
you
have
now
agreed
to
comply
with
creates
rights,
and
we
believe
that
to
underscore
this
with
respect
to
the
social
security
act,
congress
acted
after
this
court's
decision
in
suter
and
passed
42
u.s.c.
section
132a-2,
and
that
underscored
congress'
intent
that
under
1983
this
type
of
relationship,
once
it's
entered
into,
can
create
rights.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
your
honor,
we
would
disagree.
congress
wants
full
compliance.
the
fact
that
it
has
a
penalty
provision
in
iv-a
and
not
in
iv-d,
in
iv-a,
in
terms
of
substantial
compliance
is
no
different.
the
old
afdc
program
had
a
substantial
compliance
penalty
provision,
too.
they
concede
that
that
was
enforceable.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
think
that
the
secretary
and
the
united
states
generally
has
the
same
right
under
a
contract
as
any
other
party
to
seek
specific
performance--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
that
you
would
have...
a
plaintiff
would
have
serious
standing
problems
that
sound
a
lot
like
simon
v.
eastern
kentucky
welfare
rights
organization,
where
they
were
trying
to
sue
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
change
a
rule
which
would
then
require...
supposedly
require
hospitals
to
change
their
conduct
which
then
might
result
in
benefits
to
the
plaintiffs.
that
would
be
the
same
sort
of
attenuated
scenario.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
could
take
away
the
money.
as
a
second
tier
we
also
think
that
our
audit
and
penalty
things
are
committed
to
agency
discretion
so
there
would
be
a
second
problem
beyond
that,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
allow
a
court
to
determine--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right,
because
the
person
that...
because
what
they
want
is
services,
and
we
don't
deliver
the
services,
and
this
was
the
same
problem
again
in
simon.
you
need
to
sue
the
person
who
can
give
you
what
you
want,
to
make
it
very
simple.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
it's
those
words
in
combination
with
others.
we
don't
think
that
every
single
stage
of
paternity
or
support
services
is
enforceable.
you
have
to
look
at
the
statute
regs
and
see
if
it
spells
it
out.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
there's
statutory
provisions
and
regulations
both.
let
me...
i
can
give
you
a
couple
of
examples
of
statutory
provisions
in
the...
that
might
affect
these
plaintiffs.
first
of
all,
there's
the
distribution
one
that's
already
been
discussed.
section
654(8)
requires
that
when
someone
seeks
location
services--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--you
must
use
a
federal--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
believe
a
remand--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
believe
a
remand
would
be
appropriate.
thank
you.
