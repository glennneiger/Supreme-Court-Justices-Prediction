justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
delaney,
that
hasn't
been
the
approach
when
1983
is
there.
this
is
not
a
cort
v.
ash
case.
this
is
a
1983.
maine
v.
thiboutot
says
there
is
a
right
to
enforce
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
in
connection
with
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
you,
i
think
you
responded
that
there
would
be
a
claim...
suppose
the
state
collected
the
money
and
simply
didn't
turn
it
over.
you
acknowledge
there
would
be
such
a
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
a
case
where
the
parent
was
located,
the
noncustodial
parent,
and
had
a
job,
and
the
state
simply
refused
to
do
anything
about
a
wage
implementation
order?
would
that
also...
well,
would
it
be
enforceable
or
not
in
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
view
is
it's
either
all
or
nothing,
so
that
there's
no
claim
possible
under
iv-d
no
matter
how
specific?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
letter
that
said
in
1992
arizona
was
found
in
substantial
compliance.
has
there
been
anything
from
the
federal
government
since
then
evaluating
this
program's
compliance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
as
of
1992,
was
it
not,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
delaney,
in
comparing
the
two,
the
direct
benefit
to
the
iv-a
money,
isn't
there
something
like
for
social
security
benefits
that
there's
an
administrative
route
that
you
have
to
go
first,
and
then
if
you're
turned
down,
then
you
have
further
judicial
review?
is
there
nothing
like
that
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
in
iv-a...
i'm
trying
to
get
back
to
justice
souter's
question,
when
he
said
well,
what
if
you
were
entitled
to
afdc
benefits
and
the
state
didn't
pay
them,
under
the
old
regime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
seems
to
me
that
most
benefit
systems
like
that
you
have
to
make
an
application,
get
turned
down,
go
through
the
administrative
mill,
and
then
end
up
in
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
berzon,
there's
an
anomaly,
isn't
there,
in
that
at
least
the
government
is
insisting
that
substantial
compliance
is
none
of
the
business
of
the
beneficiaries.
that's
simply
between
the
secretary
and
the
state.
but
your
position
seems
to
be,
or
the
secretary's
position
seems
to
be
that
you
can
enforce
full
compliance.
seventy-five
percent
of
collections
won't
do.
you
can
insist
on
full
compliance.
doing
it
in
3
days
instead
of
2
days
won't
do.
now,
isn't...
how
does
one
rationalize
giving
the
beneficiaries
a
right
to
full
compliance
when
all
that
the
secretary
can
insist
on
is
substantial
compliance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
what
was
the
letter
following
the
audit
that
says
you
are
now
in
substantial
compliance
not
with
everything
in
the
world
but
with
iv-d?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
unfortunately
have
that
particular
brief
with
me,
but
i'm
fairly
certain
that
there
was
a
broad
statement
that
arizona...
we
are
pleased
to
tell
you
that
arizona
is
in
substantial
compliance
with
the
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
give
us
at
least
an
example
of,
if
you're
right
that
there
is
a
claim
that
there
is
a
private
right,
of
relief
that
would
be
beyond
question
within
the
ordinary
judicial
realm?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
does
a
judge--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
the
direction
would
then
be,
go
after
her
husband,
and
that
would
be
the
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about,
as
there
are
many
people
similarly
situated
and
we
can't
identify
them
all
because
we
don't
have
the
records,
go
after
all
defaulting
parents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
as
to
the
criterion,
the
government's
brief
said
something
about
three
different
kinds
of
provisions.
they
said,
there
are
some
that
are
not
judicially
enforceable
at
all,
some
that
are
judicially
enforceable,
and
some
that
are
not
judicially
enforceable
to
the
same
degree
as
others,
so
you
laid
out
those
three
categories
but
you
didn't
fill
any
of
them.
so
looking
at
this,
the
dozens
and
dozens
of
quite
specific
requirements,
how
does
a
court
say
which
ones
are
not
judicially
enforceable
at
all,
which
ones
are
fully
judicially
enforceable,
and
which
ones
are
judicially
enforceable
somewhat?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you've
looked
at
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
can
you
give--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--since
you
set
out
those
categories,
can
you
fill
them
for
us?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
secretary
have
authority
to
do
anything
other
than
those
draconian
things,
either
suspend
payment
or
dock
payments?
could
the
secretary
seek
the
kind
of
relief
these
plaintiffs
are
seeking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
about
the
secretary
herself?
suppose
that...
we
have
a
letter
talking
about
1992,
written
in
1994.
suppose
the
plaintiffs
say
the
real
problem
is
the
secretary.
she
is
just
letting
the
states
get
away
with
murder,
so
we
want
to
sue
the
secretary
for
insufficiently
monitoring
this
program,
not
simply
in
arizona.
there
may
be
states
that
are
much
worse
than
arizona.
how
about
that?
would
there
be
a
claim?
what
is
the
government's
position?
could
the
secretary
be
sued
for
abysmal
lack
of
enforcement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
that,
because
here
the
secretary
can
take
away
they
money.
there
the
question
was,
how
would
the
hospitals
respond?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
answer
is
that
there
would
be...
there
is
standing
against
the
state
department
of
welfare
but
there
would
be
no
standing
against
the
secretary?
