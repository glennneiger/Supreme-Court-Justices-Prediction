ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
clarifying
the
complaint.
the
complaint
in
paragraph
143
on
pages
36
and
37
of
the
joint
appendix
spells
out
the
particular
provisions
of
the
statute
and
regulations
that
are
being
complained
of
here.
they
include
the
collect
and
using
the
parent
locator
service
which
is
specifically
mandated
by
the
statute,
refusal
to
collect
in
the
manner
that
is
specifically
required
by
the
statute,
refusal
to
carry
out
paternity
determinations
in
the
manner
required
by
the
statute,
and
so
on.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
the
relief
that
was
requested
was
double.
on
page
42
there
was
first
relief
entering...
asking
that
declaratory
judgment
be
entered
determining
that
the
operation
of
arizona's
title
iv-d
program
violates
controlling
substantive
provisions
of
federal
law
creating
rights
in
plaintiffs,
and
those
provisions
are
the
mandatory,
specific,
and
individual
provisions
that
are
in
this
statute
and
the
implementing
regulations--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that's
correct.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
that's
right,
but--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
was
about
to
get
to
that.
i'm
sorry.
i
was
just--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
certainly
will,
and
what
i
was
going
to
say
about...
i
said
it
was
double,
and
i
was
getting
to
the
double
part.
the
double
part
was
a
request
for
an
injunction
of
that
kind.
however,
that
is
simply
the
prayer
for
relief.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
reach
any
remedial
question.
the
substance
of
the
complaint
is
with
respect
to
the
specific
enforceable
provisions,
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
case
was
found
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
and
remanded
the
question
of
relief
and
whether
that--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--injunction
is
proper
is
one
that
the
court
could
determine
at
that
point,
or
the
court
could
determine
now
that
isn't
proper,
but--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that
is
not
the
substance
or
the
core
of
this
case.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
the
best
authority
is
edelman
v.
jordan.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
edelman
v.
jordan.
that
case
is
almost
on
all
fours
with
this
one.
it
was
a
case
in
which--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
did
not
understand
that
edelman
v.
jordan
required
that
a
notice
went
out.
later,
in
koren
v.
jordan,
it
was
determined
that
notice
of
relief--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--edelman
was--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--at
that
time
was
assuming
that
the
statute
was
still
in
effect.
at
the
time
of
koren
that
statute
had
been
reversed,
but
at
the
time
of
edelman
the
statute
was
in
effect,
and
edelman
understood
that
what
the...
that
the
ongoing
injunction
was
going
to
remain
in
effect,
that
the
problem
was
with
retroactive
relief,
but
that
an
injunction
to
continue
to
comply
with
the
statute
was
quite
at
the
core
of
what
ex
parte
young
is
about,
and
the
case
is
really
indistinguishable
from
this
one.
it
is
like--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--at
this
juncture
the
issue
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
simply
whether
there
are
any
enforceable
rights
of
the
particular
kinds
that
are
alleged
here,
and
i
commend
again
section
143,
which
really
spells
out
what
they
are
under
1983.
the
relief
available
i
think
is
really
quite
a
separate
question.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
don't
think
he
would,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
bears
any
resemblance
to
that.
here
we
have
a
statute--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--this
court's
cases
make
that
quite
clear.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
first
of
all,
this
court
has
really
crossed
that
bridge
a
long
time
ago,
beginning
with
king
v.
smith,
rosado
v.
wyman,
edelman
v.
jordan,
thiboutot
itself,
wilder,
wright
and
so
on.
all
of
those
cases
have
exactly
the
structure
of
this
one.
they
are
cases
in
which
the...
there
is
a
spending
clause
statute
in
which
the
state
in
return,
and
i
should
say
here
for
a
large
amount
of
money
from
the
federal
government
in
a
situation
in
which
states
that
do
their
job
actually
come
out
with
a
net
surplus,
have
agreed
to
provide
specified
rights,
and
this
court
in
bennett
v.
kentucky
department
of
education--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
don't
know
whether
the
third
party
beneficiary
argument
was
made,
but
certainly
the
argument
that
the
only
enforcement
mechanism
available
is
that
within
the
statute
and
not
the
one
that
specifically
expressly
provided
by
1983
was
made,
but
i
would
also--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
would
say
that
there
was
probably
a
lot
less
than
there
is
here,
and
here
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
individuals
have
cognizable
rights
to
the
support,
and
what
the
statute
is
doing
is
assisting
them
providing
services
in
obtaining
the
support,
and
i'd
like
to
say
in
comment
to--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--actually,
it
isn't
true
that
that's
all
the
secretary
can
insist
upon.
the
structure
of
this
statute
includes
title
iv-a
and
title
iv-d.
title
iv-a
is
the
financial
assistance
provisions,
which
used
to
be
afdc
and
it's
presently
temporary
assistance
to
needy
families.
it
is
in
that
section
and
that
section
alone
that
the
substantial
compliance
language
appears,
and
it
appears
in
order
to
delineate
a
special
draconian
penalty
which
says
that
if
there
is
really,
really
noncompliance
with
the
statute,
not
only
is
the
money
that's
being
spent
for
iv-d
at
issue,
but
other
money,
separate
money,
money
that
is
not
being
spent
for
this
program
but
for
a
different
one
is
going
to
be
docked
as
well.
in
other
words,
it's
a...
really
it's
a
separate
and
draconian
penalty.
substantial
compliance
does
not
appear
in
iv-d.
iv-d
is...
all
of
the
requirements
set
out
in
iv-d
are
mandatory,
specific,
universal,
run
to
each
child,
every
child,
all
children--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--the
letter
that...
first
of
all,
i
believe,
and
perhaps
the
solicitor
general
can
clarify
this,
that
it
was
not
universal
in
any
event.
it
was
only
the
specific
issues
that
were
determined
not
to
be
in
substantial
compliance
earlier.
there
is
no
determination
at
all
that
at
this
moment
arizona
is
in
substantial
compliance
and,
indeed,
despite
the
representations
that
were
made
earlier,
arizona
is
dead
last
among
the
states
with
respect
to
the
efficiency
of
their
collections.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
but
in
any
event,
what
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
is
that
the
statute
as
read
against
bell
v.
new
jersey,
which
has
very
similar
provisions
with
regard
to
funding,
would
permit
the
secretary
to,
for
example,
recoup
misspent
money
and
the
regulations...
with
regard
to
iv-d
money
now,
on
a
full
compliance
level.
and
this
court
in
bennett
v.
kentucky
department
of
education
specifically
rejected
a
very
similar
argument
that
would
have
read
substantial
compliance
in
a
penalty
provision
into
the
liability
or
obligations
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
and
it
rejected
that
and
said
it
isn't
true.
it
only
applies
to
the
particular
penalties
as
to
which
the
substantial
compliance
language
appears,
and
it
does
not
delineate
the
obligation
when
the
obligation
itself
is
stated
in
a
mandatory
and
not
limited
fashion.
so
the
substantial
compliance
issue
here
is
largely
a
red
herring.
it
deals
with
a
very
specific
penalty.
it
does
not
deal
with
the
secretary's
rights
as
to
iv-d
money,
and
it
does
not
deal
with
the
beneficiary's
rights
as
to
iv-d
money.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
again,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
case
at
this
juncture
is
not
about
relief.
it's
about
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
1983.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
my
argument
was
simply
that
the
statute
in
terms
makes
it
only
available...
only
applicable
to
the
relief,
and
that
bennett
v.
kentucky
department
of
education
makes
clear
that
when
that's
the
case
it
applies
to
what
it
applies
to
and
not
to
other
provisions
that
do
not
in
terms
speak
in
other
than
mandatory,
specific,
and
universal
terms
which
the
various
provisions
here
do,
and
i'd
like
to
say--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--the...
again,
the
complaint
is
quite
specific
about
what
provisions
it's
complaining
about.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
it
mostly
cites
regulations,
but
those--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--primarily
the
provisions
of
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
are
the
ones
that
derive
from
654(4),
which
is
the
provision
that
says
that
each
child
is
to
be
provided
services
with
regard
to
location,
paternity,
establishment
of
child
support
orders,
modification,
and
collection,
and
then
there
are
various
provisions
in
this
statute
and
in
the
regulations
that
spin
out
exactly
what
that
means,
as
well
as
provisions
in
the
statute
which
spell
out
the
fact
that
the
regulations
are
binding
on
the
states,
and
that
the
secretary
is
to
issue
these
very
specific
timing
regulations,
which
he
did
do.
so
i
would
suggest
that
what
we
need
to
focus
on
here
is
the
substance
of
the
complaint,
and
that
the
relief
prayed
for
is
really
quite
beside
the
point
at
this
juncture.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
think
the
relief,
and
i...
we
say
this
in
our
brief,
given
the
very
specificity
of
the
statute
and
the
implementing
regulations,
it's
really
not
difficult.
the
relief
is,
comply
with
them.
that's
the
relief.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
as
to
the
particular...
i
mean,
obviously
the
person
has
to
have
standing
as
to
whatever
they're
complaining
about,
and
therefore,
for
example,
ms.
freestone's
problem
was
that
they
were
not
withholding
wages
from
her
husband
in
the
way
that
the
statute
requires,
and
the
relief--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--yes,
and
this
case
was
pled
as
a
class
action
and
has
been
certified--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--if
there
was
a
properly
certified
class
action
and
if
it
were
proven
that
there
was
an
overall
pattern
of
not
doing
so
after
a
trial,
then
ordinary
equitable
principles
would
apply.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
again
was--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that's
true,
but
the
state
has,
and
this
court
has--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--once
again,
this
court,
starting
with
rosado
v.
wyman,
has
dealt
with
this
problem
and
in
rosado
and
a
series
of
later
cases
has
suggested
the
nature
of
relief
which
might
be
available
here
would
be
conditioned
on
the
state
continuing
to
take
the
money.
if
the
state
at
any
point
decided
to
opt
out
the
money
the
requirements
would
no
longer
apply.
again,
this
has
been
thrashed
out,
it's
been
determined,
and
the
cases
are
there,
so
any--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
believe
rosado
was
a
class
action.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
again,
this
court's
cases
have
never
drawn
that
distinction.
many
of
the
cases--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--under
the
social
security
act
have
been
class
actions.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i
guess
because
it
would
be
difficult
to
find...
certainly
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
any
exception
in
1983
which
would
preclude--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
guess
because
the
individuals
in
question
who
are
class
representatives,
if
they
can
prove
a
classwide
relief,
are
simply
doing
what
a
class
action
proposes.
now,
again
i'd
like
to
reiterate--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--thank
you
very
much.
