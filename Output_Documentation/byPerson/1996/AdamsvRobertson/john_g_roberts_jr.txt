chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
jurisdictional
issue.
even
in
the
section
of
the
brief
that
the
petitioners
cited
that
was
under
the
heading
claiming
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
alabama
constitution,
alabama
law
requires
a
statement
of
issues
that
are
to
be
presented
to
the
supreme
court
and
limits
the
issues
to
those
that
are
stated.
the
federal
due
process
clause
issue
is
not
in
those
statement
of
issues.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
there
was
also
a
subheading
to
make
it
clear
what
the
constitutional
issue
was.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know
as
a
matter
of
practice.
if
it
went
on
to
address
it,
of
course,
then
it
would
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--could
be
presented
here,
but
it
quite
clearly
did
not
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
which
i
think
partly
explains
the
reason
it
was
in
the
respondent's
briefs
before
the
alabama
supreme
court,
because
it
was
decided
by
the
trial
court
in
alabama,
and
since
we
went
ahead
and
addressed
it
because
it
certainly
couid
have
been
addressed
by
the
alabama
supreme
court,
but
that
doesn't
cure
the
appellant's
failure
to
raise
it
properly
before
the
alabama
supreme
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
i'm
not
disputing
that
we
addressed
the
federal
due
process
issues
in
our
brief.
i'm
explaining
that
we
did
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
the
trial
court
did,
because
that
doesn't
cure...
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
certainly
free
to
say,
under
our
rules
we're
not
addressing
any
such
question
because
we
don't
see
it
presented.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
that
was
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
was
a
mistake,
certainly,
not
to
file
the
opposition--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
not
to
mention
it
in
the
one
that
was
filed.
we
think,
however,
that
that
doesn't
waive
the
objection
because
it's
jurisdictional
under
rule--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it...
it
did,
and
then
it
sort
of
stepped
back
away
from
it.
i
thought
it
was
decided
in
1836
in
justice
story's
opinion
in
crowell
v.
randell.
more
recent
opinions
have
said
that
it's
unsettled,
it
may
be
prudential,
and
the
court's
been
careful
not
to
decide
that
question,
usually
saying
the
prudential
reasons
are
sufficient
for
us
not
to
find
a
waiver,
and
we
think
that's
the
case
here
as
well.
the
most
obvious
one
is
the
federalism
concerns.
if
this
court
were
to
address
the
federal
due
process
issue
without
the
alabama
supreme
court
having
been
afforded
an
opportunity
to
do
so,
it
will
be
reversing
a
state
judgment
when,
for
example,
the
alabama
supreme
court
may
have
adopted
a
different
construction
of
the
rule
that
might
have
avoided
the
federal
issue,
or
it
may
have...
or
at
least
it
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
address
it
in
the
first
instance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
federalism
concerns
and
the
alabama
supreme
court's
opportunity
to
address
the
validity
of
its
rules
in
the
first
instance
under
the
federal
constitution
should
suffer
simply
because
of
a
mistake
by
counsel
in
not
filing
an
opposition
to
certiorari.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's...
well,
it's
also
a
concern
for
this
court
in
its
decisional
processes
just
to
make
sure
another
reason,
prudential,
for
having
a
requirement
that
the
issue
be
raised
is
that
a
full
record
be
developed
on
that.
we
don't
have
that
here.
there
are
a
lot
of
issues
in
which
there's
disagreement
about
the
record,
a
lot
of
things
we
don't
know
about
with
respect
to
some
of
these
particular
issues
because
it
wasn't
raised
below.
i
think
that's
a
concern
that
the
court
ought
to
weigh
at
least
as
heavily
as
incentives
to
encourage
the
filings
of
proper
briefs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
raised
at
the
trial
level,
but
we
don't
know
precisely...
and
again,
the
alabama
supreme
court
could
have
a
different
construction
of
its
rule,
and
the
claim
has
evolved
or
changed
as
it's
developed.
to
the
extent
it
now
focuses
on
nonresidents,
we
don't
know
who
the
nonresidents
are
from
the
record.
we
don't
know
what
their
contacts
with
the
state
of
alabama
are.
for
example,
we
don't
know
that...
whether
they
moved
after
getting
the
insurance
policy
or
not,
so
a
fuller
record
would
have
been
ensured,
i
think,
if
the
issue
had--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
i
agree
that
that
is
the
question
before
this
court.
however,
in
their
reply
brief
and
in
their
main
brief
as
well
they
seem
to
also
be
arguing
rights
of
nonresidents,
questions
i
don't
think
are
before
the
court,
again
issues
that
could
have
been
clarified
if
the
issue
had
been
raised
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
decided
by
that
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's
based
primarily
on...
well,
a
number
of
things.
first
of
all,
crowell
v.
randell
and
then
the
recodification
of
that
statute
after
that
opinion
is
on
the
books,
a
federalism
concern
that
this
court
should
not...
that
the
authority
that
this
court
has
to
review
a
state
court
judgment
rests
on
the
assumption
that
it
contains
within
it
a
decision
on
an
issue
of
federal
law
that
may
be
erroneous.
now,
if
it
does
not
because
the
highest
court
in
the
state
has
not
been
afforded
the
opportunity
to
address
that
question,
then
that
authority
is
not
present.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't.
that's
in
terms
of
how
you
analyze
what
may
be
an
ambiguous
state
decision,
but
here
we
don't
have
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
relied
only
on
the
alabama--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
if
there
were
some
confusion
about
what
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
michigan
v.
long
would
cut
the
other
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
state
courts,
of
course,
can
always
address
the
question
in
another
case,
the
next
case
that
comes
along.
i
don't
think
this
is
quite...
i
think
there's
more
flexibility
in
the
federal
system.
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
not
an
inferior
court
with
respect
to
this
court,
so
that
you
could
say,
take
a
look
at
this
a
little
more
closely
or
something,
as
you
may
with
respect
to
one
of
the
federal
circuit
courts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
precisely
with
the
practice
in
the
cases
you're
thinking
of
and
whether
they
apply
in
the
state
court
system
as
well
as
with
respect
to
federal
courts,
but
i
would
agree
that
if
there's
no...
if
it's
not
a
question
of,
there's
some
confusion,
you
don't
know
if
you
addressed
it
or
not,
then
yes,
if
it's
jurisdictional
there
would
not
be
authority--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i...
yes,
if
the
basis
for
action
is
that
the
court
is
uncertain
whether
it
had
jurisdiction,
but
if
it
is
clear
that
it
does
not
because
there...
it's
not
a
question
of
an
ambiguous--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
i
don't
think
the
court
precisely
distinguishes,
for
example,
when
it
denies
certiorari
whether
it's
doing
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
it
is...
and
it
was
expressly
recognized
as
an
open
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--whether
it
was
jurisdictional
or
prudential.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is
simply
that
one,
we
think
it's
jurisdictional
for
the...
at
least
for
the
reasons
given
by
justice
story,
and
if
not,
the
prudential
reasons
cut
strongly
against
deciding
a
federal
constitution,
particularly
concerning
the
validity
of
state
court
rules,
when
the
state
supreme
court
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
address
that
question.
turning
to
the
merits,
petitioners'
property
interest,
their
choses
in
action,
typically
may
be
resolved
in
an
individual
lawsuit
brought
at
a
time
and
place
of
the
plaintiff's
own
choosing,
but
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
prevents
a
state
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
from
providing
that
in
certain
circumstances
they
must
be
resolved
in
a
different
manner
through
another
remedial
mechanism.
and
when
the
state
does
that,
the
question
is
whether
the
procedural
protections
provided
in
that
different
mechanism
comport
with
due
process,
not
whether
the
petitioners,
the
prospective
plaintiffs,
have
some
overriding
right
to
avoid
the
chosen
procedure
and
opt
for
an
individual
lawsuit
instead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
procedure,
the
mandatory
class
action,
depends
upon
a
representative
plaintiff
coming
in
and
invoking
it.
in
mrs.
mcallister's
case,
that
was
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
class
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
in
fact
what
happened
with
those
suits.
they
were
dismissed
so
that
the
plaintiffs
in
those
suits
became
members
of
the
class.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there...
none
going
forward
now.
there
was
one,
the
peel
suit,
where
the
plaintiff
refused
to
have
the
suit
dismissed
and
the
counsel
disassociated
himself
from
carrying
that
forward.
the
class
action
mechanism,
once
it's
invoked
it
doesn't
go
back
and
say,
now,
last
year
one
of
these
claims
was
raised,
and
start
at
the
beginning,
but
it
says
from
now
on
we're
going
to
resolve...
the
claims
that
have
not
already
started,
haven't
already
left
the
gate,
we're
going
to
resolve
them
in
one
proceeding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
concern
in
each
of
those
cases
was
that...
the
particular
members
in
the
two
suits
that
you're
referring
to
were
former
officers
of
liberty
national.
there
was
a
concern
that
they
may
not
fit
the
definition
of
the
class,
and
the
individual
suits
were
filed.
when
it
became
clear
that
they
would
be
covered
by
the
class
as
certified,
the
cases
were
dismissed
and
they
recovered
as
members
of
the
class
and
no
more.
now,
once
alabama
says
that
from
now
on,
prior
cases...
the
issue
hadn't
come
up,
but
now
it's
come
up
we're
going
to
resolve
your
claims
in
the
procedural
device
of
a
mandatory
class
action,
the
question
is
are
the
procedural
protections
in
that
mandatory
class
action
sufficient
to
satisfy
due
process,
not
whether
there's
an
overriding
right
to
file
an
individual
lawsuit,
and
here
there
plainly
were
in
two
complementary
and
overlapping
respects.
individual
class
members
received
written
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
their
choses
in
action
were
resolved.
that
was
individual
written
notice.
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
was
in
court
before
a
judge,
with
counsel,
including
the
right
to
examine
witnesses,
present
expert
witnesses,
and
other
evidence.
it
was
a
right
that
the
petitioners
fully
availed
themselves
of
in
this
case.
they
had
their
own
day
in
court.
it
was
january
20,
21,
and
24,
1994.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
can
certainly
understand
that
reaction,
but
the
question
is
not
whether
any
individual
class
member
had
that
reaction,
but
what
was
appropriate
relief
for
the
class
as
a
whole.
the
district
court,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
policy
that
was
given
in
the
settlement
was
not
available
anywhere
else
in
the
market.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
to
deal
with
the
last
part
of
your
question
first,
they
did
not
have
perfectly
good
money
claims.
the
trial
court
found
that
these
claims
for
higher
premiums
were
largely
speculative
because
the
policies
that
they
received
by
and
large
with
rare
exceptions
provided
more
total
benefits.
they
looked
at
the
mcallister
case.
the
evidence
developed
in
this
case
demonstrated
that
for
the
vast
majority
of
insureds
the
new
policies
were
better.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
did
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
not
in
this
instance,
because--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
evidentiary
record
that
was
developed
in
the
subsequent
case
was
quite
different,
and
the
allegations
were
broader
in
the
second
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
the
evidence
of
record
on
which
mrs.
mcallister
relied
involved
specific
interactions
with
the
agent,
and
the
evidentiary
record
that
came
in
a
later
case
was
the
broader
question
of
the
policy
program
that
the
agents
were
operating
under,
and
it
was
a
different
evidentiary
record.
it
demonstrated...
the
trial
court
was
aware
of
the
mcallister
verdict.
it...
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
was
aware
of
its
affirmance
in
mcallister
when
it
decided
this
case,
and
the
evidence
demonstrated
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
the
higher
premiums
were
justified
because
there
were
more
benefits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
and
they
never
would.
there's
no
way
that
the
400,00
of
them
are
all
going
to
get
a
million
dollars
in
punitive
damages.
that's
the
justification,
one
of
the
justifications--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
question,
when
you're
trying
to
decide
whether
the
relief
under
the
class
that
the
class
is
given
is
equitable
and
monetary
is,
what
is
the
appropriate
relief
for
the
class
as
a
whole?
the
reason
these
people
took
out
cancer
insurance
policies
was
not
to
get
a
thousand
dollars,
it
was
to
get
coverage,
and
the
way
you
get
coverage
is
to
reform
the
policies
to
give
them
what
they
say
they
should
have,
the
benefits
under
the
old
policy,
and
to
compensate
further,
give
them
also
the
new
benefits
under
the
new
policies.
they
got,
as
it
was
said,
the
best
of
both
worlds,
something
they
couldn't
get
anywhere
else.
that's
the
most
appropriate
relief,
because
the
complaint
is,
you
took
away
our
coverage.
the
answer
is,
give
it
back.
not,
here's
a
thousand
dollars.
that
doesn't
give
them
the
coverage
they
wanted.
that's
why
i
think
it
was
appropriate--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
well,
with
respect,
the
circuit
court
decided
that
it
couldn't
be.
if
everybody
just
sued
for
damages
the
court
found
that
what
you
would
have
is
a
race
to
the
courthouse
among
400,000
people
with
essentially
similar
claims,
a
lucky
few
would
get
the
punitive
damages
windfalls,
the
vast
majority
would
be
left
with
nothing.
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that
doesn't
mean
it's
the
most--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
the
state
of
alabama
can
decide
that
we
think
it
would
be
better
to
bring
everybody
together
in
one
proceeding
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
the
question...
this
is
a
due
process
claim,
not
whether
the
settlement
was
fair,
although
we
think
it
was
fair,
but
the
question
is,
were
petitioners
afforded
due
process
before
their
claims
were
resolved
in
this
manner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
her
objection
that
she
had
received

john

--they
were
covered
by

release
in

don't

chief

john

--i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
they
were
peculiar
claims.
they
were
the
claims
of
the
class,
but
the
evidentiary
record
focused
on
her
particular
interaction
and
therefore
would
not,
i
think,
be
a
basis
for
preclusive
effects--
chief

john

--on
the

the
point
is
not--
chief

john

--absolutely.
i
wanted...
i
didn't

to
seem
to
agree
that
it's
a
question
of
the
greatest
good
for

it's
not.
it's
a
much
more
multifaceted
inquiry
into
the
fairness
of
the
settlement.
here,
what
the
settlement
did,
for
example--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

--no,
but
it
is...
their
attack
on

to
be
the
main

again,

may
have

against

if
they
declare

you
don't
get
an

lawsuit,
and
what
alabama
has
done
here,
along
with
39
other
states
and
the
federal
system,
is
say
one
situation
in
which
your
chose

normally
resolvable
in
an
individual
lawsuit,
may
be
resolved
in
some
other
manner
is
when
the
prerequisites
for
a
mandatory
class--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

--the
issue
is
whether
the
procedure
that
they've
been
provided
under
these
rules
comports
with
due
process.
there's
no
overriding
right
to
assert
under
the
federal
constitution
that
your
chose
in

must
be
resolved
in

court.
chief

john
g.
roberts,

i
don't
think
this
is
abridging
or
modifying
a
substantive
right.
it's
setting
forth
another
procedural
mechanism
to
resolve
the
chose
in
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

yes.
it
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
want
to
make
a
bitter-with-the-sweet
argument
because
that
doesn't
work
in
procedural
due
process,
so
i
don't
think
that
that
lesser--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
and
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
here,
as
far
as
procedural
due
process
goes
they
had
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
the
complementary
protections
of
the

rules.
chief

john
g.

certainly
it

not
violate

think
your
question
highlights
again
a
reason
that...
a
prudential
reason
the
court
shouldn't
reach
out
and
decide
the
issue,
because
we
don't
know
how
they
would

even
though
its

were
shared
by
400,000
other
people,
that
each

has
a
right

are

the

individual
notice

only
have
this
issue
come
up
after
we've
determined
that
they're
adequately
represented
in

action.
i
think
it's
the
former
system
that
is
subject
to
a
serious
due

challenge,
not
the
latter
one
that

adopted
and
that
the

supreme

affirmed
in
this
case.

you.
