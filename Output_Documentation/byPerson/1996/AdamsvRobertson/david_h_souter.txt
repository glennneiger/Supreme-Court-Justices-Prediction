justice
david
h.
souter
was
your
brief
that
specific?
when
you
recharacterized
what
was
in
it
a
moment
ago
i
thought
you
said
that
you
had
claimed
in
there
that
the
lack
of
opt-out
did
not
violate
any
constitutional
provision,
and
now
you
refer
specifically
to
due
process.
did
you
say
in
the
brief
that
it
does
not
violate
fourteenth
amendment
due
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
were
you
that
explicit?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
did
you
expressly
say,
the
lack
of
the
opt-out
does
not
violate
fourteenth
amendment
due
process?
i
mean,
was
that
statement
contained--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
page
23?
i
guess
your
position
was
that
it
would
violate
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
vice
versa.
did
you
state
that
explicitly
in
your
brief?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
that...
all
i
want
to
know
is
that
statement,
minimum
due
process
requires
an
opt-out,
was
in
your
brief?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
it
was
in
the
brief
consistently
on
pages
23
and
24,
referring
to
the
jurisdictional
right
of
a
plaintiff
who
is
absent
from
the
state.
is
that
the
argument
you're
making
here?
i
thought
you
were
making
quite
a
different
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
we
look
at
that,
as
we
do
after
the
fact
in
a
case
like
this,
should
we
bear
in
mind
which
of
the
fraud
damages
can
be
satisfied
out
of
these
special
funds
which
have
been
set
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless
of
how
they
might
otherwise
be
characterized,
and
i
want
to
hear
what
you
say,
but
is
it
at
least
a
subject
that
we
ought
to
look
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
how
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
just
yes
or
no.
do
we
look
to
whether
the
fraud
damages,
or
some
of
them,
can
be
satisfied
out
of
the
funds
that
have
been
set
up?
do
we
consider
that
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
particular,
punitive
damages.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
from
the
other
side
that
punitive
damages
are
not
substantively
anybody's
entitlement,
and
it's
really
up
to
the
state
to
decide
the
conditions
in
which
they
may
be
available,
and
if
the
state
class
action
rules
don't
make
them
available,
that's
certainly
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
decide?
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
question
of
state
law,
it's
not
a
question
of
federal
due
process,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
on
your
own
argument.
isn't
that
what
you
just
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
just
a
question
of
state
law
whether
it
be
constitutional
or
statutory?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
ask
in
that
connection,
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
conclusion
that
it's
the
greatest
good
for
greatest
number
analysis,
what
would
have
happened
if
edith
mcallister
had
not
sued
first
and
had
in
fact
objected
to
a
class
certification
covering
her?
what
would
the
result
have
been?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
she
have
gotten
out
of
the
class?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
despite
the
peculiarity
of
her
facts,
which
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
justified
the
special
or
the
separate
treatment,
if
her
timing
had
been
different
she
would
have
been
in
the
same
boat
with
everybody
else
and
those
special
facts,
in
fact,
would
not
have
justified
anything
but
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
she
didn't...
that's
the...
yes,
but--
--she
gave
away
something
that
other
people
didn't
have
to
give
away.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
ultimate
fraud
and
the
ultimate
damages,
those
were
common.
mcallister
in
those
respects
were
in
the...
was
in
the
same
boat?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
state
of
alabama
had
simply
removed...
had
eliminated
the
action
for
fraud
against
insurance
companies?
could
it
have
done
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
it
can
do
that,
a
fortiori
it
can
do
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
would
really
convert
this
into
something
other
than
a
procedural
due
process
case.
