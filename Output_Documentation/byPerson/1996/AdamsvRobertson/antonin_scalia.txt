justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
alabama
law,
and
one
reason
i
don't
is
because
the
alabama
court
never
addressed
any
of
this
stuff.
any...
i
mean,
you
know,
i'm
coming
back
to
the
jurisdictional
point.
even
if
it
is,
as
you
say,
prudential,
and
i
guess
that
depends
on
the
terms
of
the
1257(a)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
requires
that
the
issue...
final
judgments
or
decrees
rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
which
a
decision
could
be
had
may
be
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
by
writ
of
certiorari
where
the
validity
of
a
statute
of
any
state
is
drawn
in
question
on
the
ground
of
its
being
repugnant,
and
i
guess
that...
the
issue
is
whether
that
means
is
drawn
in
question
here
in
the
petition
for
cert,
or
was
drawn
in
question
in
the
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
it
means
in
the
state
court,
and
therefore
let's
assume
that
our
cases
that
have
dismissed
some
of
these
cases
are
all
based
on
discretionary
judgments.
why
isn't
a
valid
basis
for
answering
that
discretion
that
i
have
no
idea
what
the
state
courts
think
of
these
issues
that
you're
raising,
and
they
might
have
interpreted
their
state
statute
differently
had
they
seen
these
issues,
had
they
addressed
them,
and
had
they
seen
federal
constitutional
problems?
isn't
that
a
good
prudential
reason
for
us
not
to
jump
into
the
mess?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
prudential
reason
on
the
other
side,
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
roberts,
is
that
our
own
processes
make
it
important
that
counse
do
raise
these
problems
at
the
outset,
and
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition
frankly
induces
me
to
say
that
as
a
prudential
matter,
if
we're
going
to
be
serious
about
our
demands
that
these
issues
be
presented
in
the
bio
and
prevent
the
waste
of
our
time,
we
should
say
whatever
prudential
considerations
there
are
on
the
other
side
has
been
washed
out--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
the
failure
to
raise
it
in
a
timely
fashion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
arizona
can,
you
know,
after
our
opinion
on
the
merits,
should
we
find--
--alabama.
i'm
sorry,
alabama.
should--
[laughter]
arizona
has
enough
troubles.
should
we
find
that
it
is
not
jurisdictional
the
state
can
proceed
to
patch
up
its
law
to
meet
any
objections
that
our
opinion
might
have.
i
mean,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
was
raised
at
the
trial
level.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you
understood
justice
kennedy's
point.
i
think
he's
saying
that
our
gvr
practice
assumes
that
we
have
jurisdiction
when
we
remand
for
the
state
court
to
consider
a
federal
question
that
it
didn't
consider,
but
if
this
is
a
jurisdictional
statute,
the
fact
that
the
state
court
didn't
consider
it
means
that
we
don't
have
the
case
in
front
of
us.
we
have
no
power
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
state--
--we
can't
even
gvr.
--because
it's
not
in
front
of
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
else
is
new?
that
often
happens.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
most
often
happened
under
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
exactly
the
issue,
whether
it
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
doesn't
this
go
to
the
accuracy
of
the
definition
of
the
class?
if
there
are
people
like
mcallister
who
have
peculiar
claims,
can
you
chuck
them
in
with
everybody
else
and
say,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we're
treating
you
all
alike?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
say,
mr.
roberts,
that
the
state
could
abolish
that
cause
of
action
for
fraud
not
only
by
legislation
but
by
judicial
decision
if
it
chooses
to
operate
that
way,
and
that
that
wouldn't
violate
due
process.
