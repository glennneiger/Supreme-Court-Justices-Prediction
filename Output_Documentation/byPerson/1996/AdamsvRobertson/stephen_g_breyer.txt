justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
you
never
raised
that
point.
that
is
to
say,
as
i
read
every
single
sentence
on
pages
23
and
24
and
25,
which
i
have
in
front
of
me,
every
time
that
you
refer
to
it
you
talk
about
the
rights.
you
say,
in
shutts
the
trial
court
asserted
jurisdiction
over
nonresident
class
members
in
a
class
suit.
then
you
quote
it.
then
you
go
on
to
talk
about,
this
action
does
not
provide
absent
class
members
the
opportunity
to
remove
themselves.
the
u.s.
supreme
court
similarly
held
that
the
state
wishes
to
bind
an
absent
plaintiff,
et
cetera.
and
i
can't
find
anywhere
here
the
quite
different
argument
that
you
are
now
making,
which
i
take
it
is
an
interesting
question,
about
whether
people
who
are
within
a
state
have
a
right
to
be
opted
out.
if
you're
making
the
argument
about
absent
plaintiffs,
i
guess
it
was
decided
in
shutts,
and
you're
certainly
right
about
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't
say
that
in
the
brief,
and
moreover,
the
clause
you
didn't
quote
says
it's
our
view
that
it
has
to
provide
minimal
procedural
due
process
protection.
it
requires
absent
class
members
be
given
the
right
to
opt
out,
which
is
the
point
that
you're
making
in
this
section
of
the
brief,
so
where
in
the
brief
do
you
make
the
claim
which
you're
now
making
that
resident
class
members
have
to
be
given
the
right
to
opt
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
word
in
the
brief
anywhere
that
says
it's
across
the
board?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
that
referring...
i've
already
asked
this--
--to
the--
--i
don't
know
what
your
answer
is,
though.
it's
referring
to...
there
seem
to
be
two
claims
you're
making.
one
is,
alabama
court,
if
you
characterize
this
as
anything
other
than
a
money
claim
you're
going
to
run
afoul
of
the
united
states
constitution
in
respect
to
absent
plaintiffs.
cite,
shutts.
i
read
that
as
what
you
were
talking
about
on
pages
23
and
24.
then
i
found
another
claim
on
21
on
21
you
say,
look,
given
these
absent
plaintiffs
out
there
who
have
a
claim
under
shutts
for
due
process,
don't,
please,
characterize
this
as
if
it
were
nonmoney.
now,
maybe
that's
the
same
argument,
or
maybe
it's
two,
but
i
don't
see
anything
at
all,
not
a
word,
that
seeks
to
generalize
the
shutts
claim
to
the
problem
of
the
resident
non...
plaintiff,
which
is
a
totally
different
problem,
or
quite
a
different
problem.
now,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
i'm
not...
i'm...
you'd
say
maybe
i'm
wrong,
or
you'd
say
it
doesn't
matter.
it
has
to
be
one
of
those
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
you
one
question
on
the
merits,
which
i...
which
i...
how
we
get
to
this.
it
just...
is
this
your
view...
i'm
trying
to
understand
how
this
works,
but
suppose
that
we
have
a
defendant
who
is
being
asked
by
different
groups
of
plaintiffs
to
do
inconsistent
things,
the
classic
case
where
you
don't
get
an
opt-out,
and
each
of
those
plaintiffs
adds
a
clause
to
his
complaint
saying,
in
addition
i'd
like
punitive
damages.
what's
supposed
to
happen
then?
in
your
view,
is
the
addition
of
the
words
punitive
damages...
if
you
go
to
each
of
the
plaintiffs,
by
the
way,
and
say
is
it
important
to
you,
they
say,
sure
is.
it
might
be
a
lot
of
money.
so
is
the
simple
addition
of
the
word,
punitive
damages
to
a
class
action
that
plainly
is
not
an
opt-out
class
suddenly
converted,
making
it
an
opt-out
class,
or
making
it
a
no-opt-out
class?
