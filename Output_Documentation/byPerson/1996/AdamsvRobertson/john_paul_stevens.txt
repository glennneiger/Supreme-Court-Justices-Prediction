justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
talking
about
the
blue
brief
in
this
court
or
in
the
other
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking
you
what
document
you're
referring
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
do
you
think
michigan
v.
long
cuts
either
way
on
this
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
clearly
refer
to
the
alabama
constitution
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you'd
say
if
michigan
v.
long
is
implicated
it
was
complied
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
consistent
with
the
court's
practice
prior
to
michigan
v.
long.
it
frequently
gvr'd
when
it
was
uncertain
whether
it
had
jurisdiction--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
i
think
it
would
have
the
power
to
do
that
even
if
the
ultimate
decision
is
there's
no
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
there,
mr.
roberts,
at
least
in
newsom
v.
smyth
which
you
cite,
and
other
cases,
i
think
the
practice
of
the
court
has
been
to
dig,
to
d-i...
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted
rather
than
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction
when
this
problem
arises.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
it
could
do
it
on
jurisdictional
or
other
grounds,
but
at
least
they
have...
that
practice
has
left
open
the
possibility
that
we
might
have
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
