justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
members
of
this
class
were
from
out
of
alabama?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
400,000
in
the
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
claims
for
money
damages
of
this
type
have
gone
to
judgment
in
alabama?
is
there
any
case
other
than
the
mcallister
one,
where
there
was
a
thousand
dollars
compensatory,
a
million
punitive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
upset,
wasn't
it?
oh,
there
was...
it
was
actually
tried.
there
was
one
that
was,
pretrial,
thrown
out
and
then
sent
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
any
of
the
individual
cases
that
have
been
brought
so
far,
have
any
of
those
sought
anything
other
than
monetary
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
two
that
were...
there
were
two
brought
by
class
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
you
say
that
we
look
to
the
complaint
as
it
was
going
in
and
not...
that
the
settlement,
it's
the
claims
that
were
stated
and
given
up
and
not
the
terms
of
the
settlement.
is
that
what
your
position
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how...
i
think
that's
up
to
what
the
individual
wants.
one
individual
might
say,
i've
been
defrauded
by
this
insurance
company.
i
want
nothing
more
to
do
with
this
insurance
company.
i
want
money
in
my
pocket
and
i'll
find
another
insurer.
another
plaintiff
might
say,
well,
i'd
like
to
have
my
insurance
contract
reformed
so
it
will
get
rid
of
the
form...
fraud,
and
so
the
claim
for
fraud,
it
can
be
regarded
as
neuter
in
that
respect.
one
individual
might
say,
i've
got
a
good
common
law
claim
for
money
for
fraud,
and
another
one
could
say,
i
like
this
contract,
some
things
about
it,
so
i
just
want
it
to
be
reformed
to
get
rid
of
the
fraud.
so
how
can
you
say
that
just
the
fraud
inevitably
is
money?
it
could
be
whatever
the
individual
wants,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
is
it
vested
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
just
talking
about
the
punitive
side
of
it.
i
understand
the
compensatory
side,
that
every
member
of
the
class
relinquished
that,
but
the
punitive,
you
were
about
to
say,
i
think,
that
there's
something
else
going
on
in
alabama,
that
there's
some...
from
the
courts
coming...
that
not
all
400,000
people
are
going
to
get
a
million
dollars
punitive
damages.
you
were
telling
us
about
some
change
in
alabama--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waldrop,
it's
an
important
question.
would
it
not
be
better...
since
you
admit
that
you've
just
got
snippets
in
your
brief.
you
don't
have
it
in
the
questions
presented...
to
have
the
alabama
court
face
this
important
constitutional
question
squarely
so
that
we
could
then
be
a
court
of
review,
instead
of
saying
the
alabama
courts
didn't
touch
this.
maybe
you
raised
it,
but
hardly
in
the
clearest
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
brief
are
we
talking
about
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
it
true
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
all
one
thing
or
another?
you
want
to
have
a
class
for
punitive
damages,
but
then
you're...
doesn't
alabama,
in
addition
to
having
part
of
the
award
go
to
the
state,
have
some
sense
that
you
don't
punish
the
same
defendant
5,000
times?
is
there
none
of
that
in
alabama
case
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did...
you
did
bring
up
ticor
title
i
think,
didn't
you,
in
your...
in
a
long
footnote
in
your
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
at
least
as
the
question
was
presented
to
this
court,
and
i
think
as
mr.
waldrop
stated
it
in
court
this
morning,
they
are
not
raising
opt
out
just
for
nonresidents.
i
thought
the
statement
of
their
question
presented
in
their
cert
petition
was
that
opt
out
is
the
right
of
any
class
member
where
the
relief
relinquished
is
money
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
if
that's
what
alabama
had
done...
and
it
sounds
to
me
like
things
states
do
all
the
time.
they
take
away
tort
remedies
and
give
you
workers
compensation
instead.
but
that's
not
what
alabama
did.
alabama
said,
edith
mcallister,
you
get
a
thousand
dollars
in
your
pocket
and
a
million
in
compensatory,
and
there
are
30
other
suits
like
that.
indeed,
this
class
counsel
brought
two
such
suits.
so
that
seems
to
me
very
odd
that
alabama
should
say,
we
need
to
have
everybody
treated
alike
in
this
pot,
but
not
those
30
suits,
including
two
that
class
counsel
filed
for
straight
money.
that's
what
mixes
me
up
about
this.
how
can
alabama
say
it
must
be
a
unitary
thing,
and
yet
the
alabama
supreme
court
very
shortly
before
it
decided
this
case
affirmed
that
award?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
at
least
the
two
that
were
begun
the
day
before
this
complaint
was
filed,
shouldn't
they
have...
shouldn't
alabama
have
said,
okay,
now
we
have...
we
have
a
representative
action
going.
we
ought
to
dismiss
all
those
individual
actions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
are
no
individual
suits
going
forward
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
i
can
understand
saying
that,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
class
counsel
would
be
taking
inconsistent
positions
if
at
the
same
time
that
he's
putting
people,
even
people
who
don't
want
to
be
in
this
pot,
there
and
saying,
but
i
have
my
private
clients
and
i'm
taking
care
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
i
don't
think
anybody
is
questioning
that
there
was
notice
and
there
was
an
opportunity
to
come
in,
but
what
does
seem
strange
is
a
person
who
says,
i've
got
this
insurance
policy
that
i
acquired
because
the
company
was
fraudulent.
i
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that
company.
i
want
to
take
my
money
and
buy
another
policy.
and
then
in
this
class
suit
this
person
is
being
told,
you're
going
to
get
a
better
policy
from
the
same
company
and
you
must
stay
with
them.
there's
something
unseemly
about
that,
isn't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
have
a
new
rule
now
of
federal...
well,
this
is
state
procedure...
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number,
and
the
fact
that
some
people
who
would
have
had
perfectly
good
individual
money
claims,
that's
too
bad.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
roberts,
the
trial
court
did
not
have
the
alabama
supreme
court's
affirmance
in
the
mcallister
case,
and
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--now,
at
that
point,
liberty
national
has
been
found
fraudulent.
that
issue
was
raised,
litigated,
and
decided
in
the
mcallister
case.
wouldn't
that
be
preclusive
against
liberty
mutual?
let's
forget
about
this
class
action
going
on.
fraud
in
a
classic
action
at
law,
raised,
litigated,
and
decided,
the
insurance
company
loses.
isn't
policyholder
number
2
and
number
3
entitled
to
use
issue
preclusion
offensively
so
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
talking
about
your
case.
i'm
talking
about,
just
look
at
what
edith
mcallister
won,
a
thousand
dollars
compensatory,
a
million
punitive.
that
was
based
on
the
litigated
determination
of
fraud.
now,
couldn't
person
number
2
say,
i
like
that.
in
fact,
i
don't
even
need
the
punitives.
just
give
me
the
thousand
dollars.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
each
individual
in
this
$400,000
class
didn't
have
the
opportunity
that
edith
mcallister
had
to
show
what
their
situation
was,
what
the
agent
said
to
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
hypothetical
was,
they're
modest
people.
they
just
want
a
thousand
dollars.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
is
the
idea
of
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number.
now,
i
understand
when
there's
a
finite
sum
and
that's
all
that
there
is,
and
you
have
to
find
some
way
of
equitably
distributing
it.
i
also
understand
when
somebody
has
to
conduct
themselves
in
a
certain
way,
and
it's
got
to
be
one
way
and
it
can't
be
two
ways.
but
this
one
can
be...
it
could
be
everybody
just
sues
for
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
main
basis,
and
mr.
waldrop
confirmed
this,
was
that
they
can't
be
made
to
relinquish
a
claim
for
money
damages
without
an
opportunity
to
opt
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
may
be
different
in
alabama,
because
this
is
all
rules,
and
the
worker's
compensation
and
the
other
things
we've
been
talking
about,
bankruptcy,
these
are
highly
statutory.
alabama
does
copy
to
considerable
extent
federal
rule
23,
and
one
thing
we
know
about
the
federal
rules
is
that
the
federal
courts
are
not
authorized
to
write
statutes.
they
can
write
rules
of
procedure.
so
when
i
brought
up
the
worker's
compensation
model
i
had
that
in
mind,
that
that's
a
substantive
legislative
judgment,
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
serious
question
if
you
would
interpret
a
federal
rule
to
take
away
from
somebody
a
good
damage
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
your
answer
be
different
if
we
were
talking
just
about
the
rules
enabling
act?
let's
just
switch
for
a
moment,
because
alabama
does
seem
to
think
it's
instructive,
to
the
federal
rule,
and
the
federal
rule
says
that...
the
rules
enabling
act
says
that
such
rules,
rules
of
procedure,
shall
not
abridge
and...
or
modify
any
substantive
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
the
only
point
was
that
alabama,
since
it
seems
to
try
to
follow
federal
rule
23,
might
be
influenced
by
how
the
federal
development
went.
there
would
be
a
problem.
