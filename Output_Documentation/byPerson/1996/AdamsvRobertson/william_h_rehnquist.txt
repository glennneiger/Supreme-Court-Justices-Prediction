we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-1873,
guy
adams
v.
charlie
frank
robertson.
mr.
waldrop.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
certainly
didn't
in
shutts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
is,
assuming
that
we
were
to
decide
that
you
did
not
properly
raise
it,
and
the
question
then
is,
is
it
jurisdictional
so
we
must
dismiss
this
petition,
or
is
it
prudential,
and
he
says
is
it
a
good
prudential
reason
that
you
did
fail
to
raise
the
question
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
waldrop.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
statement
of
issue
at
the
beginning
of
the
brief,
mr.
roberts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fairness
of
the
settlement
really
hasn't
been
raised
by
these
petitioners,
has
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
requires
alabama
to
distribute
the
powers
of
government
the
same
way
that
the
federal
government
does.
the,
you
know,
judiciary,
legislative--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
waldrop,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waldrop.
the
case
is
submitted.
