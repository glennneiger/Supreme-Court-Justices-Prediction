justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
waldrop,
you
are
here
before
the
court
asking
this
court
to
decide
a
federal
due
process
issue,
and
whether
the
federal
constitution
requires
an
opt-out
provision
for
plaintiffs
in
the
class,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
can
you
show
us
today
or
point
to
a
place
in
the
record
in
this
case
where
that
issue
was
raised
by
you
before
the
alabama
supreme
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
blue
brief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
page
21.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
document
we
can
look
at
in
the
record
here
before
us,
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--are
you
referring
to
something--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
isn't
in
the
briefs
but
would
be
in
the
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
they
now
be
in
the
record
before
this
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
and
can
you
tell
us--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
what
were
the
questions
that
you
raised,
the
legal
issues
and
the
claims
in
the
alabama
supreme
court?
i
thought
there
were
three.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
raised
three
issues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
one
of
those
issues
was
that
because
there
was
no
opt-out
provision
for
the
class
it
violated
the
alabama
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
that
was
one
issue
that
you
raised.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
were
two
others,
but
neither
of
them
appeared
to
me
on
reading
them
to
raise
a
federal
due
process
violation
like
the
failure
to
have
an
opt-out
provision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
but
we
do
know,
i
guess,
or
will
you
concede
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
address
this
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you,
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
it
or
did
it
not?
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no
and
then
explain.
you
can
say
that
and
then
explain
what
you
would
like
to
explain.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
did
not
raise
it
in
any
of
your
claimed
issues
before
that
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
refer
us
now
to
pages
21
and
23
of
your
brief
to
the
alabama
supreme
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
just
suppose
that
we
don't
agree
with
you
that
it
dealt
with
non-state
residents
and
furthermore
that
we
conclude
that
the
question
you
want
this
court
to
address
on
the
due
process
clause
and
an
opt-out
requirement
for
residents
of
the
state
was
not
cleanly
presented
by
you
below,
and
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
address
it.
now,
let's
say
we
get
that
far
in
our
analysis.
is
that
failure
jurisdictional
or
is
it
simply
a
prudential
concern
we
might
have?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
brief
in
the
alabama
supreme
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
i
think
the
respond...
neither...
one
respondent
made
no
response
to
the
petition
of
certiorari.
an
individual
respondent
did
and
did
not
make
any
jurisdictional
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
what
do
we
do
about
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
indeed.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
address
that
question,
whether
it
is
jurisdictional
or
prudential?
this
court
has
not
quite
solved
that,
has
it,
as
yet?
