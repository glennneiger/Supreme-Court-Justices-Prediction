mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
were
206,255
class
members
like
petitioners
who
had
fraud
claims
for
substantial
money
damages
as
a
result
of
liberty
national
exchanging
their
cancer
policies
in
august
of
1986,
beginning
in
august
of
1986.
the
money
damage
claims
of
these
plaintiff
class
members
were
for
fraudulently
inflated
premiums
both
as
a
result
of
the
new
policy
being
more
expensive
and
the
shifting
of
policyholders
without
their
knowledge
into
higher,
more
expensive
age
bands.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
yes.
in
our
brief
on
page
21--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--the
blue
brief.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
twenty-one,
we
start
our
discussion--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
court...
i
thought
justice
o'connor
was
asking
about
the
court...
the
alabama--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--i'm--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
i'm
referring
to
the
briefs
to
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
yes.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
if
you
start
on
page
21,
and
then
on
page
23
of
our
brief
we
state
that
the
minimum
due
process
requires
that
class
members
be
given
the
right
to
opt
out,
to
exclude
themselves
from
the
class,
and
there
we
begin
talking
about
the
decision
of
shutts
v.
phillips
petroleum.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--yes,
we
did.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
we
did
argue
that
before
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
that
was
one
issue.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
we
felt
like
we
raised
it
with
sufficient
clarity,
because,
for
example,
the
respondents'
brief,
both
class
counsel
in
their
very
first...
the
class
counsel
raised
it
as
one
of
their
statement
of
issues,
and
then,
when
you
would
look
at
their
brief,
for
example,
in
their
summary
of
argument,
their
very
first
page
starts
out
by
saying
the
mandatory
class
and
class
action
settlement
on
a
no-opt-out
basis
was
proper
and
does
not
violate
constitutional
guarantees.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
they--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--no,
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
directly
address
the
no-out,
opt-out
issue
in
regard
to
due
process.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
they
did
cite
the
shutts
opinion,
but
they
cited
it
merely
for
the
fact
that
a
class
action
was
a
type
of
joinder.
we
felt
like
it
was
raised
with
compelling
clarity
because
class
counsel
responded
to
it
for
some
20
pages
in
their
brief.
the
liberty
national
responded
to
it
for
some
29
pages
in
their
brief.
so
we
felt
like
the
issue
was
in
fact
thoroughly
briefed
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
and
they
chose
not
to
address
it.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
we
felt
that
we
did
because
of
our
subheading
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
when
we
stated
that
minimum
due
process
required
the
right
to
opt
out.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
yes.
twenty-one--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
what
we
said--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
we
were
explicit
in
saying
it
violated
due
process
in
citing
the
shutts
v.
phillips
petroleum
case.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--exactly.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
we
stated
it
in
our
head
note,
justice
souter,
when
we
said
minimum
due
process
requires
an
opt-out,
and
then
we
were
discussing--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
we're
making
the
argument
here
that
shutts
requires
an
opt-out.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
two
things,
justice
breyer.
first,
the
very
last
sentence
we
made
on
page
25,
where
we
state
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
clearly
held
that
if
a
state
wishes
to
bind
an
absent
plaintiff,
and
our
term,
absent
plaintiff,
we
believe
in
shutts
means
residents
and
nonresidents.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
shutts
v.
phillips
petroleum
does,
in
fact,
say
that
absent
plaintiff
in
fact
refers
to
residents
and
nonresidents.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
our
view
is
that
on
page
23,
when
we
said
in
our
head
note
about
minimum
due
process,
we
were
referring
across
the
board.
we--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
only
the
head
note,
justice
breyer,
on
page
23.
we
have...
of
course,
in
our
petitioners
we
have
residents
and
nonresidents
in
our
group.
we
believe
that
shutts
v.
phillips
petroleum
in
fact
states
that
it
applies
to
residents
and
nonresidents.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
we,
of
course,
believe
it
would
be
a
prudential
concern,
because
we
believe
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
want
to
look
at
shutts
v.
phillips
petroleum
because
in
our
situation
we
had
objectors
who
were
nonresidents.
if
you
look
at
shutts,
and
if
you...
the
most
narrow
reading
in
shutts
would
have
declared
at
the
very
least
there
would
have
been
opt-out
rights
granted
to
nonresidents.
for
example,
if
i
could
refer
you
to
the
joint
appendix
in
volume
1,
on
page
238
and
239
you
would
see,
for
example,
at
the
trial
court
level
there
were
notice
of
opt-outs
filed,
for
example,
at
the...
in
the
barbour
county
circuit
court
and
citing
phillips
petroleum
v.
shutts.
there
were
also
pleadings
filed,
for
example
on
behalf
of
mississippi
residents
saying
that
the
fraud
had
occurred
in
mississippi,
and
they
were...
and
the
policies
were
delivered
in
mississippi.
so
we
believe
that
the
reason
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not,
in
fact,
want
to
look
at
shutts
even
in
the
most
narrow
sense
is
because
opt-out
rights
would
have
surely
had
to
be
granted
in
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
we
have...
the
objectors,
the
petitioners
are
543
people,
and
we
have
30
petitioners
who
are
nonresidents.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
that's
correct,
and...
well,
as
far
as
being
nonresidents,
that
particular
number
was
not
available
to
us,
although
we
know
that
these
policies
were
sold
in
seven
or
eight
states,
so
we
know
that
the
number
has
to
be
in
the
ten
of
thousands
of
nonresidents,
because
when
the
class
was
certified
in
barbour
county
it
was...
it
covered
all
the
states,
and
the
problem
was,
that
was
one
of
the
problems
in
the
barbour
county
circuit
court.
there
was
no
discovery
that
was
ever
conducted
in
any
of
the
other
states.
now,
in
regard
to
the
type
of
money
damages
that
the
absent
plaintiffs
have,
in
addition
to
the
fraudulently
inflated
premiums
there
were
money
damage
claims
in
this
case
for
the
denial
of
certain
medical
benefits,
for
chemotherapy,
radiation,
and
drugs
outside
the
hospital.
there
were
money
damage
claims
for
mental
anguish,
and
there
were
money
damage
claims
for
punitive
damages.
the
class--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--there
were...
there
have
been
two
cases
that
have
gone
to
judgment.
there
was
the
mcallisters
case
which
we
tried.
there...
which
was
a
thousand
dollar...
there
was
a
thousand
dollars
in
compensatory
damages
and
a
million
dollars
in
punitive
damages.
there
was
one
other
case
that
was
tried
that
was
a
verdict
for
the
defendant.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
there
were
two
cases
that
actually
went
to
a
jury
verdict.
the
mcallister
case
was
then
appealed
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
and
it
was
affirmed
on
appeal.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
there
were
32
cases
outside
the
class
when
the
class
was
certified
on
march
10,
1993.
to
my
knowledge,
all
of
those
cases
that
had
been
filed
sought
money
damages.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
class
counsel
filed
on
behalf
of
five
individual
clients,
and
in
each
one
of
those
there
was
a
claim
for
money
damages.
what
we
believe
is...
in
regard
to
shutts,
where
shutts
says
that...
and
when
it
establishes
that
an
absent
plaintiff
who
has
a
claim
for
money
damages
is
entitled
to
the
due
process
right
of
opt
out,
what
we
believe
is
this.
in
trying
to
determine
when
there
is
a
claim
for
predominantly
money
damages,
we
believe
that
the
test
should
be
three
things.
first
is,
we
believe
that
the
court
should
look
at
the
cause
of
action
that
is
constitutionally
protected.
in
this
case,
it's
a
fraud
cause
of
action.
what
is
the
traditional
remedy
for
a
fraud
cause
of
action?
the
alabama--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
justice
souter,
these
special
funds
were
declared
to
be
punitive.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
we
think
the
most
unreliable
thing
to
look
to
is
what
was
settled.
what
did--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
no,
justice
ginsburg.
what
i
was
saying
is,
first
we
think
you
should
look
at
what
is
the
traditional
remedy
for
the
cause
of
action
that's
being
asserted?
the
traditional
remedy...
not
looking
at
the
complaint.
what
is
the
traditional
remedy
for
a--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
no
in
this
sense,
that
the
remedy...
the
alabama
courts
have
held
in
regard
to
fraud
in
regard
to
an
insurance
policy,
they
have
held
numerous
times
that
you
can
affirm
the
contract
and
sue
for
money
damages,
or
rescind
the
contract
and
sue
for
money
damages.
that
is
what
has
been
traditionally
held
is
the
remedy.
the
second
thing
we
think
that
the
court
should
look
at
is,
what
is
the
absent
plaintiff
being
asked
to
give
up?
what
is
the
predominant
thing
the
absent
plaintiff...
in
this
case,
the
predominant
thing
is
money
damages.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
in
particular.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
alabama
law
appears
to
us
to
be
in
conflict.
henderson
v.
alabama
power
company,
that
struck
down
a
$250,000
legislative
cap
on
punitive
damages
because
it
violated
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
under
the
alabama
constitution,
so
they
in
fact
said
that
the
cause
of
action
was
constitutionally
protected.
however,
in
another
case--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
no,
sir,
justice
souter.
i
believe
that
once
you're
given
the
cause
of
action
and
it's
vested,
as
in
this
case,
then
you
are
entitled
to
due
process
in
the
manner--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--it
may
be
taken
away
from--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
all...
what
i
was
saying
is,
in
johnson
v.
life
of
georgia,
in
response
to
justice
souter,
was
in
that
case
they
said
that
once
you
got
the
award
they
could
take
half
of
it
away
and
give
it
to
the
state,
and
so
i
really
think
alabama
law
there
is
saying
that
constitutionally
you
have
the
cause
of
action,
and
it's
discretionary
with
the
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can...
whether
or
not
you
get
punitive
damages.
but
once
you
get
the
award,
it
can
be
taken
away.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
yes.
justice
scalia--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--no,
sir,
because
we
felt
that
this
issue
was,
in
fact...
we
had
been
raising
the
opt-out
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
we
believe
certainly
that
it
is...
it
is
not
jurisdictional.
we
believe
that
it
was,
in
fact--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
class
counsel's
brief
they
in
fact
stated
it
as
an
issue
presented,
and
so
we
believe--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
we're
talking
about
the
brief,
appellee
charlie
frank
robinson.
if
you
will
look
on
page
11
of
their
brief--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--yes.
if
you
will
look
at
the
brief
of
class
counsel
on
page
11,
issues
presented
for
review,
issue
4,
whether
an
opt-out
provision
is
required
by
the
due
process
and
our
trial-by-a-jury
guarantees
of
the
u.s.
and
alabama
constitution--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
justice
breyer,
all
i
can
say
is
that
we
felt
like,
starting
on
page
21,
that
we
had
raised
it,
and
we
felt
like
we
had
made
that
argument,
particularly
by
our
head
note.
it
is
absolutely
true
that
we
argued
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
very
strongly,
because
that
is
something
that
they
look
at.
we
felt
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
would
be
much
more
interested
in
that
issue,
but
we
did,
in
fact,
raise
the
no-opt-out,
and
we
felt
that
we
had
raised
that
issue.
we--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--well,
yes,
and
for
this
reason
in
alabama
it
would
be
an
unliquidated
claim,
and
it
would...
that
would
be
the
case
everywhere,
but
secondly
in
alabama
if
the
settlement
fund
in
the
class
was
sufficient
to
punish
the
defendant,
then
opting
out
would
serve
you
no
good
under
green
oil
v.
hornsby,
because
if
you
opted
out,
if
there
was
already
a
sufficient
fund,
the
green
oil
curtain
would
come
down
in
alabama.
so
we
believe
that
under
alabama
law
that
punitive
damages
in
a
class
action,
you
should
have
the
opt-out
right.
i
mean,
i'm
aware
from
other
jurisdictions--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--there
is
in
green
oil,
v.
hornsby.
one
of
the
things
that
you
look
at
is
successive
punitive
damage
awards.
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
in
the
settlement
99.9
percent
of
the
absent
plaintiffs
don't
share
in
the
funds
for
punitive
damages.
the
respondents
make
the
argument
about
punitive
damages,
but
in
this
case
99
percent
of
them
are
not
going
to
share
at
all
in
anything
to
do
with
punitive
damages.
they
traded
their
punitive
damages
claims
for
nothing.
so
in
this
case
opting
out
in
regard
to
punitive
damages
would
clearly
be
the
thing
to
do,
because
they
were
traded
for
nothing,
and
so
that
is
the
reason
in
this
particular
case
that,
as
we
say,
they
all
had
money
damages,
compensatory,
they
had
money
damages,
punitive
damages.
if
i
might
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
well,
we
believe
that
a
cause
of
action,
a
fraud
cause
of
action,
this
court
had
already
said
in
mullane
v.
central
hanover
bank
back
in
1950
that
a
cause
of
action
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
in...
so
in
this
case,
once...
and
under
alabama
law
once
you
have...
a
cause
of
action
for
fraud
is
vested,
it
cannot
be
taken
away.
secondly,
this
settlement
perpetuated
the
fraud,
because
the
various
class
members
had
to
continue
to
pay
premiums
if
they
were
to
get
any
benefit
out
of
the
settlement
at
all.
lastly,
in
regard
to
shutts,
we
believe
that
if
shutts
in
fact
was
only
a
territorial
jurisdictional
case,
which
we
believe
that
it
was
not,
we
believe
that
fundamentally
it
should
apply
across
the
board
for
two
reasons.
one,
there's
no
fundamental
difference
between
a
nonresident
and
a
resident.
if
you're
going
to
put
them
together
for
money
damages
on
the
front
end
for
certification...
that
is,
they
have
the
same
unity,
cohesiveness,
typicality,
and
commonality
on
the
front
end...
then
on
the
back
end
you
can't
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
they
should
have
a
right
to
opt
out
or
not,
because
that
would
be
arbitrary
if
you're
going
to
put
them
together
on
the
front
end
in
regard
to
money
damages.
secondly,
in
regard
to
rule
(c)(2)
of
the
federal
rules
as
well
as
the
alabama
rules,
in
regard
to
(b)(3)
actions,
which
are
normal
money
damages,
it
is
a
mandatory
notice
that
the...
that
you
have
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
the
right
to
opt
out.
the
advisory
comments
to
the
federal
rule
says
that
that
has
constitutional
underpinnings.
in
its
cites...
mullane,
and
it
cites
hansberry
v.
lee.
in
fact,
this
court
in
1974,
in
the
eisen
case,
cited
those
advisory
comments
with
approval,
so
we
think
that
if
shutts
was
only
a
territorial
jurisdictional
case,
which
we
don't
believe
that
it
was,
because
when
the
court
in
footnote
number
3
in
shutts
said
that
we're
going
to
limit
our
holding--
mr.
norman
e.
waldrop,
jr.
--thank
you.
