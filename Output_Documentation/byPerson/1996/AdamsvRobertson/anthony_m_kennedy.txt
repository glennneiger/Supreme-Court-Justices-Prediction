do
you
know,
mr.
roberts,
what
happens
if
the
alabama
supreme
court
sees
a
federal
constitutional
issue
when
the
briefs
have
been
presented
to
them
in
the
fashion
you
describe,
and
the
federal
constitutional
issue
is
not...
what
does
the
alabama
supreme
court
do
then,
do
you
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
under
their
rules
they're
free
to
go
ahead
and
address
it
if
they
see
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
argument
that
it
would
be
jurisdictional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
sometimes
grant,
vacate,
and
remand
in
light
of
new
congressional
statutes,
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i'm
not
sure,
if
we
say
that
this
is
jurisdictional,
that
that
wouldn't
confine
our
authority
in
those
cases,
if
we
say
it's
jurisdictional
if
the
state
hasn't
even
raised
it
because
there's
good
reason
for
it
not
to
have
done
so.
