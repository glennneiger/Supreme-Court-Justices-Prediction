justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
staying
out,
as
you
put
it,
one
of
the
options?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
fact,
as
i
understand
it,
some
of
these
individuals
who
were
denied
parole
were
brought
back
like
this
particular
prisoner,
and
some
were
not,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
all
of
them
have
been
brought
back.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
the
case
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
your--
--what
is
the
change
in
the
law
between
the
time
he
was
brought
back
and
the
present
that
explains
why
some
of
the
prisoners
are
not
being
brought
back
today,
whereas
he
was?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
has
there
been
any
change
in
the
state
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
doesn't
cover
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
explain
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
anything,
the
difference
in
treatment?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a
matter
of
administrative
practice?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
before
you
go
on
to
that,
how
is
the
decision
being
made
today
as
to
whether
he...
a
given
prisoner
will
be
brought
back
or
not?
i
mean,
i
assume
they're
not
flipping
coins.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
are
they
making
this
decision?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
is
it
grounding
its
decision
on?
what
does
it
consider?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
it's
not
flipping
a
coin,
wouldn't
a
hearing
with
an
opportunity
to
appear
and
give
reasons
why
one
should
be
brought
back
or
not
brought
back
function
as
a
normal
due
process
hearing
would
function?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
leaving
the
liberty
interest
issue
aside,
there
would
be
the
same
function
for
this
hearing
that
there
would
be,
i
presume,
for
a
parole
revocation
hearing.
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
argue
that
one
should
not
be
brought
back,
for
whatever
equitable
reasons
one
could
raise.
that's
fair
to
say,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
this
is
a
question
which
involves
not
only
a
reclassification,
but
a
revocation
of
liberty,
and
morrissey
and
brewer
says
expressly,
whatever
you
call
it,
by
whatever
name,
the
liberty
in
fact
is
an
interest
which
deserves
a
hearing
before
it
is
revoked,
so
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
fall
within
the
terms
of
morrissey,
because
you
have
a)
liberty
in
fact,
and
b)
a
discretionary
decision
about
whether
to
revoke
it
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
fall
within
the
language
that
i
just
referred
to.
you
would
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
that
as
a
result
of
this
pre-release,
pre-parole
scheme
that
the
discretion
the
governor
previously
had,
which
i
assume
was
unreviewable,
is
now
in
some
sense
subject
to
a
due
process
requirement
simply
because
he
was
on
release
before
the
governor
made
his
discretionary
decision?
is
that
your
argument?
