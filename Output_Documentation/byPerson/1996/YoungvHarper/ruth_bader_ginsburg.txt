justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
harper
was
asked
at
the
time
he
was
put
in
this
program,
he
was
asked
to
sign
a
form,
and
i'm
lcoking
at
page
5
of
the
joint
appendix.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
form
says,
reviewed
options
available
in
the
event
of
parole
denial,
and
he
signs
it,
and
i
guess
somebody
from
the
department
of
corrections
signs
it.
well,
what
were
those
options
that
were
reviewed
with
him
that
would
be
available
in
the
event
of
parole
denial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
was
a
misrepresentation
on
the
form
that
they
asked
him
to
sign?
it
said
options?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
supervisor
while
he's
at
liberty
would
be
the
same
whether
he's
on
parole
or
pre-parole?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
under
the
program
currently
someone
is
kept
in
the
program
even
if
they're
denied
parole
until
there's
a
90-day
period
when
they
decide
what
will
be
done
with
the
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
terms
of
what
is
told
to
a
person
who
is
entering
such
a
program,
we've
already
established
that
we
don't
know
what
options
there
were,
but
he
was
also
asked,
harper
was
asked
to
sign
another
thing,
and
this
is
on
page
9
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
signed
saying,
i
understand
that
waiving
parole,
waiving
parole
while
on
pre-parole
status
will
result
in
reclassification
to
a
higher
security
status.
what
does
that
mean,
waiving
parole?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
would...
why
a...
would
someone
decide
that
they
don't
want
to
be
considered
for
parole?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
says
that
if
he
does
that...
if
he
waives
parole,
this
says,
while
he's
on
pre-parole
status,
back
he
goes.
it
will
result
in
reclassification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
is
telling
him,
you
must
be
considered
for
parole
when
your
time
comes
up,
otherwise
you
go
right
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
document
when
the
new
rules
came
in.
well,
let's
see
if
we
can
get
agreement
on
a
basic
proposition.
that
is,
suppose
oklahoma
law
was,
you're
denied
parole.
the
denial
of
parole
by
the
governor
means
you
go
back,
no
ifs,
ands,
or
buts,
there
wouldn't
be
any
due
process,
right,
would
there,
if
that
were
the
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
question
is,
is
that
what
we
have
in
this
case?
you
would
agree
that
there's
no
need
for
a
hearing
if
it
follows
like
the
night
the
day
the
governor
denies
parole,
you're
required
to
go
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
reason
is,
the
governor
denies
parole.
the
governor
has
the
discretion
to
grant
or
deny
parole.
the
governor
denies
parole.
the
rules
are,
denial
of
parole,
you
go
back
to
prison.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
question
is,
is
that
what
this
statute
says,
because
a
90-day
period
didn't
come
in
until
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
say
it
is.
they
said
it
could
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
because
there's
nothing
to
which
due
process
right
could
attach,
a
due
proces
procedural
right.
do
we
know
whether
anyone
else
was
exposed
to
this
telephone
call,
or
whatever
it
was,
shall
return
to
the
prison
within
5
hours?
was
that...
how
long
did
the
situation
persist
before
the
90-day
procedure
came
into
play?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
hearing
to
do
what,
because
i
think
as...
first,
there's
no
dispute
on
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
any
disciplinary
reason,
right?
you
concede--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
only
reason
given--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
that
the
governor
denied
parole,
so
there'd
be
no
hearing
to
decide
what
was
the
reason.
everybody
agrees
that
he
didn't
commit
any
disciplinary
offense.
he
was
a
model--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--pre-parolee,
and
he
was
called
back
for
one
reason
only,
that
parole
was
denied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
the
examples--
--i
think
the
argument
you're
making
is
that
this
excerpt
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
only
establishes
that
denial
of
parole
is
a
permissible
reason--
