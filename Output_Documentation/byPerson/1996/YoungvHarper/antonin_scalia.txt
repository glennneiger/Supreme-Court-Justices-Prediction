justice
antonin
scalia
well--
--you
mean
there
were
no
options,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
options
would
there
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
howard,
who
administers
the
pre-parole
program.
is
it
administered
by
the
prison
warden?
justice
antonin
scalia
or...
and
who
administers
parole?
is
it
a
separate
organization?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
once
they
go
out
on
parole,
i
mean,
who
takes
care
of
seeing
that
everybody's
abiding
by
his
parole
restrictions
and
so
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
the
pardon
and
parole
board,
which
is
independent
of
the
bureau
of
corrections?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
judgment
whether
to
bring
him
back,
for
example,
or
whether
to
impose
some
kind
of
a
sanction,
whether
it's
more
frequent
consultation
with
a
parole
officer
or
denial
of
good
time
credits
or
whatever
else,
that
judgment
is
made
by
the
warden
or
by
the
department
of
corrections?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
by
the
parole
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
couldn't
leave
the
state.
isn't
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
can
he
leave
the
state,
the
parolee?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
is
confined
to
the
county,
and
the
parolee
is
confined
to
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
you
want
to
answer
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
parolee
is
confined
to
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
he
gets
permission.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
pre-parolee
is
confined
to
the
county.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
pretty
big
difference,
i
suppose.
how
many
people
in
your
estimation...
no,
how
long
in
your
estimation
do
people
spend
on
pre-parole
release?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
everybody
else
is
a
quadruple
ax
muroerer,
they
would
presumably
let
out
the
triple
ax
murderer,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i...
it
doesn't
mean
that.
it
just
means
if
you
don't
live
up
to
the
expectations
you
will
be
pulled
back.
it
doesn't
mean
you
can't
be
for
other
reasons,
necessarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
sort
of
compelled
to
argue,
aren't
you...
don't
you
really
have
to
answer
yes
to
the
question
justice
kennedy
was
asking?
if...
if
this
could
be
revoked
for
any
reason
whatever,
what
good
would
a
hearing
be?
i
mean,
you
usually
don't
have
a...
you
usually
have
a
hearing
to
find
out
whether
a
particular
legal
requirement
was
complied
with
or
not.
if
there's
no
legal
requirement,
what
possible
good
is
the
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
your
client
comes
in
and
says,
you
know,
you
pulled
me
back,
and...
yes,
we
did.
why?
he
says,
oh,
because
we
felt
like
it.
a
hearing
would
be
utterly
useless,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
an
essential
part
of
your
case,
though.
you...
in
order
to
get
to
the
due
process
procedural
point
you
have
to
establish
that
there
was
not
an
automatic
revocation
of
pre-parole
status
if
parole
was
denied,
that
that
was
not
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
that
argument
the
same
as
the
argument
that
he
had
to
go
back?
once
parole
was
denied,
he
had
to
go
off
of
pre-parole?
now,
you
say
it's
so
inherently
incredible.
i
mean,
maybe.
why
is
it
incredible
that
that
would
be
the
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
revoking
pre-parole,
not
that
it
is
an
automatic
and
mandatory
reason.
that
isn't
established.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
point
is
that
if
it
is
only
a
permissible
reason,
he
should
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
that
in
this
case
it
shouldn't
be
permitted.
