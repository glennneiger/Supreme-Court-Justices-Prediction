justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
you
said
this
is
different
from
parole,
and
you
never
quite
explained
why.
would
you
tell
me,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
person
out
of
jail,
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
think
that
morrissey,
if
he
was
disrespectful
to
his
parole
officer,
could
have
been
disciplined?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
in
other
words,
there's
discipline
short
of
revocation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
are
good
time
credits
shortening
the
release
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can't
a
person
on
parole
earn
those,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
pretty...
maybe
it's
the
same
question
the
chief
justice
asked
in
another
way.
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
for
it,
and
a
lot
of...
if
he
does
something
wrong,
different
things
can
happen
to
him
from
the
parolee.
but
supposing
he
just
works
and
earns
his
money
and
pays
his
rent
and
does
everything
else,
and
reports
to
whoever
it
is
he
has
to
report
to,
is...
does
he,
in
his
normal
daily
life,
if
he
behaves
himself
completely,
is
there
any
difference
in
his
life
and
that
of
a
parolee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
going
to
work,
and
going
to
the
movies,
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
about...
what
if
the
parolee...
couldn't
parolee
go
back
in
for
medical
treatment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could
not...
oh,
not
unless
his
parole
is
revoked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he's
better
off
than
the
parolee.
a
parolee
cannot
leave--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
on
the
medical
point
you
made,
i
think
you're
saying
that
the
person
on
pre-parole
is
better
off
than
the
parolee,
right,
because
he
has
an
option
the
parolee
doesn't
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
wouldn't...
if
he
could
pay
for
the
doctor
himself,
he
could
go
to
his
own
doctor,
just
like
the
parolee
could.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
along
justice
o'connor's
line?
supposing
the
prison
is
extremely
crowded.
is
it
permissible
for
the
parole
board
to
take
that
fact
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
to
grant
someone
parole
that
might
not...
could
be
right
on
the
margin?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
overcrowding
could
play
a
role
in
either
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
specifically
is
a
response
to
overcrowding.
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
there
were...
i
think
your
opponent
said
there
were
something
like
1,200
people
in
the
program,
and
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
or
not
when
other
people
had
their
parole
denied
they
were
automatically
taken
off
the
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
then
the
question
is,
who
has
the
burden
of
establishing
what
the
rule
of
law
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
indeed,
if
that
were
the
law,
they
couldn't
have
adopted
the
90-day
procedure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
there
was
a
statutory
change
during
that
5-month
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do,
will
you
tell
me
what
the
statutory
change
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
either
the
statute
before
or
after
that
amendment
make
any
reference
to
the
governor's
denial
of
parole
as
a
reason
for
terminating
pre-parole?
