chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1598,
leroy
young
v.
ernest
eugene
harper.
ms.
howard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
flipping
a--
--but
what
was
it
in
the
regulations
or
the
statute
at
the
time
that
this
took
place
that
said
that
pre-parole
can
be
revoked
upon
the
governor's
refusing
a
pardon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes.
i
suppose
also
morrissey
v.
brewer
may
have
decided
this...
described
kind
of
a
generic
parole.
it
didn't
purport
to
account
for
all
the
different
variations
in
the
different
states,
and
i
gather
what
your
state
is
saying
is
that
the
oklahoma
system,
at
least
now
and
perhaps
as
it
was
when
this
respondent
was
dealt
with
by
it,
was
different
from
the
ordinary
system.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can't
under
our
due
proces
cases
say
that
we
have
a
particular
scheme
here,
and
it
doesn't
call
for
a
hearing,
and
therefore
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
mean,
if
the
scheme
calls
for
a
determination
of
facts
before
a
particular
action
can
be
taken,
then
due
process
may
be
implicated
even
though
there's
no
provision
for
a
hearing
in
the
state
system.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
have
the
joint
appendix
before
me,
ms.
howard,
but
what
exactly...
you
say
the
inmate
was
aware
he
can
be
reclassified
to
be
in
fact
brought
back
for
several...
including
the
governor
has
denied
the
inmate
parole.
now,
what
exactly
does
that
section
you're
referring
to
say
about
being
brought
back
if
the
government...
if
the
governor
denies
parole?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
general
language
you
can
point
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
now,
that's
drawing
a
legal
conclusion,
but
i'm
curious
to
know
just
what's
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
prison
officials
in
effect
regarded
this
as
just
another
form
of
confinement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
it
wasn't
in
the
prison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
restrictions
were
placed
on
him
that
were
different
from
restrictions
placed
on
parolees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
in
that
sense
all
of
the
people
still
in
prison
are
better
off
than
the
parolee.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
you
don't
have.
[laughter]
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--ms.
howard.
ms.
winter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
morrissey
opinion
was
entitled...
was
intended
to
apply
to
every
single
program
that
a
state
might
set
up
under
the
name
of
parole,
no
matter
what
the
conditions
of
it
were?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
really
have
to
examine
the
oklahoma
program,
don't
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
see
what
would
be
morrissey's
impact
on
it
in
terms
of
a
duty
process
hearing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--court
of
criminal
appeals
that
justice
breyer
is
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
not
just
they
say,
it's
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma
that
says.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
say
it
becomes
a
triggering
event.
that
suggests
that
there
are
other
issues
to
be
inquired
into.
but
what
if
the
rule
in
oklahoma
is
simply,
when
the
governor
denies
parole,
you're
recalled,
period?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how...
but
there
isn't
any
intimation
in
the
opinion
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
more
factors
somehow
are
involved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
federal
court.
i
would
think
he
would
have
the
burden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
change
the
burden
because
he
was
pro
se?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
wait
a
minute.
we're
kind
of
sliding
around
several
things
here.
it's...
i
take
it
it's
up
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma
to
decide
whether
or
not
someone
is
pro
se
would
change
the
burden
of
proof
there.
are
you
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
a
federal
court
must
shift
the
burden
of
proof
because
a
plaintiff
is
pro
se?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he's
got
a
right
to
a
full
and
fair
hearing
on
disputed
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
now
the
tenth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
the
record
simply
didn't
show
on
that
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
you
really
don't
have
the
factual
basis
to
say
the
governor...
that...
or
the
board
retained
discretion,
if
the
record
simply
doesn't
show
what
happened
to
other
people
whose
parole
was
denied
by
the
governor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
winter.
the
case
is
submitted.
