ms.
sandra
d.
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
during
the
past
decade,
oklahoma,
like
many
other
states,
has
experienced
a
serious
prison
overcrowding
problem.
in
an
attempt
to
deal
with
this
crisis,
and
at
the
same
time
to
meet
the
goals
of
incarceration,
the
oklahoma
legislature
has
had
to
come
up
with
some
innovative
programs.
one
such
program
is
the
program
at
issue
here
today,
the
pre-parole
conditional
supervision
program.
ernest
harper
was
placed
on
this
program
after
serving
14
years
of
a
life
sentence
for
first
degree
murder.
he
was
reclassified
to
a
higher
security
level
when
the
governor
of
oklahoma
denied
his
parole.
the
tenth
circuit
found
that
because
mr.
harper
had
been
serving
his
sentence
outside
the
physical
boundaries
of
a
prison,
that
his
program
was
like
parole,
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
full
protections
of
a
morrissey
v.
brewer
hearing
before
reclassification.
we
believe
the
tenth
circuit
erred
in
one
major
reason.
the
tenth
circuit
failed
to
consider
the
true
nature
of
the
program.
the
tenth
circuit's
approach
to
the
program
was
really
very
simple.
the
tenth
circuit
found
that
because
this
was
a
program
in
which
a
prisoner
was
serving
his
sentence
outside
the
four
walls
of
the
prison,
that
it
was
like
parole.
it
is
really
very
different
from
parole
in
several
respects.
first,
i
think
what
we
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
nature
of
the
program.
you
told
us
that
in
sandin,
and
you
had
told
us
that
previously
in
meachum
v.
fano
and
other
cases,
and
when
we
look
at
the
nature
of
the
program,
we
have
to
consider
several
things.
first,
we
have
to
consider
the
purpose
for
which
the
program
was
instituted.
we
have
to
consider
the
function
of
the
program,
how
it
operates
within
the
state,
and
this
program,
unlike
parole,
does
not
function
as
a
program
to
reintegrate
people
into
society.
it
functions
as
a
program
to
alleviate
prison
overcrowding.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
there--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--there
were
some
written
procedures
at
that
time.
they
did
not
deal
specifically
for
reclassifying
somebody
in
the
particular
situation
that
mr.
harper
was
in.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
nothing
specific.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
several
procedures
have
been
adopted
by
our
pardon
and
parole
board
since
that
time,
and
in
1991,
after
the
time
mr.
harper
was
already
brought
back
onto
the
program,
our
pardon
and
parole
board
adopted
a
policy
where
they
now
leave
people
out
for
90
days
before
reexamining
them
and
determining
whether
to
bring--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--actually,
it's
a
determination
made
by
our
department
of
corrections,
which
is
somewhat
confusing
in
this
case.
the
pardon
and
parole
board
recommends
people
for
pre-parole
to
our
department
of
corrections,
and
the
department
of
corrections
makes
the
ultimate
decision
about--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--yes,
it's--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--it
is
totally
discretionary
with
the
department,
and
they
derive
their
authority
from
this
court's
opinion
in
meachum
v.
fano.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
yes,
they
can.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i
would
advise
that
that
would
be
permissible
in
this
situation.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
no.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i'm
not--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--right.
i'm
not--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--well,
i'm
not
discounting
any
type
of
claim,
a
first
amendment
violation
or
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
if
there
were
an
independent
constitutional
violation.
we're
not
saying
that
they
can
revoke
on
the
basis
of
exercising
their
first
amendment
or,
you
know,
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
other
than
that,
other
than
some
independent
constitutional
violation--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--again,
there's
nothing
specific
in
the
statute.
what
we
do
have,
we
have
a
statute
which
implements
the
program,
and
it
indicates
that
people
on
that
program
are
inmates
within
the
department
of
corrections.
it
indicates
that
they
are
subject
to
escape
charges
if
they
don't
report
back
from
the
program.
it
indicates
also
that
they're
subject
to
the
disciplinary
proceedings
of
the
department
of
corrections.
from
that
we
assume,
or
we
know,
that
this
is
a
type
of
classification
within
the
department
of
corrections
under
meachum
v.
fano.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
yes.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
at
the
end,
we
don't
have
anything
specific
in
our
regulations
saying
what
those
options
were.
i'm
told
by
the
department
of
corrections
that
at
that
time
it
was
automatic,
that
if
the
governor
denied
parole
they
automatically
reclassified--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--well,
we
don't
know
for
sure
if
those
options
are
only
limited
to...
to
two
options
of
either
being
brought
back
in
or
being
stayed
out.
it
could
be
other
options
that
are
not
directly
related
to
the
specific
decision
about
whether
to
reclassify
or
not,
you
know,
so--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--at
that
time
it
was
not.
it
is
now.
at
that
time
it
was
not.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
at
the
time--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--at
the
time
that
mr.
harper
was
brought
back,
everyone
in
his
similar
situation
was
brought
back
in.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
that
is
not
the
case
now.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
well,
there
were
no
options
as
far
as,
if
you
consider
the
options
stay
out
or
come
in.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
well,
like
you,
i'm
somewhat
troubled
by
that
language,
that
i
think
perhaps
it
could
refer
to
other
types
of
options
once
he's
back
within
the
prison.
you
know,
whether...
which
institution
he's
going
to
be
placed
at,
whether
he's
going
to
be
at
a
minimum
security
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
or
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state.
you
know,
other
types
of
restrictions
that
may
be
placed
on
him.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
do
you
mean,
what
is
the
rationale
behind
the
change,
or--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--there
has
been
no
change
in
the
state
statute
with
regard
to
that.
there's
been
one
slight
change
in
the
statute
which
deals
with
educational
programs
that--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--right.
there--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--i
don't
know
that
there's
anything
as
a
matter
of
law.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
it's
a
matter
of
administrative
policy,
which
is
really
my
point
here,
the
point
we're
trying
to
make
in
this
case.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
no.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
a
review
board
in
the
department
of
corrections
is
making
the
decision.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
again,
there
are
no
specific
statutory
or
regulatory
guidelines,
but
they--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--one--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--it
might
would
function
as
that,
but
i
think
the
question
here
is
whether
there's
a
liberty
interest
in
this
program
such
that
he's
required
to
have
a
hearing,
and--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--there
would
be
an
argument...
there
would
be...
under
meachum
v.
fano
i
keep
coming
back
to,
but
that
case
discussed
the
fact
that
when
you're
dealing
with
classification
systems
like
this
one
is,
that
there's
no...
that
there's
no
right
to
participate
in
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
reclassify.
it's
purely--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
morrissey
v.
brewer
opinion
closely
to
determine
whether
we
do
really
fall
under
morrissey,
and
there
are
several--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--i
would
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
we
also...
and
the
court
talks
about
this
in
morrissey,
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
function
of
the
program.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
that's
exactly
the
point
i
wanted
to
make,
your
honor,
that
when
morrissey
talked
about
parole,
morrissey
talked
about
the
fact
that
parole
had
been
around
for
60
years,
it
was
a
well-established
part
of
the
penal
system,
and
that--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--the
system
they
now...
the
state
now
has
in
place
still
does
not
entitle
the
inmate
to
a
hearing;
so,
you
know,
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
a
morrissey--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--no.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
no,
it
does
not.
it
allows
the
inmate
to
stay
out
for
a
certain
time
before
the
department
of
corrections
makes
a
decision
to
bring
him
back
in,
but
the
new
system
does
not
entitle
him
to
a
hearing.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
if
this
court
thought--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--if
you
thought
that
it
was
like
parole
such
that
morrissey
applied,
then
i
think
we
would
have
a
hard
time
defending
that
system.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i
would
agree
with
that,
that
first
you
have
to
find
a
liberty
interest.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i
will
answer
that
question
and
then
i'd
like
to
also
make
a
couple
of
other
comments.
from
the
standpoint
of
someone
out
of
jail,
like
mr.
harper--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--there
are
several
differences.
one,
mr.
harper
is
still
bound
by
the
prison
disciplinary
proceedings,
so
if
he
commits
some
sort
of
disciplinary
violation
while
he's
out
on
pre-parole,
just
something
that
would
be
a
disciplinary
misconduct
in
the
prison,
like
a
disrespect
to
his
supervising
parole
officers,
then
he
can
be
charged
with
a
disciplinary
violation
and
earned
credits
can
be
taken
away.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
there's
no
provision
for
that.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
under
parole,
you're
either
revoked
or
you're...
there
are
no
provisions--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--exactly.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
another
important...
i
think
a
real
important
point
to
make
is
that
prisoners
on
this
pre-parole
conditional
supervision
program
are
earning
earned
credits
within
our
department
of
corrections.
some
states
call
them
good
time
credits.
we
have
a
system
where
you're
placed
on
a
certain
level,
and
you
may
earn
an
additional
44
days
or
33
days
or
22
days
based
on
things
like
the
management
of
your
living
space
and
hygiene,
participation
in
an
education
program,
or
a
job--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--right.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
no.
people
on
parole
do
not
earn
those.
again--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--there
may
be
additional
options,
depending
upon--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--well,
the
distinction,
i
believe,
is
the
fact
that
these...
the
things
that
i
were
mentioning
to
justice
stevens
show
that
this
inmate,
people
on
pre-parole
are
continuing
to
serve
their
sentence
under
the
department
of
corrections.
with
a
parole
program,
yes,
the
parole
officer
could
put
additional
burdens
on
a
parolee
if
it
was
in...
if
it
was
within
the
rules
and
conditions
which
were
originally
imposed
upon
him.
they
couldn't
go
outside
those
rules
and
conditions,
but
if
they
were
within
those
rules
and
conditions
they
could
put
additional
burdens
on
him,
but
not
the
type
of
burdens
that
would
be
given
to
an
inmate
in
a
prison,
which
is
what
people
on
pre-parole
have.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
it's
administered
by
our
department
of
corrections.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
it's...
the
pardon
and
parole
board
recommends
people
for
parole,
and
they
ultimately
do
administer
that--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--parole
officers
would
report
that
to
the
pardon
and
parole
board.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
yes.
there
are
some
overlaps,
and
like
in
this
situation,
people
on
pre-parole,
they're
supervised
by
parole
officers,
and
they're
employees
of
the
department
of
corrections,
so
there's
some
overlap
between
the
two
departments.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
the
specific
employee
might
be
the
same.
they're
both
parole
officers.
but
that's
just
an
ease
of
function
with
our
department
of
corrections,
is
that
they
use
these
parole
officers
for
performing
these
functions,
but
they
still
report
to
the
department
of
corrections
as
opposed
to
the
pardon
and
parole--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--the
department
of
corrections,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
no.
all
they
do
is
recommend
people
for
placement
on
the
program.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
that
gets
us
to
the
point
that
this
court
recently
made
in
sandin,
which
is
that
you
don't
look
at
language
like
that
and
pick
it
apart
in
a
mechanical
manner.
you
look
to
the
nature
of
the
program,
and
here,
yes,
there
is
some
language
saying
you
will
be
removed
or
you
may
be
removed
if
you
don't
abide
with
the
educational
rules--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--but
that
doesn't
leave
an
implication
that
you
may
not
be
removed
for
any
other
reason,
and
that's
exactly
what
this
court
was
talking
about
most
recently
in--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--in...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
we're
describing
the
program
as
a
reclassification
system.
when
the
inmate
goes
on
the
program,
he
signs
the
forms,
the
orientation
that
he
signed...
joint
appendix
page
4,
specifically
on
page
6.
the
inmate
knew
that
he
was
being
classified
at
a
community
level.
that
is
a
type
of
classification.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
again,
i
would
admit
to
you
there's
no
specific
language
i
can
point
to
that
says--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--general
language
that
he's
on
a
community
level.
general
language
that
this
case
fits
within
meachum
v.
fano,
which
deals
with--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--we
also
have
a
statute,
title
57,
section
512,
which
says
that
the
prison
officials
may
transfer
between
institutions.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
exactly.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
well,
it...
the
restrictions
that
were
placed
on
the
inmate
were
such
that
it
is
a
type
of
confinement.
with
parole,
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
parole
is
an
established
part
of
the
penal
system.
the
purpose
of
it,
everyone
knew
in
morrissey
v.
brewer
that
the
purpose
of
parole
was
to
reintegrate
people
into
society.
here,
this
program
is
implemented
for
overcrowding.
it
was
implemented
not
because
it
was
a
integral
part
of
any
penalogical
system,
but
implemented
for
a
specific
purpose.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
as
i
was
mentioning
earlier,
if
he
escapes,
then
he's
subject
to
escape
charges,
criminal
charges
for
escape.
that's
different
than
a
parolee.
he's
subject
to
the
disciplinary
proceedings
of
the
department
of
corrections...
different
from
a
parolee.
if
he
needs
medical
treatment
and
wishes
to
have
it
paid
for,
he
may...
he
can
go
back
into
an
institution
and
have
that
medical
treatment.
that's
different
from
a
parolee.
also,
earning
the
credits
and
getting
not
only
the
time
that
he's
out
serving
his
sentence
but
also
additional
time
for
credits.
with
parole,
in
oklahoma
a
parolee
gets
credit
for
time
that
he's
out
on
parole
credited
towards
his
sentence,
his
flat
time.
that,
if
a
parolee's
sentence
is
revoked
and
he's
brought
back
in,
he
may
or
may
not
get
credit
for
that
time
that
he's
been
out
serving,
so
if
a
parolee,
say,
has
a
10-year
sentence
and
after
8
he's
out,
and
he
has
a
2-year
suspended
sentence--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--if
you're
talking
about
day-to-day
functions
like,
you
know,
visiting
with
his
family
and,
you
know,
going
on
about--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--then
i
can't
think
of
anything
specific
in
a
day-to-day--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--he...
the
medical...
i
wanted
to
make
a
point
about
if
he
needs
medical
treatment
he
has
to
go
back
in
for
it.
he
can't
leave
the
state--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--not
unless
his
parole
were
revoked.
i
mean,
the
department--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--yes.
if
he
wants
to
be
willing
to
have
his
parole
revoked
i
suppose
he
could,
and--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--he
cannot
leave
the
state.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
a
parolee
can
leave
the
state
with
permission.
someone
on
the
pre-parole
program
cannot
even
leave
the
state
with
permission.
they
can
only
leave
the
county
with
permission.
so
there
are
several
ways--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--there
are
certain
things
about
the
program,
if
you
just
look
at
one
isolated
portion
like
that,
that
make
it
appear
to
be
better,
but
overall,
when
you
look
at
the
true
nature
of
the
program--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--right.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
exactly.
better
off
than
many
of
us
on
some
occasions.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
a
parolee
is
technically
released
from
his
sentence
of
imprisonment.
his
sentence
is
suspended
while
he's
on
parole,
and
a
person
on
the
pre-parole
program
is
continuing
to
serve
his
sentence.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i
don't
know
that
he's--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--that
he's...
oh,
physically
confined
to
the
state.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
yes,
he
is.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
right.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
well,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
program,
i'd
say
about
a
year
generally,
if
they
continue
on
the
program,
because
pre-parole
is
considered
a
year
earlier
than
parole
is
considered.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
there
may
be
people
like
that
now.
there
were
no
people
at
the
time
mr.
harper
was
brought
back
in,
but
now
there
may
be
such
people,
yes.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
about...
at
this
time
i
would
say
about
1,200
or
so
are
probably
on
the
program.
again,
there's
nothing
specific
in
the
record
dealing
with
that.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
again,
i
hate
to
keep
saying
this,
but
there's
nothing
in
our
statute
which
sets
forth
what
considerations
the
parole
board
should
make.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
certain
people
are--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--not
specifically,
no.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i
think
one
reason
that
we
would
know
that
is
that
with
pre-parole
we
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
program,
which
is
to
alleviate
overcrowding.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
not
automatically,
but
they
may
be
given
pre-parole--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--they
certainly
may
consider
that,
and...
but
i...
but
they
are
not
required
to
consider
that.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
it
might
be
permissible,
but
there
are
no
specific
guidelines
for
when--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--it
possibly
could,
but--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--with
this
program--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--it
was
the
focus
of
the
program.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
and
in
doing
that,
they
might
have
to
consider
who
best
to
let
out.
if
they
know
they're
going
to
let
out
a
certain
number
of
people,
then
they
might
let
out
the
people
who
are
less
of
a
danger
to
society,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--right.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
or
the
double
murderer
such
as
mr.
harper.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
i'm
not
aware
of
any
situations
where
they've
done
that,
because
to
this
point
we've
never
had
any
extra
cells,
but
i
think
pursuant
to
our
program
we
could,
if
the
department
of
corrections
chose
to
do
that.
when
it
got
to
the
point
to
where
the
prison
was
no
longer
crowded,
they--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--they
may
be
left
out
for
90
days
and
then
still
a
determination
is
made
whether
to
bring
them
back
or
not,
but
they're
still
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
at
that--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--refusing
to
be
considered,
or
deciding
not
to
be
considered
for
parole.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
it
gets
back
to
the
point
that
justice
stevens
was
making
earlier,
that
there
are
some
situations
where
pre-parole
is
more
advantageous,
and
because
a
defendant
is
earning
credits
while
he's
out
on
pre-parole,
in
addition
to
flat
time
served,
he
may
get
out
earlier
on
pre-parole--
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
--that's
to
prevent
the
situation,
as
an
inmate,
trying
to
manipulate
the
system
that
way,
staying
out
on
pre-parole
rather
than
being
placed
on
parole,
where
society
would
have
their
interests
filled
by
having
him
in
a
program
where
he's
being
rehabilitated
into
society.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
exactly.
one
point
i
want
to
make,
too,
is
that
the
inmate's
understanding
of
what
he
will
and
won't
get
from
the
program
is
not
the
critical
factor
here.
this
court
discussed
that
in
sandin.
this
court
discussed
it
in
connecticut
v.
dumschat.
the
court
also
discussed
that
in
jago,
jago,
v.
van
kirrin.
in
jago,
they
had
told
an
inmate
that
he
would
get
out
on
parole,
and
then
later
the
department
of
corrections
determined
that
no,
they
wouldn't
let
him
out,
and
the
court
said
that
even
though
there
was
a
mutually
explicit
understanding
that
he
would
get
out,
that
that
did
not
give
him
a
liberty
interest
in
the
program.
the
same
thing
with
the
connecticut
v.
dumschat
case.
also,
as
my
time
runs
down
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
the
purpose
of
this
program
is
a
prison
administrative
program.
it's
to
deal
with
problems
that
are
inherent
in
the
prison,
and
this
court
was
very
specific
in
sandin
that
federal
courts
should
stay
out
of
the
day-to-day
management
of
prisons.
we
need
to
be
able
to
have
as
much
opportunity
as
we
can
with
this
programs
in
order
to
experiment
and
try
different
things.
you
know,
we
used
to...
we
brought
people
back
in
automatically
if
parole
was
denied.
now
we
leave
them
out
90
days,
or
maybe
even
a
longer
period
of
time.
that
is
a
function
of
the
program,
and
the
prison
administrators
are
the
proper
ones
to
make
that
determination
on
what
do
we
need
to
do
with
these
type
of
programs.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time...
which
i
don't
have.
ms.
sandra
d.
howard
thank
you.
