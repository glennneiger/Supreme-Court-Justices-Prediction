justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
howard,
did
the
state
have
any
procedures
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
arose
for
a
situation
like
this
where
one
group
permitted
the
preparole
but
then
the
governor
subsequently
denied
parole?
were
there
any
written
procedures
in
place
for
that
situation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
this
case
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
answer
is
there
wasn't
anything
that
covered
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
subsequently
the
state
has
adopted
some
procedures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
it's
discretionary
with
the
board
whether
to
terminate
it,
the
pre-parole,
simply
because
the
governor
had
denied
parole?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
on
what
basis
do
they
now
make
that
decision?
is
it
just
totally
discretionary--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--with
the
department,
or
do
they
consider
how
the
prisoner
has
behaved
on
pre-parole?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there...
you
then
take
it
that
the
claim
before
us
today
doesn't
carry
a
substantive
component
to
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
you
go
through
the
motions
of
a
hearing,
but
then
they
can
flip
a
coin.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
gives
them
due
process.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
decided
here,
at
least
a
majority
were
to
conclude
that
it
is
most
closely
analogous
to
parole,
and
therefore
morrissey
is
some...
it's
applicable
in
some
respect,
do
you
think
the
system
the
state
now
has
in
place
would
suffice
if
the
ultimate
decision
is
arbitrarily
decided?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
new
system
does
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--give
the
inmate
a
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
this
court
thought
that
morrissey
were
applicable,
do
you
defend
that
system?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
thought
that
it
was
analogous
to
parole.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
parole
board
consider
different
factors
in
determining
whether
a
particular
prisoner
should
get
pre-parole,
such
as
whether
he
will
be
a
threat
if
put
on
pre-parole
to
society,
and
his
chances
of
meeting
the
requirements
and
so
forth?
do
they
consider
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
about
what
they
consider
for
parole?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
anything
in
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
have
any
reason
to
know
whether
they
consider
the
same
or
different
factors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
even
if
it's
a
triple
ax
murderer,
you'd
automatically
give
them
pre-parole?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
wouldn't
consider,
you
think,
whether
they're
going
to
be
a
threat
on
release?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wait
a
minute.
what
if
the
statute
itself
expressly
said,
denial
of
parole
subsequent
to
having
been
granted
pre-parole
status
is
sufficient,
in
and
of
itself,
to
be
grounds
for
removal
from
that
status?
suppose
the
statute
said
it
just
that
way.
would
you
be
here?
would
you
have
a
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
suggestion
being
made
to
you
is
it
is
the
same
case
as
when
an
oklahoma
court
says
that
is
what
state
law
is.
how
do
you
have
a
case
if
you
wouldn't
have
under
a
statute
that
said
it
expressly
when
you
have
an
oklahoma
court
decision
that
that's
the
oklahoma
law?
i
think
that's
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
do
have
this
opinion
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
denied
the
respondent's
writ
of
habeas
at
the
state
level
saying,
dispositive
of
the
issue
in
petitioner's
case
is
the
fact
that
he
was
not
granted
parole
by
the
governor.
it
is
for
this,
not
a
disciplinary
reason,
he
was
removed
from
the
pre-parole
program.
so
do
we
interpret
that
as
meaning
that
the
criminal
appeals
court
thought
that
not
being
granted
parole
was
a
valid
and
sufficient
reason
for
revocation
of
pre-parole
status,
and
that
in
this
very
case
that
was
the
reason?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
oklahoma
court
is
saying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
read
it
that
way
anyway?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
court
understood
that
dispositive
of
the
habeas
petition
in
this
very
case
is
the
fact
that
he
was
not
granted,
eventually,
parole
by
the
governor,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
his
status
was
revoked,
not
for
some
disciplinary
reason
or
some
other
reason.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
if
we
interpret
that...
not
you.
what
if
we,
this
court
thinks
that
that
constitutes
a
valid
explanation
of
what
the
state
law
was
at
the
time
of
this
revocation?
