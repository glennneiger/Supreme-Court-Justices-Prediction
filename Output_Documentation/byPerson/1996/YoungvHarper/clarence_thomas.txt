justice
clarence
thomas
this
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
state
of
oklahoma
operated
two
programs
by
which
prisoners
were
released
before
the
expiration
of
their
sentences.
one
was
parole,
the
other
was
called
a
preparole
program,
full
name,
preparole
conditional
supervision
program.
with
respect
to
the
traditional
parole
program,
an
inmate
could
be
paroled
if
one
third
of
his
sentence
had
expired
and
if
the
governor
on
the
pardon
and
parole’s
recommendation
granted
parole.
with
respect
to
preparole,
the
board
itself,
could
grant
preparole
when
oklahoma’s
prisons
were
overcrowded
and
two,
the
prisoner
had
served
15%
of
his
sentence
or
her
sentence.
the
conditions
under
which
parolees
and
preparolees
were
released
were
essentially
identical.
respondent
was
released
on
a
preparole
program
after
serving
15
years
of
a
life
sentence.
after
five,
apparently,
uneventful
months
on
the
program,
the
governor
of
oklahoma
denied
him
parole
and
he
was
promptly
reincarcerated.
he
filed
a
state
habeas
corpus
petition
contending
that
his
summary
return
to
prison
violated
the
procedural
protection
set
forth
in
our
decision
in
morrissey
versus
brewer.
the
state
trial
and
appellate
courts
denied
habeas
relief
as
did
the
federal
district
court.
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
concluding
that
preparole
was
enough
like
parole
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
the
procedures
set
out
in
morrissey.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
preparole
as
it
existed
when
responded
was
released
was
equivalent
to
parole
as
understoodin
morrissey.
indeed,
it
appears
to
have
different
in
parole
in
name
only.
while
the
respondent’s
liberty
went
on
preparole
was
not
unconditional,
its
limitations
were
can,
if
not
identical
to
the
limitations
on
a
parolee’s
release.
in
morrissey
we
held
that
such
limitations
did
not
render
a
parolee's
liberty
beyond
procedural
protection.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
