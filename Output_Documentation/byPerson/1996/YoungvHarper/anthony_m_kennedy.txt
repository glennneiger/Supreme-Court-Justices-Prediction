justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
they
flip
a
coin?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
oklahoma
law
you
would
advise
the
board
that
they
can
flip
a
coin?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
take
it...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
a
parolee
is
subject
to
a
certain
amount
of
increased
restrictions
if
he
seems
to
be
not
quite
adjusting
to
the
instructions
of
the
parole.
he'd
say,
you
have
to
report
to
me
three
times
a
week,
instead
of
once
a
week.
you
must
be
home
at
night.
you
can't
go
out
at
night.
so
there
are,
it
seems
to
me,
all
sorts
of
options
that
the
parole
officer
has,
short
of
revocation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
that
distinction
between
your
pre-parolee
respondent
here
and
the
parolee
in
the
standard
parole
case
doesn't
seem
to
hold
up
in
your
answer
to
justice
stevens.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
am
not
quite
clear
on
the
reasons
that
this
respondent
could
have
been
brought
back
at
the...
under
the
regulations
then
in
force.
at
page
18
and
19
of
your
brief,
19...
the
bottom
of
page
18,
you
said,
an
inmate
on
the
program
is
aware
that
he
may
be
reclassified
to
a
higher
security
level...
i
assume
that
means
being
brought
back
into
the
facility...
for
any
reason,
including
that
the
governor
denied
the
inmate
for
parole,
that
he
no
longer
meets
eligibility
requirements,
whether
he
violated
a
rule.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
means
that
there
must
be
some
reason
given.
if
you
said
for
any
reason
at
all,
including
flipping
a
coin,
you
wouldn't
need
those
three...
those
three
classifications.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
two
things,
you
may
be
removed,
which
indicates
there's
some
discretion,
for
a
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
i
don't
know
why
you
described
the
program
in
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
your
description
is
completely
unnecessary
if
no
reason
at
all
is
necessary
to
be
given.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
with
counsel
for
the
state
that
pre-parole
can
be
revoked
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
at
all...
that
pre-parole
can
be
revoked,
that
the
respondent
can
be
told
to
report
to
correction
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
at
all?
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
tried
to
find
out
from
opposing
counsel,
the
counsel
for
the
state
of
oklahoma,
the
grounds
upon
which
pre-parole
could
be
revoked,
and
i
thought
the
answer
was
any
reason
at
all.
you
can
flip
a
coin.
the
corrections
board
can
say,
i'm
bored.
we're
not
going
to...
we'll
just
revoke
all
these
people.
we
don't
want
to
read
all
these
papers.
do
you
agree
that
that
is
the
proper
description
of
the
duties
of
the
corrections
board
under
this
program,
that
they
can
revoke
for
no
reason
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
with
that
interpretation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
apart
from
due
process,
under
state
law,
are
there
any
principles
that
guide
the
board
of
corrections
in
determining
to
revoke
pre-parole
status?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
agree...
would
you
agree
that
the
board
of
corrections
can
give
no
reason
at
all,
say,
well,
we're...
i'm
bored
today.
i
don't
want
to
read
these
papers.
i'm
just
going
to
revoke
all
the
parole.
i'm
not
going
to
go
through
this
paperwork.
could
he
do
that,
the
corrections
officer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
under
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
they
would
suggest
the
opposite,
and
i
think
the
form
that
is
set
forth
at
pages
4,
5,
and
6
of
the
joint
appendix
indicates
that
he
has
a
certain
expectation...
that's
the
word
the
form
used...
that
he
is
expected
to
be
in
compliance
with
all
of
these
rules,
which
would
indicate
to
me
that
under
the
state's
procedure,
discretion
has
certain
boundaries.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
the
purpose
of
the
90-day----
--and
in
support
of
that
you
quote
from
page
11...
41a
of
the
opinion,
the
last
paragraph,
where
it
says
the
governor's...
where
it
says,
we
believe
such
a
procedure
gives
an
inmate
sufficient
notice
when
he
is
placed
on
the
program
that
he
may
be
removed
from
it
when
the
governor
exercises
his
discretion.
