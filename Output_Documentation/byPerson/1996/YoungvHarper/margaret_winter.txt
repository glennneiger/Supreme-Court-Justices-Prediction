ms.
margaret
winter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
morrissey
v.
brewer
the
court
examined
the
nature
of
a
parolee's
interest
in
his
continued
liberty.
the
court
defined
parole
as
follows:
the
essence
of
parole
is
release
from
prison
before
completion
of
sentence
on
condition
that
the
prisoner
abide
by
certain
rules
during
the
balance
of
the
sentence.
the
court
decided
that
even
though
the
parolee's
liberty
is
only
partial
and
conditional,
nevertheless
it
includes
many
of
the
core
values
of
unconditional
liberty.
ms.
margaret
winter
no.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes,
i
agree,
and
what
we
are
really
saying
is,
is
that
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
they
have
created
two
programs,
two
parole
programs,
both
of
which
fall
well
within
the
parameters
discussed
in
morrissey.
one
of
these
programs
they
all
parole,
and
the
newer
program
they
call
the
pre-parole
conditional
supervision
program.
the
eligibility
requirements
are
identical
for
the
two
programs,
with
the
exception
that
a
prisoner
can
qualify
a
little
bit
earlier
for
pre-parole
than
for
parole,
and
the--
ms.
margaret
winter
--no.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
understanding
the
question.
we--
ms.
margaret
winter
--that
statute
doesn't
say.
that's
the
way
the
state
is
interpreting
it,
and--
ms.
margaret
winter
--i
don't
know
exactly
what
your
honor
is
asking.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
regulations
they
say
that
they
are
making
a
decision.
if
they're
making
a
decision,
that
has
certain
due
process
implications.
ms.
margaret
winter
in...
this
case
was
heard
in
state
court.
there
was
never
any...
that
issue
never
came
up,
because
this
is
a
very
new
claim
of
the
state,
that
they
can
revoke
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
in
state--
ms.
margaret
winter
--well,
we're
here
to
see
that
he
can't
do
that.
i
don't--
ms.
margaret
winter
--there
is...
the
statute
doesn't
speak
to
this.
the
regulations
don't
say,
it
can
be
revoked
for
any
reason
or
no
reason.
the
regulations...
the
only
existing
regulations
that
have
ever
been
promulgated
in
the
state,
either
by
the
department
of
corrections
or
by
the
pardon
and
parole
board,
would
suggest
the
opposite.
ms.
margaret
winter
under
the
form
that
mr.
harper
signed,
the
time...
the
form
that
was
used
at
the
time
he
was
let
out,
the
last
thing
he's
expected
to
sign
off
on
after
having
been
given
all
the
rules
and
procedures
is
a
statement,
i
understand
that
my
being
released
into
the
community
is
dependent
upon
my
compliance
with
all
of
these
expectations,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
at
the
time
that
he
was
released,
at
least
the
department
of
corrections
and
the
parole
board
understood
that
they
couldn't
do
it
for
any
reason
or
no
reason.
ms.
margaret
winter
well,
you
see--
ms.
margaret
winter
--it
seems
to
me
that
what
the--
ms.
margaret
winter
--it
certainly
would
be
useless.
there
would
be
no
point
at
all
if
they
could
bring
them
back,
if
under
the
constitution
they
could
bring
them
back
for
any
reason
or
no
reason.
ms.
margaret
winter
no--
ms.
margaret
winter
--i
believe--
ms.
margaret
winter
--the
court
may
be
looking
at
the
district,
the
u.s.
district
court
opinion.
ms.
margaret
winter
i...
looking
at
everything
that
the
court
of
appeals
says,
they
say
that
we
believe
that
the
procedure,
that
is,
the
procedure
that
says--
ms.
margaret
winter
--no,
the--
ms.
margaret
winter
--court
of
criminal
appeals.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes,
but
it
seems
to--
ms.
margaret
winter
--that's
correct.
ms.
margaret
winter
that's
correct.
ms.
margaret
winter
that's--
ms.
margaret
winter
--i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
the
court
of
criminal--
ms.
margaret
winter
--yes.
ms.
margaret
winter
correct.
ms.
margaret
winter
there's
a...
the
purpose
of
having
a
hearing
here
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
is
in
morrissey.
that
is,
here,
the
triggering
event
for
a
hearing,
they
say
now,
can
be
the
governor
refuses
to
grant
parole.
that
becomes--
ms.
margaret
winter
--that's
fine.
we
won't
quarrel
with
that.
when
the
governor
denies
parole
under
this
framework,
that
becomes
a
triggering
event
for
a
hearing,
but--
ms.
margaret
winter
--that
would
be
a
different
case.
ms.
margaret
winter
but
i
think
there
is.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said,
and
the
attorney
general
relies
on
it,
they
said
that
what
this
framework
provides
is
that
he
may
be
brought
back
in,
which
means
that
a
determination
is
being
made.
ms.
margaret
winter
but--
ms.
margaret
winter
--why
don't
we
assume
that
it
is
a
sufficient
reason,
just
as
a
parole
violation
is
a
sufficient
reason,
but
the
court
doesn't
stop...
the
court
says
you
can't
stop
with
a
sufficient
reason.
once
you--
ms.
margaret
winter
--i
think
that
that
would
be
a
different
case.
ms.
margaret
winter
would
you
mind
posing
the
question
to
me
again?
ms.
margaret
winter
the
assertion
that
it
wasn't
true
then
is
nothing
but
an
assertion.
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record,
it
seems
to
me...
i
don't
see
it
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
opinion
or
anywhere
else.
ms.
margaret
winter
i
would
agree.
ms.
margaret
winter
i
do
have
one
caveat.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
you
could
have
a
problem,
a
substantive
due
process
problem,
in
having
automatic
revocation
for
a
reason
that
is
utterly
irrational
when
you're
talking
about
a
precious--
ms.
margaret
winter
--in
a
situation
like
this,
where
it
happens
quickly,
i
think
that
makes
it
like
a
furlough
problem
and
that
there's
no
problem
with
that.
the
statue
says
that.
ms.
margaret
winter
the
record
has
so
much
evidence,
including
a
dozen
statements
by
the
attorney
general
in
its
briefs.
it's
a
very...
it's
a
late
argument
that
the
statute
means
anything
other
than
that
it
is
discretionary.
there
are
literally
a
dozen
times
that
the
attorney
general
has
said
it
in
its
briefs
to
this
court
and
the
lower
court.
there
are
the
documents
that
mr.
harper
himself
signed
saying
that
there
were
options
in
the
event
of
parole,
and
saying
that
his
continuing
out
remained
on
his
compliance
with
conditions,
and
finally,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
statute
means,
whether
or
not
there's
discretion,
are
regulations...
a
number
of
sets
of
regulations
by
the
pardon
and
parole
board,
and
a
set
of
regulations
by
the
department
of
corrections
which
appears
in
the
appendix
to
their
cert
petition.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes,
that
that
was
not
the
policy.
ms.
margaret
winter
no,
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
that.
at
the
time
that
he
was
in
the
prison,
when
he
was
let
out
of
the
prison
the
record
is
completely
silent.
ms.
margaret
winter
well,
it
seems
to
me
that--
ms.
margaret
winter
--our
client
was
pro
se.
he
asked
for
an
evidentiary
hearing--
ms.
margaret
winter
--i
think
it
changes
the
burden
that
he
asked
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
in
the
federal
courts.
this
is
an
issue
that
is--
ms.
margaret
winter
--i'm
not
sure
that
it's...
i
think
that
the
pro
se
habeas
plaintiff
is
entitled
at
some
stage
to
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
ms.
margaret
winter
this
is
a
fact
that
at
the
time
was
not
disputed.
if
the
state
had
come
in
and
said
to
our
client,
which
they
did
not,
the
reason
we
brought
you
back
in
is
because
it's
mandatory,
everybody
is
being
brought
back
in,
he
could
have
tried
to
controvert
that.
he
could
have
answered
that.
instead,
they
argued
two
things
that
were
clearly
not
true.
one,
that
he
was
in
confinement,
and
that's
what
everyone's
fire
was
directed
at.
is
he
in
confinement?
is
he
in
prison?
and
two,
they
made
an
argument
that
was
so
palpably
untrue
that
no
one
could
accept
it,
namely
that
he
became
ineligible.
that
became
a
mantra
that
we
sometimes
heard,
but
we
know
from
the
statute
that
he
does
not
become
ineligible
for
pre-parole
once
parole
is
denied.
ms.
margaret
winter
no,
i
don't
think
it's
at
all
incredible.
i'm
only
saying
that
the
attorney
general
of
oklahoma
has
contradicted
that
position
many,
many
times
in
its
briefs
to
this
court
and
to
the
lower
courts,
and
that
it
never
asserted
its
automatic--
ms.
margaret
winter
--no.
it
became
put
in
a
bind
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
first
asserted
a
person
becomes
ineligible.
ms.
margaret
winter
no,
the--
ms.
margaret
winter
--criminal
appeals,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
in
an
interim
order,
which
is
in
the
record,
please
show
me
the...
i
want
to
see
the
law.
where
are
the
regulations
that
say
they
become
ineligible?
at
which
point
the
attorney
general
produced
004-11,
which
says
you
get
a
review
in
90
days,
making
it
clear
that
it
wasn't
mandatory.
that's
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
very
issue
it
was
interested
in,
and
that
is
the
document
the
attorney
general
gave
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
found
either
that
there
was
an
unvarying
practice
at
the
time,
because
that
factual
question
never,
never
arose
in
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
margaret
winter
it
simply
didn't
arise.
ms.
margaret
winter
a
half--
ms.
margaret
winter
--i
think
it's
not
too...
i'm
sure
there
could
be
grey
areas,
but
at
this
point
i've
seen
nothing
that's
a
seriously
grey
area.
a
half-way
house,
you're
still
in
prison.
you're
in
a
state
facility.
you're
not
in
your
own
home
or
in
your
own
bed,
and
you're
constantly--
ms.
margaret
winter
--that
could
be
different.
ms.
margaret
winter
that
it's
not
just
about
expectations,
it's
being
out
of
prison,
and
that
once
you've
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
prison
door
and
you
are
told
get
a
life,
get
a
job,
go
to
work,
pay
your
bills,
have
relations
with
other
human
beings,
have
friends
and
family
and
come
and
go
and
go
to
the
movies
and
to
the
grocery
store,
you
know
that
you're
not
in
prison,
and
when
you
know
that
you're
not
in
prison,
something
very
precious
has
happened,
and
it
shouldn't
be
taken
away
without
a
hearing.
that's
what
i
would
say,
and
i
know
when
i'm
in
a
half-way
house
that
i'm
still
in
prison,
and
it
may
be
that
when
i
have
a...
and
be
electronically
surveilled
all
day,
i
know
i'm
not
in...
i
know
that
i
am
in
prison,
because
something
of
the
essence
of
freedom
is
having
a
choice
to
obey
the
rules
or
not,
instead
of
because
every
minute
you're
being
electronically
surveilled
or
surveilled
by
a
guard.
this
is
a
man
who
knew
that
he
wasn't
in
prison,
and
that's
why
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing,
for
that
reason
and
because
the
state
retained
the
discretion
to
pick
and
choose,
to
send
some
people
back
to
prison
when
the
governor
denied
parole
and
to
let
others
stay
out.
ms.
margaret
winter
i
think
that
the
reason
it
doesn't
show
is
because
it's
a
newly
developed
theory
of
the
case.
ms.
margaret
winter
well,
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if,
in
1990,
when
ernest
harper
was
let
out
of
prison,
there
was
an
unvarying
practice
of
bringing
people
back
to
jail
when
parole
was
denied
by
the
governor,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
show
that
there
was
a
policy.
the
evidence
that
their...
the
evidence
that
they
think
that
they
have
discretion
to
do
it
is
in
the
later
enacted
regulations,
and
it
may
be
that
they
felt
like
bringing
everybody
back
in
last
week
and
this
week
they
feel
like
leaving
everybody
out,
but
they've
already
said
it's
the
toss
of
a
coin,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
kind
of
reasoning
shouldn't
be
determining
the
very
precious
right
that's
at
stake
here.
ms.
margaret
winter
it
could
be.
ms.
margaret
winter
that
was...
that
regulation
came
into
being
5
months
after
he
was
returned
to
prison
in
august,
i
believe.
ms.
margaret
winter
there
was
a
statutory
change
as
follows.
there
is
one...
and
there
was...
there's
been
a
couple
of
misstatements
of
the
record
that
i
would
like
to
clear
up
here,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
significance
of
this--
ms.
margaret
winter
--it's
one
that
says...
there's
an
identical
provision
for
both
parolees
and
pre-parolees,
and
i
believe
they
were
enacted
at
the
same
time,
and
that
provision
says,
if
you
don't
keep
up
with
the
educational
and
job
requirements
that
we
put
on
you
as
a
condition,
you
will
become
ineligible
for
parole,
and
that's
the
only
thing--
ms.
margaret
winter
--no,
neither
before
nor
after.
one
other
thing--
ms.
margaret
winter
--yes.
ms.
margaret
winter
i
believe
that
what
they're
saying
is
that
it
is...
they
are--
ms.
margaret
winter
--may
i...
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i'm
understanding
the
question.
i
do
not
believe
that
what
they're
saying
is,
you
must
be
brought
in,
that
they
did
not
understand
it
to
mean
that.
ms.
margaret
winter
they...
they
understood
it--
ms.
margaret
winter
--i
believe
that
i
misspoke
before--
ms.
margaret
winter
--then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
find...
you
should
say
that
the
state
law
denies
due
process,
and
that
people
must
have
a
hearing,
because--
ms.
margaret
winter
--yes.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes.
ms.
margaret
winter
in
parole...
a
person
can
admit
that
they
have
violated
a
condition
of
their
release
and
they're
still
entitled
to
a
hearing
because
there's
a
second
decision.
the
parole
board
is
exercising
discretion.
and
morrissey
says,
and
gagnon
says,
and
black
v.
romano...
it's
dictum,
but
it
goes
on
at
considerable
length...
says,
once
you're
exercising...
that's
just
the
first
step,
did
he
violate
parole,
because
if
they
can
say
he
violated
but
we'll
leave
him
out,
then
you
want
to
have
a
chance
to
argue
that
you
should
be
one
of
those
people
who--
ms.
margaret
winter
--no,
not
at
all,
justice
souter,
because
there's
a
huge
difference
between
parole...
refusal
to
grant
someone
parole
and
bringing
them
back
into
prison.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes.
ms.
margaret
winter
exactly.
ms.
margaret
winter
yes,
exactly.
i
believe
that
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
understood
it
to
be
discretionary.
