justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
there
people
who
were
released
for
a
year
before
their
consideration
of
parole,
and
then
parole
was
denied,
who
have
remained
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
many
people
would
you
say
approximately
are
on
this
program?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
would
they
do
the
same--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
would
they
do
the
same
thing
in
bringing
people
back?
that
is,
suppose
they
now
get
some
extra
cells
free,
do
they
now
bring
people
back
because
they
say,
we
don't
need
all
these
people
out
there
any
more.
we
have
some
extra
cells,
and
there
are
a
few
people
who
have
done
worse
things
than
others,
and
we're
going
to
bring
them
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
why
on
that
very
point...
i...
there's
a
state
court
finding
here
that
the
reason
that
your
client
was
removed
from
the
program
was
because
he
was
not
granted
parole
by
the
governor
of
oklahoma,
and
they
found
that,
i
guess,
in
judge
lumpkin's
opinion,
dispositive
of
the
issue
is
the
fact
he
was
not
granted
parole
by
the
governor
of
oklahoma,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
says.
i'm
reading
it
on
page
40a
of
the
record.
it
says,
dispositive...
maybe
it's
a
different
case
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
40a
of
your...
of
their
petition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
looking
at
page
40a
of
the
appendix,
where
it
says,
gary
lumpkin,
the
presiding...
maybe
it's
a
different
case,
or--
--the
white
brief?
yes,
the
white
brief.
maybe...
is
this
the
district
court?
well,
my
question
is
this.
i
read
that,
and
i
thought
that
the
reason
they...
we
have
a
finding
here,
what
i
thought
was...
it
says
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma,
order
denying
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it's
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
what
it
says
when
i
read
it...
maybe
i'm
asking
this
because
you
can
clarify
it
for
me...
is
it
says,
dispositive
of
the
issue
in
petitioner's
case
is
the
fact
he
was
not
granted
parole
by
the
governor
of
oklahoma.
it
is
for
this,
not
a
disciplinary
reason,
that
he
was
removed
from
the
program.
so
i
thought
everybody
agrees
to
that,
that...
that's...
am
i
right?
is
that
right,
or
am
i
mixing
it
up,
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
asking
about
procedure.
this
is...
are
you
talking...
when
you
say
court
of
appeals,
are
you
talking
about
the
tenth
circuit
or
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
i'm
saying...
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is...
is,
isn't
it...
what
seems
to
be
true
is
that
he's
saying,
this
judge,
that
the
reason
that
your
client
was
removed
from
the
program
was
because
he
was
not
granted
parole
by
the
governor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now...
all
right.
if
that's
so,
i
don't
think
your
client
disputes
that
he
was
not
granted
parole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
is...
the
basic
rule,
i
thought,
of
the
due
process
law,
it's
so
basic
that
nobody
ever
says
it,
that
you
don't
have
to
have
a
hearing
under
the
constitution
or
any
other
rule
if
there's
nothing
to
have
a
hearing
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
if,
in
fact,
he
was
removed
because
he
wasn't
given
parole,
and
if
that
isn't
in
dispute,
what
would
there
possibly
be
in
this
case
to
have
a
hearing
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
it
isn't
what
they
said.
all
i
want
to
know
is,
is
if
the
underlying
facts
are
correct,
that
it
is
that
he
was
removed,
that
there
was
a
finding
in
this
court,
a
state
court,
that
the
reason
his
pp,
whatever
it
is,
was
revoked
is
because
he
wasn't
given
a
parole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
correct,
and
he
doesn't
dispute
that,
then
what
is
there
to
have
a
hearing
about,
and
if
there
is
nothing
to
have
a
hearing
about,
where
in
the
constitution
does
it
require
a
court
or
an
agency
or
anyone
to
have
a
hearing
when
there
is
nothing
to
have
a
hearing
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
says
that
parole
revocation
is
a
necess...
there
might
be
other
reasons
why
you
might
revoke
a
person's
pre-parole.
what
i
take
it
is
the
case
here
is
that
this
would
be
a
sufficient
reason
under
oklahoma
law.
you
have
a
judge
of
oklahoma
suggesting
in
the
paragraph
that
it
is
a
sufficient
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--under
oklahoma
law.
it's
not
true
under
oklahoma
law
at
that
time
that
it
was
a
sufficient
reason
to
revoke
his
ppcs?
what
would
we
look
to
as
a
matter
of
oklahoma
law
to
establish
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
the
same...
i
mean,
to
add
to
that
is,
of
course
you
might
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
if
it
were
in
dispute
as
to
whether
the
governor
had
in
fact
or
not
revoked
the
parole,
but
there
is
no
dispute--
--but
isn't
there
another
factor
everybody's
overlooking?
the
oklahoma
procedure
spelled
out
in
41a
of
the
appendix
is
that
1)
the
inmate
is
denied
by
parole
by
the
governor,
but
their
cases
shall
be
reviewed
by
the
parole
board
90
days
from
denial
to
determine
whether
that
statute
will
be
continued,
indicating
that
the
denial
is
not...
it
may
be
a
sufficient
reason,
but
it's
not
always
a
sufficient
reason.
and
that's
true
now,
but
that
wasn't
true
then.
that's
the
new
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i've
another
question.
assuming...
for
this
i'm
assuming
you're
right
that
really
the
standard
was
vague,
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
for...
any
nonarbitrary,
nondiscriminatory,
nonprotected
reason
they
could
revoke
this.
all
right,
on
that
theory...
on
that
theory,
why
is
your
client
entitled
to
a
hearing?
to
be
quite
specific,
there
are
lots
of
things
called
intermediate
punishments
involving
half-way
houses,
involving
nights
and
weekends
in
prison,
involving
a
whole
host
of
experimental
things,
and
what
you've
heard
the
state
say
is,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
experiment
if
to
experiment
means
that
every
time
we
change
our
mind
about
any
person
we
have
to
go
through
some
tremendous
procedural
process.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your
response?
what
is
the...
which
of
those
half-way
intermediate
punishments,
in
your
view,
trigger
the
procedural
protection,
which
don't?
how
do
you
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
home
under
house
arrest
would
be
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
line
they
want
to
draw
is
a
line
which
says,
look
to
whether
authorities
have
retained
virtually
total
discretion
to
revoke
it.
under
those
circumstances,
the
prisoner
doesn't
have
an
expectation
of
remaining
free,
unlike
parole,
where
you're
releasing
the
prisoner,
giving
the
prisoner
an
expectation
of
remaining
free
but
for
certain
specified
circumstances.
now,
that's
their
line,
and
so
i'm
asking
you
what's
your
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
the
question.
