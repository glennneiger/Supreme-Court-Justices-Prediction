but
the
over-the-air...
the
question
that
i
have...
i'm
only
thinking
of
the
section
4.
i
think
maybe
the
section
5
is
different,
but
you
say
there
were
35,000
stations,
8,000
were
dropped,
but
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
of
the
8,000
that
were
dropped,
all
but
31
remained
on
the
air
broadcasting
to
the
over-the-air
people,
and...
so
that's
the
problem
that's
bothering
me.
if
7,700
of
the
8,000
are
still
there
broadcasting
to
the
people
you
said
were
trying
to
help,
namely
those
who
don't
have
cable,
then
how
were
those
people
hurt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
on
that,
for
the
reason
that,
of
course,
i
sought
evidence
in
the
record
of
economists
who
said,
if
you
have
less
money,
you
will
put
on
less
expensive
programming,
while
at
the
same
time
the
station,
while
having
less
money,
will
then
direct
its
attention
to
the
minority,
namely
those
who
don't
have
cable.
so
the
programs
will
be
less
expensive,
but
they
may
be
aimed
more
directly
at
the
audience,
and
therefore
i
didn't
know...
i
looked
for
evidence,
and
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
tells
us
that
that
minority
that
doesn't
have
cable
actually
has
programming
that
it
finds
less
desirable?
i
saw
a
theory,
but
i
didn't
see
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
roger
knowles
said
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
have
less
money,
you
will
spend
less
on
programming.
i
didn't
see
anything
in
his
statement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might
be
that
if
i
no
longer
broadcast
to
the
8,000
people
who
have
cable,
and
i
can
only
broadcast
to
the
2,000
people
who
don't,
my
programming
will
be
aimed
more
at
what
those
2,000
want,
not
less.
these
are
empirical
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i
just
don't...
i
look
for
evidence,
and
i
can't
find
empirical
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
fcc's
efforts
to,
in
the
fifties,
sixties,
seventies,
to
get
the
broadcasters
to
have
news
and
public
service,
et
cetera,
also
in
your
view
are
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
nbc,
abc,
you
know,
all
the
networks
in
the
forties,
fifties,
sixties,
and
seventies,
the
fcc
encouraged
them
in
very
strong
ways
to
carry
news
and
public
service
broadcasting.
in
your
view,
was
that
also
unconstitutional?
