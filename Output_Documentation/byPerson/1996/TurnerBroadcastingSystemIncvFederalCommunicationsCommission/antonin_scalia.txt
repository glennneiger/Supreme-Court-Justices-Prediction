less
restrictive;
why?
because...
i
mean,
the
first
amendment
is
certainly
violated
when
you
are
compelled
to
say
something,
whether
or
not
you
had
intended
to
say
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
to
say
that
the
one
both
compels
you
to
say
what
you
don't
want
to
and
prevents
you
from
saying
what
you
were
about
to
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dellinger,
i...
general
dellinger,
i'm
sorry...
i
suppose
it
can
be
said
that
whenever
you
save
a
single
station
that
would
otherwise
go
out
of
business
you're
preserving
the
diversity,
in
a
sense,
but
i
thought
that
what
our
earlier
opinion
meant
was
that,
did
you
not
save
this
broadcaster,
or
the
ones
that
are
saved
by
this
legislation,
there
would
not
be
any
diversity,
period.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
matter
of
the
system
as
a
whole
not
having
multiple
voices,
not
merely
whether
you
would
lose
a
few
voices.
of
course
you
would.
i
think
everybody
concedes
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
conceded?
you
think
that
the
other
side
thinks--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
asserting
that
no
voices
would
be
lost
if
this
legislation
were
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but--
--can
you
quantify
that,
mr....
general
dellinger?
you
say
it
shows
that
over-the-air
broadcasters
will
suffer.
you
know,
how
many
and
to
what
extent?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
they
were
dropped,
how
many
were
left?
that's
what
goes
to
my
question.
how
many
communities
were
deprived
of
diversity
in
over-the-air
broadcasting
because...
you
know,
to
drop
one
over-the-air
station
from
new
york
city,
is
no
big
deal,
and
i
would
not
be
very
sympathetic
to
the
government's
claim
that
this
is
necessary
to
"preserve
diversity".
justice
antonin
scalia
most
communities
have
only
one
newspaper.
now,
could
the
government,
in
order
to
foster
diversity,
require
the
newspaper
to
carry
competitors?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
radio
spectrum,
is
that
what
the
cable
operators
have
that
newspapers
don't?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
saying
is
that
cable
is
a
natural
monopoly
because
nobody
else
is
going
to
put
in
a
piece
of
copper.
it's
the
same
with
newspapers.
it
has
been
shown
economically
that
in
any
market
it
will
tend
to
come
down
to
one
newspaper,
because
advertising
only
pays
for
the
newspaper
that...
i
really
don't
see
the
difference,
but
the
point
i'm
driving
at
here
is,
why
is
it
so
horrible
to
have
only
four
over-the-air
television
stations
when
our
country
resigns
itself
to
the
fact
that
most
communities
have
only
one
local
newspaper?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
the
prosperity
of
programmers
that
the
government
is
now
concerned
about,
not
just
their
continued
existence.
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
the
overwhelming
interest,
that
they
must
prosper?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
at
least...
the
government
at
least
thinks
that
expensive
programming
is
better
programming.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
may
be
those
that
think
that,
you
know,
talking
heads
are
better
than
blowing
up
buildings
or
things
like
that,
but
the
government
has
made
that
decision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
any
rate.
expensive
programming
is
better
programming,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
the
government's
interest
is
in
unending
multiplicity,
no
matter
how
many?
if
you
have
97,
the
government
has
an
interest,
a
significant
interest
in
100?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
read
that
as
saying,
at
least
one,
is
what
the
government--
justice
antonin
scalia
--considers
an
irreducible
minimum.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
rest
is
whatever
the
market
will
give
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
just
assuming
that
all
the
money
the
station
gets
will
be
spent
on
better
programming.
that
seems
to
me
a
very
unreasonable
assumption,
unless
you're
talking
about
exclusively
nonprofit
stations.
but
i
would
think
the
normal
assumption
is,
you
know,
any
additional
money
will
go
right
into
the
owner's
pockets,
except
to
the
extent
that
spending
it
on
better
programming
will
produce
yet
more
money,
and
i
don't
know
that
that's
ever
been--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
less
likely
that
it
will
be
spent
on
programming.
it
will
be
spent
to
cover
the
loss.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
also
your
position
that
it
goes
down
a
lot
easier
if
it
is
content-based--
[laughter]
--and
affects
first
amendment
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
content-based
but
doesn't
affect
first
amendment
rights,
no
problem.
