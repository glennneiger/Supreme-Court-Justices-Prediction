mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
explain
briefly
why
we
think
that
neither
of
the
interests
now
asserted
by
the
government
to
support
the
must-carry
law
justifies
the
burdens
that
it
imposes
on
speech.
the
first
argument,
that
the
law
merely
regulates
anticompetitive
conduct,
fails
for
two
reasons.
first,
just
as
the
government
can't
ban
all
fund-raising
on
the
ground
that
some
of
it
might
be
fraudulent,
here
the
government
can't
forbid
the
sort
of
protected
activity
at
issue,
choosing
what
speech
to
offer,
unless
it
shows
at
a
minimum
that
those
decisions
are
generally
anticompetitive
acts
and
thus
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment,
otherwise,
the
law
is
reaching
too
far
into
protected
activity
in
an
effort
to
get
at
unprotected
activity.
the
record,
however,
shows
that
cable
operators
voluntarily
carry
the
vast
majority
of
broadcast
stations,
those
accounting
for
some
98
percent
of
actual
viewing,
and
it
is
wholly
implausible
to
presume
that,
were
it
not
for
some
sort
of
anticompetitive
bias,
the
cable
systems
would
carry
every
broadcast
station
regardless
of
how
minimal
the
viewership,
in
preference
to
the
150
or
so
other
programmers
that
are
also
seeking
access.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
there
are
two
different
questions
that
are
involved.
first
of
all,
there
can
be
a
burden
on
rights
that
is
substantial,
even
though
as
a
mathematical
matter
the
burden
on
speech
itself
is
not
particularly
substantial,
but
i
don't
even
think
that
is
the
case
here.
i
mean,
there
are
across
the
country
not
only
stations
that
in
the
past
have
been
dropped
and
were
restored
by
must-carry,
but
many
stations
that
are
locked
in,
and
as
the
record
shows
now
in
the
case,
two
out
of
every
three
subscribers
is
served
by
a
system
that
is
channel-blocked,
that
is,
it
has
no
available
channels
at
all
for
programming,
and
the
other
third
of
subscribers
are
served
by
systems
that
will
be
channel-blocked
at
some
point.
the
government's
expert
concedes
that
no
cable
system
actually
builds
in
excess
capacity
for
permanent
use.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
the
term
large
number
of
broadcasters
means.
what
the
record
shows,
and
i
think
this
is
consistent
with
essentially
the
government's
interpretation
of
it
as
well,
is
that
the
cable
operators
in
the
past,
without
must-carry,
voluntarily
carried
virtually
all
network
affiliates,
they
carried
virtually
all
vhf
independent
stations,
they
carried
a
considerable
majority
of
uhf
stations,
about
80
percent
of
educational
stations,
and
even
one
out
of
three
of
every
station
that
did
not
command
even
a
measurable
viewership.
now,
if
one
looks
at
that
pattern,
what
that
shows...
and
then
groups
that
with
stations
community
by
community.
what
that
effectively
shows
is
that
in
communities
with
relatively
small
numbers
of
stations,
four,
five,
six,
which
tends
to
be
more
the
norm,
the
cable
system
tends
to
carry...
not
always,
but
tends
to
carry
all
of
the
stations,
or
most
of
the
stations.
then
as
you
get
into
markets
where
there
are
more
and
more
stations,
10,
12,
14,
those
tend
to
be
the
stations
that
cable
systems
do
not
regularly
carry.
the
question
then
depends
on
whether
those
stations,
even
though
they
have
very
low
viewership,
tend
to
add
something
to
the
overall
package
that
a
cable
operator
is
trying
to
provide
to
its
subscribers,
and
many
of
those
stations
do.
that's
why
they're
carried.
but
the
fact
is,
cable
operators
will
not
carry
all
of
the
very
lightly
viewed
stations
if
they
believe
there
is
other
programming
that
will
provide
a
better
fit
in
the
package
that
it's
offering
to
subscribers.
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
to
put
an
exact
number
on
that,
but
we
know
from
the
history
that
the
number
was
not...
in
terms
of
must-carry
ads
was
only
6,000
in
the
past,
and
i
assume
some
of
those
would
still
be
carried,
and
then
of
the
30,000,
some
number
of
those
would
not
be
carried
even
though
they
were
before.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
first
of
all
it
very
much
would
depend
on
what
the
programming
of
the
new
stations
would
be.
during
the
period
without
must-carry,
justice
souter,
as
the
court
i
think
is
aware
from
the
record,
there
was
a
great
increase
in
the
overall
number
of
broadcast
stations,
both
commercial
and
noncommercial.
during
the
period
from
'85
to
'92,
there
were
270
new
stations,
and
from
the
period
of
1980
to
1992,
every
market
of
the
209
adi's
in
the
country
had
either
the
same
number
of
stations
or
a
greater
number,
and
most
had
a
greater
number.
so
when
there
are
proliferations
of
stations
like
that,
the
question
of
whether
their
programming
is
going
to
be
of
interest
to
the
particular
community,
or
the
particular
subscribers
to
a
cable
system,
i
think
will
depend
very
much
on
what
kind
of
programming
it
is.
as
your
question
indicates,
obviously
cable
programmers
do
carry
a
substantial
number
of
even
those
brand
new
stations,
obviously
because
they
find
something
in
the
programming
that
they
feel
will
appeal
generally
to
their
subscribers,
but
i
think
there
can't
be
any
absolute
question
as
to
whether
each
one
will
be
carried
or
each
one
will
not
be
carried.
i
think
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the
numbers
on
stations
that
do
not
survive
suggest
that
the
number
is
very
low.
i
don't
know
that
the
number
is
broken
out
by
whether
they
were
brand
new
stations
or
whether
they
were
stations
that
had
previously
existed.
of
course,
the
bringing
on,
even
if
you
had
no
cable
whatsoever,
the
fact
that
you
are
increasing
the
number
of
stations
within
particular
television
markets
will
put
pressure
on
the
other
broadcasting
stations.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
right.
so
i
mean,
that's
simply
a
factor
of
numbers
in
competition,
even
without
respect
to
cable.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
unfortunately,
it
has
not
become
less
and
less
of
a
problem
to
date.
i
think
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
the
cable
industry
at
the
moment
knows
that
channel
space
is
greatly
at
a
premium
within
the
industry
as
a
whole.
one
of
the
reasons
for
that,
of
course,
is
that
there
are
many
new
cable
programmers
as
well
as
additional
broadcast
stations
that
are
seeking
access
to
these
cable
systems.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
general
the
capacity
of
cable
systems
is
expanding,
but
it
is
not
expanding
at
a
pace
that
is
outstripping
the
expansion
of
programmers
who
are
trying
to
reach
the
audiences
that
cable
operators
serve.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
using
it
i
think
as
it's
been
in
use
throughout
this
case
to
mean
the
first
of
those
two.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
essentially
a
network
of
some
sort.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
don't
think
they're
specifically
plaintiffs
in
this
particular
case.
obviously,
to
the
extent,
for
example,
that
those...
there's
a
market
for
those
programs,
particularly
for
whatever
reason
within
cable
programmers,
to
the
extent
those
cable
programmers
can't
get
onto
the
stations
because
the
broadcasters
are
required
to
be
carried,
it
may...
it
would
have
a
derivative
effect
on
them,
but
that's
not
the
specific
claim
that's
at
issue
here.
the
claim
here
is
that
the
programming
network
itself,
which
wants
to
be
carried
within
an
area--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
those
are
essentially--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--if
you're
talking
about
affiliated
with
cable
operators--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
don't
have
a
particular
number.
i
can
perhaps
work
backwards
a
little
bit
from
the
other
side.
if
you
look
at
the
cable
operators
themselves,
tci,
which
is
the
largest
cable
operator,
has
an
interest
in
something
like
20
cable
programmers.
time
warner,
after
its
merger
with
turner,
is
somewhere
around
a
dozen.
the
others
are
all...
there
may
be
four
or
five
that
have
interests
in
about
four
or
five
programmers,
and
the
rest
the
cable
operators
typically
have
no
interest.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
to
begin
with
i
don't
think
it
is
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
having
to
add
a
channel
as
a
result
of
must-carry
doesn't
reflect
the
limitation
on
cable
operators
who
may
at
the
time
have
been
carrying
a
broadcast
station
but
now
in
a
different
world
of
programming
might
choose
not
to
carry
that
particular
station.
as
i
said--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--in
terms--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
particular
way
to
measure
it,
because
obviously
must-carry
has
been
in
place
since
1992,
or
since
it
was
implemented,
so
there
isn't
a
way
to
test
particularly
what
cable
operators
will
do
given
the
program
selections
right
now.
i
would
point
out,
though,
that
i...
the
government,
it
seems
to
me,
in
its
argument
tries
to
essentially...
excuse
me...
make
a
balancing
argument
here
saying,
well,
this
will
help
broadcast
stations
to
have
carriage,
and
we
think
that
the
impact
on
cable
operators
and
cable
programmers
won't
really
be
all
that
significant,
and
therefore
i
think
their
argument
is
that
we
really
needn't
be
concerned
about
what
impact
there
is.
i
do
think,
i
should
say,
i
think
that's
a
false
equation.
i
don't
think
that
the
first
amendment
is
essentially
a
quantitative
balancing
test
in
which
the
government
can
say,
we
will
try
to
benefit
these
speakers
at
the
expense
of
these
other
speakers
as
long
as
we
balance
out
the
harms
in
a
way
that
we
think
is
in
the
public
interest.
i
think
the
first
amendment
is
a
qualitative
standard
that
in
fact
puts
a
barrier
to
what
government
can
do
unless
it
is
pursuing
substantial
interests,
and
it
has
properly
tailored
what
the
law
is
to
those
interests.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
implicit
in
this
sense,
i
think,
justice
souter,
if
i
understand
the
question.
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
i
indicated
that
i...
the
reasons
that
i
thought
that
the
anticompetitive
rationale
for
this
law
would
not
stand
up,
that
the
law
is
simply
way
to
broad
for
any
demonstrated
anticompetitive
behavior,
and
in
addition,
although
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
say
it,
there
is
the
tailoring
problem
specifically
addressed
by
judge
williams,
that
the
law
in
fact
imposes
discrimination.
it
just
doesn't
relieve
the
burdens
of
any
bias
that
the
government
presumes
to
be
there.
so
i
think
if
one
takes
that
interest
out,
as
i
think
properly
the
court
should,
then
the
question
is,
can
the
government
use
the
means
of
forcing
access
onto
the
private
media
in
order
to
serve
their
goal
of
promoting
broadcasting
for
over-the-air
viewers?
i
think
that's
a
straight,
fundamental
question
about
the
power
of
government,
and
i
don't
think
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
primarily
on
some
balancing
between--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
amount
of
benefit
to
the
broadcasters
and
harm
to
the
programmers.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
certainly
has
to
be
a
weighing,
if
that
is
a
proper
term,
of
the
governmental
interest,
but
i
don't
think
that
can
be
divorced
from
the
question
of
the
means
by
which
the
government
is
pursuing
it.
certainly,
the
government
can
pursue
the
interest
of
benefiting
individual
broadcast
stations,
for
example,
by
granting
them
subsidies,
or
by
providing
other
forms
of
benefit
to
encourage
their
development.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
not
saying
that
they
can't
promote
it
in
general.
in
fact,
i
agree
that
they
can
promote
it
in
general.
what
i'm
saying
is,
though,
that
when
they
come
to
the
question
of
means,
how
they
are
doing
it,
when
they
say
the
means
by
which
we
are
going
to
promote
it
are
to
limit
the
speech
rights
of
others,
then
they're
running
up
against
a
barrier
that
the
first
amendment
imposes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
obviously,
that
would
be
a
less
restrictive
alternative,
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
think
in
fairness
i
should
make
two
points,
though.
first
of
all,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
wouldn't
have
any
impact,
because
the
relationship
between
cable
operators
and
their
subscribers
is
essentially
the
coin
of
the
realm
for
cable
operators,
and
for
them
to
put
programming
on
and
take
it
off
does
introduce
some
irritation.
the
second
point
is
that
i'm
not
sure
it
really
serves
the
government
interest
to
have
a
broadcast
station
on
for
a
month
or
two
and
then
take
it
off,
but
if
the
government
felt
that
that...
and
could
demonstrate
that
that
did
substantially
advance
its
interest,
that
would
be
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it's
less
restrictive
because
it
only
has
one
of
the
two
constitutional
flaws
of
the
must-carry
statute,
because
in
that
particular
case
it
is
not
excluding
a
programmer
at
that
moment
that
the
operator
has
decided
it
would
otherwise
carry.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
must-carry
law
has
both
of
those
effects,
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
believe
that
they
are
equally
bad,
justice
stevens.
the
fact
is
that...
for
the
same
reason
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
that
i
do
think
the
first
amendment
puts
a
limitation
on
the
means
government
can
use
to
advance
speech.
i
don't
think
that
particularly
changes
with
the
content
of
the
speech
and,
indeed,
if
the
court
were
to
rely
on
the
content
of
the
speech
to
make
that
determination,
i
think
it
would
call
into
some
question
the
use
of
the
intermediate
standard.
i
should
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
interest
in
preventing
anticompetitive
behavior,
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
public
tv
stations
really
is
an
even
weaker
argument
than
it
is
with
respect
to
the
commercial
tv
stations.
they
are
obviously
not
competitors
in
the
advertising
market
along
with
the
cable
systems,
and
therefore
at
least
one
of
the
linchpins--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
don't
think,
though,
typically,
that
someone
who
is
choosing
to
donate
to
a
public
television
station
is
choosing
between
that
and
running
a
local
ad
on
the
cable
system.
there
may
be
some
instances
of
that,
but
i
think
generally
the
advertising
market
that
one
is
talking
about
is
the
actual
commercial
advertising
market.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
oh,
i
think
that
is
true.
i'm
not
saying...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that
would
not,
i
don't
think,
be
a
reason
that
a
cable
system
would
not
run
a
public
broadcast
station,
in
the
hopes
that
it
would
draw
off
what
would
otherwise
be
donated
to
the
broadcast
station
and
to
add
it
to
its
own
advertising
revenues.
whether
it
had
an
effect
on
the
public
tv
station
is
a
separate
question.
i
would
like
to
return
to
a
point
that
came
up
a
few
minutes
ago,
though,
about
the
ownership
relationship
between
owners
and
programmers.
as
i
said,
it
is
limited
to
a
certain
number
of
operators,
and
even
those,
most
of
them
have
a
relatively
small
number
of
interests
in
programmers,
but
i
should
say
something
which
i
think
has
not
really
received
enough
attention
in
this
case
in
the
lower
courts
as
well,
that
i
think
vertical
integration
is
essentially
a
red
herring
here,
and
i
think
that
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
i
think
judge
williams
is
perfectly
correct
that
if
you
look
at
vertical
integration
the
statute
is
not
at
all
tailored
to
it.
it
applies
to
operators
who
aren't
vertically
integrated.
it
applies
to
decisions
between
nonintegrated
programmers
and
broadcast
stations.
but
more
importantly
than
that,
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
communications
act
that
deals
with
vertical
integration.
in
fact,
there
are
several
of
them,
and
the...
one
of
the
provisions
authorizes
the
commission
to
set
limits
on
the
number
of
integrated
programmers
that
an
operator
can
carry,
which
has
been
set
basically
at
40
percent,
but
another
one
of
them
has
a
specific
nondiscrimination
provision
barring
cable
operators
from
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
affiliation,
so
the
idea
that
the
must-carry
law
itself,
that
part
of
the
act
was
intended
to
remedy
a
problem
of
vertical
integration
it
seems
to
me
is
belied
by
the
other
purposes...
excuse
me,
by
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
itself.
now,
i'd
just
like
to
make
one
point
about
the
anticompetitive
argument,
because
i
think
it's
critical
in
thinking
about
what
the
government
calls
structural
regulation,
but
keep
in
mind
two
things
about
structural
regulation.
first
of
all,
just
calling
something
structural
regulation
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
indicate
much
about
where...
how
it
should
be
analyzed
under
the
first
amendment.
first
of
all,
the
question
is
what
does
it
regulate,
and
what
the
structural
regulation
here
is
regulating
is
who
can
speak
on
a
cable
system.
the
second
thing
is
that
structural
regulation
is
by
its
nature
prophylactic,
and
prophylactic
regulation
is,
as
this
court
has
often
said,
disfavored
under
the
first
amendment.
so
i
would
submit
that
just
because
the
government
characterizes
something
as
economic
regulation
or
structural
regulation,
even
under
o'brien,
the
court
has
to
look
carefully
at
the
assumptions
that
the
government
makes
to
justify
a
broad
prophylactic
law
and,
furthermore,
has
to
look
at
the
remedy
that's
imposed
to
see
if
the
remedy
is
consistent
with
the
types
of
remedies
that
are
imposed
in
other
industries
not
involving
speech,
because
if
it's
not,
if
the
remedy
that
is
used,
as
it
is
here,
is
broader
than
what
would
be
used
in
another
comparable
situation,
then
the
government
it
seems
to
me
has
a
strong
burden
of
answering
why
the
other
remedy
is
not
a
suitable,
less
restrictive--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--not
that
i
know
of.
it...
i
believe
it's
just
a...
something
which
is
being
used
to
describe
in
a
loose
fashion
regulation
that
does
aim
at
a
particular
industry
but
is
not
specifically
aimed
at
the
content
of
speech.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
difficulties,
i
think,
in
addressing
the
government's
interest
here
is
that
it
is
still
difficult
to
pin
down.
the
specific
finding
by
congress
made
in
the
act
is
that
as
a
result
of
the
economic
incentive
that
cable
systems
have
to
delete
its
set
of
local
broadcast
systems,
coupled
with
the
absence
of
must-carry,
the
economic
viability
of
free
local
broadcast
television
and
its
ability
to
originate
quality
local
programming
will
be
seriously
jeopardized.
that
is
the
finding
by
congress
itself,
not
arguments
made
by
the
executive
branch.
then,
however,
it
seems
that
the
argument
had
turned
at
some
point
to
survival
of
broadcasters,
that
in
fact
the
existence
of
cable
itself
would
harm
individual
broadcasters,
which
in
our
view
at
least
is
itself
a
less
significant
interest
than
some
broad...
broader
interest
indicating
that
a
multiplicity
of
voices
in
a
significant
number
of
communities
would
be
lost.
in
fact,
this
court
has
recognized,
and
congress
has
said
before,
that
it
is
typically
not
concerned
with
the
fate
of
individual
broadcast
stations,
but
rather
with
the
system
as
a
whole.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes.
i
would
say
so
for
several
reasons.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm...
well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
again,
it
depends
what
the
justifications
are.
what
we
have
said--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--if
that
is
the
sole
justification
that
is
offered,
and
the
means
by
which
that
is
being
obtained
is
to
say
to
cable
operators
that
you
have
to
carry
this
program--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
it's
very
hard
to
answer
the
question,
to
be
honest,
justice
stevens,
without
thinking
about
means.
if
you're
saying,
can
government
subsidize
that,
of
course
it
can.
of
course
it
can.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
government
provides
funding
for
all
sorts
of
things
where
content
is
an
issue.
it
funds
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
in
my
view
the
law
should
go
down
whether
it's
content-based
or
not,
of
course.
that's
the
position
that
we
are
fully
prepared
to
argue,
but--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--of
course.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
of
course.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
because
the
government
can
say,
we
are
going
to
subsidize
something
with
a
particular
content,
and
if
it
does...
if
those
are
the
means
by
which
it's
choosing
to
do
it,
that
is
one
thing.
when
it
says,
we
are
going
to
subsidize
essentially
by
means
of
using
you,
by
using
your
channels
and
shutting
out
other
programmers,
that's
our
way
of
subsidizing
it,
that
falls
on
the
other
side
of
the
first
amendment
line,
and
that
seems
to
me,
when
you're
talking
about
the
quality
of
programming,
that
is
where
the
interest
has
now
shifted.
survival
is
not
particularly
an
issue.
i
mean,
a
very
small
number
of
stations,
as
the
court
has
noted,
even
went
dark,
and
many
of
them
returned
to
the
air.
i
mean,
these
figures,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
briefs,
include
a
station
that
was...
whose
transmitter
was
hit
by
a
tornado,
so
what
we're
talking
about,
when
we...
but
when
you
move
from
there
on
to
talk
about
the
question
of
the
programming
being
maintained
or
enhanced
at
a
certain
level,
that
seems
to
me
to
open
up
a
whole
area
of
first
amendment
objections
that
this
court
has
really
never
entered
into
before,
i
mean,
that's
in
a
sense
the
pruneyard
case
unleashed,
that
says,
when
we
want
to
encourage
diversity,
and
we
want
to
stimulate
more
of
a
particular
kind
of
voice,
of
particular
speakers,
whether
it's
done
by
viewpoint
or
not,
we
can
essentially
take
a
business
of
speech,
a
private
business,
and
use
that
as
the
means
of
doing
it.
that
is
a
line
that
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
ever
crossed,
and
i
don't
think
should
cross
now.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
if
you're
talking...
i'm
sorry,
if...
i--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--when
i
said
it
crossed
a
first
amendment
line
that
had
not
been
crossed,
it
has
been
crossed
partially
in
the
broadcasting
context,
and
the
court
has
looked
at
one
or
two
specific
examples
of
it,
for
example
in
red
lion,
and
said
it
was
tolerable.
in
league
of
women
voters,
it
said
that
was
beyond
the
commission's
power
to
interfere
in
content,
so
i'm
not
sure
where
the
precise
answer
would
be.
