chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-992,
the
turner
broadcasting
system
v.
the
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
farr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
farr,
you
say
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
require...
it
doesn't
usually
import
any
balancing,
but
when
you're
talking
about,
is
there
a
substantial
government
interest
here
under
the
o'brien
test,
that
itself
is
a
form
of
balancing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
it
can't,
then,
simply
promote
broadcast
television
in
general
because
it's
free
to
the
listener?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
get
some
donations,
don't
they?
i
mean,
you
see,
you
know,
this
is
sponsored
by
mobil
in
connection
with
public
television.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
term
structural
borrowed
from
some
body
of
the
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
farr.
general
dellinger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
on
the
basis
of
the...
assuming
that
congress
made
the
appropriate
finding,
i
think
the
prevailing
opinion
last
time
said
something
more
was
required
to
show
the
rationality
of
congress'
choice.
now,
what
is
shown
in
the
subsequent
proceedings
after
the
opinion
3
years
ago?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
eight
thousand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
out
of
how
large
a
universe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you
say,
mr.
dellinger,
you
want
quality
programming,
and
yet
you
also
say
that
the
60
percent
of
the
people
who
don't
have
cable,
or
40
percent,
whatever,
are
perhaps
people
in
lower
income
brackets
and
that
sort
of
thing.
maybe
the
people
in
the
lower
income
brackets
don't
necessarily
want
the
history
channel
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
dellinger.
mr.
ennis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
refute
what
seems
to
be
the
message
of
the...
there
were
only
31
stations,
that
none
of
that
had
much
effect
on
the
great,
great
majority
of
broadcast
stations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
answer
the
fact
that
only
31
broadcasting
stations
actually
departed
this
world,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
the
first
opinion
in
this
case
we
said
that
because
there's
intermediate
scrutiny
we
didn't
accept
as
final
congress'
judgment
on
that
score.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
respond
to
the
apparently
conceded
fact
that
only
31
stations
out
of
the
great,
great
number
actually
went
under?
what's
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
farr,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
the
case
is
submitted.
