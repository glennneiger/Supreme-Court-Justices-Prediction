justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you
think
we
ought
to
assess
the
significance
of
the
fact...
i
take
it's
a
fact...
that
the
brunt
of
the
decisions
not
to
carry
tends
to
fall
on
the
new
stations?
i
think
the
figures
were
that
in
the
absence
of
must-carry
about
50
percent
of
the
new
public
broadcasting
channels
did
not
get
carried,
and
something
i
think
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
third
of
the
new
nonpublic
channels
did
not
get
carried,
so
the
brunt
of
the
decisions
not
to
carry
by
the
cable
operators
tends
to
fall
on
the
new
stations.
how
do
we
assess
the
significance
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
know
how
many
of
those...
in
the
period
before
the
present
must-carry
rules,
do
we
know
how
many
of
those
50
percent
and
33-1/3
percent,
or
whatever
it
was,
failed
to
survive
when
they
were
not
picked
up
by
the
cable
channels?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
we'd
have
to
know
the
differential
to
make
a...
yeah,
to
make
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
farr,
may
i
go
back
to
the
subject
of
justice
ginsburg's
question?
my
recollection
is
that
the
figure
in
the
record
was
that
when
must-carry
came
in,
about,
i
think
it
was
6
percent
of
cable
operators
had
to
drop
at
least
one
program
in
order
to
comply
with
must-carry.
the
suggestion
was
that
that
figure
perhaps
is
not
wholly
representative
of
the
significance
of
must-carry
because
there
was
evidence
that
the
cable
operators
were
sort
of
on
their
good
behavior
before
that,
but
in
any
case
we
got
a
figure
of
about
6
percent.
is
that
figure
still,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
the
best
measure
that
we
have
of
the,
at
least
the
quantified
significance
of
must-carry
on
the
operators?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
true,
but
do
we
have
anything
but
a
speculative
basis
to
assess
that
latter
significance?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
we'll
assume
it
exists,
but
i
don't
know
how
we...
i
don't
know
that
we
have
any
measurement
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
why
do...
your
implication
is
that
there
is
not
a
substantial
interest
here
because
the
beneficial
impact
under
the
three
headings
that
turner
i
spoke
of
is
insufficiently
significant.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
what's
implicit
in
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
common
sense
viewpoint
that
the
quality
will
be
better,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you
start
talking
about
quality,
you're
walking
your
way
in,
aren't
you,
into
a
content-based
justification?
you're
saying,
we
will
compare
the
programming,
and
it
will
be
better
programming,
i
presume,
by
some
governmental
judgment.
you're
turning
this
into
a
content-based
justification,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't
make
them
on
a
specific
case-by-case
basis,
but
i
think
the
tendency
of
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
is,
when
you
talk
about
vibrancy
and
quality,
you
are
talking
about
some
kind
of
a
content-based
standard,
and
i
think
what
you're...
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
overall,
not
on
a
program-by-program
basis,
but
overall,
the
content
is
going
to
be
better.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
quality
program,
yes--
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
mr.
ennis,
there's
no
question...
i
guess
there's
no
question
in
anybody's
mind
about
there
being
a
significant
repositioning
as
a
result
of
must-carry,
but
isn't
the
ultimate
measure
of
the
value
of
that
repositioning,
or
its
absence,
the
31-station
measure?
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
the
evidence,
out
of
over
40,00
broadcast
stations
and,
indeed,
out
of
8,000
that
were
directly
affected
by
must-carry,
only
31
went
under
as
a
result
of
the
repositioning
in
the
absence
of
must-carry.
isn't
that
the
relevant
figure
that
we
ought
to
look
at
to
determine
the
substantiality
of
the
interest
and
of
the
threat?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
was
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--are
we
now,
then,
back
into
content?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
justification,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
or
your
argument
on
behalf
of
congress,
the
justification
for
that
is
that
in
fact
there
will
be
a
higher
quality
of
programming
if
there
is
this
greater
choice
as
a
result
of
greater
advertising
revenue,
and
so
on,
and
doesn't
that,
then,
bring
us
to
a
content-based
congressional
choice?
