mr.
farr,
when
you
use
the
term,
programmer...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand...
are
you
referring
to
a
company
that
presents
a
full
line,
7
days
a
week,
24
hours
a
day,
or
however
much
they're
on
the
air,
or
do
you
also
include
within
that
term
companies
that
might
produce
individual
programs
they
try
to
sell,
like
the
civil
war
documentary
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
the
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
not
here
concerned
with
the
impact
on
people
who
try
to
sell
individual
programs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
the...
that's
what
you're
referring
to
on
that
150
figure
you
used,
is
that
full-line
programmers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
many
of
those
are
affiliated
and
how
many
are
unaffiliated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
that
section
4
and
section
5
are
equally
bad,
or
equally
good,
whichever
way
we
go?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr,
can
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
basic
question
that
the
colloquy
has
developed?
assume
that
the
government's
objective
was
to
get
better
program
through
diversity,
quality,
public,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
but
not
to
support
any
particular
viewpoint,
but
it
is
therefore
fairly
characterized
as
a
content-based
justification...
that's...
would
you
say
that
was
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
therefore
section
5
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
suppose
a
comparable
provision
of
the
1934
act
is
unconstitutional,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
justification
is,
diversity
and
better
programming.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
forget
the
means.
i'm
just
asking
you,
assume
the
means,
and
well-tailored
and
all
the
rest,
but
that's
the
sole
justification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it's
content-based,
the
justification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
can
we
say
that
this
colloquy
about
whether
the
justification
is
content-based
or
not
really
shouldn't
affect
our
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
it
be
content-based
and
not
affect
first
amendment
rights?
