mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
many
of
the
discussions
that
you've
had
so
far
this
morning
with
mr.
farr
related
to
his
discussion
of
what
the
government
interest
may
be,
and
efforts
that
they've
made
in
oral
argument
earlier
and
in
their
brief
to
cabinet
and
denigrate
that
interest.
i
want
to
be
clear
that
the
government
interest
in
this
case
is
important,
substantial,
content-neutral,
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
free
expression,
and
solidly
grounded
in
reasonable
inferences
that
are
based
upon
substantial
evidence.
in
spite
of
the
talk
about
the
anticompetitive
market
foreclosure
effects,
there
is,
as
justice
kennedy's
opinion
recognized
in
turner
i,
a
very
clear
principal
goal
of
the
must-carry
law,
and
that
is
to
preserve
a
healthy
multiplicity
of
broadcast
sources
for
the
40
percent
of
american
homes
that
do
not
have
cable,
homes
that
rely
upon
free,
over-the-air
broadcasting
as
the
entire
source
of
their
television
programming.
when
cable
systems
deny
carriage
to
local
broadcast
stations,
and
thereby
foreclose
those
stations
from
reaching
the
60-percent
of
households,
often
more
affluent,
that
rely
upon
cable,
those
local
broadcast
stations
lose
revenue
and
suffer
financially.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
scalia,
i
think
to
the
extent
it
is
conceded
that
"a
few
voices
would
be
lost.
"
it
is
conceded
that
the
government
should
prevail
in
this
case,
that
it's
a
perfectly
consti--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
believe--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--they
spend
a
considerable
amount
of
time
in
their
brief
suggesting
that
the
government
needed
to
prove
that
the
entire
national
broadcast
industry,
or
the
local
broadcasting
industry
would
collapse
in
the
absence
of
must-carry,
but
i
want
to
explain
why
i
think
the
loss
of
some
over-the-air
broadcast
stations
is
a
matter
of
critical
importance
to
the
government.
i
think
the
record
on
remand
amply
shows
that
exclusion
from
cable
will
harm
local
broadcasters
so
excluded,
and
they
will
be
unable
to
provide
the
kind
of
sort
of
robust
array
of
quality
programming
that
they
could
if
they
had
the
revenues
from
cable
access.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
congress
had
an
ample
basis
for--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
what
is
shown
by
the
evidence
on
remand,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
problem
is
even
worse
than
congress
initially
supposed.
we...
there
was
much
debate
about
whether,
as
a
predictive
matter
from
economic
theory,
stations
would
be
dropped
in
the
absence
of
must-carry,
broadcast
stations
would
be
dropped.
in
fact,
we
now
know
that
it
happened.
it
happened
nearly
8,000
times.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
eight
thousand
times,
broadcast
stations
were
dropped
from
one
or
more
cable
systems.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
how
large
a
universe?
there
are
about
1,500
broadcast
stations
in
this
country.
there
are
12,000
cable
systems.
there
are...
those
12,000
cable
systems
have
about
500,000
total
channels
available.
the
dropping
of
7,945
stations
for
more
than
a
year,
between
'85
and
'92
as
the...
page
621
of
the
joint
appendix
will
show
was...
showed
that
in
the
years
before
must-carry
the
typical
cable
system
denied
carriage
to
somewhere
between
one-quarter
and
one-third
of
the
broadcast
stations.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there
would
be
during
that
period
broadcast
stations
added.
i
don't
have
the
exact
figure,
justice
ginsburg.
it
would
have
been
far
fewer
than
the
number
that
were
dropped.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
the
total
number
of
broadcast
stations
that
were
carried
were
35,000
nationwide,
so
there's
a
lot.
but
let
me
address
the
question
you've
raised
twice
now...
let
me
come
back
to
it...
of
whether
the
dropping
of
a
few
stations
is
something
about
which
congress
can
legitimately
be
concerned,
that
would
support
must-carry.
i
think
that's
a
critical
part
of
mr.
farr's
argument
as
well.
if
you
take
a
community
that
has
six
or
seven
stations,
and
seven
local
over-the-air
broadcast
stations
is
about
the
national
average,
if
you
take
a
community
and
between
one-quarter
and
one-third
of
those
stations
are
denied
carriage
on
cable,
you're
weakening,
substantially
weakening
two
out
of
six,
two
out
of
six
local
broadcast
stations.
perhaps
it's
three
out
of
nine
in
other
communities.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
it
is
clear
that
congress
has,
i
think,
since
the
radio
act
in
1927
and
the
communications
act,
treated
communications
differently.
they
could
not
do
that
with
newspapers,
but
then
newspapers
do
not
have
the
critical
throat-hold
that
cable
operators
have
over
access
to
those--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
what
cable
operators
have
is
a
gate-keeping
function
over
the
wire
that
goes
into
the
homes
of
60
percent
of
those
in
the
community.
if
you
don't
get
a...
there
is
no
one
that
has
the
authority...
no
newspaper
has
the
authority
to
exclude
others
from
reaching
the
potential
audience
in
the
way
that
the
cable
system
does.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
answer
to
that
question
i
think
is
that...
is
that
local
over-the-air
broadcasting
is
probably
the...
now
the
cheapest
and
most
accessible
form
of
sources
of
information
in
this
country.
i...
you
can
buy...
some
years
back
i
bought
a
black
and
white
television
set
from
a
repair
shop
for
$15.
it
lasted
for
more
than
a
decade.
even
if
the
price
is
$50
or
$100
for
the
bottom
line
television
set
at
a
discount
house,
the
longevity
of
those
sets
means
that
you're
talking
a
few
dollars
a
year.
for
a
few
dollars
a
year,
those
who
don't
have
cable...
it's
90
million
americans...
can
rely
upon
that
simple
fact.
the
whole
community
benefits
from
having
a
source
of
information,
and
one
wants
to
have
on
that
source
of
information
as
many
stations
as
the
economy
of
the
local
community
and
its
market
area
will
support,
what
this
court
has
called
a
broad
array
of
diverse
and
antagonistic
sources
of
information,
is
quite
good.
when
you
drop
a
station,
one
or
two
stations,
you
may
be
dropping
the
station
that
is
most
critical
to
a
language
minority,
it
may
be
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
breyer,
i
think
that
there
is
ample
evidence
that
even
in
the
absence
of
loss
of
survival...
i
mean,
justice
souter
asked
the
same
question.
survival
is
not
the
only
issue.
there
is...
both...
our
common
sense
tells
us
that
when
you
lose
revenues,
you
lose
the
ability
to
put
on
quality
programming.
to
have
the
same
number
of
stations
and
have
them
show
the
test
pattern,
or,
to
use
a
more
realistic
example,
to
have
the
same
number
of
stations
but
have
them
sufficiently
depleted
of
resources
by
not
being
on
cable,
if
you
put
some
fellow
up
there
with
costume
jewelry
and
a
telephone
to
take
home
shopping
inquiries
is
not
going
to
be...
is
not
going
to
provide
that
source
of...
if
you
look
at--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
is
very
important
that
the
prosperity
of
programmers
is
only
an
intermediate
step,
not
the
final
goal,
as
mr.
farr
has
suggested
or
as
your
question
would
posit.
it
is
only
an
intermediate
step
towards
the
actual
goal
of
assuming
that
there
is
some
vibrancy
and
health
to
those
small,
local
broadcast--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
i
mean,
you
save
me
the
effort
of
going
through
the
25
hundred
volumes
it
cited.
i
mean,
we
did
have
david
schutz,
roger
knowles,
other
experts--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--he
said--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
he
said
it's
an
important
factor
in
determining
the
quality
of
a
station's
programs.
now,
there
certainly
is,
let
me
say
admittedly,
anecdotal
evidence,
but
anecdotal
evidence
that
supports
our
common
sense
viewpoint.
for
example--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
yes.
that's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--one
of
the
virtues
of
the
must-carry
system
as
compared
to
what
the
cable
industry
suggests
as
an
alternative,
that
is,
of
government
subsidies,
is
the
government
doesn't
have
to
make
those
content-based
decisions.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
say
that
providing
this
kind...
that
these
over-the-air
broadcast
channels
are
not
starved
financially
in
the
hopes
that
they're
available
to
the
community
for
the
quality
programming
that
is
chosen
by--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--those
local
programmers
and
not
by
the
government.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
it's...
these
are
stations
that
often
appeal
to
communities.
take
an
example.
kcec
was
a
spanish
language
station,
over-the-air
broadcast
station.
once
it
got
on
the
cable,
it
had
the
resources
to
institute
its
first
local
news
program
in
the
spanish
language
that
served
the
hispanic
population.
a
lot
of
these...
there's
a
new
fourth
network
made
up
of
channels
that
used
to
be
located
in
the
nether
regions
of
broadcasting.
getting
them
on
cable
leads
to
more
sources.
i
do
not
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--let
me
respond
to
your
first
question
first,
which
is
that
i
do
think
it's
important
that
having
a
legitimate
congressional
concern
that
local
broadcasters
are
not
depleted
of
revenue
so
that
those
local
broadcasters
can
make
their
own
decisions
and
have
the
resources--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
both
the
subsidy
and
the
a/b
switch
are
unsatisfactory
and
not
less
restrictive
alternatives,
but
it
is
important
to
me
that
we
understand
that
one
is
not
touching
a
third
rail
of
content
skewing
by
the
government
for
the
government
to
think
that
local
broadcasters
ought
not
be
starved
of
resources
so
they
can
choose,
but
on
these
two
alternatives,
the
problem
of
government
subsidies--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
government--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
congress
believes
that
there
are...
that
the
harm
suffered
to
local
broadcasters
when
they're
not
carried
by
local
systems
includes
reduction
in
a
whole
range
of
services,
of
content,
that
they
could
offer.
that's...
government
is
not
choosing
content,
but
wants
there
to
be
some
robustness
in
local
program,
or
the
ability
of
them
to
choose
that.
now,
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
during
the
period
in
the
mid-eighties
to
1992,
it
was
of
course
a
period
of
great
economic
growth,
so
statistics
generally
are
good,
but
in
the
joint
record
before
congress
there
are
many
instances
of
public
stations
where
the...
particularly
the
secondary...
second
or
third
public
broadcast
stations,
ones
that
might
be
serving
a
community
college,
is
being
repositioned,
losing
its
channel
place
in
the
middle
of
a
community
college
course,
and
there's
also
the
additional
interest
that
congress
has
always
had
in
promoting
educational
television
and
making
sure
the
cable
homes
have
access
to
educational
programs.
i
mean,
it's
important
as
we
debate
these
issues
to
remember
that
the
question
is
not
whether
on
these
factual
disputes
mr.
farr
is
right
or
i'm
right,
or
even
whether
congress
was
right.
the
question
you
put
in
turner
i
was
whether
the
obligation
to
exercise
independent
judgment
when
first
amendment
rights
were
implicated,
you
said,
there
is
not
a
license
to
reweigh
the
evidence
de
novo.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
evidence
was
more
than
substantial,
and
the
averments
were
more
than
reasonable
that
the
loss
of
8,000
local
broadcast
stations
being
kept
off
of
cable
systems
during
that
period,
coupled
with,
just
in
the
printed
appendix,
2,511
pages
of
substantial
evidence
to
support
congress'
judgment
that
they
were
going
to
suffer
financially,
have
less
resources
to
provide
programming,
and
those
90
million
homes
that
depend
upon
local
broadcast
television
would
have
a
less
diverse,
broad,
and
healthy
source
of
broadcast
information.
