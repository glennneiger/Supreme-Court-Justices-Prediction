justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
some
point
during
the
argument...
maybe
now
if
it's
convenient...
would
you
just
explain
this
to
me,
mr.
farr.
i've
always
had
this
difficulty
with
the
case.
the
cable
operators
say,
this
is
so
terribly
burdensome.
we
have
to
cancel
out
programmers
whom
we'd
rather
have.
and
then
on
the
other
hand
it
says
in
its
brief,
well,
we're
not
really
cancelling
the
broadcasters.
all
this
is
unnecessary.
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
we
conclude
from
your
argument
that
if
you
prevail
on
this
case
a
large
number
of
broadcasters
will
be
dropped?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
they...
but
they
do
choose
to
make
the
endorsement
or
not
based
on
a
projection
of
the
size
of
the
audience,
surely?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
we
indicated,
general
dellinger,
that
we
wanted
evidence
that
there
was
a
significant...
a
significant
effect,
beneficial
effect
that
must-carry
had,
and
you
at
the
very
first
said
well,
even
if
just
a
few
stations
are
dropped,
that's
significant.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
opinion,
and
this
goes
back
to
the
very
first
question
the
chief
justice
asked,
and
the
whole
colloquy
we've
been
having
since.
is
there
evidence
in
this
record
that
shows
that
there
is
a
significant
effect--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
must-carry
produces
insofar
as
the
number
of
stations
dropped
or
not
dropped
are
concerned?
