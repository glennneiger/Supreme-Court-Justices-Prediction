mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
make
two
interrelated
points.
the
first
is,
is
that
congress
reasonably
predicted
that
in
the
absence
of
must-carry
there
would
be
significant
injury
to
broadcast
stations
which
would
threaten
the
government
interest
in
preserving
a
multiplicity
of
broadcast
sources,
and
the
second
point
is
that
the
presence
of
must-carry
has
actually
caused
very
modest
and
decreasing
injury
to
cable
operators
and
cable
programs.
first,
on
the
injury
to
broadcast
stations,
congress
did
not
predict
that
the
entire
broadcast
system
would
disappear
without
must-carry,
but
it
did
specifically
predict
in
its
findings
that
without
must-carry,
quote,
additional
local
broadcast
signals
will
be
deleted,
repositioned,
or
not
carried,
and
that
would
threaten
the
multiplicity
of
broadcast
sources
which
was
the
government
interest.
that
prediction
turned
out
to
be
absolutely
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
scalia--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
that's
not
what
i
just
said,
justice
scalia.
the
government's
interest,
described
in
the
house
report,
the
conference
report,
and
the
text
of
the
act,
is,
serving
the
goals
of
section
307(b),
which
is
a
fair,
efficient,
and
equitable
distribution
of
broadcast
resources.
that
has
always
meant
the
system
of
allocation,
which
means
that
each
local
community
should
have
at
least
one
broadcast
outlet,
and
that
each
local
community
should
be
able
to
receive
as
many
diverse
broadcast
sources
as
the
economic
conditions
and
size
of
that
community
dictate.
that's
not
unlimited.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--if
i
could--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--let
me
just
respectfully
refer
you,
justice
scalia,
to
the
house
report
and
the
conference
report,
which
make
clear
what
the
government
interest
is.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
souter,
let
me
respond
first
by
saying
that
congress
was
not
making
a
snapshot
about
a
frozen
historical
past.
it
quite
explicitly
said,
we
are
attempting
to
make
a
predictive
judgment
about
ongoing
trends
and
what
will
happen
in
the
future
to
broadcast
if
we
do
not
enact
must-carry.
here's
what
congress
knew
in
the
non-must-carry
period,
the
trends.
they
knew
that
the
growth
rate
in
broadcast
stations
had
greatly
declined
from
5
percent
to
less
than
2
percent.
they
knew
that
the
number
of
vacant
channels
had
greatly
increased.
in
fact,
the
number
of
vacant
channels
had
increased
as
much
as
the
number
of
new
stations,
because
many
broadcast
stations
had
given
up,
and
were
simply
turning
in
their
construction
permits.
they
knew
that
broadcast
advertising
revenues,
the
lifeblood
of
broadcasting,
had
declined
in
real
dollars
11
percent
during
the
non-must-carry
period,
and
that
by
1991,
broadcast
revenues
were
lower
than
they
were
in
1984.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
did
have
effect
on
the
great
majority
of
broadcast
stations.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
congress
made
the
predictive
judgment
that
there
was
incremental
weakening
of
the
broadcast
system.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
you
should
accept
it
as
final
without
evidence,
but
there
is
evidence.
the
evidence
in
this
record
overwhelmingly
showed,
and
in
fact--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--the
response
is,
there
was
hundreds
of
pages
of
testimony
before
congress
and
in
the
additional
evidence
showing
the
actual
impact
on
broadcast
stations
of
being
denied
carriage.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
meant
they
had
to
cut
back
on
their
programming.
many
of
them
had
to
convert
to
home
shopping
formats,
which
they
did
not
want
to
use,
because
they
didn't
have
enough
money
to
continue
their
other
news
operations.
there
was
serious
injury
to
broadcast
stations.
appellants--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no.
no,
we're
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
because
congress
expressly
found
in
the
act,
another
one
of
the
policy
objectives,
that
they
wanted
to
rely
on
market
forces
to
the
maximum
extent
possible
to
decide
which
broadcast
stations
would
survive
and
which
would
not.
congress
was
not
saying--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
a
judgment
about
a
higher
quality
of
programming.
i
think
it
is
a
judgment
that
the
programming,
if
the
market
could
operate,
would
be
more
responsive
programming
to
the
local
needs
of
a
local
community.
congress
found
that
there
was
a
structural
impediment
to
fair
competition,
the
cable
bottleneck
monopoly.
it
wanted
to
remove
that
structural
impediment
and
then
let
the
market
determine,
based
on
market
needs,
which
stations
would
survive
and
which
would
not.
congress
didn't
dictate
we
want
this
station
to
survive
and
that
not,
which
is
why
a
subsidy
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
specific
policy
objective,
and
would
also
risk
entangling
the
government
in
very
specific
content-based
judgments.
the
government
would
have
to
decide,
if
this
station
is
not
doing
well
in
the
market
because
it
has
poor
programming,
we
have
to
tell
the
station
to
start
putting
on
news,
or
getting
involved
in
really
content-based
judgments.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
in
terms
of
the
owner's
pockets,
congress
knew
that
in
1990
and
1991,
50
percent
of
all
independent
stations,
and
that's
approximately
500,
800
stations,
lost
money,
and
25
percent
of
them
lost
over
$1.26
million
in
those
2
years.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we're
not
talking
about
money
to
put
in
the
owner's
pockets,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
a
broadcast
system
that
was
in
precarious
financial
condition.
they
needed
must-carry
simply
to
survive.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
breyer--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--let
me
give
you
some
evidence,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
the
cable
industry
itself
did
not
dispute
before
congress
that
lack
of
carriage
would
cripple
the
broadcast
industry
and,
in
fact,
in
this
case
we
produced
in
discovery
their
own
documents
in
which
they
studied
this
very
problem
that
you're
asking,
and
they
concluded
that
carriage
is
critical
to
broadcast
stations.
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
2147
and
2158,
those
are
cable
documents
which
are
sealed,
because
the
cable
industry
insisted
that
they
remain
sealed,
but
those
documents
themselves
conclude
that
carriage
is
critical
to
the
survival
of
a
broadcast
station.
it
may
be
that
the
broadcast
station
would
be
forced
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
local
market,
but
its
advertising
revenues
would
shrink
by
at
least
60
percent,
and
without
the
advertising
revenues
lost
to
the
cable
audience
it
wouldn't
have
the
revenue
to
produce
the
programming
that
would
be
responsive
to
the
over-the-air
audience.
that's
what
congress
reasonably
concluded.
let
me
simply
say
that,
with
respect
to
the
injury
to
cable,
that's
modest
indeed.
only
1
percent
of
the
channel
capacity
in
this
nation
is
occupied
by
new,
must-carry
stations
cable
operators
were
forced
to
add.
this
court
also
asked
how
much
channel
capacity,
previously
unused
channel
capacity
could
be
devoted
to
the
carriage
of
must-carry
stations,
and
the
answer,
as
the
evidence
shows,
is
that
87
percent
of
the
time
when
a
cable
operator
was
forced
to
add
a
must-carry
station,
it
did
so
with
previously
unused
channel
capacity.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
