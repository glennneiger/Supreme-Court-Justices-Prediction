but
to
argue
that
it's
better
for
people
to
have
more
news
programs
certainly
reinforces
the
notion
that
it
is
a
content-based
interest
here
that's
being
urged,
and
i
wonder,
general
dellinger,
the
broadcast
stations
and
the
stations
that
aren't
on
cable
are
still
out
there
on
the
air
for
a
viewer
to
receive
if
they
switch
off
of
cable,
aren't
they?
i
mean,
there
are
switches.
i
can
plug
in
a
tv
set
and
pull
in
these
other
stations,
can't
i?

well
then,
why
not
give
them
subsidies?
that's
very
narrowly
tailored.
you
don't
have
to
commandeer
all
the
channels.
if
the
government
is
concerned
about
prosperity
of
the
station,
give
them
a
subsidy.
