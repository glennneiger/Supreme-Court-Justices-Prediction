--following
up
justice
kennedy's
question,
from
the
cable
operator's
side,
is
this
a
diminishing
problem
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
problem
with
must-carry
as
cable,
as
the
channel
capacity
expands,
this
becomes
less
and
less
of
a
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
farr,
suppose...
this
is
not
a
hypothetical.
it
comes
from
justice
o'connor's
opinion
last
time
around...
the
government
simply
said,
to
the
extent
that
you
have
unused
channels,
just
to
that
extent,
you
must
carry,
so
you
can't
leave
any
channels
idle,
but
if
you
fill
them
up
with
cable
programmers,
whatever,
that's
okay.
justice
ruth
bader

general
dellinger,
was
there
any
offset?
were
broadcast
stations
added?
you
recited
the
number
that
were
dropped.
how
many
were
added?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
dellinger,
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
public
stations,
am
i...
and
i'm
talking
about
section
5.
i
thought
that
the
record
showed
that
no
station
went
dark
in
the
mustcarry
period,
that
the
number
of
stations,
the
number
of
stations
in
fact
increased,
and
that
even
membership
revenue
increased,
so
was
there
even...
the
case
that
you're
making,
even
for
what
was
available,
was
even
that
made
out
with
respect
to
the
public
television?
