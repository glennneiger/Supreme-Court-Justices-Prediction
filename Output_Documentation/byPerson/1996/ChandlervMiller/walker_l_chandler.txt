mr.
walker
l.
chandler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1990
the
state
of
georgia
adopted
a
law
requiring
drug
testing
of
all
members
of
the
state
government,
state
employees.
almost
as
an
afterthought,
it
adopted
a
law
requiring
drug
testing
as
a
condition
of
employment
or
candidacy
for
candidates
for
public
office.
the
first
of
those
laws
was
struck
down
in
the
lower
courts.
this
law
was
brought
forward
before
this
court
by
me
and
my
co-plaintiff,
who
ran
for
office
in
1994.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
not
in
the...
as
i
recall,
not
in
the
actual
pleadings
in
the
lower
court.
however--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--your
honor,
i
believe
this
case
would
not
be
moot,
because
it
would
be
capable
of
repetition
and
yet
evading--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--your
honor,
i
plan
to
run
again.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
that
was
not
stated
below.
also,
justice
o'connor,
i...
my
candidacy
and
the
candidacy
of
all
libertarian
party
members
is
premised
on
the
concepts
of
limited
government
and
freedom
from
unconstitutional
searches
and
seizures
among
all
the
other
liberties
reserved
to
the
people
by
the
founding
fathers,
and
in
that
respect
i
would
think
that
ocga
21-2-140
is
violative
of
the
interests
of
all
candidates,
whether
or
not--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
no,
sir,
your
honor,
i
did
not.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
your
honor,
we
filed
this
action
prior
to
submitting
to
the
test,
prior
to
qualification
by
having
this
little
piece
of
paper
that
certified
us
as
being
drug-free.
we
were
the
nominees
of
our
party.
we
had
an
obligation
to
take
forward
the
message
of
our
party,
the
other
messages
of
our
party
in
the
electoral
process,
so
we
essentially
had
no
choice
but
to
submit...
unwillingly,
perhaps,
but
to
submit
to
this
state-ordered
search.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
before
the
election,
your
honor,
in
may
of--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
don't
know,
justice
scalia.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
sir.
we
search
in
vain
the
cases
that
this
court
has
handed
down
which
deal
with
suspicionless
searches
to
find
where
any
blanket
search
of
this
nature,
this
magnitude,
and
lacking
any
showing
of
any
compelling
state
interest,
has
been
granted
by
this
court.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
search.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
a
search,
because
if
the
result
of
that
search
is
that
you
can
no
longer
serve
in
that
agency,
then--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--well,
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that's...
with
all
due
respect,
that's
not
before
the
court,
and...
but
the--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--yes,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--i
would
think
that
it
would
be
a
search
if,
as
a
result
of
that
search,
a
person
could
lose
employment.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
sir.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
search
under
the
principles
of...
that
were
announced
in
schermberger,
which
drew
a
distinction
between
bodily
searches--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--yes,
sir.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
it
may
well
be,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
sir.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
think
it's--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
would
object
to
that,
your
honor,
because
that
would--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--there
is
no
search,
but
i--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--that
would
be
true.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
so
long
as
those...
so
long
as
they
do
not
violate
people's
constitutional
protections.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
or
never
have
been
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor.
you
asked
if
i
would
object,
and
i
would
object
not
on
a
constitutional
grounds--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
fail
to
know
of
a
constitutional
basis
that
that
might
fit
within
that
hypothetical.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
might
have
some
implication
for
free...
free
speech
implications
under
the
first
amendment,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--i
think
that
there
the
court
has
drawn
distinctions
in
the
past
between
bodily
searches
and
financial
disclosure.
i
did
not
object
in
this
case
to
financial
disclosure.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
because
i
think
there
is
a
strong,
compelling
privacy
interest
in
the
person
that
goes
far
beyond
the
compelling...
any
compelling
interest--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--justice
ginsburg,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
think
it's
the
former,
your
honor.
it's
the
actual
giving
up
of
bodily
fluids,
the
insertion
of--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--there
is
a
big
distinction
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
if
i
disclose
my
wealth
i
cannot
be
kept
off
the
ballot.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes
sir,
i
would
deem
it
a
search.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
exactly
sure
of
the
contradiction
that
i've
voiced
here.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
way
to
characterize
it.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
well,
i
certainly
felt
like
it
was
a...
that
a
financial
search
or
a
financial
disclosure
was
a
more
reasonable
government
requirement
than
a
drug
test.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
first,
there
is
no
real
evidence
of
a
real
problem.
there...
this...
the
searches
which
have
been
allowed
by
this
court
have
always
been
narrowly
limited
to
certain
areas...
the
front
line
in
the
war
on
drugs,
drug
interdiction,
the
use
of
firearms,
the
train
accidents,
things
where
a
real
problem
or
a
real
potentiality
has
been
shown,
and
not
mere
hypotheticals.
and
so
the
essence
of
this
case
is
that
this
is
just
yet
another
attempt
at
expansion
of
governmental
power
over
people
for
a
very
symbolic
purpose,
which
is
put
on
the
state
of
georgia.
it's
not
a
test
that's
designed
to
keep
drug
abusers
out
of
office.
it's
a
blanket
search,
carried
out
for
symbolic
purposes
to...
in
my
opinion
to
show
that
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
is
against
drugs.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
federal
court,
but
that
was
a
companion
statute,
not
this
statute.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
the
district
court
in
atlanta.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
a
federal
district
court,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
that
was
in
1990.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
sir.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
this...
a
very
similar
case
was
brought
in
the
district
court.
this
district...
harmon
v.
thornburgh
was
also
decided
in
the
district
court
level
in
1990,
where
the
justice
department
wished
to
test,
have
blanket
tests
of
all
justice
department
attorneys,
and
that
was
held
by
the
court
at
that
time,
the
district
court,
to
be
not
within
the
parameters
announced
by
this
court
in
skinner
and
von
raab.
certiorari
was
sought
in
that
case
by
the
government
and
was
denied.
i
consider
this
case
to
be
almost
exactly
in
line
with
that
particular
case.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
first,
your
honor,
the...
my
coplaintiff,
sharon
harris,
ran
for
commissioner
of
agriculture.
secondly,
there
was
never
any
showing
that
drug
abuse
or
drug
use
in
high
offices
or
any
other
offices
in
georgia
has
been
any
kind
of
a
problem.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
no,
sir,
i
do
not
think
they
can.
i
think
that
a
potential
problem,
a
hypothetical,
potential
problem
is
not
a
real
problem
and
is
therefore
a
symbolic
problem.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
your
honor,
that
might
be
more
permissible
in
my
opinion,
because
then
it
would
at
least
leave
it
to
the
voters
to
decide
whether
they
want
to
choose
a
person
who
submits
to
a
test,
who
passes
a
test--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--or
who
refuses
a
test.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
certainly
object
to
the
search
as
a
prerequisite
to
being...
to
ballot
placement,
justice
scalia.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
in
which
other
case?
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
well,
i'm
just
saying
that
there's...
that
that
would
not...
i
think
it's
for
the
people
of
georgia
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
can
be
on
the
ballot,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
well,
obviously,
your
honor,
i
have
objected
to
the
search.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
would
object
to
that
because,
justice
ginsburg,
there's
no
showing
that
there
is
a
problem.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
believe
this
court
has
held,
at
least
since
the
carroll
case
in
1925,
that
blanket
searches
are
intolerable,
and
that
that
would
just
be
a
blanket
search.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
yes,
sir,
i
believe
it
would
be.
it
would
be
a
blanket
search
required
by
government,
and
i
think
a
blanket
search
of
people
to
determine
whether
or
not
they're
using
drugs,
or
whether
or
not
they
have
a
terminal
illness,
or
whether
or
not
they
have
a
genetic
defect,
or
a
blood-borne
disease...
we
have
to
look
at--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--insofar
as
that
intrusion
is
forced
upon
me
by
the
state,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
do
not
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
there's
a
difference
between
the
contractual
relationship
between
employee
and
an
employer
and
the
political
relationship
between
the
government
and
candidates,
and
people
who
wish
to
be
a
part
of
that
government.
that
would
be
my
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
but
it
may
not
address
the
point
that
you're
concerned
with.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
your
honor,
for
one
thing,
that--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--i
would
even
have
a
problem
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
for
one
thing,
that
presupposes
that
the
person
that's
in
the
high
office
has
broken
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia.
the
person
could
have,
for
example,
been
in
a
jurisdiction
or
another
country
where
such
drug
use
was
not
even
illegal.
therefore,
he
would
not
have
broken
the
laws
under
the
state
of
georgia.
it
is
a
shifting
majority
decides
what
is
legal
and
illegal.
we
see
tobacco,
for
example,
approaching
illegality
in
this
country,
or
portions
thereof.
that
introduces
the
novel
idea
that
a
citizen
of
a
state
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
state
no
matter
where
in
the
world
he
or
she
might
go,
and
that
is
an
element--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--your
honor,
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
matter
of
a
question
of
how
long
ago
was
it,
the
frequency
of
use--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--during
his
term
of
office,
your
honor,
again
it
might
be
a
question
of
frequency.
it
might
be
a
question
of
which
drugs
are
being
talked
about.
it
might
be...
there
might
be
any
number
of
questions--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--if--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--your
honor,
we
would
like
always
for
our
elected
officials
to
be
people
who
obey
the
law.
however,
when
the
founding
fathers
set
forth
the
fourth
amendment's
prohibitions
against
illegal
searches,
i
think
they
realized
that
people
would
be
doing
things
that
were
illegal,
and
the
answer
that
they
sought,
the
answer
that
they
would
not
allow
would
be
blanket,
suspicionless
searches.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
one
of
the
issues
here
is,
are
there
adequate
protections
that
the
people
and
the
governments
have
to
answer
these
questions?
i
think
there
are
already
adequate
protections
in
normal
law
enforcement,
in
the
electoral
process
itself
when
people
can
be
weeded
out.
nothing
prevents
a...
an
opponent
of
a
politician
in
an
election
process
to
hold
out
his
piece
of
paper
saying
he's
been
tested
and
then
challenge
his
opponent
to
be
tested.
nothing
would
prevent
that
sort
of
buffoonery,
and
there's
also
the
adequate
protection
of
a
free
press
and
public
scrutiny.
people
live
their
whole
lives,
and
they
should
be
judged,
perhaps,
by
the
things
that
they
do
and
the
things
that
they
say,
and
not
by
the
products
of
their
bodies.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
an
interesting
aspect
of
the
tenth
amendment
question
to
me
is
that
that
the
states...
that
which
was
not
granted
to
the
federal
government
specifically
was...
the
rights
not
granted
to
the
federal
government
was
reserved
to
the
states
or
the
people
respectively,
and
when
the
states
appear
to
jealously
protect
their
rights,
they
are
not
so
jealous
in
protecting
the
rights
that
the
people
reserved
unto
themselves,
and
one
of
those
rights
is
that
a
citizen
should
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
it
would
not
comfort
me,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--the
state
might
be
in
a
better
position
if
they
had
some
sort
of
random
search
system
for
people
who
had
been
elected
to
office.
however,
i
think
even
such
a
search
would
violate
the
principles
that
have
been
enunciated
by
this
court
in
skinner,
von
raab,
and
the
vernonia
school
district
case,
because
there
has
to
be
some
nexus
between
the
tests,
and
there
has
to
be
some
compelling
state
interest,
and
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of,
not
potential
harm,
but
an
actual
existing
harm.
i
don't
know,
for
example,
that
they've
ever
shown
that
commissioners
of
agriculture
in
georgia
have
a
heavy
drug
problem,
or
for
that
matter
lieutenant
governors.
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
but
i
would
sort
of
think
so.
i
would
also
just--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--a
lot
of
things
happen
in
alabama
that
don't
happen
in
georgia,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
although
arguably--
mr.
walker
l.
chandler
--and
how...
and
also,
your
honor,
how
could
we
argue
that
drug
users
would
be
any
worse
than
the
general
assembly
georgia
has
now.
[laughter]
there's
an
old
saying
down
in
georgia
that
no
man's
liberty
or
property
is
safe
as
long
as
it's
in
session,
and
21.2.140
is
a
perfect
example
of
that,
where
for
the
most
cavalier
of
reasons,
just
pure
symbolism,
they
want
to
take
away
people's
fourth
amendment
rights,
they
want
to
make
people
stand
up
and
take
these
tests
so
as
to
somehow
show
that
they
are...
by
a
piece
of
paper
that
they...
that's
easily
avoided
that
they
can
be
qualified
to
hold
high
office.

this
test
is
even
worse
because
it
involves
cheap
symbolism.
the
other
test
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment
protections
announced
by
this
court
in
von
raab
and
the
other
cases
as
being
suspicionless.
i
would
like
to
just
say
finally
that
this
all
reminds
me
of
what
franklin
warned
us
about,
is
that
people
who
would
give
up
some
of
their
liberty
to
get
some
security
will
end
up
with
neither
liberty
nor
security.
and
we
are
rapidly
approaching
a
time
in
this
country
where
there
are
absolutely
no
technological
limits
to
what
a
government
can
do
to
make
sure
that
people
are
obeying
its
edicts.
there
will
be
a
possibility
of
hair
testing
to
show
that
people
can...
have
used
something
that
the
government
has
declared
illegal
within
the
last
6
or
8
months
based
on
where
in
the
hair...
the
fact
that
we
can
force
obedience
by
these
people
should
not
necessarily
mean
that
we
should
do
so,
especially
if
what
that
means
is
that
we
have
to
give
up
our
constitutional
rights
to
do
so.
thank
you.
