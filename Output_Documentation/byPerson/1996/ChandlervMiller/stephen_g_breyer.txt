justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
does
this
work?
i
mean,
if
a
case
is
moot,
and
then
the
parties
come
to
this
court
and
they
tell
us
something,
a
fact,
make
a
factual
statement
that
would
mean
it
wasn't
moot,
are
we
just
supposed
to
say,
all
right,
now
we
treat
the
amendment
as...
the
complaint
as
if
it
were
amended?
i
mean,
how
does
this
work?
i
mean,
there
might
be
a
lot
of
moot
cases
that
people
could
file
statements
and
say,
well,
we
would
like
here
to
say
a
few
things
we
didn't
say
in
the
district
court
which
will
make
them
not
moot.
are
we
now
supposed
to
treat
all
these
cases
as
if
they
weren't?
i
mean,
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
why
that
matters
if
it
isn't
a
class
action,
and
if
there's
no
claim
that
he
is
going
to
run
again.
i
mean,
a
lot
of
people
would
like
declaratory
relief
on
a
lot
of
theoretical
questions
that
they
have,
very
interesting
questions
of
law,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
does
this
all
work?
i
don't
think
it's
just
enough
to
come
in
and
say,
i
would
like
some
declaratory
relief
here
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
that
you
have
some
plaintiff
to
whom
it
makes
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
it
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
other
people
who
are
clearly
going
to
run?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
a
deadline,
or
is
it
when
he
files?
i
mean,
it's
usually...
say
the
deadline's
september
30.
suppose
he
files
the
preceding
june
30.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
be...
in
other
words,
the
deadline's
september
30.
it
has
to
be
in
the
month
of
september.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
have
to
be
30
days
previous
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
find
one
day
where
you
go
in
and
you're
drug-free.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
how's
that
supposed
to
prove
anything?
i
mean,
i
guess
the
greatest
druggie
in
the
world
could
go
in
and
find
a
day
when
he
was
drug-free.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
that's
what
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
how...
what
are
the
facts?
that
is,
if
a
person
does
take
drugs,
is
it
impossible
to
find
a
day
in
a
30-day
period
when
he's
free
of
drugs
and
would
pass
the
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
he
stays
off
drugs
for
a
month
preceding,
or
2
months
preceding
the
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
long
in
advance
of
the
test
do
you
have
to
stay
off
drugs
if
a
moderate
drug
user,
before
the
moderate
drug
user
is
drug-free
on
the
day
of
the
test?
is
3
weeks
good
enough?
is
4
weeks
good
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
i
mean,
what
is
the
statute
doing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
simply...
what
is
the
theory
behind
the
statute
other
than
making
a
political
statement?
is
it
that
there
are
some
people
who
want
to
run
for
office
who
find
it
impossible
to
refrain
from
drugs
for
22
days
prior
to
their
voluntarily
going
in
and
taking
the
test?
i
mean,
what
is
the
theory
of
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
an
important
purpose,
a
purpose
that
we
find
those
people
in
society
who
are
not
able
to
stay
off
drugs
for
22
days
and
therefore...
is
that
the
basic
idea?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
has
this
court
ever
gone
into
the...
i
mean,
i
thought
in
vernonia,
for
example
they're
like
random
drug-testing.
random
drug-testing,
of
course,
catches
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
there
been
cases
which
are
not
random
drug-testing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
stronger,
isn't
it,
because
it
says...
basically
what
she
said
was
that
this
is
the
state's
interest
only
in
making
certain
that
the
really
serious
drug
users
who
can't
stay
off
drugs
for
30
days,
which
you
have
to
be
quite
a
heavy
user,
that
they
want
to
identify
those
people,
so
she
said
that's
a
very
important
interest,
identifying
these
very,
very
heavy
drug
users,
and
against
that
it's
a
fairly
limited
intrusion.
i
think
that
was
her
point.
so
what
would
your
reply
be
to
that?
