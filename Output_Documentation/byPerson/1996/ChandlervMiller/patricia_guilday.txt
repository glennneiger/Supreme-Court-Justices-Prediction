ms.
patricia
guilday
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
established
in
skinner,
von
raab,
and
acton
the
test
which
permits
drug
testing
in
various
contexts.
the
state
of
georgia
is
not
here
today
to
challenge
that
test
in
any
way
or
to
ask
for
any
extensions
of
that
test.
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
take
the
balancing
of
that
test
and
apply
it
in
a
tenth
amendment
context,
in
the
elections
context.
ms.
patricia
guilday
georgia
thinks
that
the
injunctive
relief
that
mr.
chandler
and
the
co-petitioner
sought
with
respect
to
the
1994
election
is
certainly
moot.
the
complaint
also
included
a
demand
for,
and
the
district
court
also
recognized
that
the
complaint
also
included
a
demand
for
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
merits,
the
constitutional
merit
of
that
statute,
so
to
that
extent,
no,
we
do
not
think
the
case
is
moot.
ms.
patricia
guilday
justice
o'connor,
we
would
admit
that
that
question
is
close.
we
read
closely
this
court's
opinion
in
storer,
norman,
meyer
v.
grant,
and
the
democratic
party
v.
wisconsin,
all
of
which
were
elections
cases.
there
were
various
factual
contexts
in
those
cases,
and
in
many,
or
in
some
at
least,
the
facts
were
similar,
where
the
electior
was
over
and
there
was
no
statement
that
the
particular
candidates
intended
to
run
for
office
in
the
future.
nonetheless,
this
court
held
that
because
it
was
an
elections
context
and
the
issues
were
likely
to
come
before
the
court
again,
that...
i'm
not
sure
which
way
to
read
the
court,
either.
it
was
not
moot,
and
so
we
will
hear
it,
or
it
is
moot,
but
even
though
it
is
moot
we
are
going
to
consider
it
because
it
is
an
elections
context.
ms.
patricia
guilday
i
believe--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--if
it
is
not...
if
it
is
moot,
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
ms.
patricia
guilday
to
be
truthful,
my
reading
of
those
cases
makes
it
unclear
as
to
what
the
court
was
saying
in
each
particular
case.
ms.
patricia
guilday
your
question
asked
whether
it
was
a
pleading--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--no,
we
do
not.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that
is
correct,
but
in
the
elections
context,
whether
this
particular
candidate
decides
to
run
again,
certainly
there
will
be
other
candidates
who
may
make--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--he
did
not.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
guilday
correct,
and
that
was
going
to
be
my
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
if
it
is
a
pleading
defect,
the
fact
that
georgia
comes
in
and
proves
that
he's
not
going
to
run
again,
then
it's
no
longer
a
pleading.
then
it's
evidentiary.
so--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--it
works,
your
honor,
in
fact
that
mr.
chandler
and
the
other
petitioners
pled
in
their
complaint,
or
they
requested
in
their
complaint
for
declaratory
relief
as
well
as
relief--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--this
court--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--this
court
has
responded
to
that
very
argument
in
the
series
of
cases
that
i've
just
cited,
which
are
in
the
elections
context.
they
have
not
required
to
my
reading
of
those
cases
any
actual
allegational
proof
that
the
particular
candidate
who
is
the
plaintiff
in
that
particular
case--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--i
do
not
believe
that
all
of
those
were
class
actions.
i
may
be
wrong
in
that,
but
i
do
not
believe--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
ms.
patricia
guilday
because
we
believed
that
the--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--no,
it
did
not.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
district
court--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--there
is
no
such
record
evidence
in
this
case,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
guilday
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
there
was
not...
and
i'm
not
sure
at
what
stage
you're
talking
about.
at
the
time
the
legislature
passed
this
statute,
georgia
law
has
consistently
held
from
the
beginning
that
in
georgia
the
statute
itself
evidences
the
legislative
history.
there
is
no
recording
of
any
committee
hearings,
of
any
floor
debate,
anything
like
that.
ms.
patricia
guilday
no,
there
is
no
such
evidence,
your
honor,
and
there
is
no...
to
be
frank,
there
is
no
such
problem
as
we
sit
here
today.
ms.
patricia
guilday
i
think
the
question
as
to
whether
there
is
a
special--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--absolutely.
ms.
patricia
guilday
absolutely,
the
court
has
looked
at
special
need.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
special
need
that
georgia
asserts
is
that
in
georgia
the
elected
officials
that
are
included
in
this
statute
are
by
constitution
trustees
and
servants
of
the
public.
they
are,
by
that
constitutional
provision,
held
to
a
much
higher
standard
than
is
the
ordinary
citizen.
they
are,
in
fact,
fiduciaries
to
the
public.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that
requirement
would
raise
issues
involving
the
fifth
amendment.
obviously,
the
opposite
side
of
that
is
a
compelled
statement
as
to
whether
or
not
i
use
drugs.
secondly,
this
statute
does
not
ask
the
candidate
to
say
that
i
use
illegal
drugs.
all
it
does
is
say
the
negative
of
that,
that
on
this
particular--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--i
believe
it
could
not.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that
would
then
raise
questions
as
to
federal
law,
would
that
state
immunity
affect
any
federal
drug
enforcement--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--i
think
the
question
would,
one,
put
in...
it
would
be
more
intrusive
and
be
more
violative
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
individual
to
say,
i
have
or
have
not
in
my
past
used
illegal
drugs.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
compelled...
the
state
is
compelling
him
to
make
a
statement
which
he
may
or
may
not
want
to
make.
ms.
patricia
guilday
i
think
the
state
does
require
that.
ms.
patricia
guilday
it
would
not.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
difference
is,
this
court
has
upheld
the
validity
of
the
financial
disclosure
laws
in
several
cases.
ms.
patricia
guilday
you've
upheld
the
validity
of
drug
laws.
you
have
not
upheld
the
validity
of
a
affidavit...
you
have
not
addressed
the
issue,
to
my
knowledge,
of
an
affidavit
saying
i
have
or
have
not
used
drugs.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
issue
in
the
first
amendment
is,
how
intrusive
is
that
of
the
first
amendment
right?
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
georgia
statute
does
not
require
a
citizen
to
state
that
he
has
violated
the
drug
law.
ms.
patricia
guilday
as
to
an
affidavit
saying
i
have
not
violated
the
drug
laws?
ms.
patricia
guilday
i
still
think
that
is
more
intrusive,
because
it
is
covering
a
larger
period
of
time
than
is
a
drug
test
on
one
specific
day
that
discloses
only
the
presence
of
five
specific
drugs.
ms.
patricia
guilday
this
court
has
established
that
it
is
a
search,
so--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--that
would
not
be
permissible.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
test
comes
down
again
to
balancing
how
intrusive
is
the
nature
of
that
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights
versus
how
intrusive
is
it
in
the
fourth
amendment
context.
ms.
patricia
guilday
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
question
of
which
i
would
rather.
this
court
has
held
in
the
financial
disclosure
area
that
there
are
limits
on
what
those
statutes
can
require.
they
have
not
gotten
so
far...
this
court
and
other
courts
have
not
gone
so
far
to
require
a
full
production
of
income
tax
records,
which
would
reveal
a
variety
of
information...
you
know,
how
many
times
i've
gone
to
the
doctor,
how
many
businesses
i
own,
or
what...
all
of
the
other
financial
transactions
i
might
have
had.
questions--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--that's
the
point
i'm
making,
that
to
compel--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--there's
no--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--the
same
constraints
that
apply
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
first
amendment,
how
in
the
elections
context--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--perhaps
we
should
look
at
the
tenth
amendment.
the
tenth
amendment
says
that
a
candidate
restriction
or
a
ballot
restriction
is
constitutionally
valid
if
it
is
a
reasonable
and
nonarbitrarily
intrusive
restriction
upon
the
individual's
fundamental
rights.
ms.
patricia
guilday
this
court
has
used
the
tenth
amendment
to
authorize
the
states
to
control
their
own
elections,
to
regulate
their
own
elections.
of
course,
within
those
constraints--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--no,
i
do
not
take
that
position
because
criminal--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--my
answer
is--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--yes,
if
it
is
otherwise
constitutional.
your
question--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--no.
ms.
patricia
guilday
no,
and
that
was
going
to
be
my
answer.
no.
criminal
convictions
are
matters
of
public
record
in
most
states.
in
some
states
they
are
not.
and
so
no,
that
would
not
be
a
restriction
that
impinges
the
constitution
in
any
way.
however,
the
financial
disclosure
statements,
because
of
the
privacy
interest
that
that
intrudes,
yes,
does
touch
upon
constitutional
issues,
and
at
that
point
this
court
has
called...
has
made
limits
on
what
information
can
be
revealed.
it's
not
an
across-the-board,
open
all
your
papers
up
to
the--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--i'm
sorry,
your
hypothetical--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--it
comes
back
to
the
same
balancing
test,
and
that
is,
how
invasive
are
those...
is
that
restriction,
or--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--i
think
that
requirement
would
require
the
candidate
to
disclose
much
more
information
than
would
be
permitted
under
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
patricia
guilday
i
do.
ms.
patricia
guilday
exactly,
just
as
this
court
has
held
in
skinner,
von
raab,
and
acton.
ms.
patricia
guilday
i
don't
think
the
distinction
is
body
versus
paper.
i
think
the
distinction
is
what
information
is
disclosed.
ms.
patricia
guilday
i
believe
it
certainly
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
difference
is
in
the
information
that
is
disclosed.
ms.
patricia
guilday
there's
two
distinctions.
in
the
georgia
statute,
yes,
we
require
the
candidate
to
submit
the
urine
sample.
the
information
comes
back
only
to
him.
that
is,
whether
or
not
there
are--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--the
private
investigatory
agency
has
learned
a
substantial
amount
of
information.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
tester
learns
only
the
presence
of
those
five
drugs.
any
other
individual
that
walks
into
a
candidate's
home
or
to
my
home
learns
everything
about
me,
and
i
think
that's
the
distinction,
the
amount
of
information
that's
disclosed
by
the
required
test.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that's
absolutely
true.
ms.
patricia
guilday
not
within
some
30
days
of
your
choosing,
30
days
within
the
qualifying
deadlines
for
the
particular
office
that
you
were
running
for.
ms.
patricia
guilday
no.
this
statute
says--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--the
particular
offices
that
are
involved
in
the
statute
have
particular
times
for
qualifying.
ms.
patricia
guilday
right.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that's
correct.
ms.
patricia
guilday
as
this
court
held
in
von
raab,
perhaps
the
greatest
druggie
in
the
world
could
not.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that,
of
course--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--if
that
particular
individual
can
do
that,
yes,
you're
right,
when
he
goes
in
for
his
drug
test,
his
drug
test
is
going
to
become
positive--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--the
cases
before
this
court
have
cited
expert
testimony
giving
a
range
of
from
22
days
until
a
month
before.
ms.
patricia
guilday
it's
doing--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--i
think
that
is
one
purpose,
to--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--that
is
not
the
primary
reason,
no.
it
is
a
reason
that
this
court
in
von
raab
found
to
be
significant.
in
our
case,
the
primary
purpose
we
would
offer
this
court
for
this
statute
is
that
the
information
that
a
negative
drug
test
gives
to
the
public
about
the
individual
candidate
is
significant.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that's
correct.
ms.
patricia
guilday
von
raab
involved
pre-employment
or
pre-promotion
testing,
one-time
basis,
of
individuals
who
sought
positions
in
the
various
categories.
it
was
not
random
testing.
ms.
patricia
guilday
that
is
our
purpose.
it
is
not
our
position
that
that
is
a
solely
symbolic
purpose.
it
may
have
symbolic
implications,
but
because
a
statute
is
symbolic,
if
it's
otherwise
constitutional,
does
not
render
it
constitutional.
ms.
patricia
guilday
my
way
of
answering
that
question
is
what
i
started
saying
in
the
beginning.
the
fourth
amendment
requires
the
balancing
test
that
this
court
used
in
skinner,
von
raab,
and
acton
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--the
fourth
amendment
always
wins
out
if
in
that
balancing
test
the
government
interests
are
not
sufficient
to
outweigh
the
privacy
interest.
it
is
our
position
that
when
you
do
that
test
in
an
elections
context
in
which
the
people
have
a
right
to
know
anything
about
a
candidate
which
touches
on
their
qualifications
for
office--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--no,
the
balancing
is
no
less
in
that
context.
the
distinction
or
the
reason
for
not
requiring
them
then
primarily
are
procedural.
once--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--everyone
in
the
category
of
offices
that
are
included
in
the
statute,
yes,
i
believe
georgia
could
have--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--i
said
that
and
i...
and
that
is
a
quote
from
one
of
this
court's
cases.
however,
obviously
the
constitution
has
to
define
everything.
ms.
patricia
guilday
it
does.
ms.
patricia
guilday
the
tenth
amendment
argument
is,
in
this
balancing
test
that's
required
in
the
fourth
amendment,
that
in
the
usual
context
the
scales
start
out
even
for
both
sides.
what
the
tenth
amendment
does
is,
it
tips
those
scales
from
the
outset
on
the
side
of
the
government
because--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--because
the
tenth
amendment
in
the
cases
this
court
has
held
in
the
elections
context
say,
we
are
going
to
give
great
deference
to
the
state's
own
characterizations
of
its
interest
in
the
elections
and
in
particular
in
the
qualifications
of
its
elected
officials.
ms.
patricia
guilday
i'm
not
sure
i
understand--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--that's
absolutely--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--the
distinction
being
that
the
tenth
amendment
and
in
particular
the
elections
context
has
repeatedly
been
given
by
this
court
special
consideration.
in
gregory--
ms.
patricia
guilday
--thank
you,
your
honor.
