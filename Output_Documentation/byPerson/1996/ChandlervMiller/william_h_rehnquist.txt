chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-126,
walker
chandler
v.
zell
d.
miller,
governor
of
georgia.
mr.
chandler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chandler--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i'm
wondering
why,
if
you
want
to
raise
this
issue,
you
don't
have
to
refuse
to
take
the
drug
test,
rather
than
go
ahead
and
take
it
and
get
on
the
ballot
and
then
challenge
it
later.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
here,
mr.
chandler,
does
single
out
certain
high-ranking
state
offices,
and
i
think...
i
would
think
you're
in
a
position...
you
ran
for
what,
lieutenant
governor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
requirement
for
lieutenant
governor.
i
don't
know
that
you're
in
a
position
to
challenge
requirements
for
other
offices
which
you
didn't
seek,
and
certainly,
don't
you
think
there
is
an
argument
on
behalf
of
the
state
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
have
a
lieutenant
governor
who
is,
free
of
drug
use?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
georgia,
then
you
feel
can't
adopt
a
prophylactic
rule
that
says
we
want
to
make
sure
it
doesn't
become
a
problem?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
georgia
statute,
instead
of
reading
the
way
it
does,
had
said
everybody
has
to
take
this
drug
test
but
anybody
can
get
on
the
ballot.
all
you
have
to
do
is
announce
the
results
of
your
drug
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they're
illegal
drugs--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--would
you
distinguish
between
illegal
drugs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
chandler.
ms.
guilday,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
reason
for
saying
that
the
state
could
not
require
an
affidavit
that
you
had
not
used
illegal
drugs
as
a
candidate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
first
amendment
right
is
violated
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
state
were
to
require
a
candidate
to
file
an
affidavit
saying
that
he
had
complied
with
the
financial
disclosure
laws
of
the
state,
and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
would
that,
too,
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
one
different
from
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we've
never
upheld
the
validity
of
drug
laws?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
isn't
the
first
amendment
issue,
if
there
is
one,
the
same
in
each
case?
in
each
case
perhaps
a
candidate
is
unwilling
to
make
that
statement,
and
yet
nonetheless
the
state
requires
it
of
him
before
he
goes
on
the
ballot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
more
intrusive
to
find
out
that
a
person
has
violated
the
drug
laws
than
they've
violated
the
financial
disclosure
laws?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
this
is
a
hypothetical.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
wouldn't
have
thought
you
could
derive
all
of
that
from
the
tenth
amendment.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
ballot
restrictions
that
i
know
of.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chandler,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
they
show
that
there
was
a
commission
of
agriculture
in
alabama
and
a
lieutenant
governor
in
alabama
who
turned
out
to
drug
addicts.
does
georgia
have
to
wait
for
it
to
happen
in
georgia?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chandler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
...against
miller
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
