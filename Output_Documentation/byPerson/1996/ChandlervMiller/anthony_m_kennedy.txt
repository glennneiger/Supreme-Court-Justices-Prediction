justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
didn't
seek
to
bring
this
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
candidates.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
a
state
agency
said,
in
the
interests
of
all
of
our
employees,
everyone
once
a
year
must
take
a
physical
exam.
we
don't
want
to
know
the
results.
all
we
want
you
to
do
is
to
say
that
you've
gone
to
a
doctor,
any
doctor
you
want,
for
a
physical
examination.
is
that
a
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
does
a
search
arise,
when
you
go
into
the
doctor's
office?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
the
results
are
disclosed
only
to
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
no,
the
agency
says,
we
don't
care
what
the
medical
exam
discloses.
we
just,
in
the
interests
of
our
employees
we
want
you
to
be
examined
once
a
year.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
before
the
court
that
are
going
to
be
before
the
court
based
on
this
opinion,
and
so
we
have
to
write
an
opinion
that
covers
more
than
your
particular
case
because
we're
interested
in
the
general
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i'm
asking
why
this
is
a
search.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
my
hypothetical.
all
you
have
to
do
is
go
to
the
doctor
and
just
certify
that
you've
had
a
physical
exam
once
a
year
at
a
doctor
of
your
choice.
the
agency
says
we
want
to
do
this
in
the
interests
of
our
employees,
and
that
may
well...
we
can
play
with
the
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
agency
pays
for
it,
or
whatever.
why
is
that
a
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
to
say,
schmerber?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
the...
involuntarily
a
needle
was
inserted
in
the...
with
the
patient
by
a
doctor
who
was
not
of
his
choice
at
a
time
that
was
not
of
his
choice.
he
had...
he
was
there,
on
the
gurney,
in
custody.
but
that's
quite
different,
it
seems
to
me,
from
just
saying
go
to
a
doctor
once
a
year.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't--
--and
is
it
the
personal
interest
in
not
having
to
strip
and
have
needles
inserted,
or
is
it
the
personal
interest
in
not
disclosing
the
results,
because
if
it's
the
latter,
then
your
case
is
perhaps
more
difficult.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
most
people
would
think
that
that's
more
of
an
invasion
of
privacy,
just
going
to
the
doctor
once
a
year,
than
having
to
disclose
all
of
your
financial
records,
all
of
your
holding,
all
of
your
poverty
or
all
of
your
wealth,
as
the
case
may
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
that
be
the
same
if
every
employee
was
required
to
get
a
physical
examination
once
a
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
because
you
object
to
the
intrusion
of
going
into
the
doctor's
office,
not
the
disclosure
of
the
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you'd
have
no
problem
with
the
law
saying...
or
maybe
you
do,
but
if
a
high
official,
say
the
governor,
uses
drugs,
he
is
immediately
disqualified
from
office,
illegal
drugs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
have
a
problem
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
drug
use
is
irrelevant
to
the
abilities
and
the
qualifications
of
a
public
officeholder?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
just
suppose,
during
his
term
of
office.
