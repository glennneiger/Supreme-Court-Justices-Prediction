justice
antonin
scalia
when
did
you
file
the
suit,
before
the
election
or
after
the
election?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
at
that
time
there's
no
doubt
that
the
case
was
not
moot.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
that
time
it
was
very
much
alive.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
complaint
is
that
you...
what,
that
you
didn't
amend
your
complaint
in
order
to
assert
repetition
after
the
election?
have
we
ever
required
that,
amending
a
complaint
in
a
suit
that
originally
was
not
moot
in
order
to
aver
that
mootness
has
not
occurred?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
recall
we've
ever
required
that.
anyway,
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
you
represent
to
us
that
you
intend
to
run
again,
that
this
issue
will
arise
again
if
the
georgia
law
stands?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
well
be?
you
think...
i
assume
this
physical
exam
requires
a
strip,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
that
that's
not
a
search,
requiring
you
to
go
to
somebody
else
and
strip
down
and
have
that
person
examine
your
body?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
possibly
could
be
a
search
if
that's
not
a
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
might
want
to
argue
about
whether
it's
an
unreasonable
search,
but
you
don't
have
any
doubt
it's
a
search,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
chandler,
every
invasion
of
privacy
is
not
a
search,
is
it?
are
you
willing
to
equate
every
invasion
of
privacy
with
a
search?
i
mean,
would
you
consider
it
a
search
if,
instead
of
having
someone
examine
you
physically
to
decide
whether
you
have
cocaine
in
your
body,
you
are
required
to
disclose
whether
you
have
cocaine
in
your
body?
i
mean,
that
may
be
an
invasion
of
privacy,
but
is
it
a
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
a
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when
i
ask
you,
you
know,
are
you
a
drug
addict,
i'm
searching
you?
words
have
no
meaning
if
we're
going
to
talk
like
that.
why--
--you
just
told
me
it
wasn't,
so
which
answer
are
you
giving?
you
answered
to
me
that
no,
it
wouldn't
be
a
fourth
amendment
search,
but
i'd
object,
and
now
you
tell
justice
scalia,
yes,
it's
a
search.
now,
which
answer
do
you
want
to
abide
by
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
were
complaining
about
the
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
search
would
be
exactly
the
same
in
that
situation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
would
it
be
any
better?
i
mean,
if
your
real
objection
is
the
search,
your
answer
should
be,
you
know,
no,
it's
just
as
bad.
i
think
he's
capable
of
answering
himself.
well,
but
he's
not
capable,
perhaps,
of
perceiving
whether
what
he's
objecting
to
is
the
search,
chief
justice.
if...
maybe
you're
not
objecting
to
the
search,
then.
you
have
some
other
problem
than
the
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
there
a
search
in
this
other
case?
but
you
don't
object
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
case
the
chief
justice
put
to
you,
where
you
had
to
undergo
the
same
search,
but
you
could
run
whether
it
came
out
positive
or
negative.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
i
just
don't
understand,
given
that
your
objection
is
to
the
search--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
you
would
not...
if
it
is
to
the
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it's
not.
i
don't
understand
why
you
would
not
find
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
just
as
bad
as
the
one
that
you
confront.
you
can't
run
unless
you
get
searched.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
we
didn't
say
that.
[laughter]
i
mean,
if
it
is
moot,
how
would
we
have
article
iii
jurisdiction
at
all?
that's
jurisdictional.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it's
a
pleading
question,
ms
guilday,
that
whether
a
case
is
moot
or
not
depends
on
what
has
been
pleaded,
as
opposed
to
what
exists?
suppose
he
pleaded
that
he
would
run
again
but
you
could
demonstrate
that
he
has
no
intention
of
running
again,
wouldn't
the
case
be
moot?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
moot
if
he
has
no
intention
of
running
again.
if
he
intends
to
run
again
and
you
accept
that
he...
do
you
deny
that
he
intends
to
run
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
case
is
not
moot.
there
is
such
a
case
where
the
person
said
he
was
not
going
to
run
again
and
this
court
did
hold
it
moot.
i
forgot
the
name
of
it.
but
there
are
other
temporal
things,
like
residency
to
qualify
to
vote,
or
pregnancy,
that
inevitably
are
going
to
be
over
for
that
particular
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
guilday,
as
i
understand
it,
when
this
complaint
was
filed
he
didn't
have
to
assert
that
he
intended
to
run
again
because
the
election
had
not
yet
occurred.
there
was
clearly
no
mootness
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
issue
is
whether
he
had
some
obligation
after
the
election
to
amend
the
complaint.
now,
is
there
some
obligation?
did
the
state,
after
the
election,
move
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
mootness?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
state
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
would
he
amend
his
complaint?
did
the
court
ask
him
to
amend,
to
come
forward
to
show
that
what
was
originally
clearly
not
moot
is
now
moot?
did
the
court
make
any
such
request?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine
why
he
would
have
amended
his
complaint,
no
one
having
raised
this
issue.
and
justice
scalia
will
correct
me
on
this
if
i
am
mis-citing
1653,
but
it
does
say
that
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction
may
be
amended
in
a
trial
or
appellate
court,
so--
--thank
you
for
the
law,
justice
ginsburg.
[laughter]
ms.
guilday,
may
i
ask
you
whether
there
is
any
place
in
the
record
in
this
case
where
we
might
find
evidence
of
some
particular
or
special
need
in
georgia
for
a
suspicionless
general
search
program
for
candidates
for
office
in
georgia?
is
there
any
place
where,
in
this
record,
we
might
find
that,
oh,
there
have
been
a
number
of
officeholders,
state
officeholders
in
georgia
who
have
turned
out
to
have
drug
problems?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
rather
have
your
papers
searched
than
your
body
searched?
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
that
that's...
as
far
as
intrusiveness
is
concerned--
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
amount
of
what
is
searched
also.
isn't
that
relevant
also?
i
mean,
wouldn't
your
answer
be
different
if
the
test
in
question,
even
though
it
only
came
up
with
those
five
drugs,
is
a
test
that
required
a
full
body
search,
body
cavity
search
and
everything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
point
here
is
this
is
just
a
urinalysis.
that's
all
that's
involved.
how
does
this
test
work,
actually?
like...
i
don't
see
how...
i'm
not
totally
familiar
with
how
the
statute
works.
it
sounds
as
if
it
tells
a
candidate,
well,
in
some
30-day
period
of
your
choosing
go
in
and
get
a
drug
test.
is
that
what
it
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr
chandler,
do
you
think
this
case
would
be
stronger
for
the
state
if
it
was
random
drug-testing?
does
that
thought
comfort
you,
if
they
amended
this
statute
to
make
it
random?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
state
have
to
show
that
he
was
a
worse
secretary
of
agriculture
because
of
that
drug
habit?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
supposed
to
be
good
for
poetry.
i
don't
know
what
it
does
for--
[laughter]
