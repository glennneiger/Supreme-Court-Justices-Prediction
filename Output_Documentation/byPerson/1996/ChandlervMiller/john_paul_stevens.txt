paul

mr.
chandler,
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
you
mentioned
that
there
was
a...
the
statute
originally
applied
to
all
state
employees,
and
that
that
was
held
invalid.
was
that
by
georgia
courts
or
a
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
who
held
it
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
state
district
court,
or
a
federal
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
case
appealed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
was
that?
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--1990.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
in
that
connection
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
or
not
to
require
an
affidavit?
at
least
it
would
not
be
a
search,
whereas
i
think
you
would
agree
that
this
test
does
involve
a
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
similarly
we
go
into
the
financial
disclosure
area
and
say
an
affidavit
describing
one's
finances
would
not
be
a
search,
but
do
you
think
under
the
reasoning
you're
advancing
in
this
case
that
georgia
could
constitutionally
require
every
candidate
for
public
office
to
say
not
only
what
his
finances
are
but
say,
you
may
examine
all
of
my
private
papers
in
order
to
be
sure
i
haven't
committed
a
violation
of
law
in
the
past,
and
you'd
get
a
full
picture
of
my
finances.
so
instead
of
a
financial
disclosure
statement,
we
just
say,
you
may
search
my
papers,
all
of
my
private
papers
to
try
and
find
out
if
i've
been
guilty
of
any
wrongdoing.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not,
because
it
would
probably
weed
out
the
unqualified
candidates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you...
have
you
finished
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor?
can
you...
can
i
get
you
back
to
the
fourth
amendment?
that's
the
part
of
this
case
that
i'm
most
interested
in,
because
it
does
raise
a
fourth
amendment
issue.
do
you
agree
that
if
the
state
required,
as
a
condition
for
running
for
office,
that
the
candidate
must
allow
a
representative
of
the
state
to
make...
or,
say,
a
certified
public
accountant
of
his
own
choosing
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
all
his
financial
papers,
including
his
income
tax
returns...
i
don't
think
there's
any
federal
statute
that
says
he
can't
make
his
income
tax
returns
available
if
he
wants
to...
that
that
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
do
you
think
it
would
or
would
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
hypothetical
is,
the
state
requires
not
just
a
financial
disclosure
affidavit,
but
an
opening
up
of
the
candidate's
records
for
examination
by
a
representative
of
the
election
commission,
or
whatever
it
is,
to
find
out
if
this
man
may
have
committed
some
crimes
or
done
a
lot
of
bad
things
that
the
electorate
would
like
to
know
about,
such
as
possibly
buying
and
selling
drugs
from
time
to
time,
which
might
be
revealed
by
his
financial
records.
in
order
to
accomplish
that
goal,
could
they
require
that
sort
of
a
general
requirement
of
candidates?
reveal
your
financial
papers.
we
don't
want
to
trust
your
word
that
you
did
or
did
not
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
invasive
in
that
they
reveal
everything
that's
in
writing
in
your
private
files
about
your
correspondence
with
people
and
your
financial
transactions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
violate...
that
statute
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
reason
for
saying,
this
is
different,
is
that
the
search
is
less
intrusive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
rely
on
the
public's
right
to
know
everything
about
the
candidate,
as
i
think
you
described
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
justify
a
totally
unrestricted
search
of
the
house
and
all
private
papers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
constitution
looks
a
little
more
closely
at
totally
suspicionless
searches,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i
take
it...
or
i
took
it
that
part
of
your
argument
for
the
state
interest
that
sort
of
overcomes
the
private
interest
here
is
based
on
the
tenth
amendment,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
that
argument.
i
mean,
i
take
it
you
do
not
argue
that
the
tenth
amendment
in
effect
gives
the
state
some
kind
of
right
or
some
dispensation
from
the
fourth
amendment,
so
what
is
the
tenth
amendment
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
your
real
argument
they
have
to
wait
at
least
till
it
happens
in
alabama.
