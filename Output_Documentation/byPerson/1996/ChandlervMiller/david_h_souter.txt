mr.
chandler,
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
assuming
that
you
had
actually
to
disclose
papers,
produce
papers
as
distinct
simply
from
producing
information,
so
that
there
really
were...
in
the
same
sense
that
we're
talking
with
here,
there
really
were
a
search
involved,
i
take
it
that
your
answer
would...
i
take
it
that
your
answer
to
the
question
would
not
necessarily
be
the
same
as
your
position
here,
because
the
governmental
interests
involved
are
different.
you
might
or
might
not
think
the
government
had
a
sufficient
interest
in
requiring
that
kind
of
production
from
its
political
candidates,
but
at
least
the
government's
justification,
what
we
would
look
to
to
decide
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
not
would,
i
take
it,
in
your
view
be
different
from
the
weight
of
the
government's
justification
in
this
case.
is
that
a
fair
way
to
characterize
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
real
argument
before
us,
i
take
it,
doesn't
go
to
the
scope
of
what
is
or
is
not
a
search,
but
the
scope
of
what
is
permissible
on
the
grounds
that
the
government
does
have
a
justification
which
is
sufficiently
weighty
to
make
that
search
a
reasonable
one.
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
and
what
is
your
reason
for
saying
that
this
particular
search
is
not
a
reasonable
one?
what's
the
nub
of
your
attack
on
the
government's
justification?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
chandler,
i
think
the
issue
that's
been
raised
is
at
least
so
far
not
an
issue
of
search,
as
such,
but
an
issue
of
substantive
qualification.
do
you
think
there
is
anything
unconstitutional
about
a
state
law
provision
to
the
effect
that
an
officeholder
who
commits
a
crime...
let's
make
it
easy,
a
crime
in
the
state,
under
state
law,
forfeits
his
office?
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it
is
a
body
search
as
opposed
to
a
paper
search?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
a
case...
let's
take
a
building
search.
i
suppose
the
state
has
just
as
much
interest
in
assuring
itself
that
its
candidates
and
its
officers
are
not
drug
possessors
and
drug
dealers
as
it
has
in
assuring
them
that
they
are
at
least
not
current
drug
users.
would
it
violate
the
fourth
amendment
to
require
a
candidate
to
open
his
house
to
a
search
by
some
private
investigatory
agency
which
would
then
certify
after
the
search
that
no
drugs
were
found
there?
would
that
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why
is
opening
the
house
less
intrusive
than
opening
the
body?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
information
in
the
one
case
says
there
are
no
drug
residues
in
the
body,
and
the
information
in
the
other
case
is,
there
are
no
drugs
in
the
house.
why
is
there
a
significant
distinction
between
those
two
disclosures?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
then
has
to
pass
it
on...
and
i
guess
i
was
assuming...
maybe
i
didn't
state
it
carefully
enough,
but
i
was
assuming
that
in
my
example
he
would
have
to
pass
on
the
certification
from
the
private
investigatory
agency.
in
each
case
the
candidate
could
withhold
the
certification
and
be
disqualified.
assuming
that,
is
there
any
distinction
in
principle
or
practice
between
the
degree
of
intrusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
so
does
the
laboratory
or
the
tester
in
the
case
of
the
bodily
search.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
no
question
of
there
being
an
assertable
tenth
amendment
interest
there,
but
there's
no
question
about
there
being
an
assertable
tenth
amendment
interest
to
prosecute
homicide,
but
that
doesn't
affect
the
balancing
that
goes
on
in
determining...
or
that
does
not
affect
the
fourth
amendment
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
suppose
if
someone
challenged
the
right
of
the
state
to
prosecute
murder
we
would
say,
well,
that
certainly
is
not
one
of
those
powers
that
was
taken
away
from
the
state
when
the
national
constitution
was
ratified.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
see
how
that
would
affect
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
when
somebody
objected
to
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
that
had
resulted
in
evidence
that
the
state
wanted
to
introduce
in
a
homicide
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we've
said
that
a
great
deal
of
discretion
over
elections
is
within
the
state's
power,
but
that's
as
far
as
we've
gone,
isn't
it?
thank
you,
ms.
guilday.
