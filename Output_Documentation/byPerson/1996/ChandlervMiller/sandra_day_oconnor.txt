mr.
chandler--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
say
that
the
petitioners
ran
for
office
in
'94,
and
in
the
petition
you
brought
here
there's
no
assertion
that
any
of
the
petitioners
plan
to
run
again
in
the
future,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
so
how
would
we
have
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
would
it
be
if
none
of
the
petitioners
plan
to
run
again?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
was
not
stated--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
that's
a
merits
argument,
certainly,
but
normally
we
would
look
to
see
if
there's
some
situation
in
a
case
like
this
of
being
capable
of
repetition
and
avoiding
any
review,
and
normally
we
would
look
to
see
some
avowal
that
yes,
indeed,
these
petitioners
or
at
least
one
of
them
intends
to
run
again.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
chandler,
would
you
have
any
problem
if
what
the
state
did
instead
of
requiring
a
drug
test
within
30
days
of
filing
your
nominating
petition
is
require
every
candidate
for
the
state
office
to
file
an
affidavit
certifying
that
the
candidate
is
not
now
and
has
not
in
the
past
used
or
ingested
illegal
narcotic
drugs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
search.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
be
here
on
the
basis
that
you
are
here
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
a
state
has
wide
latitude,
does
it
not,
to
define
qualifications
for
state
office?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
constitutional
protection
would
be
violated
by
requiring
such
an
affidavit,
that
to
be
a
candidate
for
state
office
you
certify
that
you're
not
a
drug
abuser?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking
on
what
constitutional
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
just
wouldn't
like
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
chandler,
i
guess
the
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
whether
the
search
is
reasonable.
now,
does
it
enter
into
the
balance
of
whether
it's
reasonable
at
all
if
it
were
shown
that
the
virtually
universal
experience
of
private
employers
is
to
require
an
annual
physical
of
employees,
or
to
require
a
periodic
drug
testing?
does
that
affect
the
balance
when
we
look
at
a
state-ordered
search
or
not?
does
it
affect
what's
reasonable,
the
general
practice
in
the
private
community?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
georgia
think
this
case
is
moot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
in
the
absence
of...
that
the
petitioners
would
seek
office
in
the
future,
and
in
the
absence
of
a
class
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
could
we
say,
even
if
it's
moot
we
have
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
said
that's
what
we
have
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
any
offered
by
the
state
and
rejected?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
indication
anywhere
in
this
record
that
georgia
has
a
particular
problem
here
with
state
officeholders
being
drug
abusers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
this
court,
in
dealing
with
suspicionless
searches,
looked
to
what
special
needs
there
might
be
that
would
be
an
indication
that
a
suspicionless...
a
blanket,
suspicionless
search
would
be
appropriate?
isn't
that
what
we've
looked
to?
is
there
a
special
need
for
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
looked
to
that,
or
not?
von
raab
or
other
cases
on
which
you
rely,
has
this
court
looked
at
a
special
need
by
the
government--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
a
suspicionless
search
program?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
so
what
is
the
need
georgia
asserts
here
that
is
special?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
georgia
require,
instead
of
a
physical
search,
an
affidavit
of
a
proposed
candidate
that
that
candidate
is
not
now
and
has
not
been
in
the
past
a
drug
abuser,
or
user
of
illegal
drugs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
a
state
could
not
ask
a
candidate
to
make
some
affidavit
or
certification
regarding
illegal
drug
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
the
state
offers
criminal
immunity
for
making
that
statement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
suppose
there
are
federal
laws
that
say
income
tax
returns
are
not
open
to
examination
by
third
parties.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there's
no
federal
law,
is
there,
saying
that
a
state
may
not
require
a
proposed
candidate
to
make
certain
certifications
or
affidavits
before
being
a
candidate?
there's
no
federal
law
about
that,
is
there--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--restricting
the
qualifications
that
a
state
may
set
for
its
elected
officials?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
the
first
amendment
is
violated
by
seeking...
by
a
state
requiring
an
affidavit
of
a
potential
candidate
disclosing
all
criminal
offenses
of
which
the
candidate
has
been
convicted
in
the
past?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
take
the
position
that
a
state
cannot
ask...
make
it
a
requirement
for
a
candidate
for
state
office
to
file
an
affidavit
disclosing
criminal
offenses
of
which
that
proposed
candidate
has
been
convicted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
just
did
in
response
to
my
question,
so
what
is
your
answer?
can
a
state
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes
or
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
other
constitutional
issues
does
that
raise?
these
are
matters
of
public
record.
is
it
some
constitutional
violation
to
require
an
affidavit
on
some
matter
of
public
record--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
a
proposed
candidate?
