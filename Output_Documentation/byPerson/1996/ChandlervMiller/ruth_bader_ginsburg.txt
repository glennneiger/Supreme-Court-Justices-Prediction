justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you
had
to
take
an
oath
that
you
have
never
been
disloyal
to
the
government
of
the
united
states,
of
a
state,
or
you've
never
been
a
member
of,
say,
the
socialist
party,
then
you
might
have
an
objection
under
a
different
amendment
than
the
one
you're
claiming,
but
you
are
claiming
the
fourth
amendment,
and
you
are
doing
it
in
relation
to
a
bodily
intrusion.
the
fourth
amendment
puts
on
the
same
line
as
the
security
of
one's
person
the
security
of
one's
papers.
would
you
then
question
the
requirement
that
if
you
run
for
office
you
must
do
a
complete
financial
disclosure
which
will
involve
disclosing
papers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fourth
amendment
does
say
persons,
houses,
papers,
so
why
would
you
say
that
it's
all
right
to
demand
papers
but
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
person?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
do
you
get
that
from
in
the
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
take
another
example.
no
testing
before,
but
the
moment
you
are
elected
to
office,
you
must
have
a
test
and
you
must
repeat
it
annually.
would
you
object
to
that?
then
the
voters
make
their
choice
without
any
requirement
of
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well
then,
how
does
that
differ
from
in
between
the
time
that
you're
on
the
ballot
and
the
time
that
you're
elected?
what
is
the
difference
in
my
situation,
in
the
question
that
i
pose
and
the
one
that
justice
scalia
posed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
didn't
ask
for
a
class
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
has
represented
in
court
today
that
he
does
intend
to
run
again.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
it's
a
pleading
defect,
it's
a
curable
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
guilday,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
your
major
reason,
georgia's
major
reason
is
symbolic
to
the
extent
i
think
you
said
they
wanted
the
public...
they
wanted
the
people
who
were
in
public
office
to
have
what
it
takes
to
exercise
their
best
judgment.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
is
my
question,
then.
if
it
comes
down
to,
this
is
not
like
the
random
test
that's
designed
to
catch
people
but
is
in
part
symbolic,
and
the
state
is
making
a
judgment,
and
then
we
have
a
constitution
with
the
fourth
amendment
in
it,
if
we're
choosing
between
the
public
perception,
the
lesson
that
we
want
to
teach
the
people,
doesn't
the
constitutional
amendment
come
first,
come
before
the
notion
that
we
want
people
to
show
that
they
can
exercise
their
best
judgment
by
being
willing
to
submit
to
drug
testing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
question
to
you
is,
then,
doesn't
the
fourth
amendment
always
win
on
that
balance
unless
you
have
a
good
reason,
a
reason
beyond,
we
want
to
show
that
these
people
take
tests.
one
reason
is
that
you
would
catch
people,
as
was
the
case
in
the
train
engineer,
but
here
that's
not
the
purpose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
go
for...
once
they're
in
office,
and
they're
going
to
be
in
and
maybe
run
for
election,
so
do
this
periodically?
can
people
have
any
less...
is
their
interest
any
less
if
we're
doing
this
balancing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could...
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
georgia
could
say,
annually,
or
even
randomly,
everyone
in
office
in
this
state
has
to
have
a
drug
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
point
that
you
made
in
your
brief
was
that
this
is...
this
test
is
not
very
serious
because
it
would
catch
at
best
the
worst
cases,
but
you
certainly
wouldn't
find
more
satisfactory
a
test
that
was
less
hard
to
beat,
a
test
more
pervasive,
so
i
didn't
understand
your
point
about
the
lack
of
effect
of
this
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
review
and
reverse
in
this
case,
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
1990,
georgia
enacted
a
law
requiring
candidates
for
certain
state
offices
to
certify
that
they
have
taken
a
urinalysis
drug
test
and
that
the
test
result
was
negative.
petitioners

party
nominees
for
lieutenant
governor
and
other
elected
officers.
proceeding
in
federal
court,
they
challenged
georgia’s
ballot
access
drug
testing
law
as
incompatible
with
the
fourth
amendment
but
the
fourth
amendment’s
protection
against
unreasonable
searches.
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
drug
testing
scheme.
it
is
uncontested
that
the
urine
collection
and
test
georgia
requires
counts
as
asserts
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
it
intrudes
untraditional
expectations
of
privacy.
the
pivotal
question
we
confront
is
whether
the
search
is
reasonable.
to
be
reasonable,
a
search
ordinarily
must
stem
from
individualized
suspicion
of
wrongdoing.
exceptions
to
the
main
rule
of
suspicion
focused
on
particular
individual
maybe
warranted
however,
when
the
state
has
special
needs
beyond
the
normal
need
for
law
enforcement.
we
have
upheld
as
justified
by
such
special
needs,
drug
testing
programs
for
student
athletes,
custom
service
offices
transferred
to
dangerous
or
sensitive
post,
and
railway
employees
involved
in
accidents
and
safety
violations.
relying
on
these
precedents,
the
eleventh
circuit
concluded
that
the
georgia
statute
satisfied
the
fourth
amendment’s
reasonableness
requirement.
in
an
opinion
distinguishing
our
prior
decisions,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
georgia’s
requirement
that
candidate
for
state
office
pass
a
urinalysis
drug
test
does
not
fit
within
the
closely
guarded
category
of
constitutionally
permissible
suspicion
list
searches.
the
statute,
all
agree,
was
not
enacted
in
response
to
any
fear
or
suspicion
of
illegal
drug
use
by
georgia
state
officials.
counsel
for
respondents
acknowledged
the
absence
of
any
such
problem
in
the
state
and
the
certification
requirement
is
not
well
designed
to
identify
candidates
who
violate
anti-drug
laws.
the
test
date
is
picked
by
the
candidate,
so
all
but
the
uncontrollably
addicted
for
the
state
protection.
respondents
rely
heavily
on
our
decision
in
treasury

v.
von
raab
in
which
we
sustained
a
drug
testing
program
for
custom
service
employees
transferred
to
certain
high
risk
positions.
we
did
so
despite
the
absence
of
documented
evidence
of
a
drug
abuse
problem
among
custom
service
employees
but
von
raab
arose
in
a
unique
setting,
drug
interdiction
had
become
the
agency’s
primary
enforcement
mission
and
the
covered
posts
directly
involved
drug
interdiction
or
require
the
employee
to
carry
a
firearm.
the
solitary
nature
of
the
customs
service
employees'
work
limited
to
service
could
not
these
of
the
subject
the
offices
in
question
to
the
day-to-day
scrutiny
that
is
a
norm
in
more
traditional
work
environment.
in
contrast,
the
day-to-day
conduct
of
candidates
for
public
office
attract
attention
notably
beyond
the
norm
in
ordinary
work
environments.
what
is
left
after
close
review
of
georgia
scheme,
is
the
state
interest,
not
in
public
safety
but
in
projecting
an
image,
georgia
seeks
to
display
to
the
public
its
firm
commitment
to
the
struggle
against
drug
abuse.
the
need
projected,
unlike
the
need
demonstrated
in
prior
decisions
is
symbolic,
not
actual
and
special.
however
well
meant,
the
candidate
drug
test
that
georgia
has
devised
diminishes
personal
privacy
for
a
symbol’s
sake.
the
fourth
amendment
shields
society
against
state
action
of
that
kind.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
