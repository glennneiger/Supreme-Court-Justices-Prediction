mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
by
addressing
an
argument
that
i
began
thinking
about
about
8:00
last
night,
and
that
is
the
nontariff
argument
that
was
just
made.
it's
a
very
clever
argument,
because
what
it
does
is
try
to
take
on
what
i
think
is
our
best
argument.
our
best
argument
is
that
the
marketers
are
trying
to
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too.
they
want
the
benefits
of
utility
status,
but
not
the
burdens.
and
what
general
motors
is
now
saying
is,
they're
saying,
well,
that's
not
actually
true,
the
utilities
are
trying
to
do
the
same
thing,
and
that's
the
reason
they've
relied
on
this
1987
order,
and
that's
the
reason
they
suggested
that
there
actually
were
nontariff
sales
by
utilities
during
the
audit
period.
that's
a
great
argument.
it's
just
not
supported
by
the
record
or
by
the
law.
it's
not
supported
by
the
record
because
if
you
look
at
pages
229
and
230,
it
doesn't
make
any
indication
that
there
were
actually
nontariff
sales
during
the
audit
period,
1987
through
1989.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
that
indicates
that.
the
notion
that
20
percent
of
the
sales
to
industrial
consumers
were
nontariff
sales
is
also
unsupported.
that's
simply
not
true.
but
let
me--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
yes,
i
think
you
do,
but
i
can
make
another
point,
and
that
is
that
even
if
they
were
nontariff
sales,
let's
say
the
record
actually
did
support
their
argument,
they've
got
another
hurdle
to
clear,
and
that's
that
ohio
has
a
doctrine
called
the
dual
capacity
doctrine.
what
the
dual
capacity
doctrine
says,
and
we've
cited
a
case
called
american
transportation
in
our
brief
that
deals
with
it,
the
dual
capacity
doctrine
acknowledges
that
utilities
can
sometimes
operate
as
utilities
in
a
tariff
setting,
and
then
other
times
they
can
be
operating
like
other
businesses.
in
this
instance,
it
would
be
a
marketer.
a
good
example
is
precisely
the
facts
of
american
transportation.
that
was
a
situation
where
a
utility...
it
happened
to
be
a
motor
carrier...
decided
to
get
into
the
business
not
just
of
delivering
services,
that
is,
transporting
people
or
goods,
they
decided
also
to
get
into
the
business
of
actually
manufacturing
part
of
the
trucks,
and
they
thought
they
could
do
that
and
still
get
utility
status
with
respect
to
certain
tax
benefits.
they
didn't
get
it,
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
recognized
that
very
doctrine.
there's
a
recent
decision
that
we
relied
on
in
our
brief
called
carnegie,
which
makes
the
precise
same
point.
it
was
decided
less
than
a
year
ago,
and
recognized
that
you
can
operate
in
one
setting
as
a
utility,
and
in
another
not
as
a
utility.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
carnegie
decision,
your
honor,
is
not.
the
american
transportation
decision
is
an
ohio
supreme
court
decision.
the
carnegie
decision
is
a
decision
from
the
ohio
board
of
tax
appeals,
which
is
our
intermediate
tax
court.
it
applies
throughout
the
state.
it
binds
the
tax
commissioner,
the
puc,
and
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
that
is
the
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
the
candid
answer
is
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
the
ohio
courts
are
wrestling
with
that
issue
right
now.
the
dichotomy
they're
trying
to
deal
with
is,
do
you
decide
it's
a
status-based
inquiry,
once
a
utility,
always
a
utility,
or
do
you
look
at
the
activity
and
determine
on
a
case-by-case
basis
whether
they're
acting
as
a
utility?
the
american
transportation
case
seems
to
take
this
case-by-case,
activity-by-activity
approach.
we're
not
saying
carnegie
should
be
good
law,
should
bind
this
court,
should
bind
the
ohio
supreme
court.
the
reason
we're
relying
on
carnegie
is
for
a
very
different
point.
we
rely
on
it
to
show
that
there
are
no
facial
lines
here,
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
yet
to
address
the
question
whether
utilities
actually
are
defined
by
state
boundaries,
so
that
was
part
of
our
alternative
argument,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
that's
not
true,
and
if
i
said
that,
i
misspoke.
every
single--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
mis...
would
it
be,
i
implied,
you
inferred.
the
thing
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
utilities
in
this
instance,
all
of
the
sales,
every
single
sale
at
issue
in
this
case
was
a
tariff
sale.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
that
any
were
nontariff,
and
so
they
simply
can't
rely
on
that
argument.
that's
my
first
point,
that
it's
just--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
the
new
law
does
not
address
that.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
new
law
went
into
effect
a
month
ago.
to
my
understanding,
it
does
not
address
the
question
what
happens
to
a
nontariff
sale,
so
it's
not
simply...
it's
not
been
decided
by
the
general
assembly
of
ohio,
and
it's
not
something
the
ohio
courts
addressed--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
it's
not
entirely
clear.
that
is
not
entirely
clear,
and
that
goes
back
to
the
american
transportation
case.
the
american
transportation
case
was
a
situation
in
which
the
utility
was
acting
as
a
manufacturer,
and
it
was
treated
like
a
manufacturer
in
that
capacity.
my
guess,
my
assumption
is
that
they're
probably
going
to
treat
utilities
across
the
board
as
regulated
entities
when
it
comes
to
tariff
or
nontariff
sales,
but
that's
just
not
been
decided
by
the
record.
in
fact,
in
the
order
they're
citing,
this
1987
order,
the
utility
was
not
even
allowed
to
earn
a
profit
on
the
gas.
it
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
producer,
so
the
nontariff
hypothetical
they're
positing
is
one,
not
only
it
wasn't
presented
there,
i'm
just
not
sure
what
the
precise
facts
are
that
they're
talking
about.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that's
precisely
correct.
there's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely,
which
is
precisely
the
way
the--
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
which
is
precisely
the
way
the
case
has
been
argued,
or
briefed
at
least,
until
now,
the
assumption
being
that
they
all
were
tariff
sales.
ohio's
not
contriving
this
regulatory
distinction
between
utilities
on
the
one
hand
and
all
other
businesses
on
the
other.
it's
been
with
us
for
as
long
as
we've
had
a
dormant
commerce
clause,
and
it's
a
distinction
that
in
one
way
or
another
is
reflected
in
the
statutes
of
every
state
in
the
country,
including
the
district
of
columbia.
what's
going
on
in
this
instance,
and
the
danger
presented
by
this
case,
is
that
you've
got
a
situation
in
which
marketers
have
been
allowed
to
enter
a
natural
gas
business,
they've
been
allowed
to
enter
the
business
in
an
unregulated
capacity,
which
as
they
acknowledge
is
critical
to
this
business
being...
even
being
in
existence.
what
they're
now
trying
to
do
is
reach
over
this
regulatory
wall
and
pick
off
some
of
the
benefits
of
utility
status
without
sharing
in
any
of
those
burdens.
that
simply
just
doesn't
make
sense
as
a
matter
of
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
these
transactions,
however,
simply
aren't
equivalent.
there's
nothing
about
them
that
is
equivalent.
in
one
setting
you
have
prices
that
are
set
by
the
free
market,
what
the
market
will
bear.
the
obligations
that
the
seller
takes
upon
themselves
are
solely
obligations
that
are
a
matter
of
contract.
on
the
other
side
of
the
line,
you
have
a
completely
different
sale.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
the
rates
are
not
set
by
the
seller,
so
they
can't
price-compete.
they
have
a
public
duty
to
the
whole
state,
to
all
consumers.
that
public
duty
requires
them
to
supply
natural
gas
on
demand
at
all
times
in
the
year,
on
the
coldest
day
of
the
winter.
what's
critical
about
that,
and
what
makes
these
two
transactions
so
different,
is
that
utilities,
as
a
result
of
their
public
duty
obligation,
must
enter
into
long-term
contracts
to
make
sure
the
commodity
is
available
on
the
coldest
day
of
the
winter,
and
they
must
also
reserve
space
on
interstate
pipelines
to
make
sure
that
they
can
ship
it
when
they
need
to.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
because
in
that
instance
they
would
be
imposing
those
obligations
upon
themselves
as
a
matter
of
contract,
not
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
they
would
be
able
independently
to
bargain,
both
the
buyer
and
the
seller,
as
to
whether
they
wanted
to
do
that.
but
let
me
add
another
point,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
absolutely...
that's
absolutely
correct.
your
honor,
the
other
problem
that
marketers
are
going
to
have
in
the
situation,
i
think
ultimately
there's
an
end
game
here.
the
suggestion
that
deregulation
that
is
started
at
the
federal
level
is
going
to
inexorably
extend
to
the
state
level,
i
think
is
mistaken.
i
think
there's
a
stopping
point,
and
the
stopping
point
is
that
if
you're
going
to
have
state
utility
laws
like
ohio
does
that
require
utilities...
and
let's
say
they
impose
it
on
marketers
as
well...
to
make
sure
natural
gas
can
be
supplied
year-round,
what
happens
is,
you
end
up
in
a
situation
where
the
marketer
has
to
own
pipeline.
there's
simply
no
way
the
marketer
can
guarantee,
if
he
or
she
does
not
own
pipeline,
that
natural
gas
is
going
to
be
supplied
year-round
on
the
coldest
day
of
the
winter.
that
is
a
business
that
utilities
will
always
control,
utilities
always
will
have
to
control.
that's
something
marketers
can
never
do.
they
can
say
as
a
matter
of
contract
we'll
do
our
best,
but
the
reason
they
can't
guarantee
it
is,
someone
else
owns
the
pipeline,
and
that's
the
public
utility,
so
that's
a
fundamental
distinction.
it's
a
fundamental
distinction
that
will
always
be
there,
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
a
state's
police
power,
it's
properly
always
going
to
be
saying
to
itself,
we've
got
to
have
a
utility
industry.
it
might
be
a
different
utility
industry
than
we
had
20,
30
years
ago,
but
the
reason
we
need
a
utility
industry,
the
reason
we
can't
keep
going
down
this
deregulation
road,
is
people
die
if
they
don't
have
heat
in
winter.
there's
no
elected
official
i
know
of
that's
going
to
let
the
private
market,
in
simply
contracts
between
buyers
and
sellers,
determine
whether
natural
gas
is
delivered
in
cleveland,
ohio,
in
january
of
a
given
year.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
in
the
food
setting,
number
one--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--the
distinction
between
food,
your
honor,
and
natural
gas
is
that
in
one
you've
got
a
natural
monopoly
setting
and
in
the
other
you
do
not.
there's
nothing
about
the
delivery
of
food
that
requires
you
to
lay
pipelines,
telephone
wires,
or
some
other
form
of
distribution
system
to
get
the
good,
the
commodity
from
the
producer
or
wholesaler
to
the
individual
consumer,
so
a
state
would
never
go
down
that
road
because
they
wouldn't
need
to.
what's
unique
about
your
natural
monopolies
is,
it's
a
situation
where
monopolies
are
actually
a
good
thing.
they're
a
good
thing
visually
because
no
one
wants
pipelines
criss-crossing
their
state
more
than
necessary.
they're
a
good
thing
economically
because
they're
much
more
efficient.
it's
much
more
efficient
to
have
one
natural
gas
pipeline,
or
two
or
three
at
the
most,
serving
an
area,
than
it
is
to
have
several.
all
economists
would
agree
with
that.
that's
a
problem,
your
honor,
that
just
doesn't
exist
in
the
food
setting
or
in
other
commodity
settings.
it
just
doesn't
exist.
i'd
like
to
make
another
point.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
our
principle
argument,
justice
ginsburg,
beyond
the
argument
that
they're
differently
situated,
is
that
these
are
actually
transactions
that
can't
be
reconciled.
i
don't
think
the
court
under
the
guise
of
the
commerce
clause
should
be
forcing
states
to
reconcile
what
are
inherently
irreconcilable
transactions.
the
reason
they're
irreconcilable
is
number
1,
because
one
involves
the
sale
of
a
naked
commodity,
the
other
is
a
commodity
in
the
service,
so
they're
just,
to
begin
with,
different
transactions,
different
in
a
way
that
would
be
true
of
other
sales
services
versus
just
a
sale.
the
other
difference
is,
of
course,
the
rate
control
and
the
duty
you
have
to
the
public.
i
don't
know
quite
how...
i
mean,
if
the
court...
let's
just
take
as
an
example,
if
the
court's
decision,
god
forbid,
were
okay,
ohio,
when
it
comes
to
public
utility
sales,
you
now
have
to
put
a
5
to
7-percent
tax
on
all
of
those
sales.
why...
why
is
that
compensating?
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
it's
compensating.
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
there's
any
more
integrity
in
that
system
than
there
is
in
the
current
one,
and
that's
because
the
transactions
and
the
sellers
are
so
very
different.
in
fact,
i
think
this
court's
compensatory
tax
cases
most
recently
fulton,
from
just
last
term,
and
associated
industries
from
three
terms
ago,
stand
for
that
very
point.
in
rejecting...
in
rejecting
the
state's
efforts
to
establish
that
there
was
a
compensatory
tax
which
justified
discrimination,
the
court
was
saying,
in
effect,
we're
not
going
to
look
at
apples
and
oranges
comparisons.
they've
got
to
be
mutually
exclusive
proxies
before
you
can
justify
a
discriminatory
tax.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
there
are
seven
state
statutes
which
are
cited
in
the
kansas
amicus
brief
that
are
precisely
like
ours.
i
should
note
one
of
them
is
from
the
district
of
columbia,
which
of
course
is
something
congress
controls
and
would
create,
i
think,
an
anomaly
here
if
ohio
was
forced
to
make
this
change,
the
district
of
columbia
would
not.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
i'm
sorry,
seven
have
precisely
the
same
system
we
have.
i'm
not
aware
of
the
numbers
that
have,
you
know,
one
form
of
tax
and
another.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
oh,
absolutely.
i
agree
completely.
the
point
i'm
saying
is,
you
have
a
situation
where
a
different
branch
of
government
would
be
compelling
ohio
to
do
something.
it
would
be
a
branch
of
government
that
couldn't
compel
the
district
of
columbia
to
do
it.
i
think
that's
an
anomaly.
in
fact,
dean
milk,
the
1951
case,
suggests
that's
quite
relevant.
what
is
congress
doing
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
an
interstate
commerce
discrimination
setting?
but
justice
kennedy,
i
want
to
come
back
to
your
point,
because
i
think
it's
an
important
one.
there
are...
of
the
states
that
have
taxation
systems
with
respect
to
utilities
and
other
businesses,
31
divide
their
taxation
systems
between
those
entities
that
are
public
utilities
and
those
that
are
other
businesses.
the
problem
with
general
motors'
position
in
this
argument,
and
i
think
this
also
responds
to
something,
justice
ginsburg,
you
were
asking,
is
that
if
you
say
ohio
has
to
endorse
or
adopt
a
sales
tax
that's
precisely
the
same
for
marketers
as
it
is
for
utilities,
then
you're
going
to
have
to
go
down
a
road
which
requires
you
to
examine
the
differential
treatment
in
each
of
these
31
states
for
utilities
on
the
one
hand
and
other
businesses
on
the
other.
i
can
give
you
an
example
of
how
that
plays
out
in
ohio.
in
ohio,
all
businesses
are
required
to
pay
what
is
effectively
an
income
tax.
it's
a
corporate
franchise
tax.
now,
utilities
don't
pay
that
tax.
they've
never
paid
it.
they
pay
lots
of
other
taxes.
in
fact,
they're
a
very
heavily
taxed
entity.
but
if
we
lose
this
case,
the
next
case,
and
it's
one
that
should
be
filed
the
next
day,
would
come
in
and
say,
marketers
should
no
longer
be
forced
to
pay
a
corporate
income
tax,
and
the
reason
is
because
their
competitors,
public
utilities,
do
not.
westinghouse
would
require
that
very
proposition
if
you
adopted
the
view
that
they're
similarly
situated
entities
that
must
be
taxed
and
treated
the
same.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
because
westinghouse
was
a
case
involving
corporate
taxation,
and
i'm
making
the
point
that
this
would
be
a
corporate
taxation
setting.
westinghouse
establishes
that
you
can
have
a
commerce
clause
discrimination
at
the
corporate
level...
in
other
words,
where
sellers
are
being
taxed
differently
at
the
corporate
level
depending
on
whether
they
sell
in-state
or
out-of-state,
so
while
i
don't
want
to
be
arguing
against
myself
if
we
lose,
i'm
just
making
the
point
that
this
would
be
a
problem
that
would
come
down
the
road.
that's
just
the
income
tax.
there
are
other
problems
as
well.
why
is
it
that
utilities,
for
example,
should
get
franchises?
why
should
they
get
exclusive
areas
where
they
alone
sell
a
product
and
no
one
else
does?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
general
motors
is
correct--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--most--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
that,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
utilities
get
a
franchise.
that
franchise
allows
them
to
be
the
distributor
of
all
natural
gas
in
that
area
and,
if
they're
asked,
to
be
the
seller
of
the
gas
and
the
service.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
general
motors
and
its
marketers
would
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
say--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
thought
i
should
have
read
the
briefs
below
in
the
case
before.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
is...
as
i
read
your
decisions
in
the
commerce
clause
area
it's
an
efficiency
inquiry.
i
know
some
of
you
have
disagreed
on
that
point,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
look
at
the
court's
most
aggressive
commerce
clause
cases,
what
i
see
going
on
is
an
efficiency
inquiry.
is
the
state
doing
something
that
is
compelling
an
activity
that
could
be
done
more
efficiently
somewhere
else
within
its
borders?
that's
what
i
see
the
court
saying
in
carbone.
that's
what
i
see
it
saying
in
west
lynn
creamery,
and
certainly
boston
stock
exchange.
i
think
fundamentally
general
motors
is
a
problem
in
that
area.
i
don't
see
the
efficiency
problem
going
on
here.
we
know,
if
you
look
at
the
natural
gas
industry
and
divide
the
different
transactions
that
go
on,
there's
nothing
we're
doing
discriminatory
with
respect
to
solicitation.
that
can
be
done
by
utilities
and
marketers
anywhere,
in-state,
out-of-state.
we're
not
doing
anything
with
respect
to
where
the
gas
originates.
is
it
from
ohio?
is
it
from
texas?
there's
nothing
there.
what
we're
doing
that's
discriminatory,
we're
told,
is
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
distribution.
the
problem
with
that
efficiency
argument
is,
there's
absolutely
no
way
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
and
economics
to
have
a
more
efficient
distribution
system
of
natural
gas
in
a
state
other
than
ohio.
that
can't
be
done.
in
ohio,
an
elected
official
that
said
we
ought
to
ensure
that
the
distribution
lines
are
working
properly
in
indiana
would
be
laughed
out
of
office.
there's
an
inherent
nature
to
utility
sales
that
they
have
to
be
in-state.
there's
nothing
wrong
about
that,
and
as
long
as
ohio
is
not
saying
as
a
precondition
to
being--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
mean,
actually
ohio
would
allow
an
indiana
utility
to
come
into
ohio.
what
ohio
would
say
is
that
if
you're
going
to
take
on
an
obligation
to
supply
natural
gas
year-round
to
every
corner
of
the
state,
you've
got
to
own
pipelines
here,
and
that's
the
problem.
you
can't--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
but
i
will
say
this,
and
it's
reflected
in
the
amicus
brief
of
columbia
gas,
columbia
gas
is
a
great
example
of
a
national
utility.
they
have
utility
operations
i
think
in
at
least
four
states,
including
ohio.
there's
nothing
about
ohio
law
that
says
an
ohio...
an
hawaii-owned
utility
can't
buy
transportation
lines
and
take
on
the
obligations
of
an
ohio
utility.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
the
point
i'm
making
is--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--right.
your
honor,
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
carnegie
helps
us.
the
reason
carnegie
helps
us
is
because
that's
a
setting,
or
that's
a
case
that
suggests
of
a
utility
transaction
took
place
outside
of
ohio...
in
other
words,
we're
not
dealing
what
the
chief...
mr.
chief
justice
was
just
asking
about.
the
utility
transaction
actually
takes
place
in
indiana
alone.
carnegie
suggests
you
would
still
get
the
use
tax
exemption.
the
reason
we're
relying
on
carnegie...
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
it's
for
a
very
narrow
ground
for
this
decision.
the
reason
we
rely
on
carnegie
is,
it
shows
that
ohio
treats,
or
at
least
potentially
treats
utilities
the
same
whether
they
own
transportation
equipment
in
ohio
or
outside
of
ohio.
we're
trying
to...
we're
taking
on
the
facial
absolutism
component
of
general
motors'
argument,
the
notion
that
you
own...
you
set
a
requirement
that
you
own
transportation
equipment
in
the
state,
and
because
you
do
that
that's
a
facial
line,
it
discriminates
against
other
entities,
you
lose.
we're
saying,
that's
not
true.
we
can
even
respond
to
the
facial
absolutism
argument.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
that's
precisely
the
quandary
that
carnegie
suggests,
and
here's
why
that's
true,
your
honor.
you
get
the
benefit
of
the
use
tax
exemption
if
it
would
be
a
transaction
that
would
be
exempt
had
it
been
a
sale
in
the
state,
okay.
if
we
have
an
indiana
transaction,
what
happens
is
the
indiana
utility
sells
to
general
motors
or
pipeline,
uses
its
transportation
equipment,
it
winds
up
in
ohio,
there's
an
argument...
it's
an
argument
that
there's
a
use
tax
applicable.
that
is
not
our
preferred
ground.
in
fact,
i
think
it
would
be
dangerous
for
the
court
to
issue
an
opinion
that
suggests
that
in
1996
or
1997
that
the
only
way
utilities
in
this
country...
and
it's
just
not
natural
gas
utilities,
it's
all
utilities...
the
only
way
they
can
be
constitutional
is
if
you
don't
have
a
requirement
that
they
own
transportation
equipment
in
the
state.
i
think
that's
an
odd
rule,
and
that's
why
our
fundamental
argument
is
that
they're
differently
situated
entities,
and
even
if
ohio
law
does
require
you
to
own
the
transportation
equipment
within
the
state
boundaries,
it's
still
constitutionally
permissible
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
i
think
in
this
instance
they'd
have
difficulty
doing
that,
because
the
transactions
occurred
out
of
state,
so
that
they
simply
couldn't
do
that.
but
to
answer
your
question
with
respect
to
what
happened
if
it
were
in-state,
and
that
happens
here,
some
of
these
transactions
were
by
in-state
marketers,
absolutely.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--oh,
your
honor,
that's
precisely...
it's
ironic
why
we're
here.
the
reason
we're
here
is
because
back
in
1982
some
marketers
came
to
ohio
and
said,
listen,
we'd
like
to
sell
natural
gas,
but
we'd
like
to
do
it
in
a
deregulated
capacity,
and
ohio
at
that
point
had
the
choice
to
say,
no.
you're
a
utility,
or
you're
not
a
utility,
and
we
could
still
do
that
under
the
natural
gas
act.
but
ohio
chose
not
to,
and
what
ohio
chose
to
do
was
to
say,
well,
we
think
deregulated
gas
is
a
good
thing.
it's
particularly
good
for
industrial
consumers.
we're
just...
the
only
thing
we're
going
to
condition
it
on
is
that
there's
a
regulatory
line,
and
if
you're
on
the
deregulated
side
you
get
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
it,
if
you're
on
the
regulated
side
you
get
the
benefits
and
burdens
as
well,
but
you
can't
pick
and
choose.
once
you're
one
you
have
to
comply
with
all
of
those
rules
and
all
of
those
laws.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
oh,
yes,
absolutely.
absolutely.
they
of
course
would
ultimately
probably
have
to
get
transportation
equipment
as
well,
right.
this
gets
back
to
the
point
we
were
talking
about
earlier,
that
ohio...
the
ohio
public
utilities
commission,
it's
elected
officials,
can't
be
certain
that
a
company
will
be
able
to
provide
natural
gas
whenever
it
is
needed,
however
cold,
unless
that
company
owns
transportation
equipment,
so
i
think
fundamentally...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
of
an
ohio
opinion
that
says
that,
but
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
they
probably
would
end
up
saying
that
very
point.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
we're
not,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
very
briefly
address
the
congressional
authority
argument
that
we
have
also
raised.
let
me
tell
you
why
it's
a
difficult
argument,
but
why
i
think
we
can
still
make
it.
it's
a
difficult
argument
because
back
in
1938
when
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed,
and
again
when
it
was
amended
in
1953,
i
don't
think
it
was
in
any
congressman
or-woman's
mind
that
they
needed
to
pass
this
law
to
constitutionalize
the
status
of
utilities,
so
that's
a
problem
i
had.
it
simply
just
wasn't
something
they
were
after.
they
were
trying
to
fill
a
regulatory
void
with
respect
to
interstate
transportation
of
gas.
but
that
said,
the
language
does
the
trick.
the
language
indicates
that
there's
a
dichotomy
between
all
retail
sales
on
the
one
hand
and
all
wholesale
sales
on
the
other.
in
this
instance,
that's
all
we
have.
all
we
have
are
retail
transactions,
and
under
section
1(b)
and
(c)
of
the
act,
which
is
codified
at
15
u.s.c.
717b
and
c,
that's
precisely
what
ohio's
allowed
to
do.
now,
general
motors
has
argued
that's
not
true.
the
enabling
language
simply
gives
you
authority
to
regulate
rates,
services.
it
doesn't
use
the
magic
words,
tax.
we
don't
think
congress
had
to
use
the
magic
words,
tax,
in
order
to
bless
this
form
of
transaction,
and
the
reason
is
straightforward.
number
1,
the
text
of
the
commerce
clause
itself,
of
course,
uses
the
word
regulate.
it
says
nothing
about
tax,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
the
word
regulate
in
the
constitution
didn't
cover
discriminatory
taxes,
so
that's
a
starting
point.
a
second
point
is
a
matter
of
common
sense.
as
this
court
has
indicated,
is
the
word
regulate
does
cover
tax.
indeed,
in
general
motors'
own
opening
brief
at
page
28,
and
again
in
one
of
their
amicus
briefs,
at
page
13
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief,
they
made
that
very
point.
the
chamber
of
commerce
said,
what's
going
on
here
is
ohio
is
using
taxes
as
a
back-door
way
to
regulate
marketers,
so
i
think
as
a
matter
of
common
understanding,
everyone
understands
the
broad
term
regulate
to
cover
taxes.
there's
another
reason
why
this
is
legitimate,
under
congressional
blessing,
and
that's
the
fact
that
what
ohio
has
done
to
all
of
the
marketers...
and
i
think
this
is
important
for
the
commerce
clause
issue
as
well.
what
ohio
has
done
is
treated
the
marketers
like
all
other
businesses.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
your
honor.
