justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
case
that
we
look
to
of
congressional
policy
in
determining
whether
or
not
there's
a
violation
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
some
of
the
rubbish
cases,
or...
i
can't
think
of
a
commerce
clause
case
where
we
specifically
really
rely
on
the
congressional
policy.
