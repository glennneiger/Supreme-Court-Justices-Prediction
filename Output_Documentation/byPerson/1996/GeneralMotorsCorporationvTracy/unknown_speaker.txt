unknown
speaker
when
you
say
discriminate,
mr.
dyk,
you
suggest
that
these
two
entities
should
be
treated
as
equals.
unknown
speaker
that
there
aren't
really
any
factors
that
distinguish
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
isn't
it
a
public
utility
that
we're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
very
concerned
about
your
theory,
frankly,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
your
theory
would
really
eviscerate
public
regulation
of
public
utilities.
unknown
speaker
but
i
assume
that
the
overall
rate
the
utility
can
earn
is
limited
by
regulation.
unknown
speaker
was
this
a
new
statute,
mr.
dyk,
or
was...
the
statutory
permission
for
the
utilities
to
do
unregulated
sales,
was
that
statute
in
effect
during
the
tax
period
here
in
question?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
unregulated
sales
were
subject
to
the
sales
tax
so
that
there
would
be
equivalence
between
the
utility's
unregulated
sales
and
the
interstate
sales,
would
your
case
then
go
away,
or
would
you
still
argue
that
there's
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
theory
is
that
there's
still
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
but
public
utilities
have
a
number
of
other
burdens
on
them,
do
they
not,
particularly
serving
retail
customers.
they
may
have
to
provide
gas
to
people
who
can't
pay
the
bill,
or
supply
a
certain
amount
of
heat
during
the
winter.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
have
to
look
at
their
entire
business,
and
not
just
the
part
that
you
single
out?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
when
you
say
that
these
nontariff
sales
are
not
part
of
its
regular
business,
is
it
also
the
case
that
for
purposes
of
determining
what
their
allowable
rate
of
return
will
be,
the
profits
they
make
from
these
sales
are
not
considered,
it's
just
the
separate...
they
can
make
as
much
money
as
they
want
from
these
nonregulated
sales,
and
it
will
not
be
considered
in
fixing
their
tariffs
for
the
next
year.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
dyk,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
that
score?
you've
indicated
that
the
same
intrastate
pipelines
are
used
by
both
the
independent
seller
and
the
public
utility,
and
are
those
pipelines
owned
by
the
public
utility?
unknown
speaker
and
how
do
they
determine
the
charge
for
the
gas
sold
that's
delivered
through
those
pipelines
in
the
independent
marketer
sales?
unknown
speaker
and
those
are...
they're
charged
separately,
but
are
they
controlled
by
the
state
public
utility
commission?
unknown
speaker
if
they're
individually
negotiated,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
market
would
take
care
of
the
disparity
between
the
taxed
and
the
no-tax
sellers.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
is
it
clear
that
for
what
you
call
the
unregulated
sales
both
before
it
was
formalized
in
the
law
and
under
the
new
law,
that
those
unregulated
sales
also
escaped
the
sales
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't...
could
ohio
say,
because
the
public
utility
has
obligations
that
the
state
imposes
on
it,
and
because
the
regulated
sales
have
bundled
together
these
other
aspects,
while
there
won't
be
an
escape
from
the
sales
tax
entirely,
there
will
be
an
allocation,
so
that
only
the
part
that's
attributable
to
the
commodity
is
subject
to
the
sales
tax
and
not
the
part
that's
attributable
to
these
other
items?
unknown
speaker
even
with
respect
to
the
gas,
the
obligation
that
you
must
have
enough
supply
to
serve
everybody
at
all
times,
could
that
be
factored
out
so
that
you
could
make
the
gas
sale
of
the
regulated
company
similar
to
the
unregulated
sale?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
suggested
that
if
there
were
an
exemption
for
residential
customers,
no
sales
tax,
that
would
be
all
right,
but
you're
recognizing
that
there
can
be
some
recognition
by
the
state
that
it
is
imposing,
that
this
is
a
regulated
industry.
what
else
could
the
state
do
to
take
into
account
the
obligations
that
the
regulated
utility
is
under?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
an
apportioned
gross
receipts
tax
would
be
constitutional,
and
if
everybody
paid
their
gross
receipts
tax
then
your
client's
suppliers
would
pay
an
apportioned
gross
receipts
tax.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me,
getting
back
to
the
unregulated
sales
that
the
utilities
make,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
gives
us
an
idea
of
the
significance,
the
percentage
of
sales
that
were...
the
utility
made
that
were
unregulated
sales
during
the
tax
period
in
question?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure,
in
light
of
what
you
said
about,
that
even
the
residential
sales
are
being
deregulated.
you
responded
to
me,
to
my
question,
what
could
the
state
do
to
recognize
that
this
is
a
public
utility?
you
said,
it
could
exempt
sales
to
residential
users,
and
you
stand
by
that?
unknown
speaker
right
now,
there
isn't
that
choice,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second?
in
response
to
justice
kennedy,
you
said
that
the
record
indicated
that
about
20
percent
of
the
utility
sales
were
industrial
sales,
but
you
don't
know
how
much
of
those
were
un...
pursuant
to
volume
discount
tariffs,
and
how
much
were
unregulated.
assume
they
were
all
pursuant
to
volume
discount
tariffs.
would
you
win
or
lose
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
without
the
power
to
set
its
own
prices.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
the
question
a
little
differently.
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
how
much
the
20
percent
is
unregulated
and
how
much
isn't,
and
i
suppose
you
have
the
burden
of
establishing
unconstitutionally
generally,
and
if
the
amount
of
unregulated
sales
are
critical
to
your
case,
i
suppose
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
us
how
many
they
were,
so
is
it
correct
that
we
should
decide
the
case
on
the
hypothesis
that
all
of
those
20
percent
were
actually
regulated?
unknown
speaker
would
the
whole
tax
be
invalid,
or
only
the
tax
as
applied
to
those
sales,
assuming
that
the
tax
as
applied
to
other
sales
by
the
utility
is
okay?
why
would
we
strike
down
even
the
sales
that
were
pursuant
to
volume
discounts?
unknown
speaker
tariff
volume
discounts?
unknown
speaker
just
what
does
the
record
show
about,
not
the
volume
of
discount
sales,
but
the
unregulated
sales
of
the
utility?
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
is,
even
if
only
1
percent
of
the
20
percent
was
this
kind
of
sale,
your
client
is
exempt
from
paying
the
sales
tax,
the
use
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
i
take
it
your
view,
even
if
zero
percent
is
unregulated,
it's
unconstitutional.
the
discrimination
exists.
unknown
speaker
how
can
an
amicus
brief
confirm
a
factual
question?
i
mean,
i
can
imagine
the
record
might.
unknown
speaker
but
how
can
an
amicus
brief
do
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
isn't
bound...
the
state
may...
the
respondent
may
be
bound
by
its
statements
in
its
own
brief,
but
certainly
it's
not
bound
by
statements
in
some
amicus
brief,
even
though
the
amicus
is
in
support
of
the
respondent.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
who
was
the
witness
who
was
testifying
at
229
and
230?
is
he
your
witness,
or
the
state's
witness?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
mr.
duffy.
unknown
speaker
he
would
like
to
have
testified.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
you
would
be
making
the
argument
that
you're
making
even
if
every
sale
by
the
public
utility
was
regulated.
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
spell
out
what
that
argument
is?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
to
do
that
under
this
market
is
really
to
adopt
by
subterfuge
a
compensatory
tax
justification,
i
take
it,
then.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
dyk.
mr.
sutton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
have
to
take
this
case
on
the
basis
that
we
assume
they
were
tariff-regulated
sales?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
decision
that
said
an
out-of-state
public
utility
regulated
by
some
other
state
but
not
ohio
remains
a
public
utility
even
though
it's
acting
as
a
marketer
in
ohio?
unknown
speaker
and
is...
are
you
adhering
to
that
decision?
are
you
adopting
that
decision
as
part
of
your
position,
that
once
a
public
utility
always
a
public
utility,
whether
in
indiana,
pennsylvania,
ohio--
unknown
speaker
--well,
to
the
extent
the
case
is
as
you
first
described
it,
it's...
and
i
was
listening
to
it.
it
seemed
to
me
to
help
mr.
dyk's
position
more
than
yours,
i.e.,
that
this
is
not
a
utility
for
some
purposes,
and
therefore
it
should
be
comparable
to
the
out-of-state
suppliers
that
sell
to
gm.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
say
that.
it
was
just
the
inference
i
was
drawing,
and
maybe
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
may
be
the
next
case,
but
can
you
tell
me
under
the
new
law,
are
the
unregulated
sales
exempt
from
sales
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
either
they're...
they
have
an
exemption
under
current
law.
does
that
exemption
apply
to
the
unregulated
sales?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
until
that
law
of
a
month
or
so
ago,
during
the
period
developed
in
this
lawsuit,
if
the
utility
made
unregulated
sales,
they
were
exempt
from
tax.
that's
clear,
i
think,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
if
they
made
any.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
did
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case
on
your
assumption,
or
would
you
be
content
with
a
narrow
decision
that
says,
at
least
since
we
don't
know
in
this
case
that
any
nontariff
sales
are
exempted
from
the
tax,
it's
certainly
okay
to
exempt
tariff
sales
from
the
tax,
it's
certainly
okay
to
exempt
tariff
sales
from
the
tax,
and
that's
all
we
have
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
you'll...
what's
correct,
that
you'll
take
the
latter?
unknown
speaker
take
the
latter
and
run.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
just
saying,
you
know,
we
don't
want
all
the
benefits.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
benefits
you
can
give
to
utilities.
all
they're
saying
is,
there's
one
particular
benefit
you
can't
give
to
utilities,
and
that
is,
in
transactions
that
are
equivalent,
giving
them
a
commercial
advantage
by
reason
of
your
tax.
i
mean,
you
can
help
these
utilities
a
lot
of
different
ways.
you
don't
have
to
do
it
this
way.
unknown
speaker
you're
assuming
all
tariff...
all
these
sales
were
tariff
sales.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
have
a
long-term
contract
by
the
independent
marketer
who...
that
contains
all
those
provisions,
we'll
deliver
gas
when
it's
cold,
and
we'll
guarantee
that
it
will
be
there
and
the
pipe
will
be.
why
then
are
they
different?
unknown
speaker
but
the
other
thing
that's
puzzling
about
it,
the
whole
rationale
for
regulating
the
prices
of
the
utilities
are
to
prevent
them
from
charging
too
much.
unknown
speaker
we
do
it
for
food.
unknown
speaker
it's
no
less
essential,
and
we
don't
feel
the
need
to
have
the
government
take
over
bread
distribution.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
what
about
mr.
dyk's
argument
that
of
course
you
can
recognize
that
these
are
public
utilities,
but
not
by
the
sales
tax
exemption
so
long
as
you're
imposing
a
compensating
use
tax.
you
can
adjust
the
gross
receipts
tax,
you
can
exempt
residential
sales.
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
unknown
speaker
do
most
states
or
almost
all
states
decline
to
impose
sales
tax
on
gas
or
electricity
sold
through
a
utility?
unknown
speaker
do
other
states...
you
say
seven
don't.
does
that
mean
that--
unknown
speaker
--you
think
congress
controls
the
district
of
columbia
more
than
it
controls
ohio?
i
mean,
the
only
point
is,
congress
could
change
it
in
the
district
of
columbia.
it
certainly
could
change
it
in
ohio
if
it
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
figure
westinghouse?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
most
of
those
situations
they
don't
have
competitors.
unknown
speaker
this
is
an
usual
case,
because
a
public
utility
has
a
competitor
for
a
significant
part
of
its
business,
but
in
most
public
utility
regulation
there's...
it's
a
natural
monopoly
and
there's
no
competitor
to
be
concerned
about.
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
could
get
congress
to
pass
a
must-carry
provision.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
to
say
there's
an
inherent
nature
that
they
have
to
be
in-state,
the
reason
they
have
to
be
in-state
generally
is
because
of
a
legal
provision.
it's
that
indiana
won't
allow
an
ohio
public
utility
to
come
into
indiana,
and
vice
versa.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any...
are
there
any
indiana
utilities
which
presently
serve
retail
customers
in
ohio?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
the
case
for
the
indiana
utility,
the
chief
justice's...
if
that
indiana
utility
did
provide
services
in
ohio,
it
would
become
an
ohio
utility
as
well,
right?
unknown
speaker
now
we
still
have
in
limbo,
mr.
sutton,
that
carnegie
you
sort
of
cite,
and
you
say,
i
want
to
use
it
whichever
way
i
can
use
it,
but
that
seems
to
be
at
least
one
tribunal
in
ohio
saying,
if
you
are
a
public
utility
any
place,
we'll
treat
you
as
a
public
utility
here,
even
though
you're
acting
as
a
marketer
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
can't
be
exempted
from
the
sales
tax
as
a
utility
unless
you
own
pipes,
pipeline
in
ohio,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
just
supposing,
if
ohio
wanted
to,
could
it
impose
on
the
competitor,
the
independent
marketer
that
sells
to
general
motors,
an
obligation
to
sell
only
at
the
same
price
that
the
utility
can
charge?
unknown
speaker
and
also,
i
suppose,
could
require
them
to
supply
their
customers
in
the
winter
even
if
they
don't
pay
their
bills.
unknown
speaker
if
they
were
compelled
to
comply
with
the
rules,
then
of
course
they
could
not...
they
would
also
get
the
tax
exemption,
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
just
to
clear
out
one
thing,
you're
not
arguing
standing
any
more
at
this--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
sutton.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
