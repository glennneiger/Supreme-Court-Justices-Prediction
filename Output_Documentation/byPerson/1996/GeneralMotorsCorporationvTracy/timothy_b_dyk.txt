mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
question
whether
the
state
of
ohio
can
discriminate
against
interstate
transactions
in
the
application
of
its
sales
and
use
tax
of
natural
gas
purchases.
if
the
purchaser
in
ohio,
such
as
general
motors
in
this
case,
purchases
from
a
local
public
utility
which
supplies
the
gas
through
its
own
distribution
lines,
the
sale
or
use
is
exempt.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
gas
is
supplied
by
an
interstate
marketer
of
natural
gas
which
has
no
distribution
lines
within
the
state,
the
purchase
is
not
exempt,
and
this
is--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--there
are
no
factors
that
distinguish
them
in
our
view,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
the
same
gas
that
can
come
from
the
same
well,
distributed
over
the
same
interstate
pipeline,
distributed
through
the
same
local
pipeline,
and
the
local
natural
gas
company
may
or
may
not
be
selling
tariff
gas.
in
other
words,
it
may
be--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
o'connor,
it
is
a
public
utility,
but
the
sales
by
the
public
utility
are
not
regulated
sales.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
what
we
have
here
is
our
local
public
utilities,
which
are
making
to
a
very
significant
extent
nontariff
sales.
that's
admitted
at
the
very
outset
of
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
1
and
2.
it's
reflected
in
the
record,
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
229
and
230.
as
a
result
of
local
deregulation,
natural
gas
public
utilities
in
ohio,
and
this
is
true
in
other
states
as
well,
are
permitted
to
engage
in
the
business
of
gas
marketing.
in
other
words,
they're
largely
unregulated.
all
they
had
to
do
during
the
period
in
question
was
to
file
the
contract
with
the
public
utility
commission.
they
in
fact
were
allowed
to
do
this,
to
engage
in
these
unregulated
sales,
because
they
faced
competition
from
these
interstate
marketers,
and
the
public
utilities--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--not
in
these
sales,
justice
o'connor.
these
sales
are
unregulated
sales.
there
is
no
tariff
for
them.
the
price
at
which
the
gas
is
sold
is
not
regulated.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
was
to
allow
these
local
public
utilities
to
compete
with
the
interstate
marketers
so
they
wouldn't
have
to
sell
pursuant
to
a
tariff,
so
that
they
could
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
competition,
the
same
kind
of
discounting,
the
same
kind
of
individual
pricing
that
the
out-of-state
marketers--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--it
wasn't
a
statute
during
the
tax
period
in
question.
what
you
had
was
permission
from
the
ohio
public
service
commission
to
engage
in
these
kinds
of
sales,
and
there
was
a
19...
october
1987
order,
for
example,
with
respect
to
east
ohio
gas,
which
i'll
lodge
with
the
court.
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
it
is
a
public
order
of
the
commission
which
said
yes,
you
can
engage
in
these
kinds
of
sales,
and
these
went
on
for
a
number
of
years.
this
is
reflected,
as
i
said,
in
the
record
at
229
to
230.
then
last
june,
this
was
formalized
by
statute
for
the
first
time,
and
the
ohio
legislature
said,
you
don't
even
have
to
bother
to
file
these
arrangements,
these
marketing
arrangements,
with
the
public
utilities
commission,
you
just
go
ahead
and
do
it,
and
go
on
your
merry
way.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
still...
i
would--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
think
that...
that
is
not
this
case,
but
there
is
still
discrimination
involved,
because
the
public
utilities
are
allowed,
under
an
ohio
law,
to
file
volume
discount
tariffs
and
things
of
that
sort
which
allow
them
to
compete
even
under
the
tariffs,
and
this
october
1987
order
of
the
public
utilities
commission
which
i
mentioned
shows
on
its
face
that
northeast
gas
in
that
particular
case
was
able
to
compete
and
actually
offer
a
lower
price
pursuant
to
these
tariffs.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
they
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
they
also
engage
in
this
unregulated
business,
and
the
fact
that
they
are
a
favored
local
industry,
that
the
state
wishes
to
protect
theme,
has
not
in
this
court's
other
commerce
clause
cases
been
a
sufficient
basis
for
discrimination.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
for
example,
in
the
armco
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
of
columbia
gas,
they
had
a
situation
where
there
was
a
discrimination
against
out-of-state
wholesalers,
and
the
theory
was,
well,
we
can
treat
in-state
manufacturers/wholesalers
differently,
and
the
fact
that
you
may
combine
competitive
interstate
business
with
some
sort
of
local
business
doesn't
justify
discrimination
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
i
understand
the
court
in
that
case
to
have
directly
addressed
that
question
and
to
resolve
it
in
favor
of
invalidating
the
discrimination.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
my
understanding,
justice
scalia--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--and
the
purpose
of
this
is,
what
you
have
as
a
result
of
federal
deregulation
is
you
have
a
lot
of
competition
in
the
natural
gas
market.
anybody
can
sell
gas,
transport
it
over
interstate
pipelines,
and
the
same
kind
of
deregulation
has
taken
place
at
the
state
level.
you
can
take
the
gas
over
the
local
public
utility
lines
and
sell
it.
anybody
can
go
into
that
business.
and
as
a
result
of
this
competition,
what
happened
was
that
the
local
public
utilities
were
suffering.
people
were
going
to
these
interstate
marketers,
and
the
local
public
utilities
commissions
wanted
to
find
some
way
of
enabling
these
companies
to
compete
with
these
new
marketers,
and
the
way
they
figured
out
to
allow
them
to
compete
in
many
instances
was
to
say,
okay,
we'll
allow
you,
too,
to
make
unregulated
sales
and
to
act
as
marketers,
and
to
compete
with
these
interstate
businesses
so
you
don't
lose
the
in-state
business.
now,
there's
a
very
important
reason
for
that,
of
course.
they
wanted
them
to
earn
additional
money
to
increase
their
profitability,
but
that
did
not
come
into
account
in
fixing
the
rates
pursuant
to
the
tariffs
for
natural
gas--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--they're
owned
by
the
public
utility,
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
what
you
have
is
both
open
access...
that
is,
people
who
are
not
in
the
public
utility
business
have
the
right
to
use
those
transportation
facilities...
and
so-called
unbundling,
which
was
a
concept
that
originated
at
the
federal
level
but
also
exists
at
the
state
level,
in
which
there
are
separate
statements
for
transportation
charges
and
the
transportation
charges
have
to
be...
has
to
be...
have
to
be
justified.
of
course,
the
public
utilities
really
remain
as
public
utilities
when
they're
supplying
the
transportation
service,
but
that's
unbundled.
it's
charged
separately,
and
the
rates
are
calculated
separately.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
transportation
rates
are
still
controlled
by
the
state
public
utility
commission,
though
in
some
instances
even
those
transportation
rates
are
now
being
individually
negotiated.
but
by
and
large
those
are
pursuant
to
tariffs
set
by
the
public
utility--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
stevens,
i'm
not
under...
i'm
not
sure
why
i
understand
the
market
would
take
care
of
that.
what
you
have
is
the
charges
for
the
gas
are
stated
separately,
and
if
the
public
utility
has
an
advantage,
there's
no
5
to
7-percent
use
tax
on
the
purchases
from
them,
they
have
an
advantage
over
the
interstate
seller,
who
must
sell
to
a
purchaser,
and
the
tax
is
on
the
purchaser,
the
purchaser
has
to
pay
this
5
to
7-percent
tax,
and
in
a
business
like
this,
which
is
highly
competitive,
5
to
7-percent
can
be
a
significant
amount
of
money
and
a
significant
advantage.
now,
what
the
state
says
is,
oh
well,
we
impose
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
public
utilities.
the
problem
is
that
the
gross
receipts
tax
doesn't
satisfy
this
court's
standards
for
a
compensatory
tax.
it's
not
imposed
on
a
substantially
equivalent
event.
it's
not
even
imposed
on
the
same
people.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
because
the
natural
gas
company
is
still
a
supplier
of
natural
gas.
it
is
still
a
natural
gas
company
which
is
supplying
the
gas
over
its
own
distribution
lines
within
the
state,
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
there
is
no
sales
or
use
tax
on
the
transportation.
there's
only
a
sales
or
use
tax
now
on
the
gas
purchase,
so
what
you
have
is
a
discriminatory
situation,
and
these
public
utilities
have
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
act
as
gas
marketers.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
many
ways
that
the
state
could
achieve
its
interest
here
without
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce,
as
you
suggest.
for
example,
if
there
is
concern,
and
that's
expressed
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
support
of
the
respondent,
if
there's
concern
that
residential
customers
shouldn't
have
to
pay
the
sales
or
use
tax
on
gas
purchases,
it's
a
simple
matter
to
just
exempt
residential
customers
from
the
sales
or
use
tax.
it's
very
easy
to
construct
a
system
that
treats
equally
purchasers
from
interstate
companies
and
purchasers
from
local
public
utilities.
it's
not
hard
at
all,
and
there's
no
justification
for
the
state
framing
it
the
way
it
does
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
i
should
add
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
obviously
they
could
reduce
the
gross
receipts
tax,
which
appears
to
be
what
they've
done
in
this
new
legislation
of
last
june
in
house
bill
476.
they
don't
have
to
impose
this
kind
of
gross
receipts
tax
on
public
utilities,
but
what
they
can't
do
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
to
say,
we're
going
to
have
two
identical
purchases
here.
on
one
of
them
we're
going
to
have
a
use
tax;
on
the
other
one
we're
not
going
to
have
a
use
tax.
there's
a
rule
of
strict
equality
here,
and
it
makes
particular
sense
in
the
context
of
this
very
highly
competitive
natural
gas
market,
and
this
is
not
only
true
with
respect
to
industrial
purchasers,
and
industrial
purchasers
are
the
ones
who
suffered
during
the
period
we're
involved
in
here,
but
it's
going
to
happen
in
the
residential
market
also.
these...
there
are
tariffs
being
filed
in
ohio
and
elsewhere,
and
i
think
this
is
again
recognized
in
the
columbia
gas
brief,
that
will
allow
competition
at
the
residential
level.
the
whole
industry
is
changing
dramatically
as
a
result
of
congressional
policy,
reflected
in
the
1978
and
1989
statutes
and
the
implementing
ferc
regulations.
there's
going
to
be
competition
at
the
residential
level
for
gas
sales
between
the
public
utilities
and
between
the
out-of-state
marketers.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
it
would
be
constitutional
to
have
an
apportioned
gross
receipts
tax,
except
for
the
fact
that
you
probably
can't
reach
out-of-state
sellers
with
a
gross
receipts
tax
because
of
public
law
86-272,
so
the
state
would
probably
choose
to
approach
it
by
having
a
use
tax
imposed
on
all
people
and
to
remit...
as
they
apparently
are
seeking
to
do
in
the
new
legislation
remit
the
gross
receipts
tax
so
it
doesn't
bear
so
heavily
on
the
public
utilities.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
there's
no
statistic
for
that.
what
i
think
the
record
reflects
is
that
about
20
percent
of
the
industrial
sales
continued
to
be
made
by
public
utilities
during
the
period,
but
there's
no
breakdown
as
to
what
part
of
that
20
percent
is
unregulated
sales
and
what
part
might
be
pursuant
to
volume
discount
tariffs
or
other
things
of
that
sort.
now,
what...
the
state--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i...
sure.
of
course
they
could
exempt
sales
to
residential
users,
as
long
as
a
residential
user
who
chooses
to
purchase
from
the
out-of-state
marketer
as
opposed
to
the
in-state
public
utility
is
treated
the
same
way.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
in
some
places
there
is,
but
by
and
large
there
isn't.
it's
a
coming
phenomenon.
it
hasn't
really
arrived
in
substantial
degree
yet.
what
ohio
supreme
court
said
here
is,
well,
we
don't
have
any
problem
here,
because
this
excise
tax
to
be
sure
is
not
imposed
on
the
local
public
utilities,
but
it
is
imposed
on
local
gas
marketers
who
are
not
public
utilities
under
this
court's
precedents
for
over
100
years,
ranging
from
the
brimmer
case
way
back
when
up
to
this
court's
decision
in
carbone.
the
fact
that
some
local
people
may
be
disadvantaged
is
no
excuse
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
now...
and
this
is
not
an
argument
that
it
made
below
and
not
an
argument
that
was
adopted
by
the
ohio
supreme
court...
it
is
saying,
well,
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
has
blessed
this
discrimination
that
we
have
made
in
amendments
to
the
natural
gas
act
that
were
passed
in
the
early
1950's,
which
allowed
the
state
public
utilities
commissions
to
continue
to
regulate
the
interstate
gas
market
and
effectively
overruled
this
court's
decision
in
east
ohio.
and
we've
shown
in
our
brief,
i
think,
that
these
1950
amendments
had
nothing
to
do
with
permitting
discriminatory
taxation
by
the
states.
even
this
court's
decision
in
east
ohio
recognized
that
the
tax
doctrines
really
didn't
have
much
to
do
with
this
and
it
was
addressing
itself
only
to
regulatory
issues.
but
i
think
the
most
significant
thing
is
not
that
congress
in
the
fifties
authorized
this
kind
of
discrimination,
but
that
congress
in
the
seventies
and
1980's
has
taken
a
very
strong
position
that
it
wishes
to
have
a
competitive
natural
gas
market,
that
it
has
taken
actions
again
and
again
and
again
to
create
a
competitive
natural
gas
market
in
this
country,
and
it
has
recognized
that
natural
gas
is
a
commodity
which
should
be
treated
separate
from
transportation...
in
other
words,
this
is
the
unbundling
aspect
of
it...
and
it
has
said
that
it
wants
all
the
competitors
who
were
selling
natural
gas
to
have
an
equal
opportunity,
and
if
there's
any
federal
policy
here,
we
respectfully
suggest,
it
is
a
federal
policy
that
everybody
should
be
treated
the
same
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
we
would
still
win,
because
i
think
whether
the
public
utility
sales
are
made
pursuant
to
tariffs
or
are
unregulated,
that
in
either
event
the
public
utility
is
a
competitor
with
the
out-of-state
marketer,
and
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
it
has
the
power
to
set
its
own
prices
in
the
sense
that
it
can
propose
tariffs,
some
of
which
may
be
marginal
cost
tariffs
rather
than
fully
allocated
tariffs.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
oh,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
do
that,
justice
stevens.
i
think
this
court
has
made
clear
in
a
lot
of
cases
that
if
there
is
even
a
small
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce;
and
if
you
look
at
the
unregulated
sales
as
being
the
only
significant
ones,
which
we
don't,
there
were
still
some
of
them,
and
for
example,
in
associated
industries
and
bacchus
the
court
has
said,
well,
even
if
the
favored
sales
are
very
small
in
volume,
and
maybe
wouldn't
be
considered
economically
significant,
there's
no
de
minimis
doctrine
under
the
commerce
clause.
it's
still
invalid.
you
just
can't
discriminate.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
don't--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
you're
striking
down
particular
sales
that
were
favored.
i
think
what
you
are
doing
is
saying,
you
can't
disfavor
the
general
motors
purchases
from
the
out-of-state
marketer
of
natural
gas,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
only
a
small
volume
of
favored
sales
doesn't
matter,
that
the
whole
volume
of
disfavored
sales
is
still
treated
unconstitutionally.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
it
shows
that
they
occurred,
at
pages
229
and
230,
and
as
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument,
in
the
very
outset
of
the
respondent's
brief
they
mention
that
these
sales
occurred,
too,
and
it's
confirmed
in
the
amicus
brief
in
support
of
the
respondent
filed
by
columbia
gas
company.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
it
is
until
the
sales
tax
is
made
constitutional,
that
our
view
is
that
any
amount
of
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
and
in
favor
of
a
local
seller
or
a
purchaser
from
a
local
seller
is
unconstitutional,
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
never
required
that
there
be
a
particular
volume
of
discrimination,
and
i
think
it's
made
quite
clear
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
scope
of
the
discrimination
is,
it's
still
forbidden.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
yes,
justice
kennedy,
my
position
is
that
it's
still
unconstitutional,
but
that
would
be
on
a
different
theory.
i
think
obviously
there
have
to...
on
the
theory
that
the
discrimination
here
is
between
unregulated
sales
by
the
public
utility
and
the
out-of-state
marketer,
there
has
to
be
some
volume
of
sales.
there
is.
the
record
confirms
that,
and
the
amicus
brief
confirms
that.
but
i
think,
as
you
suggest,
we
would
also
say
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
sales,
which
is
not
the
situation
here,
even
if
there
had
been
no
sales
we
would
still
prevail
in
this
case
because
you
can't--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
the
record
does
confirm
that.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
it's
an
amicus
who's
in
this
business
and
who
said--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i'm
not
suggesting
they're
bound
by
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
the
record
and
the
public
orders
of
the
public
utilities
commission
and
the
respondent's
brief
provides
ample
evidence
that
these
kinds
of
sales
occurred,
and
occurred
during
the
period
that's
involved
here.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
believe
it's
the
state's
witness,
but
if
i
look
at
the
record
here
for
a
moment
i
can
tell
you.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
that's
the
counsel.
mr.
duffy's
sitting
here.
he
wasn't
the
witness.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
it's
the
tax
commissioner's
witness.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
i
would
because--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
the
argument
is
that
where
you
have
a
competitive
gas
market
like
this,
and...
you
cannot
favor
an
in-state
interest
simply
because
it
has
public
utility
status,
and
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
buck
and
kuckendall,
which
is
267
u.s.,
dealing
with
motor
transport...
it's
an
opinion
by
justice
brandeis
from
1925,
but
i
think
it's
still
good
law...
says
that
you
can't
come
in
here
and
say,
well,
this
is
a
market
that
needs
to
be
regulated
and
we're
going
to
require
certificates
of
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity,
we're
not
going
to
let
people
compete
from
out
of
state.
i
think
the
argument
that
you
could
treat
a
public
utility
differently
might
have
had
and
made
sense
20
years
ago.
i
don't
think
it
makes
sense
now.
there's
a
competitive
market,
there's
a
competitive
market
there
as
a
result
of
national
policy,
and
i
think
even
if
you
had
nothing
but
tariff
sales,
that
you
couldn't
discriminate
against
the
out-of-state
marketers.
that
wouldn't
be
permissible
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i...
certainly
it's
possibly
based
on
that.
they
suggest
that
it's
designed
to
compensate
for
the
gross
receipts
tax,
and
our
answer
is,
fine,
if
you
think
the
gross
receipts
tax
is
a
problem,
fix
the
gross
receipts
tax,
but
have
equality
in
the
use
tax
so
that
some
sellers
are
not
advantaged
and
others
disadvantaged.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
just
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
sutton
suggests
that
he's
not
sure,
but
maybe
these
unregulated
sales
by
public
utilities
would
not
be
taxed,
would
not
be
exempt.
there's
no
basis
for
that
in
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
distinguish
between
regulated
and
unregulated
sales
by
public
utilities.
all
public
utility
sales
are
exempt.
all
natural
gas
sales
are
exempt.
and
while
we
think
the
interpretation
of
the
carnegie
case
that
they
supply
is
not
correct,
if
that
interpretation
is
correct,
what
they're
saying
is,
anybody
who
can
claim
the
status
of
public
utility
can
come
into
any
part
of
the
state
and
make
exempt
sales
as
a
gas
marketer,
whereas
the
out-of-state
companies
are
never
going
to
get
the
exemption
if
they
can't
claim
that
public
utility
status.
the
congressional
policy
here,
we
suggest,
is
clear.
it's
in
favor
of
competition.
it's
in
favor
of
allowing
everybody
to
compete
on
an
equal
footing.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
that
policy
leads
to
the
same
conclusion
that
this
court's
commerce
clause
precedents
do,
and
that
is
the
discrimination
here
is
not
acceptable.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
can't
remember
one
either,
justice
kennedy,
but
suggest
that
this
might
be
an
appropriate
instance
in
which
to
rely
on
that
policy
as
illuminating
the
meaning
of
the
commerce
clause,
but
we
think
we
don't
need
that.
we
don't
need
a
finding
as
to
congressional
policy.
we
think
the
result
here
is
absolutely
clear
under
the
commerce
clause
precedents,
even
without
that.
thank
you.
