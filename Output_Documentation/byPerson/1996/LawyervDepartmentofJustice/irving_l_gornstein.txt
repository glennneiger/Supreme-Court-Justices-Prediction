mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
the
settlement
plan
is
constitutional,
and
that
the
district
court
did
not
violate
any
principles
of
federalism
in
approving
it.
on
the
constitutional
question,
i
wanted
to
make
three
points.
the
first
is
that
the
district
court
applied
the
correct
legal
standard
in
judging
the
constitutionality
of
the
proposed
plan,
that
it
correctly
drew
from
miller
the
principle
that
a
plan
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
only
when
a
challenger
can
show
that
race
predominated
in
the
design
of
the
district.
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
district
court
findings
of
predominant
motive
are
governed
by
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review,
so
that
the
district
court's
finding
in
this
case
that
district
21
was
not
predominantly
motivated
by
racial
considerations
is
subject
to
review
in
this
court
only
for
clear
error.
the
final
point
i
wanted
to
make
on
the
constitutional
question
is
that
the
district
court's
subsidiary
findings
show
that
its
ultimate
finding
on
predominant
motive
is
not
clearly
erroneous,
and
those
findings
are
that
the
district
is
sufficiently
regular
by
florida
standards
to
avoid
any
suggestion
that
race
predominated,
that
the
district
includes
a
genuine
community
of
interest,
and
that
the
district
affords
to
any
candidate,
without
regard
to
race,
the
opportunity
to
be
elected.
now,
those
findings
are
all
supported
by
the
record
and
are
together
sufficient
to
support
the
district
court's
ultimate
finding
that
race
did
not
predominate.
on
the
federalism
question,
we
think
it
was
entirely
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
resolve
the
litigation
without
making
a
formal
adjudication
based
on
the
state's
consent.
it
would...
it
is
one
of
the
principle
reasons
that
parties
enter
into
settlements,
is
to
avoid
a
formal
adjudication,
to
avoid
findings
of
liability.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
certainly
can
have...
is
required
for
there
to
be
an
inquiry
into
the
validity
of
386.
what
there
was
not
required
was
an
inquiry
into
the
validity
of
330.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
that
the
legislature
did...
had
ample
opportunity
to
convene,
and
to
legislate
a
plan
if
it
had
wanted
to.
it
was
faced
with
more
than
a
very
serious
claim
under
miller,
and
i
think
everybody
in
the
legislature
must
have
been
aware
that
the
florida
supreme
court's
plan
was
extremely
vulnerable,
and
still
it
did
not
convene
in
legislative
session,
and
instead
what
it
did
is,
its
authorized
representatives,
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
of
the
senate,
are
authorized
to
conduct
litigation,
and
they
negotiated
a
settlement.
now,
the...
that
settlement
says
that
it
shall
only--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
that
was
strictly
on
the
basis
of
a
representation
made.
that
was
the
determination
made.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
it
was--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i...
to
go
on
to
what
the
legislative
opportunity
was
here,
there
were
then
negotiations.
nothing
prevented
the
legislature
during
that
entire
time
that
negotiations
were
ongoing
to
intervene,
convene,
and
submit
a
plan.
then
there
was
a
settlement
agreement
presented
to
the
district
court,
and
that
settlement
agreement
says
that
this
shall
only
remain
into...
in
effect
unless
and
until
the
legislature
formally
enacts
a
different
plan
in
compliance
with
federal
and
state
law,
still.
now,
there
was
remedial
hearing
held
in
november.
the
district
court
did
not
approve
this
until
march.
there
was
a
long
period
of
time
in
which
the
legislature
knew
that
if
it
did
nothing
there...
the
district
court
had
before
it
a
proposal
that
it
could
resolve
at
any
time
to
resolve
this
litigation.
still
the
district
court
did
nothing,
and
it
has
done
nothing
since
to
change
the
plan
even
though
the
settlement
itself
says
that
it
only
remains
in
effect
unless
and
until
the
legislature
formally
adopts
a
different
plan
in
compliance
with
state
and
federal
law.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
let
me
break
that
down
into
two
parts.
there
is
the
prehearing
before
the
remedial
hearing,
and
then
there
is
the
remedial
hearing.
let
me
address
the
prehearing
first.
an
inquiry
was
made
by
the
department
of
justice,
do
we
have
to
submit
live
evidence
or
can
we
introduce
it
in
other
ways,
and
i
will
quote
from
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it's
a
pretrial
conference,
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
an
open
court
or
not,
but
i
think
it
probably
was.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
am
reading,
and
this
is
page
31
of
the
hearing
from
november
2,
1995,
and
i
don't
have
the
record
cite
to
that.
i
apologize
for
that.
but
the
presentation
that
the
proponents
of
the
settlement
agreement
are
to
lead
off
with:
is
it
the
court's
contemplation
that
it
be
evidentiary
in
nature?
should
we
be
prepared
to
put
witnesses
under
oath?
i
think
mr.
hill
might
have
mentioned
that
he
thought
it
might
suffice
simply
to
have
lawyers
present
the
plan,
but
if
a
full
evidentiary
presentation
is
preferred,
we
would
be
prepared
to
do
that.
it
is
a
matter
of
figuring
out
what
the
court's
preference
is
so
that
we
can
prepare
accordingly.
the
answer
comes,
i
assume
there
are
some
judges
somewhere
who
simply
enjoy
hearing
evidence.
no.
now,
i
take
that
to
be
a
response
that
the
proponents
did
not
have
to
put
on
live
evidence,
that
they
could
rely
on
the
attachments.
i
don't
take
that
to
be
a
preclusion
of
the
appellant
or
anyone
else
who
would
have
wanted
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
at
that
hearing
to
do
that,
and
i
think
when
we
get
to
the
evidence...
now,
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
185,
at
the
remedial
hearing.
the
bottom
of
the
page,
judge
tjoflat
says,
at
the
very
bottom,
mr.
hill
has
summarized
in
effect
what
is
in
the
record.
there
are
affidavits
in
the
record.
if
you
want
to
examine
mr.
guthrie
you're
free
to
do
so,
or
call
any
witness
you
want.
i
think
it
was
quite
clear
at
the
remedial
hearing
that
there
was
a
full
chance
to
put
on
evidence
for
the
appellant.
now,
if
the
appellant
didn't
think...
had
misunderstood
that
he
was...
and
thought
he
didn't
have
that
chance
before,
he
could
have
said
something
about
that.
he
could
have
said,
look,
i
didn't
think
that
i
was
going
to
get
that
chance.
i
need
more
time.
he
didn't
say
anything
like
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
mr....
the
appellant
in
this
case
was
not
satisfied
with
the
results
of
mediation,
and--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--yes,
with
the
idea
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
mediate.
yes.
i
think
that
the
rule
that
there
should
be
no
precondition,
that
there...
it
will
always
have
to
be
a
liability
finding
is
extremely
important
in
facilitating
settlements,
and
it
would
disserve
the
principles
of
federalism,
we
would
suggest,
to
make
the
states
the
only
parties
who
could
not
settle
cases
without
either
a
formal
adjudication
or
an
admission
of
liability,
because
when
an
admission
of
liability
is
required,
that
is
going
to
discourage
in
many
cases
voluntary
compliance
in...
with
the
law.
it
is
going
to
discourage
states
from
entering
into
settlements,
because
there
are
consequences
to
admissions
of
liability,
so
that
the
value
of
voluntary--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
that
that
would
certainly
dictate
the
result
of
attorney's
fees,
mr.
chief
justice.
