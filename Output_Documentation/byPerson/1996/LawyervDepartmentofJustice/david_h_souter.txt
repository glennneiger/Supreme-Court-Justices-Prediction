yes,
and
this
is
the
one
that
was
superseded
by
the
district
that
is
now
in
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
objected
because
to
do
so
was
packing.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the
packing
is
now
less,
i
don't
know
that
it
follows
that
they
still
find
it
objectionable.
you've
only
got...
your
district
is
what,
30-some-odd
percent
black
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
don't
know
that
there...
i
don't
know
that
we
can
infer
that
there's...
that
they
would
still
object,
when
in
fact
they
have
not
done
so.
or
that
it
makes
any
difference
whether
they
object
or
not.
