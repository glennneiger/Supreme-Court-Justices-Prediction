justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
is
this
the
district
that
the
florida
supreme
court
approved,
that
we're
looking
at
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
i
had
a
question
about
the
challenge
and
the
choice
of
forum.
you
are
attacking
a
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
and
you
come
into
a
federal
court
to
do
that.
was
there
not
a
means
by
which
you
could
have
fought
out
your
challenge
to
a
district
created
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
the
florida
state
system
so
you
wouldn't
have
the
embarrassment
of
a
federal
court
being
faced
with
a
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
that
it
was
impelled
to
reject?
could
you
have
gotten
a
remedy
by
appealing
to
the
state
system
rather
than
running
to
the
federal
courts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
doesn't
tell
me
why
you
couldn't
say...
i
mean,
the
equal
protection
clause
governs
the
state
of
florida,
as
it
does
the
nation.
why
couldn't
you
then
go
into
the
state
court
system,
make
precisely
the
argument
made
in
the
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
mean
in
that
case.
bring
the
case...
bring
another
case,
in
which
you're
saying,
florida
supreme
court,
we
know
you've
got
precedent,
but
you
were
acting
under
the
gun
of
the
department
of
justice,
so
we
want
to
free
you
from
that
thrall.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
i
appreciate
that
you
did,
but
there
was
a
certain
anomaly
in
you
coming
to
a
federal
court
to
in
effect
override
a
decision
of
the
state
court
and
then
say
that
the
federal
court
has
not
been
sufficiently
respectful
of
the
state
authorities.
maybe
you
haven't
in
coming
to
the
federal
court
rather
than
a
state
court
for
the
solution
to
your
problem.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
unusual
in
florida,
to
have
a
district
separated
by
a
body
of
water?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
claiming
now,
as
i
think
was
the
case
in
the
earlier
district,
that
they
put
together
rural
areas
with
urban
areas
on
both
sides
of
the
rivers,
or
the
bay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
this
wasn't
a
majority--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
let
me
understand.
i
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
talking
about
the
naacp
opposition
to
the
plan
that
the
florida
supreme
court
adopted,
the
one
that
we
saw
before
with
the
finger--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that
was
a
concern
with
packing
into
that
district,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
have
nothing
to
say
that
the
naacp
opposes
the
plan
that
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--court
approved,
that
the
federal
court
approved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
since
you
are
making
much
of
this
point,
mr.
lawyer
submitted
a
statement
together
with
plaintiff
scott
and
others,
a
statement
of
the
case,
representing
to
the
district
court
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
miller
case
there
are
no
issues
of
law
to
be
decided
by
the
court
in
this
matter.
accordingly,
the
only
issue
which
would
remain
for
the
court
to
decide
at
the
trial
on
this
matter
is
the
issue
of
the
appropriate
remedy.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
first
point
about
how
the
court
has
to
declare
the
old
district
unconstitutional,
this
is
a
stipulation
that
your
client
joined
and
said,
court,
we
all
agree
there's
nothing
for
you
to
decide
but
the
remedy
for
this
constitutional
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
accordingly,
the
only
issue
for
the
court
to
decide
at
the
trial...
at
the
trial...
is
the
issue
of
the
appropriate
remedy.
do
you
have
a
trial
on
how
much
time
to
give
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
i'm
just
reading
the
stipulation,
trying
to
find
out
what
that
means.
one
thing
it
says,
there's
no
issue
of
law
dividing
the
parties.
there's
only
the
question
of
the
appropriate
remedy,
and
that's
for
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
one
point
that
you
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
designer
of
the
plan?
am
i
right
that
it
was
the
state
senate's
expert
that
was
the
designer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
he...
did
he
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
this
witness
and
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no,
i
don't
choose
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
mr.
lawyer
have
an
opportunity
to
say,
i
want
to
call
witness
x,
y,
and
z,
i
want
to
cross-examine,
and
was
denied
that
opportunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
the
judge
not
told
by
the
representatives
of
the
legislature
that
the
legislature
just
wasn't
going
to
do
anything
about
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
it
had
done
its
thing
in
the
decennial
whatever,
and
that
the
article
of
the
constitution
that
you
cite
didn't
apply
except
at
the
10-year
redistricting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gornstein,
maybe
you
can
explain
something
to
me
about
this
record,
because
it
does
seem
that
in
the
beginning
the
plaintiffs,
everybody
was
trying
to
settle
this.
everybody
agreed
that
the
plan
was
vulnerable
under...
the
old
plan
under
miller,
and
there
was
the
stipulation
that
i
read,
and
then
there
seemed
at
some
point
there
was...
this
harmony
that
prevailed
about,
let's
stipulate,
let's
mediate,
broke
down,
but
it's
not
clear
to
me
how
that
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
going
into
mediation,
everybody
was
on
board.
