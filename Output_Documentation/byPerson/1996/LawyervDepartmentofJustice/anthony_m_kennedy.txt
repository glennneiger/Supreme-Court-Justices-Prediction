that's
4a
of
the
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
the
blue
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
state
parties,
as
you
understand
state
laws,
have
had
authority
to
concede
that
the
senate-approved
plan...
that
the
legislatively
approved
plan
was
unconstitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
did
not
make
that
concession,
however.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
court
indicate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
the
court
indicate
in
this
hearing
that
there
would
be
any
restrictions
on
the
matters
as
to
which
mr....
the
appellant
could
inquire?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
appellant
is
in
the
position
of
suggesting
that
there
be
redistricting,
or
that
the
old
district
be
approved,
and
faces,
as
the
court
faces,
a
difficult
task
in
determining
what
are
legitimate
criteria
for
districting?
what
are
community
interests?
what
are
legislative
preferences?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
must
exercise
its
discretion
to
have
before
it
and
to
have
available
to
the
parties
the
legislative
policies,
the
legislative
determinations
as
to
what
legitimate
district
criteria
are,
and
by
not
referring
this
to
the
legislature
and
accepting
too
quickly,
perhaps,
the
representations
of
state
officials,
the
court
and
the
appellant
were
deprived
of
that
data,
that
body
of
guidelines
that
are
necessary
to
make
appropriate
and
legitimate
districting
determinations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
going
to
read
from
the
record?
