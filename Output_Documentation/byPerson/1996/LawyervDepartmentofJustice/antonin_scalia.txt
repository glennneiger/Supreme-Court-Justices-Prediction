but
much
of
that
is
the
lake,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
did
the
naacp
oppose
it?
what
was...
why
did
they
think
that
would
harm
the
interests
of
the
black
voters?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry
to
get
you
into
this,
mr.
shapiro.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
just
curious.
you
shouldn't
waste
a
whole
lot
of
your
time
on
it.
i
was
just
curious
as
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
the
naacp
would
seem
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
it
now.
well,
could
you
explain
what
your
position
here
is?
you
say
you
never
consented
to
this
final
plan--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
took
what
went
on
as
simply
an
indication
that
at
least
unless
and
until
the
extant
district
was
declared
unconstitutional,
the
legislature,
simply
because
of
the
existence
of
a
lawsuit,
had
no
intention
of
creating
a
new
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
had
not
yet
been
adjudicated
to
be
an
unconstitutional
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
uncontested,
is
it
not,
that
the
legislature
had
no
opportunity,
after
this
court
had
determined
that
the
district
was
unconstitutional
and
therefore
could
not
be
used,
to
adopt
on
its
own
a
new
district?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
should
the
legislature
adopt
a
new
district--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
and
until
the
court
does
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
legislatures
don't
enact
new
legislation
just
because
there's
a
serious
risk,
and
some
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
did
not
think
that
these
individuals
had
the
authority
to
commit
the
legislature
to
a
whole
new
districting
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
letter
in
the
record
from
one
senator,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
there
is
a
serious
burden
on
whoever
is
taking
the
word
of
a
couple
of
members
of
a
state
legislature
that
the
state
legislature
as
a
body
concedes
to
redistricting
for
the
state.
i
think
there's
an
enormous
burden
to
show
that
that
representation
that
they
can
speak
on
behalf
of
the
legislature
is
true,
and
even
if
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record,
i
cannot
imagine
approving
a
federal
judge's
acceptance
of
the
majority
leader's
statement
just
on
its
face.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
the
statement
that
it
would
not
convene.
i
accept
that.
i'm
not
surprised
that
it
would
not
convene.
its
prior
plan
was
still
constitutional
as
far
as
it
knew.
i'm
talking
about
the
assertion
that
i
and
one
other
person
have
the
authority
on
behalf
of
the
entire
legislature
of
florida
to
agree
to
redistricting
of
the
state.
that's
an
extraordinary
assertion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it
is
one
thing
to
settle
litigation.
that
is,
to
agree
on
behalf
of
the
legislature
that
the
state
will
not
oppose
the
judicially...
the
judicially
imposed
districting.
that's
one
thing.
but
what
is
being
asserted
here
is
that
this
is
not
judicially
imposed
districting,
that
this
is
districting
that
was,
in
fact,
expressing
the
will
of
the
florida
legislature,
which
to
my
mind
is
an
important
thing
if
the
prior
district
was
never
declared
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
court
never
said
this
will
not
be
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel
here
has
just
misrepresented
flatly
that
the
statement--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
the
quote
say
this
will
not
be
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taranto,
i'm
prepared
to
accept
your
analysis
as
far
as
whether
the
district,
had
it
been
adopted
by
the
legislature,
would
be
unconstitutional.
my
problem
with
this
case
is,
i
think
it's
a
serious
matter
to
say
that
when
the
florida
legislature
as
a
whole
has
not
been
put
on
notice
that
its
existing
districting
is
unconstitutional,
and
has
not
been
given
an
opportunity
after
that
notice
to
itself
draw
a
district...
which
might
have
been
like
this,
but
then
again
it
might
not
have...
it
isn't
enough
for
me
that
this
district
be
constitutional.
i
also
would
like
it
to
be
the
district
that
the
voters
of
florida
wanted
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
court
could
have
given
them
an
opportunity
to
select
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
an
inquiry
by
the
court?
did
the
court...
on
what
did
the
court
base
its
assurance
that
it
had
the
authority
to
accept
this
as
the
will
of
the
florida
legislature?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
didn't
even
need
the
senators.
it
would
have
been
enough
to
have
the
attorney
general?
the
attorney
general
could
redistrict
the
state,
or
could
agree
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no...
there
was
that
statute.
now,
what
else
was
there
besides
the
statute
that
gave
the
attorney
general
authority?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
relevance
of
that.
there
was
no
state
agency
here,
was
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
basis
for
that
is?
you
can
give
me
no
citation
of
florida
law,
at
least
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
on
the
basis
of
a
representation
of
one
person,
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
ability
of
the
senate
to
participate
in
redistricting
of
the
state
is
disregarded
by
the
court.
i'm...
i'm
worried
about
that.
i--
