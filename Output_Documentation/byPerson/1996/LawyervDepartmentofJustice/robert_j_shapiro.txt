mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
district
court
used
an
unconstitutional
process
to
achieve
an
unconstitutional
result
in
the
form
of
plan
386.
before
commencing
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
make
a
correction
in
my
reply
brief
which
is
important
in
that
it's
a
reference
to
the
record.
on
page
14
of
the
reply
brief
i
referred
to
the
preclearance
denial
letter
of
the
justice
department
as
r.
18...
i'm
sorry,
as
r.
13,
and
it's
actually
in
the
record
at
r.
18,
and
the
full
text
is
at
r.
18.
i
also
would
like
to
just
briefly
refer
to
the
maps
which
are
attached
to
the
briefs.
if
i
may,
the
first
map
we
have
is
appendix
a
to
the
reply
brief.
this
is
the
legislatively
adopted
plan
which
was
approved
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
1992.
it's
called
sjr
2g.
this
is
district
21
in
yellow,
which
is
all
encompassed
within
tampa,
hillsborough
county,
florida.
the
next
map
we
have
was
the
court-ordered
plan
as
a
result
of
the
justice
department's
preclearance
denial
letter.
they
objected
to
it.
although
there
was
absolutely
no
history
of
voting
rights
act
violations
against
black
voters
in
hillsborough
county
they
were
covered
under
section
5
because
in
hillsborough
county
they
did
not
print
ballots
in
spanish
as
well
as
english.
so
there
was
no
congressional
finding
whatsoever
of
any
voting
rights
act
violations
against
blacks
in
hillsborough
county,
and
this
is
in
the
record
at...
let's
see,
if
i
may.
okay,
it's
at
record
at
r.
104,
which
i
didn't
put
in
my
brief.
r.
104,
page
3,
specifically
states
that.
you
can
see
that
this
district
extends
into
pinellas
county.
this
is
hillsborough
county.
it
goes
into
polk
county.
it's
called
the
polk
county
finger,
and
we
have
the--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--this...
what
you're
looking
at
is
the
district
that
the
florida
supreme
court
approved
under
the
duress
of
the
justice
department's
letter.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
the--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--this
is
appendix
b
to
the
brief
on
the
merits
for
appellant.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
correct.
this
was
the
one
that
was
challenged
by
the
plaintiff
in
his
lawsuit,
so
this
is
the
one
that
was
the
result
of
the
preclearance
denial
letter
by
the
justice
department.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
because
this
was
a
challenge
based
on
what
the
justice
department
had
forced
the
florida
supreme
court--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--first
of
all,
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
reserve
jurisdiction
over
this
issue.
it
reserved
jurisdiction
when
it
approved
this
district
in
597
so.2d.
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
florida
supreme
court
it
says,
we
reserve
jurisdiction.
but
when
it
approved
330
at
the
insistence
of
the
justice
department
it
did
not
reserve
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
plaintiff
had
the
right
to
contest
this
district
in
u.s.
district
court,
and
under
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well,
that
issue
was
resolved
in
the
trial
court.
there
were
motions...
there
were
actually
motions
to
dismiss
filed
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
florida
asserting
that
position.
those
were
denied
by
the
district
court,
and
that
was
not
appealed.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
i
don't
know
that
a
florida
trial
court
would
have
jurisdiction
in
the
voting
rights
act
case,
your
honor.
i
just
don't
know.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
this
would
be
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
court,
and
mr.
lawyer
had
a
right
to
make
a
shaw
claim
in
the
u.s.
district
court,
and
again,
there
was
a
motion
filed
by
the
attorney
general
to
abstain,
to
transfer
because
of
the
degrandy
litigation,
which
was
in
progress
at
the
time.
this
district...
this
plan
was
in
u.s.
district
court
in
the
northern
district.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well,
yes.
the...
in
fact,
and
that's
a
critical
aspect
of
this
case,
is
that
the...
at
no
time
in
this
litigation
did...
was
there
ever
an
adjudication
that
this
plan
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
because
what
they're
saying,
they
reserve--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--the
attorney
general...
i'm
sorry.
the
state
appellants
at
the
least,
specifically
in
their
settlement
agreement
said,
we
do
not
acknowledge
that
330
is
unconstitutional,
and
we
have
a
right...
if
their
settlement
plan
was
rejected,
they
retained
the
right
to
contest
that
330
was
unconstitutional,
and
that's
a
key
aspect
of
this
case,
in
that
there
was
never
an
adjudication
of
liability
that
that
330--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--i
believe
they
do.
they
do
not
concede
that
330
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
it
doesn't
bear
on
the
arguments.
i
do
not...
they
do
not
admit
that
330
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
correct.
this
is
386.
this
was
the
settlement
plan
that
was
approved
by
the
federal
court.
now,
you
can
see
what
happened
with
the
map
that
was
produced
at
the
"fairness
hearing".
there's
no
political
subdivisions
that
are
even
included
in
this,
when
you
talk
about
disrespect
for
political
subdivisions.
here's
tampa
bay.
it's
a
huge
body
of
water.
although
there's
the
shoreline
which
is
depicted,
it
doesn't
really
reflect
which
portion
of
pinellas
county...
pinellas
county
is
over
here.
you
don't
know
that
because
it's
not
on
here.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well,
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
our
map.
we
have
enhanced
the
map.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
this
is
a
rather
large
body
of
water.
now,
if...
i'm
sorry
everybody
can't
see
it,
but
this
is...
you
can
now
see
the
contours,
for
the
first
time,
of
the
district.
the
district
is
a
tiny
portion
of
pinellas
county
over
here.
i'm
referring
now
to
appendix
b
of
the
brief
on
the
merits
for
the
appellants.
this
is
in--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
st.
petersburg
is
over
here,
and
that
is
a
portion
of
pinellas
county,
but
this
is
all
pinellas
county.
they
chose
this
portion
of
pinellas
county.
now,
what
they
did
was,
they
eliminated
that
part
that
went
over
to
polk
county,
but
they
retained
this
at
the
insistence
of
the
justice
department.
now,
if
you
look
at
this
little
spit
of
land
here,
this
was
included
as
well,
so
it
goes
all
the
way
across,
and
if
you
look
back
at
the
plan
that
was
presented
to
the
court,
it
looks
like
one
contiguous
compact
piece
of
land.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well,
i
don't
know.
judge
tjoflat
said,
well,
we
assume
there's
no
houseboats
there.
that's
what
he
said
in...
at
the
fairness
hearing.
well,
there
are
no...
they
have
a
lot
of
fish
there,
and
they
don't
vote.
[laughter]
but
as
we...
as
mr.
lawyer
made
clear
this
is
only
part
of
the
picture
though,
the
shape
of
the
map
and
irregular
aspect
of
it.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well,
it
is
not
unusual
to
be
separated
by
a
body
of
water,
but
it's
a
totally
different
proposition
when
there...
when
a
district
has
to
be...
a
piece
of
land
has
to
be
in
some
district,
say
in
an
island
and
the
florida
supreme
court
stated
this
in
their
original
decision.
they
said,
look,
in
florida
there's
a
lot
of
water,
so
just
because
a
district
encompasses
water
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
noncontiguous.
it's
another
proposition
for
the
district
to
artificially
reach
over
this
huge
body
of
water
for
the
specific
exclusive
purpose
of
including
black
voters
in
order
to
boost
the
population
of
the
entire
district,
and
that
was
the
exact
purpose
of
the
designers
of
this
plan,
was
to
go
across
at
this
highly
dense
black
community
in
pinellas,
where
they
had
been
in
their
own
district.
in
fact,
it's
truly
emblematic
of
this
case
that
if
you
look
at
21,
whereas
under
their
plan
they
presented
to
the
court,
the
number
21
was
in
yellow,
now
the
two
is
submerged
in
water,
so
it's...
so
they
have
jumped
across
tampa
bay
and
taken
these
counties,
which
used
to
be
in
other
districts.
they
were
in
other
districts.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
eliminated,
this
finger,
but
when
you
create
a
monster,
you
can
cut
the
fingers
off,
it's
still
a
monster.
this
finger
was
cut
off
that
led
to
polk
county,
which
was
rural,
but
the
naacp
opposed
the
plan
of
joining
pinellas
county
over
here,
because
they
said
there's
not
even
a
cohesive
black
community
in
the
tampa-hillsborough
area,
much
less
the
pinellas
area.
they
opposed
it.
but
what
the
justice
department
did
was,
it
insisted
that
in
order
to
create
an
additional
majority
district,
that
they
must
join
the
populations.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
it
is
not
a
majority,
but
the
purpose
was
to
create
a
majority--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--because
they...
they
were
correct.
this
plan...
this
is
striking.
sixty-four
percent
of
all
pinellas
county's
blacks
are
now
in
plan
386.
even
more,
74
percent
of
manatee
county's
blacks
are
in
the
plan,
so
they
bleach...
and
the
naacp
said,
look,
you
re
bleaching
the
surrounding
areas
of
their
influence,
because
you're
taking
a
pocket
of
black
voters,
and
you're
forcing
them
into
that
plan
where
they
don't
belong.
now,
the
justice
department--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--no.
they
are
not
a
party
to
this
appeal,
and
they
were
not
involved
in
this
litigation.
but
when
the...
here's
the
point.
when
the
florida
supreme
court
considered
the
idea,
at
the
insistence
of
the
justice
department,
that
they
cross
tampa
bay
to
pick
up
this
pocket
of
black
voters,
the
florida
supreme
court
in
the
601
so.2d
copy
said,
but
these...
this
is
not
a
compact
group
of
black
voters.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
this
plan,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
no.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
no,
we
don't.
but
those
comments
that
they
made
before
the
florida
supreme
court
are
directly
relevant
to
this
case,
because
they
said...
they
said
to
the
court
they
objected
to
any
plan...
any
plan
which
would
cross
tampa
bay
and
join
these
populations.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
it's
36-percent
black.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
i'm
just
pointing
that
out
to
say
that
there
was
a
substantial...
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
saying,
we
do
not
believe
that
we're
obeying
our
traditional
neutral
districting
principles
by
doing
this,
but
we're
doing
it
because
under
duress
of
the
justice
department--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
no,
of
course.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
okay.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
we
never
consented
to
it.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
correct,
and
it
does
so
for
several
reasons.
number
1,
this
was
called
a
hybrid
consent
decree.
that's
what
the
majority
of
the
court
called
this.
the
notion
of
the
consent
decree,
however,
is
you
have
to
have
consent.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
correct,
and
he
objected
to
it.
he
objected
ad
nauseam
to
386,
and
he
insisted
upon
an
adjudication
that
330
be
declared
unconstitutional.
what
the
court
did
was,
instead
it
made
a
conscious
decision
that
instead
of
actually
adjudicating
330
unconstitutional,
that
it
would
submit
the
matter
to
mediation,
and
the
purpose
of
the
mediation
was
to
allow
the
parties
to
come
up
with
a
remedy
or
a
substitute
plan.
the
problem
is,
that
does
an
end
run
around
the
florida
legislature,
which
in
the
traditional
cases
that
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
and
over,
including
miller,
this
court
has
said
it's
the
province
of
the
state
legislature--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
if
i--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--in
the
way
it
was
done.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
i
would
take
the
position
that
mr.
lawyer...
that's
a
complicated
question,
because
in
a
usual
consent--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
it--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--no.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's...
it's
wrong
on
both
counts.
the
procedure
was
wrong
because
the
footprint
of
the
federal
judiciary,
in
this
case
the
district
court,
was
put
on
the
process
and
a
coercive
order
was
entered
without
any
adjudication.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
from
the
court?
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
okay.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
a
nonconsenting
plaintiff
cannot
have
substantive
issues
resolved
against
them
in
the
context
of
a
consent
decree.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
as
to
the
other
nine,
but
mr.
lawyer
lives
in
386,
and
in
fact
he's
the
only
plaintiff
in
this
case
who
had
standing
to
challenge
330.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
exactly.
it's
a
coercive
order.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
they
couched
it
in
terms
of
a
consent
decree.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
i
will.
the...
330
itself...
386
was
approved
by
the
court.
now,
what
our
position
is
on
this
case
is
that,
as
i
said,
the
original
district,
330,
was
never
declared
unconstitutional,
but
it
was
a
product
of
coercion
by
the
justice
department.
now,
what
happened
here
is--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--because...
it
absolutely
does,
because
the
coercive
order
of
a
federal
court
is
based
upon
adjudication.
a
federal
court
can
only
order
a
remedy
where
there
has
been
an
adjudication,
or
there
has
been
some
admission
of
liability.
here,
there
was
never
an
admission
of
liability.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
by
the
remedy
he
meant
how
much
time...
this...
how
much
time
the
court
should
give
the
legislature
to
decide
what
the
replacement
plan
would
be.
he
did
not
specify
that
the
court
should
actually
decide
what
the
plan
should
be,
so
he
didn't...
he
said
the
remedy,
meaning
how
much
time
to
give
the
court,
how
much
time
to
give
the
legislature.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
there
was
never
a
trial
period
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
what
he
meant
by
that
was
that
he...
the
remedy
meaning
the
court
should
determine...
assuming
that
there's
an
unconstitutional
district,
the
court
should
then
determine
how
it's
supposed
to
act,
and
it's
supposed
to
act
by
referring
it
back
to
the
legislature.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
no.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
i
get
to
that.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
we
do.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
we
do.
what
happened
in
this
case,
the
court
in
approving
plan
386
did
not
adequately
apply
the
miller
standards.
they
held...
instead
of
determining
and
applying
those...
that
case
very
carefully
they
said,
well,
386
is
better
than
330,
so
we're
going
to
approve
it.
they
said
that
it
was
benign
and
statute
satisfactorily
tidy,
because
it
was
better
than
330.
that's
not
an
accurate...
an
adequate
application
of
miller.
instead
of
using
the
community
of
interest
analysis
in
miller
in
looking
at
the
actual
objective
evidence
in
terms
of
what
these
communities
are,
they
held...
they
used
a
fairness
hearing
as
a
referendum
and
said,
well,
we're...
because
we
have
a
fairness
hearing
and
we've
put
a
notice
in
the
newspaper
that
anybody
who
wants
to
contest
386
could
come
to
the
court
and
do
that,
the
court
in
this
case,
the
district
court
said,
well,
nobody
showed
up
and
objected
to
plan
386,
so
therefore
there
must
be
a
community
of
interest.
the
statistics
of
the
case
are
also
important.
the
statistics
are
that
although
330
had
45
percent
black
voters
of
v.a.p.,
this
plan
had
36
percent,
so
that
a
significant
number
of
black
voters
were
moved
from
their
place
over
here
in
pinellas
county
into
district
21
when
they
normally
would
not
be
there.
there
was
no...
and
one
of
the
key
aspects
is...
i
know
i've
harped
on
this,
but
in
adopting
the
procedure
that
the
court
used
of
using
mediation
in
a
secret
sessions
to
design
this
plan,
in
effect
there
is
no
report
or
any
evidence
of
the
exact
factors
that
the
designers
of
the
plan
used.
miller
absolutely
mandates--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--correct.
he...
his
report
went
into
the
record,
and
i
will
tell
you
that
mr.
lawyer
was
threatened
with
sanctions
in
this
case
if
he
divulged
the
contents
of
the
negotiation.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes.
yes,
he
did.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
he
did.
he
did,
but
there
was...
he
was
permitted
to
cross-examine
the
witness,
but
there
was
no
oral
testimony
at
that...
there
was
no
one
under
oath,
there
was
no
oral
testimony
whatsoever
at
the
fairness
hearing,
and
there
were
no
findings
of
fact,
which
is
the
most
critical
aspect
of
this
case,
really.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
he
wasn't
denied
the
right
to
call
witnesses,
but
there...
this
was
not...
the
judge
was
asked
at
the
pre-trial
conference,
is
this
going
to
be
an
evidentiary
hearing?
he
said,
i
suppose
you
could
find
a
judge
somewhere
who
liked
to
hear
evidence,
but
no,
this
is
not
an
evidentiary
hearing.
so
he
specifically
ruled
that
this
would
not
be
an
evidentiary
hearing,
so
to
say
that
mr.
lawyer
had
a
burden
at
that
hearing
to
prove
the
district
unconstitutional,
or
that
he
failed
to--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--yes,
but
the
plan
was
never
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
at
the
fairness
hearing.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
there
was
no
testimony.
it
was
a
hearing,
and
it
was
not
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
it's
clear
that
judge
merryday
stated
at
the
pretrial
conference
this
will
not
be
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
that's
the
point.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well,
he
was
given
a
chance
by
the
judge.
guthrie,
the
person
for
the
state,
he
didn't
testify.
he
put
his
affidavit
in
the
record
and
judge
tjoflat
said,
we'll
consider
that
his
direct
testimony.
if
you
want
to
cross-examine
him,
go
ahead.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
declined,
but
that
was
not
an
evidentiary
hearing,
so
to
say--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--the
next
best
thing,
but
he
had
no
burden
to
prove
plan
386
was
unconstitutional,
because
plan
386
was
never
properly
before
the
court.
because
they
did
an
end
run
around
the
legislature,
it
was
never
referred
to
the
legislature.
therefore,
to
say
that
he
had
a
duty
or
a
burden
at
all
at
that
hearing
is
incorrect.
he
had
no
burden
under
miller
or
anywhere
else
to
prove
that
that
district
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--everybody,
including
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida,
expected,
and
stated
to
the
district
court,
that
the
state
legislature
had
the
right
to
convene.
in
fact,
the
district
court
was
asking
for
status
reports.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
state
legislature
never
had
to...
it
was
never
triggered,
a
special
session,
because
there
was
no
adjudication
that
the
original
district
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
exactly.
what
the
court
was
saying
was,
because
of
miller
v.
johnson
for
the
u.s.
supreme
court,
we
note
that
the
florida
legislature
has
not
spontaneously
convened
itself
to
rectify
the
situation.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
no.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
because
this
court
has
made
clear
repeatedly
that
this
is
a
matter
that
is
to
be
reserved
for
the
states
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
it's
federal
because
the
court
has
made
clear
that
this
is
a
matter
which
is
to
be
resolved
first
by
the
state.
it's
a
u.s.
constitutional
issue
of
federalism.
it's
a
federalism
issue
that
mr.
lawyer
had
a
right
to
have
his
state
legislature
make
that
decision
in
the
first
instance
as
a
matter
of
federalism,
but
also--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--thank
you.
