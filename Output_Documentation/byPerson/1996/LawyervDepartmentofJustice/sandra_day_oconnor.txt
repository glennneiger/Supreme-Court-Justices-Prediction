justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
in
this
court
though
they
don't
contest
that
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--386,
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
you've
never
agreed
with
it,
and
that
you
did
not
get
relief
at
the
state
level,
and
you
assert
that
the
plan,
386,
violates
this
court's
constitutional
standards.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
your
client
did
not
consent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
was
a
party
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
still
so
confused
by
your
position
here.
do
you
want
this
court
to
just
focus
on
the
fact
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--wait
a
minute.
you
didn't
even
hear
the
question,
and
you've
already
answered
it.
do
you
want
to
hear
the
question
and
then
answer
it?
you
appear
to
be
here
arguing
that
the
procedure
followed
by
the
federal
district
court
was
erroneous
because
it
didn't
first
find
unconstitutionality
of
plan
330,
and
furthermore
it
did
not
then
await
an
opportunity
for
the
legislature
to
adopt
its
own
plan,
so
much
of
the
argument
centers
on
that.
on
the
other
hand,
do
you
have
an
argument
here
at
all
to
the
effect
that,
irrespective
of
that,
what
the
court
ended
up
with
by
virtue
of
the
agreement
of
the
other
parties,
other
than
lawyer,
is
itself
unconstitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
get
to
both
of
those
arguments
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
just
so
confused.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
court
below
ever
enter
an
order
saying,
and
i
hereby
give
60
days
or
90
days
or
something
in
which
the
legislature
can
act,
or
did
he
just
accept
somebody's
statement
that
the
legislature
wasn't
going
to
be
called
into
special
session?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
frankly,
looking
at
the
series
of
maps,
it
didn't
strike
me
as
terribly
important
if
we
were
to
say
the
district
judge
should
have
found
the
plan
330
unconstitutional
before
deciding
which
plan
to
adopt,
and
if
it
went
back,
the
court
could
probably
make
that
finding.
it
is
a
most
unusual-looking
district--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
chances
are
the
court
would
say
plan
330
was
unconstitutional,
therefore
i
have
to
adopt
a
plan,
and
the
plan
i'm
going
to
adopt
is
386.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there
were
a
party,
as
there
appears
to
be
here,
to
the
proceedings
below
who
didn't
consent,
is
that
party
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
district
court
says
yes,
i'm
going
to
go
with
386?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
court
say
this
is
not
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
in
the
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
this
a
matter,
though,
perhaps
of
federal
law?
this
court
seems
to
have
indicated
its
position
that
a
district
court,
before
drawing
its
own
plan
to
replace
one
that
appears
to
be
invalid,
or
has
been
found
to
be
invalid,
should
give
the
state
legislature
an
opportunity
to
address
it.
now,
could
we
mean,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
that
the
full
legislature
should
have
an
opportunity
to
draw
up
a
plan--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
that
we
don't
accept
the
notion
that,
pursuant
to
settlement
authority,
the
attorney
general
can
come
in
and
say,
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
state,
we
accept
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
was
not
given
within
the
context
of
a
finding
that
plan
330
was
invalid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
can
certainly
understand
that
a
state
and
this
court
might
be
willing
to
accept
the
notion
that
the
attorneys
on
behalf
of
the
state
could
agree
that
the
former
plan
was
unconstitutional.
now
let's
go
from
there.
is
it
nevertheless
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
the
full
legislature
be
given
an
opportunity,
following
that,
to
adopt
a
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
the
concern
expressed
by
this
court
in
saying
there
should
be
such
was
a
concern
on
behalf
of
the
states
that
the
federal
court
shouldn't
intrude
and
take
upon
itself
the
job
of
drawing
a
legislative
district
without
finding
a
good
reason
for
it,
to
wit,
invalidity
of
what
the
legislature
had
put
its
task--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--its
hand
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
wasn't
a
consent
decree,
of
course,
because
we
have
a
petitioner
here
who
didn't
consent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
wasn't
a
consent
decree.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
your
position
is
that,
as
far
as
the
state
legislature
and
the
state
itself
is
concerned,
that
counsel
had
a
right
to
waive
any
finding
of
unconstitutionality,
and
they
did
so,
and
the
state
had
a
right
to
waive
any
opportunity
to
redraw
a
district,
and
they
did
so.
is
that
your
position,
in
essence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
how
can
it
do
so
as
against
somebody
who
didn't
consent,
to
wit,
the
petitioner
here?
how
can
it
avoid
some
opportunity
to
have
evidence
put
on
and
conduct
a
full
inquiry
into
the
validity
of
plan
386?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
agree
that
mr.
shapiro
erred
in
stating
that
the
court
below
at
its
hearing
on
386
said
it
would
not
be
an
evidentiary
hearing?
