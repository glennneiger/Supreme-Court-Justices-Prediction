justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-2024,
c.
martin
lawyer,
iii,
v.
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
you
would
have
had
much
of
a
chance
had
you
gone
into
a
florida
trial
court
and
said
that
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
was
a
mistake?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
does
that
bear
on
the
arguments
you're
trying
to
make?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then,
why
don't
we
go
to
the
district
which
basically
we're
talking
about
here,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
now
know
where
tampa
bay
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
where
st.
petersburg
is,
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
the
district
court
rule
against
him
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you've
been
arguing
now
for
20
minutes.
you've
only
got
10
minutes
left,
and
you
challenged
the
decree
on
the
merits,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
get
to
that
part
of
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
that
bear
at
all
on
the
validity
of
the
most
recent
plan,
the
court-ordered
plan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
was
it
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
was
testimony
taken
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
how
would
he
have
had
a
chance
to
cross-examine
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
he
did
have
a
chance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
client
declined.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
certainly
the
next
best
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
taranto.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
any
event
his
client
was
offered
a
chance
to
cross-examine.
you
know,
most
people
would
think
of
that
as
an
evidentiary
hearing,
i
gather.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
indicating
objections
on
the
part
of
legislators
to
this
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
all
people
sitting
around
in
the
judge's
chambers,
perhaps,
or
in
open
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
attorney's
fees,
i
suppose,
for
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
