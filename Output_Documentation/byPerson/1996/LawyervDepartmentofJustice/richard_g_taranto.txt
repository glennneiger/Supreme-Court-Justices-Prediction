mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
equal
protection
holding
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed,
we
suggest,
because
there's
ample
evidence
to
find,
under
this
court's
recent
decisions,
that
race
did
not
predominate
over,
did
not
subordinate
other
districting
principles
in
the
design
of
plan
386,
and
the
court
should
find
no
federalism
problem
here
because
the
district
court,
acting
only
after
giving
the
legislature
an
opportunity
to
convene,
then
properly
allowed
authorized
state
officials
to
resolve
the
serious
federal
claim
here
by
proposing
a
lawful
districting
plan,
giving
appellant
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
that
plan--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
it's
a
combination
of
those.
in
july
of
1995,
after
this
court
decided
miller,
there
was
a
status
conference
at
which
everyone
recognized
this
claim
had
now
become
substantially
more
risky
than
it
had
been
before.
part
of
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
enter
an
order
directing
the
state
parties
every
30
days
to
file
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
court
saying
whether
the
state
legislature
would
be
convened
to
address
what
was
now
recognized
to
be
a
serious
federal
claim.
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
this
court...
the
court
did
not
determine
that
plan
330
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
because--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--because
i
think
the
legislature,
represented
by
the
speaker
here
and
the
president
of
the
senate
and
the
attorney
general,
was
fully
aware
that
there
was
a
serious
risk
of
invalidation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
thing
in
the
record--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that
letter
was
not
in
the
record.
it
was
rejected
because
it
was
improperly
filed,
and
had
that
issue
ever
been
joined,
which
it
has
never
been
joined,
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
that
we
would
have
submitted
had
the
issue
ever
been
raised,
to
support
the
authority.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
authority
has
not
been
questioned.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
was
not
simply
submitted
on
its
face.
exactly
the
same
statements
were
made
to
the
florida
supreme
court
after
preclearance
was
denied
to
the
original
plan
that
the
legislature
would
not
convene,
and
therefore
judicial
action
was
going
to
be
required.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
extraordinary.
i
think
state
parties
are
defendants
in
federal
courts
all
of
the
time.
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law
what
authority
they
have
through
whoever
the
party
is
to
settle
litigation.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
authorities
to
show
that
the
florida
authorities,
including
the
attorney
general
and
the
state
parties,
the
state
legislative
parties,
did
have
that
authority,
and
that
has
never
been
contested
here.
the
district
court
here
took
great
care
to
assure
itself
that
it
was
not
allowing
itself
to
be
used
to
usurp
authority.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
what's
going
on
here
is
that
there
is...
by
the
time
the
summer
of
1995
comes
around
there
is
a
very
serious
federal
challenge.
authorized
state
officials
i
don't
think
are
required
or
should
be
stripped
of
the
authority
to
resolve
that
litigation
voluntarily
as
other
defendants
can
resolve
their
federal
claims.
that
seems
to
me
to
turn
federalism
principles
upside
down.
consent
decrees
are
routinely...
customarily,
as
this
court
said
in
maher
v.
gagne,
entered
without
liability
findings
against
state
defendants
and
it
would,
i
think,
strip
them
of
an
important
authority--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--would
have
had
authority,
yes,
as...
litigating
authority,
absolutely.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
they
did
not
make
that
concession.
that's
right.
and
the
issue--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
issue
in
the
district
court
was
never
pressed
whether,
had
judge
tjoflat's
view
prevailed
that
the
court
had
agreed
that
a
liability
judgment
had
to
be
entered,
whether
we
would
have
accepted
that
as
a
condition
to
the
entry
of
the
remedy.
that
issue
was
simply
never
presented.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
when
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--when
i
say
that
the
issue
was
not
joined,
the
state
appellees
are
prepared
to
accept
and
were
prepared
to
accept
back
in
november
20...
november
20,
a
judgment
entering
a
finding
of
liability
without
conceding
the
constitutional
issue.
it
was
not
pressed
at
the
point,
and
not
necessary,
so
we
would
accept
an
affirmance
under
judge
tjoflat's
route.
what
we
do
think
is
that
this
district,
the
1995
district,
is
constitutional
under
this
court's
standards,
and
all
of
what
i
think
this
court
said
last
term
in
the
bush
case
and
the
shaw
case
indicates
that
there
is
a
variety
of
evidence
that
bears
on
that
question.
here,
the
evidence
is
partly
what
there
is,
and
partly
what
there
isn't.
what
there
isn't
is
any
block-by-block
separation
of
races.
what
there
isn't--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--absolutely,
and
he
got
it.
he
was
invited
to
put
on
evidence.
the
reference
to--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--absolutely
not.
he's
taking
one
quote--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
wrong.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
is
not
in
the
record.
he's
referring
to
a
statement
at
the
end
of
the
november
2
status
conference
in
which
the
justice
department
attorney
said,
i'm
a
little
confused,
your
honor,
about
how
you
want
to
handle
the
hearing
that's
coming
up.
do
you
want
us
to
put
on
oral
evidence?
and
the
judge
said,
i
suppose
somebody,
some
judge
here
wants
to
hear
oral
evidence,
and
what
happened
was
of
course
that
all
of
the
affirmative
evidence
of
the
state
was
put
on
in
writing.
what
happened
then
was
that
mr.
lawyer
was
invited
several
times,
put
him
on
the
stand
and
cross-examine
him.
ask
him
what
his
instructions
were.
ask--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--never
said
this
will
not
be
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
at
the
hearing--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--he's
taking
one
quote
that
was
addressed
to
the
justice
department
lawyer--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
and
i
don't
even
think
that
the
quote
as
he
quotes
it
says
it.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
absolutely.
he
said
that...
the
man
who
sat
down
with
the
computer,
he
has
said
in
writing
what
he
did.
put
him
on
the
stand.
ask
him
what
his
instructions
were,
what
your
data
were,
did
you
use
race
as
a
proxy
for,
or
disproportionately...
do
you
have
more
racial
data
than
nonracial
data,
as
in
the
texas
case?
did
you
try
to
draw
things
block-by-block?
what's
your
information
about
what's
inside
the
district
and
what's
outside
the
district?
do
the
people
who
live
along
the
coast
own
boats?
are
they
the
same
socioeconomically
as
the
people
who
live
between
the
freeways
here?
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
none
of
that
was
done.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
the
one
restriction
that
was
pressed
by
judge...
chief
judge
tjoflat
was
a
restriction
about
asking...
about
putting
the
justice
department
attorney
on
the
stand
and
that,
i
think,
is
actually
a
perfectly
proper
discretionary
evidentiary
ruling.
there
is
a
general
rule
that
says
you
don't
make
a
lawyer
a
witness
in
the
case
absent
compelling
need.
before
you've
examined
the
man
who
drew
the
district,
before
you've
examined
the
state
officials
who
actually
negotiated,
you
couldn't
possibly
show
a
compelling
need,
and
there
was
no
showing
of
that
sort
by
appellant.
appellant
was
allowed
to
submit
statistics,
allowed
to
submit
a
different
plan,
allowed
to
submit
his
own
maps,
some
of
these
maps...
he
was
invited
to
put
on
any
evidence
he
had
and
under,
i
think,
this
court's
decision
in
local
93,
it
is
very
clear
that
once
the
other
parties
to
the
case
agreed
on
a
decree,
that
couldn't...
that
by
itself
couldn't
adjudicate
his
rights,
but
he
had
an
opportunity
to
adjudicate
his
claim
that
this
district
was
unlawful.
and
i
think
this
district
cannot
be
found
unlawful.
it
is
not
a
safe
minority
district.
it
is...
geographically
and
economically
shares
a
real
community
of
interest.
there's
plenty
of
evidence
to
that
effect.
there...
this
is
not
a
district
that
had
the
kind
of
process
flaws
of
either
being
dictated
by
the
justice
department...
this
was
negotiated
in
a
wideranging
discussion,
including
appellant's
coplaintiffs
who
after
the
fact
came
in
and
said,
this
is
not
a
district
that
is
race-based.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
with
that
rule,
because
i
think
that
the
proper
federalism
rule
in
this
context
is
one
that
leaves
it
to
state
law
what
officials
have
the
authority
to
engage
in
what
kind
of
settlement
of
litigation,
and
that's
what
is
undisputed
here.
these
state
officials--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
not
at
all.
appellant
is
free
to
contact
any
senator
or--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
following
is
either
in
or
was
attempted
to
be
gotten
in
the
record.
there
was
this
one
letter
that
justice
scalia
referred
to
from
one
senator
who
sent
a
letter
ex
parte
to
each
of
the
three
judges,
one
of
which
was
returned
under
the
order
of
the
court,
and
he
said
i
don't
think
the
senate
can
represent...
can
speak
this
way
in
litigation.
otherwise,
there
is
nothing
on
that
issue.
there
is
a
public
comment
from
the
former
senator
at
this
hearing,
the
former
senator
of
this
district,
objecting
to
the
plan.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
several
things.
the
briefing
that
was
submitted
in
support
of
the
plan,
the
particular...
i
think
the
fullest
brief
was
by
the
united
states...
cited
the
state
statutory
authority
as
interpreted
in
various
decisions
giving
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
resolve
litigation.
there's
an
affidavit
in
the
joint
appendix
from
the
speaker
of
the
house
citing
the
house
rule
that
specific--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
as
a
matter
of
florida
law
that
is
probably
correct.
i
think
as
a
district
court
is
being
asked
to
enter
a
decree
that
resolves
a
serious
claim,
and
puts
in
place
a
new
plan
subject
to
any
change
that
the
legislature
wants
to
make,
it
needs
to
inquire
into
all
the
circumstances.
it's
a
harder
case
if
the
house
and
the
senate
both
came
in
and
said,
we
disagree
about
what
should
be
done.
that's
not
this
case.
here,
all
relevant
state
authorities
are
speaking
with
the
same--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--florida...
a
florida
decision,
in
particular
the
abramson
decision,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
that
says
state
agencies
can
violate
their
state
statutes
when
necessary
to
settle
a
serious
claim
against
them.
there
is
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
the
state
as
a
party
itself
is...
i
think
the
form
of
the
question
is,
could
it
change
its
state
statute
by
voluntarily
settling
through
the
attorney
general
a
serious
piece
of
federal
litigation?
i
think
the
abramson
decision
under
florida
law
is
supportive
of
that.
there
is
the
affidavit
of
the
speaker
citing
and
attesting
to
the
authority
under
the
house
rule,
and
then
there
was
a
series
of
representations
i
think
two
or
three
times
in
which
the
attorney
for
the
senate
was
asked
by
the
court,
are
you
sure
that
you
really
have
authority
to
be
representing
the
senate
here
and
he
said,
yes,
i'm
absolutely
sure.
i'm
absolutely
sure.
and
had
there
been
a
contest
about
that,
there
would
have
been
still
more
evidence
in
the
form
of
petitions.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
that
the
legislative
opportunity
was
given
over
the
course
of
several
months.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
doubt
about--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right,
but
the
price
of
that
rule
would
be
to
be...
to
insist
that
states
in
voting
rights
cases
may
never
voluntarily
resolve
their
claims.
in
fact,
they
do
on
a
number
of
occasions.
there's
a
consent
decree
in
the
johnson
v.
degrandy
case
in--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
an...
a
proper
opportunity
to
be
given.
i
think
it's
also
a
matter
of
federal
law
whether
there
should
be
a
rigid
rule
saying,
you
have
to
have,
in
this
one
class
of
cases,
an
adjudicated
violation.
i
think
that
that,
in
fact,
strips
states
of
an
important
authority
that
all
other
litigants
have
and
doesn't--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--but
i
think--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
it
is
also
a
good
reason
that
the
federal
claim
is
very
serious,
that
there
is
a
real...
a
real
risk
of
the
litigation.
it's
the
same
good
reason
that
supports
consent
decrees
without
liability
in
all
kinds
of
other
cases
against
states,
including--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--insofar--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned,
though,
it
is
a
consent
decree.
it's
a
consent
decree
between
the
four
other
plaintiffs
and
the
state
appellees
and
the
other
defendants,
and
by
the
way,
the
reason
that
is
plain
in
this
record
for
why
the
legislature
was
not
going
to
convene
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
there
had
been
an
adjudicated
violation.
it
has
to
do
with
a
series
of
political
problems
in
the
state
that
i
think
judge
merryday
referred
to
in
the
october
26
hearing
that
a
whole
series
of
important,
contentious
vetoes
are
triggered
for
override
the
minute
the
legislature
convenes,
and
that
was
not
going
to
happen.
i
don't
think
there
was
any...
that
it
would
have
made
any
difference
had
there
been
an
adjudication.
the
same
thing
would
have
happened:
thank
you
for
the
opportunity;
we're
not
going
to
do
it;
we
think
that
this
ought
to
be
resolved
here.
the
only
difference,
therefore,
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
regard
is
whether
this
declaratory
judgment
that
plan
330,
the
predecessor,
is
invalid,
a
different...
a
declaratory
judgment
that
can't
possibly
make
a
difference
to
appellant,
who's
already
had
that
plan
eliminated
by
court
order.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
thank
you.
