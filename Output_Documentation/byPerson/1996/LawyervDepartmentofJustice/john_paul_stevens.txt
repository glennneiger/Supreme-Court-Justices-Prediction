mr.
shapiro,
may
i
just
clarify,
is
anybody
now
claiming
that
plan
should
be
defended?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
is
anybody
now
claiming
that
it
is
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
so,
who?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
can't
tell
where
tampa
bay
is
on
that
map.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
suggesting
that
the
judges
down
there
didn't
know
where
tampa
bay
was.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that,
may
i
just
ask,
does
the
naacp...
are
they
a
party
to
the
appeal?
they
don't
challenge
it
now,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
if
there
had
been
a
finding
of
violation,
and
then
after
hearings
the
court
had
imposed
this
plan,
you
would
still
make
precisely
the
same
objections
you're
making
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taranto,
is
there
anything
in
the
decree
that
would
prevent
the
florida
legislature
today
from
redefining
the
district?
