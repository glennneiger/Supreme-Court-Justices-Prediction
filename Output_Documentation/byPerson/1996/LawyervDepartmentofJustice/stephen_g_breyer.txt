justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
so
if
you
win...
well,
you
started
by
saying
this
is
not
a
good
plan,
the
new
plan.
you
win
or
you
lose.
all
right.
so
if
you
win
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
you
win
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
under...
let's...
suppose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
we
were
to
say
that
this
new
plan
violated
the
constitution...
you
know,
the
cases
we've
held...
you'd
win
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
suppose
we
were
to
say
the
opposite,
that
you
lose
if
this
plan's
okay
constitutionally.
now,
is
that
the
end
of
this
case
as
far
as
you're
concerned?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean,
because
you
could
say
now
that
this
is
what
you
really
wanted.
you
wanted
an
adjudication
of
whether
this
plan
is
good
or
bad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
would
eliminate
a
whole
set
of
complex
procedural
issues.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
i
think
you're
going
to
say
is
no,
that
isn't
the
end.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
if
that
isn't
the
end
of
it,
why
not
precisely,
because
now
what
you're
doing
is,
you're
attacking
the
procedure,
so
even
if
this
is
a
good
result,
the
procedure
was
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
my
question
on
that
is
this.
suppose
the
four
people,
mr.
scott,
mr.
hargrett,
mrs.
simms,
and
mr.
james,
and
your
client,
five
people...
now
an
imaginary
case...
an
imaginary
case.
those
five
people
sue
somebody
for
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
want
an
injunction,
and
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
they
want...
i'm
just
making
up
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
sue
somebody.
mr.
white
they
sue,
okay,
and
they
say,
mr.
white,
you're
doing
a
bad
thing
here,
and
he
says
no
i'm
not,
and
now
they
say,
four
of
the
five,
not
your
client
but
the
other
four
say,
we'll
settle.
white
says,
i
won't
settle
if
i
have
to
admit
i
was
wrong.
we
won't
make
you
admit
it.
okay.
so
four
of
them
settle
with
mr.
white,
and
the
judge
then
simply
enters
a
decree
embodying
their
settlement
which
doesn't
admit
liability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
common,
garden
variety,
every
day
of
the
week.
the
fifth
person
doesn't
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
can
understand
why
the
fifth
person
can
attack
the
merits.
he
can
say,
mr.
white,
you're
doing
a
bad
thing
still.
but
i
don't
understand
how
that
fifth
person
could
object
to
the
fact
that
the
other
four
have
settled
with
mr.
white.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
doesn't
it
happen
every
day
of
the
week
that
people
are
in
cases
where
they
have
10
plaintiffs,
9
of
them
settle,
the
judge
looks
it
over,
he
says,
this
is
fine.
the
tenth
one
doesn't
agree,
so
the
judge
says,
okay,
tenth
one,
you
don't
have
to
agree.
you
can
maintain
your
suit,
but
i'm
entering
the
decree
as
to
the
other
nine.
that's
fair.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
aren't
those
matters
of
state
law?
i
mean,
whether
or
not
the
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--whether
or
not
the
state
of
florida
has
the
legal
power
to
agree
with
the
court
to
change
its
district
with
these
representatives
present
or
not
would
seem
a
question
of
state
law.
i
don't
see
what's
the
question
of
federal
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if,
in
fact,
the
court
introduces
a
decree
agreed
upon
by
our
four
plaintiffs
and
their
defendant,
mr.
white,
whether
mr.
white
has
the
power
to
make
that
agreement
to
the
decree
is
a
matter
of
mr.
white,
a
matter
of
the
state.
why
is
it
federal?
