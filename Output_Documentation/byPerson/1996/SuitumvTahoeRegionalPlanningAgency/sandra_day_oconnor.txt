but
it
might
have
relevance
as
to
whether
there's
a
taking,
conceivably.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
was
true
in
penn
central,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
were
the
tdr's
obtained
in
penn
central?
i
mean,
we
at
least
dealt
in
that
case
with
transferable
development
rights.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
apparently
they
were
considered
of
relevance
in
deciding
whether
there
was
a
taking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
existed
when
the
owner
bought
the
property
in
question
and
later
sued
on
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
any
event,
when
mrs.
suitum
bought
her
property
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
was
not
yet
in
existence
and
hadn't
developed
the
tdr?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there
is
some
residual
value
to
the
extent
the
property
might
want
to
be
acquired
by
a
neighbor
or
someone
else
to
have
a
larger
yard
or
additional
property,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
some
value,
apparently,
remaining
for
that
purpose.
we
don't
know
how
much.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
picnic
table?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
think
in
fact
there
is
some
residual
value
in
what's
left
for
sale
for
some
purpose,
obviously
less
than
it
would
be
if
a
house
could
be
built
upon
it.
if
there
is
such
a
value,
does
it
go
to
the
determination
of
whether
there's
a
taking
in
the
first
instance,
and
then
possibly
later,
if
there
is
a
taking,
to
the
amount
of
money
that
should
be
paid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
decides
that
there
may
be.
we
don't
need
to
make
the
factual
determination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
that
sounds
eminently
reasonable
in
light
of
the
evidence
that
we
do
have
in
front
of
us.
experts
have
given
their
opinion
of
the
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
don't
see
why
that's
a
requirement
for
ripeness.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
the
best
value
of
a
property
is
if
it's
sold,
but
we
have
many
claims
for
takings
where
the
property
isn't
sold,
and
no
court
requires
it
to
be
sold
in
order
to
determine
the
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
a
strange
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
goodness,
no
court
decided
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
taking
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
respondent--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--her
land
was
worth
more
than
$100,000
many
years
ago
as
a
location
to
build
a
house,
and
the
evidence
introduced
by
respondent
shows
that
the
rights
given
by
the
tdr's
and
the
other
rights
attaching
to
the
property
at
most
would
amount
to
what,
$30,000
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we're
not
going
to
decide
here
that
that
couldn't
be
a
taking.
my
goodness.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
why
not
give
this
poor,
elderly
woman
the
right
to
go
to
court
and
have
her
takings
claim
heard?
