m.

well,
at
the
outset,
i...
and
maybe
you
can
answer
this
question
very
easily.
i
don't
know
why
you
didn't
bring
an
inverse
suit
here,
number
1,
as
a
matter
of
choice.
i
don't
know
why
you're
not
required
to
do
so
under
williamson
as
a
matter
of
law,
unless
it's
peculiar
to
trpa.
there's
no
inverse
action
available
to
you
against
the
bi-state
agency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
bring
an
inverse
suit
against
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
don't
you
have
to
answer
it
under
williamson?
williamson
says
that
that's
what
you
must
do.
maybe...
is
it
because
the
agency
has
no
treasury,
i
guess,
to
pay
the
judgment,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes,
and
these
aren't
state
remedies
because
it's
a
bi-state
agency,
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
to
put
the
case
into
focus
you
should
go
to
inverse
condemnation
first
and
then
1983
if
there's
no
inverse
available.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
and
so
we
might
say
that
generally
we
do
not
know
that
there
are
routinely
inverse
suits
filed
against
the
agency
and
defendant
against
the
agency
as
they
would
be
against,
say,
the
state
of
california
or
the
state
of
nevada?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
volleyball
and
things
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
have
to
say
whether
it's
a
lucas
case
or
a
penn
central
case
in
order
for
you
to
prevail
on
the
ripeness
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
an
agency
said
that
you
can't
use
this
lot,
but
we
will
give
you
your
choice
of
one
of
four
other
residential
lots
which
appraisers
would
testify
are
comparable.
would
that
be
a
taking
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
there's
a
60-day
claims
period
against
trpa?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
mrs.
suitum
know
when
the...
even
under
1983
the
statute
runs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
because
of
the
nature
of
the
right
the
agency
itself
created.
you're
saying
that
agencies
can
diminish
ownership
rights
and
diminish
value
and
then
claim
as
a
defense
the
fact
that
this
can't
be
appraised
in
court.
this
is
a
very
strange
doctrine.
