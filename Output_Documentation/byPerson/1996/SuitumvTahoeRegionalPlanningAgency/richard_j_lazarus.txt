mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it's
exactly
that,
your
honor.
it
is
a
change
in
emphasis.
it's
not
a
change
in
the
bottom
line
reasoning
or
the
ultimate
result.
we...
as
this
case
has
progressed
our
thinking
has
evolved
somewhat
on
that
issue,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
best
way
to
view
the
ripeness
issue,
which
is
a
prudential
ripeness
issue
here,
the
best
way
to
view
it
is
in
strict
terms
of
finality
in
williamson
county
but
instead
in
terms
of
more
of
a
flexible
approach
a
prudential
ripeness
as
reflected
in
this
court's
decision
in
abbott
labs.
williamson
county--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
apply,
and
our
basic
position
is
that
the
abbott
labs
principles,
the
prudential
ripeness
principles
announced
in
abbott
labs,
which,
of
course,
was
a
case
involving
the
administrative
procedure
act,
should
apply
more
broadly
than
just
cases,
and
there's
no
reason--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
basically
our
position
is
that
prudential
ripeness
is
described
in
very
flexible
terms
in
abbott
labs,
and
at
those--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
we're
just
claiming
in
terms
of
federal
jurisdiction,
and--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
it's
just
a
question
of,
it's
a
jurisdictional
issue
to
the
extent
a
case
is
brought
in
federal
court,
and
cases
to
be
brought
against
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
under
the
compact
either
in
state
court
or
in
federal
court.
to
the
extent
that
they're
brought
in
federal
court,
though,
standing
requirements
would
apply,
both
prudential
and
constitutional,
and
ripeness
considerations
would
apply,
both
prudential
and
constitutional.
petitioner's
position
in
this
litigation
is
decidedly
at
odds
in
our
view
with
the
interests
of
property
owners
concerned
about
governmental
regulation.
they
are
challenging
a
ripeness
ruling
that
will
likely
help
them,
and
they
attack
a
tdr
program
that
furthers
rather
than
undermines
private
property
rights.
petitioner
offers
two
reasons
why
the
lower
courts
were
wrong
in
concluding
that
her
takings
claim
lacks
ripeness,
a
very
narrow
reason
and
a
broad
reason.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
addressing
first
petitioner's
narrow
argument,
because
i
believe
at
least
that
argument
presents
a
close
question.
petitioner's
narrow
argument
is
that
her
takings
claim
is
ripe
because
the
value
of
her
tdr's
can
be
determined
by
a
court
based
on
appraisals
without
any
effort
necessary
by
her
to
market
them
or
to
seek
any
possible
approval
of
the
transfer.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
and
we
do
agree,
your
honor,
that
the
appraisals
that
are
in
evidence
are
very
good
evidence
and
they're
weighty
evidence,
but
the
value
of
an
actual
marketing
effort
for
a
tdr
remains
great,
and
let
me
explain
why.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
your
honor,
this
is
a
unique
case,
because
tdr's...
most
real
property,
the
value
can
be
readily
determined
based
on
appraisals.
tdr's
are
fairly
unique
in
this
regard,
which
is
what
makes
the
value
for
the
fitness
of
the
issue
so
important
to
actually
have
a
marketing
effort.
let
me
try
to
explain
just
for
a
moment.
the
single
most
dispositive
factor
in
valuing
real
property,
as
we
all
know,
is
location.
well,
tdr's
arise
in
the
first
instance
out
of
ownership
at
one
location,
but
their
efficiency
and
their
effectiveness
is
that
they
can
ultimately
be
applied
to
many
locations.
until
one
starts
to
begin
to
identify
where
the
market
exists
for
the
tdr,
it's
very
hard
to
know
its
value.
a
tdr,
for
instance
in
placer
county
if
ultimately
applied
there
is
worth
far
less
than
in
washoe
county.
but
the
irony
here
is
if
you
look
back
to
the
old
tdr
cases
in
the
1960's,
the
early
litigation
in
penn
central,
it
was
the
property
owners
who
made
this
complaint
about
tdr's,
that
until
you--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--they
didn't
have
to.
these
could
go
to
properties
that
were
owned
by
mrs.
suitum
if
she
owned
them.
these
tdr's
are
actually
far
more
flexible
than
the
tdr's
in
penn
central
because
they
can
go
to
adjacent
property,
property
she
owns,
or
they
can
go
to
lots
of
people
in
the--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
fact
that
the
court
considers
the
tdr's
in
the
penn
central
case
relevant
both
to
the
economic
impact
and
considered
to
be
use
of
the
property
did
not
turn
on
the
happenstance
that
they
actually
owned
some
other
property
nearby.
if
mrs.
suitum
owned
some
other
property
nearby,
the
tdr's
could
be
applied
there.
the
tdr's
here,
though,
are
far
more
flexible.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
60-day
claims
period
would
not
apply
in
this
case.
this
is
a
section
1983
case,
and
under
section
1983
the
general
limitations
period
applicable
in
nevada
for
personal
injuries
pursuant
to
this
court's
decisions
in
wilson--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
statute
would
run
in
our
view,
the
way
we
approach
the
case,
that
if
she
identified
an
interested
and
eligible
buyer,
and
they
had
obtained
trpa
approval
of
the
transfer,
at
that
point
limitations
would
run.
if,
instead,
she
found
out
that
it
was
futile...
it
was...
with
a
good
faith
effort
there
was
no
market,
and
we
don't
think
that's
going
to
happen,
then
it
would
begin
running
at
the
date
of
the
reasonable
discovery
of
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
but
those
rules...
and
this
has
actually
been
litigated
and
settled,
at
least
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
for
a
1983
action
it's
quite
consistent,
and
mandated
by
this
court's
decision
in
wilson
v.
garcia,
that
there
is
a
uniform
limitations
period
for
all
1983
actions,
and
you
look
to
the
applicable
state
law,
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
nevada.
it
would
be
2
years.
so
it's
not
as
though
some
1983
actions
are
governed
by
the
60-day
in
article
vi
and
others
are
governed
by
nevada
law.
instead,
1983
actions
would
all
be
governed--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
one
of
the
factors
that
would
apply
in
a
case
like
this
is
the
penn
central
factor
and
the
economic
impact
of
the
regulation,
and
until
the
court
has
the
record
fleshed
out
to
make
the
proper
determination
of
the
economic
impact,
which
includes
the
value
of
the
tdr's,
the
court...
it's
just
a
matter
of
prudential
ripeness
considering
on
the
one
hand
the
relative
fitness
of
the
issue,
and
the
issue
simply
is
not
fit.
as
counsel
themselves
said,
they
viewed
this
whole
thing
as
a
mystery,
how
much
these
things
were
worth.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it's
different
from
the
present
case
because
of
the
uniqueness
of
tdr's.
in
a
case
like
that--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
the
landowner
shouldn't
have
to
wait
if
there
would
be
any
undue
hardship,
but
what
you
have
here
is
a
question
for
the
court.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
the--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--there
are
other
things
at
stake
here.
one
of
the
most
important
things
of
prudential
ripeness
is
the
fitness
of
the
issue
for
the
court
to
decide,
and
the
court
here
simply
wanted
to
decide
this
very
important
as-applied
takings
case
based
on
the
better
evidence
possible.
the
court--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--there
are
not
cases
involving
valuation.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
there
are--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
there
are
cases
involving
the
fact
the
court
wants
better
facts
before
it
to
decide,
like
the
whren
v.
geary
case,
the
first
amendment
case
i
believe
written
by
justice
kennedy
involving
a
first
amendment
challenge,
and
one
of
the
questions...
it
was
a
california
constitutional
provision
which
made
it
unlawful
for
a
political
party
to
endorse
any
candidate
for
non...
a
nonpartisan
office.
and
if
one
reads
the
court's
opinion
there,
one
of
the
things
the
court
is
concerned
about
there
is
that
until
they
have
an
actual
application...
they
can
see
what
the
pamphlets
are.
they
can
see
what
the
actual
hardship
would
be
on
the
political
party
in
that
case...
it
simply
really
wasn't
ripe
for--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
because
she
is
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
and
she
in
effect
created
the
factual
uncertainty
about
these
tdr's
which
prompted
the
lower
court
to
decide
that
it
needed
a
better
record
to
decide
the
case
than
it
had
before.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
we
created
the--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
the
rights
that
we
created,
though,
were
rights
which
were
very
consistent
with
fairness
and
justice,
and
that
is
in
this
case
we
were
striving--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
certainly
the
agency
has
an
interest
in
a
ruling
which
promotes
the
creation
of
this
market,
but
the
real,
more
concrete
interest
of
the
agency
in
this
case...
because,
of
course,
the
only
record
evidence
in
this
case,
the
only
appraisals
are
all
on
our
side.
our
interest
is
a
far
broader
interest,
and
that
is
to
have
these
applied
takings
challenges
based
on
the
best
record
possible.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it
would
have...
it
could
have
that
incidental
effect.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
your
honor,
that
is
an
incidental,
i
think
positive
effect
of
our
position,
but
i
think
the
main
impetus
of
our
position
remains
the
fact
that
it
is
in
the
government's
interest
always
to
have
the
constitutionality
determined
based
on
a
fully
fleshed-out
record.
now,
in
this
case,
perhaps
the
trial
court,
contrary
to
our
recommendation,
should
have,
relying
on
our
appraisals,
ruled
against
the
petitioner
on
the
merits.
the
irony
is
what
she
is
challenging
is
a
ruling
that
is
far
more
generous
than
that
which
is
in
effect.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i
believe
she's
82
years
old.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well--
[laughter]
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that
there's
been
hardship
here,
under
our
view
she
could
have
very
easily
made
this
case
ripe
consistent
with
the
district
court's
opinion
in
a
very
short
time.
the
delay
that
has
resulted
over
the
years
is
a
result
of
the
litigation.
now,
she
is
of
course
well
within
her
rights
to
appeal,
but
having
chosen
to
appeal,
you
can't
claim
hardship
on
the
valuation
based
on
the
time
that
it
took
for
the
appeal
when
the
case
could
have
been
very
easily
made
ripe
for
other
times.
i
can't
speculate
as
to
why,
given
the
age
of
the
petitioner,
one
chose
one
technique
rather
than
another
technique,
but
in
terms
of
hardship,
i
don't
think
one
could
put
the
litigation,
particularly
the
lengthy
appeal,
as
evidence
of
the
hardship--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--under
our
view,
she
basically
would
have
to
make
a
good
faith
effort.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
it's
a
lottery
that
we'd
all
like
to
apply
to,
your
honor.
based
on
the
record
evidence--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes,
well,
the
record
evidence
is
in
1993
there
is--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well...
well--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--because
everything
is
outside
the
record,
there
were
fewer
applicants
than
allocations.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
at
this
point
there
were
few...
in
washoe
county
there
were
fewer
applicants
than
there
are
allocations,
so
at
this
point
it's
really
not--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes,
and
even
if
there
wasn't,
your
honor,
because
obviously
this
could
vary
depending
on
the
county,
all
we're
asking...
all
we're
basically
urging
the
court
to
adopt
here
is
a
prudential
approach
which
would
be
looking
at--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--we
think
the
better
way
to
view
the
case
is
in
more
flexible
terms.
williamson
county
and
yolo
county
are,
after
all,
really
just
case-specific
applications
of
the
broader
principles
of
abbott
labs,
basically
concerns
with--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
and
that's
maybe
one
reason
why
we
think
the
better
way
to
view
the
case
is
in
more
flexible
terms.
if
i've
got
a
little
time,
i'd
like
to
spend
just
a
moment,
though,
on
petitioner's
broader
ripeness
argument,
which
is
simultaneously
less
persuasive
and
far
more
troublesome,
and
that's
petitioner's
argument
that
the
value
of
her
tdr's
is
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law
as
to
the
question
whether
this
property
has
been
taken.
we
really
think
that
that
argument
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
the
penn
central
case,
where
the
court
directly
faced...
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
directly
faced
the
question
of
the
relevance
of
tdr's
to
the
question
whether
the
property
has
been
taken,
and
the
court
squarely
held
that
the
value
of
tdr's
is
relevant
to
the
economic
impact.
thank
you.
