justice
david
h.
souter
do
i
understand
the
reasoning
of
the
courts
below
that
the
lack
of
ripeness
depended
not
only
on
the
fact
that
there
had
not
been
a
final
ruling
from
the
county
in
this...
with
respect
to
one
of
these
rights
that...
the
lottery
issue,
i
guess...
but
that
in
fact
with
respect
to
all
of
the
tdr's
collectively
there
was
simply
too
little
known
about
their
actual
functioning
to
assign
a
market
value,
and
because
a
market
value
could
not
be
supplied,
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
saying
that
the
claim
was
not
ripe.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
it's
your
position
that
even
if
the
value
of
the
credits
cannot
be
determined,
you
are
prepared
to
proceed
in
this
suit
and
take
whatever
consequences
that
fact
might
produce
for
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
you
would
say...
or
maybe
you
don't
say.
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
if
these
credits
have
no
market
value,
or
have
no
value
that
can
be
established,
that
that
in
a
sense
aggravates
the
taking
that
has
occurred
in
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
so
far
as
this
particular
proceeding
this
morning
is
concerned,
i
take
it
your
position
is,
even
if
you
lose
on
the
question
whether
the
tdr's
are
relevant
to
the
taking,
you
are
ready
to
litigate
them
for
whatever
they
are
worth,
and
you
just
want
to
proceed.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
didn't
see
anywhere
in
these...
i
haven't
read
yet
everything,
but
i
didn't
see
in
most
of
these
things
any
ground
that
the
authority
would
have
to
deny
approval,
assuming
that
she
transferred
the
rights
to
a
person
who
was
qualified,
which
any
other...
so
what's
left
to
do?
i
mean,
why
isn't
it
ripe
under
any
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
she's
been
told
at
a
certain
date
at
that
moment
you
cannot
build
on
this
property,
and
instead,
here
are
some
pieces
of
paper,
and
they
have
definite
rights
in
them,
and
there's
nothing
more
for
the
agency
to
do.
there's
nothing
for
the
agency
to
do.
the
legal
issue's
clear.
what
remains
under
abbott
laboratories
to
happen?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
are
creating
the
uniqueness.
i
mean,
you
are
supplying
the
ingredient
which
justice
scalia
referred
to
as
being
up
in
the
mountains
without
any
comparable
sales,
and
the
only
thing
that
is
unique
is
that,
in
creating
the
tdr
scheme,
you
have
created
the
problem.
why
should
the
landowner
have
to
wait
because
you
created
something
which
is
difficult
to
value?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can't
think
of
any
ripeness
case
i've
ever
read,
and
maybe
you
can
cite
one,
but
i
can't
think
of
any
ripeness
case
i've
ever
read
in
which
a
factor
like
this
made
a
difference.
i
mean,
because
of
what
justice
scalia
said.
the
agency
isn't
likely
to
change.
they're
not
going
to
change
anything,
and
of
course
it
would
be
a
little
easier
if
we
had
better
evidence
about
what
these
tdr's
are
worth,
but
is
there
any
case
which
said
because
you
can
get
better
valuation
evidence
later--
justice
david
h.
souter
--this
matter
isn't
ripe?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
anything
like
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
we
characterize
her
as
creating
the
uncertainty
when
it
was
your
agency
that
created
the
rights?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
blame
her
rather
than
your
client?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
kind
of
the
issue
here,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
may
i...
let
me
make
a
proposal,
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
and
why.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
agency's
interest
here
in
raising
the
ripeness
claim
and
in
defending
what
has
happened
below
is
simply
this,
that
if
the
valuation
does
proceed
right
now,
without
the
development
of
a
market
and
without
the...
any
further
action
by
the
petitioner,
an
appraiser
is
likely
to
come
in
and
say,
there
is
so
little
reason
for
me
to
ascribe
value
to
these
rights
that
i'm
going
to
ascribe
a
very
low
value
to
them.
i'm
going
to
say,
perhaps
not
that
they're
worth
less...
worth
nothing,
but
that
they
are
worth
very
little.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
only
interest
which
the
agency
has
in
delaying
this.
they
don't
want
a
low
valuation.
is
there
something
more
involved
in
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
seems
to
me
quite
manipulative
for
you
to
say
we
want
to
use
the
courts
to
create
our
market.
you
want
the
ruling
to
create
a
market?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
your
position
is
that
these
are
worth
something,
then
that
ought
to
be
a
market
that
you've
created
when
you
gave
her
the
coupons.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
also
one...
i'm
sorry.
i
think
there's
one
difference
between
the
williamson
situation
and
this,
and
that
is,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
in
the
williamson
situation
the
rights
which
the
property
owner
wanted
to
exercise
were
rights
which
came
to
the
property
owner
with
the
purchase
of
the
property,
but
they
were
simply
subject
to
a
government
limitation.
you
can't
do
this
unless
you
get
a
variance.
the
rights
that
we're
concerned
with
here,
however,
are
at
least
in
part
new
rights.
she,
for
example,
did
not
when
she
purchased
her
lot
get
a
right
to
have
somebody
else
build
so
many
square
feet
on
somebody
else's
lot.
that's
a
brand
new
creation,
and
so
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
why
the...
even
if
we
were
to
say
well,
this
is
a
williamson
case,
you
might
still
be
in
trouble
under
williamson.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they're
new
sticks
in
the
bundle,
at
least
some
of
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
an
easement
part
of
the
bundle
of
rights?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
had
two
parcels,
one
with
this
restriction
and
one
without,
which
person
has
the
bigger
bundle
of
rights?
it
seems
to
me
very
strange
to
call
this
part
of
the
bundle
of
rights.
