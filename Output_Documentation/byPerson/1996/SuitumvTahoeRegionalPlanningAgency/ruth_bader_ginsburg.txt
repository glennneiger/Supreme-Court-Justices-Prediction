but
there
was
an
affidavit
backing
that
up,
wasn't
there,
the
johnson
affidavit
that
said
this
property
has
some
residual
value?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
ninth
circuit
had
something
to
go
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
radford,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
you
recognize
that
the
only
thing
before
us
is
that
threshold
ripeness?
i
think
at
least
the
united
states
has
said
you
have
a
final
order,
you
have
a
final
decision,
and
the
only
question
is
this
prudential
ripeness
coming
out
of
abbott
laboratories.
that
was
the
united
states'
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lazarus,
on
a
question
of
evidence,
what
these
tdr's
are
worth,
it's
something
that
you
created.
the
landowner
really
wants
nothing
to
do
with
it,
and
one
of
the
considerations
when
we're
dealing
with
evidence
is
which
side
is
better
equipped
to
present
the
information.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
ms.
suitum
had
somebody
testify
and
that
person
was
rejected
as
not
a
proper
expert.
you
had
someone
who
did
qualify
as
an
expert,
so
even
if
the
record
needs
fleshing
out,
why
should
it
be
suitum
rather
than
the
agency
that
does
the
fleshing
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lazarus,
i
understand
the
ninth
circuit
didn't,
and
the
abbott
laboratories
is
a
new
creation,
and
you're
talking
about
balance
of
hardships.
that's...
the
ninth
circuit
thought
it
was
dealing
with
a
williamson-type
case.
it
was
just
like,
could
i
get
a
variance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
let
me
understand
what
you're
just
saying.
i
don't
know
that
any
judge
in
this
case
said
that
she
didn't
have
a
claim
on
the
merits.
i
thought
it
was
ripeness
at
both
stages.
