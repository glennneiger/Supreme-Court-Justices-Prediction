chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-243,
bernadine
suitum
v.
tahoe
regional
planning
agency.
mr.
radford.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
reach
any
takings
question,
did
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
said
that
under
hamilton
county
this
was
simply...
you
had
to
pursue
further
remedies
before
they
would
even
confront
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
trpa
subject
to
the
administrative
procedure
act?
has
any
court
ever
decided
that
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
radford.
mr.
lazarus,
we'll
hear
from
you.
i
hope
sometime
during
your
argument
you
will
comment
on
the
observation
i
am
about
to
make,
that
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
rely
very
heavily
on
the
williamson
v.
hamilton
county.
your
brief
here
kind
of
shifts
and
goes
to
abbott
laboratories.
is
that
really
a
shift
in
your
position,
or
a
chance
in
emphasis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
administrative
procedure
act
applies
to
the
trpa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
apply,
say,
abbott
laboratories
to
an
entirely
uni-state
proceeding
if
this
were
just
california?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
of
california
were
to
take
a
different
position
in
its
administrative
procedure
rulings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
is
governed
by
federal
law
in
this
respect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
tdr's
in
penn
central
were
different
in
that
they
went
to
property
already
owned
by
the
claimant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
they're
more
flexible,
but
they
also
strike
me
as
less
usable,
since
at
least
the
person
who
owned
the
property
that
the
tdr
applied
to
could
make
the
judgment
do
i
want
to
use
it,
rather
than
just
having
to
sell
it
to
somebody.
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is...
if
the
trpa
says
you
can't
use
your
lot
but
here's
some
scrip,
you
go
over
to
harrah's
and
you
can
play
roulette
with
it.
[laughter]
then
you
say
no,
we
don't
value
the
scrip.
we
have...
we
require
the
owner
to
stand
outside
the
door
of
harrah's
and
see
what
she
can
get
for
it,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wallace,
what
if
the
government
had
imposed
this
same
restriction
on
her,
and
instead
of
giving
her
tdr's
had
said,
we
have
another
piece
of
property
over
here
that
we
think
is
equal
to
the
value
we're
taking
away
from
you,
so
here
it
is.
now,
that
may
or
may
not
be
ripe,
but
surely
there's
not
a
ripeness
problem
there,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that's
what
this
case
involved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
didn't
treat
penn
central
as
a
ripeness
case
at
all.
it
treated
it
as
a
takings
case--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
said
there
was
no
taking.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
radford,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
