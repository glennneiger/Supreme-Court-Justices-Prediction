justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
does
the
charter
of
the
agency
give
them
eminent
domain
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
it
doesn't
go
to
the
taking
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
the
criterion
is
not
residual
value,
but
whether
there
is
any
economically
beneficial
use
of
the
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
one
is
included
in
the
other
only
if
the
way
that
you
resolve
the
first
is
by
resolving
that
these
things
have
no
value.
if
you
resolve
it
that
way,
then
indeed
the
lucas
question
is
answered,
but
if
you
resolve
it
the
other
way,
that
they
have
some
value,
then
it's
not
the
same
question,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
radford,
could
i
take
you
back
to
the
line
of
questioning
that
justice
o'connor
began
with?
you
said
that
none
of
these
tdr's
preexisted
the
asserted
taking
here.
that
is,
the
denial
of
the
building
authorization.
is
that
so?
i
thought
that...
is
it
not
the
case
that
any
lot
owner
in
this
area
could,
if
he
or
she
wished,
sell
that
lot-owner's
right
to
build
to
somebody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
well,
so
then
some
of
these
tdr's
did
preexist
the
asserted
taking
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
regulatory
scheme
is
not
the
taking.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
your
point
was
that
if
something
is
given
to
you
at
the
same
time
as
the
taking,
it
can
be
regarded
as
compensation,
but
it
in
no
way
reduces
the
amount
of
the
taking,
and
their
response
is,
yes,
but
you
had
more
than
just
your
ability
to
use
the
land
at
the
time
of
the
taking.
you
also
had
your
ability
to
trade
off
your
land
rights
to
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
for
some
of
them
that's
true.
i'm
not
sure
all
of
them.
i
think
some
of
them
you
only
acquire
after
you've
been
designated
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
your
rules
adopted
by
the
association
say
that
you
have
to
bring
suit
within
60
days,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lazarus,
suppose
there's
a
regular
inverse
condemnation
case,
and
the
plaintiff
is
saying,
you
took
my
land,
and
i
want
just
compensation.
do
you
think
that
the
state
that
took
the
land,
or
the
state
agency,
would
be
able
to
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
this
land
is
way
off
in
the
mountains.
there
hasn't
been
a
sale
in
that
area
in
50
years.
figuring
out
the
value
of
that
land
for
just
compensation
purposes
is
very
difficult.
this
suit
is
not
ripe.
the
owner
of
the
land
has
to
go
out
and
find
a
potential
buyer
at
some
cost.
why
is
that
any
different
from...
you
know
the
answer
to
that
is,
of
course,
the
suit
is
ripe.
why
is
that
any
different
from
the
present
case?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
inquire
into
hardship
in
that
case.
i've
never
heard
of
a
court
inquiring
into
hardship.
the
court
might
say
to
the
plaintiff,
look,
if
you
can't
prove
the
value,
you're
the
one
who's
going
to
be
the
loser,
but
if
you
want
to
go
ahead,
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
look
into
hardship.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
she
could
have
been
able
to
appeal
here
on
the
merits
question,
which
your
opposing
counsel
is
urging
us
to
reach
but
acknowledges
we
need
not
reach,
and
this
6
years
of
litigation
would
have
been
ended
that
much
sooner.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
just
adds
another
layer
of
litigation.
how
elderly
is
this
plaintiff,
if
we're
talking
about
hardship?
do
we
know
how
old
the
lady
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
she's
been
litigating
this
for
6
years
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
to
talk
about
hardship?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
she...
does
she
have
to
wait
till
she
wins
the
lottery?
what
if
she
doesn't
win
the
lottery?
how
is
that
one
to
be
evaluated?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
win
the
lottery?
justice
antonin
scalia
she
can
only
sell
that
particular
right
if
she
wins
the
lottery,
so
i
guess
she
would
have
to
keep
applying
until
she
wins,
and
then
try
to
sell
it
and
see
how
much
it's
worth,
and
then
maybe
you
discount
it
by
the
chances
of
winning.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
is,
it's
certainly
not
an
easy
thing
for
her
to
come
up
with
the
kind
of
evaluation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you're
talking
about,
and
she
had
no
reason
to
believe
you
were
going
to
be
generous
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--saying
never
mind
the
lottery.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
rely
on
abbott
labs.
[laughter]
abbott
labs
is
your
answer,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
abbott
labs
is
an
apa
case.
it's
also,
being
an
apa
case
it's
a
case...
and
a
case
seeking
an
injunction.
it's
a
case
bringing
one
of
the
prerogative
writs
so
that
the
court
is
sitting
with
all
sorts
of
equitable
powers,
and
can,
indeed,
decide
to
weigh
the
equities
and
so
forth.
this
is
not
an
equitable
case
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
this
case
is
moot.
i
don't
know
why
all
these
people
have
come
up
here,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
the
whole
dispute
was
about,
mr.
wallace.
