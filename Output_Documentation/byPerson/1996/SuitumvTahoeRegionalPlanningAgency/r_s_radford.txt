mr.
r.
s.
radford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
an
ordinary
property
owner
who's
been
denied
all
beneficial
use
of
her
land
and
then,
in
addition,
has
been
denied
access
to
the
courts
to
seek
relief
for
that
categorical
taking
of
her
property.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
well,
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency,
of
course,
is
a
bi-state
body
operating
under
an
act
of
congress,
and
the
type
of
proceeding
that
was
initiated
here
in
district
court
would
appear
to
be
specifically
authorized
under
the
trpa
compact.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
well,
i'm
afraid
that
i
can't
answer
that
question,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
does
your...
is
the
thrust
of
your
question
going
to
the
second
prong
of
williamson
county
regarding
the
need
to
pursue
state
remedies?
mr.
r.
s.
radford
well,
the
position
of
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
they
do
not
have
provisions
for
paying
just
compensation,
and
this
entered
into
the
decision
that
was
made
at
the
initial
level
of
this
litigation
to
proceed
by
way
of
federal--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--i'm
not
aware
of
such
a
practice,
certainly
not
routinely,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
no,
it
does
not,
justice
scalia.
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
here
this
morning,
if
i
could.
first,
the
opportunity
to
sell
development
credits
for
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
is
not
a
remaining
use
of
mrs.
suitum's
land
that
could
constitute
a
ripeness
bar
to
her
regulatory
takings
claim.
second,
the
monetary
value
of
those
credits,
which
was
the
sole
issue
in
dispute
in
the
proceedings
below,
has
no
relevance
to
the
ripeness
of
her
claim,
and
in
any
case
is
eminently
fit
for
adjudication
using
ordinary
appraisal
methods.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
true,
justice
o'connor.
the
monetary
value--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
made
a...
an
extremely
important
distinction
in
the
brief
that
was
filed
with
this
court.
i
believe
on
page
17
the
distinction
was
between
value
and
rights
that
were
retained
in
mrs.
suitum's
property
following
the
application
of
these
regulations
and
value
or
rights
that
were
obtained
from
the
agency
after
the
complete
deprivation
of
her
ownership
rights.
the
value
of
the
tdr's...
and
we're
going
to
use
shorthand
here.
when
we
talk
about
tdr's,
transferable
development
rights,
we're
talking
about
these
credits
that
the
agency
has
created.
their
value,
if
any,
is
something
that
has
been
injected
from
the
outside
after
all
of
mrs.
suitum's
development
rights
have
been
destroyed.
those
are
values
that
she
has
obtained
from
the
agency,
not
values
that
were
retained
by
her
property
and,
of
course,
when
you
look
at
it
that
way,
and
the
reason
that
distinction
i
think
is
valuable
is
it
illustrates
that
what
trpa
is
really
doing
here--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--the
tdr's
at
issue
in
penn
central,
justice
o'connor,
of
course
were
not
considered
relevant
to
the
ripeness
issue.
the
court
went
directly
to
the
merits.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
that...
that
would
appear
to
be
correct.
the
direct
answer
to
your
prior
question
is,
the
tdr's
that
were
at
issue
in
penn
central
were
preexisting.
they
were
not
created
by
the
landmarks
law
that
was
being
challenged
in
penn
central.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
i
could
not
tell
you
exactly
when
penn
central
purchased
the
property
involved
and
when
the
new
york
city
zoning
ordinance
went
into
effect,
but
the
tdr's
were
part
of
the
general
zoning
ordinance.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
the
agency
was
in
existence
at
the
time
mrs.
suitum
acquired
this
property
in
1972.
however,
the
credits
that
are
at
issue
here
were
only
created
under
the
1987
plan
that
came
along,
of
course,
considerably
after
mrs.
suitum
and
her
husband
had
acquired
this
lot
with
the
expectation
of
being
able
to
build
a
home.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
justice--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--i
would
disagree
with
that,
respectfully,
justice--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--well,
i
know--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--the
situation
that
we
have
here
is
an
ordinary
street
with
ordinary
homes
and
one
vacant
lot
in
the
middle
of
it.
it
might
be
a
suburb
of
milwaukee
or
sacramento.
it
happens
to
be
incline
village.
now,
you
have
two
houses,
obviously,
on
each
side
of
that
vacant
lot,
and
the
ninth
circuit
actually
says
this.
that
consists...
that
comprises
a
market
for
her
property,
because
either
of
those
two
neighbors
might
want
to
buy
that
as
an
extension
of
their
own
land.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
well...
however,
if
you
look
at
the
evidentiary
basis
for
that
affidavit,
there
were
no
comparable
sales.
there
has
never
been
a
sale
of
sez
property...
that
is,
property
that
the
agency
has
designated
a
stream
environment
zone...
to
an
adjacent
landowner.
mr.
johnson's
affidavit
cited
to
six
sales
which
were
an
attachment
to
that
affidavit,
every
one
of
which
was
a
sale
by
the
state
of
nevada.
there
has
never
been
an
arm's
length
private
transaction
between
the
owner
of
sez
property
and
an
adjacent
property
owner,
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
there
ever
would
be
one.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
it
would
presumably
go
to
the
issue
of
viability
for
a
taking,
justice
o'connor.
it
certainly
would
not
go
to
the
ripeness
question.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
no.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
well--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--that,
indeed,
is
our
position,
justice
scalia.
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical,
what
i
was
saying
is,
if
this
court
decides
that
there's
residual
value
in
the
property
and
decides
that
that
has
some
relevance
to
the
takings
question--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--that's
correct.
i'm
sorry
if
i
misrepresented
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
thrust
of
my
answer
was,
if
the
court
winds
up
in
the
position
of
saying
this
is
not
a
complete
wipe-out,
this
isn't
a
lucas-type
deprivation
of
all
beneficial
use
but
in
fact
is
a
penn
central
type
analysis
where
we
look
at
the
economic
impact
and
balance
various
factors,
then
that
would
become
relevant.
i
think
this
is
a
lucas
case.
i
think
if
we
were
to
get
to
the
merits...
and,
of
course,
all
the
ninth
circuit
actually
arrived
at
was
the
ripeness
issue...
if
we
were
to
get
to
the
merits,
i
think
this
is
a
lucas
case.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
no.
that's
not
necessary,
justice
kennedy.
what
we
need
to
prevail
in
this
case
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
simply
a
ruling
that
mrs.
suitum
has,
in
fact,
received
a
final
decision
within
the
meaning
of
williamson
county,
and--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--i
know
of
no
ruling
to
that
effect,
your...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
my
assumption
would
be
they
are
not
subject
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
which,
of
course,
applied
in
the
abbott
laboratories
case
that
trpa
now
seems
to
rest
its
ripeness
claims
on.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
justice
souter,
that
is
the
interpretation
that
trpa
places
on
the
decisions
below.
i
don't
read
that
myself.
in
the
proceedings
below
we
had,
of
course,
a
request...
or,
actually
an
order
from
the
district
court
for
a
supplementary
briefing
on
how
the
tdr
process
worked.
the
supplemental
briefs
and
affidavits
were
submitted,
and
among
the
material
that
was
submitted
in
that
process
were
affidavits
valuing
these
very
credits
that
are
at
issue.
mrs.
suitum
presented
valuation
evidence.
the
trpa
presented
valuation
evidence.
this
was
a
factual
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
trial
court
to
determine
in
response
to
its
order
for
supplemental
briefing,
and
yet
presented
with
this
evidence
that
both
sides
were
prepared
to
testify
and
present
experts
as
to
the
valuation
of
the
credits,
the
court
simultaneously
held
that
the
credits
have
value,
but
there's
no
way
of
knowing
what
that
value
is.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
justice
souter,
the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes.
mrs.
suitum
wants
to
build
her
house.
she
believes
that
she's
entitled
to
realize
her
reasonable
expectations
to
proceed
with
the
development
of
her
subdivision
lot
just
as
everyone
else
in
the
subdivision
has.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
that
would
be
correct,
justice
kennedy.
now,
there
seems
to
be
a
strange
dilemma
that's
presented
by
the
rulings
below,
and
that
is
clearly
either
there
is
a
market
for
the
tdr's
as
the
agency
has
contended
and
many
of
its
amici
contend
in
their
briefs
to
this
court...
either
there
is
a
market
for
the
tdr's
in
which
they
are
commonly
bought
and
sold,
in
which
case
the
court
could
easily
determine
the
value
by
appraisal,
or
there
is
not
a
market
for
them,
as
the
agency
has
contended
in
other
cases,
and
nobody
knows
what
they're
worth.
it's
a
total
mystery.
in
which
case,
it
would
obviously
be
completely
unfair
to
force
mrs.
suitum
to
go
out
and
try
to
test
a
market
that
doesn't
exist.
significantly,
i
think,
if
we
look
at
footnote
18
in
the
respondent's
brief,
the
bottom
line
to
all
of
this
is,
regardless
of
whether
mrs.
suitum
goes
out
and
goes
through
this
process,
tests
the
market,
gets
an
offer,
comes
back
to
the
agency
and
applies
for
a
sale
of
these
credits,
it's
the
agency's
position
that
the
court
should
still
make
up
its
own
determination
of
what
the
credits
are
worth.
so
there's
clear...
more
than
an
implication.
the
trpa
has
clearly
expressed
its
position
that
the
courts
can
determine
the
valuation
issue
completely
independently
of
anything
mrs.
suitum
is
required
to
do.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
our
basic
position,
justice
breyer,
is
that
although
the
value
of
the
credits
can
easily
be
determined
by
the
trial
court,
that
in
fact
is
irrelevant
to
the
taking
issue,
because
what
these
regulations
have
done--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--that's--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--that's
correct--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--your
honor.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
now,
i
would
have
to
add
that
this
is
an
extremely
unusual
case
in
that
the
substantive
issue
of
whether
there
has
been
a
lucas-type
taking
seems
almost
to
be
contained
within
the
procedural
issue
of
whether
the
case
is
ripe
for
adjudication.
this
came
up
on
ripeness.
the
question
presented
was
ripeness,
and
by
the
normal
procedures
of
this
court,
a
ruling
would
be
limited
to
ripeness.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
well,
there's
another
way
of
looking
at
it,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is,
the
ninth
circuit
held
the
case
was
not
ripe
because
the
opportunity
to
sell
these
tdr's
was
a
use
of
mrs.
suitum's
property.
if
we're
going
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
then
the
conclusion
could
only
be
that
the
opportunity
to
sell
the
tdr's
is
not
a
use
of
her
property--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--there--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--oh,
no,
justice
breyer.
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
we
are
not
suggesting
this
court
should
overrule
penn
central
or,
indeed,
should
overrule
any
previous
precedent.
our
position
is
the
existing
precedents
of
this
court
in
williamson
county
and
the
macdonald
case
are
clearly
consistent
with
a
ruling
that
this
case
is
ripe.
there's
been
a
final
adjudication
not
just
regarding
the
ability
to
utilize
her
land
which
was
involved
in
williamson
county
and
macdonald,
there's
also
been
a
final
determination,
as
you
just
said,
regarding
what
credits
are
available...
indeed,
what
credits
she
is
required
to
go
out
and
market.
so
there's
been
a
final
decision,
the
case
is
ripe,
that's
as
far
as
this
case
needs
to
go...
the
court
needs
to
go.
however,
the
court
could,
without
in
any
way
overruling
penn
central
or
any
other
case,
take
the
additional
step
of
saying,
since
the
ability
to
sell
these
credits
is
not
a
use
of
her
property,
she
has
no
beneficial
use
of
her
property.
the
regulations
have
deprived
her
of
all
beneficial
use.
because
everyone
agrees...
the
parties,
and
the
courts
below...
everyone
agrees
that
she
has
no
remaining
use
of
her
property
except
the
ability
to
sell
the
tdr's.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
i
think
that
would
be
a
taking,
justice
kennedy,
under
the
basic
standard
that
all
land
is
unique,
and
to
say
we're
going
to
take
away
the
land
that
you
own
in
which
your
expectations
are
wrapped
up
and
give
you
another
piece
of
land
would
in
fact
be
a
taking
with
an
offer
of
compensation.
now,
the
property
owner
might
accept
that
offer,
but
they
might
also
claim
no,
that
doesn't
comply
with
the
just
compensation
requirement.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
well,
i
would
agree,
justice
ginsburg,
that
actually
in
my
opinion
both
the
solicitor
general
and
the
agency
in
their
briefs
to
this
court
have
conceded
that
there's
been
a
final
decision
within
the
meaning
of
williamson
county.
now,
the
fallback
to
abbott
laboratories
i
think
is
completely
inappropriate
and
something
this
court
should
avoid.
abbott
laboratories
was
not
a
land
use
case.
it
wasn't
a
takings
case.
it
wasn't
even
a
constitutional
law
issue.
however,
if
we
were
to
look
at
the
abbott
laboratories
standards
we'd
see
that
the
basic
issue
in
abbott
laboratories,
determining
the
ripeness
of
a
preenforcement
challenge
to
federal
regulations,
is
whether
there
had
been
a
final
agency
action
that
imposed
a
distinct
injury
upon
the
plaintiff.
there
clearly
has
been
in
this
case.
in
fact,
that
would
seem
to
be
virtually
the
same
as
the
final
decision
requirement
in
the
specific
land
use
context
of
williamson
county.
what
the
agency
is
trying
to
do
with
abbott
laboratories
is
shoe-horn
its
argument
in
through
the
second
subsidiary
issue
of
hardship
on
the
parties
and
yet,
of
course,
the
hardship
inquiry
in
abbott
laboratories
was
not
a
balancing
test,
where
we
looked
at
the
hardship
on
the
plaintiffs
of
having
adjudication
delayed
versus
the
hardship
on
the
government,
whatever
that
would
mean,
of
having
a
prompt
determination
of
the
legality
of
its
regulations.
the
hardship
inquiry
applied
only
to
the
petitioners.
what
the
court
looked
at
is,
will
there
be
an
injury,
a
further
injury
to
the
petitioner
of
having
adjudication
delayed,
and
clearly
that
also
holds
in
this
case.
mrs.
suitum
stands
to
suffer
not
only
the
additional
losses
of
time
and
expense
of
continually
litigating
her
basic
constitutional
rights,
but
her
constitutional
claims
could,
in
fact,
be
mooted
out
if
she
complies
with
the
procedural
requirements
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
set
forth.
so
frankly
we
think
that
this
court
should
simply
reject
trpa's
proposal
to
proceed
with
an
abbott
labs
type
analysis,
look
at
williamson
county,
look
at
macdonald...
those
are
land
use
cases
involving
regulatory
takings
challenges.
the
point
of
the
takings
clause
is
fairness.
the
point
of
requiring
just
compensation
when
there
has
been
a
complete
wipe-out
of
all
beneficial
use
of
land
is
fairness.
the
point
of
the
ripeness
doctrine
is
certainty.
we
want
to
know
that
we
have
a
certain
claim.
we
want
to
know
that
the
regulations
have
been
applied
with
certainty
so
that
we
can
proceed
with
the
adjudication.
we
have
certainty.
mr.

within
the
many
restrictions
that
are
placed
on
the
transactions
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
perhaps
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor
was
misspoken.
my
point
was
that
the
tdr's
were
created
at
the
same
time
as
this
regulatory
scheme
that
trpa
has
placed.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
no.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
well,
we
have,
of
course--
mr.
r.
s.
radford
--that's...
that's
true.
of
course,
you
have
to
go
through
the
lottery
to
obtain
the
allocation.
you
get
the
bonus
residential
development
rights
but
only
if
you
sell
your
initial
right
and
greenbelt
your
property
and
so
forth.
but
the
sole
point
i
was
making
was
that
the
tdr's
at
issue
in
penn
central
existed
prior
to
the
whole
regulatory
scheme
of
the
landmarks
regulation.
it
was
part
of
the
comprehensive
zoning
plan
of
the
entire
city
of
new
york.
here,
by
contrast,
the
tdr's
were
created
at
the
same
time
as
the
regulatory
plan
under
which
it
was
finally
applied
to
mrs.
suitum,
giving
rise
to
this
taking.
the
point
being,
the
tdr's
at
issue
here
were
created
specifically
for
situations
where
these
regulations
will
deprive
an
owner
of
all
beneficial
use
of
their
land
and
then
go
through
an
ersatz
compensation
procedure
of
saying,
in
effect,
here,
you
have
some
paper.
we've
taken
away
all
of
your
property
rights
but
you
have
some
paper.
we
haven't
taken
that
away,
so
you
not
only
have
no
taking,
but
your
claim
isn't
even
ripe.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
r.
s.
radford
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court
i
have
nothing
to
add.
