mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
tdr's
under
this
plan
become
part
of
the
owner's
bandle
of
rights
that
are
connected
with
the
property.
the
market--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they're
new
sticks
in
the
bundle
which--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
could
be
if
it
were
transferable.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
if
she
were
to
sell
her
lot
to
a
new
purchaser
and
had
not
used
the
tdr's,
the
purchaser
would
get
the
right
to
use
the
tdr's
and
market
them,
and
therefore
the
market
value
of
the
lot
that
she
owns
reflects
the
value
of
the
tdr's.
this
is
not
some
separate
compensation
that's
been
given
to
her
personally.
it's
a
part
of
the
bundle
of
rights
that
goes
with
ownership
of
this
parcel.
this
was
an
effort
made--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
is
part...
in
takings
analysis,
in
regulatory
takings
cases
we
look
to
see
what
economic
value
has
been
retained
and
what
economic
value
has
been
taken,
as
well
as
the
purpose
of
the
regulation,
interference
with
reasonable
investment-back
expectations
and
the
rest
of
it.
what
she
retains
under
this
plan,
which
was
designed
to
mitigate,
in
accordance
with
this
court's
analysis
in
penn
central,
the
economic
burden
that
would
be
placed
on
these
environmentally,
sensitive
properties
where
no
further
development
on
the
property
itself,
no
further
impermeable
surfacing
could
be
permitted,
what
she
has
been
given
is
something
that
this
record
says
is
of
value
and
is
marketable
along
with
the
land
if
she
wants
to
sell
the
lot.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
ripeness
is
not
what
i
was
speaking
of
at
the
moment.
there
would
not
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
course
it
does,
and
i
wanted
to
get
to
that,
but
first
we
are
quite
concerned
with
the
per
se
takings
theory
under
which
they
are
arguing
that
it's
ripe,
because
it
seems
to
us
contrary
to
this
court's
jurisprudence,
not
only
directly
contrary
to
the
holding
in
penn
central
that
tdr's
count
in
the
takings
calculus
and
are
not
just
to
be
considered
part
of
compensation,
but
there's
a
reason
for
that
holding
that
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
tdr's
are
part
of
the
bundle
of
rights
that
an
owner
of
this
parcel
would
get.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
and
that
is
my
point,
that
the
court
held
there
was
no
taking,
and
part
of
the
calculus
was
that
the
value
of
the
tdr's
was
retained
by
the
owner,
and
was
something
that
contributed
to
market
value
remaining
in
that
parcel
of
property.
now,
in
approaching
the
ripeness
question
itself,
we
have
no
enthusiasm
generally
for
the
proposition
that
a
plaintiff
in
a
takings
case
who
fails
to
prove
her
case
should
get
a
second
bite
of
the
apple
and
be
able
to
bring
a
case
later
making
essentially
the
same
claim
if
better
evidence
can
be
produced,
so
it
was
with
some
hesitancy
that
we
supported
the
ripeness
argument
here
on
the
respondent's
side,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
true.
the
courts
below
did
not
reach
the
merits,
but
the
only
evidence
of
value
that
she
offered
was
excluded,
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
likely
outcome
if
this
case
is
held
to
be
ripe
is
that
the
respondent
has
introduced
sufficient
evidence
of
value
that
it
can't
be
said
that
she
has
shown
that
there's
a
taking.
the
model--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no
court
has
decided--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--$35,000,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
could
be
done.
what--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
what--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--she
is
seeking
very
similar
relief
in
some
of
her
claims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
she's
seeking
a
permit
to
build
on
this
lot.
she
is
seeking
equitable
relief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
would
not
be
harmful
to
our
interests
in
any
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
what
i--
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
said
that
we
think
there
has
been
a
final
decision
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
williamson,
and
perhaps
the
role
that
we
see
for
abbott
laboratories
can
best
be
hypothesized
if
at
the
outset
of
this
plan,
when
the
tdr's
were
brand
new
and
no
one
had
marketed
any
of
them,
every
owner
of
one
of
these
properties
went
directly
to
court
and
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
way
of
comparable
sales,
nothing
but
speculation
about
what
the
value
of
the
tdr's
would
be.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
was
an
effort
to
transform
part
of
the
bundle
of
rights
in
a
way
that
would
retain
a
substantial
measure
of
value
in
it.
those
responsible
for
governing
at
three
levels
here,
the
states
that
entered
into
the
compact,
congress,
and
the
planning
agency,
recognized
that
because
of
the
basin's
peculiar
ecological
fragilities,
further
development
on
these
parcels
located
in
these
sensitive
areas
could
not
be
permitted,
that
this
would
threaten
the
interrelated
environmental
and
economic
well-being
of
the
entire
basin.
and
so
they
tried
to
create
a
program
that
would
retain
a
substantial
measure
of
value
for
the
owners
of
these
parcels,
and
mitigate
any
loss
that
they
would
suffer
as
a
result
of
what
was
not
an
extraneous
restriction
being
placed
on
them
but
something
very
much
related
to
the
danger
that
their
development
would
pose
within
dolan
v.
tigard.
