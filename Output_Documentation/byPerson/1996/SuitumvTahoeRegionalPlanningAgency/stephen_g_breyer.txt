justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
right,
you
have
a
very
strong
argument
that's
final
and
definite.
so
then
we'd
say
it's
ripe,
go
decide
the
merits.
but
when
they
get
to
the
merits,
what
is
the
situation?
that
is,
my
impression
is
that
they've
been
through
the
merits
in
the
court,
that
there's
one
affidavit
in
there
that
says
that
these
things
are
worth
something...
i
don't
know
if
it's
$30,000...
several
thousand
dollars,
and
then
there's
another
affidavit
that
says
no,
they're
not
worth
anything.
that
was
struck
out
of
the
case,
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
so
if
we
send
it
back,
what
is
there
left
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words
you're
going
to
send
it
back
and
make
a
legal
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
legal
argument
will
be
on
the
basis
of
the
record
this
constitutes
a
taking,
and
the
other
side
will
say
on
the
basis
of
the
record
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
it
is
what
it
is.
i
mean,
that
is
to
say,
they
have
said
this
is
the
situation.
you
have
these
three
things,
the
180
feet,
the
allocation,
the
5-4
residential
rights...
that's
it.
you
got
it.
okay.
now
we
go
back
and
decide
whether
taking
a
person's
property
is
at
issue,
or
it
is
a
taking
under
those
circumstances
or
it
isn't.
what
is
there
any
need
for
us
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is,
why
should
we
overrule
a
holding,
what
looks
like
a
holding
in
the
penn
central
case
in
order
to
decide
a
ripeness
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it's
the
case
that
everybody
wins
this
lottery
after
4
or
5
years.
i
got
that
impression
from
reading--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there's
100
percent
chance
of
winning
the
lottery?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you...
could
you
answer
justice
o'connor's
question,
because
i
have
a
distinct
feeling
perhaps
the
answer
is
neither
the
government
nor
the
respondent
mind
if
this
court
were
to
say,
it's
ripe.
we're
not
expressing
any
view
on
the
merits...
none...
and
all
she
is
arguing
is
that
in
fact
under
these
circumstances
she
gets
definite
rights
of
tdr's
and
her
property
can't
be
built
on.
she
says
that
constitutes
a
taking.
the
other
side
says
it
doesn't.
now,
suppose
the
opinion
said
just
that,
would
the
government
object?
