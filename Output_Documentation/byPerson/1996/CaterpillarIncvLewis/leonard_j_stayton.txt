mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
today
asks
this
court
to
find
the
removal
was
proper,
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
removal
and
in
fact
did
not
exist
until
3
years
after
the
1-year
time
limitation
for
removal
under
1446(b)
had
expired.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
as
a
practical
matter
i
don't
do
a
whole
lot
of
work
in
federal
court
and
wasn't
intimately
aware
of
the
removal
statute.
i
think
the
1-year
limitation
is
tied
in
with
the
argument
that
was
raised
by
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
my
response
to
that,
your
honor,
if
you
want
to
follow
that
argument,
then
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
is
also
raised.
the
petitioner
never
raised
its
argument
that
it's
making
here
today
under
grubbs
and
finn
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
in
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
court
also
held
in
hanson
v.
denckla
that
in
cases
such
as...
or
in
arguments
such
as
the
petitioner
has
made,
that
if
it
fails
to
make
that
argument
in
the
court
below,
it
also
waives
that
argument
before
this
court.
the
removal
statutes
are
clear
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
must
be
present
at
the
time
of
removal.
today
i
ask
this
court
to
adhere
to
its
long
history
of
strict
statutory
construction
in
the
removal
area.
for
over
100
years,
this
court
has
held
that
there
must
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
removal.
in
addition,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
removal
statute
is
to
be
strictly
construed.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
well,
i
think
in
that
case,
since
the
defendant
has
the...
made
the
election
to
have
the
case
removed
to
federal
court,
it
would
have
waived
its
argument
that--
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
1447
states
that
if
subject
matter
jurisdiction...
if
at
any
time
before
judgment
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
found
not
to
exist,
then
it
will
be
remanded.
in
this
case,
the
argument
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
did
not
exist
was
raised
prior
to
the
time
of
judgment.
and
i
think
1447
would
predominate
on
that
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
well,
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
if
the
defendant
had
elected
to
choose
the
forum
by
removing
it
to
federal
court,
then
they
would
be
bound
by
the
district
court
judgments,
your
honor.
congress
has
repeatedly
sought
to
restrict
federal
jurisdiction
rather
than
expanding
such.
this
is
particularly
exemplified
in
the
present
case
where
congress
in
1988
placed
a
1-year
limitation
under
1446(b)
on
removal
of
cases.
this
statute
was
enacted
to
avoid
interference
and
disruption
where
significant
progress
had
been
made
in
the
state
case,
as
in
this
case.
the
statutes
are
clear
as
to
jurisdiction.
under
1332
there
must
be
diversity
at
the
time
of
removal,
and
this
court
has
held
as
far
back
as
1806
in
strawbridge
that
complete
diversity
is
required.
under
1446,
the
parties
have
30
days
to
remove
after
receipt
of
a
paper
showing
jurisdiction
exists,
but
no
more
than
1
year
after
the
suit
is
filed.
in
the
present
case,
diversity
jurisdiction
did
not
exist
until
4
years
after
the
suit
was
filed.
after
removal,
the
respondent
timely
filed
a
motion
to
remand
under
1447.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
i
don't
agree,
your
honor,
because
in
1447
the
court
specifically
stated
that
if
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
noted
to
be
absent
at
any
time
before
final
judgment,
then
the
case
shall
be
remanded,
which
i
believe
makes
a
mandatory
requirement
upon
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
--i
don't
agree,
your
honor,
because
1447
specifically
states
that
the
case
shall
be
remanded
if
there's
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
as
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
grubbs
has
an
important
difference.
i
think
grubbs
is
consistent
with
1447.
in
grubbs
there
was
no
objection,
and
in
fact,
no
one
noticed
that
there
was
not
jurisdiction
until
after
judgment.
so,
i
believe
that
is
consistent
with
1447
since
1447
specifically
states
that
prior
to
the
time
of
final
judgment,
if
the
court
notes
that
there's
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
it
shall
be
remanded.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
within
30
days
i
filed
a
motion
to
remand,
and
i
also
filed,
while
it's
not
provided
for
the
statute,
an
objection
to
removal.
so,
yes,
i
did
file
a
timely
motion
for
remand,
your
honor.
that
was
provided
for
in
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
i
believe
you
may
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
in
my
opinion,
the
congress
has
recognized
the
rights
of
the
states
to
determine
their
own
matters.
congress
has
to
recognize--
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
--i
don't
know
if
i
understand
your
question
completely.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
well,
i
believe
it
must
be
a
balancing
act
of
congress
with
regard
to
the
right
of
the
federal
judiciary
versus
the
state
judiciary,
your
honor.
and
this...
the
congress
has
recognized,
by
imposing
the
1-year
limitation
on
removal,
that
we
want
to
avoid
interfering
with
cases
that
have
progressed
in
state
court
through
a
substantial
amount
of
work,
as
in
this
case.
in
this
case
there
had
been
an
extensive
amount
of
discovery
in
the
state
court.
we
had
had
various
hearings
with
the
court.
in
fact,
the
case
had
proceeded
far
enough--
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
--that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
you
may
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
well,
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
statute
itself
which
specifically
states
that
if
there's
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
prior
to
judgment,
the
case
shall
be
remanded.
and,
of
course,
as
i've
stated,
this
court
has
consistently
held
for
over
100
years
that
the
statutes
are
to
be
strictly
construed.
so,
i
would
submit
that
as
the
reason
why
congress
has
elected
to
have
this
case
remanded
where
there
is
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
of
course,
i
would
also
point
out
that
non-appealability
is
not
limited
to
jurisdictional
errors,
but
is...
but
applies
to
all
errors
which
are
made
at
trial
as
normally
a...
any
error
at
trial
merges
with
the
final
judgment
under
1291.
this
court
has
consistently
held
through
the
years
that
one
appeals
from
the
final
judgment
rather
than
filing
an
interlocutory
appeal
which
this
court
has
held
is
an
exceptional
remedy.
the
petitioner
would
have
you
believe
that
allowing
the
judgment
to
stand
where
the
case
was
improperly
removed
was
harmless
error,
but
such
is
not
correct.
there
were
several
advantages
to
the
respondent
being
in
state
court
versus
federal.
one
of
the
most
important
was
that...
one
of
my
most
important
pieces
of
evidence
was
excluded
in
the
federal
court
due
to
the
differences
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and
interpretation
of
those
by
the
sixth
circuit
versus
kentucky
law.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
saying
if
diversity
had
existed
prior
to
the
1-year
limitation?
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
yes,
in
that
case
clearly
there
would
have
been--
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
--to
a
large
extent,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
well,
no.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
removal.
so,
i
agree
that
that
was
correct.
since
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
removal,
then
that
could
not
be
cured
as
the...
at
a
later
time.
mr.
leonard
j.
stayton
yes,
i
agree
that
they
were
correct
in
finding
that
the
case
should
have
been
remanded
due
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
time
of
removal.
the
petitioner
argues
that
newman-green
v.
alfonzo-larrain
would
allow
the
judgment
to
stand
under
a
harmless
error
theory,
but
that
is
not
applicable
here.
first
of
all,
newman-green
does
not
deal
with
removal.
newman-green
deals
with
two
specific
areas.
first,
the
question
of
28
u.s.c.
1653,
as
has
been
noted
today,
provides
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
amend
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction
but
not
defects
in
jurisdiction.
and,
second,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
they
could
dismiss
a
dispensable
party
under
rule
21
rather
than
remanding
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
court
to
do
so.
so,
in
looking
at
newman-green,
it
would
be
my
position
that
newman-green
does
not
have
any
bearing
upon
the
matter
at
bar
as
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
removal
but
merely
addresses
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
of
congress
and
a
rule
of
civil
procedure.
in
summary,
with
regard
to
this
argument,
i
would
submit
that
the
rule
of
this
court
has
been
clear
that
the
statutes
of
congress
are
to
be
strictly
interpreted,
and
i
would
ask
this
court
today
to
strictly
construe
the
statutes
and
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
be
affirmed
and
this
matter
be
remanded
to
the
state
court.
