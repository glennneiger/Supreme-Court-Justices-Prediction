suppose
in
this
case
that
the
removal
had
been
after
1
year,
or
suppose
a
hypothetical
case,
removed
after
1
year.
and
the
district
judge
for
some
reason
said,
well,
that
statute
is
discretionary.
he's
just
wrong
and
doesn't
remove
it.
can
that
ever
be
cured?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
complete
diversity
at
all
times.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
should
that
lead
to
a
reversal
on
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
the
equities
there
are
much
different.
there
there's
diversity
at
all
times.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
case
the
judgment
is
saved
only
because
something
happens
toward
the
end.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that
objection
was
well
taken...
and
it
was...
if
it
had
been...
if
the
district
judge
had
recognized
all
the
circumstances
in
the
case,
why
isn't
that
statutory?
diversity
is
statutory
in
large
part.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
the
case
isn't
before
us,
but
do
you
have
a
conclusion
as
to
what
the
rule
should
be
if
the
removal
is,
say,
a
day...
a
week
after
the
1-year
period
of
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
what
you're
saying
is
that
these
matters
basically
are
to
be
left
to
the
district
courts.
