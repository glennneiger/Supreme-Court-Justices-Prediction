we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
95-1263,
caterpillar,
inc.
v.
james
david
lewis.
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
geller.
mr.
stayton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
familiar
with
our
rule
15,
mr.
stayton?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
if
you
don't
raise
it
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
it
will
be
deemed
waived...
it
may
be
deemed
waived?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the...
did
the
court
of
appeals
make
any
response
other
than
just
a
denial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
rule
15
deals
with
our
own
treatment
of
a
case,
not
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
as
you
agree,
i
take
it,
if
you
don't
raise
something
like
that
in
a
brief
in
opposition,
we
may
be
taking
a
case,
as
justice
scalia
says,
which
has
something
that
will
prevent
us
from
reaching
the
issue
that
the
petitioner
presents.
and
it's
your
obligation
to
point
that
out
to
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
not
suggesting
that
would
happen
even
without
a
motion
to
remand,
are
you?
i
mean,
grubbs
certainly
covers
that,
that
in
the
absence
of
objection,
if
there's
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
judgment,
that's
the
way...
that's
sustained.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
then
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
then
you
don't
agree
or
support
the
reasoning
used
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
this
case
in
your
favor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
do
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
reasoning?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stayton.
mr.
geller,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
geller.
the
case
is
submitted.
