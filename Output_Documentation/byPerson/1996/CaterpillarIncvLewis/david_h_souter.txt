h.

what
you
are
assuming,
it
seems
to
me,
and
might
have
said
to
justice
ginsburg
is
that
although
the
statutory
error
in
one
sense
exists
forever,
the
only
real
interest
that
is
at
stake
here
is
an
article
iii
jurisdictional
interest.
and
if
an
article
iii
jurisdictional
interest
gets
cured,
then
the
statutory
error
becomes
de
minimis,
and
given
the
interests
in
economy
and
so
on,
it
isn't
worth
reversing.
isn't
that
the
nub
of
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
geller,
on
your
reasoning
it
wouldn't
have
mattered
even
if
there
was
no
diversity
jurisdiction
during
trial.
so
long
as
it
had
attached
by
the
time
of
judgment,
that
would
be
enough.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
can
be
cured
after
appeal--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
i
would
suppose
it
would
follow
that
if
it
was
cured,
let's
say,
after
trial
but
at
some
point
prior
to
a
remand
on
appeal,
it
would
be
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
if
the...
if
you
do
take
the
position
that
so
long
as
it's
cured
even
after
trial
but
before
judgment,
does
it
follow
that
any
of
the
claims
of
harm
here,
if
we
should
get
to
a
harmful
error
analysis,
really
would
be
beside
the
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
would
be
inappropriate
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
had
raised
it,
would
you
be
standing
here
saying,
you're
right,
you
got
to
wipe
it
all
out,
send
it
back,
try
it
in
another
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that
is
so,
and
it
appears
to
be
so,
why
should
that
be?
in
other
words,
what
would...
what
do
you
think
the
congressional
policy
might
be
to
support
that
difference
in
treatment
depending
on
whether
the
remand
motion
is
granted
improperly
or
denied
improperly?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
this
isn't
a
matter
of
the
rights
of
states.
it's
a
matter
of
a
determination
by
a
federal
court.
and
why
does
one
determination
which
is
erroneous
get
a
different
treatment
from
the
converse
determination
which
is
erroneous?
i
mean,
what
do
you
think
the
congressional
policy
is
supporting
that
difference
in
treatment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the
remand
motion
is
granted,
there's
no
appeal.
if
the
remand
motion
is
denied
and
is
in
error,
there
can
be
appeal.
it
might
be
a
discretionary
appeal
immediately,
and
in
any
case
if
the
party
wishes
to
appeal,
feels
the
same
way
after
judgment,
there
can
be
an
appeal
then,
at
least
in
theory.
why
do
you
think
that
difference
in
treatment
has
been
provided
by
the
statutory
scheme?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
can't
even
get
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
the
case...
in
the
instance
in
which
it's...
the
remand
motion
is
improperly
granted.
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
you
think
the
distinction
and
that
one
good
argument
might
be
for
the
disparity
of
treatment
is
that
what
congress
was
really
concerned
about
was
the
fear
that
a
federal
court
might
he
exercising
article
iii...
or
be
purporting
to
exercise
jurisdiction
when
it
had
no
article
iii
diversity
jurisdiction
and
that
that's
the
reason
for
the
diversity?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that
is
correct,
then
doesn't
it
follow
that
if
that
article
iii
jurisdictional
problem
is
cured
before
judgment,
that
there
should
not
be
a
reversal
on
appeal
for
the
fact
alone
that
prior
to
judgment
at
some
time
there
was
an
article
iii
problem?
in
other
words,
you
lose
on
that.
if
that's
the
policy,
don't
you
lose?
