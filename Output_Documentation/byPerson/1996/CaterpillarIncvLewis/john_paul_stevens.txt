you
don't
mean
it's
precisely
like
the
finn
case.
it's
precisely
like--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
way
you
interpret
a
sentence
in
the
finn
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
should
be
relying
on
the
cases
that
sentence
cites,
except
they
all
went
the
other
way.
they
all
were
cases
where
the
defendant
was
not
allowed
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--take
advantage
of
the
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
relying
on
a
sentence
in
finn,
not
the
holding
in
finn.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
certainly
not
the
holding
because
the
case
went
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stayton,
would
you
agree
that
if
the
1-year
period
had
not
run
and
therefore
you
would
presume...
by
the
time
there
was
complete
diversity
and
you
would,
therefore,
presume
that
the
defendant
would
have
made
a
new
removal
motion
within
the
1-year
period,
that
then
the
error
would
be
harmless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
1-year
problem
in
the
case
really
goes
to
the
harmless
error
argument.
