well,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
this,
and
he
made
a
timely
objection.
he
preserved
his
objection.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
don't
know
if
it's
all
that
clear
whether
an
interlocutory
appeal
would
ever
lie
at
that
point,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
any
event,
presumably
having
made
the
objection
and
motion
in
a
timely
fashion,
it
should
be
reserved
for
review
on
appeal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
of
course
the
claim
is
that
there
was
prejudice
here
because
of
different
rules
on
what
evidence
can
come
in
and
because
of
the
non-unanimous
jury
in
kentucky
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
any
of
those
procedural
rules
at
the
state
level
could
ever
amount
to
prejudice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we
take
the
case
in
the
posture
that
there
was
an
error
when
it
wasn't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--sent
to
state
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
you
admitted
in
response
to
my
question
that
some
errors
could
be
prejudicial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
i
asked
you,
and
that
means
that
there
are
some
situations
that
would
permit
the
conducting
of
a
harmless
error
analysis.
