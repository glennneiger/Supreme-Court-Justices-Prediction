justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
was
right
at
that
point,
was
he
not,
because
whayne
was
still
in
the
litigation.
so,
when
the
motion
was
made
to
remand
to
state
court,
there
was
not
complete
diversity--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
case
should
have
been
remanded.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
geller,
is
it
not
true
this
case
has
an
unusual
feature?
if
i
understand
the
facts
correctly,
you
removed
very
close
to
the
1-year
limit
for
removal
in
a
diversity
case,
and
if
you
had
waited
until
whayne
was
dismissed,
at
the
point
at
which
you
had
complete
diversity,
it
would
have
been
too
late
for
you
to
remove.
so,
but
for
the
removal,
the
wrongful
removal
when
there
was
not
complete
diversity,
you
never
could
have
gotten
into
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
there
was
no
diversity
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
objection
that
was
made
was
that
there
was
not
complete
diversity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
well-taken
objection
and
you
recognized
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
must
accept
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
purposes
of
posture
we're
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
point
is
simply
that
if
you
had
waited
until
whayne
was
dismissed
from
the
action,
it
would
have
been
too
late
for
you
to
remove.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
other
point
i
was
glad
to
hear
you
say
in
your
argument
is
that
you
were
not
relying
on
the
failure
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--from
the
refusal
to
remand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
find
that
an
extraordinary
argument,
if
you're
making
that,
because
1292(b)
is
an
exception
to
the
very
firm
final
judgment
rule,
and
people
aren't
penalized
for
failing
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
it's
my...
if
1292
was
not
something
that
any
litigant
must
use...
and
it's
my
understanding
that
it
is
not...
then,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
a
timely
objection
was
made
and
that
objection
is
preserved
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--appeal
after
final
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
geller,
what
wasn't
completely
cured
was
that
there
was
a
removal
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
statutory
right
to
a
removal.
what
you're
asking
us,
i
think
if
i
get
you
right,
is
pretend
that
this
case
had
been
filed
anew
in
the
federal
court
before
the
trial.
this
was...
once
whayne
was
dropped
out,
there
was
complete
diversity,
and
i
could
understand
an
argument
that
says
take
the
case
at
that
point.
but
i
cannot
understand
an
argument
that
says
1292(b),
you
didn't
use
that,
so
you
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you're
losing
out
on
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
an
error
in
removing
the
case
when
there
wasn't
complete
diversity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
district
court...
if
we
could
just
peel
away
what
should
not
be
in
the
dispute
and
then
argue
from
there.
the
case
was
removed
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
right
to
remove
it
because
there
was
no
complete
diversity.
there
was
a
motion
to
remand
and
that
motion
to
remand
was
incorrectly
denied
because
a
nondiverse
party
was
still
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
could
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--say
that
that's
a
given--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
go
on
from
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
one
exception.
the
1-year
period
for
removal
was
not
on
the
scene
at
the
time
of
finn.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller,
then
i
will
say
it
one
more
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
had
waited
until
it
was
proper
to
remove,
you
could
not
have
removed
because
the
1-year
period
would
have
run.
if
you
had
done
it
right,
if
you
followed
the
statute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
didn't
try
to
remove
until
you
had
complete
diversity,
you
could
not
have
removed
because
the
one--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
difference
in
finn
is
that
1-year
provision
was
not
part
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
finn.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
it
was
satisfied
here
and
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
if
you
had
not
removed
at
a
time
when
there
wasn't
complete
diversity,
you
could
have
not
have
removed
later.
that's...
and
that's
part
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
scene
and
i
don't
think
it's
genuinely
arguable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller,
do
you
see
a
difference
between
a
plaintiff
who
prevails
in
such
a
case,
the
plaintiff
not
having
brought
the
case
to
the
federal
court,
and
the
defendant...
the
plaintiff
was
the
one
who
was
resisting
removal
because
the
plaintiff
doesn't
remove.
a
defendant
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
when
a
defendant
removes
and
the
removal...
there
was
no
basis
for
the
removal
at
the
time?
isn't
that
a
difference
in
the
situation
of
the
plaintiff
who
is...
doesn't
want
to
be
in
federal
court
but
is
stuck
there
because
the
defendant
dragged
the
plaintiff
there?
plaintiff
can
hang
on
to
the
plaintiff's
verdict,
but
that
you're
not
going
to
allow
a
defendant
who
wrongfully
removed
to
profit
from
that
wrongful
removal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
that
because
the
plaintiff
has
a
choice
of
forum.
a
plaintiff
suing
two
defendants
can
drop
one
of
them
at
any
time
and
perfect
the
diversity.
isn't
there
a
provision
that
says
you
can
cure
a
jurisdictional
defect
even
in
the
court
of
appeals?
isn't
there
a
provision
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
is
there
not
a
provision
in
title
28
to
that
effect,
that
you
can--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
can
cure
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
remember
the
number
of
it,
but
i
think
you
will
find
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
such
a
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
it's
the
plaintiff...
isn't
there
this
difference,
mr.
geller?
the...
our
system
gives
plaintiff
the
initial
choice
of
forum,
and
here
is
a
plaintiff
in
our
case
who
chose
a
state
court,
got
dragged
out
of
that
state
court
and
into
a
federal
court.
there
is
a
difference
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller,
wouldn't
28
u.s.c.
1653
take
care
of
your
newman-green
case,
which
you
say
is
just
like
that
one?
that
says
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction...
and
it's
the
plaintiff
who
alleges
jurisdiction
in
that
case...
may
be
cured
upon
terms
in
trial
or
appellate
court.
so,
the
plaintiff
says,
here's
my
allegation
of
jurisdiction.
it
was
defective.
i'm
now
amending
it.
that
applies
to
16...
to
plaintiff's
case.
it
wouldn't
apply
to
a
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh.
i
thought
you
told
me
that
there
was
only
the
rule
in
the
case
and
there
was
nothing
in
title
28.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stayton,
how
far
do
you
carry
that?
suppose
your
client
had
won
instead
of
lost
in
the
district
court
and
then
the
defendant
had
said
just
what
you're
saying
now,
ah,
but
there
was
never
any
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
so
we
have
to
wipe
it
all
out,
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court.
would
you
be
saying,
yes,
that's
right?
there
was
never
any
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
something
the
court
has
to
raise
on
its
own
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
did
make
a
timely
motion
to
remand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
may
be
that
congress
wanted
cases
remanded
to
the
state
court
to
be
left
there,
but
didn't
have
the
same
attitude
about
keeping
a
case
in
the
federal
court
that
shouldn't
be
there.
