i
would
think
that
your
argument
is
not
that
it's
statutory
versus
non-statutory,
but
rather
that
it's
curable
versus...
or
rather,
that
its
noncurable
versus
curable.
justice

scalia
if
you're
late,
you're
late
and
there's
no
way
that
it
can
ever
be
made
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas,
if
there
is
no
diversity,
that
can
be
altered.
justice
antonin
scalia
1653
applies
only
to
allegations
in
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
defective
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
the
basis
for
justice
kennedy's
dissent,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
newman-green,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
dissent
was
since
congress
felt
it
necessary
to
explicitly
provide
for
amending
even
a
defective
allegation
of
jurisdiction,
it
would
seem
clear
that
defective
jurisdiction
cannot
be
amended,
there
being
no
statute
providing
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
pretty
good
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
that
latter
point
goes,
when
we
granted
certiorari
in
the
case,
we
didn't
know
that
that
was
an
issue,
and
i
doubt
whether
we
would
have
granted
certiorari
to
decide
an
issue
that
is
so
narrow;
that
is
to
say,
if
you
remove
within
the
time
period,
but
that
removal
is
invalid,
can
a
later
remedying
of
the
jurisdictional
defect
preserve
the
judgment.
that's
a
very
narrow
question.
how
many
cases
are
there
going
to
be
where
this
occurs?
so,
you
raise
this
new
point
now
after
the
case
is
in
front
of
us
and
are
asking
us
to
decide
a
very,
very
narrow
case.
i
thought
we
were
going
to
decide
the
much
broader
case
of
whether
when
the
removal...
whether
done
before
or
after
the
1-year
limitation
is
applied,
when
that
removal
is
wrong
and
the
trial
court
doesn't
realize
it,
and
the
case
proceeds
to
judgment,
the
judgment
is
nonetheless
to
be
sustained.
but
you're
asking
us
to
decide
a
very
narrow
case
now,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
you
do
that
when
the
petition
was
filed
instead
of
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stayton,
let
me...
this
case
seems
to
me
almost
an
a
fortiori
case
of
newman-green
in
this
respect.
newman-green
did
not
involve
the
removal
provisions
we're
talking
about
here,
and
in
the
area
of
removal,
congress
has
displayed
in
the
statutory
scheme,
it
seems
to
me,
the
determination
that
bygones
will
be
bygones.
we
don't
want
to
appeal
this
removal
decision.
isn't
it
the
case
that
if
the
district
court
improperly
denies
removal
and
sends
it
back,
appeal
does
not
lie
from
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
indicate
that
congress
wants
this,
more
than
the
normal
suit
that's
involved
in
newman-green,
to
be
an
area
where
this
matter
is
taken
care
of
at
the
district
court?
yes,
they'll
get
it
wrong
sometimes,
but
it's
not
an
important
enough
matter
that
if
they've
gotten
it
wrong,
we
want
to
review
it
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
but
that's
of
necessity.
you
cannot
render
a
judgment
when
you
have
no
jurisdiction.
but
assuming
jurisdiction
exists,
it
seems
to
me
the
scheme
is
one
in
which
bygones
are
bygones.
