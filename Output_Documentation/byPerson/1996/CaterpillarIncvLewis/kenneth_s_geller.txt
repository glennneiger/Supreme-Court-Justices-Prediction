mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
not
because
of
any
error
in
the
district
court
proceedings,
and
not
because
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
try
this
case,
but
solely
because
the
district...
the
case
was
not
within
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
removed
from
state
court.
because
this
ruling
conflicts
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
makes
no
sense
from
the
standpoint
of
judicial
economy,
we've
asked
the
court
to
grant
review.
now,
the
facts
that
are
necessary
to
understand
the
legal
issue
are
these.
the
plaintiff,
james
lewis,
was
injured
while
operating
a
bulldozer
manufactured
by
caterpillar
and
serviced
by
whayne
supply
company.
he
brought
suit
in
kentucky
state
court
against
caterpillar
and
whayne
supply
alleging
a
number
of
tort
claims.
liberty
mutual
insurance
group
which
had
paid
lewis
worker's
compensation
benefits
intervened
as
a
plaintiff
to
protect
its
subrogation
rights
and
brought
virtually
identical
tort
claims
against
caterpillar
and
whayne
supply.
now,
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
case
was
not
removable
to
federal
court
because
both
plaintiff
lewis
and
defendant
whayne
supply
were
citizens
of
kentucky,
so
there
wasn't
complete
diversity
of
citizenship.
several
months
later,
however,
caterpillar's
counsel
learned
that
lewis
had
settled
his
claim
with
whayne
supply,
the
non-diverse
defendant,
and
caterpillar
thereupon
removed
the
case
to
federal
court
in
kentucky.
lewis
moved
to
remand
the
case,
making
the
single
argument
that
the
district
court
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
lewis--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
was
obviously
a
disputed
issue,
but
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
he
made
a
motion
to
remand.
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
from
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
remand?
the
sixth
circuit
and
other
circuits
have
allowed
appeals
in
that
circumstance.
we
don't
rely
heavily
on
that
in
this
case,
but
there
are
many
cases
that
have
allowed
appeals
in
that
circumstance,
including
some
cases
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
we
cited
in
our
brief.
but
it
would
be
a
discretionary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
the
error
had
not
been
cured,
i
think
there
would
be
an
argument
that
the
issue
should
be
reserved
for
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
if
the
error
had
been
objected
to
and
not
cured,
which
is
not
our
case,
i
think
there
is
an
argument
that
the
issue
might
be
reserved
to
be
argued
on
appeal
from
a
final
judgment,
and
if
the
error
is
consequential,
could
lead
to
a
reversal.
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
error--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
error,
justice
o'connor,
was
simply
in
removing
at
a
time
when
there
wasn't
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
just
like
this
court's
case,
as
i
hope
to
discuss
in
a
few
minutes,
of
finn
where
the
identical
error
occurred,
and
yet
the
court
said,
as
i'll
explain,
that
the
rule
is
even
though
that
error
may
have
occurred,
if
jurisdiction
exists
at
the
time
of
judgment
in
the
district
court,
that's
not...
there's
no
ground
to
reverse
on
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that's
true,
but
there
are
a
number
of
responses.
to
begin
with,
justice
ginsburg,
we
did
remove
prior
to
the
1-year
period.
there's
no
dispute
about
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
understand
that.
there
may
be
a
separate
question,
one
the...
once
the
case
is
in
federal
court
whether
it
should
have
been
remanded
for
lack
of
diversity,
but
there's
no
dispute
that
the
1-year
period
was
satisfied.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
secondly,
that
objection
was
never
made
in
the
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
was
the
only
objection.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
true.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we're
not--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we're
not
arguing
a
waiver
in
that
sense.
we're
not
arguing
that
the
lewis'
case
would
any...
be
any
better
today
if
he
had
tried
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
1292(b)
certification
had
not
been
granted.
what
we
do
say,
what
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
said,
is
that
these
are
the
sorts
of
errors
that
should
be
resolved
prior
to
trial.
he
had
the
opportunity.
he
had
one
more
step
to
take
prior
to
trial
in
which,
if
it
had
been
successful,
would
have
gotten
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
not...
it's
not
a
question
of
penalizing
anyone,
justice
ginsburg.
we're
simply
saying
that
that
was
a
remedy
available
to
lewis
that
he
didn't
pursue.
now--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
only
objection
that
was
made
in
the
motion
to
remand,
justice
ginsburg,
was
that
there
wasn't
diversity
jurisdiction.
it's
precisely
like
this
court's
finn
case,
which
i
hope
to
discuss
in
a
minute.
and
in
finn,
this
court
held...
and
it
has
been
the
rule
for
50
years...
that
even
if
there
wasn't
jurisdiction
at
the
time
the
case
was
removed
from
state
to
federal
court,
if
jurisdiction
subsequently
attaches
during
the
trial,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
first
of
all,
that
wouldn't--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--right.
it
would
be
a--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
would
be
a
statutory
error.
it
would
be
in
the
nature
of
filing
a
suit
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired.
if
it
would
have...
if
that
objection
had
been
preserved
and
if
the
error
had
never
been
cured
or
could
not
be
cured,
it
is
something
that
perhaps
would
lead
to
a
reversal
on
appeal.
it's
not
something--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--in
that
case,
though,
there
would
be
a
statutory
error,
and
the
question
would
be,
is
the
statutory
error
something
that
should
lead
to
a
reversal
on
appeal?
we
don't
have
a
statutory
error
here.
the
only
error
that's
complained...
that
was
complained
of
in
the
motion
to
remand
was
the
lack
of
diversity
jurisdiction
at
the
time
the
case
was
filed.
no
separate
statutory
violation
was
alleged.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
only
requirement
of
the
removal
statute
that
would
be
implicated
is
that
there
be
diversity
jurisdiction
or
some
other
ground
of
federal
jurisdiction
at
the
time
the
case
is
removed,
but
it's
not
a
separate
requirement
of
the
removal
statute.
it's
a
requirement
of
1332.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
it
would--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
would
still--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
that's
right.
and
there
may
be
some
statutory
errors
that
are
curable,
and
even
if
they're
not
curable,
justice
scalia,
they
may
be
harmless
errors.
i
mean,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
you
wouldn't
want
to
reverse
a
federal
judgment
even
though
some
error
may
have
occurred
at
some
earlier
part...
point
in
time,
but
we're
not
dealing
with
an
error
that's
not
curable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
i
guess
our
position
would
be
that
these
sorts
of
errors
should
be
the
subject
of
a
motion
to
remand
in
the
district
court,
and
that's
where
the
plaintiff's
remedy
is.
presumably
in
99
percent
of
all
cases,
the
district
court
will
grant
those
motions
if
they
deserve
to
be
granted.
if
they
are
not
granted,
if
the
opportunity
to
seek
an
interlocutory
appeal
is
not
taken,
if
the
case
then
goes
to
judgment
in
federal
court
and
it's
a
perfectly
valid
judgment
in
all
other
respects,
i
think
there's
a
strong
argument
that
that
judgment
should
not
be
reversed
because
of
that
error.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
these...
this
may
be
a
category
of
error
in
which
the
plaintiff's
remedy,
even
if
it's
not
cured,
would
be
with
the
district
judge
and
you
wouldn't
want
to
reverse
a
federal
judgment
based
on
them.
but
i
have
to
repeat
again
because
it
seems
to
me
so
critical
to
this
case
that
we're
dealing
here
with
an
error
that...
not
a
statutory
error
and
was
completely
cured
and
seems
to
us
to
be
on
all
fours
with
the
finn
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
justice
ginsburg,
we're
not
relying--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
we're
not
relying,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
on
the
failure
to
take
a
1292(b)
appeal
here
except
to
suggest
that,
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
these
are
the
sorts
of
errors
that
should
be
resolved
prior
to
trial.
this
is
one
more
way
in
which
he
could
have
resolved
it
prior
to
trial
and
he
didn't
pursue
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
would
be
the
nub
of
what
we're
saying
if
there
was
in
fact
a
statutory
error
here,
but
there
wasn't.
i
have
to
repeat.
i'll
try
to
come
to
this
later
on.
the
removal
petition
was
filed
prior
to
the
1-year
period
of
the
statute,
so
there
wasn't
a
statutory
error
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
was
the
only
error,
the
jurisdictional
error.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
the
fact.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
and
that's
precisely
right,
justice
ginsburg,
but
it
seems
to
me
all
of
those
things
could
have
been
said
and
more
said
in
the
finn
case.
this
court's
decision
in
american
fire
&
casualty
v.
finn
involved
precisely
the
same
situation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
wasn't
but...
i'll
say
it
one
last
time
and
then
we
can...
that
1-year
provision
was
not
violated
in
this
case.
the
removal
petition
was
filed
less
than
a
year.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
okay.
[laughter]
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
true.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
first
of
all,
even
assuming
there
was
this
distinct
statutory
error,
apart
from
the
jurisdiction
error,
it's
not
an
error
that
the
plaintiff
has
ever
alleged
or
preserved
until
his
merits
brief
in
this
court.
he
didn't
allege
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
didn't
allege
it
in
the
response
to
the
rehearing
petition
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
didn't
allege
it
in
his
brief
in
opposition
in
this
court.
so,
the
very
first
time
we're
hearing
about
this
1-year
provision
is
in
the
merits
brief
in
this
court
now.
so,
i...
we
have
really
two
arguments.
one
is,
his
argument
was
never
preserved.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
no,
it
wasn't,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
time
we
see
this
1-year
argument
is
in
the
merits
brief
in
this
court.
we
don't
think
it's
preserved.
but
secondly,
the
1-year
provision
was
put
in
the
statute
like
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
simply
says
you
have
to
file
the
removal
petition
within
a
year.
that...
i
think
it's
undisputed
that
that
requirement
was
satisfied
here.
take
a
case
like
newman-green
which
is
a--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
so,
there
wasn't
a
statutory
error.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
accept
that
point.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
fine.
i
agree.
in
any
event,
this
case
we
think
is
precisely
like
finn
where
the
court
stated
a
rule,
which
it
repeated
more
recently
in
grubbs,
that
even
if
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
at
the
time
that
a
case
was
removed
from
state
to
federal
court,
the
judgment
should
not
be
reversed
on
appeal
if
in
fact
federal
jurisdiction
was
present
at
the
time--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--like
the
rule--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
except
what
happened
in
finn,
justice
stevens,
it's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
there
are
a
lot
of--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
rule
announced
in
finn...
it's
true
that
in
finn
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
believe
we
can
debate
whether
it's
the
holding.
it
was
the
rule
of
law
announced--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
but
what
happened
in
finn
is
that
the
court
also
said,
of
course,
on
remand
this
problem
can
be
cured
by
dismissing
the
non-diverse
defendant,
and
that
is
of
course
precisely
what
happened
on
remand
in
finn.
the
plaintiff
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
non-diverse
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals
granted
the
motion,
reinstated
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff,
even
though
there
was
no
diversity
at
the
time
that
case
had
originally
gotten
into
federal
court,
and
reinstated
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff,
and
then
this
court
denied
certiorari.
so,
what
actually
happened
in
finn
was
that
the
rule
that
we're
relying
on
here
which
was
announced
by
the
court
in
finn
was
applied,
and
the
verdict...
the
judgment
of
the
federal
court
was
not
thrown
out.
in
fact,
the
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
was
sustained.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
rule
announced
in
finn
doesn't
draw
the
distinction
between
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant,
and
notions
of
consent
or
waiver
or
things
like
that
seem
to
have
no
relevance,
it
seems
to
us,
when
the
defect
is
a
jurisdictional
defect.
the
court
either
has
jurisdiction
or
it
doesn't.
now,
in
this
respect
a
very
significant
case
i
think
is
this
court's
decision
in
newman-green,
which
is
less
than
a
decade
old,
a
decision
that
the
plaintiff
relegates
to
a
footnote
and
says
there's
no
relevance.
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
precisely
on
point
in
view
of
the
thought
that
your
honor
is
expressing.
newman-green
is
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
filed
suit
in
federal
court
alleging
diversity
of
citizenship.
there
was
in
fact
no
diversity
of
citizenship.
that
case
shouldn't
have
been
in
federal
court.
nonetheless,
the
plaintiff
recovered
a
large
judgment.
when
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
jurisdictional
error
was
discovered,
and
what
happened,
though,
is
not
that
the
case
was
thrown
out
of
federal
court,
but
that
the
error
was
remedied
on
appeal.
and
this
court
sanctioned
that,
saying
the
non-diverse
defendant
could
simply
be
dismissed
from
the
case
on
appeal,
and
in
fact
that's
what
happened.
the
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
was
instated.
that
was
a
case
where
the
defendant
didn't
ask
to
be
in
federal
court.
he
was
erroneously
dragged
into
federal
court,
and
yet
a
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
was
sustained
by
dismissing
the
non-diverse
defendant.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
complete
response
to
the
suggestion
that
the
jurisdictional
rule
should
depend
upon
whether
it's
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
that
may
have
made
the
error
or
who--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
this
court
relied
on
rule
21
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
this
court
didn't
cite
any
provision.
it
relied
on
rule
21.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it's
true
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
initial
choice
of
forum
but
that
doesn't
trump
every
other
rule.
it's
also
true
under
the
statutes
that
the
defendant,
when
he
sued
in
a
state
other
than
his
own...
and
there's
diversity
of
citizenship...
has
the
right
to
remove
that
case
to
federal
court.
now,
as
this
case
was
actually
tried,
there
was
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
defendant
was
an
out-of-state
defendant,
and
therefore
it
was
appropriate
for
this
case
to
be
tried
in
federal
court.
so,
in
any
event,
our
position
is
this
case
is
in
fact
precisely
like
finn,
a
case
that's
been...
was
decided
50
years
ago,
has
been
applied
in
dozens
and
dozens
of
court
of
appeals
cases
since,
and
as
stated
without
qualification
in
the
leading
treatises,
that
even
though
there
may
not
have
been
jurisdiction
when
the
case
was
removed
to
federal
court,
if
jurisdiction
attaches
subsequently
prior
to
trial,
then
the
judgment
should
not
be
reversed
on
appeal,
even
if
in
fact
federal
jurisdiction
was
not
present
at
the
time
of
trial...
at
the
time
of
removal.
now,
there's
no
question
that
that
black
letter
rule
was
fully
satisfied
in
this
case.
at
the
time
of
the
6-day
jury
trial
and
at
the
time
judgment
was
entered
for
caterpillar,
the
case
was
plainly
within
the
federal
court's
diversity
jurisdiction--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
finn
talks
about
both.
you
know,
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
in
the
situation
where
there
was
no
diversity
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
trial,
but
there
was
between...
you
know,
jurisdiction
attached
between
trial
and
judgment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
would
seem
that
if
it
could
be--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
that's
right,
justice
souter.
in
finn
itself,
it
was
cured
on
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
i
think
that's
right.
but
the
rule
announced
in
finn
is
that
there
has
to
be
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
trial
and
there
was
in
this
case,
which
is
our
only
point.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
court
has
not
engaged
in
any
harmful
error
analysis
in
any
of
these
cases.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
that's
right
because
this
is
a
case--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
don't
think
in
this
situation
the
court
has
ever
done
that.
in
finn
it
didn't
ask
would
the
case
have
come
out
differently
in
state
court.
in
newman-green,
which
is
perhaps
a
better
example,
where
the
court
didn't
ask
should
this...
would
the
defendant
have
been...
was
the
defendant
prejudiced
by
being
in
district...
federal
district
court
because
that
was
a
case
that
should
have
been
brought
in
state
court.
it
didn't
ask
those
questions.
it
was
simply
enough
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy
and
administration.
it
was
a
perfectly
fair
federal
judgment
entered
at
a
time
when
there
was
jurisdiction,
and
the
court
said
we're
simply
not
going
to
reverse
that
sort
of
a
judgment,
you
know,
because
of
an
error
that
was
cured
or
error
that
could
be
cured
at
this
stage.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
court
in
newman-green
rejected
reliance
on
section
1653
is
recollection.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
said
rule
21.
that's
right
because
the
court
unanimously--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--allegations.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right,
exactly.
that's
what
the
court
held
in
newman-green.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
debate,
as
i
recollect,
in
newman-green
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
was--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
was
the
position
of
the
dissent
in
newman-green.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
was
an
excellent
dissent,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
but
i
believe
seven
justices
disagreed
with
it.
now,
our
position
is
that
this
court
needn't
go
any
further
than
that
in
resolving
this
case.
the
sixth
circuit
was
plainly
wrong
we
believe
in
reversing
the
judgment
below
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
it's
undisputed
that
diversity
jurisdiction
existed
at
the
time
of
trial
and
at
the
time
of
judgment
and
existed
on
appeal,
exists
today
in
this
case.
this
court
should
apply
its
settled
precedents
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
and
to
send
the
case
back
for
consideration
of
the
rest
of
plaintiff's
arguments
on
appeal.
i
just
want
to
make
one
last
point
and
then
hopefully
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
just
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
comments.
the
plaintiff
has
made
no
effort
in
this
court
to
defend
the
sixth
circuit's
decision,
no
effort
at
all
to
defend
the
sixth
circuit's
jurisdictional
rationale
presumably
discovering
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
finn
and
grubbs
and
newman-green
and
that
line
of
cases
in
this
court.
instead,
his
brief
conjures
up
a
completely
different
statutory
argument.
i've
tried
to
suggest
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions
these
arguments
were
never
made
below.
no
lower
court
has
ever
found
any
violation
of
the
removal
statute
in
this
case.
so,
we
think
even
if
there
were
merit
to
these
statutory
arguments,
which
there
isn't,
it's
really
far
too
late
in
the
day
for
the
respondent
to
be
bringing
up
new
statutory
arguments
and
asking
the
court
to
affirm
on
those
grounds.
this
case
is,
we
think,
precisely
governed
by
the
finn
line
of
cases.
and
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
two
short
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
caterpillar
didn't
make
this
argument
until
its
rehearing
petition
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
simply
not
true.
apparently
during
the
oral
argument
in
the
sixth
circuit,
some
question
arose
as
to
what
would
happen
if
the
jurisdictional
error
was
cured,
and
caterpillar
on
september
28th,
1995,
after
the
oral
argument
but
before
the
sixth
circuit
decided
this
case,
sent
up
a
post-argument
letter
which
cited
grubbs,
cited
lower
court
cases
like
able
v.
upjohn
which
cited
finn.
so,
all
of
these
cases
were
before
the
sixth
circuit,
in
addition
to
this
argument
being
before
the
sixth
circuit,
prior
to
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
second,
let
me
just
say
one
last
thing
about
this
1-year
provision
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
violated
here
and
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
argument
has
never
been
preserved.
the
purpose
of
the
1-year
provision...
congress
put
the
1-year
limit
in
the
statute
a
few
years
ago
in
order
to
prevent
the
delays
and
disruptions
that
occur
when
a
case
is
rested
out
of
one
court
system
and
put
in
another
court
system
after
a
lot
of
work
has
been
done
on
a
case
in
the
first
court
system.
that's
why
the
1-year
provision
is
in
there,
to
prevent
diversity
removals
after
a
case
has
progressed
quite
a
while
in
state
court.
yet,
that's
the
precisely
the
evil
that
would
occur
here
if
the
plaintiff's
argument
prevailed
because
it
would
mean
that
a
case
that
has
been
essentially
completed
in
federal
court
would
have
to
start
all
over
again
from
scratch
in
state
court
and
be
retried
there.
so,
the
plaintiff's
argument...
not
only
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
1-year
provision,
since
the
removal
occurred
here
prior
to
a
year,
it's
plainly
inconsistent
with
congress'
policy
in
putting
the
1-year
provision
in
the
statute
to
acquire
a
case
that's
gone
to
verdict
in
federal
court
to
be
tried
again
from
scratch
in
state
court,
even
though
there
was
no
error
in
the
federal
proceedings.
so,
we
would
ask
that
the
decision
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
that
the
plaintiff
be
allowed
to
raise
whatever
other
arguments
he
had
on
appeal
in
the
sixth
circuit.
thank
you.
