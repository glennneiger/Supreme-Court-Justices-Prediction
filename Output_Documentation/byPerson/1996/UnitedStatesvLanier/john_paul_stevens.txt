justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
on
that
question?
suppose
the
judge
is
presiding
at
a
trial,
and
the...
this
potential
victim
is
a
party
to
the
case,
and
he
says,
i
want
to
have
a
pretrial
conference,
i
just
want
to
see
you
in
chambers,
and
say
i'm
planning
to
rule
against
you
unless
you
submit
to
my
advances,
would
that
be
covered
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
his...
he
says,
i
threaten
you
with
an
exercise
of
my
power
to
rule
against
you
in
the
case
pending
before
me
unless
you
do
what
i
want
you
to
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
say
that
isn't
colorable.
