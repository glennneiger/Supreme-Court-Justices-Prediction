justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that's
true,
then
why
does...
there
has
to
be
a
serious
touching,
or
a
serious
assault,
because
that
was
part
of
your
submission
at
the
outset.
if
indeed
it
is
the
fourth
amendment
that
is
controlling,
why
is
not
any
offensive
touching
a
violation
of
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
view
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
really
the
controlling
element
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
that
was
what
misled
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
perhaps
misheard
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
let's
get
to
the
next
part,
then,
which
is
how--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how
serious
it
has
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
in
relation
very
specifically
to
his
duties.
supposing
in
your
case
in
this
courthouse
a
janitor
leaped
out
of
a
closet,
abducted
a
woman,
and
molested
her.
would
that
be
a
242
violation,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he's
on
the
premises.
it's
during
the
course
of
his
employment.
it's
obviously...
he's
not
using
the
employment
in
any
other
way
than
as
a
physical
proximity,
to
get
access
to
the
victim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
incidentally
i'm
not
sure
that
that
isn't
true
in
the
case
that's
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
haec
verba.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
are
you
saying
that
this
makes
the
right
more
specific?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
you
are,
then
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
souter
might
have
been
that
color
of
law
is
necessary
for
us
to
consider
to
make
the
right
more
specific.
now,
maybe
that's
not
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would...
would
you
distinguish
the
hypothetical
justice
scalia
just
gave
you
and
the
case
we
have
before
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
but
i
thought
you
could
answer
justice
stevens
that
that
is
a
more
specific
right
than
the
right
that's
involved
in
this
case,
i.e.,
the
right
to
be
free
from
having
the
judicial
officer
use
the
powers
and
the
authority
of
his
office
in
order
to
commit
a
sexual
assault.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
has
not
been
the
government's
submission
here
this
morning,
and
it
was
not
the
theory
on
which
it
tried
the
case,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
take
color
of
law
out
of
it.
let's
take
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
the
judge
orders
the
person
into
their...
into
his
chambers
by
herself
and
commits
an
aggravated
sexual
assault.
is
there
a
specific
right
of
bodily
integrity
that
the
judge
has
violated
in
the
exercise
of
his
office
by
an
abuse
of
his
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
we
have
all
the
color
of
law
that
we
can
hypothesize.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
there
is
a
specific
right...
there's
a
specific
right
of
bodily
integrity
outside
the
context
of
people
in
custody.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
something
fictional
about
screws...
i've
always
had
a
problem
with
it...
when
we
say
that
the
defendant
there
was
wilfully
depriving
the
person
of
his
sixth
amendment
right,
of
his
fifth
amendment
right?
that
really
wasn't
in
the
mind
of
these
sheriffs
at
all
was
it,
in
screws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
they
didn't
beat
him
once
because
of
his
fifth
amendment
right,
another
because
of
his
sixth
amendment--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
asking,
isn't
that
something
of
a
fiction,
even
in
screws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
fiction
is
is
that
they
probably
weren't
thinking
in
constitutional
terms,
and
if
you
use
the
term
wilfully,
then
you
say
well,
you
intend
the
consequences
of
your
act,
but
then
you're
right
back
where
you
started
from.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
seems
to
take
out
the
one
specific
element
that
you
put
in
at
the
beginning
of
the
premise.
