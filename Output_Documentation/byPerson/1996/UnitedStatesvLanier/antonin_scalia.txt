or
laws.
now,
the
constitution,
or
the
laws
here...
you're
talking
about
federal
law
that
was
the
basis
for
this
charge,
anyway.
the
constitution
does
not
protect
you
against
derivation
of
your
physical
integrity.
if
a
private
individual
comes
up
and
beats
you
up,
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--exactly,
and...
well,
more
than
under
color
of
law.
there
has
to
be
some
state
participation
in
some
manner
or
other.
now,
i
had
thought
that
when
we
were
dealing
with
the
due
process
clause's
procedural
component,
procedural
due
process,
any
action
of
the
state
would
suffice
to
come
within
this
provision
of
being
the
right
guaranteed
by
the
constitution,
so
that
even
if
the
state
is
acting
as
employer
and
terminates
your
contract
without
proper
procedure
it
would
be
a
deprivation
of
procedural
due
process,
but
i
had
not
thought
that
when
we're
talking
about
substantive
due
process
every
activity
of
the
state
brings
down
upon
those
state
actors
the
prohibitions
of
the
federal
constitution.
for
example,
if
someone
goes
into
a
motor
vehicle
registration
office
and
the
person
behind
the
desk
jumps
up
and
punches
the
person,
i
would
not
consider
that
to
be
any
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
it's
a
state
actor
in
the
function
of
his
job.
but
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
in
order
to
come
within
substantive
due
process
protection
the
state
must
be
acting
in
its...
what
should
i
say,
in
its
compulsory
fashion.
it
must
be
exerting
state
power,
not
just
acting
like
an
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
policeman,
for
example,
arresting
someone
is
exerting
state
power
over
you,
and
if
in
the
course
of
that
he
beats
you
up,
substantive
due
process
has
been
violated.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
referring
to
the
phrase,
under
color.
i
was
referring
to
rights
secured
or
protected
by
the
constitution.
i
was
not
referring
to
the
phrase,
under
color.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
think
we've
treated
substantive
and
procedural
due
process
differently.
unless
you
disagree
about
my--
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
my
example...
my
example
of
the
motor
vehicle
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
jumps
up
and
beats--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
any
physical
tort
committed
by
a
state
agent
in
the
course
of
his
employment
is
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i
just
don't
agree.
i
cannot
imagine
that
242
was
meant
to
cover
that
situation
in
which
a,
you
know,
a
state
bureaucrat
jumps
up
from
the
desk
and
punches
somebody
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's
not
true.
it
was
raised
in
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
first
opportunity
that
this
defendant
could
raise
it.
it
wasn't
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
moreover,
your
opponent
contends,
and
i
tend
to
agree,
that
color
of
state
law
is
one
issue,
but
that
the
same
kind
of
considerations
arise
in
the
interpretation
of
the
phrase,
rights
secured
or
protected
by
the
constitution,
that
it
is
not
all
rights
to
physical
integrity
that
are
protected
by
the
constitution,
but
only
those
that
are
taken
away
by
the
state
in
a
certain
fashion,
and
his
contention
is
that
that
fashion
has
to
be
when
the
state
is
exerting
governmental
power,
is
acting
as
custodian,
or
in
some
other
fashion,
so
the
same
issue
comes
up
in
a
different
guise,
not
under
color
of
law
but
under
the
other
provisions--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
disposed
of
the
case
against
you
and
found
it
unnecessary...
having
found
against
you
on
another
ground,
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
color
of
law
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
seems
dirty
pool,
to
never
give
the
defendant
a
shot
at
that
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
of
appeals
never
considered
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
you
wouldn't.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
our
rule
3.2.
[laughter]
the
dirty
pool
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
a
policeman
trying
to
keep
order
at
a
parade
or
in
a
demonstration
who
just...
and
has
authority
to...
he
doesn't
have
custody
of
the
onlookers,
but
he
has
authority
to
keep
them
back
from
the
street,
and
he
wades
in
with
a
baton
and
starts
beating
them?
wouldn't
that
qualify?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
custody.
i
think
the
issue
is
the
exertion
of
state
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
jury
might
find
it,
as
you
acknowledge.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
acknowledge,
although
they
weren't
asked
to
find
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
weren't
asked
to,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
any
authority
the
state
gives
him,
even
the
authority
simply
to
hire
or
fire
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
not
a
distinctively
governmental--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
question
was
broader,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
depend
on
what
it
is
that
we're
inquiring
is
reasonably
definite
or
not?
i
mean,
if
the
issue
is
whether
it's
reasonably
definite
that
depriving
someone
of
his
physical
integrity
can
in
some
circumstances
constitute
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
you
can
find
that
to
be
reasonably
definite
relatively
easily.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you're
going
to
fold
into
the
inquiry
whether
it's
reasonably
definite
that
a
judge
who
is
not
immediately
in
the
exercise
of
his
judicial
authorities
conducts
an
assault
of
this
sort
in
his
chambers,
if
that's
the
question
on
the
other
hand,
you
come
up
with
a
different
answer,
and
how
do
we
decide
at
what
level
of
generality
to
ask
the
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
took
that
to
mean
that
they
had
to
intend
to
make
sure
this
guy
never
got
to
trial,
whether
or
not
they
knew
there
was
a
constitutional
right
for
him
to
get
to
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
had
to
intend
to
prevent
him
from
getting
to
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
how
it
reads?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
right
to
travel,
or
of
the
right
to
be
tried,
but
certainly
not
just
to
beat
up
the
citizen.
