justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
color
of
law,
i
thought
that
there
was
a
question
of...
the
definition
of
classic,
as
i
understand
it,
was
a
misuse
of
power
possessed
by
virtue
of
state
law
and
made
possible
only
because
the
wrongdoer
is
clothed
with
the
authority
of
the
law.
i
take
it
you
accept
that
as
a
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
mean,
my
question
really
is
that
you
accept
that
as
a
proper--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right,
and
you
accept
that
as
proper,
so
then
the
only
question
would
be...
if
you
do
accept
that
as
a
proper
definition,
the
only
question
would
be
whether
the
facts
bring
it
within
that
definition,
which
the
jury
found
they
did.
is...
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
then
you
accept
the
definition
of
the
solicitor
general.
i
mean,
the
basic
issue,
i
guess,
is
whether
there
is
a
specific
defined...
whether
there
is
a
federal
right
made
definite,
and
is
it
sufficient
in
your
opinion
that
the
federal
right
involved
is
a
right
given
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
in
defining
those
matters
that
the
state
cannot
take
from
a
person
irrespective
of
what
procedure
it
gives?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
called...
what
i
want
to
do
is
give
you
two
or
three
suggestions
and
see
how
you
respond.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you'd
say,
one,
this
is
in
the
area
of
substantive
due
process,
i.e.,
the
state
cannot
remove
it
from
a
person
irrespective
of
the
procedures.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
second...
second...
and
that's,
say,
a
right
against
serious
bodily
intrusion,
serious
and
substantial
bodily
intrusions.
second,
the
state
criminal
law
makes
it
a
crime,
and
third,
the
person
knows
it,
so
there
is
no
surprise,
no
possibility
that
what
he
thinks
he
was
doing
was
right,
and
fourth,
there
are
cases
saying
in
related
virtually
indistinguishable
areas
that
the
federal
constitution
protects
it.
where
you
have
those
four
things,
is
there
any
reason
why
it
would
not
be
sufficiently
specific
under
screws
to
permit
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
a
policeman
can't
beat
up
a
person,
say
in
the
parade,
can't
hit
him
over
the
head,
can't
put
his
fist
in
the
person's
face
at
the
parade,
i
suppose
it's
somewhat
similar
to
have
offensive
sexual
contact
with
a
woman
at
the
least.
is
there
some
difference
between
those
two
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--isn't
that
part
of
screws
dealing
with
the
under
color
of
law
question?
yes.
which
is
just
what
justice
souter
said?
of
course--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--wasn't
the
part
of
screws
you're
talking
about
dealing
with
the
question
under
color
of
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
a
murder
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
if
one
private
citizen
has
murdered
another,
and
i
thought
that's
what
they
had
in
mind
by
that
instruction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
right,
you
could...
i
could
know
it
was
a
right,
because
i
know
that
the
criminal
law
makes
criminal
that
which
i
am
doing,
thereby
giving
a
right
to
the
victim.
