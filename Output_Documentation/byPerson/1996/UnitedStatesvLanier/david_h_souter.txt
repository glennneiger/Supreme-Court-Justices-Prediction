justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
waxman,
assuming...
taking
that
as
you
say,
help
me
on
one
thing.
i
thought
we
could
decide
this
case,
and
i
thought
the
issue
that
you
had
brought
to
us
could
be
decided
without
getting
into
the
question
of
the
scope
of
under
color
of
state
law,
and
i
think
you
just
said
or
implied
that
the
concept
of
color
of
law
was
never
an
issue
in
the
trial
court.
am
i
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
was
it
resolved
against
the
government,
or--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
change
my
question.
the
only
issue
that
you
have
brought
to
us,
as
i
understand,
is
the
issue
of
how
definite
the
right
must
have
been
articulated
prior
to
the
charge
that
is
brought
under
this
statute,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
that
issue
be
decided,
as
i
assumed
it
could
be,
without
getting
into
the
concept
of
color
of
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
you
win
on
that
you
then
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings
on
color
of
law,
or
the...
justice
scalia's
articulation
of
the
concept
of
right
guaranteed?
justice
david
h.
souter
similarly
but
not
identically?
why
shouldn't
that
be
identical?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
don't
you
think
the
standard
should
be
the
same
for...
under
each
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
that
goes
to
the
color
of
law
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
before
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
understand
your
point
there,
but
i
think
my
question
is
this:
if
we
should
determine
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
applying
a
standard
which
goes
beyond
what
mr.
waxman
suggested,
in
other
words
that
goes
beyond
reasonably
definite,
and
instead
require
the
substantially
identical
circumstances
or
facts
i
think
is
how
the
court
of
appeals
articulated
it,
if
we
say
that
was
an
error,
isn't
it
possible
to
dispose
of
that
issue
without
ever
determining
whether
in
this
particular,
or
in
any
of
these
particular
instances
the
office
or
the
judge
in
this
case
was
acting
under
color
of
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
suppose
we
would
just
say
we
are
determining
only
the
question
here,
how
definitely
the
right
must
have
been
articulated
prior
to
the
commencement
of
this
prosecution,
or
prior
to
the
act
charged--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
questions
of
state
action
and
color
of
law
are
simply--
justice
david
h.
souter
--not
covered
by
our
opinion.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
inclined
to
agree
with
you
on
the
point
of
breadth
that
you
raise,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
agree
with
you
that
we
could
not
decide
the
case
on
the
grounds
of
what
i
will
call
prior
definite
statement
of
the
right
without
getting
into
color--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wouldn't
it
be
sufficient
if
the
jury
found
that
what
he
said
was
the
equivalent
of
this:
if
a
custody
case,
if
your
custody
case
comes
before
me,
i
can
decide
it
against
you
unless
you
do
what
i
want
you
to
do
right
now?
if
a
jury
could
find
that,
that
would
be
enough,
even
for
your
view
of
color
of
law,
would
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer
and
to
the
chief
justice,
as
i
understand
it
you're
drawing
a
distinction
something
like
this.
you're
saying
that
the
official
was
acting
under
color
of
law
if,
in
effect,
he
abuses
the
authority
which
the
state
law
ostensibly
gives
him
as
distinguished
from
simply
using
influence
which
incidentally
comes
to
him
because
he's
a
state
official.
is
that
the
way
you
draw
the
line,
roughly?
justice
david
h.
souter
weren't
they
concerned
with
the
problem
of
evolution
taking
place
in
the
course
of
the
prosecution
itself,
and
if
that
was
their
concern,
then
doesn't
the
government
answer
that
concern
when
the
government
says,
we'll
settle
for
a
standard
like
the
creighton
standard
on
qualified
immunity?
is
it
reasonably
definite,
and
if
it
is
reasonably
definite
by
reference
to
the
law
prior
to
this
prosecution,
doesn't
that
satisfy
the
concern
that
underlay
the
statements
that
were
made
in
screws?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
boils
down
to
saying,
it
seems
to
me,
we
don't
think
the
ordinary
citizen
or,
indeed,
in
this
case
the
ordinary
official,
should
be
in
the
position
of
having
a
surprise
pulled
on
him
when
to
that
official,
even
without
having
done
massive
research,
it
would
not
have
seemed
reasonably
definite
in
advance
that
what
he
was
doing
was
in
fact
a
substantive
violation.
isn't
that
what
they
were
getting
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
the
ex
post
facto
problem?
if
it's
reasonably
definite
before
the
act,
then
the
ex
post
facto
problem,
it
seems
to
me,
goes
away
because
you've
got
what
is
admittedly
a
formula
criminal
statute,
but
you've
got
a
source
of
content
for
it
which
predates
the
act,
and
doesn't
that
respond
to
the
ex
post
facto
concern?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
reasonably
definite
enough,
reasonably
definite
within
the
sense
that
is
used
in
creighton?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
maybe
the
screws
court
had
nothing
more
in
mind
than
the
possibility
of
the
situation
of
the
prisoner
being
led
down
the
hallway
to
trial
and
a
judge
in
a
fit
of
exasperation
coming
out
of
his
chambers
with
a
revolver
and
shooting
him.
in
that
case,
i
suppose
the
judge
was
not
on
either
your
test
or
mr.
waxman's
test
exercising
that
authority
that
would
bring
him
under
color
of
law.
i
thought
that
was
the
example,
though.
wasn't
that
sort
of
the
same
example?
i
thought
that
was
the
example
that
justice
ginsburg
gave,
the
same
kind
of
thing,
a
judge
who
didn't
shoot
him
but
just
jumped
out
of
his
chamber
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
depending
on
just
how
far
we
go
with
specificity,
may
i
at
least
come
back
to
consider
a
distinction
raised
by
justice
ginsburg's
question?
your
answer
was
very
probably
under
screws
that
that,
in
fact,
would
not
qualify
as
a
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
i
understood
it
under
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
the
person
who
was
subject
to
the
sexual
assault
would
have
been
subject
to
the
judge's
judicial
jurisdiction
later
on.
doesn't
that
affect
the
answer,
and
for
that
reason
shouldn't
the
answer...
shouldn't
your
answer
have
been
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
to
threaten
her.
