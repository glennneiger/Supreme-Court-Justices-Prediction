mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
between
1989
and
1991,
the
jury
found
judge
david
lanier
sexually
assaulted
five
women
in
his
judicial
chambers,
one
by
repeated
forcible
oral
rape,
the
others
by
what
the
jury
concluded
was
"physical
abuse
of
a
serious,
substantial
nature.
"
as
to
each
count
on
which
lanier
was
convicted,
the
jury
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
first
that
lanier's
conduct
had
deprived
the
victims
of
a
right
secured
or
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
that
is,
the
right
to
be
free
of
unjustified
physical
abuse,
including
sexual
assault,
of
a
serious,
substantial
nature
under
color
of
law
and,
second,
that
he
had
acted
wilfully,
which
the
court
defined
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
screws
v.
united
states.
a
divided
en
banc
sixth
circuit
ordered
the
indictments
dismissed
because
in
the
majority's
view
the
due
process
right
to
be
free
of
forcible
and
coerced
sexual
assault
had
not
been
made
specifically...
sufficiently
specific
for
the
defendant
to
have
known
that
in
assaulting
his
victims
he
was
violating
their
constitutional
rights.
in
concluding
that
sexual
assault
or
any
serious
unjustified
assault
committed
under
color
of
law
cannot
be
prosecuted
under
section
242,
the
court
below
misapprehended
screws
and
applied
a
standard
no
court
has
ever
found
necessary
or
appropriate.
because
the
jury
found
that
lanier
had
sexually
assaulted
his
victims
while
acting
under
color
of
law
and
with
the
knowledge
and
intention
of
violating
their
legal
rights,
and
because
decisions
of
the
federal
courts
had
made
specific
the
due
process
protection
of
those
rights,
the
defendant
was
properly
and
constitutionally
convicted
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
yes,
we
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
would
stand
corrected.
i
had
thought
that
what
the
two
dissenting
justices
said
was
that
the
misdemeanors
didn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
specifically
defined
constitutional
violation.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
in
any
event,
we
do
disagree.
we
certainly
recognize
that
there
is
a
very
significant
difference
in
degree
as
to
the
conduct
with
respect
to
the
coerced
oral
rapes
and
the
conduct
with
respect
to
the
other
five
misdemeanor
convictions,
but
the
right
that
has
been
made
specific
in
this
case
is
the
right
that
this
court
in
ingraham
v.
wright
identified.
it
made
specific
the
substantive
due
process
"right
to
be
free
from
unjustified
intrusions
on
personal
security.
"
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
your...
justice
kennedy,
your
question
raises
a
lot
of
issues.
one
is
whether
it's
the
fourth
amendment
that's
controlling,
and
the
second,
why
it
is
that
substantial
serious
was
included
in
the
jury
instruction.
if
i
can...
i
will
attempt
to
answer
each
of
them
separately.
we
don't
think...
we
did
not
understand
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
controlling
in
this
case.
this
was
alleged,
the
indictment
alleged
that
this
was
a
substantive
due
process
violation,
the
substantive
due
process
right
being
the
right
to
freedom
from
unwarranted
intrusions
by
under
color
of
state
law
physical
integrity.
we
don't
understand
the
fourth
amendment
cases...
and
that
was
our
effort
to
articulate
a
right
that
had
been
made
specific
by
this
court
in
a
series
of
due
process
decisions.
we
did...
have
not
understood
this
court's
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence,
particularly
in
light
of
james
daniel
goode
real
estate,
to
include
searches
or
conduct
that
occurs
either
outside
the
law
enforcement
context
or,
in
any
event,
as
not
part
of
a
search
for
or
an
effort
to
protect
evidence
of
wrongdoing.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
think
that
it's
not,
although
if
it
were,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
find
that
in
any
event
there
is
no
prejudice
to
the
defendant
because
in
any
event
the
constitutional
right
alleged
to
have
been
violated
would
have
been
the
fourteenth
amendment,
since
the
fourth
amendment
would
apply
only
as
incorporated,
and
the
sub--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
i...
if
i
did,
i
certainly
meant
to
say
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
left
off
a
digit.
[laughter]
in
any
event,
we
don't
think,
even
if
it
were
the
fourth
amendment...
i
think
this
is
responsive
to
both
of
your
questions...
even
the
test
would
be
the
same,
because
the
question
under
substantive
due
process
under
ingraham
and
its
progeny,
whether...
would
be
whether
the
physical
intrusion
was
"unjustified"--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
then
the
fourth
amendment
test
would
be
unreasonable.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
in
ingraham
this
court
recognized
in
the
due
process
context,
as
this
court
recognized
in
mcmillian
and
the
eighth
amendment
context
and
other
courts
have
recognized,
that
"there
is,
of
course,
a
de
minimis
level
of
imposition
with
which
the
constitution
is
not
concerned.
"
now,
the
problem
in
every
case,
of
course,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
de
minimis
threshold
was
surmounted.
in
the
case
of
the
forced
oral
rape
of
vivian
archie,
i...
we
submit
there
is
no
possible...
there's
no
conceivable
notion
that
it
wasn't
surmounted,
but
if
we
look
to
this
court's
precedent,
in
ingraham
itself,
after
stating
that
there
was
a
de
minimis
level
of
imposition,
it
held
that
because
in
ingraham
itself
appreciable
physical
pain
was
inflicted
the
threshold
was
certainly
met.
now,
that
threshold,
the
threshold
of
de
minimis,
is
one
which
decisions
of
this
court
have
not
made
more
specific,
but
lower--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
certainly
did.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
that
is
why
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
because
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
we
thought
that
the
shocks-the-conscience
standard
was
unnecessary.
we
didn't
submit
it.
the
defendant
asked
for
it.
it
was
clearly
cumulative
of
the
other
requirements,
the
serious
and
substantial
nature
that
the
jury
had--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
very--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
agree
that
it
is
a
very
important
question,
and
if
i
could,
justice
o'connor,
let
me
address
this
case
and
then
get
to
where...
how
we
think
these
cases
should
be
decided
under
other
circumstances.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
we
think
that
at
a
minimum
the
standard
is
a
serious
and
substantial
intrusion,
and
we
think
that
because
the
jury
was
so
instructed
in
this
case,
that
as
to
those
counts
that
the
jury
convicted...
and
the
jury
was
quite
discriminating
in
this
case.
it
acquitted
on
three
counts,
and
one
count
was
dismissed
by
the
judge
on
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
as
to
those
counts
on
which
the
jury
convicted,
there
is
more
than
enough,
way
more
than
enough
evidence
for
a
rational
fact-finder
to
conclude--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
true
that
all
but
the
oral
rapes
were
misdemeanor
convictions,
but
none...
it
may
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
instructions
in
this
case
set
the
bar
too
high.
ordinarily
in...
i
would
think
in
one
of
these
cases
a
trial
judge,
if
presented
with
a
clearly
insignificant
or
relatively
insignificant
intrusion,
would
apply
the
same
jackson
v.
virginia
standard
that
it
would
apply,
for
example,
in
a
1983
suit
or
a
242
prosecution
brought
alleging
that
a...
that
in
the
course
of
an
arrest
or
a
seizure
unreasonable
force
was
used.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
there
is
in
this
as
in,
for
example,
when
a
jury
is
asked
to
decide
whether
a
search
and
seizure
is
unreasonable--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--or
whether
an
obscenity
case--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
the
state
of
mind
requirement.
under
242,
under
screws,
this
court
has
said
that
242
may
constitutionally
be
applied
only
if
the
defendant
acted
wilfully.
that
is...
and
i'm
quoting
screws...
when
persons
act
wilfully
in
the
sense
in
which
we
use
the
word,
they
act
in
open
defiance
or
in
reckless
disregard
of
a
constitutional
requirement
which
has
been
made
specific
and
definite,
and
in
deciding
monroe
v.
pape,
for
example,
this
court
emphasized
a
much
higher
intent
requirement
that
is
required.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
intentional
in
conventional
common...
in
conventional
criminal
law
terms,
and
it's
reflected
in
all
of
the
pattern
jury
instructions,
an
intent
to
do
a
crime,
a
specific
intent
to
do
a
crime
means
that
you
intend
to
do
the
act
which
you
do.
but
as
this
court
said
in
screws,
the
common
definition
of
wilfulness
implies
something
much
more.
that
is,
a
bad
purpose,
or
a
specific
intent
to
do
something
that
the
law
forbids,
knowing
that
the
law
forbids
it,
and
intending
that
it
be
forbade,
and
that
in
fact
is
precisely
what
we
have
in
this
case.
in
this
case
we
really
have
quite
an
extraordinary
set
of
circumstances.
in
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
the...
judge
lanier's
counsel
said,
and
i
am
quoting
at
page
110
of
the
joint
appendix,
i
am
satisfied
that
a
deprivation
of
freedom
and
liberty
from
sexual
assault
is
adequate.
and
when
judge
lanier
testified,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
volume
9
at
page
1569,
he
was
asked,
question:
well,
you
understand,
for
example,
judge,
that
everybody
in
this
country
has
a
right
to
be
free
from
sexual
assault
and
abuse.
you
understand
that,
don't
you?
yes,
sir,
i
understand
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
laws.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you
have
to
have
under
color
of
law.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
i
understand
your
point
about
state
action.
let
me
say
first
that
although
i
understand
your
view
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
terms,
under
color,
dozens
and
dozens
of
lower
court
decisions
have
not
construed
it
that
way,
including
many
of
the
assault
cases
and
other
cases
that
this
court
has
specifically
cited
approvingly.
but
let
me
just--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
right...
this
court
has
said,
justice
holmes
in
the
moseley
case
and
this
court
many
times
since
has
said
that
this
statute
and
its
companion,
241,
protect
all
federal
rights
in
a
bundle.
that
is,
all
rights
created
by
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
do
disagree.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
disagree--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
disagree,
and
i
could
cite--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
a...
an
assault
committed
by
a
state
agent
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
or
something
that
satisfies
the
classic
definition
of
under
color
of
state
law,
if
it
violates
state
law--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
let
me
give
you
an
example
from
polk
v.
dodson,
a
case
that
this
court
decided,
in
which
case
this
court
held
that
a
state
public
defender
was
not
acting
under
color
of
law
when
she
was
engaging
in
the
representation
of
her
clients
because,
as
this
court
subsequently
explained
in
west
v.
adkins,
she
was
acting
as
the
adversary
of
the
state.
in
polk
v.
dodson
this
court
said
we
leave
undisturbed
cases
like,
for
example,
the
section
242
prosecution
in
the
seventh
circuit
case
of
united
states
v.
senacht,
where
a
state
public
defender
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
under
242
for
extorting
money
from
friends
and
relatives
of
people
that
he
was
representing.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
probably
not.
it
would
be
very
difficult,
i
think,
to...
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
show
that
the
janitor
was
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
this...
i'm
not...
i
don't
know
of
any--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
let
me
talk
about
the
case
that's
before
us.
the...
none
of
the
six
opinions
issued
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
concluded
that
the
defendant
did
not
act
under
color
of
state
law,
and
with
good
reason.
state
law
is
a...
state
action,
or
color
of
state
law
is
a
jury
question,
and
the
jury
in
this
case
was
instructed
in
hac
verba
from
this
court's
classic
definition--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
united
states
v.
classic,
and
the
evidence,
i
submit,
certainly
exceeds
the
minimum
that
is
necessary
to
find--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
certainly
not,
but
what
you
have
in
this
case
were,
all
of
these
assaults
occurred...
and
i
don't
intend
to
get
into
the
details
of
these
assaults,
but
all
of
these
assaults
occurred
in
his
chambers
during
regular
working
hours
as
to
women
who
were
either
employees
hired
and
supervised
by
him
or
people
who
were
there
in
connection
with
an
official
responsibility
in
which
he
had
asked
them
to
be
there,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
believe
it
was
an
issue
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
was
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is,
the...
there
was
a
pretrial
motion
to...
well,
i
will--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
correct,
and
that
was
the
only
basis
for
the
en
banc
majority.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
we
certainly
think
it
can
be.
of
course,
a
judgment
below
can
be
affirmed,
i
suppose,
on
any
grounds,
but
the
issue
of
under
color
of
state
law
was
only
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
red
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
would
make
two
points,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
there
are
a
raft
of
lower
court
decisions
applying
242
and
1...
and
1983
in
contexts
in
which
the
state
is
not
acting
as
custodian
of
some
sort.
and
second
of
all,
i
would
make
the
point
that
we
tried
to
make
in
our
brief
that
the
notion
that
somehow
individuals
who
are
in
custody,
either
in
a
mental
institution
or
prison
or
in
a
public
school,
somehow
have
more
rights
to
be
free
of
unjustified
bodily
intrusion
than
free
citizens
is
exactly
the
opposite
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--as
to
vivian
archie
i
think
the
facts
are
overwhelming.
she
came
in
for...
this
judge
had
granted
her
a
divorce
and
granted
her
custody
of
her
child.
she
came
in
to
file
an
employment
application
with
him.
he
told
her
that
her
father
was
asking
him
to
take
custody
of
the
child
away
from
her.
he
then
forcibly
physically
orally
raped
her
and
told
her
not
to
say
anything
about
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
there
are
four
elements
to
a
242
offense,
of
which
color
of
law
is
one,
and
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
made
specific
is
another,
wilfulness
is
a
third
and,
of
course,
the
commission
of
the
acts
alleged
is
a
fourth.
as
we
understood
and
as
we
brought
this
case
to
this
court,
the
issue
was
the
first,
the
second
that
i
identified,
which
is,
was
the
right
violated
here
a
right
that
has
been
made
specific,
and
our
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
think
that
it's...
i
suppose
maybe
i
haven't
thought
of
this
closely
enough.
i
don't
think
it's
required
for
us
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
any
other
determinations.
this
case
was
presented
to
the
panel
on
all
issues,
and
they
were
all
denied.
they
went
to
the
en
banc
court
on
two
issues,
and
the
en
banc
court
i
think
has
disposed
of
this
case.
there
is
not
the
slightest
intimation
in
this
case
that
the
en
banc
court
was
inclined
to
find
that
this
didn't
exist
under
color
of
law.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
would
never
wilfully
play
dirty
pool.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
in
fact
if
that
is
the
proper
construction,
it
should
be
set
down.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
honor
all
of
your
rules,
whether
they've
been
made
specific
or
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
it
does
in
this
respect.
you
have
to
determine
how
to
give
content
to
the
words,
made
specific,
and
we
think
that
the
made
specific
standard
under
242
and
clearly
established
standard
under
qualified
immunity
cases
are
and
ought
to
be
considered
quite
similarly,
and
that
is
the
test
should
be
the
functional
test
that
this
court
articulated
in
forsyth
v.
mitchell.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
or
whether...
whether
one
familiar
with
the
law
could
have
had
a
legitimate
question
or
better.
as
this
court
said
in
anderson
v.
creighton,
in
light
of
preexisting
law
the
unlawfulness
must
be
made
apparent.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
do.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
do.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
level
of
specificity
that
a
number
of
members
of
the
court
have
raised,
i
think
the
issue
of
how
specific
the
right
has
to
be
was,
in
fact,
a
question
that
was
dealt
with
in
anderson
v.
creighton
where
the
court
said,
well,
the
contours
of
the
right
must
be
sufficiently
clear
that
a
reasonable
official
would
understand
that
what
he
is
doing
violates
that
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
for
sure
you
would,
and
the
way
the
standard
is
made
more
demanding,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
by
the
requirement
of
a
showing
that
the
defendant
acted
with
a
bad
purpose,
with
an
intent
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
really
understand
what
the
fiction
is.
the...
it
is
true
that
in
screws
the...
under
screws
there
is
an
obligation
to
identify
in
the
indictment
the
specific
right
violated
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
violated.
the
government
in
screws
chose
to
allege
that
the
right
violated
was
the
deprivation
of
a
right
to
have
a
trial
and
a
conviction
before
punishment.
it
may
be,
we
don't
know
why,
that
that's
because
screws
was
indicted
and
decided
before
rochin
and
ingraham
and
youngburg
and
vitek
and
cruzan.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
exactly
right,
and
what
this
court
said
in
screws,
and
i
quote,
it
is
not
necessary
that
you...
to
show
or
prove
that
the
defendant
was
thinking
in
constitutional
terms
at
the
time
of
the
incident.
you
may
find
that
the
defendant
acted
with
reckless
and
specific
intent
even
if
you
find
that
he
had
no
real
familiarity
with
the
constitution--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
what
the
court
said
was,
if
i
can
just
continue,
that
you
had
to
show...
it's
not
material
whether
they
were
thinking
in
constitutional
terms,
but
you
have
to
show
that
their
aim
was
not
to
enforce
the
law
but
to
"deprive
the
citizen
of
a
right,
and
that
right
was
protected
by
the
constitution.
"
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
absolutely
right,
and
that
is
the
way
this
court
has
construed
that
language.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
was
in
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--what
it
reads
is,
for
example,
if
you
just
take
the
way...
just
look
at
the
way
in
which
screws
was
presaged
in
classic
and
applied
in
guest,
which
was
decided
afterwards,
in
both
of
those
cases
the
constitutional
right
involved...
in
classic
it
was
the
right
that
the
federal
constitution
protected
voting
in
a
primary
election,
and
in
guest
it
was
the
right
to
travel.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
actual
constitutional
right
was
announced
by
the
supreme
court
in
that
case,
and
that's
why
in
screws,
referring
to
classic,
the
supreme
court
said
it's
not
necessary
that
the
defendant
be
thinking
in
constitutional
terms.
you
must
prove
that
he
intended
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
a
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it
would
have
to
be
more
than
beat
up
the
citizen.
you
would
have
to
prove
either
that
he
acted...
by
not
understanding
the
constitution
he
acted
in
reckless
disregard
of
a
right
which
has
been
made
so
specific
that
the
unlawfulness
under
that
right
"would
be
apparent"--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
