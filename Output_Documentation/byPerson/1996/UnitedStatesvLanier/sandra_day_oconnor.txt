well,
maybe...
maybe...
the
instructions
here
certainly
called
for
more,
did
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
called
for
physical
abuse
of
a
serious,
substantial
nature
involving
physical
force,
mental
coercion,
bodily
injury,
or
emotional
damage
which
is
shocking
to
the
conscience,
so
clearly
this
instruction
envisioned
something
much
more
serious
than
passing
some
de
minimis
line.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
instruction
was
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
the
problem
you'd
have
is
that
virtually
every
arrest
where
handcuffs
are
put
on,
or
anything
of
the
sort,
would
result
in
a
federal
case
as
well
as
any
ordinary
excessive
force
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
that
has
to
be
a
concern,
of
course.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
may
not
affect
this
case
because
of
the
instruction
here,
but
i
think
this
issue
is
terribly
important,
whether
it's
just
some
de
minimis
threshold
that's
left
out,
or
is
it
something
more.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
prefer
that
you'd
get
right
down
to
what
the
heart
of
the
standard
is
and
then
talk
about
the
facts
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
it
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
that
you
conduct
under
section
1983
for
qualified
immunity?
isn't
that
sufficient
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
shouldn't
that
be
sufficient
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
it
is.
