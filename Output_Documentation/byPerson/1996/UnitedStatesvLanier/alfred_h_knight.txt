mr.
alfred
h.
knight
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me
that
the
exceptional
aspect
of
this
case
from
a
factual
standpoint,
as
a
242
case,
is
that
the
respondent
was
convicted
of
offenses
involving
the
spontaneous
use
of
physical
force,
but
as
a
public
official
he
had
no
legitimate
authority
to
impose
force
on
citizens.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
your
honor,
i
think
it--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
believe,
your
honor,
it
goes
in
a
sense
to
all
three
possible
issues
here.
it
certainly
goes
to
the
color
of
law
issue
in
the
sense
that
within
the
language
of
the
screws
case
he
could
not
have
been
acting
under
the
pretense
of
exercising
his
legitimate
authority
when
he
committed
the--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
believe
you
could
dispose
of
that
issue,
but
i
believe
that
in
addressing
the
due
process
issue
there
would
have
to
be
a
finding
of
state
action
in
connection
with
this
conduct,
and
state
action
is
in
my
mind
so
closely
allied
with
the
concept
of
acting
under
color
of
law,
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
this
court
to
enunciate
a
due
process
violation
without
addressing
the
question
of
whether
the
conduct
could
be
considered
state
action,
which
would
be
very
close
to
determining
whether
it
was
action
committed
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
yes.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
well--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
in
determining
how
specific
the
due
process
right
must
be
articulated,
or
have
been
previously
articulated,
the
court
would
address
the
question
of
in
what
context
is
the
assault
conducted?
in
other
words,
is
assault
per
se
by
someone
who
happens
to
be
a
public
official
a
due
process
violation?
i
would
contend
that
that's
too
broad,
that
that's
beyond
the
ambit
of
what
screws
had
in
mind,
and
that
therefore
the
governmental
context
in
which
the
assault
was
conducted
would
have
to
be
determined,
which
to
my
mind
brings
you
back
to
the
question
of
the
state
action
and
the
governmental
context
in
which
the
assault
was
committed.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
well,
i
do
believe,
your
honor,
that
as
an
abstract
proposition
certainly
you
could
decide
the
due
process
issue
if
you
felt
that
the
due
process
issue
could
be
determined
without
reference
to
considering
the
governmental
context
in
which
the
assault
occurred.
if
you
adopt
the
government's
view
in
this
case
that
unjustified
interference
with
physical
integrity,
which
i
take
it
is
coextensive
with
assault,
if
you
decide
that
that
is
a
definite
enough
statement
of
due
process
violation
to
pass
muster,
then
i
would
agree
that
you
would
not
have
to
consider
state
action
or
the
governmental
context
in
which
the
assault
occurred.
but
my
fundamental
contention
in
this
case
is
that
that
definition
that
has
been
proposed
by
the
government
is
far
broader
than
any
definition
certainly
this
court
has
undertaken
and,
in
fact,
i
think
is
contrary
to
several
holdings
of
this
court,
or
certainly
to
the
spirit
and
thrust
and
intent
of
a
number
of
decisions
that
have
been
rendered
by
this
court.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
cannot,
your
honor.
it's
quite
difficult
to
conjure
that
up,
and
i've
tried
to
do
that,
and
i've
been
asked
those
hypothetical
questions
along
the
way
in
these
appeals,
and
i
cannot.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
suppose,
your
honor,
you
do
get
situations
where
there
is
not
custody
in
the
full
sense
of
an
arrest
and
something
happening
after
the
arrest.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
that
that
is
the
broad
issue.
i
believe
that
the
case
law
has
so
far
by
this
court
been
in
terms
of
injuries
that
occur
while
in
custody.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
on
the
basis
that
i
initially
suggested,
which
is
that
a
judge
has
no
authority
conferred
by
the
state
to
assault
or
restrain
or
subdue
citizens,
and
therefore--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--he
says
i
would
rule
against
you
unless
you
submit
to
my
advances.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
your
honor,
that
is
a
use
i
would
think
possibly
of
governmental
power.
it
may
get
back,
and
i
know
we've
got
a
problem
with
color
of
law
here.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
under
color
of
law,
because
i
think
under
color
of
law
within
the
meaning
of
screws
is
a
purported
or
pretended
exercise
of
actual
authority.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
well--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
would
make
the
distinction
that
there's
a
difference
between
an
extortive
use
of
power,
or
an
extortive
use
of
position
where
you
say,
i'm
strong
enough
to
force
you
to
do
this
on
the
one
hand,
and
saying
as
a
judge
i
have
the
authority
to
sentence
you
to
be
assaulted
by
me.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
oh,
i--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--if
your
honor
please,
i
think
there
has
been
some
misconception
about
what
happened
during
those
archie
assaults,
which
are
certainly
the
most
serious
assaults
in
the
case.
what
happened
was,
in
the
first
interview,
at
the
outset
of
the
interview
the
respondent
said,
your
father
has
indicated
an
interest
in
filing
a
change
of
custody
petition,
and
i
can't
discuss
that
with
you.
that
was
just...
that
was
a
statement
of
fact
that
as
far
as
we
know
was
a
true
statement
of
fact,
and
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
it
has
been
said
well,
that
was
an
implied
threat.
there
was
an
interview
that
was
subsequently
conducted.
the
assault
itself
was
a
pure
exercise
of
physical
force
that
did
not
involve
any
such--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--well,
i
would
say
first
of
all
that
that
situation
is
distinguishable
from
the
case
raised
in
that
there
was
no
pending
case.
that--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--he
would
have
the...
he
would
be
a
judge
who
could
have
determined
custody
had
the
petition
been
filed.
in
the...
as
the
facts
developed,
another
judge
decided
that
custody
issue,
and
that
was
a
consensual
decree
that
vivian
archie
agreed
to
which
was
brought
to
and
signed
by
a
different
judge.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
think
an
explicit
threat
to
use
judicial
power
in
a
pending
case
would
come
within
the
requirement
of
an
exercise
of
state
power
that
resulted
in
the
harm.
i
don't
deny
that.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
not
in
the
least.
that
was
not--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
think
the...
they
did
say
that.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
think
what
that
meant,
as
i
interpret
factually
what
happened
in
this
case,
is
a
little
bit
deceptive.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
they
use
that
terminology,
yes.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
but
i
would
say
that--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--well,
i
would
say...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
that
phrase
was
used.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
but
i
would
insist
that
the
proper
phrase
would
be
misuse
of
authority,
not
misuse
of
power
in
the
sense
in
which
the
government
meant
it,
which
was
misuse
of
his
status
as
a
judge,
which
for
the
most
part,
to
the
extent
there
was
any
alleged
misuse,
simply
was
a
subjective
feeling
on
the
part
of
these
women
that
they
would
not
report
these
assaults
because
he
was
a
judge.
i
mean,
it
had
to
do
mostly
with
his
status
as
a
judge.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
well,
it
is
more
apparent
in
that
there...
it
is
apparent
at
all,
or
that
they
could
be
some
argument--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--made,
but
i
will--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--well--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
didn't
mean
to
acknowledge
that
the
jury
could
have
construed
his
statement--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--which
is
a
conversational
statement,
as
a
threat.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
they
were
not
asked
to
anyway.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
that's
the
way
i
draw
the
line,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--no--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--in
terms
of
judicial
authority--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--which
i
thought--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--no.
no,
i
don't
think
it...
you
see,
the
authority
that
they
talked
about
in
this
case
was
not
surgically
confined
to
he
is
a
judge.
it
had
to
do
with
the
fact
he
is
a
powerful
political
figure.
he's
significant
in
the
community.
people
won't
listen
to
me
if
i
report
him.
it's
the
sort
of
reaction
that
you
could
have
to
any
prominent
citizen,
and
certainly
if
that's
the
test,
then
any
assault
by
almost
any
public
official
or
public
employee
could
be
subjected
to
that
kind
of
analysis.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
if
he
has
ordered
her
into
his
office,
let's
say,
we
need
to
have
a
pretrial
conference
in
your
case,
or--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--oh,
i
concede
that
if
there
is
an
exercise
of
state-granted
power
and
physical
injury
ensues,
i
don't
know
what
the
degree
of
physical
injury
need
be,
but
i
don't
deny--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--theoretically.
i
know
of
no
case
law
that
says
that,
but
theoretically
that
could
happen.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
you
see,
your
honor--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--all
right.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
if
it
is
genuine
state
action--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--particularly
the
fourth
element
of
that
hypothetical,
your
honor,
would
have
to
convince
me,
but
i
don't
know
what
the
constitution...
i
don't
know
what
that
constitution--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
don't
think...
i
think...
i
think
there's...
the
only
difference
there
would
be
is
that
if
there
is
sexual
abuse,
that
would
be
a
sort
of
a
continuum
of
the
exercise
of
force
that
began
the
situation
as
opposed
to
a
policeman
that
simply
beats
up
rodney
king
and
says
this
whole
process
was
an
exercise
of
legitimate
state
authority
in
which
i
was
subduing,
trying
to
arrest
him,
and
trying
to
defend
myself.
but
if
i
could,
your
honor
has
mentioned
screws,
and
we
have
not,
i
don't
think
really
talked
about
the
screws
aspects
of
this,
because
my
reading
of
screws
would
say
that
what
the
government
is
doing
in
this
case
in
defining
this
due
process
crime
is
essentially
what
the
screws
court,
seven
of
the
justices
including
the
majority
and
dissenting
justices,
feared
would
happen,
were
concerned
would
happen,
and
did
not
want
to
happen.
and
that
is,
taking
the
concept
of
liberty
interest
as
it
floats
through
the
case
law
and
developing
out
of
that
evolving
standards
of
criminal
liability
which
would
result
in
ex
post
facto
judicial
creation
of
crime,
in
perhaps
coopting
for
federal
prosecution
large
areas
of
state
criminal
prosecution,
and
of
depriving
defendants
of
fair
notice
of
offenses
that--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--well,
it
does
not
underlay
those
concerns
as
they
were
expressed
in
the
screws
opinion.
i
mean,
as
i
read
the
screws
opinion,
the
screws
opinion
is
saying
we
don't
need
to
be
developing
ongoing
principles
of
criminal
liability
based
upon
all
of
these
circuit
courts
and
the
supreme
court
deciding
all
sorts
of
different
fact-specific
situations,
and
as
the
court
put
it,
referring
the
citizen
to
a
library,
a
law
library
in
order
to
determine
what
is
or
is
not
criminal
action.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
think
that
was
part
of
it,
but
i
also
think
that
there
was
great
concern
in
that
opinion
for
the
ex
post
factor
problems.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
well,
i
think
the
court
was
looking
for
a
kind
of
definiteness
that
was
quite
fact-specific.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
well,
reasonably
definite
implies
that
there
can
be
conflict
among
decisions
to
some
degree.
there
can
be
questions
of
whether
a
precedent
really
and
truly
does
factually
apply
to
a
situation,
and
i
think
the
court--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--it
is
the
same
inquiry.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
it's
the
same
inquiry.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
think
it's
a
stricter
inquiry.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
that--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
think
you
ask
it
if
you
look
at
the
screws
case
at
a
level
that
is
quite
fact-specific.
i
think--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--you
know,
i
will
say,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
screws
case
itself,
it
might
not.
the
screws
case
itself
says
the
fact
that
a
prisoner
is
assaulted,
even
murdered,
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right
under
this
statute.
i
think
the
screws
court
had
in
mind
something
more
specific
than
physical
harm
rendered
even
in
custody.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
in
the
course
of
being
transferred--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--there
is
then
a--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--an
assault,
yes.
i
think
that's
close
to
it.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
but
i
think
what
the
screws
court
had
in
mind
was
that
a
casual
beating
by
a
deputy
sheriff
just
for
the
heck
of
it
and
with
no
specific
intent
except
he
liked
to
beat
up
prisoners
was
not
a
violation
of
any
due
process
right
because
you
had
to
have
a
right
to
deprive
him
of
his
trial
by
a
jury
in
lieu
of
trial
by
ordeal.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
mean,
they
were
dealing
in
quite
specific
deprivations
in
that
case--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
i
believe--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--i
believe
the
structure
of
the
opinion,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
a
section
on
deprivation
of
due
process
followed
by
a
section
of
under
color
of
law,
new
paragraph,
and
the
new
paragraph
deals
with
the
problem
of
the
balance
of
state-federal
law
enforcement
so
that
you're
not
getting
into
turning
over
state
criminal
law
enforcement
and
assault
cases
en
masse
to
the
federal
government
and
they...
that's
where
that
sentence
appears,
and
the
end
of
that
paragraph
refers
both
to
color
of
law
and
due
process,
as
i
recall,
but--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--that
they
had
certain
constitutional
provisions--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--well,
i
think
the...
interestingly,
the
instruction
to
the
jury
was
quite
specific
in
terms
of
a
deprivation
of
trial
rights.
i
mean,
that's
where
the
idea
came
from
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
his--
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
--well,
i
think
it's
certainly
a
fiction
in
terms
of
thinking
that
these
deputies
were...
had
the
constitution
in
mind.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
but
i'm
not
sure
it
was
a
fiction
in
terms
of
the
facts,
because
there
was
evidence
that
the
deputy
had
said,
we're
going
to
get
this
guy,
and
they
arrested
him
under
some
pretext
and
killed
him
before
he
could
be
tried,
so
i
think
there
were
facts
from
which
a
jury
could
conclude
that
in
a
factual
sense
they
really
were
depriv...
they
really
did
intend
to
deprive
him
of
legal
process
and
kill
him
before
he
could
be
found
innocent,
but
i
mean,
that's...
as
i
read
the
case,
that's
what
was
going
on.
and
i
do
think
that
the
concern
of
all
seven
of
the
justices
that...
well,
seven
of
the
nine,
was
that
this
statute
might
be
so
vague
as
to
be
almost
subject
to
due
process
objection
on
its
face,
and
i
think
the
intent
was
to
construe
it
very
narrowly
to
require
very
specific
constitutional
violations
and
intent
factually
to
violate
those
rights.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
yes.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
well,
if
there
were
facts
from
which
a
jury
could
find
an
intent
to
deprive
her
of
a
trial
by
jury
and
to
punish
her
by
some
other
means,
or
to...
whatever.
mr.
alfred
h.
knight
yes.
that's
conceivably
so.
i
know
my
red
light's
on.
