we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1717,
united
states
v.
david
lanier.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
have
to--
--mr.
waxman,
two
of
the
concurring
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
believe
felt
that
the
oral
rape
should
be
sustained
but
that
the
misdemeanors
simply,
i
believe,
weren't
under
color
of
state
law.
does
the
government
take
any
position
on
that
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
may
be
right.
i'm
not
sure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
serious
and
substantial,
as
you're
putting
it,
is
almost
inconsistent
to
me
with
the
concept
of
a
misdemeanor,
which
is
what
some
of
these
convictions
were.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
a
real
element
of
vagueness
in
all
of
this,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
waxman,
that's--
--that's
not
clear
at
all
whether...
he
could
have
been
answering
in
response
to
state
law,
federal
law...
a
vague
question
like
that
doesn't
prove
much.
and
it's
not
true
anyway,
is
it?
everybody
doesn't
have
a
federal...
we're
talking
here
about
a
federal
constitutional
right.
the
statute
requires
deprivation
of
any
right
secured
or
protected
by
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so...
is
it
then
your
position
that
anything
a
government,
anything
a
judge
does
in
the
course
of
his
office
is
necessarily
under...
during
working
hours
is
under
color
of
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
knight,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
too...
justice
stevens'
hypothesis
isn't
too
far
from
what
actually
happened
here--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--with
the
case
of
the
oral
rape.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
a
jury
could
conclude
from
that
series
of
events
that
there
was
an
implied
threat
to
use
judicial
power
if
there
was
no
submission.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
did
have
the
authority
to
determine
custody,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
one
can
distinguish
on
that
basis
the
misdemeanor
types
of
things
from
the
oral
rape,
don't
you
think,
that
the
use
of
status
as
a
judge
is
much
more
apparent
in
the
oral
rape
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
it
is
on,
and
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
waxman,
though,
you're
not...
qualified
immunity
is
a
civil
concept,
really.
certainly
you
might
want
a
more
demanding
standard
in
the
area
of
the
criminal
law,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
as
justice
kennedy
says
there's
a
certain
fiction
about
all
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
