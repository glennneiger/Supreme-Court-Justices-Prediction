mr.
waxman,
the
idea
of
the
fourth
amendment
does
go
way,
way
back,
even
to
boyd
v.
united
states,
of
any
invasion
of
a
person's
personal
security.
is
that
not
so?
and
i
thought
in
your
very
first
remarks
you
mentioned
the
fourth
amendment,
didn't
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
you
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
you
just
mentioned
1983
in
connection
with
242,
and
it
would
help
me
very
much
if
you
would
clarify
two
things
about
the
relationship.
is
everything
that
would
be
susceptible
to
a
1983
charge
also
indictable
under
242,
and
is
there
any
difference
in
the
state
of
mind
requirement
in
the
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
understand
the
abstract
concept,
but
frankly
i
don't
understand
when
one
intentionally
beats
another
human,
to
take
an
example,
what
is
wilful
any
more
than
intentional
in
that
context.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman...
mr.
waxman,
wasn't
she
essentially
arrested,
confined,
if
we're
talking
about
vivian
archer?
i
didn't
understand
your
departing
from
the
fourth
amendment
so
swiftly,
because
it
seemed
to
me
what
was
very
clear
is
that
that
woman
was
locked
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman--
[laughter]
mr.
waxman,
you
said...
in
comparing
1983
you
said
there's
a
stronger
intent
requirement.
what
about
qualified
immunity?
that's
a
big
thing
in
1983.
does
it
figure
in
242?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so--
--mr.
knight,
do
you
think
that
there's
any
violent
assault
by
a
public
official,
any
at
all,
against
a
free
person
as
opposed
to
someone
who
is
in
custody,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
242?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
knight,
let
me
ask
you
a
fact
specific,
then.
suppose
this
woman
were
in
a
holding
cell
awaiting
her
trial.
she's
taken
out
by
a
police
officer.
she's
in
the
corridor.
the
judge
grabs
her,
takes
her
into
his
chambers,
and
he
rapes
her.
would
that
qualify
for
a
242
prosecution?
