unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
do
that
all
across
the
board,
i
suppose,
general
dellinger,
simply
perhaps
render
the
thing
kind
of
a
nullity
if
it
incorporated
that
sort
of
a
provision
in
every
appropriations
item.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
president
then
could
veto
such
subsequent
bill
and
that
would
then
require
a
larger
vote
of
congress
to
override
the
veto.
i
mean,
it
does
put
them
in
a
different
position
to
that
extent,
perhaps.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
congress
decides
later
on
that
maybe
some
type
of
appropriations
shouldn't
be
subject
to
this
line
item
veto,
so
they
include
passage
in
a
subsequent
bill
saying
that
the
line
item
veto
act
won't
apply
to
a
certain
type
of
appropriation.
that,
of
course,
has
to
go
to
the
president
for
signature,
and
he
then
can
veto
that
and
that
then
would
require
enough
votes
to
override
that
veto.
unknown
speaker
and
to
that
extent
it
kind
of
changes
the
equation.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
all
events,
mr.
dellinger,
you
are
defending
the
line
item
veto
as
it
was
enacted
and
as
it
was
intended
to
work,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
some
point
to
the
argument
that
this
changes
the
legislative
dynamic.
now,
whether
or
not
that
is
sufficient
to
create
a
cause
of
action
or
standing
is
what
we're
here
to
decide.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
your
example
of
the
abc
and
a
small
number
certainly
is
easy
to
understand.
they
can
do
that.
but
isn't
it
true
that
it
the...
it
is
anticipated
that
the
budget
bill
will
include
maybe
hundreds
of
items,
or
a
very
large
number,
and
it's
unlikely
that
you
could
work
out
all
combinations
in
advance,
so
that
for
example
if
a
congressman
was
interested
in
the
navy
yard
in
san
diego
or
something
he
wouldn't
know
whether
that
would
survive.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
isn't
it
true...
isn't
it
true
that
the
typical
bill
is
anticipated
to
have
a
large
number
of
items
and
that
the
abc
example
is
really
not
very
realistic.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then
you
might
have
300
different
congressmen
wanting
to
put
that
rider
on--
unknown
speaker
--that
particular
item.
unknown
speaker
general
dellinger,
it
sounds
to
me
from
what
you've
said
so
far
that
no
one
would
have
standing
because
no
one
would
be
injured,
because
all
choices
are
always
open
to
congress.
in
your
brief,
you
took
the
position
that
this
is
not
a
whether
question
but
a
who
and
a
when
question,
but
now
you
seem
to
say,
well,
there's
nothing
really
that's
changed.
congress
retains
the
power
to
do
anything
it
wants.
unknown
speaker
but
on
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
isn't--
unknown
speaker
--and
isn't
his
argument
that
there
is
a
lack
of
legislative
regularity
that
violates
the
constitution?
isn't
that
what
his
argument
is?
unknown
speaker
just
as
in
the
chadha
case
there
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
in
the
way
the
bill
was
enacted
as
to
chadha.
now,
if
that's
so,
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
regularity
that
is
mandated
on
the
congress,
why
isn't
there
an
injury
now?
unknown
speaker
they
don't.
how...
are
we
talking
about
injury
in
fact?
i
mean,
injury
in
fact?
a
senator
or
congressman
is
sitting
there
with
a
bill
that's
about
this
high
and
says,
i
don't
even...
i've
never
read
this
entire
thing,
frankly,
with
the
budget.
i'm
relying
on
other
people
to
tell
me
everything
in
it,
and
i
can't
figure
out
every
permutation
and
combination,
and
if
you're
telling
me
i'm
supposed
to
go
start
having
special
laws
passed
as
a
factual
matter
i
can't
do
it,
and
so
i'm
injured
in
fact.
now,
why
isn't
that
an
injury
in
fact?
maybe
there
are
prudential
reasons
why
in
certain
circumstances
a
congressman
or
senator
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
such
a
claim
to
have
standing,
but
why
isn't
it
an
injury
in
fact?
unknown
speaker
fine,
so
why
aren't
all
those
things,
which
are
excellent
points,
excellent
reasons
as
to
why
prudential
rules
of
standing
make
it
virtually
impossible
for
such
a
legislator
ever
to
bring
such
a
case,
but
not
constitutional
reasons,
because
there
might
be,
and
is
in
this
instance,
say
the
other
side,
an
injury
in
fact.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
coleman?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
why
the
distinction
between
the
two
cases
isn't
simply
one
of
characterization.
wasn't
the...
weren't
the
kansas
legislators
subjected,
in
effect,
to
the
same
portent
that
the
members
of
congress
is
subjected
to,
however
you
may
want
to
describe
them?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
even
apart
from
that,
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that
on
appeal
the
standing
requirement
is
exactly
the
same,
so
the
fact
that
it
began
in
a
state
court
and
the
fact
that
no
one
objected
up
to
a
certain
point
still
leaves
the
jurisdictional
necessity
to
deal
with.
unknown
speaker
but
not
for
that
reason.
unknown
speaker
general
dellinger,
did
all
of
the
judges
weigh
in
on
the
standing
question
with...
some
of
them
didn't
discuss
it.
i--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
was
on
the
way
to
throwing
the
case
out
for
want
of
a...
because
it
was
a
political
question.
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
ripeness
question
the
very
example
that
you
gave,
you
said
it's
a
ripeness
question.
somebody
eventually
can
sue,
but
who
could
sue
if
the
president
cancels
the
aid
to,
say,
jordan?
who
could
sue
after
the
fact?
unknown
speaker
oh,
and
if
there
is
nobody,
i
suppose
your
response
would
be
then
there's
been
nobody
harmed,
and
no
harm
done.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
you
were
acknowledging--
unknown
speaker
--that
there
would
be
many
cases
where
no
one...
no
one
would
have
standing.
unknown
speaker
do
you
also
agree
that
ripeness
really
is
not
a
concern
for
us
at
this
point?
doesn't
the
statutory
authorization
take
care
of
the
prudential
concern
about
ripeness?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
that's
different
from
ripeness.
unknown
speaker
but
we
might
have
passed
a
statute
that
said
the
senators
from
iowa
on
hog-farming
matters
should
have
only
a
half-a-vote.
would
they
have
standing
to
challenge
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
limit
it
to
salary
matters.
unknown
speaker
so
i
guess
the
question
here
is
whether
there
really
is
that
kind
of
an
injury
to
the
legislature,
and
you're
very--
unknown
speaker
--you
forcefully
argue
no.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
at
this
point
whether
the
president
will
ever
exercise
this
kind
of
cancellation.
i
mean,
it's
something
that
could
be
politically
costly
to
him,
just
as
it's
politically
costly
to
congress
to
do
some
of
these
things.
unknown
speaker
mr....
general
dellinger,
do
you
think
ripeness
is
a
matter
just,
you
know,
prudential,
or
does
it
have
some
sort
of
article
iii
component?
unknown
speaker
but
the
basis
for
objecting
to
the
cancellation
is
that
there
is
an
irregularity,
an
unconstitutional
regularity
in
the
legislative
process.
unknown
speaker
and
mr.
morrison
is
going
to
tell
us
that
exists
now.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
the
dynamic
of
the
legislative
process
has
not
changed
as
of
this
point?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
that
was
the
injury
that
they're
alleging,
that
they're
bringing
here.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
general,
couldn't
we
recharacterize
the
provision
in
this
way,
not
merely
in
a
vague
way
that
the
dynamics
have
changed,
which
everybody
agrees
that
they
have,
but
by
saying
that
as
a
result
of
this
bill
unless
congress
in,
let's
say,
a
given
appropriations
act
agrees
to
exempt
every
single
item
in
that
act
from
the
effect
of
this
statute,
which
is
highly
unlikely,
then
when
any
given
member
votes
on
a
bill
with
those
provisions
on
it,
he
does
not
know
in
the
sense
that
he
has
traditionally
known,
what
it
is
that
he
is
voting
on
that
will,
depending
on
the
vote,
either
become
law
or
not
become
law.
he
does
not
simply
have
a
bill
in
front
of
him
which
is
going
to
be
subject
to
a,
in
effect
an
up
or
down
determination,
and
that's
something
more
than
just
dynamic,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
he
does
not
know
the
combination
of
provisions
which
his
up
or
down
determination
will
either,
in
the
old
sense,
require
the
president
to
act
on
up
or
down.
that's
gone.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
the
lump
sum
appropriation
act
simply
does
not
give
the
president
in
effect
a
definitive
power
to
eliminate
a
spending
authority.
under
this
bill,
under
the
act
in
question;
once
the
president
has
acted,
he
can't
unring
the
bell.
under
a
lump
sum
appropriation,
he
can
unring
the
bell
because
he
can
change
his
mind
in
midstream.
unknown
speaker
general
dellinger--
unknown
speaker
--general
dellinger,
i
assume
that
none
of
these
consequences
to
the
legislator,
the
uncertainty
about
how
to
vote,
and
the
alteration
of
the
dynamics
and
so
forth,
none
of
those
things
really
occur
if,
indeed,
the
respondents
are
correct
that
the
exercise
of
the
power
given
to
the
president
here,
the
cancellation,
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution
as
constituting
an
unlawful
delegation
of
legislative
power,
so
really
all
we're
talking
about
is
the
uncertainty
created
by
an
unconstitutional
statute,
or
an
unconstitutional
provision
in
a
statute,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
which
i
assume
legislators
often
face.
unknown
speaker
they
have
to
decide
whether
to
vote
for
a
statute
that
has
an...
what
they
believe
is
an
unconstitutional
provision
in
it.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
on
the
question
of
timing,
in
my
hypothetical
example
about
giving
the
senator
from
iowa
a
half-a-vote,
would
he
have
to
wait
until
the
statute
was
passed
before
he'd
have
standing
to
challenge
that
rule,
or
the...
at
least
a
bill
was
introduced,
or
could
he
just
challenge
it
right
away,
saying
you're
diluting
my
vote?
unknown
speaker
so
what's
the
difference
here
on
the
question
of
timing?
if
this
change
does
change
the
legislative
process
in
a
similar
way,
and
i
know
you
disagree,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
does,
why
can't
they
challenge
it
right
away,
those
who
are
adversely
affected
by
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that--
unknown
speaker
--that's
irrespective
of
timing.
unknown
speaker
general
dellinger,
you
mentioned
the
adam
clayton
powell
case.
are
you
making
a
distinction
based
on
a
person
or
particular
group
being
targeted
for
adverse
action,
as
was
true
there
and
would
be
true
of
the
iowans
who
were
given
only
half
a
vote,
as
opposed
to
this
situation,
where
they're
all
treated...
they
treat
themselves
alike?
there's
no--
unknown
speaker
--well,
on
the
merits,
may...
since
you've
had
almost
no
time
to
address
it,
may
i
ask
whether
you
think
that
this
line
item
veto
act
gives
any
useful
guidance
or
context
for
the
president
to
exercise
this
veto?
there
are
three
general
criteria,
but
they
are
so
general
that
they
appear
to
apply
across
the
board
to
everything,
and
is
that
enough
for
an
adequate
delegation
of
congress'
powers?
unknown
speaker
no,
aren't
they
broader
than
anything
we've
ever
held--
unknown
speaker
--could
suffice?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
another
example?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you've
got
public
convenience
and
necessity.
unknown
speaker
you've
got
public
convenience
and
necessity.
that
certainly
is
broad,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
he's
given
no
guidance.
you
know,
anything
that
isn't
spent
obviously
can
reduce
the
deficit.
how
does
that
guide
as
between
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
or
that
it
be
in
the
national
interest?
unknown
speaker
that
is
such
a
broad,
vague
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
congress
had
gone
further
and
not
simply
limited
this
to
appropriations,
but
said
under
these
same
three
standards
the
president
could
cancel
any
provision
of
a
bill
that
he
didn't
like?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
prior
acts,
but
just
current
acts.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not.
you're
also
talking
about
the
tax
law,
and
so
assuming
everything
in
your
favor
up
to
that
point,
what
do
we
do
about
the
fact
that
it
says
that
the
president
can
simply
set
aside
a
tax
law,
any
tax
law
that
affects
fewer
than
a
certain
number
of
people?
i
mean,
how
is
there
a
sufficient
intelligible
principle
for
that,
and
if
that's
no
good,
isn't
the
whole
thing
no
good?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
might
say,
look,
tax
loopholes
basically
help
richer
people.
spending
basically
helps
poorer
people,
and
we
don't
know
if
congress
would
have
passed
one
without
the
other.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
general
dellinger.
mr.
morrison,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
on
the
tax
benefit
part,
the
legislation
instructs
the
joint
committee
to
flag
every
one
of
these
limited
tax
items,
where
fewer
than
100...
fewer
than
10
benefit.
is
there
anything
just
in
that
flagging
requirement
so
that
people
could
know
what
those
tax
measures
are?
is
there
anything
unconstitutional
about
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
before
we
get
too
deeply
into
the
merits,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
standing--
unknown
speaker
--the
standing
issue?
i
cannot
think
of
a
case
in
which
an
individual
federal
officer,
in
200
years,
has
brought
suit,
claiming
a...
a
derogation
of
his
powers
as
a
federal
officer.
i'm
trying
to
understand
how
far
the
principle
you're
asking
us
to...
to
adopt
would
go.
what
about
a
district
court
judge,
who,
in
a
lawsuit,
in
order
to
preserve
the
school
system
that...
that
he's
decreed,
in
order
to
eliminate
segregation,
imposes
a
tax.
he
is
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
says
he
has
no
power
to
impose
a
tax.
the
losing
party
does
not
appeal.
does
the
district
judge
have
a
cause
of
action--
unknown
speaker
--against
the
court
of
appeals
for
taking
away
his
power
to
impose
a
tax?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
irrelevant
unless
they
have
a
personal
interest
in
the
power
that
they
exercise.
unknown
speaker
and
you...
and
you
say
that
the
district
judge
does
not.
unknown
speaker
all
of
the
things
that
the
constitution
gives
a
right
to
are
not
necessarily
enforceable
in
court.
the
constitution
also
gives
members
of
congress
the
right
to
be
admitted
to
congress
if
they're
qualified.
but
it's
very
clear
that
we
don't
pass
upon
that.
unknown
speaker
but
stand...
standing
is...
is
an
article
iii
proposition,
too.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
rightness
is
a
factor
that
goes
into
the
article
iii
calculus?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
can
i
try
a
few
other
examples?
i
don't
understand
the...
the
scope
of
the
principle
you're
arguing
from.
what
about
a
bill
that
is
originated
in
the
senate,
which...
which
an
individual
member
of
the
house
believes
is
a
tax
measure.
unknown
speaker
and,
therefore,
violates
the
origination
clause.
does
that
individual
member
of
the
house
have
a
right
to
come
to
this
court
immediately,
saying
i've
been
deprived
of
my
power
to
vote
on
the
original
measure?
unknown
speaker
yes.
my...
my
question
is
as
a
constitutional
matter.
so
that...
that...
that
distinction
is
irrelevant.
my
question
is
constitutionally,
can...
can
the
individual
member
of
the
house
sue?
unknown
speaker
article
iii.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
president
is
about
to
enter
into
an
executive
agreement
with
a
foreign
country
regarding
the
panama
canal,
regarding
nato,
regarding
whatever,
and
an
individual
member
of
the
senate
believes
that
this
is
in
fact
a
matter
that
should
be
subject
to
treaty,
and
therefore,
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
right
to
vote
on
the
conclusion
of
that
treaty;
does
that
matter
come
before
us?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
summary
disposition.
unknown
speaker
so
i
have
to
think
of
something
else
other
than
standing
to...
to
prevent
these
matters
from
being
brought
immediately
into
the
court?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
you
mean...
when
you
say
no,
you
mean
you
have
to
think
of
something
else
other
than
constitutional
standing;
there
could
be
prudential
standing?
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
not
here,
because
congress
can
always
wipe
that
out
by
providing
that
the...
providing
a
right
to
sue.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
about
the
situation
of
a
bill
passed
by
congress
that
we
would
all
agree
is
an
improper
delegation
of
legislative
authority
to
the
executive
branch.
has
a
member
of
congress
been
injured
by
that
improper
delegation?
can
they
come
sue?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we're
trying
to
explore
with
you
how
far
your
theory
would
take
you.
unknown
speaker
so
they
would
have
been
able
to
come
in,
in
mistretta,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
a
concern
that
if
this
court
is
routinely
invited
to
be
the
referee
for
legislative
matters
that
the
legislators
themselves
will
not
take
the
constitutional
positions
that
they
ought
to
take
within
their
own
branch
of
the
government.
and
that
is
part
of
the
standing
rules...
of
the
standing
rules
that
inform
separation
of
powers.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
it
only
a
law
that
can
be
challenged
that
way?
why
not
the
leadership's
putting
together
of
a
bill
that
contains
an
unconstitutional
provision?
and
the
member
of
congress
says,
i
don't
know
how
to
vote
on
this
bill
because
one
of
the
provisions,
in
my
view,
is
unconstitutional,
and
i
don't
know
whether
i
am
voting
for
all
of
it
without
that
provision
or
all
of
it
including
that
provision.
i
am
in
legislative
doubt,
just
as
you
claim
your
clients
are
here.
and
therefore,
i
ought
to
have
a
right
to
come
into
court
immediately
to
determine
whether
that
provision
is
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
i
disagree.
it
is
based
on
legislative
doubt.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
mountain,
if
you
are
correct,
that
this
provision
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
if
this
provision
is
unconstitutional,
the...
the
congressman
can
vote
for
whatever
he
likes,
because
he
knows
that
the
president's
cancellation
will
be
ineffective.
unknown
speaker
because
of
constitutional
doubt.
what
the
case
boils
down
to
is
constitutional
doubt.
unknown
speaker
well,
help
me,
mr.
morrison,
i'm...
i'm
a
little
puzzled
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
i
didn't
understand
the
doubt
to
be
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
but
rather
doubt
as
to
what
the
president
might
do
with
the
particular
mix
that
comes
to
him.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
understand
the
constitutional
doubt
argument.
but
he
can't
do
anything
with
that
mix
if
the
cancellation
provision
is
unconstitutional.
if
you
are
right
that
it's
an
unconstitutional
delegation,
there
is
no
problem
whatever.
the
whole
thing
boils
down
to
the
constitutional
doubt
of
whether
the
cancellation
provision
is
valid.
unknown
speaker
no,
but...
but
isn't
justice
scalia
correct
in
the
way
he
states
your
position?
i...
i
want
to
understand
this.
isn't
it
your
position
and
your
client's
position
that
there
is
now
a
cloud,
a
sword
of
damocles,
hanging
over
the
legislation,
that
the
dynamic
is
altered
because
of
this
constitutional...
constitutionally
questionable
procedure,
and
that
is
what
gives
them
the
standing
now
to
come
in?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
you--
--but
the
rejoinder
to
that
is
that
that's
not
a
problem
if
it's
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well...
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
realize
that.
that...
this
puts
it
all
in
a
different
light
for
me.
[laughter]
mr.
morrison,
how
does
that
differ
from
suppose
congress
had
said,
instead
of
having
this
fancy
arrangement,
the
expenditures
in
all
the
categories
that
it
designated,
that
expenditures
of
that
nature
must
be
covered...
must
be
enrolled
as
a
separate
bill;
would
there
be
any
problem
with
that?
and
wouldn't
that
cause
the
same
difficulty?
unknown
speaker
what
about
something
more
modest,
like
no
riders
on
appropriation
bills?
unknown
speaker
could...
would
there
be
any
problem
about
that
being
constitutional
for...
for
congress
to
restrain
itself
by
doing,
either
through
rules
or
perhaps
a
statute,
saying
that
there
can
be
no
riders
attached
to
an
appropriation
bill?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
let's
go
back
for
a
minute
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
there
being
no
injury
here
if
in
fact
the...
that
would
really
do
away
with
all
of
our
declaratory
judgment
jurisprudence,
would
it
not,
to
accept
that,
if
you...
you
can't
bring
a
declaratory
judgment,
because
if
the
statute
you're
attacking
is
unconstitutional,
they
can't
do
anything
to
you
anyway?
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
go
back
to
another
point?
but
that...
that
would
depend,
would
it
not,
upon
whether
the
assertion
of
standing,
whether
the
personal
injury
you're
alleging,
is
nothing
more
than
your
not
knowing
how
to
vote
because
of
doubt,
because
of
constitutional
doubt?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
isn't
that
going
to
be
true,
going
back
to
an
answer...
an
earlier
answer
to
a
question...
that's
going
to
be
true
even
if
the
very
first
instance
is
challenged
and
nothing
else
happens
in
congress
until
that
challenge
is
decided.
because
as
i
understand
your
position,
if
half
the
congress
is
convinced
that
the
statute
is
un...
or
not
quite
half...
is
convinced
that
it's
unconstitutional
and
the
rest
are
convinced
that
it
is
constitutional,
nobody
is
in
any
doubt.
but
the
process
is
still
going
to
be
affected;
depending
on
one's
opinion
on
constitutionality.
and
as
i
understand
it,
that's
enough
for
your
position
on
injury;
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
uncertainty,
not
doubt?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
mean
i
think
that's
a
valid
distinction.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
doesn't
that
apply
to
a
bill,
just
a
bill
that's
before
congress,
as
i
asked
before,
which
has
in
it
a
provision
that
49
percent
of
congress
think
is
unconstitutional
and
51
percent
think
is
constitutional?
doesn't
that
uncertainty,
doubt,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
doesn't
that
affect
the
legislative
process?
and
shouldn't
they
all
be
able
to
come
here
and
get
us
to
resolve
that
uncertainty
so
they
could
get
about
the
business
of
legislating?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
bill
is
an
identifiable
act,
too.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
an
act
of...
of
one
house
of
congress
instead
of
both.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison--
--okay,
the
answer
to
my
question
is,
if
it
were
determined
in...
if
it
were
determined
in
the...
the...
the
first
instance
before
any
other
legislation
was
considered,
that
wouldn't
give
standing.
if
we
could
assume
that
was
going
to
happen,
there
wouldn't
be
standing.
there's
got
to
be
the
assumption
that
in
fact
there
will
be
an
ongoing
process
of
at
least
more
than
one
bill
which
this...
it
affects?
unknown
speaker
but,
so
far,
they're
injured
only
by
their
own
colleagues.
the
president
has
done
absolutely
nothing.
a
majority
of
the
colleagues
of
the
plaintiffs
have
decided
that
this
law
is
constitutional
and
sound
policy.
isn't...
i
know
that
the
standing
is
a
specialty
for
lawyers,
but
practically
it
is
the
majority
of
the
members
of
congress
that
have
caused
this
injury,
and
not
the
president.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
not
talking
about
prudential;
i'm
talking
about
the
reality
of
who
has
caused
the
injury.
if
there
is
an
injury,
it
hasn't
been
caused
by
the
president.
it
has
been
caused
by
the
members
of
the
house
and
senate.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
isn't
also
the
answer
that
the
president
signed
the
line
item
veto
act,
and
that
is
now
a
law
that
regulates
the
legislative
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
morrison,
your
theory
of
standing
would
seem
to
come
into
play
even
if
the
senate
or
the
house
changed
their
rules
of
operation
to
cut
off
debate
or
anything
else.
it
changes
the
dynamics
of
the
operation
of
the
house--
unknown
speaker
--or
the
senate.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
congress
passes
a
law
and
says,
well,
you
can
sue
on
it
immediately,
just
like
here,
but,
nevertheless,
we're
going
to
change
our
rules.
and
you...
we're
going
to
cut
off
debate
after
5
minutes
and
whatever
it
is.
in
your
view,
they'd
be
able
to
file
suit
in
court,
because
the
dynamics
are
changed?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
a
total
exclusion
of
a
member,
that
deprives
him
of
the
emoluments
of
the
office...
can't
get
paid,
can't
take
a
seat...
that
may
well
be
different.
unknown
speaker
there
is
also
a
difference,
mr.
morrison,
as
justice
ginsburg
was
suggesting,
between
a
provision
adopted
by
the
whole
body
that
affects
only
an
individual
member
and
a
provision
adopted
by
the
body,
such
as
a
rule
change,
such
as
this
law,
which
affects
all
the
members
of
the
house
and
all
the
members
of
the...
of
the
senate
equal.
isn't
that
a
distinction
that
can
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
there
is
standing?
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't
affect
everybody
equally.
that...
that's
the
reason.
this
is
a
provision
every
member
of
the
house
is
in
the
same
boat,
and
the
house...
the
house
voted
it,
you
know,
by
a
majority
vote.
unknown
speaker
but
the
distinction
between
the
adam
clayton
powell
case,
which
you
brought
up
in
your
brief,
and
the
half
a
vote
for
the
iowans--
unknown
speaker
--every
member
has
a
district.
i
mean,
general
dellinger
recognized
that
the
powell
case,
that
suit
could
be
brought
even
if
the
salary
wasn't
stopped.
i'm
not
allowed
to
be
a
legislator,
or
my
vote
counts
only
half.
the...
the
majority
is...
is
seizing
on
a
particular
person
or
group
of
persons
and
treating
them
adversely.
but
your...
your
example--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
but
the...
the...
you
make
nothing
of
the
distinction
between
we
single
out
a
group
and
treat
them
adversely
and
what
we
do
to
others
we
do
unto
ourselves.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
your...
your...
your
standing
would
apply
even
if
the
voter
voted
for
the
bill.
he'd
still
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
he
be
disqualified?
the
statute...
he'd
be
injured
just
as
much
as
somebody
who
voted
against
the
bill.
i
don't
see
a
distinction
based
on
how
you
vote.
he
might
change
his
mind.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we
don't
look
at
equities.
all
of
that
is
put
to
one
side
with
the
statutory
provision
you
rely
on--
unknown
speaker
--can
i
ask
you
one
question
on
the
merits?
suppose...
imagine
we
have
somewhat
different
laws,
but
two
laws
like
the
following.
the
first
one,
congress
says:
there
follow
a
list
of
1,000
appropriations.
we
delegate
to
the
president
the
authority
to
impound
or
not
to
impound
those
monies.
is
that
objectionable?
the
second
statute
says...
by
the
way,
they
put
in
a
5-day
deadline
for
him
to
make
up
his
mind...
the
second
statute
says:
the
following
are
5
or
50
special
provisions
of
the
tax
code
that
will
benefit
particular
individuals.
we
do
two
things.
we
instruct
the
head
of
the
irs
to
consider
the
merits
of
each
under
ordinary
rule-delegating
powers,
and
then,
within
5
days,
to
adopt
or
to
reject
those
which
he
feels
are
warranted
on
the
basis
of
the
money
available.
now,
what
would
the
constitutional
objection
be
to
either
of
those
bills,
and
why
aren't
they
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
hold
me
to
the...
to
the...
i'm
not
trying
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--it
wouldn't
be--
unknown
speaker
--it
wouldn't
be
surprising...
i
mean,
maybe
it
is...
they
don't
normally
do
it.
but
it...
it
wouldn't
be
surprising
for
congress
to
say
to
the
head
of
the
irs,
we
direct
you
to
consider
the
five
following
measures.
consider
whether
or
not
you
want
to
enact
a
rule
that
will
turn
them
into
law.
decide,
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
then
they
say,
by
the
way,
you
have
to
say
yes
or
no
within
5
days,
and...
and,
by
the
way,
unless
you
actually
say
no,
it's
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
similar
result
with
some
of
those
statutes
that
gave
the
president
authority
to
cease
foreign
aid
when
a
certain
event
should
occur
or,
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--is
that...
is
that
true
of
the
agricultural
statute
they
cite
in
their
reply
brief?
they...
i
think
i
remember
reading
that,
saying
that
statute
is
totally...
put
an
end...
am...
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
strictly
the
5
days?
i
mean
i
don't
know
why
20
years--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
so
that
a
statute
that
said,
whenever
the
president
decides
to
terminate
this
program,
he
may
do
so,
period,
and
that's
the
end
of
it,
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
too?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
worse
that
he
should
be
able
to
repeal
it
and
reenact
it,
repeal
it
and
reenact
it.
you
think...
you--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me
that's
giving
him
even...
even
greater
power.
unknown
speaker
unless
he
has
criteria.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that.
you
can
give
him
criteria
for
terminating
the
law?
he
can
terminate
the
law
so
long
as
he
has
criteria?
unknown
speaker
but
the...
the
theory
is
that
he
wouldn't
be
terminating
the
law.
the
theory
there
would
be
that
the
law
had
a
termination
point
upon
the
making
of
a
finding.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
that
where--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
so--
--but
once...
but
once
you
acknowledge
the
legitimacy
of
these
other
statutes,
all
we're
really
arguing
about
is
an
excessive
delegation
question,
not...
not
at
all
a...
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
morrison.
general
dellinger,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
