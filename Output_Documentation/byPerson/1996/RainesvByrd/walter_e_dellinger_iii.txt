mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
single
most
important
point
i
want
to
make
this
morning
is
a
point
that
goes
both
to
standing
and
the
merits,
and
it
is
this:
the
passage
of
the
line
item
veto
act
does
not
alter
the
authority
or
the
ability
of
congress
to
require
the
executive
branch
to
spend
appropriated
funds.
after
the
act,
as
before,
every
legislative
option
about
whether
an
appropriation
should
be
mandatory
or
discretionary
remains
fully
available
to
a
simple
majority
of
congress.
when
the
time
comes
to
vote
on
an
appropriations
bill,
the
legal
effect
of
each
option,
mandatory,
discretionary,
linked
or
unlinked,
will
be
perfectly
clear.
every
member's
vote
will
be
fully
counted.
the
simple
majority
of
congress
retains
full
authority
to
protect
any
item
of
spending
from
presidential
cancellation.
this
point
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
appellee's
claim
of
standing.
consider
their
best
shot,
i
believe
is
the
example
with
which
they...
they
feature
in
the
opening
of
their
reply
brief,
an
example
where
a
member
votes
for
an
abc
bill
which
might
lead,
they
say,
to
the
post
hoc
creation
of
an
abc
law
or
an
ac
law.
suppose,
they
say,
the
items
a,
b,
and
c
are
aid
to
egypt,
to
jordan,
and
to
israel.
a
member
of
congress
might
well
wish
to
vote
for
the
delicate
balance
embodied
in
the
entire
package,
but
have
objections
to
keeping
any
of
the
items
if
the
others
were
to
be
stricken.
the
act
converts
a
vote,
they
say,
for
abc
in
toto
into
a
vote
for
a
three-item
menu
from
which
the
president
may
select
any
combination
that
he
alone
prefers,
and
the
member
is
injured
at
the
moment
he
must
cast
his
vote.
this
is
simply
a
profound
misunderstanding
of
the
nature
of
the
situation.
when
the
time
comes
for
congress
to
vote
on
the
omnibus
foreign
aid
bill
it
can,
by
simple
majority,
make
any
choice
it
wants
about
mandating
or
linking
those
funds.
congress
can
say
with
respect
to
the
appropriation
for
each
country
that,
quote,
no
funds
under
this
act
may
be
expended
for
payments
to
country
a
unless
funds
are
provided
concurrently
to
the
other
two
countries,
or
congress
can
vote
to
mandate
all
three,
using
the
language
it
actually
sets
out
in
the
bill
for
limited
tax
benefits
by
saying
something
like,
section
1021(a)
of
the
empowerment
control
act
shall
not
apply
to
provisions
i,
j,
and
e
of
this
appropriations
act.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
could,
of
course,
though
we
doubt
that
it
would.
we
think
that
the
act
has
important
functions
as
a
background
default
mode
but
it
is...
would
not
be
at
all
surprising
if
particular
projects
were
put
forth
at
an
appropriation
and
also
with
the
notion
that
section
1021(a)
should
not
apply.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree,
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor.
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--but
in
your
example
congress
passes
the
requirement
that
the
provision
be
exempt
from
this
provision
only
after
it
has
first
passed
an
omnibus
appropriations
act,
but
congress
is
more
likely
to
choose
to
do
that
with
an
appropriation
it
cares
about
in
the
process
of
passing
the
omnibus
appropriations
act,
and
that's
not,
you
know,
unfamiliar.
congress
in
the
very
act
that
they
use
as
an
example
provided
that
the
assistance
for
israel
and
egypt
shall
be
provided
with
the
president's
assurance
that
the
level
does
not
cause
an
adverse
impact
on
the
total
level
of
military
support,
that
the
sum
of
$815
million
available
only
for
egypt
with
the
understanding
that
egypt
will
undertake
significant
economic
reforms,
et
cetera.
that
is
to
say,
congress
is
quite
familiar
with
that
process,
so
that
i
think
if
you
looked
at
this
in
the
context
of
a
real
case
or
controversy
after
the
fact,
you
might
well
have
seen
that
senator
byrd
or
senator
moynihan
had
moved
to
link
the
aid
to
egypt,
israel,
and
jordan,
and
had
that
rejected,
53-47,
and
then
moved
to
make--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
it
was
intended
to
and
it
does
change
the
legislative
dynamic,
but
not
in
a
way
that
creates
a
legal
injury.
senator--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
he
wouldn't,
but
that's
only
because
he
will
have
been
unable
to
convince
a
majority
of
his
colleagues
to
make
that
mandatory.
i
mean,
the
critical
aspect--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
that
is
their
example,
and
i
do
understand
that
the
bill
has
a
large
number
of
items,
but
a
member
who
has
a
very
particular
interest
in
preserving
the
san
diego
shipyard
has
it
within
his
power
to
convince
a
majority
of
his
colleagues
by
simply
adding
the
phrase
that
to
this
item
section
1021(a)
shall
not
apply.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
and
what
it
would
take
is
the
political
will
on
the
part
of
congress
to
maintain
the
commitment
that
the
line
item
veto
act
represents
the
deficit
reduction,
but
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
it
is
a
whether
question,
and
a
when
question.
i'm
sorry,
i
did
it
again.
my--
[laughter]
may
i
take...
once
you
get
that
in
your
mind,
you
know,
you're
lost.
may
i
apologize
to
justice
o'connor
and
justice
ginsburg,
and
to
chief
justice
souter.
justice
ginsburg,
it's
a
particularly
good
question,
too,
so
i'm...
the...
i
hate
to
attribute
it
elsewhere.
that
is
not
what
i
am
suggesting,
because
of
course
there
will
be
standing
at
the
appropriate
time
by
someone
who
is
injured.
i'm
suggesting
that
these
senators
and
members
do
not
have
standing
now
and
never
will
have
standing.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
but
i'll
tell
you
who
would
have
standing.
if
congress
passes
an
appropriation
for
a
hog
for
every
farmer
on
certain
conditions,
and
the
president
cancels
that
item,
a
farmer
who
is
supposed
to
get
his
hog
under
the
appropriation
act
sues
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
says,
i
want
my
hog.
this
conferral
of
authority
on
the
president--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--of
a
line
item
or
items
is
unconstitutional--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
suppose
that
is
his
argument.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there's
not
an
injury
now
because
these
members
of
congress
at
this
point
can
vote
and
persuade
their
colleagues
to
vote
for
any
item
they
wish.
the...
senator
byrd
and
senator
moynihan
and
the
others
allege
that
they
are
presently
uncertain
about
what
the
consequence
of
their
vote
will
be,
but
as
i
noted
at
the
outset
they
have
in
the
hands
of
the
majority
of
their
colleagues
the
key
to
their
own
uncertainty
by--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
is
not
an
injury
sufficient
for
article
iii
purposes.
i
know
that
he
may
be
harmed
at
present,
because
that
uncertainty
he
shares
in
common
with
any
member
of
congress
who
does
not
know
how
certain
the
future
is.
if
you're
voting
on
the
omnibus
crime
control
act,
it
may
be
that
the
death
penalty
provision
or
the
gun
control
provision
is
the
sole
reason
you
would
vote
for
such
a
bill,
and
yet
you
do
not
know
at
the
point
you
have
to
vote
whether
this
court
would
sustain
such
a
provision.
you
in
that
sense
have,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
a
factual
injury
which
may
lead
you
to
seek
an
advisory
opinion.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
we
believe
it
is...
we
concede
and
concur
that
the
prudential
standing
of
objections
have
been
set
to
one
side
by
the
act
of
congress
setting
aside
members,
but
we
believe
that
there
is
an
absence
here
of
an
article
iii
injury
because
it
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
our
separation
of
powers
to
assume
that
a
member
of
the
legislature
has
an
interest
in
the
legislation
for
which
he
voted
after
it
is
enacted
and
when
it
is
being
implemented.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
coleman
is
both
dubious,
at
best,
and
distinguishable.
that
is
to
say,
the
conferral
of
standing
upon
the
legislative
members
of
the
kansas
senate
was
on
the
basis
of
an
allegation
that
their
actual
vote
was
not
properly
counted
in
the
legislative
process
itself.
they
were
seeking
a
mandate
to
compel
a
proper
record
of
legislative
action.
here,
they're...
everything
that
needs
to
be
known
they
can
find
out
before
they
vote,
and
they're
really
complaining
about
the
president's
hypothetical
implementation
of
an
act
in
the
future.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
a
majority
of
the
kansas
legislature,
which
is
already
a
difference,
21
of
the
40
members,
brought
that
action
complaining
that
20
of
them
had
voted
no,
and
that
their
vote
had
been
erroneously
recorded
as
approving
the
child
labor
amendment
when
they
had
in
fact
rejected
it.
now,
there
may
be
other
prudential
reasons
for
a
court
not
to
get
involved
in
intralegislative
battles,
but
as
the
executive
branch
we
would
not
have
a
concern
there,
and
would
recognize
that
that
may
be
an
injury
within
the
executive
branch.
i
do
think
that
the
fact
that
the
case
was
brought
in
state
court,
when
no
one
objected
to
justice
frankfurter's
assertion
for
four
justices
in
dissent
that
no
one
would
dispute
you
could
not
have
brought
this
in
federal
court
at
that
time.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
again,
i
think
that
coleman
is
dubious
and
shows--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
for
that...
i
think
it
is
dubious
to
consider
that
this
is
a
justiciable
controversy.
i
mean,
in
the
wisdom
of
article
iii's
having
this
court--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
there
were...
there
was
sort
of
a
missing
judge
on
one
of
the
issues,
a
nine-justice
court.
they
were
said
to
be
equally
divided
on
one
of
the
issues,
but
four
justices,
including
justice
black,
justice
douglas
and
justice
frankfurter,
joined
a
very
strong
opinion
by
justice
frankfurter
that
made
the
basic
point
that
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
issue
opinions.
you
know,
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
right,
but
the
court
did
resolve
important
constitutional
questions
in
coleman
v.
miller,
in
a
case
that
still
isn't
ripe
to
this
day,
which
shows
the
benefits
of
adhering
to
article
iii.
there
still
haven't
been
a--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
there
well
may
not
be
anyone
who
could
sue
but
that...
on
that
particular
cases.
there
will
certainly
be
people
who
can
challenge
the
validity
of
giving
to
the
president,
delegating
to
the
president
the
cancellation
authority,
because
the
president
will
no
doubt,
or
some
president
will
promptly
cancel
items
where
there
are
domestic
u.s.
citizens--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
absolutely
right,
and
if
there's
nobody,
so
be
it.
this
court
does
not
sit
to
issue
pronouncements
about
matters
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
there
could
be
some
cancellations--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
justice
ginsburg,
there
should
be
some
cancellations
for
which
there
would
be
no
one
who
had
standing,
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
in
the
following
sense.
i
think
that
there
is
not
a
genuine
article
iii
case
or
controversy
at
this
moment.
i
think
what
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--but
in
this
sense.
i
think
what
the
very
able
attorneys
for
the
members
of
congress
have
done,
they've
taken
two
fundamental
jurisdictional
flaws,
lack
of
standing
and
lack
of
ripeness,
and
merged
them
together
in
an
alchemic
process
that
produces
the
illusion
of
a
case
or
controversy.
i
think
if
we
had
had
an
actual
cancellation
of
aid
to
hog
farmers,
clearly
a
hog
farmer
could
sue,
but
we
would
not
at
that
point
believe
that
a
member
of
congress
could
come
into
court
and
say,
this
is
not,
and
the
president
is
not
implementing
this
and
in
a
way
that
i
thought
so.
by
moving--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
so.
we
have
no--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--we
take
no
dispute.
that
is
an
internal
matter
in
the
legislature,
but
i
think
if
you
actually
denied
a
member--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
they
state--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the...
it...
i
think
this
would
be
much
clearer
to
the
court...
i
understand
this
is
a
prudential
point,
but
the
merits
and
indeed,
even
the
lack
of
standing
of
these
member
plaintiffs
would
be
much
clearer
to
the
court
after
the
fact.
you
might
well
have
a
case
come
before
you
where
senator
moynihan
had
voted
to
link
all
three
provisions,
or
where
senator
byrd
had
moved
to
make
the
dellinger
center
a
mandatory
item
exempted
from
1021
on
the
floor.
you
would
have
seen
that
he'd
been
able
to
make
that
motion,
he'd
been
able
to
vote
on
it,
and
his
only
problem
would
have
been
his
inability
to
persuade
a
majority
of
his
colleagues
to
do
so.
the
president's
cancellation
would
come
to
you
informed
by
the
legislative
record
and
all
of
the
determinations
that
the
president
would
make.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
it
does
have
an
article
iii
component
when
there
is
not
yet
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
that
is
to
say,
even
if
a
member
was
going
to
have
standing
after
the
president
cancelled
his
or
her
favorite
project,
article
iii
standing
and
an
injury...
my
project
was
cancelled...
which
we
would
dispute,
they
clearly
would
not
have
standing
now
to
say
that
i'm
worried
that
the
president
may
cancel
my
favorite
project,
and
i'm
worried
anticipatorily
that
i
will
not
be
able
to
convince
a
majority
of
my
colleagues
to
make
an
exemption,
and
you're
saying--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
what--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
to
this
extent
you
have
to
look,
you
know,
to
resolve
the
standing
question,
justice
kennedy,
that
you
have
to
look
at
least
this
far
at
the
merits
of
their
allegation.
it
is
impossible
to
resolve
it
without
looking
at
it
and
say
no,
wait
a
minute.
they
vote
for
any
provision
they
want
to.
they
know
exactly
what
they're
voting
on.
if
it's
made
mandatory,
they
know
that.
if
it's
made
discretionary
by
the
effect
of
the
line
item
veto
act,
they
know
that.
the
president
signs
it.
it
fully
complies
with
the
presentment
clause,
and
as
i
take
them
to
concede
at
page
39
of
their
brief,
that
the
president
signs
the
whole
appropriations
tax
spending
bill
and
the
whole
bill
becomes
law
the
instant
the
president
signs
it.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
would
not
dispute
that
the
dynamic
of
the
legislative
process
has
changed,
but
that
is
true
whatever
the
background
assumption
is.
if
it's
the
empowerment
control--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
not
a
legal
injury.
the
dynamic
has
changed
because
senator
byrd
will
tell
you
he
now
has
to
persuade
a
majority
of
his
colleagues
if
he
wants
to
make
sure
that
a
bill,
a
provision
he
wants
remains
the
law,
and
in
case
you
think
that
i
am
imagining
members
seeking
exemptions
for
their
own
pet
projects
and
having
the
majority
vote
on
it,
if
you
have
occasion,
look
at
page
55a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it's
the
section
of
the
bill,
section
1027,
it
happens
to
deal
with
the
limited
tax
benefit,
but
they
actually
set
out
in
the
bill
the
language
to
be
used
to
exempt
targeted
tax
benefits
from
the
provisions
of
the
act,
and
that
language
works
perfectly
well
for
any
provision.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
souter,
he
does
indeed
know
that
the
bill
for
which
he
votes
is
going
to
be
subject
to
an
up
or
down
determination.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
nor
does
he
know
that
when
he
votes
on
a
lump
sum
appropriations
bill.
he
has
exactly
the
same
uncertainty
about
how
the
president
will
do
that,
and
we
have
had--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--now,
i
think
this
ignores
a
200-year
tradition
in
which
all
three
branches
have
understood
that
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
not
always
practically
true,
though.
i
will
admit
the
difference.
but
if
you
take
a
bill
like
the
very
first
defense
appropriations
act
passed
in
1789,
where
congress
said
the
funds
are
authorized
not
to
exceed
x
amount
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
department
of
war,
when
a
member
votes
for
that,
he
knows
he
is
voting
for
a
bill
where
the
president
can
choose
to
build
ships
or
not
build
ships.
in
this
case,
it
is
true
that
the
bill
as
it
finally
passed
made
the
president's
decision
to
cancel
irrevocable,
and
the
irony
i
think
of
this
litigation
is
that
the
very
steps
that
congress
took
to
make
sure
that
the
delegation
was
not
excessive,
that
is
to
cabin
the
president's
discretion
to
deal
with
what
senator
byrd
has
called
the
sword
of
damocles
problem...
the
president
can
hold
out
over
members
the
possibility
that
he
may
cancel
their
project,
or
that
he
may,
having
cancelled
it,
uncancel
it
if
a
member
will
be
sufficiently
favorable
to
executive
branch
prerogatives...
these
two
provisions
have
the
effect
of
limiting,
cabining
and
guiding
the
president's
discretion
by
saying
you
have
to
make
it
at
the
outset
of
the
appropriations
period--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--within
5
days.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--exactly,
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
question
is,
do
you
have
the
courage
of
your
constitutional
convictions,
and
if
they
do,
they
suffer
no
injury.
that
is,
if
a
member
says,
i
am
voting
for
this
appropriations
bill.
i
believe
that
my...
i
believe
that
the
center
for
the
study
of
the
senate
will
be...
authorization
for
my
university
will
go
forward.
i
believe
that
the
cancellation
will
be
a
nullity,
and
that
when
the
president
of
my
university
back
home
sues
for
the
appropriation
it
will
be
speedily
forthcoming
as
this
court
will
invalidate
the
cancellation.
you
can
vote
on
that
assumption,
or
you
can
vote
on
the
assumption
of
the
presumption--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
would
assume
that...
again,
this
is
a
matter
in
which
the
executive
branch
has
no
particular
interest.
i
would
assume
that
he
could
sue
as
soon
as
the
rule
was
passed.
i
believe
that
powell
v.
mccormack...
that
far--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--again,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
they
have
no
legal
injury
because
nothing
has
happened
to
them--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
has
legal
consequence.
they're
complaint--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--is
merely
with
the
majority
of
their
colleagues,
but
i
have
to
say--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is
a
valuable
decision.
let
me
say
that,
you
know,
my
immediate
executive
branch
clients
would
very
much
like
to
see
this
court
get
to
the
merits
and
hold
that
this
delegation
of
authority
not
to
spend
money
is
constitutional.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
they
are
fully
adequate
to
supply
the
intelligible
principle.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
do
not
think
that
they
are
broader
than
the
delegation
to
the
sentencing
commission
to
seek
fairness
and
do
equity,
but
moreover--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
i
understand...
if
i
could
persuade
eight
justices,
that
would
be
enough,
but--
[laughter]
but
the...
you
have
to
understand
that
the
difference--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
federal
communications
commission,
thank
you,
is
a
very
good
example,
but
here
you're
talking
about
a
matter
that
is
within
the
president's
normal
control.
the
fact
that
the
court
emphasized
in
loving
administering
the
budget
as
administrator-in-chief
is
the
person
to
whom
you're
giving
this...
this
act
respects
the
congressional
power
of
the
purse
in
a
very
profound
way.
the
framers
did
care
that
congress
control
spending,
but
they
cared
by
setting
a
maximum.
they
said
in
article
i,
section
9,
that
no
money
should
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
but
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law,
but
it
does
not
require
express
congressional
approval
to
leave
money
in
the
treasury.
this
is
a
case
where
the
intelligible
principle
of
saving
money
is
itself
so
understandable
in
a
country
that
is
spending
more
money
than
it
is
taking
in,
and
where
the
president
is
directed
through
elaborate
procedures
to
explain
the
basis
for
his
decision,
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
there
is
a
very
real--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
the
president
may
well
gain
guidance
from
the
particular
underlying
statute
that
informs
the
appropriations...
the
national
park
act
may
give
him
a
sense
of
where
there--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
it
would
be
quite
different,
and
you'd
have
a
much
more...
a
much
greater
need
for
a
more
concrete,
intelligible
principle
if
you
were
affecting
private
ordering,
if
you
were
affecting
prior
acts,
if
you
were
regulating--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--even
for
the
future
i
think
the
instruction,
the
intelligible
principle
is
always
in
context,
and
here
all
you're
talking
about
is
not
spending
money.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
to
answer
the
second
question
first,
no.
i
mean,
under
the
court's
severability
standards,
that
unless
it
is
evident
that
the
legislature
would
not
have
acted--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i...
they
have
not
made
out
that
case
at
all,
and
i
think
that
the
targeted
tax
benefit
part
is
quite
minor.
if
you
look
at
it
carefully,
there
are
very
few
things
that
qualify.
tax
benefits
for
three
taxpayers
is
not
a
limited
tax
benefit
if
they're
the
only
ones
in
the
industry,
like
the
automotive
industry,
and
congress
specifically...
and
we
may
never
see
a
limited
tax
benefit
if
you
look
at
how
easy
congress
has
made
it
to
list
the
ones
that
apply
and
to
which
it
does
not
apply.
there
is
always
a
baseline
tax.
this
is
not
a
matter
where
the
president
is
going
out
creating
tax
liability
without
an
underlying
tax
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy
raised
the
question
about
irregularity
in
the
legislative
process
as
being
an
allegation
that
would
give
rise
to
standing.
i
want
to
note
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
are
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
director
of
omb.
if
there
is...
we
don't
believe
there
was
any
defect
in
the
internal
procedures
because
the
members'
votes
were
counted
and
the
bill
was
presented
to
the
president
and
he
complains
about
what
the
president
does
thereafter.
but
if
there
were
an
actual
deprivation
of
the
right
to
vote,
the
appropriate
suit
would
be
against,
i
would
assume,
someone
in
the
legislative
branch.
it
is
not
the
case
that
when
the
president
exercises
his
discretion
to
cancel
in
order
to
carry
out
deficit
reduction
that
the
provision
has
no
legal
force
and
effect.
what
the
statute
actually
says
is
that
the
budget
authority
has
no
legal
force
or
effect.
the
act...
the
provision
continues
to
define
the
amount
of
money
that,
for
gramm-rudman
and
pay-as-you-go
purposes
and
sequestration
purposes,
the
amount
of
allowable
spending
is
reduced.
here
you
have
a
restriction
of
the
president's
delegated
authority
to
cover
one-third
of
the
budget
only
for
a
period
of
8
years,
where
he
may
draw
upon
the
entire
expertise
of
the
executive
branch
in
making
a
conclusion
that
it
is
better
to
allocate
some
money
exclusively
to
deficit
reduction.
we
believe
that
that
broad
congressional
and
executive
consensus
should
be
sustained.
thank
you.
