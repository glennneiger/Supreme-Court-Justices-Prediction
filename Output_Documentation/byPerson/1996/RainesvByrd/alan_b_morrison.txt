mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
line
item
veto
act
of
1996
fundamentally
alters
the
federal
lawmaking
process
by
giving
the
president
the
new
power
of
cancellation.
this
cancellation
applies
to
traditional
spending
items;
to
new
items
of
direct
spending,
such
as
entitlements,
which
includes
the
rights
of
individuals
to
food
stamps,
medicare,
state
and
local
governments
to
contracts...
and
of
those
that
are
increased;
and
to
limited
tax
benefits,
precisely
the
kind
of
private
ordering
that
solicitor
general
dellinger
just
mentioned.
and
while
i'm
on
that
subject,
if
i
may
answer
justice
breyer's
inquiry,
this
was
a
very
important
part
of
the
legislation.
we
have
prepared
a
legislative
summary,
which
was
submitted
in
the
district
court.
it's
part
of
the
joint
appendix.
at
page
82,
there
is
a
description
of
how
important
it
was
in
summary
of
the
testimony
of
a
number
of
witnesses
who
expressed
the
view
that
the
tax
element
was
an
important
balance,
and
that
the
votes
were
very
close
on
the
substitutes.
and
we
believe
it's
quite
evident
in
this
case
that
if
there
had
been
no
tax
benefit
provision
in
the
bill,
there
would
have
been
no
bill.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
do
not
believe
so,
because
that
must
be
in
the
text
of
the
act
itself.
that
is,
the
joint
committee
identifies
them.
they
go
into
the
text
of
the
act.
and
if
they
are
listed
in
the
text
of
the
act,
then
those
are
the
only
limited
tax
benefits.
similarly,
if
the
joint
committee
says
there
are
no
limited
tax
benefits,
then
the
president
may
not
cancel
any.
but
if
the
joint
committee
does
not
state
either
way,
then
the
president
may
use
his
normal
tools
of
interpretation
to
decide
whether
any
of
the
tax
benefits
conferred
come
within
it.
but
i
do
not
believe...
and
i
thought
about
it
long
and
hard
whether
that's
independently
a
constitutional
defect.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
certainly.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
because
he
has
not
been
injured
in
any
ongoing
way.
his
decision
has
been
rejected.
and
if
all
we
were
seeking
here
was
a
decision,
saying
to
the
court
that
a
matter
on
which
i
voted
for
as
a
member
of
congress...
suppose
i
voted
for
a
flag...
against
the
flag
burning
amendment
and
it
passed.
i
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
go
to
court
to
object
to
the
substance.
what
our
clients
are
objecting
to
here
is
that
the
act
fundamentally
changes
the
process
by
which
laws
will
be
made
in
the
future,
and
that
these
members
are
among
the
535
people
in
the
united
states
who
make
the
laws.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
that
depends
on
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
depends
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
"personal
interest"
in
your
hypothetical.
i
believe
that
the
constitution
gives
members
of
congress
the
right
to
vote.
and
that,
to
that
extent,
it
is
as
much
a
personal
interest
here
as
was
adam
clayton's
powell
interest
personal
when
he
was
deprived
a
seat
in
congress.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
because...
it's
not
because
of
standing,
your
honor.
it's
because
it's
textually
committed
to
another
branch.
those
are
two
different
questions.
part
of
what
your
honor
was
suggesting
about
the
federal
officer
has
to
do
with
an
underlying
theme
in
the
solicitor
general's
position,
which
is
separation
of
powers.
that
it's
somehow
inappropriate
for
legislators
to
be
coming
into
court,
both
for
reasons
of
the
court's
usurping
the
business
of
the
political
branches
and,
second,
because
of
a
fear
of
some
floodgates.
we
have
a
different
situation
here
than
in
almost
any
case
that
the
congressional
standing
has
come
up
in
before.
and
that
is
the
situation
where
we
have
an
express
judicial
review
provision
put
in
by
the
congress,
signed
into
law
by
the
president.
so
the
prudential
considerations
are
such
that
where
we
ought
to
be
concerned
about
separation
of
powers,
we
can
say
to
ourselves
that
the
political
branches
have
said
that
this
is
an
appropriate
use
of
the
judicial
forum.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
certainly
is,
your
honor,
and
i
agree.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
are
prudential
separation
of
powers
considerations,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
i'm
suggesting
that
one
of
the
elements
of
the
judicial
review
provision
is
that
it
limits
both
the
possibility
of
unjust
usurpation
and
excess
use
of
the
courts.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
do.
but
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
this
case
is
as
ripe
as
a
case
like
buckley
against
valeo,
in
which
there
was
a
very
comparable
judicial
review
provision
to
the
one
here.
and
the
challenge
was
a
separation
of
powers
challenge
to
the
composition
of
the
federal
election
commission.
the
people
who
were
bringing
that
challenge
were
candidates
or
voters.
although
the
commission
had
done
a
few
things,
it
had
done
nothing
to
which
any
of
them
objected...
rather
like
the
fact
that
the
president
hasn't
cancelled
anything
here.
the
court
said,
we
will
reach
that
constitutional
issue
because
the
congress
has
told
us
we
may
do
it
and
should
do
it.
and
i
think--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--such
as
moore.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
that
is
a
more
difficult
case.
i
would
say
the
answer
is
probably
not.
but
it's
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
case
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
we
have
the
judicial
review
statute.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
significant
consideration
of
separation
of
powers
that
ought
to
caution
the
courts
before
taking
them
up.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i...
i
believe--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
believe
that...
that
the
injure...
that
the
person
may
have
suffered
an
injury.
but
i
do
believe
that
there
are
some
separation
of
powers
elements
in
article
iii
that
there
may
not
be
a
case
or
controversy
in
that...
in
that
regard.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
as
far
as
a
standing
question
is
concerned,
when
this
court
had
before
it
the
goldwater
case,
which
is
the
converse
of
that,
the
court
declined
to
reach
the
merits,
but
no
member
of
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
lack
of
standing
for
senator
goldwater,
although
that
issue
had
been
specifically
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
divided
opinion.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
was,
your
honor.
i
simply
observe
that,
and
your
honor
is
quite
correct,
and
i
don't
want
to
make
too
much
of
it.
but
insofar
as
standing
is
concerned,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
injury
component
of
standing,
i
believe
in
all
of
those
cases,
as
in
this
one,
the
members
have
been
injured.
whether
there
are
other
reasons
why
they
should
not
be
entitled
to
come
to
court
is
a
different
question.
in
this
case,
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
think
you
do.
and
i
think
you
may.
and
i
think
you
have
them
in
the
constitution.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
i
think
it's
particularly
important
that
they
provided
the
right
to
sue
in
the
bill
itself.
this
is
not
a
general
standing
provision,
allowing
members
to
go
to
court
any
time
they
want.
this
is--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--in
my
view,
that
member
has
been
injured
in
a
constitutional
sense,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
have
to
agree
with
me
on
that
proposition
to
find
standing
here.
because
what
we
have
here--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
and...
and
i
think--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that's
right.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
because
it's
after
the
fact.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
continuous,
ongoing
change
in
the
dynamic
of
the
lawmaking
process.
that
members
now
have
to
consider
a
whole
different
range
of
options
and
opinions
and
things
that
they
had...
did
not
have
to
consider
before.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
it
were
the
ordinary
kind
of
case,
where
someone
was
complaining
about
the
result
of
a
law
rather
than
the
result
of
the...
the
impact
on
the
continuing
operation
on
the
constitutional
right
to
vote,
that
only
535
members
have,
we
would
have
a
different
situation.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
this
is
not
a
case
involving
injury
based
on
legislative
doubt.
this
is
a
case
involving
a
situation
in
which
members
of
congress
now
have
a
new
mountain
to
climb.
in
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
they
are
certainly--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--except
insofar
as
they
have
to
deal--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--except
that
he
has
to
deal
with
and
negotiate
with
all
the
remaining
members
of
his
or
her
body.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
the
other
people
may
have
no
constitutional
doubt.
in
terms
of
injury--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
can
also
affect
bills
that
the
president
may
choose,
for
whatever
reason,
not
to
exercise
his
power
of
cancellation
over.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
and...
and
in
addition
to
the
dynamic,
every
time
they
cast
a
vote,
the
meaning
and
effect
of
that
vote
is
changed.
it
is
no
longer
simply
the
vote
that
they
had
in
the
past,
knowing
that
if
they
voted
for
a
bill,
it
would
be
the
law
or
not
the
law,
but
only
in
that
forum.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is...
that
is
correct
if
it's...
in...
only...
but
only
if
in
fact
the
constitutionality
is
determined
on
the
very
first
bill
that
comes
up
there.
because--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--if...
if...
if
a
bill
passes
and
the
president
doesn't
challenge
it,
people
will
have
taken
steps
along
the
way
and
done
different
things
that
may...
that
may
not
show
up.
may
i
give
an
example,
if
i
may?
one
of
the
features
of
this
bill
that
makes
it
so
significant
to
change
the
dynamic
is
that
the
president's
power
of
cancellation
extends
not
simply
to
items
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
everything
in
the
legislative
history
that
can
be
separately
identified
or
specified.
so
that
members
now
must,
in
addition
to
negotiating
over
the
terms
of
the
bill,
they
must
now
go
and
read
the
legislative
history
and
figure
out--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--let
me
be
very
clear
about
the
concept
of
separate
enrollment,
because
i
do
not
believe
the
solicitor
general's
brief
is
as
clear
as
it
might
be
on
this.
there
are
two
concepts
of
separate
enrollment.
one
item,
one
bill
passed
through
both
houses
of
congress
as
separate
items,
and
then
signed
by
the
president.
that
concept
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
the
concept
of
separate
enrollment
as
it
passed
the
senate...
and
this
is
explained
in...
in
our
joint...
in
the
joint
appendix...
was
a
different
concept.
the
bill
would
be
agreed
upon
by
the
committee,
the
conference
committee.
it
would
then
be
sent
back
to
the
enrollment
clerks
in
each
house...
in
the
house.
and
they
would
then
go
through
and
separate
out
each
item
in
both
the
text
and
the
legislative
history.
those
separate
items
would
then
come
forward.
and
senator
byrd
and
others
estimated
there
would
be
something
like
2,000
of
them
in...
in
these...
in
most
of
these
appropriations
bills.
they
would
then
come
back
to
the
floor,
and
they
would
be
voted
on,
en
masse,
not
separately,
as
article
i,
section
7
says.
they
would
then
be
voted
on,
en
masse.
only
at
that
point
would
the
respective
officers
in
the
house
and
senate
have
to
sign
each
of
them.
and
the
president
could
then
sign
and
veto
each.
in
our
view,
that
is
just
as
an
unconstitutional
as
this
bill.
and,
indeed,
mr.
dellinger
testified
before
the
senate
he
believed
that
that
was
unconstitutional
as
well.
because
the
bill
that
has
passed
the
congress
is
not
what
is
being
presented
to
the
president.
it
is
a
violation
of
the
presentment
clause.
so,
if
i
may,
to
answer
your
question
that
way,
a
true
separate
enrollment
is
of
course
constitutional.
but
the
concept
that
passed
the
senate
was
not
true
separate
enrollment,
but
it
was
pass
it
as
a
group
and
then
sign
it
separately.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i'm
sorry?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
know
how
that
could
be
enforced.
but...
and
without
having
thought
about
it
more,
i...
i
think
it
would
probably
be...
what
would
concern
me
was
that
somehow
you're
restricting
the
rights
of
members...
members
to...
to
put
in
the
bills
what...
what
they
choose.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
had
not
thought
of
that,
but
it
certainly
seems
that
it
would...
would
put
a
big
dent
in
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
not
our
injury,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia.
our
injury
is
not
that
we
can't...
don't
know
how
to
vote
because
of
doubt.
it
is
because
the
statute
has
created
a
different
process
in
the
legislation...
legislature
now.
that
members
now
have
a
small
mountain
to
climb
every
time
they
want
to
take
out
one
of
these
provisions.
they've
got
to--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
it
is
constitutionality
plus...
plus
the
fact
that...
that
both
the
constitutional
uncertainty
and
the
fact
that
people
will
of
course
disagree
substantively
about
provisions,
and
the
combination
of
the
two
will
work
together
to
change
the
process.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
[laughter]
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
justice--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that,
of
course,
in
the
isolated
bill
context,
is
different
from
this,
because
we
have
an
identifiable
act,
the
line
item
veto
act,
which
has
already
gone
into
effect
and
law.
in
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
is--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--but
it
hasn't
gone--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it
is
not
a
law,
nor
is
it
a
rule
of
congress.
it
has
no
prospective
effect.
it
is
simply
part
of
the
debate
about
the
merits
of
that
particular
law.
we
are
talking
about
an
extrinsic
circumstance,
the
passage
of
a
statute,
the
line
item
veto
act,
which
casts
a
pallor
over
the...
the
statute
that
come
before
the
congress
in
their
appropriations
capacity
and
causes
members
to
act
differently
from
the
way
they
did--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
for
instance,
now,
the
supplemental
appropriations
bills
are
being
considered
by
congress.
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
cancellation
with
respect
to
them.
but
the
pallor
of
the
act
is
hanging
over
them
as
they...
members
have
to
decide
what
to
put
in,
what
to
take
out,
how
to
proceed
with
this
bill,
whether
or
not
there
is
ever
going--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--if
this
were
a
case
in
which
the
president
of
the
united
states
said,
i
don't
know
why
you
gave
me
this
power;
i'm
not
going
to
use
it,
we
would
be
in
a
different
situation
with
respect
to
prudential
aspects
of
rightness.
the
president
made
clear
when
he
sent
his
witnesses
to
testify
that
he
wanted
this
bill.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i...
i
do
believe
that
the...
that
the
concern
we
have
is
over
the
threat
of...
of
the
exercise
of
the
veto,
not
simply
the...
the
actuality
of
the
veto.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it...
it
certainly
does.
but,
in
addition,
the
defendants
we
have
here...
defendant
raines,
is
of
course
the
president's
chief
advisor
on
the...
on
budgetary
matters,
and
defendant
rubin
is...
is
the
tax
matters.
and
that
surely
they
will
participate
with
the
president
in...
in
the...
in
the
process
by
which
decisions
are
made
or
threatened
to
be
made
on...
on
the
line
item
veto.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
terms
of--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--in
terms
of
constitutional
injury,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
but
there
are
other
elements
of
article
iii
case
or
controversy,
such...
the
prudential
elements--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--they
might
be
able
to,
your
honor.
the...
the
possibility
exists.
surely,
adam
clayton
powell's
exclusion
from
the
house
of
representatives
was
not
simply
about
money.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
believe
that...
the
powell
case
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
house
of
representatives
had
continued
to
pay
him
his
salary
during
the
time
that
they
excluded
him.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
may
be...
it
may
have
some...
some
bearing
on
it.
but
i...
the
solicitor
general
conceded
earlier
that
the...
that
if
members
from
iowa
only
had
a
half
a
vote
on
the...
on
the
farm
prices,
that
that...
that
they
would
have
injury.
i...
we
suggested
in
our...
our
reply
brief--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well,
of
course,
the
house
cannot
change
the
constitution.
that
was
clear
from
the
beginning.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
gave
another
hypothetical
in
which
there
is
a
statute
passed
on
a
conflict
of
interest
theory,
under
which
members
of
congress
are
forbidden
from
voting
on
projects
of
more
than
$50
million
if
it's
in
their
district.
and
a
member
wants
to
go
to
court
and
says,
i
have
been
injured
because
i
can
no
longer
vote
on--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--every
member
has
a
right
to
vote
on...
on
pending
bills.
it's
in
the
constitution.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
in
terms
of
injury,
i
think
that
they
are...
that
they
are
injured.
and
that
may
make
a
difference
in
terms
of...
of
how
we...
we...
we
feel
about
it
and
whether
there
ought
to
be
prudential
reasons
why
we
ought
not
to
allow
members
of
congress
to
go
to
court
principally
when
they're
complaining
about
the...
the
fact
that
they
were
outvoted
on...
on
a
matter
in
their
own
house.
but
here
we
have--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--he
might
be
disqualified
for
other
reasons.
but--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is
true.
i
was
thinking
of...
of
the
equitable
situation
of
clean
hands,
that
somebody
might
not
allow
you
to
come
to
court--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--well...
well,
i
agree
with...
i
agree
with
that.
but
we
don't
have
to
face
that
issue
here.
and,
of
course,
it's
hard
to
imagine
that
this
case
would
come
out
differently
if
instead
of
the
five
members
that
we
had
here,
that
we
had
joined
us
a
person
who
was
newly
elected
to
the
congress
in
november
of
1996,
who
never
had
an
opportunity
to
vote
on
it.
does
anything
in
article
iii
suggest
that
the
result
ought
to
be
different?
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
it's
not.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
if
the...
if
the...
you
used...
your
honor
used
the
word
"impoundment"
in
the
first
statement,
and
i
wanted
to
be
clear
about
the
meaning
of
that
term.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
if...
if
your
honor...
i
don't
mean
the
word
itself,
but
if
in
that
context
the
concept
is
the
concept
which
we
have
here,
which
is
a
permanent
repeal
of
the
law,
such
that
the
president
cannot
change
his
mind
again,
nor
can
his
successors,
nor
can
changed
circumstances
revive
the
law,
that
the
only
thing
that
can...
can
do
it
is
a
new
law,
in
my
view,
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
here,
and
it
is
a
repeal.
it
is
the
power
to
extinguish
the
law
and
not
to
execute
the
law.
now,
in
the
second
situation,
it
was
a
little
harder
for
me
to
understand
what
the
rejection
was.
if
it
is
the
same
kind
of
provision,
the
same
kind
of
permanent
change,
off
or
on,
it
is
the
same
kind
of
lawmaking,
not
law
executed
that
we
have
here--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--in
the
line
item
veto.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
they
surely
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
ask
the
irs--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--as
part
of
its
interstitial
lawmaking
authority.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
then
it
doesn't...
if--
[laughter]
if
it
leaves
the
statute
intact,
unlike
this
one,
where
for
all
practical
purposes,
these
provisions
are
gone
upon
cancellation,
if
it
leaves
the
statute
intact,
that's
one
thing.
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
permanent
change
in
the
law,
as
if
the
pages
were
being
cut
out
of
the
united
states
code.
the
statute
says
that
these
provisions
shall
have
no
further
legal
force
and
effect.
the
words
"repeal"
and
"veto"
were
repeatedly
used
in
the
legislative
history.
the
congress
sought
to
enact
a
line
item
veto,
and
that
is
what
they
did
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
virtually
every
one
of
those
cases...
i
believe
every
one
that
we
have
been
able
to
discover
a
point
or
two...
the
president
could
change
his
mind
again.
if
the
situation
changed,
the
words
used
were
"suspension"
rather
than
"cancellation".
the
notion
of
administering
the
law
rather
than
permanently
changing
the
law.
and
we
believe
that
every
one
of
those
cases,
including
the
lump
sum--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
it
was
based
upon
a
narrow
set
of
circumstances.
that
statute,
by
the
way,
was
enacted
in
1933,
and
it
continues
in
effect
today.
i
find
that
relative
little
precedent
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
thing
we
have
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
it's
not
strictly
the
5
days,
justice
stevens.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
if
that
is
all
that
it
said...
and
that
it
was
permanently
terminated--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
he
could
not
revive
it
again--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that,
to
us,
is...
is
lawmaking
rather
than
law
executing.
but
we
can
envision
a--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it's
not
worse
or
better,
your
honor.
it's--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--it's
the...
that
is
not
the
test,
i
believe.
i
believe
the
test
is
whether,
under
the
constitution,
he
is
engaging
in
article
ii
activities,
carrying
out
the
laws,
or
whether
he
is
engaging
in
article
i
activities,
making
the
law.
and
by
permanently
ending
the
law,
he
has
shifted
the
line
from
article
ii
to
article
i.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is
possible
that
he
is
no
longer...
that
if
he's
permanently
terminating...
there
are
circumstances
in
which,
if...
even
though
it
becomes
legally
reversible,
that
it
might
be
considered,
at
least
on
an
individual
basis,
carrying
out
the
law.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
there
have
been
some
laws
in
which
the...
the
president's
power,
as
a
practical
matter,
at
a...
at
a
given
time,
and
he's
told
he
has
to
do
something
and
he...
and
he
carries
out
the
law
in
that
particular
fashion.
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
there
is
no
law
that
i
can
think
of
in
which
a
president
could
not
be
given
the
authority
to
say
that,
at
this
point,
that...
that
the
law
may
be...
may
be
terminated
because
he
would
be
ending
the
execution
of
the
law.
if
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is...
it
is...
it
is
legislating
in
contingency,
as...
as
the
court
has
referred
to
it
in
several
cases--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--in
which
the...
the
termination
process
is
part
of
the
law
itself.
here
the...
the
president
has
the
unfettered
power
to
decide
whether
to
cancel
anything
or
not.
and
if
so,
how
much.
he
is
no
mandated
to
save
a
single
nickel
under
this
program
if
he
chooses
not
to
do
so.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
don't
believe
so
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
my
brief.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
