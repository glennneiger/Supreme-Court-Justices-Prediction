justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
understand
it
to
be
your
position
that
the...
circular
though
the...
the
definition
may
be,
it
is
helpful
to
you
in
the
sense
that
it
is
as
consistent
with
the
reading,
who
was
employed
by
an
employer,
as
with
the
reading,
who
is
employed
by
an
employer.
so...
so
you're
still
in
the
game,
even
though
the
word
"employed"
is
the
modifier.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the
person
who's
filling
out
the
form,
at
the
time
he
fills
out
the
form
is
what
the
statute
is
talking
about.
and
at
the
time
he
fills
out
the
form,
he's
not
an
employee;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
you've
just
admitted
that.
i
mean,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
attempt
to
help
you
out,
you
said,
well,
yeah,
that's
right;
i'd
accept
that
argument.
[laughter]
you're...
you're
not
going
to...
you're
not
going
to
kick
him
now,
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
as...
as
a
practical
matter,
it
seems
to
me
the...
the
situation,
because
it
is
not
what's
going
to
happen
except
among
very,
very
stupid
employers,
because
the...
the
retaliatory
letter
is...
is
not
going
to
say,
don't
hire
this
guy
because
he
filed
a
complaint.
the
letter
is
going
to
say,
don't
hire
him
because
he
does
lousy
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
the
prospective
employer
who
relies
upon
that
is...
is
not
drawing
any
distinction
among
employees,
that...
or
among
prospective
employees...
that
is
not
a
legitimate
distinction.
so
there's
not
going
to
be
any
cause
of
action
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
i
thought
your
argument...
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
person
who
is
subject
to
this
discrimination
will
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute
against
the
prospective
employer
who
relies
upon
the
retaliatory
letter.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
unless
the
retaliatory
letter
is
expressly
based
upon
filing
the
eeoc
complaint,
that
won't
be
true.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
but
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yeah,
that's
a
tough,
uphill
fight.
but
that's
not
going
to
be
the
characteristic
case--
