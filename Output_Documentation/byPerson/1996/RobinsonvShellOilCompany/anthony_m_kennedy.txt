i'm
not
sure...
i'm
not
sure,
in
the
context
of
a
pension
or
a
bonus,
that
there
is
not
a
sufficient
ongoing
relation,
so
that
the
discrimination
that
you
are
hypothesizing
would
be
against
an
employee,
even
though
the
employee
has
been
terminated.
i
think
there
still
are
certain
subsisting
relations
between
the...
the
individual
and
the
employer,
one
of
which
is
entitlements
to
pension,
which
would
mean
that
he's
an
employee
for
that
purpose.
justice

i...
i
was...
i
was
just
directing
my...
my
comments
to
the
pension
and
bonus
example.
but
i...
i
agree
with
your
next
point
that
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
in
my
earlier...
i
thought
in
our
earlier
colloquy
that
we
just
had
that
you
agreed
that
in
the
pension
and
bonus
example--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
terminated
individual
would
have
a
sufficient
nexus--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
the
purpose
of
pension,
to
be
an
employee,
even
under
the
respondent's
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
then,
i
don't
think
we
should
talk
about
employers
who
are
going
to
threaten
former
employees
with
cutting
off
their
pensions.
because
i
thought
we
just
agreed
that
that
wasn't...
wasn't
a
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
it...
but
it
is
certainly
within
the
purview
of
a
logical
construction
of
his
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
isn't...
isn't
the
answer
going
to
be
what
you've
just
said...
that
if
he
doesn't,
under
your
view
of
the
case,
it's
going
to
be
retaliation,
too?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
must...
he
must...
he
must
give
a
reference?
