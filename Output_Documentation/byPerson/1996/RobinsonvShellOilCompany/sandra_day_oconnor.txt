justice

what
other
remedies
are
available
to
someone
who,
after
he's...
he's
been
terminated,
thinks
that
a
reference
was
erroneously
made
and
given
by
the
former
employer?
is
there
any
other
action
at
law
that
would
be
open
for
redress?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that...
that
complaint
was
made
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
the
plaintiff
lost?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
definition
in
the
applicable
section
here
of
the
word
"employee"?
is
that
how
we
should
proceed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
definition
says
the
term
"employee"
means
an
individual
employed
by
an
employer.
and
that
is
ambiguous
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
could
include
former
employees,
a
person
employed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
"employed"?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
title
vii
authorizes
courts
to
order
reinstatement
or
hiring
of
employees.
now,
that
has
to
include
former
employees.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
word
"employed
by"
can
mean
past
tense
or
present,
i
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
know.
this
court
gets
pretty
picky
sometimes
about
what
language--
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
since...
since
the
language
relied
on
is
the
same...
you
refer
to
discrimination...
is
that
not
the
law
of
the
case
now,
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--binding?
