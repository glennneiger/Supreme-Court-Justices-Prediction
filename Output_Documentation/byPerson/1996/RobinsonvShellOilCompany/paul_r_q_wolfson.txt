mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
court
of
appeals
reading
of
section
704(a),
any
employee
who
was
discharged
and
who
went
to
the
eeoc
with
a
complaint
of
discrimination
would
lack
protection
against
his
former
employer
for...
for...
against
retaliation
by
his
former
employer.
i
want
to
focus
for
a
minute
on
why
that
seems
just
to
be
implausible
that
congress
would
have
carved
out
such
a
large
category
of
employees
from
the
reach
of
section
704,
especially
since
discharged
employees
are
probably
among
the...
the
category
of
employees
that
are
really--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i...
i
mean,
i...
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i...
i
think
that's...
that
is
quite
a
possible
reach
within
section
704.
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
focus
is
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--congress...
congress
made
section
704
very...
a
very
clear
and
strong
protection
against
retaliation.
and
i
can't
say
that
it
focussed
specifically
on
the
issue
of
references,
but
it
did
know
that
it
was
very
necessary
for
employees
to
be
able
to
approach
the
eeoc
without
fear
of
adverse
economic
consequences
from
their
employer
for
doing
so.
because
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i...
i...
i'm
aware
of
that
hypothetical.
i
have
to...
first
of
all,
i
have
to
say
that
that
hypothetical
is
not
within
the
eeoc's
experience,
that
that...
that
that
happens.
secondly,
i
think
that
that
is
really
a
very
remote
situation,
and
it
has
to
be
contrasted
with
the
very
realistic
situation,
where
somebody
goes
to
the
eeoc
and,
very
quickly
after
that,
suffers
retaliation.
to
focus
on--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i...
i...
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i...
i
acknowledge,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
could
plausibly
come
within
the...
within
the
reach
of
the
statute,
under
section
704.
but,
i
have
to
say,
i
think
that
is
a
remote
danger.
i
want
to
focus
on
a
point
that
justice
kennedy--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
two...
two
points.
i
mean,
first
of
all--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--not
necessarily.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
it...
it
has
to
be
an
employer,
first
of
all,
who
is...
through
a
section
704--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right,
present
employer
and...
and
former
employer.
and...
but
it's
not...
but
it
isn't
just
references
that...
that
is
at
issue.
i
mean,
justice
kennedy
had
a
colloquy...
a
colloquy
earlier
about
the...
the...
the
problem
of
pension
benefits.
contesting
an
unemployment
claim
is
a
situation
that
you
would...
might
see.
and
the
court,
in
the
sixties,
had
a
case
called
nash
against
florida
unemployment
commission,
where
it
said
that,
under
the
nlra,
that
contesting
an
unemployment
claim
could
be
prohibited
retaliation
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
that,
i
think,
is
a...
a
situation
that
one
might
very
well
expect
to
see.
somebody
quits
or
is
fired,
believes
that
he
was
discharged,
went
to
the
eeoc,
filed
an
unemployment
claim,
and,
immediately
thereafter,
the
employer
decides,
well,
this
one
we'll
contest,
even
though
most
unemployment
claims
for
compensation
we
let
go
because
it
isn't
worth
it,
because
we're
just...
we're
mad
at
the
employee
for
filing
a
claim
of
discrimination.
and
references
are
also,
i
think,
a
situation
where
an
employee
might
very
well
find
that
he
receives
an
adverse
reference
or
he
receives
no
reference
in
all...
at
all...
an
employee...
an
employer
might
normally
have
a
practice
of
saying,
well,
we...
we
say
reasonably
nice
things
about
our
employees
once
they've
gone,
but...
but
did
he...
because
this
one
has
filed
a
discrimination
charge,
this
one,
if
we
get
any
requests
for
a
reference,
we're
just
going
to
pitch
the
request
in
the
bin
and
not
say
anything
at...
at
all.
that
could
be--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
mean,
first
of
all,
the...
the
fact
is
that
employers
still
do
give
references.
the
second--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
it's
only...
it's
only--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it's
only
retaliation
if
he
treats
people
differently.
i
mean,
the
section
704
is...
is
discrimination
against
an
employee
because
he
has
filed
a
charge
with
the
eeoc.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
and
it
is
certainly
the
employee's
burden
to
show
that
there
was...
there
was
a
different
approach
taken
in
his
case
and
that
it
was
caused
by--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
it
doesn't
say...
the
statute
doesn't
say
specifically...
704,
unlike
703,
doesn't
say
discrimination
in
the
terms,
conditions
or
privileges
of
employment.
it
just
says
discrimination.
but
i
would...
but
even
if...
even
if
that's
not
the
case,
i
certainly
would
think
that
failing
to
give
a
reference
or
giving
an
adverse
reference...
if...
if
a
reference
is
under
the
normal
course
of
what
an
employer
does
for
his
employees
once
the
employees
leave
the...
leave
the
company...
if
that...
if
an
employer
decides,
for
one
employee,
because
he's
filed
an
eeo
charge,
i'm
going
to
treat
him
differently--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it...
it's
only
discrimination
if
it...
if
it
is
effected
by
the
retaliation.
that
is
to
say,
if
they
say--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
could
be
the...
the
allegation
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
that
the...
the...
and
it's...
the
complaint
is
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix...
the
allegation
in
this
case
is
that
the
reference
was
false,
in
fact,
and
that
it
was
motivated
by...
by
retaliation.
i
want
to
talk
about
the
word
"employee"--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
certainly,
if...
if...
if
referring
to
the
fact
that
that...
that
he's
filed
an
eeoc
charge.
one
thing--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
not
to
treat
any
employee
differently--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--on
the...
on...
not
to
affect
a
reference
because
the
employee
filed
an
eeoc
charge.
one
of
the
things,
though,
is
that
this...
this
is
something
that
it
doesn't
really
turn
on
just
former...
it
doesn't
turn
on
former
and
current
employees.
that
is,
the
lower
court
says...
it
pointed
out
that
giving
someone
an
adverse
reference
as
retaliation
for
filing
an
eeo
charge
is
some...
something
that
a
current
employee
could
bring
also.
so
it
doesn't...
whatever
problems
there
may
be
with
what
is
retaliation,
and
is
giving
an
adverse
reference,
you
know,
quote,
you
know,
discrimination,
or
is
it
in...
as
retaliation?
it...
it
doesn't...
it's
not
directly
addressed
to
the
analytical
question
in
this
case.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reach
any
of
the...
the
specific,
difficult
issue...
the
difficult
issues
that
might
arise
on
any
specific
factual
circumstances
about,
you
know,
would
a
bad
reference
be
a
retaliation
in
a
particular
case?
turning
to
the
question
of
employee,
our
position
is
that
employee
is...
is
susceptible
of...
of
two
meanings,
and
one...
and
certainly
including
former
employee.
and
ordinary
usage
or
common
usage
of
the
word
bears
that
out.
one
could
say
that
he
gives
his
employees
good
references
and...
in
that...
in
that
situation,
the
speaker
would
certainly
be--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
nobody
suggests
that
that's
not
covered
by
title
vii.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
at
least--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i...
i...
i
think
it's...
the
result
you
point
is...
is...
and
this
was
pointed
out,
i
believe,
in
the...
in
the
dissenting
opinion
below...
that
that's
one
of
the
anomalies
of
that
construction,
which
is
it
encourages--
