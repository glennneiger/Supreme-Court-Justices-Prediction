mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question:
does
the
provision
of
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
that
prohibits
retaliation
against,
quote,
employees,
unquote,
for
filing
charges
of
discrimination
or
otherwise
availing
themselves
of
their
rights
under
title
vii...
namely
section
704(a)...
does
that
section
cover
former
employees,
employees
such
as
petitioner,
charles
robinson,
who
were
discharged
prior
to
the
alleged
retaliation?
in
this
case,
after
charles
robinson
was
terminated
by
shell
oil,
he
filed
a
charge
of
discrimination
against
shell
under
title
vii,
and
subsequently,
shell
gave
him
a
negative
job
reference.
he
then
brought
the
present
action,
alleging
that
that
negative
reference
was
made
in
retaliation
for
his
earlier
charge
of
discrimination.
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
charles
robinson
was
not
even
entitled
to
have
the
court
determine
whether
that
reference
was
retaliatory,
because
he
was
not
employed
by
shell
at
the
time
of
the
reference.
if
shell
had
given
him
that
reference
the
day
before
he
was
terminated,
everyone
agrees,
he
would
have
had
that
right
to
a
judicial
determination.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
well,
that
is
not,
in
fact,
what
actually
happens.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
there
are,
in
fact,
disincentives
to
frivolous
charges
built
into
title
vii,
which
hopefully
would
take
care
of
that
problem.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
a
principal
brings
a
frivolous
lawsuit
under
title
vii
may
be
hit
with
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
there...
there
are...
no,
the
eeoc
can't
apply
any
disincentives
like
that.
that's
true.
but
we
believe
that
the
language--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--there
are
possible
actions
under
state
law.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
but
it
is
well
established
that
title
vii
is
intended
to
give
parallel
remedies
to
any
other
remedies
that
may
be
available.
we
believe
that
the
language
of
title
vii,
and
the
purpose
of
section
704(a),
indicate
that
congress
intended
former
employer...
employees...
to
be
covered
by
the
retaliatory
section.
section
704(a)
provides
that
it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
any
of
his
employees
or
applicants
for
employment
because
he
has
opposed
the
charge
or
because
he
has
opposed
an
unlawful
practice
or
because
he
has
made
a
charge
or
participated
in
an
eeoc
proceeding
as
a
possible
witness.
i
emphasize
that
section
704(a)
protects
an
employee
who
has
made
a
charge,
because
the
substantive
provision
of
title
vii,
section
703(a),
cited
in
full
and
verbatim
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
14,
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
discharge
any
individual
because
of
his
race,
and
so
on.
an
individual--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
right.
that's
right.
now,
an
employee
who
is
discharged
will
necessarily
file
his
charge
of
discrimination
after
he
ceases
working
for
that
employer.
so
when
congress
wrote
section
704(a)--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--yes.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
that's
right.
but
he
would
remain
an
employee,
and
if
he
were
retaliated
against
because
of
that
charge,
he
would
ordinarily
still
be
an
employee
and
clearly
be
covered
by
the
act.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
when
congress
wrote
this
statute,
it
contemplated
that
people
would
file
charges
alleging
that
they
were
discriminatorily
discharged--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--exactly.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
exact--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--exactly.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
he
would
be
covered
by
7...
703(a).
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
if
he's
no
longer
an
employee
at
the
time
of
the
retaliation,
is
he
covered
be
the
statute?
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
of
course,
if
he's--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--of
course,
that--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--that's
right.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
that's
right.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
congress
knew
that
people
would
be
subject
to
retaliation
under
704(a)
when
they
were
no
longer
employees,
because
there
would
be
people
who
file
charges
alleging
that
they
were
discharged
because
of
race
and
so
on,
and
those
people
would
necessarily
be
no
longer
employees
at
the
time
they
might
be
retaliated
against.
so
congress
must
have
contemplated
that
people
who
would
be
firing...
fired,
would
be
filing
charges
and
then
might
be
retaliated
against
when
they
were
no
longer
employees.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
un...
unfortunately,
that
definition
has...
this
court
has
said
that
definition
doesn't
help
us
much--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--well,
this
court--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--that
is
precisely
what
we're
saying.
because,
as
the
court
has
said
in
darden,
that
definition
is
a
circular
definition,
which
doesn't
help
much
in
deciding
who
is
an
employee.
and
as--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--that's
right.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
that--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--that's
right.
but
as...
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
the
earlier
argument,
a
word
in
a
statute
may
have
different
meanings
in
different...
different
parts
of
the
statute,
and
one
must
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
decide
what
that
particular
meaning
is
in
a
given
place
in
the
statute.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
that's
right.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
and...
and
in
order
to
decide
which
of
the
multiple
meanings
the
word
"employee"
has
in
this
statute,
one
must
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
obviously,
is
to
protect
those
people
who
get
discharged
and
then
file
charges
of
discrimination,
and
may
be
subject
to
retaliation.
and
congress
clearly
contemplated
that
those
people
would
making
charges,
would
be
subject
to
retaliation,
and
wrote
the
retaliation
provision,
using
the
simple--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--that's
right.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
no
question
about
it;
this
court
has
said
so.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
yes,
one
does
need
this
act.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
yes,
one
does
need
this
act.
in
arizona
governing
committee,
which
was
cited
in
hishon,
which
we
cite
in
our
case,
this
court
said
that
cutting
off
pension
benefits
or
discriminating
with
regard
to
pension
benefits
on
the
basis
of
sex
was
a
violation
of
the
substantive
provision
of
title
vii.
the
reason
one
needs
this
act
is
because,
if
an
employer
chose
to
cut
off
pension
benefits
as
a
retaliatory
measure,
and
then
were...
was...
was
charged
under
the
substantive
provision
of
title
vii...
the
claim
would
be
you
cut
off
my
pension
benefits
because
i'm
black...
the
employer
then...
if
this
court
upholds
the
fourth
circuit...
could
come
in
and
use
the
fact
that
it
was
motivated
by
retaliation
as
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
charge
that
it
was
motivated
by
sex
or
race.
if
this
court
upholds
the
fourth
circuit,
an
employer
will
have
carte
blanche
to
retaliate
against
discharged
employees.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
that's
right.
that
would
take
care
of...
of
that
one
particular
class.
but
there's
a
broader
class
that
would
not
be
covered
if
this
court
upheld
the
fourth
circuit.
and
that
is
all
those
people
who
have
no
remaining
relationship
with
that
employer.
and
if
the
court
upholds
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--yes.
but
consider...
consider
what
shell
oil
or
any
employer
could
do
if
this
court
upholds
the
fourth
circuit.
the
day
after
this
court
hands
down
its
decision,
shell
oil
could
announce
a
policy
that
any
terminated
employee
who
then
later
files
a
charge
of
discrimination
against
the
company
will
be
subject
to
retaliation.
we
will
retaliate
against
you.
we
will
cut
off
your
pension,
if
you
have
one.
we
will
cut
off
your
health
benefits,
if
you
have--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--and
it
would
not
violate--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--maybe
not.
maybe
not.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
that's
right.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
that
is
absolutely
right.
but
there
is...
that
person--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--yes,
there
is.
of
course,
erisa
would
protect
him.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
but
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action
against
the
employer
who
announced
a
policy
of
simply,
we
will
not
give
you
any
reference--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--and
we
will
not
even
acknowledge
you
worked
for
us.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
yes.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
yes.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
right.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
but--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--well,
he
could
threaten
not
to
give
any
reference--
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
--no,
i...
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
i...
i'll...
i'll
leave
that
for
respondent
to
answer.
mr.
allen
m.
lenchek
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions,
we
have
nothing
further.
