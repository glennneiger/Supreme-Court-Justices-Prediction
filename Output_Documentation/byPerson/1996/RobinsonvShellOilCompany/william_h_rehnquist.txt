argument
next
in
no.
95-1376,
charles
t.
robinson,
sr.,
v.
shell
oil
company.
mr.
lenchek.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
right,
it's...
it's
a
rather
sure
way
to
make...
make
sure
you
don't
get
a
bad
reference;
you
just
file
a
complaint
with
the
eeoc
a
couple
of
days
after...
or
a
couple
of
days
before
you're
fired,
even
though
the
firing
is
completely
justified.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
it
may
not
be
what
in
fact
happened
in
your
case,
but
it
certainly
might
happen
in
a
number
of
other
cases
if
we
sustain
your
position.
or
even
if
you're
not
going
to
be
fired,
even
if
you
just
intend
to
quit,
it
would
be
very
wise,
before
you
quit,
to
file
an
eeoc
complaint.
because
then,
if...
if
the
employer
gives
you
a
bad
reference
in...
in
your
later
job,
he
takes
the
risk
of
being
sued
for
that,
on
the
basis
of
retaliation.
he's
buying
a
lawsuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about,
are
there
any
disincentives
to
filing
a
frivolous
complaint
with
the
eeoc?
any
similar
disincentives?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he'll
file
his
charge
if...
if
he
claims
the
discharge
is
discriminatory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
could...
the
employee
could
remain
employed
and
file
a
complaint
that
a
failure
to
promote
was
discriminatory,
couldn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
--but
it
would
violate
other
laws,
though?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
if
a
person
has
a
vested
pension
and
he's
dismissed
by
an
employer--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there
is
no
law
that
protects
his
enjoyment
of
that
pension?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
i
said...
and
there...
there's
no
law
that
protects
his--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
very
well,
mr.
lenchek.
[laughter]
you'll
let
justice
stevens
and
justice
kennedy
fight
that
out
between
themselves
is
what
you
mean?
mr.
wolfson.
we'll
hear
from
you
mr.
wolfson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
are
talking
about
what
congress
might
have
intended,
do
you
think
congress
really
intended
that
an
action
could
be
brought
against
an
employer
who
makes
a
reference
for
a
person
after...
after
he's
been
discharged?
do
you
think
that
was
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
talked
about
retaliation
against
an
employee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do...
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean...
but
you're
talking
about
what
did
congress
intend.
do
you
think
that
was
what
congress
had
in
mind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
if,
in
this
case,
the...
the
thing...
the
request
for
references
came
10
years--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but...
we're...
we're
going
to...
we're
going
to
have
to
cover
them
both,
i
gather--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--either
to
not
cover
them
both
or
cover
them
both.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that
was
a
question,
mr.
lenchek.
your
time
has
expired.
not
mr.
lenchek...
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
butler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
of
course,
there,
in...
in
the
previous
case,
the
test
was
whether
a
small
employer
is
covered.
and
that's
probably
a
narrower
definition
of
"employee"
than
someone
who
is
entitled
to
sue
under...
under
the
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
butler,
does
the
act
itself,
does
it
use
the
word
"retaliate"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
are
we
talking
about
retaliation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
employer
treats
everybody
alike
who
has
made
a
charge,
he
retaliates
against
them
all?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is...
it's
a...
it's
a
short...
"retaliate"
is
a
shorthand
form
for
the
statutory
language?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
butler.
mr.
lenchek,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
the
case...
the
case
is
submitted.
