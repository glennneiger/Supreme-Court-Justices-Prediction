mr.
butler,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
clarence
thomas
how
often
do
you
give
references
in
discharge
cases?
justice
clarence
thomas
in
discharge
cases?
justice
clarence
thomas
yeah.
justice
clarence
thomas
and
your
solution
for
your
case
is...
is
a
solution
that
will
also
preclude
a
claim
in
a
case
in
which
someone
says...
the
employer
says,
look,
you
file
a
charge
against
me,
and
i
will
see
to
it
that
you
will
never
work
in
this
business
again?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
it's
not...
it's...
well,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
it
is
not
just
the
frivolous
case,
the
frivolous
charge
in
your
case,
the
reference,
but
it
is
also
an
instance
in
which
an
employer
says
you
will
absolutely
never
work
in
this
business
again?
it
precludes
that?
justice
clarence
thomas
okay.
justice
clarence
thomas
and
you
could
solve
your
problem
by
not
giving
references
in
discharge
cases?
