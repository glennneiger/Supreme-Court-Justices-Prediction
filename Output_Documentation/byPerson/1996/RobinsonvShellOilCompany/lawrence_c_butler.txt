mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
involving
statutory
interpretation.
any
case
involving
the
proper
interpretation
of
a
statute
must
begin
by
examining
the
statutory
language.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
no,
i
don't.
nor
do
i
think
that
the
definition
of
employee
within
title
vii
is
a
total
tautology.
it
does
serve
a
purpose:
to
distinguish
between
individuals
and
employees.
i
think
that
that
distinction
between
the
two
is
very
apparent
when
you
look
at
section
703.
if
you
look
at
section
703(a),
which
is
at
page
14
of
my
brief,
you
can
see
that
"employee",
or
"employment",
is
a
status
that
is
obtained
by
an
individual.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
yes,
but
i...
i
think
you
get
back
to
what
justice
scalia
pointed
out:
if
there
is
an
event,
a
discriminatory
event
that
occurs,
then
you
look
at
the
event
and
the
status
of
the
individual
at
the
time
the
event
occurred.
and
certainly,
if
an
employer
fires
someone--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--that's
true.
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
yeah,
but
i
think
you
do
have
to
look
at
the
distinction
between
alleging
discrimination
under
703
and
retaliation
under
704,
because
they
are
not
coextensive.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
no.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i...
i
do
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i
would
hope
not,
justice
kennedy.
but
i
do
not
agree
that
a
person
can
be
an
employee
for
the
purposes
of
some
benefits
and
not
others.
i
think
that
that
is
a
line
drawing
that
is
not
justified
by
the
statute.
the
statute
talks
in
terms
of
employment,
and
i
think
that
is
a
bright
line.
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--well,
i
would
disagree,
only
to
state,
justice
ginsburg,
that,
at
the
time
the
charge
is
filed,
the
status
is
irrelevant.
it
is
the
time
of
the
retaliatory
act
or
the
time
of
dis...
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i...
i
disagree
with
the
construction,
because
i
do
think
it
depends
on
when
you
have
to
identify
the
employee.
now,
the
words
are
the
same.
it
is
used
the
same.
but
i
would
add
something
else,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
it
can
mean
either...
it
can
mean
an
employee
at
the
time
the
event
occurred.
also,
under
703--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--that...
that's
right,
at
the
time
he
fills
out
the
form.
but
are
we
under
703
or
704?
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
your
honor,
i
do
accept
that
argument.
but
i
would
point
out
there
is
an
additional
word
that
i
think
does
bear
looking
at
under
section
704.
employers
are
told
that
they
are
responsible
for
his
employees.
and
i
think
if
you
go...
if
you
take
the
common
usage
of
that
term
and
you
go
to
any
employer
in
this
country,
and
you
say,
for
whatever
purpose,
you're
responsible
for
your
employees...
his
employees...
no
one
is
going
to
assume
that,
well,
gee,
i
guess
that
means
i'm
responsible
for
joe
blow
who
works
for
me--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--exactly.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
certainly.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
right.
and--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
there
is
no
reason
not
to
accept
the
normal
construction
of
the
word
704.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
because
if
you
look
at
who
that--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--affects,
the
"individual"
language
is
used
for
employment
agencies.
so
if
an
employment
agency...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
looking
at
703--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--yeah,
i'm
sorry.
right.
it...
it...
it
does
relate
to
employment
agencies,
joint
labor
management
committees.
well,
certainly
the
person
would
not
be
an
employee
of
the
agency
or
the
labor
management
committee
or
other
training
programs.
that's
why
they
have
to
use
the
word
"individual"
there.
but
i
think
it's
telling
that
they
didn't
use
"individual"
throughout.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's...
that's
certainly
true.
and
i
think
the
point
there
is
that
it
demonstrates
that
704
is
a
narrowly
constructed
statute.
it
is
not
even--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i
would...
i
would
agree
with
you
to
this
extent:
that
once
the
employment
is
over,
yes,
704
does
not
apply.
if
the
employment
relationship
is
ongoing,
yes,
it
does
apply.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
yeah.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
to
the
extent
an
employer
is
motivated
by
a
desire
to
give
negative
references,
i'd
agree
with
that.
but
that's
a
little--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--sure.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
correct.
i
do
think
that
the
statute
does
contain
a
bright-line
test.
and
that
bright
line
is
whether
or
not
you
have
an
employment
relationship.
i
listened
with
great
interest
to
the
case
that
was
argued
just
before
mine.
and
what
interested
me
was
not
whether
or
not
the
court
decides
between
the
payroll
plan
or
the
day-by-day
plan
and
counting
the
number
of
employees,
but
the
fact
that
each
of
the
speakers
in
this
morning's
argument
said
that,
at
least
to
be
an
employee
under
that
section
of
the
statute,
you
had
to
have
an
ongoing
employment
relationship.
and
i
couldn't
agree
more.
you
cannot
have
an
ongoing
employment
relationship...
and
if
you
do
not
have
an
ongoing
employment
relationship,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
be
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
certainly
true.
but
i
do
think
that
it...
it's
a
strained
argument
to
suggest
that
"employee"
means
different
things
in
different
places
within
the
act.
and
to...
for
the
eeoc
to
insist--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--perhaps
i
should
have
accepted
his
help.
[laughter]
but
i
think
that
the
test
that
has
been
established--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--i
think
the
test
that
has
been
established
does
make
some
sense...
not
that
i'm
trying
to
divine
the
will
of
congress
from
32
years
ago.
i
don't
think
any
of
us
can
do
that.
but
the
point
that
you
brought
up,
justice
o'connor,
about
there
being
other
remedies
available
under
common
law,
is
certainly
true
in
this
instance
in
particular.
and
in
fact,
it
seems
to
be
a
burgeoning
area
of
the
law
for
the
states
to
enact
employment
reference
statutes
that
protect
both
the
employee
and
an
ability
to
get
an
employment
reference
and
the
employer,
to
protect
them
against
frivolous
claims.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
well,
i
would
disagree
in
this
case
certainly,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
eeoc
position,
the
petitioner's
position,
is
not
supported
by
the
statutory
language.
i
mean,
it's
all
well
and
good
to
speak
about
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
act,
but
congress
doesn't
pass
declarations
of
policy.
it
doesn't
pass
resolutions
of
purpose.
it
passes
statutes.
and
we
have
to
read
the
statute
to
see
what
it
is
they
wanted
to
do.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
from
a
linguist's
standpoint,
i
think
that's
absolutely
true.
but
statutes
aren't
passed
for
linguists;
they're
passed
for
ordinary
citizens.
and
if
we
accept--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--i
think
if
you...
if
you
try
to
analyze
the
language
into
whether
it's
active
or
passive
voice,
and
whether
it's
past
or
present
tense,
you
completely
lose
sight
of
what
any
ordinary
individual
would
read
when
they
read
704...
that
an
employer
cannot
do
certain
things
to
his
employees.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i...
i
would
say
it
would
be
highly
illegal,
but
not
necessarily
under
this
act.
i
think
it
would--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--erisa.
you
couldn't
get
away
with
it.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
true.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
well,
we--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--exactly.
[laughter]
you
took
the
words
right
out
of
my
mouth.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i
find
the
statute,
alone,
impenetrable,
so
the
legislative
history,
i
doubt
it'd
be
any
help.
i
would
conclude,
your
honor,
by
suggesting
that
a
strained
interpretation
or,
in
fact,
really,
a
rewording
of
704
is
what
the
petitioner
is
asking
for...
to
include
terms
that
were
not
included
when
this
act
was
passed
32
years
ago.
and
if
you
do
that,
then
you
will
lead
to
absurd
results.
it
will
create
is
disincentive
for
employers
to
ever
issue
any
reference.
they'd
either
issue
no
references,
all
good
references,
or
all
bad
references.
because
if
they
do
anything
else,
they're
setting
themselves
up
for
a
claim
of
retaliation
by
anyone
who
had
previously
filed
a
charge,
valid
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
crue.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
true.
as
long
as
you
can
prove
that
the
issuance
of
a
reference
is
a
benefit
of
employment,
yes,
you
do
have
that
problem.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
oh,
yeah.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i
agree.
that's
right.
you
can
do
that.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
well--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--well,
timing
is
everything.
and
under
the
act,
the
time
of
the
act
is
important
to
determine
the
status.
and
the
act
does
offer
more
protection
to
people
who
are
employed
to
those
who
are
not
employed.
and
i
think
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act,
such
as
we
can
divine
from
what
they...
they
wrote.
because
the
act
was
not
meant
to
be
a
bad
acts
law.
it
was
not
designed
to
cure
all
forms
of
discrimination--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--well--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--i
would
hesitate
to
say
"home
free",
only
because
there
are
other
acts,
other
statutes,
other
causes
of
actions--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--yeah,
for--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--for
the...
yes,
for...
if
you
narrow
it
down
to
the
purposes
of
704(a),
yeah,
i
agree
with
you.
but
there
are
other
acts
and
laws
that
would
have
to
come
into
play.
it
would
be
very
foolish
for
an
employer
to
retaliate
against
anyone.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
well,
if
he's
no
longer
employed,
my--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--yeah,
oh--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--i
see.
i
see
what
you're
saying.
no--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--i...
i
don't
think
he
is.
because...
and
i
think
the...
the
circuit
courts
that
have
tried
to
address
that
type
of
question
have...
have
retreated
into
language
about
it
being
reasonably
related
to
the
employment.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
no,
actually,
it
does
not--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--it's
a
shorthand
term.
it
says
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
having
made
a
charge,
participated
in
a
investigation
or
proceeding.
and
that's
just
a
shorthand
term.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
well,
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
your
honor,
would
be
that
he's
treating
them
differently
than
the
people
who
have
not
made
charges.
and,
in
that
sense,
it's
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
exactly
right.
the
words
vii,
so
it
is...
it's
different.
you
know,
you
don't
need
to
look
any
further
than
the
facts
of
this
case
to
see
what
types
of
results
can
accrue.
because
we
have
tried
the
discrimination
case.
and
as
part
of
the
discrimination
case,
we
had
to
prove...
i
had
to
put
on
evidence
that
showed
all
of
the
events
that
form
the
basis
for
the
discharge.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
absolutely.
and
that's
what
justice
motts...
judge
motts,
in
baltimore,
ruled,
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
we
put
on
that
evidence
and,
in
effect,
proved
the
reasons
for
discharging
the
individual.
and
yet,
truth
is
no
defense--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--they
are
the
basis
for
the
reference,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
correct.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
reference
that
says
that
the
man
filed
a
charge
of
discrimination.
we
simply--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--no
it
wouldn't
be,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
it
wouldn't
be,
your
honor,
because
of
it
being
two
different
statutes,
and
each
statute
has
a
separate
basis
for
discrimination.
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
or
religion
or
national
origin,
but,
rather,
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
having
filed
a
charge
or
participated
in
a
proceeding.
now,
but
i
do
think
that
i'd
be
entitled
to
collateral
estoppel
effect
for
the
evidence
that
was
put
on,
on
the
events
themselves
that
led
to
the
discharge.
well,
those
events
were
the
basis
for
giving
a
bad
employment
reference.
you
know,
it's
not
like
title
vii
ignores
what
happens
to
people
after
they
lose
their
employment.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
well,
i
think
so.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i...
i
think
so.
but
i
don't
think
i
should
even
have
to
put
that
evidence
on
twice.
i've
tried
this
case
once.
i
don't
think
i
should
have
to
try
it
again,
because
he's
not
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
no,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
and
that
would
have
been
the
motion
i
filed
if
my
motion
to
dismiss
hadn't
been
granted.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
you're
exactly
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
exactly
right.
no;
it
would
take
additional
evidence,
other
than
what
was
put
on--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--that's
true.
that's
true.
so,
you
know,
even
though
we
have
proved
the
truth
of
the
underlying
basis,
that
truth
forms
no
defense,
absolute,
against
a
claim
of
retaliation
under
704(a).
so
we're
left
with
having
told
the
truth
about
a
former
employee,
and
yet,
find
ourselves
accused
of
retaliation
under
704.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
exactly.
it
would...
it
would
be
pretty
much
the
same
as
any
defamation
action
in
any
state.
but,
you
know,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
704--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--sir?
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
in
discharge
cases?
quite
often.
they
do
give
references.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
where
it's
discharge
for
cause?
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
even
at
that,
we
will--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--it
precludes
any
claim
of
retaliation
by
someone,
after
they've
dis...
been
discharged,
whether
it's
frivolous
or
whether
it's
serious.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
you're...
you're
quite
correct.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
correct.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
also
point
out
that
that
does...
the
act
itself
does
give
a
cause
of
action
to
someone
caught
in
that
situation.
and
the
act
points
them
to
the
direction
of
the
next
employer,
the
prospective
employer.
because
if
the
second
employer
will
refuse
to
hire
somebody,
will
not
accept
their
application
in
retaliation
for
having
filed
a
charge
or
participated
in
a
proceeding,
that
is
a
704--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--no,
i
don't,
because
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
that
the
person
who
is
doing
the
hiring.
i
think
it...
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--that's
right.
it
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
yes.
we
may
be
getting
ourselves
in
trouble
by
using
the
shorthand
term
of
"retaliation".
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i
would
agree;
if
it
is
a
truthful
reference,
why
should
there
be?
if
the
employer
is
making
a
truthful
reference
about
someone,
does
the
employee
really
deserve
to
be
protected?
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
well--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--that's
right.
or
if
he
could
somehow
prove
that
whatever
statements
were
made
in
the
letter
were
actually
fabricated
because
of
that,
because
of
the
charge,
and
he
knew
about
it,
the
prospective
employer
knew...
knew
about
it--
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
--then
you
could
make
a
case
on
that,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
butler
i...
i
would
think
not.
but...
you
know,
it
wasn't
extensively
discussed
in
any
of
the
briefs,
but
i
was
struck
by
an
analysis
that
chief
justice
toflatt,
in
the
11th
circuit,
wrote
in
1990,
where
he
analyzed
this
whole
claim
under
court
v.
ash,
and
whether
there
would
be
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
that
test.
and
he
said
there's
no
conclusion
other
than
it
cannot.
because
there
is
a
remedy
contained
within
the
statute.
and
what
you're
doing
is
trying
to
broaden
that
statute
for
an
additional
remedy
against
additional
parties.
and
that's
not...
you
know,
that's
not
what
you
should
be
doing,
in
recognizing
a
new
cause
of
action.
i
think
the...
the
language
of
the
statute
is
very
plain.
i
think
it...
it's
plain
to
employers,
certainly.
and
we
can
only
assume
it
was
plain
to
congress
when
they
wrote
it.
this
act
applies
to
employees
and
applicants
for
employment.
it
does
not
apply
to
anyone
else.
those
two
groups
will
always
be
able
to
claim
their
rights
under
704,
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
this
case.
but
to
rewrite
this
act
to
include
former
employees
will
only
destroy
the
act
by
destroying
the
certainty
of
the
statute
itself.
if
you
rewrite
it,
then
no
one
will
be
sure
what
it
means
in
the
future,
and
to
whom
it
will
apply.
i
think
we're
best
sticking
with
the
bright
line.
once
the
employment
is
over,
any
rights
under
704
have
terminated.
thank
you.
