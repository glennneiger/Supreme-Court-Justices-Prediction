--a
purpose
that's
not
relevant
in
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
traditional
common-law
type
employee
versus
an
independent
contractor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not...
it's
not
circular
for
that
purpose,
but
it
just
doesn't
speak
to
what's
at
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
wouldn't
this
play
out
in
how...
suppose
this
case
had
gone
to
court.
the
employer
says,
we
gave
an
honest
reference.
the
plaintiff
is
then
out
of
court
unless
the
plaintiff
shows
that's
a
pretext,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a...
that's
a
legitimate
nonretaliatory
reason.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
the
point
you
made
before.
you
are
saying,
commonly,
people
know
that
they're
on
their
way
out,
and
so
they
start
looking
around
for
a
job
earlier.
so,
the...
exactly,
the
employer
is...
faces
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
references
for
people
who
are
currently
on
the
work
force,
but
they
didn't
get
the
promotion,
so
they're
just
biding
their
time
till
they
get
a
new
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
exactly
the
same
problem
for
the
employer.
but
doesn't
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if...
if
the
interpretation
that
you
are
opposing
were
the
law,
then
the
message
to
the
employer
is,
don't
keep
that
person
on
and
give
him
time
to
look
for
another
job;
get
rid
of
him.
because
as
soon
as
he's
a
nonemployee,
then
he
has
nothing
that
he
can
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
don't
you
think
that
language
in
the
definition
section
can
be
read
two
ways?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you've
already...
you've
already
acknowledged
that
the
word
"employee",
the
word
"employee",
in
this
very
statute,
means
former
employee
in
a
number
of
contexts.
one,
the
time
you
have
to
file
a
charge.
it
uses
the
word
"employee",
right?
it
doesn't
say
"former
employee".
it
just
says
"employee",
but
obviously
it's
talking
about
former
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the
statute
uses
the
word
"employee".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
statute
uses
the
word
"employee"
to
describe
an
individual--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--who
happens
to
be
a
former
employee.
but
the
statute
identifies
that
individual
as
"employee",
and
everybody
knows
that
"employee"...
the
word
"employee",
in
that
statute,
means
former
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
statute
says
an
employee
may
file
a
charge
within
x
number
of
days--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
that
word
"employee"
mean
current
employee
and
former
employee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
butler,
would
it
cover
a
case
where
an
applicant...
an
employee...
current
employee...
doesn't
get
the
promotion
and
is...
stays
on
the
payroll,
continues
to
work,
but
is
looking
for
another
job;
in
the
course
of
that
job
search,
gets
a
reference
which
that
employee
says
is
retaliatory?
such
a
person
would
have
both
the
discrimination
claim,
the
703
claim
and
the
retaliation
claim,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
be
a
baseless
claim,
it
may
be
a
frivolous
claim,
but
he
has
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
now,
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
that
i
was
putting
before
to
mr.
wolfson.
doesn't
that
scenario
mean
that
the
employer,
once
he
doesn't
give
the
promotion
to
this
person,
should
say,
and
you're
out,
because
if
the
employer
keeps
the
person
on
for
any
interval,
then
the
employer
is
subject
to
retaliation
charge;
but
the
employer
can
insulate
the
company
from
any
retaliation
charge
by
saying,
if
we
don't
promote
this
person,
they're
out
the
door...
we
don't
keep
them
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
incentive
for
the
employer,
of
your
reading,
is
get
rid
of
the
person?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
we
insulate
ourself,
at
least
from
the
retaliation
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
butler,
assuming...
and
i
think
we
would
all
recognize
that
your
interpretation
is
a
reasonable
one.
if
one
also
thinks
that
the
eeoc's
interpretation
is
a
reasonable
one,
without
giving
any
undue
deference,
shouldn't
the
court
respect
the
agency
that
is
administering
the
statute
day
in
and
day
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
the...
the...
the
problem
that
you
brought
up,
which
is
a
real
one,
about
truthfulness
in
performance
ratings
and
the
remedy
for
that,
do
you
make
a
false
representation...
all
of
that
is
just
the
same
if
you
give
the
reference
before
the
person
leaves
your
employ.
so
you
don't...
so
you're
putting
out
that
this
is
a
problem...
yes,
it's
a
problem,
but
the
problem
doesn't
depend
upon
whether
former
employees
are
covered.
the
problem
exists
for
current
employees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
not
a
reason
to
reject
inclusion
of
former
employees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
your
answer
to
me
does
say,
then,
for
whatever
reason,
employers,
you
are
home
free
by
discharging
someone;
you
will
not
be
by
keeping...
keeping
that
person--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
current
position,
where
the
person
is
doing
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
least
for
purposes
of
title
vii.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
purposes
of
the
retaliation
section.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
nobody
is
disagreeing
with
that.
i
think
the
eeoc
would
agree
with
you
that...
that
you
have
a
very
strong
defense
to
this
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
whether
you
have
to
defend.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
go
back
to
my
question
about
how
much
of
a
trial
is
involved.
don't
you...
aren't
you
a
situation
of
getting
summary
judgment
just
by
putting
in
the...
the...
the
result
of
the
prior
trial,
and
then,
the
plaintiff
has
to...
has
a
pretty
heavy
burden
to
overcome.
if
he
can't
do
anything,
to
say
it
was
all
a
pretext
or
whatever.
the...
that
plaintiff
would
never
get
to
trial
on
a
case
like
this,
would
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
wouldn't
somebody
who
is
not
yet
an
employer
retaliate?
that...
i
know
that
was
in
your
brief,
but
that
seemed
to
me
very
strange.
the...
the
employer
that
has
fired
a
person
gives
a
bad
reference,
and
then
your
suggesting,
well,
there
may
be
a
claim
against
the
next
person
who
won't
hire
that
person
in
reliance...
i
mean
as
a...
as
a
lawyer,
don't
you,
don't
you
have
a
much
stronger
case
against
the
one
who
gave
the
reference,
allegedly
false,
than
the
one
who
credited
it?
