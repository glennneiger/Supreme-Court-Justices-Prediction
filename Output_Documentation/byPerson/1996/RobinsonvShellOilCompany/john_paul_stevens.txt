justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
are...
what
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
can
you
speak
for
the...
can
you
speak
for
the
respondent
on
that
issue?
the
respondent's
literal,
plain
language
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
applies
there
as
well
as
here.
how...
how
do
you
know
the
respondent
will
agree
with
justice
kennedy's
suggestion?
i
don't
think
you
have
authority
to
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
wolfson--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
mr.
wolfson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there?
one
of
the
troubling
things
about
the
case
is,
even
assuming
a
former
employee
may
be
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
can
file
a
charge
and
so
forth,
is
it
clear
that
the
employer
can
discriminate
against
a
former
employee?
why
is
it
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
their
policy
assumes
to
tell
the
truth
in
all...
in
all...
you
know,
whether
they
like
the
employee
or
not,
they
say,
we
didn't
like
this
guy...
that's
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
not
if
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
on
filing
charges,
it
says
an
employee
may
file
a
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
though
he's
a
former
employee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
has
been--
--how
do
you
resolve
the...
excuse
me--
--go
ahead.
how
do
you
resolve
the
debate
between
justice
kennedy
and
me?
is
an...
is
a
retired
employee
who's
getting
a
pension
still
an
employee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
agree
with
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
you
lose
the
case?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
butler,
i...
i
know
there's
an
answer
to
this,
and
i'm
really
asking
you
for
help
on
it.
in
704
that's
quoted
on
page
4
of
your
text,
there's
also
reference
to
discriminating
against
any
individual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
can't
be
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
it
refers
back...
it
says
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
sowing
all
sorts
of
dissension
in
the
court
here,
you
know.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the...
if
you
go
back
to
the
pension
example,
there
are
some
pension
plans
that
allow
disability
benefits
or,
say,
benefits
based
on
length
of
service
and
so
forth.
and
the
disability
plans
will
often
require
a
medical
examination
to
qualify
for
that
particular
benefit.
and
you're
suggesting
that
the
company
could
say
to
the
doctor,
black
former
employees,
find
them
not
disabled,
but
doctors,
of
others
employees,
they
could.
and
that
doesn't
seem
likely
to
fit
into
the
scheme
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
act
would
it
violate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
all
right.
but
this,
of
course,
came
before
erisa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
have
been...
it
would
have
been
perfectly
lawful
until
erisa
was
passed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
only
find
that
out
if
you
go
into
the
legislative
history
of
erisa...
and...
and
great
doubts.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
that
evidence
also
show
that
you're...
the
discrimination
charge
has
no
merit?
