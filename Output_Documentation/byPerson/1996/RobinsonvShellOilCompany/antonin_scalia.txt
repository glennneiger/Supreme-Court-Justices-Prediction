justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it's
the
time
of
the
discrimination
that...
that...
that's
relevant
for
704(a)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
person
who
is
fired
because
he
filed
a
complaint--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
an
employee
at
the
time
he
was
fired.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
would
be...
he
would
be
well
covered,
even
if
"employee"
means
only
current
employee?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
--if
he's
fired
as
a
means
of
retal...
if
he's
either
not
promoted
or
fired--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
a
means
of
retaliation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
would
be
covered
under
704(a),
even
if
704(a)
is
just
limited
to
current
employees,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
congress
contemplate
that?
i
would...
if
i
were
a
congressman,
i
would
have
had
a
hard
time
figuring
out
how
an
employer
could
retaliate
against
somebody
who
is
no
longer
an
employee.
he
could
retaliate
by
refusing
to
rehire
the
guy,
perhaps.
but,
in
that
case,
he's
covered,
because
he
would
be
an
applicant
for
employment.
but
the
notion
that
he
could
retaliate
once...
once
the
employ...
employment
relationship
is
terminated...
i
mean,
i
guess
he
could...
he
could
send
somebody
over
to...
to
mug
him
or
something
like
that,
but--
--how
about
cutting
off
his
pension
benefits?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
surely
that
would
be
unlawful,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
would...
would
you
need
this
act
to...
to
prevent
his...
that's
like
sending
somebody
over
to
mug
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that?
you
have
laws
against
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
wouldn't
violate
this
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
never
mind
that...
suppose
the
retaliation
comes
not
from
the
employer
but
from
the...
the
individual
employee,
and
not
within
the
scope
of
the
business
at
all...
whom
the...
whom
the...
the
complainant
charged
with
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
individual
goes
in
the...
scratches
his
car
or
slashes
his
tires
or...
or
destroys
his
home
or
something
of
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
that
be
covered
by
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
would...
would
that
be
covered
by
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
not
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so...
so
you
acknowledge
there
are
some
limitations
within
the
act
upon
retaliation?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
all
retaliation
is
meant
to
be
protected?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
we're
arguing
about
is
whether
one
of
the
limitations
is
a
limitation
between
present
employer
and
former
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you'd
give
any
references
if
there
is
even
the
slightest
risk
of
your
being
sued
for
it.
i
don't
know
why
you'd
give...
why...
why
would
an
employer
give
any
references?
what...
what
is
there
in
it
for
him,
if...
if
there's
a...
a
possible
liability
attached?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume...
i
assume
that
the...
that
the
employer
cannot
protect
himself
when
he
gets
a
request
for
a
reference
by
simply
saying,
you
know,
i
do
normally
give
references,
but
i'm
sorry,
in
the
case
of
this
employee,
i
don't
want
to
say
anything
either
good
or
bad,
because
he
had
filed
a
complaint
and
i'm
worried
about
being
prosecuted.
you
would
say
that
that
is
discrimination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
giving
a
reference
either
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
the
only
way
for
the
employer
to
be
sure
that
he...
that
he
won't
be
sued
is
not
to
give
any
references
for
any
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
different
argument.
and
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
make
that
argument,
that...
that
it
can
mean
other
things
in...
in
other
contexts,
but
in
this
context
it
doesn't.
i
really
think
you're
taking
on
a
terrible
burden,
to
say
that
it
always
and
everywhere
means
a
current
employee.
it
quite
obviously
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
normal
meaning
is
a
current
employer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--although,
in
some
contexts,
it's...
it
can
be
used
differently.
that's
unusual,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
some
contexts,
you...
you
have
to
understand
that
it...
it's
being
used
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
this
is
just
the
normal
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it's
not
all
that
telling.
because
"individual"
is
a
lot
broader
than
"present
and
former
employee".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can...
you
could
want
"employee"
to
include
former
employees
without
wishing
it
to
include
everybody
in
the
world,
former
employee
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
doesn't
have
to
fire
him.
he
could
just...
he
could
just
tell
him,
i'll...
i'll
write
you
a
letter
but...
but
not
now.
my
policy
is
to
write
reference
letters
after
you've
left
the
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
would
handle
the
problem,
wouldn't
it?
you
don't
have
to
fire
him;
just
say,
i...
i
don't
give
any
reference
letters
for
anybody
while
you're
still
employed
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
you
say,
that's
why
they
passed
erisa,
right,
to
bag
that
guy?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true.
but
as...
as...
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
that
problem
isn't...
isn't
entirely
solved
by
how
we
come
out
on
this
case.
because
you
do
have
the
problem
of
references
for
current
employees.
and...
and
you
do
subject
yourself--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
a
problem
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
don't
even
have
to
show
that.
if
it's
a
retal...
retaliatory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't...
doesn't
have
to
be
a
term
or
condition.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
butler,
it
just
occurs
to
me,
is
it
entirely
clear
that
the...
the
phrase,
"to
discriminate
against
any
of
his
employees.
"
is...
is
cut
apart
from...
with
respect
to
terms
or
conditions
of
employment?
i
mean,
suppose
i
run
a
very
small
business
and...
and
somebody...
what
happens
is
what
happens
here...
somebody
files
a...
a
discrimination
complaint
that
is
totally
groundless.
i
don't
fire
the
individual,
because
i'm...
i'm
afraid
that
that'll
be
considered
retaliation.
however,
i
used
to
have
other
members
of...
or
other
employees
home
for
dinner
with
my
wife
and
me
with
some
frequency,
and
i
no
longer
invite
this
fellow,
because
i
don't
like
him
anymore--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
he
filed
this
frivolous
complaint.
is
that
covered
by
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
he's
still
employed.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
still
employed.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--reasonably
related
to
the
employment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
set
forth
those
same
reasons
in
the
reference
to
the
new
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same...
the
same
reasons
that
had
been
affirmed
in
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know.
why
couldn't
he
put
on
the
fact
that
you...
you,
the
employer...
had
some
very
mean
things
to
say
about
him
after
this
complaint
was
filed,
and
after
you
were
vindicated
in
court,
and
you
said,
that...
you
know,
that
son
of
a
gun,
we
got
him.
and
he
is
an
odious
and
hateful
person.
all
right.
and...
and...
and
this
is
all
put
on
the
record.
and
the
allegation
to
be
made
would
be,
oh,
yes,
there
were
good
reasons
for
the
bad
recommendation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
in
fact,
the
motive
here...
the
truth
isn't
a
defense,
is
it?
if...
if
the...
if
the
motive
is
retaliatory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
matter
that
what
you
say
is
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
convince
a
jury
that
this
is
not
only
true,
but
that
the
real
reason
you
wrote
that
letter
was...
was
what...
i
don't
know...
to
be
helpful
to
the
new
employer,
rather
than
to
retaliate
against
this
fellow
you've
called
hateful
and
odious?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
jury
might
not
believe
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
if
truth
were
a
defense,
this
retaliatory
cause
of
action
would...
would
give
this
particular
plaintiff
no...
no...
no
more
benefit
than
would
the
normal
libel
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
retaliation,
of
course,
but
the
statute
doesn't
use
the
word
"retaliation"?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
are
a...
a
prospective
employer
and
you
turn
down
an
applicant
because
i
don't
want
to
hire
an
applicant
who
has
filed
an
eeoc
complaint
with
his
previous
employer...
this
guy
is
a
troublemaker...
it
wouldn't
really
be
retaliation,
but
it
would
violate
this
provision,
because
it
specifically
refers
to
applicants
for
employment,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
retaliation.
