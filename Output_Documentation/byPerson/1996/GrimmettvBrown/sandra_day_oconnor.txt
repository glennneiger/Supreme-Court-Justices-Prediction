justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
also
representing
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
the
interests
seem
to
diverge
a
little
bit--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
i
was
a
little
curious
about
how
your
argument
was
going
to
cover
both.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
you
tell
us
just
preliminarily
please
whether
vincent
siragusa
has...
at
one
point
the
bankruptcy
order
had
discharged
vincent
siragusa's
debts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
that
ever
been...
has
an
order
come
from
the
bankruptcy
court
changing
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
see
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
order
issued
from
the
bankruptcy
court
reflecting
any
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
say
it
is,
but
we
won't
find
it
anywhere
in
these
papers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
assets
were
transferred,
and
the
trustee
therefore
collected
less
money
in
the
bankruptcy
estate.
that
happened,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
a
settlement
between
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
and
the
individuals
who
got
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
and...
we're
talking
about
the
trustee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
trustee
get
the
assets
back
into
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--bankruptcy
estate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes...
yes,
but
if
there
are
two
predicate
acts
insofar
as
she
is
concerned,
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
and,
second,
the
transfer
of
the
assets
of
the
medical
practice,
that's
enough
to
establish
a
pattern
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
it
is,
that
we
think
it
is
enough,
and
this
other
story
about
another
doctor,
well,
fine,
but
it
was
complete
as
of
the
time
the
bankruptcy
petition
was
filed
and
the
transfer
then
was
made,
plus
mailings
and
calls
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
just
looking
at
what
the
record
discloses
here,
and
what's
being
alleged,
and
enough
is
being
alleged
apparently
to
establish
both
a
claimed
injury
by
her
and
a
series
of
acts
that
would
qualify
as
a
pattern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
included
all
these
facts
in
the
complaint,
and
if
it's
laid
out,
there
it
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact,
it's
a
complaint
that
went
on
for
130-some
pages.
you've
got
plenty
in
there,
all
over
the
place.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
she
now
chooses
to
proceed
with.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
she
filed
this
complaint
in...
what
year
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
november
'93.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
claimed
injury
and
claimed
a
rico
cause
of
action,
and
we
have
to
decide
among
other
things,
i
guess,
when
a
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run,
and
is
there
anything
we
can
agree
on
at
all
in
this
messy
case?
do
you
agree
that
at
least
the
elements
of
the
rico
claim
have
to
exist
before
the
statute
can
run?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
means
an
injury
and
a
pattern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
in
fact
there
may
well
have
been
a
pattern
already.
there
was
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
with
the
fraudulent
intent,
as
she
alleges,
and
there
was
the
transfer
of
the
assets.
that's
the
second
thing.
so
we
already
see
a
pattern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
whether
she
understands
the
cause
of
action
correctly
is
something
this
court
has
said
doesn't
matter.
you
don't
have
to
understand
the
medical
malpractice
law
to
have
the
statute
start
to
run.
if
she
knows
the
acts,
and
if
those
acts
add
up
to
a
cause
of
action,
then
okay,
you
can
start
the
statute
running.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
she
doesn't
have
to
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
she
doesn't
have
to
understand
what
all
would
be
considered
as
part
of
the
pattern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
a
lot
more,
wasn't
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
vincent
was
paid
a
continuing
salary
that
was
as
much
or
more
than
he
had
earned
before.
there
was
a
continued
operation
of
this
new
enterprise
and
it
put
more
money
in
his
pocket
than
he
had
had
before.
this
went
on
and
on.
now,
that,
under
our
case
law
at
least,
can
establish
a
pattern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
is
your
point
in
reading--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
there
an
injury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
there's
another
aspect
to
the
rule.
do
we
look
at
whether
the
plaintiff
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
injury
and/or
the
pattern,
or
do
we
just
look
at
whether
there
was
actual
knowledge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
should-have-known
component.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet,
in
circumstances
where
fraud
is
an
element,
the
courts
have
fairly
often
applied
the
should-have-known
thing,
and
rico
often
involves
claims
that
turn
on
fraud.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
course,
there's
a
claim
here
that
there's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--there's
a
claim
now
that
there's
no
injury
at
all,
that
in
fact...
and
there's
some
evidence
that
petitioner
joanne
is
better
off
now
than
ever
before.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
bankruptcy
case
is
not
in
fact
over.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
has
been
no
final
discharge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
not
over.
there's
been
no
final
distribution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
who
are
creditors
remaining?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
she
is
the
only
one
now
remaining?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
the
rico
claim
were
valid
i
guess
treble
damages
would
be
in
order.
