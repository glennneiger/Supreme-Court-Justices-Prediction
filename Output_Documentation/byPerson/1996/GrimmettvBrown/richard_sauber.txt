mr.
richard
sauber
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
client,
joanne
siragusa,
possessed
a
debt
owed
to
her
by
her
husband--
mr.
richard
sauber
--yes,
we
are,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
sauber
i
think
the
application--
mr.
richard
sauber
--the
application
on
the
first
issue
of
the
banker's
trust
issue,
by
definition,
since
it
rests
on
a
conclusion
of
the
bankruptcy,
i
think
only
applies
to
her
definition
of
injury
at
this
point,
and
not
to
the
trustee's
interest.
the...
her
preexisting
debt
owed
to
her
by
her
husband
was
not
part
of
the
racketeering
scheme
and
not
alleged
to
be
so.
when
he
went
into
bankruptcy
owing
her
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
$1.4
million
as
a
result
of
a
property
settlement,
that
debt
was
a
preexisting
legitimate
debt
unrelated
to
the
racketeering
activity
as
alleged
in
the
racketeering
complaint.
mr.
richard
sauber
yes.
he
received
a
statutory
preliminary
discharge.
mr.
richard
sauber
yes.
joanne
and--
mr.
richard
sauber
--joanne
and
the
trustee
objected
within
the
1
year
of
his
statutory
discharge,
claiming
that
the
discharge
had
been
obtained
by
fraud.
that
was
the
adversary
complaint.
ultimately
in
1994
vincent
settled
both
with
the
estate
and
with
joanne
individually
and
agreed
that
his
discharge--
mr.
richard
sauber
--the...
there
is
an
order.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
record,
but
there
is
an
order
from
the
bankruptcy
court
accepting
the
settlement
which
includes
giving
up
his
discharge,
so
as
of
1994
his
preliminary
discharge
was
revoked.
mr.
richard
sauber
i
don't
believe
it's
in
this
record,
no.
mr.
richard
sauber
yes,
sir.
the
preliminary
discharge
in
a
chapter
7
bankruptcy
is
granted
within
a
certain
number
of
months
as
long
as
no
one...
none
of
the
creditors
of
the
trustee
object.
subject
to
a
1-year
period
beyond
the
automatic
granting
of
that
preliminary
discharge
the
other
creditors
and
the
trustee
can
object
to
the
discharge
on
the
ground
that
it
was
obtained
by
fraud.
joanne
siragusa
and
the
trustee
did
file
in
may
of
1989--
mr.
richard
sauber
--yes.
joanne
and
the
trustee
filed
in
may
of
1989
an
adversary
complaint
alleging
that,
among
other
things,
the
discharge
granted
to
vincent
preliminarily
was
obtained
by
fraud.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
that
was
the
date
on
which
joanne
was
injured.
our
position
is
that
her
debt,
her
preexisting
debt
was
the
same
the
day
before
she
filed
that
complaint
as
it
was
the
day
after.
the
focus
of
the
racketeering
scheme
in
this
case
is
focused
on
a
bankruptcy
fraud.
it's
a
classic
attempt
to
get
out
from
under
a
legal
obligation
to
pay
a
debt.
mr.
richard
sauber
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
sauber
the...
there
are
two
ways
in
which
joanne
can
be
injured
by
this
bankruptcy
fraud.
one
is
if
the
debtor
obtains
a
discharge
of
its...
of
his
obligation
to
pay
her.
that's
now
been
removed.
mr.
richard
sauber
secondly,
if
she
is
forced
to
accept
at
the
end
of
the
bankruptcy
less
than
100
percent
of
the
debt
he
owed
her
when
he
started
this
scheme,
and
that
reduction
is
caused
by
the
racketeering
activity,
that
is
her
racketeering
injury
at
that
point.
mr.
richard
sauber
well,
our
position
is
that
until
the
bankruptcy
is
complete
and
over,
whether
or
not
she's
been
injured,
whether
or
not
her
preexisting
non-rico
debt
has
been
affected
by
the
racketeering
activity
cannot
be
determined.
mr.
richard
sauber
she
filed
a
protective
cause
of
action.
mr.
richard
sauber
well,
it
was...
if
i
may,
it
was
dismissed,
banker's
trust,
without
prejudice.
she
was
concerned
that
she
was
in
a
jurisdiction
that
would
not
accept
the
banker's
trust
line
of
cases,
and
she
filed
a
protective
lawsuit
on
the
assumption
that...
on
the
fear
that
one
of
the
courts
in
her
jurisdiction
would
find
differently.
mr.
richard
sauber
well,
there
has
been
no
injury
to
joanne
if
you
accept
our
argument
with
respect
to
banker's
trust.
with
respect
to
the
trustee,
who
the
ninth
circuit
pegged
as
being
injured
in
may
of
1989,
his
case
is
still
related
to
the
second
question,
whether
or
not
you
decide
that
the
proper
approval
rule
in
this...
for
a
civil
rico
case
is
an
injury-in-pattern
discovery
rule.
if
you
decide
that,
then
his...
the
trustee's
injury
in
may
of
1989
doesn't
start
the
statute
of
limitations
ticking.
it
won't
tick
until
december
of
1990.
mr.
richard
sauber
well,
i
think
that
the
banker's
trust
line
of
cases
would
only
apply
to
joanne.
mr.
richard
sauber
yes,
your
honor.
that
would
only
apply
to
joanne
because
by
definition
it
assumes
that
the
bankruptcy
is
complete.
the
record
in
this
case
stands
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
concluded
that
the
trustee
was
injured
as
of
may
of
1989,
and
since
he
would
be
unaffected
by--
mr.
richard
sauber
--the
ninth
circuit
rests
its
decision
on
the
assumption
that
in
may
of
1989
joanne
and
the
trustee
recognized,
because
they
filed
their
adversary
complaint,
that
her
husband
has
tried
to
concoct
a
bankruptcy
scheme
to
get
out
from
paying
her
the
legal
obligation.
mr.
richard
sauber
well,
the
racketeering
complaint
which
was
filed
in
19--
mr.
richard
sauber
--well,
the
racketeering
complaint
is
different
from
the
adversary
complaint.
the
racketeering
complaint
was
filed
in
1993.
the
racketeering
activity
and
the
schemes
identified
are
the
scheme
to
defraud
her
of
her
legal
debt,
the
scheme
to
defraud
her
husband's
partners--
mr.
richard
sauber
--i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
in
may
of
1989
both
joanne
and
the
trustee
were
injured
by
the
recognition
that
vincent
had
filed
a
fraudulent
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
sauber
no.
it
hurt
their
interest
in
the
estate
by
attempting
fraudulently
to
transfer
the
assets
to
other
people.
mr.
richard
sauber
no.
he
fraudulently
transferred
his
interest
in
his
medical
practice
to
other
people.
that
was
the
whole
basis
of
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
richard
sauber
--well,
the
assets
were
transferred.
he
then...
the
trustee
then
did
proceed
against
the
recipients
of
that
property
in
an
attempt
to
get
them
back.
a
settlement
in
1992
was
entered
into
with
the
possessors
of
that
fraudulently
transferred
property.
at
the--
mr.
richard
sauber
--yes,
and
with
joanne
personally,
and
as
a
result--
mr.
richard
sauber
--yes.
mr.
richard
sauber
he
got
a--
mr.
richard
sauber
--i'm
sorry.
at
that
point,
justice
o'connor,
the
asset,
which
was
the
medical
practice--
mr.
richard
sauber
--had
diminished
in
value
and
they
entered
into
a
settlement
of
a
certain
amount
of
money
which
came
into
the
estate,
some
of
which
went
to
joanne
personally,
because
she
personally
settled
with
the
partners
at
that
point
also.
the
racketeering
scheme,
the
pattern
that's
alleged--
mr.
richard
sauber
--well,
the
estate
of
vincent
is...
has
not
yet
paid
off
its
lawful
debt
to
joanne.
mr.
richard
sauber
if
you
take
into
account
the
settlement,
it's
our
position
that
the
estate
at
this
point
has
lost
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
that
joanne,
by
definition,
has
also
lost
several
hundred
thousand
dollars.
mr.
richard
sauber
well,
i
think
that
it
clearly
is
the
reduction
in
value
of
the
business,
but
i
think
the
allegation
would
be
that
the
business
was
reduced
over
the
course
of
the
bankruptcy
because
of
the
bankruptcy
fraud,
that
the
proceeding
in
bankruptcy--
mr.
richard
sauber
--he's
pursuing
more.
the
business
was
only
worth
a
certain
amount
of
money
when
he
settled
with
the
partners,
and
he
is
still
pursuing
more
in
this
lawsuit.
that's
the
whole
point
of
his
attempting
to
bring
assets
back
into
the
estate
so
that
he
can
pay
out
the
creditors.
mr.
richard
sauber
well--
mr.
richard
sauber
--i
mean
something
in
addition
to
that,
his
submission
of
false
statements
throughout
the
bankruptcy
as
to
his
assets,
and
as
to
his
intentions,
but
basically,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
his
attempt
to
transfer
his
property,
claim
that
he
no
longer
has
the
assets
to
pay
off
his
debt
to
his
wife,
and
to
go
through
and
obtain
a
discharge.
that
was
the
heart
of
the
bankruptcy
fraud.
mr.
richard
sauber
yes.
that
is--
mr.
richard
sauber
--well,
the
point
of
the
fraudulent
conveyance
does
have
something
to
do
with
the
bankruptcy.
he
wanted
to
go
into
bankruptcy,
claim
that
he
no
longer
had
any
of
the
assets
to
pay
off
his
debts
because
he
had
now
transferred
them,
obtain
a
discharge
of
his
legal
debt
to
his
wife,
and
then
emerge
from
bankruptcy
and
regain
possession
of
the
assets
that
he
possessed
in
the
first
place.
that's
the
classic
bankruptcy
fraud.
that
was
the
scheme
here.
now,
it
turned
out
that
joanne
and
the
trustee
discovered
in
december
of
1990
that
this
scheme
also
had
other
potential
victims.
mr.
richard
sauber
the
earliest
predicate
acts
alleged
in
the
complaint
are
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy.
there
is
a
bankruptcy
fraud
as
a
predicate
act,
and
there
are
mail
and
wire
frauds.
the
scheme
alleged--
mr.
richard
sauber
--no.
i
think
that
suffices
in
that
there
are
more
than
two,
but
the
second
predicate
act
that
brings
in
the
pattern
is
the
defrauding
of
vincent's
partners.
mr.
richard
sauber
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
question
was
answered
by
this
court.
in
this--
mr.
richard
sauber
--there
may
have...
there
may
be
such
a
pattern,
but
in
this
case
she
alleged--
mr.
richard
sauber
--no,
i
would
disagree.
the
pattern
that
she
alleges
in
the
rico
complaint,
the
second
part
of
the
rico
complaint,
is
that
the
scheme
which
she
was
a
victim
of
also
served
to
defraud
others.
mr.
richard
sauber
it
may
or
it
may
not
be.
mr.
richard
sauber
but
justice
o'connor,
you
are
redefining
her
pattern
and
her
rico
case.
the
ninth
circuit
accepted
as
given
her
rico
complaint,
and
it
decided
that
if
it's
an
injury--
mr.
richard
sauber
--i
think
that
that
really
starts
to
sound
a
little
bit
to
us
like
overpleading
in
that
basically
she
was
in
a
dispute
with
her
husband.
he
tried
through
bankruptcy
to
get
out
from
having
to
pay
her.
now,
are
there
more
than
one
predicate
acts
which
you
could
then
allege
were
a
pattern,
and
that
there's
continuity,
and
relationship?
i
don't
know.
but
in
this
case
we
chose
not
to
allege
that
as
a
racketeering
case.
we
chose--
mr.
richard
sauber
--absolutely.
we
included
them--
mr.
richard
sauber
--it
is
quite
a
lengthy
and
quite
a
detailed
complaint,
but
the
pattern
that
she
does
allege
and
chooses
to
proceed
with
is
the
pattern
that
includes
the
other--
mr.
richard
sauber
--no--
mr.
richard
sauber
--19--
mr.
richard
sauber
--yes.
mr.
richard
sauber
absolutely.
mr.
richard
sauber
a
pattern,
yes.
that
i
think
we
can
agree
on.
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision,
which
on
the
second
issue
i
think
is
why
we're,
said,
if
it
decided
to
accept
an
injury
and
pattern
discovery
rule,
then
the
complaint
was
timely.
by
deciding
only
on
an
injury
discovery
rule,
then
the
complaint
was
not
timely,
and
the
only
thing
that
you
can
take
from
that
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
pattern
alleged
in
the
complaint
was
not
evident
to
her
until
december
of
1990.
mr.
richard
sauber
after
her
injury
occurred.
mr.
richard
sauber
there
are...
justice
kennedy,
there
are
a
number
of
predicate
acts
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
first
injury
from
several
predicate
acts
is
only
to
her.
in
december
of
1990,
when
she
discovers
that
the
same
scheme
was
designed
to
defraud
others,
it
occurs
to
her
at
that
point
that
there
is
a
pattern.
that
is
her--
mr.
richard
sauber
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
richard
sauber
--i'm--
mr.
richard
sauber
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
sauber
no,
but
i
do
think
that
it
was...
it's
only
fair
to
suggest
that
she
would
have
a
difficult
time
proving
continuity
and
relationship
and
threat
of
continued
activity
if
it
was
just
a
dispute
between
her
and
her
husband.
mr.
richard
sauber
well--
mr.
richard
sauber
--well,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
under
no
circumstances
could
a
single
scheme
with
multiple
predicate
acts
constitute
a
pattern.
that's
what
you
decided
in
h.j.--
what
we
are
saying
is
that
in
this
case
the
individual
predicate
acts
only
resulting
in
injury
to
her
did
not
constitute
a
pattern,
and
if
i--
mr.
richard
sauber
--because
there
was
only
one
victim.
mr.
richard
sauber
i
understand.
that
is
not
dispositive,
but
there
was
one
victim
for
a
short
period
of
time,
and
basically
what
it
was
was
a
dispute
growing
out
of
a
divorce
case
in
which
the
husband
tried
to
get
out
of
his
obligations.
mr.
richard
sauber
well,
i--
mr.
richard
sauber
--but
i
think
in
fairness
the
way
that
this
court
has
defined
pattern
and
required
the
plaintiff
to
find
some
sort
of
continuity
and
a
relationship,
and
the
threat
of
continued
criminal
activity,
in
the
short
period
of
time
when
she
recognizes
that
her
husband
has
tried
to
defraud
her
out
of
her
debt,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
is
not
sufficient
for
her
to
conclude,
even
if
she's
omniscient,
that
there
is
in
fact
a
pattern.
mr.
richard
sauber
i
think--
mr.
richard
sauber
--well--
mr.
richard
sauber
--well,
i
think
that
it's
the
issue
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
h.j.,
that
the...
a
single
scheme,
even
if
there
are
a
number
of
predicate
acts
within
a
short
period
of
time,
where
really
in
essence
it's
a
dispute
between
a
husband
and
wife,
doesn't
constitute
the
kind
of
continued
criminal
activity
that
this
court
contemplated
when
it
defined
a
pattern.
mr.
richard
sauber
i
think
in
a
common
sense
approach
most
plaintiffs
and
practitioners
would
start
to
think
of
a
pattern
when
you
have
different
and
multiple
victims
of
the
same--
mr.
richard
sauber
--yes.
mr.
richard
sauber
the
facts,
i
think,
simply
stated
are
that
the
attempted
fraudulent
transfer
and
the
reorganization
of
the
medical
practice
was
designed
to
defraud
joanne,
the
wife,
and
one
of
the
partners,
and
some
of
the
junior
shareholders,
so
the
answer
is
yes,
there
were
three
intended
victims
of
the
same
pattern
of
using
the
medical
practice
as
an
enterprise.
mr.
richard
sauber
it
was
a...
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
sauber
well--
mr.
richard
sauber
--there
was--
mr.
richard
sauber
--it
can
establish
a
pattern
if
it
goes...
if
it
goes
on
and
on
and
if
there's
a
threat...
well,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
what
happened
is,
at
a
point
only
a
year
after...
in
may
of
'89
she
finds
out
about
the
fraudulent
transfer.
a
year
later,
in
december
of
1990,
she
finds
out
that
there
are
other
victims
of
the
fraud.
in
some
circuits
that
would
not
be
enough
time
to
allege
a
pattern.
in
some
circuits
the
requirement
is
that
the
activity
needs
to
go
on
for
2
years.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my...
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
sauber
i
want
to
make
three
points
quickly.
number
1,
joanne
still
has
not
received
her
$1.4
million
that
was
the
debt
when
vincent
went
into
bankruptcy.
some
of
that
money
went
to
the
trustee,
others
of
it
went
to
the
estate.
she's
still
not
received
her
full
amount.
in
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question
about
judge
hall's
opinion,
it's
clear
that
judge
hall
agreed
with
our
rendition
of
what
the
pattern
was
because
she
decided
in
her
opinion
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
decided
that
the
injury-and-pattern
discovery
rule
was
applicable,
the
cause
of
action
in
this
case
would
be
timely.
mr.
richard
sauber
yes,
but
i
think
in
choosing
between
those
two
rules
the
ninth...
judge
hall
and
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
decided
that
had
they
gone
the
other
way
and
chosen
the
injury-and-pattern
discovery
rule,
her
complaint
would
have
been
timely,
and
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
when
the
second
pattern
occurred.
our
argument
is
when
a
plaintiff
can
reasonably
be
said
to
be
on
notice
that
a
pattern
has
occurred,
which
is
one
of
the
key
elements
and
one
of
the
unique
elements
of
this
statute.
in
answer,
justice
scalia,
to
your
question
and
justice
breyer's
question,
an
injury
discovery
rule
with
a
racketeering
statute
is
completely
unworkable
for
this
reason.
a
plaintiff
may
be
injured
by
the
first
predicate
act.
at
that
point
she
is
now
on
notice,
inquiry
notice,
and
yet
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
exist.
so
now
instead
of
being
diligent--
mr.
richard
sauber
--yes.
mr.
richard
sauber
i'm
sorry,
say
that
again.
mr.
richard
sauber
no,
i'm
not
assuming
that
at
all,
and
let
me
explain.
if...
it
really
is
a
question
of
adopting
an
injury
discovery
rule
that
is
completely
unworkable,
and
that's
our
point.
mr.
richard
sauber
right,
and
if
you
take
the
fact
that
the
first
predicate
act
is
the
discovery
that
you've
been
injured
by
the
first
predicate
act,
and
the
pattern
or
the
other
predicate
acts
come
later,
you've
in
essence
created
two
classes
of
plaintiffs.
mr.
richard
sauber
absolutely.
that...
i'm
not
assuming
that,
but
that
is
the
problem
with
the
injury
discovery
rule.
mr.
richard
sauber
he's
arguing
for
an
injury
rule
which
in
our
view
is
completely
inappropriate
to
the
racketeering
statute,
which
has
as
many
of
the
predicate
acts
fraud
claims,
which
this
court
has
already
decided
in
holmberg
v.
yonquist
means
that
in
a
fraud
claim
you
must
be
able
to
discover
the
fraud
before
the
statute
of
limitations
starts
running.
when
you
lay
on
top
of
that
a
requirement
to
discover
and
plead
a
pattern,
and
all
of
the
difficulties
and
the
intricacies
in
both
defining
and
finding
a
pattern,
you
really
have
created
a
cause
of
action
which
by
its
nature
is
a
fraud
case,
by
its
nature
is
a
case
that
has
as
some
of
its
elements
concealment
and
continuity,
and
it
seems
unfair
to
say
that
the
statute
of
limitations,
when
you're
required
to
plead
all
of
those
elements,
starts
to
tick
before--
