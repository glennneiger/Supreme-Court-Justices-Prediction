v.
patricia
brown.
mr.
sauber.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
preliminary
discharge
is
one
that...
could
you
explain
that
just
very
briefly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
the
discharge
was
obtained
by
fraud?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
banker's
trust,
you're
referring
to
the
second
circuit
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
bankruptcy
fraud,
you
mean
something
different,
mr.
sauber,
i
take
it,
than
the
fraudulent
conveyance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
you
can
answer
it
yes
or
no.
either
you
do
mean
something
different
or
you
don't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
still
don't
understand,
is
there
a
separate
claim
somewhere
that
the...
he
conveyed
property,
perhaps
the
medical
practice,
to
third
parties
in
fraud
of
creditors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
bankruptcy,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
pattern,
but
as
i
understand
it
it
is
simply
a
conveyance,
was
it
not,
of
property
for
less
than
fair
value?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
that's
one
act.
i
mean,
what
more
happened?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sauber.
mr.
lacovara.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

is
an
adversary
complaint
in

--and
what,
strictly
speaking,
is
an
adversary
complaint
in
the
bankruptcy--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
seeking
some
sort
of
remedy
against
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
you're
reading
from
is
the
adversary
complaint
in
bankruptcy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
complaint
in
the
present
action.
