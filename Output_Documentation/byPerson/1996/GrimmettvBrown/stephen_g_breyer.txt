justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
does
that
injury
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy?
were
there
two
acts
in
this?
i
thought
what
you're
claiming
in
that
complaint
is
there
is
a
person,
and
he
owes
some
money
to
joanne,
and
she
has
a
secured
interest
in
some
property,
and
he
figures
out
a
way
that
he
can
get
rid
of
that
secured
interest
because
what
he's
going
to
do
is
go
through
bankruptcy
and
the
secured
interest
will
disappear.
that's
the
whole
thing.
now,
if
that's
the
whole
thing
i
don't
even
see
that
there
are
two
acts.
where
is
there
a
rico
case
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
much
less
the...
the
other
part
of
that
is
how
is
the
trustee
hurt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
all
is
the
same
thing,
isn't
it?
it
all
is
the
same
thing.
what
he
did
is,
he
went
through
bankruptcy
and
he
wasn't
entitled
to.
i
mean,
i
take
it
if
i
have
a
fraudulent
scheme
to
get
$100,000
from
the
bank,
that
might
hurt
the
bank,
that
might
hurt
some
depositors,
that
might
hurt
some
shareholders.
how
is
it
two
actions,
and
how
is
the
trustee...
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
how
is
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
hurt
by
this
rico
proceeding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
answer...
sorry.
could
you...
i
was...
i...
what
was
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question?
i
never
got
one.
how
much
money
did
the
trustee
lose
as
a
result
of
this
scheme?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
much
does
it
owe?
no,
not
to
joanne.
how
much
money
has
the
trustee
lost
as
a
result
of
the
scheme
that
you
say
involved
a
fraudulent
transfer
of
property?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
have...
i
think
i
agree
with
you,
but
if
i
have
a
very
complicated
scheme
to
sell
you
the
brooklyn
bridge...
you'd
be
too
wise.
you
wouldn't
buy
it,
but
there
are
five
or
six
others
who
might
buy
it.
now,
suppose
instead
of
one
person
buying
it
it
turns
out
five
are
putting
up
the
money.
is
there
suddenly
a
rico
violation?
i
mean,
is
there
a
rico
violation
because
the
same
activity
hurt
five
people
rather
than
just
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
that
create
a
pattern?
i
don't
understand
pattern
here,
in
other
words,
which
is
what's
causing
me
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
why
seven
complicated
acts
which
lead
to
the
sale
of
the
brooklyn
bridge
comprise
two
predicates,
and
i
don't
understand,
if
they
don't,
why
the
fact
that
three
people
buy
the
brooklyn
bridge
rather
than
one
makes
a
difference
for
rico
purposes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
sell
the
bridge
here
twice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
170
pages,
despite
its
detail,
a
complaint
longer
than
any
antitrust
complaint
i've
seen,
including
the
most
complex,
i
still
couldn't
find
in
this
detail
what
the
facts
were.
that
is,
what
are
the
facts
that
lead
to
the
sale
of
the
brooklyn
bridge
twice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
a
fraudulent
concealment?
is
there
fraudulent--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
rule
would
be
4
years
from
the
time
of
discovery
or
from
the
commission
of
the
second
predicate
act,
whichever
occurs
the
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
didn't
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
didn't
say
discovery.
i
said
the
rule
would
be,
i
take
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
would
be
4
years
from
the
injury,
right,
or
the
commission
of
the
second
predicate
act,
whichever
occurs
the
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
the
need
for
that.
that
is
to
say,
why
couldn't
a
person
who
burns
down
somebody's
house
as
part
of
a
plan
to
burn
down
three
people's
houses,
which
occur
5
years
later,
why
couldn't
the
person
whose
house
is
burned
down
to
begin
with
recover?
i
mean,
it
would
seem
odd
that
congress
wouldn't
want
them
to
recover.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
rule
that
would
allow
that
person
4
years
from
the
time
of
injury,
or
the
time
the
second
house
burns
down,
would
i
think
be
a
just
rule--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
but
from
your
point
of
view
dismissal
is
improvidently
granted
because
we
couldn't
pick
which
of
the
three
is
something
that
you
have
no
objection
to,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
we
add
a
version
to
that,
that
discovery
or
the
second
thing
occurs,
whichever
comes
later.
