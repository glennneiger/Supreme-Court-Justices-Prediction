well,
does
it
follow...
may
i
just
be
sure
to
get
one
little...
does
it
follow
as
night
follows
the
day
if
she's
the
only
beneficiary,
and
if
she's
not
been
injured,
then
neither
has
the
trustee
been
injured?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
do
go
ahead
and
decide
it,
which
of
the
three
do
you
think
is
the
best?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
hasn't
been
clear
for
80
years
because
section
4
wasn't
enacted
till
the
1950's.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
of
limitations
part
of
it
wasn't
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
were
all
construing
state
statutes
of
limitations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
interrupt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
assuming
the
answer
to
something
your
opponent
thinks
we
need
not
decide.
you're
assuming
that
a
person
can't
have
a
rico
cause
of
action
based
on
an
injury
before
the
statute
was
violated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
assuming
that
a
plaintiff
may
have
a
rico
cause
of
action
based
on
an
injury
that
occurred
before
the
statute
was
violated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
you're
still
saying...
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
you're
assuming
you
can
have
a
rico
cause
of
action
before
the
violation
occurs.
