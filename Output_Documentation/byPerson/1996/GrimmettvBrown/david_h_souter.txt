well
then,
why
couldn't
there
be
a
pattern
inferred
from
the
multiple
predicate
acts
before
the
second
victim
even
entered
the
picture?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
there
is
such
a
pattern,
and
i
thought
your
answer
a
moment
ago
was
that
there
was,
then
i
would
suppose
that
so
far
as
the
pattern
requirement
for
your
cause
of
action
it
was
satisfied
before
anything
was
done
to
damage
the
medical
partner.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
go
back
and
say
what
i
thought
you
did
not
say
before,
and
that
is,
justice
o'connor,
your
suggestion
is
not
well-taken.
there
was
no
pattern,
and
there
was
no
pattern
until
the
second
victim
came
into
the
picture,
but
that's
not
what
you
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
think
you've
got
to
choose
what
your
pattern
view
is,
because
if
you
accept
justice
o'connor's
suggestion
and
my
suggestion,
i
guess,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
out,
even
on
the
more
favorable
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
dispositive,
we
agree.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
this
seems
to
boil
down
to
is
what
justice
o'connor
was
suggesting
a
moment
ago.
she
simply
didn't
recognize
it
fast
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
that
it
happened
in
a
short
time.
it
just
grew
out
of
this
domestic
dispute.
if
the
pattern
is
there,
it
seems
to
me
the
law
is...
has
got
to
require
the
plaintiff
to
be
nimble
enough
to
see
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying,
i
think,
in
answer
to
justice
breyer
it's
when
they
sell
the
bridge
twice,
not
when
they
sell
it
once
to
five
people.
that's
when
it
becomes
clear.
is
that
it?
