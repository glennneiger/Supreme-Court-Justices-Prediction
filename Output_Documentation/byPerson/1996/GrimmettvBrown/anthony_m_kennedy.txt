can
you
tell
me,
what
is
the
first
predicate
act
under
rico
and
what
is
the
second,
and
what
was
the
date
of
each?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
later
predicate
acts?
does
that
suffice
for
a
rico
violation,
or
do
we
need
a
second
predicate
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
did
that
occur?
you
say
there
cannot
be
a
pattern
without
a
second
victim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
was
that
not
until
after
the
injury
had
occurred?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
just
take
it
at
that
point.
i
had
a
problem
with
your
brief,
because
you
were
saying,
we
have
a
terrible
problem
here.
we
had
the
first
predicate
act,
and
then
the
injury,
and
then
the
second
predicate
act.
well,
i
kept
asking
myself,
where
is
there
a
rico
injury
at
all
if
there's
no
second
predicate
act
at
the
time
the
injury
occurs?
