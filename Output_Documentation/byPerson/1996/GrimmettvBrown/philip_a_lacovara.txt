mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
order
to
understand
why
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
dismissed
this
claim
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
it
may
be
important
both
to
mention
the
four
possible
statute
of
limitations
rules
that
the
briefs
frame,
under
three
of
which
i
think
the
colloquy
with
my
learned
friend
would
show
this
judgment
must
be
affirmed,
but
it's
also
important
to
go
back
and
find
out
what
this
case
is
actually
about
as
it
was
pled
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
court,
it
seems
to
be
transformed
into
a
lost
debt
bankruptcy
case.
that
is
emphatically
not
the
reason
alleged
in
the
district
court
or,
indeed,
in
the
bankruptcy
court
in
1989
that
led
to
the
claim
that
the
petitioner,
ms.
siragusa,
had
actually
incurred
substantial
and
measurable
injury
as
of
1987.
let
me
refer
if
i
may
to
the
joint
appendix.
let's
start
first
with
the
bankruptcy...
with
the
adversary
complaint,
because
that
is
the
date...
that's
may
1989...
by
which
time
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
she
had
adequate
notice
of
any
rico
claim.
may
1989,
more
than
4
years
before
she
filed
the
bankruptcy...
the
rico
case.
although
there's
been
some
discussion
here
denying
the
existence
of
a
pattern,
or
suggesting
there
may
have
been
only
one
or
two
predicate
acts,
in
may
of
1989
ms.
siragusa
filed
the
adversary
complaint
that
among
other
things
lists--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--in
the
bankruptcy
court,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it's
in
effect
a
civil
claim
that
is
in
some
way
related
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
it's
a
claim
that
may
be
made
either
by
the
trustee
against
a
third
party,
or
it
may
be
made
by
an
outsider
against
the
debtor
and
some
third
parties.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
can
also
be,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
request
for
a
personal
remedy
against
individuals
and,
indeed,
the
individuals
in
the
bankruptcy
case
included
the
very
respondents
before
the
court
today,
the
lawyer
defendants.
in
may
of
1989
ms.
siragusa
claimed
that
there
had
been
what
she
called
a
fraudulent
course
of
conduct,
and
if
you
look
on
page...
beginning
on
page
191
of
the
joint
appendix,
beginning
on
paragraph
21,
she
then
uses
this
as
a
defined
term.
the
debtor,
beginning
in
1983,
never
intended
to
make
marital
payments
but
undertook
a
fraudulent
and
deceptive
course
of
conduct...
that
paragraph
continues
on...
in
which
the
other
defendants
ultimately
joined.
she
then
goes
on,
just
to
refer
to
justice
kennedy
and
justice
breyer's
question--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--filed
in
may
1989.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no.
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
moment,
mr.
chief
justice.
she
then
goes
on,
beginning
in
paragraph
33,
to
allege,
beginning
in
at
least
19...
july
1987,
approximately
2
years
before
this
complaint
was
filed,
a
series
of
fraudulent
misstatements
by
mail
and
wire
made
by
vincent
and
made,
she
alleges,
by
the
counsel
for
the
heart
institute
entities.
that's
patricia
brown,
the
respondent,
and
ultimately
the
firm
with
which
she
was
affiliated,
the
beckley
singleton
firm.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
paragraph
33,
and
then
if
you
continue
on
to
subparagraph
b--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--c,
d.
you'll
see
references
to
the
heart
institute's
counsel
saying
this,
that
and
the
next
thing.
then
go
over
to
page
198
in
the
joint
appendix.
she
then
says
the
debtor
filed
certain
schedules
in
january
1988
taking
an
unbelievable
position.
she
attributes
that
to
the
heart
institute
counsel.
that's
respondent
patricia
brown.
she
says
in
paragraph
i
on
99
that
the
schedules
prepared
by
the
respondent
purportedly
described
certain
transactions--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--the
point
is
that
the...
there
are
several
points,
justice
o'connor.
the
key
point
is
there
was
a
pattern
that
existed
as
of
this
point,
because
she
has
alleged
by
this
time
several
years
of
allegedly
fraudulent
activity,
wire
fraud,
mail
fraud,
and
fraudulent
bankruptcy
petition.
the
bankruptcy
petition
had
been
filed
in
1987.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
and
that's
the
next
point
to
get
to.
she
alleges
in
that
complaint
that
she
was
specifically
injured
and
incurred
financial
damage
as
a
result
of
the
scheme.
now,
the
scheme
that
she
alleges
there...
and
this
is
important
as
well...
is
exactly
the
same
scheme
as
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
understood
that
she
alleged
in
the
rico
case.
it
was
not
the
fraudulent
discharge
of
the
debt.
she
alleged
in
the
bankruptcy
complaint
in
1989
exactly
what
she
alleged
in
the
rico
complaint
in
november
1993,
that
the
object
of
the
scheme
and
the
nature
of
the
injury
was
the
fraudulent
transfer
out
from
under
her
security
interest
of
her
husband's
interest
in
the
medical
practice.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
judge
hall
left
open
the
question
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
would
prevail
under
the
injury-plus-pattern
recognition
point.
our
argument
today,
however,
is
as
the
colloquy
with
several
of
the
justices
has
indicated,
even
under
that
rule...
that's
the
third
of
the
fourth
that
the
briefs
frame...
this
case
had
to
be
dismissed,
because
petitioner--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that's
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct,
but
i
do
want
to
say--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--well,
i
can
only
speak
as
the
respondent.
we
opposed
certiorari,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
can
say
that
the
court
appears
to
have
taken
certiorari
to
decide,
in
the
existence
of
a
real
conflict,
what
the
correct
accrual
rule
is
in
civil
rico
claims.
there
are
three
rules
that
we
think
clearly
bar
this
complaint.
the
fourth
one,
only
the
fourth
one...
that's
the
third
circuit's
last
predicate
act
rule...
is
the
only
one
that
would
save
it.
the
one
that
we
think,
as
even
the
petitioner
in
her
brief
seems
to
recognize,
would
clearly
command
affirmance
here,
and
we
think
is
the
correct
rule,
is
the
pure
clayton
act
accrual
rule.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
in...
up
through
the
ninth
circuit,
since
ninth
circuit
law
was
quite
clear,
it
was
sufficient
to
argue
that
petitioner's
rico
complaint
was
barred
by
the
ninth
circuit's
injury
discovery
principle,
but
now
in
this
court
i
take
it
that
the
issue
before
you
is,
what
is
the
right
rule
to
lay
down
for
all
civil
rico
claims
whether
or
not
it's
the
one
that
was
adopted--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--well,
i
think
the
way
the
injury
rule
has
been
defined,
it's
either
an
actual
or
imputed
or
constructive
injury.
the
first
rule...
and
i
don't
want
this
to
get
lost
in
the
discussion.
the
first
rule
and
the
one
that
we
think
is
correct
is
the
clayton
act
accrual
rule
which
petitioner
acknowledges
has
no
injury...
has
no
knowledge
or
discovery
element.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
exactly,
or
even
actual
knowledge.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
justice
o'connor,
but
that
was
an
argument
that
was
specifically
rejected,
or
the
implication
of
that
argument
was
specifically
rejected
in
agency
holding
v.
malley-duff,
in
which
the
court
said
the
proper
statute
of
limitations
for
civil
rico
cases
is
not
the
fraud
statute,
even
if
it
happens
to
be
a
fraud
predicate
that's
invoked
in
a
particular
case.
congress,
when
it
fashioned
the
civil
rico
section,
specifically
borrowed
the
pattern
from
the...
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
and
the
court
held
therefore
we
will
borrow
the
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
that
should
make
this
an
easy
case
to
dispose
of
is
that
it's
been
settled
since
1919,
including
by
this
court
in
zenith
v.
hazeltine,
as
the
petitioner
acknowledges
in
her
brief,
that
the...
there
is
no
discovery
principle
at
all
under
clayton
act
section
4
civil
damage
cases.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
a
tolling
doctrine.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
and
we
concede
that
under
any
principle
of
accrual
there
will
be
a
tolling
if
there's
been
active
concealment
designed
to
mislead
the
potential
claimant
into
believing
that
she
has
no
claim.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
don't
think
that
that's
necessarily
a
necessary
assumption
in
the
statute.
what
congress
has
done
is
to
say,
it
may
be
possible
to
look
to
predicate
acts
taking
place
as
far
apart
as
over
a
10-year
period
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
pattern
of
racketeering.
but
in
the
h.j.
case,
in
which
the
court
unanimously
agreed
that
all
the
pattern
requirement
requires
is
some
relationship
between
or
among
the
predicate
acts
and
the
threat
of
continuing
criminal
activity,
it
is
unlikely
that
a
predicate
act
in
year
one
and
a
predicate
act
in
year
10
would
show
a
sufficient
continuity
to
give
rise
to
a
pattern.
but
the
point
is,
justice
scalia,
that
only
relates
to
whether
or
not
a
civil
rico
claim
arises.
i
don't
think
it
really
has
any
bearing
on
when
the
claim
should
be
viewed
as
accruing
for
purposes
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
that's
conceivable.
i
would
not
suggest
that
on
this
ground
a
disposition
that
applies
what
we
consider
the
correct
rule,
which
is
the
clayton
act
no
discovery
principle,
or
even
the
ninth
circuit's
discovery
of
injury
principle,
would
be
academic
or
moot,
even
though
the
plaintiff...
the
petitioner
would
also
lose
under
the
pattern
discovery
principle
because
she
knew
as
of
may
1989
that
there
had
been,
according
to
her
allegations,
yearsworth
of
mail
frauds,
wire
frauds
leading
up
to
the
fraudulent--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that's
a
debatable
question.
i
think
justice
breyer
raised
that
question,
whether
the
injury
must
take
place
after
the
pattern.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
would
think--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that
issue
isn't
squarely
framed
here,
because
she...
the
injury
that
she
alleges,
and
i
would
like
to
cite
to
the
passages
where
she
describes
her
injuries
as
of
1989,
indeed,
1987,
but
i
think
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute,
justice
scalia,
would
be
that
for
any
rico
claim
to
accrue
there
must
have
been
a
pattern
of
racketeering
and
then
injury
from
a
predicate
act
that
occurred,
otherwise
it
would
be
hard
to
reconcile
the
language
of--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--i
would
not
agree
with
the--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--discovery
point.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
under
one
of
the
rules.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
sorry.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no.
i
think
under
the
discussion
i
was
having
with
justice
scalia
there
would
not
be
a
rico
injury
unless
there
had
been
a
rico
pattern.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--there
is
something--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--there
is
something
to
be
said
for
that,
but
it
may
not
be
the
way
congress
defined
the
statute,
because
at
the
time
of
the
injury
to
the
first
person,
there
was
the
injury
as
a
result
of
an
arson
but
not
necessarily
the
result
of
rico,
because
there
may
not
yet
have
been
a--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we're
in
an
odd
position,
justice
o'connor.
for
the
last
8
or
9
years
the
petitioner
has
been
working
through
several
different
court
systems
claiming
that
she
was
injured
to
a
very
sizeable
degree
by
virtue
of
the
fraudulent
transfer
of
her
interest
in
the
medical
practice
and
the
violation
of
her
right
to
foreclose
under
her
lien,
and
now,
after
the
complaint
has
been
dismissed
by
federal
courts
and
the
state
court
and
bankruptcy
court
she
says,
oh,
by
the
way,
i
haven't
been
injured
at
all
yet,
so--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--in
fact
the
injury
won't
mature
until
the
bankruptcy
case
is
over,
so
we'll
know
in
the
next
millennium--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--it's
still--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--i'm
sorry.
there
has
been
a
revocation
of
the
discharge.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
so
that--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that's
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
joanne
is
the
only
creditor.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
and
that
is
shown--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--no.
that
is
shown
in
the
record.
attached
to
the
summary...
the
dismissal
and
summary
judgment
papers
in
this
case
was
the
opinion
from
february
1993
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
recommending
the
withdrawal
of
the
reference
over
the
adversary
complaint,
and
it
recites
in
recommending
that
that
complaint
be
dismissed
that
joanne
as
of
that
time...
that
all
of
the
creditors
had
been
paid,
and
joanne
was
the
only
remaining
creditor.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct,
and
the...
again
if
i
may
go
outside
the
record.
this
is
judicially
noticeable...
the
bankruptcy
court
has
dismissed
the
trustee's
claims
on
that
theory,
namely
that
she's
the
only
creditor.
he
cannot
maintain
any
pre-petition
claim
for
fraud
because
the
allegation
is
vincent,
in
whose
shoes
the
trustee
stands,
was
an
active
participant
in
that
fraud,
and
therefore
he
is
barred
from
suing
anybody
else
in
vincent's
stead.
but
if
i
may
just--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
oh,
i'm
perfectly
prepared
to
say
she
was
right
in
1989
for
purposes
of
this
litigation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
she...
i
didn't--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
that
she
filed...
the
civil
rico
complaint,
and
let's
turn
to
that,
she
alleges
as
of
1993
various
kinds
of
losses
and
injuries,
and
these
are
injuries
that
she
said
she
incurred
in
1987
when
the
fraudulent
transfers
defeated
her
security
interest,
her
lien,
which
is
property
under
nevada
law,
and
prevented
her
from
foreclosing
on
the
business
and
realizing
what
she
later
claimed
to
be
$6
million
worth
of
profits
that
she
would
have
been
able
to
earn
if
she'd
been
allowed
to
foreclose
in
1987.
the
other
tangible
injury
that
she
alleged
in
this
complaint,
and
i
refer
you
to
page
47
of
the
joint
appendix
and
to
page
70
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
which
she
itemizes
the
"losses
suffered
in
the
siragusa
medical
practice
interest
scheme.
"
she
says
the
losses
currently
exceeding...
currently
as
of
1993
exceeding
$6
million,
the
failure
to
receive
the
marital
payment,
that's
the
$1.3
million
judgment
that
she
had
obtained
against
vincent
in
september
of
1987,
and
the
impairment
of
her
ability
to
execute
and
foreclose
on
siragusa's
medical
practice
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
fraudulent
transfer
in
1987.
so
as
she
alleged
a
civil
rico
claim
with
a
pattern
of
racketeering,
which
is
detailed,
justice
breyer,
in
five
exhibits
attached
to
this
prolix
complaint,
this
thing
in
which
she
claims
dozens
or
maybe
hundreds
of
acts
of
wire
fraud
and
mail
fraud,
she
said
she
lost
property
in
a
tangible
amount
in
1987--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--we
have
suggested
in
the
respondents'
briefs--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--the
latest
theory
of
the
case
presented
in
this
court
is
that
this
is
really
a
bankruptcy
discharge
case,
not
a
challenge
to
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
not
the
fraudulent
reduction
of
her--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--$1.4
million
verdict.
but
the...
since
the
time
the
original
litigation
began,
as
the
record
shows,
and
we
have
attached
as
an
appendix
to
the
beckley
singleton
respondent's
brief,
the
petitioner
has
received
approximately
$1.9
million
as
the
result
of
the
settlement
with
dr.
bowers,
as
the
result
of
the
redefined
alimony
award
to
replace
the
discharged
marital
payment
and
the
$200,000
or
so
that
vincent
paid
in
1994
when
he
settled
the
case.
now,
petitioner
says
maybe
she's
entitled
to
more
than
that
because
maybe
she
has
a
claim
of
interest.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
say
without
knowing
whether
interest
was
running
on
her
original
$1.3
million
judgment
from
1987,
and
if
so
at
what
rate,
but
it
does
look
as
if
she
has
been
at
least
made
more
than
whole.
but
the
other
point
is--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--the
case
law
so
far
in
the
lower
courts,
and
this
court
has
never
addressed
this,
is
that
the
treble
damage,
the
trebling
takes
place
on
the
damage
award
that
the
jury
renders
and
therefore,
if
the
victim
in
a
financial
case
has
been
made
whole
before
trial,
then
there's
nothing
to
treble,
so
the
trebling
doesn't
arise
in
the
air.
it
only
arises
as
a
calculation
on
a
verdict,
and
so
if
she
has
been
made
whole
the
lower
court
cases
suggest
there
is
no
basis
for
a
rico
trebling.
but
the
other
point
that
i
would
make
about
the
posture
of
the
case
in
this
court,
and
this
is
the
other
basis
for
possibly
treating
it
either
as
moot
or
as
recognizing
that
there
isn't
any
claim,
in
her
opening
brief,
main
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court,
in
order
to
sidestep
the
statute
of
limitations
problems
with
the
injuries
about
which
she
is
complaining
below,
the
injuries
that
took
place
in
1987,
petitioner
argues
that
no
injury
has
occurred
yet,
we
won't
know
until
the
bankruptcy
case
is
closed,
and
we
have
until
the
next
millennium
to
bring
a
rico
case
based
on
this
divorce
case.
she
said
if
vincent
is
eventually
denied
a
discharge
for
any
of
these
reasons,
joanne's
debt
owed
by
vincent
will
survive
in
full
unaffected
by
the
bankruptcy
proceedings,
mainly
the
alleged
bankruptcy
fraud.
quote
from
page
16
and
17,
the
moment
of
injury
is
by
definition
the
final
discharge
of
the
defendant's
legal
obligation
to
pay
the
debt.
the
rico
injury
may
not
occur
unless
or
until
a
discharge
is
granted.
and
my
brother
and
i
agree
that
in
1994
judge
riegle,
the
bankruptcy
judge,
granted
the
stipulation
to
which
vincents
consented
revoking
the
discharge,
so
on
the
basis
of
petitioner's
claim
in
this
court
recharacterizing
this
as
a
bankruptcy
fraud
lost
debt
case,
not
only
isn't
there
an
injury,
there
never
will
be.
in
either
event,
affirmance
or
dismissal
under
rule
46
as
moot
would
seem
to
be
appropriate.
now,
my
brother
said--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--well,
i
do
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
case
is
in
that
perspective
alive
enough
to
decide
which
is
the
right
accrual
rule,
because
conceivably
i
think...
well,
i
would
view
it
as
almost
inconceivable,
but
there
is
at
least
a
theoretical
possibility
that
the
court
might
decide
that
the
third
circuit
is
correct,
in
which
case
the
last
predicate
act
rule
would
have
kept
the
claim
alive
for
civil
rico
purposes,
so
the
court
does
have
the
authority
to
decide
the
issue
on
which
it
granted
cert,
namely
which
of
the
four
rules--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that...
i
think
that's
correct.
that's
why
you'd
have
to--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
certainly
from
the
respondents'
standpoint
we'd
be
happy
with
that
disposition.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
the
right
one,
justice
stevens,
is
the
clayton
act
accrual
rule.
in
malley
duff
the
court
held
that
congress
patterned
the
civil
damage
remedy
of
rico
on
the
clayton
act.
it's
been
clear
for
now
80
years
that
the
clayton
act
rule
does
not
have
any
discovery
principle.
it's
worked
quite
well.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
no,
section
4
dates
back--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--i'm
sorry.
but
the
court
in
zenith
cites
cases,
district
court
cases
going
back
to
1919,
because
there
had
been
a
civil
remedy
from
1914
forward,
section
4
itself,
and--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that's
right,
but
they
all
construed
them
as
running
from
the
time
of
injury
without
regard
to
any
discovery.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
was
saying
that
it
is
arguable
that
there
was
no
rico
violation
or
no
rico
injury--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--until
there
is
a
rico
pattern--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--and
an
injury
following
a
predicate
act.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
at
that
point.
but
in
the
colloquy
with
justice
breyer
i
conceded
that
that's
not
necessarily
the
correct
construction
of
the
statute,
but
it's
certainly
one
that's
academic
here,
because
by
petitioner's
own
pleading
there
were
ample
predicate
acts
well
before
the
fraudulent
transfer
and
the
defeat
of
her
security
interest.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i'll
take
h.j.
it
was
agreed
upon
unanimously.
i
know
justice
scalia
you
had
a
characteristically
pungent
concurrence
that
it's
still
frustrating,
but
nevertheless
you
said
the
court
had
done
the
best
it
could
with
congress'
handiwork.
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
multiple
schemes
are
necessary.
it
certainly
doesn't
mean,
as
justice
souter's
opinion
for
the
court
emphasized,
that
there
have
to
be
multiple
victims.
so
a
whole
lot
of
different
criminal
acts...
mail
fraud,
wire
fraud
and
bankruptcy
fraud
directed
at
defeating
and
injuring
joanne
siragusa's
property
interest
would,
i
think
it's
clear,
constitute
a
pattern
if
ever
there
was
one,
and
what
she
has
been
alleging
for
the
last
7
or
8
or
9
years
was
her
injury
took
place
as
a
result
of
that,
or
the
culmination
of
that
pattern,
even
if
other
acts
continued
that
affected,
may
have
affected
other
persons
such
as
dr.
heeren.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit.
