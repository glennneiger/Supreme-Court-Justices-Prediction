but
the
very
authority
that
you
rely
on,
mr.
sauber,
the
banker's
trust,
says
that
such
a
claim
is
not
ripe,
and
the
bottom
line
of
that
case
was
dismissal,
so
i
was
frankly
surprised
that
you
were
urging
to
preserve
your
case,
that
no
injury
has
yet
occurred.
well,
if
no
injury
has
yet
occurred,
you
have
no
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lacovara,
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
this?
as
i
understood
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
judge
hall's
opinion,
she
said
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
question
here,
and
my
circuit's
position
for
10
years
has
been
injury,
whether
or
not
you
know
it's
a
pattern.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
other
circuits
have
the
injury
plus
pattern.
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
that
rule,
this
complaint
would
be
timely,
but,
she
said,
our
rule
is
injury,
period.
am
i
wrong
in
understanding
that
that's
what
judge
hall
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
something
that
the
ninth
circuit
dealt
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ninth
circuit
said,
our
rule,
in
contrast
to
the
rule
in
other
circuits,
is
simply
injury,
and
it
doesn't
matter
that
you
didn't
know
at
that
point
there
was
any
pattern.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
what
you're
telling
us
now,
it
seems
like
this
isn't
the
right
case
for
us
to
decide
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
the
debate
between
the
parties
was
not
about
the
third
circuit
rule
but
between
the
injury
or
injury-plus-pattern
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
that
point
you
do
tell
us
that
in
this...
this
is
an
academic
case,
because
whether
you
apply
your
rule,
which
is
injury,
or
injury
plus
pattern,
this
complaint
is
untimely,
and
if
we
take
that
view,
then
we
can
say,
well,
we
haven't
got
a
real
case
to
deal
with
any
more,
since
either
rule
would
lead
to
the
same
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
mr.
sauber
said
she's
entitled
to
several
thousand
more
than
that,
and
you're
not
disputing...
that
maybe
right
and
that
may
be
wrong,
but
there's
a
controversy
about
it,
is
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
dismissal
as
improvidently
granted,
if
we
thought
this
was
a
case
squarely
presenting
what
is
the
split
in
the
circuits
between
on
the
one
hand
the
injury
rule,
on
the
other
the
injury-plus-pattern
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
could
assume
that
without...
that
wasn't
what
was
before
her.
she
could
say,
even
if
the
pattern
didn't
exist
until
that
later
date,
still
this
complaint
is
not
timely
because
it's
when
she
knew
or
should
have
known
she
was
injured.
