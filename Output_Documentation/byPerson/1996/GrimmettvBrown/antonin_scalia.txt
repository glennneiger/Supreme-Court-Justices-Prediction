justice

scalia
mr.
sauber,
what's
left
of...
what
injury
has
now
been
incurred?
i
mean,
i
don't...
once
the
bankruptcy...
the
source
of
the
injury
was
the
bankruptcy.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy,
was
it
not?
if
that's
been
undone,
what
injury
is
there
for
anybody
to
complain
about
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
--has
that
occurred?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
she
has
a
cause
of
action
before
that
injury
occurs?
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
no
objection
to
dismissing
this
without
prejudice,
but
i
don't
know
how
it
cannot
be
dismissed
if
there
has
been
no
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can't
tell
whether
the
trustee's
been
injured
either
until
the
end
of
the
bankruptcy,
can
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
was
he
injured
in
may
of
19--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
hurt
their
feelings?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
did
it
transfer
the
assets?
did
it
do
anything?
it
seems
to
me
it
did
nothing
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
the
fraud,
or
by
the
reduction
in
value
of
the
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
he
enter
into
a
settlement,
then,
accepting
less,
if
he's
entitled
to
more?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
paragraph?
i
thought
you
said
33.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lacovara,
what
troubles
me
about
just
applying
the
clayton
act
rule
is
that
the
clayton
act
does
not
have
a
provision
like
rico
which
refers
to
predicate
acts,
the
last
of
which
occurred
within
10
years
after
the
commission
of
a
prior
act
of
racketeering
activity.
i...
there's
some
problem,
it
seems
to
me,
of
reconciling
a
sudden
death
knowledge
of
the...
or
injury
rule
with
the
obvious
expectation
in
this
statute
that
there
would
be
a
long
lapse
of
time
of
10
years
between
predicate
acts
that
are
the
basis
of
the
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
your
proposed
rule,
does
there
have
to
have
been
the
pattern
in
existence
when
the
injury
occurred
in
order
for
the
injury
to
start
the
statute
running?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
otherwise
it's
a
very
strange
statute
you
have,
because
it
allows
you
10
years
between
the...
you
know,
the
two
predicate
acts.
you
could
have
the
first
predicate
act,
the
injury
occurs
immediately,
4
years
go
by,
the
statute
has
run,
and
then
the
second
predicate
act
occurs,
which
is
still
within
10
years
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action
if
it's...
under
rico
at
the
time
of
the
first
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lacovara--
justice
antonin
scalia
--aside
from
the
inconsistency
between
saying,
you
know,
for
9
years
that
she's
injured
and
now
she's
not
injured,
when
was
she
right,
in
those
9
years
or
now?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
now...
now...
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
for...
i
mean,
we
have
an
obligation
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
we
have
a
case
or
controversy
before
us,
or
is
this
case
not
proper
for
us
to
entertain,
is
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
subsequent
events
rendered
those
alleged
damages
nonexistent.
justice
antonin
scalia
notably
the
elimination
of
the
discharge.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we'd
only
have
to
decide
whether
the
fourth
is
not
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
still
leave
the
other
three
rattling
around
out
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
conceded
that
you
would
modify
the
clayton
act
rule
to
some
degree
to
say
that
the
injury
has
to
have
occurred
after
the
second
predicate
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
until--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
depending
on
what
a
pattern
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
rule
your
friend
is
arguing,
by
the
way.
he's
arguing
for
an
injury
rule.
