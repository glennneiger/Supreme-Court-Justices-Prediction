right.
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
the
states
have
to
go
along
with
that?
i
suppose
this
can
get
very
complicated
as
to
which
is
first.
in
the...
number
1,
can
the
bureau
of
prisons
tell
the
states
when
their
sentence
is
going
to
run
in
relation
to
the
federal
sentence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
there
some
control
on
that
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
was,
does
the
bureau
of
prisons
have
discretion
to
say
in
a
particular
case
to
the
state,
we're
going
to
allow
all
the
federal
sentences
to
run
first,
and
then
you
can
do
whatever
you
want,
or,
we're
going
to
require
that
part
of
our
sentence
be
served,
then
part
of
your
sentence
served,
then
the
remaining
part
of
ours,
or
can...
is
there...
does...
is
there
some
supremacy
principle
where
the
federal
government
can
direct
this
if
the
states
object?
