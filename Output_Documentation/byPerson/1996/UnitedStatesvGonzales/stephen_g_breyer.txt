justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
anyway,
most
sentencing
statutes
are
phrased
in
the
passive
voice
or
refer
to
the
defendant.
they
don't
say,
the
judge
shall
do
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i
take
it
your
point
is,
like
all
other
sentencing
statutes
this
is
meant
to
talk
about
the
obligation
of
the
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
this
one
is
phrased
that
way.
but
that
cuts
the
other
way
because
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
talks
about
what
the
court
may
do--
--in
the
active
voice.
--and
then
the
second
part
is
broader.
just
one
at
a
time.
yes...
right.
give
him
a
chance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
it
could
happen
in
this
case
under
state
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
know...
under
a
statute,
how
could
it
happen,
because
the
only
provision
that
poses
an
extra
5
years
mandatory
for
possession
of
a
gun
during
a
crime
of
violence
is
this
very
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
think
that
this
statute
means
when
a
person
is
accused
of
that
crime
through
violence...
let's
say
it's
an
armed
bank
robbery
with
a
gun...
he
gets
10
extra
years
for
the
gun?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
including
the
firearm.
not
may,
but
must,
you
mean?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
understand
that
that
included
the
extra
gun
enhancement
part,
but
it
does.
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
odd
result?
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
if
you
took
concurrently
to
mean
concurrently,
it
would
produce
an
odd
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
true
of
the
federal,
too.
if...
i
mean,
you
could
split
the
federal
trial,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
thought
the
odd
result
was
what
i
said
before,
and
he
explained
no,
that's
not
an
odd
result,
the
same
thing's
true
federally,
and
so
i'm
sort
of
stuck
now.
so
i
asked
you,
what's
the
odd
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't...
isn't
odd
particularly,
because
all
kinds
of
things
can
depend
on
that,
whether...
if
you're...
you
know,
if
the
state
court
convicts
somebody
first,
then
they
have
a
conviction
on
the
record.
when
they
have
a
conviction
on
the
record
their
sentence
is
bumped
up
because
of
the
guidelines,
and
if
that
trial
hasn't
take
place
yet,
it
isn't.
i
mean,
lots
of
things
turn
on
timing.
now,
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
what's
wrong?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
go
back,
please,
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
because
i
didn't
understand
either
what
the
inconsistency
is
supposed
to
be
if
we
assume
that
both
statutes
apply
to
the
state.
i
mean,
assume
that
9...
that...
i
thought
the
question
was,
if
3584(a)
applies
both
to
state
and
federal
sentences,
which
i
agree
with
you,
i
think
it
does,
and
then
if
the
section
before
us
also
applies
to
both
state
and
federal,
as
the
government
but
not
you
argues,
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
that
would
produce
an
inconsistency,
but
i
didn't
understand
the
inconsistency
so
i
thought
i'd
ask
you
so
you
could
explain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
this
circumstance
we'd
simply
have
to
say,
look,
that
committee
report
doesn't
govern
this
circumstance,
that
the
judge
is
perfectly
free
to
let
the
rest
of
the
sentence
run
concurrently
with
the
state,
but
he
isn't
free
to
let
this
part
run
with
the
state
because
this
part
says
it's
supposed
to
run
consecutively
with
any
preceding
sentence.
would
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
just
run
it...
if
he
doesn't
want
to,
say
run
the
920...
run
the
substantive
federal
crime
other
than
the
924(c)
consecutively
with
the
state
crime.
do
that,
and
then
when
they're
finished
that,
run
this
5
years.
that
would
seem...
i
mean,
i'm
looking
for
a
flaw
in
that.
that
would
seem
to
solve
the
problem
that
you
raised.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
supervised
release
would
have
to
take...
they'd
have
to
split
the
supervised
release
from
the
first
part,
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
guess
you
could
do
that.
why
couldn't
you...
would
that
require
a
departure?
i'm
not
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
agree
with
that,
absolutely.
what
you'd
have
to
do
is
the
other
stuff
comes
first,
consecutively,
then
the
5
years,
then
supervised
release
insofar
as
it's
appropriate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
think
that
would
work.
i
can't
think
of
anything
that
stands
in
the
way
of
that,
off-hand.
