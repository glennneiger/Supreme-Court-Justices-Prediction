justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
estrada,
i
can
agree
with
your...
with
the
government's
position
that
the
statute
as
written
does
not
compel
the
states
to
make
their
sentences
nonconcurrent,
but
why
is
it
not
the
case
that,
after
you've
had
the
federal
sentence
imposed
and
then
a
state
sentence
is
imposed
and
the
state
says,
well,
we're
not
bound
by
this
federal
statute,
we
will
have
this
run
concurrently
with
the
federal
sentence,
why
does
not
the
federal
sentence
at
that
point
become
in
violation
of
the
statute,
because
it
is
now
a
sentence
that
is
being
served
concurrently
with
another
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
you
would
say
that
the
state
could...
let's...
it
imposes
its
sentence
first.
the
federal
sentence
comes
up
second,
and
the
sentencing
judge
says,
well,
this
cannot
run
concurrent,
so
it
will
be
consecutive,
and
then
he
goes
back
to
the
state
court
and
says,
in
light
of,
you
know,
what
the
feds
have
done,
please
make
my
state
sentence
run
concurrent
with
the
federal
sentence,
and
the
state
says,
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
state
could
in
effect
frustrate
this
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
state
law
it
would
be
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that.
if
it
said,
nor
shall
a
concurrent
sentence
be
imposed...
it
uses...
almost
goes
out
of
its
way
to
use
different
language.
it
says,
nor
shall
the
term
of
imprisonment
imposed
under
this
subsection
run
concurrently
with
any
other
term
of
imprisonment,
and
so
as
soon
as
the
state
decides
later
to
have
a
concurrent
state
sentence,
this
term,
the
term
imposed
under
this
section,
will
begin
to
run
concurrently
with
the
state
sentence.
i
mean,
literally,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
he
keeps
thinking
of
more
as
we--
[laughter]
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you--
--i
say,
you
keep
thinking
of
more
points
as--
--no,
he
had
a
second
point
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
preceded
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
principle
says
that
you
must
infer
a
subject
for
a
sentence
in
the
passive
voice?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
principle
of
grammar,
or
something?
if
it's
in
the
passive
voice
it
simply
means
the
term
of
imprisonment
imposed
shall
not
run
concurrently.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
a
subject
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
here
is
really
being
generous
to
the
defendant.
even
if
you
conceded
the
point
that
justice
stevens
and
i
have
been
pressing,
you
would
not
have
to
concede
the
point
that
therefore
the
statute
does...
therefore
the
statute
does
not
take
into
account
state
sentences.
all
you
would
have
to
concede
is
that
the
federal...
or
that
the
statute
controls
state
courts.
all
you
would
have
to
concede
is
that
the
statute
continues
to
control
only
federal
sentencing,
but
when
the
federal
sentencing
has
been
made
by
a
state
courts
action
to
run
concurrently
with
the
state
sentence,
the
federal
sentence
must
be
altered
to
be...
you
know,
to
run
sequentially,
or,
in
other
words,
the
sentence
that's
imposed
has
to
be
conditional.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
estrada,
is...
before
you...
is
consecutivity
a
word?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bustamante,
what
is
your
response
to
mr.
estrada's
point
about
3584(a)?
i
mean,
i
understand
that
your
only
concern
is
your
client,
but
if
we
agree
with
you
in
this
case
with
regard
to
defendants
in
general
we
would
be
doing
them
more
harm
than
good,
because
if
this
provision
doesn't
apply
to
state
sentences,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
distinguish
3584(a),
which
also
would
not
apply
to
state
sentences,
which
would
mean
that
a
federal
court
could
not
make
a
federal
sentence
concurrent
with
a
state
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
just
lost
me.
do
you
have
anything
about
the
text
that
would
distinguish
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
government
would
not
take
that
discretion
away
from
state
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
that
this
does
not...
i
didn't
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--shall
not
run
concurrent
to
any
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
another
way
to
eliminate
all
the
chance,
and
the
government
generously
has
not
asserted
this,
but
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
interpret
this
to
speak
only
of
the
federal
courts,
but
to
allow
the
federal...
to
require
the
federal
sentences
to
be
made
consecutive
whenever
a
state
court
says
that
the
state
sentence
shall
run
concurrently.
and
i
guess
you
could
have
games
being
played
back
and
forth,
and
the
state
court
revises
its
sentence
and
the
federal
court
revises
its
sentence,
but
you
could
eliminate
all
of
that
inconsistency
by
simply
saying
if
a
state
court
after
the
federal
sentence
imposes
a
concurrent
state
sentence,
the
federal
sentence,
pursuant
to
the
precise
language
of
this,
the
term
of
imprisonment
imposed
shall
not
run
concurrently
with
that
state
sentence,
so
it
thereupon
becomes
consecutive.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
want
that.

of
the
government's
reply
brief,
footnote
2.
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
fact
that
it's
much
more
specific
is
what
is
hurting
you
here,
because
i
think
you
may
be
right
that
there
is
an
incompatibility
between
3584(a)
and
the
section
at
issue
here.
3584(a)
says
that
the
terms
may
run
concurrently
or
consecutively,
and
924(c)
says
that
they
may
not
run
concurrently,
that
they
must
run
consecutively.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
an
inconsistency
but,
as
you
say,
the
more
specific
statute
is
924(c)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
rule
is
you
apply
the
more
specific
one,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
can
argue
that
this
must
apply
only
to
federal
sentences
and
not
to
state
sentences
somehow
on
the
basis
that
there
would
otherwise
be
inconsistency
between
those
two.
there's...
and
in
fact,
there's
going
to
be
inconsistency
whether
you
apply
it
federal
or
state,
isn't
there?
i
mean,
that's
a
xx--
justice
antonin
scalia
--section
5...
i...
what's
the
section
5
you're
referring
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
sentence
5.
i
thought
you
said
section
5.
justice
antonin
scalia
gotcha.
