mr.
estrada,
do
you
know
of
any
federal
criminal
sentencing
statute
that
controls
state
courts
without
saying
so?
to
affect
the
state's
criminal
process
one
would
expect
congress
at
least
to
speak
with
a
clear
voice
that
it
is
attempting
to
control
what
the
state
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
that
what
you
could
do
here?
isn't
that
your
remedy,
then?
as
you
say,
mr.
estrada
has
said
this
is
a
rule
of
sentencing
for
federal
judges
only,
and
he
recognized
that
if
the
order
had
come
up
with
the
state
court
second
the
state
court
could
do
what
it
will.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
preempt
state
law,
because
you
just,
i
think,
recognized
that
you
could
go
back
to
state
court
and
say,
based
on
something
that
happened
after,
and
based
on
the
way
the
government,
u.s.
government
reads
this
statute,
the
ball
ends
up
in
your
court,
state,
and
your
law
isn't
being
preempted.
you
favor
concurrency,
so
reduce
the
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
the
position
that
mr.
estrada
says
that
the
government...
that's
not
how
the
government
is
reading
this
federal
statute,
so
maybe
you're...
you've
come
to
the
wrong
court
for
the
remedy
you're
seeking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
that
differ
from
3146(b)(2),
in...
the
bail-jumping
statute
says
shall
be
consecutive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
guideline
didn't
take
that
position
it
wouldn't
matter,
because
the
statute
says
shall
be
consecutive.
the
guideline
couldn't
take
a
position
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
