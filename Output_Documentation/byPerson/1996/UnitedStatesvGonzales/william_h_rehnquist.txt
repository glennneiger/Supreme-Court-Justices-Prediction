we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1605,
united
states
v.
miguel
gonzalez.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
bustamante.
am
i
pronouncing
your
last
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bustamante.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bustamante,
the
tenth
circuit
in
its
opinion
relied
on
the
case
of
the
church
of
holy
trinity
v.
the
united
states,
which
to
me
has
always
meant
we're
going
to
legislate
a
little.
it
means
that
you
can't
really
get
the
meaning
you
want
out
of
the
statute.
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
went
that
far
here,
or
do
you
think
its
interpretation
is
absolutely
defensible
just
as
the
statute
is
written?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
really
is
quite
consistent
with
the
government's
oral
presentation
here,
that
the
section
speaks
to
federal
sentencing
judges
and
federal
proceedings.
it
doesn't
purport
to
speak
to
state
court
judges.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
3584(a),
which
you...
that's
the
one
you
just
referred
to,
i
believe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that
set
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that
set
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
38...
3584(a),
which
you're...
says
a
sentence
may
be
made
to
run
either
concurrently
or
consecutively,
and
then
924(c)
says
that
in
certain
circumstances
it
shall
not
be
made
to
run
concurrently,
so
you
can
construe
those
sections
consistently,
can
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
rule
says...
and
i
take
it
3854,
whatever
the
30
one
is,
is
a
general
principle
of
sentencing.
it
can
run
either
concurrently
or
consecutively.
then
you
have
a
far
more
specific
one
in
section
924.
it
says,
shall
not
run
concurrently.
i
don't
see
how
there's
necessarily
any
inconsistency
between
those.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bustamante.
mr.
estrada,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
