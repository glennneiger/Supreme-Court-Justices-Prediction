mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
924(c)(1)
of
title
18
provides
for
mandatory
jail
sentences
for
persons
who
use
or
carry
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
certain
offenses.
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case
held
that
a
sentence
imposed
under
section
924(c)
by
a
federal
district
court
may
be
made
to
run
concurrently
with
a
state
sentence
that
the
defendant
is
already
serving.
in
our
view,
that
is
wrong
for
three
reasons.
first
and
foremost,
the
language
of
the
statute
expressly
forbids
the
imposition
of
a
concurrent
sentence.
second,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
to
imply
a
presumption
that
that
prohibition
refers
solely
to
previously
imposed
federal
sentences,
and
finally,
we
think
the
tenth
circuit
was
wrong
to
rely
on
a
passage
from
the
1984
senate
committee
report
that
accompanied
the
1984
amendments
to
section
924(c).
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
justice
o'connor,
but
let
me
back
up.
under
the
sentencing
statutes
that
we
have,
how
the
sentence
is
administered
is
usually
up
to
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
and
in
many
circumstances
it
will
not
be
able
to
be
first.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
in
this
case,
for
example,
in
order
to
give
effect
to
both
the
statutory
authority
to
make
the
drug
sentences
concurrent
with
the
state
terms
and
to
the
statutory
mandate
that
the
924
sentence
be
consecutive,
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
have
to
run
the
federal
drug
sentence
first,
concurrent
with
the
state
sentence,
and
to
run
the
924(c)
sentence
last,
consecutive
to
both
state
and
federal
sentences.
there
was
an
assumption
in
the
court
of
appeals
view
that
that
would
not
be
so
because
it
gave
what
we
think
was
inordinate
weight
to
its
view
of
the
senate
committee
report,
but
that
is,
in
fact,
an
error.
as
a
matter
of
the
administration
of
the
sentence,
under
section
3584(c),
i
believe,
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
treat
the
entire
term
imposed
by
the
federal
court
as
a
single
administrative
term
that
has
several
parts,
and
the
part
that
would
correspond
to
the
federal
drug
sentences
in
this
case
would
be
ordered...
would
be
served
concurrently
with
the
existing
state
sentences.
the
part
that
corresponds
to
section
924(c),
as
required
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
would
be
made
consecutive
both
to
federal
sentences
and
to
the
state
sentences
that
are
already
being
served.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
state
sentence
is
independent.
section
924(c),
like
all
federal
sentencing
statutes,
in
our
view
speaks
solely
to
a
federal
question,
how
a
federal
court
imposing
a
federal
sentence
for
a
federal
crime,
may
order
the
calculation
of
the
federal
sentence.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
not
in
those
terms,
justice
kennedy.
there
is
a
case
from
this
court,
punsey
v.
fessendon,
which
is
at
258
u.s.
254,
which
encompasses
a
principle
of
primary
jurisdiction,
which
is
that
each
of
the
two
sovereigns,
state
and
federal,
may
lend
someone
to
the
other
government
so
he
may
be
tried,
yet
choose
not
to
relinquish
him
for
the
service
of
the
other
sovereign
sentence
until
they
choose
to,
but
under
the
statutes
that
we
have,
we
would
not
take
the
view
that
we
can
break
up
a
term
of
imprisonment
and
to
tell
the
states
how
to
do
anything.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
view
might
have
some
weight,
justice
scalia,
if
all
there
were
to
this
statute
would
be
the
single
clause,
nor
shall
any
sentence
be
made.
in
context,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
statute
speaks
to
the
duty
of
the
federal
sentencing
court
at
the
time
it
imposed
the
sentences
to
impose
a
sentence
based
on
the
facts
then
existing,
as
is
true
with
federal
sentencing
statutes
generally.
therefore,
given
that
the
federal
court
complied
with
that
duty
at
the
time
it
imposed
sentence,
any
subsequent
court
that
is
not
bound
by
that
duty
would
be
in
no
breach
and,
as
a
result,
it
would
not
be
any
violation
of
the
statute.
quite
simply,
if
you
take
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law
the
court
shall
not
suspend
the
sentence
or
do
any
of
these
other
things
that
a
sentencing
court
would
do,
or,
nor
shall
the
sentence
be
made
concurrent,
in
that
context
the
natural
reading
is
that
the
statute
speaks
to
the
duties
of
the
federal
sentencing
court
as
sentencing
statutes
usually
do
at
the
time
sentence
is
imposed.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
excuse
me,
justice--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--there
are
two
answers
to
that
question,
justice
souter.
the
first
one
is
that
the
policy
of
the
statute
is
that
the
sentence
that
is
imposed
under
section
924(c)
be
made
consecutive
to
any
other
sentence
that
the
defendant
might
be
serving.
it
is
always
the
case,
where
a
sentence
is
made
consecutive
to
another
sentence,
that
any
number
of
circumstances,
for
example,
might
change
the
first
sentence.
all
that
congress
can
do
is
to
say
this
is
what
the
federal
court
may
make
the
sentence
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
and
until
and
unless
congress
chooses
to
go
forward
and
to
say
that
this
is
a
national
policy,
not
of
instruction
to
the
federal
courts
about
how
to
do
their
business,
but
of
instruction
also
to
the
state
courts
about
how
to
do
theirs,
the
statute
simply
doesn't
speak
to
the
question.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
if
that
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--if
that
is
a
course
that
is
allowed
by
state
law--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
absolutely
true,
justice
scalia,
and
the
same
would
be
true
if
he
went
back
to
the
governor
of
the
state
and
told
them,
i
have
received
an
unduly
long
sentence,
would
you
please
exercise
your
discretion
under
state
law
to
make
my
state
sentence
go
away,
and
to
thereby
remove
the
predicate
for
the
consecutive
sentence
in
the
federal
court.
i'm
not
saying
that
that
would
effectuate
the
federal
policy
to
the
fullest
possible
extent
that
one
might
take
such
a
policy,
but
under
the
terms
of
this
statute
as
written,
it
would,
because
the
policy,
as
we
have
explained,
is
one
that
speaks
to
the
actions
of
the
federal
sentencing
court
when
imposing
sentence,
and
it
is
that
court--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--oh,
i
think
both,
justice
stevens.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
as
i
indicated
to
justice
scalia,
justice
stevens,
it
is
our
view,
and
we
think
it's
right--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
it
is
our
view
that,
as
the
court
has
always
stated,
the
clarity
of
the
language
turns
on
context,
and
if
all
we
had
to
go
to...
through
were
a
federal
statute
that
says,
anyone
who
has
been
sentenced
for
a
firearms
charge
shall
never
have
a
concurrent
sentence,
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
the
statute,
that
might
give
rise
to
the
issue
of
whether
that
binds
the
state
courts
as
well.
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
first
defines
a
crime
and
then
makes
a
direction
to
the
court
not
to
suspend
the
sentence
or
to
impose
a
concurrent
sentence--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
have
two
answers
to
your
question,
justice
scalia.
the
first
one
is
that
i
agree
with
your
reading
in
isolation.
as
i
pointed
out,
that
reading
would
ignore
what
comes
earlier
in
the
statute,
which
gives
context
to
what
the
subject
for
who
may
not
impose
may
be.
the
second
answer
is
that,
as
we--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
there
are
two
things,
justice
stevens.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
a
definition
of
a
federal
offense,
which
is
something
that
normally
gives
rise
to
federal
sentencings,
and
second
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that's
right
as
an
instructions
to
the
federal
court
as
to
what
they
may
order.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
doesn't
really
speak
to
the
state
courts
as
to
what--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
but
the...
let
me
make
two
further
points.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
there
was
a
second
part
to
my
first
point--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--excuse
me,
justice
scalia,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
i
was
getting
to
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--which
is
that
the
language
that
justice
scalia
read
in
isolation,
which
we
concede
would
bear
that
reading,
doesn't
really
have
a
subject,
and
it
is
part
of
a
sentence
that
starts
with,
the
court
shall
not,
and
in
our
view
in
that
context
it
is
most
reasonable
to
read
the
court
as
the
federal
court,
as
the
subject
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--is
implicit
in
the
clause
that
uses
the
passive
voice.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that's
right,
and
most
sentence--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--of
the
general
court,
that
is
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
i
think
i've
made
my
first
point,
which
is
in
essence
that
you
have
to
infer
a
subject
for
the
clause
in
the
passive
voice
and
that,
given
that
the
very
same
sentence
starts
with
a
clause
in
the
active
voice
the
more
reasonable
reading,
even
if
it
would
bear
another,
is
that
the
subject
is
that
of
the
federal
court.
i
would
like
to
have
a--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--this
case...
excuse
me.
this
court
has
had
cases
in
which
similar
grammatical
difficulties
have
been
present,
justice
scalia.
in
the
wilson
case,
i
think,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
also
deals
with
how
federal
sentences
are
administered,
the
court
had
before
it
a
statute
that
also
was
written
in
the
passive
voice
and
the
question
then
was,
does
this
give
a
right
or
a
duty
to
the
sentencing
court
or
to
the
bop,
and
the
court
went
into
the
context
of
the
statute
and
to
some
extent
into
the
history
to
conclude
that
it
did
not
give
any
rights
or
duties
to
the
sentencing
courts,
but
it
confided
the
duties
to
be
carried
out
under
the
statute
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
alone,
and
i
think
that
that's
not
an
unusual
act
of
statutory
interpretation.
i
don't
want
to
let
go
of
the
second
point--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
well,
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
mean,
you
can
put
it
that
way,
but
i
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
and
i
think...
and
i
really
will
concede,
justice
stevens,
that
if
all
i
had
were
an
independent
freestanding
sentence
that
began
with
the
term
of
imprisonment,
this
might
raise
a
different
question.
to
just
touch
upon
our...
or,
our
second
point
is
that
to
the
extent
the
language
would
bear
another
reading,
and
to
the
extent
that
you
might
read
the
language
in
isolation
as
speaking
to
the
duties
of
state
courts
imposing
sentences
under
state
law,
there
is
a
section
that
is
also
part
of
the
gun
control
act,
section
927,
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief
in
one
of
the
footnotes,
which
indicates
that
it
was
not...
in
footnote
7
at
page
10...
which
indicates
that
it
was
not,
in
fact,
congress'
intention
to
occupy
the
field
of
sentencing
for
these
offenses,
and
that
they
did
not
intend
to
divest
the
state
courts
of
the
authority
that
they
would
ordinarily
have.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
agree
that
it
is
not
a
necessary
component
of
our
case
that
we
show
the
premise
of
the
question
to
be
wrong,
justice
scalia.
i
think
in
a
spirit
of
candor
we
can
tell
you
that
we
have
never
read
the
statute
in
that
way,
and
we
have
no
intention
of
applying
it
that
way.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
that
you
are
right,
justice
ginsburg,
in
that
to
the
extent
congress
ever
tries
to
control
the
processes
of
state
courts
applying
state
law
and
tell
them
what
to
do,
that
fairly
interesting
and
maybe
difficult
federalism
issues
would
come
up
that
may
call
that
as
one
of
the
principles.
one
of
the
interesting
facets
of
this
case
is
that
there
is
a
general
statute
that
governs
whether
federal
courts
may
impose
sentences
that
are
concurrent
or
consecutive,
section
3584,
which
is
quoted
both
in
our
opening
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief.
in
our
reply
brief
i
believe
the
pertinent
part
is
quoted
at
page
4,
footnote
2.
that
is
the
general
residual
federal
statute
that
deals
with
the
question
whether
a
federal
court
may
impose
a
concurrent
sentence
or
a
consecutive
sentence,
and
the
statute
that
respondents
urge
should
be
applied
to
them
here.
now,
the
interesting
thing
about
that
statute
is
that
even
though
it
authorizes
a
concurrent
term
of
imprisonment,
it
doesn't
speak
to
state
terms
of
imprisonment
at
all,
so
that
if
one
were
to
take
the
rule
of
construction
being
urged
for
here,
the
logical
consequence
would
be
that
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
the
imposition
of
a
concurrent
term
of
imprisonment.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
a
state
offense,
i
believe,
of
assault.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
they
had.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
by
the
time--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
that
is
right,
and
that
would
be
the
usual
area
in
which
our
reading
of--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
our
view
is
that
the
statute
tells
a
federal
district
court
imposing
sentence
for
a
federal
offense--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
it
should
make
this
sentence
consecutive
to--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--whatever
else
there
is.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
would
not--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
would
not
happen
under
the
guidelines.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
no.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
for
example,
the
armed
bank
robbery
statute,
18
u.s.c.
2113,
2113(a),
if
i
recall,
defines
the
crime
of
bank
robbery.
2513(d)
imposes
an
additional
authorized
sentence
of
5
years
under
the
bank
robbery
statute
for
a
bank
robbery
that
is
carried
out
with
a
weapon.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
breyer,
the
issue
that
you
just
posed
was
one
of
the
questions
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
busic
case.
the
court
in
that
case
took
the
view
that
i
gather
you
would
instinctively
take
of
how
that
case
should
turn
out.
in
1984
congress
turned
around
and
said
no,
we
didn't
mean
that,
and
overruled
in
effect
for
future
cases
the
outcome
in
busic
and
as
a
result
of
that
change
the
statute
now
reads
that
the
mandatory
5-year
sentence
may
apply
to
any
offense,
including
one
that
has
an
enhancement
for
a
firearm.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
mm-hmm.
that
is
right,
and
it's
very
plain
from
the
legislative
history
that
accompanied
the
1984
amendments
that
congress
was
unhappy
with
the
outcome
in
busic
and
changed
the
statute
just
to
make
that
possible.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
the
relevant
language
that
does
that
is
at
the
top
of
page
2
in
our
brief,
where
congress
added
a
parenthetical
that
reads,
including
a
crime
of
violence
or
drug
trafficking
crimes
which
provides
for
an
enhanced
punishment
if
committed
by
the
use
of
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon
or
device.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
does,
and
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
busic
and
simpson
cases.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
you
see,
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
i
do
not
disagree
with
your
statement
up
to
the
very
last
clause,
which
is
that
it
is
true
that
this
is
a
statute
that
applies
only
to
federal
sentencings,
but
one
of
the
things
it
does
is
to
instruct
a
federal
court
as
to
how
the
sentence
should
be
imposed
and,
by
extension,
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
as
to
how
the
sentence
should
be
administered,
and
it
is
to
them
that
the
instruction
goes,
this
sentence
shall
not
start
before
that
other
sentence
has
been
concluded.
it
doesn't
act
on
a
state
court,
and
it
doesn't
act
on
a
state
sentence.
it
merely
takes--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--takes
that
as
a
point
of
reference
for
federal
officials
discharging
their
duties
under
federal
law.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
oh,
i
see.
no,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
one
is
that
the
first
sentence
of
this
very
statute
uses
the
expansive
language,
any
crime,
and
goes
on
expressly
to
qualify
it
by
reference
to
only
crimes
that
are
federal
crimes
and
when
the
same
expansive
language,
any
crime
or
offense
or
sentence
is
used
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute
and
does
not
so--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--restrict
it,
there
is
a
fair
inference
that
congress
did
not
mean
the
qualifications
then.
the
second
answer
to
that
is
the
answer
that
i
started
to
give
to
justice
ginsburg
concerning
section
3584,
which
is
a
residual
statute
that
governs
concurrency
and
consecutivity,
and
it
does
not
itself
make
reference
to
state
sentences
either.
as
a
historical
matter,
before
the
statute
was
passed
in
section
19...
in
1984,
the
rule
in
the
federal
courts
was
that
a
federal
sentence
could
not
be
concurrent
with
a
state
sentence,
and
the
legislative
history
of
section
3584
makes
clear
that
one
of
the
things
that
section...
that
the
residual
statute
meant
to
do
with
unqualified
reference
to
terms
of
imprisonment
that
don't
mention
state
law
was
to
allow
federal
courts,
when
otherwise
appropriate,
to
impose
a
sentence
that
would
be
concurrent
to
a
state
term.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
because
i
think
as
an
empirical
matter
it
will
be
the
case
in
most
of
the
cases
that
congress
may
have
contemplated
that
the
sentences
imposed
later
will
correspond
to
later-occurring
crimes,
and
it's
not
necessary
to
think
that
they
crafted
the
entire
sentencing
structure
of
the
federal
courts
to
fit
the
facts
of
a
dual
successive
prosecution.
but
even
apart
from
that,
i
think
that
the
implicit
assumption
in
the
premise
is
that
a
statute
that
requires
a
consecutive
sentence
purports
to
speak
to
what
may
happen
in
the
future,
and
i
think
that
is
not
empirically
founded.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
have
seen
it...
i
don't
know,
justice
scalia,
and
as
a
nonnative
speaker
of
the
language,
i
feel
hesitant--
[laughter]
--to
give
the
court
advice
on
these
sorts
of
matters.
i
can
tell
you
that
i
have
seen
it
in
the
reported
cases
dealing
with
the
issue,
and
i
will
leave
it
at
that,
and
if
i
could
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
we
have
nothing
further.
