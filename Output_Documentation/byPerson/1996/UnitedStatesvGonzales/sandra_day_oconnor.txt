justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
estrada,
do
you
take
the
position
that
section
924(c)
requires
the
separate
sentence
given
for
that
violation
to
run
before
any
other
sentence,
or
could
it
be
required
after
any
other
sentence?
just,
what
the
statute
refers
to
is
running
sentences
concurrently,
so
is
it
okay
to
order
its
service
after
the
expiration
of
a
state
court
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
take
the
position
that
it
has
to
always
be
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
estrada,
can
i
clarify
one
thing
about
this
case?
what
was
the
state
prosecution
for?
it
wasn't
brought
under
18
u.s.
code
924
(c).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state
had
already
imposed
a
sentence
for
that
crime?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
before
the
federal
court--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--tried
the
defendant
for
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
had
already
occurred--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
in
fact
all
the
federal
court
of
appeals
decisions
dealing
with
this
situation
as
i
understand
it
have
involved
sentences
by
state
courts
that
had
already
been
imposed
before
the
succeeding
federal
prosecution
under
924(c).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
so
you're
saying,
in
that
circumstance,
which
was
also
the
circumstance
here,
that
the
federal
court
is
governed
in
its
sentencing
and
must
make
it
run
at
least
consecutively--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
the
state
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
i
guess
on
that
the
hardest
point
is
that
the
state
sentence
involved
an
additional
year
actually
served
as
a
mandatory
additional
year
under
state
law
for
the
very
possession
of
the
firearm
that
is
also
the
subject
of
the
extra
5
years
under
federal
law,
and
i
suppose
that,
if
you
apply
the
extra
5
years
under
federal
law
into
federal
cases,
that
will
never
arise.
it
would
never
happen
that
the
extra
5
years
would
be
imposed
consecutively
to
an
additional
sentence
that
had
as
its
base
solely
the
possession
of
that
very
gun--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
really
see
how
it
does
affect
state
law
under
the
government's
argument.
indeed,
i
suppose
there
are
many
situations
where
there's
a
federal
offense,
not
924
involved,
but
some
federal
offense,
and
some
state
court...
some
state
law
will
mandate
that
any
state
sentence
for
a
state
offense
based
on
similar
conduct
has
to
run
consecutively,
or
not
concurrently.
i
mean,
you
could
have
it
in
reverse,
and
i
don't
see
that
these
schemes
prohibit
that,
these
federal
laws.
we
face
that
often,
don't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
a
state
itself
might
be
in
the
position
of,
look,
your
federal
requirements
are
what
they
are,
but
we're
going
to
make
our
sentence
anyway
not
serve
concurrently
with
the
federal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
federal
government
says,
and
vice
versa,
the
federal
government,
the
congress
can
pass
a
law
making
some
particular
sentence
for
a
particular
federal
crime
not
serve
concurrently,
and
their
argument
is
that
congress
has
done
here,
so
it
seems
to
me
just
the
opposite
side
of
the
same
coin.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
no.
maybe
you
misunderstood
my
question.
i
wasn't
proposing
that
the
federal
government
was
here
telling
the
state
what
to
do.
they're
not,
and
that's
not
the
government's
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
isn't
their
position
as
i've
heard
it
explained
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
heard
mr.
estrada
say
the
state
could
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
ambiguous
if
you
say
it
only
applies...
924(c)
applies
to
sentences
imposed
by
federal
courts.
that's
not
ambiguous,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
government
isn't
here
saying
that
these
statutes
affect
the
state
sentence.
it's
saying
it
affects
the
federal
court
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
that
one
sentence
in
some
committee
report?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
this
court
has
never
felt
that
it
was
bound
by
that
kind
of
a--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--little
snippet
from
a
legislative
committee
report.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
i
didn't
think
924(c)
applied
to
anything
but
the
offense
described
in
924.
