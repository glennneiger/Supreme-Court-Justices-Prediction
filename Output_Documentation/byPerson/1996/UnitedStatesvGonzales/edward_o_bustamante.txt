mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
bustamante.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
should
affirm
the
tenth
circuit,
because
the
government
ignores
proper
methods
of
statutory
construction
in
this
case,
and
they
base
their
entire
argument
in
this
case
on
the
false
premise
that
the
any
used
in
924(c)(1)
is
capable
of
only
one
meaning.
that
term
actually
has
multiple
definitional
possibilities,
and
where
there
are
multiple
definitional
possibilities,
this
court...
any
practitioner
should
examine
the
entire
text
of
the
statute
and
place
the
word
in
context
with
this
entire
statutory
scheme.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
your
honor,
i
believe...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
if
the
court
examines
924(c)(1)
and
the
language
of
924(c)(1)
and
then
looks
at
the
history
of
924(c)(1).
i
think
it
becomes
clear
that
924(c)(1)
only
applies
to
federal
sentences.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
justice
scalia,
i
believe
the
difference,
and
i
think
it's
a
consistent
interpretation,
is
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
legislative
history
of
3584--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--not
about
the
text.
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
if
the
court...
i
think
it's
clear
from
3584
that
a
court
has
discretion
under
that
statute
to
run
sentences
concurrently
or
consecutively,
and
i
think
the
difference
between
3584,
other
than
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
is
that
924(c)(1)
does
something
very
different,
which
is,
it
takes
absolute
discretion
away
from
a
court,
which
is
a
major
change,
your
honor,
in
the
history
of
sentencing.
throughout
history,
federal
courts,
state
courts
have
been
given
great
discretion
in
running...
deciding
whether
sentences
shall
run
concurrently
or
consecutively.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
it
did
take
it
away
from
a
federal
court,
which
is
a
significant
matter.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
justice
breyer,
i
believe
the
odd
result
in
this
specific
case,
and
again
this
case
does
have
unusual
facts,
because
it
was
a
consecutive
prosecution,
is
that
because
the
state
sentence
occurred
first
and
the
federal
sentence
occurred
second,
what
in
fact
occurred
in
this
case
is
that
the...
what
the
government
seeks
is
a
doubling
of
the
sentence
based
on
the
same
conduct.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
true--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--your
honor,
i
believe...
it's
not
that
it's
an
odd
result,
your
honor.
it's
that
the
government
is
saying
that
it's
a
compelled
result,
and
what
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
is
that
the
government
is
encouraging
practitioners
to
basically
play
table
tennis
between
federal
court
and
state
courts.
they
give...
and
i
don't
believe
the
government
can
have
it
both
ways,
your
honor.
they
state
in
their
opening
briefs...
brief
fairly
boastfully
that
this
does
not
run
concurrently
to
any
sentence.
in
their
reply
brief,
they
state--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--they
state
in
their
opening
briefs,
your
honor,
that
this
shall
not
run
concurrent
to
any
sentence.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
that's
correct,
and
they
do
not
specify
whether
it's
federal
or
state.
in
their
reply
brief
they
make
a
concession
that
it
was...
it
would
be
okay
for
a
state
court
to
run
their
sentence
concurrent
to
the
federal
sentence,
so
i
think
they're--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
government
concedes
this
applies
to
federal
courts,
concedes
it
applies
to
federal
sentences,
concedes
it
applies
to
federal
offenses,
but
they're
very--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--that's
true,
your
honor,
a
lot
of
things
do
turn
on
time,
but
with
the
government's
concessions,
and
if
you
place
their
example
in
reality,
your
honor,
is
that
what
could
occur
is
you
have
the
state
prosecution
first,
then
a
federal
prosecution,
then
it's
fairly
easy
for
the
lawyer
in
the
state's
court
then
to
go
back,
after
the
federal
prosecution
to
then
ask
for
a
reduced
sentence
or
a--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--sentence
concurrent.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--your
honor,
that
is
a
possible
remedy.
however,
i
don't
think
that
criminal
culpability
or
sentencing
statutes
were
set
out
to
allow
a
game
of
chance,
which
is--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--i
wouldn't
want
that.
but
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
problem
is,
is
that
if
the
court
were
to
read
that
into
the
legislation,
then
i
think
in
effect
it
would
be
allowing
this
statute,
which
is
not
very
clear,
just
have
no
clear
statement
to
preempt
state
law.
in
the
case
of
a
federal
prosecution
that
occurred
first
and
a
state
prosecution
occurring
second,
clearly
the
state
sovereign
should
have
the
authority
if
it
seems
proper
to
run
their
sentence
concurrent
to
the
federal
sentencing--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--i
believe
justice
scalia's
premise
was
that
if
the
statute
was
read
at
the
federal
court,
that
no
sentence
would
run
concurrent
to
the
federal
sentence
if
it
occurred
first,
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
preemption,
because
the
state
court
would
not
be
allowed
to
run
their
sentence--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--your
honor,
we've
come
to
this
court
for
the
remedy
we're
seeking
because
it's
the
government's
goal
in
this
case
to
ensure
that...
one
of
several
things.
to
ensure
that
the
924(c)
gun
count
runs
consecutive
to
the
state
sentence,
but
also
i
believe,
your
honor,
they
seek
to
also
violate
3584(a),
your
honor,
which
states
that
a
sentence,
when
someone
goes
in
and
starts
serving
a
federal
sentence,
that
sentence
shall
be
considered
one
aggregate
sentence.
your
honor,
what
could
occur
in
this
case
and
in
cases
in
the
future
is
that...
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
sentencing
judge
did
run
the
underlying
offense
concurrent
to
the
state
sentence.
what
could
occur
in
this
case
and
other
cases,
your
honor,
is
that
you
would
in
fact
have
the
federal
sentence
beginning,
then
the
sentence
would
stop
while
the
state
sentence
would
continue,
and
then
at
some
point,
indeterminate
point
in
the
future
the
federal
924(c)(1)
gun
count
would
begin,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
major
problems
with
the
government's
interpretation
of--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--yes,
justice--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--excuse
me...
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
and
i
believe
that
is
in
the--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--i
believe
the
last
sentence
to
that
statute
states
that
when
a
prisoner
begins
to
serve
a
federal
sentence
it
shall
be
considered
one
aggregate
sentence,
and
what
could
result
in
this
case
and
future
cases
is
that
there
would
be
a
gap,
a
federal
gap
in
sentences,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
is
what
congress
intended
in
3584
or
924(c)(1),
especially
when
you
consider
the
committee
report
of
924(c)(1),
which
states,
members
of
the
court,
that
in
their
opinion
they
are...
it
is
their
intent
that
the
924(c)(1)
gun
count
begin
first,
and
i
think
if
the
court
looks
at
that,
that's
the
only
practical
way
to
apply
924(c)(1).
924(c)(1)
clearly
was
enacted
to
take
all
discretion
away
from
a
court.
a
court...
a
person
convicted
of
a
924(c)(1)
sentence
must
do
prison
time.
that
does
not
affect
the
court's
discretion
at
all
as
to
the
underlying
offense,
so
it's
really
impractical--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--you
can
consider
them
consistently,
your
honor,
if
a
federal
sentencing
judge
is
given
discretion
to
run
a...
this
sentence
concurrent
to
a
state
sentence.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
there's
no
inconsistency
if
it
is
only
applied
to
federal
sentences.
clearly,
if
someone
is
in
federal
court--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
3584,
from
its
legislative
history
and
from
the
text
of
the
statute,
allows
a
federal
judge
to
run
his
sentence
either
concurrently
or
consecutively
to
a
state
sentence.
but
i
would
premise
that,
your
honor,
by
stating
that
in
order
for
the
judge
to
do
that
he
must
first
apply
a
guideline
analysis,
and
if
the
guidelines
state
that
this
sentence
shall
run
concurrent,
then
the
court
may
consider
doing
that,
and
either
do
an
upward
or
downward
departure,
depending
on
what
he
feels
appropriate.
if
the
guideline
states
that
it
shall
be
consecutive,
then
again
the
court
can
do
an
upward
or
downward
departure
depending
on
what
he
feels
is
appropriate.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
problem
is,
is
that
there
was
no
guideline
analysis
that
could
be
done
as
to
this
particular
sentence.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
your
honor,
i
believe
in
that
instance
the
person...
i
believe
probably
the
guideline
would
be
consistent
with
that,
and
the
guideline
would
say
that
if
you
commit
an
offense
while...
a
pending
offense
while
you
are
awaiting
sentencing
occurs,
then
it
shall
be
consecutive,
so
i
think
the
guideline
analysis
and
the--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--the
two
could
not
be
inconsistent,
your
honor.
however,
it
would
be
up
to
the
court
to
always
and
first
try
to
harmonize
the
guideline
with
the
statute,
and
i
think
in
that
instance
the
guideline
and
the
statute
would
probably
be
synonymous.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
i
believe
what
i'm
saying,
what...
i
hope
what
i'm
saying
is
that
3584
clearly
from
its
legislative
history
can
allow
the
court
under
a
guideline
analysis
to
run
a
sentence
either
consecutive
or
concurrent
to
a
state
sentence.
924(c)(1)
is
a
much
more
specific
statute,
and
that
analysis,
if
there's
a
guideline
analysis
at
all,
only
requires
a
federal
sentencing
judge
to
run
that
sentence
consecutive
to
a
federal
sentence.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
your
honor--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
the
way
the
two
statutes
are
distinguished
is
that
924(c)(1),
when
it
says
shall
not
run
concurrent,
i
believe
is
only
applied
to
the
federal
sentence,
the
underlying
federal
sentence
for
which
the
gun
enhancement
is
imposed.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
yes,
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
19...
924(c)(1)
and
1994...
84
was
amended.
i
think
it
was
amended
in
direct
response.
your
honor,
to
the
united
states
v.
busic
and
united
states
v.
simpson,
and
in
truth,
your
honor,
there
was
a
time
when
i
feared
the
language
of
924(c)(1).
i
don't
any
more,
because
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
if
you
look
at
the
congress'
direct
response
to
the
busic
and
simpson
cases,
i
think
it's
clear
that
statute
was
amended
only
to
correct
what
they
felt
were
improper
decisions
by
the
court
in
busic
and
in
simpson.
your
honor,
section
1
of
924(c)(1)
deals
with
what
kind
of
cases
shall
be
prosecuted
under
this
section.
section
2
deals...
states
they
be
crimes
that
are
prosecuted
in
federal
court.
section
3
states
how
the
crime
is
committed.
section
4
states
that
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
the
court
may
not
prorate
the
sentence,
which
really
states
that
you
have
no
discretion
to
suspend
this
enhanced
sentence,
and
section
5,
your
honor,
i
think
is
the
section
that
nails
the
coffin
into
busic
and
simpson
and
says
that
nor
shall
this
run
concurrent
with
any
other
sentence,
and
i
think
what
they're
referring
to
is
that
they
do
not
want
the
court
to
run
the
gun
enhancement
concurrent
to
the
underlying
offense
at
that
time.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
i'm
referring,
your
honor,
to
the
last
part
of
924(c)(1).
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
yes.
it's...
sentence
5,
which
states,
nor
shall--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--this
run
concurrent
with
any
other
sentence,
your
honor.
i
think
what
they're
saying
in
nailing
the
coffin
in
busic
and
simpson
is
that
a
federal
judge
may
not
run
that
sentence
concurrent
even
though
he
has
to
impose
a
prison
sentence,
nor
shall
he
impose
that
concurrent
to
the
underlying
federal
offense.
i
think
that,
your
honor,
clearly
lays
out
why
this
only
applies
to
federal
sentences.
your
honor,
i
think
other
sections
of
the
comprehensive
control...
comprehensive
crime
control
act
confirm
that
924(c)(1)
only
applies
to
federal
sentences.
the
congress
also
referred
to
state
and
federal
laws
in
3564(b)
and
3624(e).
in
both
those
sections,
your
honor,
they
were
contemplating
that
federal
probation
and
federal
supervised
release
could
run
concurrent
to
a
state
sentence,
so
they
are
contemplating
that
state
and
federal
sentences
shall
run
concurrently,
and
they
are
contemplating
that
these
sections
are
possible
they
run
concurrently,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
highly
significant,
because
it
goes
to
congress'
overall
sentencing
scheme.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
problem
with
the
government's
argument
is
that
they
attach
a
layman's
definition
to
the
term,
any.
they
ask
for
an
expansive
interpretation
of
the
term,
any
other.
in
fact,
they
have
argued
the
exact
opposite
in
the
past.
in
the
government's
reply
brief
they
refer
to
united
states
v.
alvarez...
the
united
states
v.
alvarez-sanchez,
and
in
that
case
the
defendant-respondent
was
seeking
a
more
expansive
term
of
the
term,
any.
the
government...
the
court,
at
the
government's
urging,
asked
the
court
to
apply
proper
methods
of
statutory
construction
and
to
not
allow
the
term,
any
to
have
an
all-expansive
interpretation,
and
the
court
in
fact
did
imply...
apply
proper
methods
of
construction
and
stated
that
the
term,
any
in
18
u.s.c.
3501
only
applied
to
federal
law
authorities.
your
honor,
i
think
there's
other
compelling
reasons
for
the
court
to
reject
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
as
erroneous,
and
the
states,
your
honor,
in
enforcing
criminal
conduct
clearly
have
primary
authority.
i
think
they
should
also
have
primary
responsibility
in
prosecuting
persons
in
their
state
in
enforcing
local
criminal
conduct.
i
think
the
government's
interpretation
in
this
case
directly
affects
the
delicate
balance
between
federal
and
states,
and
absent
a
clear
statement
from
the
congress,
i've
asked
the
court
to
reject
the
government's
argument
and
not
allow
the
924(c)(1)
or
federal
authorities
to
interfere
with
the
state's
authority
to
enforce
local
criminal
conduct.
i
think
there's
two
ways,
your
honor--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
would
have
the
authority,
if
they
so
chose,
to
run
their
sentence
consecutive
to
the
federal
prosecution.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
your
honor,
i
believe
congress
clearly
has
the
authority
and
power
to
tell
a
state
your
sentence
shall
not
run
concurrent--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
was
their
position
in
their
opening
brief.
they
have
changed
that
position
in
their
reply
brief.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
i
believe
that
clearly
the
state
has
the
authority
to
run
their
sentence
consecutive,
but
they
should
also
have
the
authority
to
run
their
sentence
concurrent,
whatever
the
order--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--your
honor,
he
has
stated
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
does
point
to
the
ambiguousness
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
it
points
out
to
the
problems
in
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
i
think
it's
ambiguous,
your
honor,
first
in
how
you
apply
first
924(c)(1),
in
which
order
it
should
go
in,
your
honor,
and
how
it
affects
the
state
sentence.
your
honor,
there
is
a
guideline
in
this
case
that
does
possibly
affect
the
state
sentence
and
possibly
affect
the
federal
sentence,
your
honor,
and
that
is
5g1.3.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
stating
that
the
federal
government
does
not
affect
the
state
sentence
in
any
way.
however,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in
the
application
of
the
federal
sentence
it
must
by
necessity
affect
the
state
sentence,
your
honor,
and
i
state
that
because
if
you
go
with
the
committee
report
that
the
924(c)(1)
must
be
applied
first,
your
honor,
then--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--well,
your
honor,
it's
not
only
the
one
sentence--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
not
just
that
one
snippet.
i
think
there
are...
the
eleventh
and
sixth
circuit
have
followed
that
order,
and
i
think
that's
the
only
practical
way
to
apply
924(c)(1),
and
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
if
924(c)(1)
is
applied
to
run
consecutively
to
a
state
sentence,
then,
your
honor,
then
the
underlying
offense
must
also
run
consecutive,
and
you're
back
to
the
point
where
you've
doubled
this
person's
custodial
time.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
your
honor,
it
applies...
if
a
person
has
committed
an
underlying
offense
and
then
has
a
924(c)(1)
sentence,
those
sentences
must
both
be
mandated
to
that
defendant.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
that's
true,
your
honor,
if
the
court...
but
if
924(c)(1)
is
to
be
applied
practically,
then
i
think
that
what
would
happen,
you'd
have
to
have
a
prison
time
for
924(c)(1),
and
then
for
the
remaining
underlying
offense
the
court
still
would
have
discretion
to
grant
a
downward
departure
to
probation.
it
would
be
impossible--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--your
honor,
i
think
the
flaw
is,
your
honor,
is
that
clearly
924(c)(1)
does
require
a
prison
sentence.
any
other
underlying
offense
may
or
may
not
require
a
prison
sentence.
it
would
be
impossible,
or
at
least
impractical
for
a
court
to
grant
someone
supervised
release
and
they
serve
that
sentence
and
then
4
years
later
they
begin
a
924(c)(1)
sentence.
the
court
would
not
do
that.
what
the
court--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
i
think
it
would
require
some
kind
of
downward
departure
for
the
underlying
offense,
your
honor,
but
i
can't
imagine
a
court
giving
someone
supervised
release,
they
serve
a
supervised
release
for
4
years--
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
o.
bustamante
i
guess,
your
honor,
i
guess
the
concern
is...
my
time
is
up.
