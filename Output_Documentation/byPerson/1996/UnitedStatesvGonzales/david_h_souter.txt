then
everything's
going
to
turn
on
whose
sentence
is
first.
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
everything...
then
the
result
is
simply
going
to
turn
on
whose
sentence
is
first.
if
they
do
a
state
sentence
first,
then,
in
effect,
you
get
the
policy
carried
out
when
the
federal
sentencing
follows
it.
if
the
feds
sentence
first,
in
effect
the
state
can
negate
the
policy
by
saying
everything
we
impose
is
going
to
run
concurrent,
including
the
premium,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
estrada,
you
answered
some
of
the
questions
from
justice
scalia
or
justice
stevens
about
the
scope
of
the
nor
shall
clause
by
saying
it
occurs
in
a
sentence
which
is
addressed
to
federal
sentences,
and
that
provides
the
context.
why
should
we
confine
our
contextual
reference
to
sentences?
why
don't
we
approach
this
case
with
a...
sort
of
a
section-based
contextualism,
and
the
principle
address
of
the
section,
i
suppose,
is
to
federal
sentencing
and
the
relationships
of
federal
sentences,
so
if
we're
going
to
look
at
context,
why
don't
we
look
at
it
more
broadly
than
you
would
and
find
that
a
reason
not
to
apply
the
any
sentence
reference
to
state
sentences?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
i
grant
you
that,
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
the
question
about
the
nor
shall
clause
was
not
that
it
could
not
be
addressed
or
effectively
be
enforced
against
a
state
court.
that's
a
separate
issue.
we'll
leave
that
aside.
your
answer
was
in
the
context
we
can
infer
that
it's
not
being
addressed,
and
don't
we
have
sort
of
no
more
or
less
ambiguity
when
we
get
to
the
reference
to
any
sentence
being
served?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
that
gives
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
i
think
your
answer
is
a
fair
answer,
but
i
guess
i
have
one
follow-up
question
to
it,
and
that
is,
if
there
is
any
question
about
whether
your
answer
is
sort
of
dispositive,
isn't
it
fair
to
look
to
the
point
that
was
brought
out
earlier,
and
that
is
that
on
your
theory
there's
sort
of
a
game
of
chance
going
on,
because
if
the...
in
this
case,
for
example,
if
the
state
sentence
had
not
been
imposed
first,
the
result
would
be
different
here,
and
rather
than
allow
this
statute
to
be
administered
in
a
way
that
is
going
to
turn
it
into
a
game
of
chance,
which
sentence...
depending
on
which
sentencer
gets
there
first,
why
isn't
it
more
reasonable
to
interpret
it
the
way
the
respondents
claim?
