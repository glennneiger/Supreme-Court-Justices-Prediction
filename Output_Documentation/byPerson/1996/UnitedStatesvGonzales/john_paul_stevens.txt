mr.
estrada,
that's
certainly
a
reasonable
interpretation,
but
it's
not
what
the
statute
says.
do
you
think...
you
say
that's
a
literal
reading,
or
are
you
just
making
a
very
sensible
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
says...
it's
a
flat
prohibition,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it
should
be
read
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--before
you
go
to
the
second,
and
i
want
you
to
get
there,
what
is
it
earlier
in
the
statute
that's
inconsistent
with
that
sentence?
that's
what
i
didn't
quite
follow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
doesn't
cut
any
ice,
because
this
last
sentence
clearly
contemplates,
not
concurrent
with
state
or
federal
sentences.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
then
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
it
says,
we're
just
talking
about
a
sentence
for
federal
crimes.
that
doesn't
undermine
the
literal
reading
of
the
last
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
another
point,
i
know,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
still
have
the
second
point.
the
first
point,
you're
assuming
that
the
words,
the
term
of
imprisonment,
are
not
the
subject,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
grammarians
might
disagree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
of
your
points?
do
you
think
3584(a)
applies
only
to
federal
sentences
also?
