justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
said
you
were
thinking
the
same
thing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
mean...
when
you
refer
to
the
person
entitled
to
compensation,
you
mean
just
compensation
under
the
act,
not
compensation
in
a
tort
action.
isn't
that
what
you
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know,
but
what
does
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
mean?
does
it
mean
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
act,
or
does
it
mean
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
in
a
separate
tort
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
clear,
isn't
it,
from
933(a)
which
says...
which
distinguishes
between
compensation
and
damages?
it
ends...
is
liable...
he
need
not
elect
whether
to
receive
such
compensation
or
to
recover
damages
against
such
persons.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brinkmann,
just
last
week
we
had
a
case
involving
the
word
employee
in
which
the
government
was
arguing
that
the
word
employee
sometimes
in
the
statute
can
mean
current
employees
and
sometimes
can
mean
current
or
past
employees.
now,
why
can't
that
principle
be
applied
here,
that
in
some
provisions
here,
the
person
entitled
to
such
compensation
means
the
worker
who
was
injured,
but
in
other
provisions
where
it
makes
eminent
sense,
it
can
mean
him
or
a
person
who
will
later
be
entitled
to
compensation,
not
the
person
now,
but
the
one
who
may
later
be
entitled
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
harm
is
done?
i...
what
harm
is
done?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
harm
i
can
see
that's
being
done
is
that
you're
requiring
her
to
go
to
the
employer
whereas
in
some
situations
that
will
be
a
vain
act
because
she
won't
end
up
being
the
widow.
but
apart
from
that,
how
is
she
prejudiced?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
can
intervene
when
you
don't
have
standing?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
you
can't
intervene
in
a
suit
unless
you
have
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
surely
it's
different
when
the
agency
is
set
up
as
an
adjudicator.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
legislative
court,
an
article
i
court,
is
that
court
a
party
to
any
proceeding
of
the
private
parties
who
then
come
before
us
to
challenge
what
that
article
i
court
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
the
decree
of
the
board...
of...
it
is
not
the
decree
of
the
labor
department,
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
entitles
this
person
to
compensation?
it's
the
decree
of
essentially
an
article
i
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
make
that
evaluation
at
the
time
that
the
settlement
is
entered
into.
right?
and
if
it
turns
out
that
actuarially
you
were
wrong
and
that
in
fact
the
worker
gets
more...
was
entitled
to
more
from
the
employer,
it's
too
bad.
you
just
look
to
the
time
of
the
settlement
to
determine
that
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing.
i
want
to
know
what
time
you
look
to
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
settlement
is
indeed
less
than
what
the
person
would
be
entitled
to
under
this
chapter.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
time
of
the
settlement.
so,
you
have
to
do
actuarial
calculations.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens
if
your
actuarial
calculations
are
wrong
and
the
employer
is
in
fact
liable
for
more
than
what
the
settlement
was?
does
he
end
up
coughing
it
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
but
it
turns...
in
the
event
it
is
wrong,
he
lives
longer
and
therefore
is
entitled
to
more
money
than
we
had
guessed
at
the
time
of
the
settlement,
what
happens?
the
employer
has
to
pay
that
additional
amount.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
risk
is
on
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can
be
figured
out
actuarially
just
as
when
he
is
going
to
die
can
be
figured
out
actuarially.
so,
you
could
compute
that
into
the
calculation,
couldn't
you?
no?
