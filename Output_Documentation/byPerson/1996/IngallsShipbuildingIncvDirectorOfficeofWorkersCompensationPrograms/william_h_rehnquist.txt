95-1081,
ingalls
shipbuilding,
inc.
v.
director,
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs,
department
of
labor.
mr.
salloum,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
salloum,
your
petition
for
certiorari
presented
two
questions,
and
the
second
of
them
was,
does
the
director
of
the
office
of
workmen's
compensation
programs
have
standing
to
respond
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
opposition
to
a
private
party?
are
you
going
touch
on
that
in
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
salloum.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
simply
a
procedural
rule,
isn't
it,
almost
a
pro
forma
type
of
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
that
control
the
outcome
of
something
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that,
say,
the
rules...
a
rule
could
confer
standing
on
a
respondent
party
such
as
the
director
here
even
though
congress
had
not...
had
indicated
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
article
iii
standing
is
required
for...
on
the
part
of
the
intervenor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
can't
confer
standing
in
the
face
of
the
article
iii
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
clark,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
judicial
inquiry
is
warranted
as
to
what
the
statute
says
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clark.
mr.
salloum,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
salloum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
