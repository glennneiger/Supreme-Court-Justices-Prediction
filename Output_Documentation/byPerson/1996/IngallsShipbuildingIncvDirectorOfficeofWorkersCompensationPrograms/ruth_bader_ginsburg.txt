but
they
have
to
be
dependent
at
both
times,
don't
they?
justice
ruth
bader

neither
spouse
would
benefit.
justice
ruth
bader

ms.
brinkmann,
if
we
said,
or
may
be
entitled
to
compensation,
she
would
fit
in
that
category.
if
we...
if
the
words
meant
person
now
or
in
the
future,
that
would
be
a
finite
group
because,
as
just
was
brought
out
in
the
colloquy,
you
must
be
a
dependent
at
the
time
of
the
death,
otherwise
you're
out.
so,
everyone
who's
a
dependent
at
the
time
of
death
is
one
who
may
be
entitled.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
she
does
have
to
be
the
wife
at
that
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
we
know
all...
the
entire
universe
of
people
who
may
be
entitled
we
know
at
the
time
of
injury.

wage
earning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
just
making
the
point
that
we're
talking
about
derivative
liability
and
all
the
people
who
are
derivative
of
the
worker
are
known.
so,
we're
not
dealing
with
the
question
of,
well,
you
really
can't
tell
until
death
who
those
dependents
might
be
or
who
the
spouse
might
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
did
take
a
position
in
your
brief
on
it.
you
said
that
they
should...
the
words
should
be
interpreted
the
same
way
in
both
sections.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask
you
a
very
simpleminded
question.
it
was
one
that
was
brought
up
in
the
brief
on
the
other
side,
and
that
is,
if
you
try
to
envision
what
congress
was
doing
here,
why
would
congress
want
to
say
to
the
widow
or
the
potential
widow
who
settles
shortly
before
the
death,
you
can,
in
effect,
recover
twice,
but
to
the
one
who
settles
after
the
husband
dies,
you
can
recover
only
once?
what
rationality
is
there
to
such
a
scheme?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wynn...
mr.
clark,
one
thing
i
think
perhaps
you
can
teach
us,
although
if
you
think
it's
not
relevant,
let
us
know.
why
wasn't
approval
sought?
we
had
one
person
who
was
clearly
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
the
settlement
wasn't
approved
for
the
worker
or
for
his
potential
widow.
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
of
these
settlements
were...
i
thought...
then
i'm
confused.
i
thought
one
of
the
other
counsels
said
that
some
of
these
settlements
were
made
after
the
worker
was...
yes,
i
think
that...
was
it...
mr.
salloum
said
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
there
were...
none
of
the
settlements
were
approved
although--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
although
some
of
those
settlements
postdated
the
time
when
the
worker
himself
began
to
receive
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
no
approval
was
sought
for
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
salloum,
mrs.
brinkmann
gave
a
different
answer
to
the
question
about
is...
who
is
a
potentially
qualifying
widow.
she
seemed
to
suggest
that
somebody
who
came
into
the
picture
after
the
injury
could
be
a
qualifying
widow.
