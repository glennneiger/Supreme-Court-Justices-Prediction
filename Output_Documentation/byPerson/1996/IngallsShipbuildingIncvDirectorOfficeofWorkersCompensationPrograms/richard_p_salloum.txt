mr.
richard
p.
salloum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
is
allowed
to
stand,
it
would
defeat
the
purpose
that
congress
enacted
section
33(g)
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
which
was
to
protect
an
employer
from
increased
compensation
liability
when
a
worker,
or
those
claiming
through
him,
settle
a
third
party
case
for
less
than
the
compensation
they
would
be
entitled
under
the
longshore
act.
it
would
also
defeat
the
purpose
for
which
congress
passed
section
33(f)
of
the
longshore
act
which
is
the
give
an
employer
credit
to
the
extent
of
net
third
party
recoveries
received
by
a
worker
or
those
claiming
through
him.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
jefferson
yates,
between
1953
and
1967,
worked
as
a
ship
fitter
for
ingalls
shipyard.
he
left
ingalls
in
1967
and
worked
several
land-based
jobs
for
other
employers.
14
years
after
he
left
ingalls,
he
was
diagnosed
with
asbestosis
in
march
of
1981.
in
april
of
1981,
he
filed
a
claim
against
ingalls
for
compensation
and
medical
benefits
under
the
longshore
act.
in
may
of
1981,
his
lawyers,
who
are
the
same
lawyers
that
represent
him
in
the
compensation
claim
against
ingalls,
filed
a
products
liability
suit
in
federal
court
in
biloxi,
mississippi,
seeking
$6
million
in
actual
and
punitive
damages
against
23
asbestos
manufacturers
who
he
claimed
made
the
asbestos
to
which
he
was
exposed
at
ingalls.
less
than
a
year
after
his
compensation
claim
was
filed
against
ingalls,
ingalls
wrote
the
district
director
for
the
sixth
compensation
district
and
accepted
his
claim,
voluntarily
accepted
his
claim,
under
the
longshore
act
and
agreed
to
pay
him
medical
benefits
and
tendered
to
him
all
benefits
under
the
longshore
act.
in
may
of--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--if
a
burnside
action
was
filed
separate
and
apart
from
the
longshore
act,
the
employer
would
be
faced...
if
the
employer
sued
the
23
asbestos
manufacturers
directly,
the
employer
would
be
faced
with
certain
common
law
defenses
in
the
burnside
tort
action,
tort
indemnity
action,
that
the
employer
would
not
be
faced
in
a
direct
action
by
the
worker
against
those
defendants
under
the
longshore
act.
for
example,
if
the
employer
filed
a
direct
suit
outside
the
longshore
act
under
the
burnside
tort
indemnity
theory,
the
defendants,
the
asbestos
manufacturers,
could
assert
certain
contributory
negligence
features
of
coworkers
of
mr.
yates
which
would
serve
to
reduce
ingalls'
recovery
against
those
asbestos
manufacturers.
more
important
than
that...
and
this
court
made
it
clear
in
bloomer...
that
an
employer
is
entitled
to
receive
back
100
percent
of
his
compensation
and
medical
benefits
plus
its
attorney's
fees.
that's
provided
by
congress
under
section
933
of
the
longshore
act.
if
an
employer
is
required,
because
of
some
wrongful
act
of
a
worker,
to
file
a
separate
burnside
tort
indemnity
lawsuit,
the
employer,
in
addition
to
being
faced
with
common
law
defenses
which
would
reduce
its
recovery
in
the
burnside
action,
would
also
be
faced
with
having
to
bear
its
own
attorney's
fees
and
cost
in
the
burnside
action
which
congress
has
made
it
clear
in
section
933(e),
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
bloomer,
that
the
employer
has
its
inviolate
right
to
have
100
percent
of
its
compensation
and
medical
benefits--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but...
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
but
the
comparison
that
i'm
making...
and
the
reason
why
congress
felt
it
so
important
for
an
employer
to
have
a
right
to
consent
to
a
third
party
settlement
is
that
after
mr.
yates
died,
mrs.
yates
and
her
adult
children...
the
next
three
settlements
that
they
entered
into
after
mr.
yates
died
were
for
$105,000.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
we're
saying.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i'm
asking
this
court
to
follow
cowart.
i'm
asking
this
court
to
find--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--that
i
think,
your
honor,
is
a
source
of
confusion
for
the
fifth
circuit.
what
this
court,
as
i
understand
cowart,
said
was
the
right
of
mr.
cowart
to
recover
compensation
arose
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
not
at
the
time
that
the
employer
acknowledged
liability
under
the
act
and
not
at
the
time
that
he
was
found
entitled
to
adjudication
under
the
act.
this
court
found
in
cowart,
as
i
understand
cowart,
that
his
right
to
recover
compensation
arose
when
his
injury
arose.
and
we
are
simply
saying
that
that
principle
should
hold
true
for
those
claiming
through
mr.
cowart,
that
the
right
of
the
worker
and
the
right
of
those
claiming
through
the
worker
arising...
arises
at
the
time
of
the
worker's
injury.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
i
think
it's
very
consistent
with
cowart,
your
honor.
i
think
what's...
what
the
argument
that
the
director
has
posed
in
the
courts
below
and
i
think
the
source
of
confusion
is
to
take
the
vesting
language
out
of
cowart,
take
it
in
vacuo,
and
ignore
this
court's
holding
that
mr.
cowart
became
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
at
the
time
of
his
injury.
the
fact
that
a
wife
of
a
worker
may
divorce,
the
fact
that
a
wife
of
a
worker
may
die
before
her
husband
becomes
an
irrelevant
fact,
if
that
happens,
insofar
as
the
employer
is
concerned
because
if
the
wife
divorces
or
if
the
wife
predeceases
the
husband,
then
her
unapproved
third
party
settlements
for
less
than
a
compensation
she
would
be
entitled
against
the
employer
would
not
prejudice
the
employer
because
she
would
not
have
a
claim
against
that
employer.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
here
is
that
mrs.
yates
entered
into
these
unauthorized
third
party
settlements.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
your
honor,
she
became
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
at
the
same
time
that
her
husband
became
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
prejudice
to
the
employer
would
not
be
there
if
she
died.
she
would
not
have
the
death
claim
against
the
employer.
her
third
party--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--no,
sir.
there
would
be
no
prejudice
to
the
employer
until
she
claimed
compensation
by
virtue
of
the
occupational
disease
to
her
husband.
she
became
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
at
the
same
time
as
her
husband
when
he
was
diagnosed
with
an
occupational
disease.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
no,
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--well,
the
purpose...
if
these
questions
are
asked
without
consideration
to
the
reason
that
33(g)
was
enacted
by
congress--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
arguing
the
majority
opinion
in
cowart
and
that
is--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--that
is
the
plain
language.
the
plain
language
that
was...
i
believe
the
court
was
referring
to
in
cowart
was
not
the
phrase,
person
entitled
to
compensation.
the
plain
language
that
the
court
was
referring
to
in
cowart,
as
i
understand
cowart,
was
the
1984
amendments
where
they...
where
congress
added
the
language
that
if
you
don't...
if
a
worker
does
not
receive
an
employer's
consent
to
a
third
party
settlement,
then
he
is
bound
by
the
forfeiture
provisions
of
33(g)
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
has
paid
compensation
or
whether
or
not
the
employer
has
acknowledged
liability.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that
operative
clause
i
believe
was
considered
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
the
addition
by
congress
in
1984
that
they
are
barred
regardless
of
whether
the
employer
makes
the
payments
or
acknowledges
liability.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
be
strictly
based
on
tort
indemnity.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
it's
a
state
law
cause
of
action,
your
honor.
it's
been
recognized
by
the
federal
courts
in
burnside
to
be
a
tort
indemnity.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
i
think
that
representing
a
third
party
asbestos
manufacturer
that
settles
out
from
under
an
employer
without
that
employer's
consent
runs
the
risk
of
paying
twice.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
well,
but,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
policing
mechanism
would
be
the
burnside--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--the
third
party
and
the
worker
would
be
well
advised
to
seek
approval.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--your
honor,
i
believe
you're
absolutely
right
on
the
nature
of
the
spousal
claim,
but
i
believe
that
you
will
see
under
the
longshore
act
that
a
claim
for
disability
by
a
worker
is
purely
economic.
he
can
have
an
occupational
disease
that's
progressive
in
nature
and
continue
to
work
where
that
disease
does
not--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct.
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
cretan
found
just
that.
they
recognized
that
the
phrase,
quote,
person
entitled
to
compensation,
was
not
defined
by
congress
in
the
longshore
act.
they
recognized
that
person
entitled
to
compensation
was
capable
of
several
different
interpretations,
but
the
interpretation
that
the
courts
must
give
to
the
phrase
is
in
the
context
of
the
reason
that
the
statute
is
there
in
the
first
place.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
no,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
very
important
point.
that's
why
we
say
that
the
rights
of
both
the
worker
and
those
claiming
through
the
worker
arises
at
the
time
of
his
injury.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
it's
section...
it's
the
dependency
provision
of
the
longshore
act
that
says
that
it's
only
the
dependents
of
the
worker
at
the
time
of
his
injury--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--that
are
entitled
to
recover
under
the
longshore
act.
and
that's
why
the
longshore
act
is
all
based
on
the...
all
rights
of
the
injured
worker
and
his
family,
as
well
as
all
liabilities
of
the
employer,
begin
at
the
moment
of
the
injury
not
when
he's...
the
worker
is
adjudicated
entitled
to
compensation
and
not
when
he
dies
before
his
wife.
the
longshore
act
states
that
the
worker's
rights
and
his
average
weekly
wage
upon
which
his
compensation
is
based
occurs
at
the
time
of
his
injury.
it
says
that
all
questions
of
dependency,
that
is,
those
who
are
ultimately
entitled
to
recover
under
the
longshore
act
in
the
event
the
worker
dies
from
an
employment-related
problem...
those
rights
of
dependencies
are
determined
at
the
time
of
his
injury
not
at
the
time
of
his
death.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct.
they
have
to
be
primarily...
well,
solely.
the
operative
part
is
dependent
at
the
time
of
his
injury.
if
he
were
to
die
and
he
had
other
dependents
that
were
not
dependents
of
his
at
the
time
of
the
injury...
for
example,
if
he
divorced
his
existing
wife
at
the
time
of
the
injury
and
then
remarried
immediately
prior
to
his
death,
that
wife,
that
surviving
wife,
would
not
be
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
longshore
act.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
you
know,
last
night,
your
honor,
i
was
thinking
about
that,
and
looking
at
the
purpose
for
which
that
statute
is
there,
that
same
thought
occurred
to
me
because
congress
could
well...
congress
speaks
in
terms
of
933(a)
which
says
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
need
not
elect
his
remedy.
he
can
sue
both
in
tort
and
he
can
seek
compensation
benefits
provided
those
benefits,
those
compensation
benefits,
are
for
more
than
what
he's
recovered
under
the
third
party.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
well,
no,
your
honor.
i
think,
as
i
read
the
statute,
as
i
understand
the
statute,
the
person
entitled
to
compensation...
the
status
of
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
longshore
act
would
make
that
person
responsible
for
meeting
the
employer
approval
requirements
of
section
933(g).
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
well,
i'm
really...
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you,
your
honor.
it
may
be
just
because
i've
lost
your
question,
but
i
think--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--well,
i
was
thinking
the
same
thing
in
the
context
that
a
person
entitled
to
compensation...
i
think
congress
was
looking
at
it
in
the
context--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--well,
i
mean
the
section
933(g)
speaks
in
terms
of
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
having
to
comply
with
the
employer
approval
requirement.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
it
means
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
act.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
it
is
clear,
your
honor,
and
you're
correct.
and
i
believe
that
if
the
court...
the
court
has
to
apply
the
same
interpretation
to
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
under
933(a),
933(g),
and
933(f).
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
it
is
shown--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--no,
sir.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that
was
the
dissent
in
cowart.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
it
must
encompass--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--if
the
purpose
of
section
33
is
to
be
accepted
by
this
court,
33(g)
would
apply
to
every
worker
and
those
claiming
through
that
worker
who
file
a
claim
for
compensation
under
the
longshore
act,
if
they
settle
for
less
than
the
compensation
they're
entitled
third
party
without
the
consent
of
the
employer,
they
come
within
the
requirements
and
allegations
of
section
33(g).
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
was.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
sure.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
well...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
well,
if
it...
the
effect
would
be
the
same
if
it's...
i
guess
the
criteria
would
be
based
upon
her
age,
her
husband's
age,
his
average
weekly
wage,
other
factors
that
enter
into
the
compensation
liability
for
both
the
husband
and
the
wife.
when
it's
all
said
and
done,
when
the
injury
to
the
worker
occurs,
that
employer's
compensation
liability
is
fixed
at
that
point.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
even
as
to
the
wife.
that's
correct.
the
only
difference
is
is
that
when
the
husband
dies,
the
payments
to
him
stop
and
the
employer
starts
paying
the
wife.
i
mean,
that's
the
only
change
that's
occurred.
there's
some
difference
in
the
amount
that's
paid,
but
the
employer's
obligations
is
fixed
at
the
time.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
yes,
depending
on
the
number
of
children
that
there
are.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
yes.
there
are
different
factors
such
as
age,
the
compensation
rate
that's
being
paid,
the
number
of
children
she
has,
that
sort
of
thing.
very
quickly...
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
very
quickly,
the
second
issue
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted.
it
was
our
position,
in
follow-up
to
this
court's
opinion
in
the
newport
news
case,
is
that
the
director
of
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs
has
no
standing
to
participate
actively
in
this
appeal.
we
would
submit
that
section
921(c)
of
the
longshore
act
only
vests
into
persons
who
are
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
by
a
decision
the
right
to
appeal
a
case
to
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals.
congress
has
defined
person
in
the
longshore
act
as
not
to
include
the
director
or
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
director
and
secretary
of
labor
have
no
financial
stake
in
this
case.
there
is
no
regulation
of
the
director...
there's
no
function
of
the
director
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
it's
strictly
a
private
dispute
involving
a
private
compensation
claim
between
a
worker
and
his
family
and
the
employer.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
very
important--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--your
honor,
that's
the
first
thing
i
was
going
to
address.
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
the
act
provides
that
it's
the
wife
of
the
worker
at
the
time
of
his
injury
that
is
entitled
to
compensation
at
his
death.
if
he
was
not
married
at
the
time
of
his
injury
or
if
he
changed
wives
at
the
time...
before
the
time
of
his
death,
that
wife
that
married
the
worker
after
his
injury
would
not
be
entitled
to
compensation.
only
the
wife
married
to
him
at
the
time
of
the
injury
would
be
entitled
to
compensation.
if
the
court
holds,
as
the
government
and
as
the
respondents
want
the
court
to
hold,
it
would
mean
that
no
employer
would
be
entitled
to
any
credit
for
any
third
party
recoveries
made
by
a
wife
when
she
releases
her
wrongful
death
claims
during
the
lifetime
of
her
husband.
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
credit--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
benefits
review
board
since
1991
have
changed
their
position
on
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
four
times:
one
in
force
v.
director,
one
before
the
fifth
circuit
in
cowart.
they
again
changed
their
position
before
this
court
after
certiorari
was
granted
in
cowart,
and
now
they
change
their
position
for
the
fourth
time
in
this
case.
we
think
it's
very
important
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
as
we
did
in
the
briefing,
that
the
director
has
passed
a
regulation
which
is
section
20
c.f.r.
702.281
that
says
that
the
employer
approval
requirements
of
section
33(g)
and
the
employer
credit
entitlements
under
section
33(f)
shall
apply
to
every
person
claiming
benefits
under
this
act.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
employer
says,
i
won't
approve
the
settlement,
she
is
guaranteed
compensation
from
the
employer
under
the
longshore
act.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
the
whole
thing.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
no,
your
honor.
if
she
notifies
the
employer
and
says
i
have
a
third
party
settlement
for
less
than
the
compensation
i'm
entitled,
and
the
employer
says
no,
and
she
settles
regardless,
under
33(g)
she
would
be
barred.
but
if
she
says,
okay,
i
won't
accept
the
third
party
settlement,
then
the
very
least
she
would
get
would
be
her
full
compensation
under
the
longshore
act.
that's
the
least
she
would
get.
all
they
have
to
do
is
come
to
the
employer
and
say,
i
have
a
third
party
settlement.
it
may
be
for
more,
it
may
be
for
less.
will
you
approve
it?
if
the
employer
does
not
approve
it
and
she
does
not
accept
the
third
party
settlement,
the
very
minimum
she
would
get--
mr.
richard
p.
salloum
--thank
you,
your
honor.
