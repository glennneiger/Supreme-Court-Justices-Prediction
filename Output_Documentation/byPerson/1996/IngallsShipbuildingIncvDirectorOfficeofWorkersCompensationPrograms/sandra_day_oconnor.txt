mr.
salloum,
may
i
get
you
to...
salloum,
may
i
get
you
to
clarify
for
me
how
the
employer
is
injured
here?
now,
i
assume
the
employer
could
file
suit
against
those
third
parties
who
were
at
fault
for
the
employee's
injuries
to
recover
payments
that
you...
the
employer
made...
may
have
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
say
you
might
not
be
made
whole
or
as
whole
as
you
would
be
otherwise.
how
about
recovering
monies
that
you
pay
to
mrs.
yates
out
of
the
post-death
settlements?
yes,
ma'am.
your
honor,
ingalls
approved
the
post-death
settlements.
and
i
think
the
classic
example
of
that
and
why
section
933(g)
and
section
933(f)
are
so
important
is
that
after
ingalls
accepted
mr.
yates'
claim
in
june
of
1992
and
agreed
to
pay
him
lifetime
benefits
under
the
longshore
act,
mr.
yates
and
mrs.
yates
between
1982,
when
ingalls
accepted
the
claim,
and
1986
when
he
died,
entered
into
four
settlements
with
asbestos
manufacturers
in
that
third
party
case
which
mrs.
yates
released
her
wrongful
death
claims
for
mr.
yates
during
his
lifetime.
a
classic
example
of
that
is
that
those
four
settlements
that
were
entered
into
between
the
time
ingalls
accepted
the
claim
and
the
time
mr.
yates
died
where
she
released
her
wrongful
death
claims
totaled
$30,000,
which
were
much
less--
--and
that
money
is
not
recoverable
by
the
employer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
know,
what
you're
basically
saying
is
that
the
rule
should
kick
in
once
the
employer
starts
making
payments,
but
that's
not...
it's
not
consistent
with
our
holding
in
estate
of
cowart
which
said
a
person
satisfies
the
prerequisites
attached
to
the
right
and
thus
becomes
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
at
the
moment
the
right
to
recovery
is
vested,
that
is,
at
the
time
of
the
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
think
we've
kind
of
decided
cowart
and
relatively
recently.
are
you
asking
us
to
reverse
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
if
we
followed
cowart,
we
would
have
to
say
that
mrs.
yates
was
not
entitled
or
qualified
for
a
benefit
until
her
husband's
death.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
think
that
cowart
would
make
mrs.
yates
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
as
soon
as
he
knew
he
had
been
exposed
to
asbestos?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
they
might
divorce.
she
might
predecease
him.
i
didn't
think
that
was
consistent
with
cowart,
but
you
think
it
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
children
presumably
are
not
beneficiaries
if
they
have
reached
majority
at
the
time
of
death?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
wouldn't
know
at
the
time
of
exposure
to
asbestos
whether
the
children
would
ever
be
eligible.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
that
position
is
inconsistent,
is
it
not,
with
the
rule
that
was
promulgated
after
the
'84
amendments?
didn't
the
director
take
the
position
at
that
time
that
coverage
of
a
death
claim
does
not
turn
on
when
death
is
sustained?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
the
time
of
the
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
newport
news
case?
it
surely
points
in
the
other
direction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
tax
court...
when
we
get
cases
that
originated
in
the
tax
court,
is
the
tax
court
a
party
before
us?
