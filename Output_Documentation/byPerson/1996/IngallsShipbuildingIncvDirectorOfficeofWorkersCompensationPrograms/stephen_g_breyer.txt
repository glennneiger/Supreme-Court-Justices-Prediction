justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
technical,
very
general
questions
that
are...
probably
have
a
clear
answer?
is
it...
suppose
you're
a
covered
employer
and
i'm
a
covered
employee
and
i'm
exposed
to
a
cancer-causing
substance
that
might
or
might
not
cause
cancer
10
years
hence.
now,
if
i
leave
your
employ
later
on
and
i
do
get
the
cancer,
i'm
covered.
right?
from
you,
not
from
some
other
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
my
second
question
is
that
in
the
language
in
question,
i
would
have
thought
reading
it
naturally,
though
i
don't...
this
i
guess
is
decided...
that
it
seems
to
apply
to
an
employer
who
is
paying
out
to
an
employee
some
money
under
this
statute
and
they
have
6
months,
the
employee,
to
go
and
sue,
and
then
thereafter
you
have
90
days
to
bring
your
own
lawsuit
if
i
don't.
and
it
says
as
to...
and
i'm
trying
to
get
an
idea
of
the
purpose
of
that
under
that
incorrect
interpretation.
but
that
being
so,
the
purpose
of...
why
do
i
have
to
go
to
the
employer
to
get
his
approval
because,
after
all,
if
i
settle
for
$1,
what
difference
does
it
make?
you,
the
employer,
can
go
bring
you
own
lawsuit
against
the
third
party
and
get
all
the
money
back
that
you
had
to
pay
me,
can't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
is
that
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i
got
that
one.
all
right.
now,
then
the
next
thing
that...
and
i
take
it
you're
arguing
this,
that
once
we
reject
the
interpretation
of
the
natural
reading
of
the
words,
that
we're
thinking
of
the
pay-out
case.
then
i
can't
find
any
basis
hypothetically...
i'm
not
saying
really...
but
i
can't...
what
is
the
basis
for
distinguishing
between
everybody
in
the
world
who
might
be
hurt
working
for
you?
that
is,
why
does
a
person...
what's
the...
how
would
you
interpret
these
words?
once
you
say
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
is
not
the
person
who
has
passed
the
starting
gate,
i.e.,
the
starting
gate
when
you
start
to
pay
me,
then
is
it
your
view
that
then
covers
anyone
who
ever
will
be,
will
be,
or
is
now
entitled
to
compensation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
saying
your
view
is
there's
no
way
of
drawing
a
line
short
of
that.
the
dissent
in
cowart,
which
was
i
take
it
the
position
i
said
wasn't
the
law,
which
i
take
it...
is
that
right,
the
dissent
in
cowart
is
focusing
on
those
people
who
are
the
people
you're
actually
beginning
to
pay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
once
you're
past
that
position,
once
you're
saying
that's
no
good
anymore,
then
it
must
encompass
anybody
who's
hurt--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--working
for
you
i
mean,
you
know,
who
might
eventually
be
entitled
to
compensation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
that
she
could?
if...
suppose
33(f)
and
(g)
don't
apply
because
she's
not
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
then
how
does
she
get
any
money?
she
just
gets
it
directly
under
7,
8,
and
9...
907,
8,
and
9,
the
basic
requirement?
is
that
how
she
gets
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
she
entitled
to
that,
whereas
the
worker
who...
let's
say
the
ordinary
case.
the
worker
is
hurt.
he's
paid
out
his
paycheck.
within
6
months,
he
wants
to
file
a
lawsuit.
the
classic,
ordinary
case.
he
goes
to
the
employer.
the
employer
says
i'm
not
going
to
approve
this
settlement.
why
is
that
worker
not
entitled
to
the
basic
compensation?
the
statute
says
if
the
worker
won't
approve
the
settlement
under
(g),
that
he's
not
entitled
to
the
(f)
compensation.
it
doesn't
say
a
word
about
the
basic
compensation.
so,
that's
what
i...
do
you
see...
i'm
having
trouble
understanding
if
we
hold
with
you
on
this,
are
we
certain
these
people
are
going
to
be
compensated
at
all?
and
if
they're
compensated,
why
isn't
the
ordinary
person
compensated
when
the
employer
refuses
to
approve
the
settlement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
everyone
whom...
if
an
employer
refuses
to
sign,
the
employer
has
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
compensation
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anyway,
and
that's
with
an
ordinary
worker
who
is
hurt
and
they're
paying
out
paychecks...
paying
out
compensation
checks.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
based
on
disability.
they
have
to...
either
they
sign
and
they
get
the
reduction
of
933,
or
they
don't
sign
and
they
have
to
pay
the
full
thing.
that's
the
employer's
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
one
final
question
and
that
is
this.
given
your
answers
to
what
i've
asked,
then
what
harm
is
done
if
you
in
fact
interpret
the
statute
the
way
your
opponents
want
if
you
say
it
applies
to
everybody
once
they're
hurt
and
could
become
entitled
to
compensation?
because
then
those
people,
whenever
they
sue,
go
and
try
to
enter
into
a
settlement.
if
the
employer
approves
the
settlement,
the
woman
or
man
is
fine.
if
the
employer
doesn't
approve
the
settlement,
the
woman
or
man
eventually
will
get
their
full
compensation
when
the
disability
turns
up
and
hurts
them.
so,
what
harm
is
done?
and
the
good
would
be
it
makes
sense
administratively,
you
know,
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
to
my
question.
i
don't
understand.
if
she
goes
and
tries
to
get
the
settlement,
like
any
other
worker,
if
the
employer
approves
it,
she
gets
the
settlement.
no
problem.
suppose
the
employer
disapproves
it.
at
that
point
i
thought
you
said
that
he
or
she
or
anyone
would
be
entitled
to
ordinary
compensation
under
906,
7,
8,
and
9,
the
rest
of
the
act.
is
that
not
so
or
is
it
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
if
there
had
never
been
a
settlement,
she
was...
would
have
been
entitled
to
compensation
under
some
provision
of
the
act
other
than
933(f).
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there
had
never
been
any
settlement
at
all,
there
never
was
a
settlement
offer,
your
client
would
have
been
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
act,
but
not
933,
some
other
provisions
of
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
not
933(f),
some
other
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
of
course,
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
there
is
a
settlement
and
it
requires
approval--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
she
didn't
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
did.
suppose
you
lost
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
applied
and
she
didn't
get
it.
why
isn't
she
still
entitled
to
compensation
under
those
same
other
provisions
since
(g)
only
blocks
compensation
under
(f)?
(g)
only
applies
to
not
getting
compensation
under
(f).
it
doesn't
apply
to
not
getting
compensation
at
all.
so,
why
isn't
she
still
entitled
to
compensation
under
all
the
other
provisions?
that's
what
i've
been
unable
to
figure
out,
and
for
whatever
reasons
i
won't
go
into
that
would
help
me
to
understand
that
how
the
statute
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
the
employer
just
say
no?
if
the
employer
says,
no,
i
won't
approve
the
settlement...
he
says,
no...
then
the
woman
never
gets
any
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
if
the
employer
says,
no,
i
won't
approve
the
settlement,
the
employer
has
to
pay
the
whole
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so,
if
she
notifies
the
employer,
she
just
notifies
the
employer,
and
at
that
point
the
employer
says,
no,
she
gets
all
the
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
employer
says,
no,
she
gets
ordinary
compensation.
