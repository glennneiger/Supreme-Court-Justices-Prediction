mr.
salloum,
i'll
ask
what
may
be
an
embarrassing
question
but
it
goes
to
the
reason
that
i'm
not
following
your
argument.
you
say
that
the...
in
effect,
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
wife
becomes
entitled
or
the
spouse
becomes
entitled
at
the
same
time
as
the
injured
party,
and
you
say
that's
the
moment
of
injury.
i
thought
the
distinction
was
that,
in
essence,
the
claim
of
the
immediately
injured
party
arises
because
the
injury
is
physical,
whereas
the
claim
of
the
spouse
arises
later
because
the
injury
is
economic
and
it
does
not
occur
until
the
support
or
the
right
to
support
is
eliminated
in
this
case
by
the
death.
am
i...
do
i
misunderstand
the
nature
of
the
spousal
claim
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
so,
you're
saying
if
one
economic
injury
arises
at
the
moment
of
physical
injury,
the
other
one
does
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
with
that
in
mind,
what
if...
taking
the
earlier
example
in
which
the
spouse
dies
or
is
divorced
before
the
injured
party's
date...
the
primary
injured
party's
date
of
death,
if
the
injured
party
marries
again,
does
the
new
spouse
have
any
claim
following
death?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
your
authority
for
that
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
at
the
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
is
your
answer
or
is
the
dispositive
character
of
your
answer
affected
by
the
fact
that
the
claim
against
the
third
party
is
not
or
need
not
be
purely
economic?
or
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
claim...
if
the
harbor
worker
brought
a
claim
against
the
third
party,
it
would
not
be
limited
to
economic.
justice
david
h.
souter
whereas
if
the
spouse
later
brings
one,
it
would
be
limited
to
economic.
and
is
the...
does
the
statute...
when
the
statute
refers
to
entitlement,
is
it
talking
about
entitlement
as
against
the
third
party
as
opposed
to
entitlement
as
against
the
employer?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
entitlement
refers
to,
in
effect,
a
general
tort
law
entitlement,
then
your
argument
would
fail,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
right,
but
if
entitlement
to
compensation
is
really...
or
if
the
entitlement
that
the
statute
speaks
of
is
making
reference
to
the
tort
liability,
then
there
would
be
no
entitlement
on
the
part
of
the
spouse
prior
to
the
death
of
the
harbor
worker.
and
therefore,
you
would
lose.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
will
the
timing
of
his
death
affect
the
amount
of
her
entitlement?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
what
i
think
justice
stevens
was
getting
at.
how
could
we
figure
it?
