mr.
wynn
e.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
asking
the
court
to
follow
cowart,
a
decision
decided
4
short
years
ago,
which
we
submit
teaches
us
three
things.
one,
in
the
words
of
cowart,
there's
a
basic
and
unexceptional
rule
that
when
a
statute
speaks
clearly
to
a
subject,
judicial
inquiry
is
no
longer
warranted,
and
that
statute,
section
33--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--yes,
sir,
but
interpretation
beyond
the
clear
meaning
of
the
statute
is
what
i'm
referring
to.
cowart
teaches
us
two
other
things,
and
it's
right
there
on
page
2594
of
the
supreme
court
reporter
and
page
2595.
cowart
teaches
us
that
a...
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
status
must
be
measured
at
the
time
of
the
third
party
settlements,
and
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
settlements
made
before
mrs.
yates
became
a
widow,
at
the
time
she
had
no
right
to
invoke
the
administrative
machinery
of
the
longshore
act
to
file
a
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
claim
for
death
benefits.
cowart
teaches
us
a
third
thing,
and
it
says
this
on
page
2595.
it
says
that
person
entitled
to
the
compensation
means
this,
that
the
person
satisfies
the
prerequisites
for
the
right.
there
are
a
couple
of
misstatements
that
i
believe
are
just
simply
wrong
that
have
made--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--with
respect
to
the
pre-death
settlements,
all
parties
were
then
operating
under
the
dorsey
and
o'leary
cases
out
of
the
benefits
review
board,
and
they're
cited
in
cowart.
and
those
cases
said,
which
is
something
that
cowart
made
short
work
of,
was
that
you
have
to
be
receiving
compensation
at
the
time
in
order
to
be
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
that's
why
there
was
no
problem
at
that
time.
i
might
add
too--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--yes,
but
they're
still
under
the
category
of
pre-death
settlements,
settlements
made
during
the
lifetime
of
mr.
cowart,
the
traumatically
injured
worker...
excuse
me...
occupationally
injured
worker.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
none
of
the
pre-death
settlements
were
approved.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
no
approval
was
sought,
and
may
i
add
that
no--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--no
approval
was
required,
and
it's
right
there
in
the
petitioners'
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
pages
49
and
48
and
62
and
63,
is
because
33(g)(1)
only
applies
when
the,
quote,
person
entitled
to
compensation,
end
of
quote,
settles
for
an
amount
less
than
the
compensation
to
which
he
was
entitled.
there
was
a
section
8(i)
settlement
in
may,
may
5,
1983,
which
determined
that
the
petitioner
ingalls
paid
mr.
cowart...
excuse
me...
mr.
yates
$15,000
and
kept
his
medical
benefits
open.
at
that
point
he
knew...
every...
all
the
parties
knew...
what
he
was
entitled
to
under
the
act.
the
third
party
settlements...
and
we're
talking
about
the
pre-death
settlements...
netted
$18,000
plus,
and
correctly
the
benefits
review
board
in
the...
at
the
pages
i
cite
in
the
appendix
noted
that
approval
wasn't
even
required
from
mr.
yates,
much
less
mrs.
yates
who
could
never
have
invoked
the
administrative
machinery
of
the
act
during
the
lifetime
of
her
husband
on--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--justice
scalia,
you
look
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
under
cowart
to
determine
person
entitled
to
compensation
status.
to
determine
actuarial--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--to
determine
actuarial
for
the
claim
that
mrs.
yates
is
advancing,
which
is
a
mix
and
match
approach
for
the
petitioners,
you
do
it
after
the
husband
has
died
and
she
at
that
time
files
a
claim
for
compensation.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
you
look
at
it
when
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
makes
a
third
party
settlement.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
correct,
yes,
sir.
you
have
to
be
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
first.
then
there's
the
third
party
settlement,
and
then
you
look
actuarial.
and
in
this
case--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--well,
he...
both
the
party...
the
actuarial
determination
would
have
to
be
made
by
the
administrative
judge
in
the
formal
hearing
and
if
either
party...
yes,
they
can
appeal.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
yes.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
i
don't
i
think
i
follow
your
question.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
my
client
would
have
been
entitled
to
compensation
under
section
9
of
the
longshore
act
for
death
benefits.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
of
course,
not.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
yes.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
it
requires--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--may
i
be
precise?
it
requires
approval
if
settlement
is
less
for
the
compensation--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--for
which
she--
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
--i
believe
the
shorthand
answer
to
that
is,
one
is
that
section
33(g)(2)
says
that
failure
to
obtain
a
prior
written
consent
from
the
employer
and
carrier
terminates
or
forfeits
your
rights
to
compensation
and
medical
benefits.
and
number
two,
the
answer
is
that
cowart
decided
that
issue
adversely
to
the
position
that
i
think
the
situation
you're
addressing.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
basically
in
the
dissent.
the
point
is,
if
you
look
in...
and
it's
right
there
in
our
briefs,
pages
12
through
18.
it
basically
says
this,
that
even
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
witthuhn
case
cited
in
our
brief
says...
and
they
use
the
words
vest...
that
a
widow's
claim
for
death
benefits
under
section
9
vest
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
worker
on
whom
she
is
dependent.
and
to
address
justice
ginsburg's
question
a
moment
ago
with
some
of
the
other
counsel,
it
is
possible...
and
it's
on
page
21
of
the
director's
brief.
it
is
possible
for
a
wife
to
be
living
separate
and
apart
under
section
9
from
her
husband
at
the
time
of
death
as
long
as
it's
not
due
to
her
fault
and
not
be
dependent
and
still
be
entitled
to
section
9
benefits.
think
of
the
things
that
could
have
prevented
mrs.
yates
from
ever
being
entitled
to
compensation:
death.
she
may
have
predeceased
mr.
yates,
and
mrs.
yates
today
is
88
years
old.
mr.
wynn
e.
clark
yes,
sir,
you
could.
but
what
i'm
referring
to
now
is
why,
consistent
with
the
cases
cited
in
my
brief
on
page
12
though
18,
which
go
directly
opposing...
opposed
to
what
the
petitioner
is
advancing
here.
as
i
understood
it,
they
said
that
her
entitlement...
entitlement...
arose
at
the
same
time
as
mr.
yates'
diagnosis
with
asbestosis,
which
is--
