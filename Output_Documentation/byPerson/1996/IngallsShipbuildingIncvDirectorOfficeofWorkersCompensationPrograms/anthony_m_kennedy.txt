well,
but
the
operative
clause
there
was
again
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
something
about
the
burnside
action
or
actions
like
that.
if
the
employer...
if
there's
a
settlement
with
a
third
party,
and
the
employer
then
sues
the
third
party,
does
the
employer
have
a
cause
of
action
on
the
grounds
that
the
settlement
was
somehow
inadequate,
or
is
it
it
just
seeks
indemnity
based
on
the
fault
of
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that's
a
state
law
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
third
party
has
no
duty
to
make
an
adequate
settlement,
no
duty
that
runs
to
the
employer?
it's
just
a
strict
indemnity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
breech
by
entering
into
a
settlement
that
deprives
the
employer
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
if
that's
true,
then
the
act
does
have
a
policing
mechanism.
it's
not
without
teeth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
policing
will
be
i
guess
the
third
party.
the
third
party
would
be
well
advised
to
seek
approval.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
clear
that
if
we
rule,
as
you
suggest,
and
the
wife
in
this
case
is
not
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
at
the
time
she
makes
the
settlement...
is
it
true
that
when
she
does
become
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
and
brings
a
suit
against
the
employer,
that
the
employer
cannot
offset
under
33(f)?
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
here,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
at
least
an
open
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
was
talking
about
offset
for
the
previous--
