yes,
but
the
question
that...
i'm
still
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer
because
the
question
is,
when
did
she
become
a
person
entitled
to
compensation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
next
day
she
died.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
would...
there
would
be
no
prejudice
to
the
employer
unless
she
later
became
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
supposing
she
did
get
a
settlement
of
her
contingent
claim
later
on
and
then
she
died
before
he
did
but
she
had
that
money,
you
know,
tucked
away.
she
got
a
settlement
with
the
third
party.
would
the
employer
be
prejudiced
at
all
in
that
circumstance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
wasn't
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
sound
like
you're
arguing
the
dissent
in
cowart.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
very
plain
language,
strictly
literal
interpretation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do,
could
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
pre...
when
the
wife
settles
before
the
husband
dies
and
asks
for
approval
of
the
settlement,
how
does...
how
do
you
decide
whether
she
must
ask
for
approval?
because
it's
only
if
the
settlement
is
for
less
than
the
amount
she's
entitled
to,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
say
that
she's
entitled
to
anything
more
than
zero
at
that
time
when
she
asks
for
the
settlement
to
be
approved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
how...
what
is
the
standard
by
which
you
know
the
duty
to
ask
for
approval
of
the
settlement
arises?
in
other
words,
it's
less
than
she's
entitled
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
to...
even
as
to
the
wife.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
difference
is
that
the
wife
gets
less
than
the
husband?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
she's...
it
seems
to
me
there
are
variables
in
there.
well,
anyway,
i
don't
want
to
prevent
you
from
addressing
the
other
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
very
much
puzzled
by
that,
exactly
what
is
the
standard
that
determines
her
duty
to
seek
approval
of
a
settlement
that
arguably
is
less
than
she
might
become
entitled
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me.
had
you
finished
your
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i?
what
about
the
case
in
which
the
worker
becomes
entitled
to
compensation
either
because
it's
clear
the
injury
is
disabling
or
you
fix
the
point
of
disability
and
he
marries
someone
later?
does
that
later-acquired
wife
possibly
get
widow's
benefits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you
wouldn't
know...
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
identify
the
universe
of
people
later
entitled
to
compensation
even
at
the
time
of
injury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
was
the
rule
for
12
years
prior
to
cowart,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
the
rule
that
was
generally
applied
for
12
years
prior
to
cowart,
wasn't
it,
by
the
benefit
review
board?
