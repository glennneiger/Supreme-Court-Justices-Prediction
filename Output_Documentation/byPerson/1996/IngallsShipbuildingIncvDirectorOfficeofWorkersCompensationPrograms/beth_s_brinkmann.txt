ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
questions
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
first
question
concerning
the
correct
interpretation
of
section
33(g)
is
answered
by
the
text
and
this
court's
interpretation
of
that
text
in
the
estate
of
cowart
case.
the
court
there
held
that
under
the
plain
language
of
section
33(g),
the
term
person
entitled
to
compensation
means
a
person
who
satisfies
the
prerequisites
attached
to
the
right
to
longshore
act
compensation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
in
this
particular
case,
when
you
look
at
the
structure
of
33(g),
there
are
many
reasons
why
this
cannot
be
interpreted
to
someone
who
has
a
potential
entitlement.
first
of
all,
there
are
many
prerequisites
that
mrs.
yates
would
have
to
meet
in
order
to
become
eligible.
and
i
think
this
is
what
justice
stevens
was
getting
at.
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
a
person
who's
actually
entitled
to
compensation
is
in
a
very
different
situation
than
mrs.
yates
for
example.
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
would
be
entitled,
not
only
would
her
husband
have
to
die,
she
would
have
to
outlive
him,
they
would
still
have
to
be
married
at
that
time,
and
his
death
would
have
to
be
caused
by
the
work-related
injury.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
they--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--exactly.
in
fact,
when
you
project
out
a...
what
a
person
entitled
to...
what
a
person
would
be
entitled
to
under
the
act,
you
can
project
out
on
an
actuarial
table
the
life
expectancy
of
the
worker,
but
for
someone
not
yet
entitled,
you
would
also
have
to
find
some
way
to
project
the
likelihood
of
the
employee's
death
resulting
from
the
work-related
injury,
the
likelihood--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--actually,
the
widow...
the
wife
does
not
have
to
be
dependent
in
fact
if
she's
married
and
living
with--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
correct.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
i'd
have
to
say
no,
and
i
really
want
to
correct
i
think
a
premise
that
was
underlined
in
the
earlier
argument.
the
worker's
right
to
entitlement
is
based
on
disability,
not
injury.
so,
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
that
is
not
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
it's
only
when
that
injury
becomes
disabling,
it
affects
the
worker's
urge--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--wage
earning...
thank
you...
capacity
does
that
person
become
entitled
to
compensation.
so,
under
that
interpretation,
any
employee
that
was
ever
injured
might
be
entitled
to
compensation
if
they're
eventually
disabled
by
that.
i
think
that
there
are--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--at
the
time
of
death,
you
would
be
able
to
tell
whether
or
not
she
was
the
spouse
at
the
time
of
death.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
believe
that's
right,
your
honor.
also--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
i
believe
so
if
that
is
the
fact
at
the
time
of
death.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct.
there
are
actually
myriad
examples,
adopted
children,
children
that
are
in
utero.
there
are
a
multitude,
and
that's
why
the
words
person
entitled
to
compensation
have
a
fixed
meaning
we
believe.
and
we
believe
it
would
be...
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
distinguish
people
who
were
actually
entitled
to
compensation
from
those
who
were
not
for
two...
at
least
three
reasons.
one
is
because
of
the
calculus
of
the
comparison
of
the
amount
of
entitlement
to
the
settlement.
it's
just
an
incredibly
complex
and
very
speculative
determination.
but
in
addition,
the
person
settling
the
case
is
in
a
different
position.
if
the
person
is
entitled
to
compensation,
they
have
an
option
and
a
right
to
file
a
claim
for
disability
benefits
under
the
act,
and
what
section
933
addresses
is
a
person
who,
on
account
of
a
disability
or
death,
has
a
right
to
payment
of
some
compensation
under
the
act.
and
it
addressed
whether
or
not
that
person
had
to
choose
between
the
options.
this
person
at
the
time
of
the
settlement,
mrs.
yates,
had
no
right
to
file
a
claim
and
indeed
may
never
have
one.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
under
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i
think
if
i'm
understanding
you
correctly,
my
answer
is
that
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
does
recover.
either
they
settle
and
get
the
settlement
amount
or
they
don't
settle
and
they
have
their
entitlement
to
rights
under
the
act.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
they
have
to
pay
the
compensation
that
the
person
is
entitled
to
under
the
act.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
based
on
disability.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
are
many
other
choices,
as
people
have
already
mentioned.
there's,
of
course,
the
burnside
action
that
the
employer
can
recover
from
a
third
party
also.
and
i
think
it's
important,
your
honor
brings
up
the
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
about
why
it
would
be
reasonable
for
congress
to
have
differentiated
between
these
two
situations.
in
the
situation
where
the
person
is
entitled
compensation
and
pursues
an
action
against
the
third
party,
the
employer
has
a
subrogation
lien
that
this
court
has
recognized
under
bloomer
and
other
cases,
and
that
then
makes
sense
for
that
employer
to
have
notice
to
be
able
to
intervene
in
that
action,
to
be
able
to
have
some
input
because
they
have
a
vested
liability
and
a
vested
right
to
recoup.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mrs.
yates
may
never
have
gotten
benefits.
she
may
have
been
trying
to
enter
into
a
settlement
at
a
particular
time
before.
for
example,
an
employer
was
insolvent.
or
she
may
have
been
trying
to
enter
into
a
settlement
for
loss
of
consortium
at
a
wrong...
potential
wrongful
death
action
which
she
then
is
not
entitled
to
any
compensation
because
she
divorces
her
husband
or
she
predeceases
her
husband.
but
she
doesn't
have
that
option.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
she--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
part
of
the
problem
i
think,
your
honor,
with
what
congress
looked
at
when
they
eventually
decided
to
not
require
workers
to
elect
remedies
anymore.
she's
put
in
a
situation
of
either
taking
a
settlement
that
will
forever
preclude
her
from
future
potential
compensation
which
she
doesn't
know
if
she's
entitled
to
yet
or
being
left...
and
being
left
empty-handed.
but
she's
being
forced
into
a
choice
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
that
she
can't
make.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
a
person
who's
entitled
to
compensation
would
be
because
they
have
an
entitlement,
but
if
she
is
not
yet
entitled,
she
cannot
go
and
file
a
claim,
no.
she
only
becomes
entitled
to
compensation
after
her
husband
dies,
and
that's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
we
addressed
that
point
i
believe
and
it
was
raised
in
amicus
briefs
and
in
our
brief.
what
the
director
said
was
interpreting
which
employer
would
be
liable
for
the
compensation
benefits,
and
under
that
it's
the
employer
who
was
the
employer
at
the
time
of
the
death
or
the
injury.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that
doesn't
mean
that
the
person...
mrs.
yates'
entitlement
to
compensation
vested
at
that
time.
there
was
all
the
other
prerequisites
that
would
have
to
occur
before
she
could
become
entitled
to
it.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
you
don't
have
to
decide
that,
your
honor,
and
we
do
think
that
that's
an
open
question.
i
should
say
that
once
mrs.
yates
became
entitled
to
compensation
after
her
husband's
death,
she
did
obtain
prior
written
approval
from
the
employer
for--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
that's
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
petitioners
do
not
seek
an
offset
in
this
case,
and
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
we
think
in
light
of
the
court's
holding
in
cowart,
that
that
is
required.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
that
it
would
be
reasonable
for
congress
to
have
distinguished
between
someone
who
already
has
a
vested
right
to
compensation,
a
known
alternative
remedy,
vis-a-vis
a
person
who
only
has
a
potential,
perhaps
entitlement
at
a
later
point
in
time.
and
weighing
that
against
an
employer
in
the
first
situation
which
also
has
a
vested
liability
and
a
vested
lien
and
entitlement
to
recoup,
giving
that
employer
a
right
to
prevent
a
settlement
or
to
participate
in
that
settlement,
as
opposed
to
in
the
latter
situation
where
the
employer
has
no
liability
nor
lien
at
that
point
in
time.
and
we
also
think
again
because
of
the
very
different
nature
of
the
determinations
of
what
compensation
the
person
would
be
entitled
to
under
the
act,
in
the
one
instance,
when
the
person
is
entitled,
it's
a
reasonably,
generally
knowable
calculation
that
may
involve
actuarial
tables,
but
in
the
other
situation,
it
involves
much
more
than
actuarial
tables,
a
lot
of
eventualities
about
outliving
another
person
that...
expectancy
of
the
duration
of
a
marriage.
if
i
could,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
second
question
presented,
whether
or
not
the
director
is
entitled
to
participate
as
a
party
respondent
in
a
court
of
appeals.
we
believe
that
the
director
is
entitled
to
participate
under
rule
15(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
which
states
that
in
each
case
the
agency
must
be
named
respondent.
the
secretary--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--because
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
15
addresses
specifically
the
situation
where
courts
of
appeals
are
reviewing
agency
actions,
and
that
rule
envisioned
that
someone
from
that
agency
would
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
party
respondent.
it's
different
than
article
iii
standing,
your
honor.
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
not
standing,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
just
like
a
rule
about
intervention.
there
are
rules
for
parties
to
intervene
and
the
federal
rules
permit
that.
that's
to
bring
someone
who
isn't
a
party.
but
that's
not
giving
somebody
a
right
to
petition
or
article
iii
standing
to
seek
judicial
review.
that's
a
very
different
scenario.
i
would
also
point
out--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--under...
in
the
district
court,
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
24,
there
are
different
provisions...
situations--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
guess
it
depends
on
how
you
describe
standing,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
sense
of
article
iii
standing
that
you're
bringing
a
case
to
the
court
where
there's
a
case
of
controversy,
i
don't
think
that's
required
for
intervention.
a
intervenor
has
to
show
an
interest
in
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
it
depends.
there's
varying
levels
of
interest
and
it
may
be
that
one
person
is
entitled
to
intervene
as
of
a
right
because
there's
a
particular--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
but
we
think
here
the
idea
of
having
the
federal
agency
before
the
court
of
appeals
when
an
agency
action
is
being
reviewed
makes
eminent
sense.
and
in
the
court's
opinion
in
caputto,
it
talked
about
when
it
did
not
reach
expressly
this
issue...
it
talked
about
the
lower
court
opinion
in
that
case.
and
judge
friendly's
opinion
there
had
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
a
novel
form
of
review
of
an
agency
action
which
did
not
include
the
government
as
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
newport
news
addressed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
within
the
statutory
definition
of
a
person
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved.
the
director
in
that
particular
case
came
within
that.
i
think
that
all
the
parties
in
that
case
agreed,
in
fact,
and
the
court
reserved
the
question.
even
under
that
definition,
the
director
could
well
have
article
iii
standing
to
petition
for
review
under
some
situations.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
don't--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
board,
for
example,
would
not
be
an
appropriate
party
for
that
very
reason.
the
board
does
not
have
a
vested
right
to
defend
it.
the
situation
here
in
that
the
department
of
labor
is
very
unusual.
it
is
not
a
unitary
scheme
as
is
the
normal
scheme
under
most
agencies
where
rulemaking,
adjudication,
and
policymaking
are
all
in
the
same
entity.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
under
section
921(c),
your
honor,
the
longshore
act
itself
makes
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
under
that
provision,
once
the
benefits
review
board
opinion
is
petitioned
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
authority
and
power
to
modify,
reverse,
to
act
on
that
board's
opinion.
we
think
that's
why
it
supports
our
view
that
it's
not
the
board
but
the
director
that
is
named
the
agency
under
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
15.
prior
to
the
change
in
'72
where
the
structure
of
the
appellate
review
changed,
it
used
to
be
into
the
district
court,
and
then
the
director
could
of
course
participate.
in
'72
when
it
changed,
it
no
longer
identified
who
should
be
the
respondent.
it
identified
a
court.
several
courts
have
pointed
out
that
they
believe
in
light
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
enactment,
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
identify
the
respondent.
