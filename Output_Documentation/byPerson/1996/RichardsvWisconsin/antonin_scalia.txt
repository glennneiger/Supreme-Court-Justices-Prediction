the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
mention
homes
anyway,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
right
of
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects,
so
i
guess
the
real
issue
is
whether
a
hotel
room
is
a
house.
do
you
think
it's
a
house?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
if
they
don't
hear
guns
being
fired,
if
they
hear
nothing
but
what
the
court
expected
them
to
hear,
the
court
might
have
just
been
wrong,
isn't
that
right,
as
to
whether
it
would
violate
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
gee,
that
happens
a
lot
of
times
with
searches
and
seizures.
i
mean,
the
number
of
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
are
innumerable
now,
and
with
respect
to
every
one
of
those
exception,
exigent
circumstances
and
so
forth,
it's
up
to
the
police
officer
to
make
his
best
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
we're
not
saying
it's
not
reviewable,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
automobiles?
i
mean,
we
have
a
blanket
exception
for
automobiles,
don't
we?
you
can
search
automobiles
without
a
warrant.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
i'd
rather
be
inclined
to
rely
on
the
judgment
of
the
officers
as
to
what
is
more
or
less
likely
to
endanger
their
lives.
you're
asking
us
to
give
them
a
form
of
protection
that
they
are
too
stupid
to
give
to
themselves?
i
mean,
if,
indeed,
they're
getting
themselves
killed
more
often
by
crashing
in,
i
assume
they're
not
going
to
crash
in.
i
don't
know
why
we
have
to
adopt
a
constitutional
rule
to
protect
police
officers
from
themselves.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
mean,
this
argument
you've
been
dwelling
on
that,
you
know,
it's
going
to
hurt
the
police
officers
more,
i...
you
know,
it's
sort
of...
i
don't
see
it.
that'll
take
care
of
itself.
if,
indeed,
it's
more
dangerous
for
the
police
officers,
presumably,
in
the
nature
of
things,
police
officers
won't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
state
says
so.
i...
you
know,
and
i'm
inclined
to
accept
their
judgment
as
to
what's
more
dangerous
or
less
dangerous
for
the
police.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
weren't
blanket,
mr
karpe.
suppose
it
were
just
a...
this
really
wouldn't
serve
your
purposes
in
this
case
anyway.
suppose
we
just
had
a
rule,
sure,
ordinarily
you
must
knock
and
announce.
however,
there
are
extraordinary
circumstances
where
you
don't
have
to
and
ordinarily,
perhaps
almost
always,
drug-dealing
is
one
of
those
extraordinary
circumstances.
would
that
rule
satisfy
you?
it's
not
an
absolute
rule.
it
just
says,
you
know,
ordinarily.
conceivably
there's
some
situations
in
which
drug-dealing
wouldn't
allow
you
to
go
crashing
in
if
you
know
the
drugs
are
being
held
in
hundred-pound
bales
by
little
old
ladies
without
guns.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
these
are
violent
people
with
automatic
weapons,
rather
than
peaceful
people
with
automatic
weapons.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
quantity
of
the
automatic
weapons?
i
suppose
if
you
had,
you
know,
a
couple
of
hundred
of
them,
maybe
they
were
collecting
them,
right?
i
mean,
more
than
they
could
use.
if...
just
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
thought
it
was
enough
if
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
were
weapons
in
the
room,
that
that
would
be
enough
to
go
crashing
in,
weapons,
you
know,
at
the
ready.
if
i
think
that's
enough,
why
wouldn't
it
be
enough
simply
to
know
that
this
is
a
drug
dealer,
assuming
i
can
establish
that
95
percent
of
the
time
drug
dealers
are
armed?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
doyle--
--how
long
do
you
wait
after
announce
and
a
knock,
a
knock
and
announce?
i
mean,
you
knock,
announce,
nothing
happens.
how
long
does
the
officer
typically
wait
before
they
do
crash
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
enough
time
for
somebody
who
would
hear
the
knock
to
come?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
always
determine
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
on
our
own.
we
often
remand
where
there's
an
alternative
ground
argued.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
currently
so,
general
doyle,
but
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
about
moonshining
during
prohibition.
it
was
the
kind
of
a
crime
that
attracted
the
mob,
and
there
were
machine
guns
and
a
lot
of
violence.
i
expect
you
wouldn't
say
the
same
thing
about
it
today.
now,
if
we're
going
to
adopt
a
constitutional
rule,
does
this
constitutional
rule
change
as
the...
you
know,
as
the
proclivities
of
criminals
change?
why
not
just
leave
it
the
general
rule
that
where
you
have
cause
to
believe
that
you'll
be
endangered,
or
that
drugs...
or
what
you're
searching
for
will
be
destroyed,
you
can
enter
without
knocking,
and
as
things
now
are
that
would
work
out
that
in
99
percent
of
the
drug
cases
you'll
be
able
to
do
it.
but
if
the
culture
changes
and
drug
people
become
very
laid
back
and
pacific
instead
of
the
violent
people
they
are,
then
we
don't
have
to
adopt
a
new
constitutional
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
rebus
sic
stantibus,
right?
under
current
circumstances.
that
might
change
in
the
future.
is
that
the
government's
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
estrada,
what
do
you
do
about
general
doyle's
concern
that
it's
fine
to
have
this
general
rule,
but
it
will
always
be
controverted
at
the
exclusion
hearing,
where
the
defendant
will
come
in
and
say,
well,
you
knew
that
we
didn't
have...
you
knew
that
we
didn't
have
weapons.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
does
that
require
to
show,
that
we
didn't
have
weapons?
in
fact,
we
didn't
have
weapons.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
say,
you
knew
it.
is
that
enough
to
get
a
hearing?
