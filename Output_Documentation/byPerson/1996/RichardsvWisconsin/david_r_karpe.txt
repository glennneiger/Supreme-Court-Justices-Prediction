mr.
david
r.
karpe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
a
blanket
exception
to
the
knock-and-announce
rule
in
drug-dealing
cases.
this
case
turns
on
the
sanctity
of
the
home,
the
ultimate
private
place--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
fully
agree,
and
as
one
who
has
been
a
resident
of
a
hotel
recently
i
would
submit
that
it
is
the
longstanding
doctrine
of
this
court
that
a
hotel
room
is
a
home
for
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
under
stoner
v.
california--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--i
believe
stoner
v.
california,
u.s....
united
states
v.
jeffers,
united
states
v.--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--i...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
those
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
hotel
room
has
the
same
protection
as
a
home.
if
it
has
four
walls
and
a
roof,
it's
a
home.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
it
mentions--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
the
textual
use
of
house
is
not
referring
to
the...
protecting
the
structure
but
rather
what
occurs
inside
the
house.
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted
in
reaction
to
the
anti-federalist
concern
that
way
too
much
federal
power
was
going
to
exist
and
it
was
going
to
invade
the
home
and
what
it
contained,
the
privacy
of
the...
your
family,
your
spouse,
so
i
believe
that
the
home
is
the
core
value
of
the
fourth
amendment.
if
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
the
home,
it
doesn't
protect
anything.
now,
the
judge
who
issued
the
search
warrant
in
this
case
weighed
the
sanctity
of
the
home
against
the
general
allegation
by
the
police
that
drug
dealers
tend
to
carry
on,
and
the
judge
who
issued
the
warrant
found
that
no-knock
was
not
appropriate,
specifically
instructed
the
police
not
to
exercise
no-knock,
they
chose
to
disregard
that
when--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--i
have
seen
a
number
of
different
forms
of
applications
for
search
warrants,
justice
ginsburg,
and
sometimes
there's
check-off
boxes.
in
this
particular
case,
the
police
made
an
application
for
a
no-knock
and
judge
frankel,
upon
reviewing
the
facts
that
were
pled
in
the
complaint
for
the
search
warrant,
decided
that
the
circumstances
did
not
merit--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
ginsburg,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
there's
no
requirement
that
the
police
seek
advance
approval
of
no-knock.
no-knock
warrants
are
neither
specifically
forbidden
nor
specifically--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--often
they
do
that,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
i
cannot
speak
to
that,
justice--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
kennedy,
i
hope
i'm
understanding
your
question
correctly,
but
by--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--i
believe
that
was
judge
frankel's
intention,
that
his
review
of
the
facts
presented
to
him
did
not
present
that
it
would
be
reasonable--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
o'connor,
the
way
i
understand
the
question,
i
think
that
the
pre-approval
would
not
necessarily
make
the
search
reasonable.
it
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances
confronted
by
the
officer
at
the
time
of
the
entry.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
granted,
justice--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--yes,
justice
scalia,
which
is
why
it's
so
important
that
there
not
be
a
blanket
exception
that
basically
removes
the
judicial
process
and
has
law
enforcement
then
acting
in
a
way
unfettered
by
legal
process.
it
basically
makes
the
line
officer
the
final
judge,
jury,
and
executioner.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
yes,
justice
scalia,
but
hopefully
reviewable
by
a
court.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
the
blanket
exception
makes
it,
justice
scalia,
a
very
simplistic
process.
the
questions
that
are
asked
are,
was
there
a
search
warrant?
was
there
evidence
of
drug
dealing?
and
it's
not--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--yes,
justice
scalia,
and
i
don't...
the
founders
didn't
include
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
we
had
a
right
to
be
secure
in
our
carriages
or
whatever.
the
house
is
textual.
the...
this
is...
in
this
area
of--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--in
this
area,
we
would
submit
that
a
blanket
rule
would
never
be
acceptable
with
regard
to
unannounced
entries.
the
courts
even
found--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
kennedy,
i
agree
that
that
did
set
a
blanket
rule,
but--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--apart...
but
that
was
a
very
de
minimis
sort
of
intrusion.
the
car
is
stopped
anyway.
this
is
not
a
de
minimis
intrusion.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
the
court
had
already
ruled
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms
that
asking
the
driver
to
step
out
under
the
same
circumstances
was
de
minimis.
i
think
that
maryland
v.
wilson
was
a
fairly
simple
extension.
this
is
simply
not
de
minimis
by
any
means.
this
is
one
of
those
extraordinary
searches,
extraordinary
invasion
which
is
unusually
dangerous
and
unusually
invasive
of
someone's
privacy
and
their
safety.
people
get
killed
during
these
things.
there's
a
high
risk
in
a
no-knock
search
the
citizens
are
going
to
experience
some
sort
of
injury.
the
police
come
banging
in
through
the
door,
weapons
are
drawn,
there's
no
notice,
and
it's
dangerous
to
police,
too.
people
might
think
they're
being
burglarized.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
o'connor,
there
was
no
indication
that
steiney
richards
had
weapons.
this
was
a
19-year-old
kid
from
detroit
who's
dealing
coke.
he's
not
a
member
of
the
medellin
cartel.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
yes.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
yes,
but--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--well,
i
think--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
breyer,
i
think
it's
ambiguous
that
he
knew
that
that
was
police.
he
looks
out,
he
sees
someone--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--he
knew
someone
was
trying
to
bang
the
door
down.
he
figured,
give
up
the
drugs
and
save
his
skin.
i
mean,
hop
out
the
window.
we're
talking
about
december
31
in
wisconsin.
he
was
not
going
to
get
very
far
without
a
shirt,
justice
breyer.
[laughter]
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
breyer,
there
is
certainly
no
indication
that
mr.
richards
was
going
to
attempt
to
destroy
drugs,
and
certainly
the
way
they
were
packaged
he
would
have
had
a
heck
of
a
time.
they
were
basically
divided
up
into
120
little
plastic
packets,
plus
and
to
answer
your
question
and
at
the
same
time
sort
of
get
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
mere
fact
that
even
if
a
drug
dealer
has
guns,
it
does
not
mean
he
intends
to
use
them
against
the
police.
more
than...
more
often
than
not
it's
to
get...
to
enforce
debts,
to
protect
themselves
against
rivals,
and
people
certainly
are
afraid
of
being
burglarized.
the
most
dangerous
instances
that
we've
come
across
in
terms
of
these
sort
of
police
invasions
without
announcement
is
that
people
think
they're
being
burglarized
and
take
weapons
out,
get
ready
to
shoot,
and
when
they
learn
it's
the
police,
then
they
drop
the
weapons.
the
instances
where
police
tend
to
get
shot
is
not
this
myth
that
the
allegro
article
that's
often
referred
to
speaks
of,
this
fatal
funnel
where
the
drug
dealer
stands
at
the
door
with
his
weapon
pointed
at
the
door
waiting
for
someone
to
come
in.
more
often
than
not,
when
an
officer
is
killed
during
one
of
these
searches
it's
because
there's
someone
in
a
back
room
who's
hiding,
and--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
scalia,
i
agree,
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
there
to
protect
government.
it's
not
there
to
protect
law
enforcement.
it's
there
to
protect
citizens.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
that
in
fact
it
is
more
dangerous
to
the
police
to
announce.
that
just
is
not
there.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
i...
in
any
case...
i
don't...
this
is
not
really
in
response
to
your
question,
but
in
any
case,
in
the...
this
court's
very
well-reasoned
and
unanimous
decision
in
wilson
v.
arkansas,
this
court
recognized
the
presumption
in
favor
of
announcement.
i
think
that
the
blanket
exception
in
fact
ignores
the
precepts
of
wilson
and
sets
a
presumption
against
announcement.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
scalia,
again,
that...
the
presumption
there
is
going
the
wrong
way.
sir,
i'm
not
saying
there
has
to
be
announcement
in
every
single
case,
but
to
basically
except
what
i...
i
assume
you're
discussing
the
u.s.'s
position--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--would
create
a
situation
where
the
police
would
possibly
have
no
motivation
to
uncover
facts
but
might
lead
to
an
indication
that
this
is
the
exception
to
the
exception.
i
think
it's
a
very
hard
to
enforce
rule
for
law
enforcement,
and
is
the
defendant
then
to
have
the
burden
of
persuasion?
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
if
there's
a
specific
indication
that
there
is
danger
to
the
officer,
that
would
be
acceptable.
to
say
it
can
be
easily
destroyed
i
think
goes
too
far
and
leads
to
procrustean
application,
because
we
can't
deny
that
many
drugs,
particularly
in
small
quantities,
can
easily
be
destroyed.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
souter,
i
think
that
it
leads
to
a
danger
in
application--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--i
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
there's
drugs
present
and
that
there's
a
toilet
bowl
nearby
would
not
constitute
exigent
circumstances.
it's
certainly
easy
enough
for
the
police
to
turn
off
the
water
so
the
drugs
can
be
flushed--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--well,
i'm
not
arguing
for
the
one-flush
rule,
but--
[laughter]
the...
many
toilets
in
apartments
and
hotels
do
not
have
tanks.
they
can
be
easily
flushed
off
from
outside
the
room.
and
i
suppose
the
police
could
even
put
a
tap
on
the
sewer
line
so
that
the
evidence
is
recovered.
it
fact,
it
has
greater
weight,
so
the
penalty
would
be
greater,
because
then
instead
of
just
having
the
drug,
you've
got
the
drug
in
solution.
but
in
any
case,
this
would
be
a
procrustean
sort
of
application,
which
mr.
richards
certainly
wouldn't
fit.
he
was
not
poised
to
destroy
evidence.
he...
there
was
no
indication
that
he
was
going
to
be
armed
or
violently
resist,
and
it
will
fit
a
lot
of
people
even
less
than
it
fit
mr.
richards.
certainly
someone
who
has
a
marijuana-growing
operation
outside
the
house
would
not
fit
this
sort
of--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
when
there
are
particular
circumstances
indicating
there
are
exigent
circumstances
present,
or--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--mr.
chief
justice,
there's
usually
an
informant
involved
in
these
things
who's
been
in
the
home,
who
can
see
whether
there's
provisions
being
made
for
destruction
of
property,
see
whether
the
people
are
armed.
certainly
in
wilson
v.
arkansas
the
court
was
aware
of
a
number
of
factors
that
could
have
led
the
court
to
conclude
that
a
blanket
rule
was
acceptable
and
the
court
wisely
chose
not
to
do
so.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
stevens,
that
again
would
approach
a
blanket
sort
of
rule.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
well,
i...
justice
stevens,
i
don't
know
if
i
understood
the
question
correctly,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
necessarily
draw
the
conclusion
each
time
there's
drugs
that
there's
both
weapons
and--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
stevens,
i
think
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
particular--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--there
has
to
be--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
when
there
would
be
a
particular
circumstance
that--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--that
threats
had
been
made
to
other
persons,
that
they
had
indicated
some
sort
of
intention
to
violently
resist,
that--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--justice
scalia,
some
people
collect
automatic
weapons.
[laughter]
mr.
david
r.
karpe
well,
i
think
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
is
the
applicable
standard
here.
it's
one
of
the
relatively
simpler
concepts
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
it's
easy
for
the
police
to
apply
and
should
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
no.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
occupants
in
fact
have
the
weapons,
were
prone
to
use
them,
weren't
just
collecting
them--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--perhaps...
perhaps,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
depend
on
the
quantity
of
the
drugs
involved
as
well,
but
there
would
have
to
be
a
regard
towards
the
particularity
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
lies
in
the
fact
that
drug
dealers
do
not
necessarily
have
arms
to
use
against
the
police
but
rather
to
defend
against
people
who
might
steal
from
them,
to
enforce
debts,
and
particularly
many
people
have
firearms
just
around,
not
for
particularly
drug-related
purposes,
even
though
they
might
be
drug
suspects.
this...
the
knock-and-announce
rule
protects
the
innocent
and
the
relatively
innocent
as
well,
and
if
i
may
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
thank
you.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
in
wilson
v.
arkansas,
this
court
gave
the
state
courts
an
inch,
the
wisconsin
state
court
took
a
mile,
drained
the
blood
out
of
the
meaning
of
wisconsin...
excuse
me,
of
wilson
v.
arkansas.
the
instances
where
blanket
rules
have
been
applied
by
this
court
don't
apply.
michigan
v.
summers
regarded
simply
a
detention
while
the
search
was
going
on.
it
wasn't
even
about
the
search.
in
united
states
v.
dunn,
480
united
states
294
at
page
301,
footnote
4,
this
court
rejected
a
blanket
rule
even
for
curtilage
of
a
house,
and
i
made
a
mistake,
we
did
not
include
this
in
the
brief.
in
fact,
it
wasn't
until
i
read
the
as-to-yet
undistributed
wayne
county
amicus
brief
that
i
was
made
aware
of
the
dunn
case.
in
maryland
v.
buie,
this
court
rejected
a
blanket
rule
involving
a
search
of
the
house.
if
i
could
speak
to
the
manner
of
drug
storage
in
this
particular
case,
yes,
the
drugs
were
in
the
bathroom,
but
behind
a
ceiling
tile,
wrapped
up
several
times
in
different
bags,
and
again,
among
the
packaging
there
were
120
separate
little
ziplock
gem
packs.
this
rule
is
not
to
be
given
a
grudging
application
by
this
court.
then
the
blanket
exception
essentially
swallows
the
rule.
it
applies
to
all
sorts
of
offenses.
in
footnote
2
of
a
lower
court
opinion
it
refers
even
to
maintaining
a
dwelling
for
use
of
drugs.
i
mean,
it
refers
to
obtaining
drugs
by
contraband.
one
of
the
very
important
purposes
of
this
rule
is
to
avoid
unreasonable
error.
certainly
we
have
to
tolerate
some
police
errors,
but
it
must
be
errors
of
the
police
acting
as
reasonable
people.
mr.
david
r.
karpe
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
apply
to
two
college
kids
in
a
dorm
room
that
doesn't
even
have
a
toilet
that
pass
a
joint
back
and
forth.
they're
committing
a
felony
in
wisconsin,
distribution,
and
there's
no--
mr.
david
r.
karpe
--how
about
the
single
mother
with
six
kids
who's
selling
joints
out
the
back
door?
would
that
apply
to
her?
do
we
really
want
the
police
crashing
in
in
that
sort
of
situation?

well,
i
guess
it's
hard...
it's
hard
perhaps
to
draw
the
line.
the
more
drugs
someone
has,
the
harder
it
is
going
to
be
to
destroy
them.
i
think
that
the...
that
rule
would
have
problems,
big
problems
in
application
just
to
decide
at
what
point
and
what
quantity
of
drug
are
we
going
to
decide
that
the
rule
would
apply.
