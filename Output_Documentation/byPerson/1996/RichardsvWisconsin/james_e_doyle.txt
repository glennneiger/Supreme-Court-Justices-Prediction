mr.
james
e.
doyle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
made
a
common
sense
determination,
in
light
of
the
modern-day
drug
trade,
that
in
the
execution
of
search
warrants
for...
in
felony
drug-dealing
cases
it
is
reasonable
under
fourth
amendment
standards
for
the
officers
to
knock,
announce
their
presence,
and
give
the
occupants
an
opportunity
to
react.
there
is
discussion
about
what
an
invasive,
intrusive
entry
into
the
home
this
search
is,
and
we
agree.
agents
inform
me
that
if
you
had
videotapes
of
a
no-knock
search
and
a
knock
search
in
a
drug
case,
you
would
be...
you
would
see
almost
exactly
the
same
events
occur
on
that
videotape,
that
even
in
the
knock
case,
there
will
be
an
overpowering
number
of
officers
that
are
going
to
enter
those
premises.
the
officers
will
have
their
guns
drawn.
the
officers
will
be
shouting,
police,
police,
search
warrant.
the
officers
will
round
up
all
of
the
occupants
on
those
premises.
those
occupants
may
sometimes
be
children.
those
occupants
may
sometimes
be
elderly.
those
occupants...
because
in
wisconsin
we
have
no
rule
against
night-time
searches,
most
of
these
searches
in
fact
occur
at
night.
those
occupants
may
frequently
be
sleeping.
whether
there
is
a
knock-and-announce
or
a
no-knock,
there
will
be
a
rapid,
overpowering
securing
of
the
premises
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
who
enter.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
we...
in
wisconsin...
it
depends
somewhat
on
the
circumstances,
the
size
of
the
room.
a
motel
room
is
going
to
be
less
than
a
mansion,
but
roughly
10
to
15
seconds,
enough
time
for
somebody
to
come
to
the
door
and
open
the
door.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
harms
law
enforcement
enormously,
because
in
circumstances,
and
we
would
argue
in
drug-dealing
cases,
because
that
knock
and
announce,
it's
10
to
15
seconds
of
waiting,
and
then
it's
however
long
a
time
it
takes
to
get
organized
then
to
come
through
the
door.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
and
during
that
time
a
person
on
the
other
side
who
is
going
to
train
a
gun
at
that
door
has
full
time
to
do
it,
or
a
person
who
is
intent
on
destroying
narcotics
may
do
it.
there's
a
suggestion
in
this
case
that
there's
no
evidence
that
anybody
was
going
to
destroy
drugs.
well,
it's
interesting,
these
drugs
were
stored
in
the
bathroom.
that...
and
under
wisconsin
law,
like
under
most
law,
even
if
you
don't
get
them
all
destroyed,
the
fewer
drugs
they
find
the
lesser
penalties
you
have
under
our
drug
laws.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
is
true--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--it
is
true
that
in
every
drug
case
there
will
be
destruction,
there
is
the
potential
of
destruction.
the
wisconsin
blanket
rule
applies
only
to
felony
drug
cases
because
of
the
convergence
in
a
violent
and
dangerous
form
of
commerce
of
weapons
and
the
destruction
of
drugs.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
in
most
misdemeanor
cases,
even
on
a
case-by-case
analysis
with
the
police
officers
going
to
the
door
in
a
drug
case,
that
in
that
case-by-case
analysis...
there
may
be
some
exceptions
to
it,
but
in
that
case-by-case
analysis
the
balance
would
weigh
heavily
on
the
side
of
the
police.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
in
a
low-level...
in
a
case-by-case
analysis,
in
a
low-level
drug
case
in
which
there's
information
that
it
is
only
the
grandmother
who
is
on
the
premises,
perhaps.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
she
may
be,
but
as
i
say,
in
a
case-by-case
analysis
with...
in
a
misdemeanor
simple
possession
of
marijuana
with
a
grandmother
on
the
premises,
perhaps
it
is
sufficient.
perhaps
in
that
balance
you
would
come
out
with
a
knock-and-announce,
but
what
we
are
advocating--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
believe
you
do
not
have
to
knock
and
announce
where
you
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
destruction
of
evidence
will
occur.
the
question
before
the
court
here,
i
believe,
is
whether
you
can
apply
that
in
a
blanket
way,
as
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
done
in
felony
drug-dealing
cases,
or
whether
in
each
individual
case
we
have
to
have
a
suppression
hearing
in
which
those
specific
facts
are
laid
out.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
on
the
question
of
whether
it
will
be
a
formality,
much
depends
on
what
position
this
court
adopts
in
this
case.
if
you
were
to--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--adopt
the
petitioner's
position
it
is
much
more
than
a
formality.
we'd
have
detailed
hearings--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--yes,
i
believe
you
are,
justice
souter.
let
me
say
that
the
position
you've
laid
out,
as
i
understand
it,
is
essentially
that
of
the
solicitor
general,
and
it's
one
that
we
would
prevail
on
in
this
case
under
the
record
and
that
we
would
accept,
but
i
do
think
that
there
are
values
and
reasons
to
go
beyond
it
for
the
blanket
rule,
and
there
are
two
of
them.
the
first
is
that
the
officer
at
the
scene,
as
he
or
she
approaches
the
door,
or
as
they
approach
the
door
in
drug
cases
is...
will
be,
under
the
blanket
rule,
able
to
make
a
strategic,
tactical
decision
not
worrying
about
whether
or
not
it
will
meet
a
reasonableness
fourth
amendment
test
at
a
later
time
down
the
road.
and
in
that
regard
i
think
it
is...
this
case
is
very
much
in
line
with
michigan
v.
summers,
in
which
in
the
manner
of
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant
this
court
did
adopt
a
bright
line
rule
that
permitted
officers
to
round
up
the
people
on
the
premises
where
a
search
warrant
was
being
executed.
and
here
we
are
talking,
just
as
in
michigan
v.
summers,
with
the
manner
of
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant,
and
i
believe
that
police
officers,
for
their
safety,
for
the
safety
of
the
occupants
within,
should
be
able
to
make
those
decisions
on
the
entry
based
on
their
tactical
and
strategic
decisions.
now,
they
may
decide
for
reasons
that
were
mentioned
earlier
by
my
opponent
that
in
some
of
those
instances
it
may
not
be
safe
and
wise
to
come
barging
in.
it
may
be
safer
for
everyone
to
come
in
a
different
way,
but
that
decision
is
a
strategic
and
tactical
one.
the
second
issue
is,
i
think
that
over
time
you
will
see
those
relatively
benign
suppression
hearings
become
very
complicated
hearings
about
what
additional
facts
did
the
police
know.
okay,
you--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
we
have
to
prove
these
were
the
only
facts
we
had,
and
we
had
no
further
facts...
we
knew
he
was
a
drug
dealer,
felony
drug
dealer,
and
that's
what
we
knew,
and
then
we
go
through
a
hearing
on
what
more
did
you
know,
if
we
have
to
prove
what
we
didn't
know,
it
becomes
almost
an
impossibility.
i
think
you
will
also
be
led,
justice
souter,
into
a
series
of
hearings
and
a
whole
area
of
new
issues
of
law
for
you
to
be
resolved
about
what
further
proof
is
enough
to
overcome
the
drug-dealing
exception.
all
right--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
wilson
v.
arkansas
is...
was
not
a
useless
exercise.
i
think
this
court
clearly
said
that
the
knock-and-announce
is
part
of
the
reasonableness
consideration
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct,
and
you
made
it
clear
in
wilson
v.
arkansas
that
the
facts,
and
whether
there...
whether
it
was
justified
to
enter
without
a
no-knock,
would
be
remanded
to
the
arkansas
courts
to
be
determined,
and
this
court
also
made
it
clear
in
wilson
v.
arkansas
that
it
was...
you
were
going
to
leave
it
to
the
state
courts
at
least
for
a
while
to
begin
to
determine
those
times
in
which
legitimate
law
enforcement
concerns
outweighed
the
requirement
of
knock-and-announce.
as
i
read
wilson
v.
arkansas,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
just
sort
of
put
it
to
you
pretty
bluntly.
i
mean,
they
said
this
doesn't
have
any
fourth
amendment
implications,
and
i
think
this
court
said
it
does
have
fourth
amendment
implications,
and
we
are
here
agreeing,
and
in
fact
the
wisconsin
courts
have
always
agreed
it
has
fourth
amendment
implications.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
that,
if
i
might
say
so,
you
were
correct
at
remanding
to
have
the
arkansas
court
system
consider
the
facts
of
that
case
under
the...
in
light
of
the
determination
that
knock-and-announce
is
part
of
the
reasonableness
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
you
sent
it
back
to
a
state
court
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
that's
correct,
and
again,
after
wilson
v.
arkansas,
as
this
court
made
it
very
clear,
it
said
that
failure
to
knock
and
announce
might
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
you
were
going
to
leave
it
to
states.
we--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
think
it
is
difficult,
justice
breyer,
to
come
up
with
another
category
of
cases--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--there
is
no
doubt,
i
think,
in
a
bank
robbery
where
people
are
injured
on
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
there
would
be
no
problem
with
knock
and
announce,
assuming
it
was
close
in
time.
to
say,
however,
that
all
murders
or
all
bank
robberies
are
exempt
may
be
another
case
that
will
come
along,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
drug-dealing
case
goes
well
beyond
them,
because--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--drug-dealing
has...
is
a
commerce
in
this
country.
it
is
an
illegal
commerce.
it
is
a
commerce,
unfortunately,
that
is
marked
by
danger
and
violence.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct,
your
honor,
many
crimes
are
serious,
but
that
drug-dealing
fits
into
a
particular...
there
is
not
a
commerce
in
murders
or
in
bank
robberies.
there
is
a
commerce
in
drug-dealing,
and
it
is
a
commerce
that
is
characterized
by
the
use
of
weapons,
by
the
willingness
to
use
weapons,
by
gang-domination,
by--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--what
i
am
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to,
as
you
did
in
maryland
v.
wilson,
is
to
determine
reasonableness
in
a
category
of
cases,
and
that
reasonable
test--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--your
honor,
the
best
that
we
can
do
is
what
is
in
our
brief,
which
shows
that
drug-dealing
is
dangerous
and
it's
dangerous
to
police,
but
frankly--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--as
a
statistical
matter
i
don't
think
you
can
make
that
decision
because
i
agree,
there's
never
been
a
scientific
peer-reviewed
study
on
if
you
knock
and
announce
or
you
don't
knock
and
announce,
what
happens.
but
as
i
think
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier,
that's
a
judgment
that's
made
by
police
officers
every
day
as
they
approach--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
believe
that
you
should
rely
that
it
is
frequently...
it
is
dangerous
for
police
to
knock
and
announce
their
presence,
and--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--well,
we're
asking
you
to
say
that
it's
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment.
whether
states
want
to
go
to
the
full
extent
of
what
you
declare
to
be
the
limit
that
they
can
go
to
under
the
fourth
amendment
will
be
for
different
states
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but
also,
on
those
kinds
of
hypotheticals
there
are
certainly
facts
presented
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
to
the
court's
common
knowledge,
that
the
fact
that
it's
an
elderly
person,
or
the
fact,
for
example,
of
those
justice
department
numbers--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--that's
correct,
and
unfortunately
in
this
day
and
age,
because
they're
elderly
may
not
mean
they're
not
going
to
be
violent.
