chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-5955,
steiney
richards
v.
wisconsin.
mr.
karpe,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
fellow
was
actually
in
a
motel
room,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
case
that
says
a
motel
room
is
a
home?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
agree
with
you
those
cases
said
that
a
hotel
room
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i
don't
know
that
any
of
them
ever
said
a
hotel
room
is
a
home.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that's
probably
correct,
but
to
say...
when
you
say
that
a
motel
room...
we're
talking
here
about
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
you're
talking
about
something
that
is
protected
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
same
way
that
a
home
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
what
circumstances,
mr.
karpe,
do
you
think
the
police
may
dispense
with
the
knock-and-announce
rule
in
connection
with
a,
say,
a
drug
search?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
some
of
those
indications
be?
i
mean,
how
easy
would
your
rule
be
to
apply
in
practice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
reasonable
suspicion
of
automatic
weapons?
then
that
would
not
be
enough
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
reasonable
suspicion
of
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
serious
about
saying,
this
is
a
drug
bust
and
you
would
have
to
show
that
the
automatic
weapons
that
the
putative
defendants
had
weren't
just
being
collected
in
the
motel
room?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
karpe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
doyle,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
part
of
it
be
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
in
those
hearings?
i
mean,
if
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proof
at
the
suppression
that
it
didn't
know
anything
more,
it's
very
hard
to
prove
a
negative.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
thank
you,
general
doyle.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
also
identify...
you
have
a
warrant
issued
by
a
magistrate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
whom
is
the
burden
of
proof?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
karpe,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
karpe.
the
case
is
submitted.
