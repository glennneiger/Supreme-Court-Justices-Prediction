would
it
be
a
fair
interpretation
to
say
that
the
judge
instructed
the
officers
that
they
must
knock,
and
failure
to
do
so
was
therefore
a
violation
of
the
warrant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
striking
it
out,
does
that
mean
that
they
must
knock?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
that's
not
really
in
this
case.
this
case
is
here
for
us
to
test
the
rule
announced
by
the
wisconsin
court
that
did
not
depend
on
the
interpretation
of
the
warrant.
what
would
your
position
be
if
in
situations
where
the
magistrate
does
authorize
a
no-knock
entry,
do
you
say
that
if
police
then
follow
such
an
authorization
and
enter
without
knocking,
can
we
have
a
blanket
rule
saying
that
if
the
magistrate
has
authorized
it
it
is
going
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
recently
announced
a
blanket
rule,
did
we
not,
in,
i
believe
it's
maryland
v.
wilson,
with
reference
to
people
stepping
out
of
automobiles.
isn't
this
just
as
sensible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
are
blanket
rules.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
state
supreme
court
made
the
judgment
here,
or
so
you're
saying
that
we
should
not
rely
on
the
danger
of
knocking
versus
danger
of
not
knocking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
unless
we
could
say
that
each
state
supreme
court
is
capable
of
making
that
judgment.
then
one
state
says
it's
more
dangerous,
the
other
state
says
it
isn't,
and
then
we
have
to
accept
that,
but
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
don't
think
that
we
would
adopt
that
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
suggesting
a
general
standard,
not
a
per
se
rule.
is
that
an
appropriate
characterization
of
your
brief
and
of
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
curious
to
know,
if
the
magistrate
makes
the
determination
that
you
must
knock,
directs
the
officer
to
knock
as
part
of
the
warrant,
and
the
officers
see
something
that
they
think
overrides
the
judgment,
and
they
don't
knock,
that
does
not
necessarily
invalidate
the
search,
does
it?
