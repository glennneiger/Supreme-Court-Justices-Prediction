justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
jumped
out
the
window,
didn't
he?
i
mean,
he
had
time.
as
soon
as
he
finds
out
the
police
are
here
he
jumps
out
the
window,
runs
away.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
a
legitimate
concern?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
he
just
jump
out
the
window
for
fun?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
that...
right.
[laughter]
the
police
say...
i
think
they
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
some...
with
drug
deals
in
general,
not
announcing
their
presence,
because
a)
they
might
get
killed,
or
b)
the
person
might
jump
out
the
window,
or
c)
he
might
flush
the
drugs
down
the
toilet.
they
say
that
happens
all
the
time...
all
the
time.
as
soon
as
they
find
out,
police,
it's
into
the
bathroom,
the
drugs
are
gone,
and
they
want
to
preserve
the
evidence,
they
don't
want
him
to
run
away,
and
they
don't
want
to
get
shot,
so
what
is
the
response
to
those
three?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
if
we
do
that...
i
mean,
what
i'd
be
rather
worried
about
here
is,
if
a
blanket
rule
crime-by-crime
is
constitutional,
wilson
v.
arkansas
doesn't
mean
too
much,
i
would
think,
because
after
all,
most
people
who
are
arrested
and
searched
have
committed,
at
least
probable
cause
to
believe
they've
committed
rather
serious
crimes.
so
if
a
state
could
go
through
its
criminal
code
and
sort
of
block
off
every
serious
crime,
there
aren't
too
many
instances,
are
there,
in
which
it
would
have
to
follow
the
wilson
v.
arkansas
rule,
while
at
least
if
you
make
it
case-by-case
you
weed
out
at
some
hearing
price
the
instances
where
there
really
wasn't
a
good
reason
to
dispense
with
the
requirement.
that's
what
i
would
be
concerned
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
murder,
for
example,
or
armed
bank
robbery
where
people
are
injured,
and
let's
try,
you
know,
serious
assaults,
and
we
could
go
through
and
find
lots
of
rather
serious
crimes
in
a
criminal
code.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
all
felony...
felonious
use
of
marijuana
is
serious,
and
murder
is
subject
to
case-by-case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
serious.
my
point
is,
many,
many
crimes
are
serious.
