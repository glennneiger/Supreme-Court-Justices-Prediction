well,
that
could
be
major.
it
could
be
a
storm,
and
it
could
be
some
poor
woman
nursing
a
tiny
baby,
or
some
sick
person.
that's
not
a
de
minimis
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
dangerous
even
with
a
knock
and
announce
as
well,
i
assume,
in
situations
like
this
where
there's
a
drug
dealer
with
weapons.
by
knocking
and
saying,
police
here,
it
gives
the
person
time
to
get
the
weapons
ready
and
you
can
have
just
as
much
danger
to
the
police
who
enter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
were
speaking
in
generalities--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
so
was
i.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you...
may
i
ask
you
in
doing
that
if
you
have
any
statistical
evidence
that
you
want
to
point
out
to
us
that
demonstrates
that
it
is
more
dangerous
to
officers
to
knock
and
announce
than
not
to?
is
there
any
place
we
could
look
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general,
i
mean,
as
far
as
we
know
they're
as
apt
to
be
hurt
if
they
don't
knock
and
announce
as
if
they
do.
we
aren't
able
to
make
that
decision,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
not
supporting
the
wisconsin
rule
in
any
event,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
per
se
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
you
support
the
rule
if
we
were
only
dealing
with
situations
where
the
magistrate
had
specifically
determined
they
should
enter
without
knocking?
what
about
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
statutes
in
nebraska
and
utah
to
that
effect
presumably
are
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
what
about
those
states
that
do,
by
statute,
provide
that
the
magistrate
will
consider
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
can
be
a
no-knock
entry?
now,
if
that's
the
scheme,
then
is
it
constitutional
to
have
a
per
se
rule?
