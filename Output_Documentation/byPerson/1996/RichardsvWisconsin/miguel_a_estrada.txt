mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
law
officers
who
have
a
warrant
to
search
for
evidence
of
narcotics
dealing
ordinarily
will
be
justified
in
concluding
that
announcement
to
the
dwelling,
or
to
those
in
the
dwelling
will
endanger
the
safety
of
the
officers
and
create
a
significant
risk
that
evidence
will
be
destroyed.
therefore--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that
is
right.
a
fundamental
point
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
is
that
all
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
what
can
be
a
basis
for
a
reasonable
belief
on
the
part
of
the
officers
that
they
will
be
in
danger,
or
that
the
drugs
will
be
destroyed,
and
our
fundamental
point
is
that
a
judgment
based
on
past
experience
with
similar
cases
is
just
as
valid
a
ground
for
a
reasonable
belief
on
the
part
of
the
officer
as
may
be
the
circumstances
that
confront
the
officer
at
the
specific
time
of
the
entry.
and
in
our
view
those
circumstances,
if
nothing
more
is
known,
will
ordinarily
warrant
the
officer
in
thinking
that
those
dangers
exist
and
to
make
an
unannounced
entry.
on
the
other--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
reason
to
think
that
in
those
particular
cases
the
manner
of
entry
makes
any
difference.
fundamentally
as
well,
we're
dealing
in
this
case
with
a
class
of
cases
in
which
the
fundamental
intrusion
is
by
right.
that
is
to
say,
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
has
already
determined
that
the
officers
will
come
in.
in
that
other
category
of
cases
it
is
more
likely
to
be
the
case
that
someone
has
made
a
call
on
the
telephone
indicating
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
officer
simply
to
come
and
investigate,
and
it's
not
necessarily
true
in
those
cases
that
you
know
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
call
as
the
basis
for
any
further
official
action.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
it
is
not...
and
just
to
put
our
point
in
context,
our
point
in
this
case
is
that
that
may
have
significance
in
the
officer's
reasonable
conduct.
it
is
a
fact
that
the
officer
may
take
into
account.
there
may
be
other
facts.
i
don't
know
that
much
about--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
may
be
the
case
that
there
are
other
cases
in
which
similar...
in
which
a
similar
rule
is
warranted,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
think
that
the
class
of
cases
that
we
have
here
are
significant
in
that
we
have
the
courts
all
over
the
country
telling
this
court
that
this
is
a
class
of
cases
in
which
there
is
a
remarkable
danger
of
violence,
and
a
high
danger
that
the
evidence
will
be
destroyed,
and
this
court--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that's
right,
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
in
that
other
class
of
cases
it
is
likely
to
be
the
case
that
the
fundamental
intrusion
into
the
home
has
not
been
authorized.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
justice
kennedy.
all
we're
saying
is
that
the
standard
that
is
offered
by
mr.
karpe
is
so
low
that
in
the
absence
of
any
further
information
the
officer's
knowledge
that
the
case
involves
drug-dealing
will
itself
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
a
case-specific
reasonable
belief
that
there
is
danger
to
the
officers.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
we're
not.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
not
a
course
that
as
i
read
this
court's
cases
is
open
to
the
court,
because
it
was
an
argument
that
was
made
in
the
dalia
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
they
are
not
constitutionally
required.
in
making
the
judgment
that
a
no-knock
entry
may
be
okay,
it
is
possible
for
a
state
or
for
the
federal
rules
to
have
that
sort
of
a
mechanism.
my
point
is
that
it
is
not
constitutionally
required,
because
in
the
dalia
case
this
court
confronted
that
issue,
whether
the
judge
should
authorize
in
advance
an
unannounced
entry,
and
the
court
answered
that
issue
in
the
negative,
so
it
may
be
a
good--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is...
it
likely
is,
if
the
judge
has
made
a
finding
that
that
is
a
course
that
is
warranted
in
the
circumstances.
my
point
was
solely
to
say
that
that's
not
a
course
that
can
be
required
under
the
fourth
amendment,
because
that
is
an
issue
that
the
court
has
already
considered
in
the
dalia
case,
and
the
answer
was
in
the
negative.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
and
let
me
take
that
as
an
opportunity
to
answer
something
that
mr.
karpe
said.
when
the
warrant
was
sought
in
this
case
it
was
in
1991,
and
at
that
time
the
state
courts
in
this
state
had
a
rule
that
a
mere
showing
that
the
case
involves
drug-dealing
and
an
assertion
that
those
cases
are
likely
to
be
categorically
dangerous
was
insufficient
to
authorize
a
judge
to
issue
a
no-knock
warrant,
so
all
that
the
judge
in
this
case
did
was
to
say
that
the
facts
that
are
in
this
case
had
no
bearing
on
whether
a...
whether
the
officers
should
make
a
no-knock
entry.
it
is
not
that
the
judge
made
a
determination
under
the
right
fourth
amendment
standard
that
the
circumstances
in
this
case
did
not
justify
a
no-knock
entry.
further--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
think
that
in
our
view
someone
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
unless
he
can
point
to
objectively
ascertainable
facts
that
indicate
that
prima
facie
at
least
the
conduct
was
clearly
unreasonable.
in
the
federal
system
there
are
very
few
suppression
hearings
held,
because
unless
someone
is
able
to
come
forth
with
a
prima
facie
showing
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
one
is
not
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
so
that
one
may
inquire.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
you
would
have
to
have
a
specific
factual
basis
for
the
imputation
that
they
knew
it,
and
in
the
absence
of
that,
no
hearing
would
be
required.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
in
a
search
that
is
conducted
under
a
search
warrant,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
defendant.
if
a
search
is
conducted
in
the
absence
of
such
a
warrant,
it
would
be
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
conduct
was
lawful.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
under
the
wilson
case,
given
that
the
background
rule
is
that
they
should
not,
yes.
