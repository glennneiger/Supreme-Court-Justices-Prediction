justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
enough,
mr.
karpe,
if
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
were
automatic
weapons
on
the
premises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
that
in
all
drug
arrest
cases
that
we
should
assume
there
are
automatic
weapons
present?
it
seems
to
me
if
you
are
you
may
be
suggesting
an
automatic
rule
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that.
i'm
saying
if
the
application
for
a
warrant
indicates
that
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
people
who
have
the
drugs
also
are
armed
with
automatic
weapons,
would
that
justify
a
no-knock
entry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
those
are
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
facts
are
that
there
are
three
men
in
the
premises,
in
the
motel
room.
it
is
known
that
they
have
automatic
weapons.
they
have
a
large
quantity
of
drugs
with
them.
that's
all.
they
don't
know
anything
about
their
criminal
history,
but
they
know
they're
armed
in
that
way.
would
that
justify
a
no-knock
entry,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
would
it
be
justified,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
more
than
i've
told
you?
what
would
be
an
additional
circumstance
that
would
justify
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
take
them
to
the
hotel
room
when
they're
in
wisconsin.
[laughter]
i
think
your
reluctance
to
answer
the
question
to
indicate
that
the
police
have
the
right
to
enter
when
automatic
weapons
are
present
is
because
you
think
we're
going
to
say,
oh,
well,
that's
a
per
se
rule.
but
at
some
level
you
have
to
have
certain
standards
and
rules
given
by
this
court
for
the
police
officer
to
act
upon,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
presence
of
weapons
is
a
perfectly
sensible
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
doyle,
if
you're
correct
that
the
videotapes
would
show
the
same
scenario
regardless
of
whether
there's
a
knock
or
no-knock,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
no-knock...
that
the
requirement
of
a
knock
doesn't
really
harm
the
law
enforcement
operation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
destruction
of
evidence,
would
it
not
be
true
that
in
every
drug
case
there
is
a
possibility
that
some
of
the
drugs
will
be
flushed
down
the
toilet--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
that
therefore
you
don't
really
have
to
rely
on
the
violence
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
really,
general
doyle,
is
if
the
potential
for
destruction
of
evidence
is
sufficient
by
itself
to
justify
no-knock,
why
shouldn't
the
rule
encompass
even
misdemeanor
cases,
because
there
always
is
that
potential
there,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
ever
weigh
the
other
way
if
the
destruction
of
evidence
is
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she's
fast
enough
to
get
to
the
bathroom
in
10
seconds.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
suggesting
that
you
rule
out...
you
say
you
never
need
to
knock-and-announce
if
destruction
of
evidence
is
a
sufficient
exigent
circumstance.
i
don't
know
why
you
ever
have
to
knock
and
announce,
because
there's
always
the
danger,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you
get
some
drugs
flushed
down
the
toilet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
doyle,
isn't
it
true
that
just
as
there
are
no
statistics
comparing
the
relative
danger
with
a
knock
and
without
a
knock,
isn't
it
also
true
that
there
are
at
least
some
drug
cases
in
which
it's
the
grandmother
example
and
the
marijuana
growing
in
the
backyard,
and
there
really
isn't
any
statistical
study
telling
us
what
percentage
are
the
dangerous
ones
and
what
percentage
are
the
relatively
not
dangerous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
going
to
say
they
generally
would
not
bust
in
in
those
cases,
but
they
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
so
under
your
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
take...
say
you're
not
in
a
drug
case
but
a
financial
crime
or
something
like
that,
and
the
police
had
a
warrant,
went
in
without
knocking
or
announcing,
and
the
defendant
proved
just
that,
that
this
was
a
financial
crimes
case,
and
they
came
in
with
a
warrant,
but
they
did
not
knock
and
announce.
would
that
have
satisfied
their
burden?
