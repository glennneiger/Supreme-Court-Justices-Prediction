justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
karpe,
on
that
striking
feature
of
this
case,
here
it
was
the
affidavit
of
the
police
with...
asking
for
permission
for
no-knock,
and
the
united
states
struck
that
out.
is
that
a
common
thing
to
include
in
affidavits,
and
how
does
it...
is
it
ordinarily
taken
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i'm
asking,
maybe
you
don't
know
the
answer
to
this
question,
is,
is
it
standard
operating
procedure
in
wisconsin
for
the
police
to
ask
for
no-knock
permission?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
a
matter
of
practice,
do
police...
is
this
a
common
form
of
affidavit?
do
police
ask
for
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
it
also
often
that
the
judge
x's
it
out,
the
magistrate
x's
it
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
a
statute
that
settles
it
like
the
two
that
are
in
the
appendix
to
this
amicus
brief
from
americans
for
effective
law
enforcement,
that
gives
the
magistrate
authority,
if
he
finds
two
things,
one
that
there's
a
danger
to
life
and
limb,
and
that
the...
or
that
the
property
sought
may
be
easily
or
quickly
destroyed?
is
that
statute,
those
two
statutes
constitutional,
where
the
magistrate
relieves
the
officer
of
the
decision
to
be
made
on
the
spot
by
authorizing
in
the
warrant
a
no-knock
search
if
these
conditions...
if
the
magistrate
finds
these
conditions
present,
that
the
property
sought
can
be
quickly
destroyed,
or
that
there's
danger
to
life
and
limb
of
the
officer
or
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
doyle,
there
are
two
questions
that
i
have
with
respect
to
your
argument
about
how
complicated
this
will
be.
one
is,
what
do
we
do
about
wilson,
where
it
was
a
drug
case,
and
where
the
police
knew
in
advance
that
she
was
armed?
was
that
just
an
idle
exercise?
and
the
second
question
is,
in
this
very
case
there
was
one
justice
on
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
who
said,
i
think
that
no-knock
is
generally
required,
but
it's
obvious
that
in
this
case
it
could
be
dispensed
with,
so
it
didn't
seem
like
it's
a
very
complicated
exercise
if
you
apply
the
rule,
and
if
you
don't
apply
the
rule,
aren't
we
just
gutting
what
we
said
a
couple
of
years
ago?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
said
that
in
the
case
of
a
drug
offense
in
which
the
police
were
told
that
the
person
they
were
going
in
to
apprehend
was
armed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
review
a
judgment,
not
an
opinion,
so
i
take
it
from
what
you're
saying
today
that
we
really
should
have
affirmed,
not
remanded
in
wilson,
because
the
factors
that
you're
arguing
for...
drug
offense,
arms...
were
present.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
estrada,
one
of
the
things
that
chief
judge
abrahamson
said
in
her
concurring
opinion
was,
well,
if
you're
going
to
go
by
danger
to
the
police
officer,
more
police
officers
are
killed
responding
to
calls,
domestic
violence
calls
than
in
drug
raids,
so
if
it's
danger
to
the
police
officer
and
you
could
have
a
blanket
rule
for
drug
raids,
why
not
a
blanket
rule
for
domestic
violence
situations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
statistics
that
inform
the
officer,
if
you're
going
to
respond
to
one
of
those
calls,
you're
walking
into
a
very
dangerous
situation
where
your
life
is
going
to
be
on
the
line.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
just
wondering
why
we
can't
have
blanket
rules
for
all
these
dangerous
situations.
what
is
it
about
the
drug
raid
that
distinguishes
it
from
others
if
danger
to
the
police
officer
is
our
standard?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
karpe,
suppose
we
were
to
take
wisconsin's
fallback
position
that
not
in
every
drug
case,
but
at
least
when
the
object
of
the
warrant
is
a
drug
dealer,
at
least
in
drug
dealer
cases
as
opposed
to
houses
known
to
have
drugs,
where
you're
dealing
with
a
drug
dealer,
you
can
infer
that
there
will
be
arms,
you
can
infer
that
there's
going
to
be
an
effort
to
destroy
evidence,
so
why
not...
and
that's
a
narrower
rule
than
any
drug
case.
why
won't
that
work?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
narrowing
it,
as
i
think
general
doyle
did
in
the
brief,
to
a
known
drug
dealer.
in
the
case
of
a
drug
dealer,
somebody
who
distributes
grand-scale
drugs,
drug
dealers
more
often
than
not
will
have
guns,
and
more
often
than
not
will
try
to
destroy
evidence
if
they
have
notice,
so
we'll
narrow
it...
remove
your
two
kids
in
a
college
dorm
and
just
take
the
dealer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i'm
taking
all
those
cases
out,
and
we're
concentrating
on
the
dealer.
