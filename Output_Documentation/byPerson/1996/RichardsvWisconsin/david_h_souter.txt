justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
the
converse
would
be
true.
the
court
might
very
well
have
said,
you've
got
to
knock,
but
if
they
get
to
the
porch
and
they
hear
guns
being
fired
inside,
i
take
it
it
would
be
quite
reasonable
for
them
to
say,
we're
not
going
to
knock,
we're
going
to
go
in
like
gang-busters,
and
you
wouldn't
have
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
yet
that
is
a
standard
reason
for
applying
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine,
and
if
exigent
circumstances
may
be
applied,
why
can't
the
kind
of
pre-warrant
determination
that
the
statute
refers
to
and
that
justice
ginsburg
refers
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
a
danger
in
application,
i
suppose,
to
exigent
circumstances,
because
it
depends
upon
a
judgment
made
on
the
spot.
this
is
somewhat
less
dangerous,
because
it's
not
being...
a
judgment
made
in
the
heat
of
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
are
they
going
to
turn
off...
you
mean,
they're
going
to
go
into
the
basement
of
the
building
and
turn
the
water--
--you
must
have
these
fancy
new
toilets
in
your
home.
ours
has
a
tank.
you
can
shut
off
the
water.
you
get
one
flush
anyway.
[laughter]
you've
got
to
try
something
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
ask
you
whether
we're
talking
about
anything
but
formality,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
these
points.
i
assume
that
most
drug
cases
do
have
a
suppression
hearing.
it
may
be
a
simple
one.
it
may
not
take
very
long,
but
usually
there's
a
suppression
motion.
number
2,
on
the
very
premises
of
your
argument,
if
you
have
to
justify
the
failure
to
knock
and
announce,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
do
it,
i
would
assume,
without
too
much
trouble.
in
fact,
i
assume
you
could
do
it
with
virtually
no
trouble
in
most
cases.
there
will
occasionally
be
a
rare
case
in
which,
for
example,
the
informant
has
told
you
there
are
no
guns,
the
marijuana
is
stored
in
bales
out
in
the
barn
so
that
there's
no
risk
of
destruction,
and
in
those
rare
cases
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
justify
the
failure
to
knock
and
announce,
but
in
most
of
them
you
could.
so
are
we
talking
really
about
the
need
for
anything
more
than
dispensing
with
what
is
probably
in
most
cases
almost
a
formality
in
the
proof
that
you
will
adduce,
the
evidence
that
you
will
adduce
at
the
suppression
hearing?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
let's
assume
this
court
says,
look,
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
recognize
that
in
most
cases
involving
drug
dealers
the
state
will
in
fact
have
valid
grounds
for
dispensing
with
knock-and-announce,
because
the
marijuana
won't
be
in
the
barn
and
the
informant
will
not
have
said,
these
people
are
unarmed.
so
that
we
said,
we
recognize
that
in
most
cases
they'll
be
able
to
make
their
proof
without
great
difficulty,
but
we're
not
going
to
adopt
a
blanket
rule
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
we
do
we're
going
to
be
starting
down
the
road
to
more
blanket
exceptions,
and
more
blanket
exceptions
after
that.
so
that
in
order
to
preserve
the
particularized
inquiry
value,
which
is
a
real
value
in
the
long
run,
we're
still
going
to
require
the
state
in
effect
to
make
its
proof
knowing
perfectly
well
that
the
state
can
do
it
in
most
cases.
now,
that,
i
take
it,
would
be
a
fairly
benign
atmosphere
for
you
to
present
your
proof
in
individual
cases.
assuming
we
said
something
like
that,
are
we
then
in
this
case
arguing
about
anything
much
more
than
a
formality?
