justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
if,
in
addition
to
the
evidence
that
was
presented
at
the
time
you
terminated
the
disability
there
had
been
evidence
that
the
higher
paying
job
would
only
last
6
years,
say,
and
then
he
would
be
working
as
a
night
watchman,
as
you
say,
and
therefore
you
could
make
certain
computations.
would
you
say
that
the
alj
should
then
give
an
award
that
reflected...
that
would
stay
in
effect
indefinitely,
or
could
he
give
a
nominal
damage
award
in
that
kind
of
case
to
be
adjusted
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
you
think
he
should
do.
he
should
overcompensate
temporarily
and
then
perhaps
undercompensate
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
also
extend
the
period
of...
for
that
modification
indefinitely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
difference
is,
you'd
be
overcompensating
before
you
knew
the
real
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i'm
repeating
a
point
justice
scalia
has
made
before,
but
the
burden
of
the...
in
the
particular
proceeding
seeking
modification
that
was
had
in
this
case
was
one
in
which
the
employer
assumed
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
should
be
a
complete
termination
of
benefits,
and
the
alj
found
that
that
burden
of
proof
had
been
sustained.
if
that's
true,
that
would
even
rule
out
the
nominal
award.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
was
increase
in
earnings,
and
also
there
was
testimony
that
the
man
might
theoretically
lose
his
job
later,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
part
of
the
problem
is
that
your
client
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings
did
not
argue
in
the
alternative,
a)
don't
make
any
reduction,
and
b)
if
you
do
make
a
reduction,
don't
terminate
but
allow
me
to
keep
the
nominal
award.
he
didn't
even
raise
that
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
i
was
very
sympathetic
to
his
position,
but
he
lost.
