we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-272,
metropolitan
stevedore
company
v.
rambo.
mr.
babcock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
doctor
were
to
say,
he
can
keep
going
in
my
view
for
probably
5
years,
but
after
that
he's
going
to
go
down?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
more
would
he
need?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
could
all
be
determined
at
the
present
time
on
the
basis
of
the
doctor's
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
your
theory,
and
justice
kennedy's
facts,
you
say
no
nominal
award
could
be
made
but
an
award
of
money
damages
not
nominal
could
be
made.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
some
situations
in
which
you
would
agree
that
even
though
there's
no
present
loss
of
earning
power
on
appropriate
evidence
an
award
for
the
future
could
be
made.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
would
that...
suppose
he
says
you've
lost
nothing
now,
but
in
3
years
i
find
that
you
will
have
lost
30
percent
on
the
evidence.
when
would
that
award
kick
in,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
just
to
clarify
your
answer--
--that
would
extend
the
statute
indefinitely,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
babcock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
just
in...
because
it
felt
bound
by
court
of
appeals
decisions,
or
on
its
own?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eighties
when
the
benefits
review
board
was
taken...
did
they
simply
direct
the
award
of
nominal
damages
on
their
own
when
the
benefits
review
board
had
said
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
came
from
the
court
of
appeals,
though.
it
didn't
come
from
the
benefit
review
board?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
pierry,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
alj
has
to
write
down
and
deal
with
every
single
one
of
those
sections
under
section
908
in
making
an
award?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
your
view
is
that
the
alj
simply
has
to
use
kind
of
a
checklist--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
every
one
of
these
things
that
are
mentioned
in
908(h)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
could
skip
some
of
them,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
most.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
alj
simply
found...
simply
made
a
finding
that
i've
reviewed
all
of
the
factors
set
forth
in
section
908(h)
and
find
no
loss
of
earning
capacity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
difficult?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
provision
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
require
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
if
you
were
going
to
argue
it
you
probably
would
have
it
before
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
no
idea
what
the
section
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
a
divorce
for
child
support
or
alimony
certainly
one
of
the
primary
issues
is
the
earning
capacity
of
each
spouse.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
typical
divorce
statutes
in
states
make
exactly
the
same
provision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
put
it
that
way,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
you
agree
that
the
burden
in
this
case
is
on
the
employer,
and
what
the
employer
has
to
show
is
that
it's
less
likely
than
not
that
there
will
be
a
future
impairment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pierry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
