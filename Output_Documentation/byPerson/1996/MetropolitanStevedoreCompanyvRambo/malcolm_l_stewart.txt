mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
director
of
the
office
of
worker's
compensation
programs
is
that
a
continuing
nominal
award
is
appropriate
whenever
an
injured
claimant
has
no
current
loss
of
earnings
but
is
more
likely
than
not
to
suffer
a
loss
of
wages
at
some
point
in
the
future
as
a
result
of
a
covered
injury.
we
believe;
however,
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
this
case
in
ordering
a
continuing
nominal
award.
now,
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
continuing
nominal
awards,
i
think
the
heart
of
our
submission
is
that
such
an
award
in
appropriate
cases
is
not
an
extrastatutory
device,
it's
an
award
given
to
the
claimant
who
satisfies
all
of
the
statutory
prerequisites
for
an
award
of
benefits,
and
for
that
proposition
we
would
rely
primarily
on
the
language
of
section
908(h),
which
is
reproduced
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
we
think
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
think
that
in
determining
an
award
that
is
reasonable
the
administrative
law
judge
should
take
cognizance
of
the
entirety
of
the
statutory
scheme.
now,
if
there
were
no
provision
for
a
modification
of
awards,
if
the
award
that
was
originally
entered
by
the
alj
was
to
be
the
award
for
the
rest
of
the
claimant's
life
no
matter
what
condition
changed,
then
the
alj's
only
alternative
would
be
to
do
as
you
suggest,
which
is
take
its
best
shot
at
estimating
the
loss
that
the
claimant
would
incur
over
the
course
of
his
lifetime
and
enter
an
award
which
was
designed
to
compensate
him
for
that
loss
even
though
that
would
mean
overcompensation
in
the
early
years
and
perhaps
undercompensation
in
the
future.
the
great
virtue
of
section
922's
modification
provision
is
that
it
sharply
reduces
the
need
for
speculation.
the
alj
can
enter
a
nominal
award,
the
nominal
award
will
preserve
the
claimant's
right
to
seek
modification
down
the
road,
and
at
the
same
time
it
will
avoid
the
risk
of
overcompensation
that
would
occur
if
the
claimant
got--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
been
around
since
approximately
1980
or
so.
the
first
court
of
appeals
decision
that
approved
the
concept
was
hole,
which
was
issued
in
1981
by
the
fifth
circuit,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
date
of
the
alj
decision,
but
it
would
have
been
approximately
1980,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--for...
during
the
1980's,
the
benefits
review
board
repeatedly
issued
opinions
that
disapproved
of
the
practice
of
continuing
nominal
awards.
however,
starting
in
1990,
the
benefits
review
board,
albeit
without
much
explanation,
has
reversed
course,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
was
on
its
own,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is,
we
cited
at
page
20,
footnote
8
of
our
brief
the
relevant
benefits
review
board's...
board
decisions,
and
one
of
those
was
a
case
called
morin,
m-o-r-i-n,
and
that
case
arose
out
of
maine,
and
there
was
no
first
circuit
decision
on
point
that
addressed
the
question
of
continuing
nominal
awards,
so
i
think
the
fact
that
the
board
in
morin
evidently
regarded
the
practice
of
continuing
nominal
awards
as
legitimate
indicates
that
it
wasn't
simply
acquiescing
in
binding
circuit
court
decisions
in
the
relevant
circuits.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
was
certainly
influenced
by
other
circuits,
but
during
the
1980's,
even
when
the
board
was
expressing
general
opposition
to
continuing
nominal
awards,
when
a
case
would
arise
in
a
circuit
in
which
there
was
binding
circuit
precedent
saying
continuing
nominal
awards
are
appropriate
the
board
would
say,
despite
our
disagreement,
we
feel
obligated
to
apply
the
standard
announced
by
the
relevant
court
of
appeals
and
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
they
would
typically
remand
to
the
alj
for...
they
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
didn't
come
from
the
benefits
review
board.
it
came
initially,
i
would
say,
from
an
alj,
because
in
hole,
the
first
court
of
appeals
case
that
approved
it,
the
alj
had
fashioned
a
nominal
award.
the
benefit...
and
the
court
of
appeals
approved
that
practice.
but
during
the
period
of
the
1980's
when
the
courts
of
appeals
were
generally
approving
this
practice,
it
was
over
the
objection
of
the
benefits
review
board.
now,
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
i
mean,
we
believe
that
the
standard
at
any
given
time
is
whether
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
claimant
will
suffer
a
loss
of
earnings
at
some
point
in
the
future,
and
even
if
a
nominal
award
were
entered
at
one
point,
if
years
went
by
and
in
fact
the
claimant
showed
that
he
was
able
to
keep
his
higher
paying
job,
the
employer
could
move
for
a
modification
on
the
ground
that
it
was
now
no
longer
more
likely
or
not
that
the
claimant
would
suffer
a
loss
of
earnings
at
some
point
in
the
future.
in
further
response
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
about
where
these
awards
came
from,
historically
they
came
from
the
alj
and
then
were
approved
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
think
in
terms
of
where
in
the
statute
does
the
authority
reside,
there
are
really
two
provisions
of
section
908(h)
that
we
think
are
relevant.
the
first
is
the
provision
that
says
the
alj
in
determining
wage-earning
capacity
should
look
to
the
effect
of
disability
as
it
may
naturally
extend
into
the
future,
and
we
think
that
provision
would
be
meaningless
if
the
alj
were
required
to
set
wage-earning
capacity
by
reference
to
the
wages
that
the
employee
was
currently
capable
of
earning.
and
with
respect
to
the
question,
why
can
the
alj
award
nominal
benefits
as
opposed
to
taking
a
shot
at
estimating
likely
losses
in
the
future,
we
think
the
statute
gives
the
alj
wide
discretion
in
that
it
says
that
the
alj
may,
in
the
interest
of
justice,
fix
such
wage-earning
capacity
as
shall
be
reasonable,
and
we
think
that
encompasses
the
freedom
not
only
to
weigh
the
facts,
but
also
to
consider
the
totality
of
a
statutory
scheme.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
we
do
think
so.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
entering
a
nominal
award
on
its
own
precisely
because
the
resolution
of
that
question
would
depend
on
factual
findings
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
competent
to
make.
i
mean,
essentially,
as
a
practical
matter
we
know
that
mr.
rambo
is
not
going
to
earn
less
than
he
was
earning
at
the
time
of
his
injury
for
so
long
as
he
continues
his
current
job
as
a
crane
operator,
but
since
there's
been
no
showing
that
his
physical
condition
has
changed,
if
he
should
lose
his
job
as
a
crane
operator
and
be
unable
to
find
similar
work,
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
will
be
impaired
in
his
ability
to
obtain
alternative
longshore
employment.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
that's
not
our
position,
with
respect.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
in
determining
whether
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
mr.
rambo
will
at
some
point
in
the
future
suffer
a
loss
of
wages
as
a
result
of
the
injury,
in
this
case
really
the
dispositive
question
is,
how
likely
is
it
that
he
will
some
day
lose
his
crane
operator's
job.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
one
thing
that
the
alj
left
out
is,
the
alj
said,
he
is
no
more
likely
to
lose
his
crane
operator's
job
than
anyone
else,
presumably
as
a
result
of
his
injury,
but
if
it
were
the
case
that
work
as
a
crane
operator
was
inherently
unstable,
that
anyone
working
in
the
field
could
be
expected
to
lose
his
job
at
any
moment,
that
could
be
true,
but
it
might--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
in
this
case
i
think
metropolitan,
as
the
proponent
of
the
order
terminating
benefits,
would
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
thank
you.
