justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
it
seems
to
me
it
responds
to
this
problem.
we
might
indeed
all
agree
that
there
is
some
degree
of
probability
or
possibility
that
the
individual
in
the
future
is
going
to
suffer
in
fact
an
incapacity
which
right
now
is
subject
to
so
many
contingencies
that
nobody
could
reasonably
estimate
it.
so
we
in
effect
say
yes,
there
is
a
possibility
there,
but
it's
a
very
tiny
one,
and
we
don't
know
how
to
give
it
a
more
specific
figure
than
that,
therefore
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
give
it
a
very
tiny
award.
give
it
a
dollar.
that's
a
nominal
award
which
in
fact
reflects
a
nominal
possibility,
or
a
nominal
probability.
why
isn't
that
consistent
with
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
act
speaks
of
disability
in
the
future,
and
on
the
hypothesis
i
was
giving
there
is
a
very
slight
chance,
there
is
some
chance,
more
than
zero,
that
there
will
be
a
disability
in
the
future,
because
in
fact
something
the
individual
used
to
be
able
to
do
to
earn
his
living
he
can
no
longer
do
now,
so
that
there
is
something
more
than
zero.
so
on
that
assumption
there
is
a
finding
of
a
possibility,
more
than
zero,
of
some
disability
in
the
future.
consistent
with
that
is
to
give
a
nominal
award
of
something
more
than
zero,
but
not
much,
to
reflect
that
disability.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
defines
it
as
a
present
one,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
shouldn't
i
just...
i
think
probably
i
should
have
changed
my
hypothesis
and
said;
the
fact
that
we
can
make
this
probability
or
possibility
judgment
about
what
will
eventuate
at
a
future
time
is
reflective
of
a
nominal
disability
now.
isn't
that
a)
both
consistent
with
the
act
and,
as
you
say,
fair?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
take
the
hypothesis
in
which
he
can
become
a
crane
operator,
or
heavy
equipment
operator,
whatever
it
was,
tomorrow,
so
that
you
say
there's
no
disability
here.
he's
earning
three
times
his
former
wages.
assume
that
we
know,
for
whatever
reason,
that
that
work,
at
least
in
the
area
where
he
is,
is
probably
going
to
exist
for
only
about
6
months.
i
take
it
on
your
theory
there
would
be
no
present
disability,
because
for
the
immediate...
he
has
the
immediate
prospect
of
earning
money
even
though
we
know
on
the
hypo
that
in
6
months
he'll
be...
he
won't
be
able
to
earn
the
heavy
equipment
money,
nor
will
he
be
able
to
go
back
to
his
lifting
job.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
it's
a
question
of
degree,
then,
because
that...
in
theory
that's
not
different
from
the
earlier
example.
the
earlier
example
recognizes
the
possibility
of
something
that
may
happen
in
the
future,
whereas
the
example
of
the
6-month
heavy
equipment
job
recognizes
a
near
certainty,
so
i
take
it
the
difference
is,
is
simply
one
of
the
predictive
degree.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
evidence
in
the
first
case
is
that
he
cannot
go
back
to
lifting.
there
are
some
things
that
he
used
to
be
able
to
do
that
in
the
future
he
will
not
be
able
to
do.
there's
an
evidentiary
basis
for
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
for
the
present
time
the
disability
is
at
most
of
nominal
value,
so
put
a
nominal
value
on
it.
why
do
you
say
he
has
a
disability?
i
thought
he
doesn't
have
a
disability
until
you
establish
that
he
has
a
reduction
in
earning
capacity.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
also
concede,
i
take
it,
that
although
he
can
do
the
crane
operation,
it
is
possible...
you
would
dispute
it
on
these
facts,
but
it
is
perfectly
possible
and
legally
appropriate
to
find
that
his
present
crane-operating
capacity
is
not
reasonably
reflective
of
his
overall
earning
capacity.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be
a
reason,
then,
for
saying
that
this
individual...
if
the
alj's
finding
in
that
respect
is
not
disturbed,
that
this
individual
shouldn't
have
gotten
his
nominal
damages,
but
it
would
still
leave
the
door
open
for
nominal
damages
had
the
alj
said,
a)
at
the
present
time
he
can
earn
three
times
as
much,
so
that
there
is
not
in
fact
in
actuality
right
at
the
moment
a
loss
of
earnings,
but
b)
this
capacity
to
earn
is
not
reflective
of
his
earning
capacity
for
the
long
haul,
and
therefore
i
want
to
put
a
figure
on
what
the
capacity
is.
it's
hard
to
put
a
figure
on
it,
because
there
are
so
many
future
contingencies,
so
i'm
simply
going
to
say,
there
is
some
possibility,
and
reflect
that
some
possibility
in
a
nominal
award.
that
theoretically
would
be
possible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
we
doing
anything
more
than
arguing
about
words,
because
i
would
suppose,
even
on
your
theory,
if
the
judge
said,
i
find
that
there
is
a
probability
that
in
the
future
the
job
market
will
change,
restrict
his
opportunities,
so
that
that
amounts
in
today's
terms
to
a
1-percent
chance
of
disability
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
give
him
damages
equal
to
or
an
award
that
reflects
the
1-percent
chance,
he
could
do
that
on
your
theory,
couldn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
when
you
say
probable,
when
you
talk
about
the
probability
judgment,
the
probability
judgment
is
not
a
probability
judgment
that
there
will
be
work
as
a
crane
operator
and
he
will
continue
to
do
it,
or
be
unable
to
continue
to
do
it,
the
probability
judgment
simply
is
that
there
is
one
kind
of
wage
earning
physical
activity
that
he
cannot
do
now,
and
so
long
as
that
probability
is
shown,
the
nominal
damage
award
is
appropriate.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
be
unable
to
continue
to
operate
cranes,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
your
answer
to
that
is,
send
it
back
so
that
findings
can
be
made
on
some
of
these
various
factors
that
the
court...
that
the
alj
did
not
specifically
address.
that
was
your
earlier
answer,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
start
all
over
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
same
language
could
be
honored
by
simply
assigning
present
value
and
saying
that's
good
for
all
time.
we
may
be
giving
you
too
much
now
and
too
little
later
on
a
specific
time
period
basis,
but
we'll
fix
a
present
value
just
the
way
juries
fix
present
values
in
accident
cases.
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
statute,
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
maybe
they
could
simply
be
treated
as
nominal
requests
and
knocked
down.
it
wouldn't
take
much
time,
and
the
rights
would
be
preserved.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
you
say
that
he
meets
or
can
meet
that
standard
simply
by
proof
that
among
the
spectrum
of
things
that
he
might
do
to
earn
a
living,
there
is
one
thing
that
he
can
no
longer
do
as
well
as
he
did
before,
and
therefore,
given
the
contingencies
of
job
availability,
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
it
is
more
probable
than
not
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
earn
what
he
did
before,
and
that
satisfies
the
burden.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
will...
i
guess
that
takes
me
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
except
for
the
employee
who
in
fact
fully
recovers,
your
theory
will
always
support
a
nominal
award.
