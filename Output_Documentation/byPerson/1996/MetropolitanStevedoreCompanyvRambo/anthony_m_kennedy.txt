well,
could
you
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
under
section
22?
what
is
it
in
the
language
of...
let's
assume
that
there's
a
significant
probability
that
there
will
be
a
loss
of
earnings
in
the
future.
he
doesn't
have
the
earnings
loss
now.
he's
going
to
be
earning
higher
wages
for
5
years.
but
we
want
to...
but
the
alj
says
we
should
give
nominal
damages.
what
in
22
prevents
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
my
hypothetical
was
that
there...
was
that
he
does
give
the
nominal
award
under
these
circumstances.
he
says,
in
5
years
you're
not
going
to
be
having
any
earnings
power.
this
is
significantly
likely,
and
in
5
years
i
want
you
to
come
back
and
i'll
look
at
it
again,
so
i'll
give
you
a
nominal
award.
what
in
22
prevents
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
period
of
time
is
1
year
after
the
last
payment
is
made,
and
if
a
nominal
award
continues
to
be
paid,
then
that
is
satisfied,
correct?
