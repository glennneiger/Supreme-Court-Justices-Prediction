justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
a
case
that's
not
hypothetical
so
we
won't
be
talking
about
this
in
the
abstract.
somebody
is
physically
injured,
a
severe
back
and
leg
injury,
as
in
this
case,
is
promoted
from
the
line
job
that
he
can
no
longer
do
to
a
manager's
office,
and
the
alj
thinks
there's
a
good
chance,
better
than
not
chance
that
this
guy
just
won't
make
it,
and
within
2,
3
years
he'll
be
out
of
work.
from
the
answer
you've
given
to
justice
o'connor
and
justice
scalia,
i
take
it
you
would
say
tough
luck.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
figure
would
you
fix...
this
man
is
earning
as
a
manager
twice
what
he
earned
in
the
factory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
would
you
fix
a
figure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
babcock,
if
we
can't
get
that
from
the
words
themselves,
is
there
support...
for
example,
has
the
benefit
review
board
addressed
this
question
of
nominal
damages?
do
we
have
any
opinion
at
the
administrative
level
or
from
another
court
that
says
the
nominal
damages
theory
is
no
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
benefits
review
board
hasn't
rejected
the
concept?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
could
an
employer
ever
cut
this
out
by
saying...
take
this
case.
for
5
years
he's
continued
to
work
as
a
crane
operator,
we
now
again
ask
for
a
changed
circumstances
ruling,
to
cut
out
the
nominal
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
you're
suggesting
is
it
would
be
a
routine
thing,
and
more
formal
than
substantial,
if
it's
just
that,
i
list
these
things,
i've
considered
every
one
of
them,
and
that's
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
do
you
mean?
two
sentences
is
substantial,
or...
let
me
ask
you
another
question,
which
i
think
you
answered,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
have
your
answer
right.
the
law
was
less
than
clear
and
certain
on
nominal
damages.
the
benefits
review
board
resisted
it
for
a
long
time,
and
the
circuits
didn't
get
into
it
until
the
eighties.
is
it
clear
that
in
this
very
case
that
issue
was
focused
before
the
alj
so
that
when
mr.
rambo,
who
was
receiving
weekly
benefits
as
a
disabled
person,
was
threatened
with
the
termination
of
his
benefits,
the
alj
knew
that
that
was
one
of
the
things
he
could
have
done?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
his
lawyer
in
that
modification
proceeding
initiated
by
the
employer,
did
rambo's
lawyer
ever
say
to
the
alj
at
least
give
us
an
award
of
nominal
damages?
did
it
enter
the
fray
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pierry,
isn't
it
how
can
we
drop
out
922?
isn't
this
whole
idea
driven
by
the
1-year
time
limit?
if
we
didn't
have
the
1-year
time
limit
there
would
be
no
need
for
these
nominal
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
part
of
the
problem
that
the
1-year
time
limit
works
as
a
one-way
street?
that
is,
the
employer
can
always
come
in
and
say,
we
want
a
modification,
and
the
employee--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pierry--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
pierry,
is
it...
isn't
it
so
that
anybody
who
has
a
physical
disability,
as
rambo
certainly
did,
anybody
who
has
that,
can
always
get
one
of
these
nominal
damages
award,
because
there
would
always
be
a
risk
that
at
some
time
in
the
future
their
disability,
physical
disability
would
make
it
impossible
even
to
do,
say,
the
crane
work?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'd
like
to
see
what
is
the
stopping
point
on
your
theory.
the
government
has
the
more-probable-than-not,
but
on
your
theory,
isn't
there
always
a
risk
that
the
disabling
condition
will
cause
a
reduction
in
earning
capacity?
