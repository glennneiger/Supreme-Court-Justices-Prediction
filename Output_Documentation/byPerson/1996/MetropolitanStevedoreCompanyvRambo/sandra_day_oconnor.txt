justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
would
be
improper
for
the
alj
to
ever
make
such
an
award?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
certainly
the...
i
guess
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
the
respondents
that
in
interpreting
the
act
and
the
language
of
the
statute
that
such
an
award
is
possible,
focusing
on
the
language
of
section
908(h).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
babcock,
what
do
we
do
here
in
this
case
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
in
some
appropriate
case
it
is
possible
to
determine
future
economic
harm
as
a
disability
for
someone
that
would
entitle
that
person
to
some
nominal
damages
award?
do
we
have
to
vacate
and
remand
here
so
that
that
can...
the
alj
can
at
least
answer
the
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
if
we
determine
that
it
is
possible
that
an
administrative
law
judge
could
determine
in
a
case
that
there
is
future
economic
harm
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--not
at
the
moment,
but
from
the
evidence.
the
job
isn't
going
to
last,
and
there's
future
economic
harm.
therefore,
a
nominal
award
at
present
is
appropriate.
what
do
we
do
in
this
case,
because
you
didn't
present
any
alternative
argument
below.
you
just
wanted
all
or
nothing.
you...
never
can
you
have
a
nominal
award.
and
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
it
is
possible,
what
do
we
do
at
the
bottom
line
in
this
case
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
have
to
send
it
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
mr.
babcock,
if
you
look
at
section
908(h),
the
proviso
at
least
tells
us
that
you
have
to
look
at
what
might
affect
his
capacity
to
earn
wages
in
his
disabled
condition,
including
the
effect
of
disability
as
it
may
naturally
extend
into
the
future,
so
there
is
certainly
some
language
in
the
act
that
directs
one's
attention
to
future
earning
capacity.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
here
said
it
was
enough
if
there's
a
significant
possibility
of
future
economic
harm.
i
think
other
jurisdictions
don't
apply
a
possibility
but
say
that
you
have
to
have
proof
that
it's
more
probable
than
not.
do
you
have
a
position
on
that,
and
is
there
a
majority
position
in
the
circuits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that
wasn't
the
board's
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
defend
the
ninth
circuit
standard
of
a
possibility
instead
of
a
probability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
certainly
is
not
what
most
courts
have
followed,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
so
what's
the
employer's
burden
of
proof
on
a
modification
request?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
what
i
asked
you.
the
ninth
circuit
refers
to
a
possibility
rather
than
a
probability,
and
you
said
you
support
that.
