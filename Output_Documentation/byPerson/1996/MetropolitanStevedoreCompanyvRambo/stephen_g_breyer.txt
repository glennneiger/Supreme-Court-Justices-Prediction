justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
the
question
i
have.
i
mean,
because
i
want
to
know
what...
obviously,
this
particular
man
was
earning
$500
a
week
before
he
was
hurt.
now
he's
earning
$1,500
a
week
after
he's
hurt,
so
it's...
he
may
not
be
a
person
who
will
end
up
being
benefited
by
this.
but
how
do
you
write
it?
that
is
to
say,
i'm
interested
in
the
solicitor
general's
argument.
the
solicitor
general
is
saying
that
it
could
happen,
that
all
the
doctors
say
he
goes
along
for
3
years,
then
it's
collapse,
right?
so
prove
he
is
a
person
who
will...
prove
he
will
lose
a
lot
of
money.
imagine
that's
our
case,
but
we
don't
know
now.
they
say,
this
is
a
perfectly
sensible
way
to
do
it.
give
him
$1
a
week
now.
if
and
when
he
loses
all
the
money,
we'll
give
him
more
later.
they
say,
it's
sensible
to
do
that,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
stops
it.
you
say
that's
inconsistent
with
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
part
of
the
act
is
it
inconsistent
with?
what
words
is
it
inconsistent
with?
that's
what
i
cannot
find.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
the
words
that
make
it
inconsistent,
because
i
don't
see
in
section
22,
that
i
have
here,
an
inconsistency.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
has
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
is
incapacitated
to
earn
wages.
he
will,
in
all
likelihood,
earn
his
present
wage
from
3
to
8
years,
and
then
boom,
he
earns
nothing.
fourteen
doctors
testify
that
that's
the
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
in
the
act,
any
language
in
the
act
that
says
what
you
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
my
question
assumed
that
there
is
a
probability.
my
question
is
assuming
it's
certain,
98
percent
certain
you
go
along
for
5
years,
then
you
fall
over,
can't
do
another
day's
work,
so
there's
no
problem
of
proof.
then
is
there
something
in
this
act
that
would
prevent
what
sounds
like
a
reasonable
administrative
system?
we'll
give
you
a
dollar
a
week
until
you
keel
over,
and
if
and
when
you
do,
we'll
up
the
ante.
now,
that's
what
the
sg
is
arguing
we
should
write
an
opinion
to
embody,
and
i
want
to
know
what
you
think,
what
language
or
practice
prevents
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
did
this
come
from?
is
this
something
the...
i
mean,
his
objection,
i
think,
your
opponent's,
to
this
system
is
it's
a
kind
of
gimmick
that's
been
hoked
up
here
in
order
to
create
this
thing,
nominal
awards.
the
statute
says
do
it
just
the
way
justice
scalia
comes
up
with
saying,
and
it
will
come
to
the
same
result
in
virtually
every
case,
so
why
are
we
going
through
this?
the
response
would
be,
that's
how
the
board
wants
to
do
it,
but
where
does
it
come
from?
is
this
something
that
is
recent?
have
they
made
up
this
nominal
damages
in
this
way
in
this
case,
or
is
there
a
history
behind
it?
where
does
this
all
come
from,
this
interpretation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so...
i
haven't
even
thought
about...
what's
bothering
me
in
the
statutory
part
of
this
case
is
that
i
guess
mr.
babcock
says,
read
that
statute.
they
have
some
words
called
wage-earning
capacity.
that's
a
word
that
you
can
look
at
anything
in
the
world,
past,
present,
and
future,
but
it
ends
up
with
a
number,
even
if
it's
a
guess,
and
subtract
from
that
existing
wage-earnings,
or
whatever,
and
divide
by
two-thirds,
all
right.
those
are
two
numbers
plus
a
division.
now,
this
is
providing
a
jumping
system,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
says,
how
do
we
make
that
consistent
with
those
words,
wage-earning
capacity,
and
at
that
point,
i
think
maybe
the
sg's
interpretation
is
within
the
envelope,
but
it
should
be
the
secretary
of
labor
to
whom
we
defer
on
such
matters,
that
has
thought
this
thing
through.
now,
you're
familiar
with
the
cases,
and
the
background,
and
the
history.
it
would
sometimes
help
the
worker,
the
one
system,
sometimes
hurt
the
worker.
we
don't
know.
what
is
the
state
of
the
art?
has
this
matter
of
what
we
call
the
jumping
interpretation
of
the
words
wage-earning
capacity
been
thought
through
by
the
labor
department,
they
decide
that's
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
they
advance
it,
in
the
history
of
these
cases?
