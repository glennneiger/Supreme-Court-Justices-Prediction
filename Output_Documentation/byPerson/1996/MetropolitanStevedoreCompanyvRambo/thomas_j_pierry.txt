mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
nearly
2
years
ago
in
rambo
i,
this
court
was
presented
with
the
issue
of
what
conditions
justified
modification
of
a
permanent
disability
award
under
section
922
of
the
act.
rambo
ii
presents
this
court
with
very
different
issues.
despite
petitioner's
attempts
to
focus
this
court's
attentions
on
and
frame
the
issues
around
the
1-year
limitation
in
section
922,
the
primary
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
nominal
awards
are
authorized
by
section
908(h).
this
is
because
the
act
defines
disability
in
terms
of
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity,
and
it
is
section
908(h),
not
section
922,
which
provides
the
methods
to
determine
the
wage-earning
capacity
of
an
injured
worker.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
the
problem
is,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
i
think
the
solicitor
has
also
pointed
out,
there
was
a
failure
to
consider,
at
least
a
failure
to
write
down
in
the
opinion
various
factors
that
have
been
outlined
in
section
908(h)
as
important
to
consider
when
determining
loss
of
earning
capacity
of
an
injured
worker.
i
don't
fault
the
alj
so
much
as
i
fault
the
employer,
and
i
agree
with
the
solicitor--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--well,
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
administrative
law
judges
are
required
to
make
explicit
findings
on
all
relevant
matters,
factors
in
the
determination
that
he's
issuing.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
well--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--i
think
he
has
to
at
least
go
through
most
of
the
factors
and
indicate
that
based
upon
all
of
the
factors
which
have
been
considered
relevant
in
the
determination
of
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity
he
does
not
find
any
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
well,
i
would
think
that
he
should
cover
all
of
them,
because--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--i
did
say
most,
but
i
think
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
really
requires
explicit
determinations
on
all
relevant
factors.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
problem
is,
though,
that
he
didn't
adequately
deal
with
specific
factors
listed
in
908(h),
such
as
the
nature
of
the
injury,
the
degree
of
physical
impairment,
and
whether
or
not
the
claimant
is
capable...
is
performing
his
usual
pre-injury
employment.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
truthfully,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
all
of
them
do,
but
they
should
in
this
situation.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
i
disagree,
your
honor,
just
because
under
the
section
908(h)
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
they
specifically
list
certain
factors;
qualitative
factors,
i
would
admit,
such
as
the
nature
of
the
injury,
the
degree
of
physical
impairment,
and
whether
or
not
the
claimant
is
capable
of
doing
his
usual
pre-injury--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--that
would
be
a
very
difficult
case,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
because
i
believe
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
requires--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--your
honor,
i
wish
i
had
that
before
you
at
my
fingertips
but--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--yes.
i
apologize,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
section,
though,
that
says
that
an
administrative
procedure...
an
administrative
law
judge,
rather,
must
make
explicit
findings
on
all
relevant
factors
in
his
determination.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
your
honor,
i
have
quoted
it
in
my
brief,
and
i
forgot
it.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
well,
i
think
as
to
certain
factors
that
are
very
important
factors,
such
as
the
factors
that
are
set
out
in
908(h),
those
ones
at
least
should
be
dealt
with
in
a
very
substantial
manner
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
well,
your
honor,
the
record
is
unclear
in
that
regard.
i
believe
that
the
main
issue
that
the
administrative
law
judge
felt
that
he
was
faced
with
was
whether
or
not
to
terminate
benefits
based
upon
the
earnings
that
mr.
rambo
was
experiencing,
the
higher
earnings,
so
i
don't
believe
there
really
was
an
explicit
determination
of
that
fact.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
though
that
makes
this
case
different
and
unique
from
all
of
the
other
nominal
award
cases,
different
from
hole
and
lafaille
and
randall,
is
that
all
of
those
cases
arose
out
of
an
initial
claim
hearing,
where
the
claimant
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
coming
forward
and
proving
that
he
has
a
disability.
this
claim
arises
out
of
a
modification
proceeding
where
the
claimant
has
already
established
that
he
has
a
disability,
and--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think
as
the
ninth
circuit
stated
rambo's
contesting
of
termination
of
his
benefits
also
included
his
assertion
that
he's
entitled
to
any
lesser
amount
under--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
your
honor,
i
guess
what
i'd
point
to
is
really
the
language
of
congress
in
terms
of
the
state
of
the
art
in
section
908(h).
when
they
list
the
qualitative
factors,
such
as
consideration
of
the
nature
of
the
injury,
the
degree
of
physical
impairment,
whether
or
not
the
claimant
can
do
his
usual
employment,
those
are
all
things
where
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
you
could
ever
get
to
a
particular
dollar
amount.
and
i
think
that
when
congress
listed
that
we
should
consider
the
effect
of
his
disability
as
it
may
naturally
extend
into
the
future,
they
realized
that
it
may
be
impossible
at
times
to
accurately
give
a
particular
dollar
amount
and
therefore
they
envisioned
nominal
awards.
in
fact,
i
have
quoted
the
1983
and
'84
committee
reports
which
certainly
let
us
know
that
congress
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
these
type
of
nominal
awards
were
being
issued
and
they
did
nothing
to
change
the
system.
and
also,
what
i
think
is
important
about
those
committee
reports
is
that
there
is
a
concern
expressed,
a
main
concern,
i
believe,
that
without
these
type
of
awards
claimants
are
going
to
be
coming
in
and
filing
yearly
requests
for
modification
because
they
aren't
allowed
to
get
a
nominal
modified
award,
and
that
would
present
an
administrative
nightmare,
and
i
think
that's
why
congress...
that's
at
least
a
good
explanation
of
why
congress
didn't
change
the
system.
your
honor,
to
follow
up
on
your
question,
if
there
is
no
provision
for
nominal
awards,
there
is
what
the
circuit
courts
have
termed
an
onerous
burden
on
the
administrative
law
judge
to
try
to
determine
what
exactly
the
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity
is
in
a
case
where
there
is
serious
medical
disability.
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated
in
the
randall
case,
the
act
requires
omniscience
of
the
judge.
he
has
to
determine
whether
the
claimant
will
suffer
any
work-related
reduction
in
his
earning
capacity
at
any
time
in
his
lifetime.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
the
difference
is
section
922,
though.
there's
a
provision
specifically
allowed
in
this
act
for
modification
of
awards
to
account
for
a
wage-earning
capacity
going
up
or
down
over
the
years.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that
is
true,
your
honor.
however,
this
involves
workers
who...
and
the
primary
issue
to
be
determined
is
what
is
their
wage-earning
capacity,
whereas
in
a
divorce
case
that
is
not
the
primary
issue.
we
are
trying
to
determine
what
an
injured
worker--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--that's
true,
your
honor.
however,
again,
in
this
law
there's
a
specific
provision
made
for
modification
because
congress
realized
that
an
injured
worker's
earnings
may
fluctuate
as
the
time
goes
on.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
you
may
be
correct
about
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
yes,
i
think,
your
honor,
you're
right.
they've
always
quoted
in
the
eighties
opinions
that
the
solicitor
referred
to
that
it
was
a
judicial
infringement
on
the
time
limitation.
my
point
is,
the
main
point,
i
think,
of
the
petitioner...
of
the
respondent,
rather,
is
that
section
922's
time
limitation
does
not
even
enter
into
the
fray
when
we're
talking
about
what
type
of
remedy
is
allowed
to
be
fashioned.
rather,
section
908(h)
is
the
section
which
specifically
directs
how
earning
capacity
of
an
injured
worker
is
calculated,
and
therefore
the
section
922
1-year
limitation
on
modifications
should
not
be
seen
as
a
device
that
prevents
entering
any
type
of
award.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that's
exactly
right.
in
fact,
as
the
1983
and
'84
legislative
history
makes
clear,
the
committee
suggested
limiting
both
the
forward-looking
language
of
section
908(h)
and
the
1-year
time
limitation
and
modification.
that
would
make
nominal
awards
unnecessary
and
also
would
reduce
the
specter
of
this
administrative
nightmare
of
yearly
requests
of
filing
requests
for
modification
by
workers.
however,
congress
chose
not
to
do
that,
and
the
petit...
the
respondent's
point,
rather,
is
that
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
get
this
court
to
do
what
congress
chose
not
to
do,
which
is
to
change
the
act
and
disallow
nominal
awards.
congress
was
aware
of
these
nominal
awards
and
chose
not
to
change
the
act
to
forbid
them.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
that
gets
to
the
question
of
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
in
this
particular
case
i
do
defend
it,
and
if
i
may
explain,
i
think
the
question
of
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
what
that
burden
of
proof
is
depends
on
at
what
stage
of
the
proceedings
the
question
is
raised.
at
the
initial
claim,
respondent
would
agree
with
the
solicitor
that
it's
the
claimant
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
he
has
to
prove
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
at
some
point
in
the
future
he
will
suffer
a
reduction
in
earnings.
if
he
does
that,
then
he's
established
a
disability.
rambo
did
that
in
this
case.
he
established
that
he
had
a
disability,
and
he
was
not
only
awarded
a
disability--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--i
believe
that
it's
the
same
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
that
the
employer
has
to
prove--
you're
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
yes.
i
support
it
because
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
saying
is
there
was
a
significant
possibility
that
the
claimant
would
suffer
a
loss
of
earnings
in
the
future,
therefore
the
employer
had
not
met
its
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
your
honor,
i
believe
that
what
the
alj...
the
ninth
circuit
said
about
the
alj's
decision
was
that
the
alj's
decision
did
not
take
into
account
certain
specified
factors,
and
therefore
that
his
decision
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
considered
as
a
whole,
and
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit,
when
faced
with
the
evidence
that
was
presented,
which
really
was
only
the
increase
in
earnings,
they
decided
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
but
as
far
as
the
evidence
the
employer
presented
in
terms
of
supporting
termination,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
there
was
not
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
alj's
finding
that
the
employer
had
basically--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--your
right,
your
honor,
and
that
was
because
he
was
relying
on
years
of
precedent
regarding--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
no,
your
honor.
what
the
respondent's
position
is,
that
since
the
employer
was
the
one
that
had
the
burden
of
proof
at
the
modification
proceeding,
and
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
alj's
decision
that
they
sustained
that
burden
of
proof
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
that
therefore
the
case
should
be
affirmed,
and
that
if
the
employer
then
wishes
to
go
ahead
and
seek
another
modification
hearing,
it
can
then--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--right.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
your
honor,
yes.
the
alj
didn't
specify
the
certain
factors
that
i
talked
about
in
908(h).
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
well,
that's
the
problem,
your
honor.
in
this
proceeding
the
employer
didn't
present
evidence
which
it
should
have
in
order
to
sustain
its
burden
of
terminating
benefits.
it's
respondent's
position
that
if
they
wanted
to,
the
employer
should
have
come
in
with
rehabilitative
experts
saying
that
there's
no
chance
that...
or
very
little
chance
that
rambo
will
lose
his
crane
job,
or
that
there
are
many
other
jobs
out
there
that
he
can
do,
or,
alternatively,
they
also
could
have
come
in
with
medical
evidence
saying,
his
condition
has
improved.
there's
many
other
jobs
he
can
do
besides
crane
operator.
they
chose
to
bring
in
none
of
that
evidence,
and
simply
rely
on
the
increased
earnings.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
petitioner
quotes
the
potomac
river...
or
potomac
power
case
for
the
proposition
that
the
longshore
act
does
not
guarantee
a
completely
adequate
remedy
for
all
covered
disabilities
because
it's
a
compromise
of
competing
interests
and
represents
a
legislative
choice.
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
it
fails
to
address
the
fact
that
in
section
908(h)
the
specific
legislative
choice
has
been
made.
there
is
particular
broad,
forward-looking
language
in
section
908(h)
which
represents
the
legislative
choice
in
this
area.
the
legislative
choice
is
reflected
in
the
philosophy
of
the
courts
in
hole,
lafaille,
and
randall
when
they
adopt
this
nominal
award
so
that
it
can
be
altered
and
amended
as
time
proves
it
to
be
wrong
or
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
guess
what
i...
the
respondent's
point
is,
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
prevents
issuance
of
nominal
awards,
and
since
congress
chose
not
to
prevent
them,
neither
should
this
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that's
true,
your
honor.
it
is
a
difficult
situation
for
the
employee,
the
injured
worker.
as
i
said,
without
nominal
awards,
the
only
alternative
for
the
employee
is
to
come
in
every
year
and
request
for
modification
simply
to
keep
the
statute
of
limitations
from
running
whether
or
not
there's
actually
grounds
for
it,
and
that's
a
difficult
situation,
i
don't
think
one
that
the
courts
would
want
to
endorse,
because
it
creates,
like
i
said
before,
an
administrative
nightmare
of
all
these
requests
for
modification,
perhaps
groundless,
perhaps
some
of
them
have
grounds,
simply
filed
just
to
keep
the
statute
of
limitations
from
running.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that's
true,
but
it
would
definitely
impede
judicial
efficiency
and
economy
because
of
all
these
requests
that
would
be
coming
in
from
claimants
that
had
been
denied.
your
honor,
petitioner's
statement
that
the
longshore
act
does
not
guarantee
a
completely
adequate
remedy
sounds
reasonable,
or
may
sound
reasonable
and
applicable
on
first
reading,
but
further
examination
shows
that
it's
really
inapplicable
in
this
context
of
nominal
awards.
that's
because
disability
under
the
act
is
defined
in
terms
of
wage-earning
capacity.
as
the
randall
court
stated,
under
the
act,
any
reduction
in
wage-earning
capacity
greater
than
zero
is
compensable.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
there's
no
question--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--i
would
like
that
to
be
the
case,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case
under
the
law.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
i
don't
think
there
always
is.
however,
what
i
would
point
to
in
this
record
is
that
the
nature
of
the
injury
and
the
degree
of
physical
impairment
everyone
concedes
have
remained
the
same
as
when
rambo
was
first
awarded
the
disability
award
of
22-1/2
percent.
in
addition,
there
is
testimony,
as
was
pointed
out,
that
he
didn't
know
how
long
this
higher-paying
crane
job
would
last,
and--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--yes,
your
honors.
i
do
agree
with
the
solicitor
in
that
sense.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
at
the
initial
claim
proceeding
i
believe
that
the
claimant
has
the
burden
of
proof,
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
that
he
will
more
likely
than
not
suffer
some
type
of
loss
of
earning
capacity
in
the
future.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
our
position
is
that
since
the
usual
employment
is
a
specific
factor
that's
listed
in
section
908(h),
that
really
is
the
key
determination,
whether
or
not
his
injury
affects
or
impairs
his
ability
to
perform
his
usual
employment,
his
usual
pre-injury
employment,
and
here
there's
no
argument
that
it
did.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
in
this
case
the
usual
employment
is
a
broad
category
term,
and
he
was
a
longshoreman
before
this
accident.
he's
still
a
longshoreman.
he
happens
to
be
doing
lighter
duty
crane
job
work,
but
the
great
majority
of
longshore
work
does
require
a
lot
of
physical
labor,
and
there's
no
question
that
his
disability
impairs
his
ability
to
do
the
great
majority
of
longshore
jobs
that
do
require
physical
labor.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
i
guess...
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
evidence,
but
i
would
concede--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--there's
a
wide
variety
of
jobs.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
but
what
i
would
say
in
that
regard
is
that
i
can
envision
circumstances
where
a
claimant
has
so
completely
changed
industries,
become
an
accountant
or
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer,
that
in
no
way
would
ever
require
physical
labor,
and
he
has
also
come
forward,
or
someone
has
come
forward
with
evidence
indicating
that
there
is
very
little
chance
that
he
will
lose
that
type
of
job,
that
complete
termination
could
be
justified.
i
just
don't
think
it
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
your
honors,
the
mechanism
of
nominal
awards
fulfills
the
forward-looking
perspective
of
908(h)
and
it
lifts
the
onerous
burden
from
the
alj.
it
lifts
the
burden
inherent
in
any
attempt
to
pick
a
disability
figure
out
of
thin
air,
as
the
circuit
courts
have
stated,
rather
than
simply
assigning
a
nominal
value
and
allowing
it
to
be
changed
at
a
later
date.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
that's
an
interesting
question--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--and
i
can't
give
you
an
answer
to
that.
all
i
know
is
they're--
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
--i
think
employers
generally
don't
like
to
have
nominal
awards
because
they
have
to
keep
their
cases
open,
and
they
have
to
keep
looking
at
cases,
rather
than
closing
them.
mr.
thomas
j.
pierry,
iii
thank
you
very
much.
