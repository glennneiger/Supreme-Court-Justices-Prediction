justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
if
there
is
a
loss
of
earning
capacity
and
you
insist
that
it
be
a
present
one...
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
not.
so
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
of
what
you're
saying.
you
want
to
explain
it
to
me
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
solicitor
general
was
saying
that
if
there
is
a
determination
that
there
will
in
the
future
be
a
loss
of
earning
capacity,
although
there
is
none
now,
nominal
damages
can
be
awarded.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
can
never
be
nominal
damages.
there
can
never
be
nominal
damages,
is
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
you
weren't
saying
categorically
there
could
never
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
your
case
that
he
did
not
have
a
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
wait.
if
he
can't
do
heavy
lifting
any
more
but
he
can
operate
a
crane,
do
you
concede
that
he
therefore
has
a
disability?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
that's...
i
thought
you
just
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
babcock--
--mr.
babcock,
i
thought
your
position
was
that
there's
no
disability
unless
there's
a
reduction
of
earning
capacity,
and
that
if
you're
speculating
that
there
may
be
a
reduction
of
earning
capacity,
all
you've
established
is
that
there
may
be
a
disability,
and
the
act
does
not
allow
the
award
of
any
damages
if
there
may
be
a
disability,
does
it?
doesn't
it
require
a
probability,
at
least--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
reasonable
award
within
the
meaning
of
908(h)?
i
would
think
that
a
reasonable
one
means
you
calculate
what
the
reduction
of
earning
is
as
best
you
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
dollar
is
not
as
best
you
can.
you're
just
saying
i
can't
calculate
what
it
is,
so
i'm
just
picking
a
number
out
of
the
air.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
couldn't
adopt
one
position
in
some
cases
and
another
position
in
other
cases.
i
mean,
just
the
fact
that
it
announced
its
acquiescence
in
a
case
from
the
first
circuit
doesn't
mean
it
wasn't
pushed
there
by
the
fact
that
it
was
getting
all
these
contrary
decisions
from
other
circuits.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
on
the
other
question,
even
though
you
argue
that
there
can
be
nominal
damages
you
say
in
this
case
there's
no
basis
for
it
and
the
alj
simply
found
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
nominal
damages
were
not
appropriate.
that
is
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
apparently
not
the
petitioner's
position.
as
i
understood
his
oral
argument,
he
concedes
that
if
we
disagree
with
him
on
nominal
damages
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
alj.
you
don't
think
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
hasn't
the
alj
found
here
that
it
is
not
likely?
i
mean,
the
alj
says,
this
demonstrates
that
claimant's
average
weekly
wages
more
than
tripled
from
1980
to
'90.
after
taking
into
consideration
the
increasing
wages
due
to
rate
of
inflation,
blah,
blah,
it
is
evident
that
claimant
no
longer
has
a
wage-earning
capacity
loss.
although
he
testified
that
he
might
lose
his
job
at
some
future
time,
the
evidence
shows
that
claimant
would
not
be
at
any
greater
risk
of
losing
his
job
than
anyone
else.
and
it
goes
on
like
that.
i...
as
i
read
this
alj
determination,
it's
a
finding
that
there
is
no
probability
of
future
reduction.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whose
burden
is
that
to
establish?
i
mean,
he
has
to
negate
every...
the
alj's
order
has
to
negate
every
possible
fact
that
it's
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
establish?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pierry,
did
the
alj
decline
to
make
an
award
in
this
case,
nominal
or
otherwise,
because
he
felt
he
had
no
authority
to
make
nominal
awards?
is
that
what
he
thought?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
read
his
opinion
as
believing
he
had
the
authority,
but
simply
finding
on
these
facts
no
nominal
award
was
justified.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
this
enough
to
show
that
he
hasn't
lost
any
earning
capacity?
no
evidence
has
been
offered
to
show
that
claimant's
age,
education,
and
vocational
training
are
such
that
he
would
be
at
a
greater
risk
of
losing
his
present
job,
or
in
seeking
new
employment
in
the
event
that
he
should
be
required
to
do
so.
he's
saying
he's
going
to
be
just
like
every
other
crane
operator
in
seeking
new
employment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
alj
orders
normally
do
that,
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
any
of
them
do
it.
this
seems
to
me
a
fully
adequate
finding.
i
wouldn't...
yes,
they
have
to
make
findings
of
fact,
but
i
don't
know
why
on
the
facts
set
forth
here
there's
any
basis
for
saying
there's
been
a
loss
in
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
any
different
from
what
happens
in
a
normal
civil
trial,
which
i
assume
is
the
model.
you
point
out
that
this
is
a
section...
i
assume
it's
a
section
556
proceeding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
the
administrative
procedure
act
that's
required
to
be
conducted
on
the
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
a
regular
full
dress
civil
trial
is
the
model
for
that,
and
it
happens
all
the
time.
you
take
your
best
guess
as
to
what
the
damages
will
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
are
some
civil
actions
that
allow
modifications,
too.
divorce
decrees
can
be
modified,
but
i
don't
know
that
a
judge
in
a
divorce
case
would
be...
would
feel
that
he's
entitled
not
to
even
take
his
best
shot
at
figuring
out
what
the
actual
amounts
ought
to
be.
just
say,
you
know,
i'll
give
you
a
dollar
for
now,
and
come
back
5
years
from
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
propose
is
so
sensible.
it
works
so
well.
i
can't
figure
out
why
the
benefits
review
board
would
have
been
opposed
to
it
except
that
it
thought
the
statute
didn't
allow
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now,
is
it
a
substantial
evidence...
i
thought
earlier
your
objection
to
the
alj's
decree
was
not
a
substantial
evidence
one,
but
that
he
hadn't
made
the
necessary
findings.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
the
provision
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
you
referred
to,
by
the
way,
simply
requires
that
the
record
include
a
statement
of
finding
and
conclusions
and
the
reasons
or
basis
therefore
on
all
the
material
issues
of
fact,
law,
or
discretion
presented
on
the
record.
now,
what
had
been
presented
on
the
record
here
that
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
a
substantial
evidence
objection
you're
making,
not
a
findings
objection,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
proceeding
to
alter
the
original
award.
i
think
justice
ginsburg's
question
goes
to
the
original
award.
what
is
your
position
as
to
whether
an
original
nominal
award
can
be
made?
what
do
you
need
to
show,
a
probability
that
your
wages
will
be
lowered
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
he
had
gotten
another
job
as
an
accountant,
let's
say,
he
got
retrained
as
an
accountant,
that
wouldn't
at
all
affect
his
entitlement
to
awards.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
he
was
an
accountant
for...
i
guess
the
longshore
companies
have
accountants,
don't
they?
[laughter]
what
don't
longshore
companies
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
must
be
something
they
don't
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
out
of
curiosity,
do...
is
it
your
perception
that
employers
generally
like
it
this
way,
or
generally
would
rather
have
the
alj
guess
as
to
what
the
future
will
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
doesn't
split
out
necessarily
on
the
basis
of
plaintiffs'
versus
defendants'
preference.
