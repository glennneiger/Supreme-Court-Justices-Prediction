mr.
robert
e.
babcock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
has
awarded
john
rambo
compensation
not
because
he
has
a
disability,
but
because
the
panel
perceived
a
possibility
that
disability
would
some
day
occur.
it
has
awarded
compensation
to
a
worker
not
first
determined
to
have
a
loss
of
earning
capacity.
the
panel
took
this
action
to
prevent
the
running
of
a
time
limit
on
modification.
it
did
so
despite
this
court's
clear
direction
in
the
previous
opinion
involving
the
same
claim
that
a
claimant
is
not
disabled
unless
and
until
he
proves
an
incapacity
to
earn
wages.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
to
ever
make
a
nominal
award?
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
yes,
i
do.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
the
solicitor
takes
the
position
that
if
a
disability
is
shown,
i.e.,
if
an
individual
is
proven
to
have
in
all
probability
a
loss
of
earning
capacity,
then
such
an
individual
could,
in
the
solicitor's
opinion,
properly
receive
a
nominal
award.
the
ninth
circuit
went
further
than
did
the
solicitor
and
said
that
if
it's
possible
that
there
will
be
a
loss
of
earning
capacity,
hence
the
solicitor's
request
for
remand--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--no,
i
do
not.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
current
determination
that
there
is
a
loss
of
earning
capacity.
the
process
of
determining
may
certainly
look
forward
into
the
future.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
because
they
want
to
substitute...
the
ninth
circuit
speculates...
substitutes
doubt
and
speculation
for
the
basic
question
of
whether
there
is
a
disability.
if
there
might
be,
they'd
say
that
there
could
be
a
nominal
award.
the
solicitor
says,
not
quite
that
far,
but
instead
let's
substitute
this
doubt
for
something
else,
and
that's
the
other
element
that's
necessary
to
prove
a
compensation
award.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i'll
try.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
yes,
the
solicitor
says
that.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
yes,
because
there's
another
element
required
to
receive
compensation.
a
disability,
an
unspecified,
unmeasured
proof
of
a
loss,
the
loss
has
to
be
measured,
and
what
the...
the
process
would
be
a
claimant
would
prove
in
a
normal
claim
proceeding
i
have
a
disability
and
here
is
evidence
that
will
allow
you,
administrative
law
judge,
to
determine
the
degree,
because
without
the
degree
you
can't
determine
the
compensation.
the
numerator
is
the
wage,
the
denominator
is
the
earning
capacity
that
exists
post
injury.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
no.
i
would
say
that
you
may
find
a
disability
but
you
have
to
have
more
to
give
the
award
of
compensation.
you
have
to
have
evidence
that
would
allow
the
administrative
law
judge
to
fix
a
figure
as
section
8(h)
requires,
fix
a
figure.
the
solicitor--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--well,
in
that--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--it
would
depend
upon
the
evidence
presented.
the
classic
case
that
we
deal
with
with
some
frequency
is,
an
individual
is
earning
more.
the
individual
comes
in
and
says,
but
i
don't
think
i'll
keep
up
this
pace
for
long.
he
brings
in
a
doctor.
the
doctor
says,
i
don't
think
he'll
keep
up
the
pace.
now
he's
proved
a
disability.
next
step,
though,
in
order
to
get
an
award
of
compensation,
how
much
is
he
losing,
and
the
doctor
in
a
very
simple
example
might
say,
i
don't
think
he'll
be
able
to
work
for
more
than
4
days
weekly.
now
the
administrative
law
judge
has
a
basis
for
making
a
figure,
for
fixing
a
figure,
but
until
he
has
that
basis
in
the
evidence,
he
can't--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--i
think
the
administrative
law
judge
would
need
more
to
fix
a
figure.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
how
long
the
individual
is
going
to
live...
excuse
me,
going
to
work,
what
he
can
go
to
after
that
time--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--the
doctor
says
he
can
only
stay
in
longshoring
for
5
years.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
he
puts
on
proof
saying
after
that
he
can
be
a
security
guard.
with
those
two
pieces
of
evidence,
the
earnings
available
in
longshoring
for
the
remaining
5
years
and
the
earnings
available
as
a
security
guard,
the
administrative
law
judge
has
a
basis
for
making
a
figure.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
that
is
my
position,
because--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--nominal
damages
are
a
substitute
for
a
real
award.
it's
an
ersatz
version
for
a
real
award.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
it
may
be
consistent
with
what
is
right,
with
what
is
just
and
what
is
fair,
but
it
is
not
consistent--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--with
the
1-year
time
limitation.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
well,
the
act
doesn't
define
disability
as
a
possible
future
loss
of
earning
capacity.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
it
defines
it
as
a
loss
of
earning
capacity.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
no,
i
think
it's
not
consistent
with
the
act,
because
i
think
it
ignores
the
limitation
of
section
22.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
not
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
but
we
deal
with
these
cyclical
types
of
industries
all
the
time
in
the
shipyards,
and
you
make
an
assessment
of
how
long
he's
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
work,
the
judge
gets
additional
evidence
of
what
other
types
of
work
there
are
available
on
the
open
labor
market,
and
from
that
evidence,
not
from
a
substitution
of
speculation
or
possibilities,
from
that
evidence
he
determines
what
that
earning
capacity
is.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
no,
sir.
i
think
the
difference
is
one
of
whether
you're
substituting
something,
a
possibility
or
a
predictive
degree
for
evidence,
and
this
is
a
system
that
is
built
on--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--and
now
he
has,
presumably
with
those
facts,
a
disability.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
the
question
still
remains,
what
is
his
numerical
earning
capacity?
what
is,
in
dollars
and
cents--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--one
can
look
for--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--no,
my...
i...
everybody--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--no.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
no.
if
i
did,
i
sure--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--it's
possible
on
some
facts
to
find
that,
but
the
administrative
law
judge
reached
the
contrary
conclusion.
the
administrative
law
judge
found
his
wage-earning
capacity
loss
had
ended,
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
his
current
earnings
are
representative
of
his
future
capacity
to
earn.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
that
theoretically
is
possible,
but
i
think
inappropriate,
because--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--if
you
determine
that
a
mere
possibility
of
future
economic
harm
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
nominal
award,
and
you
conclude
that
a
nominal
award
is--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--yes.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
if
you--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--i
think
you
have
to
send
it
back
to
get
a
determination
of
the
factual
issues--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--as
identified
by
the
solicitor
in
the
brief,
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a...
on
a
more-probable-than-not
basis
a
likelihood
of
that
harm.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
well,
that's
why
the
nominal
award
concept
is
both
a
shield
and
a
sword--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--for
both
claimants
and
employers.
in
the
purest
view
of
the
longshore
system
he
would
have
to
do
what
they
do
now,
which
is
make
that
assessment
and
give
an
award
which
overcompensates
during
the
period
that
he
continues--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--i
think
that's
the
structure
of
this
system,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
it
is
inconsistent
with
section
22
and
its
1-year
time
limitation.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
because...
and
with
the
definition
of
disability,
which
is
an
incapacity
to
earn
wages.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
that's
the
definition.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
the
difficulty
is
that
you
are
substituting
concerns
about
the
future
for
the
requirement
of
evidence
if
you
give
a
nominal
award.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
there
is...
within
8(h)
it
is
a
two-step
process
of
how
you
determine
earning
capacity.
if
you
argue
as
an
individual
that
the
earnings
are
not
representative
of
your
earning
capacity,
you
must
prove
that
fact
by
a
preponderance
of
substantial
evidence.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
the
practice
that
prevents
that
is
in
this
8(h)
two-step
process
to
determine
an
entitlement.
first,
you
must
prove,
if
you're
the
one
alleging
that
wages
are
not
representative,
higher
earnings
are
not
representative,
you
must
prove
that
they
are
not
representative,
that
something
may
happen
in
the
future.
second...
or
something
is
probable
to
happen
in
the
future.
second,
you
must
prove
an
alternative
figure.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
no.
as
i'm
sure
we're
all
aware
now,
every
circuit
that
has
considered
the
nominal
award
concept
has
in
varying
degrees,
ranging
from
that
proffered
by
the
solicitor
to
the
extreme
version
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit,
approved
the
concept
as
a
reasonable
means
of
assuring
protections
against
possible
harm
greater
than
congress
built
into--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--the
benefits
review
board
has
historically
rejected
the
concept
as
an
impermissible
intrusion
upon
the
1-year
limitation.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
nothing
in
22
prevents
that,
because
the
effect
of
a
real
award
is
to
achieve
that.
the
problem
with
the
nominal
award
is
that
it
is
not
real.
it
is
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
nothing
in
22
prevents
a
nominal
award,
other
than
it
sets
the
standard
for
the
period
of
time
congress
thought
protection
against
possible
harm
appropriate.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
no
question,
a
nominal
award
gives
greater
protection
against
the
future
than
congress
provides
in
section
22.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
i
think
not
under
that
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
there
has
to
be
a
determined
loss
of
earning
capacity,
which
is
in
itself
forward-looking,
so
he's
not
losing
now,
but
the
administrative
law
judge
determines
that
over
time
he
will
lose.
that
is,
by
definition,
the
lost--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--that
would
kick
in
on
the
date
of
the
decision,
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
that
would
be
overcompensation
under
this
system
during
the
first
3
years
and
undercompensation
thereafter.
i
would
point
out,
though,
that
would
be
a
real
award
that
would
be
subject
to
modification
as
time
went
on.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
a
real
award
does--
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
--i
don't
quarrel
with,
in
some
instances,
the
wisdom
of
a
nominal
award.
what
i
do
say
is,
it's
not...
determination
about
that
wisdom
is
not
something
that
should
be
for
the
judiciary.
it's
something
that
properly
belongs
to
congress,
and
congress
hasn't
entered
into
the
act
a
nominal
award.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
the...
my
position
on
that
would
obviously
be
that
we
think
there
need
be
a
substantial
probability,
and
on
that
point
we
would
support
the
solicitor's
position.
if
you
look
among
the
circuits,
in
the
hole
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
the
administrative
law
judge
had
determined
there
to
be
a
disability,
i.e.,
that
the
current
earnings
were
not
representative
of
the
earning
capacity,
and
then
was
faced
with
the
choice,
do
i
pick
a
big
speculative
award,
or
do
i
pick
a
small
speculative
award.
he
picked
a
small,
nominal
alternative,
and
the
fifth
circuit
approved
it.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
that's
correct.
he
would
have
evidence
supportive
of
it.
mr.
robert
e.
babcock
thank
you.
