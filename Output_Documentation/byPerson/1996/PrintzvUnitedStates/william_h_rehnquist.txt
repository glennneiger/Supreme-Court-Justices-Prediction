we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-1478,
jay
printz,
the
sheriff
of
ravalli
county,
montana...
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
ravalli?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
united
states
v.
richard
mack,
the
sheriff
of
graham
county,
arizona.
mr.
halbrook.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
be
rather
strange
to
have
one-and-a-half
on
patrol,
wouldn't
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--now,
did--
--how
about
some
of
the
early
cases
that
seem
to
involve
immigration
and
required
court
clerks
to
keep
some
sort
of
a
record
or
take
some
sort
of
an
affidavit,
a
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
follow
up
on
an
earlier
answer
you
gave,
mr.
halbrook.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
even
if
the
federal
government
were
to
send
out
people
to
look
at
state
records,
that
that
would
not
be
permissible,
and
i
think
that's
a
rather
strange
answer,
if
i
understood
it
correctly.
certainly,
in...
say,
in
voting
rights
cases,
federal,
fbi
people
come
and
look
at
state
voter
registrations.
if
no
activity
were
required
on
the
part
of
a
state
agent,
just
the
federal
government
would
send
an
agent
to
look
at
some,
say,
criminal
history
records,
would
that
be
violative
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
you
have
the
commerce
clause,
which
certainly
gives
general
authority
over
things
that
move
in
commerce,
and
there's
no
challenge
here
on
that
ground.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
halbrook.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
dellinger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
also
you
would
say
there
was
some
difference
between
wartime
and
peacetime
as
to
congressional
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
board
of
supervisors
from
one
of
these
counties
says,
you
know,
you're
doing
a
lot
of
stuff
for
us
already,
and
go
ahead
and
do
the
brady
act
stuff,
but
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
list,
and
then
as...
it
turns
out,
in
fact,
that
they
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
and
they
never
get
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
the
way
they
exercise
their
discretion--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
they
obey
the
board
of
supervisors
and
put
the
brady
act
stuff
last.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
don't
ordinarily
decide
constitutional
questions...
i
mean,
are
we
going
to
say
to
someone
who
raises
a
first
amendment
claim,
gee,
plenty
of
other
people
have
obeyed
this
law,
and
here
you
are
complaining
about
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
dellinger.
the
case
is
submitted.
