mr.
halbrook,
the
government
in
its
brief
on
page
31
has
a
footnote
21
citing
several
laws.
do
all
of
those,
as
far
as
you
know,
fit
within
the
kind
of,
we
give
you
this
and
in
return
you
give
us
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my
question
is,
are
you
saying
that
there's
nothing
like
this,
that
in
every
case
there's
either
something
explicit
in
the
constitution,
like
the
obligation
of
state
courts
that
you
get
from
article
vi,
or
extradition?
is
this
the
first
of
a
kind,
or
is
there
anything
that
you
would
concede
is
like
it?

may
i
ask
you--
justice

ginsburg
--before
you
finish
if
you
could
just
address
the
severability
question,
because
you
said
something
before
about,
if
you...
if
it
was
voluntary
it
wouldn't
work,
because
everybody
would
buy
their
guns
in
a
place
that
doesn't
participate.
