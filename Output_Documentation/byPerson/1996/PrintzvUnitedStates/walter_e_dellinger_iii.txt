mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
halbrook's
answers
at
oral
argument
are,
i
believe,
fully
consistent
with
the
position
that
they
have
taken
in
their
brief,
and
i
think
for
understandable
reasons.
they
believe
that
there's
an
entire
failure
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
to
enact
a
law
of
this
kind
just
as
if
it
were
the
government
of
brazil
or
the
king
of
belgium.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no,
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because
of
the
supremacy
clause,
i
think,
justice
kennedy.
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
supremacy
clause
resolved
that
issue,
justice
kennedy,
where
congress
is
acting
as
it
is
here,
fully
within
the
core
of
one
of
its
enumerated
powers.
the
three
critical
points,
i
think,
are
first
that...
just
to
tell
you
what
i
think
i
would
hope
to
discuss...
are
first
that,
because
this
law
does
not
impermissibly
require
the
states
to
govern
but,
rather,
essentially
applies
federal
law
to
local
law
enforcement
officers
and
to
gun
dealers,
requiring
them
to
exchange
vital
information,
and
because
brady
uses
local
law
enforcement
as
the
source
of
this
information
for
the
very
good
reason
that
these
offices
have,
for
now,
the
most
ready
access
to
the
relevant
information,
and
finally,
because
the
interim
brady
provisions
are
by
definition
so
reasonable
in
their
approach
that
it
is
necessary
to
resort
to
resurrecting
a
rigid
rule
like
the
repudiated
position
of
kentucky
v.
dennison--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--congress
may
not
be
saddled
with
a
duty
of
executive
branch
government.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
i...
it
is
not
the
case
that
congress
is
ignoring
the
principles
of
federalism,
your
honor.
i
think
the
act
is
quite
sensitive
to
those
concerns.
i
would
not
necessarily
concede
that
congress
could
not
seek
information
that
was
in
the
hands
of
congressional
offices
and
require
them
to
transmit
it.
if
congress
can
require
congressional
offices
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
i
understand
that.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
i
understand
that,
justice
kennedy,
and
it's
a
fair
one,
but
it
is
important
to
realize
the
extent
to
which
this
is
a
law
that
applies
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
congress
can
impose
upon
state
and
local
government
officials
the
responsibility
for
assisting
in
the
execution
of
a
federal
program
as
long
as,
first,
it
does
not
implicate
the
serious
concerns
of
state
sovereignty
and
political
accountability
that
are
identified
in
new
york--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
understand
that.
my
answer
is
a
predictive
one,
that
it
would
quite
likely
be
the
case
that
such
a
program
would,
in
fact,
run
afoul
of
the
principles
of
sovereignty
and
accountability
because
it
would
place
the
states
in
a
position
of
making
policy
according
to
a
federal
mandate.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--my
answer
is
that
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--my
answer
is
that
such
a
statute
would
not,
as
you
define
it,
violate
the
principles
of
sovereignty
and
accountability
set
out--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--now...
yes,
exactly.
now,
i
do
not--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because,
for
the
reasons
this
court
sets
forth
in
new
york
v.
united
states.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
what
congress--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--what
congress
has
done
here
is,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
not
a
smaller
version
of
that
large
program,
because
they
have
been
careful
to
take
responsibility
for
the
policy
choices
and
then
for
the
administrative
policy
choices.
this
act
is
administered
by
the
departments
of
justice
and
treasury,
by
the
atf,
the
fbi,
by
assistant
u.s.
attorneys,
by
the
bureau
of--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
what
congress
cannot
do.
first
of
all,
in
answer
to
your
question
and
justice
scalia's
about
the
extent
of
the
burden,
there
is
some
limit,
as
this
court
suggested
in
garcia,
to
how
much
of
a
purely
financial
burden
congress
could
put
on
the
states
if
congress
made
all
the
policy
choices
itself.
that...
and
answering
those
hypothetically
is
difficult,
because
it
would
depend
on
the
degree
of
the
national
interest.
in
1917,
congress
had
every
state
government
devote
its
entire
resources
for
a
brief
period
of
time
to
registering
people
for
the
world
war
i
draft.
you
would
want
to
know
the
degree
of
flexibility
and
discretion
that
were
permitted
to
the
states
to
carry
out
their
own
functions.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
depend
upon
that
and
all
the
other
circumstances
as
to
how
great
a
burden
congress
could
put.
but
i
want
to
be
clear
that
we
believe
that,
under
the
vital
principles
of
new
york
v.
united
states,
there
are
provisions
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
that
are
different
from
the
provision
here.
for
example,
even
if
it
only
cost
the
state
$5
and
their
officials
5
minutes
of
their
time,
the
constitution
would
be
violated
if
congress
had
decided
to
off-load
some
of
the
political
responsibility
here
by
requiring
each
city
council
and
county
commission
to
vote
in
the
provisions
of
the
brady
act.
even
though
that's
fairly
costless,
requiring
them
to
act
like
puppets
and
to
call
the
roll
saying,
all
those
in
favor
raise
your
hand,
and
they're
required
to
raise
their
hand
when
they're
not
in
favor,
or
have
some
other
draconian
alternative,
such
as
taking
title
to
handgun
liability.
that
would
violate
the
sovereignty
principles.
similarly,
if
congress
had
said
that
the
states
must,
by
the
year
2010,
reduce
the
number
of
handgun
sales
in
the
state
by
50
percent,
it
would
be
worse
than
simply
having
congress
take
the
political
responsibility
for
the
choices
congress
made,
because
the
states
would
then
be
forced
to
undertake
what
might
be
politically
unpopular
choices
to
solve
a
problem--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
under
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
don't
believe
there
is
any
principle.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
breyer,
those
are
often
unfunded
within
the
context
of
some
other
provision
where
the
courts...
where
the
states
ostensibly
have
a
choice.
i
mean,
i
do
believe
they--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
those
are
not
constitutionally
impermissible,
but
if
congress
were
to
pass
the
perfectly
clean
air
act
of
1998
and
say
to
the
states,
you've
got
to
have
99-44/100
percent
pure
air
by
the
year
2000,
congress
gets
all
the
credit,
and
the
states
are
then
forced
to
choose
between
adopting
mandatory
car-pooling,
or
exorbitant
gasoline
taxes.
that's
not
what
happens
here
when
congress
takes
the
political
responsibility,
and
i
believe
that
once
you're
in
this
area,
although
we
believe
and
have
as
our
most
difficult
question
thinking
about
what
the
outer
limit
would
be
if
congress
were,
contrary
to
200
years
of
its
history,
to
start
imposing
burdens
so
substantial,
even
though
they
did
not
implicate
sovereignty
and
accountability,
that
the
states
would
be
impaired
in
carrying
out
their
functions.
i
think
the
more
serious
question
is
the
one
that
i
think
that
mr.
halbrook
dealt
with
as
well
as
he
can,
which
is,
what
is
the
principle
that
tells
congress,
that
has
extraordinary
legislative
power
to
regulate
these
mobile
items
called
handguns,
that
they
simply
may
not
impose
these
duties
on
gun
dealers
and
local
law
enforcement
officers
who
are
sitting
there
on
the
information,
if
they'll
look
it
up,
to
tell
congress
when
guns
are
being
sold
to
violent
felons
and
other
dangerous
buyers.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well--
[laughter]
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
as
justice
stevens--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
this...
it
would
be,
justice
scalia,
in
the
sense
of
new
york
v.
united
states,
if
those
governmental
functions
were
the
kind
of
policy
impositions
that
congress
was
imposing
with
the
low
level
radioactive
waste
act
at
issue
in
new
york,
that
forced
the
states
to
undertake
the
hard
policy
choices
that
congress,
in
fact,
made
here.
what
they
are...
here,
congress
is
simply
telling
the
states
to
do
something
that
local,
state,
and
federal
governments
have
done
for
a
very
long
time.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
only
policy
choice
that
i
think
you
could
honestly
call
a
policy
choice
that
congress
requires
the
chief
local
law
enforcement
officers
to
engage
in
here
is
one
that
creates
the
flexibility
of
the
brady
act.
it
is
telling
them
that
the
efforts
that
they
need
to
make
need
only
be
reasonable
efforts.
they
give
them
the
flexibility
to
decide--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--we
do
not...
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
it
is
voluntary.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
because
the
kind
of
policy
choice
that
he's
making...
if
you...
i
have
to
agree
that
you
can
call
anything
a
policy
choice.
i
don't
agree
that
the
way
this
act
works
imposes
or
forces
the
cleo
to
make
these
decisions
about
intrusiveness.
that
is
to
say,
he
decides
what
efforts
are
reasonable.
he
gets
guidance
from...
the
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
bureau
of
the
department
of
treasury
has
put
out
guidance
and
they
have
said--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--this
is,
i
think,
a
difficult
point
in
the
case,
but
i
think
it
is
a
policy
choice
so
limited
and
so
beneficial
in
its
flexibility...
that
is,
rather
than
saying
you
must
check
a
certain
number
of
records,
what
the
brady
act
says
is,
we're
going
to
give
you
flexibility
to
make
the
kind
of
choice
you
have
to
make
already,
of
how
you
allocate
your
resources.
what
brady
does
is
simply
to
add
one
more
additional
item
to
the
list
of
duties--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
first
of
all,
the...
it
is
emphatically
the
case
that
where
there's
a
prison
breakout
the
sheriff
has
the
discretion
to
do
no,
zero,
brady
act
checks
where
it's
not...
where...
this
is
entrusted
to
his
sound
discretion.
the
reason
that
the
reasonable
efforts
clause
is
put
in
there
is
precisely
so
that
he
could
choose
to
carry
out
his
state
functions
instead.
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--he
is
required
to
make
some
judgments.
he's
required
to
make
some
choices.
he
has
some
political
accountability
for
those
choices.
i
don't
deny
any
of
those
things,
but
all
of
the
political
responsibility
that
can
possibly
be
claimed
has
been
taken
by
the
federal
agencies
in
this
case.
you
can
call--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
souter,
when
the
state
says
you
may
not
do
any
brady
act
checks,
or
you
may
not
spend
a
penny
doing
brady
act
checks,
that
statute
is
preempted
under
the
supremacy
clause
by
the
brady
act.
the...
every
private
who
sorts
potatoes
thinks
that...
between
large
and
small
ones
thinks
that
when
you
get
a
medium
sized
potato
you're
making
a
policy
choice,
but
here,
it
is
only
in
the
flexibility
about
the
amount
of
resources
to
be
expended.
think
about
how...
the
same
choices
are
going
to
be
made
when
the
state
has
to
have
somebody
report
missing
children
to
a
national
system--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--if
there
are...
this
is
a
law
that
is
entrusted
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
law
enforcement
officer.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
my--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--my
answer
would
be
that
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
make
an
a
priori
determination
going
forward
that
this
was
always
the
last
matter
to
be
done.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
justice
o'connor
i
think
asked
an
important
question,
don't
many
cleo's
like
this
law,
and
they're
happy
to
comply
with
it.
i
mean,
the
answer
is
not
just
some,
the
answer
is
most,
but
i
mean...
in
fact,
they
wanted
this
duty.
they
want...
the
major
law
enforcement
organizations
wanted
this
duty
placed
on
local
law
enforcement
for
some
of
the
reasons
justice
kennedy
suggested.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
point
is
that
they
wanted
it
for
a
very
good
reason,
for
the
reason
suggested
in
part
by
a
question
from
justice
kennedy,
that
the
alternative
of
having
these
duties
imposed
upon
a
substantial
federal
bureaucracy
when
they
are
more
easily
done
in
the
3,000
counties
that
have
more
local
familiarity--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--in
this
case
the...
given
the
fact
that
you
have,
for
example,
56
fbi
field
offices,
one
for
every
30
counties,
it
would
be
extraordinarily
inconvenient,
as
well
as
inefficient,
and
the
relevant
records
are
where
local
law
enforcement
is.
congress
didn't
do
this
simply
to
off-load
its
burdens.
that's
where
the
arrest
warrants
are
for
fugitives
from
justice
that
are
not
on
the
ncic,
where
you
could
look
up
the
local
search
warrants.
justice
o'connor
naturally
leads
to
the
question
why
not
make
it
voluntary
if
most
cleo's
want
it?
i
think
there's
something
much
more
serious
than
a
free
ride
or
problem
here.
this
is
a
chain
that
may
be
no
stronger
than
its
weakest
link,
and
i
think
the
reason
that
local
law
enforcement
offices
wanted
congress
to
make
this
mandatory
was
that
they
understood
that
if
you
have
one
county
in
a
region
or
a
state
that
simply
announces
we
are
not
going
to
look
up
and
find
out
whether
gun
buyers
are
felons,
that's
the
counties
where
felons
will
buy
their
guns--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--federalism
is
being
used
here,
justice
kennedy,
to
mitigate
in
this
case
the
effects
of
the
enormous
interstate
mobility
in
handguns
by
ensuring
that
there
is
some
effort
made
to
see
which
illegal
buyers
are
doing
so
before
guns
are
sold.
it--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
that
observation--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
kennedy,
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
agree
with
that
observation
and
i
think
that
in
a
sense
it
cuts
both
ways
here.
it
shows,
i
think,
that
congress
has
not
abused
the
fact
that
when
it's
acting
under
its
legislative
power
it
may
call
upon...
impose,
require
some
duties
on
local
offices.
it
has
not
abused
that,
even
though
i
think
the
founders
would
be
surprised.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
where
it's
necessary
and
proper.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
if
it
is
necessary
and
proper.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
take
your
question
to
be,
where
you
have
a
law
such
as
this
that
does
not
implicate
the
concerns
of
sovereignty
and
accountability,
what
happens
if
the
number
of
those
duties
expands
so
greatly
that
it
begins
to
inhibit
the
ability
of
the
states
to
carry
out
their
functions,
unlike
this
law,
which
builds
in
the
flexibility
to
carry
out
state
functions.
i
think
that
is
a
question
that,
of
course,
you
need
not
decide
here.
i
think
you...
because
of
justice
kennedy's
observation
about
how
rarely
congress
has
used
this,
you
will
probably
never
have
to
decide--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
standard
will
be,
justice
breyer...
the
standard
will
be
whether
you
have
so
seriously
interfered
with
the
ability
of
the
state
to
carry
out
its
own
functions,
in
light,
perhaps,
of
whether
it's
the
war
power
or
some
other
very
serious
national
emergency
that
is
causing
you
to
do
it.
it
is
not
unlike
a
question
that
would
come
up
under
other
issues,
even
under
laws
of
general
applicability
that
might
at
some
point
interfere
with
the
state's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
may,
justice
stevens,
with
respect
to
the
civil
war
amendments,
which,
i
think
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted,
were
designed
as
a--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--as
a
limit
on
it.
i
do
not
think
it
otherwise
varies,
except
that
it
is
important
not
to
wholly
disentangle
these
issues.
this
is
so
fully
within
congress'
commerce
power.
because
at
the
time
of
the
constitution
handguns
were
made
locally
by
craftsmen
and
available
only
locally,
it
is
due
in
significant
measure
to
commerce
among
the
states
and
the
extraordinary
mobility
of
handguns
that
guns
made
anywhere
are
now
available
everywhere
that
roads
or
waterways
or
airports
can
reach,
and
it
was
to
mitigate
the
harm
of
that
cheap
national
availability
that
congress
tried
to
take
steps
in
'68
to
prevent
those
guns
from
being
sold
to
persons
who
were
convicted
felons--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
it's
not
merely
their
availability,
but
the
fact
that
they
were
uniquely
well-situated.
the
frustration
is
that
a
gun
dealer
who
is
forbidden
to
sell
a
gun
to
a
convicted
felon
but
doesn't
know
who
they
are...
he
gets
a
form
that
they
check
off
that
says
they're
not
convicted
felons.
the
information
that
this
individual
may
be
a
convicted
felon
is
right
there
in
the
same
town.
it
may
be
a
few
blocks
away
in
the
office
of
the
local
law
enforcement
chief.
so
in
the
5
years
before
we
get
this
national
system
online,
which
will
itself
not
contain
all
of
the
categories
of
922(g)...
it's
a
rough
and
ready
way
to
get
the
most
readily
available
information
with
minimal
efforts
to
check
reasonable
records.
it
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world
in
this
interim
period.
why
not
wait
until
there's
a
national
system
with
these
records
available
at
the
gun
dealer's
desk?
the
answer
is
that
there
are
13,000
handgun
murders
a
year
in
this
country.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
sometimes--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--sometimes--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--sometimes
the
solution
to
a
serious
problem
can't
be
reconciled
with
the
requirements
of
the
constitution,
but
this
is
not
such
a
case.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
say
that
it
doesn't
work
as
well--
[laughter]
--if
it
were
voluntary.
that
is
to
say,
if
one
cleo
could
put
up
a
sign
saying,
we
won't
check
for
records,
it
will
not,
but
it
nonetheless
works
as
congress
intended,
and
therefore
i
think
there's
no
serious
question
of
nonseverability
here.
thank
you.
