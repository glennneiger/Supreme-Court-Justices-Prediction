mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
ravalli,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
federal-state
context,
this
court
has
upheld
laws
passed
under
the
spending
power,
the
commerce
power,
including
the
power
to
preempt
state
legislation,
and
the
article
vi
duty
of
state
judges
to
hear
federal
causes
of
action.
the
interim
provisions
of
the
brady
act
at
issue
here
is
not
an
exercise
of
any
of
those
powers.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that,
in
essence,
congress
may
commandeer
the
sheriffs
departments
of
our
country
as
long
as
the
laws
concerned
do
not
interfere
unduly
with
their
duties.
the
only
alternative
for
the
states
is
to
enact
laws
which
meet
congress'
standards
to
get
out
from
under
or
exempt
themselves
from
the
federal
commands
to--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
correct.
as
of
january,
this
coming
january,
sheriff
mack--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--i
believe
it's
january
1,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
note
that
the
successor
in
office
has
been
identified
to
the
clerk,
and
i
believe
that
this
matter
will
be
addressed
further
in
the
future,
but
i
don't
think
it
will
be
moot.
depending
on...
under
this
court's
rule
the
succession
in
office
is
automatic,
is
my
understanding,
unless
that
person
withdraws.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
and
sheriff
mack
may
also
be
employed
by
a
police
department
in
the
same
county
and,
as
such,
would
continue
doing
the
same
kinds
of
duties
that
are
at
issue
here.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
he
would
continue
to
be
a
chief
law
enforcement
officer
as
defined
by
the
statute
here,
and
therefore
he
would
be
in
a
position
of
conducting
the
checks.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
in
both
cases
there
were
affidavits,
and
then
there
was
a
hearing
with
testimony,
and
i
would
refer
your
honor
in
the
printz,
the
petition,
the
appendix
to
the
printz
petition
for
cert,
the
affidavit...
i'm
sorry.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix.
that
will
be
at
page
9a
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
exhibits
at
19a,
and
then
a
partial
transcript
of
the
hearing
where
testimony
was
heard
at
page
25a,
and
in
the
mack
appendices
there
would
be
the
affidavit
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
5--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
in
regard
to
the
printz
case,
we
have
approximately
a
dozen
officers.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
checks
were
estimated
to
take
between
1
hour
per
day
and
several
days,
in
the
case
of
a
very
thorough
check.
in
the
case
of
mack,
we
have
testimony
that
the
checks
routinely
took
1
to
2
hours
per
day.
these
are
departments
where
between
one-and-a-half
and
two
officers
are
on
patrol
at
any
given
time.
these
are--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
just
an
average
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
graham
county
i
believe
there
were
10
deputies,
total,
employed
and
when
you
count
time
off
and
8-hour
days
and
what-not,
you
end
up
with
an
average
of
one-and-a-half
and,
in
the
case
of
ravalli
county,
montana,
we
have
about
two
on
patrol
at
any
given
time.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
not
at
all.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
not
at
all.
these
are
just
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
think
that
these
departments
could
have
plenty
of
staff
and
not
much
to
do
and
these
commands
would
be
unconstitutional.
we've
not
heard
cited
yet
a
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
that
justifies
these
commands.
we've
seen
a
lot
of
dancing
around
the
commerce
clause
and
article
vi
of
the
constitution
and
my
answer
is
no,
that
regardless
of
the
burden
or
lack
thereof,
that
these
commands
are
not
constitutional.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
your
honor,
that
comes
under
the
spending
power.
there
is
a
provision
in
regard
to
highway
funds
that
provides
that
to
get
the
highway
funds
there
are
a
number
of
burdens
on
the
states,
including
the
drinking
age
and
including--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
as
far
as
we
could
determine,
the
statutes
we
looked
at
that
were
prominently
cited
by
the
government...
the
one
that
you
mentioned,
the
fatalities
reporting,
and
then
the
reporting
the
missing
children
relates
to
the
national
crime
information
center,
which
is
a
voluntary
system
of
record
reporting
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states...
and
we
haven't
found
an
instance
where
there
was
not
some
nexus
with
receipt
of
a
grant
or
some
other--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--inducement
that
would
be
under
the
spending
power.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
in
our
view
that
clearly
comes
under
article
vi,
the
special
duty
of
state
judges
to
hear
federal
causes
of
action
and
to
do
other
things
that
congress
passes
that
relate
to
the
article
vi
provision
and
congress,
under
article
i,
section
8,
is
empowered
to
enact
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization,
and
we
interpret
those
early
naturalization
statutes
as
being
under
that
provision
and
then
being
applied
through
the
state
judiciary
through
article
vi.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
absolutely
not,
because
the
sheriff
is
not
a
state
judge,
and
article
vi
refers
explicitly
to
state
judges.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
and
the
state
judges
have
to
apply
that
through
article
vi,
so
i
think
the
clearest
example
of
the
early
congress
that
applies
here
was
the
same
day
that
congress
passed
the
tenth
amendment
they
passed
a
resolution
that
the
states
would
be
encouraged
to
enact
legislation
authorizing
state
local
officials,
rather,
to
keep
federal
prisoners
in
their
jails.
it
was
seen
as
a
completely
voluntary
function
for
which
the
sheriffs
would
be
paid.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
i
don't
know
whether
all
of
them
do.
i
know
that
several
of
them
do,
and
these
are
very...
some
of
them
are
very
obscure
laws.
i
don't
know
that
there's
ever
been
any
litigation
on
them,
so
i
cannot
say
that
there
is
a
specific
power
in
the
case
of
every
one
of
these
laws
that
one
could
link,
for
example,
to
the
spending
power.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
think
there
may
be
some
of
these
laws...
for
example,
i
believe
there's
one
cited
here
about
underground
storage
facilities,
where
the
states
are
supposed
to
inventory
and
report
underground
storage
facilities
and
frankly,
your
honor,
i
was
not
able
to
find
a
specific
item
in
that
statute
that
related
to
the
spending
power.
it's
just
one
of
those
obscure
laws
that
i'm
not
really
sure
what
the
basis
of
it
is.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
but
in
terms
of
precedents
for
this
law
that
we
have
here,
i
think
the
law
in
new
york
v.
united
states
was
one
that
was
on
all
fours
with
the
laws
here
in
terms
of
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--justice
stevens,
we
find
no
power
in
the
constitution
just
to
do
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
it
would
authorize
commerce
to
be
regulated,
but
it
would
not
authorize
the
immersion
of
the
states--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--to
do
that
kind
of
reporting,
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
reporting--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
the
way
they
do
that--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--now.
that
is
the
basis
for
this
law.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
no,
your
honor.
it's
a
very
vague
term,
and
basically
the
law
says
that
the
cleo,
or
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer,
shall
use
reasonable
efforts
to
ascertain
whether
receipt
or
possession
of
a
handgun
is
lawful,
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
including,
and
we
interpret
this
as
a
minimum
that
has
to
be
carried
out,
including
research
into
whatever
state
and
local
record-keeping
systems
are
available
and
in
the
national
system
designated
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
to
some
extent,
perhaps,
because
the
language
is
there,
but
i
think
that
there's
a
vanishing
point
or
an
ending
point.
if
he
doesn't
do
any...
makes
no
effort
whatever
to
conduct
these
background
checks
and
to
make
these
legal
determinations,
it
seems
that
he
is
not
making
a
reasonable
effort.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
i
don't
think
he
is
the
sole
judge,
because--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--we
would
have
no
case
if
it
was
totally
optional,
and
i
think
your
hypothetical
would
be
equivalent
to
changing
shall
to
may.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--as
i...
i
agree
with
you,
and
as
i
understood
the
question--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--as
i
understood
the
question,
there
will
be
no
duty
at
all,
and
if
there
is
any--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--i
would
still
have
one
problem
left,
i
think.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
which
is
the
perception
of
the
sheriff
as
not
being
a
law-abiding
sheriff.
in
other
words,
if
congress
enacts
a
law,
constituents
in
the
community,
many
of
them
think
the
law
should
be
enforced
if
it's
on
the
books,
and
the
sheriff
in
all
cases
decides
that
he
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
and
he
completely
rejects
any
execution
of
the
law
or
consideration
of
execution
of
the
law,
then
he
does
have
the
political
damage,
and
this
is
a
particular--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
i
think
it
would
still
come
under
the
prohibition
on
requiring
a
state
to
administer
a
federal
regulatory
program
in
the
sense
that
there's
got
to
be
some
kind
of
minimal
requirement.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
your
honor,
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--the
statute
broadly
says
whoever
violates
922(s)
is
subject
to
incarceration.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
and
the...
one
district
court
held
that
that
meant
exactly
what
it
said
in
the
mack
case,
that
that
was
a
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
when
the
law
was
first
enacted
and,
in
fact,
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
spokesman
on
this
law
said
that
there
were
criminal
penalties
that
applied
to
law
enforcement
officers.
however,
none
of
the
appellate
courts
have
held
that
the
criminal
penalties
apply.
they
have
held
basically
that
that
issue
is
moot
because
the
justice
department
interpreted
the
law
not
to
apply...
interpreted
criminal
penalties
not
to
apply
to
cleo's.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
my
position--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--it
says
whoever.
i
think
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
it
does
apply.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
what
i
have
to
say,
because
i
represent
real
clients
here,
is
that
if
the
government
says
they
don't
apply
and...
the
criminal
penalties
don't
apply
and
these
are
my
clients,
i'm
going
to
agree
with
the
government,
because
i
do
not
want
my
clients
subject
to
a
court
ruling
saying
that
criminal
penalties
apply
to
conduct.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
right.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
each
statute
and
what
the
criminal
penalties
say,
but
in
this
case--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
your
honor
it
says--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--it
says
dealers
shall
do
certain
things,
and
then
it
says
cleo's
shall
do
certain
things.
the
word
shall
appears
in
both,
and
if
you
want
to
say
that
the
criminal
penalties
don't
apply
to
the
sheriffs,
i
don't
know,
maybe
they
don't
apply
to
the
dealers,
either.
i
don't
know
who
they
apply
to.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
have
to
say,
frankly
we're
in
a
dilemma,
because
we're
faced
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
is
clear
enough,
and
when
we
went
into
this
litigation
we
asked
for
preliminary
injunctions
protecting
our
clients
from
criminal
prosecution,
and
then
the
justice
department
came
up
with
a
memorandum
saying
that
we're
not
going
to
interpret
the
law
in
that
way,
so
we
certainly
would
like
to
preserve
in
essence
these
letters
of
immunity
that
our
clients
are
not
pros--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--oh,
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
we
think
there's
other...
i
mean,
the
government
has
said--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--the
government
has
clearly
argued
that
they
could
bring
the
sheriffs
into
court
on
mandamus
or
injunction
actions
if
they
don't
enforce
these
laws.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
funds
are
specifically
prohibited
to
go
to
cleo's.
the
funds
are
for
the
updating
of
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
not
even
then,
because
by
november
of
1998
there
is
to
be
on
line
the
permanent
brady
act
provisions
under
which
the
federal
government
will
undertake
these
functions.
there
will
be
an
instant
check
where
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
basically,
will
be
conducting--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--background
checks,
and
all
of
our
tenth
amendment
problems
go
away
with
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
as
long
as
the
option
was
there--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--we
would
not
be
here,
absolutely
not.
but
there
was
no
money,
and
there
was
no
option
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
don't
know
how
the
word
voluntarily
would--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--they
are
complying.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
actually,
the
brady
act,
the
provisions
we're
talking
about
only
apply
in
about
half
the
states.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
maybe
24
states.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
some
states--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--yes,
your
honor.
some
states
already
had
laws
on
the
books
that
met
the
federal
criteria,
and
in
other
states--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
i
mean,
some
states
enacted
laws
to
get
out
from
under
this
provision.
that's
how
we
get
up
to
the
50
percent
of
the
states
are
exempt
from
this.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
and
then,
as
far
as
compliance,
i'm
not
sure
how
much
compliance
there
is,
even
in
the
states
where...
even
on
the
part
of
the
law
enforcement
personnel
who
support
this
law.
the
brief
of
the
state
of
maryland
and
other
states
says
that...
in
support
of
government
said
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
the
computer,
the
federal
computer
check,
and
that's
not
what
the
law
says.
it
seems
like
they're
nullifying
the
law
if
that's
all
they're
doing,
because
it--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--all
available
state
and
local
records.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
not
as--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--a
statute
that's
based
on
highway
funding,
yes.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
to
the
ncic.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
right.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
interpret
that
as
being
based
on
ncic.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
your
honor,
when
you
look
at
the
other
provisions
establishing
the
ncic--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--correct.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
in
our
constitution,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--it
says
that
the
president
shall
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed,
and
it
provides
for
a
federal
executive
branch
to
execute
the
laws
that
congress
passes.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--because
of
the
text
of
the
constitution
and
the
intent
of
the
framers
we've
rejected
the
so-called
new
jersey
plan
under
which
the
federal
laws
would
be
executed
by
state
and
local
officials,
and
that's
the
plan
that
we
have.
that's
our
constitution.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
they
pay
for
it--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--and
it--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--it's
also
clear
in
terms
of
political
responsibility
who's
responsible
for
enacting
the
law
and
executing
the
law,
and
that's
something
that's
broken
down
here.
we
have
congress
passing
a
law,
taking
credit
to
that
extent,
but
then
having
the
administration
of
the
law
being
imposed
on
the
shoulders
of
local
law
enforcement
officials.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
in
the
voting
act
cases,
we've
got
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
we've
got
several
other
amendments
that
relate
to
voting
rights.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
these
are
not
commercial
records
they
would
be
looking
at.
there's
no
nexus
to
interstate
commerce
if
they
want
to
go
through
the
records,
but
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
where
cooperative
federalism
really
works.
there's
always
been
the
sharing
of
information
voluntarily.
it's
not
a
problem.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
the
constitutional--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--authorization
would
be.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
access
from
a
police
department,
perhaps,
but
by
the
same
token,
there's
no
constitutional
power
that
the
states
would
have
to
require
the
federal
government
to
share
their
records,
but
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
comes
under
cooperative
federalism
where--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--absolutely
that
is
why
we're
here.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
a
hypothetical
question.
that
issue
hasn't
been
briefed
here.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--the
citation
to
the
authority
for
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
i
don't--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
our
position,
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
been
the
precedents
of
this
court
under--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
object
to
that,
and
we
don't
object
to
subpoenas.
this
court's
precedents
under
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--if
it's
a
law
that
applies
universally
under
this
court's
precedents
such
as
garcia,
this
law
would
be
valid.
if
it's--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
if
it's
records
related
to
criminal
conduct
and
subject
to
a
subpoena,
we
have
no
problem
at
all
with
those
records.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
thank
you,
your
honor.
