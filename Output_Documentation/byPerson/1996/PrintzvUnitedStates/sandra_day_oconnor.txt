justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
represent
both
sheriff
printz
and
sheriff
mack?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sheriff
mack
lost
the
election
for
sheriff
of
graham
county
in
the
last
election?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
date?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm,
and
will
the
case
likely
become
moot
as
to
sheriff
mack
on
that
date?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
chief
law
enforcement
officer.
clo.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
you
mind
telling
us
where
in
the
record
we
can
find
the
evidence
about
the
extent
of
the
burden
on
the
sheriffs
departments
in
enforcing
this
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
reference
to
the
record
where
we
can
find--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--maybe
you
can
file
that
with
the
clerk
later,
the
references,
please.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
like
to
summarize
for
us
what
it
showed
in
your
view
as
to
the
extent
of
the
burden?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
applications
are
filed
in
theses
two
counties,
and
how
much
time
of
the
deputies
is
required
to
deal
with
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
has
congress
imposed
a
burden
on
these
chief
law
enforcement
officers
to
report,
or
some
state
official
to
report
on
traffic
fatalities,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
exchange
for
receiving
the
highway
funds.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that...
excuse
me.
now,
the
government
has...
the
sg
has
filed
a
brief
citing
any
number
of
cases,
instances
through
the
years
where
congress
has
required
states
or
local
officials
to
perform
some
duties,
and
you
assert
that
in
every
case
it
was
linked
somehow
to
funding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
inducement
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
couldn't
congress
do
it
under
this
spending
help
they
give
the
states
for
the
road
systems?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
in
this
situation
are
there
not
criminal
penalties
for
someone
who
doesn't
follow
the
requirements
of
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
would
be
a
jury
that
would
be
interpreting,
presumably,
whether
the
sheriff
had
reasonably
performed
the
requirements
under
the
statute
and
could
result
in
a
criminal
punishment,
as
i
read
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wouldn't
they
go
away
as
well
if
the
government
offered
money
to
chief
law
enforcement
officers
to
administer
the
program,
and
you
would
have
an
option
whether
to
accept
the
money
and
administer
it
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
wouldn't
be
here
under
those
circumstances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
a
lot
of
chief
law
enforcement
officers
around
the
country
comply
voluntarily
with
this
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
are
complying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
like
40
states
or
more?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
of
them
have
enacted
their
own
program,
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that's
sufficient?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
some
are
complying
without
protest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
says
states
as
well,
does
it
not,
records?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
an
extreme
position.
i
thought
you
were
here
taking
the
position
that
this
particular
program
required
the
county
to
expend
its
efforts
and
occupy
the
time
of
their
deputies
to
devote
first
and
foremost
to
the
execution
of
this
particular
law,
as
opposed
to
their
own
needs
for
hunting
murderers
or
rapists
or
robbers.
i
thought
that
was
the
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you're
changing
your
position--
--and
i
think
that's
totally
different
when
you
say
no,
we
wouldn't
even
agree
that
a
law
that
says
a
federal
agent
can
come
and
look
at
state
records--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--would
be
allowed.
i
mean,
that's
a
remarkable
difference
in
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
whether
you
think
that
under
the
constitutional
framework
we
have,
which
preserves
states
as
sovereign
entities,
the
congress
can
pass
a
law
mandating
that
every
state
administer
congress'
welfare
plan
without
offering
financial
assistance
and
an
option
to
the
states
to
do
that?
can
they
just
pass
a
law
saying
we
think
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
resolve
issues
of
poverty,
and
we
mandate
the
states
to
carry
out
our
extensive
program
that
we
devise,
and
the
states
are
to
manage
it.
no
money,
no
option.
you
go
do
it,
states.
or
some
health
program,
or
some
state
highway
safety
program,
same
thing.
can
congress
just
pass
it,
and
without
giving
the
states
and
option
or
funding
for
it
say,
you
attend
to
this,
states.
you
manage
it.
you
enforce
these
laws
we
pass.
can
they
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
it
does
when
congress
says,
we're
passing
this
law
and
setting
a
national
standard
for
health
care,
or
welfare--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
highway
safety,
and
passes
it
off
to
the
states
directly
to
administer
those
programs,
not
giving
them
an
option,
not
funding
it.
not
giving
them
an
option
to
take
money
and
participate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
is
just
a
smaller
version
of
that
example--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
justice
scalia
has
addressed
that
point
in
exploring
whether
taking
away
the
policy
choices
saves
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
notion
that
the
federal
government
can
just
commandeer
state
and
local
government
totally
to
administer
some
federally
enacted
program,
all
the
details
of
which
are
spelled
out,
is
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
has
to
be
done
in
5
days,
and
so
the
local
county
has
some
massive
prison
escape,
or
riots
going
on,
and
the
sheriff
can't
send
his
deputies
out
to
deal
with
that
because
he's
only
got
5
days
to
apply,
and
doesn't
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
take
a
position
in
the
memo
that
the
criminal
penalties
do
apply
to
these
sheriffs?
i
think
there
are
some
problems--
