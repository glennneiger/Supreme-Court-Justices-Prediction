justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
don't
think
that
under
the
uniform
rule
of
naturalization
that
congress
could
compel
state
sheriffs
to
make
background
checks
of
aliens,
do
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
so...
but
i
don't
think
a
whole
lot
turns,
then,
on
the
power
of
congress
to
pass
uniform
rules
of
naturalization.
congress
is
acting
within
its
appropriate
sphere,
just
as
it
acts
within
its
appropriate
sphere
under
the
commerce
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
something
of
a
paradox
in
this
whole
area,
is
there
not,
in
that
if
you
prevail
it
means
that
you
1)
have
a
huge
federal
bureaucracy,
or
2)
withdrawal
of
funds,
perhaps
funds
well
in
excess
of
what...
the
funds
that
you
would
really
expend
in
this
area.
in
a
way,
if
you
prevail
you
might
be
striking
a
blow
for
big
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
assuming
a
complete
revision
of
the
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
the
state
require
the
federal
government
to
do
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
doesn't
it
work
in
reverse?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
there's
a
federal
design
here,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
is
consistent
with
the
political
relation
that
subsists
between
the
citizens
to
have
one
government
interfere
with
another.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
the
congress
had
said
that
because
we
have
an
emergency
here
and
we're
not
up
and
running,
that
for
5
years
gun
permits,
gun
transfer
forms
will
be
processed
by
the
house
of
representatives
in
their
field
offices,
in
their
home
offices.
the
entire
burden
of
complying
with
the
act
was
up
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
the
individual
congressmen
and
their
staffs.
that
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
separation
of
powers,
would
it
not?
you
don't
think
the
congress
itself
could
administer
this
scheme
through
its
congressional
field
offices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
saddles...
it
saddles--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
because
there
are
some
very
basic
notions
of
accountability
that
underlie
separation
of
powers.
why
should,
if
the
congress
could
not
ignore
separation
of
powers,
how
can
it
ignore
the
federal
balance
when
the
same
consideration
are
applicable...
that
is
to
say,
a
blurring
of
political
accountability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my
hypothetical
was
a
rather
strange
hypothetical--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
will
admit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
is,
as
the
constitution
recognizes,
that
each
branch
of
the
government,
state
and
federal,
has
to
make
a
certain
cost-benefit
choice,
and
if
congress
wants
to
have
some
huge
program,
i
suppose
it
can
pay
the
political
cost
for
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
federalism
is
now
being
used
to
ensure
uniformity.
i
thought
it
was
for
just
the
opposite
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
with
me
that
this
is
a
very
rare
exercise
of
federal
power?
i
noticed
in
your
brief
that
you
could
find
very
few
examples.
it's
surprising
how--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
it's
surprising
how
often
the
federal
government
tells
the
state...
or
how
rarely
it
tells
a
state
you
must
do
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
opposed
to
the
fact
that
you
shouldn't
do
something
under
the
supremacy--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
congress
has
done
here
is
say
local
police
officers
are
available
throughout
the
country
also,
and
therefore
we
can
regulate--
