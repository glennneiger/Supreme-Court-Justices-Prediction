justice
david
h.

mr.
halbrook,
the
obligation,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
part
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
is
to
use
reasonable
efforts.
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
whatever's
reasonable.
is
there
in
the
statute
any
mechanism
for
review
by
anybody
as
to
whether
a
given
law
enforcement
officer
did
use
reasonable
efforts?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
it
would
be
open
to
a
court,
to
this
court
to
construe
that
reasonable
effort
criterion
as
one
which
turns
on
the
law
enforcement
officer's
own
view
of
what
in
relation
to
all
of
his
other
responsibilities,
and
in
relation
to
his
resources,
is
reasonable?
can
he
be
the
judge
of
reasonableness?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
unless
he
is
the
judge
of
reasonableness.
if
he
were
the
sole
judge
of
reasonableness,
so
that
there
was,
in
effect,
no
review
of
the
adequacy
of
his
efforts,
would
you
have
a
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i'm
asking
you
to
assume
my
hypothesis.
if
he
were...
if
the
statute
were
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
him
the
sole
judge,
would
you
have
a
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
that
wasn't
the
question.
no,
the
question
was...
no,
i'm
sorry.
the
question
was,
there
was
no
review,
that
the
final
decision
as
to
what
was
reasonable
would
be
the
decision
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
and
there
would
be
no
review
of
that
decision.
that's
the
hypothesis.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
that
hypothesis,
would
you
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
would
have...
and
i
think
your
point
is
well-taken,
but
would
that...
would
that
place
him
in
the
position
that
the
opinion
in
the
new
york
case,
for
example,
described
as
being
essentially
an
agent
or
employee,
as
it
were,
of
the
national
government
to
carry
out
a
national
government
policy?
it
might
put
him
in
a
political
spot,
i
think
you're
right.
but
would
that
rise
to
the
level
of
the
obligation
that
in
the
broader
passages
in
the
new
york
case
was
condemned
as
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
is
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
the
criminal
penalties
apply
to
your
client?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
position
that
it
does
apply,
that
you're
taking
the
position
before
us
that
your
clients
are
subject
to
the
criminal
penalties?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
your
position
here,
as
you
announced
it
a
moment
ago,
is
the
justice
department
says
those
penalties
don't
apply
to
the
sheriffs
and
that's
your
position
here
too,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
saying
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
require
that
challenge.
wasn't
that
your
answer
to
justice
stevens?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
take
criminal--
justice
david
h.
souter
--just
take
criminal
records,
for
example,
not
necessarily
tied
to
commerce.
you
mean
it
would...
i
take
it
it's
your
position
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
require
access
by
a
federal
investigator
to
state
conviction
records,
is
that
correct?
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
that
enough
of
a
policy
choice
to
create
the
problem?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
even
assuming
that
the
scheme
is
not
voluntary,
and
i
take
it
you're
not
conceding
that
it
is,
the
local
law
enforcement--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right,
so
that
the
local
law
enforcement
officer
has
got
a
real
policy
choice,
number
1,
in
choosing
between
his
brady
act
responsibilities
and
whatever
other
local
law
enforcement
abilities
he's
got,
and
number
2,
i
suppose
even
independently
of
that,
he's
at
least
got
an
initial
policy
choice
to
make
about
how
intrusive
an
investigation
is
reasonable
enough,
and
i
would
suppose
that
that
latter
decision
could
be
politically
a
very
explosive
one
in
some
communities.
so
even
on
your
own
standard,
why
isn't
that
enough
for
unconstitutionality?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be
fine,
but
the
people
who
are
being
investigated
i
don't
think
either
know
or
much
care
that
there
may
be
a
batf
memo,
and
the...
to
the
extent
there
is
flexibility
it's
the
local
officer's
choice
and,
to
the
extent
that
he
is
even
exercising
guidance
from
batf
in
his
relationship
to
his
constituents,
he
is
still
being
placed,
in
effect,
in
the
position
of
a
policymaker.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
a
situation
in
which
the
county
says,
as
a
footnote
to
the
budget,
not
a
penny
of
the
sheriff's
budget
is
going
to
be
spent
doing
brady
act
investigations.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
the
point
of
political
accountability
at
that
point
is
directly
on
the
sheriff.
