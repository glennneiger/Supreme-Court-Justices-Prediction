justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
think
that
that's
determinative
here,
how
extensive
the
incursion
upon
the
officer's
duties
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
would
the
statute
be
constitutional
as
to
those
officers
who
didn't
take
a
large
proportion
of
their
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
unconstitutional
as
to
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
isn't
optional.
i
mean,
if
i'm...
if
i
am
compelled
to
make
an
honest
judgment
about
whether
i
have
the
resources
to
do
this,
presumably
i'm
not
going
to,
you
know,
perjure
myself,
and
i
will
therefore
as
a
practical
matter
be
compelled
to
use
resources
if
they
are
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
therefore
your
answer
should
be,
we
would
continue
to
have
a
case
because
it
would,
indeed,
continue
to
compel
the
state
officers
to
do
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
reasonable
enough
position,
isn't
it?
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes,
for
example,
that
impose
civil
penalties
and
criminal
penalties
upon
regulatory
violations
and
they
have
a
general
penalty
provision
that
says
whoever
violates--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
law,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
provisions
in
the
statute
that
require
the
secretary
to
conduct
rulemaking,
that
require
the
secretary
to
do
this
or
that.
i
don't
know
anybody
who's
ever
tried
to
prosecute
the
secretary
if
he
fails
to
conduct
a
rulemaking.
i
mean,
it's
a
violation
of
the
apa,
but
it's
hard
to
say
he's
in
violation
of
the
act
within
the
meaning
of
the
penalty
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
reasonable
way
to
interpret
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
that,
you
know,
we're
going
to
go
after
the
sheriffs?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
when
the
federal
government
executes
the
laws
the
federal
government
also
has
to
pay
for
their
execution,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
vote
for
a
massive
regulatory
program
you
also
have
to
vote
for
the
taxes
at
the
federal
level,
which
makes
federal
representatives
less
popular
back
home.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
much
easier
if
you
allow
the...
impose
an
obligation
on
the
states
to
do
it
and
the
state
legislators
can
take
the
heat
by
raising
the
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
it
was
10
minutes
a
month
in
the
execution
of
a
federal
law,
10
minutes
a
month
in
acting
in
an
executive
capacity
to
implement...
not
to
obey,
but
to
implement
a
federal
law.
isn't
there
a
difference
between
that
and
simply
obeying
a
subpoena
for
documents,
or
a
statute
that
requires
information
to
be
provided,
which
statute
could
apply
to
public...
to
private
individuals
as
well
as
to
a
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
requiring
information
to
be
turned
over
is
something
that
you
can
do
vis-a-vis
a
private
citizen.
it
doesn't
treat
the
government
as
a
government.
you're
treating
the
state
as
a
governmental
institution,
however,
when
you
require
it
to
enforce
a
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
where
it
wouldn't
put
the
states
in
the
position
of
making
any
policy.
it's
a
federally
designed
welfare
program.
all
the...
every
jot
and
tiddle
of
it
is
set
forth
in
painful
detail
in
the
statute.
your
answer,
then,
would
have
to
be,
then
it
would
be
okay.
congress
could
go
home
and
say,
well,
we've
balanced
the
budget,
having
left
all
of
the
welfare
cost
to
the
states.
your
answer
would
be
yes,
that's
constitutional,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
policy
judgments
left
to
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
think
that
it
is...
and
this
is
what
the
government's
brief
says.
it
seems
to
me
totally
counterintuitive
that
it
is
better
when
you
leave
the
states
no
option,
no
policy
judgments
at
all,
and
make
them
simply
dance
like
marionettes
on
the
fingers
of
the
federal
government.
that's
okay.
but
it
is
bad
if
you
leave
the
states
some
policy
judgment.
i
mean,
that's
so
counterintuitive.
why
wouldn't
that
make
it
worse,
to
leave
them
no
policy
judgment,
rather
than
make
it
better?
justice
antonin
scalia
new
york
v.
united
states
gave
the
states
an
option.
they
could
manage
the
waste
or
they
could,
by
taking
over
it
themselves,
act
purely
executively
rather
than
legislatively.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
have
been
purely
executive
action.
that
option
was
available
in
new
york,
and
we
nonetheless
held
that
it
was
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
believe
there's
any
such
unfunded
mandate.
what
unfunded
mandates
are
you
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
don't
do
it,
we'll
do
it,
and
the
states
do
it
simply
to
avoid
having
the
federal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
don't
have
to
do
it.
if
you
don't
have
to
do
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we'll
send
the
feds
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
governmental
duties
cannot
be
imposed,
is
all
he's
saying.
if
it's
informational...
or
it's
all
he
should
be
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
get
information--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
can
get
information
from
the...
from
a
government
just
as
it
can
get
information
from
an
individual,
but
to
require
a
government
to
perform
governmental
functions
is
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
unpleasant
policy
choices
are
left
for
the
local
government.
they...
the
local
government
does
not
have
to
decide
whether
(a)
to
raise
taxes,
or
(b)
to
divert
police
officers
from
hunting
murderers
and
rapists
to
looking
up
these
records,
or
(3)...
i
don't
know
what,
to
declare
bankruptcy.
aren't
these
all
unpleasant
policy
choices
that
the
government
has
imposed
upon
the
localities?
justice
antonin
scalia
--doesn't
the
reasonableness
include
the
amount
of
funding
that
the
county
gives
the
sheriff?
doesn't
the
county
have
to
provide
enough
funding
to
allow
him
to
do
this
duty
that's
been
imposed
upon
him?
wouldn't
it
be
declared
unreasonable
if
the
county
clearly
has
not
provided
the
sheriff's
office
enough
funds
to
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
federal
system
is
often
inefficient,
is
all
that
you're
saying.
i
mean...
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
not
many
countries
in
the
world
have
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lot
easier
to
do
everything,
you
know,
by
command
from--
