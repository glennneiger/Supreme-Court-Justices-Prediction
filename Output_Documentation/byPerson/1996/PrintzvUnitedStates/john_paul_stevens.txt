justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
he
wouldn't
be
a
ceo
then,
would
he--
--yes.
--or
whatever
you
call
the...
he
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
not
about
precedent
but
just
about
your
theory
of
the
case?
is
it
your
position
that,
without
having
any
spending
power
at
all,
but
just
acting
under
the
commerce
clause,
congress
would
not
have
the
power
to
have
states
report
to
it
the
number
of
fatalities
involving
children
caused
by
airbags
for...
in
30-day
period,
or
something
like
that?
it
would
not
have
the
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
power...
i
suppose
the
argument
would
be
the
power
is
to
regulate
commerce,
and
they're
trying
to
improve
safety
on
the
highways
and
all
the
rest
of
it
by
getting
this
data,
but
you'd
say
that
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
authorize
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
requiring
information
to
be
provided
by
the
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
understand
your
brief,
your...
in
your
view
the
statute
would
be
equally
unconstitutional
whether
it
has
the
criminal
penalties
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
why
are
we
fussing
about
this
issue,
i
wonder.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
you
have
to
answer
questions
that
are
put.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position
now,
prompted
by
justice
kennedy's
question.
supposing
they
amended
the
statute
to
say
that
all
the
investigations
shall
be
done
by
federal
employees,
fbi
agents
or
something,
but
that
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
each
community
must
make
available
to
the
federal
officer
any
records
that
will
help
him
find
out
this
information,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
position,
counsel,
has
been
that
there's
a
lack
of
power
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
if
it's
10
minutes
a
month
required
by
the
officer,
if
the
federal
government
orders
it,
you
can't
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
10
minutes
a
month
or
10
minutes
a
year.
that's
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
private
citizens
cannot
open
up
public
records.
private
citizens
don't
have
authority
to
make
public
records
available.
if
the
state
has
its
own
secret
files
on
people
who
violated
the
law,
the
question
is,
can
the
federal
government
command
the
state
to
make...
give
access
to
those
documents,
and
you
say
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
a
subpoena.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
dellinger,
may
i
ask
you
one
basic
question?
do
you
think
the
tenth
amendment
has
different
meaning,
depending
on
what
affirmative
exercise...
what
power
of
congress
it
is
relying
on,
whether
it's
the
commerce
clause,
the
war
powers
clause,
the
spending
clause?
does
the
tenth
amendment
vary
in
its
meaning,
depending
on
the
clause,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
