justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
just
the
question
that
i
have,
actually.
i
mean,
if
you
track
this
through,
i
take
it
there's
a
statute,
for
example,
which
says
that
states
have
to
report
missing
children,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not...
i
just
see
they're
setting
up
a
task
force,
and
they
say
in
the
task
force...
what
it
says
here
is
every
federal,
state,
and
local
law
enforcement
shall
report
each
case
of
a
missing
child
under
age
18.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right.
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
whether
you
take
money,
you
don't
take
money,
so
i
take
it
you're
saying
that's
unconstitutional,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
anything
here
that
says
you
have
to
do
it
only
if
you
take
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
if
it
says
you
only
have
to
do
it
if
you
take
money,
then
i'm
not
right.
it's
not
a
good
example.
there
must
be
an
example,
maybe
it's
this
case,
where
congress
has
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
say,
report
some
things,
right?
but
the
issue
is
whether
it's
necessary
and
proper.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
issue.
now,
why
is
it
that
in
germany,
in
switzerland,
in
the
common
market,
in
many
other
federal
associations,
people
think
it
is
more
respectful
of
the
states
to
impose
minor
duties
upon
state
officials
than
to
set
up
central
bureaucracies?
where
is
it
in
our
history,
or
our
constitution,
or
in
the
language,
that
it
is
more
respectful
of
states
to
have
a
nationwide
computer
system
run
by
the
fbi
than
to
impose
minor
reporting
requirements
on
state
officials?
what
is
it
in
law,
or
history,
or
anything
you
want
to
refer
to
that
says
it's
more
consistent
with
states
rights?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
is
that
more
respectful
of
state
rights
to
set
up,
let's
say,
a
federal
police
service
than
to
say
the
local
police
service
has
to
report
a
few
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
countries
they
think
the
opposite,
and
so
what
i'm
looking
for
is
history
or
language
that
says
why
it
is
here
the
opposite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they
pay
a
million
dollars,
if
they
pay
a
million
dollars
of
the
cost,
if
the
state
says,
we
don't
want
your
million
dollars,
we
don't
want
a
billion
dollars,
we
don't
want
to
do
it,
period--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
your
position,
they
can't
be
forced--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can
do
that
with
the
environment,
can't
they?
i
mean,
aren't
there
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
of
unfunded
mandates
that
the
states
complain
about
and
create
a
political
issue?
i
mean,
what's
the
line?
from
what
i
read,
the
camel
is
lots
and
lots
of
money
in
obligations
that
congress
imposes
upon
the
states
all
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
principle
of
federalism
that
says
they
can
do
that
but
asking
a
police
officer
to
report
a
missing
child,
or
asking
a
police
officer
to
report
a
safety
statistic,
or
to
look
something
up
in
a
computer,
suddenly
is
a
violation
of
the
tenth
amendment,
but
imposing
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
of
costs,
as
congress
does
in
many
laws,
is
not?
what's
the
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know...
mandates
in...
i'm
not
saying
here.
i
just
read
in
the
newspaper--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
there
is
a
thing
called
unfunded
mandates--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
the
states
complain
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
it
is
necessary
and
proper
in
carrying
out--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it
is
necessary
and
proper.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--necessary
and
proper
on
occasion
to
impose
minor
duties,
but
not
take
over
whole
programs
and
implementation
of
enormous
kinds
of
welfare
programs
or
whatever,
what's
the
distinction?
what
is
it
that
makes
it
okay
to
impose
a
duty
upon
a
state
court
to
hear
federal
cases,
upon
a
governor
to
extradite
officials,
upon
policemen
to
report
missing
children,
but
doesn't
impose
a
duty
upon
those
same
officials
that's
really
much
more
burdensome
than
that.
what's
the
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
interpret
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
get
there,
in
light
of
the
tenth
amendment
interests,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
well,
my
particular
question
is--
