mr.
william
h.
dempsey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
that
is
raised
in
this
case
is
whether
a
particular
provision
in
a
maine
statute
dealing
with
property
tax
exemptions
for
charitable
organizations
is
or
is
not
constitutional.
the
challenge
to
the
statute
is
laid
upon
the
commerce
clause
in
its
dormant
or
negative
aspect,
that
is,
without
the
existence
of
any
relevant
congressional
action
under
the
proviso
a
charity
that
is
otherwise
entitled
to
receive
the
exemption
is
denied
that
exemption
if,
to
use
the
words
of
the
statute,
it
is
conducted
or
operated
principally
for
the
benefit
of
persons
who
are
not
residents
of
maine.
now,
the
petitioner
is
such
a
charity.
it
was
denied
the
exemption
on
those
grounds,
and
that
really
is
the
core
of
the
case.
now,
the
remaining
facts
are
simple.
they're
not
contested.
i
can
summarize
them
quite
swiftly.
the
matter
was
disposed
of
on
summary
judgment
below.
the
petitioner
is
a
maine
corporation.
its
only
activity
is
to
conduct
a
summer
camp
for
children
in
the
town
that
is
now
harrison
that
is
the
respondent
in
this
case.
it
is
dedicated
to
serving
christian
science
families.
there
are
not
a
great
many
christian
science
families
in
the
state
of
maine,
and
accordingly
it
recruits
and
advertises
outside
the
state
broadly,
and
it
serves
principally
people,
children
who
are
not
residents
of
the
state
of
maine.
indeed,
during
the
three
tax
years
in
question
about
95
percent
of
the
campers
that
were
served
at
the
camp
came
to
the
camp
from
other
states,
states
other
than
maine.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well,
they're
not--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--surely.
the
purpose,
justice
scalia,
which
is
asserted...
and
let
me
go
directly
to
that.
the
purpose
that
is
asserted
to
be
the
purpose
on
the
face
of
this
statute
is
a
quite
reasonable
purpose.
it
is
to
confine
the
dedication
of
the
resources
of
the
state,
of
the
community,
to
the
benefit
in
these
particular
areas
of
residence
of
that
state.
now,
that
purpose
is
as
legitimate
as
the
purposes
that
were
served
in
the
waste
disposal
cases
that
you've
had
before
you,
the
purposes
of
encouraging
private
industry,
all
the
purposes
that
are
listed
in
the
opinion
of
the
courts
in
chemical
waste,
for
example.
there's
nothing
at
all
sinister
about
the
purpose.
the
question,
as
in
almost
all
of
these
cases,
is
whether
or
not
the
means
that
were
adopted
to
achieve
that
purpose
impacted
improperly
upon
interstate
commerce.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--well--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--let
me
try
to
address
that
question
in
the
two
aspects
in
which
i
understand
it.
in
terms
of
its
being
a...
the
equivalent
of
a
tax
expenditure,
your
first
point,
that,
as
i
believe
you
yourself
have
indicated
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
west
lynn
creamery
case,
is
true
of
all
exemption
and
credit
cases,
and
the
court,
as
you
pointed
out,
has
always
regarded
tax
exemptions
and
credits
as
being
the
equivalent
of
taxes
themselves.
so
that
if
you
take
a
case
that
i
think
is
closely
on
point,
the
darnell
case,
involving
a
property
tax
again,
exemption
upon
lumber
that
was
produced
in
the
state
that
was
involved,
an
exemption
for
that
lumber
but
not
for
others,
that
amounts
to
a
tax
expenditure,
or,
if
you
wish,
a
subsidy.
in
the
bacchus
case,
the
exemptions
that
were
granted
there
to
the
liquors
that
were
produced
in
the
state
of
hawaii
were
in
fact
tax
expenditures
on
behalf
of
those
people,
of
those
manufacturers.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
that's
precisely
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
this
court
has
treated
them
the
same.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
precisely.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
that's
a
very
interesting
question.
let
me
try
to
move
into
it
more
gradually,
if
you
will,
and
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
market
participation
question
that
justice
scalia
raised,
because
these
are
really
the
dual,
dual
justifications
that
the
state
advances
in
this
case.
either
it's
like
market
subsidy...
market
participation,
or
it's
like
subsidy,
or
both.
let
me
just
preliminarily,
though,
note
a
problem
with
that
argument.
the
state,
as
you
know,
is
not
here.
the
state
participated...
it
intervened
as
a
defendant
in
the
trial
court,
but
when
it
lost
it
did
not
pursue
its
appeal
to
the
maine
law
court,
and
it
has
not
taken
advantage
of
its
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
proceeding,
so
the
defense
of
the
state
statute
is
left
to
the
town
of
harrison.
excuse
me,
justice--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--i...
yes,
i'm
sure
that's
right,
but...
in
terms
of
fact,
but
the
reason
for
the
state's
participating
at
the
trial
court
level
and
not
appealing
is
a
matter
that
i
am
in
no
position
to
comment
on
at
all.
there
may
be
precedent
for
that
in
this
court,
but
i've
not
seen
a
case
in
which
a
state
statute
has
been
attacked
as
unconstitutional
in
which
the
state
participated
in
the...
at
the
trial
court
level
and
then
abandoned
the
case
coming
before
you,
but
i--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--town's
tax.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
yes.
yes,
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
yes,
so
you
could--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well,
i...
let
me
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
no.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
you
were
to
take
that
view
and
distinguish
between
the
real
estate
and
personal
property
taxes,
for
example,
because
after
all
personal
property
does
move,
then
you
would
have
an
awkward
situation
here,
because
part
of
this
tax
was
personal
property,
and
part
was
realty.
my
first
point
is
that
that
makes
an
awkward
distinction
in
this
particular
case,
as
it
would
in
any
case.
my
second
response
would
be
that,
consider
darnell.
that
was
a
personal
property
tax
on
lumber
that
was
brought
into
the
state
from
another
state,
the
exemption
being
given
to
lumber
that
was
produced
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
now,
if
they
could
escape
the
effect
of
darnell
simply
by
transforming
the
form
of
the
tax,
they
could
then
levy
the
tax
on
the
real
property,
the
warehouse
in
which
the
lumber
was
stored.
now,
i'm
suggesting
that
if
that
kind
of
an
exception
is
made,
it
would
open
the
door
to
all
kinds
of
manipulation
of
taxes
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
that
single
loophole.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
now...
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
well--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--all
right--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
i
understand...
i
understand,
justice
scalia,
the
force
of
that
reaction
to
the
case.
now,
let
me
try
to
catch
up
with
the
strands
of
questions
that
i
have,
because
they're
all
related,
and
i
don't
want
to
lose
track
of
any
one
of
them.
let
me
go
to
the
church
support
by
property
tax,
because
that's
in
a
way
related
to
the
very
last
question
you
asked,
justice
scalia.
i
suggest
to
you
that...
and
the
market
dominant,
market
participation
and
the
subsidy
issue.
i
suggest
that
if
the
state
were
here,
it
would
be
very,
very
reluctant
to
make
the
market
participation
or
subsidy
argument.
there
are
in
every
state...
i'm
sure
there
are
statutes,
exemption
statutes
for
church
property.
now,
if,
as
the
respondent
argues,
what
the
state
is
doing
here
by
virtue
of
market
participation
is
somehow
purchasing
camping
services
for
the
benefit
of
its
residents,
or
subsidizing
the
camps
for
the
benefit
of
its
residents,
then,
by
parity
of
reasoning,
it
is
somehow
purchasing
religious
services
from
the
churches.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
oh,
i'm
sure
it
doesn't
fall
afoul
of
establishment,
justice
souter,
but
the
reason
it
doesn't
is
because
it's
not
market
participation.
the
state,
as
justice
scalia,
as
in
the
new
energy-limbach
case,
the
state
here
is
not
purchasing
anything
from
anyone.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
a
service
gratis,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
all
right,
well
let
me
address...
but
just
before
i
forget,
justice
o'connor,
on
the
subsidy
question,
of
course,
the
subsidy
defense
does
not
have
the
same
quality
of
imprimatur
from
this
court
as
yet
as
the
market
participation
test
does,
but
as
i've
indicated,
for
my
purposes
i'm
perfectly
wiling
to
assume,
arguendo,
that
any
sort
of
a
subsidy
is
immune
from
the
dormant
commerce
clause
just...
because
this
just
isn't
subsidy,
that's
all.
it's,
as
in
limbach,
it's
a
tax,
as
justice
scalia
said.
it's
the
primeval
function
of
the
government
in
laying
and
collecting
taxes.
now,
what
is
suggested
is
that...
and
i
really
thought
from
the
start
that
this
is
the
way
in
which
this
case
might
develop.
it
really
hasn't
developed
this
way
until
right
now,
and
that
is
to
suggest
that
there
is
some
sort
of
an
exception
for
charities
that
is
analogous
to
the
market
participation,
or
the
subsidy
of
that,
indeed,
as
an
exception.
now,
the
respondent
abstains
from
making
that
argument.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
a
good
argument,
but
i
point
out
that
we
did
say
at
the
outset
well,
let's
consider,
this
issue,
and
the
respondent
says
no,
we're
not
trying
to
draw
that
distinction.
i
think
myself
that
the
respondent
is
correct
in
doing
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
it
can't
possibly...
or
shouldn't,
anyway,
make
a
difference
whether
you're
dealing
with
a
nonprofit
or
a
profit.
let
me
just
start
at
that
sort
of
primitive...
on
that
primitive
basis.
nonprofits
in
this
country,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
are
big
business
in
every
sense
of
the
word,
except
that
they
don't
make
a
profit.
in
terms
of
their
employment,
in
their
purchases,
in
their
interstate
commerce
that
they
affect,
they
are
big
business.
now,
instead
of
taking
camps
for
a
moment...
but
they're
in
business.
they're
in
business
in
the
state
of
maine,
as
justice
souter,
i'm
sure,
is
aware.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
correct.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
no.
well,
yes.
excuse
me.
no,
you're
quite
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
if
they
have
a
modest
charge
then
they
get
a
modest
exemption,
but
if
they
charge
more
than
$30
then
they
lose
the
exemption
entirely.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--no,
we're
talking
about
nonprofits
here
who
serve
primarily
citizens
of
maine
whom
they
charge
$1,000
a
week,
who
get
the
exemption.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
if
they're
serving
primarily
or
principally
maine
citizens,
then
they
may
charge
$1,000
or
$2,000,
and
they
get
the
exemption.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
no.
if
you
serve
primarily
out-of-state
citizens
but
only
charge
$30
a
week,
then
you
lose
only
part
of
your
exemption.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
so--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--the...
oh,
the
tax
in
this...
if
you're
asking
about
the--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--what
is
the
value
of
the
property.
in
this
case,
the
tax
in
each
of
the
tax
years
in
question
averaged
about
$22,000,
so
it
does
depend
entirely
on
the...
so
what
you
have--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--yes.
so
what
you
have--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--right.
you
have--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--a
protected
relationship
with
the
state,
nursing
homes,
camps,
some
of
which
are...
many
of
which
are
nonprofit,
but
they
are
in
competition
directly
with
these
charities,
so-called
charities,
and
these
people
lose
the
exemption,
and
they
lose
the
exemption
because
they
serve
too
many
people
from
out
of
state.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
the
hospitals
are
not
covered
by
this
provision
of
the
statute,
justice
stevens,
and
i
should
point
that
out.
this
proviso
applies
only
to
the...
now,
i'm
saying
that
without
really
being
certain,
and
i'm
going
to
consult,
when
i
sit
down
with
my
colleague,
mr.
dale
from...
because
what
we
have
in
the
state
of
maine,
and
it's
not
my
field,
goodness
knows,
is
a
statutory
system
in
which
a
number
of
different
categories
fall
under
different
provisions.
so
that,
for
example,
bates
and
bowden
and
colby,
who
serve,
certainly,
more
nonresidents
than
they
do
residents,
don't...
are
not
subject
to
this
proviso
because
that
provision
of
the
statute
does
not
burden
with
this
proviso,
so
it's
only
this
section
which
deals
with
so-called
benevolent
and
charitable
organizations,
a
catchall,
but
does
identify
with
particularity
some
types,
camps,
nursing
homes,
boarding
homes,
and
mental
health
treatment
facilities
of
communities,
and
then
whatever
else
falls
within
the
catchall,
and
i've
got
to
get
the
answer
as
to
whether
hospitals
do
or
not.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
mental...
community
mental
treatment
centers,
so
it
would
not
be
a
mental
hospital.
but
take
a
nursing
home.
now,
nursing
homes,
obviously,
there
are
private,
there
are
profit-making
nursing
homes,
there
are
nonprofit
nursing
homes.
if
you're
on...
close
to
the
border
of
whatever
state
you're
close
to
the
border
of
and
you
serve
more
than
half...
now,
the
division
as
to
what
is
principally
and
what
is
not
has
not
been
made,
but
let's
say
it's
more
than
half
people
from
the
other
state,
you
lose
your
exemption,
and
you're
in
competition
with
those
other
nonprofit
nursing
homes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
no.
my
argument
would
be
the
same,
because
my
argument
has
to
do,
when
they're
getting
to
interstate
commerce,
you
can
approach
that
problem
in
different
ways,
as
i
indicate.
we
focused
on
the
impact
on
interstate
commerce
because
of
edwards
v.
california
and
a
long
line
of
cases
bringing
it
within
the
affirmative
and
the
dormant
commerce
clause
interstate
transportation
and
the
effect
of
statutes
on
it,
but
the
effect
would
be
there
anyway.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
yes.
well,
what
you
have
here
is
a
plain
incentive
to
these
organizations
to
limit
the
number
of
nonresidents
that
they
serve.
now,
they
can
do
that
in
order
to
get
the
tax
exemption
if
they're
close
to
the
edge.
they
can
do
it
by...
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
we're
not
close.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
not
without
a
massive
conversion
to
christian
science
in
the
state.
we're
in
great
difficulty,
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
it
is
not.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
all
right...
but
i
don't
want
to
leave
that,
because
i
think
the
statute
is
attacked
on
its
face,
and
surely
you
must
contemplate
in
judging
the
probable
impact
of
the
statute
situations
in
which
by
imposing
a
quota,
or
imposing
a
differential
fee
schedule,
a
camp,
or
a
nursing
home,
or
whatever,
could
qualify,
so--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--that's--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--no.
the
record
does
not
disclose...
the
record...
all
that
the
record
shows
is
that
there
are
some
camps
that
qualify
for
the
exemption
and
some
that
don't,
and
that's
all.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
absolutely,
without
any
question
in
my
judgment
that
is
perfectly
all
right,
and
indeed,
i
think
it
is
natural,
normal,
to
be
expected,
proper,
in
every
way
reasonable
for
a
state
to
say
we're
not
going
to
grant
a
charitable
property
tax
exemption
unless
this
charity
is
here,
doing
work
to
benefit
the
people
of
this
state.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right,
but
i'm
going
beyond
that,
beyond
the
chief
justice's
question,
in
saying
i
think
it's
also
proper
to
say
that
the
charity
must
perform
charitable
services
in
the
state.
now,
we
don't...
that
question
isn't
here.
this
camp
is
open
to
everybody
in
the
state
of
maine--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--that
could
well
be,
and
all
that
i'm
suggesting
is
that
a
requirement
that
a
charity
expend...
if
this
is
the
question--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--not
only
be
domiciled
there
but
spend
money
in
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
absolutely,
in
my
judgment.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
i...
i--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--would
be
unconstitutional?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
no.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
let
me
see
if
i
can...
this
is
a
question,
of
course,
i
considered
as
soon
as
i
started
on
this
case.
what
happens
to
a
state
that
wants
to
make
sure
that
a
charity
that
gets
an
exemption
does
something
for
the
people
of
the
state,
and...
excuse
me.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well,
it's
been
my
view,
and
there's
no
case
law
on
this
that
i
know
of,
but
it's
been
my
view
that
it
is
appropriate
and
proper
for
a
state
to
say
not
only
must
the
corporation
be
a
maine
corporation,
which
this
statute
does
require,
but
that
it's
got
to
do
something
in
the
state
of
maine.
now,
some
of
my
amicus
curiae
friends
would
not
agree
with
me
on
that
issue,
you
know,
i
think.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--complaining
about
the--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--well,
but
i
mean,
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
in
other
words,
we
are
suffering
a
financial
loss,
and
what
the
record
does
show
is
that
part
of
that
is
passed
on
to
the
campers
and
part
of
it
detracts
from
the
ability
of
the
camp
to
perform
certain
services.
that's
the
other
line
of
interstate
commerce
approach
to
this
problem
that
one
could
take.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
no,
but
if...
if
the
sales
tax
or
the
real
estate
tax
or
any
tax
is
imposed
upon
an
organization
because
it
serves
too
many
people
from
out
of
the
state...
a
hotel,
a
motel,
any
kind
of
a
service...
a
grocery
store.
because
it
serves
too
many
people
from
out
of
the
state,
that
involves
a
competitive
relationship
between
those
organizations
and
organizations
that
get
the
exemption
within
the
state,
and
that's
a
financial
burden
that
disadvantages
them.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well,
i'm--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--no,
but
just...
now,
that
point
has
been
made
by
the
law
court
that
we're
not
really
in
competition
with
anybody
else
because
we
serve
just
christian
scientists.
now,
that
argument
has,
it
seems
to
me,
a
rather
unfortunate
ring
to
it,
but
taking
that...
and
ignoring
that,
the
fact
is
that
other
camps
are
in
the
state
of
maine
and
they're
open
to
christian
scientists,
science
families,
so
that
we're
competing
for
that
group.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
justice
scalia,
nonprofits
are
nursing
homes...
just
looking
at
the
way
that
nursing
homes
operate,
or
any
kind
of
a
treatment
facility,
any
kind
of
nonprofits,
they
are
in
competition
for
contributions,
they
are
in
competition
to
build
up
their
staffs,
they're
in...
you've
got
the
evidence
of
their
competition
every
day
in
the
mails.
they
are
in
relation
one
to
the
other
in
competition,
and
they
are
affecting
interstate
commerce.
and
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
point
that
you
made,
justice
ginsburg,
without
noting
again
that
this
statute
is
being
attacked
on
its
face,
and
justice
o'connor,
the
question
you
raise
about
kind
of
a
graduated
subsidy
to
me
is
a
very
difficult
question.
i
will
just
say
that.
i
think
that
clearly
the
state
could
have
done
what
it
wanted
to
do
here
by
eliminating
the
tax
exemptions
and
providing
vouchers
to
the
citizens
of
the
state
to
use
however
they
want.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
well,
i--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
--exactly.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
exactly.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
argument.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
in
that
case,
with
each
citizen
armed
with
a
voucher
to
go
wherever,
there
would
be
no
incentive
on
the
part
of
any
camp
to
limit
its
service
to
non-state
people.
there
just
wouldn't,
that's
all,
so
that
aspect
of
the
case
just
disappears
in
the
context
of
a
voucher
system.
in
the
context
of
a
subsidy
system
that's
graduated
to
out-of-state
service,
then
you're
getting
to
the
edge,
it
seems
to
me,
of
where
the
court
has
been
moving
in
terms
of
validating
subsidies.
a
flat
subsidy
would
be
okay.
that
kind
of
a
subsidy
i
think
there's
a
question
about.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have
two
comments.
the...
one
of
the
questions
that
justice
scalia
raised
in
terms
of
how
old
this
statute
is
raises
another
question,
and
also
your
last
question
about
property
taxes,
and
that
is,
why
hasn't
this
court
ever
seen
a
case
like
this
before,
and
the
short
answer
is
that
legislatures
have
not
passed
statutes
like
this
before.
now,
there
have
been
scores,
thousands
of
statutes
that
we
don't
know
anything
about,
but
we
have
examined,
and
the
respondent
has,
the
statutes
on
the
books.
we
have
discovered
one
in
the
state
of
michigan
that
can
be
considered
comparable.
the
respondent
has
turned
up
three
more.
we
deny
that
they're
comparable.
but
in
any
case,
if
this
statute
is
not
absolutely
unique,
it
is
almost
unique,
and
that
says
something,
because
the
policy
of
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
have
to
do
just
with
economics,
it
has
to
do
with
interstate
comity,
and
we
suggest
that
this
unbroken,
almost
unbroken
pattern
of
behavior
by
the
legislatures
says
something
about
how
the
states
feel
to
meet
the
demands
of
interstate
comity.
now,
the
last
point
is
justice
connor's
comment
and
justice
scalia's
comment,
i
hope
it
goes
without
saying,
because
i
didn't
say
it,
that
our
case
is
rooted
in
the
basic
premise
that
this
statute
is
facially
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce.
justice
scalia,
i
think
you're
absolutely...
i
started
with
this
notion
in
the
petition
of
certiorari.
if
you
apply
all
the
ordinary
canons
that
this
court
has
established
over
the
years
dealing
with
these
cases,
the
other
side
has
got
to
lose,
in
my
judgment.
the
only
way
out
is
to
create
an
exception
for...
i
wouldn't
say
charities,
nonprofit
organizations
comparable
to
the
market
participation
or
the
subsidy
charity.
now,
we've
advanced
all
the
reasons
that
we
think
that
that
would
be
an
unwise
move
on
the
part
of
the
court,
but
that
really
i
think
is
the
issue.
mr.
chief
justice.
