well,
logically
there's...
it's
hard
to
see
a
difference
between
a
tax
exemption
and
a
direct
subsidy,
isn't
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
the
court
has
drawn
that
distinction.

but
you

the

has
treated

differently.

i
mean,
what
if
it
were
a
direct
subsidy
of
cash
to
a
maine
charity--
justice
sandra

o'connor
--based
on
how
many
maine
residents
were
served
by
the
charity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
be
all
right
for
maine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
looking
at
it,
what
test
do
we
apply?
it
appears
to
be
facially
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce,
so
it
may
be
a
tougher
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
you
concede
that
even
nonprofit
organizations
can
engage
in
interstate
commerce
you
can
certainly
look
at
this,
let's
say,
in
the
nursing
home
context
as
being
facially
discriminatory.
