mr.
william
l.
plouffe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
addressing
in
detail
the
three
arguments
in
my
brief
which
i
use
to
support
the
conclusion
or
the
results
achieved
by
the
maine
law
court,
i
want
to
address
two
fundamental
points
which
i
think
should
be
addressed
at
the
outset.
the
first
one
is
that
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
right
for
a
nonprofit
organization
to
receive
a
tax
exemption
from
local
property
taxes.
the
second
fundamental
point
is
that
state
legislatures
have
great
latitude
in
deciding
who
should
be
tax
exempt
and
who
should
not
be
tax
exempt.
this
is
especially
true,
i
believe,
when
we
are
talking
about
taxation
from
real
estate
tax,
or
exemption
from
real
estate
taxes
which
really
are
a
quintessentially
local
matter.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
that
discretion
of
state
legislatures
extends
to
being
able
to
determine
what
benefit
maine
residents
in
this
case
are
to
achieve...
are
to
receive
in
return
for
this
tax
exemption.
in
response
to
the
amici
in
this
case,
who,
from
reading
their
briefs--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--fundamentally,
justice
scalia,
that
is
one
of
my
arguments,
that
this
is
like
the
market
participant
exemption
in
hughes
v.
alexandria'
scrap
and
the
massachusetts
council
case
involving
the
city
of
boston.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
justice
breyer,
this
is--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--this
actually
is
quite
unlike
that
kind
of
a
subsidy
or--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--i
don't
think
so
when
we're
talking
about
exemptions
for
charities,
and
the
reasons
are
these.
first,
what
is
being
returned
by
the
charity
to
the
people
are
in
the
nature
of
governmental
services,
services
that
the
government
otherwise
would
provide.
feeding
the
hungry,
sheltering
the
homeless.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
the--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--well,
the
second
distinction
is
that
the
other
exemptions
that
are
addressed
by
this
court...
for
example,
in
west
lynn
creamery,
there
were
two
problems
with
that.
one,
it
was
intended
to
give
a
competitive
advantage.
there
really
is
no
competitive
advantage
here,
and
secondly,
the
tax
that
was
collected--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--well,
of
course,
the
fundamental
discrimination
that
we
draw
is
between
for-profit
camps
and
nonprofit
camps
that
receive
an
exemption.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
there's
also
competition
there,
justice
stevens,
and--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--well,
part
of
the
answer
i
think
is,
what
is
the
competition?
is
it
to
dispense
more
charity,
to
feed
more
homeless...
more
homeless
people,
or
to
shelter
more
homeless
people?
i
really
don't
look
at
that
in
terms
of
competition.
in
a
case
like,
situation
like
this,
one
camp--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--of
course,
universities
in
maine
are
under
a
separate
section
of
the
statute
and
this
provision
we're
talking
about
which,
primarily,
benefits
doesn't
apply
to
them.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
if
the
state
legislature
were
to
so
determine.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
well,
we
haven't
done
that.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
it's
legislative
discretion.
could
a
legislature
do
it,
and
to
the
amici
i
would
say,
legislators
could
choose
to
tax
colleges
and
universities.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
they
could
do
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
tax
exemption.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
ah.
that's
the
walz
question,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
and
i
would
like
to
address
the
walz
question
because
that
has
been
brought
up
in
the
reply
brief.
the...
justice
burger's
opinion
in
walz,
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
in
walz
specifically
avoided
focusing
on
the
secular
good
works
that
churches
do
as
the
rationale
for
granting
them
an
exemption.
he
focused
rather
upon
the
history
of
how
we
have
treated
churches
and
religious
organizations
in
this
country
since
its
founding,
and
before
that,
how
england
treated
them,
and
he
also
focused
upon
wanting
to
avoid
the
entanglement
between
government
and
the
churches
that
could
come
about.
if
we
did
tax
them
and
they
didn't
pay
their
taxes,
we
might
have
to
foreclose
on
their
property.
justice
douglas,
dissenting,
to
another
view.
he
said,
this
is
over
some
secular
good
works.
to
get
to
the
issue
made
in
the...
by
the
camps,
or
the
petitioner
in
their
brief,
this
court
actually,
i
think,
dealt
with
the
problem
that
is
raised
by
the
subsidy
to
the
churches
in
regan
v.
taxation
with
representation,
when
then
justice
rehnquist,
now
chief
justice
rehnquist,
wrote
that
in
fact
exemptions...
this
was
under
a
case
involving
a
501(c)(3)
exemption,
and
the
petitioner
felt
that
they
were
being
discriminated
against
because
they
engaged
in
lobbying
activities,
and
under
501(c)(3)
could
not
be
granted
that
status
so
contributions
to
the
petitioner
were
not
tax
deductible.
and
chief
justice
rehnquist
wrote
first
that
the
exemption
is
really
the
equivalent
of
a
subsidy
or
even
a
cash
grant...
those
are
the
words
that
were
used,
cash
grant...
and
that
really
the
government
has
no
obligation
to
subsidize
the
first
amendment
activities
in
that
case
of
the
petitioner.
and
in
a
footnote,
the
chief
justice
acknowledged
walz,
and
did
not
find
it
to
be
at
variance
with
this
case
with
regan,
where
they
were
dealing
with
clearly
secular
matters,
so
i
think
the
court
has
addressed
the
problem
that
has
been
brought
up
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
justice
ginsburg,
the
statute
says
principally
benefits,
and
throughout
the
course
of
this
litigation
we
have
treated
this
as
being
51
percent.
with
respect
to
the
other
sections
of
the
statute
that
have
been
raised,
if
i
could
take
this
opportunity
to
do
that,
hospitals
are...
hospitals
licensed
by
the
maine
department
of
human
services
are
in
a
separate
section
of
the
statute
that
doesn't
apply.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
that
would
be
up
to
the
local
assessor,
who
acts
as
an
agent
of
the
state,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
50-50
meets
the
test
of
principally--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--that--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--that
would
be
true
if...
if
the
nonexempt
entity
chose
to
be
insular,
not
to
provide
any
other
services
to
the
surrounding
people,
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case.
if
the
statute--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--let
me
answer
your
question
directly.
under...
if
that
is
all
that
camp
did
in
terms
of
dispensing
charity,
then
the
answer
is
yes,
it
would
not
get
the
tax
exemption
and
the
other
camp
would,
even
though
they
both
serve
the
blind.
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is,
when
read
carefully,
this
statute
doesn't
focus
on
the
residency
of
the
campers,
or
in
your
hypothetical
the
residency
of
the
blind
people.
the
statute
focuses
on
how
the
charity
spends
its
money,
and
certainly
in
the
case
of
the
summer
camp
they're
usually
going
to
spend
their
money
just
on
the
kids
who
pay
the
money,
the
tuition
money,
but
they
could
choose
to
do
things
like
open
their
beautiful
beach
to
the
people
of
harrison,
and
that
would
be
a
benefit
to
maine
people
that
could
be
included
in
the
computation
of,
do
they
principally
benefit
maine
people,
but
they
don't
do
that.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
a
camp,
because
they
would
already
be
serving
maine
people--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--there's
discrimination
drawn,
justice
kennedy,
based
on
the
benefit
to
maine
people
or
no
benefit
to
maine
people--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--the
provision
that
we
are
arguing
about--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--the
provision
that
we're
arguing
about
was
enacted
in
1957.
it
was
upheld
by
the
maine
supreme
court
in
1963,
in
a
case
that
was
decided
on
fourteenth
amendment
ground,
in
which
the
law
court
said,
we
don't
think
that
it's
irrational
or
unreasonable
for
the
state
of
maine...
and
this
is
peculiar
to
charities...
for
the
state
of
maine
to
require
that
its
people
get
something
in
return...
in
return
for
this
forgiveness
of
taxes,
and
that
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
case.
this
court,
when
it
visited
this
issue
before
in
whyy,
inc.,
a
similar
issue,
only
that
one
was
the
state
of
incorporation
of
the
charity,
used
a
fourteenth
amendment
analysis,
and
there
was
dicta
in
whyy,
inc.
to
suggest...
and
i
admit
that
it
is
only
dicta...
to
suggest
that,
had
the
facts
been
as
they
are
here
today,
that
may
have
been
okay
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
petitioner
raised
the
fourteenth
amendment
claims
in
this
case
below,
and
the
law
court
ruled
against
the
petitioner,
so
did
the
superior
court,
and
they
chose
not
to
appeal
that
fourteenth
amendment
decision
to
this
court,
apparently
agreeing
that
the
statute
does
pass
the
fourteenth
amendment
test.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
understand,
your
honor,
that
the
court
can
and
in
this
case
is
looking
at
this
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
if
we
choose
not
to
use
something
like
the
market
participant
exception,
and
therefore
apply
the
dormant
commerce
clause
to
it,
then
the
question
is,
is
it,
per
se,
a
flexible
approach,
and
the
law
court
chose
the
flexible
approach.
looking
at
the
per
se
question,
i
think
there
are
three
things
we
need
to
look
at:
the
statute,
the
statutory
language,
and
then
if
it
survives
that,
the
effects
of
the
statute,
actual
effects,
and
incurred
effects.
and
the
statute
itself,
as
i
said
before,
i
think
focuses
on
the
benefits
that
are
provided
by
the
corporation
and
not
by
the--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
o'connor.
on
its
face
it's
a
tax,
or
an
exemption
from
a
tax
on
real
estate,
number
one.
we've
never
considered
real
estate
under
the
commerce
clause
here
before.
number
2,
it
looks
at
the
identity
of
the
people
who
are
benefited,
not
the
identity
of
the
people
who
cross
the
state
lines.
and
so
i
don't
think
that
there
is
facial
discrimination.
and
number
3,
as
the
law
court
said,
it
treats
all
maine
camps
the
same.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
there's
the
target.
you
can
go
out
and
meet
the
target
if
you
want
the
exemption.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
the
christian
science
church
in
boston,
for
example,
the
church
is
actually
owned
by
a
separate
maine
corporation.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
well,
again,
i
think
that
under
walz
churches
are
treated
differently
by
the
court.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
we
have
a
nonprofit
maine
corporation
that
is
not
itself
a
church.
churches
are
treated
differently
under
the
maine
statute--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--and
the
50
percent
just
doesn't
apply.
it's
a
nonprofit
maine
corporation.
they
have
an
affiliation
somehow,
and
i'm
not
exactly
sure
how,
with
the
christian
science
church
that
do
allow
only
christian
science
children
in,
and
i
believe
that
at
some
point
during
the
day
they
review
the
tenets
of
the
christian
science
faith,
but
it
is
not
a
church.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
think
i
have
a
couple
of
responses
to
that,
justice
stevens.
one,
i
think
it
would
fail
fourteenth
amendment
analysis.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--and
would
have
under
green
acre
b'hai,
which
is
the
main
case.
under
the
commerce
clause,
i
suggest
that
because
it
is
a...
the
implications
of
it
being
exempted
from
a
tax
of
real
estate
is
that
it
would
fall
under
the
flexible
approach,
but
would
fail
under
the
flexible
approach
because
there
would
be
no
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
survive.
just--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--i
don't
think
it
would.
maybe
the
charity
is
becoming
involved
in
my
thinking,
but--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--i...
again,
if
it's
real
estate,
then
i
don't
think
it's
facial,
that
it's
an
indirect
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
and
because
it's
indirect,
you
look
at
it
under
the
flexible
approach,
but
i
think
it
would
fail
under
the
flexible
approach
because
it
would
not...
i
can't
conceive
of
a
legitimate
state
interest,
for
example,
in
the
motel
situation
that's
raised
in
the
reply
brief.
i
can't
think
of
a
legitimate
state
interest
for
taxing
a
motel--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--and
again,
under
regan...
regan,
i'm
sorry...
this
court
has
clearly
characterized
charitable
exemptions
as
cash
grant
subsidies.
the
amici
here
say
they're
subsidies,
and
they
are
from
the
general
fund
of
the
town
of
harrison.
this
tax
goes
into
the
general
fund
to
pay
for
municipal
services,
police
protection,
fire
protection,
roads,
and
the
very
services
that
ironically
benefit
the
petitioner,
yet
they
don't
want
to
pay
the
tax.
but
the
point
of
the
general
fund
is
the
language
in
west
lynn
creamery
seemed
to
be
very
interested
in
the
fact
that
any
subsidy
had
to
come
out
of
a
general
fund.
this
is
a
broad-based
tax.
all
of
the
people
in
the
town
of
harrison
have
to
pay
this
tax.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
think
because
we're
talking
about
real
estate,
and
we
have
never
applied
the
commerce
clause
to
the
taxation
of
real
estate
which
doesn't
move
across
state
lines,
that
effects
that
a
tax
on
real
estate,
or
an
exemption
from
a
tax
on
real
estate
have
on
interstate
commerce
are
indirect.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
well,
the
language
of
the
positive
commerce
clause--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--perhaps
i
have
a
narrow
view
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
but--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--we
are,
but
the
question
becomes,
is
it
per
se
a
flexible
one.
i'm
saying
there
isn't
a...
there
could
be
in
the
hypothetical
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but
that
it
would
be
indirect
and
not
subject
to
the
per
se
rule,
and
i
would
also
add
that--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--well,
i
think
that
the
tax
on
real
estate
may
or
may
not
be
incorporated
into
the
charge
made
by
the
for-profit
organization.
there
are
other
ways
that
they
could
handle
that.
if
the
competitive
marketplace
said,
gee,
we
just
can't
pass
on
this
tax
and
stay
in
business,
we'll
find
other
ways
to
deal
with
this
in
the
marketplace,
for
example,
reducing
staff,
or
reducing
overhead,
those
types
of
things,
it's
very
indirect
before
it
gets
to
the
consumer.
and
the
other
issue
about
the
hypothetical
is
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
treat
consumers
as
articles
of
commerce.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
well,
they...
i
think
they
did
in
their
first
brief.
let's
put
that
aside.
they
certainly
do
make
it
in--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--they
certainly
have
not
abandoned
the
attempt
to
say
that
the
travel
of
these
campers
across
state
lines
is
protected
by
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
certainly
am
attesting
that...
challenging
that.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
don't
read
heart
of
atlanta
or
edwards
for
the
proposition
put
forth
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
william
l.

i
think
the
provision
of
interstate
travel
by
bus
companies,
for
example,
does.
i
think
that
salesmen
who
travel
across--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--but
we're
not
taxing
the
plane
or
the
bus
or
the
train.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
and
i'm
suggesting
that
it
would
be
an
indirect
effect
and
subject
to
the
flexible
approach,
but
i
still
do
not
read
those
two
cases
for
the
proposition
for
which
they
want
them
to
stand.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
my
argument
goes
so
far
as
to
cover
an
exemption
from
income
taxes,
which
was
the
case
in
regan,
federal
income
taxes,
excise
taxes,
if
they
would
pay...
having
occasion
to
pay
them,
and
sales
taxes.
we
exempt
them
from
sales
taxes
and
income
taxes
and
property
taxes
in
the
state
of
maine,
and
if
they
are
going
to
challenge
the
impact,
how
the
lines
are
drawn
by
the
legislature
in
granting
those
exemptions,
then
my
argument
would
say--
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
--that
it's
under
market
participation,
because
in
each
one
of
those
cases
the
state
is
asking
something
in
return.
we
may
think
that
it's
provincialism
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
maine
to
write
its
statute
this
way,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
legislature
in
maine
can
do
this.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
have
found
none,
your
honor.
i...
the
whyy
case
is
as
close
as
i
could
come.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
have
great
difficulty
considering
the
attraction
of
parishioners
as
commerce.
mr.
william
l.
plouffe
i
would
say
that
whyy
in
this
court
did
strike
down
the
distinction
based
on
the
domicile
of
the
corporation,
and
that
was
a
real
estate
tax,
and
that
was
a
charity,
but
it
was
determined
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
commerce
clause
was
not
mentioned
at
all.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
