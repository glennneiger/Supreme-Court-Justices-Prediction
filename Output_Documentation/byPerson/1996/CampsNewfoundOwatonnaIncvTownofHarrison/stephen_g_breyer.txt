so
it's
like,
for
example,
we
give
a
special
exemption
to
our
farmers,
only
to
our
local
farmers
because
they
keep
the
land
green
and
they
in
addition
provide
employment,
and
they
maintain
the
state
as
primarily
agricultural.
i
mean,
is
that
a
justification--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
discriminating
against
out-of-state
farmers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that.
my
question
really
is,
if
we're
going
to
start
looking
to
local
benefits
as
a
basis
for
discriminating
against
out-of-state
travel
or
commerce,
what
road
are
we
going
down?
doesn't
that
erode
most
of
the
court's
jurisprudence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
means,
then,
that
in
fact
the
hungry
in
other
states,
the
children
who
want
to
travel
to
the
local
hospital
across
state
lines,
the
people
who
want
to
travel
across
state
lines
to
get
an
education,
all
of
the
different
people
out
of
state
that
want
to
use
commerce
to
take
advantage
in-state...
you
see,
i'm
saying,
so?
