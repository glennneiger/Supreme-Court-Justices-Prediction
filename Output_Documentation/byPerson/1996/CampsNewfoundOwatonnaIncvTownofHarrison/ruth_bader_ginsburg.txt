that's
because
the
tax
goes
to
the
county,
not
the
state,
this
real
property
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
tax...
the
tax
in
this
case
was
the
town's
tax--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
was
authorized
by
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
while
you
were
outlining
the,
is
it
like
a
subsidy,
is
it
like
a
participant
in
the
market,
it's...
is
it
at
all
relevant
that
real
estate...
taxes
on
real
estate
go
back
a
pretty
long
way,
and
i
thought
that
the
original...
that
that
thought
had
little
to
do
with
commerce,
but
had
to
do
very
much
with
the
public
service
that
the
charity,
or
most
traditionally
the
church,
was
supplying
for
the
local
community.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
not
some
notion
of
worldwide
benefit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
to...
whether
this...
we
can
say
real
estate
taxes
originate...
exemptions
from
real
estate
taxes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
don't
tax
the
church
property...
from
something
that
had
to
do
with
benefiting
locals,
and
that's
why
we...
that's
why
these
exemptions
from
the
real
estate...
real
estate
doesn't
move
from
one
state
to
another
like
lumber
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
something
special
about
real
estate
where
an
exemption
from
the
tax
might
be
supportable
in
that
area
and
not
in
others?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
applies
only
to
when
they're
serving
out-of-state
people,
and
it's
$30.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
fifty
thousand,
which
might
not
be
the
lion's
share
of
the
tax
anyway,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
depends
on
what
is
the
value
of
the
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that's
true--
--if
it
were
pro
rata,
would
you
have
the
same...
would
you
have
a
constitutional
objection?
suppose
it
said
to
the
extent
that
you
serve
people
from
out
of
state
you
don't
get
the
exemption,
but
to
the
extent
that
you
serve,
so
in
your
case
you
could
get
5
percent
exemption
because
you
have
5
percent
from
in-state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
the
effect,
the
harm
that
you're
complaining
about?
can
you
be
precise
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
camp
isn't
even
within
that
range.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
you
describe
some
things,
this
will
give
camps
like
yours
an
incentive
to
take
people
only
from
in
the
state,
but
it's...
your
camp
can't
operate...
that's
not
what
it
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
going
to
have
that
impact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
impact
that
you
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know,
in
fact,
that
there
is
any
such
camp
in
the
entire
state
of
maine--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
there
would
be
that...
they
say,
gee,
we're
pretty
close
to
the
50
percent
mark
so
we
have
to
serve
in-state
people
not
out-of-state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
a
different
question
than,
you
can
be
domiciled
in
the
state,
have
all
of
your
operations
in
the
state,
but
everybody
you
serve
is
from
out
of
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
chief's
question...
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dempsey--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
the
chief's
question
was,
suppose
the
maine
law
was,
charities
who
are
domiciled
in
this
state
are
exempt
from
real
property
taxes
in
this
state.
i
thought
you
answered
that
that
would...
you
gave
an
unequivocal,
that
would
be
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what...
so
let's
take
a
charity
situated
in
maine,
operating
only
in
maine--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
serving
only
children
from
india.
your
answer
is
that
that
would
get--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
would
be
constitutional.
i
mean,
there
would
be
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
sorry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
serves
only
people
from
out
of
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
wouldn't
be
any
complainant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
get
back
to
the
question
of
how
people
situated
as
your
client
is,
how
they're
harmed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
we've
already
established
that
at
least
for
this
category
of
camp
they're
not
going
to
change
the
composition
of
the
people
who
come
to
them,
and
we
don't
know
whether
any
such
entities
that
would
decide
to
take--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
just
don't
know
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
is...
what
other
harm
are
you
complaining
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
can't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
you're
just
complaining
about,
there's
this
tax
and
you
don't
like
to
pay
it,
suppose
maine
has
a
higher
sales
tax
than
other
states,
and
it
could
cost
you
more
to
operate
in
maine
because
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
competing
with
charities
that
serve
maine
people.
that's
not...
i
don't
see
the
competitive
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you
just
started
out
by
saying,
no,
we
wouldn't
change...
our
camp
is
for
christian
scientists
from
all
over
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
plouffe,
what
is
the
cut
off
for
being...
serving...
for
qualifying
for
this
exemption?
you
have
to
serve
dominantly
maine
residents,
but
what
is
it,
50
percent?
what
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
stay
where
the
division
is,
because
do
i
understand
the
statute
to
work
this
way:
we
have
two
camps,
say,
for
the
blind.
one
serves
50
residents
of
maine
and
it's
exempt
from
this
tax.
the
other
serves
50
residents
of
maine
and
50
residents
from
elsewhere
in
the
united
states.
it
doesn't
get
the
exemption,
yet
it's
providing
the
same
services.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
make
it
60-40
so
we
won't
run
into
that
problem,
40
percent
from
maine,
60
percent
from
outside.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
exemption
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
i...
it's
a
camp
for
the
blind,
and
it
serves
the
same
number
of
maine
people
as
the
camp
that
serves
only
maine
people,
but
it's
a
larger
camp
so
it
also
takes
in
a
lot
of
people
from
out
of
state,
so
it's
rendering
exactly
the
same
benefits
to
the
state
of
maine,
but
it's
also
including
these
other
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
broadly
do
you
take
charities
outside
the
dormant
commerce
clause?
i
know
your
position
here
is
that
charitable
exemptions,
real
property
tax
exemptions
shouldn't
be
analyzed
in
interstate
commerce,
and
you've
given
several
reasons
for
that,
but
are
you
saying
that
nonprofits
and
whatever
exemptions
the
legislature,
state
legislature
chooses
to
give
to
them
is
ever
and
always,
because
they're
nonprofits
it
falls
outside
the
range
of
the
commerce
clause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we--
