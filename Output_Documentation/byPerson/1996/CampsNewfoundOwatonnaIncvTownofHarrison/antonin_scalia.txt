why
should
the
taxpayers
of
maine
subsidize
charity
to
people
outside
of
maine?
i
don't
know
why
they
should
be
compelled
to
do
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
the
commerce
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
those
other
cases...
those
other
cases
don't
involve
as
proximately
as
this
one
does
the...
in
effect
the
expenditure
of
state
money.
it
seems
to
me
that
this...
that
is,
the
granting
of
a
tax
deduction
to
charities,
it's
just
like
giving
charities
the
state
money.
i
don't
know
that
those
other
states
involve...
those
other
cases
involve
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
this
is
closer
to
the
situation
in
which
the
state
is
a
market
participant,
and
the
state
chooses
to
purchase
its
goods
only
from
in-state
companies.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
it's
entitled
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
it's
limited
to
charity.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
can
decide
that
there's
been
discrimination
against
out-of-state
commerce,
you
have
to
decide
that
you're
dealing
with
two
taxpayers
who
are
similarly
situated,
and
why
isn't
it
entirely
reasonable
to
say
that
they
are
not
similarly
situated
where
a
charitable...
where
this
deduction
is
at
issue
where
one
of
the
taxpayer
provides
charity
to
the
citizens
of
maine--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
other
one
does
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
are
they
similarly
situated?
i
don't
think
you
can
run
that
argument
in
the
normal
commercial
case
where
all
you
can
say
is
that
one
is
an
outlander,
the
other
one
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here
one
is
giving
something--
justice
antonin
scalia
--gratis
to
the
citizens
of
maine.
why
doesn't
that
make
that
taxpayer
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
argument
is
that
the
state
is
a
market
participant.
i
was
just
arguing
that
by
analogy
to
the
reason
we
think
market
participation
is
okay--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
can
discriminate
against
your
out-of-state
citizens
when
you're
a
market
participant--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
also
you
can
do
it
in
this
situation,
where
you're
dealing
with
someone
who
is
providing
a...
you
know,
a
service
gratis--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
too
far
down
that
road--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
i
understand
this
law,
it
doesn't
apply
to
all
nonprofits.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
applies
to
only
those...
they
have
to
sell
their
services
for
no
more
than
$30
a
week,
isn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
know
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
they
lose
the
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
do
you
know
anybody
that
can
possibly
run
a
camp
for
$30
a
week
without
giving
a
lot
of
that
away
for
free?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
not
just
talking
about
"nonprofits",
you're
talking
in
every
case
under
this
law
about
companies
who
are
giving
away
stuff
free
to
residents
of
maine.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
and
the
$30
applies
only
to
out-of-staters?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
glad
you
clarified
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
really
are
talking--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
about
charitable
organizations.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why?
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that
at
all.
i
mean,
you
can
be
there
without
doing
work
to
benefit
the
people
of
the
state.
your
domicile
can
be
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
all
of
your
charity
can
be
expended
in
bangladesh.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
complaining
about
the
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
out
of
pocket,
i
suppose
is
your
big
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
competing
to
give
away
money,
not
to
make
a
profit.
it's
unreal
to
talk
about
competing
to
give
away
money.
i
can
give
away
more
money
than
you
can.
are
you
hurt
if
someone
else
gives
away
more
money
than
you're
giving
away?
i
don't
understand
that.
that
is
not
competition
to
my
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
do
it
by
saying
every
organization,
that
every
charitable
organization
that
serves
the
citizens
of
this
state
gets
a
$1
deduction
from
its
income
tax
each
time
it
serves
a
citizen
of
the
state?
could
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
could.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
asserting
that,
unlike
other
tax
exemptions,
this
is
a
quid
pro
quo
type
of
tax
exemption.
they're
giving
this
one
because
the
state
is
getting
something
gratis
from
these
organizations,
and
that
distinguishes
it
from
other
tax
exemptions.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
weekend
canoeing
at
camp
okefenokee.
i
don't
know
that
a
state
would
provide
that
if
a
charity
wouldn't
provide
it.
don't
those
people
use
commerce?
aren't
they
discriminated
against
just
like
the
out-of-state
farmer?
what
actually
is
the
distinction
that
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
it's
a
charity?
justice
antonin
scalia
actually,
you
dispense
more
charity
by
losing
more
money,
i
assume.
well,
of
course
there
are
universities
which
are
charitable
in
some
respects,
anyway,
and
they
say
that
each
education
they
give
out
costs
more
than
the
student
pays.
nonetheless,
they
compete
for
students.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
so
scary.
i
mean,
the
legislatures
right
now,
no
matter
how
we
come
out
on
this
case,
could
simply
eliminate
the
tax
deduction
for
public...
for
private
universities
and
choose
to
subsidize,
give
some
of
the
in-state
tax
money
to
those
in-state
universities
that
have
a
majority
of
in-state
students.
they
can
do
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
horrible
can
come
about
no
matter
how
we
come
out
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
long
has
this
law
been
in
effect?
it
seems
to
me
it's
more
trouble
than
it's
worth.
my
goodness.
[laughter]
computing...
how
do
you
value
the
use
of
a
beach,
for
example?
has
this
thing
been
around
a
long
time?
i
mean,
i
see
endless
litigation
over
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we
should
strike
it
down
for
foolishness
or
something.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
would
never
think
of
accusing
the
state
of
maine
of
provincialism.
[laughter]
the...
do
you
know
of
any
case
of
ours
that
involves
a
commerce
clause
challenge
to
real
estate
taxes?
what
cases
of
ours...
or
exemptions
to
real
estate
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
interesting.
does
it
produce
a
sort
of
discrimination
against
out-of-state...
an
out-of-state
church,
for
example,
to
give
a
tax
exemption
to
any
church
that
owns
real
estate,
they're
exempt
from
the
real
estate
tax,
but
if
you're
an
out-of-state
church,
of
course,
and
happen
to
be
located
in
a
state
that
taxes
church
real
estate,
you're
at
a
commercial
disadvantage,
i
suppose,
if
you
consider
the
attracting
of
parishioners
as
commerce.
