justice

--yes.
can
you
tell
me,
what
is
the
philosophy
that
allows
you
to
concede,
in
the
voucher
hypothetical,
there
would
be
no
commerce
clause
violation?
what
is
the
basis
for
the
distinction
between
that
case
and
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
a
camp
that
served
just
maine
residents
would
not
have
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
right
back
to
where
you
started.
there's
a
discrimination
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
campers.
