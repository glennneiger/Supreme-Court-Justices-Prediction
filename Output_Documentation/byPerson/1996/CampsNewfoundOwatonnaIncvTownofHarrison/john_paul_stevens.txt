john

stevens
would
a
hospital
lose
its
exemption
if
it
took
a
lot
of
out-of-state
patients?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
you've
given
me
the
answer
for
a
mental
institution.
if
they
took
too
many
out-of-state
patients
they
would
lose--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
there
no
competitive
advantage?
suppose
they
get
an
identical
camp
that
just
has
95
percent
of
its
residents
are
children
from
maine.
why
isn't
there
a
competitive
advantage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me...
i
just
want
to
challenge
you
on
your
no
competitive
advantage.
you
have
two
nonprofit
camps.
one
has
55
percent
maine
children
there,
and
one
has
35
percent
maine.
doesn't
one
have
a
competitive
advantage
if
it
gets
an
exemption
and
the
other
does
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
couldn't
give
the
subsidy
to
a
church
camp,
could
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
the
people
benefited
do
not
include
the
church
that
runs
the
camp?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say...
you
look
at
the
people
benefited,
and
i
just
suggest
one
of
the
people
benefited
would
be
whatever
the
charity
it
is
that
gets
the
benefit
of
an
exemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
supposing
it...
just
focus
on
the
church
for
a
minute.
supposing
the
church
is
near
the
state
line
and
over
half
the
people
came
from
out
of
state,
would
the
church...
would
you
say
that
the
church
should
not
get
its
exemption
because
the
people
benefiting
from
the
exemption
are
the
people
that
cross
state
lines?
it
seems
to
me
the
principal
beneficiary
of
the
exemption
is
the
church
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
have
a
church
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
a
religious
organization
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
let
me
ask
one
other...
you
place
so
much
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
it's
a
real
estate
tax.
if
it
were
not
a
charity,
you
would
not
contend,
i
do
not
suppose,
that
in
a
commercial
context
that
the
state
could
discriminate...
have
a
tax
exemption
for
businesses
that
sold
only
to
maine
customers
and
no
tax
exemption
for
those
that
sold
out-of-state
customers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
under...
just
confine
our
analysis
to
the
commerce
clause--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
the
interest
would
be
to
encourage
local
commerce,
encourage
transactions
within
the
state,
encourage
the
local
economy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
there
were
two
camps,
not
charitable
camps
but
just
for-profit
camps.
one
served
out-of-state,
and
the
other
served
local,
and
they
say,
we
won't...
we'll
give
a
tax
exemption
to
those
serving
the
local
people.
would
that
have
the
same
justification
as
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure
it
would.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
charity
is
critical
to
your
argument,
and
you
seem
to...
and
i
don't
think
your
real
estate
argument
can
stand
without
coupling
it
with
your
charitable
argument,
but
i'm
not
sure
what
your
position
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
providing
cheaper
housing
for
local
residents.
give
them
a
cheaper
rate
at
the
hotels,
if
people
have
marginal
income.
there's
certainly
a
state
interest
in
having
people
sleep
indoors
at
night.
of
course,
you
could
make
all
of
those
same
arguments
against
the
market
participation
exception
we've
created.
you
can
say
it's
the
same
thing.
the
state
is
simply
trying
to
give
its
own
citizens
an
advantage
over
out-of-state.
we've
made
an
exception
there,
and
we've
made
an
exception
in
the
subsidy
area,
and
the
issue
is
whether
we
should
make
an
exception
for
charities,
whether
that
also
is
a
distinctive
situation.
