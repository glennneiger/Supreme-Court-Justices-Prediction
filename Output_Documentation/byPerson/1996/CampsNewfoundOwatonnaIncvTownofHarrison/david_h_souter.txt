justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
answer
to
that
that
it's
purchasing
a
great
number
of
other
things,
too,
and
for
that
reason
it
doesn't
fall
afoul...
i
mean,
it's
purchasing
all
sorts
of
secular
benefits
on
the
same
ground
for
that
reason
it
doesn't
fall
afoul
of
establishment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
i
understand,
your
argument
is,
even
if
you
lose
on
this
point
about
the
parity
of
competition,
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
essentially
the
same,
because
you
say,
number
1
you
can't
draw
a
charitable
versus
for-profit
distinction
because
in
fact
they
are
both
businesses
in
a
given
place,
and
number
2,
even
apart
from
competition,
you
are
discouraging
interstate
activity.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
the
essence--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they're
competing.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
they
can
be
under
this
section
of
the
statute
if
you
win
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
if
you
win
this
case,
the
state
legislature,
or
whoever
makes
these
decisions
in
maine,
can
say,
bates,
colby,
et
cetera,
are
all
going
to
be
fully
taxed
if
they
have
this
high
proportion
of
out-of-staters,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
can,
can't
you,
if
you
win
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
you...
we
accept
the
fact
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
a
much
more
lenient
standard
of
review
on
these
matters
of
economic
regulation
than
the
commerce
clause.
i
mean,
that's
a
given
under
our
jurisprudence
today.
that's
why
the
other
darnell
case
got
over...
in
effect
overruled
or
rewritten
in
the
carolina
tax
case
last
year.
i
mean,
the
standards
are
distinctly
different,
so
the
fact
that
you
may
pass
muster
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
get
you
over
the
line
on
the
commerce
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
plouffe,
could
you...
going
back
to
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
could
you
explain
to
me
why
it
is
in
the
case
of
the
two
profit-making
corporations
as
to
which
a
distinction
is
made
the
discrimination
would
not
have
been
facial?
you
said
it
would
not
have
been.
you
said
it
would
get
the,
as
you
put
it,
the
flexible
approach,
and
i
don't
see
why.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
the
fact
that
real
estate
doesn't
move
across
state
lines?
why
is
that
significant?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
interstate
commerce
is
going
to
be
affected
whether
you're
doing
it
through
a
real
estate
tax
or
any
other
form
of
taxation.
why
should
it
matter
that
the
specific
race
that
is
taxed
happens
to
be
itself
nonambulatory?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce
that
we're
concerned
with?
justice
david
h.
souter
directness
and
indirectness
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it's
real
estate
that's
being
taxed,
number
1,
and
number
2,
i
don't
know
where
the
direct-indirect
distinction
comes
from.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
nobody
is
arguing
that
you're
going
to
treat
consumers
as
articles
of
commerce.
the
argument
is
that
interstate
commerce...
that
is
to
say,
the
movement
of
people
back
and
forth,
the
provision
of
services
to
people
from
out
of
the
taxing
state...
is
going
to
be
affected.
their
argument
isn't...
they
don't
make
the
argument
that
the
campers
are
articles
of
interstate
commerce.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
escaped
me,
but
it's
clear
in
any
event
that
they
have
abandoned
any
such
attempt
if
they
ever
made
it,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
are
you
challenging
that
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
interstate
travel
is
not
protected
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
that
interstate
travel
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
these
campers
perhaps
arrive
in
maine
by
bus,
or
by
plane,
or
by
train,
or
some
such
means?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we're
asking
whether
interstate
commerce
is
affected,
and
if
it's
affected
by
bus
travel,
then
i
suppose
this
is
a
case
in
which
it's
affected.
