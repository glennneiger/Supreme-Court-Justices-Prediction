h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-897,
francis
bernard
auer
v.
david
robbins.
mr.
leibig,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
eighth
circuit,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
said
that
a
one-time
suspension
without
pay
for
violating
the
city's
residence
requirement
doesn't
mean
that
the
whole
thing
is
over.
now,
do
you
disagree
with
that
ruling?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
evidence
in
the
record
of
actual
discipline,
other
than
this
one
sergeant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i...
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
i
asked
you
what
evidence
is
there
in
the
record
of
actual
discipline,
not
whether
someone
was
subject
to
discipline.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
find
the...
didn't
find
for
you
as
a
fact
on
that
point--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
just
asking
for
a
factual
revision,
then,
from
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
eighth
circuit
saw
it
one
way,
and
you're
asking
us--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
see
it
a
different
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
an
important
factor
in
deciding
whether
you
were
subject
to
deduction
to
know
whether
actual
deductions
occurred,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
liebig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government's
position
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
renick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
renick.
the
case
is
submitted.
