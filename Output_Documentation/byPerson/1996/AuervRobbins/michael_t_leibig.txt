mr.
michael
t.
leibig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
application
of
a
rule
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
dealing
with
the
salary
basis
test.
the
rule
is
contained
in
29
c.f.r.
541.5d
and
541.118.
the
rule
basically
provides
that
for
persons
to
be
considered
white
collar
exempt...
that
is,
professional
exempt
adminis...
professionals,
administrators,
exempt
administrators
or
exempt
executives,
their
salary
must
be
fixed
and
not
contingent.
the
specifics
of
the
rule
provide
that
they
must
receive
a
predetermined
amount
not
subject
to
deduction
because
of
the
variations
in
quality
or
quantity
of
work.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
it
attempted
to
choose
not
to
go
along
with
that
at
all.
in
1975,
i
believe,
when
the
federal
government
first
came
under
the
act,
congress
provided
that
the
fair
labor
standard
act
would
be
enforced
by
the
office
of
personnel
management,
but
that
the
rule...
but
the
definitions
would
still
be
defined
and
delinated
by
the
department
of
labor,
and
when
the
office
of
personnel
management
initially
issued
regulations
for
the
federal
sector,
they
defined
exempt
status
for
salaried
persons
based
on
salary
classifications.
but
that
definition
was
challenged
in
court
in
a
specific
case
involving
the
uniform
division
of
the
secret
service,
police
sergeants
and
lieutenants,
and
the
court
of
claims
in
that
case
specifically
found
that
the
enforcement
by
the
office
of
personnel
management
has
to
be
undertaken
consistently,
consistent
with
the
department
of
labor
regulations,
because
it's
the
department
of
labor
that
defines
and
limits
exemptions--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--well,
first
of
all
the
court
of
claims
found
that
to
be
the
case.
they
found
it...
and
they
also
found
it
in
some
other
cases
involving
the
afg
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
and
currently
the
position
in
the
department
of
labor...
i'm
sorry.
the
position
in
the
federal
government
is
that
the
office
of
personnel
management
often
treats
people
as
exempt
even
though
they're
not
salaried,
but
the
court
of
claims
and
the
united
states
district...
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
have
held
that
they
should
apply
the
salary
test.
and
when
that
has
been
a
challenge...
and
the
one
place
it's
been
challenged
specifically
is
in
the
uniform
division
of
the
secret
service
and
for
employees
that
are
exactly...
do
the
exact
work
of
the
employees
in
this
case,
that
is,
sergeants
and
lieutenants
in
the
uniform
division,
and
the
court
ruled
that
the
department
of
labor
pay
classification
things
have
to
be
applied
consistent
with
the
salary
basis.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
i
believe
the--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--right.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
the
office
of
personnel
management
takes
the
position
that
federal
employees
can
be
exempted
based
on
pay
classification
alone.
i
do
not
think
that,
and
i
think
that
the
courts
have
found
that
to
be
the
case,
and
i
don't
think
it's
consistent
with
the
statute.
for
example,
when
congress
passed
the
statute
applying
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
themselves,
they
did
make...
apply
the
salary
basis
test
to
themselves,
and
under
the
professional
accountability
act,
the
regulations
under
that
act
specifically
say
that
the
salary
basis
test
does
apply
to
congressional
employees.
and
it
specifically
includes
the
regulation
including,
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
comments
on
the
regulation
of
whether
541.5d,
which
is
a
special
rule
limiting
part
of
it...
i'll
talk
about
in
a
minute...
how
that
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
congressional
accountability
office,
and
after
considering
the
comments
they
included
the
regulation
and
specifically
made
reference
to
the
applicability
of
the
salary
basis
test
to
congressional
employees.
so...
and
in
addition
to
that,
in
the
record
there's
a
history
of
the
department
of
labor's
current
consideration
of
the
regulations
and
as
part
of
that
history
the
director
of
omb
has
had
a
series
of
reports
and
considerations
with
the
department
of
labor
about
this
problem
and
what
to
deal...
how
to
deal
with
it
in
the
future.
so
the
answer
is,
the
office
of
personnel
management,
just
like
a
lot
of
employers
in
a
lot
of
places,
claim
that
they
can
exempt
people
based
on
classifications
alone,
but
when
the
federal
government
and
when
the
congress
have
looked
at
it
they've
said
they
have
to--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--right.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
they
have
a
regulation
to...
yes,
that's
true,
they
do,
and
in
the...
and
the...
that
raises
the
question
of
whether
that
would
make
all
federal
employees
subject
to
that
rule,
which
doesn't
cover
all
federal
employees,
but
i
think
it
covers
all
federal
employees
in
the
classified
service,
nonexempt,
and
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
struggle
the
department
of
labor
has
had,
and
that
is
why
the
department
of
labor
has
had
the
practical
rule
to
the
longstanding
salary
basis
test,
and
i
think
i
can
explain
how
the
practical
rule
i
think
works.
but
if
you
look
at,
and
we
attach
the
department
of
labor
briefs
going
back
from
1981
and
their
positions,
there
has
been
some
development
in
how
you
deal
with
the
problem
where
there's
a
rule
on
the
books
that
seems
counterintuitive.
how
can
an
employer
apply
that
rule?
and
i
think
the
rule
that
i
would
argue
is
that
the
first
rule
of
the
regulation,
and
after
all,
the
department
of
labor
that
issued
this
regulation
issued
it
under
a
direct
rule
of
congress,
is
that
the
employee's
salary
must
be
fixed,
and
it
cannot
be
contingent.
an
exempt
employee
cannot
have
contingent
income,
and
that,
however...
that
is
the
test,
and
then,
however,
there
can
be
a
situation
where
there
are
rules
on
the
books,
where
people
have
a
rule
that
says
you're...
you
can
be
subject
to
discipline
by...
for
14
days,
which
would
be
longer
than
a
work
period,
so
that
would
be
okay.
but
if
under
that
rule
they
discipline
somebody
for
1
day,
which,
by
the
way,
the
statute...
the
federal
regulation
doesn't
say
they
can
do,
but
if
they
did
do
it,
that
would
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
people
were
practically
subject
to
deductions
for
less
than
a
full
work
period,
and
i
think
in
that
case
you'd
have
to
prove...
if
all
you
had
was
a
rule
and
the
employer
claimed
that
the
people
were
exempt
and
that
they
were
not
doing
deductions,
i
think
the
burden's
on
the
employer
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence.
they
at
least
have
to
assert
that
we
wouldn't
exempt...
we
would
not
punish
anybody
for
less
than
a
pay
period,
which
the
federal
government
could
do
in
a--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--i
am...
i
am--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--i'm
asserting
that
all
sergeants
and
lieutenants
in
the
st.
louis
police
department
whose
pay
is
contingent
and
who
all
the
witnesses,
including
the
chief
of
police,
including
all...
everyone
who
testified,
no
one
ever
testified
that
any
sergeant
or
lieutenant's
pay
was
not
subject
to
discipline.
no
one
not
only
didn't
testify,
but
nobody
ever
even
asserted
that.
i
did
not
rely
on
mr.
guzy...
it
isn't
because
mr.
guzy
received
one
2-day
suspension
that
that
transferred
all
of
the
employees
who
had
a
contingent
pay--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--it...
i'm
sorry,
it
didn't...
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
did
happen
to
other
sergeants,
in
fact,
and
in
fact
it
did
happen
to
other
sergeants.
what's
not
in
the
record
is
an
example
of
a
specific
sergeant
who
testified
that
he
was
suspended,
but
the
reason
for
that
is,
if
you
look
at
the
whole
record,
the
case
was
bifurcated,
and
it
was
tried
on
the
basis
of
representative
witnesses.
for
example,
there
was
only
one
witness
that
testified
that
he
was
a
homicide
detective--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--and
yet
all
the
homicide
detectives--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--i
agree
that
a
one-time
suspension,
standing
in
isolation,
if
the
employer
took
the
position
that
the
pay
was
guaranteed
and
that
was
a
mistake,
it
was
inadvertent,
that
it
wouldn't
automatically
mean,
so
a
one-time
suspension
all
by
itself
would
not
settle
the
case,
and
one
reason
for
that
is
the
burden's
on
the
employer
in
the
first
in
to
establish...
in
the
first
instance
to
establish
the
employees
are
guaranteed
a
predetermined
amount
of
pay.
one
instance
of
a...
somebody
losing
a
guaranteed
amount
of
pay
would
certainly
raise
a
lot
of
suspicion,
but
if
the
employer
were
in
some
case...
in
a
given
case,
for
instance,
to
claim
that
was
a
mistake,
it
wasn't
under
the
rules,
that's
different.
but
in
our
case
the
chief
of
police,
the
30(b)(6)
designees
of
the
employer
for
exempt
status
and
for
application
to
the
regulations,
and
everyone
else
testified
that
in
fact
all
sergeants
were
subject
to
being
disciplined,
and
there
is
repeated
evidence
in
the
record
which...
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
in...
there
is...
at
page...
the
chief
of
police
testified
that
all
sergeants
were
subject
to
suspension.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
for
instance,
sergeant
michael
fredericks
testified
that
he
knew
of
sergeants
that
were
suspended
for
less
than
a
day.
there's
no...
there
is
no...
in
the
record
there
is
no
other
name
of
a
specific
sergeant
who
was
suspended,
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
in
fact
other
sergeants,
other
than
mr.
guzy,
were
suspended.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
because
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
agree
with
the
base
rule...
a)
they
didn't
agree
that
the
burden
was
on
the
employer
to
establish
that
pay
was
fixed
rather
than
contingent,
and
b)
they
put
the
burden
on
the
plaintiffs
to
establish
actual
instances
of
deduction,
which
i
don't
think
they
should
have
done,
but
looking
at
all
the
evidence
of
the
record,
no
one
could
conclude
from
the
evidence
of
that
record
that
the
regulation
which
says
pay
is
not
subject
to
deduction
was
followed
in
this
case.
i
mean,
it
would
be
different
if
the...
and
there
are
cases
that
are
reported--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--no.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
the
eighth
circuit...
the
eighth
circuit
said
that
mr.
guzy
was
suspended.
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
say
that
the
department
did
not
have
a
rule
that
made
everybody
subject
to
suspension.
they
don't
think
that's
required.
for
instance,
if
you
compare
the
eighth
circuit
decisions
to
the
decisions
in,
now,
seven
of
the
eight
circuits,
in
the
second
circuit
the
yourman
case,
in
the
third
circuit
the
balgowan
case,
in
the
fourth
circuit
the
shockley
case,
in
the
sixth
circuit
the
two
michigan
court
cases,
and
in
the
seventh
circuit
mueller
and
bankston,
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
abshire
and
six
or
seven
other
cases,
in
the
tenth
circuit
carpenter
and
spradling,
all
of
those
cases
heard
said
that
the
test
is
not
whether
or
not
there
were
actual
individual
instances
of
deductions.
the
question
is
whether
the
person
working
there
is
subject
is
fixed...
pay
is
fixed
or
contingent.
if
you
have
contingent
pay,
then
you
cannot
be
exempt,
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
if
you
only
say
the
people
who
are
disciplined
lose
the
exemption,
then
you
say
only
rule-breakers
would
be
exempt.
for
example,
in--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--mm-hmm.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
the...
there
aren't
a
series
of
letters
from
the
department.
the
department
of
labor
has
written
one
letter
in
one
other
place
where
they
said
that
they
will
look
for
regularly
recurring
exemptions,
but
they've
always
done
that
in
the
context
of
whether...
and
the
regulation
itself,
the
plain
wording
of
the
regulation
itself
says
the
key
is
whether
you're
subject
to
deduction,
not
whether
actual
deductions
occur.
there's
also
some
confusion
because--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--absolutely.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
could
i
make
one
other...
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
just
one
other
point.
that
department
of
labor
letter
also,
there's
another
thing
in
the
regulation.
there's
a
difference...
there's
two
parts
of
the
regulation.
one
talks
about
deductions
for
part
of
a
day
for
being
absent.
another
part
talks
about
disciplinary
deductions,
and
i
think
the
enact...
the
part
about
being
absent
for
part
of
a
day
doesn't
apply
in
the
public
sector
any
more
anyway,
and
i
can
explain
more
about
that
why...
why,
if
you
need
to.
but
the
point
is,
disciplinary
deductions
are
different
than
deductions
for
part
of
a
day.
an
employer
that
allows
employees
to
leave
for
part
of
a
day
means
to
adopt
a
flexible
work
schedule,
and
intends
people
to
be
able
to
come
and
go
as
they
please.
it
would
be
unusual
if
people
didn't
leave
for
part
of
a
day,
so
you'd
want
to
find...
you'd
expect
to
find
a
lot
of
people
who
did.
however,
disciplinary
rules
are
exactly
the
opposite.
the
reason
the
employer
imposes
disciplinary
rules
is
so
people
will
obey
them
and
anticipates
that
they
will
not
disobey
them.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
it's
covered
by...
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
the
manual,
in
this
case
the
police
manual
is
covered
by
all
commissioned
police
officers,
which
in
st.
louis
includes...
probably
doesn't
include
the
chief,
but
there's
two
deputy
chiefs.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
regular
line
officers.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
hypothetically
you
could
have
this
manual
in
some
police
department
where
you
ask
the
people
in
charge
of
discipline
do
you
apply
this
manual
to
sergeants
and
lieutenants,
and
they
could
say
no,
we
don't,
but
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
chief
of
police,
the
person
in
charge
of
discipline,
the
person
in
charge
of
record-keeping,
and
the
30(b)(6)
designee
in
terms
of
exemptions,
all
testified
that
sergeants
and
lieutenants
were
subject
to
the
manual,
and
those--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--so
it's
not
the
manual
alone.
it's
the
manual
plus.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
but
they
testified
that
they
were
subject
to
2-day
suspensions
and
suspensions
less
than
a
day
under
the
manual.
the
chief
testified
to
that,
the
30(b)(6)...
i
mean,
an
employer
could
have
that
manual--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--the
last
part
of
your
question...
there
is
evidence,
the
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
police
sergeant
or
lieutenant
in
the
st.
louis
police
department
who
violates
a
rule
that
provides...
has
one
of
the
potential
penalties
of
a
suspension
of,
say,
2
days,
is
subject
to
them,
is
that
the...
the
chief
testified
to
that
at
joint
appendix
page
60,
and
joint
appendix
page
62.
when
he
was
asked
did
he
recall
any
specific
person...
this
is
at
page
62...
who
had
ever
been
disciplined
he
said
he
didn't
remember
any
names,
but
yes,
there
would
be
people
that
had
done
that.
ms.
cortelyou,
who
was
the
recordkeeper
that
keeps
track
of
exemptions
testified
in
the
joint
appendix
from
page
49
through
57
that
people
were
not
subject
for
absenting
themselves
for
part
of
a
day
under
a
flexible
work
week
rule,
but
if
they
broke
the
rules,
they
were
subject
to
being
suspended
for
a
day
or
two,
and
she
specifically
said
that
they
could
be
disciplined
and
that
they
could
lose
pay
for
a
day
or
two.
larry
patterson--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--if
they
broke
the
rules
they
would
be,
and
they
said
that.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
that...
let
me
get
the
joint
appendix.
why
don't
i,
ma'am...
at
page
60...
let's
do
one
at
a
time.
that's
the
chief.
this
is
the
joint
appendix
at
page
60.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
chief
of
police
at
the
time,
robert
sheetz,
and
at
the
top
of
the
page...
well,
first
he
was
asked,
as
a
result
of
charges,
could
they
be
docked
pay,
and
there's
a
question
right
before
that.
and
at
the
top
of
the
page
he
says...
this
is
if
someone
was...
broke
a
rule,
could
they...
and
he
said,
i
would
say
that
he
probably
would
be.
he
could
be.
he
would
be
suspended
in
lieu
of,
say,
maybe
1-day
suspension
or
2-days
suspension.
i
don't
recall
that
we've
ever
docked
anybody,
you
know,
like
you're
docked
$10
or
something
like
that.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
recall
any
time
the
department
has
ever...
that
has
ever
happened.
but
i--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--no.
it
could
be,
except
he
says
more,
because
he's...
that...
there's
a
follow-up
on
that,
and
then
on
page
62--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--well,
it
goes
along...
there's
a
series
of
questions
about
that--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--this...
what
he...
let
me
get
you
the...
it's
on
page
62.
on
page
62
he
says--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--he
says
at
the
bottom
of
where...
40...
it
says,
okay.
do
you
know
if
a
sergeant
has
ever
been
disciplined
for
awol,
say
in
the
recent
past,
in
the
last
3
or
4
years?
i
don't
recall
any
specifics,
but
i
would
say
yes.
i
don't
take
the
chief's
testimony,
by
the
way,
in
isolation.
in
our
brief
on
page
42,
on
page
42
and
then
page
9
through
17,
we
go
through...
a
whole
bunch
of
witnesses
testified
that
people--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
right.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
right.
there
are.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
there
are
some
provisions
in
the
manual
that
the
penalty,
the
only
penalty
listed
there
is
less
than
a
full
week's--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--no.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
there
are,
and
there's
a
chart
in
the
manual
that
says
when
it's
docking
and
when
it's
not
docking,
and
in
some
of
the
penalties,
the
only
penalty...
for
instance,
in
the
second...
in
the
second
non...
in
the
preventable
accident,
the
only
penalty
is
a
1
or
2-day
suspension.
and
by
the
way,
it's
not
just
chief...
the
chief's
not
the
only
one
who
testified.
all
of
the
designees
testified
that
people
were
suspension
and
their
pay...
were
subject
to
being
suspended.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no...
i'm
sorry.
it
shows...
the
manual
at
page...
in
the
manual
from
page
43a...
this
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
and
from
page
43a
through
50...
49a
there
are
charts
that
have
the
list
of
all
the
violations
and
then
it
has
a
list
of
all
the
penalties,
and
it
says
what
the
penalty
is
for
a
first
offense
and
a
second
offense,
and
many
of
those
penalties
include
suspensions,
from
a
letter
of
reprimand
to
a
5-day
suspension,
and
for
a
first
or
second
day,
and
for
example,
one
of
the
penalties
provides
a
1-day
suspension.
that's
on
page
147.
and
so
it's
clear
that
the
sergeants
are
subject
to
being
suspended
for
periods
of
less
than
a
full
week.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
first...
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
under
the
statute
the
requirement
to
establish
exemptions,
the
burden
is
on
the
employer,
not
on
the
employee,
so
you
shouldn't
assume
anything.
the
second
thing,
however,
is,
suppose
the
employer...
the
employer
should
at
least
be
put
to
a
standard
of
proof
to
assert
that
sergeants
and
lieutenants...
have
some
witnesses
or
have
somebody
assert
on
the
record
that
sergeants
and
lieutenants
are
not
subject
to
being
suspended
for
a
2-day
suspension,
for
example,
and
in
this
case
the
employer
simply
never
did
that.
the
reason
they
simply
never
did
that
is,
people
had
been
suspended,
and
it...
there
are--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--well,
for
instance,
sergeant
frederick
testified
that
there
were
other
instances,
but
he
didn't
name--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--right.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
the
first
reason
you
shouldn't
assume
that
the
employer,
just
because
they
claim
exemptions,
that
they
automatically
are
going
to
apply
all
the
rules
not
to
do
exemptions,
is
because
that
would
put
the
burden
on
the
employees
to
prove
exempt
status.
the
second
reason
which
you
should
not
approve
it
is
because
it's
contrary
to
the
whole
idea
of
having...
of
the
plain
wording
of
the
statute
itself,
which
says
it's
not
the
act
of
making
exemptions,
but
it's
the
fact
of
putting
employees
and
making
their
pay
subject
to
deductions,
that's
been
the--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--sure.
the
department...
the
regulations
go
on,
if
you
read
the
whole
regulations,
and
down
at
a
later
point
it
talks
about
discipline
for
safety
reasons
but
not
discipline
for
other
reasons.
plus,
the
department
of
labor
has
interpreted
the
regulations
for
40
years
to
require
disciplinary
docking,
and
there's
a
lot
of
cites
in
the
record,
plus--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--the
last
20
seconds--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--the
quality
of
work--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--thank
you.
