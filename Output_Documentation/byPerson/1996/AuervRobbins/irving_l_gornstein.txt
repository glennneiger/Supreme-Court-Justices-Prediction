mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
the
existence
of
the
respondent's
police
manual
cannot
by
itself
show
that
petitioners
as
a
class
are
subject
to
disciplinary
deductions
of
less
than
1
week's
pay
within
the
meaning
of
the
secretary's
salary
basis
test,
and
we
reach
that
conclusion
for
three
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
secretary
interprets
the
phrase
subject
to
reduction
to
mean
that
there
must
be
more
than
a
theoretical
possibility
that
a
violation
of
a
work
rule
will
result
in
a
partial
week
disciplinary
deduction.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
would
say
that
if
you
just
had
that
you
could
reach
that
conclusion,
justice
souter,
subject
to
whatever
the
employer
might
show
in
response
to
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
you
are...
that
if
the
only
possible
sanctions
are...
if
i
took
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--class--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it's
a
book
for
sergeants,
and
the
only
possible
sanctions
are
partial
week
disciplinary
sanctions.
i
think
you
could
infer
from
that
that
sergeants
as
a
class
are
subject
to
reductions,
subject
to
the
employer
coming
back
and
say,
look,
we
don't
really...
i
know
we
said
this,
but
this
is
out
of
date,
or
it's
ineffective
for
some
reason.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
does
for
purposes
of
the
regulation,
justice--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
i
doubt
very
much
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
right,
and
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think,
justice...
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
what
the
secretary
did
when
he
originally
formulated
the
regulations
was
to
try
to
draw
a
line
that
would
not
necessarily
make
a
100-percent
case
in
every
single
case,
but
would
be
a
reasonable
line
for
the
vast
amount
of
cases.
and
what
the
secretary
concluded,
based
on
hearings
that
were
held
after,
in
the
wake
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
being
enacted,
is
that
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
having
the
exempt
status,
the
exempt...
that
exempt
employees,
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
the
importance
and
status
that
those
employees
had
is
that
they
were
paid
on
a
weekly
basis,
that
for
any
week
in
which
they
worked
they
would
receive
a
full
week's
pay.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
it
is
wrong
to--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia,
what
the
statute
says
is
that
they
are
executive,
administrative,
and
professional,
as
defined
by
the
secretary.
that's
what
the
statute
says,
and
it
gives
the
secretary
wide
leeway
to
give
content
to
the
meaning
of
those
terms.
and
what
the
secretary
has
done
is
set
out
an
administrable
statute,
not
to
leave
to
a
district
court
or
an
employer
in
every
case
to
figure
out
whether
under
the
totality
of
circumstances
we
are
going
to
regard
this
person
as
executive,
administrative,
or
professional.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
some
other
way,
or
if
it
was
a
one-time
deduction,
then
the
window
of
correction
could
be
used
to
retroactively
restore
his
exempt
status.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
does,
but
i
would--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
is
correct,
that
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
get
to
the
window
of
correction
to
decide
that,
though.
i
think
you
can
look
at
just
the
text
of
the
541.118
and
here
we
interpret
the
term,
subject
to
reduction,
to
mean
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
employees
in
the
class
have
to
face
a
significant
possibility
of
having
their
pay
reduced.
if
there
is
no
such
practice,
there
is
no
such
policy,
and
nonetheless
there
is
a
deduction
taken,
for
whatever
reason,
then
you
look
to
the
window
of
correction
to
restore
retroactive
status.
now,
the
second
point--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
burden--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that
there's
not
a
significant
possibility.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct,
that
there's
not
a
significant
possibility
that
employees
in
this
class
will
face
partial
week
disciplinary
suspensions.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
let
me
talk
about
the
manual
on
its
face,
because
the
manual
is
broadly
applicable
to
all
employees,
both
those
who
clearly
perform
exempt
duties,
like
captains
on
up,
and
clearly
perform
nonexempt
duties,
like
patrol
officers
who
patrol
the
beat,
and
those
rules
can
all
be
enforced
in
ways
that
are
completely
consistent
with
retaining
exempt
status
for
those
employees
who
perform
clearly
exempt
duties,
so
i
think
if
you
just
look
at
the
manual--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
that
as
the
case
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
really
put
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals,
you
can
just
look
at
the
manual
and
you
can
add
in
the
guzy
incident,
and
we
should
win
this
case.
none
of
this
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
none
of
this
was
part
of
the
question
that
was
framed
for
review
by
this
court.
again,
i
think
the
question
that
was
framed
for
review
by
this
court
was,
can
you
just
look
at
this
manual
and
conclude
that
these
people
are
subject
to
disciplinary
deductions.
the
burden
of
proof
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
don't
think
it
was
raised
here.
i
think
there
is
a
problem.
when
you
look
at
all
the
testimony
there's
a
lot
of
ambiguous
statements
about
what
could
or
could
not
happen.
but
i
think
as
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
to
this
court
at
the
certiorari
stage,
the
understanding
was
there
was
not
a
single
incident
of
actual
deductions
having
ever
occurred
with
the
exception
of
the
one
case
of
sergeant
guzy,
and
that
took
place
under
such
highly
unusual
circumstances
that
i
don't
think
it
was
indicative
that
sergeants
as
a
class
face
a
significant
possibility
of
having
their
pay
reduced.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
with
respect
to
sergeant
guzy,
that
in
our
view
the
only...
the
window
of
correction
is
only
implicated
with
respect
to
sergeant
guzy.
that
incident
doesn't
show
that
the
class
is
subject--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
sergeant--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
don't
think
that
that
is...
i
think
that
the
position
of
the
employer
here
is,
we
don't
think
we
owed
sergeant
guzy
money,
but
if
we
do,
we
want
to
be
able
to
restore
his
retroactive
status,
and
under
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
that
in
fact
what
they
did
is,
they
took
a
view
similar
to
the
one
that
justice
kennedy
was
raising
in
his
question
about
what
it
means
to
be
subject
to
reduction
for
quality
and
quantity
of
work,
and
they
said,
we
don't
think
guzy
was
reduced
for
that
reason,
but
if
he
was,
we
want
to
restore
his
status
retroactively.
in
our
view,
the
window
of
correction--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
window
of
correction
rule
that
precludes
an
employee
from
correcting
after
litigation.
i...
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
prelitigation
correction
rule
in
the
window.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
he
was
originally
filed,
or
that
was
the
original
imposition
of
a
penalty,
was
a
firing,
which
would
not
implicate
the
rule
at
all.
