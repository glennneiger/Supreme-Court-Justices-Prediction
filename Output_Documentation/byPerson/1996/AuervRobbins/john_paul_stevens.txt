justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--go
ahead
and
finish...
you
had--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
ask
the
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
the
question
i've
been
trying
to
ask
for
a
little
while?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
manual...
you
rely
heavily
on
the
manual,
and
you
rely
on
this
testimony
they
might
be
disciplined.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
not
agree
that
there
are
forms
of
discipline
other
than
docking
for
a
day's
pay,
or
2
days'
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this...
the
general...
the
text
of
the
manual
doesn't
make
out
your
case.
it's
only
if
you
can
get
enough--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
only
form
of
discipline
is
docking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
so
the
manual
itself
doesn't
get
you
home,
at
least,
nor
does
the
testimony
at
page
62,
because
he
just
says
there's
been
some
discipline,
and
i
think
that
we
must
assume
that
there
are
possibly
forms
of
discipline
other
than
docking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't
it
probative
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
it
probative
of
the
treatment
of
the
whole
class
when
they
said,
well,
we'll
correct
it
if
we
have
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
don't
think
they
owe
him
money,
they
must
interpret
the
fact
that
they
ever...
they
are
agreeing
with
your
opponent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
court
has
to
tell
him
why
he
was
reduced.
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
just
address
the
one
thing
that
i
find
a
little
puzzling?
why,
if
you're
correct
that
the...
sergeant
guzy
was
not
subject
to
the
particular
discipline
he
got,
why
hasn't
he
been
repaid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
construe
the
disciplinary
manual
really
as
saying
that
although
you
may
have
some
of
the
deductions,
we
won't
have
them
if
they're
based
on
defects
in
quality
or
quantity
of
work.
