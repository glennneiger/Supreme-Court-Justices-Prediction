justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
see
even
on
that
reasoning
that
it's
clear,
because
i
come
back
to
a
question
that's
been
asked
before.
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary,
why
shouldn't
we
assume
that
an
employer
who
knows
that
he
cannot
apply
a
particular
disciplinary
form
consistent
with
the
status,
with
the
salaried
status
for
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
will
not
apply
it?
you've
got
a
manual
that
applies
across
the
board
to
everybody.
why
shouldn't
we
assume,
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary,
that
the
employer
will
not
apply
what
is
in
that
manual
in
such
a
way
as
to
destroy
the
salaried
status?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
know
of
only
one
instance,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
he
couldn't
come
up
with
any.
the
only
specific
instance
that
is
in
fact
shown
on
the
record
is
this
one--
justice
david
h.
souter
--instance,
guzy,
or
guzy.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
more
than
theoretical
possibility
be
satisfied
in
an
instance
in
which
the
employer
had
promulgated
the
manual
solely
to
salaried
employees,
and
yet
nonetheless
provided
as
to
them
that
there
would
be
these
impermissible
dockings.
would
you
say
that
was
enough
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--only
possible
sanctions
and
the
only
possible
class--
justice
david
h.
souter
--was
a
salaried
class.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the...
what
do
you
do
with
the
point
that
your
brother
was
making
about
the
record,
that
the
chief
and
the
others
who
came
in
and
testified
didn't
testify
that
these
particular
sanctions
would
be
applied
only
to
the
nonsalaried.
they
said
something
like,
well,
gee,
yeah,
i
guess
it
could,
but
i
can't
think
of
any
instance.
they
didn't
take
the
position
that's
consistent
with
your
argument,
did
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
you
agree
that
if
you
had
a
manual
that
applied
only
to
salaried
employees,
and
specifically
provided
for
discipline
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
salaried
status,
that
that
would
be
enough
to
preclude
salaried
status?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
wouldn't...
wouldn't
we
be
entitled
to
act
on
the
assumption
that
the
manual
was
not
a
totally
nugatory
exercise
and
that,
in
at
least
some
instances,
consistently
with
the
manual,
discipline
would
be
applied?
wouldn't
that
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
a
decision?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
your
argument
has
to
say...
it
seems
to
me
seems
to
be,
even
when
they
specifically
say
they
will
do
and
are
entitled
to
do
what
is
inconsistent
with
salaried
status,
we
won't
take
them
at
their
word.
we'll
wait
and
see.
that
surely
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
i
quite
agree,
but
that's
not
the
case
that
i
put
to
you
in
the
question.
