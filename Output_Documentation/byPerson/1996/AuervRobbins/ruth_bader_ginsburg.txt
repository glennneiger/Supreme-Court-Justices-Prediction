--may
i
ask
a
question
about
these
disciplinary
rules?
is
this
manual
applicable
to
all
employees,
including
people
who
are
undoubtedly
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
this
is
not
a
discrete
code
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
for
professional,
administrative,
and
executive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
include
people
who
are
covered
by
the
flsa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
why
couldn't
somebody
look
at
this
code
and
say,
gee,
it's
got
a
range
of
sanctions,
from
reprimand
to
dismissal,
and
we'll
assume
that
a
law-abiding
employer
is
going
to
apply
to
the
people
who
are
subject
to
the
act,
the
sanctions,
the
full
range
of
sanctions,
but
to
the
people
who
are
exempt,
only...
only
those
sanctions
that
would
fit
with
exempt
status.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it's...
but
one
could
say
yes,
the
manual,
but
only
those
sanctions
in
it
that
are
compatible
with
exempt
status.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
testimony
in
this
record
that
says
people
who
are
in
this
category
in
fact
got
such
sanctions,
that
there
was
a
pattern
and
practice
of
applying
the
sanctions
that
would
ordinarily
be
disqualifying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could,
but
where--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
is
this
testimony?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
which
is
the
testimony
from
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
seems
to
me
the
answer
is,
as
long
as
i've
been
in
this
department,
it
hasn't
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
the
followup?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
see
the
last
statement
he
made
is,
i
don't
recall
in
my
time
in
the
department
that
that
ever
happened.
now,
what
qualifies
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
in
actual
cases,
and
what
i
tried
to
ask
you
before
about
this
manual,
which
has
a
range
of
sanctions...
and
discipline
doesn't
show
docking.
discipline
can
be
many
things,
from
a
reprimand
to
termination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
we
don't
need
to
get
to
the
window
of
correction,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
the
employer...
as
i
understand
the
guzy
case
there
was
a
kind
of
a
plea
bargain
for
this
lesser
sanction
when
the
sanction
that
eventually
was
made,
the
single
sanction
termination,
would
not
have
affected
fls--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
your
main
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
you...
accepting
the
government's
current
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
that
you
properly
prevailed
in
the
eighth
circuit,
but
didn't
you...
you
made...
one
of
your
border
attacks
was
on
the
government's
position
as
irrational
in
distinguishing
between
suspension
for
a
full
week
versus
a
couple
of
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
were
to
get
into
that,
we
would
be
going
considerably
beyond
where
the
eighth
circuit
was
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
might
be
your
dispute
with
the
secretary
of
labor,
but
it
doesn't...
this
case,
your
victory
in
this
case
doesn't
turn
on--
