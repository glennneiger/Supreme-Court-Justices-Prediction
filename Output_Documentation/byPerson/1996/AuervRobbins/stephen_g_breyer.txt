justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
the
part
i
don't
understand...
see,
you're
all
knowledgeable,
and
i
just
don't
understand
this.
i
don't
know
which
way
it
cuts.
but
there's
a
statute
here,
and
the
statute
uses
the
words,
executive,
professional,
or
administrative
employees,
and
it
says
they're
not
subject
to
overtime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
there's
a
reg
that
i
can't
fit
with
the
statute.
that
is,
suppose
microsoft
says,
bill
gates
has
to
dock
a
day's
pay
every
time
he
wrongly
uses
the
corporate
jet,
okay.
does
that
make
bill
gates
an
hourly
employee,
subject
to
overtime?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
does,
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
statute,
because
i
would
think
there's
no
one
in
history
who's
less
an
hourly
worker
than
bill
gates--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
so
if
you
have
a
reg--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
seems
to
make
him
an
hourly
worker,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
i
want
to
understand,
how
that
fits
within
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
good,
and
so
that's
why
you
say
the
effect
of
making
a
deduction
which
is
not
permitted
under
the
rule
as
a
practical
matter
depends
on
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
the
reg
says,
and
are
you
saying
that
then
here
you
look
at
practically
what
happens
in
this
case.
you're
saying
as
a
practical
matter
the
facts
of
this
case
show
the
deductions
that
they
made
didn't
transmute
them
into
hourly
employees.
