but
justice
o'connor
was
not
asking
about
court
decisions,
she
was
asking
about
the
position
being
taken
by
the
executive
branch--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
in
fact...
and
opm
takes
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--view
from
labor,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
makes
it
the
hallmark.
he
doesn't
make
it
one
of
the
characteristics.
he
says,
this
is
the
criterion,
and
is
it
adequate
to
say,
you
know,
that
will
handle
maybe
90
percent
of
the
cases.
it
won't
get
gates,
but,
you
know,
close
enough
for
government
work.
is
that
what
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
the
fact
is,
gates
shouldn't
be
within
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
response
is,
if
microsoft
doesn't
like
it,
it
can
just
rescind
the
rule
that...
you
know,
punish
gates
some
other
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
burden
is
on
the
employer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
show
that
there
is
no
such
possibility,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
this
case
the
employer
bears
not
just
that
initial
burden,
but
also
the
burden
of
overcoming
a
manual
which
on
its
face
is
applicable
to
all
employees,
and
on
its
face
seems
to
say
that
these
people
are
subject
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
could
say
that's
not
my
fault,
that's
the
secretary's
fault.
he
wrote
this
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we'll
blame
it
on
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
secre...
but
penalties
may
be
imposed.
if
it
says
penalties
may
be
imposed,
your
position
is
that
would
not
be
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
all
the
text
of
the
regulation
says
is
not
which
amount
must
be
reduced
because
of
variations
in
the
quality
or...
it
says
which
amount
is
not
subject
to
reduction,
and
you
know,
subject
to
reduction
doesn't
mean
will
certainly
be
reduced.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
means
it's
subject
to
reduction,
and
as
i
understood
the
exception
is,
if
that
thing
is
just
a
paper
tiger,
that
in
fact
it
is
never
used,
that's
one
thing,
but
if
it's
even
used
in
one
case,
it
seems
to
me
that's
enough
to
show
that
it's
for
real.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
burden's
on
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
burden's
on
the
employer
here
to
show
that
nobody
had.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
anyone
come
in
on
behalf
of
the
employer
and
say,
nobody
has?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
claim
to
have
established
at
trial
that
nobody
had,
that
nobody
had
been
subjected
to
this
disqualifying
kind
of
discipline?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
your
burden.
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
does
the
distinction
between
suspension
for
less
than
a
week
and
suspension
for
a
week
make
sense
for
non-government
employees,
or
nonpolice
employees,
rather?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
theory
of
it?
why
does--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suspended
for
a
whole
week,
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
they
also...
the
docking
rule
also
applies.
a
docking
for
a
whole
week
is
okay,
even
though
you
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
