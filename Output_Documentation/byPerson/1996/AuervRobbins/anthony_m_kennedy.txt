but
on
that
point,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
regulation,
which
says,
subject
to...
not
subject
to
reduction
because
of
variations
in
the
quality
or
quantity
of
work
might
not
apply
to
discipline
at
all.
it
might
be
just
the
operational
needs
of
the
employer.
on
one
day
you
have
to
unload
the
dustbin,
and
on
the
other
day
you
get
to
perform
a
skilled
job.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
plausible
reading
and
that
that's
all
that
it
means.
is
there
any
authority
to
support
my
reading
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
authority
in
the
circuits
to
support
the
argument
that
the
subject
to
clause
doesn't
apply
to
disciplinary
actions
at
all,
it
simply
applies
when
the
work
changes,
for
the
operational
needs
of
the
employer?
that
is
what
i
thought
was
the
common
sense
reading
of
it
when
i
read
the
regulation,
but
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
support
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
such
a
common
sense
reading
that
none
of
the
circuits
seem
to
have
adopted
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
agency
ever
expressly
rejected
the
interpretation
i
suggest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
any
number--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--any
number
of
the
specific
rulings,
the
letters
that
the
secretary
has
given
seems
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
reading
i
suggest.
or
is
that
correct?
