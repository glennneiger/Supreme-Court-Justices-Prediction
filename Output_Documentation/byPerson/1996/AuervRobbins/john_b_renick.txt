mr.
john
b.
renick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
address
this...
at
least
partially
this
question
about
the
chief
of
police's
testimony.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
understand
that
the
chief
of
police
does
not
impose
discipline.
that
is
the
role
of
the
police
board,
which
is
the
defendant
in
this
case.
secondly,
if
you
examine
the
testimony
that
mr.
leibig
was
referring
to,
the
chief
consistently
says,
you
know,
maybe
that
could
happen,
it's
possible,
but
he
can't
recall
it
ever
happening,
and
i
think
that's
important,
and
i
think
that
points
out
the
problem
with
petitioner's
position
here
as
to
someone
who's
subject
to
a
deduction.
and
it
goes
to
justice
breyer's
point.
logically,
you
could
file
one
of
these
lawsuits
and
take
the
deposition
of
the
chief
executive
officer
and
simply
ask
the
question,
is
it
possible
that
you
could
discipline
one
of
your
vice
presidents
who
is
found
to
have
engaged
in
some
kind
of
misconduct
for
a
period
of
less
than
a
week.
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
it's
possible,
because
that
is
part
of
the
inherent
right
of
management,
then
the
logical
extension
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
everyone
in
that
organization,
because
they
are
conceivably
subject
to
an
improper
deduction,
would
be
nonexempt.
therefore,
no
one,
whether
you're
a
vice
president,
or
bill
gates,
whatever
it
would
be,
under
that
theory
would
be
exempt.
mr.
john
b.
renick
well--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--we
think
that
that
shows
that
that
interpretation
really
doesn't
make
sense.
mr.
john
b.
renick
if
the
discipline...
if
the
manual
was
worded
in
such
a
way
that
discipline
was
mandatory,
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
souter.
mr.
john
b.
renick
yes,
but
i
still--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--what
i'm
saying
is,
and
i
think
the
secretary
of
labor
has
agreed
with
our
position,
is
that...
is
that
as...
you
have
to
look
at
what
actual
experience...
the
best
evidence
is
what
is
the
actual
experience
in
the
application
of
whatever
manual...
if
you
have
a
manual
or
not,
what
has
actually
happened,
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
very
clear.
in
1979,
which
was
6
years
before
the
garcia
case
was
decided
by
this
court,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
missouri
amended
the
governing
statute
which
controls
the
operations
of
the
st.
louis
police
department
to
convert
all
commissioned
officers
at
the
rank
of
sergeant
or
above
to
a
salary
basis
of
payment.
it
specifically
amended
the
statute
to
disallow
payment
of
overtime
and
to
compensate
for
that
they
gave
everyone
an
across-the-board
8
percent
increase,
and
none
of
the
individuals
in
this
case
have
come
forward...
contrary
to
any
other
representations,
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
evidence...
we
had
288
sergeants
by
the
time
we
go
to
trial.
not
a
single
one
of
those
sergeants
took
the
witness
stand
and
testified
that
he
or
she
had
actually
suffered
an
improper
deduction.
mr.
john
b.
renick
well,
i
think
i'm
agreeing
with
you
if
you
have
a
manual
that
says
this
is
specifically
applicable
to
exempt
employees,
or
functionally
exempt,
and
it
provides
that
penalties
will
be
imposed
for
certain
forms
of
misconduct
that
would
be
periods
of
less
than
a
week,
if
you
accept
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
salary
basis
test,
then
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
john
b.
renick
well,
i
think
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
practice,
because
i
think
as
one
of
the
justices
earlier
pointed
out,
i
think
you...
where
there
are
a
range
of
penalties,
as
there
are
in
this
case,
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
employer
is
going
to
choose
a
new
proper
penalty
and
thereby
convert
all
of
his
or
her
salaried
employees
to
nonexempt
employees.
mr.
john
b.
renick
well--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--well,
but
the
state
of
the
record
here,
justice
scalia,
is
that
in
the
period
between
1979,
when
the
statute
was
amended,
and
the
time
we
went
to
trial
in
1993,
not
one
witness
came
forth
to
testify
that
he
or
she
had
been
subjected
to
a
disciplinary
proceeding
initiated
by
the
department,
by
the
police
department,
based
on
a
variation,
which
is
the
word
in
the
interpretation,
on
a
variation
in
the
quality
or
quantity
of
work.
there's--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--not
one
appears.
mr.
john
b.
renick
the
employer--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--the
employer
prevailed
on
the
salary
test
on
partial
summary
judgment
prior
to
the
trial,
and
the
record
shows
that
i
queried
the
trial
judge
both
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
my
presentation
to
ensure
that
that
issue
was
no
longer
in
the
case.
mr.
john
b.
renick
at
the
trial
there
was
no
evidence
to
that
effect
because
we
had
prevailed
on
partial
summary
judgment
prior
to
trial.
mr.
john
b.
renick
the
trial
judge
found
that
we
met
that
burden
when
he
ruled
in
a
pretrial
ruling
which
granted
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
salary
basis
issue
and
took
that
out
of
the
case.
mr.
john
b.
renick
well,
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
for
that.
first
of
all,
we
believe,
and
i
think
it's
clear,
that
the
basis
for
the
discipline
in
that
case
was
the
fact
that
he
had
violated
a
city
residency
requirement.
mr.
john
b.
renick
which
was
a
requirement
of
employment.
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
quality
or
quantity
of
his
work,
so
it
would
be
my
position
that
he
was
never
subjected
to
a
reduction
in
his
salary
based
on
anything
that
had
to
do
with
the
quality
or
quantity
of
his
work,
which
is
the
phrase
that
the
secretary
uses.
secondly,
our
position
has
been
consistently
in
this
litigation
that
if
we
are
wrong...
and
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
actually
only
says
arguably
that
this
deduction
made
sergeant
guzy
nonexempt,
and
we
think
it's
just
as
reasonable
that
it
may
not
be,
but
our
position
has
been
all
along
that
if
at
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
it
is
determined
that
that
was
an
impermissible
deduction,
the
salary
test
basis
is
validly
applied
to
the
board
of
police
commissioners,
then
we
will
comply
by
reimbursing
sergeant
guzy,
and
we
will
continue
our
existing
practice
of
not
allowing
deductions
of
less
than
a
week
for
exempt
officers.
mr.
john
b.
renick
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
renick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
renick
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
john
b.
renick
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
renick
well,
the
first
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
as
i
recall,
is
does
the
salary
basis
test
validly
apply
to
public
employees,
and
we
would
say
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
just
demonstrates
that
taking
this
disciplinary
deduction
rule
and
trying
to
apply
it
to
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
john
b.
renick
i
agree
with
you,
justice--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--that's
correct,
justice.
we--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--i
don't
believe
that
we
did.
we
don't
believe
that
we
have
ever
waived
that.
they
pointed
out
that
we
consented
to
the
judgment,
but
i
believe
the...
our
eleventh
amendment
argument
is
based
on
this
court's
decision
on
seminole
tribe
v.
florida,
which
only
came
out,
i
believe,
march
of
this
year,
but
at
the
time
this
litigation
was
taking
place,
my
recollection
is
that
pennsylvania
v.
union
gas
was
still
good
law,
and
there
was
really
no
basis
for
me
to
make
that
claim
until
this
court
decided
the
seminole
tribe.
mr.
john
b.
renick
well,
we
raised
it
simply
at
the
point
in
time
that
the
court's
seminole
tribe
decision
had
come
out,
and
the
timing
of
the
sequence
of
events,
we
raised
it
basically
as
a
jurisdictional
issue,
which,
as
i
read
the
court's
cases,
can
be
raised
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
john
b.
renick
i
think
that
is
the
common
sense
reading.
when
you
read
541.118(a)
in
the
general
sense,
what
the
secretary
of
labor--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--the
circuits--
[laughter]
the
circuits
have
all
picked
up
the
point
of
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
that
a
disciplinary
suspension
fits
under
541.118(a)(5),
which
says
penalties...
it's
actually
worded
in
the
affirmative,
that
an
employer
may
impose
penalties
which...
for
violations
of
major
safety
rules.
that
has
since
been
interpreted
to
mean
a
penalty
can
be
a
suspension
without
pay,
and
the
courts
have
then
read
and
said
the
converse
of
that,
then,
is
that
you
can't
impose
a
penalty
for
something
that's
not
a
violation
of
a
major
safety
rule,
and
i
think
that's
how
we
get
where
we
are
here.
mr.
john
b.
renick
not
to
my
knowledge,
although
it
is
a
matter
of
record
at
pages
43
through
46
of
the
joint
appendix
that
the
secretary
of
labor
went
on
record
this
may
and
indicated
that
there
was
still
confusion
among
litigants,
particularly
in
the
public
sector,
as
to
what
all
this
means,
and
it
appears
that
the
secretary
intends
to
undertake
some
kind
of
a
rulemaking
procedure
to
review
this
disciplinary
aspect
of
the
salary
test.
mr.
john
b.
renick
it
has
never
been
done
to
date.
mr.
john
b.
renick
i
can't
cite
you
to
one,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
john
b.
renick
that's
correct.
we
believe
that,
particularly
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
law
enforcement
agency
where
you
have
a
recognized
exception
that...
and
you...
and
again,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
premise
that
all
of
these
sections
of
the
salary
basis
test
are
based
on
studies
that
were
conducted
in
the
1940's
and
fifties,
when
public
employers
were
not
subject
to
the
law,
and
that's
part
of
the
problem,
is
now
trying
to
take
what
seemed
to
make
sense
back
in
the
1940's
and
fifties,
when
these
studies
were
done,
and
then
there
was
never
any
contemplation
that
the
law
would
apply
to
public
employers.
mr.
john
b.
renick
that
would
be
true,
yes,
but
we
believe
that,
as
i
said,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
this
demonstrates
that...
and
the
secretary
has
specifically
recognized
that
you
don't
treat
law
enforcement
agencies
the
same
as
even
other
public
employees,
let
alone
private
employees.
there
are
differences
in
the
standards
for
hours
worked,
there
are
differences
in
the
fact
that
they
get
compensatory
time,
and
our
point
here
is
that
this
disciplinary
deduction
prohibition
doesn't
make
sense
when
you
try
to
fit
it
into
this
kind
of
a
situation.
this
is
a...
as
the
trial
judge
found,
this
is
a
quasimilitary
organization,
it
would
be
my
position,
where
the
sole
or
primary
function
of
the
st.
louis
police
department
is
to
ensure
the
public
safety,
that
by
limiting
our
ability
to
impose
discipline
on
the
members
of
that
police
department,
that
the
secretary
of
labor,
in
application,
that
that
application
is
improper,
it's
arbitrary,
it's
capricious,
and
should
be
invalid.
mr.
john
b.
renick
it
doesn't
depend
on
that.
our
position
is
that
if
you
assume
that
the
regulations
and
the
secretary's
interpretations
are
entirely
valid
in
their
application
to
the
st.
louis
police
board,
that
the
actions
in
this
case
demonstrate
first
of
all
the...
we
tried
the
case.
we
had
21
different
categories
of
sergeants,
all
of
whom
were
found
to
perform
exempt
functions
as
either
executive
or
administrative
employees.
they
were
functionally
exempt,
and
they've
come
to
this
court
and
claimed
that
solely
because
they
were
subject
to
a
disciplinary
action
which
might
possibly
include
a
suspension
of
less
than
a
week,
for
that
sole
reason,
without
demonstrating
that
it
ever
actually
happened,
that
they
are
thus
nonexempt,
and
we
think--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--why
does
it
make
sense?
mr.
john
b.
renick
i
don't
know
that
it
does.
it
just...
that
has
been
in
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
541.118(a)
i
think
since
1954.
mr.
john
b.
renick
the
secretary--
mr.
john
b.
renick
--it's
just
included,
a
proviso
that
says
in
a
week
in
which
an
employee
performs
no
work
at
all,
that
the
employer
is
under
no
obligation
to
pay
the
salary.
there
are
some
distinctions
as
to
when
you
have
to
pay
the
full
salary.
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
that
generally,
if
you
perform
any
work
at
all
within
a
week,
if
you're
a
salaried
employee,
you
shouldn't
lok
at
the
number
of
hours.
it
shouldn't
matter.
you're
entitled
to
your
full
salary.
then
they
draw
the
distinction
and
say,
in
a
week
in
which
no
work
is
performed,
that
the
employer
need
not
pay
the
salary.
mr.
john
b.
renick
docking
for
a
whole
week
of
work
is
okay,
according
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
john
b.
renick
well,
we
think
that's
even
more
so
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
in
1992
the
secretary
of
labor
amended
the
regulation
541.5d
that
applies
to
public
employees,
so
that
the
salary
basis
test,
if
you
read
it,
doesn't
even
mean
what
it
says
for
public
employees,
because
the
salary
basis
test
says
you're
supposed
to
receive
a
predetermined
amount
of
compensation
every
pay
period
that
is
not
subject
to
reduction
based
on
quality
or
quantity
of
work.
the
secretary
of
labor,
through
a
rulemaking
procedure
in
'91,
looked
at
the
outcry
that
this
caused
in
the
public
area,
that
there
are
many
people
who
are
exempt,
but
because
of
principles
of
public
accountability
are...
under
state
laws
are
not
able
to
be
paid
for
time
they
don't
work,
so
the
secretary
amended
the
regulation
to
specifically
allow
a
public
employer
to
make
deductions
on
an
hour-by-hour
basis
from
an
otherwise
exempt
employee's
salary
and
still
allow
them
to
claim
that
they're
paid
on
a
salary
basis,
which
in
and
of
itself
is
inconsistent.
so
the
salary
basis
test
as
applied
to
public
employers
no
longer
means
what
it
says,
and
we
say,
why
should
there
be
this
disciplinary
deduction
aspect
maintained
when
the
secretary
has
already
recognized
that
the
variation
in
quantity
of
work
does
not
destroy
the
salary
basis.
i
would
also
point
out
that,
in
the
petition
that
was
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
they
took
the
position
very
clearly
that
this
court
was
required
to
defer
to
the
interpretations
of
the
secretary
of
labor,
and
this
court
invited
the
views
of
the
government,
asking
the
solicitor
general
to
file
a
brief
prior
to
deciding
whether
or
not
to
accept
this
case.
in
that
case,
the
secretary
of
labor's
views
were
specifically
expressed,
and
it
was
described
in
that
brief
as
for
the
sole...
for
the
very
specific
purpose
of
clarifying
what
the
secretary's
position
was
on
these
interpretations,
and
the
secretary
has
specifically
disagreed
with
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioners.
but
the
petitioners
continue
nonetheless
to
have
had...
apparently
have
had
a
change
of
heart
as
to
the
deference
owed
to
the
secretary
of
labor
under
the
circumstances,
and
we
would
submit
that
the...
whether
or
not
the
secretary's
interpretations
are
agreeable
to
the
petitioner
should
not
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
entitled
to
deference
in
this
case,
and
we
believe,
under
the
circumstances,
that
they
clearly
are,
and
as
i
said
earlier,
if
you
accept
the
secretary's
current
clarification
of
what
the
interpretations
mean,
this
case
fits
squarely
within
it,
whether
or
not
you
get
to
the
window
of
correction.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
