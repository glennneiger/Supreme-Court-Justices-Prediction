i've
noticed
with
interest
that
the
federal
government
does
not
follow
the
salary
basis
test
for
employees
that
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
office
of
personnel
management.
it
chooses
not
to
go
along
with
that
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
now
are
all
federal
employees
applying
this
salary
basis
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
also
have
a
regulation
saying
the
federal
government
can
dismiss
or
suspend
employees
for
14
days
or
less.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
way
of
discipline.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
here
you're
asserting,
i
guess,
that
because
of
one
instance
involving
one
sergeant
that
all
the
other
people
who
have
never
been
disciplined
fall
under
some
nonexempt
status.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
on
the
basis
of
some
possibly
broader
state
rule
applicab...
or
a
county
rule,
or
police
department
rule
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
what
it
looks
like,
because
it
didn't
happen
to
anybody
else
in
the
numerous
plaintiffs
here,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
have
a
letter,
a
couple
of
letters
from
the
secretary
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--saying
that
the
exemption...
the
exemption
is
lost
as
to
all
employees
only
if
the
employer
engages
in
a
regular
and
recurrent
practice
of
making
impermissible
deductions,
and
the
opinion
we
have
before
us
does
not
find
that
the
police
department
had
a
regular
and
recurring
practice.
it
dealt
only
with
the
one
sergeant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
you
raise
a
lot
of
other
issues,
i
think,
in
your
response,
an
eleventh
amendment
issue,
a
claim
that
the
fsla
does
not
apply
at
all
to
public
employees
of
state
and
local
government,
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
respondents
never
filed
a
cross-petition
here,
did
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
below
assumed
without
deciding
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
applied
to
the
public
employees
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
went
forward
under
that
assumption
the
court--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
we
really
didn't
grant,
as
i
see
it,
on
a
question
of
applicability
of
the
federal
fair
labor
standards
act.
there
was
no
request
made
by
you
in
any
event,
by
a
cross-petition,
that
we
consider
garcia...
reconsider
garcia.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
amici
have
made
that
point,
but
you
did
not
raise
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
assume
that
the
respondents
waived
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
there
might
be
some
cross-petition
to
get
into
these
things.
