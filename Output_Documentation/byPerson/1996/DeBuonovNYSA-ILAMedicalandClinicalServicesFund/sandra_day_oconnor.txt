ms.
smith,
do
you
agree
with
the
outline
offered
by
the
solicitor
general
as
sort
of
a
summary
of
this
court's
holdings
in
this
area?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
adopt
the
same
outline
yourself
without
variation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
construct
a
kind
of
four-part
simple
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
agree
that
all
general
health
laws
that
would
affect
clinic
operations
are
validly
applied
to
an
erisa
health
clinic?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
standards
of
degrees
required
for
people
engaged
in
the
health
care
business,
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
there
might
be
some
disagreement
by
respondents
on
that
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
same
principles
should
govern
whether
a
general
tax
law
or
a
general
state
requirement
for
background
training
or
cleanliness
concerns
or
something
of
that
kind--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
same
principles
govern
the
answer
to
both
questions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
how
would
this
case
come
out,
do
you
think,
under
justice
scalia's
field
preemption
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
the
question
i
asked
you
was,
how
would
the
case
come
out
if
you
were
to
apply
normal
field
preemption
principles
to
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
it
would
have
a
direct
financial
effect.
if
the
erisa
plan
buys
clinic
services
elsewhere
in
new
york,
then
this
tax
is
going
to
be
paid
by
the
entity
that
actually
provides
the
service,
and
so
it
may
in
fact
cost
erisa
something
less,
because
it's
not
paying
the
tax.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
it
were
to
provide
the
services
itself,
then
the
erisa
plan
is
certainly
liable
for
the
full
tax,
so
it
may
end
up
costing
erisa
less
to
contract
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
do
you
think
the
so-called
field
preemption
notice,
the
field
preemption
doctrine
would
play
out
in
these
erisa
cases--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
how
would
that
apply
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
principle
would
explain
most
or
all
of
our
previous
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
is
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
would
field
preemption
play
out
in
the
context
of
direct
state
regulations
going
to
the
educational
background
of
employees
in
the
clinic,
and
cleanliness
requirements,
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
state
requirement
that
anyone
giving
legal
services
has
to
be
a
licensed
attorney?
i
mean,
that
affects
the
cost.
that's
going
to
cost
the
plan
more
if
it's
legal
benefits,
so
you'd
be
back
here
arguing
that,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
my
question
related
not
to
the
tax
but
to
this
sure
knowledge
that
the
state
law
requirement
that
legal
advice
be
given
by
licensed
attorneys
will
cost
more.
it's
going
to
cost
the
erisa
plan,
the
fund,
more
money.
