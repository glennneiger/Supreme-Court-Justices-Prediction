well,
that
refers
to
the
hawaii
exception,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
reference
to
state
tax
laws
refer
to
the
specific
provisions
for
the
hawaiian
plans?

mr.
caruso--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
ask
you
a
different
question?
am
i
right
that
your
argument
assumes
the
definition
of
provide
as
that
word
occurs
in
erisa,
and
i
think
you're
assuming
that
provide
means
provide
in
any
way
or
by
any
means,
whereas
i
would
have
thought
that
provide
means...
in
order
to
have
general
application,
i
would
have
thought
that
provide
meant,
provide
the
means
or
the
funds
for
the
purchase
or
obtaining
of
these
various
kinds
of
benefits,
and
if
it...
if
provide
is
defined
in
the
latter
way,
then
i
take
it
that
would
be
the
end
of
your
argument,
but
perhaps
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
the
definition
were
as
i've
suggested,
then
your
argument
would
fail,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
put
it
crudely,
to
provide
means
to
finance.
if
that
is
what
provide
means
in
erisa,
then
your
argument
would
not...
would
not
get
you
to
victory
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
on
my
theory,
if
we're
going
to
treat
pro...
if
we're
going
to
treat
the
word
provide
as,
in
effect,
synonymous
with
financing,
then
it
would
follow
that
the
taxation
here
is
not
on
the
erisa
plan
as
the
financing
authority
but,
rather,
on
the
erisa
plan
wearing
a
different
hat
in
operating
a
hospital,
and
if
that's
the
way
we
analyze
it,
then
i
take
it
your
argument
would
fail.
