mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
health
facilities
assessment
tax
at
issue
in
this
case
as
applied
to
the
hospitals
owned
by
the
plan
is
not
superseded
by
erisa
under
erisa's
express
preemption
provision.
the
assessment
law
is
a
law
of
general
applicability
that
operates
in
the
field
of
health
care,
a
field
that
this
court
identified
in
travelers
as
one
of
traditional
state
regulation.
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax,
and
in
tax
law
legal
incidence
is
often
very
important,
is
on
hospitals.
the
impact
on
the
plan
is
only
incidental
from
its
capacity
as
the
owner
of
the
hospital.
it
is
not
on
the
plan
in
its
capacity
as
such.
the
assessment
law,
therefore,
does
not
relate
to
the
erisa
plan
at
issue
in
this
case
because
it
does
not
intrude
into
the
field
of
regulation
of
erisa
welfare
benefit
plans
which
section
514(a)
preserves
for
exclusive
federal
regulation.
the
purpose
of
section
514(a)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
this
case,
the
field
preemption
analysis
would
certainly
lead
to
sustaining
the
state
tax,
because
the
state
tax
operates,
again,
in
the
area
of
health
care.
it
operates
with
respect
to
a
facility
owned
by
the
plan.
it
does
not
operate
in
the
field
of
erisa
plans
as
such,
and
therefore
we
think
it
would
not
be
preempted.
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
would
explain
most.
it
would
not
explain
all.
i
agree
with
counsel
for
the
state
that
it
would
not
in
particular
explain
the
mackey
case,
or
not
as
readily.
the
portion--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
portion
of
the
mackey
case
that
held
that
an
express
exemption
from
state
garnishment
laws
for
erisa
plans
was
preempted.
ordinarily,
when
you
have
field
preemption,
if
the
state
enacts
a
law
that
gets
state
law
out
of
the
way
to
secure
the
field
for
federal
occupation,
that
would
ordinarily
not
be
something
that
would
be
preempted
by
field
preemption.
having
said
that,
with
all
respect,
there
is
a
bit
of
an
anomaly
about
having
an
express
exception
for
erisa
plans
in
a
case
like
mackey
preempted
where
the
state
is
trying
to
clear
the
way
for
exclusive
federal
regulation
and
get
out
of
the
way
something
that
is
beneficial
to
a
plan,
not
something
that
just
regulates
it
in
a
more
beneficial
way,
but
removes
state
law
from
the
setting
altogether,
would
not
normally
be
a
problem
with
field
preemption.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i
think
the
court's
more
recent
cases
have
tended
to
focus
on
the
objectives
of
the...
of
erisa,
and
that
can
be
tied,
we
think,
rather
directly
as
a
textual
matter
to
the
field
preemption
argument.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
now,
in
this
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
for
example,
it's
very
important
under
erisa
because
the
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions,
and
we
agree
with
this,
that
erisa
preempts
state
laws
in
some
circumstances
even
where
erisa
itself
does
not
furnish
governing
law,
in
particular
in
the
design
of
erisa
plans
themselves,
what
benefits
to
offer,
who
they
would
be
paid
for,
paid
to,
what
the
amount
of
them
will
be.
even
though
erisa
does
not
dictate
particular
benefit
levels,
its
purpose
was
to
leave
that
to
employers
and
employees
to
negotiate
to
come
up...
to
leave
to
private
ordering,
and
so
state
law
that
would
regulate
the
benefit
structure,
even
though
it
doesn't
conflict
with
any
particular
provision
of
erisa
addressing
that,
would
conflict
with
congress'
purpose
to
insulate
that
from
state
regulation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
that
sense,
under
this,
and
particularly
when
you
have
an
express
preemption
clause,
anything
that
conflicts
with
the
express
preemption
clause.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
or
perhaps
including
the
category
where
the
state
law
would
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
full
accomplishment
of
the
federal
purpose.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
which
affecting
benefit
structure
would,
we
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
and
so
the
sorts
of
things
that
are
occupied
by
the
field,
some
of
them
are
addressed
by
erisa
itself,
but
things
having
to
do
with
the
internal
management
of
the
plan...
benefit
structures,
investment
decisions,
fiduciary
responsibilities,
things
having
to
do
with
the
way
the
administrator
handles
the
plan...
and
with
respect
to
those
things,
we
think
the
things
that
the
state
can't
regulate
it
ordinarily
can't
tax.
the
things
that
the
state
can
regulate
the
state
ordinarily
can
tax,
and
it's
instructive
that
subsection
b5(b)i,
which
was
part
of
a
special
provision
adopted
for
the
hawaii
health
care
plan,
specifically
says
that
the
exemption
for
that
does
not
affect
state
tax
laws
as
they
may
relate
to
erisa
plans,
and
the
background
and
structure
of
that
shows,
we
think,
that
congress
intended
that
state
tax
laws
be
treated
generally
as...
the
same
way
that
regulation
is
and,
after
all,
tax
is
a
species
of
regulation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
to
that,
they
would
not
be
preempted
because
they
do
not
address
the
internal
affairs
of
an
erisa
plan
as
such
in
its
capacity
as
a
plan
with
respect
to
funding,
and
financing,
and
what
services
will
be
paid
for.
such
a
state
law
regulates
the
services
that
are
in
turn
either
purchased
or
furnished
in
kind
by
the
erisa
plan,
so
under
that
view
of
field
preemption
what
the...
the
field
the
state
is
in
is
substantive
health
care
regulation,
licensing
of
the
facility
and
what-not.
and
in
general,
the
distinction
that
justice
breyer
made
we
would
agree
with,
and
it
was
essentially
our
position
in
travelers
as
well
that
where
the
erisa
plan
steps
out
of
its
internal
management
of
plan
structure
and
purchases
something
in
the
market,
either
pencils
for
the
office
or
services
in
kind,
state
substantive
regulation
or
taxation
of
a...
a
sales
tax
for
purchasing
something
wouldn't
be
preempted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think
it
would
have
to
pay,
for
example,
unemployment
compensation
taxes
that...
for
its
employees.
we
think,
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
state
tried
to
tax
the
income
to
the
plan
itself,
which
is
a
species
perhaps
of
regulating
the
corpus
of
the
trust
funds,
if
there's
a
separate
trust
fund,
if
the
state
tries
to
regulate
the
corpus
of
the
trust
by
regulating
investment
decisions,
we
think
that's
at
the
core
of
what
erisa
would
not
allow,
and
therefore
it
may
well
be
that
the
state
could
not
tax
the
corpus
of
the
trust
itself.
but
where
the
state
is
leaving...
or
the
trust,
the
plan
is
leaving
its
internal
operations
and
going
out
into
the
marketplace
by
hiring
employees
or
purchasing
goods
and
services,
including
services
in
kind
that
are
paid
for
by
the
erisa
plan--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
state
could
regulate
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
would...
it's
that
point
we
think
that
may
make
that
a
closer
question,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
decide
that
question
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
congress
intended
to
preserve
the
assets
in
the
fund
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees,
but
we
think
that
that
could
also
be
a
species
of
field
preemption,
because
the
state
could
not
directly
regulate
investment
decisions
by
holding
fiduciaries
to
different
standards
or
requiring
diversification
requirements
in
the
portfolio.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would,
i
think,
refer
to
whether
the
state
law
is
addressing
the
erisa
plan
as
an
erisa
plan,
in
its
capacity
as
an
erisa
plan,
not
when
it
is
purchasing
goods
and
services
outside
of
the
plan's
operations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it's
the
former
that's
the
field.
