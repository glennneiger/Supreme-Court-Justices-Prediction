ms.
m.
patricia
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
state
laws
of
general
applicability
relate
to
erisa
plans
only
when
they
both
operate
upon
a
plan
in
its
capacity
as
a
plan,
and
when
the
effect
of
that
law
is
to
dictate
or
restrict
and
not
merely
influence
plan
choice.
the
health
facility
assessment,
a
gross
receipts
tax
imposed
upon
hospitals
in
new
york,
does
not
relate
to
erisa
plans
which
operate
their
own
hospitals
because
neither
of
these
elements
is
present.
the
impact
of
the
hfa
upon
plans
is
no
more
than
that
of
the
laws
that
were
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
blue
cross
v.
travelers
case
and
the
court's
recent
opinion
in
california
v.
dillingham.
like
those
laws,
the
hfa
does
not
dictate
or
restrict
plan
choice.
like
the
surcharges
in
travelers,
the
hfa
may
have
an
economic
impact
upon
a
plan's
cost
of
providing
benefits.
this
impact
may
occur
regardless
of
whether
plans
own
their
own
hospitals
or
purchase
hospital
care
services
from
third
parties.
in
either
case,
the
economic
impact
of
the
law
is
not
enough
to
make
the
law
relate
to
plans.
notwithstanding
the
fund's
ownership
of
the
hospital
in
this
case,
the
hfa
also
does
not
relate
to
the
plan
because
it
operates
upon
the
fund
not
in
its
capacity
as
a
plan
but
as
a
provider
of
medical
services.
the
hfa
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
state
regulation
of
hospitals,
and
the
provision
of
medical
services
is
not
a
plan
function
which
erisa
preemption
was
designed
to
protect.
when
plans
choose
to
provide
the
types
of
benefits
which
are
not
strictly
financial
but
which
involve
services,
those
services
remain
subject
to
generally
applicable
state
regulation
whether
plans
purchase
those
services
from
third
parties
or
choose
to
provide
those
services
in
kind.
the
operation
of
a
hospital,
like
the
operation
of
a
day
care
center,
the
practice
of
law,
and
employees'
training
programs,
are
not
plan
functions--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor,
the
outline
of
this...
what
this
court
has
decided--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--yes.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes,
your
honor.
where
we
differ
from
the
solicitor
is
not
necessarily
in
outcome
but
somewhat
in
analysis.
in
this
case,
the
respondents,
who
would
agree
that
many
generally
applicable
laws
would
not
relate
to
them
even
if
they
were
imposed
directly
upon
them,
respondents
claim
that
this
case
is
different
because
when
you
operate
your
own
hospital
you're
acting
as
a
provider
of
medical
services,
which
they
say
is
what
an
erisa
plan
is
meant
to
do.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
absolutely,
your
honor.
when
the
state
is
regulating
generally
in
the
health
care
area,
those
are
areas
of
traditional
state
concern.
if
erisa
plans
choose
to
operate
in
those
areas,
they
take
basically
the
marketplace
as
the
state
is
regulating
the
marketplace
of
those
areas.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
the
respondents'
argument
is
that
at
least
in
the
health
care
area,
but
i
think
that
their
theory
is
equally
applicable
to
those
other
four
benefit
areas
that
involve
services...
day
care,
prepaid
legal
services,
and
apprenticeship
training...
that
when
plans
operate
in
those
areas,
the
state
may
not
regulate
them.
at
least,
they
may
not
tax
them,
i
believe
is
the
respondents'
argument.
our
disagreement
is
that
in
those
areas,
those
services
remain
subject
to
state
regulation.
one
looks
at
the
plan
as--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--in
these--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--in
these
service
areas...
in
these
service
areas,
yes,
so
a
generally
applicable
health
care
tax,
a
generally
applicable
day
care
tax,
or
in
these
four
service
areas,
whether,
if
you
can
regulate
in
those
areas
in
a
generally
applicable
way
you
can
tax
in
those
areas
in
a
generally
applicable
way.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
justice
scalia,
the
way
that
the
court
has
formulated
preemption
analysis
to
date,
there
are
two
prongs.
there's
the
refer-to
prong,
as
the
court
refers
to
it,
and
the
connection
prong.
what
the
relates-to
analysis
does
to
date
is
that
if
you
had
general
preemption
provisions,
conflict-of-field
preemption
provisions,
a
state
law
which
referred
to
erisa
plan
which
kept
them
out
of
those
fields
would
not
be
preempted.
but
to
date,
the...
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
law
which
specifically
refers
to
erisa
plans,
even
if
it
gives
erisa
plans
better
protection...
for
instance,
in
the
mackey
case
the
part
of
the
law
that
required
the
state
garnishment
law
not
to
apply
to
erisa
plans
this
court
held
was
preempted,
so--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--my
understanding
of
field
preemption,
your
honor,
is
that
a
state
law
that
specifically
kept
whatever
was
being
regulated
out
of
the
field
would
not
be
preempted.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
right.
for
instance,
if
it
was
a
question
of
nuclear
safety
and
the
law
said
something
about
state,
whatever...
and
you
can't
be
in
the
nuclear
safety
area,
that
that
would
not
be
preempted.
that
is
my
understanding
of
field
preemption.
but
in
this
case,
when
the
state
garnishment
law
says
erisa
plans
are
not
subject
to
the
garnishment
law,
this
court
has
held
that
because
it
specifically
referred
to
and
applied
only
to
erisa
plans,
it
was
not
preempted...
it
was
preempted,
sorry.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
do
agree
with
the
government's
outline.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor,
we
are
asking
the
court
basically,
in
making
this
distinction
between
services
and
plans,
to
carve
out--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--it
would
come
out
that
this
law
does
not
relate
to
plans
because
the
service
area
is
outside
the
field
of
employee
benefit
plans,
that
while
employee
benefit
plans
are
concerned
with
the
funding
and
payment
of
benefits,
that
the
services
which
those
benefit
payments
may
fund,
the
quantity
of
the
services,
the
quality
of
the
services,
the
availability
of
the
services,
are
not
an
area
with
which
erisa
is
concerned
with.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
that
distinction
works
very
well,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
are
claiming
that
they're
not
buying
anything.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
right,
but--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--but
basically
that
is
the
distinction
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
draw.
most
erisa
benefits
are
strictly
financial.
it's
money
and
the
contingency
upon.
pension
benefits,
money
and
the
contingency
of
retirement.
death
benefits
and
the
contingency
of
death.
there
are
only
four
erisa
benefits
that
actually
involve
services.
in
other
words,
services
that
plans
may
buy,
and
that
would
be
day
care,
apprenticeship
training,
prepaid
legal
services,
and
health--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--no,
your
honor,
not
in
our
view.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
no,
your
honor,
not
in
our
view,
because
in
general,
again,
we're
dealing
with
a
very
limited
area
of
erisa
benefits
that
actually
involve
something
that
the
plan
purchases
as
opposed
to
money
that
the
plan
is
giving,
and
when
erisa
plans
are
operating
as
ordinary
commercial
entities,
they
may
well
purchase
services.
they
may
purchase...
they
may
purchase,
you
know,
fiduciary
services.
they
may
purchase
stationery.
they
may
purchase
whatever,
and
clearly
we
don't
think
that
anyone
would
contest
that
when
they're
operating
in
those
commercial
capacities,
purchasing
those
entities,
that
erisa
preemption
would
apply.
whether
you--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
you
could
also
look
at
this
when
an
erisa
plan
provides
services
in
kind,
they're
simply
purchasing
them
in
a
different
way.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
instead
of
purchasing
them
from
a
third
party,
they
are
directly
purchasing
them
from
the
doctors
and--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--your
honor--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--your
honor,
in
this
case
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
not
on
the
erisa
plan
but
on
the
hospital
which,
although
it's
not
critical
to
my
argument,
is
a
separately
incorporated
corporation.
the
hospital
can,
like
any
other
entity,
determine
how
it's
going
to
fund
the
tax.
it
could
pass
it
on
to
its
customers,
in
this
case,
the
erisa
plan
participants,
in
higher
copays.
in
this
particular
case,
it
could
decide
to
pass
it
on
to
its
other
customers,
the
other
plans
that
have
services
there,
or
the
worker's
comp
carriers,
or
the
fund
could
pay
it.
it's
really
no
different
than
if
it's
mount
sinai
that's
paying
the
tax.
in
this
case,
it's
not
the
fund
that's
paying
the
tax,
or
that
has
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
it's
the
medical
centers
themselves.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor,
in
those
cases
you're
impacting
upon
what
the
fund
is
paying,
what
services,
as
opposed
to
the
services
themselves.
so,
for
instance,
the
state
of
new
york
can
regulate
surgery,
and
it
could
say,
there's
too
much
surgery
in
the
state
of
new
york.
no
one
can
have
surgery
unless
there's
a
second
opinion.
what
the
court...
what
the
state
can't
say
is,
and
anyone
who
pays
for
the
surgery
must
also
pay
for
the
second
opinion,
because
you're
dealing
with
coverage
issues:
what
is
a
plan
paying
for,
as
opposed
to
what
services
are
available
in
the
marketplace.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor,
the
hfa
is
not
a
tax
on
benefit
contributions.
it's
a
tax
on
hospital
receipts.
the
characterization
is
equally
applicable
to
any
time
a
plan
purchases
services
from
any
hospital,
so
when
mount
sinai,
a
private,
nonplan-owned
hospital,
receives
benefit
payments
from
any
other
plan,
mount
sinai
can
claim
we
can't
pay
the
hfa
because
the
plan
made
these
payments.
it's
a
contribution,
and
therefore
it's
a
tax
on
plan
contributions.
while
to
the
plan
that
makes
the
payments
when
they're
purchasing
services,
whether
it's
health
care
services
or
day
care
services,
it
may
represent
a
benefit
payment,
to
the
taxed
entity,
to
the
hospital,
to
the
day
care
center,
it
is
simply
income.
secondly,
in
these
service
areas,
if
you
can
regulate
these
entities,
you
should
tax
them,
you
should
be
able
to
tax
them,
because
erisa
makes
no
distinction
in
its
preemption
provision
between
regulatory
laws
and
tax
laws.
with
or
without
the
hawaii
prepaid
legal
services...
i
mean,
sorry,
the
hawaii
prepaid...
yes,
health
service
exemption,
state
tax
laws
are
treated
the
same.
they
are
relate...
they
are
preempted
only
if
they
relate-to,
and
the
state's
argument
is
in
these
service
areas
you
may
regulate
without
regard
to
erisa
plans,
and
therefore
you
may
tax
in
these
areas
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
erisa
plans
are
purchasing
services
in
these
areas.
finally,
your
honor,
outside
of
these
service
areas
the
tax
issue
is
a
complicated
one,
and
one
which
is
really
not
fully
addressed
in
these
briefs.
for
instance,
the
notion
that
erisa
plans
are
carte
blanche
exempt
from
federal
and
state
taxation
is
simply
not
correct.
i
would
urge
you
in
this
case
not
to
get
into
a
general
tax
analysis,
and
the
state
itself
is
limiting
its
argument
to
the
purchase
of
services
and
the
taxing
of
services
in
these
areas
which
are
matters
of
traditional
state
concerns.
it's
not
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
states
can
tax
the
corpus
of
trusts.
those
are...
present
different
and
perhaps
more
complicated
issues.
