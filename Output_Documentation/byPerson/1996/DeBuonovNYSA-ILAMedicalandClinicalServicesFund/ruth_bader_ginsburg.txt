justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
do
i
understand
that...
you
said
you
agreed
with
the
government's
outline
as
a
summary
of
what
this
court
has
held,
that
however
you
might
wish
justice
scalia's
concurring
opinion
in
the
dillingham
case
to
be
speaking
for
the
majority,
the
majority
has
not
yet
spoke
that
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
want
to
draw
a
line...
the
difference
between
buying
the
service,
because
i
think
this
is
a
case
where
the
plan
itself
is
providing
it,
so
i
think
in
your
brief
you
try
to
look
at
the
other
side
of
it
and
say
when
you're
talking
about
plan
funding,
plan
administration,
that's
what
erisa
covers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
else
besides
sales
tax?
what
taxes
does
an
erisa
plan
have
to
bear?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
the
sales
tax
on
items
that
the
fund
uses
to
operate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
the
plan
is
operating
a
private
hospital,
why
shouldn't
it
be
treated
like
any
other
hospital?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
other
benefits
that
a
plan
might
provide,
like
legal
services?
do
you
say
the
same
thing
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
do
agree
that
the
plan-operated
medical
center
would
be
subject
to
regulations,
the
state
qualifications
for
physicians,
for
staff
people--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
i
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
don't
see
which,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
we
take
out
your
tax
reference
and
say,
we
read
that
as
discrete
to
this
special
hawaii
situation
so
please
concentrate
on
the
statute
without
that
provision,
then
what
is
your
distinction
between
the
tax--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
i'm
asking
you
to
do
that.
and
now
distinguish
for
me
the
taxation
from
the
regulation,
without
the
special
reference
to
taxation
that
you
find.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
can't
just
be
that
it's
getting
money
from
the
state,
from...
and
putting
it
into
the
state's
coffers,
because
you've
already
said
unemployment
compensation,
sales
tax,
that's
all
okay,
even
though
that
comes
out
of
the
corpus.
