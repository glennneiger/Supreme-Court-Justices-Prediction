mr.
donato
caruso
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
state
tax
on
the
corpus
of
the
fund.
what's
being
taxed
are
the
contributions
that
are
being
paid
to
the
fund
by
the
employers
required
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
make
those
contributions,
and
benefit
payments
being
made
for
the
benefits
that
the
erisa
fund
is
paying,
so
this
case
involves
a
tax.
there's
a
clear
indication
in
the
legislation
itself
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
erisa
that
congress
intended
tax...
state
tax
laws
to
enjoy
no
charmed
existence.
they
were
to
be
treated
like
any
other
law,
any
other
state
law
that
relates
to
a
plan.
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
when
the
fund
is
being
required
to
pay
a
state
assessment
on
the
very
activities
that
makes
the
fund
a
fund,
the
very
health
care
benefits
that
the
fund
is
paying
out,
the
contributions
that
the
employers
are
paying
for
those
benefits,
i
submit
to
you
that
it's
self-evident
that
the
tax
in
this
case
relates
to
the
fund.
mr.
donato
caruso
i
think
in
that
case
the
fund
is
actually
acting
not
as
a
fund
but
as
a
purchaser.
what
we're
saying
there
is,
we
would
tend
to
agree
that
if
you
use
the
concept
that
was
first
developed
i
believe
in
the
shaw
case,
the
tenuous,
remote,
and
peripheral
concept,
that
when
the
plan
is
acting
in
a
capacity
that
any
other
private
entity
would
be
involved
in,
then
the
plan
is
to
be
treated
like
any
other
private
entity.
mr.
donato
caruso
because
a
plan
does
provide
benefits.
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
erisa,
erisa
says
that
any
plan
or
program
to
provide
health
benefits
through
insurance
or
otherwise,
and
the
erisa
definition--
mr.
donato
caruso
--well,
if
the
plan
is
providing
legal
services
and
there's
been
a
tax
imposed
on
the
contributions
that
the
plan
is
providing
to
the
attorneys
who
are
providing
the
services,
i
would
say
yes,
that
that
tax
would
be
preempted,
because
that
tax
is
being
imposed
on
the
very
activities
that
make
the
plan
a
plan.
mr.
donato
caruso
well,
obviously
that's
not
the
case
that
we
have
here
today,
but
we're
not
looking
at
it
from
a
cost
standpoint,
justice
o'connor.
what
we're
saying
is,
look
at
the
activity.
what
we're
saying
is,
if
you're
buying
pencils,
you're
a
purchaser.
you
can
impose
the
sales
tax.
if
you're
engaging
in
employing
individuals
as
part
of
your
operations
of
the
clinic
and
there
are
employment
taxes
to
be
paid,
well,
you
are
an
employer.
you're
not
a
plan.
but
when
you're
providing
benefits,
and
it's
the
contributions
for
those
benefits
that
the
state
is
taxing,
we
say
there,
there
you
are
taxing
the
plan
as
a
plan.
mr.
donato
caruso
we
would
say,
and
the
probabilities
are
in
that
situation,
if
you
look
at
the
structure
and
objectives
and
erisa,
that
there
probably
was
not
an
indication
of
congressional
intent,
as
there
was
in
the
travelers
case,
that
congress
intended
erisa
to
preempt
that
type
of
regulation,
and
in
this
case
we
have
explicit
language
in
the
statute
that
says
state
tax
laws,
they
don't
have
a
charmed
existence.
we
want
them
treated
like
anything
else.
mr.
donato
caruso
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter.
mr.
donato
caruso
i
think
it
refers
to
the
hawaiian
plan,
but
what
it
says
is,
it
kind
of
mirrors
the
language
of
the
preemption
clause
and
says
state
tax
laws
that
relate
to
plans
shall
not...
shall
be
preempted,
in
essence.
i'm
paraphrasing.
and
i
think
the
concern
there
was
that
the
hawaii...
the
dispensation
for
the
hawaii
plan
might
have
created
some
indications
that
there
were
certain
tax
aspects
of
the
hawaii
plan,
that
in
fact
hawaii
in
some
prior
litigation
involving
a
prototype
of
its
plan
had
taken
the
position
that
the
state
enactment
there
was
a
tax,
and
therefore
there
was
some
tenth
amendment
protection.
there's
some
indication
then
that
congress
was
specifically
concerned
about
the
approach
being
taken
by
hawaii
in
this
prior
litigation
and
saw
the
need
to
point
out,
as
it
did
in
1974
when
it
rejected
the
executive
branch's
request
that
state
tax
laws
be
exempted
from
the
preemption
provision,
that
they
should
not
have
any
charmed
existence--
mr.
donato
caruso
--that
they
should
be
treated
like
any
other
law.
mr.
donato
caruso
of
course,
i
disagree
with
your
definition
because
i
think
the
term
otherwise
was
being
used.
otherwise
has
a
very
broad
meaning.
mr.
donato
caruso
then
i
take
it
you
would
be
saying
that
the
tax
is
being
imposed
not
on
the
plan
but
on
a
hospital.
mr.
donato
caruso
i'm
afraid
i'm
not...
i
don't
feel
that
i
can
concede
that
point,
because
i
think
what
congress
was
saying
is
that
they
have
structured
a
system
of
national
tax
exemption.
it's
very
clear,
erisa
plans
are
not
subject
to
taxation
under
the
federal
system,
and
i
think
what
was
intended
by
the
legislative
history
was,
there
was
an
indication
by
congress
that
we're
going
to
not
allow
the
states
to
tax--
mr.
donato
caruso
--i
mean,
that's
one
way
to
look
at
it,
but
the
way
i
look
at
it,
if
congress
said
that
a
state
law
that...
a
state
tax
law
that
relates
to
a
plan
is
preempted,
and
the
plan
is
the
party
that's
paying
that
tax
on
the
activities
that
make
it
a
plan,
then
i
would
submit
that
if
this
type
of
law
is
not
preempted,
i
don't
know
what
other
type
of
tax--
mr.
donato
caruso
--that...
we
would
take
the
position
that
that
doesn't
involve
the
activities
of
the
plan
as
a
plan.
mr.
donato
caruso
right,
but
it's
not--
mr.
donato
caruso
--but
it
isn't
buying
it
here.
i
mean,
there
seems
to
be
this
understanding
on
the
part--
mr.
donato
caruso
--but
when...
a
travel
agency
may
have
one
point,
but
in
the
case
of
a
clinic
that
we
operate,
this
is
not
like
a
commercial
clinic.
we
don't
open
this
clinic
to
the
public.
we're
limiting
these
operations
only
to
our
erisa-covered
participants.
mr.
donato
caruso
well,
we're
getting
into
the
other
area
where
we
get
into
the--
mr.
donato
caruso
--i
would
say
no,
because
there's
a...
there's
the
deemer
clause
in
erisa
itself
which
says
that
the
state
may
not
consider
an
erisa
plan
an
insurance
company
for
purposes
of
insurance
regulation,
so
this
issue
here
where--
mr.
donato
caruso
--it's
where
your...
there
is
insurance
regulation
that
the
state
is
trying
to
apply
to
the
fund
as
an
insurer.
it's
taking
the
position,
well,
this
is
really
insurance
regulation,
and
i
think
congress
has
specifically
said
in
that
situation
when
you're
the
direct
provider
of
insurance,
in
essence--
mr.
donato
caruso
--you've
got
a
different
status--
mr.
donato
caruso
--as
opposed
to
going
out
and
purchasing
it.
mr.
donato
caruso
well,
in
the
insurance
area--
mr.
donato
caruso
--in
the
insurance
area
they
specifically
say
insurance
regulation.
mr.
donato
caruso
right.
mr.
donato
caruso
i
understand
that.
they
didn't
do
it
there
because
congress
didn't
envision
that
a
state
was
going
to
be
taxing
the
operations
of
a
plan
when
the
plan
was
directly
providing
services
as
a
plan.
there
was
no
need
for
it
to
say
that
we
have
to
deem
it
not
to
be
a
hospital,
because
a
plan
is
a
hospital.
and
i
understand
that
under
justice
souter's
definition
that
if
provide
means
only
to
finance,
then
i
think
perhaps
the
result
would
be
different,
but
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
the
word
otherwise
allows
plans
to
do
more
than
just
pay
insurance
or
provide
financing,
but
rather
to
actually
engage
in
the
provision
of
the
services
directly.
mr.
donato
caruso
we're
not
suggesting
otherwise.
i
mean,
again,
it's
not
our
case.
it
hasn't
arisen
yet.
maybe
it's
an
area
that
may
have
to
be
addressed
at
some
later
time
to
see
whether
erisa
can
be
read
to
indicate
that
congress
had
an
intent
to
restrict
regulation
in
that
area.
mr.
donato
caruso
i
can't
see
it.
mr.
donato
caruso
i
don't
see
it.
mr.
donato
caruso
i
do
not
see
that
anything
in
erisa
would
suggest
that
the
state
could
not
exercise
its
traditional
police
powers
in
regulating
health
care
service.
what
i
say
here
is,
though,
that
when
i
look
at
erisa
there
is
a
specific
provision
on
taxation.
what
i'm
saying,
when
the
tax
is
being
imposed
on
the
plan
when
the
plan
is
engaging
in
hospital--
mr.
donato
caruso
--i
would
hope
you
wouldn't
do
that,
because
i
think
if
you
looked
in
1974,
the
executive
branch
actually
went
to
congress
and
said
to
congress--
mr.
donato
caruso
--well,
i
think
there's
a
direct
relationship
when
the
fund
is
being
asked
to
take
some
of
its
assets
and
provide
those
assets
to
the
state,
to
the
state's
general
coffers.
i
don't
think
erisa
intended
that
type
of
state
imposition
on
erisa
plans.
i
mean,
it's
just
contrary
to
the
whole
structure
of
tax
exemption--
mr.
donato
caruso
--i
agree
with
you.
what
i'm
saying,
when
it's
being
imposed
on
the
fund's
contributions
and
benefit
plans,
not
on
it's
incidental
activities
in
providing
the
services,
and
i
think
if
you
take
the
position...
what
i'm
particularly
concerned
about
is
if
we're
going
to
slice
it
that
thin,
that
what's
to
prevent
the
states
from
taxing
the
income
of
the
funds,
from
tax...
if
they're
allowed
to
tax
the
contributions,
that's
the
corpus.
i
mean--
mr.
donato
caruso
--well,
if
you
took
that
approach,
then
that's
what
saying,
that--
mr.
donato
caruso
--if
erisa...
an
erisa
plan
cannot
be
defined
as
the
direct
provider.
that's
what
you're
in
essence
saying,
that
it
really
becomes
the
hospital,
even
though
becoming
the
hospital
is
what
an
erisa
plan
is
supposed
to
do.
mr.
donato
caruso
it
does
that
on
occasion.
mr.
donato
caruso
in
that
situation
then
it
would
be
treated
like
other
buyers.
mr.
donato
caruso
because
congress
has
done
it
that
way,
and
i
think
you'll
find
that
if
you
look
at
the
metropolitan
life
case,
that
the
same
type
of
special
status
was
given
to
self-insured
plans.
mr.
donato
caruso
correct.
mr.
donato
caruso
correct.
mr.
donato
caruso
that's
correct.
mr.
donato
caruso
that
is
correct.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
