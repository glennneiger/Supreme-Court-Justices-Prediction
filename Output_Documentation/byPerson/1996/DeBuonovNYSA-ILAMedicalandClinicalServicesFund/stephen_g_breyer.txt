justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
does
it
work
to
distinguish
that
which
is
doing
the
providing,
namely
the
plan,
and
that
which
the
plan
buys,
like
the
services?
i
mean,
that
distinction
seems
to
run
throughout
the
cases,
but
for
the
area
of
pensions
itself,
where
the
fund
is
basically
writing
a
check,
so
it's
quite
closely
tied
up
with
the
fund.
but
in
the
benefits
area,
they're
buying
something,
so
is
it
the
case...
how
does
that
distinction
work
between
the
plan
itself...
this
is
another
case
in
which
we've...
other
cases
have
tried
to
make
the
same
distinction.
the
government's
tended
to
resist
it,
i
think...
and
that
which
the
plan
buys.
when
you
get
to
that
which
the
plan
buys,
there's
no
field
preemption.
rather,
you
look
bit-by-bit
to
see
if
that
which
the
plan
buys
and
the
state's
regulating
that
conflicts
specifically
with
the
purpose
of
congress.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
that
just
happens
to
be
because
they
went
and
supplied
it
themselves.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
just
an
artifact
of
the
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you've
really
looked
into
this
a
lot,
and
so
what
i'm
quite
serious
is...
if
there
were
some
words
in
an
opinion
that
said
when
you
look
into
that
area
which,
when
you
look
into
those
things
which
the
plan
buys,
as
opposed
to
the
management
of
a
trust,
when
you
look
into
that
area,
normally
there
is
no
preemption
unless
the
state
law
conflicts
with
a
purpose
of
congress,
and
a
rather
specific
purpose
at
that.
now,
would
that
cause
trouble?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
in
this
case
it
wouldn't
but
i
mean,
in
your
experience
in
general
would
it
cause
trouble?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
i
run
into,
you
know,
with
my
own
thought
there
is,
i
run
into
a
problem.
i
mean,
i
can
easily
say,
let's
distinguish
what's
normally
bought,
even
though
in
your
case
it
happens
to
be
provided,
from
the
running
of
the
fund,
and
let's
say
in
the
former
situation
and
grouping
your
case
with
the
former,
normally
there
is
no
preemption
unless
you
find
a
specific
conflict.
then
i
run
into
these...
the
benefit
cases
where
the
fund
was
buying
certain
medical
benefits,
really,
and
the
court
said
no,
it's
preempted
where
you
have
the
pregnancy...
you
know,
the
certain
rules
on
what
you
can
buy
or
not
buy,
which
were
really
regulations
of
what
was
bought,
rather
than
regulations
of
the
fund,
so
how
do
you
work
with
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
field
preemption?
that
is
to
say,
i've
never
fully
understood
this.
if
a
state
passes
a
law,
and
it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
a
federal
statute
that
the
state
not
pass
this
kind
of
law,
then
it's
preempted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
called
conflict
preemption,
or
field
preemption?
i
mean,
in
the
instance
when
there
is
no
direct
conflict,
i
mean,
isn't
it
in
both
instances
a
question
of
looking
to
the
purpose
of
congress
and
seeing
if
this
is
the
kind
of
law
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
that's
right,
then
if
you
use
the
word
field
preemption,
what
will
it
do
in
general?
how
should
it
be
used?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
just
why...
that's
exactly
why
i'm
nervous
about
the
words,
field
preemption,
because
in
trying
to
work
out
what
the
field
is
you
have
to
make
roughly
the
same
analysis
that
you'd
have
to
make
on
purpose.
do
you
have
a
use
of
the
word,
field?
i
mean,
if
we
were
to
use
the
word
field
preemption,
how
would
you
use
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
if
they
have
a
travel
bureau,
if
they
decide
in
the...
the
erisa
plan
decides
to
set
up
its
own
travel
agent
to
arrange
for
employee
vacations,
and
there's
a
uniform
tax
in
the
state
on
travel
agents,
it
doesn't
have
to
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why...
so
if
they
have
to
pay
that
if
they
set
up
a
travel
bureau
to
arrange
for
employee
vacations,
why
do
they
have
to...
how
do
they
get
out
of
paying
when
they
set
up
a
hospital
to
provide
the
employee
medical
treatment?
in
both
cases
it's
something
that
a
plan
normally
buys--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--from
others,
but
in
this
particular
instance
it
provides
it
itself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
isn't
buying
it
with
the
travel
agent
either.
it's
their
own
travel
agent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
line,
i
think,
that
they
want
to
draw,
the
government,
is
to
say,
distinguish
between,
in
the
benefit
area,
that
which
does
the
buying,
namely
the
plan,
and
that
which
is
bought,
namely,
the
benefits,
and
in
the
case
where
you're
talking
about
the
latter,
by
and
large
you
can
impose
uniform
taxes,
and
if
it
turns
out
that
in
a
particular
instance
the
former,
namely
that
which
does
the
buying,
itself
decides
to
provide
that
which
is
normally
bought,
it's
treated
as
if
it
bought
it.
now,
that's
a
clear
line.
it's
administrable.
it...
you
take
away
your
horror
cases
by
saying,
fine,
if
they
provide
a
horror
tax,
that's
different,
and
what
line
would
you
provide?
i
mean,
you
see,
that's
the
virtue
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
don't
always...
they
don't
necessarily...
the
erisa
plan
i
take
it
in
many
instances
buys
hospital
care
from
others.
it
doesn't
often--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
why...
but
if
you
take
your
position,
then
what
you
do
is,
you
simply
get
the
erisa
plans
themselves,
through
a
real
tax
advantage,
to
start
going
into
the
businesses
of
providing
those
things
which
normally
would
be
bought
from
others,
and
they'd
get
a
tax
break.
why?
why
would
congress
want
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
actual
answer,
if
you
happen
to
have
an
erisa
plan
that
bought
paid
vacations
for
its
employees,
and
they
decide
to
go
into
the
travel
business
limited
to
employees,
the
answer
then
to
the
question
is,
they're
tax
exempt,
right,
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
