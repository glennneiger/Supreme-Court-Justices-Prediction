ms.
smith,
i
don't
understand
what
you
think
the
effect
of
the
very
broad
language,
relates
to,
is.
what
does
it
bring
to
this
enterprise
that
we're
engaging
in
that
wouldn't
be
affected
by
our
ordinary
preemption
principles?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
normal
field
preemption,
isn't
it,
that
you
cannot...
you
can
neither
reduce
nor
increase
the
protection
that
the
federal
government
gives.
that's
what
normal
field
preemption
would
produce.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean.
what...
that
kept
whatever
was
being
regulated
out
of
the
field?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
there...
is
it
not
fair
to
say
that
there
is
also
some
inconsistency
in
our
expression
of
the
rule
we
were
applying
in
the
earlier
cases
as
compared
with
the
expression
that
we've
used
in
the
last
few?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
broad
sense,
mr.
kneedler,
i
suppose
any
preemption
involves
a
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
preemption
is
conflict
preemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
in
our
cases
what
conflict
preemption
meant
was,
where
an
inconsistent
obligation
is
placed
upon
the
regulated
party.
if
the
federal
government
tells
you
to
do
x,
and
the
state
tells
you
to
do
not
x--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
a
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
i
thought
we've
said
field
preemption
would
apply
where
the
federal
law
tells
you
to
do
x,
and
the
state
law
says
do
x
plus
10,
which
wouldn't...
you're
doing
x,
but
you're
doing
more
than
x.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
government
wanted
this
thing
to
be
complete,
and
we're
occupying
the
field,
you're
not
supposed
to
address
this
area
at
all,
x
plus
10
would
be
preempted.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
field
preemption
or
conflict
preemption?
would
you...
if
you
feel
it
couldn't
be
taxed,
wouldn't
that
be
because
you
think
that
there
is
an
indication
in
the
legislation
that
congress
did
not
want
it
taxed?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
caruso,
it
says
through
insurance
or
otherwise.
suppose
your
plan
decided
to
provide
its
health
benefits
through
insurance,
and
instead
of
buying
insurance
from
anybody,
it
ran
its
own
insurance
company.
would
state
insurance
laws
not
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
exactly
parallel.
through
insurance
or
otherwise.
you're
doing
it
otherwise,
and
you
say
since
we're
doing
it
otherwise,
the
state
laws
that
regulate
the
otherwise
don't
apply.
suppose
you
did
it
through
insurance?
would
the
state
laws
governing
insurance
apply?
you
became
your
own
insurance
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
wouldn't
have
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
the
deemer
clause
put
in
the
statute
if,
as
you
tell
us,
it
is
clear
from
the
general
preemption
provision
that
if
you're
providing
insurance
directly
you
can't
be
regulated,
just
as
if
you're
providing
otherwise
directly
you
can't
be
regulated?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
envisioned
insurance,
but
they
said
elsewhere
in
the
statute
the
states
aren't
going
to
regulate
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
an
insurer,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
about
the
otherwise?
the
otherwise
is
hospitals.
that's
the
most
obvious
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
say
in
a
deemer
clause,
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
a
hospital.
