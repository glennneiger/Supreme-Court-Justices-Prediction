justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
would
not,
as
i
understand
it,
be
a
decree
that
would
estop
the
state
if
the
state
later
wanted
to
contest
the
title.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
think
the
state
would
suffer
preclusion
from
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
in
one
sense
it's
always
impossible
to
separate
the
officer
from
the
state,
but
that's
what
ex
parte
young
does,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
the
state's
ultimate
fear
would
be
that
if...
if
it
had
an
ultimate
fear,
is
that
if
the
officers
lost
the
suit,
that
the
state
would
lose
its
title,
and
i
would
have
thought
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
very
nature
of
the
eleventh
amendment
claim
that
the
state
had,
that
there
would
be
no
issue
preclusion
against
the
state
if
the
state
either
later
wished
voluntarily
to
litigate
its
question
of
title,
or
was
sued
in
a
state
court
for
that
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
it's
the
quiet
title
act
that
would
in
effect
require
the
preclusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
not
the
only
way
the
state
could
perfect
its
title,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
can't
you
say
in
any
case
in
which
a
state
officer
suffers
an
injunction,
that
the
state
officer
is
thereby
deflected
from
performing
duties
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
state
would
be
better
performed
either
for
some
other
purpose,
for
the
purpose
that
it...
that
the...
that
was
enjoined,
and
that
there
is
always
a
kind
of
frustration
of
state
activity
as
a
result
of
it,
and
i
don't...
for
that
reason,
i
don't
see
why
there
is
some
peculiar
status
of
lands,
even
when
the
state
has
a
sovereign
purpose
in
holding
the
lands.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
right
to
exercise
any
governmental
function
is
identified
with
the
sovereignty
of
the
state,
and
yet
the
officer
who
is
ordered
by
the
state
to
perform
that
function
can
be
enjoined
under
young.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
isn't
entirely
defeated
if
the
state
has,
as
i
assumed
it
had,
a
right
to
contest
the
title
in
a
forum
of
its
own
choosing,
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
state
is
suffering
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
if
its
officers
lose
this
suit,
the
consequences
of
that
may
very
well
precipitate
the
state
into
having
to
litigate
the
title
itself.
but
what
the
eleventh
amendment
protects
is
not
circumstances
requiring
the
state
as
a
practical
matter
to
litigate,
but
rather,
it
protects
it
from
being
hauled
into
a
particular
forum
to
do
its
litigation,
and
therefore,
if
what
the
state
is
ultimately
suffering
is
in
effect
the
precipitation
of
litigation
in
the
absence
of
which
it
will
suffer
in
some
way.
i
don't
see
that
that
is
the
eleventh
amendment's
concern.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
we
were
to
hold,
in
explaining
a
judgment
here,
that
the
state
would
not
be
estopped
as
a
result
of
this
judgment
against
the
officers
if
it
wishes
later
on
to
litigate
its
title,
then
you
would
have
no
quarrel,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
understand
your
position...
yes.
so
you
say
that
the
respondent
tribe
could
not
bring
a
quiet
title
action
in
state
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
your...
isn't
the
essence
of
your
argument,
i
guess,
and
your
best
answer
to
justice
stevens,
if
i
understood
you
earlier,
that
ex
parte
young
is
concerned
with
a
situation
in
which
the
plaintiff
claims
under
federal
law,
and
the
officers
sued
are
claiming
under
state
law,
and
here
you're
saying
both
parties
are
claiming
under
federal
law,
and
that's
why
young
doesn't
apply.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
if
we
understand
ex
parte
young
simply
to
be
a
means
of
litigating
a
claim
of
federal
right
against
state
officers,
then
it
would
not
in
any
way
be
dispositive
that
the
state
officers
were
themselves
claiming
to
be
operating
consistently
with
federal
law,
or
to
be
claiming
affirmatively
that
they
had
a
federal
right
to
do
what
they
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
mean,
that
would
be
the
end
of
your
argument,
i
take
it,
there,
and
i
guess
my
question
is
going
to
be,
doesn't
every
defendant
in
an
ex
parte
young
case
say,
i
am
operating
consistently
with
federal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
that
the
only
thing
peculiar
about
this
case
is
that
they're
pointing,
in
effect
the
state
officers
here
are
pointing,
or
are
going
to
point
if
they
have
to,
to
a
title
claim
rather
than
to
some
other
basis
in
federal
law
to
say
that
they
are
acting
lawfully
within
the
meaning
of
federal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
which--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
that
goes
to
the
merits.
i'm
just
saying,
what
are
the
issues
that
are
being
litigated,
and
the
issue
that's
being
litigated
is,
on
the
plaintiff's
part,
a
claim
of
federal
right,
on
the
defendant's
part,
a
claim
to
be
acting
consistently
with
federal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
is
true
of
every
ex
parte
young
case
that
is
ever
litigated,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it
protects
a
state...
it
protects
a
state
from
being
hauled
into
a
federal
court
under
certain
circumstances,
and
ex
parte
young
says
you
can
in
those
same
circumstances
sue
the
officer.
ex
parte
young
cases
are
by
nature
based
on
claims
of
federal
right
and
defenses
based
on
claims
of
consistency
with
federal
law.
that's
what
you've
got
here,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
givens...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
please.
i
wondered
if...
i'm
slightly...
i'd
appreciate
some
clarification
on
this
question
of
title
versus
what's
going
on
here.
my
understanding
of
it
was
that
really
this
is
a
suit
which
someone
who
was
not
steeped
in
eleventh
amendment
law
would
say
was
a
suit
for
title.
i
don't
know
what
the
state
can
do,
if
you
win,
with
this
submerged
land.
i
don't
know
what
laws
it
could
enforce.
it
sounds
like
you're
getting
the
property.
the
only
reason
i
suppose
that
title
came
in
is,
in
a
case
called
tindal
the
court
held
that
a
suit
just
like
this
one
wasn't
really
against
the
state,
though
it
is,
but
nonetheless
we
give
the
state
an
escape
hatch,
that
because
of
the
last
paragraph
the
state
won't
be
bound
as
to
title,
thus
they
get
an
extra
chance
to
come
back
and
fight
it
if
they
want.
is
that
understanding
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
givens,
may
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question
from
justice
ginsburg?
i'm
not
sure
that
this
should
be
dispositive
of
anything
in
the
case,
but
as
i
recall
your
answer,
it
was...
in
questioning
whether
this
case
fit
within
the
ex
parte
young
framework.
you
said
that
in
fact
what
the
state
officers
were
claiming
here,
were
claiming
rights
to
regulate
in
the
enforcement
of
state
law.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
merely
a
matter
of
two
contesting
titles,
there
was
state
law
which
had
been
enacted
to
determine
just
how
the
state
would
regulate,
and
what
it
would
do,
and
that
therefore
the
contest
here
was
really
a
contest
between
a
claim
of
superior
title
on
the
one
hand
and
a
claim
to
enforce
particular
state
laws
which
ultimately
implied
a
contrary
claim
of
title,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
we
in
a
position
to
assess
that
answer,
because
i
thought
the
very
answer
that
you
gave
to
justice
kennedy
earlier
was
that
there
are
no
specific
detailed
claims
against
state
officers
at
this
point,
that's
just
not
the
state
of
the
pleadings,
and
you
said,
well,
we
ought
to
go
back
and
amend.
so,
are
we
really
in
a
position
to
accept
your
answer
that
what
is
being
contested
here
are
particular
acts
of
regulation
by
particular
state
officers
enforcing
particular
state
laws?
is
that
really
before
us?
