don't
say
it's
correct
if
you
don't
really
agree
with
it,
because
you're
the
expert
in
this
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes...
i
mean,
no,
no,
if
you
do
agree,
fine.
i'm
happy
that
that
is
correct,
if
it
is,
but
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
follow
through
the
intricacies.
i
got
your
argument
before
that
you
thought
in
reality
ex
parte
young
is
simply
a
way
of
permitting
in
certain
cases
the
assertion
of
the
federal
interest
in
states
obeying
federal
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
think
that
you
can't
distinguish
real
property
cases
where
the
federal
law
gives
the
property
to
jones,
or
smith,
or
the
indian
tribe
from
cases
involving
mental
hospitals,
schools,
churches,
whatever.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
then
we
run
into
this
doctrine,
and
you
think
tindal
is
strongly
in
support
of
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
we
have,
is
it
fair
to
characterize...
we
have
a
fiction
on
a
fiction.
there's
the
fiction
of
ex
parte
young,
because
it's
simply
a
fictional
way
of
allowing
the
assertion
of
federal
supremacy
in
an
important
number
of
cases.
and
then
we
have
the
fiction
that
that
wasn't
really
a
property
state
title,
which
it
is,
and
now
we
get
a
new
fiction
which
allows
the
state
to
come
back
and
really
sue
for
title,
even
though
you
win
this
case.
you
win
the
case,
the
state
isn't
barred
from
bringing
its
title
suit,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
the
answer
on
that
point,
on
that
very
point
in
tindal?
i
thought
they
got
that
from
the
last
paragraph
of
tindal,
so
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
the
court...
this
court
seemed
to
divide
all
the
aspects
of
title...
i
mean,
with
the
fiction
of
the
title
itself,
and
says
the
state
gets
another
chance
to
litigate
it.
