chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-1474,
idaho
v.
coeur
d'alene
tribe
of
idaho.
mr.
strong.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
state
sends
another
crop
of
officers
who
haven't
been
named
in
this
particular
action,
are
they
bound
by
the
previous
decree
against
the
original
state
officers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
an
action
pending
now
which
the
united
states
has
brought?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish
the
old
case
of
tindal
v.
wesley?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
from
the
tribe's
point
of
view,
i
suppose
if
they
have
good
title
and
the
state
occupies
their
land,
they
would
be
able
to
treat
it
as
some
form
of
inverse
eminent
domain,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
givens,
you
raise
two
questions
in
your
petition,
and
you
have
had
no
opportunity
yet
to
get
to
the
second
one.
i
hope
you'll
take
some
time,
if
my
colleagues
allow
you
to
get
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
strong.
mr.
givens,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
when
the
indian
tribe
is
the
plaintiff?
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
aren't
the
court...
what
is
it,
the
circuit
court,
the
superior
court,
the
district
court--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
district
court
is
a
court
of
general
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
it's
not
confined
to
certain
types
of
cases.
you
can
bring
any
case
you
want,
can't
you,
if...
unless
there's
an
amount
in
controversy
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
an
indian
tribe
couldn't
go
into
the
district
court
of
ada
county
or
something
like
that
and
sue
someone
who
is
trespassing
on
tribal
property,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tindal
tends
to
negate
your
statement
that
you
distinguish
sharply
between
state
officer
suits
and
federal
officer
suits.
didn't
they
say
there
that
a
question
whether
a
particular
suit
is
won
against
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
must
depend
on
the
same
principles
that
determine
whether
a
particular
suit
is
won
against
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
right.
what
good
does
it
do
you,
then,
to
win
this
case
if
the
state
isn't
bound?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
really...
you...
the
benefit
you
get
is,
you
get
the
same
result
as
if
you
acquire
the
title.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
they
weren't
talking
about
the
equal
footing
doctrine
then,
were
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
midwest
oil
was
certainly
distinguished
in
the
steel
seizure
case,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
sure
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
could
have
the
reservation
here
by
executive
proclamation
and
simply
not
get
the
submerged
land
rights.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
further
would
you
do...
i
mean,
if,
in
fact,
a
presidential
proclamation
without
the
authority
of
congress
cannot
cut
off
a
state's
rights
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
there's
nothing
that
a
trial
is
going
to
prove
about
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
at
least
that
would
decide
this...
if
we
were
to
hold
that,
that
would
decide
this
aspect
of
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
won't
detain
you.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
strong,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
strong.
the
case
is
submitted.
