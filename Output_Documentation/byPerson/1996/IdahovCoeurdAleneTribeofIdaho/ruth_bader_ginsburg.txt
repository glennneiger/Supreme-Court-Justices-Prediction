mr.
strong,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
this
case
is
about
where
the
suit
will
be,
and
idaho
has
a
state
court
remedy,
a
state
court
where
this
disputed
question
can
be
tried
out.
is
that,
the
existence
of
that
remedy,
essential
to
your
position?
let's
suppose
idaho
did
not
choose
to
consent
to
be
sued
on
this
matter
at
all,
would
your
position
be
any
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
that
idaho
has
chosen
to
give
the
tribe
a
remedy
in
idaho's
own
courts,
but
doesn't
have
to,
so
we
would
be
left
with
the
anomaly,
if
idaho
hadn't
consented
to
be
sued
in
its
own
courts,
of
a
dispute
over
title
determined
by
federal
law,
right,
because
both
sides
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--staking
their
claim
on
federal
law,
and
no
federal
court
could
hear
it,
and
a
state
court
has
chosen
not
to
hear
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
up
to
the
united
states
to
pursue
that
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
just
tell
us
briefly
what
the
reasoning
of
that
is,
that
quiet
title
actions
don't
impact
the
sovereignty
of
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
the
in
rem
personification
notion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
case
that's
odd,
because
we're
only
talking
about
federal
law
on
both
sides.
the
usual
justification
for
young
is
that
you
have
to
vindicate
the
superior
federal
law
as
against
the
inferior
state
law,
but
here
both
sides
are
advancing
federal
law
as
the
basis
for
their
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
givens,
isn't
it
more
than
similar?
isn't...
aren't
you
saying
in
effect
you
get...
the
result
of
your
lawsuit,
if
it
were
allowed
to
go
forward,
would
be,
you'd
have
title
as
against
all
the
world
except
the
state
of
ohio...
idaho?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you
would
have
to
establish
your
title,
although
one
party,
idaho,
wouldn't
be
bound
by
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
both...
i
think
we
can
agree
that
they
both
can't
own
the
same
land.
it
either
belongs
to
one
or
the
other,
and
my
question
to
you
is,
isn't
the
thrust
of
your
lawsuit,
we
own
it?
there's
one
party
left
out
there
who
can
contest
that
but
no
one
else
in
the
world.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
idaho
could
have
no
complaint,
could
they,
except
for
a
defense
on
the
merits,
if
the
united
states
in
its
suit
had
chosen
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
the
tribe
for
this
entire...
for
all
the
land
that
the
tribe
is
now
claiming,
rather
than
just
a
part
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there's
nothing
to
indicate
why
the
united
states...
in
this
record
why
the
united
states
sued
for
less
than
what
the
tribe
is
claiming
in
this--
