mr.
raymond
c.
givens
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court:
the
state
is
really
asking
for...
its
state
officers
are
asking
for
a
new
submerged
land
exception
to
pretty...
very
well-developed
areas
of
the
law.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
the
short
answer
is
no,
there
are
no
supplemental
pleadings,
your
honor,
and
that's
part
of
the
difficulty
of
the
whole
case.
we're
at...
this
case
stems
from
the
most
preliminary
procedures.
the
tribe
filed
its
complaint...
it
is
a
generalized
complaint.
it
does
specify
certain
statutes
that
they
are...
the
state
officers
are
operating
under.
the
governor
is
holding
a
statutorily...
state
statutorily
created
water
right.
the
members
of
the
land
board
that
was...
are
enforcing
a
state
statute
that
gives
encroachment
permits.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
in...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
at--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--our
response
to
the
petition
for
cert,
page--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--page
12.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
asking
that
the
water
right
of
67...
4304
be
declared
invalid,
and
the
rest
of
them,
your
honor,
are
really
in
more
of
a
general
way.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
it
should
be...
it
needs
to
be
amended,
your
honor,
for...
obviously
for
that
reason.
if
the
state
felt
that
there
was...
they
didn't
understand
what
we
were
suing
about.
of
course,
there's
the
rule
for
asking
for
more
specific
statement.
the
other
reason
the
complaint
needs
to
be
amended
is
that
when
the
complaint
was
filed
we
felt
we
had
a
theory
because
of
the
way
idaho
defined
its
sovereignty
as
to
not
include
quiet
title
actions
that
we
could
sue
the
state
for
quiet
title.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
yes.
there
are
two
idaho
supreme
court
cases
that
say
that
quiet
title
actions
do
not
impact
the
sovereignty
of
the
state,
and
we
felt
because
of
that
the
eleventh
amendment
was
not
applicable.
the
ninth
circuit
felt
otherwise.
we
asked
this
court
to
review
that.
it
chose
not
to,
so
it's
not
part
of
the
case,
so
to
get
that
out
of
the
case
we're
going
to
have
to
amend
on
remand,
and
very
well
the
complaint
should
be
more
specific.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
the
cases
are
roddy
and
the
lyons
cases,
and
the...
the
thinking
of
the
idaho
court
was
simply
that
quiet
title
actions
were
actions
against
the
land,
not
against
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
they
didn't
use
those
exact
words,
but
that
basic
concept,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
maybe
i
didn't
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
the
idaho
court
was...
in
the
roddy
and
lyons
cases
were
presented
with
a...
claims
against
the
state
to
quiet
title,
and
they
chose
not
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
judicially,
which
is
what
most
states
have
done.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
very
serious
question
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
of
course,
there's
the
initial
question
of
no
state
court
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe,
personal
jurisdiction,
but
there
is
also
a
very
serious
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question.
from
the
outset
of
the
indian
law
jurisprudence
in
this
country,
the
courts
have
held
that,
generally,
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
indian
lands--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--well...
i'm
not
talking
about
personal
jurisdiction,
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
district--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--yes.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
well,
i
guess
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
litigants
cannot
create
subject
matter
jurisdiction
upon
a
court
that
it
doesn't
otherwise
have,
and
the
only
congressional
act
that...
or
the
primary
congressional
act
that
conveyed
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
state
courts
to
adjudicate
indian
interests
was
public
law
280,
of
course,
and
in
that...
in
public
law
280,
as
is
discussed
in
bryan/itasca
county,
it's
very
clear
that
the
statute...
congress
specifically
said
that
state
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
property
determinations
in
indian
country
against
tribes.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
i
guess
it
would
be...
the
short
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
there
is
a
serious
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
would
be
like
someone
in
maryland
going
into
a
virginia
court
and
suing
to
quiet
title
against
someone
in
virginia
for
property
in
maryland.
the
tribe's
basis
of
the
whole
lawsuit
in
this
case
is,
of
course,
the
tribe's
title
to
the
lake.
it
is
not...
the
tribe
is
not
trying
to
take
anything
away
from
the
state.
the
tribe
has
always
owned
that
lake,
in
the
tribe's
position,
and
all
that
the
tribe
is
asking
for
is
to
have
a
federal
court
hold
that
the
state
officers
who
are
regulating
on
that
lake
are...
should
not
be
doing
that.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
for...
yes,
your
honor,
for
a
portion
of
the
lake.
lake
coeur
d'alene
is
a
long,
skinny
lake,
and
the
united
states
has
brought
suit
for
a
portion
of
the
southern
part
of
the
lake.
the
tribes
suit
is
for
the
entire
lake,
so
part
of
it
is
covered
by
the
u.s.'s
suit,
part
of
it
is
not.
the
tribe
has
been
granted
intervention
status
in
that
case,
and
we
tried
to
expand
it
to
the
whole
suit
and
the
district
court
i
think
quite
properly
limited
it
to
the
parameters
of
the
united
states'
complaint.
as
to
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
generally,
if
i
could
get
to
that,
the
thrust
of
the
state's
argument,
state
officer's
argument,
as
we
understand
them,
is
that
there
is
another
remedy,
just
as
we've
been
speaking
of,
this
state
court
remedy,
and
the
tribe
could
go
there
like
any
other
citizen
could
go
to
state
court.
well,
there
may
be
problems
with
it
we
just
discussed,
but
the
state
officers
merge
federal
officer
suits
and
state
officer
suits
and
pick
and
choose
bits
and
pieces
of
cases
back
and
forth,
when
in
reality
when
they're
looked
at
carefully
they
really
come
from
protecting
different
interests
in
the
eleventh
amendment
or
in
a
sovereign
immunity
context.
the
federal
officer
suits
are
designed
to
provide
a
remedy
primarily
in
the
takings
area,
and
as
congress
has
provided
those
remedies,
be
it
the
quiet
title
act
or
some
other
remedy,
then
there
is
not
the
constitutional
problem
in
federal
officer
suits.
in
the
state
officer
suits,
the
problem
has
primarily
been
the
supremacy
of
federal
law.
there
have
been
a
few
state
officer
suits
where
the
federal
law
problem
has
been
lack
of
a
remedy,
but
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
the
state
officers'
position
finds
no
support
in
the
cases
that
actually
provided
the
foundation
for
ex
parte
young,
the
tindal,
particularly
tindal.
there's...
it
is...
unless
there
is
a
distinction
made
because
this
is
submerged
land
as
opposed
to
any
other
kind
of
land.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
the
federal...
violation
of
federal
law,
the
supremacy
interest
that
was
being
protected
in
tindal
in
that
case
was
a
taking
interest.
the...
just
as
it
was
in
lee.
there
wasn't...
hadn't
been
provided
a
remedy,
so
to
that
context
the
two
concepts
merged.
in
this
case
the
federal
interest
that
is
being
protected
is
the
constitutional
primacy
of
federal
regulation,
federal
control
of
indian
reservations.
the
statutes
which
implemented
various
aspects
of
the
creation
of
the
coeur
d'alene
reservation
is
the
executive
order
and
the
common
law
theory
of
aboriginal
title
of
the
tribes,
so
there...
i
mean,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
one
of
those
situations,
i
think,
where
you
can
say
yes,
this
is
like
that,
but
really,
when
you
look
at
it
underneath,
tindal,
just
like
all
of
the
other
state
officer
suits,
are
protecting
the
supremacy
of
federal
law.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
your
honor,
there's
no
question
but
what
the
state
officers
thrust
that
forward
as
their
argument,
but
i
think
the
more
appropriate
way
to
analyze
the
issue
here
is
that
the
tribe
claims
ownership
based
on
federal
law,
and
as
a
result
of
that
claimed
ownership,
is
asking
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
state
officers
from
their
regulation
of
the
tribe's
lake
under
state
law.
now,
then
the
state
officers
come
back
on
the
other
hand
and
say
well,
no,
we
have
a
claim
under
federal
law
why
our
officers
are
doing
the
right
thing,
and
it...
it's
just
as
justice
souter
was
describing
in
his
question.
it's
exactly
the
same
sort
of
situation,
really,
that
you
always
have
in
any
ex
parte
young
situation
where
the
state
officers
are
saying
we
are
acting
appropriately
under
federal
law,
whether
it
be
this
particular
one
or
some
other
federal
law
that
justifies
our
action.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
well,
your
honor,
that's
what
we
did,
and
the...
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
could
not
do,
because
that
would
be
an
adjudication
against
the
state.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
officers
themselves,
those
are
the
only
defendants
that
we're
left
with.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
that
is
correct.
that
is
the--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--well,
it's...
i
guess
it's
like--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--the
issue
of
title
will
be
an
issue,
just
as--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--that
is
exactly
the
question
that
this
court
addressed
in
lee,
it
is
exactly
the
question
this
court
addressed
in
tindal,
and
in
both
instances
they
said
no,
we
can
separate
the
determination
of
title
from
the,
in
those
cases
trespass,
in
this
case
regulation
by
the
state
officers.
the
litigation
against
the
state
officers
does
not
preclude
the
state
from
later
litigating
title,
and--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--the
officers...
it
is
never
within
the
officer's
ability
as
a
state
officer
to
violate
the
federal
constitution,
and
these...
part
of
which
is
the
supremacy
clause,
and
that
is
where
the
state
officer
and
federal
officer
cases
depart,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
is
why
it
is
so
important
to
keep
clearly
in
mind
which
interest
is
really
being
protected.
in
the
state
officer
cases
the
constitutional
interest
that
is
at
issue
is
the
supremacy
of
federal
law,
it
is
not
the...
whether
or
not
the
state
officer
is
acting
within
or
without
his
authority.
that
state
officer
can
be
acting
within
his
authority
under
state
law
and
still
be
acting
in
violation
of
federal
law
unconstitutionally,
and
the
thrust
of
all
of
ex
parte
young
jurisprudence
is
that
this...
the
federal
court
still
should
appropriately
provide
a
remedy
not
necessarily
to
test
whether
or
not
the
officer
is
acting
properly
or
improperly,
but
to
uphold
the
supremacy
of
federal
law.
that
is
the
underlying
thrust
of
all
the
state
officer
cases.
so
to
the
extent
that
the...
this
is...
this
factual
situation
is
a
little
bit
different
than
larson,
it
is...
the
result
should
be
different
in
larson,
it
is
because
it
rests
on
different
underpinnings.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
i
think
that
would
be
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--oh,
maybe
i
misunderstood
exactly
what
you
said,
then.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they're
both
based
on
the
supremacy
of
federal
law.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
it
is
to
the
extent,
your
honor
that
tindal
said
clearly
that
you...
the
federal
court
can
enjoin
a
state
officer
who
is
holding
property
unconstitutionally
without
adjudicating
the
title
to
that
property.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
the
state
officers
can
no
longer
regulate
the
tribe's
lake.
the--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--there
are
very...
there
are
similarities,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
and
the--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--the...
after--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--the...
in
determining
this
suit,
the
court
would
adjudicate
the
tribe's
ownership.
it
would
not
have
to
adjudicate
the
state's
ownership.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
that's
right,
and
as
with
any...
anyone
who
files
any
quiet
title
action,
if
you
don't
sue
jones
and
jones
has
a
claim
to
it,
you
may
get
your
quiet...
your
title
quieted
to
everybody
except
jones.
jones
can
still
come
in
and
make
a
claim
for
it.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
the...
you
may
be
correct,
your
honor.
it
puts
a
litigant,
of
course,
in
a
difficult
position.
you
plead
a
complaint
with
several
different
counts
and
theories,
and
the
appellate
court
says,
well,
you
lose
on
some
of
those,
and
there
are
some
that's
left,
and
instead
of
having
the
opportunity
then
to
amend
as
you
would
on
remand
normally,
all
of
a
sudden
you're
up
here
on
the
remainder.
the
preliminary
nature
of
this
case
makes
it
very
difficult
to
deal
with
this...
not
only
this
issue,
but
also
the
property
clause
issue,
and
if
i
could
just
address
that
for
just
a
moment,
the
tension
in
the
property
clause
that
the
state
officers
raise
is
really
between
the
executive
and
the
congress.
and,
again,
the
state
officers
are
asking
for
a
unique
exception
to
some
very
well
settled
law
in
this
regard.
thirty
years
ago
in
arizona,
california,
this
court
said
that
there
was
no
difference
between
reservations,
indian
reservations
created
by
executive
order
and
those
created
by
treaty
as
to
either
land
or
water.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
they
were
not.
they
were
talking
water
rights,
your
honor.
the...
80
years
ago--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--the...
well,
the
creation
of
the
reservation
can
or
cannot
convey
land,
and
there
was
little
analysis
in
that
case,
there's
no
question
about
that,
but
it
did
cite
to
midwest
oil,
which
was
decided
80
years
ago
when
this
court
held
that
the
congressional
acquiescence
could...
or
by
congressional.
acquiescence
executive
orders
creating
reservations,
those
reservations
would
be
valid.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
it...
acquiescence
is
not
a--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--favored
doctrine.
however,
coeur
d'alene
was
cited
as
one
of
the
99
indian
reservations
in
midwest
oil.
one
hundred
and
twenty-five
years
ago
in
holden
this
court
said
that
if
there's
an
executive
order
and
then
later
congressional
acts
that
recognize
that,
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
have
four
of
them
that
were
listed
in
the
brief,
all
pre-statehood,
that
specifically
recognize
the
coeur
d'alene
reservation,
specifically
recognized
the...
what
the
executive
had
done.
and
probably
most
on
point,
in
1888
congress
asked
the
executive,
does
this
reservation
include
some
of
this
navigable
waters,
and
should
we
send...
appoint
a
negotiating
team
to
go
out
and
negotiate
for
the
cession
of
some
of
that?
the
executive
branch
said
yes,
it
does,
and
if
you
do,
you
should
pay
them
for
it.
they
then
acted
affirmatively
upon
that
and
appointed
a
negotiating
team,
so
there
is
that
later
congressional
recognition.
finally,
as--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--that's
entirely
possible,
your
honor,
and
the
difficulty
with
even
arguing
this
issue
at
this
point
is,
it
is
at
such
