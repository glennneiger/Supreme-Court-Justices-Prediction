despite
the
federal
quiet
title
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
does
not
limit,
in
your
view,
the
tribe
from
filing
a
quiet
title
action
in
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state
of
idaho
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
for
such
a
suit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
authority
from
this
court
do
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
adjudication
of
the
state's
sovereign
title
question
in
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
pretty
strange
doctrine,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
if
the
state
claims
sovereign
title
and
the
quiet
title
action
deprives
the
state
of
it,
how
can
it
be
said
it
doesn't
affect
the
state
in
its
sovereign
capacity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
see
how
the
state
could
take
the
position
that
a
quiet
title
action
asserting
that
the
state
lacks
title
to
lands
that
the
state
claims
in
its
sovereign
capacity,
how
can
it
be
said
that
doesn't
affect
the
state
sovereign
interests?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
do
agree
in
any
event
that
a
quiet
title
action
could
be
brought
by
the
tribe
in
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact,
there
is
another
suit
pending
right
now
that
would
determine
the
issue
of
title?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
givens,
could
you...
could
the
tribes
sue
in
federal
court
just
to
determine
title
to
this
property,
or
do
you
concede
that
that
is
not...
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
bar
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
accept
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
and
you
are
not
here
arguing
that
the
tribe
could
bring
a
direct
suit
in
federal
court
to
determine
title.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
are
the
attributes
of
title
ownership?
they
are
the
right
to
possess
and
control
and
regulate
the
property,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
won't
that
have
to
be
determined
basically
by
deciding
who
has
the
title?
i
mean,
how
would
you
ever
be
able
to
determine
that
the
tribe
has
the
right
to
possess,
regulate,
and
exclusively
do
so
without
determining
that
the
tribe
had
title
and
that's
the
basis
for
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
being
the
case,
i
don't
see
why
the
eleventh
amendment
shouldn't
be
a
bar
here,
because
you
are
in
essence
asking
the
court
to
do
what
you've
conceded
the
court
can't
do.
i
just
don't
see
why
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
kick
in
here.
