now--
--of
course,
it
works
the
other
way
around.
if
you...
if
you
prevail
on
the
merits
with
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
the
president
had
no
authority
to
convey
away
the
lands,
i
take
it
you
would
have
the
benefit
of
that
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
idaho...
suppose
the
suit
were
to
go
forward
and
idaho
would
prevail
in
this
suit,
or
the
officers
would
prevail
in
this
suit,
and
it
were
held
that
the
land
had
not
been
conveyed
to
the
tribes,
that
would
work
to
your
benefit,
i
take
it.
you
could--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
the
complaint
is
rather
sketchy
as
to
what
these
officers
are
supposed
to
be
doing.
it
names
the
governor
and
the
commissioner
of
lands,
i
believe,
and
the
secretary
of
state.
does
it
set
forth
with
any
specificity,
or
do
other
pleadings,
supplemental
pleadings
set
forth
with
any
specificity
exactly
what
these
officers
are
doing
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
ownership
that
you
allege?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
set
forth
in
the
complaint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
see
that.
it's
in
your
response
at
page--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--three.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
page...
it
begins
at
page
3--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
then
that's
at
page
12.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
brings
us--
--yes,
but
that
simply
sets
forth
the
extent
of
the
declaration
that
you
choose.
it
doesn't
say
that
any
particular
officer
is
enforcing
this
in
any
particular
respect.
it
just
seems
to
me
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
this
is
a
very
sketchy
pleading.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
different...
creating
a
reservation
is
much
different
than
conveying
land.
