paul

yes,
but
if
they're...
if
the
tribe
is
right
on
the
merits,
aren't
they
then
violating
some
federal
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
sort
of
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
they're
wrong
on
the
merits,
an
issue
we
don't
reach
until
we
decide
the
threshold
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
correct...
i
know
you
say
here
there
is
both
a
federal
action
pending
where
the
united
states
is
suing,
and
there's
a
state
forum
available,
but
if
neither
of
those
things
were
true,
we
had
a
different
case,
you
would
still
say
that
there
was
no
remedy
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
federal
question
could
never
be
resolved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
with
the
exception
created
by
ex
parte
young.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
unlawful
in
the
sense
that
they
violated
a
supreme
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
didn't
know
in
ex
parte
young
until
after
the
case
was
tried
whether
there
was
a
violation,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
a
rebuttable
presumption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
also
a
presumption
in
the
ex
parte
young
area
that
state
action
is
generally
considered
lawful
and
constitutional?
you
always
start
with
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
whenever
you
challenge
state
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
don't
understand
why
the
presumption
in
the
montana
case
is
any
different
from
the
general
presumption
that
state
action
conforms
with
the
constitution.
that's
where
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
argument.
