he
could
walk
in
and
seize
the
land,
i
presume,
send
in
the
state
national
guard
and
wait
for
somebody
to
sue
to
get
it
off
the
land.
couldn't
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
theory
is
that
that
doesn't
run
against
the
state,
it
just
runs
against
the
state
officers.
you've
got
to
get
some
other
state
officer,
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
think
it
always
operates
in
such
a
way
that
in
fact
the
state
is
not
bound?
i
mean,
i
always
thought
ex
parte
young
was
just
a
great
fiction,
that
in
fact
99
percent
of
the
time
you
can
say
the
suit
is
only
against
the
officers,
but
as
a
fact...
as
a
practical
matter
the
state
is,
you
know,
is
precluded.
you
don't
think
that's
the
way
it
works
normally?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
land
and
treasury,
land
and
treasury
we
won't
apply
ex
parte
young?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
even
if
that
remedy
did
not
exist,
as
well
as
the
remedy
of
suit
in
state
court,
which
you
say
also
exists,
it
still
would
not
be
a
unique
situation.
presumably...
namely
that
the
situation
of
the
tribe
not
being
able
to
get
relief
would
presumably
not
be
unique,
or
relief
in
federal
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
that's
presumably
the
situation
with
respect
to
all
claims
to
money
from
the
state
treasury.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
include
what,
quiet
title
actions?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
givens,
larson
is
more
recent
than
those,
and
i
thought
it
was
made
pretty
clear
in
larson,
which
was
against
the
federal
government,
of
course,
that
you
can't
proceed
unless
either
the
officers
are
acting
beyond
their
authority
ultra
vires,
or
their
action
is
unconstitutional.
now,
that
was
a
federal
case
against
the
united
states,
but
i
thought
that
we
made
clear,
or
at
least
the
various
opinions
made
clear
in
treasure
salvors
that
we
would
apply
larson
in
the
state
context
as
well.
now,
would
you
meet
the
requirements
of
larson?
