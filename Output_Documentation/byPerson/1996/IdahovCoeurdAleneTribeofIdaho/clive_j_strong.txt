mr.
clive
j.
strong
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
states
are
part
of
the
union,
they
nonetheless
retain
certain
attributes
of
sovereignty.
two
of
those
retained
attributes
of
sovereignty,
the
states
sovereign
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment
and
a
state's
entitlement
to
lands
beneath
the
beds
and
banks
of
navigable
waters
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
state
of
idaho
has
been
in
possession
of
the
beds
and
banks
of
the
navigable
waters
of
lake
coeur
d'alene
since
statehood.
pursuant
to
that
possession,
the
state,
pursuant
to
its
duty,
has
regulated
those
lands
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
as
a
whole.
this
action
now
by
the
tribe
seeks
to
divest
the
state
of
that
possession
and
instead
reside
it
with
the
tribe.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
this
action
by
the
tribes
with
respect
to
quiet
title
claims
was
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
nonetheless,
the
court
proceeded
to
allow
the
suit
with
respect
to
the
state
officers
to
proceed
under
the
rationale
of
ex
parte
young.
under
the
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
sought
by
the
tribe,
the
tribe
would
be
awarded
quiet
title
and
exclusive
possession
of
these
lands.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
by
the
very
nature
of
these
properties,
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
title
from
the
possession
of
the
property.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
the
very
nature
of
this
lands
is
what
brings
the
difficult
interplay
with
ex
parte
young.
under
the
officer's
suit
rationale
it
is
assumed
that
the
state
simply
could
bring
another
action
to
clear
its
title
to
these
lands,
but
if
the
tribe
were
awarded
possession
of
these
lands,
under
section
28
2409a,
the
federal
quiet
title
act
specifically
precludes
an
action
by
the
state
against
the
united
states
government
for
possessions
of
lands
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
likewise,
tribal
sovereign
immunity
would
preclude
the
state
from
bringing
an
action
against
the
tribal...
against
the--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--the
quiet
title
act
would
because
of
the
language
in
the
act
that
precludes
an
action
by
a
state
against
the
united
states
for
lands
that
are
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
the
act...
the
argument
would
be
made--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
that
would
be
the
only
way
the
state
could
perfect
its
title
in
this
case.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
the
state
would
be
bound
to
abide
by
lawful
orders
of
this
court.
the
state
officers
are
the
ones
that
are
being
enjoined
from
possession
of
these
lands--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--but
the
state
cannot
act
but
through
its
officers.
if
the
officers
are
enjoined
from
proceeding,
there
is
no
way
that
the
state
can
go
forward.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
the
successors
in
office
are
the
ones
that
would
be
bound
by
this
particular
order,
but
certainly
they
would
suspect
the
tribe
would
immediately
sue
the
state
to
enjoin
those
people
from
taking
possession
of
the
lands.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
work
to
our
benefit.
the
nature
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
or
the
ex
parte
young
is
a
narrow
exception
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
as
an
exception
to
the
eleventh
amendment,
it
must
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
accommodates
the
substantial
sovereign
interest
at
stake
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
as
this
court
has
stated
in
the
past--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--you're
correct,
your
honor,
it
is
a
fiction,
and
the
fiction
is
that
the
suit
can
go
forward
because
it
doesn't
unnecessarily
interfere
with
the
state's
actions,
but
in
this
instance,
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
title
of
these
lands,
it
interferes
with
the
state
action.
the
lands
that
we're
talking
about
here
are
lands
that
came
to
the
state
through
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
the
lands
that
are
specifically
identified
with
sovereignty,
as
this
court
stated
in
oregon
v.
corvallis
sand
&
gravel,
that
when
you're
dealing
with
submerged
lands
you're
not
dealing
with
the
issue
of
substantive
property
law,
but
rather
with
the
constitutional
sovereignty
of
the
states.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
i'm
saying
in
this
context,
sovereign
lands
is
the
same
as
the
treasury.
you
should
not
allow
an
action
to
proceed
against
lands
that
the
state
receives
as
an
incident
of
sovereignty,
that
incidence
of
sovereignty,
because
of
the
very
nature
of
these
lands,
they're
held
open
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
as
a
whole,
the
state
receives
lands
under
an
equal
footing
doctrine,
is
required
to
manage
those
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
for
commerce,
navigation,
and
other
purposes.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
these
lands
are
identified
directly
with
sovereignty
of
the
state.
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
past--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
if
the
officers
are
enjoined
in
this
action,
however,
the
nature
and
title...
the
title
isn't
in
the
actual
ownership
of
the
property,
but
it's
the
regulation
of
that
property
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
as
a
whole.
if
the
officers
are
enjoined
in
the
ability
to
manage
and
regulate
these
lands
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole,
then
the
very
sovereign
nature
of
that
title
is
entirely
defeated.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
if
the
state
officers
are
enjoined
from
the
regulation
of
these
lands,
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
the
state
does
not
have
a
remedy.
the
state
couldn't
simply
go
out
and
commence
another
action.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor,
because
this
court
cannot
grant
the
relief
the
state
would
need
to
bring
the
action
because
of
the
federal
quiet
title
act,
and
assuming
that
the
tribe
was
successful
in
obtaining
possession,
the
argument
would
be
made
that
our
action
against
the
united
states,
the
actual
trustee
of
these
lands,
would
be
precluded
because
those
lands
were
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
state.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor.
in
fact
the
state's
position
has
been
that
that
is
one
of
the
alternative
remedies
available
to
the--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--well,
the
federal
quiet
title
act
limits
the
state.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no.
the
federal
quiet
title
act
would
have
no
limitation
on
the
tribe.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that...
our
courts
would
be
available
to
the
tribe
to
fully
pursue
in
the
entirety
the
relief
that
they
are
seeking
in
this
action.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
we
look
to
treasure
salvors.
in
treasure
salvors
the...
although
there
was
a
split
plurality
opinion,
all
four
justices
on
each
side
of
that
plurality
ultimately
held
that
you
cannot
adjudicate
a
state's
title
in
the
context
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
would
be
precluded.
you
have
to
somehow
be
able
to
segregate
the
possession
of
the
property
under
treasure
salvors
from
the
title
to
the
property
in
order
to
move
forward.
the
point
that
we're
making
here
is,
is
that
under
the
presumption
in
montana,
which
is
a
strong
presumption
of
state
ownership,
that
the
only
way
you
can
determine
that
the...
the
court
can
determine
that
the
tribe
is
entitled
to
possession
of
these
lands
is
to
first
determine
that
the
presumption
of
state
ownership
has
been
overcome,
and
that
the
united
states
abandoned
its
traditional
policy
in
favor
of
holding
these
lands
in
trust.
rather
than
the
issue
of
taking
tribal
property,
this
case
really
presents
an
issue
of
whether
the
united
states
took
the
state's
sovereign
title
and
instead
bestowed
it
upon
the
tribe.
that
is
the
very
nature
of
this
case,
and
because
it
involves
the
state's
title
is
why
it
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor,
our
position
would
be
no
different.
the
eleventh
amendment
precludes
an
action
against
the
state,
directly
against
the
state,
and
since
this
is
a
determination
of
the
state's
title,
it
would
be
precluded
by
the
eleventh
amendment
regardless
of
the
unavailability
of
the
forum.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
that's
correct.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor,
there
is
another
remedy
that's
available
to
the
tribe
which
also
takes
us
outside
the
context
of
ex
parte
young.
a
tribe
is
a
dependent
sovereign
nation,
is...
cannot
hold
legal
title
to
these
trust
lands.
legal
title
is
held
by
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
tribe,
so
the
tribe
has
a
remedy
here
that's
not
traditionally
available
in
an
ex
parte
young--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
that
is
correct,
but
the
tribe
can
petition
the
united
states
to
bring
an
action
on
its
behalf,
and
if
the
united
states
fails
to
take
such
action,
and
the
tribe
believes
that
it
should
be
taking
further
action
with
respect
to
this
property,
it
has
a
remedy
against
the
united
states
to
bring
an
action,
breach
of
trust
action
against
the
united
states
to
force
it
to
either
litigate
the
title,
or
compensate
it.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
an
action
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
idaho,
and
that
action
is
properly
brought
under
texas
v....
united
states
v.
texas.
the
state
has
no
objection
to
an
action
by
the
trustee
of
these
lands
as
against
the
state
of
idaho.
the
law
is
very
clear
on
that
matter.
that
action
seeks
to
quiet
title
to
the
southern
third
of
lake
coeur
d'alene.
it
again
verifies
the
fact
that
there
is
a
remedy
available
to
the
tribe,
and
that
is
to
petition
the
united
states
to
bring
an
action
on
its
behalf.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
would
not
be--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
very
nature
of
the
eleventh
amendment
creates
this
tension
where
there
may
not
be
an
available
remedy,
and
the
idea
of
ex
parte
young
was
to
address
that
situation,
but
as
i've
demonstrated
both
through
the
action
by
the
tribe
in
state
court,
or
by
the
action
of
the
united
states,
the
rationale
for
ex
parte
young
is
not
applicable
in
the
context--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--tindal
v.
wesley
has
been
limited
by
the
larson
case,
and
in
that...
what
it
basically
says
is
that
there
has
to
be
either
an
action
by
the
officer
acting
ultra
vires,
larson
does,
or
alternatively
that
there
has
to
be
some
violation
of
federal
law.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
suit
that
the
state
officers
were
acting
any...
outside
of
their
authority.
in
fact,
the
state
officers
are
doing
exactly
what
was
expected
of
them
under
the
presumption
of
federal
ownership,
that
is,
regulating
these
lands
on
behalf
of
the
public
as
a
whole.
as
to
the
federal
question,
as
to
whether
there's
a
violation
of
federal
law,
as
i...
this
is
not
an
instance
where
the
state
is
taking
tribal
property
but
rather,
the
question
is
whether
the
united
states
took
the
state's
entitlement
and
instead
vested
it
to
the
tribe,
and
so
the
very
essence
of
the
claim
isn't
a
violation
of
federal
law,
but
a
determination
of
what
that
federal
law
means,
and
this
is--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
the
state
does
not
have
an
ability
to
take
tribal
land.
if
these
are
tribal
lands,
state
authority
would
not
extend
to
them.
this
case
is
most
analogous
to
a
tortious
interference
type
situation
where
there
is
competing
claims
as
to
what
federal
law
means,
and
we're
simply
trying
to
resolve
this,
very
much
similar
to,
say,
the
oregon
v.
hitchcock
case,
in
which
the
state
claimed
ownership
of
lands
under,
i
believe
the
submerged
lands
act,
and
the
court
said
no,
that
was
prohibited
because
it
was
an
action
as
to
the
title
of
lands
in
the
united
states.
the
state
would
contend
that
the
officer's
suit,
the
traditional
officer's
suit
as
we
think
of
it,
going
back
to
the
united
states
v.
lee,
is
premised
on
the
notion
that
it's
a
state
affirmatively
acting
in...
as
a
private
citizen
to
take
its
property,
and
that
it's
a
taking
that
brings
those
actions
into
play,
and
the
rationale
of
lee
is
that
we
need
that
kind
of
rule
to
avoid
the
tyranny
of
the
government
simply
confiscating
state
property...
or,
i
mean,
private
property
for
benefit
of
state
governmental
actions.
we
contend
that
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
that
concern
is
not
present
in
this
case
because
the
state
entered
into
possession
as
a
result
of
statehood,
and
it's
been
in
possession
for
over
a
century
with
respect
to
those
lands,
and
so
we
simply
don't
have
that
problem
before
us
today.
likewise,
as
to
whether
the
conduct
of
the
officer
is
unlawful,
which
is
a
premise
of
ex
parte
young,
there
is
nothing
in
the
conduct
of
the
officers
here
that
would
suggest
that
they're
violating
any
federal
law.
in
fact,
they're
operating,
as
i've
indicated
in
the
past,
consistent
with
the
federal
premise
of
these
equal
footing
doctrines
to
regulate
them
on
behalf
of
the
public
as
a
whole.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
if
the
tribe
is
right
on
the
merits
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
rights,
but
in
this
context
you--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--no,
your
honor.
in
determining
this
case
you
must
first
consider
the
applicable
law,
and
the
applicable
law
under
montana
v.
united
states
is
that
you
must
presume
state
ownership
of
these
submerged
lands
absent
an
express
congressional
conveyance,
and
until
that
is
established,
the
state
is
entitled
to
operate
as
it
has
in
the
past,
that
it
is
entitled
to
the
ownership
of
these
beds
and
banks,
and
until
that
issue
is
resolved,
it
is
impossible
to
state
that
the
state
officers
are
not
acting
consistent
with
federal
law.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that's
the
very
nature
of
the
tension
between
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
compact
made
with
the
states
and
the
federal
government,
is
that
the
states
are
to
be
free
from
suits
that
will
interfere
with--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that's
correct,
with
the
exception
created
by
ex
parte
young,
but
as
i
am
contending
today,
this
action
doesn't
fall
within
ex
parte
young.
the
purpose
of
ex
parte
young
is
to
enjoin
the
unlawful
enforcement
of
state
laws,
and
before
you
can
determine
that
the
actions
upon
which
the
officers--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that's
correct.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
and
we
don't
know
in
this
case
whether
there's
a
violation--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--but
we
do
know
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
state
ownership
in
that--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that
is
a
rebuttable
presumption,
but
nonetheless
it's
a
strong
presumption,
and
the
court
is
required
to
begin
with
that
presumption
in
any
analysis
of
an
equal
footing
conveyance
situation,
and
given
that
presumption--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
the
essence
of
what
we're
trying
to
contend
before
the
court
today
is
that
under
ex
parte
young
you
start
with
the
premise
that
a
well
pled
complaint
alleges
a
violation
of
some
federal
law,
a
supremacy
issue,
and
the
contention
we
make
today
is
that
there
is
no
supremacy
clause
question
here,
because
if
the
state
is
correct
and
you
are
required
to
assume
that
the
state
is
correct
because
of
the
presumption
until
it's
litigated,
then
the
state
is
acting
consistent
with
federal
law.
once
that
federal
law
is
determined,
as
it
was
in
treasure
salvors,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
go
forward
and
to
evaluate
the
merits
of--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
in
part
that's
our
argument.
we
contend
that
the
question
here
is,
whose
interpretation
of
federal
law
is
correct?
and
until
that
interpretation
is
resolved,
it's
impossible
to
say
the
officers
are
in
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
well,
your
honor--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--well,
certainly
a
party
says
that
in
an
ex
parte
young
situation.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--what
they
point
to
is,
rather
than
an
assertion
that
they're
acting
in
conformance
with
federal
law,
is
a
presumption
under
federal
law
that
they
are--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that
is
correct.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
but,
your
honor,
the
eleventh
amendment
serves
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
state
in
the
operation
of
its
sovereign
duties.
these
lands,
as
this
court
has
said--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
what
you
have
here
is
property
that's
been
identified
as
an
essential
attribute
of
sovereignty.
if
the
eleventh
amendment
is
to
serve
any
purpose
at
all,
it
is
to
protect
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
from
being
sued
in
a
court.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
yes,
your
honor.
just
to
complete
that
thought,
the
essence
of
the...
if
the
eleventh
amendment
serves
any
purpose,
it
serves
to
protect
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
and
its
operations
of
its
government.
if...
ex
parte
young
cannot
be
used
as
a
method
to
simply
sue
an
officer
and
to
infringe
upon
the
state's
authority.
in
this
action
the
only
way
relief
can
be
granted
is
if
you
directly
determine
the
state
is
without
title.
turning
to
the
second
question
that
we
have
presented
to
the
court,
we
want
to
make...
first
make
clear
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
we
are
not
seeking
a
determination
as
to
whether
congress
took
affirmative
action
in
this
case
to
defeat
the
state's
equal
footing
title.
rather,
our
contention
is
that
the
president
cannot
act
without
express
congressional
authority
to
defeat
a
state's
equal
footing
title,
and
we
point
back
to
the
sioux
tribe
case
in
which
it
is
specifically
stated
that
the
authority
of
the
president
is
limited
directly
to
a
delegation
of
power
from
congress,
because
the
operation
of
the
property
clause
is
vested
exclusively
in
congress.
so
if
in
sioux
tribe
the
court
found
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
president
to
convey
an
interest
in
property
to
a
tribe
of
uplands
which
are
public
lands...
i
want
to
emphasize
it's
public
lands
not
submerged
lands...
then
it's
also
likewise
and
even
axiomatic
that
with
regard
to
submerged
lands,
which
are
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
future
states,
that
the
president
could
not
act
to
defeat
that
title.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
thank
you,
your
honor.
one
quick
point
with
regard
to
the
eleventh
amendment
issue.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
a
question,
two
questions
that
were
posed
by
this
panel
to
mr.
givens,
one
by
justice
o'connor,
and
one
by
justice
ginsburg.
as
justice
ginsburg
rightly
points
out,
what
the
tribe
seeks,
and
it's
stated
in
their
response
brief
on
page
4,
what
remains
in
the
suit
is
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
idaho
officers
to
stop
their
violation
of
federal
law
and
to
quiet
the
title,
the
tribe's
title
against
the
world
other
than
idaho
and
its
departments.
and
as
justice
o'connor
rightly
observed,
the
essence
of
title
to
property
is
the
opportunity
to
possess
that
property,
and
that's
particularly
true
with
respect
to
sovereign
submerged
lands.
as
this
court
said
in
oregon
v.
corvallis
sand
&
gravel,
submerged
lands
cannot
be
compared
to
substantive
property
law,
but
rather
as
an
issue
substantially
related
to
constitutional
sovereignty
of
the
states.
the
unique
aspect
of
that
sovereign
title...
there
is
a
legal
title
and
a
public
title...
is
the
responsibility
of
the
state
to
manage
those
lands
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
if
the
officers
are
enjoined
from
carrying
out
that
sovereign
duty,
how
can
it
be
said
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
is
not
affected?
mr.
clive
j.
strong
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--tindal
is
a
much
different
case
than
the
case
we
have
before
us,
because
in
tindal
it
was
an
issue
where
the
officers
through
their
actions
came
into
possession
of
the
property.
these
officers
have
no
relationship
to
the
title
here.
the
title
passed
to
the
state
on
statehood.
we've
possessed
it
since
that
date,
and
so
the
officer's
duties,
what
they're
doing,
have
no
relationship
to
title
whatsoever,
and
so
the
only
way
you
could
bring
in
tindal
is
to
say
that
the
officers
are
taking
the
property.
how
can
it
be
said
that
they're
taking
the
property
if
they
have
never,
by
their
own
actions,
took
possession
of
the
land,
but
rather,
came
into
possession
as
a
result
of
the
constitutional
presumption?
mr.
clive
j.
strong
certainly
not,
your
honor.
if
the
united
states
had
felt
that
there
was
a
basis
for
making
a
claim
for
the
entire
lake,
it
could
have
brought
that
action
and
the
state
would
have
no
objection
to
that
type
of
lawsuit.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor,
but
the
reasonable
assumption
is
that
the
united
states
has
evaluated
that
claim
and
determined
that
there
isn't
a
federal
interest
in
the
northern
two-thirds
of
the
lake.
turning
to
the
last
or
second
question
we
presented
to
the
court,
as
mr.
givens
rightly
points,
that
his
theory
is
based
upon
the
idea
that
midwest
oil
somehow
gave
the
president
authority
by
acquiescence
of
congress,
and
it's
our
position
that
the
property
clause
powers
are
vested
exclusively
within
congress,
and
then
in
the
sioux
tribe
the
only
way
that
authority
can
be
delegated
to
the
president
is
by
an
express
action
of
congress.
this
is
particularly
true
with
regard
to
the
submerged
lands,
which
are
held
in
trust
for
the
future
states.
if
a
president
can
simply
unilaterally
take
those
lands
out
of
trust,
then
what
aspect
of
sovereignty
is
really
being
protected?
in
fact,
the
sovereignty
of
states,
they
would
have
no
way
of
protecting
themselves
against
such
a
withdrawal.
moreover,
midwest
oil
is
a
very
unique
case.
it's
limited
to
the
situation
in
which
the
president
is
withdrawing
lands,
public
lands
that
are
available
for
sale.
in
midwest
oil,
the
court
found
acquiescence
to
be
acceptable,
because
in
that
instance
no
third
party
was
being
injured.
the
state
of
idaho
is
being
injured
by
this
action
because
the
lands
were
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
state,
and
if
they're
taken
out
of
trust
and
conveyed
to
the
tribe,
then
the
state's
sovereignty
has
been
injured.
