--may
i
ask
a
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
on
which
you
rely?
do
you
read
that
as
requiring
that
the
suspension
continue
as
long
as
the
charges
remain
outstanding,
or
would
it
be
within
the
superior's
authority
to
interview
him,
find
out
the
facts,
and
say
this
is
obviously
a
mistake,
i'm
going
to
put
you
back
on
the
payroll?
would
the
regulation
have
permitted
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--my
question
is,
what
does
the
regulation
mean
with
regard
to
the
authority
of
the
supervisor
to
reinstate
the
man
before
the
criminal
charges
are
dismissed?
would
the
supervisor
have
that
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
preclude
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
a
hearing
might
have
been
valuable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
understand
why
it
might
not
have
been
valuable
even
before
they
were
dismissed
if
the
supervisor
would
have
had
authority
to
reinstate
him
knowing
the
full
story.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
do
you
think
is
the
better
view
of
the
regulation,
he
did
or
did
not
have
the
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
charges
remain
pending
for
3
or
4
weeks,
and
even
though
the
supervisor
was
convinced
that
they
were
going
to
be
dismissed,
he
still
had
to
keep
him
off
the
payroll.
that's
your
view
of
the
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
interrupt...
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
i
guess
i
have,
but--
[laughter]
but
just
pursuing
the
chief
justice's
point
for
a
moment,
if
you
took
the
third
circuit's
rule
and
said
that's
the
law,
you
can't
take
his
pay
away
until
you
at
least
give
him
an
opportunity
to
give
his
side
of
the
story,
he
can...
you
can
do
that
in
a
day
or
two,
so
it
may
be
that
only
a
day
or
two's
pay
is
at
stake
in
this
huge
constitutional
fight,
because
if
you
called
him
up
and
said,
hey,
joe,
what
happened,
and
he
tells
you
his
story,
he
says,
i'm
sorry,
that's
not
enough,
you're
arrested,
you're
off
the
payroll.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we're
not
talking
about
indefinite
pay.
we're
talking
about
pay
for
the
2
or
3
days
that's
necessary
in
order
to
give
the
fellow
a
chance
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story.
