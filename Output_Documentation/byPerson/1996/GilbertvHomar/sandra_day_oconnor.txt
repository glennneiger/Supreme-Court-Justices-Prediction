well,
the
problem,
ms.
mosley,
is
not
apparently
on
whether
the
suspension
can
occur.
i
don't
see
either
side
disagreeing
that
under
these
circumstances
the
officer
can
be
suspended.
i
guess
it
really
turns
on
whether
there
should
have
been
some
opportunity
promptly
to
discuss
the
pay
situation
during
the
suspension,
right?
i
mean,
that's
what
we're
really
talking
about,
not
whether
there
can
be
a
suspension,
because
i
guess
your
opponents
agree
there
could
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
this
case,
we've
never
had
a
determination
on
the
facts.
i
guess
it
turned
out
that
the
charges
were
dismissed
very
promptly,
but
there
was
no
opportunity
to
discuss
the
pay
situation
for
a
while.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
there
a
difference
between
the
suspension
of
duty,
performance
of
duty
and
the
deprivation
of
pay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
might
there
be
a
different
balance
between
the
two?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
fareri,
you
do
acknowledge,
do
you,
that
the
state
can
have
a
blanket
rule
for
law
enforcement
officers,
that
if
the
law
enforcement
officer
himself
or
herself
is
arrested
for
or
charged
with
a
felony,
that
the
duties
of
that
officer
can
be
immediately
suspended
subject
to
a
prompt
post
suspension
hearing.
you
agree
with
that.
i'm
not
talking
about
pay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
the
duties.
but
you
want
a
different
rule
invoked
if
the
suspension
is
without
pay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
subject
to
a
prompt
post--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
this
court
reached
that
decision
in
mallen.
i
mean,
we
upheld
an
immediate
suspension
and
permit
post
deprivation
hearing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
want
us
to
draw
a
different
line
between
somebody
who
has...
is
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
as
opposed
to
somebody
who's
arrested
based
on
probable
cause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
a
much
greater
interest,
of
course,
in
assuring
the
public
that
their
police
officers
are
not
indicted
for
felonies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
the
policy
is
at
least
as
great,
if
not
significantly
greater
than
in
mallen.
