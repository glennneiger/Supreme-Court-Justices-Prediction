justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
come
across
anywhere...
i'd
be
quite
curious.
the
last
time
the
court
said
that
kind
of
thing
was
i
think
in
goss
v.
lopez,
wasn't
it,
where
they
said,
all
it
is
you
just
give
the
student
a
chance
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story
before
you
suspend
him.
well,
how
is
it
worked
out?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
basically
school
districts
don't
feel
inhibited
in
suspending
children?
have
there...
have
you
come
across
anything--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
says
whether
school
districts
do
or
do
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
haven't
found
it.
have
you
found
anything...
in
working
on
this,
it's
such
a
close
analogy
that
i'd
be
awfully
curious
if
you
found
something,
and
the
answer
is
you
haven't.
you
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
to
the...
what
i
think
is
your
main
argument?
i
take
it
judge
serokin
wrote,
a
governmental
employer
may
not
suspend
an
employee
without
pay
unless
the
suspension
is
preceded
by
some
kind
of
pre-suspension
hearing.
he
means
never,
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
i
would
like
to
know
whether
there
aren't
some
circumstances
where
you
could
suspend
him
without
a
preceding
hearing.
a
bank
guard
at
fort
knox
robs
fort
knox
and
is
charged.
we're
not
sure,
but
he's
charged
formally.
a
teacher,
state
university,
sexually
assaults
a
student
and
is
charged.
a
policeman
is
a
major
drug
dealer
and
is
charged.
the
authorities
say,
there's
a
charge.
we
therefore
have
probable
cause
to
think
he
did
it.
we
will
give
him
a
prompt
post
suspension
hearing
where
he
can
say
everything
within
one
pay
period
and
give
him
his
money
back
unless
we
think
that
he
really
is
guilty.
okay?
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
the
reason
they
want
to
do
it
is
because
they
think
it's
impossible
to
run
a
police
force,
a
university,
or
fort
knox
with
people
like
that
having
been
charged
on
the
payroll
doing
their
job.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
say,
oh,
just
don't
pay
them,
they
laugh
at
that
and
say,
what
do
you
mean?
if
we
send
him
a
paycheck
it's
a
paid
vacation.
of
course
the
taxpayers
want
to
have
people
who
are
paid
at
work
doing
something.
now,
that's
the
argument,
and
i
want
to
hear
your
response.
your
honor,
i
think
even
in
those
circumstances
where
it's
absolutely
clear
that
there's
been
some
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
employee
that
there
is
always
a
value
to
the
pre-suspension
process.
and
i
think
the
reason
there
should
be
pre-suspension
process
is
because
the
wage
earner's
interest
in
his
employment
is
so
critical
and
so
important,
and
sometimes
a
matter
of
being
able
to
support
himself
and
his
family,
and
the
skin
off
the
nose
of
the
government,
so
to
speak,
is
so
slight,
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
loudermill
process,
that
i
would
argue
that
you
should
have
a
pre-suspension
process
even
in
those
types
of
cases
that
the
court--
--suppose
the
employee
doesn't
ask
for
one?
suppose
in
one
of
justice
breyer's
hypotheticals
that
the
employee
does...
who
has
the
burden...
i
take
it
that
you're
saying
that
in
every
case
the
employer
must
take
the
initiative,
even
if
the
employee
didn't
ask
to
have
any
kind
of
pre-deprivation
hearing.
is
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
follow
up
my
question
with--
--mr.
fareri,
i
guess
there
are
two
really
separate
questions
here.
one
is
whether
you
need
a
pre-deprivation
hearing,
and
the
second
one,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
your
answer
to
this
is,
whether
you
can
continue
the
deprivation
until
the
charge
is
dropped
or
resolved.
in
other
words,
it's
no
big
deal
i
suppose
if
you
say
you
can
suspend
without
pay
but
you
have
to
provide
a
prompt
post-deprivation
hearing,
which
means
in
2
or
3
days
he
gets
a
hearing.
that's
not
the
state's
position.
as
i
understand
the
state,
the
state's
position
is,
we
don't
have
to
provide
a
hearing
until
the
felony
charge
is
resolved
either
up
or
down,
which
is
really
not
a
prompt...
i
mean,
depending
upon
how
promptly
the
felony
is
disposed
of.
what
is
your
position
on
the
latter
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
exactly
the...
what
i
was
trying...
i'm
quite...
i'm
trying
to
focus
on
something
with
my
question,
which
is,
you
responded
with
the
answer
it's
a
slight
governmental
interest,
and
that's
the
point
that
i'm
uncertain
about,
and
would
like
you
to
follow
up
on.
the
contrary,
i
take
it,
would
be,
what
are
you
talking
about,
slight?
if
we
have
to
keep
people
on
the
payroll
who
have
done
and
been
charged
with
serious
crimes
such
as
i've
mentioned,
we
can't
do
that
as
a
practical
matter.
people
will
think
we're
giving
them
paid
vacations.
that's
a.
b
is,
slight?
let's
look
at
what
happened
after
goss.
people
get
mixed
up
in
applying
these
things
and
they
think
they
have
to
give
students
tremendous
full
hearings
with
lawyers
before
they
can
even
kick
them
out
of
class.
now,
i
don't
know
if
what
i've
just
said
is
accurate.
it
may
be
false,
but
that's
why
i
want
your
response--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
those
two
separate
things,
one,
in
administering
complicated
things
like
separating
pay
from
suspension,
everything
gets
mixed
up
and
before
you
know
it
they
cannot...
they
feel,
the
school
districts,
that
they
can't
really
suspend
a
child
without
a
tremendous
full-blown
hearing,
even
though
that's
not
what
the
court
said.
that's
a,
and
b
is
what
you'd
call
confidence
in
the
public
service
in
not
giving
people
paid
vacations
for
a
month
when
they've
been
charged
by
grand
juries,
or
arrests
for
serious
crimes.
those
are
the
two
things,
that
what
you
said
slight,
so
i'm
trying
to
say,
is
it
slight?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
you
mean
suspending
without
pay...
without
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you're...
i
take
it
that...
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth...
that
you're
saying
there's
no
circumstance
in
which
simply
phoning
the
person
before
suspending
him
without
pay
and
to
say,
is
there
some
exceptional
circumstance,
is
there
something
to
your
side
of
the
story,
you're
saying
that
that's
always
required.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
be
very
simple.
it
could
be
very
simple,
a
telephone
call,
what's
your
point...
what's
your
point
of
view.
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
basically
what
you're
arguing.
