ms.
ann
hubbard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
third
circuit's
per
se
rule,
any
public
employee
who
is
suspended
without
pay
in
advance
of
a
hearing
is
entitled
to
seek
money
damages
for
a
constitutional
violation.
this
is
contrary
to
the
court's
precedents,
and
could
impair
the
federal
government's
interest
in
needed
flexibility
in
employment
matters.
because
of
deficiencies
in
the
record,
however,
we
believe
the
court
should
reject
the
third
circuit's
rules,
vacate
its
judgment,
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
i'd
like
to
focus
first
on
why
mallen
and
barchi
tell
us
that
a
government
may,
in
appropriate
circumstances,
suspend
an
employee
without
pay
and
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
ms.
ann
hubbard
under
mallen
and
barchi,
and
as
well
under
mathews,
you
have
to
identify
the
government
interest
in
prompt
action.
ms.
ann
hubbard
we
think
it's
an
easier
case
to
say
that
you
could
do
it
with
a
law
enforcement
officer.
ms.
ann
hubbard
it's
unclear.
i'm
not
sure
why
the...
that
would
be
defensible.
ms.
ann
hubbard
generally--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
generally,
if
the
government
suspends
an
employee
with
pay
it
does
not
implicate
a
protected
property
interest,
so
you
would
not
have
to
go
through
this
balancing
test.
we
think
mallen
and
barchi
are
properly
understood--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--it
doesn't
if
it
can
satisfy
the
mallen
and
barchi
test
that
it
had
a
compelling
interest
or
adequate
interest
to
suspend
them.
ms.
ann
hubbard
i
think
it
would
be
harder
with
a
groundskeeper.
i
mean,
this
court
has
already
identified
other
circumstances...
if
it's
a
bank
director
accused
of
fraud.
if
there's
a
public
safety
concern.
ms.
ann
hubbard
it
may
well
be,
justice
scalia.
i'm
not
here
to
defend
the
governor's
code
in
all
of
its
applications.
what
i'd
like--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--justice
scalia,
you
have
identified
one
of
the
primary
problems
with
the
third
circuit
rule.
the
effect
of
the
rule
is
that
even
if
the
government
constitutionally
can
suspend
you,
it
constitutionally
is
required
to
pay
you
in
all
instances,
and
we
think
this
is
not
compatible
with
the
court's
precedents
or,
indeed,
with
our
basic
understanding
of
the
employment
relationship.
ms.
ann
hubbard
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
believe
that
where
there's
any
doubt
about
which
way
the
balance
would
tip,
the
prudent
employer
can
protect
itself
by
suspending
the
person
with
pay
for
the
time
necessary
to
decide
whether
or
not
further
action
is
warranted.
ms.
ann
hubbard
no,
justice
kennedy.
we're
saying
that
the
employer
always
has
the
option
to
dispel
any
constitutional
doubt
by
suspending
the
employee
with
pay,
but
if
the
employer
concludes
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
that
falls
within
mallen
and
barchi
and
it
is
permissible
to
suspend
the
employee
without
pay,
then
if
that
determination
is
correct,
it
should
not
be
liable
for
damages.
ms.
ann
hubbard
we
think
there...
it
is
the
nature
of
a
balancing
test
that
there
will
be
hard
cases,
and--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--that's
very
often
the
case,
justice
stevens.
this
is
the
minimal
loudermill
hearing,
and
it
would
not
in
most
cases
be
so
burdensome
to
call
the
employer
in.
ms.
ann
hubbard
that's
absolutely
correct,
but
we
do
believe
that
if
this
is
a
mallen
barchi
case
and
the
government
was
justified
in
suspending
him
without
a
hearing,
even
during
that
period
between
the
suspension
and
the
hearing,
if
the
suspension
was
lawful
in
that
he
was
given
all
the
process
he
was
due,
the
employer
is
not
constitutionally
required
to
pay
him.
the
nature
of
the
property
right
at
issue
here
is
the
right
to
continue
to
work
and
to
earn
a
living.
ms.
ann
hubbard
it
might
well,
but
in
the
balance
that
you're
proposing,
you're
positing
1
or
2
days'
pay.
in
other
cases
it
may
take
longer
to
resolve
the
issue,
as
in
mallen
or
barchi,
for
instance.
ms.
ann
hubbard
right,
but
there
may
be
government
justifications
for
having
to
postpone
even
a
loudermillstyle
hearing
for
a
week
or
two,
and
we're
just
saying
that
the
court
needs
to
use
its
framework
for
balancing
those
questions.
ms.
ann
hubbard
from
the
federal
government's
perspective--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--it's
worked
out
very
well.
ms.
ann
hubbard
oh,
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer,
i
can't--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--i
can't
speak
for
the
school
district.
ms.
ann
hubbard
no,
sir,
i
haven't.
ms.
ann
hubbard
right,
and
the
general
practice
with
the
federal
government
is
to
suspend
employees
with
pay.
the
one...
assuming
that
the
employee
is
a
nonprobationary
employee,
and
unless
there
are
national
security
issues
at
stake,
we
do
suspend
with
pay.
ms.
ann
hubbard
i...
that
is
one
factor.
there
could
be--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--i
prefer
to
say
that
the
federal
government
is
just--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--it
could
be
if
there
were
a
circumstance
that--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--if
i
may,
justice
kennedy,
one
factor
could
be
fiscal
constraints.
for
instance,
if
a
university
could
demonstrate
here
that
it
could
not
both
pay
mr.
homar's
salary
and
pay
a
substitute
during
that
interim,
there
could
be
a
public
safety
concern.
ms.
ann
hubbard
i
think
that's
the
exceptional
case,
but
there
may
be
room
for
fiscal
constraints--
ms.
ann
hubbard
--that's
correct.
with
my
time
remaining...
oh.
