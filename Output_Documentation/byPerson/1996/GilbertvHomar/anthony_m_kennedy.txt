justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
do
not
apply
this
to
every
state
employee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
with
respect
to
all
employees,
or
just
police
officers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
don't
have
a
balance,
because
you
began
by
telling
us
that
this
was
a
police
officer
and
that
that's
important,
and
i
can
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
say
it
applies
across
the
board
to
all
employees.
that's
the
rule
you're
defending.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
just
make
it
clear?
you
are
saying
that
the
rule
you
want
us
to
adopt
is
that
there
is
an
across-the-board
rule
that
is...
that
meets
constitutional
requirements
for
a
state
to
suspend
any
employee
who
is
charged
with
a
felony
without
a
hearing
and
without
pay.
isn't
that
your
submission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
the
state
may.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
you're
not
arguing
for
the
broad
rule
that
i
suggested
at
the
outset
of
my
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
case-by-case
rule
for
every
employee,
depending
on
who
he
or
she
is,
you
might
as
well
have
a
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it,
then,
the
rule
you're
going
to
submit
to
us
is
that
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
employee
and
the
work
that
the
employee
does.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
does
the
government...
the
government
does
not
have
an
interest
in
suspending
any
employee
who's
been
arrested
and
charged
with
a
felony
without
a
hearing
and
suspending
without
pay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
that.
that's
why
i'm
asking.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
the
government
have
to
give
somebody
a
paid
vacation
if
they've
been
charged
with
a
felony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
the
government
show
this
compelling
interest,
other
than
if
it's
not
a
policeman,
if
it's
a
groundskeeper?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
suspending
the
person
with
pay.
so
you're
saying
that
the
presumption
should
be
that
you
can
only
suspend
with
pay,
unless
there's
no...
unless
the
mathews
balance
is
undoubtedly
in
favor
of
the
state.
that's
the
rule
you
propose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
can't
tell
us
whether
the
cases
are
easy
or
hard,
how
is
the
employee's
supervisor
to
do
it?
i
mean,
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
that's
a
factor,
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
federal
government
and
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
more
money,
that's
a
factor
that
we
tell
the
third
circuit
it
has
to
start
weighing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
know
that
it's
not
going
to
be
able
to
show
that
for
a
3-day
suspension.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
say
goodbye.
thank
you,
ms.
hubbard.
[laughter]
mr.
fareri.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
mathews
v.
eldridge
hearings
are
not
to
determine
what's
constitutional
or
not.
they're
to
determine
what
the
facts
are
under
a
balancing
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
we
hypothesize
that
it's
an
adequate
and
defensible
interest
for
the
government
not
to
have
police
officers
who
are
under
criminal
charges
enforcing
the
law
then
it
is
constitutional,
so
i
think
you're
avoiding
the
question
when
you
say
what
the
hearing
is
going
to
establish.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
you
have
to
say
that
it's
unlawful
for
the
state
to
have
the
policy
of
suspending
officers
that
are
under
criminal
charges.
