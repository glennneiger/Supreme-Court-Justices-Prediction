justice
antonin
scalia
then
what
use
is
the
government
code?
i'm
really...
i'm
having
a
hard
time
understanding
what
use
you're
making
of
that.
is
it
your
position
that
the
government...
that
the
governor's
code
makes
it
unnecessary
to
have
a
hearing,
because
it
applies
universally,
however,
you
concede
that
in
some
cases
that
may
be
unconstitutional?
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
are
defending
the
proposition
that
it
is
constitutional
to
fire,
or
to
suspend
without
pay,
any
state
employee
upon
his
or
her
arrest
for
a
felony?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that's
what
the
governor's
code
says.
if
you're
arrested
for
a
felony,
you're
suspended
without
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
is
constitutional
with
regard
to
all
state
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
comes
back
to
my
original
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
applies
to
all
employees,
but
you
say
it
may
not
be
constitutional
as
to
some
of
them.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
shouldn't
he
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
apply
the
governor's
code?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a
private
individual.
i
mean,
it's
different
when
the
government
as
regulator
is
knocking
a
private
individual
out
of
his
private
job.
can't
the
government
have
a
policy
and,
indeed,
don't
many
governments
have
such
a
policy,
we
do
not
employ
felons,
and
if
there's
any
suspicion
of
somebody
being
a
felon,
you're
off
the
payroll
until
that
suspicion
is
eliminated?
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
rule?
i
don't
care
if
you're
a
police
officer
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if
you
continue
paying
the
charged
felon,
can
the
government
get
the
money
back?
what
do
you
do
bring
a
lawsuit
to
get
back
the
money
you've
been
paying
after
the
person
is
finally
convicted
if
you
continue
paying
the
salary?
how
much
would
it
cost
you
to
bring
a
lawsuit
to
get
back
the
pay
that
you...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
substantial
government
interest
there,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
money
for
the
federal
government,
and
the
federal
government
can
print
more.
[laughter]
states
and
municipalities
can't.
they
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
have
an
automatic
budget-balancing
requirement.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
how
significant
that
interest
is
would
depend
certainly
upon,
you
know,
how
many
other
funds
the
individual
has.
i
mean,
if
this
individual
is
independently
wealthy
and
is
just
being
a
police
officer
for
fun,
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
very
important,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
how
much
money
he
had
in
the
bank?
is
that
the
kind
of
factor
we
ought
to
take
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
have
any
money
in
the
bank?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
mean,
is
that
the
presumption
you
can
make?
i
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
know
a
significant
number
of
wage
earners
who
could,
you
know,
support
themselves
for
quite
a
while.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
thought
the
question
was
not
whether
he's
innocent,
but
whether
he's
been
charged.
suppose
you
have
a
state
that
simply
adopted
that
rule.
if
you
were
charged
with
a
felony,
you
will
be
suspended
without
pay,
period.
so
the
only
issue
before
the
supervisor
is,
have
you
been
charged
with
a
felony?
do
you
need
a
hearing
for
that?
that's
a
matter
of
public
record,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
wouldn't
need
a
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
arguing
it
is
invalid
to
have
a
blanket
rule
that
if
you're
a
state
employee
charged
with
a
felony
you
will
be
suspended.
you
cannot
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
seperate
question,
for
which
we
might
have
to
remand,
but
assuming
that
that
is
the
state
rule,
you
say
you're
suspended
without
pay
when
you're
charged
with
a
felony,
that
rule
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
you're
arguing,
i
take
it,
that
you
need
a
prompt...
not
only
do
you
need
a
prompt
post
deprivation
hearing,
even
if
you
provide
the
hearing
2
days
after
the
suspension,
you
would
still
say
the
suspension
is
bad.
you
cannot
suspend
at
all
without
pay
until
you
have
a
hearing
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
with
saying
you
need
a
prompt
hearing
afterwards,
so
you'll
only
be
docked
for
2
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
two
days
isn't
that
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
guy's
in
the
wrong
job
if
he
can't
live
for
2
days
without...
you
know.
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
that's
not
what
the
state
says.
i
mean,
the
state
says
they're
entitled
to
keep
him
off
the
rolls
until
the
charge
is
resolved.
i
mean,
that
may
be
more...
you're
saying
the
whole
thing
comes
to
an
end
as
soon
as
the
hearing's
provided.
the
state
says
no,
not
only
don't
i
think
i
have
to
provide
a
hearing
promptly,
i
don't
have
to
provide
it
during
the
whole
period
that
the
person
is
still
under
charge.
that's
a
long
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
was
just
going
to
say,
how's
the
federal
budget
doing?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
a
million
dollars
here,
a
million
dollars
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what...
let's
keep
in
mind
what
the
suspended
person
here
would
argue
at
the
hearing.
what
would
you
expect
him
to
argue
at
the
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
response
to
that
is,
we
have
a
policy
that
all
state
employees,
or
at
least
police
officers,
will
be
suspended
if
they're
under
indictment.
we
do
not
want
indicted
police
officers
walking
around
enforcing
the
law,
and
since
they're
not
going
to
be
walking
around
enforcing
the
law,
we're
not
going
to
pay
them.
that
seems
pretty
reasonable
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but's
assume
it
is.
i
mean,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right...
well,
maybe,
maybe
not,
but
we
can
let
the
lower
court
resolve
it.
assuming
it's
a
policy
that
at
least
police
officers
will
be
suspended
without
pay
if
they
are
under
indictment,
what
would
the
hearing
have
consisted...
you
know,
what
good
would
the
hearing
have
done
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
it's
constitutional.
does
he
have
any
other
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
argument
you're
perfectly
willing
to
make.
i
mean,
you
think
that
that's
the
case,
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
suspend--
