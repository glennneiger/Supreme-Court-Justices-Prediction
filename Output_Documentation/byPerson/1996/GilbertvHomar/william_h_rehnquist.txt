chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-651,
james
e.
gilbert
v.
richard
homar.
ms.
mosley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
need
to
defend
a
rule
across
the
board,
i
take
it.
your
position
here
could
simply
be
limited
to
police
officers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mosley.
ms.
hubbard,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
of
the
benefits
of
the
third
circuit's
rule,
and
one
of
the
benefits
of
the
contrary
rule...
either
you
can
suspend
without
pay,
or...
is
that
it
avoids
all
the
kind
of
building
castles
in
the
air
and
factual
analyses
that
you
don't
know
when
the
supervisor
first
confronts
a
situation...
if
he
has
to
go
through
some
mathews
balancing
test
every
time,
it's
not
very
workable
in
the
real
world.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
might
be
a
2-week
situation
rather
than
a
3-day
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
something
to
be
said
for
a
rule
that's
more
or
less
automatic,
rather
than
requiring
the
supervisor
to
sit
down
in
each
case
and
read
a
study
like
this
that
says
a
third
of
these
people...
and
trying
to
figure
out
whether
this
employee
was
in
that
third
or
not,
for
either
saying
that
with
respect
to
a
police
officer
you
can
suspend
upon
arrest
without
pay
or
perhaps,
as
the
third
circuit
says,
you
can't
suspend.
there
are
just
a
great
deal
of
transactional
costs
in
this
balancing
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
how
about
your
brief,
your
red
brief
in
this
court?
did
you
challenge
the
rule
as
unconstitutional
there?
i
had
not
understood
the
brief
to
take
that
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
would
the
rule
leave
the
mallen
situation
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
how
would
your
rule
deal
with
the
mallen
situation?
i
mean,
which
we
have
said
was
permissible?
i
take
it
your
rule
would
allow
it
to
be
permissible.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
it
be
a
fortiori?
if
the
government
can
require
someone
to
step
aside
who
is
in
a...
simply
in
a
regulated
business,
ought
it
not
to
be
a
fortiori
with
a
government
employee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fareri.
mr.
o'duden,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
it
is
in
fact
in
the
government's
best
interest
to
do
that,
presumably
the
government
will
do
that
without
being
told
that
the
constitution
requires
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
a...
i
don't
think
it's
a
good
constitutional
argument
to
say
this
is
really
not
only
in
the
employee's
best
interest
but
in
the
employer's
best
interest,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
employer
presumably
can
look
out
for
his
own
best
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--certainly
a
supervisor
isn't
in
a
position
to
make
any
intelligent,
informed
decision
about
whether
a
policy
is
constitutional
or
not.
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
this
very
quick
telephone
call
and
the
guy
at
the
other
end
says,
of
the
telephone
says,
your
policy's
unconstitutional.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'duden.
the
case
is
submitted.
