mr.
gregory
o'duden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
if
i
may
by
discussing
the
issue
of
what
governmental
interests
are
at
stake
in
the
situation
that
we
face
in
this
case.
we
think
that
the
court's
cases
are
quite
clear
that
in
order
to
satisfy
its
burden
of
denying
somebody
a
pre-deprivation
hearing
the
government
has
to
show
that
there
is
a
significant
administrative
burden,
and
the
argument
that
we
hear
today
is
really
a
general
argument
that
suggests
that,
as
justice
breyer
put
it,
we
can't
do
this
because
if
we
do
the
public
will
be
outraged.
we
don't
denigrate
or
trivialize
the
argument
that's
made
by
the
state,
but
we
think
that
the
long
experience
of
the
federal
government's
practice
defeats
the
argument,
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
rule
that
we
advocate
here
today
has
been
the
routine
practice
for
many,
many
years,
and
there
has
been
no
suggestion
at
any
point
that
the
public
has
in
any
way
been
outraged.
justice
scalia,
are
you--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--the
federal
budget
isn't
doing
well,
your
honor,
but
i
can
assure
you
it's
not
because
people
are
being
given
loudermill-type
hearings,
and
i
think
it's
also
important--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--no,
i
don't
think
it
translates
into
that
at
all,
and
i
think
there's
one
other
important
thing
to
be
kept
in
mind
here.
if
an
erroneous
decision
is
avoided,
what
does
that
do?
that
saves
the
government
money,
because
it
means
that
in
that
situation
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
go
out
and
hire
a
substitute,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
expend
the
resources
to
train
that
substitute
and,
of
course,
it
also
means
that
it
avoids
what
could
be
the
very
significant
cost
of
having
to
pay
that
employee
back
pay.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
i
wish
the
world
were
that
simple,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
recognized
in
goss
v.
lopez
that
notwithstanding
the
good
intentions
of
those
who
are
in
a
position
to
impose
discipline,
it
often
doesn't
work
out
that
way,
and
that's
why
we
have
the
constitution,
to
defend
citizens,
to
defend
employees
from
deprivations
of
their
property.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--the
reason
that
we're
talking
about
the
employer's
interest
at
all
is,
of
course,
we're
faced
with
having
to
deal
with
the
mathews
test,
and
therefore
we're
having
to
respond
to
the
government's
assertion
that
their
interests
are
somehow
compromised
by
giving
somebody
a
pre-deprivation
hearing.
i
think
it's
important
in
looking
at
this
case
for
all
of
us
to
keep
in
mind
what
the
due
process
framework
here
is.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
in
this
situation,
i'm
putting
aside
the
issue--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--i'm
putting
aside
the
issue...
well,
he
wasn't
indicted.
i'm
putting
aside
here
the
issue
of
the
governor's
code.
he
could
say
that
he
was
at
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time,
that
he
wasn't
guilty,
that
he
was
innocent.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
of
course,
that's
not
the
policy
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case,
your
honor.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
code,
as
my--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--okay.
you're
moving
now
to
a
hypothetical
situation.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
if...
assuming
that
were
the
policy,
that
your
hypothetical
is
true,
one
of
the
things
that
he
could
have
argued
is
that
the
policy
was
unconstitutional.
he
could
have
made
that
argument
to
the
decisonmaker.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
in
essence
what
your
hypothetical
sets
up
is
a
situation
where
there
is
no
point
to
the
hearing.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
okay,
and
you're
assuming
that
it's
constitutional--
[laughter]
so
you're
talking
all
of
the
arguments
out
of
the
employee's
hands.
in
that
case,
obviously,
there
is
no--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no.
i
think
i
said
that
if
those
were
the
facts,
then
there
would
be
little
point
to
the
hearing
at
all.
in
fact,
there
would
be
no
point
to
the
hearing.
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
those
are
not--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--ultimately
he
would
be
reduced
to
making
that
kind
of
argument.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
suspending
without
pay,
yes.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes,
given
the
fact...
given
what
this
court
has
said
about
the
significance
of
the
fact
of
an
arrest.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
well,
in
this
situation,
where
the
code
calls
for
a
suspension
to
the
extent
practical
that
may
well
give
the
supervisor
pause
before
he
goes
ahead
and
imposes
that
action.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i'm
sorry--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--that's
right.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes,
your
honor,
that
is.
with
respect
to
the
mallen
case,
since
that
has
come
up
here,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
in
my
remaining
moments
that
mallen
does
not
reach
the
issue
that
is
presented
here.
mallen
obviously
turned
on
the
court's
very
real
concern
about
there
being
an
actual
government
interest
that
was
going
to
be
jeopardized,
namely,
public
confidence
in
the
banks,
the
concern
about
protecting
bank
depositors.
there
was
a
congressional
finding
on--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--there
is
a
public
interest--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--your
honor,
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out,
that
interest
is
addressed
by
removing
the
employee
from
his
duties.
it
does
not
follow
from
that,
however,
that
the
state
has
established
an
adequate
justification
to
deprive
that
employee
of
his
pay.
that
is
a
separate
matter,
and
those
justifications
that
are
asserted
here
by
the
government
do
not
justify
its
summary
deprivation
of
the
employee's
pay.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
yes,
and
in
fact
the
record
here
does
show
that
the
employee
here
did
in
fact
grieve
under
the
collective
bargaining
procedures
his
suspension,
and
that
is
yet
another
fact
that
belies
the
petitioner's
last-minute
argument
here
that
this
code
is
actually
binding.
we
think
it's
very
clear,
based
on
the
undisputed
record
in
this
case,
that
this
governor's
code
was
in
no
way
binding
on
the
petitioners.
it
obviously
wasn't
binding
on
the
decisionmakers,
and
the
university's
own
rules
of
conduct,
if
i
may
make
one
final
point,
they
provide
that
before
a
person
is
to
be
suspended,
he
is
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
his
defense.
that
again
is
in
the
recbrd
of
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--okay.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
that's
quite
right.
it
puts
it
in
the
position
of
being
able
to
focus
on
whatever
post-deprivation
procedures
may
be
warranted.
it
would
mean
that
it
would
not
have
to
bargain
for
those
pre-deprivation
rights.
that
is
quite
correct,
your
honor.
unless
there
are
further
questions--
