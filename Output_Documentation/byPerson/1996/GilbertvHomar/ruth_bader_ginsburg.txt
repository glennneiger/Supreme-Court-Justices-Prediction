justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would--
--ms.
mosley--
--excuse
me.
--it
was
my
understanding
that
the
third
circuit
wasn't
saying
you
must
have
a
full
dress
hearing,
just
give
the
officer
an
opportunity
to
say
why
he
shouldn't
be
payless
during
the
suspension
period,
just
an
opportunity,
i
think
the
words
were,
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
neither
was
this
regulation
that
you're
relying
on.
that
sort
of
comes
in...
it's
barely
there
until
your
brief
in
this
court,
and
the
deposition
of,
what
was
his...
mr.
levanowitz?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--said
that
he
used
it
not
as
a
law
but
as
a
guide
among
other
guides,
so
it
doesn't
sound
like
it
follows
like
the
night
the
day.
at
least
that
wasn't
how
the
personnel
supervisor
conceived
it.
he
thought
it
was
just
one
of
the
guides
he
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
had
there
been
no
governor's
code,
you
would
lose.
is
that...
then
you're
relying
on
the
governor's
code
as
the
reason
why
there
should
be
no
opportunity
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
so
important
that
he
shouldn't
have
an
opportunity
just
to
say,
it
was
the
wrong
place,
the
wrong
time.
i
was
totally
innocent.
i
was
visiting
a
friend.
and
then
they
could
make
a
determination
based
on
the
police
chief's
experience
with
this
man,
but
here
he
was
just
told,
you
will
be
payless.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
value
is,
he
could
say
to
his
immediate
boss
at
the
university,
look,
i
was
visiting
a
friend.
i
had
no
idea
of
this.
there
was
no
warrant
for
my
arrest.
there
was
no
judicial
officer
who
found
probable
cause.
it
was
the
wrong
time,
wrong
place
situation.
then
he
could
be
believed
or
disbelieved,
but
at
least
he
would
have
had
a
chance
to
tell
his
story.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
hubbard,
you
went
through
a
lot
of
ifs,
and
i...
following
up
justice
stevens'
question,
if
the
employee
is
arguing
all
i
want
is
a
chance
to
tell
my
side
of
the
story,
all
that's
involved...
all
that's
at
stake
for
the
government
is
a
couple
of
days,
at
most,
of
my
pay,
why
doesn't
any
balance
work
in
favor
of
the
employee?
the
government
can
take
him
out
of
the
job,
and
the
only
question
is
the
pay
for
a
couple
of
days.
why
doesn't
the
employee
win
on
that
kind
of
balance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
say
the
only
process
that's
due
is
a
chance
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story,
period,
no
full
evidentiary
hearing.
that
can
come
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
a
closer
analogy
that
you
were
just
about
to
bring
up,
how
the
federal
government
works.
it
has
these
hearings
within
a
week,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fareri,
the...
that
rule,
the
automatic
rule
that
there
must
be
some
opportunity
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story,
it
isn't
entirely
clear
to
me
what
is
entailed,
how
much
it
costs
the
state.
so
for
example,
if
the
position
is,
the
state
says,
you've
been
arrested.
you've
been
charged.
does
the
state
have
to
do
anything
more
at
that
point?
they
could
say,
now
tell
us
your
reason,
but
you
told
us
that
there
has
to
be
a
notice.
he
did
have
notice.
a
reason...
is
the
reason...
is
it
an
adequate
reason
for
the
employer
simply
to
say,
you've
been
charged,
and
then,
okay,
you
have
a
justification.
tell
us.
is
there
anything
more...
is
there
any
more
process
that's
due
the
employee
than
what
i
just
described?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
but
you
just
answered
that
you
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
scalia--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
believe
you
said
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
that
that
would
be
the
rule,
but
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question
as
well
i
suppose
you'd
have
to
say,
no,
it's
not
enough.
it
would
satisfy
the
rule,
but
it
wouldn't
satisfy
the
constitution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
did
eventually
get
pay.
was
that
prompted
by
anything
other
than
the
goodness
of
the
university's
heart?
was
there
any
union
involvement
in
getting
him
that
pay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
a
bargainable
subject,
the...
what
will
happen
to
an
employee
when
there's
a
charge
of
misconduct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
this
case,
wasn't
it?
this...
homar
did
not
ask...
he
said,
am
i
suspended,
but
he
didn't
ask
if
he
could
have
a
hearing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying...
it
was
the
bank
that
decided
not
to
pay
him.
the
only
thing
that
the
government
required
was
the
suspension.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
o'duden,
is
this
something
that
a
union
could
bargain
about
with
the
public
employer,
say,
now
we
want
to
have
a
code.
you
can
suspend
people,
of
course,
but
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
hearing
before
you
take
away
their
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
this
is
a
bargainable
subject,
then
i
take
it
what
you're
asking
for
here
is
to
say
the
constitution
takes
care
of
it,
the
union
doesn't
have
to
bargain
for
it,
so
the
union
can
bargain
for
other
things,
because
the
constitution
will
require
in
every
case
some
kind
of
hearing
before
pay
is
removed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
answered
my
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--earlier
that
a
union
could
bargain
with
a
public
employer
not
to
take
away
people's
pay
without
some
kind
of
hearing.
now,
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is,
if
the
due
process
clause
does
that
job,
then
the
union
doesn't
have
to
bargain
for
it.
it
can
bargain
for
something
else.
