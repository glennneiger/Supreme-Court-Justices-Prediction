justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
the
suspension
automatic?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
things
i
think
we're
arguing
about
in
this
case
is
whether
you're
really
applying
this
regulation,
and
the
regulation
that
you
set
out
on
page
3
of
your
brief
makes
the
suspension
automatic
on
arrest.
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
substantive
objection
to
the
regulation
as
such,
so
if
it's
this
regulation
which
is
being
applied,
then
the
only
real
issue
of
fact
would
be,
was
the
person
arrested
or
charged
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
yet
if
i
understand
what
the
other
side
is
saying,
they're
saying
that
really
isn't
the
standard
that
they
apply,
that
in
fact
it's...
number
1,
it's
not
consistently
applied.
number
2,
if
it
had
been
alone
what
was
being
applied
the
individual
would
have
been
reinstated
when
the
charges
were
dropped,
and
he
wasn't,
and
so
they're
saying
that
the
real
issue
in
the
case
is...
or
in
the
case
of
a
suspension
is
not
whether
there
was
an
arrest
or
charge,
but
something
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
arrest
or
charge,
and
if
the
latter
point
is
true,
then
there
really
is
a
lot
more
to
talk
about
at
a
hearing
than
the
mere
fact
of
the
arrest
or
not.
could
you
comment
on
that
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
apply
the
regulation
to
everybody,
and
so
far
as
you
know,
are
there
any
exceptions
in
the
sense
that
the
inquiry
might
have
been
more
far-ranging,
or
there
might
have
been
a...
an
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
suspending
authority?
do
you
know
of
any
such
instances?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
if...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
if
that
is
so,
and
that
is
the
standard,
why
wasn't
he
simply
reinstated
when
the
charges
were
dropped?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
we
want
to...
i
mean,
what
we
want
to
know
is
whether
in
this
case
there
should
have
been
a
hearing
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
let
me
suggest
an
argument
to
you
and
get
your
response
to
it.
the
argument
would
be
this.
if
you
had
a
regulation
that
provided
every
employee
shall
be
suspended
upon
arrest,
suspended
without
pay
upon
arrest,
and
you
applied
that
across
the
board,
and
that
regulation
as
such
was
not
attacked
as
somehow
being
unconstitutional,
then
you
would
have
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
look,
the
only
issue
is
whether
there
was
an
arrest
or
not,
and
there's
not
likely
to
be
a
mistake
about
that.
or
if
you
had
a
regulation
that
said,
every
police
officer
shall
be
suspended
upon
arrest,
you
could
make
the
same
argument.
the
only
question
is
whether
there's
an
arrest.
but
if,
in
fact,
this
regulation,
which
seems
to
cover
everybody,
does
not
in
fact
cover
everybody,
then,
at
least,
it
seems
to
me
there...
or
the
argument
would
run
that
in
any
given
case
an
employee
could
say,
look,
it
shouldn't
apply
to
me.
you
apply
it
to
some,
you
don't
apply
it
to
others,
regardless
of
what
it
says
on
its
face,
and
it
shouldn't
apply
to
me,
and
that's
a
much...
i
suppose
a
much
more
complicated
issue
than
whether
there
was
an
arrest
or
not.
if
that's
the
issue,
there
would
be
a
good
reason
for
having
a
pre-suspension
hearing.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
going
to
defend
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
does
apply
to
everybody.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
we
should
leave
that
issue
for
the
circuit
or
the
district
court
on
remand.
if
we
were
to
do
that,
let
me
ask
you
what
your
answer
to
this
question
would
be.
if
we
assume
that
the
governor's
code
of
conduct
requiring
the
automatic
suspension
at
least
applies
to
all
law
enforcement
officers
and
should
be,
by
its
terms,
enforced,
then
the
only
issue
would
be
in
a
given
case
whether,
in
fact,
there
had
been
an
arrest
or
a
charge.
under
those
circumstances,
do
you
believe
that
a
pre-suspension
hearing
is
necessary
if
pay
is
not
to
be
continued
during
the
suspension?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
issue
would
turn
solely
on
the
question
whether
there
had
been
an
arrest
or
a
charge,
and
is
that
the
kind
of
issue
upon
which
there
is
a
sufficient
risk
of
error
to
require
the
pre-termination,
the
pre-suspension
hearing?
i
mean,
there's
a
pretty
good
argument
that
that
issue
is
so
simple,
it's
so
unlikely
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
mistake
about
that,
that
it
really
would
be
justified
to
say
no,
the
hearing
could
take
place
afterwards.
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
thought
you
gave
me
a
different
answer.
i
thought
in
the
simple
case
that
i
put,
in
which
the
only
issue
is
whether
a
law
enforcement
officer
had
been
arrested
or
charged
with
a
felony,
that
in
that
case,
even
though
there
would
be
a
suspension
without
pay,
the
issue
was
so
simple
that
there
was
no...
and
the
risk
of
error
so
slight
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
pre-suspension
hearing.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
ever
charge,
or
did
your
side
ever
charge
in
this
case
that
the
rule
was
substantively
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
you
just
didn't
know
that
that
was--
