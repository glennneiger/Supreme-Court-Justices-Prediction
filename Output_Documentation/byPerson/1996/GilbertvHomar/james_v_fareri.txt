mr.
james
v.
fareri
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
speaking
about
this
governor's
code
of
conduct
that
is
so
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
commonwealth
in
this
case.
it
was
not
brought
up
or
even
raised
until
this
case
got
to
the
supreme
court.
if
you
look
in
the
joint
appendix,
mr.
levanowitz
testified
that
he
did
not
even
feel
that
he
was
obliged
to
follow
the
governor's
code
of
conduct.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
governor's
code
of
conduct
is
not
even
relevant
for
the
determination
as
to
what
quantum
of
due
process
should
have
been
afforded
mr.
homar
under
these
facts.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
if
pay
is
not
to
be
continued,
yes,
your
honor,
because
that
would
be
an
issue,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individual
can
continue
to
receive
his
pay.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
i
would
concede
that
if
the
governor's
code
of
conduct
is
in
the
case
and
it
is
supportable
and
it
is
constitutional,
then
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
souter,
on
that
point.
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
general
rule
crafted
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
is
fundamentally
correct.
however,
the
court
need
not
reach
that.
it
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
propriety
of
such
a
rule
in
order
to
affirm
the
holding
below.
rather,
the
result
reached
below
may
be
obtained
by
applying
the
three
mathews
factors
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
i'd
like
to
go
over
those
with
the
court
now.
the
first
mathews
factor
is
an
assessment
of
the
private
interest
that
would
be
affected.
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
submit
that
there
is
a
very
strong
private
interest
that
mr.
homar
had
of
continuing
his
employment.
the
court
has
recognized
in
many
cases
in
the
past
such
as
the
loudermill
case,
then
the
mallen
case,
that
an
employee
has
a
great
private
interest
in
continuing
with
their
employment
and
continuing
to
receive
their
wages.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
a
wage
earner,
i
think
you
can
make
certain
presumptions
about
somebody
who
is
earning
a
wage.
i
think
it's
a
fair
presumption--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--i
don't
know
whether
he
had--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--i
think
the
presumption--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--i
think
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
your
honor,
there's
a
study
that
indicates
that
approximately
a
third
of
all
wage
earners
in
this
country
now
live
essentially
from
paycheck
to
paycheck.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
mr.
chief
justice,
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more.
that's
why
we
think
that
the
rule
crafted
by
the
third
circuit
is
correct.
you
cannot
engage
in
a
mathews
balance
in
each
and
every
case.
as
you
indicated,
that
is
completely
unworkable
in
the
real
world.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
i
think
what
you're
describing,
justice
ginsburg,
is
a
loudermill-type
process,
and
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
employee
is
entitled
to
anything
more
than
that.
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
something...
it
couldn't
be
any
more
simple.
notice...
notice
of
the
problem,
and
an
opportunity
to
say,
i'm
innocent.
this
gentleman
did
not
have
even
that
simple
process
in
this
case.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
given...
if
you
take
the
court's
premise
that
that
rule
is
valid--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--then--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--then
you
wouldn't
need
a
hearing.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
i
think
that's
invalid,
and
additionally
i
don't
think
that's
applicable
in
this
case,
for
the
reasons
i
indicated
previously.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
that's
my
position,
yes.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
absolutely
correct.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
my
answer
was
given
assuming
that
that
rule
was
valid--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--that
if
you're
arrested
then
you
would
be
suspended.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
i
believe
so.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
well,
we
didn't,
your
honor,
because
the
rule
was
never
raised
until
i'm
standing
here
right
now.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
the
rule
has
not
been
raised
in
any
past
pleadings,
in
any
past
briefs.
the
first
time
that
it
was
raised
was
in
the
brief
to
this
court.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
we
didn't,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
being,
again,
we
feel
strongly
that
the
rule
is
not
in
the
case,
because
the
personnel
director
himself
testified
that
he
did
not
rely
on
the
rule.
and
additionally,
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
indicated
when
they
were
asking
counsel
for
the
state
a
question,
after
the...
all
charges
were
dismissed,
and
all
charges
were
dismissed
6
days
after
his
arrest
for
insufficient
evidence
after
a
preliminary
hearing,
the
human
resources
director
continued
on
with
his
suspension
for
a
period
of
23
days,
during
which
mr.
homar
did
not
receive
his
pay.
now,
if
they're
going
to
rely
on
that
rule,
why
didn't
they
lift
that
suspension
and
reinstate
him
after
all
charges
were
dismissed?
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
the
union
was
involved,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
there's...
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
can
tell
the
court
that
that
does
provide
for
a
grievance
process.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
the--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--i
would
say
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
because
i
think
there
are
some
employees
who
probably
aren't
sophisticated
enough
to
ask
for
one,
and
i
think
because
the
governmental
employer
is
in
the
position
of
running
the
workforce,
that
that
should
be
their
obligation
to
provide
one.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
that's
correct,
and
that
exemplifies
what
i'm
saying.
i
don't
think
he
had
the
knowledge
to
know
that
he
was
even
entitled
to
that,
and
he
didn't
understand
what
his
rights
were
until
after
he
consulted
counsel,
which
was
sometime
after
that.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
on
whether
or
not
the
post
suspension
process
would
satisfy
in
lieu
of--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--the
pre-suspension
process?
mr.
james
v.
fareri
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--well,
but
it's--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--your
honor,
the
cost
to
the
government
is
so
slight,
and
again,
the
interest
of
the
employee
is
so
great.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
there
are
some
different
facts
in
mallen,
your
honor.
for
instance,
in
mallen
there
was
a
grand
jury
indictment.
in
this
case
what
you
have
is
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
my
client
happened
to
be--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
a
bright
line...
a
bright
line
rule
should
be
drawn.
however,
that...
i'm
just
bringing
that
factor
up
over--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
rule
takes...
the
rule
would
take
into
account
the
very
important
interests
of
the
employee
in
continuing
with
his
wages
as
recognized
by--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--well,
mallen
does
not...
again,
mallen
does
not
deal
with
the
governmental
employer
either,
as
in
this
case.
mallen
is
a
federal
regulation--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--well,
with...
the
issue
with
the
government...
governmental
employer
that
you
don't
have
where
there
is
a
regulation
of
private
business
is
the
issue
of
the
pay.
the
government
does
not
have
an
interest
in
whether
or
not
the
employee
would
continue
to
be
paid
where
there's
private
regulation.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
the
regulation--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--didn't
speak
one
way
or
another
to
the
pay,
and
i
think
the
decision
may
even
indicate
that
that
was
left
to
the
bank,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
case
that
indicates
whether
or
not
the
suspension
was
with
or
without
pay.
mr.
james
v.
fareri
well,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--your
honor,
it
is
slight,
because
we're
not
talking
about
keeping
somebody
in
pay
status
for
a
period
of
a
month.
you're
talking
about
at
most
a
week,
maybe
even
less
than
that,
until
they
would
get
a
loudermill-type
process.
on
the
second
point,
to
the
extent
that
there's
confusion--
mr.
james
v.
fareri
--i
think
the
state
is
wrong,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
individual
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
heard
sooner
than
the
period
of
time
it
may
take
for
that
criminal
charge
to
be
adjudicated.
thank
you.
