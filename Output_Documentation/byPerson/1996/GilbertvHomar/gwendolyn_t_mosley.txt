ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
due
process
requires
a
public
employer
to
provide
a
hearing
in
every
instance
before
suspending
one
of
its
employees
without
pay.
the
third
circuit
held
that
a
loudermill-type
hearing
providing
for
hearing
and
a
notice
to
be
heard
must
be
given
to
an
employee
in
every
case
before
suspending
him
without
pay,
regardless
of
the
reasons
for
the
suspension,
regardless
of
the
governmental
interests
involved,
regardless
of
the
purpose
to
be
served,
no
matter...
regarding
the
substantial
assurance
of
reliability,
regardless
of
the
duration
of
the
suspension.
we
think
this
is
wrong.
we
think
that
the
better
rule
is
that
which
was
announced
in
mallen.
in
mallen,
the
court
said
an
important
governmental
interest
accompanied
by
substantial
assurance
that
the
deprivation
is
not
without
basis
may,
in
limited
circumstances,
justify
the
postponement
of
a
hearing
until
after
the
deprivation.
what
we
are
asking
for
here
is
for
the
court
to
make
explicit
what
was
suggested
in
mallen,
that
the
university's
interest
in
the
prompt
removal
of
a
police
officer
arrested
for
drug-related
charges
justified
mr.
homar's
suspension
without
a
hearing
and
without
pay.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
we're
suggesting
that
such
an
opportunity
would
be
useless.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have...
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
a
police
officer
who
was
arrested
on
very
serious
charges,
and
that
particular
arrest
itself
required
prompt
action,
just
as
in
mallen
the
court
said
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
arrest
is
enough
to
undermine
the
public
confidence
and
the
public
trust.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
yes.
in
our
case,
however--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--that's
right.
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
are
important
interests
furthered
by
his
prompt
suspension
and
his
prompt
suspension
without
pay.
the
government
had
important
interests
at
stake
here,
not
just
the
interest
in
promptly
removing
a
police
officer
following
his
arrest
on
drug-related
charges,
but
there
was
the
interest
in
maintaining
the
public's
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
police
force
and
the
police
officers'
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
police
force.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
with
respect
to
the
arrest
on
a
felony
charge,
we're
saying
that
the
arrest,
or
that
the
suspension
would
be
without
pay,
but
we're
suggesting--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--with
all
commonwealth
employees.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
correct.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
yes,
your
honor.
what
we're
saying
is
at
the
point
of
time
when
the
suspension
was
made,
there
was
only
one
issue,
and
that
issue
was,
was
there
an
arrest,
and
was
the
nature
of
the
charge
a
felony,
and--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
there
is
no
discretion,
and
that
this
particular
regulation
is
applied
in
every
instance
involving
an
arrest
of
a
commonwealth
employee
for
a
felony.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
well,
the
only
issue
then
is,
does
the
employee's
charge
or
arrest
fall
within
that
regulation,
and--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--your
honor,
that
particular
issue
simply
doesn't
appear
to
have
been
addressed.
it
was
not
addressed
by
mr.
homar.
it
was
not
addressed
by
the
district
court,
and
it
wasn't
addressed
by
the
third
circuit.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
yes.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
well,
we
understand
that
mr.
levanowitz
from
his
deposition
testimony
certainly
should
be
understood
as
saying
that
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
he
considered.
however,
insofar
as
he's
suggesting
that
he
has
discretion,
he
was
merely
wrong.
and
also,
we're
saying
that
although
we
did
not
place
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
existence
of
the
governor's
code,
that
is
certainly
referred
to,
and
that
particular
aspect
relates
only
to
the
issue
of
the
value
of
additional
process.
that
is
the
point
of
having
that
particular
code
of
reference,
or
a
code
of
conduct
in
the
case.
what
we're
suggesting
is,
in
the
balance,
when
you
talk
about
the
various
factors
that
you're
considering,
one
of
those
factors
is,
what
is
the
value
of
having
any
additional
process?
what
is
the
value
of
having
the
employee
come
in
and
say
anything--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--right.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
well,
no.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
we
have
a
rule,
and
there's
no
discretion,
so
as
to
that
element
of
the
balance--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--what
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
where
there's
an
important
interest,
and
there's
some
assurance
that
the
reason
for
the
action
taken
is
not
without
basis,
and
there's
a
need
for
prompt
action,
then
the
court
may,
in
those
instances,
suspend
without--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--the
state
may
suspend
without
pay.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
no.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
it
could
be,
because
clearly
the
removal
of
a
police
officer
on
charges
such
as
were
involved
here
is
a
very
important
issue.
however,
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
interests
implicated
by
some
other
employee
might
not
also
raise
very
fundamental,
compelling
interests
to
warrant
his
or
her
suspension
without
pay
as
well.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
there...
we're
not
really
arguing
for
a
new
rule,
or
the
announcement
of
any
new
kind
of
approach
in
these
types
of
cases.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
rules
that
have
been
in
force,
such
as
the
mathews
balancing
test,
and
the
rule
that
was
announced
in
mallen,
are
adequate
to
deal
with
this
particular
situation.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
well,
your
honor,
one
of
the
reasons
that
we're
suggesting
that
there
would
not
have
been
a
need,
or
there
would
be
no
value,
is
that
it
really
does
depend
on
what
the
purpose
or
the
function
of
the
action
is.
we're
saying
that
there's
nothing
new
with
respect
to
saying
that
due
process
is
a
flexible
concept.
there
is
no
rule
that
fits
every
single
situation,
and
that
in
fact
the
court
has
suggested
in
mallen,
or
in
mathews
and
other
cases
that
there
is
a
balancing.
there
is
a
balancing
in
every
single
situation.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
right.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
my
response,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record,
or
there
are
no
facts
of
which
i
am
aware,
that
suggest
this
particular
regulation
does
not
apply
in
every
instance
when
there's
been
an
arrest
of
a
commonwealth
employee
and
a
charge
of
a
felony.
in
that
particular
case,
the
inquiry
is
the
same.
it
is
whether--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--it
does
apply
to
everyone.
it
does
apply
to
everyone,
so
the
inquiry
at
the
point
of
consideration
of
what
to
do
once
you
receive
that
information
is,
you
know,
is
this
a
commonwealth
employee,
has
there
been
a
formal
charge,
and
is
that
charge
a
felony?
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
no,
we're
not,
your
honor.
what
we're
suggesting
is,
as
i've
stated,
is
there
is
a
balancing.
there
has
to
be
an
important
governmental
interest
which
we
do
have
here.
we
do
have
reliable
information
which
would
be
supported
by
the
state
police
arrest
of
this
person,
so
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
action
taken
is
baseless.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
no,
i
don't
think
that
i'm
conceding
that
in
some
cases
it
could
be
unconstitutional.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
value
or
the
purpose
of
our
reliance
on
the
governor's
code
is
to
suggest
there
is
no
discretion,
so
there's
no
need
for
any
hearing.
any...
there's
no
point
in
dispute
at
that
time.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
what
i'm--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--what
i'm
suggesting--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--what
i'm
suggesting
is,
that
regulation
relates
to
all
employees,
but
there
are
other
factors
in
the
mathews
balance
that
must
be
considered--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--in
addition
to
whether
or
not--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--right.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
that's
correct.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
element,
that
factor,
that...
the
factor
on
which
that
particular
regulation
bears
some
interest
may
not
require
the
same
result,
given
that
the
governmental
interest
involved,
the
need
for
prompt
action,
for
instance--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--well,
we've
stated
that
the
interest
of
the
government
in
getting
this
person
off
the
campus
cannot
be
challenged,
it's
very
important,
and
that
we
don't
see
that
there's
a
dispute
to
that.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
well,
there
are
two
aspects
to
that.
the
one
is,
what
is
the
value?
if
the
triggering
event
is
his
arrest,
and
his
arrest
on
a
felony
charge,
there's
no
dispute
to
that,
and
mr.
homar
has
never
disputed
that.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
we're
suggesting
that
it's
not
even
the
credibility
of
this
police
officer
that's
important
at
this
point.
the
governmental
interest
in
having
his
prompt
removal
is
in
protecting
the
public's
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
police
force.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
we're
suggesting
that
is
what
requires
the
promptness
of
the
action.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
yes.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
we're
suggesting
that
insofar
as
the
suspension
was
based
or
triggered
by
the
arrest,
and
on
a
felony
charge,
that
it
would
be
of
no
value
to
have
a
hearing
prior--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--prior--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--the
regulation
does
not
speak
to
that
and
does
not
preclude
that.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
it
does
not
preclude
that.
however--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--it...
we
don't
think
that
the
hearing
would
have
been
valuable
on
the
question...
in
this
particular
case,
the
criminal
charges
were
dismissed,
so
at
that
point
we
must
concede,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
why
this
was
not
done,
that
there
may
have
been
some
value
in
having
a
hearing
once
those
criminal
charges
were
dismissed.
but
on
the
issue
that
we
are
here--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--the...
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
supervisor
would
have
had
full
authority
to
reinstate
prior
to
the
resolution
of
the
criminal
charges,
and
if
that
was
your
question--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--and
if
that's...
if...
i--
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
--i
do
not
believe
that
the
regulation
gave
him
the
authority
to
have
a
hearing
and
reinstate
prior
to
the
resolution
of
the
criminal
charges.
if
the
purpose
and
the
reason
for
the
suspension
was
his
arrest
on
criminal
charges
and
a
felony.
ms.
gwendolyn
t.
mosley
that's
my
view
of
the
regulation
regarding
the
whole
point
of
the
hearing,
or
the
inquiry
at
that
time.
as
we
have
stated
mallen,
in...
the
court
in
mallen
suggests
just
the
mere
fact
that
there's
been
an
arrest
itself
is
sufficient
to
threaten
the
public's
confidence
in
the
police
force.
what
we're
saying
here
is
that--
