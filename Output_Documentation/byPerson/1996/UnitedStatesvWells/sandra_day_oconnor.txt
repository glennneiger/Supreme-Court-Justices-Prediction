mr.
dreeben,
most
courts
of
appeals
have
said
materiality
is
an
element,
haven't
they?
that's
the
majority.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
they're
wrong.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
was
the
jury
instruction
given
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
where
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
no
objection
was
made
to
these
instructions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
government
was
satisfied
with
the
statement
that
it
is...
materiality
is
an
element?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
how's
the
question
preserved
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
decided
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
judge
ever
later
tell
the
jury
he
had
decided
it
was
material?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
instruction
become
the
law
of
the
case
somehow?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
we
look
at
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
could
say
the
circuit
below
was
wrong
but
leave
it
open
on
the
remand
for
that
application
of
doctrine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thirteen
and
15?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--where
are
you
reading?
that's
in
the
indictment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
we
don't
have
to
even
decide
the
question
of
prejudice
here.
if
we
just
decide
what
the
certiorari
petition
asks,
we
can
just
say
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
in
error
and
leave
to
them
what
remedy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
of
course
the
text
just
doesn't
include
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
congress
may
be
aware
of
what
it
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
certainly
have
to
assume,
do
we
not,
that
our
assumption
must
be
that
congress
knew
what
it
was
saying--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--based
on
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
this
statute
does
contain
a
mens
rea
element.
it's
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
just
want
to
add
to
it.
