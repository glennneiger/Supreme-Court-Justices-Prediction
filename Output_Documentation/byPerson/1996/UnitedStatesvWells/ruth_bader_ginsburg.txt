justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
dreeben,
we
don't
have
directed
verdicts
in
criminal
cases,
and
this
judge
in
his
instruction
number
20,
if
you
were
sitting
on
the
jury,
wouldn't
you
think
that
the
judge
had
made
the
determination
that
the
representation
was
material,
because
the
judge
first
says
it
must
be
material,
and
then
he
says,
you
don't
worry
about
that,
because
that's
for
me
to
determine.
but
if
a
jury
is
to
come
in
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
or
not
guilty,
mustn't
the
jury
assume
that
a
judge
has
made
the
finding
that
this
was
material?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
if
your
interpretation
of
the
law
is
correct,
how
should
instruction
number
20,
which
is
on
page
42
and
43
of
the
joint
appendix,
how
should
that
have
been
trimmed?
what
should
the
judge
and
what
should
the
judge
in
the
future
instruct
in
these
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
like
to
make
sure
i
understand
you
correctly.
at
a
minimum
you'd
say
you
would
have
to
delete
the
two
paragraphs
of
the
instruction
that
deal
with
material
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
later
indictment
that
you
just
referred
to,
was
that
after
gaudin?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
it
would
have
been
rather
nervy
for
the
prosecutor,
given
the
law
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
before
gaudin,
to
go
flatly
against
the
law
of
the
circuit
in
the
indictment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
the
difference
here
and
in
the
kay
case,
where
the
court
said
that
it
doesn't
lie
with
someone
who
has
knowingly
made
a
false
statement
with
intent
to
mislead,
then
to
argue
that
the
information
wasn't
important,
that
congress
was
entitled
to
require
the
information
be
given
truthfully
and
without
intent
to
mislead?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting,
then,
that
in
order
for
congress
to
make
this
take
out
the
element
of
materiality
it
would
have
to
negate
that
expressly
by
saying,
and
materiality
is
not
an
element
of
this
offense,
because
if
it
doesn't
negate
it
then
the
courts
will
imply
it?
is
that
essentially
your
position?
