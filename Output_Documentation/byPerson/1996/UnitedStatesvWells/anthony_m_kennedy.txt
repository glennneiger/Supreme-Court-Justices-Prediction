well,
but
it
says
somewhat
more
than
that.
it
defines
what
materiality
is
a
few
sentence...
a
few
paragraphs
before.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
a
knowledgeable
jury,
as
i
think
justice
ginsburg
is
suggesting,
would
say,
well,
materiality
is
important
in
this
case,
and
it's
been
established.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
this
case
the
judge
said,
i
instruct
you
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
is
material.
he
didn't
say
that.
suppose
he
said
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
you
prevail,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
case
has
to
go
back.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
was
the
law
of
the
eighth
circuit
at
the
time,
and
the
government
has
a
number
of
these
prosecutions.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
frame
the
indictment
in
any
other
way
in
the
eighth
circuit.
