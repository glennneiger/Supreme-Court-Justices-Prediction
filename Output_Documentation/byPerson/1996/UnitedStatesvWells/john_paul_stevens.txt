with
respect
to
that
argument,
i
was
thinking
about
hypotheticals.
supposing
a
buyer,
borrower
went
into
the
bank
and
said,
i'm
a
yankee
fan,
because
he
knew
that
the
loan
officer
was
a
yankee
fan.
that's
the
crime.
that
would
be
enough,
wouldn't
it,
because
he
did
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
it
was
knowingly
false.
he
was
really
a
braves
fan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
theoretically,
would
be
ccvered
by
your
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
i
don't
seem
to
have
the
instructions
in
front
of
me,
but
would
you
help
me
on
this?
did
the
element
of
purpose
of
influencing
the
action
of
the
agency,
was
that
described
in
the
instructions
as
a
separate
element?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was,
and
the
jury
found
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
about...
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
the
judge,
i
think,
drew
a
distinction
between
statements
and
omissions,
and
he
said
an
omission
would
not
be
false
in
his
instruction
unless
it
were
of
a
material
fact.
now,
if
you
had
a
statement
which
was
literally
true
in
all
respects,
but
there
was
a
material
omission
that
made
the
overall
presentation
a
violation
of
the
statute,
would
it
not
then
be
necessary
to
show
the
omission
was
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
we
necessarily...
perhaps
it's
not
a
legal
argument...
are
concerned
about
the
consequences
of
a
case
if
we
don't
accept
your
position
maybe
we're
emptying
the
jails
of
a
large
number
of
prisoners
who'll
bring
2255
proceedings.
i
notice
in
this
case
the
defendant
got
2
years'
probation.
do
you
know
if
that's
a
typical
sentence,
or
typically
they're
longer
sentences
that
are
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
a
term,
do
you
remember?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask,
had
any
of
the
10
statutes
that
did
not
have
the
materiality
element
expressly
in
the
statute,
had
any
of
them
been
construed
judicially
to
include
such
an
element?
