stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
true,
it
is
rather
an
absurd
example.
i
don't
know
that
you
would
find
the
government
prosecuting
that.
what's
unreasonable
about
congress
saying,
look,
materiality
has
to
do
with
whether
the
statement
really
would
influence
the
bank.
purpose
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
defendant
intended
to
influence
the
bank.
we
don't
want
to
let
defendants
go
make
the
argument,
although
i
intended
to
influence
the
bank,
it
didn't
really
do
it,
so
we
want
to
take
that
out
of
the
case,
and
that's
what
this
statute
seems
to
say,
and
i
don't
really
understand
yet,
but
i
want
you
to
focus
directly
on
it,
what's
unreasonable
about
writing
a
statute
in
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
actual
point
is
the
same
as
justice
scalia's
on
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
don't
quite
understand,
if
you're
going
back
to
that.
the
instruction,
as
i
read
it,
defines
separately
and
completely
purpose
and
then,
having
turned
from
what
it
called
the
second
element,
namely
purpose,
it
then
turned
to
the
third
element,
namely,
falsity.
it
discussed
materiality,
and
refused
to
give
the
issue
to
the
jury.
the
government
says,
well,
the
judge
was
right
in
not
giving
it
to
the
jury
for
a
different
reason.
it's
not
part
of
the
statute,
and
there
was
no
prejudice
because
purpose
was
defined
separately
and
completely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
prejudice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
purpose
was
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
purpose
was
not
part,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
all
right,
but
where's
the
prejudice,
if
in
fact
the
judge
was
right
in
not
giving
the
materiality
issue
to
the
jury,
but
for
the
wrong
reason?
what's
the
prejudice
your
client
suffered?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
wrong
about
whether
materiality
is
an
issue
of
the
part
of
the
statute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you're
wrong
about
that,
what
prejudice
did
your
client
suffer
from
the
judge
having
mentioned
it
when
he
didn't
let
the
jury
decide
it?
