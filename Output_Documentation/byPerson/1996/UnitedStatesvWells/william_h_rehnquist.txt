chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-1228,
united
states
v.
jerry
wells
and
kenneth
r.
steele.
mr.
dreeben,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
under
gaudin,
too,
there
would
be
a
lot
of
2255
proceedings
in
cases
where
the
court
had
determined
materiality
for
itself
if...
by
people
who
had
previously
been
convicted--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
we
held
materiality
was
a
statutory
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
were
to
rule
in
your
favor
on
the
materiality
point,
mr.
dreeben,
is
the
instruction
point
one
that
could
be
determined
by
the
eighth
circuit
just
as
well
as
we
could
on
remand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
congress
wanted
trivial
misrepresentations
prosecuted
the
courts
would
go...
have
to
entertain
those
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
wyrsch,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
in
the
indictment,
isn't
it?
nothing--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
the
eighth
circuit
allowed
them
to
do
this.
perhaps
the
eighth
circuit
could
have
said
no,
but
we've
now
granted
certiorari
on
this
question
as
to
whether
materiality
is
an
element
of
the
crime,
and
i
hope
sooner
or
later
you'll
get
to
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
you
give
more
credence
to
a
legislative
history
or
a
report
than
the
actual
language
that
congress
has
used,
which
was
to
omit
a
requirement
that
had
been
present
in
some
of
the
other
statutes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
bad
intent
to
influence
the
bank
plus
a
false
statement
made
to
the
bank,
well,
that
may
be
a
somewhat
harsh
statute
in
your
view,
but
it's
certainly
not
ridiculous
or
absurd.
maybe
congress
just
wanted
to
clamp
down
on
people
who
made
false
statements
to
banks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
the
way
they
said
it
was
to
omit
the
word
materiality.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
common
law
or
is
that
statutory
construction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wyrsch,
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
95-1228,
united
states
against
wells,
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
