mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
initially
to
address
some
of
the
matters
that
were
brought
up
during
questioning.
first
of
all,
it
was
very
highly
contested
in
the
trial
court,
and
we
actually
briefed
it
on
appeal,
as
to
whether
any
of
these
statements
that
the
government
said
constituted
a
violation
of
a
conspiracy
to
make
a
false
statement
to
a
bank
or
the
substantive
violation
under
count
2
were
in
fact
material.
i'd
like
to
simply
indicate
very
briefly
that
with
respect
to
the
statements
made
to
o'bannon
bank
and
bank
iv
that
we
had
testimony
that
in
fact
the
lease
agreements
that
did
provide
that
a
lessee
would
have
the
responsibility
for
the
maintenance
was
in
fact
literally
true,
and
was
done
and
presented
to
the
banks
in
that
fashion
with
their
knowledge,
at
least
in
part
as
to
a
separate
agreement,
because
the
banks
wanted
to
be
not
held
responsible
for
those
obligations
under
the
second
agreement.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
signature
by
the
individuals
here
before
the
court
or
their
wives,
we
had
two
positions
on
that,
one
of
which
was,
it
was
not
required
under
federal
law,
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
material,
and
there
was
a
timing
issue,
timing
issue
meaning
they
didn't
require
that
until
after
there
were
in
fact
some
purchases
by
the
bank
of
the
income
streams
from
these
leases.
i'd
like
to
also
point
out
that
the
government
had
the
opportunity
in
the
lower
court
to
make
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
section
1014
required
a...
was
material.
it
is
true
under
the
ribaste
case
under
the
eighth
circuit
as
we
tried
the
case,
materiality
had
been
held
by
that
court
to
be
in
fact
an
essential
element
of
the
section
1014.
however,
as
the
government
has
pointed
out,
there
was
the
cleary
case
in
the
second
circuit,
and
the
government
elected
not
to
make
an
issue
of
that
in
the
trial
court.
in
fact,
materiality...
the
issue
of
materiality
permeates
this
case.
there
are
substantial
references
to
the
issue
of
materiality,
including
a
direct
statement
that
the
statements
that
were
made
to
these
banks
were
in
fact
material,
not
just
omissions.
in
addition
to
that,
instructions--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--that--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--it
is
contained
in
instruction
13,
i
believe,
your
honor,
and
in
instruction
15,
in
the
instructions
describing
the
offense
and
the
indictment,
those
were
set
forth--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--yes,
your
honor.
it
was
also
set
forth
at
length
in
the
indictment.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
at
page
40
of
the...
and
this
is
instruction
15...
there's
a
statement
that
jerry
wells
and
kenneth
steele
made
and
caused
to
be
made
false
statements
of
material
fact
to
o'bannon
bank
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
bank.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
that's
paraphrased
in
the
indictment,
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
well,
on
page
40,
at
paragraph
(b),
there
is
a
statement
to
that
effect.
on
the
bottom
of
page
40,
"in
accordance
with
the
conspiracy
agreement
made
in
1986
james
russell
knowingly
made
and
caused
to
be
made
a
false
statement
of
material
fact
to
bank
iv.
"
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
it
is
true
justice...
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
when
the
court
submitted
the
instructions
on
the
elements
later
on
it
only
referred
to
material
statements
in
terms
of
omission
when
it
described
the
elements,
that
when
it
gave
a
general
description,
and
it
had
to
because
much
of
this...
much
of
these
charges
from
the
indictment
had
been...
the
court
had
granted
an
acquittal
on.
he
had
to
redact
the
indictment,
and
so
then
when
he
described
it
he
read
this
to
the
jury.
when
he
went--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--we
are--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--well,
and--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--the
jury--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--your
honor,
the
jury
would
have
had
to
find
one
or
more
of
these
overt
acts...
this
is
at
section
371...
in
order
to--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--was
proven?
no.
the
instruction
on
whether
it
was
proven
or
not
was...
as
accurately
pointed
out
by
the
government,
was
in,
i
believe,
instruction
number
20.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
that's
correct.
it
is
true
that,
unlike
some
other
cases,
the
judge
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge,
did
not
say
i
have
found
materiality
as
a
matter
of
law.
in
fact,
he
had
done
that
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
so
all
that
he
did,
your
honor,
was
to
tell
them
it
was
not
a
matter
that
they
should
be
concerned
about,
but
the
problem
is
is
that
now,
having
heard
materiality
as
an
issue
throughout
the
trial,
having
heard
the
indictment,
or
sections
of
it
read
during
the
instructions,
and
then
having
the
judge
says,
don't
you
be
concerned
about
it,
don't
you
be
worried
about
it
at
all,
that
caused
substantial
prejudice
to
us,
and
we
did
object
in
the
trial
court.
now,
it
is
true
what
the
government
says
is
accurate,
although
we
briefed
the
issue
of
the
sufficiency
of
materiality
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
letter
brief,
and
this
was
after
all
briefing
had
been
done,
about
a
year
after
oral
argument,
roughly,
the
court
asked
us
for
a...
what
our
position
was
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
materiality
and
the
effect
of
this
court's
decision
in
gaudin.
so
we
said,
we
have
preserved
it
in
the
trial
court
under
existing
rules
as
to,
it's
still
on
appeal,
we're
entitled
to
have
the
benefit
of
that
opinion,
and
we
submitted
a
brief.
the
government
didn't
dispute
any
of
that.
all
they
said...
well,
the
most
part
what
they
said
was,
materiality
now
is
not
an
element.
this
is
after
they
asked
for
instructions
in
that,
after
they
did
not
object
to
any
of
those
instructions
in
the
court
below,
and
they
indicted
on
that
theory.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
the
government
subsequent
to
this
case
brought
an
indictment
against
one
of
our
clients
in
the
western
district
of
missouri
in
which
they
did
not
allege
that
materiality
was
an
element
of
section
1014.
and
then
what
they
did
was
is
that
when
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
they
said
it
is...
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
governs
whether
an
indictment
is
sufficient,
and
we'll
determine
later
on
whether
we
want
an
instruction
in
that
regard,
and
they
have
a
lower
court
opinion
to
that
effect,
so
they
had
that
opportunity.
they
could
have
indicted,
or
asked
the
grand
jury
to
indict
without
that
element.
they
could
have
argued
all
they
had
to
do
was
bring
an
indictment
under
the
language
of
the--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--it
was
after
gaudin.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
the
prosecutors
did
a
prudent
thing,
but
now,
having
done
a
prudent
thing
and
not
taken
the
bull
by
the
horns,
so
to
speak,
and
said
this
is
what
the
second
circuit
is,
we
don't
think
we
need
to
prove
it,
and
so
on,
they
should
not
now
be
permitted
to
say
we
want
to
retroactively
say
it
is
not
an
element--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--when,
in
fact,
that's
what
they
indicted
on.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--this
court
would
have
that
opportunity.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
it
could
send
it
back
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
say,
you
determine
whether
these
instructions
were
prejudicial,
and
if
the
court
were
determined...
or,
to
determine
the
issue
that
materiality
is
in
fact
not
an
element,
then
as
the
government
has
properly
said,
it
has
to
go
back
to
the
eighth
circuit
anyway
because
the
government
wants
a
substantial
sentence
imposed
in
this
case.
going
back
to
your
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
materiality
is
an
element
for
a
number
of
reasons.
we
cannot
ourselves,
as
we've
looked
at
it,
make
any
clear
determination
in
our
own
mind
that
when
this
statute
was
amended,
that
in
fact
congress
intended
to
omit
the
element
of
materiality.
there
were
some
13
statutes
at
the
time
that
the
consolidation
was
designed
to
bring
into
one
statute.
three
contained
a
requirement
of
materiality.
i
think
of
the
remaining
10,
seven
had
a
requirement
that
there
be
an
intent,
or
the
intent
element
was
for
the
purpose
of
influencing,
and
three
did
not.
the
reviser's
note
simply
says
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended
here,
and
if
that
was
the
case,
then
presumably
at
least
on
some
of
the
statutes
materiality
was
still
an
element.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
not
that
i
know
of.
we
have
looked
high
and
low
and
cannot
find,
other
than...
now,
there's
this
kay
case
which
is
before
the
court,
and
the
government
argues
that
the
kay
case
in
fact
has
language
in
it
to
support
the
idea
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
materiality
not
be
an
element.
we
think
that
the
kay
case
really
is
whether
actual
damage
is
an
element
of
the
case.
there
is
some
language
that
the
government
we
think
is
urging
upon
the
court,
and,
with
all
due
respect,
may
be
pushing
it
a
bit
too
far.
we
don't
think
the
court's
holding
in
kay
really
was
on
that
issue.
it
was
on
a
separate
issue.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
it
could
be
read
in
that
way.
it
also
could
be
read
as
mere
dicta
in
the
case.
it
also
did
not
precisely
say
that.
it
said
that
it
is
not
for
a
defendant...
or,
i
use
the
word
defendant,
but
it's
not
for
defendant
to
complain
that
the
information
was
not
important.
it
is
true
that
language
is
there,
but
it
does
not
determine
the
question
in
this
case.
it
actually
dealt
with
a
different...
a
somewhat
different
statute.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
several
things,
one
of
which
is
that
subsequently
congress
has
amended
this
statute
many
times,
and
has
never
come
forward
and
said
in
a
report
or
in
any
kind
of
a
legislative
history
that
materiality
was
not
an
element,
despite
the
fact
that
some
10
circuits
have
said
it
is
an
element,
and
we
think
that's
something
for
the
court
to
consider
with
respect--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--that's
correct,
but
that--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--it
may
be
aware
of
it,
or
it
may
not
be
aware
of
it,
and
we
don't
believe
that
congress
really
intended
that--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--i
don't
think
we
can
make
that
assumption.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
i
don't
think
it...
justice
o'connor,
that
that
ends
the
inquiry
at
all,
because
i
don't
think
it's
clear
what
congress
meant
by
it.
i
think
if
congress
did
intend
that,
they
could
have
expressly
said
that
in
some
kind
of
a
legislative
history
or
report,
and
they
didn't
do
that,
and
the
reviser
said--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--i
think
that
that
may
be
precisely
the
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i'm
not
certain
in
my
own
mind
that
this
legislative
history
indicates
one
way
or
the
other,
but
the
fact
that
when
we
look
at
the
statute
then
without
the
history
contains
no
element
of
materiality
did
not
end
the
inquiry.
it
did
not
end
the
inquiry,
for
instance,
for
this
court
in
staples,
and
it's
cited
in
justice
breyer's
article,
it's
not
cited
here.
in
green
v.
bach
laundry
this
court
said,
look,
we
want
to
look
here
to
make
sure...
to
find
out
whether
they
had
any
intent
or
not,
and
if
they
didn't
have
any
intent
one
way
or
another
to
cause
this
result,
then
at
that
point
we're
free
to
put
a
reasonableness
requirement
into
this.
this
court
on
many
occasions
when
it's
looked
at
the--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
it
would
be
absurd.
if
you...
the
government
is...
to
say
this
statute
is
saying
the
intent
to
influence
necessarily
involves
a
requirement
of
materiality,
or
involves
the
same
concept,
we
say
regardless
of
what
that
position
is
we're
still
entitled
to
reversal.
but
if
i
might
go
back
to
that,
there
are
others
that
say
that
if
you
look
at
the
literal
language
of
this
statute
it
just
says
intent
to
influence,
so
if
one
were
to
apply
for
a
loan
for
$5,000
secured
by
a
car
worth
$5,000,
and
you
put
on
the
loan
application
that
all
that
his
income
was
was
$60,000
when
in
fact
his
income
was
$100,000,
the
government
would
win.
why
would
they
win?
because
the
representation
of
60
was
in
fact
a
representation
that
they
intended
to
influence
the
bank
to
grant
the
loan,
but
it
was
a
false
statement.
it
would
be
an
absurd
result.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
well,
the--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--if
you
understate
your
income
and
you
agree
with
the
government
that
an
omission
is
also
part
of
this
statute,
and
the
bank
concludes
that
you
lied
about
it
for
some
reason,
for
instance,
you
say
i
didn't
lie
about
it
for
purposes
of
getting
this
loan,
i
lied
about
it
because
i'm
in
a
divorce
action,
a
different
purpose,
the
government
still
makes
its
case
under
that
example.
now,
it's
an
absurd
example,
absolutely,
mr.
justice--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--because
if
the
concepts
are
different,
and
if,
in
fact,
the
statement
made
about,
you
know,
the
yankee
example
that
was
given
there
earlier,
if
that,
in
fact...
does
the
government
have
the
opportunity
in
that
instance
to
prosecute?
absolutely.
if
this
court
says,
well,
it'll
never
bring
that,
which
is
the
government's
response--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--well,
i
understand
that,
but
i
still
say
that
if
the
concepts
are
different
no
one
should
be
subject
to
harsh
penalties,
which
is
what
many
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said.
no
one
should
be
subject
to
the
penalty
for
26,
31
months
if
he
had
a
bad
intent
but
it
was
immaterial
to
the
bank's
decision,
and
that's
why
the
courts
have
said
we
need
to
read
a
materiality
element
into
the
statute.
it
is
a
harsh
result.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
if
they
had
said
that,
mr.
justice...
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--perhaps
they
did,
but
perhaps
they
didn't,
and
we
can't
tell
from
this
legislative--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--that
language
can
be
construed
to
mean
that
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
materiality
element
with
respect
to
that
statute,
but
if
you
go
on
and
read
exactly
what
the
court
held,
which
was...
and
this
is
how
subsequent
courts
of
appeals
have
read
that
decision...
they
read
that
decision
as
meaning
actual
damage
is
not
an
element
in
the
case.
actual
loss
to
the
bank
is
not
an
element.
and
if
you
go
on
and
read
the
language
that
follows
the
language
that
your
honor
has
just
read,
then
that
is
the
holding
of
that
case,
and
there
have
been
subsequent
cases
that
have
said
that's
what
kay
says,
but
at
the
same
time
they
have
said,
and
this
is
the
court
of
appeals,
we
believe
that
materiality
is
an
element,
and
they
have
not
been...
they
have
not
believed
themselves
bound
by
the
kay
decision.
the
government
also
urged...
and
i
might
also
say
that
there
is
precedent
in
this
court
for
the
proposition
that
materiality
is
an
element
with
respect
to
the
immigration
statutes.
the
government
cites
the
kungys
case,
but
in
the
kungys
case
there
was
another
reference
to,
i
think,
the
fedorenko
case,
and
in
that
case
this
court
expressly
held
with
respect
to
an
immigration
statute
that
materiality
with
respect
to
misrepresentations
was
an
element,
and
cited
an
old
costello
case,
so
that
case
is
in
fact
before
this
court,
and
the
government
has
not
distinguished
it.
we
distinguished
the
kungys
case
on
the
basis
that
there
congress'
intent
was
to
reach
acts
that
constituted
a
bad
character
for
purposes
of
excluding
people
from
citizenship.
in
this
case,
we
don't
find
any
such
thing.
i
might
also
note
that
we
have
some
precedent
in
the
antitrust
statutes.
repeatedly
the
government
has
successfully
urged
on
this
court
and
many
lower
courts
that
a
price-fixing
agreement
is
per
se
a
violation
of
section
i
of
the
sherman
act,
and
yet
there
is
no
such
language
in
section
i
of
the
sherman
act
that
ever
says
that
a
price-fixing
agreement
is,
in
fact,
per
se
liability,
and
the
government
is
successfully
in...
is
successful
in
prosecutions
in
price-fixing
matters
of
taking
that
element
away
from
the
jury
as
to
whether
it
was
unreasonable
and
whether
or
not
the
defendants
can,
in
fact,
present
evidence
or
instructions
with
respect
to
those
kinds
of
agreements
being
subjected
to
the
rule
of
reason,
and
so
their
position
in
that
regard
is
inconsistent.
it
is
inconsistent,
we
believe,
with
a
number
of
decisions
by
this
court
where
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
intent
element
is
not...
does
not
have
any
intent
element,
but
in
the
staples
case
and
x-citement
video,
to
name
two,
and
in
the
liparota
case,
where
it
said
knowingly,
and
this
court
went
on
to
say
well,
liparota
means
more
than
simply
that
you
know
you're
dealing
in
food
stamps.
you
mean...
it
almost
means
you
have
to
have
the
intent
to
violate
the
law.
this
court
has
said,
i
don't...
we
are
not
stopped
by
looking
at
a
statute
that
does
not
have
an
element.
we
can
imply
an
element,
and
this
is
what
10
courts
of
appeals
have
done.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
it
does--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--we
want
to
simply
indicate
that
it
is
subject
to
a
reasonableness
requirement,
justice
o'connor,
and
it
is
subject
to...
and
that
reasonableness
requirement
in
this
instance
is
that
it
be
material,
and
that
the
statements
be
material.
there
are
certainly
many
different
avenues
to
punish
someone,
or
to
deprive
them
alone,
or
do
something
in
a
civil
arena
if
you
make
a
statement
to
a
bank
that
is
in
fact
immaterial
but
yet
is
false.
but
what
we
are
saying,
that
if
you're
going
to
subject
some
people,
and
then...
one
of
these
people
is
a
lawyer
of
longstanding
in
joplin,
missouri...
to
a
harsh
criminal
penalty,
then
the
statute
must
be
read
reasonably,
that
if,
in
fact--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--i
believe
so,
and
i
don't
have
the
citation
in
the
case
in
our
briefs,
but
there
was
a
case,
and
i
think
justice
scalia
offered
the
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
statute,
what
it
required
in
the
way
of
attorney
fees,
and
i
think
that
there
was
a
'38
case,
and
there
was
an
amendment
in
'46,
and
i
think
that
the
decision
was,
well,
they
must
have
meant
this
is
the
meaning
of
that
term,
because
in
fact
there
is
a
1938
case
and
then
a
report
with
respect
to
this
statute.
they
mentioned
that
case.
that
would
be
much
different
than
the
case
here.
this
case
has
no
legislative
history
to
indicate
that,
no
legislative
history
that
they're
adopting
the
kay
case,
no
legislative
history
that
they
are
in
fact
eliminating
materiality,
and
in
fact
what
there
is
are
reviser
notes
saying
we
don't
intend
to
make
any
subsequent
change.
now,
the
government's
argument
is,
we
win
3
to
10
on
that,
because
there's
only
three
statutes
that
said
materiality,
but
i'm
not
sure
a
numeric
argument
in
that
way
necessarily
is
a
clear
indication
that
they're
in
fact
intended
to
eliminate
materiality,
and
beyond
that.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
they
said
no
substantive
change.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
in
the
shabani
case,
which
the
government
has
urged
this
court
to
follow,
there
was
a
statement
in
that
opinion
that...
to
the
effect
that
one
of
the
canons
of
construction
is
to
look
at
the
common
law,
and
what
common
law
there
has
been,
certainly
since
these
folks
were
prosecuted,
has
been
that
10
circuits
have
said
that
materiality
is
in
fact
an
element.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
i
think
it
can
be
construed
probably
more
as
statutory
construction,
but
in
one
of
these
cases,
and
i
believe
it
was
the
williams
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
expressly
referred
to
coke
and
blackstone
in
the
common
law,
and
they
said
at
common
law
materiality
was,
in
fact,
an
element.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
so
i
think
it
was
both,
at
least
under
that
williams
case.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
i
think
one
of
the
10
under
the
kay
case
had
been
construed--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--as
not
re--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--that
was
the--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--yes,
that's
correct--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--justice,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge.
we
have
looked
high
and
low
on
that,
but
i
believe
that
the
only
statute
had
been
construed
was
the
one
on
the
kay
case,
i
believe.
i
will
tell
you
we
made
a
very
strong
effort
to
find
something
else
and
could
not.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
well,
we're
not
going
that
far
in
our
case.
we're
just
saying
that
the
survivor
statute
has
that
requirement,
and
i
will
say
that
we
have
the
support
of
at
least
10
circuits,
and
i
think
the
footnote
in
the
d.c.
circuit
case
recited
would
also
support
that.
i
might
also
add
that
in
the
williams
case,
which
this
court
decided
when
it
set
out
the
elements
and
the
government
to
some
extent
relies
upon,
in
fact,
made
reference
in
the
trial
court
to
instructions
that
did,
in
fact,
require
materiality,
and
the
court
didn't
comment
on
that
one
way
or
the
other,
so
i
don't
think
williams
is
a
good
case
for
the
government.
i
don't
really
think,
to
be
honest
with
you,
as
i
look
at
this
history,
that
they
really
considered
it
one
way
or
the
other.
there's
just
nothing
there
to
indicate
that,
and
i
think
that
was
a
reason
why
we
have
so
many
circuits
that
say
that
in
fact
materiality
is
an
element.
the
one
case
of
cleary
in
the
second
circuit
is
not
as
strong
for
the
government
as
it
urges.
it's
certainly
on
its
face
for
the
government,
and
we
don't
disagree
with
that,
but
they
at
some
point
say
in
any
event
materiality
is
for
the
jury...
or,
not
for
the
jury,
it's
for
the
court,
so
there
is
some
language
to
indicate
that
perhaps
they
don't
have
that
position.
in
candor,
in
another
statutory
section,
i
believe
section
287,
the
second
circuit
has
found
that
materiality
is
not
an
element
when
it's
not
in
the
statute.
i
might
also
say
that
the
government
in
this
case,
in
terms
of
the
posture
in
which
this
case
is
here,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
for
them
to
say
at
this
point,
given
what
they
did
in
the
trial
court,
to
actually
have
preserved
this
issue.
it
is
not
a
case...
that
is,
gaudin
and
whether
or
not
materiality
is
an
element...
that
will
cause
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
for
this
court
or
any
other
court
in
terms
of
collateral
consequences.
the
law
is
pretty
clear
that
these
matters
would
have
to
be
preserved
in
the
trial
court
and,
given
the
status
of
the
law
at
the
time,
i
don't
think
that's
a
serious
concern.
but
beyond
that,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
this
court
would
even
attempt
to
say
that
these
folks
that
were
tried
in
the
lower
court
in
fact
were
not
prejudiced.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--if
the
government's
correct,
that
purpose
necessarily
involves
the
issue
of
materiality
or
prejudice.
the
second
point
we
made
in
our
briefs,
mr.
justice,
is
that
on
the
false
statement
issue,
that
materiality
is
a
part
of
that
definition,
and
when
the
court
in
effect
took
materiality--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--purpose
was
not--
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
--on
the
false
statement
part.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
we
urge
you
not
go
beyond
the
purpose
requirement,
but
on
the
false
statement
requirement,
because
the
definition
of
false
statement
would
have
required
it
be
material,
when
the
court
took
that
away
from
the
jury,
it
took
away
from
them
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
these
statements
were
false.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
yes.
mr.
james
r.
wyrsch
first
of
all,
in
two
ways.
the
case
wasn't
tried
that
way,
and
we
have
a
jury
finding
now
that
necessarily
would
have
included
in
some
way
or
not
these
issues
of
materiality.
secondly,
with
respect
both
to
the
intent
issue
and
purpose,
and
with
respect
to
whether
it
was
false,
we
were
greatly
prejudiced
by
the
judge
taking
it
away
from
the
jury,
because
those
two
elements
necessarily
would
require
the
issue
of
materiality,
and
in
fact,
and
i
know
i'm
repeating
myself,
that's
exactly
what
the
court
defined.
in
it's,
and
i
think
it's
instruction
20,
he
said
that
a
false
statement
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
be
material,
and
then
he
said,
but
you're
not
to
be
concerned
with
that,
so
it
took
away
from
them
a
very
substantial
element
with
respect
to
that
matter,
and
therefore
we
were
very
substantially
prejudiced,
and
i
will
also
say
that
the
whole...
for
an
example
on
prejudice
and
whether
materiality
is
an
element--
