justice
david
h.
souter
but
kay
did
have
the
language
in
it.
i
don't
have
it
exactly,
but
it
was
something
to
the
effect
that
those
who
lie
cannot...
it
does
not...
it
is
not
open
to
those
who
lie
to
claim
subsequently
that
the
lies
were
unimportant
and/or
did
not
have
influence,
and
i
mean
that...
isn't
that
fairly
read
as
indicating
that
materiality
just
is
not
part
of
the
concept
that
the
statute
was
including?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
about
the
only
indication
that
we
have
as
to
what
any
of
those
10
statutes
might
mean,
and
i
would
suppose
congress
could
reasonably
say,
based
on
that
language,
dicta
though
it
may
be,
that
the
statutes,
in
the
absence
of
a
material...
or
in
the
absence
of
an
expressly
stated
element
of
materiality
would
not
have
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
i
remember
correctly
that
you
had
earlier
said,
i
think
it
was
in
response
to
a
question
of
justice
scalia,
earlier
said
that
none
of
the
10
had
in
fact
been
construed
to
require
materiality?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
to
require.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
the
others--
justice
david
h.
souter
--had
not
been
construed
on
the
point
of
issue
at
all,
had
they?
i
thought
that...
i
just--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
the
respondents,
wells
and
steele
on
charges
of
violating
and
conspiring
to
violate
section
1014
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code
which
prohibits
making
certain
false
statements
to
an
fdic
insured
bank.
the
indictment
alleged
that
the
respondents
had
provided
several
banks
with
false
information
when
they
applied
for
financing
to
save
their
financially-troubled
company.
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
the
district
court
told
the
jury
that
it
did
not
need
to
determine
whether
the
respondent’s
allegedly
false
statements
were
material.
that
is,
whether
the
statements
were
capable
of
influencing
the
bank’s
decisions
but,
he,
the
judge
would
make
that
determination.
the
jury
found
the
respondents
guilty.
the
respondents'
appealed
their
conviction
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
argued
that
materiality
is
an
element
of
section
1014
and
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
have
the
jury
determine
whether
any
false
statements
were
material.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
materiality
is
not
an
element
under
section
1014.
the
statute
does
not
explicitly
mention
materiality
but
instead
provides
simply
that
whoever
knowingly
makes
any
false
statement
or
report
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
in
any
way
the
action
of
any
bank,
the
deposits
of
which
are
insured
by
the
fdic
upon
any
application
commitment
or
a
loan
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
a
million
dollars
or
imprisonment
and
so
on.
we
find
no
reason
to
justify
departing
from
the
text
and
reading
materiality
element
into
the
statute.
respondents
have
made
two
other
arguments
which
relate
to
the
jury
instruction
and
the
indictment.
because
the
respondents
did
not
raise
these
issues
in
the
brief
they
submitted
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
them
in
its
opinion,
we
remand
the
case
to
allow
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
whether
the
respondents
properly
raised
those
issues
and
address
them
if
it
is
appropriate.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
