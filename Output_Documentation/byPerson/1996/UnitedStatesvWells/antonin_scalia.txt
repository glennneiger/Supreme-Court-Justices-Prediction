justice
antonin
scalia
they're
mostly
yankee
fans,
we
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben--
--mr.
dreeben,
in
asking
the...
in
telling
the
jury
to
disregard
the
materiality
question,
is
there
some
risk
that
the
judge
misled
them
as
to
the
purpose
finding
that
they
were
required
to
make?
that
is
to
say,
as
you
yourself
argue
to
some
extent
the
purpose
finding
hinges
upon
materiality.
it's
going
to
be
a
rare
case
where
you
have
a
purpose
of
misleading
an
institution
where
what
you're
talking
about
is
something
that's
immaterial.
i
mean,
the
yankee
hypothetical
is
an
unusual
one.
now,
why
wasn't
this
jury
misled
by
telling
them,
never
mind...
never
mind
materiality?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
do
any
of
the
statutes
that
you've
cited
to
us
earlier,
which
contain
an
explicit
materiality
requirement,
do
any
of
those
also
contain
a
purpose
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
mere
existence
of
a
purpose
requirement
does
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
materiality
being
a
requirement
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
last,
including
a
direct
statement
that
they
were
material?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
whom?
not
in
the
instructions.
justice
antonin
scalia
where--
--i
just
don't--
--is
that
in
the
joint
appendix?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
instructions?
where
is
it
in
13
and
15?
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
didn't...
no
jury
would
have
taken
that
as
a
finding
by
the
judge
that
it
was
material,
which
is
what
i
thought
you
were
saying
when
you
said
it
was
in
the
instructions.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
instruction
begins,
the
crime
of
conspiracy
as
charged
in
count
i
has
four
essential
elements,
which
are,
and
then...
you
know,
then
he
goes
through
the
elements,
and
then
he
says
that
as
part
of
four,
who
had
joined
in
the
agreement
knowingly
did
one
or
more
of
the
following
acts,
a,
b,
c.
he's
just
reciting
the
indictment.
i
don't
know
that
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--an
instruction
to
the
jury
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--materiality
was
proved.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
have
anything
else
besides
what
you've
just
read
which
would
convince
me
that
the
judge
told
the
jury
that
materiality
was
proved?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
just,
don't
pay
any
attention
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
green
v.
bach
laundry
we
found
the
provision
would
have
been
absurd
without
implying
a
statutory
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
one
wouldn't
be
absurd.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
falsity
has
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
influencing,
not
the
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
the
misrepresentation
that
is
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
to
grant
the
loan,
and
certainly
understating
your
income
is
not
likely
to
cause
the
bank
to
grant
you
the
loan.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
either
way,
the
government...
it
doesn't
prove
the
government's
case,
but
it
certainly
neutralizes
your
point.
i
mean,
that
statement
can't
be
true.
it
is
impossible
for
the
statement,
we
intend
no
material
change,
or
no...
did
they
say
material
change,
or
no
substantive
change?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can't
be
correct.
it
obviously
did
make
a
substantive
change.
it
either
eliminated
the
materiality
requirement
that
existed
in
the
three
statutes,
or
it
added
the
materiality
requirement
that
didn't
exist
in
at
least
four.
well,
that's
not
quite
correct,
because
isn't
it
true
that
the...
it
may
well
have
been
that
the
10
other
statutes
were
construed
the
way
sir
edward
coke
construed
the
common
law
crime
of
perjury.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
only
one
case
which
comes
out
the
other
way,
and
yet
you
maintain
that
all
of
those
statutes
have
a
subterranean
materiality
requirement.
