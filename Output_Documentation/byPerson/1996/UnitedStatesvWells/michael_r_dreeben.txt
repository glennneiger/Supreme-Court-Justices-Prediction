mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
1014
of
title
18
requires
the
government
to
establish
the
element
of
materiality
in
order
to
obtain
a
conviction.
section
1014
prohibits
any
person
from
knowingly
making
any
false
statement
or
report
or
willfully
overvaluing
any
land,
property,
or
security
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
any
one
of
a
number
of
covered
financial
institutions
in
any
application,
advance,
discount,
purchase,
purchase
agreement,
or
a
number
of
other
listed
transactions.
the
text
of
the
statute
does
not
require
proof
of
a
materiality
element.
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
that
explicit
element,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
concluded
that
an
element
of
materiality
should
be
implied
into
the
statute
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
being
applied
to
what
it
viewed
as
trivial
misstatements.
our
contention
is
that
that
holding
is
incorrect,
and
that
section
1014
does
not
require
proof
of
materiality,
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
text
of
the
statute
does
not
require
proof
of
materiality.
second,
the
history
of
the
statute
shows
it
to
be
a
consolidation
of
a
number
of
provisions,
the
vast
majority
of
which
did
not
require
proof
of
materiality,
and
third,
the
eighth
circuit's
policy
concerns
are
misguided
in
light
of
the
statutory
requirement
of
proving
that
the
individual
knowingly
made
a
false
statement
and
that
he
did
it
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
institution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
assuming
that
it
was
a
knowing
false
statement,
if
he
was
a
braves
fan--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
that
kind
of
hypothetical
would
theoretically
be
covered
by--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
would.
i'm
talking
about
what
in
fact
tends
to
get
prosecuted
under
section
1014,
and
in
our
experience,
federal
prosecutors
do
not
bring
cases
based
on
such
extraneous
or--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--currently,
yes.
but
our
main
point
is,
is
not
that
we
need
section
1014
not
to
require
proof
of
materiality
because
we
need
to
go
out
and
prosecute
immaterial
false
statements.
our
main
point
is
that
first
is
a
implied
element
of
a
statute
that
congress
did
not
require
us
to
prove,
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
read
into
the
statute
by
courts,
and
second,
it
can
cause
a
distraction
to
juries
considering
prosecution
of
false
statements
when
the
issue
of
materiality
is
in
the
case,
and
therefore
congress
had
particular...
had
valid
reasons
for
not
requiring
the
government
to
prove
the
materiality.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
exactly
right.
the
law
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
gaudin
was
fairly
tilted
against
the
government
under
this
statute
with
respect
to
implying
the
element
of
materiality,
but
that
element
was
determined
by
the
trial
judge,
not
by
the
jury,
and
as
a
result
there
would
be
an
arguable
constitutional
issue
for
a
defendant
to
raise
on
a
2255
subject
to
defenses
such
as
the
requirement
of
overcoming
the
cause
and
prejudice
hurdle
and
of
other
potential
issues
as
well,
but
our--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
they
are
wrong
for
three
basic
reasons,
as
i
began
at
the
outset.
let
me
first
address
the
text
itself.
the
text
of
section
1014,
which
is
set
out
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief,
does
not
require
any
explicit
proof
of
the
materiality
of
the
false
statement.
it
has
three
elements.
it
requires
that
there
be
a
false
statement,
which
is
the
actus
reus
of
the
offense,
and
it
has
two
intent
requirements.
it
requires
that
the
defendant
know
that
the
statement
is
false,
and
it
requires
that
the
statement
must
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
institution
with
respect
to
one
of
a
number
of
enumerated
financial
transactions.
in
contrast
to
the
deliberate
exclusion
of
any
materiality
element
from
this
statute,
congress
has
enacted
a
number
of
other
statutes
that
deal
with
the
problem
of
false
statements
that
expressly
require
proof
of
materiality,
perhaps
the
most
prominent
being
the
perjury
statutes,
18
u.s.c.
1621,
and
18
u.s.c.
1623,
both
of
which
explicitly
require
proof
that
the
false
statement
be
material
to
the
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
jury
instruction
given
here,
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
42
and
43
of
the
joint
appendix,
informed
the
jury
not
that
the
court
had
found
the
statements
to
be
material,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that.
what
the
court
said
was
the
materiality
of
the
statement
or
representation
alleged
to
be
false
or
concealed
is
not
a
matter
with
which
you
are
concerned,
and
should
not
be
considered
by
you
in
determining
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
that's
on
page
43
of
the
joint
appendix.
now,
the
court
had
also
earlier
enumerated
the
elements
of
section
1014
to
include
materiality.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
on
the
prior
page
of
the
joint
appendix,
page
42.
but
that
was
a
correct
statement
of
circuit
law
at
the
time.
the
eighth
circuit,
like
the
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
had
implied
an
element
of
materiality
into
the
statute,
and
the
government
in
this
case,
if
it
wished
to
obtain
a
conviction
that
it
could
affirm
on
appeal,
complied
with
circuit
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
defendant...
the
defendant
did
object.
the
defendant
argued
that
materiality
should
be
decided
by
the
jury
in
the
trial
court.
the
defendant
was
convicted.
both
defendants
were
convicted.
on
appeal--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
i
wouldn't
describe
the
government's
position
as
satisfied.
i
would
describe
the
government's
position
as
attempting
to
obtain
a
conviction
in
compliance
with
eighth
circuit
law.
if
we
had
gone
to
the
grand
jury
and
said,
charge
this
violation
without
finding
materiality,
and
had
then
gone
to
the
trial
judge
and
said,
don't
make
any
finding
about
materiality,
let's
just
let
this
case
go,
the
judge
would
have
poured
the
case
out.
he
would
have
granted
a
judgment
of
acquittal
against
us,
because
we
had
not
established
what
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
question
is
preserved
because
when
the
case
was
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
eighth
circuit
received
briefs
from
both
parties
before
united
states
v.
gaudin
was
decided
and
heard
oral
argument.
at
that
point,
respondents
didn't
argue
that
materiality
should
have
gone
to
the
jury,
as
they
do
now.
the
government
didn't
argue
that
materiality
is
not
an
element
of
1014,
as
we
do
now.
both
parties
simply
addressed
the
question
of
whether
these
false
statements
were
material.
then
the
united
states
v.
gaudin
was
decided,
and
the
eighth
circuit
asked
the
parties
for
supplemental
briefs
on
the
impact
of
that
decision.
at
that
point,
respondents
said,
there's
been
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case
because
the
jury
did
not
decide
materiality.
the
government
responded,
there
has
not
been
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case
because
section
1014
does
not
require
proof
of
materiality.
the
eighth
circuit,
which
could
have
applied,
i
suppose,
some
version
or
another
of
procedural
default
against
either
or
both
parties,
decided
not
to
apply
any
version
of
procedural
default
to
either
party--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--exactly,
decided
on
the
merits
that
section
1014
requires
proof
of
materiality
in
a
binding
circuitwide
decision
which
we
are
challenging
in
this
court.
we
are
challenging
the
legal
ruling
that
was
ultimately
rendered
by
the
eighth
circuit,
finding
materiality
to
be
an
element.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
the
jury
found
that
element.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia,
we...
i
certainly
agree
that
the
instruction
is
not
correct
as
we
understand
section
1014
to
be
read.
the
question
is
then
whether
the
particular
error
of
the
judge
instructing
the
jury
that
it
should
not
be
concerned
with
materiality
is
sufficiently
harmful
as
to
warrant
overturning
this
conviction.
this
case
is
actually,
i
think,
a...
proof
that
the
purpose-to-influence
element
can
readily
be
established
without
inferring
that
from
proof
of
actual
materiality
of
the
statement.
here's
how
the
purpose-to-influence
element
is
established
in
this
case.
these
respondents
were
engaged
in
a...
the
business
of
leasing
copiers,
with
an
integral
agreement
that
they
would
service
the
copiers.
they
had
an
arrangement
with
one
bank
where
the
bank
knew
about
that
integrated
agreement
and
said,
you...
we
will
buy
these
agreements
from
you,
cash
them
out
for
you,
but
we
will
require
you
to
set
up
a
reserve
account
to
protect
the
service
part
of
your
contract.
the
respondents
needed
more
money.
they
went
to
another
bank
who
also
knew
about
the
integrated
agreement
and
it
said,
we
want
the
same
reserve
account.
at
that
point,
respondents
said,
that's
not
going
to
give
us
enough
money,
we
don't
want
the
reserve
account,
so
they
entered
into
this
conspiracy
to
break
this
integral
agreement
into
two
separate
pieces
of
paper
and
presented
to
the
banks
that
are
the
victim
banks
in
this
case,
only
the
lease,
not
the
service.
and
i
think
that
from
that
sequence
of
events
alone,
a
jury
was
virtually
compelled
to
infer
that
the
false
statements
about
this
nature
of
a
contract
were
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
banks,
but
if
that
wasn't
enough
and
compelling
in
itself,
one
of
the
coconspirators
was
a
cooperator
with
the
government
and
testified
explicitly
that's
why
we
all
did
it.
that's
what
we
agreed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
jury
could
speculate
that
way,
but
the
instruction
doesn't
say
that.
it
simply
says,
don't
concern
yourself
with
it,
and
if
the
jury
is
following
the
instructions
given,
it
won't
concern
itself
with
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
materiality
were
an
element
of
the
crime--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
then
it's
a
conventional
harmless
error
question
which
i
think
is
rather
factually
confined
to
the
record
in
this
case.
the
question
would
be,
would
that
erroneous
inference
from
the
instruction,
or
if
the
instruction
were
explicit,
which
it
is
not,
was
the
explicit
instruction
that
the
statements
were
material
have
tainted
the
verdict
in
this
case,
i
think
that,
given
that
our
position
is
materiality
is
not
an
element,
and
that
there
was
ample
direct
evidence,
coconspirator
admission
and
sequence
of
events
evidence
that
established
that
the
purpose
to
influence
element
was
shown,
that
the
jury
would
not
have
needed
to
and
would
not
have
relied
on
any
inference
it
drew
from
the
materiality
instructions
in
this
case.
but
again--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
certainly
not
in
the
jury
instructions
themselves,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
supplemental
instructions
that
were
given
before
the
time
of
verdict,
so
i
think
that
there
should
not
be
an
inference
that
the
jury
chose
to
speculate
beyond
what
the
instructions
actually
said
and
conclude
that
the
judge
made
some
finding
that
he
should
not,
and
then
use
that
finding
contrary
to
the
instructions
to
infer
the
existence
of
a
different
element--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--certainly.
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
not
a
question
that
has
long
run
factual
significance,
or
long-run
legal
significance,
except
for
this
case.
i
simply
think
that
the
judgment
in
this
case
could
be
affirmed,
the
convictions
could
be
affirmed
based
on
the
instructions
that
were
given.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
is
some
lower
court
authority
to
that
effect,
that
an
instruction
can
become
the
law
of
the
case,
and
i
think
the
issue
here
would
have
been
for
the
eighth
circuit,
if
it
had
chosen...
it
certainly
wasn't
required
to...
might
have
said
the
government
in
this
case
charged
materiality
and
requested--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--materiality
instruction.
it
should
live
with
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
do
that,
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
eighth
circuit
was
required
to
do
that.
in
fact,
i
think
the
better
course--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
should
consider
that
at
all.
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--because
at
most
it
would
be
a
question
of
discretion
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
decide
whether
it
should
conclude
that
the
government's
posture
in
the
district
court
precluded
it
from
making
the
argument
that
it
made
on
appeal,
and
i
think
that
quite
properly
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
said
before
we
find
a
constitutional
violation
based
on
the
failure
to
have
the
jury
decide
materiality,
we
should
at
least
be
satisfied
that
the
statute
requires
that
to
be
proved,
and
it
does
not...
none
of
the
cases
that
respondent
cited
in
this
area
of
instructions
becoming
law
of
the
case
involved
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
has
crossed
that
bridge
already,
and
has
said
that
it
is
going
to
look
at,
on
the
merits,
whether
section
1014
requires
proof
of
materiality.
it
opened
up
to
both
parties
the
opportunity
to
litigate
the
issue
raised
by
united
states
v.
gaudin.
remember,
respondents
did
not,
in
their
briefs,
their
opening
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals,
argue
that
there
was
gaudin
error
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
did
not
decide
materiality.
they
raised
that
issue
only...
they
raised
it
in
the
trial
court,
but
they
did
not
preserve
it
on
appeal.
they
raised
it
only
after
united
states
v.
gaudin
came
down,
and
they
make
that
clear
in
their
own
letter
to
the
court,
which
is
at
page
76
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
they
said
initially,
because
of
existing
law
in
the
circuit,
the
issue
was
not
briefed.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
i
think
chose
quite
properly
to
address
on
the
merits
both
parties'
contentions,
and
that
should
not...
that
is
the
law
of
the
case
at
this
point,
not
the
separate
question
of
whether
the
jury
instruction--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--my
answer
to
that
is
no,
justice
stevens,
but
i
need
to
explain
what
i
think
are
the
kinds
of
omissions
that
are
covered
by
this
statute,
because
this
statute
in
its
terms
prohibits
false
statements
or
false
reports.
it
does
not
in
its
terms
prohibit
concealment
or
omissions
per
se.
the
conventional
kind
of
application
of
this
statute
to...
in
omissions
cases
where
somebody
comes
into
a
bank
and
is
asked
to
list
their
assets
and
liabilities,
and
they
list
their
liabilities
and
they
leave
out
a
few
big
ones.
that
is
occasionally
described
by
the
courts
as
an
omission
of
material
information,
or
an
omission
of
information.
i
think
that
under
this
statute,
that's
properly
construed
as
a
false
statement.
the
application
itself
will
generally
say,
i
have
provided
complete
and
accurate
information
to
you
in
requesting
this
loan.
in
fact,
the
list
is
incomplete,
so
therefore
it's
not
accurate.
that
can
be
called
an
omission,
but
i
think
it's
properly
viewed
as
a
false
statement.
a
second
kind
of
omission
could
occur
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
a
party
has
one
integrated
agreement.
i
lease
you
the
copier,
i
service
it,
but
artificially
divides
the
agreement
into
two
parts,
gives
the
bank
the
lease
agreement,
withholds
the
service
agreement.
that
i
think
also
could
be
colloquially
described
as
an
omission
or
a
concealment,
but
it
really
also
is
a
false
statement.
the
contracts
in
these
cases
that
the
respondents
drafted
said,
this
is
the
entire
agreement
between
the
parties,
the
lessee
has
responsibility
for
service,
in
fact
the
lessee
did
not
have
responsibility
for
service,
and
it
wasn't
the
complete
agreement
between
the
parties,
so
in
those
kinds
of
cases
i
think
we're
really
talking
about
false
statements.
now,
a
third
kind
of
omissions
case,
i
suppose,
could
be
purely
the
omission
of
information
that
might
be
of
interest
to
a
bank,
such
as,
i
go
in
and
i
apply
for
a
mortgage,
and
i
don't
tell
the
bank
that
i've
previously
been
declared
bankrupt
twice.
that's
not
covered
by
this
statute.
now,
another
kind
of
statute
might
want
to
try
to
cover
that,
and
there
are
statutes
that
expressly
cover
concealing
or
covering
up
material
facts,
and
those
statutes
would
apply
perhaps
to
such
a
scheme,
depending
on
whether
the
government
had
proven
all
it
needs
to
prove
in
a
concealment
case,
but
that's
not
a
violation
of
section
1014.
now,
in
this
case
i
think
the
parties
in
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
words
concealment
when
they
really
meant
false
statement,
and
the
district
court's
opinion
rejecting
the
respondent's
rule
29
motion
in
this
case,
which
is
contained
in
the
record,
although
not
in
the
materials
that
this
court
has
available
to
it
in
the
briefs,
very
clearly
said
that
the
contracts
the
respondents
claim
are
literally
true,
and
the
court
said
the
contracts
without
the
addenda
are
not,
in
fact,
literally
true,
they
are
false
statements
and
affirmative
misrepresentations
in
the
lease
as
submitted
to
the
banks.
so
this
case
does
not,
i
believe,
contain
a
true
example
of
what
might
be
described
as
an
omission.
now,
the
trial
court
did,
as
your
honor
points
out,
instruct
that
it
has
to
be
a
concealment
of
a
material
fact.
in
our
view,
the
correct
understanding
of
the
statute
is
first
doesn't
apply
to
naked
omissions,
and
second,
to
the
extent
that
it
does
apply
to
omissions
as
i've
described,
they
don't
have
to
be
material.
what
needs
to
be
shown
is
that
the
individual
engaged
in
those
particular
false
statements
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
bank.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
first,
justice
ginsburg,
there
should
be
no
reference
to
materiality
at
all.
second,
the
requirement
that
the
statement
or
representation
be
false
when
it
is
untrue
when
made,
i
think
at
that
point
if
the
court
amplifies
on
it
at
all
it
should
be
done
to
respond
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
case,
and
should
explain
that
the
statement
must
be
false
or
must
be
misleading
because
of
omitted
information.
and
then
perhaps
in
a
case
such
as
i've
described
where
the
list
of
liabilities
is
incomplete,
the
court
might
explain
at
that
point
that's
what's
meant
by
the
false
statement
in
this
case,
but
there
isn't
any
requirement
of
materiality.
what
the
court
and
the
jury
needs
to
focus
on
is
that
the
statement
needs
to
be
shown
subjectively
by
the
defendant
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
financial
institution.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
rejecting
the
textual--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
that's
correct,
since
materiality
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
the
court
of
appeals'
concern
seemed
to
be
that
without
materiality
this
statute
would
become
a
vehicle
for
prosecuting
trivial
false
statements,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
argument
is
contained
in
the
statute,
itself,
which
has
the
requirement
that
the
government
show
a
purpose
to
influence
the
institution
in
a
financial
transaction.
it's
the
defendant's
own
purpose
that
serves
to
ensure
that
the
statute
is
not
going
to
be
applied
in
a
trivial
context,
it's
going
to
be
applied
when
the
defendant
subjectively
believes
that
he
is
indeed
knowingly
telling
a
false
statement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that's
certainly
true
also,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
question
that
congress
has
the
power,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
to
draft
a
broad
prophylactic
statute
that
accomplishes
two
main
purposes
without
a
materiality
requirement.
it's
a
broad
deterrent
to
anyone
who
wants
to
influence
banks
through
knowing
false
statements--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
some
of
them
do.
the
statutes
are
not
uniform
in
that
construction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
the
legislature
has
complete
control
over
how
it
arranges
these
particular
elements
of
the
offense
and
the
language
of
the
statute
is
the
best
guide
to
what
it
has
selected.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
typically
they're
longer,
justice
stevens,
and
the
government
has
a
pending
cross-appeal
of
the
sentence
in
this
case.
the
sentence
is
so
low
because
the
district
judge
said,
i'm
going
to
find...
and
i
quote...
somewhat
arbitrarily
that
the
loss
in
this
case
was
only
$40,000.
in
fact,
the
probation
department
had
found
that
the
loss
was
over
$1
million,
and
the
government's
pending
cross-appeal
argues
that
the
sentence
imposed
under
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
is
too
low,
and
that
the
actual
correct
sentence
would
require
a
term
of
imprisonment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
believe
it's
between
26
and
31
months,
but
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
the
range
is.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
the
government
waives
rebuttal.
