mr.
joel
t.
remland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
challenges
a
1992
florida
state
law
which
retroactively
redefined
punishment
prescribed
for
a
1985
offense,
in
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
petitioner
committed
his
offense
in
1985.
he
pled
nolo
contendere
and
was
sentenced
in
1986
in
accordance
with
the
sentencing
formula
prescribed
by
florida
law.
the
punishment
formula
in
effect
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
offense
and
at
the
time
of
his
sentencing
provided
that
a
prisoner's
actual
term
of
incarceration
was
equal
to
the
guidelines
sentence
imposed
by
the
judge
less
all
gain
time
awarded.
the
state
granted
petitioner
overcrowding
gain
time
credits
from
1987
in
the
form
of
administrative
gain
time
through
1991
in
the
form
of
provisional
release
credits.
due
to
the
award
of
those
credits,
and
pursuant
to
statutory
law,
the
state
established
a
release
date
for
october
1
of
1992.
as
petitioner's
mandatory
non--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--yes,
sir,
justice
souter.
it
was
calculated
under
one
of
the
successor
statutes
in
1988,
the--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--it's
hard
to
say,
because
the
actual
statute
in
effect
in
1985,
which
was
944-598,
had
not
been
triggered
at
that
point,
and
the
credits
did
not
start
to
issue
until
a
successor
statute
administrative
gain
time
supplanting
provisional...
supplanting
the
emergency
gain
time
statute
kicked
in--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--and
the
actual
credits
could
be
used,
i
believe,
according
to
the
statutes
in
effect
when
the
credits
were
granted,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--i
believe
the
number
would
have
been
the
same,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
1985
the...
mr.
lynce
was
offense-eligible.
the
petitioner
was
offense-eligible,
and
the
percentage
for
the
threshold
was
98
percent.
the
two
key
criteria
was
the
same.
the
formula
in
1983
all
the
way
through,
until
1992,
when
the
second,
harsher,
more
oppressive
formula
was
enacted,
that
changed
the
situation.
but
the
basic
formula
was
the
same
from
1983
through
1985.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
that
is
correct.
it
was
not...
it
was
never
raised
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
first
time
they--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--justice
scalia,
you
did,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
in
1985,
when
the
offense
was
committed,
the
offense
formula
was
basically
the
same
as
it
was
in
'83
earlier
under
the
statute.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
i
think
that
the
actual
issue
was
presented
squarely
under
the
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
offense
under
the
emergency
gain
time
statute
which
mr.
lynce
was
eligible
for
under
98
percent
of
population
cap,
and
he
was
offense-eligible
according
to
law.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
that
statute,
although
it
wasn't
triggered
in
1986,
the
cap
was
reached
and
the
governor
declared
a
special
emergency.
we
went
into
special
session,
and
the
percentage
was
raised
to
98
percent.
it
would
have
been
triggered.
these--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--it's
our
position
that
the
statute
that
was
in
effect
in
1985
was
essentially
the
same
statute
that
was
in
effect
in
1988
when
the
credits
were
being
granted,
and
moreover
there's
no
question
that
the
effect
of
the
change
substantially
increased
the
petitioner's
punishment,
and
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
law,
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
it's
clear
that
we've
got
a
substantial
increase
in
punishment
over
that
that
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
and
the
statutory
formula
in
1985
was
established.
the
petitioner
was
clearly
eligible
for
credits.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
justice
ginsburg,
the
formula
was
adopted
in
1983
under
the
sentencing
reform
act,
and
that
formula
was
the
sentence
of
the
court
minus
the
gain
time
equals
the
actual
sentence.
in
this
particular
matter,
florida
statute
921
authorized
any
and
all
gain
time
to
be
deducted
from
the
actual
sentence
imposed,
and
in
1985
and
1986
there
was
an
overcrowding
problem,
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
that
overcrowding
problem
continued.
the
contention
or
speculative
nature
of
these
credits
doesn't
really
impact
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
the
'92
act
totally
and
retroactively
increased
the
measure
of
punishment.
it
stiffened
the
measure
of
punishment.
it
increased
the
measure
of
punishment
over
the
statutory
formula
under
921,
the
sentencing
guidelines
law
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
offense
that
provided
a
provisional
and
mandatory
release
date.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
justice
souter,
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
for
ex
post
facto
purposes
should
be
the
effect
of
the
'92
law.
not
so
much
emphasis
should
be
placed
on
the
speculative
nature
of
whether
or
not
the
trigger
is
going
to
be
reached.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
justice
souter,
the
statutes
in
this
case
that
provided
the
overcrowding
gain
time
had
no
provisions
which
allowed
revocation
or
forfeiture.
these
credits,
once
granted,
were--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--yes.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes.
i
think
that
the
statute
921,
and
its
subsequent
statutes,
provide
what's
been
referred
to
repeatedly
as
the
nondiscretionary,
irrevocable
release
date.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
the
irrevocable
language--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--not
immediately
in
front
of
me,
but
we've--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--lodged
the
documents
with
the
court
in
the
lodged
documents,
but
it's
under
921.001
and
it
specifically
near
the
end
of
that
statute,
paragraph
10,
and
in
paragraph
8,
the
language
is
specifically
that
your
sentence
is
specifically
determined
by
the
amount
of
time
the
court
imposes
minus
any
and
all
gain
time,
and
that
is
your
release
date.
in
that
release
date
the
word
shall
is
used,
and
in
1988
when
they
adopted
the
provision
of
release
date
statutes,
they
clarified
that.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
sir,
because
the
release
date
uses
the
word
shall.
once
you've
got
the
release
credits
granted
to
you,
there
is
nothing
under
florida
law
that
allows
the
state
to
revoke
those
credits.
that's
why
there's
a
provisional
release
dates,
and
that's
why--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--yes--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--the
provisional
release
date
is
a
mandatory,
statutory--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--because--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--the
word
provisional
is
used...
before
they
used
the
word
provisional,
justice
scalia,
they
used...
they
used
release
date,
they
used...
there's
several
different
words
that
they've
used,
but
in
each
case
the
language
of
the
statute
is
crystal
clear,
and
it
says
that
a
person
shall
be
released
on
that
date.
the
reason
they
use
the
name
provisional
is
because
they
adopted
a
successor
statute
to
emergency
gain
time
in
1988
called
provisional
release
credits.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
justice
o'connor--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--i
would
believe
that
there
would
be
an
ex
post
facto
problem
if
you,
by
the
grace
of
the
legislature
as
stated
in
weaver,
confer
benefits,
for
example,
then
take
them
away,
and
resulting
in
a
huge
increase--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--as
in
this
case
as
well.
we're
not
contending
here
or
submitting
that
the
hypothetical,
justice
o'connor,
that
you
posed
is
necessary
for
relief
in
this
case.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
it
would
appear
that
the
cases
dealing
with
ex
post
facto
doctrine
have
dealt
primarily
with
two
points,
whether
or
not
the
law
is
retrospective
and,
number
2,
whether
it
results
in
a
significant
or
substantial
increase
in
the
measure
of
punishment
and
if,
in
fact,
after
the
sentencing,
a
new
version
of
the
statute--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--a
new
benefit,
justice
o'connor,
as
you
indicate,
was
conferred,
and
that
benefit--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
but
like
in
this
case
there's
also
a
good
conduct
provision
as
well.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
it--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--it's
not--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--in
this
particular
case
the
defendant
lost
5
years,
and
had
5
years
added
to
his
sentence.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
i
think
he
would
lose
the
possibility
of
a
sentence
reduction
based
upon
the
new
provision.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
it's
not
clear
from
looking
at
supreme
court
cases
in
the
past
whether
or
not
that--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--our
position,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
formula
in
1985
was
in
place,
and
that
provided
him
with
a
statutory
formula
for
ex
post
facto
analysis
against
the
harsher,
more
onerous
formula
that
was
enacted
in
1992
by
retroactive
application
through
the
attorney
general's
rein--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
i
think
the
eligibility
for
future
credits
as
emphasized
in
the
weaver
case
and
also
the
nature
of
the
increase
in...
in
miller,
for
example,
in
miller
v.
florida,
where
a
new
guideline
amendment,
a
new
formula,
if
you
will,
was
used
to
make
a
harsher
punishment--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
absolutely.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
absolutely.
they
were
both
98
percents,
and
they
were
both...
he
was
offense-eligible
in
1985,
and
it
was
at
98
percent.
he
was
offense-eligible
in
1992,
until
they
retroactively
excluded
him
for
eligibility
and
canceled
all
the
credits
and
also
future
eligibility.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
i--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--i
do
not
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
an
individual
who's
committing
a
crime
on
the
outside
is
thinking
in
terms
of
what
specific
gain
time
statutes
might
exist,
and
i
don't
think
that
kind
of
a
reliance
interest
is
required
for
a
claim
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
however,
i
do
think
that
reliance
is
one
of
the
interest
as
well
as
expectations
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
addresses.
however,
i
think
in
this
case
in
1985,
when
the
offense
was
committed,
through
1986,
there
was
real
overcrowding,
there
was
an
overcrowding
formula,
justice
stevens,
as
you
pointed
out,
in
1985
that
made
him
98
percent...
the
population
cap
was
there
at
98
percent,
and
the
overcrowding
was
there,
and
there
were
newspaper
articles
coming
out.
and
the
governor
in
1986,
one
month
prior
to
the
time
of
the
plea
in
this
case,
went
into
special
session
and
raised
the
trigger
from
98
percent
to
99
percent,
so
there's
maybe
an
objective
reliance
here
on
the
part
of
any
petitioner
in
this
particular
situation,
especially
when
we
have
in
place
since
1985
and
earlier
a
statutory
formula
under--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--as
long
as
the
statute
didn't
cancel
credits
already
awarded
in
the
past,
i
think--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--i
don't...
florida's
done
that,
judge...
judge
ginsburg
in
the
controlled
release
statute
which
was
passed
in
1989
and
got
up
and
running
in
1991.
that
statute
has
within
its
parameters
a
method
of
reducing
and
changing
the
release
date
based
upon
changes
in
population.
the
statute
is
being...
if
the
statute
is
applied
in
a
prospective
manner,
not
retroactively,
creating
a
harsher
punishment,
i
don't
see
a
constitutional
problem
with
addressing
overcrowding
through
the
prospective
application
of
law.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
sir.
0....
you
say
page
10?
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
absolutely,
justice
souter.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
justice
souter,
that
the
meaning
and
the
use
of
the
statutes
in
this
case
refer
to
gain
time
and...
in
all
its
different
forms,
such
as--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--the
use
of
these
statutes
in
florida
since
1983
and
the
analysis
of
the
way
they've
been
operating
is
that
the
gain
time
accumulates
unless
there's
a
discipline
problem,
and--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--yes,
sir.
the--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--absolutely.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
there's
no
provision
for--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
he
was
released
by
the
department
of
corrections
on
october
1
of
1992
and
told
to
go
home,
you're
released
on
your
provisional
release
date,
which
is
mandatory
under
the
law.
the
1988
version
of
this
statute,
which
i
believe
is
subparagraph
10,
justice
souter,
says
that
you
shall
be
released
on
your
provisional
release
date,
and
that's
on
page
12.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
and
i
think--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--absolutely,
and--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--and
even
the
florida
supreme
court
cases
have
looked
at
all
these
different
gain
times
and
said
they're
basically
the
same.
in
griffin
v.
singletary
for
example,
the
florida
supreme
court
stated
that
the
provisional
release
credit
statute
is
the
same
as
the
administrative
gain
time
statute,
and
in
dugger
v.
rodrick
the
florida
supreme
court
lumped
all
of
these
population
control
statutes
together
and
said
they're
called
population
control
statutes.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
the
florida
supreme
court
has
carved
out
sort
of
an
exception
and
tried
to
distinguish
between
good
behavior
incentive
gain
time
on
the
one
hand
and
overcrowding
gain
time
on
the
other.
i
believe--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--absolutely,
justice
stevens.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
credits,
justice
stevens,
are
nothing
more
than
good
time
credits
during
periods
of
overcrowding,
and
as
arnold
v.
cody
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
noted,
the
contingent
nature
of
the
credits
emanating
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act
really
just
shows
you
the
credits
are
being
awarded.
it's
an
issue
of
retroactivity.
in
this
particular
matter,
the
real
key
issue
is
whether
the
effect
of
the
law,
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
as
in
moralis
v.
department
of
california
department
of
corrections
was
that
did
this
changed
formula
in
1992
substantially
stiffen
the
measure
of
punishment?
did
it
increase?
did
it
make
it
more
onerous
than
the
formula
that
mr.
lynce,
the
petitioner
herein,
was
eligible
for,
98
percent
in
1985,
and
not
excluded
because
of
his
offense?
mr.
joel
t.
remland
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
florida,
because
of
the
overcrowding
crisis,
should
be
able
to
address
this
crisis
in
any
manner
it
feels
reasonable
with
prospective
laws.
if
they
deny
mr.
lynce
or
anybody
else
eligibility
because
of
a
prior
crime
that
he
committed,
then
it
delves
into
the
area
of
violating--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--if
they
enact
any
formula
that
makes
it
more
harsh
or
more
onerous
to
someone
who's
already
had
another
formula
under
an
earlier--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
i
guess
it
wouldn't
be
any
difference
unless
it
impacted
him
adversely
from
the
prior
formula.
i
think
you
have
to
just
look
at
both
formulas.
if
it
doesn't
adversely
affect
the
overall
sentence
in
terms
of
the
duration
of
his
actual
term
of
incarceration,
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
ex
post
facto.
the
only
test
is
whether
or
not
the
new
formula
is
harsher
or
more
oppressive
than
the
earlier
formula,
sort
of
like--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
policy
you're
discussing
would
seem
to
be
rather
discretionary,
and
perhaps
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
having
the
effect
of
law,
or
the--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
an
administrative
regulation
that
doesn't
have
a
tightened
control
or
mandatory
nature
to
it
would
be
the
same
as
the
statute
that
we
have
in
this
case
that
guarantees
a
certain
formula
for
sentencing.
mr.
joel
t.
remland
i
think
it's
the
effect.
of
course,
if
the
effect
has
a
substantial
impact
and
that
effect--
mr.
joel
t.
remland
--it
appears
to
pose
an
ex
post
facto
issue
and
a
problem
if
there
is
in
effect
increasing
punishment.
