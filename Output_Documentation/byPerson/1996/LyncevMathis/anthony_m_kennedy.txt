justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
you
had
this
system
and
the
state
then
passed
a
new
statute
which
had
a
90-percent
trigger
point,
but
it...
and
it
provided
for
immediate
release
to
keep
it
at
90
percent,
and
it
excluded
people
that
were
convicted
of
murder
or
attempted
murder,
would
that...
and
the
effect
of
that
was
to
keep
your
client
in
jail.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
no,
they
have
a
new
cap
at
90
percent.
they
just
exclude
certain
offenders,
including
your
client.
hence,
because
of
the
90-percent
cap,
they
release
people,
and
he'll
never
reach
the
98,
so
in
effect
they've
taken
away
from
him
his
credit.
would
that
be
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
don't
make
it
more
harsh.
they
just
provide
something
for
somebody
else.
what's
the
difference
in
that
and
building
a
new
prison?
i
take
it
that
there'd
be
no
violation
if
they
build
a
huge
new
prison
and
they
never
reach
the
98
percent
cap.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
the
difference
in
that
and
my
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
new
formula
that
i
stipulated
is
more
lenient
to
everybody
but
its...
doesn't
apply
to
him,
so
that
it
makes
inoperable
his.
well,
i
guess
you've
answered
the
question.
does
this
formula
have
to
be
in
the
statute?
suppose
the
prison
system
just
has
a
policy
that
when
there's...
or
they're
under
injunction
from
a
federal
court
that
they
can't
have
so
many...
more
than
so
many
people
in
their
institutions,
and
they
institute
a
policy
that
when
we
have
so
many
we
will
let
out
first
of
all
the
pickpockets,
and
let's
assume
your
client's
a
pickpocket.
now,
would
that
policy
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
for
pickpocketing,
would
that
have
to
be
continued,
or
else
the
ex
post
facto
prohibition
of
the
constitution
violated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
might
understand
your
argument
better
if
it
applied
across
the
board,
but
it
as
i
understand
it
the
statute
took
away
the
provisional
gain
time
from
a
class
of
offenders,
dangerous
people,
including
an
attempted
murderer,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
to
square
that
with
your
assertion
that
this
was
not
to
punish.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
rationale
in
that
case
was
that
it
was
unlikely
that
there
would
be
really
any
difference.
here,
it
is
clear
there
was
a
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
isn't
that
a
judgment
that
one
crime
is
more
culpable
or
more
dangerous
than
another,
and
therefore
more
deserving
of
incarceration?
that
sounds
like
punishment
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
deterrence
is
one
of
the
central
rationales
for
punishment,
and
you're
saying
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that
you're
saying
that
deterrence
or
prevention,
i
suppose,
is
the
rationale
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
what
was
the
universe
for
measuring
overcrowding?
was
it
the
entire
florida
correction
systems,
or
was
it
prison
by
prison?
