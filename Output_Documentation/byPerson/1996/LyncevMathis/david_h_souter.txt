justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
remland,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
can
you
tell
me
whether
the
figure
that
the
state
arrived
at
in
determining
what
the
release
date
was
was
calculated
under
the
statute
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
the
'83
statute
which
is
set
out
on
page
27
of
the
lodging,
or
whether
that
figure
was
calculated
under
one
of
the
later
statutes?
i...
in
candor,
i
had
assumed
that
it
was
calculated
under
one
of
the
successor
statutes,
but
i
want
to
make
sure
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
if
we
to...
i'm
sorry.
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause
the
only
statute
that
should
be
considered
was
the
one
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
i
take
it
the
figure
that
they
calculated
and
the
date
which
they
arrived
at
would
have
been
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
that
may
not
support
an
ex
post
facto
argument.
that
might
support...
just
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
here
that
that
might
just
support
a
due
process
claim,
which
is
not
what
we
have
before
us,
and
i
take
it
the
only
thing
we
can
say
for
sure
is
that
if
the
calculation
were
made
under
the
statute
as
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
we
don't
know
that
the
number
arrived
at
would
have
been
the
same
number
that
was
awarded
under
the
later
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
may...
on
that
point,
may
i
ask
you
a
variant
of
justice
ginsburg's
question?
i've
gone
over
the
statute
as
you've
provided
it
to
us
in
the
lodging,
the
statute
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
and
it's
not
clear
to
me
from
reading
that
statute
whether
any
reduction
that
did
not
result
in
the
release
of
a
particular
prisoner
would
have
survived
the
termination
of
the
emergency.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
from
the
statute,
for
example,
that
if
your
client
got
a
30-day
reduction
at
some
point
because
there
was
an
emergency
during
his
incarceration,
but
he
was
not
released
as
a
result
of
it
because
the
reduction
didn't
get
him
down
to
that
point,
it's
not
clear
to
me
from
the
statute
that
the
reduction
would
have
sort
of
remained
on
the
books,
if
you
will,
as
a
permanent
reduction
in
his
sentence
once
the
population
had
dropped
down
and
that
emergency
was
passed.
and
i
guess
my
question
is,
isn't
that
another
reason
for
saying
that
under
the
statute
as
it
existed
when
he
committed
his
offense
it
is
at
best
speculative
whether
he
would
have
obtained
the
kind
of
long-term
permanent
reduction
benefit
that
you
are
claiming
he
has
been
denied
improperly
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
that
the
effect
of
the
'92
law
depends
on
what
he
might
have
been
entitled
to
under
the
law
that
was
changed
and
if,
in
fact,
under
the
law
that
was
changed,
under
the
'83
act
if
that's
what
we're
going
to
consider,
it
is
not
even
clear
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
retain
his
credit
beyond
the
termination
of
the
emergency
during
which
it
was
granted,
then
i
can't
say
that
the
later
statute
took
away
anything.
at
best
i
would
say,
well,
it's
speculative
as
to
whether
it
took
away
anything.
there's
no
case
law
telling
me
how
to
read
this
in
your
client's
favor,
and
that's
the
difficulty
i
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
my
difficulty
is,
they
don't
have
any
provision
that
clearly
says
that
the
gain
time
under
the
emergency
statutes
survives
the
emergency.
i
just
don't
know.
is
there
something
in
the
text--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
you
could
point
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
says,
this
becomes
permanently
vested?
justice
david
h.
souter
where's
the
irrevocable
language
in
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
have
you
got
it
in
front
of
you?
do
you
have
the
statute
in
front
of
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
remland,
may
i
interrupt
you,
because
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
getting
back
to
a
point
that
i
think
we're
all
concerned
with
here.
i
thought
i
had
gotten
into
the
question
whether
florida
under
the
'83
act
was
awarding
credits
that
would
survive
the
overcrowding
or
were
not
surviving
the
overcrowding,
so
that...
and
your
answer
to
me
was
their
credits
survived
the
emergency.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
emergency
was
over,
you
still
retain
the
credits.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
were
saying
to
me
the
statute
we've
got
is
not
the
kind
of
statute
that
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
you
the
hypothetical
about.
and
you
said
the
reason
for
the
permanence
of
the
credits
was
921.001,
subsections
8
or
10.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i've
got
that
out,
and
it's
on
page
10
of
the
lodging.
do
you
have
a
copy
of
the
lodging
with
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
0....
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
down
in
the...
i
don't
get
a
subsection
10
there,
but
i
get
a
subsection
8,
and
subsection
8
provides
that
a
person
convicted
of
a
crime
after
a
certain
date,
and
so
on,
will
be
released
from
incarceration
only
(a)
upon
expiration
of
the
sentence,
(b)
upon
expiration
of
the
sentence
as
reduced
by
accumulated
gain
time,
or,
and
there's
a
third
alternative.
now,
i
take
it
that
your
answer
to
me
depends
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
uses
the
word
accumulated.
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
to
refer
to
accumulated
gain
time
unless
the
gain
time
survived
the
emergency.
is
that
sort
of
the
nub
of
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
does
the
word...
my
question
is,
and
i
probably
should
know
this
from
reading
the
briefs
but
i'm
not
sure,
does
the
word
gain
time
include
not
only
this
provisional
gain
time
that
is
awarded
in
the
case
of
emergencies,
but
the
other
kinds
of
gain
time
which
reduce
a
sentence
for
good
behavior
and
so
on?
does
the
word
gain
time
include
all
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
isn't
it
the
case
that
we
really
cannot
say
that
the
fact
that
gain
time
is
referred
to
as
accumulated
gain
time,
we
can't
infer
from
that
that
the
emergency
kind
of
gain
time
is
accumulated
as
opposed
to,
let's
say,
the
good
behavior
kind
of
gain
time.
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
some
of
which
may
accumulate
under
the
statute
governing
it,
and
some
of
which
may
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
under
the
emergency
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
you're
saying
administrative
practice,
even
though
there's
no
court
decision
on
it
and
even
though
the
statute
doesn't
expressly
address
it,
the
administrative
practice
is
to
make
it
a
permanent
gain.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
under
the
emergency
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
basically
your
argument
is,
is
an
argument
that
construes
the
statute
in
accordance
with
the
actual
administrative
practice
until
they
got
this
statute
that
hauled
this
poor
man
back,
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
thomson,
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
terms
of
the
'83
statute
would
be
enforceable
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
assume,
secondly,
though
you
correct
me
if
you
think
this
is
wrong,
but
at
least
for
the
moment
assume
that
under
the
statutory
scheme
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
offense
in
'83
one
simply
couldn't
tell
one
way
or
the
other
whether
one
of
these
emergency
credits
would,
in
fact,
survive
the
emergency
if
the
individual
was
not
released.
and
assume,
number
3,
if
you
will,
and
again
correct
me
later
if
you
think
this
is
wrong,
but
assume
for
now,
as
opposing
counsel
said,
that
the
credits
have
in
fact,
even
under
the
emergency
provisions,
the
emergency
credits
have
been
accumulated
and
have
survived
the
emergencies
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice.
that's
what
they've
been
doing.
my
question
is
this.
is
there
anything
in...
was
there
anything
in
florida
law
at
the
time
of
the
offense
in
'83
that
made
it...
that
would
have
provided,
or
did
provide
that
the
administrative
practice
had
to
be
what
in
fact
it
was?
was
there
anything
in
florida
law
at
that
time
that
says
you're
supposed
to
accumulate
rather
than
not
accumulate?
or,
conversely,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
in
'83
what
the
administrators
did
was
a
matter
of
their
grace.
they
could
either
accumulate
or
not
accumulate.
it
was
purely
up
to
them,
and
nobody
could
say
what
they
ought
to
do.
which
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
just
the
emergency
gain
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
just
the
emergency
gain
time.
was
there
any...
any
law,
outside
of
the
confines...
confines
of
what
we
have
in
the
lodging,
that
would
have
indicated
that
the
administrators
were
supposed
to
accumulate
this,
or,
conversely,
were
the
administrators
free
to
do
anything
they
wanted
simply
as
a
matter
of
grace?
they
could
either
accumulate
it
and
retain
it
beyond
the
emergency
or
not,
as
they
saw
fit.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
how
does
this...
i
don't
know
if
you
can
explain
it.
maybe
you
can
just
refer
me
to
a
source,
but
it
does
seem
if
you
could
refer
me
to
a
source
as
to
how
these
statutes
work,
it
would
be
helpful.
as
i
read
598
and
then
277
and
276,
it
seems
to
me
they're
identical
but
for
the
fact
that
the
latter
uses
the
word
60
days
and
may,
and
the
former
uses
the
word
shall
and
30
days
as
far
as
we're
interested
here.
what
it
says
you're
supposed
to
do
is
that,
when
it
hits
98
percent,
then
you
start
reducing
the
prison
population,
and
you
do
it
by
giving
each
person
in
5-day
increments
up
to
30
days'
gain
time.
where
did
we
get
the
number
1,800
from?
it
said
up
to
30
days,
and
what
i...
as
i
read
it
literally
it
sounded
as
if
you
have
1,000
people
in
the
prison,
they're
all
there
under
25
years,
which
means
they're
really
only
10
years,
and
then...
after
you
eliminate
all
the
regular
gain
time
they're
there
for
10
years.
and
then
what
you
do
is,
you
look
through
the
whole
1,000,
you
give
each
of
these
1,000
people
30
days
off
their
sentence,
which
will
do
nothing
for
prisor,
overcrowding
because
they're
not
supposed
to
be
released
for
a
long
time
anyway,
but
they
all
get
lighter
sentences,
and
then
you
come
down
finally
to
it
might
be
one
person
who's
about
to
get
out
tomorrow,
so
he
gets
out.
i
mean,
how
does
this
work?
