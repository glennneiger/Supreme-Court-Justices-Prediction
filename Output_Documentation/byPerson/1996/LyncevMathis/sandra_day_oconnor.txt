justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
didn't
that
depend
on
whether
the
prison
was
overcrowded
to
a
certain
percentage
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
how
it's
calculated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
if
he
were
sentenced
under
an
earlier
statute
that
didn't
provide
the
provisional
release
credits
based
on
prison
overcrowding.
he
was
sentenced
under
another
regime
that
provided
some
gain
time
but
not
this
overcrowding
concept,
and
the
legislature
after
sentencing
then
enacts
a
provisional
release
law
based
on
overcrowding.
after
the
sentencing,
after
the
commission
of
the
crime,
after
sentencing
they
enact
this
thing,
and
then
later
they
amend
it
or
repeal
it.
is
there
some
ex
post
facto
problem
at
that
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
suppose
that
were
what
happened,
how
does
ex
post
facto
doctrine
help
in
that
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
new
benefit
is
enacted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
provisionally,
based
on
the
extent
of
population
of
the
prison.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
in
the
meantime,
before
it
had
ever
been
applied,
the
state
just
built
another
prison,
so
it
never
came
into
operation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
defendant
lose
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
under
the
hypothetical,
please.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
the
defendant
have
lost?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
new
law,
but
how
is
that
ex
post
facto
if
we
look
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
the
sentence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
your
argument
is
that
broad,
you
lose
me.
do
you
have
a
fallback
position
that
it
only
applies
to
those
credits
that
he
would
have
received
under
the
law
in
effect
in
1985?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
remland--
--well,
does
your
argument
depend
at
all
on
the
fact
that
the
state
retroactively
revoked
already
awarded
gain
time
credits?
is
that
your
focus?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
be
here
under
any
other
scenario?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
at
the
time
the
prisoner
was
committing
the
attempted
murder
that
he
took
into
calculation
the
fact
that
there
might
be
prison
overcrowding,
and
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
has
some
ex
post
facto
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
thomson,
assume
that
under
the
law
in
effect
in
1985
the
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
to
certain
gain
time
credits
based
on
good
behavior
and
other
things,
and
he
went
along
earning
those
credits
until
all
of
a
sudden
the
state
passes
a
retroactive
law
that
takes
away
gain
time
credits
already
accumulated
for
him.
can
it
do
that?
is
there
an
ex
post
facto
problem
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
but
you're
losing
me
a
little
bit.
in
this
particular
case,
up
until
1992,
had
the
defendant
accumulated
some
gain
time
credits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
until
1992--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--had
this
defendant
accumulated
some
gain
time
credits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
law
passed
in
1992
made
him
ineligible
for
that
retroactively.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
he
also
had
some
gain
time
based
on
overcrowding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
he
had
some.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
the
state
passes
a
new
law
and
makes
it
retroactive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
that
the
ex
post
facto
doctrine
does
not
apply
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
they
certainly
affected
the
time
the
inmate
would
serve.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
may
be
that's
a
good
argument
for
a
prospective
law
to
that
effect,
but
how
does
that
justify
a
retrospective
law
that
affects
people
who've
already
been
awarded
credits
and
are
out?
