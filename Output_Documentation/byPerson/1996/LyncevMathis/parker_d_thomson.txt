mr.
parker
d.
thomson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
implicated
here
only
if
the
1992
statute
that
terminated
the
application
of
the
provisional
release
credits
for
mr.
lynce
increased
the
quantum
of
punishment
attached
to
his
crime
from
the
date
it
was
committed.
that
is
the
definition
of
an
ex
post
facto
law.
a
statute
must
increase
the
quantum
of
punishment
at
that...
over
that
which
existed
at
that
point
of
time,
or
it
is
simply
not
subject
to
ex
post
facto
attack,
whatever
other
bases
there
may
for
attacking
it.
in
looking
at
the
provisional
release
credits,
or
the
other
forms
of
overcrowding
credits
adopted
by
florida
in
response
to
a
serious
overcrowding
problem,
a
federal
court
decree,
a
settlement
of
that
federal
court
case,
and
then
the
adoption
of
certain
policies
later
encapsulated
into
statute,
all
of
those
procedures
we
submit
were
not
penal.
in
fact,
their
purpose
was
the
opposite
of
penal.
it
was
remedial
and
procedural.
the
1992
act
and
all
the
other
acts
adopted
over
this
period
of
time
were
attempted
solutions
to
that
same
large
problem
that
florida
was
confronting.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
the
weaver
case
tells
us
that
there
is.
the
weaver
case
involved
basic
gain
time.
florida
remodeled
its
basic
gain
time
statute
to
leave
the
credits
where
they
were,
but
to
modify
them
prospectively,
and
this
court
held
that
the
state
of
florida
could
not
do
that.
it
couldn't
modify
them
at
all.
now,
i
interpret
that
aspect
of
gain
time
as
written
in
weaver
in
part
by
the
reference
in
the
moralis
case
in
1995
to
weaver
being
part
of
a
trilogy,
the
trilogy
being
the
lindsey
case
in
1937,
weaver,
and
the
miller
case
in
1987.
those
were...
lindsey
and
miller
were
clearly
sentencing
cases,
and
i
interpret
weaver--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
your--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
made
him...
the
law
passed
in
1992
made
him
ineligible
for
provisional
credits.
he
had
basic
gain
time
accumulated.
he
had
some
incentive
gain
time
accumulated.
the
law
did
not
touch
those.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
he
had
gain
time
based
on
overcrowding
broken
into
two
components,
one
under--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
right.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
correct,
your
honor.
i...
we
say
that
it
does
not
apply
not
only
because
the
statutes
from...
which
were
the...
which
were
take...
in
which
something
was
taken
away
from
him
did
not
exist
at
the
time
that
he
committed
his
crime.
not
only
that,
but
because
those
kinds
of
statutes
involved
here
were
not
penal.
an
ex
post
facto
law
turns
on
penal
statutes.
these
laws
were
not
directed
in
any
way
at
punishing
the
individual
inmate.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
there
are
lots
of
things
that
affect
the
time
that
an
inmate
will
serve
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
of
whether
punishment
is
being
imposed
on
him.
in
this
case,
the
state
was
dealing
with
problems
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
individual
inmates.
they
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
an
inmate.
they
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
rewarding
an
inmate.
they
were
to
deal
with
a
serious
problem
of
overcrowding
which
required
early
release
of
certain...
a
certain
number
of
people
which
the
state
moved
back
and
forth
in
light
of
its
other
obligation,
which
was
to,
as
best
it
could,
protect
the
safety
of
the
streets,
and
therefore
decided
who
it--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--justice
kennedy,
it
was
no
more
to
punish
than
the
moralis
case,
which
applied
a
different
rule
to
a
certain
class
of
prisoners,
in
that
case
double
murderers.
the
overcrowding--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--the
overcrowding
was
not
by
itself.
overcrowding
resulted
in
the
release
of
people,
and
you
can
look
at
the
florida
statutes,
and
they
looked
at
who
it
was
that
was
going
to
be
released,
what
classifications
of
people,
and
they
said,
certain
classes
of
people
should
not
be
released
to
the
streets
to
take
care
of
an
overcrowding
problem.
this
changed
from
time
to
time
as
overcrowding
became
a
greater
or
a
less
problem.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
indirectly
it
has...
it
makes
a
judgment
of
who
are
more
likely
to
cause
a
problem
by
early
release.
there
is
no
change
of
the
sentence
of
anybody,
those
that
are
released
or
those
that
are
not
released.
the
sentence
remains
what
it
was.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
retribution
and
deterrence
are
the
two
classes.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
you're
not
trying
to
prevent
a
crime.
you
are
simply
deciding
if
you
are
going
to
take
care
of
a
problem
called
overcrowding...
i've
got
too
many
people
in
the
prisons
and
i
don't
have
enough
space,
and
i've
got
to
let
a
certain
number
of
them
on
the
streets.
then
i
make
judgments
within
that
determination
of
who
should
and
should
not
be
released
consistent
with
my
obligation
as
a
legislator
to
best
protect
public
safety.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
insofar
as
the
ex
post
facto
clause
goes,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not...
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
not
involved
because
we
are
going
to
go
and
take
a
look
back
at
1985.
there
may
be
other
constitutional
issues.
due
process,
eighth
amendment
problems,
and
certain
other
problems
that
may
exist,
but
it
is
not
an
ex
post
facto
problem,
which
is
the
one
that
is
before
the
court--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--the
1983
statute
is
interesting,
because
in
the
first
place
it
was
entitled
early
release
of
prisoners.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
was
not
classified...
excuse
me?
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
emergency
release
of
prisoners.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
was
not...
when
you
look
at
the
history
of
that
1983
law,
which
is
in
the
lodged
documents,
you
know,
gain
time
provisions,
and
then
the
special
emergency
release
of
prisoners,
it
says
we're
going
to
take
care
of
the
serious
problems
created
under
the
federal
court--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no.
there
was
an
overcrowding
problem
consistently
all
along,
but
clearly
it
never
was
released
under
that...
i
mean,
it
never
was
reached
under
that
statute
because
that
statute
was
never
applied.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
aspect
of
it
was.
the
later
statutes
had
exceptions.
they
were
different
statutes.
the
1992--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--correct.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
they
were
discretionary.
all
the
subsequents
were
first
discretionary,
and
then
they
had
specific
exceptions
of
people
that
they
would
not
reach,
which
changed
from
time
to
time.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
we
do
not
know
whether
he
ever
would
have
qualified
under
the
earlier
statute
because
it
was
never
applied.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
if
in
fact
what
was
done
in
1983
was
cast
in
stone
as
part
of
this
person's
sentence,
which
i
submit
that
it
was
not,
then
it
never
could
have
been
changed
at
any
time.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
if--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--if,
in
fact,
any
time
after
1985,
any
time
there
was
available
a
98-percent--i
mean,
you
reach
98
percent,
it
was
mandatory
to
release
him
and
there
were
no
exceptions
that
would
apply
to
him,
then
you
are
casting
in
stone
the
first
effort
that
florida
made
to
deal
with
an
overcrowding
problem,
and
you
have
said
that
that
was
part
of
his
punishment.
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
early
release
of
prisoners
by
reason
of
overcrowding
was
never
part
of
his
punishment.
it
was
never
part
of
his
sentence.
it
had
no
relationship
to
what
he
did
in
prison.
there
was
no
aspect
of
reward.
it
was
neither
retributative
nor
was
it
deterrent.
it
simply
said
if,
in
fact,
florida
has
a
problem
unrelated
to
you
that
is
not
taken
care
of
in
a
whole
variety
of
ways,
then
this
statute
could--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--exactly.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
he
would
have
been
at
most--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--an
incidental
beneficiary
of
those
statutes.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
would
have
been
true
of
any
overcrowding
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
mr.
justice
souter,
are
you
referring
to
any
aspect
of
gain
time,
or
are
you
referring
only--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--to
overcrowding?
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
in
1983
there
was
nothing.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
with
your
honor's
permission,
it
will
take
a
minute.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
i'll
try
and
give
it
to
you
quickly.
there
were
four
statutes.
the
first,
the
emergency
release
of
prisoners,
has
been
referred
to
in
my
response
to
justice
souter,
and
that
is
the
one
that
had
30
days
in
5-day----
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--and
no
exceptions.
the
next
one
was
called
administrative
gain
time.
that's
276.
it
was
adopted
in
1987.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
the
second
one,
the
one
i've
just
mentioned,
administrative
gain
time,
said
up
to
60
days,
and
so
once
an
emergency
was
declared
by
the
administrator,
referred
to
the
governor,
the
governor
assented,
it
came
back,
and
the
secretary
allocated
days
from
zero
to
60
to
that
particular
instant
and
assigned
them
to
the
block
of
people
that
were
in
the
eligible
pool.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
you
get...
actually,
if
you--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--no.
it
happened
a
slew
of
times,
and
it
happened
sometimes
with
a
lot
less
than
that.
it
happens
incidentally
to
have
been
over
31
months,
and
there
were
60
days,
so
you--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--might
mistakenly
think
that
there
was
a
direct
multiplication,
and
there
isn't.
in
fact,
there
were
a
whole
set
of
certifications
and
determinations
by
the
secretary
over
the
period
of
time
that
the
provisional
credits
were
given,
which
was
from
1988
until
the
beginning
of
1991.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
i
said--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--i
said--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--oh,
no.
his
sentence
never
changed.
his
sentence
was
given
to
him.
it
was
22
years.
if
you
accept
weaver,
it
was
shortened
by
basic
gain
time
at
the
date
of
the
sentence,
because
that's
the
way
basic
gain
time
is
handled.
you
lopped
about
6
or
7
years
off
of
it.
you
then
have
incentive
gain
time,
which
in
fact
the
florida
court
has
construed
weaver
applies
to
and
therefore
could
not
be
taken
away.
those
are
things
that
are
within
his
control
at
least.
he
can
handle
those.
there's
something
he
can
do
about
those.
he
can
work.
he
can
earn
gain
time.
it
cannot
be
taken
away
from
him.
the
overcrowding
credit
in
fact
relates
to
the
releasing
of
prisoners.
in
fact,
it
shouldn't
be
looked
at
until
you
have
to
release
a
prisoner,
and
during
that
period
of
time
you
ought
to
be
able
to
adjust
to
your
needs.
in
fact,
for
administrative
purposes,
because
the
florida
system
is
so
large,
credits
were
booked
with
respect
to
these
individuals
so
that
they
did
have
an
accumulation.
it
was
related
to
these
two
statutes,
administrative--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--yes,
your
honor.
on
page
52
of
the
joint
appendix
there
is
zero...
of
course,
it's
not
named.
there's
zero
under
the
1983
statute,
because
it
was
never,
ever
brought
into
effect
either
before
the
day
he
committed
his
crime
or
thereafter.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
i
was
saying...
i
was
saying,
your
honor,
there
is
a
figure
called
335,
which
is
next
to
administrative
gain
time
awarded.
that
is
administrative
gain
time
that
was
under
the
1-year
statute.
it
was
not
taken
away
from
him
by
the
1992
law,
and
it
is
not
challenged
here,
but
you
should
know
that
in
fact
once
the
overcrowding
issue
was
ameliorated
and
the
costello
decree
was
terminated,
the
legislature
revoked
all
administrative
gain
time
and
provisional
release
credits.
that's
beyond
the
time
of
this
statute.
so
at
the
time
this
was
written,
he
still
had
335
days
on
the
book
for
administrative
gain
time.
it
says
1360.
that
is
a
typographical
error
below
that.
it
means
1,860
as
is
shown
by
the
previous
page
of
the
affidavit.
that
is
the
amount
of
time
that
had
been
booked
for
him
with
respect
to
provisional
credit.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
is,
your
honor,
as
is
the
335.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is
correct,
because
the
alternative
was
that
each
day
you
had
an
overcrowding
problem
you
would
recalculate,
and
that
seemed
to
be,
one
would
say,
a
little
bit
a
waste
of
time,
so
you...
as
long
as
you
had
a
consistent
overcrowding
problem,
once
you
assigned
credits
to
a
person
they
were
just
left
there.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
i
mean
that
they
were
entered
in
his
record,
and
that
continued
until
1989,
the
fourth
effort,
which
is
called
controlled
release
in
florida,
in
which,
starting
as
of
january
of
'91,
these
matters
of
overcrowding
were
assigned
to
the...
a
controlled
release
authority,
which
is
really
the
parole
commission
under
another
name,
and
there
is
no
booking
with
respect
to
those
credits
at
any
time
for
mr.
lynce
because
they
were
handled
differently,
and
that's
the
method
of
dealing
with
overcrowding
that
started
in
1991
and
terminated
finally
in
1994,
when
the
last
overcrowding
release
occurred
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
all
gain
time...
other
than
the
overcrowding
issue,
all
the
gain
time
is
hooked
in
some
fashion
to
prison
management.
there
is
no
doubt
of
that.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
what
is...
what
this
court
has
held
in
the
weaver
case
is
that
basic
gain
time,
which
is
the
one
aspect
of
gain
time
that
is
assigned
to
an
individual
at
the
day
he
enters
the
prison
and
therefore
may
be
deemed
part
of
the
sentence
for
purposes
of
how
judges
approach
it,
how
defense
attorneys
and
prosecutors
approach
it,
that
this
court...
i
can
read
weaver
a
bunch
of
ways,
but
if
i
read
weaver
as
a
sentencing
case,
and
when
this
court
refers
it
to
as
a
trilogy
with
lindsey
and
miller
it
seems
to
me
clearly
it
is,
then
basic
gain
time
as
part
of
that
initial
factor
makes
some
sense
as
being
treated
as
part
of
the
sentence,
and
i
take
that
as
a
given.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
certain
number
of
days
in
the
statute
for
years,
and
it
goes
up.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
in
fact,
the
way
it
operates
it
does
not.
that
is,
it's
there,
and
you've
got
it,
unless
you
do
something
that
causes
it
to
be
revoked.
incentive
gain
time
is
handled
differently,
and
of
course
the
overcrowding
credits
themselves
are,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
scalia,
for
an
