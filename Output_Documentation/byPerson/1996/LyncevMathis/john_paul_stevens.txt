mr.
remland,
i
don't
think
you've
made
a
point
clear
that
i
think
is
really
of
vital
importance.
don't
you
claim
that
under
the
1983
statute
your
client
had
right,
a
statutory
right
to
overcrowding
credits
not
in
a
then
emergency,
but
if
a
later
emergency
occurred
when
there
was
a
98-percent
population
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
the
formula
your
client
had
a
right
to
at
the
time
the
offense
was
committed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
formula
that
was
actually
applied
also
was
a
98-percent
formula,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
way
there
would
have
gotten
1,800
days
of
gain
time
otherwise,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
get
the
overcrowding
gain
time
unless
you
also
qualify
for
good
behavior,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
isn't
it
an
ex
post
facto
problem
if
there
was
a
1983
statute
on
the
books
that
authorized
the
gain
time
when
the
prison
population
exceeded
98
percent,
the
same
formula
that
you
used
under
the
labor
statutes?
why
isn't
that
an
ex
post
facto
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
titled
emergency--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--entitled
emergency
release
of
prisoners.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
says
it
will
take
care
of
it
if
the
population
reaches
98
percent.
it
looked
to
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
emergency
had
not
necessarily
occurred
at
the
time
that
statute
was
passed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was...
they
were
released
under
the
formula
that
was
set
forth
in
that
statute,
which
was
incorporated
into
a
later
statute.
in
the
98
percent
formula
was
incorporated
in
the
later
statute
which
actually
gave
rise
to
his
credits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
more
discretionary
than
the
earlier
statute.
the
earlier
statute
has
mandatory
language
in
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
the
later
ones
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
whatever...
whatever
happened
later,
he
was
entitled
under
the
earlier
statute
because
he
qualified
under
the
later
one,
which
was
even
less
generous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
sure
we
do,
because
it
was
a
98-percent
formula,
and
you
calculated
the
98-percent
formula
later
and
gave
him
1,800
days
of
credits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
gain
time
is
never
cast
in
stone
as
part
of
a
person's
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
discovered
that
with
the
weaver
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear,
your
argument
really
depends
on...
assumes
that
the
releases
could
have
been
under
the
1983
statute,
but
they're
still
not
covered
because
it's
a
collateral
effect
that
caused
him
to
become
eligible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
have
been
true
under
the
'83
statute
or
the
later
statutes...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
thomson,
does
the
record
tell
us
how
much
of
the
1,860
days
were
overcrowding
credits
and
how
much
was
the
other
kind
of
gain
time
you
refer
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
so
i'm
perfectly
clear,
the
1,860
is
all
overcrowding
gain
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
at
least
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice
these
additional
increments
of
gain
time
were
accumulated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
the
statute
says.
ninety-seven
percent
of
lawful
capacity
of
the
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
