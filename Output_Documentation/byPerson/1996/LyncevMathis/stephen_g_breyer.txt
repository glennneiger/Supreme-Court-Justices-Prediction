well,
if
it
takes
too
long
you
might
just
refer
me
to
a
source.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
only
question
is
how
you
get
from
the
words
30
days,
or
60
days,
to
the
1,800
that
he
accumulated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
do
we
get
to
1,800?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
it
happen
31
times?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
my
question
would
be
this.
the
statute
says,
really,
what
you're
saying
is
that
that's
what
shall
happen.
the
statutes
say
it
shall
happen.
they
say
it
shall
happen
as
of
1983.
now,
since
they
say
it
shall
happen
and
you
have
a
later
statute
that
comes
along
that
says
in
his
case
it
shall
not
happen,
how
can
we
look
at
it
as
other
than
you
had
a
later
statute
that
made
his
sentence
more
harsh.
now,
what
you
were
starting
to
say
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
the
purpose
is
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
the
purpose
is
different,
i
guess
if
you
had
a
good
purpose
you
could
double
everybody's
sentence
on
that
theory.
