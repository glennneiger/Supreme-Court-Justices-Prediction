mr.
remland--
--well,
i
thought
your
principal
response
to
this
was
that
it
simply
was
not
raised
in
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
we
took
this
case
we
thought
we
were
dealing
with
a
situation
which
involved
a
change
of
the
punishment
that
existed
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
there's
no
overcrowding?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
no
overcrowding
at
the
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
nonetheless
get
released
early?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
called
provisional,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understood
it
was
called
provisional
because
you
only
get
your
overcrowding
time
if
there's
overcrowding.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
wasn't
effect
of
law.
it
was
a
regulation
that
was
adopted
by
the
prison
administrator.
pursuant
to
his
authority
the
legislature
told
him,
you
have
to
comply
with
the
federal
court
decree.
you
decide...
you
know,
you
decide
the
people
that
can
best
be
released
upon
the
public,
and
he
said
pickpockets,
and
he
issued
that
in
a
regulation.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
that
administrative
measure
becomes
part
of
the
sentence
that
the
person
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it's
for
administrative
purposes,
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
it's
adopted
by
regulation
versus
statute
should
make
any
difference.
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
effect's
the
same.
he's
a
pickpocket
and
he
would
have
gotten
out
if
that
measure
had
been
continued.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
thomson,
your
argument,
or
at
least
a
large
part
of
your
argument
is
that
you
shouldn't
count
this
because
it's
not
punishment.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
punishment.
it
had
to
do
with
administrative
needs,
administrative
efficiency.
but
isn't
the
same
thing
true
of
good
behavior
release
time
as
well?
that
has
nothing...
you
know,
earned
credits
for
good
time
credits.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
heinousness
of
the
crime.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
is
deserved
punishment.
it
has
to
do
with
giving
people
an
incentive
to
behave
themselves
so
that
it
will
be
easier
to
manage
the
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
suggests
that
our
prior
case
law
is
an
impediment
to
the
argument
you're
making
to
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
we
have
certainly
held
that
you
can't
take
away
good
time
credits,
change
the
system
under
which
you
earn
them
retroactively.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
conditioned
on
good
behavior,
though,
as
you
told
us
earlier,
so
to
that
extent
it
is
still
somewhat
conditioned
upon
his
own
behavior.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what...
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by...
i'm
not
sure
how
that
responds
to
my
point.
he
has
to
place
himself
within
that
pool
by
his
good
behavior,
no?
