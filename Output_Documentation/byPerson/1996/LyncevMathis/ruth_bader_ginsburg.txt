that
statute
was
applied
to
no
one,
ever,
right?
it
was
never
applied,
that
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
all
later,
but
the
statute
that
was
on
the
books
at
the
time
the
offense
was
committed
is
a
statute
that
was
never
applied
to
anyone.
it's
a
little
hard
to
talk
about
anything
ex
post
facto
with
respect
to
a
law
that
was
never
applied
to
anyone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
remland,
what
about...
the
statute
that
was
in
place
was
an
emergency
statute.
could
one
really
say
that
it
was
going
to
operate,
or
it
wasn't
at
all
highly
speculative
what
would
become
of
that
emergency
measure,
then?
it's
not
like
your
punishment
is
x,
and
your
good
time
credit
is
y.
it
was
a
brand
new
thing
on
an
emergency
basis,
and
could
one
say
not
this...
this
is...
i
know
what
this
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
the
florida
courts
so
construed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
measure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
weaver...
in
weaver,
it
depended
upon
what
existed
at
the
time
the
offense
was
committed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
remland,
suppose
florida
had
said,
we
are
enacting
a
statute
that
doesn't
give
anybody
any
right
to
anything
until
the
moment
that
there
is
overcrowding,
and
when
they're...
when
and
if
the
overcrowding
occurs,
they
will
get
credits,
but
those
credits
will
exist
only
as
long
as
the
overcrowding.
once
there's
no
more
overcrowding,
no
more
accumulation,
and
we
wipe
away
any
that
exist
if
you
haven't
gotten
out.
that
kind
of
statute,
then,
would
have
no
constitutional
problem,
would
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
statute
says
these
credits
you
accumulate,
and
if
you
get
out
while
we're
still
overcrowded,
that's
all
right,
but
when
we
build
the
new
prison,
they're
wiped
out.
is
there
any
constitutional
problem
with
florida
doing
that?
