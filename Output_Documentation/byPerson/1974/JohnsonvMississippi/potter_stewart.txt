in
rachel
the
charge
was
trespass,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
hamm
had
been
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
(c),
i
believe.
justice

even
if
they
could
be
convicted,
and
maybe
they
could,
depending
of
course
on
what
the
actual
facts
might
be,
that's
not
enough
to
justify
removal
as
was
pointed
out
in
peacock?
justice
potter
stewart
they
pointed
out
that
there
was
one
of
the
remedies
with
the
criminal
--
with
the
federal
criminal
laws,
as
well
as
the
federal
civil
law?
justice
potter
stewart
the
criminal
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
true
about
the
--
it's
equally
true,
isn't
it,
about
the
civil
statutes,
the
civil
right
statutes
going
back
to
the
reconstruction
days?
justice
potter
stewart
which
were
involved?
what
you
said
about
this
criminal
statute
is
equally
true
about
the
federal
civil
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
we
held
--
the
court
held,
did
it
not,
in
the
city
of
greenwood
case
that
that
wasn't
enough.
if
there
wasn't
enough
to
protect
the
right,
the
statute
had
to
confer
the
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
part
of
the
holding
but
some
of
the
statutes
were?
