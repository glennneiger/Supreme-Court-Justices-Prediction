justice

powell,

does
your
position
depend
upon
the
soundness
of
a
prediction
that
the
rights
of
your
clients
cannot
be
vindicated
in
the
state
courts?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
the
rachel
the
statute
as
i
recall
of
banned
attempts
to
punish
in
the
state
courts
violation
of
state
trespass
laws
and
you
analogize
the
statute
here
involved
to
that
language?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
all
of
this
ten
in
your
opinion
on
a
factual
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
picketing
was
peaceful
and
lawful?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
factual
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that
was
the
issue
in
the
removal
proceeding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
thought
the
district
judge
in
this
case
found
as
a
fact
that
there
was
unlawful
picketing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
this
as
an
issue
before
us?

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
after
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
parker,
in
responding
to
mr.
justice
white,
you
stated
as
i
understood
you,
that
if
a
defendant
could
show
that
the
charged
were
fraudulent
or
brought
in
bad
faith
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
removal.
if
those
showings
could
be
made,
he
also
would
be
entitled
to
an
injunction,
younger
would
not
preclude
it,
would
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
say
you'd
have
alternative
remedies?
