justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
--
don't
you
have
to
show
under
peacock
that
they
have
an
unqualified
right
to
do
what
they
were
charged
with
doing
and
not
just
that
they
had
an
unqualified
right
to
do
what
they
in
fact
might
have
been
found
to
be
doing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
activity
where
they
charged
with
in
the
mississippi
criminal
prosecution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
the
charge,
not
the
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
now
don't
you
have
to
show
under
peacock
that
the
federal
statute
you're
relying
on
gave
them
an
unqualified
right
to
feloniously
and
injuriously
do
what
they
were
doing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
were
charged
with
doing
something
more
than
that,
weren't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
evidence,
that's
not
the
charge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
not
the
charge
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
it's
not
the
charged
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
policeman's
threat
to
take
the
man
to
jail.
i
mean,
couldn't
that
qualify
as
a
threat
of
force
under
the
federal
statute?
