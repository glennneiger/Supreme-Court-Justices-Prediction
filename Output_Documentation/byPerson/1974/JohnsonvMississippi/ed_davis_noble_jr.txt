mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
address
myself
some
of
the
facts
brought
out
by
counsel
opposite.
while
it's
quite
true
that
we
admitted
in
our
brief
that
that
there
was
at
one
time
or
another
activities
which
might
border
on
free
speech.
that
was
not
why
these
individuals
were
charged.
they
were
charged
for
other
activities
not
for
free
speech
at
one
time
or
another.
next,
it
was
brought
out
that
they
were
charged
initially
under
97-1-1
of
the
mississippi
code
of
1972.
that
is
true,
but
while
on
remand
by
the
district
court,
and
before
the
appeal
was
perfected,
the
grand
jury
of
warren
county,
mississippi
met
in
session
on
march
12,
1973
and
charged
these
individuals
under
97-3-83
and
97-23-85
which
specifically
addressed
themselves
to
secondary
boycott
activities
and
threats
or
force
in
the
use
of
affecting
normal
and
lawful
business
activities.
this
is
clearly
a
case
of
interpretation
of
rachel
and
peacock,
may
it
please
the
court
and
in
that
sense
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
individuals
rely
on
18
u.s.c.
245
(b).
in
doing
so,
throughout
their
brief,
they
cannot
cite
a
particular
case
either
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
or
in
the
district
court,
which
in
and
of
themselves
effect
removal
that
is
triggered
under
1443
(1).
we
think
that
is
correct.
it
cannot
be
analogized
with
1443
(1)
requirements
because
it
is
not
a
civil
statute,
it
is
a
criminal
statute.
it
protects,
it
does
not
provide
and
in
that
protection
it
actually
protects
rights
which
have
already
been
granted
either
by
statutes
of
the
united
states
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
is
clearly
brought
out,
may
it
please
the
court
in
the
congressional
history
of
this
particular
statute,
first
by
the
house
of
representatives.
in
the
initial
statement
which
we
allude
to
in
our
brief
by
congressman
cellar,
he
speaks
of
four
objectives.
first,
that
it
protects
individuals
in
the
sense
of
force
or
interference
in
civil
rights
that
is
force
itself.
secondly,
that
it
spells
out
those
particular
activities
which
would
be
protected
in
this
--
by
this
criminal
statute.
thirdly,
it
brings
individuals
who
are
participating
in
activities
within
the
protection
of
the
criminal
nature
of
this
statute.
and
fifth
and
more
importantly,
twice
in
the
statute,
it
spells
out
the
penalties
which
are
assessed,
if
it
is
found
by
a
jury
that
an
individual
has
been
participating
in
these
activities.
it's
quite
true
as
counsel
opposite
said
that
a
jury
must
find,
but
we
think
that
is
in
a
criminal
nature
of
itself
and
not
in
a
civil
nature.
the
senate
in
the
majority
report
791
specifically
states
that
it
is
to
protect
individuals
against
acts
of
violence.
there's
no
indication
that
this
particular
statute
is
for
the
ongoing
of
criminal
processes
of
a
state.
and
of
course
individuals
should
be
acting
lawfully,
which
these
individuals
were
not.
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
clear.
it
is
codified
in
the
us
code
as
a
criminal
statute.
it
begins
in
section
(a)
by
speaking
that
it
does
not
in
and
of
itself
cut
loose
the
state
processes
which
might
be
charged
under
this
particular
statute,
and
that
if
no
charges,
no
charges
shall
be
brought
under
this
statute
by
the
attorney
general,
by
the
department
of
justice
without
first
the
written
permission
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
its
deputy
and
a
conclusion
that
,that
particular
charge
is
in
the
public
interest.
18
u.s.c.
245
is
criminal,
therefore,
it
does
not
meet
the
prerequisites
of
either
rachel
or
peacock.
rachel
has
two
prerequisites.
first,
that
the
statute
must
provide
for
equal
civil
rights
stated
in
terms
of
racial
equality
and
secondly
that
it
must
proven
and
clearly
predicted
that
that
particular
right
will
be
denied
or
cannot
be
--
can
be
denied
in
the
state
court.
like
we
said
in
the
first
instance,
this
is
a
criminal
statute
which
provides
protection.
it
does
not
provide
new
rights.
245
(b)
spells
out
specific
instances,
ten
in
fact
which
are
protected
by
the
statute.
therefore,
it
does
not
come
within
the
1866
model
as
this
court
projected
in
rachel,
in
a
decision
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
for
in
the
1866
model,
it
granted
and
therefore
guaranteed
new
rights
to
citizens
of
the
united
states.
there
has
been
some
argument
about
whether
or
not
this
particular
statute
grants
or
removal
protects
the
rights
of
one
who
is
engaged
in
first
amendment
or
fourteenth
amendment
rights
such
as
picketing.
if
this
court
were
to
decide
this,
it
would
seem
to
be
cutting
back
or
reversing
the
dictates
of
rachel
and
peacock
in
particular.
for
in
those
two
cases
when
read
together,
this
court
decided
in
1966
that
the
broad
panoply
of
first
amendment
rights
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
are
not
protected
by
removal.
as
i
mentioned
previously,
this
appeal
is
now
constituted
of
six
individuals
who
are
now
under
indictment
by
the
warren
county
grand
jury
in
warren
county,
mississippi.
they
are
charged
with
criminal
conspiracy
in
effecting
a
secondary
boycott
and
they
are
charged
with
use
of
force
and
intimidation
to
affect
that
in.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
they
did.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
they
did.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
it
was
explained
in
oral
argument
and
that
question
put
to
us
where
the
posture
of
the
case
stood
at
that
particular
time
and
it
came
out
in
oral
argument
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
only
two
of
six
actually,
four
are
charged
with
the
criminal
conspiracy
and
secondary
boycott
and
the
two
as
my
understanding
by
through
that
--
by
conversations
with
the
district
attorney
since
we
do
not
handle
--
my
office
does
not
handle
these
charges.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
two
are
charged
under
the
force
and
effect
statute
that
is
9723
(83)
and
four
are
charged
with
secondary
boycott
statute
9723
(85).
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
a
removal
hearing
was
had?
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
no,
sir
it
would
not.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
well,
under
rachel
and
peacock
in
its
interpretation
of
1443
(1),
first
amendment
rights
in
and
of
themselves
are
not
removable.
you
must
look
to
the
charges
that
are
against
these
individuals.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
i
still
do
not
think
under
rachel
and
peacock
that
this
particular
instance
of
picketing
would
in
and
of
itself
constitute
removal,
no,
sir,
for
this
reason.
it
requires
two
things
for
removal,
according
to
rachel's
precepts,
that
you
prove
a
specific
civil
rights
stated
in
terms
of
racial
equality
and
secondly,
that
those
particular
rights
would
be
denied
in
the
state
courts
of
georgia
and
mississippi.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
state
of
mississippi
has
no
particular
statute
which
denies
one
the
right
to
picket
nor
does
the
city
of
vicksburg
as
it's
shown
in
the
evidence
of
the
case
by
testimony
by
chief
brown,
nor
does
the
city
of
vicksburg
have
any
ordinance
which
denies
one
the
right
to
peacefully
picket.
therefore,
they
would
come
under
and
satisfy
this
particular
right
through
an
appeal
in
state
court.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
according
to
rachel
and
peacock,
that's
true
sir.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
true.
however,
you
had
a
conflict
with
the
state
statute
--
federal
and
state
statute
shortly
before
you
decide
in
the
rachel.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
hamm
have
been
decided,
there
interpreting
19
--
2000
(a).
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
(c)
which
said
that
public
accommodations
act
granted
a
specific
right,
therefore,
it's
substituted
a
right
for
a
crime.
here,
there
is
no
substitution
for
even
given
245,
it
substitutes
no
right
to
participate
in
the
crimes
charged
by
state
of
mississippi
against
these
individuals.
so,
removal
is
not
effective.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
or
i'd
like
to
paraphrase
if
i
might,
peacock,
that
this
case
differs
from
what
is
alleged
in
the
petition
in
this
ways.
there
is
no
federal
statute,
in
particular
245
(b),
or
any
statute
on
the
books
which
gives
these
individuals
the
right
to
participate
in
a
secondary
boycott
or
to
intimidate
one
in
its
normal
cost
of
business
activities,
nor
is
there
any
statute
which
has
been
cited
to
replace,
to
allude
to
the
question
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
what
was
it?
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
was
brought
out
that
these
people
were
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
stop
individuals
from
participating
in
ongoing
business
activities
with
the
certain
individuals
in
the
city
of
vicksburg.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
according
to
the
state
statute,
it
is.
not
in
the
sense
of
telling
someone
to
do
it,
but
they
were
using
activities
to
stop,
said
to
have
engaged
in
a
secondary
boycott,
that's
right.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
was
a
charge.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
well,
according
--
without
all
due
respect
--
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
with
all
due
respect
to
you,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
can
only
represent
to
you
what
the
indictment
says.
they
are
charged
with
secondary
boycott
and
intimidation
of
the
individuals
and
patrons
going
into
these
particular
stores.
those
are
the
two
charges
against
these
individuals.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
absolutely,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
the
statute
speaks,
the
federal
statute
and
which
they
allude
to,
245
(b),
specifically
refers
to
force
or
threats
of
force
in
the
following
activities
and
if
they
do
so,
and
if
you
go
to
the
bottom
statute
then
they
maybe
find
or
if
there's
imprisonment
involved.
if
--
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
i
wouldn't
think
that
--
i
would
say
that
would
be,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
would
be
a
threat
but
not
--
there
was
no
force
involved
here.
the
only
thing
that
was
affected
here
in
the
city
of
vicksburg
were
the
ongoing
criminal
processes.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
that
was
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
they
have
several
remedies
which
they
may
take
advantage
of
which
you
spoke
too
in
your
opinion,
that
is
injunctive
process,
habeas
perhaps
damages.
mr.
ed
davis
noble,
jr.
right,
perhaps,
criminal
prosecution
and
of
course
appeal
throughout
the
state
system
and
to
this
court
itself.
