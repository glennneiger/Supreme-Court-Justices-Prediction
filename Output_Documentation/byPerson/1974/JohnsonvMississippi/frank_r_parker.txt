mr.
frank
r.
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
removed
these
mississippi
criminal
prosecutions
from
the
state
court
to
federal
district
court
pursuant
to
the
civil
rights
removal
statute
28
u.s.
code,
section
1443
which
dates
back
to
1866.
the
state
filed
an
answer
and
a
motion
to
remand.
the
district
court
held
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
state's
remand
motion,
granted
the
motion,
and
remanded
these
criminal
prosecutions
back
to
the
state
court.
on
appeal
by
the
petitioners,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
and
a
divided
court
by
a
vote
of
ten
to
five
with
a
very
strong
dissent
by
chief
judge
john
brown,
denied
a
re-hearing
en
banc.
the
question
to
review
is
whether
petitioners
engaged
in
peaceful
free
speech
activity
designed
to
eliminate
racial
discrimination,
may
remove
state
criminal
prosecutions
against
them,
to
federal
district
court
pursuant
to
the
civil
rights
removal
statute
to
protect
their
peaceful
exercise
of
rights
secured
by
the
title
i
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968,
which
is
contained
in
the
federal
code
under
the
title
federally
protected
activities,
and
as
codified
as
18
u.s.
code,
section
245
(b).
i
think
it's
undisputed
and
the
state
doesn't
dispute
this
in
its
brief
that
at
the
time
of
the
arrests
the
petitioners
were
and
had
been
engaged
in
free
speech
activity
specifically
protected
against
official
interference
by
18
u.s.
code,
section
245
(b).
the
police
officers
knew
this
and
this
activity
formed
the
basis
for
these
arrests.
the
petitioners
all
were
arrested
on
identical
arrest
affidavits
warranted
by
the
chief
of
police,
which
charged
with
unlawfully
and
feloniously
to
bring
about
a
boycott
of
merchants
and
businesses,
in
there
promote,
encourage
and
enforce
acts
injurious
to
trade
or
commerce,
under
mississippi
code
section
97-1-1.
now,
although
the
testimony
of
the
police
chief,
who
was
the
only
witness
to
testify
for
the
state,
does
contain
reports
and
complaints
that
he
had
received
that
there
had
been
some
interference
with
the
merchants
and
the
shoppers,
there
is
evidence
at
all
in
the
record
that
any
of
these
petitioners
themselves
are
guilty
of
any
of
this
unlawful
conduct,
guilty
of
harassing
or
intimidating
any
shopper
or
merchant,
and
the
state
cites
none
in
its
brief.
the
petitioners
were
arrested
solely
and
exclusively
because
of
their
peaceful
free
speech
activity
designed
to
protest
and
eliminate
racial
discrimination.
as
the
petitioner
john
ferguson
testified
and
his
testimony
was
not
contradicted
when
he
was
booked,
he
heard,
police
chief
brown
of
vicksburg
comment,
“anybody
on
the
street
with
a
picket
sign
would
be
arrested”
and
that's
what
happened.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
does
meet
the
peacock
standard.
first
of
all,
the
statute
invokes
section
245
(b).
it
does
establish
a
right
for
them
to
engage
in
this
activity
and
secondly
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
the
evidence
--
the
evidence
reveals
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
charge
was
to
unlawfully
and
feloniously
bring
about
a
boycott
of
merchants
and
businesses
and
to
promote
and
encourage
acts
injurious
to
trade
or
commerce.
now,
this
necessarily
must
involve
free
speech
activity.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
we
think
that's
true
in
this
case.
the
federal
statute
does
give
them
an
unqualified
right
to
engage
in
a
free
speech
and
peaceful
assembly
to
oppose
the
denial
of
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
enumerated
benefits
and
activities
under
the
statute,
including
private
employment
without
discrimination.
so,
the
defendants
under
this
statute
had
an
unqualified
right
to
engage
in
free
speech
activity
opposing
racial
discrimination
and
employment
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
boycott.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
we
don't
believe
they
were,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
they
were
specifically
charged
with
the
protected
activity
under
the
statute.
and
certainly,
even
are
going
behind
the
charges,
the
testimony
of
the
police
chief
himself
when
he
asked
what
were
these
petitioners
doing
prior
to
their
arrest
responded,
they
were
stopping
people
and
telling
people
not
to
stop
in
the
shore
--
in
the
stores
that
there
was
boycott
on
and
the
purpose
of
this
boycott
as
the
testimony
reveals
was
to
protest
racial
discrimination
of
employment.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
was
the
basis
of
the
charge.
it
was
that
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
--
evidence
that
was
the
basis
of
the
arrest.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
the
charge
of
boycotting,
and
the
charge
of
restraining
trade
necessarily
contains
elements
which
contradict
the
protected
activity
guaranteed
by
the
statute
because
the
boycott
necessarily
involves
word
of
mouth
publicity,
free
speech
activity
to
persuades
shoppers
not
stop
in
the
stores
and
that's
specifically
protected
by
the
statute.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
the
relief
that
we're
requesting
in
federal
district
court.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
i
think
the
posture
in
the
state
court
would
have
been
more
of
constitutional
question
whether
the
state
statute
under
which
the
charges
are
broad
--
are
over
broad
and
whether
they
conflict
with
the
federal
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
one
of
the
tests
that
the
court
laid
down.
however,
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
necessarily
test.
in
other
words,
if
the
petitioners
in
rachel
had
been
charged
with
trespass,
in
rachel
they
succeeded
and
the
court
sustained
the
removal,
if
the
petitioners
in
rachel
had
not
been
charged
with
trespass,
but
had
been
charged
with
aggravated
burglary
for
example,
or
murder,
or
rape,
the
result
should
have
been
no
different
because
the
facts
of
that
case
clearly
showed
and
they
are
alleged
properly
in
the
removal
petition
that
the
charges
were
based
upon
their
refusal
to
leave
the
restaurant
after
they
were
asked
to
do
so
because
of
their
race
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
evidentiary
hearing.
rachel
requires
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court
to
establish
the
facts
and
permit
petitioners
to
prove
the
allegations
of
the
petition,
and
once
they've
done
that
and
shown
that
the
arrests
are
based
unprotected
activity
then
i
have
the
right
of
removal
under
rachel.
the
testimony
as
i've
mentioned
--
the
testimony
of
police
chief
marion
brown
himself
indicates
that
the
basis
of
these
arrests
were
the
free
speech
activity
of
the
petitioners
protesting
racial
discrimination,
and
that
of
course
is
protected
specifically
by
the
statute.
now,
these
mass
arrests
as
the
testimony,
uncontradicted
testimony
indicates,
brought
a
complete
halt
to
any
picketing
in
vicksburg
designed
to
protest
to
eliminate
racial
discrimination
and
that
complete
halt
at
any
racial
protest
picketing
in
vicksburg
continues
down
to
the
present
day
and
i
think
from
these
facts
the
conclusions
can
be
drawn
are
clear.
these
arrests
were
made
in
bad
faith.
it
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
these
petitioners
in
the
peaceful
exercise
of
their
federally
protected
free-speech
rights
to
protest
racial
discrimination.
and
they
were
made
under
a
state
conspiracy
statute
which
is
extremely
questionable,
punishes
any
acts
injurious
to
trade
and
commerce,
punishes
any
acts
injurious
to
public
health,
public
morals,
using
vague
terms
and
over
broad
terms
which
can
be
easily
used
to
suppress
free
speech
rights
as
was
done
in
this
case,
and
this
was
done
to
the
great
and
immediate
irreparable
injury
of
the
petitioners
and
persons
similarly
situated.
now,
the
purpose
congress
in
enacting
this
removal
statute,
and
it
goes
back
1866,
it
was
reenacted
in
1870,
reenacted
in
1871,
and
congress
in
1964
took
another
look
at
the
removal
statute
and
provided
an
appeal
to
strengthen
its
provisions.
congress
has
over
the
past
century
intended
to
provide
a
federal
forum
in
instances
in
which
a
conduct
by
state
officials,
violates
equal
civil
rights
of
the
petitioners
and
those
rights
are
denied
or
cannot
be
enforced
in
the
state
court.
in
enacting
the
civil
rights
removal
statute,
congress
carved-out
a
narrow
but
expresses
an
exception
to
the
usual
doctrine
against
the
federal
court
interference
with
state
criminal
prosecutions.
under
1443
removal
of
state
criminal
prosecutions
of
the
federal
district
court,
this
is
justified
where
petitioners
can
rely
upon
a
right
under
law
providing
for
the
equal
civil
rights
of
citizens
and
rachel
construed
this
to
mean
and
stated
in
specifically
in
terms
of
the
racial
equality.
so,
we're
not
arguing
that
the
court
include
in
this
civil
rights
removal
petition
a
broad
spectrum
of
what
we
generally
classify
as
civil
rights
or
constitutional
rights
or
civil
liberties.
this
is
a
very
narrow
statute,
can
be
narrowly
construed
but
covers
this
case
because
this
statute
undeniably
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
section
245
(b)
clearly
deals
with
equal
civil
rights.
this
statute
undeniably
is
a
statute
providing
for
equal
civil
rights
stated
in
terms
of
racial
equality
and
that's
indicated
by
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
statute.
in
our
opinion,
the
fifth
circuit
completely
ignored
the
legislative
history
and
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
statute
because
the
committee
reports
and
the
quotations
which
we
include
in
our
brief
indicate
that
the
congress
intended
to
protect
persons
engaged
in
free
speech
activity
protesting
racial
discrimination.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
of
course
that's
another
case,
they
weren't
charge
with
that
here.
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
again,
the
same
--
i
believe
the
same
standards
that
apply
to
regulation
of
first
amendment
conduct
would
apply.
certainly,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
regulating
time
and
place.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
this
not
first
amendment.
this
is
a
statutory,
this
is
the
right
created
by
congress
of
free
speech
right.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
that
the
statute
indicates
of
the
conduct
of
the
persons
engaged
in
this
free
speech
activity
must
be
lawful,
and
so
therefore,
if
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners
in
that
case
have
violated
the
state
statute
then
and
the
state
established
this
by
the
evidence
that
they
violated
a
constitutional
ordinance
or
state
statute,
then
we
would
take
our
position
that
removal
would
not
allowed.
that
the
prosecution
was
based
not
on
an
effort
to
suppress
free
speech
activity,
but
was
based
on
enforcement
of
a
constitutionally
valid
ordinance
or
state
statute.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
the
state
has
changed
its
position
a
couple
of
times
during
the
course
of
the
litigation.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
initial
charge
was
under
97-1-1,
that
is
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
or
commerce.
that
was
the
charge
that
was
initially
lodged
and
then
later
on
appeal
they
change
that,
but
it's
clear
to
us
that
the
notion
of
the
restraining
trade
and
commerce
is
sufficiently
broad
to
cover
the
free
speech
activity
which
is
protected
by
the
federal
statute
because
a
civil
rights
boycott
which
we
had
in
this
case
in
which
various
merchants
are
accused
of
racial
discrimination
in
their
employment
practices
and
persons
are
urged
to
not
to
shop
in
these
stores,
this
can
be
considered
by
the
state
a
restraint
of
trade
or
commerce,
that
is
the
costumers
stay
out
of
the
store
as
part
of
the
boycott.
but
even
though
it
might
be
restraining
trade
or
commerce
under
the
state
statute,
it's
protected
by
the
--
by
section
245
(b)
because
it
is
free
speech
activity
protesting
racial
discrimination
in
private
employment
and
that's
specifically
covered
by
the
statute
--
by
section
245
(b).
the
other
part
of
the
removal
section
that
we
have
to
show,
is
that
petitioners
are
denied
or
cannot
enforce
their
rights
--
their
equal
civil
rights
in
state
court.
now,
the
statute
invoked
is
--
is
very
specific
on
this.
it
prohibits
whoever
whether
or
not
acting
under
color
of
law
and
this
specifically
refers
to
law
enforcement
officers
by
force
or
threat
of
force
and
this
refers
to
any
threatening
conduct
willfully
injures,
intimidates
or
interferes
with
or
attempts
to
injure,
intimidate
or
interfere
with,
the
exercise
of
protected
rights.
now,
of
course
if
these
mass
arrests,
based
on
the
free
speech
activity
of
the
petitioners,
are
not
intimidation
or
interference,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
so
from
the
very
instigation
of
these
arrests,
the
arrest
affidavits
were
attested
to
by
the
city
judge,
these
petitioners
are
denied
and
they
cannot
enforce
in
state
courts
their
rights
because
the
statute
involved
here,
the
federal
equal
civil
rights
statute
provides
a
right
as
the
statute
did
in
rachel,
not
even
to
prosecuted
for
the
exercise
of
protected
activity.
it
prohibits
any
interference,
any
intimidation
including
arrests
and
prosecutions.
the
removal,
we
contend,
is
based,
grows
out
of
the
court's
decision
in
1966
in
georgia
and
rachel.
georgia
and
rachel
involved
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
title
ii
is
the
statutory
scheme
which
is
very
close
and
very
closely
resembles
section
245
(b)
which
we're
invoking
in
this
case.
as
i
indicated,
the
court
held
that
you
have
to
rely
on
a
statute
of
federal
law
providing
for
equal
civil
rights
stated
in
terms
of
racial
equality.
the
court
in
rachel
held
that
title
ii
qualified
because
it
prohibited
racial
discrimination
in
places
of
public
accommodation.
similarly,
the
statute
invoked
here,
section
245
(b)
clearly
qualifies
of
such
a
law.
it
clearly
deals
with
the
equal
civil
rights
as
the
fifth
circuit
itself
acknowledged.
it
prohibits
forcible
interference
because
of
race
with
the
enumerated
activities
mentioned
and
it
clearly
provides
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
to
be
free
of
any
interference
from
official
sources
with
their
free
speech
activity
protesting
racial
discrimination.
now
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
section
245
(b)
as
a
criminal
statute
is
not
a
law
which
provides
for
equal
civil
rights,
but
this
holding
is
completely
contrary
to
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
indicates
to
the
contrary.
on
august
15,
1967,
representative
madden
at
113
congressional
record
22670
said,
referring
to
the
statute,
“the
pending
legislation
will
provide
the
means
and
weapons
to
effectively
enforce
the
provisions
set
out
guaranteeing
all
american
citizens
equal
rights.”
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
i
believe
the
court
in
peacock,
mr.
justice
white
rejected
1983
because
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes
but
we
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
it's
not.
the
statute
invoked,
has
to
be
a
federal
equal
right
statute
providing
specifically
stated
in
terms
of
racial
equality
and
the
court
in
peacock
held
that
first
amendment
due
process
clause,
1983
did
not
qualify
as
federal
laws
providing
for
equal
civil
rights
stated
specifically
in
terms
of
racial
equality
and
this
statute
passed
in
1968
we
believe
fills
this
void.
and
as
much
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
would
qualify.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that's
correct.
that
it's
this
--
the
civil
rights
removal
is
much
narrower
than
the
1983
rights.
it
only
covers
activity,
free
speech
activity
involving
racial
discrimination,
protesting
racial
discrimination.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
statute
provides
a
right
to
be
free
of
interference.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
yes
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
the
legislation,
i
suppose,
would
be
constitutional,
yes,
but
the
first
amendment
is
not
--
does
not
qualify
the
court
held
in
peacock
as
the
statute
providing
for
rights
in
terms
of
racial
equality.
it
has
to
be
--
the
statute
has
to
be
racial
legislation
from
congress
designed
to
protect
persons,
protesting
and
engaged
in
a
certain
conduct,
protesting
racial
discrimination
and
that
the
statute
we
contend
clearly
qualifies
in
this
instance.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
mr.
justice
powell,
in
this
case
the
prediction
is
a
certainty
because
the
statute
invoked
provides
a
right
not
even
to
be
prosecuted
in
state
courts,
as
the
statute
did
in
rachel.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
in
other
words
--
the
equal
civil
rights
which
are
provided
by
the
statute
are
include
an
equal
civil
right
to
be
free
of
any
interference
from
official
sources
for
engaging
in
protected
activity
and
this
would
include
prosecutions.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes,
the
statute
in
rachel
which
was
section
203
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
had
three
sections
there.
one,
section
(b)
was
“no
person
shall
intimidate,
threaten
or
coerce
any
person
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
protected
rights
or
punish
or
attempt
to
punish
any
person
for
exercising
or
attempting
to
exercise
these
protected
rights.”
of
course
the
“intimidate,
threaten
or
coerce”
language
of
title
ii
is
identical
to
the
language
indicated
in
the
statute.
that
it's
clear
also
that
even
in
this
statute,
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
prevent
the
state
from
punishing
persons
for
the
exercise
of
protected
rights
and
this
is
indicated
by
the
quote
from
representative
cellar
at
page
10
of
the
state's
brief,
the
state's
quotation
of
extensive
legislative
history
is
very
helpful
in
this
regard
because
mr.
--
representative
cellar
specifically
said,
referring
to
protection
against
punishment,
he
said
for
example,
the
jury
would
have
to
find
that
the
defendant's
purpose
was
to
deter
persons
from
voting
or
applying
from
employment,
or
applying
for
admission
to
a
public
school
or
to
punish
persons,
who
have
done
so.
so,
this
legislative
history
reveals
that
part
of
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
provide
a
right
to
be
free
of
punishment
for
the
exercise
of
protected
rights.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
there
is
a
factual
issue
created.
the
plaintiffs
do
have
to
show
that
their
activity
was
protected
activity
under
the
statute.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
petitioners
do.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
there
were
two
issues
in
the
removal
proceeding.
the
first
was
the
factual
issue
whether
the
petitioner's
activity
was
protected
and
the
second
one
was
that
even
if
it
was
protected
as
a
matter
of
law
can
section
245
(b)
provide
a
basis
for
removal.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
only
reached
the
legal
issue.
the
fifth
circuit
only
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
removal
cannot
be
provided
under
the
statute.
we
believe
that
that
was
an
error
of
law
and
is
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress
as
revealed
by
the
quotes
that
we've
indicated
in
the
brief.
now,
the
factual
issue
has
yet
to
be
determined.
the
two-judge
court
rule
doesn't
apply
because
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
review
the
facts.
we
have
two
alternatives
we're
suggesting.
first
alternative
is
that
this
court
can
take
independent,
make
an
independent
examination
of
the
record
and
determine
the
facts
as
in
cox
versus
louisiana,
or
can
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
issue
of
law
and
send
it
back
and
let
them
resolve
the
facts.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
district
judge
did
so
find,
your
honor.
we
challenged
that
as
clearly
erroneous
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
reach
that
issue
because
of
its
resolution
of
the
legal
question.
i
think
that
anyone
reading
the
record
would
see
that
the
finding
is
clearly
erroneous
and
that
the
petitioner's
activities
were
peaceful
and
protected
at
all
times.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes,
i
do.
it
can
be
resolved
either
by
this
court
or
by
the
fifth
circuit
on
remand.
this
court
does
not
have
to
resolve
the
factual
issue
if
it
rules
for
us
on
the
legal
issue
and
can
simply
remand
the
case
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
for
resolution
of
the
legal
question
--
of
the
factual
question,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
court
did
in
cox
versus
louisiana.
of
course
this
was
an
appeal
from
the
state
supreme
court,
but
this
is
an
unusual
instance
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
on
our
factual
contentions.
it
simply
felt
it
was
not
unnecessary
because
of
their
view
of
the
law.
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
would
indicate
that
the
district
court's
determinations
in
this
regard
were
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
there
are
two
criminal
cases
that
we
cite
--
that
we
cite
in
our
brief.
we
discussed
this
question
at
our
brief
in
page
40
and
we
refer
specifically
to
united
states
versus
brahms
and
cole
v.
ralph,
at
page
43
of
our
brief.
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
take
the
view
and
we
only
suggest
this
to
the
court,
the
fifth
circuit
seem
to
take
the
view
that
petitioner's
activity
was
protected
because
it
starts
out
its
opinion
by
saying,
no
one
questions
the
right
of
petitioners
to
engage
in
picketing
and
free
speech
activity.
so
that
implies
to
us
that
the
fifth
circuit
believed
that
the
petitioners'
activity
was
protected
and
therefore
was
required
to
rule
on
the
legal
issue
and
we
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
will
support
that
contention.
the
court
believes
that
if
there's
any
conflict
in
this
regard
that
can
resolve
the
legal
issue
and
send
it
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
for
factual
determination.
this
was
certainly
the
procedure
followed
in
rachel.
rachel,
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing,
but
the
court
sustained
the
allegations
of
the
removal
petition
in
rachel
and
sent
the
case
back
to
the
lower
courts
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
petitioners'
allegations.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
the
indictment
is
contained
on
142
and
143.
there
is
the
boiler
plate
language
with
force
and
arms
but
that's
not
part
of
the
factual
recitation
in
the
indictment.
the
indictment
simply
charges
them
with
promoting
and
encouraging
an
unlawful
boycott,
so
as
to
prevent
by
black
persons
from
trading
or
doing
business.
but
the
testimony
of
police
chief
marion
r.
brown
indicates
that
his
notion
of
preventing
black
people
from
doing
business
is
telling
them
that
there's
a
boycott
on.
for
example,
page
126
of
the
appendix,
why
was
john
ferguson
arrested?
he
was
actually
participating
in
the
boycott
and
in
fact
the
beginning,
he
was
very
actively
participating
in
it,
that's
the
chief
of
police.
“the
only
thing
i've
seen
him,
i've
actually
seen
him
carry
a
picket
sign.
i've
seen
him
stopping
people
on
the
street
and
talking
to
them,”
that's
protected
under
the
statute.
that
according
to
the
police
chief
was
the
basis
for
the
arrests
in
this
case,
the
same
with
the
other
petitioners
as
the
evidence
is
in
the
appendix.
now,
the
state
maintains
that
a
criminal
statute,
a
federal
criminal
statute
providing
for
equal
civil
rights
cannot
be
a
statute
providing
for
equal
civil
rights
under
1443
because
it's
a
criminal
statute.
it
doesn't
compare
with
the
1866
model.
the
1866
model,
the
original
removal
petition
statute
was
a
criminal
statute.
in
section
2,
it
provided
criminal
penalties.
it
was
reenacted
in
1870
as
a
removal
statute
and
providing
criminal
penalties.
the
model
1866
was
a
criminal
statute.
a
criminal
statute
can
provide
for
equal
civil
rights.
now,
it
is
contended
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
accept
the
petitioners'
version
of
the
facts,
this
is
not
true.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
resolve
the
factual
conflict.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
accept
respondents'
version
of
the
facts.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
reach
the
factual
question
at
all.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
if
the
fact
show
that
the
charge
is
spurious.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that's
right,
if
the
prosecution
is
fraudulent.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
it's
not
contrary
to
peacock
at
all.
this
is
discussed
extensively
by
chief
judge
tuttle
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
walker
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
brief.
the
statute
in
rachel
was
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
the
charges
were
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
charge
was
trespass
and
trespass
under
georgia
law
is
refusal
to
live
the
premises
upon
requested
to
do
so
by
the
manager.
there's
no
indication
of
racial
motivation
in
the
charges.
and
it
was
only
when
the
petitioners
could
prove
that
they
were
asked
to
leave
for
racial
reasons
that
there
was
this
racial
motivation
behind
the
charge
that
they
could
succeed.
the
same
thing
here.
the
evidence
shows
that
there
was
racial
motivation
behind
these
charges.
that
the
sole
and
exclusive
purpose
of
these
charges
was
to
suppress
the
boycott,
suppress
free
speech
activity
protesting
racial
discrimination.
now,
the
statute
here
does
substitute
a
federal
right
for
a
state
crime.
if
a
boycott,
as
the
state
maintains,
is
criminal
under
state
law,
and
if
it's
criminal
to
urge
people
not
to
shop
at
these
stores
because
of
their
racially
discriminatory
hiring
policies
and
that
directly
conflicts
with
the
federal
right
under
the
statute
because
the
right
protects
any
free
speech
activity
protesting
racial
discrimination,
the
boycott
was
free
speech
activity
protesting
racial
discrimination
is
covered
by
the
statute
and
the
statute
therefore
clearly
and
directly
substitutes
a
federal
right
for
a
state
crime.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
what
is
the
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
the
court
in
peacock,
i
believe
the
ruling,
the
holding
of
the
court
was
that
those
statutes
invoked
were
not
specifically
statutes
which
were
stated
in
terms
of
racial
equality.
that
those
were
statutes
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes,
but
those
statutes,
1981
and
1971,
were
not
statutes
specifically
protected
the
conduct
and
activity
of
the
petitioners.
the
petitioners
where
engaged
in
voter
registration
activity
and
that
was
not
specifically
protected
by
either
1981
or
1971.
it
wasn't
until
congress
passed
this
statute,
section
245
(b),
that
this
free
speech
activity
protesting
racial
discrimination
was
specifically
covered
by
a
federal
law
providing
for
equal
civil
rights.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
an
evidentiary
hearing
as
required
by
rachel
and
the
court
indicated
that
the
plaintiffs
or
the
petitioners
did
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
they
were
asked
to
leave
the
restaurant
for
racial
reasons.
now,
the
state
probably
would
not
have
to
prove
that
they
were
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
certainly
i
think
that
in
the
fifth
circuit
decisions
sustain
this
that
the
state
would
have
to
establish
the
elements
of
the
crime.
in
other
words,
the
state
would,
once
the
petitioners
have
shown
and
proven
that
they
were
engaged
in
the
protected
activity
that
the
state
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that's
correct.
but
they
would
have
to
establish
the
elements
of
defense
that
the
petitioners
were
not
arrested
for
unprotected
--
for
protected
activity
but
they
were
arrested
for
unprotected
activity
and
our
contention
is
that
the
state
hasn't
met
burden
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
under
certain
circumstances,
he
would.
the
civil
rights
removal
statute
is
a
narrower
statute,
applies
only
in
cases
of
federal
equal
rights
statutes
providing
for
specific
rights
in
terms
of
racial
equality.
the
injunctive
relief
would
be
a
coordinate
remedy.
but
it's
our
contention
that
this
coordinate
remedy
should
not
preempt
the
removal
jurisdiction,
that
the
removal
jurisdiction
should
be
allowed
where
it
applies.
these
remedies
were
passed
approximately
at
the
same
time.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
the
court
certainly
in
peacock
held
that
there
were
alternative
remedies
where
the
first
amendment
rights,
for
example,
were
alleged
to
be
violated.
but
our
contention
here
is
that
if
removal
applies,
if
rachel
applies
in
this
particular
circumstance,
that
removal
should
be
allowed
because
section
245
(b)
is
a
federal
statute
providing
of
equal
civil
rights
and
does
provide
a
right
to
the
petitioners,
not
even
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
state
court.
it
provides
a
right
to
be
free
of
any
kind
of
interference
from
official
sources
with
the
exercise
of
protected
rights.
now,
of
course
we
did
file
a
1983
action,
also
in
this
case,
but
we're
unable
to
get
a
temporary
injunction
which
would
have
held
the
prosecutions
in
status
quo.
so,
the
1983
remedy
was
unavailing
in
this
case,
unavailing.
thank
you.
