justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
you
would
suggest
with
an
indictment
like
this,
it's
fine,
where
the
information
is
filed
but
if
you
would
have
been
entitled
to
dismissal
for
the
indictment,
if
you
had
moved
to
dismiss
and
cited
that
federal
statute,
that
the
federal
statute
is
an
absolute
bar
to
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that's
what
you
say
should
have
been
granted
--
it
should
have
been
granted
if
you
had
look
for
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
contesting
on
federal
statute
here
is
they
contend
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
full
complete
defense
to
going
forward
with
the
charge
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it,
you
agree
to
that
that
is
the
test
on
which
is
the
basis
for
peacock?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
1983
then
subject
to
this
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
gives
the
right
to
recover
damages
from
state
officers
if
you
interfere
say
with
free
speech
activities?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
in
a
removal
case
you
allege
and
the
state
says
well
that
maybe
true
that
you're
engaged
in
free
speech
and
that
you're
bound
to
win,
that
you're
bound
to
win
the
state
criminal
case
by
interposing
a
federal
defense,
that
isn't
enough,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
any
federal
statute
then
have
said,
no
one
will
interfere
with
free
speech
for
--
where
the
reason
for
the
interference
is
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
purely
race.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
qualify.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
right
does
the
statute
create
or
provide?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
constitution
certainly
provides
the
protection
of
the
right
--
if
the
right
is
--
if
the
origin
of
the
right
is
constitutional,
i
take
it,
in
such
a
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
appear
on
page
of
the
charge
or
the
whatever
pieces
of
paper
instituted
in
these
proceedings
in
the
state
courts.
where
do
you
--
i
gather
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
hardly
accepted
your
version?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
did
you
get
that
across
to
the
courts?
it
doesn't
appear
at
all
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
were
charging
these
people
with
the
use
of
threats
and
coercion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
representing
the
state
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
suppose
that
on
the
removal
hearing,
i
gather
you
think
that
a
removal
hearing
in
the
district
court
is
a
proper
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well
suppose
there
that
the
people
seeking
to
remove,
claim
and
demonstrate
at
least
according
to
them
that
you
arrested
for
peacefully
protesting
certain
conduct.
and
suppose
the
charge
says,
force
and
violence,
the
use
of
force
and
violence,
but
the
state
then
goes
back
and
says,
“well,
i
guess
we
really
are
just
charging
them
with
peaceful
picketing.”
would
that
be
removable
--
the
case
then
be
removable?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
--
let's
assume,
let's
assume
it's
alleged
that
the
people
were
arrested
solely
because
of
their
race,
peacefully
protesting
activities
and
they
were
arrested
solely
because
of
their
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
anytime
--
anytime
you
charge
somebody
on
the
face
of
the
complaints
with
some
act
that
was
obviously
within
the
state's
police
power,
it
could
never
be
removable,
even
though
predictably,
the
defendant
might
win
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
necessarily
saying
then
that
the
federal
statute
would
be
no
defense
to
those
charges?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
they
were
convicted,
the
people
convicted
them
couldn't
be
indicted
under
the
federal
statute
for
having
interfered
with
these
activities?
justice
byron
r.
white
put
to
jail
rather
than
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
indictment
or
the
charge
is
that
someone
killed
somebody
or
broke
in
to
some
store
or
something
--
broke
into
a
store
in
the
course
of
a
demonstration,
assume
that's
the
charge.
now,
there's
no
conflict
on
its
face
between
that
charge
and
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
you
would
say
it's
nevertheless
removable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
that
anytime
at
a
hearing
you
can
show
that
this
is
a
completely
fraudulent
prosecution
that
it
should
be
removed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that's
contrary
to
peacock?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
johnson
case,
petitioners
were
charged
in
mississippi
courts
with
the
illegal
boycott
of
local
businesses.
they
sought
to
remove
the
cases
under
28
u.s.c.
1443
(1)
which
permits
removal
when
defendants
and
local
criminal
cases
are
denied
or
cannot
enforce
their
rights
under
any
federal
law
providing
for
equal
civil
rights.
the
district
court
denied
removal
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
in
turn
affirm.
the
case
is
controlled
by
our
prior
decision
in
greenwood
against
peacock.
here
as
there,
there
is
no
federal
statute
conferring
any
rights
of
the
necessary
kind
that
are
being
denied
by
these
prosecutions
in
the
mississippi
courts.
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
with
whom
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
mr.
justice
dougla
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
and
decision
of
the
case.
