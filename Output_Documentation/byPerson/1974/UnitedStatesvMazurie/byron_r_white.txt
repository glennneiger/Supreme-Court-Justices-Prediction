justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
--
let’s
assume
that
--
either
assume
that
this
was
indian
country
or
not
or
that
it
was
a
non-indian
community
or
it
wasn’t.
let’s
assume
that
a
statute,
however
expressly
made
the
indian
tribal
liquor
laws
applicable
to
stores
on
this
piece
of
land.
now,
i
suppose
the
federal
law
would
govern
and
unless
it
was
unconstitutional,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
let’s
assume
that
the
very
statute
that
says
--
assume
that
federal
statute
said
the
indian
tribal
liquor
law
shall
apply
to
the
following
described
piece
of
property
and
described
this
piece
of
property
precisely.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
to
follow
whether
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
--
do
you
think
the
statute
which
might
otherwise
be
vague
or
nearly
vague
can
be
--
can
have
its
law
secured
by
construction
of
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
did,
strike
it
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn’t
have
it
construed
it
if
they
thought
it
was
vague.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
have
other
reason
besides
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you’d
be
making
this
argument,
your
argument,
even
if
there
were
no
subsection
(c)
of
1154?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
and
that
--
and
when
you
emphasized
that
your
state
gives
due
process
protection
to
before
denying
or
withdrawing
a
license
so
you
--
was
your
implication
that
the
tribal
people
do
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
that
really
means
to
also
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know
what
the
district
court’s
standard
was
in
judging
indian
community.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
you
look
at
11,
you
wouldn’t
know
or
understand
as
well.
even
if
you
look
at
it
all,
you
don’t
know
what
it
is.
