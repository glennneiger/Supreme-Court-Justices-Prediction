mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
yes,
your
honor,
i
appreciate
it
very
much.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
wyoming’s
interest
in
this
particular
case
on
our
--
our
inference’s
amicus
is
first
off
that
this
is
fee-patented
land
owned
by
a
non-indian
and
it’s
our
position
that
the
state
of
wyoming
has
so
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
this
liquor
license.
secondly
that
the
state
of
wyoming
provides
due
process
protections
in
the
issuance
of
a
liquor
license,
due
process
protection
and
the
renewal
of
a
liquor
license,
due
process
protection
on
the
revocation
or
suspension
of
a
liquor
license.
basically,
our
laws
pertaining
to
the
regulation
of
liquor
in
the
state
of
wyoming
protect
not
only
the
licensee
which
in
this
case
is
the
respondent
but
also
the
public.
and
we
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
indians
are
certainly
part
of
the
public
of
the
state
of
wyoming.
they’re
citizens
of
wyoming
and
of
the
united
states
that
we
provide
by
statutory
machinery
a
mechanism
wherein
the
members
of
the
reservation,
both
arapahoe
and
shoshone,
can
participate
in
the
statutory
procedures
relating
to
the
renewal
or
suspension
of
revocation
of
a
liquor
license.
we
feel
that
on
the
disestablishment
or
relinquishment
theory,
we
feel
that
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
1914
in
clairmont
v.
united
states
and
also
dick
v.
united
states,
about
the
same
time,
are
very
important
here.
we
think
that
these
two
cases
support
the
proposition
that
fee-patented
lands
owned
by
a
non-indian
is
not
subject
to
federal
control
or
indian
control.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
yes,
your
honor.
that
the
state
of
wyoming
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
this
liquor
license.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
my
implication
as
--
it
isn’t
very
clear.
the
ordinance
itself
is
arguable
under
section
in
revocation
or
suspension,
it’s
unclear
to
us
whether
or
not,
for
instance,
ten
days
notice
has
to
be
given
in
order
to
have
a
license
revoked
or
suspended.
it’s
also
unclear
just
whether
or
not
and
i
don’t
think
the
record
shows
us
or
shows
an
absence
of
this,
so
that
--
in
wyoming,
when
we
have
hearings
on
liquor
license
subject
to
the
wyoming
administrative
procedure
act
and
there’s
no
indication
in
the
--
in
ordinance
number
26,
that
for
instance,
respondent
mazurie
would
be
accorded
due
process
protection.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
he
was
after
--
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
well,
sir,
your
honor,
he
had
a
license
since
1969.
the
property,
the
deeded
land
had
been
selling
--
business
had
been
located
since
1954
and
what
happened
was
his
application
to
the
tribes
was
for
initial
license,
not
a
renewal
and
we
think
that
is
very
inequitable.
the
hearing
given
him
--
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
he
was
given
right
to
come
into
the
--
before
the
joint
tribal
council
and
the
record
show
that
he
isn’t
given
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses
the
record
as
in
wyoming.
it
doesn’t
show
that
tribes
have
adopted
any
type
of
rules
or
regulations
which
comport
with
due
process
and
protect
the
respondent.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
i
might
clarify
that.
that
hearing
was
held
before
the
county
commissioners.
the
county
commissioners
--
this
is
a
renewal,
your
honor.
they
decided
not
to
renew
the
license.
the
case
appealed
pursuant
to
one
of
our
statutes
to
district
court.
the
district
court
sent
it
back
for
the
reason
that
the
county
commissioners
have
an
adopted
rules
and
regulations
and
so
mazurie
is
operating
at
the
present.
the
case
is
on
limbo.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
manner
that
--
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
i
don’t
--
i
think
it
was
presented
but
i
don’t
know
how
much
--
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
no,
i
wasn’t
there,
sir.
all
i
can
read
is
from
the
record
but
my
point
is
your
honor
that
the
state
of
wyoming
has
an
interest
in
the
regulation
of
liquor
and
that
we
provide
a
due
process
procedure
for
the
issuance
of
other
application
of
license.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
the
difference
between
the
wyoming
--
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
well,
it’s
our
position
that
--
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
it’s
our
position
that
the
land
in
question
is
fee-patented
and
that
the
state
of
wyoming
had
so
an
exclosure
jurisdiction
over
that
liquor
license.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
yes.
that’s
our
point.
i
would
like
to
say,
that
it’s
been
an
honor
for
me
today
to
present
my
--
the
state’s
position
on
this
case
to
this
body.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jerome
f.
statkus
thank
you.
