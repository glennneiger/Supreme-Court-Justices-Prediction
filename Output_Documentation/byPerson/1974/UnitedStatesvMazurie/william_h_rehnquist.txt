1154
(c)
provides
that
the
term
indian
country
as
used
in
the
section
does
not
include
fee-patented
lands
in
non-indian
community
and
the
district
court
finds
that
this
took
place
in
indian
country,
he
is
negating
the
application
of
that
exception,
isn’t
he?
justice
william

rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william

rehnquist
but
he
doesn’t
have
to.
all
he
has
to
do
is
take
that
definition
--
this
is
excluded
from
indian
country
and
he
says,
nonetheless,
this
took
place
in
indian
country.
he
negates
the
application
of
the
exception.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
the
respondents
are
non-indians
who
are
prosecuted
for
operating
a
bar
on
private
land
within
an
indian
reservation
without
having
obtained
a
tribal
permit
which
is
required
by
federal
law.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
their
convictions
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
defining
the
offense
was
so
vague
that
its
enforcement
would
violate
due
process.
and
on
the
additional
grounds
that
even
if
congress
had
the
authority
to
regulate
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
on
privately
owned
land
within
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation,
it
could
not
delegate
this
authority
to
an
indian
tribe.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
the
statute
is
sufficiently
clear
and
definite
so
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
the
respondents
were
fairly
warned
that
their
conduct
was
proscribed.
as
for
the
question
of
federal
power
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
non-indians
on
non-indian
land
that
is
within
a
reservation's
boundaries,
our
cases
have
long
established
that
congress'
plenary
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
indian
tribes
is
adequate
to
control
all
traffic
and
alcoholic
beverages
with
tribal
indians.
we
also
conclude
that
congress'
delegation
of
a
portion
of
this
power
was
valid.
the
court
of
appeals
we
believe
incorrectly
characterized
the
tribes
to
which
this
authority
was
delegated
as
being
mere
private
voluntary
organizations.
rather,
our
cases
have
said
that
they
are
unique
entities
which
possess
attributes
of
sovereignty
and
are
historically
empowered
to
exercise
authority
over
matters
relating
to
their
internal
order
and
relations.
under
these
cases,
these
facts
are
sufficient
to
protect
congress'
decision
that
they
should
be
empowered
to
control
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
on
their
reservation.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
is
therefore
reversed.
