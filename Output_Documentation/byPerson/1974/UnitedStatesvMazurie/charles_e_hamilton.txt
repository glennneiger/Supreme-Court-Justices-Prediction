mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
live
in
riverton,
wyoming
and
we
are
centered
approximately
in
the
center
of
the
wind
river
indian
reservation
which
is
a
reservation
made
up
of
the
shoshone
and
arapahoe
tribes
and
which
has,
i’m
sure
you
are
aware
constitutes
considerably
over
two
million
acres.
the
history
of
this
reservation
has
been
varied
and
sundry
with
a
considerable
amount
of
land
being
removed
from
the
reservation
by
the
federal
government
all
of
that
north
of
the
wind
river
and
they
then
started
distinguishing
the
cases
based
on
what
was
south
of
the
wind
river
which
is
the
area
which
we
have
which
they
call
the
portion
of
that
which
had
not
been
taken
away.
now,
the
basis
for
the
patent
in
this
case
which
was
rendered
to
my
class
predecessor
in
title
was
34
stat.
182
which
states
among
other
things
that
the
united
states
government
upon
the
issuance
of
that
patent
without
restriction
thus
thereby
relinquished
all
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
portion
of
land.
so
then,
who
has
jurisdiction
over
that
land
and
that
is
taken
up
immediately
by
article
xxi,
section
26
of
the
wyoming
constitution
which
says
that
the
minute
a
patent
is
issued
that
the
--
excuse
me
--
that
the
land
becomes
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
wyoming.
now,
mr.
mazurie
and
the
blue
bull
inc.
are
both
legal
citizens
of
the
state
of
wyoming.
they
are
then
subject
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
dual
citizenship,
that
of
being
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
as
being
citizens
of
the
state
of
wyoming.
enrolled
members
of
the
shoshone
and
arapahoe
tribe,
on
the
other
hand,
are
the
beneficiaries
of
three
levels
of
citizenship,
those
of
being
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
the
state
of
wyoming,
and
of
the
shoshone
and/or
arapahoe
tribe.
this
is
a
very
exclusive
club,
and
a
very
exclusive
group.
you
cannot
belong
unless
you
have
25%
indian
blood
on
your
father
side.
now,
there
are
many
people
on
that
reservation
who
have
an
excess
of
50%
indian
blood
but
who
were
born
out
of
wedlock,
things
of
that
sort.
these
people
are
not
eligible
for
tribal
membership.
you
have
to
pass
all
of
the
rules
and
regulations.
you
have
to
be
approved
by
the
tribal
council
before
you
can
even
belong
to
it.
there
a
few
more
than
4000
total
enrolled
indians
on
the
reservation.
there
are
25,000
people
who
lived
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
that
reservation.
obviously,
the
majority
of
the
people
who
are
there
and
who
are
affected
by
any
rules
and
regulations
of
the
tribal
council
are
non-indians.
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
i
don’t
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
i
don’t
--
the
conversation
has
been
all
the
way
through
this
matter.
all
three
levels
of
course
including
here
today,
your
honor.
that
we
are
talking
about
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
self-determination,
to
self-government
as
opposed
to
non-indians
who
i
guess
is
everyone
else.
now,
just
because
you
don’t
belong
to
the
club
does
not
make
you
a
non-indian,
i
guess
it
does,
i
don’t
know.
that’s
one
of
the
problems
that
i’m
having
with
1154
(c)
because
if
i
can’t
tell
who
the
players
are
in
the
game,
then
it’s
pretty
--
or
what
the
rules
or
what
kind
of
a
ball
is
in
play,
then
i’ll
have
a
tough
time
measuring
out
the
field.
so,
what
we’ve
been
up
against
in
this
case
is
trying
to
determine
just
what
1154
(c)
means.
does
it
mean
that
the
community
must
be
predominantly
enrolled
indians?
does
it
mean
that
the
community
must
be
predominantly
people
of
a
certain
percentage
of
indian
blood
and
if
so
what?
does
it
mean
that
they
must
go
to
an
indian
school
or
that
they
must
speak
some
indian
dialect?
that
they
have
a
certain
color
of
skin?
that
they
shave
or
don’t
shave?
what
--
where
is
the
criteria?
there
isn’t
any
which
anyone
can
reasonably
understand.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir,
that’s
true.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
so
far
as
enrollment
is
concerned.
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
but
the
shoshone
and
arapahoe
tribes
and
i
had
considerable
problems
practicing
law
up
there
over
the
past
years
in
trying
to
go
to
the
tribal
council
with
people
that
i
felt
in
my
opinion
were
qualified
to
be
enrolled
and
have
them
summarily
dismiss
me
and
say,
“we
don’t
want
to
listen
to
you
mr.
hamilton”
and
of
course,
there’s
no
appeal,
of
course.
and
so,
these
people
were
not
enrolled.
and
it’s
kind
of
a
--
it’s
kind
of
a
personality
thing
up
there
and
it’s
a
very
difficult
thing
to
deal
with.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
so
far
as
the
criteria
for
admittance
into
the
club,
no
sir.
he
would
not.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
i
don’t
know.
in
other
words,
it
says
that
if
you
can
--
if
the
government
can
prove
and
please
understand
it’s
not
a
matter
of
affirmative
defense
on
our
part.
this
is
a
criminal
case.
and
i
differ
with
my
respective
colleague
here
who
argued
that
we
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
we
were
in
a
non-indian
community.
we
have
the
burden
of
proving
nothing
because
we
were
the
defendants
in
a
criminal
case.
but
the
goal
is
it
is
a
burden
of
the
government
to
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
in
this
matter
and
in
all
matters.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir
but
that’s
not
in
a
particular
statutory
procedure
which
allows
--
which
first
of
all
gives
a
defendant
the
choice
about
whether
or
not
to
plead
that
defense
and
if
so,
then
he
is
subjected
to
the
following
conditions.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
case
here
says
that
the
government
has
the
duty
of
proving
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt:
one,
that
you
sold
liquor,
which
we
admit;
two,
that
you
are
located
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
a
reservation
which
we
admit;
third,
that
you
are
not
in
a
--
that
you
are
not
located
in
a
non-indian
community.
they
did
not
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
one
of
the
elements
of
this
crime,
which
is
that
we
were
not
located
in
a
non-indian
community.
you
see
what’s
wrong
with
the
statute
is
it
has
a
double
negative
in
it
which
makes
it
very
to
understand
in
the
beginning.
but
the
united
states
did
not
prove
anything
in
that
regard.
it
was
completely
up
for
grabs.
nobody
knew
when
we
walked
out
of
the
district
courtroom
in
cheyenne
what
was
going
on.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
your
honor,
i
had
a
map
of
that
reservation
which
is
a
list
of
an
exhibit
in
this
case
and
which
was
about
10
feet
by
15
feet
square
and
i
spread
it
and
i
went
and
took
a
red
pencil
and
marked
off
every
piece
of
deeded
land
on
that
reservation.
it
took
two-and-half
days
with
two
people
and
a
red
pencil
to
do
it.
that’s
how
much
there
is.
and
that
map
was
in
exhibit
and
fort
washakie
was
placed
there
and
the
land
around
fort
washakie
is
in
fact
about
right
in
that
area
is
about
50%
red.
so,
i
kept
asking
both
chiefs,
in
other
words,
both
chairman
of
the
respective
tribal
councils,
the
arapahoes
and
the
shoshones.
i
said,
“where
is
the
boundary
line
between
the
community
and
the
country?”
they
didn’t
know.
“where
is
the
--
is
this
place
in
the
community?”
i
asked
mr.
hobbs
who
has
been
the
superintendent
of
the
reservation
works
for
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
since
1961.
i
said,
“mr.
hobbs,
you
are
at
the
administrator
of
this
reservation,
where
are
the
boundary
lines?”
“i
don’t
know.”
i
say,
“well,
is
this
a
non-indian
community?"
there
just
wasn’t
any
burden
of
proof
met
at
all.
okay.
so,
let’s
assume
that
--
and
based
on
this
and
on
these
facts,
the
tenth
circuit
said,
“we’re
sorry,
we
just
cannot,
you
know,
uphold
this
conviction.
you
just
totally
failed
in
your
burden
of
proof.”
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor
that
was
stipulated.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir,
it’s
fee-patented
land
without
any
reservation
at
all
except
the
usual
reservation
in
that
part
of
the
country
as
to
irrigation
ditches
and
things
of
that
constructed
by
the
government.
you
see,
the
problem
with
wyoming,
at
least
the
problem
to
many
of
the
wyoming
residents
is
that
48%
of
the
state
belongs
to
the
federal
government.
sometimes
it’s
a
little
difficult
for
the
wyoming
residents
to
live
in
harmony
with
the
big
brother,
so
to
speak,
because
of
the
large,
large
government
ownership
in
the
state.
now,
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
your
honor,
under
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
statute,
the
sale
of
alcohol
and
traffic
in
alcohol
with
indians
is
allowed,
generally.
in
other
words,
the
1953
statute
said
because
of
the
racial
discrimination
involved
by
not
allowing
the
indian
people
to
drink,
we
hereby
will
allow
them
to
drink.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
provided
they
agreed
to
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
their
reservation.
alright
sir.
so,
in
1954,
they
agreed
to
it
in
this
reservation.
then
along
came
1153
or
1154-c
in
1949
and
they
said,
and
the
congress
then
said
that
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
so
many
little
towns
on
these
reservations,
which
have
liquor
outlets
now,
we
assume
that
that
section
should
be
made
for
them.
now,
there
is
another
liquor
outlet.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
your
honor,
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
they
didn’t
prove
anything.
this
bar
as
we
prove
that
this
bar
is
located
on
a
county
right
of
way.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
within
the
huge
boundary
lines,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
your
honor,
i
don’t
have
any
burden,
it’s
a
criminal
case.
that’s
what
i’m
saying
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir
and
this
does
not
happen
to
be
one
of
them.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
statute
which
requires
this
criminal
--
this
as
set
out
as
an
affirmative
criminal
defense
such
as
insanity.
but
as
you
know
--
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes.
alright.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that’s
the
only
place
and
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
guidelines
or
definitions
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that’s
correct.
and
to
think
about
it
is
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
to
prove
that
this
is
not
a
non-indian
community.
there’s
a
double
negative
again.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
or
they
must
--
it’s
an
element
of
the
crime
for
them
to
prove
that
it
is
an
indian
community
because
of
the
exception
in
the
law.
now,
i
will
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
my
client
was
prosecuted
under
section
1154
which
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no,
your
honor.
we
admitted
that
it
was
then
an
indian
country
because
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
because
it
is
under
115
--
under
the
definition
of
section
1151.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
you
can
be
an
indian
country
and
be
on
a
non-indian
community.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
but
well
--
but
that
presents
a
problem
and
that
the
southern
part
of
riverton
is
predominantly
within
the
indian
and
mexican
people.
they
live
down
on
one
side
of
town.
now,
is
part
of
non-indian
community
an
indian
community?
where’s
your
guideline?
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
certainly.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
and
what’s
an
indian
or
what’s
a
non-indian?
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
who
tells
us
that?
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
because
he
did
not
make
any
finding
as
to
the
community.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
i
don’t
believe
he
does
sir.
i
believe
that
he
also
asked
to
make
a
specific
finding
as
to
the
concept
of
the
indian
community
because
of
the
physical
location
of
this
establishment.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
your
honor,
the
proof
was
as
to
the
number
of
indian
children
enrolled.
now,
were
these
in
the
school?
were
these
enrolled
indian
children?
they
didn’t
know.
is
enrolling
in
the
tribes
the
criteria?
no
one
knows.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
your
honor,
we
don’t
know
what
an
indian
family
is.
does
that
mean
that
each
member
of
the
family
is
an
enrolled
indian
in
one
of
these
two
tribes?
i
don’t
know.
there
are
no
guidelines.
there
is
no
criterion
as
to
what
is
an
indian
and
what
is
non-indian.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
often
this
happens.
are
those
indians
or
non-indians
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned?
we
don’t
know.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that’s
correct,
your
honor
but
what
i’m
saying
is
i
don’t
know
how
determine
or
what
is
not
a
non-indian
community
because
i
don’t
know
what
a
non-indian
is.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
because
here’s
the
thing,
this
probably,
you
know,
this
is
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
you
have
to
probably
make
rules
for
all
of
the
indian
tribes
here.
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
important
case
and
the
thing
about
it
is
maybe,
we
would
adopt
in
wyoming
what
is
the
standing
of
the
tribes
in
wyoming.
maybe
in
south
dakota,
you
would
have
the,
whatever
the
standard
sets
up
for
membership
in
the
tribes
there.
all
others
being
non-indians.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
the
federal
law
governs
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
alright.
then
of
course,
you
have
no
problem
because
anybody
can
determine
what
the
jurisdiction
is.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that
is
true
especially
--
especially
when
you
have
a
federal
statute
which
says
what
conveyed
a
property
out
in
fee
simple
without
reservation
or
restriction
that
then
it
goes
to
the
states
under
the
state
jurisdiction.
and
that
what
happens
to
the
piece
of
land
to
my
client
sets
off.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir
and
it’s
--
and
if
you
relate
34
stat.
182
to
article
xxi,
section
26,
the
wyoming
constitution,
the
two
dovetails
just
like
that.
the
minute
that
--
the
minute
that
patent
is
issued
without
reservation
or
restriction,
then
you
are
under
the
--
then
you
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
state
of
wyoming.
you
enjoy
all
the
benefits
and
rights
of
citizenship,
you
enjoy
all
of
the
benefits
and
rights
of
the
court
system,
the
appellate
system,
the
franchise
system,
everything.
you
have
everything
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
constitution
and
wyoming
constitution.
but
if
you’re
on
an
indian
jurisdiction,
you
don’t.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
you
would
have
to
go
through
the
tribal
rules
at
fort
washakie.
it
would
be
a
monumental
judge.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no,
sir.
it
does
not
because
these
people
are
struggling
over
three
million
acres.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no
sir,
there
is
only
one
incorporated
municipality
in
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reservation
and
that
is
the
city
of
riverton.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
there
are
other
small
communities
out
around
but
just
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
your
honor,
that’s
not
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
that
might
be
his
interpretation
but
i
don’t
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
but
it’s
my
--
but
it’s
my
understanding
at
this
time
that
on
certain
reservations,
the
indians
have
been
asked
to
incorporate
their
communities
and
they
have
refused
suggesting
that
then,
they
would
be
removed
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
your
honor,
it’s
a
difficult
thing
to
do
in
that
area.
people
are
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
it
was
--
it
was
a
land
grant
in
1906
and
it
was
kind
of
like
the
--
kind
of
like
oklahoma
land
rush.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
they
are
indian,
your
honor
but
i
don’t
know
what.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
i
don’t
know
what
an
indian
means.
you
see,
that’s
still
the
problem.
there
wasn’t
--
there
wasn’t
any
questions
asked
and
i
couldn’t
find
out
how
many
of
them
were
in
fact
enrolled
indians.
they
didn’t
know.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir,
whatever
that
might
be.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
which
brief
your
honor,
there
has
been
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor
but
the
thing
about
it
is
indian
families
is
a
questionable
statement.
i
don’t
know
what
--
what
the
criteria
is
to
determine
whether
--
what
those
people
are.
i
do
know
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
i
know
it
doesn’t,
your
honor.
and
it
also
doesn’t
say
what
an
indian
community
is.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
or
what
it
not
--
what
it
is
not.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor.
it’s
a
two-pronged
attack.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
possible
way
they
could
make
their
proof
under
that
statute,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
the
only
incorporated
town
within
the
exterior
boundaries
where
the
reservation
is
riverton.
now,
whether
it’s
a
non-indian
community
or
not,
i
have
no
idea
or
whether
a
part
of
it.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
so
far
as
that
--
so
far
as
that
statute
is
concerned,
i
have
no
idea.
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
i
think
it
is
of
a
questionable
area
where,
you
know,
people
of
intelligence
can
differ.
and
if
so,
then
it’s
not
a
proper
statute
for
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
well,
your
honor,
if
it
can’t
have
its
law
secured
by
construction
then
it
better
be
stricken
down
and
replaced
by
the
congress.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
they
did.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
i
think
they
felt
that
the
evils
here
were
not
--
did
not
justify
that
due
to
the
fact
that
they
felt
that
in
spite
of
this
statute
that
the
indians
and
the
tribal
councils
had
no
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
you
know,
on
deeded
land
with
any
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
a
mayor?
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no,
sir.
we
just
got
to
know
it
last
week
and
he’s
not.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
at
this
time,
no
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
i
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
it’s
not
predominantly
indian
people,
no.
but
there
is
a
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no
sir,
i
don’t
know
what
the
standard
is.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes
sir,
many.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
no
sir,
they
get
it
from
the
state.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
not
yet.
not
since
the
tenth
circuit
court,
this
is
the
test
case.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
it’s
a
test
case
for
that
reservation,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
because
there
--
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
that
is
assumed,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
sir.
the
issue
never
arose.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
the
city
ordinance
26
changed
this
in
1971.
mr.
charles
e.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor
but
they
straightened
the
road
out,
i’m
happy
--
i’m
happy
to
inform
you.
so,
it’s
not
quite
as
hazardous
as
it
used
to
be.
thank
you.
