chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1018,
united
states
against
mazurie.
mr.
sachse,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
proceed
for
a
minute,
mr.
sachse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
develop
that
after
lunch
if
you
wish.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
sachse,
you
--
you
have
about
eight
minutes
left
altogether.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fine,
we
may
have
the
questions
later.
mr.
hamilton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
non-indians
technically,
in
the
sense
you
were
just
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
including
whites
and
the
marginal
group
who
can’t
get
into
the
club?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
how
did
they
offer
that
proof
in
that
respect
by
maps
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
answered
that
this
an
essential
element
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
the
district
court
made
no
finding
beyond
what
you
had
already
stipulated
to
namely
that
you
were
in
an
indian
country.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
your
position
is
he
had
to
go
beyond
that
and
take
the
second
leg
of
subsection
(c)
and
make
an
explicit
finding
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
do
that,
he’d
have
to
define
what
is
an
indian,
wouldn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would
--
hypothetically,
would
he
have
to
say
an
indian
includes
not
only
indians
enrolled
in
the
two
tribes,
either
one
of
the
two
tribes
or
any
person
having
any
degree
of
indian
blood
and
then
count
of
how
many
there
were?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
wyoming
jurisdiction,
you’re
saying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
or
could
we
spell
out
from
this
record
in
any
way,
how
many
of
the
people
in
the
area
where
your
establishment
is
located
in
this
community
are
enrolled
members
of
one
of
these
tribes?
or
are
none
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
answer
is
that
this
record
doesn’t
show
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
your
position
is
that
it
would
be
an
essential
part
of
the
government’s
burden
in
this
case
to
establish
that
fact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
your
attack
in
this
respect
go
to
the
defects
of
the
statute
that
the
statute
is
the
statute
under
which
no
crime
can
be
established?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apart
from
the
proof.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
statute,
you
said,
they
haven’t
made
their
proof
but
it
isn’t
a
good
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
seem
to
have
some
problems
here
that
your
colleague,
mr.
statkus
has
used
your
time
but
that
was
perhaps
partly
attributable
to
court.
we’ll
give
you
--
will
five
minutes
help
you
out
any?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
your
point
to
be
that
wyoming
doesn’t
have
to
share
the
powers
issue
of
liquor
licenses
with
anyone
including
the
united
states
of
america.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
it’s
a
very
short
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
sachse,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
ten
minutes
now,
to
clear
that
up.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
do
you
say
this
respondent
first
required
a
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
get
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
he
operating
for
the
meantime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
none.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
in
73-1018,
in
mazurie
--
united
states
against
mazurie
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
