subsection
(c)
says
an
absence
of
a
three-year
statute.
is
it
--
is
there
any
statute?
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
is
the
regulation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
here
being.
justice
william
o.
douglas
my
understanding
is
that
it
varies
from
tribe
to
tribe.
justice
william
o.
douglas
there’s
no
standard
federal
regulation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
quarter
’64.
justice
william
o.
douglas
except
for
the
subdivision
c,
is
there
any
reference,
as
many
references
to
indian
country?
is
there
anywhere
in
the
statute,
any
reference
except
in
c
to
non-indian
communities
or
even
to
an
indian
community?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it’s
the
only
place.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it’s
the
definition
of
indian
country
but
not
of
indian
communities
and
i
gather
the
district
court
found
that
this
was
indian
country
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
not
whether
or
not
it
was
an
indian
community
or
non-indian
community.
justice
william
o.
douglas
which
is
to
say
what,
to
prove
it
is
an
indian
community?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
hamilton.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
district
judge
found,
as
i
read
the
record,
that
the
land
was
an
indian
country.
is
it
your
position
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
sustain
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
position
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
must
be
an
indian
country
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
could
be
an
indian
country
and
not
a
non-indian
country.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don’t
think
that
was
implied
there
despite
the
proof
of
number
of
families,
the
number
of
indians
in
a
certain
square
mile
area,
the
fact
that
the
bar
was
out
there
by
itself.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
certainly,
the
presence
of
indian
families,
to
the
extent
of
what
--
244
out
260
or
something
like
this
is
must
some
tough
criterion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you
indicated
a
little
while
ago
that
eligible
indians
were
not
permitted
to
be
enrolled.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
indian
country
in
the
1153
act
is
used
in
the
same
sense
of
indian
country,
and
see
if
the
1949
act
by
definition
does
not
include
a
non-indian
community.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
is
--
is
your
client
faced
within
any
incorporated
municipality
of
any
kind?
justice
william
o.
douglas
which
you
promote
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
they
incorporated?
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
then
i
suppose
in
the
statute,
you
argued
that
community
could
well
mean
neighborhood,
whatever
that
is.
justice
william
o.
douglas
incidentally,
i
know
this
is
going
to
finding
11
that
fort
washakie
is
not
an
incorporated
non-indian
community
with
recognized
boundaries.
are
there
any
incorporated
non-indian
communities
with
recognized
boundaries?
justice
william
o.
douglas
can
you
have
it
unincorporated
non-indian
community?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
hamilton,
does
the
wind
river
canyons
too
was
beautiful
as
it
used
to
be
years
ago?
justice
william
o.
douglas
his
only
finding
as
i
recall
was
that
it
was
not
an
incorporated.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
might
have
been
on
the
premise
that
he
assumed
that
to
be
a
non-indian
community,
it
had
to
be
incorporated.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
say
that
--
all
of
you
have
to
prove
was
that
it
happened
in
indian
country.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
finding
17
is,
this
court
holds
that
are
those
said
defendants
operated
blue
bull
on
land
deeded
fee
such
land
is
an
indian
country
and
therefore
subject
to
federal
law
and
you
say
that’s
a
finding
which
excludes
non-indian
country
namely
non-indian
community.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
it’s
really
finding
17
rather
than
21,
isn’t
it?
or
at
least
the
two
together,
is
it?
