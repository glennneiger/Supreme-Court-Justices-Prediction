mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
to
review
a
decision
of
that
case
that
held
unconstitutional
18
u.s.c.
1154,
one
of
the
principal
laws
regulating
the
introduction
of
liquor
into
indian
reservations
and
18
u.s.c.
1161,
law
of
the
same
purpose.
in
doing
so,
it
reversed
the
district
court
which
had
convicted
the
defendants
in
this
case.
i
think
the
best
way
to
approach
this
case
is
first
with
an
analysis
of
these
statutes
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
with
the
exact
facts
of
this
case.
the
facts
will
make
sense
in
the
context
of
law.
the
problem
of
liquor
on
indian
reservations
has
been
a
serious
problem
to
indian
tribes
and
to
congress
for
a
long
time.
and
in
the
1800’s,
congress
absolutely
prohibited
the
introduction
of
liquor
into
indian
country
and
absolutely
prohibited
the
sale
of
liquor
to
indians
who
are
under
the
guardianship
of
the
united
states
no
matter
where
they
were.
this
remained
essentially
the
law
until
1949.
in
1949,
the
act
which
is
now
section
(c)
of
18
u.s.c.
1154,
that’s
on
page
3
of
our
brief,
was
passed.
that
section
redefined
indian
country.
you
know,
indian
country
has
been
defined
include
all
the
land
inside
an
indian
reservation.
that
act
redefined
indian
country
for
the
purposes
of
the
liquor
laws
to
exclude
rights
of
ways
through
reservations
and
non-indian
communities.
the
congress
in
making
that
amendment
which
was
just
part
of
a
general
set
of
amendments
to
18
u.s.c.
said
that
it
was
to
bring
the
statute
more
into
accord
with
the
way
the
statute
has
actually
been
enforced.
then,
the
practical
effect
of
it
of
course,
was
to
say
that
where
there
were
little
non-indian
communities
on
an
indian
reservation
that
liquor
could
be
sold
there
or
that
a
truck
passing
through
an
indian
reservation
couldn’t
be
stopped
because
it
was
carrying
liquor.
then
in
19
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there’s
nothing
in
the
treaty
in
no
particular
statute
that
would
apply
here.
there
could
be
a
treaty
that
would
say
nowhere
in
the
reservation
ever
or
something
like
that.
then
in
1953,
18
u.s.c.
1161
was
passed.
this
was
a
local
option
statute.
indian
people
had
felt
sometime
that
the
law
is
totally
prohibiting
introduction
of
liquor
into
indian
reservations
was
discriminatory
against
them
and
unnecessary.
and
congress
reacting
to
that
passed
a
very
limited
statute
that
said,
liquor
was
still
illegal
in
indian
country
as
defined
by
these
two
statutes
but
it
could
be
legally
introduced
if:
number
one,
it
did
not
violate
state
law
and
number
two,
the
tribe
passed
an
ordinance
allowing
it
to
be
introduced
and
that
ordinance
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
published
in
the
federal
register.
that
was
a
degree
of
control
over
the
introduction
into
indian
country
that
18
u.s.c.
1161
provided.
now,
facts
of
this
case,
the
wind
river
reservation
is
a
major
reservation
in
wyoming,
the
shoshone
and
arapahoe
tribes
are
there.
in
1953,
after
the
passage
of
this,
of
18
u.s.c.
1161,
they
took
advantage
of
the
new
act
and
passed
an
ordinance
saying
that
liquor
could
be
introduced
into
the
reservation
if
it
was
done
so
in
accordance
with
state
law.
after
that
ordinance
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
advertised
in
the
federal
register.
after
they
passed
that
ordinance,
the
predecessors
of
the
mazurie
has
bought
a
piece
of
property
on
the
reservation
and
opened
a
bar.
they
then
operated
that
bar
where
they
had
a
valid
state
liquor
license.
they
operated
the
bar
for
18
years
then
the
tribe
reconsidered
its
original
resolution,
decided
that
it
shouldn’t
have
the
reservation
be
wide
open.
it
passed
a
new
ordinance,
an
ordinance
--
ordinance
number
26
which
provided
that
to
introduce
liquor
into
the
reservation,
that
person
henceforth
would
have
to
obtain
a
tribal
license
as
well
as
the
state
license.
this
regulation
which
set
out
in
some
details,
the
information
that
had
to
be
supplied
to
the
tribe,
the
standards
for
obtaining
a
tribal
license,
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
it’s
a
regulation
that’s
pretty
much
like
any
municipality’s
regulation
on
liquor
license.
this
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
advertised
in
the
federal
register.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
regulation,
i’m
sorry
to
say,
it
was
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
it
is
in
the
record
and
it’s
also
here
but
it’s
in
the
record
of
the
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
mean,
it’s
in
--
i
have
a
copy
of
it
right
here
but
it’s
in
the
record
of
the
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it
was
introduced
at
the
trial
and
stipulated.
it
was
stipulated.
it
was
validly
adopted
regulation
and
the
publication
of
federal
register
was
also
introduced
at
the
trial.
the
regulation
allowed
an
existing
bar
to
continue
until
it
had
to
get
a
new
state
license
and
at
that
time
required
it
to
apply
for
the
tribal
license
as
well.
the
mazuries
did
not
apply
for
the
tribal
license.
they
were
notified
then
to
apply.
they
then
did
apply
for
the
tribal
license,
gave
the
information
that
was
required
and
a
public
hearing
was
set
up
by
the
tribal
counsel
to
hear
their
application.
at
that
hearing,
there
was
considerable
testimony.
this
is
in
the
record
also,
of
disorderliness
at
that
bar.
there
was
a
testimony
that
the
bar
was
near
a
housing
project
where
a
lot
of
old
people
lived
and
that
people
came
out
of
the
bar
at
late
night
making
all
sorts
of
noise.
there
was
a
testimony
that
there
have
been
summary
killings
on
the
reservation,
all
of
which
have
been
associated
with
the
use
of
alcohol
that
there
had
been
fights
in
this
particular
bar.
that
the
bar
had
been
selling
to
minors.
as
a
result
to
this,
the
tribe
refused
the
liquor
license
to
the
bar.
mazuries
then
closed
the
bar
for
a
period
of
several
weeks.
they
then
decided
to
reopen
it
in
defiance
of
the
action
of
the
tribe.
at
that
point,
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
think
the
record
shows
precisely
when
a
particular
incident
happened,
your
honor.
i’m
unable
to
determine
from
the
transcript
that
was
there
whether
these
things
occurred
for
the
last
few
days
or
earlier.
the
b.i.a
then
closed
the
bar
and
the
u.s.
attorney
brought
a
misdemeanor
charge
against
the
mazuries
under
18
u.s.c.
1154
for
operating
a
bar
in
an
indian
country
as
defined
in
that
statute
without
the
consent
of
the
tribe.
at
the
trial,
almost
everything
i’ve
said
up
to
now
was
stipulated.
stipulation
is
in
the
appendix.
the
trial
focused
on
the
question
of
whether
the
mazuries
could
claim
that
their
bar
was
in
a
non-indian
community
and
thus
was
accepted
from
the
tribal
regulation.
the
government
introduced
the
witnesses
on
this
point
and
the
testimony
was
quite
complete
on
this
question.
the
government
showed
that
the
bar
was
located
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
fort
washakie
which
is
an
unincorporated
village
which
is
the
headquarters
of
the
tribal
governments.
they
showed
that
there
had
been
a
housing
survey
made
a
year
or
so
previously
to
determine
the
condition
of
housing
in
that
area
and
that
it
showed,
and
the
man
who
made
the
survey
was
there,
testified
and
was
cross-examined,
that
within
a
20-square
mile
area
of
fort
washakie,
there
were
only
212
families
living
and
that
of
those
a
170
and
a
half
were
indian
families
and
that
41
and
a
half
were
non-indian
families
and
the
halves
were
one
mixed
family
that
lived
in
the
area.
they
counted
that
family
as
a
half
each
way.
the
government
also
brought
in
the
superintendent
of
the
school
district
there
and
there
was
a
state
school
supported
both
by
federal
funds
and
state
funds
open
to
all
the
children
who
lived
in
that
area
and
the
superintendent
testified
that
of
243
students
that
223
were
indian
and
the
school
was
two
and
one-half
miles
from
the
bar.
mr.
mazurie
himself
testified
that
“we
are
kind
of
out
there
by
ourselves,
you
know.”
he
also
testified
that
this
bar
served
both
indians
and
non-indians.
that
when
there
was
trouble,
if
it
was
trouble
with
indians
he’d
call
the
tribal
police;
and
if
there
was
trouble
with
non-indians
he’d
call
the
county
sheriff.
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
the
--
i
should
say
the
case
was
tried
before
a
judge
alone,
it
was
jury
waived.
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
the
district
judge
found
that
the
defendants
had
opened
the
bar
in
indian
country
in
violation
of
the
statute
and
implicit
in
that
finding,
of
course,
was
that
it
did
not
fit
in
the
exception
of
the
statute
if
a
bar
run
in
a
non-indian
community
because
that
was
the
real
point
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
term
non-indian
community
is
undefined
and
therefore
no
one
could
tell
whether
he
was
operating
a
non-indian
community.
therefore,
the
entire
statute,
18
u.s.c.
1154
which
prohibits
the
introduction
of
liquor
into
an
indian
country
is
unconstitutionally
vague
because
it
contains
this
exception.
the
court
went
on
to
say
even
if
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutionally
vague;
we
doubt
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
prohibit
sales
of
liquor
by
a
non-indian
on
land
that
he
owns
in
an
indian
reservation.
and
then
went
on
to
say,
but
even
if
congress
does
have
that
authority,
it’s
an
unconstitutional
delegation
of
that
authority
to
let
the
tribe
itself
make
the
decision.
even
under
the
limited
circumstances
of
this
statute
as
to
whether
liquor
can
be
sold
within
the
indian
country
in
its
reservation.
we
think,
as
you
know,
that
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
just
simply
dead
wrong.
that
first,
on
the
question
of
the
vagueness
of
the
statute,
certainly,
one
can
postulate
a
situation
in
which
it
might
be
difficult
to
tell
whether
one
is
in
an
indian
community
or
non-indian
community.
actually,
in
25,
26
years
of
application
of
the
statute
apparently
that
kind
of
problem
hasn’t
come
up
but
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case.
this
is
an
ordinary
criminal
case.
and
the
test
in
the
case
such
as
this
is
not
whether
one
can
find
vague
areas
but
whether
the
statute
was
vague
as
applied
to
these
defendants.
congress
meant
something
sensible
by
the
words
“non-indian
community”
and
there’s
no
sensible
definition
of
non-indian
community
that
could
include
a
bar
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
tribal
headquarters
in
an
area
with
one
of
the
highest
concentrations
of
indian
families
that
you
often
find
in
an
indian
reservation.
i
think
the
court’s
--
i
think
i
don’t
need
to
recite
to
the
court
its
test
in
the
united
state
versus
national
dairy
corporation
that
that
test
is
applicable
and
i
think
justice
holmes’
statement
in
the
wurzbach
case
quoted
recently
by
the
court
in
broderick
versus
oklahoma
is
also
quite
applicable.
that
if
there’s
any
difficulty
in
borderline
cases,
i
interpose,
there
would
be
time
enough
to
consider
it
when
raised
by
someone
whom
it
concerns.
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
mazuries
knew
they
needed
this
tribal
license,
they
only
opened
the
bar
after
the
tribe
that
passed
its
ordinance
and
that
as
far
as
they’re
concerned,
they
simply
don’t
have
standing
to
raise
what
might
be
some
borderline
question
in
some
other
case.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
authority
of
congress,
that’s
absolutely
clear
that
congress
had
totally
prohibited
sales
of
liquor
in
the
indian
reservations
before
it
modified
those
regulations
that
prohibition
covered
both
indian-owned
and
non-indian
owned
land.
the
constitutional
authority
for
this
is
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution
which
gives
the
congress
authority
over
trade
with
the
indians
and
this
court
flatly
held
years
ago
in
united
states
versus
perrin
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
regulate
the
sale
of
liquor
within
indian
country
whether
it’s
on
privately
held
or
publicly
held
land
and
perrin
is
not
the
only
case.
practically,
every
aspect
of
that
law
was
litigated
at
one
time
or
another
and
the
half-dozen
cases
on
page
15,
16
of
our
brief
that
support
this
point.
now,
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
don’t
sympathize
with
them
too
much
because
they
opened
the
business
on
an
indian
reservation
because
the
tribe
had
made
one
of
two
choices,
either
to
allow
or
not
to
allow,
or
to
--
the
introduction
of
liquor.
now,
they
knew
that
that
was
an
inexorable
choice
that
if
things
didn’t
work
out,
the
tribe
could
change
this
and
when
the
tribe
did
change
it,
that
they’d
have
to
apply
for
tribal
license
or
could
be
totally
prohibited
if
the
tribe
just
said
“no
liquor
on
the
reservation.”
so
they
went
in
to
make
profit
from
the
opening
of
this
reservation
to
sales
of
liquor
and
there’s
no
vested
interest
there
that
i
can
see.
and
i
should
point
out
that
subsequently,
the
state
also
denied
their
liquor
license.
this
didn’t
render
the
case
moot
because
they
had
already
been
convicted
of
the
federal
offense
but
the
state
also
whatever
reasons
felt
that
this
bar
shouldn’t
continue.
as
to
the
delegation
of
authority
proposition,
i
just
want
to
make
several
short
statements.
one
is
that
an
indian
tribe
is
a
governmental
unit
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
the
tribe
--
that
reservations
were
reserved,
is
the
area
where
the
tribe’s
governmental
authority
would
apply,
for
instance
in
the
mcclanahan
case
that
a
tribe
that
a
state
ordinarily
doesn’t
have
jurisdiction
inside
an
indian
reservation,
that
narrow
exceptions
have
been
drawn
in
matters
purely
affecting
non-indians
the
state
will
have
jurisdiction.
but
where
an
important
indian
interest
is
at
issue
and
the
sale
of
liquor
within
an
indian
reservation,
i
think
it’s
clearly
such
an
interest
that
the
tribe
does
have
a
certain
governmental
authority
and
there’s
quite
a
good
argument
that
could
be
made
that
even
without
any
statute
of
congress,
the
tribe
would
have
the
right
to
prohibit
the
sale
of
liquor
within
the
reservation.
and
i
refer
the
court
to
rather
old
cases
of
this
court
leading
one
of
which
is
morris
versus
hitchcock
which
is
stated
in
our
brief.
but
here,
we
don’t
have
to
get
into
the
more
difficult
question
of
a
tribe’s
general
authority
over
non-indians
who
live
on
the
reservation
because
congress
which
the
court
over
and
over
has
recognized
is
having
plenary
authority
in
this
area
has
specifically
granted
this
legislative
power
and
has
done
it
in
a
very
limited
and
restricted
way
with
full
account
for
the
interest
of
non-indians.
the
very
exception
that’s
attacked
for
non-indian
communities
recognizes
and
protects
a
non-indian
interest
here
and
the
requirement
that
the
regulation
be
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
--
makes
this
a
very
limited
delegation
of
authority
and
that
it
be
advertised
in
public
--
federal
register,
so
that
everyone
will
know
that
it’s
there.
and
i
point
out
that
this
court
has
stated
numerous
times
that
in
assuming
responsibility
for
the
indians,
i’m
thinking
here
particularly
of
the
mancari
case
which
the
court
decided
last
year.
but
it
relies
on
a
whole
line
of
cases
before
that
congress
necessarily
has
the
power
to
do
the
things
that
are
reasonably
necessary
to
perform
that
trust
responsibility
and
nothing
could
be
a
better
exercise
of
the
trust
responsibility
than
to
return
in
this
controlled
and
limited
way,
some
power
to
the
tribes
to
decide
whether
there’s
very
important
problem
to
the
tribes
is
to
be
handled
by
a
complete
prohibition
or
by
other
methods.
i
have
one
other
thing
i
want
to
say
before
i
sit
down
but
i
think
my
time
is
up
for
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
would
say
this
that
i
think
behind
the
tenth
court’s
opinion
as
a
proposition
that
an
indian
tribe
shouldn’t
ever
make
a
decision
that
affects
a
non-indian
and
that
the
idea
that
a
non-indian
has
to
submit
himself
to
the
tribe’s
jurisdiction
on
whether
to
open
a
bar
there
is
simply
some
way
on
non-indian
american,
on
white
american
or
something
like
that.
but
that
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
versus
lee
makes
it
clear
that
that’s
not
so
that
in
appropriate
limited
situations,
a
person
does
have
to
go
to
the
tribal
authorities.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
unless
the
court
has
some
question
on
what
i’ve
just
said,
i’ll
save
this
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
i
do.
i
think
i
have
eight
minutes
and
i
may
need
it
with
all
the
things
that
had
been
said
in
the
last
few
minutes.
to
start
with,
the
position
of
the
state
of
wyoming
is
nothing
less
than
that
this
court
should
reverse
seymour
versus
superintendent,
mattz
versus
arnett
and
repeal
18
u.s.c.
1151
and
should
have
find
fact
contrary
to
finding
of
fact
of
the
district
court.
it’s
clear
and
it
was
stipulated
in
this
case
that
first,
it’s
clear
that
federal
law
does
apply
to
non-indian
owned
land
inside
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation.
now,
to
get
to
mr.
hamilton’s
argument,
i
have
to
say
this.
when
i
first
started
practicing
law,
it
was
in
baton
rouge,
louisiana
and
one
of
the
first
cases
that
i
had
was
a
--
i
was
defending
against
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
somebody
told
me
that
the
best
defense
against
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
to
totally
confuse
the
court
and
they
then
will
think
the
problem
is
so
complicated
that
they
can’t
grant
the
summary
judgment.
and
i
think
mr.
hamilton
has
made
a
good
run
at
that
in
this
case.
we
have
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think.
i
think
i
can
do
it
because
that
was
exactly
what
the
trial
in
the
district
court
was
about.
and
what
mr.
hamilton
is
trying
to
do
is
to
establish
here
in
20
minutes
what
he
was
unable
to
establish
in
a
day
or
two
in
the
district
court.
because
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
now,
remember
it
was
stipulated
that
these
acts
occurred
within
the
indian
reservation
on
fee-patented
land.
everything
was
stipulated
except
the
question
about
the
non-indian
community
and
when
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
it
was
a
non-indian
community,
it
was
an
exception
under
--
it
was
not
indian
country
as
defined
by
18
u.s.c.
1154
and
the
court
held
in
finding
number
21
that
the
defendants
in
dispensing
intoxicants
from
the
blue
bull
absent
license
from
the
tribe
violated
section
1154
but
it
didn’t
it
violated
section
1151
which
is
the
broad
definition
of
indian
country
but
1154
which
has
the
exception
in
it
about
non-indian
communities
and
i
want
to
make
another
point
straight.
i
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
his
only
specific
finding
as
to
the
community
was
that
--
was
that
in
his
first
list
of
findings
was
that
fort
washakie
was
not
an
incorporated
non-indian
community.
but
then
his
final
finding
is
that
the
defendant
violated
18
u.s.c.
1154.
but
i
want
to
make
a
point
about
burden
of
proof
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
it
might
have
been
if
you
hadn’t
--
if
you
haven’t
read
the
testimony
that
was
before
the
district
court
but
before
--
the
district
court
had
solid
testimony
before
and
by
the
way,
the
question
about
who
is
enrolled
and
who
is
not
enrolled
was
fully
brought
out
in
the
district
court.
and
then
the
testimony
as
to
the
school
children,
it
was
testified
that
they
were
enrolled
members
of
the
tribe
and
the
testimony
as
to
the
indian
population,
it
was
discussed,
who
was
enrolled,
who
wasn’t
enrolled
and
the
figures
stand
up
one
way
or
the
other.
but
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
make
here
is
that
the
district
court
only
had
one
thing
to
decide
and
that
was
whether
this
occurred
in
a
non-indian
community.
and
there
was
simply
no
evidence
that
however
you
wanted
to
stretch
the
idea
of
non-indian
community
that
this
occurred
in
a
non-indian
community.
and
because
of
that,
the
court
held
that
1154
was
satisfied.
but
the
point
he’s
making
a
minute
ago
was
that
we
don’t
urge
a
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
here.
there
was
solid
testimony,
solid
evidence
in
the
finding
in
this
case
that
this
did
not
occur
in
a
non-indian
community
and
a
lot
of
the
confusion
in
the
district
court
was
mr.
hamilton’s
continued
attempt
there
as
finally
got
around
into
doing
here.
to
try
to
say
that
the
government
had
to
prove
that
it
occurred
in
an
incorporated
indian
community
but
that’s
not
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
right.
and
indian
country
is
every
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
right
and
that’s
why
this
is
as
to
1154
which
defines
the
indian
country
with
that
exception
in
it
and
not
as
to
1151
and
when
you
read
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
think
21
makes
it
clearer.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
we
know
that
the
district
court
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
what
we
know
is
that
under
broad
or
a
narrow
standard.
this
was
not
an
indian
community.
and
that
under
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
excuse
me,
not
a
non-indian
community
and
the
question
was
whether
it
was
a
non-indian
community
and
applying
the
national
dairy
approach
to
this
--
to
this
case,
this
statute
is
clear
enough
and
i
think
in
operation,
it
has
been
clear
enough
that
this
statute
has
been
there
since
1949.
there’s
been
no
attempt
to
enforce
it
in
say
riverton.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
know.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
recall.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
he
required
a
license
--
well,
he
first
required
a
license
after
the
tribe
passed
an
ordinance
in
the
tribal
license
in
1953
providing
for
tribal
license.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
he
couldn’t
--
no,
he
was
denied
a
tribal
license.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
he
--
when
he
was
denied
a
tribal
license,
he
closed
down
for
a
while,
he
then
went
to
his
lawyer
and
he
then
decided
to
open
up
and
contest
it.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir,
excuse
me,
did
i
say
50?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i’m
sorry,
i
mean
19
--
1973.
he
first
was
able
to
open
his
bar
in
the
first
place
not
because
of
a
tribal
license
but
because
with
tribal
blanket
authorization.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
was
back
in
1953.
does
the
court
have
any
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
thank
you.
