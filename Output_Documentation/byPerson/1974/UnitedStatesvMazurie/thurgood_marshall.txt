i’m
still
worried
about
this
burden
of
proof.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
are
you
sure
it’s
on
the
government
to
show
that
this
is
on
the
excluded
territory?
that
it’s
not
in
the
excluded
territory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
providing
they
agreed
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
is
the
burden
on
them
to
prove
the
absence
of
exception
rather
than
your
burden
to
prove
that
you’re
within
the
exception?
justice
thurgood
marshall
within
the
big
boundary
lines?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
prove
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
they
proved
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
that
it
did
say
that
nobody
to
prove
whether
it’s
in
the
exception
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that,
if
your
burden
is
to
show
that
it’s
within
the
exception,
you
lose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know
of
several
criminal
defenses
that
are
affirmative
defenses.
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless
you
call
that
an
exception.
and
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
exception?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
riverton?
riverton
had
a
mayor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
council?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
indians?
or
is
it
only
the
mayor
who’s
indian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
anybody
in
the
council
an
indian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don’t
know
whether
or
not
that’s
an
indian
reservation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
know
whether
it’s
non-indian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said,
you
couldn’t
tell
whether
it
was
non-indian
or
not
but
now
you
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
case,
he
was
given
the
hearing
or
full
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
given
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
gave
him
a
hand
too,
didn’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
this
denial
of
hearing
before
had
argued
before
at
the
lower
court?
this
is
a
criminal
case,
if
i
understand
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you’re
arguing,
was
it
presented
to
the
court
below?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
truth
is
you
weren’t
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
denied
that
under
this
statute?
did
wyoming
deny
that
under
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
wyoming
denied
that
under
the
statute?
the
answer
is
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
complaining
about?
