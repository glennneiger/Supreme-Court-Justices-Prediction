mr.
sachse,
did
all
of
these
untoward
incidents
happen
during
the
18-year
period
or
just
toward
the
end
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn’t
--
don’t
findings
of
fact
number
10
and
number
11
in
the
district
court’s
judgment
indicate
at
least
his
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
a
non-indian
community
particularly
number
11.
it’s
not
an
incorporated
non-indian
community
with
recognized
boundaries.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
know
what
the
statute
says
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
you
said
the
statute
is
too
vague
to
understand
but
at
least
this
--
the
district
court
seemed
to
understand
it
in
these
terms.
now
with
incorporated
non-indian
community
would
recognize
boundaries.
finding

on

of

i’m
sorry,
of
the
(voice

brief,
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
at
this
time.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you’re
talking
about
indians
incorporating.
this
is
non-indian
community
with
recognized
boundaries.
justice
potter
stewart
riverton
is
incorporated,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
finding
number
10,
it’s
two-and-half
miles
from
the
--
from
the
reservation
public
school
and
we
know
from
the
evidence
introduced
that
a
vast
majority
of
the
students
or
the
pupils
of
that
school
are
indians.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
seem
to
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn’t
say
--
tribal
members
that
say
non-indian
community.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
you
--
there
was
video
of

introduced
on
this,
wasn’t
there.
that’s
correctly
summarized
on

of
the

the

brief.
brief
for
the
united
states
filed
august
15th
of
this
year.
this
is
the
first
three
or
four
sentences.
you’re
familiar
with
it,
i’m
sure,
212
families
of
which
170
and
a
half
are
indian
families,
the
remainder
are
non-indian
families.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
neither
the
statute
--
the
statute
doesn’t
say
anything
about
tribal
members.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
more
practically,
are
there
bars
in
riverton?
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
they
get
licenses
from
the
indian
reservation,
from
the
indian
tribe?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
any
of
them
who
have
been
ever
prosecuted
for
not
getting
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn’t
a
test
case
for
riverton,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
from
your
answer
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
have
been
clear
to
everybody
up
to
now
that
riverton
is
a
non-indian
community.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
somebody
that
you
deem
worthy
of
a
license
should
have
--
in
your
state
should
have
a
license?
justice
potter
stewart
and
should
not
be
deprived
of
it
by
an
indian
tribe?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he’s
a
non-indian
operating
on
his
own
fee-patented
land?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
a
non-indian
community.
