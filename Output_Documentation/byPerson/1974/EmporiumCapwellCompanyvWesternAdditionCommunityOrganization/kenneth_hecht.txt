mr.
kenneth
hecht
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
starting
on
my
own
presentation,
i
would
like
to
respond
briefly
to
some
of
the
points
that
preceding
counsel
had
made
and
some
of
the
questions
which
have
been
asked
by
the
court.
let
me
take
them
in
reverse
order.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
jefferson
standard
question
is
not
here
before
the
court
at
this
time.
that
was
the
issue
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
to
the
board
to
determine
whether
there
had
been
such
a
display
of
disloyalty
that
the
employees
ought
not
to
be
rehired,
but
the
court
recognized
that
the
trial
examiner
who
wrote
the
decision
which
the
board
adopted,
while
he
had
made
extensive
findings
of
fact,
had
declined
to
rule
on
the
issue
and
on
that
basis,
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
rule
on
it
either.
i
think
it's
not
been
raised
in
the
petitions
for
certiorari,
and
it
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
i
trust
from
my
briefs
that
it's
clear
that
we
are
not
here
advocating
collective
bargaining
according
to
race.
it's
quite
the
opposite.
it's
the
purpose
of
our
position
to
encourage
unions
and
management
to
be
more
responsive
to
the
problems
of
minorities
and
to
solve
those
problems
within
the
framework
of
collective
bargaining.
courts
have
said,
we
think
it's
correct,
that
there
cannot
be
strong
concerted
union
activity
so
long
as
the
employees
are
divided.
that
would
be
the
case
if
the
union
had
no
responsibility,
if
the
employer
had
no
responsibility.
we
think
what
we
are
urging
upon
the
court
is
a
method
by
which
minorities
can
be
accommodated
by
which
statutes
can
be
accommodated
so
that
industrial
peace
will
continue.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
if
the
women
engaged
in
their
concerted
activities
on
a
good
faith
of
belief
as
the
court
found,
if
the
women
had
attempted
to
go
through
the
union,
for
seven
months,
hollins
and
hawkins
tried
very
hard
to
use
the
processes
which
the
union
controlled;
that
is
to
say
the
grievance
process.
it
proved
to
be
a
futile
attempt
and
at
that
point
reluctantly
hollins
and
hawkins
with
the
advice
of
the
union
that
what
they
intended
to
do
was
not
unlawful,
did
not
violate
the
terms
of
the
contract
abandoned
the
union.
if
the
women
had
the
strong
statistical
support
for
their
claims
that
we
knew
it
was
a
good
faith
claim,
then
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
we
would
make
exactly
the
same
position.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
mr.
justice
burger,
if
all
of
the
facts
which
i've
listed
before
were
present,
if
there
were
discrimination
and
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
employer
was
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race
for
instance,
or
religion
as
you
have
suggested,
yes,
our
answer
would
be
the
same,
we
think
that's
what
the
law
requires.
i
think
it
important
to
remind
the
court
that
this
case
involves
a
discharge.
it
does
not
involve
a
refusal
to
bargain.
no
one
has
made
that
charge.
it's
really
not
before
the
court.
what
is
before
the
court
is
the
employer's
ability
to
fire
these
two
employees
for
having
engaged
in
the
concerted
activity
in
which
they
engaged.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
not
at
all
your
honor.
we've
not
argued
the
jefferson
standard
issue
in
our
brief
to
this
court
because
we
didn't
believe
it
was
appropriate.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
we
think
that
title
vii
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
it
does
not
make
a
difference.
it
makes
it
crystal
clear,
but
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
itself
prohibits
discrimination
in
employment
and
protects
concerted
activity
of
employees.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
absolutely,
absence
of
title
vii.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
it
is
not
absent
the
racial
factor.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
let
me
try
to
break
the
question
down
for
a
minute
if
i
can.
in
this
case,
we've
alleged
that
what
the
employees
have
done
was
to
seek
parity,
that
is
to
say
they
have
sought
what
the
contract
as
well
as
statute
requires.
there
is
a
nondiscrimination
clause
in
the
contract.
the
employees
here
sought
to
implement
that
provision,
that
was
their
purpose.
we've
also
argued
that
picketing
is
not
involved
here.
while
the
board
and
the
court
did
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
employees
had
picketed
and
there
is
no
sense
trying
to
hide
that,
the
facts
also
show
that
what
the
employees
did
was
to
distribute
handbills;
there
is
no
sense
hiding
that
either.
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
facts
and
to
draw
the
proper
legal
conclusion
based
on
those
facts,
and
the
facts
are
simply
not
in
dispute.
there
is
no
factual
allegation
in
the
record.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
these
employees
moved
with
signs
or
placards.
the
court
has
found
that
picketing
is
very
different
from
leafleting
and
that
there's
an
element
often
of
coercion
stated
or
unstated
to
picketing,
but
that's
not
present
here.
the
employees
were
stationary.
they
distributed
pieces
of
paper
with
printing
on
it.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
they
were
not
stationed
in
the
doorway,
your
honor.
they
were
stationed
near
the
doorway,
but
the
record
is
also
clear
that
there
was
no
harassment,
no
violence,
no
incitement
to
violence,
no
obstruction
of
customers.
there
wasn't
even
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
well,
the
people
who
were
distributing
the
leaflets
were
harassed.
they
were
called
names
by
the
customers
who
came
in,
but
they
did
not
in
turn
harass
the
employees
simply
by
standing.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
urged
upon
the
court
to
find
the
conclusion
of
law
rather
that
the
employees
were
engaged
in
furthering
a
grievance.
they
were
seeking
that
which
the
contract
promised
them.
if
they
were
bargaining,
there
would
be
problems.
an
employer
can't
be
asked
to
recognize
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
more
than
one
unit
--
more
than
one
union,
i'm
sorry.
the
statute
makes
that
very
clear.
but
the
statute
also
makes
it
clear
that
employees
whether
individually
or
in
combination
and
section
9
(a)
talks
about
groups
of
employees
who
may
have
grievances,
have
every
right
under
the
statute,
quite
apart
from
the
racial
issue
to
pursue
that
grievance.
that's
what
the
employees
did
here.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
i
don't
believe
they
can
strike
under
this
contract
in
this
case.
there
is
no
strike
provision.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
contract
that
prohibits
picketing
much
less
distribution
of
leaflets
which
the
contract
couldn't
do,
contract
couldn't
waive
that.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
the
contract
does
say
they
couldn't
strike.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
the
group
is
not
a
union.
there
is
no
case
that
i
have
found
and
i
have
looked
very
hard
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
these
employees?
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no.
they
don't
want
a
union.
they
want
to
work
through
their
own
union.
they
tried
that
for
seven
months.
now
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
have
the
employer
implement
the
contract
provision
which
their
union
gained
for
them
but
hasn't
really
implemented
itself.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
it's
only
the
employer
which
could
give
them
this
which
they
asked
for
which
was
nondiscrimination
in
employment,
but
the
union
had
a
duty
to
help
them
to
get
it
from
the
employer.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
well,
the
union
of
course
have
the
duty
to
make
a
grievance
and
it's
the
specific
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
union
did
not
discharge
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
no,
not
at
all.
we
would
like
the
union
to
do
the
union's
work,
and
that's
i
think
at
the
heart
of
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no
because
there
was
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
there
was
little
conflict
between
the
employees
and
the
union.
the
employees
didn't
try
to
undermine
or
replace
the
union
and
the
union
recognized
that
as
its
appearance
here
before
this
court
i
think
is
clearly
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no
it
ought
not
to
be,
your
honor,
but
it
proved
to
be
in
this
case
and
the
employees
waited
seven
months
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
statute
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
is
the
operative
section
with
regard
to
picketing
has
three
requirements,
your
honor.
one,
that
there
would
be
picketing,
two
that
the
picketing
be
performed
by
a
labor
union
which
hollins
and
hawkins
certainly
were
not.
third,
that
what
they
sought
was
recognition,
it
certainly
didn't
seek
recognition.
they
were
trying
to
prosecute
a
grievance.
they
did
not
ever
suggest
that
they
were
interested
in
accoutrements
of
collective
bargaining.
they
were
not
looking
toward
an
ongoing
relationship
with
the
employer
that
would
include
formal
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
they
were
there
for
one
purpose
only,
to
implement
the
statutory
and
their
contractual
right
to
nondiscrimination
in
employment.
8
(b)
7
(a)
does
not
apply
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
in
fact,
the
board
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
picketing
and
that
made
no
difference
to
the
resolution.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
now,
i
think
that
those
are
not
findings,
so
much
as
conclusions
of
law
which
this
court
has
the
authority
and
often
exercises
the
authority
to
correct,
but
i
need
to
make
it
clear
that
we
don't
apologize
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
we
find
it
that
we
are
altogether
able
to
support
that
in
every
way.
what
we
do
think
is
that
it's
analytically
clear
to
call
what
happened
prosecution
of
a
grievance
and
distribution
of
leaflets,
and
we
think
that
that
more
clearly
reflects
the
facts
in
the
record,
but
we
certainly
don't
mean
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
it's
necessary
to
find
either
of
those
things
in
order
to
support
the
result
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reached.
i
wanted
to
mention
just
a
few
facts.
in
november
1968,
tom
hollins
and
jim
hawkins,
two
black
stock
clerks
at
the
emporium
were
fired
because
as
their
warning
notices
and
as
their
termination
slip
said,
they
twice
had
distributed
leaflets
to
the
public
protesting
their
employer's
racially
discriminatory
employment
practices.
this
is
the
only
reason
for
discharge
mentioned
either
in
the
preliminary
warnings
or
in
the
discharge
slips
themselves.
no
one
disputes
that
the
employees
concerted
activity
was
an
effort
to
vindicate
their
statutory
and
contractual
rights
to
nondiscrimination,
rights
as
this
court
has
said
of
the
highest
priority;
now
that
their
conduct
was
peaceful.
there
was
no
violence,
no
obstruction,
they
were
on
a
public
sidewalk,
there
was
no
harassment
of
customers,
no
disparagement
of
goods
and
services,
no
appeal
to
the
employees,
no
work
stoppage,
no
strike.
they
leafleted
twice
on
saturdays
on
their
own
time.
no
one
disputes
that
the
concerted
activities
were
based
on
a
good
faith
belief.
in
fact,
it
was
the
union's
official
position
that
discrimination
was
being
practiced
at
the
emporium.
no
one
disputes
that
for
seven
months,
hollins
and
hawkins
tried
to
work
through
the
union,
that
they
undertook
their
own
efforts
only
when
it
became
clear
that
they
could
not
succeed
in
a
realistic
remedy
for
racial
discrimination
by
following
the
union's
processes
and
the
union
advised
them
that
they
were
free
as
individuals
to
do
what
they
intended
to
do.
the
question
before
the
court
then
we
would
say
is
whether
this
lawful
concerted
activity
somehow
is
deprived
of
the
protection
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
it
may
have
threatened
or
harmed
union
management
relations.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
the
activities
were
protected.
the
discharges
were
prohibited,
that
the
activities
which
the
court
characterized
as
attempts
to
bargain,
constituted
such
limited
interference
with
section
9
(a)
exclusivity
principles
that
because
of
the
employees'
purpose
in
vindicating
their
important
rights,
employees
remained
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
we
are
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
we
have
some
arguments
we've
been
pushing
through
a
long
time
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
have
great
objection.
i
have
very
weak
argument
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
have
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
that's
right
and
i
think
the
appropriate
thing
for
the
court
to
do
and
i
believe
on
remand
that
the
board
has
before
it
the
question
of
the
jefferson
standard
issue
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
reached
that,
but
i
think
it's
implicit
in
what
the
courts
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes
i
do.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
believe
the
employees
were
fired
here
because
they
on
two
saturdays
distributed
leaflets
which
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
of
course.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes,
that's
all
that
is
stated
on
the
face
of
the
warning
notice
or
the
discharge
letter,
and
it
was
in
response
to
those
that
the
union
immediately
filed
grievance.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
well,
there
is
suggestion
that
there
is
disloyalty,
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
they
didn't
mention
jefferson
standard
on
the
slip.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
think
they
believe
they
didn't
have
to
and
i
think
the
trial
examiner
found
it
a
difficult
question.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
the
board's
justification
was
that
the
employees
again
were
intent
upon
bargaining,
separate
bargaining,
that
this
so
undermined
the
union,
disrupted
the
union
management
relationship
that
by
virtue
of
the
principles
inherent
in
section
9
(a)
of
the
act,
they
simply
were
engaging
in
a
prohibited
activity.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
believe
jefferson
standard
so
holds.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
don't
think
that
the
racial
element
in
the
case
needs
the
jefferson
standard.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
we
have
discussed
already
and
i
see
no
reason
to
go
over
why
we
think
the
employees
were
engaged
in
protest
activity
and
why
would
we
think
that
the
employees
were
engaged
in
the
presentation
of
a
grievance,
that
they
were
not
bargaining.
but
even
if
it
is
bargaining,
as
the
lower
courts
concluded
and
i've
mentioned
before,
we
fully
support
the
court's
opinion,
hawkins
and
hollins
are
still
protected
because
here
on
the
facts,
hawkins
and
hollins
first
went
to
the
union.
they
tried
to
work
through
the
union
and
with
the
union
for
seven
months.
i
think
gardner-denver
case
that
my
opposing
attorney
has
suggested
to
the
court
--
brought
to
the
court
indicates
that
these
kinds
of
informal
resolution
or
racial
problems
is
always
a
preferred
method
where
it
can
work.
if
you
can
go
the
union,
the
union
can
bring
it
to
the
employer.
if
you
can
affect
the
remedy,
good.
the
employees
abandoned
the
union
only
when
the
futility
of
their
staying
with
the
union
became
clear,
and
when
the
union
had
told
them
that
they
were
free
to
undertake
the
individual
action
that
they
intended
to
take.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
employees
normally
cannot
do
that
in
a
labor
management
situation.
first
of
all
because
of
the
special
characteristics
of
picketing,
secondly
because
during
the
period
of
a
contract
or
during
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
the
major
point
of
difference
i
think
would
be
that
under
a
regular
kind
of
problem
that
the
employees
have
section
9
(a)
has
made
it
clear
that
their
recourse
is
to
try
to
work
first
through
the
union,
their
exclusive
bargaining
agent,
then
to
go
the
employer
with
a
grievance
if
that
proved
necessary.
now
the
employer
has
no
duty
to
meet,
there
was
one
question
that
came
up
early
--
earlier.
it's
clear
under
section
9
(a)
that
the
employer
has
no
duty
to
meet
with
the
employees,
but
he
can
if
he
wishes
and
if
he
cares
to
make
an
adjustment
that
is
consistent
with
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
then
he
is
got
to
call
the
union
in
to
be
present
at
that
adjustment.
it's
another
reason
if
i
can
divert
for
just
this
point,
it's
another
reason
why
we
think
it's
better
analytically
to
see
this
as
a
grievance
because
then
there
is
a
very
practical
method
of
working
out
minority
problems.
minority
members,
if
they
find
that
the
union
has
not
been
as
responsive
as
is
necessary,
may
go
to
the
employer.
if
the
employer
wants
to
deal
with
them,
then
all
he
is
got
to
do
is
follow
the
procedure
under
section
9
(a)
and
call
in
the
union
to
be
present
or
hopefully
before
that
and
to
help
to
negotiate
the
adjustment
that
the
contract
requires
and
that
the
law
requires.
i'm
not
certain
that
i
have
answered
your
question.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
but
perhaps
not
on
the
question
you
had
in
mind.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
think
the
record
is
clear
from
the
testimony
of
hollins
and
hawkins
themselves
that
they
abandoned
the
union
principally
because
after
waiting
seven
months,
the
union
insisted
upon
handling
the
problem
as
if
there
were
a
serious
seriatim
of
individual
grievances
which
should
be
adjusted
individually.
and
hollins
and
hawkins
were
scared
to
death,
that
what
would
happened
was
that
there
would
be
some
token
individual
adjustments
and
in
fact,
that's
exactly
what
happened.
there
were
at
least
one,
perhaps
two
adjustments
of
promotion
on
behalf
of
minority
employees
and
that
was
1968
and
not
a
single
thing
has
happened
since.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
there
is
nothing
in
the
contract
that
would
tend
to
prevent
that
kind
of
group
presentation
and
the
law
specifically
permits
it.
section
9
(a)
speaks
of
grievances
presented
by
individuals
or
groups
of
individuals.
so,
i
don't
think
the
contract
could
attempt
to
prohibit
that
even
if
we
wanted
to,
it
would
be
unlawful.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
hecht
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i,
believe
the
contract
is
silent
on
that.
i'm
unaware
of
anything
in
the
contract
that
states
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
provides
for
a
term
that
there
should
be
discrimination
in
employment
and
that's
what
hollins
and
hawkins
wanted.
they
didn't
want
more
than
the
whites,
they
didn't
want
more
than
any
other
racial
or
ethnic
minority
or
sexual
minority.
all
they
wanted
was
parity.
they
wanted
what
the
contract
provided,
that's
why
it
was
a
grievance.
they
wanted
to
implement
a
term
of
the
contract
as
well
as
to
implement
a
statutory
right.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
the
question
went
not
so
much
to
processing
as
it
did
to
remedy.
that
hollins
and
hawkins
wanted
a
remedy
that
would
establish
equal
employment
opportunity
for
all
minorities,
racial,
ethnic
and
sexual.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
oh!
no.
no,
it
was
nondiscrimination
in
employment
of
those
who
were
present
at
the
emporium.
most
of
the
record
testimony
which
has
to
do
with
what
the
employees
did,
how
they
ascertained
as
a
good
faith
belief
that
there
was
discrimination
really
goes
to
the
placement
of
individuals
throughout
the
store
and
to
their
promotion.
i
think
it's
silent
as
to
hiring,
although
there
is
statistical
information
in
the
record
that
the
hiring
was
not
so
good
either.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
that
maybe
frank
to
say
that
at
first
i
was
troubled
by
that
standard
too,
and
i'd
like
to
offer
following
observations
on
it
if
i
can.
i
think
the
standard
attempts
to
go
a
little
bit
farther
than
the
court
has
gone
in
its
duty
of
fair
representation
of
cases.
duty
of
fair
representation
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
always
requires
a
showing
of
malice.
the
union
here
was
not
malicious.
they
simply
weren't
effective.
i
think
as
the
court
below
is
suggesting
that
that
kind
of
inactivity,
or
ineffectiveness
or
disinterest
maybe
enough
to
permit
employees
to
try
to
go
out
without
the
union.
the
board
administers
phrases
and
standards
of
that
amorphousness
all
the
time,
your
honor.
they
administer
standards
such
as
duty
to
bargain,
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
these
are
very
difficult
duty
of
fair
representation,
these
are
very
difficult
as
words
alone
to
administer,
but
that's
what
the
administrative
agency
does.
as
this
court
has
said
in
a
case
involving
jurisdictional
disputes,
soon
after
that
section
of
the
statute
became
implemented,
the
difficulty
of
administering
a
standard
is
not
a
reason
for
the
board,
not
to
accept
the
jurisdiction
to
administer
the
standard.
it
maybe
difficult,
but
doesn't
give
them
an
excuse
to
avoid
it.
finally
and
may
i
point
out
that
recently
in
a
case
that
we
cited
several
times
in
our
brief,
the
case
of
the
labor
boards
called
bekins,
bekins
moving.
the
board
showed
that
it
was
willing
to
get
into
the
very
difficult
area
of
race
discrimination.
when
the
question
came
up,
should
a
union
be
certified
after
it
had
won
an
election,
but
the
employer
alleged
that
the
union
was
practicing
discrimination.
that's
not
easy
either,
and
the
board
said
that.
they
said
it's
a
difficult
test
that
we
have
set
for
ourselves,
but
we're
going
to
take
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
we're
going
to
do
it
because
we
think
the
constitution
requires
that.
i
don't
think
that
the
test
which
the
court
of
appeals
is
suggested
here
is
anymore
difficult
than
those
which
the
board
has
voluntarily
and
over
a
period
of
time
administered.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
starting
on
my
own
presentation,
i
would
like
to
respond
briefly
to
some
of
the
points
that
preceding
counsel
had
made
and
some
of
the
questions
which
have
been
asked
by
the
court.
let
me
take
them
in
reverse
order.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
jefferson
standard
question
is
not
here
before
the
court
at
this
time.
that
was
the
issue
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
to
the
board
to
determine
whether
there
had
been
such
a
display
of
disloyalty
that
the
employees
ought
not
to
be
rehired,
but
the
court
recognized
that
the
trial
examiner
who
wrote
the
decision
which
the
board
adopted,
while
he
had
made
extensive
findings
of
fact,
had
declined
to
rule
on
the
issue
and
on
that
basis,
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
rule
on
it
either.
i
think
it's
not
been
raised
in
the
petitions
for
certiorari,
and
it
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
i
trust
from
my
briefs
that
it's
clear
that
we
are
not
here
advocating
collective
bargaining
according
to
race.
it's
quite
the
opposite.
it's
the
purpose
of
our
position
to
encourage
unions
and
management
to
be
more
responsive
to
the
problems
of
minorities
and
to
solve
those
problems
within
the
framework
of
collective
bargaining.
courts
have
said,
we
think
it's
correct,
that
there
cannot
be
strong
concerted
union
activity
so
long
as
the
employees
are
divided.
that
would
be
the
case
if
the
union
had
no
responsibility,
if
the
employer
had
no
responsibility.
we
think
what
we
are
urging
upon
the
court
is
a
method
by
which
minorities
can
be
accommodated
by
which
statutes
can
be
accommodated
so
that
industrial
peace
will
continue.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
if
the
women
engaged
in
their
concerted
activities
on
a
good
faith
of
belief
as
the
court
found,
if
the
women
had
attempted
to
go
through
the
union,
for
seven
months,
hollins
and
hawkins
tried
very
hard
to
use
the
processes
which
the
union
controlled;
that
is
to
say
the
grievance
process.
it
proved
to
be
a
futile
attempt
and
at
that
point
reluctantly
hollins
and
hawkins
with
the
advice
of
the
union
that
what
they
intended
to
do
was
not
unlawful,
did
not
violate
the
terms
of
the
contract
abandoned
the
union.
if
the
women
had
the
strong
statistical
support
for
their
claims
that
we
knew
it
was
a
good
faith
claim,
then
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
we
would
make
exactly
the
same
position.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
mr.
justice
burger,
if
all
of
the
facts
which
i've
listed
before
were
present,
if
there
were
discrimination
and
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
employer
was
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race
for
instance,
or
religion
as
you
have
suggested,
yes,
our
answer
would
be
the
same,
we
think
that's
what
the
law
requires.
i
think
it
important
to
remind
the
court
that
this
case
involves
a
discharge.
it
does
not
involve
a
refusal
to
bargain.
no
one
has
made
that
charge.
it's
really
not
before
the
court.
what
is
before
the
court
is
the
employer's
ability
to
fire
these
two
employees
for
having
engaged
in
the
concerted
activity
in
which
they
engaged.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
not
at
all
your
honor.
we've
not
argued
the
jefferson
standard
issue
in
our
brief
to
this
court
because
we
didn't
believe
it
was
appropriate.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
we
think
that
title
vii
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
it
does
not
make
a
difference.
it
makes
it
crystal
clear,
but
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
itself
prohibits
discrimination
in
employment
and
protects
concerted
activity
of
employees.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
absolutely,
absence
of
title
vii.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
it
is
not
absent
the
racial
factor.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
let
me
try
to
break
the
question
down
for
a
minute
if
i
can.
in
this
case,
we've
alleged
that
what
the
employees
have
done
was
to
seek
parity,
that
is
to
say
they
have
sought
what
the
contract
as
well
as
statute
requires.
there
is
a
nondiscrimination
clause
in
the
contract.
the
employees
here
sought
to
implement
that
provision,
that
was
their
purpose.
we've
also
argued
that
picketing
is
not
involved
here.
while
the
board
and
the
court
did
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
employees
had
picketed
and
there
is
no
sense
trying
to
hide
that,
the
facts
also
show
that
what
the
employees
did
was
to
distribute
handbills;
there
is
no
sense
hiding
that
either.
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
facts
and
to
draw
the
proper
legal
conclusion
based
on
those
facts,
and
the
facts
are
simply
not
in
dispute.
there
is
no
factual
allegation
in
the
record.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
these
employees
moved
with
signs
or
placards.
the
court
has
found
that
picketing
is
very
different
from
leafleting
and
that
there's
an
element
often
of
coercion
stated
or
unstated
to
picketing,
but
that's
not
present
here.
the
employees
were
stationary.
they
distributed
pieces
of
paper
with
printing
on
it.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
they
were
not
stationed
in
the
doorway,
your
honor.
they
were
stationed
near
the
doorway,
but
the
record
is
also
clear
that
there
was
no
harassment,
no
violence,
no
incitement
to
violence,
no
obstruction
of
customers.
there
wasn't
even
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
well,
the
people
who
were
distributing
the
leaflets
were
harassed.
they
were
called
names
by
the
customers
who
came
in,
but
they
did
not
in
turn
harass
the
employees
simply
by
standing.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
urged
upon
the
court
to
find
the
conclusion
of
law
rather
that
the
employees
were
engaged
in
furthering
a
grievance.
they
were
seeking
that
which
the
contract
promised
them.
if
they
were
bargaining,
there
would
be
problems.
an
employer
can't
be
asked
to
recognize
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
more
than
one
unit
--
more
than
one
union,
i'm
sorry.
the
statute
makes
that
very
clear.
but
the
statute
also
makes
it
clear
that
employees
whether
individually
or
in
combination
and
section
9
(a)
talks
about
groups
of
employees
who
may
have
grievances,
have
every
right
under
the
statute,
quite
apart
from
the
racial
issue
to
pursue
that
grievance.
that's
what
the
employees
did
here.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
i
don't
believe
they
can
strike
under
this
contract
in
this
case.
there
is
no
strike
provision.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
contract
that
prohibits
picketing
much
less
distribution
of
leaflets
which
the
contract
couldn't
do,
contract
couldn't
waive
that.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
the
contract
does
say
they
couldn't
strike.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
the
group
is
not
a
union.
there
is
no
case
that
i
have
found
and
i
have
looked
very
hard
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
these
employees?
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no.
they
don't
want
a
union.
they
want
to
work
through
their
own
union.
they
tried
that
for
seven
months.
now
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
have
the
employer
implement
the
contract
provision
which
their
union
gained
for
them
but
hasn't
really
implemented
itself.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
it's
only
the
employer
which
could
give
them
this
which
they
asked
for
which
was
nondiscrimination
in
employment,
but
the
union
had
a
duty
to
help
them
to
get
it
from
the
employer.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
well,
the
union
of
course
have
the
duty
to
make
a
grievance
and
it's
the
specific
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
union
did
not
discharge
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
no,
not
at
all.
we
would
like
the
union
to
do
the
union's
work,
and
that's
i
think
at
the
heart
of
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no
because
there
was
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
there
was
little
conflict
between
the
employees
and
the
union.
the
employees
didn't
try
to
undermine
or
replace
the
union
and
the
union
recognized
that
as
its
appearance
here
before
this
court
i
think
is
clearly
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no
it
ought
not
to
be,
your
honor,
but
it
proved
to
be
in
this
case
and
the
employees
waited
seven
months
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
statute
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
is
the
operative
section
with
regard
to
picketing
has
three
requirements,
your
honor.
one,
that
there
would
be
picketing,
two
that
the
picketing
be
performed
by
a
labor
union
which
hollins
and
hawkins
certainly
were
not.
third,
that
what
they
sought
was
recognition,
it
certainly
didn't
seek
recognition.
they
were
trying
to
prosecute
a
grievance.
they
did
not
ever
suggest
that
they
were
interested
in
accoutrements
of
collective
bargaining.
they
were
not
looking
toward
an
ongoing
relationship
with
the
employer
that
would
include
formal
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
they
were
there
for
one
purpose
only,
to
implement
the
statutory
and
their
contractual
right
to
nondiscrimination
in
employment.
8
(b)
7
(a)
does
not
apply
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
in
fact,
the
board
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
picketing
and
that
made
no
difference
to
the
resolution.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
now,
i
think
that
those
are
not
findings,
so
much
as
conclusions
of
law
which
this
court
has
the
authority
and
often
exercises
the
authority
to
correct,
but
i
need
to
make
it
clear
that
we
don't
apologize
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
we
find
it
that
we
are
altogether
able
to
support
that
in
every
way.
what
we
do
think
is
that
it's
analytically
clear
to
call
what
happened
prosecution
of
a
grievance
and
distribution
of
leaflets,
and
we
think
that
that
more
clearly
reflects
the
facts
in
the
record,
but
we
certainly
don't
mean
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
it's
necessary
to
find
either
of
those
things
in
order
to
support
the
result
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reached.
i
wanted
to
mention
just
a
few
facts.
in
november
1968,
tom
hollins
and
jim
hawkins,
two
black
stock
clerks
at
the
emporium
were
fired
because
as
their
warning
notices
and
as
their
termination
slip
said,
they
twice
had
distributed
leaflets
to
the
public
protesting
their
employer's
racially
discriminatory
employment
practices.
this
is
the
only
reason
for
discharge
mentioned
either
in
the
preliminary
warnings
or
in
the
discharge
slips
themselves.
no
one
disputes
that
the
employees
concerted
activity
was
an
effort
to
vindicate
their
statutory
and
contractual
rights
to
nondiscrimination,
rights
as
this
court
has
said
of
the
highest
priority;
now
that
their
conduct
was
peaceful.
there
was
no
violence,
no
obstruction,
they
were
on
a
public
sidewalk,
there
was
no
harassment
of
customers,
no
disparagement
of
goods
and
services,
no
appeal
to
the
employees,
no
work
stoppage,
no
strike.
they
leafleted
twice
on
saturdays
on
their
own
time.
no
one
disputes
that
the
concerted
activities
were
based
on
a
good
faith
belief.
in
fact,
it
was
the
union's
official
position
that
discrimination
was
being
practiced
at
the
emporium.
no
one
disputes
that
for
seven
months,
hollins
and
hawkins
tried
to
work
through
the
union,
that
they
undertook
their
own
efforts
only
when
it
became
clear
that
they
could
not
succeed
in
a
realistic
remedy
for
racial
discrimination
by
following
the
union's
processes
and
the
union
advised
them
that
they
were
free
as
individuals
to
do
what
they
intended
to
do.
the
question
before
the
court
then
we
would
say
is
whether
this
lawful
concerted
activity
somehow
is
deprived
of
the
protection
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
it
may
have
threatened
or
harmed
union
management
relations.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
the
activities
were
protected.
the
discharges
were
prohibited,
that
the
activities
which
the
court
characterized
as
attempts
to
bargain,
constituted
such
limited
interference
with
section
9
(a)
exclusivity
principles
that
because
of
the
employees'
purpose
in
vindicating
their
important
rights,
employees
remained
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
we
are
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
we
have
some
arguments
we've
been
pushing
through
a
long
time
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
have
great
objection.
i
have
very
weak
argument
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
have
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
that's
right
and
i
think
the
appropriate
thing
for
the
court
to
do
and
i
believe
on
remand
that
the
board
has
before
it
the
question
of
the
jefferson
standard
issue
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
reached
that,
but
i
think
it's
implicit
in
what
the
courts
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes
i
do.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
believe
the
employees
were
fired
here
because
they
on
two
saturdays
distributed
leaflets
which
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
of
course.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes,
that's
all
that
is
stated
on
the
face
of
the
warning
notice
or
the
discharge
letter,
and
it
was
in
response
to
those
that
the
union
immediately
filed
grievance.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
well,
there
is
suggestion
that
there
is
disloyalty,
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
they
didn't
mention
jefferson
standard
on
the
slip.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
think
they
believe
they
didn't
have
to
and
i
think
the
trial
examiner
found
it
a
difficult
question.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
the
board's
justification
was
that
the
employees
again
were
intent
upon
bargaining,
separate
bargaining,
that
this
so
undermined
the
union,
disrupted
the
union
management
relationship
that
by
virtue
of
the
principles
inherent
in
section
9
(a)
of
the
act,
they
simply
were
engaging
in
a
prohibited
activity.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
believe
jefferson
standard
so
holds.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
don't
think
that
the
racial
element
in
the
case
needs
the
jefferson
standard.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
we
have
discussed
already
and
i
see
no
reason
to
go
over
why
we
think
the
employees
were
engaged
in
protest
activity
and
why
would
we
think
that
the
employees
were
engaged
in
the
presentation
of
a
grievance,
that
they
were
not
bargaining.
but
even
if
it
is
bargaining,
as
the
lower
courts
concluded
and
i've
mentioned
before,
we
fully
support
the
court's
opinion,
hawkins
and
hollins
are
still
protected
because
here
on
the
facts,
hawkins
and
hollins
first
went
to
the
union.
they
tried
to
work
through
the
union
and
with
the
union
for
seven
months.
i
think
gardner-denver
case
that
my
opposing
attorney
has
suggested
to
the
court
--
brought
to
the
court
indicates
that
these
kinds
of
informal
resolution
or
racial
problems
is
always
a
preferred
method
where
it
can
work.
if
you
can
go
the
union,
the
union
can
bring
it
to
the
employer.
if
you
can
affect
the
remedy,
good.
the
employees
abandoned
the
union
only
when
the
futility
of
their
staying
with
the
union
became
clear,
and
when
the
union
had
told
them
that
they
were
free
to
undertake
the
individual
action
that
they
intended
to
take.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
employees
normally
cannot
do
that
in
a
labor
management
situation.
first
of
all
because
of
the
special
characteristics
of
picketing,
secondly
because
during
the
period
of
a
contract
or
during
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
the
major
point
of
difference
i
think
would
be
that
under
a
regular
kind
of
problem
that
the
employees
have
section
9
(a)
has
made
it
clear
that
their
recourse
is
to
try
to
work
first
through
the
union,
their
exclusive
bargaining
agent,
then
to
go
the
employer
with
a
grievance
if
that
proved
necessary.
now
the
employer
has
no
duty
to
meet,
there
was
one
question
that
came
up
early
--
earlier.
it's
clear
under
section
9
(a)
that
the
employer
has
no
duty
to
meet
with
the
employees,
but
he
can
if
he
wishes
and
if
he
cares
to
make
an
adjustment
that
is
consistent
with
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
then
he
is
got
to
call
the
union
in
to
be
present
at
that
adjustment.
it's
another
reason
if
i
can
divert
for
just
this
point,
it's
another
reason
why
we
think
it's
better
analytically
to
see
this
as
a
grievance
because
then
there
is
a
very
practical
method
of
working
out
minority
problems.
minority
members,
if
they
find
that
the
union
has
not
been
as
responsive
as
is
necessary,
may
go
to
the
employer.
if
the
employer
wants
to
deal
with
them,
then
all
he
is
got
to
do
is
follow
the
procedure
under
section
9
(a)
and
call
in
the
union
to
be
present
or
hopefully
before
that
and
to
help
to
negotiate
the
adjustment
that
the
contract
requires
and
that
the
law
requires.
i'm
not
certain
that
i
have
answered
your
question.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
but
perhaps
not
on
the
question
you
had
in
mind.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i
think
the
record
is
clear
from
the
testimony
of
hollins
and
hawkins
themselves
that
they
abandoned
the
union
principally
because
after
waiting
seven
months,
the
union
insisted
upon
handling
the
problem
as
if
there
were
a
serious
seriatim
of
individual
grievances
which
should
be
adjusted
individually.
and
hollins
and
hawkins
were
scared
to
death,
that
what
would
happened
was
that
there
would
be
some
token
individual
adjustments
and
in
fact,
that's
exactly
what
happened.
there
were
at
least
one,
perhaps
two
adjustments
of
promotion
on
behalf
of
minority
employees
and
that
was
1968
and
not
a
single
thing
has
happened
since.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
there
is
nothing
in
the
contract
that
would
tend
to
prevent
that
kind
of
group
presentation
and
the
law
specifically
permits
it.
section
9
(a)
speaks
of
grievances
presented
by
individuals
or
groups
of
individuals.
so,
i
don't
think
the
contract
could
attempt
to
prohibit
that
even
if
we
wanted
to,
it
would
be
unlawful.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
hecht
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i,
believe
the
contract
is
silent
on
that.
i'm
unaware
of
anything
in
the
contract
that
states
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
no.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
--
mr.
kenneth
hecht
provides
for
a
term
that
there
should
be
discrimination
in
employment
and
that's
what
hollins
and
hawkins
wanted.
they
didn't
want
more
than
the
whites,
they
didn't
want
more
than
any
other
racial
or
ethnic
minority
or
sexual
minority.
all
they
wanted
was
parity.
they
wanted
what
the
contract
provided,
that's
why
it
was
a
grievance.
they
wanted
to
implement
a
term
of
the
contract
as
well
as
to
implement
a
statutory
right.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
the
question
went
not
so
much
to
processing
as
it
did
to
remedy.
that
hollins
and
hawkins
wanted
a
remedy
that
would
establish
equal
employment
opportunity
for
all
minorities,
racial,
ethnic
and
sexual.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
yes.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
oh!
no.
no,
it
was
nondiscrimination
in
employment
of
those
who
were
present
at
the
emporium.
most
of
the
record
testimony
which
has
to
do
with
what
the
employees
did,
how
they
ascertained
as
a
good
faith
belief
that
there
was
discrimination
really
goes
to
the
placement
of
individuals
throughout
the
store
and
to
their
promotion.
i
think
it's
silent
as
to
hiring,
although
there
is
statistical
information
in
the
record
that
the
hiring
was
not
so
good
either.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
that
maybe
frank
to
say
that
at
first
i
was
troubled
by
that
standard
too,
and
i'd
like
to
offer
following
observations
on
it
if
i
can.
i
think
the
standard
attempts
to
go
a
little
bit
farther
than
the
court
has
gone
in
its
duty
of
fair
representation
of
cases.
duty
of
fair
representation
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
always
requires
a
showing
of
malice.
the
union
here
was
not
malicious.
they
simply
weren't
effective.
i
think
as
the
court
below
is
suggesting
that
that
kind
of
inactivity,
or
ineffectiveness
or
disinterest
maybe
enough
to
permit
employees
to
try
to
go
out
without
the
union.
the
board
administers
phrases
and
standards
of
that
amorphousness
all
the
time,
your
honor.
they
administer
standards
such
as
duty
to
bargain,
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
these
are
very
difficult
duty
of
fair
representation,
these
are
very
difficult
as
words
alone
to
administer,
but
that's
what
the
administrative
agency
does.
as
this
court
has
said
in
a
case
involving
jurisdictional
disputes,
soon
after
that
section
of
the
statute
became
implemented,
the
difficulty
of
administering
a
standard
is
not
a
reason
for
the
board,
not
to
accept
the
jurisdiction
to
administer
the
standard.
it
maybe
difficult,
but
doesn't
give
them
an
excuse
to
avoid
it.
finally
and
may
i
point
out
that
recently
in
a
case
that
we
cited
several
times
in
our
brief,
the
case
of
the
labor
boards
called
bekins,
bekins
moving.
the
board
showed
that
it
was
willing
to
get
into
the
very
difficult
area
of
race
discrimination.
when
the
question
came
up,
should
a
union
be
certified
after
it
had
won
an
election,
but
the
employer
alleged
that
the
union
was
practicing
discrimination.
that's
not
easy
either,
and
the
board
said
that.
they
said
it's
a
difficult
test
that
we
have
set
for
ourselves,
but
we're
going
to
take
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
we're
going
to
do
it
because
we
think
the
constitution
requires
that.
i
don't
think
that
the
test
which
the
court
of
appeals
is
suggested
here
is
anymore
difficult
than
those
which
the
board
has
voluntarily
and
over
a
period
of
time
administered.
mr.
kenneth
hecht
thank
you
very
much.
