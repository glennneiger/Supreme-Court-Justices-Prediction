justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
wallace
under
9
(a),
that
--
it
really
means
nothing
to
it
--
if
the
management
does
not
want
to
discuss
it,
9
(a)
means
nothing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
the
employees
told
the
management
we
want
discuss
this
and
management
says
we
don't
want
to
discuss
it,
there
is
no
means
available
for
the
employee
to
do
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
understand
and
basically
when
the
union
won't
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
the
union
is
willing
to
do
it,
then
management
is
willing
to
talk
to
them,
employee
is
just
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
difficulty
is
in
thinking
that
congress
would
put
9
(a)
in
there
and
end
up
with
not
giving
them
any
relief
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
employer
talks
to
the
dissident
union
member,
facing
facts,
wouldn't
the
employer
be
in
trouble
with
the
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
the
stationary
in
the
doorway?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
could
be
harassment
by
just
standing
in
the
doorway?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
say
about
mr.
bahrs
point
in
which
he
wanted
two
unions
representing
the
exact
same
group
of
employees?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
strike?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
means
they
couldn't
strike?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
the
second
union
--
i
just
don't
understand
what
this
group
wouldn't
be
a
union
in
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
don't
want
a
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
the
employer
to
give
them
what
their
own
union
wouldn't
give
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
the
employer
to
give
them
what
their
own
union
wouldn't
give
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
making
grievance
to
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
want
the
employer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
the
employer
to
do
the
union's
work?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
pass
out
leaflets
about
the
union,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
passed
out
leaflets
about
the
employer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
point
is
that
in
your
view,
this
is
the
only
way
that
the
minority
members
of
the
union
can
get
what
they
are
entitled
to,
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
