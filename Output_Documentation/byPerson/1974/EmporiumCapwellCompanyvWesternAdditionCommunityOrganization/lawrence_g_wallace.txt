mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
a
possible
limitation
to
which
i
shall
refer
in
a
moment,
the
question
decided
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
presented
in
the
petitions
for
certiorari
granted
by
this
court,
is
whether
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
interpreted
in
light
of
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
discharge
dissident
employees
for
engaging
in
concerted
activities
designed
to
force
the
employer
to
bargain
collectively,
directly
with
them,
instead
of
with
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
over
alleged
racially
discriminatory
employment
practices.
the
company
here,
the
petitioner
in
the
number
73-696,
is
a
retail
department
store
which
is
a
party
to
a
collective
agreement
and
that
agreement
contains
an
anti-discrimination
provision
set
forth
on
page
101
of
the
printed
appendix
under
section
21
of
the
collective
agreement.
you'll
note
that
the
anti-discrimination
provision
of
the
contract
prohibits
discrimination
by
reason
of
race,
color,
creed,
national
origin,
age
or
sex.
there's
a
potential
there
for
many
and
probably
most
employees
in
a
bargaining
unit
therefore
to
belong
to
one
or
another
minority
group
in
those
categories.
in
a
series
of
meetings
held
in
1968,
a
group
of
employees
covered
by
the
agreement,
including
messrs
hawkins
and
hollins,
the
two
whose
discharge
is
the
subject
of
the
decision
here,
met
with
their
union
representative
to
discuss
various
dissatisfactions
they
had
with
the
company,
including
their
belief
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
in
the
company's
employment
practices.
at
the
third
meeting,
the
union
representative
expressed
his
view
that
there
indeed
was
racial
discrimination
and
that
the
union
was
prepared
to
invoke
the
grievance
procedures
under
the
collective
agreement
to
remedy
discrimination,
in
accordance
with
those
procedures.
at
that
third
meeting,
some
of
those
in
attendance
said
that
they
would
prefer
if
the
union
would
picket
the
company.
they
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
the
remedy
that
the
union
was
proposing
to
pursue.
the
union
representative,
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
union
rejected
this
request
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
union's
obligations
under
the
collective
agreement
to
the
company.
and
that
in
his
view,
an
orderly
processing
of
grievances
would
have
a
broader
and
more
long
lasting
effect.
and
on
the
following
day
on
behalf
of
the
union,
he
formally
requested
a
hearing
before
the
adjustment
board
which
is
the
first
step
in
processing
the
grievances.
and
the
hearing
was
convened
in
october
of
that
year
and
it
started
off
with
presentation
of
evidence
by
the
union
representative
by
questioning
employees
regarding
their
individual
grievances.
this
was
interrupted
by
employee
hollins,
one
of
the
two
who
was
discharged,
who
acting
as
spokesman
for
hawkins,
the
other
one
before
the
court
and
two
others,
read
a
prepared
statement
objecting
to
the
prosecution
of
grievances
on
an
individual
rather
than
a
group
basis
and
stating
that
this
group
of
four
would
not
speak
as
individuals
but
would
speak
only
as
a
group
and
he
added
that
they
wanted
to
talk
with
the
president.
as
he
put
it
their
main
purpose
was
to
talk
to
the
president
to
try
to
reach
an
agreement
with
him
to
straighten
out
the
problems
and
conditions
of
the
store.
then
after
refusing
to
give
testimony,
the
four
walked
out
of
the
adjustment
board
meeting.
the
grievance
procedures
nonetheless
were
carried
forward
and
resulted
in
promotions
being
secured
for
two
individuals
as
to
whom
grievances
had
been
pursued.
and
this
part
of
the
record
is
the
basis
for
the
finding
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
page
103
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
dark
yellow
one,
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
page
103.
the
finding
of
the
board
here,
it
was
the
finding
of
the
hearing
examiner
adopted
by
the
board,
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page.
all
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
union,
their
dully
designated
bargaining
representative
was
endeavoring
in
every
way
available
to
it
under
the
agreement
to
adjust
any
and
all
cases
of
racial
discrimination
brought
to
its
attention.
and
there
at
least
one
and
apparently
two
cases
have
brought
about
the
desired
adjustment.
and
to
this,
the
board
added
in
a
footnote
on
page
55
of
the
same
appendix,
in
footnote
2
of
the
board's
order.
and
the
board
added
that
the
record
before
us
neither
requires
nor
allows
the
finding
that
the
union
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
so
what
the
board
might
have
done
in
a
case
in
which
it
had
been
determined,
either
previously
or
in
the
board
proceedings
that
the
union
had
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
question
that
the
board
really
did
not
reach
in
this
case
and
is
the
additional
limitation
on
the
question
presented
that
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
my
argument.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps
it's
found
in
a
different
color,
but
it
could
be
the
same
petition.
it's
the
petition
of
the
emporium
capwell
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
might
have
a
different
color.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
at
103
is
the
board's
finding
that
the
union
was
endeavoring
in
every
way
available
to
it
under
the
agreement
to
adjust
any
and
all
cases
of
racial
discrimination
brought
to
its
attention.
and
then
on
page
55
in
footnote
2
is
the
further
statement
by
the
board
that
the
record
neither
requires
nor
allows
the
finding
by
the
board
that
the
duty
--
that
the
union
was
in
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it's
in
footnote
2,
i
am
summarizing
it
slightly.
the
second
line
starting
at
page
55,
footnote
2
of
the
board's
order
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board
really
has
not
passed
on
what
the
result
would
be
in
a
situation
where
there
had
been
a
finding
that
the
union
was
in
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
counsel
for
the
board
really
can
take
no
position
on
the
matter
that
the
board
hasn't
passed
on.
the
board
was
divided
three
to
two
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
why
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
the
question
that
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
and
which
was
presented
in
the
petitions
in
what
we
thought
was
the
question
here.
there
is
some
effort
in
some
of
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
and
there
are
many
of
them,
to
an
effect
attack
the
board's
findings
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
as
to
the
objective
of
the
activities
for
which
these
two
people
were
fired.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
accepted
very
emphatically
by
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
at
least
explicitly,
let
me
put
it
that
way,
and
this
is
in
again
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
24
in
footnote
34.
page
24,
footnote
34,
the
second
sentence,
the
petitioners
dispute
the
trial
examiner's
findings
that
hawkins
and
hollins
activities
were
“no
mere
presentation
of
a
grievance,
but
nothing
short
of
a
demand
that
the
company
bargain
with
the
picketing
employees
for
the
entire
group
of
minority
employees.”
however,
we
can
see
no
reason
to
disturb
this
finding.
and
the
dissenting
judge
was
even
more
emphatic
on
that
point.
judge
wyzanski
on
page
43
of
the
same
appendix
as
he
put
it
in
the
fourth
line
there,
there
could
not
be
a
plainer
instance
of
an
attempt
to
bargain
respecting
working
conditions
as
distinguished
from
an
adjustment
of
grievances.
there
are
--
of
course,
at
first,
we
contend
that
there
is
no
reason
before
the
court
to
undertake
to
look
behind
these
findings
supported
by
all
three
court
of
appeals
judges,
but
there
is
--
what
support
there
is,
the
record
is
rather
thin
on
this.
it
all
seems
to
us
to
look
in
this
direction,
part
of
it
where
the
statements
made
before
the
adjustment
board
indicating
that
their
objective
was
to
bargain
with
the
president
about
conditions
at
the
emporium.
and
during
the
hearing,
turning
to
the
other
appendix
now,
on
page
11,
mr.
hawkins,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
in
response
to
the
question,
“what
were
you
seeking”
said,
“to
try
to
talk
to
the
top
management
to
get
better
conditions
for
the
emporium.”
how
you
are
going
to
do
this,
through
group
talk
and
through
the
president
if
we
could
talk
to
him?”
and
then
when
hollins
was
testifying,
on
pages
60
and
61,
he
tried
on
page
60
to
explain
why
at
the
adjustment
board
proceedings,
they
objected
to
taking
up
individual
grievances
rather
than
the
case
as
a
whole
and
after
he
explained
it
in
several
different
ways,
interrogating
counsel
says
to
him,
just
to
carry
it
one
step
further,
“it
was
my
understanding
that
what
you
were
trying
to
do
and
you
didn't
want
a
solution
of
the
problems
of
individuals,
you
wanted
some
basic
change
that
would
benefit
the
treatment
of
all
minority
people,
is
that
right”
and
the
answer
is,
that's
correct.
and
then
on
page
67
as
he
testifies
further
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
he
reiterates
that
statement.
i
said
that
we
didn't
want
to
have
our
case
taken
as
an
individual
thing,
as
i
stated
before.
we
all
wanted
to
take
it
as
a
whole
for
the
entire
betterment
of
the
minority
groups
of
black,
brown,
red
and
yellow
people
there
at
the
store.
and
while
the
exact
objectives
and
demands,
they
are
not
stated
anywhere
with
a
model
of
clarity,
there
is
one
indication
in
one
of
the
exhibits
to
the
record
that
begins
on
page
115
in
the
same
appendix
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
they
apparently
had
in
mind.
this
was
a
report
that
was
prepared
by
these
individuals
and
some
of
those
working
with
them
on
a
survey
that
they
took
of
the
store
in
between
the
time
of
the
press
conference
and
the
time
when
they
were
fired
after
the
two
picketing
incidents.
and
in
the
course
of
this
survey,
on
pages
116
and
117,
there
is
a
listing
of
16
high
fashion
departments
in
which
they
were
either
all
white
sales
personnel
or
only
a
small
number
of
others,
and
then
point
e
on
page
117,
--
well,
there's
point
d,
out
of
the
total
blacks,
filipinos,
chinese
and
mexican,
only
five
are
black,
three
filipino,
three
chinese
and
one
mexican.
we
demand
that
all
of
these
specific
racial
groups
be
infiltrated
into
the
areas
where
the
commission
is
the
highest,
the
second
floor.
and
again
on
page
118,
we
demand
selling
personnel
of
the
following
racial
groups
to
be
infiltrated
into
the
following
the
high
commission
selling
areas;
radio,
tape
recorders,
the
whole
furniture
department,
etcetera.
this
is
as
specific
as
anything
in
the
record
about
the
kind
of
thing
they
had
in
mind
in
asking
to
see
the
president
in
holding
their
press
conference
which
stated
that
they
were
organizing
a
boycott
of
the
store
because
of
its
racist
policies.
and
then
in
picketing
the
store
there's
some
dispute
about
the
characterization
of
their
activity
as
picketing.
they
were
acting
in
concerts,
standing
at
the
store
entrances,
giving
out
leaflets
urging
passersby
at
the
store
entrances
not
to
patronize
the
store.
this
was
characterized
by
both
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
picketing,
and
correctly
in
our
view,
although,
the
respondent
disputes
whether
it
was
indeed
picketing.
now,
the
board's
finding
is
the
essential
premise
for
its
decision
here
and
it
simply
has
not
reached
an
issue
of
what
would
be
the
case
if
this
kind
of
coercive
activity
was
undertaken
to
support
a
demand
that
the
company
deal
with
them
about
grievances.
the
distinction
became
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now
there
are
wildcat
strikes
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
many
of
the
cases
have
been
about
wildcat
strike.
my
understanding
of
this
is
that
there
has
been
really
not
much
litigation
on
this
because
section
9
(a)
which
is
the
section
at
issue
which
designates
the
rights
of
the
exclusive
representative,
and
then
has
a
proviso
saying
that
individuals,
including
groups
of
individuals
can
however
present
their
own
grievances
has
been
taken
by
the
board
to
define
rights
as
between
the
individuals
and
the
union
and
not
as
defining
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
bargain
with
the
individuals
pressing
the
grievances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
my
understanding
is
that
a
complaint,
a
charge
that
the
employer
refused
to
bargain
with
the
individuals
who
demanded
it,
is
not
processed
by
the
general
counsel
as
a
compliant
because
he
doesn't
regard
9
(a)
is
imposing
any
duty
on
the
employer
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
that
is
settled.
there
has
been
litigation
about
wildcat
strikers
in
which
the
circuits
have
split
about
whether
the
strike
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i
know,
the
board
has
not
passed
on
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
doesn't
regard
this
case
as
a
case
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right,
rather
than
to
get
the
employer
to
talk
about
individual
grievances.
so
it
doesn't
regard
the
issue
as
having
been
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
however,
the
afl-cio
to
which
it
belongs
is
found
in
the
amicus
brief
addressing
the
case
as
we
see
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
coming
out
on
the
other
side.
well,
all
of
this
leads
to
a
summary
of
the
reasons
why
we
believe
the
board's
decision
was
the
correct
one
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
principle
that
would
support
the
right
to
engage
in
this
demand
for
bargaining
is
a
principle
of
fragmentation.
these
individuals
are
self
designated.
they
hold
no
credentials
indicating
any
authorization
by
the
people
they
purport
to
represent
to
bargain
for
them.
there
would
be
nothing
to
stop
any
number
of
other
individuals
to
come
--
from
coming
forward
and
saying
that
they
too
want
to
bargain
on
behalf
of
this
same
group
of
employees
or
portions
of
them,
nor
would
there
be
any
--
the
reason
why
the
same
principle
should
not
apply
to
other
groups
who
have
statutory
or
contractual
protection
against
discrimination,
such
as
the
women,
the
elderly,
etcetera.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that's
--
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
are
privileged
under
9
(a)
to
meet
with
the
employer,
to
try
to
adjust
their
grievance
with
them,
and
that
doesn't
under
the
proviso
to
9
(a)
derogate
from
the
authority
of
the
union.
but
the
board
has
never
regarded
9
(a)
as
imposing
a
duty
on
the
employer
to
meet
with
them
and
the
cases
tend
to
regard
the
picketing
like
they
regard
the
wildcat
strike
and
the
question
is
being
whether
it's
in
support
or
not
of
what
the
union
is
trying
to
accomplish
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
no
question
that
they
have
a
right
under
9
(a)
to
do
with
the
meeting
with
the
employer
if
he'll
meet
with
them
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
that
doesn't
take
away
anything
that
the
union
gets
in
section
9.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
completely
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
the
9
(a)
is
limited
to
presenting
grievances
and
the
board
found
that
this
wasn't
an
effort
to
present
grievances.
this
was
an
effort
to
bargain
about
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
conditions
throughout
the
store
on
behalf
of
all
minority
people
and
obviously
to
bargain
about
things
that
will
effect
others
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
a
different
case
which
the
board
has
not
passed
on.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
if
it
affected
other
employees,
the
case
would
be
presented
in
quite
a
different
context.
if
they
were
claiming
that
they
were
denied
a
promotion
or
that
they
were
--
that
the
restroom
on
their
floor
was
not
maintained
in
working
order,
these
things
could
affect
other
employees,
but
they
would
be
individualized
grievances
about
something
denied
to
these
individuals.
they
would
not
be
purporting
to
be
acting
on
a
representative
capacity
on
behalf
of
a
large
number
of
others
who
haven't
authorized
them
as
a
bargaining
representative
to
negotiate
about
matters
that
don't
affect
them,
the
negotiators
themselves
individually
or
anyone
who
is
authorized
them
to
speak
for
them.
they
are
seeking
to
bargain
in
a
representative
capacity
about
conditions
throughout
the
store,
about
who
should
be
selling
high
priced
ladies
coats
and
that
sort
of
thing,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
grievance
that
any
of
them
has.
and
this
is
the
difference
between
the
bargaining
and
adjustment
of
grievances.
the
line
is
sometimes
a
difficult
one,
but
we
don't
think
it's
a
difficult
one
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
the
board
is
very
experienced
in
this
kind
of
fact
finding.
this
is
one
of
the
areas
in
their
specialization
and
expertise.
and
here,
their
findings
were
upheld
by
all
three
court
of
appeals
judges
and
they
are
supported
by
the
record
in
the
portions
to
which
i
have
referred.
and
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
underestimated
here
in
seeking
to
in
some
way
accommodate
the
normal
outcome
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
what
it
regarded
as
the
policies
of
title
vii,
underestimated
the
very
real
potential
for
interference
with
the
role
of
the
bargaining
agent
in
authorizing
others
to
speak
for
portions
of
the
people
covered
in
talking
about
what
remedies
should
be
adopted
even
if
there
is
agreement
between
the
bargaining
representative
and
the
dissidents
that
the
discrimination
exists.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
something
that
so
far
as
i
know
the
board
hasn't
passed
on
and
that
leaves
me
in
a
position
where
i
can't
make
a
commitment
on
behalf
of
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
their
usual
recourse
is
to
get
the
union
to
do
it
on
their
behalf
because
the
employer
has
to
discuss
things
with
the
union.
that's
their
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
sometimes
the
union
is
willing
to
do
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board
has
not
decided
that.
i
can't
really
answer
the
question.
it's
still
an
open
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
certainly
a
possible
reading
of
9
(a)
because
it's
quite
possible
that
the
union
is
trying
to
adjust
grievances
in
one
way
and
that
some
dissident
employees
want
them
adjusted
in
another
way
and
we'll
start
engaging
in
coercive
tactics
on
the
employer
that
are
contrary
to
what
the
union
is
seeking
to
accomplish
in
the
grievance
proceedings.
and
that
could
be
very
damaging
to
the
employer,
such
as
urging
shoppers
on
a
saturday
not
to
patronize
the
employer's
store
and
9
(a)
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
congress
meant
to
sanction
that
activity
and
to
protect
those
employees
from
being
discharged,
if
they
insist
on
doing
that.
it
does
mean
that
they
have
a
right
to
talk
with
the
employer
about
it
if
the
employer
is
willing
to
make
the
adjustments
with
them,
and
that
that
is
a
proviso
to
the
exclusive
authority
of
the
union
otherwise
has.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
varies
with
the
situation.
in
any
event,
my
time
has
expired
here.
i
do
want
to
refer
the
court
to
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii
and
to
the
other
remedies
available
as
well
as
to
the
fact
that
nothing
in
title
vii
purports
to
speak
to
a
collective
bargaining
rights
or
to
the
question
of
picketing
for
which
there
is
no
reference,
no
legislative
history
of
section
704
(a).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was
not
raised
below.
it
was
nothing
relied
upon
by
the
board.
the
board
did
not
find
a
violation
here
of
8
(b)
7
(a).
we're
pointing
out
that
the
fact
show
a
violation
of
8
(b)
7
(a),
and
therefore
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
section
7
is
not
protecting
this
activity,
is
really
the
only
permissible
interpretation
under
the
act
because
section
7,
wouldn't
protect
something
that
violates
8
(b)
7
(a).
we're
not
saying
that
the
case
should
be
upheld
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
7
(a).
that
is
not
a
ground
that
the
board
relied
upon
and
that
the
board
found,
but
it's
in
the
picture,
it's
certainly
relevant
to
construing
the
meaning
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
act.
i
don't
think
the
court
can
ignore
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
with
respect
to
the
standard,
i'll
just
say
that
the
word
remedying
and
what
constitutes
the
proper
remedy
for
agreed
upon
discrimination
is
itself
subject
to
great
dispute,
let
alone
by
the
most
efficacious
and
effective
means.
and
we
regard
this
as
not
only
putting
the
board
into
a
very
difficult
role
of
trying
to
second
guess
the
discretion
exercised
by
the
bargaining
representative,
but
also
putting
the
bargaining
representative
into
a
role
of
deciding
rather
than
what
it
thinks
is
the
best
way
to
proceed,
deciding
what
it
thinks
the
board
will
think
is
the
way
that
it
should
proceed
to
remedy
something
which
is
very
troublesome
in
the
standard
adopted,
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
a
possible
limitation
to
which
i
shall
refer
in
a
moment,
the
question
decided
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
presented
in
the
petitions
for
certiorari
granted
by
this
court,
is
whether
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
interpreted
in
light
of
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
discharge
dissident
employees
for
engaging
in
concerted
activities
designed
to
force
the
employer
to
bargain
collectively,
directly
with
them,
instead
of
with
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
over
alleged
racially
discriminatory
employment
practices.
the
company
here,
the
petitioner
in
the
number
73-696,
is
a
retail
department
store
which
is
a
party
to
a
collective
agreement
and
that
agreement
contains
an
anti-discrimination
provision
set
forth
on
page
101
of
the
printed
appendix
under
section
21
of
the
collective
agreement.
you'll
note
that
the
anti-discrimination
provision
of
the
contract
prohibits
discrimination
by
reason
of
race,
color,
creed,
national
origin,
age
or
sex.
there's
a
potential
there
for
many
and
probably
most
employees
in
a
bargaining
unit
therefore
to
belong
to
one
or
another
minority
group
in
those
categories.
in
a
series
of
meetings
held
in
1968,
a
group
of
employees
covered
by
the
agreement,
including
messrs
hawkins
and
hollins,
the
two
whose
discharge
is
the
subject
of
the
decision
here,
met
with
their
union
representative
to
discuss
various
dissatisfactions
they
had
with
the
company,
including
their
belief
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
in
the
company's
employment
practices.
at
the
third
meeting,
the
union
representative
expressed
his
view
that
there
indeed
was
racial
discrimination
and
that
the
union
was
prepared
to
invoke
the
grievance
procedures
under
the
collective
agreement
to
remedy
discrimination,
in
accordance
with
those
procedures.
at
that
third
meeting,
some
of
those
in
attendance
said
that
they
would
prefer
if
the
union
would
picket
the
company.
they
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
the
remedy
that
the
union
was
proposing
to
pursue.
the
union
representative,
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
union
rejected
this
request
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
union's
obligations
under
the
collective
agreement
to
the
company.
and
that
in
his
view,
an
orderly
processing
of
grievances
would
have
a
broader
and
more
long
lasting
effect.
and
on
the
following
day
on
behalf
of
the
union,
he
formally
requested
a
hearing
before
the
adjustment
board
which
is
the
first
step
in
processing
the
grievances.
and
the
hearing
was
convened
in
october
of
that
year
and
it
started
off
with
presentation
of
evidence
by
the
union
representative
by
questioning
employees
regarding
their
individual
grievances.
this
was
interrupted
by
employee
hollins,
one
of
the
two
who
was
discharged,
who
acting
as
spokesman
for
hawkins,
the
other
one
before
the
court
and
two
others,
read
a
prepared
statement
objecting
to
the
prosecution
of
grievances
on
an
individual
rather
than
a
group
basis
and
stating
that
this
group
of
four
would
not
speak
as
individuals
but
would
speak
only
as
a
group
and
he
added
that
they
wanted
to
talk
with
the
president.
as
he
put
it
their
main
purpose
was
to
talk
to
the
president
to
try
to
reach
an
agreement
with
him
to
straighten
out
the
problems
and
conditions
of
the
store.
then
after
refusing
to
give
testimony,
the
four
walked
out
of
the
adjustment
board
meeting.
the
grievance
procedures
nonetheless
were
carried
forward
and
resulted
in
promotions
being
secured
for
two
individuals
as
to
whom
grievances
had
been
pursued.
and
this
part
of
the
record
is
the
basis
for
the
finding
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
page
103
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
dark
yellow
one,
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
page
103.
the
finding
of
the
board
here,
it
was
the
finding
of
the
hearing
examiner
adopted
by
the
board,
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page.
all
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
union,
their
dully
designated
bargaining
representative
was
endeavoring
in
every
way
available
to
it
under
the
agreement
to
adjust
any
and
all
cases
of
racial
discrimination
brought
to
its
attention.
and
there
at
least
one
and
apparently
two
cases
have
brought
about
the
desired
adjustment.
and
to
this,
the
board
added
in
a
footnote
on
page
55
of
the
same
appendix,
in
footnote
2
of
the
board's
order.
and
the
board
added
that
the
record
before
us
neither
requires
nor
allows
the
finding
that
the
union
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
so
what
the
board
might
have
done
in
a
case
in
which
it
had
been
determined,
either
previously
or
in
the
board
proceedings
that
the
union
had
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
question
that
the
board
really
did
not
reach
in
this
case
and
is
the
additional
limitation
on
the
question
presented
that
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
my
argument.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps
it's
found
in
a
different
color,
but
it
could
be
the
same
petition.
it's
the
petition
of
the
emporium
capwell
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
might
have
a
different
color.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
at
103
is
the
board's
finding
that
the
union
was
endeavoring
in
every
way
available
to
it
under
the
agreement
to
adjust
any
and
all
cases
of
racial
discrimination
brought
to
its
attention.
and
then
on
page
55
in
footnote
2
is
the
further
statement
by
the
board
that
the
record
neither
requires
nor
allows
the
finding
by
the
board
that
the
duty
--
that
the
union
was
in
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it's
in
footnote
2,
i
am
summarizing
it
slightly.
the
second
line
starting
at
page
55,
footnote
2
of
the
board's
order
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board
really
has
not
passed
on
what
the
result
would
be
in
a
situation
where
there
had
been
a
finding
that
the
union
was
in
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
counsel
for
the
board
really
can
take
no
position
on
the
matter
that
the
board
hasn't
passed
on.
the
board
was
divided
three
to
two
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
why
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
the
question
that
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
and
which
was
presented
in
the
petitions
in
what
we
thought
was
the
question
here.
there
is
some
effort
in
some
of
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
and
there
are
many
of
them,
to
an
effect
attack
the
board's
findings
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
as
to
the
objective
of
the
activities
for
which
these
two
people
were
fired.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
accepted
very
emphatically
by
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
at
least
explicitly,
let
me
put
it
that
way,
and
this
is
in
again
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
24
in
footnote
34.
page
24,
footnote
34,
the
second
sentence,
the
petitioners
dispute
the
trial
examiner's
findings
that
hawkins
and
hollins
activities
were
“no
mere
presentation
of
a
grievance,
but
nothing
short
of
a
demand
that
the
company
bargain
with
the
picketing
employees
for
the
entire
group
of
minority
employees.”
however,
we
can
see
no
reason
to
disturb
this
finding.
and
the
dissenting
judge
was
even
more
emphatic
on
that
point.
judge
wyzanski
on
page
43
of
the
same
appendix
as
he
put
it
in
the
fourth
line
there,
there
could
not
be
a
plainer
instance
of
an
attempt
to
bargain
respecting
working
conditions
as
distinguished
from
an
adjustment
of
grievances.
there
are
--
of
course,
at
first,
we
contend
that
there
is
no
reason
before
the
court
to
undertake
to
look
behind
these
findings
supported
by
all
three
court
of
appeals
judges,
but
there
is
--
what
support
there
is,
the
record
is
rather
thin
on
this.
it
all
seems
to
us
to
look
in
this
direction,
part
of
it
where
the
statements
made
before
the
adjustment
board
indicating
that
their
objective
was
to
bargain
with
the
president
about
conditions
at
the
emporium.
and
during
the
hearing,
turning
to
the
other
appendix
now,
on
page
11,
mr.
hawkins,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
in
response
to
the
question,
“what
were
you
seeking”
said,
“to
try
to
talk
to
the
top
management
to
get
better
conditions
for
the
emporium.”
how
you
are
going
to
do
this,
through
group
talk
and
through
the
president
if
we
could
talk
to
him?”
and
then
when
hollins
was
testifying,
on
pages
60
and
61,
he
tried
on
page
60
to
explain
why
at
the
adjustment
board
proceedings,
they
objected
to
taking
up
individual
grievances
rather
than
the
case
as
a
whole
and
after
he
explained
it
in
several
different
ways,
interrogating
counsel
says
to
him,
just
to
carry
it
one
step
further,
“it
was
my
understanding
that
what
you
were
trying
to
do
and
you
didn't
want
a
solution
of
the
problems
of
individuals,
you
wanted
some
basic
change
that
would
benefit
the
treatment
of
all
minority
people,
is
that
right”
and
the
answer
is,
that's
correct.
and
then
on
page
67
as
he
testifies
further
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
he
reiterates
that
statement.
i
said
that
we
didn't
want
to
have
our
case
taken
as
an
individual
thing,
as
i
stated
before.
we
all
wanted
to
take
it
as
a
whole
for
the
entire
betterment
of
the
minority
groups
of
black,
brown,
red
and
yellow
people
there
at
the
store.
and
while
the
exact
objectives
and
demands,
they
are
not
stated
anywhere
with
a
model
of
clarity,
there
is
one
indication
in
one
of
the
exhibits
to
the
record
that
begins
on
page
115
in
the
same
appendix
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
they
apparently
had
in
mind.
this
was
a
report
that
was
prepared
by
these
individuals
and
some
of
those
working
with
them
on
a
survey
that
they
took
of
the
store
in
between
the
time
of
the
press
conference
and
the
time
when
they
were
fired
after
the
two
picketing
incidents.
and
in
the
course
of
this
survey,
on
pages
116
and
117,
there
is
a
listing
of
16
high
fashion
departments
in
which
they
were
either
all
white
sales
personnel
or
only
a
small
number
of
others,
and
then
point
e
on
page
117,
--
well,
there's
point
d,
out
of
the
total
blacks,
filipinos,
chinese
and
mexican,
only
five
are
black,
three
filipino,
three
chinese
and
one
mexican.
we
demand
that
all
of
these
specific
racial
groups
be
infiltrated
into
the
areas
where
the
commission
is
the
highest,
the
second
floor.
and
again
on
page
118,
we
demand
selling
personnel
of
the
following
racial
groups
to
be
infiltrated
into
the
following
the
high
commission
selling
areas;
radio,
tape
recorders,
the
whole
furniture
department,
etcetera.
this
is
as
specific
as
anything
in
the
record
about
the
kind
of
thing
they
had
in
mind
in
asking
to
see
the
president
in
holding
their
press
conference
which
stated
that
they
were
organizing
a
boycott
of
the
store
because
of
its
racist
policies.
and
then
in
picketing
the
store
there's
some
dispute
about
the
characterization
of
their
activity
as
picketing.
they
were
acting
in
concerts,
standing
at
the
store
entrances,
giving
out
leaflets
urging
passersby
at
the
store
entrances
not
to
patronize
the
store.
this
was
characterized
by
both
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
picketing,
and
correctly
in
our
view,
although,
the
respondent
disputes
whether
it
was
indeed
picketing.
now,
the
board's
finding
is
the
essential
premise
for
its
decision
here
and
it
simply
has
not
reached
an
issue
of
what
would
be
the
case
if
this
kind
of
coercive
activity
was
undertaken
to
support
a
demand
that
the
company
deal
with
them
about
grievances.
the
distinction
became
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now
there
are
wildcat
strikes
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
many
of
the
cases
have
been
about
wildcat
strike.
my
understanding
of
this
is
that
there
has
been
really
not
much
litigation
on
this
because
section
9
(a)
which
is
the
section
at
issue
which
designates
the
rights
of
the
exclusive
representative,
and
then
has
a
proviso
saying
that
individuals,
including
groups
of
individuals
can
however
present
their
own
grievances
has
been
taken
by
the
board
to
define
rights
as
between
the
individuals
and
the
union
and
not
as
defining
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
bargain
with
the
individuals
pressing
the
grievances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
my
understanding
is
that
a
complaint,
a
charge
that
the
employer
refused
to
bargain
with
the
individuals
who
demanded
it,
is
not
processed
by
the
general
counsel
as
a
compliant
because
he
doesn't
regard
9
(a)
is
imposing
any
duty
on
the
employer
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
that
is
settled.
there
has
been
litigation
about
wildcat
strikers
in
which
the
circuits
have
split
about
whether
the
strike
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i
know,
the
board
has
not
passed
on
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
doesn't
regard
this
case
as
a
case
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right,
rather
than
to
get
the
employer
to
talk
about
individual
grievances.
so
it
doesn't
regard
the
issue
as
having
been
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
however,
the
afl-cio
to
which
it
belongs
is
found
in
the
amicus
brief
addressing
the
case
as
we
see
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
coming
out
on
the
other
side.
well,
all
of
this
leads
to
a
summary
of
the
reasons
why
we
believe
the
board's
decision
was
the
correct
one
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
principle
that
would
support
the
right
to
engage
in
this
demand
for
bargaining
is
a
principle
of
fragmentation.
these
individuals
are
self
designated.
they
hold
no
credentials
indicating
any
authorization
by
the
people
they
purport
to
represent
to
bargain
for
them.
there
would
be
nothing
to
stop
any
number
of
other
individuals
to
come
--
from
coming
forward
and
saying
that
they
too
want
to
bargain
on
behalf
of
this
same
group
of
employees
or
portions
of
them,
nor
would
there
be
any
--
the
reason
why
the
same
principle
should
not
apply
to
other
groups
who
have
statutory
or
contractual
protection
against
discrimination,
such
as
the
women,
the
elderly,
etcetera.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that's
--
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
are
privileged
under
9
(a)
to
meet
with
the
employer,
to
try
to
adjust
their
grievance
with
them,
and
that
doesn't
under
the
proviso
to
9
(a)
derogate
from
the
authority
of
the
union.
but
the
board
has
never
regarded
9
(a)
as
imposing
a
duty
on
the
employer
to
meet
with
them
and
the
cases
tend
to
regard
the
picketing
like
they
regard
the
wildcat
strike
and
the
question
is
being
whether
it's
in
support
or
not
of
what
the
union
is
trying
to
accomplish
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
no
question
that
they
have
a
right
under
9
(a)
to
do
with
the
meeting
with
the
employer
if
he'll
meet
with
them
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
that
doesn't
take
away
anything
that
the
union
gets
in
section
9.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
completely
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
the
9
(a)
is
limited
to
presenting
grievances
and
the
board
found
that
this
wasn't
an
effort
to
present
grievances.
this
was
an
effort
to
bargain
about
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
conditions
throughout
the
store
on
behalf
of
all
minority
people
and
obviously
to
bargain
about
things
that
will
effect
others
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
a
different
case
which
the
board
has
not
passed
on.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
if
it
affected
other
employees,
the
case
would
be
presented
in
quite
a
different
context.
if
they
were
claiming
that
they
were
denied
a
promotion
or
that
they
were
--
that
the
restroom
on
their
floor
was
not
maintained
in
working
order,
these
things
could
affect
other
employees,
but
they
would
be
individualized
grievances
about
something
denied
to
these
individuals.
they
would
not
be
purporting
to
be
acting
on
a
representative
capacity
on
behalf
of
a
large
number
of
others
who
haven't
authorized
them
as
a
bargaining
representative
to
negotiate
about
matters
that
don't
affect
them,
the
negotiators
themselves
individually
or
anyone
who
is
authorized
them
to
speak
for
them.
they
are
seeking
to
bargain
in
a
representative
capacity
about
conditions
throughout
the
store,
about
who
should
be
selling
high
priced
ladies
coats
and
that
sort
of
thing,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
grievance
that
any
of
them
has.
and
this
is
the
difference
between
the
bargaining
and
adjustment
of
grievances.
the
line
is
sometimes
a
difficult
one,
but
we
don't
think
it's
a
difficult
one
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
the
board
is
very
experienced
in
this
kind
of
fact
finding.
this
is
one
of
the
areas
in
their
specialization
and
expertise.
and
here,
their
findings
were
upheld
by
all
three
court
of
appeals
judges
and
they
are
supported
by
the
record
in
the
portions
to
which
i
have
referred.
and
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
underestimated
here
in
seeking
to
in
some
way
accommodate
the
normal
outcome
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
what
it
regarded
as
the
policies
of
title
vii,
underestimated
the
very
real
potential
for
interference
with
the
role
of
the
bargaining
agent
in
authorizing
others
to
speak
for
portions
of
the
people
covered
in
talking
about
what
remedies
should
be
adopted
even
if
there
is
agreement
between
the
bargaining
representative
and
the
dissidents
that
the
discrimination
exists.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
something
that
so
far
as
i
know
the
board
hasn't
passed
on
and
that
leaves
me
in
a
position
where
i
can't
make
a
commitment
on
behalf
of
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
their
usual
recourse
is
to
get
the
union
to
do
it
on
their
behalf
because
the
employer
has
to
discuss
things
with
the
union.
that's
their
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
sometimes
the
union
is
willing
to
do
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board
has
not
decided
that.
i
can't
really
answer
the
question.
it's
still
an
open
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
certainly
a
possible
reading
of
9
(a)
because
it's
quite
possible
that
the
union
is
trying
to
adjust
grievances
in
one
way
and
that
some
dissident
employees
want
them
adjusted
in
another
way
and
we'll
start
engaging
in
coercive
tactics
on
the
employer
that
are
contrary
to
what
the
union
is
seeking
to
accomplish
in
the
grievance
proceedings.
and
that
could
be
very
damaging
to
the
employer,
such
as
urging
shoppers
on
a
saturday
not
to
patronize
the
employer's
store
and
9
(a)
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
congress
meant
to
sanction
that
activity
and
to
protect
those
employees
from
being
discharged,
if
they
insist
on
doing
that.
it
does
mean
that
they
have
a
right
to
talk
with
the
employer
about
it
if
the
employer
is
willing
to
make
the
adjustments
with
them,
and
that
that
is
a
proviso
to
the
exclusive
authority
of
the
union
otherwise
has.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
varies
with
the
situation.
in
any
event,
my
time
has
expired
here.
i
do
want
to
refer
the
court
to
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii
and
to
the
other
remedies
available
as
well
as
to
the
fact
that
nothing
in
title
vii
purports
to
speak
to
a
collective
bargaining
rights
or
to
the
question
of
picketing
for
which
there
is
no
reference,
no
legislative
history
of
section
704
(a).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was
not
raised
below.
it
was
nothing
relied
upon
by
the
board.
the
board
did
not
find
a
violation
here
of
8
(b)
7
(a).
we're
pointing
out
that
the
fact
show
a
violation
of
8
(b)
7
(a),
and
therefore
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
section
7
is
not
protecting
this
activity,
is
really
the
only
permissible
interpretation
under
the
act
because
section
7,
wouldn't
protect
something
that
violates
8
(b)
7
(a).
we're
not
saying
that
the
case
should
be
upheld
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
7
(a).
that
is
not
a
ground
that
the
board
relied
upon
and
that
the
board
found,
but
it's
in
the
picture,
it's
certainly
relevant
to
construing
the
meaning
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
act.
i
don't
think
the
court
can
ignore
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
with
respect
to
the
standard,
i'll
just
say
that
the
word
remedying
and
what
constitutes
the
proper
remedy
for
agreed
upon
discrimination
is
itself
subject
to
great
dispute,
let
alone
by
the
most
efficacious
and
effective
means.
and
we
regard
this
as
not
only
putting
the
board
into
a
very
difficult
role
of
trying
to
second
guess
the
discretion
exercised
by
the
bargaining
representative,
but
also
putting
the
bargaining
representative
into
a
role
of
deciding
rather
than
what
it
thinks
is
the
best
way
to
proceed,
deciding
what
it
thinks
the
board
will
think
is
the
way
that
it
should
proceed
to
remedy
something
which
is
very
troublesome
in
the
standard
adopted,
thank
you.
