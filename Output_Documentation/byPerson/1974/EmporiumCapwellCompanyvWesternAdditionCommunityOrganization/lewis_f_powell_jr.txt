mr.
hecht,
you
were
drawing
a
distinction
as
i
understood
it
between
picketing
and
handing
out
leaflets.
if
you
agree
that
there
had
been
picketing
in
this
case
with
all
of
the
other
facts
and
circumstances
being
identical,
would
your
position
be
different?

i
understand
that

your

but
if
you
assumed
or
agreed
for

that
there
were
picketing,
would
that
make
the
case
different
in
your
view?
