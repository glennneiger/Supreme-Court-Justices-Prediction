mr.
george
o.
bahrs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
or
elaborate
upon
the
argument
of
counsel
for
the
board.
i
would
like
in
the
limited
time
available
to
me
to
point
out
some
of
the
difficulties
and
some
of
the
unanswerable
questions
that
have
been
raised
by
the
decision
below.
when
parties
undertake
to
bargain
collectively,
they
must
first
understand
clearly
what
employees
are
under
discussion,
and
secondly,
who
in
fact
represents
those
employees.
this
requires
the
answer
to
three
questions.
number
one,
what
is
the
appropriate
unit?
number
two,
who
are
the
eligible
voters?
and
number
three,
what
representative
do
they
choose?
now
merely
because
this
case
involves
bargaining
with
respect
to
racial
or
minority
problems
does
not
eliminate
those
questions.
in
fact,
it
makes
them
even
more
difficult.
we
know
that
hawkins
and
hollins
in
this
case
purported
to
represent
all
minorities,
yellow,
red,
black
and
brown.
they
made
no
mention
of
persons
discriminated
against
on
the
grounds
of
sex
or
religion
as
specified
in
title
vii
and
that
raises
a
question
as
to
what
is
the
appropriate
unit
for
purposes
of
bargaining
in
this
case.
should
it
be
the
entire
group
of
minority
employees
or
should
the
employer
be
required
to
bargain
by
each
color?
further,
should
the
colors
be
divided
into
nationalities?
section
9
(b)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
declares
that
the
board
shall
decide
in
each
case
whether
in
order
to
assure
employees
the
fullest
freedom
in
exercising
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
act,
the
unit
shall
be
the
employer,
the
craft
unit,
the
plant
unit
or
subdivision
thereof.
there
is
no
mention
of
race
or
color
or
minority,
and
that's
a
pretty
good
argument
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
there
should
be
collective
bargaining
along
racial
or
minority
alliance.
the
point
is
that
the
congress
declared
that
the
board
shall
decide
this
question
in
each
case
and
it
shall
decide
it
so
as
to
provide
the
employees
with
the
maximum
freedom
of
exercising
their
rights
guaranteed
to
them
under
the
statute.
there
is
no
way
in
which
a
decision
could
be
obtained
in
this
case,
because
any
petition
to
the
board
would
be
rejected
on
the
ground
that
the
employer
had
already
recognized
a
representative
and
had
a
contract
with
them.
it
is
not
up
to
the
employer
to
decide
what
shall
be
the
appropriate
unit.
the
next
question
is,
who
are
the
eligible
voters?
whether
we
take
the
unit
by
color,
by
race,
there
must
be
a
decision
as
to
what
persons
belong
in
each
group,
and
in
these
days
of
interracial
marriages
and
mixed
parentage,
there
are
extremely
difficult
and
complex
problems
in
determining
what
race
or
color
a
person
belongs
to.
there
is
no
machinery
provided
for
a
determination
of
the
question
of
the
eligibility
list
of
voters
that
the
employer
can
safely
rely
upon
in
order
to
undertake
bargaining.
finally,
there
is
no
method
provided
for
taking
a
vote
of
the
employees
to
decide
on
what
representative
they
wish
to
have
represent
them.
it
would
be
folly
for
the
employer
in
this
case
to
assume
that
hawkins
and
hollins
represented
the
entire
minority
group
or
even
the
blacks
employed
in
the
store.
the
trial
examiner
pointed
out
that
when
the
adjustment
board
hearing
took
place,
there
were
four
men
who
walked
out
of
the
adjustment
board
hearing
and
joined
the
picket
line.
after
the
employer
issued
its
warning
against
the
picketing
and
leafleting,
two
of
the
employees
desisted
and
there
were
only
hawkins
and
hollins
left,
not
a
very
impressive
presentation
to
convince
the
employer
that
they
represented
any
substantial
number
of
minority
employees.
the
record
also
shows
that
in
the
meeting
that
the
union
held,
with
the
minority
employees,
representatives
of
the
eeoc
and
the
state
fepc
urged
the
minority
employees
to
go
along
with
the
union
and
that
it
was
in
their
best
interest,
and
we
believe
the
employer
was
entitled
to
express
sufficient
doubts
about
bargaining
with
hawkins
and
hollins
to
refuse
to
do
so.
assuming
that
we
waive
all
the
difficulties
raised
by
those
procedural
questions,
we
have
that
problem
of
what
the
employer
is
supposed
to
do
in
order
to
try
that
comply
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
and
if
the
court
pleased,
this
is
the
first
case
to
my
knowledge
where
any
employer
has
been
directed
to
recognize
two
collective
bargaining
representatives
representing
the
same
employees
at
the
same
time.
that's
not
easy
to
do.
the
court
suggested
that
--
i'd
like
to
read
from
the
language
of
the
court
“we
cannot
agree
that
any
inconvenience
--
mr.
george
o.
bahrs
i'm
sorry.
it's
our
--
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
29.
“we
cannot
agree
that
any
inconvenience
which
a
company
might
experience
in
being
required
to
bargain
with
the
minority
here,
while
still
participating
in
the
grievance
procedures,
justifies
withdrawing
section
7
protection
from
these
concerted
activities.”
now
aside
form
the
problem
of
dealing
with
two
bargaining
representatives
at
the
same
time,
the
notion
of
carrying
out
the
grievance
procedures
is
a
futility
because
of
the
fact
that
the
principal
witnesses
walked
out
and
refused
to
participate.
when
it
comes
to
bargaining
with
the
representatives
of
the
minority,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
what
it
said
in
its
opinion
in
alexander
against
gardner-denver.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
an
arbitration
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
did
not
bar
an
action
in
court
to
correct
racial
discrimination,
but
when
it
came
to
the
subject
of
bargaining
on
the
subject
of
discrimination,
this
is
what
the
court
said,
“title
vii
strictures
are
absolute
and
represent
a
congressional
command
that
each
employee
be
free
from
discriminatory
practices.
of
necessity,
the
rights
conferred
can
form
no
part
of
the
collective-bargaining
process
since
waiver
of
these
rights
would
defeat
the
paramount
congressional
purpose
behind
title
vii.”
that
is
a
statement
by
the
unanimous
court.
now
hawkins
and
hollins
were
picketing
the
employer,
to
compel
the
employer
to
bargain
with
them
concerning
racial
discrimination.
mr.
george
o.
bahrs
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
if
the
court
--
mr.
george
o.
bahrs
well,
the
picketers
were
fired
primarily
because
of
a
violation
of
the
jefferson
standard
case.
in
other
words,
while
they
are
on
the
payroll
or
the
employer
deliberately
attempting
to
damage
and
injure
the
business
of
the
employer,
this
court
has
declared
that
the
principle
of
loyalty
of
an
employee
demands
that
if
he
is
going
to
try
to
fight
with
the
employer,
he
ought
to
get
off
the
payroll
and
that's
what
these
men
did
not
do.
mr.
george
o.
bahrs
or
do
it
through
the
union,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
o.
bahrs
your
honor,
we
are
in
a
middle
of
a
contract.
there
were
some
questions
asked
earlier
about
picketing
or
bargaining.
it's
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
is
to
have
a
contract
where
you
settle
all
questions.
you
don't

middle
of

thank
