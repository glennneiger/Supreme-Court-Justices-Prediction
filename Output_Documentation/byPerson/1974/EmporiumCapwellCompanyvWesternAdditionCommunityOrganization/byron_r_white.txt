white
at
least
to
ignore
them.
and
that's
--
and
the
finding
of
the
board
in
that
respect
was
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
mr.
wallace,
is
that
issue
settled,
let's
assume
there
was
not
a
racial
tinge
to
this
case.
that
there
must
have
been
instances
where
individual
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
do
picket
or
have
picketed
to
support
the
resolution
of
a
grievance
in
their
behalf
or
when
the
union
is
negotiated
wages
and
hours,
and
working
conditions,
the
union
as
a
union
isn't
--
doesn't
call
and
have
a
picket
line
or
doesn't
strike,
but
individual
employees
do.
they
don't
strike,
but
they
picket
on
their
own
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
a
strike,
just
a
picket?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
that
outside
of
the
context
in
which
this
case
arises,
it
is
not
settled
whether
the
activities
i
refer
to
are
protected
activities
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
8
(a)
or
under
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
the
employer
is
requiring
his
employees
for
doing
what
i
suggested
he
was
doing?
is
that
an
unfair
--
is
that
settled
that
that
is
or
isn't
an
unfair
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
--
it
might
be
one
thing
to
say
that
the
individual
employees
aren't
entitled
to
bargain
with
the
employer,
but
it
might
be
another
thing
to
say
to
fire
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
certainly
it's
passed
--
it's
passed
order
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
a
case
of
picketing
to
gain
bargaining
rights
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
could
you
tell
me
again,
i
probably
missed
it.
why
in
the
board's
view
the
effort
of
individual
employees
to
bargain
with
the
employer
over
a
grievance
and
to
support
their
effort
by
picketing
is
not
within
the
exception
to
9
(a)?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
individual
employees
are
picketing
to
have
the
employer
adjust
a
grievance
in
a
particular
way
and
the
union
is
also
grieving
with
the
employers.
now,
why
aren't
the
employees
privileged
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
they
not
be
guilty
of
the
refusal
the
bargain,
he
refuses
to
bargain,
but
how
about
being
guilty
of
an
unfair
practice,
if
he
fires
the
employee
for
exercising
what
is
the
privilege
under
9
(a)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
the
employer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
--
so,
what
did
the
employer
fire
these
people
for
here,
something
beyond
what's
guaranteed
to
do
them
in
9
(a)
which
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
these
people
have
wanted
just
to
bargain
with
him
about
their
own
status?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
--
you
must
be
urging
that
even
though
the
employer
need
not
bargain,
needn't
say
a
word
to
the
picketing
group
that
because
it
need
not
bargain,
that
the
employer
may
fire
those
who
were
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
--
what
the
containable
position
would
the
employer
be
in
if
he
needn't
bargain
at
all,
but
he
couldn't
fire
picketers?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it's
the
title
vii
factor
that
makes
a
difference,
absent
title
vii,
absent
the
racial
dimension
to
the
case
the
discharge
would
have
been
proper
under
jefferson
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
you
don't
rely
on
title
vii
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
title
vii
makes
a
difference
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
absence
of
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
not
absence
of
the
racial
factor?
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
a
racial
factor
would
the
discharge
for
picketing
by
a
minority
where
there
is
or
isn't
an
exclusive
bargaining
agent,
is
a
discharge
for
picketing
an
unfair
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
i
take
it
you
are
defending
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
judgment
and
its
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
down
on
the
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
have
some
supplemental
arguments
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
you
agree
that
there
would
still
be
open,
the
jefferson
standard
question
before
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
it
were
found
which
it
wasn't
found
by
the
board
although
the
trial
examiner
apparently
discussed
it,
if
it
were
found
that
this
is
the
kind
of
picketing
and
would
that
justify
discharge
under
the
jefferson
standard,
you
would
have
no
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
supporting
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court's
opinion
left
that
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
read
it
that
if
the
finding
was
made
of
the
discharges
for
that
reason,
this
case
is
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
support
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
do
you
understand
then
the
claim
is
as
to
why
the
employees
were
fired?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
--
normally,
you
have
to
be
fired
for
some
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
cause
was
asserted,
that
you
just
handed
out
leaflets
in
the
front
of
my
store?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
assertion
or
finding
that
it
was
a
sign
of
disloyalty
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
board
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
board
sustained
the
discharge
without
making
any
jefferson
findings
--
jefferson
standard
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
board's
justification
for
the
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
real
reason
in
asking
was
you
would
agree
then
that
section
7
of
the
labor
law
does
not
protect
this
activity
if
it
were
jefferson
standard
type
activity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
wouldn't,
even
though
there
was
a
--
it's
the
objection
as
to
an
alleged
racial
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
in
the
light
of
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
ignored?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
to
ignore
them.
and
that's
--
and
the
finding
of
the
board
in
that
respect
was
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
is

justice

well,
