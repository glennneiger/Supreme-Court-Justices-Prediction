mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
on
what
page
of
that
petition
--
the
darker
petition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
it
affected
other
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
when
the
board
supplied
its
experience
and
resolved
this
then
it
settles
it
pretty
much?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wallace,
mr.
bahrs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
are
you
on
now,
mr.
bahrs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
do
it
through
the
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
bahrs.
mr.
hecht.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
make
all
of
these
same
arguments,
mr.
hecht
if
the
whole
episode,
it
involved
two
women
who
were
picketing
against
alleged
discrimination
against
women?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
your
answer
would
probably
be
the
same
if
we
hypothetically
suggested
catholics,
catholic
employees
as
a
group
or
any
other
identifiable
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
that
put
it
directly
on
the
jefferson
standard
kind
of
conduct?"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
already
answered
i
think
to
mr.
justice
powell
saying
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
they
have
in
fact
picketed
instead
of
handing
out
leaflets.
so
that
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it
is
that
when
the
members
of
the
union,
any
members
of
the
union
are
not
satisfied
with
the
union's
result
for
them
and
for
their
claims,
then
they
may
engage
in
typical
collective
bargaining
type
of
protest
that
is
union
picketing,
the
same
kind
of
technique
that
the
union
uses
to
enforce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
special
characteristics
of
picketing,
but
you
say
this
case
would
be
no
different
if
they
have
picketed
instead
of
handing
out
leaflets,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
enlightened
me
somewhat
on
your
view.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you

chief

mr.

do
you
have
any
further,
you
have
only
one
minute.
chief
