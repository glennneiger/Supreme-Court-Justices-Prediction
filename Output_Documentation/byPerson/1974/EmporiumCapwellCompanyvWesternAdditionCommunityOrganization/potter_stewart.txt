justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
seem
to
have
that
petition
mr.
wallace,
which
is
certainly
not
your
fault.
i
have
the
--
this
petition
for
certiorari.
different
color
from
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
well
--
justice
potter
stewart

justice
potter
stewart
and

i
don't

that
on
page
55.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
it
now,
thank
you.
so
that's
the
qualification
that
you
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
the
limitation
--
justice
potter
stewart
i--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
maybe
mention
the
fact
that
you
and
your
adversaries
don't
seem
to
agree
as
to
what
the
question
actually
is
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
larry
case
that
is
argued
by
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
including
a
good
many
amici
and
including
indeed
the
exclusive
collective
bargaining
agent
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
really
arguing
a
case
that
isn't
here,
a
case
that
well
might
be
here
if
the
findings
have
been
different,
but
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
accepted
by
the
board
and
accepted
then
by
--
unanimously
by
the
three
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
that
your
clients
were
attempting
to
bargain?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
law
assuming
absence
of
anything
in
the
contract?
when
you
begin
doing
that,
isn't
that
--
then,
you
are
no
longer
processing
a
grievance,
your
trying
to
change
collective
bargaining
agreement,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
which
provides
for
a
term
that
it
was
--
it
hasn't
expired
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
sort
of
a
group
did
they
--
a
group
processing
of
this
so
called
grievance
to
day
one?
everybody
who
was
non-white,
indians
and
mexicans,
or
mexican
americans
or
mexicans?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
talking
about
only
the
employees
presently
employed
--
then
employed,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not
talking
about
hiring?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
seem
to
have
that
petition
mr.
wallace,
which
is

i
