justice
byron
r.
white
you
seem
to
be
making
this
trial
as
being
straightforward
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
such
that
conviction
of
the
greater
offense
by

justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
feel
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
adverse
punishment
for
assault
on
a
federal
officer
and
punishment
for
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon?
and
the
former
necessarily
include
the
latter.
would
you
say
conviction
for
the
included
offense
would
bar
prosecution
for
the
greater?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should
draw
that
the
case
because
assume
the
--
assume
there's
a
conviction
of
conspiracy
and
then
there's
like
the
substantive
offense.
the
rule
was
the
conviction
for
the
included
offense
includes
the
section
for
a
greater
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
whole
question
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
see
if
i
understand.
you
had
a
set
of
two,
you're
suggesting
there
would
be
not
attack
on
basic
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
say
that
the
will
of
congress
was
clear
and
you
could
punish
for
both
the
included
offense
and
the
greater
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
same
prosecution,
you
may
charge
and
convict
and
punish
for
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
see
if
i
get
it
clarified
some
of
the
things
you
may
have
said
in
the
brief.
