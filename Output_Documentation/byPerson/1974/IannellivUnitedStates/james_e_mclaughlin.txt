mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
issue
of
whether
the
petitioners
here
were
properly
indicted
for
and
convicted
of
conspiracy
to
violate
18
u.s.c.
1955
when
they
were
also
indicted
for
and
convicted
for
the
substantive
violation
of
18
u.s.c.1955.
the
eight
petitioners
here
were
indicted
in
a
multiple
count
indictment
with
a
number
of
other
un-indicted
co-conspirators
and
charged
among
other
things.
first,
with
conspiring
to
violate
section
1955
and
then
charged
with
a
substantive
violation
of
1955.
the
petitioner
iannelli
was
also
indicted
for
alleged
violations
of
18
u.s.c.
1302
and
1341.
all
of
the
petitioners
here
were
convicted
of
both
the
substantive
violation
of
1955
and
of
conspiracy.
all
were
sentenced
on
both
counts
and
in
this
case
is
before
the
court
here,
each
of
the
defendants,
aside
from
mr.
iannelli
was
given
an
additional
two
years
probation
on
the
conspiracy
conviction.
now,
simply
stated
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
application
of
wharton's
rule
in
this
case
bars
the
dual
conviction
and
dual
sentencing
of
these
petitioners.
wharton's
rule
is
not
at
all
a
new
rule.
however
of
course,
it
was
--
when
it
was
initially
applied
some
125
years
ago,
130
years
ago,
it
was
mostly
applied
in
cases
involving
dueling
and
crimes
of
adultery,
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
dueling
is
not
a
very
popular
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no,
no
your
honor,
it
was
not.
dueling
has
somewhat
fallen
out
of
fashion
and
adultery
is
seldom
prosecuted
these
days,
so
it
really
hasn't
--
hasn't
been
applied
as
often
with
perhaps
the
two
of
them,
but
i
don't
think
professor
wharton
ever
really
contemplated
the
congressional
scheme
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
section
1955.
i
think
he
would've
--
have
felt
that
his
rule
would
have
applied.
but
as
you
point
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
not
a
widely
applied
rule
but
it
was
a
sound
rule
and
we
contended,
it
is
a
sound
rule,
and
the
gist
of
the
rule
is
simply
that
when
an
offense
requires
concerted
action
or
plurality
of
agents
that
wharton
speaks
of
it,
then
the
crime
of
conspiracy
cannot
be
added
to
the
substantive
crime.
now
in
1955,
the
statute
clearly
states
that
in
order
to
vile
a
convicted,
five
or
more
persons
must
act
in
concert,
own,
conduct,
finance,
manage
an
illegal
gambling
business.
the
conspiracy
statute
of
course,
requires
that
two
or
more
persons
agree
to
do
an
illegal
act.
both
statutes
speak
in
terms
of
minimums,
not
maximums.
now,
wharton's
rule
has
never
been
directly
applied
by
this
court
but
it
has
been
adverted
to
in
gebardi
v.
united
states
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
and
of
course
it
has
been
adverted
to
in
a
number
of
circuit
court
cases.
now,
in
the
application
of
wharton's
rule
in
1955,
the
circuits
are
not
in
agreement.
they're
in
conflict
and
i
assume
that
this
is
one
of
the
fundamental
reasons
why
we're
here.
the
solicitor
general
did
not
oppose
our
petition
for
certiorari.
the
seventh
circuit
in
united
states
v.
hunter
has
held
that
wharton's
rule
clearly
applies.
the
second
circuit,
which
was
the
first
circuit
to
consider
the
problem,
has
held
that
it
did
not.
the
third
circuit
followed
the
second,
and
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
sort
of
went
off
on
their
own
but
also
following
the
second.
now,
we
feel
that
the
reasoning
in
hunter
is
in
fact
the
proper
reasoning
because
they
state
there
that
there
is
no
element
or
an
early
ingredient
in
the
conspiracy
which
is
not
present
in
the
completed
crime,
and
we
think
that's
what
wharton's
rule
was
all
about.
it
requires
a
minimum
of
five
or
more
persons
to
own,
conduct,
finance
or
manage
an
illegal
gambling
enterprise
to
constitute
the
substantive
violation
of
1955.
now,
we
contend
that
when
those
five
persons
own,
conduct,
manage
or
finance
an
illegal
gambling
enterprise,
they
are
in
effect
agreeing
to
do
so
and
conspiring
to
do
so.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
and
it
in
part
is
proper
that
if
the
substantive
crime
can
be
successfully
maintained
by
a
single
individual,
then
wharton's
rule
in
effect
has
no
application.
and
in
aide
of
that
proposition,
the
government
cites
a
hypothetical
situation
at
page
28
of
its
brief
in
which
it
indicates
that
it
would
be
possible
for
a
single
person
to
be
convicted
of
the
substantive
violation
of
1955
and
the
situation
where
a
single
bookmaker
hires
ten
high
school
students
who
are
deluded
into
thinking
that
they're
involved
in
a
market
research
product
and
do
not
realize
that
they're
in
the
bookmaking
operation.
well
unfortunately,
i
don't
represent
ten
high
school
students,
and
ten
high
school
students
weren't
involved
in
the
case
that
brings
us
here.
that
hypothetical
situation
as
professor
wright
points
out
in
our
reply
brief
might
be
very
interesting
in
a
law
school
classroom,
but
this
is
a
real
case
and
this
kind
of
cases
involve
real
people.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes,
i
think
so,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
perhaps
it
would
have
to
be
that
way
but
i'm
simply
trying
to
point
out
that
the
hypothetical
posed
by
the
government,
is
just
so
hypothetical
that
it
has
no
basis
in
reality
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
that's
the
position
they
take
but
the
position
we
take
is
that
they
would
have
to
demonstrate
some
practical,
possible
hypothetical
--
in
point
of
actual
practice,
any
bookmaker
who
employed
ten
high
school
students
in
an
aide
or
in
an
effort
to
operate
a
gambling
business
probably
wouldn't
even
be
mentally
competent
to
stay
on
trial.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes,
well
now,
traditionally
now,
for
instance
in
the
drug
cases,
wharton's
rule
does
not
apply
because
a
single
person
can
clearly
be
involved
in
the
sale
of
drugs
or
transfer
of
drugs.
but
here,
the
statute
specifically
requires
a
minimum
of
five.
now,
we
just
said
the
hypothetical
posed
by
the
government
is
just
so
unreal
that
it's
not
demonstration
an
instance
where
a
single
person
could
do
it,
and
the
actual,
practical
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
a
single
person
can't
do
it
and
there
has
never
been
a
single
case
brought
under
1955
and
there
have
been
many,
many
cases
brought
under
1955
where
a
single
person
was
charged
with
a
substantive
offense.
throughout
the
government's
argument,
and
this
of
course
is
a
two-fold
argument,
one,
we
contend
that
wharton's
rule
in
fact
does
apply
and
it
applies
in
two
ways
in
this
case.
one,
it
bars
dual
punishment
and
two,
it
in
fact
requires
a
new
trial
in
this
case.
now,
throughout
the
government's
argument,
there
is
almost
implicit
in
their
argument
and
in
their
brief,
a
tacit
admission
that
probably
there
is
something
wrong
about
the
concept
of
dual
punishment
in
this
area,
and
they
keep
saying,
“well,
if
wharton's
rule
applies,
then
of
course
it
only
bars
dual
punishment.”
and
i
think
the
government
senses,
as
certainly
we
do,
that
there
is
something
definitely
offensive
about
the
concept
of
dual
punishment
in
this
area.
i
think
perhaps
even
more
graphically
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
now,
i
haven's
suggested
that,
no.
i
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
it
verges
on
that.(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
i
don't
think
i
have
--
i
don't
think
i
have
to
go
that
far.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well
yes,
and
as
a
matter
of
--
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
and
the
solicitor
general
recognizes
this
conflict
and
recognizes
in
his
memorandum
in
response
to
our
petition
that
the
problem
is
a
recurring
one
and
is
of
considerable
importance.
and
it
is
of
great
importance
because
even
more
graphically
than
in
our
case,
the
problem
of
dual
punishment
is
demonstrated
in
the
case
of
grosso
v.
united
states
at
73-1412
which
petition
is
here
in
this
court
and
is
being
held
pending
the
action
of
the
court
in
this
case,
and
i
happen
to
be
counsel
in
that
case,
too.
and
in
that
case,
the
defendants
were
given
the
maximum
sentences
--
the
one
defendant
was
given
a
maximum
sentence,
consecutive
sentences
for
the
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
trial,
so
that
there
--
so
that
in
that
petition,
it's
very
graphically
demonstrated,
you
can
end
up
with
ten
years
instead
of
five.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
now,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
government
almost
concedes
that
there
is
something
offensive
about
this
idea
of
dual
punishment
but
they
take
the
position
of
course
that
there
is
no,
in
this
case,
no
trial
should
be
required
because
the
court
can
simply
just
straighten
everything
out
by
straightening
out
the
concept
of
the
punishment.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that
is
not
our
position
that
they
cannot
be
brought
because
in
this
particular
case
in
iannelli,
there
were
two
other
substantive
offenses
charged
and
the
conspiracy
related
to
those
as
well.
so
it
would
have
been
clearly
improper
for
the
district
court
even
though
we
asked
him
to
do
so
and
perhaps
we
improperly
asked
him
to
do
so
that
he
was
not
that
easily
misled.
he
refused
to
do
so
prior
to
trial
because
he
said
it
was
untimely.
it's
our
position
that
if
the
conspiracy
of
wharton's
rule
applies
and
conspiracy
is
not
a
punishable
offense,
then
it
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
jury
if
that's
all
there
is,
that
is
the
conspiracy
and
the
1955.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
don't
think
the
jury
should
be
instructed
on
conspiracy
at
all.
i
think
at
the
point
when
the
government
rests
and
the
case
is
ready
for
charge.
if
the
court
has
determined
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
entitled
to
a
direct
verdict,
he
should
not
submit
that
the
conspiracy
to
the
jury
at
all,
he
should
just
submit
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
possible.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right,
but
the
court
can
make
that
determination
at
that
time
i
think
and
he
doesn't
have
to
submit
it.
what
we're
objecting
to
and
the
reason
we
think
that
we're
entitled
another
trial
is
that
if
you
can't
meet
out
dual
punishment
for
the
conspiracy,
then
why
is
the
jury
permitted
to
consider
that
you
may
have
committed
two
crimes
when
in
fact,
only
one
is
punishable.
now,
it's
giving
the
government
two
targets
when
they
should
only
have
one.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
correct,
mr.
chief.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes,
that's
at
a
minimum.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
frankly,
if
he
has
determined
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
of
both,
then
i
do
not
think
that
he
should
submit
both
to
the
jury.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
would
think
that
he
would
submit
the
substantive
offense
because
it
carries
the
more
vigorous
penalty.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no,
it's
not
but
i
think
that
that's
probably
a
more
palatable
choice
for
the
district
court
because
i
think
that
they
probably
would
feel
that
the
more
serious
charge
would
be
the
one
that
should
be
submitted.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
right.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
but
in
terms
of
penalty,
congress
has
elected
to
make
the
substantive
offense
of
the
more
serious
crime.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
we
feel
that
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
to
dismiss
the
conspiracy.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
because
the
conspiracy
is
an
integral
part
of
the
substantive
offense.
without
the
conspiracy,
the
substantive
offense
requires
a
conspiracy.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
then
perhaps
maybe
they
should,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
at
that
point,
then
the
court
should
clearly
instruct
the
jury
that
they
can't
find
them
both.
on
this
case
of
course,
the
jury
was
instructed
just
the
opposite.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no,
as
a
matter,
i
think
that's
totally
the
wrong
approach
to
it,
what
you
portray
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
he
has
to
cure
the
matter
by
his
charge,
the
minimum,
before
it
goes
to
the
jury
but
not
wait
until
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that
they
may
not
find
and
the
defendant's
guilty
of
both
offenses.
if
you're
going
to
give
them
the
election
where
you're
going
to
submit
both
the
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense,
i
think
he
should
charge
then
that
if
they
find
the
defendants
guilty
of
the
substantive
offense,
they
should
not
consider
the
conspiracy
or
should
find
them
not
guilty
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
not
guilty
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
or
not
consider
it.
really,
it
would
be
foolish
to
have
them
consider
it
only
to
find
them
not
guilty.
i
think
it's
not
considered
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe
it
would.
i
believe
it
would.
but
if
i
had
my
brothers
advice
the
district
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
what
you
said
is
correct.
you
understand
it
and
we
understand
each
other.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well
--
yes,
they
are
bound
together.
i
can't
really
conceive
of
a
practical
situation.
i
can't
conceive
of
any
practical
situation
where
the
question
you
posed
would
occur
in
a
gambling
scenario.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
really,
that's
what
i'm
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right,
because
the
statute
requires
that
the
five
or
more
people
actually
be
in
operation.
in
other
words,
they
can't
be
prosecuted
unless
they
have
gotten
the
thing
off
the
ground.
the
statute
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
theoretical
gambling
operations.
it
speaks
of
actual
ones
that
have
attained
a
certain
plateau
of
economics
of
success
and
have
operated
for
30
days
or
more.
so
that
the
conspiracy
is
complete
when
you
have
enough
to
the
lay
the
substantive
charge.
you
see,
under
the
government's
theory,
they
sort
of
think
that
these
people
sort
of
drift
in
to
these
things.
gambling
enterprises
don't
operate
by
drafting
employees.
they
only
have
voluntary
enlistments
and
the
people
that
enlist
in
these
operations
understand
what
they're
doing.
they
aren't
high
school
kids
who
think
they're
doing
market
research
because
this
situation
wouldn't
even
be
prosecuted
because
they'd
never
be
successful
enough.
in
the
actual,
real
world
of
bookmaking,
this
conspiracy
would
be
consummative
when
the
substantive
offense
is
consummated.
so
actually
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
conspiracy
really
doesn't
--
it's
such
an
integral
part
of
the
substantive
offense;
it
really
doesn't
exist.
and
what
i'm
also
saying
is
of
course
that
in
view
of
this
substantive
statute
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
requires
every
ingredient
of
a
conspiracy,
then
we
feel
that
congress
and
the
court
should
not
count
this
dual
punishment.
we
don't
think
that
these
petitioners
should
be
punished
twice
for
the
same
crime,
and
we
feel
that
here
they
have
been
punished
twice
for
the
same
crime.
now,
i
would
like
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
they're
mutually
exclusive.
as
i
said
that
certainly
as
a
minimum,
i
would
feel
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
tell
the
jury
that
they
may
not
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
both
(voice
overlap)
substantive
offense.
then
they
must
disregard
--
not
regard
the
conspiracy
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
a
hypothetical
possibility,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
would
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
would
certainly
concede
that
it
is
possible.
the
five
persons
could
agree
and
say,
“let's
start
a
gambling
business”
and
make
one
phone
call
to
another
fellow
and
say,
“let's
do
something.”
and
that
really
is
a
conspiracy.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
but
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
probable
situation
and
in
the
instance
where
you
have
the
substantive
offense
and
the
court
is
satisfied
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
submit
the
substantive
offense
to
the
jury,
then
clearly
there
is
a
conspiracy,
too,
because
the
substantive
offense
requires
one.
if
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
hypothesis
there
could
be,
as
it
could
be
a
conspiracy
without
the
substantive
offense,
the
district
court
shouldn't
submit
the
question
of
the
substantive
offense
to
the
jury
because
it's
probably
so
clear
that
there's
no
evidence
to
support
it
that
they
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
consider
it
anyway.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
it's
somewhat
similar,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
a
few
minutes
left,
i'll
save
it.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
would
address
myself
solely
to
one
point,
and
that's
the
point
of
proper
relief.
the
government
at
page
14
of
its
brief
has
conceded
that
if
wharton's
rule
applies,
and
we
of
course
contend
that
it
does,
that
the
proper
procedure
would
have
been
to
instruct
the
jury
to
consider
the
conspiracy
count
only
if
they
have
found
the
defendants
not
guilty
of
the
substantive
offense.
the
government
further
concedes
at
page
14
of
its
brief
that
this
procedure,
proper
procedure
was
not
followed
in
this
case.
where
we
depart
from
the
government
is
then
what
is
the
proper
relief
for
the
petitioners
here,
and
we
submit
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
relief
that
mr.
justice
stewart
found
required
in
the
case
of
milanovich
v.
united
states,
which
unfortunately
we
did
not
cite
in
our
brief
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
for
the
365
us
557,
and
that
remedy
is
a
new
trial.
in
closing,
we
submit
that
professor
francis
wharton
was
buried
85
years
ago,
i
trust
that
his
rule
will
not
be
perished
in
this
term.
thank
you.
