justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
73-64,
iannelli
against
the
united
states,
we
have
a
case
which
came
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit.
petitioners
were
indicted
and
tried
for
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
federal
gambling
law
and
also
for
the
substantive
offense
of
violating
such
law.
each
petitioner
was
convicted
on
both
offenses
and
sentenced
therefore.
there
is
a
doctrine
of
criminal
law
called
wharton's
rule
relied
upon
by
petitioners
in
this
case.
under
that
rule,
two
persons
who
commit
a
particular
crime
cannot
be
prosecuted
both
for
the
crime
and
for
the
conspiracy
to
commit
it
when
the
crime
by
its
nature
requires
the
participation
of
the
same
two
people.
classic
examples
of
wharton's
rule
are
the
crimes
of
adultery
and
bigamy.
we
view
the
rule
in
the
context
of
this
case
as
essentially
an
aid
to
legislative
intent.
there
are
significant
differences
in
the
characteristics
and
consequences
between
traditional
wharton's
rule
type
offenses
and
a
large
scale
gambling
activities
sought
to
be
reached
by
this
federal
law.
in
view
of
these
differences
as
well
as
the
purpose
and
legislative
history
of
the
law,
we
concluded
that
congress
intended
to
allow
separate
convictions
and
penalties
for
the
conspiracy
as
well
as
for
the
substantive
offense
for
violations
of
the
gambling
law.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
douglas
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
part
two
of
which
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined.
mr.
justice
brennan
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
