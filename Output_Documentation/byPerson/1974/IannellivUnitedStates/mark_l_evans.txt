mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
four
contentions
in
this
case.
first,
wharton's
rule
has
no
application
at
all
to
section
1955.
second,
even
if
it
does
have
application,
this
case
comes
within
a
standard
exception
to
wharton's
rule
because
there
were
more
persons
involved
in
the
conspiracy
in
this
case
than
the
minimum
number
required
to
commit
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
in
our
contention
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
as
to
point
two,
that's
right.
third,
when
wharton's
rule
does
apply,
its
effect
is
solely
to
prohibit
double
punishment
for
the
conspiracy
in
the
substantive
offense.
it
does
not
bar
an
indictment
either
alone
or
together
with
the
substantive
offense
and
it
does
not
bar
submitting
both
counts
to
the
jury
under
proper
instructions
along
the
lines
mr.
justice
stewart
was
discussing
with
mr.
mclaughlin
earlier.
finally,
even
if
wharton's
rule
applies
to
this
case
and
does
bar
an
indictment,
petitioners
still
would
not
be
entitled
in
this
case
to
a
new
trial
as
mr.
mclaughlin
suggested
at
point
as
an
alternative
disposition.
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
new
trial,
all
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
to
vacate
the
sentences
that
were
imposed
on
the
conspiracy
convictions.
and
i'd
like
to
start,
if
i
may
just
by
briefly
addressing
that
final
point
because
it
can
be
taken
with
the
assumption
that
everything
that
mr.
mclaughlin
has
said
about
wharton's
rule's
application
to
section
1955
and
to
this
case
is
true.
now,
he
has
suggested
in
his
brief
and
he
had
alluded
to
it
again
at
argument
that
a
new
trial
would
be
necessary
here
apparently
because
the
presence
of
the
conspiracy
character
in
the
course
of
the
trial
and
in
the
jury's
deliberations
has
so
tainted
the
jury's
verdict
on
the
substantive
count
that
there
must
be
a
new
trial
to
eliminate
this
taint.
as
we
understand
the
argument,
if
it
rests
upon
the
notion
that
in
the
absence
of
the
conspiracy
count,
all
the
hearsay
declarations
that
were
admitted
at
this
trial
would
have
been
excluded
and
they
would
not
be
admissible
on
a
retrial
only
on
the
substantive
account
--
only
on
the
substantive
count.
we
think
this
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first,
as
we
show
on
our
brief,
the
admissibility
of
hearsay
declarations
of
co-conspirators
does
not
depend
upon
the
presence
of
an
indictment
--
of
a
conspiracy
count
in
the
indictment.
it
depends
only
upon
a
showing
by
non-hearsay
evidence
that
there
was
in
fact
a
joint
venture
in
crime
of
which
the
defendant
was
a
member.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
no,
we're
not
saying
they're
the
same.
we're
saying
that
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
we're
--
in
a
sense,
if
wharton's
rule
apply,
and
i'm
here
taking
everything
that
he
has
said
is
given,
if
wharton's
rule
applies
yes,
there
is
inherent
in
the
substantive
offense
the
very
conspiracy
to
which
he
objects
that
in
terms
of
a
subsequent
--
in
terms
of
separate
counts
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i'm
just
beginning
by
accepting
everything
just
to
discuss
only
what
should
be
done
with
this
case
if
everything
were
accepted.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
now,
even
if
for
some
reason
the
hearsay
testimony
would
be
inadmissible
if
there
were
only
the
substantive
count
at
trial
that
the
district
judge
here
contrary
to
the
suggestion
that
mr.
mclaughlin's
brief
makes
specifically
instructed
the
jury
that
they
could
consider
that
hearsay
testimony,
those
hearsay
declarations
only
in
connection
with
the
conspiracy
count
on
page
61
of
the
appendix.
he
made
a
very
elaborate
effort
to
direct
the
jury's
attention
to
the
conspiracy
count
only
last
and
he
stated
that,
“this
is
why
i
start
off
with
the
other
counts
and
work
toward
the
first
count.”
that
evidence,
the
hearsay
evidence
would
not
be
admissible
in
proving
guilt
under
the
second
count,
the
section
1955
count,
but
it
could
be
admissible
under
the
circumstances
i
just
enumerated
with
you
in
proving
the
guilt
of
conspiracy.
so
even
if
for
some
reason
the
hearsay
declarations
could
not
be
admitted,
should
not
have
been
admitted
in
this
trial,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
jury
disregarded
the
explicit
instruction
disregarded
with
respect
to
the
substantive
count.
our
contention
in
essence
is
that
there's
been
no
taint
attached
to
the
substantive
conviction,
in
this
case,
no
reason
to
remand
for
a
new
trial
on
that
count
in
any
event.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
question
whether
wharton's
rule
applies
at
all
in
the
context
of
section
1955,
and
before
i
address
the
statutory
question,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
outline
our
theory
of
wharton's
rule.
we
start
with
two
principles,
consistent
principles
we
believe.
first,
that
a
conspiracy
ordinarily
is
separate
and
distinct
from
its
substantive
aim
because
each
requires
proof
of
a
fact
that
the
other
does
not.
for
example,
a
conspiracy
to
commit
a
bank
robbery
requires
proof
of
an
agreement
between
the
two
robbers
to
commit
the
crime,
but
it
does
not
require
proof
that
robbery
was
actually
consummated.
on
the
other
hand,
the
substantive
charge
of
bank
robbery
requires
proof
that
the
crime
was
consummated
but
not
that
there
was
any
agreement
to
commit
it.
and
this
court
has
accordingly
held
in
many
cases
that
cumulative
sentences
may
be
imposed
upon
convictions
for
both
the
conspiracy
and
its
substantive
aim.
and
that
is
so
because
a
conspiracy
is
thought
to
pose
dangers
beyond
those
posed
by
the
commission
of
the
substantive
offense
itself.
an
unlikened
attempt
for
that
reason,
the
conspiracy
does
not
merge
within
the
completed
substantive
offense.
now,
the
second
principle
as
i
say
that's
consistent
with
this
is
basically
an
application
of
the
constitutional
protection
against
double
jeopardy.
when
one
offense
is
necessarily
included
within
another,
a
person
may
not
be
given
cumulative
sentences
for
a
single
act
that
violates
both.
for
example,
assaulting
a
federal
officer
is
necessarily
included
within
the
greater
prime
of
assaulting
a
federal
officer
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
it
is
impossible
under
any
circumstances
to
commit
the
greater
offense
without
also
committing
the
lesser.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
inferring
it
from
decisions
of
this
court,
most
particularly
north
carolina
against
pierce,
in
which
the
court
stated
that
--
and
there
may
be
others,
too,
that
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
oh,
you're
--
no.
well,
i'll
cite
some
cases
to
support
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
well,
there
are
several
in
the
footnote
there.
now,
in
our
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
we're
looking
for
a
constitutional
source.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
rests
in
our
view
upon
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
we
think
is
the
source
of
wharton's
rule
properly
understood.
it's
not
broader,
i
mean
in
a
sense
we're
--
we're
giving
it
a
constitutional
footing
so
that
it's
scope
can
be
appreciated.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
no,
wharton
--
wharton
did
not.
wharton's
rule
in
my
view
is
an
anomaly.
it
developed
as
we
explained
in
our
brief
from
what
we
view
as
a
misreading
of
an
1850
pennsylvania
state
court
decision.
there's
no
comparable
rule
in
england,
and
the
leading
british
commentator
as
i
indicate
in
the
brief
thinks
that
the
rule
is
unnecessarily
subtle.
well,
we
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
and
we
concluded
that
it
has
an
application
as
part
of
the
broader
rules
that
we
think
would
be
applicable
in
the
case
of
a
lesser
included
offense
and
the
greater
offense.
we
do
think
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
bar
an
imposition
of
two
punishments
for
assaulting
a
federal
officer
for
example
with
a
deadly
weapon,
and
for
the
crime
that
necessarily
was
included
within
it,
mainly
the
assault
upon
the
officer.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
we
think
that's
--
it's
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
it's
not
obviously
this
case.
we're
not
--
this
has
no
application
to
it.
we
mentioned
that
only
in
passing.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
we're
inferring
that
rule
from
a
combination
of
the
cases
we've
cited
but
waller
is
basically
the
case,
as
i
recall
it
that
was
a
conviction
on
a
local
ordinance
that
was
as
the
court
stated
that
the
offense
was
included
within
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
no
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
but
in
any
event,
i
really
don't
think
we
have
to
struggle
with
this
issue.
it's
not
really
presented
here.
we
only
mention
it
in
passing
to
suggest
the
contours
of
what
would
be
the
rules
with
respect
to
lesser
included
offenses
and
greater
offenses.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
we
do
not
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
was
outlining
mr.
chief
justice
what
our
view
is
of
the
proper
application
of
wharton's
rule.
we
think
it
applies
only
where
it
can
be
stated
that
the
conspiracy
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
substantive
crime
so
that
one
could
not
possibly
in
any
circumstances
commit
the
substantive
crime
without
also
conspiring
to
do
so,
and
the
example
that
we
used
in
the
brief
and
we
think
is
the
clearest
example
is
the
case
of
dueling,
which
is
defined
in
terms
of
an
armed
combat
between
two
persons
pursuant
to
an
agreement
to
do
so.
now,
in
order
to
commit
a
duel
under
that
definition,
you
must
agree
to
do
so.
you
must
in
effect
commit
each
of
the
elements
of
a
conspiracy.
now
in
that
context,
we
have
no
question
that
this
is
the
appropriate
case
in
which
to
apply
this
general
--
whatever
the
general
double
jeopardy
rules
may
be
with
respect
to
a
lesser
included
offenses
in
greater
offenses.
when
we
come
to
section
1955
however,
this
is
not
--
this
is
anywhere
anything
like
dueling.
i
think
looking
at
1955
in
recalling
the
central
question,
i
think
that
our
theory
of
wharton's
rule
is
whether
it
would
be
possible
under
any
circumstances
to
commit
the
substantive
crime
of
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
business
without
also
conspiring
to
do
so.
now,
the
statute
defines
illegal
gambling
business
as
one
that
involves
five
or
more
persons
who
conduct
it
but
it
does
not
state
and
it
does
not
imply
in
our
view
that
all
five
must
be
knowing
and
willful
participants.
the
purpose
of
the
five-person
requirement
like
that
of
the
other
requirements
in
the
definition
was
to
limit
the
allocation
of
federal
resources
to
the
large
gambling
operations.
the
requirement
is
one
of
size,
not
one
of
culpability.
this
is
confirmed
we
think
by
the
form
that
was
used
by
congress
in
drafting
the
statute,
which
is
set
out
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
as
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
congress
found
that
gambling
generally
has
an
impact
upon
interstate
commerce.
it
specifically
stated
however
that
it
declined
to
prohibit,
although
it
thought
it
was
within
its
reach
to
do
so.
it
declined
to
prohibit
all
gambling
operations
because
it
wished
to
limit
federal
resources
to
the
major
operations
of
major
proportions.
i
don't
think
this
is
an
essential
link
for
a
federal
jurisdiction
but
it
is
the
one
congress
picked
for
policy
purposes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
now
--
but
in
doing
so,
the
congress
specifically
recognized
in
its
legislative
reports
that
while
it
normally
assumed
that
more
than
five
persons
would
be
involved
in
the
kind
of
operations
it
had
in
mind
that
it
recognized
that
it's
very
difficult
to
prove
the
full
extent
of
most
gambling
operations.
and
for
that
reason,
it
chose
five
as
a
number
and
again,
i
believe
it
chose
the
number
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
operation.
it
did
not
specify
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
it
had
in
mind.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
might
just
as
easily
have
decided
to
cut
it
at
ten.
i
believe
it
was
a
legislative
choice
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
limit
to
permit
prosecutions
of
large
gambling
operations
in
which
not
everyone
could
be
proved
to
be
involved
without
having
the
federal
courts
burdened
by
(inaudible)
prosecutions.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
may
be
an
attack
upon
it.
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
the
congress
believed
that
the
reach
of
its
authority
extended
beyond
the
limits
that
was
chosen
in
the
statute.
we
believe
that
congress
deliberately
left
open
in
the
statute
the
possibility
of
prosecuting
a
sole
bookmaker
to
use
the
hypothetical
we
used
in
our
brief
who
hires
innocent
persons
to
help
him
operate
his
gambling
business.
and
it
did
so
because
it
realized
that
it
may
be
that
there
were
other
people
involved,
but
guilty
persons
involved,
people
who
are
culpable
but
it's
not
always
easy
to
prove
their
involvement.
it's
enough
to
prove
that
there
is
one
culpable
individual
operating
a
business
large
enough
to
merit
federal
attention.
now,
we
think
that
this
demonstrates
or
it
answers
the
question
i
started
with,
that
is,
whether
it
is
possible
in
any
circumstance
to
commit
the
substantive
offense
without
conspiring
to
do
so.
the
answer
is
it
is
possible.
it's
a
theoretical
inquiry
granted
and
there
probably
will
never
be
such
a
case.
there
may
or
there
may
not
be
such
a
case;
i
know
of
none.
but
this
is
a
question
of
what
would
be
possible
and
we
believe
that
in
this
circumstance
in
which
one
guilty
culpable
person
hires
enough
persons
to
operate
his
business
to
bring
it
within
federal
--
scope
of
federal
jurisdiction
that
he
would
be
guilty
of
the
substantive
offense
but
he
could
not
be
convicted
of
a
conspiracy
because
there
would
be
no
proof
that
he
conspired
with
any
other
culpable
person
involved
in
the
operation.
now,
one
might
properly
ask
i
think
in
these
circumstances
whether
congress
really
intended
that
a
person
who
violates
section
1955
should
be
subject
to
the
additional
punishment
for
a
conspiracy,
which
probably
would
be
connected
with
the
large
operation.
but
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
callanan
is
an
answer
to
that
question.
that
was
not
a
wharton's
rule
case
but
an
analogous
argument
was
made.
callanan
argued
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
subject
him
to
multiple
punishment
for
conspiracy
and
obstructing
commerce
by
extortion
because
both
crimes
were
created
by
the
same
section
of
the
statute.
the
court
stated
however
that
the
historic
distinctiveness
between
a
conspiracy
and
its
substantive
aim
gives
rise
to
a
presumption
that
congress
intended
to
maintain
that
distinction
and
to
maintain
the
separate
punitive
consequences
of
each,
and
the
court
stated
in
a
sentence
that
i
think
is
worth
quoting
that
appears
on
page
42
of
our
brief,
“to
dislodge
such
conventional
consequences
in
the
outlawing
of
two
disparate
offenses,
conspiracy
and
substantive
conduct,
and
effectuate
a
reversal
of
the
settled
interpretation
would
require
a
specific
language
to
the
contrary.”
well,
there
is
no
such
specific
language
to
the
contrary
in
this
statute
and
we
believe
that
the
presumption
established
by
callanan
should
be
applied
in
this
case
as
well.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
we're
not
suggesting
that
this
is
likely.
we're
just
suggesting
that
the
statute
permits
--
would
permit
a
prosecution
in
those
circumstances.
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
decision
in
this
case
on
a
ground
that
this
court
needn't
consider
unless
it
first
finds
contrary
to
our
contention
that
section
1955
does
necessarily
include
a
conspiracy.
that
ground
is
that
this
case
falls
within
the
standard
exception
to
the
rule
that
permits
prosecution
for
a
conspiracy
when
it
involves
more
persons
than
the
minimum
number
essential
to
the
commission
of
the
substantive
offense.
this
exception
has
been
recognized
even
by
this
court
in
the
gebardi
case
and
it's
now
accepted
by
the
current
addition
of
wharton's
treaties.
we
think
it's
consistent
with
the
rationale
of
the
rule
itself.
separate
punishment
in
our
view
is
precluded
by
wharton's
rule
on
the
theory
that
congress
took
into
account
in
establishing
the
punishment
for
the
substantive
offense
all
the
dangers
inherent
in
the
commission
of
the
substantive
offense,
including
the
dangers
involved
and
any
necessarily
included
conspiracy.
but
when
the
conspiracy
exceeds
in
number,
the
minimum
number
necessary
to
the
commission
of
the
substantive
crime,
its
dangers
are
likely
to
be
increased
also.
and
there
is
no
reason
in
these
circumstances
to
presume
that
congress
intended
to
limit
the
punishment
where
the
conspiracy
is
greater
than
--
or
creates
dangers
greater
than
those
inherent
in
the
substantive
crime
itself.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that
might
be
a
situation
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
while
only
the
one
who
knows
would
be
guilty
of
the
substantive
crime
that
he
might
well
be
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
as
well
because
while
the
four
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
i
guess
it
may
--
it
may
fit.
i'm
not
sure.
it
may
be
the
same
thing.
any
example
you
hypothesize
is
bound
to
be
an
unlikely
one
because
this
is
not
the
normal
situation.
but
what
matters
is
that
even
in
those
hypothetical
situations,
it
seems
to
me
clear,
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
statute
would
permit
prosecution
of
the
one
individual
and
we
believe
that
there
are
circumstances,
and
this
may
be
another
one
in
which
there
would
be
no
prosecution
for
conspiracy.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
of
any.
now,
on
my
hypothetical
at
least
and
perhaps
on
yours,
too,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
order
to
be
convicted
of
conspiracy,
there
must
be
at
least
two
persons
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
there
has
to
be
at
least
two
persons
who
share
in
the
guilty
knowledge.
now,
to
the
extent
that
the
four
here
do
not
share
in
the
guilty
knowledge,
i
would
say
that
their
agreement
with
him
was
not
a
meeting
of
the
minds
sufficient
to
constitute
the
kind
of
agreement
that's
punishable
as
a
conspiracy.
to
conclude,
i
think
it's
worth
recalling
mr.
justice
holmes'
statement
that
was
quoted
in
this
court's
decision
in
callanan.
he
said,
“to
rest
upon
a
formula
is
a
slumber
that
prolonged
means
death.”
well,
we
think
that
for
many
years,
wharton's
rule
has
been
applied
by
the
course
uncritically
and
we
urge
the
court
in
this
case
to
reconsider
the
formula
and
to
apply
it,
if
at
all
only
consistent
with
its
proper
rationale.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn't
quite
get
at
my
conclusion
and
during
lunch,
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
worth
clarifying
some
points
that
were
raised
during
the
pre-lunch
point.
mr.
justice
white,
to
address
further
the
question
that
we
were
discussing
earlier
about
double
jeopardy,
we
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
congress
or
a
legislature
to
prescribe
that
although
a
crime
includes
another
that
both
should
be
punished
separately.
we
think
this
is
within
the
power
of
congress.
we
think
however
that
once
it
is
determined
that
congress
did
not
intend
separate
punishment.
in
other
words,
as
nothing
was
said
about
it
at
all,
we
believe
the
presumption
should
be
that
a
single
punishment
is
what
was
intended
and
we
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
in
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
improper
to
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
now,
whether
they
could
--
it
would
depend
upon
the
will
on
congress,
whether
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
in
that
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
that
would
be
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
and
i
think
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
congress
saying
--
let's
just
take
a
concrete
example.
take
the
assault
on
a
federal
officer.
the
statute
as
i
remember
it
says
that
it's
three
years
for
assaulting
a
federal
officer,
it's
ten
years
for
assaulting
a
federal
officer
with
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
now,
if
congress
were
to
say
these
punishments
that
the
ten
years
for
assaulting
a
federal
officer
with
a
deadly
weapon
shall
be
in
addition
to
the
three
years
that
would
be
otherwise
imposed
for
simply
assaulting
a
federal
officer,
i
think
that's
constitutionally
permissible.
it's
the
same
thing
as
if
congress
said
three
years
for
assaulting
a
federal
officer,
13
years
for
assaulting
a
federal
officer
with
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
congress
could
or
a
legislature
could,
but
it
would
be
the
same
thing
as
saying
--
i
mean
it
would
just
be
an
awkward
way
for
the
legislature
to
have
imposed
simply
a
higher
punishment
for
the
greater
crime
by
saying
that
you
can
cumulate
the
greater
and
the
lesser.
it's
just
another
way
of
saying
the
greater
shall
be
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it's
not
really
--
but
i
just
want
to
clarify
some
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
our
brief
states
mr.
justice
white,
that
--
i'm
reading
from
page
21
and
22
of
our
brief
that
we
say
that
this
aspect
of
the
double
jeopardy
protection
is
of
course
subject
to
the
legislative
will
because
the
severity
and
allocation
of
punishment
for
criminal
conduct
are
peculiarly
questions
of
legislative
policy.
and
we
cite
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
didn't
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
it
would
depend
upon
an
understanding
of
what
the
intention
of
legislature
was.
if
it
were
--
if
the
legislature
intended
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
can't
answer
it
because
i
don't
know
what
policy
lies
behind
the
proscription
of
a
joint
trial
in
the
two.
and
if
the
proscription
is
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
i
haven't
thought
about
this
question,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
really
haven't
thought
about
it.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
analysis
of
the
legislature.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
nielson
was
not
that.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
in
nielson,
it
was
a
conviction
of
a
greater
offense
and
then
it
was
an
attempt
to
prosecuting
unless
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it's
within
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
provide
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
legislature
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
that
there
was
nothing
in
nielson
as
i
recall
nielson
that
indicated
that
there
was
an
expressed
determination
by
the
legislature
that
both
crimes
should
be
punished
and
punished
separately,
that
one
who
commits
both
should
be
punished
for
both
separately.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
the
absence
of
such
a
determination,
that's
right,
that
i
would
think
that
double
jeopardy
probably
does
prohibit
it.
but
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
believe
that
this
aspect
of
the
double
jeopardy
protection
depends
upon
a
threshold
analysis
of
what
it
is
that
the
legislature
has
determined.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
correct.
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
has
never
been
a
case
that
i
can
point
to,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
issue
may
be
raised
in
a
peripheral
way
and
the
case
that's
pending.
but
that's
my
view
of
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
--
how
it
works
in
the
context
of
double
punishment
for
the
same
acts
that
violate
two
provisions.
it
may
be
different
where
you're
talking
about
success
of
prosecutions,
but
this
is
my
understanding
of
how
it
works
in
this
context.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
our
position,
right.
so
in
our
view,
this
issue
doesn't
even
come
up
in
the
case.
