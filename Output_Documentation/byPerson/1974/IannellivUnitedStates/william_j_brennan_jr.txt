justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow.
you
do
concede,
as
i
understand
your
answer
now.
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
that
a
person
or
necessarily
two
or
more
persons
can
be
charged
with
conspiracy
as
well
as
with
the
commission
of
the
substantive
offense
at
the
same
trial.
but
that
the
jury
must
be
instructed
that
they
cannot
find
them
guilty
of
both,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
what
you
have
as
indeed
some
states
do,
felony
murders.
you
may
not
try
the
murder
and
the
felony,
robbery
let's
say,
in
the
course
in
which
a
death
occurs
together.
and
the
state
tries
for
murder,
felony
murder,
proves
the
facts
of
the
robbery,
the
deaths
in
the
course
of
the
robbery
gets
conviction,
imposes
a
mandatory
life
sentence,
let
us
say,
for
the
murder.
after
that,
they
try
him
for
the
robbery.
can
you
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
robbery
carries
15
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
legislature
said
in
so
many
words,
you
can't
try
these
two
offenses
together.
they
have
to
be
tried
separately.
and
in
the
case
of
the
felony
murder,
the
sentence
shall
be
mandatorily
life.
in
the
case
of
the
robbery,
this
will
be
15
years.
they
try
and
convict
him
for
the
felony
murder,
he
gets
that
mandatory
sentence
of
life.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
he
now
be
charged
for
the
robbery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
have
such
proscriptions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
why
they
have
them.
they
have
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
double
jeopardy
wise,
that
can
be
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nielson
is
a
case
that
you
cite
in
your
footnote.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nielson
was
cohabitation,
conviction,
and
later
prosecutions
for
adultery,
conviction,
and
this
court
set
it
aside.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
wasn't
included
defense
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
legislature
in
that
instance
and
nielson
did
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
utah
legislature
did
precisely
that.
they
tried
him
first
with
cohabitation,
which
was
a
federal
statute.
he
was
convicted.
and
then
he
was
tried
for
the
adultery,
which
was
also
a
federal
statute,
and
he
was
convicted
and
this
court
set
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
court
held,
as
i
understand
justice
brandeis
opinion.
i
never
saw
the
case,
that
was
cited.
if
i
understand
his
opinion
at
page
191,
that's
double
jeopardy.
and
what
can
the
legislature
do
in
the
face
of
the
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
legislature
in
that
instance,
if
it
had
said
yes
and
we
mean
even
if
convicted,
he
may
be
tried
the
second
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
said
that
many
words,
notwithstanding
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
the
adultery
conviction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
authority
did
you
get
