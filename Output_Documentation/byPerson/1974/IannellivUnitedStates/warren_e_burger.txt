chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-64,
iannelli
against
the
united
states.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin,
i
think
you
may
safely
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wasn't
a
very
wide
ranging
rule
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
you
convert
that
into
some
dangerous
drugs,
you
might
have
a
more
commercially
feasible
illustration,
might
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
okay.
on
your
thesis,
ten
men
--
or
then
men
and
women
--
could
not
engage
in
a
conspiracy
and
have
it
developed
that
only
five
of
them
were
participants
in
this
substantive
offense.
the
two
you
said
are
all
bound
together.
you
can't
separate
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
there
can't
be
any
offensive
conspiracy
to
commit
the
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
must
consummate
it
in
order
to
have
any
criminal
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
submission
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
if
both
offenses
are
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
jury
can
take
its
choice
but
they
must
--
they're
mutually
exclusive.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
follow
you,
that's
a
different
answer
from
the
one
you
gave
me
at
the
moment
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
analogizing
this
in
a
sense
of
having
a
jury
find
a
man
guilty
of
a
given
crime
and
a
lesser
included
defense
under
the
same
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
evans?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah,
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
of
course,
your
friend
was
saying
that
this
is
analogous.
this
case
is
analogous
to
a
lesser
included
offense
situation.
i
take
it
you'd
want
to
accept
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
becoming
a
little
close
to
the
edges
of
it
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
part
of
the
policy
theory
that
they
were
going
to
leave
the
small
operations
to
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
just
as
easily
have
decided
to
cut
the
line
at
ten.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
suggest
a
hypothetical
to
you
to
pursue
mr.
justice
stewart's
proposition
that
you
might
have
four
innocent
and
one
guilty,
would
this
situation
do
it
if
you
had
a
mountain
resort
up
the
borders
of
nevada
and
four
people
were
hired
and
told
that
it
was
in
nevada
and
that
it
was
perfectly
legal
to
be
running
the
gambling
operation,
being
professional
gamblers
from
las
vegas
or
some
place.
but
the
one
man
who
was
running
the
show
knows
that
it
is
in
whatever
is
an
adjacent
state
which
makes
it
illegal.
what
would
be
the
situation
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it's
pretty
strange
--
it's
pretty
strange
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
if
he
deceived
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
four,
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
mens
rea
are
all
the
parties
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
murder
and
manslaughter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
they
could
punish
for
both
in
one
crime
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
here
we're
talking
about
a
case
i
thought
of
planning
it
and
doing
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
has
said
that
there
are
two
separate
trials.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
evans.
you
have
about
three
minutes
left,
mr.
mclaughlin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
