rehnquist
but
then,
the
rule
you're
contending
for
mr.
mclaughlin
would
be
a
fact,
a
case-by-case
application
rather
than
a
flat
rule
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
took
the
government's
point
to
be
that
if
they
could
demonstrate
some
instances
in
which
wharton's
rule
wouldn't
apply
in
the
administration
of
the
statute,
then
it
shouldn't
apply
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authority
are
you
relying
onto
that
proposition,
that
the
double
jeopardy
forbids
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
wharton
think
that
when
he
evolved
it?
