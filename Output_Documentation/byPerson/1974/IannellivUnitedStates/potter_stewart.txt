justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
that
the
differences
with
maybe
our
constitutional
source.
i
don't
see
that
--
you
haven't
suggested
that
wharton's
rule
has
a
constitutional
source.
the
government
seems
to
feel
it
does.
justice
potter
stewart
a
double
jeopardy
source.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
argue
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
were
asking
us
to
apply
wharton's
rule
just
as
a
matter
of
supervisory
value
or
?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
contention,
mr.
mclaughlin,
that
charges
of
conspiracy
and
of
the
substantive
offense
cannot
be
brought
or
that
the
jury
must
be
instructed
that
they
cannot
find
guilt
of
both
even
if
they
are
brought?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
have,
of
course,
just
to
conspiracy
case
in
the
case
where
the
gambling
operation
was
never
in
fact
set
up.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
have
a
conspiracy
plus
an
overt
act
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
frustration
of
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
would
always
(voice
overlap)
and
that
you
could
have
guilty
--
have
people
guilty
of
conspiracy.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
still
don't
know
that
i
understand
your
answer
to
my
question.
maybe
my
question
isn't
clear.
but
as
i
understand
your
answer,
you
do
not
contend
that
the
prosecutions
cannot
charge
these
people
with
both
the
conspiracy
and
with
the
substantive
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
you
concede
that.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
then
let's
assume
that
the
proof
at
the
trial
shows
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
and
that
there
was
a
commission
of
the
substantive
offense
by
five
or
more
because
five
or
more
people
were
engaged
in
it.
i
don't
mean
there's
evidence
in
rebuttal
of
that,
so
there's
enough
to
go
to
the
jury.
now,
does
the
trial
judge
have
any
duty
in
your
submission
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
may
not
find
the
defendants
guilty
of
both?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
both.
justice
potter
stewart
which
one
must
he
eliminate?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
very
defendant
minded
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
the
conspiracy
is
a
pretty
serious
charge.
generally
because,
it
has
often
been
considered
to
be
more
serious
than
the
substantive
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
this
court
has
often
said
so..
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
would
you
answer
my
question.
it's
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
and
his
instructions
to
the
jury
assuming
people
charged
with
both
conspiracy
and
with
the
substantive
offense
assume
sufficient
evidence
of
both
to
go
to
the
jury.
now,
what
is
the
trial
court's
or
trial
judge's
duty
under
your
submission
under
the
wharton
rule
as
to
his
instructions
to
the
jury?
or
is
it
his
duty
to
dismiss
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution
(voice
overlap)one
or
both
of
the
charges?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
always
one.
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
conspiracy
doesn't
always
result
in
the
substantive
offense
and
the
jury
might
or
might
not
reject
the
incriminating
evidence
with
respect
to
the
substantive
offense.
it
might
hold
if
both
went
to
the
jury
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
but
that
there
was
not
a
substantive
offense,
and
shouldn't
the
jury
be
afraid
as
to
so
hold?(voice
overlap)
would
both
therefore
go
to
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
didn't
know
if
that
was
your
position
or
if
it
was
your
position
that
in
the
event
that
there
were
a
finding
of
guilt
as
to
both,
then
it
became
incumbent
upon
the
district
judge
to
do
something
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
say
what
--
(voice
overlap)
by
his
charge.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
instruction
should
be
that
way
rather
that
you
can't
find
them
guilty
of
both.
you'd
have
to
say
if
you
find
them
guilty
of
the
substantive
offense,
then
you
must
what,
find
him
not
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
not
consider
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
in
with
the
instruction
be
only
if
you
find
him
not
guilty
of
the
substantive
offense
are
you
permitted
to
consider
the
conspiracy
charge?
would
that
be
the
instruction
in
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
want
to
know
what
your
submission
is
here,
that's
all.
justice
potter
stewart
however
that
they're
not
necessarily
mutually
exclusive,
that
there
could
be
a
conspiracy
without
any
evidence
at
all
of
the
element
commission
of
the
substantive
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
only
hypothetical.
there
may
be
no
reported
cases
but
it
certainly
not
an
alice
in
wonderland
idea
that
people
can
plan
to
set
up
a
gambling
operation
and
then
by
reasons
of
death
or
illness
or
competition
or
various
other
reasons,
it
can
be
frustrating
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
a
conspiracy
without
a
substantive
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
mean
that
if
you
had
a
case
where
there
were
exactly
five
people
who
conspired
and
who
were
--
who
then
carried
out
their
conspiracy
by
conducting
a
gambling
operation
then
wharton's
rule
would
be
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
just
with
respect
to
your
point
two?
justice
potter
stewart
this
argument
leads
you
right
into
mr.
mclaughlin's
case,
isn't
it?
you're
saying
that
they're
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying
that
the
substantive
offense
is
basically
the
same
because
they
support
the
same
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
you're
beginning
this
argument
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
evans
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
blackledge
against
perry
last
term?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
pretty
much
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
the
arguments
you're
making
a
moment
or
two
ago.
it's
your
submission
is
it
that
at
least
theoretically,
a
single
individual
could
be
guilty
of
violating
section
1955.
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
would
be
the
only
one
with
“mens
rea”
or
with
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
and
he
could
--
he
would
hire
four
more,
people
who
just
didn't
know
what
was
going
on
upstairs,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
receiving
stolen
property
and
the
conviction
for
both
and
for
larceny.
