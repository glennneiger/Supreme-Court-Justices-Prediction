justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
nature
of
the
possessory
warrant
in
georgia
law,
i
am
not
familiar
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
there
is
a
difference
purpose
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
there
it
has
a
different
purpose
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
--
does
garnishment
really
alter
the
possession
of
property.
well,
what
kind
of
a
property
right
you
conceive
that
you
client
had
against
the
bank.
he
wasn't
entitled
to
so
many
particular
bills,
was
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
under
georgia
law?
i
mean,
supposing
that
the
bank
went
into
receivership
and
went
bankrupt,
your
claim
wouldn't
be
regarded
as
a
trust
--
trustee
fund
claim,
would
it,
it's
just
an
ordinary
debt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
might
be
covered
through
insurance,
but
typically
a
depositor's
claim
against
a
bank
isn't
property
in
the
sense
of
having
a
right
to
a
particular
group
of
bills
in
the
banks,
well
it's
a
show,
it's
an
action,
it's
a
contract.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
nothing
was
transferred
by
this
really
garnishment,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
wrong
with
the
supreme
court
of
georgia's
analogy
in
this
case,
that
it
is
like
a
lis
pendens
on
property,
that
prevents
you
from
using
the
property,
but
it
doesn't
transfer
possession
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
these
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
when
you
speak
of
not
being
able
to
use
this
money,
you
can't
use
it
by
putting
up
the
bond,
can't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
for
a
wage
garnishment,
when
you
are
talking
about
disillusion
after
10
days,
that
probably
means
two
pay
dates.
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
after
10
days
you
give
back
the
money
held
during
those
two
pay
days,
it
just
means
it
doesn't
apply
beyond
10
days,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
your
case,
i
take
it
once
your
bank
account
is
garnished,
you
don't
go
on
depositing
money
in
there,
you
get
a
new
bank
account.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
i
would
hope?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
might
be
evidence
of
harassment
or
attempt
of
add
leverage,
if
they
have
enough
tied
up
to
satisfy
their
claim,
i
would
presume
they
wouldn't
do
any
more?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
coppedge,
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
you
as
to
the
infirmities
of
the
present
georgia
statute
and
that
georgia
legislature
wanted
to
go
back
and
try
to
make
some
constitutional
provision
whereby
a
plaintiff
in
a
case
like
this
suing
an
out
of
state
corporation
could
get
some
sort
of
security
that
would
ultimately
satisfy
a
judgment
if
it
got
it,
what
could
the
legislature
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
hearing
prior
to
the
attachment
is
useless,
if
you've
got
a
debtor
with
a
tendency
to
abscond,
he
won't
have
any
money
in
the
bank,
the
minute
he
gets
notice
of
the
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
there
could
be
some
sort
of
seizure
prior
to
the
hearing
on
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
the
board
has
done
is
a
different
division
of
clerk
here
and
a
judge
in
the
case
posited
by
justice
white.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
elements
of
damages
on
an
action
on
the
bond
in
georgia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
only
thing
you
can
recover
is
the
cost
of
defense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
damages
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
coppedge,
what
the
superior
court
(inaudible)
was
to
refuse
to
dissolve
the
garnishment,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
dismiss
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
up
held
that
rule.
now
if
we
were
to
reverse
that,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
our
reversal
on
the
liability
on
the
bond?
