mr.
coppedge,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
but
if
you
had
debts
outstanding,
would
it
be
any
different
on
your
balance
sheet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
condition
of
your
balance
sheet
is
very
crucial
to
this
kind
of
a
case,
but
the
fact
is,
honest
accounting
would
require
you
to
show
some
kind
of
a
contingency
liability
based
upon
the
maximum
possible
claim
that
might
be
established
against
you,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
sure
your
accountant
will
unquestionably
tell
you,
you
better
put
something
in
your
statements
if
you
are
issuing
the
statement
through
a
bank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
subject
to
an
interlocutory
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn't
there
be
an
inherent
power
in
the
court
to
issue
an
order
to
trim
it
down
to
enough
to
give
you
your
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
