mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
presented
to
the
court
today
is
a
garnishment
action
involving
title
46,
section
101,
that
(inaudible)
of
the
code
of
georgia,
which
provides
for
prejudgment
garnishment
by
a
plaintiff
upon
the
defendant's
bank
account
without
notice
to
the
defendant.
the
authority
for
our
position
before
this
court
today
is
contained
in
this
court's
decisions
in
sniadach,
fuentes
versus
shevin,
and
mitchell
versus
w.
t.
grant
company.
we
also
consider
the
authority
of
boddie
versus
connecticut,
at
401
us
371,
to
be
especially
applicable
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
the
facts
are,
that
on
august
the
20,
1971,
di-chem
inc.
filed
a
suit
on
account
against
north
georgia
finishing,
and
concurrently
therewith,
an
intermediate
sequential
order,
filed
a
garnishment
action,
and
served
its
summons
of
garnishment
upon
the
first
national
bank
of
dalton,
in
georgia.
and
the
summons
of
garnishment,
was
issued
by
a
clerk
of
the
court.
it
was
based
only
upon
the
conclusory
allegation,
that
the
plaintiff
had
reason
to
apprehend
the
loss
of
a
sum
of
money
or
a
part
thereof
in
the
process
of
garnishment
issue.
the
summons
required
the
garnishee
to
answer
in
not
less
than
30,
no
more
than
45
days,
all
of
the
property
that
it
had
at
the
time
service
belonging
to
the
defendant,
and
all
of
the
property
that
might
have
come
into
his
possession
in
the
interim
and
this
is
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
all
of
the
property
may
have
more
or
less
than
were
as
sued
for,
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
exactly
parallel
to
the
statute,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
a
printed
allegation
supplied
to
people,
by
the
local
printing
industry
in
courts
and
you
may
be
filling
the
blanks.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir.
nothing
is
wrong
with
it.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
insofar
as
form,
nothing
is
wrong
with
that.
now,
the
georgia
practice
as
stated
in
powell
versus
powell,
at
95
georgia
appeals
122
provides
that
a
defendant
in
such
a
case
is
not
even
a
party
to
the
case,
and
is
not
entitled
to
any
notice
either
pre-seizure
or
post-seizure,
he
is
just
not
a
party
to
the
case,
until
he
posts
bond.
in
this
case,
north
georgia
finishing
posted
bond,
as
soon
as
the
courthouse
opened
after
the
weekend
was
over,
the
garnishment
was
issued
on
friday
afternoon,
and
in
doing
so
freeze
its
bank
account.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
he's
a
party
to
the
main
action,
but
he's
not
a
party
to
this
action.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
the
main
action
continues
to
pend,
and
it
must
be
filed
prior
to
the
garnishment
action.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
immediate
preceding
sequentially
filed
case.
and
then,
north
georgia
finishing
posted
its
bond
to
do
two
things.
one
is,
to
substitute
property,
that
is
to
substitute
a
bond
for
its
bank
account,
which
was
a
commercial
bank
account,
and
which
had
been
tied
up
by
virtue
of
the
garnishment
and
secondly,
under
the
authority
of
the
georgia
codes,
it
posted
bond
in
order
to
gain
access
to
the
court,
in
order
to
establish
standing.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir
and
there
is
no
statutory
provision
provided
by
georgia
law
for
either
a
pre-seizure
hearing
or
a
post-seizure
hearing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
have
no
standing
in
the
case,
until
we
post
a
bond
and
this
is
why,
we
think
the
authority
of
boddie
versus
connecticut
to
be
especially
applicable
because
if
we
understand
in
that
case,
it
says
that
access
to
the
courts
shall
not
be
a
function
of
a
financial
requirement.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir,
there
was
a
hearing
before
the
trial
judge.
there
were
allegations
in
the
motion
to
set
aside
that
the
affidavit
was
granted;
however,
there
was
nothing
heard
on
that
particular
allegation.
we
do
not
consider
that
we
have
a
authority
under
the
georgia
statute
to
a
cert.
there
was
an
allegation
in
our
motion
to
set
aside
the
garnishment.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
don't
think
it
had
any
of
them.
there
was
nothing
presented
and
there
was
no
evidence
presented.
we
merely
argued
that
this
case
is
--
this
court's
sniadach
opinion.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir,
my
client
is
not
in
business
as
north
georgia
finishing
company
any
longer.
it
changed
its
name
to
beavercreek
carpet
mills
inc
to
more
correctly
reflects
its
nature
of
business
and
that
is
the
general
manufacturing
of
carpet
rather
than
carpet
finishing.
it
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
beavercreek
mills
inc.
which
is
a
subsidiary
of
another
company.
they
are
no
longer
active
in
manufacturing
and
selling
carpet,
but
they
are
still
a
corporate
entity
and
still
in
existence.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
the
underlying
litigation
is
still
pending,
there
is
no
hearing
on
it.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
our
purpose
today,
may
it
please
the
court
is
not
necessarily
to
rehash
the
written
briefs
previously
filed
but
there
have
there
a
number
of
recent
cases,
following
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
the
mitchell
versus
w.
t.
grant,
case.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
speaking
for
the
court.
we
would
take
an
opportunity
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
several
of
those
cases
that
have
flowed
from
this
court's
opinion
in
mitchell
versus
w.t.
grant,
and
we
would
take
this
opportunity
to
state
that
we
are
in
agreement
with
all
that
we
have
found.
the
first
is
a
case
of
september
4,
1974
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
it's
a
case
of
roberts
versus
macaulay
at
232
georgia
660.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir,
they
are
not,
they
are
subsequent
cases.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
roberts
versus
macaulay,
232
georgia
660
wherein
justice
hall
speaking
for
the
sixth
of
the
seven
justices
of
that
court
quoted
with
approval
mitchell
versus
w.t.
grant,
and
stated
that
the
one
overriding
constitutional
problem
presented
by
the
georgia
possessory
warrant
statute
which
was
the
statute
under
consideration
in
that
case,
was
the
absence
of
judicial
control
over
the
institution
of
the
proceedings
which
could
be
begun
by
application
to
the
court
clerk.
in
this
case,
in
the
garnishment
case
before
this
court,
it
was
commenced
by
application
to
a
court
clerk.
in
this
case
of
roberts
versus
macaulay,
the
court
recognized
the
fuentes
decision
of
this
court
which
it
did
not
recognize
when
we
were
before
that
court.
it
declare
the
georgia
possessory
warrant
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so
and
i
don't
--
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir,
they
did
not
deal
with
fuentes
when
we
were
before
that
court.
they
dealt
with
a
case
of
american
olean
tile
co.
versus
zimmerman,
hawaiian
case
and
cited
that
as
their
authority.
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
has
declared
non-notice
seizures
of
bank
accounts
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir.
that
was
pre
mitchell,
in
the
case
of
brunswick
corporation
versus
galaxy
cocktail
lounge
at
513
pacific
2nd
1390.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
brunswick
corporation
versus
galaxy
cocktail
lounge
inc.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
possessory
warrants
in
georgia
were
first
enacted
in
1822
and
were
a
means
of
summarily
bestowing
possession
of
run
away
slaves.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
pardon.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
well,
runaway
slaves
or
other
property,
and
it
has
been
applied
to
other
property
since
1865.
now
it
is
no
different
in
effect
from
the
provisions
of
the
garnishment
statute
in
that
and
it
alters
possession
of
property
pending
suit
and
prior
to
hearing.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
our
position
is
that
this
particular
piece
of
property,
and
this
is
one
of
the
reason
we
feel
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
mitchell
case,
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
money
in
the
bank.
the
bank
is
--
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
suppose
we'd
have
to
look
at
the
fdic,
decision
power
to
--
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
it's
a
creditor
debtor
relationship.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
have
a
right
under
our
contract
with
that
bank
to
make
use
of
the
funds
that
we
have
deposited
in
that
bank,
and
if
the
deprivation
of
the
use
of
the
funds,
the
use
is
the
only
purpose
to
which
bank
accounts
and
money
can
be
put
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
lis
pendens
in
georgia
pertains
only
to
a
situation
where
there
are
equities
and
the
property.
number
one,
lis
pendens
cannot
be
asserted
in
georgia,
unless
an
equitable
claim
of
title
is
asserted
against
property.
secondly,
lis
pendens
leaves
the
property
and
the
use
and
possession
of
that
person
against
whom
the
lis
pendens
writ
is
filed.
lis
pendens
is
applicable
in
our
opinion
only
to
a
real-estate,
or
perhaps
to
a
mechanic's
type
lien,
laborer's
lien,
material
men's
lien
wherein
that
property
is
left
in
the
possession,
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
contended
debtor
and
only
can
be
issued
in
an
equitable
situation,
and
there
are
several
cases
on
that
point,
watson
versus
whatley
at
218
georgia
86.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir.
yes
sir,
they
are,
they
are
footnoted
in
the
brief,
excuse
me.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
in
that
instance,
all
we
have
done
is
substituted
one
form
of
our
property
with
another,
and
we
believe
that
this
court's
opinion
in
the
fuentes
case,
where
it's
indicated
that
we've
been
deprived
of
our
property
and
we
are
still
deprived
of
our
property,
because
that
bond
shows
up
on
our
corporate
financial
statement
as
a
binding
obligation
of
the
corporation.
all
we've
done
is
substituted
the
types
of
property
that
we
have
been
deprived.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
sir,
this
debt
is
very
much
a
contested
debt,
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
principle
use
of
prejudgment
garnishments
in
georgia
are
as
an
economic
bludgeon
to
either
for
settlement
on
more
favorable
terms
or
surrender.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
certainly
we
do
have
to
properly
account
and
post
our
balance
sheets,
but
if
we
honestly
contend
that
we
don't
owe
anybody
any
money,
and
we
are
sued
for
this
money
on
open
account,
i
think
i
am
not
familiar
with
accounting
practices
enough
to
say,
well,
now
we
have
got
to
show
that,
accept
as
a
contingent
liability
under
suits,
somewhere
else
--
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
and
the
statement
which
are
concerning
contingent
liability
and
litigation,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
list
it
in
the
assets
and
liabilities
of
the
corporation,
that
it
is
an
acknowledged
debt.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i've
had
a
case
where
that
was
done,
and
i
used
this
evidence
against
these
debtors.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
had
a
finishing
house,
it
had
a
carpet
mill
and
it
had
a
bank
account.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
am
sure
they
were.
i
would
state
to
the
court
that
there
were,
but
i
have
no
independent
knowledge
of
that.
but
i
am
certain
that
they
were
real
state
mortgages,
and
i
am
certain
that
they
were
factoring
contracts
with
various
of
the
factoring
incorporations.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir,
there
was
no
proof
one
way
or
the
other.
to
answer
your
honor's
question
in
a
little
more
detail,
we
believe
that
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
the
fuentes
case
that
due
process
test
should
be
based
upon
the
merits
of
the
case,
and
not
upon
the
relative
financial
strength
of
the
parties.
at
page
1996
fuentes
states
clearly,
that
the
bond
has
no
replacement
for
due
process
hearing
before
a
neutral
hearing
officer,
with
discretion
and
knows
that
a
bond
merely
replaces
one
piece
of
property
with
another,
and
does
nothing
to
advance
the
cause
of
due
process.
we
agree
with
the
court
in
that
decision,
that
a
bond
offers
only
minimal
protection
and
we
know
that
the
deprivation
is
for
30
to
45
days,
of
all
of
the
property
which
that
bank
was
have
in
its
possession
on
deposit
from
our
company,
and
it
is
not
limited
with
--
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
it
just
doesn't
address
the
issue
of
fairness
and
due
process.
it
doesn't
establish
as
the
mitchell
case
test
required,
as
we
read
the
mitchell
case
that
there
must
be
some
judicial
officer
with
discretion
to
issue
this
seizure
warrant,
that
there
must
be
some
facts
stated
upon
ways
to
base
the
seizure
warrant,
that
there
must
be
some
reasonable
hearing,
following
the
issuance
of
the
seizure
warrant.
none
of
the
these
things
are
provided
for
in
the
georgia
statutory
scheme.
further,
we
think
that
the
mitchell
decision
is
support
for
our
position
before
this
court
in
that
the
mitchell
decision
limits
itself
or
partly
limits
itself
to
property
wherein
both
the
debtor
and
the
creditor
have
a
legal
and
equitable
interest,
that
is
by
virtue
of
title
retention
contract.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
think
not
for
this
reason.
the
wisconsin
statute
as
i
understand
it,
number
one,
you
did
not
have
to
post
the
bond
to
gain
access
to
the
courts
as
you
do
in
georgia.
number
two,
in
wisconsin
the
garnishment
automatically
dissolved
after
10
days.
there
is
no
such
disillusion
feature
in
georgia.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
your
honor
of
that.
i
am
not
sure,
and
i
did
not
consider
that
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
certainly
hope.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
they
will
go
after
any
other
bank
account
i
have.
all
they
have
to
do
is
issue
new
summons.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
you
don't
know
your
honor,
for
30
days,
and
it
couldn't
be
considerably
more
that
they
have
tied
up.
they
can
tie
up
$200,000
on
a
$100,000
bond,
and
that's
what's
in
the
bank.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
it,
and
in
practice
i
will
call
another
lawyer
up
and
say,
hey,
you
got
too
much,
how
about
reducing?
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
know
of
no
such
order
ever
having
been
issued
in
my
practice,
and
i
know
that
i
have
not
made
an
application,
i
have
done
it
informally
with
counsel.
i
would
call
two
other
cases
to
the
court's
attention.
first
is
a
case
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
texas
and
it's
cited
at
43
law
week
20-120
garcia
versus
klaus
(ph)
wherein
that
court
held
the
texas
statute
which
appears
to
be
parallel
to
the
georgia
statute
in
material
part
unconstitutional
following
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
mitchell
case
and
also
a
three-judge
court
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
sugar
versus
curtis
circulation
company
at
43
law
week
2183,
which
also
followed
the
mitchell
opinion
of
this
court
and
held
a
georgia
statue
--
held
a
new
york
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
have
no
objection
whatsoever
and
so
stated
in
my
brief
that
we
do
not
oppose
what
we
consider
to
be
this
court's
attempt
to
reach
a
constitutional
accommodation
between
the
rights
of
debtors
and
the
rights
creditors
by
providing
some
safeguard
either
immediately
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
attachment,
or
the
right
of
hearing
after
the
attachment.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
your
honor,
i
said
either,
and
i
think
that
the
court
could
issue
an
interlocutory
order
requiring
property
under
injunction
to
be
held
for
three
to
four
days,
so
we
could
have
a
hearing.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
absolutely,
absolutely.
we
think
that
there
should
be
a
constitutional
accommodation
somewhere,
but
a
clerk
issuing
a
seizure
upon
conclusions
without
either
any
pre-seizure
or
a
post
seizure
hearing,
just
doesn't
measure
up
in
our
opinion.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir,
i
think
–
i
think.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir,
if
it's
properly
issued
under
proper
control
and
safeguard.
i
am
claiming
that
we
can
be
bludgeoned
economically
by
interrupting
the
commercial
course
of
business.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
we
think
that
is
one
of
the
basic
reasons.
the
other
is
the
fact
that
it's
issued
upon
conclusory
allegations
without
saying
anything.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
a
devastating
-
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
well,
but
the
condition
of
the
bond
is
not
to
pay
any
in
double.
the
condition
of
the
bond
is
only
to
pay
what
money
i
am
out
in
defending
it.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
if
he
has
a
professional
bonding
company,
if
he
gets
a
vice
president
of
the
company
to
sign
the
bond
as
he
did
in
this
case,
it
doesn't.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
only
to
pay
what
money
you
are
out
in
defending
the
bond,
should
i
appear
that
it
should
not
have
been
issued.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
all
damages,
which
in
my
opinion,
don't
go
to
double
the
bond;
they
go
to
whatever
you
can
show
you
are
out.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
there
is
no
penalty.
if
whatever
i
can
prove,
maybe
i
can
prove
interest
expense,
maybe
i
can
prove
my
lawyer's
but
there
is
not
a
penalty,
it's
not
a
punitive
bond,
and
it's
certainly
not
--
won't
go
double
the
bond,
it
won't
even
go
to
the
principal
obligation.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
insist
that
a
judge
issue
the
sequestration
warrant
and
not
a
clerk.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
insist
that
the
least,
that
the
ex
parte
before
judge
who
exercises
discretion,
and
hears
something
other
than
a
conclusion,
i
don't
insist
that
i
have
to
be
present.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
thank
you!
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
mr.
justice
i
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
because
of
this
situation
in
georgia
created
not
only
that
--
well,
the
morrow
electric
case
but
also
aaron
versus
clark,
342
f.
supp.
898,
we
have
jury
rigged,
a
situation
whereby
if
we
want
to
restrain
property
we
contend
under
the
georgia
general
equity
statues
that
we
have
no
adequate
legal
remedy
that
because
of
the
conflict
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts,
we
have
no
adequately
legal
remedy.
we
take
our
client
in,
we
swear
him
in
before
the
judge
he
testifies
and
the
court
issues
an
ex
parte
injunction
requiring
the
defendant
to
to
appear
in
a
very
short
time
and
show
cause
and
we
think
that
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
should
render
this
to
dignity
of
statute.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
we
don't
have
--
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
because
without
it
we
don't
have
a
fair
system
of
sequestering
property.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
the
superior
court
of
whitfield
country
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
case.
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
the
application
--
the
garnishment
case
on
the
constitutional
grounds
asserted
which
at
the
time
was
--
mr.
warren
n.
coppedge,
jr.
i
think
that
there
would
be
no
liability
on
the
bond
because
the
liability,
the
condition
of
bond
as
set
forth
on
the
appendix
which
your
honor
has
before
you
is
to
pay
such
judgment
as
may
be
rendered
in
this
case
and
that
refers
to
the
garnishment
case.
in
georgia
what
you
do
is
you
get
a
judgment
in
your
main
case
and
then
if
it's
not
paid
then
you
go
sue
the
other
case.
and
they
have
not
perused
the
main
case
and
there
is
a
counter
claim
pending
in
the
main
case
and
i
assume
that
would
be
pursued
later.
thank
you.
