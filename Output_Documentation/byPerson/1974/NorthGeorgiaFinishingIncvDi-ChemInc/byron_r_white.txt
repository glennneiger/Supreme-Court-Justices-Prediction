you
are
not
claiming

if
there
is
a

here,
you
are
not

pre-judgment

but
if
the
judge
-â€“
if
the
creditor
went
to
a

with
a
piece
of
paper
and
swore
before
the
judge
of
these
facts
and
the

thought
that

do
you

between

people

creditors,
you

your

well,
it

this
is
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
sustaining
the
georgia
prejudgment
garnishment
statute.
that
law
permits
a
creditor
suing
his
debtor
to
attach
and
put
beyond
use
during
the
litigation
certain
property
of
the
debtor
in
the
hands
of
third
persons.
this
was
done
by
serving
on
a
third
person
a
writ
of
garnishment
issued
by
a
court
clerk
ex
parte
and
at
the
behest
of
the
creditor
all
without
notice
or
hearing
and
without
participation
by
a
judicial
officer.
as
explained
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
it
is
the
court's
view
that
georgia
statute
is
invalid
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
failed
to
take
account
of
this
court's
decision
in
fuentes
against
shevin
in
407
u.s.
and
that
the
later
decision
in
mitchell
against
grant
does
not
save
the
georgia
procedure.
accordingly,
the
judgment
below
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
concurring
statement.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
joined
and
in
paragraph
5
of
which
the
chief
justice
joins.
