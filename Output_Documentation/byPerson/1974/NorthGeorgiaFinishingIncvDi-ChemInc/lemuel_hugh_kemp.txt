mr.
lemuel
hugh
kemp
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
end
when
the
clock
sounds.
i
have
my
family
here
and
i
have
to
take
them
back
on
a
train
tonight,
but
i
think
i
can
cover
the
essential
points.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
take
up
three
points
rely
on
my
brief
on
my
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
statute.
the
first
is,
as
indicated
by
mr.
justice
powell,
we
think
that
waiver
rights,
the
garnishment
issued,
they
file
the
bond,
not
to
create
a
stand-in,
but
to
free
up
this
bank
account.
three
weeks
later,
as
an
after
thought,
after
having
read
a
little
law
perhaps,
they
came
in
and
filed
an
assault
and
an
under
attack
in
paragraph
11,
to
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell.
paragraph
3,
said,
if
plaintiff
had
no
reason
to
apprehend
the
loss
of
any
judgment.
then
three
weeks,
after
they
filed
the
bond,
not
to
create
stand-in
but
to
free
the
bank
account,
they
came
in
and
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
complete
and
a
full
hearing
of
any
kind
and
at
their
instance
it
was
heard
and
judge
(inaudible)
of
superior
court
entered
an
order
in
which
he
denied
each
and
every
of
the
grounds
on
page
10
and
11
in
the
appendix
of
the
north
georgia's
brief.”
so
we
say
they
waived
any
rights.
secondly
they
had
many
other
ways
which
could
have
attacked.
the
main
action
was
removed
to
federal
court,
although
they
could
have
filed
a
separate
suit
in
federal
court.
they
could
have
filed
an
inter-plea,
they
could
have
filed
a
declaratory
judgment,
they
could
raised
it
in
many
different
issues.
the
reason
they
filed
the
bond
was
to
free
the
bank
account.
our
second
point
is
that
under
the
authority
of
defunis
versus
odegaard,
the
issue
is
a
moot,
first
because
they
filed
the
bond.
once
they
filed
the
bond
under
georgia
law,
roberts
versus
(inaudible)
the
dissolution
bond
takes
the
place
of
the
property
or
the
fund
garnished.
there
is
no
issue
anymore,
it's
moot,
just
as
when
the
law
student
graduated,
the
issue
out
of
washington
and
oregon
became
mute.
secondly,
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
an
argument
of
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
plant
is
solvent
or
not,
but
i
respectfully
submit
and
stating
my
place
that
what
has
happened
is
exactly
what
mr.
foster
said
when
he
filled
out
this
affidavit.
the
defendants
will
not
be
forthcoming
to
answer
the
garnishment
and
we
submit
that
if
the
court
does
want
to
make
an
inquiry,
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
the
insolvency
of
the
debtor
if
it
in
fact
existed
would
make
the
garnishment
moot.
thirdly,
and
the
third
point
is,
we
make
the
point
in
our
brief
that
the
georgia
statute
and
your
honors,
i
frankly
have
inquired
into
the
various
areas
of
--
and
i'll
cover
in
my
brief
is
constitutional
and
we
distinguish,
if
we
think
(inaudible)
and
(inaudible)
the
mitchell
decision
and
the
recent
decision
in
the
last
week
of
the
court,
upon
seizure
of
automobiles
and
similar
recent
cases
which
i
don't
have
cited
in
my
brief
because
it
came
down
after
the
brief
was
typed.
the
main
point
i
want
to
make
otherwise
is
that
even
if
this
court
should
reach
mr.
coppedge's
conclusion
and
assertion
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
required
to
provide
notice
that
it
should
not
be
applied
to
retroactively.
this
case
was
filed
in
august
1971.
sniadach
had
been
decided,
but
it's
certainly
it
didn't
presage
fuentes,
that
was
limited
to
specialized
wages.
fuentes
had
not
been
decided
when
the
case
would
argued
in
the
trial
court
in
december
1971,
and
when
trial
court
had
issued
its
order.
under
the
case
of
linkletter
versus
walker
cited
in
our
case,
another
case
was
cited
in
our
brief,
this
court
had
held
that
it
will
not
apply
retroactively,
so
as
to
dislodge
established
reliance
on
a
statute.
most
recently
in
the
case
of
lemon
versus
kurtzman
which
involved
the
pennsylvania
state,
reimbursing
sectarian
schools,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
statue
had
been
declared
unconstitutional,
the
court
refused
to
apply
the
statue
or
the
unconstitutional
holding
that.
in
that
case
the
court
stated
statutory
or
even
judge
made
rules
of
law
of
hard
facts
on
which
people
must
rely
in
making
decisions.
this
fact
of
legal
life
underpins
our
modern
decisions
recognizing
a
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity.
so
we
say
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
respectfully
submit,
we
don't
think
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
we
don't
think
that
you
should
ever
reach
the
issue,
because
of
waiver
and
because
of
mootness,
but
even
if
you
do
reach
it
and
agree
with
counsel
for
petitioner,
we
respectfully
submit
di-chem
is
relying
on
it.
the
only
thing
that
they
have
got
is
this
bond
now,
if
they
don't
get
into
claim
that
there
was
no
holding
or
poor
shuddering
of
fuentes,
and
therefore
it
would
be
inapplicable
and
under
this
court's
doctrine
as
stated
in
the
kurtzman
case
and
in
the
walker
and
linkletter
case
that
if
the
court
does
reach
a
conclusion
that
the
georgia
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
any
reason
whatever,
that
it
should
be
given
prospective
application
only
and
it
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
di-chem's
right
to
get
to
stick
to
$51000
and
i'm
not
sure
that
even
the
bond
is
solving
it
at
this
time
because
of
various
and
sundry
things
that
have
gone
in
these
corporations
but
at
least
we
respectfully
to
submit
that
we
should
have
our
right
to
go
after
north
georgia
and
after
his
bondsman.
mr.
lemuel
hugh
kemp
we've
been
waiting
to
see
what
the
ultimate
outcome
is
going
to
be
and
whether
it's
going
to
be
bond
available.
if
there
is
no
bond
available,
we
own
this
case
on
the
contingencies
on
a
side,
we
have
got
about
three-four
hundred
hours
unless
there
is
a
bond
available
there
was
no
use
to
going
ahead
and
trying
the
main
action
because
that
would
just
eat
up
more
judicial
time
and
more
effort.
mr.
lemuel
hugh
kemp
i
don't
really
know.
as
far
as
i
know
in
atlanta
i
can't
understand
it.
if
i
want
to
issue
a
garnishment
in
atlanta,
i
have
no
problem.
of
course
our
superior
court
judge
will
not
let
us
issue
one.
he
follows
the
suggestion
in
some
ways
as
suggested
by
justice
rehnquist.
we
go
over
with
an
order
and
say
and
take
our
client
with
us
and
swear
him
in
and
say
that
they
are
going
to
run
off
with
this
money.
your
honor,
if
you
don't
issue
this
garnishment,
he
issues
a
garnishment
and
gives
them
three
days
to
show
why
it
shouldn't
be
dissolved.
mr.
lemuel
hugh
kemp
to
my
knowledge
yes,
that's
the
practice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
guptill
(ph)
who
thought
of
this
procedure
where
we
could
keep
on
[attempt
to
laughter]
where
we
could
keep
on
tying
up
people's
money.
mr.
lemuel
hugh
kemp
just
policy,
it's
usually
on
any
kind
of
a
–
on
that
type
of
judgment.
we
have
a
three
days
to
show
cause
and
on
that
point
a
wife
can
tying
up
a
man's
property
by
filing
a
suit
and
if
he
is
got
a
plant
amounting
to
three
million
dollars,
he's
got
everything
he
has
got
tied
up
right
now
with
a
lis
pendens
in
a
divorce
action
and
she
wants
it
all,
we
can't
sell
it,
we
can't
borrow
on
it,
we
can't
sell
our
stock.
so
a
lis
pendens
is
a
pretty
effective
though;
i
have
(inaudible)
your
honor.
