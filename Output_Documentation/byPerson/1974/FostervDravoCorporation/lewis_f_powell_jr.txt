f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
just
curious
mr.
sachse.
i
gather
this
being
selective
service
act
is
only
for
a
conscripted
army.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
how
about
to
new
volunteers?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
does?
to
new
volunteer
army?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
might
say
military
selective
service
act
is
a
little
misleading,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
that
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it
didn't
apply
to
the
volunteer
army,
this
would
be
rather
just
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
it's
a
statute
if
the
decision
here
is
to
apply
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
shoop,
are
you
suggesting
when
you
mentioned
insurance
benefits
that
if
a
veteran
would
die
in
service,
he'd
be
entitled
to
participate
in
the
company's
group
insurance
program?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
mr.
shoop,
what
happens
with
an
employee
who
does
not
go
into
the
military
service
but
who
in
1967,
whatever
reason
worked
only
20
weeks,
in
1968,
worked
only
15
weeks
but
then
he
comes
to
1969,
he
works
52
weeks,
how
do
you
compute
his
vacation
earned
for
1970?
