mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
question
presented
by
the
case
is
whether
a
requirement
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
an
employee
work
not
less
than
25
weeks
in
the
prior
year
to
receive
a
vacation
can
be
used
to
prevent
a
returning
veteran
from
receiving
a
vacation
in
the
year
of
his
return
and
in
the
year
after
his
return.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
company
could
deny
vacations
to
the
veteran
for
failure
to
meet
this
25-work
week
requirement,
it's
our
position
that
this
interpretation
keeps
a
veteran
from
returning
to
his
employment
without
loss
of
seniority
status
or
pay
and
it's
in
contravention
of
50
u.s.c.
459,
the
selective
service
act.
i've
had
a
chart
passed
around
which
i've
also
supplied
to
opposing
counsel
which
i'll
turn
to
in
a
minute
and
i
think
will
help
clarify
the
--
what
really
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it's
only
illustrative.
that's
correct.
i've
decided
to
use
instead
of
a
big
display
that
seemed
unwieldy.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
we
argue
that
a
continuing
escalator
principle
should
apply
in
this
case.
the
contract
in
question
has
a
25-work
week
requirement
but
as
to
veterans,
this
is
all
that
the
contract
says,
this
is
on
--
in
the
appendix
page
48.
it
says,
“an
employee
inducted
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
shall
be
given
the
minimum
re-employment
rights
granted
him
under
the
selective
service
act
as
amended.
so
the
question
then
is
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
that's
not
so.
it
applies
to
--
to
reserve
units
and
it
applies
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
--
to
volunteers
in
the
army.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
it
does.
yes
it
does.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
there
are
different
sections
of
the
act
but
they
apply
the
exact
same
rule.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
and
the
act
was
passed
in
1941
with
the
idea
that
a
lot
of
people
would
be
volunteering
and
not
just
that
and
to
encourage
people
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
their
limits
on
how
many
years
if
applies
drafted
i
think
its
two
years
volunteer
to
something,
i
don't
recall
the
details
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
are
limits
there
and
there
are
also
limits
on
how
quickly
you
have
to
re-apply
within
90
days
of
being
released
after
you
apply
to
the
same.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well
that
cites
at
10
on
the
appendix
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
its
part
of
that
act
but
it
--
but
it
covers
more
than
that.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
want
to
make
a
definite
statement
on
that.
the
act
applies
--
the
act
applies
to
more
than
just
draft.
i
know
it
applies
to
reserve
units.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
it's
really,
it's
just.
it's
useless
for
me
to
speculate
about
whether
it
applies
in
a
pure
volunteer
situation.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
it
does
apply
to
this
employee.
now,
if
you
turn
to
the
chart,
i'll
show
you
what
happens
with
this
employee
and
it's
a
fairly
typical
situation.
he
went
to
work
on
august
5th,
extreme
left
of
the
chart.
during
the
first
22
weeks,
he
received
no
vacation.
during
the
next
year,
he
received
a
vacation
of
approximately
three
days
based
on
the
amount
of
work
in
the
prior
year
under
provision
that
is
only
there
for
initial
employees.
during
the
next
year,
he
had
served
enough,
so
that
he
was
a
full-fledged
employee
getting
regular
vacation
pay
which
would
--
which
is
seven
days.
so,
they
get
even
in
the
third
year
but
during
that
third
year,
he
went
into
the
army,
into
the
navy
actually.
he
begins
almost
two
years
of
military
service.
he's
paid
when
he
goes
into
the
navy.
his
vacation
benefits
are
earned
up
to
that
point.
so,
we
have
no
quarrel
about
old
--
about
benefits
prior
to
that
date.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
on
march
6,
1967
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
--
he
begins
his
military
service
and
he's
paid
56
hours
of
vacation
benefit.
now,
let
me
just
proceed
and
i
think
you
will
follow
me.
he
then
is
in
navy
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
or
almost
two
years.
when
he
returns,
he
gets
no
vacation
benefit,
no
vacation
at
all
during
that
first
13-week
period
and
he
gets
no
vacation
during
the
entire
next
year
under
this
contract.
it's
full
work
year
and
the
result
for
that
first
of
all,
to
put
it
in
some
simplified
way
but
i
think
this
is
what
the
act
is
really
about
from
his
standpoint
because
he
went
into
the
service.
his
having
to
go
through
the
whole
business
of
being
a
rookie
again
of
having
a
year
and
a
half
before
he
works
up
to
getting
a
vacation
again.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
less
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
he
doesn't
even
get
the
pro
rata
that
a
rookie
would
get.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
now,
the
company
says
that
this
is
just
a
straight
application
of
the
contract
because
in
these
13
weeks,
when
he
came
back,
he
hadn't
serve
25
weeks
in
the
prior
year,
then
in
the
full
year,
when
he
comes
back,
he
hadn't
serve
25
weeks
at
the
plant
in
that
year
and
so
this
is
the
way
the
contract
works.
now,
our
position
to
really
just
get
to
the
heart
of
it
right
at
the
beginning,
our
position
is
that
where
a
company
bases
its
vacation
benefits
on
a
work
requirement
such
as
25
weeks
in
a
year
which
is
just
half
of
the
year's
work,
but
what
they're
really
doing
the
way
the
employee
see
it
and
the
real
effect
of
what
they're
doing
is
saying
that
a
person
who's
a
steady
employee
of
the
company,
who's
there
working
every
year,
gets
a
vacation
every
year,
after
he's
gone
through
his
initial
period
and
that
under
this
court's
decision
on
the
selective
service
act
and
under
the
language
of
the
act.
this
is
part
of
seniority
and
status,
of
longevity
in
the
company
and
when
he
comes
back,
he
shouldn't
be
required
to
sit
there
and
re-earn
his
right
to
a
vacation.
he
should
start
getting
vacations
the
year
he
comes
back
to
work
for
the
company
and
certainly,
i
can
see
problems
in
the
first
year
where
he
can
play
around,
that
he
worked
just
three
weeks
that
year,
that
he
worked
almost
the
whole
year
but
here,
even
in
the
second
year,
he
received
no
vacation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
it
goes
up
depending
on
how
many
years
he's
been
in
employment.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
and
the
company
is
not
dispute
that
the
way
of
figuring
the
maximum
vacation
is
continuous
and
he
would
get
credit
for
his
years
in
the
service
for
that
(voice
overlap)
just
arguing
that
qualification
for
it,
25-week
qualification.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
our
argument
makes
a
distinction
in
vacations
and
i
think
it
has
an
advantage
to
it
and
that
it
i
think
can
get
the
lower
courts
out
of
the
kind
of
mess
that
they've
been
in,
in
trying
to
work
out
every
detail
of
every
contract.
our
argument
is
this
and
we
think
it's
what
the
act
calls
for
and
what
the
decision
that
this
court
calls
for.
that
where
a
company
makes
a
close
correlation
between
hours
worked
and
vacation
pay,
so
that
for
every
24
hours
work,
you
get
three
hours
towards
a
vacation,
something
like
that.
then
all
the
employees
know
it.
they
know
they're
not
getting
rewarded
for
being
a
continual
employee
but
just
each
hour
they
got
this
little
amount
of
extra
pay.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
and
in
that,
we
say,
it's
compensation.
it's
not
seniority,
it's
compensation
but
when
there's
not
that
kind
of
one-to-one
ration,
when
the
real
question
is
whether
a
man
has
been
a
steady
employee
and
if
he
is,
he
could
then
say
25
weeks
where
the
average
person
probably
put
in
50.
here,
he
gets
same
vacation
with
his
25
weeks,
30
weeks,
35
weeks,
so
forth
and
in
that
situation,
what
you're
really
looking
at
is
seniority
in
the
plan
and
a
man
should
not
lose
his
vacation
because
he's
been
in
military
service
in
that
situation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
there
is
data
in
the
record
on
worksheets
of
particular
employees
junior
to
him,
47
weeks,
the
week
--
the
year
that
he
was
there
beforehand,
i
believe
is
typical.
it
was
stipulated
that
he
would
have
worked
more
than
25
weeks
in
each
of
the
years
that
he
was
in
the
military
service
and
that
people
junior
to
him
had
worked
more
than
25
weeks
in
each
of
those
years
but
there's
sufficient
data
in
the
record
to
show,
it's
also
stipulated
that
he
was
not
a
temporary
or
part-time
employee.
and
there's
sufficient
data
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
was
a
steady
job
and
he
still
works
there.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
know.
it's
not
in
the
record.
i
think
we
can
all
assume
he
received
whatever
it
is
that
the
military
gives
during
that
time.
it's
our
position
that
it
would
be
a
can
of
worms
to
get
into
that
because
you
then
have
to
start
dealing
with
employees
who've
been
in
combat
and
what
do
you
--
how
do
you
count
the
leave
that
a
person
gets
when
he's
in
vietnam
or
something
like
that.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
just
don't
know.
i
assume
he
did
get
some
leave
in
the
military.
we
certainly
don't
argue
that
he
received
no
leave
in
the
military
and
we
don't
ask
that
he
be
paid
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
then
i
understand
the
point
you're
making.
that
is
not
the
government's
theory
for
this
reason
and
in
the
accardi
case.
this
court
pointed
that
in
a
--
in
a
scheme
for
a
severance
pay
that
was
based
on
years
of
service
in
the
year
of
service
and
the
year
of
service
for
so
many
months
of
service
and
the
month
of
service
was
a
month
in
which
so
many
days
of
service
that
it
could
work
out
where
a
person
that
only
had
10
or
12
days
of
service
and
it
would
still
be
counted
as
a
year
of
service.
now,
the
court
rejected
arguments
in
that
case
that
that
was
very
untypical
sort
of
thing
that
a
man
would
be
fired
if
he
was
working
that
little
and
the
court
concentrated
on
the
proposition
that
that
the
scheme
itself
shows
that
that's
not
a
one-to-one
or
not
a
close
ratio
at
all
between
the
amount
of
vacation
and
the
hours
worked.
now,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
and
as
their
worksheets
in
the
appendix
that
will
show
this
would
show
that
the
25
weeks
was
nowhere
near
a
typical
work
year
that
the
47
weeks
or
50
weeks
was
much
closer
to
it
but
we
don't
suggest
that
the
court
should
get
into
that
in
every
case.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
kind
of
case
that
the
total
amount
of
money
that
you're
talking
about
is
usually
small
in
any
individual
case
and
that
the
companies
need
some
fairly
certain
way
of
determining
whether
a
vacation
benefit
is
old
or
not
and
so
do
the
employees
and
it's
better
to
seek
a
solution
that
can
be
easily
applied.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
let
me
put
it
a
different
way.
this
way,
i
understand
it.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
say
that
when
the
man
returns
that
in
that
year,
he
can
count
his
military
service
for
vacation
entitlement,
so
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
even
though
he
got
a
vacation
from
the
army
that
the
military
service
is
a
separate
thing
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to:
number
one,
encourage
people
to
go
into
the
military.
number
two,
to
prevent
people
who
go
into
the
military
from
being
hurt
when
they
come
back
and
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
what
we
--
no,
our
theory
is
that
you
can
ignore
what
happened
in
the
military,
that
the
question
is
when
this
man
came
back
when
you
start
figuring
his
first
vacation
after
he's
back,
you
have
the
right
to
count
his
time
in
the
military
just
as
if
it
had
been
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
a
problem
in
this
that
bothers
me
and
that
is
when
a
man
comes
back
with
only
a
week
or
two
towards
the
end
of
the
year
and
we've
debated
a
bit
about
how
this
should
be
solved.
should
you
do
a
pro
rata
in
that
year
and
then
let
it
be
the
first
full
year.
the
thing
that
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
happen
is
he's
been
in
the
military,
he's
come
back,
he
started
the
year
january
1st
as
everybody
else,
he
shouldn't
have
to
work
through
that
whole
year
and
not
get
a
vacation,
okay.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
fair
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
he
would
get
--
i
prefer
that
speaking
of
the
year
in
which
he
gets
it
because
there's
some
confusion
that
he
would
get
a
vacation
benefit
in
the
year
1968.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
seven
days,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
he
would
get
a
seven-day
vacation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
no,
no.
i'm
only
saying
that
in
the
year
he
comes
back
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
he
came
back
in
1968,
october
7,
1968.
he
came
back
october
7,
1968.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
we'd
only
given
the
same
vacation
that
he
would've
gotten
in
1968
if
he'd
been
working
steady.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
forget
1967.
in
1967
he
got
taken
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
it
was
taken
care
of
when
he
went
in.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
now,
we
have
an
alternative
position
which
is
that
this
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
when,
i
say
we,
what
i
mean
is
i
really
have
to
mean
to
two
things.
one
is
that
the
department
of
justice
represents
the
individual
earl
foster,
out
there
right
now
and
we
argue
the
case
for
him.
when
i
say
we,
we
also
we
also
mean
the
department
of
labor
and
the
justice
department
support
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
this
--
in
this
brief.
i
haven't
gotten
to
talk
much
about
the
cases
but
there
are
two
cases
it
seem
to
me
you
are
in
control
of
this
language
to
the
statute
and
two
cases.
language
to
the
statute
is
that
a
veteran
should
be
restored
in
such
manner
as
to
give
him
such
status
in
his
employment
as
he
would
he
have
enjoyed
if
he
had
continued
in
such
employment
continuously
from
the
time
of
his
entering
the
armed
forces
until
the
time
of
his
restoration
to
such
employment.
that
was
an
act
in
1948
that
really
codifying
this
court's
decision,
perhaps
codifying
and
expanding
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
called
fishgold
but
the
court
has
had
two
cases
on
questions
similar
to
this.
the
big
issue
for
a
while
prior
to
the
accardi
case
among
people
who
dealt
with
this
problem
was
whether
vacation
benefits
severance
pay
pensions
counted
as
questions
of
seniority
and
status
of
whether
they
on
the
other
hand
counted
as
insurance
or
other
benefits
which
would
be
governed
by
the
contract
provisions
for
people
on
leaves
of
absence.
in
accardi,
the
court
for
--
the
court
defined
the
insurance
or
other
benefits
clause
and
it
said
that
that
was
something
in
addition
to
the
seniority
clause
that
it
didn't
keep
severance
pay
from
being
seniority
and
that
it
applied
to
benefits
the
serviceman
might
get
while
he's
in
the
service.
in
other
words,
that
if
an
employee
on
leave
of
absence
could
still
go
to
the
railroad
hospital
or
his
wife
could
still
go
to
the
railroad
hospital,
the
insurance
and
other
benefits
clause
would
assure
that
his
wife
could
still
go
there
even
if
he
was
in
the
service
and
the
court
very
specifically
ruled
on
or
discussed
that
the
insurance
and
other
benefit
clause.
then
prior
to
the
accardi
decision,
in
the
magma
copper
case
that
this
situation,
employees
under
--
who
had
been
denied
both
vacation
pay
and
holiday
pay.
in
the
vacation
pay,
they
were
denied
it
because
--
although
they
had
satisfied
their
work
requirement
of
75%
of
the
available
shifts,
they
were
not
present
at
the
plant
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
because
they
were
in
the
military.
as
to
holiday
pays,
when
they
come
back
from
the
military,
just
think
about
this
when
they'd
come
back
from
the
military,
this
were
then
the
vietnam
war.
they
were
denied
holiday
pay
for
fourth
of
july
and
for
independence
day
though
everyone
else
got
it
because
they
hadn't
satisfied
a
three-month
requirement.
they
had
not
been
on
the
payroll
three
months
when
they
came
back.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
that
and
said
the
company
could
do
that.
it
could
apply
its
contract.
then
the
accardi
case
was
decided
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
the
case
back
again
on
rehearing.
they
reaffirmed
their
prior
decision
with
one
judge
dissenting,
saying,
“we
can't
do
this.
this
is
not
what
other
benefits
means.
this
is
part
of
seniority
see
the
accardi
case.”
the
veterans
petitioned
this
court
and
the
court
granted
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
court
summarily
reversed
the
ninth
circuit
with
an
opinion
that
just
said
reversed,
see
accardi
with
the
citation.
there
was
a
dissent
in
that
case.
justice
stewart
--
justice
douglas
wrote
the
dissent.
justice
stewart
and
justice
harlan
joined
in
the
dissent
and
in
the
dissent,
they
would
have
made
a
distinction
between
the
amount
of
vacation
or
holiday
pay
that
a
person
could
get
and
the
entitlement
to
it
and
would
have
said
that
the
question
of
the
entitlement
to
it
is
not
a
question
of
seniority
and
is
something
that
would
have
to
be
governed
by
the
contract
but
that's
the
position
that
the
court
did
not
take
and
that's
the
subversive
opinion
said
in
an
earlier
case
and
as
a
result
of
that
case
too,
we
think
it's
even
clearer
that
in
this
situation
that
--
that
the
entitlement
should
not
be
governed
by
the
contract
but
should
be
a
question
of
seniority
that
the
serviceman
has
a
right
to.
now,
i
want
to
answer
one
question
raised
by
the
respondents
in
their
brief.
they
say
that
as
a
matter
of
sort
of
legal
principle
that
a
vacation
--
that
vacation
pay
is
a
part
of
wages
paid,
of
salary
and
that
therefore
it
has
to
be
something
other
than
seniority,
that
you
can't
give
a
man
a
salary
for
the
time
that
he
didn't
worked
and
they
cite
a
number
of
cases
and
arbitration
decisions
but
those
cases
make
a
different
point
as
we
read
and
that
is
in
the
1930's,
the
court
sometime
said
that
vacation
is
just
a
gratuity
and
that
the
management
can
do
it
at
once
with
it
and
in
a
number
of
cases,
arbitrators
in
courts
held
that
vacations
are
not
just
questions
of
gratuity
that
there
are
things
bargained
for
and
in
that
sense,
they
say,
that
there
are
function
of
wages
but
there
certainly
was
no
attempt
in
those
cases
to
answer
the
kinds
of
questions
that
are
set
forth
here.
and
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it's
related
to
the
wages,
it's
related
to
his
seniority
in
the
plant.
it
clearly
is
not
just
for
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
it
really
--
the
reason
that
people
have
had
trouble
with
the
vacation
thing
is
analytically,
it's
somewhere
in
between
a
payment
and
a
seniority
right
because
it's
not
just
wages,
it's
not
tied
that
closely
to
it.
it's
for
reasons
other
than
wages
too.
it
keeps
employee
happy
and
able
to
work.
it's
an
in
between
sort
of
thing
and
the
court
has
ruled
on
it
in
the
--
in
magma
copper
to
say
that
it
is
a
function
of
seniority
or
i
take
that
decision
as
ruling
that
way,
that
it's
protected
by
the
act.
there
are
--
i
want
to
give
you
another
citation
which
is
united
states
versus
embassy
restaurant,
359
u.s.
29
which
holds
that
payments
into
a
union
fund
though
analytically
part
of
wages
are
not
considered
part
of
wages
in
bankruptcy
act.
it
simply
illustrates
the
point
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
act
in
particular
context
and
there's
no
flat
rule
one
way
or
the
other,
other
than
what
the
statute
says
in
the
cases
this
court
has
decided
ruling
on.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
--
our
position
is
that
if
it's
clear
in
the
contract
--
one
day
vacation
for
each
month
worked.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
if
it's
tied
close
enough
to
a
precise
amount
of
work
done,
we
then
say
that
it's
a
pure
function
of
wages
and
if
the
contract
is
clear
that
the
returning
veteran
does
not
have
a
right
to
it
and
the
broadest
example
of
that
is
a
pooled
vacation
benefit
where
money
is
actually
set
aside
in
a
pool
for
vacation.
we
don't
claim
with
that
kind
of
program
that
a
person
would
have
this
right.
but
what
we're
talking
about
is
veteran's
legitimate
expectation
when
he
returns
to
work.
i
don't
think
he
would
expect
it
in
that
kind
of
program
but
he
would
here.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
he's
being
made
a
new
man
again,
a
rookie
again.
he's
having
to
go
through
a
year-and-a-half
again
before
he
gets
his
vacation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
and
the
company's
has
written
at
that
way
but
we
don't
think
that
squares
with
seniority
and
status
provisions
of
the
act
and
particularly
with
this
court's
prior
cases
on
it.
this
court,
in
times
perhaps
when
veterans
were
given
a
little
more
deference
than
they
have
been
from
vietnam
war
has
interpreted
this
act,
so
as
to
really
protect
veterans
and
we're
trying
to
support
those
interpretations.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
vacation
was
part
of
his
military
service.
he
may
not
have
wanted
to
be
in
vietnam
or
he
may
not
have
been
able
to
go
anywhere
but
god
knows
where
on
that
vacation.
now,
it
could
have
been
wonderful.
it
might
have
been
two
weeks
in
paris,
you
know,
but
we
just
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
are
a
lot
of
vagaries
in
the
military
about
how
these
things
worked,
we're
trying
to
keep
out
that
you
know
you
can
be
discharged
and
have
to
go
across
the
country
and
think
that's
wonderful
or
you
can
be
discharged
and
be
in
a
terrible
situation.
it
can
be
from
delight
to
horror
and
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
we
want
to
apply
the
principle
at
that
time
in
the
military
counts
as
time
in
the
plant
and
figuring
their
entitlement
to
vacation
when
they
come
back
but
just
when
they
come
back.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
1965
there's
no
problem.
we
have
under
remand
the
argument
of
the
nine
weeks
in
1967.
