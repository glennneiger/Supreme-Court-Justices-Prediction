we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1773,
foster
against
dravo

mr.

chief

e.

a
volunteer,
i
suppose,
is
inducted
in
the
same
sense
that
a
draftee
is
inducted,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
your
argument
--
does
your
argument
one
of
essentially
of
linking
vacation
rights
to
seniority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
his
return.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sachse,
while
you're
pausing
for
a
moment,
let
me
see
perhaps
this
is
oversimplification.
are
you
trying
to
attack
the
82
weeks
of
military
service
on
to
the
bar
--
the
gray
marked
bar
that
preceded
it
or
you
just
kind
of
attack
your
two
gray
marked
bars
together
for
purposes
of
vacation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
he
got
a
vacation
from
the
army?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
if
that's
the
theory
then
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
the
differential
and
pay
too.
that's
your
basic
theory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
going
back
to
my
question,
your
answer
to
my
question
i
should
think
or
simply
would
be,
yes
you
are
trying
to
attack
the
number
of
days
of
military
service
onto
the
number
of
days
of
employment
that
preceded
this
number
of
days.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
form
--
those
holdings
held
that
that's
the
form
of
deferred
compensation,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
it's
related
directly
to
the
wages
he
received
at
the
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
the
length
--
the
length
of
service,
the
length
of
service
plus
the
wages.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
--
isn't
his
legitimate
expectation
that
he
will
not
lose
the
benefit
of
that
period
from
the
time
he
began
to
work
there
until
the
time
he
went
into
the
service?
if
he
gets
his
place
in
line,
as
of
the
date
when
he
left,
why
isn't
he
restored
fully
than
under
both
the
act
and
the
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
no
credit
to
the
employer
for
whatever
number
of
days
vacation
were
given
in
the
military
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
theory
do
you
just
disregard
that
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
it
might
have
been
a
terminal
leave
pay
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
that
the
last
--
and
that's
common
with
military
personnel,
is
it
not,
that
they
are
discharged
as
of
march
30th
that
they
leave
active
duty
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
want
to
treat
them
all
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shoop.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
last
year,
you
mean
precisely
what,
what
period?
you
just
used
the
phrase
last
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
he
returned
or
not
return?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
you
speak
of
the
vacation
bonus,
you
mean
that
the
practice
of
giving
one
day
and
a
half
for
each
day
if
you
take
it
between
january
1st
and
march
1st
or
something.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
your
hypothetical
case,
is
it
your
position
under
that
the
government's
theory
would
require
you
to
take
a
man
who
work
for
30
days
for
dravo
and
then
went
into
the
service
for
four
years
and
then
came
back.
he
might
have
built
up
this
by
attacking
the
military
under
the
30
days
initial
period.
(voice
overlap)
he
might
have
a
month
vacation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
back
up
to
your
statement
about
the
13
weeks
at
the
end
of
1969.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
the
first
week
--
on
the
first
day
of
january,
he
was
then
entitled
to
a
vacation
benefits
deriving
from
the
13
weeks
plus
his
prior
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
when
--
at
what
point
in
1970
would
he
get
the
benefit
of
the
13
weeks
which
he
worked
in
1969?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
total
length
of
his
service
from
his
first
employment
date
down
to
19
--
the
beginning
of
1970
is
used
to
measure
the
amount
of
vacation
but
not
to
give
him
any
dollars
for
the
period
he
was
in
the
military
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes
then,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
--
i
have
three
opinions
to
announce
for
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
73-1773,
foster
against
dravo
corporation.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
marshall
and
filed
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
