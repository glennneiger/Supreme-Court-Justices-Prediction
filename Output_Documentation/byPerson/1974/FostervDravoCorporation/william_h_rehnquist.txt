justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
that's
illustrative
only,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
mr.
sachse
what
the
typical
number
of
weeks
put
in
per
year
was
by
a
worker
would
say
five
years
seniority?
was
it
the
kind
that
he
were
even
expect
to
work
49
or
50
weeks
a
year
was
25
or
30
more
likely?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
suppose
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
interrupt
you
just
a
minute
mr.
sachse.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
assume
that
by
the
government's
own
theory,
it
might
make
a
difference
whether
the
typical
number
of
weeks
worked
was
say
30
and/or
50
that
if
the
most
a
man
could
expect
to
work
during
the
year
were
30-32
weeks
and
the
company
required
25,
then
it
might
be
more
analogous
to
a
kind
of
an
earned
credit
type
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
got
plenty
time
to
leave.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it's
drawn
by
congress,
aren't
you
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
the
government's
position,
mr.
sachse,
in
the
case
of
the
contract
that
calls
for
a
one
day
vacation
for
each
month
worked
the
preceding
year?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
each
month,
each
two
weeks,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
not
still
seeking
that
much,
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
one
thing
the
government
contends
as
i
understand
it
is
that
this
is
less
like
an
earned
vacation
than
it
might
be
since
the
man
who
works
25
weeks
and
the
man
who
works
50
weeks
gets
exactly
the
same
amount
of
vacation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
how
about
two
guys
of
each
work
for
dravo
five
years.
one
who
works
25
weeks
and
one
who
works
50
weeks,
the
preceding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
he
gets
not
vacation
from
anyone
in
19
--
between
19
--
in
the
year
1969.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
like
saying,
he
earned
a
vacation
sometime
in
1970
but
he
didn't
get
anything
since
1969?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
sure.
you
always
figure
you're
going
to
put
in
some
rookie
time
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
before
you
qualify
but
the
government's
argument
is
i'm
sure
is
that
he
shouldn't
have
to
put
it
in
when
he
comes
to
work
and
then
when
he
first
comes
back
from
the
service
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
put
in
a
year
--
from
january
1,
1968
to
january
1,
1969,
he
put
in
presumably
39
weeks
with
the
military
and
13
weeks
with
dravo
but
he
got
no
vacation
the
following
year.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
third
circuit
say
that
that
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
particular
issue
that
the
chief
justice
inquired
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit,
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
employee
would
have
a
right
to
litigate
at
least
as
matter
of
contract
law,
whether
he's
entitled
of
pro
rata
vacation.
