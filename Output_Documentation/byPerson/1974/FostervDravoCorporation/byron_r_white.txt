you
mean,
anybody
can
say
to
his
work
time
he's
been
a
volunteer
for
the
army
it
would
be
years
but
they
never
are
coming
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
now,
right
now
if
you
volunteer
for
a
full
hitch
in
the
army,
it
--
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
you
involved
here,
this
act
upon
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
say,
that
although
the
act
doesn't
require
you
to
recognize
that
he's
entitled
to
a
vacation,
you
say
that
he
works
all
of
1969,
then
in
1970,
he's
entitled
to
a
vacation
and
you
say
you
will
--
the
length
of
the
vacation
pay
that
he's
entitled
to,
you
say,
will
include
the
time
he
was
in
the
military.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
--
now,
do
you
say
the
act
requires
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
must
treat
him
as
having
been
on
the
payroll.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
only
--
that's
only
if
you
work
those
--
that's
only
if
you've
been
entitled
to
vacation
during
those
periods.
