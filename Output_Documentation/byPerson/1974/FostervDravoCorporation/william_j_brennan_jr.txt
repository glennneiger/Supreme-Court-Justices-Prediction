justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
believe
did
petitioner
receive
while
he
was
in
the
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
he
get
vacation
for
both
1967
and
1968?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
of
how
much
--
what
--
if
he
had
been
in
continuous
employment,
he
would
have
had
in
1967
a
vacation
of
how
long,
a
week,
two
weeks?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
seven
days?
and
in
1968,
he
would
have
get
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
so,
are
you
suggesting
that
he
gets
14
days
vacation
in
the
remaining
13
weeks
of
1968?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
not
the
year
he
came
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
now,
what
--
how
much
vacation
does
he
get?
the
vacation
he
didn't
have
in
1967
as
well
as
the
vacation
he
didn't
have
in
1968?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
forget
1967.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what's
the
enlistment
hitch
now
under
the
volunteer
argument,
three
years
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
or
not
he
earned
any
vacation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
or
not
he
earned
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
mr.
shoop,
you
said
this
was
within
the
statute,
this
is
related
to
seniority
yet
section
2
says
should
be
so
restored
in
such
manner
as
to
give
him
such
status
in
his
employment
as
he
would
have
enjoyed
if
it
continued
in
such
employment
continuously
from
the
time
he
was
entering
the
armed
forces
to
a
time
his
restoration
of
such
employment.
now,
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
before
of
the
chap
who
had
not
gone
into
service
going
to
be
20
weeks
or
15
weeks.
i
gather
you're
giving
him
the
same
status
in
his
employment
as
that
probable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
at
least
for
purposes
of
a
length
of
vacation
he
gets
in
1970
that
he
earns
in
1969,
he's
given
credit
for
his
time
in
service.
