mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
let
me
set
forth
to
the
court
the
position
of
the
government
at
least
when
they
tried
the
case
in
the
district
court
where
i
was
there.
the
government
is
seeking
vacation
for
the
year
1967
and
1968
under
this
chart
that
they
have
set
forth.
they
are
seeking
64
hours
of
vacation
in
1967
and
72
hours
of
vacation
in
1968
for
mr.
foster
and
as
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief,
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
the
complaint
in
the
initial
case
sought
that
much.
i
think
they
misunderstand
vacation
benefits
as
i
pointed
out
on
page
4
of
my
brief,
mr.
justice.
a
person
earns
their
vacation
in
one
year
and
they
take
it
in
their
next
year.
mr.
foster
earned
his
vacation
in
1966.
he
received
it
in
march
of
1967
when
he
went
into
the
military
service.
he
earns
his
vacation
in
1969
and
on
january
1st
of
1970,
he's
entitled
to
every
cent
of
vacation
that
he
would
have
earned
in
that
last
year.
that
is
69
(voice
overlap)
vacation.
you
take
in
60.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
okay,
between
the
year
of
1966,
between
january
1st
of
1966
and
december
31st
of
1966,
mr.
foster
earned
one
weeks
vacation,
56
hours.
on
january
1st
of
1968,
he
was
entitled
to
leave
the
employer
dravo
and
do
whatever
was
necessary
and
he
would
have
gotten
that
vacation.
he
could
have
gone
on
vacation
that
week
as
a
lot
of
people
do
in
the
first
of
week
of
january
or
he
could've
waited
later
on
in
the
year.
now,
in
the
year
of
1969,
when
he
returned
form
the
military
service,
he
works
that
year
and
he
earns
his
vacation
which
he
is
entitled
to
in
full
on
january
1,1970.
he
again
can
take
the
pay
and
leave
the
employment
of
dravo
or
he
can
take
his
vacation
or
he
can
take
it
some
time
later
on.
the
--
and
provided
during
that
year
of
1969
and
provided
during
that
year
of
1966,
he
works
26
work
weeks,
i
mean
25
work
weeks,
excuse
me.
he
has
to
earn,
have
an
earnings
in
those
years
before
he
can
get
the
vacation
the
next
year.
you
earn
it
in
1967,
take
it
in
1968,
earn
it
in
'199
and
take
it
in
1970.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
no.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
that
is
not
correct.
the
man
who
works
25
weeks
and
the
man
who
work
50
weeks
are
both
entitled
to
a
vacation.
that's
the
difference.
the
man
who
works
--
has
worked
for
dravo
for
20
years
is
entitled
to
five
weeks
vacation
under
this
contract
in
issue.
the
man
who
has
worked
for
dravo
for
five
years
is
entitled
to
a
different
length
of
vacation.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
they
both
would
get
the
same
vacation
the
next
year.
now,
dravo
however
expects
every
employee
to
week
regularly
during
the
course
of
the
year.
we
expect
everybody
to
normally
attend
work
whose
on
the
payroll
50,
49
weeks.
this
provision
is
negotiated
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
a
union
to
protect
people
who
for
some
reason
may
be
ill
during
the
course
of
the
year.
they
say,
“gee!
look,
here's
a
guy
who's
been
ill
for
a
month,
why
shouldn't
he
get
a
vacation?
here's
a
man
who
may
have
left
for
a
couple
of
months
for
a
leave
of
absence
because
his
wife
is
ill,
why
shouldn't
he
get
a
vacation
in
the
next
year?”
so
therefore,
the
union
comes
to
the
company
and
says,
“let's
make
a
man
earn
his
vacation
if
he
works
25
weeks.”
the
company
expects
anybody
who
is
regularly
on
the
payroll
except
for
leaves
of
absence,
except
for
illness
to
work
50
weeks,
49
weeks,
what
we
all
work
during
the
course
of
the
year
and
not
examples
like
they
try
and
bring
out
in
these
cases
if
the
man
could
only
work
25
hours
or
something
like
that.
he'd
be
fired.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
dravo
is
a
shipbuilding
corporation
in
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania
and
business
is
pretty
good,
right.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
now,
to
answer
some
other
questions
that
were
raised
in
part
of
my
argument,
the
question
here
is
more
than
the
$377.92
involved
which
are
the
vacation
entitlements
in
1967
and
the
vacation
entitlements
in
1968
which
by
the
way
your
honors,
in
1967,
he
became
entitled
to
another
days
vacation.
he
would
--
his
vacation
entitlement
in
1967
is
64
hours.
his
vacation
entitlement
in
1968
is
72
hours.
we
recognized
that
when
he
got
his
vacation
in
1970
and
we
gave
him
credit
for
his
military
service
as
far
as
the
length
of
his
vacation
goes.
that
is
not
at
issue
here
and
we
did
recognize
that.
we're
talking
about
the
entitlement
to
a
vacation.
now,
let
me
point
out
the
economic
significance
of
finding
the
benefit
as
the
government
would
argue
here.
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute
that
has
no
statute
limitation.
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
is
only
detriment
to
filing
suit
is
the
doctrine
of
laches.
at
least
in
pennsylvania
and
as
recognized
by
the
third
circuit,
laches
doesn't
come
into
effect
into
a
man
who
has
unknown
right.
this
statute
has
not
been
significantly
amended
since
its
enactment
in
1940.
so
theoretically,
you'll
find
for
the
government
every
employee
at
dravo
who
has
been
in
the
military
service
can
file
a
suit
to
recover
back
vacation
pay.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
well,
if
he
returned.
right.
he
would
have
to
return.
moreover,
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
90
days,
he
has
to
return
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
--
within
90
days
after
his
discharge
from
the
selective
service
to
be
entitled
to
any
reemployment
benefit.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
yes,
let
me
point
that
out.
that
was
my
next
question
and
the
act
does
because
a
public
policy
to
encourage
enlistments
in
the
military
service
also
protect
people
who
are
enlisted,
therefore,
your
question
as
to
whether
this
is
moot,
although
i
would
contend
it
isn't
anyway
of
the
laches
argument.
if
people
who
do
enlist
are
protected,
they
are
protected,
mr.
justice
stewart
for
a
period
of
four
years.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
if
they
enlist
in
the
military
service,
they
can
stay
in
the
military
service
for
four
years.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
a
fifth
year,
if
they
are
requested
by
the
government
to
stay
an
extra
year
and
this
came
up
during
the
cuban
missile
crisis
is
when
they
asked
some
people
to
stay
in
the
service
and
they
amended
that
statute
of
that
time
to
increase
up
to
five
years
upon
request
of
the
service.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
under
the
government's
theory
what
can
happen.
an
employee
from
dravo
can
enlist
in
the
military
service
on
january
1st
of
1975.
he
can
continue
in
the
military
service.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
i
think
it's
still
three
years.
it
was
the
last
time
i
heard
but
he
can
continue
in
the
military
service
until
december,
in
the
middle
of
december
of
1979.
he
can
then,
in
90
days,
sometime
in
march
of
1975,
come
back
to
work
for
dravo.
according
to
the
government,
we
could
owe
him
anywhere
between
eight
and
20
weeks
vacation
pay,
the
day
he
came
back
to
work
for
us
because
he
has
met
the
requirements
of
the
re-employment
statute.
i
submit,
your
honors,
the
next
day,
he
could
quit
and
go
to
work
for
somebody
else
and
there's
nothing
we
could
do
about
it.
moreover,
you
take
their
argument
one
other
point,
the
lower
courts
accepting
the
decision
like
this
could
say
hospitalization
benefits,
life
insurance,
how
about
vacation
bonuses.
many
companies
pay
a
bonus
for
a
vacation
and
taken
at
various
times
of
the
year.
is
he
entitled
to
this?
according
to
the
government's
theory,
i
think
you
can
go
as
far
as
holding
that
it
would
include
wages
that
for
some
reason
maybe
argued
to
appear
a
prerequisite
of
seniority.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
my
familiarity
is
we
give
him
$30.00.
many
companies
give
$50.00
to
take
a
vacation
between
january
15th
and
march
1st.
$40.00
to
take
a
vacation
in
the
next
two
months
and
nothing
to
take
it
during
the
summer
and
then
going
back
up
in
the
fall.
steel
and
aluminum
all
have
these
type
of
bonus
arrangements.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
if
the
position
he'd
held
in
the
30
days
was
other
than
temporary
and
it's
no
holding
that
he
was
a
--
that
a
probationary
employee
as
other
than
temporary
that
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
allen
versus
weirton
steel,
i
believe
in
quite
a
number
of
years
ago.
so,
probationary
employee
and
other
than
temporary
are
not
synonymous.
however,
if
he
was
a
summer
employee
who
came
to
work
for
dravo
for
the
summer
and
wasn't
going
to
come
back
in
the
fall,
he
entered
the
military.
he
would
be
what
is
known
as
a
temporary
employee
under
the
term
for
the
act.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
he
certainly
wouldn't
under
any
of
the
plants
that
i
am
familiar
with
but
a
logical
extension
of
the
government's
argue
--
argument
in
this
case
would
appear
to
me
to
hold
that
that's
a
possibility.
you
know,
there's
no
earned,
you
know.
my
understanding
of
vacation
benefits
and
my
understanding
of
all
these
other
benefits
are
they
are
earned
benefits.
they
are
benefits
that
you
earn
by
working
for
dravo.
i
think
this
court
has
aptly
pointed
out
that
the
vacation
benefits
between
the
time
he
left
dravo
and
between
the
time
he
came
back
were
paid
for
by
the
government.
at
this
time,
remark
of
counsel
significantly
higher,
higher
rate
of
two-and-a-half
days
per
every
months
of
service,
he
gets
30
days
vacation
the
year,
he
only
gets
eight,
seven
at
dravo.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
in
the
year
1969,
he
got
no
vacation
time
off
but
he
earned
vacation
that
was
taken
effective
january
1st
of
1970,
or
could've
been
taken
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
he
did
not
get
any
time
off
or
he
did
not
get
any
pay
but
he
earned
a
vacation
that
he
takes
in
1970
and
i
think
you
will
find
that
that's
the
way
vacations
are.
you
work
for
a
period
of
time
and
then
you
get
a
vacation.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
no
sir,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
you
have
to
put
in
time
every
year
to
get
a
vacation.
on
a
year
sir,
you
could
take
a
year
off
and
you
wouldn't
--
you
would
get
vacation.
that
isn't
true.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
that's
right.
also
i
stated
before,
this
act
was
enacted
in
1940
and
except
to
codify
what
was
the
escalator
principle
in
fishgold
versus
sullivan
drydock,
the
act
has
not
significantly
been
amended.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
no,
sir.
to
qualify
for
a
vacation
in
any
one
year,
a
regular
employee
must
perform
work
for
dravo
corporation
a
period
of
25
weeks.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
he
would
never
get
the
benefit
of
working
those
13
weeks
except
for
the
fact
that
in
length
of
vacation,
it
will
be
recognized
that
the
entire
year
of
1968
would
be
--
i
believe
those
13
weeks
were
worked
in
1968,
your
honor.
that's
between
1968
and
1969.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
the
government
has
at
this
time
in
their
brief
that
wasn't
reached
an
argument
made
an
argument
for
a
pro
rata
benefits.
they
say,
“well,
at
least,
he's
entitled
the
13
25ths
of
a
vacation.
that
issue
was
never
raised
at
the
trial
level.
as
i
submit
in
my
brief.
if
your
honor
would
look
on
page
24
of
my
brief
in
the
appendix
on
page
10,
what
happened
was
the
judge
at
the
trial
level,
tried
to
effect
the
settlement
between
dravo
and
the
government
and
he
suggested
this
as
being
an
issue
maybe
we
could
pro
rate
the
vacation
for
1968.
i
specifically
stated
to
him
on
the
record
at
that
time
that
that
was
not
the
issue
before
this
court
and
he
recognized
it.
that
was
not
the
issue
before
the
district
court
at
that
time,
and
the
judge
said,
“yes,
i
recognize
it”
but
being
a
non-jury
trial
he
was
trying
to
settle
it
may
have
said
a
number
of
things
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
he's
one
of
us
who
believe,
we
are
going
to
be
here
or
i
was
going
to
be
here
today
when
we
tried
this
case.
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
the
issue
before
the
district
court
would
be
one,
was
the
matter
raised
and
litigated
there?
and
two,
what
is
the
outcome,
or
what
decision
would
this
court
make
based
on
the
law
in
the
contract
in
issue?
if
you
affirm
the
third
--
that's
exactly
what
the
third
circuit
did,
they
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
because
no.
because
you
treat
him
as
seniority.
he
is
in
his
relationship
to
other
employees
has
five-year
seniority.
you
look
at
your
contract
and
you
find
that
people
with
five-year
seniority
are
entitled
to
“x”
number
of
weeks
vacation.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
not
necessarily.
i
would
--
that
issue
wasn't
raised
and
i
wholeheartedly
agree
with
the
company's
actions
in
this
case
of
giving
the
man
his
benefit
in
the
military
service
towards
the
length
of
his
vacation.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
okay.
he
would
receive
no
vacation
benefits
for
the
year
1967,
that
which
he
worked
less
than
25
work
week.
he
would
receive
no
vacation
benefits
for
the
year
1968,
that
which
he
worked
less
than
25
work
weeks.
he
would
receive
vacation
benefits
in
1969
when
he
worked
more
than
25
work
weeks
which
would
be
taken
in
1970
and
the
length
of
his
vacation
i
think
is
the
question
you're
getting
to
would
be
treated
just
as
if
he
had
been
an
employee
and
on
the
role
of
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
whether
or
not
he
took
it
in
the
previous
years,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
whether
or
not
he
earned
it,
right
i
think
in
those
cases
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
that's
pure
seniority.
the
length
of
the
vacation
is
pure
seniority.
the
entitlement
to
a
vacation
of
any
given
year
is
earned.
you
earn
your
vacation
this
year
to
take
it
next
year.
let
me
just
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
because
1965,
see
that's
where
they
missed
the
--
the
government
isn't
getting
the
--
he
got
his
1965
vacation
in
1966.
see,
he
worked
22
weeks
in
1965
and
he
received
20
hours
vacation
in
1966.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
the
rookies
--
and
this
is
--
this
is
something
that's
negotiated
in
a
contract
to
protect
an
employee
who
is
coming
on
the
payroll
new.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
and
he
is
entitled
to
some
benefits
at
that
period
of
time
as
a
new
employee
but
he's
only
entitled
to
one
day.
in
this
period
of
time,
mr.
foster
in
this
case
is
entitled
to
over
two
weeks
vacation
when
he
returns
that's
why
you
wouldn't
return
as
a
rookie,
you'd
want
to
return
as
a
--
as
a
veteran,
so
you
can
get
that
length
of
vacation
better
than
you
had
before.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
no
sir,
you
earn
your
vacation
each
and
every
year.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
as
that
probably
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
yes
sir,
right.
the
length
of
vacation,
no
problem.
we're
giving
him
all
the
credit
and
to
point
out
further
that
a
vacation
is
an
earned
benefit
under
the
dravo
contract,
i
would
point
out
that
in
article
iv,
section
3
as
cited
at
my
brief,
a
person
at
dravo
who
works
considerably
more
overtime
as
to
say
regularly
six
days
a
week
receives
more
vacation
than
the
person
who
doesn't
work
those
hours.
so,
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
amount
of
time
worked
and
the
amount
of
vacation
you
get
and
that
you
get
more
vacation
if
you
worked
longer
hours
and
more
overtime.
the
two
cases
that
were
cited
by
the
government
and
relied
on,
i
think,
ought
to
be
examined
in
some
detail
and
the
first
was
accardi.
what
happened
in
the
accardi
decision
was
the
pennsylvania
railroad
attempted
to
abolish
the
position
of
firemen
on
new
diesel
tugs
back
in
1959.
a
strike
ensued,
the
firemen
went
on
strike.
the
intra-strike
was
finally
settled
in
1960
with
an
agreement
that
the
position
of
firemen
was
abolished.
however,
they
would
remain
on
the
payroll,
those
firemen
who
had
20
years
or
more
seniority
and
they
remained
on
the
work
force.
the
other
part
of
the
agreement
paid
severance
pay
to
those
employees
who
had
less
than
20
years
seniority.
the
severance
pay
was
paid
on
a
theory
of
the
number
of
years
of
compensated
service
you
had
with
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
the
pennsylvania
railroad
being
wrong
again
argued
that
this
was
an
earned
benefit.
this
court
correctly
saw
it
wasn't.
it
couldn't
be
an
earned
benefit
because
the
people
who
works
severed
would
never
ever
get
the
benefit
and
everybody
who
was
discharged
got
some
benefit.
the
only
thing
they
were
arguing
about
was
the
amount
of
the
benefit
and
that's
exactly
like
our
vacation
policy.
the
amount
is
not
in
question.
it
is
a
prerequisite
of
seniority
and
the
entire
agreement
was
the
severance
pay.
there
was
no
full
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
reviewed
the
entire
contract
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
vacations
at
dravo
are
an
earned
benefit.
eagar
versus
magma
copper
has
also
been
referred
to.
it
was
a
pre
curiam
decision.
there
was
a
dissent
in
that
case
written
by
justice
douglas
on
behalf
of
you,
justice
stewart
and
the
late
justice
harlan.
in
that
case
though,
eagar
had
worked
the
amount
of
time
that
was
necessary
to
receive
the
benefit.
he
had
worked
75%
of
the
hours
in
the
week
before
he
entered
the
military
service
and
the
year
before
he
entered
the
military
service.
the
only
thing
was
he
wasn't
on
the
payroll
at
the
end
of
his
first
anniversary
year
and
wasn't
on
the
payroll
on
december
31st
of
the
vacation
of
earning
year.
that's
the
only
difference.
he
earned
his,
here,
it
has
not
been
earned.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
but
he
met
--
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
--
all
the
earnings
requirements
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
you
take
my
position
that
vacations
are
an
earned
benefit
that
they
are
a
payment
or
earnings
deferred
to
compensation
for
working
at
the
company.
eagar
is
entitled
to
it
and
anybody
else
that
dravo
is
entitled
to
it
provided
they
have
earned
their
vacation.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
no
but
i
got
this
similar
agreement.
in
my
case,
you
have
to
work
25
work
weeks,
in
his,
you
have
to
work
75%
percent
of
the
work
week.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
i
would
say,
my
position
on
those
if
we
have
those
in
these
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
those
are
seniority
provisions.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
shoop,
jr.
yes,
sir.
my
law
school
professor,
however,
told
me
that
a
dissent
of
three
justices
in
the
supreme
court
is
better
than
nothing
at
all
and
so
therefore,
i
would
ask
for
your
consideration
to
--
[laughter
attempt]
of
your
dissent
in
that
opinion
which
goes
further
by
the
way
than
i
intend
to
ask
this
court
--
than
i
have
asked
this
court
to
go
today.
as
i
stated
before,
dravo
expects
every
employer,
every
employee
to
perform
a
work
of
50
weeks.
the
judges
and
justices
who
in
their
judicial
opinions
have
thoroughly
considered
the
issue
of
vacation
entitlement
have
all
determined
that
vacation
entitlement
does
not
automatically
accrue
as
a
result
of
seniority
but
are
earned
benefits
as
found
by
this
court,
as
far
back
as
1948,
judge
learned
hand
in
dwyer
v.
crosby
cited
in
my
brief
held
this.
judge
hufstedler
in
austin
versus
sears
and
roebuck
in
1974
held
this.
judge
hill
in
kasmeier
in
the
tenth
circuit
held
this.
judge
adams
in
the
third
circuit
held
this.
judge
batten
dissenting
in
locaynia
in
the
ninth
circuit
held
this.
these
gentlemen
had
all
reviewed
thoroughly
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
issue.
the
facts
of
both
accardi
and
eagar
and
found
as
well
as
justice
douglas,
justice
stewart
and
justice
harlan
that
vacation
benefits
are
an
earned
benefit
that
you
must
meet
that
earnings
requirement,
in
this
case
of
25
weeks
to
be
entitled
in
that
year
or
the
next
year
to
a
vacation.
thank
you.
