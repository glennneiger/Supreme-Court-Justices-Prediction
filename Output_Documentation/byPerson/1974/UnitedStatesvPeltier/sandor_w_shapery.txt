mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
main
question
that
we're
confronted
with
here
is
whether
or
not
almeida-sanchez
should
be
applied
retroactively
or
prospectively.
however,
before
we
should
even
approach
that
question,
we
must
realize
that
the
issue
of
retroactive--
retroactivity
only
applies
to
a
new
constitutional
rule.
the
dissenting
opinion
in
milton
versus
wainwright,
i
believe
the
government
will
clearly
agree,
it
sets
out
the
test
for
determining
whether
or
not
a
new
constitutional
rule
is
even
stated
by
a
decision
of
this
court
and,
that
is,
whether
it
overrules
clear
past
precedent
or
disrupts
a
practice
long-accepted
and
widely
relied
upon.
the
third--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
don't
feel
that
any
statutes
of
the
united
states
are
greater
than
the
constitution.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i--
could
you
possibly
rephrase
the
question?
i--
maybe
it's
my
misunderstanding,
but
i
feel
that
the
statute--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
read
literally,
the
statute
would
purportedly
authorize
the
search.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
had
even
been
presented
in
this
court.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
think,
to
determine
the
retroactivity
issue
in
that
context,
we
should
look
at
the
statute
itself,
and
whether
or
not
the
reliance
on
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
even
reasonable
and
i
feel
that
looking
at
this
statute,
1357
section
a
(1)
and
a
(2).
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
don't
think
it
was.
i
don't
think
the
section
a
(3)
being
read
devoid
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
reasonable
in
light
of
the
fact
that
sections
a
(1)
and
a
(2)
have
recognized
fourth
amendment
requirements
of
constitutionality.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
no,
i
am
suggesting
that
the
attorneys
that
wrote
the
statute
for
the
government
were
perfectly
aware
of
the
problem
and,
where
aware
of
it,
they
were
treading
on,
so
to
speak,
thin
ice
in
regard
to
this
but
saw
this
was
a
viable
alternative
and
that
they
may
step
forward
and
take
their
chances
until
the
question
is
presented
to
this
court.
it
was
submitted
that
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
overruled
past
precedent.
however,
the
test
is
clear
past
precedent.
we
do
not
feel
that
one
case
prior
to
almeida-sanchez
allowing
a
roving
patrol
to
stop
and
search
a
car
without
probable
cause
or
even
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
criminal
activity
was
at
foot
establishes
clear
past
precedent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
has
held,
with
the
exception
of
united
states
versus
almeida-sanchez,
that
all
other
cases
that
ever
addressed
themselves
to
that
issue
required
either
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
had
contraband
or
illegal
aliens,
or
that
there
was
a
reasonable
certainty
existed
that
contraband
was
aboard
the
vehicle
at
the
time
it
entered
the
united
states,
or
a
reasonable
certainty
that
the
vehicle
contained
aliens
or
goods
which
had
been
smuggled
into
the
united
states.
this
is
the
ninth
circuit's
own
recognition
of
their
prior
case
law.
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
have
uniformly
required
reasonable
or
founded
suspicion
to
stop
a
search
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez.
it
would
appear,
therefore,
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
only
court
and
that
united
states
versus
almeida-sanchez
and
united
states
versus
miranda
are
the
only
cases
which
held
that
the
border
patrol
can
make
a
roving
stop
and
search
of
a
vehicle
without
probable
cause
or
founded
suspicion
or
even
any
recognition
of
fourth
amendment
rights
under
the
constitution.
on
this
basis,
i
feel
that
it
can
be
hardly
argued
that
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
overruled
clear
past
precedent.
the
second
test
is
did
this
court's
decision
overrule
a
practice
long-accepted
and
widely
relied
upon?
as
i
have
pointed
out,
i
feel
that
the
reliance
must
be
reasonable.
i
do
not
think
that
the--
that
illegal
governmental
activity
should
be
allowed
to
establish
constitutional
precedent
no
matter
how
long
it
has
been
relied
upon,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
government
is
asking
to
occur
in
this
situation.
the
government
is
relied
on
section
1357
(a)
3
on
its
literal
interpretation
which
is
completely
devoid
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
it
is
unreasonable,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
prior
decisions
of
circuit
courts
have
held
that
the
same
statute
of
a
prior
code
section,
1357
(a)
1,
applied
the
fourth
amendment
reasonable
suspicion
standard
to
interrogate
an
alien,
and
that
was
in
the
case
of
au
yi
lau
versus
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
likewise,
section
1357
(a)
2
applied
the
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
to
arrest
an
alien,
and
yam
sang
kwai,
another
circuit
court
decision.
on
that
basis,
i
feel
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
hold
that
the
first
two
sections
of
the
act
require
recognition
of
the
fourth
amendment
where
the
third
section
of
the
act
can
be
read
completely
devoid
of
the
constitutional
requirement.
likewise,
i
feel
that
the
governmental
reliance
on
the
statute
was
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
history
of
the
immigration
laws
which
have
been
set
out
in
the
brignoni-ponce
brief
of
the
petitioner.
all
prior
statutes
recognize
fourth
amendment
requirements
even
in
this
area.
furthermore,
the
small
number
of
cases
which
have
even
addressed
themselves
to
the
roving
search
show
that
there
was
very
little
reliance
upon
this
practice.
therefore,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
overruled
the
practice
which
was
long-accepted
and
widely
relied
upon
as
one
of
the
requirements
to
determine
whether
a
new
constitutional
rule
has
been
established.
on
that
basis,
it
is
submitted
that
almeida-sanchez
did
not
establish
a
new
constitutional
rule,
but
merely
reaffirmed
the
long
line
of
decisions
which
have
followed
carroll
v.
united
states.
to
hold
that
almeida-sanchez
establishes
a
new
exclusionary
rule
based
solely
on
governmental
reliance
would
be
to
hold
that
the
government
can
establish
constitutional
precedent
by
its
illegal
unilateral
activity.
the
third
test
is
set
out
in
chevron
oil
versus
huson.
well,
it's
whether
or
not
almeida-sanchez
decided
an
issue
of
first
impression
whose
resolution
was
not
clearly
foreshadowed.
the
chevron
oil
case
held
that
respondent
can
only
rely
on
the
law
as
it
then
was.
so,
he
must
look
at
the
laws
that
then
was.
the
fifth
circuit
had
determined
that
a
roving
check
always
required
at
least
reasonable
or
founded
suspicion
and
recognize
application
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit
and
tenth
circuit,
since
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
have
stated
that
a
roving
check
always
require
probable
cause,
they'd
find
this--
they'd
achieve
this
conclusion
by
determining
that
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
did
not
state
a
new
rule,
but
merely
reaffirmed
carroll
versus
the
united
states
and,
on
that
basis,
that
has
always
been
the
rule.
based
on
the
chevron
oil
case
which
held
that
respondent
can
only
rely
on
the
law
as
it
then
was,
it
is
submitted
that
paltier
can
only
rely
on
the
law
as
it
then
was,
and
it
has
been
determined
that
the
law
as
it
then
was
required
probable
cause
to
stop
and
search
a
vehicle
by
a
roving
border
patrol.
even
applying
the
straight
reasonableness
test
as
set
out
in
the
dissent
in
almeida-sanchez,
peltier,
unlike
almeida-sanchez,
lacked
reasonableness.
by
comparison,
the
highway
where
almeida-sanchez
was
apprehended
came
directly
from
the
border.
in
peltier,
the
highway
upon
which
he
was
apprehended
began
in
downtown
san
diego
and
is
one
of
the
main--
three
major
roads
leading
out
of
southern
california.
in
almeida-sanchez,
there
is
no
checkpoint.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
it
was
parallel
to
the
border,
but
i
believe
it
terminated
in
calexico
or
mexicali
which
is
the
twin
border
town.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
it
was
further
stated
in
almeida-sanchez
that
this
highway
is
often
used
bec--
by
smugglers
of
contraband
and
illegal
aliens
because
it
did
not
have
a
checkpoint.
on
the
contrary,
there
is
a
fixed
checkpoint.
there
was
a
fixed
checkpoint
on
highway
395,
right--
near
the
point
where
peltier
was
stopped.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
no,
this
is
the
temecula
checkpoint.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
it's
approximately
the
same
location
from
the
border
but
another
major
highway.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
yes,
it
is.
that's
correct.
almeida-sanchez
was
purportedly
stopped
20
miles
from
the
border,
where
paltier
was
stopped
70
miles
from
the
border,
separated
by
the
second
largest
city
in
the
state
of
california.
in
almeida-sanchez--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
san
diego.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
right.
highway
395,
upon
which
mr.
paltier
was
stopped,
begins
in
downtown
san
diego
and
all
of
the
residents
of
san
diego
wishing
to
go
to
northern
inland
california
or
even
to
the
midwest
would
be
going
on
highway
395
as
the
most
direct
route.
so,
there
would
be
millions
of
people
who
had
never
even
been
to
the
mexican
border
travelling
on
this
highway
in
the
same
direction
that
mr.
peltier
was
and
at
the
same
time
point.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
mr.
peltier
is
a
united
states
citizen
and
he,
as
far
as
i
know,
had
never
even
been
to
mexico.
i
don't
even
know
whether
he
speaks
any
spanish.
i
don't
think
he
does,
but
i
know
that
he
does
not
speak
with
an
accent
and,
upon
communicating
with
him,
the
border
patrol
officers
could
easily
recognize
that
he
was
not
a
mexican
citizen
or
even
of
mexican
descent
as
they
had
stated
when
they
pulled
him
over.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
that
is
true,
but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
any
person,
any
citizen
in
this--
in
san
diego
might
not
be
having
aliens
behind
the
backseat.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
none
whatsoever
and,
in
fact,
that
is
another
distinguishing
factor
between
almeida-sanchez
and
peltier.
it
is
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
almeida-sanchez
was
a
resident
of
mexico
and
had
stated
that
he
was
coming
from
mexico.
mr.
peltier
was
questioned
before
the
search
as
to
his
citizenship
and
as
to
where
he
was
coming
from
and
into
his
destination.
at
which
point,
he
stated
he
was
coming
from
san
diego
and
he
was
going
to
las
vegas,
never
even
having
mentioned
the
mexican
border
or
having
been
there.
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
applying
the
reasonableness
test
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
is
set
out
in
the
dissent
in
almeida-sanchez,
taking
all
of
the
factors
in
almeida-sanchez--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
the
principal
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
unlawful
governmental
conduct
and,
at
the
same
time,
insulate
the
court
system
and
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
system
in
determining
its
decisions.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
that,
in
as
much
as--
i
believe
the
conduct
in
this
situation
was
one
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
had
always
required--
all
the
statutes
have
required
probable
cause.
we
have
to
look
to
the
reasonableness
and
i
think
that
to
hold
that
the
exclusionary
rule
only
totally
across
the
border
will
prevent
future
conduct
would
be
to
give
the
government
and
overzealous
law
enforcement
officers
a
free
ride
to
conduct
illegal
activities
until
such
time
as
this
court
decides
the
issue.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
feel
that
congress
has
always
recognized
the
fourth
amendment,
in
that
in
passing
this
legislation
they
did
not
intend
to
completely
abrogate
the
fourth
amendment
in
this
particular
statute,
as
is
shown
in
section
a
(1)
and
a
(2).
there
has
always
been
recognition
for
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
feel
that
it
is
the
unilateral
activity
of
the
border
patrol
which
has
overstepped
the
bounds,
not
congress.
and,
on
that
basis,
it
is
their
unilateral
illegal
activity
which
has
abrogated
the
use
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
no,
i'm
not.
i--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
think
there's
a
distinction
that
it's
been--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
believe
it
refers
to
a
search
at
the
border
of
functional
equivalent.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
that
is
correct,
but
i
meant--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i'm
suggesting
that
the
statute
requires
recognition
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
feel
that
the
probable
cause
issue
at
the
border
is
not
brought
up
in
as
much
as
the
government
has
a
need
to
prepa--
protect
the
integrity
of
the
entire
country.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
that
is
correct.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
believe
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1946
and
then
amended
in
1952.
the
reasonable
distance
requirement,
though,
i
believe
would
relate
to
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border
and,
on
that
basis,
where
it
is--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
that
is
correct.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
don't
think
that's
the
case.
i
think--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
think
the
point
should
not
have
been
left
up
to
the
individual
officer
as
such.
i
think
that
the
problem
stems
from
his
superiors,
from
the
attorneys
working
in
passing--
in
creating
these
rules
and
regulations
pursuant
to
the
statute,
and
i
feel
that
they,
at
all
times,
realize
that
they
were
rather
in
a
precarious
position.
however,
looking
to
the
recent
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
possibly
felt
that
until
some
alternative
better
than
this
comes
up
we'll
do
what
we
can
as
long
as
we
can.
and,
on
that
basis,
the
interpretation
has
been
unreasonable
through
its
application,
wherein,
other
sections
of
the
statute
require
probable--
not
probable
cause,
but
require
recognition
of
the
fourth
amendment
requirements.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
courts,
for
a
short
period
of
time,
held
that
the
statute
could
be
read
devoid
to
the
constitution.
and,
i
feel
that
this
is
not
a
new
rule
where
a
statute
must
be
read
in
recognition
of
the
higher
law
of
the
land
being
the
constitution.
so,
the
question
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
new
rule
that
the--
a
law
or
a
statute
passed
must
be
read
in
recognition
of
the
constitution.
that
is
not
a
new
rule.
it's
been
with
us
from
the
beginning
of
our
legal
history
and,
on
that
basis,
we
have
to
look
to
carroll
versus
the
united
states
as
establishing
the
rule
by
this
court.
it
has
not
been
modified
by
this
court,
but
merely
reaffirmed
by
the
case
in
almeida-sanchez.
additionally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
border
patrol
agents,
upon
examination,
have
stated
that
the
sole
basis
for
their
stopping
mr.
peltier
is
that
he
appeared
to
be
of
a
mexican
descent.
this,
in
itself,
is
invidious
discrimination
to
stop
and
search
a
car
because
a
person
appears
to
be
of
mexican
descent.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
don't
feel
that
they
could
tell
that
he
spoke
spanish
until
they
did
stop.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
have
a
little
problem
with
the
analogy
because
i
couldn't
understand
how
they
would
know
that
he
spoke
spanish
until
they
made
the
stop
and,
at
that
point,
violated
his
constitutional
right
through
this
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
think
that
the
courts
have
held
that
discrimination
based
upon
apparent
national
origin
is
invidious
discrimination
and
because
a
person
speaks
spanish
is
justification
for
the
stop,
i
feel
that
that
is
just
one
step
away
from
mexican
descent
and
is
just
another
justification
for
this
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
believe
that
the
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
has
established
that
the
border
patrolman
cannot
do
this
without
probable
cause.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
established
that
a
person's
national
origin
or
his
ancestry
must
remain
a
neutral
factor
and
not
be
considered
by
the
court,
as
it
would
raise
an
issue
of
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
no,
being
stopped
at
the
border
i
think
is
a--
quite
a
different
matter,
as
i've
stated--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
now,
the
government
has
a
need
and
the
public
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
country,
in
that
integrity
is
maintained
through
controlling
what
is
coming
into
the
country.
now,
we
do
not
have
a
situation
felt
here.
we
have
a
stop
of
a
person,
north
of
the
second
largest
city
in
california,
and
the
sole
basis
is
because
he--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
if
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
person
had
crossed
the
border,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
think
that
the
proximity
to
the
border
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
reasonableness,
using
the
reasonableness
standard
that's
set
out
in
the
dissent.
i
think
that
the
distance
from
the
border,
in
addition
to
the
distance
of
the
route
or
the
proximity
to--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
i
believe
that
the
question
of
reasonableness
can
be
raised
in
as
much
as--
mr.
sandor
w.
shapery
well,
it's
pointed
out
in
the
government's
case
in
bowen,
on
page
11
note
6,
that
if
a
party
prevails
in
a
lower
decision,
they
can
bring
up
any
basis
or
any
ground
upon
which
to
additionally
make
a
determination
on
that
case.
the
issue
of
reasonableness
has
been
maintained
from
the
trial
court
level.
i
wish
to
also
point
out
that
all
circuit
courts
who
have
ever
addressed
themselves
to
this
issue,
that
is
the
fifth,
the
ninth,
and
the
tenth,
would
obtain
the
exact
same
result
in
pelteir
as
the
ninth
had.
and,
the
ninth
and
the
tenth
circuits
hold
that
the
law
now,
after
almeida-sanchez,
always
required
probable
cause
to
search
on
a
roving
patrol.
wherein,
almeida-sanchez
reaffirmed
the
rule
of
carroll
versus
the
united
states.
so,
on
that
basis,
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
lacking
probable
cause,
lacking
recognition
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
pelteir,
like
almeida-sanchez,
should
have
the
evidence
suppressed.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
has
always
required,
now
this
is
pre-almeida-sanchez,
have
always
required
at
least
a
founded
or
reasonable
suspicion
and,
since
june
25--
or
since
june
21,
1973,
it
required
probable
cause,
but
even
the
fifth
circuit
on
pre-almeida-sanchez
law
would
have
suppressed
the
evidence
in
peltier
because
it
did
not
even
comport
to
the
founded
or
reasonable
suspicion
requirements.
therefore,
lacking
probable
cause
or
even
if
founded
or
reasonable
suspicion,
all
the
circuits
would've
dismissed
peltier.
the
government,
in
this
situation,
attempted
to
apply
a
statute,
completely
devoid
of
the
fourth
amendment
requirements.
now,
the
ninth
circuit,
for
a
period
of
time,
went
along
with
the
immigration
and
nationality
service.
however,
the
fifth
circuit,
at
all
times,
refused
to
go
along
with
recognizing--
or
without
recognizing
the
fourth
amendment
at
all,
and
they
attempted
to
carve
an
exception
to
carroll
versus
the
united
states
by
requiring
a
founded
suspicion
and
applying,
therefore,
a
minimal
fourth
amendment
recognition.
now,
to
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit
would
be
to
allow
all
circuit
courts
to
establish
their
own
constitutional
exceptions
until
overturned
by
this
court.
i
feel
that
to
so
do
that
would
create
chaos
in
the
lower
court
decisions
giving
them
authority
to
carve
exceptions
to
rules
established
by
this
court
and
justify
those
exceptions
until
the
issue
is
brought
to
this
court
and
reviewed
and
overturned.
constitutional
rule
should
begin
with
the
supreme
court
and
they
should
end
with
the
supreme
court.
and,
as
occurred
in
the
case
of
carroll
versus
united
states
and
reaffirmed
by
almeida-sanchez,
peltier's
case
should
be
affirmed.
