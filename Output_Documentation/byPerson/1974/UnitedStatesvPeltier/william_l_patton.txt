mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
one
of
four
cases
that
will
be
argued
today
concerning
issues
related
to
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
against
the
united
states
decided
june
21,
1973.
in
almeida-sanchez,
this
court
held
that
warrantless
searches
of
automobiles
for
concealed
illegal
aliens
conducted
without
probable
cause
by
border
patrol
agents
on
roving
patrol
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
each
of
these
cases
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
questions
presented
in
ortiz
and
bowen,
nos.
73-2050
and
73-6848,
are
whether
almeida-sanchez
should
be
extended
to
searches
conducted
at
fixed
check
points
and,
if
so,
whether
the
extension
should
apply
to
searches
conducted
before
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
united
states
against
bowen.
the
question
presented
in
brignoni-ponce,
no.
74-114,
is
whether
the
warrantless
stop
of
an
automobile
by
border
patrol
officers
violates
the
fourth
amendment
and
requires
the
suppression
of
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
the
stop
but
without
any
subsequent
search.
the
sole
issue
presented
in
this
case,
united
states
against
peltier,
no.
73-2000,
is
whether
almeida-sanchez
should
be
given
retroactive
effect.
the
prior
proceedings
of
this
case
are
set
forth
in
detail
in
our
brief
and
i
will
only
briefly
summarize
them
here.
on
march
7,
1973,
respondent
was
indicted
for
possession
of
approximately
270
lbs.
of
marijuana
with
intent
to
distribute
in
violation
of
title
21
of
the
united
states
code.
he
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
marijuana,
claiming
that
the
search
of
his
automobile
had
violated
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
motion
was
denied
after
a
hearing.
the
evidence
showed
that
on
february
28,
1973,
at
approximately
2:30
in
the
morning,
the
respondent's
automobile
was
stopped
by
border
patrol
agents
on
roving
patrol
near
temecula,
california.
the
stop
occurred
on
highway
395
at
a
point
of
approximately
70
air-miles
north
of
the
mexican
border.
the
agents
testified
that
they
had
stopped
the
respondent's
car
because
he
was
driving
an
old-modeled
car
and
because
he
appeared
to
be
a
mexican
man.
at
the
agent's
request,
the
trunk
was
opened
to
permit
them
to
inspect
the
presence
of
concealed
illegal
aliens.
although
no
aliens
were
discovered,
the
agents
did
find
270
lbs.
of
marijuana
in
plastic
bags
in
the
trunk
of
the
car.
the
respondent
was
tried
on
stipulated
facts.
he
stipulated,
among
other
things,
that
he
possessed
the
marijuana
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
the
stipulation
contained
a
proviso
that
it
would
not
have
been
entered
into
if
his
motion
to
suppress
had
been
granted
and
he
reserves
his
right
to
appeal
the
question
“suppression
motion.”
the
district
court
found
the
respondent
guilty
and
sentenced
him
to
prison
term
of
one
year
and
one
day
subject
to
immediate
parole
eligibility
and
to
special
parole
term
of
two
years.
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
and
back,
by
a
7-6
vote,
reversed
the
conviction
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
suppress
the
marijuana.
we
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
search
of
respondent's
automobile
was
invalid
under
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez,
but
we
urge
there
as
we
urge
here
that
almeida-sanchez
should
not
be
given
retroactive
effect.
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
need
not
reach
the
retroactivity
issue
because,
in
its
view,
almeida-sanchez
did
not
establish
a
new
rule.
the
majority
concede
that
numerous
since
its
decision,
since
1961,
had
contained
language
from
which
the
government
would
infer
that
the
court
would
uphold
a
roving
patrol
search,
but
the
majority
distinguished
this
language
as
dicta
apparently
on
the
ground
that
many
of
these
cases
involve
checked
point
searches.
the
majority
also
conceded
that,
in
1970,
it
had
upheld
the
roving
patrol
search
in
its
decision
in
united
states
against
miranda
and
again
in
almeida-sanchez
itself.
it
also
noted
that
the
tenth
circuit
had
uphold--
upheld
a
roving
patrol
search
in
roa-rodriguez,
but
the
majority
said
these
decisions
enjoyed
only
a
brief
acceptance.
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
in
conflict
with
united
states
against
miller,
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
pending
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
no.
73-6975.
the
ninth
circuit
also
reached
the
opposite
result
in
united
states
against
bowen.
the
only
difference
between
bowen
and
this
case
is
that
bowen
involved
the
checkpoint
search
and,
there,
the
majority,
again
by
a
7-6
vote,
founded
almeida-sanchez
had
overruled
clear
past
precedent.
the
tenth
circuit
has
given
almeida-sanchez
retroactive
effect
in
the
case
of
checkpoint
searches
and,
presumably,
it
would
give
a
retroactive
effect
in
the
case
of
roving
patrol
searches.
we
submit
that
almeida-sanchez
did,
indeed,
establish
a
new
rule
that
overruled
past
court
of
appeals
precedent
and
a
long-established
practice
and--
that
under
principles
of
this
court's
retroactivity
decisions
and
other
principles
of
exclusionary
rule
policy
itself,
almeida-sanchez
should
not
be
given
retroactive
effect,
that
is
it
should
not
apply
to
searches
conducted
before
june
21,
1973,
the
date
on
which
it
was
decided.
support
for
roving
patrol
searches
prior
to
almeida-sanchez
was
both
judicial
and
statutory.
section
1357
of
title
8
authorized
immigration
and
naturalization
service
officers
without
a
warrant,
within
a
reasonable
distance
from
any
external
border
of
the
united
states,
to
board
and
search
any
vehicle
or
conveyance
for
illegal
aliens.
in
regulations
promulgate
under
the
statute,
the
attorney
general
had
defined
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
border
to
be
any
point
within
100
air-miles
from
an
external
boundary.
and,
we
believe
that
the
statute
alone,
in
the
absence
of
a
contrary
judicial
construction,
would
be
sufficient
basis
for
reliance
by
law
enforcement
officers
and
would
present
a
retroactivity
question
and,
that,
we
believe
is
the
thrust
of
this
court's
plurality
opinion
in
lemon
against
kurtzman,
declining
to
give
retroactive
effect
to
its
prior
decision
holding
a
pennsylvania
statute
unconstitutional
that
provided
public
aid
to
non-public
sectarian
schools.
but,
we
do
not
rely
on
the
statute
alone
because
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
was
upheld
in
numerous
decisions
in
the
fifth,
ninth,
and
tenth
circuits.
the
ninth
circuit
distinguished
many
of
these
cases
as
dicta,
as
i
said,
presumably
on
the
ground
that
they
involved
checkpoint
searches,
but
the
language
in
those
decisions
was
not
so
limited.
and,
prior
to
almeida-sanchez,
there
was
no
distinction
drawn
in
the
case
law
between
checkpoint
searches
and
roving
patrol
searches,
and
the
majority
of
the
ninth
circuit
conceded
that
its
cases
contained
language
from
which
the
government
might
infer
that
roving
patrol
searches
would
be
upheld
and
that,
of
course,
is
precisely
what
happened.
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
roving
patrol
searches
in
miranda
and
almeida-sanchez,
the
tenth
circuit
in
its
decision
in
united
states
against
roa-rodriguez,
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
decision
in
united
states
against
miller.
mr.
justice
powell's
concurring
opinion
in
almeida-sanchez
recognized
this
consistent
judicial
approval.
he
wrote
the
roving
automobile
searches
in
border
regions
for
aliens
had
been
consistently
approved
by
the
judiciary,
and
mr.
justice
white's
dissenting
opinion
also
recognized
this
prior
judicial
approval
for
he
observed
that
the
courts
have
consistently
and
almost
without
dissent
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
is
embodied
in
the
judgment
that
is
reversed
today.respondent
himself
recognized,
at
the
time
of
his
suppression
motion,
that
the
state
of
the
law
sustained
roving
patrol
stops
and
searches
for
concealed
illegal
aliens.
in
the
district
court,
he
contended
that
while
it
was
permissible
to
stop
and
search
for
aliens,
once
border
patrol
agents
discovered
no
illegal
aliens,
they
then
were
required
to
go
no
further
even
though
they
observed
the
marijuana
in
the
trunk
of
the
car.
for
example,
at
page
23
of
the
appendix,
respondent's
counsel
say
to
the
court
“now,
if
agent
ansco
had
felt
the
bag
to
see
if
there
was
an
alien
in
there,
i
would
say,
fine,
we
do
not
have
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.”
respondent
did
ask
that
his
case
be
stayed
pending
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez,
but
that
is
simply
recognition
that
he
needed
a
change
in
the
law.
the
only
additional
factors
which
could
be
required
are
either
a
prior
decision
by
court
or
additional
court
of
appeals
opinions,
but
neither
requirement
is
sound.
there
is
no
support
in
this
court's
decisions
for
the
proposition
that
a
decision
must
overrule
a
prior
precedent
of
this
court
before
a
retroactivity
issue
is
presented.
in
chevron
oil
against
huson,
for
example,
this
court
declined
to
give
retroactive
effect
to
rodriguez
against
setting
a
casualty
even
though
rodriguez
had
overruled
only
a
long
line
of
fifth
circuit
opinions.
mr.
william
l.
patton
other
than
chevron,
i
don't
think
of
any--
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
was
a
civil
case.
mr.
william
l.
patton
but
in
linkletter,
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
court
indicated
that
it
saw
no
difference
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
for
purposes
of
retroactivity.
i
think--
we
believe
that
the
majority
opinion
in
bowen
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
correct
analysis
on
this
point.
every
issue
cannot
be
brought
to
this
court
and,
by
necessity,
a
number
of
important
issues
of
law
enforcement
must
be
litigated
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
we
disagree
about
that,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
believe
that
it's
true,
this
court's
opinion
in
almeida-sanchez
relied
on
prior
fourth
amendment
precedent,
but
there
was
an
intervening
federal
statute
which
we
believe
the
law
enforcement
officers
were
entitled
to
rely
on
until
courts
declared
otherwise.
and,
this
issue
was
litigated
in
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
fifth,
ninth,
and
tenth
circuits
and
the
government
never
lost
the
issue.
now,
we
rely
on
this
court's
opinion
in
lemon
against
kurtzman
that
statutory
or
even
judge-made
rules
of
law
are
hard
facts
on
which
people
must
rely
in
making
decisions
and
in
shaping
their
conduct,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
border
patrol
did.
roving
patrols
were
extensively
used
in
the
mexican
border
area
prior
to
almeida-sanchez.
for
example,
we
are
informed
that
in
fiscal
year
1972,
approximately
240,000
man-hours
were
devoted
to
highway
surveillance
of
roving
patrol
searches--
roving
patrol
activities.
we
believe
that
almeida-sanchez
did
establish
a
new
rule,
that
it
was
a
clear
break
with
the
past
and,
under
this
court's
retroactivity
decisions
and
under
exclusionary
rule
policy
itself,
it
should
not
be
given
retroactive
effect.
this
court's
decisions
have
established
three
tests.
the
first
and
most
important
of
those
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule
itself.
and,
uniformly,
this
court's
decisions
involving
the
exclusionary
rule
had
declined
to
give
exclusionary
rule
decisions
retroactive
effect.
whether
the
rule,
as
viewed
as
directed
at
conforming
police
conduct
or
addendicating
the
right
of
privacy
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
in
either
case,
there
is
no
effect
on
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
neither
purpose
is
advanced
by
retroactive
application.
the
second
two-test,
the
extent
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
officers
and
the
disruption
of
the
administration
of
justice
that
would
result
from
retroactive
application,
are
looked
to
only
when
the
first--
when
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
neutral
as
to
retroactivity.
as
we've
indicated,
that
purpose
is
not
neutral
but,
looking
to
those
tests,
there
was
widespread
reliance
on
the
authority
to
conduct
roving
patrol
searches
and,
as
for
disruption,
there
are
approximately
40
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeal
that
involve
almeida-sanchez
roving
patrol
issues.
there
are
an
indeterminate
number
of
cases
in
the
district
courts
and,
of
course,
there
would
be
a
large
number
of
cases
affected
in
collateral
attack
proceedings
if
almeida-sanchez
were
given
retroactive
effect.
so,
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
almeida-sanchez
should
not
be
applied
to
searches
conducted
before
the
date
that
it
was
decided
and
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
like
to
make
a
few
quick
remarks.
first
of
all,
we're
not
talking
about
the
government's
unilateral
conduct
establishing
a
rule.
there
was
a
federal
statute
that
had
been
construed
in
all
of
the
circuits
that
encompassed
jurisdictions
bordering
on
the
republic
of
mexico.
we
disagree
with
respondent's
analysis
of
the
decisions
of
the
fifth,
ninth,
and
tenth
circuits
and
we
say
it
is
simply
not
true
that
there
is
any
requirement
of
probable
cause
for
immigration
searches
prior
to
almeida-sanchez.
the
fumagalli
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which
is
discussed
in
justice
white's
dissenting
opinion
in
almeida-sanchez,
is
representative
of
the
ninth
circuit
decisions.
they
drew
a
distinction
between
contraband
searches
for
which
they
required
probable
cause
and
immigration
searches.
in
immigration
searches
relying
on
the
statute,
they
did
not
require
probable
cause.
the
same
is
true
with
the
fifth
circuit.
if
you
look
at
the
miller
decisions
and
the
wright
decision
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
you
will
see
that
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
is
that
the
test
is
where
the
search
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
but
it
was
not
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion.
if
it
was,
it
was
no
more
than
a
requirement
that
border
patrol
officers
search
only
compartments
large
enough
to
conceal
illegal
aliens.
and,
as
to
the
reasonableness
issue
which
respondent
has
brought
up
in
his
argument,
i
don't
believe
that
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unfortunately,
i
don't
have
the
briefs
here,
and
i
don't
think
it
should
be
considered
now
but,
in
any
event,
under
the
prior
law--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
he
would--
ordinarily,
this
court
would
not
consider
an
issue
that
was
not
raised.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
let
me
assume,
mr.
justice
white,
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
it
can
be
raised
now
even
so,
as
we've
said,
that
under
all
the
decisions
in
the
ninth,
tenth,
and
fifth
circuits
there
is
simply
nothing
to
decline
that
the
search
was
unreasonable
under
prior
law,
prior
to
almeida-sanchez.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
mr.
justice
white,
at
temecula,
where
this
search
was
conducted,
we
did
operate
a
checkpoint
there
for
a
period
in
1974
under
an
area
warrant.
unfortunately,
in
october
of
1974,
the
district
court
in
the
central
district
of
california
refused
to
renew
the
warrant
on
the
ground
that
it
lacked
the
authority
to
give
an
area
warrant.
we
didn't
go
up
on
that
case,
but
we
have
taken
the
issue
up
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
mr.
evans
will
discuss
this
in
more
detail
in
his
argument
in
united
states
and
bowen.
