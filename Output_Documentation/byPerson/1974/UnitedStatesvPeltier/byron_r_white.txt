do
you
think
the

authorizes--
authorized
the
search
and
escape?

that
isn't
what
i
asked
you,
is
it?
justice
byron

white
i
asked
you
whether
a
statute
authorized
the--
purported
to
authorize
the
search
in
this
case.
justice

had
it
ever
been
held
unconstitutional
before

justice

white
let's
assume
a
statute,
in
so
many
words,
authorizes
a
particular
kind
of
search,
and
the
officers
who
had
been
operating
under
and
performing
in
accordance
with
its
terms.
so,
everybody
held
it
unconstitutional
and
then
the
court
declares
it
unconstitutional.
now,
what
about
the
retroactivity
in
that
context?

well,
why
isn't
he
entitled
to
defend
the
decision
below

any
ground
that

expand
his
relief?
justice

well,
we
would.
ordinarily,
we
would
if
our
respondent
to
be
defending
a
decision
below
on
the
ground--
even
if
it
was
rejected
below,
we
could.
justice
byron

if
he
doesn't
try
to
expand
his
judgment.
justice
byron
r.

could
i
ask
you
a
question.
i
might
as
well
ask
you
now
as
in
some
of
the
later
case.
is
the
government
seeking
to
get
any
kind
of
an
area
