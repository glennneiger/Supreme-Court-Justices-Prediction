justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
the
sunol
opera?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
temecula
is
inland
from
sunol.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
you
talking
about,
the
second
largest
city
in--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
san
diego?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that's
no
guarantee
that
he
might
not
have
aliens
in
the
backseat.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
they
stopped
him
because
he
spoke
spanish?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
they
had
in
fact
stopped
him
because
he
spoke
spanish.
i
said
what
if
they
had
stopped
him
because
he
spoke
spanish.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
feel
that
speaking--
stopping
a
person
for
speaking
spanish
is
of
the
same
order,
and
your
apparent
scale
of
values
is
stopping
a
person
because
he
appear
to
be
of
mexican
descent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
job
of
the
border
patrol
to
figure
out
who
are
illegal
aliens
from
mexico
and
who
are
people
either
lawfully
admitted
aliens
or
united
states
citizens
that
they
don't
have
any
business
with?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
what
are
the
elements
of
probable
cause?
you
apparently
rule
out
both
speaking
spanish
and
the
appearance
of
a
mexican
nationality.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
he
is
stopped
at
the
border,
they
can't
ask
him
his
national
ancestry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
should
think
it
would
be
as
invidious
there
as
it
would
be
any
place
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
it
be
invidious
at
the
border?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
be,
say,
10
miles
inland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
the
possession
of
marihuana
which
was
seized
by
border
patrol
agents
during
a
search
of
his
car
70
miles
from
the
mexican
border.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
against
united
states
two
terms
ago,
which
issued
four
months
after
the
search
of
the
respondent's
car
should
be
applied
to
suppress
the
270
pounds
of
marihuana
found
by
border
patrol
agents.
we
granted
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
because
of
a
conflict
between
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuits
on
this
issue.
the
government
did
not
contest
the
finding
that
the
search
was
illegal,
but
contended
that
the
purposes
underlying
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
be
furthered
by
the
suppression
of
the
evidence
in
this
case.
we
find
this
argument
persuasive.
searches
of
the
variety
involved
in
this
case
were
authorized
by
statute
and
regulation
and
were
continuously
approved
by
circuit
courts
until
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez.
the
deterrence
objectives
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
be
furthered
by
suppression
of
the
evidence
involved
in
this
case
nor
were
the
imperatives
of
judicial
integrity
offended
by
the
use
of
this
evidence
in
respondent's
trial.
we
therefore,
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
and
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
part
i
of
that
opinion
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
