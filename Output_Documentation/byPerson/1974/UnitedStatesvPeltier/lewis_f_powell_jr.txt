justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
shapery,
what
do
you
perceive
to
be
the
principal
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think,
in
calandra,
we
said
that
the
principal
purpose
of
that
rule
was
to
deter
future
police
misconduct.
the
rule
that
you
advocate
here
today
would
not
be
relevant
to
that,
would
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
do
you
think
that
where
there
is
a
statute
enacted
by
the
congress
that,
i
think
you
conceded
earlier,
authorized
this
type
of
stop
and
search
should
be
rejected
by
policemen
on
their
own
initiative
before
this
court
decides
it's
unconstitutional?
