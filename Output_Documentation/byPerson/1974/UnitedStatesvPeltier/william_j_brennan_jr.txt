william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
was
even
reasonable,
although
the
courts
of
appeals
said
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
the
statute
requires
probable
cause
for
a
search
at
the
border?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
the
same
section
that
authorizes
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
same
section,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
refers
to
a
search
with--
at
the
border
or
reasonable
distance
from
the
border.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
it's
the
same
statute
that
authorizes
these--
the
examination
at
the
border
or
authorizes
an
examination
at
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
border.
are
you
suggesting
the
statute
requires
probable
cause
at
the
border?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
probable
cause
at
the
border?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
statute,
on
its
face,
purports
to
authorize
the
same
kind
of
a
search
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
border
as
it
does
at
the
border
as
you,
i
thought,
indicated
earlier
in
our
conversation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
so
that
the
border
patrol
officer
does
have
or
did
have
some
thought
that
the
statute
authorized
a
warrantless
and
non-probable
cause
searches,
although
not
particularly--
not
exactly
at
the
border.
and,
it's
a
rather
old
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
point
may
be
that
it
isn't
a
functional
equivalent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
another
matter,
but
this--
if
it
were,
it
wouldn't
have
to
have
probable
cause.
