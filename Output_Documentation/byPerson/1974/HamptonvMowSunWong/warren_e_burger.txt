chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1596,
hampton
against
mow
sun
wong.
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
right
to
vote
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
can
be
denied.
it
is
denied,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
steinman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
by
the
choice
of
the
federal
government,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren't
we
talking
about
constitutional
power
here
if
the
government
wanted
to
in
any
particular
department
assuming
that
mr.
bork,
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
entirely
correct
they
can
waive
it
with
respect
to
any
particular
department
or
employment
can?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
about
your
argument
on
discrimination.
do
we
not
discriminate
against
aliens
when
we
classify
them
in
a
way
that
they
must
apply
for
citizenship
so
that
the
very
denial
of
citizenship
benefits
until
they
take
some
step
which
native
born
american
need
not
take
it
is
a
form
of
discrimination,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
kind
of
a
case
was
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you
have
to
say
about
mr.
--
what
the
solicitor
general's
point
but
congress
would
have
plenary
power
to
attach
conditions
to
the
original
entry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
putting
excluding
them
entirely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
government
has
solved
that
problem
by
picking
and
choosing
which
alien
it
wants
in
the
past,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
deny
itself
the
pool.
it
picks
and
chooses
wong
or
von
braun
or
various
other
people
when
they
have
a
great
need
for
the
protective
services?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
steinman,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
steinman.
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1596,
hampton
against
wong.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
congress
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
congress,
mr.
solicitor
general,
enact
a
statute
now
that
hereafter
all
aliens
admitted
to
this
country
must
apply
for
citizenship
within
five
years
or
be
deported?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
apply
it
then
to
persons
who
had
been
in
the
united
states
before
the
enactment
of
that
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
those
illustrations
of
the
kind
of
plenary
power
you
suggest
congress
has
over
aliens
as
aliens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
atomic
energy
commission
would
be
under
that
blanket
too,
would
it
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
there
aliens
employed
in
the
atomic
energy
commission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
steinman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
your
answer
to
the
hypothetical
about
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
the
statute
that
is
required
aliens
a
-
to
learn
the
language
of
the
country
so
that
they
can
pass
the
test
within
five
years
and
apply
for
citizenship
within
five
years
or
b
-
deported
at
the
end
of
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
no
one
has
questioned,
that
i
am
aware
of,
the
power
of
the
united
states
government
to
hire
aliens
if
they
want
to.
that
is
not
involved
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
statutory
exceptions
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
statesâ€™
own
interests,
are
they
not?
that
is,
if
we
want
to
hire
or
the
united
states
want
to
hire
wernher
von
braun
or
other
scientist,
the
united
states
surely
has
plenary
power
to
waive
these
considerations,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
would
have
helped
or
would
it
help
this
regulation
of
the
civil
service
commission
if,
as
congress
often
does,
recited
a
series
of
preambles
consideration
for
enacting
the
regulation.
one
for
example,
that
it
wanted
to
encourage
people
to
apply
promptly
for
citizenship;
two,
that
it
intended
to
reserve
federal
employment
for
american
citizens,
because,
at
the
present
time,
studies
have
shown
that
there
are
10
or
11
illegal
aliens
in
the
united
states
and
in
addition
to
many
aliens
legally
in
the
united
states;
and
third,
that
federal
government
programs
of
affirmative
action
to
remedy
past
discrimination
will
be
served
by
limiting
federal
employment
to
naturalized
or
native-born
citizens.
would
that
take
care
of
the
flaws
you
see
in
this
regulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
going
to
your
point
that
congress
has
not
done
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
civil
service
commission
has
done
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
that
the
affirmative
action
programs
are
sufficient
consideration
even
though
presumably
every
time
an
alien
that
fills
a
civil
service
position,
it
is
one
less
position
available
for
either
american
citizens
or
for
american
citizens
perhaps
subject
to
the
affirmative
action
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying,
mr.
steinman,
that
limiting
federal
employment,
the
employment
in
government,
to
citizens
of
the
sovereign
is
not
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
or
are
you
saying
that,
assuming
that
it
is,
there
has
been
no
action
taken
by
the
sovereign
to
so
declare
that
is
the
national
policy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
an
attribute
of
sovereignty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
state
it;
i
ask
you
for
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
why
is
not
a
limitation
of
government
employment
to
citizens
an
act
of
the
government
relating
to
naturalization?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
it
does
not
constitute
an
answer
to
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
steinman.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i,
for
some
reason,
cannot
seem
to
find
it.
