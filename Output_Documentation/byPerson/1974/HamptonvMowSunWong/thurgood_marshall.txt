mr.
solicitor
general,
did
the
congress
passed
and
not
giving
the
states
the
right
to
discriminate
against
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
is
a
limitation
on
congress'
authority
over
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
congress
authorize
the
civil
service
commission
to
pay
the
aliens
less
than
they
pay
citizens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
congress
pass
a
law
and
it
says,
“you
pay
female
aliens
less
than
you
pay
other?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
say
that
the
work
loss
of
the
united
states
do
not
apply
to
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
such
a
little
niche
that
they
do
whatever
they
want
on
employment
but
anything
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
as
the
first
case
it
was
about
employment
through
acts,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
case
before
that
and
had
anybody
else
in
a
suspect
classification
when
the
alien
is
the
first
one
to
made
suspect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn't
apply
for
citizenship?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
apply
for
citizenship?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
it
be
automatic
if
he
had
applied
for
as
a
veteran?
it
would
have
been
no
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
your
client
they're
willing
to
take
the
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
defend
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
of
them
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
said
one
had
certainly
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
not
objection
on
the
employee
direct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
does
equal
protection
(inaudible)
left
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
could
be
said
in
so
long
as
it
is
within
the
protection
clause.
there
would
be
nothing
contrary
about
that,
would
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
you
agree.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
a
case
of
immigrant
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
points
an
alien
in
a
different
category?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
in
a
different
category.
justice
thurgood
marshall
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
aliens
cannot
be
excluded
from
this
country
but
you
cannot
exclude
an
american-born
from
this
country.
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
you
come
in
the
country,
you
are
still
an
alien
until
you
become
a
citizen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
and
there
is
a
difference
between
a
resident
alien
and
a
citizen.
