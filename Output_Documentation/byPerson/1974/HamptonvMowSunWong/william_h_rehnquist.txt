justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
the
extent
mr.
steinman
you
say
congress
has
plenary
power
over
conditions
of
naturalization
to
the
extent
your
argument
were
followed
here.
i
take
it
congress
would
not
have
a
great
deal
to
do
in
that
area.
there's
very
little
it
can
do
to
distinguish
between
people
who
are
naturalized
and
people
who
are
simply
resident
aliens
and
haven't
sought
naturalization.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
this
court
ever
found
that
the
government
was
able
to
show
a
compelling
interest
where
the
compelling
interest
test
was
applied?
