mr.
edward
h.
steinman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
well,
counsel
for
the
government
is
suggesting
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
carved
out
a
novel
constitutional
argument.
his
argument
concerning
the
non-applicability
of
fifth
amendment
protections
to
aliens
when
the
classification
is
an
alienage,
i
would
submit
it's
the
most
novel
of
arguments.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
four
respondents
in
this
case
were
initially
seeking
jobs
that
did
not
involve
foreign
affairs,
did
not
involve
national
security,
did
not
involve
some
of
the
issues
of
sovereignty
and
some
of
the
issues
of
executive
policymaking
which
was
the
concern
to
this
court
in
sugarman.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
think
the
vice
of
the
regulation
is
similar
to
the
vice
of
the
regulation
which
confronted
this
court
in
sugarman.
or
immediately
the
state
case
and
as
the
lower
court
found
and
that's
where
a
controlling.
the
vice
was
the
overbreadth
that
while
there
are
clearly
jobs
which
possibly
because
of
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
agree
that
it
would
be
obviously
best
not
to
strike
on
a
statute
but
the
interpretation
of
the
regulation
has
been
to
automatically
foreclose
at
the
stage
of
submitting
an
application.
any
none
--
any
resident
alien,
i'd
like
to
make
one
correction
of
the
opening
remarks.
the
regulation
in
question
says
that
you
must
be
a
citizen
or
of
permanent
allegiance
as
the
government's
brief
at
page
81,
note
67
of
its
brief
indicates.
the
government
has
interpreted
permanent
allegiance
to
only
apply
to
american
samoans.
but
possibly
mr.
justice
white
if
the
government
was
more
liberal
in
interpreting
permanent
allegiance
we
could
say
the
regulation
it
is
chosen
not
to
do
so.
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
is
that
three
of
the
four
name
respondents
actually
at
one
time
work
for
the
federal
government.
respondent
wong
and
respondent
mok
were
involved
in
a
federal
state
manpower
program
and
were
placed
for
the
general
services.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
the
laws
indicate
that
there
are
exceptions
from
many
branches
of
government
including
department
of
defense,
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
nasa,
department
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
clearly.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
exactly,
and
the
point
i'm
wishing
to
make
is
that
these
individuals
performed
competently
and
performed
as
the
service
wishes
to
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service
while
working
on
other
programs
and
yet
although
the
supervisors
of
the
record
indicates
that
they
performed.
one
performed
outstandingly.
the
other
performed
most
satisfactory.
when
the
time
came
when
the
government
program
ended,
they
were
foreclosed
totally
from
seeking
and
continuing
their
jobs
solely
under
status
as
alien.
mr.
justice
powell
raised
another
issue
which
i'd
like
to
addressed
or
touched
into
in
the
record.
he
asked
about
veteran's
preferences.
there's
evidence
from
the
record
of
a
gentleman
named
mr.
bor,
it
appears
at
the
appendix
page
31;
it's
discussed
at
page
6
of
our
brief.
mr.
bor
arrived
in
this
country
as
a
child.
he
was
dropped
in
the
american
--
into
the
military
served
for
18
months,
14
of
which
were
in
korea;
achieved
the
rank
of
sergeant
e-5,
received
an
honorable
discharge.
and
yet
when
he
left
the
military
and
try
to
apply
just
apply
for
job
at
the
postal
service
to
which
he
had
been
a
citizen
he
would
receive
veteran's
preference.
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
apply
and
as
he
states
in
his
affidavit,
“although
i'm
qualified
and
loyal
enough
to
serve
my
country
for
two
years
in
the
military,
i'm
not
qualified
and
loyal
enough
to
work
for
the
post
office.”
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
pardon?
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
at
that
time
he
had
not.
three
of
the
four
name
respondents
in
this
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
it
would've
been
under
the
rule
he
chose
not
to.
three
of
the
four
respondents
in
this
case
have
filed
declarations
of
intent
to
become
citizen.
obviously,
the
time
the
case
was
filed,
they
were
not
eligible
because
they
have
not
lived
here
requisite
number
of
years.
the
postal
service
has
now
changed
its
regulation
now
that
it
is
no
longer
under
the
umbrella
of
the
civil
service
commission.
it
now
allows
noncitizens
to
apply
on
the
same
basis
for
almost
all
positions
in
the
postal
service.
i
submit
that
to
respond
to
mr.
bork's
argument
that
it
might
be
administratively
impossible
or
inconvenient
to
do
so.
the
postal
service
has
more
than
one
half
million
employees
and
yet
has
chosen
last
may
to
change
its
regulations
to
now
allow
noncitizens
to
apply
for
old
most
jobs.
as
far
as
the
equal
protection
clause,
clearly
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
bill
of
rights
although
not
explicitly
containing
equal
protection
statements
contains
equal
protection
principles.
this
court
said
in
the
same
day
they
issued
decision
in
brown
versus
board
of
education.
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
the
same
constitution
would
impose
a
lesser
duty
on
the
federal
government
that
imposes
on
the
state.
this
court
has
continued
to
make
sure
that
such
and
unthinkable
anomaly
does
not
occur
and
throughout
the
last
two
decades
has
applied
the
same
type
of
standards
and
the
same
type
approaches
in
regard
to
federal
discrimination
that
would've
apply
had
the
discrimination
been
practice
by
the
state.
last
term,
mr.
justice
brennan
speaking
for
this
court
said
in
johnson
versus
robison,
“if
a
classification
would
be
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
due
process
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment.”
mr.
bork
however
contends
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
apply
because
this
case
involves
the
federal
government
classifying
aliens
on
the
basis
of
their
alienage.
unfortunately,
such
statement
ignores
the
clear
holdings
of
this
court
in
the
last
four
years.
the
classifications
based
on
alienage
are
inherently
suspect.
not
just
sometimes
suspect
but
inherently
suspect
that
“aliens
as
a
class
are
prime
example
of
a
discreet
and
insular
minority
for
whom
heightened
judicial
solicitude
is
appropriate.”
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
why
this
court
reached
that
conclusion.
this
court
has
described
the
indicia
that
are
common
to
all
the
classes
which
have
been
deemed
suspect.
in
the
rodriguez
case,
this
court
said
that
such
heightened
judicial
solicitude
was
needed
because
these
individuals
are
“saddled
with
such
disabilities,
or
subjected
to
such
a
history
of
purposeful
and
equal
treatment,
or
relegated
to
such
a
position;
a
political
powerlessness
as
to
command
extraordinary
protection
from
the
majoritarian
political
process.”
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
griffiths
case
delineated
some
of
the
historical
hostility
that
has
been
heaved
upon
noncitizens.
the
scorn,
they
have
been
treated
as
constitutional
outcast.
this
court
has
recognized
that
most
states
today
do
not
allow
noncitizens
to
vote
that
they've
been
denied
to
franchise.
likewise,
the
fact
that
noncitizens
can
become
citizens
if
they
wish
to
exercise
the
option
given
to
them
by
congress
did
not
dissuade
this
case,
this
court
in
other
cases
in
sugarman.
two
with
the
four
appellees
chose
not
to
exercise
the
right
to
become
a
citizen.
mr.
justice
powell
in
griffiths,
explicitly
stated
that
mrs.
griffiths
chose
not
to
file
a
declaration
of
intent
even
in
graham
versus
richardson,
the
appellee
richardson
have
been
in
this
country
far
long
than
necessary
to
become
a
citizen.
if
the
fact
that
she
chose
not
to
become
a
citizen
also
was
have
no
important
to
this
court.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
classification
based
on
alienage
does
not
change
because
it's
the
federal
government.
this
court
has
continued
to
recognize
that
when
the
federal
government
itself
practices
discrimination.
it
is
bound
by
the
same
standard
and
the
same
protections
which
have
been
put
on
the
states
in
some
more
discrimination.
in
the
griffiths
case,
mr.
justice
powell
said
that
the
interests
has
been
characterized
but
the
government
must
show
in
many
ways
overriding,
compelling,
important,
substantial.
i'm
not
worried
about
pigeonhole
in
this
case,
in
any
of
those
words
as
the
court
said
we
attribute
no
particular
significance
to
these
variations
in
diction.
what
is
important
is
when
such
discrimination
exists;
the
government
has
a
duty
to
show
something
more
than
just
some
rational
basis.
although,
as
we
contend
even
under
that
more
differential
standard
as
the
ninth
circuit
find
in
this
case,
the
government
has
not
satisfied
its
duty.
i
just
like
to
make
one
remark
in
that
area.
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
government
has
employed
means
which
rationally
relate
to
some
governmental
purpose.
there's
only
one
purpose
in
this
case.
the
purpose
is
to
best
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
civil
service,
that's
a
direct
quote
from
5
u.s.c.
3301.
the
purpose
of
the
civil
service
system
is
to
overcome
the
spoils
which
historically
unfortunate
attached
the
government
employment.
the
purpose
of
a
civil
service
system
is
not
to
hire
citizens.
this
court
has
long
discarded
the
old
notion
of
a
special
public
interest.
the
purpose
is
to
have
an
efficient
government
and
there
is
nothing
about
being
a
noncitizen,
about
being
a
resident
alien
which
means
that
a
person
will
not
be
efficient,
will
not
be
a
competent
employee.
unfortunately,
my
clients
and
other
resident
aliens
throughout
the
country
are
not
even
given
the
right
to
apply,
are
not
even
given
the
right
to
go
through
the
normal
investigative
screening
process
which
show
whether
individual
is
efficient
for
the
job,
to
show
whether
the
individual
may
be
loyal.
i
do
not
deny
that
sometimes
the
person
because
of
his
noncitizen
status
may
not
be
loyal.
this
government
spends
millions
of
dollars
each
year
and
employs
tens
of
thousands
of
people
to
check
on
the
loyalty
of
citizens
for
certain
position.
my
client
wanted
to
be
treated
equally
in
that
sense.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
to
the
extent
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
three
of
them
have.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
three
of
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
no,
the
fourth
has
not
for
her
own
purpose
but
of
her
own
religious
belief
and
own
political
reasons.
and
i
don't
think
that
she
would
sign
it.
the
congress
does
not
require
in
the
passage
on
1952.
congress
required
that
resident
aliens
come
in
this
country
signed
a
declaration
of
intent
to
become
a
citizen.
the
1952
law
erased
that
requirement.
so
the
congress
itself
does
not
do
it.
i
would
think
there
probably
a
large
percentage
of
resident
aliens
would
be
willing
to
sign
that
oath.
unfortunately,
the
regulation
and
its
interpretation
by
the
civil
service
commission
preclude
that
possibility.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
when
i
say,
“refused”
she
has
not
chosen
the
option
which
congress
has
given
her.
it
is
not
in
the
records.
i'm
going
out
the
record
which
she
have
told
me
is
that
she
feels
that
she
is
a
citizen
of
the
world
and
that
she
doesn't
feel
that
she
owes
any
more
or
less
loyalty
to
any
country.
she
chooses
--
she
was
and
her
name
is
ms.
lum.
she
was
sought
by
hew
to
be
in
evaluator
of
education
programs.
she
has
15
years
of
teaching
experience.
she
has
one
master's
degree
and
studied
at
many
universities
including
stanford
and
seton
hall.
they
asked
her
to
apply,
she
couldn't.
her
point
right
after
why
did
she
become
a
--
why
didn't
she
become
a
citizen.
she
said
initially
she
didn't
for
political
reasons
because
it
might
have
harmed
her
family
in
china.
over
the
years
she
has
said
that
she
would
like
her
status
of
being
citizen
of
the
world.
congress
until
1952
requires
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that
she
feels
she
is
a
resident
in
united
states
but
in
our
conversation
she
has
not
stated
that
she
is
a
citizen
of
anyone
country.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
yes.
the
other
three
named
respondents
have
filed
declaration
of
intent
to
become
a
citizen
although
as
i
said
the
congress
no
longer
requires
it.
consequence
of
government
has
said
there
are
even
if
you
apply
assumes
the
more
differential
test.
he
says
that
it's
satisfied
by
various
interests
to
induce
people
to
become
citizens.
well,
i
would
assume
also
that
we
can
induce
people
become
citizens
by
not
allowing
into
work
for
state
governments.
such
a
factor
was
raised
before
this
court
and
obviously
not
found
dispositive.
also,
that
notion
of
administrative
burdens,
i
would
submit
that
administrative
burdens
are
both
legally
and
factually
relevant.
this
court
has
very
strongly
said
that
the
constitution
requires
higher
values
and
speed
and
efficiency
that
“this
has
been
a
frontiero
case
decided
in
1973.”
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
an
administrative
convenience
is
not
a
shibboleth.
the
mere
recitation
of
which
dictates
the
constitutionality.
i
would
also
point
this
court
to
page
28
of
our
brief
a
long
quote
from
mr.
justice
black
in
reid
versus
covert
where
he
said
that
“to
allow
an
argument
administrative
convenience
is
a
very
dangerous
doctrine
and
if
allowed
to
flourish
would
destroy
the
basis
of
a
written
constitution
and
undermine
the
basis
of
our
government.
i
also
submit
that
administrative
inconvenience
is
factually
irrelevant.
although,
there
are
millions
of
jobs
in
the
federal
civil
service
very
few
involved
the
type
of
policymaking
issues,
involved
the
type
of
responsibilities
which
this
court
recognize
in
sugarman
might
best
be
reserved
to
citizens.
i
also
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
u.s.
postal
service
which
employs
more
than
a
half
million
people
itself
has
found
that
it
could
change
its
regulations
is
another
example
that
administrative
inconvenience
even
if
legally
relevant
which
we
do
not
agree.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that's
right.
they
have
chosen
not
to.
they
have
chosen
to
issue
a
blanket
exclusion.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
yes,
i
think
the
answer
though
is
stems
--
well,
the
problem
which
you
raised
tends
some
with
confusion.
plenary
power
of
the
united
states
government
is
not
over
aliens
last
in
sugarman
at
page
646.
this
court
said,
“its
comprehensive
power
over
immigration
naturalization.”
and
to
the
extent
that
decisions
are
made
concerning
who
enters
this
country;
the
conditions
of
naturalization
whom
who
is
deported
that
is
to
what
the
plenary
power
addresses
itself.
but
as
this
court
stated
in
1970
and
i
quote
it's
at
page
39
of
the
brief
but
the
case
is
hellenic
lines
versus
rhodetis,
this
is
a
quote.
“the
bills
of
rights
is
a
futile
authority
for
the
alien
seeking
admission
for
the
first
time
to
these
shores.
but
once
an
alien
lawfully
enters
and
resides
in
this
country
he
becomes
invested
with
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
to
all
people
within
our
border.”
and
i
will
skip
a
few
sentences
and
go
on
to
the
last.
“the
constitution
extends
an
alien
of
privileges
to
all
persons
and
guards
against
any
encroachment
on
those
rights
by
federal
or
state
authority.
the
plenary
power
argument
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
this
was
a
case
concerning
benefits
under
the
jones
act
for
seaman
but
the
argument
was
made
that
because
the
person
was
only
a
lawfully
resident
alien
he
was
not
entitled
to
certain
benefits.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
think
that
is
probably
correct.
i
would
think
i
would
also
make
this
court
aware
that
congress
in
1965
by
statute
took
away
any
power
that
it
might
have
or
it
need
not
do
so
to
discriminate
against
incoming
aliens
the
basis
of
race
free
to
religion.
and
according
to
my
research
and
according
to
the
handbook
immigration
law
of
mr.
gordon
and
mr.
rosenfeld
there
are
currently
only
two
laws
on
the
books
which
condition
of
course
any
condition
an
alien
is
entering.
one
is
a
bond
for
those
who
might
become
dependent
in
the
welfare
system.
the
other
relates
to
aliens
who
might
otherwise
be
inadmissible.
i
agree
with
you
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
although
i
might
personally
not
like
that.
congress
can
attach
any
conditions
it
wishes
on
those
who
have
not
yet
entered
the
country.
one
of
the
key
factors
is
whether
or
not
someone
is
lawfully
here.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
think
so.
i
would
also
think
that
congress
could
even
say
that
you
enter
the
country
in
a
condition
you
can't
work
for
the
state
or
federal
--
for
the
state
government.
the
issue
in
this
case
involves
people
who
are
lawfully
here.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
there
are
many
distinction
between
naturalize
and
native
born
citizens
and
resident
aliens.
first
of
all,
i've
see
decisions
concerning
immigration
and
deportation
can
only
be
made
in
regard
to
resident
aliens.
citizens
are
not
covered
by
that.
second
of
all,
although
as
this
court
recognized
the
constitution
applies
to
both
citizens
and
noncitizens.
there
is
a
difference
on
how
the
constitution
applies.
if
you're
an
alien,
the
government
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case
can
suggest
possible
compelling
to
overwrite
the
interest
why
an
alien
can
be
discriminated
against.
if
you're
citizen,
there
is
no
interest
that
would
allow
the
government
to
discriminate
against
you
on
your
status
as
a
citizen.
because
you
are
a
citizen,
you
cannot
be
denied
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
employment.
you
may
be
denied
for
other
reasons
because
you
are
an
alien
you
may
under
the
constitution
be
denied
those
rights,
if
the
government
can
show
a
compelling
interest.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
am
not
aware
of
that
but
i
would
think
that
in
the
sugarman
case
you
explicitly
suggest
that
in
the
area
of
voting
and
the
area
of
holding
high
public
office
and
the
area
of
holding
positions
with
public
policy
and
confidential
components
that
the
government
might
be
able
to
satisfy
the
state
government,
might
be
able
to
satisfy
the
compelling
interest.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
in
this
case
it
doesn't
because
i
think
that
the
respondents
prevail
under
either
test
to
the
extent
that
the
choice
of
the
test
dictates
the
result
that
is
because
the
constitution
is
very
zealous
to
make
sure
that
members
of
suspect
classes
have
heightened
judicial
protection.
the
problem
in
this
case
of
course
is
not
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
can
for
certain
job
requires
citizenship.
we
don't
object
to
that,
we
think
it
can.
the
problem
here
is
the
blanket
exclusion
and
obviously
the
vice
of
overbreadth
is
very
serious.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that's
right.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
wouldn't
be
here
but
i
think
the
test
could
be
quite
different
and
i
think
this
court
would
give
more
difference
at
the
congressional
power.
as
our
brief
suggest,
we
don't
think
that
even
if
plenary
power
exist
that
it's
something
which
automatically
means
to
government
wins.
in
other
context,
this
court
has
said
that
you
cannot
invoke
a
plenary
power
as
“talismanic
incantation
to
support
the
exercise
of
any
congressional
power.”
but
clearly
if
we
are
in
the
area
of
the
plenary
power
in
regard
to
decisions
concerning
immigration
or
deportation,
i
would
think
that
the
government
would
have
a
much
easier
burden
to
satisfy.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that
is
under
the
plenary
power,
under
the
constitution
which
gives
congress
the
constitution
only
says
plenary
power
regarding
naturalization.
this
court
has
said
that
implicitly
contains
plenary
power
over
decisions
in
regard
to
immigration
and
deportation.
that's
for
the
plenary
power
is.
the
plenary
power
is
not
totally
over
aliens.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
this
court
has
over
in
the
last
two
decades
carved
out
some
substance
procedure
--
substance
due
process
protections
for
those
being
deported.
i'm
not
sure
that
like
example
you
give
would
satisfy
the
court
protection.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
totally
agree
and
fortunately
this
case
does
not
involve
resident
aliens
who
are
doing
something
wrong
but
involves
resident
alien
who
wish
to
work
for
the
government
and
use
his
skills
which
they
brought
with
them
in
the
best
ways.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
think
that
congress
exercises
power.
i
don't
think
it
exercise
powers
in
the
area
of
plenary
power
as
this
court
has
carved
out.
i
think
that
in
one
way
to
think
of
the
plenary
power's
argument
is
that
when
this
court
has
focused
on
issues
of
immigration
and
deportation
it
is
because
they
involved
issues
of
national
security,
they
involved
issues
of
foreign
affairs,
they
involved
issues
of
the
sovereignty
of
this
country
and
when
those
type
issues
are
intertwined
it
becomes
more
important
for
this
court
to
recognize
congress'
powers
given
by
the
constitution.
applying
for
federal
employment
as
a
janitor
or
applying
to
federal
employment
as
a
file
clerk
raises
no
issue
of
national
security,
it
raises
no
issue
of
foreign
affairs
and
i
think
that
is
the
distinction
which
has
to
be
made.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
she
was
sought
--
hew
asked
her
if
she
was
interested
in
being
an
evaluator
of
education
programs
and
on
their
request
she
sought
to
file
an
application
and
was
not
permitted
to
file
an
application.
and
should
it
turn
out
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
position
that
she
sought
might
involve
issues
of
national
security,
might
involve
the
type
of
executive
policymaking
which
was
concerning
to
this
court
and
into
the
sugarman
decision
and
quite
properly
she
might
be
foreclosed
in
that
position.
the
problem
is
that
the
regulation
as
it
reads
now
does
not
permit
that
decision
to
even
be
made.
it
cuts
her
off
at
the
start
before
anyone
can
inquire
into
her
application
or
abilities.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
you're
right.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
the
reid
case
mr.
justice
black
said
that
united
states
has
entirely
featured
the
constitution
and
its
power
and
authority
have
no
other
source.
my
one
observation
i
think
is
important
that
if
we
look
to
international
law
and
this
court
would
to
decide
of
the
sugarman
and
griffiths
cases
totally
the
other
way
because
the
international
law
does
not
permit
noncitizens
to
work
in
the
states
of
various
countries.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
but
those
that
are
would
not
reach
decisions
of
this
court
reached
sugarman.
likewise,
the
government
properly
said
that
this
type
of
regulation
has
been
in
the
books
for
nearly
hundred
years.
well,
clearly
as
this
court
has
said
that
no
one
requires
a
vested
or
protected
right
in
violating
the
constitution.
mr.
justice
burger
in
1970
in
the
williams
versus
illinois
case
i
think
said
at
best.
new
cases
exposed
all
the
infirmities
which
apathy
or
absence
of
challenge
is
permitted
to
stand
but
the
constitutional
imperative
of
equal
protection
clause
must
have
priority
over
the
comfortable
convenience
of
the
status
quo.
we
fill
very
strongly
that
ninth
circuit
was
entirely
correct
in
striking
on
these
regulations
as
being
unconstitutional.
we
also
feel
strong
as
our
brief
indicate
that
the
ninth
circuit
could've
avoid
to
the
constitutional
issue
by
finding
that
this
regulation
was
not
authorized
by
the
united
states
congress
or
the
president
of
the
united
states.
this
court
has
required
when
sensitive
individual
rights
are
involved
that
there
be
explicit
authorizations
when
the
executive
branch
issues
a
regulation
that
the
substantial
restraints
and
employment
opportunities
which
raise
issues
of
constitutional
mention
--
require
explicit
and
specific
authorization.
this
is
from
greene
versus
mcelroy.
in
this
situation,
there
is
no
congressional
authorization.
the
statutes
since
1883
are
totally
silent
in
citizenship.
they
are
specific
though
about
a
merely
of
other
employment
criteria.
they
authorized
the
president
to
ascertain
fitness
as
to
age,
health,
character,
knowledge,
ability
for
employment
sought.
the
specificity
with
regard
to
these
five
criteria
i
would
submit
indicate
that
other
criteria
were
not
intended
and
given
the
fact
that
the
whole
operation
the
civil
service
of
program
is
to
best
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
civil
service.
it
can
best
be
promoted
by
a
larger
pool
of
employees
not
a
smaller
pool.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
none
of
the
regulation
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
unfortunately,
my
clients
are
not
of
status
of
mr.
von
braun
and
my
clients
fall
under
the
competitive
civil
service.
the
federal
government
has
chosen
when
none
competitive
civil
service.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
thank
you.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
remarks
ended
concerning
our
arguments
that
the
regulation
is
not
authorized
by
the
congress
or
the
president
and
that
the
regulation
also
conflicts
with
two
executive
orders.
i
feel
that
our
presentation
of
the
brief
adequately
covers
that.
i'd
like
to
conclude
my
remark
that
under
the
constitution
of
united
states,
the
congress
has
many
alternatives,
many
paths
it
can
take.
it
can
as
suggested
by
this
court's
decision
in
sugarman,
issue
regulation,
statutes
which
say
that
particular
positions
because
of
issues
of
sensitivity,
because
of
issues
of
national
security,
because
they
involved
the
formulation,
the
execution,
the
review
of
broad
public
policy
may
only
rest
with
citizens.
likewise,
as
we
suggested
this
morning,
congress
if
it
chooses
and
it
has
not
so
chosen
yet,
can
impose
certain
conditions
on
those
who
enter,
those
who
are
not
yet
achieved
that
status
of
lawful
resident
alien;
those
who
have
still
not
touched
upon
the
soil
of
the
country.
the
point
is
that
congress
has
not
chosen
to
do
that.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
importance
that
attaches
when
a
person
becomes
a
lawful
resident
alien
that
is
enter
this
country
as
a
resident
alien
to
be
here
on
a
permanent
basis.
that
is
when
the
person's
rights
under
the
constitution
as
a
person
come
into
effect.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
no,
i'm
suggesting
that
once
he
is
here,
the
condition
will
not
be
imposed.
if
that
is
impose
as
a
condition
of
its
entry
into
united
states
that
is
entirely
a
different
matter.
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that
has
not
been
and
though
it
is
not
and
as
i
have
suggested
that
congress
has
only
in
two
different
areas
imposed
conditions
on
those
who
entered
united
states.
this
is
not
this
case
here.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
government
obviously
can
potentially
if
that
is
one
of
the
grounds
for
deportation.
the
government
has
chosen
first
not
to
use
--
impose
the
condition
or
second
or
the
government
has
not
utilized
deportation
for
violation
of
certain
types
of
laws.
but
the
government
always
have
the
powers
of
deportation
subject
to
of
course
constitutional
constraints
that
are
placed
on
that.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
clearly,
my
clients
wouldn't
be
because
there
are
resident
aliens
but
possibly
future
immigrants
to
this
country
might
have
conditions
post
now.
let
me
--
my
point
is
that
for
purposes
of
argument
in
this
case
i
will
concede
that
congress
has
it.
as
an
attorney
of
that
case
came
before
me,
i
would
like
to
be
back
before
this
court
(voice
overlap)
point.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
say
that,
but
i'm
trying
to
say
that
at
this
point
congress
the
vehicle
that
congress
chose
and
has
chosen
now
a
blanket
regulation
that
only
deals
with
resident
aliens
is
not
a
proper
vehicle
under
the
constitution.
in
graham,
this
court
said,
“the
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
authorize
the
individual
states
to
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.”
what
i'm
suggesting
in
this
case
is
that
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
to
authorize
itself
to
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
whatever
tests
this
court
employs
the
compelling
interest
test
a
rational
relation
etcetera.
the
congress
has
violated
the
constitution.
should
congress
choose
other
vehicles
and
i
hope
that
congress
would
take
the
lead
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggested
in
sugarman
that
possibly
identified
those
types
of
positions
were
maybe
we
wished
to
have
citizen
formulation
and
execution
review
that
brought
public
policy
that
congress
take
the
lead
of
a
postal
service
where
the
postal
service
has
identified
its
certain
sensitive
positions
still
must
be
held
only
by
citizens.
but
that
for
the
broad
mass
of
people
such
as
the
jobs
that
my
clients
are
seeking,
unfortunately
not
seeking
a
job
sought
by
in
mr.
van
braun
that
citizenship
is
clearly
not
relevant
for
that.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
today,
as
it
has
done
in
the
past,
is
trying
to
paint
this
case
for
what
it
is
not.
the
government
is
trying
to
paint
this
case
as
one
involving
plenary
power
of
congress.
this
case
does
not
although,
as
we
shall
argue
later,
if
it
does,
the
government’s
actions
are
not
immune
from
constitutional
strictures.
the
plenary
power
of
congress
stands
over
this
area,
which
we
are
discussing,
stems
from
the
constitution,
article
1
section
8
clause
4.
the
only
words
in
the
constitution
are
naturalization.
congress
has
power
over
naturalization.
this
court,
in
cases
as
recent
as
sugarman
and
griffiths,
has
interpreted
that
to
mean
congress
has
plenary
power
over
immigration
and
naturalization
and,
as
it
is
pointed
out
today,
immigration
connotes
entry
to
this
country,
deportation,
and
naturalization.
issues
where
national
security,
foreign
affairs,
and
this
country’s
sovereignty
are
inevitably
intertwined,
that
is
not
involved
today.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
naturally,
i
already
have
the
language
requirement
to
be
a
citizen,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
congress
is
dealing
in
areas
as
naturalization
and
emphasize
to
congress,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
says,
we
do
not
have
even
a
statue
today
really
dealing
with
aliens.
but
if
congress
was
acting
in
regard
to
naturalization
that
would
be
a
clear
indication
that
it
was
exercised
its
plenary
power
and
in
that
area,
this
court’s
role
is
not
eliminated
but
the
test
is
quite
different.
i
think
the
court
then
gives
far
greater
deference.
the
notion
that
somehow
this
case
is
going
to
lead
to
this
court
automatically
striking
down
200
statutes
is
just
not
correct.
first
of
all,
many
of
those
statutes
involve
appointed
officials
and
i
think
that
aliens
may
have
difficulty
raised
in
standing.
many
of
those
statutes
only
involve
a
mere
few
people
and
not
the
millions
involved
here.
most
importantly,
many
of
those
statutes
involved
issues
of
national
affairs,
security,
the
sovereignty
of
this
country,
and
regardless
of
what
test
this
court
utilizes,
whether
this
court
talks
about
the
status
of
aliens,
suspect
class,
whether
this
court
talks
about
conditions
not
being
rationally
related,
whether
this
court
talks
about
presumptions
being
irrebuttable
or
not.
the
fact
is
this
government
surely
has
the
right
in
certain
circumstances,
clear
precise
tailored
circumstances,
not
to
allow
aliens
to
do
certain
things.
the
problem
in
this
case,
of
course,
as
the
problem
in
other
cases
this
court
has
dealt
with,
is
the
total
blanket
exclusion,
and
one
of
the
interesting
points,
which
your
honor
mentioned,
is
that
the
government
has
explicitly
in
other
areas
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
example,
your
honors,
in
the
statute.
it
is
noted
at
page
84
and
72
of
the
government’s
brief,
the
government
in
areas
involving
the
essence
of
national
security,
the
atomic
energy
commission,
the
department
of
defense,
nasa,
highest
officials
in
the
executive
branch,
has,
by
statute,
allowed
aliens
to
work
in
those
departments.
again,
in
example
of
tailoring,
what
i
do
want
to
emphasize
is
that
this
case
does
not
involve
immigration
and
does
not
involve
plenary
power.
what
it
involves
is
a
blanket
exclusion
against
individuals
who
have
been
lawfully
admitted
and,
if
i
may
quote
to
this
court
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1970,
“once
an
alien
lawfully
enters
and
resides
in
this
country,
he
becomes
invested
with
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
to
all
people
within
our
borders.”
these
rights
are
not
alienable
and
guard
against
any
encroachment
by
either
federal
or
state
authority.
the
decision
is
hellenic
lines
versus
rhoditis.
it
appears
at
page
39
of
our
brief.
one
of
the
problems
that
i
have
with
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
is
that
he
concedes
to
this
court
that
a
certain
particular
rights
in
the
constitution
apply
to
resident
aliens.
he
conceded
today
that
the
first
amendment
applies,
that
due
process
applies.
as
mr.
justice
marshall
asked,
then
why
does
not
equal
protection
apply?
why
is
the
government
allowed
to
be
selective?
the
fact
that
equal
protection
may
involve
inherent
classification
is
not
an
answer.
consider
a
hypothetical
of
congress
saying
that
aliens
do
not
have
first
amendment
rights.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
a
classification
between
aliens
and
citizens,
but,
as
the
solicitor
general
conceded
today,
under
the
court’s
decision
resident
aliens
clearly
have
first
amendment
rights.
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
in
this
case,
the
facts
that
what
these
people
were
seeking.
and,
by
the
way,
your
honor,
i
did
not
know
last
year
that
one
of
my
clients
had
become
a
citizen
and
i
was
aware
that
another
had,
but
it
is
very
clear
from
this
court’s
decisions
that
one
does
not
have
to
be
a
citizen
to
take
advantage
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
griffiths
case
recognized
that
the
person
in
that
case
chose
not
to
exercise
the
right
to
be
a
citizen.
in
sugarman
versus
dougall,
two
of
the
four
named
appellees
had
been
here
long
enough
to
qualify.
in
graham
versus
richardson,
mrs.
graham
had
been
here
much
longer
than
the
requisite
period
of
time
to
become
a
citizen.
this
court
did
not
require
the
individuals
there
to
exercise
that
option;
this
court
should
not
require
it
here.
what
my
clients
were
seeking
was
to
work
as
a
janitor,
a
file
clerk,
loading
and
unloading
mail
at
the
post
office,
and
as
an
evaluator
of
educational
programs.
one
of
the
ironies
of
course
is
that
three
of
them
at
one
time
worked
for
the
federal
government,
two
in
the
california
state
program
which
paid
their
salaries,
one
respondent
louie,
who
inadvertently
got
a
job
at
the
post
office.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
point
the
irony
because
they
actually
got
it
wrong,
if
you
will,
the
regulation
involved
here,
although
they
did
not
get
around
to
it
totally
and
then
they
worked
outstandingly
according
to
the
appendix,
the
evaluation
of
their
supervisors,
and
yet,
because
of
this
blanket
exclusion
in
the
regulation
not
the
statute,
they
had
to
leave
federal
employment.
and
i
think
also
it
should
be
noted
that
the
exclusion
in
the
federal
regulation
says
that
to
work
for
the
federal
government
you
must
be
a
citizen
or
owe
permanent
allegiance.
unfortunately,
the
federal
government
has
taken
the
position,
which
i
have
never
seen
justified,
that
owing
permanent
allegiance
means
only
individuals
from
american
samoa.
i
point
you
to
the
government’s
brief,
page
81,
note
67.
i
do
not
know
why
owing
permanent
allegiance
cannot
be
extended
to
others.
for
example,
three
of
my
four
named
plaintiffs,
at
the
time
this
case
had
been
brought,
filed
declarations
of
intent
to
become
a
citizen.
it
is
too
bad
that
they
had
to
wait
five
years
to
exercise
their
option
to
become
citizens
before
they
became
open
to
federal
employment.
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
this
court
is
that,
given
the
nature
of
the
jobs
that
they
sought
not
involving
natural
security,
given
that
they
had
performed
outstandingly,
there
is
no
justification
to
exclude
them.
clearly,
the
court
below
relied
on
compelling
interest.
we,
as
mr.
justice
powell
indicated
in
the
griffiths
case,
we
are
not
concerned
with
labels,
whether
this
court
calls
it
overriding
interest,
an
important
interest,
compelling
interest,
whether
this
court
uses
the
rational
relationship
test,
whether
this
court
uses
irrebuttable
presumption,
because
clearly
this
regulation
creates
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
we
are
concerned
with
the
fact
that
aliens,
solely
because
of
their
status,
are
excluded
from
federal
employment.
mr.
bork
said
that
in
regard
to
federal
government
aliens
are
not
a
suspect
classification.
i
submit
that
they
strongly
are.
this
court
has
said
continually
that
aliens
are
inherently
suspect;
they
are
an
example
of
a
discreet
and
insular
minority
for
whom
such
heightened
judicial
solicitude
is
appropriate
from
graham
and
sugarman.
they
are
inherently
suspect
even
if
it
is
the
federal
government.
they
are
examples
of
discreet
and
insular
minorities
even
to
the
federal
government.
the
fact
that
the
disability
is
not
one
that
is
long,
the
fact
that
these
appellees
can
become
citizens
is
not
relevant.
it
was
not
relevant
to
this
court
in
graham;
it
was
not
relevant
in
sugarman;
it
was
not
relevant
in
griffiths.
the
point
is
that
the
suspect
classification
remains
the
same.
what
is
different
in
this
case
is
the
interest
which
the
government
can
assert.
that
is
why
the
lower
court
did
not
say
that
sugarman
and
graham
were
dispositive.
it
found
them
helpful
but
not
squarely
controlling.
what
one
must
do
is
analyze
the
interests
that
are
involved.
as
we
submit,
the
government
must
be
required
to
show
the
strongest
possible
interest,
but
even
if
you
do
not
require
that,
even
if
you
use
the
traditional
rational
relationship
test,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
rationales
offered
by
the
government
are
very,
very
weak.
for
example,
the
government
says
that
one
of
the
rationales
is
that
we
want
to
induce
aliens
to
become
citizens.
well,
first
of
all,
there
are
numerous
statutes
which
allow
non-citizens
to
work
for
the
federal
government
including
the
most
sensitive
positions.
clearly,
those
are
not
inducive
to
become
citizens.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
totally
agree,
but,
of
course,
there
are
no
facts
in
this
case
that
show
it
was
in
congress’
mind.
since
the
statute
is
silent,
i
do
not
know
if
we
can
say
that
was
in
congress’
mind
but
there
are
no
facts
to
say
what
was
on
the
mind
of
the
civil
service
commission
that
the
reason
for
the
regulation
was
to
induce
citizenship.
obviously,
one
of
the
ways
this
court
could
have
answered
that
in
sugarman
versus
dougall
was
to
say
that
the
states
by
having
requirements
that
to
work
with
the
state
civil
service,
you
must
be
a
citizen
would
be
enhancing
the
congressional
role
in
inducing
citizenship.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
agree
that
there
is
a
difference,
but
as
this
court
stated
last
term,
if
i
may
quote
directly
from
weinberger
v.
wiesenfeld
at
95
supreme
court
1228
note
2,
“this
court’s
approach
to
the
fifth
amendment
equal
protection
claims
has
always
been
precisely
the
same
as
to
equal
protection
claims
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.”
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
no,
it
is
involved
in
the
federal
government.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
think
that
aliens
in
a
different
category
in
regard
to
what
interest
the
government
is
allowed
to
assert.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
in
regard
to
federal
government.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
you
were
talking
about
issues
of
entry,
naturalization,
deportation,
then
i
do
not
disagree
with
you
of
course.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
right
and
we
are
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
there
are,
clearly,
differences.
citizens,
of
course,
are
not
subject
to
requirements
of
entry.
citizens
are
not
subject
to
naturalization
or
deportation.
any
congressional
law
would
say
that
“because
you
are
a
citizen,
you
cannot
hold
a
federal
job”
would
be
struck
down
automatically.
what
we
are
suggesting
here
is
that
when
the
federal
government
is
dealing
with
resident
aliens,
it
has
many
powers,
but
its
powers
must
be
tested
by
the
principles
of
this
court
and
whether
those
principles
require
strong
compelling
interest,
rational
relationships,
presumptions
that
are
not
irrebuttable,
aliens
are
deserving
the
protections
carved
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
totally
agree
with
you,
your
honor
that
aliens
are
and
have
been
treated
differently
than
citizens.
one
of
the
things
that
we
are
not
going
to
do
in
this
case
if
we
prevail
is
to
wipe
out
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
aliens.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
do
not
think
it
could
take
out
the
flaws
but
it
would
purely
aid
our
understanding
of
what
congress
is
doing.
i
would
not
concede
your
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
right.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
still
emphasize
that
the
proper
test
would
not
be
rational
relationship,
but
if
that
test
were
applied,
then
i
think
that
some
of
the
reasons
articulated
by
your
honor
would
not
be
sufficient.
for
example,
wanting
to
keep
federal
jobs
only
for
citizens,
that
smacks
up
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
which
this
court
has
consistently
struck
down
the
last
10
years.
wanting
to
induce
people
to
become
citizens,
i
would
think
that
that
might
be
partly
closer
to
the
process
of
naturalization,
and
if
that
would
be
deemed
by
this
court
to
be
congress
exercising
its
power
of
naturalization,
then
i
would
concede
in
that
situation
plenary
power
applies
and
this
court
would
probably
give
a
far
greater
deference
to
congress’
decision.
unfortunately,
we
have
no
reasons
offered
in
this
case.
we
have
no
reasons
that
would
at
all
justify
even
under
the
court’s
minimal
test
excluding
millions
of
resident
aliens
solely
because
of
their
status
from
seeking
all
types
of
federal
jobs.
the
congress
has
immutable
reasons
that
it
could
offer
why
aliens
should
not
hold
certain
types
of
employment,
issues
of
national
security
or
issues
of
foreign
affairs.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
sugarman,
government
has
the
right
to
require
citizenship
to
vote,
to
hold
elective
office,
to
hold
important
offices,
to
hold
offices
where
policy
making
and
executive
making
decisions
are
made.
those
rights
would
continue
after
this
case.
to
the
extent
that
congress
exercises
its
rights,
it
will
make
sure
that
certain
jobs
only
go
to
citizens.
my
clients
are
dealing
unfortunately
with
the
blanket
umbrella.
they
cannot
even
show
that
they
are
competent;
they
cannot
even
show
that
they
make
a
good
mail
clerk
or
a
good
janitor.
they
are
foreclosed
at
the
door.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
again,
it
has
not
been
stated
here
and
under
a
stricter
test
in
rational
relationship
would
not
be
valid.
under
the
rational
relationship
test,
i
would
argue
clearly
that
congress,
when
it
is
touching
upon
issues
of
naturalization
inducements
to
be
a
citizen,
has
far
greater
rights
and
can
assert
interest
which
this
court
should
give
greater
deference
to.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
the
congress
articulating
that
rationale,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
so
many
other
statutes,
there
are
so
many
areas
where
congress
does
not
have
that
similar
inducement,
and
i
would
like
for
the
congress
to
explain
to
this
court
what
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
it
would
be
a
sufficient
reason
if
congress
could
explain,
at
least
to
me
your
honor,
quite
possibly
not
to
yourself,
why
it
is
rationally
related
to
induce
citizenship
for
civil
service
positions,
but
not
for
all
of
the
other
positions
where
citizenship
is
not
required.
if
you
are
hypothetical
suggest
that
congress
have
given
that
reason,
i
think
i
have
a
much
weaker
case.
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
the
conventional
analysis,
your
honor,
if
the
cases
would
be
looked
up,
did
not
involve
the
situation
here
where
we
have
important
governmental
interests
that
are
being
curtailed
whether
or
not
we
use
the
notion
of
suspect
classification
and
rational
relation.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
for
the
same
reason
the
court
indicated
in
the
rodriguez
case
what
the
indicia
are
of
a
suspect
classification,
individuals
who
have
suffered
long
disabilities,
who
had
a
history
of
unequal
treatment,
who
have
been
in
a
position
of
political
powerlessness.
in
the
griffiths
case,
mr.
justice
powell
outlined
some
of
the
hostile
treatment
that
resident
aliens
have
suffered
in
this
country.
i
think
these
were
the
reasons
that
led
this
court
in
the
graham
case
and
in
sugarman
to
hold
that,
like
other
suspect
classifications,
aliens
are
needful
of
the
heightened
judicial
solicitude.
i
think
that
one
of
the
reasons
court
says
aliens
cannot
vote,
and
they
are
politically
powerless.
i
am
not
saying
that
alien
should
have
the
right
to
vote.
i
think,
clearly,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
and
i
think
under
the
constitution
that
congress
and
the
states
have
foreclosed
aliens
from
voting.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
that
interpretation
is
correct.
we
are
not
seeking
voting;
we
are
not
seeking
things
that
relate
to
the
country’s
sovereignty.
we
are
seeking
jobs
in
federal
civil
service
and
to
the
extent
that
issues
of
the
national
sovereignty,
issues
of
loyalty
and
security
are
precedent
of
a
federal
job,
then
we
willingly
concede
that
aliens
should
not
be
in
those
positions.
the
problem
is
that,
now,
we
can
then
make
no
determination.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
have
two
responses,
one
legal
and
one
factual.
i
think,
legally,
this
court
has
said
that
descriptions
like
that
of
favoring
citizens
over
non-citizens
is
the
type
of
special
public
interest
doctrine
which
this
court
went
out
of
its
way
in
graham
and
sugarman
to
repudiate.
i
think
factually,
your
honor,
we
have
filed
amicus
briefs
that
show
that
the
unemployment
rate
among
resident
aliens,
unfortunately,
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area,
is
three
to
four
times
that
of
citizens
and
although,
clearly,
if
a
resident
alien
gets
a
job,
you
replace
a
citizen.
i
think
the
amice
shows
that
it
is
far
easier
for
citizens,
at
least
where
i
come
from,
to
get
employment
than
resident
aliens.
but
again,
congress
has
not
said
this
and,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
recognized,
congress
has
not
even
discussed
aliens.
i
do
not
wish
at
this
time
to
repeat
what
is
in
my
brief
concerning
our
non-constitutional
arguments.
i
think
it
is
very
clear.
i
think
that
the
executive
order
10577,
just
as
mr.
justice
stevens,
mentioned
citizenship,
but
what
the
president
requires
the
civil
service
commission
to
do
is
establish
criteria
with
relation
to
citizenship.
i
submit
that
if
the
president
thought
that
the
criteria
was
going
to
be
blanket
exclusion
of
all
non-citizens
that
would
have
been
a
rather
vain
and
idle
gesture.
unfortunately,
the
civil
service
commission
has
not
established
any
criteria.
what
they
have
done
is
issued
a
blanket
order.
one
other
response
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
we
are
faced
clearly
with
a
policy
that
it
has
been
in
existence
a
long
time,
although
i
clearly
submit
to
you
that
there
is
no
statutory
authorization.
i
would
hope
that
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
area
of
constitutional
law,
the
fact
that
a
policy
has
existed
for
a
long
time,
does
not
immunize
it
from
constitutional
protections.
likewise,
the
fact
that
the
civil
service
commission
has,
for
many
decades,
foreclosed
aliens
from
federal
employment
should
not
immunize
it
from
the
test
that
this
court
has
laid
down
in
relation
to
the
explicit
specific
authorization
that
congress
must
give
in
executive
or
administrative
body
when
dealing
with
an
important
interest
such
as
at
stake
here.
again,
i
hope
that
my
brief
is
adequate
in
that
point.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
answer
to
your
first
part,
no,
it
is
not
an
action
of
sovereignty
and
the
reason
that
i
would
is
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
attribute,
and
the
reason
i
would
is
that
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
the
plenary
power
deals
with
matters
of
entry,
naturalization,
and
deportation.
as
the
quotation
i
read
in
the
1970
case
of
hellenic
versus
rhoditis
to
state
it,
“once
the
alien
is
lawfully
in
this
country,
absent
naturalization
issues,
absent
issues
of
deportation,
the
alien
does
get
full
and
complete
treatment
of
the
constitution.”
but,
your
honor,
if
you
are
correct,
if
it
was
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
then
my
position
is
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
if
your
hypothetical
is
correct,
excuse
me,
that
it
was
an
attribution
of
sovereignty,
then
i
would
submit
that
the
fact
that
congress’
plenary
powers
are
involved
does
not
mean
that
this
court
gives
an
absolute
okay
to
what
is
going
on.
this
court
still
has
a
role
to
play.
our
brief
annunciates
the
numerous
cases
using
the
war
powers
where
this
court
has
said
“the
talismanic
incantation
of
a
plenary
power
cannot
immunize
the
congress’
action
under
the
constitution.”
clearly,
though,
if
the
plenary
power
is
present,
i
would
concede
that
the
court’s
test
is
more
deferential,
but,
as
i
stated
here,
i
do
not
believe
the
plenary
power
is
present.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
only
justification
or
reason
that
really
exists
for
the
total
exclusion
of
resident
aliens
from
all
federal
employment
is
that
they
are
aliens.
to
state
that
would
confess
discrimination.
hence,
the
petitioners
are
silent.
i
submit
that
such
silence
can
no
longer
immunize
the
constitutional
violations.
as
this
court
has
said
in
graham
versus
richardson
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
authorize
individual
estates
to
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
would
submit
that
when
congress
is
not
acting
in
areas
of
deportation,
naturalization,
and
immigration
congress
itself
cannot
authorize
its
own
violation
of
the
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
have
a
couple
of
answers.
first
of
all,
this
congress
has
clearly
never
stated
that,
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
just
because
it
is
not
in
title
8
of
the
united
states
code.
secondly,
the
fact
that
it
may
be
related
to
naturalization
does
not
explain
then
why
everything
else
is
not
related
to
naturalization,
for
example,
a
resident
alien
exercising
his
first
amendment
rights.
we
want
to
encourage
resident
aliens
to
become
citizens.
hence,
we
deny
them
for
five
years
first
amendment
rights.
this
court
would
not
accept
such
an
argument.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
think
that
outside
of
the
area
of
deportation,
naturalization,
and
immigration
where
it
clearly
relates
to
that
plenary
power,
the
reason
that
is
obvious,
your
honor,
i
think
is
that
because
the
constitution
does
treat
resident
aliens
under
the
fifth
amendment
protections,
that
we
would
not
tolerate
saying
that
resident
aliens
does
not
have
first
amendment
rights.
that
is
why
i
say
we
should
not
tolerate
that
a
resident
alien
does
not
have
equal
protection
rights.
what
is
different,
vis-à-vis
the
citizen,
is
that
the
governmental
interest
and
the
way
those
interests
are
balanced
will
be
quite
different
for
the
resident
alien
than
they
are
for
citizens.
thank
you
very
much.
