mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
respondents
are
four
aliens
who
have
been
denied
employment
in
the
federal
competitive
civil
service
by
a
reason
of
the
commissions
--
civil
service
commission's
regulation
requiring
that
applicants
from
most
positions
be
either
citizens
of
united
states
or
persons
owing
it
allegiance.
respondents
filed
the
class
action
challenging
the
regulation
on
constitutional
on
other
grounds.
the
district
court
on
the
government's
motion
dismissed
the
action
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
regulation
violates
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
said
that
alienage
is
a
suspect
to
classification
so
that
the
compelling
governmental
interest
must
be
shown
they
justified
treating
aliens
differently
than
citizens
with
respect
to
federal
employment.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
we
believed
mistakenly
on
the
rational
of
this
court's
decisions
in
sugarman
versus
dougall
and
graham
against
richardson.
those
cases
concerned
of
course
state
restrictions
on
the
eligibility
of
the
aliens
for
state
employment
and
state
welfare
benefits.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
civil
service
commission's
regulation
is
a
valid
exercise
in
the
national
power
and
i
reached
that
result
in
alternative
ways.
my
first
submission
is
that
the
equal
protection
principle
has
no
application
to
the
federal
governments
dealing
with
aliens
as
aliens.
it
has
application
of
course
to
the
other
capacities.
i
wish
to
be
quite
clear
about
this.
the
equal
protection
principle
applies
to
persons
who
are
aliens
and
it
protects
them
from
a
variety
of
inequalities
such
as
inequalities
imposed
on
the
grounds
of
their
race
or
religion.
but
the
equal
protection
principle
does
not
apply
we
think
to
a
pure
alienage
classification
such
as
that
before
us.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
when
it
is
valid.
everything
i
am
talking
about
now
is
in
the
federal
context
and
i
am
at
some
pains
to
point
out
what
apparently
has
not
been
fully
understood
by
respondents
that
we
are
not
saying
that
the
equal
protection
principle
does
not
apply
against
the
federal
government
to
a
person
who
is
an
alien
and
of
course
it
does.
we're
only
saying
it
does
not
apply
to
in
his
capacity
as
alien.
it
may
apply
to
his
capacity
whether
it's
race
or
religion
or
sex
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
or
age
or
some
any
other
way
in
which
the
equal
protection
principle
applies
and
of
course
other
constitutional
protection
supply
to
aliens.
so,
we're
not
contending
any
such
to
make
any
broad
claim.
the
reason
we
think
that
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
can
apply
it's
because
of
the
plenary
powers
of
the
national
sovereign
with
respect
to
alienage.
our
constitution
does
not
forbid
alienage
classifications.
on
the
contrary,
the
constitution
requires
the
federal
government
though
not
the
states
to
employ
alienage
classifications.
now,
my
alternative
submission
will
be
that
at
most
the
equal
protection
clause
principle
has
a
very
attenuated
application
to
distinctions
between
citizens
and
aliens
when
those
distinctions
are
made
by
the
federal
government.
to
employ
the
compelling
governmental
interest
standard
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
i
think
effectively
to
destroy
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
aliens
contained
in
the
constitution
or
much
of
it
and
certainly
to
destroy
much
of
the
great
mass
of
legislation
which
distinguishes
between
citizens
and
aliens.
some
indication
of
that
massive
legislation
is
contained
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
for
the
federal
government,
alienage
cannot
be
a
suspect
classification
because
the
constitution
gives
the
federal
government
the
power
and
indeed
the
duty
to
make
that
classification
and
to
legislate
with
respect
to
it.
and
that's
a
power
to
duty
of
course
the
states
do
not
have.
this
necessarily
means,
i
think
that
if
the
equal
protection
principle
has
any
application
here
and
i
think
it
does
not.
it
is
satisfied
by
meeting
the
rational
basis
test
and
i
will
argue
later
that
the
challenge
regulation
here
clearly
meets
the
rational
basis
test.
but
first
i
want
to
argue
that
we
ought
not
to
apply
the
equal
protection
test
at
all
in
this
case.
we
have
here
an
exercise
by
the
civil
service
commission
of
the
delegated
combined
powers
of
the
congress
and
the
president.
and
those
powers
of
course
relate
to
a
naturalization
foreign
policy
national
defense,
treaty
making
and
so
forth.
and
in
fact,
what
has
been
exercised
here
it
seems
to
me
a
power
inherent
in
the
idea
of
the
sovereignty
of
a
nation
state,
the
power
to
distinguish
between
those
who
owe
it
allegiance
and
those
who
do
not.
and
so
obviously
is
this
power
to
differentiate
between
those
who
owe
allegiance
and
those
who
do
not
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
that
the
practice
and
question
here
is
followed
by
every
nation
in
the
world.
and
so
obviously
as
this
is
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
that
it
is
been
exercised
and
gone
on
contested
for
more
than
90
years
which
fact
i
think
give
to
this
regulation
all
the
support.
the
long
continued
and
universally
accepted
usage
can
confer.
this
factor
seemed
to
me
to
make
this
case
completely
different
from
sugarman
versus
dougall
and
graham
against
richardson.
the
states
are
not
independent
sovereigns;
they
have
no
power
to
regulate
naturalization,
no
power
to
conduct
foreign
of
affairs,
and
decide
what's
required
by
national
defense.
no
power
to
make
treaties.
nothing
in
the
constitution
gives
them
a
right
explicitly
granted
to
the
federal
government
of
treating
alienage
as
a
proper
classification
for
legislation.
if
alienage
is
a
suspect
classification
for
state
law,
it
is
constitutionally
made
a
proper
and
indeed
inevitable
classification
for
federal
law.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
not
mr.
justice
marshall
because
that
would
be
if
congress
passed
a
law
in
giving
the
states
the
power
what
they
wished
to
do
with
respect
to
aliens
that
would
not
be
a
federal
policy
with
respect
to
aliens.
that
would
be
simply
turning
over
to
state
policy
a
subject
that
does
not
belong
to
state
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
there
are
many
limitations
mr.
justice
marshall
over
the
congress'
power
over
aliens
not
only
may
it
not
turn
the
power
over
to
the
states
but
must
exercise
itself
as
a
national
power
but
obviously
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
that
they
could
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
that
they
could.
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
whereas
my
point
the
equal
protection
principle
does
apply
to
all
persons.
and
therefore,
it
applies
to
persons
who
also
happened
to
be
aliens.
i
am
not
contesting
that
and
if
an
alien
is
discriminated
against
the
grounds
of
its
race
or
sex
or
age
then
he
will
be
treated
by
the
equal
protection
principle
just
as
a
citizen
would
be.
i'm
merely
suggesting,
arguing
that
the
alienage
classification
is
not
one
to
which
the
equal
protection
principle
applies.
that
is
when
congress
legislates
as
to
all
aliens
equal
protection
does
not
apply
when
it
legislates
as
to
aliens
who
are
women
it
does
apply.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
can,
mr.
justice
marshall.
indeed,
we
have
a
variety
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
haven't
thought
of
it
that
way
and
i
don't
believe
your
honor
that
i'm
dividing
it
by
employment
as
against
something
else.
i
haven't
thought
of
that
way
and
of
course
much
of
the
legislation
about
aliens
is
not
legislation
about
employment
it's
by
a
variety
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
that
was
a
state
regulation
upon
employment.
i
think
we've
never
had
a
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
the
language
was
used
before
that
mr.
justice
marshall
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
always
known
from
the
inception
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
race
was
the
primary
suspect
classification
in
our
constitution.
and
i
don't
know
but
when
the
rhetoric
of
suspect
classification
began,
i
do
not
know.
and
when
that
particular
formulation
of
the
problem
began,
i
do
not
know.
but
i
think
that
the
distinction
between
the
state
and
the
federal
is
shown
by
it
when
you
look
the
--
when
you
move
from
state
law
to
federal
law
you
also
move
from
cases
like
sugarman
and
graham
to
cases
like
harisiades
against
shaughnessy,
kleindienst
against
mandel
and
so
forth;
cases
that
uphold
the
most
severe
kinds
of
restrictions
upon
aliens.
and
from
the
early
cases
on
we
have
known
and
this
court
said
that
congress
has
power
in
this
field
and
in
fact
it
has
as
much
or
more
power
in
this
field
that
it
has
in
other
legislative
fields.
there's
no
place
for
congress'
power
is
more
complete
than
in
this
one.
now,
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
i'm
fully
aware
of
course
that
the
power
of
congress
is
at
its
strongest
when
it's
choosing
to
exclude
or
class
of
immigrants
or
to
deport.
but
i
think
that
decision
to
admit
or
exclude
is
necessarily
intertwined
with
decisions
about
alien's
rights
and
obligations
here.
for
one
thing,
this
case
could
be
recast
if
congress
so
desired.
i
would
suppose
to
say
that
a
condition
of
entry
in
the
united
states
is
not
apply
for
federal
employment
until
you
have
been
naturalized
and
if
we
would
then
have
the
same
thing.
in
fact,
i'm
not
sure
that
for
that
reason
this
regulation
doesn't
have
all
the
force
that
law
would
have.
for
another
thing,
decisions
about
how
many
to
admit
under
what
terms
and
so
forth
and
the
standard
for
naturalization
are
necessarily
influenced
by
congress
ability
to
control
the
package
of
rights
and
obligations
that
the
alien
has
while
here.
and
again,
we
see
that
in
the
constitution
itself
indeed
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
gives
birth
to
the
equal
protection
principle
in
our
constitutional
jurisprudence,
there
is
a
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens
which
is
a
distinction
made
as
to
aliens
and
citizens
in
this
country
not
for
purposes
of
immigration.
and
i
will
leave
the
discussion
of
that
distinction
to
our
brief
and
merely
point
out
that
congress
has
adjusted
this
package
of
rights
and
obligations
that
aliens
and
citizens
have
again
and
again
throughout
our
history.
and
i
think
that
now
to
begin
to
apply
for
the
first
time,
the
equal
protection
principle
in
the
way
that
the
respondents
asked
would
severely
hamper
congress'
power,
destroy
it
in
many
respects.
and
it
would
be
a
major
constitutional
innovation
without
any
warrant
in
the
constitutional
text,
in
its
history
or
indeed
in
policy.
there
is
for
that
reason
i
think
only
one
fully
satisfactory
formulation
of
the
law
with
respect
to
resident
aliens.
and
i
would
say
is
this
and
i
think
i've
said
it
before
but
i
will
stress
it
as
i
leave
the
point.
the
equal
protection
principle
applies
to
persons
who
also
are
aliens
but
it
does
not
apply
to
them
in
their
status
as
alien.”
in
any
other
status,
they
occupy
the
equal
protection
principle
may
apply
to
them
which
is
to
say
that
congress
may
not
impose
burdens
upon
resident
aliens
because
they're
white
or
black
or
yellow
or
because
of
their
religion
but
it
may
differentiate
between
aliens
and
citizens.
congress
may
not
deprive
aliens
of
specific
rights
guaranteed
elsewhere
in
the
constitution
we're
not
arguing
that
it
may.
it
obviously
may
not
prison
an
alien
without
due
process,
may
not
subject
them
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
so
forth.
but
the
one
principle
which
is
manifestly
inappropriate
when
alien
--
when
the
government
--
the
federal
government
addresses
alienage
as
a
subject
is
equal
protection
because
inherent
the
constitution,
inherent
the
idea
of
nationhood
is
a
fundamental
inequality
between
citizens
and
aliens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
would
think
that
would
be
one
of
the
last
rights
that
could
be
opened
to
aliens
mr.
chief
justice.
that
certainly
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
denied
indeed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
it
is
up
to
the
states
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
have
been
place
where
aliens
have
been
allowed
to
vote
and
i
think
it
might
be
a
delicate
constitutional
question
which
i
hope
i
need
not
embark
on
here
whether
the
federal
government
would
have
in
that
circumstance
if
the
qualifications
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
power
to
overrule.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
think
i
would
reserve
that
as
a
possibility
but
there's
no
bearing
i
think
upon
our
present
inquiry.
and
i
think
this
is
the
logical
answer
to
our
case
but
should
this
court
determine
that
the
equal
protection
principle
is
applicable.
i
continue
nonetheless
to
believe
that
this
commission
regulation
is
valid.
under
the
current
doctrinal
formulation,
the
equal
protection
applies
with
one
of
two
degrees
of
severity.
the
federal
power
i've
just
sketched
means
i
think
that
the
strict
scrutiny
mode
of
analysis
or
the
test
of
compelling
governmental
interest
is
plainly
inappropriate
to
this
subject
matter.
to
apply
them
is
to
effectively
destroy
congress'
and
the
presidents'
undoubted
powers
in
this
field.
and
it
is
destroy
i
think
very
nearly
destroy
without
any
warrant
the
distinction
between
citizen
and
alien.
in
this
context,
the
federal
power
at
least,
it
seems
to
me
appropriate
to
note
that
alienage
is
not
by
any
means
a
permanent
or
a
mutable
characteristic
like
race
or
sex.
the
disability
imposed
by
this
commission
regulation
is
both
temporary
and
it
is
quite
limited.
naturalization
and
the
privileges
of
citizenship
are
available
in
five
years
to
an
alien
and
then
three,
if
the
alien
marries
a
citizen.
now,
each
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
has
now
have
been
here
not
when
they
started
the
case
but
now
not
been
here
long
enough
to
qualify
for
citizenship
so
far
as
i
know
the
date
none
of
them
is
applied.
one
respondent
have
been
here
for
28
years
and
has
not
troubled
to
apply
for
a
citizenship
and
i
fail
to
see
why
in
cases
like
that
benefit
should
be
obtained
through
a
lawsuit
rather
than
to
a
proclamation
of
allegiance.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
griffiths
case
of
course
was
again
state
restriction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
would
think
if
there
is
any
place
in
our
policy
and
in
our
law
where
we
are
entitled
to
say
a
benefit
is
available
if
you
choose
to
proclaim
allegiance
but
it
is
not
available
otherwise
it
would
be
precisely
in
the
area
of
federal
employment.
for
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
does
not,
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know,
i
don't
think
they're
that
many
of
them
but
perhaps
they
have.
i
do
not
know.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
good
reason
why
this
regulation
does
not
distinguish
between
aliens
who
intend
to
become
citizens
and
aliens
who
do
not
intend
to
do
so
and
why
it
covers
both
classes
of
aliens.
and
i
think
i
will
briefly
try
to
explain,
try
to
point
to
some
of
the
factors
that
lead
me
to
think
that
this
regulation
if
it
must
pass
a
rational
relationship
test
passes
it
with
high
mark.
and
i
will
cite
a
few
things
this
regulation
does
which
seem
to
me
valuable
and
which
congress
and
the
president
might
rationally
think
to
be
viable.
at
the
first
place,
it
offers
an
inducement
for
resident
aliens
to
acquire
knowledge
of
this
country,
to
acquire
the
language,
to
proclaim
allegiance,
and
to
become
citizens.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
quite
legitimate
for
congress
to
wish
to
induce
aliens
living
here
to
immigrate
themselves
into
our
national
life
and
into
our
political
community
in
this
process
of
becoming
citizens.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
in
fact
a
rather
obvious
exercise
of
the
power
to
make
rules
to
respect
the
naturalization.
two,
it
does
avoid
a
rather
large
and
complex
of
administrative
burden
that
will
be
entailed
by
a
system
in
which
all
federal
jobs
were
classified
according
to
whether
or
not
they
entail
any
aspect
of
a
formulation
or
execution
of
policy.
and
then
we
had
the
tag
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
the
result
on
the
state
side
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
think
it
need
not
to
be
result
in
the
federal
side
because
as
i
have
said
because
of
the
very
strong
federal
power
that
exist
in
this
area.
and
if
we
come
to
our
rational
relation
test
rather
than
a
compelling
governmental
interest
test
which
was
applied
in
sugarman,
then
i
think
this
reason
becomes
important.
it
may
not
have
been
enough
against
the
compelling
governmental
interest
test.
i
think
it
is
if
i'm
correct
that
utmost,
the
rational
relationship
test
applies
here.
because
the
federal
government
which
has
many,
many
employees
means
would
have
to
tag
i
suppose
aliens
so
that
they
were
not
by
accident
or
inadvertence
moot
to
sensitive
facilities
or
into
post
that
might
properly
be
reserved
for
citizens
if
we
had
to
meet
this
administrative
burden.
and
i
suppose
it
will
be
a
great
deal
of
litigation
about
that.
and
third,
the
federal
payroll
i
think
it's
proper
to
note
has
become
an
important
means
for
implementing
solutions
to
economic
and
social
problems.
minority
groups
for
one
example
have
been
benefited
by
federal
act
--
affirmative
action
hiring
that
helps
to
counterbalance
some
discrimination
in
the
private
sector.
and
i
think
it
might
be
irrational
for
congress
to
wish
to
maximize
the
effectiveness
of
the
federal
payroll
in
this
function
by
confining
to
it
citizens.
so
i
offer
three
reasons
so
others
could
be
adduced.
the
inducement
to
apply
for
citizenship
and
to
integrate
one's
self
from
the
national
life
and
indeed
in
the
political
community
of
this
nation.
the
administrative
burden
and
the
use
of
the
federal
payroll
as
a
social
implement.
none
of
these
objectives
is
impermissible
or
evil.
each
of
them
bears
a
rational
relation
to
the
regulation
promulgated
by
the
commission
which
means
i
think
that
the
regulation
does
not
offend
the
equal
protection
principle.
so,
i
come
back
at
the
end
to
where
it
began.
the
compelling
governmental
interest
test
can
hardly
be
used
with
respect
to
federal
legislation
or
federal
regulation
that
is
where
the
federal
government
has
so
much
power.
if
the
equal
protection
principle
apply
i
think
have
satisfied
here
if
it
does
not
apply
clearly,
the
regulation
is
valid
and
we
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i'm
not
sure
about
veterans
in
general
of
course
--
i
think,
yes
they
do.
they
do,
i
can't
give
you
the
details
of
mr.
justice
powell.
in
addition
to
that
of
course,
an
alien
who
serves
has
his
ability
to
become
a
citizen
accelerated.
and
there
is
i
believe
a
veteran's
preference
but
i
can't
give
you
the
details
of
how
would
operates.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
blackmun,
years
of
predicting
the
sky
falling
and
never
falls
in
has
lead
to
believe
that
very
few
things
turn
out
to
be
unqualified
disasters.
i
think
i
can
speak
for
myself
and
for
the
government
attorney,
mrs.
shapiro,
follows
me
in
saying
that
infinitely
preferable.
if
both
of
these
cases
been
cited
as
we
asked.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondents
are
four
aliens
who
have
been
denied
employment
in
the
federal
competitive
civil
service
by
a
reason
of
the
civil
service
commission’s
regulation
requiring
that
applicants,
for
most
positions,
be
either
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
persons
owing
the
united
states
allegiance.
respondents
filed
a
class
action
challenging
this
regulation
unconstitutional
on
other
grounds.
the
district
court,
on
the
government’s
motion,
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim;
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
regulation
violates
the
equal
protection
principle
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
said
that
alienage
is
a
suspect
classification
so
that
the
compelling
governmental
interest
must
be
shown.
the
court
of
appeal
relied
as
we
believe
mistakenly
on
the
cases
of
this
court
in
graham
against
richardson
and
sugarman
against
dougall.
those
cases
concern
state
restrictions
on
the
eligibility
of
aliens
for
state
employment
and
state
welfare
benefits.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
civil
service
commission’s
regulation
is
a
valid
exercise
of
a
national
power,
and
i
reach
that
result
in
alternative
ways.
my
first
submission
is
that
the
equal
protection
principle
has
no
application
to
the
federal
government’s
dealings
with
aliens
as
aliens.
i
want
to
be
quite
clear
about
that.
the
equal
protection
principle
obviously
applies
to
persons,
which
includes
of
course
aliens
and
it
protects
them
from
a
variety
of
inequalities.
for
example,
inequalities
on
account
of
race,
inequalities
on
account
of
religion,
but
my
submission
is
that
the
equal
protection
principle
does
not
apply
to
a
pure
alienage
classification.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
might
be
the
case.
he
certainly
would
--
the
congress
could
not
bar
--
congress
could
make
substantive
rules
but
congress
could
not
deprive
the
alien
of
due
process
of
law,
trial,
and
so
forth.
i
think
that
congress
may
make
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
effect,
i
think
some
of
the
things
and
many
of
the
statutes
from
the
books
are
offenses
only
for
aliens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
have
a
little
difficulty
imagining
the
situation
in
which
those
are
not
made
offenses
also
for
citizens
but
they
certainly
--
the
argument
i
am
making,
which
i
think
would
take
into
its
logical
extreme
would
lead
to
that
result.
i
think
one
need
not
practice
and
anticipate
that
particular
result.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
contention
is
that
the
aliens
have
the
explicit
guarantees
of
the
constitution,
for
example,
congress
could
not
provide
ex
post
facto
punishment
for
an
alien
who
would
rob
the
bank.
congress
could
not
deprive
of
an
alien
of
due
process
of
law.
congress
could
not
deprive
the
alien
of
his
first
amendment
right
to
speak
or
to
worship.
congress
may
do
none
of
those
things
and
congress
may
not
treat
an
alien
differently
from
other
person
on
the
grounds
that
he
is
black
or
white
or
yellow
or
a
female,
but
i
think
congress
has
plenary
power
with
respect
to
alienage.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
precisely,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
whereas
the
states
in
the
cases
that
we
dealt
with
in
sugarman
against
dougall
and
graham
against
richardson
and
in
re
griffiths
and
so
forth,
have
no
power
given
to
them
by
the
federal
constitution
over
aliens
as
a
class.
the
federal
government
has
plenary
power,
extraordinary
power,
over
alienage
and
aliens
as
a
class,
not
only
the
power
coming
from
article
1
section
8
clause
4
which
gives
explicit
power
to
legislate
with
respect
to
immigration
and
naturalization,
but
indeed
the
inherent
powers
arising
out
of
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
policy,
the
power
of
national
defense,
and
so
forth.
and,
indeed,
the
constitution
itself,
in
many
places,
article
4,
confines
privileges
and
immunities
to
citizens,
so
that,
for
purposes
of
federal
legislation,
alienage
is
not
only
a
suspect
classification,
it
is
an
inevitable
classification.
the
federal
government
had
not
only
the
power
but
the
duty
to
legislate
with
respect
to
aliens
as
a
class.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
my
alternative
submission
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
internally
inconsistent
to
say
it
to
this
extent.
the
respondents’
claim
here,
and
i
think
the
only
way
respondents
can
prevail,
is
that
alienage
is
a
suspect
classification,
which
i
think
is
quite
wrong
in
this
context,
and
therefore
we
must
show
the
most
compelling
governmental
need
to
classify
with
respect
to
alienage.
if
that
were
true,
i
do
not
see
how
any
federal
legislation
with
respect
to
alienage
is
going
to
survive.
i
do
not
know
of
a
statute
off
hand
that
has
ever
survived
this
great
judicial
scrutiny
test.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so,
mr.
justice
stewart.
so
that
if
we
say
that
a
compelling
governmental
interest
must
be
shown,
i
doubt
it
will
ever
be
shown
with
respect
to
any
of
these
statutes
that
we
have
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
and
our
supplemental
brief
in
the
appendix
over
200
provisions
in
the
federal
code
which
classify,
one
way
or
another,
by
alienage.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
pardon
me.
i
wanted
to
say
that
that
does
not
even
deal
with
title
8
which
is
the
main
codification
of
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
aliens.
pardon,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
no
doubt,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
legislation
would
be
well
within
congress’
power.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
is
true
also,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
certainly
had
the
deportation
cases
which
were
much
more
severe
than
that
in
which
persons
who
had
joined
the
communist
party,
at
a
time
when
it
was
not
illegal
to
do
so,
were
subsequently
deported
because
of
an
after
enacted
statute,
so
that
i
have
no
doubt.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
are
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
are
dealing
with
regulation
taken
under
the
civil
service
act
of
1883
and
congress
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
statute
itself
is
silent.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
is
not
silent,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
believe
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
stevens.
in
the
second
part
of
our
main
brief,
it
is
quite
clear
not
only
the
congress
in
enacting
the
civil
service
statute
and
its
various
amendments
later,
it
is
also
quite
clear
that
president
arthur
required
in
his
order
citizenship
and
that
president
theodore
roosevelt
extended
the
category
for
not
only
citizens
but
to
persons
who
owe
allegiance.
so
that
two
presidents
dealt
with
this
citizenship
requirement
in
a
knowing
way.
now
i
think
in
so
far
as
we
are
talking
about
a
deliberate
policy,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
legislative
history
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
the
two
presidents,
and
the
executive
order
10577,
which
is
also
in
our
brief,
refers
to
citizenship.
so,
i
think
this
is
about
as
deliberate
a
policy
as
one
could
seek.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
course,
the
post
office
does
now
does
hire
aliens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
in
this
case,
if
the
regulation
were
repealed
i
would
think,
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
part
of
the
federal
civil
service
that
the
repeal
of
the
regulation
and
the
failure
to
exclude
citizens
would
be
in
contravention
of
the
executive
order
and
in
contravention
of
the
intent
of
congress.
now,
i
do
not
know,
i
suppose
it
is
also
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
there
is
no
doubt,
mr.
justice
stevens
that
if
all
of
those
expressions
of
policy
are
made
silent
that
the
local
branch
of
government
certainly
could.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
would
prefer
not
to
use
the
word
“discrimination”.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
federal
government’s
power
to
do
this,
to
classify
it
this
way,
is
inherent
in
the
system.
the
federal
government
cannot
classify
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
so,
i
would
think
so,
i
would
think
so.
indeed,
there
are
sections
of
the
government
which
do
have
the
power
to
hire
aliens,
and
do
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
is
a
-
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
they
are
not
under
the
competitive
civil
service
now,
are
they,
the
post
office?
they
are
not,
and
i
think
there
are
statutory
exceptions
for
certain
places
like
the
defense
department
which,
by
nature
of
its
work,
may
wish
often
to
hire
aliens
and
may
wish
to
make
individualized
determinations
and
finds
it
worthwhile
to
expend
its
resources
it
is
making.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
not
particularly
aware
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
can
get
exceptions
made
with
the
circumstance,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
undoubtedly,
for
that
kind
of
work,
would
have
to
make
that
kind
of
exception
at
the
time
when
the
european
scientist
came
to
this
country.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do
not
think
the
reason
for
this
regulation
is
necessarily
the
sensitivity
of
the
work
involved.
that
is
one
reason.
one
thing
that
requiring
residents
in
this
country
for
five
years
does
is
to
give,
in
the
ordinary
case,
a
track
record
for
the
person
applying
and
a
way
of
checking
about
him
in
a
situation
where
you
probably
need
some
kind
of
talent.
somebody
has
not
been
there
five
years,
you
expend
the
resources
to
do
the
checking
or
take
your
chances,
and
that
seems
to
me
in
no
way
to
cast
doubt
upon
the
general
rule
of
the
federal
government
sees
fit
to
follow.
but
my
main
point
is
that
we
have
here
an
exercise
by
the
civil
service
commission
of
a
delegated
combined
power
of
congress
and
the
president,
and
those
are
powers
relating
to
naturalization
to
foreign
policy,
to
national
defense,
and
to
treaty
making.
in
fact,
i
think
what
has
been
exercised
is
a
power
that
is
inherent
without
even
respect
to
the
constitutional
provision
of
the
very
idea
of
a
nation
states
which
possesses
sovereignty.
every
nation
state
distinguishes
between
those
who
owe
allegiance
to
it
and
those
who
do
not,
and
so
obvious
is
that
that
i
think
every
nation
or
virtually
every
nation
in
the
world
makes
that
distinction.
and
i
think
so
obvious
is
it
that
it
has
been
exercised
and
gone
uncontested
for
over
90
years
in
this
country
in
this
explicit
form,
and
i
think
that
is
constitutionally
a
relevant
factor,
because
it
gives
this
practice
all
of
the
support
that
long
continued
in
the
university
accepted
usage
confers.
now
i
think
those
are
what
make
this
case
different
from
the
state
cases,
sugarman
and
graham.
respondents’
only
argument
in
this
connection
is
i
think
both
a
simplistic
and
a
mechanical
one,
and
that
argument
runs
as
follows:
whenever
an
equal
protection
principle
has
been
formulated
in
a
case
involving
a
state,
that
principle
must
automatically
be
applied
against
the
federal
government.
their
example
is
the
formulation
of
the
equal
protection
principle
in
brown
against
board
of
education
applied
against
the
federal
government
in
bolling
against
sharpe.
and
i
think
that
argument
is
patently
fallacious,
because
that
progression
from
state
to
federal
cannot
be
made
when
the
constitution
explicitly
gives
the
federal
government
the
power
and,
as
i
say,
the
duty
to
legislate
about
aliens.
states
are
not
independent
sovereigns.
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
naturalize.
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
affairs,
to
make
decisions
about
national
defense,
to
make
treaties,
and
they
have
none
of
the
powers
which
give
congress
power
over
aliens
and
over
alienage.
when
we
move
from
state
cases
like
sugarman
and
graham
against
richardson,
we
really
move
into
a
whole
new
framework
of
cases
like
the
chinese
exclusion
case,
cases
like
harisiades
against
shaughnessy,
kleindienst
against
mandel,
cases
that
show
an
extraordinary
degree
of
power
in
this
field.
i
think
it
is
incontestable
as
the
chief
justice’s
question
a
moment
ago
pointed
out
that
congress
has
the
power
to
exclude
aliens
in
this
country
all
together,
and
that
is
a
corollary
of
that
power.
it
can
attach
such
conditions
to
entry
as
it
sees
fit.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
does
indeed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
admit
to
say
also
earlier,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
aliens
could
not
be
deprived
of
the
explicit
protections
of
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
because
we
are
dealing
with
unconstitutional
conditions,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
are
dealing
with
explicit
guarantees
that
are
asked
to
be
given
up
by
the
alien.
here,
i
am
merely
suggesting
that
they
could
have
been
admitted
on
the
condition
that
they
not
apply
for
federal
employment
until
they
are
naturalized,
which
i
think
is
not
an
unconstitutional
condition.
and
my
claim
is
much
less
broad
than
it
may
have
seemed
when
i
began
that
line
of
development.
but,
for
example,
congress
now
excludes
aliens
from
entry
to
perform
certain
kinds
of
labor,
skilled
or
unskilled,
unless
they
get
a
certification
from
the
secretary
of
labor
that
they
are
not
taking
away
a
job
of
an
american
citizen,
and
if
an
alien
violates
that,
i
am
sure
he
may
be
deported.
that
is
the
kind
of
condition
i
am
talking
about
that
could
be
attached
to
the
shore
and,
therefore,
i
think
this
kind
of
condition
about
not
seeking
federal
employment
could
be
attached
at
the
shore,
but
that
is
not
essential
to
my
argument
because
in
any
case
the
federal
power
to
admit
or
to
exclude
or
to
deport
is
plenary,
and
is
necessarily
intertwined
with
decisions
about
the
alien’s
rights
and
obligations
while
he
is
in
this
country.
there
is
no
way
the
two
can
be
separated.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
mr.
justice
stewart,
again,
what
i
meant
by
the
fact
that
they
are
inevitably
intertwined,
i
think
it
is
right
and
i
think
it
is
right
not
because
of
a
legal
point
but
simply
because
congress’
decision
about
how
many
people
to
admit
will
necessarily
be
affected
by
the
power
they
have
over
aliens
here,
so
that
the
less
power
congress
has
to
classify
is
to
alienage
in
this
country.
that
may
affect,
indeed
in
some
cases
will
affect,
the
congress’
decision
about
time
for
naturalization,
degree
of
numbers
entering,
and
so
forth.
and
it
is
because
it
is
intertwined
i
think
that
historically
we
have
viewed
congress
as
having
such
power
over
aliens
in
this
country.
now,
congress
has
been
very
liberal
in
its
provisions
for
aliens
but
i
think
that
there
is
absolutely
no
constitutional
necessity
that
the
package
of
rights
and
obligations
that
they
provide
for
aliens
be
of
equal
value
to
the
package
possessed
by
citizens.
and
i
think,
to
begin
now
to
require
congress
or
to
take
away
from
congress
effectively
by
applying
this
compelling
governmental
interest
test
would
be
to
take
away
from
congress
almost
all
its
power
in
this
field,
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
constitutional
innovation
for
which
i
can
find
no
warrant
in
the
text
or
in
the
history
or
indeed
in
the
policy
of
the
constitution,
and
that
is
why
i
say
i
think
the
only
fully
satisfactory
formulation
of
the
law,
with
respect
to
resident
aliens,
is
that
it
protects
aliens
as
persons
but
not
in
their
status
as
aliens.
i
think
that
is
a
logical
answer
to
this
case,
but
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
--
if
this
court
disagrees
and
thinks
that
the
equal
protection
analysis
is,
in
some
degree,
relevant,
as
we
have
discussed,
there
are
of
course
two
degrees
of
severity
with
which
that
analysis
applies.
and
i
think
the
proper
test
here,
because
of
the
federal
power
in
this
field,
is
at
most
the
rational
basis
test,
anything
more
would
take
congress
almost
out
of
the
game.
i
think
in
the
context
of
a
federal
case
involving
a
federal
power,
it
is
appropriate
to
note
that
alienage
is
not,
like
race
or
sex,
an
immutable
characteristic.
the
disability
imposed
by
this
regulation
is
temporary
and
is
limited.
naturalization
and
the
privileges
of
citizenship
are
available
in
five
years
or
three
years
if
the
alien
marries
a
citizen.
now
in
fact,
the
other
appropriateness
of
calling
alienage
a
suspect
category
in
this
case
is
demonstrated
by
a
fact
to
which
i
have
been
informed
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
and
that
is
that
two
of
the
four
respondents
in
this
case,
two
of
the
four,
have
now
applied
for
and
received
citizenship.
all
four
of
them
are
eligible
the
last
time
this
case
was
argued.
in
fact,
mow
sun
wong,
the
lead
plaintiff,
i
am
informed,
was
naturalized
on
january
7,
1975
which
was
five
days
before
this
case
was
argued
last
term,
and
mr.
mok
was
naturalized
in
september
16,
1975.
now,
the
fact
that
they
can
choose,
all
of
them
can
choose
to
be
citizens,
and
two
of
the
respondents
have
acquired
citizenship
and
all
of
the
rights
that
go
with
it,
seems
to
me
to
illustrate
dramatically
how
unrealistic
it
is
to
speed
of
aliens
in
a
federal
context
as
a
suspect
classification
whose
rights
must
be
protected
because
they
are
persons
who
are
discriminated
against
--
as
persons
who
are
discriminated
against
on
grounds
of
race.
they
can
move
out
of
the
category
easily.
two
of
the
four
respondents
here
have.
i
trust,
if
the
other
remaining
two
do
become
citizens
before
this
case
is
decided,
counsel
of
respondents
will
tell
us,
will
tell
the
court
--
but
there
is
simply
no
reality
to
the
claim
of
suspect
classification.
now,
turning
to
the
rational
relation
test
just
very
briefly,
i
want
to
say
this.
if
this
regulation
must
pass
the
national
relation
test,
i
think
it
does
so
quite
easily,
and
i
will
mention
just
three
relationships
it
has
to
a
permissible
governmental
purpose.
in
the
first
place,
it
offers
an
inducement
for
resident
aliens
to
acquire
knowledge
of
this
country,
our
language,
something
of
our
government
to
proclaim
allegiance
and
to
become
citizens,
and
i
think
congress
may
legitimately
wish
to
induce
aliens
living
here
to
integrate
themselves
into
our
national
life
and
our
political
community
by
becoming
citizens.
one
of
the
respondents,
as
we
discussed
last
time,
has
now
been
here
for
over
29
years
and
has
not
troubled
to
apply
for
citizenship,
and
i
see
no
reason
why
congress
may
not
have
a
policy
to
induce
such
a
person
to
declare
that
integration
in
our
political
community
that
an
application
for
on
the
receipt
of
citizenship
implies
and
shows.
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
matter
to
be
taken
lightly.
it
is
a
force,
an
actual
force
and
a
symbolic
force
with
some
importance
making
for
the
cohesion
of
the
political
community
to
which
we
belong.
there
was,
i
think
last
time
we
discussed
this
case,
some
mention
of
xenophobia.
i
do
not
think
that
is
involved
here
at
all.
this
country
traditionally
and
today
is
more
hospitable
to
aliens
and
makes
naturalization
easier
than
most.
if
xenophobia
were
involved,
congress
would
simply
bar
all
aliens
from
our
shores.
this
legislative
and
presidential
purpose
alone,
i
think,
that
of
integrating
people
into
the
national
political
community
and
strengthening
the
cohesion
of
that
community
symbolically
and
actually
i
think
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
regulation.
but
if
i
were
to
make
another
point,
i
would
say
that
there
is
an
administrative
burden.
obviously,
aliens
may
be
kept
from
some
kinds
of
positions.
obviously,
aliens
may
be
kept
from
even
menial
positions
in
some
kinds
of
federal
facilities.
obviously,
it
is
more
difficult
to
check
an
alien’s
background
if
he
has
not
been
here
some
sufficient
period
of
time
to
establish
a
record
in
this
country,
i
take
that
the
government
is
entitled,
as
suggested
in
other
cases
recently,
to
make
a
broad
rule
to
take
care
of
administrative
difficulties
of
that
kind
and
not
have
to
follow
aliens
to
make
sure
they
are
not
transferred
to
the
wrong
place
to
keep
reclassifying
jobs
as
situation
changes.
and
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
federal
context
it
is
important
to
note
and
legitimate
to
note
that
the
federal
payroll
has
become
an
important
means
for
implementing
social
policies.
federal
affirmative
hiring
programs
that
helped
to
counterbalance
discrimination
of
the
private
sector,
and
i
think
congress
may
wish
to
maximize
the
effectiveness
of
the
federal
payroll
in
this
function
by
confining
it
to
citizens.
none
of
the
three
objectives
i
have
mentioned
is
impermissible;
none
of
them
i
think
is
able.
each
of
them
bares
a
rational
relation
to
the
regulation
of
the
commission,
which
means
the
regulation
does
not
offend
the
equal
protection
principle
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
just
a
scattering
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
reference
has
been
made
to
whether
or
not
congress
intended
this.
i
would
like
to
refer
you
to
our
main
--
the
court
to
our
main
brief,
page
71
and
following
pages.
it
must
be
quite
plain,
for
example,
footnote
63
on
page
78,
senator
holly
said,
when
he
was
heading
up
this
commission,
“it
would
be
among
the
duties
of
the
commission
to
devise
rules
for
conducting
examinations.
there
will
be
requirements.
anybody
can
think
of
a
few
in
a
moment.
the
applicant
must
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states”
and
on
and
on
in
other
quotes
from
congress.
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
intended
this
and
it
is
also
quite
clear
that
congress
need
not,
in
intending
such
a
classification,
make
a
statement
of
their
rational
purpose
which
is
satisfactory
to
respondents’
counsel.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
of
our
initial
brief,
your
honor,
it
is
page
78,
footnote
63.
i
just
cited
that
because
it
is
an
extraordinary
clear
statement
by
senator
holly
that
congress
assumed
citizenship
in
this
area
as,
indeed,
everybody
has.
on
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
statute
does
not
say
there
must
be
citizenship.
congress
assumed
apparently
that
anybody
carrying
that
out
would
naturally
require
citizenship
and
congress
has
been
aware
of
this
practice
over
the
years
and
in
legislative
enlightenment
and
in
the
public
works
statute,
public
works
act,
which
we
discuss
in
page
83
of
our
brief,
they
have
been
saying
that
salaries
may
not
be
paid
to
aliens
in
this
country
with
certain
exemptions
if
they
work
for
the
government.
so
that
this
is
the
congressional
policy;
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
as
well
as
a
presidential
policy,
which
is
why
i
said
the
policy
came
to
us
with
a
combined
weight
of
the
congress
and
the
presidents.
but,
on
the
question
of
the
suspect
classification,
pardon
me.
on
the
question
of
the
suspect
classification,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
johnson
against
robison
decided
in
1974
in
which
conscientious
objectors
who,
one
assumes,
will
always
have
the
record
of
a
conscientious
objectors
has
held,
conscientious
objectors
are
held
not
to
be
a
suspect
classification,
and
i
would
think
that
if
that
is
the
case
then
aliens
who
can
leave
the
category
certainly
do
not
qualify.
in
this
case,
essentially,
we
are
being
told
by
respondents’
counsel
that
they
do
not
like
any
imposition
of
obligations
upon
aliens
whichever
way
you
do
it,
because
we
are
told
that
this
statute
or
regulation
is
overbroad.
we
are
required
to
make
individualized
determinations,
and
the
weinberger
against
salfi
suggests
that
we
are
not
required
if
there
is
good
reason
not
to
require
us
to
expend
resources
to
make
individualized
determinations.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
held
against
us
by
respondents’
counsel
that
in
some
areas
of
government
the
government
finds
it
useful
to
make
individualized
determinations
and
to
hire
aliens,
so
that
we
are
attacked
both
over
breadth
and
under
breadth.
i
submit
that
this
is
a
traditional
power
and
clearly
a
constitutional
power
of
government.
there
is
no
inequity
involved
and
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
change
a
constitutional
power
in
practice
of
this
sort
for
these
reasons
at
this
time.
