justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
solicitor
general
has
congress
done
anything
with
respect
to
the
eligibility
of
aliens
for
federal
employment?
we
are
not
really
dealing
with
a
statute,
are
we,
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
itself
is
silent
with
respect
to
discrimination
involved,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
also
true
that
any
executive
order
is
also
silent
with
respect
to
the
particular
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
a
question
that
i
was
leading
up
to,
and
i
am
not
sure
it
is
appropriate,
but
i
have
it
in
mind.
supposing
the
paragraph
of
the
regulation
of
the
civil
service
agency,
whatever
its
appropriate
title
is,
requiring
citizenship
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
were
simply
repealed
so
there
was
nothing
in
words
that
required
that
an
applicant
for
employment
be
a
citizen
and
then
take
it
a
step
further
and
suppose
the
post
master
in
chicago
had
to
take
on
extra
help
with
the
christmas
work
or
something
like
that
and
he
put
into
effect
a
regulation
for
his
own
office
requiring
everyone
to
be
a
citizen.
would
you
contend
such
a
regulation
would
be
valid?
he
of
course
speaks
for
the
federal
government
within
his
own
office.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
they
do,
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
really
have
not
answered
the
question
i
mean
to
put.
i
am
not
--
suppose
the
statute
is
silent,
the
executive
order
is
silent,
and
the
top
regulation
is
silent
and
just
the
local
branch
of
the
federal
government
decides
for
itself
it
would
like
to
employ
citizens
only.
can
they
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
make
the
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
it
is
made
--
it
is
inherent
in
the
system,
it
is
inherent
in
the
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
includes
the
power
of
any
federal
officer
unless
explicitly
prohibited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
steinman,
may
i
interrupt
for
a
minute.
i
am
not
completely
clear
on
your
answer
to
the
solicitor
generalâ€™s
argument
that
the
incentive
to
become
a
citizen
is
a
rational
basis
for
a
rule
such
as
this.
i
am
not
sure
whether
you
are
saying
that
that
is
not
the
real
reason
and
we
do
not
know
what
the
real
reason
is
or
are
you
saying
even
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
that
is
why
the
regulation
is
adapted,
it
would
not
be
a
valid
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
are
you
saying
that
if
congress
had
articulated
this
as
its
real
reason,
it
would
be
a
sufficient
reason?
that
is
what
you
seem
to
be
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
they
did
assume
it
but
they
did
not
explicitly
require
it
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
second
case,
no.
73-1596,
the
matter
involves
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
a
civil
service
regulation,
which
excludes
all
persons,
except
american
citizens
and
natives
of
samoa,
from
employment
in
most
positions
in
the
federal
service.
in
a
suit
brought
by
five
aliens
who
had
been
denied
federal
employment
for
which
they
were
otherwise
qualified,
the
united
states
district
court
in
san
francisco
sustained
the
regulation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
the
regulation,
although
authorized
by
congress
and
the
president,
was
unconstitutional.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
question,
we
granted
certiorari.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
without
reaching
the
question
whether
congress
or
the
president
might
expressly
adopt
such
a
rule,
we
hold
that
the
regulation
deprives
a
large
and
already
disadvantaged
class
of
persons
of
an
interest
in
liberty
and
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
because
it
was
not
expressly
mandated
by
either
congress
or
the
president
and
was
not
adopted
by
an
agency
of
the
federal
government
having
any
responsibility
for
the
national
interest
which
are
asserted
in
justification
for
the
rule.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
filed
a
brief
concurring
statement.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
white,
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
