justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
the
approach
necessitates
striking
the
regulation
down
on
its
face
if
you
sought
certain
jobs?
let's
assume
you're
right.
why
would
the
regulation
be
invalid
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
were
construing
a
federal
regulation
here.
you
don't
strike
ordinarily
if
you
can
narrow
a
regulation
of
the
statute,
you
don't
strike
it
down
on
its
face
(voice
overlap)
you
don't
do
that
with
respect
of
state
statutes
or
regulations.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
true
that
there
are
many
aliens
working
for
the
federal
government
are
there
not
in
other
cases
in
nasa
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
we're
talking
about
the
civil
service
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
expand
on
your
comment
that
your
one
client
refused
for
her
own
religious
and
political
reasons.
tell
us
what
that
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
the
justice
is
really
asking
whether
the
choice
of
the
test
doesn't
dictate
the
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
the
government
--
that
congress
could
impose
conditions
on
entry
including
a
condition
that
you
would
(inaudible)
for
state
government?
i
take
it
do
you
suggest
that
just
hasn't
exercise
that
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
had
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
categorize
the
federal
power
to
exclude
or
to
deport
an
alien
if
he
commits
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
if
the
government
can
deport
a
person
for
committing
a
crime,
the
government
could
if
it
said
so
clearly
deporting
for
trying
to
work
for
the
government
or
for
working
for
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
clearly
big
difference
for
example
between
a
citizen
and
an
alien?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
this
case
really
involves
--
in
from
one
point
of
view
only
and
argue
and
over
whether
that
congress
has
exercise
powers
that
it
obviously
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
kind
of
employment
did
your
fourth
client
apply
for
the
one
who
is
the
citizen
of
the
world?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
need
to
make
--
to
get
that
clear.
does
a
condition
at
that
congress
might
impose?
does
it
end
when
they
finally
admit
him
to
the
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
then
that
if
you
admit
a
person
to
this
country
for
a
permanent
residence
or
even
for
temporary
residence
that
the
condition
--
you
cannot
impose
the
condition
that
while
he
is
here
he
not
work
for
the
federal
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
has
not
been
done
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
congress
could
make
it
a
criminal
offense
for
an
alien
to
rob
a
bank
but
only
a
criminal
if
he
is
an
alien.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
describe
and
create
and
define
the
offense
as
an
offense
only
if
committed
by
an
alien.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
could
do
that
with
bank
robbery
or
interstate
transportation
of
a
stolen
car
or
stealing
from
the
mail
or
any
of
the
normal
federal
offenses
with
which
we
are
familiar.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
that
is
the
thrust
of
your
--
