justice
potter
stewart
is
the
equal
protection
principle
of
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause,
in
other
words,
when
is
the
federal
government
that's
making
the
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
or
age?
justice
potter
stewart
that
language
--
that
not
only
language
but
that
those
thoughts
you
find
basically
in
immigration
and
deportation
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
up
to
states
pretty
much,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
have
to
involve
the
federal
government?
justice
potter
stewart
have
some
states
in
the
past
have
allowed
aliens
to
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
the
power
to
overrule
the
judgment
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
has
never
exercised
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
area?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
--
as
far
as
that
point
goes
the
court
wasn't
very
much
moved
by
that
argument
in
the
griffiths
case
was
it
where
it
was
pretty
clear
that
alien
did
cite
it.
she
didn't
ever
want
to
become
american
citizens
for
reasons
of
her
own?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
i'm
talking
about
the
arguments
you're
now
making.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
regulation
makes
no
distinction
between
aliens
who
were
long
time
aliens
and
aliens
who
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
hopeless
promptly
as
possible
to
become
citizens,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
i
don't
know
if
--
has
mrs.
griffiths
have
been
appointed
by
the
federal
court
under
the
criminal
justice
act?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
if
any
aliens
have?
any
alien
lawyers?
justice
potter
stewart
she
is
a
citizen
in
the
world
but
what
nation
in
fact
is
she
a
citizen?
justice
potter
stewart
where
was
she
born
china
--
mainland
china?
justice
potter
stewart
this
regulation
is
common
to
most
of
the
nations
in
the
world,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
your
point
is
that
they
don't
have
a
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
they
can
indulge
in
all
the
xenophobia
they
want
to?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
most
countries
are
not
federal
systems
when
such
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
it
was
under
constitutional
condition?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
internally
inconsistent
to
say
that.
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
way
of
announcing
the
conclusion
in
advance.
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
goes
to
even
further
than
the
argument
that
you
made
earlier
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
that
would
follow
that
aliens
could
be
excluded
on
the
ground
that
they
would
be
granted
none
of
the
rights
granted
to
other
people
in
our
country
by
the
bill
of
rights
of
the
constitution
and
above
that
condition.
justice
potter
stewart
but
could
they
be
admitted
on
the
condition
that
they
would
be
given
none
of
the
benefits?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not
if
your
argument
--
now
that
you
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
you
could
certainly
separate
them
by
simply
not
going
so
far
as
you
do
in
saying
that
congressâ€™
power
has
to
do
with
the
exclusion
and
deportation
of
aliens
and
not
with
all
these
other
things
you
have
talked
about,
and
not
with
what
it
is
involved
in
this
case
that
this
does
not
have
to
do
with
exclusion
or
deportation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
wholly
contrary
to
conventional
equal
protection
clause
analysis,
is
it
not?
we
do
not
require
the
given
reason
--
the
ordinary
approach
has
been
to
find
whether
or
not
any
conceivable
rational
reason
exists.
it
has
never
been
the
analysis
to
stick
congress
with
a
reason
they
gave
or
to
require
them
to
give
a
reason
or
anything
along
similar
lines,
conventional
equal
people
protection
clause
analysis.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
this
a
suspect
classification
when
it
is
a
classification
that
is
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
that
it
was
an
amendment
that
came
after
a
good
deal
of
the
national
trauma,
civil
war
and
proposal
on
adaption
of
that
amendment,
and
that
define
citizenship
in
the
united
states.
it
must
have
some
meaning
and
it
must
not
be
quite
as
invidious
and
suspect
and
irrational.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
fifteenth
amendment
virtually
says
so,
does
it
not?
