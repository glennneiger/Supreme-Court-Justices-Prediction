mr.
g.
ross
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
involves
a
disciplinary
sanction
imposed
against
three
10th
grade
female
public
school
students
for
violating
a
school
board
regulation
prohibiting
the
possession
or
use
of
intoxicating
beverages
at
school
or
at
a
school
sponsored
function.
the
petitioners
are
members
of
the
board
of
education
of
the
mena
special
school
district
of
polk
county,
arkansas.
petitioners
submit
that
the
basic
issue
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
reversed
directed
verdicts
for
the
school
board
defendants
in
a
public
school
student
suit
under
42
u.s.c.,
section
1983
on
the
grounds
that
the
school
board
had
misconstrued
and
misapplied
its
own
regulation
and
that
the
application
of
that
regulation
to
these
students
deprived
them
of
fourteenth
amendment
substantive
due
process.
petitioners'
contention
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
warrant
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
that
respondents
have
shown
the
deprivation
of
no
federally
protected
right.
for
reasons
which
i
hope
to
discuss
later,
we
submit
that
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process
is
not
properly
before
the
court
in
this
case
and
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
amicus
brief
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
deals
only
with
the
procedural
due
process
issue
and
does
not
reach
the
substantive
due
process
question.
the
basic
facts
are
uncontroverted.
early
on
the
school
day
on
february
7,
1972,
three
female
students,
two
of
them
are
respondents
here,
devised
a
plan
to
leave
the
school
premises
to
purchase
an
alcoholic
beverage
which
they
intended
to
put
into
the
refreshments
to
be
served
later
that
day
at
a
joint
parent-student
function
to
be
held
on
school
premises,
this
function
was
sponsored
by
the
home
economics
department.
since
the
school
district
is
situated
in
a
county
in
arkansas
which
has
exercised
its
local
option
and
has
loaded
“dry,”
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
the
county
is
unlawful.
the
respondents
drove
out
of
the
county,
across
the
state
line
into
the
state
of
oklahoma
where
they
purchased
at
a
tavern
a
quantity
of
malt
liquor
beverage.
returning
to
mena,
they
then
purchased
non-alcoholic
beverage
with
which
they
mixed
the
malt
liquor,
returned
to
school
and
completed
their
plan.
several
days
later,
their
teacher
learned
of
this
incident
and
confronted
the
girls
with
her
information.
after
first
denying
that
they
had
been
engaged
in
this
conduct,
they
later
admitted
their
involvement.
the
matter
was
then
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
principal
and
he
advised
them
that
he
would
invoke
a
one-week
suspension
until
such
time
as
the
board
of
education
had
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
question
and
that
it
was
their
ultimate
responsibility.
that
evening,
the
board
did
meet
to
consider
the
matter.
the
principal
and
the
teacher
who
had
visited
with
the
girls
earlier
that
week
relayed
to
the
board
the
information
that
was
given
to
him
by
the
students
and
the
board
voted
to
suspend
the
girls
for
the
balance
of
the
semester
pursuant
to
the
regulation
cited
in
our
briefs.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
this
occurred
on
february
7,
the
hearing
was
on
february
18.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
normally,
the
school
year
in
arkansas
school
districts
last
through
may,
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
observation
in
its
opinion
and
frankly
there
is
no
evidentiary
support
in
the
record
to
sustain
that.
they
had
completed
the
first
semester
of
that
school
year
and
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
they
lost
any
credit
other
than
that
which
they
would
have
earned
in
the
spring
semester,
namely
two
units.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
up
until
the
age
of
15,
your
honor
and
both
of
these
students,
one
was
16,
one
was
17.
so,
they
were
beyond
the
reach
of
the
compulsory
attendance
law.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
this
is
contrary
too
in
observation
of
the
district
judge
i
might
add.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
other
two
girls,
perhaps,
that
does
an
accurate
characterization.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
right
to
attend
the
public
schools
up
to
a
certain
age.
the
schools
may
furnish
instructions
for
students
between
the
ages
of
6
and
21.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
they
are
required
to.
but
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
the
school
district
has
to
furnish
courses
of
instruction
for
a
person
20
years
of
age,
for
example.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
correct.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
after
the
girls
and
the
parents
were
informed
of
the
decision
made
at
the
special
board
meeting,
they
were
later
furnished
at
the
request,
at
their
request
and
the
request
of
their
counsel,
a
special
board
meeting
to
be
held
on
march
2.
at
the
outset
of
this
meeting,
the
board
presented
a
statement
of
facts
which
they
had
found
and
on
which
they
had
based
the
suspension.
included
in
the
statement
was
the
following
which
appears
at
appendix
page
137
that
the
three
girls
in
question
traveled
to
oklahoma,
purchased
a
number
of
bottles
of
malt
liquor,
a
beer-type
beverage
and
later
went
on
to
school
premises
with
the
alcoholic
beverage
and
put
two
or
more
bottles
of
the
drink
into
the
punch
or
liquid
refreshment
which
was
to
be
served
to
members
of
the
class
and
their
parents.
the
respondents
and
their
counsel
were
then
given
an
opportunity
to
respond
which
they
did.
after
the
conclusion
of
this
presentation,
the
board
again
voted
that
the
children
would
be
suspended
for
the
balance
of
the
year.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
the
only
reference
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
the
district
judge
in
his
opinion
stated
that,
there
had
never
been
any
contention
by
the
students
or
their
parents
that
the
rule
had
not
in
fact
been
violated.
their
contention
was
the
punishment
was
excessive.
on
the
other
hand,
their
counsel
did
argue,
it
doesn't
appear
that
this
argument
was
presented
at
the
board
hearing
but
he
certainly
argued
at
trial
of
the
case
that
because
of
the
low
alcoholic
content
of
this
particular
beverage
which
evidence
demonstrated
later
to
be
3.2%,
that
there
was
actually
no
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
3.2%,
yes
sir.
that
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
in
solution
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
argument
was
that
there
had
been
no
proof,
if
there
it
wasn't
that
intoxicating
that
no
violation
of
the
rule
had
been
shown
and
that
this
constituted
a
violation
of
substantive
federal
constitutional
due
process
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
ultimately
based
their
opinion.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i'm
not
sure
that
i
am.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
that's
essentially
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
in
doing
so,
however,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
conveniently
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
school
board
construed
their
regulation
to
reach
alcoholic
beverages.
they
so
found
in
a
statement
issued
march
14.
the
girls
themselves
admitted
a
violation
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
at
the
trial
demonstrated
that
when
the
regulation
was
adopted,
it
was
adopted
in
response
to
an
incident
involving
beer
which
has
--
well,
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
what
the
beer
would
have
had
in
terms
of
alcoholic
content.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
alcohol
--
the
arkansas
statute's
definition
of
an
intoxicating
liquor
from
a
criminal
standpoint,
it
is
in
excess
of
3.2,
a
defined
beer
as
a
malt
beverage
containing
up
to
3.2%
alcohol.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
not
to
exceed.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
not
to
exceed
3.2.
yes,
sir,
this
particular
beverage.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
arkansas
statute,
it
is
not.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that.
i
don't
think
i
ever
drank
3.2
beer,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
it
is
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
when
inquired
--
when
the
board
president
inquired
of
him
as
to
the
nature
of
this
beverage,
he
said,
“in
his
view,
it
was
an
intoxicating
beverage.
its
possession
was
unlawful.
he
had
prosecuted
individuals
for
possessing
it
in
that
county.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
g.
ross
smith
it
was
mixed
with
the
non-alcoholic
beverage
off
of
the
school
premises.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
it
was
84
ounces
of
solution,
24
ounces
of
which
was
alcoholic
and
then
of
course
3.2%
of
that
was
the
alcohol.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
but
your
honor,
right,
that's
the
point.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
the
definition
provided
in
the
criminal
statutes
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
this
rule
was
adopted
by
the
school
board,
january
10,
1967.
the
board
president
through
the
board
members
who
were
on
the
board
at
that
time
testified
that
when
they
adopted
this
rule,
it
was
adopted
in
reference
to
an
incident
involving
beer
and
that
they
used
the
term
intoxicating
liquor
in
its
commonly
accepted
lay
sense.
they
had
no
reference
to
a
criminal
statutory
definition
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
intoxicating.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
the
point
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
the
point
we're
trying
to
make
is
that
this
board,
[laughter]
this
board
of
education
construed
the
conduct
of
these
youngsters
to
be
a
violation
of
its
regulation
and
they
imposed
a
punishment.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
they
had
a
remedy
provided
by
the
state
of
arkansas
by
their
state
courts.
since
1909
the
courts
of
arkansas
have
been
available
to
issue
writs
of
mandamus
for
wrongful
suspensions.
now,
we
submit,
there
is
no
federal
question
involved
in
this
somewhat
ludicrous
case.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
remanding
this
case
for
trial
on
the
plaintiff's
claim
for
damages
in
the
amount
of
$90,000.00
against
the
school
board
members
in
their
individual
capacities.
the
substance
of
our
argument
here
is
that
this
case
doesn't
belong
in
the
federal
courts.
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
liberty
or
property
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
which
would
require
or
authorize
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
board
made
an
error
in
applying
its
intoxicating
beverage
rule
to
these
facts.
there's
no
federally
protected
right
to
set
aside
an
erroneous
decision
made
by
a
state
officer,
be
it
a
school
district
or
anything
else
and
we
contend
that
this
is
the
dispositive
issue
in
the
case.
whether
we
agree
or
disagree
with
their
finding
that
a
violation
had
occurred
or
the
assessment
of
the
punishment,
it's
not
a
matter
that's
protected
or
involves
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
standard
by
which
the
jury
will
determine
whether
or
not
to
award
damages
against
these
board
members
in
their
individual
capacities.
its
good
faith
objectively
determined.
now
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
but
i
would
assumed
it
means
some
standard
calling
for
a
judgment
as
to
whether
they
acted
as
reasonably
prudent
school
board
members
would
have
acted
without
inquiring
into
their
actual
state
of
minds.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
this
court's
opinion
in
the
rhodes
case
coming
from
kent
state,
provides
the
very
minimum
standard
that
should
be
employed
and
there
the
reference
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
if
the
rhodes
--
if
the
rhodes
standard
of
conduct
is
objective
then
fine
because
it
does
require
an
actual
inquiry
into
what
the
man
was
thinking
at
the
time
he
did
it
and
whether
he
had
reasonable
cause
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
the
rhodes
case
states
that
the
immunity
depends
on
the
existence
of
reasonable
grounds
for
the
belief
formed
at
the
time
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
--
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
coupled
with
good
faith
belief.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that
affords
basis
for
immunity.
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
is
in
fact
the
manner
in
which
the
district
judge
instructed
the
jury.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
we
think
actually
that
there
are
grounds
for
an
absolute
immunity
here,
but
frankly
there's
very
little
authority
to
support
that
argument.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
well,
actually
your
honor,
the
district
judge
in
his
findings,
its
temporary
restraining
order
hearing
said,
“i
find
that
the
school
board
members
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
their
regulation
have
been
violated
at
the
time
they
took
their
initial
action
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
or
law,
the
damage
issue
should
never
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.”
mr.
g.
ross
smith
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
they
could
say
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
the
defense
of
good
faith
had
been
established
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
district
judge
had
before
him
a
good
deal
more
evidence
than
did
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
trial
transcript
to
the
trial
concerning
some
four
days,
it
was
not
included
in
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
at
this
time
and
we
submit
that
an
examination
of
that
would
be
illustrative
of
the
actual
good
faith
evidence
by
these
school
board
members.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
it
reviewed
evidence
which
had
been
compiled
at
the
temporary
restraining
order
here
along
with
answers
to
interrogatories
and
some
other
factual
material
that
was
in
the
case,
affidavits
submitted
in
connection
with
both
motions
on.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
it's
undefined
in
terms
of
whether
it
would
permit
someone
who
really
believed
they
were
doing
what
they
should
be
doing
to
be
found
to
be
in
good
faith.
as
i
read
their
opinion,
it
would
not.
it's
a
question
of
what
a
reasonably
prudent
person
would
have
been
doing
under
the
same
or
similar
circumstances.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes
sir.
as
long
as
we
don't
get
to
the
position
where
somebody
makes
a
wrong
decision,
a
decision
that's
safe
--
what
comes
to
mind
the
kirstein
case
where
the
issue
was
whether
the
college
officials
had
committed
a
constitutional
violation
by
excluding
women
from
what
had
previously
been
an
all-male
school.
they
did
exclude
women.
the
court
said,
there
was
no
reason
at
the
time
for
them
to
saying
this
was
unlawful
and
we
won't
assess
damages
against
them.
they
made
a
wrong
decision,
they
weren't
liable
for
it.
but
one
other
point
which
is
very
important
is
that
the
board
all
along
has
dealt
with
this
case
on
the
basis
of
admitted
facts.
there
has
never
been
any
controversy
as
to
a
factual
dispute
with
the
possible
exception
of
whether
or
not
this
mixture
was
intoxicating.
and
under
these
circumstances,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
the
court
to
reach
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
it's
able
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
right
and
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
in
august
1973.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
examine
the
question
of
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
federally
protected
right
here
to
establish
the
requisite
elements
of
1983.
we
submit
rodriguez
stands
for
the
proposition
that
unless
there
is
a
total
denial
and
we
don't
have
here
a
total
denial,
we
have
an
expulsion
or
a
suspension,
if
you
will,
for
a
portion
of
one
of
24
semesters
that
a
public
school
student
in
arkansas
will
be
attending
school.
efforts
were
made
here
to
assure
that
these
girls
would
graduate
with
their
class
by
taking
one
correspondences
course
and
one
additional
course
to
make
up
the
two
units
they
missed.
and
in
connection
with
the
previous
inquiry,
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
last
case
as
to
whether
there
is
a
property
interest
involved
even
the
district
court
decision
in
lopez
against
gomez
--
goss
--
lopez
against
goss,
i
believe
conceded
that
education
did
not
involved
a
property
interest.
in
epperson
against
arkansas,
this
court
said
that
discretion
that
is
to
be
accorded
to
public
school
officials
was
extremely
broad
and
this
court
should
intervene
only
in
a
clear
case
of
constitutional
violation
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
case
involves
no
such
clear
case
of
constitutional
violation.
if
the
court
please,
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
might
briefly,
address
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process.
as
has
been
noted,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
the
march
2,
1972
hearing
may
have
cured
any
prior
procedural
defect.
indeed,
the
students
and
their
counsel
were
granted
every
benefit
that
they
claim
in
their
brief.
they
had
notices
of
the
meeting.
they
had
a
statement
of
facts
upon
which
the
action
was
taken
at
the
inception
of
the
meeting.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
appear
to
present
any
witnesses
they
cared
to
present.
they
were
represented
by
a
counsel.
and
if
that
doesn't
constitute
procedural
due
process
in
the
public
school
context,
then
i
don't
know
what
does.
the
procedural
due
process
issue
will
not
sustain
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done.
i
would
assume
that
if
the
defect
is
found
in
the
procedures,
the
remedy
is
to
remand
the
case
and
give
them
a
new
hearing.
now,
what
on
earth
are
they
going
to
do
when
they
give
them
a
new
hearing?
what
kind
of
evidence
would
be
presented
at
that
point
that
already
has
been
presented?
the
point
is
that
the
school
board
construed
its
regulation
to
reach
alcoholic
beverages.
mrs.
gilford,
a
school
board
member,
testified
at
the
trial
that
when
the
rule
was
enacted,
there
was
no
discussion
of
a
legal
definition
of
intoxicating
liquor,
that
the
words
intoxicating
and
alcoholic
were
synonymous.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
that's
not
in
the
record.
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
the
question
if
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
with
their
class.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
graduated
this
past
spring.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
sir,
by
taking
a
correspondence
course
and
one
other
extra
course.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
would
assume
that
under
those
circumstances,
there's
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
--
distinct
possibility
that
the
students
would
pursue
their
damage
claim
against
the
individual
school
board
members,
since
they
have
had
at
least
take
up
two
extra
courses
at
that
point.
it
was
a
serious
punishment.
the
point
is
not
whether
any
of
the
federal
judiciary
agrees
with
whether
it
was
a
punishment
or
not.
the
point
is
whether
it's
a
decision
that
this
school
board
is
entitled
to
make.
the
board
is
in
a
county
in
which
the
citizens
of
the
county
have
made
a
decision
that
they
think,
possession
or
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
is
a
serious
matter.
and
we
submit
this
honorable
court
should
not
intervene
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
school
board.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
involves
a
disciplinary
sanction
imposed
against
three
10th
grade
female
public
school
students
for
violating
a
school
board
regulation
prohibiting
the
possession
or
use
of
intoxicating
beverages
at
school
or
at
a
school
sponsored
function.
the
petitioners
are
members
of
the
board
of
education
of
the
mena
special
school
district
of
polk
county,
arkansas.
petitioners
submit
that
the
basic
issue
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
reversed
directed
verdicts
for
the
school
board
defendants
in
a
public
school
student
suit
under
42
u.s.c.,
section
1983
on
the
grounds
that
the
school
board
had
misconstrued
and
misapplied
its
own
regulation
and
that
the
application
of
that
regulation
to
these
students
deprived
them
of
fourteenth
amendment
substantive
due
process.
petitioners'
contention
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
warrant
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
that
respondents
have
shown
the
deprivation
of
no
federally
protected
right.
for
reasons
which
i
hope
to
discuss
later,
we
submit
that
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process
is
not
properly
before
the
court
in
this
case
and
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
amicus
brief
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
deals
only
with
the
procedural
due
process
issue
and
does
not
reach
the
substantive
due
process
question.
the
basic
facts
are
uncontroverted.
early
on
the
school
day
on
february
7,
1972,
three
female
students,
two
of
them
are
respondents
here,
devised
a
plan
to
leave
the
school
premises
to
purchase
an
alcoholic
beverage
which
they
intended
to
put
into
the
refreshments
to
be
served
later
that
day
at
a
joint
parent-student
function
to
be
held
on
school
premises,
this
function
was
sponsored
by
the
home
economics
department.
since
the
school
district
is
situated
in
a
county
in
arkansas
which
has
exercised
its
local
option
and
has
loaded
“dry,”
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
the
county
is
unlawful.
the
respondents
drove
out
of
the
county,
across
the
state
line
into
the
state
of
oklahoma
where
they
purchased
at
a
tavern
a
quantity
of
malt
liquor
beverage.
returning
to
mena,
they
then
purchased
non-alcoholic
beverage
with
which
they
mixed
the
malt
liquor,
returned
to
school
and
completed
their
plan.
several
days
later,
their
teacher
learned
of
this
incident
and
confronted
the
girls
with
her
information.
after
first
denying
that
they
had
been
engaged
in
this
conduct,
they
later
admitted
their
involvement.
the
matter
was
then
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
principal
and
he
advised
them
that
he
would
invoke
a
one-week
suspension
until
such
time
as
the
board
of
education
had
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
question
and
that
it
was
their
ultimate
responsibility.
that
evening,
the
board
did
meet
to
consider
the
matter.
the
principal
and
the
teacher
who
had
visited
with
the
girls
earlier
that
week
relayed
to
the
board
the
information
that
was
given
to
him
by
the
students
and
the
board
voted
to
suspend
the
girls
for
the
balance
of
the
semester
pursuant
to
the
regulation
cited
in
our
briefs.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
this
occurred
on
february
7,
the
hearing
was
on
february
18.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
normally,
the
school
year
in
arkansas
school
districts
last
through
may,
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
observation
in
its
opinion
and
frankly
there
is
no
evidentiary
support
in
the
record
to
sustain
that.
they
had
completed
the
first
semester
of
that
school
year
and
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
they
lost
any
credit
other
than
that
which
they
would
have
earned
in
the
spring
semester,
namely
two
units.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
up
until
the
age
of
15,
your
honor
and
both
of
these
students,
one
was
16,
one
was
17.
so,
they
were
beyond
the
reach
of
the
compulsory
attendance
law.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
this
is
contrary
too
in
observation
of
the
district
judge
i
might
add.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
other
two
girls,
perhaps,
that
does
an
accurate
characterization.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
right
to
attend
the
public
schools
up
to
a
certain
age.
the
schools
may
furnish
instructions
for
students
between
the
ages
of
6
and
21.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
they
are
required
to.
but
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
the
school
district
has
to
furnish
courses
of
instruction
for
a
person
20
years
of
age,
for
example.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
correct.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
after
the
girls
and
the
parents
were
informed
of
the
decision
made
at
the
special
board
meeting,
they
were
later
furnished
at
the
request,
at
their
request
and
the
request
of
their
counsel,
a
special
board
meeting
to
be
held
on
march
2.
at
the
outset
of
this
meeting,
the
board
presented
a
statement
of
facts
which
they
had
found
and
on
which
they
had
based
the
suspension.
included
in
the
statement
was
the
following
which
appears
at
appendix
page
137
that
the
three
girls
in
question
traveled
to
oklahoma,
purchased
a
number
of
bottles
of
malt
liquor,
a
beer-type
beverage
and
later
went
on
to
school
premises
with
the
alcoholic
beverage
and
put
two
or
more
bottles
of
the
drink
into
the
punch
or
liquid
refreshment
which
was
to
be
served
to
members
of
the
class
and
their
parents.
the
respondents
and
their
counsel
were
then
given
an
opportunity
to
respond
which
they
did.
after
the
conclusion
of
this
presentation,
the
board
again
voted
that
the
children
would
be
suspended
for
the
balance
of
the
year.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
the
only
reference
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
the
district
judge
in
his
opinion
stated
that,
there
had
never
been
any
contention
by
the
students
or
their
parents
that
the
rule
had
not
in
fact
been
violated.
their
contention
was
the
punishment
was
excessive.
on
the
other
hand,
their
counsel
did
argue,
it
doesn't
appear
that
this
argument
was
presented
at
the
board
hearing
but
he
certainly
argued
at
trial
of
the
case
that
because
of
the
low
alcoholic
content
of
this
particular
beverage
which
evidence
demonstrated
later
to
be
3.2%,
that
there
was
actually
no
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
3.2%,
yes
sir.
that
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
in
solution
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
argument
was
that
there
had
been
no
proof,
if
there
it
wasn't
that
intoxicating
that
no
violation
of
the
rule
had
been
shown
and
that
this
constituted
a
violation
of
substantive
federal
constitutional
due
process
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
ultimately
based
their
opinion.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i'm
not
sure
that
i
am.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
that's
essentially
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
in
doing
so,
however,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
conveniently
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
school
board
construed
their
regulation
to
reach
alcoholic
beverages.
they
so
found
in
a
statement
issued
march
14.
the
girls
themselves
admitted
a
violation
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
at
the
trial
demonstrated
that
when
the
regulation
was
adopted,
it
was
adopted
in
response
to
an
incident
involving
beer
which
has
--
well,
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
what
the
beer
would
have
had
in
terms
of
alcoholic
content.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
alcohol
--
the
arkansas
statute's
definition
of
an
intoxicating
liquor
from
a
criminal
standpoint,
it
is
in
excess
of
3.2,
a
defined
beer
as
a
malt
beverage
containing
up
to
3.2%
alcohol.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
not
to
exceed.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
not
to
exceed
3.2.
yes,
sir,
this
particular
beverage.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
arkansas
statute,
it
is
not.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that.
i
don't
think
i
ever
drank
3.2
beer,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
it
is
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
when
inquired
--
when
the
board
president
inquired
of
him
as
to
the
nature
of
this
beverage,
he
said,
“in
his
view,
it
was
an
intoxicating
beverage.
its
possession
was
unlawful.
he
had
prosecuted
individuals
for
possessing
it
in
that
county.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
g.
ross
smith
it
was
mixed
with
the
non-alcoholic
beverage
off
of
the
school
premises.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
it
was
84
ounces
of
solution,
24
ounces
of
which
was
alcoholic
and
then
of
course
3.2%
of
that
was
the
alcohol.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
but
your
honor,
right,
that's
the
point.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
the
definition
provided
in
the
criminal
statutes
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
this
rule
was
adopted
by
the
school
board,
january
10,
1967.
the
board
president
through
the
board
members
who
were
on
the
board
at
that
time
testified
that
when
they
adopted
this
rule,
it
was
adopted
in
reference
to
an
incident
involving
beer
and
that
they
used
the
term
intoxicating
liquor
in
its
commonly
accepted
lay
sense.
they
had
no
reference
to
a
criminal
statutory
definition
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
intoxicating.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
the
point
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
the
point
we're
trying
to
make
is
that
this
board,
[laughter]
this
board
of
education
construed
the
conduct
of
these
youngsters
to
be
a
violation
of
its
regulation
and
they
imposed
a
punishment.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
they
had
a
remedy
provided
by
the
state
of
arkansas
by
their
state
courts.
since
1909
the
courts
of
arkansas
have
been
available
to
issue
writs
of
mandamus
for
wrongful
suspensions.
now,
we
submit,
there
is
no
federal
question
involved
in
this
somewhat
ludicrous
case.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
remanding
this
case
for
trial
on
the
plaintiff's
claim
for
damages
in
the
amount
of
$90,000.00
against
the
school
board
members
in
their
individual
capacities.
the
substance
of
our
argument
here
is
that
this
case
doesn't
belong
in
the
federal
courts.
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
liberty
or
property
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
which
would
require
or
authorize
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
board
made
an
error
in
applying
its
intoxicating
beverage
rule
to
these
facts.
there's
no
federally
protected
right
to
set
aside
an
erroneous
decision
made
by
a
state
officer,
be
it
a
school
district
or
anything
else
and
we
contend
that
this
is
the
dispositive
issue
in
the
case.
whether
we
agree
or
disagree
with
their
finding
that
a
violation
had
occurred
or
the
assessment
of
the
punishment,
it's
not
a
matter
that's
protected
or
involves
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
standard
by
which
the
jury
will
determine
whether
or
not
to
award
damages
against
these
board
members
in
their
individual
capacities.
its
good
faith
objectively
determined.
now
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
but
i
would
assumed
it
means
some
standard
calling
for
a
judgment
as
to
whether
they
acted
as
reasonably
prudent
school
board
members
would
have
acted
without
inquiring
into
their
actual
state
of
minds.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
this
court's
opinion
in
the
rhodes
case
coming
from
kent
state,
provides
the
very
minimum
standard
that
should
be
employed
and
there
the
reference
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
if
the
rhodes
--
if
the
rhodes
standard
of
conduct
is
objective
then
fine
because
it
does
require
an
actual
inquiry
into
what
the
man
was
thinking
at
the
time
he
did
it
and
whether
he
had
reasonable
cause
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
the
rhodes
case
states
that
the
immunity
depends
on
the
existence
of
reasonable
grounds
for
the
belief
formed
at
the
time
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
--
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
coupled
with
good
faith
belief.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that
affords
basis
for
immunity.
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
is
in
fact
the
manner
in
which
the
district
judge
instructed
the
jury.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
we
think
actually
that
there
are
grounds
for
an
absolute
immunity
here,
but
frankly
there's
very
little
authority
to
support
that
argument.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
well,
actually
your
honor,
the
district
judge
in
his
findings,
its
temporary
restraining
order
hearing
said,
“i
find
that
the
school
board
members
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
their
regulation
have
been
violated
at
the
time
they
took
their
initial
action
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
or
law,
the
damage
issue
should
never
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.”
mr.
g.
ross
smith
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
they
could
say
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
the
defense
of
good
faith
had
been
established
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
district
judge
had
before
him
a
good
deal
more
evidence
than
did
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
trial
transcript
to
the
trial
concerning
some
four
days,
it
was
not
included
in
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
at
this
time
and
we
submit
that
an
examination
of
that
would
be
illustrative
of
the
actual
good
faith
evidence
by
these
school
board
members.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
it
reviewed
evidence
which
had
been
compiled
at
the
temporary
restraining
order
here
along
with
answers
to
interrogatories
and
some
other
factual
material
that
was
in
the
case,
affidavits
submitted
in
connection
with
both
motions
on.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
it's
undefined
in
terms
of
whether
it
would
permit
someone
who
really
believed
they
were
doing
what
they
should
be
doing
to
be
found
to
be
in
good
faith.
as
i
read
their
opinion,
it
would
not.
it's
a
question
of
what
a
reasonably
prudent
person
would
have
been
doing
under
the
same
or
similar
circumstances.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes
sir.
as
long
as
we
don't
get
to
the
position
where
somebody
makes
a
wrong
decision,
a
decision
that's
safe
--
what
comes
to
mind
the
kirstein
case
where
the
issue
was
whether
the
college
officials
had
committed
a
constitutional
violation
by
excluding
women
from
what
had
previously
been
an
all-male
school.
they
did
exclude
women.
the
court
said,
there
was
no
reason
at
the
time
for
them
to
saying
this
was
unlawful
and
we
won't
assess
damages
against
them.
they
made
a
wrong
decision,
they
weren't
liable
for
it.
but
one
other
point
which
is
very
important
is
that
the
board
all
along
has
dealt
with
this
case
on
the
basis
of
admitted
facts.
there
has
never
been
any
controversy
as
to
a
factual
dispute
with
the
possible
exception
of
whether
or
not
this
mixture
was
intoxicating.
and
under
these
circumstances,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
the
court
to
reach
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
it's
able
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
right
and
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
in
august
1973.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
examine
the
question
of
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
federally
protected
right
here
to
establish
the
requisite
elements
of
1983.
we
submit
rodriguez
stands
for
the
proposition
that
unless
there
is
a
total
denial
and
we
don't
have
here
a
total
denial,
we
have
an
expulsion
or
a
suspension,
if
you
will,
for
a
portion
of
one
of
24
semesters
that
a
public
school
student
in
arkansas
will
be
attending
school.
efforts
were
made
here
to
assure
that
these
girls
would
graduate
with
their
class
by
taking
one
correspondences
course
and
one
additional
course
to
make
up
the
two
units
they
missed.
and
in
connection
with
the
previous
inquiry,
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
last
case
as
to
whether
there
is
a
property
interest
involved
even
the
district
court
decision
in
lopez
against
gomez
--
goss
--
lopez
against
goss,
i
believe
conceded
that
education
did
not
involved
a
property
interest.
in
epperson
against
arkansas,
this
court
said
that
discretion
that
is
to
be
accorded
to
public
school
officials
was
extremely
broad
and
this
court
should
intervene
only
in
a
clear
case
of
constitutional
violation
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
case
involves
no
such
clear
case
of
constitutional
violation.
if
the
court
please,
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
might
briefly,
address
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process.
as
has
been
noted,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
the
march
2,
1972
hearing
may
have
cured
any
prior
procedural
defect.
indeed,
the
students
and
their
counsel
were
granted
every
benefit
that
they
claim
in
their
brief.
they
had
notices
of
the
meeting.
they
had
a
statement
of
facts
upon
which
the
action
was
taken
at
the
inception
of
the
meeting.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
appear
to
present
any
witnesses
they
cared
to
present.
they
were
represented
by
a
counsel.
and
if
that
doesn't
constitute
procedural
due
process
in
the
public
school
context,
then
i
don't
know
what
does.
the
procedural
due
process
issue
will
not
sustain
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done.
i
would
assume
that
if
the
defect
is
found
in
the
procedures,
the
remedy
is
to
remand
the
case
and
give
them
a
new
hearing.
now,
what
on
earth
are
they
going
to
do
when
they
give
them
a
new
hearing?
what
kind
of
evidence
would
be
presented
at
that
point
that
already
has
been
presented?
the
point
is
that
the
school
board
construed
its
regulation
to
reach
alcoholic
beverages.
mrs.
gilford,
a
school
board
member,
testified
at
the
trial
that
when
the
rule
was
enacted,
there
was
no
discussion
of
a
legal
definition
of
intoxicating
liquor,
that
the
words
intoxicating
and
alcoholic
were
synonymous.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
your
honor,
that's
not
in
the
record.
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
the
question
if
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
with
their
class.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
graduated
this
past
spring.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
sir,
by
taking
a
correspondence
course
and
one
other
extra
course.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
i
would
assume
that
under
those
circumstances,
there's
--
mr.
g.
ross
smith
--
distinct
possibility
that
the
students
would
pursue
their
damage
claim
against
the
individual
school
board
members,
since
they
have
had
at
least
take
up
two
extra
courses
at
that
point.
it
was
a
serious
punishment.
the
point
is
not
whether
any
of
the
federal
judiciary
agrees
with
whether
it
was
a
punishment
or
not.
the
point
is
whether
it's
a
decision
that
this
school
board
is
entitled
to
make.
the
board
is
in
a
county
in
which
the
citizens
of
the
county
have
made
a
decision
that
they
think,
possession
or
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
is
a
serious
matter.
and
we
submit
this
honorable
court
should
not
intervene
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
school
board.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
ross
smith
yes,
sir.
