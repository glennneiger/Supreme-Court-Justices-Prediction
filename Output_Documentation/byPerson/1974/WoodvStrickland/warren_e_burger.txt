mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

e.

well,
is
it
illegal
in
this
county?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
the
scheuer
against
rhodes'
opinion
down
by
the
time
the
court,
i
think
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
cited
in
the
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
core.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
was
her
name
in
the
pleadings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
her
name
in
the
pleadings
if
she
never
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
little
cryptic
to
me.
exactly
what
they
had
done
was
it
--
what
is
alleged,
that
is
that
they
went
over
to
oklahoma
and
got
some
beer
and
brought
it
back
and
put
in
the
punch
bowl?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
dispute
over
that
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
illegal
conduct
in
that
county?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
it
violate
any
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
you
do
not
question
that
the
girls
who
were
guilty
of
some
illegal
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
a
question
of
how
you
define
that
illegal
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
defending
on
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
two
students
were
found
sitting
in
the
classroom
drinking
beer
right
out
of
the
original
bottles,
your
theory
of
this
case
would
be
exactly
the
same
that
the
school
board
could
not
do
what
it
did
here
in
the
way
that
it
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
they
could
drink
beer
with
impunity
even
though
it's
illegal
to
possess
it
in
that
county?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
brings
us
around
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
just
precisely,
how
is
that
a
federal
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
federal
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
the
procedure
or
the
beer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
--
you
do
concede
--
you
do
concede
that
the
school
board
would
have
an
inherent
power
to
impose
a
punishment
for
drinking
this
same
beer
in
the
classroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
could
not
impose
such
a
severe
punishment
as
was
imposed
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
--
that's
your
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
thing
that
might
happen
is
that
they'd
go
into
the
state
courts,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
that
the
custom
until
just
a
few
years
ago?
chief

warren
e.

thank
you,
mr.

do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.

they
made
up
the
year
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
mr.
smith
the
federal
question
does
not
arise
out
of
a
mere
mistake
of
judgment
by
school
board?m
chief

mr.
