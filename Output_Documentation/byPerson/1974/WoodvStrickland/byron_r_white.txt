just
like
sand
case.
justice
byron

white
a
no
evidence
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
immunity
claim
is
we
can
prolong
too,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
then
--
and
you
said
that,
there's
something
closer
to
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
objective
of
good
faith
standard,
i
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
was
an
order
in
the
rhodes?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
a
subject
in
bad
faith
or
objective
bad
faith,
i
am
sure
your
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
subjective.
justice
byron
r.
white
coupled
with
good
faith
belief?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
be
that
the
14
year-old
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
satisfied
to
show
your
standard
or
not
with
the
rhodes
standards
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
--
so
you're
not
satisfied
with
it
but
to
show
here
is
that
rhodes
is
the
law,
isn't
it
and
the
lower
court
instructed
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
--
you
do
maintain
--
one
your
questions
you
want
reviewed
here
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
its
immunity
ruling?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
its
standard
ruling,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
happens
--.
i
would
suppose
the
rhodes
said
that
you
might
think
--
you
might
subjectively
say
that
you
were
in
good
faith
but
it
might
be
that
you
didn't
have
reasonable
grounds
to
think
so,
in
which
event
you
are
not
immune
from
the
rhodes?
justice
byron
r.
white
she
was
a
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
couldn't
afford
the
print
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
record
is
here,
is
it
in
typewritten?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
transcribed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
assume
the
original
record
is
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
ever
get
to
the
court?
it
never
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
think,
they
think
for
their
purposes
of
their
rule,
it
is
intoxicating,
that's
what
they
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
grounds
for
it,
the
rationale
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
as
to
whether
the
reason
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
your
favor
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
intoxicating
beverage
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
school
board
construed
its
own
regulation,
meaning,
intoxicating
is
equivalent
to
alcoholic,
what's
the
federal
court
got
to
do
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
then
pressing
a
procedural
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
could
disagree
on
the
court
of
appeals,
i
take
it
on
the
ground
that
they
used
here
such
as
the
due
process
and
you
could
still
win
on
the
procedural
question
which
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
one
meeting,
they
said
that
on
march
2
and
february
18
meeting
where
there
was
no
procedural
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least,
to
the
girls
miss
three
months
of
school
and
they
have
to
make
up
the
next
three
months
of
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
six
months,
that's
a
long
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
these
children
graduated
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
--
let's
assume
just
for
the
moment
that
the
school
board
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
reversed
but
the
case
was
remanded
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
a
denial
of
procedure
of
due
process,
that
the
suspension
had
been
imposed
not
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
but
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
let's
just
assume
that.
but
that,
as
far
as
they
can
tell,
they
were
--
validly
there
was
good
cause
to
throw
them
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
there
be
a
remedy
or
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
sand
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
no
evidence
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
immunity
claim
is
we
can
prolong
too,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
then
--
and
you
said
that,
there's
something
closer
to
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron

white
that
is
objective
of
good

think?

i
thought
that

justice
byron

either
a
subject
in
bad
faith
or
objective
bad
faith,
i
am
sure
your
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
subjective.
justice
byron
r.
white
coupled
with
good
faith
belief?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
be
that
the
14
year-old
--
justice
byron

white
are
you
satisfied
to
show
your
standard
or
not
with
the
rhodes
standards
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
--
so
you're
not
satisfied
with
it
but
to
show
here
is
that
rhodes
is
the
law,
isn't
it
and
the

justice

well
then,
what

you
do

you

then
happens

i

did

never

justice

but
they
think,
they
think
for
their
purposes
of
their

it
is
intoxicating,
that's
what
they
thought.
justice
byron

are
