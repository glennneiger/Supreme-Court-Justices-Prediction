the
balance
of
the
semester?
this

it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
that
would

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
your
statements
made
in
some
of
the
briefs
that
the
girls
lost
a
full
year.
how
could
they
lose
the
first
half
of
the
year
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
that
i
have
you
interrupted.
under
arkansas

how
long
does
a
student
--
how
long
is
a

blackmun
now
does
the
third
girl
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
has
the
third
girl
never
been
a
party
to
this
litigation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
she
apparently
was
the
main
force
behind
the
enterprise,
was
she
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
that
time,
were
you
representing
the
wall
girl?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
who
was
the
district
judge,
judge
williams?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
feel
that
this
would
have
made
a
difference
as
well
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
smith
that
there
isn't
any
dispute
as
to
the
facts
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
apart
from
that
one
feature,
is
there
any
dispute
about
the
facts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
you
put
on
or
try
to
these
omitted
facts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
core,
is
this
all
in
the
record
here?
it
seems
to
that
what
you
just
said
is
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'm
curious
as
to
what
is
still
missing
that
you're
complaining
about?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
these
are
the
facts
you've

the,
somewhere,
either
in
the
briefs
or
on
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
what
in
addition
is
still
missing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
doesn't
it
all
come
down
to
what
is
the
difference
between
intoxicated
in
alcoholic
and
here
there's
no
argument,
is
there,
about
this
being
an
alcoholic
beverage
and
is
there
any
argument
that
it
was
non-intoxicating
even
under
arkansas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
core,
we
approach
it
from
this
end.
suppose

this
regulation
spoke
in
terms
of
alcoholic
rather
than
intoxicating
beverages.
would
you
be
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
you
don't
know
why
they
bypassed
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
they
called
the
substantive
due
process
issue
was
easier
than
the
procedural
due
process
for
the
second
meeting?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
explain
to
me
too
the
injury
that
these

did
they
lose
a
year's

on
a
semesters
--

come

said
but

want
to
know
whether
it's
a
correct
statement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
isn't
this
just
a
new
fashion
kind
of
case
that
you
and
i
were
in

school,
we
got
bumstead
and
we
went
home.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
made
