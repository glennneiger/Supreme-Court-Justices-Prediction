mr.
ben
core
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
out
by
admitting
what
i'm
afraid
will
become
obvious
before
i'm
finished
and
that
is
i'm
not
a
constitutional
lawyer,
neither
am
i
a
civil
rights
lawyer.
i
was
in
two
civil
rights
cases
before
this
one.
one
was
settled
and
the
other
one
was
tried
and
not
appealed
and
then
this
one
has
brought
me
all
the
way
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court.
probably,
i
have
read
more
federal
court
cases
in
the
last,
since
this
case
has
been
going
than
i
had
read
in
anytime
prior
to
that
and
i
still
do
not
have
any
feeling
of
confidence
really
to
discuss
constitutional
law.
but
i
have
been
in
this
case
since
before
it
was
a
case
and
if
i
can
help
the
court
in
any
way,
perhaps
it
would
be
more
as
a
result
of
that
than
the
ability
to
discuss
constitutional
principles.
this
case
got
its
start
when
these
parents
and
children
came
to
me
to
get
me
to
help
them
get
the
school
board
to
meet
again.
they
had
been
spending,
this
was
on
the
24,
february
and
they
had
the
spent
the
intervening
six
days
in
an
effort
to
get
the
board
to
meet
again,
to
hear
them.
and
i
first
declined
to
take
the
case
at
all,
but
i
did
agree
to
go
with
them,
see
if
i
could
get
the
board
to
meet
again
and
go
with
them
and
we
would
get
our
knees
really
and
beg
for
mercy,
see
if
we
could
get
back
in,
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
case.
and
that
was
the
preliminary
to
the
meeting
of
march
2,
1972
and
at
that
time,
they
had
been
out
of
school
some
11
days.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
the
wall
girl
never
came
to
me.
just
crain
and
strickland
and
i
wish
wall
had
because
she
was
a
full-blood
indian
but
--
mr.
ben
core
she
was
a
full-blood
indian,
but
she
didn't
come.
mr.
ben
core
sir.
mr.
ben
core
she's
not
in
the
pleading.
jo
wall
is
not.
mr.
ben
core
well,
i
think
the
district
judge
would
have
ordered
the
school
board
to
put
these
kids
back
in
school.
i
think
if
we
have
had
a
member
of
minority
race,
i
think
--
mr.
ben
core
well,
again,
i'm
not
familiar
with
those
either.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
sir.
paul
x.
williams.
mr.
ben
core
well,
judging
from
what
he
said
that
the
first
hearing
your
honor.
he
said
that,
“if
these
were
little
colored
girls.
i'd
have
to
put
them
back
in
school.”
and
but
they're
white
girls
and
well,
you
know.
if
he
--
if
that
made
a
difference
to
him,
i
think
that
might
have
had.
if
we
--
it
had
to
be
indian,
but
any
rate,
we
didn't.
we
just
have
strickland
and
crain.
and
as
i
say,
this
--
the
first
meeting,
the
one
on
february
18,
1972
was
more
or
less
was
secret
meeting
as
far
as
the
parents
were
concerned
and
it
cannot
begin
to
rise
to
the
dignity
of
due
process,
either
procedural
or
substantive.
and
then
the
meeting
of
march
2
was
really
not
in
the
sense
of
a
hearing,
it
was
--
i
had
agreed
to
go
with
these
people
to
see
if
i
could
have
an
influence
with
them.
i
had
held
office
in
that
district
and
they
were
just
convinced
that
i
could.
i
was
not
convinced
but
i
went
with
them
to
trial
and
the
meeting
was
--
it
was
really
no
meeting.
it
was
just
exactly
what
we
had
in
mind,
that
is
going
in
and
apologize
and
ask
them
to
reinstate
us
and
they
offered
no
evidence.
they
--
we
didn't
see
their
witnesses.
i
had
asked
for
the
homeroom
teacher
to
be
there
and
she
had
talked
with
the
superintendent
and
asked
him
if
she
had
to
be
and
he
said
she
didn't
and
so
she
didn't
come.
so,
really,
the
march
2,
meeting
of
1972
is
not
a
meeting
that
furnished
either
procedural
or
substantive
due
process.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
i
do
not.
he
--
but
he
based
that
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
dispute
about
this
being
on
an
alcoholic
beverage
or
on
intoxicating
beverage
and
there
certainly
is.
mr.
ben
core
well,
they
have
left
out
many
facts
which
we
feel
to
be
pertinent.
they
have
not
disputed
any
facts
which
we
have
submitted.
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir,
they're
in
evidence.
see,
we
tried
the
case
for
four
days
but
we
did
not
bring
that
record
up
simply
because
of
the
cost.
see,
the
girls
took
the
appeal
from
the
district
court
and
they
had
--
the
district
court
had
dismissed
the
case
on
the
basis
of
these
motions
for
judgment
notwithstanding
no
verdict
which
was
the
equivalent
of
directed
verdict.
so,
it
raised
an
issue
of
law
and
we
just
took
up
enough
proof
to
show
that
there
were
issues
of
fact
that
need
to
be
resolved.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
couldn't
afford
that
record.
mr.
ben
core
right.
mr.
ben
core
well
no,
the
--
mr.
ben
core
the
evidence
--
no
sir.
the
evidence
that
was
taken
at
four
days
of
trial
was
never
sent
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
ben
core
it
had
been
since
the
board
took
this
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
ben
core
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i've
seen
it
but
i
returned
it
to
the
clerk.
mr.
ben
core
no,
sir.
mr.
ben
core
your
honor,
of
course,
they
were
not
at
the
february
18
hearing
at
all
but
at
the
march
2
meeting,
the
whole
procedure
was
for
the
girls
to
tell
the
school
board
what
they
did
and
they
did
tell,
when
i
say
the
girls
here,
i
mean
the
plaintiffs,
ms.
strickland
and
virginia
crain.
they
did
tell
the
board
exactly
what
they
had
done.
and
--
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir.
well,
--
mr.
ben
core
that's
again
leaving
out
what
we
think
is
some
important
facts.
jo
wall
was
the
one
who
knew
where
to
go.
virginia
and
peggy
didn't
and
they
went
with
her.
and
then
they
came
back
to
mena
and
bought
this
king
cooler,
some
60
ounces
of
it
and
mixed
it
all
together
and
then
took
it
to
the
campus
and
then
there
they
added
enough
water
to
make
a
gallon-and-a-half.
so,
you
have
0.76
ounces
of
alcohol
when
they
go
up
on
the
school
ground.
mr.
ben
core
yes.
this
is
or
at
least
enough
to
make
the
computation
of
7.68
ounce.
mr.
ben
core
well,
all
that
is
here
your
honor
is
the
two
hearings
which
held.
one
being
on
march
--
mr.
ben
core
right.
there
in
that
testimony,
it
was
taken
march
7
and
april
7.
mr.
ben
core
well,
we
had
the
--
we
had
the
parents
testified.
we
had
a
doctor,
hematologist
testified
about
the
effect
of
three
quarter
of
an
ounce
of
alcohol
on
an
average
man.
we
had
one
of
the
school
board
directors
testify,
two
of
them,
a
dr.
wood
and
mrs.
gilford
and
we
had
some
of
the
mothers
there
who
attended
this
mother-daughter
function
and
didn't
know
that
there
was
anything
in
there,
in
the
spiking
agent.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
definitely.
there
is
a
--
well,
no.
they
--
if
the
school
board
admits
that
it
was
not
intoxicating,
its
--
there
will
be
no
argument.
so,
that's
our
position,
if
not
intoxicating.
mr.
ben
core
that's
the
premise
they
proceeded
under
but
the
president
of
the
school
board
admitted
on
a
cross-examination
that
the
girls
had
not
violated
the
rule.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
sir.
mr.
ben
core
well,
yes.
you
mean,
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
or
not
the
children
should
be
given
any
--
mr.
ben
core
yes,
i
think
that's
true
that
there
was
none
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
truth
is
that
it
was
not
intoxicating.
mr.
ben
core
only
because
--
first,
it
was
not
your
honor
because
it
did
not
violate
any
law
concerning
intoxicating
beverage.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
it
violated
a
law
against
possessing
beer
that
did
not
have
the
arkansas
tax
paid
on
it.
and
this
is
what
they
got
rid
of
the
bottles
before
they
came
back,
i
suppose,
they
said
that
they
poured
it
out
in
the
milk
carton
before
they
came
back
across
the
state
line.
but
at
any
rate,
it
is
against
the
law
to
possess
it
without
the
arkansas
tax
being
paid
on
it.
mr.
ben
core
that's
true,
right.
mr.
ben
core
right.
but
of
course
--
mr.
ben
core
that's
correct.
mr.
ben
core
well,
i
believe
it's
the
procedural
problem
--
mr.
ben
core
--
your
honor,
because
if
they
had
proceeded
in
a
correct
manner,
then
they
would
have
determined
that
there
was
no
violation.
mr.
ben
core
well,
it's
not
really
that
point
that
i
believe
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction.
it's
the
fact
that
by
the
manner
in
which
the
school
board
proceeded
that
they
had
already
pronounced
a
very
serious
judgment
without
ever
having
found
out
that
there
was
either
no
violation
or
that
it
was
very
questionable
whether
there
was
any
violation
or
that
even
so
that
these
two
or
three
children
were
not
such
as
would
justify
this
type
of
penalty.
in
other
words,
how
far
--
if
they
had
proceeded
on
a
correct
manner,
they
would
never
have
pronounced
this
judgment
because
--
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir.
in
fact,
the
complaint,
and
i
take
the
issue
of
mr.
smith
on
that,
the
complaint
attacks
to
the
rule
as
being
invalid
because
it's
mandatory
and
does
not
permit
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir,
if
it
--
mr.
ben
core
i'm
sorry
i
couldn't
cite
you
a
case.
but
if
it
deprives
them
of
--
if
they
adopt
the
rule
which
when
enforced
will
deprive
them
of
a
federal
right,
then
i
would
say
it's
certainly
of
the
federal
courts
would
have
the
right
to
declare
it
invalid
and
that's
our
contention
here.
so,
we
think
the
rule
--
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir
and
i'm
glad
you
made
that
point
because
yes
we
think
the
procedure
in
addition
to
the
problem
with
the
rule,
we
think
the
procedure
which
the
board
follow
is
really
the
reason
that
they
pronounced
such
a
severe
judgment
on
a
childish
prank
with
girls
that
had
never
any
trouble
with
them
before.
we
think
that
their
procedure
is
what
led
them
into
this.
they
only
heard
from
two
teachers
and
the
teachers
had
done
nothing
except
talk
to
the
girls
and
the
girls
knew
nothing
about
what
they
had
gotten
or
what
they
put
in
there,
it
could've
been
anything.
and
any
sort
of
respectable
investigation
would
have
demonstrated
that
this
was
not
a
serious
manner,
calling
for
the
type
of
punishment
which
they
inflicted.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
involved,
cruel
and
unusual.
i
think
it's
also
equal
protection
is
involved
and
we
pleaded
it
in
the
complaint.
mr.
ben
core
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
ben
core
no,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
don't
believe
that
follows
your
honor.
i
would
think
this
that
what
should
be
done
is
that
children
should
be
called
in
and
it
should
be
discussed
with
them
and
if
indeed
they
just
flagrantly
violated
the
school
discipline
by
drinking
beer
even
though
it's
not
included
in
any
rule.
i
think
certainly,
this
one
should
be
inflicted
on
them.
mr.
ben
core
well,
we
feel
that
--
mr.
ben
core
--
that
the
state
of
arkansas
has
provided
this
right
or
this
opportunity
for
education.
and
the
procedure
which
they
have
followed
in
this
case
has
deprived
these
children
of
the
right
to
take
advantage
of
that
education
for
a
rather
drastic
--
mr.
ben
core
i
think
it's
the
procedure.
mr.
ben
core
well,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
ben
core
i
agree
with
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
sir.
they
bypassed
that
--
mr.
ben
core
right.
mr.
ben
core
right,
correct.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
except
the
defense
--
satisfied
on
deprival
of
substantive
due
process
and
didn't
feel
it
necessary
to
pass
on.
mr.
ben
core
i
wouldn't
hazard
to
guess
on
that,
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor.
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir.
what
happened,
they
took
correspondence
course
and
so
forth.
they
lost
the
credit
for
the
entire
year
and
they
had
to
repeat
the
entire
year.
mr.
ben
core
it
is
a
semester
basis.
mr.
ben
core
well,
no.
in
fact,
the
superintendent
testified
that
--
and
when
you
ask
me
if
it
worked
on
semester
basis,
true,
they
do
carry
it
in
the
semesters
but
the
superintendent
testified
that
it
was
--
that
they
would
fail
the
entire
10th
grade
and
have
to
repeat
the
entire
10th
grade.
he
said
that
even
if
they
were
expelled
on
their
last
day
of
the
second
semester,
they
lost
the
entire
year.
but
because
this
was
a
penalty
attached
to
being
expelled,
that's
what
he
said,
and
that's
in
the
testimony.
mr.
ben
core
that's
right.
mr.
ben
core
it
is
indeed
a
correct
statement.
mr.
ben
core
right
and
i
have
to
disagree
with
mr.
smith
on
that.
mr.
ben
core
and
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
ben
core
and
it
would
have
been
the
subject
matter
which
wouldn't
have
been
covered
until
the
second
semester
which
means
that
they'd
have
to
lay
out
an
entire
year.
now,
i
think
--
i
think
really,
the
factual
basis
of
the
case
is
so
compelling
that
mr.
smith
says,
he
predicts
dark
consequences
if
we
hold
that
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
in
this
type
situation.
i
would
really
rather
can
look
at
it
this
way
as
what's
going
to
happen
if
federal
courts
do
not
take
jurisdiction
in
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
ben
core
well,
that's
true
but
--
mr.
ben
core
well,
in
my
--
i've
practicing
a
little
over
--
i
am
well
over
in
the
24
year
and
i
don't
recall
any
suits
like
this
before.
i
don't
remember
reading
any
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court
reports
except
that
one
real
old
case
where
the
father
brought
a
suit
against
the
school
board
and
they
held
that
he
had
no
interest
in
and
that's
the
only
case
that
i
know
of.
mr.
ben
core
that's
right.
mr.
ben
core
that's
true,
that's
back
in
the
days
of
paternalism
that
our
district
judge
referred
to
when
he
heard
the
case.
mr.
ben
core
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ben
core
you
mean
state
courts?
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir.
and
of
course,
i've
been
in
them
quite
often
and
i'm
personally
acquainted
with
the
judges
and
--
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir,
he
came
from
booneville
by
which
is
only
35
miles
from
fort
smith.
mr.
ben
core
yes.
mr.
ben
core
he
served
for
over
20
years
as
a
chancellery
judge
before
he
was
a
district
judge.
mr.
ben
core
it's
85
miles
south
of
fort
smith.
it's
in
pope
county.
it's
the
county
seat
of
--
mr.
ben
core
right.
mr.
ben
core
it's
some
4,500
population.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
there
are,
i
believe,
two,
three
--
three
other
consolidated
schools
in
the
county.
and
so
they
would
--
their
jurisdiction
be
limited
to
their
district
which
is
the
mena
school.
mr.
ben
core
right.
mr.
ben
core
right.
and
of
course,
the
judges
know
all
the
school
directors
and
you
made
a
good
point
justice
blackmun.
if
you
read
what
judge
williams
said,
you
will
see
how
reluctant
he
was
to
order
the
school
board
to
do
what
he
fully
believed
they
ought
to
do.
and
i
think
you'd
have
the
same
problem
with
the
other
good
judges
there
and
i
don't
mean
to
criticize
them.
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
them
but
you'd
get
away
from
that
when
you
get
into
federal
court,
most
of
the
time.
we
didn't
here
because
judge
williams
was
from
booneville
and
had
been
on
the
school
board
and
so
forth.
and
as
i
say,
he's
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
i
certainly
don't
criticize
him
but
he
expressed
his
great
reluctance
to
order
these
school
directors
to
do
what
he
was
telling
them
in
effect
they
ought
to
do.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
he
never
did.
he
let
it
go
on
to
a
jury
and
then
he
sustained
these
motions
for
judgments
notwithstanding,
no
verdict.
but
again,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
factual
basis,
the
way
these
children
were
handled
is
the
most
compelling
argument
that
i
can
make
that
the
federal
courts
should
take
jurisdiction
and
should
provide
a
remedy.
thank
you.
mr.
ben
core
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
out
by
admitting
what
i'm
afraid
will
become
obvious
before
i'm
finished
and
that
is
i'm
not
a
constitutional
lawyer,
neither
am
i
a
civil
rights
lawyer.
i
was
in
two
civil
rights
cases
before
this
one.
one
was
settled
and
the
other
one
was
tried
and
not
appealed
and
then
this
one
has
brought
me
all
the
way
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court.
probably,
i
have
read
more
federal
court
cases
in
the
last,
since
this
case
has
been
going
than
i
had
read
in
anytime
prior
to
that
and
i
still
do
not
have
any
feeling
of
confidence
really
to
discuss
constitutional
law.
but
i
have
been
in
this
case
since
before
it
was
a
case
and
if
i
can
help
the
court
in
any
way,
perhaps
it
would
be
more
as
a
result
of
that
than
the
ability
to
discuss
constitutional
principles.
this
case
got
its
start
when
these
parents
and
children
came
to
me
to
get
me
to
help
them
get
the
school
board
to
meet
again.
they
had
been
spending,
this
was
on
the
24,
february
and
they
had
the
spent
the
intervening
six
days
in
an
effort
to
get
the
board
to
meet
again,
to
hear
them.
and
i
first
declined
to
take
the
case
at
all,
but
i
did
agree
to
go
with
them,
see
if
i
could
get
the
board
to
meet
again
and
go
with
them
and
we
would
get
our
knees
really
and
beg
for
mercy,
see
if
we
could
get
back
in,
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
case.
and
that
was
the
preliminary
to
the
meeting
of
march
2,
1972
and
at
that
time,
they
had
been
out
of
school
some
11
days.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
the
wall
girl
never
came
to
me.
just
crain
and
strickland
and
i
wish
wall
had
because
she
was
a
full-blood
indian
but
--
mr.
ben
core
she
was
a
full-blood
indian,
but
she
didn't
come.
mr.
ben
core
sir.
mr.
ben
core
she's
not
in
the
pleading.
jo
wall
is
not.
mr.
ben
core
well,
i
think
the
district
judge
would
have
ordered
the
school
board
to
put
these
kids
back
in
school.
i
think
if
we
have
had
a
member
of
minority
race,
i
think
--
mr.
ben
core
well,
again,
i'm
not
familiar
with
those
either.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
sir.
paul
x.
williams.
mr.
ben
core
well,
judging
from
what
he
said
that
the
first
hearing
your
honor.
he
said
that,
“if
these
were
little
colored
girls.
i'd
have
to
put
them
back
in
school.”
and
but
they're
white
girls
and
well,
you
know.
if
he
--
if
that
made
a
difference
to
him,
i
think
that
might
have
had.
if
we
--
it
had
to
be
indian,
but
any
rate,
we
didn't.
we
just
have
strickland
and
crain.
and
as
i
say,
this
--
the
first
meeting,
the
one
on
february
18,
1972
was
more
or
less
was
secret
meeting
as
far
as
the
parents
were
concerned
and
it
cannot
begin
to
rise
to
the
dignity
of
due
process,
either
procedural
or
substantive.
and
then
the
meeting
of
march
2
was
really
not
in
the
sense
of
a
hearing,
it
was
--
i
had
agreed
to
go
with
these
people
to
see
if
i
could
have
an
influence
with
them.
i
had
held
office
in
that
district
and
they
were
just
convinced
that
i
could.
i
was
not
convinced
but
i
went
with
them
to
trial
and
the
meeting
was
--
it
was
really
no
meeting.
it
was
just
exactly
what
we
had
in
mind,
that
is
going
in
and
apologize
and
ask
them
to
reinstate
us
and
they
offered
no
evidence.
they
--
we
didn't
see
their
witnesses.
i
had
asked
for
the
homeroom
teacher
to
be
there
and
she
had
talked
with
the
superintendent
and
asked
him
if
she
had
to
be
and
he
said
she
didn't
and
so
she
didn't
come.
so,
really,
the
march
2,
meeting
of
1972
is
not
a
meeting
that
furnished
either
procedural
or
substantive
due
process.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
i
do
not.
he
--
but
he
based
that
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
dispute
about
this
being
on
an
alcoholic
beverage
or
on
intoxicating
beverage
and
there
certainly
is.
mr.
ben
core
well,
they
have
left
out
many
facts
which
we
feel
to
be
pertinent.
they
have
not
disputed
any
facts
which
we
have
submitted.
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir,
they're
in
evidence.
see,
we
tried
the
case
for
four
days
but
we
did
not
bring
that
record
up
simply
because
of
the
cost.
see,
the
girls
took
the
appeal
from
the
district
court
and
they
had
--
the
district
court
had
dismissed
the
case
on
the
basis
of
these
motions
for
judgment
notwithstanding
no
verdict
which
was
the
equivalent
of
directed
verdict.
so,
it
raised
an
issue
of
law
and
we
just
took
up
enough
proof
to
show
that
there
were
issues
of
fact
that
need
to
be
resolved.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
couldn't
afford
that
record.
mr.
ben
core
right.
mr.
ben
core
well
no,
the
--
mr.
ben
core
the
evidence
--
no
sir.
the
evidence
that
was
taken
at
four
days
of
trial
was
never
sent
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
ben
core
it
had
been
since
the
board
took
this
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
ben
core
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i've
seen
it
but
i
returned
it
to
the
clerk.
mr.
ben
core
no,
sir.
mr.
ben
core
your
honor,
of
course,
they
were
not
at
the
february
18
hearing
at
all
but
at
the
march
2
meeting,
the
whole
procedure
was
for
the
girls
to
tell
the
school
board
what
they
did
and
they
did
tell,
when
i
say
the
girls
here,
i
mean
the
plaintiffs,
ms.
strickland
and
virginia
crain.
they
did
tell
the
board
exactly
what
they
had
done.
and
--
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir.
well,
--
mr.
ben
core
that's
again
leaving
out
what
we
think
is
some
important
facts.
jo
wall
was
the
one
who
knew
where
to
go.
virginia
and
peggy
didn't
and
they
went
with
her.
and
then
they
came
back
to
mena
and
bought
this
king
cooler,
some
60
ounces
of
it
and
mixed
it
all
together
and
then
took
it
to
the
campus
and
then
there
they
added
enough
water
to
make
a
gallon-and-a-half.
so,
you
have
0.76
ounces
of
alcohol
when
they
go
up
on
the
school
ground.
mr.
ben
core
yes.
this
is
or
at
least
enough
to
make
the
computation
of
7.68
ounce.
mr.
ben
core
well,
all
that
is
here
your
honor
is
the
two
hearings
which
held.
one
being
on
march
--
mr.
ben
core
right.
there
in
that
testimony,
it
was
taken
march
7
and
april
7.
mr.
ben
core
well,
we
had
the
--
we
had
the
parents
testified.
we
had
a
doctor,
hematologist
testified
about
the
effect
of
three
quarter
of
an
ounce
of
alcohol
on
an
average
man.
we
had
one
of
the
school
board
directors
testify,
two
of
them,
a
dr.
wood
and
mrs.
gilford
and
we
had
some
of
the
mothers
there
who
attended
this
mother-daughter
function
and
didn't
know
that
there
was
anything
in
there,
in
the
spiking
agent.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
definitely.
there
is
a
--
well,
no.
they
--
if
the
school
board
admits
that
it
was
not
intoxicating,
its
--
there
will
be
no
argument.
so,
that's
our
position,
if
not
intoxicating.
mr.
ben
core
that's
the
premise
they
proceeded
under
but
the
president
of
the
school
board
admitted
on
a
cross-examination
that
the
girls
had
not
violated
the
rule.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
sir.
mr.
ben
core
well,
yes.
you
mean,
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
or
not
the
children
should
be
given
any
--
mr.
ben
core
yes,
i
think
that's
true
that
there
was
none
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
truth
is
that
it
was
not
intoxicating.
mr.
ben
core
only
because
--
first,
it
was
not
your
honor
because
it
did
not
violate
any
law
concerning
intoxicating
beverage.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
it
violated
a
law
against
possessing
beer
that
did
not
have
the
arkansas
tax
paid
on
it.
and
this
is
what
they
got
rid
of
the
bottles
before
they
came
back,
i
suppose,
they
said
that
they
poured
it
out
in
the
milk
carton
before
they
came
back
across
the
state
line.
but
at
any
rate,
it
is
against
the
law
to
possess
it
without
the
arkansas
tax
being
paid
on
it.
mr.
ben
core
that's
true,
right.
mr.
ben
core
right.
but
of
course
--
mr.
ben
core
that's
correct.
mr.
ben
core
well,
i
believe
it's
the
procedural
problem
--
mr.
ben
core
--
your
honor,
because
if
they
had
proceeded
in
a
correct
manner,
then
they
would
have
determined
that
there
was
no
violation.
mr.
ben
core
well,
it's
not
really
that
point
that
i
believe
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction.
it's
the
fact
that
by
the
manner
in
which
the
school
board
proceeded
that
they
had
already
pronounced
a
very
serious
judgment
without
ever
having
found
out
that
there
was
either
no
violation
or
that
it
was
very
questionable
whether
there
was
any
violation
or
that
even
so
that
these
two
or
three
children
were
not
such
as
would
justify
this
type
of
penalty.
in
other
words,
how
far
--
if
they
had
proceeded
on
a
correct
manner,
they
would
never
have
pronounced
this
judgment
because
--
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir.
in
fact,
the
complaint,
and
i
take
the
issue
of
mr.
smith
on
that,
the
complaint
attacks
to
the
rule
as
being
invalid
because
it's
mandatory
and
does
not
permit
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir,
if
it
--
mr.
ben
core
i'm
sorry
i
couldn't
cite
you
a
case.
but
if
it
deprives
them
of
--
if
they
adopt
the
rule
which
when
enforced
will
deprive
them
of
a
federal
right,
then
i
would
say
it's
certainly
of
the
federal
courts
would
have
the
right
to
declare
it
invalid
and
that's
our
contention
here.
so,
we
think
the
rule
--
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir
and
i'm
glad
you
made
that
point
because
yes
we
think
the
procedure
in
addition
to
the
problem
with
the
rule,
we
think
the
procedure
which
the
board
follow
is
really
the
reason
that
they
pronounced
such
a
severe
judgment
on
a
childish
prank
with
girls
that
had
never
any
trouble
with
them
before.
we
think
that
their
procedure
is
what
led
them
into
this.
they
only
heard
from
two
teachers
and
the
teachers
had
done
nothing
except
talk
to
the
girls
and
the
girls
knew
nothing
about
what
they
had
gotten
or
what
they
put
in
there,
it
could've
been
anything.
and
any
sort
of
respectable
investigation
would
have
demonstrated
that
this
was
not
a
serious
manner,
calling
for
the
type
of
punishment
which
they
inflicted.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
involved,
cruel
and
unusual.
i
think
it's
also
equal
protection
is
involved
and
we
pleaded
it
in
the
complaint.
mr.
ben
core
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
ben
core
no,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
don't
believe
that
follows
your
honor.
i
would
think
this
that
what
should
be
done
is
that
children
should
be
called
in
and
it
should
be
discussed
with
them
and
if
indeed
they
just
flagrantly
violated
the
school
discipline
by
drinking
beer
even
though
it's
not
included
in
any
rule.
i
think
certainly,
this
one
should
be
inflicted
on
them.
mr.
ben
core
well,
we
feel
that
--
mr.
ben
core
--
that
the
state
of
arkansas
has
provided
this
right
or
this
opportunity
for
education.
and
the
procedure
which
they
have
followed
in
this
case
has
deprived
these
children
of
the
right
to
take
advantage
of
that
education
for
a
rather
drastic
--
mr.
ben
core
i
think
it's
the
procedure.
mr.
ben
core
well,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
ben
core
i
agree
with
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
ben
core
yes,
sir.
they
bypassed
that
--
mr.
ben
core
right.
mr.
ben
core
right,
correct.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
except
the
defense
--
satisfied
on
deprival
of
substantive
due
process
and
didn't
feel
it
necessary
to
pass
on.
mr.
ben
core
i
wouldn't
hazard
to
guess
on
that,
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor.
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir.
what
happened,
they
took
correspondence
course
and
so
forth.
they
lost
the
credit
for
the
entire
year
and
they
had
to
repeat
the
entire
year.
mr.
ben
core
it
is
a
semester
basis.
mr.
ben
core
well,
no.
in
fact,
the
superintendent
testified
that
--
and
when
you
ask
me
if
it
worked
on
semester
basis,
true,
they
do
carry
it
in
the
semesters
but
the
superintendent
testified
that
it
was
--
that
they
would
fail
the
entire
10th
grade
and
have
to
repeat
the
entire
10th
grade.
he
said
that
even
if
they
were
expelled
on
their
last
day
of
the
second
semester,
they
lost
the
entire
year.
but
because
this
was
a
penalty
attached
to
being
expelled,
that's
what
he
said,
and
that's
in
the
testimony.
mr.
ben
core
that's
right.
mr.
ben
core
it
is
indeed
a
correct
statement.
mr.
ben
core
right
and
i
have
to
disagree
with
mr.
smith
on
that.
mr.
ben
core
and
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
ben
core
and
it
would
have
been
the
subject
matter
which
wouldn't
have
been
covered
until
the
second
semester
which
means
that
they'd
have
to
lay
out
an
entire
year.
now,
i
think
--
i
think
really,
the
factual
basis
of
the
case
is
so
compelling
that
mr.
smith
says,
he
predicts
dark
consequences
if
we
hold
that
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
in
this
type
situation.
i
would
really
rather
can
look
at
it
this
way
as
what's
going
to
happen
if
federal
courts
do
not
take
jurisdiction
in
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
ben
core
well,
that's
true
but
--
mr.
ben
core
well,
in
my
--
i've
practicing
a
little
over
--
i
am
well
over
in
the
24
year
and
i
don't
recall
any
suits
like
this
before.
i
don't
remember
reading
any
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court
reports
except
that
one
real
old
case
where
the
father
brought
a
suit
against
the
school
board
and
they
held
that
he
had
no
interest
in
and
that's
the
only
case
that
i
know
of.
mr.
ben
core
that's
right.
mr.
ben
core
that's
true,
that's
back
in
the
days
of
paternalism
that
our
district
judge
referred
to
when
he
heard
the
case.
mr.
ben
core
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ben
core
you
mean
state
courts?
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir.
and
of
course,
i've
been
in
them
quite
often
and
i'm
personally
acquainted
with
the
judges
and
--
mr.
ben
core
yes
sir,
he
came
from
booneville
by
which
is
only
35
miles
from
fort
smith.
mr.
ben
core
yes.
mr.
ben
core
he
served
for
over
20
years
as
a
chancellery
judge
before
he
was
a
district
judge.
mr.
ben
core
it's
85
miles
south
of
fort
smith.
it's
in
pope
county.
it's
the
county
seat
of
--
mr.
ben
core
right.
mr.
ben
core
it's
some
4,500
population.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
there
are,
i
believe,
two,
three
--
three
other
consolidated
schools
in
the
county.
and
so
they
would
--
their
jurisdiction
be
limited
to
their
district
which
is
the
mena
school.
mr.
ben
core
right.
mr.
ben
core
right.
and
of
course,
the
judges
know
all
the
school
directors
and
you
made
a
good
point
justice
blackmun.
if
you
read
what
judge
williams
said,
you
will
see
how
reluctant
he
was
to
order
the
school
board
to
do
what
he
fully
believed
they
ought
to
do.
and
i
think
you'd
have
the
same
problem
with
the
other
good
judges
there
and
i
don't
mean
to
criticize
them.
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
them
but
you'd
get
away
from
that
when
you
get
into
federal
court,
most
of
the
time.
we
didn't
here
because
judge
williams
was
from
booneville
and
had
been
on
the
school
board
and
so
forth.
and
as
i
say,
he's
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
i
certainly
don't
criticize
him
but
he
expressed
his
great
reluctance
to
order
these
school
directors
to
do
what
he
was
telling
them
in
effect
they
ought
to
do.
mr.
ben
core
no
sir,
he
never
did.
he
let
it
go
on
to
a
jury
and
then
he
sustained
these
motions
for
judgments
notwithstanding,
no
verdict.
but
again,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
factual
basis,
the
way
these
children
were
handled
is
the
most
compelling
argument
that
i
can
make
that
the
federal
courts
should
take
jurisdiction
and
should
provide
a
remedy.
thank
you.
