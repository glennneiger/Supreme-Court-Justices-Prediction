justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
based
its
opinion
on
substantive
due
process
but
i
didn't
read
its
opinion
as
saying
that
the
school
board
couldn't
as
a
matter
of
substantive
regulation
provide
that
you
could
expel
a
person
for
putting
the
beer
in
a
punch.
i
read
it
more
as
a
kind
of
review
of
the
evidence
type
of
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
is
the
court
of
appeals
able
to
review
the
district
court's
action
if
there
were
--
if
there
wasn't
a
transcript
of
the
evidence?
what
basis
did
it
use
to
review
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
been
reading
some
of
our
indian
case.[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
the
school
board,
did
your
clients
contest
the
basic
factual
claim
that
they
had
gotten
the
so-called
malt
beverage
over
in
oklahoma
and
put
it
in
the
punch
bowl?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
or
more
properly,
to
what
extent
should
a
federal
court
in
a
1983
action
second
guess
a
school
board's
decision
that
that
regulation
was
violated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
federal
claim?
you
said,
the
constitution
prohibits
a
school
board
from
adopting
a
mandatory
rule
like
this
and
not
taking
the
consideration
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
of
ours
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
didn't
actually
order
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
their
sophomore
year
ended
june
of
1972,
didn't
it?
