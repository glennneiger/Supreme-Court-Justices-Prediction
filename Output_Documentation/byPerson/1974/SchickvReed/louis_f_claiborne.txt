mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
begin
with
the
last
point
touched
upon
by
my
opponent
which
is
to
say,
the
propriety
of
the
no-parole
condition
which
is
attached
by
the
president
when
he
commuted
such
in
schick's
death
sentence.
as
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
has
narrowed
the
point,
my
opponent
is
not
clear
whether
he
is
saying
that
one
must
look
to
the
penalties
or
punishments
provided
by
the
murder
statute
in
your
article
118
of
the
code
on
whether
one
simply
looks
to
the
federal
criminal
law
or
the
criminal
law
as
a
whole
to
determine
the
issue
which
he
puts
which
is
can
the
president
invent
a
new
novel
penalty
punishment
alien
to
american
law.
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
we
may
assume,
though
the
court
has
never
so
held
and
it's
arguable
that
only
other
constitutional
limitations
applies
such
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
we
may
assume
that
the
president
enjoys
no
power
to
create
a
totally
novel
or
bizarre
penalty
which
is
elsewhere
unknown
in
the
criminal
laws
of
the
united
states.
but
that
is
simply
not
this
case.
to
be
sure,
article
118,
the
murder
statute
in
the
military
case
provides
only
two
alternatives,
death
or
life
imprisonment
with
normally,
eligibility
for
parole,
but
other
laws
in
the
untied
states
including
a
specific
federal
statute,
do
envisage
life
imprisonment
without
a
parole.
so
we're
not
in
the
area
of
a
novel
invention,
the
creation
of
a
new
penalty
which
arguably
might
present
a
difficult
constitutional
question.
we're
dealing
with
a
condition
which
is
only
recently
affirmed
by
congress
as
a
proper
punishment
in
the
federal
system
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
pointed
out.
we're
also
dealing
with
the
provision
which
is
common
in
the
laws
of
20
states
and
many
times
for
murder,
often
for
all
life
sentences,
the
eligibility
for
parole
which
is
otherwise
available
is
denied
in
the
case
of
life
sentence.
nothing
therefore
extraordinary
in
this
provision
and
therefore,
nothing
beyond
the
power
of
the
president
unless
he
is
confined
to
the
same
alternatives
the
judge
would
be,
and
of
course
he
is
not.
one
need
take
only
the
example
of
a
judge
who
sentences
to
the
statutory
minimum,
the
result
would
be
that
the
president
cannot
exercise
his
power
of
mercy
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
marshall,
so
far
as
our
research
indicates,
president
eisenhower
on
five
occasions,
include
--
five
occasions
in
addition
to
this
one,
commuted
death
sentences
with
the
condition
of
no
parole.
one
other
case
it
was
life,
the
other
case
is
it
was
periods
of
55
or
45
years
with
no-parole
eligibility.
the
attorney
general
brownell,
who
wrote
an
opinion
for
president
eisenhower
with
respect
to
these
cases,
indicates
that
president
wilson
had
on
two
occasions
done
the
same
thing.
of
course,
there
was
no
occasion
to
do
so
before
1913
because
parole
in
the
case
of
a
life
sentence
was
not
the
rule.
in
fact,
it
was
unavailable
generally
before
1910
in
the
case
of
life
sentences
before
1913.
so,
we
don't
expect
to
find
a
long
backward
history
of
this
except
as
i
say
mr.
justice
throughout
the
experience
of
20
states
in
which
life
sentences
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
do
have
of
course,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun,
pointed
out
the
narcotic
statute
which
does
expressly
as
a
matter
of
congressional
decision
did
not
grow.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
that
i'm
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
undoubtedly
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
mr.
justice
marshall,
six
instances
by
president
eisenhower
and
two
by
president
wilson.
the
decisions
of
the
president
in
commutation
matters
are
not
published
and
whether
research
were
thorough
would
produce
other
instances
i
don't
know.
so
far
as
i'm
able
to
say
those
are
the
only
instances.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
military
death
sentence
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
sentences
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
military
death
sentences
during
president
eisenhower's
period
in
office
would
at
a
guess
and
it's
really
a
guess
because
the
figures
are
divided
in
ways
that
don't
show
it
too
clearly
of
something
in
the
order
of
20.
now,
let
me
say
finally
on
this
point
that
there
is
no
statutory
bar
even
assuming
that
a
statutory
bar
to
this
sort
of
condition
attached
to
a
presidential
pardon
were
constitutionally
relevant.
the
very
statute
involved
here
under
the
uniform
military
code
specifically
authorizes
the
president
to
commute
a
sentence
to
such
lesser
punishment
as
he
sees
fit
leaving
him
a
full
sway,
full
of
discretion.
the
general
parole
statute
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
initially
had
a
provision
which
specifically
says
this
is
in
no
way
meant
to
control
or
fetter
the
discretion
of
the
president
when
exercising
its
constitutional
power
of
pardon.
now,
let
me
say
that
the
relevance
of
this
issue
is
important
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
mandatory
death
sentence
passes
constitutional
muster
because
in
that
event
it
will
indeed
be
important
to
recognize
in
the
president
a
power
to
commute
or
in
governors
of
states
the
power
to
commute
any
mandatory
death
sentence.
but
in
at
least
the
most
shocking
cases,
once
cannot
expect
that
a
power
of
clemency
to
be
exercised
if
the
alternative
use
here
is
unavailable.
and
yet
the
result
would
be
if
the
alternative
were
available
to
encourage
the
commutation
of
death
sentences
when
the
chief
executive,
whether
the
united
states
service
is
in
a
position
to
assure
that
there
will
be
no
automatic
eligibility
for
parole
in
15
years,
which
does
not
deprive
him
of
a
later
opportunity
or
of
his
successor
of
an
opportunity
to
reconsider
the
matter
at
a
later
time
nor
indeed
does
it
in
this
case.
now,
leaving
that
question
and
turning
to
furman
versus
georgia.
it
is
said
that
furman
versus
georgia
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
fully
retroactive.
and
it
is
true
that
in
two
cases
in
michigan
versus
payne
and
in
robinson
versus
neil,
this
court
so
characterized
its
prior
holdings
with
respect
to
furman
and
georgia.
i
don't
want
to
quibble
that
terminology
but
it
is
at
least
arguable
that
all
the
court
has
ever
held
with
respect
to
furman
is
that
it
will
prevent
the
present
execution
of
any
death
sentence
no
matter
when
imposed.
the
court
has
not
had
occasion
to
hold
and
has
not
held
that
furman
versus
georgia
is
fully
retroactive
in
the
same
sense
as
it's
held
gideon
versus
wainwright
fully
retroactive.
for
instance,
i
don't
suppose
the
court
has
had
before
it
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
has
foreclosed
itself
from
ruling
if
a
criminal
at
the
prison
now
should
come
before
the
court
and
say,
"i
plead
guilty
out
of
fear
of
a
death
penalty
which
this
court
has
now
ruled
was
unconstitutional
and
therefore,
i
want
to
withdraw
my
plea
and
have
a
trial."
that
would
be
fully
retroactive
application
of
furman.
if
the
court
were
to
force
such
a
prisoner
a
reopening
of
his
conviction
on
a
plea
of
guilty
and
it's
not
an
unreal
hypothesis.
there
may
indeed
also
be
civil
consequences
that
flow
from
a
full
retroactive
application
of
furman.
(audio
abruptly
cut
00:35:34-00:35:40)i'm
not
sure
what
they
would
be.
well,
they
deal
with
life
insurance
policies
or
other
matters.
but
this
court
hasn't
left
that
question
open.
now,
let's
say
that
the
court
has
not
closed
the
door.
of
course,
this
is
not
to
indicate
how
you
don't
want
to
decide
it
now
that
the
question
may
be
presented.
we
analyze
it
this
way.
we
say
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
furman,
when
one
puts
together
the
opinions
of
the
members
of
the
court
who
constituted
majority.
it
seemed
to
turn
on
two
findings.
the
first
is
that
the
public
attitudes
of
today
with
strong
emphasis
on
the
very
recent
past
indicate
a
rejection
of
the
death
penalty
as
unnecessarily
cruel.
also,
the
experience
of
the
recent
past
in
the
civilian
context
in
the
united
states,
indicates
that
the
administration
of
a
death
penalty
has
been
so
random,
so
freakish,
so
discriminatory,
so
haphazard
that
it
is
unusual
and
cruel
to
impose
it
or
carry
it
out
today.
to
effectuate
those
policies,
it
is
not
necessarily
required
to
go
back
20
years
to
invalidate
a
death
sentence
which
has
already
been
commuted
14
years
ago
and
to
look
to
the
collateral
consequences
of
the
death
sentence.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
approach
followed
in
michigan
versus
payne
is
appropriate
here.
and
it's
true
that
in
michigan
versus
payne,
the
court
declined
to
make
any
retrospective
application.
eventhough,
all
that
was
at
stake
was
sentenced
just
as
here.
now
here
the
court
has
gone
somewhat
further,
it
has
said,
"we
will
require
resentencing
whether
it's
still
a
realistic
alternative."
but
it
need
not
necessarily
go
over
further
step
of
undoing
the
commutation
which
was
premised
on
a
death
sentence
which
was
imposed
at
a
time
when
this
court
might
not
have
found
imposition
freakish
or
contrary
to
prevalent
attitudes.
now
finally,
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
at
all
events,
furman
should
be
applied
in
military
context.
i
owe
the
court
an
apology
for
raising
this
issue
so
late
in
the
day.
part
of
the
explanation
is
that
in
the
district
court,
furman
had
not
yet
been
decided
when
the
case
is
in
the
district
court.
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
furman.
in
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeal,
my
friend
invoked
furman
only
by
analogy,
that
is
to
suggest
that
the
no-parole
condition
for
the
reasons
given
by
majority
in
furman
violated
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause.
an
argument
no
longer
pressed
here
nor
indeed
put
by
the
petition
of
certiorari
only
if
the
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeal
was
it
suggested
that
furman
had
any
direct
application
to
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
court
of
appeals.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
been
too
far
away,
it
was
just
meant.
now,
even
so
we
should
raise
the
point
in
our
brief
in
our
position
in
this
court.
we
were
slow
in
seeing
it.
it
is,
however,
it
seems
to
us
an
important
point
if
they
ought
not
be
decided
backhandedly
in
this
case.
my
opponent
spends
a
very
great
deal
of
time
in
his
reply
brief
proving
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
concept
applies
to
the
military.
without
quibbling,
this
court
has
indeed
never
held
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
constitution
applies
to
military,
there
are
four
votes
for
that
proposition
in
travis
versus
dallas
and
only
one
court
of
appeal
has
directly
so
held.
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
we
may
assume
that
article
55
of
the
code
enacts
the
same
standard
for
the
military
and
i'm
willing
to
treat
it
under
that
same
extent.
but
it
does
not
follow
that
what
is
cruel
and
unusual
in
this
civilian
context
is
ipso
facto
cruel
and
unusual
in
the
military
system.
cruelty
is
relative,
war
is
cruel
and
the
reasons
underlying
this
court's
decision
in
furman
for
finding
the
death
penalty
cruel
and
unusual
mainly
not
be
applicable
in
the
military
context.
there
may
be
a
special
need
for
deterrent
in
military
conditions
and
there,
it
may
be
more
important
to
look
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
in
the
area
on
the
battlefield
which
may
have
a
very
real
deterrent
whatever
happens
on
review.
on
the
other
hand,
the
freakish
and
haphazard
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
which
persuaded
this
court
to
hold
such
discretionary
penalties
unconstitutional
in
civilian
context
is
not
so
likely
in
the
military.
if
only
because
there
are
so
many
levels
of
review
of
sentence,
something
unknown
to
the
civil
system.
first
of
all,
the
convening
authority
must
make
a
decision
when
referring
a
case
whether
to
refer
it
as
a
capital
case
or
not,
a
first
screen.
if
the
court-martial
having
had
the
case
referred
to
it
as
capital
sentences
the
prisoner
to
the
death
penalty,
it
must
be
approved
by
the
convening
authority.
after
that
the
case
goes
to
the
court
of
military
review
which
has
a
gained
power
to
reduce
so
vary
--
to
commute
the
death
sentence.
then,
the
case
goes
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
has
no
power
to
vary
the
sentence
but
reviews
to
conviction
in
line
of
death
sentence.
but
finally,
in
every
death
sentence
case
at
a
single
level,
the
level
of
the
president,
we
have
a
review
of
the
death
sentences
imposed.
so,
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
with
a
centralized
system
and
these
levels
of
review,
we're
going
to
come
out
with
a
patent
that
is
less
freakish
to
use
mr.
justice
stewart's
terminology
than
we
find
in
so
many
disparate
jurisdictions
all
over
the
country
and
indeed
in
the
federal
civilian
system.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
slovik,
i
believe.
slovik
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
particular
case
of
sergeant
slovik,
i
cannot
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
course,
there
were
many
death
sentences
imposed
and
executed
in
world
war
ii.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
only
one
for
desertion.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
those
that
were
imposed
for
murder
one
doesn't
know
whether
it
was
the
murder
of
the
commanding
officer
or
an
officer
one
for
desertion,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
they
were,
they
were
something
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
speak
from
closer
experience
than
i
do.
i
do
know
from
what
few
figures
we
have,
that
there
were
indeed
several
imposed
then
only
one
carried
out
for
desertion.
there
were
many
for
other
crimes,
now,
i
must
say,
the
other
crimes
mostly
rape
than
murder.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
murder
one
doesn't
know
whether
that
was
military
or
not,
it
could
have
been.
but
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
court
has
a
basis
on
which
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
furman
or
to
apply
to
military.
i
am
suggesting
that
they're
all
sufficient
differences
so
that
the
court
order
hold
its
hand
and
if
it
reaches
that
issue
which
it
reaches
only
if
it
first
holds
that
furman
would
if
--
would
retroactively
apply
to
the
situation.
then,
you
have
to
decide
whether
it
applies
to
the
military
at
all.
in
that
event,
we
think
the
record
far
too
bear
the
facts,
figures
or
other
indications
as
to
the
deterrent
value,
as
to
the
actual
experience
are
not
explored
in
this
record.
and
the
court
ought
had
more
to
go
on
before
reaching
that
very
important
step.
accordingly,
should
the
court
go
so
far
in
the
case
within
the
appropriate
cause
would
have
to
be
a
remand
to
the
district
court
with
an
opportunity
for
presentation
of
evidence
and
of
statistics
which
would
furnish
that
court,
the
court
of
appeal
and
have
ultimately
this
court
with
a
concrete
record
on
which
to
make
that
important
decision.
now,
we've
recognized
that
this
is
a
hard
case.
we
do
want
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
president
once
imposes
this
sort
of
condition
that's
so
irrevocably.
it
is
as
attorney
general
brownell
made
clear
in
his
advice
to
president
eisenhower
open
to
that
president
to
any
of
the
successes
to
vary
the
condition
and
it
will
be
that
the
circumstances
would
justify
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
is
open
to
the
prisoner.
perhaps,
especially
so
in
the
military
context
in
which
the
president
serves
also
as
commander-in-chief
to
appeal
to
him
and
perhaps
that
procedure
in
the
military
doesn't
require
going
through
the
pardon
court,
i
really
can't
speak
too
authoritatively
about
that.
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
frankly
was
unaware.
he
tells
--
i
think
he
said
1968.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
--
i'm
not
for
a
moment
suggesting
that
i
have
any
basis
on
which
to
encourage
the
hope
that
such
an
application
would
be
successful.
on
the
other
hand,
six
years
had
been
gone
by.
there's
no
reason
not
to
reapply.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
begin
with
the
last
point
touched
upon
by
my
opponent
which
is
to
say,
the
propriety
of
the
no-parole
condition
which
is
attached
by
the
president
when
he
commuted
such
in
schick's
death
sentence.
as
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
has
narrowed
the
point,
my
opponent
is
not
clear
whether
he
is
saying
that
one
must
look
to
the
penalties
or
punishments
provided
by
the
murder
statute
in
your
article
118
of
the
code
on
whether
one
simply
looks
to
the
federal
criminal
law
or
the
criminal
law
as
a
whole
to
determine
the
issue
which
he
puts
which
is
can
the
president
invent
a
new
novel
penalty
punishment
alien
to
american
law.
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
we
may
assume,
though
the
court
has
never
so
held
and
it's
arguable
that
only
other
constitutional
limitations
applies
such
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
we
may
assume
that
the
president
enjoys
no
power
to
create
a
totally
novel
or
bizarre
penalty
which
is
elsewhere
unknown
in
the
criminal
laws
of
the
united
states.
but
that
is
simply
not
this
case.
to
be
sure,
article
118,
the
murder
statute
in
the
military
case
provides
only
two
alternatives,
death
or
life
imprisonment
with
normally,
eligibility
for
parole,
but
other
laws
in
the
untied
states
including
a
specific
federal
statute,
do
envisage
life
imprisonment
without
a
parole.
so
we're
not
in
the
area
of
a
novel
invention,
the
creation
of
a
new
penalty
which
arguably
might
present
a
difficult
constitutional
question.
we're
dealing
with
a
condition
which
is
only
recently
affirmed
by
congress
as
a
proper
punishment
in
the
federal
system
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
pointed
out.
we're
also
dealing
with
the
provision
which
is
common
in
the
laws
of
20
states
and
many
times
for
murder,
often
for
all
life
sentences,
the
eligibility
for
parole
which
is
otherwise
available
is
denied
in
the
case
of
life
sentence.
nothing
therefore
extraordinary
in
this
provision
and
therefore,
nothing
beyond
the
power
of
the
president
unless
he
is
confined
to
the
same
alternatives
the
judge
would
be,
and
of
course
he
is
not.
one
need
take
only
the
example
of
a
judge
who
sentences
to
the
statutory
minimum,
the
result
would
be
that
the
president
cannot
exercise
his
power
of
mercy
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
marshall,
so
far
as
our
research
indicates,
president
eisenhower
on
five
occasions,
include
--
five
occasions
in
addition
to
this
one,
commuted
death
sentences
with
the
condition
of
no
parole.
one
other
case
it
was
life,
the
other
case
is
it
was
periods
of
55
or
45
years
with
no-parole
eligibility.
the
attorney
general
brownell,
who
wrote
an
opinion
for
president
eisenhower
with
respect
to
these
cases,
indicates
that
president
wilson
had
on
two
occasions
done
the
same
thing.
of
course,
there
was
no
occasion
to
do
so
before
1913
because
parole
in
the
case
of
a
life
sentence
was
not
the
rule.
in
fact,
it
was
unavailable
generally
before
1910
in
the
case
of
life
sentences
before
1913.
so,
we
don't
expect
to
find
a
long
backward
history
of
this
except
as
i
say
mr.
justice
throughout
the
experience
of
20
states
in
which
life
sentences
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
do
have
of
course,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun,
pointed
out
the
narcotic
statute
which
does
expressly
as
a
matter
of
congressional
decision
did
not
grow.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
that
i'm
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
undoubtedly
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
mr.
justice
marshall,
six
instances
by
president
eisenhower
and
two
by
president
wilson.
the
decisions
of
the
president
in
commutation
matters
are
not
published
and
whether
research
were
thorough
would
produce
other
instances
i
don't
know.
so
far
as
i'm
able
to
say
those
are
the
only
instances.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
military
death
sentence
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
sentences
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
military
death
sentences
during
president
eisenhower's
period
in
office
would
at
a
guess
and
it's
really
a
guess
because
the
figures
are
divided
in
ways
that
don't
show
it
too
clearly
of
something
in
the
order
of
20.
now,
let
me
say
finally
on
this
point
that
there
is
no
statutory
bar
even
assuming
that
a
statutory
bar
to
this
sort
of
condition
attached
to
a
presidential
pardon
were
constitutionally
relevant.
the
very
statute
involved
here
under
the
uniform
military
code
specifically
authorizes
the
president
to
commute
a
sentence
to
such
lesser
punishment
as
he
sees
fit
leaving
him
a
full
sway,
full
of
discretion.
the
general
parole
statute
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
initially
had
a
provision
which
specifically
says
this
is
in
no
way
meant
to
control
or
fetter
the
discretion
of
the
president
when
exercising
its
constitutional
power
of
pardon.
now,
let
me
say
that
the
relevance
of
this
issue
is
important
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
mandatory
death
sentence
passes
constitutional
muster
because
in
that
event
it
will
indeed
be
important
to
recognize
in
the
president
a
power
to
commute
or
in
governors
of
states
the
power
to
commute
any
mandatory
death
sentence.
but
in
at
least
the
most
shocking
cases,
once
cannot
expect
that
a
power
of
clemency
to
be
exercised
if
the
alternative
use
here
is
unavailable.
and
yet
the
result
would
be
if
the
alternative
were
available
to
encourage
the
commutation
of
death
sentences
when
the
chief
executive,
whether
the
united
states
service
is
in
a
position
to
assure
that
there
will
be
no
automatic
eligibility
for
parole
in
15
years,
which
does
not
deprive
him
of
a
later
opportunity
or
of
his
successor
of
an
opportunity
to
reconsider
the
matter
at
a
later
time
nor
indeed
does
it
in
this
case.
now,
leaving
that
question
and
turning
to
furman
versus
georgia.
it
is
said
that
furman
versus
georgia
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
fully
retroactive.
and
it
is
true
that
in
two
cases
in
michigan
versus
payne
and
in
robinson
versus
neil,
this
court
so
characterized
its
prior
holdings
with
respect
to
furman
and
georgia.
i
don't
want
to
quibble
that
terminology
but
it
is
at
least
arguable
that
all
the
court
has
ever
held
with
respect
to
furman
is
that
it
will
prevent
the
present
execution
of
any
death
sentence
no
matter
when
imposed.
the
court
has
not
had
occasion
to
hold
and
has
not
held
that
furman
versus
georgia
is
fully
retroactive
in
the
same
sense
as
it's
held
gideon
versus
wainwright
fully
retroactive.
for
instance,
i
don't
suppose
the
court
has
had
before
it
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
has
foreclosed
itself
from
ruling
if
a
criminal
at
the
prison
now
should
come
before
the
court
and
say,
"i
plead
guilty
out
of
fear
of
a
death
penalty
which
this
court
has
now
ruled
was
unconstitutional
and
therefore,
i
want
to
withdraw
my
plea
and
have
a
trial."
that
would
be
fully
retroactive
application
of
furman.
if
the
court
were
to
force
such
a
prisoner
a
reopening
of
his
conviction
on
a
plea
of
guilty
and
it's
not
an
unreal
hypothesis.
there
may
indeed
also
be
civil
consequences
that
flow
from
a
full
retroactive
application
of
furman.
(audio
abruptly
cut
00:35:34-00:35:40)i'm
not
sure
what
they
would
be.
well,
they
deal
with
life
insurance
policies
or
other
matters.
but
this
court
hasn't
left
that
question
open.
now,
let's
say
that
the
court
has
not
closed
the
door.
of
course,
this
is
not
to
indicate
how
you
don't
want
to
decide
it
now
that
the
question
may
be
presented.
we
analyze
it
this
way.
we
say
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
furman,
when
one
puts
together
the
opinions
of
the
members
of
the
court
who
constituted
majority.
it
seemed
to
turn
on
two
findings.
the
first
is
that
the
public
attitudes
of
today
with
strong
emphasis
on
the
very
recent
past
indicate
a
rejection
of
the
death
penalty
as
unnecessarily
cruel.
also,
the
experience
of
the
recent
past
in
the
civilian
context
in
the
united
states,
indicates
that
the
administration
of
a
death
penalty
has
been
so
random,
so
freakish,
so
discriminatory,
so
haphazard
that
it
is
unusual
and
cruel
to
impose
it
or
carry
it
out
today.
to
effectuate
those
policies,
it
is
not
necessarily
required
to
go
back
20
years
to
invalidate
a
death
sentence
which
has
already
been
commuted
14
years
ago
and
to
look
to
the
collateral
consequences
of
the
death
sentence.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
approach
followed
in
michigan
versus
payne
is
appropriate
here.
and
it's
true
that
in
michigan
versus
payne,
the
court
declined
to
make
any
retrospective
application.
eventhough,
all
that
was
at
stake
was
sentenced
just
as
here.
now
here
the
court
has
gone
somewhat
further,
it
has
said,
"we
will
require
resentencing
whether
it's
still
a
realistic
alternative."
but
it
need
not
necessarily
go
over
further
step
of
undoing
the
commutation
which
was
premised
on
a
death
sentence
which
was
imposed
at
a
time
when
this
court
might
not
have
found
imposition
freakish
or
contrary
to
prevalent
attitudes.
now
finally,
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
at
all
events,
furman
should
be
applied
in
military
context.
i
owe
the
court
an
apology
for
raising
this
issue
so
late
in
the
day.
part
of
the
explanation
is
that
in
the
district
court,
furman
had
not
yet
been
decided
when
the
case
is
in
the
district
court.
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
furman.
in
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeal,
my
friend
invoked
furman
only
by
analogy,
that
is
to
suggest
that
the
no-parole
condition
for
the
reasons
given
by
majority
in
furman
violated
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause.
an
argument
no
longer
pressed
here
nor
indeed
put
by
the
petition
of
certiorari
only
if
the
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeal
was
it
suggested
that
furman
had
any
direct
application
to
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
court
of
appeals.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
been
too
far
away,
it
was
just
meant.
now,
even
so
we
should
raise
the
point
in
our
brief
in
our
position
in
this
court.
we
were
slow
in
seeing
it.
it
is,
however,
it
seems
to
us
an
important
point
if
they
ought
not
be
decided
backhandedly
in
this
case.
my
opponent
spends
a
very
great
deal
of
time
in
his
reply
brief
proving
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
concept
applies
to
the
military.
without
quibbling,
this
court
has
indeed
never
held
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
constitution
applies
to
military,
there
are
four
votes
for
that
proposition
in
travis
versus
dallas
and
only
one
court
of
appeal
has
directly
so
held.
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
we
may
assume
that
article
55
of
the
code
enacts
the
same
standard
for
the
military
and
i'm
willing
to
treat
it
under
that
same
extent.
but
it
does
not
follow
that
what
is
cruel
and
unusual
in
this
civilian
context
is
ipso
facto
cruel
and
unusual
in
the
military
system.
cruelty
is
relative,
war
is
cruel
and
the
reasons
underlying
this
court's
decision
in
furman
for
finding
the
death
penalty
cruel
and
unusual
mainly
not
be
applicable
in
the
military
context.
there
may
be
a
special
need
for
deterrent
in
military
conditions
and
there,
it
may
be
more
important
to
look
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
in
the
area
on
the
battlefield
which
may
have
a
very
real
deterrent
whatever
happens
on
review.
on
the
other
hand,
the
freakish
and
haphazard
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
which
persuaded
this
court
to
hold
such
discretionary
penalties
unconstitutional
in
civilian
context
is
not
so
likely
in
the
military.
if
only
because
there
are
so
many
levels
of
review
of
sentence,
something
unknown
to
the
civil
system.
first
of
all,
the
convening
authority
must
make
a
decision
when
referring
a
case
whether
to
refer
it
as
a
capital
case
or
not,
a
first
screen.
if
the
court-martial
having
had
the
case
referred
to
it
as
capital
sentences
the
prisoner
to
the
death
penalty,
it
must
be
approved
by
the
convening
authority.
after
that
the
case
goes
to
the
court
of
military
review
which
has
a
gained
power
to
reduce
so
vary
--
to
commute
the
death
sentence.
then,
the
case
goes
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
has
no
power
to
vary
the
sentence
but
reviews
to
conviction
in
line
of
death
sentence.
but
finally,
in
every
death
sentence
case
at
a
single
level,
the
level
of
the
president,
we
have
a
review
of
the
death
sentences
imposed.
so,
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
with
a
centralized
system
and
these
levels
of
review,
we're
going
to
come
out
with
a
patent
that
is
less
freakish
to
use
mr.
justice
stewart's
terminology
than
we
find
in
so
many
disparate
jurisdictions
all
over
the
country
and
indeed
in
the
federal
civilian
system.
mr.
louis

mr.

were

--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
speak
from
closer
experience
than
i
do.
i
do
know
from
what
few
figures
we
have,
that
there
were
indeed
several
imposed
then
only
one
carried
out
for
desertion.
there
were
many
for
other
crimes,
now,
i
must
say,
the
other
crimes
mostly
rape
than
murder.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne

one
doesn't
know
whether
that
was

or
not,
it
could
have

but
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
court
has
a
basis
on
which
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
furman
or
to
apply
to
military.
i
am
suggesting
that
they're
all
sufficient
differences
so
that
the
court
order
hold
its
hand
and
if
it
reaches
that
issue
which
it
reaches
only
if
it
first
holds
that
furman
would
if
--
would
retroactively
apply
to
the
situation.
then,
you
have
to
decide
whether
it
applies
to
the
military
at
all.
in
that
event,
we
think
the
record
far
too
bear
the
facts,
figures
or
other
indications
as
to
the
deterrent
value,
as
to
the
actual
experience
are
not
explored
in
this
record.
and
the
court
ought
had
more
to
go
on
before
reaching
that
very
important
step.
accordingly,
should
the
court
go
so
far
in
the
case
within
the
appropriate
cause
would
have
to
be
a
remand
to
the
district
court
with
an
opportunity
for
presentation
of
evidence
and
of
statistics
which
would
furnish
that
court,
the
court
of
appeal
and
have
ultimately
this
court
with
a
concrete
record
on
which
to
make
that
important
decision.
now,
we've
recognized
that
this
is
a
hard
case.
we
do
want
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
president
once
imposes
this
sort
of
condition
that's
so
irrevocably.
it
is
as
attorney
general
brownell
made
clear
in
his
advice
to
president
eisenhower
open
to
that
president
to
any
of
the
successes
to
vary
the
condition
and
it
will
be
that
the
circumstances
would
justify
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
is
open
to
the
prisoner.
perhaps,
especially
so
in
the
military
context
in
which
the
president
serves
also
as
commander-in-chief
to
appeal
to
him
and
perhaps
that
procedure
in
the
military
doesn't
require
going
through
the
pardon
court,
i
really
can't
speak
too
authoritatively
about
that.
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
frankly
was
unaware.
he
tells
--
i
think
he
said
1968.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
--
i'm
not
for
a
moment
suggesting
that
i
have
any
basis
on
which
to
encourage
the
hope
that
such
an
application
would
be
successful.
on
the
other
hand,
six
years
had
been
gone
by.
there's
no
reason
not
to
reapply.
