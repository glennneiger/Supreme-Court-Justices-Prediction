mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
whether
the
petitioner
can
ever
be
considered
for
parole.
the
relief
we
seek
is
not
his
release
from
prison,
only
that
he'll
be
given
the
opportunity
to
come
before
the
parole
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
were
simple
and
undisputed.
maurice
schick,
a
man
of
some
52
years
of
age,
has
been
incarcerated
just
under
21
years.
the
terms
of
his
present
sentence
require
that
he
remain
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
no
possibility
of
parole
release.
in
march
1954,
he
was
tried
by
an
army
general
court-martial
convened
just
outside
tokyo,
japan
for
the
murder
of
the
daughter
of
an
army
colonel
assigned
to
that
post.
following
a
six-day
trial
at
which
the
sole
disputed
issue
was
the
legal
sanity
of
the
accused
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
petitioner
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
although,
at
various
times
during
the
course
of
the
trial
and
appellate
proceedings,
eight
prominent
civilian
psychiatrists
concluded
that
he
lacked
direct
the
requisite
mental
responsibility
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
his
conviction
and
sentence
were
nonetheless
approved
by
all
military
appellate
reviewing
authorities.
and
in
1957,
his
case
was
forwarded
as
it's
required
by
statute
to
the
president
for
his
review.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
four
army
psychiatrists
testified
that
he
did
not
lack
the
requisite
mental
responsibility
at
the
time
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
at
the
time
of
trial,
there
were
two
civilian
japanese
psychiatrists.
he
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
return
to
the
united
states
during
the
course
of
the
appellate
proceedings.
opinions
were
submitted
by
dr.
karl
menninger,
three
other
psychiatrists
from
the
menninger
clinic,
the
psychiatrist
to
saint
elizabeth's,
the
psychiatrist
for
the
baltimore
court
system.
all
of
the
civilian
psychiatrists
prepond
that
he
lack
the
requisite
mental
responsibility.
in
1960,
the
president
commuted
petitioner
sentence
to
life
imprisonment
unconditioned
that
he
never
be
considered
for
parole.
at
issue
here
is
the
validity
of
that
"no-parole
provision."
we
maintain
that
it
is
constitutionally
invalid
on
two
separate
and
independently
dispositive
grounds.
first,
it
is
invalid
under
the
retrospective
application
of
furman
against
georgia.
and
second,
it
is
invalid
because
in
imposing
a
commuted
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole.
the
president
exceeded
his
constitutional
ground
of
authority
under
article
ii,
section
2.
i
should
like
first
to
discuss
the
furman
point
which
is
the
narrower
ground
for
decision
here.
petitioner
and
respondents
agree
on
a
number
of
factors
that
bear
on
the
furman
point.
there's
first
of
all
the
no
disagreement,
that
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole
could
not
have
been
a
judge
to
trial.
the
only
sentencing
options
for
the
court-martial
were
death
or
life
imprisonment
without
or
with
the
usual
parole
possibility.
second,
there
is
no
disagreement
about
the
inextricable
relationship
between
the
death
penalty
and
petitioner's
present,
"no-parole
life
sentence."
petitioner
could
never
have
become
subject
to
its
present
sentence,
had
he
not
first
been
sentenced
to
death.
third,
there
is
no
disagreement
that
furman
against
georgia
invalidated
the
imposition
and
as
well
as
the
carrying
out
of
the
dearth
penalty.
lower
courts
implementing
furman
have
vacated
death
sentence
isn't
substituted
alternative
punishments
provided
by
statute.
and
finally,
there
is
no
disagreement
here
that
furman
against
georgia
has
been
applied
retrospectively.
given
this
undisputed
facts,
the
"no-parole
provision"
of
petitioner
sentence
is
necessarily
invalid
for
it
could
not
now
exist
but
for
the
prior
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
had
the
death
penalty
never
been
imposed
petitioner
would
now
be
eligible
for
parole.
moreover,
if
the
court
were
to
uphold
the
petitioner's
present
sentence,
it
would
sanction
the
following
situation.
all
prisoners
sentenced
to
death
but
not
executed
at
the
time
of
furman
now
are
serving
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
with
eligibility
of
parole.
all,
except
the
petitioner
and
one
other
prisoner
whose
situation
is
identical.
schick,
who
is
singled
out
for
executive
clemency,
is
now
serving
a
more
severe
sentence
than
prisoners
who
have
been
sentenced
to
death
but
not
executed
and
not
singled
out
for
executive
clemency.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
presumably
he
could
petition
regularly
for
additional
executive
clemency.
a
petition
was
submitted,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
1968
and
denied
in
early
1969.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
he
certainly
was
not
executed.
we
don't
believe
that
the
government's
argument
draw
as
much
strength
from
the
fact
that
the
government
was
here
precluded
from
carrying
out
what
we
now
know
to
be
a
constitutionally
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
well,
the
government
has
raised
that
point
here.
the
answer
to
that
is
we
submit
clearly
that
it
is
constitutionally
cruel
and
unusual.
i
shall
address
that
in
some
detail
momentarily.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
warden
against
marrero
involved
primarily,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
a
statutory
question
about
parole
applicability
for
the
petitioner
there
and
the
effect
of
a
1970
statute
dealing
exclusively
with
drug
traffickers
and
whether
someone
who
was
ineligible
for
parole
under
prior
statute
was
--
should
be
considered
eligible
for
parole
subsequent
to
the
1970
statute.
the
question
we
present
here
or
that
is
involved
here
is
not
under
our
furman
point
of
statutory
question.
our
point
here
is
that
retrospective
application
of
the
constitutional
rule
of
furman
must
necessarily
invalidate
the
"no-parole
provision."
there
was
in
this
case,
no
statutory
basis
for
the
"no-parole
provision"
and
that
point,
i
shall
elaborate
on.
the
result
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner
is
serving
the
most
severe
sentence
of
anyone
in
the
federal
prison
system,
because
he
was
a
subject
of
executive
clemency
is
simply
a
pervasive
result.
the
result
--
this
result
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
purpose
and
the
spirit
of
executive
clemency
and
we
submit
under
furman
against
georgia
cannot
be
permitted
to
stand.
and
then
asking
the
court
to
invalidate
this
provision,
we're
asking
simply
that
it
rule
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
en
banc
ruled
when
it
was
faced
with
precisely
the
same
issue.
that
case
is
in
re
walker
and
is
discussed
in
our
brief.
in
responding
to
the
furman
point,
the
government
has
abandoned
some
arguments
that
are
earlier
advanced
including
i
might
note
the
argument
that
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
adopted
its
rationale
of
decision,
namely
that
death
sentence
was
never
imposed
in
petitioner's
case
because
it
had
never
been
ordered
executed.
now,
the
government's
primary
defense
to
the
furman
point
appears
to
rest
on
the
contention
raised
for
the
first
time
and
its
brief
under
merits
that
furman
against
georgia
does
not
apply
to
the
military
at
all.
this
contention
on
the
factual
assertions
that
rest
upon
are
wholly
unsupportable.
on
our
reply
brief,
we
have
cited
extensive
authority
which
contradicts
this
new
argument
and
i
shall
not
repeat
that
case
law
here.
let
me
say
only
in
summary
that
that
proposition
is
directly
contradicted
by
opinions
of
members
of
this
court
in
furman
against
georgia
itself
which
expressly
contemplate
applicability
to
the
military.
it
is
also
inconsistent
with
precedents
of
military
courts
and
civilian
courts
including
this
court
applying
the
eighth
amendment
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
to
the
military.
but
it
must
be
emphasized
that
the
proposition
that
the
government
puts
forward
here
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
entire
pattern
of
development
of
military
law
since
the
enactment
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
in
1950
because
that
pattern
of
growth
which
has
been
shaped
by
civilian
court
opinions,
military
court
opinions,
and
by
congressional
enactments
has
consistently
minimized
the
differences
between
military
and
civilian
criminal
procedures.
now,
the
government
offers
two
factual
justifications,
why
furman
should
not
apply
to
the
military.
it
should
first
be
observed
that
whether
or
not
these
are
true,
these
assertions
would
not
serve
to
override
contrary
bank
of
preston
cited
in
our
brief.
moreover,
by
seeking
a
factual
evaluation,
the
government
asks
this
court
to
open
the
door
to
jurisdiction
by
jurisdiction
review
of
the
applicability
of
the
furman
rationale
to
the
particular
experience
of
a
given
jurisdiction.
but
most
important,
the
factual
assertions
that
the
government
seeks
to
rest
its
argument
on
are
demonstrably
false.
the
government
argues
first
that
military
discipline
and
special
military
circumstances
require
the
use
of
the
death
penalty.
restated
this
argument
is
that
military
discipline
is
dependent
upon
capital
punishment
or
more
precisely
dependent
up
on
constitutionally
cruel
and
unusual
punishments.
this
is
simply
the
baseless.
the
short
answer
is
provided
by
the
military
itself
or
the
death
penalty
and
the
military
has
fallen
into
destitude.
it
is
simply
not
used.
when
it
has
been
used
by
the
military,
it
has
been
used
not
to
further
disciplinary
purposes
but
the
punish
servicemen
for
committing
civilian
type
offenses.
the
fact
that
the
united
states
marine
corps
has
gone
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
quarter
without
so
much
as
it
judging
the
death
penalty
at
trial
is
itself
conclusive
evidence
that
the
government's
claim
is
simply
unsupportable.
the
government
also
argues
that
the
military
appellate
structure
assures
that
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
military
will
not
be
random
or
discriminatory.
this
is
first
of
all
precisely
the
type
of
argument
that
this
court
refused
to
hear
in
the
petitions
for
rehearing
submitted
by
the
states
of
pennsylvania
and
georgia.
secondly,
this
is
demonstrably
untrue.
we
address
this
point
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
not
repeat
that.
let
me
say
only,
that
we
know
that
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
military
is
random
in
the
extremes.
we
know
that
it
is
used
so
and
frequently
that
it
cannot
possibly
serve
any
legislative
or
social
purpose.
we
know
that
it
is
discriminatory
among
the
services
for
it's
confined
almost
exclusively
to
the
army.
we
know
that
this
impact
is
racially
discriminatory
of
the
eight
servicemen
executed
since
1950,
whose
race
we
know,
all
were
black.
and
furthermore,
we
know
rather
dramatically
that
in
the
military,
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
does
not
necessarily
correlate
with
the
severity
of
the
crime.
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
it
be
asserted
with
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
military
is
less
discriminatory
or
less
random
or
less
irrational.
there
is
in
short
no
basis
whatever
for
the
factual
assertions.
the
government
puts
forward
and
on
the
basis
of
which
the
government
will
have
this
court
override
a
substantial
bank
of
contrary
precedence.
our
second
point,
in
the
broader
constitutional
point
is
that
imposing
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole.
the
president
exceeded
his
constitutional
ground
of
authority
under
article
ii,
section
2.
i
would
like
in
this
connection
to
begin
by
noting
what
is
not
in
dispute
on
this
point.
it
is
undisputed
first,
that
the
president
possesses
the
constitutional
power
to
commute
sentences.
it
is
secondly
undisputed
that
he
possess
is
absolute
discretion
in
deciding
when
to
exercise
that
constitutional
power.
but
it
is
also
undisputed
that
there
are
some
limits
to
that
constitutional
power.
there
are
admittedly
some
lesser
punishments
that
the
president
cannot
substitute
in
the
act
of
commutation.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
consent
or
the
acceptance
of
the
petitioner
was
not
requested
and
he,
of
course,
was
a
man
who
was
facing
execution
and
was
offered
some
form
of
executive
clemency
and
was
not
in
a
very
strong
bargaining
position.
the
narrow
issue
here
is
what
types
of
lesser
punishments
may
be
substituted
by
the
president.
what
are
the
limits
to
the
constitutional
power
to
commute
the
sentences?
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
well,
the
first
point
to
notice
that
a
30-year
sentence
would
never
come
before
the
president
in
the
course
of
ordinary
military
appellate
review
if
one's
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct.
death
sentences
and
cases
involving
flight
officers
go
before
the
president
as
the
ordinary
course.
but
if
the
particular
prisoner
military
or
civilian
petitioned
directly
from
the
penitentiary
for
executive
clemency
in
his
case,
the
president
certainly
would
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
hear
that
case.
whether
or
not
the
president
could
commute
to
a
punishment
of
20
years
without
possibility
of
parole
would
depend
on
whether
there
is
any
legislative
authority
for
that
punishment.
but
the
basic
point
is
that
the
president
may
not
make
up
any
punishment
that
he
chooses
to
substitute
as
a
lesser
punishment.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
we
certainly
would
say
that
he
could,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
well,
the
question,
the
rule
in
the
wells
case
and
biddle
against
perovich
which
require
--
the
rule
requires
that
there'd
be
some
legislative
basis
is
as
stated
in
those
cases
a
broad
rule.
that
requisite
legislative
basis
has
never
been
spelled
out
precisely
by
this
court.
presumably,
it
could
be
present
in
one
of
the
three
forms
if
the
commuted
punishment
were
an
alternative
punishment
for
the
particular
sense,
there
clearly
would
be
no
question
that
the
requisite
legislative
basis
was
present.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
there
is
none
in
this
case.
and
in
the
hypothetical
you
posit,
a
second
reading
of
the
legislative
basis
rule
in
wells
might
will
be
that
legislative
basis
exists
where
the
commuted
punishment
is
one
of
common
usage
found
throughout
the
code.
and
in
that
case,
confinement
certainly
is
the
most
common
punishment.
and
under
the
hypothetical
you
posit,
the
president
certainly
would
be
able
to
commute
in
that
situation
and
we
do
not
contend
otherwise
in
this
case.
this
rule
obviously
flows
from
the
basic
separation
of
powers
that
the
defining
of
criminal
punishments
is
a
uniquely
legislative
option,
that
a
ruling
by
this
court
to
the
president
need
not
look
to
legislatively
sanctioned
punishments,
would
confer
up
on
the
president,
the
authority
to
device
punishments
that
he
sees
fit.
now,
the
government
appears
not
to
take
serious
issue
with
the
general
proposition
that
there
must
be
some
legislative
basis
of
commuted
punishment.
indeed,
the
solicitor
general
in
biddle
against
perovich
argued
that
very
point
rather
the
area
of
primary
dispute
here,
this
whether
there
exists
the
requisite
legislative
basis.
we
maintain
that
no
such
basis
here
exists
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
the
commuted
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole
is
a
punishment
completely
foreign
under
military
law
and
foreign
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
not
only
as
it's
not
a
punishment
for
the
offense
of
which
petitioner
was
convicted
but
it
is
provided
nowhere
in
the
ucmj.
if
death
sentence
were
imposed
at
a
military
trial,
it
would
simply
be
an
illegal
sentence.
moreover,
that
punishment
was
nowhere
to
be
found
among
the
civilian
federal
criminal
statutes.
when
the
president
in
schick's
case
commuted
his
punishment,
he
could
point
to
no
statute
that
authorized
the
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole.
thus,
in
schick's
case
the
president
not
only
substituted
the
commuted
punishment
but
he
devised
it.
and
so
doing,
we
maintain
that
he
exercised
a
uniquely
legislative
function,
a
function
reserved
by
the
constitution
to
the
legislature.
so,
in
final
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
under
any
reading
of
the
rule
suggested
in
the
earlier
cases
wells
and
perovich
by
this
case,
the
president's
action
here
would
not
be
sustainable.
indeed,
when
one
looks
at
the
legislative
scheme
not
only
is
there
no
authorization
for
the
lesser
punishment
to
which
petitioner
sentence
was
commuted
but
the
legislative
scheme
reflects
a
direct
con
--
directly
contrary
policy
for
the
parole
statute
which
has
been
a
part
of
federal
law
since
1910.
it
reflects
a
congressional
commitment
to
offender
rehabilitation
as
a
matter
of
federal
correctional
policy.
i
would
like
to
conclude
reserving
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
well,
the
statute
that
issue
there,
mr.
blackmun,
i
think
the
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
right.
that
statute,
however,
did
not
exist
at
that
time
or
a
statue
authorizing
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole
did
not
exist
at
the
time
that
the
president
acted
in
schick's
case.
the
statutory
authority
that
the
government
has
cited
in
their
brief
as
justification
for
the
president's
action
here
was
not
enacted
until
1970.
there
was
in
1960
at
the
time
of
the
commutation,
no
legislative
authorization
for
that
punishment
and
it's
our
position
that
the
action
taken
by
the
president
without
any
legislative
basis
in
imposing
a
lesser
punishment
could
not
later
be
ratified
by
the
adoption
of
that
punishment.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
the
question
of
whether
the
president
--
of
what
punishments
the
president
could
commute
to
today
would
depend
upon
what
punishments
today
are
authorized
by
the
legislature.
to
hold
otherwise
is
to
allow
the
president
to
devise
himself
punishments
for
the
punishment
of
crimes.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
we
do
today
have
a
statute
which
imposes
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole.
now,
that
statute
it
should
be
noted
as
narrowly
confined.
it
is
combined
to
drug
traffickers
and
the
legislative
history
of
statutes
dealing
with
trafficking
and
drugs
indicates
that
the
congressional
intention
was
to
confine
those
no-parole
imprisonment
situations
to
that
narrow
category
of
crimes.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
no,
the
congressional
reports
there
stated
that
the
purposes
of
rehabilitation
in
the
context
of
drug
traffickers
could
be
carried
out
only
by
keeping
such
offenders
within
prisons,
that
the
parole
policy
was
uniquely
inapplicable
to
that
situation.
i
should
like
to
conclude
with
just
a
word
about
the
balance
of
interest
in
this
case.
on
the
one
side,
there
are
important
considerations
favoring
invalidation
of
the
no-parole
provision.
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
rules
at
stake,
a
no-parole
provision
in
this
case
is
directly
contrary
to
national
penal
and
correctional
policy.
the
no-parole
provision
is
anti-rehabilitative
in
the
extreme.
and
finally,
the
no-parole
provision
in
this
case
discriminates
against
the
petitioner
by
placing
him
in
a
special
uniquely
disadvantaged
category
where
he
is
serving
a
more
severe
sentence
than
anyone
else
in
the
federal
prison
system.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
no
countervailing
government
interests
here
at
stake
for
all
we
asked
in
this
case
is
that
petitioner
be
given
the
opportunity
to
be
considered
for
parole.
this
balance
or
imbalance
of
interest
here
are
the
strongly
we
suggest
for
invalidation
of
the
no-parole
provision.
i
just
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
only
two
brief
points
in
rebuttal.
the
first
is,
that
in
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
the
retroactivity
of
furman
does
not
reach
petitioner's
sentence,
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
create
a
new
strand
to
the
doctrine
of
retroactivity,
a
strand
that
would
hold
that
some
retroactive
constitutional
rulings
are
retroactive
for
some
purposes
but
not
for
others.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
right
and
that's
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
address.
respondent
suggest
the
appropriateness
of
a
remand
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case.
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
uniquely
inappropriate.
first,
whatever
facts
might
be
adduced
at
an
evidentiary
hearing,
they
would
not
suffice
to
overturn
the
contrary
precedents
in
military
and
civilian
courts.
but
moreover,
we
know
from
the
facts
before
this
court
now,
that
there
are
no
facts
that
could
be
adduced
that
would
justify
the
position
or
the
propositions
that
the
government
puts
forward.
let
me
deal
quite
briefly
in
the
specifics
of
the
use
of
the
death
penalty.
first,
the
idea
that
the
death
penalty
is
a
deterrent
must
necessarily
rest
upon
the
reasonable
expectation
that
that
penalty
will
be
used.
in
the
military,
there
is
no
basis
for
that
form
of
expectation
and
certainly
not
in
the
case
where
military
discipline
is
at
stake.
there
were
a
102
servicemen
executed
during
world
war
ii,
101
of
those
102
were
convicted
of
civilian
type
offenses,
rape
and
murder.
only
one
was
executed
for
having
committed
a
military
type
offense.
all
12
of
the
servicemen
executed
since
1950
committed
civilian
type
offenses.
but
even
if
you
accept
the
government's
hypothesis,
that
there
is
some
deterrent
value
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
without
it
as
ever
being
executed.
we
know
that
doesn't
sustain
their
position
here
because
the
marine
corps
is
not
even
adjudged
the
death
sentence
before
--
since
before
1849.
the
navy
has
adjudged
it
five
times
in
that
century
and
a
quarter.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
i
suppose,
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
same
way,
it
could
be
argued
that
the
more
random
and
the
more
freakish
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
is,
the
more
that
shows
that
the
deterrent
effect
is
created
by
the
death
penalty.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
we
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
102
were
executed
during
world
war
ii.
all
but
one
were
--
the
servicemen
who
had
been
convicted
of
murder
or
rape.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
do
not
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
my
figures--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
oh,
yes
indeed.
no
question
about
that.
thank
you.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
whether
the
petitioner
can
ever
be
considered
for
parole.
the
relief
we
seek
is
not
his
release
from
prison,
only
that
he'll
be
given
the
opportunity
to
come
before
the
parole
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
were
simple
and
undisputed.
maurice
schick,
a
man
of
some
52
years
of
age,
has
been
incarcerated
just
under
21
years.
the
terms
of
his
present
sentence
require
that
he
remain
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
no
possibility
of
parole
release.
in
march
1954,
he
was
tried
by
an
army
general
court-martial
convened
just
outside
tokyo,
japan
for
the
murder
of
the
daughter
of
an
army
colonel
assigned
to
that
post.
following
a
six-day
trial
at
which
the
sole
disputed
issue
was
the
legal
sanity
of
the
accused
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
petitioner
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
although,
at
various
times
during
the
course
of
the
trial
and
appellate
proceedings,
eight
prominent
civilian
psychiatrists
concluded
that
he
lacked
direct
the
requisite
mental
responsibility
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
his
conviction
and
sentence
were
nonetheless
approved
by
all
military
appellate
reviewing
authorities.
and
in
1957,
his
case
was
forwarded
as
it's
required
by
statute
to
the
president
for
his
review.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
four
army
psychiatrists
testified
that
he
did
not
lack
the
requisite
mental
responsibility
at
the
time
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
at
the
time
of
trial,
there
were
two
civilian
japanese
psychiatrists.
he
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
return
to
the
united
states
during
the
course
of
the
appellate
proceedings.
opinions
were
submitted
by
dr.
karl
menninger,
three
other
psychiatrists
from
the
menninger
clinic,
the
psychiatrist
to
saint
elizabeth's,
the
psychiatrist
for
the
baltimore
court
system.
all
of
the
civilian
psychiatrists
prepond
that
he
lack
the
requisite
mental
responsibility.
in
1960,
the
president
commuted
petitioner
sentence
to
life
imprisonment
unconditioned
that
he
never
be
considered
for
parole.
at
issue
here
is
the
validity
of
that
"no-parole
provision."
we
maintain
that
it
is
constitutionally
invalid
on
two
separate
and
independently
dispositive
grounds.
first,
it
is
invalid
under
the
retrospective
application
of
furman
against
georgia.
and
second,
it
is
invalid
because
in
imposing
a
commuted
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole.
the
president
exceeded
his
constitutional
ground
of
authority
under
article
ii,
section
2.
i
should
like
first
to
discuss
the
furman
point
which
is
the
narrower
ground
for
decision
here.
petitioner
and
respondents
agree
on
a
number
of
factors
that
bear
on
the
furman
point.
there's
first
of
all
the
no
disagreement,
that
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole
could
not
have
been
a
judge
to
trial.
the
only
sentencing
options
for
the
court-martial
were
death
or
life
imprisonment
without
or
with
the
usual
parole
possibility.
second,
there
is
no
disagreement
about
the
inextricable
relationship
between
the
death
penalty
and
petitioner's
present,
"no-parole
life
sentence."
petitioner
could
never
have
become
subject
to
its
present
sentence,
had
he
not
first
been
sentenced
to
death.
third,
there
is
no
disagreement
that
furman
against
georgia
invalidated
the
imposition
and
as
well
as
the
carrying
out
of
the
dearth
penalty.
lower
courts
implementing
furman
have
vacated
death
sentence
isn't
substituted
alternative
punishments
provided
by
statute.
and
finally,
there
is
no
disagreement
here
that
furman
against
georgia
has
been
applied
retrospectively.
given
this
undisputed
facts,
the
"no-parole
provision"
of
petitioner
sentence
is
necessarily
invalid
for
it
could
not
now
exist
but
for
the
prior
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
had
the
death
penalty
never
been
imposed
petitioner
would
now
be
eligible
for
parole.
moreover,
if
the
court
were
to
uphold
the
petitioner's
present
sentence,
it
would
sanction
the
following
situation.
all
prisoners
sentenced
to
death
but
not
executed
at
the
time
of
furman
now
are
serving
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
with
eligibility
of
parole.
all,
except
the
petitioner
and
one
other
prisoner
whose
situation
is
identical.
schick,
who
is
singled
out
for
executive
clemency,
is
now
serving
a
more
severe
sentence
than
prisoners
who
have
been
sentenced
to
death
but
not
executed
and
not
singled
out
for
executive
clemency.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
presumably
he
could
petition
regularly
for
additional
executive
clemency.
a
petition
was
submitted,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
1968
and
denied
in
early
1969.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
he
certainly
was
not
executed.
we
don't
believe
that
the
government's
argument
draw
as
much
strength
from
the
fact
that
the
government
was
here
precluded
from
carrying
out
what
we
now
know
to
be
a
constitutionally
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
well,
the
government
has
raised
that
point
here.
the
answer
to
that
is
we
submit
clearly
that
it
is
constitutionally
cruel
and
unusual.
i
shall
address
that
in
some
detail
momentarily.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
warden
against
marrero
involved
primarily,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
a
statutory
question
about
parole
applicability
for
the
petitioner
there
and
the
effect
of
a
1970
statute
dealing
exclusively
with
drug
traffickers
and
whether
someone
who
was
ineligible
for
parole
under
prior
statute
was
--
should
be
considered
eligible
for
parole
subsequent
to
the
1970
statute.
the
question
we
present
here
or
that
is
involved
here
is
not
under
our
furman
point
of
statutory
question.
our
point
here
is
that
retrospective
application
of
the
constitutional
rule
of
furman
must
necessarily
invalidate
the
"no-parole
provision."
there
was
in
this
case,
no
statutory
basis
for
the
"no-parole
provision"
and
that
point,
i
shall
elaborate
on.
the
result
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner
is
serving
the
most
severe
sentence
of
anyone
in
the
federal
prison
system,
because
he
was
a
subject
of
executive
clemency
is
simply
a
pervasive
result.
the
result
--
this
result
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
purpose
and
the
spirit
of
executive
clemency
and
we
submit
under
furman
against
georgia
cannot
be
permitted
to
stand.
and
then
asking
the
court
to
invalidate
this
provision,
we're
asking
simply
that
it
rule
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
en
banc
ruled
when
it
was
faced
with
precisely
the
same
issue.
that
case
is
in
re
walker
and
is
discussed
in
our
brief.
in
responding
to
the
furman
point,
the
government
has
abandoned
some
arguments
that
are
earlier
advanced
including
i
might
note
the
argument
that
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
adopted
its
rationale
of
decision,
namely
that
death
sentence
was
never
imposed
in
petitioner's
case
because
it
had
never
been
ordered
executed.
now,
the
government's
primary
defense
to
the
furman
point
appears
to
rest
on
the
contention
raised
for
the
first
time
and
its
brief
under
merits
that
furman
against
georgia
does
not
apply
to
the
military
at
all.
this
contention
on
the
factual
assertions
that
rest
upon
are
wholly
unsupportable.
on
our
reply
brief,
we
have
cited
extensive
authority
which
contradicts
this
new
argument
and
i
shall
not
repeat
that
case
law
here.
let
me
say
only
in
summary
that
that
proposition
is
directly
contradicted
by
opinions
of
members
of
this
court
in
furman
against
georgia
itself
which
expressly
contemplate
applicability
to
the
military.
it
is
also
inconsistent
with
precedents
of
military
courts
and
civilian
courts
including
this
court
applying
the
eighth
amendment
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
to
the
military.
but
it
must
be
emphasized
that
the
proposition
that
the
government
puts
forward
here
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
entire
pattern
of
development
of
military
law
since
the
enactment
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
in
1950
because
that
pattern
of
growth
which
has
been
shaped
by
civilian
court
opinions,
military
court
opinions,
and
by
congressional
enactments
has
consistently
minimized
the
differences
between
military
and
civilian
criminal
procedures.
now,
the
government
offers
two
factual
justifications,
why
furman
should
not
apply
to
the
military.
it
should
first
be
observed
that
whether
or
not
these
are
true,
these
assertions
would
not
serve
to
override
contrary
bank
of
preston
cited
in
our
brief.
moreover,
by
seeking
a
factual
evaluation,
the
government
asks
this
court
to
open
the
door
to
jurisdiction
by
jurisdiction
review
of
the
applicability
of
the
furman
rationale
to
the
particular
experience
of
a
given
jurisdiction.
but
most
important,
the
factual
assertions
that
the
government
seeks
to
rest
its
argument
on
are
demonstrably
false.
the
government
argues
first
that
military
discipline
and
special
military
circumstances
require
the
use
of
the
death
penalty.
restated
this
argument
is
that
military
discipline
is
dependent
upon
capital
punishment
or
more
precisely
dependent
up
on
constitutionally
cruel
and
unusual
punishments.
this
is
simply
the
baseless.
the
short
answer
is
provided
by
the
military
itself
or
the
death
penalty
and
the
military
has
fallen
into
destitude.
it
is
simply
not
used.
when
it
has
been
used
by
the
military,
it
has
been
used
not
to
further
disciplinary
purposes
but
the
punish
servicemen
for
committing
civilian
type
offenses.
the
fact
that
the
united
states
marine
corps
has
gone
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
quarter
without
so
much
as
it
judging
the
death
penalty
at
trial
is
itself
conclusive
evidence
that
the
government's
claim
is
simply
unsupportable.
the
government
also
argues
that
the
military
appellate
structure
assures
that
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
military
will
not
be
random
or
discriminatory.
this
is
first
of
all
precisely
the
type
of
argument
that
this
court
refused
to
hear
in
the
petitions
for
rehearing
submitted
by
the
states
of
pennsylvania
and
georgia.
secondly,
this
is
demonstrably
untrue.
we
address
this
point
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
not
repeat
that.
let
me
say
only,
that
we
know
that
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
military
is
random
in
the
extremes.
we
know
that
it
is
used
so
and
frequently
that
it
cannot
possibly
serve
any
legislative
or
social
purpose.
we
know
that
it
is
discriminatory
among
the
services
for
it's
confined
almost
exclusively
to
the
army.
we
know
that
this
impact
is
racially
discriminatory
of
the
eight
servicemen
executed
since
1950,
whose
race
we
know,
all
were
black.
and
furthermore,
we
know
rather
dramatically
that
in
the
military,
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
does
not
necessarily
correlate
with
the
severity
of
the
crime.
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
it
be
asserted
with
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
military
is
less
discriminatory
or
less
random
or
less
irrational.
there
is
in
short
no
basis
whatever
for
the
factual
assertions.
the
government
puts
forward
and
on
the
basis
of
which
the
government
will
have
this
court
override
a
substantial
bank
of
contrary
precedence.
our
second
point,
in
the
broader
constitutional
point
is
that
imposing
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole.
the
president
exceeded
his
constitutional
ground
of
authority
under
article
ii,
section
2.
i
would
like
in
this
connection
to
begin
by
noting
what
is
not
in
dispute
on
this
point.
it
is
undisputed
first,
that
the
president
possesses
the
constitutional
power
to
commute
sentences.
it
is
secondly
undisputed
that
he
possess
is
absolute
discretion
in
deciding
when
to
exercise
that
constitutional
power.
but
it
is
also
undisputed
that
there
are
some
limits
to
that
constitutional
power.
there
are
admittedly
some
lesser
punishments
that
the
president
cannot
substitute
in
the
act
of
commutation.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
consent
or
the
acceptance
of
the
petitioner
was
not
requested
and
he,
of
course,
was
a
man
who
was
facing
execution
and
was
offered
some
form
of
executive
clemency
and
was
not
in
a
very
strong
bargaining
position.
the
narrow
issue
here
is
what
types
of
lesser
punishments
may
be
substituted
by
the
president.
what
are
the
limits
to
the
constitutional
power
to
commute
the
sentences?
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
well,
the
first
point
to
notice
that
a
30-year
sentence
would
never
come
before
the
president
in
the
course
of
ordinary
military
appellate
review
if
one's
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct.
death
sentences
and
cases
involving
flight
officers
go
before
the
president
as
the
ordinary
course.
but
if
the
particular
prisoner
military
or
civilian
petitioned
directly
from
the
penitentiary
for
executive
clemency
in
his
case,
the
president
certainly
would
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
hear
that
case.
whether
or
not
the
president
could
commute
to
a
punishment
of
20
years
without
possibility
of
parole
would
depend
on
whether
there
is
any
legislative
authority
for
that
punishment.
but
the
basic
point
is
that
the
president
may
not
make
up
any
punishment
that
he
chooses
to
substitute
as
a
lesser
punishment.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
we
certainly
would
say
that
he
could,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
well,
the
question,
the
rule
in
the
wells
case
and
biddle
against
perovich
which
require
--
the
rule
requires
that
there'd
be
some
legislative
basis
is
as
stated
in
those
cases
a
broad
rule.
that
requisite
legislative
basis
has
never
been
spelled
out
precisely
by
this
court.
presumably,
it
could
be
present
in
one
of
the
three
forms
if
the
commuted
punishment
were
an
alternative
punishment
for
the
particular
sense,
there
clearly
would
be
no
question
that
the
requisite
legislative
basis
was
present.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
there
is
none
in
this
case.
and
in
the
hypothetical
you
posit,
a
second
reading
of
the
legislative
basis
rule
in
wells
might
will
be
that
legislative
basis
exists
where
the
commuted
punishment
is
one
of
common
usage
found
throughout
the
code.
and
in
that
case,
confinement
certainly
is
the
most
common
punishment.
and
under
the
hypothetical
you
posit,
the
president
certainly
would
be
able
to
commute
in
that
situation
and
we
do
not
contend
otherwise
in
this
case.
this
rule
obviously
flows
from
the
basic
separation
of
powers
that
the
defining
of
criminal
punishments
is
a
uniquely
legislative
option,
that
a
ruling
by
this
court
to
the
president
need
not
look
to
legislatively
sanctioned
punishments,
would
confer
up
on
the
president,
the
authority
to
device
punishments
that
he
sees
fit.
now,
the
government
appears
not
to
take
serious
issue
with
the
general
proposition
that
there
must
be
some
legislative
basis
of
commuted
punishment.
indeed,
the
solicitor
general
in
biddle
against
perovich
argued
that
very
point
rather
the
area
of
primary
dispute
here,
this
whether
there
exists
the
requisite
legislative
basis.
we
maintain
that
no
such
basis
here
exists
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
the
commuted
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole
is
a
punishment
completely
foreign
under
military
law
and
foreign
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
not
only
as
it's
not
a
punishment
for
the
offense
of
which
petitioner
was
convicted
but
it
is
provided
nowhere
in
the
ucmj.
if
death
sentence
were
imposed
at
a
military
trial,
it
would
simply
be
an
illegal
sentence.
moreover,
that
punishment
was
nowhere
to
be
found
among
the
civilian
federal
criminal
statutes.
when
the
president
in
schick's
case
commuted
his
punishment,
he
could
point
to
no
statute
that
authorized
the
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole.
thus,
in
schick's
case
the
president
not
only
substituted
the
commuted
punishment
but
he
devised
it.
and
so
doing,
we
maintain
that
he
exercised
a
uniquely
legislative
function,
a
function
reserved
by
the
constitution
to
the
legislature.
so,
in
final
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
under
any
reading
of
the
rule
suggested
in
the
earlier
cases
wells
and
perovich
by
this
case,
the
president's
action
here
would
not
be
sustainable.
indeed,
when
one
looks
at
the
legislative
scheme
not
only
is
there
no
authorization
for
the
lesser
punishment
to
which
petitioner
sentence
was
commuted
but
the
legislative
scheme
reflects
a
direct
con
--
directly
contrary
policy
for
the
parole
statute
which
has
been
a
part
of
federal
law
since
1910.
it
reflects
a
congressional
commitment
to
offender
rehabilitation
as
a
matter
of
federal
correctional
policy.
i
would
like
to
conclude
reserving
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
well,
the
statute
that
issue
there,
mr.
blackmun,
i
think
the
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
right.
that
statute,
however,
did
not
exist
at
that
time
or
a
statue
authorizing
life
imprisonment
with
no
possibility
of
parole
did
not
exist
at
the
time
that
the
president
acted
in
schick's
case.
the
statutory
authority
that
the
government
has
cited
in
their
brief
as
justification
for
the
president's
action
here
was
not
enacted
until
1970.
there
was
in
1960
at
the
time
of
the
commutation,
no
legislative
authorization
for
that
punishment
and
it's
our
position
that
the
action
taken
by
the
president
without
any
legislative
basis
in
imposing
a
lesser
punishment
could
not
later
be
ratified
by
the
adoption
of
that
punishment.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
the
question
of
whether
the
president
--
of
what
punishments
the
president
could
commute
to
today
would
depend
upon
what
punishments
today
are
authorized
by
the
legislature.
to
hold
otherwise
is
to
allow
the
president
to
devise
himself
punishments
for
the
punishment
of
crimes.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
we
do
today
have
a
statute
which
imposes
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole.
now,
that
statute
it
should
be
noted
as
narrowly
confined.
it
is
combined
to
drug
traffickers
and
the
legislative
history
of
statutes
dealing
with
trafficking
and
drugs
indicates
that
the
congressional
intention
was
to
confine
those
no-parole
imprisonment
situations
to
that
narrow
category
of
crimes.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
no,
the
congressional
reports
there
stated
that
the
purposes
of
rehabilitation
in
the
context
of
drug
traffickers
could
be
carried
out
only
by
keeping
such
offenders
within
prisons,
that
the
parole
policy
was
uniquely
inapplicable
to
that
situation.
i
should
like
to
conclude
with
just
a
word
about
the
balance
of
interest
in
this
case.
on
the
one
side,
there
are
important
considerations
favoring
invalidation
of
the
no-parole
provision.
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
rules
at
stake,
a
no-parole
provision
in
this
case
is
directly
contrary
to
national
penal
and
correctional
policy.
the
no-parole
provision
is
anti-rehabilitative
in
the
extreme.
and
finally,
the
no-parole
provision
in
this
case
discriminates
against
the
petitioner
by
placing
him
in
a
special
uniquely
disadvantaged
category
where
he
is
serving
a
more
severe
sentence
than
anyone
else
in
the
federal
prison
system.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
no
countervailing
government
interests
here
at
stake
for
all
we
asked
in
this
case
is
that
petitioner
be
given
the
opportunity
to
be
considered
for
parole.
this
balance
or
imbalance
of
interest
here
are
the
strongly
we
suggest
for
invalidation
of
the
no-parole
provision.
i
just
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
only
two
brief
points
in
rebuttal.
the
first
is,
that
in
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
the
retroactivity
of
furman
does
not
reach
petitioner's
sentence,
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
create
a
new
strand
to
the
doctrine
of
retroactivity,
a
strand
that
would
hold
that
some
retroactive
constitutional
rulings
are
retroactive
for
some
purposes
but
not
for
others.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
right
and
that's
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
address.
respondent
suggest
the
appropriateness
of
a
remand
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case.
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
uniquely
inappropriate.
first,
whatever
facts
might
be
adduced
at
an
evidentiary
hearing,
they
would
not
suffice
to
overturn
the
contrary
precedents
in
military
and
civilian
courts.
but
moreover,
we
know
from
the
facts
before
this
court
now,
that
there
are
no
facts
that
could
be
adduced
that
would
justify
the
position
or
the
propositions
that
the
government
puts
forward.
let
me
deal
quite
briefly
in
the
specifics
of
the
use
of
the
death
penalty.
first,
the
idea
that
the
death
penalty
is
a
deterrent
must
necessarily
rest
upon
the
reasonable
expectation
that
that
penalty
will
be
used.
in
the
military,
there
is
no
basis
for
that
form
of
expectation
and
certainly
not
in
the
case
where
military
discipline
is
at
stake.
there
were
a
102
servicemen
executed
during
world
war
ii,
101
of
those
102
were
convicted
of
civilian
type
offenses,
rape
and
murder.
only
one
was
executed
for
having
committed
a
military
type
offense.
all
12
of
the
servicemen
executed
since
1950
committed
civilian
type
offenses.
but
even
if
you
accept
the
government's
hypothesis,
that
there
is
some
deterrent
value
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
without
it
as
ever
being
executed.
we
know
that
doesn't
sustain
their
position
here
because
the
marine
corps
is
not
even
adjudged
the
death
sentence
before
--
since
before
1849.
the
navy
has
adjudged
it
five
times
in
that
century
and
a
quarter.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
i
suppose,
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
same
way,
it
could
be
argued
that
the
more
random
and
the
more
freakish
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
is,
the
more
that
shows
that
the
deterrent
effect
is
created
by
the
death
penalty.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
we
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
102
were
executed
during
world
war
ii.
all
but
one
were
--
the
servicemen
who
had
been
convicted
of
murder
or
rape.
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
do
not
--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
my
figures--
mr.
homer
e.
moyer,
jr.
oh,
yes
indeed.
no
question
about
that.
thank
you.
