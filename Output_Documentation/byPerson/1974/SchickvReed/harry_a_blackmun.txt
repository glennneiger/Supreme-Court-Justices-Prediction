now
that
i've
interrupted
you,

i
looked
at
your
brief
and
your
reply
brief,
i
think
you
didn't
cite
warden
against
marrero
of
last
term.
thus
the
government
has
relied
upon
somewhere
in
your
argument,
would
you
touch
upon
that
and
let
us
have
the
benefit
of
your
comments,
when
do
you
get
to
it?

was
any
objection
made
