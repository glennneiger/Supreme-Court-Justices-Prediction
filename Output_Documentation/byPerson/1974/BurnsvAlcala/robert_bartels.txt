mr.
robert
bartels
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
turner
has
recognized
this
case
really
involves
purely
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
ultimately
the
question
comes
down
to
whether
an
unborn
child
is
a
dependent
child
within
the
meaning
of
title
iv
of
the
social
security
act
and
a
particular
section
406
(a).
now,
if
as
a
vast
majority
of
the
lower
courts
have
held
an
unborn
child
is
a
dependent
child
for
purposes
of
the
act.
then,
under
this
court's
prior
decision
the
states
must
make
needy
pregnant
women
eligible
for
afdc
assistance
with
respect
to
their
unborn
children.
on
the
other
hand
if
an
unborn
child
is
not
a
dependent
child
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
then
no
state
may
receive
federal
matching
funds
to
make
such
afdc
payments
because
if
an
unborn
child
is
not
a
dependent
child
there
simply
is
no
authority
in
the
social
security
act
for
the
secretary
of
hew
to
make
those
matching
payments.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct
your
honor
it
cannot
be
optional.
in
this
court,
hew
has
really
adopted
an
entirely
new
position
different
from
one
that
they
have
adopted
before
at
least
one
can
go
back
a
few
months
to
adams
versus
hecker
in
a
district
court
in
kentucky.
now,
the
position
of
hew
is
that
an
unborn
child
is
not
a
dependent
child
but
under
the
secretary's
rulemaking
power
under
42
u.s.c.
1302,
the
secretary
has
a
kind
of
general
legislative
power
to
create
whole
new
programs
as
long
as
he's
willing
to
say
that
in
some
way
the
new
assistance
is
related
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
as
drafted
by
congress.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor
that
varies
from
state
to
state
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
requires
the
states
to
pay
any
set
amount
of
assistance
to
anybody
and
certainly
within
the
confines
of
dandridge
versus
williams.
the
states
would
have
a
good
deal
of
discretion
in
terms
of
how
much
to
pay.
now,
in
california
for
example
a
woman
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor
in
some
states
an
unborn
child
is
regarded
as
identical
to
a
born
child
in
terms
of
the
man
of
assistance.
in
california
for
example
however,
a
woman
will
receive
a
smaller
amount
of
additional
assistance
with
regard
to
the
unborn
child
on
the
theory
that
the
amount
of
assistant
she
need
receives
for
her
needs
is
impart
allocated
to
the
child
and
so
that
there
can
be
some
reduction.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes,
your
honor
i
think
they
could.
this
court
held
in
dandridge
versus
williams
that
the
states
can
distinguish
if
they
want
to
between
the
first
five
children
and
the
six.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
in
terms
of
eligibility
for
some
afdc
assistance
the
states
may
not
distinguish
between
born
and
unborn
children.
but
when
it
comes
to
setting
the
level
of
benefits
in
the
standard
of
need
the
states
have
very
wide
discretion
under
this
court's
holdings
in
jefferson
and
dandridge.
so,
when
we're
talking
about
the
amount
of
assistance,
the
states
can
make
reasonable
distinctions
amongst
different
groups
of
individuals
in
the
afdc
program
to
reflect
that
they
have
different
needs.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor.
the
states
have
a
wide
latitude
and
that's
been
uniformly
recognized
by
this
court
in
terms
of
setting
need
standard.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
no
--
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
jefferson
against
hackney
again
says
that
the
states
have
this
wide
latitude
in
terms
of
distinguishing
amongst
various
groups
within
the
welfare
system
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
assistance
that's
paid
out
again.
where
the
federal
eligibility
standards
or
federal
standards
i
should
say
are
mandatory
is
when
they
deal
with
definitional
eligibility
under
section
406
(a)
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i
can
give
a
direct
answer
to
that
except
to
say
that
the
state
could
i
think
make
distinctions
between
now
$1.00
might
not
be
reasonable
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
assistance
it's
granted
and
some
of
the
material
in
addendum
c
to
the
respondent's
brief
indicates
that
in
terms
of
how
much
an
unborn
child
needs
by
way
of
additional
assistance
as
opposed
to
a
born
child
may
not
be
so
different.
so,
that
$1.00
might
to
be
unreasonable
and
just
be
question
for
this
court
as
to
whether
that
was
so
unreasonable
as
to
be
unconstitutional.
but
nothing
in
the
act
itself
would
prohibit
that,
no.
that
would
be
an
option
for
the
states
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
courts
to
decide
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
distinction
between
those.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor
that
would
really
be
a
constitutional
question
as
the
statute
simply
leaves
to
the
states.
mr.
robert
bartels
pardon?
mr.
robert
bartels
it's
not
what
it
says
direct
your
honor
but
that's
what
i
understand
to
be
the
traditional
standard
of
equal
protection
review.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor.
the
agency,
the
bureau
of
public
assistance
which
was
hew's
predecessor
decided
rather
early
on
that
administratively
the
best
point
at
which
to
determine
eligibility
for
an
unborn
child
was
when
conception
could
be
proven.
the
agency
could've
chosen
quickness
or
viability
or
something
like
that
but
administratively
that
would've
been
difficult
and
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
the
point
at
which
conception
at
least
can
be
proven
is
probably
the
most
logical
point
in
any
event
because
the
assistance
is
needed
at
that
point
in
order
to
avoid
the
likelihood
of
irreparable
mental
and
physical
damage
during
the
postnatal
period.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor
i'm
not
really
sure.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
i
guess
i
would
take
somewhat
stronger
position
that
either
the
quickness
i
guess
would
have
the
advantage
of
a
sort
of
tradition
in
terms
of
the
law
recognizing
certain
rights
in
children
when
they
become
quick.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that's
right
although
again
that
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
admittedly
ambiguous
and
there
was
room
to
interpret
those
terms
within
the
purposes
and
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
bartels
i'm
saying
admittedly
from
my
point
of
view,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
has
much
to
do
with
this
case.
the
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
again
interpreting
this
act
one
has
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
the
afdc
program
and
those
purposes
are
very,
very
different
from
the
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct
your
honor
and
--
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct
your
honor
although
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
distinction
there
are
at
least
a
couple
of
points.
one
is
in
--
for
one
thing
is
an
administrative
matter
congress
might
have
or
decided
with
regard
to
the
collection
of
taxes
that
administratively
it
was
better
to
wait
until
the
child
was
actually
born
and
to
avoid
the
situation
for
example
in
which
the
child
was
conceived
on
december
30th
and
then
the
family
will
get
a
tax
exemption
from
the
entire
year.
it
may
also
be
a
reflection
of
congress'
judgment
in
passing
that
code
that
the
additional
expenses
for
an
unborn
child
are
somewhat
less
than
those
for
born
child.
that
could
be
reflected
in
this
case
through
a
smaller
level
of
benefits
and
not
through
cutting
off
eligibility
all
together.
the
petitioners
take
the
view
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear
i
think
if
one
looks
at
it,
it
patently
is
not
clear.
and
i
suppose
the
strongest
evidence
for
that
at
this
stage
is
that
the
great
majority
of
federal
judges
who
have
passed
on
this
have
not
found
it
very
clear.
one
can
cite
dictionary
definitions
both
ways,
one
can
cite
shakespeare
as
oppose
to
other
colloquial
statements
going
either
way,
and
in
some,
they're
really
not
that
helpful
except
to
indicate
that
dependent
child
can
reasonably
be
interpreted
to
include
unborn
children.
and
it
then
becomes
necessary
to
look
at
the
statutory
purposes
and
at
longstanding
hew
interpretations
in
this
area.
and
that's
a
process
that
this
court
is
going
through
really
typically
in
welfare
cases
to
decide
questions
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
the
only
other
amicus
brief
that
i'm
very
familiar
with
by
hew
is
in
wilson
versus
weaver
i
had
a
little
bit
of
trouble
understanding
exactly
--
mr.
robert
bartels
that
was
in
the
district
court
--
northern
district
of
illinois
your
honor
and
that
brief
i
guess
was
also
adopted
by
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
parks
versus
harden.
now,
that
brief
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1302
and
hew
seems
to
be
taking
that
the
position
in
wilson
versus
weaver
that
the
term
“dependent
child”
is
not
clear
and
when
the
term
is
not
clear
in
subject
to
differing
interpretations
then
the
states
have
an
option
to
opt
out
of
the
broader
interpretation.
and
that's
an
argument
that
this
court
has
rejected
in
both
townsend
versus
swank
and
carleson
versus
remillard
and
i
suspect
that's
the
reason
that
hew
now
has
searched
around
for
some
other
arguable
source
of
authority.
1302
just
doesn't
work.
it
only
gives
the
secretary
the
right
to
make
rules
and
regulations
necessary
to
the
efficient
administration
of
the
act.
what
they're
trying
to
get
here
in
this
court
is
a
right
to
legislate
broadly
in
the
welfare
area
and
that's
something
that's
specifically
is
reserved
to
congress
in
section
1304
of
42
u.s.c.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct,
your
honor
if
an
unborn
child
is
not
a
dependent
child
within
the
terms
of
the
act
there
are
simply
no
authority
on
that
that
act
to
make
payments
with
regard
unborn
children.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
past
that
the
paramount
purpose
of
afdc
is
the
protection
of
dependent
children
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
congress
was
not
interested
simply
in
children
as
children
but
also
in
fostering
their
development
in
the
independent
and
productive
citizens.
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
clear
that
there's
a
crucial
relationship
between
prenatal
welfare
and
postnatal
development
in
giving
that
relationship
it's
at
least
doesn't
make
very
much
sense
for
congress
to
limit
assistance
to
the
postnatal
period.
because
unless
adequate
prenatal
assistance
is
granted.
the
postnatal
assistance
is
very
often
going
to
be
simply
too
little
too
late.
they're
not
even
going
to
be
able
to
repair
the
damage
no
matter
how
much
assistance
is
granted
postnatally.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
the
only
other
program
it
specifically
aims
at
that
is
title
v
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
title
v
is
significant
and
that
it
shows
that
congress
was
aware
that
prenatal
care
was
necessary
but
--
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor
two
things
about
that.
first
of
all
in
terms
of
the
clarity
of
the
language,
title
v
doesn't
talk
about
unborn
children
it
talks
about
mothers
and
children
and
that
act
was
very
early
on
and
has
always
been
interpreted
to
include
prenatal
care.
moreover,
title
v
is
restricted
to
certain
health
services,
it
does
not
extend
to
every
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
and
it
provides
certain
kinds
of
nutritional
advice
for
example.
but
it
provides
no
funds
to
follow
the
nutritional
advice
for
example.
now,
title
v
covers
born
children
as
well
as
unborn
children
and
so
does
title
iv
and
as
the
first
circuit
recognized
in
carver
versus
hooker.
it's
a
little
in
congress
to
suppose
that
congress
gave
both
to
born
children
and
limited
unborn
children
to
just
the
title
v
assistance.
so,
i
think
title
v
of
anything
is
further
evidence
of
a
congressional
purpose
to
include
unborn
children.
now,
that
congressional
purpose
i
think
becomes
more
clear
in
1950
than
it
really
was
in
1935.
and
one
thing
that
has
not
really
clear
from
the
briefs
in
this
case
is
that
as
of
1935
to
interpret
dependent
child
to
include
unborn
children
only
meant
that
the
states
were
free
to
provide
assistance
with
respect
to
unborn
children
if
they
so
desired.
it
was
optional
then
and
that
was
because
the
entire
program
was
optional.
the
section
406
(a)
simply
defined
a
large
group
and
the
states
were
totally
free
in
terms
of
the
act
to
pick
and
choose
groups
with
in
that
eligible
group.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
needs
of
the
caretaker
relative
are
only
added
in
to
the
computation
in
1950
contemporaneously
with
the
other
statue
that
has
significance
here
and
that
is
what
is
now
section
402
(a)
(10)
of
the
act
which
states
that
payments
must
be
made
to
all
eligible
individuals.
mr.
robert
bartels
oh!
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so,
if
anything,
the
addition
of
the
caretaker
relative
in
1950
shows
some
further
indication
of
congress'
awareness
that
the
needs
of
the
mother
have
to
be
met
in
order
that
the
needs
of
the
child
have
to
be
met
which
applies
i
suppose
with
particular
force
to
the
unborn
child.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
special
significance
about
that.
now,
the
addition
of
402
(a)
(10)
as
this
court
has
held
in
king,
in
townsend,
in
carleson
changed
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
federal
standards
markedly.
it
required
now
that
within
this
large
group
of
eligible
individuals
that
the
states
had
to
pay
to
everybody
who
was
eligible.
now,
in
1946,
the
bureau
of
public
assistance
had
officially
promulgated
in
the
handbook
of
public
assistance
administration
a
regulation
which
included
unborn
children
in
the
eligible
group.
and
the
history
of
that
regulation
and
its
very
terms
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
that
was
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
section
406
(a)
and
that
the
agency
was
signing
for
purposes
of
this
act
that
unborn
child
is
a
dependent
child.
and
if
hew
was
implying
in
its
brief
and
i
couldn't
quite
tell
that
the
agency
has
never
interpreted
dependent
child
in
that
way,
that
simply
ignores
this
entire
history.
now,
what
one
has
then
is
in
1950
when
the
mandatory
eligibility
provisions
are
enacted,
the
agency
entrusted
with
administration
of
the
act
has
for
several
years.
in
fact,
earlier
than
1946
declared
that
unborn
children
are
within
that
eligible
group
that
congress
now
says
must
be
given
assistance
by
the
states.
and
that
interpretation
by
the
bureau
also
has
an
independent
significance
quite
apart
from
the
1950
social
security
amendments.
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
that
administrative
interpretation
of
statutory
terms
are
entitled
to
great
weight
at
least
when
they
are
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
now,
this
interpretation
of
dependent
child
to
include
unborn
children
began
at
least
as
early
as
1940
and
as
addendum
h
to
the
respondent's
brief
indicates.
in
fact,
this
was
a
problem
that
was
being
considered
really
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
social
security
act.
that
interpretation
then
was
made
roughly
contemporaneously
with
the
act.
it
is
an
interpretation
of
longstanding
in
the
sense
that
it
survived.
for
over
30
years,
it
survived
the
passage

and
the
only
reason
one
perhaps
can't
say
it
still
hasn't
survived
is
that
hew
now
has
come
in
and
disavowed
that
history.
i
think
when
one
looks
at
hew's
position,
its
so
tied
with
an
absurd
view
of
its
powers
under
1302
that
it's
not
entitle
to
any
weight.
moreover,
there's
really
no
reason
for
the
change
in
the
interpretation
by
hew
except
to
evade
the
consequences
of
this
court's
holdings
in
townsend
and
carleson
but
each
--
mr.
robert
bartels
that
was
the
first
sort
of
official
opinion,
your
honor.
they
were
in
fact
--
mr.
robert
bartels
pardon?
mr.
robert
bartels
it
was
under
consideration
much
earlier
than
that.
in
fact,
after
the
passage
of
the
social
security
act
in
1935
as
of
september
1st
of
1936
at
least
five
jurisdictions
in
the
united
states
already
were
paying
afdc.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes,
your
honor
that
that
was
the
ordered
exception
to
the
wisconsin
program
was
overruled
and
one
of
them
at
the
memoranda
there
indicates
that
although
they
weren't
going
to
make
a
formal
policy
that
the
wisconsin
decision
would
be
precedent
for
future
audits.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
bartels
they
seem
very
in
that
system
--
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct
your
honor
and
i
--
there
is
simply
is
no
authority
in
the
act
for
that
kind
of
an
optional
program.
mr.
robert
bartels
he
was
a
general
counsel
to
the
bureau
of
public
assistance
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
really
sure
at
this
point.
i
think
that
in
fact
between
the
two
memos
that
mr.
smith
changed
jobs
and
became
the
general
counsel.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes,
your
honor
there
was
a
child
welfare
bureau
i
think
and
he
may
have
been
general
counsel
to
them.
mr.
robert
bartels
the
lengthy
memorandum
your
honor
is
set
out
for
the
most
part
in
the
addendum
i
that
follows
immediately
in
memo
to
ruth
blakesley.
mr.
robert
bartels
right.
in
those
memos
is
that
very
careful
consideration
by
the
agency
of
the
purposes
and
the
language
of
the
statute
in
terms
of
this
question
interpretation.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
one
and
perhaps
two
points
raised
by
the
petitioners
because
i
think
they
may
create
some
confusion
on
this
case.
first,
the
petitioners
make
something
in
the
briefs
at
least
of
the
fact
that
there
are
alternative
assistance
programs
available
to
pregnant
women.
and
they
point
primarily
to
iowa
code
chapter
252
which
is
a
county
relief
program.
the
thing
the
petitioners
don't
point
out
is
that
that
program
is
totally
discretionary
on
a
county
by
county
basis
and
whether
any
assistance
at
all
has
given
and
if
so
how
much
depend
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
the
bureau
of
public
assistance
which
i
believe
was
a
division
of
the
social
security
board
at
that
time
--
mr.
robert
bartels
--
was
the
administrator
of
the
act.
whether
any
assistance
is
paid
out
under
this
county
program
is
totally
discretionary
with
individual
board
of
supervisors
and
a
hundred
counties
in
iowa.
and
in
fact,
the
assistance
that
is
typically
paid
out
is
not
at
all
adequate
or
equivalent.
indeed,
if
it
were
equivalent
it's
hard
to
see
why
the
state
of
iowa
would
be
here
because
if
they
could
get
federal
assistance
for
that
same
program
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
of
iowa
would
be
a
lot
better
off.
food
stamps
also
were
not
a
suitable
alternative.
it's
clear
that
congress
didn't
mean
that
to
be
an
alternative
because
they
made
afdc
recipients
automatically
eligible
for
food
stamp
benefits.
and
the
food
stamps
themselves
do
not
cover
adequately
that
the
needs
of
a
pregnant
woman
during
the
prenatal
period.
secondly,
i
want
to
come
back
and
emphasize
that
the
citations
of
cases
like
jefferson
versus
hackney
and
dandridge
versus
williams
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
this
case
is
only
involving
a
question
of
whether
pregnant
women
and
their
unborn
children
are
eligible
for
some
afdc
assistance
and
the
states
are
totally
free
to
reset
the
level
of
assistance
for
everybody
or
to
make
certain
kinds
of
reasonable
distinctions
with
in
that
act.
so,
only
a
question
of
eligibility
and
not
of
amount
of
assistance.
so,
when
you
talk
about
financial
strain
on
the
state
it
is
just
not
a
necessary
consequence
of
any
decision
in
this
case.
the
statutory
purpose
of
the
act,
the
1950
amendments
and
longstanding
hew
interpretations
all
make
it
clear
than
an
unborn
child
is
a
dependent
child
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
and
therefore
that
iowa
must
to
make
unborn
children
and
their
pregnant
mothers
eligible
for
assistance.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
states
could
make
rational
distinctions
among
these
groups
and
if
the
needs
of
college
students
were
rationally
arguably
less
than
others
then
there
could
be
a
distinction
made
between
the
two
groups.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes
your
honor.
there
are
no
restrictions
of
parent
in
a
social
security
act
in
terms
of
the
state's
ability
to
make
those
kinds
of
distinctions.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
right
your
honor
in
dandridge
versus
williams
that
the
children
who
were
born
into
the
family
that
already
has
10
children
are
eligible
and
that
assistance
must
be
paid
to
them
but
this
court
held
that
a
ratable
reduction
or
flat
grant
top
was
all
right
because
the
needs
of
the
11th
child
are
in
effect
less
because
of
the
economies
of
scale
within
the
family.
the
assistance
it's
already
being
received
by
the
other
children.
