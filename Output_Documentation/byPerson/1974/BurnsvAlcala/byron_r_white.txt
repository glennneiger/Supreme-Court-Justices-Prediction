justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
agree
when
the
wisdom
holding
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
because
statute
does
not
cover
fetuses
and
an
unborn
child?
wisdom
held
that
the
regulation
is
invalid,
did
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
the
government
says
as
i
read
them
that
the
option
was
not
based
upon
any
understanding
of
the
fetus
is
a
child
but
was
based
only
on
something
in
favor
of
needy
pregnant
women.
i
don't
follow
the
distinction
but
that's
what
they
make.
i
gather
the
second
circuit
thought
that
they
could
not
buy
that
reasoning
either
and
not
just
held
that
the
regulation
was
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
agrees
with
you
too
that
on
the
statute
the
fetus
is
not
a
child
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
nevertheless,
aid
can
be
given
as
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
care
about
the
letter
issue,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
care
is
that
iowa
shouldn't
be
force
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
--
that
maybe
but
is
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
issue
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
woman
can
be
said
to
be
“great
with
child”
that's
a
very
common
expression?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
possible
justification
would
viability
have
as
a
point
to
qualification?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fetus
as
a
child
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
just
as
much
so
prior
to
quickness
or
prior
to
viability
as
it
is
after,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
admittedly
does
your
opposition
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
professor
bartels,
you're
familiar
of
course
of
the
federal
income
tax
code?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
get
any
comfort
or
discomfort
from
the
fact
that
it
is
a
fact
that
a
dependency
exemption
has
never
been
allowed
for
a
“child”
prior
to
birth?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
that
is
so
because
you
don't
cite
it
but
[laughter]
on
the
other
hand
for
purposes
of
this
subtitle
i'm
reading
from
152
of
the
code
the
term
“dependent”
means
any
of
the
following
individuals:
(a)
a
son
or
daughter
of
the
taxpayer.
do
you
think
this
is
entirely
have
no
consequence
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
hew
in
some
other
cases
in
district
courts
had
taken
a
position
that
the
statute
included
the
fetus?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
court
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
you
would
agree
if
the
act
as
written
does
not
fair
the
interpretation
that
the
fetus
is
included
as
a
child,
then
that
the
regulation
is
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
may
of
1941
opinion,
is
that
the
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
that
even?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
that
even
had
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
know
whether
this
letter
advice
was
acted
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
any
idea
who
weighed
the
smith
was
in
1941?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
seems
to
be
address
to
the
assistant
general.
that's
the
opposite
of
general
counsel
to
department.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
(voice
overlap)
with
the
general
counsel
would've
provisions
with
bureau
said
within
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
letter
refers
to
an
earlier
lengthy
memorandum
that
he
wrote
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
1939?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
general
do
you
--
what
kind
of
money
you're
talking
about
in
terms,
say
iowa,
is
there
any
idea?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
sounds
primarily
for
(voice
overlap)
not
for
food
or
sustenance
but
just
for
prenatal
care.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
include
food,
rent
and
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
very
much
of
food
and
clothing
is
included?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
too
that
outside
to
the
city
of
washington
where
they
have
no
access
to
congressional
record.
we
nevertheless
resort
to
congressional
records
that
we
have
here
in
the
washington
in
interpreting
federal
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
mainly
if
he's
irrelevant
may
we
rely
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
usually
don't
print
things
in
appendix
to
agree
that
they
are
printed
in
an
appendix,
the
joint
appendix.
if
it's
in
the
record
and
you
think
it's
relevant,
it's
usually
printed
in
an
appendix?
