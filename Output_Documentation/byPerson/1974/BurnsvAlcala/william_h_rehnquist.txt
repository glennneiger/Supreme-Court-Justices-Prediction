justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
turner,
as
i
understand
your
opponent's
contention
is
that
if
it
could
be
allowed
even
as
an
option
it
must
be
under
that
statutory
grounds
and
therefore
it
would
be
mandatory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
disagree
with
the
hew
position
that
it
is
optional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
the
issue
here.
what
i
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
is
massachusetts
against
mellon
about
50
years
ago
we
decided
that
a
state
didn't
have
the
sort
of
interest
on
behalf
of
its
tax
payers
that
enable
that
the
challenge
or
regulation
of
the
federal
government
doesn't
prevent
you
obviously
from
expressing
your
opinion
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
there
be
some
difficulties
with
that
under
townsend
against
swank?
i
mean
if
an
unborn
child
is
a
child,
can
the
state
distinguish
between
unborn
children
and
born
children
for
purposes
of
the
amount
of
aid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
constitutional
holding
townsend
against
swank
rested
on
notions
of
eligibility
under
the
social
security
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
you
win
here
mr.
bartels,
can
the
state
of
iowa
then
say,
“well,
we
recognize
the
supreme
court's
decision
and
we're
going
to
allow
$50.00
a
month
for
each
child
in
sr
living
and
$1.00
a
month
for
each
child
that's
unborn.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bartels,
in
townsend
against
swank
and
this
is
something
that
you
were
asked
about
earlier
during
your
argument
it
was
held
that
college
students
were
required
to
be
included
yet
i
gather
as
eligible
--
yet
i
gathered
from
your
argument
that
indiana
in
that
case
would've
been
perfectly
free
to
say,
sure
they
are
included
then
everybody
else
is
going
to
get
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
and
college
student
are
going
to
get
$5.00
a
month
because
we
think
there's
a
rational
distinction
and
in
fact,
just
argue
the
same
thing
they
argued
here
and
were
turned
down
on
legislative
intent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
402
(a)
(10)
just
means
that
everyone
who's
eligible
has
got
to
get
something.
they
can
get
much
different
amounts
even
though
they
come
under
exactly
the
same
term
that
makes
them
eligible?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
disapprove
that
sort
of
practice
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
want
us
to
forbid
that
sort
of
practice,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
weren't
in
the
record
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
even
know
whether
they
are
authenticated
i
take
it.
