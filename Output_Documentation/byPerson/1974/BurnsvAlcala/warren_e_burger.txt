chief
justice

e.

we'll
hear
arguments
first
today
in
number
73-1708,
burns
against
alcala.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
obligation,
do
you
mean
legal
obligation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
stop
you
for
a
little
minute
here
mr.
attorney
general
to
this
option.
if
from
1940
or
1950
onward
and
currently
the
agency
considered
this
optional,
is
it
your
view
that
this
necessarily
means
that
they
did
not
read
it
as
required
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i'm
addressing
myself
to
is
the
argument
that
there
has
been
an
administrative
of
interpretation
that
this
is
a
rather
unique
form
of
administrative
interpretation
when
the
agency
said,
it
was
optional
by
which
i
take
it
then
it
was
up
to
the
states
to
do
it
whichever
way
they
wanted
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
necessarily
in
your
view
preclude
an
interpretation
by
the
agency
that
the
statute
required
it
if
they
said
it
was
optional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
of
many
interest
that
in
relation
to
this
that
the
court
has
held
that
a
fetus
and
embryo
is
not
a
legal
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bartels.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
that
the
existence
of
the
federal
contribution
requires
a
uniform
treatment
on
this
subject
throughout
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
this
kind
of
a
context
however
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
case
which
you
rely
on
specifically
other
than
dandridge
that
you
referred
to
which
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
internal
revenue
code
undertakes
at
least
to
give
--
to
take
into
account
that
there
are
some
expenses
in
rearing
children,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
welfare
system
does
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
pointed
out
there's
a
different
approach
in
the
general
revenue
code
and
the
social
security
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
programs
developed
by
congress
for
prenatal
care?m
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
certainly
suggests
that
they're
not
unaware
of
the
problem,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
being
aware
of
it
they
have
not
extended
it
in
this
act
except
by
implication
that
you're
arguing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
when
it
was
aid
to
children
as
distinguished
from
aid
to
families
but
the
payments
were
always
made
to
the
parents,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that,
do
you
read
much
significance
into
that
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
would
i
take
it
that
exception
was
a
judicial
opinion
that
was
based
on
a
reading
of
parental
when
it
turned
out
that
the
correct
reading
was
prenatal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
could
be
more
than
a
typographical
misapprehension
on
the
part
of
the
court,
would
it
not
to
confuse
those
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
