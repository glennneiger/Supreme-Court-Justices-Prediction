mr.
robert
l.
shevin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no
i
don't
your
honor
except
there's
one
case
that
indicated
that
in
georgia
i
think
that
it
might
mean
as
much
as
$6.8
million
in
that
state.
now,
i
have
never
tried
to
figure
this
out.
i
would
point
out
in
connection
with
the
title
v
that
the
government
there
has
--
the
congress
has
appropriated
$350
million
under
title
v
for
services,
for
reducing
infant
mortality
and
otherwise
promoting
health
of
mothers
and
children.
this
is
in
section
7
in
the
u.s.c.
and
for
services
for
locating
medical,
surgical
and
corrective
and
other
services
for
crippled
children
and
people
like
that.
now,
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
prenatal
care.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
that
i
don't
know
your
honor
and
i'm
not
familiar
enough.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
but
prenatal
care
could
also
include
medical
service
i
suppose.
but
$350
million
would
certainly
be
a
lot
of
money
to
spend
if
food
and
clothing
were
not
involved
here.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
but
perhaps
--
well,
i
again
repeat
that
when
title
v
specifically
speaks
to
matter
such
as
prenatal
care,
you
have
to
consider
it
seems
in
the
light
of
title
iv
which
does
not
mention
anything
about
prenatal.
now,
judge
hanson
did
in
his
opinion
in
alcala
make
it
little
slip
he
quoted
one
section
that
specifically
mentioned.
he
quoted
that
as
prenatal
what
it
said
was
parental
in
section
601
if
you
know.
now,
that
doesn't
show
up
in
his
opinion
that
it's
in
this
case
but
he
was
apparently
laboring
under
the
apprehension
that
601
specifically
provided
in
title
iv
for
prenatal
care.
and
he
emphasized
it
in
his
opinion
then
he
later
wrote
supplemental
opinions
before
it
was
printed
that
that
was
a
typographic
error.
if
it
was,
i
submit
why
did
he
stress
it?
now,
as
to
these
letters
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
what's
that,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
of
correcting
in
a
typographical
error?[laughter]
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
but
to
say
that
it
played
no
part
in
his
opinion
it
seemed
to
me
he
stressed
that
in
his
opinion
by
underscoring
it.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir,
but
the
statute
says
parental
and
not
prenatal
clearly
and
the
judge
recognized
that.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
can't
speculate
on
what
was
in
the
court's
mind
when
that
was
done.
but
one
more
point
if
i
may
--
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
just
a
minute.
these
letters
that
are
dated
june
1940
and
may
1940
for
the
most
part
that
pertained
to
an
audit
that
had
to
do
with
the
state
of
wisconsin's
granting
of
this,
there's
nothing
--
i
don't
think
they
were
in
evidence.
now,
maybe
they
were
and
i
suppose
the
court
is
going
to
consider
them.
i
don't
properly
consider
them
a
part
of
the
record.
but
they
don't
even
show
in
their
face
who
peter
cashes
is,
who
gertrude
gates,
the
chief
is
or
where
they're
from
or
who
the
people
are
that
they
are
addressed
to,
who
would
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record
your
honor.
i
think
these
matters
have
been
simply
added
and
thrown
in
to
the
plaintiff's
brief
in
this
case
since
this
case
and
i
don't
think
they're
properly
a
part
of
the
record
herein.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
think
you
should
properly
do
that
if
there's
a
question
about
the
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
if
they
are
relevant
maybe
but
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
don't
your
honor.
i
have
no
idea
about
that.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no
sir,
i
have
not.
not
for
that
extent
and
i
can't
see
that
but
your
honor
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
cannot
your
honor.
not
absolutely,
but
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
--
i
could
ask
counsel,
mr.
professor
bartels.
there's
nothing
on
the
face
of
them
to
indicate
what
they
are.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir
and
perhaps
the
court
will
consider.
i
don't
see
you
shouldn't
necessarily
consider.
they
obviously
are
letters
that
were
written
but
you
shouldn't
give
it
the
weight
that's
accorded
to
a
united
states
senator
on
the
floor
talking
about
things
like
from
birth
to
death
and
cradle
to
grave.
doesn't
reach
that
type
of
statute
and
there
were
six
years
that
went
by
before
these
letters
after
the
act
was
passed.
so,
in
a
certain
sense
there
was
an
administrative
decision
of
longstanding
prior
to
this
decision.
thank
you.
