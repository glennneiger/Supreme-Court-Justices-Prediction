mr.
richard
c.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
burns,
the
commissioner
of
the
department
of
social
services
of
the
state
of
iowa
against
linda
alcala,
jane
doe
and
joan
roe,
is
here
on
cert
from
the
eighth
circuit
which
upheld
the
decision
of
judge
hanson
in
the
southern
district
of
iowa
in
a
case
of
statutory
construction
of
the
social
welfare
act
that
an
unborn
child
or
a
mother
of
an
unborn
child
is
entitled
to
afdc,
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
it
involves
titles
iv
and
v
of
the
social
security
act
passed
by
the
74th
congress
in
1935.
title
iv
being
--
pertaining
to
adc
or
later
afdc
and
title
v
pertaining
to
maternal
and
child
health
care.
i
would
first
like
to
quote
to
the
court
part
of
the
relevant
statutes
602,
title
42
of
the
u.s.
code
section
602
(a)
(10)
which
says
that
aid
in
a
--
if
a
state
has
adc
and
of
course
a
states
does
not
have
to
have
a
program
as
i
understand
of
aid
to
the
dependent
children
but
all
including
iowa
do,
it
must
furnish
with
reasonable
promptness.
it
says
that
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
shall
be
furnished
with
reasonable
promptness
to
all
eligible
individuals.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
were
three
unmarried
pregnant
women
without
children
and
otherwise
qualified
for
adc.
they
have
no
employment.
they
were
without
any
savings.
they
made
application
for
afdc
for
their
unborn
children.
then
if
i
may
state
the
issues
which
i
think
are
present
here.
first,
the
question
is,
is
a
pregnant
woman
a
mother
before
her
child
is
born?
second,
is
she
prior
to
birth
a
parent
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
if
she
has
no
obligation
to
support
her
child
in
regard
to
diet,
nutrition
and
things
to
that
kind
--
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes,
sir.
a
legal
obligation
or
duty
if
she
has
none,
king
versus
smith
which
pertains
to
a
substitute
father
without
a
legal
obligation
and
still
another
decision
of
this
court
which
pertained
to
a
stepfather
who
had
not
adopted
his
child
and
was
held
to
have
no
legal
obligation
was
held
not
to
be
a
parent.
following
that
logic
and
been
perhaps
that
stretching
logic
to
extremes,
the
mother
is
not
a
parent
if
she
has
no
duty
to
support
the
fetus.
now,
judge
pell's
dissent
in
a
case
of
wilson
versus
weaver
which
i
believe
was
out
of
the
third
circuit
involving
cases
from
illinois
and
indiana
indicated
that
neither
a
parent,
neither
mother
or
father
is
a
parent
before
birth
and
that
even
the
real
father
has
no
duty
to
support
the
unborn
child
before
it's
born.
so,
one
of
the
questions
here
is
whether
perhaps
if
a
woman
has
a
right
to
abort
her
child
she
can
be
said
to
have
a
duty
to
support
her
fetus.
but
let's
assume
for
that
the
pregnant
woman
is
a
parent
before
birth,
are
the
woman
and
her
fetus
together
a
family?
i
submit
not.
not
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
meaning
of
that
word
and
it
is
families
which
are
to
be
furnished
this
aid
with
reasonable
promptness.
does
it
need
the
pregnant
woman
derive
a
right
to
adc
from
a
fetus
and
the
ultimate
question
then
here
before
us?
is
a
fetus
a
dependent
child?
now,
dependent
child
in
the
afdc
law
is
a
defined
term.
in
section
606
for
what
would
be
406
of
the
act
but
606
of
the
united
states
code
when
used
in
this
part
the
term
“dependent
child”
means
a
needy
child
one
who
has
been
deprived
of
parental
support
or
by
reason
of
the
death
continued
absence
from
the
home
or
physical
or
mental
incapacity
of
a
parent
and
who
is
living
with
his
father,
mother,
grandfather,
grandmother
and
a
whole
series
of
relatives.
in
other
words,
if
the
child
is
not
living
with
one
of
those
relatives
including
the
father
and
mother
in
a
residence
maintained
by
one
or
more
of
such
relatives
as
his
or
their
own
home.
then,
under
the
statutory
definition
enacted
by
congress
it
would
appear
that
it's
not
a
child.
now,
there's
a
far
cry
between
a
home
and
a
womb.
it
seems
to
me
and
unless
the
child
is
actually
in
the
home
according
to
all
intense
and
purpose
of
the
statute
it
would
appear
that
it's
not
a
child.
now,
in
1971
for
the
first
time
in
february
1971
and
i
believe
this
is
for
the
first
time
that
hew
or
any
social
--
federal
social
welfare
agency
actually
published
a
rule
which
made
it
optional
for
states
to
grant
payments
to
allow
payments
or
to
make
federal
--
“federal
financial
participation”
is
available
in
payments
with
respect
to
an
unborn
child
with
the
fact
--
when
the
fact
of
pregnancy
has
been
determined
by
medical
diagnosis.
that
i
contend
is
the
first
time
the
public
ever
really
realize
that.
the
first
time
it
was
really
published
for
general
circulation.
now,
there
is
some
evidence
herein
or
some
indication
in
the
briefs
that
in
that
adc
handbook
as
far
back
as
1946.
the
handbook
which
is
of
limited
circulation
given
only
to
local
agencies
but
from
the
federal
government
as
far
back
as
1946
they
recognized
the
states
optional
right
and
its
option
to
pay
adc
for
an
unborn
child.
and
it
appears
that
as
of
1971
according
to
the
alcala
case
some
18
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
made
afdc
available;
34
states
and
territories
and
jurisdictions
including
iowa
did
not
then
have
not
made
adc
available
to
an
unborn
child.
now,
immediately
in
the
92nd
congress
i
think
upon
learning
for
the
first
time
of
this
then
first
to
published
regulation
both
the
house
and
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
and
the
senate
finance
committee
introduced
committee
bills
to
make
it
clear
that
unborn
children
were
not
to
be
considered
entitled
to
adc
that
they
were
not
dependent
children.
they
were
to
be
excluded.
now,
much
as
made
of
the
fact
that
those
bills
did
not
pass
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
little
bit.
since
1972,
when
these
bills
did
not
pass,
all
of
these
cases
have
a
reason.
i
think
some
18
or
i
don't
know
how
many
courts.
lower
district
courts
have
decided
this
and
no
less
than
sixth
circuits
have
now
ruled
on
it
and
the
sixth
circuits
whole
of
five
out
six
that
an
unborn
child
or
fetus
is
entitled
to
welfare
payments
under
the
law.
the
one
exception
is
the
wisdom
with
the
case
of
wisdom
versus
norton
out
of
the
second
circuit
decided
in
october
1974.
that
case
had
and
considered
all
previous
cases
from
all
the
circuits
and
all
the
lower
courts
had
those
available.
since
then,
in
december,
the
fifth
circuit
has
also
decided
this
matter
but
this
again
in
favor
of
the
unborn
child
those
cases
rose
out
of
georgia
and
mississippi
in
parks
v.
harden.
now,
wisdom
in
october
had
the
benefit
of
the
fourth
circuits
holding
the
other
way
but
parks
did
not
have
wisdom.
no
plan
intended
but
parks
did
not
consider
the
circuit
court's
decision
in
wisdom
which
i
submit
is
extremely
well
reasoned.
so,
in
any
event
the
score
right
now
for
the
position
that
i
take
is
three
judges
in
wisdom
who
were
unanimous
that
the
fetus
is
not
a
child.
two
dissents
coming
from
wilson
versus
weaver
and
one
of
them
judge
pell
and
judge
haynsworth
in
parks
v.
harden
also
dissented.
and
then
of
course
there
were
three
district
court
judges
two
form
florida
and
one
from
georgia
who
wrote
opinions.
so,
a
total
of
eight
judges
have
taken
the
position
that
a
fetus
is
not
a
child
and
not
entitled
to
adc.
now,
what
is
the
basis
of
the
general
holding?
i
think
they
can
be
summed
up
into
about
five
different
categories.
the
case
is
holding
that
an
unborn
child
is
a
dependent
child.
first,
they
say
that
the
act
is
not
helpful
or
clear.
you
can't
help
from
reading
the
act.
of
course
i
disagree
as
i
will
tell
him
a
little
bit.
secondly,
that
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
one
case
said
that
the
legislative
history
is
opaque.
absolutely,
i
disagree;
i
think
there's
all
kinds
of
legislative
history
in
1935.
third,
they
say
that
the
hew
interpretations
of
longstanding
are
entitled
to
substantial
weight.
and
of
course
they
are
except
for
one
major
flaw
and
that
is
that
the
government
says
and
has
maintained
in
the
amicus
brief
has
been
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
that
hew
has
never
really
considered
that
the
statute
entitled
an
unborn
child
afdc.
they
have
allowed
this
is
an
optional
thing
but
beyond
what
they
themselves
considered
the
statute
allowed.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
true,
i
think
if
an
unborn
child
is
eligible
for
adc
that
it
must
be
allowed
and
it
is
mandatory
and
if
there
is
no
optional
borderline,
i
don't
agree
with
any
optional
standard
at
all.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir,
i
do.
i
agree
with
the
hew
position
that
they
never
have
agreed
that
the
statute.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
oh!
yes.
i
do
agree
that
the
regulation
is
invalid.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
put
a
regulation
in
violation
of
a
clear
case.
now,
these
cases
rely
on
the
triad
of
king,
townsend
and
remillard.
three
of
your
cases
which
say
that
you
can't
read
in;
you
got
to
--
you
can't
look
for
--
there
must
be
a
clear
indication
of
an
exclusion
from
the
class
of
those
eligible.
and
there
i
submit
that
one
doesn't
determine
if
an
exclusion
can
be
found
until
eligibility
has
been
established.
and
i
think
the
courts
below
have
seem
to
miss
that
point
and
this
court
indicated
that
in
fact
in
the
dublino
case
where
it
said,
“in
those
cases,
it
was
clear
that
state
law
excluded
people
from
afdc
benefits
from
the
social
security
act
expressly
provided
would
be
eligible.”
well,
for
example
in
townsend
that
was
the
case
where
the
college
student
was
held
to
be
able
to
have
adc
while
going
to
college.
the
access
he
can
he
can
in
very
clear
terms.
it's
expressed
in
there.
the
court
here
goes
on
to
say
the
court
found
no
room
either
in
the
ex
language
or
legislative
history
to
warrant
the
states
additional
eligibility
requirements.
hereby
contrast
the
act
allows
for
complementary
state
work
incentive
programs.
the
dublino
case
--
the
distinguishing
case
was
the
one
out
of
new
york
where
they
allowed,
they
said
that
the
win
program
did
not
preempt
the
state
work
program.
so,
i
respectfully
-
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
all
i
can
say
in
that
regard
is
your
honor
that
in
wisdom
they
found
and
they
cited
that
the
government's
briefs
and
here,
the
government
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
to
conclude
it.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
i
suppose
not.
it
doesn't
anymore
preclude
that
view
than
it
does
take
the
opposite
position.
i
rely
entirely
on
what
the
government
has
said
in
that
regard.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
that's
true,
the
government
does
say
that
it's
a
--
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir,
i
do
disagree
with
the
part
that
says
it's
optional
but
i
do
agree
with
the
government
that
the
hew
has
never
really
determined
that
the
statute
thought
but
the
statute
included
the
unborn.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
i
can't
--
i
agree
with
the
second
circuit.
i
can't
see
--
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir,
but
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that
that
can
be
done
and
they
can't
simply
--
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
no
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
i
care
in
the
sense
that
i
represent
the
taxpayers
of
iowa
and
they
pay
taxes
to
the
federal
government
and
there
is
no
allowance
for
this.
so,
in
that
respect
yes
i
do
care.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
perhaps
not
one
it's
really
boiled
down
to
it.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir.[laughter]
very
well
taken
your
honor.
now,
what
are
my
reasons
why
i
think
this
is
a
fallacious
reasoning.
i'd
like
to
dwell
on
that
a
minute.
first
of
all,
a
statute
is
to
be
construed
according
to
its
plain
meaning
in
the
common
understanding
are
meant.
there
are
virtually
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
cases
so
holding
that
cited
under
statutes
key
number
188.
i
blushed
to
even
mention
the
citation
and
not
every
statute
is
open
to
construction
as
a
matter
of
courts.
so,
you
don't
even
look
at
the
hew
rules
and
regulations
if
the
statute
is
clear.
those
are
fundamental
things.
you
don't
search
for
ambiguities
that
don't
exist.
ambiguities
that
may
be
imagined
by
an
acute
and
powerful
intellect
in
the
quiet
of
his
law
office
or
something
that
you
should
not
look
for,
and
i
think
that's
where
those
imagining
scheme
here
that
this
statute
is
unclear.
this
statute
is
very
clear.
the
pattern
of
it
is
clear
just
as
it
was
clear
in
king
when
it
construed
what
is
a
parent
and
whether
a
substitute
parent
is
a
parent.
and
they
said
that
it
wasn't.
in
king
they
looked
at
it
at
the
entire
statute
and
they
considered
various
sections
all
through
it
and
said
that
they
were
all
consistent
with
the
fact
that
a
parent
had
to
be
one
who
was
legally
obligated
to
support
this
trial.
judge
pell
--
in
our
brief,
we
mentioned
judge
pell's
decision
on
page
9
of
our
brief
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
a
good
many
various
sections
that
indicated
the
child
actually
had
to
be
living.
for
example
in
42
601
or
the
words
care
of
dependent
children
in
their
own
homes
and
now
there's
a
whole
list
to
these
in
there.
i'm
not
going
to
go
through
them
but
various
places
throughout
the
statute
cover
that.
and
wisdom
versus
norton
noted
that
a
child
when
you
refer
to
a
child
you're
not
ever
in
normal
parlance
talking
about
a
fetus
and
that
is
why
it's
modified
by
the
word
“unborn”
when
you
are
or
possibly
inventory
smear
which
means
in
the
womb.
child
born
--
a
child
that's
already
been
born
is
never
modified
by
a
term
like
post
partum
as
was
used
in
the
parks
case
the
most
recent
case.
you
don't
say
one
does
say,
“i
have
three
children”
but
rather
“i
have
two
children
and
one
on
the
way.”
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
true
but
that
doesn't
mean
i
don't
believe
that
the
child
in
the
ordinarily
parlance
and
i
think
that's
an
ordinary
language.
i've
heard
it
many
times
but
it
isn't
common
at
least
not
in
my
state
in
iowa.[laughter]
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
certainly
and
i
hope
i
have
time
here
to
get
to
that.
i
wanted
to
mention
though
that
there
is
a
legislative
history
and
it's
cited
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
9.
there's
talk
of
from
birth
to
death
from
cradle
to
grave
and
things
of
that
kind.
also,
finally
and
maybe
i
had
best
with
that
light
on
skip
to
this.
roe
v.
wade
held
that
a
child
or
fetus
is
not
a
person.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir.
so,
i
asked,
“how
can
it
be
held
on
the
one
hand
that
an
unborn
child
or
fetus
is
not
a
person
at
least
until
the
seventh
month
pregnancy
and
thus
has
no
constitutional
rights
even
the
right
to
life
but
that
on
the
other
as
it
was
held
in
parks
v.
harden
a
fetus
is
an
eligible
individual
in
title
to
welfare
afdc
under
a
mere
federal
statute
designed
to
protect
its
health.”
if
as
roe
v.
wade
holds
a
state
may
not
by
an
abortion
law
abridge
a
woman's
constitutional
right
to
privacy
in
her
decision
to
abort
her
fetus
how
can
the
federal
social
security
law
abridge
that
same
constitutional
right
to
privacy
for
health
purpose.
as
judge
haynsworth
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
parks
the
mother
of
a
fetus
may
in
consequence
draw
afdc
for
her
eligible
individual
and
then
abort
at
her
whim.
and
there
finally
there's
an
old
saying
somebody
once
said,
“to
be
alive
has
become
a
virtue
and
the
mere
ability
to
inflate
the
lungs
entitled
citizen
b
to
a
substantial
share
of
the
laborious
earnings
of
citizen
a.”
are
we
now
stan
--
are
we
extending
this
right
now
to
those
who
can't
inflate
their
lungs?
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
have
any.
thank
you.
