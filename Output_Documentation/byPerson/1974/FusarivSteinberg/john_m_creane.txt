mr.
john
m.
creane
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there
is
some
danger
in
this
case
of
a
danger
that
was
noted
by,
i
believe
was
justice
rehnquist
yesterday.
that
the
different
cases
being
argued
here
that
was
decided
by
the
district
court.
i
think
the
only
way
to
understand
this
case
is
to
go
through
the
record
and
check
my
statements
and
mr.
wasik's
against
what
the
court
found
below.
before
i
get
into
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
that
justice
stewart
raised
yesterday
concerning
the
rule
of
thumb
on
the
reasonable
work
effort.
you'll
find
that
at
page
20
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
district
court
opinion.
and
i'd
like
to
read
that
part
of
the
footnote
from
the
district
court
opinion.
the
district
court
said,
it
might
also
be
noted
that
the
record
discloses
some
uncertainty
about
the
standard
against
which
reasonableness
is
measured.
theodore
hatcher,
unemployment
compensation
director
for
connecticut
testified
that
there
is
an
informal
--
i'll
wait
until
you've
found
it,
i'm
sorry.
it's
on
the
footnote
25
on
page
20
(a).
mr.
john
m.
creane
20
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
hatcher
testified
that
there
was
a
rule
of
thumb
that
the
claimant
must
list
at
least
three
places
at
which
he
has
sought
employment
a
week
on
his
uc
45
form.
in
response
to
a
question
from
this
court,
mr.
hatcher
said
the
claimants
were
advised
to
this
rule
that
their
benefits,
rights
interviewed.
however,
eleanor
smarse,
manager
of
the
bridgeport
unemployment
compensation
office
responded
to
a
question
about
where
the
claimants
were
told
of
the
rule
of
thumb
by
stating
it
was
not
an
official
notification
that
they
were
to
tell
these
people
if
that
is
what
happened.
but
that
is,
there
is
no
official
number
or
anything
in
reference
to
this.
thus,
serious
questions
arise
about
whether
a
claimant
can
ever
meet
a
burden
of
proof
based
on
a
rule
of
thumb
that
he
has
never
heard
of.
indeed,
even
mr.
hatcher
conceded
that
in
crash
periods,
not
everyone
receives
a
benefit
rights
interview
at
which
the
information
is
supposedly
imparted.
the
actual
testimony
for
those
that
want
to
compare
the
context
of
that
from
mrs.
smarse
is
at
page
87
through
90
of
the
single
appendix
and
on
mr.
hatcher
pages
193
through
194
(a)
of
the
single
appendix.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
the
conflict
was
between
the
director,
mr.
hatcher
and
the
office
manager,
one
of
them
was
saying,
well
yes,
of
course
everyone
hears
about
it
and
the
person
who
administers
the
program
at
the
local
office
said
“no,
we
don't
tell
them
there's
no
magic
number.”
sometimes
three
is
enough,
maybe
it
isn't,
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
i
think
they
did.
thus
serious
questions
arise
though
whether
a
claimant
can
ever
meet
a
burden
of
prove
that
he's
never
heard
about.
i
think
that
clearly
resolves
it,
at
least
it
does
in
my
mind.
now
mr.
wasik
stated
yesterday
that
he
wasn't
sure
that
the
fact
finders,
all
of
the
fact
finders
knew
about
it.
these
are
the
people,
they
are
administering
the
program
and
he
wasn't
sure
if
they
had
heard
about
the
rule
thumb
but
that
he
was
pretty
sure
that
the
claimants
knew
about
it.
now,
i'm
not
sure
what
that
means
that
the
people
running
the
system
may
not
know
about
it
but
the
claimants
apparently
know
about
it.
there
is
just
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
a
finding
that
any
claimant
knew
about
this
rule
of
thumb
and
in
fact,
to
the
contrary,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
depositions
of
one
of
the
original
plaintiffs
who
mr.
wasik
did
not
mention
during
his
argument.
that
would
be
mrs.
trianna.
i
think
she
presents
a
fair
representation
of
what
can
happen
to
a
person
going
through
the
system.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
i
think
mr.
--
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
laid
down
what
he
feels
is
the
basic
issue
before
this
court,
is
it
a
fair
system?
and
that
i
intend
to
go
into
the
defects
found
by
the
district
court
in
the
seated
interview
procedure
and
demonstrate
a
hope
that
the
district
court
was
correct.
mr.
wasik
is
saying
they
were
wrong
and
the
rule
of
thumb
is
just
one
small
dose
of
the
type
of
fairness
that
many
claimants
encounter
in
the
unemployment
system
in
connecticut,
they're
not
told
about
it.
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
the
question
i
think
is,
how
can
a
claimant
satisfy
a
standard
which
he
doesn't
know
about?
mr.
john
m.
creane
the
standard
i
think
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
that's
on
page
258
of
the
appendix.
hereafter,
this
is
the
only
guidance
that
a
claimant
gets
on
the
issue
of
reasonable
effort.
your
efforts
to
get
a
job
must
be
the
efforts
which
a
person
out
of
work
would
make
if
he
is
sincerely
looking
for
work.
i
think
that
standard
and
maybe
the
best
that
could
be
managed
but
it's
devoid
of
any
kind
of
guidance
i
think
largely
for
claimant
and
at
least
some
(inaudible),
other
fact
finder
applying
whatever
standard
he
happens
to
feel
is
reasonable
for
that
claimant.
now
there
are
some
office
memos
that
are
also
set
out
in
the
appendix
that
spell
out
in
more
detail
what
reasonable
effort
it
is
and
as
mrs.
smarse
in
her
deposition
stated,
there
is
virtually
an
infinite
number
of
factors
that
can
be
taken
into
account
on
determining
reasonable
effort.
the
only
one
who
has
access
to
any
of
these
memos,
or
has
any
idea
of
what
standard
he
is
being
measured
against
is
the
fact
finder.
the
claimant
simply
goes
into
it
blind.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no
i
don't
think
that
would
be
practical
mr.
justice.
what
we're
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
that
may
be
what's
intended
but
it
still
comes
down
with
subjective
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
apparently
not.
it
comes
down
pretty
much
to
a
subjective
determination.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
it
depends
for
one
thing
the
department
has
recognized
that
the
unemployment
rate
in
the
area
is
one
of
the
factors
that
a
fact
finder
should
take
into
consideration
on
what
is
reasonable.
obviously
if
there
are
a
lot
of
jobs
available,
you're
expected
to
go
out
and
find
one
of
them
as
suppose
to
when
there
are
fewer
or
none,
the
department
is
recognized
that
there
is
little
point
in
making
a
person
run
around
fruitlessly.
and
yet,
again
in
the
deposition
of
mrs.
smarse,
she
said
that
she
has
never
--
as
far
as
she
knows,
they're
not
--
the
fact
finders
are
not
given
that
information
and
she's
never
seen
it
in
a
fact
finding
decision
and
yet
that's
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
factors
on
reasonable
effort.
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
think
that
is
reflected
in
department
memos
that
they
will
not
require
fruitless
chasing
around
when
there
simply
are
no
jobs
available.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
certainly.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes.
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
can
--
if
you
look
at
page
117
(a)
of
the
single
appendix
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
yes
mr.
justice.
it's
right
about
in
the
middle
of
paragraph
two
on
what
constitutes
reasonable
effort.
beginning
with
if
however,
there
is
very
little
hiring
taking
place
because
of
depressed
economic
activity
and
the
employment
service
has
most
of
the
existing
jobs
listed
in
its
files
than
a
less
complete
round
of
visits
to
possible
employers
as
indicated.
that's
one
of
the
factors
that
a
fact
finder
is
supposed
to
take
into
consideration.
apparently
they're
not
given
the
information
on
what
the
unemployment
rate
is,
that
was
in
the
deposition
of
the
office
manager.
mr.
john
m.
creane
oh
yes,
that's
--
i
mean
those
are
department
of
labor
statistics
that
are
available
by
region.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
it's
i
believe
monthly
information
which
is
not
passed
on
to
the
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
taking
into
consideration
on
making
a
determination.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
there
is
some
time
like
to
be
sure
but
that's
true
of
any
of
our
governmental
statistics,
it's
the
most
accurate
information
available.
mr.
john
m.
creane
what
we
are
seeking
in
this
case
is
exactly
what
the
state
of
connecticut
is
giving
to
other
claimants
in
more
or
less
the
same
circumstances.
in
fact,
where
there
is
less
compelling
reasons
for
a
hearing.
mr.
john
m.
creane
something
certainly
more
than
a
probable
cause
hearing
in
light
of
the
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
because
we
feel
that
there's
very
strong
presence
of
two
factors
that
i
believe
you
pointed
out
in
the
arnett
versus
kennedy
case.
there's
a
very
strong
individual
interest
in
the
deprivation
of
benefits
in
this
case
and
i'd
like
to
go
into
the
need
aspect
of
this
program.
and
secondly
as
the
risk
of
error
at
the
initial
determination
and
it's
a
very
substantial
risk
of
error
and
thirdly,
we're
not
talking
about
simple
mathematical
calculations
that
are
easily
solved
by
documentary
proof.
we're
talking
about
the
application
of
broad
fault
standards,
reasonable
effort.
mr.
john
m.
creane
on
a
probable
cause
hearing?
no,
even
the
present
procedures
would
not
constitute
a
probable
cause
hearing,
in
light
of
the
defects
that
were
noted
by
the
district
court.
i
think
at
a
minimum,
the
claimant
has
to
have
advanced
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
bring
witnesses
with
him.
now,
it's
undisputed
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
pardon?
mr.
john
m.
creane
what,
advanced
notice?
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
think
the
criminal
situation
was
not
analogous
to
a
man
or
may
be
his
only
source
of
income
being
taken
away
from
him.
i
think
it's
very
close
to
the
welfare
situation,
if
not
exactly
on
all
force.
although,
i
recognize
that
there
is
no
need
test
in
unemployment.
there's
no
requirement
that
you
demonstrate
need.
i
think
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
java
that
congress
intended
this
as
a
salary
replacement
during
the
worker's
period
of
unemployment.
and
i
think
it's
also
un-disputable
that
many
unemployment
claimants
are
living
very
close
to
the
edge
of
subsistence
and
it
isn't
very
difficult
to
see
why.
in
connecticut,
the
average
wage
several
years
ago
was
$150.00
a
week.
the
average
claimant
received
40%
of
that
average
income
which
comes
out
to
about
$60.00
a
week.
before
his
benefits
are
even
terminated,
his
back
may
already
be
to
the
wall.
he
may
already
be
in
a
position
where
he's
just
on
a
subsistence
income
there
without
talking
about
denying
any
additional
benefits.
now,
there
was
one
other
point,
mr.
justice
that
you
raised
about
a
week
to
week,
the
man
can
go
back
out
again
and
get
his
benefits.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
--
again
in
the
appendix,
to
the
affidavit
of
mrs.
triana.
that
would
be
at
page
135
(a).
i'm
not
going
to
read
the
entire
affidavit
but
the
gist
of
it
is,
this
is
what
happened
to
mrs.
triana.
she
had
been
collecting
for
two
to
four
weeks.
she
walked
in
to
the
unemployment
office
in
bridgeport
and
they
said,
you
haven't
filled
out
your
card
properly,
now
the
woman
doesn't
speak
english.
to
my
knowledge,
this
benefit
rights
booklet
is
not
even
reproduced
in
spanish
or
at
least
it
was
not
at
that
time.
they
said
no,
you
didn't
use
reasonable
effort,
fill
out
this
form
properly
next
time
you
come
back
in.
she
came
back
in
two
weeks
later
and
she
had
her
six
signatures
on
the
card.
she
hadn't
write
down
there
and
they
said
“well,
you
did
it
all
in
one
day,”
that
isn't
reasonable
effort
and
she
explained
to
them
that
her
son
who
acted
as
her
interpreter,
had
to
go
around
with
her
on
the
one
day
that
he
could,
off
again.
she
was
denied
six
consecutive
weeks,
finally
got
her
hearing
about
three
months
later
and
the
commissioner
found,
one
of
his
finding
is
the
fact
is
that
she
was
desperate
for
work.
she
sought
work
throughout
the
labor
market.
he
restored
for
those
six
weeks.
mr.
miranda,
another
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
denied
eight
consecutive
weeks
on
the
issue
of
reasonable
effort.
no,
the
first
two
or
four
were
unreasonable
effort,
the
next
four
they
denied
simply
because
he
had
an
appeal
pending.
it's
against
department
policy
but
it's
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
that
it
happens.
when
he
got
his
hearing,
the
commissioner
restored
all
eight
weeks
and
said
that
that
fact
finder
was
wrong
eight
times
in
a
row
on
the
issue
of
reasonable
effort.
so
i
think
that,
while
the
department
policy
is
that
it's
week
by
week,
very
often
that
is
not
the
impact
on
the
claimant.
mr.
john
m.
creane
what
type
of
notice?
well
i
think
on
the
--
there's
a
good
model
for
this
court,
for
the
district
court
to
follow
if
it's
affirmed
and
remanded
in
the
proposed
consent
order
that
the
state
has
filed
in
this
case.
i
think
this
is
important
for
the
court
to
take
note
of.
what
the
department
has
said
is
that
on
an
initial
--
on
a
redetermination
of
eligibility,
on
an
initial
disqualification,
they
now
recognize
that
due
process
requires
that
they
give
advance
notice,
right
to
bring
in
counsel,
right
to
present
evidence.
that's
what
we're
looking
for
and
they're
giving
it
in
situations
where
a
claimant,
they
feel
--
they
had
made
an
error
on
this
initial
wage
credits
and
they
--
it's
a
simple
mathematical
calculation
and
yet
they
recognized
they
will
now
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
do
we
want.
well
we
want
if
an
issue
arises
as
to
possible
disqualification,
we
want
them
to
tell
him
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
when
he
walks
in?
mr.
john
m.
creane
not
unless
the
department
raises
one.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no.
mr.
john
m.
creane
we
want
notice
from
the
point
at
which
the
department
says
it's
a
question,
we've
got
a
question
about
your
eligibility
then
we
want
notice.
mr.
john
m.
creane
that's
--
as
long
as
it's
effective
notice
but
we
would
want
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
he
can
waive
it
if
he
cares
to
and
say
i'd
rather
take
--
i'll
lose
my
week
now
rather
than
get
it
now
and
have
it
taken
away
from
me
later
on
when
it's
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
that's
not
notice,
not
when
you
walk
in
and
you're
told
that
moment,
we've
got
a
question
and
your
--
you
better
be
prepared
to
argue
your
case,
that's
not
a
notice.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
that
is
not
correct.
there
are
stipulations
of
fact
that
once
your
initial
entitlement
is
settled,
you
come
in
and
your
benefits
are
routinely
issued
to
you
on
the
basis
of
handing
in
a
signed
form
saying
that
you
look
for
work,
your
two
weeks
are
given
to
you,
the
seated
interview
is
the
exception.
it's
not
everyone
who
goes
into
that
office
gets
a
seated
interview
where
you
explain
to
the
person
what
you
did.
that's
the
exception
i
think
mr.
wasik
noted
that
today
that
there
are
far
fewer
of
them
than
claims
for
example.
so
you
don't
have
to
go
in
every
two
weeks
and
prove
that
you
were
out
--
well
you
do
it
away,
you
hand
in
a
form
but
you
don't
sit
down
and
explain
everything
you
did.
so
the
notice
you
get,
you're
plucked
from
the
claims
line
and
sent
over
for
a
seated
interview
if
there
is
any
question
about
the
way
you
filled
out
the
form
or
the
number
of
employers
you
listed
or
that
it's
not
signed
or
whatever.
mr.
john
m.
creane
where
we
want
the
notice?
no
we
don't
object
even
to
a
seated
interview.
i
think
in
most
cases,
it
will
establish
that
the
person
is
eligible.
where
we
want
the
notice
is
that
where
to
the
point
where
the
fact
finder
says
“i've
got
a
real
question
about
your
eligibility.”
fine,
he's
now
got
a
basis
to
say
there's
a
serious
question
about
eligibility,
a
hearing
will
be
held
a
week
from
now.
it's
up
to
the
department,
they
can
schedule
it
as
quickly
or
as
long
as
they
want
from
that
point
but
that's
the
point
where
we
want
notice.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
i
think
in
light
of
the
need
of
the
claimancy
as
opposed
to
the
--
there's
no
really
countervailing
interest
to
weigh
against
the
claimant.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no
and
most
--
there's
again
in
the
single
appendix,
over
50%
of
the
over
payments
are
recovered
by
the
state
of
connecticut.
this
is
not
like
welfare.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
that's
in
one
year.
now
that,
the
may
--
the
man
make
it
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
it's
actually
better
than
50/50.
that's
only
for
one
year.
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
there
were
none
but
in
light
of
the
impact
on
the
claimant,
mr.
miranda's
affidavit
presents
the
kind
of
impact
that
can
result.
the
man
was
denied
eight
consecutive
weeks,
he
had
no
money
for
rent,
no
money
for
food,
depending
on
handouts
from
friends,
you
know
call
it
brutal
need,
call
it
back
to
the
wall,
call
it
whatever
you
want
but
that's
real
recognizable
deprivation.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
there
is
no
--
unlike
new
york,
connecticut
has
no
aid
to
families
with
the
dependent
children
unemployed
parent
program.
that
was
one
of
the
factors
that
the
district
court
distinguished
(inaudible)
on.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
not
at
the
federal
level.
it
has
a
town
assistance
program.
some
of
the
claimants
are
clearly
not
eligible
if
they're
denied
for
refusing
a
job
offer,
by
statute
they
are
ineligible
for
any
town
assistance.
it's
kind
of
a
--
there's
no
way
of
really
telling
whether
someone
could
or
could
not
get
it.
some
absolutely
can't
by
law,
others
may.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
i
don't
think
in
the
three,
no.
some
of
the
proposed
interveners
that
were
not
allowed
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
don't
think
they
got
any
involvement
with
the
local
welfare
that
i
know
of.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
way
of
telling,
no.
obviously,
that
was
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
set
up
the
unemployment
compensation
act.
it
was
designed
not
to
have
the
stigma
of
welfare
attached
to
it.
it
was
a
separate,
partly
contractual,
partly
social
benefit
program
for
workers
and
i
think
it
frustrates
the
congressional
intent
to
say
well,
even
if
they
gave
them
the
business
over
there,
you
can
go
and
get
welfare.
mr.
john
m.
creane
he
relied
on
it,
right.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
he
relied
almost
exclusively
on
brutal
need.
i
think
this
court
has
gone
beyond
that
in
the
weighing
process
on
just
in
the
arnett
and
mitchell
versus
w.t.
grant
cases.
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that
simple
to
say
there's
no
brutal
need
absolutely
in
every
case
and
therefore
it's
distinguishable
from
goldberg
and
maybe
in
the
type
of
procedures
that
you
require
or
that
the
district
court
may
require,
they
recognize
that
in
their
opinion.
mr.
john
m.
creane
pardon?
mr.
john
m.
creane
it
did
but
there
you
had
a
governmental
interest
in
maintaining
efficiency
and
morale
and
proper
operation
of
the
department
that
virtually
locked
the
scales.
the
governmental
interest
was
so
strong,
at
least
the
majority
of
this
court
apparently
felt
that
way.
that
there
was
nothing
you
could
put
in
on
the
other
side
that
could
balance
the
scales
at
all.
here
we
have
very,
very
strong
individual
interest
and
minimal
state
interest.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes
the
reasonable
effort
is
not
the
only
grounds
for
disqualification
in
connecticut,
it's
about
60%
to
70%.
but
there
are
other
efforts,
i
mean
other
reasons,
refusal
of
a
suitable
job
offer
well
you
may
have
third
party
information
which
it's
undisputed.
the
fact
finder
is
free
to
rely
upon
just
on
the
basis
of
a
phone
call.
for
example
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
i
think
on
the
--
if
he
wants
to
go
out
and
bring
back
a
witness
the
next
day,
i'm
sure
the
department
will
not
deny
him
that
opportunity.
mr.
john
m.
creane
but
we're
talking
about
third
party
information
which
is
a
different
situation
where
they're
free
to
call
up
an
employer
and
say,
“was
this
man
at
your
plant?”
if
he
says,
no
never
heard
of
him.
he
is
free
of
stipulation
of
facts.
he
is
free
to
deny
that
claimant
at
that
point
on
the
basis
of
a
phone
conversation
with
an
employer
who
is
probably
so
busy
that
he
doesn't
have
the
fairness
idea
who
was
in
his
plant
in
the
last
week.
mr.
john
m.
creane
it's
in
the
stipulation
of
facts,
this
was
agreed
by
the
parties
and
it
was
the
finding
of
the
court.
i
mean
it
happens.
we
spent
a
lot
of
time.
mr.
john
m.
creane
i'm
giving
an
illustration
of
what
can
happen
under
the
seated
interview.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
both
parties
have
stipulated
that
this
example
can
happen
under
the
connecticut
seated
interview
system
that
the
fact
finder
is
free
to
do
it.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
proposed
consent
order
which
is
on
page
149
of
the
appendix.
the
department
has
stated
that
whenever
there
is
a
monetary
redetermination,
in
other
words,
a
man
comes
in,
applies
for
benefits,
they
find
him
eligible
and
then
they
find
out
they
made
an
error
later
on
and
that
he
really
didn't
have
sufficient
wage
credits.
they
have
now
recognized
in
even
in
that
situation
which
is
a
simple
monetary
calculation
involved,
did
he
have
enough
credits
or
didn't
he?
the
due
process
requires
that
they
give
him
notice
of
the
hearing,
right
to
bring
witnesses,
counsel,
everything
and
yet
they
stubbornly
maintain
that
in
situations
where
there
are
broad
fault
standards
involving
very
subjective
determinations
by
the
fact
finder,
that
they
are
not
going
to
give
that
same
type
of
hearing
in
that
situation.
and
we
find
that
inconsistent
for
them
to
maintain
that
position.
mr.
john
m.
creane
not,
--
i
don't
believe
that's
true
on
the
initial
determination,
that's
simply
bring
in
your
blue
slip
showing
that
you
were
laid
off
involuntarily
that
you
have
sufficient
wage
credits
to
entitlement
and
that
you're
registered
for
work
with
the
employment
service.
i
think
at
the
next
point,
the
next
visit
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
generally
another
appointment
is
set
and
you
comment
it's
in
the
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
that's
one
of
the
disqualifying
reasons,
yes
that
you
didn't
make
sufficient
effort.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
it's
a
disqualifying
reason.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
no
he
brings
--
he
hands
in
a
slip
attesting
what
he's
made
reasonable
efforts
and
that
he's
been
available
for
work.
mr.
john
m.
creane
the
actual
first
checks,
no.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
then
he
would
have
the
right
to
appeal
on
that
two
weeks
but
his
entitlement
has
still
been
set
under
connecticut
law
by
the
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
you're
right.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
john
m.
creane
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there
is
some
danger
in
this
case
of
a
danger
that
was
noted
by,
i
believe
was
justice
rehnquist
yesterday.
that
the
different
cases
being
argued
here
that
was
decided
by
the
district
court.
i
think
the
only
way
to
understand
this
case
is
to
go
through
the
record
and
check
my
statements
and
mr.
wasik's
against
what
the
court
found
below.
before
i
get
into
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
that
justice
stewart
raised
yesterday
concerning
the
rule
of
thumb
on
the
reasonable
work
effort.
you'll
find
that
at
page
20
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
district
court
opinion.
and
i'd
like
to
read
that
part
of
the
footnote
from
the
district
court
opinion.
the
district
court
said,
it
might
also
be
noted
that
the
record
discloses
some
uncertainty
about
the
standard
against
which
reasonableness
is
measured.
theodore
hatcher,
unemployment
compensation
director
for
connecticut
testified
that
there
is
an
informal
--
i'll
wait
until
you've
found
it,
i'm
sorry.
it's
on
the
footnote
25
on
page
20
(a).
mr.
john
m.
creane
20
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
hatcher
testified
that
there
was
a
rule
of
thumb
that
the
claimant
must
list
at
least
three
places
at
which
he
has
sought
employment
a
week
on
his
uc
45
form.
in
response
to
a
question
from
this
court,
mr.
hatcher
said
the
claimants
were
advised
to
this
rule
that
their
benefits,
rights
interviewed.
however,
eleanor
smarse,
manager
of
the
bridgeport
unemployment
compensation
office
responded
to
a
question
about
where
the
claimants
were
told
of
the
rule
of
thumb
by
stating
it
was
not
an
official
notification
that
they
were
to
tell
these
people
if
that
is
what
happened.
but
that
is,
there
is
no
official
number
or
anything
in
reference
to
this.
thus,
serious
questions
arise
about
whether
a
claimant
can
ever
meet
a
burden
of
proof
based
on
a
rule
of
thumb
that
he
has
never
heard
of.
indeed,
even
mr.
hatcher
conceded
that
in
crash
periods,
not
everyone
receives
a
benefit
rights
interview
at
which
the
information
is
supposedly
imparted.
the
actual
testimony
for
those
that
want
to
compare
the
context
of
that
from
mrs.
smarse
is
at
page
87
through
90
of
the
single
appendix
and
on
mr.
hatcher
pages
193
through
194
(a)
of
the
single
appendix.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
the
conflict
was
between
the
director,
mr.
hatcher
and
the
office
manager,
one
of
them
was
saying,
well
yes,
of
course
everyone
hears
about
it
and
the
person
who
administers
the
program
at
the
local
office
said
“no,
we
don't
tell
them
there's
no
magic
number.”
sometimes
three
is
enough,
maybe
it
isn't,
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
i
think
they
did.
thus
serious
questions
arise
though
whether
a
claimant
can
ever
meet
a
burden
of
prove
that
he's
never
heard
about.
i
think
that
clearly
resolves
it,
at
least
it
does
in
my
mind.
now
mr.
wasik
stated
yesterday
that
he
wasn't
sure
that
the
fact
finders,
all
of
the
fact
finders
knew
about
it.
these
are
the
people,
they
are
administering
the
program
and
he
wasn't
sure
if
they
had
heard
about
the
rule
thumb
but
that
he
was
pretty
sure
that
the
claimants
knew
about
it.
now,
i'm
not
sure
what
that
means
that
the
people
running
the
system
may
not
know
about
it
but
the
claimants
apparently
know
about
it.
there
is
just
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
a
finding
that
any
claimant
knew
about
this
rule
of
thumb
and
in
fact,
to
the
contrary,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
depositions
of
one
of
the
original
plaintiffs
who
mr.
wasik
did
not
mention
during
his
argument.
that
would
be
mrs.
trianna.
i
think
she
presents
a
fair
representation
of
what
can
happen
to
a
person
going
through
the
system.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
i
think
mr.
--
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
laid
down
what
he
feels
is
the
basic
issue
before
this
court,
is
it
a
fair
system?
and
that
i
intend
to
go
into
the
defects
found
by
the
district
court
in
the
seated
interview
procedure
and
demonstrate
a
hope
that
the
district
court
was
correct.
mr.
wasik
is
saying
they
were
wrong
and
the
rule
of
thumb
is
just
one
small
dose
of
the
type
of
fairness
that
many
claimants
encounter
in
the
unemployment
system
in
connecticut,
they're
not
told
about
it.
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
the
question
i
think
is,
how
can
a
claimant
satisfy
a
standard
which
he
doesn't
know
about?
mr.
john
m.
creane
the
standard
i
think
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
that's
on
page
258
of
the
appendix.
hereafter,
this
is
the
only
guidance
that
a
claimant
gets
on
the
issue
of
reasonable
effort.
your
efforts
to
get
a
job
must
be
the
efforts
which
a
person
out
of
work
would
make
if
he
is
sincerely
looking
for
work.
i
think
that
standard
and
maybe
the
best
that
could
be
managed
but
it's
devoid
of
any
kind
of
guidance
i
think
largely
for
claimant
and
at
least
some
(inaudible),
other
fact
finder
applying
whatever
standard
he
happens
to
feel
is
reasonable
for
that
claimant.
now
there
are
some
office
memos
that
are
also
set
out
in
the
appendix
that
spell
out
in
more
detail
what
reasonable
effort
it
is
and
as
mrs.
smarse
in
her
deposition
stated,
there
is
virtually
an
infinite
number
of
factors
that
can
be
taken
into
account
on
determining
reasonable
effort.
the
only
one
who
has
access
to
any
of
these
memos,
or
has
any
idea
of
what
standard
he
is
being
measured
against
is
the
fact
finder.
the
claimant
simply
goes
into
it
blind.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no
i
don't
think
that
would
be
practical
mr.
justice.
what
we're
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
that
may
be
what's
intended
but
it
still
comes
down
with
subjective
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
apparently
not.
it
comes
down
pretty
much
to
a
subjective
determination.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
it
depends
for
one
thing
the
department
has
recognized
that
the
unemployment
rate
in
the
area
is
one
of
the
factors
that
a
fact
finder
should
take
into
consideration
on
what
is
reasonable.
obviously
if
there
are
a
lot
of
jobs
available,
you're
expected
to
go
out
and
find
one
of
them
as
suppose
to
when
there
are
fewer
or
none,
the
department
is
recognized
that
there
is
little
point
in
making
a
person
run
around
fruitlessly.
and
yet,
again
in
the
deposition
of
mrs.
smarse,
she
said
that
she
has
never
--
as
far
as
she
knows,
they're
not
--
the
fact
finders
are
not
given
that
information
and
she's
never
seen
it
in
a
fact
finding
decision
and
yet
that's
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
factors
on
reasonable
effort.
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
think
that
is
reflected
in
department
memos
that
they
will
not
require
fruitless
chasing
around
when
there
simply
are
no
jobs
available.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
certainly.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes.
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
can
--
if
you
look
at
page
117
(a)
of
the
single
appendix
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
yes
mr.
justice.
it's
right
about
in
the
middle
of
paragraph
two
on
what
constitutes
reasonable
effort.
beginning
with
if
however,
there
is
very
little
hiring
taking
place
because
of
depressed
economic
activity
and
the
employment
service
has
most
of
the
existing
jobs
listed
in
its
files
than
a
less
complete
round
of
visits
to
possible
employers
as
indicated.
that's
one
of
the
factors
that
a
fact
finder
is
supposed
to
take
into
consideration.
apparently
they're
not
given
the
information
on
what
the
unemployment
rate
is,
that
was
in
the
deposition
of
the
office
manager.
mr.
john
m.
creane
oh
yes,
that's
--
i
mean
those
are
department
of
labor
statistics
that
are
available
by
region.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
it's
i
believe
monthly
information
which
is
not
passed
on
to
the
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
taking
into
consideration
on
making
a
determination.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
there
is
some
time
like
to
be
sure
but
that's
true
of
any
of
our
governmental
statistics,
it's
the
most
accurate
information
available.
mr.
john
m.
creane
what
we
are
seeking
in
this
case
is
exactly
what
the
state
of
connecticut
is
giving
to
other
claimants
in
more
or
less
the
same
circumstances.
in
fact,
where
there
is
less
compelling
reasons
for
a
hearing.
mr.
john
m.
creane
something
certainly
more
than
a
probable
cause
hearing
in
light
of
the
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
because
we
feel
that
there's
very
strong
presence
of
two
factors
that
i
believe
you
pointed
out
in
the
arnett
versus
kennedy
case.
there's
a
very
strong
individual
interest
in
the
deprivation
of
benefits
in
this
case
and
i'd
like
to
go
into
the
need
aspect
of
this
program.
and
secondly
as
the
risk
of
error
at
the
initial
determination
and
it's
a
very
substantial
risk
of
error
and
thirdly,
we're
not
talking
about
simple
mathematical
calculations
that
are
easily
solved
by
documentary
proof.
we're
talking
about
the
application
of
broad
fault
standards,
reasonable
effort.
mr.
john
m.
creane
on
a
probable
cause
hearing?
no,
even
the
present
procedures
would
not
constitute
a
probable
cause
hearing,
in
light
of
the
defects
that
were
noted
by
the
district
court.
i
think
at
a
minimum,
the
claimant
has
to
have
advanced
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
bring
witnesses
with
him.
now,
it's
undisputed
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
pardon?
mr.
john
m.
creane
what,
advanced
notice?
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
think
the
criminal
situation
was
not
analogous
to
a
man
or
may
be
his
only
source
of
income
being
taken
away
from
him.
i
think
it's
very
close
to
the
welfare
situation,
if
not
exactly
on
all
force.
although,
i
recognize
that
there
is
no
need
test
in
unemployment.
there's
no
requirement
that
you
demonstrate
need.
i
think
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
java
that
congress
intended
this
as
a
salary
replacement
during
the
worker's
period
of
unemployment.
and
i
think
it's
also
un-disputable
that
many
unemployment
claimants
are
living
very
close
to
the
edge
of
subsistence
and
it
isn't
very
difficult
to
see
why.
in
connecticut,
the
average
wage
several
years
ago
was
$150.00
a
week.
the
average
claimant
received
40%
of
that
average
income
which
comes
out
to
about
$60.00
a
week.
before
his
benefits
are
even
terminated,
his
back
may
already
be
to
the
wall.
he
may
already
be
in
a
position
where
he's
just
on
a
subsistence
income
there
without
talking
about
denying
any
additional
benefits.
now,
there
was
one
other
point,
mr.
justice
that
you
raised
about
a
week
to
week,
the
man
can
go
back
out
again
and
get
his
benefits.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
--
again
in
the
appendix,
to
the
affidavit
of
mrs.
triana.
that
would
be
at
page
135
(a).
i'm
not
going
to
read
the
entire
affidavit
but
the
gist
of
it
is,
this
is
what
happened
to
mrs.
triana.
she
had
been
collecting
for
two
to
four
weeks.
she
walked
in
to
the
unemployment
office
in
bridgeport
and
they
said,
you
haven't
filled
out
your
card
properly,
now
the
woman
doesn't
speak
english.
to
my
knowledge,
this
benefit
rights
booklet
is
not
even
reproduced
in
spanish
or
at
least
it
was
not
at
that
time.
they
said
no,
you
didn't
use
reasonable
effort,
fill
out
this
form
properly
next
time
you
come
back
in.
she
came
back
in
two
weeks
later
and
she
had
her
six
signatures
on
the
card.
she
hadn't
write
down
there
and
they
said
“well,
you
did
it
all
in
one
day,”
that
isn't
reasonable
effort
and
she
explained
to
them
that
her
son
who
acted
as
her
interpreter,
had
to
go
around
with
her
on
the
one
day
that
he
could,
off
again.
she
was
denied
six
consecutive
weeks,
finally
got
her
hearing
about
three
months
later
and
the
commissioner
found,
one
of
his
finding
is
the
fact
is
that
she
was
desperate
for
work.
she
sought
work
throughout
the
labor
market.
he
restored
for
those
six
weeks.
mr.
miranda,
another
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
denied
eight
consecutive
weeks
on
the
issue
of
reasonable
effort.
no,
the
first
two
or
four
were
unreasonable
effort,
the
next
four
they
denied
simply
because
he
had
an
appeal
pending.
it's
against
department
policy
but
it's
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
that
it
happens.
when
he
got
his
hearing,
the
commissioner
restored
all
eight
weeks
and
said
that
that
fact
finder
was
wrong
eight
times
in
a
row
on
the
issue
of
reasonable
effort.
so
i
think
that,
while
the
department
policy
is
that
it's
week
by
week,
very
often
that
is
not
the
impact
on
the
claimant.
mr.
john
m.
creane
what
type
of
notice?
well
i
think
on
the
--
there's
a
good
model
for
this
court,
for
the
district
court
to
follow
if
it's
affirmed
and
remanded
in
the
proposed
consent
order
that
the
state
has
filed
in
this
case.
i
think
this
is
important
for
the
court
to
take
note
of.
what
the
department
has
said
is
that
on
an
initial
--
on
a
redetermination
of
eligibility,
on
an
initial
disqualification,
they
now
recognize
that
due
process
requires
that
they
give
advance
notice,
right
to
bring
in
counsel,
right
to
present
evidence.
that's
what
we're
looking
for
and
they're
giving
it
in
situations
where
a
claimant,
they
feel
--
they
had
made
an
error
on
this
initial
wage
credits
and
they
--
it's
a
simple
mathematical
calculation
and
yet
they
recognized
they
will
now
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
do
we
want.
well
we
want
if
an
issue
arises
as
to
possible
disqualification,
we
want
them
to
tell
him
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
when
he
walks
in?
mr.
john
m.
creane
not
unless
the
department
raises
one.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no.
mr.
john
m.
creane
we
want
notice
from
the
point
at
which
the
department
says
it's
a
question,
we've
got
a
question
about
your
eligibility
then
we
want
notice.
mr.
john
m.
creane
that's
--
as
long
as
it's
effective
notice
but
we
would
want
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
he
can
waive
it
if
he
cares
to
and
say
i'd
rather
take
--
i'll
lose
my
week
now
rather
than
get
it
now
and
have
it
taken
away
from
me
later
on
when
it's
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
that's
not
notice,
not
when
you
walk
in
and
you're
told
that
moment,
we've
got
a
question
and
your
--
you
better
be
prepared
to
argue
your
case,
that's
not
a
notice.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
that
is
not
correct.
there
are
stipulations
of
fact
that
once
your
initial
entitlement
is
settled,
you
come
in
and
your
benefits
are
routinely
issued
to
you
on
the
basis
of
handing
in
a
signed
form
saying
that
you
look
for
work,
your
two
weeks
are
given
to
you,
the
seated
interview
is
the
exception.
it's
not
everyone
who
goes
into
that
office
gets
a
seated
interview
where
you
explain
to
the
person
what
you
did.
that's
the
exception
i
think
mr.
wasik
noted
that
today
that
there
are
far
fewer
of
them
than
claims
for
example.
so
you
don't
have
to
go
in
every
two
weeks
and
prove
that
you
were
out
--
well
you
do
it
away,
you
hand
in
a
form
but
you
don't
sit
down
and
explain
everything
you
did.
so
the
notice
you
get,
you're
plucked
from
the
claims
line
and
sent
over
for
a
seated
interview
if
there
is
any
question
about
the
way
you
filled
out
the
form
or
the
number
of
employers
you
listed
or
that
it's
not
signed
or
whatever.
mr.
john
m.
creane
where
we
want
the
notice?
no
we
don't
object
even
to
a
seated
interview.
i
think
in
most
cases,
it
will
establish
that
the
person
is
eligible.
where
we
want
the
notice
is
that
where
to
the
point
where
the
fact
finder
says
“i've
got
a
real
question
about
your
eligibility.”
fine,
he's
now
got
a
basis
to
say
there's
a
serious
question
about
eligibility,
a
hearing
will
be
held
a
week
from
now.
it's
up
to
the
department,
they
can
schedule
it
as
quickly
or
as
long
as
they
want
from
that
point
but
that's
the
point
where
we
want
notice.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
i
think
in
light
of
the
need
of
the
claimancy
as
opposed
to
the
--
there's
no
really
countervailing
interest
to
weigh
against
the
claimant.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no
and
most
--
there's
again
in
the
single
appendix,
over
50%
of
the
over
payments
are
recovered
by
the
state
of
connecticut.
this
is
not
like
welfare.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
that's
in
one
year.
now
that,
the
may
--
the
man
make
it
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
it's
actually
better
than
50/50.
that's
only
for
one
year.
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
there
were
none
but
in
light
of
the
impact
on
the
claimant,
mr.
miranda's
affidavit
presents
the
kind
of
impact
that
can
result.
the
man
was
denied
eight
consecutive
weeks,
he
had
no
money
for
rent,
no
money
for
food,
depending
on
handouts
from
friends,
you
know
call
it
brutal
need,
call
it
back
to
the
wall,
call
it
whatever
you
want
but
that's
real
recognizable
deprivation.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
there
is
no
--
unlike
new
york,
connecticut
has
no
aid
to
families
with
the
dependent
children
unemployed
parent
program.
that
was
one
of
the
factors
that
the
district
court
distinguished
(inaudible)
on.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
not
at
the
federal
level.
it
has
a
town
assistance
program.
some
of
the
claimants
are
clearly
not
eligible
if
they're
denied
for
refusing
a
job
offer,
by
statute
they
are
ineligible
for
any
town
assistance.
it's
kind
of
a
--
there's
no
way
of
really
telling
whether
someone
could
or
could
not
get
it.
some
absolutely
can't
by
law,
others
may.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
i
don't
think
in
the
three,
no.
some
of
the
proposed
interveners
that
were
not
allowed
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
i
don't
think
they
got
any
involvement
with
the
local
welfare
that
i
know
of.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
way
of
telling,
no.
obviously,
that
was
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
set
up
the
unemployment
compensation
act.
it
was
designed
not
to
have
the
stigma
of
welfare
attached
to
it.
it
was
a
separate,
partly
contractual,
partly
social
benefit
program
for
workers
and
i
think
it
frustrates
the
congressional
intent
to
say
well,
even
if
they
gave
them
the
business
over
there,
you
can
go
and
get
welfare.
mr.
john
m.
creane
he
relied
on
it,
right.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
he
relied
almost
exclusively
on
brutal
need.
i
think
this
court
has
gone
beyond
that
in
the
weighing
process
on
just
in
the
arnett
and
mitchell
versus
w.t.
grant
cases.
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that
simple
to
say
there's
no
brutal
need
absolutely
in
every
case
and
therefore
it's
distinguishable
from
goldberg
and
maybe
in
the
type
of
procedures
that
you
require
or
that
the
district
court
may
require,
they
recognize
that
in
their
opinion.
mr.
john
m.
creane
pardon?
mr.
john
m.
creane
it
did
but
there
you
had
a
governmental
interest
in
maintaining
efficiency
and
morale
and
proper
operation
of
the
department
that
virtually
locked
the
scales.
the
governmental
interest
was
so
strong,
at
least
the
majority
of
this
court
apparently
felt
that
way.
that
there
was
nothing
you
could
put
in
on
the
other
side
that
could
balance
the
scales
at
all.
here
we
have
very,
very
strong
individual
interest
and
minimal
state
interest.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes
the
reasonable
effort
is
not
the
only
grounds
for
disqualification
in
connecticut,
it's
about
60%
to
70%.
but
there
are
other
efforts,
i
mean
other
reasons,
refusal
of
a
suitable
job
offer
well
you
may
have
third
party
information
which
it's
undisputed.
the
fact
finder
is
free
to
rely
upon
just
on
the
basis
of
a
phone
call.
for
example
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
i
think
on
the
--
if
he
wants
to
go
out
and
bring
back
a
witness
the
next
day,
i'm
sure
the
department
will
not
deny
him
that
opportunity.
mr.
john
m.
creane
but
we're
talking
about
third
party
information
which
is
a
different
situation
where
they're
free
to
call
up
an
employer
and
say,
“was
this
man
at
your
plant?”
if
he
says,
no
never
heard
of
him.
he
is
free
of
stipulation
of
facts.
he
is
free
to
deny
that
claimant
at
that
point
on
the
basis
of
a
phone
conversation
with
an
employer
who
is
probably
so
busy
that
he
doesn't
have
the
fairness
idea
who
was
in
his
plant
in
the
last
week.
mr.
john
m.
creane
it's
in
the
stipulation
of
facts,
this
was
agreed
by
the
parties
and
it
was
the
finding
of
the
court.
i
mean
it
happens.
we
spent
a
lot
of
time.
mr.
john
m.
creane
i'm
giving
an
illustration
of
what
can
happen
under
the
seated
interview.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
both
parties
have
stipulated
that
this
example
can
happen
under
the
connecticut
seated
interview
system
that
the
fact
finder
is
free
to
do
it.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
proposed
consent
order
which
is
on
page
149
of
the
appendix.
the
department
has
stated
that
whenever
there
is
a
monetary
redetermination,
in
other
words,
a
man
comes
in,
applies
for
benefits,
they
find
him
eligible
and
then
they
find
out
they
made
an
error
later
on
and
that
he
really
didn't
have
sufficient
wage
credits.
they
have
now
recognized
in
even
in
that
situation
which
is
a
simple
monetary
calculation
involved,
did
he
have
enough
credits
or
didn't
he?
the
due
process
requires
that
they
give
him
notice
of
the
hearing,
right
to
bring
witnesses,
counsel,
everything
and
yet
they
stubbornly
maintain
that
in
situations
where
there
are
broad
fault
standards
involving
very
subjective
determinations
by
the
fact
finder,
that
they
are
not
going
to
give
that
same
type
of
hearing
in
that
situation.
and
we
find
that
inconsistent
for
them
to
maintain
that
position.
mr.
john
m.
creane
not,
--
i
don't
believe
that's
true
on
the
initial
determination,
that's
simply
bring
in
your
blue
slip
showing
that
you
were
laid
off
involuntarily
that
you
have
sufficient
wage
credits
to
entitlement
and
that
you're
registered
for
work
with
the
employment
service.
i
think
at
the
next
point,
the
next
visit
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
generally
another
appointment
is
set
and
you
comment
it's
in
the
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
that's
one
of
the
disqualifying
reasons,
yes
that
you
didn't
make
sufficient
effort.
mr.
john
m.
creane
no,
it's
a
disqualifying
reason.
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
no
he
brings
--
he
hands
in
a
slip
attesting
what
he's
made
reasonable
efforts
and
that
he's
been
available
for
work.
mr.
john
m.
creane
the
actual
first
checks,
no.
mr.
john
m.
creane
well,
then
he
would
have
the
right
to
appeal
on
that
two
weeks
but
his
entitlement
has
still
been
set
under
connecticut
law
by
the
--
mr.
john
m.
creane
yes,
you're
right.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
