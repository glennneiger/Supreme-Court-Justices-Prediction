justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
connecticut.
appellees
claiming
continuing
eligibility
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits
challenge
the
validity
of
connecticut
procedures
for
determining
that
eligibility.
the
district
court
sustained
the
challenge
on
due
process
grounds
and
the
state
appealed.
following
our
noting
of
probable
jurisdiction,
the
connecticut
legislature
enacted
major
revisions
of
these
procedures.
we
concluded
from
our
examination
of
connecticut
as
revised
that
the
changes
were
significant
and
could
affect
the
merits
of
this
case.
we
therefore
vacate
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
remand
the
case
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
intervening
changes
in
connecticut
law.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
