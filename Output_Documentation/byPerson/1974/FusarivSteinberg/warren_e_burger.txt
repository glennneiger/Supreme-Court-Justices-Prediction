chief

warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-848,
fusari
against
steinberg.
mr.
wasik
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
maybe
that
it
would
be
to
say
he
is
guilty
if
you
can
use
that
term
of
not
establishing
his
eligibility.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
is
--
are
you
telling
us
that
this
is
in
effect
to
burden
of
proof
which
he
must
meet
periodically
just
as
he
must
meet
it
the
first
time
that
he
comes
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
he
came
on
the
first
day
and
said
i
want
some
benefits,
but
refused
to
answer
any
questions,
then
he
wouldn't
get
any
benefits,
as
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
pick
up
at
that
point
in
the
morning
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
number
73-848
and
you
may
proceed
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
at
this
early
stage,
the
applicant
is
asked
some
questions
which
involved
his
efforts
to
get
work
and
some
challenge
is
made
to
that,
is
he
permitted
an
opportunity
to
corroborate
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
i
suppose
a
letter
from
some
perspective
employer
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
says
that
he
had
no
work
that
week
but
if
he'd
come
back
two
weeks
later,
he
might
have
something
for
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
higher
than
the
national
average?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
creane?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
possible
to
have
a
man
or
a
public
announcement
of
all
the
factors
that
would
relate
to
every
type
of
confinement
in
every
type
of
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
this
manual
section
that
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
communicate
to
an
applicant
that
is
supposed
to
do
or
she
is
supposed
to
do,
whatever
he
or
she
would
do
to
get
a
job
if
there
were
a
no
unemployment
insurance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
it
come
through?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what
else
would
it
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
it
is
a
policy
decision
that
the
harder
a
job
is
defined,
the
less
you're
supposed
to
do
to
find
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
that
vary
with
the
kind
of
work?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
if
as
the
present
economic
condition
is
today,
the
building
trades
are
having
a
very
high
rate
of
unemployment,
it
is
reasonable
to
think
that
a
man
skilled
in
the
building
trades
is
going
to
have
greater
difficulty
finding
employment,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
suggest
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
united
states
government
of
the
state
of
connecticut
to
say
because
it's
harder
to
get
a
job,
therefore
you
don't
have
to
try
as
much?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
the
agents
in
necessarily
know
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
particular
day
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
they
might
as
different
once
a
month
so
that
at
any
given
time,
the
information
might
be
one
month
out
of
date.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
he
ineligible
for
welfare?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
mr.
wasik
in
response
to
some
questions
earlier.
you
say
that
if
any
problem
arose
at
the
initial
discussion.
in
other
words,
if
the
interviewer
was
not
satisfied
with
the
efforts
to
obtain
employment
and
the
applicant
said,
well
i
can
--
if
you
can
give
me
two
or
three
days,
i'll
get
you
some
letters.
he
said
that's
routinely
afforded
now.
is
there
some
notice
beyond
that
that
you
are
urging?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
wasik
has
indicated
that
if
such
a
situation
arises,
he's
given
whatever
reasonable
time
is
required
to
demonstrate
and
record
his
view
of
the
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
give
a
letter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you're
generalizing,
pretty
sweeping
way,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
make
a
finding
on
--
which
supports
the
sweeping
statement
that
you
just
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
let's
find
connecticut
in
stipulation,
isn't
it
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
creane.
mr.
wasik
you
have
the
about
six
minutes
if
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
how
many
employees
the
state
of
connecticut
has
involved
in
the
unemployment
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
recall
what
it
is,
do
you,
the
numbers
of
people?
chief
