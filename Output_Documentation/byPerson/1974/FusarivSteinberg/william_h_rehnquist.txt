a

mr.
wasik,
you
said
under
connecticut
law,
the
claimant
must
each
week
qualify
for
the
benefits.
do
you
mean
by
that
that
each
week
he
has
to
show
that
he
has
made
some
effort
to
obtain
employment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
witnesses,
you
mean
on
the
appeal
hearing
or
at
the
seated
interview?
justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
wasik,
mr.
steinberg
lost
on
his
appeal
to
the
board,
didn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
to
the
commission
and
then
he
had
a
right
to
appeal
that
determination
to
the
superior
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
would
he
have
had
a
right
to
raise
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
hearing
in
the
superior
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on

what
mr.
creane?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
consider
this
a
conflict
of
fact
and
resolve
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
two
witnesses
testifying
the
two
different
situations.
i
would
think
if
the
district
court
is
conducting
a
factual
hearing,
it
would
resolve
that
and
say
we
believe
a
or
we
believe
b.
justice

any
way

not
they

have
been
eligible
for
town
assistance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
judge

inconsistent
