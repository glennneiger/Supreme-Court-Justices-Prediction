mr.
donald
e.
wasik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
class
action
suit
concerns
the
adequacy
of
connecticut's
administrative
procedures
which
i
used
to
determine
weekly
claims
for
unemployment
compensation.
a
three-judge
district
court
had
before
it
two
issues.
one,
do
the
connecticut
procedures
violate
the
so-called
when
due
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
and
two,
do
they
violate
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
lower
court
found
that
there
was
no
statutory
violation
but
did
rule
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
since
the
district
court
found
no
statutory
violation
and
because
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
decision
by
the
claimants,
this
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
therefore
the
only
statement
on
the
merits
of
this
issue
which
has
been
raised
in
my
opponent's
brief
is
that
the
lower
court
and
the
court
in
the
torres,
the
decisions
were
correct
in
ruling
that
where
a
decision
is
made,
that
the
claimant
is
not
eligible
for
benefits,
obviously
then
no
benefits
are
due
and
therefore
the
when
due
provision
cannot
be
violated.
the
issues
that
are
here
are
one,
whether
connecticut's
administrative
hearing
which
employs
a
seated
interview
system
meets
due
process
requirements.
and
two,
whether
the
district
court
in
determining
this
first
issue
erred
in
receiving
in
considering
evidence
which
relates
to
the
appeal
period
subsequent
to
the
hearing
in
question.
facts
generally
here
concern
individuals
who
have
filed
an
initial
application
for
benefits.
they
have
satisfied
the
department
that
they
have
registered
for
work
with
the
employment
service
and
that
they
have
met
the
wage
credits
requirement
of
the
statute.
in
other
words
they
have
enough
earned
wages
from
a
former
employer
prior
to
their
unemployment.
these
people
then
go
on
a
bi-weekly
basis
to
the
local
office
where
they
submit
a
form
showing
where
they
have
gone
to
seek
work
during
the
past
two
weeks.
now
although
they
go
every
two
weeks,
statutes
require
a
determination
each
week
as
to
eligibility.
when
they
go
to
this
interviewer,
the
interviewer
usually
will
ask
some
questions
such
as
“did
you
earn
any
wages
during
this
two-week
period?
were
you
able
to
work
during
this
period?”
he
will
look
at
the
form.
if
it
seems
as
though
he
has
made
reasonable
efforts
during
that
week,
he
will
receive
his
check.
if
a
question
is
raised
by
what
the
claimant
says
or
what
is
in
that
form,
the
claimant
is
then
referred
to
another
interviewer
behind
the
counter.
this
is
the
fact-finding
examiner
who
will
then
go
into
greater
detail
in
discussing
with
the
claimant
what
efforts
he
has
made
to
seek
work
during
those
two
weeks
just
ended.
now,
that
basically
is
the
situation
that
is
before
us.
and
as
you
can
see,
this
situation
is
far
different
from
that
in
goldberg
against
kelly.
the
claimant
here
actually
presents
his
case
to
the
decision
maker.
this
was
the
“fatal
flaw”
which
was
found
in
the
goldberg
case.
he
is
heard.
in
the
welfare
cases,
generally
the
recipient
only
has
to
establish
need
at
the
initial
proceedings
when
he
first
applies.
he
then
proceeds
to
be
paid
unless
and
until
his
status
changes.
in
unemployment
compensation
cases,
not
only
is
there
no
needs
test
but
the
statutes
providing
for
these
benefits
also
require
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
each
claimant
to
each
week
qualify
for
benefits.
now,
would
our
connecticut's
procedures,
which
we
submit
meet
due
process
requirements?
first,
what
do
we
mean
by
due
process?
we
submit
the
essence
of
due
process
is
fairness,
considering
all
the
relevant
factors,
are
connecticut's
procedures
fair?
let
us
see.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
exactly
that
your
honor.
in
connecticut
the
claimant
has
notice
of
the
interview.
when
he
first
applies,
he
is
given
a
booklet
that
is
entitled
“your
rights
and
responsibilities,”
under
the
connecticut
unemployment
compensation
law.
as
the
name
implies,
the
claimant
has
responsibilities.
not
the
first
of
which
is
to
read
this
booklet
which
not
only
tells
him
what
his
obligations
are
but
gives
him
helpful
information
as
to
how
he
can
meet
these
obligations.
more
importantly,
these
claimants
are
experienced.
all
of
the
named
claimants
in
this
case
receive
benefits
for
varying
periods
of
time.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no
your
honor
because
the
claimant
--
except
in
the
booklet
itself,
he
knows
that
he
has
to
show
where
and
when
he
went
to
seek
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
we
can't,
we
don't
know
ourselves
until
he
appears.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
only
we
try
to,
that
that's
--
well
i
won't
say
it's
rare.
this
is
why
he
registers
with
the
employment
service.
the
employment
service
tries
to
establish
referrals
and
when
we
learn
that
this
man
might
be
suited
for
this
job
and
there
is
an
opening,
he
is
referred.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor
but
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
can
bring
anybody
he
wants
as
a
witness,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
well
your
honor,
if
the
claimant
has
been
receiving
benefits,
he
already
by
his
experience,
knows
what
he
must
do
to
collect
those
benefits,
therefore,
during
that
two-week
period,
if
he
knows
that
instead
of
going
out
looking
for
a
job
for
three
days,
he
was
out
fishing,
he
knows
unless
he
gets
off
his
button
and
looks
those
last
two
days,
there’s
going
to
be
a
question
as
to
what
efforts
he
made.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
not
necessarily
but
certainly
he's
going
to
be
questioned
as
to
what
efforts
he's
made.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
but
we
have
no
information.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
there
are
no
charges
made.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
he
did
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
that
he
did
search
for
work
and
that
he
was
not
restricting
his
availability
to
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
excuse
me
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
the
word
guilty
has
a
connotation
which
is
not
applicable
in
this
case,
i
submit
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
has
failed
to
meet
his
responsibilities
as
outlined
by
the
statutes
and
by
the
booklet
he
receives,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
that's
right.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
he
starts
off
by
showing
that
he's
registered
for
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
but
he
also
must
show
that
he
has
looked
for
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
excuse
me
your
honor,
he's
not
charged
with
not
having
found
work.
he
may
be
charged,
if
i
may
use
that
term
and
i
don't
like
it.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
it
is
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
efforts
that
he
made
to
seek
work
are
not
reasonable,
there's
quite
a
difference
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
the
booklet
itself.
he
must
make
reasonable
efforts
to
find
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
well
it's
defined
in
the
booklet
your
honor,
for
his
benefit.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
but
this
is
a
standard
that's
applied
throughout
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no
he
doesn't
have
to
explain
why,
your
honor.
if
he
has
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
has
a
form
which
shows
where
he
went
to
seek
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
they
will
ask
him,
where
did
you
go
to
look
for
work?
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
if
he
fails
to
answer,
he
will
be
denied
benefits.
the
statutes
and
the
booklet
tell
him
he
must
make
efforts.
and
if
he
doesn't
communicate
those
efforts
to
us,
how
can
we
pay
him
benefits?
this
is
a
trust
fund
that
the
administrator
as
a
fiduciary
must
administer
with
reasonable
diligence.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
your
honor,
say
burden
of
proof
but
certainly
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
the
burden
is
on
him
to
show
eligibility,
the
statutes
require
this.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
he
would
not
have
satisfied
the
basic
requirement
of
giving
us
information
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
in
fact,
the
plaintiff
steinberg
collected
for
26
consecutive
weeks
and
he
was
advised
at
this
seated
interview,
more
than
one
seated
interview
that
he
had
better
improved
his
efforts
to
find
work.
don't
restrict
yourself
to
making
contacts
with
the
local
union
hawk,
but
he
did
and
finally
he
was
denied
benefits.
sure
because
he
didn't
meet
the
--
he
didn't
heed
the
advice
given
to
him
that
he
has
to
make
efforts,
reasonable
efforts.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
there
is
a
rule
of
thumb,
it's
not
followed
categorically.
again,
it
prints,
the
lower
court
says,
give
them
in
advance
a
certain
number
of
places
to
go.
well
this
just
wouldn't
work
out.
if
you
required
somebody
who
is
looking
for
a
waiter's
job
to
go
to
10
places,
this
might
be
reasonable.
but
a
professor
of
some
university
was
out
of
a
job,
there
are
just
so
many
places
he
can
go
and
you
can't
require
him
to
go
to
10
places.
what
is
reasonable
for
the
individual?
each
case
has
to
be
determined
on
its
own
merits.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
for
the
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
for
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
if
they
--
during
this
period
when
they're
using
this
form,
the
examiners
at
the
counter,
if
they
went
through
three
places
in
one
week,
for
a
each
week
then
they
were
given
their
check,
there
were
no
questions
raised.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
think
it
was,
your
honor,
i
can't
say
that
everybody,
that
each
examiner
knew
that.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
can't
speak
for
what's
in
the
mind
of
the
beneficiaries
but
i
would
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
think
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
think
it
was
common
knowledge
that
if
they
--
the
form
had
six
places
for
the
two
week
period
and
if
they
filled
out.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
like
to
see
more
lines
actually.
now
the
claimant
does
have
notice
of
the
issues.
the
lower
court
either
deliberately
ignored
or
completely
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
issue
is
not
known
to
the
department
employee
until
the
claimant
appears.
the
claimant
however
knows
what
he's
done
regarding
his
own
efforts,
whether
or
not
he
has
restricted
himself,
his
rest
to
hours
or
conditions
of
employment.
thus
he
alone
knows
before
the
hearing
takes
place
what
issues
might
be
raised?
the
claimant
has
an
opportunity
to
present
witnesses.
now
in
the
majority
of
the
cases
certainly
there
simply
are
no
witnesses.
the
decision
is
based
on
the
facts
given
by
the
claimant
himself.
there
were
not
witnesses
in
the
steinberg
case
nor
were
there
any
witnesses
in
any
of
the
cases
of
the
named
claimants
in
this
action.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
at
the
seated
interview,
your
honor.
if
the
claimant
should
need
a
witness,
the
record
shows
that
he
has
given
time
to
obtain
one.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no
your
honor,
no.
it
might
--
if
he
were
ill
for
one
or
two
days,
then
the
latter
part
of
that
week,
he
made
sufficient
efforts,
reasonable
efforts,
he
will
probably
be
paid.
but
if
the
man
is
sick
for
let's
say
four
days
out
of
the
week,
the
statute
says
that
he
must
be
physically
and
mentally
able
to
work.
he
would
not
meet
that
requirement.
therefore
he
would
not
receive
benefits
for
that
week.
the
philosophy
behind
this
unemployment
compensation
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
has
to
--
right
and
to
look
for.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
thank
you.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
emphasize
that
the
interviews
in
question
here
are
not
contests
between
the
department
employee
and
the
claimant.
the
employee
is
a
neutral
party.
he
is
just
gathering
the
facts.
he
has
no
interest,
there's
no
money
coming
out
of
his
own
pocket
here.
there
are
no
charges
or
any
defenses
that
the
claimant
has
to
meet
or
make.
all
he
has
to
do
is
tell
it
like
it
is
or
was
the
past
two
weeks.
the
steinberg
situation
shows
that
the
seated
interviews
do
not
always
result
in
a
denial
of
benefits.
indeed,
he
was
advised
and
instructed
on
how
he
could
improve
his
efforts
to
meet
his
obligations
to
be
eligible
and
he
was
then
paid.
the
department
system
was
certainly
fair
to
him
as
it
is
to
all
claimants.
claimants
here
would
have
us
believe
that
simply
by
registering
with
the
employment
service
and
meeting
the
wage
credit
requirements
that
from
then
on
they
have
a
right
to
keep
on
collecting
without
saying
or
doing
any
more.
this
ignores
the
explicit
requirements
of
the
statutes
that
the
claimants
who
receive
benefits
must
each
week
be
able
to
work
and
make
reasonable
attempts
to
secure
employment.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
he
is
your
honor,
testimony
of
the
office
manager,
one
of
the
local
offices,
there
is
a
deposition
in
the
record,
shows
that
he
says
he
would
like
to
have
a
witness
or
if
he
needs
a
doctor's
certificate
or
something
like
that,
he
is
given
time
to
get
this.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor,
he's
given
this
opportunity.
such
a
right
we
submit
to
benefits
is
at
best
a
conditional
right.
if
i
may
analogize,
this
is
comparable
to
a
man
being
given
a
key
to
an
apartment
building.
he
can
get
into
the
building
but
unless
he
has
keys
to
the
individual
apartments,
he
cannot
get
into
these
apartments.
so,
as
a
man
registers
for
benefits,
registers
for
work
with
the
local
office
and
meets
the
wage
credit
requirements,
this
is
the
key
to
the
building.
but
he
can't
get
into
each
apartment
unless
as
each
week,
he
meets
the
requirements
of
showing
that
he
has
made
reasonable
attempts
to
secure
employment
and
that
he
has
not
restricted
his
availability.
he
is
able
to
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
well,
counsel
may
disagree
with
me
but
that
i
believe
is
correct
your
honor
because
all
of
the
facts
pertaining
to
the
named
claimants
here,
concern
their
efforts
and
their
availability
for
work,
information
which
they
themselves
supply.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
wage
credits,
now
this
has
already
been
determined.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
if
there
is
a
question
on
his
wage
credits,
if
a
question
arises
that
maybe
he
doesn't
have
sufficient
wage
credits,
as
pointed
out
in
the
record,
he
is
given
a
notice
that
there
will
be
a
hearing
at
such
and
such
a
time.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
to
the
commission,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
he
would
your
honor.
as
this
court
recently
said
in
the
arnett
v.
kennedy
case,
property
interests
are
not
created
by
the
constitution,
rather
they
are
created
in
the
dimensions
defined
by
existing
rules
or
understanding
stemming
from
independent
source
such
as
state
law.
this
is
exactly
the
situation
here.
the
connecticut
statutes
which
provide
these
benefits
also
require
an
affirmative
showing
by
the
claimants
each
and
every
week
for
which
they
seek
these
benefits.
that
connecticut's
procedures
do
not
result
on
wholesale
denials
of
benefits,
as
our
opponents
would
have
us
believe.
this
is
pointed
out
by
the
very
financial
condition
that
connecticut
finds
itself
in
now.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
called
and
said
i
cannot
make
my
appointment
today,
i'm
going
on
a
job
interview,
no
problem.
they
would
ask
him
to
call
back
to
tell
whether
or
not
he
did
receive
the
job,
if
he
was
given
a
job
and
if
not,
to
then
come
in
and
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
well,
the
day
that
he
comes,
while
some
of
them
may
spend
a
good
part
of
the
day
there,
the
procedures
are
scheduled
so
that
he
does
not
spend
the
whole
day
there.
in
fact,
if
the
policy
works
correctly,
they
expect
the
individual
to
come
dressed
to
seek
work,
if
in
fact
they
happen
to
have
the
referral
the
day
he
comes
in
for
his
interview.
so
they
do
not
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
that
may
be
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
not
exactly.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
on
may
1st
of
1969,
connecticut
had
in
its
unemployment
compensation
benefit
fund,
over
$298
million.
this
fund
has
been
depleted
to
the
point
where
we
are
now
in
debt
to
the
us
government
$62
million
and
this
doesn't
count
the
approximately
$65
million
at
stake
and
in
each
year
from
the
employers
who
are
being
taxed.
further,
there
are
estimates
showing
that
we
will
have
to
borrow
in
1975
and
1976
even
though
the
maximum
tax
rate
on
the
employers
has
gone
from
2.9
last
year
to
5.0
this
year
and
will
go
to
5.9
next
year.
in
conclusion,
i
will
simply
say
that
these
claimants
have
all
received
benefits
form
the
very
system
that
they're
challenging.
they
are
very
happy
with
connecticut's
informal
hearing
when
it
expeditiously
awards
them
benefits
but
they
are
unhappy
when
the
same
procedures
result
in
a
denial
of
benefits
for
one
or
two
weeks.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
at
the
present
time
your
honor,
yes.
there
is
longer
than
we
would
like
to
have
delay
period
but
again
i
would
point
out
this
is
due
to
the
number
of
appeals
and
backlog
of
being
redundant,
backlog
of
cases.
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
a
separate
entities,
unemployment
commission
adheres
these
cases.
they
are
not
a
defendant
in
this
case.
plus
this
is
subsequent
to
a
hearing
which
we
believe
meets
due
process
requirements,
therefore
it's
not
relevant.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
believe
steinberg
was
cut
off
and
he
--
although
he
received
26
weeks,
there
were
extended
benefits
at
that
time
and
he
obtained
a
job
for
a
short
period
of
time
and
then
went
back,
and
i
believe
he
started
receiving
benefits
again
after
a
short
period
of
time.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
couldn't
answer
the
percentage
rate.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
believe
it
is
your
honor,
yes.
it's
an
industrialized
state.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
pardon
your
honor,
six
minutes
do
you
say?
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court,
just
a
few
items
in
rebuttal.
first,
counsel
has
brought
up
the
affidavits
of
the
mrs.
triana
and
mr.
miranda
whereby
mrs.
triana
indicates
that
she
never
had
an
interpreter
and
was
never
given
any
information
as
to
her
rights.
there
was
a
counter
affidavit
and
you
can
find
this
at
page
145
(a)
of
the
appendix
of
a
spanish
speaking
interpreter
used
in
this
office
who
testified
that
she
gave
two
benefit
rights
interviews
to
this
individual
and
did
interpret
for
her.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
actual
testimony
before
it
from
these
individuals
but
just
these
affidavits.
so
far
as
the
statement
about
mr.
miranda
and
his
affidavit
saying
that
he
was
denied
benefits
because
he
had
an
appeal
pending,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out.
this
is
against
departmental
policy.
well,
this
does
not
make
the
system
wrong,
the
system
is
alright,
as
he
points
out,
this
was
against
departmental
policy.
all
systems
have
people
problems.
this
is
why
we
have
so
many
memos.
you
can
see
from
many
memos
and
department
policy
letters
sent
by
the
department
that
they
are
anxious
to
see
that
its
employees
do
administer
the
system
correctly.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
think
there
is
evidence
in
the
records,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
believe
in
the
bridgeport
office,
at
the
time
the
deposition
was
taken,
i
think
there
were
40
employees
in
that
office,
that's
one
of
the
large
offices.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
they
have
offices
in
the
major
counties,
there
would
be
at
least,
i
believe
four
major
offices
and
in
peak
periods
of
unemployment
they
open
subsidiary
offices
in
the
county
where
the
people
can
file
their
claims.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
the
department
has
information
as
to
what
a
labor
market
consists
of
geographically
and
a
person
would
not
be
required
to
travel
outside
of
that
labor
market
to
seek
employment.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
he
does
not
your
honor.
it's
reasonable,
what
could
reasonably
be
expected
of
the
individual.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
within
his
labor
market,
yes.
certainly
as
he
--
there
is
policy
that
as
the
man
receives
benefits,
the
longer
he
receives
benefits,
perhaps
the
wider
he
should
make
a
search
for
work
and
reduce
his
level
of
what
he's
seeking.
in
other
words,
we
have
case
law
that
says
he
can
look
for
a
job
as
comparable
as
possible
to
his
skills
and
income
that
he
had
before
he
was
laid
off.
but
the
more
he
goes
on
unemployed,
then
he
may
have
to
lower
the
extensions.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
or
widen
his
scope
of
search
area.
the
question
on
third
party
information,
counsel
has
overlooked
the
point
that
when
third
party
information
is
used,
the
claimant
is
given
the
opportunity
to
reflect
this
information.
and
if
there
is
a
contradictory
statement,
there
is
a
statutory
presumption
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
and
i
would
also
add
that
the
minimal
aspect
that
importance
that
counsel
will
give
on
the
governmental
interest
here
is
not
just
the
money
that's
in
the
fund,
although
i
would
point
out
that
this
affects
of
course
the
employers
who
are
taxed
and
indirectly
it
concerns
the
employees
in
the
whole
state.
but
it
also
concerns
the
administrative
efficiency
of
the
local
officers.
they
schedule
a
certain
number
of
claimants
that
they
can
handle
each
day
and
so
they
must
expeditiously
handle
these
claims
if
we
had
to
have
a
so-called
due
process
hearing
where
every
time
a
question
arose
as
to
a
man's
efforts.
they
could
not
handle
the
tremendous
number
of
claimants
who
are
coming
in
each
week,
there
are
some
40,000
claims
a
week
during
the
period
and
issue
that's
in
the
record.
i
would
simply
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
was
correct
in
affirming
the
torres
dinger
decision
and
i
have
the
opportunity
now
to
distinguish
unemployment
compensation
cases
and
welfare
cases
by
finding
that
connecticut's
procedures
do
satisfy
due
process
requirements.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
class
action
suit
concerns
the
adequacy
of
connecticut's
administrative
procedures
which
i
used
to
determine
weekly
claims
for
unemployment
compensation.
a
three-judge
district
court
had
before
it
two
issues.
one,
do
the
connecticut
procedures
violate
the
so-called
when
due
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
and
two,
do
they
violate
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
lower
court
found
that
there
was
no
statutory
violation
but
did
rule
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
since
the
district
court
found
no
statutory
violation
and
because
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
decision
by
the
claimants,
this
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
therefore
the
only
statement
on
the
merits
of
this
issue
which
has
been
raised
in
my
opponent's
brief
is
that
the
lower
court
and
the
court
in
the
torres,
the
decisions
were
correct
in
ruling
that
where
a
decision
is
made,
that
the
claimant
is
not
eligible
for
benefits,
obviously
then
no
benefits
are
due
and
therefore
the
when
due
provision
cannot
be
violated.
the
issues
that
are
here
are
one,
whether
connecticut's
administrative
hearing
which
employs
a
seated
interview
system
meets
due
process
requirements.
and
two,
whether
the
district
court
in
determining
this
first
issue
erred
in
receiving
in
considering
evidence
which
relates
to
the
appeal
period
subsequent
to
the
hearing
in
question.
facts
generally
here
concern
individuals
who
have
filed
an
initial
application
for
benefits.
they
have
satisfied
the
department
that
they
have
registered
for
work
with
the
employment
service
and
that
they
have
met
the
wage
credits
requirement
of
the
statute.
in
other
words
they
have
enough
earned
wages
from
a
former
employer
prior
to
their
unemployment.
these
people
then
go
on
a
bi-weekly
basis
to
the
local
office
where
they
submit
a
form
showing
where
they
have
gone
to
seek
work
during
the
past
two
weeks.
now
although
they
go
every
two
weeks,
statutes
require
a
determination
each
week
as
to
eligibility.
when
they
go
to
this
interviewer,
the
interviewer
usually
will
ask
some
questions
such
as
“did
you
earn
any
wages
during
this
two-week
period?
were
you
able
to
work
during
this
period?”
he
will
look
at
the
form.
if
it
seems
as
though
he
has
made
reasonable
efforts
during
that
week,
he
will
receive
his
check.
if
a
question
is
raised
by
what
the
claimant
says
or
what
is
in
that
form,
the
claimant
is
then
referred
to
another
interviewer
behind
the
counter.
this
is
the
fact-finding
examiner
who
will
then
go
into
greater
detail
in
discussing
with
the
claimant
what
efforts
he
has
made
to
seek
work
during
those
two
weeks
just
ended.
now,
that
basically
is
the
situation
that
is
before
us.
and
as
you
can
see,
this
situation
is
far
different
from
that
in
goldberg
against
kelly.
the
claimant
here
actually
presents
his
case
to
the
decision
maker.
this
was
the
“fatal
flaw”
which
was
found
in
the
goldberg
case.
he
is
heard.
in
the
welfare
cases,
generally
the
recipient
only
has
to
establish
need
at
the
initial
proceedings
when
he
first
applies.
he
then
proceeds
to
be
paid
unless
and
until
his
status
changes.
in
unemployment
compensation
cases,
not
only
is
there
no
needs
test
but
the
statutes
providing
for
these
benefits
also
require
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
each
claimant
to
each
week
qualify
for
benefits.
now,
would
our
connecticut's
procedures,
which
we
submit
meet
due
process
requirements?
first,
what
do
we
mean
by
due
process?
we
submit
the
essence
of
due
process
is
fairness,
considering
all
the
relevant
factors,
are
connecticut's
procedures
fair?
let
us
see.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
exactly
that
your
honor.
in
connecticut
the
claimant
has
notice
of
the
interview.
when
he
first
applies,
he
is
given
a
booklet
that
is
entitled
“your
rights
and
responsibilities,”
under
the
connecticut
unemployment
compensation
law.
as
the
name
implies,
the
claimant
has
responsibilities.
not
the
first
of
which
is
to
read
this
booklet
which
not
only
tells
him
what
his
obligations
are
but
gives
him
helpful
information
as
to
how
he
can
meet
these
obligations.
more
importantly,
these
claimants
are
experienced.
all
of
the
named
claimants
in
this
case
receive
benefits
for
varying
periods
of
time.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no
your
honor
because
the
claimant
--
except
in
the
booklet
itself,
he
knows
that
he
has
to
show
where
and
when
he
went
to
seek
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
we
can't,
we
don't
know
ourselves
until
he
appears.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
only
we
try
to,
that
that's
--
well
i
won't
say
it's
rare.
this
is
why
he
registers
with
the
employment
service.
the
employment
service
tries
to
establish
referrals
and
when
we
learn
that
this
man
might
be
suited
for
this
job
and
there
is
an
opening,
he
is
referred.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor
but
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
can
bring
anybody
he
wants
as
a
witness,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
well
your
honor,
if
the
claimant
has
been
receiving
benefits,
he
already
by
his
experience,
knows
what
he
must
do
to
collect
those
benefits,
therefore,
during
that
two-week
period,
if
he
knows
that
instead
of
going
out
looking
for
a
job
for
three
days,
he
was
out
fishing,
he
knows
unless
he
gets
off
his
button
and
looks
those
last
two
days,
there’s
going
to
be
a
question
as
to
what
efforts
he
made.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
not
necessarily
but
certainly
he's
going
to
be
questioned
as
to
what
efforts
he's
made.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
but
we
have
no
information.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
there
are
no
charges
made.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
he
did
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
that
he
did
search
for
work
and
that
he
was
not
restricting
his
availability
to
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
excuse
me
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
the
word
guilty
has
a
connotation
which
is
not
applicable
in
this
case,
i
submit
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
has
failed
to
meet
his
responsibilities
as
outlined
by
the
statutes
and
by
the
booklet
he
receives,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
that's
right.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
he
starts
off
by
showing
that
he's
registered
for
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
but
he
also
must
show
that
he
has
looked
for
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
excuse
me
your
honor,
he's
not
charged
with
not
having
found
work.
he
may
be
charged,
if
i
may
use
that
term
and
i
don't
like
it.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
it
is
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
efforts
that
he
made
to
seek
work
are
not
reasonable,
there's
quite
a
difference
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
the
booklet
itself.
he
must
make
reasonable
efforts
to
find
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
well
it's
defined
in
the
booklet
your
honor,
for
his
benefit.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
but
this
is
a
standard
that's
applied
throughout
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no
he
doesn't
have
to
explain
why,
your
honor.
if
he
has
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
has
a
form
which
shows
where
he
went
to
seek
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
they
will
ask
him,
where
did
you
go
to
look
for
work?
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
if
he
fails
to
answer,
he
will
be
denied
benefits.
the
statutes
and
the
booklet
tell
him
he
must
make
efforts.
and
if
he
doesn't
communicate
those
efforts
to
us,
how
can
we
pay
him
benefits?
this
is
a
trust
fund
that
the
administrator
as
a
fiduciary
must
administer
with
reasonable
diligence.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
your
honor,
say
burden
of
proof
but
certainly
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
the
burden
is
on
him
to
show
eligibility,
the
statutes
require
this.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
he
would
not
have
satisfied
the
basic
requirement
of
giving
us
information
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
in
fact,
the
plaintiff
steinberg
collected
for
26
consecutive
weeks
and
he
was
advised
at
this
seated
interview,
more
than
one
seated
interview
that
he
had
better
improved
his
efforts
to
find
work.
don't
restrict
yourself
to
making
contacts
with
the
local
union
hawk,
but
he
did
and
finally
he
was
denied
benefits.
sure
because
he
didn't
meet
the
--
he
didn't
heed
the
advice
given
to
him
that
he
has
to
make
efforts,
reasonable
efforts.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
there
is
a
rule
of
thumb,
it's
not
followed
categorically.
again,
it
prints,
the
lower
court
says,
give
them
in
advance
a
certain
number
of
places
to
go.
well
this
just
wouldn't
work
out.
if
you
required
somebody
who
is
looking
for
a
waiter's
job
to
go
to
10
places,
this
might
be
reasonable.
but
a
professor
of
some
university
was
out
of
a
job,
there
are
just
so
many
places
he
can
go
and
you
can't
require
him
to
go
to
10
places.
what
is
reasonable
for
the
individual?
each
case
has
to
be
determined
on
its
own
merits.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
for
the
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
for
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
if
they
--
during
this
period
when
they're
using
this
form,
the
examiners
at
the
counter,
if
they
went
through
three
places
in
one
week,
for
a
each
week
then
they
were
given
their
check,
there
were
no
questions
raised.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
think
it
was,
your
honor,
i
can't
say
that
everybody,
that
each
examiner
knew
that.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
can't
speak
for
what's
in
the
mind
of
the
beneficiaries
but
i
would
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
think
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
think
it
was
common
knowledge
that
if
they
--
the
form
had
six
places
for
the
two
week
period
and
if
they
filled
out.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
like
to
see
more
lines
actually.
now
the
claimant
does
have
notice
of
the
issues.
the
lower
court
either
deliberately
ignored
or
completely
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
issue
is
not
known
to
the
department
employee
until
the
claimant
appears.
the
claimant
however
knows
what
he's
done
regarding
his
own
efforts,
whether
or
not
he
has
restricted
himself,
his
rest
to
hours
or
conditions
of
employment.
thus
he
alone
knows
before
the
hearing
takes
place
what
issues
might
be
raised?
the
claimant
has
an
opportunity
to
present
witnesses.
now
in
the
majority
of
the
cases
certainly
there
simply
are
no
witnesses.
the
decision
is
based
on
the
facts
given
by
the
claimant
himself.
there
were
not
witnesses
in
the
steinberg
case
nor
were
there
any
witnesses
in
any
of
the
cases
of
the
named
claimants
in
this
action.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
at
the
seated
interview,
your
honor.
if
the
claimant
should
need
a
witness,
the
record
shows
that
he
has
given
time
to
obtain
one.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no
your
honor,
no.
it
might
--
if
he
were
ill
for
one
or
two
days,
then
the
latter
part
of
that
week,
he
made
sufficient
efforts,
reasonable
efforts,
he
will
probably
be
paid.
but
if
the
man
is
sick
for
let's
say
four
days
out
of
the
week,
the
statute
says
that
he
must
be
physically
and
mentally
able
to
work.
he
would
not
meet
that
requirement.
therefore
he
would
not
receive
benefits
for
that
week.
the
philosophy
behind
this
unemployment
compensation
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
he
has
to
--
right
and
to
look
for.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
thank
you.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
emphasize
that
the
interviews
in
question
here
are
not
contests
between
the
department
employee
and
the
claimant.
the
employee
is
a
neutral
party.
he
is
just
gathering
the
facts.
he
has
no
interest,
there's
no
money
coming
out
of
his
own
pocket
here.
there
are
no
charges
or
any
defenses
that
the
claimant
has
to
meet
or
make.
all
he
has
to
do
is
tell
it
like
it
is
or
was
the
past
two
weeks.
the
steinberg
situation
shows
that
the
seated
interviews
do
not
always
result
in
a
denial
of
benefits.
indeed,
he
was
advised
and
instructed
on
how
he
could
improve
his
efforts
to
meet
his
obligations
to
be
eligible
and
he
was
then
paid.
the
department
system
was
certainly
fair
to
him
as
it
is
to
all
claimants.
claimants
here
would
have
us
believe
that
simply
by
registering
with
the
employment
service
and
meeting
the
wage
credit
requirements
that
from
then
on
they
have
a
right
to
keep
on
collecting
without
saying
or
doing
any
more.
this
ignores
the
explicit
requirements
of
the
statutes
that
the
claimants
who
receive
benefits
must
each
week
be
able
to
work
and
make
reasonable
attempts
to
secure
employment.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
he
is
your
honor,
testimony
of
the
office
manager,
one
of
the
local
offices,
there
is
a
deposition
in
the
record,
shows
that
he
says
he
would
like
to
have
a
witness
or
if
he
needs
a
doctor's
certificate
or
something
like
that,
he
is
given
time
to
get
this.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor,
he's
given
this
opportunity.
such
a
right
we
submit
to
benefits
is
at
best
a
conditional
right.
if
i
may
analogize,
this
is
comparable
to
a
man
being
given
a
key
to
an
apartment
building.
he
can
get
into
the
building
but
unless
he
has
keys
to
the
individual
apartments,
he
cannot
get
into
these
apartments.
so,
as
a
man
registers
for
benefits,
registers
for
work
with
the
local
office
and
meets
the
wage
credit
requirements,
this
is
the
key
to
the
building.
but
he
can't
get
into
each
apartment
unless
as
each
week,
he
meets
the
requirements
of
showing
that
he
has
made
reasonable
attempts
to
secure
employment
and
that
he
has
not
restricted
his
availability.
he
is
able
to
work.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
well,
counsel
may
disagree
with
me
but
that
i
believe
is
correct
your
honor
because
all
of
the
facts
pertaining
to
the
named
claimants
here,
concern
their
efforts
and
their
availability
for
work,
information
which
they
themselves
supply.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
wage
credits,
now
this
has
already
been
determined.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
if
there
is
a
question
on
his
wage
credits,
if
a
question
arises
that
maybe
he
doesn't
have
sufficient
wage
credits,
as
pointed
out
in
the
record,
he
is
given
a
notice
that
there
will
be
a
hearing
at
such
and
such
a
time.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
to
the
commission,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
he
would
your
honor.
as
this
court
recently
said
in
the
arnett
v.
kennedy
case,
property
interests
are
not
created
by
the
constitution,
rather
they
are
created
in
the
dimensions
defined
by
existing
rules
or
understanding
stemming
from
independent
source
such
as
state
law.
this
is
exactly
the
situation
here.
the
connecticut
statutes
which
provide
these
benefits
also
require
an
affirmative
showing
by
the
claimants
each
and
every
week
for
which
they
seek
these
benefits.
that
connecticut's
procedures
do
not
result
on
wholesale
denials
of
benefits,
as
our
opponents
would
have
us
believe.
this
is
pointed
out
by
the
very
financial
condition
that
connecticut
finds
itself
in
now.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
called
and
said
i
cannot
make
my
appointment
today,
i'm
going
on
a
job
interview,
no
problem.
they
would
ask
him
to
call
back
to
tell
whether
or
not
he
did
receive
the
job,
if
he
was
given
a
job
and
if
not,
to
then
come
in
and
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
well,
the
day
that
he
comes,
while
some
of
them
may
spend
a
good
part
of
the
day
there,
the
procedures
are
scheduled
so
that
he
does
not
spend
the
whole
day
there.
in
fact,
if
the
policy
works
correctly,
they
expect
the
individual
to
come
dressed
to
seek
work,
if
in
fact
they
happen
to
have
the
referral
the
day
he
comes
in
for
his
interview.
so
they
do
not
--
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
that
may
be
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
not
exactly.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
on
may
1st
of
1969,
connecticut
had
in
its
unemployment
compensation
benefit
fund,
over
$298
million.
this
fund
has
been
depleted
to
the
point
where
we
are
now
in
debt
to
the
us
government
$62
million
and
this
doesn't
count
the
approximately
$65
million
at
stake
and
in
each
year
from
the
employers
who
are
being
taxed.
further,
there
are
estimates
showing
that
we
will
have
to
borrow
in
1975
and
1976
even
though
the
maximum
tax
rate
on
the
employers
has
gone
from
2.9
last
year
to
5.0
this
year
and
will
go
to
5.9
next
year.
in
conclusion,
i
will
simply
say
that
these
claimants
have
all
received
benefits
form
the
very
system
that
they're
challenging.
they
are
very
happy
with
connecticut's
informal
hearing
when
it
expeditiously
awards
them
benefits
but
they
are
unhappy
when
the
same
procedures
result
in
a
denial
of
benefits
for
one
or
two
weeks.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
at
the
present
time
your
honor,
yes.
there
is
longer
than
we
would
like
to
have
delay
period
but
again
i
would
point
out
this
is
due
to
the
number
of
appeals
and
backlog
of
being
redundant,
backlog
of
cases.
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
a
separate
entities,
unemployment
commission
adheres
these
cases.
they
are
not
a
defendant
in
this
case.
plus
this
is
subsequent
to
a
hearing
which
we
believe
meets
due
process
requirements,
therefore
it's
not
relevant.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
believe
steinberg
was
cut
off
and
he
--
although
he
received
26
weeks,
there
were
extended
benefits
at
that
time
and
he
obtained
a
job
for
a
short
period
of
time
and
then
went
back,
and
i
believe
he
started
receiving
benefits
again
after
a
short
period
of
time.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
yes
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
couldn't
answer
the
percentage
rate.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
believe
it
is
your
honor,
yes.
it's
an
industrialized
state.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
pardon
your
honor,
six
minutes
do
you
say?
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court,
just
a
few
items
in
rebuttal.
first,
counsel
has
brought
up
the
affidavits
of
the
mrs.
triana
and
mr.
miranda
whereby
mrs.
triana
indicates
that
she
never
had
an
interpreter
and
was
never
given
any
information
as
to
her
rights.
there
was
a
counter
affidavit
and
you
can
find
this
at
page
145
(a)
of
the
appendix
of
a
spanish
speaking
interpreter
used
in
this
office
who
testified
that
she
gave
two
benefit
rights
interviews
to
this
individual
and
did
interpret
for
her.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
actual
testimony
before
it
from
these
individuals
but
just
these
affidavits.
so
far
as
the
statement
about
mr.
miranda
and
his
affidavit
saying
that
he
was
denied
benefits
because
he
had
an
appeal
pending,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out.
this
is
against
departmental
policy.
well,
this
does
not
make
the
system
wrong,
the
system
is
alright,
as
he
points
out,
this
was
against
departmental
policy.
all
systems
have
people
problems.
this
is
why
we
have
so
many
memos.
you
can
see
from
many
memos
and
department
policy
letters
sent
by
the
department
that
they
are
anxious
to
see
that
its
employees
do
administer
the
system
correctly.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
think
there
is
evidence
in
the
records,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
i
believe
in
the
bridgeport
office,
at
the
time
the
deposition
was
taken,
i
think
there
were
40
employees
in
that
office,
that's
one
of
the
large
offices.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
they
have
offices
in
the
major
counties,
there
would
be
at
least,
i
believe
four
major
offices
and
in
peak
periods
of
unemployment
they
open
subsidiary
offices
in
the
county
where
the
people
can
file
their
claims.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
the
department
has
information
as
to
what
a
labor
market
consists
of
geographically
and
a
person
would
not
be
required
to
travel
outside
of
that
labor
market
to
seek
employment.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
no,
he
does
not
your
honor.
it's
reasonable,
what
could
reasonably
be
expected
of
the
individual.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
within
his
labor
market,
yes.
certainly
as
he
--
there
is
policy
that
as
the
man
receives
benefits,
the
longer
he
receives
benefits,
perhaps
the
wider
he
should
make
a
search
for
work
and
reduce
his
level
of
what
he's
seeking.
in
other
words,
we
have
case
law
that
says
he
can
look
for
a
job
as
comparable
as
possible
to
his
skills
and
income
that
he
had
before
he
was
laid
off.
but
the
more
he
goes
on
unemployed,
then
he
may
have
to
lower
the
extensions.
mr.
donald
e.
wasik
or
widen
his
scope
of
search
area.
the
question
on
third
party
information,
counsel
has
overlooked
the
point
that
when
third
party
information
is
used,
the
claimant
is
given
the
opportunity
to
reflect
this
information.
and
if
there
is
a
contradictory
statement,
there
is
a
statutory
presumption
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
and
i
would
also
add
that
the
minimal
aspect
that
importance
that
counsel
will
give
on
the
governmental
interest
here
is
not
just
the
money
that's
in
the
fund,
although
i
would
point
out
that
this
affects
of
course
the
employers
who
are
taxed
and
indirectly
it
concerns
the
employees
in
the
whole
state.
but
it
also
concerns
the
administrative
efficiency
of
the
local
officers.
they
schedule
a
certain
number
of
claimants
that
they
can
handle
each
day
and
so
they
must
expeditiously
handle
these
claims
if
we
had
to
have
a
so-called
due
process
hearing
where
every
time
a
question
arose
as
to
a
man's
efforts.
they
could
not
handle
the
tremendous
number
of
claimants
who
are
coming
in
each
week,
there
are
some
40,000
claims
a
week
during
the
period
and
issue
that's
in
the
record.
i
would
simply
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
was
correct
in
affirming
the
torres
dinger
decision
and
i
have
the
opportunity
now
to
distinguish
unemployment
compensation
cases
and
welfare
cases
by
finding
that
connecticut's
procedures
do
satisfy
due
process
requirements.
