justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
year,
he
is
given
no
notice
of
what's
to
be
discussed,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
no,
they
don't
tell
him
that
we
know
you
didn't
do
it
or
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he's
not
allowed
to
go
outside
the
record
at
all.
is
he
allowed
to
bring
anybody
in
as
a
witness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
he
know
whether
he
can
bring
the
witness
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is,
if
he
doesn't
get
a
job,
he
knows
he's
going
in
there
until
somebody
going
to
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
doesn't
know
what
information
is
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
was
he
charged
with
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
does
he
have
to
come
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right,
he
has
the
burden.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he's
guilty
or
not
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
a
moment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he's
guilty
of
not
having
found
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
give
me
a
better
word.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
failed
to
meet
the
eligibility
requirements
to
obtain
the
relief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
starts
off
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
does
he
come
in
there,
because
he
hadn't
found
work?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
comes
in
there
charged
with
not
having
found
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
give
me
a
better
word
than
charge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
pointed
out
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
as
an
ordinary
layman
knows
what
reasonable
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
trouble
with
the
word
reasonable?
don't
we
have
trouble
with
it
about
eight
or
10
times
a
week?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
know
but
this
man
comes
in,
automatically,
he
has
to
explain
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
comes
in,
he
says
nothing,
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
comes
in
and
says
nothing,
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
doesn't
answer,
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wasik,
would
it
be
a
good
excuse
for
not
attending
one
of
these
hearings
if
the
man
says
i'm
not
getting
a
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
just
wondering
you'd
take
one
of
five
days
part
of
his
job
seeking,
to
sit
around
and
talk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
different
from
any
other
place
i
hace
ever
seen
in
my
life,
and
sit
around
all
day
usually
waiting
for
your
name
to
be
called.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
different
in
connecticut?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
shouldn't
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
creane,
can
i
back
up
a
bit,
what
type
of
notice
do
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
case.
the
authorities
know
nothing
of
what
happened
last
week
with
applicant
a
and
he
is
coming
in
for
a
weekly
seated
conference.
what
notice
do
you
give
him,
do
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
issue
at
that
stage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
does
he
need
notice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
want
notice
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whatever
will
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he
comes
in
and
he
says
“i
have
spent
the
last
week
on
the
beach.
now,
i
haven't
looked
for
a
job.”
now,
does
he
need
notice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
the
notice
be
that
you
didn't
look
for
work
last
week.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
the
way
it
was
argued
yesterday.
i
understood
that
you
come
in
every
week
and
you
tell
them
what
you
have
done
to
look
for
a
job.
justice
