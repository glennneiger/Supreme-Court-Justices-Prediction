justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
would
have
a
different
--
you
perhaps
wouldn't
be
here
at
all
if
the
termination,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
was
for
another
reason,
was
for
a
continuing
reason
that
was
ascertainable
at
the
outset.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
were
a
question
of
the
wage
credits.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
already
been
determined,
what
if
you
suddenly
redetermined
it
to
cut
him
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
answer
is,
you
think
the
rule
would
be
different
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wasik
there
is
something
in
the
briefs
about
taking
three
months
for
an
appeal
to
be
resolved.
is
this
the
usual
experience?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
person
cut
off
for
not
making
efforts
to
find
work
and
make
efforts
the
next
week
and
get
reinstated
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
were
some
of
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
117
(a)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
that
this
system
has
the
sit-down
interviews,
so
called
and
followed
by
a
full
hearing
if
the
person
wants
one
at
some
time
in
the
future.
what
do
you
think
the
standard
is
that
you're
pushing
for
that
should
be
followed
before
refusal
or
before
suspension?
do
you
think
it's
a
probable
cause
basis
or
a
final
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
the
answer
to
my
question,
do
you
think
that
the
hearing
and
the
hearing
that
you're
pushing
forward
should
be
designed
not
just
to
determine
probable
cause
pending
a
full
hearing
but
to
finally
conclude
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
if
there's
a
later
full
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
think
that
if
--
wouldn't
you
think
that,
or
would
you,
that
if
the
probable
--
if
all
that
was
to
be
required
prior
determination,
if
that's
what
this
is
to
be
called
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
is
un-qualified.
would
you
think
the
sit
down
interview
would
be
satisfactory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
don't
even
need
that
to
arrest
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
even
need
that
to
arrest
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
chance
to
litigate
about
probable
cause
before
a
magistrate.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
say
that
there's
no
account
of
it
because
50%
they
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
50/50
chance
so
you
don't
get
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
any
way
don't
say
there
isn't
any
account
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standard
is
governing,
probable
cause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standards
is
governing,
probable
cause
or
(inaudible).
on
that
recognized
probable
cause
or
as
a
pre-suspension
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
when
a
claimant
first
arrives
at
the
office,
he
has
never
been
asked
for
unemployment
compensation
report.
he
has
to
show
his
qualification,
i
take
it
including
the
fact
that
he
has
been
hunting
for
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
does
your
compensation
start?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
show
by
then
at
that
next
meeting,
you
show
what
efforts
you've
been
making
to
find
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
one
of
the
qualifying
reasons.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
alright.
do
you
think
that
if
he
first
arrives,
he
shows
out
his
papers
and
then
he
has
this
next
meeting
you
speak
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
point,
what
happens
at
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
does
he
explain
what
he's
been
doing
or
does
he
fill
out
another
piece
of
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
compensation
doesn't
start
until
at
some
point
he's
demonstrated
that
he's
made
some
efforts.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
let's
assume
that
he
fills
out
his
slip
showing
what
efforts
he
has
made
and
it
isn't
satisfactory.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
that
your
argument
would
apply
to
that
situation
too,
to
the
start
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
would
have
a
different
--
you
