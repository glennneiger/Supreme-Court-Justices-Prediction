just
as
somewhere
in

in

brief,
there
is
some
time
ago
and
then
i
think
suggested
and
then
denied
that
there’s
some
sort
of
a
rule
of
thumb
that
if
a
person
is
made
to

justice

stewart
but
there
is
a
rule
of
thumb
--
justice

stewart
for
the
ordinary
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
that,
how
many?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
pretty
well
known?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
among
the
beneficiaries,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
just
wonder
if
there
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
common
knowledge.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
pretty
good
indicator.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
if
a
person
had
been
held
for
the
two-week
period,
i
assume
that
that
under
regulations
and
the
statute
would
excuse
him
from
actively
seeking
work,
it's
true
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
you
have
to
be
ready
when
you
go
to
work.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
note
that
kind
of
temporary
illness.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
condition
of
your

and
that
the
state
of
the

lies
in
the
fields,
so
that
many
wives
reflect
unusually
high
unemployment
rate
in
connecticut?
justice

what's
it
running
to?
justice

mr.

what's
the

this
was
my
question
and

what
is
the

of
this
to
your
argument

your
position
in

it
is

i

you
agree
with
your

a
rule
of

as

pointed
out
yesterday
if
you
are

it's

well
the
standard
is
in

that's
given
to

isn't
it?
justice

that
is

reasonable
of
a

how

geographically,
how
