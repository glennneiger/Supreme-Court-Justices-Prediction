chief

warren
e.

there
something
said
about

warren
e.

given
you
a
very
good
opening
on
the
subject
suppose
you
address
yourself
to
that
question
briefly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
counsel
suppose
we
hear
from
your
friend

reserve
some
time
for

that's
seems
desirable
to
you?
mr.
tuttle.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose

into
account
that
he
is
been
in
prison
for
two
years

more
already.
chief

e.
burger
i
suppose
you're
suggesting
that
any
alert
defense
counsel
in
those
circumstances
would
have
insisted

an
unqualified

force
a
verdict
of
not

e.
burger

submit
on
briefs
on

counsel
unless

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
speaking
of
an
established
procedure
that
whenever

threats
come
to
the
notice
of
local
police
they
are
required
--
refer
them
to
the
fbi
and
the
secret
service?
isn't
there
something
in
the
report
of
the
warren
commission
on
president
kennedy's
assassination
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
crime
could
he
have
been
arrested
for
