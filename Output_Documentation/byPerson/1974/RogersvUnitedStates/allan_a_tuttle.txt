mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
has
indicated
this
is
a
prosecution
under
18
u.s.c.
871,
threatening
a
life
of
the
president.
the
arguments
of
counsel
on
appeal
have
been
principally
that
the
threats
uttered
were
not
true
threats
or
that
the
trial
court
misconceived
the
statute
or
finally
that
if
the
trial
court
did
not
misconceived
the
statute,
the
statute
as
applied
violated
the
first
amendment.
we
disagree
with
all
of
these
contentions.
we
believe
that
the
threat
was
true
threat.
we
believe
the
trial
court's
instruction
was
correct
and
we
believe
that
the
statute
as
applied
did
not
offend
the
first
amendment.
however,
as
the
court
has
raise
in
questions
now,
there
are
some
procedural
difficulties
with
this
conviction
which
might
justify
this
court
in
reversing
the
conviction.
however,
i
would
stress
that
these
procedural
problems
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
evidence
before
the
jury,
the
instructions
or
the
law
on
the
merits.
in
order
to
understand
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
procedural
problem
that
arose,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
in
just
a
few
words
some
of
the
facts
of
the
circumstances
and
the
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial.
i
want
to
elaborate
on
that
because
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
although
for
instance
it
is
true
that
mr.
rogers
had
a
history
of
alcoholism,
every
witness
testifying
on
the
matter
at
trial
with
respect
today
in
question
testified
that
mr.
rogers
was
not
drunk
at
the
time
he
made
the
statements
in
question.
moreover,
there
was
expert
testimony
at
trial
from
a
qualified
psychiatrist
as
to
the
competence
of
mr.
rogers
at
the
time
he
made
the
statements.
i'd
also
like
to
stress
that
the
record
is
replete
with
threats
to
kill
the
president,
to
take
the
life
of
the
president.
there
are
counts
in
which
mr.
rogers
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
they
were
made
to
both,
mr.
justice.
i
can
give
you
record
citations
for
killings
as
for
threats
of
killing
as
they
were
made
to
private
individuals.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
said
he
was
going
to
do
that
in
washington
dc.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
was
in
shreveport.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that's
no
question,
it's
a
little
way.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
also
true
that
the
president
travels
in
many
directions
and
goes
to
many
states.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
if
there
is
a
knowledge
of
the
threat
and
if
the
secret
service
has
adequate
advanced
information
they
would
take
precautions.
but
i
do
suggest
that
the
president
travels
widely.
i
suggest
for
instance
that
shreveport
is
not
very
far
from
dallas.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
said
that
and
i
construe
that
as
meaning
that
he
was
going
to
hitchhike
because
in
the
statement
to
the
police
officer.
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
hitchhike
to
washington
and
later
on
the
same
officer
testified
he
said
he
was
going
to
walk.
in
his
conversations
with
a
customer
mr.
buchanan,
he
asked
about
hitchhiking
and
i
construe
those
words
to
mean
hitchhiking.
although,
in
fact,
he
did
say
he
was
going
to
walk.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
police
did
in
fact
take
him
into
custody,
mr.
justice.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
on
that.
the
testimony
of
the
arresting
officer
is
somewhat
at
variance
with
the
testimony
of
the
detective
at
the
police
station.
the
arresting
officer
testified
that
he
was
taken
to
the
veterans
administration
hospital
and
had
a
pull
placed
on
him
which
merely
means
that
the
hospital
attendants
would
notify
the
police
at
the
time
he
was
to
be
released.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no
charge
was
lodged
against
him
although
the
shreveport
police
did
notify
the
secret
service
of
the
fact
of
this
threat
and
it
was
on
at
the
behalf
of
the
secret
service
that
mr.
rogers
was
then
arrested.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
can
only
testify
--
i
can
only
recount
what
the
record
states.
the
record
states
that
no
charge
was
lodged
against
him.
now,
that
may
have
been
an
inference
on
the
part
of
the
police
that
no
louisiana
law
was
violated
or
it
may
have
been
a
feeling
on
the
part
of
louisiana
police
that
the
crime
if
any
was
not
a
crime
against
the
state
of
louisiana
and
if
it
was
to
be
punished,
it
should
be
punish
by
the
federal
authorities.
again,
i
wish
to
stress
that
in
many
--
in
several
of
these
conversations
there
were
in
fact
threats
to
kill
the
president
and
they
were
unconditional
threats
at
least
in
the
words
given.
when
the
police
officer
inquired
about
the
question
whether
there
have
been
threats,
the
defendant
rogers
again
made
a
threat
to
kill
the
president
saying,
“i'm
going
to
washington,
i'm
going
to
beat
his
ass
off
better
yet
i'm
going
to
kill
him.”
the
police
officer
testified
that
he
was
not
scared
by
these
remarks
but
he
said
he
was
shook
up
because
he
said
we
had
presidential
assassinations
and
we've
attempted
assassinations
and
i
didn't
know
whether
he
was
mad
or
whether
he
was
serious.
all
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
the
defendant
appeared
serious
when
he
made
the
statements
he
made.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
think
that
would
be
an
inference
on
my
part
but
i
would
assume
he
meant
crazy.
of
course,
a
person
being
crazy
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
is
not
a
threat
to
the
lives
of
other
people.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
that
judgment
has
been
made
on
reflection
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
on
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
didn't
--
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
say
that
anybody
thought
it
was
not
a
real
threat.
that
--
that
matter
was
submitted
to
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
has
been
imprisoned
for
more
than
two
years.
he
served
his
sentence
under
the
original
judgment
of
the
conviction.
and
that
is
a
consideration
that
the
government
has
taken
into
account.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
he
is
on
--
the
sentence
to
included
a
five-year
condition
of
sentence
of
probation
which
included
as
a
condition
thereof
participation
in
the
alcoholics
anonymous
program.
so,
the
case
is
not
moot.
he
has
that
constraint.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
because
the
man
has
a
history
--
a
chronic
history
of
alcoholism.
the
question
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
there
is
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
yet
there
is
evidence
that
he
didn't
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
but
the
crime
we're
dealing
with
--
the
crime
that
presents
the
background
to
all
of
these
law
and
in
our
concern
is
the
crime
of
presidential
assassination
and
i
would
assume
we
would
all
agree
that
any
one
who
--
would
even
contemplate
such
a
crime
would
be
in
some
sense
unstable
and
then
some
sense
are
not.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
we
are
not
going
to
retry
him
because
of
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
there
are
circumstances,
mr.
justice,
which
i
haven't
get
to
mention
which
include
the
fact
that
there
is
a
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
jury
returned
an
unconditional
verdict.
thus,
we're
not
even
absolutely
sure
that
we
have
a
fact
finding
by
a
jury
that
these
were
serious
threats.
that
is
another
considerations
and
addition
to
the
ones
i've
already
mentioned.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
turn
to
those
particular
circumstances
because
they
color
the
question
that
the
court
is
asking
and
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
of
the
circumstances
which
lead
us
to
believe
that
the
conviction
in
this
case
may
in
fact
not
have
been
an
unqualified
conviction.
after
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury,
we
believe,
correctly
instructed
the
jury,
the
jury
deliberated
for
two
hours
and
then
sent
the
trial
judge
a
note.
the
note
asked
the
court
whether
the
court
would
accept
a
verdict
of
“guilty
as
charged
with
extreme
mercy
of
the
court.”
upon
receiving
that
note,
the
trial
court
without
consulting
counsel
instructed
the
marshal
that
the
court's
answer
was
in
the
affirmative.
this
note
in
the
court's
answer
appears
at
page
52
of
the
appendix.
five
minutes
after
receiving
the
court's
answer,
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty
in
the
form
i've
just
discussed,
guilty
as
charged
with
extreme
mercy
of
the
court.
ordinarily,
it
would
be
the
government's
view
that
a
recommendation
of
mercy
of
this
kind
is
mere
surplusage
could
be
discounted
and
would
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
verdict.
here
however,
we
have
in
addition
to
the
form
of
the
verdict
the
fact
that
it
was
arrived
at
by
a
unilateral
communication
from
the
district
court
to
the
jury.
in
our
view,
the
jury's
question
about
whether
the
court
would
accept
such
a
verdict
was
in
effect
a
request
for
further
instruction
and
we
think
that
the
proper
instructions
to
be
given
under
those
circumstances
would
have
been
that
the
jury
has
no
sentencing
function
that
it
must
reach
its
verdict
without
consideration
of
the
matter
of
sentence
and
that
any
recommendation
it
did
make
would
not
be
binding
upon
the
trial
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
moreover,
we
believe
that
before
any
response
is
made,
counsel
should
be
informed
and
counsel
should
be
heard
from.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
would
assume
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
if
the
jury
is
talking
about
mercy,
he
may
feel
that
they
are
taking
the
possibility
of
punishment
into
the
account
to
break
a
deadlock
or
to
resolve
a
question
in
favor
of
guilt.
and
that's
why
we
think
it's
important
that
counsel
should
be
heard
from
and
we
feel
as
a
textural
matter
that
a
response
without
informing
counsel
arguably
will
in
fact
does
deprive
the
defendant
of
the
right
to
be
present
at
every
stage
of
the
trial
as
is
guaranteed
by
rule
43
of
he
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
that
is
our
view,
mr.
justice,
and
for
the
reason
that
precisely
because
this
was
a
unilateral
communication
to
the
jury
which
counsel
was
not
informed
about,
they
were
not
in
the
position
to
object
to
it
and
not
knowing
about
it,
it
is
hard
for
us
to
say
that
they
knowingly
waived
any
objection
that
they
might
have
to
this
circumstance.
we
pointed
out
in
our
original
papers
on
the
petition
the
form
of
the
verdict
as
raising
a
question
all
by
itself
and
suggested
that
arguably
it
was
waived.
it
was
in
the
preparation
of
the
brief
on
the
merits
that
we
discovered
that
in
addition
to
the
form
of
the
verdict.
there
was
the
fact
that
it
have
been
arrived
at
by
a
unilateral
communication
from
the
judge
and
those
two
things
taken
together
raised
in
our
mind
a
substantial
question
is
to
whether
the
verdict
was
in
fact
unqualified.
and
we
offer
those
facts
for
the
court's
consideration.
i
am
prepared
if
the
court
desires
to
discuss
the
court's
trial
instructions.
the
elements
of
the
offense
as
we
believe
them
to
be,
because
we
believe
that
court
correctly
instructed
the
jury,
and
i
am
prepared
if
the
court
desires
to
discuss
the
first
amendment
implications
of
the
case.
i
would
ask
the
court
whether
it
has
any
questions
in
any
of
these
areas
or
desires
to
hear
from
the
government
further.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
very
well
mr.
justice,
i'm
prepared
to
proceed
with
that.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
don't
understand
your
question
mr.
justice,
excuse
me.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
mr.
justice,
i
apologize
if
my
suggestion
is
an
inappropriate
one
to
the
court.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
--
the
reason
why
i
made
the
suggestion
was
merely
because
we
thought
the
case
would
probably
be
disposed
of
on
the
ground
that
we
had
raised.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
was
not
and
therefore,
i
suggested
that
i
was
prepared
to
proceed
and
i
apologize
for
putting
it
in
the
form
of
a
question
rather
than
a
continuing
presentation.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
--
on
the
elements
of
offense
in
stating
to
the
court
inconsistent
with
the
--
stating
to
the
jury
consistent
with
the
watts
decision
that
only
a
true
threat
would
be
a
threat
within
the
contemplation
of
the
statute
and
that
a
political
argument
or
idle
talk
or
a
jest
would
not
violate
the
statute.
on
the
question
of
intent
which
is
the
central
question
in
the
case,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
a
threat
is
a
willful
if
the
maker
voluntarily
and
intentionally
other's
words
is
a
declaration
of
an
apparent
intention
to
carry
out
the
threat.
the
court
also
used
the
words
and
i'm
leaving
out
a
few
words
here
that
the
defendant
intentionally
made
the
threat
that
a
reasonable
person
would
foresee
would
be
interpreted
as
a
serious
expression
of
intent.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
actual
intent
to
harm
was
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
in
our
view,
these
are
correct
instructions.
as
we
have
seen
the
issue
in
this
case,
the
issue
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
verbal
conflict
amongst
the
circuits
given
circulation
by
the
patillo
decision.
the
issue
was
whether
the
statute
requires
a
subjective
intent
to
harm
the
president
or
whether
the
statute
prescribes
words
which
objectively
considered
would
appear
to
be
serious.
petitioner's
reply
brief,
however,
does
not
urge
this
distinction
and
does
not
urge
that
actual
harm
to
the
president
ought
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense.
rather,
they
urged
that
the
specific
intent
required
has
specific
intent
that
the
threat
be
communicated
to
the
president.
we
don't
think
that
either
of
these
elements
are
in
the
statute
either
by
congressional
intention
ought
to
construed
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
limitation.
we
begin
with
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
words
“punishes
a
person
who
knowingly
and
willfully
makes
a
threat
to
take
a
life
favor
and
flick
bodily
harm
upon
the
president
of
the
united
states”.
the
words
“knowingly
and
willfully”
these
adverbs
modify
and
refer
to
the
act
of
making
the
threat
and
textually
in
any
event
do
not
require
that
the
maker
have
an
inward
desire
either
to
harm
the
president
or
to
have
the
threat
communicated.
we
believe
that
the
harm
caused
by
a
threat
is
caused
by
the
mere
utterance
of
the
threat
in
circumstances
where
it
would
generally
be
considered
serious.
if
two
persons
are
similarly
situated
then
utter
the
same
words
which
are
apparently
serious
threats,
the
effect
of
these
words
are
the
same
even
if
one
of
them
harbors
an
inward
desire
to
harm
the
president
and
the
other
does
not.
where
a
threat
is
objectively
serious
it
can't
be
ignore
and
requires
a
responds
from
those
charges
with
the
protection
of
the
president.
in
fact,
it
could
endanger
the
president
by
diverting
those
resources.
if
we
--
we
don't
think
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
prevent
harm
to
the
president
by
convicting
people
who
threaten
to
kill
the
president
with
an
intention
to
carry
it
out.
the
house
report
on
a
1916
bill
which
became
the
law
states
the
purpose
of
the
president
--
states
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
protecting
the
president
from
threats
or
violence
which
would
restrain
or
coerce
him
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
that
restraint
or
coercion
to
the
extent
that
it
occurs,
occurs
whenever
the
words
are
objectively
serious
and
that
restraint
and
coercion
is
neither
augmented
nor
diminished
by
the
subjective
intent
of
the
speaker.
where
the
threat
is
apparently
serious,
the
secret
service
has
to
investigate
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
sidetracked
by
a
bluff
is
diverted
from
the
supremely
serious
business
of
defending
and
protecting
the
life
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
our
view
that
the
term
“willful”
refers
to
the
intent
to
make
the
threat
rather
than
an
intent
to
harm
the
president
is
we
believe
supported
by
the
legislative
debate
on
the
bill
which
became
the
law
which
is
the
predecessor
to
871.
among
the
things
you
will
find
in
that
legislative
debate
is
a
discussion
of
an
example
of
an
individual
who
finds
a
document
containing
a
threat
and
mails
it
to
someone
as
a
matter
of
news.
congressman
volstead
urged
that
the
word
“willful”
be
retained
in
the
statute
in
order
to
assure
that
such
a
person
sending
--
knowingly
sending
such
words
but
not
intending
a
threat
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
the
statute.
in
our
view,
therefore,
congress'
intent
was
to
punish
one
who
knowingly
and
intentionally
makes
a
threat
under
circumstances
which
objectively
viewed
would
be
considered
serious
and
sincere.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
as
a
matter
of
news,
i
think
that
would
fall
precisely
within
that
discussion
and
that
shows
the
point
of
having
the
word
“knowingly
and
willfully”
in
the
statute
in
our
construction
of
the
statute.
of
course,
the
statute
does
punish
the
utterance
of
mere
words
and
therefore
has
to
be
waived
against
the
first
amendment's
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
would
have
to
--
before
i
could
answer
that
question,
know
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
made.
if
the
statement
was,
“as
soon
as
i
get
out
of
here,
i'm
going
straight
to
washington.”
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i'm
going
to
washington.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
if
he
repeated
them
as
a
matter
of
saying,
“i
was
convicted
for
the
following
words"
or
in
circumstances
which
led
--
which
the
fact
finder
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
would
think
that
those
would
probably
be
words
of
repetition
of
explanation
of
what
he
had
said
before
and
would
not
constitute
a
true
threat.
but
i
do
believe
that
a
person
who
was
in
custody
and
under
restraint
could
in
fact
make
a
true
threat.
in
the
hypothetical
you
put,
my
judgment
would
be
that
that
would
probably
not
being
a
threat.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that's
correct.
the
example
i
gave
--
you
gave
i
suggest
that
it
was
probably
not
a
true
threat
under
the
circumstances
that
you
have
hypothesized.
returning
for
the
brief
for
moment
to
the
first
amendment
issue
in
the
case
which
we
do
not
consider
a
serious
one.
it
has
long
been
clear
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
confer
absolute
protection
for
all
utterances
in
all
circumstances
and
at
all
times.
some
words
by
their
very
utterance
create
an
evil
against
which
the
legislature
can
act.
a
classic
example
and
one
that
shows
that
the
subjective
intent
of
the
maker
is
not
always
relevant
to
the
consequences
of
speech
is
justice
holmes's
example
of
a
man
who
falsely
shots
fire
in
the
theater
and
causes
a
panic.
this
court
said
the
chaplinsky
case,
there
are
certain
well
defined
and
narrowly
limited
classes
of
speech
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
which
have
never
been
thought
to
raise
serious
constitutional
problems.
in
our
view,
if
there
is
any
such
class
of
speech,
it
includes
true
threats
to
kill
the
president
of
the
united
states.
a
true
threat
is
not
advocacy,
it's
no
part
of
the
exposition
of
ideas,
it
doesn't
seek
to
persuade
and
is
not
neutralized
by
a
verbal
response.
it
thus
does
not
implicate
the
central
policy
of
the
first
amendment
which
is
that
speech
can
rebut
speech
and
propaganda
answer
propaganda.
a
true
threat
is
punishable
because
it
creates
an
evil
which
congress
can
prevent.
as
i've
indicated,
a
threat
demands
a
response
from
those
charge
with
the
president's
protection.
it
diverts
the
resources
of
that
agency
and
the
process
tends
to
limit
the
president's
activities
or
in
the
words
of
the
house
report
“restrain
or
coerce
him
in
the
exercise
of
his
constitutional
duties.”
there
is
a
perhaps
another
consideration.
the
federal
laws
concerning
threats
are
not
limited
to
threats
against
the
president
of
the
united
states.
18
u.s.c.
section
875
and
876
for
instance
forbids
the
interstate
communication
in
mailing
of
threats
to
do
bodily
injury.
threats
of
this
kind
and
i
would
submit
a
fortiori
threats
to
do
bodily
harm
to
or
kill
the
president
of
the
united
states
are
punishable
because
of
the
anxiety,
the
fear,
the
turmoil
and
the
potential
for
violence
that
they
create
whether
or
not
they
are
heard
by
the
intended
victim.
advocacy
is
wholly
different
in
our
view.
advocacy
is
protected
by
the
constitution
even
when
it
creates
anger
or
resentment
or
uncertainty
or
unrest.
but
threats
are
different
in
their
consequences.
threats
are
different
in
the
emotions
they
evoke
and
in
the
anxiety
that
they
create.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
believe
it
is.
in
fact,
we
cite
in
our
brief
some
cases
which
have
been
decided
under
the
statutes
i've
just
mentioned
where
the
threats
have
been
communicated
to
third
parties.
one
in
the
case
of
threat
to
a
mother
to
harm
her
son
and
another
case
they
call
to
the
fbi
with
a
threat
to
kill
some
third
party.
i
think
that
these
threats
do
create
a
climate
of
anxiety
particularly
a
threat
to
kill
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
mind
just
speaking
of
a
true
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
warren
commission
report
does
indicate
that
threats
to
the
president
constitute
a
serious
drain
on
the
resources
of
the
commission.
and
we
feel
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
simply
misspoke.
a
serious
drain
on
the
resources
of
the
secret
service
in
responding
to
these
threats
and
investigating
them
and
trying
to
determine
whether
they're
serious
and
of
course
in
most
instances
the
answer
is
you
cannot
tell
whether
they're
serious
or
not.
in
our
view,
threats
are
simply
not
part
of
the
area
of
protected
speech.
the
constitution
requires
that
the
public
debate
be
robust
and
uninhibited
and
wide
open
as
this
court
said
in
the
new
york
times
case.
but
there
is
no
place
in
the
public
debate
for
true
threats
to
commit
murder.
the
evil
against
which
the
statute
is
aimed
is
truly
a
grave
one
and
the
restrictions
which
the
statute
imposes
on
speech
are
quite
minor
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
causes
people
to
avoid
language
which
might
be
objectively
considered
a
threat.
we
submit
that
the
incursion
on
protected
speech
is
minor
and
permissible.
i've
already
indicate
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no,
very
early
on
in
the
very
earliest
cases
on
rulings
on
demurs
to
the
indictment.
it
was
established
that
there
was
no
requirement
of
communication
to
the
president
and
no
court
has
so
required
to
the
extent
that
my
research
has
developed.
i
thank
the
court.
