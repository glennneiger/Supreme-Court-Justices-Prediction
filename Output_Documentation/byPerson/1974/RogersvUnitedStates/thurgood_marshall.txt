justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
those
threats
made
to
any
private
individual
or
were
they're
made
to
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
that
i've
interrupted
you.
you
interpreted,
when
is
he
going
to
kill
the
president?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
was
in
shreveport
which
is
a
little
ways
away?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
a
little
ways
from
washington.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
also
true
that
when
he
goes
in
those
direction
they
lockup
and
that's
like
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
agreed
that
he
hadn't
violated
any
louisiana
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
would
a
man
who
was
not
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
wasn't
drunkard,
why
was
his
probation
put
on
alcoholics
anonymous?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean
he
is
a
chronic
alcoholic.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
anybody
to
goes
into
it
jail
--
i
mean,
a
precinct,
the
station
of
police
and
confesses
to
a
crime
that
the
only
way
he
could
commit
it
was
by
confessing
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
doesn't
been
offered
not
to
go
in
and
then
confess,
wouldn't
he?
would
he
be
a
great
aim
that
to
just
go
in
and
say,
“i
insist”
and
you
emphasize
the
factors
that
overrule
here,
i'm
going
to
kill
him,
i
going
to
kill
him,
i
going
to
kill
him.
he
say,
“please
lock
me
up
and
put
me
some
place”
isn't
it?
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
do
that
and
come
here
to
say
you're
not
going
to
retry
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
before
you
get
there
mr.
tuttle,
during
the
two
years
he
was
in
jail,
suppose
he
made
the
same
threat,
will
he
violate
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
exact
same
statements
you
made
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
the
exact
same
statements
he's
charged
with
making.
he
repeated
that
in
the
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
tuttle,
i
said
he
says
the
exact
same
words
and
nothing
else.
now,
can
i
get
an
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
now
where
he
is
now
in
a
place
as
nicely
called
an
alcoholic
place,
suppose
he
repeats
in
there
and
when
you
leave
there
i'm
going
to
take
you
to
the
cell
and
so.
some
place
i
think
he
can
say
it's
not
a
threat,
am
i
right?
