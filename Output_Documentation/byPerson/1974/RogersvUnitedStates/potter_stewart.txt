justice
potter
stewart
in
five
occasions,
three
of
them
on
that
morning
in
the
holiday
inn
resident
dining
room
and
that
two
were
later
to
the
police
officers,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
substantially
the
same
statement
each
time?
justice
potter
stewart
by
mad,
do
you
think
he
meant
angry
or
crazy?
justice
potter
stewart
as
that
well
that
would
be
true
about
threat
they
communicated
to
the
target
of
the
threat
but
is
it
going
to
be
true
of
a
threat
against
acts
when
made
to
a,
b
and
c?
justice
potter
stewart
has
any
court
ever
taken
the
view
in
construing
this
statute
that
it
applies
only
to
communications
directed
to
the
president
or
the
other
--
