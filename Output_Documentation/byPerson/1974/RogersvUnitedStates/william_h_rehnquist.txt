justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
ever
raise
that
question
yourself
did
you
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
feel
it
was
sufficient
to
call
either
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
would
support
it
and
thought
it
was
of
any
importance
at
all?
why
didn't
you
raise
it
either
to
the
district
court
when
you
found
out
about
it
or
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
find
out
about
when
you
got
the
court
of
appeals,
why
didn't
you
press
that
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
but
on
the
court
--
when
the
court
pulled
the
jury
you
had
some
implication
of
it,
didn't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
still
did
nothing
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
he
still
being
confined
other
than
separately
for
some
alcoholic
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
have
a
good
deal
of
question
mr.
chief
justice.
i
take
it
that
you're
here
arguing
in
support
of
affirmance
and
that
there
have
been
first
amendment
questions
raised
i
would
like
to
hear
your
presentation
of
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
parnell,
would
you
turn
to
page
52
of
the
brown
appendix
if
you
have
that
in
front
of
you
that
has
that
entry
entitled
handwritten
note
then
apparently
the
foreman's
signature
and
then
below
that
what
appears
to
be
judge
dawkins
response
to
it.
now,
i
take
it
as
the
appellant
from
the
district
court's
judgment
of
conviction
you
were
responsible
for
preparing
the
record
in
the
fifth
circuit,
were
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
presume
this
was
a
part
of
the
record
that
you've
prepared
for
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
did
it
get
into
the
record
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
are
records
prepared
on
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
couldn't
find
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
you
know,
you
did
not
designate
this
is
a
part
of
the
record.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
have
no
idea
how
it
got
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
have
no
idea
how
it
got
to
be
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
for
that
matter,
you're
not
sure
that
really
is
genuine,
i
suppose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not
if
you
never
seen
it
before?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
exhibits
introduced
where?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
would
thought
this
would've
occurred
after
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
offered
to
the
judge
and
goes
to
the
jury
and
submit
them.
