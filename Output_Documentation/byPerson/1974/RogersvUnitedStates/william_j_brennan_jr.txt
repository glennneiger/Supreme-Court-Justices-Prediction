justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
parnell,
are
you
going
to
deal
with
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general
we
ought
not
reach
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
your
reaction
to
it?
apparently,
the
government
is
saying,
they
don't
want
to
retry
this
man
and
that
this
conviction
ought
to
be
set
aside.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
support
--
suppose
you
would
support.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
tuttle,
your
suggestion
that
this
conviction
we
set
aside
be
accompanied
where
the
statement
that
if
it
is
set
aside,
the
government
will
not
retry
him
some
of
the
things
you
were
saying
seem
however
inconsistent
with
that
determination.
why
is
it
you
would
retry
him
if
you
set
aside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
what
the
government
also
thinks,
did
it
not?
not
a
real
threat.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
didn't.
i'm
suggesting
that
--
is
that
--
if
you're
not
going
to
retry
him
there
must
be
some
element
of
a
judgment
that
it
is
in
fact
and
not
--
not
a
real
threat.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
gather
mr.
tuttle
your
view
is
that
this
falls
within
the
category
of
plain
error
which
maybe
addressed
even
though
objection
was
not
made.
