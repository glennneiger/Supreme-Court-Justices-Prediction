mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
cause
which
arose
in
the
district
court
in
louisiana
as
result
of
a
statement
that
was
made
by
one
george
herman
rogers
on
march
23,
1972.
at
the
time
the
statement
was
made,
mr.
rogers
was
in
a
holiday
inn
in
shreveport,
louisiana
at
approximately
six
o'clock
in
the
morning.
as
result
of
the
statement,
mr.
rogers
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
(a)
871
(a)
which
reads
as
follows:
“whoever
knowingly
and
willfully
deposits
for
conveyance
in
the
mail
or
for
delivery
from
any
post
office
or
by
any
letter
carrier
of
any
letter,
paper,
writing,
print,
missive,
or
document
containing
any
threat
to
take
the
life
of
or
to
inflict
bodily
harm
upon
the
president
of
the
united
states,
the
president
elect,
the
vice
president
or
other
officer
next
in
order
of
succession
to
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
or
the
vice
president
elect
or
knowingly
and
willfully
otherwise
makes
any
such
threat
against
the
president,
president
elect,
vice
president
or
other
next
officer
in
succession
to
the
office
of
president
or
vice
president
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$1,000.00
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
five
years
above.”
the
statement
or
statements
that
mr.
rogers
has
been
charged
to
have
made
as
i
said
were
made
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning,
initially
made
in
the
presence
of
three
waitresses
at
this
particular
holiday
inn.
the
reaction
of
the
three
ladies
that
heard
the
statement,
they're
all
describing
as
being
odd,
irrational,
something
wrong
within.
the
statements
that
were
charged
in
the
indictment
were
taken
out
of
context,
they
were
taken
out
of
a
discussion
that
mr.
rogers
was
trying
to
have
with
the
three
waitresses.
mr.
rogers
had
expressed
to
all
three
that
he
was
very
much
upset
about
at
the
time
president
nixon's
trip
to
china.
this
event
took
place
immediately
after
president
nixon's
trip
to
china.
mr.
rogers
in
his
comments
said
that
he
disagreed
with
president
nixon
being
in
china,
that
the
president
was
consorting
with
our
enemy.
he
did
not
like
the
communist,
he
did
not
like
the
red
chinese,
he
was
very
upset
with
our
president
selling
us
out
and
for
that
he
was
going
to
washington
to
beat
his
ass.
this
in
essence
is
what
mr.
rogers
is
charged
with.
he
said
these
allegedly
on
five
occasions,
the
words
being
the
same.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
substantially,
the
same
statement,
also
substantially
the
same
conversation
each
time.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
this
was
said
i
believe,
your
honor,
to
the
police
officers.
that
is
correct.
each
time
that
mr.
rogers
tried
to
engage
in
a
conversation
or
discussion
of
the
political
topic
of
the
day
which
was
president
nixon's
trip
to
china.
he
was
rebuffed.
nobody
was
really
looking
and
listening
to
him.
one
of
the
witnesses
--
one
of
the
gentlemen
that
heard
the
statement
said
that
he
was
somewhat
irritated
by
mr.
rogers'
disturbance.
he
was
disturbing,
this
man
was
a
businessman.
he
was
trying
to
get
ready
for
his
day's
work
and
mr.
rogers
was
disturbing
him
from
thinking
about
his
business
of
the
day.
all
witnesses
said
that
they
initially
thought
that
mr.
rogers
was
intoxicated.
one
witness,
one
of
the
waitresses
said
that
she
smell
the
faint
odor
of
alcohol
on
mr.
rogers'
breath.
she
also
said
that
in
her
conversation
with
mr.
rogers,
that
it
was
raining
and
that
she
said
that
she
wished
that
it
would
stop
raining.
and
at
this
point,
mr.
rogers
informed
her
that
he
could
make
it
stop
raining.
and
she
said
that
she
laughed
at
this
and
thought
that
maybe
we
have
to
leave
that
to
higher
power,
and
mr.
rogers
informed
her
that
he
was
that
higher
power
that
he
was
jesus
christ.
these
statements
taken
in
this
context
we
feel
like
are
not
and
cannot
be
prosecuted
under
the
statute
that
i
read
under
18
u.s.c.
(a)
871
(a).
this
statute
is
a
good
statute.
certainly,
the
united
states
has
a
paramount
right
and
duty
to
protect
its
highest
officer,
the
president
of
the
united
states.
it
would
not
--
if
we
do
not
protect
our
highest
officer
from
a
serious
or
true
threat
and
we
would
certainly
be
jeopardizing
not
only
his
life
but
his
enforcement
or
his
duties
or
keying
out
his
duties.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
or
at
least
the
history
of
it
--
the
legislative
history
of
it
indicates
that
in
1916,
at
the
time
the
statute,
was
passed
that
the
president
was
having
some
difficulty
with
written
threats.
mr.
webb
in
arguing
for
passage
of
the
legislation
stated
that
the
written
documents
that
the
president
was
receiving
was
annoying
to
him,
was
irritating
to
him,
was
causing
the
president
to
trouble.
so,
they
--
he
said,
“we
need
to
enact
this
law
to
prevent
people
from
writing
to
the
president
and
threatening
him.”
i
do
not
believe
that
at
the
time
this
law
was
passed
that
the
legislators
intended
for
it
to
be
carried
as
far
as
it's
being
carried
today
particularly
to
mr.
george
herman
rogers.
the
law
was
passed
in
a
tranquil
period
of
time.
it
was
first
interpreted
during
world
war
i
when
the
atmosphere
of
the
country
was
somewhat
storming.
the
early
cases
are
all
very
similar
in
the
utterances
which
were
prosecuted
to
the
ones
that
mr.
george
herman
rogers
made.
i
truly
believe
that
had
those
three
men
--
or
had
the
people
or
the
men
in
the
early
cases
have
they've
been
tried
today
that
they
certainly
would
not
be
convicted
under
the
statute
for
the
statements
they
made.
i
think
this
--
their
utterances
towards
president
at
the
time
wilson
in
no
way
under
today's
interpretations
of
the
law
would
be
considered
a
true
threat
against
the
president
of
the
united
states.
this
court
has
expressed
its
views
on
threats
or
statements
or
utterances
against
the
president
of
united
states
in
only
one
occasion
and
that
was
in
the
case
of
watts
versus
united
states.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that,
first
of
all,
there
must
be
a
true
threat
made
before
it
can
be
threat
against
the
president
of
united
states.
i
believe
that
we
we're
here
this
morning
to
try
to
define
what
a
true
threat
is.
i
think
that
this
court
must
lay
down
now
guidelines
for
the
fact
finders
to
determine
what
a
true
threat
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
statute
was
passed
to
at
that
time
what
was
i
suppose
a
true
threat
against
the
country
and
that
was
that
anybody
the
theory
was
that
anybody
that
spoke
out
against
the
president
or
against
the
man
in
authority
was
in
someway
being
disloyal
to
the
united
states,
was
trying
to
incite
others
to
maybe
carry
out
the
act.
and
we
don't
believe
that
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
that
this
law
can
be
applied
to
the
facts
before
the
court.
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i'm
not.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor
as
defense
counsel
i
would
adopt
any
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
may
have
towards
releasing
my
client
or
acquitting
him
on
any
basis,
i
certainly
would.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
no,
we
did
not
raise
that
issue.
it's
before
--
it
has
been
raised
for
the
first
time
before
this
court.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
your
honor
he
was
sentenced
to
five
years,
he
--
the
fifth
circuit
expressed
some
concern
about
the
sentence.
the
district
court
then
cuts
the
sentence
back
to
three
years,
he
has
served
some
two
years
of
that
sentence.
presently,
mr.
rogers
is
in
the
hospital
being
treated
for
alcoholism.
as
the
brief
states,
mr.
rogers
has
a
serious
history
of
chronic
alcoholism.
he
has
over
100
arrests
in
the
past
10
years
for
being
simply
drunk.
your
honor,
as
far
as
your
inquiry
as
to
our
position
on
releasing
mr.
rogers
due
to
the
communication
that
was
directed
from
the
jury
to
the
court
and
back
to
the
jury.
again,
i
would
say
that
of
course
we
would
have
no
objection
whatsoever
this
case
turned
on
that.
however,
we
feel
like
--i
would
suppose
you
support
it.sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
yes
very
definitely,
we
would
support
it
anyway.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
because
we
did
not
find
that
about
it
until
--
i
would
assume
until
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
even
after
that.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
to
be
honest
with
you,
we
felt
like
that
the
issues
involved
as
far
as
mr.
rogers
was
concerned
we
thought
that
we
had
a
better
argument
on
the
law
than
with
this
technical
violation
of
the
other
law.
we
didn't
know
about
it
to
be
honest
with
you.
we
did
not
know
that
the
court
had
talked
to
the
jury.
we
didn't
know
it.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
we
had
some
indication
in,
yes
we
did.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
no.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
very
brief
in
reply
to
counsel
as
to
he
inferred
that
the
facts
are
going
to
speak
for
themselves
the
record
will
speak
for
themselves.
he
inferred
that
mr.
rogers
was
hitchhiking
to
washington
when
in
fact
he
was
trying
to
hitchhike
to
texarkana
which
is
where
the
man
resided
at
the
time.
he
was
not
arrested
by
the
local
police
department
in
shreveport.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
disturbing
the
peace
is
as
close
as
we
could
pen
it
down.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
until
--
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
to
actually
kill
a
president?
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
further,
counsel
would
have
this
class
of
speech
in
its
purest
form,
the
words
“i
will
kill
the
president”
thrown
out
from
under
the
umbrella
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
wherein
his
brief
on
page
19.
he
says
that
a
declaration
or
announcement
for
example
that
“the
president
must
be
killed
and
i
will
do
it”
may
take
on
a
different
character
when
made
during
the
political
speech.
it
is
to
be
sure
accrued
offensive
way
for
the
speaker
to
make
his
point
of
political
opposition.
we
feel
like
that
mr.
rogers
own
this
particular
raining
morning
in
march
three
years
ago
was
doing
no
more
than
very
crudely
chastising
president
nixon
for
his
trip
to
red
china
and
that
under
the
situation
--
under
the
circumstances
that
he
was
not
a
true
threat
to
the
president
of
united
states.
he
did
not
utter
a
true
threat
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
certainly
should
not
be
convicted
under
the
statute.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
was
in
the
record
at
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
i
never
knew
that
this
note
existed.
in
fact,
i
only
saw
this
note
for
the
first
time
when
we
were
preparing
this
brief
here.
it's
the
first
time
i
saw
it.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
your
honor,
we
had
a
problem
with
that
--
with
what
you're
brining
up
right
now.
the
procedure
was
somewhat
confused.
in
fact,
at
one
point
we
had
a
problem
in
locating
part
of
the
record.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
couldn't
find
it.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
no.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
no.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
i
would
not
doubt
the
genuineness
of
it,
no.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
i
have
seen
it.
the
first
time
i
saw
it
was
when
we
begin
preparation
of
our
brief
to
the
united
states
supreme
court.
and
it
was
at
that
time
a
part
of
the
exhibits
that
were
introduced,
and
that's
where
i
found
it.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
at
trial.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
had
two
separate
if
i
may
--
we
had
two
separate
files.
we
had
the
actual
record
which
was
the
printed
word
or
the
transcript
of
what
transpired.
and
then
we
had
another
file
that
had
exhibits
in
it
that
were
introduced
in
the
file
such
as
i
believe
we
introduced
the
psychiatrist
report.
we
introduced
the
--
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
right,
evidence.
that's
correct.
and
it
was
in
this
file
that
i
found
the
note
for
the
first
time.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
ralph
w.
parnell,
jr.
yes,
i
did.
