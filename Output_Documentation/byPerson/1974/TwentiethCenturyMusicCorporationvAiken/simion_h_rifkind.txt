mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
of
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
petitioners
have
brought
this
suit
to
enforce
their
copyright
claims
against
the
respondent
aiken,
who
they
alleged
had
infringed
their
rights
by
a
public
performance
for
profit
of
two
songs,
one
the
copyrighter
which
belonged
to
each
of
the
petitioners
respectively.
the
district
judge
granted
the
statutory
damages
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
below
of
$250.00
for
each
infringement,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
its
asserted
ground
for
reversal
was
that
aiken's
conduct
did
not
amount
to
a
performance
though
it
was
public
and
it
was
for
profit.
the
facts
are
simple.
respondent
aiken
owns
and
operates
a
chain
of
fast
food
restaurants
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
he
decided
to
entertain
his
costumers
and
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
his
employees
by
furnishing
them
with
popular
musical
performances
throughout
the
business
day.
there
were,
as
i
believe
we
can
take
judicial
notice,
available
to
him
several
methods
by
which
his
purposes
could
be
accomplished.
one,
he
could
hire
one
or
more
musicians
to
play
such
compositions
as
he
or
his
agent
selected
from
the
cheap
music
generally
available
to
the
public.
secondly,
he
could
if
he
chose
equipt
the
premises
with
one
or
more
machines
that
reproduce
music
mechanically
when
supplied
with
either
records
or
tapes
or
piano
roles,
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
particular
machine
that
he
decided
to
use,
and
these
too
are
generally
available
for
purchase
by
members
of
the
public.
or
he
could
subscribe
to
a
service
like
muzak
which
provides
musical
compositions
for
use
in
premises
by
machinery
equipped
for
that
purpose.
and
finally,
he
could
if
he
wished,
equipt
his
premises
with
a
radio
receiving
set
connected
to
an
electric
source
of
energy,
install
a
sufficient
number
of
loudspeakers
so
as
to
disseminate
the
sound
agreeably
throughout
the
premises
that
he
wished
to
serve,
and
cause
the
radio
receiving
set
to
be
oriented
by
his
selection
to
any
kind
of
music
that
he
preferred
from
among
the
many
that
were
being
broadcast
within
the
pittsburgh
area
by
the
several
stations
doing
business
there.
aiken
in
fact
chose
the
last
mentioned
method.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
argue
the
point
that
it
was
the
least
costly
method.
the
district
judge
after
trial
found
that
on
the
11th
of
march
1972,
aiken
had
caused
the
costumers
and
employees
in
one
of
his
restaurants
to
be
entertained
by
two
compositions
of
which
the
petitioners
were
respectively
the
copyright
owners
these
compositions
were
received
over
aiken's
radio
and
were
distributed
through
his
restaurant
and
employment
spaces
through
five
loudspeakers
which
he
had
installed
in
the
premises.
these
two
compositions
which
he
so
played
were
broadcast
that
day
by
a
fm
station
located
in
pittsburgh
and
licensed
to
broadcast
those
compositions.
aiken
however
had
no
license
for
the
public
performance
for
profit
of
these
compositions
and
the
radio
station
had
no
authority
to
confer
such
permission
upon
aiken.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
that
is
precisely,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
possibility
of
an
applied
license
had
been
expressly
and
explicitly
withdrawn
in
the
license
issued
by
the
copyright
owners
to
this
particular
station
as
to
all
stations,
and
that
had
been
true
since
1932.
so
this
--
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
there
were
five.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
some
in
the
public
spaces
where
costumers
were
entertained
and
some
in
the
workspaces
where
the
employees
were
--
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
it's
all
in
one
restaurant.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
oh
no,
he
has
other
restaurants,
but
this
particular
infringement
was
of
course
brought
as
a
test
situation
for
the
particular
two
songs
that
we
are
talking
about.
the
district
court
granted
the
plaintiff
below
the
monetary
damages
requested
which
was
$250.00
for
each
composition
at
the
statutory
rate.
as
i've
already
stated,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
and
i
submit
that
i
can
state
with
confidence
that
the
business
purpose
behind
the
selection
of
any
one
of
the
methods
by
which
aiken
could
have
supplied
musical
entertainment
to
his
guests
and
employees
was
identical.
it
was
to
entertain
guests
and
it
was
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
his
employees.
this
much
i
believe
is
clear
on
the
record,
and
all
of
these
methods
which
ever
one
he
selected
would
have
to
have
recourse
to
music
created
by
composers
and
made
available
to
the
public
by
means
of
either
cheap
music,
records,
tapes,piano
roles
or
broadcast
of
electrical
impulses.
and
i
suggest
that
until
the
third
circuit
had
spoken,
it
was
firmly
established
that
no
matter
by
which
method
aiken
entertained
his
guests
and
employees,
he
was
bound
to
abstain
unless
he
had
a
license
from
the
copyright
owner,
such
as
ascap
of
course.
and
of
course
such
licenses
were
universally
available
under
the
compulsion
of
a
decree
which
is
enforced
with
respect
to
ascap.
i
believe
that
it
is
still
unquestioned
that
live
performances
in
the
restaurant
by
live
musicians
would
be
subject
to
the
copyright
laws
and
subject
to
section
1
thereof,
and
that
has
been
true
certainly
since
mr.
justice
holmes
wrote
herbert
against
shanley
way
back
in
1917.
i
believe
it
is
still
unquestioned
that
the
record,
tape,
piano
role
method
or
electronic
method
of
music
is
a
public
performance
for
profit,
and
indeed
so
the
third
circuit
itself
had
held
on
a
number
of
times.
and
now
the
third
circuit
has
decided
that
the
last
method,
namely
the
radio
plus
loudspeaker
method,
although
realistically
and
functionally
indistinguishable
from
any
of
the
other
methods
of
furnishing
the
music,
is
for
some
reason
beyond
the
reach
of
section
1
of
the
copyright
act
although
it
is
public,
although
it
is
for
profit,
but
the
circuit
court
said
it
is
not
a
performance,
and
at
arriving
at
that
conclusion
that
it
was
not
a
performance,
it
said
that
it
acted
under
the
composure
of
this
court's
mandate
as
expressed
in
the
two
catv
cases,
the
fortnightly
case
and
the
teleprompter
case
and
it
is
that
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
i
most
distinctly
want
to
challenge.
we
challenge
it
and
we
challenge
that
decision
on
several
grounds.
we
assert
first
that
the
old
landmark
decision
rendered
in
1931
entitled
buck
against
jewell-lasalle
and
reported
in
283
u.s.
by
a
majority
court
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
brandeis,
controls
this
case
and
that
the
judgment
therefore
should
have
gone
for
the
petitioner.
we
also
assert
that
buck
against
jewell-lasalle
can
coexist
in
the
same
legal
universe
as
fortnightly
and
teleprompter
and
that
there
is
no
incompatibility
between
them
because
fortnightly
and
teleprompter
unlike
this
case,
were
concerned
with
a
new
technological
development,
never
prior
thereto
with
--
brought
within
the
copyright
system
and
never
subjected
to
copyright
royalty
burdens
and
respect
of
which
congress
had
been
quite
silent.
and
thirdly,
that
in
any
event,
private
arrangements
have
for
over
40
years
been
made
between
the
creators
and
consumers
of
mucic
in
reliance
on
jewell-lasalle
and
that
jewell-lasalle
therefore
ought
to
be
allowed
to
survive
until
congress
directs
otherwise.
as
far
as
the
congressional
voice
is
concerned,
if
i
can
read
the
incomplete
compositions
of
that
--
of
those
body,
i
can
say
that
it
seems
to
be
targeted
towards
the
continued
viability
of
the
doctrines
of
jewell-lasalle.
now,
to
develop
some
of
those
points
a
little
more
explicitly,
in
a
sense,
this
case
is
of
course
concerned
with
the
construction
of
a
section
of
the
copyright
law,
section
1
thereof.
and
that
is
of
primary
interest
to
the
authors,
composers
and
publishers
of
music
whom
the
founding
fathers
expressed
the
desire
to
encourage
in
the
copyright
and
patent
clause
of
the
constitution.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
development
of
our
jurisprudence,
i
believe
that
more
is
involved
than
whether
respondent
aiken
has
to
pay
$5.00
a
month
for
the
privilege
of
entertaining
his
business
guests
and
improving
the
morale
of
his
employees
with
music
created
by
the
copyright
owners.
i
suppose
that
the
statute
means
exactly
what
this
course
declares
it
means.
and
as
i've
stated
a
little
while
ago,
ever
since
1931,
which
is
44
years
ago,
the
meaning
of
that
statute
was
made
plain
in
the
case
that
i
have
cited
buck
against
jewell-lasalle.
it
declared
that
section
1
meant
that
one
situated
exactly
like
aiken
in
this
case
and
who
did
exactly
what
aiken
did
in
this
case
subjected
himself
to
liability
as
an
infringer
of
copyright,
unless
he
was
licensed
to
do
what
he
did.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
analysis
acknowledged
that
the
case
here
under
review
is
an
all
force
with
the
facts
of
the
case
in
jewell-lasalle.
over
5000
contracts
are
now
extent
that
we
know
of
which
have
been
entered
into
in
reliance
and
in
observance
of
jewell-lasalle,
and
in
that
case
mr.
justice
brandeis
for
a
unanimous
court
said
“there
is
no
difference”
--
we
give
you
the
exact
language
if
i
may.
“there
is
no
difference
in
substance
between
the
case
where
a
hotel
engages
an
orchestra
to
furnish
the
music,
and
that
where
by
means
of
the
radio
set
and
loudspeakers
here
employed,
it
furnishes
the
same
music
for
the
same
purpose.”
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
let
me
explain
that
most
explicitly.
the
rates
established
between
the
licensing
organization,
in
this
case
ascap,
which
speaks
for
the
owners
of
these
compositions
and
the
radio
industry
is
determined
under
a
system
which
is
subject
to
judicial
surveillance
under
the
decree
in
united
states
against
ascap,
which
has
been
administered
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
since
1940
and
amended
in
1950.
if
my
history,
if
my
recollection
of
the
dates
is
correct
and
i
believe
it
is.
those
terms
are
negotiated
in
terms
of
what
rights
are
conferred
upon
the
broadcaster.
in
this
particular
situation,
broadcasters
are
expressly
excluded
from
the
right
of
conferring
any
authority
upon
people
in
aiken's
position,
and
consequently
the
rate
that
they
pay
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
ascap
will
collect
another
fee
from
the
aikens
of
this
country,
and
therefore
the
fee
paid
by
the
broadcasters
does
not
overlap
the
fee
paid
by
the
aikens.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
agreed
that
the
circumstance
that
the
radio
station
in
jewell-lasalle
was
unlicensed
and
that
here
it
was
licensed
was
a
difference
without
significance.
the
--
i've
explained
why
the
suggestion
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
made
in
the
footnote,
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
called
attention
that
there
might
conceivably
be
--
the
argument
might
be
made
that
there's
an
implied
license
is
no
longer
valid
because
in
1932
that
was
explicitly
excluded.
logically,
i
should
say,
the
suggestion
of
an
implied
license
underscores
the
conclusion
that
the
hotel
or
aiken
was
performing
and
performing
publicly
for
profit,
because
if
it
was
not
performing
or
not
performing
publicly
for
profit,
there'd
be
no
point
in
talking
about
a
license.
it's
only
public
performance
for
profit
that
requires
a
license,
so
mr.
justice
brandeis'
discussion
of
a
possible
implied
license
necessarily
emphasizes
his
view
that
there
was
a
performance
and
of
course
a
performance
for
profit.
now,
the
third
circuit
seemed
to
be
under
the
impression
that
jewell-lasalle
had
been
overruled
by
this
court.
and
i
believe
that
therein,
again
i
find
myself
in
sharp
disagreement
with
that
court.
i
suppose
it
can
not
be
challenged
that
this
court
has
never
yet
uttered
the
talismanic
phrase
which
actually
would
decanonize
jewell-lasalle.
this
court
had
said
in
fortnightly
that
jewell-lasalle
should
be
understood
as
limited
to
its
own
facts.
the
facts
here
are
the
very
facts
to
which
the
court
said
it
should
be
limited
to,
and
that
is
the
very
converse
of
treating
it
as
overruled.
words
of
limitation
to
facts,
a
phrase
not
unusual
in
the
opinions
of
this
court,
i've
always
thought
meant
that
the
principle
of
the
case
may
no
longer
be
regarded
as
an
axiom
from
which
new
theorems
and
new
propositions
might
logically
be
deduced.
the
court
of
appeals
went
much
further
than
that.
it
has
acted
in
reliance
on
the
anticipation
that
this
court
will
overrule
jewell,
and
we
entertain
the
hope
that
that
prophecy
is
not
a
valid
one.
be
contend
that
the
court
should
not
overrule
jewell.
indeed
we
assert
that
this
case
presents
a
conspicuous
example
of
the
salutary
purposes
of
the
rule
of
stare
decisis.
for
instance,
i've
already
mentioned,
very
many
people
have
shaped
their
business
conduct
in
observance
of
and
in
reliance
on
that
case.
moreover,
the
rule
offends
no
moral
principle.
it
does
not
offend
good
judgment
as
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
all
over
the
world,
jewell-lasalle
is
in
fact
lived
by
and
if
it
should
appear
that
this
court
thinks
that
some
different
policy
should
now
prevail,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
proper
agency
to
grapple
with
that
is
the
congress,
and
indeed
the
congress
is
grappling
with
that
problem
at
this
very
moment.
as
your
honors
know,
the
copyright
act
has
been
under
active
consideration
by
the
congress
for
some
time,
and
the
delay
in
the
new
bill
has
been
not
jewell-lasalle,
but
the
delay
has
been
caused
by
the
inability
of
the
congress
to
decide
what
to
do
about
catv.
fortnightly,
the
first
catv
case,
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
jewell
decision
was
ever
questioned
in
this
court.
in
that
case,
there
were
a
number
--
there
was
one
dissent
and
three
nonparticipants.
in
that
case
the
court
confronted
a
brand
new
industry
which
had
never
been
subjected
to
the
copyright
system,
a
new
technology.
and
then
in
1974,
the
court
encountered
another
further
development
of
that
same
technology
in
fortnightly
which
brought
signals
beyond
the
realm
of
the
original
antennae.
but
neither
of
the
majority
nor
the
minority
in
either
of
those
cases
suggested
that
jewell
should
be
overruled.
the
majority
never
even
mentioned
jewell
in
the
last
teleprompter
case,
and
no
justice
to
express
the
thought
that
hotel
keepers
and
restaurateurs
were
free
to
entertain
guests
and
stimulate
employees
by
the
free
use
of
their
music.
aiken's
behavior
belongs
to
the
unsophisticated
realm
of
what
we
are
fully
familiar
with,
and
it
wouldn't
be
a
bad
idea
therefore
to
see
how
the
world
regards
that
kind
of
behavior.
i
shall
be
brief
and
say
that
great
britain,
canada,
new
zealand,
australia,
france,
germany
and
every
other
country
i
could
find
any
evidence
of
treats
aiken's
performance
as
a
breach
of
the
copyright
privilege.
in
the
functional
sense
which
is
the
idea
introduced
into
this
field
by
the
decisions
in
fortnightly
and
teleprompter,
comparison
was
made
to
the
viewer
erecting
a
giant
antennae.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
another
way
to
look
at
it
would
be
as
if
it
was
a
giant
ear
trumpet
which
made
it
possible
for
the
listener
to
get
signals
which
otherwise
he
couldn't
hear.
and
here's
the
point
i
want
to
make
the
distinction
between
those
two
kinds
of
cases.
the
purveyor
of
ear
trumpets
doesn't
exploit
music
even
though
he
sells
them
on
the
lobby
of
the
opera
house,
but
the
furnisher
of
music
to
his
costumers
does
exploit
music
no
matter
by
what
means
as
long
as
they're
within
his
control
that
he
brings
it
to
bear
upon
business
guests
and
his
business
employees.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
that's
a
--
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
fair
question.
i
think
the
real
question
is,
is
the
barber
playing
that
music
for
his
own
entertainment
or
is
he
doing
it
for
business
purpose?
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
and
i
will
only
report
the
practice.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
the
practice
has
been
to
impose
no
royalty
charge
on
the
one
set
type
of
operation.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
because
it
is
impossible
to
draw
the
line
on
a
nationwide
basis
--
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
i
draw
a
line
between
the
self-entertainment
and
the
business
entertainment.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
this
is
the
barbershop
and
the
barber
of
course
can
entertain
himself
as
well
as
his
costumers.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
not
when
he
puts
in
5
or
50
or
100
loudspeakers.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
it
is
to
some
extent,
a
practical
accommodation
to
the
facts
of
life
that
you
go
in
to
a
small
grocer
who
has
a
little
set
on
his
counter
which
he
amuses
himself,
papa
and
mama
are
running
an
establishment,
we
say
that's
for
their
personal
entertainment
and
only
incidentally
if
at
all
for
business
purposes.
when
you
take
a
restaurant
and
install
3,
4
or
5
or
50
loudspeakers,
we
say
that's
a
business
exploitation
of
the
music.
now,
all
questions
of
this
kind
involve
--
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
each
is
a
performance,
but
it
is
hard
to
see
that
you
can
say
with
assurance
in
any
particular
occasion,
your
honor
suggest
to
me
one
way
stipulated
that
he's
doing
it
for
business
purposes.
i
think
if
it
was
stipulated
for
business
purposes,
then
technically
speaking
he
would
be
performing
publicly
for
profit
and
be
subject
to
a
charge.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
no
licensing
organization
that
i
know
of
has
ever
pursued
such
a
course
of
conduct.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
same
thing.
no
one
set
type
that
is
usually
used
in
the
home
has
ever
been
subjected
to
a
royalty
or
to
a
license
requirement.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
no,
i
say
if
the
home
type
of
radio
has
ever
been
subjected,
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
man
would
have
in
his
home,
and
the
congress
recognizes
the
distinction
in
all
of
the
new
bills
that
have
been
introduced.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
not
yet.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
the
house
has
passed
a
bill
in
'67.
the
senate
passed
a
bill
in
'74.
they
are
substantially
the
same
on
this.
the
senate's
bill
was
passed
i
think
by
a
majority
of
70
to
1.
they
recognized
the
principle
of
jewell-lasalle,
both
bills
do.
and
the
thing
that
has
slowed
down
the
enactment
is
been
the
problem
with
the
catv
stations.
i
will
suspend
if
i
may
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
response.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
may
i
take
advantage
of
the
few
minutes
that
i
have.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
i
gathered
as
i
listened
to
my
learned
friend
that
there
might
be
a
distinction
drawn
between
jewell-lasalle
in
this
case
and
that
the
station
in
jewell-lasalle,
the
broadcast
station
was
unlicensed
and
here
it
is
licensed.
i
think
the
argument
advanced
by
one
of
the
dissenting
justices
in
fortnightly,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
simion
h.
rifkind
the
only,
excuse
me,
of
course
you
are
right.
i
was
thinking
for
a
moment
of
teleprompter.
in
fortnightly,
he
pointed
out
that
the
interpretation
of
the
term
performed
cannot
logically
turn
on
the
question
on
whether
the
material
that
is
used
is
licensed
or
not
licensed.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
of
meeting
that
logical
proposition.
more
importantly,
we
have
the
distinction
of
a
non-licensed
station
was
a
judicially
first
noticed
and
abandoned
back
in
1937
when
judge
woolsey
in
the
southern
district
decided
the
hotel
statler
case,
and
since
then
and
before
then
never
once
in
all
the
literature
of
this
subject,
in
all
the
discussions
of
the
copyright
office,
in
all
the
legislative
discussion
has
there
been
so
much
of
a
trace
of
a
distinction
attributable
to
this
coincidental
fact.
i
can
see
how
logically
it
can
play
the
role.
i
heard
the
argument
advanced
that
perhaps
aiken's
performance
was
not
for
profit.
you
heard
a
suggestion
that
the
costumers
only
spent
a
little
bit
of
time
there
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
well,
on
the
merits
of
course
that
issue
has
been
resolved
by
herbert
against
shanley
where
mr.
justice
holmes
made
a
cogent
remark
“it
is
true
that
music
is
not
the
sole
object
and
neither
is
the
food”
he
said.
if
music
didn't
pay,
it
would
be
given
up.
mr.
aiken
spent
money
to
furnish
music
to
his
costumers.
he
must
have
regarded
it
as
money
well
spent.
i
say,
the
issue
below
was
treated
as
established.
indeed
it
was
not
challenged
seriously
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
so
that
the
issue
is
not
really
in
this
court.
the
petition
for
cert
didn't
mention
it
or
neither
did
the
answer
to
the
petition
for
cert.
to
suggest
now
at
this
late
stage
of
this
case
that
this
court
should
consider
whether
only
music
which
is
offered
for
sale
by
a
ticket
at
the
door
is
within
the
copyright
statutes,
i
think
that
that's
to
extend
the
implications
of
this
case
far
beyond
what
we
are
now
confronting.
there
was
a
question
as
to
how
many
licenses
of
this
kind
were
outstanding
and
the
figure
was
given
correctly,
over
5000,
but
what
was
not
stated
that
there
are
75,000
establishments
which
used
music,
so
i
do
not
know
and
have
no
evidence
of
any
information
that
there
are
lots
of
aikens
around
this
country.
but
even
if
there
were,
that
wouldn't
change
the
fact
if
the
copyright
owners
have
a
right
against
aiken,
they
have
a
right
to
enforce
it.
the
suggestion
was
made
that
even
though
the
implication
of
an
--
the
suggestion
of
an
implied
license
is
no
longer
tenable,
in
fact
because
the
license
to
the
radio
station
expressly
excluded
it
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
doctrine
by
which
ascap
was
prohibited
from
entering
to
that
kind
of
an
arrangement
with
the
broadcast
station.
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
that's
a
startling
notion.
every
time
a
piece
of
cheap
music
is
installed
at
the
corner
store,
it
is
--
gives
confers
authority
upon
the
buyer
to
play
it
on
his
home.
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
may
give
a
performance
for
profit
on
that
cheap
music
and
escape
royalty
obligations.
