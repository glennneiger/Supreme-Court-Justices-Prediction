justice
william

rehnquist
there
was
no
possibility
of
any
implied
license
then,
as
that
was
referred
to
in
the
jewell-lasalle.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
rifkind
says
they've
been
doing
that
for
40
years
and
they've
been
doing
it
on
the
authority
of
jewell-lasalle.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
include
muzak,
the
5000
figure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
case
is
factually
distinguishable
from
jewell-lasalle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
any
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rational
manner.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
the
terms
of
the
license
of
the
broadcasting
station
negated
any
authority
on
its
part
to
license
anyone
else?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
think
this
court
in
jewell,
in
teleprompter
rather,
intended
to
overrule
jewell-lasalle
which
was
a
unanimous
statutory
decision
on
which
presumably
property
rights
have
been
established?
