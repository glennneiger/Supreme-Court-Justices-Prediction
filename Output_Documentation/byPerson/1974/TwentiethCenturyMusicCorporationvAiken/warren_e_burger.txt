chief

mr.
rifkind,
i'm
not
sure
it's
terribly
important
but
i
could
not
find
in
the
record
the
aggregate
number
of
loudspeaker
outlets
in
all
of
his
establishments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
five?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
just
in
one
restaurant,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
has
only
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
not
there
one
difference,
mr.
rifkind,
in
this
sense
possibly,
to
the
question,
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
since
the
radio
station
is
selling
advertising,
presumably,
and
i
would
assume
that
as
a
matter
of
economics,
the
advertising
rate
is
based
upon
the
coverage
of
the
radio
station
that
it
differs
from
the
orchestra
in
the
sense
that
the
orchestra
has
no
advertising,
and
the
radio
station
is
getting
--
radio
station
having
paid
the
royalty
is
getting
a
larger
income
because
of
the
standard
audience
of
restaurants,
hotels,
business
establishments,
etcetera.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
rifkind.
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
see,
if
i
understood
your
illustration,
mr.
cohen.
if
the
restaurant
or
store
or
factory
took
a
typical
tape
recording
machine
which
many
people
now
use
to
preserve
good
programs,
and
copied
all
the
good
programs
that
he
thought
his
costumers
would
like
and
eliminated
the
advertising,
and
then
had
those
running
by
five
loudspeakers
or
three
or
ten
within
his
establishment,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
might
run
afoul
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
buck
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
would
be
like
copying
recordings
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
have
to
pay
a
royalty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
what
you
said
mr.
cohen
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
all
of
your
arguments
would
apply
equally
to
the
factual
situation
we
have
here,
and
a
hypothetical
restaurant
let
us
say
sits
a
thousand
people
as
there
are
such
with
20
different
rooms,
and
in
each
room
there
was
one
outlet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
rebuttal,
mr.
rifkind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
dissenting
justice,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
