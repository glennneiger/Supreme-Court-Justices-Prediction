mr.
harold
david
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
argument
of
my
distinguished
adversary
has
a
captivating
sound,
but
essentially
i
believe
it
begs
the
very
question
in
dispute.
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
has
put
his
finger
on
the
point.
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
deciding
that
when
mr.
aiken
in
his
fast
food
shop
where
he
has
people
in
for
not
more
than
15
minutes
at
the
most,
60%
of
the
costumers
come
in
to
pickup
the
delicatessen
and
take
it
out
within
two
or
three
minutes,
if
they
decide
to
consume
it
on
the
premises,
then
they
can
take
it
on
disposable
paper
over
to
a
counter.
no
waitresses
are
supplied
and
they
can
stay
there
and
eat
it,
and
it's
usually
about
10
minutes,
a
maximum
of
15
minutes.
i
would
agree
with
my
learned
brother
that
if
mr.
aiken
hired
the
pittsburgh
symphony
orchestra
to
perform
in
his
fast
food
establishment,
or
a
trio
of
musicians,
or
he
put
in
complicated
equipment
whereby
he
could
go
out
and
buy
tapes,
select
tapes
and
decide
when
they
should
be
run
without
commercials,
and
perhaps
with
some
advertisements
for
aiken's
that
he
might
well
be
chargeable
with
infringing
the
copyrights
of
the
music
he
performed,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
we
are
concerned
with
the
simple
question
whether
on
this
particular
day
on
this
one
store
and
the
record
deals
only
with
one
store,
and
i
think
it
is
a
euphemism
to
call
it
a
restaurant.
whether
on
this
day
he
engaged
in
a
performance
of
ascap's
two
musical
compositions
when
he
turned
his
radio
to
an
fm
station
in
pittsburgh
and
the
radio
broadcast
came
through
the
air
to
his
store
and
were
heard
by
his
three
employees
and
such
costumers
as
happened
incidentally
to
be
on
the
premises.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
yes
there
is
--
mr.
harold
david
cohen
no,
not
at
the
buck
case.
the
buck
case
had
to
do
with
radio
broadcast.
i
think
it
might
run
afoul
of
another
provision
or
section
apart
of
section
1
(e)
of
the
copyright
act.
that
is,
there
is
an
exclusive
right
to
record
performances
and
i
think
if
there
were
tapes
or
records,
that
might
be
an
infringement.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
but
in
this
instance,
he
has
no
control
over
what
comes
in.
the
broadcasters
as
this
court
has
stated
in
the
fortnightly
case
and
repeated
in
the
teleprompter
case,
are
performing.
they
are
the
ones
who
go
out
and
select
the
programs.
they're
the
ones
who
make
the
arrangements
with
the
talent
sources,
with
the
record
companies,
with
ascap
and
other
performing
rights
organizations.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
they
pay
ascap
for
their
royalties.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
they
charge
their
costumers
--
mr.
harold
david
cohen
exactly.
and
i'm
sure
that
when
this
fm
station
goes
out
and
makes
the
pitch
to
the
advertiser,
he
says
“we
can
reach
people
whether
they're
at
their
home,
or
in
their
cars
driving
to
from
their
homes,
or
whether
they're
in
stores,
or
whether
they're
waiting
in
doctors'
offices,
or
whether
they're
sitting
on
a
barber's
chair,
or
wherever.”
in
other
words,
he
tries
to
maximize
his
audience
so
that
his
revenues
will
be
greater,
and
in
turn
ascap
profits
because
the
amount
which
it
receives
from
the
broadcaster
is
the
percentage
of
the
broadcaster's
revenues.
so
what
in
effect
they
are
trying
to
do
here
stripped
of
some
of
the
language
is
to
exact
the
double
payment.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
when
they
go
to
the
broadcaster
they
say,
“well,
we're
not
going
to
charge
you
as
much
as
we
otherwise
might
because
we're
going
to
get
mr.
aiken
to
give
us
$60.00
a
year.
so
we're
going
to
take
or
deduct
that
from
the
amount
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
pay.”
mr.
harold
david
cohen
it's
curious
indeed
that
if
for
40
years
they
have
been
doing
it,
they
have
5,150
licenses.
i
think
we
can
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
establishments
in
this
country
like
mr.
aiken's.
barbershops,
beauty
salons,
doctors'
offices
if
you
will,
restaurants
and
if
they
have
5000
licenses
and
these
are
hotels
and
motels
and
large
supermarkets
and
the
like,
it
does
not
show
that
they
have
vigorously
relied
upon
jewell-lasalle
as
a
basis
for
--
mr.
harold
david
cohen
no
the
5000
figure
does
not
include
muzak.
muzak
is
a
performer.
that
is
the
muzak
franchisee
which
supplies
or
actually
performs
a
muzak
to
the
business
establishment,
does
perform,
does
pay
a
royalty
to
ascap
and
that
is
separate,
and
that
will
continue
to
be
paid
in
whatever
amount
the
court
may
deem
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory.
that
will
continue
to
be
paid
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
it's
factually
distinguishable
--
mr.
harold
david
cohen
on
two
grounds.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
well,
certainly
the
ground
that
you
indicated
namely,
the
license
implied
in
this
case
--
which
may
be
implied
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
broadcasting
station
was
authorized
in
pittsburgh,
whereas
the
broadcasting
station
in
kansas
city
in
the
jewell-lasalle
case
was
not
authorized
by
the
copyright
owners,
is
a
significant
point
of
distinction.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
necessarily
a
license
implied
in
fact,
but
there's
certainly
is
a
license
implied
in
law.
i
do
not
believe
that
ascap
can
contrive
language
whereby
they
can
say
this,
a
broadcaster
“we
are
going
to
license
you
to
broadcast
that
is
disseminate
to
the
public
our
compositions,
and
we
want
you
to
pay
us
a
royalty.”
these
are
to
go
over
the
air
to
all
members
to
the
public
and
then
say
that
mr.
aiken
or
his
costumers
who
are
members
to
the
public
can
not
receive
those
broadcast
without
payment
of
the
fee.
another
point
of
distinction
of
course
is
that
if
we
got
into
the
quantitative
test,
which
of
course
has
since
been
discarded
by
this
court.
obviously,
what
mr.
aiken
has
done
in
his
store,
which
is
a
small
room
with
two
outfits
on
the
ceiling
of
the
public
area
or
two
speakers
are
located,
and
three
other
speakers,
one
on
the
washroom,
the
girl's
washroom,
one
in
the
kitchen
and
one
at
the
office
for
his
employees
is
vastly
different
from
the
complicated
mechanism
of
the
large
master
radio
receiving
set
in
jewell-lasalle
which
piped
muzak
to
200
rooms
throughout
the
hotel.
or
in
the
statler
hotel
case
in
new
york
where
they
had
a
radio
engineer
and
two
assistants
on
top
of
the
building
and
they
piped
music
through
the
ducts
to
1900
rooms,
and
there
they
held
it
was
a
performance
upon
the
authority
of
jewell-lasalle.
that
is
not
this
case.
however,
i
am
not
relying
upon
that
because
i
think
this
court
has
clearly
stated
in
the
teleprompter
case
and
on
the
fortnightly
case
before,
that
viewers
of
television
and
by
a
parody
of
reasoning,
listeners
to
radio
broadcast
do
not
perform,
the
broadcasters
perform.
it's
difficult
to
conceive
functionally
how
mr.
aiken
can
be
said
to
be
performing
music
in
his
establishment
when
he
has
no
control
over
what
is
being
broadcast,
when
it
is
being
broadcast.
he
has
no
dealings
with
advertisers.
he
has
no
idea
of
the
tempo
of
the
music
or
the
kind
of
the
music
that
is
going,
coming
over,
except
as
mr.
--
judge
rifkind
pointed
out.
of
course
he
may
select
one
station
because
he
thinks
it
may
be
more
pleasing
to
him
or
people
in
his
store,
particularly
his
employees
than
another
station.
but
the
fact
is,
he
does
not
attempt
to
edit
anything
that
comes
over.
he
gets
the
commercial
announcements.
he
gets
the
station
identifications,
the
public
service
announcements,
the
news,
as
well
as
the
music.
i'm
sure
that
it
would
put
an
unbearable
strain
upon
the
ordinary
meaning
of
performance.
perhaps
someone
sitting
in
mr.
aiken's
shop
consuming
a
hamburger
regard
mr.
aiken
as
a
performer
of
the
music.
this
music
is
coming
to
you
from
station
wkjf
fm,
and
there
is
nothing
that
mr.
aiken
does
to
intervene
between
that
broadcast
and
the
listening
by
the
people
primarily
his
employees.
incidentally
--
mr.
harold
david
cohen
yup?
mr.
harold
david
cohen
well,
the
record
player
i
would
say
--
mr.
harold
david
cohen
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
that
would
be
a
performance
because
of
the
special
provision
on
the
statute,
but
if
he
has
a
record
player
or
tape
machine,
he
goes
out
and
buys
the
tapes
or
rents
the
tapes.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
selects
what
he
wants,
has
control
over
what
is
being
sent
out.
and
presumably,
he
can
intersperse
his
own
commercial
announcements.
he
may
say
“from
the
next
five
minutes
you
can
get
aiken's
chicken
at
10%
off.”
he
could
not
do
it
here,
he
--
mr.
harold
david
cohen
yes.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
well,
the
jukebox
there's
a
special
exemption
for
jukebox
in
the
law
which
congress
is
trying
to
modify
to
have
an
$8.00
jukebox
charge
imposed.
so
far
as
the
legislation
is
concerned
upon
which
mr.
rifkind
depends,
i
think
it's
pretty
hard
to
find
in
the
silence
of
congress
over
these
last
10,
15
years
any
indication
that
jewell-lasalle
must
be
adhered
to,
otherwise
this
entire
complex
of
business
relationships
is
going
to
fall.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
well,
obviously
this
court
did
not
use
the
word
overrule
and
i
think
the
supreme
court
generally
is
reluctant
to
state
explicitly
that
a
former
decision
of
the
court
is
overruled.
but
to
say
that
jewell-lasalle
must
be
understood
to
be
limited
to
its
own
factual
context
and
to
undermine
the
basic
rationale
of
jewell-lasalle,
the
basic
premise
on
which
jewell-lasalle
was
decided,
namely
that
there
is
a
performance
because
of
this
--
of
what
the
hotel
did
by
having
this
elaborate
equipment
and
substitute
the
functional
analysis
test
of
fortnightly
and
teleprompter,
obviously
in
effect
emasculates
jewell-lasalle.
the
vitality
of
jewell-lasalle
is
not
what
it
was
prior
to
the
fortnightly
decision.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
right.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
that
was
an
important
fact
as
i
pointed
out
previously.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
that
is
right.
now
--
mr.
harold
david
cohen
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
yes.
if
it
used
radio
broadcast,
i
think
it
would
logically.
the
difference
comes
of
course
a
restaurant
of
that
kind
as
the
restaurant
in
the
herbert
v.
shanley
case
to
which
my
adversary
eluded,
may
go
in
for
a
much
different
type
of
entertainment.
to
say
that
the
business
motivation
of
mr.
aiken
is
like
that
of
a
hotel
owner
in
herbert
v.
shanley,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
fictional.
the
vanderbilt
hotel
in
new
york
was
concerned
with
the
ambiance
of
its
hotel
restaurant
so
it
had
an
orchestra
play,
and
it
had
undoubtedly
liveried
waiters,
and
it
had
fine
napkins
and
tablecloths.
that
is
not
true
of
an
establishment
of
this
kind
which
is
willing
to
have
just
the
radio
come
in
and
have
two
speakers
in
the
public
area
where
the
sound
can
be
audible
evenly
throughout
the
premises.
the
point
is
that
my
adversary
is
attempting
to
draw
a
line
which
i
think
is
an
arbitrary
one
--
artificial
one
between
having
a
radio
behind
the
counter
encased
in
one
cabinet
that
is
it
might
have
one
speaker
or
two
speakers,
and
that
would
not
be
a
performance.
but
he
did
have
that
in
this
particular
shop,
but
he
found
it
to
be
blared
if
you
were
close
to
it
if
you
heard
it
too
loudly,
if
you
were
a
little
further
away
you
might
not
hear
it
as
well.
and
that
blare
did
interfere
with
conversations
with
costumers,
so
instead
he
had
speakers.
i
was
not
unusual,
these
days
i'm
told,
in
fact
it's
quite
common
when
you
buy
a
radio
to
have
speakers
outside
of
the
tuning
device
and
you
might
put
them
ten
feet
away,
you
may
have
them
the
other
part
of
the
room,
you
may
put
it
in
another
room.
but
so
far
as
mr.
aiken's
“performance”
is
concerned,
he
did
nothing
more
than
install
this
equipment.
he
did
not
manipulate
it
once
it
was
installed
and
is
no
different
than
if
he
had
just
one
unit
with
the
speakers
incased
in
a
cabinet
so
far
as
his
function
relative
to
the
broadcast
were
concerned
--
was
concerned.
i
think
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
the
fortnightly
and
teleprompter
cases
is
dispositive
of
ascap's
claim.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
perceive
it
to
be.
it's
certainly
illogical,
i
would
think
to
be
clear
that
the
function
of
a
cable
system
has
little
in
common
with
the
function
of
a
broadcaster,
because
like
viewers
and
unlike
broadcasters,
they
do
not
perform
the
programs
they
receive
and
carry,
and
then
turn
around
and
hold
mr.
aiken
to
be
engaged
in
a
performance.
mr.
aiken
is
obviously
on
the
listening
side
of
the
line.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
fortnightly
case
and
teleprompter,
many
catv
systems
serve
commercial
establishments
as
well
as
subscribers
in
there
homes,
to
say
on
the
one
hand
that
the
catv
system
is
on
the
listening
side
or
the
viewing
side
of
the
line,
but
mr.
aiken
who
is
a
subscriber
jumps
over
to
the
performing
side
of
the
line,
seems
to
me
to
be
arbitrary.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
well,
the
proposed
new
statute
is
rather
complicated.
i
must
take
issue
with
my
friend
judge
rifkind.
mr.
harold
david
cohen
i
think
the
new
statute
attempts
and
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
establishments
such
as
aiken's,
small
establishment
or
barbershops
or
so
forth,
would
not
be
subject
to
liability.
and
also,
i
may
point
out
that
the
statute
provides
that
there
maybe
transmissions
even
by
a
hotel
to
guest
rooms
without
incurring
any
copyright
liability.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
legislative
history
will
disclose
that
even
ascap,
judge
rifkind's
client
did
not
attempt
to
enforce
jewell-lasalle
against
hotels
which
piped
music
to
guest
rooms.
after
the
statler
case
in
new
york
was
a
victory
for
scsaczak
which
is
a
counterpart
of
ascap,
there
apparently
was
some
question
whether
this
was
a
performance
for
profit.
at
any
rate,
the
legislative
history
discloses
that
there
was
very
little
attempt
to
enforce
the
rights
of
the
performing
rights
organization
against
hotels
which
transmitted
programs
to
private
rooms
in
hotel
even
though
jewell-lasalle
presumably
gave
them
that
right
under
the
jewell-lasalle
construction
of
the
1909
act.
so,
the
answer
to
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
i
would
be
foolhardy
if
i
attempted
to
prognosticate
the
effect
of
pending
legislation.
as
you
know,
there
has
been
--
they
have
been
studying
the
revision
of
the
copyright
law
since
1955.
there
was
an
authorization
from
congress
to
the
copyright
office,
extensive
studies
were
made,
there
was,
i
refer
to
a
report
in
1961
as
being
the
culmination
of
studies,
but
my
opponent's
reply
brief
says
it
was
not
the
culmination
but
of
course
the
foreword,
though
the
report
said,
it
is
the
culmination
of
studies.
at
any
rate,
there
were
a
lot
of
comments
and
discussions
and
compromises
and
they
came
out
with
a
statute.
it
passed
one
house,
as
judge
rifkind
pointed
out,
did
not
pass
the
other.
i
do
not
know
what
may
eventually
come
out
of
this.
but
certainly,
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
construction
of
an
existing
statute,
and
if
this
court
in
1931
decided
a
case
on
a
premise
or
a
doctrine
which
has
been
found
not
to
be
sound,
not
to
be
logical,
it
should
be
the
responsibility
of
this
court
to
correct
that
decision
not
to
wait
for
congress
to
correct
it.
thank
you.
