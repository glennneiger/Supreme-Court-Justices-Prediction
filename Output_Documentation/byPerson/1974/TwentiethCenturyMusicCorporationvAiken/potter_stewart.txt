go
to
a
barbershop
and
the
radio
is
turned
on,
a
three-chair
barbershop,
does
the
barber
have
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
pay
ascap
license?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
the
facts
are
stipulated
that
he's
doing
it
for
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
pleasant
reaction
of
his
costumers.
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
drawing
the
line.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
impossible?
you've
just
told
us
you've
drawn
a
line.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
this
is
a
barbershop
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
restauranteur
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
is
four
or
you
say
five,
the
record
seems
to
indicate
four.
but
what
is
the
difference?
why
do
you
draw
the
line?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
this
one
is
a
performance,
so
is
the
other,
is
it
not?
each
is
a
performance
and
that's
a
critical
word
under
the
statute,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
dentist's
office?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
we're
not
talking
about
a
home,
we're
talking
about
public
performance.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
congress
hasn't
enacted
any?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
hasn't
recognized
any
of
these
things?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
pay
for
the
licenses?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
charge
their
own
costumers
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
basis
of
how
large
listening
audience
they
have?
justice
potter
stewart
but
even
if
he
doesn't,
that's
a
performance,
isn't
it?
that's
clearly
a
performance.
justice
potter
stewart
a
jukebox,
so
called.
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
cohen
it's
--
i
think
the
phrase
was
its
limited
--
must
be
limited
to
its
own
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
and
one
of
the
facts
on
jewell-lasalle
was
that
the
broadcasting
station
was
unlicensed
to
sell.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
one
of
its
own
facts.
justice

stewart
in
the
second

that
i
am
authorized

74-452,
twentieth
century
music
corporation
and
others,
against
george
aiken.
we
have
a
case
that's
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
respondent
george
aiken
owns
and
operates
a
small
fast-service
food
shop
in
downtown
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania,
known
as
"george
aiken's
chicken."
a
radio
with
outlets
to
four
speakers
in
the
ceiling
receives
broadcasts
of
music
and
other
normal
radio
programming
at
this
small
restaurant.
aiken
usually
turns
on
the
radio
each
morning
at
the
start
of
business.
music,
news,
entertainment,
and
commercial
advertising
broadcast
by
radio
stations
are
thus
heard
by
aiken,
his
employees,
and
his
customers
during
the
hours
that
the
establishment
is
open
for
business.
in
march
--
on
march
11,
1972,
broadcasts
of
two
copyrighted
musical
compositions
were
received
on
the
radio
from
a
local
station
while
several
customers
were
in
aiken's
establishment.
the
petitioner
twentieth
century
music
corporation
owns
the
copyright
on
one
of
these
songs
and
the
petitioner
mary
bourne
the
copyright
on
the
other.
both
the
petitioners
are
members
of
ascap,
which
is
an
association
that
licenses
the
performing
rights
of
its
members
to
their
copyrighted
works.
the
station
that
broadcast
the
petitioners'
songs
was
licensed
by
ascap
to
broadcast
them.
aiken,
on
the
other
hand
did
not
hold
a
license
from
ascap.
the
petitioners
sued
aiken
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
to
recover
for
copyright
infringement.
their
complaint
alleged
that
the
radio
reception
in
aiken's
restaurant
of
the
licensed
broadcasts
infringed
their
exclusive
rights
to
"perform"
their
copyrighted
works
in
public
for
profit.
the
district
judge
agreed,
and
granted
the
plaintiffs
statutory
monetary
awards
for
each
infringement.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
that
judgment,
holding
that
the
petitioners'
claims
against
the
respondent
were
--
were
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decisions
in
two
recent
cases,
the
fortnightly
case
reported
in
volume
392
of
the
united
states
reports
and
the
teleprompter
case
reported
in
volume
415
of
those
reports.
for
the
reason
set
out
in
a
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
on
the
result
and
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
douglas
has
joined.
