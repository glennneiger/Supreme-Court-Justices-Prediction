justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
commission
had
set
a
schedule
of
fees
ordered
it
into
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
it
did
had
the
power
to
do
it
then,
up
today
it
hasn't
done
it
but
then
all
of
the
sudden
it
does
ordered
into
effect,
would
you
then
say
that
the
antitrust
division
would
be
put
on
a
business
for
awhile
at
least?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
it
is
until
it
does
that
there
is
no
--
it
isn't
necessary.
they
haven't
done
it
and
it's
so
it
can't
be
necessary?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you,
does
the
exchange
or
does
the
commission
purport
to
have
any
authority
to
adjudicate
particular
violations
of
its
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
commission
did
put
out
--
assume
it
had
the
power
to
and
that
that
it
did
propound
a
minimum
charge
for
brokers
and
then
an
individual
broker
didn't
live
up
to
the
rule,
could
the
commission
move
against
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
your
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
by
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
what
page
mr.
shapiro?
page
48
of
your
brief
you
say,
if
the
sec
where
the
quarter
the
exchanges
to
adhere
to
a
fixed
commission
rate
system
of
some
kind
no
antitrust
liability
could
arise
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
what
you're
telling
is
that
is
the
only
situation
where
immunity
is
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
other
situation
anything
short
of
that
than
the
silver
tests.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
minute
if
the
court
would
hold
that
the
power
given
to
the
sec
whether
exercised
or
not
preempts
the
antitrust
law
and
whether
the
commission
has
a
rule
or
whether
it
doesn't
or
whether
it
requires
price
fixing
or
whether
it
forbids
it
the
antitrust
law
this
would
have
no
application?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
immunity
in
this
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that's
the
position
of
some
people
in
this
case
that
this
reserve
is
granted
but
on
exercise
power
preempts
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
answer
silver.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what's
the
antitrust
situation
under
the
new
order
after
it
becomes
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
if
the
commission
doesn't
fix,
what
if
it's
just
a
power
which
has
been
granted
to
the
sec,
is
it
your
position
just
a
grant
of
the
power
--
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
--
whether
it
exercise
or
whether
it
does
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
consider
whether
it
permits
or
whether
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
suppose
the
commission
--
the
exchange
has
a
rule
which
it
does
on
commissions
and
the
sec
says
nothing
it
all
about
it,
you
say
the
antitrust
laws
have
nothing
to
do
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
commission
fixing,
i
mean
it
hasn't
fixed
anything
it
just
hasn't
disapprove
and
exchange
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
that
event,
does
the
sec
have
any
authority
to
enforce
specific
instant
of
violations
of
the
exchange
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
it
really
doesn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
so
--
if
the
commission
rule
is
--
if
the
exchange
rule
is
going
to
be
enforced
at
all,
the
exchange
enforces
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
certain
brokers
engaged
in
price
fixing
inconsistent
with
the
exchange
rule
that's
an
exchange
matter,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
commission
comes
along
to
“thou
shalt
not”?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
its
sanctions
would
be
the
exclusive
sanctions
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
according
to
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
antitrust
laws
would
still
have
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no
effect,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
order
you
to
adopt
the
rule
really
that
shall
be
no
price
fixing
or
there
shall
be
no
uniform
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
what
they
did
and
so
it's
still
as
an
exchange
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
case
of
individual
violation
still
the
matter
for
the
exchange
to
enforce?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
please
tell
me
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
no
--
no
remedies
for
any
person
hurt
by
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
are
violations
of
the
exchange
rule
against
fixed
fees
and
someone
violates
it
and
somebody
is
hurt
by
it,
there
are
no
damage
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
exchange
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
then
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
authority
to
the
order
or
to
order
uniform
rates
or
to
order
non-uniform
rates
or
to
say
that
there
should
be
no
uniform
rates
and
to
say
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
exchange
rule
about
it.
the
commission's
jurisdiction
would
not
be
exclusive.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
power
of
the
commission
to
have
a
rule
under
enforcement
would
not
outstand
antitrust
laws
in
that
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
exchange
had
replaced
its
present
rule
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
directive
to
say
that
there
should
be
no
--
there
is
no
uniform
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
you
got
just
a
silver
--
you
got
the
antitrust
remedy
could
supplement
or
--
just
be
unaffected
by
the
security
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they're
conspiring,
it
would
be
contrary
to
an
exchange
rule,
the
antitrust
laws
could
still
go.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
security
and
exchange
commission
has
no
whatever
its
jurisdiction
is,
it
isn't
such
as
to
preclude
an
antitrust
remedy
in
those
--
on
those
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
what
about
the
situations
where
nothing
has
happened,
the
commission,
the
exchange
has
a
rule
and
the
sec
has
never
addresed
itself
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
has
the
power
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
say
a
word.
do
you
know
when
it
does
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
you
accept
the
test
in
silver
that
there
is
immunity
where
some
rule
is
essential
to
the
effectuation
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
test
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
within,
the
--
in
that
effect
--
your
position
as
to
then
that
anything
the
sec,
any
rule
the
sec
fails
to
disapprove
is
automatically
immune
from
antitrust
attack?
not
regardless
of
its
position,
its
overall
position
in
the
act
and
regardless
of
whether
or
the
sec
might
say,
“well,
it
just
isn't
harmful.”
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
entirely
a
different
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
find
that
in
silver
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
find
it
in
statute,
i
guess.
i
suppose
that's
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
there's
a
--
there's
something
beyond
--
i
don't
suppose
this
court
is
necessarily
bound
by
mr.
shapiro's
concession.
justice
byron
r.
white
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
part
of
his
argument
of
course
has
been
that
even
that
the
sec
approves
either
arguably
that
the
sec
approves
it
has
no
authority
at
all
to
immunize
under
the
antitrust
law,
so
that
it
has
no
responsibility
for
competitive
considerations
that
if
it
disapproves
that
wholly
within
the
scope
of
the
security's
laws
and
has
no
eye
to
and
no
authority
with
respect
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
been
the
whole
lead
in
some
other
context
with
some
other
agencies.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
decisions
to
whether
there's
repugnance?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
what's
the
matter
with
the
exchange?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
claim
that
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
not?
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
claim
--
let's
assume
that
the
claim
was
that
the
exchange
was
conniving
with
those
conspirators,
how
about
the
liability
of
the
exchange?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
today,
--
so
today,
if
there
were
some
--
if
two
or
three
of
the
--
any
kind
of
the
conspiracy
then
among
the
members
today
under
the
present,
even
under
the
rule
that
did
set
minimum
rates,
if
members
conspired
either
to
charge
higher
or
lower
prices
than
then,
you
wouldn't
think
--
you
would
say
that
the
antitrust
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
--
suppose
an
exchange
files
a
rule
with
you
and
you
look
at
over
and
you
don't
think
it
requires
any
approval
or
disapproval
or
you
just
don't
take
any
action?
you
say
that's
tantamount
to
an
approval.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you
issued
an
order.
is
that
--
how
can
anybody
get
review
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
get
that
and
i
understand.
you've
already
answered
that
i
think
earlier.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
it's
consistent
with
the
act,
do
you
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
it's
consistent
with
the
act
do
you
think
that
it's
--
that
it
ought
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
ever
know
when
that
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
do
we
--
how
would
you
know
when
you
decided
not
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
--
are
there
administrative
agencies
when
they
have
some
authority
to
take
any
consideration,
competitive
considerations,
you
have
a
hearing
and
you
get
the
--
somebody
has
a
chance
to
present
the
agency
some
of
the
competitive
considerations.
none
here,
zero
and
you
say
it's
not
reviewable,
would
it
be
reviewable
on
administrative
record
or
get
at
a
new
lawsuit
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
would
you
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
understood
in
the
--
with
all
about
six
times
and
it
wasn't
reviewable.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
give
me
some
advice
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
de
novo
thing?
can
you
make
a
new
record
there?
or
do
you
--
are
you
stuck
with
your
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
only
the
rule
here,
a
letter
a
came
in
and
gave
you
the
rule
and
that's
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
view,
could
he
present
evidence?
could
there
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
instructed
us
with
the
record
before
you.
