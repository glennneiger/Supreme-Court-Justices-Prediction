the
next
case,
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
may,
will
be
no.
74-304,
gordon
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange
because
it
is
somewhat
related
to
the
earlier
one.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
presents
the
not
uncommon
problem
of
reconciling
the
federal
antitrust
laws
with
a
federal
regulatory
scheme
this
time
in
the
particular
context
of
the
national
securities
exchanges
and
their
members
and
their
use
of
fixed
rates
of
commission.
the
petitioner
individually
and
on
behalf
of
an
asserted
class
of
small
investors
sued
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
the
american
stock
exchange
and
two
member
firms
and
claimed
that
the
system
of
fixed
commission
rates
utilized
by
the
exchanges
for
transactions
of
less
than
half
million
dollars
violated
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
concluded
that
the
fixed
commission
rates
were
immunized
from
antitrust
attack
because
of
the
specific
authority
of
the
sec
under
section
19
(b)
(9)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
to
disapprove
or
approve
commission
rates
and
the
sec's
exercise
of
that
power.
this
power
so
exercised
the
courts
concluded,
placed
the
rates
beyond
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
a
long
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
in
it,
we
endeavor
to
outline
in
detail
the
pervasive
supervision
both
by
way
of
power
and
by
way
of
active
regulation
of
the
sec
over
rates
particularly
in
the
last
15
years.
we
conclude
that
the
interposition
of
the
antitrust
laws
on
the
theory
that
they
bar
fixed
commission
rates
as
per
se
violations
of
the
sherman
act
would
unduly
interfere
with
the
intended
operation
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
this
case
in
other
words,
we
hold
is
the
different
case
referred
to
in
a
case
decided
here
a
decade
ago
called
silver
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
although
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court.
and
that
mr.
justice
stewart
also
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
