mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
the
extent
that
time
permits
today,
i
would
like
to
present
the
commission's
views
on
the
issue
in
this
case
by
discussing
three
points
and
in
doing
so,
address
myself
to
some
of
the
questions
asked
by
this
court
yesterday.
the
first
point
is
what
is
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
exchange
act
and
how
did
congress
deal
with
the
question
of
fixed
commission
rates
in
that
scheme?
the
second
is
how
does
that
regulatory
scheme
actually
work
at
the
sec
and
what
has
the
sec
been
doing
for
the
last
41
years
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
fixed
rates?
and
third,
why
to
use
this
court's
expression,
we
believe
a
plain
repugnancy
exists
between
two
regulatory
regimes
and
why
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
exchange
act
simply
will
not
work
as
congress
intended
it
if
antitrust
courts
are
given
the
opportunity
to
substitute
their
judgments
for
the
reason
to
regulatory
judgment
of
the
commission.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
the
exchange
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
no
we
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
we
don't
claim
the
authority
to
determine
a
repugnancy
issue.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
well,
on
the
first
instance,
your
honor,
we
applied
the
standards
of
the
act.
the
public
interest
standards
of
the
act
and
we
do
consider
competitive
considerations
but
we
also
consider
other
economic
considerations,
regulatory
considerations
and
the
other
considerations
under
the
act
and
then
take
action.
and
we
believe
that's
the
commission
exercising
its
jurisdiction
and
we
do
not
believe
that
then
our
action
should
be
attacked
collaterally
in
an
antitrust
action.
the
congress
gave
the
commission
specific
authority
under
the
34
act
to
do
several
things.
it
gave
it
specific
authority
to
adopt
rules,
mandatory
rules
concerning
financial
responsibility,
concerning
borrowing
practices,
concerning
manipulative
and
deceptive
practices
and
concerning
practically
every
other
important
thing
in
dealing
with
investor
protection.
and
the
congress
also
gave
the
sec
authority
to
register
stock
exchanges,
to
police
stock
exchanges
and
to
require
amendments
to
their
constitution
and
by-laws
as
the
commission
determines
necessary
in
the
interest
of
investor
protection.
now,
at
section
19
(b),
congress
gave
the
commission
jurisdiction
to
supervise
rules
and
required
changes
in
exchange
by-laws
and
rules
and
regulations
in
such
matters
as
12
enumerated
categories
in
similar
matters
including
specifically
the
authority
to
regulate
the
fixing
of
fixed
commission
by
exchanges.
and
that
subject
to
fixed
commissions
by
exchanges
had
been
142
years
old
in
1934
when
congress
addressed
itself
to
this
issue.
congress
argued
as
to
how
to
regulate
that
practice
not
whether
they
should
be
outlawed.
congress
chose
to
regulate
the
practice
by
subjecting
it
to
the
jurisdiction
of
its
new
federal
agency
like
so
many
other
things
it
did.
now,
in
the
act,
congress
gave
the
commission
a
variety
of
regulatory
tools.
it
gave
the
commission
authority
to
adopt
rules
and
impose
them
upon
the
industry.
it
gave
the
commission
authority
to
conduct
investigations,
hold
hearings
and
make
recommendations
to
the
industry
and
expect
them
to
follow
the
recommendations.
it
gave
it
authority
to
supervise
these
rules
and
to
require
changes.
it
gave
it
authority
to
issue
demand
letters
which
are
called
the
19
(b)
letters
of
request
in
effect
are
demands.
and
lastly,
it
gave
it
the
ultimate
club
by
giving
the
commission
authority
to
withdraw
or
suspend
the
registration
of
an
exchange
for
failure
to
follow
the
commission
rule,
order
or
regulation.
that
is
the
regulatory
scheme
we're
talking
about
today
and
it
is
the
regulatory
scheme
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
analyzed
in
the
ware
case
just
15
months
ago
in
talking
about
the
kinds
of
direct
supervisory
authority
the
sec
had
and
then
other
areas
like
ware,
like
silver
but
in
that
case
analyzed
that
there
should
be
a
repealer
when
we
are
talking
about
an
area
over
which
the
commission
has
direct
supervisory
jurisdiction
which
we
think
is
this
case.
now,
yesterday,
a
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
about
the
commission's
authority
to
take
action
against
a
member
of
an
exchange
for
violating
an
exchange
rule
and
that
--
and
the
question
to
that
--
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
there
are
four
parts
to
it.
the
commission
does
have
authority
to
take
action
directly
against
a
member
if
the
member
violates
the
exchange
act
or
an
sec
rule
or
regulation.
it
doesn't
specifically
refer
to
exchange
rules.
the
sec
does
have
specific
power
under
section
15
(b)
of
the
exchange
act
to
revoke
the
authority
of
a
member
to
do
business
in
the
security's
industry
if
it
violates
certain
conduct
in
that
fashion
but
again
it
doesn't
specifically
refer
to
exchange
rules.
thirdly,
if
that
conduct
in
violating
an
exchange
rule,
also
violated
another
rule
of
the
commission
or
of
the
statute
then
the
commission
has
direct
authority
under
section
21
to
bring
an
injunctive
action
against
that
member
for
violating
a
statute
or
a
rule
and
regulation
of
the
commission.
and
then
lastly,
of
course,
the
commission
has
the
authority
under
19
(a)
(1)
to
withdraw
the
registration
of
that
exchange
for
failure
to
comply,
or
forced
compliance
by
its
members
of
its
own
rules
which
the
commission
did
in
1966
revoke
in
the
registration
of
san
francisco
mining
exchange
for
among
other
things
just
that,
failing
to
require
compliance
by
exchange
members.
the
question
was
also
asked
yesterday
and
mr.
jackson
came
back
to
it
today
and
i
think
the
commission
would
like
to
make
its
position
clear
on
the
question
of
what
happens
after
may
1,
1975
when
we
have
said
there
shall
be
no
practice
of
fixed
rates.
we
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
precisely,
we
were
a
little
bit
puzzled
yesterday
by
mr.
jackson's
comment
but
today
we
agree
completely
that
after
may
1st,
if
we
have
adopted
a
rule
as
we
have
that
there
shall
be
no
--
that
the
exchanges
shall
have
not
rules
requiring
their
members
to
fixed
rates
and
if
the
members
thereafter
do
agreed
to
fix
their
rates,
high
or
low
or
wherever,
we
do
not
claim
that
the
existence
of
the
exchange
act,
the
presence
of
the
sec
repeals
or
exempts
antitrust
application
of
that
situation,
nor
indeed
would
we
if
members
did
something
like
that
today
even
in
a
fixed
rate
environment
because
members
can
charge
more
than
the
minimum
commission
rate.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
exactly,
it's
another
example
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
and
we
agree
and
we
would
not
claim
any
repealer
of
that
kind
of
anti-competitive
conduct.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
we
--
if
there
was
an
allegation
of
conniving
or
conspiracy
by
the
exchange
of
its
members,
we
would
say
the
mere
presence
of
the
sec
or
its
jurisdiction
would
not
exempt
the
antitrust
application.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
yes,
we
would
your
honor.
there
would
be
antitrust
liability
there
because
we
do
not
believe
that
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
collides
or
conflict
with
our
jurisdiction
in
that
case,
but
we
believe
that
supplementary
and
complementary
toward
jurisdiction.
we
are
concerned
about
those
acts
and
practices
and
rules
which
exchanges
and
their
members
operate
under
which
are
consistent
with
our
jurisdiction
and
consistent
with
our
policies,
not
inconsistent.
now,
the
second
aspect
of
our
presentation
is
to
just
describe
how
this
process
under
this
regulatory
scheme
works
in
practice.
our
brief
in
our
documentary
appendix
go
into
detail
to
describe
the
steps
taken
by
the
sec
over
the
last
41
years,
most
particularly
the
last
15
years
in
reviewing,
proving,
modifying,
changing
and
finally
eliminating
the
practice
of
fixed
rates.
these
studies
contained
in
practically
the
entire
documentary
appendix
and
indeed
most
of
the
appendix
of
the
petitioner,
these
studies,
hearings,
investigations,
19
(b)
letter,
demand
letters
have
resulted
1968
in
the
introduction
of
a
volume
discount
by
exchanges.
they
resulted
in
the
introduction
of
a
non-member
discount
in
1971,
permitting
persons
who
are
not
members
of
the
exchange
to
get
a
40%
discount
from
the
public
rate.
the
exchanges
in
that
situation
that
come
in
with
a
rule
proposing
a
30%
non-member
discount
and
we
said
no.
it
had
to
be
40%
and
the
exchange
adopted
a
40%
discount.
that's
how
this
process
works.
these
studies
and
these
letters
also
resulted
in
the
elimination
of
the
give
up
practice
in
1968
at
the
sec
insistence.
these
policies
and
these
procedures
resulted
in
the
elimination
of
fixed
rates
for
under
$2,000.00
and
for
over
$500,000.00
and
then
for
over
$300,000.00
all
of
which
came
at
the
insistence
of
the
sec
through
these
informal
procedures,
19
(b)
letters
if
you
will.
now,
we
heard
yesterday
that
the
commission
should
act
by
order
and
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
apply
if
the
commission
ordered
these
things.
i
suppose
we
could
issue
orders
on
every
single
rule
but
that
isn't
the
way
the
exchange
act
intended
us
to
operate.
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
yes,
we
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
well,
let
me
--
may
i
first
answer
the
first
part
mr.
justice
by
saying,
we
simply
don't
file
these
rule
changes
in
a
drawer
and
forget
them.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
alright,
so
that
when
there
is
this
procedure
by
the
sec,
do
not
disapprove
because
we
believe
that
the
rule
change
is
consistent
with
the
act.
that
we
believe
is
agency
action
and
as
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
no.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
we
say
that
it
ought
to
be
but
we
believe
that
that
is
agency
action
and
is
reviewable
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
circuit
court
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
when
the
agency
took
the
action.
well,
if
you're
following
the
developments
of
exchanges
with
respect
to
rule
changes,
you
would
know
when
they
put
into
effect
the
rule
change.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
well,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
at
that
point
because
if
a
rule
change
comes
in,
and
we
have
a
reason
to
question
it,
we
would
then
notify
the
exchange
and
we
suggest
you
not
adopt
that
rule
or
you
drop
another
rule.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
it
would
be
reviewable
under
district
court,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
we
wouldn't
sue
anyone
but
mr.
bader
would
sue
as
he
has
before
testing
our
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
well,
it
isn't
quite
that
bad,
mr.
justice.
the
last
time
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
yes
i'd
like
to.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
i've
gave
him
the
same
advice
we
gave
him
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
1974,
the
last
time
he
sued.
well,
he
brought
just
such
an
action,
attesting
the
agency's
non-disapproval
of
an
exchange
rule
and
he
brought
a
direct
appeal
on
the
second
circuit
under
section
25
(a)
of
the
exchange
act
which
calls
for
direct
appeal
in
the
circuit
courts
for
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
you're
stuck
with
record.
but
the
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
well,
but
the
point
mr.
justice
is
this
that
in
that
case,
we
suggested
to
the
second
circuit
that
this
was
not
an
order
just
as
the
third
circuit
find
in
the
pbw
case
that
our
rule
was
not
an
order
within
the
meaning
of
section
25
of
the
exchange
act.
we
suggested
to
the
court
that
mr.
bader
had
an
action
in
the
district
court
on
the
basis
of
agency
action
which
he
did
not
pursue.
he
did
not
then
go
to
the
district
court.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
under
that
circumstance,
i
would
say
yes
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
i
believe
it
does
mr.
justice
and
of
course
if
the
record
consisted
of
a
rule
proposal
in
a
non-disapproval,
there
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
record
and
i
think
in
that
case,
there
would
have
to
be
a
record
and
i'm
sure
that
the
department
of
justice
would
be
an
active
participant
in
a
hearing.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
no,
i
would
not
believe
so
in
that
case.
i
just
wanted
to
conclude
that
part
of
my
remarks
by
saying
that
in
the
pbw
case
in
the
third
circuit
1973,
in
an
independent
broker-dealer
case
in
1971
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
those
two
circuits
analyzed
exactly
how
this
regulatory
scheme
works,
talking
about
the
jurisdiction,
how
this
informal
assortment
of
regulatory
tools
are
intended
to
operate
and
both
concluded
that
is
the
way
the
exchange
act
is
intended
to
work
and
the
agency
should
not
be
required
to
resort
to
formal
hearings,
mandates
and
orders
unless
the
exchange
refuses
to
cooperate.
and
that
we
believe
is
what
happened
in
this
case
and
that's
what
we
have
before
us.
i'd
also
like
to
say
that
we
believe
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
replete
with
example
after
example,
of
what
the
sec
has
been
doing
in
this
situation
and
the
department
of
justice's
reply
brief
at
page
6
which
was
filed
on
a
saturday
but
suggests
that
the
sec
has
done
nothing
with
respect
to
the
practice
fixed
commission
rates
until
september
1973
but
merely
tolerated
the
practice
is
we
believe
shockingly
disingenuous.
the
last
point
gets
to
the
issue
of
plain
repugnancy
and
as
i've
indicated,
this
court
had
that
question
before
it
in
silver,
and
analyzed
the
commission's
regulatory
jurisdiction
again
more
thoroughly
in
ware
where
there,
mr.
justice
blackmun
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court
said
that
these
kinds
of
measures
and
rules
by
exchanges
authorized
by
the
commission
are
designed
to
ensure
fair
dealing
and
to
protect
investors
and
are
the
kind
directly
related
to
the
act's
purposes.
and
we
believe
that
we
are
talking
about
it
in
essential
ingredient
in
the
exchange
act
in
this
case
and
in
silver
which
was
a
particular
enforcement
of
an
exchange
rule,
this
court
spent
five
pages
of
its
opinion
reciting
rule
after
rule
after
rule
over
the
exchange
everyone
of
which
was
anti-competitive
and
then
said
that
those
rules
were
designed
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
act
but
that
there
will
be
no
repealer
in
that
case
because
the
sec
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
the
particular
enforcement
of
that
situation.
but
that
a
different
case
would
be
presented
when
this
court
was
faced
with
a
rule
over
which
the
sec
does
have
jurisdiction
and
if
there
was
ever
a
classic
different
case,
we
believe
that
this
is
that
case.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
yes,
they
do
and
we
think
that
they
have
misread
ricci,
mr.
justice.
ricci
involved
a
withdrawal
of
a
membership
on
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
and
this
court's
opinion
said
that
there
were
facts
that
had
to
be
resolved
in
that
dispute,
had
ricci
voluntarily
given
up
his
membership?
did
segal
have
a
lien
of
shares?
did
ricci
owe
segal
brokerage
fees
and
was
the
withdrawal
of
the
membership
or
the
taking
away
of
the
membership
consistent
with
a
valid
rule
of
the
exchange?
said
this
is
something
that
should
be
sent
to
the
commodity
exchange
authority
for
decision
on
the
facts.
and
after
the
facts
are
in,
we
will
decide
if
there
is
an
implied
repealer
because
if
the
membership
was
taken
away
pursuant
to
an
invalid
rule
or
taken
away
improperly,
then
the
implied
repealer
question
goes
away.
the
antitrust
case
should
proceed
but
if
it
was
taken
away
from
him
--
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
then
the
antitrust
court
action
proceeds.
mr.
lawrence
e.
nerheim
and
as
the
chief
justice
indicated
in
that
case,
the
silver
case
was
clearly
not
before
it
in
ricci
and
we
agree.
we
think
this
is
--
we
believe
this
is
a
situation
where
the
district
court
properly
applied
silver.
we
believe
that
the
second
circuit
properly
applied
silver
and
we
respectfully
urged
this
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court.
