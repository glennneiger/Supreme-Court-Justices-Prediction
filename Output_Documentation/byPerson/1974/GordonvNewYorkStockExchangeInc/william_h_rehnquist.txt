justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bader,
what
grant
of
authority
was
congress
legislating
under
to
regulate
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
1934,
wasn't
that
the
commerce
power?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
it's
something
more
than
the
government
just
not
discovering
some
wrongdoing
or
some
of
that
very
sufficiently
small
number
of
exchanges
that
the
sec
presumably
is
cognizant
of
what
they're
doing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
administrative
procedure
act
provides,
doesn't
it
that
if
there
has
been
no
record
made
in
the
agency,
you're
permitted
to
make
one
in
the
district
court?
