mr.
i.
walton
bader
hold
on.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
legality
of
the
fixed
commission
rates
which
have
been
charged
by
brokerage
houses
in
a
security
business
since
the
buttonwood
tree
agreement
in
1792
which
of
course
antedates
the
passage
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
in
the
1890's.
the
minimum
fee
schedules
charged
by
the
securities
industry
brokerage
houses,
thus,
the
longest
sustained
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
that
this
country
has
ever
seen.
in
1792,
the
brokerage
community
got
under
a
buttonwood
tree
and
they
agreed
that
they
would
do
the
following
things.
they
first
would
have
minimum
commission
rates
which
would
be
charged
and
that
no
broker
would
have
the
right
to
charge
to
meet
the
fixed
minimum.
if
the
broker
in
fact
charged
beneath
the
fixed
minimum,
he
would
be
expelled
from
the
exchange
so
that
we
had
at
that
time
a
clear
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
but
of
course
that
wasn't
the
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
at
that
time
because
the
sherman
act
hadn't
been
passed.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
down
in
wall
street,
it
was
a
tree,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
was
i
think
somewhere
around
the
present
area
of
bowling
green,
manhattan
but
i
don't
want
to
be
pinned
down
to
that.
in
1890,
the
sherman
act
was
passed.
that
didn't
affect
the
practice
of
the
brokerage
community
in
charging
fixed
rates
of
commission
and
apparently
the
reason
for
that
was
that
the
requirements
of
interstate
commerce
at
that
time
had
not
been
broaden
by
this
court
and
the
decisions
that
were
passed
during
the
roosevelt
and
new
deal
era.
and
therefore,
that
was
considered
to
be
a
mere
local
problem
which
would
not
fall
within
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
1934,
the
securities
act
was
passed
and
in
1934,
the
pujo
committee
which
was
considering
the
passage
of
the
securities
acts
consider
the
practices
of
the
stock
exchanges
which
had
been
charging
fixed
rates
of
commission
in
accordance
with
the
buttonwood
tree
agreement.
and
the
--
there
was
discussion
at
that
time
that
the
fixed
rates
of
commission
again
because
of
the
restrictive
decisions
of
interstate
commerce
that
had
been
in
effect
at
that
time
would
probably
not
go
and
fall
within
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws.
but
now
in
the
securities
exchange
--
mr.
i.
walton
bader
yes,
that's
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
question
of
fixed
rates
of
commission
there
had
been
a
discussion
in
the
pujo
committee,
that
does
appear
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
where
that
legislative
history
is
set
forth
where
apparently
the
pujo
committee
had
felt
that
the
legislation
with
respect
to
commission
rates
might
possibly
be
beyond
the
commerce
power
of
congress.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
that
far.
i
think
the
legislative
history
amply
determines
as
i
will
point
out
in
my
subsequent
argument
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
fixed
rates
of
commission
are
per
se
illegal
and
that
congress
never
intended
to
give
the
securities
and
exchange
power
--
exchange
commission
regulatory
power
over
commission
rates
which
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment.
now,
the
securities
and
exchange
act
basically
says
that
unless
there
is
a
specific
provision
repealing
any
other
statute
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
the
public
and
the
protection
of
investors
that
this
--
the
securities
and
exchange
act
will
not
repeal
such
prior
statutory
enactment.
however,
the
securities
and
exchange
act
does
have
a
provision
in
it
which
is
section
--
i
believe
its
19
(b)
and
section
19
(b)
(9)
and
that
section
provides
that
under
certain
conditions
which
i
will
allude
to
a
little
bit
more
fully
in
my
subsequent
argument.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
the
right
to
fix
reasonable
rates
of
commission.
now
originally,
the
proposal
that
had
been
put
into
that
section
was
to
fix
uniform
rates
of
commission.
the
word
“uniform”
was
subsequently
taken
out
and
the
word
“reasonable”
was
placed
therein.
now,
it
is
absolutely
clear
and
i
think
that
none
of
the
other
parties
arguing
this
matter
will
deny
that
if
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
had
not
been
passed
and
that
if
the
practice
of
the
stock
exchanges
and
the
brokerage
members
thereof
in
fixing
reasonable
--
in
fixing
minimum
rates
of
commission
were
before
this
court
at
this
time.
there
would
be
no
question
that
there
would
be
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
involved.
we
have
here
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
and
with
a
penalty
that
if
you
fail
to
maintain
the
minimum
rates
of
commission
that
you
become
expelled
from
the
exchange.
however,
the
exchange
is
contend
and
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
also
found
that
because
of
the
supervisory
ability
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
fixing
the
various
matters
in
which
the
exchange
community
does
business.
therefore,
there
is
a
different
method
of
regulation
proposed
for
securities'
transactions
than
there
is
in
the
normal
course
of
commerce
and
that
whereas
i,
in
selling
various
widgets
in
the
marketplace,
must
abide
by
the
antitrust
laws.
i,
as
a
member
of
the
securities
and
exchange
brokerage
community
do
not
because
there
is
another
method
of
regulation
to
protect
the
public
interest
namely
a
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
is
standing
over
the
head
of
the
brokerage
industry
and
ensuring
fair
dealing
to
the
public.
now,
your
honors
are
well
aware
of
course
of
the
large
amount
of
literature
that
has
been
written
about
the
effectiveness
of
regulatory
oversight
over
an
industry
and
that
in
general
regulatory
oversight
of
an
industry
is
considerably
inferior
to
the
regulation
by
the
laws
of
the
marketplace.
what
happens
of
course
is
that
the
regulatory
agency
gets
its
input
primarily
from
the
industry
regulated
whereas
the
public
normally
does
not
have
the
ability
to
put
that
input
into
the
agency.
but
interestedly
enough
the
defendants
in
this
case
argue
for
even
a
more
less
stringent
rule.
they
say,
“we
are
a
self-regulatory
agency.”
the
sec
merely
has
supervisory
authority
over
our
self-regulation
and
not
--
but
despite
that,
despite
the
fact
that
we
are
not
subject
to
regulation
such
as
for
example
the
railroads
are,
or
the
airlines
are,
or
the
other
regulatory
segments
of
the
--
are
mentioned
economy
are.
we're
still
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
in
effect
found
and
that
is
what
the
circuit
court
in
effect
found
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
really
did
nothing
effectively
against
fixed
minimum
commission
rates
until
this
action
was
started.
when
this
action
was
started,
then
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
did
start
considering
the
particular
problem
with
respect
to
minimum
commission
rates.
and
the
first
time
around
when
we
participated
in
a
proceeding
before
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
we
of
course
said
that
that
fixed
minimum
commission
rates
were
bad
in
connection
with
the
public
interest
and
we
present
the
various
arguments
to
the
commission.
the
commission
nevertheless
agreed
to
a
certain
fixed
scale
of
commission
rates
which
the
stock
exchange
had
requested.
we
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
attempting
to
review
that
under
the
securities
act
provision
with
respect
to
review.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
brought
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
was
in
docket
71-1924
which
was
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
then
in
effect
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
said
to
that
court,
“we
have
not
issued
any
order,
we've
not
told
the
exchanges
to
do
anything.
all
we
said
is
that
we
wouldn't
object
to
this
particular
commission
rate
being
in
effect.
and
therefore,
you
have
no
right
of
judicial
review.”
this
is
not
an
order.
and
therefore,
this
does
not
fall
within
the
ambit
of
review
granted
to
you
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934.
so,
we
went
ahead
and
we
went
down
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
we
said,
“well,
maybe
there
are
trying
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
manner
of
the
independent
broker
dealer's
case
maybe
we're
in
the
wrong
court.
maybe
what
we
really
should
do
is
go
after
the
determination
is
not
constituting
an
order
but
constituting
a
determination
which
we
want
to
review.”
we
proceeded
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
sec
promptly
filed
the
brief
to
dismiss
and
in
--
and
as
i
quoted
on
page
6
of
my
brief
the
commission
in
effect
said,
“however,
the
question
of
the
type
and
extent
of
immunity
that
may
flow
from
commission
determinations
regarding
exchange
rules
need
not
to
be
decided
in
this
case.”
the
appropriate
form
for
resolution
of
that
question
is
an
antitrust
action
against
the
self-regulatory
organization
challenging
its
rules
or
the
administration
of
such
rules
indeed
plaintiffs
recognize
that
they
may
seek
the
challenge
exchange
rules
directly.
they
have
instituted
suit
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange
for
this
very
purpose
which
is
this
action
which
is
now
pending
before
this
honorable
court.
the
sec
while
this
action
was
pending
then
made
a
further
study
of
the
commission
rate
structure
and
based
upon
the
further
study,
they
permitted
fixed
commission
rates
to
remain
in
effect
and
accordance
with
the
proposal
that
the
new
york
stock
exchange
had
submitted
and
which
we
opposed
in
another
proceeding
before
the
commission.
and
the
commission
at
that
point
while
determining
that
their
jurisdiction
was
in
effect
and
that
they
would
on
may
1,
1975
mandate
the
end
of
fixed
commission
rates.
they
nevertheless
held
that
prior
to
that
time
essentially
the
proposal
presented
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
for
maintaining
fixed
commission
rates
would
be
permitted
to
stand.
we
again
went
to
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
again,
the
sec
came
in
and
said,
“this
is
no
order,
you
can't
review
it.”
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
without
opinion
again
dismissed
the
petition.
and
again,
we
had
no
judicial
review.
meanwhile,
this
case
was
coming
along,
we
went
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
this
determination.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
came
along
and
said,
“well,
we
feel
that
the
fixed
commission
rates
as
under
the
oversight
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
constitute
the
appropriate
administrative
regulatory
authority
and
therefore,
constitute
the
“different
case”
that
this
court
held
to
be
involved
in
the
silver
case
where
they
held
that
there
was
no
specific
antitrust
immunity
with
respect
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
or
with
respect
to
matters
that
the
self-regulatory
agency
carried
out
but
nevertheless,
there
might
be
an
area
of
immunity
if
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
securities
act
work.
well,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
is
the
different
case
necessary
to
make
the
securities
act
work
and
they
therefore,
held
that
there
was
no
antitrust
liability
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
exchanges.
interestingly
enough,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said,
“we
do
not
say
that
the
petitioner
does
not
have
an
appropriate
form
for
judicial
review.”
how
we
are
supposed
to
get
judicial
review
is
something
i
don't
know.
we've
been
in
six
courts
already
and
we
still
haven't
got
judicial
review.
now,
i
say
this
to
this
court,
first,
the
court
has
held
in
the
silver
case
that
the
self-regulatory
agencies
such
as
the
securities
industry
does
not
have
a
blanket
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
so
that
the
immunity
in
each
case
must
be
considered
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
this
is
not
the
different
case
that
is
necessary
to
make
the
securities
act
work.
the
fixation
of
commission
rates
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
not
necessary
to
make
the
securities
act
work.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
yes,
a
schedule
of
minimum
fees?
mr.
i.
walton
bader
i
don't
think
they
have
--
i
don't
think
they
would
have
a
power
to
do
it.
i
think
that
what
they
would
have
to
do
--
mr.
i.
walton
bader
that's
a
very
interesting
question.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
it's
a
very
interesting
question.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
well,
that's
precisely
it.
that
is
precisely
what
i
do
say
and
i
say
that
the
act
furthermore
does
not
provide
for
the
fixation
of
rates
of
commission.
it
says,
“to
fix
reasonable
rates
of
commission.”
now,
this
is
the
reason
why
it
was
done
in
my
opinion
but
of
course
i'm
not
a
--
i
was
not
in
congress
at
the
time
and
i
don't
have
the
wisdom
to
know
that
congress
really
intended.
but
when
congress
took
the
word
“uniform”
out
and
put
the
word
“reasonable”
in
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
logical
to
consider
that
what
congress
really
wanted
to
do
was
this,
they
wanted
the
market
place
to
fix
commission
rates.
however,
if
the
market
place
for
one
reason
or
another
didn't
do
it
properly
so
that
the
rates
were
excessive
then
i
think
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
could
come
in
and
fix
the
rates.
and
the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
fixation
of
rates
here
is
not
the
usual
fixation
of
rates
that
is
provided
for
in
the
normal
regulatory
statute.
and
the
normal
regulatory
statute,
the
regulatory
agency
holds
hearings
to
determine
what
a
reasonable
rate
is
to
be
such
as
the
federal
power
act
and
the
utility
involved
attempting
to
justify
a
rate
comes
in
with
their
cost
data,
comes
in
with
their
fixed
rates,
their
fixed
expenses,
the
public
who
opposed
the
rate
increase
come
in
and
attempt
to
argue
against
this
and
the
agency
then
makes
the
determination.
this
isn't
the
way
this
is
done.
in
this
case,
the
commission
has
to
first
ask
the
exchange
to
supplement
its
rules.
then,
if
the
exchange
doesn't
do
it,
then
the
commission
can
go
ahead
and
order
a
hearing
and
after
that
hearing
can
direct
the
exchange
to
do
it
with
the
exchange
then
having
the
right
of
normal
appeal
review.
i
think
that
in
my
opinion
for
whatever
its
worth
and
it's
probably
not
worth
very
much
that
the
determination
here
was
only
with
respect
to
excessive
rates
of
commission
and
that
the
minimum
rates
of
commission
that
were
involved
here
at
this
point
are
of
course
not
excessive
rates
of
commission.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
yes,
sir.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
i
believe
he
took
the
position
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
commission
did
have
the
right
to
determine
to
fixed
commission
rates
in
view
of
the
none
interstate
aspect
of
the
stock
brokerage
commission
field
and
view
of
law
and
development
of
law
at
that
time
sir.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
not
that
i
know,
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
have
attempted
to
find
that
my
learned
colleague
from
the
sec
is
attempted
to
find
that,
my
learned
colleague
from
department
of
justice
attempted
to
find
that.
i
think
we've
had
one
of
the
most
thorough
expositions
of
the
law
that
anybody
could
hope
for
and
that's
all
we've
been
able
to
come
up
with.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
and
the
subsequent
change.
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
the
legislative
history
is
really
necessary
in
this
particular
case
to
make
the
determination.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
you
have
a
clear
per
se
violation
involved
plus
the
determination
of
this
court
in
otter
tail
plus
the
silver
case
would
seem
to
indicate
to
me
that
we
may
not
have
to
go
that
far.
but
all
i
can
tell
your
honor
is
that
that's
all
that
i've
been
able
to
find.
now,
the
only
thing
that
i
have
further
to
say,
i'm
just
about
run
out
of
my
time
was
that
the
court
did
have
a
very
similar
case
and
of
course
otter
tail
power
company
against
the
united
states
and
there
it
is
perfectly
well
within
the
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme
to
have
regulatory
agency
oversight
over
a
group
of
individuals
or
a
trade
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
the
trade
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
well,
that
--
there
is
the
commission
of
course
does
have
power
to
proceed
against
violations
of
the
act
and
has
proceeded
against
violations
of
the
act
in
number
of
cases.
and
at
the
same
time
individuals
have
the
right
to
proceed
against
violations
of
the
act.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
i
would
think
the
commission
probably
could
under
those
circumstances.
i
--
i
wonder
whether
or
not
in
view
of
the
statutory
provisions
involved
that
if
the
commission
did
do
something
of
that
kind
whether
the
commission
itself
might
not
be
subject
to
attack
for
exceeding
its
authority.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
i
thank
this
court
for
its
consideration.
mr.
i.
walton
bader
may
it
please,
your
honor.
may
i
first
point
out
to
the
court
that
based
upon
everything
that
has
been
said
here,
it
is
my
feeling
and
belief
that
in
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
before
this
court
is
completely
inadequate
to
make
a
proper
determination
and
i
think
that
really
what
should
be
done
in
this
case
is
to
send
this
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
full
and
complete
trial.
they
could
erase
the
question
of
the
antitrust
immunity
involved,
the
position
of
the
stock
exchange,
the
position
of
the
sec
are
completely
different.
interestingly
enough,
mr.
nerheim
now
tells
me
that
if
i
started
a
district
court
action
against
the
sec
in
connection
with
the
stock
exchange
rules
that
that
district
court
action
would
not
have
been
subject
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
but
we
did
start
such
an
action
and
with
civil
action
1984-71
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
as
pointed
out
on
page
6
of
my
brief,
the
sec
did
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
that
motion
was
granted.
now,
perhaps
the
sec
has
taken
a
different
view
at
this
point
but
i
don't
think
that
a
plaintiff
in
this
should
have
to
come
all
the
way
up
to
the
supreme
court
to
obtain
a
change
in
the
rule.
the
fact
remains
that
the
procedures
that
the
sec
has
for
the
review
of
their
so-called
non-objection
to
stock
exchange
rules
are
now,
are
basically
not
reviewable
by
any
court
and
if
you
try
the
circuit
court,
you're
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
it's
not
an
order.
if
you
tried
at
district
court,
you're
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
there
are
other
considerations
involved
which
make
that
inappropriate.
and
i
submit
that
without
a
consistent
means
for
the
public
to
proceed
in
any
of
these
agency
determinations
that
as
a
practical
matter,
such
an
agency
determination
could
not
repeal
the
antitrust
laws
and
as
matter
of
fact,
there
might
be
some
serious
due
process
violations
involved
as
well.
now,
basically,
as
far
as
this
court
has
determined
under
the
silver
case,
it
seems
that
the
exemption
in
each
case
has
to
be
considered
under
the
facts
that
are
involved
in
the
particular
case
and
under
the
facts
that
are
involved
in
this
particular
case,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
the
record
is
considered
by
the
court
to
be
complete
that
there
is
no
such
implied
exemption
of
the
antitrust
laws.
i
point
out
for
example
that
let
us
assume
that
the
stock
exchange
provided
for
a
rule
which
similar
to
it,
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
mentioned,
that
let
us
say
the
rule
provided
for
a
division
of
markets
and
we'll
assume
that
the
sec
does
not
object
to
that
rule
for
one
reason
or
another.
is
the
position
of
the
defendant
now
in
this
case
that
such
a
clear
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
would
now
be
insulated?
or
let
us
go
to
something
else.
let
us
suppose
that
the
sec
has
a
rule
now
abolishing
fixed
commission
rates
as
they
do.
two
exchange
members
get
together
now
and
go
ahead
and
determine
that
they
are
going
to
fixed
commission
rates
regardless.
mr.
nerheim
has
said
and
mr.
jackson
has
said
quite
correctly
that
that
would
not
be
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
however,
since
this
is
now
a
violation
of
the
sec
act,
we
are
now
met
with
a
situation
where
there
are
a
number
of
cases
holding
that
if
you
sue
under
antitrust
counts
for
a
violation
of
the
anti
--
of
the
sec
act,
that
at
that
point,
you're
only
entitled
to
single
damages
and
not
triple
damages.
so
that
what
i'm
pointing
out
to
the
court
is
that
you're
ending
up
into
a
plethora
of
problems.
the
proper
regulatory
scheme
as
the
plaintiff
submits
and
i
so
believe
justice
submits
is
that
any
particular
regulatory
scheme
which
is
tended
to
be
a
claim
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
must
be
considered
in
each
individual
case.
now,
what
actually
happens
that
in
so
far
as
fixed
commission
rights,
there
has
been
no
significant
agency
action
taken
in
this
case
except
now
after
some
41
years.
now,
furthermore,
the
sec
grants
any
of
their
requests
that
it
may
--
of
files
a
rule
19
(b)
request,
there
is
no
public
participation
in
such
request.
now,
to
say
that
that
can
now
be
reviewed
by
a
member
of
the
public
now
coming
in
and
bringing
a
suit
in
the
district
court
and
getting
into
a
full
dress
trial
would
belie
the
entire
administrative
process.
this
means
now
that
there
is
no
way
to
come
before
the
sec
first
and
say
to
the
sec
gentlemen,
this
rule
that
is
being
proposed
has
serious
anti-competitive
effects.
the
normal
rule
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
it
would
seem
to
me,
would
be
completely
violated
by
permitting
such
a
procedure
and
since
there
is
no
mechanism
for
public
participation
in
connection
with
such
a
rule,
it
seems
to
me
that
such
a
statutory
scheme
cannot
be
held
to
be
regulatory
authority
and
violated
and
not
immune
from
the
antitrust
laws.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
precisely
what
ought
to
tell
held.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
almost
directly
analogous
to
ought
to
tell.
also,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
has
been
never
any
sec
order
of
any
kind
ordering
any
fixed
commission
rates.
the
only
sec
order
that
has
been
imposed,
has
been
made
has
been
the
order
now
that
fixed
commission
rates
shall
be
phased
out.
now,
let
us
suppose
that
the
sec
now
determines
after
let
us
say
the
1st
of
june
and
the
1st
of
july,
that
fixed
unblocked
rates
have
not
worked
out
and
the
stock
exchange
now
presents
a
proposal
for
fixed
rates,
the
sec
now
goes
ahead
and
permits
that
fixed
rate
order
to
go
in
without
any
review,
without
any
hearing,
without
anything
of
that
sort
going
on.
now,
i
as
a
member
of
the
public
do
not
have
any
right
to
make
my
views
know
to
the
sec.
i
must
now
go
ahead
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
bring
an
action
with
respect
to
this
and
i
have
the
entire
burden
on
myself
of
a
full-dress
trial
with
the
sec
no
longer
in
a
position
where
i
am
attempting
to
convince
a
regulatory
agency
to
take
certain
action
but
as
an
adversary
to
the
regulatory
agency
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
the
proper
regulatory
practice.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
consideration.
