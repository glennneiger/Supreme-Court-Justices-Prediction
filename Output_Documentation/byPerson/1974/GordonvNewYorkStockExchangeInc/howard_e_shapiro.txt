mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
subsequent
to
the
grant
of
the
writ
in
this
case,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
on
january
23rd
this
year
adopted
securities
and
exchange
act
rule
19
(b)
(3).
this
rule
prospectively
abolishes
fixed
commission
rates
to
the
public
effective
may
1,
1975
and
as
to
members
or
associated
members
of
the
exchanges
in
what's
called
“floor
brokerage”
as
of
may
1
the
next
year.
the
decision
appears
in
the
securities
exchange
commission
documentary
appendix
at
page
109
and
i
will
refer
to
it
from
time
to
time
in
my
argument.
it
concisely
reviews
the
history
of
exchange
price
fixing
before
and
after
the
securities
act
of
1934
and
sets
forth
very
effectively
the
reasons
why
the
problem
had
not
been
given
attention
until
the
last
decade.
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
is
that
when
congress
enacted
section
19
(b),
it
created
no
blanket
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
instead,
the
question
of
exemption
should
be
resolve
by
the
method
defined
in
silver
against
new
york
stock
exchange.
respondent's
contention
that
this
method
is
inapplicable
really
amounts
to
a
reassertion
of
the
same
claim
of
blanket
immunity
which
they
advanced
in
the
silver
case
and
which
the
court
rejected
in
silver
as
to
the
application
of
the
method.
now,
under
the
silver
test
as
applied
to
section
19
(b)
including
section
19
(b)
expressed
reference
to
the
fixing
of
rates
of
commission.
the
usual
antitrust
standards
are
changed.
silver
indicates
that
there
must
be
a
particularize
inquiry
to
determine
whether
exchange
rules
within
19
(b)
are
necessary
but
no
more
restrictive
than
necessary
to
make
the
securities
exchange
act
work.
thus,
exemption
is
implied
only
when
in
a
reconcilable
conflict
is
found
as
to
particular
instances
of
exchange
self-regulation.
now,
this
accommodation
of
the
antitrust
in
regulatory
requirements
serves
to
reconcile
the
statutory
schemes
rather
than
to
hold
one
or
the
other
ousted.
it
rests
on
the
court's
recognition
that
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
exchange
act
are
complimentary
not
antithetical.
now,
its
application
here
we
think
is
confirmed
by
ricci
against
chicago
mercantile
exchange
and
merrill
lynch
against
ware.
the
question
of
whether
when
this
method
of
silver
is
applied
in
this
case
an
exemption
actually
arises
cannot
be
answered
on
this
record.
the
courts
below
did
not
attempt
to
make
the
silver
type
inquiry.
they
found
a
blanket
exemption.
now,
silver
did
three
things
as
i
have
said
first,
it
defined
a
method
for
reconciling
antitrust
laws
and
the
duty
of
collective
self-regulation
which
the
exchange
act
requires.
second,
in
silver,
the
court
applied
the
method
to
the
case
before
it
and
made
the
determination
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case
as
to
exemption.
thus,
whether
there
is
exemption
or
non-exemption
is
really
a
product
of
the
application
of
the
silver
method.
now,
the
third
thing
the
court
did
in
silver
was
to
state
that
a
different
case
as
to
exemption
would
arise
where
the
act
provided
sec
jurisdiction
and
ensuing
judicial
review
of
particular
exchange
rulings.
so,
what
was
reserved
in
silver
was
not
the
method
for
reconciling
the
two
statutes.
that
is
the
requirement
for
a
particularize
the
inquiry.
the
court
reserved
decision
on
the
effect
of
sec
jurisdiction
on
cases
where
the
sec
has
jurisdiction
and
where
there
is
ensuing
judicial
review.
when
the
silver
test
is
applied
to
particular
instances
of
exchange
self-regulation,
now,
the
court
in
silver
was
fully
aware
of
section
19
(b)
and
its
relation
to
the
rules
of
the
exchange
because
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
jurisdiction
overruled
in
the
rules
fixing
commission
rates
as
listed
in
section
19
(b).
the
court
in
footnote
16
of
the
silver
decision
at
page
364
assumed
that
under
section
19
(b)
the
sec
could
adopt
the
rule
imposing
that
very
notice
in
hearing
of
requirements
whose
absence
from
the
exchange
rules
involved
in
that
case
had
led
the
court
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
justification
to
support
the
exemption
under
the
1934
act.
since
the
record
in
that
case
fully
explored
the
question
of
necessity
and
there
was
no
possible
basis
in
which
the
sec
could
find
that
notice
and
hearing
were
not
required
by
the
1934
act.
the
court
itself
resolved
the
exemption
question
despite
the
sec's
reserved
jurisdiction
over
exchange
rules.
now,
because
section
19
(b)
expressly
refers
to
the
fixing
of
commission
rates,
we
have
to
consider
the
effect
of
that
language.
section
19
(b)
does
not
authorize
the
exchanges
to
do
anything.
it
confers
a
reserved
or
secondary
jurisdiction
on
the
sec
over
any
rules
the
exchanges
may
adopt
in
carrying
out
their
duty
of
self-regulation
which
fall
within
the
enumeration
of
particular
matters
contained
in
section
19
(b).
in
our
view,
it
adds
to
the
panoply
of
remedies
available
under
existing
law.
section
28
of
the
exchange
act
expressly
declares
that
the
rights
and
remedies
that
defined
by
the
exchange
act
are
in
addition
to
all
others
that
may
exist
at
law
or
equity.
with
respect
to
section
19
(b)'s
reference
to
fixed
commissions,
we
agree
subject
to
qualifications
then
i
will
state
with
the
sec's
brief
at
page
11
where
it
says
congress
recognized
the
existence
of
fixed
commissions
but
shows
neither
to
outlaw
that
practice
nor
to
endorse
it
but
rather
to
bring
it
under
the
complete
control
of
the
commission.
i
--
i
express
three
qualifications
to
that.
first,
congress
gave
the
commission
complete
but
not
exclusive
power
within
the
purposes
of
the
exchange
act.
second,
congress
recognized
price
fixing
as
it
has
existed
since
1792
but
did
not
endorse
it.
and
third,
congress
neither
condemned
nor
endorsed
whether
that
recognize
so
that
the
fixing
of
commission
rates
is
thus
permitted
as
a
matter
of
securities
law
until
the
sec
acts
on
the
practice
as
it
now
has.
but,
even
though
it's
permitted
under
the
securities
act
that's
not
enough,
it's
fundamental
that
even
though
a
practice
maybe
permitted
under
a
regulatory
statute.
that
does
not
exempt
it
from
the
antitrust
laws
thus,
with
the
power
commission's
approval
the
acquisition
of
a
northwest
pipeline
company
by
el
paso
natural
gas
was
permitted
by
the
natural
gas
act
but
it
was
still
subject
to
antitrust
scrutiny
as
in
california
against
the
fpc.
and
the
banks
that
merged
in
philadelphia
with
the
approval
of
the
comptroller
of
currency
were
permitted
to
do
so
under
the
old
bank
merger
act
but
they
still
had
the
postmaster
under
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
the
amici
and
the
respondents
have
viewed
--
have
reviewed
the
legislative
history
of
the
1934
act
at
some
length.
what
it
boils
down
to
is
this,
congress
knew
about
commission
rate
fixing
like
exchanges
but
it
never
specifically
considered
the
practice
in
relation
to
the
antitrust
laws.
i
think
the
history
is
well
summarized
in
the
commission's
decision
abolishing
fixed
commission
rates
where
at
pages
116
and
117
of
the
sec's
documentary
appendix.
the
commission
says
that
congress
was
focused
primarily
upon
such
obvious
evils
as
corners,
pools
manipulations
insider
trading
and
other
fraudulent
and
deceptive
practices
which
seriously
injured
investors.
with
respect
to
commission
rates,
there
were
some
concern
that
the
possible
overcharging
with
the
possible
overcharging
of
unsophisticated
investors
and
with
possible
monopoly
profits
and
the
commission
was
therefore
giving
regulatory
authority.
as
the
sec's
report
on
19
(b)
(3)
also
shows
congress
didn't
substitute
pervasive
public
utility
type
regulation
for
competition.
it
just
doesn't
fit
this
industry.
thus,
the
assumption
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
ousted
because
the
regulatory
scheme
leaves
no
room
for
them
even
when
a
reference
to
rate
fixing
cannot
be
sustained
here.
what
congress
adopted
was
a
system
of
private
initiative
and
self-regulation
subject
to
a
reserved
commission
oversight.
now,
where
there
is
a
system
and
which
an
industry
is
given
collective
power
to
control
its
own
affairs
through
voluntary
commercial
relationships
governed
in
the
first
instance
by
private
business
judgment
then
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
overridden
absence
some
expression
by
congress.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
or
by
the
commission
and
that
opens
another
aspect
of
it.
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
sec's
jurisdiction
is
complete,
i
think
that
the
commission
could
in
appropriate
case
make
a
determination
that
fixed
commissions
are
required
and
at
least
as
far
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
concerned
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter
since
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
i
do.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
exchange
would
be
under
an
enforceable
--
under
a
duty
which
is
enforceable
against
them
to
obey
the
sec's
order.
now,
the
sec's
report
on
section
19
(b)
(3)
also
reflects
that
until
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
it
is
a
shared
power
as
we
view
it.
and
the
answer
relies
in
the
fact
as
occurs
elsewhere
in
the
law
that
there
maybe
overlapping
jurisdictions
where
the
regulatory
agency
had
some
powers
to
compel
conduct
not
authorized
--
not
otherwise
authorized
by
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
i
think
you're
--
you
understood
me
correctly
your
honor.
the
question
is
--
it
turns
on
whether
they
actually
require
the
particular
conduct
involuntary.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
enforceable
way
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
no,
if
they
--
the
scheme
of
section
19
(b)
is
a
little
peculiar
because
it
does
call
first
for
a
request
from
the
commission
to
the
exchange
and
if
the
exchange
complies
with
just
the
request,
it's
doing
so
very
voluntary,
it's
not
compelled
to
do
so.
we
would
say
in
that
situation
the
necessary
to
make
the
act
work
would
apply,
silver
case
would
apply.
i
can
envision
a
range
of
activities
if
the
sec
requests
fixed
commission
rates
and
the
exchange
is
complied
without
a
formal
19
(b)
proceeding
the
silver
test
applies.
if
the
sec
accompanies
its
request
with
the
public
--
with
the
reason
determination
of
necessity
which
you
used
and
doesn't
and
it
simply
request
to
the
change
to
be
made.
this
has
to
be
given
appropriate
weight
by
the
antitrust
court.
now,
if
the
sec
disapproves
or
terminates
the
rule
well
then
of
course
there's
no
defense
under
the
silver
test
at
all
and
nothing
left.
if
the
sec
orders
price
fixing
after
a
19
(b)
proceeding,
the
silver
test
doesn't
apply.
if
the
exchange
--
i
mean
if
the
sec
simply
acquiesces
or
tolerates
or
takes
no
action
in
what
the
exchanges
have
been
doing
over
the
years
then
the
silver
test
applies.
there's
no
immunity
from
that.
and
finally,
i
suppose
one
can
say
that
if
the
sec
determines
as
it
argues
it
has
here
that
rates
should
be
faced
out
in
step
by
step.
this
determination
of
a
need
for
transition
period
has
to
be
waited
with
the
rest
of
the
silver
test.
now,
one
of
the
questions
that
comes
up
in
--
never
we
discussed
this
is
why
has
everyone
waited
until
now
to
start
talking
about
the
validity
of
fixed
commission
rates
after
all
these
years
since
1792.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
where
the
immunity
is
clear,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
the
silver
test
applies.
with
various
amounts
of
weight
being
given
to
what
the
sec
has
done
in
relation
to
the
exchanged
rules.
i
was
about
to
mention
the
long
period
which
had
gone
by
without
anyone
challenging
these
rules.
now,
the
sec
report
on
section
19
(b)
(3)
at
page
136
i
think
succinctly
sum
that
up
also.
it
reflects
that
until
the
special
study
of
security's
markets
was
published
in
1963
everyone
just
sort
of
assumed
that
fixed
commission
rates
were
normal
and
the
necessary
feature
of
the
exchange
markets.
nobody
the
antitrust
division,
the
private
bar,
the
sec
itself
had
questioned
the
assumption
either
as
a
matter
of
economic
policy
or
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
even
under
the
securities
exchange
act
as
the
report
points
out
at
page
118.
now,
the
special
study
itself
did
not
address
this
particular
problem
of
fixed
commission
rates.
but
it
found
that
the
practice
of
fixed
commission
rates
was
leading
to
--
attempts
to
evade
them
on
such
a
massive
scale
particularly
by
institutional
investors
that
the
system
was
not
only
not
working.
it
--
it
was
harming
the
industry
and
this
over
the
years
slowly
led
the
sec
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
need
to
abolish
them
and
it's
finally
come
to
that
conclusion
this
year.
there's
a
further
argument
made
about
applying
the
silver
test
in
the
context
of
this
case.
that
is
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
it's
going
to
have
severe
adverse
effects
on
the
industry.
that
the
administration
of
the
act
will
be
paralyzed
because
exchanges
will
be
afraid
to
carry
out
their
duty
of
self-regulation.
silver
has
led
to
no
such
paralysis
nor
have
there
been
any
kind
of
flood
of
antitrust
cases
challenging
every
aspect
of
commission
rulemaking.
the
handful
of
cases
have
concerned
the
consequences
of
price
fixing
and
most
to
the
antitrust
problems
will
disappear
with
its
abolition.
the
possibility
that
exchange
rules
may
be
tested
under
silver
and
a
sherman
act
suit
will
have
a
sagittary
effect
upon
the
exchanges
exercise
of
their
duty
of
self-regulation.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that's
right.
if
the
act
--
if
the
court
construes
the
act
is
conferring
a
blanket
immunity
and
that
you
never
worry
about
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
this
area,
that's
under
19
(b).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
contention
and
our
answer
to
that
is
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
answer
silver
and
ricci
and
also
merrill
lynch
against
ware
because
just
using
that
word
“preemption”
for
a
moment
in
a
state
preemption
case.
the
silver
analysis
was
applied.
now,
the
point
that
i'm
really
making
is
that
under
those
cases
the
determination
of
preemption
if
we
want
to
use
that
or
exemption
or
immunity
is
not
made
in
the
abstract
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
it
is
applied
to
particularize
instances
of
exchange
action
and
it
takes
a
record
to
do
that
which
doesn't
exist
here.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
new
order?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
abolishing
fixed
commission
rates.
well,
once
that
becomes
effective,
there
will
be
no
defense
under
silver
for
any
price
fixing
thereafter.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
if
it
does,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
that's
right.
our
contention
of
course
goes
to
the
claim
that
there
is
no
blanket
immunity
but
a
more
particularized
immunity.
i
was
discussing
the
policy
question
which
is
argued
of
course
when
we
talk
about
policy
here,
you
must
recognize
the
policy
has
to
be
assessed
under
existing
law.
it's
the
antitrust
laws
as
they
stand
in
the
securities
act
as
it
stands
without
any
express
immunity
and
of
course
the
principle
it
repeals
to
the
antitrust
laws
by
implication
from
a
regulatory
scheme
are
strongly
disfavored.
there
are
policy
arguments
that
the
sec
should
have
absolute
authority
in
this
area
that
the
exchange
should
be
completely
immune.
but
this
is
not
the
form
and
which
that
kind
of
a
broad
contention
can
be
made.
if
it
is
to
be
considered,
i'd
point
out
that
there
are
some
important
arguments
the
other
way.
the
possibility
that
exchange
rules
will
be
tested
in
the
sherman
act
suit
will
have
sagittary
effect
upon
the
exchanges
exercise
of
their
duty
in
self-regulation.
there
will
be
stimulated
to
scrutinize
closely
any
rules
involving
seriously
in
a
competitive
consequences.
to
be
certain
that
they're
actually
necessary
to
make
the
exchange
act
work,
the
sec
will
benefit
because
the
heightened
attention
to
the
acts
requirement
by
the
exchanges
under
the
stimulus
of
the
silver
test
with
its
attendant
minimization
of
practices
that
do
not
benefit
investors
will
reduce
the
need
for
regulatory
intervention
by
the
sec
itself
far
from
having
a
chilling
effect.
therefore,
we
think
that
continued
application
of
the
sherman
act
will
serve
to
compliment
for
a
self-regulation
under
the
sec's
reserved
jurisdiction.
