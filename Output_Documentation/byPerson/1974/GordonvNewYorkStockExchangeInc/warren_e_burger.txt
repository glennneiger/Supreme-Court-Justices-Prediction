i

that
impression
from

i
got
the

to
mr.

misunderstand
you
then?

and
in
enforceable
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
do
it
and
actually
carried
out
in
good
faith
then

you

16
minutes
remaining

chief
justice
warren
e.

really,
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
individual
members
of
the
exchange
violates
some
federal
law,
they
are
subject
to
the
same
penalties
as
any
other
cities
that
violates
the
federal
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing
that
this
is
a
sort
of
de
facto
approval
when
they
failed
to
disapprove
after
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
not
some
statutes
relating
to
regulatory
agencies
which
provide
a
mechanism
that
--
like
the
filing
of
a
tariff
which
had
not
disapproved
goes
into
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
areas
other
than
tariffs?
