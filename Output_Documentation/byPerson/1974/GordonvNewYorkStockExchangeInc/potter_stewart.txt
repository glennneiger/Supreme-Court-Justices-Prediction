where
was
the
buttonwood
tree
down
in
the

justice

do
i
remember
correctly
from
being
in
the
briefs
that
the
change
from
the
word
“uniform”
to
the
word
“reasonable”
was
made
after
some
testimony
by
mr.
samuel
on
or
by
before
the
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
he
took
the
position
that
what,
do
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
a
--
beyond
that
is
a
--
is
there
any
legislative
history
that
you
know
of
explaining
the
word
“change”
from
“uniform”
to
“reasonable”?
justice
potter
stewart
this
testimony
and
then
the
subsequent
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
transpire
with
each
other.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
in
that
instance,
that's
my
view
your
honor.
justice
potter
stewart
your
submission
is
that
the
commission's
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
over
the
exchange
as
such.
justice
potter
stewart
what
happens
if
two
or
more
members
of
the
exchange
agreed
together
to
have
a
raise?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
today
if
members
--
couple
of
members
of
the
exchange
agreed
to
divide
their
markets
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
clearly
amenable
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
your
suit.
justice
potter
stewart
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
of
the
rostrum
take
a
good
deal
of
comfort
from
the
ricci
case
saying
that
that
answered
the
question
left
unanswered
in
silver.
what
do
you
have
to
say
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
stay
away
contrary
to
a
valid
rule,
say.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
