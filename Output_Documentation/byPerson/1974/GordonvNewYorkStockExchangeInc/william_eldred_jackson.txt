mr.
william
eldred
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
think
i'm
not
going
too
far
when
i
say
that
the
position
taken
by
the
department
of
justice
in
this
case
is
nothing
less
than
an
effort
to
exalt
the
antitrust
laws
to
a
quasi
constitutional
status.
a
status
in
which
this
particular
statute
is
a
far
greater
force
than
another
later
statute
passed
by
congress
with
which
the
antitrust
laws
are
inconsistent.
i
think
this
is
the
most
extreme
position
the
department
has
taken
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
implied
repeal
that
i
know
of
because
inherent
in
its
position
that
there
is
no
exemption
here
is
that
the
following
circumstances
are
of
no
moment
whatsoever.
first,
that
the
exchanges
are
authorized
and
permitted
by
the
exchange
act
to
adopt
rules
fixing
commissions.
secondly,
that
congress
created
the
sec
to
act
as
the
guardian
of
the
public
interest
in
supervising
and
changing
if
necessary
rules
relating
to
commissions.
under
regulatory
standards
that
are
broader
than
those
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
thirdly,
despite
the
references
to
tame
regulators
as
this
record
shows
that
the
sec
has
actively
exercised
these
powers
and
has
been
an
active
watchdog.
indeed,
major
changes
seven
of
them
in
commission
rules
of
exchanges
have
taken
place
in
the
past
seven
years.
all
of
them
at
the
request
or
with
the
approval
of
the
sec
and
after
hearings
in
which
the
department
of
justice
participated,
all
these
counts
for
not
in
the
department's
world
of
antitrust
absolutism.
there
can
be
no
antitrust
exemption
here
despite
a
perfectly
apparent
head-on
collision
between
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
exchange
act.
and
this
means
that
in
any
case
and
in
every
case
where
a
rule
of
an
exchange
is
challenged
under
the
antitrust
laws
if
this
theory
would
apply
there
would
have
to
be
a
trial
de
novo
of
the
facts
even
after
review
and
approval
and
even
after
modification
of
the
rule
in
question
by
the
sec
and
this
would
be
a
trial
under
the
standards
not
of
the
exchange
act
but
of
the
antitrust
laws.
this
is
to
ignore
the
exchange
act.
this
is
to
second
guess
the
sec.
this
is
to
say
that
exchanges
should
be
regulated
by
district
courts
with
the
aid
of
the
department
of
justice
and
with
the
assistance
of
juries
rather
than
by
the
expert
agency
to
which
congress
has
created
the
task.
with
the
greatest
of
respect
i
submit
that
this
is
(inaudible)
run
wild
and
that
it
was
properly
rejected
by
the
lower
courts.
i
would
submit
your
honors
that
the
question
before
the
court
is
that
which
was
left
open
in
silver.
the
different
case
with
respect
to
antitrust
exemption
where
the
sec
has
jurisdiction
over
the
practice
attacked.
we
submit
of
course
that
this
is
the
case,
the
different
case
and
that
its
resolution
has
been
foreshadowed
in
silver
itself.
there's
no
issue
here
of
blanket
immunity
for
exchanges
or
for
all
exchange
activities
as
this
court
recognize
in
the
hugh's
case
a
regulatory
scheme
may
not
be
sufficiently
pervasive
to
result
in
a
total
exemption
but
nevertheless,
it
may
result
in
exemption
in
particular
and
discrete
instances.
that's
all
we're
dealing
with
here
because
the
issue
here
of
antitrust
exemption
relates
only
to
a
single
aspect
of
exchange
activities.
the
fixing
of
reasonable
rates
of
commission
to
be
charge
by
members
as
permitted
by
section
19
(b)
(9)
of
the
exchange
act
subject
to
sec
review
jurisdiction.
now,
the
buttonwood
tree
has
been
referred
to
and
it
is
not
without
significance
i
submit
that
commission
rate
fixing
by
exchanges
has
been
engaged
in
this
country
openly
and
above
board
since
the
buttonwood
tree
agreement
in
1792.
we
all
know
that
horizontal
price
fixing
and
rate
fixing
by
competitors
has
been
unlawful
at
least
since
the
passage
of
the
sherman
act
and
yet
the
exchange
commission
rate
fixing
was
not
challenged
by
the
department
of
justice
at
all
prior
to
the
exchange
act
of
1934
despite
this
court's
ruling
in
trenton
potteries
that
price
fixing
was
per
se
unlawful.
and
then
congress
in
1934
in
enacting
the
exchange
act
an
act
which
we
all
recognize
was
designed
to
correct
abuses
nevertheless
permitted
the
exchanges
to
continue
their
historic
and
well
known
practice
of
fixing
rates
of
commission.
subject
however,
for
the
first
time
to
regulation
of
that
practice
by
a
government
agency
and
in
giving
the
sec
jurisdiction
to
review
those
rates,
the
standards
established
by
the
act
with
those
of
reasonableness
and
other
standards
listed
in
the
act,
the
primary
one
of
which
was
a
protection
of
investors.
so
that
after
the
passage
of
the
exchange
act
the
exchanges
were
no
longer
engaging
in
unfettered
rate
fixing
by
custom.
but
they
are
engaging
in
statutory
permitted
and
government's
supervised
rate
fixing
which
even
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
thill
case
with
which
we
thoroughly
disagree
described
as
a
system
of
authorized
price
fixing.
and
so
the
question
is
whether
congress
by
providing
for
sec
supervised
commission
fixing
in
section
19
(b)
(9)
of
the
exchange
act
intended
by
necessary
implication
to
exclude
such
commission
fixing
from
the
scope
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
it
is
your
honor.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
exactly.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
exactly,
it's
still
a
conflict
of
regulatory
schemes
a
conflict
of
jurisdictions
the
existence
of
the
power
is
sufficient.
on
that
point,
we
think
the
thill
court
went
off
the
track.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
we
--
you
say
that
that
commission
fixing
is
authorized
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
no,
sir
but
we
say
the
commission
fixing
by
the
exchange
being
passively
permitted
by
the
sec
is
not
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
of
the
fixed
commission
rule?
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
that's
right.
that's
right
and
has
done
so.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
it
is.
they
would
be
violating
the
exchange
rule.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
or
might
be
engaging
in
other
practices
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade
under
the
exchange
act.
we
submit
your
honors
that
a
pro
tanto
implied
repeal
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
this
case
is
compelled
by
two
separate
considerations
and
the
first
is
the
doctrine
of
repugnancy
which
applies
where
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
would
collide
with
the
regulatory
scheme
of
a
later
statute.
we
submit
that
the
sherman
act
prohibition
against
horizontal
rate
fixing
simply
cannot
be
reconciled
where
the
exchange
act
provisions
permitting
commission
fixing
because
the
exchange
act
authorizes
under
government
edges
the
very
conduct
which
is
prohibited
by
the
earlier
statute.
the
two
statutes
we
think
cannot
be
harmonize.
one
says,
“thou
shalt
not.”
the
other
says,
“thou
may.”
and
one
must
yield
to
the
other.
and
under
the
cases
of
this
court,
we
think
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
earlier
statute
must
give
way
to
the
later
one
as
the
expression
of
congress'
intent
on
this
particular
matter.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
that's
what
it
is
done?
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
and
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
still
have
no
effect.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
for
two
reasons,
one
is
the
existence
of
commission
authority
then
the
other
is
the
rule
which
they
have
adopted
which
we
think
has
the
effect
of
an
order.
its
mere
semantics
to
talk
about
a
formal
order
where
they
have
the
power
to
order
you
to
do
something
and
you
comply
with
their
request
without
forcing
them
to
go
through
an
order
proceeding.
the
result
should
be
the
same.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
that's
right
and
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
it
is
--
it
will
be
an
exchange
rule
adopted
in
conformity
with
an
sec
rule.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
by
the
exchange?
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
since
the
change
in
the
exchange
rule
will
have
been
adopted
pursuant
to
an
sec
rule
adopted
under
the
act
then
i
think
the
full
panoply
of
powers
available
to
the
commission
for
violations
of
the
act
come
in
to
play
including
at
the
most
extreme
of
course
deregistration
of
exchanges,
also
termination
of
the
offices
of
officers
of
exchanges,
and
of
course
civil
one
and
criminal
proceedings
are
available
for
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes.
there
is
a
remedy
which
is
provided
by
the
administrative
procedures
act
also
remedy
provided
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
damage
remedies
would
not
be
provided
nor
are
they
required.
i
would
submit.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
there
might
be
--
there
is
a
developing
body
of
law
in
which
individuals
have
sought
to
sue
for
violation
of
exchange
rule.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
for
damages.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
two
questions
from
the
bench
yesterday
afternoon.
first,
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
of
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
exchange
act,
in
a
particular,
a
draft
which
utilized
the
word
uniform,
uniform
rights
and
that
matter
is
laid
out
at
pages
20
and
21
of
sec's
brief,
your
honor.
secondly,
it
has
been
suggested
that
perhaps
i
misunderstood
a
question
of
mr.
justice
white
with
regard
to
the
antitrust
situation
if
fixed
rates
are
abolished
on
may
1st
in
accordance
with
the
sec's
directive.
i
understood
the
question
to
relate
to
exchanges
and
i
answered
that
there
would
be
no
antitrust
liability,
obviously,
they
would
not
be
fixing
rates
anymore.
but
if
your
honors
question
related
to
the
situation
of
brokers,
members
of
exchanges,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
at
least
in
my
view,
there
is
no
question
that
merrill-lynch
and
bache
or
other
firms
got
together
and
fixed
the
rates
between
them,
they
would
be
subject
to
the
full
range
of
antitrust
liabilities
and
penalties.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
not
in
the
case
of
members
of
exchanges
fixing
rates
amongst
themselves
in
my
judgment.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
not
in
that
area,
in
my
judgment.
it
would
if
the
exchanges
again
reinstituted
fixed
rates
at
some
time
in
the
future.
and
assuming
no
change
in
the
statute.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
situation
i'm
addressing
myself
to.
there
would
no
longer
be
fixing
of
rates
by
the
exchange.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
the
antitrust
remedy
would
run
only
against
members.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
members
and
would
be
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
the
exchanges
would
be
out
of
the
business
in
fixing
rights.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
exactly,
your
honor,
exactly.
and
it's
that
jurisdiction
from
which
we
believe
that
exemption
is
derived.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
exactly.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
if
the
members
were
conspiring
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
right.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
exactly
sir.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
against
members
conspiring
themselves
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
after
fixed
rates,
exchange
fixed
rates
are
over.
and
i
just
want
to
make
that
clear
because
perhaps
i
haven't
been
clear
yesterday.
if
i
may
recapitulate,
your
honors,
our
position
in
this
case
which
of
course
deals
with
past
conduct
is
that
the
exchanges
are
entitled
to
an
antitrust
exemption.
for
this
limited
area
of
activity,
the
fixing
of
commission
rates
through
implied
repeal
of
the
antitrust
laws
on
the
twin
grounds
of
first,
irreconcilability
of
the
two
statutory
schemes.
and
secondly,
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
under
the
antitrust
laws
would
create
a
conflict
with
sec
jurisdiction
and
would
prevent
the
functioning
of
the
exchange
act
and
this
presents
the
different
case
which
this
court
reserved
in
silver.
now,
mr.
shapiro
yesterday
afternoon
if
i
understood
him
correctly
suggested
that
there
might
be
various
degrees
of
exemption
including
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
in
the
sec,
depending
on
the
type
of
procedure
utilized
by
the
sec
whether
it
was
action
or
inaction
or
a
formal
order
or
whatnot
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
argument
dealt
rather
much
on
form
over
substance.
but
in
any
event,
i
would
suggest
that
the
argument
derives
no
support
from
either
section
19
(b)
of
the
exchange
act
and
certainly
not
from
the
implied
repeal
cases.
because
either
the
exchange
act
creates
an
implied
exemption
or
it
does
not.
i
failed
to
see
any
room
for
shades
of
gray
in
a
matter
of
that
area
and
it
seems
to
me
that
certainly
the
exchanges
of
this
country
are
entitled
to
know
with
some
certainty
what
conduct
on
their
part
is
lawful
and
what
is
not.
mr.
shapiro
also
argued
if
i
understood
him
correctly
that
there
could
be
no
repugnancy
in
this
situation
and
therefore
no
exemption
until
and
unless
the
sec
actually
issued
a
formal
order
to
the
exchange
to
fix
commission
rates
and
this
is
a
mirror
image,
i
believe
of
the
what
i
regard
as
a
concession
in
the
department
of
justice's
brief
at
page
48
that
if
there
were
a
formal
order
by
the
sec
to
the
exchanges
to
fix
rates,
no
antitrust
liability
could
arise.
now,
by
limiting
this
concession
to
a
formal
order,
i
would
submit
that
the
argument
fails
to
recognize
the
unique
statutory
scheme
of
the
exchange
act
and
of
section
19
(b)
which
does
not
provide
for
a
direct
sec
regulation
by
a
formal
order.
it
is
not
a
public
utility
type
regulatory
statute.
it
has
provided
for
a
system
of
exchange
self-regulation.
the
exchanges
first
themselves
on
their
own
initiative
adopt
rules.
the
sec
has
the
power
if
it
deems
those
rules
objectionable
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
standards
to
first
to
request
an
exchange
to
change
them
and
if
the
exchange
does
so,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
if
the
exchange
refuses
the
request,
then
and
only
then
does
the
sec
have
to
proceed
by
a
formal
hearing
and
an
order
or
a
rule.
so
that
the
argument
which
mr.
shapiro
made,
it
seems
to
me
would
in
essence
re-write
section
19
(b)
of
the
exchange
act
by
requiring
an
order
whereas
the
act
itself
indicates
that
request
by
the
sec
in
compliance
by
the
exchange
are
sufficient
to
achieve
the
statutory
objectives
without
a
hearing
and
without
an
order.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
now,
in
that,
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
exactly.
in
that
situation
your
honor,
let's
assume
that.
the
exchange
adopts
a
rule.
the
--
it
has
to
be
pre-filed
with
the
sec
three
weeks
before
it
becomes
effective.
the
sec
looks
it
over,
finds
nothing
objectionable.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
it
has
the
power
as
you've
indicated
and
it
has
the
duty
i
would
submit
under
the
statute
to
request
and
if
request
is
refused,
to
order
the
exchange
to
change
it
if
it
doesn't
comport
with
the
statutory
standards.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
so
that
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
do
not
accept
that
test
because
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
test
that
this
court
laid
down
in
the
silver
case.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
in
the
silver
case
as
i
read
it,
what
this
court
was
saying
was
this.
what
may
be
necessary
to
make
the
act
work
in
a
given
case
would
be
implied
repeal
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
did
not
say,
as
i
read
it,
what
might
be
necessary
to
make
the
act
work
would
be
a
particular
rule
or
practice
of
an
exchange.
that
sir,
in
my
judgment,
is
where
the
fill
court,
the
seventh
circuit,
went
off
the
tracks.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
that
certainly
is
my
position
your
honor
and
it's
because
of
the
existence
of
the
sec's
jurisdiction
and
also
because
i
don't
understand
the
fundamental
justice
and
fairness
of
holding
an
exchange
liable
for
trouble
damages
for
doing
something
that
a
government
agency
has
power
to
stop
but
does
not
stop
and
i
think
that
there
is
an
exemption
in
those
circumstances.
i
think
there's
an
exemption
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
it
comes
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
find
that
this
may
be
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
i
think
i
analogize
it
to
parker
against
brown
which
was
argued
yesterday.
it
comes
close
to
government
action.
its
inaction
but
to
me
it
has
the
effect
of
action
because
the
hand
is
withheld
when
the
hand
could
have
been
stretched
out
and
stop
the
action
by
this
private
party
but
instead
the
government
agency
doesn't
do
so.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
precisely,
your
honor
and
the
exchange
--
the
sec
does
know
because
rules
as
i
said
have
to
be
filed
in
advance
for
scrutiny
and
if
there's
something
wrong
in
our
rules,
such
as
the
commission
fixing
rule,
they
can
say,
“stop
it.”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
have
said
“stop
it”
as
of
may
1st.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
would
argue
that
it
has
the
legal
effect
of
approval
since
they
have
the
effect
to
--
the
power
to
disapprove.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
i'm
certainly
aware
of
that
procedure
for
tariffs.
i
believe
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
if
i'm
not
mistaken
perhaps
also
under
the
shipping
act
but
that
is
not
the
same
as
the
procedure
in
this
case
because
those
tariffs
as
i
understand
those
acts
require
some
affirmative
action
by
the
agency.
in
this
case,
the
structure
of
the
statute
is
such
that
no
affirmative
action
is
required
in
order
for
the
exchange
rules
on
whatever
subject
to
become
effective.
affirmative
action
by
the
agency
is
required
only
to
set
them
aside
and
therefore,
in
action,
has
to
me
as
i
said
the
effect,
the
same
effect
as
affirmative
action
and
the
result
should
be
the
same
in
terms
of
antitrust
exemption,
i
would
submit.
the
--
in
effect
that
the
result
of
mr.
shapiro's
argument
would
mean
this
that
in
order
to
avoid
antitrust
liability,
an
exchange
would
have
to
refuse
a
request
from
the
sec
even
though
it
was
perfectly
willing
to
do
what
the
sec
asked
it
to
do
and
precipitate
a
hearing,
precipitate
an
order
and
then
at
last
come
to
rest
with
its
absolution
and
i
submit
that
that
would
be
a
charade,
a
sham
and
hardly
a
usual
exercise.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
of
course
not.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
of
course
not.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
i
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
the
--
i
think
it's
quite
clear
under
this
court's
decision
and
i
believe
gulf
utilities
that
the
public
interest
standards
which
are
embraced
in
the
exchange
act
19
(b)
would
include
competitive
considerations
and
i
say
also
that
those
considerations
have
been
considered
by
the
sec
in
the
past
as
is
reflected
in
this
record.
in
fact,
going
as
far
back
as
1941
in
the
multiple
trading
case
where
they
brought
a
proceeding
against
the
exchange
on
anticompetitive
grounds.
those
factors
have
been
considered
and
as
i
said
yesterday,
they
have
been
considered
with
the
active
assistance
of
the
department
of
justice
which
is
intervened
in
the
hearings
which
the
sec
has
held
under
subject.
now,
i
would
submit
your
honors
that
the
argument
of
mr.
shapiro
means
that
if
there
can
be
exemption
only
where
there's
an
order
there
is
no
exemption
and
this
would
repeal
the
doctrine
of
implied
repeal
and
would
result
in
endless
litigation
rather
than
regulation.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
