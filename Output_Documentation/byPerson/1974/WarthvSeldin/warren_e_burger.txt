we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-2024,
warth
against
seldin.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
mrs.
logan-baldwin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now
they
don't
mean
that
ordinance
to
make
it
multi-racial,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
on
this
record,
we
could
make
the
determination,
tell
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
with
the
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
something
inherently
wrong
or
undesirable
for
people
who
want
to
have
a
lot
that's
a
half
acre
or
an
acre
or
two
acres
on
which
they
rear
their
families?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
the
people
do
want
that
kind
of
space?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
rules,
do
you
regard
that
is
well
pleaded
fact
or
is
it
a
conclusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
a
well
pleaded
fact
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
under
the
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
an
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
thesis
that
you
advanced
here,
i
suppose
that
if
there
were
an
area
in
an
20
miles
or
30
miles
out
of
a
large
city
which
was
laid
out
for
minimum
10-acre
lots,
10-acre
tracks
for
people
who
wanted
to
have
a
lot
of
space
and
perhaps
ponies
for
their
children
and
what
not,
that
would
be
vulnerable
to
the
constitutional
attack
you
made
as
soon
as
the
low
income
housing
began
to
press
up
against
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
difference
in
principle
from
what
you're
advocating
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
of
course,
if
10,000
--
if
20,000
square
feet
can
be
made
out
as
exclusionary,
then
10
acres
very
clearly
would
be
more
exclusionary,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hartman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-2024,
warth
against
seldin
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
