justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
penfield
better
homes,
the
one
that
you
mentioned,
had
a
plan
denied?
did
they
ever
seek
to
review
the
action
of
the
zoning
commission
in
the
new
york
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
before
the
filing
of
this
suit
in
the
district
court
had
the
penfield
better
homes
application
been
turned
down?
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
metro-act
a
builder?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
builder?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
land
limitation,
mrs.
baldwin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
minimum
lot
size?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
half
an
acre?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
other
qualifications
could
tell
penfield
what
they
ought
to
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
logan-baldwin,
supposing
that
we
were
to
rule
in
your
favor
on
standing
in
the
second
circuit
or
the
district
court
were
to
rule
on
your
favor
on
the
constitutional
question,
as
a
result
of
that
ruling,
would
there
be
any
identifiable
parcel
of
land
or
building
that
would
be
then
available
for
your
clients?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
tell
us
from
the
record
what
the
parcel
would
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
simply
as
a
result
of
the
ruling
that
i've
describe.
could
you
point
to
an
identifiable
parcel
that
would
then
be
available?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
they
still
pending?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
--
does
the
person
own
the
land
or
have
an
option
on
the
land?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
it
grant
a
special
use
permit
to
give
a
plan
unit
development
under
the
town
of
penfield?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
surely
answer
that
yes
or
no,
can't
you?
does
it
or
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
what
you're
complaining
about
is
that
the
board
refused
to
grant
a
special
use
permit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
your
little
confusing
standing
with
valid
defense
to
the
constitutional
claim
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question.
in
other
words,
you
say
that
he
would
have
standing
if
he
made
a
valid
constitutional
attack
on
the
ordinance,
but
the
two
or
somewhat
separate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
if
penfield
homes
had
gone
over
to
the
federal
court
right
after
they
were
denied
and
said
this
particular
application
was
denied
for
this
reason,
they
would
have
standing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
regardless
of
the
merits
that
are
constitutional
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
ordinance
permit
an
option
or
to
make
any
application
for
variances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
rochester
home
builders
itself
engaged
in
construction,
or
is
it
a
trade
association
whose
members
engaged
in
construction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it's
primarily
on
an
association
--
does
it
secondarily
engaged
in
construction
itself?
