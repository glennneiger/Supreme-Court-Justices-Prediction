so
the

there
are
some

any
zoning
laws
at
all.
justice

f.
powell,

houston,
texas.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
an
attack
on
the
zoning
laws
and
practices
of
penfield,
new
york,
a
town
adjacent
to
rochester.
petitioners
alleged
the
construction
of
low
and
moderate
cost
housing
suitable
for
persons
of
low
and
moderate
income
has
been
prevented
by
the
zoning
practice
of
penfield.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
agree
with
these
courts.
for
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
none
of
the
petitioners
has
alleged
facts
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
threshold
requirement
of
standing
to
sue
in
the
federal
courts.
certain
of
them,
in
particular
the
low-income
minority
group
plaintiffs,
have
not
shown
that
they
personally
have
been
injured
by
the
challenged
zoning
practices.
other
petitioners
based
their
claim
to
relief
on
the
legal
rights
of
third
parties.
as
no
statute
grants
them
a
right
of
action,
we
find
no
justification
for
departing
from
the
rule
that
normally
precludes
litigants
from
asserting
the
legal
rights
of
others
as
basis
of
their
claim
to
relief.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
mr.
justice
brennan
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
