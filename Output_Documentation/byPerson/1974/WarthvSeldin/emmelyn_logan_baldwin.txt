ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court,
western
district
of
new
york,
originally
dismissed
the
complaint
on
two
grounds.
none
of
the
petitioners
had
alleged
standing
to
sue
and
that
no
claim
was
stated.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirms
solely
on
the
ground
that
none
of
the
petitioners
have
standing
to
sue.
thus,
the
record
before
this
court
consists
only
of
the
complaints
of
the
plaintiffs,
the
motion
papers
of
the
respondents
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
affidavits
in
opposition
to
that
motion
to
dismiss.
the
record
then
as
it
stand
must
be
reviewed
by
assuming
that
all
of
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaints
are
true
and
that
the
complaints
must
be
read
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
construction
of
those
allegations
by
the
complainant
and
to
grant
any
relief
that
could
be
possibly
granted
with
the
fair
and
liberal
reading
of
that
complaint.
the
basic
complaint
of
the
petitioners
is
that
the
zoning
ordinance
of
the
town
of
penfield,
new
york
on
its
face
and
as
applied
is
illegal
and
unconstitutional
being
racially
discriminatory.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
any
of
the
petitioners
have
alleged
injury
in
fact
and
that
injury
being
within
a
zone
of
interest
of
a
constitutional
or
statutory
provision
which
the
petitioners
alleged
that
the
respondents
have
violated.
the
petitioners
before
the
court
are
basically
three
groups
or
three
categories.
first
of
all,
the
petitioners
are
low
and
moderate
minority
income
persons
who
claim
that
they
had
been
forbidden
or
excluded
from
residing
in
the
town
of
penfield
by
the
operation
of
the
town
of
penfield
racially
exclusionary
zoning
ordinance.
secondly,
the
petitioners
are
organizations
and
associations
of
persons
whose
members
have
been
actively
involved
in
efforts
to
amend
the
zoning
ordinance
of
the
town
of
penfield
to
permit
the
construction
of
low
moderate
multi-racial
income
housing
there,
or
who
have
actually
made
proposals
for
the
construction
of
such
housing
in
the
town
of
penfield
all
to
know
avail.
first
of
these
groups
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
your
honor,
our
contention
is
that
the
home
builders
and
other
private
builders
and
entities
have
actually
made
proposals
in
the
form
of
housing
construction
which
would
be
within
a
range
which
can
be
purchase
by
low
and
moderate
multi-racial
persons.
the
town
has
arbitrarily
refused
to
grant
variances,
exceptions
and
so
forth
to
a
very
rigid
zoning
ordinance
which
dictates
the
construction
only
of
very
expensive
and
exclusive
housing,
so
that
the
application
of
the
zoning
ordinance
dictates
a
racial
stratification
and
population.
the
first
of
the
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
there
are
numbered
instances,
your
honor,
of
attempts
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes
your
honor,
and
let
me
clarify
that.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
suggested
that
there
really
weren't
that
kind
of
concrete
proposal.
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
misreading
of
the
record.
the
fact
is
that
both
the
rochester
home
builders
and
other
entities
such
as
penfield
better
homes
which
is
a
member
of
petitioner
housing
council
have
actually
tried
to
have
such
construction
approved
in
the
town
of
penfield.
all
of
those
efforts
have
been
denied,
all
those
applications.
the
penfield
better
homes
application
to
rezone
was
denied
by
the
town
on
the
basis
that
the
housing
was
not
appropriate
or
consistent
with
the
use
of
the
adjacent
properties,
which
is
single
family
dwelling.
i
think
this
case
falls
beyond
eventhough
its
other
cases
which
the
second
circuit
suggested
are
concrete
housing
proposals.
all
efforts
here
have
been
totally
frustrated,
the
far
worst
situation
to
name
those
other
cases.
and
i
might
point
out
with
respect
to
the
rochester
home
builders,
they
allege
in
their
complaint,
not
only
have
they
made
these
various
and
numerous
applications
for
exception
to
the
zoning
ordinance,
but
that
the
town
of
penfield
has
threatened
that
if
they
pursue
this
lawsuit,
if
they
try
to
rectify
the
exclusionary
zoning
ordinance
that
they
will
not
be
allowed
to
do
business
in
the
ordinary
course
of
doing
business
with
the
public
officials
of
the
town
in
the
ordinary
course
of
construction
of
exclusive
housing
in
the
town.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
they
did
not.
they
possibly
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief
could
have
done
so.
but
the
mere
fact
that
they
did
not
pursue
that
course,
of
course,
does
not
prevent
them
from
proceeding
as
a
part
of
a
membership
organization
to
the
federal
court
to
get
redress
for
these
illegal
acts
pursuant
to
the
statutes
and
the
constitution.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
it
does,
your
honor.
the
whole
penfield
better
homes
application
is
included
in
the
record
as
a
part
of
the
affidavit
of
mrs.
mcnab,
and
i
believe
the
date
is
1971
for
the
conclusion
of
the
denial
of
that.
and
the
immediate
preceding
acts
on
--
the
acts
immediately
preceding
the
filing
of
this
complaint
were
specific
and
concrete
proposals
of
another
organization
metro-act
of
rochester
for
the
town
of
penfield
to
amended
zoning
ordinance
so
that
this
construction
could
take
place.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
metro-act
is
a
civic
organization.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
it
is
not
a
builder.
it
has
not
engaged
in
construction
itself.
it
has
engaged
to
the
number
of
efforts
to
encourage
construction.
one
of
its
members,
mrs.
mcnab,
whose
affidavit
i
have
just
referred
to,
is
a
member
of
penfield
better
homes,
so
there
is
an
interaction
between
the
group
plaintiffs
and
their
efforts
to
build
low
and
moderate
income
housing
in
the
town
of
penfield.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
the
complaint
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
zoning
ordinance
is
racially
discriminatory
and
therefore,
illegal
and
unconstitutional.
and
that
there
be
an
appropriate
zoning
ordinance
drafted,
proposed
and
enacted.
it
simply
the
same
type
of
relief
that
this
court
has
granted
in
a
number
of
the
cases
involving
racial
discrimination.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
this
--
this
court
has
only
the
standing
issue,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
two
choices
in
terms
of
dealing
with
this
case.
you
could
certainly
remand
the
second
circuit,
telling
it
to
proceed
with
the
further
consideration
of
whether
a
claim
is
stated
on
its
face.
i
think,
however,
that
this
court
could
also
remand
to
the
second
circuit
with
direction
because
the
record,
i
think,
clearly
establishes
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
a
claim
is
stated.
this
is
a
typical
a
claim
of
racial
discrimination
pleaded
in
the
most
traditional
such
form
and
there
are
many
cases
of
this
court
which
would
indicate
that
this
is
a
properly
stated
claim.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
i
think
the
record
would
permit
this
court
to
remand
with
directions.
i
think
they're
clearly
two
choices
though.
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
standing,
and
that
is
the
only
question
which
the
second
circuit
reached.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
i
don't
think,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
referred
to
a
question
of
rightness,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
i
think
there
could
be
no
such
reading
on
this
record.
rightness
would
involve
a
consideration
of
whether
the
issues
have
reached
the
point
of
administrative
finality.
this
zoning
ordinance
was
adopted
in
1962.
we
have
had
numerous
applications
of
the
zoning
ordinance.
its
--
its
pattern
of
enforcement
is
clear.
the
plaintiffs
clearly
can
show
that
that
pattern
of
enforcement
is
totally
racially
exclusionary.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
i
think,
your
honor
that
in
a
case
of
racial
discrimination,
such
an
order
directing
affirmative
relief,
it
has
been
a
part
of
a
district
court
handling
of
the
case,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
here.
i
think
though
again
if
i
could
focus
on
the
one
issue
that
is
before
the
court,
and
that
is
standing,
and
that
as
to
the
nature
of
relief,
that
is
within
the
providence
of
the
district
court.
there
of
course
has
been
no
proof,
no
depositions,
no
interrogatories,
we
maintained
it.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
that
the
district
court
only
your
honor,
the
second
circuit.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
that's
correct.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
okay.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
the
town
of
penfield,
new
york
is
virtually
a
100%
white
population.
in
the
1960
census,
its
population
was
12,601.
now,
only
23
of
those
persons
were
blacks.
in
the
1970
census,
the
population
of
the
town
had
practically
doubled
to
23,782
persons.
at
that
time,
there
were
only
60
black
persons.
the
ordinance
of
the
town
is
so
drafted
that
there
cannot
be
any
construction
there
except
exclusive
housing.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
it
is.
it
is
one
of
the
suburban
towns
which
encircle
the
city
of
rochester.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
not
at
all.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
it's
an
entire
metropolitan
area,
persons
work
and
live
in
both
penfield
and
rochester;
totally
interchange
a
population,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
that
would
include
the
cost
of
land.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
in
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
in
terms
of
minimum
lot
size,
it's
roughly
20,000
square
feet,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
what
the
experts
who
examine
the
zoning
ordinance
suggests
as
a
reasonable
size
of
lot,
that
is
half
of
that,
roughly
10,000
square
feet.
the
zoning
ordinance
permits
the
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
the
experts
are
city
planners
who
have
filed
an
affidavit
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners.
it
appears
in
the
record
beginning
at
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
these
are
persons
who
actually
are
involved
in
drafting
of
ordinances,
involved
in
the
study
of
zoning
ordinances.
all
of
--
two
of
these
experts
have
participated
in
actual
studies
of
zoning
ordinances
including
the
town
of
penfield
ordinance
on
behalf
of
the
metropolitan
governments
of
the
rochester
area.
and
in
that
study
which
was
conducted
in
1970,
the
experts
concluded
that
the
only
reason
for
the
total
absence
of
low
and
moderate
income
housing
in
the
suburban
towns
including
the
town
of
penfield
is
racial
prejudice.
so
that
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
the
one,
mr.
kling
is
a
professor
at
the
university
of
rochester.
he
is
generally
known
as
an
urban
planner.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
professor
of
urban
planning,
i
believe.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
i
believe,
mr.
kling
has
a
phd
in
urban
planning
from
the
university
of
michigan.
he
is
a
present
--
presently
teaching
both
at
the
university
of
rochester
and
the
st.john
fisher's
college.
mr.
tatikin
is
a
member
of
the
municipal
research
agency
of
the
city
of
rochester,
a
research
institution
that
undertook
the
study
of
zoning
in
1970.
and
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes.
well,
all
of
them
are
--
have
been
as
careers
involved
in
considerations
of
what
are
permissible
land
uses
and
spaces
in
communities.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
their
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
they
examine
this
ordinance
from
the
standpoint
of
the
health
and
safety
factors
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
they
don't
have
to
be
experts
in
the
constitution.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
that
is
not
inherently
wrong.
what
i'm
suggesting
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
there's
nothing
in
this
case
that
would
prevent
those
persons
freely
owning
that
kind
of
property.
this
case
is
directed,
your
honor,
solely
to
the
affirmative
acts
of
officials
of
a
town
to
so
classify
and
so
zone,
so
as
to
exclude
racial
minorities.
that
is
what's
at
issue,
the
affirmative
acts.
there
is
nothing
here
in
this
case
that
would
prevent
ordinary
uses
of
land
by
private
individuals
in
terms
of
space
if
they
wanted
to
acquire
that
space.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
the
record
doesn't
address
itself
to
that
specifically,
your
honor.
there
are
according
to
census
figures,
60
blacks
as
of
the
1970
census.
there
is
a
housing
study
in
the
record
of
the
town
of
penfield
itself
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
persons
with
the
large
incomes
of
course
are
occupying
very,
very
expensive
houses
there.
of
the
zoning
ordinance,
only
3%
or
three-tenths
of
1%
permits
multifamily
construction.
and
there
again,
the
requirements
of
space
for
apartments
and
other
amenities
such
as
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no,
not
on
its
face.
the
effect
of
this
ordinance
as
it
applies
is
to
exclude
the
whole
class
of
people
and
those
that
class
of
people
is
defined,
your
honor,
as
persons,
minority
persons
who
earn
roughly
between
$5,000.00
and
$11,000.00
per
year
and
who
can
afford
a
single-family
dwelling
costing
no
more
than
$20,000.00
in
an
apartment
unit
winning
for
no
more.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
your
honor
that
is
the
practical
effect
of
this
ordinance.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
arguably
so,
your
honor.
the
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
in
the
last
analysis,
our
allegations
are
the
ordinance
is
aimed
at
minorities,
blacks
and
spanish
americans
and
in
fact,
the
studies
of
its
applications
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes,
but
the
impact
of
the
ordinance
is
on
the
racial
minority,
the
black
and
the
spanish
americans.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
those
are
the
persons
who
are
predominantly
seeking
this
housing
and
against
which
the
ordinance
primarily
excludes.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
the
first
evidence,
your
honor,
is
the
housing
study
of
monroe
county
which
was
conducted
1970
which
indicated
that
the
primary
motivation
for
the
exclusion
of
this
type
housing
is
to
exclude
blacks.
the
second
indication
is
in
the
record
in
the
1972
study
of
the
town
itself,
which
concludes
that
its
impact
is
totally
exclusionary.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
certainly,
your
honor,
that's
precisely
the
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
those
are
the
allegations,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
that
--
that
the
motivation
is
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
fact
which
evidence
can
be
adduced.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no,
your
honor,
no.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
that
could
by
to
accounts
costing
$21,000.00
if
that
was
the
question.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
in
the
city
of
rochester
was
questioned.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
in
penfield?
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
there
again,
i
don't
think
the
record
speaks
particularly
to
that
question,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
right.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
not
all,
no,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes,
your
honor.
then
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
the
record
has
a
report
of
the
town
of
penfield
which
examines
its
total
land
area.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
yes
your
honor,
there
have
been
several
proposals
that
we've
talked
about.
obviously
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
there
are
some
so-called
plan
unit
development
proposals
that
are
in
some
stage
of
being
processed.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
in
the
case
of
plan
unit
developments,
there
is
actually
ownership
or
options
and
those
could
proceed.
i
think
it's
very
interesting
to
note
the
experience
to
the
town
of
penfield
with
the
plan
unit
development
ordinance
in
order
to
accent
what
i'm
saying
about
racial
prejudice.
this
type
of
an
amendment
to
the
ordinance
is
ordinarily
viewed
as
a
way
in
which
you
can
construct
low
and
moderate
multi-racial
income
housing.
they
enacted
the
ordinance,
but
when
builder
sought
to
use
that
ordinance
to
construct
this
housing,
they
--
the
town
board
specifically
responded,
reacted
to
citizen
pressure
suggesting
that
this
would
permit
those
people
to
move
in
and
property
values
would
go
down
and
reduced
the
permissible
density,
so
that
what
started
out
to
be
the
utilizing
of
the
ordinance
for
the
construction
of
this
type
of
housing
resulted
in
either
those
projects
being
abandoned
completely.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
there's
a
special
--
an
especially
cumbersome
process
you
might
say.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes,
i
think
that's
a
special
use.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
they
have
not
processed
completely
these
plan
unit
development
applications.
our
allegation
is
that
if
they
have
either
delayed
them
inordinately
or
so
modified
them
to
transform
them
to
exclusive
housing
so
that
essentially,
those
efforts
have
been
--
have
failed.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
your
honor
again,
i
don't
think
that
case
reaches
this.
we
have
here
only
a
questing
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no.
again,
what
we're
talking
about
here
are
affirmative
acts
to
the
town
of
penfield
to
exclude
minorities.
now,
we
have
to
of
course
have
our
day
court
on
those
allegations.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
yes.
but
again,
what
we're
talking
about
are
particular
individuals
who
make
a
claim
that
the
affirmative
acts
of
the
town
have
a
particular
effect
and
pattern
and
each
case
would
have
to
be
examined
on
its
own.
but
we're
saying
here
that
this
is
racially
motivated
and
it
is
the
same
as
the
town
hanging
a
sign
outside
the
town
of
penfield
that
minorities
are
not
wanted
here.
it
has
that
same
effect.
i'd
like
to
direct
my
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
again
your
honor
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
your
honor,
we're
on
the
racial
point.
we
obviously
have
to,
at
the
time
of
trial,
introduce
the
evidence
which
substantiates
that.
but
in
the
record,
the
conclusions
are
that
the
enforcement
of
this
ordinance
has
been
with
that
intent
in
mind.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
it
is
--
it's
totally
exclusionary.
in
fact,
the
town
of
penfield
has
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
at
all?
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
there
are
60
according
to
the
census.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
60
out
of
23,000.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
the
record
doesn't
show
where
those
60
and
who
those
60
are,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
that's
correct.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
yes.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
mr.
ortiz
was
the
only
person
who
worked
in
penfield.
there
are
members
of
plaintiff
metro-act
of
rochester
who
live
and
reside
in
the
town
of
penfield.
approximately,
9%
of
the
membership
of
plaintiff
metro-act
of
rochester
are
residents
of
the
town
of
penfield.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
thank
you.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
thank
you.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
your
honor,
i
think
again,
the
question
here
is
standing.
the
lower
court
would
be
the
province
of
the
lower
court
to
direct
the
appropriate
relief
if
the
injunction
is
granted
and
the
declaratory
judgment's
granted
and
the
zoning
ordinances
declared
unconstitutional,
there
might
not
be
any
need
for
any
further
relief
because
the
building
could
take
place
and
the
exclusionary
barriers
that
exist
would
be
eliminated.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
i
think
again
the
focus
and
the
question
for
this
court
is
standing.
have
these
plaintiffs,
these
petitioners
alleged
injury
in
fact
and
i
think
the
real
problem
with
the
argument
of
the
defendant-respondents
is
that
they
are
focusing
as
if
there
had
been
a
full
trial
on
the
merits,
as
if
we
had
aired
all
of
the
ramifications
of
the
zoning
ordinance.
we
have
had
opportunity
to
do
so.
all
of
the
low
income
minority
petitioners
as
is
confirmed
in
the
record
have
actively
sought
to
live
in
the
town
of
penfield.
mr.
ortiz
of
course
didn't
go
to
the
zoning
board
of
appeals
because
he
never
had
an
opportunity
to
have
either
a
rental
or
purchase
property
in
the
town
of
penfield.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no,
that's
not
correct.
he
indicates
in
his
affidavit
that
he
search
in
penfield
for
housing.
he
finally
had
to
move
to
waylon,
new
york
and
resides
in
waylon.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
well,
he
didn't
go
to
the
zoning
board
of
appeals,
he
look
for
houses
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
not
any
state
board.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no,
and
no
ordinance
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
and
no
ordinary
individual
would
have
any
relief
to
go
to
zoning
board
of
appeals
to
ask
them
to
give
him
a
particular
house
or
anything
like
that.
he
as
a
person
trying
to
find
housing
simply
went
to
look,
and
there
is
none
such
there.
the
injury
he
suffers
as
a
consequence
is
the
extraordinary
commuting
to
and
from
its
job
in
penfield.
the
living
in
an
environment
which
is
subject
or
which
has
poorer
schools,
which
has
less
community
services
and
so
forth.
these
are
real
injuries
i
submit.
the
type
of
injuries
that
this
court
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
there
have
--
there
are
in
the
record,
builders
applications
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
they
are
members
of
organizations
who
are
plaintiffs
your
honor.
and
i
submit
that
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
the
penfield
better
homes
is
a
member
of
the
housing
council
which
is
a
plaintiff,
and
rochester
home
builders
have
constructed
80%
of
the
housing
in
the
town
of
penfield
over
the
last
15
years.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
the
individual
plaintiffs
again
are
represented
through
associational
efforts.
mrs.
--
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
it
is
primarily
trade
association
whose
members
engaged
in
construction,
but
it
has
as
its
purpose
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record
to
facilitate
the
construction
of
housing
for
the
entire
community
including
low
moderate
income
housing.
ms.
emmelyn
logan-baldwin
no,
your
honor,
not
to
my
knowledge
and
i
don't
think
the
record
discloses
that
it
has.
