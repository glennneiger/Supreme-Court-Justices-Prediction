any
of
the
single
family
homes
owned
by
members
of
a
racial
minority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
it's
not
suggested
that
a
one
--
a
member
of
racial
minority
who
can
afford
it,
even
one
of
the
most
expensive
of
the
houses
is
precluded
from
building
or
buying
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
the
ordinance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
you
say
that
in
any
event,
the
allegation
and
all
we
have
is
the
allegations
and
if
the
standing
is
established
and
you
got
the
burden
of
proving
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
penfield?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
argument
anyway
is
he
didn't
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
association
of
which
penfield
was
a
member,
that's
he
attempted
to
do
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
to
what
members?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
an
organization
of
individuals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
of
association
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

again,
mrs.
baldwin,
i
think
you
have
said
indirectly
that
there
are
folks
here
who
own
or
have
options
upon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
among
the
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
or
the
applicants
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
name
particularly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
one
owned
or
have
options
upon
land
in
the
county?
now,
that
the
record
does
not
clearly
direct
itself
to
and
there's
a
reason
for
it,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
defendant's
motion,
rochester
home
builders
have
not
yet
in
move
to
intervene.
there
was
actually
no
written
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
town
to
the
home
builder's
application
to
intervene.
so,
there
were
no
responding
affidavits
coming
from
the
intervener
to
particularize
or
to
expand
upon
their
general
allegations
that
they
have
a
numerous
occasions
applied
for
relief
from
the
zoning
ordinance,
but
the
town
has
in
each
occassion
refused.
that
again
your
honor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
any
of
the
individual
plaintiffs.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
some
of
them,
some
of
the
individuals
whether
represented
parties
or
represented
by
other
parties?
are
there
such
according
to
this
record
will
actually
owned
land
or
have
options
upon
land?
not
of
the
low
income
minority
plaintiffs
owned
or
have
options,
your
honor.
thank
you
your
honor,
i
believe
my
time
