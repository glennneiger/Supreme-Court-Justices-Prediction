what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
difficulty
with
qualification
if
i
don't
have
anything
with
person.
remember,
the
only
question
my
brother
blackmun
was
asking,
what
were
their
qualifications.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
their
expertise
in
the
constitution
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
should
i
say
if
any.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
don't
have
to
be
judges.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
there
any
negro
that
can
buy
$21,000.00
houses
in
rochester?

is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
there's
no
negro
in
the
rochester
area
that
can
afford
the
$21,000.00
house,
the
answer
is
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
if
it
was
in
the
record,
it
wouldn't
be
true.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
is
true
that
the
fact
that
$21,000.00-limit
does
not
exclude
all
negroes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
sign
that
said
minorities
with
less
than
$21,000.00
are
not
allowed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
on
the
racial
point
or
the
money
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
a
white
person
build
anything
out
there
for
less
than
$21,000.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
nobody
had.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
there
any
negroes
out
there
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
there
was
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
living
in
the
homes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
for
permission
to
buy
and
develop
his
own
home
below
$21,000.00
and
it
has
been
denied,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
they
have
a
right
of
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
this
group
has
a
right
or
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you
say
that
the
group
--
what's
the
name
of
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
was
ortiz
has
standing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
does
he
have
to
have
a
particular
parcel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
deny
him
standing
because
he
didn't
first
go
to
the
zoning
board.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
you
say
is
that
if
it
doesn't
buy
the
land,
he
has
no
cause
of
action,
and
if
he
does
buy
the
land,
he
might
have
a
cause
of
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
put
a
whole
lot
of
money
for
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we'll
talk
about
ortiz
for
the
time
being.
ortiz,
because
he
would
has
to
buy
this
land.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can't
do
that
without
owning
a
piece
of
land.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
make
the
application.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that
ortiz
did
try
to
put
up
anything
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
board
at
penfield
or
any
other
place
in
the
state
did
he
apply
for
relief.

thurgood
marshall
did
he
apply
to
any
state
board?
justice
thurgood
marshall
city
