mr.
james
h.
hartman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
take
issue
with
the
argument
just
made
and
that
there
are
instances
in
this
record
that
would
indicate
what
my
adversary
concludes.
first
of
all,
the
relief
sought
here
is
very,
very
sweeping.
it's
to
declare
the
zoning
ordinance
of
the
town
of
penfield
unconstitutional
to
enjoin
its
enforcement
and
to
require
a
new
ordinance
to
be
passed.
secondly,
we
have
these
individual
plaintiffs,
the
real
plaintiffs
were
originally
in
the
case,
people
who
are
indeed
members
of
minority
groups
and
who
are
members
of
--
who
are
poor,
who
are
poor
members
of
the
minority
groups.
now,
not
one
of
these
individuals
has
made
a
single
application
for
housing
in
penfield.
the
--
one
of
these
big
persons,
ms.
angela
reyes,
alleges
in
supporting
affidavits
which
were
submitted
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
this
complaint,
that
she'd
looked
around
for
two
years,
but
she
saw
a
broker
and
that
the
broker,
one
broker
was
helpful.
she
has
an
income
of
$931.00
a
month,
she
and
her
husband,
and
disposable
income
for
housing
of
$231.00
a
month.
that's
the
extent
of
her
and
that's
the
most
that's
alleged
by
any
plaintiff.
now,
they
say,
the
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
individual
plaintiff,
yes
your
honor,
which
i'd
like
to
treat
first.
then,
they
alleged
in
addition
that
the
in
the
complaint
that
the
zoning
ordinance
of
the
town
of
penfield
discriminates
against
minorities
because
it
hasn't
waived,
modified
and
the
administrators
of
that
ordinance
haven't
waived,
modified,
amended,
granted
building
permits
of
variances
of
any
kind
to
relieve
the
situation.
but
there's
not
a
single
application
for
such
a
permit
except
by
one
of
the
association
members
whose
not
a
plaintiff
and
who
is
not
a
party
--
doesn't
seek
to
be
a
party.
now,
we're
talking
about
a
very
broad
constitutional
affect
that
this
court
should
rule,
concerning
these
--
allowing
these
plaintiffs
to
have
standing.
because
we're
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
are
to
talk
in
terms
of
what
specifically
that
these
plaintiffs
do
to
create
a
fact
context
which
would
indicate
to
the
court
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
indeed
been
violated.
without
these
facts,
what
can
we
work
with?
what
relief
will
we
give?
will
the
relief
--
first
of
all,
the
adjudication
maybe
unnecessary
because
on
an
application
for
some
kind
of
relief
from
the
zoning
ordinance,
it
might
very
well
be
granted.
if
it's
denied,
at
least
some
controversy,
some
confrontation
with
the
town
or
its
administrative
agencies
would
have
taken
place
to
give
a
factual
context
within
which
to
make
a
constitutional
determination
of
this
import.
now
right
now,
none
of
these
affidavits
indicate
that
any
plaintiff
wants
to
live
in
penfield.
one
says,
“i
might
want
to
live
there”,
that's
ortiz's
affidavit.
reyes
doesn't
mention
wanting
to
live
in
the
penfield
or
that
they
will
live
in
penfield.
have
they
been
injured
or
is
this
allegation
and
their
position
totally
speculative?
because
if
the
relief
were
granted
which
they
seek,
the
abolition
in
effect
of
the
penfield
zoning
ordinance,
would
these
individual
plaintiffs
receive
themselves
any
substantial
relief?
and
have
they
been
injured?
they
have
a
personal
state
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
if
they
haven't
alleged,
they
try
to
get
into
penfield
or
that
they
even
desire
to
get
into
penfield?
isn't
this
kind
of
like
o'shea
against
littleton
where
the
relief
they
had
ripened
into
a
position
to
be
relieved
by
any
judgment?
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
this
manner
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
complaint
and
overlook,
the
litigation
that
would
take
place
to
the
outcome
of
that
litigation
and
determine
in
order
to
determine
standing
whether
that
outcome
would
in
effect
affect
these
plaintiffs.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
if
i
may
to
the
association
of
plaintiffs
and
what
i've
said
concerning
the
individual
plaintiffs
applies
to
the
associational
petitioners.
one
is
a
plaintiff,
metro-act.
one,
there
was
--
there
was
a
motion
made
to
bring
in
the
housing
council
of
the
monroe
county
area.
now,
that
motion
was
denied
because
standing
was
denied
for
all
the
other
petitioners.
and
the
motion
is
sort
of
surrounded
by
some
procedural
vagary
because
it
doesn't
refer
to
rule
19
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
indicate
when
a
party
should
be
joined
as
a
plaintiff
and/or
as
a
defendant
depending
on
the
circumstances.
in
any
event,
the
motion
to
bring
them
in
is
denied
and
they
seek
to
be
made
a
party
plaintiff,
and
it
is
that
housing
council
which
refers
to
penfield
better
homes
who
is
not
a
party
and
doesn't
seek
to
be
a
party.
now,
the
housing
council
is
basically
an
association
of
associations
and
public
agencies.
the
penfield
better
homes
did
indeed
at
one
time
apply
for
a
project
called
highland
circle
in
the
town
of
penfield
and
sought
variances
or
permits
or
actually
i
think
an
amendment
to
the
zoning
ordinance.
it
was
denied
and
that
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
denied
in
1969,
september
of
1969,
and
then
on
--
a
rehearing
was
had
in
november
of
'69,
and
on
january
12,
1970,
there
was
a
denial
of
any
further
public
hearing
and
these
are
in
the
appendix
at
pages
631,
881,
and
883.
now,
for
two
years,
penfield
better
homes
did
nothing.
they
have
done
nothing
yet.
housing
council
is
moved
to
be
brought
into
the
case
and
uses
penfield
better
homes
as
an
incident
to
give
stand.
but
housing
council
has
no
complaint
in
this
action.
if
housing
council
were
allowed
to
remain
standing
as
a
party
to
this
action,
there
are
no
allegations
because
they
have
not
yet
put
in
the
complaint.
now,
is
housing
council
derivatively
in
a
better
position
to
pursue
these
rights
than
is
penfield
better
homes
who
had
lawyers
made
the
application
was
turned
down
and
was
turned
down
on
three
grounds:
erosion
problems,
traffic
problems,
and
that
the
project
was
inconsonant
with
the
surrounding
neighborhood,
which
is
a
general
and
classical
way
that
variances
and
rezonings
are
turned
down
in
towns
that
inconsonant
with
the
neighborhood.
if
they
didn't
bring
the
action,
are
we
to
assume
that
that
was
done
on
racially
discriminatory
grounds?
if
penfield
better
homes
for
two
and
a
half
years
and
today
has
not
instituted
any
kind
of
action
or
proceeding
in
either
the
state
courts
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
in
federal
court
alleging
anything
no
less
racially
discriminatory
conduct
or
a
racially
discriminatory
effect
of
the
zoning
ordinance
to
town
of
penfield
is
housing
council
derivatively
to
assert
that
through
an
affidavit
of
mrs.
mcnab
who
is
not
yet
a
party
and
has
no
complaint?
mr.
james
h.
hartman
the
decision
is
in
the
record,
your
honor,
yes
sir.
the
decision
is
in
the
record
and
says
and
gives
as
its
reasons,
those
three
things
i've
related
to.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
i
don't
know
that
it's
because
of
they
wanted
to
build
a
housing
of
a
greater
density
and
would
ordinarily
be
allowed.
i
think
so,
i
think
so.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
i
think
because
it
was
for
higher
density
multifamily
housing
in
a
area
that
was
surrounded
by
residential
single-family
now.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
it
should
be
clear
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
it
has
two
methods
it
can
use
in
new
york
state
courts.
if
the
denial
was
done
in
an
administrative
manner
by
an
administrative
board,
it
can
take
a
proceeding
under
article
78
of
the
civil
practice
law
and
rules
which
is
a
review
in
a
nature
or
certiorari
mandamus,
etcetera.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
oh,
yes.
they
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
he
may
have
standing
in
the
federal
court
if
he
raises
a
federal
constitutional
issue,
certainly.
if
that
party
makes
himself
a
plaintiff
in
a
federal
action
and
says
because
of
this
instance,
in
this
factual
context,
when
i
confronted
the
town
of
penfield
and
sought
relief,
i
allege
that
they
denied
it
for
racially
discriminatory
reasons;
i
think
he
would
have
standing.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
well,
the
federal
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
no,
then
he
would
not
have
standing.
if
it
was
just
for
high
density
housing,
i
don't
think
he
have
standing.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
well,
he
would
if
he
raised
the
valid
constitutional
question
under
the
federal
constitution.
if
he
says
he's
been
deprived
of
property
--
if
he
would
allege,
he's
been
deprived
to
property
for
instance,
he
can't
develop
this
property.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
he
didn't
do
it.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
right,
that's
correct,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
yes,
yes
your
honor,
they
are
separate.
now,
i
say
he
would
have
standing
if
he,
his
question
--
his
constitutional
question
were
raised
in
a
specific
factual
context
which
is
lacking
here.
not
just
because
he
raises
the
constitutional
issue,
no,
no.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
that's
right,
they
would
have
standing
in
that
case,
but
in
this
record,
there
is
no
instance
of
that
and
i
say
an
associate
--
can
an
association
--
there
are
association
case
have
been
brought
and
it's
been
sustained
and
association
can
bring
a
case
in
certain
circumstances.
but
are
they
in
a
better
position,
then
penfield
better
homes
and
they
are
not
seeking
that
litigation.
they
have
joined
in
the
general
abstract
speculative
nature
of
the
case
before
this
court.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
not
to
my
reading
of
the
complaint.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
these
organizational
petitioners,
the
housing
council,
a
metro-act
too
is
in
association.
metro-act
talks
of
a
proposal.
that
proposal
is
exhibit
q,
the
next
to
the
affidavit
of
a
robert
warth
in
the
record,
a
proposal
that
they
presented
to
the
town
of
penfield.
now,
what
happened
and
it's
in
the
record
is
that
they
came
in
with
this
--
the
zoning
ordinance
of
town
of
penfield
is
89
printed
pages
and
it
covers
a
multitude
of
issues
which
are
properly
to
concern
of
local
government.
metro-act
comes
in
and
say,
we
made
a
proposal,
four
type-written
pages
which
starts
off
with
the
threat
of
litigation
if
you
don't
listen
to
us.
it
alludes
to
no
particular
property,
but
it
says
houses
ought
to
have
the
square
--
land
ought
to
be
7,000
square
feet
for
some
houses,
comes
in
again,
the
next
thing
is
40%
of
penfield
ought
to
be
zoned
for
this
and
something
for
that.
is
that
a
proposal
when
they
did
make
proposals
which
are
in
the
record
in
the
city
of
rochester
which
picks
sites,
which
gave
the
kind
of
housing,
which
show
the
kind
of
recreation,
which
went
into
the
many,
many
details
that
are
required
when
you
talk
about
a
proposal
for
legislation
by
a
town?
now,
can
metro-act
--
has
it
been
injured?
none
of
its
members
have
been
injured.
if
none
of
its
members
had
been
injured,
how
can
metro-act
come
in
and
say
it's
been
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
any
--
well,
metro-act,
there's
a
lot
of
people
who
were
interested
in
housing.
it
has
some
poor
members
of
minority
groups.
it
has
some
people
who
are
not
poor
members,
it
has
some
rich
people.
it
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
no,
no,
council
is
of
associations.
now,
if
the
individual
plaintiffs,
if
some
of
them
are
members
of
the
metro-act
and
they
haven't
described
a
specific
injury,
how
can
metro-act
now
derivatively
have
a
better
claim
than
any
of
these
individuals
would?
mr.
james
h.
hartman
no,
i
said
he
--
if
he'd
applied
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
i
said
that
group
doesn't
have
a
right
of
action.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
oh,
that
penfield
homes.
yes.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
if
mr.
--
i
said
that
they
would
have
standing
if
they
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
if
he
made
an
application
on
a
specific
parcel
to
build
the
particular
home
and
he
was
denied,
he
would
have
standing.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
well,
a
particular
application
could
be
a
tenant
for
an
apartment.
he
doesn't
have
to
really
have
an
apartment.
he
had
a
--
i
don't
even
think
that
it
may
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
that's
right.
now,
it
or
any
other
board,
let
me
add
this,
that
even
going
beyond
a
specific
interest
in
property
or
going
beyond
the
specific
parcel
of
property,
i
see
no
reason
if
relief
is
sought
from
the
town
of
penfield
that
some
steps
shouldn't
been
taken
to
confront
the
town
and
say
we
want
some
land
zone.
now,
whether
metro-act
does
it
or
mr.
ortiz
does
it
for
one
piece
of
land
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
no,
i
say
if
he
buys
the
land,
he
has
a
cause
of
action
after
he
has
applied
for
the
relief.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
but
metro-act
doesn't
have
to
put
up
money
for
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
that's
correct.
well,
if
he
needed
the
land,
but
i
don't
think
he
needs
the
land
to
make
that
application.
i
think
he
can
go
in
without
the
land
for
some
kind
of
relief.
they
mentioned
in
the
complaint
not
only
variances
and
permits,
your
honor,
they
mentioned
waivers
and
changes
in
zone.
now,
he
doesn't
have
to
have
land
for
that.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
i
would
think
so.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
i
see
no
reason
actually
and
i
tell
you,
if
he's
denied
a
hearing
on
the
application;
that
might
give
him
some
kind
of
standing.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
he
applies
for
--
he
first
had
to
submit
a
site
plan
if
it's
more
than
one
house
or
subdivision
plan
to
the
planning
board.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
right.
building
inspector
has
to
make
sure
they
comply
with
the
building
code
to
the
state
or
the
town.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
he
gets
a
building
permit
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
he
has
an
action
if
he
turned
down
on
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
basis
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
from
the
determination
of
the
enforcing
officer,
yes,
the
building
inspector.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
right.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
no,
he
goes
to
court
from
there
in
my
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
right,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
yes.
the
article
78
proceeding
and
the
zoning
board
has
final
jurisdiction
over
appeals
from
enforcing
officers
and
also
ab
initio,
if
you
will
jurisdiction
to
grant
variances.
if
he's
denied
there,
he
goes
right
to
the
court.
the
town
board
is
more
legislative.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
it's
discretion
--
great
deal
as
discretionary.
there
are
certain
cases,
new
york
state
cases
which
hold
instances
in
which
variances
are
proper
and
one
are
not,
and
some
of
the
things
are
that
there's
a
unique
problem
that
it
will
not
do
violence
to
the
general
character
of
the
town
and
that
kind
of
thing.
i
must
say
that
there's
a
lot
of
latitude
in
the
language
of
the
cases
as
well
as
the
authority
of
the
zoning
board
to
rule
on
these
things.
the
last
group
of
petitioners
here
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
forgot
one
organization
or
group
which
are
the
home
builders
and
they
seek
to
intervene.
and
they
say
that
they'd
been
--
that
number
one,
they
have
not
been
able
to
build
lower
middle
income
housing
because
of
this
racially
discriminatory
ordinance,
and
that
they've
been
injured.
that's
the
extent
of
it,
not
a
single
instance
of
a
single
home
builder
attempting
to
get
a
single
permit
or
make
an
application
for
a
single
variance
is
in
this
record.
and
these
people
are
in
a
position;
that's
their
business,
to
buy
land,
to
take
auctions
on
land,
to
get
into
contracts
for
the
purchase
of
land
and
go
in
and
get
variances
and
get
zoning
relief
because
they
do
it
all
the
time.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
yes,
your
honor.
contract,
then
the
optionee,
optionor
usually
they're
joined
in
by
the
owner
and
the
potential
purchaser.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
she
said
so
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
yeah,
but
it's
not
in
the
record
except
for
penfield
better
homes.
now,
there
are
some
parts
that
are
indeed
by
this
time,
they're
under
construction
but
the
time
that
complaint
--
the
part
ordinance
of
the
town
of
penfield
happens
to
say
that
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
pud,
plan
unit
development,
i'm
sorry.
we
use
it
everyday,
happens
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
this
is
because
we
recognize
the
need
for
housing
at
all
economic
levels.
now,
it's
a
new
ordinance,
it's
a
new
field,
but
there
are
four
puds,
plan
unit
developments
underway
at
some
stage
in
penfield.
now,
these
home
builders,
as
i
say,
not
a
single
instance
in
the
record
of
a
single
application
by
those
in
the
best
position
to
test
this
ordinance.
so
can
again,
the
association
of
home
builders
derived
or
obtained
derivatively
a
better
right,
can
they
assume
an
injury
when
no
member
has
pleaded
an
injury,
and
i
say
again
it's
just
--
there's
a
broad
side
attack
that
they've
been
threatened
about
bringing
the
suit.
there
was
a
motion
made
here
and
900
pages
of
material
came
in
and
not
one
specification
on
that,
and
apparently
didn't
dissuade
him
from
trying
to
intervene
in
the
suit.
so,
i
don't
know
where
that
statement
comes
in,
there's
just
no
way
that
i
could
state
anything
about
it.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
verify
a
support
that
that
if
they
brought
the
suit,
they'll
be
in
trouble
in
penfield.
now,
the
third
group
of
petitioners
are
plaintiffs
who
sued
in
the
nature
of
taxpayers
and
i
don't
think
that
i
ought
to
address
myself
to
that
at
length.
i
think
that
simply
frothingham
against
mellon
and
deramus
against
the
board
of
education
are
preclusive
on
this
kind
of
a
taxpayer
suit.
here,
you
have
taxpayers.
in
the
city
of
rochester
who
attempt
--
they
assert
that
they
have
to
pay
higher
taxes
in
rochester
because
in
penfield,
there
is
not
any
tax
abated
housing.
therefore,
rochester
bears
a
greater
portion
of
tax
abated
housing
and
increases
their
real
estate
taxes.
well,
i
just
want
to
use
the
word
remote.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
specific
out
of
pocket
injury.
they
don't
attack
a
spending
ordinance
--
spending
law
statute
or
ordinance,
nor
one
are
concerned
with
taxing.
in
addition
to
which,
they
don't
attack
one
in
their
own
municipality
or
they
attack
it
in
an
adjoining
municipality,
an
ordinance
which
this
court
has
held
is
concerned
--
properly
concerned
with
the
interest
it
seeks
to
protect
that
of
land
use,
and
typically,
the
concern
of
local
government.
there
has
been
no
good
faith
showing
of
a
pocket
book
injury,
there
are
some
figures
that
taxes
have
gone
up,
but
it
only
gone
up
all
over
not
only
in
the
city
of
rochester.
how
are
you
going
to
compare
that
or
assert
that's
a
result
of
penfield
zoning
ordinance,
i
don't
know.
as
i
said,
this
is
a
very
--
a
decision
here
giving
standing
in
this
case
would
have
some
very,
very
broad
far
reaching
and
sweeping
effects
on
the
municipalities
of
50
states;
this
is
a
typical
zoning
ordinance,
pretty
typical
zoning
ordinance
and
so
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
there's
a
fair
of
any
of
these
plaintiffs
or
petitioners
to
show
a
personal
state
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
there's
a
failure
to
show
a
definitive
injury.
there's
a
failure
to
show
a
definitive
factual
context
within
which
this
court
can
test
a
serious
constitutional
question.
i
think
it
misses
the
point
so
clearly
made
in
baker
against
carr
that
such
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
controversy
as
to
assume
that
concrete
adverseness
which
sharpens
the
presentation
of
issues
upon
which
the
courts
so
largely
depends
for
illumination
of
difficult
constitutional
questions
is
missing
here.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
that's
right.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
on
the
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
well,
under
the
facts
you've
given
me,
no.
unless
an
allegation
is
made
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
not
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
i
don't
think
you
have
it.
i
think,
however,
you
would
have
standing
--
mr.
james
h.
hartman
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
i
don't
know,
i
don't
think
they've
gone
that
far.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
that's
right.
they
didn't
even
go
to
that
far,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
--
i
think
if
you
said
i
can't
find
housing
in
penfield
because
i've
been
--
because
i
try
to
buy
this
property
and
the
owner
told
me
i'm
not
going
to
sell
it
to
you
because
i
don't
like
united
states
supreme
court
justices
or
i
don't
like
your
color
or
you
race,
for
that,
you
have
a
cause
of
action,
you
have
standing.
mr.
james
h.
hartman
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
