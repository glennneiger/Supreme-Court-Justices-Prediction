justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
--
is
it
only
the
standing
issue
here?
i
suppose
it
is,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
court
was
wrong
below,
it
would
still
have
to
rule
on
whether
there
was
cause
of
action,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
class
is
just
to
minority
groups.
i
mean
other
people
with
the
same
income
limitations
have
the
same
problem
--
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
they
--
weren't
--
white
and
the
black
of
same
income
have
the
same
problem,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
boarding
a
house
such
only
they
can
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
arguably
is
--
well,
tell
me
why
it
isn't
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
whether
or
not
would
the
same
--
if
the
white
would
have
the
same
problem
affording
a
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
the
impact
on
them
anymore
than
on
a
poor
white?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
the
blacks
or
the
poor
blacks
and
not
poor
whites
were
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
individuals?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
record
clear
one
way
or
another
as
to
whether
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
organization
was
turned
down
was
because
it
wanted
to
build
houses
on
lots
that
were
smaller
than
provided
for
in
the
zoning
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
basis
for
saying
that
their
project
wouldn't
be
consonant
with
the
surroundings?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
clear
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
if
an
organization
applies
for
variance
to
build
other
than
a
single-family
dwellings
on
lots
of
specified
size
and
it's
turned
down
and
it
--
i
suppose
it
would
have
had
at
that
point
to
say
standing
to
litigate
in
the
state
court
as
to
whether
the
zoning
board
decided
correctly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
have
a
personal
stake
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
across
the
street
with
federal
court
had
said
that,
i've
been
heard
here
by
zoning
ordinance
that's
unconstitutional?
i
want
it
declared
it
unconstitutional,
would
you
say
it
didn't
have
standing?
you
may
not
agree
with
the
cause
of
action,
but
how
about
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
racially
discriminatory
reasons,
but
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
i
wanted
to
build
higher
density
housing
in
the
zoning
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
turned
--
he
was
denied
of
his
permit
for
that
reason,
and
he
goes
and
says
“the
zoning
ordinance
is
unconstitutional,
and
two
have
denied
me,
this
is
unconstitutional”.
now,
why
doesn't
he
have
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i'm
wrong,
did
mrs.
baldwin
said
there
were
some
plaintiffs
in
this
case
maybe
applicable
for
intervention
who
in
fact
had
options
or
own
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
she
just
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
i
go
at
penfield,
and
i
shop
for
a
house
and
read
the
papers,
look
at
the
advertisements,
talk
to
the
dealers,
and
i
just
discover
there
is
not
house
in
found
that
i
can
afford
because
there's
just
not
kind
of
housing
around.
now,
it
make
some
difference
out
of
it
and
your
reasoning
want
to
live
with
penfield
is
close
to
some
work
that
you
pick
--
suppose
to
a
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
save
a
lot
of
gasoline
and
it's
--
you
got
good
schools
there.
you
think
there
is
no
standing
for
him
to
attack
the
ordinance?
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
never
win
and
they
may
never
win
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
find
some
houses
and
i
couldn't
find
any
because
there's
any
that
i
can
afford
in
town,
and
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
maybe
a
terrible
cause
of
action
that
--
how
about
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
did,
some
of
these
individuals
would
have
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
would
suffice
for
standing,
then
some
of
these
individuals
would
have
standing.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
even
go
to
penfield.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
what
had
happen
to
that
cause
of
action.
