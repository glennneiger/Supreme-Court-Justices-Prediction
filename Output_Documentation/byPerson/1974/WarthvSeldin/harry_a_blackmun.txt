harry

if
you
prevail
here,
what
type
of
remedy
do
you
envisage?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
think
that
there
is
an
issue
here
of
justiciability
as
well
as
standing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
why
i
asked
you
about
the
type
of
remedy
you
envisaged
that
in
part
of
your
answer
was
i
take
it
that
you
would
expect
judicial
enforcement
of
a
--
the
drafting
of
a
new
ordinance.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
went
off
on
the
ground
also
that
you
can
think
did
not
state
the
cause
of
action.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
therefore,
i
was
expecting
starting
from
this
court,
that
to
say
that
it
does
state
a
cause
of
action
before
there
could
be
a
charge?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
who
are
the
experts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
this
connection,
now
that
we've
already
interrupted
you,
there
is
this
paramount
of
talk
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
about
title
8
of
the
â€˜68
act.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
allegation
whatsoever
in
the
complaint
about
title
8?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
it
considered
by
the
courts
below?
