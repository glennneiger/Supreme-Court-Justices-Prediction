is
that
--
does
that
occur
in
most
of
the
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
there
was
no
compliance
--
there
was
a
compliance
with
only
--
in
only
one
out
the
100,000
cases
or
a
thousand.
let's
assume
that
hardly
ever
they
complied.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
always
had
to
go
through
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
that
make
some
difference
to
you
as
to
what
should
happen
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
because
of
--
certainly
you
must
have
--
you
must
--
no
one
hardly
ever
upsets
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
successful
in
upsetting
one,

(k)
proceeding.
that
the
conclusion
of
the
10
(k)
proceeding,
there
is
a
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't
say
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
union
or
that
union
gets
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
you
need
a
probable
cause,
the
standard
as
to
whether
to
start
a
10
(k)
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't,
expand
its
preponderance,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
board
sits
down
to
decide
which
one
is
entitled
in
the
10
(k)
proceeding,
its
preponderance.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
be
the
same
reviewing
standards,
is
there
substantial
evidence
that
the
court
concludes?
