justice

well,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
about
that.
once
you
have
find
this
proceeding
subject
to
554,
can
you
think
of
any
reasonable
way
to
find
that
it
isn't
also
subject
to
556
and
may
require
a
decision
by
a
hearing
examiner?

in
itt
versus
local
134.
it
was
a
labor
relations
case
coming
out
of
the
seventh
circuit.
itt
charged
that
the
union
had
engaged
in
a
jurisdictional
strike
prohibited
by
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
by
striking
an
order
to
force
and
employer
to
assign
its
particular
work
rather
than
give
the
work
to
another
union.
pursuant
to
section
10
(k)
of
the
act,
the
board
determined
that
another
union
was
entitled
to
the
work.
and
only
after
respondent
refused
to
comply
that
determination
did
the
board
charge
respondent
with
an
unfair
labor
practice.
at
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding,
the
board
found
that
the
union
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
however
declined
to
enforce
the
board's
order
on
the
grounds
that
participation
by
a
board
attorney
in
both
the
10
(k)
and
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
proceedings
violated
section
5
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
circuits
on
this
point.
the
apa
section
at
issue
applies
only
in
cases
of
adjudication
as
that
term
is
defined
by
the
act.
the
board's
section
10
(k)
proceeding
however
is
not
such
an
adjudication
since
it
is
neither
itself
a
final
disposition
of
any
issue
nor
is
it
agency
process
for
the
formulation
of
an
order
as
that
term
is
defined
in
the
act.
standing
alone,
the
section
10
(k)
determination
is
not
binding
on
the
union
nor
does
it
order
a
union
to
do
anything.
the
focus
in
the
later
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
materially
different
in
the
proceedings
are
separate.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
