mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
murray
has
indicated,
a
10
(k)
hearing
which
this
court
had
occasioned
to
become
familiar
with
in
the
plasterer's
case
three
years
ago
is
not
an
adversary
or
accusatory
proceeding
like
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
its
purpose
is
not
to
determine
whether
an
unfair
labor
practice
has
been
committed
but
rather
to
obviate
the
need
for
such
a
determination
by
resolving
the
underlying
jurisdictional
dispute.
it
is
held
like
a
representation
case
hearing
not
before
an
administrative
law
judge
but
a
hearing
officer
who
is
an
employee
of
the
regional
office.
and
the
hearing
officer's
function
is
solely
to
develop
a
full
record
so
that
the
board
may
determine
which
of
two
competing
groups
is
entitled
to
claim
the
work
in
dispute.
the
evidentiary
material
relates
primarily
to
such
matters
as
the
employee's
skills,
area
employer
and
industry
practice,
collective
bargaining
agreements.
in
short,
the
type
of
economic
material
or
administrative
material
which
rarely
presents
credibility
issues
and
as
for
that
reason,
that
the
hearing
officer
doesn't
make
any
credibility
determinations.
the
close
of
the
hearing,
the
case
is
transmitted
to
the
board
for
a
decision.
the
hearing
officer
prepares
an
analysis
of
the
issues
but
does
not
as
i
say,
make
any
credibility
determinations.
he
makes
no
recommendations,
just
as
in
the
--
as
in
the
representation
proceeding,
procedure.
the
board
makes
its
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
record
developed
by
the
hearing
officer,
his
analysis
of
the
record
which
contains
no
recommendations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
can
be
oral
argument
before
the
board
if
the
board
chooses
to
grant
it.
now,
if
the
parties
comply
with
the
board's
10
(k)
determination,
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
is
dismissed.
you
never
get
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
it's
on
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
compliance?
compliance
happens
in
a
fair
percentage
of
the
cases.
i
wouldn't
say
that
its
most
but
it's
not
insignificant.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
statistics
that
we
have
given
and
they
indicate
that
the
time
between
notice
of
hearing
and
board
determination
in
a
10
(k)
proceeding
is
about
175
days.
mr.
norton
j.
come
none.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
would
not
make
any
difference
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
this
goes
to
the
question
that
justice
blackmun
asked
earlier.
when
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
proceeding
eventuates
if
one
does
eventuate,
the
issues
that
are
open
just
as
in
the
--
our
case,
the
10
(k)
determination
is
not
subject
to
relitigation
absent
newly
discovered
evidence.
so
that
the
--
as
a
practical
matter,
the
only
issue
that
is
open
is
the
--
whether
or
not
the
union
that
is
bringing
strike
pressure
and
loss
in
the
10
(k)
is
picketing
for
the
object
that
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
proscribes.
only
a
probable
cause
determination
is
made
at
the
10
(k)
stage,
you
have
the
typical
unfair
labor
practice
standard
of
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
it
has
to
be
sustained
in
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
if
the
union
is
able
to
show
that
in
fact
it
does
not
have
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
object
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
a
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there's
a
probable
cause
standard
only
on
whether
or
not
the
union
engaged
in
the
kind
of
a
strike
pressure
for
the
object
which
you
need
to
trigger
the
10
(k)
determination.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
you're
quite
right
that
in
terms
of
the
determination
of
who
is
entitled
to
the
work
that
is
not
put
in
probable
cause.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
but
the
board
does
that
on
the
basis
of
its
own
analysis
of
the
record
and
not
on
the
basis
of
any
recommendations
by
the
hearing
officer
but
it's
exactly
the
same
as
it
is
with
the
representation
case.
now,
when
the
--
if
the
board
should
issue
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
order,
the
losing
union
can
take
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
get
review
of
the
--
not
only
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
order
but
also
of
the
10
(k)
determination
and
he
may
be
able
to
get
the
10
(k)
determination
set
aside
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
just
happened
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
that
is
so.
but
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
we
have
an
adjudication
within
the
meaning
of
the
apa
and
the
problem
that
arises
is
that
--
i'm
referring
the
court
to
section
554
of
the
--
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
is
in
page
41
of
the
board's
brief,
the
gray
one
here.
it
says,
this
section
applies
according
to
the
provisions
thereof
in
every
case
of
adjudication
required
by
statute
to
be
determined
on
the
record
after
opportunity
for
an
agency
hearing
and
then
you
have
a
list
of
six
exceptions,
the
sixth
being
the
certification
of
worker
representatives.
now,
we
submit
that
a
10
(k)
determination
is
not
an
adjudication
within
the
meaning
of
554
and
if
it
isn't
within
554
then
the
--
everything
else
follows.
the
remaining
provisions
of
the
apa
are
not
applicable.
we
submit
that
it's
not
within
554
for
at
least
--
for
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
an
adjudication
because
an
adjudication
is
defined
as
“agency
process
for
the
formulation
of
an
order”
and
order
means
the
whole
or
part
of
a
final
disposition
of
an
agency
in
a
matter
other
than
rule
making.
and
we
submit
that
a
10
(k)
determination
is
not
a
final
disposition
of
the
matter
which
invoked
the
board's
processes.
the
matter
that
invoked
the
board's
processes
was
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
that
is
not
resolved
by
the
10
(k)
proceeding.
you
may
never
get
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
proceeding
at
the
--
at
least
you
don't
know
that
at
the
time
that
the
10
(k)
determination
is
made.
secondly,
we
submit
that
even
if
it
were
an
adjudication
within
the
meaning
of
the
apa,
it
is
not
an
adjudication
required
by
statute
to
be
determined
on
the
record
after
opportunity
for
an
agency
hearing.
although
the
statute
does
require
if
the
board
is
to
make
the
determination
that
it
shall
have
a
hearing.
it
does
not
go
on
and
specify
the
nature
of
that
hearing
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
florida
railway
case
and
allegheny-ludlum
which
was
cited
in
our
brief,
the
court
has
made
plain
that
congress
was
using
the
term
to
determine
on
the
record
after
opportunity
for
a
hearing
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
screening
out
of
those
situations
where
there
was
a
hearing
requirement
but
not
a
formal
hearing
requirement
and
i
might
say
that
a
board
hearing
is
only
an
alternative
if
the
parties
are
unable
by
some
private
means
of
adjustment
to
work
out
the
jurisdictional
dispute
and
certainly
that
doesn't
have
to
be
a
record
type
hearing.
and
thirdly,
we
say
that
if
we
fail
on
those
two
counts,
we
believe
that
we
--
it
is
possible
to
read
the
10
(k)
proceeding
as
falling
within
the
--
our
case
exception
six
certification
of
worker
representatives.
now,
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
a
term
of
art
however,
it
occurred
to
me
on
looking
over
the
statute
the
other
evening
and
i
know
that
arguments
thought
of
on
the
eve
on
an
argument,
i
suspect,
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
there
is
an
unless
clause
in
there
that
proscribes
forcing
or
requiring
an
assignment
of
work
and
so
on
unless
such
employer
is
failing
to
conform
to
an
order
or
a
certification
of
the
board
determining
the
bargaining
representative
for
employees
performing
such
work
and
the
board
has
interpreted
that
and
this
court
notes
that
in
a
footnote
in
plasterer's
as
permitting
it
to
dismiss
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
where
it
runs
in
favor
of
the
striking
union
and
the
employer
has
not
complied
with
it,
so
i
think
that
this
unless
clause
gives
some
support
to
what
i
would
concede,
what
otherwise
be
a
strange
reading.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
i
would
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
our
best
argument
is
the
prior
to
that
i've
made
and
i
might
just
say
before
i
sit
down
that
this
has
been
a
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
the
board
that
there
was
enunciated
shortly
after
10
(k)
was
added
to
the
act
in
1949
and
it
was
consistently
been
repeated
by
the
board.
so
we
do
not
have
a
case
here
with
the
board
changing
its
position.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
right,
right.
