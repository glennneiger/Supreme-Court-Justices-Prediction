mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
the
prepared
part
of
my
argument,
i
must
point
out
that
we
do
disagree
with
mr.
come
that
the
10
(k)
hearing
is
the
same
as
the
representation
case
hearing
and
i
should
initially
note
that
these
two
types
of
hearings
are
differentiated
by
the
fact
that
one
is
provided
for
in
section
9
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
handling
representation
matters
and
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
provided
for
in
section
10
of
the
statute
having
to
do
with
unfair
labor
practice
matters
primarily.
i
think
mr.
come
has
--
excuse
me,
correctly
noted
that
the
primary
issue
before
the
court
based
upon
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
which
states
very
clearly
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
particularly
section
554
does
apply
to
the
labor
board's
10
(k)
hearings.
he
has
noted
correctly
that
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
board's
10
(k)
hearing
is
an
adjudication
within
the
meaning
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
think
necessarily,
we
must
then
look
at
and
analyze
the
two
statutes
themselves
as
well
as
the
related
sections
of
both
of
those
statutes.
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
did
i
--
your
quote
was
--
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
labor
board
admits
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
well,
that
was
our
basic
contention
and
--
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
i
think
that
the
court,
as
i
read
its
decisions
said
that
it
assumed
that
the
board
would
follow
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
based
primarily
upon
the
rationale
of
the
one
--
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
believe
it
was
ever
admitted
on
the
record,
your
honor.
you
are
correct
in
that.
but
i
think
that
the
basic
question
or
554
does
in
reality
apply
to
the
10
(k)
hearings
particularly
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
plasterer's
case
must
be
viewed
in
light
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
designed
to
do.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted
and
was
explained
very
fully
in
the
wong
case,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
to
set
down
the
outer
limits
within
which
the
administrative
agencies
could
operate
and
particularly
to
prevent
the
commingling
of
functions
particularly
the
prosecutorial
function
with
the
adjudicative
function.
and
in
so,
setting
out
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
section
554
was
specifically
designed
and
in
its
subsection
d
in
the
second
paragraph
specifically
prevented
commingling
of
these
functions.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
no
exception
to
be
granted
to
the
labor
board
in
its
10
(k)
hearings
from
the
application
of
section
554
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
indeed
i
might
note
that
in
the
labor
management
relations
act,
congress
has
stated
that
the
labor
board
in
the
performance
of
its
functions
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
must
provide
and
follow
rules
in
conformity
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
that
may
be
the
source
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
judge
morrow's
comment
about,
it
is
conceded
that
554
applies.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
if
we
look
at
section
551,
as
well
as,
section
554,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
the
10
(k)
hearing
is
an
adjudication
within
the
meaning
of
section
554
is
a
valid
conclusion
and
further
that
no
exception
lies
particularly
because
the
10
(k)
hearing
is
not
the
same
as
a
representation
case.
i
think
that
the
language
of
551
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
has
been
passed
upon
numerous
times
by
this
court.
we
cited
the
wyman-gordon
case
in
which
this
court
said
through
mr.
justice
black
that
a
representation
case
meets
the
criteria
of
section
551
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
rationale
has
been
affirmed
by
this
court
as
late
as
mr.
justice
powell's
decision
in
the
bell
aerospace
case
and
as
i
believed
referred
to
also
in
other
decisions
including
florida
east
coast.
so
that
it's
clear
that
the
labor
board
proceedings
are
within
the
ambit
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
adjudications
particularly
under
section
551.
then
the
critical
question
becomes,
is
there
anything
in
section
554
that
would
take
the
labor
board
proceedings,
particularly
the
10
(k)
proceedings
out
from
under
the
application
of
section
554
and
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
found
and
correctly
found
that
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
a
part
of
the
agency
review
which
becomes
the
final
part
of
the
board
order.
as
mr.
justice
white
clearly
analyzed
in
the
plasterer's
case,
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
an
integral
part
of
the
procedure
which
the
board
has
provided
within
the
ambit
of
section
10
of
the
statute.
in
other
words,
section
10
of
the
statute
provides
that
the
labor
board
can
pursue
the
unfair
labor
practice
matters
and
under
section
10
(k)
specifically
can
hear
and
should
hear
and
determine
unfair
labor
practice
matters
that
are
in
the
jurisdiction
dispute
area
and
should
decide
and
award
the
work
in
question
to
one
of
the
two
competing
unions.
this
rationale
of
the
plasterer's
case
of
course
picked
up
and
adopted
the
cbs
decision
in
which
the
board
was
admonished
to
make
a
determination
in
jurisdictional
dispute
matters
and
under
section
10
(k)
to
award
the
work
to
one
of
the
competing
unions.
but
i
think
that
when
we
look
at
the
plasterer's
decision,
we
have
to
see
if
there's
anything
in
there,
in
that
decision
which
would
make
the
10
(k)
proceedings
other
than
an
integral
part
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
the
court
of
appeals
where
justice
morrow
found
that
this
was
an
integral
part
of
the
board's
final
order
which
is
the
unfair
labor
practice
decision
in
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
case.
i
submit
that
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law
and
that
the
plasterer's'
analysis
of
the
labor
board
procedure
fully
warrants
the
application
on
--
of
the
principle
that
the
administrative
procedure
act,
section
554
must
apply.
now,
the
board
as
i
said
earlier
takes
a
position
that
the
representation
case
is
the
same
as
the
10
(k)
hearing.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
the
same
proceedings
because
the
object
of
the
two
hearings
is
entirely
different.
in
the
representation
case
section
9
of
the
statute
gives
the
board
authority
to
direct
--
to
conduct
elections
and
in
the
course
of
that
authority
to
conduct
elections
has
the
right
to
hold
hearings
in
which
to
determine
the
correct
and
appropriate
bargaining
unit
which
should
be
the
subject
of
the
election.
however,
in
section
10
(k)
of
the
--
excuse
me,
in
section
10
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
an
entirely
different
problem
is
approached
that
of
unfair
labor
practices.
an
integral
part
of
section
10
is
the
10
(k)
proceeding
by
which
congress
said
to
the
labor
board,
you
may
hear
rather
than
may,
you
must
hear
and
determine
the
jurisdictional
dispute
which
underlies
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
so
that
when
the
board
decides
the
10
(k)
aspect,
the
jurisdictional
question,
that
decision
is
and
of
course
it
is
termed
a
decision
and
determination
of
dispute.
that
decision
is
then
picked
up
and
absorbed
into
the
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
should
there
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
hearing
on
the
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
question.
so
that
within
the
definition
section
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
section
551,
clearly
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
a
part
of
the
final
order
which
the
board
does
come
down
with
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
matters.
so
in
other
words,
we
have
an
absorption
of
the
10
(k)
decision
into
the
unfair
labor
practice
decision
and
under
the
board's
own
rules,
we
find
that
the
10
(k)
matter
is
an
integral
part
of
the
final
order
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
matter.
2so,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
when
it
found
that
section
554
does
apply
because
--
to
the
10
(k)
hearings
because
the
10
(k)
hearing
is
a
part
of
the
agency
process
leading
to
its
final
order.
the
arguments
presented
primarily
in
the
briefs
by
the
labor
board
and
itt
is
that
the
detrimental
effects
will
flow
from
affirming
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
submit
that
these
arguments
as
to
detrimental
effect
are
not
valid.
the
first
and
basic
argument
is
that
there
will
be
a
necessity
for
judicial
review
of
section
10
(k)
determinations
if
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
is
affirmed.
in
other
words,
if
the
10
(k)
decision
is
found
to
be
an
adjudication
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
necessarily,
judicial
review
must
follow.
we
submit
that
this
conclusion
is
not
warranted
and
that
the
seventh
circuit
recognized
clearly
that
the
10
(k)
proceeding
is
only
the
first
step
leading
to
the
final
order
of
the
labor
board
which
is
the
ultimate
unfair
labor
practice
determination.
so
that
the
board's
own
rules
and
regulations
proscribed
what
is
a
final
and
therefore
reviewable
order
under
the
provisions
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
in
other
words,
section
10
(e)
and
(f)
gave
to
the
labor
board
at
the
--
excuse
me,
under
section
10
(f)
gave
to
a
party
aggrieved
the
privilege
of
appealing
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
a
final
order.
likewise
in
section
10
(e),
a
labor
board
may
petition
for
enforcement.
the
question
of
what
is
a
final
order
within
the
ambit
of
section
10
(f)
was
left
to
the
board
because
that
section
is
silent
as
to
the
definition
of
a
final
order.
therefore,
under
the
basic
concept
and
principle
that
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
must
be
followed
by
any
litigant
before
an
administrative
agency,
local
134
and
any
other
litigant
before
the
labor
board
must
look
at
and
follow
the
labor
board's
rules
if
they
are
not
overruled
by
higher
authority,
particularly
this
court.
there
has
been
no
decision
by
this
court
that
the
section
10
(k)
hearing
is
a
final
and
appealable
order
of
the
labor
board
and
i
think
in
reading
the
plasterer's
case,
we
see
rather
clearly
that
the
two-step
procedure,
in
other
words,
the
unfair
labor
--
the
10
(k)
hearing
and
the
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
hearing
and
decision
are
really
two
parts
of
one
process
designed
and
certainly
a
clear
part
of
the
scheme
that
section
10
of
the
statute
sets
out.
the
labor
board
itself
has
determined
that
no
appeal
shall
be,
had
from
any
10
(k)
determination.
now,
the
decision
in
the
shell
case
was
cited
to
this
court,
if
i
might
point
out
that
case
presents
an
entirely
different
question
because
in
that
case
the
labor
board
dismissed
the
10
(k)
notice
of
hearing
or
in
other
words,
said,
we
are
finding
--
we
are
making
no
decision
and
finding
no
basis
for
awarding
the
work
to
either
the
competing
unions.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
shell
case
concluded
that
this
was
not
a
final
order
and
therefore
was
not
reviewable
under
section
10
of
the
statute.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
is
exactly
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
waterways
terminal
case
where
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
dismissal
of
a
10
(k)
notice
of
hearing
is
in
fact
a
final
order
and
therefore
an
appealable
order
from
the
labor
board.
i
should
note
also
for
the
court
that
there
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
filed
in
the
shell
case,
so
that
that
issue
may
be
presented
to
this
court
or
is
presented
to
the
court
and
maybe
ruled
upon
later.
now,
the
second
area
that
has
been
argued
as
the
basis
for
overturning
the
seventh
circuit
decision
is
that
necessarily,
an
administrative
law
judge
will
have
to
be
appointed
to
hear
the
section
10
(k)
hearings
if
the
seventh
circuit
decision
holding
that
the
10
(k)
hearing
is
an
adjudication
is
allowed
to
stand.
we
submit
and
have
argued
in
part
four
of
our
brief
that
this
conclusion
does
not
necessarily
follow.
there
are
number
of
reasons
why
that
conclusion
does
not
follow.
initially,
the
argument
was
made
by
local
134
to
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
section
556
and
557
which
proscribe
and
require
or
prescribe
and
require
the
administrative
law
judge
be
appointed
should
apply
to
this
case.
shortly
prior
to
the
argument
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
decided
the
bricklayers
case.
on
the
bricklayers
case,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
10
(k)
hearings
need
not
have
an
administrative
law
judge
appointed
to
hear
those
matters.
the
seventh
circuit
though
interestingly
enough
did
not
rule
upon
the
contention
of
local
134
that
an
administrative
law
judge
must
be
appointed
to
hear
10
(k)
matters.
so
that
we
have
in
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
no
finding,
no
order
that
the
administrative
law
judge
be
appointed.
on
that
basis,
we
feel
that
by
affirming
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit,
there
is
no
requirement
placed
upon
the
board
that
it
holds
its
future
10
(k)
hearings
by
appointing
an
administrative
law
judge.
secondly,
we
submit
that
section
554
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
divisible
and
not
necessarily
an
integral
part
of
sections
556
and
557.
in
other
words,
the
nature
of
those
various
sections
is
sufficiently
different
so
that
they
need
not
be
considered
as
one
complete
entity.
there
is
reference
in
section
554
as
in
section
553,
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
the
hearing
requirements
of
section
556
and
557.
however,
in
section
--
subsection
(d),
particularly
the
second
paragraph
which
prohibits
the
commingling
of
functions,
there
is
no
reference
to
section
556.
there
is
a
--
i
want
to
submit
an
oblique
reference
to
section
557
but
it
is
our
position
that
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
from
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
that
section
556
and
section
557
must
apply
to
all
labor
board
10
(k)
hearings.
i
believe
that
this
court's
opinion
through
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
florida
east
coast
railway
case
recognizes
the
general
principle
that
and
in
that
case
it
was
section
553
of
the
statute,
the
rule
making
section.
the
principle
was
recognized
that
it's
not
necessarily
correct
or
true
that
sections
556
and
557
must
apply
when
the
provisions
of
section
553
apply
to
--
in
administrative
agencies
hearing.
we
submit
likewise
that
it
is
not
necessarily
true
particularly
under
the
posture
of
the
case
that
has
come
up
to
this
court
from
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
nature
of
the
decision
that
sections
556
and
557
must
be
applied
to
the
labor
board's
10
(k)
hearings.
i
think
that
in
this
regard
also,
we
should
notice
and
note
the
fact
that
the
labor
board
itself
by
its
own
rules
has
held
and
or
we
should
say
has
promulgated
the
rule
that
in
10
(k)
hearings,
administrative
law
judges
need
not
be
appointed
and
as
we
argue
in
our
brief
at
greater
detail,
we
believe
that
the
principle
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
applies
here
also,
that
in
other
words,
as
long
as
the
labor
board's
rule
is
not
in
and
of
itself
violative
of
some
other
provision
of
the
federal
statute
such
as
the
commingling
of
functions.
but
as
long
as
there
is
no
apparent,
obvious
violation
of
the
federal
statutes,
then
the
labor
board's
rules
must
be
followed
and
we
must
as
any
litigant
before
the
agency
must
exhaust
the
remedies,
must
follow
the
rules
proscribed
by
that
agency
for
the
respective
type
of
matter
that
comes
before
the
agency.
in
this
case,
the
labor
board
says
through
its
rules
that
the
10
(k)
hearing
will
be
heard
not
by
an
administrative
law
judge
but
rather
by
one
of
its
other
employees.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
seventh
circuit
decision
and
the
labor
board's
rules
as
they
now
stand
which
do
not
require
the
administrative
law
judge.
finally,
i
think
that
the
argument
that
the
board
has
made
in
its
brief
that
the
--
and
as
mr.
come
has
noted
here
today
that
it
has
consistently
followed
the
practice
set
out
in
its
rule
of
appointing
one
of
its
employees
other
than
an
administrative
law
judge
to
hear
the
section
10
(k)
hearings.
and
that
this
is
as
mr.
come
said,
entitled
to
great
weight
and
if
there
is
no
change
in
policy,
i
think,
it
should
not
be
given
as
much
deference
as
mr.
come
would
have
it
because
this
court
in
the
cbs
case
had
noted
to
the
board
that
for
many
years,
it
had
consistently
--
the
labor
board
that
is,
had
consistently
not
decided
which
of
the
two
competing
unions
in
section
10
(k)
hearings
would
be
entitled
to
do
the
work
in
question.
and
in
the
cbs
case,
this
court
very
clearly
said
to
the
labor
board,
“you
have
not
been
doing
the
function
which
congress
has
said
you
must
perform
here,
that
is
decide
and
award
the
work.”
so
that
the
fact
that
the
labor
board
has
proceeded
in
this
manner
for
many
years
while
it
--
is
of
some
weight,
i
think
is
not
a
persuasive
weight
and
i
may
point
to
the
court
this.
the
board
has
never
contended
that
it
consistently
or
even
in
any
case
has
had
the
same
employee
performing
the
function
of
hearing
the
10
(k)
jurisdictional
dispute
matter
and
then
serving
as
prosecutor
in
the
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
matter.
in
other
words,
as
the
board's
brief
sets
out
rather
clearly,
this
is
a
rare
if
ever
occurrence.
i
think
that
leads
us
to
the
--
to
our
final
argument
that
there
is
really
no
injury
or
harm
to
the
labor
board
by
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
the
board
is
required
under
the
seventh
circuit
decision
to
not
commingle
prosecutorial
with
adjudicative
functions
and
specifically
is
prevented
from
appointing
the
same
employee
to
the
role
of
hearing
officer
in
a
10
(k)
hearing
as
it
has
performed
the
prosecutorial
role
in
the
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
case.
the
labor
board
--
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
i
think
the
prejudice
in
this
case,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
that
at
the
10
(k)
hearing,
the
administrative
--
excuse
me,
the
employee
who
was
the
hearing
officer
made
rulings
on
evidence.
one
of
his
basic
rulings
was
that
the
union
was
not
entitled
to
pursue
evidence
by
means
of
a
subpoena
as
to
the
execution
of
the
original
contract
between
the
company
and
the
other
union
in
this
case.
and
consequently,
the
local
134
was
precluded
from
presenting
evidence
in
support
of
one
of
its
major
contentions,
namely,
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
company
and
the
other
union
was
not
valid.
now,
this
ruling
made
by
the
hearing
officer
was
unfortunately
of
such
magnitude
that
it
not
only
took
away
one
of
our
major
contentions
but
then
when
the
labor
board
decided
the
determination
of
the
dispute,
the
labor
board's
primary
criteria
was
that
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
other
union.
now,
we
submit
that
the
labor
board's
reliance
upon
that
contract
after
precluding
our
seeking
evidence
which
as
part
of
our
position
was
that
the
contract
was
not
valid,
took
away
a
very
substantial
part
of
our
argument.
and
i
might
note
that
one
of
the
questions
although
not
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit
but
which
we
argued
to
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
there
was
--
there
is
a
clear
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit,
the
dayton
motel's
case
which
holds
that
the
labor
board
should
not
close
its
eyes
to
relevant
evidence
merely
because
it
may
be
beyond
the
labor
board's
time
period
of
the
six-month
section
10
(b)
requirement.
so,
i
think
we
were
substantial
in
--
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
it
may
well
have
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
subsequently
the
same
man
who
made
the
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
then
prosecuted
the
case
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
hearing
and
of
course
part
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
hearing
was
the
validity
of
the
labor
board's
determination
of
the
dispute
that
this
commingled
the
two
hearings
and
the
commingling
of
the
functions
i
suppose
is
more
appropriate
way
to
state
it
was
psychologically
improper
and
the
seventh
circuit
i
think,
the
number,
the
basis
of
its
decision
was
that
the
intent
of
section
554
is
to
prevent
this
psychological
dilemma
to
be
presented
to
administrative
agency
employees.
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
our
basic
position
is
that
we
should
have
been
allowed
to
pursue
that
evidence
and
to
present
our
full
case
in
the
10
(k)
hearing
but
we
were
prevented
from
doing
that
and
i
--
as
i
understand,
the
seventh
circuit
decision
that
is
the
basis
and
the
exact
application
of
the
wong
case
that
the
court
found
applicable
to
the
10
(k)
hearings.
i
think
the
significant
part
of
the
seventh
circuit
decision
is
that
it
picked
up
and
applied
the
rationale
of
the
wong
case
to
the
board's
10
(k)
hearing.
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
i
think
the
court
well
recognized
that
this
was
the
board's
primary
contention.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
recognized
this.
this
was
the
board's
primary
contention
and
found
the
psychological
prohibitions
which
the
wong
case
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
section
554
set
out
to
be
persuasive
and
i
submit
that
they
are
--
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
well,
i
think
our
basic
position
there
is
that
the
language
of
section
554
particularly
in
section
d
sub
--
paragraph
two
which
is
the
exact
language
which
prevents
the
commingling
of
functions
makes
no
reference
to
section
556.
as
i
say,
there
is
an
oblique
reference
to
section
557
but
we
submit
that
that
language
of
section
554
(d)
--
subparagraph
(d)
second
paragraph
is
divisible.
in
other
words,
it
talks
about,
there
shall
be
no
commingling
of
functions
between
--
in
play
engaged
in
the
prosecutorial
or
investigative
functions
with
the
decision
making
functions
but
it
divides
the
decision
making
into
three
different
categories:
decision,
recommended
decision
which
i
submit
would
be
a
section
556
type
of
--
more
appropriate
than
a
section
556
type
of
decision
and
agency
process
under
section
557.
we
believe
that
those
are
divisible
and
as
we
understand
the
labor
board
rule,
this
is
a
decision
of
the
board,
a
decision
and
determination
of
election
and
therefore
it
falls
within
the
decision
category
and
we
think
that
these
are
divisible.
mr.
robert
e.
fitzgerald,
jr.
well,
i
submit
that
the
--
our
position
is
that
these
are
divisible
because
subsection
(c)
and
subsection
(d)
provide
for
different
types
of
or
prevent
the
agency
from
engaging
in
different
types
of
functions.
now,
the
--
that
appears
to
have
been
the
construction
that
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
gave
to
the
10
(k)
proceeding
in
this
case
because
it
did
not
come
down
with
any
decision
to
the
effect
that
administrative
law
judges
must
be
assigned
in
the
section
10
(k)
hearings.
thank
you.
