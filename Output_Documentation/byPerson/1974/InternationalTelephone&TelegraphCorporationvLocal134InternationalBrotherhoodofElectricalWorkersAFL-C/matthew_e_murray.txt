mr.
matthew
e.
murray
honorable
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
i
have
agreed
to
divide
my
time
with
mr.
come
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
i
felt
that
the
court
would
like
to
hear
from
the
agency
itself
as
to
how
the
--
it
has
been
interpreting
the
question
which
is
before
us
today
and
that
is
the
applicability
of
sections
554
and
the
following
sections
to
the
10
(k)
hearing
process
in
the
labor
management
relations
act.
the
facts
to
this
case
commenced
in
elk
grove
village,
a
little
town
at
the
edge
of
cook
county
which
includes
the
greater
chicago
area
and
the
municipality
at
--
in
elk
grove
had
given
itt
a
contract
to
install
all
its
communication
equipment
in
the
new
municipal
building.
the
local
134
of
the
ibew
had
been
doing
practically
all
installation
of
telephone
equipment
in
cook
county
for
many
years
and
considered
this
particular
area
their
private
reserve.
so
a
strike
took
place.
ibew
was
out
there
pulling
cable
and
they
found
out
that
the
itt
employees
who
were
represented
by
nationwide
agreement
by
the
communication
workers
of
america
were
going
to
do
the
installation
and
they
struck
the
job.
we
filed
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
and
after
the
use
of
a
ten-day
period
in
which
the
board
tries
to
get
the
parties
to
settle
a
dispute,
the
matter,
the
complaint
issued
and
the
hearing
officer
was
appointed,
the
facts
were
gathered.
everyone
introduced
their
evidence
including
the
employers
and
the
unions
and
the
10
(k)
was
adjudged
by
the
court
to
--
was
adjudged
proper
that
the
communication
workers
employed
by
itt
be
given
this
work.
the
other
party
at
that
point
has
ten
minutes
or
ten
days
rather
to
tell
the
regional
director
if
they're
going
to
abide
by
this
decision.
ten-day
period
elapsed
and
they
informed
the
regional
director
that
they
did
not
intend
to
abide
by
the
ruling
of
the
board
in
the
10
(k)
proceeding
which
of
course
gave
rise
to
the
immediate
filing
of
an
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
charge
under
section
10
(b)
and
(c)
of
the
act.
the
10
(b)
charge
of
course
is
a
prosecutorial
proceeding
by
the
board
as
opposed
to
a
purely
investigative
proceeding
under
10
(k)
and
therefore,
the
board
needs
the
general
counsel
must
have
a
prosecutor.
and
the
hearing
officer
in
the
10
(k)
proceeding
whose
duty
--
it
was
merely
to
gather
evidence
and
submit
the
record
to
the
board
without
recommendation,
was
appointed
as
prosecutor
in
the
10
(b)
and
(c)
unfair
labor
practice
case.
now
the
seventh
circuit,
there
was
no
objection
made
to
this
until
the
proceedings
were
concluded
and
at
that
point,
ibew
in
its
brief
complained
that
the
same
man
who
had
sat
in
the
10
(k)
proceeding
and
heard
the
evidence
was
commingling
prosecutorial
with
judicial
functions
in
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
now,
the
court
both
in
--
the
board
of
course
overruled
this
contention,
went
up
to
the
seventh
circuit,
they
found
that
indeed,
ibew
was
guilty
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
without
question
that
this
is
precisely
what
the
section
had
been
enacted
to
prevent
but
they
finally
said
that
they
would
not
enforce
the
order
because
they
felt
that
15
or
10
(k)
was
subject
to
554
etcetera
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
there
was
an
illegal
commingling
of
judicial
and
investigative
functions,
i
mean,
prosecutorial
investigative
functions
which
that
act
forbids.
now
of
course,
mr.
come
i
think
will
concentrate
generally
on
how
the
board
has
treated
10
(k)
with
reference
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
over
a
long
period
of
time.
we're
all
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
board
has
always
treated
10
(k)
as
not
subject
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
in
a
series
of
cases,
it's
so
held
that
these
--
this
was
never
challenged
by
congress
or
the
courts
for
a
period
of
25
years.
we
know
also
that
the
board
has
--
mr.
matthew
e.
murray
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
in
the
record
for
that
statement
of
judge
morrow's.
it's
a
completely
false
assumption.
it
was
contented
by
the
attorneys
for
local
134
but
there
was
never
any
admission
of
any
kind.
so,
this
is
the
key
to
this
case.
judge
morrow
did
not
cite
any
authority
or
any
--
make
any
reference
to
the
record
in
support
of
this
observation
simply
because
it
was
not
fair.
now,
in
making
this
unwarranted
observation
and
assumption,
in
addition
to
ignoring
everything
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
done
on
this
--
in
this
matter,
the
u.s.
courts
of
appeal
have
had
a
case
when
they
examined
this.
the
most
recent
decision,
well,
the
second
most
recent
decision
was
the
d.c.
circuit
in
bricklayers
and
in
that
case,
judge
feess
flatly
holds
that
10
(k)
proceedings
are
not
applicable
to
the
administrative
procedure.
and
in
that
case,
the
issue
was
whether
trial
examiners
should
be
used
instead
of
hearing
officers
and
there's
quite
a
distinction
between
a
hearing
officer
and
a
trial
examiner.
judge
morrow
sees
to
--
sees
fit
to
use
the
word
interchangeably
but
they
are
quite
different
--
sorts
of
animals.
a
hearing
officer
is
forbidden
by
board
regulation
for
making
any
recommendation.
its
sole
function
is
investigatory.
whereas
it
is
incumbent
and
is
required
by
a
hearing
--
an
administrative
law
judge
or
a
trial
examiner
that
he
make
a
recommended
decision.
mr.
matthew
e.
murray
no
he
is
not.
he
was
simply
an
employee
of
the
thirteenth
region
and
he
sat
and
heard
the
case,
sent
the
record
to
the
board.
that
was
his
sole
function.
he
did
make
evidentiary
rulings
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
were
any
improper
evidentiary
rulings
either
in
the
board
decisions
or
the
seventh
circuit
decision.
so,
that
particular
thing,
the
prejudice
is
not
apparent.
if
there
was
any,
it's
certainly
is
not
apparent
from
the
record
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
now,
there
was
also
a
very
recent
case
down
the
fifth
circuit,
shell
chemical
which
is
cited
in
the
board's
brief
which
was
actually
decided
after
our
brief
was
filed
which
support
bricklayers
in
every
respect
in
this
particular
question.
and
of
course
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
and
to
discuss
this
problem.
but
mr.
justice
white
in
the
plasterer's
case
discussed
the
nature
of
10
(k)
and
he
emphasized
the
fact
that
no
one
is
bound
by
a
10
(k)
decision,
not
either
of
the
unions
nor
the
employers.
of
course,
the
judge
did
say
further
that
the
10
(k)
determination
of
the
board
which
requires
incidentally
a
different
modicum
of
proof
than
the
regular
unfair
labor
practice
case
that
it
nevertheless
had
a
very
strong
effect
on
the
10
(b)
and
(c)
case
which
followed
on
the
8
(b)
(4).
mr.
matthew
e.
murray
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor
but
i
think
perhaps
mr.
come
would
have
more
information
on
that
subject
than
do
i.
what
the
--
the
most
important
area
here
is
the
practical
results
that
would
ensue
if
the
10
(k)
determination
were
to
be
held
to
be
in
adjudication
under
section
554.
this
would
require
indeed
that
you
have
administrative
law
judges
rather
than
hearing
officers.
we
would
have
to
await
the
appointment
of
an
administrative
law
judge.
now,
we
must
not
forget
that
the
passage
of
10
(k)
by
congress
was
to
expedite
the
settling
of
jurisdictional
disputes.
mr.
matthew
e.
murray
as
was
saying
at
the
recess,
the
--
there
was
unanimous
opinion
practically
in
this
contrary,
for
the
need
for
the
legislation
to
quickly
settle
jurisdictional
strikes.
congress
was
very
much
in
the
mood
and
it's
certainly
was
their
intent,
the
unions
wanted
it,
the
employers
wanted
it
and
even
president
truman
sent
a
special
message
regarding
this
legislation.
but
unfortunately,
it
hasn't
worked
out
as
well
as
it
was
hoped.
however,
if
this
decision
is
allowed
to
stand,
we
might
suggest
that
it's
been
in
litigation
for
four
years
at
this
point
and
the
jurisdictional
dispute
is
still
not
settled.
the
board
has
furnished
us
with
statistics
showing
that
even
to
--
if
you
had
an
8
(b)
(2)
or
(3)
--
(2)
and
(3)
case
with
a
trial
examiner
which
would
be
required
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
the
average
time
elapsed
before
the
final
board
order
is
374
days.
so,
obviously,
this
is
going
to
completely
for
a
congressional
intent
if
this
decision
is
allowed
to
stand.
the
statute
will
have
to
be
amended,
something
will
have
to
be
done.
but
the
fact
is,
as
many
of
this
8
(b)
(2)'s
and
8
(b)
(3)'s
as
i've
participated
in,
i
have
never
seen
one
that
ended
inside
a
two
years
including
the
appeal
to
the
circuit
court.
you
have
submitted
findings
of
fact,
inclusions
of
law,
briefs,
exceptions,
briefs,
motion
for
reconsideration,
more
briefs,
lots
of
time
to
appeal
to
the
appellate
court
and
more
briefs
and
oral
arguments
and
motions
for
rehearing
with
more
briefs
and
it
is
simply
not
--
it
cannot
be
an
expeditious
way
of
settling
this
very
real
problem
which
causes
so
much
havoc
in
the
industry.
and
the
wording
of
the
statute
does
not
justify
it.
the
--
we're
warned
in
the
early
stages
of
the
act
that
the
definitions
are
not
to
be
taken
too
seriously
as
defining
the
scope
of
the
act
that
there
maybe
a
number
of
exceptions.
also,
in
554
proper,
we
have
the
exception
that
it
does
not
apply
to
a
certification
of
work
or
representatives
which
really
in
the
last
analysis
is
what
10
(k)
amounts
to.
it
--
in
the
case
of
9
(c)
proceeding,
they
are
certifying
workers
for
a
particular
plan
or
particular
unit.
in
a
10
(k)
proceeding,
they
are
certifying
workers
for
a
particular
type
of
work
and
it's
by
enlarged,
it's
the
same,
same
thing,
both
proceedings
conducted
by
hearing
officers
without
recommendation
to
the
board
merely
vehicles
to
elicit
evidence
and
transport
the
record
to
the
board.
we
therefore
submit
that
this
unwarranted
assumption,
completely
unwarranted
assumption
of
judge
morrow
that
the
act
is
applicable
should
be
disregarded
because
there's
nothing
in
the
act,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
justify
it.
now,
furthermore
and
lastly,
no
prejudice
could
have
resulted
it
here
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
young
wong
sung
or
i
don't
recall
the
exact
wording
of
that
case
where
you
have
a
prosecutor
building
a
case
and
then
sitting
in
judgment
on
it.
here,
this
hearing
officer
could
not
possibly
know.
again,
contrary
to
one
of
judge
morrow's
assumptions,
he
could
not
know
to
whom
the
work
would
be
awarded
by
the
board
or
whether
they're
in
fact
would
be
a
10
(b)
(4)
or
a
10
(4)
--
10
(b)
(4)
(d)
file.
he
couldn't
know
that,
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
would
be
the
prosecutor
and
there's
just
nothing
to
justify
any
exception
to
the
procedures
that
were
taken
in
this
particular
case.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
patience
your
honors.
