that
isn't
entirely
true
here
though
is
it?
i
mean,
mr.
adams
was
able
to
make
an
opening
statement
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
and
he
argued
at
the
close
of
the
state's
evidence,
the
inferences
he
thought
should
be
drawn
and
urging
the
dismissal
of
the
various
counts.
it
was
just
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
that
he
wasn't
allow
to
argue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
much
rapport
are
you
going
to
have
it?
if
the
judge
says
i
don't
like
the
hear
summation.
that's
not
my
custom
to
hear
him
and
the
lawyer
says,
well
the
law
requires
you
to
hear
him,
so
i'm
going
to
go
ahead
and
give
one
anyway?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
adams
really
didn't
press
his
point
very
much,
it
strikes
me
from
reading
page
92
of
the
transcript.
he
says
“well,
can
i
be
heard
somewhat
on
the
facts?
”
and
then
the
judge
says
“under
the
new
statute,
summation
is
discretionary,
and
i
choose
not
to
hear
summations.
”
that
he
didn't
go
on
and
say
“well,
even
if
you
don't
want
to
hear
summations,
i
insist
i
have
a
right
to
make
one.
”
he
seems
to
kind
of
accept
the
judge's
determination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
he'd
been
listening
to
counsel
for
several
days
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
even
though
a
judge
is
satisfied
from
hearing
counsel
over
this
period
of
time
that
counsel
couldn't
materially
assist
him
in
reaching
a
just
decision
on
the
facts,
nonetheless,
he's
got
to
hear
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
there
you
need
a
transcript
don't
you
if
you're
going
to
brief
the
facts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
daily
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
sometime
when
he
lapse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
a
court
reporter,
you
could
get
a
transcript
in
several
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
this
suggestion
for
briefing
on
the
factual
issues
in
a
non-jury
criminal
case
usually
come
about?
is
it
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
defendant
or
of
the
people
or
is
it
at
the
request
of
the
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
when
it
freshest
in
the
judge's
mind
is
right
after
