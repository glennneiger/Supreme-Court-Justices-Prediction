are
you
saying
that
there's
no
right
of
review
under
the
new
york
system
as
a
matter
of
discretion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
reviewable?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
made
his
record?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
i
go
back
to
while
this
maybe
repetitious
and
the
chief
justice
may
have
asked
it,
but
if
there
is
a
right
to
summation,
is
there
a
right
to
a
minimum
time
to
summarize?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
there
is
a
standard
of
discretionary
review
then,
so
long
as
there
is
some
time
granted,
but
not

justice

ms.
steele,
is
this
the
only
kind
of
case
in
the
new
york
system
where
a
statute
provides
for
absence
of
a
right
to
summarize?
on
the
civil
side,
there
is
right
to
summarize,
is
there
a
statutory
right?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
there
were
a
statute
from
the
civil
side
similar
to
the
one
under
attack
here.
would
your
case
be
any
different?
or
are
you
here
because
it's
only
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
morse,
assure
me
as
to
one
thing.
i
think
opposing
counsel
indicated
that
the
case
was
reviewable
in
the
state
structure
on
a
basis
of
abuse
of
discretion,
but
do
you
agree
to
that
that
there
is
no
non-reviewable
absolute
right
to
do
away
with
summation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
nevertheless,
do
you
have
the
right?
