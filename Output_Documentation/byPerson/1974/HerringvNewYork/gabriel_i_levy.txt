mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
thank
you
your
honor.
i
want
to
thank
the
court
for
the
kind
indulgence
in
accepting
our
brief
quite
like.
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
your
honor,
the
only
question
here
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
federally
protected
right
to
sum
up
in
a
non-jury
case.
new
york
--
whether
the
right
exist
in
the
jury
case
and
not
new
york
recognizes
that
right,
thereâ€™s
a
unconditional
right
in
new
york
to
sum
up
in
a
jury
case.
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
jury.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
trial
without
a
jury
under
the
united
states
constitution.
the
right
is
granted
by
the
new
york
state
constitution,
but
you
can't
engraft
on
into
the
federal
constitution
a
state
constitutional
right
of
that
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
laigus
against
kumi.
i
would
point
out
that
this
court
has
specifically
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
such
constitutional
right
to
trial
without
a
jury
under
the
federal
constitution,
and
i
believe
that
the
court's,
state's
courts
rules
that
may
provide
for
a
non-jury
trial
and
as
pointed
out
in
singer,
there
maybe
reasonable,
procedural
requirements
tied
in
with
that
waiver.
now,
if
we
start
from
the
premise
that
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
sum
up
in
a
non-jury
case,
we
don't'
even
have
to
reach
the
fact
whether
or
not
there
is
a
knowing
waiver
under
new
york
law.
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
question
of
abuse
of
discretion
was
never
raised
in
the
state
courts.
if
it
had
been
raised
in
the
state
courts,
it
would
have
and
could
have
been
considered
by
the
state
appellate
courts
as
to
whether
or
not
the
judge
properly
refused
to
take
summation.
this
was
a
very
simply
case.
it
was
very
carefully
considered.
it
considered
by
the
court
even
as
pointed
out
by
defendant's
counsel,
very
copious
notes
were
taken
and
it's
right
in
the
record.
at
the
end
of
the
people's
case,
the
charge
of
the
class
d
felony
of
possession
of
a
dangerous
instrument,
that
was
dismissed
at
the
end
of
the
people's
case.
what
was
left
for
the
judge
to
decide
was
whether
he
was
guilty
of
attempted
robbery
in
the
first
degree
which
is
a
class
b
felony
which
subject
him
to
a
25
years
imprisonment,
or
a
class
d
felony
third
degree
--
attempted
robbery
in
the
third
degree
which
only
would
have
subjected
him
to
seven
years.
true
it
only
took
the
judge
eight
minutes
to
decide,
he
found
him
not
guilty
on
the
most
serious
crime
and
found
him
guilty
on
the
lesser
crime.
so,
there
certainly
was
very
careful
consideration
and
what
summation
would
add
in
a
non-jury
case,
especially
in
the
facts
here,
what
right
was
he
deprived
off?
i
think
this
is
very
similar
to
the
right
of
allocution
which
was
considered
by
this
court
in
hill
against
the
united
states,
368
u.s.
424
in
1962,
where
this
court
held
that
the
failure
of
the
court
to
permit
the
defendant
to
be
heard
prior
to
sentencing
in
and
off
itself
was
an
error
which
was
neither
jurisdictional
or
constitutional.
and
certainly,
whether
or
not
the
court
permits
summation
in
a
non-jury
case,
it
does
not
taking
away
a
constitutional
right
from
him.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
jury
here
who
are
lame
and
do
not
understand
the
various
nuances.
we're
dealing
with
a
professional
trier
of
the
facts
of
one
of
your
honors
pointed
out
in
questioning
before,
i
believe
it
was
justice
marshall.
the
judges
are
lawyer.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
complicated
facts.
we're
dealing
here
with
very
simple
things.
and
what
would
be
--
there
might
be
some
gain
on
the
part
of
a
judge
listening
to
summation,
but
there's
no
constitutional
right
being
taken
away
because
no
constitutional
right
exist
in
the
first
instance.
and
furthermore
in
new
york,
a
defendant
who
does
waive
trial
by
jury
also
may
waive
his
unconditional
right
to
sum
up.
if
that
right
of
summation
is
such
that
he
considers
it
so
valuable
and
that
the
facts
of
the
case
are
such
that
require
summation,
all
he
has
to
do
is
insist
on
his
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
jury.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
sum
up
in
the
first
instance
in
a
non-jury
case.
and
if
such
fact,
and
if
such
right
should
exist
which
we
do
not
concede,
the
fact
that
the
new
york
statute
makes
it
discretionary
as
to
whether
or
not
to
permit
summation,
the
waiver
--
inherent
in
the
waiver
of
trail
by
jury
is
also
a
waiver
of
the
unconditional
right
to
sum
up
in
a
non-jury
case.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
yes.
i
believe
there
are
some
cases
in
various
states
which
--
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
no.
i
have
gone
through
the
cases
and
i
would
concede
that
i
think
the
weight
of
authority
--
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
is
against
us,
both
pre
and
post
and
--
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
they
just
talk
about
the
due
process
clause
mr.
justice
brennan.
they
don't
--
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
no.
they
don't
talk
about
the
sixth
amendment
as
such,
and
i'm
talking
on
a
general
overview.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
well,
to
settle
this,
i'm
thinking
of
the
florida
case
which
was
pre-gideon
and
i
believe,
that
was
decided
in
--
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
19
--
it
was
1956,
boyd
against
state,
that
was
decided,
yes,
in
195
--
no,
i
take
it
back.
they
specifically,
they
did
mention
a
right
to
counsel.
in
the
boyd
case,
in
--
i
believe
it
was
the
fifth
circuit,
yes.
the
fifth
circuit,
this
was
a
1968
involving
a
federal
juvenile
delinquency
act
held
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
sum
up
at
least
under
the
federal
juvenile
delinquency
act,
and
that
of
course
was
non-jury
situation.
of
course,
we
have
to
be
reminded
that
with
respect
to
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
a
very,
very
limited
situation.
new
york
is
the
only
state
in
the
united
states
with
such
a
statute,
which
sets
up
the
right
to
--
the
order
of
trial
in
a
non-jury
case.
it's
specifically
vests
in
the
trial
court
a
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
permit
summing
up
only
in
a
non-jury
case.
it
gives
an
unconditional
right
to
sum
up
in
a
jury
case.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
i
know
of
no
statute
judge
white
which
provides
for
summing
up
in
a
civil
case
as
such
in
new
york.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
by
custom
of
usage.
if
by
nothing
else
justice
blackmun,
you
have
the
right
by
custom
in
usage
at
least
in
a
jury
case.
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
new
york,
there's
very
little
summing
up
in
a
non-jury
civil
case
because
that's
usually
handled
on
a
brief
type
situation,
by
the
way,
which
is
also
available
in
a
non-jury
criminal
case,
a
very
often,
i
would
say
very
often
but
when
there
are
sophisticated
questions,
the
judge,
it
doesn't
have
to
decide.
there's
no
immediacy
to
decide
a
criminal
case,
and
he
can
request
briefs
on
both
the
law
and
the
facts.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
by
law
in
new
york,
there
must
be
a
transcript
prepared,
taken
down
in
every
case.
any
indigent
defendant
in
new
york
may
get
an
immediate
copy
of
the
transcript.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
i
think
you
misunderstand
me
justice.
if
the
court
would
require
or
request
a
brief
on
the
facts
on
and
the
law,
there
would
be
no
problem
for
the
court
to
direct
the
court
reporter
to
furnish
a
copy
of
the
transcript
to
both
the
district
attorney
and
the
defendant.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
several
days,
depending
--
i
would
assume
-
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
this
was
only
a
90-page
transcript
your
honor.
i
mean
of
course,
if
you're
dealing
with
a
longer
transcript,
of
course
it
would
take
longer.
but
it's
the
out
story
where
there's
a
will,
there's
a
way.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
i'm
just
talking
about
on
a
hypothetical
question.
ordinarily,
very
often
if
the
defendant
or
the
people
would
request
the
court
if
it
would
like
briefs.
and
as
a
rule,
i
think
the
court
usually
decline
because
judge
--
at
least
justice
barlow,
the
judges
in
new
york
and
particularly
justice
barlow
did
take
very,
very
copious
notes
with
respect
to
this
case.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
that's
correct
your
honor.
it
just
happens
is
that
justice
barlow
was
one
of
the
more
eminent
and
outstanding
judges
in
new
york
and
i
think
the
proof
is
in
the
putting
in
the
facts
in
this
case.
he
found
them
--
he
dismissed
one
charge,
found
him
not
guilty
on
the
most
serious
charge,
and
found
him
guilty
on
the
least
of
all
the
charges,
and
i
think
there
was
very
careful
consideration.
and
obviously,
i
don't
know
what
summation
could
have
gained
the
defendant.
the
defendant
here
as
justice
marshall
previously
pointed
out,
if
you
insisted
on
the
defendant
notwithstanding
the
requirements
that
the
new
york
statute,
and
the
judge
says
all
right,
go
ahead
as
justice
marshall
said,
you
would
still
have
basically
a
bias
listener
and
what
good
is
having
a
bias
listener?
and
with
respect
having
oral
argument
on
every
factual
and
substantive
question,
we
run
into
the
situation
all
the
time
as
--
and
i
believe
justice
stewart
--
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
i'm
not.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
i'm
not
bringing
those
up
justice
marshall.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
i
promise.
mr.
gabriel
i.
levy
and
basically,
there
is
no
fundamental
federally
protected
constitutional
right
to
sum
up
in
a
non-jury
case,
and
the
entire
argument
of
the
appellants
here
is
that
such
right
exists.
and
as
i
said
before,
they
never
raised
in
the
state
courts
the
fact
that
the
defendant,
that
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
refusing
to
grant
summation
in
this
particular
case.
