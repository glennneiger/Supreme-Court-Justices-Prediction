there's
quite
of
difference
between
a
trial
and
an
appellate
procedure
in
that
at
the
trial,
particularly
in
a
bench
trial,
there's
no
questions
of
law
really,
the
factual
issues
to
be
resolved?
justice
potter
stewart
and
just
the
offset
in
the
appellate
process?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
which
way
it
cuts,
but
that
issue
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
customary
in
the
new
york
trial
courts
to
have
trial
memoranda,
some
jurisdictions
--
some
never
heard
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
jackson?
united
states
against
jackson
involving
the
limberg
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
your
brief
for
summary
in
the
briefs
it
said
so.
justice
potter
stewart
and
on
the
statute
as
my
brother
blackmun
suggests
in
his
question,
i
suppose
that
the
standard
would
be
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
cutting
off
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
be
the
standard
of
review.
justice
potter
stewart
not
whether
--
and
that's
rather
as
he
goes
now
of
rather
strict
standard.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct
that
the
standard
would
be
whether
or
not
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
--
justice

stewart
the
second
case
in
which
i
am
authorized
to
announce
the
judgment
and
opinion
this
morning
is
the
case
of
herring
versus
new
york
which
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
of
the
second
judicial
department.
a
new
york
law
confers
upon
every
judge
in
a
nonjury
criminal
trial
the
power
to
deny
counsel
any
opportunity
to
make
a
summation
of
the
evidence
before
the
rendition
of
judgment.
in
the
case
before
us,
we
are
called
upon
to
assess
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
law.
the
appellant,
clifford
herring,
was
brought
to
trial
in
the
supreme
court
of
richmond
county,
new
york
upon
charges
of
attempted
robbery
in
the
first
and
third
degrees
and
possession
of
a
dangerous
instrument.
he
waived
a
jury.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
for
the
prosecution
and
the
defense,
the
appellant's
lawyer
requested
to
?be
heard
somewhat
on
the
facts?
to
quote
the
record.
the
trial
judge
replied
and
again
i'm
quoting
from
the
record,
"under
the
new
statute,
summation
is
discretionary,
and
i
choose
not
to
hear
summations."
end
of
quotation.
the
judge
thereupon
found
the
appellant
guilty
of
attempted
robbery
in
the
third
degree,
and
subsequently
sentenced
him
to
serve
an
indeterminate
term
of
imprisonment
with
a
maximum
of
four
years.
the
conviction
was
affirmed
without
opinion
by
an
intermediate
appellate
court.
and
leave
to
appeal
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
denied.
an
appeal
was
then
brought
here,
and
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
a
written
opinion
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
the
new
york
statute
violates
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
before
us
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
