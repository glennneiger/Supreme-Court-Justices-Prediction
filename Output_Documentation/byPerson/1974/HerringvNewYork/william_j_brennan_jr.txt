justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
steele,
is
this
statute
applied
to
all
arguments
in
the
appellate
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
did
the
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
i
suppose
ms.
steele
at
least
for
some
judges,
it's
easy
to
hear
and
put
all
that
listening
than
they
do
at
reading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
that
kind
of
judge
you
just
have
in
plea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
you're
here
for
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
steele,
i
gather
from
your
reply
brief
that
it
is
a
non-jury
misdemeanor
type
of
trial
to
which
this
statute
applies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
another
but
same
kind
of
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me
in
this
case,
there
was
of
course
a
waiver
of
jury
trial,
was
there
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
state
argues
that
that
waiver
of
jury
trial
because
this
statute
was
on
the
books
at
the
time
when
the
waiver
subsumed,
and
i
gather
you
could
waive
jury
trial
without
the
assistance
counsel,
can't
you
in
new
york?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
this
waiver
subsumes
also
where
the
discretion
is
exercised
against
a
summation,
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
some
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
how
is
that
a
constitutional
argument?
all
we
can
deal
with
here,
the
federal
constitutional
limitation.
is
that
a
constitutional
burden?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
cases
we've
had
are
burden
on
the
constitutional
right
to
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
be
here
attacking
the
statute
on
its
face?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
close
is
that
division?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
constitutional
grounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
holding,
it
is
not
a
constitutional
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
what
federal
constitutional
ground
are
those
concerned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it's
even
before,
we
extended
the
sixth
to
the
states
to
sum
up
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
finally
in
cut?
