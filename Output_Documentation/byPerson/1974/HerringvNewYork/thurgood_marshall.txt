ms.
steele,
what
about
the
different
kind
of
case.
you
got
a
case
where
the
one
prosecuting
witness
and
the
defendant,
that's
all
there
is
and
the
case
took
a
whole
day.
would
you
have
to
have
argument
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
assuming
that
the
judge
could
not
remember
a
whole
day,
what
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
judge
did
get
that
from
the
lawyer,
i
think
the
judge
was
given
this
bias
attention
and
let
him
argue,
and
i
did
make
a
mistake
in
the
word
i
use,
his
biased
attention.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
tell
the
judge
he
doesn't
remember
what
happened
a
half
hour
ago?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he's
not
taking
notes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
he
have
to
make
findings?
doesn't
the
judge
have
to
make
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
rule,
but
he
can
request
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
he
got
it,
then
would
he
still
have
to
have
argue
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
lawyer
himself,
you
know,
he
can
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
can't
remember
like
a
lawyer,
that's
a
tried
in
the
case,
can
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
shouldn't
have
the
biased
opinion
of
the
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
theory
is
that
he
wasn't
there.
he's
already
testified
as
to
his
theory.
in
my
hypothetical,
he's
testified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
judge
says
“it's
a
very
simple
case
and
i
don't
you
see
why
you
need
to
argue”
and
the
lawyer
says
“but
i
insist
on
arguing.
”
and
you
insist
that
he
has
that
right
and
i
submit
as
a
lawyer
who's
tried
a
few
cases
that
that's
not
going
to
help
the
defendant
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
judge
says
“i
don't
want
any
closing
argument”
and
counsel
said
“but
i
insist
you
have
closing
argument.
”
you
think
counsel
will
have
that
right
to
cut
his
own
throat?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
along
with
his
client's
throat?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
judge
tell
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
an
intelligent
waiver?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
saying
about
all.
this
is
only
the
final
end
of
the
trial
we're
talking
about.
we
talk
about
suppression
of
evidence,
justice
thurgood
marshall
confession,
why
are
you
bringing
those
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
promise?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
