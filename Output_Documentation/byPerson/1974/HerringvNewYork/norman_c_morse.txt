mr.
norman
c.
morse
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court
--
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
obvious
that
the
facts
in
this
case
did
not
require
the
trial
judge
to
exercise
any
great
retentive
ability.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
were
issues.
one
was
the
issue
of
alibi
which
turned
the
course
upon
the
testimony
of
the
defendant.
the
other
issue
was
the
--
and
his
employer
who
was
i
would
say
vague
and
evasive
in
his
testimony
as
to
when
he
saw
him
and
so
forth.
the
other
question
i
suppose
would
be
bias,
bias
on
the
part
of
the
complaining
witness
who
said
it
happened
to
him
and
bias
on
part
of
the
defendant
seeking
to
avoid
any
consequences
of
his
act.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
factual
determinations
in
this
case
were
simple
and
were
of
the
kind
that
the
authors
of
the
statute
had
in
mind
when
they
drew
the
statute
that
a
judge
seeing
the
facts
openly
and
plainly
without
any
abuse
of
discretion
could
say
“i
choose
not
to
hear.
”
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
morse
there
is
--
this
question
was
reviewable
in
the
state
court,
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
c.
morse
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
c.
morse
--
that
is
reviewable.
mr.
norman
c.
morse
that's
right.
mr.
norman
c.
morse
now,
--
mr.
norman
c.
morse
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
instance
and
had
this
been
a
protracted
trial,
involve
issues,
perhaps
that
you
could
say
that
it
had
been
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
it
was
not
a
protracted
trial.
the
people
knew
each
other
and
the
issues
raised
as
i
say
were
biased
on
the
one
hand
which
seemed
to
be
absolutely
ephemeral
and
alibi
which
was
vague,
they
were
resolved
against
the
defendant.
now,
it
seems
to
me
here
that
if
there's
a
right
of
summation
in
this
instance
because
of
some
kind
of
historical
basis,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
right
of
summation
would
have
to
carry
over
into
any
fact
finding
process
if
we're
to
distinguish
as
to
substance
and
not
as
to
form.
for
example,
we're
now
regularly
besieged
with
the
procedures
on
identification
suppression,
and
so
forth,
voluntariness
of
confessions.
if
in
each
instance,
not
only
is
there
a
right
to
the
hearing,
but
there's
a
right
to
sum
up
on
the
fact
finding
question,
i
think
we
can
see
that
the
overworked
urban
courts
to
which
my
dedicated
adversary
makes
reference
would
be
even
more
so
if
at
the
end
of
that
fact
finding
process,
there
was
an
insistences
a
matter
of
right,
i
have
a
right
to
analyze,
sum
up,
distinguish
the
most
obvious
of
facts.
so
that
i
feel
in
this
case
therefore
that
we
should
not
have
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
we
have
i
think
a
substantial
waiver,
a
substantial
case
for
waiver
here.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
since,
they
had
to
be
on
record,
they
were
placed
on
the
record
as
to
the
rights
that
they
were
surrendering
in
accepting
a
non-jury
trial.
these
were
spelled
out
i
think
by
the
trial
judge
which
commendable
detail
that
they
selected
that
route,
and
if
you
will,
made
no
comment
whatsoever
that
i'm
doing
this,
but
remember
your
honor,
i
still
want
my
right
of
summation.
mr.
norman
c.
morse
there
was
no
comment
made
one
way
or
another
with
respect
to
summation.
and
of
course,
they
--
mr.
norman
c.
morse
i
say
that's
an
intelligent
waiver.
it's
held
to
be
an
intelligent
waiver
in
the
federal
system.
for
example,
if
a
waiver
of
indictment
is
had,
i
don't
think
that
it's
incumbent
upon
anyone
to
say
to
a
defendant
that
when
you
waive
indictment
in
the
federal
system
and
that
--
by
doing
so,
you
waive
your
right
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
you
waive
that
possibility
that
the
grand
jury
may
not
indict
you.
all
of
the
consequences
of
these
things
when
a
man
is
represented
by
an
attorney,
i
think
are
fairly
presumed
to
be
known
to
him,
else
what
his
attorney
for.
now,
it
does
seem
to
me
your
honors
that
the
singer
against
the
united
states
has
determined
this
matter
in
which
it
says
that
there
--
in
which
the
court
said
that
there
is
no
federally
recognized
right
to
a
criminal
trial
before
a
judge
sitting
alone.
and
if
the
state
of
new
york
has
set
up
a
reasonable
non-jury
procedure,
that
that
is
a
non-jury
procedure
which
this
defendant
or
this
appellant
elected
to
proceed
to
trial
by.
he
has
a
right
to
waive
many
rights.
he
has
a
right
to
obviously
to
stipulate
as
to
testimony.
he
has
a
right
to
testify
and
with
that,
face
the
burden
of
being
examined
as
to
prior
criminal
activity
which
could
never
be
introduced
otherwise.
but
he
does
this
--
when
he
does
this,
he
does
this
with
the
assumption
on
the
part
of
the
court
that
he
does
it
with
a
full
knowledge
of
what
he
surrendering,
and
i
say
that
that
same
reasoning
applies
here.
your
honor,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
reply.
mr.
norman
c.
morse
yes.
