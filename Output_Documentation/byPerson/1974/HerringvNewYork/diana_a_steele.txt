ms.
diana
a.
steele
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
on
this
appeal
is
whether
section
320.23
(c)
of
the
new
york
criminal
procedure
law
which
authorizes
the
trial
of
judge
in
the
non-jury
trial
to
preclude
closing
arguments,
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
right
to
counsel
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
section
in
issue
here
is
contained
in
a
provision,
governing
the
nature
and
conduct
of
the
non-jury
trial
and
provides
that
the
court
may
in
its
discretion
permit
the
parties
to
deliver
summations.
it
was
passed
in
1971
and
prior
to
that
date,
no
statute
covered
the
conduct
of
the
non-jury
trial.
in
this
case
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence,
the
counsel
specifically
requested
to
be
heard
on
the
facts
on
behalf
of
his
client
and
the
court
invoking
the
statute,
denied
his
request.
eight
minutes
later,
he
delivered
the
guilty
verdict.
it's
our
position
that
the
statute
invoked
is
unconstitutional
both
by
its
face
and
as
applied
because
it
deprives
the
defendant
of
his
due
process
right
to
be
heard
and
his
right
to
the
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel.
i
think
it's
basic
to
our
adversary
system
of
criminal
justice
that
defendant
has
a
right
to
be
heard
on
his
own
behalf,
and
that
that
right
is
really
inseparable
from
his
right
to
be
heard
by
counsel
at
every
criminal
--
at
every
critical
stage
of
our
trial
process.
i
think
this
tenant
is
reflected
in
the
historical
development
and
protection
of
the
right
to
closing
arguments
by
the
state
courts,
and
i
think
it's
also
reflected
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
since
powell
versus
alabama
which
have
held
that
in
certain
of
counsel's
professional
functions
are
inherent
in
the
defendant's
right
to
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
i
think
that
the
court
has
discretion
to
stop
closing
argument
and
i
think
that
his
discretion
is
reviewable
on
appeal.
this
is
the
way
it's
been
handled
in
the
jury
trial
context
where
the
right
has
been
established
really
since
that
1827,
it
was
first
to
recognized.
and
i
think
when
the
court
cuts
off
closing
argument,
there
maybe
a
colloquy
demonstrating
what
more
counsel
wanted
to
say
and
wasn't
able
to
say,
and
i
think
that
that's
readily
reviewable
on
appeal.
but
the
absolute
preclusion
of
closing
arguments
doesn't
include
any
indication
of
what
counsel
would
have
said
were
he
permitted
to,
and
i
think
that
in
this
case,
the
statute
authorizes
that
absolute
preclusion.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
now
under
the
new
york
statute,
an
abuse
of
discretion
would
be
reviewed.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
it
is
reviewable,
yes.
but
it's
my
position
that
there
is
no
situation
in
which
the
court
can
preclude
summations
all
together
and
have
that
not
constituted
an
abuse
of
discretion
because
it
really
is
depriving
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
be
heard.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
picking
up
where
i
left
off.
i
think
that
this
statute
in
question
really
runs
counter,
both
to
the
historical
development
of
closing
argument
by
the
states,
and
also
counter
to
this
court's
decisions
which
have
recognized
at
the
benefit
of
certain
of
counsel's
professional
skills
are
inherent
in
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
concept
to
which
a
defendant
is
entitled.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
no,
it
does
not.
it's
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
situation
mr.
justice
brennan
because
in
the
trial
--
in
the
appellate
court,
you
have
an
opportunity
to
file
a
brief.
so,
you
do
get
to
insure
that
the
theory
of
your
case
is
presented
to
the
decision
maker
and
you
can
ensure
that
that
everything
you
want
to
present
to
them
is
presented.
but
in
the
trial
process,
there's
really
--
there's
nothing.
the
judges
left
with
the
disparate
pieces
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
is
really
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
judge
to
weigh
all
the
evidence
and
then
hopefully,
to
draw
the
inferences
that
counsel
would
have
urged
upon
him
had
he
had
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
it
was
after
--
everything
was
elicited
that
he
was
--
that
in
effect,
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
was
withdrawn.
i
think
that
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
i
think
that's
true.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
the
appellate
court
i
think
jurisdiction
to
--
in
new
york
at
least
can
we
determine
facts,
but
they
don't
redetermine
them
with
the
same
--
with
the
same
standard
that
the
trial
court
does.
they
don't
redetermine
credibility.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
they
do
consider
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
i
think
that
when
you
have
a
brief,
i
think
you're
in
a
different
position.
i
think
that
you're
not
as
a
stronger
position
to
urge
the
defense
because
you
don't
have
the
give
and
take
that's
inherent
in
that
oral
presentation.
but
i
think
that
that
you
can
at
lease
insure
a
minimal
level
of
presenting
your
theory
of
the
case
in
appellate
court,
but
you
really
can't
do
in
the
trial
process
unless
you
were
permitted
to
submit.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
i
think
that
could
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well
for
that
kind
of
judge,
yes.
i
think
that
you
would
be
in
a
different
position
if
counsel
had
a
right
to
submit
a
written
document
in
support
of
his
position
at
trial?
ms.
diana
a.
steele
it
wouldn't
satisfy
me,
no
because
i
think
that
in
a
summation,
particularly
in
a
non-jury
trial,
there
is
an
opportunity
for
give
and
take.
there's
also
the
rapport
between
counsel
and
the
judge
would
put
you
in
the
better
position
i
think.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
something
in
the
judgment
of
counsel
i
think
that
he
would
--
to
judge
the
effectiveness
of
his
summation
in
that
situation.
i
think
even
the
most
cynical
judge
may
have
his
mind
jarred
by
counsel's
presentation,
and
may
in
fact
have
something
pointed
up
to
him.
i
think
it's
important
in
the
non-jury
trial,
particularly
to
ensure
the
right
to
closing
argument
because
i
think
it's
important
for
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process.
a
judge
makes
his
decision
totally
alone
in
a
non-jury
trial.
unlike
the
jury
trial
where
the
decision
process
is
collective
and
i
think
that
the
shortcomings
of
individual
jurors
are
compensated
by
this
process.
in
the
non-jury
trial,
the
judge
gets
no
input
at
all
into
his
decision
making
process.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
i
think
that
would
put
me
in
a
different
position.
i
think
that
i
wouldn't
be
a
deprivation
entirely
of
the
right
to
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel,
but
for
the
same
reason
says
the
written
documents
i
think
that
you
wouldn't
have
the
give
and
take
essentially.
i
would
be
comparable
i
think
to
the
written
brief.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
on
issues
of
law
i
think
it
is,
but
on
summations,
not
on
issues
of
fact
i
don't
believe.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
if
counsel
wanted
to
be
heard,
i
think
he
would
have
a
right
to
be
heard
on
certainly
in
the
jury
trial
context,
regardless
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
counsel
would
have
a
right
to
present
a
summation.
i
think
that
really
to
say
that
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
in
that
--
to
a
summation
in
that
sense
is
to
conclusively
presume
in
spite
of
his
thought
that
he
has
something
to
say
that
he
didn't
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
i
think
that
there
are
two
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
oh,
i
think
that
there
are
two
reasons
that
we
must
require
closing
argument
in
a
non-jury
trial.
one
is
to
insure
that
the
judge
will
have
an
accurate
presentation
of
the
facts
and
will
remember
accurately.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes
your
honor,
but
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
no.
unlike
the
federal
non-jury
trial,
in
new
york
where
counsel
can
request
findings
of
fact
in
conclusion
of
the
law,
in
new
york,
they
don't
have
that
rule.
they’re
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
he
can
request
that,
but
there
is
no
assurance
that
he
would
get
it.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
i
think
that
he
would
because
while
findings
of
facts
in
conclusion
of
law
protect
the
accuracy
of
the
judge's
memory
because
it
ensures
that
he
goes
over
the
evidence,
there's
also
another
basis
for
requiring
closing
argument,
and
that
is
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes
your
honor,
but
i
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
but
i
think
it's
critical
that
the
defense
get
its
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
i
think
that
another
prong
of
this
argument
is
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
have
his
theory
presented
to
have
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
he
has
but
i
think
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
have
his
attorney
draw
the
inferences,
favorable
to
the
defense
on
that
evidence.
i
mean
that's
what
counsel
is
therefore
to
present
the
defense
side
of
the
case,
and
in
cross-examination,
he
may
have
elicited
things
that
without
emphasis
because
he
didn't
want
to
emphasize
things
that
were
damaging
to
the
prosecution.
and
in
closing
argument,
counsel
then
can
draw
those
inferences
and
really
present
the
defense
theory
to
the
fact
finder.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
that
maybe
true
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
i
think
that
counsel
is
entitled
to
make
the
decision
that
this
will
not
help
the
defendant
at
all
and
waive
closing
argument.
i
think
that
that's
a
decision
which
counsel
must
be
entitled
to
make
because
even
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
i
do.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
i
think
that
that's
counsel
should
be
entitled
to
make
that
decision.
but
i
think
that
you
assume
that
counsel
is
making
perhaps
the
wrong
decision,
but
i
think
the
decision
and
presenting
that
defense
theory
must
rest
with
counsel
and
not
with
the
court.
i
think
that
--
well
particularly
in
our
urban
courts
where
the
case
load
pressure
is
very
high,
judges
do
become
cynical.
they
maybe
inattentive
for
any
number
of
reasons,
and
i
think
that
in
those
situations,
closing
argument
can
easily
be
dispensed
with
precisely
when
it
shouldn’t
because
our
trial
process
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
a
verdict
will
be
rendered
upon
a
fair
evaluation
of
the
evidence.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
under
the
new
york
statute,
the
judge
did
have
the
discretion,
and
i
think
there
wasn't
too
much
more
for
counsel
to
say.
he
did
request
to
be
heard
and
when
the
statute
was
invoked,
he
was
denied
the
right
and
then
the
defendant
was
remanded
right
after
that.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
i
think
he
did
make
his
record,
yes
your
honor.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
i
think
to
that
would
vary
on
a
case-to-case
basis.
i
think
that
it
is
within
the
court's
discretion
to
limit
summation,
to
cut-off
summation,
and
that
would
be
subject
to
review
to
see
if
the
right
had
been
infringed.
in
the
context
of
jury
trial
summations,
that's
the
way
it
has
been
handled
in
the
various
states.
i
think
that
of
all
those
the
cases
in
the
footnote
on
page
14
of
my
brief,
all
but
four
of
them
arose
in
the
improper
infringement
of
the
right
when
--
i
think
that
it's
readily
reviewable
because
when
the
court
tries
to
cut
counsel
off,
counsel
can
presumably
say
“well,
but
i
didn't
present
this
theory”
and
i
think
that
the
appellate
court
can
go
back
and
look
and
see
if
there
was
an
infringement.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
that's
right
because
i
think
in
the
very
different
position
when
the
court
has
said
“i've
heard
enough”
from
when
the
court
says
“i
don't
want
to
hear
anything.”
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
in
fact,
he
had
been
listening
over
--
to
approximately
three
days
that
was
spread
over
a
five-day
period,
the
weekend
intervened,
and
i
think
you
can
fairly
well
presume
that
the
judge
did
attend
to
other
matters
aside
from
this
case.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
i
think
that
it
is
counsel's
decision
at
the
end
of
the
evidence
to
consider
whether
he
can
assist
the
fact
finder,
whether
his
theory
of
the
defense
has
been
presented
adequately
to
ensure
that
the
judge
will
consider
all
the
evidence.
i
think
that
that's
counsel's
decision.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
brooks
versus
tennessee
and
in
ferguson
versus
georgia
point
strongly
to
this
effect
because
in
--
well
in
brooks,
the
court
struck
down
the
tennessee
statute
which
required
the
defendant
to
be
the
first
witness
or
loss
his
right
to
testify.
and
there,
the
court
said
that
this
was
so
critical
to
the
defense
that
it
had
to
be
left
to
counsel's
decision
whether
and
when
to
put
his
client
on
the
stand.
even
more
on
point,
i
think
is
ferguson
versus
georgia
where
the
court
struck
down
the
georgia
statute
which
precluded
counsel
from
eliciting
from
the
defendant
his
unsworn
statement
to
the
jury
because
in
georgia
at
that
time,
the
defendant
was
incompetent
to
testify
and
so,
he
gave
a
unsworn
statement.
and
the
court
there
held
that
it
was
inherent
really
in
the
concept
of
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
to
ensure
that
facts
favorable
to
the
defense
were
elicited
in
an
orderly,
coherence,
and
logical
fashion.
i
think
that
that
function
is
precisely
what
comes
into
play
in
summation.
counsel
must
in
summation,
deliver
to
the
fact
finder,
the
defense
theory,
he
organizes
it,
he
present
it
cogently
because
that's
what
he's
been
trained
to
do.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
an
identical
statute
applies
to
it,
yes.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
there
was
a
waiver.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
i
believe
you
can.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
that
is
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
--
the
state's
position.
i
think
that
that
argument
has
a
no
merit
on
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
because
i
think
that
it's
putting
in
impermissible
condition
on
appellant's
statutory
right
to
forgo
a
jury.
i
think
that
the
argument
-
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
yes.
i
think
it
is
because
it's
requiring
him
to
forgo
his
right
to
summation
when
he
goes
non-jury.
i
think
the
analogous
cases
would
be
green
versus
united
states
and
north
carolina
versus
pearce
where
the
defendant
was
exercising
a
statutory
right
to
appeal,
and
he
was
--
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
he
was
penalized.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
yes.
now
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes,
but
i
--
well,
as
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
and
in
green
versus
united
states,
that
was
the
statutory
right
to
appeal
and
yet,
the
court
didn't
permit
penalizing
someone
for
electing
to
exercise
that
statutory
right.
here,
he's
elected
to
forgo
with
jury,
and
he's
being
penalized
by
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
if
you
assume
that
these
two
can
be
tied
in
together
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
i
think
it
would
still
be
an
impermissible
condition.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
no.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
waive
the
jury
trial,
no.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
state
can
place
a
condition
which
requires
him
to
forgo
a
totally
independent
constitutional
right.
the
right
to
summation
has
no
relation
to
the
right
to
forgo
a
jury.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
no.
i
think
the
waiver
argument
doesn't
have
any
merit.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
legitimate
state
purpose
in
requiring
the
penalty
of
foregoing
a
jury
trial.
i
think
that
the
new
york
statute
concerning
the
reasonable
procedural
regulations
going
to
waiving
the
jury
trial
adequately
preserves
the
state's
interest
on
insisting
in
jury
trials.
the
only
other
conceivable
interest
that
this
would
further
would
be
speed
and
i
don't
think
that
the
state
has
any
legitimate
state
interest
in
making
the
non-jury
trial,
any
speedier
than
it
already
is
than
the
jury
trial.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
i
do
not
know
in
the
civil
cases
in
new
york
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
well,
i
think
that
two
states
have
held
that
the
right
in
the
non-jury
trial
is
absolute
in
the
civil
context.
in
the
civil
jury
trial,
i
believe
that
there's
no
question
but
you
have
a
right
to
closing
argument.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
i'm
here
because
i
think
that
this
is
a
deprivation
of
a
criminal
defendant's
right
to
counsel,
and
his
due
process
right
to
be
heard
on
the
evidence.
i
think
i
would
be
in
the
different
posture
were
this
a
civil
case.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
i
believe
that
the
weight
of
authority
holds
that
there
is
a
right
to
closing
argument.
excuse
me.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes
your
honor.
there
are
four
jurisdictions
that
are
against
me.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
there
are
nine
jurisdictions
that
are
hold
that
it
is
a
fundamental
right.
ms.
diana
a.
steele
on
constitutional
grounds.
there
are
two
more
states
in
pre-gideon
decisions
that
use
their
state
constitutional
guarantees
of
counsel.
and
there
are
four
jurisdictions
which
have
refused
to
recognize
the
right.
in
one
of
the
--
ms.
diana
a.
steele
yes.
they've
refused
to
recognize
it.
one
did
it
without
opinion,
i
think.
another
said
that
it
was
the
better
practice
to
hear
summation,
and
another
was
in
the
juvenile
context.
i
think
in
closing,
i
would
simply
like
to
reiterate
that
i
think
that
the
statute
is
really
contrary
to
the
historical
development
in
preservation
of
the
right
to
closing
argument.
i
think
it
really
deprives
the
defendant
of
the
benefit
of
counsel's
professional
skill
which
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
brooks
and
in
ferguson.
and
finally,
i
think
that
is
the
right
to
closing
argument,
particularly
in
the
non-jury
trial
is
essential
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process,
where
that
fact
finder
is
a
single
individual.
he's
presumably
fallible
just
like
anybody
else,
and
he
may
well
be
in
an
overburden
court.
i
think
that
those
are
the
three
basic
reasons
why
a
statute
which
deprives
appellant
of
that
right
is
violative
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
counsel
provision
of
the
sixth.
thank
you.

diana
