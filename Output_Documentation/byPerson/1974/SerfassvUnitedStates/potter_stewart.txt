justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
quite
true
when
you
come
to
the
twice
being
put
in
jeopardy,
is
it?
or
is
it
--
let's
assume
that
clearly
he
was
put
in
jeopardy
once.
and
then
could
he
be
indicted
again
for
the
same
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
well.
justice
potter
stewart
by
hypothesis
in
my
question
he
has
been
put
in
jeopardy
once,
he's
gone
through
all
through
a
trial,
a
fair
due
process
trial,
the
jury
has
deliberated
and
they
have
returned
of
verdict
of
not
guilty
upon
which
judgment
was
entered.
now,
could
he
be
indicted
again
for
the
same
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
being
put
in
jeopardy
doesn't
really
mean
that
at
least
when
you're
talking
about
the
second
being
put
in
jeopardy,
doesn’t
really
mean
which
is
(voice
overlap),
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
be
indicted
again
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
expense
of
having
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
defend
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
constitutionally
it
can
be
done?
justice
potter
stewart
could
even
be
arraigned?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
doesn't
the
double
jeopardy
provision
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
a
person
is
once
been
put
in
jeopardy
and
that’s
the
hypothesis
of
my
question
that
he
can't
ever
be
charged
again?
he
can't
be
bothered
by
the
state
with
defending
the
same
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
then
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
to
so?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
quite
clear.
what
you
told
us
originally
suggested
that
if
all
of
these
things
could
happen
to
him
a
second
time
right
after
the
impaneling
of
a
jury
and
that
really
is
not
true,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
after
a
person
has
once
been
put
in
jeopardy
and
that
led
to
a
clear-cut
verdict
of
conviction
or
acquittal?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
that's
what
does
follow.
