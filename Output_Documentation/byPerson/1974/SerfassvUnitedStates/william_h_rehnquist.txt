h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
difference
in
the
language
in
the
bills
make
much
difference
mr.
dower,
isn't
it
clear
from
the
bill
that
was
enacted
that
congress
meant
to
authorize
appeals
in
all
cases
unless
appeal
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
the
moment
ago
that
your
hypothesis
is
that
double
jeopardy
was
when
the
fact-finding
process
begins.
now,
you
say
that
in
this
rule
12
motion
there's
no
issue
of
fact
involved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
on
a
motion
like
that
can
the
judge
who
hears
the
motion
find
facts
rather
than
simply
decide
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
there's
anything
to
support
the
governmentâ€™s
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
law?
