justice

marshall
except
that
you
can't
go
to
jail
without
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
really
a
conclusion
that
those
facts
do
not
amount
to
a
sufficient
evidence
to
convict?
if
it's
a
more
conclusion
of
law
then
it
is
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
has
got
the
facts
that
--
what
does
he
find
that
that
is
the
file?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
this
order
it
said
that
i
conclude
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
legally
correct.
did
nobody
say
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
made
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
his
finding
was
a
conclusion.
i
don’t
want
to
get
all
involved
in
facts
in
law
or
idea.
your
point
is
that
he
made
a
conclusion
of
law
that
these
facts
would
not
be
sufficient
to
convict
this
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
really
mean
is
that
for
the
two
jeopardy,
is
one
is
different
from
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
word
means
two
different
things.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
korman,
as
mr.
dower
corrected
there's
no
dispute,
that
that’s
all
the
evidence
would
have
been
produced
at
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
means
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what
good
is
a
trial
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
he
wrong
in
his
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
the
--
mr.
serfass
or
what
his
name
is
–
he
decided
that
he
would
go
to
trial
and
he
would
put
on
the
evidence
everything
that
he
is
in
good
shape
as
long
as
he
is
before
that
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
why
didn't
that
end
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
have
been
acquitted,
wouldn't
he?
