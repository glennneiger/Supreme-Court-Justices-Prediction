chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
73-1424,
serfass
against
the
united
states.
mr.
dower.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
dower.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
help
me
back
up
a
little
bit
if
i
may
mr.
dower.
in
the
hearing
on
your
motion
before
judge
sheridan,
could
he
have
made
a
finding
or
determination
of
the
guilt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
determination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now,
but
could
he
have
made
a
determination
that
the
man
was
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
there
was
no
necessity
of
going
on
with
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
don't
quite
go
that
far,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
jeopardy
would
attach
as
soon
as
the
jury
was
in
panel
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
not
a
complete
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
jeopardy
in
the
sense
of
exposure
to
a
judgment
of
guilt
begin
under
this
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
consequence
of
what
you're
arguing
though
is
that
in
these
circumstances,
this
motion
in
itself
becomes
the
trial
of
the
case.
if
it
has
the
outcome
that
it
had
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
defendant
is
successful
it
has
the
effect
of
being
in
trial
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
is
it
not
true
that
under
the
federal
statutes
in
order
to
have
the
jury
waived
trial
in
the
criminal
case,
you
must
have
the
consent
of
the
prosecution,
the
defense
and
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
you
think
that
statute
is
any
barrier
here
or
the
party
is
just
slipped
sideways
into
a
trial
on
the
merits
without
having
consented
to
submit
the
issue
on
the
merits
to
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
korman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
what
you're
saying
if
it
were
transposed
into
a
civil
context
instead
of
criminal
is
that
if
a
suit
were
had
on
a
civil
case
and
it
results
favorable
to
one
of
the
parties,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
losing
party
from
bringing
a
suit
again
on
the
same
issues
that
he
has
to
assert
the
defense
of
res
judicata
in
order
to
stop
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
same
thing
as
through
an
indictment.
he
maybe
indicted
by
ill-informed
or
irresponsible
grand
jury
with
the
aid
of
a
irresponsible
or
ill-informed
prosecutor
and
the
only
way
he
can
assert
his
right
is
to
go
in
and
assert
his
first
jeopardy
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you're
not
suggesting
that
or
are
you
suggesting
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
second
indictment
can't
be
determined
in
any
other
way
and
by
a
judicial
proceeding
in
which
double
jeopardy
is
asserted
and
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
korman.
you
have
about
three
minutes
left
mr.
dower.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
any
power
you
know
of
even
in
a
true
double
jeopardy
case
as
to
which
no
one
would
disagree
that
is
a
verdict
of
acquittal
if
an
irresponsible
jury
as
i
suggested
before
a
grand
jury
re-indicted.
it
creates
all
of
this
stress,
does
it
not
that
you're
speaking
of?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
other
way
to
deal
with
that
indictment
except
to
go
in
and
assert
the
claim
of
double
jeopardy
and
have
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suit
against
the
prosecutor
or
any
other
suit
--
he
might
have
a
suit
whether
it’s
a
good
one
or
not,
he
might
conceivably
have
a
suit
against
members
of
the
grand
jury
and
again
you
would
have
a
question
of
whether
it
was
any
good
but
there’s
nothing
automatic
that
stops
a
second
indictment,
does
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
integrity
of
the
people
on
(voice
overlaps)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
for
their
intelligence
if
they
were
ill
informed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
might
simply
make
a
mistake.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
grand
jury
might
not
be
informed
by
the
prosecutor
that
the
man
had
been
previously
tried
and
acquitted
and
then
you’d
have
perhaps
various
kinds
of
proceedings
against
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
dower.
thank
you
mr.
korman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
opinion

announce
in
no.
