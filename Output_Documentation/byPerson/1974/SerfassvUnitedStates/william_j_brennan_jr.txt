well,
mr.
dower,
i
gather
that
your
basic
submission
is
that
what
happened
here
since
the
disposition
of
motion
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
file
and
other
evidence
that
as
you
say
it
represents
what
would
have
been
the
government's
entire
case
that
the
jury
being
convened
in
the
case
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
should
be
treated
as
a
functional
equivalent
of
an
acquittal
even
though
you
concede
that
could
not
have
been
any
judgment
of
guilt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
that
right?
is
that
what
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
aren't
you
still
arguing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
demurrer
of
the
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
demurrer
of
the
evidence
that
succeeded
and
had
the
effect
on
the
acquittal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
old
practice?
