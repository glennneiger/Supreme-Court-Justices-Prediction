justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
confess
to
some
confusions
mr.
dower.
i
thought
you
said
to
me
earlier
that
what
this
came
down
to
us
is
that
judge
sheridan
had
before
him
all
of
the
evidence
that
would’ve
constituted
the
government’s
case,
had
it
gone
to
a
jury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that
he
appraised
that
for
sufficiency
to
get
to
the
jury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
he
concluded
that
it
was
insufficient?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
therefore,
he
dismissed
the
indictment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
now
you
say
there's
some
fact-finding
involved
to
that?
