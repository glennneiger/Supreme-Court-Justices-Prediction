mr.
harry
a.
dower
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
if
i
may
sir,
i'd
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
please
your
honors,
this
matter
appeared
before
the
court
having
granted
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
the
petition
of
david
serfass
to
review
the
record
of
the
third
circuit
which
had
reversed
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania.
chief
judge
michael
sheridan
had
granted
and
ordered
dismissing
the
indictment
on
motion
having
been
filed
on
behalf
of
mr.
serfass.
he
had
been
indicted
for
refusing
to
submit
to
induction
under
the
selective
service
act.
david
serfass
was
in
the
peace
corp
in
pohnpei,
a
remote
island
in
the
pacific
and
he
had
completed
his
two
years
of
duty
there
and
was
requested
by
the
panape
transportation
authority
to
serve
several
months
longer
to
complete
the
training
of
a
native
as
a
maintenance
superintendent.
there
was
some
mix
up
in
his
notifying
his
draft
board
that
his
term
in
the
peace
corps
had
been
concluded.
he
did
receive
a
notice
to
report
for
induction
--
there
was
again
another
mix-up
but
he
did
make
it
to
allentown
his
residence,
2
a.m
on
the
day
that
he
was
to
report
for
transportation
at
5
a.
m.
he
went
to
the
induction
center
in
wilks-barre
and
was
found
to
be
suffering
from
amoebic
dysentery
and
was
returned
to
report
at
a
later
date.
it
was
at
that
interval
for
the
first
time
that
he
spoke
to
the
pastor
of
this
church
and
learned
and
in
his
discussions
with
his
pastor,
he
began
to
have
very
serious
reservations
about
serving
in
a
military
service.
he
then
upon
advice
applied
for
form
150
from
the
selective
service
administration
which
is
the
form
to
be
used
for
an
application
for
classification
of
the
conscientious
objector.
the
draft
board
perfunctorily
denied
his
application
and
just
stated
to
him
that
there
was
no
change
in
classification
over
which
he
had
no
control
and
again
ordered
him
to
report
for
induction.
this
time,
he
again
went
to
the
induction
center
and
the
usual
procedure
in
case
of
this
kind
at
the
last
minute,
refused
to
take
oath
and
to
submit
to
induction.
about
20
months
later,
he
was
indicted
and
arrested
and
a
trial
date
was
set
for
speedy
trial.
at
that
time,
we
filed
two
motions,
one,
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
also
a
concurrent
or
simultaneous
motion
to
postpone
the
trial.
judge
sheridan
did
grant
--
ordered
the
postponement
of
the
trial,
set
a
date
for
oral
argument
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
and
at
that
argument,
the
united
states
attorney
did
stipulate
that
the
application
for
conscientious
objector
classification,
which
david
serfass
had
made
did
meet
the
prima
facie
requirements.
following
this
and
with
a
short
time
after
the
oral
argument,
judge
sheridan
requested
and
this
was
agreed
by
both
parties
by
david
serfass
and
by
the
united
states
that
his
entire
selective
service
file
be
submitted
to
judge
sheridan
and
this
was
done.
some
months
later,
judge
sheridan
pursuant
to
a
line
of
cases
in
the
third
circuit
did
grant
the
motion,
did
order
that
dismissal
of
indictment.
the
government
appealed
and
we
moved
to
dismiss
in
the
third
circuit
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
that
matter
as
well
as
the
argument
on
the
merits
were
briefed
simultaneously.
the
third
circuit
at
that
time
had
adopted
a
procedure
whereby
on
its
own
order
would
dispense
with
oral
argument
and
that
was
done
in
this
case.
it
of
course
has
oral
arguments
within
this
case,
there
was
an
oral
argument.
now,
the
time
interval
here
was
interesting,
this
court
in
its
decision
in
elhert
had
indicated
that
there
is
a
no
mans
land
between
the
draft
board
having
considered
a
request
on
the
merits
for
conscientious
objector
classification
after
notice
of
induction
had
been
received,
and
the
same
kind
of
rather
and
a
consideration
of
this
issue
within
the
military
service,
that
the
court
may
very
well
consider
that
to
be
as
a
situation
different
from
elhert.
the
musser
case
which
was
decided
last
summer
in
a
per
curiam
opinion,
i
think
only
one
dissent,
justice
douglas
dissented,
in
a
sense
clarified
at
least
for
the
third
circuit,
the
holding
in
elhert
and
under
musser,
it
was
held
that
the
draft
boards
had
no
power
to
consider
a
request
for
conscientious
objector
classification
after
a
notice
of
induction
had
been
sent.
as
a
consequence,
the
third
circuit
reversed
on
the
merits
and
also
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir,
i'm
sorry,
not
a
finding
of
guilt,
he
could
have
made
determination.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
he
could
have
terminated
the
case
which
is
what
he
did.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
no
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
no
sir,
he
could
not
have
made
a
finding
of
guilty.
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
it
was
accompanied
by
an
affidavit
relating
to
several
pages
from
the
selective
service
file,
but
no
jury
trial
has
ever
been
waived.
there
was
no
formal
motion
for
acquittal,
it's
quite
correct
sir
that
we
do
not
argue
for
a
moment,
that
he
could’ve
been
found
guilty
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
not
having
been
tried.
after
the
denial
--
after
the
reversal
of
the
district
court
order
by
the
third
circuit,
we
then
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
i'm
quite
aware
that
there
are
several
other
cases
that
we
argued
this
morning
all
of
which
have
come
up
at
the
same
time.
and
generally
deal
with
the
1971
criminal
appeals
act
which
was
an
amendment
to
the
act
following
this
court’s
decision
in
sisson.
i
think
perhaps
for
me
at
least
the
only
thing
it's
clear
about
the
1971
amendment
is
that
it
was
a
response
for
this
court's
decision
in
sisson.
now,
this
act
is
different,
and
so
far
as
i
know,
these
are
the
first
cases
to
come
up
under
this
act,
now
raising
that
question
as
to
what
the
act
means
at
least
in
particularly
in
reference
to
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
now,
the
act
i
would
note
and
i
think
this
is
quite
important.
is
not
the
bill
that
was
introduced
into
the
senate.
the
act
now
provides
that
in
a
criminal
case
and
appeal
by
the
united
states
shall
lie
to
a
court
of
appeals
from
an
order
dismissing
an
indictment
and
the
important
words
at
least
as
far
as
were
concerned
is
except
that
no
appeal
should
rely
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
if
the
constitution
prohibits
it.
now,
there
were
back
at
the
point
where
perhaps
we
were
in
1907
when
the
senate
considering
the
original
criminal
appeals
act
had
decided
or
had
rather
debated,
that
they're
going
to
depend
upon
this
court
to
tell
the
senate
and
tell
us
what
double
jeopardy
meant,
because
of
all
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
particularly
in
the
recent
years
and
many
of
them
under
the
selective
service
act,
there
really
is
no
firm
guide
for
anyone
so
far
as
i
can
see
to
know
just
what
double
jeopardy
means
in
terms
of
pre-trial.
in
some
cases
post-trial
dismissals
of
an
indictment
or
of
a
charge
whatever
it
maybe
called.
sisson
of
course
was
a
post-trial
dismissal.
serfass
is
a
pre-trial
dismissal,
the
second
case
you
have
today,
the
jenkins
case
is
one
of
which
is
again
a
post-trial
dismissal
--
oh,
i'm
sorry,
it
was
an
acquittal
in
the
trial
by
a
judge
and
the
third
case
that
you
have
this
morning,
the
wilson
case,
is
one
in
which
there
was
a
dismissal
of
a
charge
after
a
trial.
now,
in
serfass,
we
argue
that
this
act,
the
1971
criminal
appeals
act
must
have
some
meaning
in
order
not
to
be
a
truism.
i
would
dispose
off
the
latter
part
first
by
saying
that
i
cannot
conceive
how
congress
could
enact
the
criminal
appeals
act
which
would
authorize
the
united
states
to
appeal
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
congress
does
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
but
i
cannot
understand
and
i'm
very
happy
that
we
don't
have
to
argue
or
don’t
have
that
case
that
an
appeal
would
lie,
which
is
contrary
to
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
so,
if
this
exception
is
to
have
any
meaning,
then
this
is
what
i
assume
what
these
cases
are
about,
just
what
is
double
jeopardy.
now,
i
would
also
point
out
that
as
i
understand
the
real
burden,
the
real
thrust
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
serfass
case
and
to
some
extent
in
the
others
too.
what
the
government
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
have
decisions
of
this
court
which
in
effect
would
reinstate
the
bill
as
introduced
into
the
senate.
under
which
an
appeal
would
have
been
possible
from
any
pre-trial
disposition
of
a
case,
short
of
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction
of
course,
everyone
would
be
appealing
a
conviction.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
i
don't
think
so
sir.
when
congress
said
that
an
appeal
in
the
criminal
case
lies
from
an
order
dismissing
an
indictment,
surely
it
must
contemplate
that
there
are
situations
in
which
a
dismissal
would
have
a
reason
or
would
have
brought
about
--
i'm
sorry,
that
prior
to
dismissal,
jeopardy
would
have
attached.
now,
i
think
except
for
the
jenkins
case,
which
is
to
be
argued
next,
everybody
has
always
talked
that
an
acquittal
was
an
end
to
a
proceeding.
this
was
far
back
in
1896
in
the
ball
case
and
1904
in
the
kepner
case,
acquittals
ended.
so,
that
what
we
are
really
talking
about
is
at
least
in
serfass
is
a
pre-trial
disposition
of
the
case
in
some
fashion
other
than
an
acquittal.
now,
what
is
the
--
what
does
this
act
mean?
if
it's
not
a
truism,
does
it
not
address
itself
to
a
situation
where
an
indictment
has
been
dismissed
short
of
a
trial.
and
if
jeopardy
has
attached
in
that
proceeding,
then
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
constitution
would
prohibit
this.
i
am
quite
aware
sir,
mr.
justice
white
that
your
distinction
in
your
dissent
in
the
sisson
case
of
the
distinction
made
between
technical
and
constitutional
jeopardy
and
i'm
quite
willing
to
admit
that
the
manner
and
which
we
used
the
word
technical
jeopardy
in
our
brief
is
different
from
the
way
you
used
it
and
i
--
further
reflection
i
think
that
perhaps
your
distinction
if
i
understand
that
would
be
more
appropriate.
but
when
does
jeopardy
attach
is
to
a
large
extent
the
question
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
and
in
fact,
what
is
jeopardy?
the
government
argues
that
there
is
no
jeopardy
until
there
has
been
a
trial,
either
by
a
jury
or
trial
by
a
judge
alone.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
repeatedly,
in
their
brief,
they
do.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
well,
this
would
be
included
within
from
that
trial.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
no,
sir,
they
quite
--
mr.
harry
a.
dower
i'm
not
so
sure
sir
that
that
is
the
import
of
all
the
cases.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
in
sisson
for
example,
went
so
far
to
say
that
exposure
to
guilt
was
necessary.
and
this
is
--
really
what
i
would
argue
is
that
we
ought
to
determine
what
is
involved
in
a
trial
and
whether
it's
by
jury
or
by
judge
alone,
and
i
submit
sir
that
this
is
a
fact-finding
process
--
generally
as
to
the
merits
or
as
to
some
issue
which
would
permanently
would
dispose
off
the
case.
now,
i
don't
see
any
mystical
value
and
in
a
trial
or
such
or
impaneling
a
jury
to
commence
a
trial
because
what
--
mr.
harry
a.
dower
well,
again
sir
you
are
--
as
i
understand
your
question
or
comment,
unless
a
man
has
been
exposed
to
being
held
guilty,
he
is
not
been
in
jeopardy
and
this
i
submit
sir
is
not
in
the
holding
of
this
court
as
recently
as
sisson.
that
one
could
although
the
facts
of
the
sisson
case
sir
are
different.
nonetheless,
this
court
did
cite
with
approval
of
a
large
number
of
cases
in
which
jeopardy
was
held
to
attach
prior
to
exposure
to
finding
of
guilty.
i
am
not
quite
clear
with
this.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
all
the
cases
sir
reached
so
hard
as
did
the
majority
in
this
court
to
find
that
the
determination
made
by
court
was
an
acquittal.
and
i
suggest
sir
that
you
don't
need
to
constrict
yourselves
by
the
label
of
an
acquittal
that
once
fact-finding
has
commenced
in
reference
to
an
issue
that
would
dispose
off
the
case
that
this
is
when
jeopardy
attaches.
now,
the
reason
i
say
this
and
argue
in
this
fashion
is
that,
all
of
the
old
cases
which
talked
in
terms
of
jeopardy
arising
upon
a
trial
or
an
impaneling
of
the
jury,
are
cases
when
our
pleading
and
practice
procedure
was
such
this
was
nearly
the
only
way
to
dispose
off
an
issue.
we
did
not
have
rule
of
criminal
procedure
12
(b)
(1)
or
really
rule
12
and
all
its
parts.
the
common
law
aside
from
the
motion
on
arrest
of
judgment
which
gave
everybody
so
much
trouble
in
the
sisson
case,
the
motion
in
bar
--
aside
from
that,
nearly
the
only
way
that
i
know
of
to
dispose
off
a
case
was
by
a
trial.
now,
in
the
last
70
years,
we
have
developed
new
and
modern
methods
of
pleading
and
practice.
now
that
started
with
the
court
pleading
as
adopted
in
the
states
in
the
late
1930's
where
there
are
rules
of
civil
procedure,
federal
rules
and
in
1946,
i
think
it's
the
date
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
and
we
have
done
away
with
the
old
common
law
terms
of
demurrer.
speaking
demurrers
yet
when
i
am
speaking
demur,
common
law
was
prohibited,
yet
this
is
precisely
--
i'm
sorry,
this
is
what
it's
not
really
precisely.
this
is
what
rule
12
(b)
(1)
provides
for.
some
method
of
disposing
of
issues
prior
to
a
full
trial
where
if
you
like
the
court
must
go
outside
of
the
indictment,
the
bare-bones
indictment
in
order
to
make
the
determination.
rule
12
(b)
(4)
provides
for
the
holding
of
a
hearing
to
make
these
determinations.
another
rule
47
i
believe
it
is
which
permits
the
filing
of
an
affidavit
in
connection
with
these
things.
now,
this
is
different
from
the
1907
act.
the
way
these
issues
can
be
brought
before
our
court
today
are
entirely
different.
we
now
--
and
this
is
what
was
done
in
the
serfass
case.
now,
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
any
of
the
facts
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
all
of
the
government's
evidence
incidentally
was
in,
was
before
the
judge,
although
i
quite
agree
there
was
no
possibility
finding
him
guilty
at
that
time,
but
the
court
did
consider
the
entire
bit
of
evidence
that
the
government
had.
excuse
me,
this
is
also
noted
not
in
precisely
to
those
terms
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
letter
in
the
last
several
pages
of
their
brief.
they
also
acknowledged.
now,
what
happens
in
the
prosecution
of
a
selective
service
case
is
that
the
government
gets
the
entire
selective
service
file
and
evidence
as
a
business
record.
occasionally,
there
will
be
an
officer
from
the
induction
center
to
testify
but
whatever
evidence
the
government
has
is
in
the
selective
service
file.
now,
that
was
a
situation
in
the
serfass
case,
unlike
brewster
for
example,
where
this
court
held
that
an
appeal
would
lie
from
an
order
dismissing
the
indictment
where
one
did
not
have
to
go
outside
the
indictment
for
the
disposition
of
the
case.
but
here,
this
was
necessary.
now,
i
propose
or
submit
to
your
honors
that
in
this
part
of
the
20th
century,
what
double
jeopardy
means
or
should
mean
is
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
fact-finding
process
begins,
as
to
an
issue
which
would
dispose
off
the
case.
now,
no
case
that
i
ever
heard
have
read
speaks
in
those
terms
precisely
in
those
terms,
but
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
circuit
courts,
they
have
held
to
this
effect.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
we
argue
that
but
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes,
in
our
brief
we
are
arguing
in
that
fashion.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
no,
i'm
going
to
be
on
that
sir
and
i'm
saying
that
let's
not
confine
ourselves
to
labels
of
acquittal
in
order
to
find
that
jeopardy
has
existed
because
this
is
what
has
caused
so
much
trouble
at
least
to
my
analysis.
all
that
we
need
to
say
is
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
a
fact-finding
process
begins.
and
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
with
sympathy
at
least
in
part
with
the
dissenters
in
sisson
that
there
was
a
tremendous
reaching
to
find
acquittal
in
order
to
bring
the
case
within
the
ambit
of
the
old
common
law
cases.
and
i
submit
sir
that
this
isn't
necessary
anymore
given
particularly
rule
12
(b)
(1).
if
i
would
come
back
mr.
justice
brennan
to
one
other
observation,
the
real
functional
equivalent
of
the
serfass
case
is
one
in
which
--
again
it's
a
motion
which
is
no
longer
used,
it's
the
common
law
motion
as
a
demurrer
to
the
evidence
at
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case,
this
is
in
effect
what
we
were
doing.
we
now
call
it
a
motion
for
acquittal.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes,
sir
it
would
have.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
right
sir
and
also
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
a
demurer
to
the
evidence
if
sustained,
would
not
run
the
risk
--
well,
a
demurrer
to
the
evidence
with
common
law
would
not
have
run
the
risk
of
finding
of
guilty.
this
has
been
our
custom
for
centuries.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
insofar
as
the
discharge
of
the
defendant
is
concerned,
yes.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
no
sir,
the
whole
import
of
rule
12
(b)
(1)
is
to
take
a
look
at
these
things
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
proceeding.
and
if
there
is
a
thorough
and
valid
defense,
no
issue
of
fact
involved
you
see.
there
is
a
thorough
and
a
valid
defense
available.
it
ought
to
be
considered
at
the
outset
and
if
this
results
in
the
discharge
of
the
defendant,
fine.
let's
dispose
off
the
matter
in
that
fashion.
if
it
does
not,
rule
12
(b)
(5)
says,
“his
plea
stands
and
you
proceed
if
necessary
for
the
trial.”
mr.
harry
a.
dower
no
sir,
under
rule
12
(b)
(1)
if
it's
--
and
12
(b)
(4),
it's
necessary
to
support
the
motions
to
dismiss,
you
can
file
an
affidavit
or
the
court
can
hold
a
hearing.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir,
as
occurred
in
this
case,
judge
sheridan
found
the
facts
in
the
selective
service
file.
he
didn't
make
a
formal
finding
effect.
you
know,
he
didn't
delineate
a
portion
of
his
opinion
in
this
fashion.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
oh
no
sir.
if
it's
purely
a
question
of
law
such
was
a
situation
in
the
brewster
case.
then,
i
would
say
that
the
1971
version
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
would
permit
an
appeal
because
there
has
been
no
fact-finding
process
commenced.
and
all
of
this
--
all
that
is
involved
is
a
question
of
law.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
alright
sir?
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
in
his
consideration
of
the
selective
service
file
which
is
the
entire
government’s
case.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
would
have
to
have
the
facts
before
him
sir
before
the
district
judge
--
mr.
harry
a.
dower
no
sir,
these
facts
are
not
on
the
docket.
the
selective
service
file
comes
in
the
evidence
at
the
trial
or
in
this
case
by
stipulation
--.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir,
but
this
was
in
consideration
of
the
entire
selective
service
file
which
came
into
him
by
stipulation
rather
than
impaneling
a
jury
and
then
having
stipulation
or
having
the
government
offered.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
his
decision
is
based
on
the
facts
which
he
found
from
the
selective
service
file.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir,
but
he
had
to
find
the
facts
first
which
were
not
a
part
of
the
judgment
rule
in
the
common
law
sense
were
not
a
part
of
the
indictment
and
these
were
the
things
that
were
necessary
for
him
to
determine
before
he
could
reach
his
conclusion
that
this
evidence
that
which
the
government
had
would
not
be
sufficient
to
convict.
now
that
the
white
is
on
--
i
would
just
offer
one
other
suggestion.
well,
i
will
just
repeat
that
i
think
that
are
too
often
courts,
lawyers
have
been
struggling
to
attach
a
label
of
acquittal
on
a
pre-trial
disposition
or
on
some
disposition
of
a
case
in
order
to
bring
into
the
common
law
rule.
this
is
no
longer
necessary
given
a
particularly
rule
12
(a),
12
(b).
mr.
harry
a.
dower
i
will
be
brief
sir.
i
respond
to
the
government's
position
in
reference
to
what
is
involved
in
jeopardy
by
saying
that
a
person
has
got
to
go
through
the
burden
and
expense
and
emotional
strain
of
a
trial.
i
think
this
is
reading
these
statements
in
the
cases
far
too
narrowly.
certainly,
many
people
are
terrified
upon
receiving
a
traffic
ticket.
the
emotional
strain
can
start
as
soon
as
that.
certainly,
when
a
person
is
indicted,
he's
going
to
go
through
a
lot
of
burden
and
expense
and
emotional
strain
too.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir
--
mr.
harry
a.
dower
first
time
it
would
occur
sir,
i
know
of
no
other
way
than
to
go
and
to
move
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
well,
i
should
think
that
thereafter
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue
the
case
but
thereafter,
civil
suit
for
damages
against
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
harry
a.
dower
no
sir,
except
the
integrity
of
prosecutor's
office.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
yes
sir,
i
must
concede
that.
unfortunately,
so
far
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
a.
dower
i
would
rather
relay
on
their
integrity
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
alright,
it's
inconceivable
that
a
person
could
get
to
that
position
being
so
ill
informed
but
sure
within
the
ambit
of
what
is
conceivable
--.
mr.
harry
a.
dower
i
should
hope
so.
i
would
just
say
that
once
again
i
sensed
that
the
government,
so
many
of
us
have
to
know,
you
just
but
too
much
emphasis
on
labels
and
that
we
really
ought
to
look
at
the
function
of
these
things.
what
is
a
trial
in
terms
of
the
burden
and
expense
and
emotional
strain?
it
doesn't
have
really
to
be
--
i'm
suggesting
that
jeopardy
in
that
sense
arises
well
before
a
jury
is
impaneled.
and
with
the
modern
methods
of
disposing
off
issues
before
a
court
prior
to
the
impaneling
of
the
jury,
we
don't
need
to
read
these
things
so
narrowly.
i
would
also
just
respond
to
the
closing
statement
made
by
mr.
korman,
in
reference
to
the
sophisticated
and
i
will
be
kind
--
the
sophisticated
defense
counsel
who
waits
until
a
jury
has
been
impaneled
to
bring
his
motion
to
dismiss.
he
says
that
this
court
by
its
rule
making
could
probably
require
these
motions
be
made
prior
to
trial.
i
would
not
be
so
hasty
to
conclude
that,
i
would
assume
that
a
rule
of
that
kind
would
require
a
great
amount
of
public
discussion
before
it
could
be
even
considered
for
adoption.
i
thank
all
of
you
your
honor.
