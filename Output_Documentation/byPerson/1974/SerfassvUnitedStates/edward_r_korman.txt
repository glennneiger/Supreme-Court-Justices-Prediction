mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
which
sustained
it’s
jurisdiction
to
hear
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
a
pre-trial
order
of
the
district
court
dismissing
an
indictment
on
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
also
reversed
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
or
other
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
its
opinion.
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
filed
here
did
not
in
anyway
challenge
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merits.
it
challenged
only
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
could
consistent
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
entertain
the
appeal
by
the
united
states.
before
getting
into
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
question
that
occurred
to
us
and
which
we
have
looked
into
and
that
is
the
availability
of
the
president’s
pardon
and
clemency
program
that
these
defendants
--
should
the
court
delay
its
decision
beyond
the
31st
of
january
of
1975.
and
we
have
been
told
and
counsel
for
both
mr.
jenkins
and
mr.
serfass
have
been
advised
that
if
they
wrote
to
the
respective
untied
states
attorney’s
offices
and
indicated
their
intention
to
unveil
themselves
or
their
desire
to
avail
themselves
of
the
alternative
service
program,
should
there
be
a
judgment
in
this
court
adverse
to
them.
they
could
preserve
their
rights
to
participate
in
the
alternative
service
program
even
if
they
ultimately
applied
for
it
after
january
31st
because
of
the
delayed
decision
of
this
court
which
might
be
adverse
to
them.
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
appeal
in
this
case,
there
are
really
two
issues
presented.
first,
the
issue
whether
the
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
appeal
from
this
order.
the
criminal
appeals
act
provides
that
the
united
states
can
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
a
decision
order
or
judgment
dismissing
an
indictment
in
a
criminal
case,
unless
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
bar
further
prosecution.
moreover,
in
order
to
overcome
the
restrictive
interpretation
that
had
been
placed
on
similarly
worded
earlier
criminal
appeals
act
which
had
limited
the
government’s
right
to
appeal
from
dismissals
only
where
the
dismissals
were
permitted
appeals
rather
only
where
the
dismissals
were
based
on
the
four
corners
of
the
indictment.
congress
deliberately
wrote
in
to
section
3731,
a
rule
of
a
liberal
construction
and
mandated
that
the
statute
be
liberally
construed
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
not
only
from
this
language
but
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
it’s
plain
beyond
any
doubt
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
appeal
in
question
here.
indeed,
at
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
an
excerpt
quoted
at
page
16
of
our
brief
observed
that
the
problems
of
appealability
have
become
especially
serious
in
selective
service
cases
where
judges
have
reviewed
defendant’s
selective
service
files
before
trial
and
dismissed
the
indictments
after
finding
that
there
have
been
errors
by
the
draft
boards.
these
are
issues
to
be
determined
by
a
judge,
not
a
jury
and
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
subject
to
appellate
review.
congress
not
only
was
concerned
about
all
pre-trial
dismissals
but
particularly
those
in
selective
service
cases
and
it’s
quite
plain
and
indeed
from
reading
petitioner's
brief,
we
had
assumed
that
he
had
conceded
the
issue
that
the
statute
quite
plainly
intended
to
authorize
the
appeal
from
the
pre-
trial
order
dismissing
the
indictment
in
this
case.
this
brings
us
then
to
the
second
question
that’s
presented
and
that
is
whether
an
appeal
from
this
order
is
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
in
this
connection
it's
worth
again
recalling
the
words
of
the
constitutional
provision
that
nor
shall
any
person
be
subject
for
the
same
offense
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb.
now,
while
that
term
has
a
certain
degree
of
vagueness
and
it's
never
been
given
a
completely
clear
and
fixed
definition,
one
thing
is
certain
from
every
case
that
is
ever
construed
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
constitution
and
that
is
a
person
is
not
placed
in
jeopardy
until
a
trial
has
begun
at
which
he
is
in
danger
of
having
a
judgment
of
conviction
entered
against
him.
and
until
that
time
has
come,
he
has
not
been
placed
in
jeopardy
and
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects
a
defendant
against
being
tried
that
is
being
placed
in
jeopardy
of
conviction
for
a
second
time
and
at
that
is
case
is
such
as
illinois
v.
somerville
made
clear,
the
guarantee
is
not
even
absolute.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
perhaps
would
depend,
i
would
assume
on
how
the
trial
ended.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
for
example,
there
was
in
this
trial
because
the
jury
was
unable
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
he
could
not.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
think
--
perhaps
i
answered
too
quickly.
i
would
think
that
he
could
be
indicted
again
but
he
could
never
be
tried
on
the
indictment
and
therefore
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
think
it
shouldn’t
be
done
and
probably
would
be
done
but
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it
could
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
burden
and
expense
of
going
to
trial
against
which
he
is
protected
and
the
bar
of
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
assume
that
he
would
have
an
arraignment,
a
valid
defense
the
indictment
on
which
he
could
move
to
dismiss.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it's
not
that
broad
if
he's
been
put
in
jeopardy
and
the
trial
was
ended
in
a
conviction
or
an
acquittal.
he
can't
be
put
to
the
trouble
and
expense
of
another
trial.
now,
obviously
if
he
can't
be
tried,
it
would
be
irresponsible
and
improper
to
indict
him
for
that
offense
and
he
would
have
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
don't
--
it
gets
after
a
while,
it
would
not
be
proper
for
him
to
be
tried
and
therefore
i
assume
from
that
that
it
would
not
be
proper
for
him
to
be
indicted
and
therefore
you
would
have
a
valid
defense
to
the
indictment.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don't
follow
that
part
of
your
honor's
question,
all
of
the
things
that
happened
to
the
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
what
i
meant
to
imply
by
the
latter
part
of
my
talk
that
protection
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
absolute,
is
that
a
person
can
be
tried
on
an
indictment.
the
trial
can
go
completely
to
the
end
and
both
sides
rest,
the
government
have
the
most
complete
opportunity
and
a
fairest
opportunity
to
prevent
this
case.
the
jury
can
split
11:1
for
an
acquittal
and
yet
the
government
can
retry
him
again
and
place
him
through
the
entire
burden
and
expense
of
the
trial
and
that's
all
i
meant
to
refer
to
by
that
the
latter
part
of
the
comment.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don't
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don't
know
that
it
means
two
different
things,
i
think
it
means
the
same
thing,
it
means
trial
and
in
one
instance
where
the
jury
has
been
unable
to
reach
a
verdict
after
a
full
and
the
governments
had
a
full
and
fair
crack
of
the
appellee,
i
am
confused
with
the
words
your
honor
quoted
in
(inaudible)
case.
the
government
can
still
have
a
second
crack
at
the
appellee
because
it
has
where
the
jury
has
been
unable
to
reach
a
verdict.
on
the
other
hand,
where
he's
been
acquitted
or
convicted,
that
guarantee
becomes
absolute
but
in
both
instances,
the
determination
as
to
whether
a
new
trial
may
ensue
is
essentially
based
on
questions
of
policy
and
questions
that
go
to
the
history
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
think
that
if
the
event
happened
that
is
the
second
indictment
were
brought
the
defense
would
be
to
dismiss
that
indictment
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy.
now,
whether
you
say
that
it's
how
--
i
think
it
becomes
after
a
point
that
material
was
to
how
you
characterize
or
whether
you
say
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
because
it
can’t
be
retried
and
it's
pointless
to
have
that
indictment
or
to
say
that
after
the
acquittal
even
the
indictment
itself
has
barred
us,
is
i
think
it
just
turns
on
a
language
he
used.
i
don't
think
it's
significant,
the
significant
part
is
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it's
the
double
jeopardy
clause
which
protects
against
a
second
trial
for
the
same
offense.
now,
my
adversary
is
suggested
that
there
are
no
firm
guides
in
which
to
instruct
the
court
and
how
to
proceed
in
this
case
which
involved
a
pre-trial
dismissal
and
we
would
suggest
that
there
are
at
least
a
hundred
years
of
precedent
to
this
court
to
guide
it
in
designing
this
case.
the
most
extinct
summary
of
the
law
in
this
area
was
stated
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
opinion
in
collins
versus
loisel
where
he
said,
the
constitutional
provision
against
double
jeopardy
can
have
no
application
unless
a
prisoner
has
there
to
for
been
placed
on
trial.
the
preliminary
examination
of
one
arrested
on
suspension
of
crime
is
not
a
trial
and
his
discharge
by
the
magistrate
upon
an
examination
is
not
an
acquittal.
even
the
finding
of
an
indictment
followed
by
arraignment
pleading
there
to
repeated
continuances
and
eventually
dismissal
at
the
instance
of
the
prosecuting
officer
on
the
ground
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
hold
the
accused,
was
held
not
to
constitute
jeopardy
and
this
principle
has
been
illustrated
in
numerous
cases
decided
by
this
court
under
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
which
permitted
the
united
states
to
appeal
to
this
court
directly
from
a
order
of
a
district
court
characterized
as
a
motion
in
bar
entered
before
jeopardy
has
attached.
and
this
court
consistently
held
in
construing
that
statute
that
where
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
to
trial,
he
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy
and
i
think
that
a
particular
significance
to
the
issue
here
are
the
cases
which
involved
appeals
to
this
court
for
motions
in
bar
which
sustained
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
defense
goes
to
the
general
issue
in
the
case
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
two
opinions
of
this
court,
a
pre-trial
ordered
dismissing
an
indictment
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds
was
characterized
as
an
acquittal.
nevertheless,
this
court
has
repeatedly
entertained
appeals
from
such
orders
because
the
defendant
had
not
been
placed
in
jeopardy.
the
most
recent
of
that
was
in
united
states
v.
goldman
in
which
the
issue
--
the
same
arguments
that
were
made
here
were
made
there,
that
was
an
appeal
from
the
dismissal
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds
which
goes
to
the
general
issue
in
the
case.
there
was
a
pre-trial
dismissal
and
this
court
rejecting
a
challenge
to
its
jurisdiction
stated
that
since
the
district
court
had
not
commenced
it
sitting
for
trial,
the
defendants
in
error
had
not
been
in
placed
in
jeopardy.
now,
the
defendant
of
course
concedes
that
in
fact
the
jeopardy
had
not
attached.
instead,
he
argues
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
acquittal
on
the
merits
that
constructively
jeopardy
has
attached.
and
this
argument
which
really
takes
us
to
the
first
of
the
court
of
appeals’
decisions
which
have
denied
the
government
the
right
to
appeal
from
pre-trial
orders
is
based
on
what
we
believe
to
be
a
serious
misconception
of
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
we
don’t
have
to
equival
all
the
terms,
we
can
concede
that
if
an
acquittal
is
a
termination
or
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
defendant
after
the
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
that
maybe
characterized
as
an
acquittal
and
that
a
pre-trial
dismissal
on
the
merits
maybe
viewed
as
an
analog
of
an
acquittal.
but
the
reason
that
a
defendant
cannot
be
tried
again
after
he
has
been
tried
once
and
acquitted,
is
not
necessarily
because
he
has
been
acquitted
but
because
he
has
been
placed
on
trial
and
been
put
in
jeopardy
of
conviction
once
and
so
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
force
and
protection
not
only
from
an
acquittal
but
a
conviction
and
even
protection
against
a
second
trial
where
the
jury
did
not
reach
a
verdict,
if
the
case
was
terminated
improperly
prior
to
verdict.
and
so
that
it
makes
little
sense
to
say
that
the
argument
that
this
is
somehow
an
acquittal
doesn’t
really
answer
any
question
at
all.
the
question
is
whether
he
has
been
placed
once
in
jeopardy
and
whether
if
the
government
is
successful
on
its
appeal,
he
would
be
placed
in
jeopardy
the
second
time
and
it
was
this
critical
distinction
which
we
believe
was
overlooked
for
example
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
united
states
against
ponto
which
has
become
the
leading
court
of
appeals
decision
on
this
issue.
there
in
excerpt
quoted
at
page
34
of
our
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
case
not
different
from
the
instant
case
said
that,
“since
the
dismissal
order
was
based
on
the
determination
on
the
merits,
it
was
an
acquittal
to
which
jeopardy
had
attached.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
in
the
green
case
which
is
one
of
the
cases
that's
cited
by
the
court,
mr.
justice
black
wrote
for
this
court
that
it
is
the
acquittal
which
ends
the
jeopardy
that
has
attached
at
the
commencement
of
trial.
it's
not
an
acquittal,
it's
not
jeopardy
which
attaches
to
an
acquittal.
moreover,
the
courts
of
appeals
continued
thus
government
appeal
from
this
ruling
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
since
a
re-trial
on
the
charge
would
be
prohibited.
but
when
was
he
tried
initially
on
the
charge?
the
court
of
appeals
never
address
itself
to
that
issue,
and
it's
not
surprising
that
of
the
five
judges
of
the
seventh
circuit
who
composed
in
majority,
two
of
the
five
did
not
even
join
in
this
reasoning
and
they
adopted
yet
another
analysis
which
the
ninth
circuit
has
also
subscribed
to.
and
they
said
that
since
this
was
a
dismissal
with
prejudice,
and
since
therefore
the
government
could
not
bring
a
second
prosecution.
therefore,
it
was
barred
from
appealing.
and
in
making
this
argument,
the
court
relied
on
the
opinion
of
this
court
“united
states
against
oppenheimer.
that
case
was
a
case
in
which
the
government
had
indicted
someone
for
violating
the
bankruptcy
act
conspiracy
that
committed
fraud
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
defendant
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds,
the
motion
was
granted,
the
united
states
never
appealed.
subsequently,
this
court
in
a
decision
had
redefined
and
clarified
the
law
in
the
area
and
it
was
plain
that
the
initial
determination
of
the
district
court
dismissing
the
indictment
was
an
error.
the
united
states
then
brought
a
second
indictment
against
the
defendant
and
he
then
alleged
that
that
second
indictment
was
barred
either
under
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
or
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
this
court
held
that
the
second
indictment
was
barred
because
the
failure
of
the
government
to
appeal
from
the
first
indictment
left
standing
on
the
record
a
final
order
on
the
merits,
and
that
the
civil
law
of
doctrine
of
res
judicata
applied
to
a
criminal
case
even
to
a
pre-trial
dismissal,
on
the
merits
where
the
government
had
not
appealed
but
sought
to
bring
a
new
indictment
the
defendant
could
in
effect
invoke
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
but
of
course
that
does
not
follow
from
that
that
the
government
could
not
appeal
from
the
initial
dismissal
of
the
order
and
of
course
in
united
states
versus
goldman
to
which
i
referred
to
afterwards
which
was
decided
after
united
states
against
oppenheimer.
this
court
entertained
an
appeal,
a
direct
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
and
indictment
on
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct
in
all
selective
service
cases
as
your
honor
may
be
aware
of
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
think
for
example
from
the
--
and
may
not
be
any
good,
as
long
as
the
judge
adheres
to
his
position,
and
would
dismiss
that
there
were
a
trial
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
he
was
found
to
be
wrong
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
determination
is
not
even
challenged
here.
i
agree
that
had
they
gone
be
to
trial
--
would
have
been
foolish
to
go
to
trial
with
the
judge
entertaining
the
erroneous
view
of
the
law
that
he
had,
but
that
doesn’t
necessarily
follow
from
that
that
the
defendant
was
placed
in
jeopardy
of
a
conviction
by
the
pre-trial
disposition
that
took
place
here.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it's
the
end
of
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
assume
that
the
judge
would
have
done
the
same
thing
and
that's
what's
problem
in
mr.
price'
case.
so,
where
that's
exactly
what
happened.
i
would
note
however,
that
judge
--
even
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
in
jenkins
suggested
that
if
a
defendant
had
available
to
him
a
defense
which
he
could
have
raised
before
a
trial
that
involved
no
disputed
issue
of
fact
and
deliberately
permitted
himself
to
be
placed
in
jeopardy
and
then
delayed
his
motion
in
order
to
gain
this
tactical
advantage
but
that
was
a
question
he
was
leaving
open
and
was
not
deciding
and
indeed
we
would
argue
if
we
were
faced
with
that
where
a
defendant
did
that
knowing
that
he
had
a
defense
available
to
himself
and
let
himself
be
placed
in
jeopardy
that
the
protection
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
should
not
be
accorded
to
him
but
that
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case.
so,
that
the
second
and
what
we
think
to
be
misguided
ground
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
of
(inaudible)
is
this
misunderstanding
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
that
is
because
the
doctrine
would
bar
a
second
indictment
where
the
first
indictment
was
dismissed
and
not
appealed
from.
therefore
for
some
reason
the
government
could
not
appeal
from
the
initial
pre-trial
dismissal.
yet
a
third
ground
which
was
suggested
by
the
courts
of
appeals
is
one
similar
to
that
suggested
by
mr.
justice
marshall
that
is
if
you
will
say
that
the
government
can
appeal
from
the
pre-trial
dismissal,
that
will
only
discourage
defendants
from
making
their
motion
prior
to
trial
and
they
will
only
delay
it
until
jeopardy
has
attached.
well,
of
course
that
whatever
merit
may
be
that
that
consideration
of
policy
however
doesn't
answer
the
question
here
since
congress
has
authorized
the
appeal
and
has
made
the
determination
of
policy
itself.
and
has
determined
to
permit
that
appeal
here
and
of
course
second,
if
it
does
become
a
problem,
this
court
either
through
its
rule
making
powers
of
congress
through
a
legislative
action
can
provide
and
mandate
that
these
motions
be
made
prior
to
trial
otherwise
they’ll
be
deemed
waived
as
is
true
now
with
motions
directed
to
the
defect
in
the
institution
of
the
prosecution.
so
that
essentially
the
finley
case,
the
united
states
against
finley
involved
policy
considerations
that
are
no
longer
open
to
this
court
to
consider
since
congress
has
decided
itself
that
it
wants
the
united
states
to
have
the
right
to
appeal
from
these
pre-trial
dismissals.
moreover,
there
really
isn't
any
reason
to
depart
from
this
long
line
of
precedent
to
overrule
any
number
of
decisions
of
this
court.
none
of
the
considerations
which
are
reflected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
are
really
applicable
here.
the
defendant
was
not
put
through
any
burden
and
expense
and
trauma
of
trial.
he
was
not
put
through
a
hearing
or
determination
of
fact
which
could
have
resulted
in
a
conviction.
all
that
occurred
here
was
little
more
than
the
argument
of
a
legal
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
good
deal
less
here
than
that
which
occurs
at
a
suppression
hearing
where
the
judges
actually
hear
evidence
where
they
make
the
determinations
of
credibility
and
where
their
decision
on
whether
to
admit
or
not
to
admit
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
could
very
well
be
decisive
of
the
case.
here,
all
that
took
place
was
an
argument
on
a
motion.
the
selective
service
file
of
course
is
contained
undisputed
facts
which
is
true
in
every
selective
service
case,
the
defendant
rarely
ever
disputes
that
he
failed
to
report
his
order
and
his
only
defense
can
be
based
on
something
that
maybe
in
the
selective
service
file.
so,
that
the
facts
were
never
in
dispute
here.
there
was
no
trial
of
any
issue
of
fact
and
the
defendant
had
not
been
placed
in
jeopardy.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
there
is
no
reason
to
deny
and
to
defeat
the
intent
of
congress
to
authorize
the
appeal
here
or
to
overrule
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
and
we
therefore
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
