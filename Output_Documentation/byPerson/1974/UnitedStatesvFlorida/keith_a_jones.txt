mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
consolidated
proceeding
that
resembles
in
several
respects,
each
of
the
two
immediately
proceeding
tidelands
cases.
like
united
states
against
maine,
this
case
presents
the
broad
constitutional
question
whether
the
separate
coastal
states
have
the
constitutional
right
wholly
independent
of
the
submerged
lands
act
to
exploit
the
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
and
like
united
states
against
louisiana
in
which
argument
was
heard
yesterday,
this
case
presents
number
of
narrower
statutory
questions
pertaining
to
the
application
of
the
submerged
lands
act
to
particular
coastal
area.
although,
the
preceding
arguments
have
discussed
at
some
length,
the
history
of
tidelands
litigation
in
this
court,
i
think
that
in
order
to
put
this
case
in
context,
it
would
be
helpful
briefly
to
recapitulate
that
history
here.
the
history
of
tidelands
litigation
has
two
strands,
one
constitutional
and
one
statutory.both
of
those
strands
are
interwoven
in
this
case.
constitutional
strand
begins
with
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
california
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
united
states
and
not
the
separate
coastal
states
had
the
right
to
exploit
the
seabed
resources
of
the
three-mile
marginal
sea.
that
principle
of
federal
maritime
paramountcy
was
confirmed
and
extended
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
in
this
court's
decisions
in
the
louisiana
and
texas
cases
in
339
u.s.
shortly
after
those
decisions,
the
congress
enacted
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
in
which
it
had
allotted
the
seabed
rights
of
the
territorial
sea,
generally
speaking,
to
the
separate
coastal
states
and
the
seabed
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
to
the
united
states.
the
atlantic
coast
states,
including
the
state
of
florida
now
claim
that
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
all
of
the
seabed
rights
of
the
outer
continental
shelf,
and
that
the
principle
of
federal
maritime
paramountcy
announced
by
this
court
in
california
was
wrong.
they
claim
that
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
are
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they
deny
the
states
the
right
to
exploit
the
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
however,
the
other
atlantic
coast
states
based
their
claim
on
british
maritime
history
in
colonial
maritime
history
as
we've
just
seen.
state
of
florida
however
bases
its
claim
not
on
such
history,
but
rather
upon
its
1868
constitutional
boundary.
since
the
claim
is
florida,
we're
so
different
from
those
of
the
other
atlantic
coast
states.
this
case
was
severed
from
that
of
united
states
against
maine
and
tried
separately
before
the
special
master.
that
is
the
background
of
what
might
be
called
the
constitutional
aspect
of
this
case.
the
statutory
aspect
of
the
case
derives
from
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
florida,
363
u.s.
121
that
the
state
is
entitled
under
the
submerged
lands
act
to
the
seabed
rights
within
its
historic
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
out
to
a
maximum
of
three
marine
leagues
from
the
coastline.
since
the
state
is
only
entitled
to
three
miles
and
not
three
leagues
in
the
atlantic
ocean,
this
court
retain
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
location
of
the
line
separating
the
atlantic
ocean
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
also
to
define
the
state's
coastline
in
the
gulf.
those
statutory
issues
where
consolidated
with
the
constitutional
issue
and
tried
together
before
the
special
master.
the
special
master
rejected
florida's
constitutional
claim
as
incompatible
with
this
court's
decisions
in
the
california,
louisiana,
and
texas
cases.
it
concluded
that
the
state
is
entitled
only
to
those
seabed
rights
granted
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
special
master
defined
the
line
separating
the
atlantic
ocean
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
as
a
line
running
due
north
from
cuba
to
the
dry
tortugas
islands,
the
outer
islands
of
the
chain
of
keys
and
then
following
along,
the
outer
curve
of
the
keys
up
to
the
mainland.
he
then
held
that
the
state
was
entitled
to
seabed
rights
out
of
three
miles
to
the
east
of
the
mainland
itself
of
the
keys
into
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
north
of
the
keys
and
west
of
the
mainland.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
key
biscayne
is
not
on
this
map.
it's
approximately
here.
that
key
biscayne
is
just
south
of
miami
beach.
this
map
i
might
say
is
it
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
this
map
is
a
trifle
misleading.
this
body
of
land
is
in
fact
the
key
largo
which
is
a
separate
island
that
it
separated
from
the
mainland
by
only
a
very
narrow
stream
of
water.
so
narrow
that
it
was
impractical
to
represent
it
on
the
map,
but
it
runs
right
along
here
so
that
the
mainland
in
fact
would
run
in
that
manner.
perhaps
the
principle
question
disputed
before
the
special
master
was
the
location
of
the
coastline
in
this
area,
north
of
the
keys
and
the
state
had
contented
that
a
line
running
from
the
dry
tortugas
up
to
cape
romano
on
the
mainland
mark
the
seaward
limit
of
its
inland
waters.
it
claimed
this
large
roughly
semi-circular
body
of
comparatively
deep
water
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
was
in
fact
the
historic
bay,
and
therefore
in
the
waters
of
the
states.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
it's
in
the
nature
of
the
about
a
100
miles.
the
scale
as
you
can
see
is
30
miles.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
30
nautical
miles.
so,
it
looks
like
roughly
100
nautical
miles.
the
special
master
rejected
that
contention
of
the
state
but
held
sua
sponte
that
the
eastern
portion
of
the
bay
marked
by
a
line
running
from
night
key
up
to
the
mainland.
the
east
cape
of
cape
sable
was
a
juridical
bay.
that
line
is
approximately
24
geographic
miles,
actually
a
little
bit
more
than
24
miles.
the
special
master
also
held
sua
sponte
that
the
outer
islands,
the
tortugas,
the
marquesas
and
the
lower
florida
keys
should
be
in
circle
by
baselines
and
he
denominated
the
waters
within
the
baseline
so
described
as
inland
waters
of
the
state.
the
state
here
accepts
to
virtually
every
one
of
the
special
master's
major
determinations.
the
united
states
accepts
only
to
the
use
of
closing
lines
and
of
baselines
in
the
area
of
the
florida
bay
and
the
outer
island
to
measure
the
submerged
lands
act
grant
and
to
mark
the
inland
waters
of
the
state.
i
turn
now
to
the
discussion
of
the
exceptions
made
by
the
parties.
i
will
take
up
first
the
issue
that
this
case
has
in
common
with
united
states
against
maine;
that
is
the
broad
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
state
possesses
a
right
to
exploit
the
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
without
regard
to
any
limits
imposed
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
other
atlantic
coast
states
in
united
states
against
maine
claimed
the
entire
outer
continental
shelf.
if
this
court
should
contrary
to
our
submissions
in
that
case
decide
to
overrule
the
california
decision
and
decide
the
case
in
favor
of
the
states,
florida
presumably
will
advance
similar
claim
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
but
any
issues
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
are
not
presented
here,
in
florida
in
this
litigation
claims
not
the
entire
continental
shelf
but
only
that
portion
of
it
within
its
historic
maritime
boundary.
that
boundary
even
under
the
states
rather
generous
description
encompasses
considerably
less
than
the
entire
continental
shelf.
historic
boundary
upon
which
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
pardon?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
the
continental
shelf
varies
in
width
from
as
little
as
six
miles
to
as
much
as
i
think
200
miles.
their
historic
maritime
boundary
even
at
most
generous
description
of
it
would
not
i
think
extend
more
than
30
miles
offshore
at
any
point.
so
that
at
least
at
some
portions
of
the
coast,
it
would
be
considerably
less
than
the
entire
outer
continental
shelf.
as
i
say,
the
historic
boundary
upon
which
the
state
relies
is
that
set
forth
in
its
1868
constitution.
now,
it's
a
good
deal
of
argument
before
the
special
master
as
to
the
actual
location
of
that
boundary
line
and
i
do
not
propose
to
renew
that
argument
here.
it's
discussed
at
length
in
the
special
master's
opinion
in
our
briefs
and
i
rely
upon
that
discussion
here.
one
reason
i
don't
discuss
the
actual
location
of
the
boundary
is
that
in
the
view,
we
take
of
this
case
the
state's
historic
boundary
as
largely
irrelevant
to
the
proper
allocation
of
seabed
rights,
that's
between
the
state
and
the
united
states.
i
would
say
however
that
both
parties
agree
that
at
least
one
point
along
the
coast,
the
area
of
water
between
the
marquesas
keys
and
the
dry
tortugas,
the
states
historic
boundary
did
extend
beyond
the
maximum
limits
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
so
that
even
under
the
more
restrictive
view,
we
take
of
the
states
historic
boundary.
they
would
if
this
court
decided
the
constitutional
issue
in
their
favor
be
entitled
to
some
seabed
rights
in
addition
to
what
was
granted
under
the
act.
but
that
fact
we
think
does
not
avail
florida
here.
in
the
first
place,
this
case
is
foreclosed.
the
states
constitutional
claim
is
foreclosed
by
the
california
decision.
this
case
is
on
all
force
with
the
california.
like
florida,
california
had
a
maritime
boundary
that
had
been
approved
by
congress.
this
court
held
that
that
congressional
approval
of
the
boundary
authorized
the
state
to
exercise
certain
local
police
power
functions
in
the
area
of
the
marginal
sea
encompass
by
its
historic
boundary.
but
that
those
functions
did
not
detract
from
the
federal
government's
paramount
rights
empower
over
that
area.
the
court
reasoned
that
the
united
states
had
acquired
the
seabed
rights
or
had
acquired
the
marginal
sea
in
the
exercise
of
its
foreign
affairs
and
defense
powers,
and
therefore
that
the
united
states
and
not
the
separate
coastal
states
where
entitled
to
the
seabed
rights
within
that
marginal
sea.
the
solicitor
general
of
the
preceding
cases
set
forth
our
reasons
why
this
court
should
adhere
to
its
california
decision
and
i
will
not
elaborate
upon
that
argument
here.
my
only
point
is
that
if
this
court
does
adhere
to
its
california
decision,
nothing
more
need
be
said
with
regard
to
florida's
constitutional
claim.
but
even
if
this
court
did
depart
from
its
consistent
pattern
of
tidelands
decisions
and
overrule
california
in
the
principle
of
federal
maritime
paramountcy
for
which
its
stands,
florida's
claim
would
still
have
to
be
rejected.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
1962
after
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
state
formally
relinquished
by
constitutional
amendment
any
claim
that
might
otherwise
had
to
seabed
rights
seaward
of
the
maximum
limits
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
that
1962
constitutional
amendment
replaced
florida's
1868
boundary
on
which
it
relies
here
with
a
more
clearly
defined
boundary
that
corresponds
precisely
with
the
maximum
limit
of
its
submerged
lands
act
grant.
that
new
boundary
would
mark
the
outer
limits
of
any
permissible
constitutional
claim
other
than
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
that
florida
could
make.
thus
there's
no
theory
of
law
in
this
case
under
which
florida's
claim
could
be
sustained.
therefore,
i
turn
to
the
questions
relating
to
the
application
of
the
submerged
lands
act
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
first
of
these
questions
might
be
stated
as
“where
is
the
gulf
of
mexico”,
or
more
precisely,
“what
is
the
line
separating
the
gulf
of
mexico
from
the
atlantic
ocean
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act?”
there's
really
very
little
to
be
said
on
this
question
because
the
evidence
is
essentially
all
along
the
federal
government
side.
it's
true
that
congress
in
enacting
the
submerged
lands
act
did
not
purport
to
define
those
two
bodies
of
water.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
what
congress
intended.
but
cartographers,
geographers,
explorers,
historians,
and
other
writers
have
all
agreed
that
the
line
running
due
north
from
cuba
to
the
dry
tortugas,
and
from
there,
following
the
outer
curve
of
the
keys
to
the
mainland
is
the
maritime
border
between
the
atlantic
ocean
and
the
gulf
of
mexico.
that
is
the
line
set
by
the
international
hydrographic
bureau.
that
is
the
line
fixed
by
all
geographers
and
cartographers
as
the
evidence
before
the
special
master
showed,
and
the
state
presented
absolutely
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
would
suggest
that
congress
intended
any
other
line.
indeed,
shortly
after
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
florida
legislature
itself
with
specific
reference
to
the
submerged
lands
act
stated
in
legislation
that
the
florida
straits,
straits
of
florida
there,
are
an
arm
of
the
atlantic
ocean,
not
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
as
the
state
claims
here.
it's
only
when
this
litigation
began
that
the
florida
legislature
realized
that
perhaps
it
had
acted
adversely
to
its
own
litigating
position
and
revoked
that
act
in
1971.
but
the
florida
legislature's
enactment
in
1955
is
clear
evidence
of
the
common
understanding
of
where
the
dividing
line
between
the
atlantic
ocean,
the
gulf
of
mexico
was
from
congress
enacted
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
florida
keys.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
refer
loosely
to
the
florida
keys
sometimes
as
the
entire
chain
of
violence
out
the
dry
tortugas
and
sometimes
only
to
those
islands
terminating
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
key
west
actually
is
right
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
these
are
the
marquesas
keys
and
then
the
dry
tortugas.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
if
you
decided
against
the
united
states
in
this
case
on
the
constitutional
question,
then
you
wouldn't
have
to
decide
the
dividing
line
between
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf,
that's
correct.
you
would
simply
make
reference
to
the
state's
historical
boundary,
and
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
as
to
its
historical
boundary
south
of
the
keys.
on
short,
we
believe
that
the
special
master's
determination
of
a
line
dividing
the
two
bodies
of
water,
the
atlantic
ocean
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
firmly
grounded
in
the
evidence
and
reflects
the
common
understanding
on
which
the
submerged
lands
act
was
based.
the
remaining
questions
in
this
case
all
relate
to
the
definition
of
florida's
coastline
in
the
general
area
of
the
florida
keys.
the
state
claims
that
this
large
body
of
water
marked
by
this
closing
line
is
a
historic
bay
and
it
is
inland
waters
of
the
state.
we
believe
that
it's
clear
that
there's
no
foundation
either
in
fact
or
in
law
for
that
claim.
to
the
contrary,
the
federal
government
has
affirmatively
and
decisively
disclaimed
any
historic
title
in
that
area.
before
this
issue
even
arose
in
litigation,
the
federal
government
had
distributed
to
foreign
governments
maps
showing
that
the
united
states
territorial
sea
in
the
area
of
the
florida
keys
was
measured
three
miles
out
from
the
natural
shoreline,
and
that
representation
of
course
was
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
existence
of
the
historic
bay.
necessary
inference
of
the
maps
which
we
distributed
was
that
united
states
claimed
no
historic
bay
in
that
area.
we
believe
that
in
--
that
a
disclaimer
of
that
kind
disclaimer
made
to
foreign
governments
in
advance
of
any
domestic
litigation
should
be
given
preclusive
effect.
we
think
that
in
the
face
of
that
disclaimer,
florida's
contrary
claim
was
barred
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
even
if
the
disclaimer
is
not
given
preclusive
effect
in
that
kind,
in
nevertheless,
imposes
upon
the
state
the
burden
of
proving
its
historic
title
is
clear
beyond
doubt.
the
standard
applied
by
this
court
in
the
second
california
case.
that
is
clear
that
the
state's
evidence
did
not
meet
that
standard.
under
this
court's
prior
decisions,
the
state
would
have
had
to
show
three
elements
to
prove
its
historic
title.
it
would
have
had
to
show
that
it
had
made
a
claim,
a
long
standing
claim.
second,
it
would
have
had
to
show
that
accompanying
that
claim
had
been
the
continuous
assertion
of
sovereign
authority.
and
third,
that
there
had
been
for
an
acquiescence
expressed
or
tacit
in
that
claim.
the
states
evidence
felt
for
short
for
making
any
of
the
three
necessary
showings.
as
to
the
existence
of
a
claim,
the
state
relied
almost
exclusively
upon
its
1868
constitutional
boundary.
but
the
special
master
found
that
that
boundary
in
fact
did
not
run
along
the
line
claim
by
the
state.
it
is
the
seaward
limit
of
its
inland
waters,
but
rather
ran
along
the
inner
perimeter
of
this
area,
and
that
construction
we
believe
is
based
upon
a
solid
reading
of
the
constitutional
language
of
florida's
boundary
upon
the
evidence
of
contemporaneous
activities
in
the
area
of
the
keys
adduce
before
the
special
master.
the
reasons
we
would
present
for
supporting
that
boundary
or
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
also
the
special
master's
report,
i
do
not
repeat
them
here.
it
suffices
to
say
that
if
this
--
if
that
construction
is
accepted,
florida's
claim
of
historic
title
is
necessarily
defeated.
moreover,
we
believe
that
florida's
evidence
with
respect
to
the
other
two
requirements
of
historic
bay
it
was
if
anything
even
weaker.
that
evidence
again
is
recounted
in
the
special
master's
report
and
in
our
briefs
in
this
case.
i
won't
repeat
it
here.
i
will
only
point
out
that
united
states
did
clearly
establish
before
the
special
master
and
the
state
concedes
here
in
its
brief
at
page
48
of
its
opening
brief
that
foreign
ships
have
fished,
do
fish,
historically
have
fish
and
do
fish
in
the
florida
bay
without
any
interference
whatsoever
by
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
he
may
have
but
any
such
excursion
was
unsuccessful.
it
was
the
state
itself
recognizes.
they
testify
that
they
had
never
attempted
to
interfere
with
foreign
fishing
in
the
florida
bay.
the
governor
may
have
threatened
to
do
that.
that
threat
may
have
been
--
made
in
connection
with
this
litigation.
nevertheless,
there
has
been
no
active
interference
with
florida
--
with
the
foreign
fishing
in
the
florida
bay,
and
that
fishing
continues
to
this
day.
certainly,
there
is
been
no
foreign
acquiescence
of
any
claim.
the
governor
kirk's
announcement
at
most
would
have
shown
that
there
was
a
claim
made
in
the
1960's
and
not
sufficiently
ancient
to
show
historic
title.
that
disposes
we
believe
of
the
states
historic
claim
in
this
case.
i
now
turn
to
the
status
of
the
eastern
most
portion
of
that
bay
which
we
feel
requires
a
somewhat
more
complex
analysis.
florida
did
not
contend
before
the
special
master
that
the
eastern
most
portion
of
the
bay
was
a
juridical
bay
and
almost
no
evidence
was
introduced
before
the
special
master
on
that
point.
the
special
master
nevertheless
found
that
a
portion
of
florida
bay
which
i
will
demonstrate
by
this
piece
of
red
tape
of
the
map,
that
the
portion
of
the
bay,
east
of
that
red
line
constitutes
a
juridical
bay,
and
therefore
inland
waters
of
the
states.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
official
maps,
i
frankly
don't
know.
i
gather
that
the
designation
florida
bay
is
rather
usely
--
loosely
used,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
particular
outward
limit
expressed.
the
graphic
department
of
the
justice
department
did
this
map
and
simply
put
the
designation
florida
bay
in
to
make
it
more
understandable
to
the
court.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
state
of
course
calls
the
entire
area
out
the
wider,
longer
redline
florida
bay.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
don't
think
they
designate
a
florida
bay.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
as
i
say,
it's
loosely
used
and
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
designation
would
be
or
where.
it
could
for
example
refer
to
this
portion
or
to
this
line
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
opposite,
page
84
in
the
special
master's
opinion
is
a
map
in
which
the
phrase
“florida
bay
appears
immediately
to
the
east
of
the
line
drawn
by
the
special
master.
and
whether
the
line
drawn
by
the
special
master
or
one
further
seaward
might
have
been
intended
by
that
designation
is
of
course
unclear.”
the
problem
of
course
is
that
florida
bay
as
such
has
no
official
meaning
and
no
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
a
coastguard
map.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
the
lines
drawn
on
the
map
are
--
were
evidence
before
the
special
master.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
can't
answer
that
specifically.
you
mean
in
the
area
east
of
the
juridical
bay
line
drawn
by
the
special
master?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
it
has.
part
of
that
area
has
historically
been
regarded
as
high
seas.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
actually,
i
think
the
--
i
believe
opposite
page
94
of
the
special
master's
(voice
overlap)
i
think
so.
yes.
the
solid
connected
line
on
that
map
represents
the
territorial
sea
and
the
dotted
line,
indention
dot
line
represents
the
juridical
bay
line
drawn
by
the
special
master.
as
you
can
see,
it's
seaward
in
some
places
of
the
territorial
sea.
thereby
encloses
part
of
the
high
seas.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
the
three-mile
marginal
sea
claim
by
the
united
states
as
its
territorial
sea.
seaward
of
the
three-mile
territorial
sea
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
it
is.
its
three
miles
from
islands
within
the
eastern
portion
of
the
bay,
though
some
of
those
islands
may
be
so
small
that
they
don't
show
up
on
the
map,
indeed,
some
of
them
maybe
areas
of
land
that
are
covered
at
high
tide.
nevertheless,
that
is
a
three-mile
zone
drawn
from
land
and
not
by
reference
points
that
are
wholly
covered
by
water.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
there
is
a
scale
on
this
map
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
let
me
try
to
determine
this.
i
think
that
roughly
speaking,
it
would
be
between
one
and
five
or
six
miles
from
the
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
from
the
three-mile
--
i'm
sorry.
what
was
the
question,
the
difference
between
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
this
is
--
again
set
forth
on
the
map
office
at
page
94.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
in
the
special
master's
report.
and
i
think
that
the
line
drawn
by
the
special
master's
at
all
points
within
six
miles
of
the
natural
shoreline.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
under
the
government's
position,
there
should
be
no
juridical
bay.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
marginal
sea
should
be
only
three
miles
from
the
shore,
that's
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
that's
right.
it's
not
entirely
accurate.
let
me
amend
that.
the
special
master's
closing
line
of
the
juridical
bay
is
utmost
about
six
miles
from
the
natural
shoreline,
but
--
then
the
territorial
sea
would
be
three
miles
further
seaward
of
that
line,
so
although
less
than
nine
miles
perhaps.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
for
reasons,
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment,
we
believe
that
the
special
master's
finding
the
juridical
bay
was
erroneous
that
before
discussing
that
point,
i
wish
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fundamental
and
clear
legal
error
that
the
special
master
made
in
drawing
the
submerged
lands
act
to
grant
from
the
juridical
bay
closing
line.
in
our
view,
that
line,
that
grant
has
to
be
drawn
from
the
natural
shoreline
of
the
state.
now,
we
rely
here
upon
this
court's
holding
in
united
states
against
louisiana,
389
u.s.
155
that
historic
boundaries
that
are
measured
from
the
coastline
such
as
florida's
boundary
in
this
area
must
be
measured
for
submerged
lands
act
purposes
from
the
historic
coastline.
and
it
is
clear
that
this
juridical
bay
closing
line
is
not
the
historic
coastline.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
389
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
155.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
actually
that
case,
maybe
a
misnomer
because
it
involved
texas.
there
are
a
number
of
states
but
the
claim
was
that
the
construction
of
a
jetty
a
new
coastline
and
that
the
historic
boundary
could
be
measured
out
from
that
jetty
and
the
court
held
that
no,
it
could
only
be
measured
from
the
historic
coastline
and
not
from
the
new
20th
century
coastline.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh!
i
apologize.
that
however
is
the
opinion
that
i
meant
to
refer
to.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
there
was
--
it
involved
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
what
i
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
that's
why
i
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i'm
not
certain
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
my
understanding.
i
may
have
gotten
my
numbers
confused
and
i
haven't
look
at
the
decision
for
sometime.
i
must
confess.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
believe
that's
irrelevant
to
the
determination,
the
submerged
lands
act
grant.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
only
in
this
case
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
but
here,
we're
saying
that
the
submerged
lands
act
is
only
measured
from
the
historic
coastline
when
you're
measuring
it
by
reference
to
historic
boundary.
and
i
will
go
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
not
always.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
you
would
measure
it
from
the
current
coastline
if
three
miles
from
the
current
coastline
was
further
seaward
than
three
leagues
from
the
historic
coastline.
now,
the
reason
that
this
juridical
bay
closing
line
is
not
the
historic
coastline
is
that
it's
based
upon
the
1961
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
in
a
contiguous
sum
which
first
permitted
the
24-mile
closing
line.
this
closing
line
is
roughly
24
miles,
actually
a
little
longer,
and
therefore
invalid
under
the
convention.
but
prior
to
1961,
this
nation
recognized
that
most
10-mile
closing
lines
for
juridical
bays,
and
in
the
19th
century,
they
recognized
only
two
marine
league
closing
lines.
a
closing
line
of
that
length
would
make
a
juridical
bay
approximately
in
that
area.
now,
the
historic
coastline
would
not
be
defined
by
reference
to
any
closing
line
such
as
that,
but
by
reference
to
the
natural
shorelines
of
the
islands
lying
to
the
west
of
that
closing
line
in
the
florida
bay.
now,
our
submission
here
is
that
the
states,
submerged
lands
act
grant
must
be
measured
by
reference
to
its
historic
boundary
which
in
turn
is
measured
by
reference
to
the
historic
coastline
and
not
to
any
new
modern
juridical
bay
closing
line.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
that's
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
principle
is
that
it
must
be
measured
by
reference
to
the
historic
boundary
which
is
determined
as
of
1868.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
special
master
do.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
because
that
line
was
based
upon
the
1961
convention
which
first
permitted
24-mile
closing
line.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
because
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
submerged
lands
act
only
permits
the
state
three
leagues
within
the
gulf
of
mexico,
within
its
historic
boundary.
so,
you
have
to
fix
the
historic
boundary.
to
fix
the
historic
boundary,
you
have
to
look
at
where
it
would
have
run
out
in
1968
from
the
coast,
and
you
measure
--
you
determine
the
coastline
in
1868
as
of
the
--
on
the
basis
of
the
principles
of
law
that
appertained
at
that
time.
the
principles
of
law
at
that
time
would
not
have
permitted
a
juridical
bay
closing
line
of
this
kind.
you
have
to
measure
the
coastline,
therefore,
by
reference
to
the
natural
shoreline
of
the
islands
and
measure
the
historic
boundary
from
that
natural
shoreline.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
all
of
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
all
that
line
represents
is
the
maximum
juridical
bay
closing
line
that
would
have
been
permitted
in
1868.
it
does
not
represent
the
historic
coastline
because
there
are
islands
further
west
of
that
line,
so
that
the
historic
coastline
would've
been
the
natural
shoreline
of
those
islands
further
to
the
west.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
unfortunately,
i'm
not
sufficiently
versed
in
the
detail
in
the
louisiana
case
to
be
able
to
answer
that,
but
i
think
that
--
oh,
i
can't
remember
now
which
bay
was
historic
and
which
was
juridical.
any
historic
bay
of
course
would
be
the
historic
coastline.
now
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
in
louisiana,
you're
only
measuring
three
miles
out
from
the
current
coastline
because
louisiana
has
not
established
the
historic
boundary.
therefore,
you
have
to
look
in
louisiana
at
the
current
coastline
and
measure
three
miles
from
that
line.
we're
here
concern
with
determining
the
historic
boundary
which
is
measured
by
reference
to
the
historic
coastline.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
discussion
is
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
discussion
is
at
pages
14
and
15
of
our
opening
brief.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
first
exception
is
that
there
is
no
juridical
bay,
that
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
true.
i
merely
showing
here
the
existence
of
the
juridical
bay
is
essentially
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
the
submerged
lands
act
grant.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
it
wasn't
because
no
one
contended
that
there
was
juridical
bay
of
this
kind
before
the
special
master.
that
determination
was
made
by
the
special
master
on
his
own
without
any
discussion
or
evidence.
that's
why
we're
having
this
difficulty
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we
also
object
to
the
existence
of
the
juridical
bay
for
the
international
legal
reasons
that
we've
set
forth.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
we
believe
that
there
should
not
be
a
juridical
bay
because
it's
inconsistent
with
the
position
we've
taken
in
foreign
affairs
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right,
but
we
don't
feel
that
the
court
should
grant
louisiana
inland
waters
and
thereby
that
the
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
certainly
hope
not.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
which
point
was
that?
oh!
yes,
he
measured
the
submerged
lands
act
grant
from
the
closing
line
of
the
juridical
bay.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
true.
because
as
i
say,
juridical
bay
closing
line
of
that
kind
was
not
contemplated
by
the
parties
before
the
special
master.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
there
was
not.
the
report
was
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
the
special
master
submitted
the
report
to
the
court
and
as
a
procedural
matter.
i
suppose
we
run
short
whether
we
couldn't
find
to
go
back
to
the
special
master
at
that
time,
that
the
report
was
in
for
this
court.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
suppose
he
wouldn't
have
to.
he
didn't
have
a
brief.
but
we're
saying
is
that
if
we've
been
able
to
make
these
arguments
before
the
special
master,
we're
certainly
wouldn't
found
the
juridical
bay.
i
made
just
one
point.
my
time
is
running
short
about
the
juridical
bay.
he's
used
a
chain
of
islands
as
a
defining
coastline
of
that
bay.
that
use
of
islands
is
impermissible
under
their
conventional
territorial
sea.
the
islands
are
separated
by
water
gaps
of
more
than
one
mile
in
width
which
are
navigation
channels
to
the
keys.
they
are
not
assimilable
to
the
mainland.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
the
historic
bay,
not
a
juridical
bay.
the
principles
are
different.
a
juridical
bay
relies
upon
the
technical
--
to
technicalities
of
the
conventional
and
the
territorial
sea
which
were
not
met
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
pass
on
quickly
to
the
last
exception
of
the
united
states
which
is
the
use
of
closing
lines
in
the
three
groups
of
outer
islands,
and
i
will
illustrate
that
by
reference
to
the
dry
tortugas
islands
which
are
here
on
this
map,
although
that
principles
of
law
are
basically
the
same
with
regard
to
all
of
the
islands.
the
special
master
drew
these
closing
lines
to
enclose
inland
waters
of
the
state.
the
effect
of
that
was
to
deny
foreign
navigators,
foreign
vessels,
the
right
to
sail
through
those
waters
and
they
were
designated
inland
waters
of
the
state.
that
use
of
baselines
--
well,
the
special
master
had
no
jurisdiction
to
use
baselines
in
this
fashion.
this
court
has
recognized
the
louisiana
boundary
case,
the
use
of
such
baseline
is
within
the
sole
discretion
of
the
united
states.
united
states
is
not
chosen
to
enclose
outer
islands
with
baselines,
and
the
special
master
had
no
power
to
do
it.
moreover,
the
use
of
such
baselines
is
inconsistent
with
our
position
in
foreign
affairs.
certain
island
nations,
indonesian,
the
philippines
for
example
have
enclosed
large
bodies
of
water
with
the
use
of
such
baselines
and
threaten
to
deny
foreign
navigation
right
to
these
waters.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
but
these
islands
are
not
that
close
together.
but
more
than
that,
only
if
they
are
close
to
the
mainland,
not
if
they
are
just
close
together.
islands
that
are
merely
close
together
are
not
entitled
to
baselines
unless
the
sovereign
determines
to
draw
such
baselines.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
we
are
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no.
we're
only
speaking
now
of
the
lower
florida
keys,
the
marquesas
keys,
and
they
dry
tortugas.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
he
didn't
encircle
those
in
the
same
way.
he
did
form
a
juridical
bay
there.
we've
already
oppose
that.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
and
in
so
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
certainly.
we
say
that
there
is
no
juridical
bay
there.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
the
islands
are
not
assimilable
to
the
mainland.
they
are
separated
from
the
mainland
by
a
series
of
water
gaps.
some
of
which
are
more
than
one
mile
in
width,
some
of
which
are
navigation
channels,
they're
simply
not
a
part
of
the
mainland.
the
only
time
this
court
has
permitted
the
assimilation
of
violence
to
the
mainland
was
in
the
louisiana
boundary
case
where
there
were
very
marshy
areas,
riddled
with
a
very
thin
and
possible
streams
of
water
where
it
was
impossible
for
practical
purposes
to
define
the
difference
between
the
mainland
and
islands;
that's
simply
not
the
case
here.
these
are
true
islands
separated
at
some
great
distance
from
the
mainland.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
three
miles
to
determine
that
territorial
sea,
yes.
our
position
is
that
the
coastline
of
the
state
is
determined
solely
by
reference
to
the
natural
shoreline
of
the
mainland
and
the
islands,
and
that
all
grants
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
it
must
be
measured
from
the
natural
shoreline,
and
that
the
territorial
sea
is
measured
from
the
natural
shoreline
that
there
are
no
substantial
bodies
of
inland
water
in
the
area
of
the
keys.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes.
certainly
as
to
islands
that
are
sufficiently
separated
from
the
mainland
not
to
be
assimilable
to
a
mainland.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
our
brief,
we
suggest
that
that
the
islands
down
to
upper
matecumbe
bay
--
upper
matecumbe
key
might
be
so
closely
assimilated
to
the
mainland
just
to
be
part
of
it.
those
islands
which
are
illustrated
in
the
map
are
separated
from
the
mainland
only
by
impassible
ribbons
of
water.
here
discussing
only
down
to
this
point.
in
fact
on
this
map,
it
appears
that
this
is
part
of
the
mainland,
it's
not.
it's
a
series
of
keys,
some
large,
some
smaller
which
really
are
so
closely
connected
to
the
mainland
or
so
close
to
the
mainland
as
for
practical
purposes
probably
to
be
part
of
the
mainland.
and
this
point
between
upper
matecumbe
key
and
keys
further
to
the
southwest,
there
are
water
gaps
which
are
wide
enough
some
over
a
mile
in
width
to
completely
separate
those
islands
in
our
view
from
the
mainland,
and
to
make
it
impermissible
to
draw
baselines.
but
i
would
further
add
that
baseline
running
down
along
a
chain
of
violence
would
serve
no
purpose
at
all.
it
would
not
enclose
any
body
of
water.
it
would
simply
deny
passage
between
the
islands.
that
would
serve
no
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
and
it
would
interfere
with
foreign
navigation
in
some
instances
with
no
counter-bailing
considerations
in
its
favor.
that's
the
problem
with
the
baselines
drawn
by
the
special
master
in
the
outer
islands.
it
serves
no
purposes
in
his
report.
the
florida
is
grant
of
under
the
submerged
lands
act
would
be
essentially
the
same
whether
you
use
baselines
or
not,
and
they're
merely
gratuitous
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
no
one
made
any
submissions
about
baselines
of
this
kind.
it
was
assumed
by
the
federal
government
and
the
state
made
no
contrary
contentions
that
there
would
be
no
such
baselines.
thank
you
very
much.
