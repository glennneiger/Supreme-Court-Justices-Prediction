mr.
jones,
how
would
be
the
approximate
length
of
a
line,
straight
line
drawn
from
the
dry
tortugas
to
cape
romano?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
governor
kirk
and
the
florida
navy
out
once
a
few
years
ago
have
copped
some
foreign
fishermen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
territorial
sea
with
to
that
map
you
just
come
out,
just
--
what
do
you
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
certainly
doesn't
seem
to
be
just
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
within
three
miles
from
dry
land.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
--
wasn't
an
entirely
accurate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
referring
--
you
say
louisiana
389,
do
you
mean
339?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
389
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
go
what
the
second
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
384
u.s.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
colleague
mr.
claiborne
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
colleague
mr.
claiborne
yesterday,
he
was
talking
to
us
about
ascension
bay
and
i
got
the
impression
of
the
thing
we
were
arguing
about
there
was
what
is
the
equivalent
of
the
low
watermark
for
purposes
of
the
measuring
the
grant
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
that
if
the
special
master's
finding
that
it
was
a
juridical
bay
where
upheld,
we
would
measure
from
the
mouth,
from
the
line
of
the
bay.
is
louisiana
different
than
florida
in
this
regard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
sua
sponte,
the
master's
job
was
to
answer
some
of
these
questions
decide
whether
they
were
juridical
bays
i
presume
and
did
he
have
to
have
a
brief
on
each
point
for
the
parties
before
he
could
draw
a
single
line
on
the
map?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
different
than
long
island
sound
which
we
were
told
you
that
they've
been
recognized?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
florida
keys
instead
of
running
southwest
from
northeast
to
southwest,
run
from
cape
biscayne
southeast
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
a
juridical
bay
at
all,
but
they
were
still
separated
by
the
same
water
that
they
now
are
between
cape
biscayne
and
key
west.
would
you
say
there
that
the
master
couldn't
draw
baselines?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
particularized?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
chief,
on
this
side,
i
think
if
mr.
jones
and
his
associates
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
attorney
general,
if
you
would
use
the
pointer,
maybe
we
could
see
over
on
this
side
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
attorney
general,
it
seems
to
be
--
just
advance
several
different
propositions
and
on
your
point
that
california
isn't
controlling.
in
california,
congress
had
recognized
the
three
mile
boundary
of
california.
at
the
time,
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1850
as
i
recall.
and
now,
i
take
if
the
government's
position
which
the
master
accepted
was
that
congress
is
recognition
of
florida's
1868
boundary
was
no
more
and
no
less
than
that.
now,
do
you
--
if
you
disagree
with
that,
why
do
you
disagree?
if
one
that
you
say
you
want
california
overrule
or
that
the
submerged
lands
act
have
changed
it?
but
insofar
as
arguing
that
you're
not
governed
by
florida,
why
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
based
in
on
the
submerged
lands
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
means
you
think
you
have
to
start
out
north
of
east
and
not
south
of
the
east?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
a
45-degree
call
northeast
from
the
dry
tortugas
bring
you
right
out
to
cape
romano?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
your
historic
bay
claim
separate
from
your
historic
boundary
claim?
they
bring
you
out
the
same
place
i
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
under
the
international
convention?
