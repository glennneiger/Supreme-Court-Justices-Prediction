mr.
attorney
general,
the
government
doesn't
agree
with
you
that
you
have
permitted
or
not
permitted
fishing
by
foreign
government.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
the
fact,
but
you
agree
that
it's
not
the
admitted
fact,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
prohibited
it,
foreign
governments
from
fishing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
what
means?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
shrimping
going
on
there
now
by
foreign
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
in
the
record
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that
you
admitted
that
it
had
been
going
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
government
said
that
in
the
record
florida
admitted
that
foreign
fishing
was
going
on.
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
only
point
is
that
if
is
that
clear
to
you.
