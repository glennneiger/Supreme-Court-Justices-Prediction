what's
the
lettering
right
about
straits
of
florida?
does
it
say
florida
keys,
is
that
what
that
says?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
key
west?
justice
potter
stewart
there.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jones,
on
the
maps
of
the
area,
you
have
--
are
they
similar
to
your
designation
there,
florida
bay,
you
have
there
just
the
eastern
most
point
or
what
are
they,
what
do
they
show?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
yes,
the
official
maps,
the
coast
and
geodetic
survey
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
did
--
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
florida
bay?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
be
any
of
those,
that's
the
reason
i
want
to
ask
what,
is
it
generally
consider
to
be?
you
may've
look
ways
--
the
eastern
coast
guard
there.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
one
involving
it
to
the
jetty.
i
thought
that
was
a
california,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
the
caption
of
the
case
is
united
states
against
louisiana
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
somewhat
misleading
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
written
by
justice
harlan
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
certain,
but
i
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
you
point
out
cape
florida.
justice
potter
stewart
instead
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
your
submission
that
that
is
what
--
that
that
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
your
submission
is
that
an
east
west
line
with
its
western
terminus
cape
of
florida
is
the
dividing
line
between
the
gulf
and
atlantic?
justice
potter
stewart
based
upon
the
bottom,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
right
there,
not
be
a
difference
between
northeast
and
northeastwardly?
justice
potter
stewart
northeast
is
as
you
correctly
say,
a
very
definite
course
of
45
degrees,
northeastwardly
means
more
about
40
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
more
or
less
northeast.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
wouldn't
allow
--
the
1953
law
doesn't
give
you
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
you're
right.
