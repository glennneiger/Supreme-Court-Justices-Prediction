its
nautical
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
at
seaward,
how
much
less?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

just
at
seaward,
how
much
less?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
prepared
this
map?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
coastguard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
superimposed
or
anything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
distance
from
what
the
government
--
so
as
i
gather
natural
shoreline
in
the
master's
redline,
much
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
shoreline?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
the
shoreline
to
the
master
--
where
you
drawn
that
smaller
red
line
with
the
master
to
making
it
a
juridical
bay.
what
i'm
really
getting
at
is
on
the
government's
submission,
the
marginal
sea
ends
where
within
the
line
that
the
master
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
94?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
where
the
government's
submission
is
that
it
should
not
belong
to
the
three
--
more
than
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
the
marginal
sea
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
master's
line
takes
at
six
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
again,
mr.
jones.
i
now
have
the
other
case.
in
389,
well
that's
what
mr.
justice
black
wrote
this
one
and
that
one
held
that
texas
claim
under
the
three-league
grant.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
must
be
measured
by
the
boundary
which
existed
in
1845
when
texas
entered
the
union
and
cannot
be
measured
from
artificial
jetties
built
along
thereafter.
now,
you
apply
that
principle
here,
how
to
say
that
must
be
measured
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore,
it
cannot
be
measured
from
a
line
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
special
master
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you're
--
we're
governed
here
by
the
language
of
the
1953
statute
that
congress
enacted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
is
this
different
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
louisiana
boundary
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
argument
support
of
--
you
have
one
of
two
exceptions
to
the
united
states,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
this
argued
before
the
special
master?
i
assumed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
reason
you
didn't
go
back
to
the
master
and
asked
him
to
reconsider?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
another
question
that
was
not
argued
before
the
special
master.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
using
the
other
one?
the
one
the
government
used.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
if
you
were
right
on
that
point
and
also
right
on
the
historic
bay,
would
you
--
a
three
leagues
begin
from
that
long
line
than
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
don't
understand
if
you're
right
on
your
historic
bay
argument.
why
it
is
you
can't
go
from
that
line,
nine
leagues
into
the
gulf?
i
mean
three
leagues
in
the
gulf.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
a
historic
bay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
coastline
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you'd
measured
three
leagues
in
that
line
would
you?
