justice
byron
r.
white
we
decided
against
you
on
the
constitutional
question
would
be
--
have
this
issue
as
to
where
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
still
go
--
quite
understand
that
the
government's
point,
do
you
think
the
--
whether
that's
a
juridical
bay
or
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that's
generally
true
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
just
because
of
florida?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
had
the
understanding
the
generally,
you
would
measure
the
marginal
sea
from
the
outer
line
of
a
juridical
bay.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
under
the
submerged
lands
act
that
time
is
you
do
measure
it
from
the
historic
boundary?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
always?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
measure
it
from
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
jones,
where
to
do
i
point
this
discussion
in
your
brief?
on
this
first
point,
do
you
think
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
your
first
exception
to
the
support
of
special
master
was
that
--
what
should
be
the
finding
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
in
support
of
the
first
exception,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
would
have
thought
you
would've
--
you
wouldn't
be
objecting
to
which
as
it
in
the
first
instance
to
his
finding
the
juridical
bay
that
--
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
only
include
on
your
present
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
would,
it's
irrelevant
for
setting
the
lines?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
is
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
special
master
hasn't
tested
the
points
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
isn't
(inaudible)
that
that
was
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it's
what
the
special
master
has
included
that
that's
the
boundary
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
islands
were
very
close
together
and
imperceptivity
apart,
you
would
think
they'd
be
quite
alright?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
since
it
was
there
all
they
way
up
to
keys
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
florida
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
you
make
the
same
position
on
that
of
key?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
keys
do
form
the
south
side
of
the
--
suppose
juridical
bay.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
challenge
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
but
do
you
challenge
it
on
the
grounds
that
the
islands
themselves
are
not
part
of
the
mainland
and
should
not
there
for
--
do
not
therefore
bound
the
bay.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
if
they
followed
your
course,
you
would
just
go
out
three
miles
from
the
actual
coastline
on
each
of
those
islands?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
be
able
to
see
that
to
your
honor.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can't
see
it
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
if
you
are
right
on
the
historic
bay
there
in
florida
bay,
your
rights
in
the
seabed
would
be
--
would
stop
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
your
historic
boundary.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
would
not
be
true
of
you
--
of
your
--
on
the
entire
gulf
side
with
respect
to
your
historic
boundary.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
what
about
all
of
the
west
coast
of
florida?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
west
--
the
west
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
west
coast.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
i
still
--
if
we
held
for
you
on
the
constitutional
issue,
it
seems
to
me
you
get
out
to
your
historic
boundary
and
we
don't
have
a
problem
about
it
where
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
--
