me
so
that
it's
clear?
chief

a
clear
view.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
if
you
move
to
the
your
right
mr.

your
stage
props
are
all
ready
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
you
made
that
statement
about
walking
from
key
biscayne
to
key
west
there's
something
you
want
to
do,
take
that
long
walk,
is
that
in
evidence
in
the
master's
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
before
you
go
on
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
would
you
take
your
pointer
at
least
for
me
and
show
me
where
on
a
north's
--
where
you
would
draw
on
north-south

you
were
talking
about
that
would
separate
the
gulf
from
the
atlantic.
chief

e.

can
you
see
now
mr.

now
open

foreign
shipping
and
foreign
fishing
back
to
the
new
line
that
the
master

drawn

a
very
much
smaller
bay,

then
suggest
that
that
will
open
up
that
whole
area
to
potential
conflicts
between
the
state's
efforts
to
police
it
or
will
the
state
be
entirely
out
of
policing
that
large
area?
