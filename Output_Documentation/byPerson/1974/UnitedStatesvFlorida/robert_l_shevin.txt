mr.
robert
l.
shevin
this
is
not
mounted.
it
wouldn't
stand
on
the
other
easily.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
sorry
for
the
confusion.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
the
water
gaps
that
mr.
jones
refers
to
of
a
mile
between
the
keys,
i
would
point
out
that
most
of
those
are
more
than
two
feet
deep.
there
are
couple
of
six
and
seven
foot
channels,
but
there
was
testimony
presented
before
the
special
master
that
one
could
begin
walking
at
key
biscayne
and
walked
the
entire
distance
to
key
west
during
low
tide.
so,
we're
not
talking
about
substantial
water
gaps
of
depth.
secondly,
what
counts
is
what
was
the
historical
setup
of
this
land
in
1868
and
the
maps
that
where
presented
in
the
record
indicate
that
this
was
one
mass
of
land
with
very
little
separation
in
1868
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
mudflats
from
the
key
biscayne
all
they
way
to
key
west.
i
would
also
point
out
that
what
indonesia
and
the
philippines
do
with
regard
to
their
islands
is
totally
immaterial
to
this
boundary
dispute
and
we
should
not
be
bound
in
the
dispute
with
the
federal
government
over
what
will
happen
in
the
indonesia
or
the
philippines.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
it
is.
there
is
evidence
and
we
have
maps
from
the
1700s
that
show
this
entire
massive
land
and
mudflats
without
hardly
any
separation
at
all
between
the
keys.
with
regard
to
the
exercise
of
sovereign
power
by
the
state
in
florida
bay,
may
i
remind
the
government
that
in
1964,
they
supported
us
in
the
barrios
case
which
came
to
this
court
where
we
prosecuted
two
cuban
fishermen
for
the
violation
of
our
state
fishing
laws
and
the
government
filed
the
brief
in
favor
of
our
exercise
of
sovereign
jurisdiction.
i
would
also
point
out
in
response
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
powell
that
foreign
fishing
has
not
been
allowed
in
the
eastern
portion
of
florida
bay
and
it
has
not
been
allowed
in
this
entire
portion
on
a
historical
basis.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
1962
florida
constitutional
amendment
which
they
refer
to
as
a
waiver
of
the
state's
rights
was
not
approved
by
the
congress.
so
therefore,
it
cannot
constitute
a
waiver
florida's
historical
boundary
and
1868
is
our
only
lawful
boundary
because
that
was
the
only
boundary
approved
by
the
congress.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
1962
amendment
to
the
constitution
in
florida
cannot
be
anymore
effective
as
far
as
hurting
us
than
the
1968
amendment
could
in
helping
us
because
in
the
1968
amendments
of
the
florida
constitution,
it
readopted
almost
verbatim
the
1868
boundary.
so,
what
we're
left
with
is
that
the
only
lawful
boundary
of
the
state
of
florida
is
the
1868
boundary.
with
regard
to
the
1955
statute
that
was
passed
by
the
state
of
florida
which
mentioned
gratuitously
that
the
straits
of
florida
were
located
in
the
atlantic
rather
than
in
the
gulf,
and
here
the
straits
of
florida.
with
regard
to
that,
i
would
point
out
that
this
statute
was
passed
by
the
legislature
in
response
to
the
submerged
lands
act.
it
certainly
cannot
affect
what
is
based
on
expert
testimony,
and
that
is
marine
geology
and
sedimentology.
the
testimony
is
clear
that
this,
it
is
a
gulf
area
and
that
this
is
the
atlantic,
and
the
gulf
and
the
atlantic
are
separated
at
cape
florida.
in
affect,
the
lighthouse
at
cape
florida
separates
the
gulf
and
the
atlantic.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
cape
florida
is
located
right
about
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
here
is
key
biscayne
and
cape
florida
would
be
the
tip
right
about
here.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
it's
a
25
degrees
and
40
minutes.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
when
you're
part
with
contention
your
honor,
it
is
at
the
straits
of
florida
and
the
entire
keys
are
located
with
gulf
of
mexico.
we
have
drawn
the
line
where
we
contend
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
separate.
the
master
in
his
finding
said
basically
that
everything
north
of
the
tortugas
is
gulf.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
everything
south
is
atlantic.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir.
and
we
contend
that
the
record
is
clear.
we
have
sufficient
testimony
and
i'm
going
to
get
into
the
testimony
and
point
out
why
the
testimony
of
the
government
is
inadequate
on
this
point.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
this
red
line
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
this
red
line
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
throughout
this
matter,
the
red
line
indicates
what
the
state
of
florida's
position
as
the
black
line
indicates
what
the
master
found
which
is
pretty
consistent
with
what
the
government
put
forth
in
their
case
with
the
exception
of
the
juridical
bay.
basically
where
we
differ,
we
differ
very
slightly
here
and
i
don't
even
intent
to
argue
the
atlantic
coastline.
i
intend
to
argue
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
separation.
the
question
of
florida
bay
which
we
contend,
we
agree,
we
don't
think
it's
a
juridical
bay.
we
think
it's
a
historic
bay
and
we
think
the
historic
bay
goes
on
the
45-degree
angle
from
the
tortugas
to
nine
miles
or
three
leagues
off
the
coast
of
florida,
and
we'll
get
into
that
in
just
a
moment.
so
basically,
this
is
the
red
line
which
encloses
what
we
contend
is
all
of
florida
bay
and
we
will
show
that
historically.
we
have
exercise
sovereign
jurisdiction
over
that
entire
area.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
from
here?
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
just
a
few
miles,
your
honor.
it'd
be
a
matter
of
about
--
i
think,
it's
about
10,
20,
10
to
20
miles
at
the
most.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes.
it's
based
upon
the
bottom
that
if
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
if
you
empty
the
bottom,
it
would
drain
into
the
gulf
because
and
we've
also
got
testimony
with
regard
to
the
organisms
in
that
area
and
with
regard
to
the
sedimentology
and
the
geology
of
that
area.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
1955
statute
which
was
a
response
as
submerged
lands
act
certainly
cannot
affect
where
that
line
is
based
upon
expert
testimony.
addition
to
which,
that
statute
was
repealed
so
that
legislature
obviously
has
no
further
position
or
opinion
on
the
location
of
the
florida
straits.
with
all
due
respect,
i
would
disagree
with
mr.
jones
in
his
answer
to
you
mr.
justice
white
because
you
said
if
you
ruled
against
the
government
on
the
constitutional
issue,
would
you
still
need
to
decide
the
boundary
line?
i
think
you
would
because
it
would
still
be
a
difference
of
whether
we're
entitled
to
three
leagues
or
three
miles
on
the
gulf
side
and
you
got
to
decide
where
does
the
gulf
and
where
does
the
atlantic
begin
in
order
to
reach
that
question.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
here?
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no
sir.
we
believe
that
in
this
instance,
the
boundary
line
and
the
coastline
would
be
the
same.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
we
were
not
given
additional
three
leagues
on
top
of
that,
nor
have
we
contended
so.
i
would
also
strongly
agree
with
the
master
on
where
the
1868
boundary
is
and
of
course,
that's
the
crux
of
this
issue.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
because
that
is
our
historic
boundary
and
it
will
always
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
sir
because
on
the
entire
gulf
side,
our
historic
boundary
would
be
in
effect
a
three-league
line.
it
would
--
it
is
the
same
as
the
three-league
line,
our
historic
boundary.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
this
is
approximately
historic
boundaries
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
--
approximately
three
miles
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
on
west
coast,
here,
it's
a
three-league
line
and
both,
the
master,
the
federal
government
and
the
state
are
in
agreement
that
this
does
constitute
a
correct
reading
of
the
historic
boundary.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well
your
honor,
in
--
yes,
i
guess
that
that
would
be
true,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
i
guess
that
would
be
true.
if
you
determine
that
that's
our
historic
boundary
was.
the
importance
of
this
case
to
americans
living
thousands
of
miles
away,
we
contend
will
not
be
known
for
a
long
time
because
we
think
that
the
impact
of
this
case
would
be
very
great.
already,
florida
bay
which
is
the
area
in
question
produces
half
of
our
$16
million
year
fishing
industry.
at
present,
the
area
is
protected
by
the
florida
marine
patrol.
if
the
master
is
upheld,
this
entire
fishery
would
become
international
waters
and
would
probably
have
no
police
protection
whatsoever.
we
would
like
to
comment
that
for
many
years,
the
government
has
had
we
consider
a
general
policy
of
trying
to
chip
away
at
the
rights
of
the
state
in
our
marine
areas,
and
this
policy
has
taken
the
form
of
nibbling
away
at
states
sovereignty.
this
case
we
think
presents
an
excellent
opportunity
for
the
court
to
reverse
this
trend
and
to
recognize
that
the
states
have
a
value
in
being
able
to
give
local
knowledge
and
direct
interest
in
protecting
these
vital
natural
resources.
a
police
force
already
on
line,
train,
knowledgeable
and
particularly
equip
to
patrol
this
area
and
vigorous
enforcement
with
proper
respect
for
international
commitments.
i
would
point
out
your
honor
that
the
conduct
of
international
affairs
is
your
honors
is
not
at
issue
here.
the
rights
between
the
state
sovereign
and
the
federal
sovereign
are
at
issue.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
florida's
ownership
of
florida
bay
or
exercises
of
sovereignty
in
florida
bay
has
ever
embarrassed
or
interfered
with
the
federal
government's
conduct
of
foreign
affairs.
time
and
time
again,
the
master
we
think
wrongly
turn
to
international
law
to
decide
what
properly
is
a
purely
municipal
matter.
this
is
a
case
of
domestic
law.
it
arises
we
think
from
a
somewhat
misguided
effort
on
the
part
of
the
federal
executive
to
veto
congress
by
litigation.
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
recognize
the
usefulness
and
the
detrimental
effect
that
the
executive
branch
of
government
has
in
spending
great
sums
of
money
in
this
litigation
to
ask
the
federal
judiciary
to
proclaim
what
the
president
or
the
department
of
justice
or
the
state
department
feels
his
best
as
to
where
the
boundaries
of
the
state
should
be
located.if
mr.
attorney
general,
if
the
large
bay
that
is
the
one
with
the
100-mile
opening,
the
one
that
you
claim
is
an
historic
bay.
we
claim
that
it's
a
historic
bay
and
we
claim
that
it
is
the
historic
boundary.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
if
the
master
is
correct,
then
the
historic
boundary
of
the
state
is
along
with
this
area,
then
we
would
feel
that
this
entire
florida
bay
area
would
be
considered
international
waters
and
that
we
would
have
no
jurisdiction
for
policing
any
of
that
area
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
great
amount
of
the
shrimping
industry
in
florida
is
located
in
that
specific
area.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
of
the
shipping,
of
the
fishing?
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
about
half
of
the
$16
million
industry
is
located
in
that
area.
we
would
also
point
out
and
we
have
--
i
hope
to
get
to
this
at
some
point
in
time.
the
state
has
issued
a
number
of
oil
business
since
1941
in
this
entire
area
which
has
never
been
questioned
before
and
large
companies
have
been
drilling
for
oil
in
that
entire
area
over
the
past
30
to
35
years.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
it's
not
the
admitted
fact,
but
i
hope
to
get
into
some
of
the
specific
testimony
which
will
point
out
that
there
has
been
an
acquiescence
by
foreign
governments
in
the
sovereign
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
state
in
that
entire
area
over
a
long
period
of
time.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
we
have,
whenever
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
we
have
the
marine
patrol
that
polices
that
area
that
federal
government
entered
into
a
treaty
with
cuba
in
1957,
and
during
the
pendency
of
that
treaty
which
we
asked
the
federal
government
entered
into
a
cuba
because
there
had
been
shrimping
--
shrimping
that
was
occurring
in
the
tortugas.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
not
to
our
knowledge,
not
to
our
knowledge.
that
treaty
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
there
was
two,
two
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
there
were
two
cuban
fishing
vessels
that
came
into
the
area
in
1971.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
don't
think
that
statement
standing
alone
is
correct,
no
sir.
i
think
there
had
been
occasions
of
foreign
ships
going
in
the
area
and
wherever
possible,
the
police
has
tried
to
exercise
its
police
power
to
keep
them
out.
and
there
had
been
a
couple
of
arrest
occasionally,
usually
of
cuban
fishermen
within
that
area.
there
was
two
arrest
back
in
1971
and
the
coastguard
were
called
in
to
assist
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
let
me
comment
if
i
may
on
united
states
versus
california,
of
course,
the
overturning
of
that
case
is
sought
by
the
states
in
original
35.
i
agree
with
them
that
the
case
was
wrongly
decided
in
overlooking
at
least
a
100
years
of
case
law
and
i
think
its
full
amended
great
misunderstanding.
but
the
point
that
i
wish
to
make
with
regard
to
florida's
case
as
its
relates
to
california
is
not
so
much
that
it
was
wrongly
decided
but
that
it
does
not
apply
in
the
way
the
master
used
it.
our
question
is
simply
“where
did
congress
permit
florida
to
have
our
boundary
in
1868?”
even
though
mr.
jones
states
that
this
is
identical
to
california,
we
disagree
with
him.
they
are
not
identical.
california
went
off
on
the
summary
judgment.
there
was
no
evidence
put
in
the
record.
california
did
not
decide
where
the
historical
boundary
of
california
is
or
was
or
whether
they
had
a
historical
boundary.
unlike
california,
florida
has
been
declared
already
in
original
action
9
in
1960
to
possess
a
historic
marine
boundary
as
described
in
the
1868
constitution
in
excess
of
three
marine
miles.
also,
it's
our
position
that
the
submerged
lands
act
by
congress
was
clearly
a
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
california,
and
in
effect
vitiated
california.
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
congress
confirmed
their
quick
claim
title
to
the
states,
to
the
seabed
beneath
the
navigable
waters
within
the
states
boundaries
and
to
the
natural
resources
within
such
lands
and
waters
up
to
three
miles
and
gave
the
states
the
right
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
marine
seaward
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
because
we
think
that
the
facts
in
california
are
not
identical,
that
it's
a
different
situation
that
this
court
never
decided
where
the
california
had
a
historical
boundary.
and
in
this
case,
you've
already
--
the
court
has
decided
in
original
9
that
florida
does
have
a
historic
marine
boundary
that
give
us
rights
beyond
three
miles.
and
subsequent
in
other
words,
it's
our
position
that
the
submerged
lands
act
since
it
very
clearly
states,
nothing
shall
be
taken
to
prejudice
the
rights
of
any
state
to
establish
a
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
and
then
this
court
in
united
states
versus
louisiana,
the
363
u.s.
page
1
decision,
this
court
said,
“it
was
suggested
that
mississippi
and
alabama
might
claim
boundary
six
leagues”,
which
of
course
is
an
excess
of
three;
six
leagues
in
the
gulf
because
of
similar
provisions
and
the
acts
admitting
them
to
the
union.
he
went
on
to
say
and
this
justice
harlan,
“it
was
recognize
that
if
the
legal
existence
of
such
boundaries
could
be
established,
they
would
clearly
entitle
the
respective
states
to
submerge
land
rights
to
that
distance
under
an
application
of
the
pollard's
rule
to
the
marginal
sea.
hence,
while
a
three-mile
boundary
was
expressly
confirmed
for
all
coastal
states,
the
rights
of
the
gulf
states
to
prove
boundaries
in
excess
of
three
miles
was
preserved.
now
surely
in
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
it
is
saying
in
effect
that
the
submerged
lands
act
quick
claim
to
the
states
confirm
title
but
gave
the
states
every
right
to
come
in
and
try
to
prove
that
they
have
a
historical
boundary,
even
if
they
went
six
leagues.
now
obviously,
this
historical
boundary
that's
located
out
in
the
--
the
historical
boundary
that's
located
out
in
florida
bay
would
be
in
excess
of
three
leagues.
so,
we
are
dealing
with
the
nearly
an
excess
of
three
leagues.
so,
it's
our
contention
that
we
have
ownership
interest
and
the
disputed
area
off
of
our
coastline,
it's
our
contention
that
the
rule
of
pollard's
lessee
should
apply
and
that
the
extent
of
our
jurisdiction
was
declared
in
the
early
of
u.s.versus
florida
position
to
be
that
which
we
have
in
1868
as
described
in
the
state
constitution
of
that
date
and
approve
by
the
congress.
we're
not
here
contesting
work
powers,
we're
not
here
challenging
the
federal
government's
right
over
interstate
of
foreign
commerce,
we
are
not
questioning
who
conducts
our
international
relations,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
florida
cannot
control
the
seabed
of
its
own
territory.
florida
should
retain
eminent
domain
over
the
shores
of
her
territory
and
over
the
submerged
lands
that
are
here
in
question.
we
have
accepted
to
several
particular
points
in
the
master's
finding.
one
of
these
important
points
regards
the
location
--
thank
you.
one
of
these
--
i
broke
my
pointer.
one
of
these
important
points
regards
the
location
of
the
historical
boundary
between
the
southern
most
key,
the
dry
tortugas
and
cape
romano.
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
call
in
the
constitution,
and
that
is
from
the
tortugas,
you
go
thence
northeastwardly
to
a
point
three
leagues
from
the
mainland,
thence
northeastwardly
to
a
point
three
leagues
from
the
mainland.
now,
the
master
has
concluded
that
that's
only
a
general
overall
direction
and
he
in
effect
has
said
that
you
first
go
east
and
then
you
even
go
southeast
before
you
start
and
you
follow
a
three
fathom
line
to
a
northeastwardly
fashion
until
a
point
nine
nautical
miles
as
reach.
now,
it's
our
view
that
this
construction
is
so
illogical
and
contrary
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
as
to
the
ludicrous.
florida
contends
that
the
call
thence
northeastwardly
to
a
point
three
leagues
from
the
mainland
can
only
mean
one
thing,
and
that
is
a
specific
compass
direction
and
absolute
heading
a
45
degrees
because
there
are
not
geographical
directions
included
in
the
call
such
as
the
northeastwardly
along
the
coast.
it
doesn't
say
along
the
coast,
it
says
thence
northeastwardly
to
a
point
three
leagues
from
the
coast.
the
only
way
that
you
can
go
northeastwardly
is
a
point
between
north
and
east.
it's
a
direct
compass
reading
of
45
degrees.
even
the
government's
witness,
dr.
devorcey,
testified
on
cross-examination
that
northeastwardly
means
45
degrees,
a
point
between
north
and
east.
and
even
the
special
master
himself,
judge
maris
in
michigan
versus
ohio
original
30
in
1971
interpreted
northeast
as
north
45
degrees
east.
but
in
this
case
for
some
reason,
he
went
southeast
in
order
to
determine
what
the
historical
boundary
of
the
state
of
florida
is.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
not
when
it
says
to
go
to
a
point
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
excepts
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
cross-examination
for
the
government's
own
witness,
he
testified
that
to
him,
that
would
mean
a
point
between
north
and
east
and
he
said
45-degree
angle.
and
that's
what
we
have
contended
throughout
this
proceedings
that
that
is
the
historical
boundary
call
and
that
the
master
is
arbitrarily
added
a
geographical
call
where
none
previously
existed.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir.
this
is
--
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
a
usual
course
and
there's
testimony
in
the
record
that
shrimpers
who
return
from
the
tortugas
shrimp
grounds,
when
they
wanted
to
get
to
the
mainland,
they
set
a
course
of
45
degrees.
they
started
to
cross
this
expands
the
water
to
the
nearest
point
of
the
mainland
before
turning
north.
and
the
point
that
they
invariably
reach
was
cape
romano.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir,
it
would.
it
would
bring
you
right
to
cape
romano.
shrimpers,
we
contend,
have
been
doing
so
for
hundreds
of
years
and
if
the
master's
version
is
accepted,
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
is
ignored.
what's
more,
he
reads
into
the
call,
a
meaning
contrary
to
the
clear
import
of
the
words
because
he
draws
the
boundary
not
northeastwardly
at
all,
but
in
a
direction
southeastwardly
from
the
tortugas.
further,
the
call
concludes
that
it
goes
to
a
specific
point,
that
point
line,
three
marine
leagues
off
the
mainland.
clearly,
it
requires
a
straight
line,
45
degrees
to
cape
romano
and
northeastwardly
standing
alone
without
further
references
to
geographical
locations
either
as
commencing
midpoint
or
terminal
monuments
must
mean
northeast
or
north
45
degree
east
to
constitute
a
definite
boundary.
it's
a
contention
of
florida
that
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
1868,
congress
expressly
or
impliedly
convey
or
granted
to
the
state
the
rights
and
interest
in
the
title
possessed
by
the
united
states
and
the
area
encompassed
by
the
boundary
described
in
the
florida
constitution
in
1868
when
florida
was
readmitted
to
the
union,
which
rights
include
ownership
of
the
submerged
lands
and
resources
of
the
sea.
furthermore,
the
historical
boundary
in
1868
defines
the
outer
perimeter
of
an
area
historically
known
as
florida
bay
which
is
a
historic
bay
or
historic
waters
and
thus,
internal
or
inland
waters
or
the
state
of
florida.
the
contested
area
of
florida
bay
amounts
in
about
8,000
square
miles,
and
this
boundary
as
i
pointed
out
is
not
only
as
florida's
historic
boundary
but
it's
our
only
lawful
boundary.
now,
let
me
address
if
i
may
for
a
few
moments
the
issue
of
florida
bay.
we
claim
the
florida
bay
is
a
historic
bay
and
thus
inland
waters
of
the
state
of
florida.
and
we
construe
it
to
be
all
of
the
waters
bounded
on
the
south
by
the
florida
keys
to
and
including
the
dry
tortugas,
and
on
the
northeast
by
the
florida
peninsula
and
on
the
northwest
by
the
tortugas
with
a
line
running
45
degrees
from
the
tortugas
to
cape
romano.
in
determining
whether
the
state
has
properly
acquired
historic
title
to
a
maritime
area,
this
court
has
said
that
there
are
three
factors;
the
exercise
of
authority
or
sovereignty
by
either
the
state
or
the
federal
government,
the
continuity
for
a
long
period
of
time
of
that
exercise,
and
the
attitude
of
foreign
states,
in
other
words,
acquiescence
by
foreign
states.
in
addition,
it
has
been
held
that
a
coastal
state
may
strengthen
its
claim
by
showing
that
its
vital
interest
are
involved
as
we
did
in
this
case.
we
contend
that
we
proved
our
case
in
all
three
respects.
our
claim
of
historic
title
is
based
upon
the
occupation
of
florida
bay.
the
master
in
concluding
that
we
fail
to
prove
our
claim
ignored
we
contend
compelling
evidence
to
the
contrary,
and
we
also
contend
that
he
held
us
to
the
wrong
burden
of
proof.
he
said
we
have
to
prove
it
clear
beyond
doubt.
to
apply
that
burden
rather
than
a
preponderance
burden
was
error
and
the
matter
should
be
at
the
very
least
to
return
to
the
master
for
additional
testimony
and
hearings
and
the
application
of
the
correct
standard
of
proof.
the
clear
beyond
doubt
test
in
california
too
can
only
be
apply
to
a
state
in
proving
its
historical
claim
where
there
federal
government
by
its
actions
has
made
an
effective
disclaimer
of
sovereign
jurisdiction
in
the
area.
here,
the
federal
government
tried
to
disclaim
and
they
introduce
several
self-serving
declarations
all
made
during
or
within
the
proximity
of
the
commencement
of
this
litigation
and
the
documents
and
evidence
carry
no
specific
disclaimer
that
florida
bay
is
a
historic
bay.
this
purported
disclaimer
should
not
impose
such
an
owner's
burden
on
the
state
of
clear
beyond
doubt.
also
i
would
point
out
that
the
danger
zones
that
had
been
established
by
the
federal
government
in
this
area
right
here,
these
danger
zones
which
only
allow
people
to
enter
that
area
with
permission
by
the
united
states
navy
certainly
represents
an
act
of
dominion
over
florida
bay
by
the
federal
government
which
cannot
be
ignored.
when
the
authority
is
asserted
pursuant
to
a
statute
permitting
such
exercise
of
power
only
in
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states,
they
established
those
danger
zones
based
upon
the
congressional
act
that
allows
them
to
do
so
only
in
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states.
so,
they
obviously
recognized
that
area
as
territorial
waters
not
the
high
seas,
and
it's
hard
to
see
how
the
united
states
has
disclaimed
dominion
over
the
area
when
they
have
danger
zones
that
only
allow
people
to
come
in
on
permission
for
the
united
states
navy
of
approximately
1,900
square
miles.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
yes
sir.
they
bring
us
the
same
place.
we
contend
that
we
have
a
historic
boundary
that
goes
there.
you
could
in
the
alternative
find
that
we
have
a
historic
bay
without
agreeing
that
our
boundaries
where
we
contended
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
that's
right.
also
with
regard
to
the
failure,
the
federal
government
to
disclaim
any
interest
in
the
area,
we
rely
upon
a
treaty
of
the
united
states
with
cuba
in
1957
when
cuba
agreed
to
keep
its
nationals
out
of
the
tortugas
shrimp
beds,
and
we
think
this
represents
active
dominion
of
the
united
states
to
the
historic
florida
bay
area.
further,
we
contend
that
we
have
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
we
contend
we
have
established
even
by
clear
beyond
doubt
test
that
florida
bay
is
a
historical
bay
and
that
is
it
thus
the
inland
waters
of
the
state.
we
contend
that
it's
a
historic
bay
because
we
believe
that
they
dry
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
think
that
if
we're
correct
on
that
argument
and
you
don't
agree
with
us
on
the
establishment
of
the
boundary
that
we
could,
but
we
have
considered.
we
considered
that
question
and
we
felt
that
since
that
is
that
boundary
line
and
the
coastline
that
we
could
not
go
beyond
that
another
three
leagues.
and
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
that
would
be
our
coastline
if
it
is
a
historic
bay.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
perhaps.
we
had
not
thought
that
we
could
get
an
additional
three
leagues
on
top
of
that.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
think
it
gives
us
either
to
the
boundary
or
the
three
leagues
which
ever
is
greater.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
and
in
this
case,
we
get
to
the
boundary
which
would
be
our
coastline
and
that's
the
reason
that
i
think
we
concluded
that
we
couldn't
get
an
additional
three-league.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
alright.
the
historic
bay,
the
dry
tortugas,
we
contend
can
be
considered
as
islands
forming
a
multiple
mouth
bay
and
the
archipelago
known
as
the
florida
keys
certainly
can
from
one
side
of
that
bay
and
it
is
lawfully
conceptual.
florida
bay
is
historically
a
part
of
florida.
ancient
maps
and
charts
that
we
introduced
in
evidence
demonstrate
a
remarkable
continuity
of
florida
bay
but
whatever
name
as
a
distinctive
area
with
roughly
the
same
boundaries
through
the
spanish
experience,
the
british
experience
and
the
american
experience.
and
these
date
back
to
the
jeffers
map
of
1763
and
it
shown
richman
bay
and
chatham
bay
as
a
designation
of
the
area
that
is
now
called
florida
bay.
in
the
early
maps
as
i
pointed
out,
the
keys
area
where
solid
land
mass
and
it
showed
mudflats
from
the
mainland
to
the
tortugas.
also,
the
united
states
acquired
title
to
florida
from
spain
by
virtue
of
the
treaty
of
amity,
settlement,
and
limits.
article
ii
of
that
treaty
provided
for
that
king
of
spain
to
cede
to
the
united
states,
and
i
hope
you'll
pay
close
attention
to
this
language.
“in
full
property
and
sovereignty,
all
of
the
territories
which
belong
to
him
situated
on
the
eastward
of
the
mississippi
known
by
the
name
of
east
and
west
florida,
the
adjacent
islands
dependent
on
said
provinces
which
relate
directly
to
the
property
and
sovereignty
of
said
provinces.”
it
is
clear
to
us
from
this
language
that
the
treaty
would
include
the
dry
tortugas
and
the
water
area
between
the
islands
and
the
mainland
know
as
florida
bay.
what
is
the
utilization
of
florida
bay,
so
as
to
establish
a
historic
bay?
to
begin
with,
when
the
territory
belonged
to
them,
the
spanish
and
british
fished
in
the
area
in
the
period
of
the
late
1700
and
early
1800.
all
of
this
is
in
the
record
and
i
won't
mention
transcript
pages,
but
i
will
relate
specifics
in
the
record.
the
sponge
industry
began
in
1849.
it
extended
from
the
very
shallow
waters
sponging
to
hot
channel
between
the
keys
and
the
reefs.
one
of
our
witnesses,
senator
hodges
who
is
a
director
of
the
department
of
natural
resources
said
“in
my
mind,
i
would
considered
once
again
the
45-degree
angle
from
the
tortugas
north
to
cape
romano
as
an
area
that
was
utilized
for
fisheries
and
for
sponging
and
for
all
other
economic
activities.”
and
about
1870,
sponging
expanded
to
the
areas
up
to
50-foot
in
depth
by
the
use
of
the
glass
bottom
bucket.
kirk
monroe
published
an
article
sponge
and
sponges
in
the
florida
reefs
in
scribner's
magazine
in
1892,
and
he
noted
that
the
“key
west
sponger
has
a
choice
of
two
distinct
fishing
grounds;
they
bay
and
the
reef.
this
former,
the
bay,
includes
all
of
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
washing
the
western
coast
of
florida.”
in
1935,
a
map
of
sponge
fishing
area
for
the
united
states
tariff
commission
notes
a
diving
area
from
cape
romano
north
and
the
hooking
areas
in
the
shallow
waters
of
the
keys
in
florida
bay.
wrecking
was
a
lucrative
and
growing
industry
in
the
florida
straits
in
1850
but
it
gone
on
since
the
early
1700.
what
are
the
expressions
of
sovereign
authority
in
florida
bay?
in
1822,
florida
complained
to
the
federal
government
about
british
inner
loppers
in
the
area
from
cape
florida
to
the
dry
tortugas
fishing
and
turtling.
by
1825,
federal
revenue
cutters
were
patrolling
the
southwest
coast
of
florida.
in
1826,
the
united
states
ordered
all
foreign
fishermen
from
south
florida
waters.
in
1832,
governor
duvall
indicated
that
florida
fishing
and
turtling
were
exclusively
and
solely
for
the
local
jurisdiction
and
for
part
of
citizens
and
he
oppose
giving
british
fishermen
the
right
to
use
florida
waters
or
florida
bay.
and
by
the
way,
these
ships
that
were
in
contention
work
from
20
to
50-ton
ships,
and
would
have
to
employ
in
the
deep
water
of
florida
bay,
it
would
be
at
the
outer
perimeter.
and
this
request
by
great
britain
was
not
granted.
the
florida
legislature
in
1832
enacted
a
law
for
protection
of
the
fisheries
of
the
coast
of
florida
which
included
all
of
the
seas,
bays,
creeks,
and
harbors
adjacent
to
of
the
islands
or
keys
of
the
territory.
and
the
testimony
is
that
it
obviously
included
florida
bay.
in
the
early
1860's,
florida
seas,
connecticut
ships
fishing
off
the
keys.
historically,
florida
bay
was
considered
and
this
was
before
the
florida's
readmission
to
the
union.
historically,
florida
bay
was
considered
as
strategic
military
area.
key
west
was
a
united
states
military
post
in
the
1820's.
in
1822,
deep
draft
vessels
were
used
by
the
united
states
to
combat
pirates
in
orders
north
and
south
of
the
florida
keys
and
the
army
set
up
a
post
in
the
keys
in
1831.
in
1850,
general
harney
had
patrols
from
fort
myers
across
the
waters
of
florida
bay
and
barren
sounds
to
the
florida
keys.
federal
ships
in
early
1860
continuously
patrol
the
waters
along
the
florida
keys
and
the
gulf
coast
during
the
civil
war
to
stop
blockade
runners.
and
we
can
go
on
and
of
course,
i
mentioned
to
you
that
the
florida
lease
lands
for
oil
drilling
in
florida
bay
beginning
in
1941
and
this
included
all
of
florida
bay
up
to
the
45-degree
line
from
the
tortugas
to
cape
romano.
the
territorial
water
acts
of
the
state
in
1963
require
aliens
or
foreign
nationals
to
have
a
license
to
fish
in
florida
waters.
what
are
the
indications
of
foreign
acquiescence
which
is
the
third
criteria
of
florida
bay
area?
in
1831,
the
british
request
to
fish
in
south
florida
waters.
certainly,
indicates
acquiescence
in
control
by
the
state
or
the
federal
government.
in
1845,
great
britain
again
asked
for
permission
to
fish
in
florida
waters
and
enact
of
the
legislature
to
protect
the
fisheries
of
the
coast
of
florida
was
pass.
foreign
nationals
have
never
challenge
marine
patrol
enforcement.
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
testimony
that
lack
of
state
enforcement
over
the
tortugas
shrimp
beds
would
just
about
wipeout
a
$16
million
a
year
industry
and
the
government
of
cuba
has
pointed
out
by
senator
fulbright
during
the
negotiation
between
cuba
and
the
united
states
for
the
treaty
in
1957
to
keep
cuban
nationals
from
fishing
in
the
shrimp
beds
of
the
dry
tortugas.
senator
fulbright
said
that
the
cuban
government
was
honoring
the
request
of
florida.
they
had
a
gentlemen's
agreement
which
certainly
indicates
acquiescence
in
the
authority
of
the
state
of
florida.
professor
tebo,
who
is
a
professor
of
emeritus
of
history
at
the
university
of
miami,
testified
that
northward
from
key
west
on
the
gulf
side,
the
mainland
of
sea
traffic
lay
west
of
cape
romano.
this
was
a
passage
inside
the
cape,
but
its
usage
was
limited
to
small
boats
with
skilled
navigators.
they
knew
that
tortugas
channels
through
the
shallow
waters.
between
these
limits,
lay
the
distinctive
area
and
now
designated
florida
bay,
set
aside
by
geography
and
history
as
part
of
florida.
and
dr.
samuel
proctor,

said
that
floridians
and
other
informed
persons
at
the
time
knew
the
importance
of
the
resources
adjacent
to
the
florida
coast.
they
were
aware
of
the
importance
of
these
waters.
consequently,
these
men
writing
florida's
constitution
and
operating
in
the
best
interest
of
the
state
would
have
wanted
to
enclose
as
much
of
the
areas
possible
within
their
state
boundaries.
this,
they
sought
to
do
in
writing
the
boundary
article
in
the
1868
constitution.
we
have
historically
exercise
police
power
over
the
statute.
the
1893
statute
prohibiting
foreign
fishing
in
florida
waters
without
a
license,
the
1915
state
laws
making
all
fishing
in
florida
waters
including
the
bays
to
be
florida
property
and
the
regulation
of
shrimping
in
the
tortugas
since
1957.
no
one
has
challenge
florida's
exercise
of
its
marine
conservation
laws
except
two
cuban
vessels
which
were
arrested
within
three
leagues
of
land.
in
addition
to
which,
the
federal
government
in
appending
case
in
the
united
states
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
florida,
has
sought
in
an
injunction
against
the
state
and
has
asserted
that
florida
attempts
to
regulate
or
prohibit
foreign
fishing
boats
more
than
12
geographic
miles
from
any
part
of
the
coastline
of
the
state
between
cape
romano
and
the
dry
tortugas.
so,
even
the
federal
government
recognized
that
we
do
attempt
to
exercise
police
power
all
the
way
out
to
the
45-degree
angle
between
the
tortugas
and
cape
romano.
perhaps
the
most
significant
aspect
of
this
case
in
determining
the
attitude
of
foreign
governments
to
florida's
claim
of
historic
title
to
florida
bay
is
the
absolute
absence
of
any
evidence
or
hint
of
evidence
from
the
federal
government
that
any
country
has
in
the
past
150
years,
protested
or
objected
to
florida's
overt
pack
or
assertion
of
sovereign
claim
to
florida
bay.
and
highly
significant
in
regard
to
assertion
of
sovereignty
is
the
act
of
the
united
states
congress
in
affirming
to
the
world
in
1868
that
one
of
the
states
in
the
union,
florida
had
a
marine
boundary
from
the
dry
tortugas
islands
to
the
mainland
which
formed
the
northwest
perimeter
of
the
bay.
throughout
these
proceedings,
the
united
states
concern
for
its
position
with
regard
to
foreign
affairs
has
been
paramount.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
government,
foreign
affairs
is
not
a
material
issue,
whether
work
powers,
authority
over
interstate
of
foreign
commerce
or
authority
over
international
relations
maybe
exercise
within
florida's
boundaries,
whether
marine
land
or
dry
land
has
never
been
at
issue.
these
paramount
powers
we
concede
may
be
exercise
if
appropriate
by
the
federal
government
in
any
part
of
any
state
at
any
time.
but
just
because
they
may
be
paramount
in
lake
okeechobee
which
happens
to
be
an
inland
lake
in
the
state
of
florida
does
not
mean
that
florida
cannot
regulate
fishing
therein
or
the
taking
of
the
minerals
from
the
bottom,
from
the
seabed.
also,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
innocent
passage
of
foreign
shipping
is
in
fact
frustrated
by
florida's
claim
that
the
keys
out
to
and
including
the
tortugas
constitute
in
integral
part
of
the
state,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
innocent
passage
in
the
area
between
the
keys
in
the
mainland.
the
nominated
florida
bay
has
or
will
in
any
way
be
denied,
should
this
court
find
that
it
is
a
historic
bay
constituting
the
inland
waters
of
the
state
of
florida.
there
will
be
no
interruption
to
the
right
of
innocent
passage
and
this
case
was
not
brought
in
the
face
of
any
international
dispute
involving
florida.
our
last
major
point
and
i
think
i
had
just
a
few
--
about
six,
seven
minutes
left,
five
minutes
left.
my
last
major
point
and
we
preserve
all
our
other
arguments
in
the
brief
not
argued,
is
that
it
--
that
this
case
as
it
relates
to
florida
does
required
determination
of
the
rights
under
the
submerged
lands
act
and
united
states
versus
florida
that
it
mandates
a
determination
of
the
demarcation
between
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
atlantic
ocean
because
if
the
federal
government
assuming
arguendo
is
correct,
and
we
are
limited
to
three
marine
miles
in
the
atlantic
and
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
and
not
any
further,
then
it's
imperative
that
we
determine
where
is
the
gulf
and
where
is
the
atlantic.
we
contend
that
the
boundary
between
these
two
bodies
is
at
latitude
25
degrees,
40
minutes
north
the
position
of
cape
florida
which
means
that
the
florida
keys
and
the
straits
of
florida
southwestwardly
of
such
latitude
are
located
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
not
in
the
atlantic
ocean.
the
master
says
everything
north
of
the
tortugas
is
gulf
and
everything
south
is
in
the
atlantic,
and
that
dispute
here
is
about
a
1,000
square
miles,
the
difference
between
three
leagues
and
three
miles.
the
federal
government
takes
its
description,
and
by
the
way,
this
is
their
major
piece
of
evidence.
i
think
they
are
sole
piece
of
evidence
on
this
point.
they
take
a
description
from
the
gulf
which
the
master
adopts
from
the
international
hydrographic
bureau
special
publication.
they
say
this
proves
up
their
case.
and
in
the
description
itself
on
the
face
of
the
map,
it
says
“these
limits
have
no
political
significance
whatsoever”,
and
then
the
authors
go
on
to
say
that
it's
not
to
be
regarded
as
representing
the
results
of
a
full
geographic
study.
they
point
out
it's
primarily
for
uniformity.
we
presented
the
testimony
of
a
renowned
expert
in
marine
geology
and
sedimentology.
he
testified
unequivocally
that
the
international
hydrographic
bureau
boundaries
between
the
gulf
and
the
atlantic
have
no
scientific
basis
whatsoever
in
terms
of
these
parameters
that
form
the
basis
for
the
geological
and
geometric
boundaries.
florida
contends
that
the
finding
of
the
master
is
incorrect,
contrary
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
as
to
where
the
gulf
meets
the
atlantic.
we
contend
that
it
should
be
decided
on
marine
geology
and
sedimentology
and
it
is
best
visualized
by
the
fact
that
if
the
area
were
to
be
viewed,
if
all
the
water
were
removed,
a
natural
drainage
basis
would
appear
separating
the
gulf
and
the
atlantic
at
that
point.
historic
evidence,
mariner's
evidence,
geological
evidence
defining
the
straits
of
florida
and
the
florida
keys
as
being
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
was
totally
ignored
by
the
master.
all
of
these
was
subordinate
to
one
piece
of
evidence,
a
map,
which
is
i
pointed
out
on
its
face
belies
its
persuasive
effect
on
the
very
point
for
which
it
was
used.
the
testimony
of
the
state
is
quite
persuasive.
dr.
ginsburg
testified.
he
referred
to
numerous
texts
beginning
with
the
1957
edition
of
the
encyclopedia
britannica
including
the
71
edition
of
mcgraw-hill
encyclopedia
of
science
and
technology,
the
bulletin
of
geological
society
of
america
1971,
the
1972
edition
of
the
same
bulletin.
he
also
--
in
each
of
these,
it
refers
to
the
florida
shelf
or
the
florida
platform
including
the
keys
and
the
tortugas
entirely
within
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
addition,
he
testified
how
topography
identifies
the
dividing
line.
the
submarine
topography
visualize
as
a
terrestrial
landscape
which
separate
the
gulf
and
the
atlantic
basins.
he
testifies
at
25
degrees,
40
minutes
north
with
the
keys
and
the
tortugas
and
the
florida
shrimps
in
the
gulf.
he
testified
how
sediment
in
the
capes
of
dividing
line.
he
said
there
is
a
relatively
abrupt
change
between
the
coral
reef
limestone,
south
of
soldier
key
to
atlantic
type
sandy
barrier
islands,
north
of
cape
florida,
and
that
that
is
the
major
change
in
the
coastal
morphology.
he
also
testified
as
to
the
organisms
that
indicated
the
dividing
line.
so,
our
position
therefore
is
that
the
configuration
of
the
seafloor
should
control.
the
states
of
florida
are
part
of
the
gulf
since
they
were
drain
into
the
gulf
if
they
were
dry
upland
basis.
the
basis
for
this
position
is
that
submarine
topography
should
follow
the
same
criteria
as
terrestrial
topography.
dry
land
is
considered
to
be
part
of
the
basin
into
which
it
drains.
since
the
straits
of
florida
were
drained
into
the
gulf,
if
on
the
gulf
--
if
on
dry
land,
they
are
part
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
basin.
they
are
not
part
of
the
atlantic
ocean.
so,
the
weight
and
the
quality
of
the
evidence
clearly
indicates
that
florida's
contention
as
to
the
location
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
correct.
thank
you.
