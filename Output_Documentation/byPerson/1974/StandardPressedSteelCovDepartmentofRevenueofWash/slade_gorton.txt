mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
on
the
surface,
at
least,
appears
to
involve
primarily
a
question
as
to
the
required
nexus
or
jurisdictional
threshold
necessary
to
sustain
the
washington
gross
receipts
tax.
but
a
closer
look
shows
that
it
involves
much
more.
the
nexus
or
jurisdictional
threshold
question
cannot
realistically
be
looked
at
in
isolation.
we
must
also
examine
the
assertion
that
the
tax
here
imposed
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
or
exposes
the
taxpayers’
interstate
business
to
multiple
burdens.
i
pose
to
discuss
each
of
these
problems
and
the
relationship
between
them.
putting
it
in
terms
of
your
decision
in
general
motor,
i
intend
to
establish
two
propositions.
first,
that
the
imposition
of
our
gross
receipts
tax
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
the
criteria
established
by
the
majority
in
general
motors.
indeed,
that
it
is
even
more
soundly
based
than
is
the
decision
in
that
case.
second,
i
propose
to
show
that
our
tax
here
is
imposed
in
a
manner
which
will
satisfy
the
basic
concerns
expressed
in
the
two
dissenting
opinions
in
the
general
motors
case
and
that
the
answer
to
those
concerns
is
to
be
found
in
decisions
of
this
court
dating
back
more
than
40
years.
standard
pressed
steel
is
a
manufacturer
and
wholesaler
of
highly
technical
and
specialize
aerospace
fasteners
with
plants
in
pennsylvania
and
california.
one
of
its
major
customers
was
the
boeing
company
in
seattle.
the
state
of
washington
levied
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
standard’s
wholesale
sales
to
boeing
which
standard
here
seeks
to
recover.
during
the
early
part
of
the
period
for
which
the
taxes
were
levied,
standard
had
an
office
in
seattle.
that
office
was
closed
early
in
1966
at
which
time
standard
assigned
one
full-time
employee,
one
martinson
to
its
boeing
account.
martinson
was
a
washington
resident
with
an
office
in
his
home.
standard
denominated
him
as
sales
engineer
and
he
reported
to
the
company’s
sales
manager.
martinson
spent
100%
of
his
time
representing
standard
in
its
relationship
with
boeing.
most
of
his
time,
he
spent
in
qualifying
standard’s
products
for
purchase
by
boeing.
that
qualification
procedure
was
an
absolute
prerequisite
to
boeing’s
purchase
or
use
of
any
of
standard’s
products.
martinson
also
worked
with
boeing’s
engineers
in
solving
problems
arising
out
of
boeing’s
use
of
standards
products
after
they
were
qualified
calling
on
outside
technical
assistants
which
came
into
the
state
when
necessary.
he
kept
standard
informed
as
to
who
is
who
in
boeing’s
constantly
changing
purchasing
hierarchy,
suggested
sales
campaigns,
and
did
some
promotional
hosting.
martinson’s
activities
were
clearly
more
decisive
factors
in
establishing
and
holding
standard’s
market
with
boeing
than
were
those
of
the
washington
employees
of
general
motors
in
holding
its
local
market
considered
in
your
last
case
involving
our
gross
receipts
tax.
general
motors
is
our
largest
national
corporation
selling
perhaps
our
most
widely
advertised
all
national
products.
standard
on
the
other
hand,
sold
specially
products
to
a
single
customer
which
imposed
rigid
standards
on
its
suppliers.
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
overwhelmingly
more
decisive
nature
of
martinson’s
activities
in
establishing
and
maintaining
standard’s
market
in
washington
state
than
was
the
case
with
the
service
of
general
motors’
local
employees
in
your
decision
involving
that
corporation.
mr.
slade
gorton
of
its
total
--
mr.
slade
gorton
gross
income,
no,
the
record
makes
no
such
showing.
it
obviously
--
this
was
obviously
a
relatively
small
portion
of
it.
moreover,
it
can
be
calculated
from
the
records
of
the
two
cases
that
martinson’s
activities
resulted
in
a
greater
dollar
volume
of
sales
in
washington
than
the
volume
at
least
of
the
chevrolet
division
of
general
motors
divided
by
the
number
of
its
employees
in
the
state.
next,
let’s
compare
martinson’s
activities
with
the
facts
in
the
norton
case.
in
norton,
our
gross
receipts
tax
based
on
that
firm’s
sales
volume
in
illinois
was
upheld
to
the
extent
that
it
was
based
on
sales
to
which
norton’s
in-state
office
was
connected
only
by
reason
of
having
taken
orders
for
items
not
in
stock
or
for
special
equipment
or
in
order
to
reduce
freight
charges
by
accumulating
and
reconsigning
shipments
originating
out-of-state.
these
services
were
found
to
be
in
the
court’s
own
word,
helpful
to
norton
in
competing
for
business
in
illinois,
thus
subjecting
those
sales
to
taxation.
only
sales
to
illinois
customers
in
which
norton’s
illinois
office
played
no
part
at
all
except
for
making
available
engineering
and
technical
advice
were
exempt
from
taxation.
martinson’s
role
in
standard’s
sales
to
boeing
was
more
vital
to
those
sales
than
that
of
the
illinois
office
of
the
norton
company
in
its
contested
sales
which
were
held
taxable.
if
the
only
concern
of
the
court
in
this
case
were
the
degree
to
which
martinson’s
activities
were
decisive
factors
in
creating
standard’s
market
with
boeing,
the
answer
is
so
obviously
in
the
affirmative
as
to
render
the
controversy
insufficiently
important
to
have
been
brought
before
this
court
at
all
but
nevertheless,
both
norton
and
general
motors
and
for
that
matter,
the
vast
majority
of
other
significant
cases
involving
state
taxation
of
what
was
asserted
to
be
interstate
commerce
were
decided
by
this
court
by
less
than
unanimous
decisions,
the
expressed
concern
of
the
dissenters
in
general
motors
and
i
suspect
of
members
of
the
majority
as
well
was
the
threat
of
multiple
taxation
or
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
and
the
consequent
advisability
or
necessity
of
apportionment
of
a
gross
receipts
tax.
it
is
perhaps
sufficient
to
respond
that
appellant
has
utterly
failed
to
show
the
existence
of
multiple
taxation
in
fact
in
this
case.
indeed,
it
could
not
do
so.
standard’s
interest
in
this
case
is
not
the
avoidance
of
multiple
taxation
but
the
avoidance
of
all
taxation
on
its
washington
business.
if
pennsylvania
or
california
were
to
attempt
to
levy
a
tax
on
standard’s
sales
transactions
with
boeing
and
washington
state,
standard’s
challenged
to
that
attempt
would
be
completely
successful
under
the
doctrine
of
evco
versus
jones,
gwin,
white
&
prince,
freeman
versus
hewitt
and
adams
manufacturing
versus
storen.
in
fact,
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain,
this
court
has
never
permitted
the
originating
state
to
tax
the
receipts
from
sales
to
customers
beyond
their
borders.
sales
standard
here
seeks
to
avoid
paying
its
own
way,
its
fair
share
of
the
state
tax
burden
by
escaping
taxation
measured
by
the
proceeds
of
those
sales
in
either
the
originating
or
the
destination
state.
it’s
appropriate,
however,
to
go
beyond
the
fact
of
the
absence
of
multiple
tax
burdens
and
to
examine
the
question
of
whether
such
burdens
are
possible
in
theory
given
as
a
result
of
the
pattern
of
washington
gross
receipts
taxation.
they
are
not.
as
i
have
just
pointed
out,
this
court
has
never
permitted
the
state
of
origin
to
impose
either
a
gross
receipts
tax
or
a
sales
tax
on
the
proceeds
of
a
sale
to
a
customer
beyond
its
borders.
thus,
there
is
no
need
for
requiring
apportionment
on
the
part
of
the
destination
state.
you
consistently
have
preferred
the
destination
state
in
your
decisions.
the
concept
of
apportionment
has
never
arisen
in
connection
with
sales
or
use
taxes
for
example.
it
should
not
by
the
same
reason
apply
in
connection
with
gross
receipts
taxes
on
sales
of
tangible,
personal
property.
in
concept,
such
taxes
are
identical
to
sales
taxes.
each
is
measured
by
the
proceeds
from
or
the
price
of
a
transaction
or
transactions.
mr.
slade
gorton
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commerce
clause,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
argument
would
be
just
as
good
from
a
conceptual
point
of
view.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
not
from
a
point
of
view
of
the
history
of
your
decisions
as
they
relate
to
due
process.
we’ve
already
established
the
due
process
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
once
we’ve
established
that,
we’re
saying
that
a
sales
tax
and
a
gross
receipts
tax
is
identical.
we
are
admitting
that
we
must
establish
that
jurisdictional
nexus
to
impose
any
tax
at
all
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
national
bellas
case
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
in
that
case,
there
was
however,
no
real
jurisdiction.
it
was
a
mail
order
catalogue
seller.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
had
no
employee,
it
did
nothing
in
the
state
of
illinois
other
than
to
send
catalogues
into
the
state
and
send
by
common
carrier
its
goods
into
the
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
was
a
--
they
made
a
commerce
claim
in
it.
theoretically
at
least,
the
court
never
needed
to
reach
that
because
illinois
had
no
jurisdiction
to
--
mr.
slade
gorton
and
the
court
said
under
those
circumstances
that
perhaps
apportionment
would
solve
the
problem.
what
i’m
saying,
the
point
i’m
making
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
apportionment
doesn’t
solve
the
problem
of
--
or
apportionment
solves
the
problem
of
multiple
tax
burdens
while
creating
a
greater
problem
of
the
escape
from
any
taxation
at
all
of
much,
of
many
transfer
in
interstate
commerce.
we
believe
that
the
actual
results
of
your
case
are
consistent
with
the
proposition
that
a
preference
for
the
destination
state
which
you
have
invariably
granted
solves
both
problems.
both
the
problem
of
multiple
taxation
and
the
problem
of
the
escape
from
their
fair
share
of
taxes.
mr.
slade
gorton
illinois
was
the
destination
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
at
least
in
part
--
i
think
in
controlling
part
because
there
was
no
presence
whatsoever
of
national
bellas
hess
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
it’s
identical
to
a
use
tax.
it’s
identical
to
a
sales
tax.
mr.
slade
gorton
we’re
not
trying
to
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
though
--
mr.
slade
gorton
though
you
have
gone
a
long
way
in
use
taxes
and
permitting
its
collection
from
the
seller,
if
he
fails
to
make
collection
from
the
buyer
and
to
forward
it
to
the
state.
the
only
difference
between
a
sales
tax
and
a
gross
receipts
tax
really
is
that
the
sales
tax
is
separately
stated.
it’s
really
the
only
economic
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that’s
right
but
both
taxes
go
into
the
cost
of
the
goods
sold.
the
only
difference
is
in
the
sales
tax,
in
the
invoice,
it’s
separately
stated,
in
the
business
and
occupation
tax
and
the
gross
receipts
tax,
it’s
just
simply
included
in
the
price.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
purports
to
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
this
purports
to
be
on
the
privilege
or
act
of
wholesaling
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
incident
in
the
state
of
washington
are
two
in
nature
really
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it’s
measured
by
the
gross
receipts
of
the
transaction
as
exactly
and
precisely
as
the
sales
tax
is.
mr.
slade
gorton
of
course,
they’re
interstate
sales.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
taxes
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
depends
on
your
technical
definition
of
the
incidents.
it
is
a
tax
which
is
going
to
cost
a
dealer
in
interstate
commerce
money.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
it
affects
interstate
commerce.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
will
not
come
up
unless
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
in
international
harvester
versus
department
of
treasury
at
the
322
u.s.
340
some
30
years
ago,
this
court
dealing
with
an
indiana
gross
receipts
tax
conceptually
indistinguishable
from
washington
tax
involved
here
said
and
i
am
quoting
now,
“in
this
case,
as
in
sales
tax
cases,
the
taxable
transaction
is
at
the
final
stage
of
an
interstate
movement”
which
i
think
answers
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart
“and
the
taxes
on
the
gross
receipts
from
an
interstate
transaction
in
form,
the
use
tax
is
different
but
we
recognize
that
the
sales
tax
and
the
use
tax
had
no
different
effect
upon
interstate
commerce.”
there
is
the
same
practical
equivalence
whether
the
tax
is
on
the
selling
or
the
buying
phase
of
the
transaction.
each
in
substance
is
an
imposition
of
a
tax
on
the
transfer
of
property.
in
light
of
our
recent
decisions,
it
could
hardly
be
held
that
indiana
lacked
constitutional
authority
to
impose
a
sales
tax
or
a
use
tax
on
these
transactions
but
if
that
is
true,
a
constitutional
difference
is
not
apparent
when
a
gross
receipts
tax
is
utilized
instead.
in
every
case
in
this
court
involving
a
gross
receipts
tax
based
on
sales
transactions
for
more
than
40
years,
the
result
has
been
totally
consistent
with
your
contemporary
sales
tax
decisions.
both,
when
the
gross
receipts
tax
was
upheld
and
when
it
was
struck
down.
perhaps
it
is
time
to
recognize
that
the
concepts
behind
the
two
taxes
are
identical
and
that
for
the
ease
of
both
judicial
and
tax
administration,
it
is
appropriate
to
treat
them
identically
reaffirming
international
harvester.
once
the
destination
state
has
demonstrated
a
sufficient
presence
of
the
seller
within
its
borders
and
a
sufficient
connection
between
that
presence
and
the
transaction
it
seeks
to
tax
to
meet
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
due
process,
it
is
as
fair
to
permit
it
to
base
its
tax
on
the
entire
gross
receipts
of
the
sale
as
it
is
to
levy
--
to
permit
it
to
levy
a
sales
or
use
tax
on
that
same
measure
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
sale.
it
is
as
completely
free
from
the
possibility
of
multiple
taxation
by
reason
of
your
consistent
prohibition
of
a
similar
tax
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
origin.
a
sales
transaction,
after
all
can
only
be
consummated
by
delivery
to
the
buyer
and
that
can
occur
in
only
one
state,
the
destination
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
don’t
think
i’m
making
a
new
proposal.
it’s
totally
consistent
with
what
this
court
has
always
held
in
fact
whatever
its
theoretical
discussions
of
apportionment.
the
problem
of
multiple
taxation
which
leads
to
the
consideration
of
apportionment
is
not
solved
by
a
higher
jurisdictional
threshold.
no
matter
how
high
you
set
that
threshold,
some
of
the
activities
causing
consideration
of
apportionment
will
have
taken
place
in
the
state
of
origin.
the
solution
is
not
apportionment
nor
a
high
jurisdictional
threshold
but
a
preference
in
all
cases
for
the
destination
state.
one
final
point
on
the
subject
of
multiple
taxation.
in
his
dissent
in
general
motors,
mr.
justice
goldberg
expressed
concern
that
at
the
state
of
origin,
had
a
tax
pattern
like
that
or
identical
to
that
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
state
of
origin
would
levy
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
manufacturing
process
while
washington
would
levy
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
wholesaling
function
both
taxes
measured
by
the
sales
price.
in
contrast
where
both
of
the
functions
confined
to
washington
state,
only
one
of
the
two
taxes
would
be
imposed
because
washington
exempts
from
the
manufacturing
tax
those
goods
which
are
subject
to
the
wholesaling
tax.
the
vice
of
the
system
described
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
best
understood
in
terms
of
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
rather
than
multiple
taxation.
the
system
treats
the
manufacturing
and
wholesaling
processes
as
a
single
activity
with
the
imposition
of
a
single
tax
if
both
processes
are
confined
to
one
state.
but
the
system
does
not
treat
both
processes
as
a
single
taxable
activity
if
they
are
split
between
two
states.
the
state
statutory
policy
of
otherwise,
permissible
pyramiding
of
the
tax
is
not
extended
evenhandedly
to
both
local
and
interstate
business.
but
this
system

statute

the
taxation
of

would
violate
constitutional
standards.
it
is
the
position
of
my
office
to
which
the
department

revenue
exceeds

the
system
described
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
would

unconstitutional

our
statute

thus
eliminate
from

if
the
seller’s
manufacturing
process
had
been
subjected
to
a
valid
gross

tax
in
another
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
do
not
have
a
net
income
tax.
but
standard
here
has
not
established
either
the
risk
or
actuality
of
multiple
taxation.
not
because
of
the
negligence
of
its
officers
or
attorneys
but
because
there
was
no
such
risk
or
actuality.
under
your
decisions,
neither
pennsylvania
nor
california
could
have
levied
a
tax
on
the
wholesaling
transactions.
neither
of
the
states
has
attempted
to
do
so
on
the
manufacturing
process.
standard
seeks
here
purely
and
simply
and
exemption
from
all
taxation
on
its
washington
business
transactions.
such
an
exemption
would
be
unsound
in
policy
as
it
would
grant
standard’s
commerce
a
free
ride,
freedom
from
its
fair
share
of
the
burden
of
government;
thus,
either
limiting
the
ability
of
the
government

the
state
of
washington
to
provide
the
blessings
of
civilized
government
to
everyone
utilizing
the
facilities
of
the
state
including
standard
and

its
resident

engineer
or
casting
an
undue
burden
on
other
taxpayers.
mr.
slade
gorton
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
return
very
briefly
to
one
of
the
two
principle
questions
involved
in
this
case,
that
of
the
necessary
threshold
or
amount
of
activities
within
the
state
to
justify
any
form
of
taxation
whatsoever,
i
discussed
this
morning
the
proposition
that
the
actual
activities
of
standard
within
the
state
of
washington
exceeded
in
their
relationships
to
its
business
in
the
state,
those
of
either
general
motors
or
norton.
i
also
pointed
out
the
very
close
parallel
in
your
previous
decisions
between
cases
dealing
with
sales
taxes
and
those
dealing
with
gross
receipts
taxes.
in
that
respect,
the
most
significant
case
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
regrettably
is
mcgoldrick
v.
dugrenier
at
309
u.s.
70
in
1940
in
which
a
sales
tax
was
allowed
to
be
imposed
on
an
out-of-state
company
which
did
an
exclusively
interstate
business
in
new
york
city
through
not
a
resident
but
a
general
agent
shipping
all
of
its
goods
on
which
the
taxes
were
levied
in
interstate
commerce
directly
to
purchaser
without
the
general
agents
having
had
anything
to
do
with
them.
secondly,
in
connection
with
this
threshold
matter
was
the
question
asked
of
my
brother
about
the
applicability
or
relativity
of
the
drummer
cases
such
as
nippert
versus
richmond
and
memphis
steam
laundry.
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
in
the
19th
century
and
the
early
20th
century,
those
two
cases,
the
only
recent
cases
on
drummers
deal
in
one
case
with
an
out-of-state
laundry
which
was
subjected
in
terms
to
a
far
greater
tax
burden,
quite
specifically
simply
because
it
was
from
out-of-state
than
was
its
in-state
competition.
in
nippert,
the
tax
was
a
flat
license
fee
in
large
part
with
no
relation
to
the
amount
of
business
done
which
the
court
determined
would
certainly
hit
sporadic
solicitation
harder
than
full-time
resident
solicitation
and
in
addition
was
subject
to
repetition
in
every
community
in
the
state.
also
of
course,
all
of
the
solicitors
in
both
of
those
cases
were
itinerant.
each
of
which
identifies
it
from
the
case
we
have
here.
finally,
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
my
brother
whether
there
was
an
acceptable
method
of
apportionment
in
this
case
and
i
believe
the
answer
was
none
of
which
he
knew.
i
don’t
believe
that
he
was
giving
away
anything
in
connection
with
that
acknowledgement
as
that
was
one
of
the
questions
which
very
seriously
troubled
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
his
dissent
from
general
motors
where
he
said
that
the
attempt
to
determine
the
fairness
of
an
interstate
sales
tax
of
a
given
percentage
imposed
on
given
activities
in
one
state
would
be
almost
as
unseemly
as
an
attempt
to
determine
whether
that
same
tax
was
fairly
apportioned
in
light
of
taxes
levied
on
the
same
transactions
by
other
states.
the
infinite
variety
of
factual
configurations
would
readily
frustrate
the
usual
process
of
clarification
through
judicial
exclusion
and
inclusion.
mr.
slade
gorton
mcgoldrick
is
of
help
to
us,
the
particular
mcgoldrick
case,
there
were
more
than
one.
there
were
three
cases
in
which
the
mcgoldrick
name
appears.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
there
are
two
there
in
that
report.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
the
norton
--
the
cite
in
norton
is
mcgoldrick
versus
berwind-white
coal
company
which
also
involved
a
sales
tax
in
which
the
presence
in
the
state
consisted
of
a
in-state
office,
delivery
in-state
actually
by
a
carrier
which
was
owned
by
the
out-of-state
seller.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
did
distinguish
the
sales
tax
situation.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
did
distinguish
it
on
the
ground
that
the
sales
tax
is
collected
--
excuse
me,
that
the
sales
tax
has
collected
from
the
seller.
gross
receipt
tax
at
least
in
theory
is
collected
from
the
--
excuse
me,
a
gross
receipts
tax
is
collected
from
the
seller,
a
sales
tax
is
collected
from
the
purchaser
but
that
is
a
theoretical
and
technical
difference
which
has
nothing
to
do.
mr.
slade
gorton
oh,
no.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
fall
directly
within
norton.
you
need
not
disavow
norton
whatsoever.
our
jurisdictional
threshold
is
far
greater
than
norton.
norton
involved
a
gross
receipts
tax.
the
gross
receipts
tax
was
permitted
in
norton
on
transactions
with
which
the
in-state
office
of
norton
had
far
less
connection
than
the
in-state
sales
of
standard
had
with
its
office
through
martinson.
the
material
to
which
you
refer,
mr.
justice
white
in
norton
is
dictum
--
it
was
not
necessary
to
the
conclusion
of
that
case.
in
norton,
there
were
certain
sales
which
were
found
not
to
be
taxable.
those
sales
in
which
the
in-state
office
played
no
role
whatsoever
except
theoretically
having
available
certain
engineering
advice.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
any
event,
our
case
can
be
solidly
based
on
either
mcgoldrick
or
on
the
actual
findings
in
norton.
it
doesn’t
matter
which
or
whether
or
not
they
are
distinguishable
because
both
of
them
are
consistent
with
taxability
in
the
case
which
we
have
here
before
you.
the
problem
that
seems
to
me
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
brought
up
in
the
general
motors
case
is
that
this
court
finds
it
very
difficult
to
state
if
not
impossible
in
connection
with
individual
controversies
to
state
a
rule
dealing
with
apportionment
that’s
all
inclusive,
unlike
the
congress
which
perhaps
could
operate
in
this
area
had
it
chosen
to
do
so.
the
solution
to
mr.
justice
goldberg’s
dilemma
is
not
infinitely
to
increase
the
jurisdictional
threshold,
not
to
require
an
apportionment
which
never
seems
to
meet
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
case
but
simply
to
follow
the
conclusions
to
which
you
have
previously
come
that
the
destination
state
will
be
preferred.
that
prevents
multiple
taxation
as
well
as
apportionment
does
but
it
serves
another
goal.
apportionment
tends
to
increase
the
area
which
will
evade
taxation
entirely.
a
preference
for
the
destination
state
however
wish
--
however
far
you
wish
to
carry
it,
tends
to
narrow
that
and
to
follow
your
oft
expressed
doctrine
that
interstate
commerce
should
carry
its
fair
share
of
the
load.
one
other
point
which
was
brought
up
earlier
today
only
by
inference
is
the
proposition
that
one
of
these
other
states
might
in
theory
at
least
have
an
income
tax
and
whether
or
not
we
should
not
be
required
to
apportion
our
gross
receipts
tax
by
reason
of
that
income
tax.
now,
that
should
be
required
only
to
the
extent
that
every
sales
and
gross
receipts
tax
case
which
you
have
sustained
since
berwind-white,
in
the
mcgoldrick
versus
berwind-white
should
require
similar
apportionment.
the
gross
receipts
tax
on
retail
sales
from
the
local
store
in
norton
for
example
which
everyone
including
the
taxpayer
assumed
was
valid
included
in
its
measure
incidence
of
value
attributable
to
activities
in
the
state
of
origin.
the
sears,
roebuck
store
in
seattle,
washington
collects
a
sales
tax
on
every
retail
sale
based
on
its
entire
sales
price
even
though
much
of
that
price
was
created
by
a
manufacturing
process
in
another
state
which
subjects
sears
to
a
net
income
tax
in
that
state.
you
have
never
purported
to
require
apportionment
of
a
sales
tax
since
these
taxes
under
internal
harvester
are
conceptually
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
factually
the
same.
there
should
be
no
requirement
here
when
the
problem
can
so
easily
be
solved
by
simply
following
your
prior
decisions
preferring
the
destination
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
here
in
your
index.
mr.
slade
gorton
i’m
informed
that
there
is.
mr.
slade
gorton
our
state
printer
has
many
gremlins
in
his
office
evidently
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
can.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
will
do
so.
