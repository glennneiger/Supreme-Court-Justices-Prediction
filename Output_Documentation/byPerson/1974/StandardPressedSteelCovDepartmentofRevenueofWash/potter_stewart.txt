mr.
cornell,
incidentally,
did
either
california
or
pennsylvania
tax
these
gross
receipts?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
of
any
fair
way
to
apportion
here
if
we
get
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
this
employee
worked
out
of
his
own
home,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
was
he
full
time?
justice
potter
stewart
he
just
used
a
portion
of
one
room
in
his
house
to
perform
this
full-time
work
for
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
which
you
say
was
engineering
work
although
the
fact
is
his
degree
was
in
animal
husbandry.
and
it
was
the
--
how
about
the
telephone
book
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
--
what
number
was
that,
was
it
this
man’s
home?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
have
any
secretarial
help
or
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
he
do
when
he
wanted
to
communicate
with?
justice
potter
stewart
where
i
wrote
opinion
and
i
can’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
about
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cornell,
i
suppose
it’s
of
no
consequence,
are
we
talking
about
much
money
here?
justice
potter
stewart
over
how
long
a
period?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it’s
of
great
consequence
to
the
state
of
course
because
there
must
be
other
taxpayers
in
similar
positions?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
national
bellas
hess
case,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
didn’t
that
involve
both
the
commerce
claim
and
the
due
process
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
didn’t
it
--
that
was
the
due
process
claim?
and
then
what
about
the
--
it
also
involved
the
commerce
claim,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
did
it
reach
it,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
national
bellas
hess,
illinois
was
the
destination
state?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
held
that
illinois
did
not
have
power
to
impose
that
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
the
due
process
part?
justice
potter
stewart
the
economic
effect
of
this
tax
is
the
same
as
a
use
tax,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
my
brother
white
was
quite
correct
isn’t
he
in
saying
that
the
tax
is
imposed
directly
upon
interstate
activity?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
want
you
to
lose
your
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
tax
on
his
sales
in
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
surely,
neither
pennsylvania
nor
california
could
tax
as
such
the
gross
receipts
on
wholesale
sales
made
by
your
client
in
the
state
of
washington.
they
might
be
able
to
impose
general
income
taxes
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
excise
taxes
or
other
taxes
but
they
couldn’t
tax
as
such
and
exclusively
could
they
the
gross
receipts
of
wholesale
sales
made
by
standard
process
steel
company
in
the
state
of
washington?
