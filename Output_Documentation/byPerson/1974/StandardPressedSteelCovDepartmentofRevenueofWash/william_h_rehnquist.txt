william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn’t
that
when
you’re
talking
about
you’re
starting
to
tax
the
gross
income
and
then
you
have
to
divide
it
up
by
these
percentages
rather
than
just
the
gross
receipts
of
sales
which
concededly
occur
in
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
were
citing
some
cases
where
you
say
that
you
have
to
show
what
percentage
is
the
payroll
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction
is
to
the
payroll
elsewhere,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
i
was
asking
you
if
that
kind
of
analysis
hasn’t
been
more
commonly
applied
to
the
situation
where
the
taxing
jurisdiction
seeks
to
tax
gross
income
period,
not
simply
gross
sales
which
concededly
occur
within
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
typical
solicitor
or
drummer
case
that
was
a
man
who
didn’t
reside
in
the
state,
wasn’t
he,
he
was
just
a
transient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
if
mart
--
if
martinson
had
just
flown
in
one
day
a
week
and
done
everything
that
he
did
from
a
place
in
california
that
the
state’s
case
would
be
just
as
strong
as
it
is
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
your
answer
to
the
commerce
aspect
of
the
thing
as
opposed
to
the
due
process
aspect
is
not
apportionment
but
to
limit
the
levy
to
the
state
of
destination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cornell,
do
you
think
washington
could
have
levied
a
use
tax
on
boeing
on
the
screws
and
fasteners
that
they
bought
from
your
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
do
you
think
in
this
case?
