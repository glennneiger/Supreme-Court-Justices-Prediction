mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
appellant,
standard
pressed
steel
co.
from
a
final
decision
of
the
washington
court
of
appeals
sustaining
the
assessment
of
the
washington
business
and
occupations
acts
on
appellant
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
wholesaling
activity
within
the
state
of
washington.
the
washington
state
supreme
court
declined
review
in
this
case.
the
tax
is
measured
by
unapportioned
gross
receipts
resulting
from
sales
or
products
manufactured
outside
of
the
state
and
sold
to
washington
customers.
the
basic
questions
in
this
cause
are
very
simply
stated
to,
are
appellant’s
activities
within
the
state
of
washington
sufficient
to
justify
the
imposition
of
the
subject
tax?
and
two,
is
the
tax
constitutionally
defective
as
applied
to
appellant
and
that
it
is
measured
by
gross
receipts
derived
largely
from
activities
occurring
outside
of
the
state
of
washington?
appellant
is
a
pennsylvania
corporation
with
facilities
located
in
pennsylvania
and
california.
the
in-state
activity
conducted
in
washington
was
conducted
solely
by
appellant’s
resident
employee
in
the
state
of
washington
who
received
a
salary
for
his
services,
a
flat
fee
and
worked
out
of
a
portion
of
one
room
of
his
home
and
i
think
since
the
general
principles
in
this
tax
scenario
are
rather
easy
to
state
but
i
believe
rather
difficult
to
apply
to
particular
fact
situations.
it
might
be
well
to
review
the
facts
briefly.
mr.
martinson’s
activity
in
the
state
of
washington
as
far
as
the
customer
is
concerned
brought
him
into
context
solely
with
boeing
qualification
engineers.
his
primary
function,
was
to,
through
this
contact
become
aware
of
boeing’s
possible
needs
for
appellant’s
products
and
to
forward
this
information
together
with
boeing
specifications
on
that
product
to
the
out-of-state
offices
where
if
the
decision
were
made
to
attempt
to
qualify
as
an
approved
boeing
source
in
this
product,
sample
pieces
would
be
manufactured
and
submitted
to
the
boeing
qualification
engineers
who
would
conduct
tests
and
evaluate
the
product
and
if
it
met
boeing’s
minimum
specifications,
appellant
would
be
approved
as
a
qualified
source
for
the
product
and
sales
negotiations
and
sales
promotion
would
then
ensue
which
could
possibly
lead
to
a
sale.
as
reflected
by
the
record,
competing
companies
would
also
have
qualified
in
many
cases
on
particular
parts
and
they
would
also
be
attempting
to
negotiate
sales
as
well.
appellant’s
resident
employee
is
not
involved
in
the
sales
negotiation
or
sales
promotion
at
any
time,
rather
he’s
bypassed
completely.
all
of
these
activities
take
place
and
occur
with
appellant’s
employees
located
outside
of
the
state
in
pennsylvania
and
california.
mr.
martinson’s
activities
also
and
this
is
approximately
10%
of
his
time,
the
duties
i
just
mentioned
consumed
approximately
90%
of
his
time.
the
remaining
portion
of
his
time
was
spent
in
what
the
state
has
characterized
as
a
problem-solving
process.
in
this
regard,
if
boeing
experienced
a
problem
in
the
use
of
one
of
appellant’s
products,
mr.
martinson
would
be
contacted
and
he
in
turn
would
forward
this
information
to
the
out-of-state
employees
of
appellant
who
would
resolve
the
problem
and
martinson
would
present
the
solution
to
the
boeing
engineers.
two
cases,
i
believe
which
are
probably
the
most
closely
in
point
on
this
issue
involve
general
motors
corporation
versus
washington
where
this
court
considered
the
same
text
in
washington
on
different
facts
and
norton
company
versus
department
of
revenue.
the
decision
below,
the
court
below
and
the
state
have
placed
heavy
reliance
on
the
general
motors
decision
and
i
believe
it
represents
the
furthest
extension
of
the
ability
of
a
state
to
tax
which
has
been
sustained
by
this
court
as
regards
to
an
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
and
the
state
has
characterized
the
basic
issue
before
this
court
as
whether
or
not
the
general
motors
decision
can
be
factually
distinguished
on
a
constitutional
basis
from
the
present
case.
in
this
regard,
the
general
motors
decision
can
be
distinguished
in
several
significant
respects.
first
and
i
think
the
most
critical
distinguishing
factor
was
that
general
motors
maintained
in
washington
a
very
large
and
substantial
intrastate
business
making
sales
to
washington
customers
on
which
he
had
voluntarily
paid
the
washington
business
and
occupation
tax.
additionally,
general
motors
made
sales
on
interstate
commerce
which
the
court
indicated
would
not
be
subject
to
the
tax
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
this
intrastate
business.
when
the
court
held
that
because
of
the
existence
of
the
intrastate
business,
and
because
the
general
motors
had
mingled
its
interstate
sales
with
the
intrastate
business
that
the
burden
was
on
the
taxpayer
to
show
that
the
activities
of
the
intrastate
business
were
not
associated
with
the
sales
on
interstate
commerce.
and
further
to
show
that
such
activities
were
not
decisive
factors
in
establishing
and
maintaining
the
market
for
the
interstate
sales.
on
the
case
at
bar,
it’s
an
undisputed
fact
and
it’s
clear
from
the
record
that
there’s
no
question,
there
is
no
intrastate
business
per
se
in
the
same
terms
as
general
motors
making
sales
to
washington
customers
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
general
motors
decision
is
further
distinguishable
in
that
general
motors
in
channeling
its
interstate
sales
through
the
local
outlet
gained
the
advantages
of
a
local
business
and
the
court
held
that
interstate
sales
cannot
be
channeled
through
a
local
business
so
that
the
advantages
of
local
commerce
are
obtained
and
still
maintained
immunity
as
to
the
sales
on
interstate
commerce.
in
this
regard,
i
think
it
should
be
apparent
that
there
would
be
delivery
in
communication
problems
for
example
which
a
washington
customer
would
face
in
dealing
with
appellant
that
would
not
be
present
were
a
local
business
present
within
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
no
they
did
not.
now
i
think
that
the
kind
of
taxes
is
imposed
by
the
state
of
washington
here
because
of
its,
i
think
it’s
an
unwise
economic
policy,
it’s
a
very
tough
tax,
very
few
states
imposed
this
kind
of
a
tax
and
therefore
pennsylvania
and
california
do
not
impose
a
tax
measured
by
gross
receipts.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
yes
and
other
washington
customers
although
we
are
contacted
solely
with
boeing.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
oh,
yes,
i
am.
apportionment
comes
up
in
several
different
ways
in
the
court’s
language.
is
the
state
taxing
activities
which
occur
outside
of
the
state?
is
the
tax
such
that
the
state
is
exacting
more
than
a
fair
return
and
my
brief
does
raise
the
apportionment
question
but
i
think
many
of
the
principles
really
come
down
to
--
can
be
said
in
many
different
ways.
it
comes
down
to
one
point,
is
it
fair
in
this
case
and
is
it
in
violation
of
both
due
process
and
the
commerce
clause
to
impose
an
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
on
a
business
whose
--
where
the
gross
receipts
are
derived
largely
from
activities
occurring
outside
of
the
state?
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
that’s
a
difficult
question.
for
example
this
court
in
the
general
motors
versus
district
of
columbia
case,
while
it
hesitated
to
get
into
the
apportionment,
i
believe
did
mention
that
there
are
instances
where
payroll
for
example
is
measured.
the
payroll
by
washington
employees
would
be
prorated
or
compared
with
the
payroll
of
employees
outside
of
the
state
also
involved
in
these
sales
and
i
believe
there
are
other
factors
as
well.
property
located
within
the
state,
although
in
this
case,
there
is
no
property
located
within
the
state
and
there
never
was.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
i
don’t
believe
i
follow
your
question.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
yes,
i
think
that’s
correct,
i
believe
in
the
general
motors
district
of
columbia
case,
however,
that
all
of
the
income
they’re
being
taxed
was
resulted
from
sales
to
individuals
within
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
court
urged
apportionment
in
that
case
as
well
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
court’s
decision
striking
down
the
tax.
i
believe
that
the
general
motors
decision
is
further
distinguishable
in
arriving
at
whether
or
not
appellant’s
activities
in
washington
are
sufficient
local
incident
in
which
they
justify
the
tax
and
that
the
general
motors
personnel,
without
going
into
detail
engaged
in
substantial
sales
promotion
and
other
kinds
of
activity
in
the
state
of
washington
which
are
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
activities
of
appellant
in
washington
and
i
believe
it
strains
the
imagination
to
equate
the
activities
of
our
one
employee
with
a
bundle
of
corporate
activities
and
maze
of
local
connections
which
the
court
felt
were
present
in
the
general
motors
decision.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
yes,
he
did
a
portion
of
one
room.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
yes,
he
was
full
time.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
i
believe
if
i
recall
the
facts
correctly
that
there
was
an
answering
service
for
--
the
standard
pressed
steel
telephone
number
was
listed
in
the
telephone
book.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
no,
it
was
an
answering
service
and
the
answering
service
would
contact
this
man.
that
is
how
he
got
his
telephone
messages.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
not
in
the
state
of
washington,
no.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
he
would
either
--
many
of
the
exhibits
are
handwritten
and
at
least
my
copies
are
somewhat
illegible.
he
would
either
handwrite
them
or
on
occasion,
he
would
apparently
telephone
a
secretary
located
in
pennsylvania
or
california
who
would
type
the
message.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
it’s
not
cited
in
the
briefs.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
it’s
380
u.s.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
it’s
380
u.s.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
i
believe
also
that
the
nature
of
the
activities
conducted
by
appellant
in
washington
have
to
be
considered.
for
example,
the
general
motors
personnel.
they
were
involved
very
heavily
and
the
court
made
repeated
reference
to
the
intimate
relationship
between
general
motors
personnel
in
washington
in
the
washington
general
motors
decision
in
connection
with
the
dealer
organizations
within
the
state
of
washington
and
pointed
out
that
the
promotional
activities
in
that
case
were
the
nature
of
fostering
or
creating
a
consumer
need
or
demand
for
the
product
and
the
further
promotion
of
general
motors
parts,
products
or
services
as
being
superior
to
those
of
competitors
and
best
able
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
consumer.
there
is
no
similar
activity
which
takes
places
in
the
state
of
washington
in
this
case.
rather
the
activity
if
its
promotional
nature,
you
might
say
that
mr.
martinson’s
activities
do
assist
in
seeing
that
minimum
standards
for
boeing
are
met
so
that
the
possibility
of
sales
negotiations
taking
place
is
present.
the
norton
decision
i
believe
is
closer
in
point
on
the
facts
and
appellant
relies,
i
think
very
heavily
on
this
case
because
of
the
similarity
in
the
facts.
the
norton
company
again
just
like
the
general
motors
operation
in
washington
had
present
within
the
state
of
illinois
a
large
intrastate
outlet
making
sales
directly
to
illinois
consumers
and
on
which
it
voluntarily
paid
the
illinois
privilege
tax
measured
by
gross
receipts.
in
addition,
there
were
sales
and
interstate
commerce
which
the
court
indicated
would
not
be
subject
to
the
tax
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
the
local
intrastate
business
and
again
held
that
the
taxpayer
had
to
meet
the
burdens
of
showing
that
the
activities
of
the
intrastate
business
were
not
associated
with
the
sales
and
interstate
commerce
and
that
such
activities
were
not
decisive
factors
in
establishing
and
maintaining
the
market
for
interstate
sales.
and
again,
since
we
don’t
have
an
intrastate
business
here,
at
least
the
appellant
does
not
have
to
meet
this
same
kind
of
burden
in
this
case,
there
was
one
class
of
sales
and
interstate
commerce,
however,
which
this
court
held
was
exempt
and
these
were
a
direct
order
type
of
situation
and
the
court
held
there
that
it
was
beyond
the
realm
of
permissible
judgment
to
attribute
the
activities
of
the
intrastate
business
to
this
type
of
sale
and
therefore
these
sales
were
so
clearly
in
interstate
commerce
as
to
be
exempt
from
this
kind
of
a
tax.
similarly
in
the
present
clause,
all
orders
are
the
direct
order
type
and
i
believe
on
the
authority
of
norton,
are
exempt
from
this
kind
of
a
tax.
the
state
however,
and
the
court
below
focused
on
martinson,
his
presence
within
the
state
and
his
activities
but
in
this
regard,
as
i
read
the
norton
decision,
the
same
kinds
of
activities
were
conducted
by
norton
engineers
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
those
activities
were
not
a
sufficient
local
incident
to
justify
the
imposition
of
the
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
direct
order
type
of
sales.
we’re
told
for
example
that
the
norton
engineers
consulted
with
the
prospective
customers
as
to
their
needs
and
offered
technical
and
engineering
assistance
and
advice
in
the
use
of
the
norton
products
and
i
believe
these
activities
closely
parallel
the
activities
of
martinson
in
connection
with
the
qualification
duties
and
problem
solving
kinds
of
duties
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
martinson
was
not
an
engineer
as
such
and
--
but
his
activities
were
geared
toward
engineering
kinds
of
activities.
before
he
started
performing
his
duties,
appellant
did
give
him
training.
this
is
a
very
specialized
kind
of
business
involving
the
part
which
is
used
for
aerospace
fasteners
and
they’re
highly
machine
nuts,
bolts,
and
rivets
used
in
the
aerospace
industry
so
it
involves
a
very
narrow
area
of
engineering
.martinson
did
receive
training
initially.
martinson
also
received
ongoing
training.
he
cons
--
he
--
his
dealings
with
boeing
were
solely
with
boeing
engineers,
the
kinds
of
information
he
forwarded
onto
boeing
--
or
onto
appellant
concerned
engineering
kinds
of
things,
what
are
the
specifications
of
the
boeing
company
as
to
a
particular
product,
what
are
they
looking
for
here
and
i
think
would
require
some
engineering
knowledge.
i
believe
that
the
court
below
and
the
state
perhaps
have
confused
in-state
activity
with
an
in-state
business
and
the
two
are
not
synonymous
as
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
nippert
versus
richmond.
interstate
commerce
of
necessity
always
involves
activities
in
more
than
one
taxing
state
and
you
can
always
point
to
any
activity
as
some
sort
of
a
local
incident
but
the
question
is,
is
that
local
incident
sufficient
to
justify
the
imposition
of
the
tax.
and
i
believe
in
this
case
here,
well,
for
example
the
solicitor
case
is
involved
activities
within
a
state
attempting
to
impose
a
tax
but
that
activity
is
not
a
sufficient
local
incident
on
which
to
justify
the
imposition
of
the
tax.
i
believe
the
circumstances
in
the
case
at
bar
here
present
an
even
clearer
case
for
exemption
then
would
exists
in
the
norton
decision
because
there
is
no
local
intrastate
business
present
here
and
i
think
it
makes
the
court
work
somewhat
easier
in
deciding
this
case
than
faced
in
the
norton
decision.
appellant
would
also
submit
that
the
solicitor
cases
support
appellant’s
position
in
this
cause
and
in
this
regard,
i
would
submit
that
the
activities
of
traveling
salesmen
in
washington
would
be
a
far
more
substantial
activity,
far
more
instrumental
in
bringing
about
sales
to
washington
customers
than
the
activities
of
martinson
in
washington.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
well,
he
may
and
in
this
regard,
i
believe
justice
douglas
complained
in
his
dissent
to
the
nippert
versus
richmond
case
that
the
decision
would
apply
equally
to
resident
or
nonresident
traveling
salesmen
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
fact
of
residency
also
would
be
a
significant
factor
because
that
doesn’t
pertain
to
their
activities.
the
same
activities
could
take
place
in
a
taxing
state
whether
or
not
they
are
a
resident
of
that
state
that
would
be
a
mere
coincidence.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
i
think
it
might
as
strong
or
as
weak
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it.
i
think
basically,
it
would
be
the
same
case
because
the
contact
would
be
--
and
this
is
a
distinguishing
point
i
believe
from
the
solicitor
cases
as
to
a
particular
customer
here,
the
context
are
i
believe,
systematic
and
continuous
and
i
think
we
would
have
to
concede
on
that
point
and
i
believe
if
you
flew
in
every
week
to
meet
with
the
customer
that
that
would
be
a
systematic
and
continuous
contact
but
the
nature
of
the
activities
i
think
in
the
case
of
a
traveling
salesman
in
terms
of
exploiting
the
entire
washington
market
and
making
sales
to
washington
customers
would
be
a
far
more
significant
kind
of
activity
than
the
activity
of
martinson.
while
there’s
a
systematic
and
continuous
contact,
we
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
his
activities
and
what
is
he
doing,
what
does
he
have
to
offer
boeing
here.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
yes,
in
many
of
the
cases
in
which
a
tax
has
not
been
sustained
by
this
court
have
involved
what
you
might
call
continuous
and
systematic
kinds
of
activities
within
a
state
but
again,
it’s
the
type
of
activity
and
it’s
perhaps
the
extent
of
the
activity
within
the
taxing
state
that
is
the
governing
factor
in
all
of
these
cases.
cases
where
this
kind
of
a
tax
has
been
sustained
involve
clearly
localized
activity
such
as
manufacturing
where
you
have
a
sales
office
through
which
sales
are
channeled.
martinson
here
does
not
have
any
participation
in
sales.
he
does
not
promote
the
product
and
sales
are
not
being
channeled
through
his
office.
if
you
wish
to
contact
the
consumer,
the
customer
or
i’m
sorry,
the
manufacturer
or
the
seller,
you
have
to
call
them
generally
in
pennsylvania
and
there
are
time
factors
which
make
that
communication
somewhat
difficult.
it’s
not
face
to
face
and
appellant
has
chosen
to
operate
on
this
basis,
an
interstate
commerce
and
to
accept
the
competitive
disadvantages
which
flow
from
them
because
they
are
operating
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
well,
the
money
involved
is
a
stipulated
amount
before
this
court.
it’s
about
$34,000.00
roughly.
the
state
has
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
january
1
of
1965
through
june
30
of
1969.
in
addition,
there
is
another
assessment.
this
is
not
in
the
record
which
was
assessed
up
to
the
time
that
standard
pressed
steel
decided
to
avoid
further
hassle
at
least
until
this
case
is
decided
they
pulled
their
man
out
and
so
there’s
an
assessment
up
to
the
point
he
is
terminated
which
was
about
the
time
his
deposition
was
taken
and
there’s
no
further
assessment
so
there
is
a
greater
dollar
amount
involved
that
would
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
i
can
presume
that
there
probably
are
who
would
be
operating
in
some
sort
of
a
similar
capacity
and
of
course,
appellant
would
like
to
operate
in
this
way
in
the
future
as
well
so
it
does
have
an
impact
on
them
that
would
go
beyond
the
amount
of
the
dollars
involved
in
this
case.
appellant
in
this
case
would
concede
of
course
as
has
been
stated
by
this
court
in
many
different
occasions
that
the
state
can
exact
a
fair
return
for
benefits
provided
and
according
to
the
level
of
activity
occurring
within
the
state
and
the
same
rule
of
course,
should
be
applied
here
but
in
this
regard,
i
would
point
out
two
things.
first
of
all,
an
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
does
not
make
any
allowance
for
activities
occurring
outside
of
the
state
and
in
this
case,
where
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
activity
occurring
outside
of
the
state
from
which
these
gross
receipts
are
derived.
in
this
case,
i
think
by
the
very
nature
and
incidence
of
the
tax,
the
same
tax
is
payable
whether
or
not
all
these
activities
take
place
within
the
state.
there
are
taxes
if
they
do
take
place
within
the
state.
the
state
here
is
exacting
more
than
a
fair
return.
there
are
also
always
benefits
provided
to
any
business
including
a
business
operating
in
interstate
commerce
and
i
would
submit
here
that
the
benefits
given
by
the
state
are
no
more
substantial
in
this
case
than
would
be
supplied
in
the
solicitor
cases,
perhaps
general
motors
versus
district
of
columbia,
other
cases
involving
the
taxes
being
struck
down
because
of
a
failure
to
properly
apportion.
evco
versus
jones
are
very
recent
case
decided
by
this
court
1972.
it’s
recent
in
the
context
of
this
kind
of
a
situation.
where
the
court
there
in
citing
from
j.d.
adams
manufacturing
company
versus
storen
presenting
a
quote
and
i
believe
the
quote
is
of
some
benefit
to
this
case
said
that,
“the
vice
of
a
statute
as
applied
to
receipts
from
interstate
sales
is
that
the
tax
includes
in
its
measure,
without
apportionment,
receipts
derived
from
activities
in
interstate
commence;
and
that
the
exaction
is
of
such
a
character
that
if
lawful
it
may
be
in
substance
laid
to
the
fullest
extent
by
states
in
which
those
goods
are
sold”
here
that
would
be
washington
“as
well
as
those
in
which
they
are
manufactured”
which
would
be
pennsylvania
or
california.
“interstate
commerce
would
thus
be
subjected
to
the
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden
to
which
intrastate
commerce
is
not
exposed,
and
which
the
commerce
clause
forbids.”
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
so
i’ll
end
my
remarks
now
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
thank
you.
concerning
the
attorney
general’s
approach
that
favoring
the
destination
state
and
not
allowing
the
market
state
to
tax
or
to
avoid
multiple
taxation
to
me
is
incredible.
he
talks
about
a
state
being
able
to
exact
their
fair
share.
the
state
of
washington
here
wants
their
share
plus
pennsylvania’s
and
california’s.
sales
activity
occurs
there.
what
he
is
saying
is
that
in
those
states,
standard
pressed
steel
should
not
have
to
pay
its
fair
share.
the
gross
receipts
tax
cannot
apply.
to
me,
this
flies
in
the
face
of
the
doctrine
that
interstate
commerce
must
pay
its
own
way.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
well,
the
attorney
general’s
position
is
that
to
avoid
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation
in
case
of
such
as
this
where
you
have
activities
occurring
in
two
states
from
which
the
gross
receipts
are
derived,
that
the
easy
solution
is
to
give
the
destination
state
the
ability
to
tax
and
deny
the
market
state
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
no,
i
do
not.
i’m
talking
now
about
the
ability
to
tax.
i
believe
that
pennsylvania
or
california
wanted
to
impose
such
a
tax
that
they
could.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
no,
i
do
not.
the
cases
cited
for
that
proposition
are
--
the
taxes
struck
down
there
are
struck
down
because
of
the
failure
to
properly
apportion
between
the
destination
state
and
the
market
state.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
well,
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
i
believe
they
can
your
honor
and
i
hesitate
to
differ
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
evco
versus
jones
cases
where
i
pointed
out
the
quote
from
adams
manufacturing
company
versus
storen.
that
quote
pointed
out
that
the
problem
was
an
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
and
the
reason
that
tax
was
struck
down
is
not
something
to
do
with
destination
state
versus
market
state
but
rather
the
tax
was
not
fairly
apportioned
between
those
states.
there
does
seem
to
be
a
coincidence
in
several
of
the
cases
that
the
market
state
has
not
been
allowed
to
impose
an
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
but
i
believe
that’s
a
mere
coincidence
on
the
basis
of
those
decisions,
i
think
that
it
clearly
pointing
out
the
apportionment
and
both
states
do
have
the
right.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
no.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
that
would
be
a
much
different
case.
i
think
that
would
involve
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
the
apportionment
argument
would
be
much
the
same.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
it
would
depend
on
how,
i
think
how
much
activity
occurs
outside
of
the
taxing
state
in
relation
to
the
activity
occurring
within
the
taxing
state.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
well,
the
use
does
take
place
within
the
state
and
i
believe
that
is
a
--
for
example
the
sales
tax
cases
make
it
very
clear
that
there
could
be
no
burden
of
multiple
taxation
because
the
sale
takes
place
in
a
particular
state
and
i
believe
it
was
nippert
versus
richmond
where
that
was
a
very
key
fact,
where
did
the
sale
take
place.
that’s
the
state
that
can
impose
the
sales
tax
and
in
the
use
tax
case,
the
same
inquiry
would
be
made
of
the
same
governing
factor
would
have
to
be
present.
where
is
the
use?
mr.
kenneth
l.
cornell
i
think
since
the
use
takes
place
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
state
of
washington
could
impose
a
use
tax.
