well
on
that
basis,
if
washington
could
charge
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
any
sales
made
to
local
residents
whether
there
are
any
employees
of
the
seller
in
the
state
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
that
right?
i
mean
your
argument
would
be
just
as
good
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
just
it
would
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
is
you’re
not
trying
to
collect
it
from
the
buyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
collecting
it
from
a
local
citizen
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
using
some
property
that
was
bought
out
--
bought
somewhere
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
ultimately
--
and
its
ultimate
burden
if
the
seller
doesn’t
pay
is
on
the
buyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn’t
literally
purport
to
be
on
an
interstate
sale?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
purports
to
be
specifically
on
interstate
sale?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
measured
by
the
gross
receipts
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
this
concededly
an
interstate
--
aren’t
these
sales
concededly
interstate
sales?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
net
income
tax
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
mcgoldrick
case
was
long
before
norton
and
norton
specifically
cited
mcgoldrick
as
being
quite
distinguishable
and
i’m
not
sure
mcgoldrick
is
much
help
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
talking
about
the
one
of
309
u.s.,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
one
that
norton
cited?
that’s
the
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
distinguish
the
sales
tax
situation,
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
norton
tax
was
on
the
seller,
that’s
what
point
it
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
--
you
do
think
that
we
must
then
disavow
norton?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
that
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
justice
goldberg
cited
in
norton
as
dictating
a
different
result,
the
court
arrived
at
in
norton,
norton
said
not
so
in
those
cases
in
the
mcgoldrick
type
case
is
not
controlling
here.
now
you
can
call
that
dictum
if
you
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
your
client
maintained
the
warehouse
or
the
sales
of
the
warehouse
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
know
but
would
you
object
to
this
particular
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
i
know
but
your
apportionment
argument
ought
to
be
much
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
able
to
make
it
would
you?
