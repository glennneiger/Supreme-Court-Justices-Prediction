mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
take
it
to
the
crux
of
the
argument
we're
having
today
is
really
the
impact
of
the
1974
amendments
upon
the
fair
labor
--
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
upon
state
in
local
government
sovereignty
or
to
put
another
way
upon
the
system
of
federalism
established
by
the
constitution.
i
think
the
issue
therefore
is
whether
maryland
against
wirtz
should
be
overruled
in
the
position
of
the
dissent
there
become
the
new
law.
i
intended
about
myself
primarily
to
that
question
because
the
preliminary
matters
seemed
to
me
to
be
too
plain
to
require
much
additional
extended
discussion.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
mr.
chief
justice.
this
does
not
--
the
statute
does
not
require
state
to
give
up
any
payments
or
any
number
of
policemen
and
firemen
state
if
it
does
financially
pinch.
and
i
think
it
will
not
for
reason
that
will
come
too
can
give
a
peripheral
services
which
are
not
inherently
governmental,
which
in
no
sense
of
the
word
are
inherently
governmental.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it's
not
the
business
that
congress
of
united
states
to
tell
them
what
they
must
give
up
and
the
statute
is
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
i
think
in
the
first
place
mr.
chief
justice,
i
failed
to
see
the
wound
for
reasons
i
will
develop.
but
in
the
second
place,
i
think
this
is
a
very
unintrusive
statute,
much
less
intrusive
than
many
kind
of
statutes
that
are
concededly
valid
under
the
commerce
power.
as
we've
said,
this
statute
does
not
tell
a
state
that
it
must
give
up
any
objective
or
that
it
must
pursue
any
substantive
object
or
any
program.
it
leaves
the
state
free
entirely
to
choose
all
of
its
programs,
keep
them
all
abandon
anyone
that
sees
fit,
but
it
does
not
have
any
policy
control
over
the
states
as
many
federal
statutes
do
which
are
valid
into
the
commerce
clause.
but
i
thought
i
would
spend
a
moment
upon
the
commerce
clause
predicate
here
before
coming
to
the
issue
of
whether
federalism
isn't
some
sense
threatened.
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
interstate
commerce
is
involved
when
state
and
local
governments
in
1971
purchased
goods
and
services
worth
$135
billion
which
was
at
that
time
12%
of
our
gross
national
product,
and
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
a
significance
of
these
1974
amendments
to
interstate
commerce
when
we
realized
that
they
extend
the
coverage
of
the
act
to
an
additional
3.4
million
state
and
local
government
employees.
the
1966
amendments
upheld
in
maryland
against
wirtz
extended
the
coverage
to
2.9
million
employees,
so
that
there
are
now
a
total
of
6.3
million
employees
protected
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
there
are
variety
of
reasons
why
this
wage
is
an
hours
long
is
rationally
related
to
congress's
power
to
control
commerce.
now,
i'm
really
sketch
because
i
think
they've
been
upheld
in
so
many
decisions
of
this
court
that
they
need
not
be
argued
at
length.
but
first
of
course
is
simply
that
substandard
working
conditions
can
lead
to
labor
disputes
which
interrupt
the
flow
of
goods
and
services
across
state
lines.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
what
i
meant
mr.
justice
rehnquist
when
i
said
i
would
spend
just
a
moment
on
the
predicate
treating
this
as
a
commerce
power
case
before
we
come
to
the
special
problem,
appellant's
raise
about
the
fact
to
the
state
and
local
government.
that
labor
strife
theory
of
course
is
in
the
congressional
findings
in
the
original
act.
it
is
a
basis
for
this
court
upholding
the
1966
amendments
and
their
application
to
state
and
local
government
in
maryland
against
wirtz.
it
was
advanced
by
senator
javits
in
debate
in
advancing
the
1974
amendments
and
of
course
it
is
the
theory
under
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
--
national
labor
relations
act
was
upheld
in
jones
against
laughlin.
competition
again
between
governmental
units
and
private
industry
which
is
required
to
comply
with
the
labor
standards
act
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
third,
competition
between
governments
exist
and
if
some
government
is
used
substandard
labor
conditions
and
compete
with
other
governments
for
new
industries,
new
residence
tourist
and
rather
than
raise
taxes
lower
working
conditions,
they
will
tend
to
spread
those
working
conditions
to
other
governments
that
are
trying
to
compete
for
the
same
industries
and
rather
than
for
tourist.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
brief,
amicus
curiae
filed
by
the
state
of
alabama,
colorado,
michigan,
and
minnesota,
states
who
apparently
feel
that
their
sovereignty
is
not
seriously
threatened
here.
and
at
pages
six
and
seven
of
that
brief
which
i
will
not
go
through,
they
explained
the
competition
between
governments
and
why
that
competition
justifies
the
kind
of
statute
amendments
we
have
here.
and
particularly,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
advertisements
in
the
appendix
which
showed
the
state
of
massachusetts
advertising
in
the
sunday
new
york
times
in
march
of
this
year
to
attract
industry
with
tax
incentives
and
the
state
of
new
york
advertising
in
fortune
magazine
with
tax
incentives.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
the
only
--
what
i
meant
by
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
simply
this.
it
says
“a
state
may
follow
any
policy
it
wishes.”
the
only
thing
--
only
limitation
upon
that
is
that
any
policy
it
wishes
to
follow
may
not
be
done
at
the
expense
of
workers
being
paid
substandard
wages.
but,
it
does
not
attempt
to
dictate
the
policy
that
must
be
followed
or
tell
the
state
that
it
must
eliminate
any
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
were
two
briefs
file.
the
original
one,
it's
the
identical
brief.
all
it
happened
is
in
the
second
filing
and
the
state
of
minnesota
was
added,
it's
alabama,
colorado,
michigan,
minnesota.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
red
brief,
there
were
two
red
brief
filed.
they
are
identical
as
i
far
as
i
can
see.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
both
red,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
fourth
theory
that
supports
the
commerce
power
here
of
course
is
the
one
cited
in
katzenbach
against
mcclung
which
is
that
the
increase
in
purchasing
power
that
follows
from
a
setting
a
floor
upon
wages
and
so
forth
does
benefit
interstate
commerce.
and
finally
of
course,
congress
believed
as
the
senate
report
said
that
raising
a
minimum
wage
rate
at
a
level
which
at
least
helps
to
assure
the
worker
a
decent
income
at
or
above
the
poverty
level
is
essential
to
the
reduction
of
welfare
roles
and
overall
reform
of
the
welfare
system
in
united
states.
and
i
would
think
that
obviously
spreading
the
work
through
overtime
requirements
and
requiring
minimum
wages
is
a
way
of
getting
people
off
welfare
roles
and
train
as
productive
workers
and
that's
so
obvious
importance
to
interstate
commerce.
but
these
considerations,
these
various
theories
and
so
many
times
accepted
by
this
court
and
so
overwhelmingly
support
that
commerce
clause
predicate
of
the
74
amendments
that
i
think
the
real
argument,
and
the
one
i
was
spend
my
time
on
is
the
argument
about
federalism.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
of
course
that
states
enjoy
no
absolute
immunity
from
commerce
clause
regulation.
and
the
cases
to
that
effect
recited
in
both
the
majority
and
to
dissent
in
maryland
against
wirtz
and
in
fact
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
commerce
clause
maybe
use
to
regulate
what
one
might
think
of
as
an
essential
governmental
function,
similar
to
fire
or
police
protection.
for
example,
in
sanitary
district
against
united
states,
chicago
was
prohibited
under
the
federal
power
to
control
navigation
and
aspect
of
commerce
from
diverting
water
from
lake
michigan
in
order
to
carry
away
sewage,
which
i
would
think
is
an
essential
governmental
function.
the
real
argument
is
not
that
there
is
an
essential
governmental
function
that
may
not
be
touched.
it's
that
these
amendments
are
swipe
so
broadly
and
has
such
an
impact
that
they
imperil
state
sovereignty
and
on
entire
constitutional
system
of
federalism.
now,
that
contention
is
advanced
here
in
very
hided
terms,
indeed
in
apocalyptic
terms
so
that
at
first
glance,
one
might
think
that
this
was
very
serious
constitutional
case.
but
i
think
upon
calm
analysis,
it
would
be
seen
that
the
only
substance
to
the
appellant's
argument
here
is
a
mixture
of
misunderstanding
of
the
statute
and
a
capacity
for
unlimited
hyperbole.
appellants
asked
this
court
to
overrule
maryland
against
wirtz
and
i
will
not
dwell
upon
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis,
more
will
i
dwell
upon
the
reliance
of
congress
and
a
variety
of
individuals
upon
the
1966
amendments
and
upon
maryland
against
wirtz,
although
those
are
obvious
factors
which
support
the
appellee
secretary
of
labor
here.
but
i
want
to
go
to
the
policy
question
and
i
want
to
speak
the
constitutional
policy
question,
and
i
want
to
speak
to
those
issues
under
the
constitution
which
indicate
that
maryland
against
wirtz
should
be
followed.
the
question
raised
by
the
dissent
in
maryland
against
wirtz
and
i
take
it,
it
is
the
same
question
being
raised
the
appellants
here,
is
does
this
federal
regulation
overwhelmed
state
fiscal
policy?
does
the
principle
that
must
necessarily
underlie
the
validity
of
the
1974
amendments
permit
the
congress
virtually
to
draw
up
each
state's
budget?
the
answer
to
that
i
think
is
unqualifiedly
no.
it
does
not.
the
commerce
power
does
not
permit
the
congress
to
destroy
federalism.
federalism
is
also
a
constitutional
principle.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
wouldn't
choose
the
word
concession
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
affirm
it.
congress
could
--
under
the
commerce
power,
i
take
it,
perhaps
nationalize
private
--
much
of
private
industry
with
compensation
of
course,
but
they
could
nationalize.
i
take
it
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
could
not
takeover
state
government
and
make
the
states
merely
administrative
satrapies.
there's
no
doubt
it.
and
if
this
case
involved
anything
like
that,
appellants
would
have
a
very
strong
point
and
this
case
involves
nothing
of
the
sort
so
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
i
understand
that
the
states
of
--
pardon
me,
municipalities,
the
budget
is
80%
to
85%
wages.
however,
the
affect
of
these
amendments
upon
that
share
of
the
budget
is
under
2%
which
means
that
we're
talking
about
less
than
2%
of
80%
to
85%
of
the
budget.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
correct.
the
best
estimates,
minimum
wage
law
and
overtime
regulation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
believed
california's
figure
was
70%.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we
said
76%
and
then
the
brief
says
70%.
i
forget
to
--
that
part
matters
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
take
it
that's
for
state.
it
reaches
into
in
the
sense
that
it
applies
to
about
half
of
the
state
employees
now,
and
it
will
have
an
effect
upon
80%
to
85%
of
the
state
budget,
but
i
don't
regard
that
as
a
meaningful
figure
because
the
effect
that
will
have
is
very
slight.
it
spread
very
thinly
across
a
large
part
of
the
state
budget.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
think
there's
a
variety
of
things
to
prevent
that.
one
thing
that
prevents
it
is
that
i
--
and
this
is
not
my
whole
answer,
but
i
think
it
is
a
realistic
answer
of
those
worth
giving,
is
the
political
makeup
of
congress.
congress
is
drawing
from
the
states.
state
parties
are
quite
powerful,
so
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
there
is.
i
think
there
is.
i
was
--
the
practical
political
consideration
i
regard
is
constitutional
in
the
broader
sense
the
way
our
political
parties
and
our
nation
is
constituted.
we
have
a
structural
protection
against
that
kind
of
thing
happening.
the
second
line
in
constitutional
in
the
constitutional
law
sense
is
of
course
this
court
and
i
think
if
this
court
ever
sees
that
states
are
being
deprived
of
political
autonomy
so
that
they
are
no
longer
variable
policy
choosing
and
policy
making
centers,
this
court
can
say
the
value
of
federalism
is
being
impaired
and
strike
down
the
statute
involved.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
can
make
a
principle
decision
only
in
this
sense
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
when
this
court
has
over
the
centuries
attempted
to
find
a
formula
for
confining
the
commerce
clause,
they
have
never
found
an
adequate
formula.
i
suggest
to
you
that
you
will
never
find
a
mechanical
bright
line
distinction
which
will
tell
the
congress,
you
may
do
this
to
the
states
but
you
may
not
do
that.
it
is
necessarily
as
in
many
constitutional
matters
are
question
of
degree,
a
question
of
balancing.
and
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
not
unprincipled
to
make
judgments
of
degree
to
say
there
is
a
spectrum
here
and
we
will
cut
it
at
this
point.
that
i
think
is
not
unprincipled
and
that
i
think
is
the
only
kind
of
test
that's
available
in
this
area.
that
i
think
is
not
unprincipled
and
that
i
think
is
the
only
kind
of
test
it's
available
in
this
area.
but
let
me
--
in
approaching
this
matter
and
in
showing
why
if
this
court
were
to
draw
a
line
and
say
“we're
going
to
strike
down
a
statute
of
congress
to
preserve
federalism”,
i
would
think
that
this
statute
would
be
one
of
the
last
choices
this
court
would
make.
there
are
other
statutes
which
this
court
is
upheld,
which
i
think
are
far
more
intrusive
upon
federalism
than
this
statute
for
reasons
i
will
develop.
but
i
would
like
to
add
a
dash
of
realism
to
the
discussion
so
far
just
to
put
the
matter
in
perspective.
and
the
first
point
about
that
is
that
it
is
true
that
the
federal
government
contributes
far,
far
more
to
the
state's
budgets
then
this
major
will
ever
cost
them?
in
1975,
the
federal
aid,
the
state
and
local
government
is
expected
the
total
of
$52
billion.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
can
stop
that
anytime
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
realistically,
in
terms
of
the
drastic
impact,
we're
being
asked
to
see
here.
this
is
not
much
of
--
and
in
fact,
i
would
suppose
the
kinds
of
conditions
upon
employment
here
could
have
been
added
as
conditions
to
the
grants.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
it
does
it
only
in
the
sense.
we
have
heard
this
morning
extensive
argument
about
policy
issues
and
congress
shouldn't
do
this
because
it's
going
to
cost
us
the
following
amounts
of
money.
i
agree
that
those
arguments
perhaps
have
been
addressed
by
the
appellants
to
congress
rather
than
to
this
court
because
they
are
not
constitutional
arguments
as
they
were
put.
but
i
think
it's
relevant
at
least
in
counter
balancing
that
to
realize
that
we're
talking
about
a
fair
labor
standards
act
which
will
have
less
than
2%
impact
upon
a
state
budget
and
the
figure
i
just
cited
means
that
the
federal
government
is
financing
about
22%
of
state
and
local
expenditures,
so
that
--
this
1974
amendments
are
not
as
matters
now
stand
going
to
swamp
any
fiscal
policy
that
they
hardly
begin
to
measure
up
to
what
the
federal
government
pays
for
the
states
and
local
governments.
the
other
item
of
realism
that
i
would
like
to
object,
they
inject
is
at
this
cry
of
the
destruction,
the
immanent
destruction
of
federalism
has
been
raised
in
this
court
in
commerce
clause
cases
ever
since
john
marshall
was
chief
justice
and
i
think
it's
no
more
accurate
here
than
it
was
in
gibbons
against
ogden.
one
of
the
more
recent
points
of
examples
of
this
kind
of
rhetoric
appeared
in
fact
in
the
plaintiff's
states
brief
in
this
court
in
maryland
against
wirtz.
i
enjoy
this
particular
line.
the
states
then
said
in
maryland
against
wirtz,
pardon
me,
ever
before
in
the
history
of
this
nation
has
the
federal
government
presumed
to
enact
the
law
which
both
in
theory
and
in
practice,
serves
as
the
basis
for
the
other
destruction
of
the
state
as
a
sovereign
political
entity.
now
that
rhetoric
so
closely
resembles
the
rhetoric
of
the
briefs
here
and
of
the
oral
argument
here
that
i
begin
to
think
that
perhaps
it
must
be
a
boiler
plate
somewhere
for
resisting
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
a
camel's
head
in
the
tenth
kind
of
argument
impart,
impart
the
briefs
refer
to
this
as
--
and
the
oral
argument
does
as
massive
takeover,
complete
user
patient,
etcetera,
etcetera,
which
i
take
it
as
not
camel's
nose,
i
think
it
is
the
whole
camel.
but
then
they
back
off
and
say,
well,
it
is
camel's
nose
because
if
you
allow
this,
then
you
must
go
all
the
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
every
time
a
commerce
clause
regulation
is
passed
more
of
--
of
any
kind,
more
of
that
camel
is
in
tenth,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
this
statute
is
less
intrusive
than
most
of
the
other
kinds
of
federal
regulations
under
the
commerce
clause,
upon
the
area
of
state
sovereignty
than
the
other
kinds
are.
and
therefore,
if
one
is
looking
for
--
is
calibrating
the
camel's
nose
for
the
danger
point,
one
would
not
choose
this
statute
as
a
place
to
see
the
danger
point.
but
hardly
enough,
despite
this
rhetoric
in
maryland
against
wirtz
or
should
i
say
so
closely
parallel
as
a
rhetoric
here,
if
the
states
were
not
destroyed,
they
were
not
even
damaged,
and
i
take
it
there,
they
seem
to
be
healthier
in
many
ways
than
they
were
at
that
time.
so
i
think
just
in
terms
of
the
rhetoric
we're
talking
about
and
in
terms
of
the
money
we're
talking
about,
i
mentioned
this
merely
to
suggest
that
the
appellant's
argument
about
the
imminent
fall
of
the
republic
is
entitled
to
be
taking
with
a
large
dollop
of
skepticism.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
just
three
points
about
federalism.
first,
in
enacting
these
1974
amendments,
congress
was
very
responsible,
went
to
a
very
responsible
process
and
indeed
it
was
very
sensitive
to
state
and
local
problems
and
to
state
sovereignty.
second,
i
will
argue
to
the
law
here
involved
is
simply
not
of
the
type
which
is
most
threatening
to
state
sovereignty
and
by
nature,
much
less
intrusive
than
other
concededly
valid
exercises
of
the
commerce
power.
and
third,
i
will
argue
that
even
if
one
ignores
completely
federal
assistance
to
state
budgets,
the
financial
impact
of
the
1974
amendments
is
far
too
small
to
be
thought
threatening
to
state
sovereignty
in
anyway.
since
the
appellants
accused
congress
essentially
of
negligence
and
failing
to
make
estimates
and
make
a
credible
study
of
the
cost
impact
and
so
forth,
it's
important
to
realize
what
the
congress
did
and
the
responsibility
of
the
process.
this
is
not
a
case
of
an
unconsidered
statute
reeking
unpredicted
havoc.
it's
not
that
at
all.
i
will
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
senators
williams
and
javits,
and
particularly
at
pages
5
to
13,
the
senators
described
the
process
which
congress
went
through
here.
they
had
before
them
a
detailed
study
of
the
cost
impact
of
the
1966
amendments
so
that
they
could
be
guided
by
experience.
they
had
before
them
a
detail
study
of
the
feasibility
of
extending
the
acts
coverage's
was
done
in
the
1974
amendments.
they
had
calculations
of
cost
and
they
held
lengthy
hearings.
the
national
league
of
cities
and
appellant
here
expressed
in
those
hearings
concern
about
the
overtime
requirements
as
applied
to
firemen.
in
response,
the
senate
house
conference
wrote
section
7
(k)
which
i
will
discuss
later
and
which
permits
a
departure
from
the
acts
other
overtime
requirements
precisely
to
meet
the
kind
of
problem
with
the
national
league
of
cities
and
the
california
are
talking
about.
so
that
--
and
congress
also
exempted
from
coverage
i
might
say,
not
only
executive,
administrative,
and
professional
personnel,
but
also
persons
who
hold
public
elective
office,
members
of
their
personal
stuff,
persons
who
serve
with
a
policy
making
level
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
assume
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
question
--
they
probably
could
include
for
example
administrative
or
supervisory
personnel.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
today
to
decide
this
case.
i
would
assume
they
could.
i
think
the
question
is,
is
the
state
seriously
hurt?
is
the
state
no
longer
a
viable
policy
making,
policy
implementing
center
because
of
what
congress
has
done
rather
than
a
question
of
the
category
of
person
covered.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
meant
mr.
justice
stewart
to
answer
that
by
saying
that
it
could
obviously
in
terms
of
the
commerce
power
per
se.
and
when
i
said
that
the
question
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
had
meant
to
say
when
i
said
that
i
didn't
think
it
depends
upon
the
category
of
person
but
depended
upon
whether
the
states
were
in
some
sense
destroyed
as
sovereign
entities.
that
was
a
case
where
you're
running
into
the
counter
bailing
interest
of
federalism
which
i
fully
concede
or
affirm
is
a
counter
bailing
constitutional
principle
which
must
be
taken
account
of.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
entirely
true
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
congress
pass
the
statute
tomorrow
which
said
that
every
state
employee
should
be
paid
$50.00
an
hour
and
it
is
all
became
impossible
for
state
governments
to
operate.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
not
only
seriously
in
question
but
i
would
expect
it,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
a
destruction
of
federalism.
and
that's
why
i
say
these
things
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
might.
it
seems
to
me,
the
republican
form
of
government
clause
has
a
lot
more
in
it
than
we
have
conventionally
taken
out
of
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
didn't
mentioned
that
one
solely
because
at
least
went
into
the
argument
about
whether
a
republican
form
of
government
is
a
political
question
and
whether
is
justiciable
and
so
forth,
but
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
i
think
whether
or
not
it's
justiciable
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
obligation
united
states
to
guarantee
every
state
or
republican
form
of
government.
but
also
runs
back
into
the
principle
of
federalism
and
i
have
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
correct.
well,
the
principle
of
federalism
as
the
appellants
quite
already
point
out
is
build
into
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
nothing
is
more
basic
and
my
argument
here
has
in
no
way
suggests
that
it
is
not
basic,
it
must
not
be
protected.
it
is
simply
is
that
this
statute
does
not
threaten
that
principle.
so
that
my
point
is,
the
congress
was
concerned
with
the
preservation
of
state
and
local
autonomy
in
terms
of
general
financial
impacts,
in
terms
of
particular
local
problems
which
they
adjusted
the
statute
to
take
care
of,
and
in
terms
of
exempting
anyone
in
any
degree
of
proximity
to
policy
making
and
they
try
to
preserve
the
value
of
federalism.
and
my
remaining
two
points
are
that
they
completely
succeeded.
the
first
one
is
that
these
amendments
are
by
their
nature,
less
of
a
threat
to
state
sovereignty,
then,
most
concededly
valid
exercises
of
the
commerce
power.
this
is
a
conceptual
argument
and
i
will
come
to
the
financial
impact
to
a
moment
which
is
a
factual
argument.
these
amendments
do
not
tell
a
state
other
than
paying
standard
wages
instead
of
substandard
wages,
do
not
tell
a
state
that
it
must
follow
any
policy
objective,
does
not
forbid
them
to
follow
any
policy
objective.
the
law
merely
says
that
whatever
policy
you
choose,
you
will
not
carry
it
out
by
paying
the
workers
who
carry
it
out,
substandard
wages
and
putting
them
under
substandard
working
conditions
which
i
think
is
a
quite
modest
to
constraint.
now,
that
constraint
conceptually
is
a
much
smaller
interference
with
state
sovereignty
than
a
federal
substantive
statute
which
tells
a
state
that
from
now
on,
you
may
not
have
a
state
law
on
this
subject;
it
must
be
the
federal
law.
now,
that
is
an
intrusion
upon
state
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
--
i
would
urge
upon
you
that
they
are
identical
in
that
sense
and
let
me
put
it
in
two
ways.
one
is
between
two
individuals,
if
individual
a
is
doing
50
things
which
he
enjoys
most
to
do
and
individual
b
has
some
power
over
him
and
says,
you
will
not
do
item
three
anymore.
from
now
on,
you'll
do
what
i
want.
so
it
is
left
with
49
that
he
wants
to
do.
or
individual
b
says,
i
don't
care
which
one
you
will
give
up
but
you
have
to
give
up
anyone
you
choose.
i
take
that
the
first
is
a
far
more
coercive
intrusive
interference
with
a
individual's
autonomy
and
hence
by
analogy
with
the
state's
sovereignty
than
the
second.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
doubt
that
that
would
be
--
i
know
that
the
court
said
that
in
those
cases
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
think
they
are
quite
distinguishable
cases
in
this
sense.
perhaps
i
can
illustrate
it
by
going
to
maryland
against
wirtz,
the
dissent
there,
was
afraid
that
if
the
power
to
set
a
floor
under
wages
is
at
a
ceiling
over
ours
was
conceded.
the
same
principle
might
be
extrapolated
to
the
point
where
the
congress
could
draw
up
to
the
states
budge
which
would
be
a
destruction
of
federalism.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
same
thing
might
have
been
said
about
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
was
upheld
in
jones
against
laughlin
and
deals
with
much
the
same
subject
matter
is
this.
people
come
in
and
say,
you
are
ousting
a
state
policy
in
the
area
of
labor
management
relations
completely.
whatever
the
state
wants
in
this
area
doesn't
matter
anymore.
the
federal
government
will
tell
them
what
the
law
is.
now,
the
objection
could
have
been
made
if
we
want
to
admit
the
principle
that
the
federal
government
can
do
that,
then
it
follows
that
the
federal
government
can
draw
up
the
entire
legal
code
of
the
states
and
i
suggest
to
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
the
federal
government
acting
into
the
supremacy
clause,
suddenly
decided
to
draw
up
the
entire
legal
codes
of
all
the
states
for
them
that
this
court
would
say,
that
goes
too
far,
you
have
destroyed
federalism.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
know
it
has
and
i
think
the
question
is
always
one
of
the
aggregate
impact,
the
question
is
always
one
of
degree.
i
cannot
believe
that
this
court
is
really
willing
to
concede
that
using
the
commerce
clause,
congress
can
write
every
law
of
state
has
and
it
can
virtually
do
that
under
modern
interpretations
of
what
affects
commerce.
at
some
point,
you
can
turn
a
state
into
nothing
more
than
a
geographical
area.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't
see
why
not
if
a
private
individual
happen
to
be
hurt
and
a
major
constitutional
value
was
in
play,
of
course,
perhaps
the
state
would
come
in.
but
i
take
it
that
if
a
state
came
in
and
brought
an
action
to
have
the
national
labor
relations
act
declared
unconstitutional
rather
than
a
private
individual
because
it
interfere
of
a
state
sovereignty.
i
take
it
and
it
made
the
same
argument
that
i
just
made
that
this
principle
would
allow
the
federal
government
to
draw
up
the
entire
state
code.
i
take
it
that
this
court
would
have
upheld
the
act
just
as
much
as
it
did
when
a
private
individual
brought
the
lawsuit.
but
that
is
indeed
my
point
that
a
law
which
does
not
oust
a
state
policy
but
merely
says,
choose
your
own
policy,
there
is
going
to
be
a
slight
additional
cost
in
standard
working
conditions
is
a
less
coercive,
less
intrusive,
less
threatening
to
state
sovereignty
form
of
law.
and
if
you
uphold
the
federal
statutes
which
actually
oust
state
policy
from
the
whole
areas,
then
this
law
i
should
think
is
not
the
law
to
start
being
concerned
about
federalism.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
assume
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
the
kind
of
thing
is
greater.
i
would
trust
that
when
a
private
individual
comes
in
and
says
that
state
sovereignty
is
being
destroyed
that
the
court
would
not
say,
well,
the
state
seem
to
be
relaxing
and
enjoying
it
so
we
will
uphold
the
statute
on
that
ground.
i
would
trust
the
real
consideration
is
what
is
happening
to
the
system
of
federalism
and
not
are
the
states
willing
to
consent.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true,
that
is
true,
but
i
take
it
it's
the
same
value
as
in
play
and
i
take
it
to
the
court
purports
in
those
cases
to
address
often
the
question
of
interstate
or
intrastate
which
is
a
way
of
protecting
federalism
so
that
they
do
pay
attention
to
the
principle.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
may
be
mr.
justice
rehnquist
for
the
full
approval
of
the
states.
i
think
the
labor
management
relations
was
not
a
“no
man's
land”.
there
were
state
laws,
there
were
state
courts.
congress
was
not
happy
with
what
the
state
courts
and
the
state
laws
were
doing
to
labor
management
relations
and
ousted
the
states
from
that
field.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
might
not
have
been
comprehensive
mr.
chief
justice
but
they
certainly
had
a
common
law
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
they
have
common
law
of
labor
relations
and
there
is
a
call
up
one
of
congress's
complaints
was
that
it
was
too
easy
to
get
injunctions
out
of
state
courts.
there
was
a
developing
law
of
labor
management
relations.
it
wasn't
a
very
happy
law
of
labor
management
relations
which
i
think
was
the
reason
congress
entered
the
field.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right.
if
the
state
chooses
to
have
no
law
and
let
the
thing
be
fought
out
by
the
adversaries,
still,
the
entry
of
the
federal
government
is
an
intrusion
upon
a
state
policy
choice.
i
think
--
i
do
not
quarrel
with
those
cases.
i
think
upholding
those
statutes
was
a
correct
decision.
all
i
say
is
that
this
statute
is
less
of
an
intrusion
upon
sovereignty
than
those
statutes.
and
therefore,
one
is
to
draw
the
line,
one
would
not
draw
with
this
statute
as
made
myself
a
point
about
it.
and
i
should
say
that
its
hardly
even
theoretically
possible
that
one
could
use
a
wage
in
hours
law
in
a
way
that
would
destroy
state
sovereignty
because
they
are
tied
to
necessarily
--
as
long
as
they
are
similar
to
the
wages
and
hours
required
of
private
employers
and
indeed
of
the
federal
government
as
an
employer
of
the
impact
upon
the
state
and
local
government
cannot
be
so
severe
that
state
sovereignty
is
destroyed.
well,
this
theoretical
distinctions
or
considerations
seem
to
me
in
and
of
themselves,
sufficient
to
rebut
appellant's
predictions
of
impending
doom.
but
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
point
out
that
the
appellants
have
also
rather
thoroughly
misunderstood
the
statute
and
its
impact
upon
them
so
that
the
extravagant
figures,
claims
as
takeover
and
so
forth
are
not
really
accurate.
now,
the
charges
made
us
so
plentiful
and
reflect
such
a
rich
and
very
misunderstanding
of
what's
involved
here
that
i
can
only
touch
upon
the
major
items.
first,
the
charge
is
that
the
1974
amendments
would
cost
some
unspecified
number
of
billions
of
dollars.
there
are
dozens
appear
to
be
any
foundation
for
that
at
all.
the
1966
amendments
had
no
impact
even
beginning
to
do
that
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
that
supports
any
speculation,
we
have
had
a
breakdown
of
the
items.
now,
the
impact
as
i
said
is
on
409,000
workers.
95,000
new
workers
covered
by
the
statute
and
314,000
workers
covered
by
the
66
amendments
now
have
the
minimum
wage
raised
to
$2.00
from
a
$1.80.
but
for
the
appellant's
theory
of
this
case
would
of
course
strike
down
the
1966
amendments
also
so
that
i
assume
about
409,000
workers
would
be
vulnerable
with
substandard
wages.
but,
their
principal
concern
appears
to
be
the
overtime
requirements
to
the
act
and
that
concern
i
must
say
is
greatly
exaggerated.
the
premium
for
work
over
40
hours
per
week
can
be
avoided
by
using
additional
employees
on
a
straight
time
basis.
that
will
spread
employment
and
that
is
what
the
congress
intended.
when
they
complain
about
that,
i
can
only
say
that
of
course
this
statute
requires
states
to
do
some
things,
not
very
many,
differently
than
they
might
otherwise
do
them;
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
but
the
only
specific
national
figure
they
give
for
the
overtime
cost
is
an
estimate
of
$200
million
for
fire
protection
services.
and
we
agree
that
most
of
the
cost
of
this
statute
will
be
indeed
overtime
cost.
but
this
$200
million
that
is
mentioned
is
a
vastly
inflated
figure.
it
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
local
governments
will
not
take
advantage
of
the
exemption
of
section
7
(k)
which
i
mentioned
earlier
which
was
put
in
the
senate
house
conference
on
this
bill,
specifically
because
of
the
concern
to
express
about
fireman
and
overtime,
and
that
section
7
(k)
provides
that
no
overtime
pay
is
due
unless
the
employee
works
on
average
of
over
60
hours
per
week
in
any
28-day
period.
now
only
about
10%
of
the
firefighting
personnel
in
this
nation
work
in
excess
of
60
hours
per
week
and
even
the
appellant
as
to
that
10%
apparently
calculates
only
about
$30
million
in
additional
cost
across
the
nation
for
them.
now
california
argues
in
its
brief
that
these
firefighters
--
their
firefighters
work
an
84-hour
week
during
the
fire
season,
and
that
this
act
would
have
drastic
results
with
respect
to
them.
i
can
see
no
impact
of
this
statute
upon
the
california
system
as
it
was
described
this
morning.
the
84-hour
week
they
described
it
in
the
california
brief
works
as
follows.
the
firefighters
worked
four
24-hour
days
on
followed
by
three
24-hour
days
off,
followed
by
thee
24-hour
days
on
and
four
24-hour
days
off.
california
assumes,
since
there
is
an
84-hour
week
in
there
that
it
will
have
to
pay
24-hours
of
overtime
every
week.
but
that
is
not
the
case.
under
the
statute,
since
these
firefighters
are
in
duty
for
over
24-hours
continuously,
sleep
and
meal
times
can
be
deducted,
so
if
you
take
four,
if
you
deduct
sleep
and
meal
times
from
this,
they
will
not
exceed
60
hours
a
week
and
overtime
will
not
be
due.
now
in
this
connection,
california
complained
readability
about
the
compensatory
time
these
firefighters
work
very
hard
during
the
fire
season
and
take
time
off
in
the
non-fire
season.
but
compensatory
time
does
not
arise
as
a
problem
under
these
amendments
unless
you
work
the
fireman
more
than
60
hours
a
week.
if
they
don't
work
the
fireman
more
than
60
hours
a
week,
they
can
give
them
compensatory
time
or
anything
else
they
want
in
anyway
they
choose
without
interference
from
this
statute.
so
that
the
entire
system
described
this
morning
seems
to
me
to
fit
well
within
the
statute
and
not
to
impose
the
kind
of
additional
cost
or
problems
that
california
is
talking
about.
now,
the
vexed
matter
of
records
and
reports
which
seems
to
be
confused
almost
beyond
recognition,
the
question
of
reports
which
are
discussed
in
the
brief
is
simple,
the
act
doe
not
require
the
preparation
or
the
filing
of
any
report.
the
question
of
records
is
about
as
simple
and
let
me
say
this,
when
the
appellant
say
that
this
act
reached
every
employee
of
every
local
and
state
government,
it
does
so
only
in
the
sense
that,
even
exempt
employees
must
have
a
record
kept,
but
if
we
look
at
the
nature
of
the
records,
there
are
records
which
are
not
required
by
the
federal
government
to
be
kept
in
any
particular
form
and
the
only
information
they
require
is
information
that
any
employer
would
obviously
have
about
his
workers.
it's
the
most
elementary
kind
of
thing.
you
have
to
have
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
they
are.
what
one
must
keep
is
the
employee's
name,
the
date
of
his
birth,
his
address,
his
social
security
number,
and
except
for
exempt
employees,
the
daily
hours
he
worked
and
the
total
wages
he
earned.
now
that
as
a
record
keeping
requirement
seems
to
me
well
within
what
any
employer
must
keep
as
a
matter
of
course.
now
the
appellants
have
tried
to
confuse
this
issue
by
quoting
at
length
from
robert
hampton
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
civil
service
commission
who
was
complaining
about
the
application
of
this
statute
to
the
federal
system
and
the
federal
system
as
at
page
9
and
my
brother
rhyne
read
from
page
9
this
morning,
i
would
point
out
the
robert
hampton
had
a
special
problem.
congress
want
to
pass
this
statute
said
you
must
give
the
federal
worker
whichever
is
better,
title
v
or
the
fair
labor
standards
act
so
that
they
do
have
to
keep
records
under
title
v
which
different
and
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
they
double
computations
and
figure
out
in
each
case
which
gives
the
employee
the
better
result.
no
such
requirement
is
imposed
upon
the
state.
so
that
mr.
hampton's
complaints
are
not
relevant
to
the
state.
now
the
act
does
preserve
the
state
may
keep
more
beneficial
statute
than
this
if
it
wished
but
they
are
not
mandated
as
they
are
for
the
federal
government,
and
therefore
mr.
hampton's
remarks
are
quite
beside
the
point.
now
as
to
volunteers,
the
act
as
it
has
been
interpreted
and
as
it
is
enforced
does
not
prevent
the
hiring
--
the
use
of
volunteer
in
any
part
of
state
government
and
indeed
reimbursement
for
reasonable
expenses
is
allowed
as
a
guideline
for
example
for
volunteer
fire
departments.
$2.50
per
call
will
not
even
be
questioned
above
$2.50
per
call.
they
may
look
at
it
to
see
whether
the
amount
of
reimbursement.
there
is
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
cost
incurred
by
the
volunteer
firefighter,
but
he
may
be
a
volunteer
above
that
price.
and
by
the
way,
the
labor
departments
mad
a
study,
the
average
volunteer
fire
department
call
is
20
minutes.
now,
there
was
reference
to
collective
bargaining.
this
statute
does
nothing
the
collective
bargaining.
employee
unions
are
free
to
bargain
collectively
for
anything
above
these
standards
they
wish.
the
civil
service
processes
states
civil
service
protection
remains
in
four
states
civil
service
processes
to
protect
their
worker
remain
enforced.
they
are
not
ousted.
now,
we
have
answered
a
variety
of
other
charges
in
our
brief
which
i
showed
when
i
go
though
here
and
the
various
amicus
briefs
answer
charges.
but
i
think
what
it
boils
down
to
is
the
appellant's
case
rest
upon
misunderstanding
of
the
statute,
and
alarmist
rhetoric
is
not
a
constitutional
crisis
here.
there
is
not
even
a
stiff
reason
at
teapot.
it's
astounding
to
hear
it
argued
i
think
in
this
stage
of
our
constitutional
history
that
federalism
and
state
sovereignty
depend
upon
the
ability
to
give
employees
substandard
wages
and
hours
to
give
them
less
and
the
federal
government
gives
them,
to
give
them
less
than
private
industry
gives
them,
indeed
often
less
than
enough
to
keep
them
off
the
welfare
rules,
that
cannot
be
the
test
of
state
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
only
power
they
have
lost
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
to
determine
to
pay
substandard
wages.
they
have
not
lost
the
power
to
pay
more
than
that.
they
have
not
lost
the
power
to
adjust
in
a
variety
of
ways.
and
i
think
the
power
to
--
as
i
have
suggested
perhaps
too
many
times,
the
power
to
pay
substandard
wages
must
be
less
important
to
state
sovereignty
than
the
power
to
enforce
your
own
social
policy
within
your
boarders.
the
commerce
clause
allows
the
federal
government
to
override
the
ladder.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
power
to
pay
substandard
wages
is
the
place
where
we
suddenly
trench
upon
the
value
of
federalism.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
is
not
much
bureaucratic
red
tape
and
furthermore
substandard
obviously
refers
to
a
national
standard
set
for
private
industry
and
for
the
federal
government.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
necessarily
involves
some
technical
rules
and
regulations.
i
might
say
that
when
a
locality
has
a
good
case
that
to
have
to
do
something
and
someway,
as
in
the
firefighter's
case,
congress
is
proved
responsive
and
made
an
adjustment.
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
this
statute
will
not
require
some
public
employers
to
change
some
ways
of
doing
business
or
of
governing
if
you
want
it
to
put
it
that
way
but
it's
affecting
interstate
commerce,
but
that's
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
it
may
spread
jobs
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
guess
i
do
two
things.
i
guess
i
say
in
the
first
place
that
the
state
and
local
government
workforce
is
expanding
quite
rapidly
and
is
continuing
to
grow.
it
is
now
i
think
about
14%
of
our
national
workforce
and
is
going
up.
and
to
say
that
that
is
an
exempt
from
all
of
the
protections,
we
extend
to
federal
workers
and
to
all
private
industry
workers
is
to
make
a
rather
large
statement
that
unless
there
were
compelling
constitutional
reasons,
i
don't
think
we
ought
to.
i
think
they
are
not
compelling
constitutional
reasons
because
it
escapes
me,
why
state
sovereignty
is
threatened
by
being
required
to
pay
a
dime
or
two
more
an
hour
is
threatened
by
being
required
to
pay
time
and
a
half
over
40
or
over
60
hours
or
to
hire
additional
workers
is
a
massive
intrusion
upon
states'
political
and
governmental
autonomy.
we
have
done
all
kinds
of
substantive
laws
to
tell
the
states
you
may
not
have
laws
on
this
subject.
this
seems
to
be
a
much
less
intrusive.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
i
would
have
exactly
the
same
arguments
available
to
me,
i
would
think,
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
difference
of
constitutional
dimension
that
that
would
be
a
larger
intrusion
than
this
one.
this
if
you
look
at
what
is
actually
done,
the
degree
of
impact
is
really
not
that
large.
it's
been
vastly
overstated
here.
every
extension
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
has
been
met
with
these
cries
or
takeover
and
destruction.
it's
something
that
hasn't
happen.
well,
i
have
addressed
myself
to
the
concerns
of
the
maryland
dissent
which
i
think
are
the
real
concerns
in
this
case
and
i've
shown
i
submit,
i
hope
i
have
shown
that
this
measure
does
not
involve
or
imply
the
federal
intrusion
upon
states
sovereignty
that
that
dissent
feared.
and
for
that
reason
and
because
we
permit
easily
other
kinds
of
federal
ousting
of
state
policy
which
are
far
more
intrusive,
i
suggest
it
would
be
illogical
and
arbitrary
to
draw
the
line
at
the
commerce
power
here
in
this
case.
and
i
therefore
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
going
to
discuss
a
case
which
initially
at
least
will
not
seem
to
have
very
much
resemblance
to
the
case
mr.
rhyne
just
discussed,
because
my
version
of
what
that
act
does
is
considerably
different
than
appellants.
the
central
issue
here
of
course
is
the
effect
of
the
74
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
upon
federalism.
mr.
rhyne
has
described
a
massive
and
disastrous
impact
upon
cities
and
states.
i
think,
i
can
state
and
show
that
it
will
be
very
little
impact,
certainly,
no
impact
that
threatens
the
value
of
federalism.
the
issue
between
this
can
be
stated
as
whether
or
not,
and
i
think
it
can
be
stated
the
popularity
of
maryland
against
wirtz
with
the
appellants
varies
from
time
to
time,
but
i
think
the
issue
is
still
whether
or
not
maryland
against
wirtz
should
be
overruled
and
the
dissent
there
become
a
new
law.
and
i
would
suggest
in
the
course
of
my
argument
that
such
a
decision
overturning
maryland
against
wirtz,
would
do
much
more
than
that.
it
would
undercut
the
rationale
of
almost
all
of
the
major
commerce
clause
decisions
of
this
court,
including
decisions
in
the
field
of
the
agricultural
statutes,
labor
law,
civil
rights
law
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
might
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
am
going
to
suggest
that
there
are
no
adequate
grounds
for
overruling
except
the
rationale
that
would
indeed
have
that
kind
of
a
constitutional
counterrevolution.
the
governments
position
rest
upon
three
prepositions.
but
first,
let
us
put
aside
the
question
of
federalism
for
a
moment
and
just
deal
with
the
jurisdiction
or
the
power
of
the
coverage
of
the
commerce
clause.
and
i
think,
as
to
the
coverage
of
the
commerce
clause,
as
to
its
application
here,
i
would
think
that
that
much,
not
the
federalism
issue,
but
that
much
would
have
been
settled
certainly
decisively
by
fry
against
the
united
states
and
certainly
a
lot
of
cases
before
that.
now
my
brother
rhyne
would
suggest
that
no
consideration
was
given
to
this
indeed,
congress
debated,
both
the
center
of
the
house
debated
and
reports
concluded
discussions
of
the
facts
of
interstate
commerce
involved
here
and
the
theories
by
which
commerce
clause
applied.
i
do
not
want
to
spend
much
time
on
this,
but
i
feel
i
must
spend
some
time
on
it
because
it
has
been
attacked
so
strongly
today.
there
is
no
doubt
that
interstate
commerce
is
in
play.
when
we
have
state
and
local
governments
which
in
1971
purchased
135
billion
dollars
worth
of
goods
and
services
and
that
was
12%
of
our
gross
national
product.
nor,
i
think,
there
can
be
no
any
doubt
of
the
significance
of
this
statute
to
that
commerce,
where
it
is
realized
that
this
amendment
extends
the
statute
to
3.4
million
employees,
not
just
minimum
wage,
it
also
has
overtime
provisions,
it
also
has
age
discriminations
provisions
and
so
forth.
and
that
makes
with
the
1966
amendment
upheld
in
maryland
against
wirtz,
a
total
of
6.3
million
employees
were
covered
by
the
statute.
now,
there
are
variety
of
reasons
why
extending
wages
and
hour
law
to
these
employees
as
rationally
related
to
commerce.
congress
made
the
findings
in
our
main
brief
in
at
pages
23
and
24.
we
discussed
--
the
senate
report
discussion
of
this
is
set
out.
of
course
it
is
not
up
to
the
government
here
to
prove
again
the
factual
findings
that
congress
made
in
the
standard
of
review
for
congress’
factual
finding
of
that
nature
of
course
is
set
forth
in
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
and
katzenbach
against
mcclung.
and
i
think,
they
easily
withstand
that
kind
of
review.
the
theories
upon
which
congress
attacks
this
well
were,
first,
that
substandard
working
conditions
are
likely
to
lead
to
labor
disputes,
and
hence,
the
strikes,
that
interrupt
the
flow
of
goods
and
services
in
the
state
commerce.
that
was,
in
the
original
finding
of
the
act,
the
original
findings
of
the
1938
act,
the
theory
was
adopted
to
support
the
1966
amendments
in
maryland
against
wirtz
was
advanced
in
debate
here
for
the
1974
amendments.
and
this
labor
strike
theory
of
course
was
accepted
by
this
court
as
long
ago
as
labor
board
against
jones
and
laughlin,
upholding
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
it
should
be
said
that
maryland
against
wirtz
covered
mostly
custodial
workers,
orderlies
and
nurses
aides,
and
it
is
hard
to
think
that
any
of
the
employees
covered
by
the
1974
amendments
have
a
more
tenuous
nexus
to
interstate
commerce
than
those
employees.
we
have
dealt
with
in
maryland
against
wirtz.
second,
i
mentioned
the
competition
between
governments
tends
to
or
can
spread
substandard
working
conditions
as
governmental
units
compete
with
lower
taxes
and
lower
wage
rates
to
make
up
for
that.
i
know
for
again
that
is
a
rational
relationship,
congress
can
act
on
that
ground.
i
am
not
obliged
to
upheld
the
trial
and
prove
that
congress’
factual
finding
were
correct.
thirdly,
the
increase
of
purchasing
power
through
higher
wages
and
the
spread
or
work
tends
to
stimulate
interstate
commerce.
now,
that
is
the
theory
of
course,
very
much
like
the
theory
in
which
the
1964
civil
rights
act
was
upheld
in
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
where
it
was
pointed
out
that
refusal
of
certain
restaurants
to
serve
blacks
on
all
these
food
purchases
which
adversely
effects
in
the
state
commerce.
so
that
too
has
established
constitutional
mode
applying
the
commerce
clause.
and
finally,
it
is
quite
clear,
as
the
senate
report
states,
that
raising
the
minimum
wage
rate
at
a
level
which
will
at
least
help
to
assure
the
worker
an
income
at
or
above
the
poverty
level
is
essential
to
the
reduction
of
the
welfare
rules
and
the
overall
reform
of
the
welfares
on
the
united
states
and
certainly
taking
all
people
off
welfare
rules
and
giving
them
productive
jobs
is
a
means
of
affecting
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
a
fireman
and
police
may
not
be
in
the
welfare
rules
but
there
are
people
on
the
welfare
rules,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
kind
of
wage
they
can
get
in
certain
kinds
of
jobs
is
so
low,
they
are
well
below
the
poverty
level.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
are
people,
i
suppose
who
will
not
take
jobs
at
a
very
substandard
wage,
who
would
take
it
if
a
job
if
price
was
raised.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
maybe
such
people,
there
maybe
people
who
find
that
they
can
support
themselves
on
these
wages.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
some
cases,
yes,
i
think.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
let
me
try
this
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
overtime
provisions,
of
course
as
congress
stated
it.
it
is
exclusively
stated
in
the
senate
report
i
refer
to
is
to
spread
work
to
get
some
employers
for
some
kinds
of
jobs,
not
to
pay
overtime,
but
instead
to
hire
additional
worker
at
straight
time.
now
that
would
take
people
off
the
welfare
rules.
that
of
course
was
one
of
the
theories
of
the
original
fair
labor
standards
act
upheld
in
the
darby
case,
and
it
is
the
theory
that
is
carried
over
to
these
1974
amendments.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
to
be
persuaded
that
this
act
was
wise
social
policy
or
was
unwise
social
policy.
i
merely,
as
you
say
mr.
chief
justice,
raising
that
as
showing
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
in
this
area
before
coming
to
the
federalism
point,
i
would
really
come
to
that,
i
am
just
talking
about
the
straightforward
application
of
the
commerce
clause
as
it
would
be
applied
in
any
case,
except
for
the
claim
that
you
cannot
do
it
when
a
state
or
local
government
is
involved.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
it
is,
the
spreading,
yes
it
is
affirmatively
recited
in
our
brief
at
page
24,
the
main
brief.
the
senate
report
talks
about
raising
the
minimum
wage
level
to
assure
the
workers
an
income
above
the
poverty
level
and
to
reduce
the
welfare
rules.
and
of
course,
the
purpose
of
spreading
work
by
encouraging
the
hiring
of
additional
at
straight
time
is
in
the
legislative
history
extensively.
but
i
would
have
thought
that
on
the
pure
question
of
whether
of
this
was
rationally
related
to
the
interstate
commerce,
if
there
was
no
question
but
for
mr.
rhyne’s
statements
today.
coming
to
the
other
issue,
which
i
think
is
the
crucial
issue,
as
to
whether
statute
impinges
upon
the
value
of
federalism,
i
take
it
we
know
that
the
outset
of
course
that
there
is
no
immunity
of
state
or
local
government
from
federal
regulation
as
cases
like
the
sanitary
district
case
and
the
california
case
test,
but
i
want
to
make
two
arguments,
one
conceptual
about
the
nature
of
the
statute
and
one
factual
about
the
actual
impact
of
the
statute.
the
conceptual
argument
is
this,
the
1974
amendments,
seem
to
me
by
their
nature,
less
intrusive,
less
coercive,
less
damaging
to
state
sovereignty,
local
sovereignty,
and
so
less
threatening
the
to
the
value
of
federalism
than
most
of
the
statutes
which
this
court
has
upheld,
under
the
commerce
clause
in
the
past.
and
it
has
done
regularly
for
decades.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
am
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
do
not
think
i
do
mr.
justice
rehnquist
unless
the
commerce
power
or
any
other
power
was
used
in
a
way
that
struck
at
the
state’s
ability
to
be
a
policy-making
government
and
a
policy-implementing
center.
but
i
cannot,
through
the
light
of
me,
see
any
distinction
between
telling
a
state
that
your
social
policy
is
henceforth
superseded
and
void
and
a
federal
policy
which
we
impose
takes
the
field.
that
seems
to
be
much
more
intrusive
upon
federalism
and
upon
the
local
sovereignty
than
saying,
“you
must
pay
a
minimum
wage,”
which
we
pay
and
which
private
employers
pay.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
never
meant
to
put
the
concession
or
affirmation
as
i
recall
it
about
federalism
on
that
ground.
i
think
there
is
a
limit
to
how
much
state
law
the
congress
can
oust.
i
hope
there
will
be
limit,
because
i
think
it
would
be
meaningless
to
worry
about
federalism
if
it
turned
out
that
the
only
thing
that
states
could
do
was
tax
and
pay
employees
who
were
not
allowed
to
do
anything
because
the
federal
government
had
taken
over
all
the
policies.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
though
i
had
detected
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
in
the
dissent
in
words
and
in
the
dissent
in
fry,
the
beginning
of
the
concern
about
federalism
in
an
attempt
to
find
the
judicial
formulation
that
would
preserve
it
against
all
kinds
of
attacks
of
a
kind
i
have
not
seen
in
the
cases
as
to
1930’s
and
i
think
it
is
fine,
i
think
that
is
desirable
attempt
to
find
the
formulation
that
controls
federal
power
short
of
the
point
where
state
and
local
sovereignty
is
destroyed,
both
in
the
field
where
you
are
affecting
a
state’s
budget
and
in
the
field
where
you
are
ousting
the
state’s
laws,
i
do
not
see
any
distinction
between
those.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know
if
they
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
not
really
thought
about
that.
this
act
does
not
do
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
might
be
within
federal
power.
i
do
not
know
i
hesitate
to
try
to
guess
it
but
all
the
cases
because
i
am
going
to
suggest
that
this
case
is
quite
easily
solved,
much
more
easily
solved
than
any
of
the
other
kinds
of
statutes
such
as
the
one
you
mentioned.
and
i
was
trying
to
suggest,
why
this
is
a
much
less
intrusive
statute,
the
kind
of
statute
you
just
mentioned.
and
i
think
it
is
possible
of
course,
to
think
of
all
kinds
of
federal
incursions
in
the
state
power
that
one
would
say
federalism
is
effectively
gone.
but
my
point
here
is,
that
these
are
always
matters
of
degree
and
no
principle
is
being
put
forward
today
which
would
justify
the
overwhelming
of
the
states.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
i
understand
correctly
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
there
would
certainly
be
a
problem,
a
serious
problem,
about
applying
such
as
ceiling
permanently,
other
than
emergency
basis
on
this,
permanently
two
elected
officials
and
top
policy
makers
because
that
might
affect
the
quality
of
people
you
could
get
for
those
jobs.
a
ceiling,
generally,
on
the
kinds
of
workers
who
are
covered
here
that
is
essentially
ministerial
task,
i
think
that
is
the
other
side
of
this
case,
which
is
why
i
think
the
fry
rationale
basically
supports
us
here.
and
i
think
the
question
then
becomes
one
of
degree
of
impact.
it
is
quite
possible
to
imagine
a
world
in
which
state
and
local
governments
were
so
unable
to
maintain
themselves
that
even
a
statute
like
this
which
puts
a
lower
burden
upon
the
states
and
local
governments
than
the
federal
government
places
upon
itself
and
lower
burden
upon
them
that
are
placed
upon
the
private
employers.
it
is
possible
to
imagine
a
universe
in
which
still
that
would
be
too
much
for
the
state
and
local
government
to
shoulder.
but
that
is
not
that
factual
situation,
we
face
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
on
these
kinds
of
employees,
unless
the
ceilings
were
low
enough
so
that
it
could
be
shown
that
it
actually
hindered
the
states
and
their
localities
from
carrying
out
their
policies,
but
that
is
my
point.
this
is
always
a
matter
of
degree
and
one
can
not
find
except,
i
would
suggest
one
line
of
principle.
one
can
not
find
but
the
nature
of
this
kind
of
law,
a
bright
line
distinction
that
will
never
be
available.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
the
dissent
in
maryland
against
wirtz
thought
that
a
principle
had
been
adopted
by
which
the
federal
government,
if
it
wished,
that
overwhelmed
the
state
budget,
the
state
fiscal
policy
and
virtually
draw
up
the
state
budget.
now
i
think,
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is,
that
i
do
not
believe
such
a
principle
was
adopted
there.
if
such
a
principle
were
adopted
there,
i
would
suppose
that
the
case
was
wrongly
decided.
i
do
not
think
it
was.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
do
no
think
it
is.
i
confess
that
the
emotional
impact
of
my
brother
rhyne’s
brief
and
argument,
really
rests
upon
a
statement,
of
things
as
facts
which,
i
am
sorry
to
say
are
not
facts.
when
i
got
his
brief
last
week
and
read
it,
i
was
terrified,
i
thought
i
was
defending
a
monstrosity
of
a
statute,
because
it
turned
out
that
we
were
going
to
bankrupt
the
cities,
drive
the
polices
from
the
streets,
send
the
fire
fighters
in
california
home
just
as
the
forest
erupted
into
a
blaze,
destroy
the
volunteer
concept
with
a
specific
virtue,
and
this
thing
apparently
has
about
the
social
policy
attractiveness
of
a
nuclear
holocaust.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
think
that
necessarily
follows
at
all
from
this
case
mr.
justice
powell.
let
me
suggest,
this
case
presents
a
particular
type
of
statute
and
and
if
you
were
asking,
what
could
i
do
with
this
type
of
statute
to
protect
the
federalism.
i
think
the
answer
would
be
quite
simple.
this
case
lends
itself
to
an
easy
rule
and
that
is
a
no
discrimination
rule.
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court,
i
think,
to
hold
in
the
right
case,
that
the
federal
government
may
not
impose
cost
and
burdens
upon
the
states
and
local
governments
significantly
greater
than
it
bears
itself.
here,
the
cost
and
burdens
imposed
upon
the
terms
of
minimum
wage,
upon
the
state
and
local
governments
are
less
than
the
federal
government
imposes
upon
itself
because
the
federal
government
employees
are
subject
to
this
act
or
to
title
5
whichever
by
provision
is
more
favorable
to
the
employee.
so
that
i
think,
if
it
were
always
held,
that
there
could
be
no
discrimination
against
the
states
by
the
federal
government.
that
would
be
a
perfectly
adequate
protection
for
the
states.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no.
i
am
sorry.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
powell,
i
was
trying
to
say
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
pay
levels,
that
type
of
statute
in
which
obviously
federalism
could
be
destroyed
by
a
minimum
wage
which
said
$30
per
hour
for
state
employees
or
could
be
destroyed
be
a
statute
which
said,
“you
may
pay
no
state
employee
more
than
$4000
a
year.”
obviously
those
things
would
destroy
statutes.
but
if
you
use
a
no
discrimination
rule,
the
federal
government
without
destroying
itself
can
never
destroy
federalism.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
the
taxing
field
is
somewhat
different
than
this
field
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
it
would
be
--
i
think
it
is
different
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
but
i
fail
to
see
in
this
context
why
a
‘no
discrimination’
rule
would
not
be
a
complete
answer
to
a
fears
about
the
federalism.
when
you
get
to
a
case
like
this,
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
the
labor
law
and
the
other
cases,
obviously,
a
‘no
discrimination
rule’
is
not
going
to
work
as
well
to
protect
federalism.
but
here,
it
would
work
perfectly.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
for
this
reasons,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
if
the
federal
government
said,
we
will
subject
the
states
to
all
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
thereby
oust
the
states
completely
from
any
policy
enforcement
or
policy
making
function.
i
suppose
that
would
be
no
discrimination
but
there
would
also
be
no
state
sovereignty.
here,
if
you
say,
the
states
must
pay
a
minimum
wage
of
the
same
size
that
the
federal
government
pays,
in
fact
here
is
less
because
of
this
title
5
comparison
or
to
take
mr.
justice
powell’s
case,
the
limitation
upon
state
salaries
must
be
no
greater
than
the
limitation
upon
federal
salaries,
that
kind
of
a
test,
i
think,
would
adequately
protect
federalism
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
i
can.
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
this
fundamentally
with
different
types
of
statutes.
the
collective
bargaining
case
is
a
case
or
the
other
cases
we
have
been
talking
about
are
cases
in
which
you
subject
the
states
to
your
rule
of
policy,
what
the
law
should
be.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
that
is
really
--
the
budget
in
some
sense
follows
from
the
choice
about
the
various
policies
you
want
to
carry
out
and
the
various
programs
you
want
to
carry
out
rather
the
other
way
around.
and
it
seems
to
me,
for
the
reasons,
for
another
reasons,
that
this
kind
of
statute
is
less
intrusive.
suppose
a
state
has
five
hundred
policies
that
carries
out
through
its
programs.
the
approach
of
the
standard
commerce
clause
case
when
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
or
the
labor
relations
act
is
being
considered
is
to
come
along
and
say
to
the
state,
“two
of
your
polices
have
just
been
completely
wiped
out
and
our
policy
is
going
to
take
over.”
the
approach
of
this
statute
is
to
say,
“it
is
going
to
cost
you
somewhat
more,”
and
i
have
been
trying
to
get
to
the
point
that
it
is
not
going
to
cost
very
much
at
all.
“this
is
going
to
cost
you
somewhat
more
to
run
your
500
policies.”
you
may
raise
taxes,
and
run
them
all
as
you
wish.
you
may
cutback
some
of
them,
cutback
all
of
them
slightly
or
drop
two
completely,
the
choice
is
yours.
that
is
a
much
less
intrusive
kind
of
statute
than
the
statute
that
says,
“remember
that
law
you
just
passed,
it
no
longer
exists.
our
law
has
taken
over.”
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
you
are
required
to
give
up
the
policy
of
paying
a
worker
less
than
$2.20
per
hour.
i
cannot
believe
that
is
as
much
of
a
threat
to
federalism
as
policies
go
as
statement
that,
in
labor
relations,
your
policy
is
ousted
and
our
takes
over.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
that
is
my
point
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
that
this
case
is
like
those
cases
and
to
strike
down
this
case,
you
would
have
to
have
a
constitutional
counterrevolution
and
i
think
it
would
take
you
buy
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so,
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
all
fairness
to
the
law,
i
hesitate
to
think
of
the
number
of
cases,
i
think
you
ought
to
call
overruled
if
i
lose
this
case.
but
i
do
not
want
to
suggest
that
the
scorched
earth
all
around
the
federal
statutes
and—
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice.
part
of
my
answer,
i
think
the
major
part
of
my
answer
is,
the
‘no
discrimination’
rule
because
that
shows
nobody
is
attacking
federalism.
the
other
answer
which
i
made
partially
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
that
is
quite
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
there
is
no
constitutional
barrier
unless
after
the
statute
had
gone
into
effect,
and
this
one
has
not.
and
we
are
dealing
here
with,
that
grossest
kind
of
speculations
we
are
just
going
to
do.
after
the
statute
had
gone
in
to
effect
and
it
turned
out
that
even
though
there
was
no
discrimination
and
the
federal
government
was
bearing
those
cost
too,
that
there
were
states
and
localities
who
simply
could
not
function
as
effective
sovereigns
with
that
kind
of
wage
rate,
then
i
think
you
would
have
a
different
kind
of
lawsuit.
that
is
why
i
said
before,
i
could
imagine
a
universe,
i
do
not
think
we
are
in
it.
but
i
could
imagine
a
universe
in
which
even
though
there
was
no
discrimination
and
even
though
that
there
are
no
political
safeguards
to
federalism
that
do
exist.
after
all
these
appellants
have
enormous
amount
of
influence,
congress
and
many
of
these
changes
in
the
law.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is,
i
think
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart
because
they
managed
to
get
their
figures
by
overlooking
the
exemptions
in
the
statute
that
congress
put
in
at
their
request
which
i
must
say
is
a
way
of
getting
high
figures.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
i
have
a
great
deal
of
problem
with
that,
one
point
of—
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
one
of
the
things
that
i
was
saying
was,
that
i
will
have
more
trouble
as
any
regulation
got
applied
to
policy
making
officials
or
elected
officials.
i
am
talking
now,
i
mean
i
just
have
trouble
with
any
coverage
there
but
i
am
talking
now
about
coverage
of
essentially
laboring
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
fry?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
frankly,
i
am
sorry
to
say,
i
do
not
recall.
mr.
justice
stewart
says
it
did
not,
certainly
this
statute
was
very
carefully
drafted
to
leave
out
anybody
who
was
professional,
anybody
who
was
supervisory,
anybody
who
was
policy-making
or
elected.
and
i
might
say,
my
brother
rhyne
talked
about
the
local
judge
and
his
clerk,
neither
was
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
when
i
say
difficulty,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
mean
difficulty
not
that
i
was
clear
that
it
was
unconstitutional,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
then
affecting
the
quality,
or
the
people
or
the
type
of
people
the
state
may
attract
to
its
highest
officers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
there
is
anything
under
the
constitution,
it
is
that
value
of
federalism
we
are
discussing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
might
think
that,
but
i
think
that
a
large
part
of
my
reason
for
thinking
so
would
be
the
federalism
counterweight.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
can,
you
can
if
you
stick
to
the
commerce
clause
and
its
usual,
rational
relation
test
to
do
not
bring
in
to
bare
play
the
counterweight
of
federalism
which
i
am
explicitly
willing
to
do,
indeed,
i
think
should
be
done,
and
i
am
arguing
that
in
this
case,
when
that
counterweight
is
fully
considered
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
for
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
statute
we
are
facing
today,
it
is
a
totally
adequate
test
because
this
statute
vary
carefully
does
not
reach
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
while
the
circumstances
change
judge
stevens,
i
think
you
would
have
to.
for
example,
if
you
begin
to
see
federal
statutes
proliferating
in
every
fields
so
that
the
divorce
law
is
taking
over,
and
the
commercial
code
is
taking
over.
i
suppose,
some
place,
these
courts
would
have
to
frame
a
test
to
call
a
halt,
some
place.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
was
trying
to
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that,
this
case
by
its
nature,
lends
itself
to
control
more
easily
than
other
kinds
of
cases
and
by
its
nature,
its
judiciary
and
also
is
less
intrusive
upon
state
sovereignty
than
the
other
kinds
of
statutes
that
this
courts
has
held
well
within
the
commerce
clause.
so,
that
my
point
is,
i
quite
agree,
there
may
come
a
time
when
a
stopping
place
has
to
be
defined,
but
they
call
this
case,
the
occasion
for
drawing
that
line,
i
think
would
be
to
draw
a
line
at
any
illogical
place
for
the
wrong
reasons.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
when
we
were
discussing
judges,
i
did
not
intend
to
make
any
distinction
between
the
elected
and
appointed
judges.
since
we
are
dealing
with
high
policy
officials
at
that
point
and
i
would
have
grave
trouble
in
allowing
regulation
of
such
positions.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
in
1971.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
the
figures
on
that
mr.
chief
justice.
the
1974
amendments
covered
workers
whose
total
wage
bill
is
$36.6
billion.
now,
the
labor
department
has
worked
this
out
and
the
bureau
of
census
has
provided
statistics,
the
cost
of
the
minimum
wage
to
the
90,000
persons
we
think
are
paid
less
than
the
minimum
wage,
and
our
supplemental
brief
most
recent
one
discloses
how
that
figured
was
arrived
then.
the
cost
of
the
minimum
wage
would
be
to
add
$33
million
to
the
$36.6
billion
or
to
add
one-tenth
of
1%.
the
maximum
overtime
cost
would
be
to
add
$366
million
and
that
is
inflated
because
that
is
based
on
a
forty-hour
week
and
as
our
brief
explains
sixty-hour
week
without
overtime
is
allowed
and
all
kinds
of
exemptions
are
allowed.
but
basing
on
the
forty-hour
week
and
with
no
averaging,
it
comes
out
to
$366
million
which
is
one
percent
of
the
wage
bill
it
covers.
that
is
a
total
of
$400
million
altogether,
which
is
a
little
different
than
the
figure
of
well
over
a
billion
that
mr.
rhyne
derived
on
a
basis
which
we
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
these
are
the
labor
department's
figures.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
in
our
latest
brief,
that
is
in
type-script
reply
to
the
supplemental
brief.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
some
of
them
were
in
reports
to
congress
and
i
forget
precisely
where
that
one
was,
maybe
i
can
be
told
where
it
was.
i
do
not
know
if
that
was
in
a
report
to
congress
or
where
it
was.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
these
are
bureau
of
census
figures
and
bureau
of
labor
statistic
figures.
they
are
published.
they
may,
i
can
not
that
there
is
no
possibility
that
there
is
any
error
in
them,
but
it
possible
to
reconstruct
the
way
they
were
they
were
compiled
and
published
and
the
other
figures
we
have
are
based
upon
mr.
rhyne's
correspondence
with
various
local
officials
and
there
is
no
way
to
tell
how
those
were
complied.
but
congress’
estimate
was
that
this
bill
would
cost
less
than
2%
perhaps
over
1%
in
the
wage
cost.
i
am
going
to
say
that
these
figures
suggest,
that
the
total
cost
would
be
1.1%,
which
is
not,
i
think,
controlling
85%
of
the
state
or
city’s
budget.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
in
the
first
place
of
course
mr.
justice
powell.
the
federal
government
employees
do
operate
in
the
same
area,
so
that
they
are
imposing
upon
themselves
the
cost
for
that
area,
the
same
as
they
imposed
upon
this
state.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
i
think
in
this
area,
perhaps
it
should.
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
constitutional
requirement
that
it
should.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
justice
powell,
i
trust
i
have
not
suggested
homogenizing
the
country.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
of
course
every
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
is
a
step
towards
the
obliteration
of
federalism.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
my
entire,
that
entire
part
of
my
argument
mr.
justice
powell
was
devoted
to
saying
there
is
no
difference
between
this
case,
in
its
effect
upon
state’s
sovereignty
than
darby,
the
united
stated
against
darby,
where
they
told
the
state
of
georgia,
for
the
first
time
georgia
had
a
minimum
wage
which
it
did
not
want
and
that
ousting
state’s
sovereignty,
i
do
not
see
the
difference.
now
the
suggestion
is
that
the
difference
is
that
you
have
touched
the
state
in
some
metaphysical
way.
you
have
touched
the
states
body
in
a
way
that
you
don’t.
when
you
are
merely
take
the
laws
of
the
states
passes
away
from
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
that
has
certainly
been
true
ever
since
the
first
exercise
of
the
commerce
clause.
you
have
introduced
a
principle
which
becomes
a
matter
of
degree
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
my
point
about
that
is
that
i
think
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
statute
that
touches
the
state
in
this
way
and
a
statute
that
touches
the
state
by
saying
it
may
not
govern
its
citizens
in
the
way
that
it
has
chosen
to
do
so
in
that
past.
i
recognize
that
in
the
fry
dissent,
this
kind
of
point
was
being
made
--
that
cases
like
darby
and
jones
and
laughlin
are
not
really
relevant
because
those
were
private
citizens
who
were
making
a
claim
which
could
only
be
a
claim
that
congress
lacked
legislative
power.
now,
i
think
those
cases
are
relevant.
the
suggestion
there
is
that
the
state
has
a
different
inherent
objection
based
upon
federalism.
i
can
not
understand
how
that
it
come
about
for
one
thing,
the
tenth
amendment
reserves
the
right
to
the
states
and
the
people
and
makes
no
distinction
as
to
whether
it
is
a
person
or
a
state
that
is
raising
the
federalism
claim.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
why
do
i
have
any
doubt
about
it,
because
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
when
you
get
to
limiting,
controlling
what
the
states
does
with
respect
to
it
governor,
its
judges,
its
legislators,
its
policy-making
officials,
its
cabinet
officials,
your
are
effectively
limiting
them
in
the
way
can
get
people
and
deal
with
people
in
making
policy.
here,
the
federal
government
has
gone
nowhere
near
that
area.
it
is,
the
statute,
stayed
as
far
as
possible
away
from
anybody
to
be
called
a
supervisor
or
a
policy-maker,
i
would
be
troubled.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
seems
to
me
that
constitutional
principles
changed
with
circumstance
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
governor
of
the
states,
with
the
states
supreme
court,
you
are
dealing
with
the
state
at
its
most
intimate,
the
center
of
its
policy
making
apparatus.
there
he
is
striking
at
sovereignty,
when
you
are
saying
to
pay
that
man
that
shoveling
snow,
26
more
an
hour,
i
do
not
think
that
you
have
done
the
same
thing
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
be,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
do
not
think,
i
can
elaborate
all
of
the
distinctions,
i
would
want
to
make,
if
i
were
faced
with
that
kind
of
thing.
but
in
as
a
general
matter,
i
would
be
much
more
troubled
about
any
federal
regulation
of
what
you
can
do
with
respect
to
a
state
judges
in
paying
him
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
yes.
i
think
when
you
deal
with
the
policy-making
individual
or
body,
it
is
different.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
is
a
school
of
thought
centered
in
the
yale
law
school,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
suggest
that
they
do
occasionally,
but
i
was
trying
to
prevent
it
in
this
case
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
secretary
or
something.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
may
well
be.
obviously,
mr.
justice
powell
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
complete
and
unbroken
spectrum
from
somebody
who
is
emptying
waste
baskets
to
somebody
who
has
a
power
to
call
up
a
national
guard
and
so
forth
--
the
governor’s
(inaudible)
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
--the
trouble
with
this
whole
field
is
we
are
dealing
with
the
complete
spectrum
of
power
in
the
commerce
clause
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
specify
the
break
line,
right
where
the
power
breaks
or
right
where
the
distinction
breaks.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so,
i
think
so,
because
then
you
are
getting
close
to
the
essence
of
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think,
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
the
position
in
fry
dissent
seems
to
separate
out
the
commerce
clause
and
something
like
a
personal
privilege
that
a
state
can
assert.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
had
always
thought
that
the
tenth
amendment
merely
made
explicit
what
the
fact
of
enumeration
of
powers
may
employ.
and
that
federalism
lived
in
the
interstices
of
the
enumerated
powers.
but,
i
think
there
is
something
more
than
that
and
i
do
not
think
one
has
to
use
the
tenth
amendment
as
a
textual
peg.
what
there
is
more
than
that
is
a
document
that
contemplates
this
dual
system
of
government.
and
if
the
document
contemplates
that,
then
i
think
reasoning
not
from
any
particular
textual
passage
or
reasoning
from
the
structure,
the
constitution
in
the
pure
sense
of
the
word.
one
says,
“if
the
federal
government
undertakes
to
destroy
a
state
government,
the
judiciary
may
stop
it.”
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
usually
does
because
of
the
warrant
given
up
by
the
constitution,
so
there
is
that
counterweight
in
the
constitution.
i
have
no
problem
with
it.
i
think,
in
order
to
make
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
all
of
the
other
commerce
clause
cases,
i
really
think
one
has
to
adopt
the
fry
dissent
and
i
think
if
one
does
that,
one
has
all
kinds
of
difficulty.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
find
greatly
difficulty
there,
i
would
like
to
address
that
if
i
may
at
a
little
length.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
had
attempted
to
discuss
that
once
or
twice.
but
i
think
in
order
to
distinguish
darby
from
this
case,
which
is
the
real
question
before
us,
that
you
would
have
to
have
a
constitutional
innovation
of
really
some
dimensions,
because
one
has
to
say
that,
“to
touch
the
state
is
forbidden
and
a
state
can
raise
objections
that
an
individual
cannot
in
the
name
of
federalism,
which
is
of
course
what
the
fry
dissent
suggests.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
i
am
suggesting
it
was
operating
in
darby
mr.
justice
white.
the
case
came
out
as
it
did.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
the
federalism
objection
is
validly
raised
by
an
individual
or
an
enterprise
as
much
as
by
a
state.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
has
upon
occasion,
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
darby
and
wirtz
are
the
same
only,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
sense
that
federalism
could
be
considered
in
both
cases
in
each
case
even
though
in
one
case
it
was
raised
by
a
lumber
manufacturer
and
the
other
case
it
is
raised
by
a
state
but
it
depends
upon
what
is
you
are
applying
the
federal
regulation
to.
if
you
are
applying
it
to
a
set
of
individuals,
a
bank
president,
then
you
have
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
do
not
think,
the
distinction
between
whether
the
law
operates
upon
the
state
as
this
one
does
or
upon
the
state’s
citizens
makes
any
difference.
and
i
would
suppose
it
does
not
because
i
would
suppose
among
other
things
that
that
would
mean
that
the
states
could
waive
federalism,
that
if
only
individuals
came
in
here
to
this
court
and
said,
“congress
has
exceeded
its
power
and
is
taking
away
the
policy-making
functions
of
the
state
by
replacing
its
legal
code
that
this
court
would
have
to
say,
but
you
are
not
the
state
and
therefore
we
do
not
consider
federalism
even
though
federalism
is
destroyed.
i
do
not
believe
that.
i
do
not
believe
that
federalism
is
an
immunity
personal
to
the
state
which
the
state
may
wave
if
it
does
not
choose
to
raise
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
if
this
court
becomes
impressed
with
the
idea
that
in
fact,
the
states
are
being
ousted
as
law-making
and
law
enforcing
bodies
that
a
stopping
point
will
have
to
be
called.
i
can
not
imagine—
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
maybe
various
kinds
of
test
that
can
be
constructed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
do
not
think
it
does
very
much,
but
that
is
why
i
think
the
federalism
is
not
very
heavily
implicated
there.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we
probably
heard
quite
states
laws
about
the
subject.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
state
probably
does
have
laws
about
loan-sharking
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
only
i
think
in
the
sense
that
the
tenth
amendment
conforms
the
implication
to
be
drawn
from
two
other
things.
one
is
the
implication
to
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
powers
are
enumerated
and
therefore,
in
some
sense,
limited.
and
the
other
is
the
fact
that
the
document
that
constitution
specifies
dual
sets
of
governments
and
to
that
extent,
specifies
that
there
is
federalist
value
written
in
the
document,
just
as
they
would
have
been
i
think,
the
constitution
protection
for
free
political
speech
there
had
never
been
a
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
if
it
does,
one
could
say
that
the
federalist
value
is
located
in
the
tenth
amendment,
but
i
think
it
is
located
elsewhere
at
the
tenth
amendment
is
just
as
true
as
just
in
this
court
said
in
darby.
but
if
it
is
located
in
the
tenth
amendment,
then
it
is
certainly
not
true
that
this
case
is
different
from
darby
because
the
tenth
amendment
explicitly
says,
“the
rights
are
reserved
to
the
states
and
to
the
people
if
not
delegated
to
the
congress.”
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
would
suggest
if
we
are
talking
doctrinally,
conceptually,
i
would
suggest
that
the
federalism
ground
is
independent
weight
which
inheres
in
the
structure
of
government
that
the
constitution
establishes.
and
i
think
it
is
mistaken
to
try
to
attach
it
to
the
tenth
amendment
as
a
peg
or
to
the
commerce
clause
a
peg.
it
is
a
generalized
constitutional
value.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
a
professor
of
law,
i
would
prefer
that
approach
as
solicitor
general,
i
would
find
either
approach
that
reached
that
result,
extremely
painful.
and
furthermore,
i
think
that
it
will
prove
very
hard
to
explain
why
this
case
is
more
dangerous
that
darby
and
all
of
those
cases
without
returning
to
something
like
the
1930s.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
think
this
case
goes
beyond
wirtz,
i
do
not
think
this
case
is
very
threatening
to
federalism
at
all.
it
is
a
very
light
impact
upon
workers
of
really
a
menial
status
and
this
court
has
ample
means
of
using
the
federalism
value
to
limit
future
statutes
that
might
begin
to
move
towards
judges
or
legislators
or
do
something
terrible.
