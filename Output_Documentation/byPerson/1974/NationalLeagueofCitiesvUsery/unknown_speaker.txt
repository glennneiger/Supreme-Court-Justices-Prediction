unknown
speaker
where
did
that
95,000
originate,
mr.
rhyne.
unknown
speaker
--the
perez
case,
mr.
rhyne?
unknown
speaker
in
402
us,
case
of
perez,
which
it
is
not
your
field
of
the
law.
in
that
case
the
court,
upheld
the
constitutional
validity
under
the
commerce
clause
of
a
federal
law
that
made
local
loan
sharking
a
federal
criminal
offense.
unknown
speaker
and
in
which
the
course
of
its
opinion
the
court
dealt
with
the
general
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause,
are
you
familiar
with
that
case?
unknown
speaker
whatever
that
formulation
was,
would
wirtz
fall
within
it,
or
without
it?
unknown
speaker
you
think
in
those
situations
the
fair
labors
standards
act
application
should
be
accepted
in
terms
of
strictly
on
the
constitutional
basis.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
these
amendments
are
invalid
on
their
face
or
they
are
invalid
--
they
are
in
part
valid
and
in
part
invalid.
unknown
speaker
--with
the
doctrine
of
overbreadth
in
the
commerce
clause
there
is,
there
are
such
as
there
is
in
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
or
you
can
say
it
is
just
inseparable?
i
mean
you
can
say
it
in
terms
of
separability
the
statue
just
is
not
inseparable.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rhyne,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions.
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
the
whole
matter
went
back
to
congress
and
congress
held
some
hearings
and
found
that
there
were
some
police
strikes
and
there
really
were
95,000
people
who
were
underpaid
according
to
their
standards,
and
then
they
reenacted
the
statute.
would
we
have
a
different
constitutional
issue
than
we
have
today?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
suppose
they
were
the
police
and
fire
people,
supposing
there
are
95,000
policeman
and
they
have
engaged
in
strikes
and
so
forth,
would
that
be
a
different
constitutional
question
than
we
have?
unknown
speaker
that,
in
my
analysis
you
really
not
relying
on
the
absence
of
evidence
before
congress
but
rather
on
the
fact
that
this
is
an
area
which
congress
may
not
legislate
in.
unknown
speaker
the
second
question,
i
did
not
quite
understand,
i
am
not
sure
you
have
finished
your
development
to
the
point.
what
is
your
real
distinction
on
the
fry
case?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
did
rely
on
the
commerce
power
rather
than
your
power.
unknown
speaker
get
back
to
modern
times,
would
you
say
that
fry
did
not
help
either
side?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
about
fry,
is
there
a
distinction
between
that
case
and
this
one?
in
that
there
the
congress
said
to
the
state
you
must
not,
whereas
here
they
are
saying
to
the
states,
you
must.
unknown
speaker
not
a
distinction?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
rhyne,
i
think,
not
only
would
you
think
that
there
might
be
some
activities
of
states
and
cities
that
were
within
the
reach
of
the
commerce
power
and
some
that
are
not,
but
you
would
also
think
that
in
terms
of
whether
an
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
might
impair
the
functions
of
the
state,
there
might
be
some
exercises
of
power
and
fair
labor
standard
acts
that
might
threaten
of
local
government
and
some
that
might
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
maryland
against
wirtz
is
within
the--…
unknown
speaker
yet,
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
commerce
power
can
go
just
about
all
the
way
down
the
road,
so
far,
as
preempting
state
authority
over
private
business
and
yet
the
court
in
its
footnote
in
fry
last
year
and
you
in
your
argument
concede
that
there
is
a
limit
of
apparently
a
good
deal
of
short
of
there
when
you
are
dealing,
when
the
federal
government
is
dealing
with
the
state
as
a
state.
unknown
speaker
out
of
principle,
i
understand
you
say
that
if
this
case
is
decided
in
favor
of
the
government,
there
would
be
no
principal
way
to
avoid
holding
that
the
government
also
could
impose
ceilings
on
salaries
and
wages
--
unknown
speaker
proving
substantially
beyond
which
in
this
case
and
if
you
bear
in
mind
what
you
just
said
about
fry
as
justice
cardoza
said,
that
principle
is
commencing
to
run
a
bit
wild,
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
you
may
appeal
the
state's
choice
of
policy
is
unwise
but
it
is
every
bit
as
much
of
the
states
choice
there
as
was
the
states
presumably
before
wickard
against
filburn
to
allow
unlimited
production
of
wheat.
maybe
that
is
not
a
wise
choice,
but
it
is
nonetheless
the
state's
choice.
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
it
is
your
position
that
if
you
lose
this
case,
what
do
we
say
so
or
not,
wirtz
case
is
really
dead
or
really
should
be
dead.
unknown
speaker
and
in
all
fairness
to
the
law,
you
would
suggest
that
if
you
lose
this
case,
we
overrule
wirtz?
unknown
speaker
is
this
listed
on
your
‘no
discrimination’
test,
what
about
the
statute
that
said,
‘no
state
may
pay
its
judges
more
than
several
judges
are
paid’?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
and
meet
your
test.
unknown
speaker
in
fry,
the
elected
officials
were
not
included
because
under
the
ohio
statute,
they
were
not
covered,
but
were
not
they
covered
by
the
federal
regulation?
unknown
speaker
yes,
(inaudible)
ceiling
applied
across
the
board?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
constitution
prevents
congress
from
affecting
that
quality?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think,
you
might
think
judges
were
outside
its
reach?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
apply
the
perez
analysis,
you
can
define
a
class
which
would
include
judges,
class
of
employees
which
would
include
judges,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
are
they
by
affidavit
or
how
do
we
have
them?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
constitutional
principle.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
what
could
fairly
be
characterized
as
a
policy
position,
however
small
it
maybe
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
the
state
government
would
be
different
from
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
--
you
surprised
me,
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
think
of
this
as
a
matter
of
a
place
for
the
commerce
clause,
power
stops
or
a
place
where
despite
acknowledged
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
there
is
an
impediment
or
prohibition
in
the
constitution.
in
other
words,
let
me
and
i
borrow
this
from
brother
rehnquist's
dissent
in
fry,
congress
has
undoubted
power
on
the
commerce
clause,
i
would
suppose,
to
limit
the
content
of
what
should
be
published
in
interstate
magazines
--
magazines
that
go
on
the
state.
no
questions
of
its
power
in
the
commerce,
but
also
no
question
of
its
lack
of
power
to
do
that,
not
because
of
a
limitation
on
a
commerce
clause
but
because
of
the
prohibition
of
the
first
amendment,
that
is
what
you
are
into,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
a
prohibition
or
a
limitation
imposed
from
elsewhere
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
the
constitution
stops
it.
unknown
speaker
you
yourself
have
some
difficulties
that
seems
to
me
in
answering
justice
stewart's
earlier
question,
where
you
are
talking
about
a
maximum
salary
for
judges
and
you
say
congress
can
not
impose
that
and
presumably
because
of
some
sort
of
principles
of
federalism.
yet
it
is
perfectly
clear
i
would
think
under
jones
and
laughlin
that
congress
can
impose
a
maximum
salary
on
any
president
of
a
business
located
within
the
judge
jurisdiction
and
the
reason
for
that
that
there
is
no
federalism
principle
there
or
at
least
none
that
has
ever
been
enunciated
by
this
court.
unknown
speaker
it
never
has
prevailed,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
then
your
assurances
to
the
various
members
of
the
court
that
when
we
get
to
a
really
tough
case
of
the
impairment
of
state
sovereignty
in
the
sense
effecting
the
state
as
a
state,
will
have
a
remedy,
is
really
illusory
because
you
cannot
tell
me
that
perez,
if
the
perez
line
of
reasoning
governs
this
type
of
case
we
are
talking
about
the
state,
that
there
is
any
stopping
place,
there
isn’t!
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
the
commerce
power
and
if
is
your
submission
and
that
is
all
is
involved
here,
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
in
federalism
address
are
present
in
the
perez
type
case
as
there
are
in
this
type
case.
unknown
speaker
does
the
court
perez
passed
any
conceivable
stopping
point
as
far
as
commerce
power?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
rhyne
before
you
start,
i
would
like
to
mention
a
thought
that
has
been
running
through
my
mind
and
give
you
a
chance
to
comment
on
that.
article
4
provides
that
united
states
should
guarantee
each
state
a
republican
form
of
government.
and
the
court
as
you
know
is
held
that
questions
under
that
section
are
political
in
character.
as
i
listen
to
this
solicitor
general
characterized
you
argument
about
policy
and
the
disastrous
effect
of
this
statute
on
the
states,
it
occurred
to
me
that
your
clients
are
in
a
peculiarly
effective
position
to
make
their
arguments
known
to
the
congress.
i
wonder
if
you
would
comment
on
whether
or
not
this
is
the
kind
of
problem
that
could
best
be
addressed
by
congress.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
is
congress's
perfect
right
to
confer
a
course
of
action,
to
go
on
the
federal
court
if
that
the
statute
is
valid.
