justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
we
are
talking
today
about
a
case
that
involves
the
regulation
by
the
federal
government
of
wages
and
certain
conditions
of
employment
of
state
and
localities,
so
we
do
not
have
to
go
quite
as
far.
i
feel
that
as
you
suggested
a
moment
ago,
and
answer
the
question
i
am
not
going
to
put
to
you.
in
fry,
we
dealt
not
with
putting
a
floor
on
the
wages,
but
we
are
putting
a
ceiling,
not
only
on
wages,
but
on
all
the
salaries
of
state
and
local
governments.
in
your
brief,
in
your
supplemental
brief,
you
said
that
principle
of
fry
controls
this
case.
suppose
that
the
congress
had
this
session,
where
to
enact
the
statute
i
recognized
the
political
unpopularity
of
it
but
we
are
dealing
with
principle
not
politics,
i
hope
at
the
moment.
assuming
the
power
to
regulate
the
ceiling.
in
other
words,
enacting
controls
on
what
the
states
could
pay
that
people
at
all
levels,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
do
not
wish
to
interrupt
you
except
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
i
have
no
interest
in
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
speak
only
for
myself.
i
am
concerned
with
whether
or
not,
if
we
decide
this
case
in
favor
of
the
government,
there
will
indeed
be
any
limitation,
as
to
how
far
the
federal
government
can
go
in
regulating
the
affairs
of
the
states
and
localities
themselves,
give
me
the
power
of
test,
give
me
the
power
to
decide
what
you
are
paid,
i
control
you.
i
think
that
is
inevitable.
i
would
like
to
stick
to
the
principle,
i
am
not
the
least
bit
interested
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
any
of
my
friend,
charlie
rhyne's
arguments
about
the
dreadful
results
to
individuals.
i
am
thinking
about
the
long
time
doctrine
of
federalism
that
seems
to
me
to
be
on
the
verge
of
being
destroyed
by
vesting
in
the
federal
government,
they
are
to
put
some
floors
under
and
ceilings
over,
the
wages
of
federal
and
state
employees.
let
me
ask
you
this,
we
will
move
to
slightly
different
area,
the
governor
of
utah
put
some
cases
that
i
think
illustrate
the
problem.
does
the
congress
have
the
power
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
to
say
to
the
states
that
they
must
--
that
they
have
authority
to
outlaw
strikes
against
the
government
by
employees?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
would
allow
strikes
against
--
yet
at
the
federal
level,
it
also
could
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
have
been
thinking
about
your
suggestion
that
perhaps
federalism
would
be
saved
and
quite
at
least,
if
the
federal
government
were
required
not
to
impose
any
different
limitations
or
different
obligations
on
the
states
that
is
willing
to
impose
on
itself,
but
does
not
that
cut
against
the
basic
tenet,
one
of
them
of
federalism
that
allows
the
diversity
and
for
experimentation
and
would
in
fact
you
be
comforted
to
any,
if
you
were
judge
in
utah
or
judge
in
new
york
or
california
where
the
salaries
are
higher
than
federal
judges.
if
you
were
told
that
you
will
be
exactly
like
the
federal
judges
in
washington
or
take
the
case
of
government
from
utah
which
is
relatively
rural
state
with
wage
levels
perhaps,
presumably
far
lower
than
there
in
new
york
city
or
washington
dc,
simply
because
somebody
up
here
in
washington
imposes
on
you,
the
same
rules
and
regulations
it
is
willing
to
operate
on
a
totally
different
environment,
it
does
not
seems
to
be
very
helpful.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
promoted
by
homogenizing
the
whole
country
in
the
way
you
suggest.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
towards
that
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
i
come
back
to
justice
rehnquist's
distinction.
this
case,
arguably,
is
different.
i
realize
you
have
a
different
view
but
i
say
arguably,
this
is
the
first
major
intrusion
starting
with
west
that
i
know
of,
in
which
the
federal
government
is
saying
to
the
states
and
localities,
“we
are
going
to
run
your
labor
policies
and
fix
your
wages
and
salaries,”
that
is
a
major
departure
as
i
view
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(voice

freedom
of
the
state,
the
function
that
you
suggest
if
these
wages
were
set
at
a
limit
that
it
had
it
(inaudible),
then
maybe
you
have
a
different
case
but
it
would
start
down
this
road
as
a
principle,
it
is
hard
to
see
why
one
would
stop
(voice

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
have
been
taking
a
bit
of
just
drawing
the
distinction
between
policy
makers.
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
we
are
taking
about
the
superintendent
of
education
of
a
state,
and
you
would
say
i
take
it
that
the
federal
government
would
not
have
power
to
regulate
his
salary
but
obviously,
would
have
power
to
regulate
under
the
argument
you
advance,
the
salaries
of
people
whom
he
employs?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
am
going
up
to
an
immediate
level
and
let
us
see
what
is
your
position
is.
suppose
he
has
as
state
superintendent,
necessarily
do
have
20
or
30
quite
key
positions
in
the
organization,
maybe
a
50
or
100
depending
on
the
size
of
the
state,
are
they
policy-making
people
or
--
