mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellants
here
states
and
cities
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
some
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
covered
the
--
all
the
remaining
employees
of
states
and
cities
under
that
act.
the
way
it
was
done
was
by
declaring
all
states
and
all
cities
to
be
commercial
enterprises
and
under
that
enterprise
interpretation
to
apply
all
of
the
regulations
of
the
act
to
the
states
and
cities.
but
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
a
minimum
wage
case.
it
isn't
a
case
involving
the
low
paid
people.
it's
the
application
of
this
act
to
their
relatively
high
paid
people,
the
wiping
out
of
state
and
local
government
civil
service
laws,
processes,
procedures,
the
forced
restructuring
of
the
way
that
they
will
render
far
service
for
example,
it
is
the
--
which
results
in
enormous
increases
in
cost.
these
are
the
things
that
the
states
and
the
cities
complain
of
and
say
to
this
court
that
this
act
is
really
a
very
massive
complex
regulatory
act
which
in
affect
reaches
every
employee,
be
he
working
in
the
executive,
legislative,
or
judicial
branches
of
state
government.
now,
there
are
some
exemptions
for
elected
officials
and
their
confidential
age
and
for
professional
people.
but,
the
interesting
thing
about
the
application
of
this
act
in
the
claim
repeatedly
that
is
to
correct
substandard
labor
conditions
is
that
in
the
entire
record
made
over
three
or
four
years
in
the
congress,
the
appellee's
predecessors
in
the
department
of
labor
were
only
able
to
find
they
claim.
95,000
people
out
of
11,400,000
who
in
1973
they
thought
could
be
covered
by
this
act,
who
where
getting
less
than
the
minimum
wage
and
we
doubt
frankly
that
figure
because
it
shows
here
in
the
record
that
firefighters
get
$12,000.00
a
year,
the
highly
publicized
new
york
garbage
collectors
and
sweepers
get
$20,000.00
up
to
$24,500.00,
and
out
in
san
francisco,
they
get
almost
as
much.
so
we're
not
talking
about
minimum
wages,
we're
not
talking
about
substandard
conditions.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
basic
restructuring
of
government
in
the
united
states
of
america,
big
change
in
our
federal
system
of
government
whereby
for
the
first
time,
in
all
history,
the
federal
government
is
asserting
power
over
every
state,
over
every
city
and
every
employee
they
have.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that
because
as
appellee
admits,
you
have
to
keep
a
record
for
even
the
exempt
people.
so
this
is
a
massive
takeover,
it's
in
the
massive
overlapping
duplication,
nullification
of
civil
service,
debt
limit,
tax
limit,
budget
limit
laws
and
it
affects
this
vast
change
in
power
and
we
talked
mostly
about
power.
appellee
talks
about
payroll
cost
and
say
they
are
nothing
but
we
talk
about
power
of
government
and
we
say
here
that
the
federal
government
is
asserting
jurisdiction
for
the
first
time
over
their
most
important
element
in
every
state
and
local
budget
for
personnel
cost.
cities
have
80%
to
85%
of
their
budget
in
personnel
cost.
states,
california
has
76%
and
other
states
are
similar.
so,
we
say
that
this
act
is
a
massive
takeover
of
functions
that
had
been
performed
on
the
local
level
since
the
founding
of
our
nation.
i
used
one
illustration
of
the
wiping
out
of
ballot
box
control.
in
the
record
pages
4,
14
and
following,
there's
a
copy
of
the
new
jersey
statute.
that
statute
applies
to
the
platoon
system
for
fireman.
it
says
you
have
the
fireman
on
24
hours,
off
24
hours,
and
they
can
work
56
hours
a
week,
but
only
after
that
has
been
approved
by
referendum
of
the
local
voters
and
no
one
can
look.
if
the
regulations
were
promulgated
on
the
20th
of
december
1974
by
the
wage
in
our
administrator
for
the
secretary
of
labor
and
not
see
that
this
new
jersey
statute
is
wiped
out
completely.
and
all
across
this
nation
from
the
new
england
town
meetings
to
the
referenda
that
they
are
so
popular
at
west
where
they
have
a
referenda
almost
on
everything,
every
time
we
have
had
a
fundamental
increase
in
money
or
fundamental
change
in
providing
unique
services
uniquely
needed
by
a
particular
city
or
state
because
of
geography
and
other
reasons,
there's
always
the
possibility
new
other
people
voting
on
it
as
they
did
in
new
jersey.
but
under
this
act
and
under
the
actions
of
the
appellee
that
ballot
box
control
is
gone
forever.
now,
this
act
as
i
say
is
a
massive
imposition
down
at
top
of
massive
legislation
that's
already
in
effect,
affecting
states
and
cities.
this
is
where
they
spend
most
of
their
money.
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
didn't
mean
to
hit
you.
they
spend
as
i
say,
85%
of
their
money
on
personnel
and
they
have
a
very
--
carefully
down
through
the
years
developed
civil
service
and
tenure
laws
for
their
people.
and
now,
instead
of
--
and
i
think
this
illustrates
it
best.
instead
of
looking
to
the
city
council,
looking
to
the
local
processes,
procedures,
the
civil
service
commission
of
the
city
of
new
york
are
the
civil
service
commission
in
the
state
in
new
york.
what
they
do
here
is
they
look
to
the
appellee,
the
secretary
of
labor
and
they
looked
to
the
congress
because
once
this
power
is
established,
every
kind
of
employee
in
this
whole
nation
has
to
go
to
the
congress
or
can
go
to
congress
to
get
their
employment
status
changed.
so
they
no
longer
look
to
city
hall,
they
no
longer
look
to
the
state
capitol.
this
is
a
vast
change
in
the
outlook
and
the
power
and
it's
the
centralization
here
in
the
federal
government
of
power
over
the
most
important
group,
because
the
cities
are
bundles
of
legal
powers.
they
can
only
act
through
people
and
this
act
touches
every
one
of
them.
it's
an
assertion
of
sovereign
power
over
every
employee
of
a
state
and
city
throughout
the
nation.
one
of
the
experts
that
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to,
to
nail
down
how
complex,
to
nail
down
how
massive,
to
nail
down
the
fact
that
this
is
a
double
standard
of
hours
and
wages
is
the
chairman
of
the
civil
service
commission.
the
chairman
of
the
civil
service
commission
appeared
and
i
quote
from
about
three
sentences
from
page
9
of
our
brief.
he
appeared
on
the
26th
of
february
1975
before
the
committee
on
post
office
and
civil
service
in
the
house
of
representative
and
this
is
what
he
said,“the
extension
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
federal
employment
is
a
case
in
point.
it
adds
a
new
set
of
complex
provisions
to
the
already
existing
provisions
of
title
v.
it
creates
two
standards,
governing
pay
and
hours
of
work.
it
results
in
double
record
keeping
and
double
work.
it
is
an
extremely
high
administrative
cost
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i'm
reading
three
sentences
from
page
9
of
our
brief
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
certainly
is.
i
think
commerce
is
commerce
and
business
is
business.
and
in
this
area
here,
you
didn't
have
a
lot
of
private
business
that
had
laws.
you
see,
private
business
can't
legislate,
adjudicate
tax
and
so
they're
an
entirely
different
category
than
the
private
businessman.
he
can
immediately
adjust
to
take
care
of
any
cost.
so
these
in
states
have
to
give
all
kinds
of
notices
or
a
wait
until
you
come
around
for
the
next
budget
year
and
things
like
that.
so,
i
am
not
sure
at
all
that
darby
presented
the
same
kind
of
impact.
i
don't
think
so
because
you
didn't
have
the
civil
service
laws
in
states
similar
to
the
federal
service
law.
you
didn't
have
all
of
these
appeals
that
you
have
there
through
civil
service
commissions
or
personnel
commissions.
you
didn't
have
all
of
that
kind
of
thing
and
you
certainly
didn't
have
the
volunteer
situation
in
darby.
so,
i
think
this
is
entirely
different
in
--
actually,
the
basis
of
our
whole
argument
is
the
distinction
between
government
and
commerce.
and
so,
i
would
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
we
have
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
have
here
presented
the
massive
impact
of
this
act
upon
states
and
cities
looked
upon
as
an
entirety.
now
in
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
not.
i
would
say
in
maryland
v.
wirtz
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
--
i
would
like
to
see
it
overruled.
there
are
some
distinctions
but
i
can't
tell
you
that
--
what
the
distinctions
i
draw.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
but
i
think
it
should
be.
i
think
like
the
lower
court
which
said
it
was
troubled
and
that
the
broad
language
of
wirtz
that
this
court
might
want
to
call
back
from.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i'm
just
thinking
of
this
one
right
now.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
why
isn't
it?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
all
right.
i
think
you
should
overrule
it
number
one,
because
it
is
so
fuzzy.
you
can't
really
tell.
i'm
going
to
the
ultimate
now
what
it
decided.
you
left
open
for
example
the
ultimate
consumer
question
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
why
is
it?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
because
after
looking
at
the
enterprise
system
and
upholding
it
as
applied
to
all
these
private
business
criteria
and
all
those
private
business
cases,
the
next
thing
the
court
did,
the
majority
opinion
was
to
say
now
that
we
have
upheld
that
act
as
applied
to
this
criteria
of
nexus
to
commerce
that's
always
been
applied
in
a
private
business
thing,
we
don't
find
enough
of
impact
on
states
here
to
bring
the
tenth
amendment
into
focus.
now,
of
course
hospitals
and
schools,
they
don't
legislate,
adjudicate
or
tax,
and
so,
there's
an
--
and
then
to
the
--
the
court
pointed
out,
there's
a
court
below
who
found
that
these
schools
and
hospitals
were
in
competition
with
the
private
business.
so,
i
would
say
to
you
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
presenting
an
entirely
different
in
many
ways,
factual
picture
to
you
and
we
think
that
distinguishes
wirtz
there,
but
we
also
think
that
as
the
dissent
in
wirtz
said,
“if
we
uphold
this
enterprise
system
as
to
schools
and
hospitals,
then
the
congress
can
declare
an
entire
state
or
an
enterprise
and
the
federal
government
can
regulate
its
entire
budget.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
distinction
is
out.
i
withdraw
mr.
chief
justice
are
these:
number
one,
the
court
didn't
decide
this
ultimate
consumer
question
you
have
here
now
before
you
in
brennan
v.
iowa.
number
two,
it
seems
to
limit
the
application
of
the
act
to
those
schools
and
hospitals
who
are
in
competition
with
private
schools
and
hospitals.
and
then
finally,
it
seemed
to
say
to
the
dissenters
when
they
say
you
can
take
over
a
whole
state
by
declaring
an
enterprise.
the
comment
was
not
while
this
court
sits.
so,
i
think
that
there
are
factual
distinctions
there
which
showed
that
wirtz
hasn't
had
the
impact
on
state
and
local
government
that
this
massive
takeover
that
we
have
here
has
had.
so
--
but
i
still
think
that
the
court
should
have
in
wirtz
considered
the
principles
of
constitutional
federalism
which
we
urge
upon
this
court
and
it
didn't.
it
just
said
because
we've
already
upheld
this,
commercial
enterprise,
the
tenth
amendment
doesn't
mean
anything.
we
go
ahead
and
apply
it.
so,
i
would
say
to
maryland
versus
wirtz
that
it
does
not
control
this
case
because
i
draw
from
the
principles
of
constitutional
federalism
and
certainly,
we
have
in
our
briefs
going
into
this
very,
very
deeply.
this
general
rule
that
under
the
constitution
at
it
was
written
even
prior
to
the
tenth
amendment,
all
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
enunciating
this
idea
that
the
federal
government
could
not
and
would
not
interfere
with
the
states
in
their
area
of
operation
as
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
said
in
mculloch
v.
maryland
and
vice
versa.
there
would
be
no
interference.
and
where
do
i
find
that
rule?
well,
i
find
it
in
the
debates
on
the
constitution
of
1787.
i
find
it
in
the
federalist
papers.
i
find
it
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
find
it
in
statements
of
two
secretaries
of
labor
who
opposed
the
application
of
this
act
to
states
and
cities
because
it
would
be
an
undue
interference
and
undue
disruption
and
might
bankrupt
some
of
the
small
cities
of
this
nation.
i
find
it
in
the
veto
message
of
one
president.
i
find
it
in
the
statements
by
the
intergovernmental
relations
commission,
which
is
the
expert
commission
set
up
to
look
at
these
things.
i
also
find
it
overwhelmingly
in
the
interpretation
which
the
congress
itself
has
given
to
this
intergovernmental
relationship
from
the
beginning
of
our
constitution
until
now.
in
statute
after
statute,
they
have
exempted
states
and
cities
for
this
very
constitutional
reason
and
even
in
this
act
up
until
1966,
it
was
complete
exemption,
they
didn't
take
out
that
complete
exemption
until
they
brought
public
agencies
in
now
as
commercial
enterprises.
so,
i
think
our
founding
fathers
understood
the
difference
between
government
and
private
business
all
through
that
constitution.
there's
more
than
a
hundred
mentions
of
states,
only
states
can
bring
an
original
action
here,
no
private
person
can
do
that.
i
believe
there
has
been
an
awful
lot
of
fuzzy
thinking
about
everything
in
our
whole
nation
being
commerce
and
it
isn't.
certainly,
the
act
of
a
policeman
in
making
an
arrest
isn't
commerce.
the
act
of
a
fireman
in
putting
out
a
fire
isn't
commerce.
the
act
of
a
judge
of
a
state
or
of
a
city
in
deciding
a
case
isn't
commerce.
the
action
of
a
zoning
board
in
deciding
a
zoning,
it
isn't
commerce.
now,
all
of
this
kind
of
thing
mr.
justice
white
was
not
presented
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
i've
read
all
the
briefs
in
that
case
and
there's
no
reference
to
it
in
the
majority
opinion.
and
i
think
these
are
the
kind
of
things
that
the
dissenters
were
concerned
with
when
they
were
saying
you
get
a
mighty
small
little
perspective
on
this
whole
problem
when
there
is
looking
at
hospitals
and
schools.
and
now,
we're
presenting
the
whole
picture,
and
when
you
look
at
the
whole
picture,
there's
certainly
a
massive
intrusion,
a
massive
control
by
the
federal
government
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
our
nation
of
every
person,
every
service
rendered
by
states
or
cities
because
what
this
act
does
is
it
re-spummels
the
way
they're
going
to
do
for
service,
it
re-spummels
the
way
you're
going
to
do
a
lot
of
things.
and
we
say
that
it
imposes
enormous
cost
and
when
you
impose
enormous
cost,
that's
one
thing,
but
the
big
thing
we
talked
about
is
the
shift
in
power,
the
shift
in
power
from
the
states
to
the
federal
government.
now,
do
we
want
it?
isn't
this
a
massive
interference
with
our
constitutional
system
of
shared
powers,
our
federal
system?
we
talked
about
federalism,
federalism,
federalism.
well,
federalism
has
served
this
nation
very
well
and
up
until
now,
states
and
cities
who
are
urged
have
fairly
taken
care
of
their
employees,
who
have
collective
bargaining
of
statutes
and
agreements
and
there
are
thousands
of
their
members
belong
to
unions
as
you
can
see
from
the
amicus
brief
here.
all
of
that
was
never
forcefully
presented
as
far
as
i
can
tell
in
maryland
versus
wirtz.
and
here,
i
could
not
say
it
--
more
strongly
than
i
have,
i
just
think
that
we're
looking
at
such
a
major
shift
of
governmental
power
in
our
nation.
something
we
have
never
had
before
and
when
you
look
at
the
necessity
of
it,
what
does
the
appellee
said?
he
says
that
in
1973
when
they
were
considering
this
act,
it
would
only
increase
the
payroll
cost
of
states
and
cities
three-tenths
of
1%.
he
says
also
in
1974,
it
only
increase
the
payroll
cost
and
that
would
be
$120
million
a
year
incidentally.
and
in
1974,
it
would
increase
the
payroll
cost
only
one-half
of
1%
or
$165
million.
he
says
these
police
and
fire
regulations
that
he
put
out
in
december
will
only
cost
$27
million.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
all
employees
of
states
and
cities
are
covered
because
you
have
to
keep
a
record
on
each
of
them.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
11,400,000.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
under
the
professional
exemption
and
such?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
we
have
a
great
dispute
among
us
is
to
how
many
that
is,
the
elected
people.
so
i
think
the
safest
thing
for
me
just
to
say
is;
we
are
looking
at
the
whole
of
it
because
they
require
that
a
record
be
kept
with
respect
to
the
state
court
judges,
all
the
exempt
people.
so
i
think
that
the
pervasive
nature
of
it,
the
fact
that
it
touches
everybody
that
a
state
or
city
employed,
i
don't
think
can
be
dispute.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
changes
in
the
slightest,
because
de
minimus
impact
doesn't
create
constitutional
power
and
as
i
read;
all
the
background
of
the
constitution
and
history
of
it
up
until
now.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
doesn't
show
it
absolutely
your
honor.
they
try
to
contend.
of
course,
there
are
very
few
covered
and
we
say
well
everybody
is
covered,
and
we
don't
have
figures
as
to
the
exact
numbers.
now,
they
claim
that
very
few
were
covered
under
the
hospital,
thing
very
few
covered
here.
i
think
they
would
probably
claim
that
less
than
half
of
all
the
11
million
and
4
are
covered.
but
i
say
that
has
no
constitutional
significance
because
they
claim
power
over
them
all.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
i
think
they
will
admit
up
to
six
million.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
--
they
say
that
has
a
--
only
a
showing
that
they're
not
covering
everything.
i
don't
call
it
de
minimus
either.
but,
they
are
attacking
the
statement
made
by
congress
that
because
in
the
overtime
area
for
example,
states
and
cities
have
such
fair
overtime
premium
laws
now
that
there
would
be
less
than
1%
added
to
the
payrolls
by
the
new
overtime
provision
of
this
act
and
things
like
that.
now,
i
just
think
that
de
minimus,
de
minimus,
de
minimus,
doesn't
create
constitutional
power.
and
i
find
here
in
all
of
this
history
of
constitutional
federalism
a
sturdy,
steady
unwavering
adherence
by
everyone
up
until
now
including
the
decision
to
this
court
that
the
constitutional
federalism
is
something
that
limits
everything
where
you
have
--
in
the
constitution
where
you
have
a
conflict
between
two
governments.
you
have
the
tax
power,
you
have
the
bankruptcy
power
where
time
and
time
again
this
court
had
said
hands
off
states,
hands
of
cities.
you
have
cases
like
in
the
transportation
field
where
over
maryland
versus
johnson
for
example
where
the
court
held
and
mr.
justice
holmes
wrote
the
opinion.
he
said,
“don't
try
to
get
us
to
decide
this
on
these
commerce
cases
involving
private
entry
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
government.”
and
so
on
the
basis
that
he
held
it
was
invalid
from
maryland
to
charge
a
postal
truck
driver
a
$3.00
driver's
license
fee.
so,
the
amount
regardless
of
how
many
you
have
on
either
side
should
not
decide
this
case
because
i
think
on
this
record,
it
is
beyond
question
that
the
congress
is
claiming
power
to
regulate
every
state
and
city
employee.
and
i
believe
that
the
factual
picture
of
this
overwhelming
massive
change
in
government,
the
centralization
here
of
everything
with
everybody
running
to
the
congress
as
they
want
to
change
in
time
or
in
their
personnel
status.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
take
it
that
my
distinguished
adversary
admits
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
constitutional
federalism
that
exist
but
he
says
unless
an
act
of
congress,
if
i
heard
him
right,
unless
an
act
of
congress
really
wipes
out
the
ability
of
a
state
government
to
be
a
viable
government,
you
don't
call
it
into
play
as
a
bar
against
legislation.
now,
he
says
that
the
states
are
not
hurt
here,
that
this
isn't
enough
of
an
intrusion.
but
i
call
again
to
the
courts
attention
the
$3.00-license
fee
was
too
much
for
mr.
justice
holmes
in
johnson
versus
maryland
when
you're
taking
about
a
matter
of
power.
we're
talking
about
a
matter
of
governmental
power.
we're
not
talking
so
much
about
money
but
on
money.
they
say
that
our
figures
are
exaggerated.
well,
the
record
proved
just
to
the
contrary,
this
man
who
gave
us
the
$200
million
estimate
of
cost
on
fire
service
to
comply
with
his
act
as
a
greatest
expert
in
the
united
states
on
this
subject.
and
there's
one
other
little
thing
distinguished
solicitor
general
keeps
talking
about
confusion.
if
there
is
anyone
thing
that
is
confused
in
his
whole
argument,
it's
this.
he
talks
about
working
60
hours
or
84
hours.
now,
the
plain
truth
is
that
of
that
60
hours
or
that
56
hours
in
new
jersey,
so
much
of
it
is
what
you
call
standby
time.
in
the
record
at
page
321,
it's
pointed
out
that
when
you're
on
duty
for
24
hours
and
then
24
hours,
that
you
have
--
in
that
24
hours,
the
first
24
hours,
he
has
16
hours
of
standby
time.
so,
these
people
are
there
but
only
the
difference
between
16
hours
and
24
is
work-related
time.
the
most
popular
jobs
in
the
united
states
are
these
firemen's
job
because
they
don't
have
work
related
all
the
time.
now
the
other
thing
is
that
these
regulations
that
were
put
out
on
the
20th
of
december
last
year,
they
provide
this,
that
if
that
firemen
is
new
jersey
under
that
new
jersey
statute
which
over
on
page
414,
415
or
appendix
works
24
hours,
you
cannot
under
the
federal
--
the
new
federal
rule,
you
can't
deduct
sleep
and
eat
time.
and
you
see
what
that
does
immediately
when
he
comes
to
the
next
24
hours,
he's
very
quickly
into
overtime.
and
we're
not
talking
about
substandard
wages
here.
we're
talking
about
people
who
earn
$20,000,
$25,000,
or
$30,000
or
more
a
year
working
overtime.
this
idea,
the
most
false
idea
that
has
been
put
forth
is
that
substandard
labor
conditions
exist
in
state
and
local
governments,
they
do
not.
and
you
notice
how
clever
it
is
--
they
start
out
by
saying,
we're
talking
about
409,000,
314
of
those
were
really
covered
in
1966;
nothing
has
been
done
about
them.
we
only
have
95
new
people
who
we
claim
are
getting
a
salary
below
the
minimum
wage.
and
we
tried
to
find
out
who
they
are,
well
it's
just
a
statistic
that
somehow
rather,
somebody
has
come
up
with
down
it
to
the
department
of
labor,
you
can't
trace
them
down.
and
i
say
they
don't
exist
and
we've
said
that
throughout.
there
is
no
substandard
labor
conditions
among
states
and
cities.
they
live
with
these.
they're
not
going
to
starve
them
to
death
and
justice
in
new
jersey,
if
they're
going
to
go
to
a
new
platoon
system,
if
they're
going
change
the
overall
pay,
these
people
in
the
new
england
town
meeting
or
crosses
country,
they've
vote
on
it.
after
now,
they
have
been
able
to
vote
on
nothing.
the
most
important
question
was
from
mr.
justice
brennan
when
he
talked
about
the
republican
form
of
government
because
the
biggest
part
of
that
republican
form
of
government
if
ballot
box
control
and
mr.
justice
brennan
is
gone
if
this
act
is
upheld.
now,
my
distinguished
colleague,
the
governor
of
utah,
governor
hampton,
leaned
over
to
me
and
he
made
a
statement
that
i
think
i
should
pass
onto
you.
he
said,
“if
they
uphold
this,
there
is
no
other
stopping
place.”
from
that
complete
swallowing
up
of
state
government
under
the
commerce
clause
and
there
is
no
logical
place,
just
on
and
on.
you
talked
about
the
nice
labor
relations
act,
well,
those
acts
are
all
being
held
over
here
in
committees
on
congress
that
you
act
on
this.
if
you
uphold
this,
frankly,
cities
are
gone.
their
commercial
enterprises
and
i
just
don't
believe
that
anyone
can't
read
the
history
of
our
nation
when
you
come
to
a
new
claim
of
power,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
sources
of
power.
and
i
mentioned
it
was
made
for
the
solicitor
general
about
is
being
so
amenable.
it
didn't
have
any
impact
at
all.
but
i
will
remind
the
court,
i'll
remind
the
court
as
i
was
reminded
again
by
governor
hampton
that
the
impact
of
tea
tax
in
boston
was
minimal
but
the
principal
was
more
than
the
people
could
stand
to
have
someone
else
taxing
them,
someone
else
running
their
local
affairs
and
this
is
what
the
states
and
cities
are
fighting
for
here.
that's
exactly
what
they're
fighting
for
here.
now
this
idea
that
this
act
has
no
payroll
impact,
it
not
only
a
false
statement
but
that
is
not
a
point
at
all.
the
point
is
who
is
going
to
determine
that
payroll
impact
and
this
is
just
the
beginning,
the
camel's
nose
under
the
tip
--
that's
certainly
very,
very
true.
and
look
at
the
enormous
impact
or
just
this
one
ruling
that
a
fireman
who
works
24
hours
on
the
job,
you
can't
deduct
his
sleep
and
eat
time.
but
for
every
other
person
in
the
entire
nation,
you
can.
so,
there's
no
misunderstanding
on
our
part.
we
know
what
this
act
says
and
he
tries
to
justify
it
by
saying,
“oh
well,
this
might
help
welfare.
it
might
unemployment.”
and
then
he
said,
“in
any
event,
we
give
$52
billion
in
revenue
sharing,”
well
again
putting
governor
hampton's
note
to
me,
he
said
he
is
very
presumptuous
to
imply
that
state
sovereignty
is
for
sale
for
$52
billion
or
any
other
term.
and
after
all,
that
money
is
the
people
money
just
being
returned
to
them.
the
idea
that
you
can
pay
for
it
and
take
over
the
states
is
totally
repugnant
to
our
whole
system
of
government.
i
believe
that
the
concession
both
by
the
solicitor
general,
by
the
congress
in
it's
report
that
this
would
have
virtually
no
impact
on
the
cities,
the
concession
by
senators
javits
and
williams
in
their
brief
that
it
will
have
no
impact,
why
do
it?
why
take
over?
and
statement
about
california,
that's
completely
wrong.
sleep
and
eat
time
is
included
in
84
hours
to
72
hours
or
60
hours,
it
has
been
up
until
now,
and
the
only
thing
that
they
say,
they
say
they're
not
forcing
states
or
cities
do
anything;
they
are.
this
24-hour
no
sleep-no
eat
thing
is
going
to
force
them
to
hire
an
awful
lot
of
new
firemen
and
maybe
some
new
police
and
as
mr.
jones
pointed
out,
is
a
very,
very
costly
things
to
hire
and
train
all
of
these
people.
after
all
the
states
and
cities
have
gotten
along
pretty
good
up
until
now
and
again
i
would
reiterate
over
and
over
again,
over
and
over
again,
there
are
no
substandard
labor
conditions,
there
is
no
justification
for
this
act.
anyway,
anyhow,
no
matter
how
you
approach
it,
and
the
one
thing
also
that
i
think
is
not
particularly
happy
thing
to
have
represented
to
this
court
that
the
governors
and
mayors
who
presented
these
figures
that
were
included
here
of
200
million
and
a
billion
in
cost
are
liars.
i
don't
think
they
are.
i
think
they
can
make
just
as
good
estimates
as
a
lot
of
other
people
and
i
think
they
made
honest
testament.
they
are
honest
people,
they
are
hardworking
people
and
they
live
there
with
their
own
people.
and
so,
i
think
they
gave
their
very
best
estimates
and
certainly
this,
well,
for
example,
in
the
house
committee
report,
they
estimate
it,
the
first
year
impact
of
this
act
on
the
entire
federal
government,
do
you
know
what
it
was?
250,000.
i
saw
the
post
master
general
sitting
back
here
a
few
minutes
ago
and
i
saw
a
statement
by
him
the
other
day
that
$68
million
of
his
deficit
is
caused
by
this
act.
i
tried
awfully
hard
to
and
i
found
a
publication
to
that
effect.
i
tried
awfully
hard
to
get
some
other
figures
but
all
they
tell
me
is
this
is
awful,
you
can't
get
it.
and
the
idea
that
the
civil
service
of
the
unites
states
and
the
civil
service
of
the
states
is
different,
it's
just
plain
did
wrong.
so,
mr.
hampton
is
right.
you
got
all
of
these
statutes
of
states,
he
did
been
building
up
for
200
years,
trying
to
be
fair
with
these
people
and
after
all,
if
their
not
fair,
they
are
there
to
tell
them
about
it.
they
live
with
them,
day-in
and
day-out.
and
so,
i
think
that
here
where
this
act
really
obliterates
the
division
or
governmental
power
upon
which
are
whole
nation
is
founded.
now
is
the
time
and
governor
hampton
view.
and
the
view
of
the
governors
he
represents
is
chairman
of
all
of
the
mayors
and
other
public
officials,
now
is
the
time
to
call
to
put
a
stop
to
this,
let's
call
government-government
and
commerce-commerce
and
not
try
to
turn
just
by
a
few
words,
whoever
heard
of
the
statute?
this
one
i've
every
seen
where
it
calls
commercial
enterprises
government
and
over
and
over
again
defines
and
so
write
in
the
statute,
they
say
our
commercial
enterprise
is
a
city,
public
agency,
well,
that's
not
true.
this
idea
of
competition
that
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
wirtz,
well
the
court
below
found
there
was
no
competition
here.
they
don't
like
that.
the
idea
that
somehow
rather
because
government
might
compete
with
each
other,
well
that's
preposterous,
the
only
competition
i
ever
see
is
when
they
bid
against
each
other
for
a
city
manager
to
improve
their
whole
operations
of
government.
so,
i
would
just
correct
one
other
things,
i
have
a
letter
here
from
the
governor
of
colorado
instructing
his
attorney
general
to
withdraw
his
name
from
that
brief
that
was
just
called
your
attention.
so,
in
the
idea
of
the
solicitor
general
said
all
you
got
to
do
is
comply
with
7
(k)
and
then
you
have
no
problem.
well
if
you
comply
with
7
(k),
you
have
to
comply
with
this
rule
24-hours
on,
you
don't
deduct
sleep
and
eat.
so,
i
come
back,
i
started
out
by
saying
that
we
don't
have
substandard
conditions
here.
and
what
do
they
come
up
with
this
figure
of
95,000
faceless
wonders
that
they
got
from
nowhere
and
there's
no
evidence
whatever,
not
once
until
that
those
95,000
exist
and
without
that,
the
substandard
idea
is
gone
forever.
cities
are
not
here
to
fighting
to
maintain
substandard
labor
conditions,
states
are
not
here
fighting
to
maintain
substandard
living
conditions,
these
are
their
people.
they
live
with
them
and
we
feel
that
they
should
continue
as
they
have
for
200
years
and
to
tear
up
this
system
of
shared
governmental
powers
that
has
worked
so
well
and
this
bicentennial
year
would
be
a
monstrosity
indeed.
i
end
by
saying
government
is
not
commerce,
and
i
ask
the
court
to
recognize
that
‘government
is
government
and
commerce
is
commerce'
and
that
this
decision
below
should
be
reversed
because
even
there,
the
court
doubted
very
much
that
this
court
would
want
to
stick
with
some
of
the
broad
language
that
was
contained
in
wirtz
but
they
felt
district
court
judges
shouldn't
overrule
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
i
will
argue
that
the
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standard
act
as
they
apply
to
states
and
cities
and
counties,
which
they
do
encompass
all
of
their
employees
with
minor
exemptions
are
unconstitutional
on
two
basis.
number
one,
i
am
going
to
argue
that
the
nexus
to
commerce
is
so
insubstantial
as
not
to
warrant
the
validity
of
this
act
under
the
commerce
power.
but,
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
certainly,
and
with
great
vigor,
urge
that
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
versus
fry,
which
i
do
not
think
touched
this
case
at
all,
held
that
in
any
case
where
a
federal
statute
impairs
the
ability
of
a
state
or
city
or
county
to
function
in
a
sovereign
capacity,
it
comes
up
against
constitutional
federalism
and
is
invalid.
first
of
all,
let
me
address--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
answer
the
question
right
now
in
this
way.
of
course
cities
and
counties
are
creatures
of
the
state,
they
take
all
of
their
powers
from
the
state,
and
it
is
true
that
one
county
may
perform
50
functions
for
its
cities,
and
one
city
like
chicago
may
perform
5,000
functions
because
of
their
size,
and
that
the
state
may
perform,
say
a
1,000
different
functions
for
the
overall
of
the
citizens.
so,
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment,
it
would
be
my
contention
that
in
the
context
of
this
act,
that
the
states
and
the
cities
and
the
counties
are
one.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
say,
i
am
not
addressing
myself
to
the
eleventh
amendment
in
the
context
of
that
particular
action
that
was
addressed
there,
i
am
talking
about
governmental
functions
that
the
county
performs
for
the
state,
which
i
think
are
entirely
different
basis
from
the
functions
that
were
involved
there.
but
addressing
myself
to
the
nexus
to
commerce,
let
us
look
at
what
the
congress
thought
was
the
nexus
to
commerce.
first
of
all
they
said
there
was
this
famous
95,000
state,
local
and
city
employees
who
received
a
substandard
wage.
from
this
time
i
have
been
in
this
litigation
until
now
i
have
tried
to
find
that
95,000
and
still
trying
to
find
them
and
i
say
that
even
if
they
exist,
where
and
who
are
they
employed
by,
what
county,
what
city,
what
state,
they
all
deny
that
they
have
anyone
who
is
paid
less
than
the
minimum
wage.
but
95,000
out
of
11,400,000
is
a
mighty
small
number,
and
so
i
say
it
is
insignificant
in
the
overall
of
the
picture
so
that
the
substandard
wage
argument
is
no
nexus
to
commerce
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
originated
evidently
in
some
study
done
by
the
labor
department
where
they
made
some
kind
of
a
survey
of
the
nation,
and
they
put
out
these
surveys
every
month.
the
latest
one,
for
example
is
very
interesting
in
connection
with
this
case.
for
example,
it
shows
that
there
are
only
56,000,000
people
for
example,
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
as
compared
to
fry.
and
when
it
comes
to
fry,
i
address
myself
to
that
because
there
are
94,000,000
people,
94,000,000
workers
and
there
are
56
of
those
covered
by
this
act.
and
when
i
mean
covered
that
means
a
record
like
they
have
on
governor
rampton,
not
a
regulation
like
they
have
on
fireman.
but
returning
on
my
argument,
which
i
think
is
very
important,
that
there
is
not
substantial
evidence
here
of
a
nexus
to
commerce
sufficient
on
which
defined
a
rationale
relation
upon
which
to
base
this
act.
the
second,
besides
substandard
wages,
is
labor
strike.
well
let
us
look
at
labor
strike,
they
cited,
they
do
not
say
where
it
is
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
so
again
we
have
to
look
at
the
statistics
in
his
client’s
own
publication.
the
latest
in
1973
says
that
the
three
stoppages
by
public
school
teachers
caused
one-half
of
the
2.3
million
days
of
government
idleness
in
1973.
in
1973,
employees
of
educational
institutions,
or
institutions
both
teachers
and
support
personnel
were
on
strike
more
frequently
than
any
category
of
government
employees.
now
contrast
that,
contrast
that
with
the
very
careful
approach
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
wirtz
case,
where
he
specifically,
specifically
linked
strikes
and
work
stoppages
involving
employees
of
schools
and
hospitals
of
things
that
were
covered
there,
see
here
the
problem
is
you
cover
everybody,
everybody.
and
but
here
mr.
justice
harlan
was
quite
careful
and
i
am
reading
from
392
us
195,
and
he
says
strikes
and
work
stoppages
involving
employees
of
schools
and
hospitals,
events
which
unfortunately
are
not
infrequent,
obviously
interrupt
and
burden
the
flow
of
goods
across
state
lines.
it
is
therefore
clear
that
a
rationale
basis
exists
for
congressional
prescribing
minimum
wage
law.
now,
i
say
there
is
no
finding
here
that
there
was
a
strike
by
anyone
of
these
95,000
ghosted,
impeded,
or
burdened
interstate
commerce
in
any
way.
you
are
talking
about
school
teachers,
and
they
are
exempt?
now,
so
it
goes
then
the
appellee
to
purchasers
and
there
he
is
talking
about
the
minimal
effect
up
to
now,
he
says
all
this
will
have
any
effect
on
state
and
cities,
1%
or
less
something
like
that.
he
balloons
up
and
takes
all
the
purchases
by
all
of
government,
134
billion
dollars.
he
says
that
effects
interstate
commerce
but
he
does
not
show
in
any
way,
as
you
have
found
in
these
other
cases,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
found
in
wirtz,
that
some
of
these
95,000
people
who
were
paid
too
little
were
striking
and
burdening
those
purchases
in
any
way
in
interstate
commerce.
so,
i
say
the
evidence
before
congress
was
nonexistent,
nonexistent.
and
then
he
goes
to
unfair
competition,
what
does
he
have
for
evidence?
he
has
two
ads
in
the
new
york
times,
one
new
york
asks
for
business
to
come
there
because
they
have
low
taxes,
the
other
one
massachusetts
asks
business
to
come
there
because
they
have
low
taxes.
and
from
that,
he
draws
the
conclusion
that
because
they
have
low
taxes
they
pay
sub-minimal
wages.
well,
baloney,
i
just
used
such
a
word
in
this
obvious
body
but
it
is
the
truth,
and
so,
unfair
competition,
the
idea
of
a
state
engaging
in
unfair
competition.
now
you
did
have
competition
in
wirtz
and
it
was
so
found
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
the
thing
that--
and
then
the
next
thing
he
does
is
talks
about
spreading
employment,
well
this
court
does
not
say
this,
one
of
you
once
said
nine-months.
you
realize
what
is
going
on
the
world,
if
there
is
anything
that
is
going
on
in
the
world
it
is
that
people
in
the
public
sector
are
losing
their
jobs
for
the
thousands
every
day.
and
so
here,
where
you
increase
the
pay
of
a
few,
you
caused
the
loss
of
jobs
of
millions,
that
is
exactly
what
this
act
does,
and
it
refers
to
a
less
welfare.
well,
i
cannot
in
my
wildest
imagination
link
that
up
in
anyway.
so
i
come
to
the
conclusion,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
act
is
bottomed
on
a
false
bottom
insofar
as
its
nexus
to
commerce
is
concerned,
and
i
therefore
urge
that
the
act
be
held
unconstitutional
on
that
bill
alone,
but
i
go
again--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
your
honor?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
familiar
with
that
case
and,
your
honor,
they
had
a
lot
more
evidence
there
i
mean
almost
none,
but
here
it
is
so
insubstantial.
and
when
you
look
at
the
entire
nation,
i
say
this,
i
drew
this
from
perez,
and
i
drew
it
from
united
states
versus
bass,
i
think
acquitted
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
idea
that
in
each
case
you
have
required
the
people
before
you
who
assert
you
that
the
interstate
commerce
power
exists
to
show
how.
and
here,
when
you
encompass
the
whole
of
the
united
states
of
america,
the
whole
of
government,
not
only
state
and
local
government
but
all
federal
government,
you
cannot
come
to
grips
with
it
and
i
say
they
have
not
shown
any
nexus
to
commerce,
such
as
has
been
required
by
this
court
over
and
over
again.
now
let
me
go
to
fry,
because
i
think
fry
disposes
this
case.
i
think
that
in
fry
when
this
court
said,
number
one,
words
had
a
small
affect
or
intrusion
on
government
and
fry
had
even
less.
and
then
in
the
footnote,
you
resurrected
from
the
dead,
the
tenth
amendment,
and
said
that
if
the
functions
of
states
and
cities
are
impaired,
are
there
policies
interfered
with
so
as
to
impair
them
that
that
would
violate
constitutional
federalism.
well,
look
at
what
we
have
here,
85%
of
the
budget
of
every
city
in
this
nation
is
personnel,
75%
of
the
budget
of
every
state
is
personnel.
now,
what
you
are
doing
in
this
legislation
is
imposing
down
upon
an
existing
civil
service,
that
obviously,
i
think
clearly
is
satisfying
an
awful
lot
of
people
because
there
was
a
trial
below.
and
the
testimony
in
that
trial
was
that
if
there
were
long
lines
of
people
who
wanted
to
get
police
jobs
and
long
lines
of
people
who
wanted
to
get
fireman’s
job
because
of
the
fringe
benefits
that
go
with
them,
these
are
among
the
most
desirable
of
all
job,
so
was
the
testimony
there.
and
states
and
cities
do
pay
very-very
high,
they
think
wages,
and
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
man
who
earns
$13,000
in
havre
montana
is
a
pretty
high-paid
guy
and
his
$13,000
is
worth
about
$90,000
here.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no
sir,
that
is
not
my
position.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
my
position
is
that
if
there
are,
they
should
pick
them
out
specifically
and
legislate
as
they
did
in
wirtz,
as
they
did
in
wirtz.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
no,
i
would
not
after
reading
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
dissent
in
fry,
in
which
he
approved
california
--
united
states
versus
california
i
would
say
there
is
no
problem.
the
big
problem
here
mr.
justice
white,
is
everybody
is
covered.
the
local
judge
and
his
clerk,
and
the
one
point
that
has
been
made
most
to
me,
i
would
say
and
i
have
a
lot
of
advice,
is
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes
i
did,
and
it
is
this,
and
it
is
a
good
point
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
got
it
from
a
good
source.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
you
are
going
to
here
it
right
now.
it
is
this,
that
the
action
of
a
city
or
a
county
or
state
in
fixing
their
budget,
which
is
their
highest
policy
thing,
is
an
intrastate
act,
it
is
an
intrastate
act.
and
so
you
have
to
show
all
of
this
nexus
to
commerce
in
order
to
cover
that
act,
and
here
congress
in
its
findings
has
totally
failed
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
the
--
what
you
are
doing,
mr.
justice
white,
to
me
who
represents
only
states
and
cities
and
counties
as
you
well
know
is
asking
me
to
tell
some
of
my
clients
what
is
going
to
happen
to
some
of
their
people.
alright,
so
i
will
do
it,
i
would
that
if
they
run
a
railroad--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
alright,
i
would
say
if
there--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
your
honor,
i
would,
accept,
i
would
say
having
lived
my
whole
life
in
trying
to
define
proprietary
and
governmental,
i
have
some
difficulty
with
it.
but
i
would
say
the
railroad,
if
they
run
a
railroad
in
interstate
commerce,
mr.
justice
white,
would
you
accept
that
as
an
illustration
of
employees
that--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
is
very,
very
difficult,
but
i
could
certainly
say
to
you
that
a
policeman
when
he
gives
you
a
ticket
or
when
a
fireman
when
he
puts
out
a
fire--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say,
wirtz
would
fall
within
it,
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
that
i
would
say
to
you
about
wirtz
is
that
since
i
argued
here,
the
first
time
i
went
back
and
read
every
word
of
the
record,
every
word.
and
one
of
the
things
that
impressed
me
there
was
that
the
employees
there
of
hospitals
and
schools
according
to
that
record
with
the
lowest
paid
employees
in
the
whole
united
states
of
america,
these
cafeteria
people
were
getting
85
cents
an
hour,
for
example.
and
so--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
but
i
think
they
should
be
picked
out
especially
and
you
should
not
do
it
on
a
mid-act's
approach.
now
i
think
what
they
have
done
here
is
the
mid-
act''s
approach--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
state
power
company,
no
i
would
not
have
much
trouble
with
that
at
all.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
falls
in
the
category
of
the
railroad,
and
state
lottery,
your
honor,
--
attorney
general
of
maryland
is
back
here
somewhere,
he
ought
to
answer
that
better
than
i.
but
my
point
is
that
when
you
take
the
whole
of
government,
you
are
talking
about,
mr.
justice
white,
i
know
because
i
have
just
--
because
you
people
have
just
forced
me
to
go
through
it
that
the
city
of
richmond
renders
a
161
separate
service
and
they
are
broken
down
into
over
a
thousand,
alright.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
am
saying
that
they
are
so
broad
that
they
are
invalid
on
their
face
completely.
that
if
they
want
to
get
at
a
specific
piece
of
commerce
that
a
city
or
state
are
doing,
let
them
adopt
a
special
law
for
your
power
company--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
find
it
very
difficult,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
white,
to
separate
out
the
different
functions
of
a
city.
now
look,
we
have
50
states,
18,000
cities,
and
3,000
counties,
every
one
of
them
does
something
different.
some
of
them
have
public
power
and
i
think
san
francisco
voted
18
times
not
to
take
over
the
private
power
company.
the
people
vote
and
that
is
another
thing
about
this
whole
thing,
the
solicitor
general
says
it
does
not
interfere
with
policy.
well,
what
is
policy
except
the
spending
of
money
and
the
people
are
voting
down
bond
issues
wholesale
now.
so
here
the
act
is
so
broad,
it
covers
the
all
of
state
and
these
exemptions
made
are
by
grace
only.
so,
i
would
really
urge
that
the
whole
act
is
invalid
under
constitutional
federalism.
if
the
congress
wants
to
come
back
and
pick
out
this
act
and
that
act
which
it
says
is
commerce
and
should
be
regulated
because
it
is
in
competition
with
commerce.
well
let
them
point
it
out
as
they
did
in
wirtz,
as
they
did
in
wirtz,
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out.
and
one
of
the
things
that
he
did
point
out
to
in
that
famous
footnote
27
was,
that
never
would
he
stand
for
a
trivial,
a
trivial
impact
on
interstate
commerce
as
a
basis
for
regulation
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
you
would
have
a
different
constitutional
factual
situation
with
respect
to
who
are
the
95,000,
what
were
they
doing?
were
they
doing
as
the
chief
justice
points
out
a
governmental
function?
or
were
they
engaged
in
commerce
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
that
anytime
that
you
are
dealing
with
policeman,
your
honor,
you
are
dealing
with
one
of
the
two
most
fundamental
services
that
government
renders,
and
i
do
not
think
there
that
the
federal
government
has
any
business
interfering.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
am
really
relying
on
both,
mr.
justice
stevens.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
you
that
there
was
no
evidence,
and
secondly
that
i
was
relying
on
constitutional
federalism
which
in
my
judgment
invalidates
this
act
on
its
face.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
do
not
distinguish,
well,
in
the
fry
case
you
had
an
emergency
and
a
compelling
national
interest,
and
it
covered
the
whole
of
the
nation.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right,
and
i
think
there,
there
was
a
primary
national
concern
that
would
override
under
the
balancing
act
that
this
court
should
do.
the
state
interest
in
tying
to
pay
higher
wages
that
would
interfere
with
a
national
policy
that
had
to
be
affected
because
of
the
emergency.
now,
here
you
have
neither
the
emergency
nor
the
completing
national
interest,
if
anything
you
have
a
compelling
national
interest,
the
other
way
to
uphold
the
elements
of
federalism,
because
it
is
those
elements
of
federalism
that
has
made
this
nation
what
it
is
today.
two-weeks
ago,
i
was
up
in
philadelphia,
and
i
persuaded
a
friendly
policeman
to
allow
me
in
the
old
city
hall
where
chisholm
v.
georgia
and
other
great
cases
were
argued.
and
i
watched
a
film
about
the
cases
and
about
all
the
long
time
that
you
gave
people
in
those
days
to
argue
those
cases
in
the
form
of
days
of
our
country,
and
i
went
over
to
independence
hall,
and
again
with
the
federalist
in
my
hand
thought
a
lot
about
the
beginnings
of
this
country.
and
i
must
say
if
there
is
any
one
thing
that
is
important,
it
is
that
diversity,
that
federalism
has
allowed.
i
have
referred
to
the
facts
that
you
have
got
50
states
and
everyone
of
them
does
most
things
different.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
getting
back
to
fry?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
and
i
would
say
that
it
did
not
help
either
side.
it
did
not
touch
either
one,
that
would
be
my
interpretation
of
it.
but
i
would
say
it
helped
me
in
my
argument
because
it
resurrected
tenth
amendment
and
recognized
the
principle
of
federalism.
and
so
i
think
that,
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
did
help
our
side,
excuse
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
a
distinction--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
a
distinction,
there
have
been
good
many
cases
where
and
you
have
got
them
coming
to
you
now
under
the
environment
protection
act.
there
are
good
many
cases
where
this
court
has
held
that
federal
government
cannot
force
states
to
spend
money
to
carry
out
a
federal
purpose,
so
i
think
that
is
a
distinction,
which
i
had
not
mentioned.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
it
is,
i
think
it
is.
here,
look
what
they
are
doing.
they
are
ordering
states
and
counties
and
cities
to
alter
their
budgets
to
pay
overtime.
and
let
me
just
illustrate
what
this
is
all
about
in
a
way
by
talking
for
just
a
moment
about
california.
california,
i
am
representing
them
also
and
they
want
to
point
it
out
to
you
and
i
do
point
out
to
you,
that
their
firefighting
cost,
under
this
act
will
go
up
from
64
millions
and
94
million.
and
this
is
not
because
they
treat
their
employees
badly,
but
they
treat
them
well.
and
they
also
point
out
that
it
takes
two
years
for
them
to
train
anybody
that
they
are
going
to
cut
down
on
the
overtime
of
the
existing
people,
it
is
going
to
take
them
two
years
and
cost
them
27
million
dollars.
in
california,
they
spend
more
money
on
fire
fighting
as
a
state
than
any
other
state.
and
this
is
an
enormous
change
over,
but
that
big
change
over
is
this.
up
until
now,
most
fireman
and
policeman
paid
on
a
bi-monthly
basis
or
yearly
basis.
under
these
regulations
putout
with
the
sector
labor,
every
thing
is
on
a
28-day
basis,
why
heaven
only
knows?
and
they
have
got
all
kinds
of
regulations.
if
the
man
is
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
his
30-minute
lunch
period,
you
have
to
got
to
give
him
so
much
more
time.
if
he
is
sleeping
and
call
about,
you
have
got
to
keep
all
kinds
of
records.
just
the
record
keeping
alone
in
connection
with
fireman
is
going
to
be
an
enormous
thing
and
shows
the
kind
of
minute
intrusion
that
goes
on
here.
and
those
regulations
which
are
in
the
record,
in
a
particular
provision
that
i
called
your
attention
to
is
on
page
600
because
it
shocks
me
every
time
i
read
it.
it
says
that
the
director
of
the
wage
and
hour
division
is
going
to
fixed
the
work
week.
and
he
is
going
to
fix
the
work
condition.
he
is
going
to
fixed
everything
with
respect
to
police
and
fire.
now,
i
just
do
not
think
that
police
and
fire
departments
has
done
pretty
well
up
to
now,
ought
to
b
e
run
from
washington,
and
if
they
are
run
from
washington,
and
this
act
is
put
into
effect,
you
are
going
to
get,
as
we
point
out
here,
overwhelmingly
less
service
at
a
higher
cost
and
it
is
going
to
mean
that
every
home
order
in
this
nation
will
have
to
pay
higher
fire
rates,
because
your
fire
rates
depend
on
the
amount
of
fire
service
you
have.
the
ramifications
of
this
thing
are
enormous
and
congress
did
not
consider
those
any
more
than
this
thing
that
was
referred
to
about
the
courts.
and
i
will
finish
with
that.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
just
still
your
honor,
agreeing
with
you
saying
one
thing
about
section
16
b,
class
actions.
under
this
act,
you
have
a
right
to
bring
action
on
behalf
of
all
those
similarly
situated,
which
means,
and
then
you
will
get
cost,
you
get
attorneys
fees,
you
get
liquidated
damages,
if
it
is
liquidated
damages
and
you
are
entitled
to
a
time-and-a-half
which
of
course
is
triple
time
and
you
get
the
help
of
the
labor
department
in
carrying
out
your
litigation.
now,
i
was
handed
last
night,
a
reply
brief
by
them
which
i
say
this
is
not
so,
unfortunately
for
them,
the
two
cases
they
cite
do
not
sustain,
they
claim,
you
do
not
have
class
actions
although
it
allows
the
filing
of
the
suits
on
behalf
of
all
those
similarly
situated,
but
because
they
say
it
requires
the
consent
of
all
the
employees.
and
one
of
these
decisions.
it
is
a
fifth
circuit
decisions
that
they
cite
for
you,
it
says
it
is
‘up-in,
up-out.’
it
is
not
a
23
rule
class
action,
but
it
is
still
a
class
action.
and
my
major
point
your
honor
is
that
because
of
all
the
benefits
that
flow
from
16b,
all
this
litigation
from
now
on
is
going
to
be
in
the
federal
court
and
not
in
the
state
courts
and
as
we
pointed
out
time
and
time
again,
and
as
the
city
attorneys
point
out
in
their
briefs,
there
is
no
question,
but
what
one-half
of
all
their
litigation
involves
personal
matter,
so,
talking
about
a
flood
of
litigation
this
would
create.
so,
we
urge
and
we
urge
most
strenuously,
that
this
act
is
invalid
because
they
do
not,
congress
and
its
findings,
does
not
show
any
real
nexus
to
commerce.
and
above
all,
that
under
the
constitutional
federalism,
it
is
invalid
under
the
rules
laid
out
in
fry,
which
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
does
help
us,
because
i
do
think
the
tenth
amendment
now
has
meaning
and
even
be
on
the
tenth
amendment,
because
constitutional
federalism
existed
before
the
tenth
amendment.
i
insist
that
when
you
have
such
a
mammoth,
massive
takeover
of
state
and
local
government
affairs
as
this
act
provides
here.
for
example,
in
their
reply
brief
they
say
that
we
complain,
that
they
might
come
in
and
have
inspections,
and
each
inspection
only
takes
16
hours.
well
now,
imagine
how
many
inspections
new
york
city
with
the
300
and
something
thousand
employees
--
one
inspection
each
or
one
for
the
whole
city?
your
honor,
i
urge
again.
this
act
has
not
been
thought
through.
the
regulations
that
have
promulgated,
they
fit
cities
like
a
square
pig
in
a
round
hole,
they
are
unreasonable,
they
are
invalid,
they
were
issued
six
days
as,
your
honor,
will
recall,
before
christmas
and
could
not
be
even
read
by
cities
or
received
by
them
much
less
considered.
so
we
urge
that
this
act
be
held
invalid
for
the
two
reasons
that
i
have
urged
now.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
true.
but
here
you
have
the
mid-acts
approach
so
you
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about.
you
have
to
fight
them
out
one-by-one
in
the
courts.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
on
maryland
and
wirtz,
on
the
evidence
there
of
the
substandard
wages
and
the
competition
with
the
private
business,
it
is
within
the
area
that
congress
can
reach.
before
when
i
was
here,
i
asked
you
to
set
maryland
versus
wirtz
aside
and
i
think
that
while
it
does
call
some
confusion
in
the
overall
figure
--,
because
of
those
two
facts
i
would
change,
i
say.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
let
me
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
in
the
congress.
they
did
address
their
arguments
to
the
congress
and
they
were
beaten
by
big
labor.
two
secretaries
of
agriculture
testified
that
this
act
was
opposed
the
act
and
one
the
ground
that
it
would
so
overburden
small
government,
really
they
should
have
said
big
government
that
it
was
unwise.
then,
there
was
a
presidential
veto
which
was
upheld
and
then
without
further
hearing,
big
labor
steamed
rolled
(ph)
this
through
the
congress
again.
now
that
is
the
congressional
record
which
cannot
be
challenged.
it
is
the
record
of
this
particular
legislation.
now
i
would
like--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right
your
honor.
now
i
would
like
to
correct
and
it
always
disturbed
me
when
counsel
on
the
other
side,
attacks
figures,
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
one
very
important
thing.
last
night,
i
say,
i
got
very
late,
a
brief
from
the
solicitor
general
in
which
he
comments
a
lot
on
a
brief
that
we
had
filed
and
the
urban
data
service
is
relied
upon
throughout
that
brief.
well
it
so
happens
that
the
urban
data
service
which
i
agree
is
the
most
reliable,
the
most
knowledgeable,
the
best
of
all
sources
of
interest
in
this
country
on
government,
is
the
one
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
made
the
estimate
of
$1
billion
per
year.
now
all
these
other
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
$1
billion
per
year.
now
they
know
what
they
are
taking
about,
they
base
this
on
reports
from
city
managers
and
those
on
the
local
level.
those
people
are
not
liars,
they
report
what
the
facts
are
and
so
i
say
if
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
can
rely
on
the
urban
data
service,
so
can
we.
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
now
secondly,
i
would
like
to
say
there
was
some
question
about
whether
85%
of
the
budgets,
r
&
d
personnel.
now
that
is
a
fact
that
has
appeared,
it
seemed
like
a
thousand
times
in
the
media,
i
find
that
the
first
argument
on
page
38
that
the
solicitor
general
himself
said
as
i
understand
it
in
municipalities,
the
budget
is
80%-85%
wages.
now,
the
whole
business
that
is
so
bothersome
here
is
that
the
policy
of
a
state,
the
policy
of
a
city,
the
policy
of
a
county
is
its
budget.
they
are
like
telephone
books,
it
tells
what
are
you
going
to
do,
who
are
they
going
to
serve,
who
are
they
going
to
hire
what
they
are
going
to
pay
them.
and
what
happens
here
is,
for
that
telephone
book,
we
are
going
to
have
this
telephone
book,
the
federal
regulations
replace
it
and
in
addition
to
this
telephone
book
which
sets
forth
all
the
federal
regulations
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
there
is
an
addition.
the
very
minute
regulations
as
to
police
and
fire,
that
makes
your
report
every
time,
how
long
they
eat,
how
long
they
sleep,
it
is
the
most
intrusive,
the
most
absolute
interference
that
one
can
imagine.
so,
i
would
conclude
that
if
we
want
in
this
200th
year
to
have
a
unitary
government,
okay,
this
is
the
way
we
will
get
it.
i
went
to
the
trouble
of
calling
the
solicitor
of
the
city
of
london
to
ask
him
who
fixed
the
wages
of
his
people
because
i
would
like
to
know.
i
want
to
know
what
parliament
had
to
do
with
it.
he
said,
“well,
in
the
overall
parliament
can
do
it,
but
after
underneath
it,
we
do
it
all.”
now
we
have
checked
in
australia,
we
have
checked
in
new
zealand,
we
have
checked
in
many
other
countries,
there
is
no
county
in
the
world
with
a
national
government,
unless
it
is
unitary,
fixes
the
pay
and
the
wages
of
everybody
the
way
that
is
proposed
here.
and
i
think
that
this
idea
of
federal
regulations
and
the
federal
regulatory
and
federal
courts,
because
you
are
going
to
be
the
final
arbitrar
of
all
of
these
states.
they
point
out
in
these
regulations
that
these
are
merely
suggestive,
that
you
go
to
court
to
get
everything.
and
you
are
going
to
have
class
actions
and
you
are
going
to
have
all
these
cost
and
attorney’s
fees
and
you
are
going
to
have
it
in
the
federal
courts,
because
that
is
the
only
place
you
can
get
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
am
merely
urging
that
this
is
one
of
the
intrusions
into
this
whole
thing
that
states
and
cities
and
counties,
as
the
county
brief
points
that
they
are
not
used
to
dealing
with.
and
why
have
duplicate
regulation
on
top
of
regulation
--
that
is
what
you
have
here.
and
we
have
a
complete
system
now
and
when
you
dump
all
of
the
federal
regulation
on
top
of
it,
it
will
simply
make
states
and
cities
fiscal
integrity
a
question,
not
only
in
some
of
our
larger
cities
but
in
our
smaller
cities
as
well.
they
are
on
the
borderline
now.
they
can
not
take
the
cost
of
this
legislation.
