justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
you
made
any
arguments
that
were
made
in
maryland
against
wirtz?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
leave
maryland
against
wirtz
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
we
must
overrule
maryland
against
wirtz?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
hold
for
you
must
be
overruled
maryland
against
wirtz?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
supposed
you
did
think
of
a
lot
of
cases
in
the
books
that
you
think
about
to
be
overruled,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
you're
thinking
of
this
one,
but
why
is
it
involved
in
this
case,
maryland
against
wirtz?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
think
we
should
overrule
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
it
involved
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
speak
for
yourself.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
about
well
made
if
the
state
policy
has
no
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
happen
to
know
governor,
do
most
of
the
state
have
laws
prohibiting
strikes
by
public
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
happen
to
read
the
schedule?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
your
position
that
just
as
a
matter
of
commerce
power
the
federal
government
cannot
reach
these
activities
of
the
states,
or
is
it
that
of
course,
it
is
within
the
commerce
power
but
the
commerce
power
is
limited
by
some
other
considerations--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
little
bit
different
point,
it
is
a
sense
of,
there
is
some
limitations
and
consideration
that
federalism
put
on
the
reach
of
the
commerce
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
if
some
private
industry
was
performing
--
let
us
assume
the
states
decided
to
form
out
its
police
job
and
have
some
independent
contractors
performing.
would
you
suggest
that
the
power
would
not
reach
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
rhyne,
is
it
your
position
that
there
are
no
state
employees
that
are
actually
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
those
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
conceive
there
would
be
any
problem
about
that
would
suspect
to
the
federal
power,
the
constitutionality
of
law
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did,
but
you
just
got
some
orders.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
am
going
to
here
it
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
to
me
some
test
that
would
be
satisfactory
to
you
to
sort
out
one
of
the
groups
--
the
employees
of
the
state
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
may
properly
reach
in
those
that
it
may
not
reach?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
how
far
your
position
goes.
justice
byron
r.
white
--illustrations,
but
i
do
not
want
to
pursue
it,
i
thought
maybe
you
had
some
formulation
in
mind
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
depend
upon
the
overrule
though.
justice
byron
r.
