brief.
justice
potter
stewart
by
of
april
12?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
on
page
9
down
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
i'm
reading
three
sentences
from
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
the
civil
service
commission
who
spoke
of
how
complex
this
act
when
it's
imposed
down
upon
the
civil
service
system
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
how
it
imposes
double
standards,
double
bookkeeping,
double
work
for
negligible
benefits.
now,
it's
even
worst
for
states
and
cities
because
while
the
congress
gave
this
regulatory
power
to
the
civil
service
commission
so
that
disruption
could
be
avoided.
just
think
of
what
it's
doing
to
the
states
and
cities,
we
were
all
placed
in
with
commercial
enterprises
before
the
secretary
of
labor.
we
have
in
the
act
and
in
its
application
in
this
power
shift,
so
many
instances
similar
to
the
one
i
cited
in
the
new
jersey
where
the
existing
law
of
states
is
wiped
out,
where
the
existing
processes,
procedures
and
such
with
respect
to
employee
rights
is
wiped
out.
now,
another
thing
this
act
does,
it
brings
a
whole
new
set
of
definitions
of
overtime
of
who
is
an
expert.
there
are
51
pages
in
the
code
of
federal
regulation
about
who
about
what
overtime
is.
there
are
42
pages
defining
who
is
an
exempt
person.
now,
the
civil
service
commission
that
we
quoted
in
our
brief
said
they're
going
to
define
themselves
who
is
an
exempt
person.
but
my
major
point
is
that
there
is
such
a
vast
shift
in
power
to
say
what
overtime
shall
be,
just
say
who
shall
be
exempt.
all
these
kind
of
things
when
you
impose
those
down
on
the
area
where
states
and
the
cities
spend
the
majority
of
their
money,
where
they
have
developed
all
these
rules
and
regulations
as
in
new
jersey
for
years
and
years,
and
their
people
have
voted
them
in
or
voted
them
out
and
that's
all
gone
now.
you're
going
to
have
it
imposed
from
on
high
by
the
secretary
of
labor
or
by
the
congress.
the
big
impact
in
one
area
i
think
is
most
dramatic
and
that
is
in
the
area
of
voluntarism.
in
the
united
states
of
america,
in
government
areas,
we
depend
more
on
volunteers
than
any
other
system
of
government
in
the
world.
and
if
the
local
level,
we
have
volunteer
fireman,
we
have
volunteer
police,
we
have
volunteer
of
this
and
volunteer
of
that,
there
are
millions
of
them.
now,
this
act
when
it
was
written,
it
defined
employ
as
to
suffer
our
permit
to
work.
now,
that's
all
right
insofar
as
private
industries
are
concerned
because
they
don't
have
this
volunteer
problem.
but
look
at
the
states
and
cities
who
sometimes
pay
a
volunteer
fireman
$2.50
to
go
on
each
fire,
look
at
the
situation
that
exist
where
they
sometimes
give
the
volunteer
policeman
uniforms
and
they
sometimes
pay
insurance
on
them.
now,
the
only
answer
to
that
appellee
is
well,
you
just
have
to
take
it
case
by
case
as
to
where.
a
volunteer
crosses
over
the
line
from
being
a
volunteer
to
being
an
employer
or
employee.
and
so,
that
creates
this
consternation
all
across
our
nation
and
in
other
area,
it's
going
to
be
very,
very
damaging.
at
the
local
level,
we
use
thousands
of
interns.
now
frankly,
the
interns
are
not
worth
that
much
to
local
government,
it's
more
of
a
favor
to
the
intern
to
bring
then
in
then
it
--
to
a
really
a
benefit
for
a
state
or
city.
but
now,
they
are
going
to
have
to
be
paid
if
certain
things
occur
because
of
the
interns
have
to
leave
and
you
pay
him
a
little
bit,
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
him
a
lot.
but
there's
another
area
where
this
whole
thing
really
hurts.
many
of
the
volunteer
firemen,
as
the
record
showed,
many
of
the
volunteer
policemen
are
already,
let's
say
a
city
engineer
or
schoolteacher.
now,
if
they
go
out
as
a
volunteer
on
a
fire
or
for
some
as
a
policeman
and
they
worked
in
addition
to
their
40
hours
as
an
engineer
or
schoolteacher,
a
few
more
hours
and
they
are
rule
to
be
an
employee
during
their
volunteer
time
because
they
receive
some
minor
compensation.
well,
the
act
says
that
you've
got
to
pay
them
time
and
a
--
over
--
time
and
a
half
for
overtime
at
their
same
rate
of
pay.
their
may
be
a
highly
paid
engineer
getting
$25,000.00
a
year
and
when
you
look
at
paying
him
overtime
for
his
volunteer
firework
or
as
volunteer
police,
you
just
mess
up
the
structure
of
voluntarism
throughout
our
nation.
i
don't
think
there's
ever
been
anything
that
has
so
cost,
confusion,
and
this
massive
confusion
was
referred
to
by
mr.
alan
prichard,
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
league
of
cities
in
the
record
here
saying
that,
“no
one
could
really
tell
where
you
are
and
where
you're
going
because
you
have
all
of
these
complex
regulations
imposed
suddenly
down
on
already
complex,
already
regulatory
regulations
of
the
status
and
tenure
of
city
employees.”
but,
perhaps,
one
of
the
most
devastating
fears
of
states
and
cities
is
that
this
act
creates
class
actions.
now,
you
don't
have
class
action
against
cities
under
their
current
set
up
but
they
do
have
fair
hearings,
they
do
have
court
cases,
and
as
we
point
out
giving
any
time,
the
one-third
of
all
litigation
before
state
courts
is
really
involving
personnel
matters.
so
here,
you
have
this
act
saying
that
you
can
either
--
the
appellee
or
an
employee
can
bring
a
class
action.
his
attorney
gets
attorney's
fees,
it
gets
cost,
and
you
get
double
time,
triple
time
if
you
win.
now,
from
a
state
in
determining
whether
a
man
has
crossed
that
line
as
a
volunteer,
from
a
state
is
to
whether
the
intern
gets
too
much,
the
damage
is
enormous
because
they
can
make
a
mistake
of
fact
or
law.
in
a
city
like
new
york,
it
cannot
run
up
to
enormous,
enormous
cost.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
talk
about
what
the
congress
could
do,
it
really
brings
you
back
to
the
conventional
test
and
constitutional
adjudication
of
any
enactment
of
the
congress
to
united
states.
inquiry
one,
always
is,
is
this
enactment
within
the
express
or
implied
powers
of
congress
conferred
upon
it
by
the
constitution
of
united
states.
that's
your
first
inquiry
when
you
talk
about,
could
the
congress
do
this
and
you
spent
briefly,
the
first
part
of
your
argument
saying
yes
so
far
as
the
commerce
power
goes.
yes,
it
can,
the
congress
could
do
this.
the
second
inquiry
always
in
the
conventional
procedure
of
constitutional
adjudication
when
what's
involve
is
the
validity
of
an
act
of
congress
is,
even
if
within
the
power,
does
it
run
into
some
other
prohibition
or
impediment
contained
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
be
that
impediment
or
prohibition
in
the
bill
of
rights
or
in
some
other
provision,
explicit
or
implicit
in
the
constitution.
so
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
said
that
it
could
then
i
suppose
it
certainly
could
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
question
is,
could
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
some
other
impediment
in
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
something
may
well
be
clearly
within
the
commerce
power
but
also
a
clear
violation
for
example
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
say
you
gather
you
concede
that
there
is
a
point
with
any
similar
legislation
where
that
impediment
or
prohibition
would
make
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
even
though
within
its
commerce
power.
justice
potter
stewart
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
if
colley
is
in
the
other
examples
you've
given
us,
the
state
often
just
--
isn't
aware
of
the
threat
or
even
relaxes
and
enjoys
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
we
don't
get
the
argument
from
the
states.
we
get
it
from
the
private
individuals.
i'm
thinking
about
the
things
such
as
the
validity
of
the
federal
anti
loan
sharking
law
which
was
upheld
to
this
court
with
only
one
dissent
or
the
federal
relations
act
for
another
example.
the
states
don't
see
their
interest
affected
and
you're
telling
us
that
they're
more
gravely
affected
by
that
kind
sort
of
legislation.
then
by
this,
the
state
sees
the
threat
and
therefore,
we
get
the
argument
in
these
cases.
and
an
adversary
system
perhaps,
we
don't
fully
consider
the
argument
or
apprehended
in
the
other
cases
in
which
you've
already
told
us,
you
see
a
greater
threat
to
federalism.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
an
adversary
system
of
justice,
you
have
to
have
adversaries
and
in
those
other
cases,
the
state
has
not
been
an
adversary.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
a
–
it's
a
nice
rhetorical
phrase
substandard
wages,
but
it
means
more
than
that,
it
means
technically
that
every
hour
work
over
40
hours
a
week
is
time
and
a
half.
and
maybe
an
employer
wants
to
say,
“well,
i
want
you
to
have
a
regular
week
of
50
hours
because
of
a
particular
need
of
this
municipality
or
this
particular
public
service
and
not
be
bothered
with
computing
overtime.
and
that
may
or
may
not
be
substandard
in
the
ordinary
economic
sense
to
worry,
you
maybe
getting
higher
wages,
but
all
these
nonsense
with
the
federal
bureaucratic
red
tape
when
he
is
running
his
municipal
government.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
s
rhetorical
phase
that
involves
--
it
could
many
rather
technical
rules
and
regulations.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
was
the
point
as
i
understood
of
my
brother
rehnquist
question,
that's
the
question
here,
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
is
impeded
by
the
structure
of
the
constitution
from
exerting
the
power
to
change
the
ways
as
the
municipalities
will
and
the
states
want
to
do
their
business
with
respect
to
their
employees
(voice
overlap)
in
a
substandard
wages.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
evident
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
may
i
ask,
why
would
you
have
constitutional
difficulties
with
my
brother
stevens
example
of
limiting
of
an
active
congress
limiting
the
salary
of
all
state
judges
and
the
maximum
pay
to
the
federal
judges?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
not
understand
that,
why,
when
they
go
back
do
you
have
any
doubt
at
all
about
the
power
of
congress
to
limit
the
salaries
of
the
state
judges.
