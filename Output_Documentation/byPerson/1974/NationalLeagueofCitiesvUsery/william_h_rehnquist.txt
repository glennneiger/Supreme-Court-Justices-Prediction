justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rhyne.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
supposed
that
darby
lumber
company
probably
made
most
of
the
arguments
you're
making
now
when
it
sought
to
challenge
the
exercise
of
congress
under
their
commerce
for
passing
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
applicable
or
private
business.
certainly,
private
business
is
when
if
the
act
went
into
effect
in
1938
had
to
make
very,
very
significant
changes.
i
take
it
--
your
point
is
that
not
only
other
changes
but
that
this
is
somewhat
different
than
just
the
congress
imposing
regulation
on
a
private
business.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
employees
are
covered
by
these
amendments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
how
many
are
those?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
ones
that
exempt
from
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
most
favorable
to
the
government;
that
is
the
most
limited
number
of
people
who
are
actually
affected
by
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
provisions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
briefly,
if
less
than
half
are
covered,
that
could
still
be
what,
four
or
five
million?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
wouldn't
call
that
de
minimus.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
jones
about
a
generation
ago,
the
state
of
california
was
back
here
saying
it
was
none
of
the
federal
government's
business
how
it
run
the
beltline
railway.
and,
this
court
in
the
anonymous
opinion
give
fairly
short
shrift
to
its
argument
said
that
if
congress
wanted
to
exercise
the
commerce's
power
that
was
congresses
prerogative.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
kind
of
reasons
you
have
giving
now
are
equally
applicable
to
a
private
business.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
earlier
argument
to
the
chief
justice
as
i
understood
it
was
that
this
law
has
no
effect
on
state
policy
choices.
now,
you're
in
the
effect
saying
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
is
to
be
precluded
from
the
sort
of
thing
that
massachusetts
is
doing.
it's
not
to
promote
tourism
at
the
expense
of
employees'
salary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
conceive
then
that
congress
does
not
have
the
same
freedom
under
the
commerce
power
to
regulate
activities
of
states
and
cities
as
it
does
those
have
private
businesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
affirm
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
could
we
make
a
principle
distinction
if
we
uphold
this
law
and
the
case
posited
by
the
chief
justice
then
does
by
some
perhaps
fluke
of
the
political
system
come
to
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
i
agree
with
you
on
that
point
general
bork.
under
the
supremacy
clause,
if
you're
talking
about
federal
regulation
of
a
universe
of
private
individuals
versus
state
regulation
of
the
universe
of
private
individuals,
certainly,
the
implication
or
not
just
implication
but
the
provision.
the
constitution
says,
if
the
federal
government
acts
within
its
delegated
authority,
the
commerce
clause,
it
shall
be
supreme.
but
i
don't
regard
those
preemption
cases
as
being
necessarily
a
guide
to
the
situation
where
congress
seeks
to
work
its
will,
not
just
on
private
individuals
or
businesses
that
have
not
been
in
a
state
but
on
the
state
itself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right,
then
you're
wrong
in
conceding
that
there
is
any
federalism
limitation
on
the
commerce
part
because
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
or
that
it's
simply
a
private
business
challenging
congresses'
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause
without
asserting
any
affirmative
constitutional
defense
of
his
own,
the
power
of
congress
is
plenary
and
there
is
no
limitation
or
whatever.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
long
as
it
was
able
to
tie
it
the
commerce
clause
and
do
certainly
read
a
lot
of
congressional
legislation
has
gone
far
to
supersede
otherwise
valid
state
legislation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
a
private
individual
could
assert
that
to
the
same
extent
that
a
state
could?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
many
of
those
cases
where
the
commerce
clause
legislation
was
upheld,
the
states
were
happy
to
have
it
upheld
because
there
had
been
a
no
man's
land
before.
the
states
couldn't
regulate
because
it
was
interstate
commerce
and
the
federal
government
couldn't
regulate
because
there
was
some
defect
in
congressional
authority.
so
your
case
is
in
the
30's
that
uphold
commerce
regulation
by
congress
that
was
basically
the
full
approval
of
the
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
subject
to
inspection
the
way
private
employer's
records
of
wages
and
hours
paid
and
kept
are?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
presumably,
though
congress,
if
it
were
to
enact
the
entire
local
code
for
the
states,
which
you
say
even
you
would
draw
back
at
in
each
case
would
be
saying,
surely
states
sovereignty
doesn't
depend
on
denying
the
beneficent
purpose
of
congress
had
in
mind
with
the
statute,
that
the
real
complaint
is
that
the
states
have
lost
the
power
to
determine
this
matter
for
themselves,
isn't
it
rather
than
that
they've
lost
the
power
to
pay
substandard
wages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
statute
that
required
all
states
and
local
government
to
bargain
collectively
with
their
employees
as
in
matter
of
wages
and
hours,
you
have
exactly
the
same
arguments
available
to
you.
wouldn't
you
that
this
large
segment
of
employee
shouldn't
be
exempt
from
standards
that
were
imposed
by
private
employers?
would
that
raise
any
more
difficult
constitutional
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rhyne--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sometime
during
your
argument,
will
you
address
yourself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
states
are
necessarily
in
the
same
position
as
the
counties
and
the
cities
here.
because
as
i
see
it
there
are
two
lines
of
authority,
a
county
or
a
city
acting
is
state
action
for
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
a
county
is
not
a
state
for
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
so
i
can
conceive
of
there
being
some
distinction
made
even
if
your
argument
were
accepted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
are
relying
on
the
eleventh
amendment,
i
think
the
law
is
rather
clearly
against
you,
because
as
justice
marshal’s
opinion
in
moore
against
alameda
county
just
two
or
three
years
ago,
reaffirmed
the
old
holding
of
this
court
that
a
county
was
not
a
state
for
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
about
cases
like
jones
and
laughlin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
not
recognized
any
distinction
between
federal
government
exercising
commerce
authority
over
a
private
business
and
thereby
displacing
the
state’s
legislative
authority
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
over
that
business
and
the
federal
government
exercising
commerce
power
over
the
state
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any
doubt
from
our
decisions,
in
the
cases
like
perez,
that
the
federal
government
pretty
well
can
take
over
all
the
policies
in
the,
so
insofar
as
regulations
of
private
individuals
is
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
decision
that
justice
frankfurter
took
in
new
york
against
united
states
and
i
think
that
majority
of
the
court
felt
that
something
more
was
required
and
just
delayed
laying
down
a
no
discrimination
rule
in
order
to
protect
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
does
it
work
here
and
not
say
in
the
case
where
you
make
the
state
subject
to
the
taft-hartley
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
same
argument
could
be
used
to
say,
“well,
now
we
come
to
the
question
of
collective
bargaining
and
so
forth,”
and
why
not
say,
“it
is
alright,
just
long
as
congress
discriminates
in
treating
of
states
no
differently
that
does
a
private
employer,”
how
could
you
distinguish
that
case
from
this
under
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
rhyne
suggest,
rightly
or
wrongly,
i
do
not
know,
that
what
is
a
higher
policy
making
a
function
to
state
in
determining
its
budgetary
priorities
and
determining
who
is
going
to
get
how
much
in
the
way
of
wages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
being
required
here
to
give
up
absolutely
one
policy
and
that
is
your
policy
of
paying
these
particular
workers
a
particular
amount
set
by
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
make
policy,
general--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
get
the
different
result
for
the
setting
of
a
maximum
ceiling
on
a
corporation
executive
by
congress
in
the
setting
of
a
salary
on
judges
if
darby
and
wirtz
are
the
same.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
national
league
of
cities
against
usery,
the
case
arises
out
of
suits
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
by
appellants
national
league
of
cities
and
towns,
the
state
of
california
and
individual
cities
and
towns
against
respondent
secretary
of
labor.
appellants
sought
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
parts
of
the
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
district
court
denied
them
relief.
we
heard
the
case
argued
last
term
and
reargued
this
term.
the
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
congress
may,
in
enacting
minimum
wage
legislation,
treated
the
states
and
their
political
subdivisions,
as
if
there
were
no
different
from
a
private
employer.
the
original
fair
labor
standards
act
was
enacted
in
1938.
its
essential
thrust
was
to
require
employees
or
employers,
producing
goods
for
commerce,
to
pay
their
employees
a
stipulated
minimum
hourly
wage,
and
to
require
those
employers
to
pay
their
employees
time-and-a-half
for
hours
worked
in
access
of
40
per
week.
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
darby
decided
in
1941,
this
court
upheld
the
act
as
well
within
the
power
of
commerce,
of
congress
under
its
commerce
clause
authority.
subsequent
amendments
have
broaden
the
coverage
of
the
act
to
more
employees
and
have
been
increased
the
stipulated
minimum
wage.
but
until
1961,
the
act
have
expressly
excluded
form
its
definition
of
employers
states,
cities,
and
similar
bodies.
even
though
these
entities
obviously
represented
a
large
and
growing
portion
of
the
nation’s
employers.
in
1961,
congress
amended
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
bring
within
its
coverage
public
employees
whose
work
was
in
hospitals,
schools,
and
similar
institutions.
the
state
challenge
these
1961
amendments
on
constitutional
grounds,
which,
for
the
first
time,
included
them
as
employers
for
purposes
of
the
act.
but
in
the
case
of
maryland
against
wirtz,
decided
in
1967,
this
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
1961
amendments.
by
the
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
are
attacked
in
the
case
now
before
us,
congress
sought
to
expand
what
had
been
merely
a
beachhead
under
the
1961
amendments,
into
an
across
the
board
statutory
directive
to
state
and
local
governments,
requiring
them
to
pay
a
stipulated
minimum
wage
to
their
employees
and
to
pay
those
employees
time-and-a-half
for
overtime.
the
district
court
in
this
case,
although
it
denied
relief
to
the
appellants,
observed
that
upon
further
consideration
this
court
might
wish
to
retreat
from
some
of
what
it
described
as
the
far
reaching
implications
of
the
decision
in
maryland
against
wirtz,
but
that
court
quite
properly
recognized
that
only
this
court
could
authorize
such
a
retreat.
we
have
found
this
to
be
a
very
difficult
case,
no
less
difficult
after
reargument
than
after
the
first
argument.
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
the
principles
on
which
maryland
against
wirtz
was
decided
control
this
case,
even
though
they
two
are
factually
distinguishable.
after
mature
and
careful
consideration,
as
we
are
capable
of
giving
the
matter,
we
have
decided
that
maryland
against
wirtz
was
wrongly
decided,
and
we
now
overrule
it.
we
hold
that
congress
is
prohibited
by
traditional
principles
of
inter-governmental
immunity
embodied
in
the
constitution
from
using
its
commerce
power
to
impose
minimum
wage
and
maximum
hour
requirements
on
employees
of
state
and
local
governments
who
were
engaged
in
the
carrying
out
of
integral
government
functions
or
the
furnishing
of
traditional
governmental
services.
we
accordingly,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remand
the
case
to
it
for
further
proceedings
and
conformity
with
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion;
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined;
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
