mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
participating
in
the
argument,
re-argument
of
this
case
today,
even
though
i
did
not
participate
in
the
first
argument.
not
in
the
hope
that
i
can
add
any
legal
expertise
to
our
chief
council
mr.
rhyne
but
because
my
fellow
governors
of
the
50
states
desire
that
i
express
their
deep
concern
for
this
court,
in
regard
to
the
fair
labor
standard
act
amendments
of
1974,
concern
not
only
for
the
immediate
effect
that
will
have
on
the
operation
of
state
and
local
government,
but
also
on
the
fact
that
we
feel
this
is
another
step
forward
toward
wiping
out
state
sovereignty
and
perhaps
a
near
retrievable
step.
in
this
case,
there
appears
to
be
a
great
deal
of
argument
of
fact
based
upon
no
evidence,
because
of
course
the
case
though
it
no
evidence
presented
below,
and
yet
there
have
been
assertions
made
by
brief
on
both
sides
as
to
the
effect
of
the
act.
the
solicitor
general
asserts
that
as
a
basis
for
the
need
for
congress
to
extend
the
provision
to
the
fair
labor
act
to
state
and
local
government,
that
there
were
some
95,000
employees
in
the
united
states,
state
and
local
government
that
were
being
payed
less
than
the
minimum
wage.
the
same
token
i
will
say
i
doubt
very
much
that
that
is
so,
i
have
done
survey
in
my
own
state,
and
there
are
none.
also,
the
appellants
have
made
certain
allegations
regarding
the
cost
of
the
application
of
these
rules
to
state
and
local
government.
here
again,
i
doubt
if
we
were
in
a
trial
court
that
the
evidence
would
stand
out.
but
this
much
i
think
must
be
true
and
it
appears
to
me
that
the
solicitor
general
is
in
sort
of
in
a
dilemma’
here.
on
the
one
hand,
he
alleges
that
there
is
a
great
problem
to
cure
the
95,000
people
that
are
below
minimum
wage
and
on
the
other
hand,
that
he
is
not
going
to
put
a
burden
on
state
and
local
government
to
cure
it.
as
whatever
the
problem
is,
it
is
a
problem
that
has
got
to
be
cured
by
money,
and
the
cost
of
the
cure
is
going
to
be
commensurate
with
the
size
of
the
problem.
and
if
it
is
a
big
problem,
as
he
attempts
to
assert
as
indeed
he
must,
if
he
is
to
prevail
here,
if
there
is
a
big
problem
then
the
money
required
from
state
and
local
government
committed
is
indeed
going
to
put
a
burden
on
the
budgets
of
those
units
of
government.
most
of
the
states
provide
for
over
time
for
their
employees
up
to
a
certain
level,
generally
above
a
given
salary
level
or
a
given
salary
classification
in
the
pay
scale
and
provides
for
compensatory
time-off.
however,
in
my
opinion
it
would
not
be
difficult
in
regard
to
apportion
of
state
government
to
change
to
comply
with
these
rules,
to
pay
the
time
and
half
or
overtime,
because
you
could
then
do
as
many
governors
have
said,
“alright
we
will
do
this
but
from
now
on
there
will
be
no
overtime.”
over
in
regard
to
a
certain
classification
of
employees,
those
engaged
in
public
safety,
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
conform
to
an
eight-hour
day
or
a
forty-hour
week.
and
if
they
are
to
perform
the
functions,
which
is
their
duty
to
perform,
even
though
the
act
and
the
regulations
under
the
act,
make
some
modification
to
the
requirements
to
fireman
and
policeman,
they
cannot
and
should
not
be
met.
congress
has
not
attempted
to
bring
the
armed
services,
that
is
the
military
personnel
except
for
civilian
employees
under
the
provisions
of
these
acts
and
yet
there
is
not
a
fire
department,
a
police
department,
or
a
highway
patrol
in
this
country
that
does
not
have
to
operate
fairly
well
under
military
rules,
and
where
there
is
an
emergency
in
the
forty-hour
week
or
the
fifty-seven
hour
week,
rings
the
bell
on
you,
but
they
cannot
quit
and
go
home,
do
the
job.
so
it
is
not
within
the
power
of
the
state
governments
to
comply
in
full
and
avoid
the
impact
of
these
new
orders.
the
forty-hour
week
will,
in
my
opinion,
bear
much
more
heavily
on
cities
and
counties
than
it
will
on
state
governments.
but
all
of
the
governors
feel
a
responsibility
to
the
subsidiary
units
of
governments
within
their
states
because
they
are
creatures
of
the
state
legislature;
the
legislature
has
got
to
give
them
the
power
and
authority
to
render
the
services
that
they
are
charged
with
rendering.
so
as
a
governor,
i
feel
equally
responsible
for
units
of
local
government
and
their
budgets
and
their
ability
to
render
the
services
i
do
for
the
state
government
itself.
in
most
states
and
in
most
larger
cities,
the
supervision
of
employee-relationship
is
under
a
merit
system
council.
by
this
provision,
these
amendments,
the
merit
system
council
for
state
and
local
government
would
be
first,
the
department
of
labor
and
secondly,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
you
are
mentioning
this
morning
the
425
federal
courts
in
this
country.
already
these
courts
are
overloaded,
and
new
judges
are
necessary,
and
here
is
a
knack
which
would
throw
a
new
burden
on
them,
a
much
greater
burden
than
was
thrown
on
them
by
wirtz.
because
in
the
case
of
wirtz,
we
were
able
to
--
or
the
cities
and
counties
and
the
states
were
able
to
adjust
reasonably
well
so
that
most
of
the
cases
that
had
gone
into
a
federal
courts,
pursuant
to
the
wirtz
case,
were
violations
that
occurred
while
wirtz
was
pending.
but
in
this
case,
under
the
1974
amendments
as
i
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago,
because
you
extend
so
much
further
and
because
you
cannot
conceivably
comply
because
of
emergency
situations,
the
amount
of
litigation
will
be
truly
great.
the
local
merit
system
councils
have
been
able
through
their
acquaintanceship
with
local
problems
to
keep
labor
disturbances
within
the
states
and
cities
and
counties
to
a
minimum.
and
there
is
no
danger
here,
contrary
to
what
the
congress
found
that
strikes,
which
might
be
prevented
by
payment
of
the
minimum
wage,
are
going
to
place
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
however,
the
greatest
fear
i
believe
that
i
and
my
colleagues
have,
regarding
these
1974
amendments--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
there
are
very
few
that
permit
them,
many
are
silent
on
them,
some
have
them,
i
could
get
a
schedule
of
that
and
file
it
as
a
late
brief
but--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
but
in
those
states
which
do
not
specifically
permit
strikes
by
public
employees,
the
governors
have
taken
the
same
position
that
was
taken
in
1924
by
governor
coolidge
of
massachusetts,
that
you
cannot
strike
against
the
public
welfare.
we
believe
that
this
case
takes
us
a
great
deal
further
than
wirtz
does,
while
i
do
not
agree
with
wirtz,
i
feel
it
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
case.
in
the
wirtz
case,
you
can
base
the
jurisdiction
solely
on
the
competition
theory
because
the
activities
of
government
which
were
there
covered
by
the
early
amendments,
all
can
conceivably
be
said
to
be
in
direct
competition
with
firms
in
interstate
commerce,
not
so
under
the
’74
amendments.
you
can
uphold
the
’74
amendments
and
say,
that
the
activities
there
covered
are
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
only
by
the
application
of
the
enterprise
theory.
i
know
you
did
discuss
the
enterprise
theory
in
wirtz
and
cite
that
that
as
one
basis
that
the
holding
in
wirtz,
but
it
is
not
necessary
in
the
holding
in
wirtz
and
that
could
be
changed
without
overturning
wirtz.
but
if
the
enterprise
theory
actually
is
to
apply
to
states
and
local
governments
and
go
to
its
logical
conclusion,
then
i
think
you
have
destroyed
the
sovereignty
of
states--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
commerce
power
is
limited,
it
is
my
position,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
attempt
to
apply
the
enterprise
theory
to
local
and
state
governments,
is
always
applied
to
private
concerns,
but
to
attempt
to
apply
it
to
local
and
state
governments
which
would
then
bring
under
the
commerce
clause
every
single
act
that
local
and
state
government
might
make
would
effectively
wipe-out
the
sovereignty
of
states.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes,
certainly,
i
would
have
said
that
that
is
true.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
would
suggest
that
no
state
would
do
that,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
difference
is,
to
use
the
words
of
chief
justice
burger
when
we
argued
this
the
last
time,
the
things
reached
by
wirtz
are
activities
that
a
state
may
do
or
may
not
do,
i
guess
another
way
of
saying
these
things
that
they
do
in
their
proprietary
capacity.
the
things
that
are
now
reached
under
the
1974
amendments
are
things
that
they
must
do
if
they
are
going
to
continue
with
the
state,
if
they
are
going
to
continue
to
exercise
the
state
police
power,
and
therefore
not
only
in
terms
of
the
people
covered
but
in
terms
of
the
principle
a
giant
step
beyond
wirtz.
and
from
that
step
i
can
see
no
logical
stopping
point.
right
now
there
is
pending
before
the
congress,
bills
that
would
extend
to
all
provisions
for
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
state,
including
the
right
requirements
for
negotiation,
the
requirement
that
locally
officials
--
locally
elected
officials
submit
to
binding
arbitration
and
giving
employees
the
right
strike
and
that
was
build
or
held
up
there
only
because
of
dependency
of
this
case.
again,
i
repeat
that
i
and
my
fellow
governors
are
concerned
not
only
with
the
immediate
effects
of
the
1974
amendments
or
with
the
fact
that
it
strikes
down
the
last
bar
that
prevents
the
intrusion
of
congress
on
the
power
of
the
states.
