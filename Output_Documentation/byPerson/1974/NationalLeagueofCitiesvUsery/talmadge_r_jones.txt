mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
bring
to
the
court
what
must
surely
be
a
simple
and
true
proposition
but
which
is
nevertheless
escape
the
attention
of
our
distinguish
congress;
namely
that
the
states
are
governments
not
commercial
enterprises.
we
examine
today
the
constitutionality
of
the
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
an
effort
to
convert
the
states
into
enterprises
and
thereby
regulate
and
control
the
minimum
wages
in
the
maximum
hours
of
their
respective
employees.
i
wish
to
briefly
outline
the
an
foreseen
consequences
of
the
amendments
on
the
california
civil
service
system
and
then
time
permitting
and
if
really
necessary
to
point
out
the
unconstitutional
dimension
of
this
unprecedented
intrusion
into
the
severance
sphere
of
state
government
in
the
name
of
commerce.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
a
purely
governmental
function
of
state
government
namely
fire-suppression;
certainly,
that
is
unique
to
the
states
in
the
cities
in
the
counties.
i
think
our
brief
is
out
of
what
we
pointed
out
the
physical
impact,
but
let
me
give
you
a
few
statistics
and
show
you
why
a
fireman
is
not
a
fireman.
california
does
not
operate
a
norman
rockwell
type
fire
department
with
the
friendly
dalmatian
sitting
in
front
of
the
station
house.
we're
700
mile
in
length
and
we
have
61
million
acres
of
force
that
we
protect
out
there,
you
could
squeeze
in
eight
of
the
north
eastern
states
into
the
state
of
california
and
still
have
room
left
over.
we
have
more
wide
land
undeveloped
acreage
then
the
library
of
congress
has
books.
its
rugged
topography,
it
takes
you
three
hours
to
get
to
a
fire
many
times,
sometimes
you
have
to
come
in
by
parachute.
40%
of
the
united
states
force
service
budgets
is
spend
in
the
state
to
california
in
18
national
force.
and
when
we
have
fires
we
have
fires,
we
don't
extinguish
fires;
we
have
wars
against
fires.
they
last
for
weeks.
in
1970,
we
lost
over
500,000
acres.
at
one
point
in
one
single
period
in
a
13-day
period
at
one
peak,
we
have
nearly
20,000
fire
fighters
on
duty
in
the
state
to
california
fighting
fires.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
these
were
professional
fire
fighters
your
honor.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
full
time
fire
fighters
from
the
cities,
the
counties,
the
state,
all
joining
together
to
fight
this
tremendous
holocaust
we
have
in
california.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
the
total
number
of
permanent
personnel
your
honor
is
over
2,000
in
the
california
division
of
force.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
i
can't
give
you
the
exact
statistics
on
that,
although
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
in
california,
there's
more
indians
than
there
are
chiefs;
namely,
the
supervisory
and
professional
executive
exempt
what
the
department
of
labor
claims
exempt
and
we
still
don't
know
who
those
are.
those
are
far
less
than
the
number
of
employees
that
are
covered.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
we
have
--
if
you
want
the
raw
numbers,
we
have
over
200,000
total
state
employees.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
okay.
and
i'm
sure
that
if
we
can
extrapolate,
i'm
sure
we
have
over
a
100,000,
at
least
a
100,000,
that
will
covered
by
the
flsa
amendments.
now
what's
the
point
of
this
dramatic
recitation
of
mine
on
the
fires
in
the
state
of
california?
well
namely,
this
firemen
run
up
a
lot
of
overtime
and
our
practices
then
according
to
state
law
to
give
this
man
a
premium
during
the
entire
fire
season
of
15%,
they
suddenly
jump
grade
15%
during
the
whole
season.
and
the
overtime
they
worked,
they
taken
the
winner
months
which
they
prepare
so
they
can
work
secondary
jobs
and
visit
with
their
families
during
the
holidays
and
the
like
and
you
don't
hear
that
california
employees
association
complaining
about
the
current
arrangements.
yet
according
to
fair
labor
standards
act
now,
we've
got
to
reduce
these
men
to
60
hours
per
week
and
pay
them
time
and
half
for
every
hour
in
excessive
that,
and
our
ability
to
recognize
this
overtime
in
order
than
cash
is
completely
eliminated
because
the
fair
labor
standards
act
requires
that
if
you
going
to
give
them
compensating
time
off,
you
have
to
do
it
within
28
days
or
pay
the
bill.
now,
what
possible
business
is
it
of
the
federal
government
to
dictate
how
we
run
our
fire
service
program
in
the
state
of
california
when
it's
been
proven
satisfactory
for
all
these
years?
the
impact
is
$23.6
million
annually
to
change
our
practices
in
accordance
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
what
about
volunteerism?
mr.
rhyne
mentioned
volunteerism.
in
california,
the
cities
and
the
counties
work
side
by
side
in
a
mutual
aid
program
that
is
unmatched
any
place
in
the
country.
they
furnished
these
services
to
each
other
gratuitously.
in
some
of
the
type
of
fires
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
big
ones,
the
uncontrollable
fires,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
going
to
wipe
that
out.
the
impact
on
mutual
aid
alone
in
california
is
$6
million
because
volunteerism
--
because
these
firemen
are
firemen.
when
they're
pulled
in
to
cover
a
reserve
unit
while
the
rest
of
the
crew
goes
in
helps
a
neighboring
jurisdiction,
overtime
rule
start
applying
and
the
bill
is
a
big
one.
we
may
point
out
that
the
national
league
statistic
on
this
thing
on
the
effective
this
act
nationally
is
very
conservative.
they
estimated
it
$200
million
and
they
base
that
on
paying
overtime
to
all
the
firemen
affected.
that's
a
conservative
figure.
what
the
fair
labor
standards
act
would
like
us
to
do
and
what
we've
base
our
statistics
on
the
state
of
california
is
reducing
those
hours
and
hiring
new
employees.
the
act
wants
to
hire
new
employees.
so
if
you
take
that
figure,
if
the
national
league
had
gathered
those
figures,
we
be
talking
about
$400
million
annually
to
state
and
local
government.
the
other
adverse
effects
on
civil
service
have
been
demonstrated
by
mr.
rhyne
i
think
very
well
during
his
argument.
another
thing
that
you
don't
realized
when
you
start
fooling
around
with
the
working
class
salary
at
state
levels
is
that
you
suddenly
create
compaction
problems
in
the
supervisory
classes
too.
let's
remember
that
if
you
start
paying
overtime
and
adjusting
the
wages
of
the
working
line
firemen
in
state
in
local
service,
you're
going
to
be
paying
the
indians
more
than
the
chiefs
and
that's
not
going
to
last
very
long.
so
the
rippling
effect
all
the
way
up
through
civil
service
is
going
to
be
felt
and
we
have
no
idea
what
those
figures
are
going
to
run
but
they're
going
to
be
big
ones,
and
once
which
we
think
can't
be
supported
in
fact
or
in
the
constitution.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
it's
my
distinguish
colleagues
in
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
have
taken
the
broad
of
this
court
on
three
different
occasions,
on
the
federalism
issue.
and
the
solicitor
general
argues,
these
are
the
wrong
facts,
this
is
the
wrong
time
and
the
wrong
place
to
draw
any
lines
on
the
commerce
clause.
i
disagree.
i
think
if
you
look
at
those
early
cases,
you'll
see
they're
easily
distinguished
from
what
we're
talking
about
here.
let
me
emphasis
that
virtually
all
state
employees
are
covered
under
this
act.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
that's
correct
your
honor
and
that's
the
very
next
point
i
was
getting
to.
solicitor
general
argues
that
the
flsa
does
not
affect
the
policy
making
powers
of
local
government,
but
merely
the
means
by
which
we
implement
that
policy.
you're
point
your
honor
is
right
on
point;
namely,
there
is
no
election.
there
is
no
election.
we
have
to
provide
fire
service,
and
police,
and
law
enforcement.
mr.
justice
marshall
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
employees
of
the
state
of
missouri
versus
the
department
of
public
health,
when
we
were
talking
about
article
3
immunity
of
the
states
that
the
states
couldn't
waive
their
immunity
because
they
have
no
election.
they
have
no
option.
you
can't
waive
what
you
have
no
opportunity
to
waive.
you
have
to
provide
fire
service.
you
have
to
provide
police
service.
therefore,
any
imposition
by
the
federal
government
is
a
mandate.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
discretion.
so,
let's
be
clear
that
this
fair
labor
standards
act
is
a
direct
intrusion,
a
mandate
into
state
and
local
government.
we'd
loved
to
the
words
case
overruled
because
congress,
when
they
read
your
words,
what
we
think
are
clear
words,
they
misconstrue
them.
thus
in
words,
you
warned
in
the
response
to
justice
douglas
and
justice
stewart
that
under
the
enterprise
theory,
you
convert
the
entire
state
into
an
enterprise.
that's
exactly
what
congress
has
done.
they've
turned
the
states
into
a
commercial
enterprise.
look
at
footnote
27.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
that's
an
excellent
suggestion
your
honor.
of
course,
in
my
brief
at
least
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california,
i
haven't
said
that
directly
but
i
have
attack
words
from
so
many
sizes
that
you
have
to
draw
that
conclusion.
this
is
not
a
words
case.
the
state
is
not
an
enterprise.
this
court
specifically
held
in
many
cases
involving
federal
acts
that
if
we
were
going
to
talk
about
what
affects
commerce
and
you
want
to
talk
about
enterprises
affecting
commerce,
then,
be
specific.
and
i
talked
about
two
recent
cases
of
this
court,
very
recent
cases,
not
two
months
old.
lament,
the
lack
of
specificity
in
these
federal
acts.
mr.
talmadge
r.
jones
that's
on
this
your
honor.
i
think
that
you
held
in
one
of
those
cases
that
congress
said
not
been
specific.
they
haven't
been
specific
here
either.
we're
not
talking
about
schools
and
hospitals,
in
fact
they
took
schools
and
hospitals
right
out
of
the
act.
and
now
they
say,
“all
state
employees”,
except
to
the
department
of
labor
at
its
pleasure
decide
should
be
exempt.
we
think
that
words
of
course
is
irrelevant.
it
could
be
overrule
simply
on
the
fact
that
because
the
state
purchases
goods
in
interstate
commerce,
it's
thereby
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
a
question
this
court
has
never
addressed
itself
to
is
what
do
the
states
and
cities
and
local
government
do
with
the
goods
they
purchased
in
interstate
commerce?
do
they
mark
them
up
and
sown
with
the
public?
absolutely
not.
even
the
fair
labor
standards
act
itself
recognizes
that
ultimate
consumers
of
goods
purchased
in
interstate
commerce
are
exempt.
this
is
been
an
implied
recognition
at
least
on
our
part
that
people
like
states
who
consumed
goods,
they
don't
pass
them
on,
our
ultimate
consumers
exempt
from
the
act
but
of
course
california
doesn't
compete.
the
lower
court
found
that
to
be
true.
we
don't
complete
in
interstate
commerce.
you
won't
find
california
recruiting
state
employees.
they're
waiting
in
line
in
the
civil
service
roles
in
the
state
of
california
to
join
state
service.
art
state
employees
are
among
the
five
highest
paid
in
the
country.
so,
don't
tell
me
about
competition.
we
don't
compete.
we
don't
run
ads
in
the
new
york
times
which
i've
seen
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
and
what
about
labor
strife,
that's
another
rational
that
they're
trying
to
hit
us
with.
no
labor
strife
in
california.
state
employees
go
out
on
strike,
we
get
things
call
injunctions
and
they
go
back
to
work.
and
i
haven't
--
nothing
has
been
pointed
out
to
me
showing
that
there's
any
labor
strife
in
california
that
requires
the
department
of
labor
to
regulate
local
activity.
your
honors,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
touches
the
very
heart
of
state
sovereignty
as
a
patent
denigration
of
the
constitutional
right.
yes,
i
said,
the
constitutional
right
of
the
sovereign
states
to
deal
with
their
employees
in
a
manner
best
suited
to
local
needs.
simply
stated,
the
act
is
unconstitutional
and
we
hope
and
we
trust
that
this
court
will
so
hold.
thank
you
your
honor.
