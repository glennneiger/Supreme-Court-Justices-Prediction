national

and
879,
california
against
dunlop.
mr.
rhyne,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
can
distinguish
it,
that
seems
to
be
one
of
your
objectives,
why
not
tell
us
what
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
this
record
show
how
many
would
fall
into
this
exempt
class
under
the
11
million
and
4?
chief

thank
you
mr.

where
these
all

that

chief

full
time

chief
justice
warren
e.

what
are
the
total
number
of
employee
as
in
california
if
the
record
shows
its
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
speaking
of
just
the
force;
i'm
speaking
of
all
public
employees
who
would
be
subject
to
having
their
wages
fixed
under
this
act
not
just
reporting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
state
of
california
must
know
how
many
public
employees
there
are
in
state
of
local
governments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
supposed
one
difference
is
that
the
state
of
california
or
any
other
state
can
run
or
not
run
a
railroad
but
they
have
no
choices
about
running
or
not
running
a
police
departments
and
fire
departments.
isn't
that
one
that's
been
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
there's
only
one
minute
waiting
before
lunch.
i
think
we'll
not
ask
to
speak
for
one
minute.
we'll
resume
after
1
o'clock.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
means
you
see
no
difference
between
policeman
and
fireman
on
the
one
hand
and
hospital
attendants
on
the
other
for
constitutional
purposes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
becomes
the
business
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
they
should
give
a
peripheral
service.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
transposition,
if
that's
the
bound
on
this
wound
that
you're
thinking
about
this
morning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
red
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
minnesota
didn't
take
the
trouble
to
supply
enough
at
least
so
that
i
got
one
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
with
the
figures
that
were
suggested
this
morning
that
the
pay
of
personnel
working
for
state
and
governments
in
the
country
and
municipalities
generally
is
about
80%
of
the
total
cost
of
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
measuring
the
2%
by
the
increase
that
will
be
involved
to
bring
them
up
to
fela
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
reaches
into
by
the
figure
you
mentioned,
85%
of
the
total
cost
of
government
of
municipalities,
is
that
the
figure
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
76%
i
think.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
not
for
state
and
local?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
to
--
was
there
anything
that
would
limit
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
the
entity
just
double
the
wages
arbitrary
or
triple
them
or
quadruple
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
talking
about
a
practical
political
consideration.
i'm
talking
about,
is
there
anything
constitutionally
to
prevent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
stop
anytime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
that
furnished
support
for
a
constitutional
argument
in
this
area
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
it
the
camel's
head
in
the
tenth
kind
of
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
whatever
it
is,
more
of
the
camel
is
getting
into
the
tents
under
this
court
of
appeals
holding
then
was
in
the
tent
before,
is
that
not
true?
chief

warren
e.

could
congress
include
them
if
they
chose
to
do
so?
chief

--dichotomy

chief

warren
e.

mr.
rhyne,
about
congress
enacting
legislation
without
understanding
all
of
its
consequences,
that
does

does
it?

chief

we
must
have
some
hard
evidence
on
that,
i
hardly,
i
think
so
defies
reality
that
one
could
hardly
make
any
judgment
based
on
that
kind
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
you
are
advancing
the
arguments
only
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
the
power
of
congress,
not
as
an
argument
of
persuasion
to
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
--
is
that
affirmatively
recited
in
the
legislative
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
find
the
authority
to
require
all
the
states
to
enact
a
merit
system,
roughly
comparable
to
its
federal
civil
service
standards.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
talking
about
fundamental
power
and
i
am
trying
to
--
let
me
put
the
hypothetical
question.
how
about
the
power
to
have
a
federal
act
that
would
regulate
all
the
employee
relations
of
the
states
and
they
support
local
governance,
is
it
a
taft-hartley
for
public
employee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
go
back
to
your
responses
a
moment
ago
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
said
you
could
not,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
could
not
believe
the
$2.25
an
hour,
i
think
that
was
the
figure
minimum
wage
is
going
to
hurt
anybody
very
seriously,
is
that
--
?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
congress
raises
it
$3,
$4,
$5
to
be
with
kiowa,
and
cheyenne,
wyoming
and
every
other
area.
this
is
the
new
minimum
prevails,
even
though
cost
of
living
very,
very
substantially
from
new
york
city,
washington
to
cheyenne,
wyoming
and
billings,
montana
so
far,
what
is
to
prevent
congress.
is
there
some
constitutional
bar
to
prevent
congress
from
raising
the
minimum
wage
to
$5
an
hour
next
week?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
board
would
not
discriminate
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
there
any
constitutional
barrier
to
congress
next
week
or
tomorrow?
i
put
$5
the
minimum
wage
all
over
the
united
states
and
then
to
apply
all
of
your
arguments
that
you
made
here
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
this
thing
has
always
happened
gradually,
no
has
a
coup
d
‘etat
in
this
area.
they
take
it
over
piece
by
piece
and
bit
by
bit
and
that
is
so
what
i
thought
that
what
this
case
is
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
some
of
the
colloquy,
mr.
solicitor
general,
there
was
some
discussion
about
elected
judges,
elected
officials
and
there
are
some
states
where
the
judges
are
appointed
and
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
half
of
the
states
followed
the
hopeful
trend
among
many
judges
and
had
something
like
the
federal
system,
that
is
if
the
congress
did
not
impose
it
on
first,
let
us
assume
that
they
did
it
voluntarily.
then
would
the
appointed
judges
be
exempt
from
the
reach
of
congress
and
the
elected
judges
be
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
mentioned,
i
think
you
have
a
figure
of
$135
billion
of
the
total
purchases
of
all
government
except
federal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
seems
to
be
some
consensus
that
somewhere
give
or
take
80%
of
all
that
was
spent
for
payroll.
let
us
assume
that
is
somewhere
close
to
that.anyway
it
is
a
great
many
billions
of
dollars
that
it
would
be
somewhere
from
a
$100
billion
to
$110
billion
of
the
total
expenditures
of
all
state
and
local
governments
in
the
country
would
now,
for
certain
purposes
within
the
reach
of
control
of
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whose
figures
are
these
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
that,
there
i
was
aware
you
had
it
but
we
take
judicial
notice
to
these
figures
because
they
are
labor
department
figures,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
think,
we
would
give
them
any
weight.
we
would
have
to
take
the
risk
that
there
might
not
be
anymore
reliable
and
some
of
the
figures
of
the
social
security
system
and
get
many
other
things
that
are
suddenly
discovered
to
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
federal
government
have
the
differentials
by
regions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
not
relate
to
private
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
also
you
mentioned
in
the
dissent,
there
was
also,
you
may
remember
the
dissent
in
wirtz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
done
little
by
little,
bit
by
bit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
do?
add
it
up
cumulatively
and
say
not
one
of
these
would
have
been
a
serious
invasion
but
taken
all
together
they
are
now
allowed
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
court
did
not
stop
short
of
perez?
where
can
it
stop?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
it
is
my
submission
that
one
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
the
circumstances
of
that
case
may
not
raise
it
and—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
trust
not
if
it
becomes
apparent
that
the
commerce
clause
is
in
fact
destroying
the
states
as
entities
with
sovereign
powers.
i
trust
at
that
point,
i
do
not
think
the
perez
case
is
involved
that,
i
trust
at
that
point
you
would
call
it
up
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
did
a
state
enter
into
the
perez?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
government,
the
congress
could
regulate
some
hoodlums
engaged
in
loan-sharking.
now
you
have
not
got
any
sovereign
state
and
its
powers
involved
there,
have
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
the
states
had
gone
into
that
field
or
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mentioned
the
tenth
amendment
choice
but
only
in
passing,
and
at
least
i
got
the
impression
second
time,
that
you
thought
that
tenth
amendment
really
was
not
necessary
that
the
enumerated
powers
took
care
of
the
same
proposition
--
the
tenth
amendment
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
the
tenth
amendment
has
any
functions
such
as
the
first
amendment
has
on
the
commerce
power
in
justice
stewart's
hypothetical?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
this
case
goes
beyond
wirtz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
answer
the
question,
if
i
may
suggest,
that
that
is
the
political
remedy
but
you
claim
the
you
have
a
constitutional
barrier
that
prevents
congress
from
doing
what
it
has
done.
