mr.
frank
cochran
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
a
connecticut
statute
under
which
mothers
of
illegitimate
children
may
be
forced
to
name
the
father
to
initiate
and
prosecute
a
paternity
action
to
judgment
of
whether
or
not
they
believe
it's
in
the
child's
best
interest
underpaying
of
up
to
a
year
in
jail
or
fine
of
up
to
$200.00.
mr.
frank
cochran
the
state
has
a
power
under
a
separate
section
of
the
general
statutes
to
initiate
a
paternity
action
in
its
own
behalf
for
any
child
which
is
supported
by
state
welfare,
yes.
that
statute
is
not
an
issue
here,
the
issue
here
is
the
requirement
that
the
mother
disclosed
the
name
of
the
father
in
the
first
instance
and
subsequently
initiate
and
prosecute
paternity
action.
mr.
frank
cochran
oh,
i
think
it
has
some
bearing.
i
merely
meant
to
point
out
that
decision
adverse
to
the
statute
in
this
case
does
not
strike
down
that
interest
of
the
state.
the
interest
--
the
mothers
are
attempting
to
protect
is
their
own
right
of
privacy,
not
the
state's
interest
once
it
has
the
name.
this
statute
is
applicable
irregardless
of
the
actual
interest
of
the
mothers
or
the
actual
interest
of
the
children
and
in
the
record
there
are
affidavits
for
whom
i
believe
two
mothers
who
in
fact
had
been
beaten
by
the
fathers
before.
there
was
one
case
in
which
there
was
a
possible
incestuous
parentage
and
also
in
which
the
actual
paternity
couldn't
be
determined
with
certainty.
there
are
real
reasons
why
the
interests
of
mothers
and/or
children
are
opposed
to
bringing
actions
in
many
cases.
we
submit
that
the
questions
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
frank
cochran
yes,
they
were.
mr.
frank
cochran
yes,
it
is.
mr.
frank
cochran
it
was
certified
by
the
district
court.
mr.
frank
cochran
yes,
the
new
federal
statute
does
have
pertinency
here
and
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
in
just
a
second.
mr.
frank
cochran
the
--
because
one
of
the
specific
classes
of
women
to
whom
the
statute
is
applicable
is
afdc
mothers.
the
social
security
act
is
relevant
to
this
case.
now
congress
--
mr.
frank
cochran
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
the
appellants
represented
any
other
subclass
subject
to
the
statute
and
we
have
not
challenged
that.
mr.
frank
cochran
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
cochran
the
statute
on
its
face
imposes
an
obligation
on
all
mothers
of
illegitimate
children,
however
there
is
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
a
specific
mechanism
for
enforcement
setup
for
only
three
subclasses
which
include
mothers
who
are
an
afdc,
mothers
receiving
town
assistance
and
mothers
who
for
one
reason
or
another
are
not
the
guardians
of
their
children
or
for
whom
guardians
ad
litem
have
been
appointed.
the
congress
in
public
law
93-647
which
was
passed
on
the
last
day
of
the
past
session
of
congress
did
enact
extensive
amendments
to
the
social
security
act
including
a
major
part
concerning
child
support.
the
basic
thrust
of
that
part
was
to
strengthen
the
enforcement
of
child
support
obligations
around
the
country
as
part
of
the
child
support
program
which
will
be
mandatory
on
the
states
as
part
of
their
afdc
programs.
congress
required
that
states
give
an
incentive
payment
to
cooperating
parents
of
40%
of
the
first
$50.00
recovered
from
an
absent
parent
in
support.
it
also
provided
a
sanction,
termination
of
the
mothers
welfare
benefits
made
very
clear
that
it
was
not
sanctioning
termination
of
the
child's
welfare
benefits
by
providing
that
those
continue
in
the
form
of
protective
payments
which
had
to
go
to
the
child.
in
the
course
of
its
deliberations,
congress
rejected
a
bill
as
1842
which
would
have
made
it
a
federal
misdemeanor
to
refuse
to
cooperate
with
the
welfare
departments.
that
is
the
equivalent
to
what
connecticut
does
here.
as
i
say
this
was
rejected
by
the
senate
finance
committee
and
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
that
congress
in
passing
the
provisions
which
it
did
pass
set
the
limits
of
the
powers
of
the
state
to
infringe
on
the
fundamental
purposes
of
afdc
in
pursuing
its
own
financial
interest
as
those
purpose
being
to
safeguard
the
best
interest
of
children
by
providing
support
for
them
in
their
own
homes
and
to
maintain
and
strengthen
family
life.
i
think
in
passing
the
provisions
which
it
passed
congress
clearly
indicated
that
no
other
and
certainly
no
more
severe
sanctions
could
be
employed
in
this
regard.
furthermore,
the
connecticut
statute
does,
it
seems
to
us
clearly
undermine
the
general
requirement
of
regulations
of
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
that
methods
of
administration
used
in
the
afdc
program
not
undermine
the
privacy
and
dignity
of
recipients.
mr.
frank
cochran
no,
that's
not
correct.
they
have
been
receiving
benefits.
mr.
frank
cochran
no,
this
statute
does
not
terminate
them
from
receded
benefits.
it
provides
only
the
sanctions
of
imprisonment
or
fine
as
a
contempt.
it
does
not
provide
for
any
sanction
of
termination
that
is
indeed
one
of
the
--
if
not
the
major
point
we're
trying
to
make
here.
mr.
frank
cochran
the
two
named
appellants
here
have
been
subject
to
contempt
proceedings
which
are
pending
in
state
court
and
have
been
stayed
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
mr.
frank
cochran
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
frank
cochran
they
were
initiated
before.
at
that
point,
we
filed
motions
in
those
proceedings
to
raise
the
various
constitutional
issues
which
we
have
raised
here
and
the
court
determined
to
stay
its
hand,
simultaneously
filed
the
federal
action.
i
believe
the
court
determined
to
stay
its
hand
pending
determination
by
the
district
court
of
the
complaint
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
cochran
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
cochran
that's
correct
and
the
state
court
--
mr.
frank
cochran
well,
the
state
courts
indicated
unwillingness
--
mr.
frank
cochran
the
state
court
indicated
its
unwillingness
to
decide
constitutional
issues,
it's
about
in
the
lowest
federal
court
--
excuse
me,
the
lowest
state
court.
at
that
time
the
circuit
court,
they've
subsequently
being
transferred
to
the
court
of
common
pleas
that
there
is
a
doctrine
in
connecticut
of
avoiding
constitutional
adjudications
and
--
mr.
frank
cochran
in
--
mr.
frank
cochran
i
honestly
don't
remember
that.
we
certainly
didn't
oppose
it.
mr.
frank
cochran
well,
i
would
say
a
couple
of
things
about
that.
it
certainly
is
such
a
doctrine.
it
is
not
--
i
would
say
a
favorite
doctrine
in
civil
rights
act
litigation
such
as
this.
it
is
an
exception
to
--
mr.
frank
cochran
it
--
that's
true,
i'm
not
disputing
that
but
--
mr.
frank
cochran
it's
not
clear
what
sort
of
contempt
this
is.
we
initially
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frank
cochran
it
was
not
a
criminal
case,
you
can
go
to
jail.
mr.
frank
cochran
for
a
fixed
maximum
time.
on
the
other
hand
the
state
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
a
civil
contempt
in
the
sense
that
it
could
be
purged
anytime
and
we
--
mr.
frank
cochran
i
think
the
sanctions
of
a
year
in
jail
or
a
fine
are
similar
in
that
respect.
mr.
frank
cochran
it
might
very
well
be
but
i
don't
younger
applies
here
for
a
couple
of
other
reasons.
notably
the
state
courts
stay
of
its
own
action
and
the
states
failure
to
raise
any
such
issue
here.
i
believe
i
the
broderick
case,
we
have
the
same
situation
where
the
state
did
not
raise
any
sort
of
abstention
point
in
the
court.
mr.
frank
cochran
that's
correct.
that's
our
--
mr.
frank
cochran
well,
the
state
certainly
never
raised
it
as
into
this
point
raised
it
at
any
time.
mr.
frank
cochran
i
--
it
certainly
didn't
formally,
i
believe
it
didn't
formally
either
i
have
no
recollection
of
--
mr.
frank
cochran
they
are
in
jeopardy
in
the
sense
that
the
petitions
against
them
are
pending
at
this
time
and
will
go
forward
at
some
point
unless
there
is
a
definitive
determination.
mr.
frank
cochran
their
stay
--
mr.
frank
cochran
at
this
point
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
are
stayed
until
friday
of
this
week
whether
they
will
be
stayed
beyond
that,
i
cannot
--
mr.
frank
cochran
the
state
court
issued
as
order
i
believe
it
was
in
december
to
that
effect
staying
those
actions
until
the
28th
of
february
which
is
friday
of
this
week.
mr.
frank
cochran
yes,
well
that
it
wasn't
all
it
said,
no,
it's
a
pending
hearing
in
this
court.
obviously,
it
was
aware
however
that
it
would
not
be
a
decision
in
this
court
for
that
time.
mr.
frank
cochran
i
would
say
that
they
are
not
really
pending
in
the
state
court
in
the
sense
that
the
state
has
declined
to
adjudicate
those
issues.
furthermore,
i'd
point
out
that
what
we're
looking
for
here
i
think
is
a
declaratory
judgment
principally,
i
think
it
would
be
followed
in
the
state
and
i
believe
that
this
case
is
therefore
very
similar
to
steffel
against
thompson
in
which
there
was
a
stay
in
the
pending
state
actions
at
the
time
the
federal
actions
were
brought
and
through
to
the
time
they
were
finally
decided.
mr.
frank
cochran
we
did
ask
for
an
injunction
before,
we're
not
pursuing
that
further
at
this
time.
mr.
frank
cochran
i
believe
the
determination
in
steffel
was
that
it
was
not
a
pending
state
proceeding
because
there
was
a
stay
in
the
state
court
and
that
is
the
same
situation
we
have
here.
turning
to
the
perhaps
most
basic
contention
which
we
made
below
that
the
connecticut
statute
invades
the
rights
of
privacy
in
the
sense
of
autonomist
and
family
self-determination,
this
court
has
recognized
such
a
right
as
a
basic
constitutional
right
in
none
broken
line
of
cases
beginning
with
meyer
against
nebraska
and
on
through
stanley
against
illinois.
now,
the
majority
opinion
below
did
not
--
mr.
frank
cochran
it
would
not
to
quite
the
same
extent.
i
think
it
would
invade
privacy.
mr.
frank
cochran
no,
that's
not.
there
in
fact
might
be
a
contempt
if
the
mother
fail
to
respond
to
a
subpoena
which
was
issued
by
the
state.
in
that
situation,
that
would
be
a
civil
contempt.
it
would
be
not
governed
by
the
same
rules.
here,
we're
attempting
to
safeguard
the
mother's
right
to
keep
secret
the
identity
of
the
father.
once
that
is
gone,
then
the
issue
becomes
somewhat
different.
mr.
frank
cochran
that's
correct,
for
example
--
mr.
frank
cochran
well,
that
is
the
only
way
that
the
mother
can
exercise
what
we
think
is
the
basic
right
of
determining
whether
it
is
in
the
child's
best
interest
and
in
her
best
interest
to
bring
a
paternity
action.
mr.
frank
cochran
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
cochran
yes,
it
did.
mr.
frank
cochran
it
is
somewhat
different
i
think
it
is
in
fact
--
mr.
frank
cochran
yes.
mr.
frank
cochran
i
think
that's
true
but
i
think
the
amendments
--
mr.
frank
cochran
my
argument
is
that
it
makes
it
clearer
that
it
conflicted
right
along
and
it
still
does.
mr.
frank
cochran
well,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
well
of
course
that
could
be
done.
we
would
not
favor
it
because
there
are
a
large
number
of
these
petitions
being
filed
at
all
times
in
connecticut
courts
and
that
would
involve
a
considerable
risk
for
--
of
exposure
for
the
future
to
a
number
of
the
mothers
who
have
not
yet
been
cited
under
the
statute.
mr.
frank
cochran
it
would
delay
things
and
there
is
a
second
reason.
mr.
frank
cochran
i
recognize
that
possibility.
mr.
frank
cochran
i'm
not,
by
any
mean
saying
that
this
court
cannot
or
should
not
if
it
chooses
to
remand
the
case.
the
--
i
believe
that
that
would
be
unnecessary
and
i
would
point
out
one
further
thing.
the
district
court
did
not
address
in
any
substantive
way,
what
i
think
is
a
basic
contention
here
about
the
mother's
rights
to
determine
the
course
of
the
family
fortunes
and
that
is
a
very
important
point
for
interpretation
of
the
social
security
act.
the
district
court
simply
dismissed
that
without
citing
authority
or
really
any
rationale
basis
for
whatsoever.
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
district
court
on
the
other
hand
upheld
the
mother's
right
subject
to
the
same
sort
of
limitations
which
exist
on
all
parental
rights.
that
is
--
mr.
frank
cochran
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
would
put
it
that
way
but
we
do
have
an
opinion
which
agreed
with
this
contention,
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
cochran
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
frank
cochran
the
statute
on
its
face
appears
to
me
will
apply
to
that
situation
because
the
mother
would
have
been
receiving
benefits
at
the
time
she
was
cited
with
the
contempt
citation.
there
are
however
at
least
to
some
instances
in
which
that
was
not
done
by
the
circuit
court.
however
neither
--
mr.
frank
cochran
there
has
been
construction
in
the
course
of
some
of
the
hearings
under
the
statute.
there
has
not
been
a
written
opinion,
those
hearing
seem
to
divide
on
that
issue.
mr.
frank
cochran
yes,
i
believe
we
would.
the
mothers
here
and
presumably
a
large
number
of
the
class
of
mothers
are
recipients
of
state
assistance
and
would
continue
to
be
so.
i
think
the
basic
point
to
make
here
is
that
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
in
interpreting
the
social
security
act
has
uniformly
required
methods
of
administration
which
do
not
violate
the
privacy
and
dignity
of
welfare
recipients,
that
requirement
seems
to
me
to
incorporate
the
constitutional
arguments
we're
making
here
and
to
make
anything
which
is
a
violation
of
the
basic
right
of
--
i
see
my
time
is
up,
of
privacy
to
be
a
violation
of
the
social
security
act
as
well.
in
sum,
i
think
that
this
statute
clearly
does
show
a
punitive
intent
towards
mothers
of
illegitimate
children
by
the
fact
that
it
does
not
apply
and
there's
nothing
comparable
applying
to
any
parents,
any
other
parents
of
any
other
class
of
children.
that's
not
illegitimate
purpose
and
i
do
think
that
the
case
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
