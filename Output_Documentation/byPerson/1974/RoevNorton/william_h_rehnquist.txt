justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
statute
does
apply
to
none
afdc
recipients.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
--
were
those
contempt
proceedings
initiated
before
or
after
you
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
steffel
ultimately
turned
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
pending
proceeding
in
the
state
court
at
the
time
the
district
court
action
was
brought,
isn't
it?
because
samuels
against
mackell
says
that
the
younger
rule
applies
to
a
declaratory
judgment
when
there
is
a
pending
state
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
about
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
that
you
said
you
were
just
been
on,
mr.
rosen.
when
you
say
the
connecticut
lower
courts
have
this
policy,
is
this
connecticut
lower
courts
of
general
--
of
lower
--
of
limited
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
is
it
--
does
the
connecticut
superior
court
have
had
that
policy
that
trial
court
of
general
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
these
cases
always
been
handled
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
initially
or
is
that
just
been
a
recent
status?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
your
court
of
general
trial
jurisdiction
in
connecticut?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
court
of
common
pleas
kind
of
a
misdemeanor
type
of
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
kind
the
--
it's
inferior
into
the
superior?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
there's
appeal
like
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
to
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
or
the
superior
court?
