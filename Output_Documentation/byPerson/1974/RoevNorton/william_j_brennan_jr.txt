justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
come
were
all
of
the
mothers
involved
here,
afdc
was
against?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
afdc
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
certified
as
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
take
it
then,
that
may
make
the
new
federal
statute
particularly
pertinent,
may
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
don't
it
isn't
your
own.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
suggest
these
mothers
have
standing
since
they're
all
afdc
recipients
and
only
such
to
bring
this
attack
on
the
statute
on
behalf
of
non-afdc
recipients?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
then
as
it
comes
to
us
and
confine
to
the
framework
of
afdc
recipients.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
--
i
take
it
none
of
these
named
appellants
has
been
receiving
afdc
benefits
by
force
of
this
connecticut
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
by
force
stays
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
well
have
they
in
fact
in
subject
to
contempt
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
have
not
actually
resulted
in
contempt
judgments.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
this
the
court
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
the
court's
own
decision
or
was
this
something
that
you
asked
that
the
state
courts
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
was
criminal
contempt,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
criminal,
was
it
civil
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
a
fixed
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
would
it
not
be
a
proceeding
sufficiently
criminal
to
bring
it
within
the
younger
rationale?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
your
doctrine
being
commonly
to
the
states,
the
states
may
waive
it
if
they
want
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
that's
what,
the
state
did
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
district
court
address
itself
to
the
problem
formally
or
informally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
pending
in
both
courts
are
they
exact
same
constitutional
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cochran,
suppose
one
of
the
appellants
had
abandoned
any
claim
to
afdc
benefits
after
this
suit
was
instituted,
could
you
have
had
the
suit
dismissed
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
the
mother
simply
said,
well
rather
than
provide
the
information
which
the
state
desires,
i
will
just
discontinue
making
any
claim
for
welfare
benefits,
what
would
have
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
been
any
construction
by
connecticut
courts
that
would
shed
in
the
light
as
to
answer
to
my
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
the
statute
clearly
provided
that
if
the
mother
abandoned
any
right
to
the
welfare
benefit,
she
would
not
be
required
to
respond
to
these
inquiries,
would
you
have
any
objection
constitutionally
to
that
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
trial
court
affect
as
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
i've
heard
that
in
administrative
agencies
but
i
never
heard
that
of
a
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
waive
it
mr.
arcari?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
in
the
lower
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
waive
the
younger?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
