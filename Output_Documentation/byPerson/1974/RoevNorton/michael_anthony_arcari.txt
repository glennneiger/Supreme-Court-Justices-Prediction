mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
would
your
honor
repeat
the
question.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
if
your
honor
please,
i
was
not
--
you're
talking
about
the
state
courts?
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
was
not
part
of
those
proceedings.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
to
--
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
at
that
time
was
not
in
charge
to
this
case
but
i
don't
believe
we
did.
it's
my
understanding
your
honor,
it
is
my
understanding
that
i
believe
the
federal
district
court
went
ahead
because
the
constitutional
issues
were
not
raised
by
our
opponents
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
root
of
the
problem
in
this
matter
of
course
is
the
identity
of
the
putative
father.
in
shirley
versus
lavine,
that's
in
365
federal
supp.
818,
this
case
is
very
much
unlike
that
case
in
this
sense,
in
charlie
versus
levine,
the
mother
or
mothers
involved
in
that
particular
case
were
asked
to
go
beyond
to
identify
the
father
--
putative
father
and
take
further
actions
against
the
putative
father
nor
its
institutive
paternity
action.
we
don't
have
that
problem
here.
all
the
connecticut
statute
is
interest
is
learning
--
excuse
me,
the
identity
of
the
putative
father
and
that's
all.
the
state
is
equipped
to
take
its
own
independent
action
against
the
putative
father
to
establish
paternity
and
call
the
mother
in
as
a
witness
as
provided
by
our
laws.
also
not
involved
in
this
matter
is
the
reduction
of
afdc
benefits,
that's
clearly
not
involved
in
our
case.
of
course,
the
first
step
is
utilizing
section
52-440b
in
order
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
putative
father
if
the
mother
voluntary
refuses
to
disclose
the
name.
we
maintain
that
in
connecticut,
our
paternity
laws
including
section
52-440b
are
civil
including
the
contempt
provisions.
now,
the
paternity
laws
in
our
state
do
provide
fifth
amendment
immunity
and
therefore
the
mother's
rights
in
this
matter
not
jeopardized
in
that
sense.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
comprehensive
--
connecticut's
comprehensive
scheme
here
is
the
protection
of
children.
money,
yes,
collection
of
money
form
putative
fathers
is
an
important
interest
that's
a
substantial
interest.
nevertheless,
that
is
not
the
primary
purpose
of
our
laws
in
relation
to
paternity,
that
includes
52-440b.
now,
of
course
we
recite
in
our
briefs
--
in
our
brief
rather
that
there
has
been
a
trend
to
create
a
balance
between
illegitimate
children
and
legitimate
children
so
the
rights
equal
allowed
here.
in
other
words,
we
have
some
cases
declaring
that
the
social
security
benefits
should
be
awarded
to
children
on
the
social
security
--
illegitimate
children
on
the
social
security
act
involves
their
ba
benefits
and
they're
entitled
to
today
and
of
course
their
rights
protected
on
the
wrongful
debt
statutes
of
illegitimate
children
and
the
list
goes
on.
but
there's
also
something
else
to
of
significance
here
that
there
has
been
a
trend,
at
least
i
think
it's
a
trend
greater
rights
for
the
putative
father
and
this
of
course
it's
just
beginning
in
my
opinion
that
there
had
been
state
court
cases
in
this
area
where
the
putative
father
for
instance
is
giving
or
given
the
right
of
custody
over
his
first
child
especially
if
their
--
the
mother
has
committed
neglect
or
has
become
deceased
and
of
course
that
the
father
can
provide
the
home
and
so
forth.
also
there
is
a
case
where
--
was
decided
that
the
putative
father,
his
consent
must
be
obtained
as
far
as
adoption
is
concerned.
so
it's
not
a
question
of
only
support,
there
are
other
rights
--
the
primary
rights
involved
here
of
course
are
the
children
but
there
is
the
putative
father's
rights
as
well
as
the
mothers.
we
also
point
out
in
our
brief
for
some
practical
problems
here.
for
instance,
applications
shouldn't
the
--
certainly
the
illegitimate
child
have
the
same
right
as
a
illegitimate
child
to
fill
in
blank
space
on
an
application
where
it
says
father
and
this
is
the
whole
probably
one
of
the
most
practical
problems
we
can
point
out
to
this
court.
you
also
have
in
connecticut
inheritance
laws
and
we
have
section
45-274
which
in
effect
says
that
a
illegitimate
child
may
inherit
from
its
natural
mother
with
all
the
rights
and
benefits
as
a
legitimate
child.
again,
this
points
up
be
comprehensive
--
a
part
of
the
comprehensive
plan
in
connecticut
to
protect
the
rights
and
further
the
rights
of
illegitimate
child
along
with
legitimate
children.
now,
we
say
the
specific
purpose
of
section
52-440b
of
course
is
to,
yes,
learn
the
identity
of
the
putative
father
for
the
object
of
eventually
obtaining
support
in
behalf
of
the
child.
again,
we
emphasize
that's
an
important
purpose
but
not
the
primary
purpose.
the
primary
purpose
of
course,
the
comprehensive
scheme
to
protect
the
children,
this
is
just
one
face
of
it.
now,
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
includes
all
mothers
with
illegitimate
children
contrary
to
our
opponent's
view
here.
now,
we
do
have
some
statistics
cited
in
the
--
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
believe
that
i
waste
time
covering
that
but
i
think
we
must
understand
that
the
--
what
it
boils
down
--
boil
down
to
is
this,
that
i
think
just
as
well
as
anyone
else
rights
are
subject
control,
constitutional
rights
of
any
rights,
the
mother
must
have
--
there
must
be
some
control
of
the
mother's
rights
in
this
type
of
a
problem
as
it
bears
on
the
--
her
child
or
children's
rights
and
this
is
where
section
52-440b
comes
in.
now,
we
have
claim
by
the
appellants
here
that
the
statute,
connecticut
statute
is
in
conflict
with
the
social
security
act
was
pointed
out
in
the
lower
court
that
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
social
security
act
specifically
42
u.s.
code
602(a)(17)(a)
one
and
two
give
a
frank
recognition
of
the
importance
of
establishing
the
paternity
of
an
illegitimate
child
for
not
only
for
financial
reasons
but
for
the
primary
purposes
of
social
security
act
to
ensure
that
the
child
was
brought
up
in
an
environment
in
a
family
type
life,
type
family
type
setting.
now,
our
statute
is
merely
drawn
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
as
i
just
related.
on
february
18,
we
receive
the
copy
of
a
typewritten
supplemental
brief
discussing
public
law
93-647
part
b.
again
contrary
to
our
opponents
in
this
matter,
i
don't
believe
that
the
amendments
by
congress
in
relation
to
the
social
security
act
favor
our
opponents
in
many
way
whatsoever.
quite
to
the
contrary,
i
think
they
enhance
of
states
position
here
in
this
respect.
first
of
all,
looking
at
the
amendments,
the
amendment
still
incorporate
the
provision
of
the
social
security
law,
that
was
section
602
(a)
17,
that
is
the
state
plan
must
have
provision
in
their
to
establish
the
paternity
of
an
illegitimate
child.
then
what
--
amendments
actually
did
in
my
opinion
is
to
add
provisions
to
the
social
security
act
adding
these
two
provisions
that
the
mother
nor
as
a
condition
of
eligibility.
the
mother
must
cooperate
with
the
welfare
authorities
in
establishing
paternity
and
helping
to
secure
support
for
the
children.
of
course,
cooperation
must
be
construed
the
identity
of
the
father.
i
need
to
get
over
that
basic
threshold.
now,
i
read
a
clear
intent
of
congress
saying
that
if
the
mother
elects
not
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
putative
father
under
the
most
recent
amendments
that
she
can
be
cut
from
welfare
assistance,
i
think
what
congress
is
saying
that,
alright
if
she
wants
to
exercise
that
right,
she's
off
assistance,
she's
out
of
the
protection
of
the
social
security
act.
her
children
remain
under
the
protection
of
the
social
security
act.
now
as
i
understand
trying
to
analyze
my
opponent's
view
on
this
thing
if
the
mother
is
removed
from
the
protection
of
the
social
security
act
then
certainly
i
don't
think
congress
intended
that
the
state
may
not
act
under
section
52-440b
in
the
plot
against
the
mother
here
who
is
no
longer
on
assistance.
after
all
the
states
so
has
no
obligation
to
protect
the
children
that
are
lift
on
welfare
assistance
under
the
social
security
act.
in
short,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
statutory
conflict
because
of
that
reason.
i
move
--
may
i
move
on
to
the
right
of
privacy.
our
position
that
there
is
no
fundamental
rights
involved
here.
our
opponents
discuss
that
the
--
if
the
mother
is
forced
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
putative
father
that
gets
into
an
area
that's
embarrassing
to
her,
it
appears
with
the
most
intimate
details
of
her
life,
we
maintain
no
that
first
of
all
from
the
practical
side,
when
the
mother
has
an
illegitimate
child,
these
facts
become
known
partially
any
way
to
the
community
around
her
and
i
don't
care
if
she
goes
out
of
state
to
have
her
child
when
she
comes
back
to
the
community,
the
community
or
neighbors
no
doubt
will
find
out
that
she
had
an
illegitimate
child
through
one
process
or
another.
so
the
harm
if
there
is
any
harm
here
has
been
done,
it
doesn't
certainly
involve
the
state.
we
say
also
that
the
inquiry
does
not
go
into
so-called
the
intrusion
into
the
home.
it
does
not
interfere
with
interpersonal
decisions
on
the
part
of
the
mother
or
any
one
else
she
knows
nor
does
a
judge
--
nor
are
we
sending
ourselves
up
through
the
statute
to
judge
the
mother's
misconduct
if
it
is
misconduct.
we're
not
forbidding
the
mother
to
have
a
man
in
the
house
or
in
the
bedroom
for
that
matter.
again,
it's
very
limited
in
the
sense
all
we
want
is
the
identity
of
the
father,
no
more.
she
doesn't
have
to
testify
beyond
that
point.
that's
in
--
as
far
as
the
contempt
procedures
are
concerned.
now,
even
if
there
--
we
recognize
that
the
mother
does
have
some
rights
here
--
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
that's
correct
your
honor
and
but
you're
also
--
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
that's
correct,
she's
subject
to
same
laws
as
any
other
witness
your
honor
and
but
she
does
have
the
right
of
the
immunity
of
all
the
sections
in
the
fifth
amendment
immunity
and
so
forth.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
as
i
say,
the
right
--
if
the
mother
does
have
some
rights
in
this
matter,
we
point
to
roe
versus
wade
and
i
think
the
significant
thing
in
roe
versus
wade,
this
court
of
course
recognize
that
at
some
point
in
time,
the
unborn
child
of
the
unborn
fetus
acquires
rights
and
at
that
point,
the
mother's
rights
or
rights
of
personal
privacy,
what
have
you,
i'm
not
sole
that
they
--
her
rights
have
some
bearing
under
unborn
child
right.
certainly
we
can
use
that
principle,
certainly
the
children
that
have
been
born
have
at
least
the
same
rights.
now,
while
we're
trying
to
persuade
this
court
on
is
we
must
look
at
that
under
the
rights
individually
from
the
children
or
the
mothers
or
what
that
you
must
looked
up,
everyone's
rights
in
a
collective
sense.
going
back
a
little
bit
into
connecticut's
history,
connecticut
under
the
doctrines
of
parent
--
under
the
doctrine
of
parens
patriae,
of
course
recognize
the
protection
of
children
but
it's
going
that
--
much
further
than
that.
connecticut's
court
have
made
the
children's
interest
paramount
and
they
even
go
on
farther
on
that
by
saying
that
we
will
protect
children's
rights
in
every
way
possible
and
that
includes
illegitimate
children
of
course.
now,
connecticut
has
also
even
going
so
far
as
to
alter
the
family
relationship
when
one
or
both
parents
have
caused
neglect
and
of
course
that
is
a
proceeding
usually
in
the
juvenile
court
on
a
probate
court
and
this
is
a
well-defined
cases.
now,
of
course,
i
might
point
out
that
connecticut
never
adopted
the
law
of
england
which
recognize
that
the
illegitimate
child
to
be
child
of
no
one
right
from
the
beginning.
connecticut
recognized
that
the
child
is
the
child
of
its
natural
mother
with
all
the
rights
and
benefits
that
illegitimate
--
legitimate
children
have.
now
as
i
said,
i
pointed
out
to
this
court
that
support
is
an
important
function
here
but
it's
not
the
primary
reason
and
i
can't
emphasize
that
too
much.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
state
should
whether
--
let
me
point
out
your
honor
that
our
department
is
concerned
with
welfare
matters.
so,
if
we
didn't
have
a
welfare
interest
nor
it
was
a
child
was
not
on
assistance,
our
division
of
the
attorney
general's
office
will
not
proceed
against
here.
possibly
some
other
division
could.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
agree
with
that
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
no,
it
refuses
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
putative
father
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
believe,
yes.
the
statute
too
will
apply
to
it
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
yes,
your
honor.
what
we
maintain
it's
involved
as
far
as
the
appellant
mothers
is
that,
yes,
they
have
suffer
some
shocks
and
so
forth.
of
course,
they
do
this
at
their
own
hands.
they
are
the
ones
forcing
the
issue
here
as
far
as
being
brought
into
court.
the
appellant
mothers
bring
up
the
question
of
strains
and
stresses
upon
their
children.
in
fact
that's
their
principal
argument
here.
this
argument
gives
little
recognition
to
the
stresses
and
strains
on
the
children
who
are
not
able
to
find
out
or
identify
their
fathers.
there
is
some
testimony
and
we
have
cross
examination
i
believe
as
part
of
the
record
and
it
can
speak
for
itself.
must
keep
one
thing
in
mind
that
the
illegitimate
child
must
function
in
the
community
just
as
well
as
the
legitimate
child,
that
child,
any
child
has
long
way
to
go
in
our
society
and
i
think
the
state
can't
do
enough
to
bring
the
illegitimate
child's
rights
in
balance
with
the
legitimate
child's
rights.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
are
there
statute
limitations?
yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there's
a
three
statute
limitations
and
also
i
believe
it's
one
year
from
--
if
the
putative
father
seizes
supporting
the
child
and
also
under
the
marriage
and
divorce
laws
or
dissolution
of
marriages,
there
is
a
one
year
provision,
one
year
statute
of
limitations
if
a
child
is
found
not
to
be
issue
the
marriage
during
the
dissolution
of
the
marriage.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
don't
believe
so
because
we
have
--
i
think
that's
a
--
somewhat
of
a
practical
problem
too.
i
don't
believe
so
because
you
may
have
a
situation
where
the
child
is
17,
15
years
old
and
the
statute
of
limitation
all
the
way
across
the
board
have
run
and
if
there's
no
welfare
involved,
we're
trying
to
collect
back
or
something
of
this
nature,
i
don't
believe
the
state
would
press
the
matter.
i
think
the
guardian
in
litem
may
have
an
interest
that
that's
up
to
the
guardian
in
litem
or
to
represent
the
child.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
and
there's
welfare
involved?
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
if
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run
your
honor,
we
cannot
--
that
would
be
brought
up
as
a
defense
and
that
my
opinion
would
be
what
i
know
about
paternity
matters
that
would
be
a
good
defense.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
that
may
very
well
be
but
i'm
going
to
get
into
this
a
little
further
on.
the
mother
involved
is
certainly
in
a
position
to
bring
up
those
rights
and
i
think
she
would
be
very
well
--
may
very
well
persuade
the
court
the
she's
--
happens
to
be
dealing
with
that
time.
we
also
have
a
claim
on
violation
to
due
process
of
law.
we
talk
somewhat
of
the
substantive
part
of
it.
i
think
of
the
section
52-440b
in
relation
to
due
process,
now
we
maintain
it
is
rationally
related
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
protecting
the
child
here
and
gaining
support
and
so
forth
but
the
standard,
the
procedure
involved,
certainly
the
object
as
i
pointed
out
before
of
the
connecticut
statute
is
to
learn
the
identity
to
eventually
obtain
support.
that
certainly
is
within
the
government's
scope
to
compel
testimony
and
my
understanding,
the
only
constitutional
restriction
of
the
scope
of
the
government's
power
to
compel
testimony
is
the
fifth
amendment
and
we
did
make
provision
in
other
parts
of
our
law
for
that.
what
the
opponents
--
our
opponents
bring
up
are
these
four
things
that
the
statute
creates
an
irrebuttable
presumption
and
that
there's
no
individualized
hearing
i
take
that
to
me
in
the
trial
type
hearing,
also
there
are
no
--
they're
not
sufficient
standards
under
due
process
of
law
and
the
statute
is
too
broad.
first
of
all,
looking
at
section
52-440b,
the
statute
says
when
disclosures
to
be
made
under
what
circumstances
and
to
whom
and
the
subject
matter
is
quite
restricted
if
the
mother
fails
or
refuses
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
putative
father
of
such
child
under
oath,
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
act
involved
here.
now,
once
the
court,
the
court
of
common
pleas
now,
gets
by
that
first
set
of
standards,
it
then
under
the
contempt
proceedings
in
connecticut,
it
must
eventually
answer
this
or
apply
these
standards,
who
is
making
the
demand
here,
under
what
circumstances
whether
there
is
a
refusal
to
be
sworn
or
to
refuse
to
disclose
whether
the
refusal
is
justified
in
law,
whether
there's
a
question
that
is
proper
and
whether
the
proper
question
is
recently
reasonably
related
to
the
subject
matter
inquiry
and
of
course
the
court
of
common
peas
in
a
contempt
proceeding
has
the
power
to
hear
witnesses
and
even
undertake
or
hear
defenses
in
behalf
of
the
mother.
now
also
through
the
hearing,
the
contempt
hearing
itself,
obviously
due
process
law
applies
here.
in
other
words
the
mother
will
be
protected
as
far
as
any
excess
of
means
of
--
in
other
words
state
to
extract
evidence
from
her.
in
other
words,
i'm
getting
at
is
this
would
take
care
the
appellants
fourth
argument
--
fourth
amendment
argument
here.
also,
under
the
statute
legal
process
also
applies.
in
other
words,
a
mother
--
no
one
can
just
drag
the
mother
off
the
street
here.
a
citation
must
be
issued
and
she
is
ordered
to
show
cause
why
she
should
not
be
held
in
contempt
as
far
as
disclosing
the
name
of
the
putative
father.
she
has
a
right
of
counsel
just
as
like
anyone
else.
there
is
no
--
in
other
words,
the
connecticut
laws
do
not
prevent
her
from
having
her
own
counsel.
if
she
has
--
doesn't
have
sufficient
funds,
again
there
is
state
law
or
state
policy
or
inherit
within
the
state
courts
discretion
here
to
see
that
she
does
get
counsel.
also,
in
the
contempt
proceedings,
the
judgment
that's
handed
down
is
a
final
order
and
reviewable
by
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
subject
of
review
goes
into
the
jurisdiction
as
to
the
court's
right
to
punish.
also
in
to
the
area,
could
the
acts
involved
constitute
contempt?
so
there
is
a
full
and
complete
review
including
any
constitutional
claims
that
may
arise
out
of
the
contempt
proceedings.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
it's
my
understanding
that
the
cases
of
the
--
well
the
cases
involved
in
this
particular
case
have
been
pending
for
about
a
year
or
so,
in
other
words,
the
procedure
has
taken
place
and
the
court
of
common
pleas
is
not
too
old
and
i
believe
all
the
cases
are
pending,
i
don't
think
they
are
going
forward
waiting
to
see
what
happens
to
this
case.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
no
your
honor,
the
--
right
now,
the
--
our
judicial
system
is
split
up
between
the
superior
court
and
court
of
common
pleas
of
both
trial
courts
and
it's
well-defined
as
to
which
one
has
jurisdiction
in
certain
cases.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
believe
yes
your
honor.
now,
under
the
new
reorganization
they
do
handle
misdemeanor
such
as
traffic
--
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
believe
you
could
still
classify
it
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
well,
again
that
provision
of
appeal,
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
the
appeal
will
lie,
i
believe
the
appeal
would
still
lie
under
the
present
act
your
honor,
on
the
new
act
i
should
say
to
the
supreme
court.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
contempt
provisions,
you
would
still
go
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
on
that.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
well,
if
i
may
answer
that
question,
my
understanding,
there
are
two
types
of
contempt.
if
an
act
of
contempt
is
committed
before
the
court,
the
statutory
standards
apply.
here
we're
having
the
mother
brought
in
which
means
the
common
law
standards
apply.
now
as
far
as
appeal
for
--
from
the
court
of
common
pleas
to
the
state
supreme
court,
i
believe
the
statute
would
control
the
appeal
and
i
believe
that
was
--
that
is
in
other
words
the
statute
would
dictate
the
procedure
involved.
now,
an
important
matter
in
this
of
significance
is
that
the
court
of
common
pleas
has
a
power
under
the
statute
to
exercise
some
judicial
discretion
and
this
is
put
it
out
in
the
trial
court
here.
what
do
i
mean
by
that?
three
phases
of
it,
first
of
all
the
court
has
the
sound
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
order
contempt
or
not.
two,
if
it
finds
a
mother
in
contempt,
there
still
has
a
discretion
whether
to
enforce
penalty
or
not
to
order
penalty
and
also
above
this
business
about
bringing
--
forcing
the
mother
to
bring
a
prosecuting
paternity
action.
the
court
of
common
pleas
still
has
discretionary
powers
to
do
that.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
since
we
have
other
laws
in
the
paternity
sections
of
our
laws,
that
allow
the
town
or
the
state
to
bring
a
paternity
action,
obviously
the
court
will
exercise
discretion
and
suggest
to
the
state
that
they
bring
independent
action
whether
in
trying
to
force
a
mother
who
is
perhaps
trained
to
resist
at
that
point
to
bring
this
action
because
obviously
this
will
have
in
effect
in
the
trier
of
fact.
also,
i
want
to
go
to
discussing
all
the
standards,
i
point
to
the
court,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
any
way
possible
there
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
individualized
hearing.
i
don't
believe
my
understanding
from
reading
some
cases
any
way
that
due
process
of
law
requires
a
trial
type
hearing
in
these
proceedings
as
far
as
a
contempt
under
section
52-440b.
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
appellants
are
not
on
trial
for
their
conduct.
all
are
being
brought
in
the
court
for
as
a
limited
inquiry
with
sufficient
safeguards
on
the
due
process
of
law,
what
have
you.
this
is
not
a
prosecution
type
situation
where
again
their
conduct
comes
into
focus
here
in
the
court
is
going
to
go
beyond
learning
the
identity
of
the
putative
father.
the
appellants
bring
up
the
first
amendment
rights.
they
claim
that
they
have
a
right
not
to
divulge
this
information
under
the
first
amendment
and
of
course
a
first
amendment
type
argument
we
have
perhaps
a
high
standard
being
applied
here.
i
like
to
point
it
out
to
the
court
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
prohibit
the
state
again
its
power
to
compel
testimony
here
but
it
does
obviously
restrict
the
states
here
and
it's
my
understanding
that
if
the
state's
interest
involved
is
cogent
to
justify
abridging
the
right
of
association
or
what
have
you,
then
in
this
case
the
states
--
our
position
should
be
upheld.
now
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
believe
our
position
in
this
matter
is
compelling.
i
think
it's
overwhelming
in
the
sense
of
protecting
the
rights
of
the
illegitimate
children.
certainly,
i
pointed
out
before
that
on
regard
to
the
appellant's
argument
that
they
have
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
not
to
resort
to
the
courts,
now
what
they
mean
by
that
is
again
going
back
to
the
court
of
common
pleas
possibly
forcing
them,
other
they
bring
a
paternity
action.
i
gave
a
little
bit
of
background
about
that
but
certainly
the
paternity
aspect
of
it
prosecution
of
attorney
suit
is
not
compulsory
under
52-440b,
also
the
contempt
provisions
are
not
mandatory
and
certainly
our
act
does
not
force
the
mother
or
any
mother
to
adopt
beliefs
or
attitudes,
anything
different
from
what
they
actually
believe.
it
comes
--
come
down
to
the
equal
protection
claim
here
and
of
course
the
lower
court
applied
the
rational
standard
here
which
i
think
is
a
correct
standard
to
apply.
we
pointed
out
in
the
beginning
of
this
argument
that
the
state
position
was
that
we
have
a
comprehensive
scheme
and
at
the
core,
that
comprehensive
scheme
is
to
protect
and
further
the
rights
of
illegitimate
children
are
the
means
under
section
52-440b
to
protect
those
rights
learning
the
identity
of
father.
certainly
rationally
related
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
that
comprehensive
scheme
and
also
any
provisions
under
the
social
security
act,
but
commenting
just
a
moment
that
i
think
we
also
under
that
same
argument
have
a
compelling
interest
as
i
noted
before.
we're
talking
about
the
classifications
themselves.
our
point
to
spring
up
that
there's
a
sex
classification.
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
man
yet
do
not
bear
children,
women
carry
on
that
function
and
the
point
here
is
that
we
have
a
very
unique
situation
so
i
don't
think
in
any
serious
sense
of
the
word
you
can
take
women
in
this
type
of
context
and
say
we
have
a
suspect
classification.
also
our
opponents
pointed
out
to
this
court
that
they
believe
there's
a
suspect
classification
as
to
poverty.
again,
we
pointed
out
before
that
our
statute
does
not
apply
simply
to
poverty
or
to
women
on
--
receiving
afdc
benefits
or
the
family
as
such.
they
apply
to
as
i
pointed
out
to
justice
powell
that
it
applies
to
people
not
receiving
afdc
benefits
or
any
state
welfare
assistance.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
poverty
is
a
suspect
classification.
it
was
brought
up
by
judge
blumenfeld
in
the
lower
court
that
at
that
time
the
appellants
claim
that
the
children,
illegitimate
children
became
--
were
--
or
rather
were
a
suspect
classification
and
judge
blumenfeld
quickly
stated
that
this
is
taking
the
classification
and
standing
on
its
head
in
the
sense
that
the
section
52-440b
is
designed
to
help
the
children
not
to
detract
from
the
rights
or
benefits
and
therefore
it
fits
on
the
corners
with
the
social
security
act
and
also
certainly
rationally
related
and
not
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
if
i
may
point
out
something
that
i
emphasize
again
that
we
do
not
have
a
criminal
contempt
involved
as
far
as
section
52-440b
that
it's
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
children
in
our
state
are
not
under
represented
by
guardian
ad
litem
at
certain
times
but
also
its
customer
to
appoint
attorneys
to
represent
children.
the
--
i
suppose
unless
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest,
the
guardian
ad
litem
could
be
the
attorney
representing
the
child
but
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
be.
the
attorney
representing
the
children
involved
in
this
matter
made
a
statement
which
says
that
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
the
welfare
department,
the
welfare
policy
is
to
bring
an
action
and
i
--
on
this
court
those
words
bring
in
action
against
the
mothers
involved
noted
to
get
them
disclosed.
the
state
welfare
department
does
not
bring
an
action
against
any
mother
receiving
welfare
assistance
here.
they
take
the
information,
their
policy
provides
that
they
take
the
information,
they
review
it
and
if
there
has
--
if
there's
a
problem
involved
in
the
identity
of
father
we
refer
it
over
to
outside
counsel
then
it
--
in
short
they
refer
it
to
the
courts.
and
everything
that
goes
on
from
that
point
on
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
under
the
statute
itself.
and
of
course
the
statute
itself
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
argument
heavily
controls
the
court
of
common
pleas
here
with
sufficient
standards.
and
of
course,
our
opponents
mentioned
or
made
quite
a
bit
of
the
financial
interest
of
the
state
as
long
as
i
can
--
probably
end
my
argument
on
this
note.
that
certainly
i
admit
to
this
tribunal
that
the
financial
interest
of
the
state
is
very
substantial
here.
but
i
still
think
that
the
primary
interest
involved
are
the
welfare
of
the
children,
the
illegitimate
children
and
so
long
as
i'm
a
member
of
the
connecticut
bar,
i
plan
to
work
towards
that
effort
even
though
i
may
find
myself
collecting
money
from
putative
fathers.
that
still
hasn't
deterred
me
from
keeping
that
principle
uppermost
of
my
mind
as
far
as
the
protection
in
welfare
of
the
children.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
attention.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
if
the
mother
lose
the
home?
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
believe
the
welfare
department
has
a
policy
where
they
will
attempt
to
locate
the
father
in
the
best
way
possible.
mr.
michael
anthony
arcari
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
usually
this,
for
instance
like,
we
find
that
problem
very
much
in
divorce
matters
and
a
dissolution
of
a
marriage
and
the
courts
will
rely
on
their
equity
powers
to
see
if
they
can
obtain
the
information.
of
course,
before
we
get
in
to
court,
the
welfare
department
and
the
department
of
finance
control
have
a
location
unit
and
we
work
with
other
states
using
the
social
security
number
to
trace
down
fathers
involved
as
far
as
support.
we
do
had
this
going
all
over
the
nation
and
our
only
problem
involved
is
we
don't
have
enough
manpower
but
it
seems
to
work
out
quite
successfully.
