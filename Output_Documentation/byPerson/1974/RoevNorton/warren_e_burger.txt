chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-6033,
sharon
roe
against
norton.
mr.
cochran
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
connecticut,
may
the
state
bring
the
action
on
its
own
mr.
cochran,
independent
of
the
wishes
or
the
actions
of
the
mother?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
you
suggesting
that
the
existence
of
that
other
statute
has
no
bearing
on
the
problems,
the
issues
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there's
another
production
about
this
court
and
federal
court
sustaining
until
states
do
their
--
perform
their
function.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
--
doesn't
your
privacy
claim
has
something
to
do
with
the
power
of
the
state
which
you
conceded
to
bring
this
action
independently?would
such
an
action
not
invade
privacy
to
exactly
the
same
extent
as
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
--
why
it
wouldn't
be
here
to
the
same
extent
except
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
contempt
sanction
against
this
particular
person,
that's
really
not
a
privacy
aspect,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
the
right
of
the
mother
to
safeguard
secrecy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
that
right
originate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
cochran.
mr.
rosen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
the
district
court
in
connecticut,
the
united
states
district
court
might
have
jurisdiction
in
the
habeas
corpus
case
if
there
were
confinement
under
contempt
order
of
the
state
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
necessarily,
not
necessarily.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
been
done
--
that's
been
done
many
times
in
many
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
interest
of
children
generally
in
connecticut
are
implicated
in
the
necessity
for
keeping
this
fund
solvent
and
keeping
connecticut
in
a
position
to
pay
these
benefits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
says
speculative
interest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
make
any
study
to
know
that
if
you
pay
this
money
out
without
recoupment,
it's
going
to
have
an
impact
on
the
fund?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
should
succeed
in
removing
all
the
compulsion
and
coercion
for
the
disclosure
of
the
name
of
the
father,
maybe
they
wouldn't
be
70%
voluntarily
or
apparently
voluntarily
submit
maybe
they'd
only
be
10%
or
2%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
reads
the
statute
in
order
to
save
it
from
its
--
from
the
constitutional
attack
that
you
suggest,
it
reads
the
statute
so
as
to
require
the
appointment
with
guardian
ad
litem
then
your
point
is
gone,
isn't
it,
they
haven't
gone
around
to
that
issue
yet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
haven't
--
i
shouldn't
say
you,
your
colleague
hasn't
let
the
connecticut
courts
get
around
to
that
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
so
then,
would
five
days
be
enough
or
do
you
want
ten?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
there
is
a
further
factor
that
this
might
lead
the
court
to
reexamine
its
views
about
whether
this
is
waivable,
this
abstention
question
may
be
waived
by
the
state
so
that
in
any
event
you
submit
whatever
memorandum
you
like
and
your
friends
will
have
an
opportunity
to
respond.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
will
respond
within
eight
days,
will
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
arcari.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
also
for
announcement
the
disposition
of
73-6033,
roe
against
norton.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
vacated
and
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
consideration.
mr.
justice
douglas
concurs
in
part
and
has
filed
a
separate
statement
of
his
position.
