mr.
attorney
general.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
that
connection,
let's
assume
you
have
a
mother
who
is
quite
wealthy
and
has
always
supported
her
own
child,
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
state
would
proceed
against
her
in
the
same
way,
is
that
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
statute
by
its
terms
provides
for
three
subclasses
and
one
of
the
subclasses
is
not
conditioned
on
receipt
or
welfare
at
all,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
statute
would
apply
in
the
situation
not
described,
would
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
would
apply.
now,
suppose
in
this
case
that
one
of
the
mothers
had
relinquished
all
rights
to
future
welfare
for
the
child
in
question
and
had
offer
to
repay
whatever
she
had
received.
would
the
state
continue
to
have
prosecutors
here
under
this
contempt
proceeding
or
would
it
have
withdrawn
the
prosecution?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words
if
he
refuse
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
father,
she
would
be
prosecuted?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright,
thank
you.
