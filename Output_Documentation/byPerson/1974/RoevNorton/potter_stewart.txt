isn't
that
kind
of
getting
the
cart
before
the
horse,
why
--
the
first
court
to
acquire
jurisdiction
i
gather
where
the
state
courts
in
the
contempt
proceedings,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
where
you
interpose
your
constitutional
and
statutory
defenses,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
said
in
the
proceedings
of
why
shouldn't
that
litigation
have
gone
to
its
conclusion.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
federal
court
states
its
hand.
justice
potter
stewart
you
also
asked
for
an
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
just
telling
us
what
the
--
what's
your
understanding
in
the
connecticut
law
is.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
arguing
that
as
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rosen,
before
you
sit
down
you
--
earlier
in
your
argument
volunteered
to
submit
a
brief
supplementary
memorandum
on
this
whole
question
of
the
younger
question
and
the
--
including
the
practice
of
the
interior
courts
in
connecticut
never
to
decide
or
to
avoiding
deciding
constitutional
issues
and
so
on.
that
would
be
very
helpful
from
my
point
of
view,
so
if
with
the
approval
of
the
chief
justice,
i
would
appreciate
the
submission
of
such
a
memorandum
within
a
brief
period
if
you
could.
justice
potter
stewart
that
should
be
a
memorandum
would
simply
recite
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
the
other
statute,
if
then
paternity
proceedings
are
brought,
she
would
have
to
testify
under
--
if
she
is
subpoenaed,
wouldn't
she?
justice
potter
stewart
and
again
under
the
sanction
of
a
possible
contempt
if
she
didn't.
justice
potter
stewart
as
any
other
witness
would?
justice
potter
stewart
your
brother
on
the
other
side
said
there
was
some
sort
of
a
special
statutory
provision
to
review
contempt
he
thought.
