justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
go
to
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
you
had
two
clients
in
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
understand
it
does
not
stay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
at
least
it
won't
go
forward
unless
something
else
happen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
order
in
--
does
it
order
that
the
state
court
has
issued
until
friday
this
week?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
all
that
it
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
that
the
criminal
case
of
a
statute
has
been
construed,
you
can
never
convict
the
man,
you
just
let
him
state
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
in
this
case
did
they
hold
this
for
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
do
it
here
as
this
particular
case
now
stands?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
way
for
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
to
decide
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
we
don't
in
all
other
states
we
go
out
through
the
state
supreme
court
up
to
this
court
while
in
connecticut
we
go
take
a
short
circuit
and
run
to
the
federal
court
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
cooperation
of
both
the
state
court
and
the
plaintiff.
justice
thurgood
marshall
short
circuits,
the
state
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
denies
us
the
opportunity
of
getting
the
opinion
of
the
state
court
on
one
of
its
own
statutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they?
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
impact
on
this
particular
statute
as
applied
in
this
particular
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
way
for
us
to
get
a
definitive
opinion
from
the
supreme
court
in
connecticut
as
to
its
own
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
by
constitution
of
connecticut?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
it
that
i
can
read
it,
what
you
just
told
me
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
need
it
for
myself
and
more
speaking
for
myself
because
i
just
don't
believe
connecticut
can
deprive
this
court
with
an
opportunity
to
have
a
state
court
decision
deciding
the
constitutionality
of
every
state
statute.
i
don't
think
connecticut
can
deny
us
that
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
argue
in
the
other
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
raise
all
the
questions
in
the
state
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
i
understood
then,
are
you
--
did
the
gentleman
mr.
cochran
say
that
all
of
the
points
were
raised
in
the
state
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
your
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
i'm
going
to
it
for
you,
i'll
let
you
know.
