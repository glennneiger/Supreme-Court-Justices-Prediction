mr.
david
n.
rosen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
say
one
word
on
the
abstention
question
before
i
get
into
the
substance
of
the
argument
that
i'm
making
here
on
behalf
of
the
children
of
appellants
which
is
in
addition
to
the
problem
that
connecticut
lower
courts
really
do
have
a
doctrine
that
they
will
decline
in
circumstances
in
which
constitutional
adjudication
might
seem
to
be
appropriate
to
make
that
adjudication
and
in
addition
to
the
second
fact
that
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
that's
the
position
taken
in
this
case
but
in
general
the
courts
have
to
the
amusement
of
connecticut
practitioners
as
well
perhaps
as
this
court
said
that
they
had
a
restricted
or
almost
nonexistent
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
merits
of
constitutional
questions.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
i
have
never
heard
it
of
any
other
court
but
i
have
heard
it
at
this
court.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
no,
the
position
as
i
understand
it,
the
position
as
i
take
it
of
the
connecticut
lower
courts
is
that
the
statute
is
applied
and
if
unconstitutional
as
construed
as
unconstitutional
only
by
connecticut
appellate
court.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
the
connecticut
courts
have
not
construed
the
statute
to
be
--
have
not
addressed
themselves
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
your
honor
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
as
this
case
now
stands
because
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
--
because
the
petitions
are
stayed,
you
are
right
mr.
justice
marshall
and
thus
the
second
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
their
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
and
the
state
who
which
has
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
the
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that
is
the
--
that
would
be
the
impact
of
that
statute
but
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
mr.
justice
marshall
it
is
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
this
court
abstains
at
this
point,
you
will
not
get
that
adjudication
and
that's
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
were
to
abstain
today,
what
would
happen
would
be
that
the
name
plaintiffs
in
this
case
would
be
faced
with
an
immediate
judgment
of
civil
contempt
involving
their
incarceration.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
they
cannot
appeal,
there
is
a
statutory
proceeding
for
review
but
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
except
that
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
from
the
perspective
of
my
clients
which
are
the
children
of
those
appellants.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
it
might
be
stayed
and
the
problem
is
that
the
judgment
might
not
be
stayed
from
the
perspective
of
my
clients
who
are
the
children
of
the
mothers.
in
the
event
that
the
judgment
is
not
stayed,
the
mothers
will
be
under
what
--
will
and
all
likelihood
be
an
irresistible
pressure
to
do
one
of
two
things.
give
the
name
or
dissimulate
in
one
way
but
in
any
event
not
to
serve
a
jail
sentence
while
the
case
is
being
appealed
and
from
the
perspective
of
my
clients
where
the
children,
they
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
that
would
avoid
the
--
that
would
post
the
same
--
that
would
bring
this
case
up
through
the
federal
courts
again
without
going
up
through
the
state
court
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
you're
--
you're
referring
to
possibility
of
staying
--
habeas
for
stay
while
the
case
is
appealed
through
the
state
courts.
they
might
have
that
jurisdiction
but
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
but
it
would
involve
my
clients
being
subjected
to
a
risk
that
their
mothers
will
be
unable
to
resist
the
compulsion
of
the
state
and
my
clients
as
children
do
not
have
control
over
their
mother's
ability
to
resist
that
compulsion.
let
me
speak
about
what
from
the
perspective
of
the
children
as
the
central
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
it
is.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
the
policy
is
related
to
the
step
--
the
fact
that
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
the
connecticut
circuit
court
which
were
the
courts
that
we're
dealing
with
here
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction
and
that
had
been
construed.
and
i
will
not
comment
on
the
appropriateness
of
that
construction
to
limit
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
consider
constitutional
questions
as
the
jurisdiction
of
an
administrative
agency
is
familiar
will
be
limited.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
it
is
a
judicial
construction
of
the
connecticut
constitution
which
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
the
leading
cases
are
two
cases
called
state
against
townsend
and
state
against
(inaudible)
and
with
the
court's
permission
a
supplemental
submission
on
the
abstention
question
which
is
not
been
raised
as
we
say
previously
would
give
us
an
opportunity
to
express
our
views
on
that
question.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
i'm
--
i'm
sure
your
honor
that
you're
right
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
i'm
concerned
about
the
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
i'm
--
no,
i'm
arguing
only
as
a
matter
of
practicality.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
the
state
case
has
never
proceeded
to
a
point
where
those
questions
might
be
raised.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
they
--
i
understand
is
they
may
have
been
raised
formally
or
informally.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
your
honor
but
the
state
case
was
brought
by
the
mothers.
i
was
appointed
by
the
united
states
district
court
to
represent
the
class
of
children
in
the
federal
case
but
in
any
event
the
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
thank
you
sir.
may
i
address
the
merits
for
a
moment
from
the
perspective
of
the
children
of
appellants
which
is
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
your
statement
before
that
the
statute
applies
to
all
children
is
correct
with
a
reservation
that
the
procedural
mechanism
of
the
statute
provides
that
for
children
who
are
not
on
welfare,
the
proceedings
against
the
mother
can
be
instituted
if
and
only
if
there
is
a
determination
that
instituting
those
proceedings
will
serve
the
best
interest
of
the
children
whereas
with
children
on
welfare,
that
determination
is
not
made.
now,
the
distinction
arises
in
the
following
way,
a
proceeded
--
excuse
me,
a
proceeding
may
be
brought
and
--
the
case
of
a
child
not
on
welfare.
only
by
a
guardian
or
a
guardian
ad
litem
of
the
child,
now,
what
this
means
first
is
that
a
court
must
determine
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
will
be
served
by
appointment
of
a
guardian
or
guardian
ad
litem.
second,
the
guardian
or
guardian
ad
litem
prosecuting
the
action
to
compel
the
mother
to
give
the
name
is
required
by
fiduciary
obligations
to
act
only
in
the
interest
of
the
child
by
contrast,
the
welfare
department
and
the
welfare
commissioner,
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
empowered
to
bring
actions
against
children
who
are
on
welfare.
it
is
his
policy
stipulated
in
the
record
and
brought
out
in
the
evidence
to
bring
those
actions
against
each
and
every
woman
on
welfare
who
fails
to
make
disclosure
whether
or
not
the
best
interest
of
that
woman's
child
will
be
served.
so
the
poor
child,
the
child
on
welfare
that
is
to
say,
gets
no
protection
of
the
child's
interests
and
the
child
who
is
not
on
welfare
is
ensured
by
the
procedural
mechanism
by
which
the
proceedings
are
brought
that
the
proceedings
will
be
brought
if
and
only
if
those
interest
are
served
and
will
be
pursued
only
insofar
as
those
interest
are
served.
mr.
cochran's
alluded
to
the
harm
that
may
come
to
the
children
whom
i
represent
as
a
result
of
brining
paternity
--
rather
bringing
disclosure
proceedings
where
the
interest
of
the
child
might
not
be
served.
those
harms
are
very
serious
and
they've
said
out
in
the
record.
in
the
short
time
remaining
i
won't
give
you
too
many
examples
of
them
but
for
example,
a
mother
may
be
establishing
a
relationship
with
a
perspective
stepfather
or
adoptive
father
which
might
be
interrupted
by
bringing
the
proceedings.
a
woman
who
gave
an
affidavit
below
is
the
name
plaintiff
in
a
companion
case
risks
this
fellowship
from
her
church
should
the
fact
that
she
was
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child
become
known.
in
those
cases,
a
guardian
or
a
guardian
ad
litem
of
the
child
might
have
decided
that
brining
the
action
would
not
serve
the
child's
interest
and
would
not
have
brought
the
action.
the
commissioner
of
welfare
will
bring
the
action
because
the
commissioner
of
welfare
has
determined
to
bring
the
action
in
each
and
every
case.
now
the
justifications
offered
by
the
state
to
--
for
the
distinction
of
--
or
first
there's
the
obvious
distinction
between
children
and
welfare
and
children
not
on
welfare
that
the
state
argues
a
more
substantial
recoup
in
interest
in
the
event
--
in
the
case
of
children
on
welfare.
as
to
that,
let
me
say
first
that
that
distinction
has
no
rational
relationship
to
the
precise
discrimination
worked
by
the
statute
because
the
precise
discrimination
worked
by
the
statute
deprives
the
child
on
welfare
of
any
representation
as
a
matter
of
right
in
the
proceedings
which
will
determine
whether
or
not
the
mother
has
to
make
disclosure.
the
child
who
is
not
on
welfare
has
that
protection
and
has
a
guardian
ad
litem
under
the
statutory
procedure
and
the
proceeding
can
be
brought
without
it.
so
that
the
child
whose
on
welfare
doesn't
have
a
spokesman,
doesn't
have
a
representative
of
his
interest
while
a
child
is
not
on
welfare,
it
does.
whatever
the
balance
the
court
may
strike
between
the
interests
of
the
state
in
recoupment,
the
interest
of
the
mother
in
privacy,
the
interest
of
the
child
and
protection
of
the
child's
interest
is
not
related
at
all
to
the
question.
so
whether
the
child's
interest
are
entitled
to
have
a
voice
at
that
proceeding
when
the
child
is
poor
if
they
are
given
a
voice
when
the
child
is
not
on
welfare
and
that's
the
discrimination
work
by
the
statute.
now,
the
--
in
addition,
we
talk
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
belabor
the
point
here
about
the
importance
of
the
child's
rights
and
our
position
there
is
simply
that
the
states
financial
interest
cannot
in
any
event
justify
abandoning
those
child's
rights
and
interest
in
the
case
of
children
who
are
in
welfare
when
those
interest
are
pursued
and
protected
when
the
child
was
not
on
welfare.
the
states
primary
justification
for
the
statutory
scheme
is
that
disclosure
serves
the
interest
of
all
children,
on
welfare
and
not
on
welfare.
the
compulsion
is
good
for
the
child.
to
this,
the
reply
is
so
it
may
be
in
some
cases.
but
it
is
frequently
not
the
case.
the
evidence
in
the
record
below
was
powerful
that
it
is
not
in
many
cases.
the
unrebutted
expert
testimony
we
produced
from
very
distinguished
experts
was
that
it
was
quite
frequently
not
the
case
that
compelling
the
mother
in
instances
in
which
he
didn't
want
to
make
disclosure,
to
make
disclosure
might
hurt
the
child.
in
any
event,
our
--
when
seen
from
the
perspective
of
the
--
what
we
consider
be
a
rationale
of
the
other
state
interest,
the
recoupment
interest,
this
claim
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
or
what
is
advanced
amounts
to
an
irrebuttable
presumption
contrary
to
fact.
it's
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
the
interest
of
the
child
will
be
served
although
the
child
is
denied
in
the
hearing,
a
guardian
or
a
guardian
ad
litem
if
the
child
is
on
welfare
to
attempt
to
show
that
those
interest
will
not
be
served.
it's
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
the
child's
interest
will
be
served
which
is
belied
by
the
record
below.
it
is
in
short
an
irrebuttable
presumption
which
the
state
applies
selectively.
it
applies
it
selectively
to
children
who
are
on
welfare
but
it
does
not
apply
the
irrebuttable
presumption
that
disclosure
and
compulsion
always
serves
the
child's
interest
and
the
case
of
children
who
are
not
on
welfare.
in
short,
this
is
a
statute
which
in
the
name
of
the
best
interest
of
the
child
which
has
been
the
state's
claim
all
the
way
through
as
to
the
point
of
statute
in
fact
deprives
a
subclass
of
those
children,
those
illegitimate
children
of
an
opportunity
to
have
their
best
interest
voiced
and
have
their
best
interest
be
determined.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
certainly
children
in
general
have
such
an
interest
with
respect
to
how
that
interest
is
served
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
first
that
the
interest
of
an
individual
child
where
that
interest
is
threatened
and
endangered
should
not
be
forced
to
give
way
to
a
speculative
interest
on
behalf
of
children
in
general
in
the
states
financial
solvency.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
i
say
it's
speculative
interest
because
the
record
below
indicates
that
the
connecticut
welfare
department
has
made
no
study
of
the
amount
of
money
that
they
recoup
under
the
statute
and
parallels
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
but
the
thing
that
you
might
have
to
study
is
how
much
money
you'll
get
back
by
pursuing
the
small
class
of
women
who
resist
disclosure
of
the
name
of
the
putative
father
even
when
told
by
the
welfare
department
of
the
possible
benefits
which
might
come
up.
that's
--
that's
the
money
that's
being
lost
and
the
record
indicates
that
the
money
that
is
going
to
be
recouped
by
the
state
of
connecticut
is
rather
small,
in
fact
it's
extremely
small
because
of
the
fact
that
the
fathers
may
be
absent,
fathers
may
not
be
available,
fathers
may
be
impecunious
and
all
those
factors
by
the
way
are
factors
which
the
mother
or
the
guardian
of
the
child
can
attempt
to
elicit
in
determining
whether
the
interest
of
the
child
will
be
served
by
going
after
the
father.
if
there
is
a
father
who
has
money,
who
has
resources,
the
interest
of
the
child
may
be
served
by
pursuing
that
father.
there's
a
father
whose
whereabouts
are
unknown
or
who
is
incarcerated,
whose
impecunious,
the
guardian
may
make
the
same
determination
that
the
interest
of
the
child,
if
there
are
important
countervailing
interest
suggesting
the
mother's
decision
not
to
disclose
ought
to
be
respected.
the
financial
interest
also
would
not
be
strong.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
i
think
not
your
honor.
congress
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
yes,
they
did.
the
reason
that
i
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
no.
no,
i
think
not
but
the
plans
first
of
all
apply
to
that
large
class
of
women
the
record
indicates
its
somewhere
around
70%
that
make
disclosure
voluntarily
without
any
suggestion
much
less
compulsion.
and
the
thrust
of
the
congressional
plan
as
i
understand
it
is
to
improve
the
enforcement
mechanism,
the
senate
finance
committee
which
grafted
the
new
congressional
enactment
said
that
the
committee
feels
a
mechanism
should
be
provided
to
ascertain
the
child's
paternity
whenever
it
seems
that
this
would
be
both
possible
and
in
the
child's
best
interest,
that's
on
page
6
of
mr.
cochran
supplemental
brief.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
except
mr.
chief
justice
that
as
i
read
the
record,
that
is
a
figure
that
70%
make
disclosure
before
the
fact
of
compulsion
is
brought
home
to
the
women
and
also
i'm
not
opposing
compulsion.
that's
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
compulsion
is
warranted
in
the
interest
of
the
child
and
i
have
a
position
even
yet
more
cautious
than
that
which
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
provides
not
even
a
voice
for
the
poor
child
so
that
those
interest
may
be
brought
home
to
the
connecticut
judge
who
has
to
determine
whether
to
enforce
the
compulsion
while
for
the
child
who
is
not
on
welfare,
those
interests
are
represented
and
they
are
disponsive.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
that's
true.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
except
that
there
is
still
an
important
distinction
even
where
the
guardian
where
to
be
appointed
in
the
case
of
all
children.
the
distinction
is
still
that
with
children
who
are
not
on
welfare.
the
guardian
not
only
as
appears
for
the
child
but
controls
the
proceedings,
institutes
the
proceedings
and
may
withdraw
the
proceedings
when
and
only
when
the
interest
of
the
child
dictate
and
its
that
discrimination
which
seems
to
me
to
violate
the
rights
of
a
subclass
of
illegitimate
children
namely
those
illegitimate
children
who
are
on
welfare.
thank
you.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
thank
you.
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
for
this.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
i'd
like
ten,
your
honor.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
in
that
case,
i
would
address
myself
to
what
this
court's
rule
should
be
response
of
that
offer.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that's
right,
it
certainly
start
with
that.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
then
i'd
rather
slightly
different
memoranda.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
what
i
would
say
then
is
that
the
--
that
where
my
client's
rights,
like
the
children's
rights
are
jeopardized
by
what
i
refer
to
as
a
silent
extinguishment
of
their
rights
and
in
--
mr.
david
n.
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
well,
i
would
also
say
he
has
already
waived
it
because
you
made
that
suggestion
to
me.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
thank
you.
mr.
david
n.
rosen
thank
you
your
honor.
it's
apparent
that
i'll
need
everyday
of
the
ten.
