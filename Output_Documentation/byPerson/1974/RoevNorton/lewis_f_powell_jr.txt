do
you
know
the
statute
of
limitations
in
connecticut
on
a
paternity
suit?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
statute
had
run
in
a
particular
case,
would
the
state
still
insist
on
divulgence
of
identity?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
suppose
the
child
were
6
or
five
or
4.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
and
you
spoke
of
a
three-year
period.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
might
be
a
case
where
the
--
where
clearly
the
rights
of
privacy
would
outweigh
any
interest
on
the
part
of
state.
