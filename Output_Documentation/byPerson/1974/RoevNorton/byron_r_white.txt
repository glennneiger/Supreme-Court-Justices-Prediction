justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
it
was
sort
of
like
the
misdemeanor
that
the
congress
turns
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
that
the
district
court
decided
both
the
statutory
the
collision
issue,
the
conflict
issue
and
the
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
i
read
your
briefs
here,
do
you
suggest
that
the
conflict
issue,
the
preemption
issue
or
the
statute,
so-called
statutory
issue
is
different
than
it
was
because
of
the
amended
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
--
well,
it's
quite
an
argument
that
it
is
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
connecticut
act
even
if
it
didn't
collide
with
the
old
act,
it
collides
with
the
amended
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
we
then
ask
the
district
court
to
address
itself
to
this
question
in
the
first
instance
because
that
might
dispose
the
whole
case
for
you
and
it
might
help
us
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
like
it
helped
the
connecticut
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
would
delay
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
we
might
decide
against
you
and
the
district
court
might
decide
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
will
give
you
two
swings
that
i
had
that
you
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
have
a
friend
on
the
district
court
that
might
insist
on
serious
considerations.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
--
if
they
can
--
can
get
the
federal
court
to
do
it,
is
that
it
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
in
connecticut
that
will
--
justice
byron
r.
white
pass
on
the
statute
which
is
with
justice
marshall.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
could
appeal?
they
could
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
it
is
that
they
--
and
that
could
give
that
constitutional
question
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judgment
might
be
stayed
while
they
were
appealing.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
went
to
an
awful
trouble
to
require
the
states
to
have
some
plans
in
this
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
--
not
for
a
negligible
reason,
i
would
hope.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rosen,
suppose
the
attorney
general
of
connecticut
gets
up
and
says,
i've
waived
all
my
rights
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
the
other
hand
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
going
to
say
that
the
younger
does
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
you're
not
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
he
has
already
waived
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
in
the
federal
court,
federal
district
court,
did
you
urge
the
federal
district
court
to
hold
the
stand
while
the
--
or
to
dismiss
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ask
them
to
affirmatively
to
go
adjudicate
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
show.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
talking
about
waiver,
maybe
that's
the
ability
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
connecticut
have
laws
that
apply
to
married
women
where
for
example
the
father
has
left
the
home
and
his
location
maybe
unknown,
what
happens
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
a
married
mother
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
father
has
left
the
home,
his
whereabouts
may
or
may
not
be
known,
he
is
not
providing
support
for
the
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
procedure
in
connecticut?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
statute
that
compels
the
married
mother
to
disclose
the
whereabouts
of
the
father
if
she
