mr.
rhyne,
how
about,
for
example,
the
commission,
one
of
its
order
was
partly
based
on
the
fact
that
red
ball
had
94
terminals
and
now
we're
told
that
it's
closed
35
of
those
of
the
commission.
any
mentions
of
that,
you
don't
mention
it.
in
fact,
you're
talking
about
94
in
your
reply
brief.

and
if
they
went
out
of
their
way
to,
as
i
understand
it,
to
point
out
that
one
of
the
protestants
had
closed
a
single
terminal,
one
terminal?

well,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
i
think
there
was
one
direct
line
from
atlanta
to
baton
rouge
and
the
commission's
order
was
based
on
that.
and
now,
it
turns
out,
there's
seven,
aren't
there?
