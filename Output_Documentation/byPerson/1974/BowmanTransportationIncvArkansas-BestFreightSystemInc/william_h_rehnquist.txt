justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
don't
you
also
say
that
the
district
court,
in
effect,
conceded
there
was
substantial
evidence,
but
said
there
is
something
more
needed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
some
difference,
mr.
stevens,
between
deciding
whether
a
particular
witness
may
have
spoken
truthfully
and
then
going
on
from
that
to
make,
what
you
would
call,
findings
of
ultimate
fact
that
would
be
the
basis
of
the
commission's
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
rule
50
of
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
would
call
findings
of
fact
that
you
would
call
ultimate
conclusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
really
no
more
than
a
concession
that
none
of
them
lied,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stevens.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
judge
miller
adopt
your
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
pretty
much
verbatim?
