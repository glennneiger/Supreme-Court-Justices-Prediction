we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1055,
1069,
1070,
and
other
consolidated
cases,
bowman
against
arkansas-best
and
others.
mr.
patton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here,
you
can
look
at
mine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
occasion
for
considering
remanding
to
the
commission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
patton.
mr.
rhyne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
make
that
argument
in
contradistinction
to
the
idea
that
the
court
should
weigh
and
re-weigh
the
evidence
and
see
whether
the
commission
weighed
it
correctly.
you
say
the
function
of
the
court
is
limited
to
determining
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
that
supports
the
result
it
reached.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
not
a
re-weighing
function,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
the
same
kind
of
a
function
as
the
primary
trier
engages
in.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
rhyne.
mr.
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
would
agree,
mr.
stevens,
that
at
least
a
considerable
part
of
this
case
involved
evaluation
of
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
the
weight
to
be
given
to
particular
documentary
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
square
that
back
with
the
statement
that
i
thought
you
just
made
that
the
commission
paid
undue
attention
to
the
direct
testimony
but
ignored
the
cross-examination?
now,
isn't
that
a
credibility,
in
part,
an
evaluation
of
the
credibility
of
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
[luncheon
break]

opinion
