mr.
phineas
stevens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
believe
it
appropriate
to
put
straight
two
things
that
have
been
raised
in
oral
argument.
first
is
the,
what
i
would
term
demurrer,
that
my
distinguished
brother
has
just
filed
to
our
complaint.
that's
the
first
time
we
have
ever
heard
that
our
complaint
was,
in
any
way,
inadequate.
our
complaint
was
never
challenged
below.
our
complaint
raised
the
identical
issues
that
were
ruled
on
by
the
court,
specifically
--
mr.
phineas
stevens
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
it
is
in
the
record
and
no
question
had
ever
been
raised
before
oral
argument
here
concerning
the
adequacy
of
the
complaint.
i
have
a
copy
here,
your
honor,
and
over
and
over
again
the
allegation
of
error
was
that
the
division's
order
constitutes
an
abuse
of
its
discretion,
constitutes
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
and
is
without
rational
basis.
it
is
true,
we
regard
the
substantial
evidence
rule
as
being
a
rule
uniquely
designed
to
testing
the
propriety
of
a
finding
of
fact,
the
sufficiency
of
that
finding
of
fact.
the
findings
of
fact
are
not
in
issue.
they
had
never
been
in
issue.
so,
we
did
not
allege
that
any
finding
of
fact
itself
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
we
allege
that
the
treatment
of
these
findings
the
conclusions
drawn
from
the
findings
lacked
a
rational
basis.
they
were
arbitrary.
they
were
capricious.
they
constituted
an
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
what
are
the
findings
of
fact?
distinguished
counsel
for
the
government
has
said
for
the
first
time
that
the
appendices
do
not
constitute
findings
of
fact.
that
quite
frankly,
may
it
please
the
court,
comes
as
a
surprise.
they
are
the
findings
of
fact.
they
were
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
examiner's
report
and
in
the
division
report,
and
what
are
they?
he
says
“they
are
summaries
of
evidence,
but
i
do
not
know
what
a
summary
of
the
evidence
is,
unless
it
is
a
finding
of
fact.”
mr.
phineas
stevens
that
--
the
latter,
your
honor,
is
what
i
would
call
a
conclusion
drawn
from
the
facts.
what
the
witness
said
is
not
in
dispute.
mr.
phineas
stevens
no,
i
do
not
know
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
i
would
call
findings
of
fact
these
statements
as
to
what
the
witnesses
said,
what
the
exhibits
established
as
set
forth
in
the
appendices
to
the
report,
and
there
is
no
difference
as
to
what
the
witnesses
said
and
what
the
exhibits
said.
mr.
phineas
stevens
no,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
testing
their
credibility,
but
what
is
it?
what
did
they
say?
what
did
they
establish?
what
did
they
prove
in
their
testimony?
our
complaint,
your
honor,
lies
with
the
treatment
of
that
evidence.
what
conclusions
can
be
drawn
from
those
facts?
mr.
phineas
stevens
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
as
the
court
below
thought
that
the
arbitrary
or
capricious
standard
--
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
abuse
of
discretion
is
a
test,
a
standard
that
more
suitably
describes
that
particular
type
of
error.
mr.
phineas
stevens
no,
i
won't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
believe
that
the
court
could
have
reached
every
conclusion
that
it
reached
in
terms
of
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
when
the
court
said
--
mr.
phineas
stevens
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
every
finding
or
conclusion
of
the
lower
court
could
have
been
expressed
in
terms
of
lack
of
substantial
evidence.
mr.
phineas
stevens
no,
your
honor.
mr.
phineas
stevens
because,
when
you
consider
the
entire
record,
there
is
so
much
evidence
that
shows
to
the
contrary.
mr.
phineas
stevens
phrased
in
that
manner,
your
honor,
yes,
there
is
some
evidence.
is
there
substantial
evidence?
mr.
phineas
stevens
term
--
in
terms
of
substantial
evidence,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
phineas
stevens
because,
your
honor,
you
would
have
to
consider
only,
for
example,
the
direct
testimony
of
the
witness.
if
you
looked
at
his
cross-examination
and
if
you
looked
at
the
evidence
submitted
in
protestants
and
weighed
it
all
together,
the
substantiality
would
disappear.
mr.
phineas
stevens
the
court
disagreed
with
it.
mr.
phineas
stevens
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
phineas
stevens
no,
what
i'm
trying
to
explain
is
that
the
way
the
commission
looked
at
this
was
to
consider
only
bits
and
pieces
of
the
record,
and
they
said
“we
will
not
consider
the
rest
of
the
evidence.”
mr.
phineas
stevens
the
principal
statement,
i
think,
is
summarized
very
succinctly
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
appellants
filed
just
a
few
days
ago.
they
say
that
the
treatment
of
the
evidence
by
the
commission
is
fully
supported
by
reasonings
set
forth
in
its
report.
and,
these
reasonings
are
illustrative
of
the
commission's
“careful
weighing
of
the
evidence.”
mr.
phineas
stevens
that's
on
page
6
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
phineas
stevens
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
phineas
stevens
not
--
i
would've
found
otherwise,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
phineas
stevens
because
--
mr.
phineas
stevens
no,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
because
when
you
look
at
what
i
was
coming
to,
when
they
cite
why
did
the
commission
not
give
consideration
to
the
evidence.
they
say
that
that
it
constitutes
a
valid
reason
for
not
giving
consideration
to
this
evidence.
we
say
it's
no
reason
at
all.
it's
a
completely
arbitrary,
unreasonable
rejection
of
tremendous
portions
of
the
record.
now,
if
you
do
away
with
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
not
submitted
by
these
applicants
and
have
it
as
an
ex
parte
proceeding,
you
could
find
substantial
--
mr.
phineas
stevens
they
did
not
--
mr.
phineas
stevens
they
did
not
ignore
all
of
the
evidence.
they
did
ignore
the
most
important
part
of
the
evidence
presented
by
one
group
of
the
parties,
and
they
gave
a
reason
why
they
were
disregarding
it.
the
reason
they
gave
was
no
reason
at
all.
it
was
completely
arbitrary
reason.
the
same
reason
they
say
“we
will
not
accord
weight
to
this
body
of
evidence,”
would
have
required
them
to
accord
no
weight
to
the
body
of
evidence
they
did
accord
weight
to.
what
was
the
reason?
the
reason
they
said
was
that
most
of
these
studies
relate
to
short
periods
of
time.
these
were
the
same
periods
of
time
that
they
gave
great
weight
to,
to
the
other
evidence.
they
said
“or
they
cover
traffic
handled
for
specific
shippers.
we
will
not
accord
weight
to
this
body
of
evidence
because
it
was
directed
to
traffic
handled
for
specific
shippers.”
that
is
the
reason
they
wouldn't
accord
it
any
weight.
of
course
it
was
directed
to
specific
shippers.
it
was
designed
to
rebut
specific
evidence
given
by
witnesses.
a
witness
would
come
in
and
say
“i
am
having
some
problems.
here,
i
would
give
you
some
freight
bills
to
demonstrate
service
that
i
do
not
think
is
satisfactory.
this
carrier
did
such
and
such
and
such,”
and
he
would
give
a
few
examples
which
he
considered
to
be
poor.
then,
when
the
protestants,
the
existing
carriers
came
in,
they
spent
months
searching
their
records.
they
brought
in
original
documents
of
120,000
shipments.
they
analyzed
those.
they
brought
in
specific
exhibits
saying
“--
this
witness
said
this
service
isn't
satisfactory.
look,
here
are
all
of
our
records
that
we
handle
for
that
shipper
during
a
period
of
time.
he
isn't
correct.
mr.
phineas
stevens
we
made
all
of
those
arguments
in
our
briefs
before
the
commission.
we
have
made
--
mr.
phineas
stevens
the
commission
did
not
consider
them,
your
honor.
mr.
phineas
stevens
no,
sir.
they
did
not
consider
them.
they
rejected
our
petition
summarily,
12
working
days
after
the
briefs
were
in,
with
no
opinion
whatever.
this
--
this
reason--
mr.
phineas
stevens
they
overruled
it.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
used
the
wrong
term,
your
honor.
they
overruled
our
petitions
without
an
opinion.
mr.
phineas
stevens
yes
sir,
and
they
did
not
give
any
consideration
to
our
argument.
this
reason
for
rejecting
this
evidence
was
not
a
reason
assigned
by
any
of
the
parties.
these
parties
were
represented
by
the
most
able
counsel
at
the
commission's
bar.
they
did
not
suggest
that
this
was
a
reason
because
it
isn't
a
valid
reason.
it
lacks
any
logic,
any
justification,
whatever.
it
is
of
no
more
reason
than
if
the
commission
had
said
“i
reject
this
evidence
because
the
witness
that
presented
it
was
red-headed.”
it
would
be
no
more
sense
to
what
they
say
“we
reject
this
evidence
because
it
relates
to
specific
shippers.”
of
course
it
related
to
specific
shippers.
that
was
the
entire
purpose
of
it,
to
rebut
specific
evidence.
one
carrier
alone
brought
in
an
exhibit
showing
service
rendered
for
150
shippers.
with
one
stroke
of
the
pen,
all
of
that
evidence
went
out
of
the
window.
that's
the
most
important
evidence
that
we
presented
in
the
case.
mr.
phineas
stevens
your
honor,
no
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
not
to
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.
that
is
not
in
issue.
what
the
witnesses
said
was
recorded
by
the
examiners,
no
dispute
as
to
that.
mr.
phineas
stevens
i
use
that
as
an
illustration
because
the
commission
did
in
fact
consider
only
that
portion
of
the
witness'
testimony,
for
example,
that
it
come
out
on
direct.
everything
that
came
out
on
cross,
although
that
was
recorded
in
the
examiner's
findings
to
which
no
exception
was
taken,
no
weight
was
given
to
it.
it
was
disregarded.
that
portion
of
the
evidence
was
disregarded
but,
more
significantly,
the
rebuttal
evidence,
all
of
the
evidence
in
opposition
was,
in
effect,
thrown
out
of
the
window
by
this
statement
that
“we
will
not
give
--
consider
this
evidence
as
entitled
to
any
weight
for
these
reasons.”
now,
what
the
court
said
was
“those
reasons
are
not
valid.
we
are
not
ourselves
weighing
the
evidence,
but
we
are
saying
that
the
commission
did
not
weigh
the
evidence.”
the
commission
looked
at
only
one
side
of
the
case
and
when
it
came
to
the
other
side
of
the
case,
it
said
“we
won't
give
consideration
to
it
for
these
reasons,”
and
they're
no
reasons
at
all.
they
are
not
justifications.
the
court
said
this
is
an
arbitrary,
capricious,
it
lacks
a
rational
basis.
that
is
why
we
couched
our
complaint
more
in
terms
of
the
first
subparagraph
of
section
706
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
rather
than
in
subparagraph
(d)
relating
to
substantial
evidence.
it's
because
that
paragraph
uniquely
describes
the
type
of
error
that
was
done
in
this
case.
the
lower
court
said
this,
your
honor.
the
lower
court
said
that
the
commission
did
not
apply
the
basic
rudiments
of
fairness,
that
the
commission's
report
indicates
a
predilection
to
grant
these
particular
applications
followed
by
a
strained
attempt
to
marshal
facts
to
support
such
findings.
the
strain
was
too
much
for
the
court
to
bear,
and
it
said,
viewed
in
its
entirety,
the
report
sounds
more
in
advocacy
than
an
impartial
adjudication.
but,
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so,
it
just
isn't
good
advocacy,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
say
we
will
not
give
consideration
to
this
evidence
because
it
relates
to
specific
shippers.
none
of
the
advocates
would
make
such
a
statement.
the
commission
did
that
of
its
own
motion
and
if
that
is
grounds
to
disregard
or
not
give
weight
to
testimony,
that
ground
automatically
applies
to
every
shipper
that
testified
in
the
case,
because
he
testified
only
about
his
particular
traffic.
now,
if
that
is
an
invalid
reason
for
considering
his
evidence,
it
applies
to
all
of
it.
the
court
said
that
the
commission
applied
a
prejudicial
and
discriminatory
double
standard.
it
applied
one
standard
to
evidence
presented
by
certain
parties.
when
it
came
to
other
parties,
it
applied
a
different
standard.
let
me
illustrate
one
of
those
instances.
in
the
early
part
of
its
report,
the
commission
was
dealing
with
certain
exhibits
showing
what
a
particular
applicant
had
been
doing.
he
says
“you
can
test
what
i
propose
to
do
by
what
i
am
now
doing,”
and
presented
statistical
data
showing
that,
for
example,
during
a
one-week
test
period
in
early
1966
this
particular
applicant
was
operating
from
richmond
to
memphis
an
average
of
two-and-a
half
days
in
transit.
well,
we
came
in
and
said
“what
does
two-and-a
half
day
in
transit
really
mean?”
it's
almost
a
meaningless
figure.
so,
we
took
those
identical
statistics,
their
figures,
and
we
analyzed
them
in
accordance
with
their
proposal
and
we
said
“look
here.”
what
does
it
mean?
it
means
that
they
are
performing
their
service.
they
are
getting
the
freight
on
time
55%
of
the
time.
whereas,
all
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
had
said
“that's
not
the
type
of
service
we
want.”
yet,
that
is
the
type
of
service
that
the
applicant
was
performing.
that
is
the
type
of
service
the
applicant
says
“you
can
test
what
i
propose
to
do
by
what
i
am
now
doing.”
now,
on
page
116
of
the
report,
the
commission
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
applicant
can
do
this
because
it's
--
now
operating
two-and-a
half
days
from
richmond
to
memphis.
over
in
a
subsequent
part
of
the
report,
dealing
with
our
contention
that
the
applicant's
own
exhibits
showed
that
they
were
not
performing
and
could
not
perform
in
the
manner
in
which
they
had
represented
to
the
witnesses
they
would
perform,
what
did
the
commission
do
there?
the
commission
says
proof
of
past
performance
cannot
be
used
to
test
what
an
applicant
proposes
to
do.
they
took
the
same
exhibit,
the
same
sheet
of
paper
and
in
the
early
part
of
its
report
we
make
certain
findings
based
upon
this
exhibit.
later
on,
without
apparently
realizing
they
were
talking
about
the
same
sheet
of
paper,
they
said
this
type
of
evidence
is
entitled
to
no
prohibitive
value.
that
is
exactly
what
is
in
this
report
and
the
court
says
that
that
shows
a
predilection
to
grant
these
particular
applications
followed
by
a
strained
attempt
to
marshal
facts
to
support
it.
now,
in
the
court
below,
this
applicant
was
still
urging
“test
what
we
propose
to
do
by
what
we
showed
we
have
been
doing.”
the
commission
had
said
“we
won't
look
at
that
test
except
insofar
as
it's
favorable.
as
to
its
unfavorable,
we
will
not
look
at
it.”
mr.
phineas
stevens
yes,
sir?
mr.
phineas
stevens
pretty
much
verbatim,
he
did,
your
honor.
what
he
did
was,
during
the
oral
arguments
on
the
case,
counsel
asked
for
permission
to
file
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
as
required
by
a
local
courtroom.
the
court
said
“yes,
you
may
do
so
but
get
him
in
early
because
we're
going
to
work
on
our
decision.”
all
parties
then
filed
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
the
appellants
filed
them
in
the
form
of
a
proposed
opinion
with
just
signature
lines
for
the
court.
we
filed
them
in
the
more
standard
form.
we
request
the
court
to
find
this
and
conclude
this.
and,
the
court
said
“we
have
considered
all
of
the
proposed
findings.
we
find
those
of
the
plaintiff's
correct
and
we
adopt
them
as
follows.”
yes,
it
was
an
affirmative
adoption
of
most
of
the
findings
and
conclusions.
however,
in
its
opinion,
the
court
added
other
things
on
its
own.
other
cases
encoded
from
them
wrote
an
appendix
that
we
hadn't
even
suggested.
as
to
the
proper
scope
of
review,
the
appellants
say
that
substantial
evidence
rule
is
the
only
rule
that
can
be
applied
in
an
adjudicatory
proceeding,
a
case
that
comes
before
the
court
after
an
adjudicatory
proceeding.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
a
correct
statement.
it
is
an
oversimplification.
the
substantial
evidence
rule,
of
course
does
apply
only
to
adjudicatory
proceedings,
but
it
is
by
no
means
the
only
rule
or
test
that
applies
to
adjudicatory
proceedings.
adjudicatory
proceedings
must
meet
the
standard
of
constitutional
requirements,
statutory
requirements,
procedural
due
process,
as
well
as
the
rule
that
was
elaborated
on
in
the
overton
park
case,
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law
as
stated
in
the
overton
park
case.
in
all
cases,
this
rule
applies.
mr.
phineas
stevens
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court,
sir.
mr.
phineas
stevens
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
the
court,
sir,
if
i
may
go
back
and
review
briefly
a
few
of
the
facts
that
i
neglected
to
mention
at
the
outset.
mr.
rhyne
has
stated
that
the
chief
problem
discussed
by
these
shippers
was
that
freight
came
out
of
the
east
down
to
certain
points
then
it
had
to
change
to
another
carrier
and
go
forward.
that
is
an
oversimplification.
on
certain
lines
between
certain
points,
that
is
correct.
between
other
points,
there
was
one-line
service
all
the
way
through,
but
the
shippers
would
say
“we
would
like
to
have
another
one-line,
single-line
service
is
the
proper
term,
from
a
to
b.”
there
is
not
enough
service
from
that
standpoint.
first,
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
there
isn't
a
single
point
proposed
to
be
served
that
did
not
have
multiple
service
at
the
time
of
the
applications.
also,
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
they
proposed
on
a
very
highly
limited
selective
type
of
service
to
go
through
the
small
communities
and
serve
only
the
major
communities
and
leave
to
the
existing
carriers
the
obligation
to
handle
the
less
profitable
freight
to
the
smaller
communities.
the
examiners
found
that
the
approval
of
any
1
of
these
10
applications
would
result
in
a
deterioration
of
service
primarily
to
the
smaller
communities,
but
also
to
the
larger
communities,
that
the
public
interest
would
be
damaged
by
the
approval
of
any
one
of
those.
the
facts
upon
which
those
findings
were
--
conclusions
were
based
were
adopted
verbatim
by
the
division,
but
they
reached
a
different
conclusion
from
those
facts.
i
think
it
might
be
also
helpful
to
note
that
this
was
not
a
general
influx
of
citizens
asking
for
service.
this
was
not
a
general
investigation
by
the
commission,
which
they
could
have
done.
these
are
individual
applicants
that
had
sought
a
particular
service.
they
were
consolidated
for
hearing
and
we
had
here
the
most
unusual
situation
of
having
ten
major
applications
heard
on
one
record.
one
of
the
things
it
resulted
in,
each
time
an
applicant
would
call
a
witness
to
the
stand
he
would
be
criticizing
other
applicants.
so,
we
saw
that
there
was
no
difference
really
between
the
applicants
and
the
protestants.
also,
it
should
be
noted
that
these
shippers
were
not
parties.
they
were
witnesses,
41
of
them
were
permitted
to
intervene
as
parties
represented
by
mr.
rhyne
after
the
initial
decision
had
been
made.
it
was
only
then
that
any
suggestion
had
been
made
of
any
antitrust
issue.
up
to
then,
the
consideration
by
the
examiners
was
just
the
opposite.
there
is
so
much
service
that
it
is
really
destructive
competition
at
the
present
time.
also,
mention
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
the
affirmance
of
this
case
would
result
in
denying
service
to
a
large
number
of
shippers.
with
deference,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
submit
that
just
the
contrary
would
be
true.
in
the
first
place,
the
most
unusual
aspect
of
this
case
is
that
while
it
was
pending
in
the
commission,
there
was
a
massive
increase
in
single-line
service
that
took
place
with
commission
approval.
bearing
in
mind
that
the
whole
theory
of
the
case
was
not
that
there
is
not
sufficient
service,
but
there
is
not
sufficient
single-line
service.
the
commission
found,
and
all
of
the
witnesses,
all
of
the
parties
acknowledged,
that
there
is
a
direct
correlation
between
the
number
of
times
a
shipment
changes
hands
and
the
expeditiousness
of
the
shipment.
so,
single-line
service
per
se
is
of
utmost
importance.
the
entire
theory
of
the
case
was
predicated
upon
that.
so,
what
took
place
was
that,
while
these
cases
were
pending
before
the
commission,
there
were
a
series
of
mergers,
consolidations
with
commission
approval,
and
a
few
new
grants
of
authority.
the
examiners
took
note
of
that.
for
example,
they
pointed
out
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
between
the
focal
points
of
the
application,
atlanta
and
dallas,
there
were
three
single-line
carriers.
but,
at
the
time
of
their
decision
in
1969,
there
were
seven
such
carriers.
the
examiners
said,
given
effect
to
the
present
service
available,
bearing
in
mind
the
statutory
criteria
to
determine
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
and
necessity,
we
find
that
there
is
a
multiplicity
of
service
available.
when
it
went
before
the
--
a
division
composed
of
3
of
the
11
commissioners,
we
petition
to
reopen
to
present
proof
of
the
changed
conditions.
the
commission
says
“no,
that
will
not
be
necessary.
under
our
decision,
citing
primarily
the
west
brothers
case,
we
will
give
effect
to
this
increase
in
service.”
now,
incidentally,
the
west
brothers
case
is
particularly
unique
because
it
involved
two
of
the
points
involved
and
the
carriers
involved.
briefly
stated,
the
commission
had
granted
west
authority
to
operate
from
alabama
to
louisiana
which
included
authority
to
operate
from
birmingham
to
baton
rouge.
after
that
grant
had
been
approved,
certain
protestants
petitioned
the
commission
for
reconsideration,
as
we
did
in
this
case,
pointing
out
that
in
another
case,
while
it
was
--
the
west
brothers
case
was
pending
and
the
mercury
case,
the
commission
had
granted
mercury
authority
to
operate
between
birmingham
and
baton
rouge.
the
commission
says
“that's
right”.
we
must
give
effect
to
our
grants
and
other
proceedings.
we
re-opened
the
west
brothers
case.
we
modified
that
so
as
to
eliminate
from
the
grant
to
west
brothers
to
authority
to
operate
between
birmingham
and
baton
rouge
we've
given
mercury.”
now,
mercury
wasn't
even
a
party
to
the
west
brothers
case,
but
they
properly
gave
effect
to
their
other
decisions.
in
other
words,
letting
the
right
hand
know
what
the
left
hand
was
doing.
in
our
case,
they
cited
west
brothers
as
authority
for
the
proposition
“we
must
give
effect,”
but
what
did
they
do?
they
granted
two
more
carriers,
red
ball
and
bowman
authority
from
birmingham
to
baton
rouge
that
they
had
just
said
in
west
“we
can't
do,”
and
three
more
from
atlanta
to
baton
rouge,
all
three
of
these
applicants.
so,
at
the
time
of
the
commission
decision,
they
went
back
and
looked
at
an
exhibit
that
had
been
introduced
by
johnson
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
summarizing
all
of
the
available
single-line
service.
and,
they
said
“based
on
that
exhibit,
we
conclude
there
is
a
paucity
of
single-line
service
available
and,
in
that
respect,
we
take
note
of
the
fact
that
in
1970
census,
compared
to
1960
census,
there
has
been
an
increase
in
population.”
so
they
judged,
and
the
only
comprehensive
analysis
they
made
of
the
quantity
of
service
available
was
based
upon
the
condition
in
early
1966.
they
concluded
there
is
a
paucity
of
single-line
service
available,
ignoring
the
examiner's
conclusion
that,
given
effect
to
the
changes,
there
is
now
a
multiplicity
of
service.
but,
what
had
taken
place?
two
more
years
had
transpired
between
the
examiner's
decision
and
the
division
decision
and,
by
then
the
7
between
atlanta
and
dallas
had
grown
to
13.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
there
was
one
single-line
carrier
between
baton
rouge
and
atlanta.
at
the
time
of
the
division's
decision,
there
were
7.
so,
the
witnesses
had
been
saying
“we
would
like
to
have
another
carrier
available.”
without
exception,
they
all
had
multiple
other
carriers
available.
the
commission,
in
certain
respects,
said
this
case
is
moot
as
to
certain
aspects
of
it
that
are
not
important
here.
we
submit,
they
could
just
as
well
have
said
the
entire
case
is
moot
because
the
issue
is
the
--
a
contention
there
is
a
need
for
addition
of
single-line
service
and
there
has
been
a
massive
influx
of
single-line
service
occurred
while
these
cases
are
pending.
instead
of
doing
that,
saying
“we
must
give
effect
to
these
recent
grants,”
they
did
not
give
effect
to
the
recent
grants.
instead,
they
continued
on,
what
the
court
termed,
“a
prejudicial
and
discriminatory
double
standard.”
i
would
like
to
illustrate
that
a
little
bit
further.
i
have
mentioned
these
transit
term
studies.
they
were
the
most
important
part
of
our
evidence.
that's
true,
but
they
did
other
things.
what
about
the
transit
time
studies
that
the
shippers
themselves
introduced?
they
were
fragmentary,
individual
shippers
showing
different
things.
so,
after
the
applicants
had
all
rested,
there
was
a
several-month
recess.
we
took
every
single
transit
time
study
presented
by
every
witness
and
made
it
into
a
composite
analysis
where
you
could
look
at
it
together
and
not
fragmentary.
what
did
it
show?
it
showed
that
the
protestant
service
reflected
by
those
exhibits
between
the
points
that
we
studied
was
superior
to
the
applicant
service
but
more
significantly,
that,
overall,
the
service
was
reasonably
satisfactory
even
bearing
in
mind
that
the
shippers
had
set
about
to,
in
most
instances,
to
give
the
horrible
examples
of
poor
service.
the
commission
would
not
give
effect
to
our
analysis,
the
composite
analysis,
but
looked
on
it
to
the
fragmentary
exhibits
as
they
were
introduced.
the
commission
said
this.
certain
protestants
have
restrictions
in
their
tariffs
and
engage
in
certain
restrictive
practices.
well,
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
think
that's
important.
the
commission
has
plenary
power
to
require
a
carrier
to
do
away
with
any
restrictive
practice
or
eliminate
from
its
tariff
any
restrictive
provision.
we
heard
argument
to
that
effect
this
morning
in
connection
with
a
different
section
of
the
act,
but
what
did
they
do?
they
said
“one
of
the
reasons
we
want
to
grant
this
is
because
the
protestants
have
restrictions,”
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
applicants
had
the
identical
restrictions
and,
while
the
case
was
pending,
published
additional
ones.
we
pointed
that
out.
they
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
that,
but
just
hung
their
findings
on
the
fact
that
the
protestants
had
certain
restrictions.
they
went
out
of
the
record
and
out
of
their
way,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
to
take
official
notice
of
an
industry
publication
that
said
that
one
of
the
protestants
had
closed
one
terminal,
subsequent
to
the
hearing,
in
one
town
in
mississippi.
we
had
been
arguing
that
the
applicant's
proposals
were
not
realistic
because,
among
other
things,
there
was
bowman
proposing
to
establish
a
whole
series
of
new
terminals,
whereas,
it
served
vast
areas
in
the
east
where
it
had
no
terminals
at
all,
over
100
cities
of
comparable
size
where
it
had
no
terminals.
we
were
pressing
that
point.
they
ignored
that
argument
but
went
outside
of
the
record
to
take
official
notice
of
the
fact
that
one
protestant
had
closed
a
terminal
in
one
point.
when
they
did
that,
we
petitioned
them
but,
look
here.
the
same
publication
will
show
that
red
ball,
one
of
the
applicants,
has
closed
35
of
its
terminals.
yet,
the
commission
said
“one
of
the
reasons
we
are
going
to
grant
authority
to
red
ball
is
because
it
has
92
terminals.”
that
fact
was
not
correct.
it
was
correct
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
but
it
was
not
correct
at
the
time,
it
appeared
in
the
commission's
report.
they
have
closed
35
of
their
terminals.
the
appellants
still
cite
that
in
their
reply
brief
to
this
court,
filed
a
few
days
ago,
justifying
the
commission's
grant,
the
finding
that
there
were
92
terminals
pointing
out
that,
really,
the
closing
of
the
terminal
of
red
balls
was
not
reflected
in
the
same
edition
of
that
american
motor
carrier
directory
but
in
another
edition.
they
could
have
pointed
it
out
to
the
commission
if
they
had
seen
it
fit
to
do
so.
this
is
a
changed
condition.
we
bring
it
to
your
attention.
again,
one
standard
was
applied
to
the
applicants.
a
different
standard
was
applied
to
the
protestants.
in
every
instance
where
there
was
a
criticism,
as
pointed
out
by
the
examiners,
those
criticisms
applied
to
the
applicants
as
well
as
to
the
protestants.
they
did
not
give
effect
to
any
of
those.
so,
we
filed
a
petition.
it
was
overruled
by
a
2:1
vote
of
the
commission
without
an
opinion.
we
asked
for
the
entire
commission
to
review
it.
again,
without
an
opinion,
it
was
denied.
so,
it
went
to
court
on
the
basis
of
two
of
the
commissioners
finally
voting
to
grant
and
we
submit
on
the
conditions
that
violated
the
basic
rules
of
fairness.
now,
we
submit,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
proper
standard
of
review
is
found
in
examining
section
706
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
its
entirety.
it's
not
necessary
to
decide
whether
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
is
more
strict
as
alleged
than
a
substantial
evidence
test.
some
text
writers
will
say
just
the
opposite,
but
it's
not
involved
in
this
proceeding.
it's
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
make
that
decision.
it's
also
not
necessary
for
any
court
to
compartmentalize
its
findings
that
this
is
a
subsection
(a)
decision
or
a
subsection
(b)
decision.
i
make
reference
to
the
acheson
case
in
which
there
was
a
recital
by
the
lower
court
and
by
one
of
the
opinions,
there
was
no
majority
opinion
here,
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
but
the
court
went
on
to
set
it
aside,
affirming
the
setting
aside
by
the
lower
court,
not
for
lack
of
substantial
evidence
or
not
for
any
of
the
other
grounds
and
without
specifying
exactly
what
it
was.
but,
obviously,
it
was
because
it
was
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
abuse
of
discretion
or
not
otherwise
in
accordance
with
law.
the
applicants
state,
time
and
again,
“look
at
this
evidence,
by
themselves,
these
facts
provide
a
substantial
evidence
for
the
commission's
findings
of
inadequate
service.”
but,
as
stated
in
universal
camera
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
administrative
procedure
act
put
that
to
rest.
you
cannot
look
at
evidence
by
itself.
you
must
look
at
the
entire
evidence.
the
court
quoted
from
professor
jeffrey
an
excellent
statement
on
this
point.
to
abstract
out
of
a
case,
that
part
of
the
evidence
which
can
be
made
to
support
a
conclusion
is
to
imagine
an
abstract
case,
a
case
that
was
never
tried.
a
conclusion
based
on
such
abstracted
evidence
may
be
“rational,”
but
it
is
not
a
rational
decision
of
the
case
which
was
in
fact
tried.
evidence
which
may
be
logically
substantial
in
isolation
may
lose
its
logical
relevance,
even
its
claim
to
credibility
in
context
with
other
evidence.
we
say
that
the
division,
the
three-man
division,
should
have
given
effect
to
the
entire
evidence
instead
of
saying
“we
will
not
give
effect
to
this
evidence.
we
will
give
effect
to
the
identical
evidence
if
it
helps
the
applicants.
we
won't
give
effect
to
it
if
it's
detrimental
to
the
applicants.”
and,
assigning
a
reason,
that
is
to
say
like
the
evidence
relates
to
specific
shippers,
which
was
equally
applicable
to
all
of
the
evidence
that
they
did
give
effect
to.
all
in
the
world,
the
court
here
was
talking
about
is
fairness.
the
division
did
not
treat
these
parties
with
fairness
and,
as
a
result,
the
public
--
it
would
be
damaged
under
this
decision.
instead
of
saying
“we
are
going
to
grant
three
more
carriers
from
atlanta
to
dallas,”
as
i
really
believe
the
division
thought
that
they
were
doing.
what
they
would
be
doing
was
increasing
to
16
to
19.
instead
of
putting
an
additional
carrier
to
an
operation
from
atlanta
to
baton
rouge,
they
would
increase
to
7
to
10.
nowhere
in
there
did
they
recognize
what
the
present
service
was,
although
they
said
“we
must
give
effect
to
it.”
now,
the
lower
court
entered
an
order
setting
aside,
holding
invalid,
and
enjoining
the
implementation
of
the
commission's
order
in
the
statutory
language.
that's
as
far
as
the
lower
court
went.
the
government,
but
not
the
private
parties,
then
filed
a
motion
saying
“that
order
is
beyond
your
power,
your
jurisdiction.
you
must
supplement
it
or
amend
it
to
provide
for
remand.”
the
court
says
“no,
remand
isn't,
by
statute
or
case
law,
obligatory.
it's
discretionary.”
no
one
has
ever
suggested
a
remand
would
serve
a
useful
purpose
and,
here,
i
believe
it's
been
admitted
that
remand
will
not
serve
a
useful
purpose
to
the
commission.
this
record
is
old.
the
court
didn't
set
it
aside
because
it
was
old,
but
if
it
went
back
to
the
commission
with
instructions
to
give
effect
to
this
record,
this
record
deals
with
that
baton
rouge
shipper
talking
about
“i
need
a
second
single-line
carrier,”
whereas,
in
fact,
today,
there
are
seven.
it
deals
with
apples.
the
issue
is
oranges.
there's
no
need
in
the
world
to
use
that
and,
as
the
court
said,
it
would
impede
rather
than
facilitate
further
proceedings
that
the
commission
is
free
at
any
time
to
conduct.
we
do
not
go
into
the
field
of
ultimate
decision
of
the
issue
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
phineas
stevens
your
honor,
that
is
pure
speculation
because
it
was
never
argued.
mr.
phineas
stevens
in
the
first
place,
the
only
suggestion
was
the
man
had
to
do
with
jurisdiction.
that
was
all
that
was
suggested.
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
your
order.
it
was
never
suggested
that
you
ought
to
remand,
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
remand,
only
that
you
must
remand
it.
mr.
phineas
stevens
first,
it
says
that
we
have
the
power
to
enter
the
judgment.
so,
that
disposed
off
the
technical
question
raised
by
the
motion.
then,
they
went
further
in
a
very
detailed
opinion
and
gave
the
reasons
why
the
court
thought
that
a
remand
would
impede
rather
than
facilitate
--
mr.
phineas
stevens
what
other
reasons?
mr.
phineas
stevens
that
was
one
of
the
reasons,
yes,
but,
your
honor,
i
might
suggest
this.
it
wasn't
simply
because
it
was
old.
it
was
because
the
conditions
after
the
close
of
the
record
had
changed
to
such
an
extent.
mr.
phineas
stevens
no,
i
do
not
think
that
they
were
saying
that
the
order
cannot
stand.
that
decision
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
age
of
the
record,
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion,
sir.
it
reached
its
decision
without
any
reference
at
all
to
the
age
of
the
record.
it
considered
the
age
of
the
record
only
as
to
what
--
where
shall
we
go
from
here.
mr.
phineas
stevens
the
reason
it
assigned
is
because
the
order
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
not
because
of
the
age
of
the
record.
the
age
of
the
record
question
came
up
after
that
order
was
entered,
and
we
permanently
enjoined
enforcement
of
this
particular
order,
that
is,
implementing
the
order
that
was
before
the
court.
then,
it
addressed
itself
to
the
question,
shall
we
amend
that
order
and
make
it
obligatory
that
the
commission
have
further
proceedings
on
the
present
record
or
shall
we
just
leave
it
up
to
the
commission
as
to
what
they
are
going
to
do?
and,
it
said
that
“we
think
that
the
commission
would
be
better
off
starting
over,
citing
the
cases
that
it
cited
there,
which
the
commission
has
been
free
to
do
at
any
time.
but,
no
one
has
yet
suggested
that
it
would
be
helpful
in
the
further
proceedings
to
test
the
issue
of
present
and
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
obviously,
the
present
situation
must
be
considered.
no
one
has
suggested
that,
in
making
that
determination,
use
of
the
old
record
would
facilitate
the
determination
of
the
issue.
we
submit
that
basically,
here,
the
court
has
cited
in
the
j-t
transport
case
that
it
was
cited.
we
must
give
deference
to
the
commission.
the
issue
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
is
for
the
commission,
but
we
do
not
have
to
accept
the
commission's
determination
where
we
are
convinced,
as
here,
the
commission
has
loaded
one
of
the
scales.
that
statement
fully
applies
to
this.
also,
the
statements
in
burlington
truck
lines,
cited
by
the
court,
that
expert
discretion
is
the
life
and
blood
of
the
administrative
process,
but
unless
we
will
make
the
requirements
for
administrative
action
strict
and
demanding
expertise,
the
strength
of
modern
government
can
become
a
monster
which
rules
with
no
practical
limits
on
its
discretion.
thank
you.
