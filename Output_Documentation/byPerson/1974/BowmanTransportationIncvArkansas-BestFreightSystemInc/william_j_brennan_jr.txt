excuse
me.
i
don't
have
any
1310.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
only
one.

i

mr.
patton,
do
i
gather
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
what
do
we
do,
remand
the
three-judge
court
to
apply
the
proper
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
latter,
mr.
patton,
because
if
in
fact
they
should
have
and
did
not
apply
the
substantial
evidence
test
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
we
act
and
dismiss?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
we?
when
--
is
that
the
responsibility
of
the
three-judge
court
under
the
statutory
standard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
ordinarily,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but,
i
mean
--
here,
as
i
get
it,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
issue
isn't
even
in
the
case,
about
substantial
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
if
you
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
district
court
is
wrong
on
the
standard
it
used,
what
you
are
in
effect
are
saying
is
that
the
fact
that
their
substantial
evidence
is
accepted
by
the
other
side.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn't
raise
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
isn't
your
position,
then
we,
ourselves,
you're
suggesting,
would
have
to
look
at
the
record
and
decide
about
substantial
evidence.
