mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like,
first,
to
address
myself
directly
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
white.
i
have
here
the
complaint
that
was
filed
by
the
appellees
in
the
court
below,
and
when
they
come
to
the
point
of
telling
what
was
wrong,
they
speak
of
the
commission
giving
substantial
evidence
to
--
the
wrong
evidence,
they
think,
and
they
go
to
the
next
paragraph,
substantial
evidence,
no
weight.
going
down,
substantial
evidence
on
over,
substantial
evidence,
substantial
evidence.
now,
they
started
out,
never
once
do
they
--
i
mean,
they
say
substantial
weight,
i'm
sorry.
this
is
--
they
say
they
gave
substantial
weight,
substantial
weight,
substantial
weight,
never
once
mentioning
substantial
evidence.
so
that,
actually,
their
complaint
doesn't
state
a
valid
legal
reason
to
set
aside
the
commission's
decision
and
so,
i
would
certainly
urge
and
i
will
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment
that
the
proper
action
for
this
court
is
to
send
it
back
with
instruction
to
dismiss
because
they
have
raised
no
legal
objection
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
decision.
now,
i
come
into
this
case
representing
shippers
and
in
this
particular
form,
i'm
also
representing
the
three
carriers
who
were
authorized
to
carry
out
the
service
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
authorized
and
which
court
below
took
away.
these
shippers
first
came
into
this
case
after
the
hearing
examiners
had
handed
in
their
report
and
turned
down
all
service
to
everyone.
and,
from
the
very
outset,
the
shippers
then
who
came
in
as
parties
to
fight
for
the
service
then
have
focused
on
the
monopoly,
the
competitive
situation.
now,
this
is,
in
brief,
the
way
i
see
the
motor
carrier
picture
that
they
are
talking
about.
the
southeastern
carriers
come
down
through
north
carolina
and
south
carolina,
all
these
burgeoning
area
of
the
united
states.
they
go
over
to
birmingham,
to
memphis,
and
new
orleans
and
they
have
to
unload
there.
and
then,
the
southwestern
carriers
who
come
in
from
points,
west,
dallas,
houston,
they
come
in
and
pick
up
the
packages
and
take
them
on
to
the
southwest.
and,
what
these
--
and
this
was
kind
of,
i
think
it
was
kind
of
grandfathered-in
in
1946
and
of
course
the
services
have
increased
a
lot
since
then,
but
the
biggest
thing
that
these
shippers.
and,
there's
never
been
a
case
where
there
were
so
many
shippers
came
out
to
testify,
993
shippers
testified
orally
in
this
case,
out
of
1,009
witnesses
who
testified.
so,
you
can
see
how
enormously
important
it
is
to
the
shippers
and
they're
coming
in
here
as
parties,
i
think,
demonstrates
that
as
much
as
anything
else.
and
so,
they
wanted
to
breakthrough
these
gateways.
that's
their
big
argument.
they
want
single-lines
service.
there's
very
little
breakthrough
in
those
gateways
now,
but
--
and
most
of
these
major
carriers
that
come
down
to
the
southeast
and
go
into
birmingham,
memphis,
atlanta,
and
new
orleans,
they
just
stop
there.
they
can't
go
on,
and
what
these
shippers
wanted
was
a
breakthrough
and
a
breakdown
of
this
whole
monopoly
situation
and
so,
we
asked
the
commission
to
face
up
to
this
and
we
took
exception
to
the
examiners
who
said
“well,
we
see
monopolistic
tendencies”
but
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it.
and,
we
urge
the
commission
to
do
something
about
it.
so,
what
did
the
commission
do?
the
commission
spent
about
a
year
regrouping
the
evidence
in
this
case.
it's
set
forth
in
exhibit
e
to
the
--
it's
an
appendix
to
the
opinion.
i'm
sorry,
it's
130-something
pages,
you
need
a
microscope
to
read
it,
but
it's
because
the
evidence
is
so
massive
of
the
shippers
but
the
hearing
examiners
had
assembled
this
evidence
according
to
commodities
and
kind
of
broke
it
up,
someone
said,
atomized
the
whole
thing.
and
so,
that
didn't
show
the
picture,
but
when
the
commission
itself
regrouped
the
evidence
according
to
points
where
the
shippers
were
demanding
more
service,
i
was
quite
clear
where
their
points
were
and
what
the
service
was,
and
it
also
helped
the
commission
in
deciding
which
of
the
carriers
could
furnish
that
service.
so,
i
said
the
shippers
came
in
here
pushing
hard
on
monopoly.
now,
the
court
below
said
this
is
politics,
not
judicial.
well,
i
say
it's
policy
and
that
the
policy
agency
in
this
whole
case
is
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
not
the
court.
i
think
if
there's
anyone
thing
that
epitomizes
what
the
court
did
below,
it's
what
happened
to
the
walter-logan
bill
as
compared
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
president
vetoed
the
walter-logan
bill
because,
above
everything,
it
wiped
out
the
expertise
of
administrative
agencies.
it
had
in
there
the
clearly
erroneous
rule,
and
so
the
president
vetoed
it
on
the
ground
that
all
of
the
expertise,
specialized
knowledge
and
at
least
in
the
agency's
case,
the
uniqueness
was
being
wiped
out
and
all
the
agencies
would
be,
would
be
simply
fact
assemblers
for
the
courts
and
all
the
courts
would
have
to
re-weigh
the
evidence
under
the
clearly
erroneous
route,
by
picking
and
doing
a
bench
trial.
and,
that's
what
this
court
did
here.
it
never
mentioned
or
considered
expertise
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
focusing
upon
the
competitive
situation
in
allowing
the
breakthrough
in
these
gateways.
that's
the
big
thing
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
did.
now,
in
the
court
below,
to
me,
there
are
major
errors.
not
only
was
re-weighing
the
evidence,
and
i
agree
with
mr.
patton,
that's
what
they
did,
but
they
treated
this
case
as
a
battle
between
carriers
forgetting
that
in
every
administrative
agency
hearing
of
this
kind,
the
public
interest
is
a
party
and
the
public
interest
is
the
biggest
interest,
and
that's
the
interest
to
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
responded
here.
they
would've
been
derelict
in
their
duty
not
to
have
responded
to
this
tremendous
out
poring
of
shippers
saying
what
is
wrong
with
the
service
they
have
now.
they
pointed
out
that
it
took,
sometimes,
anywhere
from
2
to
15
days
to
get
their
goods
through
these
gateways.
they
wanted
to
break
down
the
barriers
and
have
single-line
service
between
these
great
growing
areas
of
the
united
states,
the
southeast
and
the
southwest.
and
so,
when
the
court
treated
this
as
a
battle
between
carriers
and
focused
only
on
the
evidence
that
was
favorable
to
the
appellees,
they
didn't
get
a
fair
view
of
what
the
case
is
all
about.
they
never
once
looked
at
the
findings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
to
need,
and
i
submit
that
they're
so
overwhelming
that
no
one
can
say
that
substantial
evidence
doesn't
exist
and
that's
why
they
talk
about
the
weight.
that's
why,
in
their
complaint,
they
talk
about
the
substantial
weight.
they
talked
about
substantial
weight
there
and
then,
in
the
findings
in
opinion
of
the
court
itself,
they
talk
about
weight
in
theory
or
evidence,
superior
evidence,
all
that
kind
of
thing.
and
now,
here,
they
talk
about
treatment
of
the
evidence,
but
i
sincerely
urge
upon
this
court
that
unless
you
want
to
wipe
out
the
expertise
of
administrative
agencies,
unless
you
want
the
courts
of
this
land
to
weigh
the
evidence
of
every
administrative
proceeding,
this
case
must
be
reversed.
i'll
give
one
illustration
of
the
type
of
thing
that
you're
faced
with
and
looking
what
the
court
below
did,
the
very
first
thing
they
talk
about
here
is
the
court
said
that
the
commission
didn't
give
proper
weight
to
a
summary
of
shipper
evidence
prepared
by
one
of
the
parties,
one
of
the
--
it's
not
an
appellee
here,
but
one
of
the
parties
below,
east
texas,
made
a
summary
of
the
shipper
evidence
which
they
said
was
favorable
to
them.
and,
they
say
it's
applying
a
double
standard
because,
in
this
case,
the
commission
looked
at
all
of
the
shipper
evidence
and
found
some
of
it
favorable
to
the
appellants,
but
didn't
say
anything
about
this
exhibit.
well,
for
heaven
sakes,
that's
exhibit
number
1,839
according
to
the
complaint.
now,
no
court,
no
agency
has
to
mention
every
parties
and
brief
that
is
presented
to
them,
and
i
think
the
commission
certainly
didn't
apply
a
double
standard
when
it
went
to
all
the
trouble
to
regroup
all
of
the
evidence
and
to
state
it
according
to
geographic
points
which
there
just
can't
be
any
doubt
that
when
you
do
that
the
need
point
stand
out
and,
i
say,
also
the
carriers
who
could
supply
the
service
stand
out.
the
interesting
thing
to
me
is
that
the
court
below
never
even
considered
the
need.
they
just
wiped
out
the
service
that
these
people
had
come
in
here
to
fight
for.
they
never
even
considered
the
commission's
findings
as
to
these
carriers
and
why
it
was
that
they
chose
them.
so,
i
urge
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
what
the
district
court
did
was,
it
focused
only
on
the
appellee's
evidence
and
it
didn't
talk
about
substantial
evidence
ever.
they
would
say
this
little
bit
of
the
appellee's
evidence,
this
little
summary
exhibit,
was
presented
and
the
commission
doesn't
mention
it
in
its
opinion
so,
therefore,
it
didn't
consider
it.
and,
that's
applying
a
double
standard
because
you
looked
at
the
shipper's
evidence
that
applied
to
appellants
and
you
didn't
look
at
the
shipper's
evidence
that
we
pointed
out
to
you.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
i
think
it
is
wrong.
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
that
they
don't
have
to
weigh
it
to
look
at
the
record
and
find
out
whether
it's
substantial.
now,
if
there's
no
evidence
at
all,
that's
kind
of
easy
for
them.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
but,
in
this
case,
they
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
it
has
to
be
substantial
evidence.
now,
in
this
case,
they
conceded
that
portions
of
the
record,
they
don't
say
which
portions,
support
the
commission's
findings.
now,
they
don't
say
whether
those
are
substantial
or
not
and
our
distinguished
adversaries
here
say
the
court
below
didn't
say
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence.
they
didn't
say
whether
it
was
there
or
not.
now,
we
urge
upon
you
that
the
only
consideration
before
that
court
is
to
take
a
look
and
see
whether
there's
substantial
evidence.
now,
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
big
point
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
and
if
there
is,
the
court's
function
is
over.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
it's
looking
at
the
evidence
to
see
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence.
i
suppose
you
have
to
weigh
it
a
little
bit
to
see
whether
it's
substantial,
but
you
have
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
and
that's
what
they
did
here,
you
see.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
conducted
themselves
as
a
primary
trier
here.
so,
the
peculiarity
about
this
case
is
that
they
don't
even
mention
the
substantial
evidence.
the
court
doesn't.
the
complaint
doesn't.
and,
i'd
come
back
to
the
fact
that
since
they
didn't
initially
complain
that
substantial
evidence
doesn't
exist,
they
admit
that
it
does
and
the
proper
action
for
this
court
is
to
send
it
back
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
because
it's
not
a
proper
complaint.
it
doesn't
raise
a
legal
basis
for
a
court
review.
they
asked
the
court
to
weigh
all
the
evidence
and,
over
and
over
again,
they
talk
about
substantial
weight,
not
giving
substantial
weight
or
giving
substantial
weight.
now,
that
is
not
a
proper
legal
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
above
all
on
this
remand,
let
me
say
this.
from
the
view
point
of
the
shippers,
this
case
has
been
underway
since
1965.
if
this
case
is
sent
back
to
the
court
or
sent
back
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
you
start
that
process
all
over
again,
that
means
that
these
shippers
have
to
wait
maybe
20
years
because
if
there's
any
one
thing
that's
demonstrated
in
this
record,
that
is
that
people
who
don't
want
a
particular
service
can
stymie
things
within
the
administrative
process
of
the
administrative
--
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
a
long,
long
time.
and,
we
feel
that
this
court
in
its
administrative
capacity,
looking
at
justice
in
this
country,
i
would
say
there
ought
to
be
an
end
sometime
and
that
the
time
has
come
when
the
public
interest
should
be
paramount
rather
than
the
interest
of
these
people
who
are
disturbed
simply
because
they
didn't
get
--
they
were
not
chosen
to
render
the
new
service
or
because
it
might
interfere
a
little
bit
competitively
with
them,
and
we
say
to
you
that
these
people,
four
times,
argued
all
of
their
points
before
the
commission.
their
biggest
point,
i
suppose,
is
that
there'd
been
a
lot
of
changes
in
service.
it's
increased
during
the
pendency
of
this
case,
but
the
commission
considered
all
of
that,
specifically
in
exhibit
g
it
listed
the
--
increases
in
footnotes
and
in
their
summary
of
the
pleadings,
it
listed
it.
so,
the
commission
considered
all
of
that.
and
--
so
then,
when
you
come
to
their
claim
that
you
don't
need
it
because
of
these
mini
services
that
have
come
along
since
then,
well,
the
commission
said
it
considered
all
of
that.
they
talk
about
taking
business
away
from
existing
carriers.
that's
bad
diversion.
well,
the
commission
considered
that
and
rejected
it,
and
it
ought
to
know
what
it's
talking
about.
it
said
that
demand
for
this
service
is
so
great
that
a
little
bit
of
diversion
is
not
going
to
matter
and
that
these
people
would
do
their
job
and
furnish
the
service.
they're
not
going
to
lose
out
in
competition
with
other
carriers
and
after
all,
competition
is
a
light
blood
of
this
nation.
so,
i
don't
apologize
for
having
raised
the
issue
of
monopoly
and
competition
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
fought
it
on
through
to
this
court
because
this
court
has
in
a
number
of
cases,
said
that
antitrust
competitive
monopoly
principles
do
apply
in
motor
carrier
cases.
and
so,
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
that
you
not
simply
reverse,
but
that
you
reverse
with
instructions
to
dismiss
because
there's
got
to
be
an
end
to
litigation
sometime,
and
10
years
is
enough.
to
make
these
people
wait
even
another
year
is
too
much
after
waiting
10
years.
there
has
never
been
so
many
shippers
come
out
to
demand
service
in
the
history
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
again
say
they
would've
been
derelict
in
their
duty
if
they
hadn't
found
that
the
paramount
public
interest,
not
the
interest
of
these
various
carriers
who
were
fighting
among
themselves
but
the
paramount
public
interest,
demands
this
service
and
that
this
court
should,
really
in
the
public
interest,
order
that
that
service
be
put
into
effect
as
quickly
as
possible.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
thank
you,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
frankly,
in
view
of
the
concession
by
counsel
that
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
were
not
in
issue
here
or
in
the
court
below
or
in
the
complaint,
i
really
see
no
useful
purpose
that
i
could
perform
by
re-arguing
the
evidence
to
this
court.
so,
everything
that
my
distinguished
adversary
has
said,
he
argued
over
and
over
again
to
the
commission.
everything
has
been
updated
several
times.
so,
unless
some
member
of
the
court
has
questions
that
they
would
like
me
to
answer,
i
don't
see
--
i
say,
what
useful
purpose
i
could
perform
by
talking
about
findings
that
are
not
an
issue.
that's
--
the
whole
case,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
is
over.
and,
i
would
simply
urge
that,
under
the
circumstances,
the
court
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
dismiss.
i
don't
see
how
there's
any
other
alternative.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
in
our
reply
brief
we
point
out
that
the
commission,
at
the
time
of
its
decision
based
its
official
notice
on
one
document
that
was
a
1971
document
and
what
they're
talking
about
on
the
closing
is
a
1972
document
but,
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
they're
really
talking
about
is
agency
discontinuances
and
consolidations
done
by
red
ball.
that
isn't
a
major
thing
in
this
case
at
all.
and
so
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
again,
they
did
that,
yes.
but,
they
were
talking
about--
they
took
official
notice
of
this
and
they
took
official
notice
of
that.
so,
they
took
official
notice
of
the
facts
as
they
were
as
of
the
time
of
their
decision.
i
really
don't
think
that
is
a
major
part
of
their
decision
because,
as
i
said
before,
the
commission
regrouped
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
these
933
witnesses,
according
to
geographic
points
which
made
the
service
stand
out
that
was
needed.
that
was
a
big
issue
here
and,
after
that
was
done,
they
take
a
look
at
the
points
that
needed
service
and
that's
how
they
selected
the
three
carriers.
they
just
fitted
into
that
picture.
they
could
best
serve
those
points.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
your
honor,
the
commission's
order
is
not
based
on
one
line.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
exhibit
g,
every
increase
in
service
is
listed
there
and
if
your
honor
will
look
at
exhibit
d,
every
increase
in
service
is
mentioned
there.
and,
the
commission
said
“sure,
all
of
these
arguments
about
increased
service
were
argued
all
the
way
through,”
and
they
say
“in
spite
of
all
of
this,
we
find
that
the
public
interest
requires
this
new
service.”
and
so,
i
think
that
since
the
commission,
the
great
expert
in
this
whole
area
has
held
that
additional
service
and
particularly
breakthrough
service
through
the
gateway,
sure,
there
was
one
or
two
before
this
started
that
went
through
the
gateway
and
there
was
probably
one
or
two
more
that
had
increased,
but
getting
through
those
gateways
was
an
enormous
breakthrough
for
the
shippers
that
are
involved
here.
so,
i
say,
i
don't
really
want
to
re-argue
my
evidence
but
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
every
point
that
was
raised
here
the
commission
considered
and
it
was
the
one
to
consider
it.
it
did.
they
don't
challenge
their
findings.
i
really
don't
know
what
else
i
could
say.
so,
thank
you
very
much.
