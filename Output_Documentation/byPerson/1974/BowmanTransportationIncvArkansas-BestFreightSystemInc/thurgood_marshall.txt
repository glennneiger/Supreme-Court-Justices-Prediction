do
we
have
to
read
this
42,000
pages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
substantial
evidence
of
need
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
ask
you
if
there
were
other
evidence.
i
ask
was
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
of
need.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
wasn't
it
substantial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
disagree
with
their
finding.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
it
was.
are
you
substituting
your
judgment
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
sound
like
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
statement
do
you
have
that
says
that,
that
that's
what
the
court
did
--
that's
what
the
commission
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
pardon
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
understand
one
word
of
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
understand
one
word
of
that,
in
answer
to
my
question.
aren't
you
really
putting
your
judgment
over
the
commission?
if
you
were
on
the
commission,
you
would've
found
otherwise,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
disregard
all
of
the
evidence,
then
you
fall
a
thought
of
the
rule
of
substantial,
and
they
didn't
ignore
all
of
the
evidence,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ignore
all
of
the
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
make
all
those
arguments
in
your
exceptions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
commission
considered
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn't
consider
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
they
do
that
rejected
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
gave
all
that
argument
there.
