justice
byron
r.
white
well,
technically,
you
think
then
it
would
be
--
it
is
not
--it
wouldn't
be
acceptable
just
to
say
the
issue
of
substantial
evidence
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
--
and
that
we
either
have
to
remand
to
determine
it
or
determine
it
ourselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rhyne,
doesn't
it
--
the
district
court
does
have
to
make
up
its
own
mind
as
to
whether
there's
substantial
evidence,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
just
some
evidence
isn't
enough,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
there's
some
suggestion
in
your
argument
that
it's
wrong
for
the
district
court
to
weigh
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they've
got
to
decide
whether
it's
substantial.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
any
evidence
isn't
enough
either,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
it
in
the
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
that
--
you
don't
think
the
substantial
evidence
is
sufficient
or
adequate
or
intended
to
test
out
the
conclusion
there's
a
need
for
more
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
--
so,
if
we
disagree
with
the
district
court
in
terms
of
arbitration,
either
disagree
with
it
that
it's
applicable
at
all
arbitrary
and
capricious,
or
that
even
if
it
is,
there
was
nothing
arbitrary
and
capricious
about
this
order.
the
case
is
over,
as
far
as
you're
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you,
would
there
--
would
the
district
court
have
remanded
had
it
thought
the
record
was
not
stale
but
was
current?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i'll
ask
you
the
other
way.
why
didn't
he
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
reason
did
the
district
court
give
though
in
response
to
the
motion
to
amend
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
reasons
was
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
reasons
was
that
they
thought
the
record
was
very
stale.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
so,
i'll
go
on.
do
you
suppose
that
the
district
court,
in
view
of
the
reason
it
gave
in
denying
that
motion,
was
saying
that
whether
there's
--
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
or
not
at
one
time,
the
record
is
just
so
old
and
irrelevant
to
the
current
situation
that
the
order
can't
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
it
put
its
final
--
when
it
finally
said
that,
dismiss
and
enjoin
permanently
the
issuance
of
these
certificates,
it
must
have
had
a
reason
for
doing
it.
