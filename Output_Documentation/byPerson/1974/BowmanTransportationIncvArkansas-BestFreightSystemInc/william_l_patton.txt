mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
sitting
in
the
western
district
of
arkansas.
that
court
set
aside
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
granting
certificates
of
convenience
and
necessity
to
three
motor
carriers
for
service
between
points
in
the
southeastern
and
southwestern
states.
the
united
states
and
the
commission
bring
this
appeal
because
we
believe
that
the
district
court,
erroneous
to
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
overton
park,
has
misapplied
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
a
fashion
which
fundamentally
alters
the
scope
of
review
of
administrative
findings.
and,
because
of
limitations
of
time,
i
do
not
intend
to
discuss
the
prior
history
of
these
cases
in
detail.
that
history
has
set
forth
at
pages
three
through
eight
of
our
brief.
i
do,
however,
want
to
make
a
few
brief
comments
about
the
prior
proceedings.
these
cases
are
now
nine
years
old.
they
originally
involved
10
applications
for
motor
carrier
service
in
the
area
generally
lying
to
the
east
of
houston,
dallas,
and
fort
worth,
texas
into
the
west
of
atlanta,
georgia,
birmingham,
alabama
and
pensacola,
florida.
hearings
began
on
these
consolidated
applications
in
early
1966
and
were
held
before
two
examiners
in
eight
cities,
primarily
in
the
southeast.
the
hearings
consumed
149
days
and
over
900
witnesses
appeared
and
testified
in
support
of
the
applications
with
some
60
witnesses
testifying
in
opposition.
66
rail
and
motor
carriers
appeared
as
protestants
to
the
applications.
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
exceeds
23,000
pages
and
the
documentary
exhibits,
number
almost
2,000.
this
was,
as
the
commission
found,
probably
the
most
extensive
record
ever
compiled
in
a
motor
carrier
operating
rights
case.
in
november
of
1969,
the
examiners
rendered
their
report,
recommending
that
all
of
the
applications
be
denied.
exceptions
were
taken
to
their
report
and
the
case
was
considered
by
the
commission
division
i.
in
december
30,
1971,
the
commission
issued
its
decision
finding
that
present
or
future
public
need
justified
the
grant
of
three
of
the
certificates
and
accordingly,
certificates
of
convenience
and
necessity
were
granted
to
three
carriers:
red
ball,
bowman,
and
johnson.
in
september
of
1972,
motions
for
reconsideration
were
denied
by
the
commission
by
a
2:1
vote
and
a
petition
that
the
case
be
heard
by
the
entire
commission
as
involving
a
matter
of
general
transportation
importance
was
also
denied.
in
october
of
1972,
19
protestants
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
and
approximately
a
year
later,
in
september
1973,
the
district
court
set
aside
the
commission
orders,
finding
that
the
commission's
evaluation
of
certain
of
the
evidence
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
now,
before
discussing
the
scope
of
review
question,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
one
preliminary
matter.
at
page
1310
of
the
appendix,
in
conclusion,
11
of
the
district
courts
opinion
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
1310.
the
district
court
finds
that
the
commission's
decision
fails
to
meet
the
requisites
of
clarity.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
there
are
two
volumes
to
the
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
it's
finding
11,
yes,
sir.
the
court
finds
that
the
commission's
decision
fails
to
meet
the
requisites
of
clarity
and
as
an
illustration,
it
says
that
it
cannot
determine
whether
the
commission
rejected
or
approved
the
examiner's
principal
findings.
the
district
court's
finding
is
clearly
wrong.
the
commission's
ultimate
conclusions
and
subordinate
findings
are
set
forth
in
its
opinion.
its
ultimate
conclusions
appear
at
page
158
to
160
of
the
appendix,
and
its
subordinate
findings
appear
as
follows.
commission,
like
the
examiners,
determined
that
all
the
applicants
were
fit
and
able
to
perform
the
service.
that
finding
appears
at
page
121
of
the
appendix.
the
commission
differed
with
the
examiners
on
whether
there
was
a
public
need
for
the
service
authorized,
and
the
commission's
findings
appear
at
pages
128
to
131
of
the
appendix.
now,
the
district
court's
conclusion
is
based
in
part
on
its
labeling
the
appendices
to
the
examiners
and
commission's
report
as
findings.
they
are
not
findings.
those
appendices
contain
summaries
of
the
testimony
and
exhibits
introduced
in
this
case.
they
contain
no
inferences
or
conclusions
drawn
from
the
evidence,
and
i
think
the
clearest
indication
that
they
are
not
findings
is
that
no
party
to
this
case
objects
to
them.
the
district
court
found
that
they
present
a
comprehensive
summary
of
the
evidence.
we
believe
they
do
and
they
are
not
findings
of
fact.
now,
in
considering
the
scope
of
review
question,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
what
this
case
does
and
does
not
involve.
there
is
no
question
here
the
commission
statutory
authority
to
issue
certificates
of
the
legal
criteria
governing
the
issuance
of
such
certificates
or
the
propriety
of
procedures
used
by
the
commission.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
commission
erred
in
finding
that
there
is
a
present
or
future
need
for
the
service
proposed.
that
is
an
essentially
factual
question
and
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
determination
is,
in
our
view,
governed
by
the
substantial
evidence
test.
our
position
as
to
the
scope
of
review
is
this.
judicial
review
of
the
evidentiary
basis
of
findings
made
on
a
record
after
hearing
is
governed
by
the
substantial
evidence
test.
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
does
not
apply.
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
arbitrary
capricious
test
has
no
application
in
adjudicatory
proceedings.
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
there
are
many
actions
taken
in
such
proceedings
that
would
be
subject
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test,
but
it
is
not
basically
an
evidentiary
test.
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
is
really
directed
at
review
of
discretionary
policy
decisions.
it
is
less
stringent
than
the
substantial
evidence
test.
now,
our
position
as
to
the
proper
application
of
judicial
review
in
a
--
is
best
illustrated
by
discussing
a
certificate
convenience
--
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
case,
such
as
this
one.
judicial
review
would
proceed
as
follows.
the
court
would
first,
to
ask
that
whether
the
commission
has
considered
all
relevant
factors,
and
the
factors
relevant
to
a
grant
of
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
are
provided
by
statute
by
section
307
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
set
out
at
page
95
of
the
appendix.
section
307
provides
that
the
commission
shall
issue
a
certificate
if
it
finds,
one,
that
the
applicant
is
fit
and
able
to
perform
the
service
and,
two,
that
there's
a
present
or
future
need
for
the
service.
as
i've
indicated,
the
commission
made
those
findings
in
this
case.
the
next
question
would
be
whether
the
commission's
findings
as
to
those
factors
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
now,
the
district
court
did
not
apply
the
substantial
evidence
test
in
this
case.
rather,
it
held
that
a
mere
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
not
enough
where
agency
findings
are
alleged
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
considered
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test,
a
more
stringent
test
than
the
substantial
evidence
test,
and
it
clearly
viewed
the
test
as
permitting
it
to
weigh
the
evidence.
now,
appellees
say
that
the
district
court
did
not
weigh
the
evidence,
that
it
simply
reviewed
the
commission's
treatment
of
the
evidence,
but
the
district
court--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
you
will
not,
mr.
justice
marshall.
no
sir.
and,
i'll
explain
--
let
me
explain
why.
this
is
an
error
of
law.
we
think
it's
a
clear
misapplication
for
the
standard
of
review.
in
fact,
the
complainant
in
this
case
never
alleged
that
the
decision
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and,
this
massive
record
is
summarized
in
the
appendices
to
the
commission's
report
and
there's
really
no
dispute
about
what
the
evidence
said.
the
question
is
over
inferences
drawn
from
the
evidence,
and
that
involves
weighing
it.
that
is
something
for
the
commission.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
believe
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
we
recognize
that
this
court,
frequently
when
a
standard
of
review
is
misapplied,
does
remand
for
further
proceedings
under
the
proper
standard.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
would
only
arise
if
you
agreed
with
the
district
court
and
there,
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
case
should
have
been
remanded
to
the
commission,
if
the
district
court
had
been
correct
for
further
proceedings
before
the
commission,
but
that's
--
at
this
stage,
i
think
the
case
should
either
be
sent
back
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
or
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
--
of
course,
the
court
would
ordinarily
not
apply
on
its
own
motion,
unless
they
were
asked
to
review
the
findings.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
it
ordinarily
is,
but
there
are
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
well,
there
are
cases
where
this
court
has
made
some
determination
and,
for
example,
the
illinois
railroad
case
which
is
at
385
united
states
reports
or
cases
gone
on
a
long
time
where
it's
clear
from
the
opinion
and
from
the
things
in
the
appendix,
that
the
decision
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
there's
no
need
to
send
it
back.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
is
our
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
we
don't
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
they
did
not
raise
it,
but
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
that's
correct
because
its
finding,
it
says
a
mere
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
not
enough.
now,
to
be
perfectly
candid
about
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
some
conclusions
in
the
district
court
opinion
which
are
ambiguous,
so
that
i
don't
want
to
press
my
position
too
far,
but
substantial
evidence
was
not
alleged.
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
william
l.
patton,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
now,
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
the
district
court
weighed
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
you
don't
have
to
look
any
further
than,
again,
page
1310
of
the
appendix,
to
look
at
conclusion
12
where
the
district
court
says
the
division
acted
arbitrarily
in
not
giving
weight
to
protestants'
transit
time
studies.
now,
transit
time
studies
are
simply
studies
designed
to
show
the
time
required
to
transport
goods
between
two
points.
14
protestants
submitted
transit
time
studies.
200
shippers
submitted
transit
time
studies.
all
but
two
of
the
protestants
transit
time
studies
were
done
after
the
date
of
the
notice
in
this
case,
and
the
commission
said,
because
they
relate
to
service
periods
after
the
day
of
the
notice,
when
the
carriers
knew
there
was
going
to
be
a
determination
about
adequacy
of
service,
they're
not
as
prohibitive.
they
don't
present
as
valid
a
picture.
now,
many
of
the
200
shippers'
transit
time
study
suffered
from
the
same
defect,
but
if
you
look
through
the
record,
you'll
find
that
75
of
those
transit
time
studies
related
to
periods
before
the
date
of
the
notice.
but,
in
any
event,
this
is
the
kind
of
evidentiary
question
that
we
think
is
for
the
commission
and
the
district
court
should
not
have
substituted
its
judgment.
nothing
in
overton
park
supports
the
district
court's
decision.
we
think
overton
park
makes
clear
that
the
substantial
evidence
test
is
a
more
stringent
test
than
the
arbitrary
capricious
test
and
that
even
out
of
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test,
standard
review
is
quite
narrow
and
that
review
in
court
may
not
substitute
its
judgment.
in
effect,
the
district
court
recognized
that
it
could
not
weigh
the
evidence
under
the
substantial
evidence
test,
but
it's
held
that
it
may
avoid
that
limitation
simply
by
invoking
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test.
and,
we
think
its
decision
must
be
reversed
for
that
reason.
surely,
congress
did
not
intend
to
prohibit
and
weigh
the
evidence
under
one
provision
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
permitted
under
another.
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
believe
--
