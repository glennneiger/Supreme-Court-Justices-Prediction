justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
conceive
the
res
or
res
to
be
here
mr.
clancy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clancy,
there
is
some
difference
between
abating
a
whorehouse
or
speak
easy
and
abating
something
that
sells
books
just
because
of
the
first
amendment,
isn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case
set
in
lima
or
do
you
have
toledo?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
the
allen
county
proceeding,
the
state
proceeding
was
in
lima?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
--
was
their
a
motion
to
remand
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
have
a
right
to
appeal
from
the
order
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
granting
the
injunction
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
a
temporary
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course
you
can
apply
to
an
appellate
court
for
a
stay
and
it
can
be
denied
and
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
don't
have
a
right
to
appeal
in
the
normal
courts
even
if
the
appellant
court
won't
grant
you
a
stay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it'd
be
one
of
the
very,
very
few
jurisdictions
i've
ever
heard
on
for
after
a
temporary
injunction
was
issued
on
the
hearing,
you
didn't
have
a
right
of
appeal.
i
don't
claim
to
know
ohio
procedure
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wasn't
free
to
enforce
its
temporary
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
hadn't
all
these
issues
that
you
raised
in
the
federal
court
already
been
decided
in
the
state
court,
why
should
you
have
enough
doing
relitigate
them
in
the
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
quite
a
part
from
his
filing
a
suit,
weren't
these
issues
litigated
in
the
nuisance
proceeding?
didn't
you
raise
these
defenses
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
as
every
other
party
that
once
litigates
and
once
for
one
firm
and
seeks
to
transfer
in
mid-stream
to
another.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
read
the
community
standard
language
in
the
various
obscenity
opinions
of
this
court
as
mandating
a
jury
trial
in
the
civil
proceeding
where
the
state
doesn't
choose
to
provide
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
do
you
read
the
community
standards
language
of
the
various
opinions
of
this
court
dealing
with
obscenity
as
mandating
a
jury
trial
in
a
civil
proceeding
where
the
state
doesn't
choose
to
provide
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
younger
against
harris
itself,
was
it
--
involved
first
amendment
claims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
anybody
operating
the
theater
again?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
huffman
against
pursue,
73-296,
we
have
a
case
that
comes
to
us
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
ohio.
appellee
is
a
movie
exhibitor
whose
theater
was
ordered
closed
by
a
state
court
under
the
ohio
civil
nuisance
statute.
rather
than
appeal
the
state
court
judgment
in
the
ohio
appellate
system,
the
appellee
immediately
filed
this
civil
rights
action
or
section
1983
in
the
federal
district
court.
and
the
three-judge
district
court
concluded
that
an
ohio
nuisance
statute
was
a
prior
restraint
on
first
amendment
activities
and
enjoined
execution
of
the
state
court
judgment.
on
this
appeal
we
dont
reach
the
merits
of
the
first
amendment
issues
because
we
have
concluded
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
asserted
jurisdiction
over
this
case
absent
a
showing
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances
recognized
in
younger
against
harris.
for
reasons
set
out
at
length
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
the
notions
of
committee
comity
and
federalism
which
underlie
younger
are
applicable
when
a
federal
court
is
asked
to
interfere
with
a
state
civil
proceeding
to
which
the
state
is
a
party
and
which
is
in
aid
of
its
criminal
law.
we
also
conclude
that
these
same
considerations
require
that
a
state
litigant
exhaust
his
state
appellate
remedies
before
being
relieved
of
youngers
restrictions
on
interference
with
state
proceedings
which
have
already
been
initiated.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined.
