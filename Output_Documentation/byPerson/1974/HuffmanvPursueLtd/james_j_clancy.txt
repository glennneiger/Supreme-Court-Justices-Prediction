mr.
james
j.
clancy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appeal
here
in
the
huffman
versus
pursue
limited
places
before
this
court
two
dominant
issues.
the
first
is
the
question
of
the
interference
of
federal
courts
in
state
judicial
proceedings.
the
second,
concerns
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
padlock
provision
of
the
ohio
public
nuisance
statute
as
applied
in
this
case
to
a
theater
showing
pornographic
movies
as
a
continuing
regular
course
of
business.
in
this
case
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
yes,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
unfortunately,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
well,
i
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
well,
that's
--
what
i'm
saying
here
is,
i
would
much
prefer
that
the
second
issue
also
be
decided
but
because
of
other
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
i
think
the
first
is
the
more
important
issue.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
that's
right
your
honor.
the
particular
situation
here,
involved
the
showing
of
16
pornographic
movies
in
approximately
10-week
period.
now
withstanding
the
paramount
importance
of
the
second
issue
that
is,
that
this
court
should
resolve
the
padlock
provision.
appellants
would
urge
this
court
to
decide
the
matter
on
the
appeal
on
points
one
and
two
in
the
brief,
and
hold
that
the
federal
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
courts
below
because
of
two
things.
one,
under
the
interim
or
res
exception,
the
res
was
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
which
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
matter
to
the
exclusion
of
the
federal
court
system.
and
two,
under
the
lis
pendens
doctrine,
pursue
limited
took
its
interest
as
an
assignee
with
notice
and
was
concluded
thereby
from
filing
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
federal
court.
now,
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
the
court
should
assign
priority
to
the
first
and
decide
the
case
on
the
first
issue.
first,
this
nation
is
at
the
present
time
faced
with
an
alarming
rate
of
growth
of
pornographic
theaters.
they
are
in
every
hamlet,
village,
and
township
in
this
nation.
i'm
sorry
too,
the
statements
in
some
newspapers,
they
are
not
in
a
decline.
i
can
explain
why
they
are
not
in
the
decline.
second,
the
public
nuisance
is
the
only
way
in
which
this
vice
operation
can
be
brought
under
control.
and
third,
the
defense
tactics
which
were
employed
in
this
case
if
allowed
to
continue
as
a
modus
operandi
for
defense
attorneys
in
such
cases
will
destroy
the
efficacy
of
the
public
nuisance
approach.
the
opportunity
for
the
defense
attorneys
to
engage
in
a
volleyball
offensive
by
using
the
federal
removal
actions
and
to
federal
equitable
interference
as
was
accomplished
in
this
case
must
be
withdrawn.
it
was
never
intended
by
congress
nor
the
constitution
that
the
federal
court
system
should
sit
in
appellate
review
on
state
court
decisions,
particularly,
when
those
state
court
decisions
were
final.
similarly,
the
opportunity
for
defense
attorneys
to
avoid
public
nuisance
findings
in
state
trial
courts
and
to
provide
a
springboard
for
a
federal
declaratory
judgment
action
at
law
by
successive
assignments
after
they
are
in
court
on
the
merits
has
got
--
as
was
accomplished
in
this
case,
also
is
got
to
be
stop.
the
solution
to
the
above
problems
is
to
be
found
in
the
well-recognized
and
widely
accepted
legal
principles
cited
in
points
one
and
two
of
appellant's
brief.
one,
reaffirmation
of
the
interim
or
res
exception
which
prevents
federal
interference
where
the
state
in
action
is
in
rem,
will
prevent
the
volleyball;
offensive
which
has
frustrated
to
public
nuisance
concept
and
i
cite
here
toucey
versus
new
york
life,
orton
versus
smith,
princess
lida
of
thurn
versus
thompson,
and
donovan
versus
dallas.
and
in
donovan
versus
dallas
is
applied
to
federal
cases,
this
court
said
that,
it
was
a
matter
of
power
or
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
in
orton
versus
smith,
that
was
a
natural
application
or
of
--
or
a
consideration
by
this
court
of
a
federal
court
saying
that
the
state
has
the
power
--
has
a
res
and
it
should
stay
out
of
it.
recognition
of
the
res
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
well,
your
honors,
it's
the
property
involve
the
public
nuisance
concept,
the
tax
of
property
itself,
the
business
location.
in
a
lis
pendens
action,
you're
proceeding
against
the
property.
you're
required
to
precede
against
the
property
all
owners
and
give
notice
that
this
action
does
affect
the
title
and
use
of
the
property.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
that's
the
same
thing.
when
you
padlock
the
building,
you're
telling
them
that
you
are
withdrawing
or
you're
forfeiting
the
lease
for
a
year
as
is
the
penalty
in
all
of
these
public
nuisance
statutes
around
the
country.
they
say
that
your
proceeding
against
the
place
when
you
file
a
lis
pendens,
you
give
notice
to
all
persons
and
assignees
with
notice
that
there's
a
quite
--
there's
a
good
possibility
that
if
it
is
found
that
the
public
nuisance
does
exist,
that
they
take
with
notice
that
the
lease
maybe
forfeited
for
a
year,
and
any
person
either
the
one
who
buys
the
property
or
the
lease
takes
with
notice
of
that.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
well,
there
is
under
the
statute.
very
definitely,
they
can
post
bond.
they
can
prove
that
the
nuisance
has
been
abated
immediately.
if
they're
brought
in
under
the
preliminary
injunction
and
there
is
a
fine
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
no
question,
but
the
court
would
be
forced
to
say
that
that
use
was
entirely
correct
and
permitted.
in
fact,
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
in
the
southern
california
district
in
the
orange
county
courts
which
have
applied
it.
they
have
said
that
if
the
--
it's
precluded
for
the
use
of
lewdness
but
other
uses
are
permitted.
i'm
turning
to
a
consideration
the
three-judge
court
opinion
on
the
padlock
provision,
in
essence,
the
opinion
states
that
even
accepting
the
fact
that
these
16
pornographic
movie
films
were
shown
as
a
regular
course
of
business
over
a
10-week
period
still
the
trial
court
could
not
padlock
the
premises
for
years
of
public
nuisance
because
such
would
be
precluded
under
near
versus
minnesota.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
get
back
to
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
no,
i
just
want
to
touch
--
i'm
just
now
touching
upon
why
the
opinion
itself
and
why
it
is
wrong?
mr.
james
j.
clancy
then
i'm
going
to
comeback
to
the
procedure
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
touching
upon
the
--
my
one
answer
to
the
opinion
is
that
their
legal
reasoning
is
wrong
and
they
asked
themselves
the
wrong
question.
our
remarks
on
the
legal
reasoning
are
cited
from
brumbaugh,
legal
reasoning
at
pages
74
to
77
and
we
further
point
to
the
two
cases
cited
by
us
in
the
appendix
case
a
and
d,
cincinnati
properties
inc.
versus
lease,
people
ex
rel.
hicks
v.
sarong
gals,
where
we
say
the
court
therein
asked
the
property
question
and
devoted
its
legal
analysis
properly
to
that
question.
in
the
people
of
state
of
california
ex
rel.
hicks,
the
court
said,
“of
course
just
as
a
court
order
for
the
incarceration
of
a
convicted
law
breaker
impinges
and
all
sorts
of
constitutional
rights
so
does
the
abatement
order,
the
order,
shutting
down
the
proffered,
excepting
for
limited
uses
as
specifically
authorized
however
by
penal
code
section
11230
which
permits
the
closing
of
the
offending
building
against
its
use
for
any
purpose
for
a
period
of
one
year.”
the
question
is
therefore,
not
whether
the
order
impinges
unconstitutionally
guaranteed
rights
but
whether
the
statute
constitutes
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
state
police
power.
the
court
then
goes
on
to
say
the
provision
in
penal
code
section
11230
authorizing
closure
of
the
offending
property
to
all
uses
for
a
period
of
one
year
while
harsh
is
constitutionally
permissible.
it
then
says
it
has
to
be
remembered
that
to
(inaudible)
abatement
procedures
are
directed
against
the
offending
property
itself.
their
purpose
it
has
been
said
is
to
the
--
in
fact
the
reformation
of
the
property
itself.
in
the
cincinnati
case,
similarly,
they
directed
their
analysis
to
the
proper
question
and
they
said,
“their
being
no
question
of
fact
that
a
business
of
obscenity
was
carried
on.”
the
question
in
this
case
is
therefore,
really,
whether
the
state
may
validly
define
the
operation
and
the
places
nuisance
and
close
it
for
a
year,
padlock
it
on
that
basis.
the
court
then
went
on
to
consider
the
issue
itself
and
it
said
the
constitutional
power
of
the
state
to
abate,
what
is
appropriately
been
defined
as
a
public
nuisance
is
never
been
seriously
questioned.
padlock
remedies
have
been
consistently
provided
for
by
most
states
in
the
areas
of
prostitution,
gambling,
and
liquor
violations.
it
is
not
for
us
to
conclude
that
one
of
the
other,
these
subjects,
vis-à-vis,
the
state's
padlock
power
should
be
classified
differently
than
obscenity.
it
then
cite
mugler
versus
kansas
and
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
no,
not
necessarily
your
honor,
if
you
say
that,
the
public
nuisance
that
you're
going
against
is
the
course
of
business
and
you
limit
it
to
a
type
of
situation
where
the
entire
business
or
that
part
of
business
is
--
the
substantial
portion
of
it
is
directed
entirely
to
purposes
of
lewdness
then
you
have
proceeded
against
on
a
proper
manner.
if
you
would
apply
it
on
the
sale
of
one
book,
then,
of
course,
you'd
be
in
trouble.
but
where
your
proof
and
it's
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
what
is
your
proof
at
the
trial
level?
have
you
established
the
public
nuisance?
if
you
go
in
to
the
trial
court
level
in
the
preliminary
injunction,
you
show
them
that
this
is
nothing
but
an
eight-by-ten
building
room
with
nothing
but
pornographic
books,
devices,
films,
etcetera.
then
you
have
met
your
burden
a
proof
under
the
red
light
abatement
or
lewdness
statute.
then,
it's
a
question
of
them
coming
forward
in
saying
that,
this
is
not
a
public
nuisance
or
if
it
was
a
public
nuisance
that
it
has
been
abated.
it's
simply
--
purely
and
simply
a
matter
of
proof
at
the
trial
level.
now,
if
at
the
trial
level,
if
you
plead
a
public
nuisance
or
a
red
light
abatement
action
and
you
go
onto
the
preliminary
injunction
with
no
more
proof
then
you
made
a
purchase
of
one
book,
you're
in
trouble
or
two
books.
if
you
don't
show
what
is
a
--
course
of
the
conduct
which
shows
clearly
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
house
of
lewdness
or
a
house
of
prostitution
or
a
whorehouse.
it's
purely
and
simply
a
matter
of
proof.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
can
be
applied.
it's
a
question
of
how
the
prosecutor
directs
his
--
a
tactical
evidence.
does
he
show
the
court
that
this
in
truth
is
a
house
of
lewdness?
if
the
court
was
to
fasten
its
attention
on
the
opinion
alone,
it
would
not
get
--
really
get
a
true
picture
of
what
this
appeal
is
all
about.
the
opinion
itself
only
concerns
itself
with
whether
or
not
the
padlock
provision
can
be
provided
--
can
be
applied
in
view
of
near
versus
minnesota.
the
court
did
not
consider
any
of
the
other
matters
which
were
before
it.
so
that,
if
you
want
to
see
what
the
true
nature
of
this
appeal
is
about,
you've
got
to
go
to
the
record
and
to
see
what
was
before
the
court.
the
rec
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
oh,
absolutely,
they'll
come
in
the
court
every
time
and
say
presumptively
as
first
amendment.
the
presumption
means
nothing
when
the
burden
of
--
when
you're
entire
evidence
shows
that
the
presumption
doesn't
apply.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
granted,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
yes,
sir.
now,
the
record
in
this
case,
however,
it
shows
that
the
court
avoided
all
discussion,
of
those
important
facts
of
the
case
which
give
the
case
meaning,
matters
which
were
brought
to
the
court's
attention
repeatedly
in
the
trial
brief,
i'm
talking
now
about
the
federal
district
court
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
trial
brief.
in
oral
argument,
in
motions
for
an
immediate
hearing
on
motions
to
dissolve
the
temporary
restraining
order,
to
dismiss
the
complaint
as
being
a
sham
pleading,
and
dismiss
the
complaint
as
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
and
in
two
motions
for
an
immediate
hearing
seeking
or
remand
to
the
state
court
which
had
reach
final
judgment.
it's
remanded
back
to
the
state
trial
court.
see,
here
for
example,
the
entire
history
of
the
state
court
proceedings
that
were
cited
in
the
trial
brief
and
the
copy
of
the
supporting
papers
there
are
two
files,
there's
an
appendix
to
the
trial
brief.
see
also,
the
lis
pendens
arguments
made
to
the
court
in
the
trial
brief
at
page
13
and
14
and
22,
and
in
the
oral
argument
in
the
transcript
at
pages
33
and
34.
the
argument
about
lis
pendens
completely
went
over
the
head
of
the
federal
district
court.
it
paid
no
attention
to
it.
those
matters
however
do
appear
in
the
--
do
not
appear
in
the
court's
opinion
and
as
to
this
matters
that
i
would
now
like
to
direct
this
court's
attention.
passing
onto
the
action
that
was
filed,
this
matter
began
two
years
ago,
september
of
18,
19
--
september
18,
1972
with
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
allen
county,
ohio,
filing
an
action
in
the
common
pleas
court
against
dakota
and
everyone
who
had
any
kind
of
an
interest
in
that
property,
the
real
property
owners,
the
known
lessee,
everyone
that
could
possibly
be
identified
as
holding
a
recorded
interest.
in
his
allegations,
he
stated
that
the
cinema
i
theatre
which
was
being
operated
on
that
real
property
was
engaged
in
violation
of
the
public
nuisance
statute
and
was
showing
obscene
films.
at
paragraph
70,
alleged
that
for
a
period
of
10
weeks,
the
cinema
i
theatre
had
consistently
shown
obscene
pictures
and
then
recited
in
detail
not
as
an
--
an
application
for
a
search
warrant
at
lee
art
theatre
versus
virginia
where
they
just
said,
“we
have
seen
an
obscene
film
and
this
is
it,
we
want
to
pick
it
up.”
he
said,
“these
are
the
films
that
were
shown.
this
is
a
period
they
were
shown
and
this
is
what
they
show.”
they
described
in
detail
what
the
films
were
and
in
addition
at
the
paragraph
--
in
the
same
paragraph,
incorporated
by
reference,
time
motion
studies
of
approximately
10,000
photographs
which
made
a
time
motion
analysis
of
what
goes
--
what
was
depicted
in
those
films.
it
went
on
to
allege
at
paragraph
10,
that
the
exhibition
of
the
said
motion
picture
films
at
the
cinema
i
here
and
above
alleged
constitutes
a
public
nuisance
as
described
in
the
public
nuisance
statute,
state
of
ohio.
he
then
went
on
further
to
say
that
for
the
following
reason
and
explained
what
depictions
were
in
violation
of
these
--
specific
depictions
were
in
violation
of
the
state
statutes
and
those
are
recited
in
detail
at
pages,
c
pages,
c
12
through
c
13
of
the
appendix.
now,
having
stated
what
the
films
were,
what
they
--
having
shown
pictorially
what
they
were,
having
described
the
acts
which
were
contained
therein
which
were
in
violation
of
the
state
law,
he
then
asked
for
the
following
prayer
that
the
nuisance
before
it
was
abated
by
order
of
the
court
and
that
the
defendants
and
all
of
them,
and
all
persons
acting
by
or
through
them
be
restrained
from
exhibiting
said
motion
picture
films
in
the
state
of
ohio.
at
the
same
time,
having
filed
the
civil
action,
he
asked
for
a
provision
or
remedy
which
is
allowed
under
the
statute
and
that
is
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
if
filed,
the
hearing
must
be
had
within
10
days
and
upon
five
days
notice.
he
did
file
the
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
matter
did
come
up
for
a
hearing
which
time
the
court
viewed
four
films
which
had
been
under
subpoena.
the
court
viewed
the
entire
four
films
and
on
october
the
24th,
issued
and
this
was
in
an
adversary
hearing
in
which
the
defense
counsel
appeared,
and
responded
and
provided
and
offered
their
defense.
the
court
issued
--
filed
its
order
in
october
the
24th
in
which
he
said
that
the
nuisance
does
exist
as
alleged
by
the
prosecutor.
he
then
ordered
the
cinema
i
theatre
closed
forthwith
for
any
purpose
of
lewdness
to
with
the
projection
of
screening
of
lewd,
indecent,
lascivious
or
obscene
films.
but
in
addition,
having
closed
it
temporarily,
he
said
that
the
court
orders
that
the
defendant
shows
cost
if
only
they
can,
why
this
closing
order
should
not
be
made
permanent
as
of
this
date.
having
found
that
the
public
nuisance
did
exist
after
a
trial
in
the
merits,
the
court
under
the
statute
was
required
--
the
defendants
were
required
to
come
forward
and
show
that
the
nuisance
have
been
abated
or
give
on.
and
the
order
on
october
24th
to
the
defendants
was
to
come
forward
and
show
either
that
the
nuisance
had
been
abated
or
wandered
--
come
forward
with
some
other
remedy
you
may
have
under
the
statute.
instead,
the
defendants
marched
over
to
the
federal
court
and
file
an
action,
william
dicota
versus
faren
gaelach
(ph),
the
investigators
involved
in
which
they
pleaded
the
complaint
itself.
so,
they
set
before
that
the
federal
district
court
a
complete
recitation
of
what
was
involved
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
the
federal
district
court
knew
exactly
what
was
in
the
state
court.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
toledo,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
yes
your
honor.
in
this
action,
a
hearing
was
held
before
--
correction,
the
matter
came
up
and
the
--
out
of
that
hearing
an
order
was
issued
by
judge
walinski
interfering
with
the
preliminary
injunction
which
is
issued
by
the
state
court
and
he
ordered
that
the
state
injunction
be
stayed,
insofar
as
it
affect
that
showing
films
which
have
not
been
held
to
be
obscene
or
prior
adversary
hearing.
so,
he
said,
“you
can't
padlock
it.”
so,
at
that
point,
the
prosecutor
went
in
and
filed
a
motion
and
he
said,
he
brought
before
the
court
two
other
films,
sexual
freedom
now
and
shootout
at
beaver
halls,
and
started
another
proceedings
forgetting
all
about
the
preliminary
injunction.
at
the
end
of
other
adversary
hearings
in
which
the
defense
counsel
was
present
and
after
presentation
of
evidence
and
12
additional
films,
the
court
entered
its
final
injunction
on
november
the
30th,
finding
the
allegations
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint,
verified
complaint
true.
and
finding
that
in
--
had
engaged
in
a
course
of
conduct
of
displaying
motion
picture
films
at
the
cinema
i
theatre
which
were
obscene
and
that
the
course
of
conduct
in
the
continuing
exhibition
of
the
films
constituted
nuisance
under
the
statute
he
permanently
enjoined
and
restrained
them
from
conducting
the
said
nuisance
and
he
continued,
he
continued
paying
no
attention
what
the
federal
court
did.
he
continued
his
order,
the
padlocking.
thereupon
in
having
filed
the
final
order,
the
defendants
could've
taken
an
appeal
but
no,
they
left
that
matter
stand
and
they
went
back
into
the
federal
court,
this
time
with
a
different
defendant,
pursue
limited,
saying
that
pursue
limited
is
a
new
assignee.
he
purchased
his
interest
in
november
the
17th
while
this
matter
was
entrained
and
now
he
wants
to
litigate
the
same
thing
over.
well,
thereafter,
mr.
huffman
in
a
series
of
most
and
what
he
moved
for
a
further
relief,
he
was
completely
frustrated.
out
of
that
--
having
filed
that
on
december
the
1st,
the
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order,
once
again
nullifying
the
padlock
provision.
now,
following
that
then
the
prosecutor
went
back
again
in
the
state
court
and
started
hearings
again
and
what
did
the
defense
counsel
do
--
but
he
removed
the
case
entirely
to
the
federal
court
again,
so
the
state
court
couldn't
do
anything.
and
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
there
were
two,
not
one
but
two.
there
was
motion
to
remand
and
a
motion
for
an
immediate
hearing
made
on
december
the
18th,
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
it.
on
february,
two
months
later,
in
february
the
12th,
another
motion
for
immediate
hearing
under
remand,
nothing
was
ever
done
to
it.
that
case
was
not
remanded.
it
was
dismissed
under
the
pursue
limited
decision
and
that
case
now
is
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
addition
on
the
motion
for
--
the
motion
to
dismiss
a
complaint
as
a
sham
pleading,
the
prosecutor
made
the
claim.
he
said
this
is
a
sham
pleading,
you
have
before
you
the
complaint
in
the
trial
court,
you
know
what
the
evidence
was
in
the
trial
court,
you
know
what
has
been
shown
by
the
defendants
under
the
federal
court
order
restricting
the
state
action,
they
continued
to
show
the
pornographic
films.
he
took
time
motion
studies
and
brought
them
before
the
federal
court
and
said
here's
what
they're
showing
under
the
cover
of
your
order
and
still
nothing
was
done
by
it.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
he
took
no
part
your
honor.
he
is
required
to
--they
require
to
name
him
under
the
--
under
the
attack
in
the
stature
but
he
took
no
active
part,
no
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
that's
right.
oh,
i
see,
you
mean
as
in
the
original
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
prior
to
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
no,
i
was
thinking
--
i
was
thinking
about
a
different
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
a
private
citizen.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
or
a
prosecutor.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
yes
sir.
oh,
justice
--
this
honorable
court,
the
history
of
this
line
of
action
which
have
just
recount
in
september
18,
1972,
over
two
years
ago,
those
matters
are
not
yet
resolved
and
this
is
not
an
exceptional
case.
it's
the
modus
operandi
for
defense
attorneys
all
around
the
country.
the
--
there's
carbon
copies
for
this
in
every
state
in
the
union,
really.
and
i
think,
this
--
i
know
from
personal
example
that
the
state
of
california
and
the
county
of
los
angeles
is
in
a
similar
mess
and
this
court
has
just
noted
the
jurisdiction
of
a
similar
case,
hicks
versus
miranda.
now,
the
jurisdiction
on
that
case
would
not
begin
to
recount
the
events
which
are
accounted
--
which
are
occurring
in
the
federal
district
court
there.
that's
simply
a
limited
question
on
peripheral
matters.
i
think
as
i
said
before,
this
is
not
an
exceptional
case
and
i
think
that
the
--
it
is
in
the
essence
that
the
prosecutors
here
have
stayed
with
it,
mr.
huffman
and
mr.
herman,
they
really
stayed
with
it
(inaudible)
through
all
of
the
federal
interference
and
have
pushed
it
along
as
they
have.
in
my
opinion,
they
do
not
--
they
should
not
be
treated
as
they
have
in
the
federal
court.
as
for
example,
being
brought
before
that
court
and
an
order
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
be
held
in
contempt
when
following
this
court's
decision
in
june
of
1973
and
the
failure
of
this
court
to
give
them
extra
ordinary
relief.
they
came
back
and
they
said
to
the
court,
they
filed
another
action
and
attempted
once
again.
they
were
stopped
immediately
on
an
order
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
be
held
in
contempt.
it
seems
unbelievable
to
me
that
such
a
result
should
be
obtained
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
when
this
court
in
1850
just
21
years
before
the
civil
rights
act
was
adopted;
(inaudible)
versus
commonwealth,
the
suppression
of
nuisances
in
juries
to
public
health
and
morality
is
amongst
the
most
important
duties
of
the
government.
it
is
the
principle
of
the
common
law
that
the
king
cannot
sanction
a
nuisance.
the
autoptical
evidence
which
was
before
the
court
below
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
as
a
sham
pleading
etcetera,
brought
to
the
federal
district
court
clear
knowledge
of
what
was
involved
in
the
allen
county
common
pleas
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
--
if
this
condition
is
to
prevail,
then
it
must
be
concluded
the
federal
system
of
justice
is
underwriting
to
put
it
crudely
and
bluntly,
cock
sucking,
and
whore
maundering
which
to
me
is
completely
in
violation
of
my
thinking
of
an
american
way
of
life
and
the
american
justice.
now,
that's
the
first
time
i've
ever
used
those
words
in
my
entire
life
and
you
know,
i
think
it's
appropriate
that
i
use
it
now
so
that
this
court
understand
what
is
occurring
in
the
federal
court
system.
i
say
the
majority
of
this
court
does
not
want
this
to
come
about.
i
know
the
miller
decisions
in
'73
and
the
hamlin
decision
clearly
say
this
is
not
the
way
it
should
be.
they've
cut
the
defenses
away
from
all
of
the
defense
attorneys.
they've
taken
away
everything
they
have
and
i
just
hope
that
they
will
recognize
the
sincerity
of
this
appeal.
and
do
likewise,
and
see
that
the
defenses
are
taken
away
from
--
i
mean,
the
public
nuisance
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
no
your
honor.
i
think
that
its
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
--
should
be
decided
on
the
matter
of
the
res
exception
which
is
a
jurisdictional
matter.
as
i
understand,
younger
versus
harris
has
to
do
with
--
we
have
jurisdiction
but
we
--
you're
not
to
exercise
it.
as
the
matter,
the
case
is
properly
before
the
federal
court,
i'm
saying
that
it's
not
properly
in
that
court.
there's
no
power.
in
donovan
versus
dallas,
this
court
so
held
that
the
power
of
the
federal
--
that
state
court
--
when
it's
in
the
federal
court,
the
state
head
court
has
no
power
to
act
in
that
case.
similarly,
orton
versus
smith,
they
said,
“when
the
state
court
has
it,
the
federal
court
has
no
power.”
and
that
effect
of
this
will
be
to
permit
the
prosecutors
to
take
this
in
the
state
court
and
to
take
it
up
through
the
united
states
without
interference
and
this
thing
has
got
to
come
about
if
this
is
going
to
be
whipped.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
why
--
if
you
abandoned
my
--
i
think
it
does.
that's
another
argument
but
i
would
prefer
to
place
all
of
my
way
down
in
the
res
exception
because
the
entire
body
of
the
law
in
this
area
says
that
that
is
the
law.
and
i
think
that
if
this
court
does
follow
with
the
lies
on
this
matter,
it
has
to
apply
it.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
make
something
clear
about
how
this
preliminary
injunction
issues
and
i'm
reading
now
from
b
(5),
i
think
the
court
has
a
misconception
of
what
happens.
it
says
here,
if
at
the
time
a
granting
a
temporary
injunction,
it
further
appears
that
the
person
owning
and
control
or
in
charge
of
the
nuisance
so
enjoined
had
received
five
days
notice
of
the
hearing
and
unless
such
person
shows
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
of
judge
that
the
nuisance
complained
of
is
abated,
then
he
issues
the
injunction.
but
at
the
time
he
finds
that
there
is
a
public
nuisance
exists,
the
defendant
can
abate
say,
“i've
abated
it.
i
have
withdrawn
the
film.”
now
on
the
case
of
“without
a
stitch”
the
defendant
there
notwithstanding
the
trial
judge
finding
that
it
was
an
obscene
film
continued
to
show
it
and
the
court
said,
“well,
you
can't
do
it.”
so,
i
suggest
that
under
the
circumstance
in
this
case
had
the
defendants
come
forward
and
said,
“we're
going
to
stop
showing
these
pornographic
films.”
they
would
not
have
been
foreclosed
because
they
would've
shown
to
the
--
at
least
they
could
have
told
or
given
some
evidence
to
the
judge
that
the
public
nuisance
complained
of
have
done
abated.
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
said
that,
“if
the
defendant
comes
forward
and
does
not
show
“without
a
stitch”,
then
that
nuisance
has
been
abated
and
the
place
cannot
be
padlock.
but
it
said
that,
“if
there
is
a
finding
by
the
trial
judge
that
a
public
nuisance
does
exist
then
he
must
padlock
it.”
now,
there's
been
at
least
three
cases
filed
in
toledo
area,
one
is
the
“deep
throat”,
the
other
is
the
“stewardess”,
and
the
other
is
“without
a
stitch”.
all
three
of
those
have
gone
through
the
system
and
the
westwood
theater
is
still
in
operation.
it
has
even
--
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
order
stands
that
it
must
be
abated.
that
theater
has
not
been
closed.
justice
stewart
was
asking
whether
or
not
a
state
would
prevent
the
business
from
being
closed.
now,
taking
a
look
at
3767.11
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
in
aid
of
the
statute
37
--
of
--
in
aid
of
the
criminal
law,
3767.11
says,
“procedure
on
nuisance
establishing
criminal
proceeding,
in
a
case
the
existence
of
a
nuisance
is
established
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
the
public
--
the
prosecuting
--
the
attorney
shall
proceed
promptly
under
section
3767.01,
which
clearly
says
it's
in
aid
of.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
well,
what
i'm
saying
that
there's
no
right
to
show
under
constitutional
principles.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
to
show
after
the
trial
court
finds
--
mr.
james
j.
clancy
--
that
“without
a
stitches”
is
obscene.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
the
trial
court
finding
is
the
determination.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
right,
i'm
saying
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
says,
after
the
trial
court
finds
that
“without
a
stitch”
is
obscene.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
there's
stay
from
it.
mr.
james
j.
clancy
yeah,
that
the
theater
owner
has
got
to
pull
it
then.
he's
had
his
day
in
court.
you
got
to
take
it
up
on
appeal.
that's
the
only
thing
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
said.
