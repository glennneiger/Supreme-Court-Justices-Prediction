it
seems
(voice
overlap)
if
we
have
a
--
an
ohio
--
a
case
involved
in
ohio
statutory
or
ohio
procedure
with
a
california
lawyer
on
one
side
and
a
georgia
one
on
the
other?
justice
harry

blackmun
well,
frankly,
i'd
like
to
know
whether
under
the
ohio
procedure
there
is
a
right
of
appeal
here
and
all
you're
able
to
say,
according
to
your
understanding,
there
is
not.
now,
what
is
the
answer
to
that
question?
