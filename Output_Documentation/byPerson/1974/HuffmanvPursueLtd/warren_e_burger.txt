mr.
clancy,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
some
which
way
we
can
go
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
like
padlocking
the
building,
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
no
way
they
can
purge
themselves?

where
was
it,
they
came
in
with
a
--
by
posting
a
bond
and
showing
that
they
were
going
to
run
a
--
build
a
garage
there,
they're
selling
automobiles,
they
don't
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
what
you're
saying
mr.
clancy
that
while
there
maybe
a
difference
between
the
first
amendment
case
and
some
other
kinds
of
cases,
that
once
you
have
demonstrated
the
obscenity
factor,
then
it's
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
as
this
court
has
held
and
it's
like
any
other
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
concede
that
there
was
a
presumption
against
prior
restraint
here
but
you've
overcome
it,
is
that
your
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
proof.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
may
appear
somewhere
in
this
record
voluminous
as
it
is
but
i
have
missed
it,
is
the
state
attorney
general
figure
in
these
proceedings
or
as
each
county
or
district
autonomous?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
ohio
is
like
the
majority
of
the
states
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
control
all
the
litigation
in
all
of
the
counties
and
districts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
in
control.
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
deitch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ordinarily,
is
it
true
in
ohio
as
it
is
in
most
states
that
the
attorney
general
leaves
it
to
the
local
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
--
to
what
extent
was
that
tried
out
to
where
it
was,
the
content
of
these
films
tried
out
in
the
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
they
try
out
the
issue
of
obscenity
of
the
film?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
his
final
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
have
through
the
state
--
they
have
indirectly
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggest,
by
the
state
legislature
having
vested
the
power
to
decide
that
factual
issue
in
a
single
judge
instead
of
a
jury
of
six
or
12
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
situation
right
now,
are
the
movies

is
it
operating
or
isn't
it
operating?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
