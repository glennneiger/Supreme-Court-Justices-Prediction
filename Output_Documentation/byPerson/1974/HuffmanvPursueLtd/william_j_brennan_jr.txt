justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
huffman
interpose
as
a
defense
to
the
federal
suit
res
judicata?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
supposed
that's
the
answer,
the
res
judicata
question,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
defense
isn't
it,
that
either
had
to
interpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
he
didn't
then
i
supposed
that's
out
of
the
case
but
that
doesn't
take
the
younger
question
out,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
your
--
your
position
is
that
the
younger
principles
apply
only
to
pending
criminal
prosecutions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
to
this
civil.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
as
i
understand
it
this
civil
if
that's
what
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
our
proceeding
is
in
aid
of
a
possible
criminal
prosecution,
isn't
it,
under
that
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
in
aid
of?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
first
amendment
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
some
have
argued
that
the
first
amendment
requires
a
jury
trial.
you
can't
say
in
a
civil
proceeding
the
seventh
amendment
has
never
been
extended
to
the
state
but
there
have
been
some
who
have
argued
that
because
of
the
first
amendment
overtones
of
the
obscenity
here,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
first
amendment
requirement
of
a
jury
trial.
this
court's
never
said
that,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
are
you
arguing
mr.
deitch
that
you
didn't
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
with
this
case
because
the
result
was
a
foregone
conclusion
after
the
supreme
court
of
ohio's
decision
in
“without
a
stitch”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
maybe
i
have
the
wrong
reference
that
was
not
in
the
“without
a
stitch”
decision
but
in
another
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
many
events
it's
because
of
that
decision
that
you
went
into
the
federal
forum
instead
of
going
to
the
ohio
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
an
ohio
lawyer
i
understand
but
i
understand
the
syllabus
is
the
law.
