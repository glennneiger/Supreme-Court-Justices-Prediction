mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
firstly
on
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
can
bring
the
action
to
abate
a
nuisance
under
.03
of
this
statutory
scheme,
either
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
a
private
citizen.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
honestly,
mr.
chief
justice
being
a
georgia
lawyer
and
not
an
ohio
lawyer,
i
don't
know
but
upon
an
advice
of
ohio
counsel
that
is
the
case.
briefly,
with
regard
to
this
action,
mr.
huffman
as
prosecuting
attorney
filed
the
suit
to
close
cinema
i
theatre
in
lima,
ohio,
under
the
3767.01
and
following
statutes.
interesting
to
note
--
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
under
the
ohio's
scheme,
a
tenant,
a
pure
tenant
has
no
right
once
a
temporary
injunction
is
issued
to
abate.
has
no
right
to
get
bond,
only
one,
the
real
property
owner
or
two,
a
personal
property
owner.
so,
if
pursue
limited
or
united
artist
has
a
right
only
to
do
business
within
the
theater
once
a
temporary
injunction
is
issued
that
entity
is
foreclosed
pending
a
final
decision.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
state
action.
once
there
was
a
hearing,
a
temporary
injunction
issued.
mr.
dakota
went
in
to
federal
court
because
he
had
no
relief
in
a
state
court.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
not
a
temporary
injunction
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
sir.
and
according
to
--
i
think
at
the
c-22
of
the
appendix,
there
was
a
motion
made
by
mr.
dakota's
counsel
to
stay
the
order,
the
temporary
injunction
which
was
denied.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
1973
in
state
ex
rel.
ewing
versus
“without
a
stitch”
said
that,
“it
was
error
for
the
trial
judge
to
allow
a
motion
picture
to
continue
to
show
pending
after
a
temporary
injunction
pending
appeal.”
so,
if
a
rationale
is
carried
to
a
whole
establishment,
then
it
is
error
to
allow
the
establishment
to
stay
open
or
to
grant
a
stay
pending
final
determination.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
it's
my
understanding
of
ohio
law
that
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
at
this
point
in
time,
when
the
federal
law
suit
was
filed.
it
was
--
there
were
theaters
which
had
been
closed,
i
think
it
was
a
case
of
first
impression
before
the
lima
of
the
allen
county
court
of
appeals
but
the
appeals
court
sitting
in
that
had
countered
and
it
is
purely
discretionary
with
that
court
whether
to
grant
a
stay
of
the
trial
court's
order
or
not.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
let
me
explain
this,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
dakota
was
not
represented
by
myself.
mr.
dakota
in
november
transferred
his
right
to
do
business
to
my
client,
pursue
limited.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
or
i
will
provide
to
the
court
an
interpretation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
legislative
or
judicially.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
on
permanent
injunction,
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
possibly
but
its
position
with
regard
to
younger
versus
harris
that
which
i
--
your
honor
has
been
inquiring
to
mr.
clancy.
his
position
of
the
appellee
in
this
case,
that
now
younger
will
not
apply
--
notwithstanding
whether
it's
a
quasi
act
or
criminal
activity
or
civil
activity,
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
held
this
very
statutory
scheme
to
be
constitutional
based
as
mr.
clancy
said,
“because
trouble
upon
one
motion
picture.”
and
it
said
that,
if
that
motion
picture
is
shown
to
be
obscene,
that
the
court
shall
issue
a
temporary
and
then
shall
issue
a
permanent
injunction.
closing
the
theater,
selling
the
assets
and
permanently
--
well,
for
one
year,
closing
the
premises
down.
upon
temporary
and
permanent
injunction
or
permanent
injunction
the
real
estate,
the
real
property
owner
or
the
personal
property
owners
can
come
in
and
at
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
they
can
be
released
of
the
lease
or
the
personal
property
such
as
a
popcorn
machine
or
book
racks
or
whatever
if
it
is
a
magazine
or
a
bookstore
or
a
theater.
now,
with
regard
to
the
state
proceedings
when
this
civil
case
was
filed
against
mr.
dakota
by
the
prosecuting
attorney,
once
the
temporary
injunction
was
filed
his
counsel
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
had
no
standing
as
purely
the
licensee
or
the
lessee
to
seek
a
bond
from
the
trail
court.
he
did
ask
for
stay
which
was
denied
and
the
question
of
appeal
at
that
point
is
--
i
will
admit
open.
however,
at
that
point
in
time
his
attorney
had
to
make
a
choice.
what
do
i
do
now
to
keep
this
padlock
provision
from
coming
into
play?
so,
you
went
to
judge
walinski.
he
went
to
toledo
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
have
made
the
trip.
it's
about
an
hour
by
car.
the
district
judge
upon
an
1983
action
did
not
stay
or
enjoin
any
criminal
prosecution.
he
did
not
enjoin
the
--
our
state
injunction
against
certain
motion
picture
films.
he
merely
said
that
as
far
as
the
closing
of
a
theater
i'm
going
to
stay
that
portion
of
the
injunction
until
abstention
or
--
considering
abstention
this
is
in
his
order,
until
the
trial
court
has
a
final
hearing
and
looks
at
this
case
in
light
of
near
versus
minnesota.
so,
the
state
was
free
to
prosecute,
the
state
was
free
to
file
contempt
charges
for
showing
certain
motion
pictures
at
that
point
in
time.
this
is
in
october
26,
justice
--
judge
walinski
issued
this
order.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
not
to
close
--
to
padlock
the
theater
which
it
did.
the
sheriff
of
allen
county
went
out
to
put
a
padlock
around
on
the
doors
when
judge
walinski's
order
was
issued.
they
were
taken
off
and
the
motion
picture
theater
continued
to
do
business
under
the
stay.
thereafter
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
for
a
certain
motion
pictures
which
had
been
found
to
be
obscene
by
the
trial
court,
the
state
trial
court.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
sir.
it
was
against
the
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
--
closure
--
purely,
the
padlock.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
once
judge
walinski's
order
was
issued,
the
padlock
was
taken
off.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
as
judge
walinski
said
this
doesn't
affect
an
injunction
against
exhibits
a
through
z
or
exhibit
1
through
45
which
the
trial
court
found
to
be
obscene.
only
against
those
movies
which
had
not
been
adjudicated
to
be
obscene.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
after
judge
walinski
issued
this
order.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
that
was
a
temporary
injunction,
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
then
it
came
on
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
the
temporary
injunction
was
issued
on
december
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
until
the
final
hearing
on
the
permanent
injunction.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
the
statutory
scheme
says,
this
--
this
case
shall
not
--
you
don't
have
to
bring
it
on
within
10
days
or
with
15
days.
it
merely
has
priority
over
all
cases
except
criminal
cases
and
a
few
others
listing
those
cases.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
it
was
still
in
effect
at
that
time
except
for
the
padlocking
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
since
that
time,
the
matter
came
on
for
permanent
injunction.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
right,
but
before
the
permanent
injunction,
mr.
dakota
transferred
the
lease
to
pursue
limited.
and
then
at
the
permanent
injunction
hearing
judge
lieb
not
withstanding
judge
walinski's
order
issued
upon
an
injunction
closing
the
theater
for
one
year
in
ordering
the
$300.00
taxation
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
so,
after
that
permanent
injunction,
pursue
limited
went
back
in
the
federal
court
as
party
plaintiff
and
sued
mr.
huffman
and
noticed
the
attorney
general
not
naming
him
as
a
party
defendant
and
asked
for
declaratory
relief
and
injunction
not
against
criminal
prosecution
but
only
against
the
padlock
provisions
of
3767.01
et
seq.
and
the
three-judge
court
declared
only
3767.04
and
.06
to
be
unconstitutional
that
is
the
padlock
provisions.
and
it
left
open
an
injunction
against
a
named
motion
picture
which
could
be
brought
by
mr.
huffman
enjoining
the
showing
of
a
named
motion
picture
upon
proof,
and
it
left
--
it
didn't
affect
any
criminal
prosecution
whatsoever.
it's
our
position
at
under
this
statutory
scheme,
it
says
that,
“this
is
--
it
follows
a
civil
procedure
and
at
subsection
11,
the
sta
--
legislative
enactments
says
that
this
--
these
procedures
can
come
into
play
after
a
criminal
prosecution.
so,
if
one
motion
picture
film
is
--
the
individual
is
indicted
for
showing
a
motion
picture
film
and
convicted
then
the
entire
theater
can
be
closed.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
it's
in
the
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
--appendix,
your
honor
at
page
b
(3).
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
through
b
(10).
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir,
there
could
have
been
an
appeal
from
the
permanent
injunction.
however
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
because
when
mr.
dakota
filed
his
suit,
when
he
was
the
tenant
the
court
issued
that
the
injunction
for
temporary
restraining
order
and
then
once
permanent
injunction
came
down,
pursue
adopted
in
our
complaint
the
allegations
and
we're
--
were
said
to
be
bound
by
lis
pendens,
then
we
assume
the
same
position
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
it
could
have
--
well,
it
wasn't
the
name
defendant,
merely
served
with
papers
by
the
sheriff.
it
was
not
named
as
a
party
defendant
in
the
state
action.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
i
would
imagine
that
mr.
dakota
could
have
appealed
in
name
sake
only
or
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
merely
the
padlock
not
to
enjoin
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
because
of
the
manner
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
discretionary
aspect
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
technically
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
technically
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
it
could
have
appealed.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
it
chose
the
federal
forum
to
ask
for
declaratory
relief
and
injunction
against
the
padlock
provisions.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
believe
at
younger
is
not
applicable
because
this
is
purely
civil
proceeding
and
this
court
left
the
question
open
in
younger.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
the
matter
we
were
--
as
dakota
was
already
in
the
federal
court,
he
chose
his
forum
where
to
be
heard.
he
could
have
filed
the
suit
declaratory
judgment
in
a
state
court.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
not
pursue
limited
because
i
as
counsel
for
pursue
appeared
at
the
permanent
injunction
hearing
and
judge
lieb
asked
me
if
i
was
a
member
of
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
but
the
federal
litigation
had
been
commenced
before
final
judgment.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no
sir,
the
federal
action
was
started
before
the
permanent
injunction.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no.
there
was
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
then,
if
that's
the
rationale
then
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
--
pursue
or
dakota
would
be
precluded
from
--
if
they
file
an
appeal
then
the
federal
court
would
say,
“well,
you're
going
up
on
the
state
ladder.”
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
not
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
don't
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
do
not
believe
he
raised
that
as
a
defense
entered
in
the
court.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
it's
our
position
--
there
is
a
younger
question
--
the
following
younger
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that's
correct.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
and
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
now,
it
separate
and
distinct
from
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
it
refers
in
the
last
subsection
that
this
is
a
separate
procedure
from
criminal
procedure.
so,
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
court
says,
this
is
a
“court
criminal
proceeding”
then
younger
--
the
exceptions
we
would
submit
under
younger
versus
harris
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
--
are
there.
that
is
a
great
and
immediate
irreparable
harm.
that
is
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir,
the
closing
of
the
theater.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
the
content
of
the
films
with
what
--
at
this
point
in
time
at
the
filing
of
mr.
dakota's
complaint,
at
the
filing
of
pursue's
complaint
to
final
judgment
and
by
the
federal
court
on
april
the
20,
1972,
the
only
procedures
to
my
knowledge
against
the
defendants
in
the
state
action
was
a
civil
proceeding
which
doesn't
allow
them
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
the
judge
sitting
without
a
jury
did
say
these
films
presented
to
me
are
obscene.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that
was
his
judgment.
now,
the
question
is
mere
--
allowing
the
state
to
go
through
the
civil
proceeding,
one
changes
the
burden
of
proof,
and
two
disallows
the
defendants
in
the
state
action,
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
this
court
is
set,
part
of
the
test
of
obscenity
to
be
the
contemporary
community
standard.
so
at
least
this
should
allow
--
that
should
not
be
allowed
with
regard
to
this
case
for
a
judge
to
say,
to
rubberstamp,
this
is
obscene,
this
is
obscene,
this
is
obscene.
we
should
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i'm
saying
that
to
allow
the
state
court
to
padlock
an
establishment
based
upon
one
judge
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i'm
sorry
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
would
you
please
repeat
it?
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
not
--
no
sir.
but
i'm
saying
that
at
least
that
the
members
of
the
community
should
the
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
motion
pictures
not
merely
a
judge
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
in
a
single
judge
for
the
motion
pictures
presented
to
him.but
then
you
get
to
the
question
of
the
over
breadth
of
the
statutory
scheme
and
his
order,
closing
in
future,
in
future
of
the
showing
of
any
motion
picture
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
don't
believe
so.
now
with
regard
to
younger
versus
harris,
i'd
like
to
reiterate
that
the
state
court
of
ohio,
the
state
supreme
court
in
syllabus
four
of
state
ex
rel.
ewing
versus
“without
a
stitch”
and
the
syllabus
or
the
syllabi
in
the
opinions
of
the
opinions
are
the
law
of
the
state
has
ruled
that
the
theater
can
be
--
a
theater
can
be
padlocked
based
upon
that
one
motion
picture
film.
therefore,
to
send
the
matter
down,
back
down
to
the
district
court
to
say
a
way
the
state
court
proceeding,
this
is
futility
because
the
state
court
has
passed
upon
the
statutory
scheme.
and
as
early
as
1971,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that's
correct.
but
the
highest
judicial
body
of
the
state
of
ohio
has
ruled.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
do
not
know.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
it's
my
understanding
that
as
far
as
an
authoritative
judicial
construction
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
if
this
court
says
that
court
is
wrong,
that
would
change.
however,
at
this
point
in
time
until
this
court
says
that,
if
the
district
court
was
said
to
--
this
court
order
the
district
court
to
abstain
or
dismiss
the
case
then
there
would
be
an
immediate
re-imposition
of
the
padlock
provisions
until
this
court
passed
upon
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
on
remand
it
could.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
your
honor,
reading
the
syllabus
four
--
maybe
i
don't
understand
the
import
of
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
--
your
question
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
and
without
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
in
lima,
is
that
what
your
honor
is
referring
to?
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
sir.
i
don't
read
the
opinion
as
that
limited.
it
said
that
film
is
obscene
and
that
film
is
enjoined.
however,
the
statutory
scheme
in
ohio
says,
“the
court
shall
issue
an
order
closing
the
theater
and
selling
the
personal
property,
imposing
a
tax
of
$300.00.”
and
sells
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that's
correct.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
the
property
owners
but
not
the
tenant
who
doesn't
have
any
interest
in
the
property
in
the
theater.
and
with
regard
to
appealing
the
matter
through
the
state
channels,
it
could
be
argued
by
the
state
but
if
the
dockets
being
heavy,
the
matter
may
take
more
than
a
year
to
reach
the
final
resolution
and
become
moot.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
at
the
time
this
permanent
injunction
was
issued,
i
--
we
felt
that
to
go
in
the
federal
court
because
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
an
early
case
in
1971
it
said,
“a
motion
picture
film
can
be
enjoined
and
the
nuisance
provisions
under
these
schemes
can
be
invoked.”
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
so,
based
upon
that
judgment
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir
and
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that
was
part
of
the
rationale
and
once
the
temporary
opinion
and
order
of
judge
walinski
was
entered
staying
the
closure
there
wasn't
--
we
felt
there's
no
reason
to
go
in
to
state
court
and
have
the
state
come
in
and
say,
“look,
they've
appealed
in
the
state
court,
dismiss
it
for
this
reasons.”
we
chose
our
forum.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
sir.
part
of
the
rationale
was
state
ex
rel.
keating
versus
vixen.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
it
was
a
per
curiam
opinion
and
the
court
said
that,
“they
could
enjoined
the
showing
of
vixen
and
apply
the
3767
provisions
which
they
said
.02
et
seq.
which
included
the
abatement.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that
syllabus
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
syllabus
4
says,
“it
--
the
court
shall
issue
an
order
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
--
permanently
closing
it.”
and
it
construed
in
“without
a
stitch”
shall
mean
just
that.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
with
regard
to
the
merits
of
closing
a
theater,
i
think
that
mr.
clancy's
position
is
abominable.
i
don't
agree
with
that
at
all.
how
can
you
label
a
theater
nuisance
and
enjoin
justice
in
near,
the
showing
of
any
motion
picture.
in
near
said
--
it
said
whether
it's
a
rise
of
the
problem
whether
it's
personal
property
problem
enjoining
people.
near
said,
“look
at
the
substance.
look
at
the
substance
of
what
injunction
is
and
obviously
the
injunction
is
against
people,
people
showing
motion
pictures.”
and
if
the
court
feels
that,
it
should
pass
upon
the
merits
as
i
think
it
should,
i
think
the
trial
court
--
the
three-judge
court
properly
passed
upon
the
merits.
i
think
the
decision
of
that
court
was
proper.
i
think
this
court
should
affirm
that
decision
based
upon
prior
restraint
and
this
statutory
scheme
being
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that
the
order
--
padlocking
order
be
stayed
pending
a
three-judge
court
hearing,
just
the
padlock
provision.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that
the
order
closing
the
theater.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that's
correct.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
the
federal
court
on
the
december
1st
merely
stayed
the
padlocking.
it
didn't
order
the
court
to
have
adversary
hearings,
it
said
that
there's
an
injunction
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
if
their
adversary
hearing
is
as
the
motion
pictures
that
injunction
is
not
bothered
at
all.
only
the
padlocking
provisions
pending
the
three-judge
court.
and
on
november
30th,
after
i
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir,
issued
by
the
state
court.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
after
judge
walinski
said
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
based
upon
the
fact
--
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that
order
was
appealable
but
based
upon
the
fact
we
were
already
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
that's
right.
rather
than
go
to
the
discretionary
--
discretion
of
the
appellate
courts
to
grant
us
a
stay
and
the
time
limits
--
that
was
a
decision
made
to
go
in
the
court
based
upon
what
judge
walinski
had
earlier
ruled.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
no,
sir.
i
believe
we
have
the
requisite
great
and
immediate
danger.
obviously,
the
judges
used
an
order
two
o'clock
and
the
theater
is
disclosed
by
three
o'clock
to
be
chained.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
well,
relating
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
don't
believe
pursue
is
operating
in
lima
at
this
time.
i
believe
the
corporation
still
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state.
mr.
gilbert
h.
deitch
i
think
the
theater
is
in
operation.
there
is
one
other
theater
in
lima
and
if
the
argument
is
--
well,
the
theater
--
the
corporation
can
go
elsewhere
and
show
the
movies.
that
theater
was
well
engaged
and
showing,
i
believe,
last
tango
in
paris.
so,
we'd
be
precluded
there
is
but
one
other
walk-in
theater
in
the
town
of
lima,
ohio.
