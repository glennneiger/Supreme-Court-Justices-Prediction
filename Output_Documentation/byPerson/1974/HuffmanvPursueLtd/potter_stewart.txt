justice
potter
stewart
you'll
get
to
the
second
point
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
first,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
is
that
unfortunate?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
circumstances
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
we
do
agree
with
you
on
the
first
issue.
we
do
not
reach
the
second?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
going
to
spend
anymore
time
mr.
clancy
on
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
district
court's
acting
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it
--
essential
question,
isn't
it?
i
don't
want
a
--
of
course
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute,
the
prosecuting
attorney
can
initiate
the
action
or
any
private
citizen?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
the
state
attorney
general,
excepted
so
far
as
he
may
be
a
private
citizen?
justice
potter
stewart
as
in
--
initiating
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
nuisance
abatement
action.
justice
potter
stewart
that
can
be
done
by
any
county
prosecutor
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
private
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
clancy,
you
didn't
--
i
don't
think
i
heard
you
mention
that
the
case
of
younger
against
harris,
do
you
think
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
don't
think
younger
against
harris
has
any
relevance
here?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
doesn't
go
to
my
brother
rehnquist's
question
as
to
the
right
of
appeal.
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
passed
the
ohio
bar
exam
once
and
the
--
unless
the
law
has
change
that
was
my
impression
there
was
right
of
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
something
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
lot
of
stitch
case
did
go
all
the
way
to
ohio
supreme
court,
it
didn't
get
--
it
had
to
get
there
somehow
presumably.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
after
a
permanent
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
if
i'm
not
mistaken
we
have
another
petition
for
certiorari
pending
here,
maybe
is
that
case
from
the
higher
supreme
court
involving
the
same
nuisance
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
statute,
it's
not
--
i
didn't
find
it
in
the
appellant's
brief,
is
it
where
it
ought
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
its
there?
justice
potter
stewart
b
(3).
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
that
--
the
litigant
of
that
case
i
gather
did
not
go
to
a
federal
court,
he
just
went
up
through
the
state
court
system,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
as
petition
for
certiorari
here,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
presumably
if
this
court
should
find
the
question
to
be
a
worthy
of
a
grant
of
certiorari,
we
would
grant
it
and
decide
the
constitutionality
of
it,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
subject
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
our
certiorari
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
a
petition
for
certiorari
has
been
filed
and
is
pending,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
the
very
--
the
fact
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
ruled
against
you,
hardly
in
and
of
itself
makes
it
appropriate
for
the
federal
district
court
to
rule,
does
it,
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
law
of
ohio
which
is
the
law
of
that
state
and
until
or
unless
it's
reviewed
and
they
revised
or
reversed
by
this
court,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
highest
supreme
court.
justice
potter
stewart
closing
the
theater
for
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
subject
to
--
in
a
bond
and
then
the
property
owners
could
come
in
during
the
year
and
say
that
they're
repented
and
they
are
not
going
to
do
this
anymore.
justice
potter
stewart
the
“without
a
stitch”
decision,
it
was
announced
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
on
february
27th
of
this
year,
you
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
that
at
a
time?
justice
potter
stewart
in
--
this
litigation
in
lima,
ohio,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
contrary
to
a
suggestion
in
the
question
of
my
brother
powell
instead
of
a
narrowing
this
business
statute
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
“without
a
stitch”
case,
if
anything
seems
to
broaden
it,
if
i
read
paragraph
one
of
the
syllabus
correctly,
it
says,
“the
exhibition
of
a
single
obscene
motion
picture
is
sufficient
to
render
a
theater
a
nuisance
as
defined
in
revised
code,
no
numbers,
which
means
that
on
the
basis
of
a
showing
of
a
single
picture
this
place
could
be
showed
--
closed
up
for
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
syllabus
four
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
he
told
us
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
your
argument
is
that
you
clearly
within
the
exceptional
circumstances
envisioned
in
younger
against
harris
even
assuming
younger
against
harris
applies?
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
problem,
as
i
understand
your
brother
on
the
other
side,
he
says
that
the,
“going
up
through
the
state
court
system
as
--
gives
him
insufficient
remedies,
assuming
that
he
has
a
good
first
amendment
claim
because
the
state
of
ohio
supreme
court
has
held
that
under
this
statute,
it
is
error
for
the
trial
court
to
permit
the
continued
showing
of
the
movie
pending
appeal.
and
that
was
held
in
this
“without
a
stitch”
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it's
what
you're
just
saying
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
pending
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
pending
an
appeal
from
that
finding
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
says,
“its
error
under
the
statute
to
grant
any
sort
of
a
stay
and
to
permit
these
continued
showing
of
the
film.”
and
reading
it
from
the
37
ohio
state
2nd,
page
104.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
its
error
to
grant
a
stay?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
--
you're
arguing.
