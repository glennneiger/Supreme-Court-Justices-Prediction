in
the
decision
of
the
ohio
court
in
the
case
“without
a
stitch”
this
statute
was
construed
more
narrowly
than
it
had
been
construed
previously,
was
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

well
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
wasn't
the
original
state
injunction
directed
not
nearly
to
films
that
had
been
found
to
be
obscene
but
also
to
any
films
that
might
be
shown
in
the
future?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
was
the
original
injunction,
wasn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
case
that's
before
us
today.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
the
ohio
court
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to,
“without
a
stitch”
as
i
read
that
opinion,
limited
the
effect
to
the
statute
only
to
films
that
had
been
found
to
be
obscene,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
younger
against
harris
applies
to
a
civil
action?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
see,
if
the
younger
against
harris
principles
apply
on
the
civil
side,
are
you
in
difficulty?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
despite
the
right
to
appeal
from
the
permanent
injunction
issued
in
november
30th?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
in
difficulty?
