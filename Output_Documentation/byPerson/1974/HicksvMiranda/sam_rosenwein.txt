mr.
sam
rosenwein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
responsibility
is
to
take
care
of
the
procedural
matters.
i
do
think
that
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
make
a
statement,
a
very
brief
statement
of
the
facts
which
appeared
to
have
been
overlooked
by
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side.
and
it's
simply
this,
what
happened
here
was
that
in
the
city
of
buena
park
that
came
the
news
that
“deep
throat”
was
going
to
be
shown
in
that
city.
unwilling
to
have
that
film
shown
in
the
city,
the
district
attorney
sent
the
two
offices
to
look
at
the
film
in
hollywood
where
it
was
showing
and
has
shown
to
over
8,000
papers.
they
viewed
the
film,
came
back
and
prepared
an
affidavit
which
stated
all
tight
up,
which
stated
that
they
saw
the
film
watched
it
for
60
minutes
and
it
was
nothing
but
one
sexual
act
after
another.
no
mention
has
made
of
theme
or
anything
else,
that's
what
they
saw.
they
then
presented
that
to
a
municipal
court
judge
and
with
the
judge
together
with
the
officers
proceeded
to
the
theater
in
buena
park.
they
went
in
and
saw
the
film,
the
findings
of
the
district
court
below
is
that
they
stayed
there
45
minutes,
did
not
wait
to
see
the
entire
film,
came
out
and
in
the
street,
the
judge
directed
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
and
at
the
same
time
where
a
camera
was
being
--
a
cameraman
was
taking
a
photograph
of
the
scene
ordered
that
the
film
be
taken
out
of
that
cameraman
because
the
municipal
court
judge
was
performing
a
judicial
function.
now,
after
that,
they
proceeded
to
seize
the
film
and
this
was
now
at
about
the
first
showing
on
november
23,
1973.
two
hours
later,
another
print
of
the
film
is
at
the
theater
and
is
being
shown.
they
had
been
told
by
the
district
attorney,
look
for
any
difference,
any
difference
at
all
and
then
you
can
get
another
warrant
to
seize.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
the
police
officer.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
they
had
been
told
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
police
officers.
the
police
officers
had
been
instructed
before
they
went
out
and
this
is
in
the
record,
they've
been
instructed,
look
for
any
difference
and
then
seize
it.
they
now
take
the
same
affidavit,
they
go
and
view
the
film
now
assumingly
now
for
the
60
minutes.
they
view
the
film
now,
and
use
exactly
the
same
form,
the
same
type
form
that
they
had
originally
with
the
respect
to
see
if
viewing
the
hollywood
film
and
then
they
write
in
themselves,
in
hand
their
own
handwriting,
you're
affiant
for
the
state
that
such
film
was
seized
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i'm
on
page
five
of
my
own
brief,
but
they
actually
--
it
also
appears
in
the
findings
of
the
court
and
you'll
find
that
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
anyway
i'm
on
five
--
page
four
and
five
of
my
brief,
we
recited
the
findings,
in
fact
four,
five,
six
and
seven.
i
should
point
out
that
at
the
first
seizure,
they
not
only
seize
the
film,
but
they
took
out
of
the
cash
box
all
the
receipts
of
that
day,
$305.00.
then
they
come
back
and
write,
your
fine
for
the
state
that
said
film
was
seized
on
november
23,
1973
at
approximately
1:30
pm
after
being
viewed
by
judge
smith,
it
was
the
name,
with
the
exception
of
certain
portions
being
edited
different
in
the
first
film
seized.
your
affiant
states
that
this
copy
of
the
film
deep
throat
consists
of
one
additional
act
of
sexual
intercourse
and
numerous
small
changes
at
different
portions
of
the
film
where
this
was
the
second,
a
minute
one
doesn't
know.
they
had
set
60
minutes
of
nothing
but
sexual
acts,
the
first
time
they
look
at
only
45
minutes.
now
they're
saying
they
found
one
more.
that
is
the
finding
of
the
district.
having
seized
those
two,
there's
now
a
third
film,
your
honors
will
recall
of
course
the
decision
in
heller
against
new
york
on
which
of
course
my
colleagues
were
entirely
aware.
my
colleagues
who
are
--
cannot
do
some
things
in
good
faith
and
go
to
the
court
etcetera.
in
any
event
they
come
with
the
third
one
now
and
they
seized
the
third
one,
and
what
do
they
put
in
their
affidavit?
exactly
the
same
language,
not
a
change,
they
don't
even
say
the
third
is
different
from
the
second.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
exactly.
the
pictures
were
the
same
and
they
had
not
seen
anything
addition.
i'm
going
to
come
your
honor,
finally,
to
their
concession
that
they
were
identical,
but
i
just
want
to
point
out
here
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
alright
then
let
me
just
see.
let
me
just
--
and
i
will
come
to
that
part.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
but
these
four
seizures
were
all
done,
we
say
of
the
identical
film
and
in
addition,
some
month
or
two
later
at
the
criminal
trial
and
pretrial
proceedings
for
the
purposes
of
the
trial,
they
conceded
that
these
films
were
identical
and
they
needed
only
one.
there
was
therefore
here
a
massive
seizure,
the
theater
was
closed
after
the
fourth
seizure,
there
was
a
massive
seizure
before
any
prior
adversary
hearing,
clear
violation
of
heller.
now,
your
honors
question
is
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
the
appeal
--
there's
only
--
i
think
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now,
let
me
start
just
from
the
beginning
then
on
that.
you
have
the
selection
of
justice
--
judge
ferguson
by
lot.
you
have
him
then
recusing
himself.
now,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
he
didn't
recuse
himself
because
he
was
biased.
there
is
an
implication
there,
that's
really
unfair.
what
he
did
say,
you'll
find
it
on
page
20
of
the
record
all
he
said
was
that
he
had
been
a
city
prosecutor
in
buena
park,
helped
to
organize
and
the
chief
of
police
there
was
someone
whom
he
had
helped
at
the
point.
now
the
chief
of
police
is
defendant
of
the
state.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
there
was
an
injunctive
order,
but
i
don't
think
i'd
say
literally
there
was
of
course
an
injunctive
order.
they
--
the
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
there's
only
one
really
before
this
court
i
think.
the
amended
judgment,
what
they
did
say
was
that
the
district
attorney
should
in
good
faith
petition
for
the
return
of
three,
in
that
sense
it
was.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
and
i
am
saying
and
i
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
i
don't
think
younger
was
applicable
here,
i
think
this
was
steffel.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
at
the
time
the
amended
judgment
was
filed,
yes
at
that
time
there
was.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
the
state
criminal
proceeding
against
the
two
employees
was
begun
first,
then
came
the
federal
complaint
six
weeks
later;
six
weeks
later
after
service
of
the
complaint,
they
amended
to
include
these
two
appellees.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
and
i
think
that
--
i
think
that's
correct
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
but
those
were
--
those
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
problems
that
were
then
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
for
this
reason,
first,
if
we
follow
steffel,
we
had
filed
first
our
compliant
filed
by
these
two
appellees
was
filed
first.
in
the
second
place,
the
predicate
for
younger
has
always
been
that
one
could
get
a
disposition
of
the
case
in
the
state
court
on
some
question
of
construction
of
the
state
law
which
might
not
be
clear.
here
enskat
they
came
into
the
district
court
and
said,
enskat
has
decided
this.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
we
couldn't
have
i
would
say
relegating
us
to
that
court
would
have
not
resulted
and
the
answer
to
the
constitution.
it
would've
been
just
one
way
enskat
governed
all
courts
at
that
time
and
they
said
so.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
in
which
case
are
you
referring
to?
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
i
assume
one
can
say
that
one
could
go
through
the
entire
situation
again,
but
enskat
had
just
been
decided,
the
defendant
the
appellants
here
themselves
come
and
said
to
the
district
court,
enskat
has
decided
this
and
there's
nothing
that
you
can
do
about
it.
and
moreover,
the
court
found
as
it
was
a
finding
made
by
the
three-judge
court,
that
this
was
a
deliberate
attempt.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
to
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
just
want
to
say
that
the
three-judge
court
found
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
circumvent.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
they
wanted
to
circumvent
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
i
mean
that
there
was
a
finding
that
the
filing
of
this
amendment
to
their
criminal
complaint
to
include
these
appellees
six
weeks
after
they
had
started
that
action
was
intended
in
bad
faith
to
circumvent
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
which
we
had
invoked
and
we
had
invoked
simply
a
violation
of
the
heller
rule.
the
heller
opinion
and
were
entitled
to
the
return
of
our
three
films.
that's
what
before
this
court.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
mr.
justice
brennan,
here
is
our
situation
on
that,
you
have
an
enskat
decision,
you
have
this
--
all
of
these
people
coming
in
and
saying
this
is
a
binding
law,
we
understand
to
be
the
binding
law.
i
might
say
a
writ
of
--
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
prior
to
the
recent
taking
of
this
case
and
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
citing
enskat
hamling.
now,
everybody
and
i
agree
that
the
courts
can
always
change
their
mind,
this
court
has
itself
changed
his
mind.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
the
time
nine
months
ago
when
we
were
there
before
the
district
court
it
had
a
clear
situation
of
an
attempted
circumvention,
it
had
an
enskat
case,
that
the
binding
law
everybody
agreed
that
it
was
and
we
had
filed
our
complaint
first
and
had
not
--
has
invoked
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
before.
and
we
had
a
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we
had
one
other
reason.
i'm
not
saying
that
we
mustn't
show
bad
faith
and
show
harassment
--
i'm
just
saying
that
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
we
simply
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
would
be
purposeless
for
federal
court
to
relegate
us
back
to
the
state
court
is
you've
had
a
ruling
from
the
state
court
today,
yesterday
which
says,
our
statute
as
we
construe
it
is
constitutional.
now
there
the
federal
court
what
is
the
federal
court
to
do?
they
are
asked
by
appropriate
plaintiff
who
says
to
them
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
congress
has
passed
the
law,
the
law
of
the
united
states
and
the
supreme
law
of
the
land,
we
claim
a
violation
of
our
constitutional
rights.
and
we
ask
that
there'd
be
a
declaration
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
it's
a
1983
suit.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
it
did.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
judge
lydick
certified.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
if
this
is
were
to
be
considered
mandatory
and
i
consider
it
directory
not
mandatory,
but
if
because
it
would
--
i
know
but
your
honor
that
it
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
if
it's
not
mandatory,
we
have
a
situation
--
i'll
tell
you
what
the
situation
it's
in
the
record
there
have
been
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
shall
and
may
as
your
honor
know
is
very
often,
vary
in
meaning.
what
my
point
simply
is
we
have
had
a
number
of
three-judge
court
actions
pending
at
the
time
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy,
the
chief
judge
decided
that
he
would
refer
it
to
the
three
judge
court,
judge
ferguson,
judge
ellie,
and
judge
east
and
put
in
there
as
any
objection
to
it,
let
yourself
be
known
that
there's
never
been
an
objection
the
first
time
they
rate
that
is
here
on
appeal.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
but
i
think
that
would
be
another
reason
why
it
was
appropriate
for
chief
judge
chambers
to
point
--
i
refer
as
judge
ferguson
as
one
of
the
members.
but
out
objection,
unless
it
be
considered
mandatory
and
that
would
be
--
i've
never
considered
i
can
visualize
judges
becoming
ill,
judges
incapacitated
for
one
reason
or
another
would
be
i
think
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
i
think
that
this
true.
i
think
in
most
cases
that
is
true,
but
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
that
would
be
ordinarily
be
followed,
but
unless
it's
mandatory
i
would
not
conceive
it
is
something.
now,
i
just
wanted
to
say,
counsel
on
the
other
side
spoke
of
the
declaratory
relief
action
as
being
injunctive
in
character
and
therefore
this
court
has
jurisdiction
and
made
an
incomplete
argument
for
ex
parte
young
etcetera,
but
i
had
understood
from
decisions
like
gunn
and
mitchell
and
others
that
this
court
had
decided
that
if
only
declaratory
relief
was
handed
down
by
a
three-judge
court
that
that
was
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
might
say
that
in
this
case,
where
questions
of
harassment
and
bad
faith
and
so
on
are
being
mooted
one
way
or
the
other,
a
mediating
effect
of
a
ninth
circuit
opinion
might
have
been
a
very
helpful.
but
this
court
has
decided
that
the
mere
declaratory
relief
is
not
enough
to
warrant
an
appeal,
now
that's
all
we
really
have
in
this
case,
all
we
have
is
declaratory
relief
plus
the
direction
to
proceed
to
the
municipal
court
who
have
had
stipulations
before
returning
all
the
money
over
$5000.00
were
seized
and
who
would
assumedly
if
they
asked
would
say
in
the
light
of
the
district
court's
direction
at
the
heller
violation
was
palpable
would
direct
it
to
be
retained
would
give
back
it's
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
it
is,
(voice
overlap)
but
this
court
has
said
that
1253
is
kind
of
a
statute
that
should
not
be
literally
construed
that
are
there
maybe
cases
where
it
would
be
helpful
for
judicial
economy
etcetera
to
commit
the
appeals
to
go
to
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think
this
is
one.
this
court
should
decide
it
wants
to
take
jurisdiction
of
course
as
a
matter
really
of
discretion
policy
whether
this
case
involving
basically
the
return
of
the
three
films
is
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
what
i
understood
from
gonzales,
i
understood
from
gonzales
that
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
at
least
policy
wise
that
one
could
say
that
we
would
not
take
this
thing
because
this
is
not
an
injunction
that
restrains
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
because
of
its
unconstitutionality.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
you
have
jurisdiction
but
i
thought
from
the
cases
there
have
indications
that
could
if
you
wanted
to
refer
to
the
circuit
court.
nevertheless,
in
spite
all
that,
if
this
court
decides
to
take
jurisdiction,
our
argument
is
that
the
district
court
below
improperly
decided
that
it
could
consider
this
case,
that
this
was
a
situation,
a
steffel
situation,
a
situation
of
bad
faith
and
that
the
subsequent
amendment
was
intended
to
circumvent
jurisdiction.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
this
raises
the
question.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
with
a
finding
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
with
a
finding
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
exactly.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
exactly
and
in
addition
with
respect
to
all
of
what
has
been
said
about
the
adversary
proceedings
so-called
in
which
they
went
informed
shock
to
a
judge
in
orange
county,
the
superior
court
judge
who
had
no
jurisdiction,
no
statutory
references,
california
as
this
court
well
knows
has
only
one
way
of
trying
an
obscenity
case
and
that's
a
criminal
trial.
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
you
cannot
condemn
any
property
and
is
so-called
obscene
material
until
there
has
been
a
final
affirmance
of
the
conviction.
they
proceed
to
improvise
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
and
get
the
order
restraining
us
entirely
from
showing
the
film
clear
prior
restraint
and
then
proceed
to
say
we
are
holding
a
hearing
in
which
the
husband
of
the
prosecutor
testifies
as
an
expert
that
has
no
redeeming
value
and
the
judge
says,
"well,
i've
see
this
stag
movies
before
that
this
is
no
different
human
maybe
but
snap
up
every
real
and
get
rid
to
the
whole
thing
and
here's
my
order."
now,
is
that
bad
faith
or
harassment,
we
submit
the
district
court
properly
held
that
there
was
properly
intervened
as
a
result
to
decide
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
but
judge
lydick
didn't
have
before
him
the
evidence.
they
keep
on
saying
the
same
evidence,
he
didn't
have
the
evidence
that
in
the
criminal
trial
two
months
later
they
stipulated.
they
stipulated
that
the
films
were
identical
and
they
needed
only
one.
now,
if
they
need
only
one
your
honor
knows
under
heller
against
new
york,
that's
all
they
are
supposed
to
have.
we're
supposed
to
show
the
film
thereafter
until
they
have
a
criminal
trial
and
convict
us.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
when
you
say
that
--
well,
let
me
just
say
this,
when
we
came
in,
when
we
came
originally
before
judge
lydick
and
asked
for
temporary
restraining
order,
and
by
the
way
at
that
time
they
already
knew
who
the
plaintiffs
were.
they
already
knew
who
the
plaintiffs
were
and
they
waited
six
months
six
weeks.
there
has
never
been
an
explanation
of
why
they
waited
before
they
brought
this
criminal
action
against
them.
well,
when
we
came
before
that,
there
was
the
potential,
there
was
simply
potentially
that
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
in
the
complaint.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
original
complaint.
