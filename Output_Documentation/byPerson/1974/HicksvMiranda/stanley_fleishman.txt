mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
to
the
district
court
holding
in
which
the
court
declared
the
california
obscenity
statute
as
construed
by
the
california
court
unconstitutional.
mr.
rosenwein
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
although
that
is
mr.
rosenwein's
domain
i
know
that
and
i
can
and
i
will.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
i
will
do
that
because
i
was
there.
the
way
we
do
it
in
california
your
honor
is
a
--
you
file
a
case
and
you
draw
by
lot
a
judge.
we
drew
judge
ferguson
at
that
time.
at
that
time,
we
had
a
complaint
in
which
we
asked
for
injunctive
relief
and
for
money
damages.
judge
ferguson
stated
that
he
had
been
the
city
attorney
of
buena
park
where
all
of
this
occurred
that
he
in
fact
had
founded
the
charter
of
the
city
and
did
not
want
to
do
anything
that
would
seem
improper
under
the
circumstances.
and
therefore
he
reclused
himself.
subsequently,
after
the
three-judge
court
was
convened,
we
withdrew
from
our
complaint
all
request
for
money
damages,
so
that
damages
were
then
out
of
the
case.
and
within
that
framework,
where
there
was
no
longer
being
any
money
asked
against
the
chief
of
police
whom
mr.
judge
ferguson
had
previously
represented,
judge
ferguson
felt
that
there
was
then
no
longer
any
reason
for
him
not
to
sit.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
when
judge
ferguson
withdrew,
it
was
assigned
to
judge
lydick,
but
then
as
i
say
the
complaint
was
amended
to
withdraw
from
it,
the
money
damage
aspect
and
again
in
this
connection
judge
chambers
selected
the
court
and
gave
to
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
object
that
they
had
any
objection
to
the
composition
of
the
court
and
no
objection
was
filed
at
all.
so,
judge
ferguson
was
in
fact
the
correct
judge.
it
had
been
assigned
to
him
in
the
first
instance
by
line
and
whatever
objection
that
had
been
in
the
first
instance
by
reason
of
the
fact
there
were
money
damages,
no
longer
existed
once
we
amended
our
complaint.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
it
was
ferguson,
ellie
and
easton.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
and
lydick
was
out.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
statute
was
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
practice
is
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
is
originally
assigned
and
judge
ferguson
was
originally
assigned
to
the
case.
judge
ferguson
was
no
stranger
to
the
case.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
part
of
the
explanation
mr.
justice
brennan
is
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
maybe
a
question
although
i
hope
that
in
deciding
if
your
honors
keep
in
mind
that
judge
ferguson
was
drawn
by
lot,
judge
ferguson
was
no
stranger
to
this
litigation
at
all.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
and
under
the
three-judge
court
statute
then
he
should
be
one
of
the
members
of
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
i
--
yes
that
is
a
question,
our
answer
to
the
question
as
i
have
indicated.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
absolutely.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
ordinarily
jurisdictional
questions
are
not
waived
although
that
is
not
a
universal
rule
either
as
i've
been
learning.
coming
to
--
if
i
may
go
to
the
substantive
question,
mr.
justice
marshall
because
mr.
rosenwein
will
handle
all
of
the
procedural
of
problems.
the
important
question
on
the
substantive
question,
is
whether
the
specificity
requirement
announced
by
this
court
in
miller
just
two
years
ago,
has
any
continuing
viability.
miller
held
as
we
read
it,
that
to
meet
due
process
requirements,
a
statute
must
specifically
enumerate
a
carefully
itemized
list
of
various
forms
of
sexual
conduct,
the
depiction
of
which
may
be
prohibited.
justice
brennan
expressed
the
sentiments
of
the
court
i
believe
when
he
said
that
under
the
roth
memoirs
test,
the
situation
had
become
intolerable,
not
only
because
it
makes
book
selling,
has
it
as
profession,
but
as
well
because
it
invites
arbitrary
and
erratic
enforcement
of
the
law.
there
were
other
problems
arising
out
of
the
vagueness
of
the
law
of
obscenity.
appellate
courts
including
this
court
had
been
forced
to
act
as
a
board
of
census
and
nobody
was
pleased
with
that
decision.
law
itself
came
into
disrespect
because
courts
were
acting
arbitrarily
in
this
area
of
obscenity
because
nobody
knew
what
it
was.
it
was
against
this
background
that
miller
was
decided
and
by
a
five
to
four
vote,
it
was
decided
that
it
was
possible
to
define
obscenity
in
a
manner
which
would
at
the
same
time
afford
protection
to
first
amendment
material
and
give
fair
notice
to
those
subject
to
provisions.
four
the
justices
of
course
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
this
and
that
16
years
of
experience
had
demonstrated
the
unquestioned
that
obscenity
was
in
fact
not
a
definable
concept.
it's
important
as
we
see
it
to
remember
that
at
the
same
time,
that
this
court
abandoned
roth
memoirs
as
unworkable
and
indeed
is
being
vague,
the
court
set
in
motion
a
test
which
it
thought
would
cure
the
vice.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
had
read
that
it's
saying
that
roth
memoirs
with
the
specificity,
with
the
miller
specificity
read
into
it
was
not
vague.
i
have
always
read
miller
and
indeed
hamling
as
saying
that
a
statute
without
the
specificity
in
it
did
not
meet
the
due
process
requirement
which
miller
said
was
necessary
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
construed
it,
oh
yes,
i
don't
mean
--
attack
here
is
not
that's
it's
not
in
the
statute
everybody
concedes
it's
not
in
the
statute,
but
what
was
involved
here
is
that
even
as
it
was
construed
by
the
california
courts
there
was
no
itemized
lists
of
sexual
conduct
indeed
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
the
a
and
b
that
have
been
given
as
plain
examples
of
kind
of
material.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
haven't
any
doubt
about
that.
the
problem
is
this
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
hamling,
this
court
read
into
the
statute,
the
a
and
b
given
in
miller,
in
california,
the
court
of
appeal
and
enskat
said,
we
don't
engage
in
that
kind
of
judicial
legislation.
we
will
not
read
into
our
california
statute
something
that
the
legislature
did
not
put
into
it,
so
that
there
was
no
attempt
made
in
enskat
which
is
the
authoritative
phase
decided
in
california
after
miller
was
decided.
there
was
no
attempt
there
to
say
we
are
going
to
put
specificity
into
the
law
if
it
was
not
otherwise
there,
so
that
there
is
no
question,
but
that
if
the
california
courts
had
chosen
to
give
specificity
to
the
statute
similar
to
the
kind
of
specificity
that
your
honors
gave
to
1461
by
reading
miller
into
1461,
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
but
here,
the
california
court
conceded
that
it
didn't
have
really
conceded
that
there
wasn't
the
requisite
specificity
either
in
the
statute
or
in
the
prior
decisions.
and
what
they
said
in
enskat
was,
you
don't
need
that
kind
of
specificity
because
california
retains
in
its
law
the
memoirs
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
test
and
because
that
memoirs
test
was
retained
the
enskat
decision
said
there
was
a
fair
tradeoff.
we
got
more
than
the
constitution
required
in
having
a
memoirs
value
test
therefore
we
didn't
have
to
get
all
that
we
were
entitled
to
under
miller.
so
that
the
question
comes
back
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
on
its
phase
plainly
is
defective.
it
does
not
have
any
itemized
sexual
conduct
and
the
decisions
that
existed
in
california
at
the
time
that
enskat
looked
at
the
statute
did
not
have
particularization.
what
we
have
in
california
are
generalizations
not
particularizations
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
enskat.
they
said
for
example
that
miller
was
satisfied
because
in
california
we
have
a
hardcore
pornography
test
because
it
had
been
ruled
previously
that
only
graffiti
fictions
of
sexual
conduct
could
be
reached
and
because
nudity
without
sexual
activity
would
not
be
deemed
to
be
obscene.
those
are
the
guidelines
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
say
so,
if
miller's
requirement
of
specificity
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
but
you
also
said
that
miller
was
a
constitutional
requirement
that
as
a
constitutional
requirement
that
due
process
required
that
there
be
specific
sexual
conduct
itemized
either
in
the
statute
or
by
judicial
construction.
otherwise,
i
submit
your
honors
that
the
attempt
to
cure
the
vagueness
by
miller
was
nothing
at
all,
it
was
a
mirage
because
in
other
respects,
in
every
other
respect,
miller
made
the
obscenity
law
more
vague
not
less
vague.
for
example,
in
miller
we
shifted
from
national
standards
which
was
generally
thought
to
be
applicable
to
local
standards.
now,
local
standards
are
less
certain
and
are
more
vague.
in
miller,
the
requirement
that
the
prosecution
come
on
with
expert
evidence
to
prove
its
case
was
withdrawn
rendering
a
possible
for
finders
of
fact,
judges
or
jury,
to
make
determinations
based
on
personal
trade
elections
rather
than
some
kind
of
objective
standards.
in
miller,
there
was
a
shift
to
the
jury
as
the
board
of
census
instead
of
having
an
appellate
court
acting
as
board
of
census.
now,
it's
true
that
boards
of
census
be
they
appellate
courts
or
juries
are
not
in
high
esteem,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
censorship
by
juries
is
less
certain.
it's
less
predictable
than
censorship
by
an
appellate
court
which
everyone
can
look
to,
and
know
what
the
law
is.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
this
court
had
taken
this
case
and
i
have
called
it
to
the
court's
attention
just
about
two
or
three
weeks
ago,
the
california
supreme
court
has
taken
the
case
called
people
against
nisenoff
(ph)
where
that
is
issue
is
finally
coming
up
to
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
nisenoff
(ph)
was
decided
by
another
intermediate
court,
enskat
had
been
decided
by
a
court
of
appeal
down
in
los
angeles
and
nisenoff
(ph)
was
decided
by
court
of
equal
level
up
north.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
exactly.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
exactly.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
has
not
been
argued
your
honor.
now,
after
and
only
after
the
california
court
construed
its
statute
and
found
that
it
did
not
violate
constitutional
requirements,
did
the
district
court
consider
the
validity
of
the
california
statute
as
it
was
construed
by
the
california
courts.
and
in
rejecting
the
enskat
argument
that
there
had
been
the
requisite
specificity,
the
district
court
said
exactly
what
i
was
saying
to
you
a
moment
ago
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
all
that
enskat
said
was
that
the
statute
reached
hardcore
pornography,
graphically
fictions
of
sexual
activity
and
did
not
reach
nudity
without
sexual
activity.
the
court
said
quite
properly
so
that
the
cliché
hardcore
pornography
added
nothing.
hardcore
pornography
has
all
the
vagueness
that
we
find
in
the
term
obscenity.
the
court
--
the
district
court
quoted
the
statement
made
by
chief
justice
warren
in
jackabellas,
where
chief
justice
warren
stated
we
are
told
that
only
hardcore
pornography
should
be
denied
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
but
who
can
define
hardcore
pornography
with
any
greater
clarity
than
obscenity.
in
the
case
of
commonwealth
against
horton
a
case
where
the
highest
court
in
massachusetts
declared
the
massachusetts
obscenity
statute
unconstitutional
in
light
of
miller.
the
same
argument
was
made.
it
was
argued
before
that
court
that
in
massachusetts
only
hardcore
pornography
could
be
condemned
and
the
court
so
that's
a
mere
cliché.
that
doesn't
mean
anything
and
struck
down
the
massachusetts
statute.
similarly,
the
district
court
found
that
the
requirement
of
graphic
fictions
of
sexual
activity
clearly
did
not
meet
the
requirement
of
some
kind
of
a
list
which
would
give
some
kind
of
guidance
to
everybody
so
that
you
would
know
if
it
was
in
the
troubled
waters
and
if
it
wasn't
that
kind
of
conduct
you
were
not
in
trouble.
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
were
many
acts
of
sexual
activity
that
may
even
be
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
which
is
so
innocuous
as
not
to
be
included
on
the
list
enumerated
by
a
legislature,
example
to
come
to
mind
of
course.
since
in
california
we
say
that
it's
nudity
with
sexual
activity
the
question
comes
to
mind,
can
you
reach
a
nude
couple
kissing
mouth
to
mouth,
that
would
not
seem
to
fit
the
plain
examples
that
we
find
in
miller
and
yet
it
would
fit
the
general
language
of
the
california
statute.
one
thinks
in
terms
of
kissing
toes,
fingers,
nose,
neck,
ears,
hair,
breast,
all
of
which
under
the
plain
examples
of
miller
would
not
be
covered
and
yet
which
could
be
covered
under
the
general
language
that
we
find
in
the
statute.
now,
the
attorney
general
takes
the
position
quite
out
front
and
says
that
we
do
not
need
a
blueprint,
we
do
not
need
a
blueprint
of
sexual
activity.
use
the
language
of
the
attorney
general
says,
“miller's
demand
for
specificity
does
not
require
a
detail
statutory
enumeration
and
description
of
all
other
types
of
sexual
activities
sought
to
be
protected,
such
detail
is
not
required
under
roth"
and
then
were
back
again,
would
roth
without
miller
read
into
it
satisfy
the
due
process
requirements
today
in
light
of
miller.
and
i
submit
with
all
deference
that
roth
without
miller
read
into
it
is
unconstitutional
under
the
miller
group.
and
then
the
attorney
general
says,
“relying
on
a
statement
of
this
court
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
ultimate
godlike
precision,"
he
says,
therefore
it
is
unnecessary
that
to
avert
the
constitutional
infirmity
of
vagueness,
the
statute
must
reside
a
detailed
blueprint
of
the
proscribed
conduct.”
so
the
question
that
we
have
here
is,
when
concededly
the
state
statute
does
not
have
any
itemized
list
and
when
concededly
the
prior
decisions
of
the
state
court
do
not
have
any
itemized
list
and
where
the
state
court
does
not
seek
to
correct
the
statute
in
any
fashion
because
the
state
courts
recognized
that
that
is
a
legislative
function
and
not
a
judicial
function
whether
under
those
circumstances
the
statute
was
correctly
found
to
the
unconstitutional
as
it
was
by
the
district
court
and
we
believe
that
the
court
plainly
was
correct
in
its
conclusion.
the
court
stated,
the
district
court
stated
that
this
court
in
miller
set
forth
important
first
and
fifth
amendment
principles
central
to
a
fair
and
recent
system
of
criminal
law
when
it
insisted
that
an
obscenity
statute
have
an
itemized
list
of
the
types
of
sexual
conduct
that
may
be
reached
under
the
obscenity
law.
we
respectfully
submit
that
unless
that
portion
of
miller
is
to
be
overruled,
the
district
court
was
plainly
correct
in
its
conclusion
and
i
would
say
to
your
honors
that
if
that
specificity
portion
of
miller
is
to
be
overruled,
then
we
are
worse
off
than
we
were
before
when
this
court
said
that
roth
and
memoirs
had
created
the
state
of
chaos
because
then
we
would
have
even
more
chaos
than
we
had
before.
thank
you
your
honors.
