justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
smith,
somewhere
can
you
straighten
out
for
me
the
juxtaposition
of
judge
ferguson
and
judge
lydick?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
certify,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
certified
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
certified
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
necessity
for
the
three-judge
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
who
petitioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
there
are
complaints
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
that
filed
in
relation
to
the
day
of
the
filing
of
the
federal
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
were
they
--
are
different
prints
of
the
same
film?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
deep
throat.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
have
mr.
fleishman
of
the
requirement
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
certified
--
judge
lydick
certified
the
necessity
for
the
three-judge
court.
isn't
the
practice
ordinarily
if
the
certifying
judge
is
a
member
of
the
the
three
judge
panel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that's
not
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
find
that
out
judge
ferguson
could've
been
appointed
by
chief
judge
chambers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
statute
may
he
do
that,
isn't
he
required
to
assign
the
certifying
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
we'll
have
to
decide
that
mr.
fleishman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
rely
also
that
no
objection
was
made
when
opportunity
was
given.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
both
sides
i
gather
to
object
and
not
to
the
panel
as
composed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
similar
case
has
not
yet
been
taken
by
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that
--
what
court
have
decided
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
nisenoff
(ph)
court
follow
enskat?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
so
the
very
enskat
issue
is
now
before
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
hasn't
been
argued?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rosenwein
i
hope
you're
going
to
give
some
time
to
whether
or
not
we
have
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
weather
younger
should've
been
filed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
gather
these
things
were
all
irrelevant
if
we've
decided
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
in
this
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
appeal
here
is
from?
what
or
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
i
understood,
if
i
may
tell
you
what
bothers
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
direct
appeal
from
an
order
to
this
court
and
if
it's
properly
here
that's
because
there
was
some
kind
of
injunctive
order
below.
was
there
or
wasn't
there
an
injunctive
order
below?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
speaking
of
the
two
orders
and
what
these
two
have
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
an
adjunctive
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
you'll
agree
and
an
appeal
was
taken
from
that
order
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
next
thing
i'm
interested
in,
if
we
have
jurisdiction
should
the
three-judge
court
had
followed
younger
and
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
a
pending
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
at
the
time
of
any
order
in
the
three-judge
court.
there
was
a
pending
criminal
proceeding
was
there
or
not
in
the
california
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
with
relation
to
the
firing
of
the
federal
suit
was
that
state
criminal
proceeding
begun?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
but
as
after
that,
before
you
had
the
first
judgment
order
of
the
three-judge
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
meanwhile
there
had
been
additional
proceedings
involving
these
appellants
in
the
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
say
in
that
circumstance
that
younger
does
not
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
suggest
i
don't
understand
younger
that
way.
this
is
not
the
classic
abstention
situation
in
which
a
construction
of
the
state
statute
might
avoid
the
federal
constitutional
questio.
that's
not
the
circumstance
to
which
younger
was
limited,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
an
exception.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
mean
that
was
--
it
was
the
finding
of
harassment
within
the
younger
exception
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
fleishman
has
told
us
that
some
other
litigators
exceeded
in
getting
the
enskat
issue
before
the
california
supreme
court.
had
you
proceeded
through
the
court
of
appeals
,
i
guess
the
same
third
provision
would
it
in
los
angeles?
then
perhaps
you
might
have
succeeded
as
to
this
other
litigant
in
getting
enskat
before
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
you're
suggesting
that
means
the
supreme
court
is
going
to
follow
enskat,
but
then
you've
come
here
wouldn't
you
or
try
to
get
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
a
1983
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that's
either
discretion
whether
we
take
this
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
wouldn't
matter,
i
should
take
in
the
place
of
the
statute,
unless
as
an
injunctive
order
we
have
no
jurisdiction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
with
that
situation
is
one
in
which
there
has
no
criminal
proceeding
pending
all
over
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here
you've
got
an
actual
criminal
proceeding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
involves
whether
young
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
within
an
exception.
you're
suggesting
that
it's
a
finding
that
which
brings
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
harassment
exception.
