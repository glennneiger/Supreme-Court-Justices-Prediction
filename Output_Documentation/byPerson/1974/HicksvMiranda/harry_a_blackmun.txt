harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
emphasize
what
mr.
justice
brennan
is
asking,
there
seems
to
be
a
great
desire
on
the
part
of
both
sides
of
the
council
table
to
avoid
this
issue.
would
you
direct
yourself
to
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
rosenwein
are
you
departing
now
from
your
associates
posture,
i
thought
that
he
took
the
position
that
under
the
statute
it
was
judge
ferguson
to
whom
the
application
for
injunction
or
other
relief
was
originally
presented.
