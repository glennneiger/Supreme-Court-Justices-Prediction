justice
thurgood

mr.
rosenwein,
did
your
original
application
asked
for
a
three-judge
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
did.
which
judge
asked
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
the
statute
says
that
on
the
filing
that
he
shall
immediately
notify
the
chief
judge
of
the
circuit,
that
was
judge
lydick
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
shall
designate
two
other
judges
to
sit
with
it,
does
this
comply
with
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
not
mandatory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
shall,
is
not
mandatory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
actually
i
never
heard
of
it
before.
i
know
i
haven't
been
on
any
court
too
long,
but
i'd
never
heard
of
a
three-judge
court
that
didn't
include
the
one
who
asked
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
assume
you
could
call
that
a
statute.
