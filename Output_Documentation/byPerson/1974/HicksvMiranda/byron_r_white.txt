do
you
suggest
that
the
younger
doctrine
is
limited
to
where
the
state
law
or
where
state
courts
having
decided
the
federal
question
that
was
in

but
if
the
state

have
already
taken
a
position
on
the

of

in
74-156,
hicks
against
miranda.
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
entertained
a
suit
to
declare
the
california
obscenity
statute
unconstitutional
and
to
enjoin
its
operation
in
certain
respects.
the
court
refused
to
grant
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
filed
under
younger
v.
harris
and
which
asserted
that
criminal
prosecutions
against
the
federal
plaintiffs
were
then
pending
in
the
state
courts.
the
district
court
also
concluded
that
it
was
not
bound
by
cases
in
which
this
court
had
dismissed
an
appeal
for
a
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
court
then
reached
the
merits
and
declared
the
california
statute
unconstitutional.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
now
reverse
the
district
court.
as
explained
in
the
opinion
we
have
filed,
we
overrule
objections
which
have
been
asserted
to
our
jurisdiction
include
that
the
district
court
should
have
dismissed
the
case
under
younger
v.
harris
and
make
clear
that
the
district
court
was
indeed
bound
by
our
summary
dismissals
of
appeals
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
