did
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
ever
object
to
the
three-judge
court
that
was
actually
convened
that
you
thought
there
had
been
a
jurisdictional
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
isn't
it
conceivable
too
that
judge
ferguson
this
could
have
come
to
me
or
one
of
the
other
15
judges
of
the
central
district
would
say
i
--
there's
not,
possibly
i'm
biased,
i
won't
sit.
then
it
goes
up
and
it's
certified
by
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit
who
comes
back
and
says
you,
you
and
you
will
make
up
this
court.
well,
that
that
thing
is
a
little
further
advanced
along
the
road
at
that
and
you
might
take
another
look
and
say,
“well
in
most
circumstances
as
long
as
judge
chambers
have
said
so
i'm
going
to
sit!”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
the
appellees
in
this
case
parties
to
the
municipal
court
per
se?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
held
in
handling
that
we
had
not
said
in
miller
that
roth
memoirs
was
vague,
didn't
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
mean
written
in
the
statute
itself,
you
mean
construed
in
one
way
or
another.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
there
been
an
itemized
list
in
the
construction
of
section
1461
by
this
court?
if
there
hasn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
been
no
itemized
list
and
surely
these
courts
of
california
have
as
much
freedom
in
administering
obscenity
statue
written
by
the
california
legislature
as
this
court
does
in
administering
one
written
by
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
any
less
of
a
guideline
in
our
construction
of
1461
in
the
reel's
case
and
in
hamling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
said
in
hamling
that
miller
wasn't
a
legislative
drafting
manually
that
you
didn't
have
to
do
exactly
what
miller
has
said.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
might
told
us
to
a
petition
for
hearing
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
at
the
san
diego
court
of
appeals
decided
against
on
your
constitutional
claim,
didn't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
had
you
taken
your
case
up
through
the
california
court
system.
you
say
that's
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
would've
decided
on
the
basis
of
enskat.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could've
then
asked
the
supreme
court
of
california
for
him
if
you'd
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
you
could've
petitioned
this
court
if
you'd
lost
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosenwein,
at
what
stage
did
your
heller
complaint
in
the
federal
court
turn
into
an
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
obscenity
statute
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
did
you
first
pray
for
a
declaration
or
injunction
as
to
the
unconstitutional
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in

original
