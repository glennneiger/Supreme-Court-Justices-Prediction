ms.
oretta
d.
sears
mr.
chief
justice
--
ms.
oretta
d.
sears
--
may
the
court
please.
i
think
listening
to
the
contempt
case
i
have
somewhat
lost
my
voice
but
hopefully
as
i
proceed
it
will
become
clear.
what
is
before
the
court
today
is
a
many
issued
case,
however,
i
do
believe
that
the
court
indicated
by
the
postponement
of
the
jurisdiction
to
this
day
that
it
wish
to
hear
argument
on
whether
or
not
there
was
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
in
directing
myself
to
that
issue,
i
would
like
to
proceed
by
arguing
that
both
of
the
orders
issued
by
the
court
below,
be
it
the
order
of
june
4th
which
required
the
people
to
return
the
movies
or
the
films
and
the
order
of
due
of
september
30th
which
ordered
the
--
defendant
--
defendants
in
“good
faith”
petitioned
the
state
court
for
the
return
of
the
film
are
injunctive
in
determining.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
sense
in
an
action
that
involves
a
state
statute
is
to
my
way
of
thinking
per
se
injunctive
within
the
context
of
1253,
within
the
context
of
2281
and
2283.
a
look
at
the
birth
of
these
statutes
brings
us
back
to
ex
parte
young.
but
when
i
read
the
ex
parte
young
and
i
started
from
there
and
i
went
back
and
reread
a
lot
of
the
very
brilliant
decisions
by
members
of
this
court
and
by
past
members
of
the
court,
i
was
impressed
by
one
thing,
that
what
ex
parte
young
dealt
with
was
one
portion
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
not
really,
not
at
all,
the
portion
of
whether
or
not
the
court
or
the
judicial,
the
federal
court
per
se
as
the
judicial
system
had
jurisdiction
over
seven
causes
of
actions.
for
indeed
that's
the
first
portion
of
the
amendment
but
what
that
case
dealt
with
i
think
is
expressed
best
in
the
--
in
justice
harlan's
dissent.
it
dealt
with
that
second
portion
which
said,
”and
in
those
cases
in
which
a
state
is
a
party,
jurisdiction
--
original
jurisdiction
shall
be
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.”
it
was
that
second
limitation
that
was
argued
in
that
case.
the
question
was
when
there
is
a
state
statute
that
is
at
that
through
the
attorney
general
or
through
the
state
personnel
representative
is
it
the
state
that's
being
attacked
or
is
the
individual
and
the
majority
with
an
opinion
--
ms.
oretta
d.
sears
yes.
what
i
was
trying
to
or
attempting
to
point
out
is
that
in
a
very
real
sense
what
ex
parte
young
did
was
to
take
away
a
suit
against
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
or
state
officer
in
which
the
declaration
or
a
statute
is
being
attacked
for
unconstitutionality
from
the
original
jurisdiction
provision
inherent
in
the
constitution
which
states
that
whenever
the
state
is
a
party
to
a
proceeding
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
is
original
jurisdiction.
it
was
to
remedy
this
particular
ill
that
in
1911
the
original
three-judge
court
provisions
were
enacted.
i
think
the
--
probably
the
clearest
showing
of
the
intent
of
congress
at
that
time
to
provide
full
direct
appeal
in
all
of
those
cases
where
a
decision
was
to
be
made
by
the
three-judge
court
and
where
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
was
added,
is
found
in
the
original
provision
in
1911th
provision
in
which
the
three-judge
court
which
was
sought
to
be
a
panel
was
intended
to
be
made
up
of
at
least
of
one
judge
plus
two
additional
judges,
at
least
one
of
whom
was
going
to
be
either
a
supreme
court
judge
or
a
circuit
court
judge.
now,
quite
obviously
once
the
decision
is
issued
from
a
three-judge
court,
at
least
one
of
whom
but
possibly
two
of
whom
are
supreme
court
judges
it
would
be
rather
in
congress.
at
that
point
to
go
to
a
ninth
--
or
a
circuit
court
to
have
that
decision
reviewed.
now,
true
today
the
act
has
been
modified
so
that
it
does
not
anymore
say
at
least
one
of
whom
can
be
either
a
supreme
court
or
a
circuit
court
but
it
does
still
say
at
least
one
of
whom
and
again
at
least
one
of
whom
shall
be
a
circuit
court
judge.
arguably
therefore
one
could
have
a
three-judge
court
with
two
circuit
court
judges.
i
suppose
one
could
go
and
go
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
demand
a
hearing
and
then
but
i
would
question
the
wisdom
of
trying
to
overrule
a
two-judge
court
decision
with
two
judges
from
the
ninth
circuit
sitting
on
it
and
deciding
the
case,
it
would
make
it
somewhat
in
congress.
that's
one
of
the
points.
the
other
point
is
that
interestingly
enough
the
act
does
not
say
prohibit.
it
defines
injunction
within
the
act.
it
says
an
injunction
to
restrain
the
enforcement
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
it
would
restrain
as
this
court
has
recognized
does
not
mean
to
just
prohibit.
it
means
anything
less
than
an
actual
prohibition.
it
means
anything
which
makes
it
difficult,
which
inhibits.
i
think
this
is
true
of
the
first
amendment
cases
and
of
all
cases.
it's
certainly
true
that
a
bill
quia
timet
for
indeed
that
is
what
declaratory
judgment
is
a
restraint
especially
in
view
of
some
of
the
new
decisions
which
have
stated
that
recently
i
believe
it
was
the
second
circuit
or
the
third
circuit
stated
that
a
--
after
the
declaratory
judgment,
a
proceeding
against
the
person
involved
contrary
to
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
was
automatically
an
action
which
was
in
bad
faith.
now,
had
i
read
that
opinion,
i
would
have
been
a
lot
more
cautious
if
before
ever
bringing
a
state
proceeding
after
the
declaration
of
the
three-judge
court.
so
long
as
that
opinion
exists,
i
am
restrained
in
the
future
from
ever
doing
it
again,
even
though
in
good
faith
i
believe
i
am
right.
i
still
couldn't.
so
it
is
a
real
restraint.
finally,
if
we
speak
about
a
case
in
which
the
three-judge
court
is
properly
convened
and
if
--
excuse
me,
and
if
we
have
a
valid
request
for
injunction
and
if
the
request
for
injunction
is
denied
but
the
declaratory
relief
is
granted.
what
are
the
results?
the
practical
result
is
that
the
state
who
is
the
one
that
was
sought
to
be
protected,
whose
procedures
was
not
to
be
speeded
all
the
way
to
this
court
will
be
the
one
defendant
that
will
not
be
able
to
reach
this
court
directly.
whereas,
if
the
relief
had
been
denied,
all
of
it
and
the
act
had
been
found
constitutional,
the
defendant,
the
individual,
would
be
able
to
come
directly
to
this
court.
and
i
think
this
inconsistency
is
--
was
not
intended.
i
think
that
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
say
that
beyond
1201
we
take
1202
and
destroy
it.
it
is
there.
a
court
who
has
the
power
to
issue
declaration
also
has
the
power
to
enforce
that
declaration
under
1201
and
probably
within
the
purview
of
2283
as
well.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
then
in
that
case
we
have
a
bypassing
of
the
totality
of
the
procedures.
now,
a
point
that
is
also
somewhat
important
is
the
fact
that
there
is
another
strength,
there
is
a
possibly
res
judicata
restraint.
now,
that
too
is
a
restraint
because
if
the
state
court
feels
that
--
if
the
people
feel
that
the
declaratory
judgment
is
going
to
be
res
judicata
in
the
state
court
really
there
isn't
much
point
in
bringing
the
proceeding.
so
therefore,
i
would
submit
that
if
we
are
going
to
allow
a
declaratory
judgment
to
be
given
in
these
cases
and
i
think
we
have
to,
i
don't
think
that's
open
for
question
then
i
think
that
the
court
must
preserve
the
rights
to
appeal
by
declaring
that
the
declaratory
judgment
is
per
se
in
these
type
of
cases
injunctive
and
that
it
restraints.
the
second
point
of
course
is
that
both
of
these
as
far
as
the
first
order,
the
order
to
return
it's
obvious
under
the
ledesma
rationale
that
it
is
injunctive
but
the
second
order
is
probably
even
more
injunctive
to
my
mind.
it
opens
me
to
a
contempt
to
which
i
almost
find
inescapable.
i
cannot
in
good
faith,
that's
the
impossibility
in
good
faith
do
that
which
i
do
not
believe
in,
how
do
i
in
good
faith
petition
my
court
whom
i
have
asked
to
do
something
and
who
has
issued
a
valid
order
and
has
rendered
a
valid
judgment.
now
i
have
to
go
back
and
say
“i
don't
believe
i'm
wrong
but
they
tell
me
i
have
to
do
it
in
good
faith
so
your
honors,
i
will
do
it!”
ms.
oretta
d.
sears
that's
correct.
this
type
of
a
situation
puts
an
immediate
burden
upon
the
individual
and
upon
the
office
of
the
district
attorney.
in
california,
the
district
attorney
is
an
elected
official.
in
california,
the
district
attorney
shall
file
all
complaints.
if
a
complaint,
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
under
our
constitution
have
the
right
to
have
the
discretion
of
the
district
attorney
exercised
and
my
government
says,
“i
shall
attend
the
court,
the
superior
court,
the
trial
court
on
the
help
of
the
people.”
how
can
i
go
into
one
of
those
courts
representing
a
party
not
the
people
and
in
this
case
if
i
go
in
petition
i
would
be
representing
a
party
not
the
people.”
ms.
oretta
d.
sears
that's
correct.
ms.
oretta
d.
sears
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
ms.
oretta
d.
sears
that's
correct,
and
that
only
with
his
--
in
his
name.
they
are
alter
egos
totally.
those
are
the
considerations
that
i
felt
were
probably
most
important.
i
do
realize
that
there
had
been
problems,
procedural
problems,
rule
problems.
a
petition
was
filed
under
rule
60
noticed
however
for
july
1,
unless
i
have
read
as
much
as
time
and
physical
limitation
allowed
as
many
of
the
opinions
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
rule
part
of
the
problem
did
not
seem
to
be
so
achieved
perhaps
i
am
wrong
but
i
felt
that
since
the
case
is
here
totally
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
downstairs
at
any
event,
i
did
not
feel
that
that
i
need
to
go
too
much
into
that
point.
and
if
the
court
feels
that
i
should
quite
then
i
will
address
it
more
specifically.
now,
the
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
state
court
magistrate
issued
for
search
warrants
for
i
as
the
head
of
the
written
appeals
section
automatically
direct
my
deputies.
they
will
issue
it
over
the
weekend
however,
or
a
thursday
or
friday
any
weekend
interferes
on
monday.
i
felt
very
strongly
that
the
mandate
of
this
court
require
an
immediate
hearing
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
felt
very
strongly
that
under
rule
41
analogy,
rule
41
and
1538.5,
i
should
premise
are
almost
identical,
if
not
identical
in
scope
and
language
and
i
know
many
cases
the
second
circuit
cases
and
other
cases
that
have
held
that
rule
41
does
allow
the
court
to
have
that
kind
of
a
hearing
at
the
instance
of
the
district
attorney.
and
so
i
asked
for
that
kind
of
a
hearing.
the
defendants
in
the
state
action
or
in
--
at
that
hearing
arrived
and
said
“begging
your
pardon
court
you
have
no
jurisdiction,
goodbye!”
well,
at
that
point
we
proceeded
with
the
hearing.
right
or
wrong,
i
feel
very
strongly
that
that
kind
of
issue
belonged
in
the
state
court.
and
that
the
court
in
granting
relief
actually
showed
itself
totally
opposed
to
allowing
the
courts
to
do
their
job,
the
state
courts.
in
addition,
if
we
are
ever
going
to
have
the
resolution
of
this
issue,
i
tried
it
again
and
again.
they
come
in
and
said
“begging
your
pardon,
but
we
don't
feel
bound
by
this
court.”
i
think
the
hearing
of
august
12
which
has
been
brought
up
as
part
of
the
record
by
the
appellees
is
graphic
of
what
has
been
happening.
the
federal
court
in
that
case
although
it
did
not
pursue
the
issue
further
asked
the
defense
or
the
plaintiff's
counsel,
“why
didn't
you
appeal?
did
you
--
don't
you
think
the
courts
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
would
have
gone
your
way?”
he
says,
“yes!”
he
thought
that
he
would
have
won.
he
thought
that
this
procedure
was
something
that
was
wrong
and
that
the
state
courts
would
have
gone
his
way
and
he
was
asked,
“well,
why
didn't
you
do
it?”
and
he
said,
“because
i
have
a
choice
and
i
choose
to
go
to
the
federal
court;
i
just
didn't
want
to
proceed
in
this
court.”
and
that
is
part
of
the
problem.
i
would
submit
that
this
type
of
action
does
frustrate
the
relationships
between
the
courts
especially
when
then
you
have
a
proceedings
that
in
the
municipal
court
at
the
same
time.
now,
there
are
many
factual
points
that
counsel
has
made.
i
don't
think
they're
relevant.
first
of
all,
there
are
points
of
california
law
and
they
are
points
that
should
have
been
made
in
the
state
court
but
were
not
made.
i
don't
know
under
what
provision
he
has
a
choice
to
argue
the
validity
of
a
search
warrant
either
prospective
or
already
issued
before
a
federal
court
rather
than
before
a
state
court.
i
have
found
no
case
that
indicates
that
this
is
the
law.
perhaps
i
have
overlooked
something.
since
i
would
like
to
retain
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
and
i
would
like
to
defer
to
the
attorney
general
list
to
the
questions,
i
would
--
ms.
oretta
d.
sears
that's
correct.
there
are
two
occasions
and
this
is
the
procedure
under
california
law
which
is
designed
to
protect
the
defendant
and
particularly
protect
the
possibility
of
a
first
amendment
right.
he
cannot
--
in
california
an
officer
may
not
seize
a
film
as
obscene
on
an
arrest.
it
must
be
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant.
secondly,
the
magistrate
cannot
issue
that
warrant
without
either
one,
personally
viewing
the
film
or
other
material
or
two,
without
an
affidavit
that
is
specific
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
that
material.
on
saturday,
a
fourth
warrant
was
issued
and
in
each
instance
the
warrant
were
sited
that
there
were
differences
in
these
films.
ms.
oretta
d.
sears
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
i
just
wish
to
answer
by
referring
the
court
to
certain
passages
of
the
appendix
that
i
think
the
court
has
been
wondering
about.
the
appendix
at
page
82
shows
the
reason
why
we
were
not
able
to
object
to
the
three-judge
court
composition.
we
were
notified
on
february
8
of
the
existence
of
the
three-judge
court
and
the
three-judge
court
order
designating
it
where
it
was
just
found
on
pages
84
and
85
is
dated
january
8
and
gave
us
two
weeks
from
the
january
8th
date
to
complain
about
the
three-judge
court.
i
found
that
was
few
time
to
attempt
to
do
anything
about
that.
number
two,
the
appendix
at
page
89
shows
that
just
this
matter
of
course
we
did
not
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
because
we
were
ordered
to
submit
an
affidavit
and
points
in
authorities
and
without
oral
argument.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
never
