mr.
arlo
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
complex
case.
in
fact,
there
would
be
a
public
plot
for
a
gilbert
and
sullivan
parody
on
the
administration
of
justice
and
by
that
i
mean
no
disrespect
for
either
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court
because
it
presents
the
very
fundamental
problem
of
the
jurisdiction
in
authority
of
federal
courts
to
interfere
with
the
administration
of
state
justice.
mrs.
sears
has
briefly
outlined
the
facts
and
i
hope
to
outline
them
a
little
more
fully.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
two
problems.
first,
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
the
cases
of
younger
versus
harris
to
this
matter,
since
that
the
three-judge
court
felt
that
this
was
not
that
type
of
case.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
harassment
which
the
court
found
without
a
hearing.
let's
start
as
mrs.
sears
did,
on
friday,
november
23rd,
a
magistrate
california
in
this
four-court
judge
issued
three
warrants.
in
each
instance
on
sufficient
affidavits
and
twice
on
the
viewing
of
the
films
involved
here
as
to
their
obscenity,
a
practice
under
california
law
which
indeed
was
brought
about
by
a
case
flack
versus
municipal
court
which
counsel
for
the
plaintiff's
here
instituted.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
himself.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
of
the
same
titles
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
different
content.
on
monday
the
26th
the
district
attorney
instituted
a
proceeding
which
has
been
characterized
variously
as
injunctive
restraining
whatever
but
a
proceeding
quasi-criminal
in
nature
designed
to
lead
to
an
order
of
seizure
of
these
films.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
it
is
not.
no
it
is
not
but
our
--
the
california
law
on
that
i
think
is
unclear
that's
quite
correct.
but
the
point
is
that
under
the
procedure
has
alleged
in
this
complaint,
the
defendants
here
miranda
walnut
properties,
pussycat
theatres,
have
an
opportunity
to
come
into
the
superior
court
of
california
and
raise
every
objection
that
they
made
in
the
federal
district
court,
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute,
the
validity
of
the
procedures
in
that
court,
the
validity
of
the
seizure,
the
validity
of
the
--
the
question
of
the
identity
of
the
films,
indeed
they
could
raise
the
obscenity
question.
they
refused
to
take
part
in
that
proceeding.
they
appeared
and
contested
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
walked
out.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
would
have
been.
it
read,
no.
indeed
it
will
result
in
the
seizure
of
those
films
and
held
that
the
pussycat
theatre.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
either
way.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
the
question
presented
here,
there
was
an
adversary
hearing
offered
under
this
proceeding
prior
to
the
restraining
order
issued.
there
are
questions
of
california
law.
i
can
see
that
that
is
precisely
why
the
federal
court
should
have
abstained
precisely
why.
all
of
these
questions
could
have
been
raised
in
the
appellate
courts
of
california
and
including
the
supreme
court
of
california.
finally
of
course,
one
of
the
--
and
they
make
the
complaint
that
it
is
completely
unfounded,
they
refer
to
some
abatement
cases
and
it's
correct
that
our
courts
have
held
that
the
red
light
abatement
action
is
not
applicable
to
films,
only
live
conduct.
but
of
course,
they
don't
point
out
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
before
it
now
a
case
involving
the
nuisance
type
injunctive
proceedings
under
370
of
our
penal
code,
basic
nuisance
action.
the
los
angeles
court
of
appeals
in
los
angeles
for
the
second
appellant
district
held
the
procedures
utilized
by
the
los
angeles
district
attorney
to
be
proper
under
california
law.
two
weeks
ago
our
court,
supreme
court
granted
a
hearing
in
that
case,
some
of
the
very
issues
that
they
raised
here.
finally,
two
days
after
this
hearing
of
which
counsel
walked
out,
they
filed
a
complaint
in
the
federal
court.
the
allegations
are
that
this
proceeding
that
we
have
just
discussed
violated
their
rights.
secondly,
they
complained
that
the
seizures
pursuant
to
the
warrants
violated
their
rights.
it
was
assigned
to
and
immediately
prior
to
that,
of
course
complaints
were
filed
against
the
theatre
manager
of
pussycat
theatre,
the
managers
who
were
exhibiting
the
film.
a
hearing
was
held
before
judge
lydick
federal
district
judge
on
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
he
determined
that
there
was
no
bad
faith,
no
harassment
that
the
officers
had
acted
pursuant
to
the
valid
state
warrants.
however
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh
yes,
i'm
glad
you
raised
that.
the
case
was
originally
assigned
to
judge
ferguson.
and
the
record
reveals
that
he
recused
himself
on
the
ground
that
of
possible
bias.
it
was
then
assigned
to
judge
lydick
who
heard
the
temporary,
the
request
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
now,
on
december
28,
1973
issued
an
order
denying
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
finding
no
bad
faith,
finding
no
harassment,
finding
no
irreparable
injury.
he
did,
however,
and
i
--
we
suggest
on
our
brief
that
he
erred,
because
he
found
that
the
question
was
not
wholly
without
merit.
some
substance
and
some
perhaps
federal
questions
but
he
also
determined
that
the
question
of
abstention
he
felt
was
a
question
for
the
three-judge
district
court.
we
feel
that
at
that
point,
he
should
simply
deny
the
action
dismissed
and
the
appeal
here
would
have
been
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
and
of
course
if
he
were
wrong
it
would
have
been
back
to
the
three-judge
district
court.
but
the
--
thereafter,
he
then
issued
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
certified
it
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
on
that
date,
same
day.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes
he
did.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
correct.
we
suggest
to
hear
in
spite
of
the
correctness
of
this
decision
overall
procedural
error.
however,
the
order
appointing
the
three-judge
district
court
did
not
include
judge
lydick,
the
district
judge
to
whom
it
was
assigned.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
and
who
certified,
rather
it
was
assigned
to
judge
ferguson
another
u.s.
district
court
judge
and
a
circuit
court
judge
and
a
third
judge.
we
raised
the
question
that
that
is
jurisdictional
under
the
statute
and
i
refer
not
to
devote
additional
time
to
that
question.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
why
not,
because
i
feel
that
there
are
maybe
misjudged
but
i
feel
there
are
more
critical
issues
in
the
case
than
that.
then
that
when
we
feel
that
we
have
a
right
to
have
the
--
we
feel
that
it's
important
and
we've
raised
it
but
we
feel
that
that
we
have
the
right
to
have
the
district
judge
who
heard
this
matter
sit,
indeed
if
it's
referred
back
obviously
who
to
whom
do
you
refer,
is
a
very
good
point,
justice
marshall.
we
certainly
aren't
conceding
the
point.
the
statute
is
very
explicit.
it
says
it
shall
include
the
district
judge
who
certified
the
matter
before
whom
the
case
was
brought.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yeah.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
can't
say
that
we
did.
no,
i
don't
believe
the
record
reveals
that
we
did.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
think
it
came
about
if
you
look
at
proceedings
on
december
5th,
1973,
six
days
after
this
action
was
filed,
you'll
notice
that
the
same
panel
was
assigned
to
consolidate
--
a
number
of
consolidated
cases
and
in
those
cases
they
discussed
abstention
california
statute.
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
seven
or
eight
involving
other
counties
in
california
and
other
defendants
and
other
plaintiffs.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
also
obscenity
cases
and
apparently
they
were
assigned
apparently
by
the
ninth
circuit
to
handle
these
issues.
that's
the
only
explanation
i
have
but
i
--
it's
a
mystery
to
me
other
than
that.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes
and
we
urge
it
we've
urged
it
into
the
briefs.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
think
it
speaks
for
itself.
i
think
it's
--
he
says
he
was
biased
when
he
recused
himself.
he
then
sits
on
the
very
same
matter.
i
don't
wish
to
infer
beyond
that.i
think
it's
improper.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
that
is
not
so
here.
it's
that
the
--
if
you'll
notice
the
order
of
the
recusal,
it
refer
specifically
with
the
fact
that
he
has
knowledge
of
it
and
acquainted
with
and
otherwise
biased
in
reference
to
parties
in
this
action.
they
happen
to
be
officers
of
the
city
of
buena
park
who
some
of
the
defendants
here.
and
that
you
may
draw
any
inference
that
the
bias
was
perhaps
in
their
favor.
but
i
suggest
that
that
may
not
be
the
correct
inference
to
be
drawn
on
the
record
to
this
case
and
on
the
record
of
the
incident
to
which
this
recusal
referred.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
possible,
apparently
he
did.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
if
the
district
court
judge
lydick
is
on
that
three-judge
district
court
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
three-judge
court
simply
resided
the
facts
of
reference
to
the
warrant
and
said
they
speak
for
themselves.
judge
lydick
of
course
had
found
that
this
was
good
faith,
execution
of
a
lawful
warrant
by
a
judge,
a
magistrate
in
the
california
court.
i
think
that
that
question
of
harassment
does
deserve
extended
discussion
here.
to
begin
with
of
course,
the
burden
is
upon
the
plaintiff
here
to
establish
it.
it
must
be
beyond
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
because
the
presumption
under
federal
and
all
of
the
cases
is
presumption
of
validity
and
proper
action
by
the
state
officers.
there
are
a
recitation
of
these
facts
that
i
just
recited
in
reference
to
the
search
warrant
is
the
only
basis
apparently
for
the
three-judge
court's
determination
of
bad
faith.
it's
simply
the
enforcement
in
our
view
of
good
faith
the
performance
of
the
duty
by
the
officers,
a
duty
compelled
by
the
statutes
in
california
by
the
valid
warrant
in
california,
the
valid
enforcement
of
our
state
laws.
but
really
there
are
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well
no,
except
into
the
extent
that
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
tro
by
judge
lydick
prior
to
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court.
he
held
a
hearing
and
he
found
good
faith.
it
was
submitted
to
the
three-judge
court
on
the
affidavits
before
judge
lydick.
that
question
is
expressly
submitted.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
precisely
what
i'm
saying,
yes
and
correct.
that's
precisely
what
happened.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
had
no,
indeed
the
very
same
affidavits
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
same,
in
fact
the
counsel
were
present
before
judge
lydick
and
argued
the
matter,
the
same
affidavits
were
presented.
no,
they
held
no
hearing
of
any
kind
or
character.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
they
did
not,
they
did
offer
counsel
the
opportunity
to
present
additional
affidavits
and
additional
materials
but
no
additional
material
was
in
fact
presented.
now,
but
involved
in
this
question
of
harassment,
here's
a
question
which
another
question
of
state
law
and
procedure
which
was
presented
to
the
state
court
because
you
know
it
mean
while
back
in
the
state
court
we,
the
proceeding
is
going
on.
a
complaint
was
filed
against
the
employees
of
pussycat
theatre
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
criminal
complaint.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
criminal
complaint
against
the
employees
was
filed
prior
to
the
federal
action.
the
criminal
action
in
reference
to
the
plaintiffs
here
was
filed,
it
was
signed
three
days
before
that
was
in
january.
to
be
specific
january
9th
and
january
14th
that
was
filed
which
was
three
days
before
service
of
the
summons
on
the
district
attorney.
it
was
filed
the
day
after
and
signed
two
days
before.
but
the
proceedings
were
held
in
the
meanwhile
under
our
statutes,
the
1538.5
or
rule
41
procedure
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
return
the
property
was
in
fact
heard
by
the
municipal
court
in
orange
county.
that
court
ruled
in
their
favor
as
to
two
counts.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we're
dealing
here
with
each
film
is
a
subject
of
a
separate
count.
we're
not
talking
about
four
films
in
one
count.
we're
talking
about
four
films
which
are
alleged
to
be
and
are
in
fact
different.
the
municipal
court
judge
ruled
in
their
favor.
he
ruled
that
it
violated
heller
versus
united
states,
that
in
fact
two
of
these
films
were
sufficiently
identical
that
they
should
be
suppressed.
and
in
fact
an
affidavit
was
filed
before
the
three-judge
district
court
by
counsel
for
plaintiffs
to
that
effect.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
absolutely!
at
that
point
they
have
been
named
as
parties
and
that
they
had
been
named
as
defendants
in
the
criminal
action.
the
--
that
matter
was
certified
and
this
is
in
the
record
was
certified
appeal
was
taken
by
the
people
on
those
two
counts.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
they
were
different.
they
were
of
same
title
but
they
were
obviously
not
identical
prints,
it
was
“deep
throat.”
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
apparently
what
happened
was
as
pointed
out
here
on
page
48
that
what
they
did
was
--
is
in
another
instance
came
on
with
what
they
call
a
“soft
virgin”
first.
and
then
the
warrant
was
issued.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
these
records
here
make
it
clear
that
the
procedure
at
orange
county
is
that
after
one
seizure
on
the
same
film
that
the
procedure
is
to
be
the
issuance
of
a
citation
for
every
subsequent
violation
and
not
an
additional
search
warrant
in
seizure.
however,
the
officers
here
as
indicated
by
--
at
page
48
it
went
back
the
second
time.
it
was
a
harder
version
if
you
please.
it
contained
additional
acts
of
sexual
intercourse
etcetera.
they
were
not
contained
in
the
first
film.
it
was
to
where
the
harder
version
of
the
same
film
or
the
same
type
if
you
please
and
the
same
thing
happened
on
the
third
and
the
fourth
instance.
and
that
issue
was
before
the
municipal
court
in
california
and
they
prevail
on
that
question.
however,
the
people
appealed
and
they
want
to
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
in
orange
county.
and
the
appellate
department
ruled
to
the
contrary.
they
reversed
the
municipal
court,
holding
that
on
the
affidavits
and
the
material
presented
and
that
the
motion
to
suppress
that
in
fact
their
contention
was
not
well
taken.
the
appellees
here,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
federal
action
pursue
their
remedy
in
the
state
courts.
they
could
certify
the
question
to
the
appellate
court
for
san
diego.
no,
they
did
not.
they
come
back
to
the
three-judge
district
court
with
the
same
contention
that
all
of
these
violate
state
law.
so
we
have
a
ruling
in
the
state
court
which
they
did
not
appeal.
we
have
two
rulings
that
they
did
not
appeal
or
seek
to
review;
one,
this
restraining
order
if
you
please
or
order
of
seizure.
they
refuse
to
participate,
they
refuse
to
appeal.
secondly,
they
decline
to
further
appeal
the
determination
concerning
the
identity
of
these
films.
and
they've
consistently
refused
to
present
to
the
state
courts
the
question
of
obscenity
and
it's
set
out
here
in
the
record
very
plainly.
they
say
we
are
not
presenting
and
do
not
intend
to
present
the
question
of
obscenity
to
the
state
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
read
in
connection
with
that
i
think
the
basic
issue
here
one
portion
of
the
proceeding
on
august
12
is
in
the
appendix
here
before
judge
ferguson
sitting
presumably
as
a
member
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
the
question
presented,
have
you
taken
that
order
up
to
the
california
court
of
appeals
referring
to
the
order
here
of
seizure
of
the
additional
copies
as
quasi
criminal
actions?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
state
court
of
appeals.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
san
diego.
he
says,
the
answer
by
mr.
brown,
“no,
we
have
not.”
why
not?
“because,
your
honor,
initially
back
in
november
when
this
first
occurred
the
day
after
the
hearing,
we
filed
a
complaint
in
this
action,
this
federal
action.”
and
one
of
the
basis
for
relief
alleged
in
the
complaint
was
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
rights.
he
goes
on
to
say
that
once
we
had
invoke
the
jurisdiction
that
this
court
properly
we
sought
relief
in
this
court,
we
did
not
pressed
the
matter
further
in
this
california
state
courts.
another
point
he
says,
the
judge
asked
them
when
you
go
halfway
shouldn't
you
be
required
to
go
all
the
way,
referring
to
the
same
proceedings.
mr.
brown
said,
it
was
our
--
this
is
at
age
15,
"it
was
our
purpose
in
the
beginning,
not
to
litigate
these
claims
in
the
state
court.”
i
submit
your
honor
that
that's
precisely
the
problem
created
in
this
type
of
litigation
where
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
it's
in
the
appendix.
in
fact,
we're
very
happy
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court
by
the
other
side.
it
was
--
it's
not
printed
yet.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i'm
reading
from
the
transcript
to
the
proceedings
of
august
12,
1974
before
judge
lydick.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes
it
is.
it's
in
the
--
it's
not
in
the
appendix,
i'm
sorry.
it
was
after
we
requested
it.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes
it
is
filed.
there's
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
court,
but
it's
not
the
printed
appendix
as
what
i
wish
to
say,
because
the
appellees
here
requested
that
this
be
made
part
of
the
record
and
was
not
part
of
the
original
printed
record.
it's
filed,
yes
indeed.
i
regret
that
i
didn't.
thank
you
your
honor.
