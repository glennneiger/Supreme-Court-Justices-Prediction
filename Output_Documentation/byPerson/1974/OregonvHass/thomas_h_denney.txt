mr.
thomas
h.
denney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
state
of
oregon’s
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
holding
that
statements
made
by
a
criminal
defendant
who
has
been
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
miranda
versus
arizona
and
who
has
expressed
the
desire
to
talk
to
an
attorney
or
has
at
least
inquired
about
the
inavailability
of
counsel
may
not
be
used
to
impeach
his
trial
testimony.
from
the
states
point
of
view,
the
holding
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
this
case
denies
to
oregon
prosecutors
--
the
right
to
use
statements,
evidence
which
is
constitutionally
admissible
under
this
court's
holding
in
harris
versus
new
york
and
we
therefore
seek
reversal
of
the
oregon
supreme
court's
decision.
perhaps
from
my
broader
point
of
view
this
case
presents
the
court
with
an
opportunity
to
delineate
more
fully
the
extent
of
the
holding
in
harris
and
i
should
hope
if
the
court
chooses
to
do
so
that
some
of
the
tangential
material
that
it
is
put
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
in
footnotes
maybe
of
some
assistance.
before
i
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
there
are
two
objections
to
the
states
being
here
at
all
that
are
raised
in
the
brief
for
respondent
that
i
would
like
to
deal
with
very
briefly.
first
of
this
is
the
contention
that
the
state
of
oregon
has
no
standing
to
be
here
because
we
are
not
aggrieved
by
the
judgment
of
the
oregon
supreme
court.
well,
i
think
it’s
fairly
clear
that
a
holding
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
that
the
state
of
oregon
may
not
use
evidence
that
is
constitutionally
permissible.
thus,
make
us
a
party
aggrieved
and
i
don't
think
that
the
right
of
the
state
to
seek
certiorari
in
such
cases
is
open
to
very
serious
question.
the
most
recent
case
in
which
the
--
that
i
could
find
and
which
the
state
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
in
a
similar
case
was
california
versus
green
in
1970
but
i'm
sure
there
have
been
many
petitions
sought
in
the
--
sought
since
and
certainly
perhaps
if
you
grant
it
and
certainly
i
don’t
think
this
is
an
issue.
of
a
little
more
substance
perhaps
is
the
argument
raised
in
question.
one
in
the
respondent's
brief
to
the
effect
that
the
state
cannot
prevail
in
this
case
because
the
states
are
free
to
impose
higher
or
different
standards
of
constitutional
guarantees
of
liberty
let
me
say.
then,
those
enunciated
in
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
well,
we
don’t
quite
agree
with
the
argument
that
is
advanced
as
we
understand
the
law
of
course,
this
court
is
the
final
interpreter
of
any
question
arising
under
the
federal
constitution
and
the
states
are
not
free
to
predicate
any
holding
contrary
on
grounds
of
the
federal
constitution.
we
think
as
i've
indicated
in
the
brief
for
petitioner
among
other
places
i
think
cooper
versus
california
clearly
implies
what
i
have
just
said.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
believe
that
was
what
was
done
in
that
case
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
not
positive,
i
think
ker
versus
california
was
another
such
case
and
this
is
one
that
is
cited
in
the
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
oh!
certainly
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
my
point
incidentally
this
is
not
the
search
and
seizure.
this
is
a
confession
question
of
course.
but
our
point
is
that
this
case
is
just
clearly
not
beside
it
on
state
constitutional
grounds
and
i
think
i've
indicated
that
in
the
reply
brief
to
expand
a
little
more
fully
on
it.
the
state
constitution
was
not
invoked
in
connection
with
this
assignment
of
error
by
either
side
below.
the
state
constitution
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
oregon
supreme
court.
the
court's
opinion
instead
distinguishes
this
case
from
harris.
in
addition,
the
case
is
on
which
the
oregon
supreme
court
relied
the
oregon
cases
of
state
versus
brewton
and
state
versus
neely
are
themselves
not
predicated
on
the
oregon
constitution.
the
constitution
isn’t
--
the
state
constitution
isn’t
even
mentioned
in
state
versus
brewton.
it
is
mentioned
in
state
versus
neely
but
only
to
say
that
we
are
not
predicating
our
holding
on
the
oregon
state
constitution.
now,
it
was
i
cannot
say
that
the
state
constitution
did
not
come
up
at
all
in
this
case
because
during
the
oral
argument
in
this
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
the
chief
justice
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
asked
if
the
state
were
not
--
if
the
supreme
court
were
not
free
to
predicate
its
holding
on
the
oregon
constitution
and
reached
a
different
result
from
whatever
this
court
might
reach.
we
agreed
that
they
have
that
power
but
the
discussion
ended
there.
so,
we
submit
that
this
case
just
simply
is
not
a
case
predicated
on
state
constitutional
grounds
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
of
this
case
which
would
support
what
might
otherwise
argue
for
a
remand
of
this
case
for
clarification.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes.
i
believe
its
set
forth
in
the
respondent's
brief
as
article
1,
section
12
--
no
person
shall
be
put
in
jeopardy
twice
for
the
same
offense
nor
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
prosecution
to
testify
against
himself.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
absolutely
not
but
my
point
is
they
didn't
and
that
is
why
we
contend
we
have
every
right
to
be
here.
now,
turning
to
the
facts
of
this
case;
the
facts
are
simple
relatively
undisputed
and
it
would
be
a
trivial
case
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
harris
issue
is
clearly
presented
here.
basically,
it
involves
the
theft
of
a
bicycle
out
of
the
garage
of
a
resident
in
klamath
falls,
oregon.
the
owner
of
the
bicycle
and
his
father
saw
the
thief
who
was
we
think
it
clear
now
defendant's
accomplice
drive
the
bicycle
or
ride
the
bicycle
out
of
the
driveway.
they
gave
a
chase.
they
ultimately
intercepted
the
defendant’s
volkswagen
bus.
the
defendant
was
driving
at
the
bicycle
was
in
the
back.
the
father
and
son
recovered
the
bicycle
and
called
the
police.
in
response
to
that
call,
a
state
police
officer
traced
the
volkswagen
bus
and
went
to
the
defendant’s
home.
he
advised
him
of
his
miranda
rights
and
his
advice
incidentally
included
a
specific
warning
that
the
defendant
could
stop
talking
at
any
time.
in
addition
to
the
usual
fourfold
right
to
remain
silent
etcetera
has
admitted
that
he
had
taken
two
bicycles
that
day
and
he
wasn’t
sure
which
one
the
officer
was
talking
about.
upon
further
conversation,
he
said
that
he
had
given
one
bicycle
back
which
i
gather
his
interpretation
of
the
incident
with
the
father
and
son
demanding
it
back
and
that
he
had
concealed
the
other
and
he
agreed
to
show
the
officer
where
he
had
concealed
the
second
bicycle.
on
the
way
to
the
spot
where
the
second
bicycle
was
concealed
however
has
with
already
admitted
his
guilt
in
the
offense
to
this
extent
indicated
and
the
exact
wording
he
used
is
a
little
bit
in
dispute
the
two
versions
are
set
forth
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
indicated
that
he
would
like
to
consult
with
an
attorney.
the
officer
said
that
he
couldn't
make
counsel
available
to
him
right
then.
however,
he
would
make
counsel
available
or
at
least
a
phone
would
be
provided
to
him
as
soon
as
they
got
to
the
state
police
headquarters.
according
to
the
officer
in
response
to
a
specific
question
from
hass
he
then
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
force
hass
to
continue
with
the
investigation
but
he
would
like
to
clear
the
matter
off.
now,
hass'
version
of
the
events
as
that
the
officer
said,
“i
can't
let
you
see
a
lawyer
but
i'll
let
you
when
we
get
down
to
the
station.
and
even
hass'
version
of
the
events
does
not
claim
that
there
was
any
greater
degree
of
coercion
or
pressure
put
upon
him
than
that.
in
any
event,
they
went
to
the
spot
where
the
second
bicycle
was
recovered
and
it
turned
out
to
have
been
taken
from
another
residence
in
the
same
general
area
at
approximately
the
same
time.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
indicating
specifically
that
the
bicycle
had
been
taken
the
same
day
except
for
the
defendant's
later
testimony
to
that
effect.
there
was
an
in
camera
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
ought
the
police
officer's
testimony
would
be
admissible
with
respect
to
everything
that
the
defendant
has
it
said
and
done
at
the
time
of
this
interrogation
or
this
questioning.
after
hearing,
the
testimony
the
trial
court
ruled
that
everything
has
did
and
said
and
in
fact
defense
counsel
conceded
this
that
everything
has
did
and
said
up
to
the
time
he
inquired
about
the
availability
of
counsel
would
be
clearly
admissible.
but
that
this
inquiry
brought
miranda
into
play
and
that
nothing
else
would
be
admissible
in
the
states
case
in
chief
and
nothing
else
was
admitted
in
states
case
in
chief.
has
then
took
to
stand
and
testified
that
he
and
two
other
fellows
have
been
driving
around
the
general
area
where
the
bicycles
were
taken
that
the
other
two
person
had
taken
the
bicycles
without
his
prior
knowledge
and
that
he
didn't
know
exactly
where
they
came
from.
this
was
all
they
did
on
the
direct
examination.
in
short,
he
admits
his
part
in
the
theft
of
the
bicycles
in
the
sense
of
receiving
and
concealing
the
stolen
property.
he
conceded
that
he
figured
they
were
stolen
from
the
way
his
two
friends
brought
them
to
him
but
he
claimed
that
he
had
no
prior
knowledge
of
the
crime.
and
that
he
therefore
wasn’t
guilty
of
the
burglary
with
which
he
was
charged.
and
this
is
particularly
significant
in
oregon
or
it
was
particularly
significant
still
is
actually
because
oregon
some
months
before
the
trial
in
this
case
have
adopted
a
same
transaction
test
of
determining
when
jeopardy
attaches
and
it
is
very
probable
under
the
teachings
of
that
particular
case
which
was
state
versus
brown
and
again
cited
in
the
brief
that
had
the
jury
believe
passes
testimony
and
acquitted
him
of
the
burglary
charge
double
jeopardy
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
construing
the
oregon
constitution
would
have
barred
a
second
trial
for
the
theft
at
which
he
then
admitted
his
guilt.
well,
in
rebuttal
to
hass'
testimony
after
the
case
of
harris
versus
new
york
was
called
of
the
trial
court's
attention.
the
state
recalled
the
state
police
officer
who
testified
that
after
he
had
obtained
the
admissions
from
hass
that
he
had
previously
testified
to,
hass
had
taken
him
around
to
the
residential
area
where
the
bicycles
were
taken
and
that
hass
had
pointed
out
the
precise
locations
of
the
two
houses
from
which
those
bicycles
had
been
taken.
the
court
then
instructed
the
jury
that
this
testimony
was
to
be
received
only
for
impeachment
purposes
and
then
on
surrebuttal
has
went
ahead
to
deny
that
he
had
pointed
out
the
houses
in
question.
there's
very
little
i
can
say
about
this
case
because
basically
when
we
get
to
the
legal
issues
presented
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
comes
so
clearly
within
the
parameters
of
harris
that
it's
almost
pointless
to
draw
the
distinctions
that
oregon
supreme
court
did.
in
the
first
place
here
as
before,
we
have
as
in
harris
we
have
the
defendant
affirmatively
stating
on
the
direct
examination
testimony
that
he
know
--
when
he
knows
that
the
state
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
present
contrary
testimony
at
least
in
this
case
in
chief
and
wasn't
able
to
do
it.
they
knew
that
this
testimony
existed
and
they
knew
that
they
have
been
ruled
and
admissible.
it
seems
that
this
presents
in
this
kind
of
context
i'm
not
necessarily
saying
that
it
happened
here
that
we
have
a
marvelous
opportunity
for
criminal
defendants
to
tailor
their
testimony
in
accordance
to
account
for
anything
they
may
have
said
prior
to
the
time
they
may
have
asked
for
counsel
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
there
is
no
contention
as
i
have
mentioned
before
that
anything
hass'
statements
or
what
he
did
was
in
fact
coerced
or
involuntary
or
that
any
pressure
was
put
on
him.
he
have
been
advised
of
this
miranda
rights,
he
have
been
told
he
could
stop
answering
questions
at
any
time,
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
--
the
lawyer
he
was
told
that
counsel
would
be
made
available
to
him
when
he
got
the
police
station.
and
that's
it
he
doesn't
claim
that
there
was
any
coercion
at
all
put
upon
him
to
continue
beyond
the
mere
request
of
the
officer.
this
we
submit
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
primer
and
the
standards
of
voluntariness
and
trustworthiness
which
would
render
the
statements
he
made
and
the
things
he
did
after
he
inquired
about
the
availability
of
counsel
admissible
at
least
for
impeachment
purposes.
as
i've
noted
in
a
footnote
it
seems
to
be
an
open
question
yet
at
least
this
court
hasn't
directly
spoken
on
the
issue
of
whether
advise
of
rights
which
tells
an
accuse
that
counsel
will
be
made
available
to
him
at
a
later
time
such
as
when
and
if
you
go
to
court
was
one
example
makes
the
statements
inadmissible
in
the
case
in
chief.
we're
not
contesting
this
because
the
argument
wasn't
raised
below
and
i
don't
feel
that
i'm
entitled
to
make
the
contention
here
that
the
statements
has
that
were
admissible
in
the
case
in
chief
nor
do
i
need
to.
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
this
kind
of
statement
should
be
made
and
should
be
admissible
for
impeachment
purposes
under
the
facts
of
this
case
particularly
where
as
again
here
the
jury
was
carefully
instructed
that
the
statements
were
limited
to
impeachment
and
were
not
to
be
considered
in
determining
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
hass
per
se.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
it
is.
it
is
an
attempt
to
predict
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
certainly.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
trial
had,
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
if
i
may
expand
on
that
a
little
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
oregon
supreme
court
prior
to
johnson
versus
new
jersey
at
this
court's
decision
had
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well,
perhaps
they
weren't
aware
of
it
because
the
oregon
courts
had
held
that
it's
our
holding
that
oregon
holding
in
state
versus
nelly
which
was
kind
of
anticipation
of
miranda
decided
post
escobedo
and
pre-miranda
was
retroactive
to
a
greater
degree
than
this
court
subsequently
held
miranda
to
be
retroactive.
and
i
think
this
language
is
getting
at
that
problem
because
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
exact
date
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know
but
johnson
was
in
1966
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
both,
but
the
oregon
rule
was
as
i
recall
it
that
case,
that
nelly
and
subsequently
until
we
had
a
case
somewhat
later
even
miranda
would
apply
retroactively
to
cases
which
were
not
terminated,
concluded
and
that
included
a
90-day
period
after
a
final
judgment
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
within
which
the
defendant
or
the
other
side
could
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
well,
they
distinguish
also
between
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
that
would
be
true
but
my
position
is
that
this
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
i
suppose
that’s
part
of
the
decision
you
will
have
to
undertake.
i
think
when
you
read
the
brewton
opinion
as
no
doubt
you
have
but
when
you
look
at
one
closely
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
as
i
say
i
think
it
turns
into
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
had
done
with
regard
to
its
retroactivity
rules
about
the
application
of
miranda
and
nelly.
i
think
the
opinion
as
a
whole
in
brewton
clearly
is
an
attempt
to
predict
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
will
do
with
the
question
of
impeachment.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
but
again
they
are
again
also
applying
the
nelly
case
in
the
brewton
case
and
the
nelly
case
is
not
predicated.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
don't
recall
it
all
offhand.
the
distinction
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
drew
between
this
case
and
harris
is
one
we
submit
is
not
one
that
calls
for
different
result.
in
either
event
whether
the
police
are
to
be
faulted
for
not
advising
a
man
of
his
constitutional
rights
properly
in
the
first
place,
or
whether
they
continue
to
question
him
to
some
degree
at
least
with
his
tentative
request
for
counsel
as
we
are
confronted
with
here.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
not
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well,
it
very
probably
does
and
but
i
submit
that
thinking
that
he
is
going
beyond
the
requirements
of
this
court's
previous
decisions
does
not
necessarily
indicate
at
all
that
the
case
is
predicated
on
state
grounds
rather
than
federal.
i
return
in
my
basic
position
that
i
think
the
brewton
case
is
more
of
an
attempt
to
predict
what
this
court
would
do
with
the
federal
question
than
an
attempt
to
predicate
something
separately
on
state
grounds.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
he
did
and
i
found
it
rather
strange
i
was
not
very
frequently
before
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
at
the
time
that
the
majority
opinion
doesn't
event
talk
about
walter.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
it
is
unless
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
yes,
two
very
brief
points.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
decided
on
state
or
federal
grounds
i
think
and
i
don’t
want
to
take
a
great
deal
of
time
with
the
basic
proposition.
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whether
this
case
is
predicated
on
state
or
constitutional
ground
or
federal
grounds.
counsel
mentioned
in
his
argument
the
case
of
state
versus
florance
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote
to
point
out
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
does
think
itself
entitled
to
interpret
federal
questions
more
restrictively
than
this
court
does.
this
is
the
sentence
which
mr.
mckeen
just
mentioned
in
his
oral
argument
that
the
end
of
it
we
can
interpret
the
fourth
amendment
more
restrictively
than
interpreted
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
we
certainly
do.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
this
is
footnote
12,
page
9
of
the
petition
your
honor.
i'm
quoting
from
state
versus
florance.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
it
was
just
decided
about
a
month
after
this
case
your
honor.
it’s
527
p.2nd
1202
i
didn’t
have
the
full
citation
at
the
time
i
wrote
that
brief
though
i
do
have
it
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
it
was
a
search
and
seizure.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
court
--
the
oregon
supreme
court
decided
to
follow
this
court’s
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
enunciated
in
u.s.
versus
robinson
your
honor.
so,
it
is
kind
of
dictum
they
were
saying
well,
in
the
full
context
of
the
opinion
the
opinion
run
something
to
the
effect
that
the
robinson
opinion
somewhat
surprises
us
we
have
though
the
law
was
a
little
more
restrictive
if
we
choose
we
can
continue
to
apply
a
more
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
law
either
by
interpreting
the
oregon
constitution
provision
on
search
and
seizure
or
by
interpreting
the
fourth
amendment
more
restrictively.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
certainly,
we
agree
on
the
first.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
no,
and
that
mere
fact
that
the
court
in
this
case
indicates
that
they
think
they're
free
to
do
it.
i
think
shed
some
light
on
what
they
are
doing
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
they
have
a
very
fact
that
they
have
to
distinguish
to
harris
case
is
some
indication
that
they
do
this.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
that
was
my
point,
yes.
in
addition
to
the
other
factors
which
are
mentioned
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
not
expressly.
my
point
is
that
implicitly
they
think
they
do.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
and
that
is
why
i'm
saying
which
was
based
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
on
the
contrary,
because
harris
is
a
ruling
that
is
favorable.
i
suppose
the
argument
can
be
made
either
way
but
the
fact
is
that
the
harris
decision
cuts
against
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
decision
in
this
case.
the
distinction
that
they
have
to
draw
is
to
say
on
its
facts
this
isn’t
harris.
and
therefore
they
are
still
interpreting
the
federal
constitution
is
the
position
i'm
taking.
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
issue
just
briefly,
there
was
one
other
point
that
came
up
in
counsel’s
argument
for
the
respondent.
the
harris
case
does
not
pause
to
consider
whether
the
states
or
whether
the
police
officer’s
failure
to
advise
the
man
in
toto
of
his
constitutional
rights
was
inadvertent
or
whether
it
was
unintentional
or
whether
it
was
intentional.
similarly,
we
think
that
the
kind
of
questioning
that
goes
on
here
or
the
asking
the
defendant
to
continue
the
investigation
even
if
this
could
be
construed
as
an
intentional
violation
of
constitutional
rights
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case
we
don’t
think
it
rises
at
that
level.
we
still
think
that
the
policy
enunciated
in
harris
is
applicable
to
this
case.
simply
because
in
either
situation
as
the
court
held
the
prophylactic
purpose
of
miranda
is
sufficiently
served
by
keeping
the
statement
subsequently
obtained
out
of
the
case
in
chief;
but
keeping
it
available
to
prevent
perjury
a
possible
out
note
perjury
when
the
defendant
takes
to
stand
and
keeping
it
available
for
impeachment
purposes.
