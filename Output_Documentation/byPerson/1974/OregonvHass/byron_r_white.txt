justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
oregon
does
have
a
counterpart
of
the
self-incrimination
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
had
they
rested
this
decision
on
that
provision
you
would
not
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mckeen,
are
you
saying
something
like
this
that
you're
familiar
with
the
differences
among
us
of
this
court
on
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
obscenity
laws?
there
are
members
of
this
court
who
think
that
no
obscenity
law
is
constitutional
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment
and
there
are
others
who
think
there're
maybe
within
certain
limits
constitutionality
of
obscenity
laws.
now,
suppose
you
had
a
prosecution
under
the
obscenity
and
there
were
conviction
and
it
was
within
the
scope
of
the
principle
as
this
court
has
stated
that
are
permissible
to
a
state
but
your
supreme
court
would
to
say,
“i
don't
agree
within
majority
of
the
supreme
court.
we
agree
with
mr.
justice
douglas
that
no
obscenity
law
is
constitutional”
under
the
federal
constitution
and
with
the
reverse
the
conviction
on
that
ground.
are
you
suggesting
that
that
would
be
conclusive
on
the
state
of
oregon
because
that
was
a
holding
of
your
supreme
court
it
interpreted
the
federal
constitution.
has
it
thought,
it
ought
to
be
rather
than
the
way
this
court
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
makes
federal
constitution
more
restrictive.
it
can't
interpret
more
expansively
in
this
court
does
but
may
interpret
it
more
restrictively,
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no
question
about
that.
that
wasn’t
my
question
mr.
mckeen.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
counsel,
would
you
have
the
same
view
if
the
police
officer
were
sued
for
invading
someone's
constitutional
rights
and
a
word
of
damages
has
made
against
him
based
on
the
supreme
court
of
oregon’s
holding
and
he
said,
“well,
that
maybe
the
opinion
of
supreme
court
of
oregon
but
supreme
court
of
united
states
says,
that
“i
didn’t
violate
somebody’s
constitutional
right.
do
you
think
you
have
to
pay
the
damages
based
on
the
oregon?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
says
that
he’s
at
fault.
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
says
he
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
says,
“it
isn’t
proper
under
the
federal
constitution.
supreme
court
of
united
states
says,
“it
is.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
you're
suggesting
i
suppose
is
at
least
in
criminal
prosecution
while
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
can't
narrow
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
accuse
as
we
interpret
it.
it
can't
extend
them
if
it
wants.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
suggesting
as
i
gather
and
the
one
the
extensions
do
not
have
to
be
based
upon
the
state
constitution.
they
can
be
based
on
the
oregon
supreme
court's
reading
of
a
federal
constitution,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
some
authority
cited.
i
don't
know
much
about
them
in
your
brief
which
suggests
that
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
side
of
the
argument
is
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
it
is
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know.
does
it
then
make
a
difference?
what
if
you
lose
all
on
that?
what
if
you
are
sitting
here
as
authority,
reviewing
the
oregon
supreme
court
decision,
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
--
i'm
not
sure
but
i
think
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
is
one
supreme
court
it's
kind
of
rather
far
in
saying
that
it's
adopting
a
state
law
and
certain
decisions
of
this
court
and
i
have
some
recollection
the
owner
is
one
of
those.
incidentally,
i
think
you
opened
your
argument
by
suggesting
that
the
1967
brewton
should
be
read
in
any
event
as
a
decision
of
state
law
or
did
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
(voice
overlap)
is
rested
on
state
law
and
federal
law
or
which?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
say
it's
attached
to
the
petition
the
full
opinion
is
attached
to
the
petition,
page
38.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
agree
on
the
first
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
not
on
the
second?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don’t
--
i
thought
your
court
in
this
case
expressly
put
aside
this
whole
issue
that
didn’t
make
any
difference
what
this
rule
was
that
this
was
just
a
different
case,
completely
different
case
and
that
they
didn’t
have
to
interpret.
they
didn’t
certainly
didn’t
concede
here.
they
were
interpreting
the
federal
constitution
more
restrictively
in
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
some
indication
that
they
were
deciding
and
on
the
basis
of
federal
law
that’s
what
you
are
going
to
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
may
be
wrong
but
they
are
not
plainly
in
this
case
that
they
have
a
right
to
be
wrong.
