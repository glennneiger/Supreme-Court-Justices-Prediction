mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
the
state
indicated
and
some
of
the
justices
questioned
him
to
the
point
that
if
this
case
was
decided
on
state
grounds
that
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
would
have
no
jurisdiction
and
counsel
said
that
the
case
wouldn’t
be
here.
but
it
was
--
it's
my
understanding
that
this
court
is
also
expressed
a
doctrine
that
when
a
state
has
within
its
governmental
framework
the
mechanics
to
cure
any
problem
themselves
that
supreme
court
of
united
states
will
not
interfere
in
determining
how
they
should
interpret
the
constitutional
provisions.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
oregon
has
a
constitution
that
includes
very
similar
words
to
the
united
states
constitution.
they
will
have
the
opportunity
if
it
comes
before
them
in
appropriate
case
to
decide
whether
it
overruled
brewton
or
to
decide
whether
to
follow
the
federal
rule
as
set
out
in
harris
versus
new
york.
but
in
this
case,
whether
their
interpretation
was
correct
or
incorrect
there
was
still
an
interpretation
it's
more
restrictive
to
the
prosecution
than
that
of
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
and
this
court
has
said
many,
many
times
that
in
such
a
situation
the
states
are
free
to
adopt
their
own
rules
in
search
and
seizure.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
my
reading
of
the
case
is
i
didn't
believe
that
until
green
versus
california
but
it
appeared
to
me
that
within
as
long
as
the
state's
interpretation
even
of
the
federal
constitutional
provision
was
more
restrictive
then
there's
no
constitutional
question
before
this
court
because
no
one
rights
has
been
valid.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
i
wasn't
aware
of
that
your
honor.
i
was
aware
of
your
concurring
opinion
in
green
versus
california
which
i
thought
you
put
there
for
the
very
purpose
of
showing
that
the
states
are
free
to
adopt
their
own
rules
and
that
the
state
of
california
could
very
well
when
you
sent
the
case
back
had
very
well
resolve
it
the
same
way
and
you
are
trying
to
tell
i'm
not
to,
so
long
as
they
didn't
misinterpret
the
federal
constitution.
in
that
case,
green
versus
california,
the
california
legislature
had
passed
the
law
that
was
constitutional.
and
the
california
legislature
was
recognized
by
this
court
as
being
a
proper
party
to
legislate
for
california
and
california
supreme
court
erroneously
held
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
under
federal
law.
so,
this
put
a
federal
restriction
under
state
of
california
and
that
isn't
the
case
in
hass.
in
the
green
case,
there
was
a
restriction
put
on
the
legislature
to
pass
this
particular
law.
this
court
removed
that
restriction
by
holding
that
the
law
was
not
unconstitutional.
but
in
that
case,
the
state
had
a
proper
--
was
a
proper
standing
before
the
court
because
they
have
the
right
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
criminal
law.
the
case
just
before
the
court
here
state
of
oregon
versus
hass
how
do
we
get
by
the
opinion
that
this
court
or
the
statement
of
this
court
made
in
florida
versus
mellon
cited
in
my
brief.
this
court
can
have
the
right
to
pronounce
an
abstract
opinion
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
law.
such
law
must
be
brought
into
actually
threatened
operation
upon
rights
properly
falling
under
judicial
cognizance.
cooper
versus
california
--
our
holding
does
not
affect
the
state's
power
to
impose
higher
standards
on
searches
and
seizures.
kerr
versus
california
and
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
yes
your
honor
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying,
what
i
attempt
to
say
in
my
brief.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
really
make
difference.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
as
long
as
the
state
has
within
its
framework
the
mechanics
to
make
the
opinion
that
they
may
then
this
court
would
have
no
real
purpose
in
examining
those
opinions
unless
there
was
a
federally
protected
right
violated
or
a
constitutional
--
federally
constitutional
question
raised?
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
it
would
still
appear
to
me
your
honor
to
be
an
academic
opinion
of
this
court
if
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
chose
to
violate
no
one’s
constitutional
rights
and
still
make
a
finding
difference
in
this
court.
it’s
my
understanding
that
the
two
courts
are
parallel
to
each
other
that
this
isn't
the
court
to
stands
above
a
state
supreme
court
that
they
were
with
respect
for
each
other’s
opinion.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
that
was
my
understanding
and
your
honor
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said
that.
in
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said
in
the
florance
case
that's
cited
in
both
briefs
that
if
we
choose
we
can
continue
to
apply
this
interpretation.
we
can
do
so
by
interpreting
article
1,
section
9
of
the
oregon
constitution
prohibition
of
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
as
being
more
restrictive
than
the
fourth
amendment
at
that
time.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
i
understand
your
honor
but
in
the
next
sentence
was
your
question
or
we
can
interpret
the
fourth
amendment
more
restrictively
than
interpreted
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
now,
that
was
said
by
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
oregon.
if
--
it
would
appear
to
me
and
there
are
some
cases
that
have
cited
where
this
court
has
said
that
we're
not
here
concerned
if
the
constitution
--
if
an
act
is
unconstitutional
or
if
the
constitution
has
been
violated.
we're
concerned
only
if
the
proper
party
brings
a
proper
matter
before
this
court.
not,
this
isn't
the
forum
where
the
court
should
give
opinions
that
will
aid
persons
in
interpreting
the
law
unless
parties
before
there
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
no,
i'm
not
your
honor.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
the
oregon
supreme
court
from
the
text
of
their
opinion
in
hass
case
recognizes
the
importance
of
following
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
courts.
but
they
still
have
within
the
framework
of
the
judicial
system
in
oregon.
the
power
or
the
means
to
resolve
this
question
without
interfering
with
the
federal
constitution
and
therefore,
under
the
abstention
doctrine
that
this
court
has
stated
it
would
appear
to
me
that
this
court
should
have
no
real
interest
in
how
--
which
way
the
state
of
oregon
chooses
to
go.
i
understand
that
there's
been
statements
made
by
the
court
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
is
opposed
to
my
opinion
that
that
was
my
opinion.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
wouldn't
then
there
be
a
violation
of
the
police
officer's
constitute
federally
constituted
--
constitutional
rights
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
but
in
any
areas
your
honor
where
the
state
supreme
court
is
less
restrictive
and
certainly
not
contending
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
but
what
the
police
officer
if
he's
awarded
--
if
he's
required
to
pay
damages
when
his
act
was
proper
under
the
federal
constitution
then
i
don't
think
that
he
is
properly
before
this
court
on
a
federal
constitution.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
i
would
think
in
that
case
you
should
have
access
to
this
court.
they
don’t
believe
that’s
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
that
the
state
can
appeal
in
order
that
it
effects
their
property
interest
the
same
as
any
person
that
has
standing
before
this
court.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
i
believe
that
the
distinction
has
been
made
by
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
it
is
just
that
that
the
state
is
a
proper
party
when
the
suit
involves
its
property,
its
land,
a
situation,
let's
say
when
the
federal
government
wants
to
put
a
federal
part
with
interstate
involves
the
state's
own
proprietary
interest
and
then
there
a
proper
person
that
can
come
before
this
court.
but
they
have
no
property
rights
in
the
conviction
of
the
burglar.
they
have
no
real
interest
in
whether
the
oregon
supreme
court
is
more
restrictive
or
not
than
the
federal
supreme
court
--
the
state
of
oregon
has
no
interest
in
that.
there
they
are
to
follow
whatever
the
law
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
is
not
to
claim
any
interest
in
what
it
is
that
enforce
the
law
as
it
is.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
yes
your
honor
and
it
has
been
said
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
i
would
think
so
and
of
course
i
have
the
feeling
that
i'm
not
completely
right
on
that
but
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
cooper
versus
california
says
--
now,
this
was
cooper
versus
california
was
searched
where
the
state
had
a
statute
also
and
the
supreme
court
considered
the
case
only
as
to
whether
or
not
the
search
was
reasonable
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
they
said
the
state
is
free
if
it
chooses
to
do
so
without
review
by
us
to
apply
its
own
state's
harmless
error
rule
to
set
areas
of
state
law.
they're
being
no
federal
constitutional
area
here,
there's
no
need
for
us
to
determine
this
matter
and
that's
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
that
still
your
honor
is
the
way
that
i
would
think
it
would
be
if
i
can
follow
the
thread
of
the
fact
situation
correctly.
the
officer
has
his
citizen
of
united
states
under
the
federal
constitution
he
would
have
a
right
to
have
done
what
he
did
and
therefore
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
by
damages
and
he
should
have
proper
standing
before
this
court.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
they
did
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
absolutely
not
your
honor.
what
i
attempted
to
say
was
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
that
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
interpreted
harris
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
it's
in
my
feeling
that
they're
trying
the
case
and
through
their
record
it's
been
submitted
to
the
court
the
difference
is
clear
between
harris
and
hass
because
the
harris
case
was
an
unintentional
negligent
failure
to
say
some
magic
words
and
there
was
--
that's
all
it
was.
the
hass
case
the
defendant
was
fully
advised
of
his
rights.
the
police
officer
knew
he
was
advised
of
his
rights.
he
knew
they
had
the
right
to
a
lawyer.
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
the
police
officer
at
that
point
in
time
chose
to
continue
the
investigation
and
caused
this
boy
to
incriminate
himself.
i'm
pointing
out
bicycles,
i'm
pointing
out
a
house
that
the
bicycles
have
been
stolen
from.
and
so
at
that
point
in
time,
this
police
officer
knew
that
he
had
nothing
to
lose
by
purposely
violating
their
boy's
constitutional
rights
your
honor.
because
if
he
didn't
he
wouldn't
get
anything
and
if
he
gave
him
a
lawyer
any
lawyer
would
have
told
that
boy
that
quite
incriminating
himself.
so,
the
police
officer
knows,
it's
all
or
nothing
i
can
go
ahead
and
violate
his
constitutional
rights
take
a
chance
of
getting
the
statement
in
or
at
least
use
it
for
impeachment
purposes
and
that’s
better
than
stopping
the
investigation.
and
so,
they
have
affirmatively
and
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said
that's
where
it
based
its
difference
on
and
the
difference
is
there.
the
restriction
against
police
for
purposely
and
knowingly
violating
a
person's
constitutional
rights
in
face
of
the
knowledge
of
this
court's
requirements
is
a
difference
set
of
facts
than
an
intent
to
know
failure
to
say
words
that
are
necessary.
and
the
harris
case
said
that
also
the
harris
said,
“statements
otherwise
trustworthy.
some
of
the
cases
that
have
not
followed
the
harris
case
have
used
backward
reasoning.
there's
a
case
where
a
supreme
court
has
held
that
because
the
prior
statement
was
given
on
the
preliminary
hearing
then
harris
didn't
apply.
but
actually,
if
the
statement
was
given
of
the
preliminary
hearing
then
it
would
be
more
trustworthy
than
one
given
to
a
police
officer.
so,
states
refused
to
follow
harris
based
upon
reasons
that
aren't
really
related
to
anything
except
the
reasons
do
not
follow
harris.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
i'm
not
sure
if
that
was
--
this
was
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief
as
authority
for
the
states
that
had
followed
ahead
and
followed
harris.
but
i'm
not
sure
if
that
was
appeal
to
this
court
now.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
i
just
don't.
i
believe
that
that
is
accurate
commonwealth
versus
horner
453
pa.
435,
309
or
450
of
pennsylvania
435.
excuse
me.
309
a
2d
552
(1973).
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
no.
but
the
reason
that
they
didn't
follow
harris
was
circulated
i
mean
it
was
if
to
reverse
--
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
well,
your
honor
it
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
oregon
regardless
of
how
they
based
it.
mr.
sam
a.
mckeen
i
don't
know.
i
thought
that
i
had
a
copy
of
brewton
and
i
spent
some
time
since
i've
read
it.
my
friends
didn’t
--
