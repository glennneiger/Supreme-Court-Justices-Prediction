chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
arguments
next
in
73-1452,
oregon
against
hass.
mr.
denney,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
case
in
which
we
remanded
to
the
--
one
of
the
cases
we
remanded
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
to
ask
them
to
state
clearly
whether
they
acted
on
the
federal
or
the
state
constitution
or
was
that
another
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
relied
on
the
walter
case
as
much
as
the
court
did
in
harris?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
denney.
mr.
mckeen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
we
had
a
little
qualification
to
that
if
they
place
it
on
their
own
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
their
own
constitution
or
statutes
presumably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you
suppose
we
send
--
we
sent
some
of
those
cases
back
to
the
state
supreme
court
to
ask
him
to
make
it
clear
whether
they
were
acting
under
the
federal
or
under
their
state
constitution
if
that's
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
noticed
that
neither
you
nor
your
friends
have
cited
the
krivda
case,
are
you
familiar
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
i
think
perhaps
the
most
recent
case
which
we
sent
back
that
was
california
was
it?
the
california
supreme
court
and
said
please
in
fact
--
we
said,
please
tell
us
whether
you're
deciding
this
case
under
the
federal
constitution
or
under
your
own?
there
have
been
several
of
those
if
they
decided
and
under
their
own
constitution
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
that’s
their
responsibility
of
authority.
if
they’re
deciding
it
under
the
federal
constitution,
it's
ours.
that's
the
burden
of
this
krivda
case
and
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
response
about
reading
the
constitution
--
federal
constitution
more
expansively
then
the
--
it's
read
up
here
would
bring
you
right
against
the
proposition
mr.
justice
white
suggested
to
you
that
if
that
reading
then
imposed
a
liability
on
a
police
officer
for
damages
for
violating
the
fourth
amendment
or
any
other
provision
in
a
way
that
we
did
not
countenance
then
you
i
thought
did
say
that
the
officer
would
have
a
claim
that
his
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
have
been
violated
because
he
regarded
and
have
been
talked
to
regard
this
united
states
constitution
as
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
referring
to
any
state
cases
since
harris
and
which
they
sought
to
review
here
the
state
sought
to
review
here
or
did
the
state
just
acquiesce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
have
a
name
or
particular
case
in
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there's
no
indication
in
a
citation
that
the
certiorari
was
sought
and
denied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
denney,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
