justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
other
case,
oregon
against
hass
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
oregon.
it
presents
a
variation
of
a
fact
situation
encountered
by
the
court
in
the
case
of
harris
against
new
york
decided
here
four
years
ago.
mr.
hass,
as
a
suspect,
was
in
the
custody
of
a
state
police
officer.
he
had
been
given
full
miranda
warnings
and
then
a
little
later
he
told
the
state
officer
that
he
would
like
to
telephone
a
lawyer.
the
reply
was
that
this
could
not
be
done
until
the
officer
and
mr.
hass
reached
the
station.
mr.
hass
then
provided
inculpatory
information.
and
our
issue
here
is
whether
after
mr.
hass
took
the
stand
and
testified
in
a
manner
contrary
to
that
inculpatory
information
it
may
be
testified
to
by
the
state
officer
in
rebuttal
solely
for
impeachment
purposes
or
whether
on
the
other
hand
it
is
inadmissible
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
in
the
harris
case,
the
situation
was
identical
except
that
the
miranda
warnings
were
defective.
in
here,
they
were
not
defective.
the
state
trial
court
ruled
that
the
harris
decision
controlled
and
that
the
testimony
of
the
state
officer
was
admissible
for
impeachment.
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
reversed
feeling
that
an
oregon
case
decided
before
the
harris
decision
here
was
controlling.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
affirmed
by
a
sharply
divided
four-to-three
vote.
and
it
did
show,
we
hold
and
solely
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
and
hold
that
this
case
despite
its
slight
factual
differences
is
controlled
by
our
decision
in
harris
against
new
york.
and
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
