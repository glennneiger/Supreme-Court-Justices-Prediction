justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
prior
opinion
in
brewton
that
was
1967?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
federally
grounded
or
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reason
that,
may
i
just
ask?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reason
i
asked
is
that
this
apparently
was
a
situation
that
arose
before
miranda
was
decided.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
it
says
at
page
29
whether
or
not
miranda's
finding
upon
argument
in
courts
with
reference
to
trials
concluded
before
the
miranda
decision
was
published.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
or
not
in
either
event
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
they
applied
what
they
did
in
brewton
as
to
impeachment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
the
same
day
as
rendered
a
week
later.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
was
decided
in
1967
but
what
date
in
1967?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
relation
to
the
date
we
decided
to
johnson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
reason
i
asked
is
in
the
present
case
it
would
appear
at
page
15
that
your
court
cited
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can
read
it
i
suggest
this
way,
jointly
on
brewton
and
harris?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
brewton
was
contrary
to
harris
and
it
followed
brewton,
is
that
what
they
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
did
later
but
if
it
can
be
read
as
based
on
the
state
ground
even
if
it's
also
based
on
a
federal
ground
and
even
though
it's
erroneous
in
its
interpretation
of
federal
ground.
i
guess
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
review
it
if
it’s
based
partly
or
jointly
on
the
state
and
federal
ground,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
don't
we
have
to
decide
then
whether
the
original
brewton
was
decided
on
the
state
or
federal
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
is
that
language
i've
just
read
to
you
that
i
wasn't
clear
of
this
precisely
what
it
meant
whether
or
not
miranda?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
certainly
all
that
repercussion
of
29
and
30
is
in
relation
to
the
developing
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
this
court
had
developed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
was
the
middle
ground
in
tate.
i
haven't
read
tate.
brewton
gave
us
a
good
deal
of
attention
in
tate
v.
united
states
or
don't
you
waste
the
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mind
if
i
interrupt
you
once
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
brewton,
justice
perry
dissented
and
next
to
the
last
paragraph
at
page
33,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
this
court
should
go
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
that's
the
rule
and
so
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
that
suggest
that
he,
at
least
he
led
majority
opinion
in
brewton
is
going
beyond
any
decision
of
this
court?
