justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
donâ€™t
challenge
the
right
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
interpreting
its
own
search
and
seizure
constitutional
provisions
to
come
to
a
different
conclusion
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
contending
for
anything
more
than
that
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
or
the
oregon
legislature
has
a
right
under
state
law
or
state
constitutional
law
to
impose
more
rigorous
requirements
on
the
prosecution
and
being
imposed
by
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
saying
anything
more
than
that?
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
in
order
to
evaluate
your
point,
do
we
look
to
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
opinions
and
see
whether
they
were
--
appear
to
be
based
on
the
federal
constitution
or
on
the
oregon
constitution
as
well?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
you
have
a
wrong
long
line
of
cases
that
this
court
has
taken
where
there
have
been
appeals
by
the
state
from
a
judgment
of
the
state
supreme
court
saying
that
the
state
couldn't
impose
a
tax
on
a
potential
taxpayer
either
for
due
process
or
for
commerce
clause
reasons?
i
would
think
that
would
cut
against
your
reasoning
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
the
state
have
property
interest
under
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
have
any
greater
interest
in
collecting
revenues
that
in
enforcing
the
criminal
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
dicta
in
florance.
