justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
do
you
say
this
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
at
the
bottom,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
see.
this
is
from
the
same
judgment
that
you
brought
directly
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
we
combined
the
huntsville
case
and
your
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
separate
judgments
entered
in
each?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
brought
your
judgment
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
huntsville
did
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
from
the
closing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
closing
was
sought
to
a
temporary
or
permanent
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
says
i
gather
a
separate
equitable
proceeding
in
that
circumstance,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
take
a
separate
equitable
proceeding
to
get
the
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
about
--
what's
your
alabama
facts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
alabama
judicial
structure
has
a
separate
equity
court,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)--
put
on
its
equity,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
any
event,
the
statute
contemplates
a
separate
independent
equitable
proceeding
even
in
the
circumstances
of
the
conviction?
