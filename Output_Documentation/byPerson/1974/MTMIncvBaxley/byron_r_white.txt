let's
see,
i
gather
that
nuisance
statutes
are
in
title
7
and
the
obscenity
statutes
are
in
title
14
of
the
abatement
code?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
is
there
any
provision
which
interconnects
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
do
you
call
it
red
light
abatement
controller?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
fairly
old
statute
then,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
argue
in
the
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
time
expired?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
thus,
what
happened
to
the
huntsville?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
--
he
did
take
an
appeal
directly
from
whatever
this
injunction
was
temporary.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
dismissed
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
a
permanent
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
temporary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
be
fact
but
they
exist.
i
mean
the
state
--
there
is
a
state
to
tell
a
process
that
is
in
working
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
if
you'd
be
hearing
the
same
argument
if
that
started
the
criminal
case
against
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
different
prospect
but
it
would
be
just
as
slow
in
the
state
court
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
let's
assume
the
three-judge
court
is
quite
right
as
to
the
applicability
of
younger
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
hope
but
if
they
were
you're
in
trouble
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
issue
we've
got
to
decide
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
the
only
question
we
have
here,
the
younger
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
primary,
i'm
looking
at
the
jurisdictional
statement
that's
the
only
question
(voice
overlap).
is
that
right?
and
aren't
we
bound
or
we
rarely
disagree
with
the
lower
federal
courts
on
their
characterization
of
a
state
statute
and
here
the
three-judge
court
said
this
states
statute
is
aimed,
it's
a
quasi-criminal
and
it's
in
the
service
of
the
criminal
law.
that's
what
it
said
anyway,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
but
don't
we
usually
give
great
difference
to
the
lower
federal
courts
to
their
view
of
the
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
only
an
argument
isn't
it
mr.
smith
that
even
if
in
a
relation
as
the
three-judge
court
found
that
the
statutes
is
what
the
three--judge
court
said
it
was
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
you
say
you
still
within
the
exception?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
moved
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
took
no
action
to
dissolve
a
temporary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
to
the
temporary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
unpleasant.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
want
us
to
overrule
ex
parte
young?
justice
byron
r.
white
young?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
your
argument
you
might
not
be.
