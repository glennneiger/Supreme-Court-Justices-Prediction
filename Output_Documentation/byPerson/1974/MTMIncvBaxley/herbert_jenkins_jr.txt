mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
have
been
several
comments
made
in
mr.
smith's
presentation
that
are
misrepresentative
of
the
procedures
that
occurred
in
this
case.
i
don't
know
where
it
--
i
don't
believe
they
are
intentional
but
for
one
thing,
first
thing
they
did
out
file
the
injunction
procedure
in
the
circuit
court
on
march
the
7th
and
set
up
the
hearing
for
march
13th
and
gave
them
notice
of
it.
in
the
next
day
or
the
morning
of
the
hearing,
their
local
counsel
was
in
the
federal
courts
securing
a
--
filing
a
removal
petition
and
he
came
to
the
hearing
and
with
the
bond
order--
the
removal
order
and
present
it
to
the
circuit
judge
who
for
some
reason
i
forgot
to
take
in
the
county
wouldn't
accept
it
but
i
had
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
get
that
perfected.
in
the
meantime,
he
said
that
we're
going
to
have
a
hearing
and
we
have
the
hearing
and
while
he
was
over
that
getting
a
thing
removed
and
so
they
did
remove
and
i
filed
a
motion
to
remand
immediately.
and
we
had
a
hearing
on
that
and
got
the
case
remanded
to
the
circuit
court
and
proceeded
to
set
another
hearing
that
we
were
going
to
have.
and
in
the
meantime
they
filed
this
present
action.
it
involved
--
there
was
already
a
pending
another
case
as
he
talked
about
that
is
on
appeal
and
it
was
argued
at
the
alabama
supreme
court
which
was
separate
from
this
case
the
city
of
huntsville
case.
and
they
had
already
been
filed
another
case
by
earl
morgan,
the
district
attorney
of
jefferson
county
in
a
separate
case
which
involved
the
mobile
bookmart
which
is
a
store
--
bookstore
located
downtown
across
the
street
from
the
federal
building.
this
theater
that
i
filed
an
injunction
against
is
located
in
eastern
section
city
of
birmingham
and
contains
in
the
front
of
little
bookstore
in
addition
to
the
theater
and
that's
operated
by
mtm
incorporated.
this
whole
title
of
the
case
got
switched
around,
the
other
party
--
the
huntsville
case
did
not
appeal
from
the
three-judge
court
order
in
this
case
electing
to
go
ahead
and
perfect
their
appeal
in
the
state
court.
in
this
case
was
appealed
mr.
--
attorney
general
baxley
was
named
because
he
is
required
to
have
notice
in
this
type
of
actions
and
earl
morgan
was
named
because
he
is
the
party
from
those
relations
in
this
case
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
bookstore
downtown.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
motion
to
--
they
removed
that
case
also
for
the
federal
court
and
there
was
a
motion
filed
to
remand
in
that
case
which
was
never
ruled
upon
because
this
hearing
--
this
case
was
filed
in
a
consolidated
and
immediately
all
three
of
these
cases.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
jurisdictional
question
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
court
could
intervene
in
the
matter
and
set
it
down
for
hearing
in
due
course.
now,
it's
very
complicated,
the
record
is
not
here
before
the
court
as
to
what
exactly
happened
and
of
course,
i
guess
they
consider
this
particular
narrow
question
of
whether
the
younger
versus
harris
principle
applied
in
this
particular
case.
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
but
in
order
that
this
court
might
consider
this
principle
of
younger
versus
harris
whether
or
not
it
involves
the
criminal
prosecution.
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
--
in
my
complaint,
he
made
a
statement
that
there
were
some
15
cases.
but
on
the
contrary,
we
began
this
matter
when
the
theater
opened
in
september
of
1970
and
it
went
to
march
of
1973
when
the
injunction
in
this
circuit
court
was
issued
and
up
to
that
time
they
showed
something
like
a
125
to
130
movies.
and
which
everyone
was
named
in
my
complaint
before
the
circuit
court
and
it
was
made
in
exhibit
to
their
complaint
in
the
federal
court
and
started
per
date
except
for
about
two
months
when
the
newspapers
refused
to
take
advertisements.
but
in
disperse
out
of
the
internet
time
over
125
or
130-week
period
we
made
30
cases.
some
was
kept
a
few
weeks
but
they
were
in
dispersed
between
the
whole
period
of
time
of
130
cases.
some
might
they
may
go
five
weeks
and
some
a
month
but
we
did
get
a
good
sampling
of
them.
amd
some
of
the
titles
were
--
the
ranch
and
interstellar,
sex
and
single
vampire,
jim
and
peg,
the
other
of
the
bed,
class
of
'69,
dollars
of
satan,
miles
falls
in
love,
harvey
swings,
bitter
cherry,
flash
to
flash,
i'll
do
everything,
lolita's
lollipop,
man
blower,
sandra
bowler,
lowly
housewife,
and
so
on
and
including
the
ones
30
cases
we
have.
now,
those
30
cases
there
were
30
convictions
in
recorder's
court.
all
of
which
were
appealed
to
circuit
court
to
the
criminal
division
for
trial
de
novo.
now,
of
those
30,
there
are
18
cases
that
were
tried
and
they
were
reconviction
in
every
case.
there
are
some
--
the
rest
of
them
are
still
pending
except
for
three
cases
that
he
mentioned
which
did
result
in
acquittal
of
the
defendant
just
recently
which
of
course
i
could
explain
to
the
court
but
it's
a
the
jury
returned
one
verdict
in
case
said
it
--
they
were
reluctant
in
and
found
them
not
guilty
because
of
the
rulings
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
that
they
didn't
think
our
pre-miller
ordinance
had
defined
that
the
man
to
the
defendant
exactly
what
he
could
and
could
not
do
or
this
best
fits
the
matter.
but
anyway
the
matter
came
on
to
be
heard
before
the
three-judge
district
court
and
on
the
face
of
--
bill
filed
in
the
district
court
showed
that
this
was
a
criminal
matter
that
was
filed
in
accordance
with
the
state
statute
that's
been
mentioned
which
is
in
title
7.
and
it
does
has
a
different
section
and
then
i
think
mr.
clansey
read
it
and
it
require
--
excuse
me
â€“
it
says,
the
nuisance
established
in
the
criminal
action
of
the
proceedings
under
this
article
in
case
the
existence
of
such
nuisance
is
established
in
a
criminal
proceeding
in
the
court
not
having
an
equitable
jurisdiction.
the
solicitor
or
prosecuting
officer
shall
proceed
promptly
under
this
article
to
enforce
the
provisions
and
penalties
thereof
and
the
findings
of
the
defendant
guilty
in
such
criminal
proceedings
unless
reverse
are
set
aside
shall
be
conclusive
as
against
the
defendant
as
to
the
existence
of
the
nuisance
and
so
forth.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
sir?
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
it
just
says
in
a
--
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
you
do
--
you
have
to
go
into
the
equity
court
after
you
have
the
convictions.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
since
july
of
1973
we've
adopted
the
civil
rules
of
practice
which
are
similar
to
the
federal
and
now
they've
done
away
with
it
but
we
still
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
but
we
still
keep
it
divided,
the
equity
judge
is
still
lay
and
they
still
handle
the
automatic
to
refer
him
to
the
equity
division
anyway.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
that's
right.
even
after
we
had
these
30
convictions
that
contemplates
a
separate
action.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
well,
i
play
it
safe,
i
introduced
certified
copies
of
the
convictions
are
both
and
recorder's
court
and
those
that
we
had
convictions
in
the
circuit
court.
and
in
addition,
i
have
to
recorder's
court
judge
and
the
circuit
court
judge
who
heard
all
those
cases
testify.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
they
were
admitted
and
there
were
evidence
and
proof
of
the
convictions
as
previously
mentioned.
whereupon
the
judge
issued
a
temporary
injunction
not
a
temporary
restraining
orders
as
mr.
smith
mentioned.
in
the
title
7
in
the
other
provisions
of
appeal
from
those
types
of
injunction
provides
that
within
10
days
of
the
issuance
of
such
an
order,
an
appeal
may
be
taken
to
the
state
supreme
court.
and
there
is
accelerated
procedure
for
filing
the
transcript
in
the
briefs.
this
proceed
--
this
appeal
was
not
taken
as
i
stated
this
suit
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
in
the
interim
and
so
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
order.
then
upon
my
having
applied
for
a
permit
to
injunction
they
wanted
to
wait
the
decision
of
this
case
and
by
agreement
we
continued
and
it's
still
being
continued
pending
the
outcome
of
this
matter
but
he
is
still
entitled
to
permanent
--
on
hearing
on
a
permanent
injunction.
and
incidentally,
after
six
months
if
no
one
does
push
for
final
hearing
on
ordinary
circumstances
the
temporary
injunction
will
expire.
but
that
was
my
agreement
have
continued
also.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
of
the
appendices
of
this
litigation.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
no,
sir,
they
loss
that
because
they
only
had
10
days
and
they
did
not
take
advantage
of
it.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
was
not
issued
in
this
case
would've
been
issued
to
ex
parte.
this
was
not
issue,
this
temporary
injunction
was
issued
after
a
hearing
and
based
on
their
filed
complaint
which
they
bypass
by
skipping
in
order
to
go
to
the
court
to
get
--
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
well,
after
the
temporary
injunction
is
issued
and
there
is
no
appeal
taken
from
it
within
10
days
which
is
provided
by
the
statute
then
after
six
months
if
the
either
party
hasn't
attempted
to
set
it
down
for
a
final
hearing
on
the
question
whether
the
injunction
should
be
made
permanent
which
is
permanent
until
such
a
final
hearing,
then
it
automatically
expires
if
no
attempt
is
made
to
had
it
set
down
for
a
final
hearing.
so
it
would
not
be
in
effect
after
six
months.
so,
in
the
district
court,
three-judge
court
was
appointed
and
the
matter
was
taken
under
advice
on
us
to
younger
versus
harris
principle
is
being
applicable.
and
we
argued
in
brief
that
it
was
a
quasi-criminal
matter
that
it
was
in
aid
of
the
criminal
statute
--
the
nuisance
statute
that
i
have
mentioned
under
which
it
was
proceeded
on
the
procedure,
it
was
instituted.
and
the
three-judge
court
ruled
that
it
was
on
the
basis
of
several
things.
they
talked
about
mitchum
versus
foster
and
said
that
they
required
irreparable
injury
or
unusual
circumstances
which
didn't
exist
in
this
case
and
they
stated
that
in
the
order,
that's
in
the
appendix
that
he
referred
to
previously.
and
stated
in
fact
that
this
case
did
not
involve
and
i
think
it
surmise
it
to
the
ordinary
circumstance
in
here
in
this
particular
type
of
proceeding,
that's
the
nuisance
that
is
going
to
involve
loss
of
profit
and
those
things.
but
the
court
deemed
this
to
be
an
action
in
the
nature
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
of
course
the
ruling
that
are
residing
for
several
fifth
circuit
case
is
mainly
the
one
of
duke
versus
texas,
477
f.2d
and
which
the
fifth
circuit
told
that
court
that
applications
of
the
principles
of
supreme
court
as
younger
versus
harris
decision
involved
in
the
matter
of
the
federal
court
enjoining
a
state
court
proceeding
should
not
depend
upon
such
labels
or
civil
or
criminal
but
rather
it
should
be
governed
by
analysis
of
the
competing
interest
that
each
case
presents.
and
so,
that
is
that
the
younger
principles
of
equity
come
in
federalism
applied
to
federal
intervention
in
state
civil
as
well
as
criminal
proceedings
even
where
they
exercise
the
first
amendment
rights
is
involved.
so,
the
question
that
has
been
raised
here
several
times
this
afternoon
on
regarding
the
application
of
the
younger
versus
harris.
i
think
it's
pretty
well
covered
in
the
order
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
those
cases
cited
and
i
adopt
that
argument
and
i
supported
and
i
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
indicate
that
if
we
don't
have
some
kind
of
a
stop
to
people
running
to
the
federal
court
in
this
particular
instances
that
we're
in
a
fact
being
precluded
from
stopping
any
kind
of
pornography
because
as
indicated.
they
showed
this
films
over
two-and-a-half
year
period
and
we
undertook
as
much
prosecution
as
we
could
and
they
wanted
us
to
resort
to
individual
prosecutions
in
each
case
where
obscenity
occurred
which
we
did
and
it's
voluminous,
it's
tedious,
it's
weary
and
it's
exasperating
--
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
and
unpleasant
and
you
cannot
stop
pornography
that
way.
and
if
it
is
against
the
law
as
this
court
says
over
and
over
again
then
i
think
the
--
there
is
some
equity
and
comity
and
federalism
in
upholding
this
court's
decision
in
this
case.
this
case
was
taken
in
institute
in
the
name
of
the
state
of
alabama
or
my
relation
in
my
case
known
in
relation
to
earl
morgan
and
the
other
case
and
i
think
the
court
overlooked
my
argument
and
that
in
regard
to
the
fact
the
i
think
it's
an
action
against
the
state
of
alabama
in
one
which
would
fit
under
then
reasoning
of
larson
versus
domestic
in
foreign
commerce
corporation
case
6
and
in
that
supreme
court
1457.
in
that,
i
did
not
act
ultra
vires,
i
had
the
authority
to
do
what
i
did.
its
--
its
fact,
it
says
that
i
shall
do
it.
one
of
the
reasons
we
didn't
do
it
sooner
it
was
because
of
this
case
has
came
up
before
miller
and
some
were
afraid
at
that
time
that
this
court
not
render
the
opinion
making
pornography
legal
for
consenting
adults.
they
operate
this
theater
within
those
that
limit
that
is
advertised
for
adults
only.
and
another
--
and
also
that
if
it's
unconstitutionality
that
our
questioning
in
such
an
action
they
must
state
that
they
have
illegal
right,
illegal
protective
right
which
is
being
denied
by
the
state.
in
this
case,
if
the
pornography
is
illegal,
as
i
believe
it
is,
then
the
ordinance
that
the
statute
has
been
held
in
80
drive-in
theatres
versus
baxley
and
the
state
case
that
i
cited
in
to
go
holding
that
this
--
by
the
state
of
alabama
that
this
is
quasi-criminal
matter.
then,
it's
not
an
unconstitutional
statute,
it's
merely
one
that
they
claimed
and
may
have
been
but
applied
unconstitutional.
and
also,
in
attempt
to
avoid
the
state
form
from
deciding
the
issue.
so,
if
this
is
a
state
matter,
the
state
is
not
a
person
under
section
1983
and
they
would
have
to
jump
those
two
hurdles
to
get
out
from
under
that.
so
i
think
that
we're
not
really
a
proper
part
anyway
and
that
we
should
been
dismissed
even
on
that
ground,
but
the
kenosha
versus
bruno
case
held
was
municipality
case
but
it
did
hold
that
in
this
equity
relief,
our
damages
would
be
applicable
to
state
or
subdivision,
i
mean
to
municipality
and
i
think
that
that
also
includes
the
state
county
or
municipality
or
the
reason
it
would.
and
so,
the
equity
relief
that
they're
seeking
even
though
they
are
not
seeking
damages
would
be
improper
against
the
state
of
alabama.
so,
the
gibson
versus
berryhill
case
--
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
ex
parte,
sir?
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
know
ex
parte
you're
speaking.
i'm
not
speaking
about
the
younger
versus
harris.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
familiar
with
the
ex
parte
young.
mr.
herbert
jenkins,
jr.
and
i
--
i
read,
i
just
merely
--
i
alternate
is
an
alternative
to
some
extent
to
show
that
i
think
that
of
course
i
realize
that
state
officials
can
be
sued
but
i
was
trying
to
say
that
it
was
--
well,
action
against
the
state
and
not
myself
and
that
should
--
could
be
consideration.
but
the
title
of
that
act
is
not
a
red
light
act
someone
had
mentioned.
i
did
want
to
clarify
that
it's
a
--
the
title
of
it
is
abatement
of
certain
nuisances.
they
defined
the
nuisance
as
a
place
upon
which
as
defined
above
upon
which
lewdness,
assignation
or
prostitution
is
conducted,
permitted,
or
continued,
or
exists.
so
it's
not
just
that
and
definition
of
lewdness
has
been
held
to
be,
it's
none
as
i
believe
with
the
obscenity
and
it's
the
word
broader
than
assignation
and
prostitution,
and
involves
open
in
public
indecency
and
includes
i
think
obscenity.
so,
i
think
its
action
was
properly
brought
and
is
a
quasi-criminal
matter
and
the
principles
of
younger
versus
harris
do
applied
to
it.
