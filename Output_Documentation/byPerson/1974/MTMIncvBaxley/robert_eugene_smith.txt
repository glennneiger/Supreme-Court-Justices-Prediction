mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
this
case
is
a
little
different
from
the
one
you
just
heard.
in
this
case,
there
was
an
action
brought
by
mr.
jenkins
who
as
an
assistant
city
attorney
in
the
city
of
birmingham
in
equity
court
seeking
to
permanently
enjoin
the
maintenance
of
a
nuisance
at
the
pussycat
adult
theater
and
a
bookstore.
the
state
of
alabama
unlike
the
state
of
ohio
was
proceeding
under
the
red
light
abatement
statute.
there
was
no
provision
for
a
one
year
closing.
there
was
no
maximum
or
minimum
set.
this
was
simply
and
purely
going
under
the
red
light
abatement
statute.
the
proof
in
this
case
was
adduced
by
mr.
jenkins
was
that,
certain
people
who
worked
for
the
corporation
had
been
convicted
in
the
recorder's
court
which
is
the
first
level
of
court
for
violation
of
the
obscenity
laws
of
the
city
of
the
birmingham.
they
have
a
city
ordinance
for
violation
of
obscenity
laws.
there
were
approximately
15
cases
which
have
been
made
most
of
which
have
been
tried
before
the
recorder's
court.
all
of
which
had
been
appealed
at
the
--
or
were
in
the
process
of
being
appealed.
since
that
time,
the
only
three
cases
with
the
appeal
your
honors
goes
to
de
novo
to
the
next
court
--
circuit
court
and
which
there
is
a
jury
trial
on
issue
of
obscenity
and
parenthetically
speaking
the
only
three
cases
are
going
to
trial
all
resulted
in
acquittals
for
the
defendant.
but
yet,
it
was
this
evidence
of
the
violation
of
the
--
alleged
violation
of
the
law
before
the
recorder's
court
and
instead
of
the
other
12
that
were
still
pending
and
have
not
yet
been
tried
in
the
circuit
court.
so,
every
--
what
we
have
is
the
evidence
of
convictions
that
the
lowest
court
when
appeals
were
allowable
in
the
next
level
with
the
circuit
court.
that
was
the
criminal
process,
what
the
prosecution
or
what
mr.
jenkins
tried
to
do
here
was
a
civil
proceeding
and
a
purely
civil
proceeding
which
is
not
ipso
facto
or
necessarily
ancillary
to
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws
because
the
criminal
laws
were
proceeding
and
the
rational
is
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
but
what
he
did
is
attempt
to
go
in
and
to
close
up
the
theater
because
yesterday
they
sold
obscene
books
or
films
which
they
exhibited
and
tomorrow
you
may
do
so.
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
it's
entirely
different
and
i
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir
and
the
state
of
alabama
has
not
interpreted
its
red
light
abatement
statute
to
include
or
exclude.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
because
that's
the
term
that
it
was
given
at
the
time,
it
was
originally
passed
your
honor.
it
was
designed
to
close
beer
house,
saloons,
pool
halls
and
places
of
prostitution
where
you
punish
somebody
for
having
gone,
committed
prostitution,
they
go
back
and
open
up
again
and
open
up
again
and
open
up
again,
you
try
to
close
that
business.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
there
is
a
new
address.
it
has
a
theater
that
is
operated
by
one
corporation.
there
is
bookstore
in
the
lobby
that
is
operated
by
another
corporation
much
like
these
gem
department
stores
where
there
are
at
least
sections
in
the
store.
this
is
what
we
had
at
this
particular
location,
two
corporations,
one
location,
one
operating
the
theater
and
one
operating
the
bookstore.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
never
interpreted
that
question
of
whether
or
not
their
statute
applies
to
theaters,
adult
theaters
and
adult
bookstores.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
--
in
the
equity
proceeding,
yes
sir.
that
was
raised
but
the
judge
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
that
is
all
that
is
involved.
here
is
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
we
have
placed
at
the
beginning
of
the
appendix
in
this
case,
order
upon
prayer
for
temporary
injunction.
now,
incidentally
your
honors
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
your
honor
that's
true.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
this
was
notice
and
hearing.
yes
sir,
much
like
our
--
i
think
rule
45
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
kind
of
thing
where
an
attempt
is
made
to
notify
the
other
people.
now,
in
the
--
what
counsel
then
did
on
behalf
of
mtm
and
the
other
plaintiff
is
to
file
an
action
in
federal
court
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
which
it
asked
for
the
convocation
of
three-judge
court
to
determine
constitutionality
of
the
utilization
of
the
red
light
statute
either
as
written
or
as
applied
by
the
prosecutor
in
this
particular
case.
the
--
there
was
a
co-defendant,
i'm
sorry
--
a
co-plaintiff
separate
case
entirely
different
by
the
name
of
general
corporation
which
had
faced
the
same
problem
and
i
think
some
huntsville,
alabama
and
in
that
case,
they
also
were
closed
by
court
order
and
the
three-judge
federal
court
joined
both
cases
for
the
purpose
of
argument
and
disposition.
and
thus,
the
decision
in
essence
applies
to
both
sets
of
cases.
again,
parenthetically
speaking
we
proceeded
remaining
the
mtm
and
the
other
corporation
operating
the
theater
and
bookstore
preceded
by
following
a
jurisdictional
statement
and
sought
to
seek
the
relief
for
this
court
from
the
denial
of
the
injunction.
the
other
corporation
--
general
corporation
decided
to
go
forward
in
the
state
courts
after
the
three-judge
court
threw
them
out.
when
they
did
so
in
spite
of
the
comment
by
judge
pointer
in
his
decision
that
there
is
a
procedure
in
alabama
where
you
can
sort
of
expedite
your
--
that's
on
page
a-99
of
the
appendix.
he
said
that
in
alabama
permanent
injunctions
are
appealable
and
temporary
injunctions
may
be
made
appealable
by
appropriate
motions
and
both
types
of
appeals
are
given
expedited
preferential
treatment
by
statute.
now,
let
me
tell
you
about
the
preferential
treatment
by
statute
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that's
on
a-99
and
a-100
your
honor
of
the
appendix
of
appellants.
i'm
quoting
from
judge
pointer's
ruling.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
and
the
--
what
i
said
in
to
the
court
is
that
the
co-plaintiff
general
corporation
thereafter
appeal
to
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
this
--
it
was
a
co-plaintiff
in
the
same
case.
it
was
not
an
appeal
from
the
same
judgment.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
was
in
huntsville.
pardon
me.
huntsville.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
in
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
after
the
three-judge
court
denied
the
injunction,
they
then
entered
an
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
closing
in
huntsville.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
permanent
injunction
there
sir.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
there
is
no
--
we
suggest
there
is
no
appeal
for
a
temporary
injunction
in
the
state
of
alabama
there
is
a
--
you
can
file
a
separate
motion
to
dissolve
which
is
a
separate
proceeding
but
your
honors
we
had
filed
our
federal
suit
prior
to
that
temporary
injunction.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
alright,
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
after
the
three-judge
court
said,
we
deny
the
injunction.
he
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
alabama
and
your
honors
that
appeal
was
argued
october
15,
1974
and
there
is
no
and
has
been
no
disposition
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
appeal
was
not
dismissed,
there
was
the
appeal
brought
by
general
from
a
final
order
in
their
case
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that's
correct.
but
what
i'm
pointing
out
is
that
although
judge
pointer
says
that
these
things
can
be
given
expedited
preferential
treatment
by
statute.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
case
still
has
not
been
decided.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
i'm
always
saying
sir
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
court
said,
“well,
maybe
we
ought
not
deal
with
this
question.”
it's
because
there
is
a
basis
where
you
can
go
for
an
appeal
that
is
expedited
in
preferential
and
i'm
saying
that
although
that
may
be
true
in
theory
is
not
true
in
fact.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
and
that
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
could
be
your
honor
but
i
say
that
october
15th
was
the
day
of
the
argument
and
that's
october
1974
and
this
decision
by
judge
pointer
was
october
1973.
so,
it
took
a
full
year
after
which
to
give
it
that
expedited
preferential
treatment
is
what
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
i
think
we
have
a
different
prospect
here.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
but
then
we
have
the
younger
versus
harris
problem.
it
will
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
i
just
happen
to
think
they're
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we're
not
in
trouble
sir
because
we
still
have
the
permanent
injunction
which
is
not
yet
been
heard.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
think
that
that's
the
primary
question,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that's
what
they
said,
yes
sir.
however,
the
court
would
disagree
that
it's
quasi-criminal
because
this
unlike
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
think
it
was
the
view
that
they
placed
on
it
your
honor
because
they
took
the
fifth
circuit
decision
of
palaio
versus
mcauliffe
and
i
think
they
misapplied
that
particular
case
because
if
the
court
will
look
at
that
case.
what
occurred
there
is
there
were
independent
seizures
and
aid
of
the
criminal
process
which
was
the
first
step
in
making
a
criminal
case
to
have
a
trial
--
a
criminal
trial
and
counsel
in
that
case
rushed
in
the
federal
court
and
said
this
was
improper
and
sought
to
seek
the
aid
of
the
federal
court.
judge
edenfield
denied
that
aid
because
he
said,
this
is
part
of
the
criminal
process,
you
can
vindicate
your
right
ultimately
in
the
criminal
process.
we
cannot
vindicate
our
right
in
a
criminal
process
and
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
case
is
not
applicable
to,
i
say,
its
good
law.
but
it
is
not
applicable
to
this
situation
because
the
criminal
process
is
going
on
independent
your
honors
of
what
is
attempted
here
in
this
particular
case.
this
court
has
said
that
in
even
in
a
criminal
case
in
younger
--
in
mitchum
versus
foster
referring
towards
younger
versus
harris
doctrine.
it
talks
about
the
fact
that
even
if
in
criminal
case
the
court
purely
clear
left
room
for
federal
injunctive
intervention
in
a
pending
state
court
prosecution
and
certain
exceptional
circumstances
where
reputable
injury
is
both
great
and
immediate
and
where
the
state
law
has
flagrantly
and
patently
violative
expressed
constitutional
provision
or
where
there's
a
showing
of
bad
faith,
harassment,
or
other
unusual
circumstances
that
we
call
for
equitable
relief.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
had
a
brief
moment
to
review
it.
i
know
that
the
court
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
right,
but
they
did
not
say
we
do
not
have
standing
to
be
before
the
court
in
that
case.
in
fact,
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
they
did
not
raise
--
say
that
we
had
no
standing
to
be
before
the
court
in
that
case
that
we
had
not
raised
substantial
question.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
the
court
did
say
and
i
point
at
a-100
of
the
appendix
that
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
alabama
nuisance
statute
here
in
question
are
“flagrantly
and
patently
violative
of
express
constitutional
prohibitions.”
in
this
particular
concept,
they
go
on
to
say
it
may
be
possible
the
alabama
supreme
court
might
construe
these
statutes
as
in
applicable.
so,
they
expressed
no
opinion
on
the
particular
merits
to
this
particular
case.
so,
we
say
your
honors
that
under
the
decision
of
zwickler
versus
koota
authored
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
chose
the
forum
of
the
federal
courts.
we
did
so
because
there
was
no
order
against
us
at
that
time
so
to
speak
and
this
was
a
--
we
think
a
purely
civil
case
putting
the
title
on
quasi-criminal.
i
think
it's
a
misapplication
of
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
palaio
versus
mcauliffe
and
we
feel
that
even
if
the
court
agreed
with
the
determination
interpreting
a
statute
is
being
quasi-criminal,
we
think
that
we
still
have
demonstrated
the
extra
ordinary
circumstances
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
total
closing
and
succession.
and
the
point
is
you
can
operate
anything,
i
mean
you
can
put
in
--
if
you
put
in
carnal
knowledge
and
the
judge
barbour
felt
that
carnal
knowledge
might
have
offended
the
law
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
june.
he
could've
held
the
employees
and
contempt
and
put
them
in
jail
immediately
for
civil
contempt
because
they
had
shown
the
movie
which
he
later
thought
might
possibly
be
obscene.
and
the
theaters
have
been
closed
from
may
1973
to
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
and
of
course
we
--
when
we
participated
--
counsel
participated
in
the
proceedings
before
judge
barbour,
he
did
so
in
citing
of
course
england
versus
board
of
medical
examiners
where
there
because
we
have
to
be.
we
--
we
do
not
wish
to
abandon
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
that
we're
trying
to
acquire
and
try
to
promote
our
cause
that
way.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
there
is
no
need
to
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
pretend
because
we
have
a
temporary
restrain
injunction.
there
is
no
appeal
from
the
temporary
injunction.
we
must
do
something
affirmative
that
is
to
say
file
a
motion
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
we
took
the
position
that
under
england
versus
board
of
medical
examiners
if
we
took
that
affirmative
action
we
might
very
well
be
then
usurp
it
at
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
and
thus,
we
can't
very
well
take
the
affirmative
action
in
citing
england
versus
board
of
medical
examiners
at
the
same
time
in
order
to
go
for
with
them.
so,
we
did
not
for
that
reason,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
i
would
appreciate
that.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i'd
like
to
have
till
friday,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
alright
sir,
thank
you.
i'll
only
take
about
three.
the
counsel
referred
to
the
decision
of
80
drive-in,
inc.
versus
baxley,
this
was
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it's
in
the
brief
468,
f.2d
611.
in
that
case,
the
federal
court
--
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
use
its
nuisance
law
--
public
nuisance
law
and
a
manner
to
where
here
there
was
drive-in
theater,
it
was
showing
x-rated
films,
there
were
traffic
problems
being
created
and
in
that
specific
instance
much
like
i
think
the
case
crime
in
rabe
from
the
state
of
washington,
rabe
versus
washington
where
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
think
pointed
out
that
that
could
be
a
special
problem
that
might
be
resolved
by
nuisance
actions.
that
is
not
involved
here.
we
have
theater
it's
closed.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
know
sir,
there're
young
people
going
by
and
of
course
the
same
thing
would
be
necessary
true
here.
so,
i
don't
think
that
this
decision
of
80
drive-in
inc.
versus
baxley
and
i
was
referring
to
the
court's
concurring
opinion
and
there
where
you
talked
i
believe
about
the
fact
that
this
could
be
dealt
and
might
be
dealt
with
this
nuisance
and
i
think
that's
what
that
decision
holds
for
and
i
don't
think
it's
applicable
to
the
case
here
at
bar.
secondly,
i
understand
from
mr.
--
from
counsel
that
there
has
been
no
stipulation
entered
into
by
the
parties
that
the
judge
on
his
motion
judge
barbour
on
his
motion
has
continued
the
hearing
or
any
permanent
injunction.
we
are
not
going
to
ask
for
it
unless
we
be
usurp
from
our
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
i
suppose
the
prosecution
is
not
asked
for.
and
we
suggest
in
final
conclusion
that
the
court
dismissed
our
case
and
we
feel
that
if
they
felt
that
the
state
supreme
court
should
rule
on
the
matter
abstention
and
they
abstained
then
they
should've
retained
jurisdiction
under
the
theory
of
law
but
this
court
has
espoused
including
more
recently
american
trial
lawyers
association
versus
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
we
think
the
court
erred
absolutely
flat
out
dismissing
the
case
and
should
have
retained
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
but
if
the
court
if
you
will
remember
the
opinion
of
the
judge
they
suggested
and
it
was
a
mixed
bag
that
in
this
instance
we
have
not
gotten
to
a
younger
versus
harris
problem
but
we
hadn't
got
into
the
special
circumstances
there
because
the
state
court
could
construe
the
statute
in
a
manner
which
would
take
the
federal
constitutional
question
out
of
it.
and
if
it
did
that,
then
the
special
circumstances
in
younger
v.
harris
are
not
present.
so,
that's
why
i'm
saying
it
is
relevant
and
that's
the
point
i
was
making
that
i
felt
that
under
those
circumstances
then
this
is
not
--
they
were
not
deciding
it
on
pure
younger
grounds
and
i
think
under
this
circumstance,
they
should
retain
jurisdiction
even
if
not
dismissed.
thank
you,
your
honors,
and
may
have
the
friday
then
to
respond
to
the
court's
latest
decision?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
