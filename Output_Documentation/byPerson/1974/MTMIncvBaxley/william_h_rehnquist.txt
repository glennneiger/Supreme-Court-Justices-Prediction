h.

mr.
smith,
did
i
understand
you
say
a
moment
ago
that
it's
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
never
decided
whether
it's
red
light
abatement
statutes
apply
to
the
theater
showing
what
this
type
of
(voice
overlap,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
raise
that
argument
in
the
circuit
court
proceeding
--
the
equity
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
wait
a
minute,
you
say
order
upon
prayer
for
temporary
injunction.
my
understanding
with
temporary
restraining
order
is
something
that
issued
ex
parte
without
notice
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
--
is
this
a
temp
--
what
i
would
call
a
temporary
injunction
either
affidavits
or
some
testimony
but
at
least
with
after
notice
and
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yours
is
being
argued
december
10,
1974
and
it
hasn't
been
decided.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
be
that
the
supreme
court
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
--
mr.
smith,
with
the
time
sequence
in
this
case
that
first,
mr.
jenkins
filed
his
action
in
the
equity
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
filed
your
action
three-judge
district
court
then
the
equity
court
issued
with
the
temporary
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
the
equity
court
or
the
chancellor
take
some
sort
of
notice
or
is
there
some
sort
of
res
judicata
effect,
do
i
gather
from
your
reading
of
that
language
as
a
result
of
the
criminal
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
they
admitted
in
the
equity
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
takes
a
stipulation
of
the
parties
to
the
injunctive
action
in
order
to
continue
the
permanent
injunction
beyond
six
months?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
there
was
such
a
stipulation
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
your
10
days
to
appeal
the
temporary
injunction
but
that
it
will
expire
of
its
own
force
without
any
appeal
in
six
month
unless
that
was
stipulated
that
be
continued
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
six
months
time
that
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
--
doesn't
england
type
of
abstention
for
a
state
law
question
mean
retention
of
jurisdiction
but
younger
versus
harris
has
meant
dismissal,
hasn't
it?
