justice
potter
stewart
mr.
smith,
i
hesitate
to
further
complicate
but
seems
to
become
rather
a
prolix
argument
here
but
are
you
familiar
with
the
probably
not
with
the
decision
of
this
court
announced
this
morning,
gonzalez?
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
of
course
cast
a
substantial
doubt
upon
whether
or
not
this
appeal
is
properly
here
at
all
because
this
decision
by
the
three-judge
court
was
not
a
decision
on
the
constitutional
merits,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
decision
to
dismiss
because
of
its
understanding
of
a
fifth
circuit
law,
the
law
younger
against
harris?
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i'm
sure
you're
not
--
i
wouldn't
possibly
expect
you
to
be
familiar
with
the
opinion
announced
this
morning.
but
the
opinion
at
least
raises
questions
of
--
and
suggest
doubts
as
to
whether
or
not
the
case
like
yours
is
of
directly
appealable
to
this
court
whether
it
should
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
since
it
was
a
decision
--
an
action
dismissing
your
prayer
for
an
injunction
by
the
three-judge
court
on
grounds
short
of
a
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
you
raised.
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
filed
a
protective
appeal
in
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
very
open
question
as
i
suggest
it
to
you.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
a
dismissal
of
your
prayer
for
an
injunction
is
what
you
have
in
the
three-judge
district
court.
and
have
you
filed
a
protective
appeal
from
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
your
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
