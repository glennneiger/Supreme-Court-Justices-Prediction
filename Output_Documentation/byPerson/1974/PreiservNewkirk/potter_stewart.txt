justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
little
bit
backward
reasoning
is
that
what
you
--
you
said
that
if
it's
disciplinary
he
does
get
a
hearing
but
what
if
he
claims
its
disciplinary
and
you
say
well,
it
is
just
administrative
that's
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
problem
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
on
the
other
hand
or
as
the
mere
fact
that
you
denied
that
he
is
being
punished
mean
that
he
is
not
being
punished.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
institutions
are
there
--
penal
institutions
are
there
in
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
auburn
and
clinton
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
maximum?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
24
and
they
are
all
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
--
every
area
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
first
factor?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
pochoda,
in
answer
to
a
question
a
moment
ago
from
my
brother
powell.
your
answer
surprised
me
because
i
didn't
think
it
had
been
your
theory.
you
talked
about
fourteenth
amendment
interests
being
protected
well,
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
or
three
rather
basic
things
that
protects
life,
liberty
and
property
or
property
from
being
taken
away
without
due
process
of
law?
now,
life
is
not
necessarily
of
fourteenth
amendment
interest
neither
as
liberty,
neither
as
property
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
is
that
a
person
cannot
be
deprive
of
any
one
of
those
three
things
without
due
process
of
law.
i
had
understood
your
claim
to
be
that
what
was
involved
here
was
a
deprivation
of
liberty
when
a
person
an
inmate
is
transferred
for
reasons
having
to
do
with
an
evaluation
of
him
from
a
minimum
security
institution
to
a
maximum
security
institution.
but
an
answer
to
my
brother
powell,
you
indicated
that
your
theory
was
he
acquired
a
property
interest
when
he
was
transferred
to
a
minimum
or
medium
security
institution
and
that
to
take
transferring
from
there
to
a
maximum
security
institution
would
be
depriving
him
of
property,
has
that
been
your
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
then
you
made
a
mistake
in
answer
to
my
brother
powell?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
that,
isn't
it?
certainly,
it
doesn't
take
his
life
we
can
agree
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
might
be
argued
but
what
is
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
property
interest?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
if
a
sort
of
amount
by
saying
that
300
people
here
who
have
been
here
the
shortest
time
will
be
the
ones
or
the
three
people
here
or
300
people
who
have
been
here
the
longest
time
or
if
we
say
we're
going
to
take
every
tenth
just
at
random,
are
none
of
those
selections
would
you
claim
any
right
to
a
hearing,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
on
the
other
hand
they
said
the
following
300
people
are
going
to
be
the
ones
to
be
transferred
for
budgetary
reasons
or
capacity
reasons
because
we
think
those
of
the
300
after
evaluating
all
of
our
population.
those
300
who
seemed
to
have
less
the
least
potential
for
benefit
at
the
program
here
then
you'd
say
there
would
have
to
be
a
due
process
hearing,
right
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
which
he
found
that
he
had
pejoratively
found
against
him.
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
had
--
was
in
the
group
that
had
at
least
potential
for
benefit
of
that
institution
and
therefore
he
was
going
to
be
in
that
group
that
was
transferred
to
the
greater
security
institution
would
he
then,
have
a
right
to
a
due
process
hearing?
i
gather
you'd
say
you
would.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
are
the
random
selectee
suffer
the
same
loss
and
yet
you're
not
even
claiming
that
he's
entitled
to
due
process.
justice
potter
stewart
and
why?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
meant
when
he
went
to
clinton?
justice
potter
stewart
special
housing
