mr.
hillel
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
commissioner
of
corrections
of
the
state
of
new
york
from
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit
which
held
that
when
an
inmate
is
transferred
between
a
medium
security
institution
and
a
maximum
security
institution,
he
is
entitled
to
a
due
process
hearing
regardless
of
the
type
of
transfer
that
is
whether
it's
administrative
or
disciplinary
or
for
any
other
reason.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
handed
down
on
june
3,
1974
approximately
three
weeks
before
this
court's
decision
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell.
and
it
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
had
been
handed
down
in
october
of
1973.
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case
your
honor
are
not
very
much
in
dispute
at
this
point
and
essentially
what
took
place
is
that
on
june
2,
1972
at
the
wallkill
correctional
facility
which
is
a
medium
security
institution
in
new
york
state.
a
group
of
inmates
circulated
the
petition
calling
for
the
formation
of
an
inmate
labor
union.
the
circulation
of
this
petition
caused
a
certain
degree
of
tension
and
unrest
of
the
institution
because
there
was
already
in
existence
an
inmate
liaison
committee
which
had
been
elected
by
the
inmates.
and
while
the
petitions
were
being
circulated,
there
was
a
rumor
that
was
going
through
the
population
that
the
liaison
committee
had
supported
the
labor
union
whereas
in
fact
that
was
not
true.
one
of
the
members
of
the
liaison
committee
spoke
to
the
superintendent
on
the
telephone.
the
superintendent
was
at
his
residence
while
the
circulation
was
taking
place
and
the
superintendent
gave
this
committee
member
permission
to
address
the
inmates
on
the
public
address
system.
and
he
advised
--
this
inmate
advised
his
fellow
prisoners
that
the
liaison
committee
did
not
support
the
union
and
that
any
inmates
who
wish
to
discuss
the
matter
could
meet
at
a
common
meeting
place.
such
a
meeting
did
take
place,
there
were
no
fights,
there
was
no
violence
but
there
was
loud
talk
and
inmates
were
trying
to
out
shout
each
other.
and
essentially,
the
inmates
were
concerned
number
one
with
why
the
inmate
liaison
committee
was
not
supporting
the
union
and
number
two
many
of
them
were
fearful
that
because
the
union
did
not
have
official
sanction
that
perhaps
there
would
be
reprisals
directed
toward
those
who
would
sign
the
union
petition.
for
the
next
two
days
after
this
meeting
had
taken
place,
the
institution
seemed
to
be
calm
at
least
according
to
the
superintendent's
testimony.
however,
he
directed
his
deputies,
his
deputy
superintendents
to
go
into
the
population
and
ascertain
what
the
situation
was
and
it
was
reported
back
to
him
by
his
deputies
that
there
was
still
a
degree
of
tension
and
unrest
in
the
population
because
of
this
potential
power
struggle
between
the
liaison
committee
on
one
side
and
the
union
organizes
on
the
other
side.
now,
wallkill
correctional
facility
is
basically
an
open
facility.
there
are
no
large
cellblocks
as
we
have
in
a
conventional
prison.
there
were
merely
quarters
and
individual
rooms
and
there's
no
way
that
portions
of
this
institution
can
be
isolated
in
the
event
that
there's
a
disturbance.
the
superintendent
testified
that
he
was
concerned
that
at
a
movie
that
was
coming
up
on
the
following
weekend
where
all
of
the
population
would
be
in
one
room
that
there
might
be
a
disturbance
that
the
friction
might
result
in
a
fight
between
the
two
factions.
and
on
the
6th
of
june,
he
called
the
correction
department
in
albany
and
he
requested
permission
to
transfer
a
small
group
of
inmates
without
any
disciplinary
consequences
merely
to
protect
them
and
to
cool
the
situation.
and
he
was
given
that
permission
and
on
june
8,
1972,
five
out
of
eight
inmates
who
have
been
recommended
by
his
deputies
for
transfer
were
sent
to
other
correctional
facilities.
the
superintendent
himself
did
not
choose
where
they
were
sent
that
was
done
by
the
classification
board
in
albany.
about
a
month
after
these
transfers
took
place,
the
respondent
newkirk
and
his
co-plaintiffs
at
time
began
this
lawsuit
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
they
asked
the
district
judge
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
returning
them
to
wallkill
pending
the
outcome
of
the
case.
the
district
judge
denied
that
relief
but
set
the
case
down
for
an
early
trial.
the
trial
did
take
place
in
november
of
1972
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
by
that
time
two
of
the
group
that
have
been
transferred
had
already
been
paroled
and
their
cases
were
immediately
dismissed
as
moot.
the
district
judge
heard
testimony
from
the
two
remaining
inmates
and
from
the
superintendent
and
from
a
deputy
commissioner
of
corrections
and
at
the
close
of
the
trial,
the
district
judge
reserved
decision
and
as
an
effort
toward
settling
the
case.
the
superintendent
agreed
to
take
the
two
remaining
plaintiffs
back
to
wallkill
without
there
having
to
go
to
any
other
facilities.
they
were
taken
back
and
settlement
and
negotiations
began,
we
discussed
the
possibility
of
the
consent
decree
and
in
the
interim
another
of
the
plaintiffs
was
given
an
open
parole
day
and
he
was
paroled
in
february
of
1973.
at
that
point,
there
was
only
one
plaintiff
left
that
was
mr.
newkirk
and
he
had
been
at
wallkill
for
three
or
four
months
at
this
time.
he
had
been
returned
to
his
job.
the
superintendent
believed
that
there
were
no
longer
any
difficulties
and
he
affirmed
that
he
would
treat
this
man
fairly
that
there
would
be
no
retribution
for
having
brought
the
lawsuit.
and
at
that
point,
we
decided
to
seize
our
settlement
efforts
and
to
move
to
dismiss
the
case
as
moot.
we
made
our
motion
in
march
of
1973
and
the
district
judge
granted
that
motion
as
to
the
third
inmate
who
had
been
paroled
but
the
district
judge
reserved
decision
as
to
mr.
newkirk
because
he
was
still
in
custody.
and
i
might
add
that
at
time
mr.
newkirk
was
not
yet
eligible
for
parole.
his
earliest
parole
eligibility
is
in
july
of
1975.
the
district
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
october
of
1973
and
it
held
that
although
there
was
not
a
sufficiently
delineated
controversy
to
warrant
the
granting
of
an
injunction
it
nevertheless
issued
the
declaratory
judgment
and
it
held
that
the
mr.
newkirk's
rights
have
been
violated
because
he
had
not
been
informed
in
advance
of
the
rules
of
the
institution
that
would
lead
to
a
transfer.
when
the
district
court
entered
its
judgment
it
added
an
additional
requirement
that
if
mr.
newkirk
was
to
be
transferred
in
the
future
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
notice
of
charges
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
that
is
correct,
your
honor
it
was
not.
we
appeal
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
the
second
circuit
and
what
we
were
seeking
was
merely
a
clarification
that
where
a
transfer
is
done
for
purely
administrative
reasons
and
it
does
not
have
adverse
parole
consequences
where
there's
no
punishment
at
the
receiving
institution
where
it's
merely
to
separate
rival
groups
of
inmates
where
there
is
no
detriment
to
the
inmates'
record
that
these
transfers
should
not
be
within
the
parameters
of
the
due
process
clause.
and
the
second
circuit
in
our
view
went
even
further
than
the
district
judge.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
the
district
judge's
opinion
that
in
fact
this
was
a
disciplinary
transfer
because
there
were
no
segregation
units
that
wallkill
and
in
effect
the
superintendent
was
punishing
this
group.
but
the
court
of
appeals
went
further
and
said
that
regardless
of
the
type
of
transfer
regardless
of
the
labor
placed
on
the
transfer
that
every
inmate
who
experienced
the
change
in
custody
level
and
who
experienced
the
deprivation
of
privileges
that
were
alleged
in
this
case
would
be
entitled
to
a
due
process
hearing.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
his
decision
and
judgment
were
handed
down
in
october
of
1973.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
that's
correct.
your
honors,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
on
two
grounds.
number
one
as
a
matter
of
law
and
number
two
on
the
grounds
of
mootness
and
with
respect
to
our
first
ground,
we
think
that
this
court
should
declare
and
make
it
clear
that
the
lower
federal
courts
that
where
an
inmate
is
moved
between
institutions
and
he
is
not
places
in
solitary
confinement
does
not
lose
his
good
behavior
allowances,
does
not
suffer
adverse
parole
consequences
that
in
that
situation,
the
man
is
not
entitled
to
a
due
process
hearing
of
the
sort
that
he
would
receive
under
wolff
versus
mcdonnell.
in
a
footnote
in
wolff,
this
court
stated
that
the
procedures
in
that
case
were
intended
to
apply
to
solitary
confinement
of
loss
of
good
behavior
allowances
but
not
necessarily
to
other
losses
of
privileges.
now,
we
think
there
is
some
very
compelling
reasons
why
the
due
process
clause
should
not
apply
in
this
situation.
first,
many
transfers
are
made
for
security
reasons
and
we
are
required
to
act
on
confidential
information
which
it
may
very
well
be
dangerous
to
reveal
to
the
inmate.
both
superintendent
butler
and
the
deputy
commissioner
of
correction
testified
that
it's
a
matter
of
correctional
procedure
an
inmate
has
never
told
in
advance
that
he's
going
to
be
transferred
because
by
telling
him
in
advance
it
may
provoke
the
act
of
misconduct
which
the
transfer
is
designed
to
prevent.
very
often
we
received
information
from
confidential
sources
sometimes
from
other
inmates
and
if
we
were
to
reveal
why
someone
was
being
transferred
it
might
very
well
reveal
the
source,
it
might
provoke
an
act
of
violence.
and
as
we've
cited
in
our
both
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
our
brief
there
have
been
many
cases
in
the
last
two
or
three
years
where
prison
administrators
have
been
sued
for
damages
and
sometimes
personal
damages
for
failing
to
protect
inmates
from
assaults
by
other
inmates.
and
the
power
to
move
to
inmates
between
institutions
is
one
of
the
primary
ways
that
these
types
of
assaults
can
be
prevented.
these
are
situations
where
we
don't
want
to
bring
the
man
up
on
disciplinary
charges.
we
may
not
have
enough
concrete
information
to
bring
him
up
on
disciplinary
charges.
we
don't
wish
to
adverse
the
effect
his
record.
we
merely
want
to
remove
him
from
that
situation.
the
second
reason
why
we
think
that
due
process
is
inappropriate
here
is
that
these
procedures
may
well
inhibit
some
of
our
rehabilitation
programs.
in
new
york
state,
we
have
movement
now
toward
the
use
of
medium
and
minimum
security
facilities
and
these
programs
are
based
on
the
assumption
that
if
the
program
is
not
working
or
if
the
inmate
is
not
working
out
in
that
program
that
we
can
move
a
man
out
there.
and
if
we're
in
a
situation
where
when
we
move
a
group
of
men
to
a
new
facility
we
have
to
give
everyone
of
them
a
due
process
hearing
when
we
decide
for
programmatic
reasons
to
move
them
to
another
facility
or
to
change
them
and
move
them
into
a
new
program.
we
feel
that
that
would
be
a
very
undue
burden
on
the
administration
and
moreover,
they're
may
not
be
much
that
the
inmate
himself
can
contribute
at
the
hearing,
it
maybe
for
reasons
that
a
totally
unrelated
to
his
conduct.
thirdly,
we
think
that
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
that
may
be
true
your
honor.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes
but
i
think
many
inmates
faced
with
the
transfer
to
a
facility
that
they
might
not
wish
to
go
to
would
probably
request
the
hearing
if
they
could
get
one.
we
also
think
that
this
court
should
reject
the
concept
which
is
inherent
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
the
district
court
decision
that
because
an
inmate
is
sent
to
an
institution
which
has
programs
that
he
feels
will
benefit
him
or
which
is
geographically
convenient
for
him
that
if
he
is
removed
from
that
institution
he
must
be
given
a
hearing.
and
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
quite
extensively
in
their
brief
and
we
agree
with
them
that
merely
because
a
man
has
been
sent
to
a
particular
facility
does
not
mean
that
he
should
have
a
legal
right
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
to
remain
there.
we
ran
a
unitary
correction
system.
we
have
24
institutions
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
our
entire
program
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
we
can
move
man
freely
between
our
facilities
without
having
to
give
them
hearings
every
time
we
change
the
custody
level.
we
also
think
that
this
is
one
area
where
the
need
for
some
re-adjudication
outweighs
the
individual
inmate's
interest
in
due
process.
first,
as
i
mentioned
before
we
don't
believe
that
notice
of
charges
and
advance
warning
is
appropriate
in
many
of
these
cases
as
i
said
it
would
provoke
the
very
act
that
we're
trying
to
prevent.
secondly,
where
the
transfer
is
being
made
for
diagnostic
reasons
it
may
not
be
helpful
to
the
inmate
to
tell
him
that
he
is
being
transferred
because
he
has
a
personality
disorder
or
because
he
is
intellectually
incapable
of
functioning
in
a
particular
program.
and
we
don't
think
they're
giving
him
a
hearing
in
this
type
of
situation
will
benefit
him
or
that
he
will
be
able
to
add
anything
that
will
aid
the
decision
makers
in
making
their
decision.
thirdly,
we
think
that
due
process
procedures
are
certainly
not
helpful
where
inmates
are
being
moved
because
of
budgetary
reason
or
because
a
particular
facility
is
being
faced
out
or
converted
into
a
different
type
of
facility.
and
if
i
may
give
an
example
here
in
the
fall
of
1973
we
converted
the
sing
sing
correctional
facility
from
essentially
a
long-term
institution
to
a
short-term
institution.
and
in
the
process
we
have
to
move
750
inmates
to
maximum
security
facilities
because
that
was
the
only
place
we
can
send
them.
now,
under
the
rational
of
the
decisions
below,
i
suppose
that
we
would
be
required
to
give
all
of
them
due
process
hearings
because
we
changed
their
custody
levels
and
because
they
may
not
enjoy
some
of
the
privileges
of
the
new
institutions
that
they
enjoyed
at
sing
sing
and
because
many
of
them
may
be
further
from
their
homes.
but
i
think
if
we
had
to
give
750
hearings
in
that
situation
it
would've
been
truly
intolerable
burden.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
in
new
york,
we
try
to
avoid
them.
the
departments
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
technically
speaking
there
could
be
such
a
thing
because
our
disciplinary
rules
do
provide
for
a
program
change
as
one
of
the
consequences
of
act
of
misconduct.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
if
we
had
one
of
those,
i
believe
that
the
inmates'
remedy
would
be
to
complain
to
the
superintendent
and
complain
to
the
corrections
commissioner
that
he
should've
been
given
hearing
under
our
rules.
but
the
department's
policy
is
against
disciplinary
transfers.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
we
keep
records
on
the
movement
of
inmates
and
usually
the
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
normally,
the
transfer
order
itself
will
merely
state
administrative
reasons
separation
from
enemies
it's
usually
a
one
line
statement
and
these
are
very
common
and
as
in
this
case
they
don't
have
disciplinary
consequences.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
they're
not
available
to
the
inmate
but
they
could
be
available
in
a
court
proceeding
if
the
court
directed
that
they
be
produced
as
a
matter
of
discovery.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
because
we
don't
believe
that
there's
no
punishment
intended
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
loss
is
sufficiently
grievous.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
i
think
there
would
be
in
new
york.
there
would
be
a
disciplinary
transfer
if
a
man
was
brought
up
on
charges
for
having
violated
the
rules
and
the
disposition
at
the
hearing
was
that
his
program
be
changed
and
that
he
be
moved
to
another
facility.
as
a
result
of
that
specific
rule
violation
and
it
would
be
entered
in
his
record.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
it's
disciplinary
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
response
to
a
violation
of
the
rules
and
it
would
be
entered
in
this
record
and
there
would
be
a
packet
of
papers
in
his
record
which
would
indicate
that
he
was
brought
up
on
charges.
so
that
it
would
indicate
both
to
the
receiving
institution
and
the
parole
board
then
in
fact
he
had
been
brought
up
on
charges
for
this
offense.
now,
in
the
ordinary
situation
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
if
he's
brought
up
on
charges
if
he
has
committed
a
rule
violation
or
policy
is
that
he
should
get
a
hearing
under
our
disciplinary
rules.
the
department
does
not
favor
disciplinary
transfers.
they
want
the
inmates
to
be
brought
up
on
charges.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
it
is
a
problem
but
we
feel
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
it
is
a
problem
but
we
feel
that
this
is
an
area
where
the
balance
should
be
struck
in
favor
of
the
state
rather
than
the
inmate.
an
inmate
when
he
brings
a
lawsuit
will
always
claim
that
he's
being
punished
for
some
reason.
he
may
not
be
punished
at
all
but
that's
one
of
the
ways
that
he
can
get
into
federal
court
under
section
1983.
he
has
to
claim
a
deprivation
of
due
process
or
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
so,
i
think
the
mere
fact
to
the
man
claims
that
he's
being
punished
does
not
necessarily
dispositive.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
that's
correct.
but
we
feel
that
in
this
area
where
there's
no
loss
of
good
behavior
allowance
where
he's
not
sent
to
segregation
where
there's
no
effect
on
his
parole
eligibility
that
the
balance
should
be
struck
in
our
favor
rather
than
in
favor
of
the
inmate.
we
also
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
it
was
a
telephone
call
followed
by
formal
paperwork
that
went
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes
it
was
deemed
an
emergency.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
it
was
deemed
an
emergency
situation
but
the
department
in
albany
determined
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
the
warden
did,
yes.
but
the
department
in
albany
determined
where
the
men
went.
so,
the
warden
did
not
have
the
power
to
select
some
far
away
institution.
they
might
have
been
moved
to
another
institution
that
was
very
close.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
we
have
a
total
of
24
and
we
have
5
maximum
security
prisons.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
auburn
and
clinton,
attica,
green
haven
and
great
meadow
are
the
maximum
security.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
all
of
that
state.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
those
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
those.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
oh!
yes,
the
new
york
city
has
its
own
correctional
system
and
the
counties
have
their
county
penitentiaries
for
misdemeanors.
we
take
only
the
felony
prisoners.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
short
term
institutions.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
certainly,
he
could've
been
sent
there
by
the
classification
or
the
reception.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
that's
correct
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
we're
afraid
of
that
ones
you
established
the
principle
that
if
a
man's
custody
level
is
changed
or
if
it
is
an
institution
that
farther
from
the
place
of
the
conviction
then
we
feel
that
inmates
who
were
coming
in
the
classification
process
will
also
request
the
same
due
process
hearing.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
as
an
alternative
grounds
we
raise
them
to
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
the
issue
of
mootness.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
having
loss
on
this
issue
twice
in
the
lower
courts
i
felt
that
we
had
to
brief
the
merits
as
well
as
the
mootness
question
but
i
think
this
is
clearly
an
example
of
the
moot
case.
this
man
was
returned
to
the
institution.
it
was
entirely
speculative
whether
he
would
be
transferred
again.
it
was
not
a
class
action
and
we
think
that
the
district
judge
could've
dismissed
the
case.
so
now,
the
man
has
been
moved
to
a
minimum
security
facility
in
new
york
city
which
indicates
tangentially
that
it's
quit
positive
that
he'll
probably
be
released
on
parole
when
he
reaches
his
eligibility
date
in
july.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
it
is
capable
of
repetition,
yes
if
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
not
necessarily
but
i
think
one
has
the
way
the
likelihood
that
the
conduct
occur
again
in
our
view
we
felt
it
was
not
very
likely
that
mr.
newkirk
was
going
to
be
transferred
in
the
near
future.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
yes
and
the
district
judge
felt
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
grant
an
injunction.
he
only
granted
declaratory
judgment.
if
i
may
save
my
remaining
time.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
few
points
that
were
made.
first,
at
the
trial
i
asked
mr.
newkirk
on
cross-examination
if
he
was
ever
placed
in
special
housing
and
this
appears
at
page
37
(a)
of
the
appendix.
mr.
newkirk
testified
that
he
was
not
placed
in
special
housing
and
that
he
did
not
receive
any
loss
of
good
behavior
allowances.
secondly,
the
concern
that
we
had
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
when
at
the
receiving,
yes,
at
that
the
receiving
institution.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
would
be
the
segregation
unit.
he
was
placed
in
an
idle
company
until
they
found
a
job
for
him
which
meant
that
he
was
kept
in
his
own
cell
and
that
he
was
released
for
one
hour
in
a
day
for
a
recreation
but
he
was
not
put
into
the
segregation
unit
at
clinton.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
there
may
be
other
inmates
who
were
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
because
he's
in
with
the
rest
of
the
prison
population
and
there
may
be
other
incoming
inmates
on
that
gallery.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
each
inmate
is
in
his
own
cell
and
when
he
was
on
a
reception
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
it
depends,
i
think
in
this
case
the
testimony
it
was
there
for
approximately
a
month.
it
depends
on
how
long
the
institution
takes
the
classifying
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
in
solitary
confinement,
he's
completely
removed
from
the
population
and
there
maybe
no
one
else
in
the
solitary
confinement.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
because
there's
a
great
deal
of
activity
on
these
galleries
and
there
were
people
would
pass
by
the
cell.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
but
he's
not
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
a
new
york
state
inmate
is
always
in
the
cell
by
himself.
we
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
not
23
hours
a
day
but
inmates
are
always
confined
in
single
cells
in
new
york
when
he's
in
the
reception
status
there
are
other
inmates
on
the
gallery
and
there
were
officers
and
guards
and
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
at
wallkill
they
didn't
have
cells.
they
have
rooms.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
it
was
different.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes,
but
he
was
treated
in
the
same
way
that
any
incoming
inmate
would've
been
treated
the
same.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
they
don't.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
they
have
a
hospital
unit
where
an
emergency
they
can
put
someone
for
a
day
or
two
but
they
don't
have
a
solitary
confinement.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
in
many
situations.
on
occasion,
they
will
use
the
hospital
rooms
if
an
inmate
is
violent
or
in
order
to
calm
someone
down
but
if
the
inmate
is
a
troublemaker
or
if
he's
a
real
threat
of
violence
they
must
move
him
to
another
institution.
the
language
in
the
second
circuit
that
we're
concerned
about
appears
at
pages
26
and
27
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
there
the
court
speaks
about
the
substantial
loss
that
was
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
transfer.
and
the
second
circuit
makes
it
clear
that
even
though
this
transfer
may
have
been
outside
of
the
disciplinary
process
that
it's
the
substantial
loss
suffered
by
the
inmate
that
requires
the
due
process
procedures.
and
we
think
that
this
rule
could
apply
to
any
type
of
classification
case
where
a
man
is
sent
from
medium
to
maximum
or
minimum
to
medium
for
whatever
reason.
now,
in
a
system
of
24
institutions
and
15,000
inmates
we
cannot
possibly
avoid
errors
in
every
case
but
we
think
that
the
likelihood
that
an
error
may
be
committed
in
an
individual
case
is
not
so
great
that
these
procedures
should
be
invoked
and
perhaps
thousands
of
transfers
per
year.
we
also
think
that
the
hames
case
is
an
example
of
the
next
logical
step
in
this
process
where
the
second
circuit
rule
that
if
there
was
a
punitive
motive
even
if
a
man
went
between
maximum
security
institution
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
and
there
again,
they
stressed
the
distances
involved
and
the
possible
lawsuit
privileges
that
the
man
may
have
suffered
as
a
result
of
going
between
these
two
institutions.
now,
in
point
of
fact
there
were
no
two
institutions
in
new
york
that
are
exactly
alike
and
the
man
may
be
move
from
green
haven
to
clinton
or
from
auburn
to
attica
or
for
purely
programmatic
reasons
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
conduct
and
he
may
lose
the
job
that
he
enjoyed,
he
may
lose
an
educational
program
that
he
enjoyed,
he
maybe
farther
from
his
family
but
we
don't
think
that
all
of
these
hearing
--
all
of
these
transfers
required
due
process
hearings.
and
under
the
rational
of
the
second
circuit
where
due
process
is
measured
only
by
the
loss
experience
by
the
inmate
and
i
think
legally
we
would
be
required
to
give
hearings
in
this
situation.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
they
don't
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
of
appeals
struck
out
that
requirement
in
the
district
court's
order
because
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
specify
all
of
these
situations
that
might
lead
to
a
transfer.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
prison
rules.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
there
was
none.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
we
have
departmental
regulations
which
list
we
have
adjustment
committee
hearings
and
we
have
formal
disciplinary
hearings
and
they
listed
these
positions
that
an
inmate
can
receive
as
a
result
of
those
hearings.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
the
rules
do
provide
for
a
program
change
that
could
be
interpreted
as
a
transfer
but
the
department's
policy
is
not
to
use
transfers
as
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
that
is
correct.
yes,
they
do
not.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
well,
we
did
--
mr.
hillel
hoffman
we
did
say
that
but
the
court
of
appeals
very
flatly
rejected
that
assertion.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
i
said
it
was
conceivable
that
if
you
interpret
a
program
change
is
a
transfer
to
another
institution,
there
could
be
one
but
in
that
case,
the
man
would
have
to
be
given
formal
notice
of
charges.
but
in
practice,
no,
we
don't
have
disciplinary
transfers
and
in
that
respect,
we
differ
for
i
believe
from
the
federal
system.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
yes.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
no,
he
is
--
unless,
it's
a
special
case
for
example
a
juvenile
offend
or
where
he
might
go
to
reformatory
but
other
than
that
he's
merely
remanded
to
the
department
of
corrections.
mr.
hillel
hoffman
that
is
correct.
the
judgment
is
made
to
the
classification
and
intake
center,
and
even
in
that
process
a
man
may
go
back
and
forth
between
institutions.
for
example
a
man
may
be
received
at
green
haven
and
be
sent
to
sing
sing
for
a
month
for
classification
and
then
go
back
to
green
haven
or
go
to
clinton,
or
go
to
attica
and
all
of
these
institutions
do
have
some
differences
and
that's
what
we're
concerned
about
here,
that
if
the
measure
of
due
process
is
the
loss
of
privileges
or
the
distance
from
the
place
of
conviction,
then
the
possibilities
of
hearings
are
endless
in
these
cases.
thank
you.
