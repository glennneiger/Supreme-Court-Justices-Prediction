justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hoffman,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
this
was
not
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
in
the
words
of
the
many
opinions
capable
of
repetition
as
to
this
particular
respondent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
said
a
moment
ago
loss
of
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
connection
with
the
transfer
from
wallkill
to
clinton,
what
are
those
interests?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
more
closely
confined
in
clinton.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
interest
or
i'm
thinking
of
the
subsequent
second
circuit
case
which
apparently
held
that
even
in
a
transfer
from
institutions
of
comparable
security
there
was
a
hearing
required.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
claim
then
if
someone
is
transferred
from
wallkill
to
a
comparable
place
near
buffalo
he
suffered
a
grievous
loss
because
he's
closer
to
buffalo
than
he
is
to
new
york?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
know
that's
the
major
loss
but
do
you
claim
that
there's
any
protected
interest
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
you're
transferred
400
miles
away?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
wallkill
becomes
overcrowded
and
clinton
is
under
used
so
that
there's
an
administrative
matter
some
people
have
got
to
be
chosen
to
go
from
wallkill
to
clinton?
now,
do
you
say
that
everybody
who
is
involved
in
that
kind
of
a
transfer
is
entitled
to
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
in
my
hypothesis
certainly
the
man
is
subjected
to
sort
of
constraints
that
you
say
amount
to
a
restriction
on
his
liberty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
transfer
from
wallkill
to
clinton
because
of
overcrowding
that
i
asked
you
about
earlier
would
i
would
think
deprive
him
of
that
property
interest
if
he
has
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
why
couldn't
the
inmates
say,
“look,
if
you
got
to
transfer
300
people
out
of
the
thousand
there
at
wallkill
it
shouldn't
be
me
because
i
done
so
well
here.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
justice
white's
question
was
about
the
prison
rule
it's
not
about
the
district
court
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hoffman,
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
in
new
york
when
a
judge
sentenced
a
convicted
person
does
he
designate
the
prison
to
which
he
shall
be
sent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
department
of
corrections
makes
a
judgment
as
to
where
he
should
be
confined?
