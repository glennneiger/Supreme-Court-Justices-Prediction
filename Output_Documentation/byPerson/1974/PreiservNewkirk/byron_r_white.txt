justice

r.

is
there
such
a
thing
as
the
disciplinary
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
such
a
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
you
have
one
of
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
inmate
commits
some
punishable
act
at
which
he
stayed
in
the
same
prison
he
might
suffer
some
loss
of
privileges
or
he
might
be
put
in
solitary
confinement
or
he
might
lose
good
times
something
like
that.
if
he
commits
one
of
those
acts,
he
decide
well,
“we
got
to
reassess
this
man.
he
really
needs
to
be
some
place
else.”
if
he
just
did
that
and
has
transferred
him
to
another
type
of
institution
because
he
didn't
think
he
belong
to
this
one.
you
wouldn't
call
that
a
disciplinary
transfer
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
say
there's
ever
a
disciplinary
transfer
even
if
the
commission
of
some
punishable
act
is
the
thing
that
should
use
the
transfer?
when
will
there
ever
be
a
disciplinary
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes,
but
why
is
that
a
disciplinary
transfer
that's
just
an
administrative
decision
he
belong
somewhere
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
take
it
that
in
any
--
that
there
will
never
be
a
due
process
problem
arise
in
the
disciplinary
transfer
because
he
will
have
had
his
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
take
it
there
are
an
additional
up
in
municipal
and
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless,
there
are
in
new
york
state
in
addition
of
the
states
that
you
mentioned.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hoffman,
could
he
had
been
sent
to
clinton
on
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
been
sent
there
we
wouldn't
have
a
lawsuit
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
got
a
process
about
an
issue
that
may
not
need
at
all
that
in
his
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
it
was
primary?
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
you
never
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
define
minimal?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
notice
and
opportunity
to
respond
to
allow
the
personal
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
personal
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
confrontation?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
be
here
had
that
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
not
complaining
about
a
classification
initially?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
place
there
a
right
close
from
that
even
though
it
might
have
been
erroneous
assignment
administratively?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
want
--
do
you
think
that
inmates
are
entitled
to
participate
in
all
reclassification
decisions
as
long
as
the
decision
may
increase
the
severity
of
confinement
whether
there
disciplinary
or
not
if
they
just
decide
--
well
this
man
hasn't
getting
along
quite
as
well
here?
you
should
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
think
he
would
progress
better
in
another
type
of
institution.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
he
have
been
transferred
from
sing
sing
to
clinton
and
he
had
felt
that
sing
sing
was
more
congenial
and
he
really
didn't
want
to
go
to
clinton,
would
that
entitle
him
to
a
due
process
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
do
required
vested
interest
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
then
you
answered
correctly
even
under
your
theory
to
mr.
justice
powell
and
i
was
mistaken
about
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
transfer
just
to
look
down
to
persons?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pochoda,
have
you
ever
been
at
–
well
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
ever
been
at
the
federal
institution
at
springfield,
missouri?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
and
i
suppose
this
is
characteristics
of
some
state
institutions.
they
have
varying
types
of
confinement,
they
have
maximum
security,
they
have
minimal
security,
really
minimal
and
they
have
some
intermediate
stuff.
now,
if
this
respondent
were
transferred
next
week
from
one
level
to
another,
would
you
be
here,
within
the
same
institution
but
into
a
different
type?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
speaking
of
the
whole
something
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
lets
suppose
a
prisoner
violates
the
prison
rules
several
times
and
then
each
occasion
he's
disciplined,
he's
given
a
hearing
and
he's
some
kind
of
discipline
is
imposed,
he's
loss
good
time
or
he
spent
some
days
in
solitary
or
something.
the
policy
is
periodically
the
review
of
man
situation
and
here
they
look
back
on
a
man's
record,
they
say,
“well,
he's
after
hearing
he's
been
found
to
have
these
six
infractions.
we
think
he
belong
somewhere
else.”
now,
it
isn't
they
are
transferring
because
of
his
conduct
but
it's
for
conduct
that's
already
been
adjudicated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
he
contribute,
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
such
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
really
--
you
aren't
really
urging
your
entitlement
to
a
hearing
in
order
to
participate
in
the
judgment
of
the
administrator
as
to
where
he
belongs?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
make
sure
he's
operating
on
accurate
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
state
--
i
know
we
have
to
do
it
briefly
your
position
on
mootness.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
mr.
newkirk
in
any
other
is
he
in
any
different
position
in
this
respect
from
other
prisoners?
justice
byron
r.
white
threatened
in
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
prison
rules
or
do
the
prison
rules
expressly
say
that
for
certain
kinds
of
conduct
a
transfer
is
inappropriate
sanction?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
or
was
there
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
didn't
have
prison
rules
as
to
defining
what
kind
of
sanctions
would
be
imposed
for
certain
kinds
of
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
that
suggest
that
transfer
is
not
a
type
of
punishment
under
the
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
told
me
that
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
again,
the
rules
purport
to
say
if
you
would
engage
in
certain
of
kind
of
conduct
here's
what
might
happen
to
you
and
the
rules
don't
say
that
a
transfer
is
imposed
for
engaging
in
those
kinds
of
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
once,
i
am
still
surprise
you
don't
just
say
that
there
isn't
any
such
thing
as
disciplinary
transfer
prisons
in
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
about
these
transfers
they
just
are
not
for
discipline.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
while
ago
said,
“yes,
there
are
disciplinary
transfers.”
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
trying
to
get
away
from
them
but
you
said
there
are
some.
