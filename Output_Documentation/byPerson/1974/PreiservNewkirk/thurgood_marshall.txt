and
maybe
they
might
not
want
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'd
only
give
the
hearing
if
they
asked
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
way
to
find
out
whether
you
do
have
them
or
not?
do
you
keep
any
records?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
records
on
why
they're
moved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
available?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
all
it
took
was
a
telephone
call?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean
the
decision
was
made
is
just
a
result
to
telephone
call
i
won't
get
these
guys
out
of
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
he
was
too
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
determines
it
was
an
emergency?
the
warden
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
say
he
isn't
in
the
cell
all
by
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
segregation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
all
the
other
inmates
in
separate
cell?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
long
is
he
there
for
a
day?
23
hours
a
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
it
in
the
solitary
take
confinement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
he
completely
removed
for
23
hours
a
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
say
he's
in
the
cell
by
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
by
himself,
he
is
in
isolation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
23
hours
a
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
were
they
in
separate
cells
in
wallkill?
certainly,
they
were
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right
i
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
was
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
one
month
at
least
it
was
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
have
solitary
in
wallkill?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
isolation
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
you
do
something
at
wallkill
that
deserves
isolation,
the
only
way
to
do
it,
is
transfer
him
to
clinton,
is
that
right?
