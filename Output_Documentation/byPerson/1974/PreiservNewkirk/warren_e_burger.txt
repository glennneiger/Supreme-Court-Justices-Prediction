chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
74-107,
preiser
against
newkirk.
mr.
hoffman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
date
of
the
district
judge's
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
had
--
he
didn't
have
benefit
of
course
of
wolff
against
mcdonnell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
are
short
term?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
injunction
entered
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
the
declaratory
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pochoda.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
hoffman
that
he
could've
been
assigned
at
clinton
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
alter
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical
case
just
to
trifle
perhaps
not
to
trifle.
a
decision
is
made
administratively
by
the
director
of
the
institutions
for
the
state
that
500
prisoners
from
one
category
or
let
us
say
medium
security
must
be
transferred
to
other
facilities,
and
the
only
other
ones
available
are
maximum
security
and
the
warden
in
each
institution
has
then
directed
to
determine
which
of
the
prisoners
in
his
institution
are
marginally
more
dangerous,
more
in
need
of
maximum
security
than
others.
now,
he's
got
to
make
a
value
of
judgment
to
effect
that
transfer
in
order
to
relieve
the
overcrowding,
a
due
process
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
selection
for
transfer
involves
a
value
judgment
that
prisoners
a,
b,
and
c
are
going
to
be
moved
but
d,
e,
and
f
are
not
going
to
moved.
now,
is
that
a
different
kind
of
a
value
of
judgment
by
the
warden
than
the
one
that
was
made
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
may
i
sort
out
your
answer
and
read
it
in
light
of
the
way
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals
this
means
that
potentially
every
one
of
these
500
transferees
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
now
you
suggest
that
the
solicitor
general
and
your
friend
misread
these
opinions.
i
read
them
the
same
way
they
do
and
toppled
with
your
answer
it
would
call
for
a
hearing
and
every
one
of
these
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
if
he
wanted
a
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
seems
to
me
when
you
answered
mr.
justice
white
you
added
another
factor
the
complaint
being
critical.
you
said
if
the
institution
has
a
rule
that
six
violations
leads
to
transfer
then
they
could
do
it
without
an
additional
hearing.
mr.
justice
white
didn't
begin
with
the
premise
that
there
was
an
institutional
rule
but
that
the
warden
and
the
process
of
evaluating
all
prisoners
who
had
had
problems
said
here's
the
man
with
six
violations
we
think
he's
got
to
go
somewhere
else.
now,
there's
no
rule
this
is
just
a
value
in
judgment
that
six
is
enough
for
this
man
and
it
might
take
into
account
the
nature
of
the
crime
which
he
committed
in
the
first
place,
the
length
of
the
sentence
which
he
had
long
or
short.
what
do
you
say
about
that
must
there
be
a
hearing
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
he
is
refraining
from
certain
conduct
which
he
might
otherwise
do
because
of
this
risks
on
his
experience?
what
kind
of
conduct
do
you
have
in
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
i
can
say
that
you're
speculating
on
what
he
is
doing
about
in
terms
of
his
behavior?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
little
puzzle
by
one
of
your
responses.
you
suggested
i
think
in
answer
from
mr.
justice
stewart
that
if
they
decided
that
the
last
300
prisoners
in
would
be
the
ones
transferred.
or
the
first
300
in
just
an
arbitrary
classification
but
that
would
be
all
right.
now,
is
there
any
rational
basis
for
that
or
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
that
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
hoffman,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
