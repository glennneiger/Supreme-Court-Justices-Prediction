mr.
daniel
pochoda
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
transfer
of
respondent
james
newkirk
in
june
of
1972
is
characterized
by
two
things.
in
the
first
place,
he
was
a
moved
from
a
medium
security
institution
wallkill
to
clinton
the
maximum
security
institution.
and
therefore,
respondent
contends
it
constitute
a
grievous
loss
under
constitutional
standards
to
mr.
newkirk.
secondly,
the
transfer
itself
was
based
on
conclusions
made
by
prison
officials
about
mr.
newkirk's
behavior
about
his
conduct
at
wallkill.
respondent's
position
is
that
in
light
of
these
two
factors
he
was
entitled
to
at
lease
minimal
procedure
of
due
process
prior
to
his
removal
from
wallkill.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
the
first
factor
is
the
change
from
a
medium
to
a
maximum
security
institution
thereby
resulting
in
a
major
change
and
a
loss
of
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
second
factor
was
that
the
transfer
was
based
on
evaluations
of
conduct.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
in
matter
of
procedure,
your
honor?
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
though
we
have
not
appealed
from
the
second
circuit
is
granting
a
minimal
due
process
which
in
this
case
was
only
notice
of
the
pending
allegations
against
from
mr.
newkirk
and
an
opportunity
to
respond.
the
second
circuit
did
not
feel
that
that
it
should
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
set
for
all
time
the
type
and
the
amount
of
procedures
that
were
necessary
in
transfer
situations.
the
second
circuit
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
no,
with
the
personal
hearing.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes.
well,
no
the
second
circuit
did
not
answer
that
question.
it
was
the
second
circuit
opinion
was
a
few
weeks
before
this
court's
decision
in
wolff.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
the
most
direct
deprivation
suffered
by
mr.
newkirk
was
a
loss
of
his
liberty
interest.
we
feel
that
as
the
courts
below
found
that
in
analysis
of
the
differences
of
the
two
institutions
reveal
quite
clearly
that
a
move
from
the
medium
security
and
sent
to
the
maximum
security
institution
resulted
in
restrictions
in
every
area
of
mr.
newkirk's
liberties
and
freedoms.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes,
in
fact,
the
object
i
mean
the
object
of
wallkill
itself
is
defined
by
new
york
state
is
to
provide
relief
fund
the
regimentation
and
restrictions
found
in
maximum
security
institutions.
new
york
state
has
set
off
as
mr.
hoffman
stated
the
system
of
intentional
gradation
between
institutions.
and
this
is
codified
by
regulation
and
new
york
state
by
that
and
by
the
way
it
runs
wallkill
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
need
to
provide
a
different
atmosphere
to
prepare
people
for
release.
there's
a
need
to
instill
individual
responsibility
into
the
inmate
to
have
actions
governed
by
that
internalize
control
and
not
just
by
the
physical
bodily
restraints.
and
every
witness
at
trial
including
prison
officials
attested
to
the
substantial
differences
in
terms
of
individual's
freedoms
and
liberties
for
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes,
that
case
of
hames
versus
montana
which
is
presently
pending
before
this
court
was
cert.
i
just
would
like
to
state,
we
don't
feel
that
it
is
all
equivalent
to
this
case
and
only
gets
mentioned
because
both
of
briefs
of
the
petitioners
in
united
states
characterized
that
we
think
in
erroneous
manner.
in
fact,
the
court
there
was
not
concerned
and
did
not
state
that
the
important
issue
was
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
grievous
loss
when
in
fact
the
court
directed
the
second
circuit
which
was
just
remanded
on
a
dismissal
of
a
complaint
direct
to
the
trial
court
to
decide
whether
the
transfer
was
in
fact
a
punitive
transfer
was
in
fact
the
disciplinary
transfer.
that
case
concerns
the
situation
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
stewart
where
the
inmate
involved
claims
that
the
transfer
was
in
fact
for
violation
of
a
rule.
and
the
second
circuit
mentioned
that
it
seemed
to
them
that
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
made
and
that
the
transfer
might
well
have
been
just
to
get
around
the
rules
of
the
institution
--
the
disciplinary
regulations
that
required
a
hearing.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
no
we
feel
that
the
major
loss
here
is
due
to
the
differences
in
the
institutions.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
it's
hard
to
make
that
judgment
without
having
the
record
before
us
and
might
in
fact
that
a
result
of
that
transfer
there
are
certain
interest
that
would
be
affected.
there
may
be
freedoms
that
are
denied
by
that
transfer
in
any
specific
case.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
then
maybe
that
the
transfer
--
well,
you're
saying
only
because
of
the
distance
involved
and
no
difference
in
the
institutions?
mr.
daniel
pochoda
i
would
say
probably
no.
probably
it
would
not
be
in
and
of
itself
for
violation
or
an
infringement
of
fourteenth
amendment
interest.
and
that
the
operative
fact
in
this
case,
in
this
situation
was
the
distinct
differences
as
attested
to
by
all
of
the
witness
including
the
prison
officials
the
distinct
differences
between
the
two
institutions
that
every
aspect
of
the
inmate's
life
was
more
restrictive
and
more
repressive
in
terms
of
physical
restraints,
bodily
restraints,
freedom
of
choice,
freedom
of
movement.
i
should
also
add
that
once
--
when
--
upon
arrival
at
clinton,
respondent
was
placed
in
segregation
for
a
lengthy
period.
for
four
and
a
half
weeks,
he
was
denied
every
opportunity,
every
freedom
of
movement
and
it
was
kept
locked
in
his
cell
for
23
hours
a
day.
and
the
district
court
stated
as
specifically
that
it
was
placed
in
segregation
upon
arrival
at
clinton.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
mr.
newkirk
was
originally
assigned
to
maximum
security
institution.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
we
would
not
be
here
if
he
had
remained
at
the
maximum
security
institution
throughout
his
incarceration.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
no.
in
fact,
we
admit
that
there
is
no
absolute
right
to
be
place
at
wallkill.
we
agree
with
the
state
in
new
york
and
with
united
states
and
this
amicus
brief
that
there
is
no
right
to
be
placed
at
wallkill
that
the
state
in
fact
did
not
have
to
set
up
wallkill
just
as
the
state
did
not
set
up
a
parole
system
and
doesn't
have
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes
we
feel
it's
analogous
for
example
to
place
a
man
on
parole
that
even
if
the
person
is
erroneously
granted
parole
and
even
though
the
state
does
not
have
to
setup
a
parole
system,
once
placed
in
that
institution
assuming
this
court
finds
that
there
is
an
interest
that
there
is
a
loss
of
fourteenth
amendment
interest
in
terms
of
a
change
from
that
type
of
institution
to
a
maximum
security
institution.
there
is
a
right
to
be
granted
procedural
due
process
before
removal.
we're
also
not
contesting
as
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
your
honor
--
excuse
me.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes,
the
problem
is
with
the
use
of
the
words
“disciplinary
and
administrative”
i
mean
most
of
the
trial
courts
when
confronting
this
question
when
confronted
with
the
similar
situation
have
stated
that
a
transfer
is
in
fact
disciplinary
when
it
involves
a
closer
custody,
when
it
involves
this
type
of
change,
when
it
involves
punishment
in
fact
because
it
is
clear
that
the
difference
in
life
at
clinton
as
oppose
to
wallkill
involves
a
severe
deprivation
and
punishment
to
the
inmate.
and
the
courts
have
recognized
that
almost
the
definition
of
disciplinary
is
when
you
imposed
punishment
in
response
to
an
inmate's
behavior
or
in
response
to
conclusions
about
an
inmate.
and
we
are
saying
when
those
two
instances
are
present
since
there's
no
way
for
this
court
to
draw
a
line
between
what
is
“disciplinary”
unless
you
look
to
the
objective
conditions.
now,
when
in
fact
the
change
resulted
in
loss
of
an
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
when
that
change
has
comes
about
because
of
conclusions
about
conduct.
again,
we
say
that
the
inmate
should
not
be
involved
and
this
characterization
by
the
petitioners
and
the
united
states
is
not
accurate.
and
i
should
say
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
in
a
while
that
many
of
the
characterizations
of
the
scope
and
effect
of
the
holdings
below
are
not
accurate
and
it
does
not
cover
the
ground
that
is
characterized
or
put
forth
here
today.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
no,
your
honor.
the
court
below
specifically
this
is
one
of
the
examples
i
was
referring
to
specifically
did
not
say
--
said
that
in
that
case,
this
particular
holding
does
not
enforce
that
is
only
when
the
transfer
is
due
to
conclusions
about
the
inmate,
about
the
inmate
itself.
so,
that
the
inmate
can
have
some
valuable
input
given
the
situation
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
that's
right
your
honor
and
we
say
that
even
when
that
loss
is
present
in
terms
of
a
procedural
due
process
right
it
would
not
exist
because
it
would
be
meaningless
that
the
court
specifically
stated
both
of
the
lower
courts
stated
that
unless
that
the
transfer
is
based
on
some
evaluation
about
the
individual
himself.
so,
that
the
individual
could
contribute
something
of
value
to
a
due
process
hearing;
the
case
is
not
applicable.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
decision
involves
conclusions
about
individuals.
we
think
that
there
would
be
minimal
due
process
required.
of
course
the
inmate
--
there
are
many
other
considerations
that
may
enter
into
decision
and
the
warden
is
free
to
use
his
discretion,
to
use
his
expertise
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
case
of
morrissey
versus
brewer
to
use
whatever
other
facts
that
are
around
that
are
important
to
that
decision,
certainly.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
are
also
are
individual
effects
where
the
inmate
can
have
input.
we
contend
and
the
courts
below
held
that
should
be
at
least
minimal
procedures.
let
me
just
state
that
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
it
was
a
manslaughter
offense.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
i
think
20
until
life.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
in
1962,
yes.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
no,
it
wouldn't
your
honor.
not
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
think
we
should
make
it
very
clear
because
i
think
that
both
the
petitioners
and
the
united
states
have
completely
misrepresented
the
scope
and
effect
of
the
holding
below
that
the
holding
below
specifically
limited
its
constitutional
ruling
as
it
properly
did
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
that
facts
of
this
case
involved
a
transfer
from
one
type
of
institution
to
another
of
greater
security
and
it's
specifically
declined
the
court
of
appeals;
it's
on
page
27
of
the
petition
for
cert
specifically
declined
to
extend
this
ruling
to
other
factual
situations.
it
stated
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
and
we
feel
that
we
cannot
decide
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
question.
the
court
did
not
decide
for
example
what
would
be
required
in
the
situation
from
one
maximum
transfer
or
transfer
from
one
maximum
security
institution
to
another
maximum
security
institution.
and
it
should
have
not
--
it
should
not
and
that
should
await
further
adjudication,
further
records
and
should
not
be
done
on
the
basis
of
a
hypothetical
plaintiff.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes
--
well,
it
would
depend.
we
don't
say
--
we
wouldn't
use
the
word
“more
favorable”
we
would
use
that
if
in
fact
the
differences
involved
in
terms
of
the
initially
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
i
see
in
terms
of
the
gradation
setup
by
the
state
of
new
york
itself.
yes,
we
feel
that
upon
a
factual
analysis
of
the
difference
between
those
institutions
the
court
properly
found
that
there
were
fourteenth
amendment
interests
that
would
be
infringe
upon
a
move
from
a
lesser
security
to
a
higher
security.
and
only
in
that
case,
is
an
inmate
entitled
to
a
minimal
due
process
hearing.
now,
again,
we
must
reiterate,
we
are
not
contending
that
a
person
cannot
be
removed.
we
are
also
not
even
contending
that
that
persons
cannot
be
removed
immediately.
and
the
court
below
specifically
held
that
an
emergency
situations
people
can
be
immediately
removed
even
prior
to
a
hearing
and
the
hearing
can
be
granted
at
a
subsequent
time.
we
are
not
in
any
way
taking
or
attempting
to
take
away
the
power
of
the
prison
officials
to
remove
anybody
or
any
government
group
of
inmates
from
any
one
institution.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
there's
an
interest
are
all
sides
--
the
state
as
well
as
the
individual
that
that
discretion
be
informed
discretion
that
everybody
has
an
interest
in
avoiding
errors.
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
the
record
demonstrates
conclusively
that
a
person
was
erroneously
transferred
and
the
state
itself
as
stated
by
mr.
hoffman
and
it
appears
throughout
their
brief.
they
are
concerned
about
assaults.
they're
concerned
about
one
inmate
attacking
another
inmate.
they
have
no
interest
in
removing
the
wrong
inmate
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
fact,
mr.
newkirk
himself
the
court
of
appeals
found
his
transfer
was
based
on
misinformation.
it
was
based
on
third
hand
reports;
the
lack
of
procedures;
the
lack
of
accurate
factfinding
led
to
mistakes.
there
could
be
no
interest
on
any
side
in
such
procedures.
there
also
is
no
interest
as
this
court
recognized
in
morrissey
to
have
inmates
respond
in
this
way
to
arbitrary
action.
it
can
only
hurt
chances
for
rehabilitation.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
no,
your
honor.
we
view
it
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
i
didn't
realize
at
hand
indicating
that.
we
believe
that
it
is
a
direct
infringement
on
the
liberty
interest
that
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
we
feel
that
that
it
might
well
be
argued
that
mr.
newkirk
had
in
fact
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
we
would
also
argue
that
there
was
a
property
interest
involved.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
that
he
had
by
meeting
the
criteria
for
placement
at
wallkill
and
successfully
being
placed
at
wallkill
because
of
maintaining
a
good
record
a
maximum
security
institutions.
he
had
become
available
himself
of
the
benefit
provided
by
wallkill.
those
benefits
included
training
in
a
marketable
vocation.
he
was
only
able
to
train
in
his
intended
profession
at
wallkill.
so
that
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
i
see,
we
believe
that
both
interests
were
an
inmate
would
be
deprive
to
both
interest
by
a
move
from
wallkill
to
maximum
security
institution
that
the
liberty
interest
is
more
direct
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
differences
between
wallkill
and
clinton
but
that
it
also
acquired
a
state
created
benefit
that
he
had
reasonable
expectation
of
maintaining
that
benefit
until
he's
released
from
prison
because
that
is
the
usual
procedures
that
wallkill
that
prison
stayed
there
until
release
and
very
few
people
are
transferred
back.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
your
honor,
we
believe
that
in
fact
the
transfer
because
of
overcrowding
would
deprive
him
of
a
liberty
and
the
property
interest
but
that
the
due
process
would
procedural
due
process
would
not
be
applicable
to
any
situation
where
the
deprivation
was
based
on
conclusions
that
had
nothing
to
do
about
the
inmate
that
it
would
be
meaningless.
it
would
be
meaningless
to
offer
a
hearing
in
such
situations.
certainly,
one
could
be
offered
but
we
feel
that
it
would
be
a
meaningless
gesture
to
have
an
inmate
come
in
and
to
try
to
offer
some
evidence
that
the
budget
really
isn't.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
but
i
believe
that
the
inmate
might
well
but
that
would
be
sustentative
for
equal
protection
argument
and
this
case
we
are
concerned
only
the
procedural
due
process
in
this
case
and
the
court
below
was
only
concerned
and
of
course
the
record
in
the
briefs
is
only
concerned
procedural
due
process.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
your
honor,
we're
not
trying
to
take
that
judgment
away
from
the
warden.
we're
saying
the
warden
can
make
those
judgments
but
if
the
judgment
as
a
part
of
the
process
a
part
of
the
input
to
that
judgment
involves
facts
about
the
inmate.
the
inmate
should
participate.
the
inmate
cannot
participate
and
say,
“i'm
better
than
b
or
c.”
but
if
the
warden
who
may
be
misinformed
about
the
inmate
as
he
was
in
this
case
to
that
extent
to
the
extent
that
facts
about
the
individual
go
into
that
decision
he
should
be
provided
due
process
hearing
just
as
to
the
extent
that
facts
about
an
individual
go
into
the
decision
to
deprive
a
person
of
parole
as
this
court
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
if
there
was
a
need
to
transfer
500
prisoners?
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
we
would
and
we
feel
that
it
would
necessarily
that
if
was
only
on
budgetary
that
there
might
be
as
i
responded
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
a
separate
question
about
a
rational
plan,
a
separate
question
of
substantive
due
process
question
or
an
equal
protection
concern
but
that
unless
there
was
some
finding
about
the
individual
that
was
involved.
there
would
not
be
a
procedural
due
process.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes
--
no,
the
inmate
i
don't
believe
would
be
able
to
judge
himself
or
compare
himself
to
the
other
399
other
people
but
to
the
extent
that
it
is
based
on
some
evaluation
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
if
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
why
it
is
necessary.
by
the
standards
put
forth
by
the
state
of
new
york
and
united
states,
mr.
newkirk
would
not
have
been
--
is
not
entitled
as
they
say
to
a
due
process
hearing.
he's
not
entitled
even
though
he
suffers
the
same
loss
as
a
person
who
gets
a
disciplinary
hearing
and
even
though
it's
also
based
on
evaluation
about
his
conduct.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
they
propose
on
its
face
is
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
for
there
is
--
there
is
no
rational
reason
why
a
person
who
acts
wrongfully,
who
acts
in
violation
of
institutional
rules
before
being
removed
and
suffer
a
loss
is
allowed
and
permitted
due
process
and
person
who
acts
totally
properly
and
legally
who
suffers
the
same
loss
on
the
basis
of
his
conduct
does
not
get
a
due
process
hearing.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
that's
because
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
because
procedural
due
process
would
not
be
relevant.
there
would
be
a
meaningless
gesture.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
again,
we
think
that
might
well
be
a
violation
of
substantive
due
process
or
an
invidious
discrimination
based
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
i
haven't.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes,
i
believe
that
might
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
i
can't
say
with
certainty
your
honor
but
i
believe
that
that
might
well
be
the
type
of
change
that
would
affect
liberty
interest.
i
think
this
court
and
every
court
that
i
know
that
has
considered
the
question
has
stated
that
a
transfer
even
within
any
one
particular
institution
which
in
fact
deprives
a
person
of
liberty
interest
such
as
segregation
or
solitary
confinement.
courts
have
consistently
stated
that
that
transfer
must
be
accompanied
by
procedural
due
process
regardless
of
the
label
put
on
that
transfer
by
prison
administrators.
courts
have
recognized
on
every
level
all
of
the
trial
courts
have
considered
this
question
including
the
appellant
courts
and
the
appellate
courts
have
stated
time
and
again
that
we
must
have
an
objective
tests
that
it
defeats
the
purpose
and
it
would
make
the
due
process
clause
a
melody
if
prison
officials
are
allowed
to
say,
“well,
we
are
going
to
have
this.
this
have
been
made
is
going
to
be
force
to
suffer
the
same
loss
as
the
person
who
has
disciplined
but
we're
going
to
call
it
administrative.”
therefore,
he
is
not
entitled
to
procedure
due
process.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes,
we
would
think
that.
in
fact,
he
would
be
entitle
to
procedural
due
process
but
requirements
have
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
requirements
have
been
met
in
that
case
that
the
only
transfer
only
concerns
conduct
that
already
has
been
after
a
due
process
hearing
been
found
to
in
fact
occurred
and
that
it
wouldn't
have
to
if
it
focus
the
institution
has
a
rule
for
example
that
six
violations
will
lead
to
transfer.
and
after
a
hearing,
the
inmate
is
found
on
six
different
occasions
to
violate
the
institutional
rule
he
wouldn't
have
a
separate
seventh
hearing
because
there
would
again
be
meaningless
that
in
fact
there,
our
test
is
met.
but
on
every
occasion
where
conduct
was
involved
and
that
conduct
in
any
way
led
to
the
decision
to
transfer
the
person
was
provided
with
procedural
due
process.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
no,
we
are
not
attempting
to
take
that
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
exactly.
we
feel
that
it's
exactly
analogous
to
the
situation
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
that
as
this
court
recognized
there
was
a
factual
part
of
the
decision
and
there's
also
a
predictive
part.
i
mean
even
if
a
person
is
found
for
example
to
a
violated
technical
one
of
the
technical
rules
of
parole,
it
doesn't
automatically
mean
he's
going
to
be
recommitted.
the
hearing
is
to
decide
what
the
facts
are
and
what
the
attitude
of
the
inmate
is?
what
mitigations
serve
necessary?
but
of
course
the
final
decision
is
still
left
the
prison
administrators
as
it
properly
should
and
the
same
exact
situation
exists
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
no,
i
just
used
that
as
hypothetical
in
terms
of
the
rule
but
again
if
all
of
the
factors
of
that
concerned
the
conduct
that
the
inmate
are
already
--
have
already
been
the
subject
of
procedural
due
process
hearing
another
one
is
not
necessary.
and
the
court
although
there
may
be
again
a
substantive
due
process
problem
if
for
example
other
people
with
six
violations
are
not
transferred
that
is
not
the
subject
to
this
suit.
we
think
and
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
yes,
we
feel
that
in
fact
what
has
occurred
in
this
case
is
at
best
a
temporary
voluntary
secession
that
in
fact
it's
a
weaker
case
then
others
where
the
court
has
ruled
that
a
voluntary
secession
is
not
enough
because
petition
has
maintained
their
policy
of
this
type
of
transfer.
and
in
fact,
mr.
newkirk
is
immediately
and
presently
subject
to
that
policy.
there
have
been
no
intervening
events
such
as
the
end
of
a
strike
or
events
at
vietnam
or
events
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
other
cases
that
make
recurrence
unlikely.
it
is
totally
within
the
control
of
petitioners
to
write
the
second
transfer
mr.
newkirk
immediately
and
for
the
same
reasons
it
didn't
in
the
first
place.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
we
believe
he
is
because
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
we
believe
he
is
into
the
extent
that
he
has
already
experienced
this
conduct.
and
therefore
he
is
presently
suffering
continuing
harm.
he
is
not
acting,
he
is
refraining
from
some
certain
actions
that
he
would
have
--
would
participate
in
had
he
not
been
transferred
in
light
of
this
initial
transfer
under
continuing
policy.
and
secondly,
the
initial
transfer
is
on
mr.
newkirk's
record.
of
course
also
the
fact
that
the
initial
transfer
has
meant
that
we
have
a
completed
record
in
this
case
and
that
all
of
the
facts
have
been
fully
laid
out
for
the
court.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
the
same
type
of
conduct
that
led
to
his
initial
transfer
which
his
perfectly
legal
and
proper
conduct
in
terms
of
and
being
above
and
petitions
which
the
petitioners
themselves
state
are
legal
and
it's
only
because
of
reactions
of
others
that
they
decided
to
transfer
five
people
in
this
case.
so,
it's
refraining
from
legal
conduct
but
of
course
the
petitioner's
transfer
policy
allows
them
to
move
out
persons
who
were
involved
in
legal
conduct
to
impose
this
punishment
on
the
basis
of
legal
conduct
without
giving
reasons.
so,
it's
in
the
exact
same
position
as
he
was
and
as
minutes
before
his
transfer
in
june
8th
of
1972,
nothing
has
changed.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
well,
except
that
the
policy
depend
--
does
not
depend
on
mr.
newkirk
given
their
transfer
policy
of
the
people
can
be
transferred
for
any
reason
without
any
justifications
offered.
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
behavior,
he
can
be
transferred
tomorrow
no
matter
what
he
does
there's
nothing
that
it's
preventing
the
operation
of
this
policy
on
mr.
newkirk;
does
not
depend
on
what
mr.
newkirk
does.
no,
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
court
below
found
that
in
spite
of
mr.
newkirk's
actions
that
he
had
done
nothing
that
he
had
perfectly
--
that
he
had
adjusted
well
to
wallkill
and
was
participating
fully
and
never
been
any
problem,
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
made
a
mistake
about
what
they
claimed
required
the
transfer.
he
was
still
transferred
and
of
course
this
can
happen
today
and
tomorrow
as
well.
mr.
daniel
pochoda
in
the
first
place,
i
meant
to
say
that
it
would
be
all
right
in
terms
of
--
there
would
not
be
a
necessity
for
procedural
due
process.
i
should
also
add
by
the
way
that
in
light
of
the
over
extension
as
characterized
by
the
petitioners
this
particular
holding
does
not
concern
great
numbers
of
inmates
and
does
not
concern
hundreds
of
people
that
only
18
people
one
person
per
month
was
transferred
from
wallkill
involuntarily
to
a
maximum
security
institution.
we're
not
talking
about
great
numbers
and
we
should
wait.
will
you
agree
that
this
court
should
await
and
not
make
a
decision
about
other
types
of
hypotheticals
about
transfers
between
institutions
or
initial
placement
until
those
facts
before
the
court?
but
we
feel
that
that
there
would
be
leeway
in
deciding
in
a
situation
like
that
that
is
a
rational
that
is
a
reasonable
plan
in
terms
of
penological
and
administrative
considerations
that
the
first
300
or
even
the
last
300
should
be
removed
if
necessary.
that
has
never
been
necessary
in
new
york
state
but
that
would
not
bring
into
play
procedural
due
process
needs.
