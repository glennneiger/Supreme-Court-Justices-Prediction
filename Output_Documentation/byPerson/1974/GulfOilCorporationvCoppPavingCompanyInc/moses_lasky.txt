and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
interstate
commerce
in
three
sections
of
the
clayton
act.
section
2
which
is
the
robinson-patman
act,
section
3
which
is
the
provision
prohibiting
certain
tie-in
arrangements
and
section
7
which
is
commonly
called
the
celler-kefauver
act
or
amendment
which
has
to
do
with
mergers
and
acquisitions.
the
case
does
not
involve
any
question
at
all
of
what
congress’
has
powers
are.
it
involves
no
question
what
congress
can
do.
it
only
involves
the
question
of
what
in
fact
it
has
seen
fit
to
do
by
the
legislation
it
has
enacted.
now
the
starting
point,
i
assume
of
any
consideration
of
what
an
act
of
congress
means
is
the
language
of
the
act
of
congress.
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
the
three
acts
that
i
speak
of
are
much
the
same
and
are
to
be
contrasted
with
the
provision
of
the
sherman
act
because
they
are
much
narrower.
now,
each
one
of
these
three
acts,
each
one
requires
that
the
proscribed
conduct
have
an
effect
and
an
impact
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
now,
i'll
use
the
word
“commerce”
hereafter
for
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
the
language
of
the
three
is
identical.
it
is
required
that
the
“effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
attempt
to
create
a
monopoly
in
the
line
of
commerce”
and
in
this
respect
these
three
are
identical
with
the
sherman
act.
they
require
an
effect
or
impact
on
interstate
commerce,
but
the
sherman
act
requires
no
more.
under
the
sherman
act
it
makes
no
difference
who
commits
the
conduct
or
where
it
occurs
if
it
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
but
here
under
these
three
clayton
act
sections,
much
more
is
required.
effect
or
impact
which
is
expressly
spelled
out
and
required
is
only
one
of
several
of
the
tests
of
jurisdiction
mandated
by
these
acts.
robinson-patman
requires,
in
addition
to
the
effect
or
impact,
that
the
discriminatory
sale
would
be
and
i
quote
“by
a
person
engaged
in
commerce,
in
the
course
of
such
commerce”
and
again
a
discrimination
requires
at
least
two
sales
to
have
a
discrimination
between
it
requires
“either
or
any
of
the
purchasers
involved
must
be
in
commerce,”
that’s
in
addition
to
the
effect
or
impact
clause.
section
3
has
almost
the
identical
language.
it
requires
that
the
tie-in
conduct
be
that
of
a
“person
engaged
in
commerce
in
the
course
of
such
commerce.”
in
section
7,
the
anti-acquisition
section,
requires
not
only
that
the
effect
be
adverse
on
a
line
of
commerce,
but
that
the
acquiring
corporation
be
“a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce”
and
in
addition,
that
the
acquired
corporation
be
a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce.
now,
before
we
go
further
to
discuss
the
effect
of
the
act
besides
from
this
case,
it's
necessary
to
find
out
what
product
we’re
talking
about
because
that's
the
key
to
this
case.
the
product
involved
in
this
case
is
a
substance
known
as
asphaltic
concrete,
not
asphalt.
and
i
emphasize
it
is
not
liquid
asphalt
because
liquid
asphalt
moves
in
interstate
commerce
and
while
this
case
started
is
one
of
what
later
became
a
consolidated
as
the
western
liquid
asphalt
cases,
the
trial
court
carved
out
the
asphaltic
concrete
aspects
of
it
and
left
the
liquid
asphalt
aspect
still
going,
they're
still
in
the
court,
they're
still
proceeding
with
the
rest
of
the
western
liquid
asphalt
cases.
asphaltic
concrete,
let
me
say
when
the
court
carved
it
out,
the
court
said
at
the
beginning
there
seem
to
be
a
jurisdictional
element
upon
asphaltic
concrete.
it
directed
the
plaintiff
to
take
all
the
discovery
he
needed
on
the
jurisdictional
elements,
come
back
and
make
a
showing
and
when
that
occurred,
the
court
ruled
out
the
asphaltic
concrete
elements.
asphaltic
concrete
is
a
product
made
in
california
and
which
by
its
very
nature
cannot
be
sold
across
the
state
line.
it's
a
bulky
product,
composed
of
95%
of
rocks,
sand
and
gravel
which
is
mined
in
the
local
pits
and
the
other
5%
is
liquid
asphalt,
also
produced
in
california
from
california
refineries.
this
material
is
used
as
a
topping,
black
top,
streets,
roadways,
driveways.
in
order
to
make
it,
you
mix
the
rock
with
hot
asphalt
in
a
hot
plant
and
the
product
has
to
be
laid
down
before
it
cools.
consequently,
it
has
to
be
laid
down
within
35
miles
from
the
plant
where
it's
made.
that
means
it
can't
move
in
interstate
commerce.
the
hot
plants
of
all
the
parties
in
this
case
are
located
in
california.
the
hot
plants
of
the
plaintiff
were
all
located
in
the
los
angeles
basin.
the
hot
plants
of
the
acquired
corporation
involved
in
the
section
7
aspect
of
this
case,
sully-miller
are
all
located
in
the
los
angeles
basin,
that
is
to
say
los
angeles
county
and
the
suburbs
around
it.
none
of
the
asphaltic
concrete
made
or
sold
involved
in
this
case
ever
got
within
200
miles
of
an
interstate
border
of
california.
now,
the
robinson-patman
in
section
3
accounts
concerns
sales
of
asphaltic
concrete
by
the
petitioner,
industrial
asphalt.
it
is
accused
of
having
discriminated
and
yet
none
of
its
asphaltic
concrete
sales
ever
got
within
200
miles
from
the
california
border.
none
of
never
crossed
the
state
line,
none
of
never
could
cross
a
state
line.
now,
the
section
7
count
involves
the
acquisition
by
union
oil
company
which
is
not
in
the
asphaltic
concrete
business
of
one
sully-miller.
sully-miller
has
its
plants
solely
in
los
angeles
county
and
the
neighborhood
of
orange
county
and
makes
asphaltic
concrete
from
local
materials,
sells
it
within
a
35
mile
range
from
los
angeles.
it
also
engages
as
a
paving
contractor
and
the
complaint,
the
amended
complaint
in
this
case
alleged
that
sully-miller's
business
was
engaged
--
being
engaged
primarily
in
the
business
of
operating
asphaltic
concrete,
hot
plants
and
contracting
street
improvements.
it's
a
street
paver
and
all
--
this
appears
at
the
appendix
of
page
15.
it
is
plants
from
the
los
angeles
basin.
it's
a
contractor
in
paving
streets
in
that
particular
area,
all
200
miles
or
thereabouts
from
the
border.
now
upon
this
state
of
undisputed
fact,
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
sections
2,
3
and
7
were
absent.
it
said
that
the
robinson-patman
act
did
not
apply
because
no
sale
by
industrial
of
asphaltic
concrete
was
in
commerce.
no
sale
was
made
in
the
course
of
commerce.
for
the
same
reason
they
held
that
the
section
3,
the
tie-in
section
did
not
apply
and
it
held
that
section
7
did
not
apply
to
union's
acquisition
of
sully-miller
for
the
simple
reason
that
sully-miller
was
not
a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce.
i
may
add
that
the
district
court
also
found
there
wasn't
any
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
it
had
given
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
every
opportunity
show
their
jurisdictional
facts.
this
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
an
interlocutory
appeal,
allowed
under
1292-b
and
that
court
reversed.
now,
until
the
decision
in
this
case,
it
had
been
the
uniformed
decision
of
a
mass
of
cases,
the
robinson-patman
does
not
apply
unless
at
least
one
of
the
sales,
involving
a
discrimination
crosses
a
state
line.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
this
state
line
test
and
it
did
it
because
it
said
asphaltic
concrete
is
used
on
streets
and
roads.
streets
and
roads
of
all
hook
up
and
eventually
something
crosses
the
state
line,
so
you
have
an
interstate
highway
system.
therefore,
the
roads
and
the
streets
are
linked
up
to
“an
instrumentality
of
commerce”
and
therefore
said
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
seller
and
the
sale
are
engaged
in
commerce.
as
for
sully-miller,
it
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
was
engaged
in
commerce
because
it
sold
asphaltic
concrete
for
use
on
roads
and
because
it
paved
streets,
as
i
say
all
200
miles
from
an
interstate
border.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
the
finding
of
no
effect
on
the
interstate
commerce
because
it
said
that
because
an
interstate
instrumentality
of
commerce
was
involved
a
road,
everybody
was
engaged
in
commerce
and
if
you're
engaged
in
commerce
the
effect
for
all
those
as
a
matter
of
law,
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
that.
this
court,
we
petitioned
for
cert
--
on
the
certiorari
upon
the
sherman
act
issue
and
certiorari
was
not
allowed
on
that
so
that's
not
before
us.
the
proposition
we
advance
now
is
that
the
judgment
and
decision
was
wrong
because
no
sales
were
made
in
commerce
by
anybody
engaged
in
commerce
and
nobody
engaged
in
commerce
was
acquired.
now,
just
this
year
on
may
24th,
the
fifth
circuit
in
scranton
construction
versus
litton
industries
reported
in
494
f2d
778
referred
to
the
decision
below
the
very
one
i'm
here
on
now,
it
referred
to
it
as
a
“new
deliverance”
and
refused
to
follow
it.
now,
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
this
new
rule
of
law
and
yet
now
that
we're
here,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
barely
defended.
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
the
other
day
in
which
he
urges
that
sections
3
and
7
should
be
read
as
if
they
were
coextensive
with
the
sherman
act.
in
other
words,
you
delete
all
of
the
language
above
sales
in
commerce,
but
in
the
course
of
commerce
by
a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
and
treat
the
acts
as
if
they
required
no
more
than
the
sherman
act
and
curiously
enough
he
says
nothing
about
the
robinson-patman
act,
he
just
talks
about
section
3
and
section
7.
we
know
of
course
that
the
department
of
justice
in
the
antitrust
division
had
never
been
lovers
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
apparently
they
don't
seem
to
defend
the
decision,
but
the
language
of
those
sections
were
all
the
same
and
whatever
decision
is
made
about
3
or
7,
would
of
necessity
have
apply
the
robinson-patman
section
2.
the
principal
argument
made
in
respondent’s
brief
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
solicitor's
general,
namely
that
with
respect
to
all
of
these
acts,
robinson-patman
2
and
7,
they
should
be
read
as
expansively
as
the
sherman
act
and
that
nothing
is
required
other
than
effect
on
commerce.
now,
if
i
maybe
forgiven
to
characterize
them,
i
would
say
that
these
two
lines
of
argument
are,
1,
would
work
surgery
by
excising
the
specific
provisions
of
robinson-patman
sections
3
and
7
and
the
other,
that
of
the
court
below
is
applying
lsd
to
the
language
and
get
--
arriving
at
a
rather
strange
interpretation.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
reason
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
great
chief
justice
treanor
of
california
once
wrote
about
the
use
of
magic
words
as
if
the
use
of
a
certain
phraseology,
somehow
decided
the
case
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
that’s
what
the
ninth
circuit
did.
it
picks
up
the
words,
interstate
highway
which
has
an
inflated
sound
divorced
from
reality,
but
tax
--
a
compulsive
significance
to
that
and
then
also
we'll
look
for
analogy
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
is
an
act
of
quite
different
language,
purpose
and
background.
the
court
below
talks
about
interstate
highways
and
if
the
court
please,
that
is
not
a
legal
term.
it
is
a
loose
terminology
for
roads,
for
whose
construction
the
federal
government
under
grant
made
statute,
the
federal
highway
aid
act
contributes
money.
it
does
so
for
forest
roads,
trails,
farm
to
market
roads,
local
rural
roads,
streets,
parkways,
county
roads,
and
also
state
roads
selected
to
connect
the
principal
centers.
respondent
called
on
the
petitioners
to
admit
by
request
for
admission
and
we
did
admit
that
98.5%
of
these
funds
received
by
the
state
of
california
went
to
county
roads.
we've
already
observed
that
sully-miller
was
a
street
paver
in
the
suburbs
of
los
angeles.
all
roads
for
which
federal
aid
is
given
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state,
local
governments.
federal
act,
the
aid
highway
act
does
not
presume
to
regulate
highways
or
operations
of
those
working
on
them
or
supplying
materials
for
them.
it
does
do
more
than
attached
conditions
with
a
gift
and
none
of
those
conditions
have
anything
to
do
with
the
problems
of
this
case.
and
so
i
respectfully
submit
that
what
the
decision
of
the
court
below
comes
to
is
to
advance
this
proposition,
“since
every
street
in
every
city
and
every
road
anywhere
in
united
states
unless
it
connects
with
other
is
part
of
an
interstate
network
of
highways.
therefore,
the
seller
of
anything
used
in
a
street
or
a
road
is
in
commerce
and
by
that
reasoning
the
local
society
for
the
care
over
the
blind
that
sells
brooms
made
by
the
blind
for
use
to
sweeping
the
streets
or
the
streets
cleaner,
or
the
tow
truck
operator
who
removes
illegally
parked
cars
on
the
streets,
all
are
engaged
in
commerce.”
now,
this
court
over
and
over
again
in
its
interstate
commerce
decisions
has
said
that
the
conception
--
the
concept
of
commerce
is
guided
by
the
most
practical
considerations.
commerce
is
an
intensely
practical
concept
drawn
from
the
normal
and
accepted
course
of
business,
these
are
statements
the
court
has
made.
now,
if
this
case
concerned
workers
constructing
a
lock
across
the
canal
or
a
draw
bridge
across
the
mississippi,
one
might
see
such
an
immediacy
to
their
operation
of
an
interstate
facility
that
you
might
come
to
the
conclusion
there
practically
that
the
construction
of
that
bridge
was
an
interstate
commerce,
but
i
submit
that
from
any
practical
reality,
selling
asphaltic
concrete
to
put
on
a
street
or
a
road,
200
miles
from
the
border
simply
is
a
horse
of
another
color
and
so
of
paving
a
city
street.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
get
back
to
our
fundamental.
our
system
of
government
is
federalism,
certainly
where
a
federal
statute
plainly
applies.
it
has
to
be
applied,
but
when
to
apply
it
is
going
to
intrude
upon
local
policies
and
to
apply
it
requires
some
procrustean
treatment,
some
stretching
then
we've
been
taught
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
hand
is
stayed.
now,
the
philosophy
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
a
highly
debatable
one.
this
court
has
frequently
commented
how
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
philosophy
of
the
sherman
act.
california
is
considered
that
robinson-patman
and
has
deliberately
refused
to
adapt
the
robinson-patman
type
statute.
california's
supreme
court
reviewing
the
matter
has
said
no.
california
has
no
robinson-patman
type
of
statute
and
has
noted
this
conflict
of
policy
and
yet
what
has
happened
here
is
that
a
federal
act
has
been
extended
in
the
california
area
to
something
local
on
misconception
that
asphaltic
concrete
is
put
upon
a
road.
now
if
the
court
please,
california
also
has
not
adapted
any
general
anti-acquisition
statute.
the
proposed
uniform
state
antitrust
law
has
deliberately
left
out
a
section
7
type
of
provision
on
the
idea
that
acquisitions
at
a
local
level
have
a
different
impact
and
deal
with
different
kind
of
policies
and
on
a
national
level.
so
we
say
again,
the
question
here
is
not
how
far
congress
could
go.
i
think
congress
could
go
to
full
length
here
if
it
wished
to.
how
far
has
it
gone
and
in
deciding
that
question,
respect
has
to
be
paid
first
to
the
language
congress
has
used
and
secondly,
to
the
federal
structure
of
the
union.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
company
--
both
of
them.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
the
requirement
of
section
7
is
your
honor
notes
is
that
the
companies,
the
acquirer
and
the
acquiring
each
must
be
engaged.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
doubt
it.
but
the
evidence
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
except
the
sully-miller
is
not.
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
the
plaintiff
was
called
on
to
produce
all
his
evidence,
complete
discovery
as
to
what
sully-miller
did
and
sully-miller
is
simply
a
local
paving
contractor
and
manufacturer
of
this
stuff
for
local
stuff.
mr.
moses
lasky
no
evidence
whatever
on
that
aspect.
the
respondent
produced
no
evidence
whatever
on
it
but
the
only
business
it's
in
--
mr.
moses
lasky
there
is
a
--
one
could
take
a
guess
of
course
that
it
buys
its
machinery
and
one
might
guess
that
the
machinery
may
have
originated
originally
out
of
the
state,
probably
came
into
rest
in
the
state,
but
there's
no
evidence
on
the
record
on
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
may
or
may
not
be,
it
depends
--
perhaps
on
how
they
bought
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh!
i
--
again,
the
record
is
silent
on
it
but
i
would
have
to
take
a
guess
that
they
do.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
would
guess
they
do.
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon?
mr.
moses
lasky
i
don't
know.
there
are
large
assembly
plants
in
california
of
all
kinds
on
machinery.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
evidence,
that
is
right.
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
again,
i
repeat
the
court
called
upon
the
respondent
to
take
all
the
discovery
and
produce
all
the
evidence
that
they'd
wished
to
bring
to
bear
on
the
subject
and
they
said
nothing
about
this.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
wouldn't
think
that
put
them
on
commerce
either.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
sir.
i
suppose
if
there
was
a
constant
flow
of
trucks
here
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
and
--
very
well,
they
may
be
buying
them
locally
from
local
distributors.
again,
while
it's
in
the
record
we
all
know
that
this
kind
of
machinery
is
sold
by
local
distributors.
mr.
moses
lasky
we
would
be
talking
about
different
things.
we
would
be
talking
about
different
things,
but
i
can
only
talk
about
the
things
in
the
record
and
i
can
only
reply
to
the
arguments
my
opponents
have
presented.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
it's
silent.
the
record
is
silent
on
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
that's
right.
mr.
moses
lasky
that's
right,
exactly
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
based
upon
that
one
fact
that
a
road
is
an
instrumentality
of
commerce.
the
asphaltic
concrete
went
into
the
road
therefore
it
was
as
a
matter
of
law
engaged
in
commerce.
that's
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
not
strongly
defended
as
i
say.
it's
being
defended
--
even
the
judgment
is
being
defended
on
the
notion
that
these
--
you
just
ignore
the
provisions
of
these
laws
and
say
that
congress
intended
to
exercise
its
commerce
power
to
the
utmost
using
exactly
the
language
which
has
often
been
used
about
the
sherman
act.
now
may
i
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
when
we
said
35
miles
everybody
has
been
talking
generously,
the
evidence
that
talks
about
5
to
50.
i
think
if
we
had
a
case
in
delaware,
a
hot
plant
operator
in
delaware,
you
might
have
a
different
problem
because
the
hot
plant
might
very
well
be
crossing
the
border,
but
you
get
--
that
border
around
southern
california
surrounds
largely
desert
area.
but
again
one
can
conceive
where
a
hot
plant
operator
might
be
of
the
crossing
state
lines.
here,
it
did
not.
mr.
moses
lasky
he
might
very
well.
that
would
be
a
different
case.
then
we'd
have
at
least
one
sale
crossing
a
state
line
then
we'd
have
the
counterpart
of
sully-miller
engaged
in
paving
all
around
here,
you'd
have
interstate
commerce?
that's
a
different
case
and
the
decision
we
asked
the
court
to
render
here
is
not
going
to
be
the
last
decision.
it’s
going
to
be
asked
to
rendering
in
questions
like
this.
now,
the
second
advice
from
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
is
that
it
appeals
to
the
analogy
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
that
act
provides
for
minimum
wages
not
only
to
employees
engaged
in
commerce,
but
also
to
employees
“engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.”
and
this
court
by
a
divided
decision
held
that
the
last
words
even
meant
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
those
engaged
in
commerce
based
upon
the
particular
legislative
history
of
that
act.
amendments
to
that
act,
divided
definitions
whereby
if
some
employees
who
are
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce,
all
employees
of
the
same
employer
are
deemed
brought
under
the
act
and
congress
could
do
that
sort
of
thing
on
robinson-patman
in
section
3
and
unquestionably
on
section
7
if
it
wished
to
do
so,
but
it
hasn't
done
so.
now,
if
the
court
please,
and
this
brings
me
to
the
solicitor
general's
line
of
argument
which
i
think
i
can
answer
very
quickly.
whenever
congress
has
got
on
legislate,
conflicting
views
of
politics,
economics,
sociology
are
pressed
upon
congress,
each
one
contending
for
an
option
and
in
the
end
congress
draws
a
line
and
makes
compromises.
now,
one
can
grant
that
legislation
is
to
be
given
a
scope
commensurate
with
congress’
purposes
and
aims,
but
congress
is
the
only
judge
not
only
of
its
goals
but
of
the
means
it
wishes
to
advance
them
and
of
the
compromises
it
wishes
to
make
among
the
contending
factors.
and
the
only
way
congress
has
to
express
the
solution
and
the
compromises
that
it's
forced
to
make
is
in
words.
now,
here
the
words
are
absolutely
clear,
not
to
be
ignored.
and
talking
about
the
sherman
act,
this
court
for
example
in
the
southeastern
underwriters
case
said
the
words
of
the
sherman
act
were
all
comprehensive.
any
person
who
restrains
trade
falls
under
the
ban
of
that
act.
here,
we
have
an
english
language
of
body
of
terms
each
of
separate
meaning,
each
having
an
--
with
an
ascending
order
of
reach.
we
have
in
commerce.
we
have
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
we
have
production
of
a
working
on
instrumentalities
of
commerce.
we
have
the
words
affecting
commerce
and
each
one
reaches
out
a
little
further
and
the
affecting
commerce
reaches
out
to
the
farthest
extent
of
the
law.
these
words
compromise
an
armory
from
which
congress
can
draw
when
it
wishes
to
express
of
its
particular
purpose
and
if
the
court
is
to
treat
all
these
words
as
synonymous
as
you're
being
asked
to
do
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
respectfully
submit
that
corrupts
the
language,
corrupts
the
law
and
it
impoverishes
congress
because
it
takes
away
from
congress
words
it
can
use.
and
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
words
selected
so
carefully
by
the
legislative
branch
such
as
engaged
in
commerce,
engaged
in
the
course
of
commerce
don't
mean
anymore
than
affecting
commerce
then
congress
is
going
to
be
hard
put
to
express
itself
when
it
doesn't
wish
to
exercise
the
commerce
power
to
its
fullest
extent.
it
will
be
driven
to
circumlocution,
negatives
and
provisos.
now
everybody
knows
the
legislative
history
of
the
robinson-patman
act
demonstrates,
that
robinson-patman
was
the
product
of
a
complex
series
of
legislative
proposals
ending
up
in
compromises
that
have
given
many
courts
headaches
in
trying
to
resolve
the
meaning.
i
was
quoting
at
that
point
from
the
meyer
paving
case
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari,
recently
in
414
us.
mr.
moses
lasky
robinson-patman?
robinson-patman
was
of
1936
amendment
to
section
2
of
clayton
which
was
1940.
mr.
moses
lasky
approx
--
yes,
1936.
enacted
incidentally
after
this
court
in
the
bendheim
brothers
case
or
the
darby
case
and
the
cases
involving
labor
relations
act
had
explicated
the
far
reach
of
power
that
congress
possessed.
no
doubt
as
to
that
this
court
by
the
time
congress
enacted
this
act
had
told
congress
that
it
had
the
most
extensive
power,
nevertheless,
there
was
no
extension
or
change
in
these
words.
similarly,
in
celler-kefauver
in
1951
--
50,
they
didn't
change
the
words
that
they
used
in
1914
despite
the
fact
that
they
could
have
and
gone
much
further.
i
submit
the
case
with
this
submission.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
still
sits
and
if
it
is
of
view,
the
department
of
justice
or
others,
these
three
acts
should
be
made
extensive
in
their
reach
with
the
sherman
act,
they
can
go
over
to
congress
and
try
to
get
them
enacted
and
go
through
all
the
debates
that
will
occur
before
the
various
legislative
committees.
but
in
the
time
we
just
been
going
through
a
period
when
everybody
has
been
much
concerned
that
the
several
departments
of
the
government
stay
within
our
own
proper
ambit
and
at
a
time
like
that
that's
where
they
should
go
to
congress
not
to
this
court.
the
words
of
these
statutes
are
clear.
thank
you.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
in
the
few
moments
that
i
have
i
would
like
to
note
the
consequences
of
this
argument
that
just
been
made.
interstate
--
what
is
called
the
interstate
highway
480
is
a
stretch
of
street
in
san
francisco
of
about
12
blocks
in
length
running
from
the
so-called
barbary
coast.
if
a
man
should
pick
up
a
woman
or
abduct
her
and
carry
her
for
purpose
of
prostitution
over
those
12
blocks,
under
this
argument
you’ve
just
heard,
that
man
would
have
violated
the
dyer
act,
the
mann
act,
and
that
lindbergh
kidnapping
act
because
he
would
have
transported
the
kidnapped
person
in
a
stolen
automobile
if
he
had
a
stolen
automobile
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
only
other
thing
i
wish
to
say
is
on
the
subject
that
effect
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
6
discusses
the
subject
and
concludes,
i
conclude
that
the
local
activities
of
the
defendants
with
regard
to
as
all
the
concrete
did
not
have
a
substantial
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
counselor
said
this
is
not
a
impact
or
effect
case
and
is
relying
on
the
arbitrary
notion
that
because
asphaltic
concrete
went
into
a
road
as
part
of
it
connects
with
other
roads
it
crosses
the
state
line
it
is
in
the
interstate
commerce.
and
with
that
submission,
he
has
so
largely
abandoned
the
bulk
of
his
own
brief
which
was
an
argument
along
the
lines
of
that
of
the
solicitor
general.
i
submit
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
interstate
commerce
in
three
sections
of
the
clayton
act.
section
2
which
is
the
robinson-patman
act,
section
3
which
is
the
provision
prohibiting
certain
tie-in
arrangements
and
section
7
which
is
commonly
called
the
celler-kefauver
act
or
amendment
which
has
to
do
with
mergers
and
acquisitions.
the
case
does
not
involve
any
question
at
all
of
what
congress’
has
powers
are.
it
involves
no
question
what
congress
can
do.
it
only
involves
the
question
of
what
in
fact
it
has
seen
fit
to
do
by
the
legislation
it
has
enacted.
now
the
starting
point,
i
assume
of
any
consideration
of
what
an
act
of
congress
means
is
the
language
of
the
act
of
congress.
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
the
three
acts
that
i
speak
of
are
much
the
same
and
are
to
be
contrasted
with
the
provision
of
the
sherman
act
because
they
are
much
narrower.
now,
each
one
of
these
three
acts,
each
one
requires
that
the
proscribed
conduct
have
an
effect
and
an
impact
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
now,
i'll
use
the
word
“commerce”
hereafter
for
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
the
language
of
the
three
is
identical.
it
is
required
that
the
“effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
attempt
to
create
a
monopoly
in
the
line
of
commerce”
and
in
this
respect
these
three
are
identical
with
the
sherman
act.
they
require
an
effect
or
impact
on
interstate
commerce,
but
the
sherman
act
requires
no
more.
under
the
sherman
act
it
makes
no
difference
who
commits
the
conduct
or
where
it
occurs
if
it
has
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
but
here
under
these
three
clayton
act
sections,
much
more
is
required.
effect
or
impact
which
is
expressly
spelled
out
and
required
is
only
one
of
several
of
the
tests
of
jurisdiction
mandated
by
these
acts.
robinson-patman
requires,
in
addition
to
the
effect
or
impact,
that
the
discriminatory
sale
would
be
and
i
quote
“by
a
person
engaged
in
commerce,
in
the
course
of
such
commerce”
and
again
a
discrimination
requires
at
least
two
sales
to
have
a
discrimination
between
it
requires
“either
or
any
of
the
purchasers
involved
must
be
in
commerce,”
that’s
in
addition
to
the
effect
or
impact
clause.
section
3
has
almost
the
identical
language.
it
requires
that
the
tie-in
conduct
be
that
of
a
“person
engaged
in
commerce
in
the
course
of
such
commerce.”
in
section
7,
the
anti-acquisition
section,
requires
not
only
that
the
effect
be
adverse
on
a
line
of
commerce,
but
that
the
acquiring
corporation
be
“a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce”
and
in
addition,
that
the
acquired
corporation
be
a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce.
now,
before
we
go
further
to
discuss
the
effect
of
the
act
besides
from
this
case,
it's
necessary
to
find
out
what
product
we’re
talking
about
because
that's
the
key
to
this
case.
the
product
involved
in
this
case
is
a
substance
known
as
asphaltic
concrete,
not
asphalt.
and
i
emphasize
it
is
not
liquid
asphalt
because
liquid
asphalt
moves
in
interstate
commerce
and
while
this
case
started
is
one
of
what
later
became
a
consolidated
as
the
western
liquid
asphalt
cases,
the
trial
court
carved
out
the
asphaltic
concrete
aspects
of
it
and
left
the
liquid
asphalt
aspect
still
going,
they're
still
in
the
court,
they're
still
proceeding
with
the
rest
of
the
western
liquid
asphalt
cases.
asphaltic
concrete,
let
me
say
when
the
court
carved
it
out,
the
court
said
at
the
beginning
there
seem
to
be
a
jurisdictional
element
upon
asphaltic
concrete.
it
directed
the
plaintiff
to
take
all
the
discovery
he
needed
on
the
jurisdictional
elements,
come
back
and
make
a
showing
and
when
that
occurred,
the
court
ruled
out
the
asphaltic
concrete
elements.
asphaltic
concrete
is
a
product
made
in
california
and
which
by
its
very
nature
cannot
be
sold
across
the
state
line.
it's
a
bulky
product,
composed
of
95%
of
rocks,
sand
and
gravel
which
is
mined
in
the
local
pits
and
the
other
5%
is
liquid
asphalt,
also
produced
in
california
from
california
refineries.
this
material
is
used
as
a
topping,
black
top,
streets,
roadways,
driveways.
in
order
to
make
it,
you
mix
the
rock
with
hot
asphalt
in
a
hot
plant
and
the
product
has
to
be
laid
down
before
it
cools.
consequently,
it
has
to
be
laid
down
within
35
miles
from
the
plant
where
it's
made.
that
means
it
can't
move
in
interstate
commerce.
the
hot
plants
of
all
the
parties
in
this
case
are
located
in
california.
the
hot
plants
of
the
plaintiff
were
all
located
in
the
los
angeles
basin.
the
hot
plants
of
the
acquired
corporation
involved
in
the
section
7
aspect
of
this
case,
sully-miller
are
all
located
in
the
los
angeles
basin,
that
is
to
say
los
angeles
county
and
the
suburbs
around
it.
none
of
the
asphaltic
concrete
made
or
sold
involved
in
this
case
ever
got
within
200
miles
of
an
interstate
border
of
california.
now,
the
robinson-patman
in
section
3
accounts
concerns
sales
of
asphaltic
concrete
by
the
petitioner,
industrial
asphalt.
it
is
accused
of
having
discriminated
and
yet
none
of
its
asphaltic
concrete
sales
ever
got
within
200
miles
from
the
california
border.
none
of
never
crossed
the
state
line,
none
of
never
could
cross
a
state
line.
now,
the
section
7
count
involves
the
acquisition
by
union
oil
company
which
is
not
in
the
asphaltic
concrete
business
of
one
sully-miller.
sully-miller
has
its
plants
solely
in
los
angeles
county
and
the
neighborhood
of
orange
county
and
makes
asphaltic
concrete
from
local
materials,
sells
it
within
a
35
mile
range
from
los
angeles.
it
also
engages
as
a
paving
contractor
and
the
complaint,
the
amended
complaint
in
this
case
alleged
that
sully-miller's
business
was
engaged
--
being
engaged
primarily
in
the
business
of
operating
asphaltic
concrete,
hot
plants
and
contracting
street
improvements.
it's
a
street
paver
and
all
--
this
appears
at
the
appendix
of
page
15.
it
is
plants
from
the
los
angeles
basin.
it's
a
contractor
in
paving
streets
in
that
particular
area,
all
200
miles
or
thereabouts
from
the
border.
now
upon
this
state
of
undisputed
fact,
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
sections
2,
3
and
7
were
absent.
it
said
that
the
robinson-patman
act
did
not
apply
because
no
sale
by
industrial
of
asphaltic
concrete
was
in
commerce.
no
sale
was
made
in
the
course
of
commerce.
for
the
same
reason
they
held
that
the
section
3,
the
tie-in
section
did
not
apply
and
it
held
that
section
7
did
not
apply
to
union's
acquisition
of
sully-miller
for
the
simple
reason
that
sully-miller
was
not
a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce.
i
may
add
that
the
district
court
also
found
there
wasn't
any
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
it
had
given
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
every
opportunity
show
their
jurisdictional
facts.
this
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
an
interlocutory
appeal,
allowed
under
1292-b
and
that
court
reversed.
now,
until
the
decision
in
this
case,
it
had
been
the
uniformed
decision
of
a
mass
of
cases,
the
robinson-patman
does
not
apply
unless
at
least
one
of
the
sales,
involving
a
discrimination
crosses
a
state
line.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
this
state
line
test
and
it
did
it
because
it
said
asphaltic
concrete
is
used
on
streets
and
roads.
streets
and
roads
of
all
hook
up
and
eventually
something
crosses
the
state
line,
so
you
have
an
interstate
highway
system.
therefore,
the
roads
and
the
streets
are
linked
up
to
“an
instrumentality
of
commerce”
and
therefore
said
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
seller
and
the
sale
are
engaged
in
commerce.
as
for
sully-miller,
it
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
was
engaged
in
commerce
because
it
sold
asphaltic
concrete
for
use
on
roads
and
because
it
paved
streets,
as
i
say
all
200
miles
from
an
interstate
border.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
the
finding
of
no
effect
on
the
interstate
commerce
because
it
said
that
because
an
interstate
instrumentality
of
commerce
was
involved
a
road,
everybody
was
engaged
in
commerce
and
if
you're
engaged
in
commerce
the
effect
for
all
those
as
a
matter
of
law,
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
that.
this
court,
we
petitioned
for
cert
--
on
the
certiorari
upon
the
sherman
act
issue
and
certiorari
was
not
allowed
on
that
so
that's
not
before
us.
the
proposition
we
advance
now
is
that
the
judgment
and
decision
was
wrong
because
no
sales
were
made
in
commerce
by
anybody
engaged
in
commerce
and
nobody
engaged
in
commerce
was
acquired.
now,
just
this
year
on
may
24th,
the
fifth
circuit
in
scranton
construction
versus
litton
industries
reported
in
494
f2d
778
referred
to
the
decision
below
the
very
one
i'm
here
on
now,
it
referred
to
it
as
a
“new
deliverance”
and
refused
to
follow
it.
now,
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
this
new
rule
of
law
and
yet
now
that
we're
here,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
barely
defended.
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
the
other
day
in
which
he
urges
that
sections
3
and
7
should
be
read
as
if
they
were
coextensive
with
the
sherman
act.
in
other
words,
you
delete
all
of
the
language
above
sales
in
commerce,
but
in
the
course
of
commerce
by
a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
and
treat
the
acts
as
if
they
required
no
more
than
the
sherman
act
and
curiously
enough
he
says
nothing
about
the
robinson-patman
act,
he
just
talks
about
section
3
and
section
7.
we
know
of
course
that
the
department
of
justice
in
the
antitrust
division
had
never
been
lovers
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
apparently
they
don't
seem
to
defend
the
decision,
but
the
language
of
those
sections
were
all
the
same
and
whatever
decision
is
made
about
3
or
7,
would
of
necessity
have
apply
the
robinson-patman
section
2.
the
principal
argument
made
in
respondent’s
brief
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
solicitor's
general,
namely
that
with
respect
to
all
of
these
acts,
robinson-patman
2
and
7,
they
should
be
read
as
expansively
as
the
sherman
act
and
that
nothing
is
required
other
than
effect
on
commerce.
now,
if
i
maybe
forgiven
to
characterize
them,
i
would
say
that
these
two
lines
of
argument
are,
1,
would
work
surgery
by
excising
the
specific
provisions
of
robinson-patman
sections
3
and
7
and
the
other,
that
of
the
court
below
is
applying
lsd
to
the
language
and
get
--
arriving
at
a
rather
strange
interpretation.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
reason
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
great
chief
justice
treanor
of
california
once
wrote
about
the
use
of
magic
words
as
if
the
use
of
a
certain
phraseology,
somehow
decided
the
case
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
that’s
what
the
ninth
circuit
did.
it
picks
up
the
words,
interstate
highway
which
has
an
inflated
sound
divorced
from
reality,
but
tax
--
a
compulsive
significance
to
that
and
then
also
we'll
look
for
analogy
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
is
an
act
of
quite
different
language,
purpose
and
background.
the
court
below
talks
about
interstate
highways
and
if
the
court
please,
that
is
not
a
legal
term.
it
is
a
loose
terminology
for
roads,
for
whose
construction
the
federal
government
under
grant
made
statute,
the
federal
highway
aid
act
contributes
money.
it
does
so
for
forest
roads,
trails,
farm
to
market
roads,
local
rural
roads,
streets,
parkways,
county
roads,
and
also
state
roads
selected
to
connect
the
principal
centers.
respondent
called
on
the
petitioners
to
admit
by
request
for
admission
and
we
did
admit
that
98.5%
of
these
funds
received
by
the
state
of
california
went
to
county
roads.
we've
already
observed
that
sully-miller
was
a
street
paver
in
the
suburbs
of
los
angeles.
all
roads
for
which
federal
aid
is
given
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state,
local
governments.
federal
act,
the
aid
highway
act
does
not
presume
to
regulate
highways
or
operations
of
those
working
on
them
or
supplying
materials
for
them.
it
does
do
more
than
attached
conditions
with
a
gift
and
none
of
those
conditions
have
anything
to
do
with
the
problems
of
this
case.
and
so
i
respectfully
submit
that
what
the
decision
of
the
court
below
comes
to
is
to
advance
this
proposition,
“since
every
street
in
every
city
and
every
road
anywhere
in
united
states
unless
it
connects
with
other
is
part
of
an
interstate
network
of
highways.
therefore,
the
seller
of
anything
used
in
a
street
or
a
road
is
in
commerce
and
by
that
reasoning
the
local
society
for
the
care
over
the
blind
that
sells
brooms
made
by
the
blind
for
use
to
sweeping
the
streets
or
the
streets
cleaner,
or
the
tow
truck
operator
who
removes
illegally
parked
cars
on
the
streets,
all
are
engaged
in
commerce.”
now,
this
court
over
and
over
again
in
its
interstate
commerce
decisions
has
said
that
the
conception
--
the
concept
of
commerce
is
guided
by
the
most
practical
considerations.
commerce
is
an
intensely
practical
concept
drawn
from
the
normal
and
accepted
course
of
business,
these
are
statements
the
court
has
made.
now,
if
this
case
concerned
workers
constructing
a
lock
across
the
canal
or
a
draw
bridge
across
the
mississippi,
one
might
see
such
an
immediacy
to
their
operation
of
an
interstate
facility
that
you
might
come
to
the
conclusion
there
practically
that
the
construction
of
that
bridge
was
an
interstate
commerce,
but
i
submit
that
from
any
practical
reality,
selling
asphaltic
concrete
to
put
on
a
street
or
a
road,
200
miles
from
the
border
simply
is
a
horse
of
another
color
and
so
of
paving
a
city
street.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
get
back
to
our
fundamental.
our
system
of
government
is
federalism,
certainly
where
a
federal
statute
plainly
applies.
it
has
to
be
applied,
but
when
to
apply
it
is
going
to
intrude
upon
local
policies
and
to
apply
it
requires
some
procrustean
treatment,
some
stretching
then
we've
been
taught
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
hand
is
stayed.
now,
the
philosophy
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
a
highly
debatable
one.
this
court
has
frequently
commented
how
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
philosophy
of
the
sherman
act.
california
is
considered
that
robinson-patman
and
has
deliberately
refused
to
adapt
the
robinson-patman
type
statute.
california's
supreme
court
reviewing
the
matter
has
said
no.
california
has
no
robinson-patman
type
of
statute
and
has
noted
this
conflict
of
policy
and
yet
what
has
happened
here
is
that
a
federal
act
has
been
extended
in
the
california
area
to
something
local
on
misconception
that
asphaltic
concrete
is
put
upon
a
road.
now
if
the
court
please,
california
also
has
not
adapted
any
general
anti-acquisition
statute.
the
proposed
uniform
state
antitrust
law
has
deliberately
left
out
a
section
7
type
of
provision
on
the
idea
that
acquisitions
at
a
local
level
have
a
different
impact
and
deal
with
different
kind
of
policies
and
on
a
national
level.
so
we
say
again,
the
question
here
is
not
how
far
congress
could
go.
i
think
congress
could
go
to
full
length
here
if
it
wished
to.
how
far
has
it
gone
and
in
deciding
that
question,
respect
has
to
be
paid
first
to
the
language
congress
has
used
and
secondly,
to
the
federal
structure
of
the
union.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
company
--
both
of
them.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
the
requirement
of
section
7
is
your
honor
notes
is
that
the
companies,
the
acquirer
and
the
acquiring
each
must
be
engaged.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
doubt
it.
but
the
evidence
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
except
the
sully-miller
is
not.
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
the
plaintiff
was
called
on
to
produce
all
his
evidence,
complete
discovery
as
to
what
sully-miller
did
and
sully-miller
is
simply
a
local
paving
contractor
and
manufacturer
of
this
stuff
for
local
stuff.
mr.
moses
lasky
no
evidence
whatever
on
that
aspect.
the
respondent
produced
no
evidence
whatever
on
it
but
the
only
business
it's
in
--
mr.
moses
lasky
there
is
a
--
one
could
take
a
guess
of
course
that
it
buys
its
machinery
and
one
might
guess
that
the
machinery
may
have
originated
originally
out
of
the
state,
probably
came
into
rest
in
the
state,
but
there's
no
evidence
on
the
record
on
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
may
or
may
not
be,
it
depends
--
perhaps
on
how
they
bought
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh!
i
--
again,
the
record
is
silent
on
it
but
i
would
have
to
take
a
guess
that
they
do.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
would
guess
they
do.
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon?
mr.
moses
lasky
i
don't
know.
there
are
large
assembly
plants
in
california
of
all
kinds
on
machinery.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
evidence,
that
is
right.
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
again,
i
repeat
the
court
called
upon
the
respondent
to
take
all
the
discovery
and
produce
all
the
evidence
that
they'd
wished
to
bring
to
bear
on
the
subject
and
they
said
nothing
about
this.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
wouldn't
think
that
put
them
on
commerce
either.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
sir.
i
suppose
if
there
was
a
constant
flow
of
trucks
here
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
and
--
very
well,
they
may
be
buying
them
locally
from
local
distributors.
again,
while
it's
in
the
record
we
all
know
that
this
kind
of
machinery
is
sold
by
local
distributors.
mr.
moses
lasky
we
would
be
talking
about
different
things.
we
would
be
talking
about
different
things,
but
i
can
only
talk
about
the
things
in
the
record
and
i
can
only
reply
to
the
arguments
my
opponents
have
presented.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
it's
silent.
the
record
is
silent
on
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
that's
right.
mr.
moses
lasky
that's
right,
exactly
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
based
upon
that
one
fact
that
a
road
is
an
instrumentality
of
commerce.
the
asphaltic
concrete
went
into
the
road
therefore
it
was
as
a
matter
of
law
engaged
in
commerce.
that's
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
not
strongly
defended
as
i
say.
it's
being
defended
--
even
the
judgment
is
being
defended
on
the
notion
that
these
--
you
just
ignore
the
provisions
of
these
laws
and
say
that
congress
intended
to
exercise
its
commerce
power
to
the
utmost
using
exactly
the
language
which
has
often
been
used
about
the
sherman
act.
now
may
i
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
when
we
said
35
miles
everybody
has
been
talking
generously,
the
evidence
that
talks
about
5
to
50.
i
think
if
we
had
a
case
in
delaware,
a
hot
plant
operator
in
delaware,
you
might
have
a
different
problem
because
the
hot
plant
might
very
well
be
crossing
the
border,
but
you
get
--
that
border
around
southern
california
surrounds
largely
desert
area.
but
again
one
can
conceive
where
a
hot
plant
operator
might
be
of
the
crossing
state
lines.
here,
it
did
not.
mr.
moses
lasky
he
might
very
well.
that
would
be
a
different
case.
then
we'd
have
at
least
one
sale
crossing
a
state
line
then
we'd
have
the
counterpart
of
sully-miller
engaged
in
paving
all
around
here,
you'd
have
interstate
commerce?
that's
a
different
case
and
the
decision
we
asked
the
court
to
render
here
is
not
going
to
be
the
last
decision.
it’s
going
to
be
asked
to
rendering
in
questions
like
this.
now,
the
second
advice
from
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
is
that
it
appeals
to
the
analogy
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
that
act
provides
for
minimum
wages
not
only
to
employees
engaged
in
commerce,
but
also
to
employees
“engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.”
and
this
court
by
a
divided
decision
held
that
the
last
words
even
meant
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
those
engaged
in
commerce
based
upon
the
particular
legislative
history
of
that
act.
amendments
to
that
act,
divided
definitions
whereby
if
some
employees
who
are
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce,
all
employees
of
the
same
employer
are
deemed
brought
under
the
act
and
congress
could
do
that
sort
of
thing
on
robinson-patman
in
section
3
and
unquestionably
on
section
7
if
it
wished
to
do
so,
but
it
hasn't
done
so.
now,
if
the
court
please,
and
this
brings
me
to
the
solicitor
general's
line
of
argument
which
i
think
i
can
answer
very
quickly.
whenever
congress
has
got
on
legislate,
conflicting
views
of
politics,
economics,
sociology
are
pressed
upon
congress,
each
one
contending
for
an
option
and
in
the
end
congress
draws
a
line
and
makes
compromises.
now,
one
can
grant
that
legislation
is
to
be
given
a
scope
commensurate
with
congress’
purposes
and
aims,
but
congress
is
the
only
judge
not
only
of
its
goals
but
of
the
means
it
wishes
to
advance
them
and
of
the
compromises
it
wishes
to
make
among
the
contending
factors.
and
the
only
way
congress
has
to
express
the
solution
and
the
compromises
that
it's
forced
to
make
is
in
words.
now,
here
the
words
are
absolutely
clear,
not
to
be
ignored.
and
talking
about
the
sherman
act,
this
court
for
example
in
the
southeastern
underwriters
case
said
the
words
of
the
sherman
act
were
all
comprehensive.
any
person
who
restrains
trade
falls
under
the
ban
of
that
act.
here,
we
have
an
english
language
of
body
of
terms
each
of
separate
meaning,
each
having
an
--
with
an
ascending
order
of
reach.
we
have
in
commerce.
we
have
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
we
have
production
of
a
working
on
instrumentalities
of
commerce.
we
have
the
words
affecting
commerce
and
each
one
reaches
out
a
little
further
and
the
affecting
commerce
reaches
out
to
the
farthest
extent
of
the
law.
these
words
compromise
an
armory
from
which
congress
can
draw
when
it
wishes
to
express
of
its
particular
purpose
and
if
the
court
is
to
treat
all
these
words
as
synonymous
as
you're
being
asked
to
do
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
respectfully
submit
that
corrupts
the
language,
corrupts
the
law
and
it
impoverishes
congress
because
it
takes
away
from
congress
words
it
can
use.
and
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
words
selected
so
carefully
by
the
legislative
branch
such
as
engaged
in
commerce,
engaged
in
the
course
of
commerce
don't
mean
anymore
than
affecting
commerce
then
congress
is
going
to
be
hard
put
to
express
itself
when
it
doesn't
wish
to
exercise
the
commerce
power
to
its
fullest
extent.
it
will
be
driven
to
circumlocution,
negatives
and
provisos.
now
everybody
knows
the
legislative
history
of
the
robinson-patman
act
demonstrates,
that
robinson-patman
was
the
product
of
a
complex
series
of
legislative
proposals
ending
up
in
compromises
that
have
given
many
courts
headaches
in
trying
to
resolve
the
meaning.
i
was
quoting
at
that
point
from
the
meyer
paving
case
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari,
recently
in
414
us.
mr.
moses
lasky
robinson-patman?
robinson-patman
was
of
1936
amendment
to
section
2
of
clayton
which
was
1940.
mr.
moses
lasky
approx
--
yes,
1936.
enacted
incidentally
after
this
court
in
the
bendheim
brothers
case
or
the
darby
case
and
the
cases
involving
labor
relations
act
had
explicated
the
far
reach
of
power
that
congress
possessed.
no
doubt
as
to
that
this
court
by
the
time
congress
enacted
this
act
had
told
congress
that
it
had
the
most
extensive
power,
nevertheless,
there
was
no
extension
or
change
in
these
words.
similarly,
in
celler-kefauver
in
1951
--
50,
they
didn't
change
the
words
that
they
used
in
1914
despite
the
fact
that
they
could
have
and
gone
much
further.
i
submit
the
case
with
this
submission.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
still
sits
and
if
it
is
of
view,
the
department
of
justice
or
others,
these
three
acts
should
be
made
extensive
in
their
reach
with
the
sherman
act,
they
can
go
over
to
congress
and
try
to
get
them
enacted
and
go
through
all
the
debates
that
will
occur
before
the
various
legislative
committees.
but
in
the
time
we
just
been
going
through
a
period
when
everybody
has
been
much
concerned
that
the
several
departments
of
the
government
stay
within
our
own
proper
ambit
and
at
a
time
like
that
that's
where
they
should
go
to
congress
not
to
this
court.
the
words
of
these
statutes
are
clear.
thank
you.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
in
the
few
moments
that
i
have
i
would
like
to
note
the
consequences
of
this
argument
that
just
been
made.
interstate
--
what
is
called
the
interstate
highway
480
is
a
stretch
of
street
in
san
francisco
of
about
12
blocks
in
length
running
from
the
so-called
barbary
coast.
if
a
man
should
pick
up
a
woman
or
abduct
her
and
carry
her
for
purpose
of
prostitution
over
those
12
blocks,
under
this
argument
you’ve
just
heard,
that
man
would
have
violated
the
dyer
act,
the
mann
act,
and
that
lindbergh
kidnapping
act
because
he
would
have
transported
the
kidnapped
person
in
a
stolen
automobile
if
he
had
a
stolen
automobile
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
only
other
thing
i
wish
to
say
is
on
the
subject
that
effect
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
6
discusses
the
subject
and
concludes,
i
conclude
that
the
local
activities
of
the
defendants
with
regard
to
as
all
the
concrete
did
not
have
a
substantial
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
counselor
said
this
is
not
a
impact
or
effect
case
and
is
relying
on
the
arbitrary
notion
that
because
asphaltic
concrete
went
into
a
road
as
part
of
it
connects
with
other
roads
it
crosses
the
state
line
it
is
in
the
interstate
commerce.
and
with
that
submission,
he
has
so
largely
abandoned
the
bulk
of
his
own
brief
which
was
an
argument
along
the
lines
of
that
of
the
solicitor
general.
i
submit
the
case.
thank
you.
