mr.
martin
m.
shapero
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
petitioners
which
we
heard
yesterday
is
represented
by
two
basic
concepts.
each
of
which
fail
to
withstand
the
test
of
close
analysis,
their
first
proposition
is
that
in
this
case
the
issue
is
not
what
congress
could
do
but
what
it
did
do.
the
petitioners’
position
is
congress
did
not
intend
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws
to
builders
and
suppliers
of
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce,
that
fact
standing
alone.
this
position
is
incorrect
and
in
point
effect
congress
has
stated
both
generally
and
specifically
its
intent
that
the
antitrust
laws
apply
to
builders
and
suppliers
of
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
i'm
just
speaking
in
this
specific
context
and
herein
we
are
discussing
the
specific
question
of
instrumentalities
consisting
of
interstate
highways.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
i'm
speaking
specifically
of
this
case
your
honor
and
the
cases
that
i
have
to
support
it
in
the
statutes
that
i
have
to
support
it,
i
believe
are
practically
on
the
button
on
this
particular
situation.coming
to
the
second
proposition
which
we
believe
we
will
demonstrate
to
be
an
error
is
that
the
term
interstate
highway
has
no
meaning
and
it
is
not
a
term
of
art.
this
is
likewise
an
incorrect
position.
the
term
interstate
highway
has
a
recognized
meaning
both
in
law
and
in
fact.
the
two
misconceptions
go
to
the
essence
of
the
petitioners’
case
since
it
is
clear
that
if
congress
did
indeed
declare
its
intent
that
the
antitrust
laws
apply
to
instrumentalities
of
commerce
and
if
interstate
highways
are
clearly
understood
to
be
such
instrumentalities
then
this
petitioners
as
well
as
our
clients
as
builders
and
suppliers
of
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
are
subject
to
the
terms
and
provisions
of
each
and
all
of
the
antitrust
acts.
let
us
start
with
the
second
proposition
first.
does
the
term
interstate
highway
have
a
meaning?
is
it
a
term
of
art
or
is
it
something
which
has
no
significance
in
terms
of
the
law
or
the
english
language?
it
most
certainly
has
a
meaning
and
that
meaning
is
disclose
by
both
history
and
the
statements
of
this
court.
you
can
go
back
and
i
bring
you
old
law.
it
pays
at
this
time
to
go
back
to
the
language
of
gibbons
versus
ogden.
the
--
justice
marshall
speaking
says
the
subject
to
be
regulated
is
commerce
and
our
constitution
being
as
was
appellees
said
at
the
bar,
one
of
enumeration
and
not
of
definition
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
power
it
becomes
necessary
to
settle
the
meaning
of
the
word.
the
counsel
for
the
appellee
would
limit
it
to
traffic,
to
buying
and
selling
or
to
the
interchange
of
commodities
and
do
not
admit
that
it
comprehends
navigation.
this
would
restrict
a
general
term
applicable
to
many
objects
to
one
of
its
significations.
commerce
undoubtedly
is
traffic
but
it
is
something
more,
it
is
intercourse.
it
describes
the
commercial
intercourse
between
nations
and
parts
of
nations
and
all
its
branches
and
is
regulated
by
prescribing
rules
for
carrying
on
that
intercourse.
the
mind
can
scarcely
conceive
a
system
for
regulating
commerce
between
nations
which
shall
exclude
all
laws
concerning
navigation
which
shall
be
silent
on
the
admission
of
the
vessels
of
the
one
nation
into
the
forts
of
the
other
and
be
confined
to
prescribing
rules
for
the
conduct
of
the
individuals
in
the
actual
employment
of
buying
and
selling
or
barter.
perhaps
the
most
striking
example
of
the
close
and
intimate
intertwining
relationship
between
interstate
commerce
on
the
one
hand
and
the
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
on
the
other
is
the
fact
that
the
very
first
commission
in
this
country
which
was
formed
to
establish
and
control
--
which
was
established
to
control
the
railroads.
it
was
not
called
the
railroad
commission
and
it
was
not
even
called
the
transportation
commission.
it
was
called
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
no
one
certainly
at
this
stage
in
our
development
would
deny
that
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
to
control
railroads
under
the
commerce
power
as
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
does
not
exist.
and
what
is
the
relationship
then
between
interstate
highways
to
interstate
commerce.
we’re
now
approaching
the
case
at
bar
as
a
professor
sharfman
in
his
work
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission
states
as
follows,
“the
railroad
industry
is
no
more
than
a
century
old
than
the
motor
carriers
and
waterlines
whose
increasingly
severe
competition
it
has
been
encountering
in
recent
years
about
the
modern
counterparts
of
the
turnpikes
and
canals
which
had
largely
displaced
at
the
time
of
its
first
emergence
as
an
improved
source
of
transportation
service.”
justice
murphy
speaking
for
this
court
in
overstreet
versus
north
shore
corporation
put
it
as
follows,
“we
think
the
practical
test
should
govern
here.
vehicular
roads
and
bridges
are
as
indispensable
to
the
interstate
movement
of
persons
and
goods
as
railroad
tracks
and
bridges
are
to
interstate
transportation.”
if
they
are
used
by
persons
and
goods
passing
between
various
states
they
are
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce.
justice
black
speaking
in
alstate
versus
durkin
put
the
matter
vastly,
“in
overstreet,
we
pointed
out
that
the
interstate
roads
and
railroads
are
indispensable
instrumentalities
in
the
carriage
of
persons
and
goods
that
move
in
commerce.”
what’s
the
retort
of
the
petitioners
to
this
language?
the
retort
is
that
in
those
cases
they
were
talking
about
labor
laws,
fair
labor
standards
and
here
we’re
talking
about
another
kind
of
statute
but
let
us
look
at
the
highway
act
itself.
the
highway
act
which
is
23
united
states
code
section
103.
in
the
highway
act,
we
have
described
a
federal
primary
system,
a
federal
secondary
system,
a
federal
aid
urban
system,
and
lastly,
the
interstate
system
which
the
congress
in
the
highway
act
defines
as
follows.
the
interstates
--
“the
interstate
system
shall
be
designated
within
the
united
states
including
the
district
of
columbia
and
except
as
provided
in
paragraphs
1
and
2
of
this
subsection.
it
shall
not
exceed
41,000
miles
in
total
extent.”
it
shall
be
so
located
as
to
connect
by
roots
as
direct
us
practicable
the
principle
metropolitan
area,
cities,
and
industrials
centers
to
serve
the
national
defense
and
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
to
connect
at
suitable
border
points
with
roots
of
continental
importance
in
the
dominion
of
canada
and
the
republic
of
mexico.
the
roots
of
this
system
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
shall
be
selected
by
joint
action
of
the
state
highway
departments
of
each
state
and
the
adjoining
states
subject
to
the
approval
by
the
secretary
as
provided
in
subsection
(e)
of
this
section.
we
come
to
the
case
at
hand.
the
language
which
we
consider
critical
was
contained
in
a
stipulation
which
we
entered
into
very
early
in
this
case.
in
the
stipulation,
as
set
fourth
by
the
trial
court
reads
as
follows
“a
more
than
de
minimis
quantity
of
asphaltic
concrete
delivered
by
plaintiffs
and
their
competitors
is
delivered
for
use
on
interstate
highways.”
that’s
contained
in
the
record
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondent’s
brief
at
page
3.
i
submit
this
to
you
that
the
petitioners
at
the
time
they
entered
into
that
stipulation
well
understood
the
distinction
and
meaning
and
the
clear
--
the
clear
meaning
of
what
was
intended
and
what
is
intended
in
law
by
the
phrase
interstate
highway.
as
stated
in
the
respondent’s
complaint
at
page
17
and
18
of
the
appendix,
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
record
in
the
appendix
“defendants
gulf
union
and
edgington
sell
to
end
users
and
contractors
including
plaintiffs
substantial
quantities
of
hot
asphalt
--
oil
to
be
used
as
hot
asphalt
or
asphaltic
concrete
for
constructing,
maintaining,
surfacing,
resurfacing
and
repairing
roads
and
the
highways
including
federal
interstate
system
highways
and
highways
directly
connected
to
interstate
highways.
how
did
the
petitioners
respond
to
that?
they
admitted
those
very
phrases.
now,
i
can
represent
to
the
court.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
it
is
conceded
and
that
is
the
exactly
the
next
point
that
i
was
coming
to
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
is
conceded
and
they
admit
that
indeed
they
did
apply
this
to
interstate
highways.
the
petitioners
clearly
understood
at
that
point
and
my
point
is
that
by
making
the
concession
they
must
have
understood
the
distinction
between
interstate
highways
and
roads
which
are
merely
funded
by
federal
money
when
they
entered
into
the
stipulation,
otherwise,
the
stipulation
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
yes?
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
if
to
the
extent
that
the
particular
supplies
are
going
on
and
interstate
facility
i
would
say
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
i
believe
that
he
is
and
i
believe
that
the
congress
has
so
stated
and
intended
that
they
be
so
considered
and
that
would
be
my
next
point
that
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
where
congress
has
indeed
expressed
its
specific
intent
in
a
very
limited
area
and
that
very
limited
area
has
reference
to
the
specific
instrumentalities
of
intrastate
commerce
so
that
i'm
not
talking
in
this
case
about
a
big
spread
or
a
wide
expansion
of
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
i
must
remind
the
court
at
all
times
that
we’re
talking
about
interstate
--
an
interstate
instrumentality
so
that
we’re
talking
about
an
expansion
within
a
very,
very
confined
area
of
the
law
but
as
within
that
confined
area
congress
has
expressed
its
intent
which
i
will
come
to
shortly,
with
your
permission.
to
continue
my
point
to
enter
into
the
stipulation
which
they
entered
into,
that
the
amount
of
asphaltic
concrete
delivered
by
the
petitioner
and
their
competitors
would
by
definition
mean
that
all
the
paving
if
we
would
take
the
stipulation
as
its
interpreted
by
the
petitioners
it
would
mean
that
the
amount
of
asphaltic
concrete
delivered
by
the
petitioner
and
their
competitors
which
would
by
definition
mean
all
the
paving
done
in
southern
california
was
more
than
de
minimis.
this
would
simply
be
entering
into
a
nonsense
stipulation
because
the
terms
of
the
stipulation
would
mean
that
we
would
be
stipulating
that
all
the
pavers,
all
the
--
the
total
industry
in
southern
california
is
producing
all
the
roads
in
southern
california
and
all
that
activity
is
more
than
de
minimis,
if
the
stipulation
simply
has
no
meaning
whatsoever
unless
you
are
confining
it
to
the
specific
reference
of
the
interstate
instrumentality.
now
the
petitioners
i
would
submit
they
knew
better
than
this
one
they
entered
into
this
stipulation
and
they
are
pleadings
and
they’re
understanding
was
that
at
the
time
that
the
pleadings
were
drawn
at
the
time
that
we
entered
into
the
stipulation
that
we
were
tracking
the
use,
we
were
actually
tracking
statutory
language
and
the
statutory
language
we
were
tracking
in
the
statutory
language
which
as
justice
blackmun
points
out
that
they
admitted
was
the
specific
statutory
language
set
forth
on
the
highway
act
itself.
and
their
inability
at
this
point
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
interstate
highway
is
no
more
than
an
attempt,
i
would
submit,
to
remove
themselves
from
one
portion
of
a
syllogistic
box
which
they
find
themselves
in.
now,
let's
turn
to
the
first
issue
which
still
remains.
did
the
congress
express
the
intent
to
do
that
which
he
have
had
the
power
to
do
namely,
apply
the
antitrust
act
to
instrumentalities
of
commerce,
namely
interstate
highways
within
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
as
we’ve
now
demonstrated
the
phrase
has
a
meaning.
the
clayton
act
itself
expresses
the
congressional
purpose
and
intent
and
in
reference
to
the
instrumentalities
as
they
existed
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act
in
1914.
at
that
time
the
development
of
highways
had
not
yet
occurred
but
the
intent
of
the
congress
to
control
and
apply
antitrust
legislation
to
the
builders
and
suppliers
of
the
interstate
instrumentalities
was
clear
and
it
was
done
and
it
was
done
even
in
the
view
of
the
fact
that
the
railroads
were
natural
monopolies.
now,
the
specific
languages
contained
in
section
10
of
the
clayton
act
and
that’s
one
that’s
a
primary
act
that
we’re
concerned
with.
and
section
10
of
the
clayton
act
says
that
no
common
carrier
engaged
in
commerce
shall
have
any
dealings
and
securities,
supplies
or
other
articles
of
commerce
or
shall
have
any
contracts
for
construction
or
maintenance
of
any
kind
to
the
amount
of
more
than
$50,000
in
the
aggregate
in
any
one
year
with
another
corporation,
firm,
partnership,
or
association.
when
the
said
common
carriers
shall
have
upon
its
board
of
directors
or
as
its
president
manager
or
its
purchasing
or
selling
officer
or
agent
in
the
particular
transaction,
any
person
who
is
at
the
same
time
a
director
manager,
purchasing
or
selling
officer
or
who
has
any
substantial
interest
in
such
other
corporation,
firm,
partnership,
or
association
unless
and
accept
such
purchases
shall
be
made
from
or
such
dealing
shall
be
with
the
bidder
whose
bid
is
the
most
favorable
to
such
common
carrier
to
be
ascertained
by
competitive
bidding
under
the
regulations
to
this
prescribe
by
the
rules
or
otherwise
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
it
states
further
any
person,
any
person,
this
is
contained
within
the
clayton
act
itself,
any
person
who
shall
directly
or
indirectly
do
or
attempt
to
do
anything
to
prevent
anyone
from
bidding
or
shall
do
any
act
to
prevent
free
and
fair
competition
among
the
bidders
of
those
desiring
to
bid
shall
be
punished
as
prescribe
in
this
section
in
as
in
the
case
of
an
officer
or
director.
so
that
in
reference
to
the
construction
of
the
railroads,
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
is
spelled
out
perfectly
clear
in
referring
to
the
question
that
you
put
there
mr.
chief
justice.
that
here
we
have
a
specific
intent
of
the
congress
we
have
a
statement
by
the
petitioners
that
if
the
congress
declared
its
intent,
they
would
certainly
have
the
power
to
do
so.
here
we
have
a
specific
intent
set
forth
by
the
congress.
now
the
next
question
of
course
immediately
is
that’s
all
very
well
and
good
but
that
was
in
reference
to
the
railroad
that
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
highways.
we
have
the
same
specific
intent
which
is
set
forth
by
the
congress
within
the
highway
act
and
they
discussed
this
in
terms
of
maintaining
competition.
i
might
state
that
this
court
in
the
unanimous
opinion
--
in
a
unanimous
written
by
justice
douglas
stated
that
the
section
that
i
just
quoted
from
is
an
antitrust
act
and
mr.
justice
douglas
used
the
following
language
“it
is
pointed
out
that
the
railroads
scandals
of
that
age
were
not
limited
to
interlocking
directors
and
multiple
shareholders
but
that
suppliers
of
railroad
materials
had
made
substantial
gifts
to
the
railroad
officials
with
whom
they
dealt.
with
the
railroads
at
that
time
at
least
you
had
in
theory
at
any
rate
where
you
had
an
independent
entrepreneur
and
he
was
acquiring
supplies
for
his
road
he
had
at
least
the
impulse
and
unless
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
the
desire
to
hold
the
prices
down
but
we’re
you’re
dealing
with
public
highways
who
i
would
ask
the
court
is
the
entrepreneur
who
is
going
to
protect
the
public
under
those
circumstances.
and
the
congress
answered
that
question
and
the
congress
declared
that
their
both
mere
position
was
going
to
be
that
the
protector
of
the
public
under
those
circumstances
would
be
competition
and
they’ve
stated
so
and
they’ve
stated
so
specifically,
they
stated
the
under
letting
of
contracts
and
i'm
now
referring
to
section
--
to
23
section
112.
the
secretary
shall
require
as
a

now
that
is
a
clear
statement
of
congressional
intent.
they’ve
stated
it
even
further
at
section
304.
this
is
23
section
304
of
the
highway
act
it
states
it
is
declared
to
be
in
the
national
interest
to
encourage
and
develop
the
actual
and
potential
capacity
of
small
business
and
to
utilize
this
important
segment
of
our
economy
to
the
fullest
practicable
extent
in
construction
of
the
federal
highways
systems
including
the
interstate
system.
now,
what’s
the
answer
of
the
petitioners
to
this?t
hey
say
these
aren’t
directives.
that
it’s
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
ignore
each
one
of
these
items
if
they
so
choose.
all
they
have
to
do
is
forego
the
federal
funds
and
this
i
would
submit
to
you
is
introducing
a
new
doctrine
that
unlike
debt,
taxes
are
no
longer
inevitable.
all
you
have
to
do
is
give
up
income
because
the
fundamental
facts
of
life
are
today
in
the
united
states
that
the
money
that’s
available
for
the
construction
of
highways
is
available
through
the
federal
government
and
that’s
the
only
way
that
this
highways
are
going
to
be
constructed.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
no,
absolutely
not
to
that
doctrine
has
already
been
considered
and
rejected
by
the
court.
the
source
of
the
money
does
not
give
the
federal
government
the
power.
the
power
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
particular
highway
is
itself
an
integral
part
of
the
interstate
process.
all
that
i'm
stating
is
that
this
is
a
designation
and
a
recitation
of
what
the
congressional
intent
was.
the
intent
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws
to
an
interstate
construction
of
highways
because
certainly
in
terms
of
the
protection
of
the
public
the
advantages
and
the
necessity
for
having
a
competition
is
just
as
wrong
if
its
paid
for
by
the
state
of
california
as
if
the
particular
highway
is
paid
for
by
the
federal
government.
we
still
need
the
same
protection
and
that
is
the
fundamental
purpose
of
these
statutes
and
why
they
are
essential
as
far
as
the
construction
of
the
highways
are
concerned.
because
the
competition
has
the
ability
of
limiting
and
i
put
(inaudible)
aside,
by
putting
it
aside
i
don’t
say
that
it
doesn’t
exist
but
i
put
it
aside.
the
other
factors
what
becomes
a
proper
measure
of
profit,
what
formulas
do
you
use?
all
these
matters
are
eliminated
automatically
by
the
presence
of
competition
and
we
have
the
clear
expression
of
congress
which
states
that
what
the
congress
is
looking
for
is
not
what
in
the
constructions
of
the
highway,
what
they
looking
for
is
not
so
much
that
when
they
want
to
build
their
highway
they
don’t
want
to
look
to
a
company,
they
want
to
look
and
have
the
ability
of
looking
to
an
industry
in
order
to
build
that
highway
and
in
order
to
do
it
they
have
declared
that
we
must
maintain
the
integrity
in
full
competition.
now,
the
extent
there
has
been
--
there
were
some
discussion
yesterday
that
was
put
in
terms
of
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
government
had
participated
in
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
government
had
made
contributions
and
we
have
the
record
is
very
full
with
specific
references
as
to
the
extent
of
the
federal
contribution
that
we
have
made.
for
example
at
page
172
of
the
appendix,
i
invite
your
attention
to
examining
the
fact
that
in
one
year
for
example
$294
million
went
in
to
the
national
system
of
interstate
and
defense
highways
in
california
alone
for
the
year
1972-1973.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
yes.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
this
is
not
an
effect
case,
we
are
in
commerce.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
we
don’t
rely
on
the
effect
doctrine
this
is
“in
commerce”
case.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
well,
the
district
court
never
considered
the
problems
specifically
that
district
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
effect
on
commerce
and
therefore
through
all
of
the
acts,
it
made
no
distinction
when
it
ruled,
it
threw
out
everything
because
it
failed
to
find
an
effect
on
commerce
under
the
sherman
act.
and
since
the
sherman
act
failed,
then
it
ruled
that
all
four
of
the
acts
failed,
so
that
the
district
court
made
no
distinction
whatsoever.
i
might
say
that
i
think
you
have
an
effect
on
commerce
almost
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
very
language
of
the
district
court
itself
were
it
spelled
out
that
we
already
have
75%
and
this
is
from
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
that
we
have
75%
of
the
road
construction
in
southern
california
now
being
built
by
two
parties
industrial
and
sully-miller
each
of
which
are
owned
in
turn
by
two
large
oil
companies
gulf
and
industrial.
so
that
we
are
already
approaching
an
effect
doctrine
because
the
trial
court
again
in
the
trial
court
opinions
says
that
where
you
have
monopoly
you
presumably
would
have
such
an
effect
and
we
are
approaching
already
by
the
trial
courts
own
findings
such
a
monopoly
situation.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you
for
your
time.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
petitioners
which
we
heard
yesterday
is
represented
by
two
basic
concepts.
each
of
which
fail
to
withstand
the
test
of
close
analysis,
their
first
proposition
is
that
in
this
case
the
issue
is
not
what
congress
could
do
but
what
it
did
do.
the
petitioners’
position
is
congress
did
not
intend
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws
to
builders
and
suppliers
of
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce,
that
fact
standing
alone.
this
position
is
incorrect
and
in
point
effect
congress
has
stated
both
generally
and
specifically
its
intent
that
the
antitrust
laws
apply
to
builders
and
suppliers
of
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
i'm
just
speaking
in
this
specific
context
and
herein
we
are
discussing
the
specific
question
of
instrumentalities
consisting
of
interstate
highways.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
i'm
speaking
specifically
of
this
case
your
honor
and
the
cases
that
i
have
to
support
it
in
the
statutes
that
i
have
to
support
it,
i
believe
are
practically
on
the
button
on
this
particular
situation.coming
to
the
second
proposition
which
we
believe
we
will
demonstrate
to
be
an
error
is
that
the
term
interstate
highway
has
no
meaning
and
it
is
not
a
term
of
art.
this
is
likewise
an
incorrect
position.
the
term
interstate
highway
has
a
recognized
meaning
both
in
law
and
in
fact.
the
two
misconceptions
go
to
the
essence
of
the
petitioners’
case
since
it
is
clear
that
if
congress
did
indeed
declare
its
intent
that
the
antitrust
laws
apply
to
instrumentalities
of
commerce
and
if
interstate
highways
are
clearly
understood
to
be
such
instrumentalities
then
this
petitioners
as
well
as
our
clients
as
builders
and
suppliers
of
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
are
subject
to
the
terms
and
provisions
of
each
and
all
of
the
antitrust
acts.
let
us
start
with
the
second
proposition
first.
does
the
term
interstate
highway
have
a
meaning?
is
it
a
term
of
art
or
is
it
something
which
has
no
significance
in
terms
of
the
law
or
the
english
language?
it
most
certainly
has
a
meaning
and
that
meaning
is
disclose
by
both
history
and
the
statements
of
this
court.
you
can
go
back
and
i
bring
you
old
law.
it
pays
at
this
time
to
go
back
to
the
language
of
gibbons
versus
ogden.
the
--
justice
marshall
speaking
says
the
subject
to
be
regulated
is
commerce
and
our
constitution
being
as
was
appellees
said
at
the
bar,
one
of
enumeration
and
not
of
definition
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
power
it
becomes
necessary
to
settle
the
meaning
of
the
word.
the
counsel
for
the
appellee
would
limit
it
to
traffic,
to
buying
and
selling
or
to
the
interchange
of
commodities
and
do
not
admit
that
it
comprehends
navigation.
this
would
restrict
a
general
term
applicable
to
many
objects
to
one
of
its
significations.
commerce
undoubtedly
is
traffic
but
it
is
something
more,
it
is
intercourse.
it
describes
the
commercial
intercourse
between
nations
and
parts
of
nations
and
all
its
branches
and
is
regulated
by
prescribing
rules
for
carrying
on
that
intercourse.
the
mind
can
scarcely
conceive
a
system
for
regulating
commerce
between
nations
which
shall
exclude
all
laws
concerning
navigation
which
shall
be
silent
on
the
admission
of
the
vessels
of
the
one
nation
into
the
forts
of
the
other
and
be
confined
to
prescribing
rules
for
the
conduct
of
the
individuals
in
the
actual
employment
of
buying
and
selling
or
barter.
perhaps
the
most
striking
example
of
the
close
and
intimate
intertwining
relationship
between
interstate
commerce
on
the
one
hand
and
the
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
on
the
other
is
the
fact
that
the
very
first
commission
in
this
country
which
was
formed
to
establish
and
control
--
which
was
established
to
control
the
railroads.
it
was
not
called
the
railroad
commission
and
it
was
not
even
called
the
transportation
commission.
it
was
called
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
no
one
certainly
at
this
stage
in
our
development
would
deny
that
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
to
control
railroads
under
the
commerce
power
as
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
does
not
exist.
and
what
is
the
relationship
then
between
interstate
highways
to
interstate
commerce.
we’re
now
approaching
the
case
at
bar
as
a
professor
sharfman
in
his
work
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission
states
as
follows,
“the
railroad
industry
is
no
more
than
a
century
old
than
the
motor
carriers
and
waterlines
whose
increasingly
severe
competition
it
has
been
encountering
in
recent
years
about
the
modern
counterparts
of
the
turnpikes
and
canals
which
had
largely
displaced
at
the
time
of
its
first
emergence
as
an
improved
source
of
transportation
service.”
justice
murphy
speaking
for
this
court
in
overstreet
versus
north
shore
corporation
put
it
as
follows,
“we
think
the
practical
test
should
govern
here.
vehicular
roads
and
bridges
are
as
indispensable
to
the
interstate
movement
of
persons
and
goods
as
railroad
tracks
and
bridges
are
to
interstate
transportation.”
if
they
are
used
by
persons
and
goods
passing
between
various
states
they
are
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce.
justice
black
speaking
in
alstate
versus
durkin
put
the
matter
vastly,
“in
overstreet,
we
pointed
out
that
the
interstate
roads
and
railroads
are
indispensable
instrumentalities
in
the
carriage
of
persons
and
goods
that
move
in
commerce.”
what’s
the
retort
of
the
petitioners
to
this
language?
the
retort
is
that
in
those
cases
they
were
talking
about
labor
laws,
fair
labor
standards
and
here
we’re
talking
about
another
kind
of
statute
but
let
us
look
at
the
highway
act
itself.
the
highway
act
which
is
23
united
states
code
section
103.
in
the
highway
act,
we
have
described
a
federal
primary
system,
a
federal
secondary
system,
a
federal
aid
urban
system,
and
lastly,
the
interstate
system
which
the
congress
in
the
highway
act
defines
as
follows.
the
interstates
--
“the
interstate
system
shall
be
designated
within
the
united
states
including
the
district
of
columbia
and
except
as
provided
in
paragraphs
1
and
2
of
this
subsection.
it
shall
not
exceed
41,000
miles
in
total
extent.”
it
shall
be
so
located
as
to
connect
by
roots
as
direct
us
practicable
the
principle
metropolitan
area,
cities,
and
industrials
centers
to
serve
the
national
defense
and
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
to
connect
at
suitable
border
points
with
roots
of
continental
importance
in
the
dominion
of
canada
and
the
republic
of
mexico.
the
roots
of
this
system
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
shall
be
selected
by
joint
action
of
the
state
highway
departments
of
each
state
and
the
adjoining
states
subject
to
the
approval
by
the
secretary
as
provided
in
subsection
(e)
of
this
section.
we
come
to
the
case
at
hand.
the
language
which
we
consider
critical
was
contained
in
a
stipulation
which
we
entered
into
very
early
in
this
case.
in
the
stipulation,
as
set
fourth
by
the
trial
court
reads
as
follows
“a
more
than
de
minimis
quantity
of
asphaltic
concrete
delivered
by
plaintiffs
and
their
competitors
is
delivered
for
use
on
interstate
highways.”
that’s
contained
in
the
record
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondent’s
brief
at
page
3.
i
submit
this
to
you
that
the
petitioners
at
the
time
they
entered
into
that
stipulation
well
understood
the
distinction
and
meaning
and
the
clear
--
the
clear
meaning
of
what
was
intended
and
what
is
intended
in
law
by
the
phrase
interstate
highway.
as
stated
in
the
respondent’s
complaint
at
page
17
and
18
of
the
appendix,
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
record
in
the
appendix
“defendants
gulf
union
and
edgington
sell
to
end
users
and
contractors
including
plaintiffs
substantial
quantities
of
hot
asphalt
--
oil
to
be
used
as
hot
asphalt
or
asphaltic
concrete
for
constructing,
maintaining,
surfacing,
resurfacing
and
repairing
roads
and
the
highways
including
federal
interstate
system
highways
and
highways
directly
connected
to
interstate
highways.
how
did
the
petitioners
respond
to
that?
they
admitted
those
very
phrases.
now,
i
can
represent
to
the
court.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
it
is
conceded
and
that
is
the
exactly
the
next
point
that
i
was
coming
to
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
is
conceded
and
they
admit
that
indeed
they
did
apply
this
to
interstate
highways.
the
petitioners
clearly
understood
at
that
point
and
my
point
is
that
by
making
the
concession
they
must
have
understood
the
distinction
between
interstate
highways
and
roads
which
are
merely
funded
by
federal
money
when
they
entered
into
the
stipulation,
otherwise,
the
stipulation
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
yes?
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
if
to
the
extent
that
the
particular
supplies
are
going
on
and
interstate
facility
i
would
say
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
i
believe
that
he
is
and
i
believe
that
the
congress
has
so
stated
and
intended
that
they
be
so
considered
and
that
would
be
my
next
point
that
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
where
congress
has
indeed
expressed
its
specific
intent
in
a
very
limited
area
and
that
very
limited
area
has
reference
to
the
specific
instrumentalities
of
intrastate
commerce
so
that
i'm
not
talking
in
this
case
about
a
big
spread
or
a
wide
expansion
of
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
i
must
remind
the
court
at
all
times
that
we’re
talking
about
interstate
--
an
interstate
instrumentality
so
that
we’re
talking
about
an
expansion
within
a
very,
very
confined
area
of
the
law
but
as
within
that
confined
area
congress
has
expressed
its
intent
which
i
will
come
to
shortly,
with
your
permission.
to
continue
my
point
to
enter
into
the
stipulation
which
they
entered
into,
that
the
amount
of
asphaltic
concrete
delivered
by
the
petitioner
and
their
competitors
would
by
definition
mean
that
all
the
paving
if
we
would
take
the
stipulation
as
its
interpreted
by
the
petitioners
it
would
mean
that
the
amount
of
asphaltic
concrete
delivered
by
the
petitioner
and
their
competitors
which
would
by
definition
mean
all
the
paving
done
in
southern
california
was
more
than
de
minimis.
this
would
simply
be
entering
into
a
nonsense
stipulation
because
the
terms
of
the
stipulation
would
mean
that
we
would
be
stipulating
that
all
the
pavers,
all
the
--
the
total
industry
in
southern
california
is
producing
all
the
roads
in
southern
california
and
all
that
activity
is
more
than
de
minimis,
if
the
stipulation
simply
has
no
meaning
whatsoever
unless
you
are
confining
it
to
the
specific
reference
of
the
interstate
instrumentality.
now
the
petitioners
i
would
submit
they
knew
better
than
this
one
they
entered
into
this
stipulation
and
they
are
pleadings
and
they’re
understanding
was
that
at
the
time
that
the
pleadings
were
drawn
at
the
time
that
we
entered
into
the
stipulation
that
we
were
tracking
the
use,
we
were
actually
tracking
statutory
language
and
the
statutory
language
we
were
tracking
in
the
statutory
language
which
as
justice
blackmun
points
out
that
they
admitted
was
the
specific
statutory
language
set
forth
on
the
highway
act
itself.
and
their
inability
at
this
point
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
interstate
highway
is
no
more
than
an
attempt,
i
would
submit,
to
remove
themselves
from
one
portion
of
a
syllogistic
box
which
they
find
themselves
in.
now,
let's
turn
to
the
first
issue
which
still
remains.
did
the
congress
express
the
intent
to
do
that
which
he
have
had
the
power
to
do
namely,
apply
the
antitrust
act
to
instrumentalities
of
commerce,
namely
interstate
highways
within
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
as
we’ve
now
demonstrated
the
phrase
has
a
meaning.
the
clayton
act
itself
expresses
the
congressional
purpose
and
intent
and
in
reference
to
the
instrumentalities
as
they
existed
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act
in
1914.
at
that
time
the
development
of
highways
had
not
yet
occurred
but
the
intent
of
the
congress
to
control
and
apply
antitrust
legislation
to
the
builders
and
suppliers
of
the
interstate
instrumentalities
was
clear
and
it
was
done
and
it
was
done
even
in
the
view
of
the
fact
that
the
railroads
were
natural
monopolies.
now,
the
specific
languages
contained
in
section
10
of
the
clayton
act
and
that’s
one
that’s
a
primary
act
that
we’re
concerned
with.
and
section
10
of
the
clayton
act
says
that
no
common
carrier
engaged
in
commerce
shall
have
any
dealings
and
securities,
supplies
or
other
articles
of
commerce
or
shall
have
any
contracts
for
construction
or
maintenance
of
any
kind
to
the
amount
of
more
than
$50,000
in
the
aggregate
in
any
one
year
with
another
corporation,
firm,
partnership,
or
association.
when
the
said
common
carriers
shall
have
upon
its
board
of
directors
or
as
its
president
manager
or
its
purchasing
or
selling
officer
or
agent
in
the
particular
transaction,
any
person
who
is
at
the
same
time
a
director
manager,
purchasing
or
selling
officer
or
who
has
any
substantial
interest
in
such
other
corporation,
firm,
partnership,
or
association
unless
and
accept
such
purchases
shall
be
made
from
or
such
dealing
shall
be
with
the
bidder
whose
bid
is
the
most
favorable
to
such
common
carrier
to
be
ascertained
by
competitive
bidding
under
the
regulations
to
this
prescribe
by
the
rules
or
otherwise
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
it
states
further
any
person,
any
person,
this
is
contained
within
the
clayton
act
itself,
any
person
who
shall
directly
or
indirectly
do
or
attempt
to
do
anything
to
prevent
anyone
from
bidding
or
shall
do
any
act
to
prevent
free
and
fair
competition
among
the
bidders
of
those
desiring
to
bid
shall
be
punished
as
prescribe
in
this
section
in
as
in
the
case
of
an
officer
or
director.
so
that
in
reference
to
the
construction
of
the
railroads,
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
is
spelled
out
perfectly
clear
in
referring
to
the
question
that
you
put
there
mr.
chief
justice.
that
here
we
have
a
specific
intent
of
the
congress
we
have
a
statement
by
the
petitioners
that
if
the
congress
declared
its
intent,
they
would
certainly
have
the
power
to
do
so.
here
we
have
a
specific
intent
set
forth
by
the
congress.
now
the
next
question
of
course
immediately
is
that’s
all
very
well
and
good
but
that
was
in
reference
to
the
railroad
that
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
highways.
we
have
the
same
specific
intent
which
is
set
forth
by
the
congress
within
the
highway
act
and
they
discussed
this
in
terms
of
maintaining
competition.
i
might
state
that
this
court
in
the
unanimous
opinion
--
in
a
unanimous
written
by
justice
douglas
stated
that
the
section
that
i
just
quoted
from
is
an
antitrust
act
and
mr.
justice
douglas
used
the
following
language
“it
is
pointed
out
that
the
railroads
scandals
of
that
age
were
not
limited
to
interlocking
directors
and
multiple
shareholders
but
that
suppliers
of
railroad
materials
had
made
substantial
gifts
to
the
railroad
officials
with
whom
they
dealt.
with
the
railroads
at
that
time
at
least
you
had
in
theory
at
any
rate
where
you
had
an
independent
entrepreneur
and
he
was
acquiring
supplies
for
his
road
he
had
at
least
the
impulse
and
unless
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
the
desire
to
hold
the
prices
down
but
we’re
you’re
dealing
with
public
highways
who
i
would
ask
the
court
is
the
entrepreneur
who
is
going
to
protect
the
public
under
those
circumstances.
and
the
congress
answered
that
question
and
the
congress
declared
that
their
both
mere
position
was
going
to
be
that
the
protector
of
the
public
under
those
circumstances
would
be
competition
and
they’ve
stated
so
and
they’ve
stated
so
specifically,
they
stated
the
under
letting
of
contracts
and
i'm
now
referring
to
section
--
to
23
section
112.
the
secretary
shall
require
as
a
condition
precedent
to
his
approval
of
each
contract
awarded
by
competitive
bidding
pursuant
to
subsection
(b)
of
this
section
and
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
section
a
sworn
statement
executed
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
person,
firm,
association,
or
corporation
to
whom
such
contract
is
to
be
awarded
certifying
that
such
person,
firm,
association,
or
corporation
has
not
either
directly
or
indirectly
entered
into
any
agreement
participated
in
any
collusion
or
otherwise
taken
any
action
in
restraint
of
free
competitive
bidding
in
connection
with
such
contract.
now
that
is
a
clear
statement
of
congressional
intent.
they’ve
stated
it
even
further
at
section
304.
this
is
23
section
304
of
the
highway
act
it
states
it
is
declared
to
be
in
the
national
interest
to
encourage
and
develop
the
actual
and
potential
capacity
of
small
business
and
to
utilize
this
important
segment
of
our
economy
to
the
fullest
practicable
extent
in
construction
of
the
federal
highways
systems
including
the
interstate
system.
now,
what’s
the
answer
of
the
petitioners
to
this?t
hey
say
these
aren’t
directives.
that
it’s
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
ignore
each
one
of
these
items
if
they
so
choose.
all
they
have
to
do
is
forego
the
federal
funds
and
this
i
would
submit
to
you
is
introducing
a
new
doctrine
that
unlike
debt,
taxes
are
no
longer
inevitable.
all
you
have
to
do
is
give
up
income
because
the
fundamental
facts
of
life
are
today
in
the
united
states
that
the
money
that’s
available
for
the
construction
of
highways
is
available
through
the
federal
government
and
that’s
the
only
way
that
this
highways
are
going
to
be
constructed.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
no,
absolutely
not
to
that
doctrine
has
already
been
considered
and
rejected
by
the
court.
the
source
of
the
money
does
not
give
the
federal
government
the
power.
the
power
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
particular
highway
is
itself
an
integral
part
of
the
interstate
process.
all
that
i'm
stating
is
that
this
is
a
designation
and
a
recitation
of
what
the
congressional
intent
was.
the
intent
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws
to
an
interstate
construction
of
highways
because
certainly
in
terms
of
the
protection
of
the
public
the
advantages
and
the
necessity
for
having
a
competition
is
just
as
wrong
if
its
paid
for
by
the
state
of
california
as
if
the
particular
highway
is
paid
for
by
the
federal
government.
we
still
need
the
same
protection
and
that
is
the
fundamental
purpose
of
these
statutes
and
why
they
are
essential
as
far
as
the
construction
of
the
highways
are
concerned.
because
the
competition
has
the
ability
of
limiting
and
i
put
(inaudible)
aside,
by
putting
it
aside
i
don’t
say
that
it
doesn’t
exist
but
i
put
it
aside.
the
other
factors
what
becomes
a
proper
measure
of
profit,
what
formulas
do
you
use?
all
these
matters
are
eliminated
automatically
by
the
presence
of
competition
and
we
have
the
clear
expression
of
congress
which
states
that
what
the
congress
is
looking
for
is
not
what
in
the
constructions
of
the
highway,
what
they
looking
for
is
not
so
much
that
when
they
want
to
build
their
highway
they
don’t
want
to
look
to
a
company,
they
want
to
look
and
have
the
ability
of
looking
to
an
industry
in
order
to
build
that
highway
and
in
order
to
do
it
they
have
declared
that
we
must
maintain
the
integrity
in
full
competition.
now,
the
extent
there
has
been
--
there
were
some
discussion
yesterday
that
was
put
in
terms
of
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
government
had
participated
in
the
extent
to
which
the
federal
government
had
made
contributions
and
we
have
the
record
is
very
full
with
specific
references
as
to
the
extent
of
the
federal
contribution
that
we
have
made.
for
example
at
page
172
of
the
appendix,
i
invite
your
attention
to
examining
the
fact
that
in
one
year
for
example
$294
million
went
in
to
the
national
system
of
interstate
and
defense
highways
in
california
alone
for
the
year
1972-1973.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
yes.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
this
is
not
an
effect
case,
we
are
in
commerce.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
we
don’t
rely
on
the
effect
doctrine
this
is
“in
commerce”
case.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
well,
the
district
court
never
considered
the
problems
specifically
that
district
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
effect
on
commerce
and
therefore
through
all
of
the
acts,
it
made
no
distinction
when
it
ruled,
it
threw
out
everything
because
it
failed
to
find
an
effect
on
commerce
under
the
sherman
act.
and
since
the
sherman
act
failed,
then
it
ruled
that
all
four
of
the
acts
failed,
so
that
the
district
court
made
no
distinction
whatsoever.
i
might
say
that
i
think
you
have
an
effect
on
commerce
almost
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
very
language
of
the
district
court
itself
were
it
spelled
out
that
we
already
have
75%
and
this
is
from
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
that
we
have
75%
of
the
road
construction
in
southern
california
now
being
built
by
two
parties
industrial
and
sully-miller
each
of
which
are
owned
in
turn
by
two
large
oil
companies
gulf
and
industrial.
so
that
we
are
already
approaching
an
effect
doctrine
because
the
trial
court
again
in
the
trial
court
opinions
says
that
where
you
have
monopoly
you
presumably
would
have
such
an
effect
and
we
are
approaching
already
by
the
trial
courts
own
findings
such
a
monopoly
situation.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
martin
m.
shapero
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you
for
your
time.
