justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
a
private
anti-trust
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondents
who
were
the
complainants
were
below
are
in
the
business
of
making
asphaltic
concrete.
this
product
used
for
servicing
highways
must
be
delivered
within
a
radius
of
some
35
miles
from
the
“hot
plants”
that
make
it.
the
defendants
in
the
suit
included
oil
companies
which
provide
the
liquid
petroleum
ingredient
for
the
asphalt
and
two
of
their
subsidiaries
which
compete
with
complainants.
all
sales
involved
in
this
case
were
made
exclusively
intrastate
in
the
los
angeles
area.
but
a
portion
of
the
asphaltic
concrete
was
used
to
construct
local
segments
of
interstate
highways.
the
plaintiffs
allege
various
violations
of
the
robinson-patman
and
clayton
acts.
the
question
that
comes
to
us
in
view
of
the
local
nature
of
the
asphaltic
concrete
market
is
whether
these
acts
are
applicable.
the
complainants
contend
that
they
are
since
the
asphalt
goes
into
interstate
highways
that
are
instrumentalities
of
commerce.
this
view
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
however
take
a
different
view.
the
language
of
robinson-patman
and
the
clayton
acts
is
not
as
expansive
as
that
of
the
sherman
act.
the
acts
here
involve
apply
to
forbidden
transactions
in
commerce.
we
hold
first
that
use
in
interstate
highways
is
not
enough
to
place
these
transactions
in
commerce
as
a
matter
of
law.
nor
do
we
think
these
transactions
come
within
these
acts
simply
because
they
may
affect
commerce.
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
robinson-patman
act
do
not
support
and
effects
on
commerce
theory.
and
as
to
the
clayton
act
provisions,
there
are
no
showings
that
the
alleged
restraints
had
any
effect
on
commerce
in
this
case.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
marshall
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
douglas
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joined.
