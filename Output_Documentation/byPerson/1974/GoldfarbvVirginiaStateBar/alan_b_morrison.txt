mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
early
1962,
the
committee
on
economics
of
law
practice
of
the
virginia
state
bar
issued
its
report
on
minimum
fees.
the
opening
sentence
of
that
report
neatly
summarizes
its
intent
and
sets
the
background
against
which
the
activities
of
the
respondents
must
be
judged.
“the
lawyers
have
slowly
but
surely
been
committing
economic
suicide
as
a
profession.”
the
remedy
suggested
by
the
state
bar,
minimum
fee
schedules
to
be
adopted
by
the
local
bars
in
the
state,
patterned
on
the
suggested
schedule
contained
in
the
state
bar's
own
fee
report.
shortly
thereafter,
the
respondent
fairfax
county
bar
association,
effective
may
1,
1962
adopted
its
own
fee
schedule
for
the
first
time,
essentially,
the
same
fee
schedules
that
suggested
in
the
state
bar's
report.
that
fee
schedule
continued
in
effect
unchanged
for
a
period
of
seven
years
until
the
virginia
state
bar
once
again
issued
another
fee
report
by
a
similar
committee
to
the
one
that
issued
the
first
one.
this
report
reflected
“a
general
scaling
up
of
fees.”
the
report
indicated
it
was
necessary
because
of
escalating
costs
and
spiraling
increase
in
the
cost
of
living.
the
court
--
the
committee
acknowledged
that
there
were
substantial
differences
between
some
of
the
old
schedules.
and
the
new
fees
for
title
examinations
which
are
the
services
particularly
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
title
examination
charge
went
to
1%
of
the
purchase
price
of
the
home
up
to
$50,000.00
and
a
half
of
1%
thereafter.
we
can
read
through
the
minimum
fee
schedule
reports
of
the
state
bar
and
the
minimum
fees
schedules
of
the
fairfax
bar
in
vain
to
find
a
single
reference
to
any
protection
of
the
public
interest
or
the
promotion
of
quality
legal
services
at
a
reasonable
cost,
but
there
are
indications
of
what
these
fees
schedules
and
reports
were
intended
to
do.
in
1962
report,
the
state
bar
says
that
fees
schedule
should
be
promulgated
because
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
virginia
state
bar
and
in
1969,
the
fairfax
report
noted
that
the
fee
schedule
will
enhance
the
prestige
of
the
state
bar,
but
the
state
bar
here
was
not
content
merely
to
publish
its
own
fee
reports
and
to
allow
the
local
bar
associations
to
publish
their
own
fee
schedules.
it
wanted
to
put
some
teeth
behind
these
fee
schedules
to
be
sure
that
they
would
be
followed
and
so,
it
issued
two
ethical
opinions.
one,
in
1960
and
one
in
1971,
opinions
number
98
and
170
and
in
substance
these
two
fee
opinions
state
that
any
attorney
in
virginia
who
habitually
charges
less
than
the
minimum
fee
schedule
amount
shall
be
presumed
to
have
acted
unethically
and
can
be
subject
to
discipline
on
proceedings
brought
by
the
virginia
state
bar
in
the
state
courts
of
virginia.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
does
your
honor
and
it
suggested
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
have
never
been
any
disciplinary
proceedings
brought
for
that
very
reason.
however,
i
think
it's
also
important
to
note
that
the
record
does
show
two
other
factors
in
that
regard.
number
one;
one
of
the
attorneys
to
whom
the
goldfarb's
wrote
suggested
in
its
response
to
their
letter
about
what
kind
of
fees
they
could
expect
to
pay
that
he
felt
that
he
was
ethically
required
to
adhere
to
the
schedule.
and
it
was
also
stipulated
between
the
parties
that
the
existence
of
these
two
opinions
was
a
substantial
influencing
factor
in
the
adherence
found
by
the
district
court
to
the
fee
schedules
in
northern
virginia.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
think
there's
anything
that
directly
responds.
i
would
refer
to
stipulation
number
20
which
is
in
petitioner's
appendix
at
page
--
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
at
page
19
and
i
think
that
that
about
says
what
could
be
found
and
agreed
upon.
i
don't
think
there's
any
thing
further
in
the
findings
with
regard
to
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
any
event,
it
is
no
small
wonder
based
upon
this
history
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
page
19
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
blue.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no
your
honor,
that
was
one
of
the
findings
of
fact
that
was
included
in
the
trial
court's
opinion.
i'm
sorry,
it
was
presented
in
connection
with
our
petition
and
was
therefore
not
required
to
be
reproduced.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
right.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is
no
small
wonder
that
the
goldfarb's
were
unable
to
find
a
lawyer
who
would
charge
them
less
than
the
minimum
fee
for
title
examination
for
their
home.
they
indeed
wrote
36
letters
to
attorneys
in
northern
virginia
who
had
expressed
interest
in
real
state
practice
work.
they
received
19
replies,
none
of
which
indicated
a
willingness
to
charge
less
and
in
almost
every
case,
the
reply
was
something
to
the
effect
that
the
fee
is
established
by
the
fairfax
county
bar
association
or
i
know
none
of
my
brethren
who
would
charge
any
less
and
i
feel
that
i'm
ethically
required
to
adhere
to
those
charges.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
we
assert
that
the
virginia
state
bar
has
two
very
important
roles
in
this
matter.
first,
the
promulgation
of
the
fee
reports
in
1962
which
got
the
ball
rolling
in
northern
virginia.
and
then,
in
1969
when
they
effectuated
the
revision
of
the
fee
suggestion
and
i
might
point
out
your
honor
that
in
1969,
the
increase
in
the
minimum
fee
for
title
examination
alone
was
an
increase
of
67%.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
precisely.
indeed,
i
would
say
beyond
inviting,
they
suggested,
recommended
that
the
local
bars
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
say
your
honor
that
the
virginia
bar
has
been
given
the
authority
to
issue
ethical
opinions
by
the
state
court
of
virginia.
there
is
nothing
any
place
that
indicates
that
they
were
ever
specifically
given
the
authority
to
publish
fee
schedules
or
fee
reports
or
ethical
opinions,
enforcing
minimum
fee
schedules.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
say
that's
correct,
your
honor
but
that
even
if
there
were
authority
under
virginia
law
that
is
we,
in
this
case
are
not,
i
don't
believe
deciding
a
question
of
whether
that
the
issuance
of
these
reports
is
somehow
violation
of
virginia
law.
although,
in
the
parker-brown
area,
it
does
become
of
some
relevance
and
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
we
do
say
that
it
was
in
administrative
agency
the
state
for
only
very
limited
purposes.
the
statute
upon
which
the
state
bar
relies,
section
54-49
of
the
virginia
code
says
that
the
virginia
state
bar
has
the
authority
to
act
as
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
even
if
we
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
authority
was
so
broad
to
the
virginia
state
bar
that
there
was
nothing
that
prohibited
the
state
bar
from
issuing
fee
reports
or
these
ethical
opinions
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
parker
versus
brown
that
that
would
not
be
sufficient
to
create
an
antitrust
exemption
that
there
needs
to
be
more
and
that
as
we'll
show
later
on
that
they
have
not
met
those
tests
here.
as
i
say
i
have
discussed
these
matters
relating
the
importance
of
the
virginia
state
bar
because
two
of
the
judges
in
this
case,
the
district
court
judge
and
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
both
suggested
that
the
state
bar
was
immune
because
of
what
they
termed
the
state
bar's
minor
role.
i
think
that
any
realistic
assessment
of
this
record
inevitably
reaches
the
conclusion
that
the
state
bar
was,
if
not
the
prime
mover,
certainly
a
co-equal
partner
in
this
entire
matter.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
further
the
issuance
of
the
two
fee
reports;
remember
1962,
the
state
bar
issued
the
fee
report,
that
was
the
first
time
that
one
was
issued
in
northern
virginia,
fee
schedule
followed
back
and
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
only
very
slight
your
honor.
most
of
it
was
a
recommendation
to
the
local
bar
associations
to
adopt
fee
schedules
and
contained
in
that
recommendation
was
not
simply
the
suggestion
“go
out
to
figure
out
your
own
fee
schedule,”
but
these
are
the
fees
that
you
ought
to
charge
and
indeed
the
fees
that
were
actually
contained
in
the
fairfax
schedule
and
in
other
schedules
were
virtually
identical
in
both
1962
and
again
in
1969
when
the
scaling
up
took
place.
so,
that's
a
very
important
factor
in
moving
ahead
of
the
advent
of
fee
schedules
in
northern
virginia.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
never.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
state
bar
has
so
represented
and
we
are
unaware
of
any
cases.
it
of
course
being
to
the
economic
advantage
of
an
attorney,
if
the
fee
schedules
working
across
the
board
effectively
where
none
of
his
brethren
are
going
to
undercut
him,
there
is
very
well
economic
incentive
to
violate,
but
in
any
event
it
has
not
been
violated.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
on
that
general
theory,
although
there
need
be
a
specific
requirements
of
solicitation
in
the
sense
that
the
lawyer
need
not
advertise
or
go
out
to
tell
people
that
he
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
if
he
consistently
undercuts,
if
he
charges
three
quarters
of
a
percent
of
the
purchase
price
or
break
--
makes
the
break
at
25
instead
of
$50,000.00
that's
considered
unethical
or
if
he
charges
on
the
basis
of
time
or
the
value
of
the
services
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
precisely
correct
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
that
general
theory,
yes
your
honor,
that
fact
alone
would
be
sufficient.
this
of
course
is
different
from
the
american
bar
association's
position.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right,
but
there
must
be
more,
there
must
be
more.
it
can
be
taken
into
account
as
a
factor
but
it
is
not
sufficient
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
certainly
never
counsel
this
court
or
any
one
to
adopt
any
sort
of
situation
under
which
the
lawyers
were
required
to
charge
any
sort
of
minimum
fee
such
as
that.
i
would
say
that
the
lawyer
should
be
left
free
to
determine
the
amount.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
there
are
bars
all
around
the
country
for
which
there
are
no
minimum
fee
schedules.
indeed,
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
indeed,
i
would
point
out
that
during
the
course
of
this
proceeding,
the
arlington
county
bar
association
and
the
city
of
alexandria
bar
association
withdrew
their
minimum
fee
schedules
in
order
to
settle
this
case
out.
and
indeed,
on
the
16th
day
of
september
of
this
very
year
while
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
pending,
the
fairfax
county
bar
association,
the
respondent
in
this
case
withdrew
its
own
minimum
fee
schedule
thereby
belying
any
notion
that
they
are
necessary
to
ensure
the
maintenance
of
ethical
standards
and
to
ensure
that
attorneys
do
quality
work.
i
hope
your
honor
that
we
can
rely
upon
the
members
of
the
bar
by
means
other
than
minimum
fee
schedules
not
to
do
shoddy
work
and
that
i
would
never
suggest
that
we
ought
to
establish
any
kind
of
fee
schedule
maximum,
minimum,
or
anything
else.
those
are
matters
to
be
left
to
the
marketplace
for
each
individual
attorney
to
decide
what
his
services
are
worth
and
what
a
reasonable
fee
ought
to
be.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
would
say
first
thing
i
would
do
before
i
hung
up
my
shingle
is
i
will
go
around
and
talk
to
my
fellow
members
of
the
bar.
i
would
ask
them,
what
is
the
kind
of
rate
they
charge?
there
are
courses
these
days
in
law
and
economics,
the
bar
may
have
an
obligation
to
teach
lawyers
in
some
senses
when
they're
going
out
in
their
own,
how
to
figure
out
whether
they're
going
to
make
enough
money.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
that
maybe
a
purpose,
but
that
would
be
a
purpose
at
almost
any
other
form
of
price
fixing
and
we
don't
allow
any
antitrust
laws
and
i
think
congress
wisely
said,
“no,
that's
not
what
we're
going
to
permit.”
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
if
he
felt
that
was
a
fair,
just
and
reasonable
fee,
absolutely
your
honor.
indeed,
i
would
say
the
first
amendment
would
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
state
could
not
prohibit
a
lawyer
from
discussing
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
if
they've
asked
them
what
they
in
fact
charged
your
honor
with
respect
to
a
particular
matter
perhaps
so
that
if
they're
asking,
“what
are
you
charging
for
a
particular
price?”
but
to
find
out
what
is
the
going
rate
on
divorces,
i
would
say
that
that
certainly
ought
not
to
be
even
under
the
reasoning
of
this
court's
decision
in
container
corporation
that
that
would
not
be
prohibited
from
finding
out
that
kind
of
general
pricing
information
for
someone
who
is
just
starting
out
in
the
business.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
that
is
a
matter
of
great
concern
to
me
personally.
i've
been
working
quite
closely
with
the
number
of
organizations
in
that
area
and
i
would
think
that
the
favorable
outcome
in
this
case
would
aid
the
development
of
prepaid
legal
services
that
the
bar
could
properly
do
many
things
in
the
prepaid
area.
although,
the
justice
department's
position
with
respect
to
prepaid
legal
services
under
bar
established
programs
under
which
the
bar
sets
all
the
fees
without
any
kind
of
consumer
input
at
all,
without
any
statutory
authority
or
court
authority
to
promulgate
fees
without
any
kind
of
openness
in
the
process,
may
not
be
sufficiently
strong
to
qualify
under
parker-brown
exemption.
but
those
matters
can
be
cured
and
i
would
have
to,
your
honor
look
at
the
specifics
of
a
particular
prepaid
legal
services
program.
those
programs
in
which
for
instance
a
group
of
consumers
entered
into
an
agreement
with
a
law
firm
to
provide
services
that
a
given
fee
would
be
no
different
than
any
corporation
or
any
other
entity
providing
services.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
there
is
your
honor
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
a
certiorari,
there
is
a
resolution
which
is
their
full
statement.
it's
attached
as
appendix,
i
believe
it's
appendix
1
to
the
brief
from
the
fairfax
bar
and
that
is
the
only
statement
we
have
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
wouldn't
want
to
characterize
it
one
way
or
the
other,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
below,
majority,
relied
very
heavily
on
the
so-called
learned
profession
exemption
to
the
antitrust
laws
in
finding
immunity
for
the
bar
for
these
activities.
we
believe
that
that
reliance
was
misplaced
and
that
the
proper
focus
was
on
and
should
have
been
on
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
american
medical
association.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
it
was
immaterial
what
the
professions
of
the
defendants
were
who
were
charged
with
that
criminal
conspiracy
provided
that
a
affect
and
purpose
of
that
restraint
was
to
restrain
the
trade
of
group
health.
the
defendants
there
were
medical
society
and
21
doctors
who
opposed
the
establishment
of
prepaid
medical
services
in
matter
not
dissimilar
to
the
prepaid
legal
services
about
which
the
chief
justice
just
asked
me.
and
the
medical
societies
there
issued
rulings
which
said
that
it
was
unethical
for
a
lawyer,
excuse
me
for
a
doctor
to
work
for
group
health
and
that
it
was
unethical
for
other
doctor
to
consult
with
that
doctor
or
it's
unethical
for
a
hospital
to
and
threat
--
they
threatened
boycotts
of
hospitals
that
cooperated.
and
the
result
of
this
was
of
course
a
serious
impairment
of
the
proposal
to
deliver
prepaid
medical
services
to
the
workers
in
that
particular
case.
in
our
view,
the
court
–
court's
holding
there
that
the
profession
was
immaterial,
requires
a
rejection
of
the
attempt
of
the
bar
here
to
spread
an
ethical
umbrella
over
its
activities
and
to
insulate
it
from
the
true
effects
which
is
as
it
was
there
to
deprive
consumers
of
opportunity
for
the
free
market.
in
ama,
this
court
said
that
a
conspiracy
allegedly
aimed
at
restraining
or
destroying
competition
or
limiting
the
free
availability
of
medical
services
violated
the
sherman
act
and
it
surely
it
does
here
also.
i
want
to
turn
if
i
may
to
the
alternative
basis
upon
which
the
bar
can
escape,
if
“escape”
is
the
proper
word,
from
the
strictures
of
the
sherman
act
for
those
truly
legitimate
activities
which
the
bar
has
and
which
do
need
to
be
carried
forward.
now,
if
the
bar
can
establish
under
parker,
that
there
has
been
state
action
and
that
the
state
has
intended
to
replace
competition.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
certainly
true,
your
honor
and
to
the
extent
to
which
the
special
status
of
the
bar
becomes
relevant
of
course
it
is
in
the
rule
of
recent
cases
where
like
every
other
characteristics
of
a
business
or
an
industry
we
certainly
must
look
to
the
obligations
of
that
industry
in
its
peculiarities.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
gave
an
example
in
my
brief,
your
honor
of
lawyers
agreeing
that
60
years
is
an
appropriate
time
for
title
examination.
to
go
back
60
years
will
be
considered
prima
facie
reasonable
in
terms
of
what's
required.
now,
there
may
be
a
restraint.
i
would
think
it
would
be
satisfied
under
the
rule
of
reason,
but
the
restraint
there
would
be
simply
upon
the
internal
workings
of
the
profession
and
while
there
may
be
some
tangential
effect
of
the
public
in
the
long
run,
it
would
be
very
small
and
probably
be
protected.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
that
of
course
is
not
the
very
case
we
have
before
us.
we
have
price
fixing
and
however
i
would
say
your
honor
that
if
in
the
commercial
context
the
per
se
rule
applies
in
that
case.
then,
i
would
say
that
the
bar
to
escape
sherman
act
liability
would
have
to
come
either
under
parker-brown
directly
under
the
authority
to
regulate
or
under
a
specific
state
statute.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
read
the
case
cited
by
american
bar
association
and
if
i
have
to
extrapolate,
i
would
say
that
that
probably
is
a
per
se
violation.
there
has
been
no
decision
specifically
of
this
court
that's
reached
that
precise
question,
but
if
i
had
to
give
my
opinion
and
were
advising
a
client
i
would
say,
yes,
it
is
a
per
se
violation.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
say
your
honor
that
it
is
under
the
same
rule
and
that
if
the
bar
needs
an
exemption;
there
are
two
ways
that
the
bar
can
get
an
exemption.
under
parker-brown
where
there
is
meaningful
statement
regulation
where
there
is
an
important
state
end
to
be
achieved
by
that,
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
that
can
be
a
achieved
that
way.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right,
where
the
state
has
made
a
decision
to
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
exactly,
your
honor,
or
if
congress
as
congress
has
so
often
done
for
other
business
problems,
labor
unions,
the
airlines,
fair
trade
laws,
there
are
whole
raft
of
areas
in
which
congress
has
said,
no
competition
is
not
to
be
all
and
end
all
for
everybody,
not
on
the
state
by
state
business,
but
for
everybody
and
we
want
those
situations
to
be
covered
by
another
rule.
with
regard
to
parker-brown,
i
want
to
point
out
several
important
things
by
parker
that
are
different
from
this
particular
case.
in
parker
first,
there's
a
terribly
important
role
played
by
the
state
agriculture
commission
who
were
all
appointed
by
the
governor,
confirmed
by
the
senate
of
california.
one
of
them
included
the
state
agriculture
director
and
others
included
consumers
and
handlers
as
well
as
growers.
now,
these
individuals
made
the
key
and
essential
decisions
in
parker.
there
was
no
more
way
in
which
the
state
could
operate
that
program
unless
there
was
positive
specific
approval
given
by
these
individuals.
moreover,
there
had
to
be
beyond
that
a
good
deal
and
of
this
i
speak
of
the
specific
factual
findings
that
the
program
for
the
particular
industry
was
to
be
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
scheme,
an
insurance
against
any
form
of
unreasonable
profits
and
then,
after
full
hearings
and
full
determinations
that
competition
ought
to
be
replaced
in
that
particular
instance
by
some
other
form
of
control
in
order
to
preserve
the
agriculture
wealth
of
the
state
that
in
that
case,
the
court
held
yes,
there
was
an
exemption.
this
was
indeed
action
of
the
state.
we
don't
have
anything
about
that
kind
here.
the
real
activities
here
were
conducted
by
the
state
bar,
and
none
of
the
committees
who
issued
the
fee
schedules,
fee
reports,
wrote
the
ethical
opinions,
none
of
them
was
appointed
by
the
governor,
confirmed
by
the
state
senate.
there
were
no
hearings,
there
were
no
factual
findings,
there
was
no
kind
of
procedural
assurance
that
any
kind
of
policy
mandate
from
the
state
of
virginia
is
being
carried
out.
there
was
in
short
a
very
different
kind
of
situation
than
what
we
had
in
parker-brown.
the
state
supreme
court
has
done
only
two,
taken
two
actions
which
might
conceivably
be
brought
within
the
notion
of
an
approval
as
in
parker.
number
one,
the
canons
of
ethics
number
12
which
the
state
bar
adopted
verbatim
in
this
regard
from
the
aba's
canons
of
ethics,
indicated
that
in
determining
what
a
reasonable
fee
was
it
was
proper
to
consider
the
customary
fees
in
the
area
and
that
the
customary
fees
in
the
areas
included
proper
reference
to
minimum
fee
schedules,
that's
the
one
item.
then,
in
1969
and
1970
when
the
canons
of
ethics
were
replaced
by
the
code
of
professional
responsibility,
that
language
was
taken
out
and
the
question
of
reasonable
fees
was
again
included
and
in
ethical
consideration
2-18,
the
american
bar
association,
adopted
by
the
virginia
state
bar,
virginia
supreme
court
and
said
that
minimum
fee
schedules
are
some
guidance
and
what
a
reasonable
fee
is.
now,
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
approval
than
was
required
in
parker-brown.
there
was
no
consideration
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
either
the
ethical
opinions,
the
fee
reports
of
the
fee
schedules
and
most
particularly
there
was
no
consideration
of
the
numbers
involved.
how
much
was
reasonable
fee,
was
there
any
assurance
that
the
consumers
were
not
being
unfairly
abused
by
the
fee
schedules
as
there
was
in
parker?
none
of
that
took
place
here
and
we
suggest
that
that
is
a
fatal
flaw
in
the
entire
matter
by
which
the
minimum
fee
schedule
system
operated
in
virginia.
finally,
as
in
parker,
unlike
parker
rather,
there
are
no
statutes
here
which
give
an
indication
to
the
state
bar
or
anyone
else
that
these
activities
ought
to
be
carried
out
as
a
replacement
for
competition.
a
careful
statutory
scheme
was
taking
place
in
parker;
a
scheme
fully
consistent
with
the
federal
practice
and
indeed
a
scheme
intended
to
preserve
the
agricultural
wealth
of
the
state
without
unreasonable
profits.
and
further,
without
profits
in
a
situation
that
once
the
scheme
went
into
effect,
the
program
was
approved
after
these
long
hearings
and
findings
of
fact
that
it
no
longer
was
optional
that
it
became
mandatory
and
any
person
who
didn't
follow
that
scheme
for
the
growers
of
raisins
in
that
case
could
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
your
honor,
it
is
clear
that
if
all
of
the
developers
in
western
virginia
and
all
the
bankers
in
the
area
and
the
neighboring
areas,
and
all
the
real
state
brokers
and
sellers
of
title
insurance
had
gotten
together
and
published
minimum
fee
schedules
that
anyone
could
be
disciplined
for
not
adhering
to
them,
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
sherman
act
would
have
been
violated.
the
question
before
this
court
is,
are
lawyers
any
different
or
do
they
have
to
meet
the
test
that
everyone
else
has
to
meet?
we
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
in
error
in
reaching
the
contrary
conclusion
and
accordingly
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
the
question
that
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
the
commerce
matter.
we
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
is
entirely
correct
in
his
position
that
the
focus
should
beyond
the
activity
of
the
defendants
whereas
we
have
here
a
broad
base
conspiracy
involving
all
of
the
attorneys
in
northern
virginia
who
have
agreed
to
a
per
se
violation
constituting
price
fixing.
and
we
look
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
burke
against
ford
for
that
kind
of
analysis
where
we
plainly
have
a
restraint
against
title
examinations
which
are
not
only
an
integral
part
of
home
financing
in
northern
virginia,
but
absolute
necessity
because
under
the
opinions
of
the
virginia
bar,
only
lawyers
can
give
opinions
on
title
examination.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
complaint
is
directed
in
that
solely
toward
title
examination.
the
only
evidence
came
in
with
respect
to
title
examinations.
we
believe
however
that
once
the
fee
schedule
was
declared
unlawful
with
respect
to
that,
we've
met
our
jurisdictional
requirement
as
to
that
then
the
remainder
of
the
fee
schedule
also
must
be
declared
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right,
your
honor.[laughter]
on
the
assumption
that
you
didn't
have
any
relatives
in
another
state
or
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right.[laughter]
thats
right.
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
that
where
we
have
a
massive
involvement
as
we
have
here
with
interstate
commerce
that
once
we
have
established
this
jurisdictional
nexus
and
shown
that
the
transaction,
the
restraint
here
operates
on
an
integral
part
of
what
is
a
larger
interstate
transaction.
and
we
have
a
per
se
violation
that
under
burke
we
not
inquire
further.
as
the
court
said
there,
such
per
se
restraints
inevitably
affect
intestate
commerce
and
that
the
kind
of
proof
as
mr.
booker
suggests
is
required
certainly
impossible
to
do
with
lots
of
little
small
transactions.
so
we
look
at
the
entire
context
and
in
that
way,
we
believe
that
we
satisfy
the
commerce
requirements.
my
time
has
been
limited
here
so
i
would
refer
the
court
only
to
my
brief
with
the
issue
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
prospectively
and
as
far
as
the
question
of
mootness
is
concerned.
the
case
is
certainly
not
moot
as
to
the
virginia
state
bar
which
has
to
this
date
insisted
upon
its
right
to
issue
the
ethical
opinions,
to
continue
them
in
force,
it
is
not
withdrawn
them.
it
may
tomorrow
issue
another
updated
fee
report
with
recommendations
to
the
local
bars
or
indeed
promulgate
its
own
fee
report
as
to
which
this
court
should
and
ought
in
this
posture
to
adjudicate
the
lawfulness
of
it.
and
finally,
i
would
just
say
that
with
regard
to
the
position
previously
taken
by
the
justice
department
of
those
letters
appear
in
the
appendix
at
pages
49
to
58
and
indicate
in
that
context
that
the
justice
department
was
primarily
concerned
about
the
commerce
question,
indicating
that
the
practice
of
law
did
not
affect
commerce.
and
for
that
reason,
minimum
fee
schedules
were
not
subject
to
the
sherman
act
not
because
lawyers
were
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
thank
you
very
much.
