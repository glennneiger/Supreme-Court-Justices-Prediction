mr.
lewis
t.
booker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
there
are
five
issues
here
for
this
court's
determination
today.
and
the
very
first
one
is
the
one
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
turned
to,
is
any
interstate
commerce
involved
here
in
the
first
place,
is
there
indeed
any
basis
for
jurisdiction,
was
there
in
the
trial
court
and
is
that
here?
secondly,
is
there
any
exemption
or
exclusion
of
the
practice
of
law
because
of
the
so-called
“learned
professions”
decisions
over
the
years?
third,
is
the
virginia
state
bar
and
the
state
of
virginia
so
intimately
involved
in
the
promulgation
of
advisory
fee
schedules
that
in
fact
the
parker
against
brown
doctrine
is
applicable
to
the
fees
promulgated
even
by
voluntary
local
bar
associations
such
as
the
fairfax
county
bar
association.
fourth
if
advisory
fee
schedules
be
determined
to
be
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
in
fact
should
per
se
treatment
be
accorded
them.
and
finally,
if
the
fourth
circuit
was
wrong
in
its
decision
below
should
any
adverse
decision
by
this
court
be
applied
prospectively
only
or
should
it
be
applied
retroactively?
the
nature
of
this
transaction
is
simplicity
itself.
residents
of
virginia
who
liked
virginia
and
who
wanted
to
purchase
another
home
in
virginia
went
to
reston,
virginia
and
there
purchased
a
home
and
had
the
title
to
that
home
examined
by
a
virginia
attorney,
who
never
left
his
home
county
to
go
from
his
office
to
the
clerk's
office
of
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
to
examine
the
title.
the
transaction
was
closed
in
the
office
of
the
virginia
attorney
in
virginia.
the
money
which
had
to
be
borrowed
to
finance
the
transaction
was
borrowed
from
the
northern
virginia
savings
and
loan
association,
a
savings
and
loan
association
in
virginia
that
has
been
--
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
--
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
if
your
honor
please,
this
money
did
not
move
out
of
virginia.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
the
money
--
it
was
a
savings
and
loan
association
in
arlington,
virginia,
your
honor.
the
money
was
deposited
presumably
by
virginia
residents
who
desired
to
purchase
shares
or
to
make
investments
in
the
virginia
savings
and
loan
association.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
whether
the
flow
of
mortgage
money
is
in
interstate
--
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
we
submit
that
not
in
this
instance
has
certainly
no
showing
that
the
money
which
the
goldfarb's
borrowed
flowed
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
mortgage
money
may
flow
in
interstate
commerce,
but
it
didn't
here
so
far
as
there
is
any
proof.
furthermore,
this
is
not
a
case
involving
mortgage
money.
this
is
a
case
involving
title
examination
and
the
title
examination
was
done
in
virginia
and
nowhere
else.
the
only
contact
the
title
examination
have
with
any
state
was
west
virginia.
let
me
see
whether
i
can
illustrate
that
point
more
clearly.
suppose,
there
are
two
lots
in
reston,
side-by-side.
in
one
of
the
lots,
the
purchaser
has
all
the
money
he
needs.
he
has
always
lived
in
virginia.
he
never
intends
to
live
anywhere
else.
he
works
in
virginia.
he
has
an
attorney
examine
the
title.
his
next-door
neighbor
on
the
other
hand
lives
in
ohio.
he
moves
to
virginia
because
he's
going
to
work
for
the
government
in
washington.
he
borrows
money
from
a
bank
in
maryland.
the
loan
is
guaranteed
by
the
veteran's
administration.
the
price
for
the
property
is
identical.
the
work
required
by
the
title
examiner
is
identical.
what
is
the
title
examiner
to
do
when
he
fixes
his
fee?
one
transaction
has
no
contact
whatever
with
interstate
commerce
on
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
is
the
attorney
in
that
case
to
disregard
the
canons
of
ethics
at
his
peril
and
charge
whatever
he
thinks
is
appropriate
or
must
he
not
consider
the
canons
of
ethics.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
the
canons
of
ethics
prescribe
what
an
attorney
must
consider
in
fixing
the
fee
your
honor.
and
if
he
is
told
--
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
absolutely,
he
could
have
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
if
he
consistently
did
it
for
the
purpose
of
solicitation,
he
could
be
disciplined.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
he
might
or
might
not
be
disciplined,
your
honor.
it
depends
on
the
purpose
of
which
he
was
doing
it.
that
was
evidence
in
the
record
for
example
that
the
minimum
fee
was
not
followed
for
a
number
of
title
examinations
in
reston
because
the
attorneys
doing
those
examinations
were
doing
a
number
of
them
and
could
do
them
economically
at
a
less
charge
than
the
suggested
fee
schedule.
so,
it
would
have
to
depend
on
the
transaction
itself
and
the
attorney
is
told
in
the
introduction
to
the
fee
schedule
that
it
is
only
one
of
the
elements
to
be
considered
and
that
it
is
not
to
be
controlling.
it
is
purely
as
the
canons
of
ethics
say
one
factor
to
be
considered.
so,
where
the
attorney
examines
a
piece
of
land
where
the
title
is
clearly
involved
only
in
virginia,
he
must
at
his
peril
disregard,
we
say
the
canons
of
ethics.
and
yet
the
very
next
lot
which
has
the
kinds
of
insubstantial
context
with
interstate
commerce
described
in
the
record
below
must
at
his
peril
not
consider
the
minimum
fee
schedule
or
consider
the
canons
of
ethics.
for
the
minute
he
begins
to
consider
them
and
setting
his
fee,
the
petitioners
would
contend
he
has
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
we
say
just
as
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
this
is
a
test,
this
is
a
conflict
that
no
attorney
need
be
put
to.
in
this
instance,
there
is
simply
no
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
below
to
indicate
that
the
choice
of
a
home
in
virginia
is
in
anyway
influenced
by
the
cost
of
title
examination.
the
title
examination
is
something
which
one
after
he
decides
upon
the
purchase
then
he's
concerned
about.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
kind
in
the
record
that
title
examinations
in
virginia
are
more
or
less
expensive
and
in
maryland
or
the
district
of
columbia.
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
any
evidence
that
there
is
any
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
counsel
for
the
petitioners
are
very
fairly
conceded
in
their
brief
that
clearly
this
transaction
is
not
in
interstate
commerce.
this
court
spoke
to
the
question
of
interstate
commerce
just
three
months
ago
in
copp
against
gulf.
in
that
case,
which
was
clayton
act
case
and
not
sherman
act
case,
this
court
nevertheless
said
what
we
say
is
very
important
in
this
case
and
i
might
quote
from
the
court.
“even
if
the
clayton
act
were
held
to
the
extent
to
acquisitions
and
sales
having
substantial
effects
on
commerce”
and
that's
a
test
which
must
be
met
here,
“a
court
cannot
presume
that
such
effects
exist.
the
plaintiff
must
allege
and
prove
that
apparently
local
acts
in
fact
have
adverse
consequences
on
interstate
markets
and
the
interstate
flow
of
goods
in
order
to
invoke
federal
antitrust
provisions.”
and
they
are
simply
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
case.
this
is
simply
not
a
case
involving
interstate
commerce.
but
if
--
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
yes
your
honor,
but
that
as
a
conclusion
of
law,
we
submit
in
this
court
as
the
fourth
circuit
has
the
right
to
review
that
and
the
fourth
circuit
did
review
that
and
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
there
were
no
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
no
sir,
we
do
not.
we
say
the
question
is
whether
the
transaction
effects
substantially
interstate
commerce.
has
this
transaction
substantially
affected
interstate
commerce
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
has.
this
is
a
title
examination
at
cost
of
$522.00
on
a
house
which
was
valued
at
over
$50,000.00
and
we
say
that
does
not
show
an
effect
of
any
substantial
nature
on
interstate
commerce.
but
turning
now
from
that
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
learned
profession's
exemption
or
exclusion
from
the
antitrust
laws.
it
is
incorrect,
we
submit,
to
say
that
we
seek
here
today
an
exemption
for
the
practice
of
law
to
the
contrary.
the
practice
of
law
has
never
been
considered
to
be
trade
or
commerce
before.
we
are
not
seeking
an
exemption
here.
we
are
saying
that
the
coverage
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
congress
intended,
the
term
trade
in
commerce
to
mean
and
that
1890
simply
does
not
extent
to
the
learned
professions.
there
are
acts
where
congress
has
carved
out
legislative
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
the
capper-volstead
act
for
example,
trade
associations,
mccarran-ferguson
act,
insurance
where
absent
some
congressional
authority,
commerce,
insurance
clearly
commerce,
agricultural
organizations,
clearly
commerce
were
said
to
be
exempt
because
of
congressional
declaration
from
the
antitrust
laws,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
there
is
no
case
which
has
said
that
law
is
trade
or
commerce
to
the
contrary
everything
the
courts
have
said
and
we
have
called
the
court's
attention
to
each
one
of
those
instances
as
an
average.
over
the
past
80
years
and
perhaps
even
if
we
want
to
go
back
to
the
schooner
nymph
to
1833
has
said
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
trade
and
commerce
and
the
professions.
in
fact,
the
phrases
of
the
sherman
act
in
1890
had
only
the
precedent
of
the
schooner
nymph
before
them
at
that
time.
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
story
very
clearly
said
that
trade
is
one
thing
and
the
learned
professions
and
the
odds
are
another.
so,
if
there
was
anything
which
the
congress
had
in
its
mind
at
that
time
in
1890
it
would've
been
the
decision
in
the
schooner
nymph.
in
that
connection,
it
is
significant,
we
submit,
that
the
department
of
justice
in
1961
and
again
in
1965
when
the
question
of
advisory
fee
schedules
were
put
to
it
by
a
sister
bar
organization
of
the
fairfax
bar
association
said,
“we
regard
this
as
not
falling
within
the
sherman
act.”
why?
because
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply
to
the
practice
of
law,
it's
not
in
commerce,
it's
not
commerce.
that
was
the
department
of
justice's
view
10
years
ago,
15
years
ago,
a
view
which
the
department
of
justice
changed
only
last
year.
the
solicitor
general
has
not
commented
upon
that
change
in
the
department
of
justice's
view,
but
i
submit
that
that
is
persuasive
evidence
that
the
department
of
justice
along
with
the
congress,
along
with
this
court,
along
with
other
courts
which
had
spoken
to
the
issue
had
concluded
that
the
antitrust
laws
in
fact
do
not
apply
to
the
practice
of
law.
but
if
we're
wrong
as
to
that,
should
in
fact
per
se
treatment
be
accorded
to
the
practice
of
law
and
let
me
suggest
another
analogy
and
i
think
this
takes
off
from
what
the
solicitor
general
said.
suppose
there
is
a
town
in
which
there
are
two
businesses
--
a
large
one
and
a
small
one
both
of
these
businesses
are
in
the
process
of
trying
to
develop
a
breakthrough
invention,
a
means
of
turning
solar
energy
into
nuclear
energy.
they're
both
working
on
it
as
hard
as
they
can.
in
order
to
do
that,
they
need
a
particular
kind
of
refractor
which
is
available
only
from
one
company.
the
large
company
goes
to
the
manufacture
or
the
manufacturer
and
says,
“i
want
to
purchase
a
refractor
from
you,
but
i
want
you
to
agree
with
me
that
you
will
not
sell
to
it
my
competitor,
who
was
also
working
on
this
process.”
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
manufacturer
has
a
serious
antitrust
problem
on
his
hands.
but
suppose
there's
only
one
patent
lawyer
in
the
city
and
the
first
manufacturer
goes
to
the
patent
lawyer
and
says,
“i
want
to
apply
for
a
patent
and
here
is
the
background
of
the
patent
and
i
want
you
to
agree
with
me
that
you
will
not
represent
my
competitor
in
a
patent
action.”
is
there
any
antitrust
violation
there?
of
course
not,
the
attorney
there
is
following
the
canons
of
ethics
which
forbid
any
conflict
of
interest.
now
the
solicitor
general
would
suggest
that
some
of
the
canons
of
ethics
are
good
ones
and
some
of
them
are
bad
ones.
i
suspect
the
solicitor
general
would
say,
“i
think
canons
of
ethics
forbidding
conflicts
of
interest
are
good
and
that
we
should
have
them
and
that
we
should
prevent
attorneys
from
having
conflicts
of
interest.”
the
solicitor
general
seems
not
quite
as
certain
as
counsel
for
the
goldfarb's
as
to
whether
advertising
by
attorneys
is
good
or
bad.
both
seem
to
believe
that
minimum
fee
schedules
and
the
recommendation
that
they
be
considered
along
with
many
other
factors
are
bad.
so,
we
see
before
us
three
different
canons
of
ethics
in
the
illustrations
i
have
suggested.
one
involving
a
minimum
fee
schedule,
one
involving
advertising,
and
one
involving
a
conflict
of
interest.
and
some
of
us
would
say
that
they
are
all
proper,
that
the
bar
is
capable
and
responsible
for
self
regulation.
some
would
say
some
are
good
and
some
are
bad,
but
is
that
any
way
for
laws
to
be
enforced?
is
that
anyway
for
an
attorney
to
know
how
to
determine,
how
he
should
perform
his
practice?
we
submit
not,
that
there
is
no
way
that
can
be
selective
or
choice
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
if
indeed
certain
aspects
of
the
practice
of
law
do
involve
interstate
commerce
and
we
assert
they
do
not,
if
indeed,
certain
aspects
of
the
practice
of
law
ought
to
be
regulated
by
some
other
body
then
by
professional
responsibility.
and
we
submit
that
regulation
should
be
made
by
the
congress
and
not
by
the
courts.
by
the
congress
which
has
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
entire
background
of
the
matter
to
determine
what
is
appropriate
under
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
virginia
has
an
antitrust
law.
no
actions
have
been
brought
under
that
antitrust
law
against
advisory
fee
schedule,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
certainly,
the
problem
of
interstate
commerce
is
solved
by
that.
the
state
can
certainly
regulate
in
that
area.
i
would
believe
that
virginia
legislature
could
if
it's
saw
fit
to
enact
such
a
lawyer
your
honor,
yes
sir.
in
fact,
the
state
of
virginia
has
enacted
certain
laws
relating
to
the
practice
of
law
and
it's
a
misdemeanor
in
virginia
for
example
to
solicit
and
if
that's
the
case
and
certainly
the
state
if
it's
saw
fit
after
consideration
would
make
such
a
rule
and
obviously
would
be
subject
to
the
same
type
of
constitutional
review
as
any
other
state
statute,
but
certainly
it's
within
their
power
to
do
so.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
that's
still
very
much
with
this.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
well,
i'm
--
that's
all
i
chimed
in,
your
honor.
i
have
never
quite
understood
the
distinction
either.
turning
to
a
question
as
to
which
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
will
spend
more
time
that
i
today
on
the
question
of
whether
the
parker
against
brown
doctrine
insulates
the
advisory
fee
schedules
of
a
virginia
state
bar
or
of
local
bar
associations
from
the
antitrust
laws.
i
pause
only
to
point
out
in
that
context
that
counsel
for
the
goldfarb's
in
his
opening
argument
has
generally
agreed
with
our
position
and
that
is
that
when
the
state
promulgated
minimum
fee
schedules
in
1962
and
1969
under
the
imprimatur
of
the
virginia
state
bar
which
is
an
administrative
agency
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
then
issued
the
opinions
which
it
did,
it
thereby
did
indeed
sanction
and
direct
state
action
and
as
i
understand
the
argument
for
petitioners
here
today
that
state
action
was
bad
as
to
the
virginia
state
bar
and
so
it's
bad
as
the
local
bar
association.
but
if
this
court
concludes
as
the
court
below
did
that
that
action
is
proper
as
to
the
virginia
state
bar
then
we
say
it
must
follow
that
that
action
was
proper
as
to
the
fairfax
bar
association.
and
in
addition
to
the
promulgation
of
the
two
collections
of
the
minimum
fee
schedules,
the
virginia
state
bar
has
indeed
issued
various
ethical
opinions
considering
minimum
fee
schedules
and
let
me
simply
call
to
the
court's
attention,
opinion
98
which
is
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
a-46.
i
simply
wish
to
read
one
sentence
from
that.
“to
ignore
such
schedules
under
these
circumstances
has
no
ethical
justification
and
deserves
censure.”
these
opinions
are
available
to
and
are
furnished
to
every
member
of
the
virginia
state
bar.
what
is
he
to
do
when
he
reads
that?
is
he
not
to
consider
that?
of
course
it's
not
binding,
of
course
it's
not
the
only
thing
he
will
consider.
there
were
six
considerations
under
the
canons
of
ethics.
there
are
eight
considerations
under
the
code
of
professional
responsibility,
but
it's
one
of
the
things
he
must
consider.
i
would
be
surprised
if
there
is
a
lawyer
within
the
sound
of
my
voice
today
who
has
not
at
one
time
or
another
considered
the
propriety
of
the
ability
of
a
client
to
pay
a
fee
in
establishing
the
proper
fee
to
charge
that
client.
if
a
businessman
were
to
pick
and
choose
among
his
customers
as
to
what
he
would
charge
them,
he
would
pretty
clearly
be
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
would
anyone
suggest
that
an
attorney
who
follows
the
canons
of
ethics
which
say
that
he
should
consider
the
ability
of
the
client
to
pay,
it's
set
forth
right
in
this
opinion.
would
anyone
suggest
that
he
is
there
by
violating
the
antitrust
laws?
of
course
not.
that's
the
nature
of
the
profession,
it's
a
service.
it's
a
service
to
a
society
and
not
a
mere
money-making
occupation
as
a
canons
of
ethics
have
so
frequently
pointed
out.
even
if
none
of
the
protections
which
i
suggest
exist
that
is
that
there
is
no
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
that
the
practice
of
law
is
not
included
within
the
ambit
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
now,
the
parker
against
brown
doctrine
does
indeed
insulate
the
fairfax
association
schedule
from
the
antitrust
laws,
even
if
we
and
the
court
below
were
wrong
on
all
of
those,
we
submit
this
is
not
a
per
se
case.
it
is
not
a
case
in
which
this
court
or
any
court
without
consideration
of
all
the
factors,
without
consideration
of
all
the
professional
responsibilities
can
act.
but
even
if
we're
wrong
about
all
of
that,
we
suggest
that
this
fee,
this
decision
should
not
be
applied
retroactively.
that
attorneys
who
has
the
court
below
said
having
good
faith
followed
the
canons
of
ethics
should
be
punished
in
a
punitive
way
for
that's
what
treble
damage
recovery
is,
it's
punitive
in
nature.
this
court
has
said
it
dozens
of
times
and
indeed
it
is,
why
they
should
be
punished
in
a
financial
way
because
of
their
adherence
to
the
minimum
fee
schedules,
because
of
their
consideration
of
these
advisory
schedules
along
with
all
the
other
test.
this
court
in
the
chevron
decision
set
forth
the
circumstances
under
which
it
would
excuse
retroactive
application
of
the
law.
without
going
in
to
that
case
in
detail,
we
suggest
that
if
this
court
gets
to
that
point
and
we
say
there
is
no
reason
for
it
to
get
to
those
point,
it
should
apply
the
chevron
test
and
decide
that
any
decision
should
be
applied
in
the
future
only.
when
we
get
back
to
the
same
fine
as
we
began,
there
is
no
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
here.
there
is
no
basis
for
this
court
to
say,
“some
canons
of
ethics
are
good
and
some
canons
of
ethics
are
bad
and
we'll
reward
the
attorney
who
follows
the
good
ones
and
we'll
punish
the
attorney
who
follows
the
bad
ones.”
those
are
not
matters
as
to
which
this
court
should
speak.
those
are
matters
as
to
which
congress
is
speaking,
must
be
done,
should
speak.
so,
we
say
in
conclusion
that
the
professional
system
of
self-regulation
of
the
practice
of
law;
the
discipline
and
ethics
of
the
attorney
which
we
suggest
have
furnished
this
country
exceptionally
good
legal
services
over
the
years,
services
which
are
often
provided
free
or
in
minimal
cost
to
those
who
are
unable
to
pay
for
them.
if
this
system
is
to
be
changed
upon
a
plea
of
consumer
interests
and
the
distinctions
between
trades
and
professions
obliterated,
we
suggest
that
that
obliteration
should
not
be
done
by
the
courts,
but
by
the
congress
and
if
it
must
be
done,
it
may
be
the
consumers
who
suffer
the
most.
there
is
no
evidence
to
contrary.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
your
honor,
i
speak
only
for
a
bar
association.
i
speak
in
the
context
of
what
i
understand
the
traditional
professions
to
have
been
at
the
time
mr.
justice
story
has
spoken
1832.
the
professions
of
medicine,
law
and
the
divinity.
i
do
not
speak
for
other
organizations
which
call
themselves
professions,
whether
they
are
or
not
i
do
not
know.
i
do
suggest
that
traditionally
in
england
and
in
the
united
states
and
certainly
at
the
time
mr.
justice
story
spoke
those
where
the
professions.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
there
was.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
it
is
moot
because
the
fairfax
bar
association
has
rescinded
its
schedule.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
in
this
case
if
there
is
to
be
prospective
application
only,
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
in
fact,
there
was
no
suspension
of
the
injunction
below.
when
the
injunction
below
was
entered
on
february
2,
1973
the
bar
association
immediately
send
notice
to
everyone
not
to
consider
the
advisory
fee
schedule
any
longer.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
we
would
suggest
to
that
point
the
case
is
moot
your
honor
because
the
fee
schedule
has
been
rescinded
and
because
if
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
your
honor,
i
hesitate
to
reach
that
point
because
we
say
there
is
no
antitrust
violation
here,
but
assuming
we're
wrong
on
that.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
assuming
we're
wrong
on
that,
we
say
that
the
fact
that
a
practice
which
everyone
regarded
as
a
proper
practice
until
a
suit
was
brought
in
this
case
but
which
has
now
been
discontinued,
was
discontinued
long
before
they
have
been
in
the
definitive
statement
by
this
court
is
moot.
if
this
were
something
which
were
continuing
in
the
future,
that
might
be
different
if
this
court
had
spoken.
but
this
court
had
not
spoken
and
has
not
spoken.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
i
am
your
honor.
that's
my
client
here
today.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
it
may
not
be
and
i
speak
not
to
the
mootness
as
to
the
question
as
to
the
virginia
state
bar.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
if
your
honor
please,
the
fairfax
bar
association
has
long
since
exhausted
all
of
its
resources
and
ability
and
means
to
defend
this
litigation.
when
the
fairfax
bar
association
was
successful
in
the
fourth
circuit,
it
sought
to
avoid
further
expense,
further
threats,
further
uncertainty
as
to
its
members
without
in
any
way
conceding
that
the
adoption
and
the
promulgation
of
the
advisory
fee
schedule
was
illegal
or
wrong
and
the
resolution
reprinted
so
reflects.
the
association
concluded
that
in
order
to
remove
this
uncertainty
and
in
order
it
hoped
to
avoid
the
expense
and
necessity
of
further
litigation,
it
would
rescind
its
advisory
fee
schedules.
mr.
lewis
t.
booker
we
are
not,
your
honor.
