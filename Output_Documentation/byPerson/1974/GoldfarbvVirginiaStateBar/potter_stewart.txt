that
is
by
opinions
of
98
and
170
in
1962
and
1968
and
further
by
being
a
brooding
on
their
presence
that
was
â€“
that
threatened
to
enforce
these
as
--
on
the
basis
of
violation
of
ethics
if
there
were
violations
of
these
minimum
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fee
report
had
to
do
with
the
comparative
study
of
doctors
and
lawyers'
incomes
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
where
there
in
fact
disciplinary
proceedings
initiated
against
people
who
charged
less
than
this
minimum
fee
schedules?
justice
potter
stewart
never?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
never
as
far
as
this
record
this
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
ethical
violation
would
be
soliciting
business,
would
it
be
beyond
that
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
he
undercuts
the
other
lawyer
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
on
the
theory
of
solicitation
of
it,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
just,
if
i
may
before
you
get
into
that,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
previous
point.
you
say
that
there
may
be
a
so-called
learned
profession
exemption,
but
we
need
not
decide
that
here
because
if
the
exemption
exists,
it
has
to
do
with
the
pinch
not
worth
the
squeeze
to
use
justice
jackson's
metaphor
and
that
here
the
pinch
was
on
the
public?
justice
potter
stewart
that
people
in
their
learned
profession
let's
say
you
had
three
or
four
phd's
and
a
couple
of
doctors
or
divinities,
a
divinity
and
maybe
a
dentist
and
an
md,
all
members
of
learned
professions,
but
that
they
could
conspire
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
if
the
effect
of
that
were
on
the
general
public,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
effect
were
wholly
within
divinity
school
or
university
graduate
school,
they
might
be
learned
profession
exemption,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
pure
parker
against
brown.
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
about
an
agreement
not
to
advertise?
justice
potter
stewart
so
do
i
since
i
have
asked
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
may
or
may
not
be
moot
even
if
you're
right
about
the
mootness
to
your
client,
it
may
or
may
not
be
moot
as
to
the
virginia
state
bar?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
good
deal
of
variation
among
the
various
localities
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
attorney
general,
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
virginia
is
there
any
state
law
or
court
regulations
specifically
and
explicitly
regulating
fees
to
be
paid
in
the
administration
of
a
state
--
of
the
decedent's
estate,
do
you
have
probate
courts
or
i'm
sure
you
have
the
equivalent
whatever
you
call
them?
justice
potter
stewart
in
many
states,
there
are
statutes
or
court
rules
which
explicitly
provide
what
the
fee
shall
be
to
counsel
for
the
executor
or
administrator
of
a
decedent's
estate.
does
virginia
have
anything
such
as
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
those,
i
guess
then
are
covered
by
or
the
of
1969
state
bar
report,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
they
are
covered
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
however
attacking
this
minimum
fee
schedule
only
insofar
as
that
is
involves
title
examination,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
they
would
clearly
not
affect
interstate
commerce
at
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
writing
a
local
--
little
old
lady's
will
in
a
small
town
and
right
in
the
middle
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
or
didn't
have
any
out-of-state
property?
