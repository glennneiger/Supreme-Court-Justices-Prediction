mr.
andrew
p.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
andrew
miller.
i'm
attorney
general
of
virginia
and
counsel
for
the
virginia
state
bar.
my
portion
to
the
argument
will
be
devoted
to
a
discussion
of
the
nature
of
the
organization
known
as
the
state
bar.
it's
rule
in
the
activities
which
form
the
basis
for
this
proceeding
and
the
reasons
why
this
rule
constitutes
state
action.
now,
the
state
bar
is
an
administrative
agency
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
created
by
that
court
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
in
1938.
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
promulgated
rules
governing
the
conduct
of
attorneys
and
the
operation
of
the
state
bar
which
are
found
in
part
6
of
the
court's
rules.
the
powers
of
the
state
bar
were
signed
by
the
supreme
court
to
its
counsel
to
which
in
addition
to
certain
elected
members,
six
persons
are
appointed
by
the
court
itself.
now,
there
are
number
of
voluntary
bar
associations
in
the
commonwealth,
both
at
the
local
and
at
the
state
level.
now,
the
state
level,
there
is
the
virginia
bar
association,
the
old
dominion
bar
association,
the
virginia
trial
lawyers
association,
etcetera,
but
each
attorney
pricing
law
in
virginia
is
required
by
statute
and
by
rule
to
be
a
member
of
the
state
bar.
the
state
bar
is
mandated
both
by
the
general
assembly
and
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
investigate
alleged
violations
of
prescribed
standards
of
conduct
and
to
report
its
findings
to
a
court
of
appropriate
jurisdiction
for
any
disciplinary
procedures.
these
investigations
are
carried
out
by
the
district
committees
of
the
state
bar
organized
in
each
of
the
10
congressional
districts
in
the
commonwealth.
pursuant
to
the
code,
the
funds
for
operation
of
the
state
bar
are
appropriated
from
a
special
fund
in
the
state
treasury
by
act
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia.
the
special
fund
in
the
state
treasury
consists
of
fees
paid
by
members
of
the
state
bar.
the
amounts
of
which
are
set
pursuant
to
statute
by
the
supreme
court.
now,
the
general
assembly
has
established
a
ceiling
on
the
setting
of
such
fees.
the
state
bar
has
given
--
been
given
authority
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
issue
advisory
opinions
on
matters
involving
questions
of
ethics.
analysis
of
existing
fee
schedules
of
local
bar
association
by
the
state
bar
involved
questions
of
ethics
in
that
they
may
provide
some
guidance
on
the
subject
of
fairness
of
fees.
now
it
has
been
stipulated
that
the
state
bar
has
been
authorized,
mr.
justice
white,
by
the
supreme
court
to
issue
opinions
such
as
legal
ethics
opinions
98
and
170
which
relate
to
the
significance
of
minimum
fee
schedules
adopted
by
local
bar
associations
and
to
disseminate
studies
on
such
schedules.
now,
i
refer
you
to
stipulation
19.
in
parker
v.
brown,
this
court
stated
that
the
sherman
act
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
restrain
actions
by
the
state,
its
officers
or
agents.
now,
while
the
fact
that
there
is
state
action,
does
not
automatically
confer
antitrust
immunity
upon
a
person
or
corporation.
i
submit
that
the
sherman
act's
sanctions
are
inapplicable
to
a
state
agency
involved
in
such
activity.
and
this
is
true
i
submit
whether
the
state
action
is
mandated
by
command
of
the
legislature
as
in
parker
or
by
the
judiciary,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
raised
the
question
of
inherent
power
earlier
in
this
argument
or
by
both
as
in
this
case.
and
the
conduct
of
the
state
bar
alleged
to
have
contributed
to
a
restrain
of
trade
relates
to
its
role
in
enforcement
of
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
promulgated
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
1970.
now,
pursuant
to,
and
the
supreme
court
made
this
very
clear,
both
the
statute
and
its
inherent
authority,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
organized
the
state
bar
to
act
as
its
administrative
agency
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
and
reporting
violations
of
such
ethical
standards
as
the
court
has
promulgated.
further,
pursuant
to
both
statute
and
inherent
authority,
the
court
has
implemented
specific
disciplinary
procedures
should
violations
to
be
deemed
to
have
occurred.
in
1970,
the
supreme
court
amended
its
rules
by
substituting
a
new
code
of
professional
responsibility
for
the
canons
of
professional
ethics
which
had
been
promulgated
in
1938
at
the
time
that
the
state
bar
was
created.
now,
pursuant
to
this
code,
an
attorney
is
prohibited
from
charging
an
excessive
fee.
in
determining
his
fee,
it
is
provided
that
an
attorney
should
consider
among
seven
other
factors,
the
fee
customarily
charged
in
the
locality
for
similar
legal
services.
it
is
further
stated
that
suggested
fee
schedules
provide
guidance
as
to
what
might
be
considered
reasonable
fees.
and
clearly,
the
state
bar
has
the
duty
provide
attorneys
and
local
bar
associations
with
self-governed
guidelines
by
which
the
reasonableness
of
fees
can
be
judged
and
the
minimum
fee
schedule
reports
circulated
in
1962
and
1969
served
this
purpose.
i
want
to
emphasize
to
the
court
in
response
to
some
previous
questions
from
the
bench
that
the
state
bar
did
not
undertake
to
establish
a
minimum
fee
schedule
for
the
state
as
a
whole.
all
that
these
reports
of
1962
and
1969
addressed
themselves
to
were
an
analysis
of
the
fee
schedules
which
had
in
fact
been
adopted
by
local
bar
associations.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
that
is
exactly
correct
sir.
and
as
a
consequence,
the
reports
showed
that
there
was
a
variation
that
this
was
an
analysis
and
the
results
of
the
analysis
were
submitted
to
the
local
bar
associations
for
their
consideration.
but
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
like
to
point
out
your
honor
that
as
shown
on
page
11
of
our
brief
that
the
minimum
fee
schedule
which
was
adopted
by
the
defendant,
fairfax
county
bar
association
contrary
to
assertions
which
appear
in
the
brief
of
petitioners
did
in
fact
contained
significant
variation
from
the
minimum
fee
report
at
which
the
virginia
state
bar
sent
out
in
1969,
that
is
footnote
4
on
that
page
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
as
far
as
issuing
advisory
opinions?
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
sir
of
course
as
far
as
the
state
bar
is
concerned,
the
state
bar
was
not
found
to
have
then
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
as
a
consequence
the
state
bar
has
proceeded
to
continue
with
respect
to
its
operations
as
mandated
by
the
rules
of
court
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
i
know
no
instance
in
which
an
advisory
opinion
has
been
requested
your
honor
of
the
state
bar
since
this
case
started
with
respect
to
minimum
of
fees.
as
counsel
for
petitioners
indicated
this
morning,
there
has
never
been
a
complaint
to
the
virginia
state
bar
that
in
fact
in
ethical
violation
has
occurred
with
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
i
know
of
no
plans
of
the
virginia
state
bar
to
send
out
another
report
such
as
was
set
out
in
1962
and
1969
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
i
think
that
the
record
reflects
your
honor
that
in
1962
there
were
some
21
minimum
fee
schedules
in
effect
local
associations
of
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
that
was
my
point
of
course
because
there
are
many
more
local
bar
associations
in
21
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
as
far
as
the
state
bar
is
concerned,
it
is
not
required
to
local
bar
associations
adopt
the
minimum
fee
schedule.
that
is
correct.
now
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
excuse
me
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
as
far
as
the
state
bar
is
concerned,
i
don't
think
there
any
question
about
it
sir.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
i
mean
that
in
fact,
the
parker
doctrine
applies
to
the
state
bar.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
as
representing
the
state
bar
sir,
the
suit
is
against
the
state
bar
as
well
as
against
the
local
bar
association.
now,
whether
or
not
a
local
bar
association
adopted
a
minimum
fee
schedule
would
be
a
matter
for
the
local
bar
association
is
determined.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
i
think
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
as
far
as
what
the
state
bar
has
done
in
this
instance
which
is
the
issue
advisory
opinions,
there
are
two
of
them.
that
is
clearly
required
under
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court,
rule
10
as
far
as
circulating
of
the
minimum
fee
schedules
your
honor,
i
think
clearly
the
state
bar
had
a
duty
in
light
of
the
reference
not
only
in
ethical
consideration
2-18
but
disciplinary
rule
2-106
where
references
are
made
to
customary
fees
and
suggested
fee
schedules
to
provide
some
guidance
under
the
mandate
from
the
supreme
court.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
i
think
your
honor
that
this
case
is
complete
different
from
the
asheville
board
of
trade
which
i
assume
you
maybe
referring
to
because
there
was
a
local
association
of
warehousemen
who
said
about
to
restrict
their
prices
and
restrict
selling
space
on
the
floors
of
the
warehouses.
this
is
not
that
case
at
all.
here,
you
have
the
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
i
thought
i
alluded
to
that
point
earlier
in
saying
that
the
state
bar
has
not
promulgated
the
fee
schedule
here
which
is
applicable
to
all
attorneys
in
the
state.
all
that
the
state
bar
has
done
in
this
particular
instance
is
to
provide
analysis
of
existing
local
minimum
fee
schedules.
as
far
as
issuing
their
advisory
opinions
are
concerned,
there
again,
that
was
part
of
the
road
of
the
state
bar
as
the
administrative
agency
of
the
supreme
court.
now,
this
is
entirely
different
from
simply
allowing
individuals
and
the
businessman
whom
you
elude
to,
to
go
out
and
decide
what
they're
going
to
do
on
their
own
because
i
think
you
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
minimum
fee
schedule
in
the
context
of
the
code
of
professional
responsibility.
and
the
minimum
fee
schedule
simply
relates
to
one
of
the
criteria
set
forth
in
disciplinary
rule
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
it
is
not
because
that
has
not
been
authorized
by
the
legislature
or
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
however,
if
in
fact
it
were
authorized
by
the
legislature
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
i
think
it
could.
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
no,
and
it
hasn't
been
done.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
no,
sir.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
that
would
as
again
just
a
report,
it
was
not
a
requirement
that
in
fact
those
fees
to
be
charged.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
i
think,
may
it
please
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
have
as
far
as
the
code
of
the
professional
responsibility
two
concerns.
one,
that
there
not
be
an
excessive
fee
charge
nor
that
solicitation
be
permitted
to
occur.
and
i
think
when
you
have
one
factor
which
may
be
considered
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee,
obviously
any
information
which
impinges
on
that
determination
should
be
made
available
and
that's
precisely
what
the
state
bar
was
attempting
to
do
in
this
instance.
but
it
was
not
requiring
that
such
fee
schedules
be
adopted
locally
and
in
fact
the
majority
of
local
bar
associations
no
such
fee
schedules
were
adopted.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
i
think
dr
2-106
clearly
states
that
a
lawyer
shall
not
enter
into
an
agreement
for
charge
or
collect
an
illegal
or
clearly
excessive
fee.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
you're
talking
about
the
present
case
that
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
all
i'm
trying
to
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
deals
with
both
aspects
excessive
fees
on
the
one
hand
and
solicitation
on
the
other.
and
there's
an
effort
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
sir,
i
think
that
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
alright,
thank
you
sir.
what
the
--
in
the
appendix
at
pages
47
and
48,
opinion
number
170,
the
virginia
state
bar,
what
that
does
is
simply
to
require
a
lawyer
to
produce
evidence
as
such
charges
are
not
made
for
the
purpose
soliciting
business.
now,
if
in
fact,
he
shows
that
he
is
not
using
this
as
an
advertising
device
then
there
is
no
ethical
violation.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
no
sir,
i
don't
--
i
would
not
regard
it
as
a
presumption.
i
would
say
it
was
a
further
of
going
forward
in
terms
of
the
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
well,
sir,
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
i
think
that
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
i'd
enjoy
representing
you
on
some
occasion,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
