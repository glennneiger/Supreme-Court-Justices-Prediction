chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
74-70,
goldfarb
against
virginia
state
bar
and
others.
mr.
morrison,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
whether
any
such
disciplinary
proceedings
have
ever
been
embarked
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
there's
a
general
public
interest
factor
they
call
it
social
interest
in
not
having
system
which
permits
lawyers
to
charge,
let
us
say,
a
straight
$15.00
for
every
title
examination,
$15.00
not
$50.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
gradually
get
most
of
the
or
a
great
deal
of
the
work,
but
for
$15.00,
obviously
performing
shoddy
professional
work
as
it
would
have
to
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
not
be
a
possible
consequence
of
no
standards
for
fees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
minimum
schedules
have
been
disappearing,
have
they
not
over
the
country
as
a
whole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
corporations
got
in
trouble
during
just
that?[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
realize
you
don't
have
very
much
time,
but
are
you
going
to
refer
at
all
to
the
possible
impact
of
this
case
depending
on
its
outcome
on
group
prepaid
legal
services?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
have
few
minutes
before
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
specific
cases
or
in
the
generality
of
their
law
practices?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
the
particular
people
who
are
plaintiffs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
maybe
one
thing
for
a
box
of
matches
and
at
least
some
people
have
thought
in
the
past
including
the
justice
holmes
and
others
that
that
was
perhaps
a
different
thing
when
it
came
to
the
services
of
professional
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
much
evidence
that
that
has
been
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anywhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
a
little
hard
to
communicate
that
without
advertising,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
as
it
passes
by
word
of
mouth
for
the
man's
reputation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
woman's
reputation?[attempt
to
laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
booker,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
simply
by
way
of
a
service
of
the
state
bar
association
to
its
local
components,
is
that
what
you
suggest
about
that
analysis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead
in
your
response.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.

enlarge
your
time
a
little
bit
from
one
minute
to
three
minutes
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen.

case
is
submitted.

the

no
part
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
