mr.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
hoping
that
mr.
morrison
would
talk
for
two
more
minutes,
but
i
should
say
that
we,
the
united
states
supports
the
petitioners
here
and
we
believe
that
these
minimum
fee
schedules
are
in
fact
illegal
per
se
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and
i
hope
to
spend
my
time
primarily
on
the
issues
known
somewhat
inaccurately
as
the
learned
profession
exemption
and
the
state
action
exemption.
it
is
clear
i
think
that
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
applies
to
personal
services
and
it
is
also
clear
that
the
circulation
of
minimum
price
schedules
for
personal
services,
even
without
an
explicit
agreement
to
adhere
them
would
be
a
violation
of
the
per
se
rule
against
price
fixing,
if
the
respondents
here
were
stenographers
or
violinists
or
cosmetologists
or
somebody
else
and
the
question
we
have
is
why
should
not
the
per
se
rule
be
applied
to
lawyers?
the
answer
said
to
be
the
ethical
responsibilities
of
the
bar
and
while
one
may
concede
that
the
bar
has
strong
ethical
responsibilities
and
indeed
the
power
to
police
those
violations
of
their
standards,
one
search
is
in
vain
for
the
connection
between
professional
ethics
and
price
fixing
for
professional
services.
at
least
one
search
is
in
vain
for
a
connection
at
least
to
the
conclusion
that
price
fixing
is
ethical.
the
charging
of
the
fee
is
the
one
place
where
the
lawyer
and
his
client
have
an
inescapable
conflict
of
interest
and
it's
rather
mystifying
why
an
agreement
among
lawyers
to
pit
their
collective
strength
against
the
individual
client
so
that
the
lawyers
may
win
out
in
that
conflict
of
interest
should
be
required
as
a
matter
of
legal
ethics.
mr.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
bork
well,
we
had
hoped
that
mr.
morrison
would,
he
did
not.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
problem
with
interstate
commerce
or
the
effect
upon
interstate
commerce.
mr.
bork
well,
i
don't
think
the
plaintiffs
have
to
affect
interstate
commerce.
it's
the
defendants
that
have
to
affect
interstate
commerce
to
violate
the
sherman
act
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
flow
of
mortgage
money
--
mr.
bork
well,
i
think
in
this
case,
the
effect
upon
the
interstate
commerce
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
particular
fees
being
charged
on
closings
of
the
real
estate.
mr.
bork
the
particular
people
who
are
plaintiffs
are
people
who
purchased
a
home
and
had
somewhat
inflated
cost
with
the
minimum
fee
schedule,
but
it's
not
necessary
that
the
plaintiffs
be
in
interstate
commerce
as
long
as
the
violation
affects
interstate
commerce
and
i
think
under
cases
like
employing
plasterers
case
and
burke
against
ford,
and
so
forth
where
it
is
necessarily
true
that
the
--
and
the
law
infers
it
and
the
law
implies
it
that
the
flow
of
mortgage
money
into
the
state
for
example
will
be
diminished
as
the
price
rises,
that
standard
price
theory
upon
which
the
interest
law
operates.
mr.
bork
a
legal
inference?
mr.
bork
well,
i
think
it
was
first
enunciated
in
the
joint-traffic
case
in
1897
by
mr.
justice
peckham
when
he
said
that
a
restraint
of
trade
was
a
lessening
of
the
flow
of
commerce
which
could
be
inferred
from
a
rise
in
the
price.
mr.
bork
yes,
and
the
employing
plasterers
case
and
the
employing
lathers
case
in
around
chicago
i
believe
the
court
inferred
that
the
flow
of
building
materials
into
the
area
would
be
diminished
as
the
prices
were
raised
artificially
and
that
gives
you
the
necessary
effect
upon
interstate
commerce
i
believe.
i
think
in
fact,
with
these
minimum
fee
schedules
here,
there
would
be
little
difficulty
in
concluding
that
the
sherman
act
per
se
rule
had
been
violated.
indeed,
i
think
any
other
conclusion
would
be
logically
impossible
after,
certainly
after
footnote
59
in
the
socony-vacuum
case.
now,
this
morning
there
was
some
--
there
were
some
questions
i'd
like
to
respond
to
now
if
i
may.
the
chief
justice
asked
the
question,
“what
about
the
bar's
responsibility
with
respect
to
a
lawyer
who
charges
fees
much
too
low
and
therefore
necessarily,
does
shoddy
work?”
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one
is
that
in
sherman
act
terms,
in
other
context,
we
never
allow
price
fixing
on
the
ground
that
the
product
will
be
made
better
if
the
price
is
higher.
we
let
the
quality
and
the
price
both
be
set
by
the
market.
the
second
is
i
think,
that
the
bar
--
mr.
bork
well,
i
think
the
bar
mr.
chief
justice
has
perfect
authority
to
disciple
for
shoddy
work
which
deprives
the
client
of
effective
legal
representation.
that
seems
to
me
different
in
disciplining
for
charging
to
lower
price.
i
have
no
problem
with
the
discipline
for
not
behaving
as
a
professional
man
should
in
giving
the
proper
legal
services.
mr.
bork
i
--
across
the
country
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
bork
--
professional
discipline
is
perhaps
not
been
as
effective
as
it
should
be,
but
i
think
now
we're
discussing
and
in
this
case,
there's
been
discipline
for
cutting
fees.
i
think
we're
discussing
now
conceptually
what
it
is
that
justifies
a
price
fixing
agreement.
i
don't
think
the
fear
of
shoddy
services
or
shoddy
work
and
shoddy
products
under
the
antitrust
laws
does
and
i
think
the
bar
if
it
wishes
to
guard
against
statute,
guard
against
the
provision
of
shoddy
services
rather
than
the
price.
the
second
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
who
asked
if
this
minimum
fee
schedule
did
not
provide
information
to
a
young
lawyer
and
other
lawyers
about
what
prices
were
current.
i'm
sure
it
does,
but
fee
or
price
schedules
have
been
defended
on
that
ground
before
and
that
argument
has
never
succeeded.
you
don't
set
the
price
to
provide
information.
trade
association
cases
indicate
that
if
you
wish
to
provide
information
about
the
range
of
prices
currently
being
charged
in
an
area
you
may,
but
that
is
a
far
different
thing
from
setting
the
price
which
the
man
must
charge.
and
thirdly,
there
was
the
question
about
whether
or
not,
several
questions
about,
whether
or
not
there
had
been
enforcement
by
the
bar
in
disciplining
people
for
charging
low
prices
or
whether
there
was
a
threat
of
it.
the
usual
antitrust
rule
is
that
the
circulation
of
the
price
which
is
to
be
charged
is
sufficient
for
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
there
need
not
be
a
mechanism
or
a
threat
of
compulsion
behind
that.
for
example,
the
nationwide
trailer
system
case
which
i
think
was
part
of
which
was
summarily
affirmed
in
this
court,
holds
that.
i
think
the
real
problem
in
this
case
is
really
the
“slippery
slope”
argument
and
that
is
the
fear
expressed
by
various
bar
associations
that
any
application
of
a
per
se
rule
to
any
practice
of
the
legal
profession
endangers
all
ethical
regulation
of
the
profession
and
i
think
that
fear
is
groundless.
i
think
there
is
room
for
legitimate
regulation
of
professional
behavior.
now,
the
per
se
rule,
there
are
at
least
four
defenses
to
an
attempt
to
apply
it.
i
don't
think
any
of
them
applies
here,
but
any
of
them
may
apply
in
other
cases.
the
first
one
of
course
is
simply
the
defense
that
the
restraint
whatever
it
is
ancillary
to
a
legitimate
join
venture
and
that
kind
of
an
argument
of
course
justifies
restrains
within
a
law
firm,
within
an
economic
unit
to
make
it
more
efficient,
but
as
recognized
ever
since
addyston
pipe
and
steel
when
judge
taft
explicated
that
branch
of
the
antitrust
law,
but
there
is
here
and
no
economic
integration
between
the
entire
bar,
no
joint
venture
to
which
the
restraint
could
be
ancillary.
the
second
defense
is
state
action
within
the
meaning
of
parker
against
brown.
that
defense
is
not
available
here
because
the
fee
schedules
here
were
not
imposed
by
the
virginia
legislature
nor
by
any
state
agency
charged
by
the
legislature
with
the
setting
of
fees.
supreme
courts
--
the
virginia
supreme
court's
minimum
relationship
to
fee
schedules
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
parker
against
brown.
the
court
hasn't
really
proved
or
commanded
these
schedules
and
mere
silence
isn't
enough.
some
affirmative
supervision,
extensive
affirmative
supervision
and
affirmative
state
policy
i
think
are
required
by
parker
against
brown
and
secondly
although
--
mr.
bork
you
mean
in
the
terms
of
state
action
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
bork
i
think
the
--
in
this
case,
i
think
canon
12
says
that
of
the
fact
is
that
it
maybe
considered
are
customary
fees
which
may
not
be
fee
schedules
or
i
think
maybe
the
market
range
of
fees,
but
that
aside,
perhaps
i
can
answer
your
question
best
moving
to
the
case
where
a
state
supreme
court
does
put
out
a
fee
schedule
and
says
abide
by
it
as
a
matter
of
ethics.
i
have
severed
out
that
that
would
be
a
valid
fee
schedule
and
that
the
sherman
act
would
not
apply
to
people
who
followed
it
or
following
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
one
is
that
that
court
although
it
may
have
the
power
to
regulate
ethics
clearly
cannot
call
anything
ethics,
it
wishes
to.
it
could
not
say,
“you
may
not
pay
a
secretary
more
than
$6,000.00
a
year.”
mr.
bork
oh!
well,
i
think
in
that
case
we
get
very
close
to
parker
against
brown
and
if
you
have
a
legislative
of
determination
as
the
supreme
court
as
to
supervise
fees
and
the
supreme
court
does
supervise
fees
then
i
think
we
have
a
real
parker
and
brown
question.
mr.
bork
nothing
close
to
that
at
all.
mr.
bork
oh!
i
think
in
parker
that
depends
upon
the
nature
of
form
of
government.
in
virginia,
we
happened
to
have
the
separation
of
powers
specified
in
the
constitution
much
like
united
states
constitution.
so,
that
i
don't
think
the
problem
arises.
there
maybe
states
where
a
court
has
legislative
authority
and
if
it
does
by
the
state
constitution
have
legislate
authority
then
we
have
a
different
question.
mr.
bork
if
it's
that
fees
but
does
anything
else
that
is
--
mr.
bork
no,
the
state
agency
i
don't
believe
has
set
a
fee
in
this
case.
mr.
bork
uh-huh!
i
quite
agree
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
the
state
policy,
when
a
court
does
it
the
question
must
be
answered
by
reference
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
has
under
state
law,
the
authority
to
do
that.
but
i
want
to
say
that
there
is
--
because
of
time
i
will
move
to
the
last
point
which
answers
the
fears
rather
than
the
--
answer
the
fears
in
this
case
and
that
is
this.
when
the
sherman
act
was
passed,
i
think
nobody
who
framed
it
at
any
idea
that
it
was
going
to
strike
at
the
core
of
the
bar's
ability
to
regulate
itself
as
to
professional
ethical
conduct.
and
therefore,
i
think
it
will
be
quite
wrong
to
strike
at
that
kind
of
self
regulation
and
i
don't
suggest
--
for
example
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
a
bar
association
under
the
sherman
act
has
the
power
to
discipline
a
member
for
supporting
perjury
or
for
converting
a
client's
funds.
maybe
businessmen
couldn't
discipline
their
rivals
in
this
way,
i
think
the
bar
can
for
traditional
and
historical
reasons.
mr.
bork
i
think
the
agreement
not
to
advertise
becomes
between
the
examples
i
just
gave
and
the
straight
price
fixing
which
we
have
here.
mr.
bork
yes.[laughter]
mr.
bork
and
to
say
that
this
is
per
se
illegal,
i
think
it's
not
to
say
that
advertising
is
and
frankly
i
think
the
question
of
the
relationship
of
advertising
where
the
ban
upon
it
to
the
lawyers,
to
the
legal
professions,
professional
and
ethical
obligations
is
a
question
that
would
have
to
be
decided
on
a
full
record.
i
just
don't
know
all
the
functions
that
a
ban
on
advertising
may
serve
in
this
profession
and
i
think
to
decide
this
case
is
not
to
decide
that
case.
mr.
bork
i
believe
so,
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
think
one
can
say
that
lowering
your
price
is
a
method
of
solicitation
and
therefore
unethical.
that
is
merely
to
say
the
price
competition
is
unethical.
one
might
equally
say
that
providing
better
services
for
the
same
price
is
a
way
of
soliciting
business
and
is
therefore
unethical.
i
hope
one
would
not
say
that,
but
one
might
on
the
same
rational.
mr.
bork
well,
i
think
most
i
mean
the
better
services,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
bork
i
think
--
mr.
bork
yes,
it
would
be
but
i
trust
that
--
mr.
bork
by
the
sherman
act
i
certainly
think
it
would
mr.
justice
douglas.
yes,
it
would
and
i
think
and
i
see
no
reason
in
this
context
why
the
lawyer's
participation
on
that
same
process
should
be
governed
differently.
i
think
we
know
enough.
this
court
over
the
years
has
worked
out
the
rules
about
price
fixing
and
there's
no
occasion
here
to
jettison
those
rules
just
because
lawyers
rather
than
cosmetologists
or
somebody
else
are
involved.
to
decide
this
case
i
stress
does
not
decide
other
issues
of
professional
obligation.
so
the
government
asks
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
in
order
to
vindicate
the
sherman
act
and
indeed
i
think
that
would
help
to
vindicate
the
legal
profession.
