justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
in
the
regular
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you're
asserting
that
the
virginia
state
bar
effectively
enforced
the
minimum
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
virginia
state
bar
you're
saying
invited
the
local
bar
associations
to
promulgate
minimum
fees
and
then
enforce
them
through
the
ethical
mandates?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
suggest
that
the
virginia
state
bar
was
acting
outside
the
scope
of
its
authority
under
the
virginia
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
there
isn't
any
clear
authority
in
virginia
law,
you're
saying
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can't
have
it
both
ways,
i
don't
think.
you
can't
say
that
the
state
bar
was
adopting
and
enforcing
fee
schedules
and
then
turn
around
and
say
that
it
wasn't
really
doing
anything
official
as
long
as
you
--
unless
you
say
that
this
wasn't
an
administrative
agency
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
saying
that
it
was
acting
outside
the
clear
scope
of
its
authority
and
so
far
as
fee
schedules
were
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
agreements
not
to
advertise?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
say,
if
it
comes
on
a
per
se,
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
rule,
how
about
agreements
not
to
solicit
otherwise
than
advertising?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
was
a
--
you
would
say
if
there
was
a
specific
state
statute
that
forbade
solicitation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
state
supreme
court
proving
a
ethical
standards
that
indicate
that
ethical
conduct
are
reasonable
fee
as
you
take
in
to
account
of
fee
schedules
as
an
element?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
at
least
you
would
think
the
supreme
court
which
is
an
agency
of
the
state
didn't
disapprove
of
fee
schedule
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
invited
lawyers
to
pay
some
attention
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
statute
said,
“you
may
impose
fee
schedules
if
you
want
it
mr.
supreme
court”
and
supreme
court
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
nothing
close
to
that
here
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
that
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
the
whole
state
agency
here
has
set
the
fee
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
goes
for
solicitation,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
retroactivity
point
goes
only
to
the
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
prayer
for
an
injunction
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
moot
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
so.
do
you
think
that
moots
it
as
an
antitrust
case,
just
secessions
of
an
alleged
illegal
activity?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
we
agree
with
you
on
the
damages,
it
shouldn't
be
prospective
or
retroactive,
would
the
case
be
dismissed
as
moot
or
would
the
--
let's
assume
we
disagree
with
you
on
all
the
antitrust
points?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
not
--
you're
just
speaking
of
fairfax
county
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
if
the
supreme
court
has
not
required
any
local
bar
to
make
up
a
minimum
fee
schedule
or
has
it
required
lawyers
to
follow
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
supreme
court
hasn't
required
local
bars
to
propound
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
i
suppose
if
it
did
require,
fairfax
would
not
have
discontinued
its
fee
schedule
and
certainly
the
state
bar
has
neither
required
nor
suggested
that
local
bars
have
a
minimum
fee
schedules.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
you're
still
suggesting
however
that
there's
enough
official
action
than
the
fee
schedules
to
satisfy
parker?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean,
or
you
mean
it
does
or
it
doesn't?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
hasn't
required
anything
of
the
local
bar
association?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
supreme
court
required
the
state
bar
to
adopt
or
suggest
minimum
fee
schedule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
hasn't,
hasn't
it?
it
hasn't
required
it
to
suggest
these
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
suppose
that
parker
against
brown
is
satisfied
or
the
exemption
that
comes
into
being
if
the
state
simply
passes
a
law
and
says
the
sellers
of
tobacco
in
the
state
may
now
agree
if
they
want
to
on
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
my
question
though
mr.
attorney
general?
the
state
simply
authorizes
a
group
of
business
if
they
want
to
fix
prices?
now,
does
that
bring
into
being
parker
against
brown
exemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
the
supreme
court
simply
authorize
the
state
bars
to
propound
but
didn't
require
it,
if
you
want
to
propound
fees,
go
ahead,
if
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
state
bar
would
be
with
its
authority
if
it
to
put
out
an
order
to
as
an
administrative
agency
of
the
state
which
you
suggested
that
it
is.
if
it
put
out
on
order
to
all
local
bar
associations
to
propound
a
fee
schedule
and
then
said,
“all
lawyers
must
obey
it.”
is
that
within
its
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
thank
you.
