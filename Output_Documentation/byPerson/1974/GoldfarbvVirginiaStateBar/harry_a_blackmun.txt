justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
morrison,
did
the
fairfax
bar
make
any
statement
when
they
withdrew
their
fee
schedule
recently?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
statement
contain
a
justification
for
their
action?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright,
i'll
ask
the
other
side.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
what
i
thought
that
this
problem
lathrop
and
donahue
involved
a
state
supreme
court,
but
did
have
legislative
authority.
they
are
the
creation
of
an
integrated
bar.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
booker,
this
doesn't
bear
on
this
case,
but
i'm
looking
at
the
next
case
down
the
road.
you
have
spoken
of
the
learned
professions
and
would
you
define
that
for
me,
would
it
include
engineers,
would
it
include
registered
nurses
who
these
days
are
unionized
and
chiropractors,
osteopathes,
naturopathes,
and
all
the
other?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
booker,
would
you
give
me
your
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
to
mr.
morrison?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
to
what
is
the
fairfax
bar's
stated
justification
for
the
rescission
of
the
schedule?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
you're
not
charging
a
minimum
fee
schedule?
