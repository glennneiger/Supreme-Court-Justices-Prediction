justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication
in
that
stipulation
or
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
to
whether
this
adherence
came
about
because
of
a
fear
of
disciplinary
action
or
because
of
a
desire
to
persuade
the
client
that
the
fee
had
to
be
charged
on
a
pecuniary
motive
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
color?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
fact
alone
would
support
disciplinary
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
some
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
just
out
of
a
law
school
and
hung
up
your
shingle
and
somebody
comes
to
you
and
asks
for
a
divorce,
how
do
you
know
what
to
charge
him,
if
you
don't
have
some
guidance
from
somewhere?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
one
purpose
of
at
least
a
suggested
minimum
fee
schedule
is
to
kind
of
distill
the
experience
of
other
lawyers
and
say,
this
is
about
what
we
get
for
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
will
be
all
right
for
a
lawyer
to
go
out
and
talk
to
10
other
lawyers
and
see
what
they
were
charging
and
charge
the
same
thing
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
don't
mean
to
entrench
on
your
very
short
time,
but
is
somebody
from
your
side
of
the
elect
is
going
to
discuss
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
these
--
were
these
particular
plaintiffs
no
lender
outside
of
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
that
legal
inference
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
that
same
would
carryover
to
mortgage
money
into
northern
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
judge
bryan's
findings
on
page
9
and
10
of
the
appendix?
he
found
contrary
to
your
contentions,
didn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
test
is
whether
the
defendant's
activities
affect
interstate
commerce
rather
than
whether
the
plaintiff's
activity
was
in
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
the
virginia
legislature
could
provide
by
law
that
minimum
fee
schedules
were
against
the
law
in
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
virginia
legislature
in
its
next
session
were
to
say,
“we
don't
care
whether
the
federal
antitrust
laws
apply
or
not.
we
don't
want
minimum
fee
schedules
for
lawyers
here
in
virginia.”
is
there
any
reason
why
they
couldn't
pass
other
to
that
effect?
