how
did

justice
thurgood
marshall
the
flow
of
mortgage
money
is
not
an
interstate
commerce,
you
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
one
phrase
which
this
court
has
used.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
mean
he
used
the
phrase
disobey
the
canons
of
ethics?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
follow
those
canons
if
it
set
it
at
less
to
this
fee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
follow
the
canons
that
set
the
fee
at
less
than
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
say
if

it,
he
would
be
disciplined?
justice

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
what
is
the
state
bar
done
since
the
injunction
was
issued?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
regard
to
minimum
fees?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
more
suggested
fee
set
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
they
all
showing
that
excessive
charges,
do
have
any
opinions
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
was
that
the
case
that
was
involved?
i
want
to
sure
that
was
the
case,
i
didn't
understand
them.
was
that
in
charged
in
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
that
case
there.
it
seems
to
be
several
things
in
that.
well,
i
can't
hold
you
responsible
for
on
that.
i
just
got
kind
of
confused.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
find
an
excessive
fee
as
being
very
unethical
but
i
have
great
difficulty
in
finding
a
lower
than
minimum
fee
unethical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
to
be
a
presumption,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
violation
of
ethics
when
you
don't
charge
me
as
much
as
you
should?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that's
very
ethical
for
some.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
agree,
don't
you?
