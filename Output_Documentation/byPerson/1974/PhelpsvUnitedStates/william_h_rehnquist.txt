william
h.
rehnquist
the
property
we're
--
talking
about
is
money
in
a
bank
account?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
does
make
some
difference,
doesn't
it
as
to
whether
the
property
is
a
pure
intangible
or
whether
as
you
say
it's
personal
property
subject
to
reduction
the
possession
or
seizure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
they
actually
no
levy
on
a
bank
account
but
force
the
bank
to
turn
over
the
money
to
them
physically
in
the
face
of
an
adverse
claim
by
the
person
who
says,
i
don't
owe
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
had
in
the
possession
of
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
while
it
was
conducting
american
deal
operation,
property
on
consignment
from
the
third
party
which
under
state
law,
the
state
--
the
third
party's
rights
would
prevail
over
the
assignees,
now
would
you
say
that
the
bankruptcy
court
upon
the
--
the
bankruptcy
court
had
summary
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
title
of
that
kind
of
property?
well
i
would
say
that
it
would
but
that
is
a
different
situation
because
here
what
we
have
is
a
tax
lien
which
under
section
67
is
postponed
to
the
costs
of
administration
and
priority
wage
claims.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
property
that's
physically
in
the
possession
of
the
assignee
even
though
he
doesn't
assert
any
ownership
claim
to
it
become
subject
ot
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
--
you
read
section
70
(a)
of
the
act,
that
subsection
8
which
appears
on
page
5
(a)
of
your
brief
where
it
says
property
held
by
an
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
you
read
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
very
broadly
as
not
modifying
property
at
all
so
that
any
property
held
by
an
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
regardless
of
whom
the
property
belongs
to
become
subject
to
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
decided
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
supposing,
i'm
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
of
joe
dokes
who
becomes
the
bankrupt
and
i
have
chair
in
my
house
that
never
belonged
to
joe
dokes,
it's
nonetheless
held
by
me,
is
that
subject
to
the
summary
jurisdiction
in
that
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
possession
by
the
assignee
confers
the
same
sort
of
summary
jurisdiction
on
the
bankruptcy
court
as
possession
by
the
bankrupt
does.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
the
referee
were
to
decide
against
them
as
to
the
perfection
of
their
lien?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
he
filed
a
petition
for
reclamation,
can
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
didn't
quite
get
that
last
mr.
jones,
why
do
you
say
it
affects
the
substantive
rights
as
well?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
consequence
of
what's
going
into
the
jurisdiction
in
the
bankruptcy
court
for
any
kind
of
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
about
the
provision
of
subsection
8
that
section
70
(a)
of
the
act
so
that
equates
the
possession
of
the
assignor
to
the
possession
of
the
bankrupt.
you
don't
have
that
in
your
hypothetical
example.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
modified
by
the
chandler
amendments.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
that
case,
the
case
of
galbraith
against
valley
does
seem
to
say
that
where
the
assignee
holds
adversely
to
the
interest
of
the
general
creditors
there
is
no
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
the
government
says
as
a
matter
of
tax
law,
the
levy
had
proceeded
to
such
a
stage
that
he
was
holding
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
