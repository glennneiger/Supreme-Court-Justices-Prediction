mr.
keith
a.jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
did
not
oppose
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
for
it
was
hope
that
the
case
would
serve
as
a
suitable
vehicle
for
the
resolution
of
the
question
of
substantial
importance
to
the
federal
government's
powers
over
internal
revenue
collection.
that
question
is
whether
the
government's
interest
in
tangible
property
that
had
as
levied
upon
and
tangible
properties
such
as
bank
accounts
is
terminated
or
impaired
by
the
taxpayer
subsequent
bankruptcy.
unfortunately
for
purpose
of
clarity
of
exposition,
that
is
not
the
only
question
that
has
been
raised
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
has
raised
at
least
two
major
subsidiary
issues
that
do
not
relate
to
the
government's
general
power
to
levy
or
its
power
to
rely
upon
the
effectiveness
of
its
tax
levies
or
rather
relate
only
to
the
factual
peculiarities
of
this
particular
case.
and
since
this
is
so,
i
would
like
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
to
focus
the
court's
attention
on
what
we
feel
to
be
the
more
important
issue
in
this
case,
that
is
the
question
of
the
government's
right
to
rely
upon
its
tax
levies
not
withstanding
the
taxpayer
subsequent
bankruptcy
and
then
i
will
at
the
end
of
my
argument
address
the
subsidiary
questions
that
the
petitioner
has
additionally
raised.
i
think
that
the
case
can
be
initially
understood
more
clearly
if
it
is
taken
in
form
of
a
hypothetical
example
that
is
somewhat
less
complicated
than
the
actual
facts
of
this
case.
i
would
post
it
as
that
example,
a
common
situation
where
the
government
levies
upon
a
bank
at
which
the
tax
payer
has
a
bank
account
in
order
to
seize
the
account
of
the
taxpayer.
now,
under
the
internal
revenue
code
and
the
accompanying
regulations
as
our
brief
discusses
at
some
length.
the
service
of
such
a
notice
of
levy
upon
the
bank
imposes
upon
the
bank
in
affirmative
duty
that
is
enforceable
by
personal
liability
to
turn
over
the
entire
amount
of
the
account
to
the
united
states
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
form
of
levy
is
generally
effective
for
internal
revenue
purposes.
i
say
that
is
no
doubt
about
it
because
this
method
of
seizing
intangible
property,
the
method
of
serving
a
notice
to
the
person
that
holds
the
intangible
rights
has
been
used
by
the
government
and
approved
by
this
court
at
least
since
the
civil
war
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
cases
of
miller
against
united
states
at
11
wall.268
which
we
did
not
cite
in
our
brief
by
is
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
to
the
more
recent
cases,
sims
against
united
states
at
359
us
108.
as
to
this
much
of
the
case,
i
take
it
that
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties.
the
petitioner
does
not
contend
that
as
a
general
matter
such
a
levy
would
be
invalid.
where
we
part
company
with
the
petitioner
is
over
the
consequence
to
be
derived
from
the
tax
payer
subsequent
bankruptcy
after
the
levy.
now,
our
view
in
the
hypothetical
example
on
using
the
banks
duty
to
pay
over
the
moneys
to
the
federal
government
is
not
affected
by
the
intervention
of
subsequent
bankruptcy
proceeding,
such
proceeding
should
not
terminate
or
impair
in
any
way.
the
government's
right
to
reduce
that
account
to
its
actual
possession
and
those
right
should
not
be
subject
or
the
rights
and
obligation
to
establish
by
the
levy
should
not
be
affected
by
the
subsequent
bankruptcy
proceeding.
now,
in
taking
this
position,
we
do
not
rely
upon
any
special
preference
for
the
government
or
upon
any
special
exigencies
in
favor
of
federal
tax
collection
although
of
course
we
feel
it
that
should
be
taken
into
account
but
our
reliance
here
is
upon
a
long
established
and
sound
rule
of
bankruptcy
practice
that
this
court
has
applied
on
many
occasions
in
the
past.
that
rule
is
that
a
bankruptcy
court
lack
summary
jurisdiction
over
property
held
by
a
third
party
as
custodian
agent
or
bailee
for
a
third
person
who
is
an
adverse
party
to
the
bankrupted.
the
property
so
held
is
not
subject
to
administration
in
bankruptcy
unless
the
adverse
claimant
so
consents
to
that
administration.
now
compilation
of
--
mr.
keith
a.jones
that's
right.
mr.
keith
a.jones
it's
--
in
a
summary
proceeding,
the
property
would
be
turned
over
without
regard
to
the
validity
of
the
adverse
claimants
claim
and
then
he
would
have
to
rely
upon
his
rights
as
a
creditor
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
keith
a.jones
i
suppose
so
and
by
his
co-counsel
that
he
could
but
in
a
plenary
proceeding,
the
question
turns
exclusively
upon
the
rights
of
the
adverse
claimant
if
he
have
rights
in
the
property
the
it
belongs
to
him
and
is
in
subject
to
administration
of
bankruptcy
at
all
so
that
the
distinction
between
a
summary
proceeding
and
a
plenary
proceeding
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
the
elaborateness
of
the
procedures
but
it
affects
the
substantive
rights
as
well.
mr.
keith
a.jones
well
in
this
case
for
example
in
a
plenary
proceeding,
the
only
issue
before
the
court
would
be
whether
the
government's
levy
was
valid
and
whether
the
tax
payer
owed
a
tax,
if
so
then
the
moneys
would
be
paid
over
to
the
government
in
full.
in
a
summary
proceeding
the
--
i
take
it
that
petitioner's
position
is
the
question
is
whether
those
properties
had
been
the
properties
of
the
tax
payer,
if
so
they
are
turned
over
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
then
the
united
states
only
has
an
interest
as
a
creditor
in
whatever
is
left
after
the
payment
of
expenses
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
keith
a.jones
that's
right.
well
as
i
say,
the
general
rule
upon
which
we
rely
here
is
a
property
held
by
a
third
person
on
behalf
of
an
adverse
claimant
is
not
subject
to
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
and
a
compilation
of
the
cases
applying
this
rule
is
set
forth
at
volume
two,
paragraph
23.06
bracket
1
of
colliers
treaties
on
bankruptcy
and
i
stress
that
paragraph
because
although
we
adverted
to
a
number
of
related
paragraphs
and
colliers,
we
did
not
include
that
one
in
our
brief,
i
repeat
it's
paragraph
23.06
bracket
1.
i
will
discuss
just
two
of
those
cases
here
for
purposes
of
example.
in
taubel
against
fox,
264
u.s.
426,
a
sheriff
had
pursuant
to
a
judgment
levy
seize
the
property
of
a
debtor
and
while
the
sheriff
was
still
holding
the
property,
the
debtor
was
adjudicated
a
bankrupt
and
the
bankruptcy
court
sought
to
require
the
sheriff
to
pay
over
the
property
to
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy,
and
this
court
concluded
that
since
the
property
was
being
held
by
the
sheriff
on
behalf
of
an
adverse
claimant,
that
is
the
judgment
creditor,
it
was
not
subject
to
summary
turnover
instead
the
sheriff
was
free
to
release
the
property
to
the
judgment
creditor.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
page
23
of
our
brief
footnote
10
where
we
mis-discribed
taubel
against
fox
to
our
own
disadvantage.
we
stated
in
that
footnote
that
in
that
case,
taubel
against
fox,
this
court
merely
held
that
property
and
so
forth
and
we
should
have
said
this
court
merely
stated
that
property
in
the
hands
of
a
nonadverse
third
person
who
is
not
holding
a
decision
for
any
adverse
claim
was
subject
to
turnover.
in
face
the
court
in
taubel
went
on
to
hold
that
since
the
sheriff
in
that
case
was
holding
for
an
adverse
claimant
then
the
property
was
not
subject
to
summary
turnover.
the
other
case
of
this
court
that
i
would
mention
was
first
national
bank
against
title
and
trust
company
at
198
u.s.
280
and
in
that
case,
the
third
party
in
possession
was
ware
housemen
who
was
holding
the
property
for
a
third
person
who
was
an
adverse
claimant
to
the
bankrupted
to
whom
the
bankrupt
had
assigned
the
warehouse
receipt
and
once
again,
the
court
held
that
the
property
in
the
warehouse
men's
hands
was
not
subject
to
summary
turnover.
now,
we
believe
that
this
general
rule
annunciated
and
applied
in
these
cases
governs
this
case
as
well.property
held
for
the
united
states
pursuant
to
a
levy
like
property
held
by
other
third
persons
for
other
adverse
claimants
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
bankruptcy
court
summary
turnover
orders
and
a
hypothetical
example
i
propounded,
a
bank
upon
which
the
government
has
served
a
valid
notice
of
levy
holds
the
taxpayer's
account
for
the
government
as
the
government's
agent.
government
as
an
adverse
claimant
is
entitled
to
receive
the
moneys
in
that
account.
the
moneys
in
the
account
like
the
property
sees
by
the
sheriff
in
taubel
against
fox.
it
should
be
payable
to
the
government
as
an
adverse
claimant
and
not
to
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy
for
distribution
and
accordance
with
the
priority
rules
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
keith
a.jones
that's
true,
that's
why
i
used
that
hypothetical
because
i
wanted
the
court's
attention
first
to
be
focused
upon
the
general
case
of
the
government's
levy
and
i
intended
at
a
later
point
to
address
the
special
considerations
that
arise
when
the
person
upon
him,
the
levy
has
been
served
is
a
general
assignee
and
i
hope
to
get
to
that
point
in
a
moment.well,
the
petitioner
here
as
we
understand
it
does
not
challenge
the
general
rule
upon
which
we
rely,
is
not
challenged
the
rule
that
a
third
person
in
custody
for
an
adverse
claimant
is
not
subject
to
summary
turnover.
his
argument
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
simply
the
taxing
authorities
unlike
all
other
similarly
situated
adverse
claimants
are
unable
to
avail
themselves
of
the
benefit
of
this
general
rule.
the
basis
of
this
argument
exclusively
upon
section
67
(c)
3
of
the
bankruptcy
act
but
as
we
read
that
statute,
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
petitioner's
argument
has
confused
the
question
of
inclusion
of
property
into
the
bankrupt
estate
with
that
of
distributing
property
out
of
the
bankrupt
estate.
this
case
is
one
of
inclusion
that
is
the
issue
is
whether
the
property
that
has
been
levied
upon
is
to
be
included
in
the
bankrupt
estate
by
virtue
of
the
bankruptcy
court
summary
turnover
orders.
section
67
(c)
3
does
not
address
that
question
at
all.
it
is
addressed
to
the
separate
and
distinct
question
of
distribution
of
whether
--
of
what
priority
various
claimants
have
to
the
property
that
is
being
distributed
out
of
the
estate.
nothing
in
section
67
(c)
3
was
intended
to
treat
the
government
any
less
favorably
than
other
adverse
claimants
in
constructive
possession
as
we
have
seen
such
claimants
are
entitled
to
reduce
their
property
to
actual
possession
without
any
interference
from
the
bankruptcy
court.
well,
this
are
the
basic
legal
consideration
as
to
the
general
issue
as
we
feel
is
involved
here.
i
think
i
should
also
call
the
court's
attention
however
to
certain
practical
considerations.
it
is
of
great
importance
that
the
united
states
in
its
capacity
as
a
collector
of
taxes
be
able
to
rely
upon
its
notice
of
levy.
if
the
internal
revenue
service
cannot
so
rely,
that
will
be
forced
to
resort
to
more
summary
collection
procedures
and
to
enforce
more
immediate
compliance
with
its
notices
of
levy.
and
this
would
entail
the
use
of
hasty
collection
devices
that
inevitably
will
cause
disruption
would
be
burdensome
and
annoying
to
taxpayers
and
to
the
third
parties
with
whom
they
deal.
we
see
no
social
objective
that
would
be
achieved
by
forcing
the
government
to
scramble
in
this
way
for
actual
possession.
all
the
legitimate
concerns
of
bankruptcy
administration
and
internal
revenue
collection
can
be
served
by
giving
to
the
united
states
the
same
rights
as
are
presently
held
by
all
other
similarly
situated
adverse
claimants.
in
short,
both
for
practical
reasons
of
internal
revenue
collection
and
as
a
matter
of
established
bankruptcy
procedure,
the
government's
levy
should
be
honored
whether
or
not
the
taxpayer
subsequently
becomes
bankrupted.
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
its
valid
pre-bankruptcy
levy
is
placing
the
property
levied
upon
beyond
the
reach
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
now,
this
completes
my
presentation
of
the
government's
position
on
what
we
believe
to
be
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
the
issue
that
the
court
presumably
took
the
case
to
decide
that
as
its
evident,
there
are
other
subsidiary
issues
in
this
case
and
i
now
turn
to
the
consideration
of
those
issues.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
noted,
the
petitioner
contends
that
this
case
was
governed
by
a
special
rule
in
favor
of
general
assignees.
he
contends
that
regardless
of
the
effect
that
a
notice
of
levy
might
have
in
other
circumstances
that
the
property
held
by
a
general
assignee
must
be
turned
over
to
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
levy
and
he
relies
both
upon
section
70
(a)
8
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
also
on
section
2
(a)
21
of
that
act.
that
although
those
provisions
do
state
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
jurisdiction
to
require
assignees
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
to
deliver
the
property
in
their
possession
to
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy,
they
have
never
been
construed
as
running
the
bankruptcy
court
summary
power
to
reach
property
held
by
the
assignee
in
a
manner
adverse
to
the
bankrupted
and
to
the
general
creditors.
the
bankruptcy
court
summary
jurisdiction
under
those
provisions
extends
only
to
the
property
that
the
assignee
was
holding
for
the
exclusive
of
general
creditors
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy.
for
example,
in
galbraith
against
valley
at
256
u.s.
46,
this
court
was
presented
with
the
contention
by
a
receiver
in
bankruptcy
that
property
held
by
an
assignee
adversely
to
the
bankrupt
was
subject
to
summary
turnover.
in
that
case,
the
assignee
had
incurred
certain
expenses
of
administration
applied
to
bankruptcy
and
he
claim
that
he
was
entitled
to
take
the
property
that
--
or
take
property
in
the
value
of
the
amount
of
his
expenses
and
hold
those
for
himself
as
an
adverse
claimant
and
this
court
upheld
the
assignees
contention.
the
court
held
that
as
to
property
with
respect
to
which
the
assignee
had
himself
an
adverse
claim,
that
property
was
not
subject
to
turnover
to
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy
that
it
was
outside
the
bankruptcy
courts
summary
jurisdiction.
mr.
keith
a.jones
section
2
(a)
21
was
enacted
after
the
decision
in
galbraith
valley
but
it
was
generally
considered
as
being
merely
a
codification
of
prior
law
and
collier
and
his
treaties
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief
so
treats
that
enactment
and
i
don't
think
that
anyone
has
construed
as
being
a
general
requirement
that
the
assignee
turnover
the
property
in
his
possession
willingly
without
regard
to
any
adverse
claims
then
i
believe
that
after
the
passage
of
the
chandler
act,
lower
courts,
not
this
court
but
lower
courts
have
had
the
opportunity
to
apply
galbraith
against
valley
to
a
situation
such
as
the
one
involved
here
and
they
have
done
so
to
bar
the
summary
turnover
of
property
held
by
the
assignee
for
his
own
self
or
as
custodian
or
agent
for
a
third
person
from
summary
turnover
to
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
keith
a.jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.jones
that's
also
correct.
mr.
keith
a.jones
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
keith
a.jones
well
any
rights
that
they
had
in
bankruptcy
arose
at
that
time.
it's
correct
of
course
that
they
were
creditors
prior
to
the
--
mr.
keith
a.jones
well,
let
me
distinguish
between
various
kinds
of
rights.
of
course
the
government
had
a
right
to
payment
of
its
taxes
longer
for
--
mr.
keith
a.jones
the
levy
was
served
upon
the
assignee
before
bankruptcy.
one
of
the
petitioner's
arguments
in
this
case
a
second
subsidiary
kind
of
argument
is
that
the
assignee
wasn't
holding
any
property
subject
to
levy.
he
claims
that
the
proceeds
in
the
assignees
hands
were
in
subject
to
levy
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
we
believe
that
contention
is
plainly
wrong.
the
assignee
--
let
me
backtrack.
the
taxpayer
was
holding
a
property
subject
to
the
government's
lien.
when
the
taxpayer
sign
the
property
to
the
assignee,
the
assignee
took
the
property
subject
to
the
lien.
now,
petitioner
concedes
that
much.
mr.
keith
a.jones
there
was
an
assessment
of
taxes
to,
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.jones
it
did.
mr.
keith
a.jones
no
and
that
lien
until
perfected
would
not
have
been
valid
as
against
for
example
a
bona
fide
purchaser.
it
only
became
perfected
when
the
notice
of
lien,
not
the
notice
of
levy
but
the
notice
of
lien
was
properly
filed.
mr.
keith
a.jones
no
that
was
then
--
the
notice
of
levy
was
served
upon
the
assignee.
the
notice
of
lien
was
served
--
was
filed
in
the
appropriate
state
office
but
they
were
both
filed
after
the
assignee
took
possession
of
the
property.
mr.
keith
a.jones
after
he'd
reduced
the
property
to
proceeds,
to
cash,
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.jones
that's
right,
that's
right.
of
course
our
argument
is
that
federal
law
supervenes.
mr.
keith
a.jones
oh,
yes,
you're
talking
about
section
63
31.
mr.
keith
a.jones
yes
it
is
but
one
aspect
to
that
provision
that
the
petitioner
has
consistently
overlooked
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
government's
levy
does
not
reach
only
property
of
the
tax
payer
seemed
to
be
searching
in
vain
for
the
statutory
language.
it's
section
--
section
63
31
(a)
which
is
set
forth
at
page
12
(a)
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
provides
that
if
any
person
liable
to
pay
any
tax
neglects
or
refuses
to
pay
the
same
within
10
days
after
notice
in
demand
shall
be
lawful
for
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
to
collect
such
tax
by
levy
upon
all
property
and
rights
to
property
belonging
to
such
person
or
on
which
there
is
a
lien
provided
in
this
chapter
for
the
payment
of
such
tax
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
government's
lien
in
this
case
be
attached
to
the
proceeds
in
substitution
and
--
mr.
keith
a.jones
well
that's
one
of
the
three
questions
and
i
regard
that
as
a
subsidiary
question.
mr.
keith
a.jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.jones
that
is
an
important
question
and
--
that's
true.
now
in
our
brief,
we
cited
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
shepherd
against
tailor
as
an
example
of
this
court's
application
of
the
federal
common
law
rule
that
a
lien
does
attached
proceeds
and
substitution.
that
is
also
the
rule
under
illinois
law
as
we
cited
number
of
illinois
cases
in
our
brief
that
stand
for
the
proposition
that
when
a
--
an
assignee
under
illinois
law
takes
property
subject
to
a
lien
and
sells
that
property,
the
lien
reattaches
to
the
proceeds.
same
rule
under
both
federal
common
law
and
illinois
common
law.
petitioner
sole
reliance
for
alleged
contrary
authority
is
upon
united
states
against
bess
but
in
that
case,
that
case
holds
at
the
very
most
that
the
government's
lien
will
not
reattach
proceeds
that
were
not
fully
realizable
by
that
--
in
the
taxpayer's
hands.
in
that
case,
the
government
had
a
lien
on
a
taxpayer's
insurance
policy
and
after
the
death
of
the
taxpayer,
the
moneys
face
amount
policy
was
paid
to
the
beneficiary
and
the
government
claim
the
face
amount.
this
court
held
that
as
to
the
proceeds
that
would
have
been
realizable
in
the
taxpayer's
hands,
that
is
the
case
surrender
valued,
the
government's
lien
reattached
as
to
the
proceeds
that
were
not
realizable
in
hands
of
the
taxpayer,
that
is
the
additional
insurance
proceeds
above
and
beyond,
the
cash
surrender
value
lien
would
not
reattached.
now
petitioner
tries
to
fit
himself
within
this
narrow
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
the
lien
that
reattaches
to
proceeds
and
substitution
that
i
frankly
don't
see
how
he
is
able
to
do
that.
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
could
just
as
easily
as
did
the
general
assignee
convert
the
property
into
cash.
taxpayer
could
have
sold
off
the
property,
liquidated
its
receivables
and
receive
cash
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
the
general
assignee.
there
is
no
reason
whatsoever
in
this
case
why
the
taxpayer
--
why
the
government's
lien
should
not
reattach
to
those
proceeds
and
substitution
and
since
we
believe
that
lien
clearly
did
so
reattach
to
those
proceeds.
there
was
property
subject
to
a
lien
on
which
there
was
a
lien
which
under
section
63
31
of
the
code
was
subject
to
levy
and
it
is
clear
that
the
government's
levy
serve
notice
upon
the
assignee
that
not
only
all
property
of
the
taxpayer
but
also
all
property
on
which
there
was
a
federal
tax
lien
was
thereby
seized
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
for
the
payment
of
taxes
and
demand
was
made
upon
the
assignee
for
the
payment
of
those
amounts
to
the
united
states.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
