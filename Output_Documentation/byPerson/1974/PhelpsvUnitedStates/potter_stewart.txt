property
of
the
bankrupted,
formally
of
the
bankrupted
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
assigned
to

but
generally
that
would
property
of
the
bankrupt
still,
would
it
not,
if
he
were
the
only
consignor
rather
than
assignee?
justice

assignor,
i
mean.
if
you
were
a
consignor
rather
than
assignor,
he
would

the
consignor,
he
would
still
have
the
property,
wouldn't

and
it's
not
subject
to
summary

justice
potter
stewart
and
the
notice
of

the
benefit
of
creditors.
justice

the
benefit
of
creditors
who

stewart
yes
but
also
the

talks
about
property
rights
to
property
of
the
tax
payer.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
whole
basis
of
this
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
really
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
the
big
question
that
you
hope
to.
justice
potter
stewart
that
you
did
not
oppose
certiorari
to
be
because
you
hope
the
court
would
decide
that
that
is
more
particularized
question
in
this
case.
