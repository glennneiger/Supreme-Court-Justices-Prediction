justice

well,
it's
perfectly
clear
it
was
a
discern
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
effectively
parallel?
justice
byron
r.
white
united
states
claims
that
ones
it
serves
as
levy,
it
isn't
--
the
assignee
isn't
holding
any
longer
for
the
general
benefit
of
creditors.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
if
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
took
possession
of
a
piece
of
property
that
have
been
mortgaged
by
the
bankrupted
to
his
creditor
in
which
the
bankrupted
claim
some
equity
and
the
mortgagee
then
repossess
the
property,
took
it
from
the
assignee
benefit
of
creditors
and
held
it
under
a
claim
of
right
under
his
right
to
foreclose
that
the
bankruptcy
court
would
have
no
summary
jurisdiction
over
that
property
and
over
the
claim
of
the
secured
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it
was
and
it
had
been
and
was
in
possession
of
the
assignee.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
and
the
united
states
claims
that
the
lien,
the
levy
achieves
that
very
same
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
the
property
away
from
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
levy
made
before
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
levy
wasn't
--
and
the
--
but
--
the
levy
was
made
after
assignment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
who
acquired
--
who
took
possession
to
property
before
bankruptcy
and
sold
it
then
was
subjected
to
a
levy.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
came
bankruptcy
and
any
right
to
the
bankruptcy
act
that
the
assignee
may
have
had
any
rights
to
trustee
or
the
state
against
the
assignee
only
arose
with
the
filing
of
the
bankrupt.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
asserting
any
rights
to
the
united
states
arose
before
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
levy
arose
before
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
there
ever
been
a
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
the
--
could
they
--
who
would
have
gotten
--
who
would
--
would
the
levy
have
been
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
so
when
the
assignee
finally
distributed
and
paid
its
expenses
out
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
here
was
even
if
it
have
to
turn
the
proceeds
over
to
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
should
--
except
to
the
bankruptcy
act,
you
would
say
the
assignee
was
subject
to
he
levy
and
would
have
had
to
turn
the
proceeds
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
they
admit
for
bankruptcy,
you
say
the
government
levy
is
good
and
that
you
would
have
to
turn
it
over
and
that
bankruptcy
had
5538
that
the
assignee
was
not
going
to
take
benefit
solely
5547
