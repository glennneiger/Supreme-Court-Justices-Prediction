justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
74-121
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
a
corporate
taxpayer
unable
to
pay
assessed
federal
taxes
conveyed
its
assets
to
an
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
the
assignee
converted
the
assets
into
cash
to
which
the
federal
tax
lien
attached.
the
united
states
thereupon
served
a
notice
of
levy
upon
the
assignee
demanding
turnover
of
the
proceeds
to
pay
the
tax
and
debtors.
the
taxpayer
then
went
into
bankruptcy
and
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy
obtained
from
the
bankruptcy
court
an
order
upon
the
assignee
directing
the
payment
of
the
proceeds
to
the
receiver.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
order
holding
that
the
bankruptcy
court
was
without
jurisdiction
summarily
to
adjudicate
the
adverse
tax
claim
of
the
united
states
in
that
the
receiver's
only
recourse
to
test
that
claim
was
by
way
of
plenary
action
for
refund
under
section
23
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
we
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit
and
unanimously
affirm.
