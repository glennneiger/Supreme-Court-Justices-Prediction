mr.
dennis
e.quaid
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversing
the
district
court's
order
affirming
the
bankruptcy
court's
finding
that
it
had
summary
jurisdiction
over
the
controversy
before
it
and
adjudicating
that
controversy
in
favor
of
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy
over
the
united
states
and
its
claim
to
a
tax
lien.
the
case
arose
in
the
year
1971
when
the
internal
revenue
service
made
four
assessments
of
taxes
against
chicagoland
ideel
clieners
company,
the
first
in
march
and
the
last
in
june
of
1971.
thereafter,
the
directors
of
the
taxpayer
made
and
a
general
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
on
june
28
of
1971.
nearly
months
later,
the
internal
revenue
service
filed
its
--
or
recorded
its
known
as
a
tax
lien
with
the
recorder
for
--
recorder
of
deeds
of
cook
county
and
on
the
same
day
served
a
notice
of
tax
levy
upon
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
sometime
thereafter,
an
involuntary
petition
for
bankruptcy
was
filed
against
chicagoland
ideel
cliener,
the
company
was
adjudicated,
the
receiver
appointed
and
the
petition
which
initiated
this
proceeding
filed.
the
petitioner
feels
that
the
essential
question
presented
in
this
case
is
the
one
of
jurisdiction,
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
proceed
to
the
merits
of
the
controversy
before
it.
we
feel
that
there
are
three
independent
and
alternative
basis
of
summary
jurisdiction
for
the
bankruptcy
court
in
this
case.
the
first
is
section
2
(a)
subsection
12
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
second
is
section
70
(a)
subsection
8,
also
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
although
slightly
different
that
we
believe
that
they
stand
for
the
same
principle
that
the
bankruptcy
court
enjoys
and
can
exercise
summary
jurisdiction
over
an
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
and
property
in
his
hands.
the
bankruptcy
court
being
of
course
a
cooperage
proceeds
in
rem,
we
believe
that
having
summary
jurisdiction
over
the
assignee
and
the
property
in
the
possession
of
the
assignee.
the
bankruptcy
court
can
go
on
and
to
adjudicate
property
rights
and
interests
in
the
property
which
it
has
gained
summary
jurisdiction
over.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
the
property
initially
started
out
its
tangible
property
being
the
fixtures
and
equipment
of
the
bankrupt,
the
chicagoland
ideel
clieners.
the
assignee
liquidated
by
sale
pursuant
to
a
power
of
sale
contained
within
the
assignment,
that
equipment
and
fixtures,
he
reduced
it
to
cash
and
when
the
levy
was
served
it
was
cash.
but
before
then
and
a
subject
or
during
the
time
when
the
assessments
existed,
it
did
consist
of
tangible
personal
property
and
was
capable
of
physical
seizure
at
that
time.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
the
courts
have
recognized
a
difference
whether
it's
tangible
or
intangible
property,
personal
property
and
we
feel
that
if
the
government
had
acted
to
assert
its
rights
more
promptly
when
it
was
more
tangible
personal
property,
this
would
have
been
an
entirely
different
case.
however
notwithstanding
that
fact,
even
when
it
was
intangible
property,
we
feel
that
the
government
really
never
acted
promptly
to
perfect
its
rights
and
reduce
what
there
was
to
its
possession
and
even
of
its
intangible
property,
cash
in
a
bank
account.
they
can
still
can
compel
the
turnover
of
that
money
to
them
if
they
went
forward
with
their
rights.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well,
i
believe
the
government
is
making
that
claim
in
this
case
that
ones
they
served
their
levy,
they
seem
to
feel
that
they
have
ownership,
not
only
possession
but
actually
ownership
of
this
ones
and
the
power
to
require
anyone
to
turn
it
over
to
them
on
the
pane
of
penalty.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
that
would
be
--
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
true,
yes.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
it's
frozen
until
there's
a
determination
if
there
is
any
contest
of
ownership
or
rights
in
the
property.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes
sir.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
i
think
it
performs
a
different
function
although
it
does
act
to
preserve
of
whatever
rights
the
government
would
have
in
it
and
protect
those
rights.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes
it
is.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes.
the
question
is
one
of
jurisdiction,
who
should
decide,
the
referee
or
a
--
another
court,
the
district
court
in
a
plenary
proceeding
although
the
merits
of
the
controversy
in
a
question
of
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
a
bankruptcy
court
at
least
in
part
enter
into
the
merits,
enter
into
the
determination
of
the
summary
jurisdiction
as
i
think
as
adequately
reviewed
in
the
briefs
on
the
part
of
both
parties
but
what
we're
dealing
with
is
a
case
where
you
have
an
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
who
is
holding
the
fonts.
the
bankruptcy
act
makes
special
provision
and
special
rights
of
the
bankruptcy
representatives
to
that
assignee.
in
section
2
(a)
subparagraph
21,
summary
jurisdiction
are
at
least
jurisdiction
as
given
over
that
representative
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
summary
in
nature
in
order
to
provide
a
prompt
and
expeditious
remedy
for
the
bankruptcy
trustee
to
reach
whatever
property
or
assets
are
in
the
hand
of
the
assignee.
and
also
section
70
(a)
goes
on
to
give
summary
jurisdiction
by
creating
a
theory
or
a
fiction
that
the
assignee
is
a
mere
agent
or
bailee
for
the
purpose
of
the
exercise
of
summary
jurisdiction
to
enable
the
bankruptcy
representative
to
reach
the
property.
the
third
basis
and
the
one
which
is
the
heart
of
this
case
is
whether
there
is
constructive
possession
by
the
bankruptcy
court
supporting
its
summary
jurisdiction.
and
again
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
special
relationship
which
has
been
created
in
the
bankruptcy
act
which
gives
the
bankruptcy
representative
these
powers
to
compel
a
turnover
on
the
part
of
an
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
of
whatever
property
or
assets
he
has
in
his
hand
to
reduce
the
delay
and
the
cause
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
to
simplify
and
ease
their
administration
for
the
benefit
of
all
creditors.
now,
the
united
states
claims
that
they
obtained
constructive
possession
due
to
the
service
of
their
notice
of
levy
upon
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
i
will
contend
that
constructive
possession
in
this
case
due
to
the
nature
of
the
relationship
provided
by
the
bankruptcy
act
over
the
assignee
went
to
the
bankruptcy
court
upon
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
and
that
the
government
would
have
to
show
its
actual
possession
of
the
funds
in
question
or
the
property
before
the
liquidation
in
order
to
defeat
this
one
basis
of
the
court's
summary
jurisdiction.
the
levy
does
not
give
to
the
united
states
actual
possession
of
the
funds.there
are
some
cases
saying
that
it's
a
seizure
of
a
property
interest.
the
case
of
united
states
versus
ivan
that
says
that
is
was
in
a
transfer
of
ownership
of
the
asset
and
that
case
was
a
pure
debt
that
chosen
action
and
there
is
no
tangible
property
involved.
but
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
these
cases
are
not
well
founded
and
that
the
case
in
fact
said
it
in
the
government's
brief
of
in
re
bruister
versus
raymond
corporation
correctly
sets
forth
the
better
rule
that
the
service
of
the
levy
even
upon
a
--
what
the
government
claims
was
their
federal
tax
perfects
the
property
interest
of
the
government
in
the
property.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
in
the
situation
that
you
suggest,
you
have
a
different
situation
where
there
is
no
postponement
provision,
no
subordination
of
the
lien
to
any
of
the
priorities
of
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
i
would
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
of
course
in
a
--
on
a
consignment
situation,
you
would
not
have
a
question
of
a
lien
but
you
would
have
a
question
of
title
residing
in
the
consignor.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
i
don't
believe
he
would
have
title
to
the
property
but
only
have
the
right
to
sell
that
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
consignor,
the
consignee
would
have
that
--
would
not
have
title
to
it.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
right.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
i
believe
that
it
would
become
subject
to
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
but
i
think
that
in
that
case,
the
rights
in
the
third
party
would
probably
prevail
and
be
superior
to
that
of
the
bankruptcy
representative.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
i
think
the
question
is
who
is
the
property
party
or
proper
court
to
decided
these
questions
and
i
think
that
the
bankruptcy
representative
and
the
claim
of
any
party
to
title
or
lien
to
property
in
the
possession
of
--
in
the
possession
of
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
that
someone
who
is
now
bankrupt.
if
there
had
to
be
a
plenary
proceeding
on
every
such
claim
that
a
very
heavy
burden
will
be
cast
upon
the
administration
of
bankruptcy
states.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
what's
the
--
it's
a
different
situation
because
the
bankruptcy
act
creates
special
provisions
for
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
but
if
we've
come
involved
with
the
tax
lien
and
the
levy
at
this
point
where
the
levy
upon
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
bankrupted
would
give
to
the
united
states
greater
rights
and
it
does
upon
a
levy
upon
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
they
claim
that
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
dispute.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
oh,
in
that
case
the
property
would
be
in
the
actual
possession
of
the
mortgagee.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes
but
it
no
longer
is.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
that
is
the
point
that
we
contest
that
it
does
not.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes
it
is.
we
feel
that
the
levy
does
not
transfer
ownership
to
the
government
but
it
merely
perfects
their
rights
to
property
interest
in
the
property
now
in
the
hands
of
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
as
i
mentioned
in
the
case
of
in
re
bruister
versus
raymond
the
--
where
there
was
a
tax
lien
upon
the
bankrupt,
prior
bankruptcy
and
the
levy
upon
a
debtor
of
the
bankrupted,
the
court
held
that
the
property
was
still
subject
to
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
bankruptcy
state.
we
feel
that
this
is
the
better
decision
and
that
it
gives
affect
to
brining
together
the
decision
making
powers
in
the
bankruptcy
court
who
is
the
court
that
is
going
to
administer
the
assets
of
the
bankrupted
in
these
proceedings
and
who
is
a
court
who
is
familiar
with
these
problems
and
we
also
serve
to
protect
costs
of
administration
and
the
priority
wage
claims
that
congress
is
seeking
to
protect.
now
the
government
is
claiming
in
this
case,
availed
it
to
tax
lien
upon
the
property
or
rights
to
property
of
chicagoland
ideel
clieners.
we
do
not
believe
that
they
did
have
availed
it
to
tax
lien
since
the
lien
attaches
to
property
or
a
right
to
property
belonging
to
the
tax
payer
with
the
assignment
by
chicagoland
ideel
cliener
to
the
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
there
was
a
trust
created
for
the
benefit
of
all
creditors.
the
assignor
no
longer
had
any
property
interest
in
the
property
and
that
there
was
a
transformation
of
the
assets
of
the
property
at
that
time
which
deprived
the
tax
lien
of
any
property
or
right
to
property
belonging
to
the
tax
bear
upon
which
it
could
attach.
we
believe
that
this
principle
has
been
recognized
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
bess
where
they
held
that
a
tax
lien
existing
upon
a
tax
payer
did
not
attach
to
the
proceeds
of
his
life
insurance
policy
after
his
debts
do
not
attach
to
the
full
face
value
of
that
policy
but
rather
only
to
the
cash
surrender
value
which
was
a
fund
which
was
being
accumulated
and
held
to
him
and
which
he
could
have
reached.
in
this
case
after
the
assignment,
the
only
interest
remaining
in
chicagoland
ideel
cliener
was
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
an
excess
in
the
value
of
the
property
which
he
had
assigned
over
his
total
indebtedness
and
in
this
case
where
the
government's
tax
lien
is
in
the
sum
of
$141,000.00
and
there's
only
one
claim
against
the
state
and
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
to
bankrupts
property
that
monitors
trust
over
$31,000.00.
there's
obviously
no
revert
or
interest
which
could
have
comeback
to
the
--
comeback
to
the
tax
payer
of
the
assignor
chicagoland
ideel
clieners.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
it
subordinates
him
to
the
cost
of
the
bankruptcy
administration
and
priority
wage
claims.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
no,
not
over
the
creditors.
it
could
not
have
that
effect
because
they
will
be
contrary
to
the
priorities
established
in
the
bankruptcy
act
in
section
64.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
no,
the
united
states
will
be
protected
in
these
proceedings
since
the
--
even
if
they
had
it
no
lien,
they
would
have
a
fourth
priority
preference
under
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act
to
payment.
there
--
the
priorities
ahead
of
them
are
costs
of
administration,
the
priority
wage
claims
and
certain
costs
of
creditors
in
defeating
plans
of
arrangement
and
wager
in
their
plans
and
as
far
as
the
third
priority
is
concerned,
there
are
no
such
claims.
so
the
united
states
will
except
to
the
extent
that
they
are
subject
to
costs
of
administration
and
priority
wage
claims,
both
of
which
exist,
they
will
not
be
subordinated
to
the
claims
of
general
unsecured
creditors
or
put
into
the
same
category
as
those
creditors.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
yes,
they
would
still
enjoy
their
priority
under
section
64
whether
or
not
they
have
a
lien
or
not.
of
course
if
they
do
have
a
lien
and
if
they
are
subordinated
under
section
67,
they
end
up
in
the
same
priority
slot.
turning
to
section
67,
congress
has
expressed
its
concern
over
the
fact
that
tax
claims
are
eating
up
diminishing
the
assets
of
bankruptcy
estates
at
the
current
time
and
for
the
last
several
years.
consequently,
they
have
established
a
provision
subordinating
tax
liens
although
no
other
liens
to
the
first
two
priorities
of
section
64
being
costs
of
administration
and
priority
wage
claims.
this
court
has
held
that
when
the
tax
lien
and
the
words
of
the
statute
is
not
accompanied
by
possession
that
that
possession
is
being
defined
as
actual
possession
in
the
case
of
gorgon
versus
the
department
of
labor
enforcement
of
california.
they
stated
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
give
a
public
warning
to
all
parties,
rights
may
be
affected
by
the
tax
lien
which
is
unknown
to
third
parties
and
is
characterized
as
a
secret
lien
that
if
the
united
states
takes
actual
and
physical
possession
of
the
assets,
third
parties
and
in
particular
general
unsecured
creditors
who
may
extend
further
credit
to
such
a
company
will
be
warned
or
forward
and
can
take
measures
to
protect
themselves
and
sell
which
what
they
can
form
this
relationship.
however
the
united
states
did
not
do
this,
they
served
the
notice
of
levy
and
took
no
further
steps,
instead
they
waited
after
the
assignment
for
the
assignee
to
perform
the
liquidation
of
the
tangible
equipment
and
fixtures
which
were
in
the
hands
of
the
assignee.
therefore
we
feel
that
the
assets
--
i'm
sorry,
that
the
tax
lien
is
subordinated
and
postponed
to
the
first
two
priorities
being
caused
of
administration
and
priority
wage
claims.
we
feel
that
this
court
should
be
guided
by
the
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act
or
the
policy
expressed
by
congress
in
the
bankruptcy
act
that
tax
claims
should
be
subordinated
and
that
there
should
be
something
else
for
other
parties
in
the
bankruptcy
administrations
or
bankruptcy
estates
at
least
to
provide
the
bare
minimalist
being
the
costs
of
administration
and
the
priority
wage
claims
earned
by
wage
earners
within
three
months
preceding
the
initiation
of
the
bankruptcy.
we
feel
that
the
bankruptcy
act
is
a
one
statute
which
deals
with
all
of
these
problems
not
only
with
the
administration
of
an
insolvent
corporations
assets
but
also
with
the
treatment
of
the
tax
liens
or
other
claim
for
taxes
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
we
also
feel
that
this
is
not
an
action
to
restrain
the
collection
of
taxes
since
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
government's
lien
and
levy,
not
taxes
and
that
the
government's
claim
that
this
is
not
appropriate
for
a
summary
proceeding,
is
not
applicable
since
the
case
of
new
hampshire
fire
insurance
company
versus
kan
and
recognized
as
a
--
an
expressed
statutory
exception
to
that
rule,
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
after
the
argument
of
counsel
for
the
united
states,
we'll
have
a
short
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
just
very
briefly
mr.
chief
justice.
the
assignee
was
not
holding
for
adverse
claimants
as
in
the
cases
cited
by
counsel
for
the
government.
he
was
holding
for
the
benefit
of
general
creditors
who
is
not
holding
for
a
particular
creditor
as
was
the
sheriff
in
5327
fox
case
cited
by
the
government.he
was
holding
as
a
state
appointed
receiver
or
representative
of
creditors.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
then
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well,
i
think
it
would
have
become
a
moot
question
because
the
united
states
would
have
had
a
first
priority
under
secition
34
66
of
the
revised
statutes.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
only
its
expenses
--
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
oh
i
think
he
may
have
in
that
situation
to
the
fact
that
bankruptcy
did
not
subsequently
occur
and
alter
the
situation
and
the
relationship
--
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
oh,
i
think
the
important
factor
in
this
case
is
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
policy
that
congress
has
set
forth
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
there,
he
was
holding
in
his
own
personal
sense
adversely.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
well
we
feel
that
tax
laws
wrong
and
inappropriate
in
bankruptcy
situation
where
there
is
another
federal
statute
more
comprehensive
and
which
considers
the
rights
of
all
parties
which
are
involved.
mr.
dennis
e.quaid
but
the
bankruptcy
did
come
and
did
change
the
rights
of
the
respect
of
parties.
i
thank
you
gentleman
for
your
consideration.
