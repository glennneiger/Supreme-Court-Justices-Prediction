well
aren't
we
really
talking
about
place
where
the
merits
of
the
controversy
shall
be
determined
whether
by
the
referee
on
the
one
hand
or
in
a
plenary
proceeding
in
court
on
the
other?
isn't
this
the
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you
then,
did
your
position
that
this
subordinates
the
tax
collector
to
the
general
creditors?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
want
to
get
that
straight
because
as
i
understood
your
argument,
i
thought
you
went
farther
than
that.
