mr.
george
calvin
cochran
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
reply
brief
referred
to
in
part
of
the
presentation
here
gives
rise
to
at
least
one
issue,
which
is
non-constitutional,
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
covered
insofar
in
the
light
of
the
reliance
placed
by
appellant
on
the
curt
flood
case.
the
argument
is
that
this
company
has
relayed
upon
this
court
oppressment,
dahnke-walker,
shafer,
and
what
not.
if
you'll
turn
to
page
92
of
the
record
in
this
case,
the
secretary
of
treasury
of
the
corporation
was
asked
if
they
had
sought
advice
of
counsel
as
whether
or
not
they
should
qualify,
and
the
answer
was
no.
and
the
reliance
by
this
company
on
this
court's
oppressment
is
again
pointed
to
by
the
fact
that
the
dahnke-walker
case
wasn't
spotted
until
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filled
at
mississippi
supreme
court
decide
against
allenberg
cotton
company,
which
brings
up
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
you
have
a
december
the
17
certificate
outstanding
right
now
requesting
that
a
full
certificate
be
secured
from
mississippi
supreme
court
that
federal
question
was
raised
in
adequate
state
ground
on
exist
their
certificates
later.
they
have
not
taken
any
steps
to
comply
with
the
december
17
order.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
not
under
alderson,
footnote
4
in
alderson
indicates
that
a
single
judge
certificate
is
not
sufficient,
and
your
order
of
december
17
--
sir?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yes
sir
it
did.
and
footnote
4
in
alderson
which
you
--
this
court
cites
on
december
the
17
and
sends
back
to
mississippi
supreme
court
for
a
full
court
certificate.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
december
17.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
it
was
never
complied
with.
so
i
--
this
jurisdictional
problem
is
lurking
there
and
my
position
is
that
until
that
december
17
order
is
complied
with
that
is
giving
a
full
certificate
from
mississippi
supreme
court,
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction,
but
various
a
serious
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
two
and
in
a
half
months
later,
you
know
that
probable
jurisdiction
pending
of
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
not
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yes,
a
filing
was
made
reprinting
the
opinion
of
united
states
district
court
case
cone
mills.
and
then
after
that
case
arrived
here,
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted.
now,
dahnke-walker
is
the
major
case
relied
upon
by
opposing
counsel.
well,
dahnke-walker
was
a
case
where
delivered
was
made
on
board
or
railroad
car.
here,
we
have
delivery
to
warehouses
with
the
record
showing
that
these
warehouses
serves
cotton
concentration
points
with
--
at
the
least
25,000
bales
by
this
company
being
stored
in
mississippi
for
an
indeterminate
period.
the
fact
situation
is
right
on
all
force
with
coe
versus
town
of
errol,
and
the
decision
last
term
in
kosydar.
there
are
two
cases,
shaped
of
the
two
cases,
chassaniol
and
federal
compress,
relating
to
the
type
of
business
of
allenberg
has
engaged
in;
one
allowing
taxes
on
the
warehousing
business
and
the
other,
a
license
tax
for
buyers
of
cotton
which
allenberg
cotton
company
is.
the
last
decision
by
this
court,
the
eli
lilly
case
using
taxing
cases
for
determination
whether
or
not
qualification
is
necessary.
the
analogy
follows
that
if
a
company
is
engage
in
taxable
activities,
then,
it
can
be
required
to
qualify.
any
questions?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
talking
about
actual
tax
being
lend
or
a
potential
tax?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
with
respect
to
allenberg,
there
are
cases
showing
that
an
add
vellore
and
property
tax
can
be
apply
as
well
as
a
tax
for
engaging
in
the
business,
your
license
tax.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well
under
eli
lilly,
it
had
to
be
licensing.
eli
lilly
breaks
the
point
at
licensing.
then,
you
get
in
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
no.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
the
shafer
and
lemke
--
that
was
shafer
to
begin
with,
you
have
language
in
that
opinion
that
buying
for
interstate
shipment
is
interstate
commerce.
and
that
is
the
case
relied
upon
appellants.
the
case
has
been
distinguished
and
distinguished
since
it
was
handed
down
by
mr.
justice
vanbebber.
to
me,
it's
a
preemption
case,
the
shafer
is.
today,
it
would
a
preemption
case.
shafer
has
not
been
followed
by
this
court.
chassaniol
involving
cotton
buying
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
no
your
honor,
it
wasn't.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
all
right.
but
in
shafer,
shafer
when
this
court
came
down
with
the
decision
in
chassaniol
relating
to
whether
or
not
you
can
license
cotton
buying,
petition
for
rehearing
was
filled
on
the
basis
of
shafer.
shafer
was
a
distinguished
away
in
parker
versus
brown
purely
on
the
basis
that
immediate
shipment
was
involved
in
shafer,
while
in
parker
versus
brown
in
this
case,
they
don't
have
immediate
shipment.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
no,
i'm
pointing
at
the
record
says
that
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
that
would
do
it.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
they
would
not
have
to
qualify.
they
would
be
in
interstate
commerce
delivering
this
on
board.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
that
was
coe
versus
town
of
errol.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
sure,
well
the
cost
of
our
opinion
points
out
the
mechanical
test
is
a
test
which
this
court
feels
is
determinative,
and
here
we
have
a
delay
prior
the
transit.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well
you
got
richfield
oil
and
the
county
of
merced
case
that
both
indicates
the
same
test
will
be
use
for
import,
export
and
commerce
clause
definition
in
the
coe
versus
errol
situation.
of
course,
coe
versus
errol
was
interstate
commerce
and
import
export.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
i
don't
think
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
the
--
having
an
agent
in
the
state
my
not
be
a
critical
fact.
the
records
replete
with
evidence
that
mr.
cummington
who
is
doing
the
buying
was
acting
on
the
commission
basis
for
allenberg,
but
having
an
agent
to
me
is
not
as
critical
as
the
fact
that
this
company
owns
cotton.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
located
in
mississippi
and
stored
there.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
they're
just
like
a
local
company.
no
difference
between
allenberg
cotton
company.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
they
stand
alike,
and
you
can't
reconcile
with
the
shafer
with
coe
versus
errol,
or
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
kosydar.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
reference
in
the
opinion
has
written
in
such
a
way
that
the
timeline
was
not
critically
important.
the
county
of
merced
case
where
you
got
this
concrete
factory
being
undone,
the
breaking
for
--
there
was
a
time,
some
minority
had
been
shipped
there,
but
it
was
the
fact
that
the
goods
were
at
rest
prior
to
insertion
in
the
foreign
commerce
like
prior
to
insertion
in
the
interstate
commerce
here.
once
that
delay
is
there,
then
the
full
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
tax
comes
into
play
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
involving
interstate
commerce.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
but
richfield
oil
says
the
same
test
will
be
applied
mr.
justice
douglas.
when
you
have
the
schematic
situation
in
the
sense
where
goods
are
setting
and
prior
to
insertion
in
the
same
test.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
realities
of
the
industry?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well
the
reality
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
to
penalize
companies
do
not
qualify
by
not
giving
them
access
to
the
court
systems?
we
don't
have
interstate
commerce
here.
it's
intrastate
state.
these
are
all
activities
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
you
go
down
the
garden
house.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
but
this
is
intrastate
commerce.
this
is
a
contract
between
a
mississippi
farmer
for
delivery
to
a
mississippi
warehouse,
activities
before
interstate
commerce
begins.
a
purely
intrastate
sequence
of
defense
can
be
regulated
in
tax
by
the
state,
and
obviously
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
put
them
on
railroad
cars.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
on
the
railroad
car?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
then
you've
got
cases
which
i've
cited
on
my
brief,
if
they
aren't
loaded
directly
on
the
car,
then
there's
going
to
be
problems.
this
can
be
to
be
taxable
and
it's
going
to
be
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
i
would
say
would
have
to
go
directly
to
the
railroad
carriers
with
no
storage
facility
between
the
time
that
it
leaves
the
field,
the
time
is
placed
on
the
interstate
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yes,
i
take
it.
i'd
put
on
a
common
carrier,
say
a
truck
from
the
field
and
delivered
to
another
common
carrier
and
then
it's
a
straight
through
systematic
and
out
of
the
coe
versus
errol
problem,
not
taxable,
but
cannot
be
regulated
by
the
state
and
purely
interstate
commerce.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
you
can
parallel
that
situation
with
the
situation
where
you
have
goods
in
interstate
transit
and
there's
a
stop,
and
the
cot-mill
transit
test
is
it
for
a
business
purpose.
on
coe
versus
errol
again,
you
got
the
logs
that
were
placed
--
that
where
there
because
water
was
down,
not
taxable.
so
taking
coe
versus
errol
to
your
analysis
that
if
--
it's
just
because
there's
not
enough
trucks
or
something;
coe
versus
errol
not
taxable.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
that
would
be
the
best,
the
only
analysis
i
could
parallel
your
fact
situation
with.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
they
take
title
immediately
upon
placement
in
the
warehouse,
right
at
the
point.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yeah,
the
farmer
has
to
get
those
certificates
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
but
then,
i'm
into
a
part
of
the
case.
i
with
along
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
not
exactly
sure
what
happens
after
the
purchase
has
made.
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
there's
nothing
in
the
record
honestly.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
what
state
interest?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
it's
a
brutal
penalty
but
it
provides
immediate
leverage
to
companies
to
ensure
that
they
will
qualify
and
there
is
a
high
state
interest
in
the
qualification.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
you
can
parallel
the
no
cure
thing
as
to
60
years
for
smoking
marijuana.
does
the
penalty
have
anything
to
do
with
the
malfece
of
issue.
it
is
a
strong
pulley
but
there's
no
constitutional
issue
raised
on.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
the
state
interest
--
they're
qualified
now.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yes.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
if
you
have
a
retroactive
penalty,
what
happen
--
say
that
there
is
a
cure
provision
but
you
can
sue
on
honest
in
deaths,
well
then
what
you
do
is
you
negotiate
with
the
defendant
and
say,
look
--
the
defendant
can't
raise
the
defense
because
as
soon
as
the
company
complies
the
defenses
law,
so
the
state
interest
and
requiring
qualification
is
out
the
window
without
the
type
of
provision
mississippi
has.
so
it
is
a
powerful
weapon
and
it's
been
used
here.
but
still,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
industry
situation
is
with
respect
to
cotton
brokers.
this
is
just
part
of
the
on
going
war
when
the
price
of
cotton
goes
down
other
things
occur.
thank
you.
mr.

lemke
--
that
was
shafer
to
begin
with,
you
have
language
in
that
opinion
that
buying
for
interstate
shipment
is
interstate
commerce.
and
that
is
the
case
relied
upon
appellants.
the
case
has
been
distinguished
and
distinguished
since
it
was
handed
down
by
mr.
justice
vanbebber.
to
me,
it's
a
preemption
case,
the
shafer
is.
today,
it
would
a
preemption
case.
shafer
has
not
been
followed
by
this
court.
chassaniol
involving
cotton
buying
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
no
your
honor,
it
wasn't.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
all
right.
but
in
shafer,
shafer
when
this
court
came
down
with
the
decision
in
chassaniol
relating
to
whether
or
not
you
can
license
cotton
buying,
petition
for
rehearing
was
filled
on
the
basis
of
shafer.
shafer
was
a
distinguished
away
in
parker
versus
brown
purely
on
the
basis
that
immediate
shipment
was
involved
in
shafer,
while
in
parker
versus
brown
in
this
case,
they
don't
have
immediate
shipment.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
no,
i'm
pointing
at
the
record
says
that
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
that
would
do
it.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
they
would
not
have
to
qualify.
they
would
be
in
interstate
commerce
delivering
this
on
board.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
that
was
coe
versus
town
of
errol.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
sure,
well
the
cost
of
our
opinion
points
out
the
mechanical
test
is
a
test
which
this
court
feels
is
determinative,
and
here
we
have
a
delay
prior
the
transit.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well
you
got
richfield
oil
and
the
county
of
merced
case
that
both
indicates
the
same
test
will
be
use
for
import,
export
and
commerce
clause
definition
in
the
coe
versus
errol
situation.
of
course,
coe
versus
errol
was
interstate
commerce
and
import
export.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
i
don't
think
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
the
--
having
an
agent
in
the
state
my
not
be
a
critical
fact.
the
records
replete
with
evidence
that
mr.
cummington
who
is
doing
the
buying
was
acting
on
the
commission
basis
for
allenberg,
but
having
an
agent
to
me
is
not
as
critical
as
the
fact
that
this
company
owns
cotton.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
located
in
mississippi
and
stored
there.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
they're
just
like
a
local
company.
no
difference
between
allenberg
cotton
company.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
they
stand
alike,
and
you
can't
reconcile
with
the
shafer
with
coe
versus
errol,
or
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
kosydar.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
reference
in
the
opinion
has
written
in
such
a
way
that
the
timeline
was
not
critically
important.
the
county
of
merced
case
where
you
got
this
concrete
factory
being
undone,
the
breaking
for
--
there
was
a
time,
some
minority
had
been
shipped
there,
but
it
was
the
fact
that
the
goods
were
at
rest
prior
to
insertion
in
the
foreign
commerce
like
prior
to
insertion
in
the
interstate
commerce
here.
once
that
delay
is
there,
then
the
full
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
tax
comes
into
play
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
involving
interstate
commerce.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
but
richfield
oil
says
the
same
test
will
be
applied
mr.
justice
douglas.
when
you
have
the
schematic
situation
in
the
sense
where
goods
are
setting
and
prior
to
insertion
in
the
same
test.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
realities
of
the
industry?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well
the
reality
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
to
penalize
companies
do
not
qualify
by
not
giving
them
access
to
the
court
systems?
we
don't
have
interstate
commerce
here.
it's
intrastate
state.
these
are
all
activities
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
you
go
down
the
garden
house.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
but
this
is
intrastate
commerce.
this
is
a
contract
between
a
mississippi
farmer
for
delivery
to
a
mississippi
warehouse,
activities
before
interstate
commerce
begins.
a
purely
intrastate
sequence
of
defense
can
be
regulated
in
tax
by
the
state,
and
obviously
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
put
them
on
railroad
cars.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
on
the
railroad
car?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
then
you've
got
cases
which
i've
cited
on
my
brief,
if
they
aren't
loaded
directly
on
the
car,
then
there's
going
to
be
problems.
this
can
be
to
be
taxable
and
it's
going
to
be
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
i
would
say
would
have
to
go
directly
to
the
railroad
carriers
with
no
storage
facility
between
the
time
that
it
leaves
the
field,
the
time
is
placed
on
the
interstate
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yes,
i
take
it.
i'd
put
on
a
common
carrier,
say
a
truck
from
the
field
and
delivered
to
another
common
carrier
and
then
it's
a
straight
through
systematic
and
out
of
the
coe
versus
errol
problem,
not
taxable,
but
cannot
be
regulated
by
the
state
and
purely
interstate
commerce.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
you
can
parallel
that
situation
with
the
situation
where
you
have
goods
in
interstate
transit
and
there's
a
stop,
and
the
cot-mill
transit
test
is
it
for
a
business
purpose.
on
coe
versus
errol
again,
you
got
the
logs
that
were
placed
--
that
where
there
because
water
was
down,
not
taxable.
so
taking
coe
versus
errol
to
your
analysis
that
if
--
it's
just
because
there's
not
enough
trucks
or
something;
coe
versus
errol
not
taxable.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
that
would
be
the
best,
the
only
analysis
i
could
parallel
your
fact
situation
with.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
they
take
title
immediately
upon
placement
in
the
warehouse,
right
at
the
point.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yeah,
the
farmer
has
to
get
those
certificates
--
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
but
then,
i'm
into
a
part
of
the
case.
i
with
along
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
not
exactly
sure
what
happens
after
the
purchase
has
made.
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
there's
nothing
in
the
record
honestly.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
what
state
interest?
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
it's
a
brutal
penalty
but
it
provides
immediate
leverage
to
companies
to
ensure
that
they
will
qualify
and
there
is
a
high
state
interest
in
the
qualification.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
you
can
parallel
the
no
cure
thing
as
to
60
years
for
smoking
marijuana.
does
the
penalty
have
anything
to
do
with
the
malfece
of
issue.
it
is
a
strong
pulley
but
there's
no
constitutional
issue
raised
on.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
well,
the
state
interest
--
they're
qualified
now.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
yes.
mr.
george
calvin
cochran
if
you
have
a
retroactive
penalty,
what
happen
--
say
that
there
is
a
cure
provision
but
you
can
sue
on
honest
in
deaths,
well
then
what
you
do
is
you
negotiate
with
the
defendant
and
say,
look
--
the
defendant
can't
raise
the
defense
because
as
soon
as
the
company
complies
the
defenses
law,
so
the
state
interest
and
requiring
qualification
is
out
the
window
without
the
type
of
provision
mississippi
has.
so
it
is
a
powerful
weapon
and
it's
been
used
here.
but
still,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
industry
situation
is
with
respect
to
cotton
brokers.
this
is
just
part
of
the
on
going
war
when
the
price
of
cotton
goes
down
other
things
occur.
thank
you.
