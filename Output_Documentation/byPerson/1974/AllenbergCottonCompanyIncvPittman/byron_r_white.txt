justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
the
burden
of
qualifying
is
nothing
as
vague
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
a
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
free
traders?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder
if
what
you
really
worried
about
was
not
disqualification,
but
other
burdens
that
this
might
fore
tend,
might
threatened.
did
you
use
like
taxation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
mississippi
designs
a
tax,
put
an
excise
tax
on
cottons
store
in
mississippi,
in
warehouses
in
mississippi,
even
if
it's
owned
by
allenberg?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
they
have
jurisdiction
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
so
you
think
the
tax
cases
and
the
qualification
cases
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
storing
cotton
in
a
state
is
intrastate
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
take
title
to
it,
it's
in
a
warehouse
in
mississippi.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
get
the
warehouse
receipts
and
are
you
saying
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no
substantial
period
of
time
that
the
lapses
between
that
--
could
be
the
warehouse
receipts
to
you
in
the
shipment
are
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
long?
how
long
was
the
cotton
stored
in
mississippi?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
average
length
of
time?
what's
the
average
length
of
time
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
all
we
know
then,
the
cotton
stored
there
in
your
name
for
quite
a
while?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
do
why
do
we
do
invalidate
state
statute
on
some
assumption
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
mean
when
we
get
to.
so
your
answer
to
my
question
awhile
ago
is
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
you
stored
the
cotton
in
--
warehouse
the
cotton
in
mississippi
for
a
long
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
eventhough
--
eventhough
it
was
contemplated
that
allenberg
would
not
take
the
cotton
on
the
state
for
a
long
time,
but
only
when
its
future's
contracts
matured,
even
if
you
were
planning
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you're
wrong
on
that
--
how
about
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
gets
the
benefit
of
that
without
knowing,
the
state
or
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
those
cases,
are
they
when
the
farmers
sold
it,
put
on
a
common
carrier
and
headed
out
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
think
it
might
be
subject
to
a
local
taxation?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
in
accordance
we
put
there,
it
might
be
subject
to
service
or
processing
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
(inaudible)
and
probably
counselor
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
shafer
and
lemke?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
lemke
wasn't
a
preemption
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
trace
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
relying
in
that
here,
there's
no
immediate
shipment?
let's
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
allenberg
--
let's
assume
allenberg
took
delivery
from
the
farmer
by
a
way
of
an
interstate
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it's
just
a
way
of
taking
delivery
at
the
warehouse
and
then
having
it
loaded
on
a
carrier
to
warehouse
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
doesn't
like
the
difference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
you
would
argue
also
that
the
allenberg
has
an
agent
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
supervising
the
execution
of
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
located
in
mississippi?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
on
its
way
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
lemke
and
shafer
say
that
that's
stoppage
and
transit
doesn't
--
and
still
part
of
the
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
take
when
the
warehouse
certificates
should
deliver
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
gets
them,
and
gives
with
allenberg
already.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
the
burden
of
qualifying
is
nothing
as
vague
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
a
lawyer?
justice
byron

white
free

i
wonder

you

but
you
--
so
you
think
the

cases
and
the

cases
are

justice
byron

white
but
you
don't
think
storing

justice

how

how

was
the

justice

what's
