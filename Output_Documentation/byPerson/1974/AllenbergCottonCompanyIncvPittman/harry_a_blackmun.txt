justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
mcquiston,
before
you
sit
down,
let
me
ask
you
question.
they're
too
about
the
tactics.
this
case
strikes
me
as
a
very
precisely
issue
case,
fairly
simple,
and
our
rule
40
readsa
concise
that
there
shall
be
in
the
brief,
a
concise
statement
of
the
case
containing
all
that
is
material
to
the
consideration,
the
questions
presented.
looking
at
your
brief,
there
are
some
30
pages
in
the
statement
of
the
case,
do
you
think
that
complies
with
our
rule?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
are
some
members
of
the
court
to
think
we
have
not
to
do,
you
have
a
106-page
brief
and
the
44-page
reply
brief
and
your
friend
professor
blumstein
has
a
100-page
brief,
its
make
a
250
pages
on
a
single
issue.
i
wonder
whether
the
temptation
is
enough
to
have
your
brief
forgo
reading
when
it's
at
that
great
length.
