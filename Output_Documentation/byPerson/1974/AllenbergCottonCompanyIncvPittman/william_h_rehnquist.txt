mr.
mcquiston,
before
you
get
to
the
harvest
point,
what
control
did
the
contract
give
allenberg
over
pittman's
course
of
cotton
collaboration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
allenberg
either
by
contractor
by
mississippi
law
have
a
lean
at
any
point
on
pittman's
land
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
dahnke,
the
sale
was
fob,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
you
not
have
gone
ahead
and
qualify
it
if
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
decision
have
stood?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
contract
--
i
would
think
you
could
sue
on
contracts
made
after
your
qualification
in
mississippi?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean
as
to
the
future.
i
don't
see
why
would
have
any
grade
impact.
your
contracts
are
annual
ones
aren't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
qualified?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
never
complied
with?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
export
clause
doesn't
necessarily
follow
the
same
guidelines
as
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
of
course,
you
could
make
provision
for
many
of
the
hypotheses
of
the
chief
justice
has
proposed
to
you
by
simply
providing
that
title
passes
or
risk
of
laws
passes
fob,
the
railroad
car
--
the
cotton,
this
particular
cotton
has
been
in
the
state
of
mississippi
for
months.
it's
just
a
question
when
allenberg
takes
title
to
it
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cochran?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
permit
cure
in
the
situation
like
this,
it's
kind
of
like
a
one
bite
type
of
thing.
isn't
that
the
company
can
go
along
without
qualifying
for
a
years
until
finally
it
has
to
bring
the
suit,
then
it
can
qualify
so
that
it
really
never
has
to
qualify
for
practical
purposes
until
it's
actually
involve
in
litigation?
