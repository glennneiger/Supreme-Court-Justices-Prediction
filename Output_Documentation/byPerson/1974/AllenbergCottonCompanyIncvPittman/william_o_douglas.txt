this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
the
appellant
is
a
cotton
merchant
with
the
place
of
business
in
memphis,
tennessee
and
he
purchases
cotton
through
a
broker
in
mississippi
from
people
who
raise
cotton.
and
the
appellee
is
one
who
mannered
into
a
contract
just
with
--
through
the
broker
in
mississippi
to
sell
to
the
cotton
merchants
in
memphis,
tennessee.
and
they
followed
the
contract
and
a
suit
was
brought
by
the
cotton
merchant.
the
appellant
in
the
state
courts
in
mississippi
to
recover
under
the
contract
against
the
farmer,
the
planter.
and
the
mississippi
court
refused
recovery
because
appellant
had
not
received
a
certificate
to
do
business
in
the
state.
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
pattern
of
business
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
court
suffice
to
say
that
we
conclude
since
the
appellant
was
engaged
in
interstate
business
selling
to
cotton
mills
here
and
abroad
and
transact
it
and
then
engaging
in
transactions
on
the
cotton
exchange.
he
was
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
this
regulation
of
mississippi
would
be
a
direct
burden
on
--
upon
commerce.
accordingly
we
reverse
and
remand.
