mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
this
case
involves
is
whether
the
state
of
mississippi
can
require
foreign
corporations
to
obtain
a
license
to
buy
cotton
in
mississippi
and
ship
it
from
the
state.
my
client,
the
allenberg
cotton
company,
buys
cotton
in
the
state
of
mississippi
without
having
any
employees
in
the
state,
without
an
office
in
the
state,
without
owning
any
warehouses
in
the
state,
and
without
even
paying
for
the
cotton
in
the
state.
and
he
buys
that
cotton
for
the
purpose
of
shipping
every
bale
of
cotton
that
he
buys
out
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
allenberg
made
the
contract
that's
involved
here
following
an
industry
pattern
which
has
been
established
over
the
last
100
or
more
years,
like
almost
every
other
cotton
merchant
in
the
sale.
allenberg
bids
for
the
cotton
over
the
telephone
in
a
prior
year,
they
did
this
over
the
telegraph
and
it
submits
those
bids
to
local
cotton
brokers
all
over
the
south
and
makes
contracts
in
that
manner
without
qualification
to
do
business
in
the
various
states
where
bids
are
submitted
and
contracts
are
made.
this
pattern
of
activity
follows
a
pattern
which
has
been
protected
under
the
commerce
clause,
particularly
in
the
agriculture
merchandizing
industry
as
shown
in
the
decisions
of
dahnke-walker
milling
company,
lemke
versus
farmers
grain
company
and
shafer
versus
farmers
grain
company.
all
of
which
established
the
rule
that
making
purchases
to
back
commodities
for
shipment
out
of
a
state
is
an
activity
which
is
exempted
from
state
licensing
and
qualification
requirements
by
the
commerce
clause.
this
principle
was
articulated
recently
by
this
court
in
the
eli
lilly
decision.
in
that
decision,
all
men
of
the
justices
recognized
the
principle
that
commerce
clause
guarantees
free
access
to
all
markets
in
the
united
states
and
that
as
long
as
a
foreign
corporation
limits
it
since
activities
in
a
state
to
those
essential
activities
which
a
necessary
to
transact
business
in
interstate
commerce,
that
corporation
should
be
free
from
local
licensing
of
qualification
requirements.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
eli
lilly
decision
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
lilly.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
i'm
sorry
i
have
a
very
bad
cold.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes,
i
do.
the
principle
we
cite
it
for
is
the
principle
that
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
thank
you.
what
allenberg
did
in
this
case
fits
into
a
very
well
established
industry
pattern
and
in
of
the
pattern
of
existing
law.
in
january
1971,
pittman,
a
substantial
mississippi
cotton
planter
went
to
a
local
cotton
broker
and
i
asked
him
to
get
a
certain
price
for
his
cotton.
the
local
cotton
broker
picked
up
the
phone
and
telephones
the
allenberg
cotton
company
in
memphis.
and
after
some
negotiations
over
the
telephone,
a
contract
was
entered
into
it.
as
is
the
costume
in
the
trade,
allenberg
immediately
might
off
setting
sales
of
cotton
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
and
to
its
mill
customers
outside
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
broker
is
really
a
joint
agent.
the
broker
has
a
clientele
like
all
of
these
brokers
across
the
south.
they
are
the
local
cotton
producers.
they
come
to
him
or
he
may
go
to
them
and
the
broker
puts
the
buyer
and
sell
it
together
and
he's
paid
a
per
bale
commission
which
is
added
to
the
price
of
the
cotton.
sometimes,
it
comes
out
of
the
farmer's
pocket.
sometimes
the
commission
comes
out
of
the
buyer's
pocket
that
in
all
cases,
it's
added
to
the
price
of
cotton.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
title
is
never
in
the
broker's
name.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
he
did
in
prior
years
in
the
particular
year
involved
in
this
case,
he
did
not
buy
any
cotton
for
any
other
company,
but
we
didn't
restrict
him.
he
was
--
it
was
his
own
choice.
he
actually
acted
as
a
merchant
himself.
he
was
buying
cotton
for
his
own
account
during
that
year
and
acting
--
it
running
his
own
little
small
cotton
merchandizing
business.
and
on
the
side,
he
was
contracting
cotton
for
allenberg.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
he
acted
for
a
number
of
different
farmers
in
that
year.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
only
for
us,
but
that
was
his
own
choice.
it
was
just
a
coincidence.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we
have
no
control
of
what
he
did
and
did
not
act
of
the
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
in
the
commission
here
was
added
to
the
invoice
price
of
the
cotton
and
allenberg
paid
the
full
price
of
the
cotton
including
the
broker's
commission.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
fully
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
farmer
abated?
yes,
your
honor.
in
some
cases
where
the
farmer
invoices
his
cotton
directly
to
the
merchant
himself
by
attaching
his
negotiable
warehouse
for
seeks
to
a
draft
and
forwarding
in
directly
to
the
buyer's
bank,
he
may
receive
the
cash
and
have
to
go
to
the
broker
and
pay
him
his
commission.
in
this
case,
the
transaction
was
handled
through
the
broker's
office
and
so
what
the
broker
did
was
he
advance
his
own
money
to
the
farmer
and
then
attached
the
negotiable
warehouse
receipts
to
a
draft
and
drew
on
allenberg's
bank
in
memphis,
and
that
draft
included
his
commission.
under
this
contract
that
pittman
and
allenberg
made,
pittman
was
obligated
to
follow
the
normal
industry
practice
of
warehousing
his
cotton
after
it
was
harvested.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
contract
specifies
that
he
would
follow
normal
good
forming
methods.
it's
a
contractual
farmers'
that
he
didn't
--
if
he
didn't
leave
up
to,
he
would
be
subject
to
breach
of
contract
suit.
the
only
actual
controlled
that
allenberg
had
over,
but
they
had
no
control
over
his
farming
methods
except
insofar
as
he
was
obligated
to
use
normal
good
farming
methods.
if
the
ginning
process,
some
farmers
from
time
to
time
have
taken
wet
cotton
and
ginned
it
at
a
two
high,
a
temperature
went
ruin
the
cotton,
and
so
the
contract
specifies
that
the
buyer
will
have
the
option
to
control
the
ginning
temperature.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
on
the
going
crop
--
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
contract
was
made
in
january
before
pittman
ever
planted
a
single
seed.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
planning
is
the
spring
in
april.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
and
then
the
harvest
would
be
september,
october
anywhere
from
--
it
begins
at
the
point
depending
on
the
weather
and
end
as
late
of
march
--
i
mean
sorry,
as
late
as
december,
january.
if
weather
is
wet
last
year,
we
didn't
get
cotton
out
of
the
fields
until
march.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
it
was
for
all
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
--
they
produced
on
a
700
acres
of
land.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
whatever
was
produced.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
at
so
much
depending
on
the
quality
of
the
cotton.
they're
had
so
much
a
bale.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
there
were
several
grades.
now,
the
--
when
the
--
after
the
cotton
is
put
in
the
warehouse,
a
sample
is
cut
from
the
cottons
and
sent
to
the
department
of
agriculture.
the
us
department
of
agriculture
grades
the
cotton
and
since
they
are
independent,
that's
used
to
determine
how
much
the
farmers
paid
for
his
cotton.
another
sample
is
cut
from
the
bale
of
cotton
and
is
mailed
by
the
farmer
to
memphis.
now,
once
the
cotton
merchant
has
the
sample
in
memphis
and
the
negotiable
warehouse
receipt,
he
uses
those
samples
to
make
up
shipping
lots.
now,
the
ultimate
consumer
of
cotton
is
cotton
mills
and
they
use
it
in
--
traditionally
100-bale
lots.
each
bale
in
a
100-bale
lot
has
to
match
that
another
99
bales
in
grade,
staple
and
color.
otherwise,
it's
just
not
useable.
now,
the
cotton
does
not
come
out
of
the
fields
in
100-bale
even-running
lots.
one
of
the
primary
functions
of
the
merchant
performs
is
grouping
the
cotton
together
in
the
even-running
lots.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
cotton
merchant
in
memphis,
allenberg.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
it
perceives
the
samples
in
memphis,
uses
them
to
make
up
100-bale
shipping
lots
of
even-running
cottons.
it's
all
the
same.
and
at
that
point
and
not
before
then,
is
anybody
in
the
industry
able
to
determine
where
that
cotton
is
to
be
going?
it
can't
be
taken
from
the
fields
and
put
on
railroad
cars.
it
has
to
go
into
the
warehouse,
a
sample
has
to
be
cut,
group
with
another
like
bales,
and
then
shipping
orders
issued.
the
shipping
orders
are
issued
from
memphis
and
they're
a
long
list
of
the
bales
by
number.
each
bale
is
treated
individually
and
the
warehouseman
takes
the
list
and
mechanically
pulls
the
bales
out
and
puts
them
on
the
railroad
car
down
from
north
carolina
to
port
of
new
orleans
web.
the
point
of
that
is
that
the
cotton
cannot
move
out
of
the
state
of
mississippi
until
it's
been
warehoused
and
classified
in
the
manner
that's
--
that
allenberg
does
in
this
case.
now
on
the
existing
law,
the
activities
that
allenberg
performed
in
this
case
who
making
this
contract
as
a
commodities
merchant
are
recognized
as
essential
and
integral
parts
of
the
national
commodities
merchandising
system
and
of
interstate
commerce.
the
commodities
exchange
act,
7
u.s.c
section
3
states
that
a
transaction
in
respect
to
cotton
shall
be
considered
to
be
an
interstate
commerce,
if
the
transaction
is
a
part
of
the
current
of
commerce
usual
in
the
commodity's
trade
including
all
cases
where
the
purchase
is
for
shipment
out
of
the
state.
the
commodities
exchange
act
follows
the
definition
of
commerce,
interstate
commerce
which
was
established
in
the
leading
agriculture
marketing
cases
of
dahnke-walker
milling
company,
shafer
versus
farmers
grain,
lemke
versus
farmers
grain.
this
case
that's
before
the
court
today
is
stronger
than
those
cases.
in
shafer
and
lemke,
the
supreme
court
held
that
purchases
to
buy
wheat
were
made
in
interstate
commerce
and
not
subject
to
local
licensing
of
qualification
requirements,
eventhough
the
buyers
in
those
cases
were
located
in
the
state
had
employees
in
the
state,
offices
in
the
state,
paid
for
the
wheat
and
the
state
received
delivery
of
the
wheat
in
the
state,
and
eventhough
in
local
grain
elevators
in
the
state.
and
in
the
dahnke
case,
the
contract
between
the
selling
farmer
and
wheat
purchaser
in
that
case
was
held
to
be
an
interstate
commerce,
eventhough
the
farmer
did
not
know
he
was
making
a
contract
within
out
of
state
company.
and
in
here,
mr.
pittman
knew
from
the
beginning
that
he
was
making
a
contract
with
allenberg
cotton
company,
a
tennessee
corporation.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
sale
was
fob
course
in
dahnke,
but
the
sale
in
the
shafer
and
lemke
cases
was
delivery
at
the
grain
elevators
which
served
the
same
function
in
the
wheat
industry
that
the
cotton
warehouse
is
doing
in
car
industry.
allenberg's
purchased
--
well,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
also
strong
within
this
wheat
cases
because
in
the
wheat
cases,
they
said
it's
approximately
90%
of
the
wheat
left
the
state
of
south
dakota.
the
10%
was
use
locally
in
mississippi.
every
bale
of
cotton
or
virtually
ever
bale
that's
produced
in
the
state
is
shipped
from
the
state.
there
is
just
no
significant
amount
of
milling
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
cotton
is
one
of
the
nation's
most
important
exports.
in
1973,
there
was
seven
million
bales
of
cotton
exported
by
companies
just
like
my
client.
out
of
a
total
us
cotton
crop
of
12
millions
bales,
that
12
million
bales
in
1973
of
that
12
million
bales,
1.8
million
bales
were
raised
in
mississippi
alone.
and
in
1973,
the
time
this
decision
was
rendered
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
one
million
bales
of
cotton
in
the
state
of
mississippi
were
under
forward
contracts
identical
to
the
one
before
the
court
in
this
case.
for
this
reason,
the
decision
on
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
this
case
hit
our
industry
like
a
bombshell.
in
1973,
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
had
mounted
an
intensive
campaign
to
convince
everybody
in
the
cotton
industry
to
enter
into
forward
contracts.
that
is
contracts
that
are
made
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
for
the
farmer
producers
of
plants
this
cotton.
this
campaign
was
so
successful
in
1973.
the
three
out
of
every
four
bales
of
cotton
raised
in
the
country
was
subject
to
contracts
like
this
one
in
this
case.
the
decision
in
this
case
which
held
in
the
middle
of
the
year
that
a
foreign
cotton
buyer
could
not
enforce
his
contract
in
the
mississippi
court,
literally
threatened
to
ruin
our
entire
industry.
if
this
decision
has
stood
in
just
mississippi
alone
which
it
did
not,
thanks
to
the
innovation
of
the
federal
district
courts
there.
a
large
part
of
our
industry
would
have
been
destroyed
and
i
believe
the
entire
nation
would
have
suffered.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we
did
qualify
immediately
thereafter,
but
under
the
decision
below,
subsequent
qualification
does
not
cure
the
defects.
you
can
never
sue
on
a
contract
made
in
mississippi.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
we
could,
but
this
in
1973
where
made
before
this
decision
was
announced.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
it
has
an
impact
in
this
manner
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
under
present
mississippi
law
with
this
no
cure
or
statute,
there's
a
market
barrier
raised
around
the
boarders
of
the
state.
a
cotton
company
that's
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
mississippi
cannot
mail
even
submit
a
bid
to
buy
cotton
there.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we
have,
yes.
and
companies
that
--
large
companies
of
course
will
qualify
and
establish
themselves
in
the
markets,
but
they
won't
be
the
free
competition.
they
won't
--
a
farmer
in
mr.
pittman's
position
today
can't
pick
up
the
phone
and
shop
his
cotton
with
any
cotton
merchant
in
the
country.
he's
limited
to
those
who
previously
qualified
to
do
business
from
mississippi.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
burden
is
a
--
these
are
small
companies
mr.
justice
white
and
they
are
500
to
a
thousand
of
them
and
the
administrative
cost
in
our
industry
are
very
significant
factor
in
determining
what
areas
of
competition
we
operate
in.
the
essential
tools
of
the
cotton
merchant
are
desk
and
a
telephone
in
a
good
bank
line
of
credit.
and
we
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
and
not
a
lawyer.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
because
the
allenberg
cotton
company
is
a
matter
of
fact
is
headed
by
yale
lawyer.
these
companies
are
not
qualify
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
a
free
trader,
absolutely
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
dahnke-walker
case
and
lemke
and
shafer.
this
administrative
cost
i
know
when
after
this
decision,
we
have
to
qualify
allenberg
in
every
state.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we're
not
worried
about
it
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
be
happy
to
pay
whatever
mississippi
taxes
were
due
because

that
would

mr.

yes.
mr.
john

they
have

mr.

yes,
sir.
we
supposedly

common
market
in
this
country
and

mr.
john
mcquiston,

we
don't
store
the

there
your
honor.

places

there

mr.

that's
exactly
right;

mr.
john

there's
a

mr.

not
in

to
the

practice.
it's
a
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
cotton
crop
begins
to
come
in,
in
september
and
october,
and
as
soon
as
those
receipts
have
began
to
be
received
by
the
cotton
merchants,
it's
moved
down
if
the
--
in
it's
a
continuous
milling
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
that.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
for
all
that
you
know,
i
might
replay
the
cotton
losses
immediately
in
an
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
i
don't
think
this
case
turns
on
how
long
the
cotton
stays
there.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
no,
it
would
not
your
honor
because
the
purchase
contract,
the
making
of
the
purchase
contract
is
the
protected
activity
here.
it's
entering
in
to
this
contract.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
even
if
you
made
that
assumption,
i
would
say
that
this
contract
was
an
interstate
commerce
when
it
was
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
in
this
case,
the
cotton
was
never
delivered,
so
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
is
to
how
long
it
would've
stay.
now
as
industry
practice
see
is
that
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
i
believe
that
we
would
be
--
we
know
from
the
industry
practice
as
describe
in
this
record
that
the
cotton
moves
out
of
the
state
all
during
the
succeeding
weeks
after
it's
harvested.
it
moves
out
just
like
the
wheat
crop
did
in
the
shafer
case
and
the
lemke
case.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
no,
the
farmer
sold
the
wheat
in
shafer
and
lemke
to
a
grain
elevator
operator
who
stored
it
there
and
then
when
he
made
a
carload
lots
and
shipped
that
out
afterwards.
in
1973,
the
price
of
cotton
back
unhappy
coincidence
rose
to
highest
levels
since
the
civil
war.
and
at
the
very
same
time,
the
decision
in
this
case
below
was
announced
which
cut
across
all
the
existing
contracts
in
our
industry
and
literally
faced
our
industry
with
bankruptcy.
disaster
was
avoided
because
of
the
honesty
of
most
cotton
farmers
in
the
south
and
also
because
of
the
decisive
action
of
the
federal
district
courts
in
mississippi
and
alabama
held
in
the
middle
of
the
delivery
season
that
these
contracts
were
made
in
interstate
commerce
and
they
maintain
the
pre-flow
law
of
cotton
out
of
those
states
under
court
order
and
under
injunctions.
despite
the
fact
that
this
case
is
typical
of
the
industry
practice
and
despite
the
fact
that
dahnke-walker
milling
company
case
rejects
the
title
passage
analyst,
pittman
seizes
on
one
aspect
of
this
case
and
builds
his
entire
argument
around
it,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
title
passes
to
allenberg,
and
for
short
period
of
time
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
we
have
title
to
cotton
which
is
located
in
a
compress
and
warehouse.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
which
i
--
i
think
that's
an
open
question.
and
i
think
if
this
court
gets
in
to
decide
in
qualification
cases
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
goods
are
taxable,
you
really
open
up
a
pandora's
box.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
sir
and
that
too.
cotton,
as
i've
tried
to
point
out
is
not
fungible
and
the
warehousing
step
is
absolutely
essential
to
buying
cotton
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
shipping
it
from
the
state.
cotton
cannot
leave
the
state
of
mississippi
until
it's
gone
through
this
process.
this
case
raises
the
question
that
was
post
in
the
robbins
versus
shelby
county
taxing
district
case,
and
that
is
if
the
commerce
clause
guarantees
a
buyer
of
cotton
access
to
mississippi
market
to
make
its
contracts
to
back
cotton
and
remove
it
from
the
state,
and
how
is
the
allenberg
cotton
company
to
go
into
the
mississippi
market
in
buy
cotton
and
move
it
out
of
the
state
without
qualifying
to
do
business?
another
answer
to
this
argument
of
the
--
of
appellee
is
that
it
proves
too
much.
the
appellee's
argument
would
mean
that
cotton
buyers
and
buyers
of
wheat
and
other
foreign
products
that
are
stored
for
which
negotiable
warehouse
receipts
are
now
freely
transferable
could
not
just
buy
or
make
a
contract
to
buy
any
negotiable
warehouse
receipt
in
the
country.
they
would
now
have
to
look
behind
the
receipt
to
determine
whether
they
will
qualify
to
do
business
in
the
state
where
the
goods
were
stored,
which
would
mean
that
negotiable
warehouse
receipts
would
not
longer
be
freely
negotiable.
under
the
decision
below,
a
very
substantial
trade
barrier
has
been
erected
around
the
state
of
mississippi.
no
buyer
who
is
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
mississippi
could
now
submit
a
bid
to
buy
cotton
there
because
if
he
submitted
the
bid
and
made
a
contract,
a
one-way
contract
would
be
created,
which
could
be
enforced
against
the
buyer,
but
if
the
farmer's
option
but
the
buyer
could
not
enforce
it
against
the
farmer.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
filing
a
number
of
informational
papers
about
the
corporation's
activities
and
the
basic
corporate
information
and
some
fees
and
renewing
that
each
year.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
it
is
annually
renewed
and
this
is
the
thing
that
gets
to
be
such
a
burden.
for
example,
when
we
qualified
allenberg
after
the
decision
in
this
case
in
the
17
different
states
where
it
shops
for
cotton,
it
took
us
about
two
months
and
we
had
the
employee
in
the
counting.
it
didn't
take
us
two
months
working
everyday,
but
i
mean
the
period
spread
out
over
that
long
in
time.
and
we
had
the
ct
corporation
sending
us
forms
and
we
have
to
get
an
accountant
coming
in
and
fill
out
the
forms
for
us
and
we
got
to
do
that
every
year.
now
as
a
result
as
a
practical
matter,
allenberg
just
going
to
quit
doing
business
in
the
couple
of
state
where
it
has
a
very
manner
interest
because
it's
just
the
administratively
too
expensive
to
compete
in
those
states
that
it
has
to
qualify.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
powell.
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
answer
that.
and
of
course
in
the
various
states,
would
--
there
are
upgraded
fee.
and
of
course,
we're
talking
here
not
just
about
qualifying
in
mississippi,
but
in
every
state
in
the
country.
in
other
industries
that
have
to
qualify
--
they
would
have
to
qualify
at
this
decision
we
made
at
the
law
of
the
land,
we'd
have
every
variation
in
the
50
states.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
your
honor.
it's
identical
for
the
entire
industry.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
not
every
state
has
this
“no
cure
statute.”
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
no
cure
sanction
is
what
is
got
our
industry
on
the
edge
because
what
is
happened
is
when
these
contracts
were
made
in
1973,
they
were
immediate
hedged
by
off
setting
sales
in
the
new
york
cotton
exchange.
those
hedges
are
maintained
with
margin
accounts
in
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
that
a
bank
financed.
everything
in
this
industry
is
financed
in
about
a
90%
basis.
now,
the
whole
principal
of
the
national
agricultural
marketing
system
is
that
the
hedge
will
be
valid,
the
sale
on
the
cotton
exchange
and
the
purchase
in
the
field
from
the
farmer.
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
all
of
a
sudden
told
us
the
purchase
contracts
were
no
longer
valid,
and
we're
looking
at
huge
loses
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
that
loses
what
would
have
destroyed
the
industry,
a
large
part
of
it
and
cost
substantial
loses
to
the
banks
that
financed
these
purchases.
and
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
excuse
me.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
sir,
the
same
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
of
cotton
futures
to
be
delivered
in
october
or
december
of
the
following
year
when
it
expected
that
this
cotton
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
of
the
same
year.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
but
--
yes
sir.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
contracts
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
are
in
100-bale
lots,
so
allenberg
made
this
contract
in
august
in
mississippi
decided
about
how
much
cotton
estimated
that's
involved.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
and
made
an
estimated
sale
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
at
identical
same
time.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
that's
usually
about
what
we
call
a
400-point
spread.
point
is
a
penny.
so
about
$4.00
or
$5.00
spread
between
the
price
that's
--
that
spread
covers
the
expected
cost
borrowing
the
money
to
maintain
the
hedge
for
the
year,
shipping
the
cotton,
paying
the
railroad
freight
and
so
on
to
get
it
to
a
point
of
deliver
in
the
following
year
when
it's
delivered.
so
if
we
bought
in
cotton
in
1973
a
30
cents
of
pound,
the
hedge
would
be
at
34
or
35
cents
a
pound.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
34
or
35
cents.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
and
of
course,
if
the
price
of
cotton
went
up
as
it
did
in
1973
to
almost
a
dollar
a
pound
for
the
first
time
since
the
civil
war,
we're
looking
at
loses
that
far
exceeded
the
capital
of
the
entire
industry.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
it
had
been
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
he
takes
it
to
local
gin,
that's
all
his
business.
he
gins
it,
then
brings
it
to
a
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
a
compress
in
warehouse.
the
compress
takes
the
loose
cotton
which
he
delivers
to
them
which
is
not
shippable
because
it's
also
loose.
and
compress
is
then
to
a
bale
and
cuts
the
sample
from
the
bale.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
making
even-running
lots
out
of
all
these
hundreds
of
bales.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
hedge
is
taken
out
by
an
offsetting
transaction
and
if
the
market
has
gone
up,
there's
a
loss
account
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange.
if
the
market
has
gone
down,
there's
a
gain
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
which
hopefully
offsets
the
loss
on
the
purchase
with
the
farmer.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
this
is
true
not
only
in
the
cotton
industry
but
wheat,
soy
beans
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
commodities
merchandising
industry
works
exactly
like
the
cotton
industry
does.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
your
honor,
we
felt
that
there
was
no
way
to
this
court
to
consider
the
case
without
considering
the
industry
context.
and
the
30
pages
that
you
refer
to
are
pages
drawn
from
well
established
cotton
industry
textbooks
to
gather
the
court
in
seeing
the
context
to
this
particular
contract
and
from
department
of
agriculture
publications.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
i
hope
that
that
has
not
happened
mr.
chief
justice
blackmun
and
i
apologize
for
burdening
the
court
with
the
extra
pages.
the
case
is
so
important
in
our
industry
that
perhaps
we
overdone
it,
but
it
didn't
want
to
leave
any
stone
unturned.
we're
fighting
for
our
lives.
thank
you.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
this
case
involves
is
whether
the
state
of
mississippi
can
require
foreign
corporations
to
obtain
a
license
to
buy
cotton
in
mississippi
and
ship
it
from
the
state.
my
client,
the
allenberg
cotton
company,
buys
cotton
in
the
state
of
mississippi
without
having
any
employees
in
the
state,
without
an
office
in
the
state,
without
owning
any
warehouses
in
the
state,
and
without
even
paying
for
the
cotton
in
the
state.
and
he
buys
that
cotton
for
the
purpose
of
shipping
every
bale
of
cotton
that
he
buys
out
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
allenberg
made
the
contract
that's
involved
here
following
an
industry
pattern
which
has
been
established
over
the
last
100
or
more
years,
like
almost
every
other
cotton
merchant
in
the
sale.
allenberg
bids
for
the
cotton
over
the
telephone
in
a
prior
year,
they
did
this
over
the
telegraph
and
it
submits
those
bids
to
local
cotton
brokers
all
over
the
south
and
makes
contracts
in
that
manner
without
qualification
to
do
business
in
the
various
states
where
bids
are
submitted
and
contracts
are
made.
this
pattern
of
activity
follows
a
pattern
which
has
been
protected
under
the
commerce
clause,
particularly
in
the
agriculture
merchandizing
industry
as
shown
in
the
decisions
of
dahnke-walker
milling
company,
lemke
versus
farmers
grain
company
and
shafer
versus
farmers
grain
company.
all
of
which
established
the
rule
that
making
purchases
to
back
commodities
for
shipment
out
of
a
state
is
an
activity
which
is
exempted
from
state
licensing
and
qualification
requirements
by
the
commerce
clause.
this
principle
was
articulated
recently
by
this
court
in
the
eli
lilly
decision.
in
that
decision,
all
men
of
the
justices
recognized
the
principle
that
commerce
clause
guarantees
free
access
to
all
markets
in
the
united
states
and
that
as
long
as
a
foreign
corporation
limits
it
since
activities
in
a
state
to
those
essential
activities
which
a
necessary
to
transact
business
in
interstate
commerce,
that
corporation
should
be
free
from
local
licensing
of
qualification
requirements.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii

eli
lilly
decision

justice
douglas.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
lilly.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
i'm
sorry
i
have
a
very
bad
cold.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes,
i
do.
the
principle
we
cite
it
for
is
the
principle
that
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
thank
you.
what
allenberg
did
in
this
case
fits
into
a
very
well
established
industry
pattern
and
in
of
the
pattern
of
existing
law.
in
january
1971,
pittman,
a
substantial
mississippi
cotton
planter
went
to
a
local
cotton
broker
and
i
asked
him
to
get
a
certain
price
for
his
cotton.
the
local
cotton
broker
picked
up
the
phone
and
telephones
the
allenberg
cotton
company
in
memphis.
and
after
some
negotiations
over
the
telephone,
a
contract
was
entered
into
it.
as
is
the
costume
in
the
trade,
allenberg
immediately
might
off
setting
sales
of
cotton
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
and
to
its
mill
customers
outside
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
broker
is
really
a
joint
agent.
the
broker
has
a
clientele
like
all
of
these
brokers
across
the
south.
they
are
the
local
cotton
producers.
they
come
to
him
or
he
may
go
to
them
and
the
broker
puts
the
buyer
and
sell
it
together
and
he's
paid
a
per
bale
commission
which
is
added
to
the
price
of
the
cotton.
sometimes,
it
comes
out
of
the
farmer's
pocket.
sometimes
the
commission
comes
out
of
the
buyer's
pocket
that
in
all
cases,
it's
added
to
the
price
of
cotton.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
title
is
never
in
the
broker's
name.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
he
did
in
prior
years
in
the
particular
year
involved
in
this
case,
he
did
not
buy
any
cotton
for
any
other
company,
but
we
didn't
restrict
him.
he
was
--
it
was
his
own
choice.
he
actually
acted
as
a
merchant
himself.
he
was
buying
cotton
for
his
own
account
during
that
year
and
acting
--
it
running
his
own
little
small
cotton
merchandizing
business.
and
on
the
side,
he
was
contracting
cotton
for
allenberg.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
he
acted
for
a
number
of
different
farmers
in
that
year.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
only
for
us,
but
that
was
his
own
choice.
it
was
just
a
coincidence.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we
have
no
control
of
what
he
did
and
did
not
act
of
the
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
in
the
commission
here
was
added
to
the
invoice
price
of
the
cotton
and
allenberg
paid
the
full
price
of
the
cotton
including
the
broker's
commission.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
fully
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
farmer
abated?
yes,
your
honor.
in
some
cases
where
the
farmer
invoices
his
cotton
directly
to
the
merchant
himself
by
attaching
his
negotiable
warehouse
for
seeks
to
a
draft
and
forwarding
in
directly
to
the
buyer's
bank,
he
may
receive
the
cash
and
have
to
go
to
the
broker
and
pay
him
his
commission.
in
this
case,
the
transaction
was
handled
through
the
broker's
office
and
so
what
the
broker
did
was
he
advance
his
own
money
to
the
farmer
and
then
attached
the
negotiable
warehouse
receipts
to
a
draft
and
drew
on
allenberg's
bank
in
memphis,
and
that
draft
included
his
commission.
under
this
contract
that
pittman
and
allenberg
made,
pittman
was
obligated
to
follow
the
normal
industry
practice
of
warehousing
his
cotton
after
it
was
harvested.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
contract
specifies
that
he
would
follow
normal
good
forming
methods.
it's
a
contractual
farmers'
that
he
didn't
--
if
he
didn't
leave
up
to,
he
would
be
subject
to
breach
of
contract
suit.
the
only
actual
controlled
that
allenberg
had
over,
but
they
had
no
control
over
his
farming
methods
except
insofar
as
he
was
obligated
to
use
normal
good
farming
methods.
if
the
ginning
process,
some
farmers
from
time
to
time
have
taken
wet
cotton
and
ginned
it
at
a
two
high,
a
temperature
went
ruin
the
cotton,
and
so
the
contract
specifies
that
the
buyer
will
have
the
option
to
control
the
ginning
temperature.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
on
the
going
crop
--
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
contract
was
made
in
january
before
pittman
ever
planted
a
single
seed.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
planning
is
the
spring
in
april.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
and
then
the
harvest
would
be
september,
october
anywhere
from
--
it
begins
at
the
point
depending
on
the
weather
and
end
as
late
of
march
--
i
mean
sorry,
as
late
as
december,
january.
if
weather
is
wet
last
year,
we
didn't
get
cotton
out
of
the
fields
until
march.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
it
was
for
all
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
--
they
produced
on
a
700
acres
of
land.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
whatever
was
produced.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
at
so
much
depending
on
the
quality
of
the
cotton.
they're
had
so
much
a
bale.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
there
were
several
grades.
now,
the
--
when
the
--
after
the
cotton
is
put
in
the
warehouse,
a
sample
is
cut
from
the
cottons
and
sent
to
the
department
of
agriculture.
the
us
department
of
agriculture
grades
the
cotton
and
since
they
are
independent,
that's
used
to
determine
how
much
the
farmers
paid
for
his
cotton.
another
sample
is
cut
from
the
bale
of
cotton
and
is
mailed
by
the
farmer
to
memphis.
now,
once
the
cotton
merchant
has
the
sample
in
memphis
and
the
negotiable
warehouse
receipt,
he
uses
those
samples
to
make
up
shipping
lots.
now,
the
ultimate
consumer
of
cotton
is
cotton
mills
and
they
use
it
in
--
traditionally
100-bale
lots.
each
bale
in
a
100-bale
lot
has
to
match
that
another
99
bales
in
grade,
staple
and
color.
otherwise,
it's
just
not
useable.
now,
the
cotton
does
not
come
out
of
the
fields
in
100-bale
even-running
lots.
one
of
the
primary
functions
of
the
merchant
performs
is
grouping
the
cotton
together
in
the
even-running
lots.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
cotton
merchant
in
memphis,
allenberg.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
it
perceives
the
samples
in
memphis,
uses
them
to
make
up
100-bale
shipping
lots
of
even-running
cottons.
it's
all
the
same.
and
at
that
point
and
not
before
then,
is
anybody
in
the
industry
able
to
determine
where
that
cotton
is
to
be
going?
it
can't
be
taken
from
the
fields
and
put
on
railroad
cars.
it
has
to
go
into
the
warehouse,
a
sample
has
to
be
cut,
group
with
another
like
bales,
and
then
shipping
orders
issued.
the
shipping
orders
are
issued
from
memphis
and
they're
a
long
list
of
the
bales
by
number.
each
bale
is
treated
individually
and
the
warehouseman
takes
the
list
and
mechanically
pulls
the
bales
out
and
puts
them
on
the
railroad
car
down
from
north
carolina
to
port
of
new
orleans
web.
the
point
of
that
is
that
the
cotton
cannot
move
out
of
the
state
of
mississippi
until
it's
been
warehoused
and
classified
in
the
manner
that's
--
that
allenberg
does
in
this
case.
now
on
the
existing
law,
the
activities
that
allenberg
performed
in
this
case
who
making
this
contract
as
a
commodities
merchant
are
recognized
as
essential
and
integral
parts
of
the
national
commodities
merchandising
system
and
of
interstate
commerce.
the
commodities
exchange
act,
7
u.s.c
section
3
states
that
a
transaction
in
respect
to
cotton
shall
be
considered
to
be
an
interstate
commerce,
if
the
transaction
is
a
part
of
the
current
of
commerce
usual
in
the
commodity's
trade
including
all
cases
where
the
purchase
is
for
shipment
out
of
the
state.
the
commodities
exchange
act
follows
the
definition
of
commerce,
interstate
commerce
which
was
established
in
the
leading
agriculture
marketing
cases
of
dahnke-walker
milling
company,
shafer
versus
farmers
grain,
lemke
versus
farmers
grain.
this
case
that's
before
the
court
today
is
stronger
than
those
cases.
in
shafer
and
lemke,
the
supreme
court
held
that
purchases
to
buy
wheat
were
made
in
interstate
commerce
and
not
subject
to
local
licensing
of
qualification
requirements,
eventhough
the
buyers
in
those
cases
were
located
in
the
state
had
employees
in
the
state,
offices
in
the
state,
paid
for
the
wheat
and
the
state
received
delivery
of
the
wheat
in
the
state,
and
eventhough
in
local
grain
elevators
in
the
state.
and
in
the
dahnke
case,
the
contract
between
the
selling
farmer
and
wheat
purchaser
in
that
case
was
held
to
be
an
interstate
commerce,
eventhough
the
farmer
did
not
know
he
was
making
a
contract
within
out
of
state
company.
and
in
here,
mr.
pittman
knew
from
the
beginning
that
he
was
making
a
contract
with
allenberg
cotton
company,
a
tennessee
corporation.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
sale
was
fob
course
in
dahnke,
but
the
sale
in
the
shafer
and
lemke
cases
was
delivery
at
the
grain
elevators
which
served
the
same
function
in
the
wheat
industry
that
the
cotton
warehouse
is
doing
in
car
industry.
allenberg's
purchased
--
well,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
also
strong
within
this
wheat
cases
because
in
the
wheat
cases,
they
said
it's
approximately
90%
of
the
wheat
left
the
state
of
south
dakota.
the
10%
was
use
locally
in
mississippi.
every
bale
of
cotton
or
virtually
ever
bale
that's
produced
in
the
state
is
shipped
from
the
state.
there
is
just
no
significant
amount
of
milling
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
cotton
is
one
of
the
nation's
most
important
exports.
in
1973,
there
was
seven
million
bales
of
cotton
exported
by
companies
just
like
my
client.
out
of
a
total
us
cotton
crop
of
12
millions
bales,
that
12
million
bales
in
1973
of
that
12
million
bales,
1.8
million
bales
were
raised
in
mississippi
alone.
and
in
1973,
the
time
this
decision
was
rendered
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
one
million
bales
of
cotton
in
the
state
of
mississippi
were
under
forward
contracts
identical
to
the
one
before
the
court
in
this
case.
for
this
reason,
the
decision
on
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
this
case
hit
our
industry
like
a
bombshell.
in
1973,
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
had
mounted
an
intensive
campaign
to
convince
everybody
in
the
cotton
industry
to
enter
into
forward
contracts.
that
is
contracts
that
are
made
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
for
the
farmer
producers
of
plants
this
cotton.
this
campaign
was
so
successful
in
1973.
the
three
out
of
every
four
bales
of
cotton
raised
in
the
country
was
subject
to
contracts
like
this
one
in
this
case.
the
decision
in
this
case
which
held
in
the
middle
of
the
year
that
a
foreign
cotton
buyer
could
not
enforce
his
contract
in
the
mississippi
court,
literally
threatened
to
ruin
our
entire
industry.
if
this
decision
has
stood
in
just
mississippi
alone
which
it
did
not,
thanks
to
the
innovation
of
the
federal
district
courts
there.
a
large
part
of
our
industry
would
have
been
destroyed
and
i
believe
the
entire
nation
would
have
suffered.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we
did
qualify
immediately
thereafter,
but
under
the
decision
below,
subsequent
qualification
does
not
cure
the
defects.
you
can
never
sue
on
a
contract
made
in
mississippi.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
we
could,
but
this
in
1973
where
made
before
this
decision
was
announced.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
it
has
an
impact
in
this
manner
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
under
present
mississippi
law
with
this
no
cure
or
statute,
there's
a
market
barrier
raised
around
the
boarders
of
the
state.
a
cotton
company
that's
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
mississippi
cannot
mail
even
submit
a
bid
to
buy
cotton
there.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we
have,
yes.
and
companies
that
--
large
companies
of
course
will
qualify
and
establish
themselves
in
the
markets,
but
they
won't
be
the
free
competition.
they
won't
--
a
farmer
in
mr.
pittman's
position
today
can't
pick
up
the
phone
and
shop
his
cotton
with
any
cotton
merchant
in
the
country.
he's
limited
to
those
who
previously
qualified
to
do
business
from
mississippi.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
burden
is
a
--
these
are
small
companies
mr.
justice
white
and
they
are
500
to
a
thousand
of
them
and
the
administrative
cost
in
our
industry
are
very
significant
factor
in
determining
what
areas
of
competition
we
operate
in.
the
essential
tools
of
the
cotton
merchant
are
desk
and
a
telephone
in
a
good
bank
line
of
credit.
and
we
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
and
not
a
lawyer.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
because
the
allenberg
cotton
company
is
a
matter
of
fact
is
headed
by
yale
lawyer.
these
companies
are
not
qualify
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
a
free
trader,
absolutely
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
dahnke-walker
case
and
lemke
and
shafer.
this
administrative
cost
i
know
when
after
this
decision,
we
have
to
qualify
allenberg
in
every
state.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we're
not
worried
about
it
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
be
happy
to
pay
whatever
mississippi
taxes
were
due
because
they're
non-due.
the
state
of
tax
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
that
would
be
all
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
they
have
to
be
separated
and
they
always
have
been
for
this
reason.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes,
sir.
we
supposedly
a
common
market
in
this
country
and
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
we
don't
store
the
cotton
there
your
honor.
the
farmer
that
places
it
there
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
that's
exactly
right;
warehouse
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
there's
a
small
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
not
in
relation
to
the
industry
practice.
it's
a
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
cotton
crop
begins
to
come
in,
in
september
and
october,
and
as
soon
as
those
receipts
have
began
to
be
received
by
the
cotton
merchants,
it's
moved
down
if
the
--
in
it's
a
continuous
milling
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
that.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
for
all
that
you
know,
i
might
replay
the
cotton
losses
immediately
in
an
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
i
don't
think
this
case
turns
on
how
long
the
cotton
stays
there.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
no,
it
would
not
your
honor
because
the
purchase
contract,
the
making
of
the
purchase
contract
is
the
protected
activity
here.
it's
entering
in
to
this
contract.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
even
if
you
made
that
assumption,
i
would
say
that
this
contract
was
an
interstate
commerce
when
it
was
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
in
this
case,
the
cotton
was
never
delivered,
so
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
is
to
how
long
it
would've
stay.
now
as
industry
practice
see
is
that
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
i
believe
that
we
would
be
--
we
know
from
the
industry
practice
as
describe
in
this
record
that
the
cotton
moves
out
of
the
state
all
during
the
succeeding
weeks
after
it's
harvested.
it
moves
out
just
like
the
wheat
crop
did
in
the
shafer
case
and
the
lemke
case.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
no,
the
farmer
sold
the
wheat
in
shafer
and
lemke
to
a
grain
elevator
operator
who
stored
it
there
and
then
when
he
made
a
carload
lots
and
shipped
that
out
afterwards.
in
1973,
the
price
of
cotton
back
unhappy
coincidence
rose
to
highest
levels
since
the
civil
war.
and
at
the
very
same
time,
the
decision
in
this
case
below
was
announced
which
cut
across
all
the
existing
contracts
in
our
industry
and
literally
faced
our
industry
with
bankruptcy.
disaster
was
avoided
because
of
the
honesty
of
most
cotton
farmers
in
the
south
and
also
because
of
the
decisive
action
of
the
federal
district
courts
in
mississippi
and
alabama
held
in
the
middle
of
the
delivery
season
that
these
contracts
were
made
in
interstate
commerce
and
they
maintain
the
pre-flow
law
of
cotton
out
of
those
states
under
court
order
and
under
injunctions.
despite
the
fact
that
this
case
is
typical
of
the
industry
practice
and
despite
the
fact
that
dahnke-walker
milling
company
case
rejects
the
title
passage
analyst,
pittman
seizes
on
one
aspect
of
this
case
and
builds
his
entire
argument
around
it,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
title
passes
to
allenberg,
and
for
short
period
of
time
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
we
have
title
to
cotton
which
is
located
in
a
compress
and
warehouse.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
which
i
--
i
think
that's
an
open
question.
and
i
think
if
this
court
gets
in
to
decide
in
qualification
cases
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
goods
are
taxable,
you
really
open
up
a
pandora's
box.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
sir
and
that
too.
cotton,
as
i've
tried
to
point
out
is
not
fungible
and
the
warehousing
step
is
absolutely
essential
to
buying
cotton
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
shipping
it
from
the
state.
cotton
cannot
leave
the
state
of
mississippi
until
it's
gone
through
this
process.
this
case
raises
the
question
that
was
post
in
the
robbins
versus
shelby
county
taxing
district
case,
and
that
is
if
the
commerce
clause
guarantees
a
buyer
of
cotton
access
to
mississippi
market
to
make
its
contracts
to
back
cotton
and
remove
it
from
the
state,
and
how
is
the
allenberg
cotton
company
to
go
into
the
mississippi
market
in
buy
cotton
and
move
it
out
of
the
state
without
qualifying
to
do
business?
another
answer
to
this
argument
of
the
--
of
appellee
is
that
it
proves
too
much.
the
appellee's
argument
would
mean
that
cotton
buyers
and
buyers
of
wheat
and
other
foreign
products
that
are
stored
for
which
negotiable
warehouse
receipts
are
now
freely
transferable
could
not
just
buy
or
make
a
contract
to
buy
any
negotiable
warehouse
receipt
in
the
country.
they
would
now
have
to
look
behind
the
receipt
to
determine
whether
they
will
qualify
to
do
business
in
the
state
where
the
goods
were
stored,
which
would
mean
that
negotiable
warehouse
receipts
would
not
longer
be
freely
negotiable.
under
the
decision
below,
a
very
substantial
trade
barrier
has
been
erected
around
the
state
of
mississippi.
no
buyer
who
is
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
mississippi
could
now
submit
a
bid
to
buy
cotton
there
because
if
he
submitted
the
bid
and
made
a
contract,
a
one-way
contract
would
be
created,
which
could
be
enforced
against
the
buyer,
but
if
the
farmer's
option
but
the
buyer
could
not
enforce
it
against
the
farmer.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
filing
a
number
of
informational
papers
about
the
corporation's
activities
and
the
basic
corporate
information
and
some
fees
and
renewing
that
each
year.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
it
is
annually
renewed
and
this
is
the
thing
that
gets
to
be
such
a
burden.
for
example,
when
we
qualified
allenberg
after
the
decision
in
this
case
in
the
17
different
states
where
it
shops
for
cotton,
it
took
us
about
two
months
and
we
had
the
employee
in
the
counting.
it
didn't
take
us
two
months
working
everyday,
but
i
mean
the
period
spread
out
over
that
long
in
time.
and
we
had
the
ct
corporation
sending
us
forms
and
we
have
to
get
an
accountant
coming
in
and
fill
out
the
forms
for
us
and
we
got
to
do
that
every
year.
now
as
a
result
as
a
practical
matter,
allenberg
just
going
to
quit
doing
business
in
the
couple
of
state
where
it
has
a
very
manner
interest
because
it's
just
the
administratively
too
expensive
to
compete
in
those
states
that
it
has
to
qualify.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
powell.
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
answer
that.
and
of
course
in
the
various
states,
would
--
there
are
upgraded
fee.
and
of
course,
we're
talking
here
not
just
about
qualifying
in
mississippi,
but
in
every
state
in
the
country.
in
other
industries
that
have
to
qualify
--
they
would
have
to
qualify
at
this
decision
we
made
at
the
law
of
the
land,
we'd
have
every
variation
in
the
50
states.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
your
honor.
it's
identical
for
the
entire
industry.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
not
every
state
has
this
“no
cure
statute.”
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
no
cure
sanction
is
what
is
got
our
industry
on
the
edge
because
what
is
happened
is
when
these
contracts
were
made
in
1973,
they
were
immediate
hedged
by
off
setting
sales
in
the
new
york
cotton
exchange.
those
hedges
are
maintained
with
margin
accounts
in
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
that
a
bank
financed.
everything
in
this
industry
is
financed
in
about
a
90%
basis.
now,
the
whole
principal
of
the
national
agricultural
marketing
system
is
that
the
hedge
will
be
valid,
the
sale
on
the
cotton
exchange
and
the
purchase
in
the
field
from
the
farmer.
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
all
of
a
sudden
told
us
the
purchase
contracts
were
no
longer
valid,
and
we're
looking
at
huge
loses
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
that
loses
what
would
have
destroyed
the
industry,
a
large
part
of
it
and
cost
substantial
loses
to
the
banks
that
financed
these
purchases.
and
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
excuse
me.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
sir,
the
same
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
of
cotton
futures
to
be
delivered
in
october
or
december
of
the
following
year
when
it
expected
that
this
cotton
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
of
the
same
year.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
but
--
yes
sir.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
contracts
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
are
in
100-bale
lots,
so
allenberg
made
this
contract
in
august
in
mississippi
decided
about
how
much
cotton
estimated
that's
involved.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
and
made
an
estimated
sale
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
at
identical
same
time.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
that's
usually
about
what
we
call
a
400-point
spread.
point
is
a
penny.
so
about
$4.00
or
$5.00
spread
between
the
price
that's
--
that
spread
covers
the
expected
cost
borrowing
the
money
to
maintain
the
hedge
for
the
year,
shipping
the
cotton,
paying
the
railroad
freight
and
so
on
to
get
it
to
a
point
of
deliver
in
the
following
year
when
it's
delivered.
so
if
we
bought
in
cotton
in
1973
a
30
cents
of
pound,
the
hedge
would
be
at
34
or
35
cents
a
pound.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
34
or
35
cents.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
and
of
course,
if
the
price
of
cotton
went
up
as
it
did
in
1973
to
almost
a
dollar
a
pound
for
the
first
time
since
the
civil
war,
we're
looking
at
loses
that
far
exceeded
the
capital
of
the
entire
industry.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
it
had
been
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
he
takes
it
to
local
gin,
that's
all
his
business.
he
gins
it,
then
brings
it
to
a
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
a
compress
in
warehouse.
the
compress
takes
the
loose
cotton
which
he
delivers
to
them
which
is
not
shippable
because
it's
also
loose.
and
compress
is
then
to
a
bale
and
cuts
the
sample
from
the
bale.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
making
even-running
lots
out
of
all
these
hundreds
of
bales.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
hedge
is
taken
out
by
an
offsetting
transaction
and
if
the
market
has
gone
up,
there's
a
loss
account
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange.
if
the
market
has
gone
down,
there's
a
gain
on
the
new
york
cotton
exchange
which
hopefully
offsets
the
loss
on
the
purchase
with
the
farmer.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
this
is
true
not
only
in
the
cotton
industry
but
wheat,
soy
beans
--
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
the
commodities
merchandising
industry
works
exactly
like
the
cotton
industry
does.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
your
honor,
we
felt
that
there
was
no
way
to
this
court
to
consider
the
case
without
considering
the
industry
context.
and
the
30
pages
that
you
refer
to
are
pages
drawn
from
well
established
cotton
industry
textbooks
to
gather
the
court
in
seeing
the
context
to
this
particular
contract
and
from
department
of
agriculture
publications.
mr.
john
mcquiston,
ii
well,
i
hope
that
that
has
not
happened
mr.
chief
justice
blackmun
and
i
apologize
for
burdening
the
court
with
the
extra
pages.
the
case
is
so
important
in
our
industry
that
perhaps
we
overdone
it,
but
it
didn't
want
to
leave
any
stone
unturned.
we're
fighting
for
our
lives.
thank
you.
