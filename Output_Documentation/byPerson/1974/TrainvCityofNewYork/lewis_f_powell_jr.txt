justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
mr.
solicitor
general
initially
i
think
did
not
the
government
take
position
that
this
commitment
of
$18
billion
perhaps
that's
not
the
word,
right
word
here,
this
$18
billion
did
not
necessarily
have
to
be
spent,
but
now
i
gather
that
the
position
of
the
government
and
that
must
be
spent
under
this
legislation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
discretion
is
such
that
it
may
be
spent
over
a
period
of
time.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
to
that
extent,
when
you
say
it
must
be
spent
to
that
extent,
and
that's
to
say
it's
been
appropriated,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
that's
i
understand
you
say
that
but
to
the
extent
that
the
$18
billion
must
be
spent,
congress
has
indicated
that
it's
going
to
be
there.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
yet
you
think
something
else
may
be
necessarily
the
nature
of
congressional
appropriations
in
fact
to
make
the
$18
billion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
on
page
9
of
your
brief,
as
i
understand
it,
that
down
to
bottom
of
page
9,
you
say
in
effect
that
there
is
no
practical
difference
between
exercising
control
over
the
rate
of
spending
at
the
two
stages
if
i
understand
that
and
if
that
is
correct,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
parties
here
today?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
in
effect
you
are
protecting
a
future
position,
the
ultimate
affect
that
a
judge,
in
your
opinion,
unless
you
heard
flunk
in
this
way,
it
will
be
the
same.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
gather,
mr.
solicitor,
that
if
we
would
agree
with
you,
you
would
still
feel
whether
the
choice
was
at
the
allotment
stage
or
at
the
allegation
stage,
or
to
be
reversals
in
both
of
these
cases
where
the
remands
for
dismissal
for
both
complaints?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
latter
on
the
ground
that
this
is
a
non-reviewable
discretion
and
therefore
a
political
question
in
that
sense?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
(inaudible).
if
we
disagree
--
your
position
is
that
the
discretion
is
to
be
exercised
at
the
allot
--
at
the
obligation
stage.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
at
the
allotment
stage.
now,
the
judgments
below
disagree
with
that,
do
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
well,
in
so
far
as
it
was
held
below
that
the
judgment
at
the
allotment
stage
wouldn't
we
have
to
affirm
in
that
respect,
if
we
agreed
with
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
send
it
back
to
dismissal.
dismissal.
