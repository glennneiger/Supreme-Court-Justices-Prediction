but
ordinarily
i,
a
different
â€“-
the
mere
fact
and
authorization
doesn't
give
any
assurance
to
anyone
that
necessarily
would
be
in
the
appropriation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here
there's
something
more
may
not
be
a
complete
assurance
of
appropriation
but
i
gather
you're
saying
that
they
can't
let
the
states
down,
almost
they'll
have
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
congress
certainly
will
have
to.
it
was
indicated
that
definitely
it
will.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
extent,
this
is
a
little
different
than
the
ordinary
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
case,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
important
thing
here
is,
whether
we
say
allotment
or
obligation,
your
real
concern
is
the
breadth
of
discretion
of
the
president.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
that
your
light
is
running
out
mr.
bork,
are
you
going
to
say
anything
about
this,
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
read
it
only
roughly
this
morning.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
thompson
you're
going
to
suggest
what
the
practical
difference
is
that
the
time
it
takes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
knowing
advance
that
you're
going
to
have
$350
million,
i'll
put
you
in
the
position
where
you
can
plan
around
a
possibility
of
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
say
that
again?
