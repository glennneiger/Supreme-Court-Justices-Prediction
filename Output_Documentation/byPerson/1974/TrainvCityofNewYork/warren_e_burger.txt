chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1377,
train
against
new
york
and
train
against
campaign
clean
water.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
what
it
makes
unique?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
does
this
takes
it
outside
of
what
has
been
our
common
rubric
in
the
appropriations
committee
that
the
congress
proposes
but
we
the
appropriations
committee
dispose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
mechanism
would
be
that
if
the
house
appropriations
committee
declined
to
appropriate
and
the
senate
appropriations
committee
also,
you
are
suggesting
the
house
and
the
senate
could
override.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
reject
that
would
take
care
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
in
view
of
the
way
the
timing
is
working
out
here
today,
we'll
extend
for
your
side
of
the
table
six
minutes
and
give
the
solicitor
general
six
minutes
more
that
will
consist
of
approximately
right
at
3
o'clock,
so
you
can
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
accordingly,
mr.
thompson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
that
not
concede
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
take
a
more
extreme
example
if
suddenly
we
got
him
to
some
peripheral
war
that
might
have
a
lot
to
do
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
resolution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
thompson,
mr.
jacks,
you
will
have
about
18-and-a-half
minutes
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
the
solicitor
general's
representation
of
the
government's
policy
or
position
with
respect
to
the
commitment
of
the
entire
$18
billion
at
least
to
cut
some
of
the
foundation
away
from
that
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
the
power
of
congress
to
deal
with
this
by
resolution
at
any
time
give
any
conflict
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
some
difficulty
with
that
mr.
jacks.
you
said
congress
can't
do
anything
about
it
now.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
it
might
be
very
clumsy,
very
slow,
very
burdensome
that
congress
can
do
anything
at
once
too
on
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
day
after
tomorrow,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
jacks.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
have
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
up
to
this
time,
mr.
solicitor
general
that
suggests
that
this
astronomical
figure
that
you
now
mentioned
was
in
contemplation
when
they
got
there,
putting
the
door
with
$18
billion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nobody
--
nobody
really
knows,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
an
executive,
especially
presumably
specially
informed
in
the
field.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
with
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
would
not
preclude
an
administrator
from
sua
sponte
promulgating
regulations
or
invading
rule
making
as
you
intimated,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
$300
to
$350
billion
that
might
well
be
indicated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
thompson,
mr.
jacks,
it
appears
that
you
have
not
until
recently
and
perhaps
only
today
will
have
received
the
supplemental
brief.
if
you
find
that
there
is
something
in
the
supplemental
brief
that
you'd
like
to
comment
thereon,
will
you
kindly
inform
the
clerks,
so
that
the
court
will
be
advised
and
for
consideration
until
we
have
any
comments
that
you
wish
to
make.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-1377,
train
against
the
city
of
new
york
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
white.
