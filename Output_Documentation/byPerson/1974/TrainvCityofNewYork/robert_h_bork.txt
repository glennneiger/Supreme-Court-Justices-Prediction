mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
fourth
circuit.
each
is
in
action
seeking
to
compel
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
of
protection
agency
to
increase
allotments
he
has
made
under
title
ii
of
the
water
pollution
control
act
amendments.
i
had
best
described
the
statutory
process
which
is
deeply
involved
in
this
case.
this
act
provides
federal
funds
to
pay
75%
of
the
cost
to
states
and
municipalities
of
the
construction
of
sewage
treatment
facilities
and
the
act
--
the
funding
process
the
operations
several
stages.
first,
congress
must
enact
an
authorization
for
appropriations
of
a
certain
size.
now,
that
is
not
an
appropriation.
it's
more
of
a
statement
of
intent
to
appropriate
on
a
later
date
and
that
begins
this
process.
second,
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
working
within
that
authorization
allots
various
amounts
to
the
states
on
a
formula
suggested
by
the
act.
when
that
has
been
done,
when
the
allotments
has
been
made,
the
states
make
proposals
for
construction
of
water
treatment
facilities,
sewage
treatment
facilities
that
they
think
are
most
pressing,
and
if
these
are
approved,
thus
meeting
with
criteria,
that
approval
by
the
administrator
constitutes
an
obligation
of
the
united
states.
and
all
that
remained
to
be
done
is
for
the
grantees
to
make
the
expenditures,
congress
appropriates
the
funds
and
they
are
paid
over
to
the
grantees.
now,
the
issues
we
have
today
are
two,
and
the
first
is
whether
the
president
acting
through
the
administrator
has
discretion
at
the
second
stage
of
this
process,
that
is
the
allotment
stage,
to
allot
the
states
amounts
less
than
congress
has
authorized
to
be
appropriated.
and
second,
if
he
has
such
discretion,
whether
that
discretion
is
reviewable
in
the
courts.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
there
is
no
discretion
at
the
allotment
stage
but
there
is
some
discretion
at
the
obligation
stage.
the
approval
of
plant,
the
fourth
circuit
assumed
that
there
was
discretion
at
the
allotment
stage,
because
the
respondents,
plaintiffs
below
in
that
case
conceded
it,
and
the
district
court
had
found
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
a
trial
de
novo
of
whether
assuming
the
discretion,
the
administrator
had
abused
it
or
exceeded
it.
in
a
word,
i
think
everybody
agrees
in
this
case
that
the
president
has
discretion
at
some
stage
of
this
process.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
it
very
clear
to
at
the
outset
to
remove
any
element
of
drama
from
this
case.
we
are
not
here
asserting
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
may
eliminate
both
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
meant
to
say
drama.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
correct.
i
will
try
not
to
eliminate
grammar
as
i
go
along.
we
are
not
asserting
any
constitutional
power
of
the
president
in
this
case.
there
is
here
no
element
of
confrontation
between
the
president
and
the
congress.
we
rely
entirely
upon
the
discretion
we
think
congress
gave
the
president
intentionally,
in
the
act,
and
in
that
we
are
supported
by
respondent's
concessions
that
some
discretion
is
built
into
the
act.
although
they
do
not
agree
with
us
or
indeed
sometimes
with
each
other,
about
how
or
when
it's
to
be
exercised.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
we
are
making
no
constitutional
argument.
i
should
also
say
that
these
statutes
under
which
impoundment
has
occurred
in
the
past,
in
many
of
which
i
think
impoundment
is
no
longer
occurring,
common
of
wide
variety
of
shapes
and
forms
and
processes,
so
that
these
cases
today
before
us
are
quite
unlikely
to
settle
the
issue
of
withholding
of
funds
under
other
statutory
programs.
this
statute
is
unique.
well,
to
get
to
these
cases,
congress
authorized
the
appropriation
of
not
to
exceed
$5
billion
for
fiscal
year
in
1973,
and
$6
billion
for
fiscal
year
1974.
the
administrator
of
epa
at
the
direction
of
the
president
allotted
for
those
years
respectively
two
and
three
billion
dollars.
a
total
allotment
of
$5
billion
as
opposed
to
the
$11
billion
authorized
for
appropriation.
now,
i
should
also
say
that
the
remainder,
the
administration
position
is
that
the
remainder
of
these
allotments
will
be
made
in
the
future.
so,
that
this
case
concerns
a
rate
of
spending,
rather
than
the
total
amount
to
be
spent
on
this
program
over
time.
i
would
address
first
the
issue
raised
by
the
city
of
new
york
which
is
the
stage
of
the
process
at
which
discretion
maybe
exercised
and
then
i
will
discuss
the
issue
raised
by
campaign
clean
water,
the
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
scope
and
reviewability
of
the
discretion.
when
it
gets
clearer
that
the
president's
discretion
is
to
be
authorized
at
the
allotment
stage,
and
we
have
for
that
the
rather
mundane
reason
that
that
is
what
the
statute
says,
and
that
we
agree
with
campaign
clean
water
on
that
point
and
disagree
with
the
city
of
new
york
on
that
point.
now,
city
of
new
york
makes
much
plain
of
the
fact
that
in
the
debates,
various
congressmen
who
were
engaged
at
that
point
in
stressing
the
legitimacy
of
the
president's
impoundment
of
funds
under
the
statute.
however,
in
stressing
that
discretion,
that
the
president
was
to
given
used
words
like
discretion
overspending,
discretion
over
obligation
and
it's
almost
entirely
from
that
slim
foundation,
that
the
respondent
tries
to
argue
that
congress
deliberately
ruled
out
discretion
at
the
allotment
stage.
we
think
that
in
the
face
of
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute,
that
argument
is
altogether
too
thin.
and
it's
worth
noting
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
natural
way
to
talk
about
in
impoundment
issues.
indeed,
public
discussion
generally
talks
about
the
president's
ability
to
control
spending,
even
when
under
a
technical
statute,
the
discretion
is
authorized
at
some
other
stage
than
the
actual
payment
of
the
money.
and
that's
an
accurate
way
to
speak
because
when
the
president
directs
the
administrator
not
to
allot
the
full
sum,
the
result
of
course
is
a
deferral
of
obligation
and
deferral
of
spending
as
well,
and
that's
what
the
discretion
is
all
about,
ultimately
the
federal
spending.
so,
naturally
congressmen
talked
about
it
in
those
terms.
and
we
can't
place
all
that
much
weight
on
their
failure
in
these
debates
constantly
to
use
the
quite
technical
terms
of
a
very
noble
process,
which
this
act
contains.
what
we
do
know,
unmistakably
from
the
debate
in
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
president
discretion
and
that
it
did
that,
its
vehicle
for
giving
discretion,
where
the
amendments
proposed
by
representative
harsha,
who
was
a
chief
sponsor
of
the
act.
and
those
amendments
were
proposed
to
sections
205(a)
and
section
207.
now,
section
205(a)
which
was
amended
for
this
purpose,
is
an
allotment
provision,
and
it's
plain
to
us
therefore
that
the
discretion
given
is
in
making
allotments.
as
originally
drafted,
the
house
bill
said
this,
in
section
205(a),
the
allotment
provision,
it
said,
“all
sums
to
be
appropriated
pursuant
to
section
207th
shall
be
allotted
by
the
administrator.”
and
section
207
released
authorized
the
appropriation
of
the
amounts.
now,
that
language
about
allotment
sounded
quite
mandatory
to
some.
all
sums
authorized
shall
be
allotted.
explicitly,
to
make
sure
that
the
president
had
discretion,
the
harsha
amendment
changed
that,
the
word
all
was
deleted,
and
from
section
205(a),
so
that
the
administrator
was
merely
told
to
allot
the
sums
authorized
under
section
207.
and
section
207,
in
turn,
was
amended,
to
read
that
there
was
authorized
that
to
be
appropriated
and
then
they
added
the
words
“not
to
exceed,
five
and
six
billion
for
the
two
years”
in
question
here.
now,
if
the
intention,
as
the
city
of
new
york
contends
were
to
place
discretion
at
the
obligation
stage,
then
as
the
other
respondent
points
out,
it
will
be
quite
extraordinary
for
congress
to
choose
to
amend
those
allotment
sections,
they
would've
amended
section
203,
which
is
the
--
which
is
the
obligation
which
provides
to
the
obligation
process
to
say
that
he
need
not
obligate
more
than
--
you
may
not
obligate
more
than
but
may
obligate
less.
so,
when
we're
faced
with
the
statute,
which
provides
discretion,
provides
discretion
in
the
allotment
provision,
and
when
those
amendments
are
known
to
have
been
intended
to
provide
that
discretion,
for
legislative
history,
i
fail
to
see
how
the
president,
or
the
administrator,
could
responsively
have
ignored
that
text,
allotted
all
the
sums
and
then
begun
to
exercise
discretion
at
the
obligation
stage.
if
the
president
had
done
that,
i
think
the
city
of
new
york
would've
sued
this.
i
think
they
might
we
have
contended
that
discretion
is
largely
to
the
allotment
stage,
and
once
the
allotments
are
made,
and
the
rest
is
ministerial
and
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
funds,
and
i
think
they
would
have
had
a
better
argument
than
the
one
they
have
now.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
was
a
veto
message
which
related
to
the
objection
to
the
level
of
spending,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
not,
he
does
refer
to
the
fact
that
he'
worried
about
federal
spending,
but
i
think
that
was
not
--
the
president
seems
worried
about
federal
spending
and
the
effect
on
inflation
and
taxes
and
so
forth.
i
do
not
recall,
let
me
be
corrected
if
i'm
wrong,
i
do
not
recall
if
there's
anything
that
addresses
this
kind
of
technical
question
on
that
what
stage.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
recall
it
this
--
as
to
a
discretion
yes,
he
thought
that
he
didn't
have
enough
in
the
veto
message
and
indeed
in
overwriting
the
veto,
congress,
a
number
of
congressmen
explicitly
said
that
it's
too
bad
he
thought
that
because
he's
plainly
does
have
discretion.
but
that
goes
less
to
the
--
that
goes
to
the
existence
and
width
of
the
discretion,
rather
than
the
stage
at
which
it
must
be
exercised.
and
i
should
say
this,
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
government
has
very
little
interest
in
which
way
in
at
what
stage
the
discretion
must
be
exercised.
we
brought
this
case
up,
the
city
of
new
york
case,
because
if
we
acquiesce
in
the
judgment
that
there
was
no
discretion
at
the
allotment
stage,
we
thought
we
were
quite
likely
be
would
sought
it
by
another
lawsuit
in
which
the
court
said,
any
discretion
you
had
was
at
the
allotment
stage,
now
you
must
obligate,
and
so
although
everybody
agree
if
he
has
discretion
in
there
someplace,
we
would've
lost
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
a
variety
of
arguments
in
these
briefs,
which
are
quite
persuasive
until
you
realize
that
they
are
all
arguments
that
congress
should
have
written
a
different
statute.
and
that
if
the
statute
is
applied
as
written,
their
ability
to
plan
or
something
else
will
be
harmed,
that
may
be
true.
but
i
think
the
ability
to
plan
is
such
in
the
lead
time
and
these
things
is
fairly
extensive,
they
can
plan
from
the
allotments
given.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct,
they
are
not
about
to
commit
themselves
which
is
this.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
on
the
other
hand
mr.
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
they
are
now
able
to
begin
to
plan
in
that
sense.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
to
plan,
yes
mr.
justice
white,
maybe
were
using
the
words
in
a
different
sense,
but
the
administration
construes
--
construes
the
statute
to
require
that
all
of
the
sums
be
expended
and
there
is
now
under
discussion
of
variety
of
ways
of
timing
for
the
release
of
these
funds
they
may
state
that
no
final
decision
has
been
made,
so
that
planning
for
what
-–
where
will
we
use
this
funds
and
in
what
way
when
they
become
available
could
go
on
now.
obviously,
it
would
be
unwise
to
enter
into
commitments,
contractual
commitments
now
for
the
unalloted
funds.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
would
hesitate
to
give
a
firm
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
we
might
have
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
which
we
might
have
to
defend.
i
don't
envision
congress
having
encouraged
states
by
saying,
we
will
appropriate
at
some
future
date,
a
total
of
$18
billion
and
the
sum
has
been
allotted,
plans
are
put
in
and
the
states
make
the
expenditures,
i
really
can't
contemplate
that
congress
at
that
stage
would
say,
we
were
quite
mistakenly,
we
don't
intend
to
appropriate
funds.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
it
may
be,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
here,
it
may
authorize
it
but
if
states
have
gone
forward,
and
expanded
their
own
funds
and
got
themselves
into
commitments,
which
are
legally
binding,
i
think
it
could
be
extraordinary
if
congress
bend
back
down
on
its
promise.
and
furthermore,
there
might
be
at
that
stage,
i
think,
litigation
about
the
obligation
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
i
understand
it,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
part
of
this
process
of
authorizing
for
appropriation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't
think
it's
usual
to
have
a
process
in
which
you
authorize
for
appropriation
and
then
go
to
the
allotment
stage
and
the
obligation
stage
and
then
appropriate,
i
may
be
quite
if
that's
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
had
this
--
the
authorization
for
appropriation
and
its
purpose
explained
to
me
and
i
was
told
that
it
is
quite
unique
in
this
kind
of
a
statute.
i
can
perhaps
shed
further
light
upon
that
later,
i
can't
now.
one
of
the
reasons
is
usually,
when
you
have
to
go
to
a
project,
you
go
through
the
appropriations
committee.
this
stage,
congress
in
effect
authorizes
the
appropriation
without
going
to
the
appropriations
committee,
which
does
considerably
limit
the
appropriations
committee's
discretion
at
a
later
date.
i
think
that's
what
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
this
does
tend,
i
don't
think
this
is
that
i
may
say
so,
central
to
the
issue
we
have
before
us,
but
i
think
this
does
to
some
degree
limit
appropriation
of
committee's
influence
on
the
size
of
the
appropriations.
but
i
think
the
--
i
think
that
affect
does
not.
it
may
have
account
for
some
of
the
confusion
in
this
entire
process
but
it
does
not
go
to
the
question
i
think
which
is
before
us
which
is
the
president's
discretion,
and
how
broad
it
is,
and
as
i
say
that's
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
the--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
may
be
--
the
amount
we
now
believe
is
firm,
it
may
be
stretched
out
in
the
expenditure.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
no,
no
i
mean
we
think
the
executive
under
the
statute
has
an
obligation
to
allot
the
$18
billion
ultimately.
but
the
executive
we
think
was
given
a
discretion
that
control
the
timing
and
we
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
as
congress
has
certainly
indicated
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so.
i
think
they
have
to
pass
the
appropriations
bill.
they
simply
get
what
the
statute
itself
provides
that
we
will
appropriate
the
money
at
a
later
date.
so
under
the
scheme,
they
must
do
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white,
the
discretion
is
timing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
said
to
that
only
one
that
i
will
find
to
be
extraordinary
if
congress
got
states
into
this
position
and
then
let
them
down,
and
i
would
think
that
there
might
well
be
litigation
in
the
court
of
claims
over
litigation
is
to
which
i
think
i
have
not,
not
--
not
now
to
take
a
position.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
have
certainly
indicated
that
and
i
think
that
is
a
moral
commitment
at
the
very
least.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so.
i
think
under
the
main
effect
of
this
process
is
that
a
moral
commitment
is
made
which
the
appropriations
committee,
i
think,
would
be
bound
to
respect.
but
i
wanted
to
discuss
the
scope
of
this
discretion
because
i
think
it's
nob
of
the
case
rather
than
the
stage
at
which
it
occurs
and
campaign
clean
water
tells
us
that
we
really
shouldn't
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
harsha
amendments
which
i
have
described
in
which
were
supposed
to
give
discretion
to
the
president,
the
amendments
to
section
205(a)
and
207
because
he
says
they
are
a
considerable
monkey
wrench
thrown
into
the
statute
in
order
to
achieve
a
political
compromise
with
the
president
and
of
course,
ultimately
they
were
used
to
achieve
the
gathering
of
votes
to
override
the
president's
veto.
and
it's
important
to
remember
at
this
stage
when
you
address
the
question
of
what
the
discretion
is,
what
the
fight
was
about?
there
was
no
fight
about
the
president's
discretion
not
to
squander
money
if
he
found
it
couldn't
be
spent
advantageously
on
sewage
treatment
facilities.
he
has
the
power
to
refuse
to
spend
money
in
a
wasteful
fashion
under
the
anti-deficiency
act
already.
there
was
no
reason
to
put
that
kind
of
discretion
into
the
statute.
what
the
fight
was
about,
what
the
veto
message
was
about,
and
what
the
fight
in
congress
was
about
was
the
president's
authority
to
withhold
spending,
withhold
obligation
or
withhold
allotments,
whichever
stage
you
put
in
that
for
fiscal
policy
reasons
as
well
as
program
reasons.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it's
in
the
--
in
the
joint
appendix
mr.
justice
stewart
in
brown
book
and
it's
--
well,
i
trust
that
it's
in
the
record
and
i'm
sure
it's,
i
will.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we
can
check
while
we're
doing
it.
the
--
and
i
would
point
out
that
when
congress
respond
before
the
veto,
when
congress
was
explaining
these
amendments,
the
harsha
amendments,
when
they
were
talking
about
it
and
before
the
veto,
representative
harsha
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
i
will
not
quote
a
language
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
he
was
quite
clear
that
the
language
said
that
the
president
can
appropriate
and
can
spend
anything,
up
to
the
sum
but
not
to
exceed
the
sum
of
five
and
six
billion
dollars
for
those
two
years.
and
senator
cooper,
who
was
a
senate
conferee
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
specifically
said,
that
the
president
have
the
responsibility
for
evaluating
the
program
needs
in
relation
to
other
national
pre
--
priorities
which
certainly
means
the
president
has
a
power
to
make
a
trade
off
between
a
variety
of
priorities.
after
the
veto,
senator
harsha
–-
representative
harsha
came
back
again
and
in
urging
the
house
to
override
the
veto,
he
said,
“we
have
emphasized
over
and
over
again
that
if
federal
spending
must
be
curtailed
and
if
such
spending
cuts
must
affect
water
pollution
control
authorizations,
the
administration
can
impound
the
money,”
that's
on
page
20
of
our
brief,
and
on
page
21,
we
quote
representative
clawson,
another
conferee
who
says
repeatedly
that
if
the
president
must
hold
the
reigns
on
the
federal
budget,
these
amendments,
this
discretion
gives
him
the
power
to
hold
the
reigns
on
the
federal
budget,
and
the
statutory
language
itself
of
course
contains
no
restriction
upon
the
author
--
upon
discretion
authorized.
the
congress
could've
written
a
different
statute,
it
can
still
write
a
different
statute
but
this
is
the
one
we
have,
and
i
think
it
would
be
quite
wrong,
it's
quite
wrong
i
think
for
the
respondents
to
ask
that
that
discretion
which
is
clearly
in
the
legislative
history
which
is
clearly
in
the
statute
itself,
should
be
excised
by
courts
on
the
theory
that
they
want
to
forward
the
goal
of
clean
water,
that
is
to
be
--
if
their
process
had
to
be
speed
it
up,
that's
a
process
can
be
work
out
between
the
president
and
the
congress.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
at
the
stage
of
the
process
at
which
discretion
occurs.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
they
want
to
cut
it
down
to
-–
it's
very
odd
mr.
justice
white,
to
see
for
example
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
the
discretion
that
is
suggested
right
in
the
campaign
clean
water
brief.
one
is
told
really
only
that
the
discretion
may
not
be
authorized,
may
not
be
exercised
in
a
way
that
when
in
anyway
jeopardized
the
goals
of
the
program
and
the
deadlines
of
the
program.
well,
let's
that's
to
say
that
there
is
almost
no
discretion
and
is
to
say
that
these
congressmen
who
said
that
if
the
federal
budget
and
the
demands
of
fiscal
policy
re-encountered
to
the
expenditure
of
all
of
these
funds
then
the
president
had
the
authority
to
protect
the
federal
spending
levels
by
cutting
back
on
the
water
program.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
the
city
of
new
york
thinks
that
except
for
program-related
reasons,
not
federal
fiscal
policy
reasons
that
the
money
must
be
obligated.
the
discretion
occurs
at
the
obligation
stage
but
i
think
they
have
a
quite
narrow
view
of
what
the
discretion
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
major
gulf
between
the
government
and
both
of
these
respondents
is
the
scope
of
the
discretion,
and
i
think
that's
the
nob
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
the
time.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
scope,
i
think
the
statute
is
clear
on
the
time,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
the
scope
is
what
counts
and
i
think
the
scope
is
quite
clear
from
the
way
these
amendments
were
used
to
overwrite
the
presidential
veto
on
the
fiscal
considerations
and
it
was
explicitly
said
that
these
amendments
give
him
control
if
he
thinks
the
spending
is
too
high.
the
total
spending
not
the
spending
related
to
this
particular
program.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
think
the
–-
as
i
mentioned,
mr.
justice
powell,
we
felt
that
the
statute
clearly
places
at
the
allotment
stage
and
if
we
didn't
come
up
to
this
court
with
that,
that
we
could
get
--
whipsawed
it
by
a
later
court
saying,
you've
already
allotted,
now
your
discretion
is
gone.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
this
-–
if
i
understand
the
issue,
mr.
justice
powell,
if
this
court
for
example,
were
to
write
an
opinion,
saying
that
the
discretion
operates
contrary
to
our
submission
at
the
obligation
stage
rather
than
the
allotment
stage,
it
would
make
almost
no
difference.
but
the
question
of
what
that
discretion
is
and
whether
it
is
reviewable
by
a
court
putting
itself
in
the
position
of
the
president
and
looking
at
the
program,
the
size
of
the
budget
at
that
time,
the
other
competing
national
priorities
at
stake,
and
making
a
balance
and
saying
no
that
a
reasonable
president
would
have
spent
more.
that
is
the
nob
of
this
case.
that
is
what
we
think
is
the
political
question.
congress
gave
this
discretion,
the
president
has
exercised
it
and
we
think
it
violates
the
political
question
doctrine.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
not
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
not
the
only
issue,
mr.
justice
white,
in
campaign
clean
water,
the
fourth
circuit
repealed
and
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
trial
de
novo
of
the
president's
exercise
of
its
discretion.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
wouldn't
care
much
if
this
court
told
me
which
stage
is
was
at,
mr.
justice
white,
but
if
the
lower
court
did,
then
i
would
be
in
the
position
of
perhaps
getting
caught
by
a
court
in
a
different
jurisdiction
disagreeing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
--
that
i
think
is
the
real
nob
of
this
case,
and
i
think
that
the
statute
itself
on
its
phase
is
an
unconfined
discretion
and
the
variety
of
congressional
expressions.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
will
say
only
about
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
that
brief
proves
in
our
opinion
mathematically
that
the
new
act
does
not
affect
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
–-
allow
me
please
to
explain
this
supplemental
brief
in
these
problems.
i
was
informed
that
the
city
of
new
york
had
been
served
to
page
group
last
thursday
and
i
hope
that
had
been.
the
only
purpose
of
that
supplemental
brief
was
to
quiet
any
concern
that
this
case
might
have
become
moot
by
the
new
statute.
that
brief
is
really
not
in
discussion
here
because
it's
quite
clear
whatever
view
one
takes
of
the
new
statute,
these
deferrals
would
not
become
moot
unless
congress
took
some
further
action
which
it
has
not
taken.
on
the
question
of
discretion,
which
i
think
is
the
main
question
we
all
agree
we
have
before
us,
i
wish
to
point
--
i
did
point
out,
that
if
the
discretion
is
as
broad
as
the
congressman
repeatedly
said
it
was
in
getting
the
votes
to
override
the
veto,
then
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
judge
to
place
himself
in
the
position
of
a
president
balancing
the
budget
or
trying
to
control
inflation
and
make
the
choices,
but
i
think
it's
worth
saying
something
else,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
congress
said
that
the
president,
“spend
this
money
unless
you
think
inflation
is
getting
out
of
hand
or
other
priorities
are
more
important,
but
we'd
like
you
to
spend
this
money
unless
you
find
something
like
that.”
it
seems
to
me
at
that
point
you
have
a
political
judgment
in
the
classical
sense
by
the
president
and
for
a
court
to
try
to
apply
its
standards
to
how
that
judgment
should
have
been
made
would
be
a
classic
violation
of
the
political
question
doctrine.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
at
that
stage.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
campaign
clean
water
attempts
to
give
us
a
narrower
form
of
review
which
is
a
former
review
about
can
the
program
go
forward
effectively
with
this
kind
of
withholding
of
funds.
and
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
that
former
review
is
also
has
a
spurious
attractiveness.
what
the
president
has
the
authority
to
do
is
to
make
a
cost-benefit
analysis
under
the
anti-deficiency
act
or
inherently
of
whether
spending
more
funds
this
year
rather
than
next
would
merely
inflate
the
cost
of
the
resources
and
whether
it's
worth
it.
and
that
too
is
a
kind
of
discretion,
and
i
think
it
would
be
quite
difficult
for
our
court
to
review
because
it's
a
cost-benefit
analysis.
and
the
president
is
saying
is
20%
more
dollars
worth
10%
more
output
are
not.
so,
i
think
that
is
an
executive
kind
of
decision
which
will
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
review.
but
in
any
case,
the
deadlines
in
the
act,
it
is
now
quite
clear
probably
cannot
be
met
even
if
all
of
this
money
were
spent.
the
administrator
has
reported
to
congress
that
far
from
$18
billion,
the
act's
objectives
are
going
to
require
$340
to
$350
billion.
so,
i
think
were
not
realistically
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
i
am
--
i
am
informed
that
the
administrator
of
omb
has
reported
to
congress
that
the
total
needs
for
water
purification
in
this
country
are
going
to
amount
to
all
over
$300
billion.
so,
that
i
think
we
are
not
and
i
think
there's
going
to
be
trouble
with
these
deadlines
no
matter
what
happens
and
the
appropriate
thing
for
these
states
to
do
is
to
apply
for
rule
making
procedures
because
the
administrator
controls
the
standards
which
must
be
met
by
the
deadlines
and
if
they
cannot
meet
those
standards,
then
there's
a
--
there's
a
mechanism
in
the
act
by
which
that
can
be
accommodated.
one
thing
that
can't
be
changed
is
that
this
act
was
sole
to
congress
and
the
president's
veto
overwritten
on
a
view
of
discretion
which
included
discretion
to
control
total
spending
and
not
just
discretion
with
relation
to
the
effectiveness
of
this
program.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
problem
was
vastly
under
estimated.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
nobody
knew
it
that
time.
i
--
one
hopes
that
the
later
estimates
become
progressively
more
accurate
except
for
the
amounts
involved,
one
would
hope
that
but
that
the
sums
apparently
are
much
larger
than
were
anticipated
and
i
think
those
deadlines
of
the
statutes
would
not
be
met
if
this
money
were
paid
out.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
precisely
what
i
think
should
happen,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
could
be
put
either
in
the
form
of
non-reviewable
or
in
the
form
of
congress
intended
it
to
be
this
broad
and
therefore
there
is
no
function.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
to
be
served.
and
i
think
the
latter
of
this
case
although
i
think
it
is
also
non-reviewable.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
true.
i
suggest
that
i
think
it
was
given
in
such
a
broad
fashion
that
reviewable
or
not
there
is
really
nothing
wrong
has
happened
here.
but
secondly,
i
think
if
one
began
to
review
it,
that
one
would
immediately
be
into
an
area
where
there
are
no
standards
for
the
courts
to
apply,
and
the
court
would
essentially
be
making
the
judgment
to
this
reserve
for
the
executive
in
our
form
of
government.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
--
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
an
executive
with
delegated
authority
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
only
standards
that
are
apparent
in
the
legislative
history,
they
are
non-apparent
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it's
an
unbounded
discretion.
the
only
standard
which
are
apparent
in
the
legislative
history
are
to
control
federal
spending
because
of
inflationary
pressures.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
that
would
not
prevent
the
administrator
from
inviting
rule
making
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
was
suggesting
as
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
if
those
figures
are
accurate,
then
the
expenditures
sums
from
this
case
is
going
to
have
very
little
to
do
in
general
with
the
meeting
of
deadlines,
and
the
standards
