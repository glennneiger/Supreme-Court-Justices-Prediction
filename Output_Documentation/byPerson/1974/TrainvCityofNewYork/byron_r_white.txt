justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
something
isn't
allotted
here
about
the
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
whether
they
are
about
to
plan
anything,
except
beyond
whatever
is
allotted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
have
allotted
something
they
may
plan
knowing
perfectly
will,
they
are
going
to
have
to
submit
the
plans
that
will
get
by.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
beyond
their
allotment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
this
was
a
unique
or
well,
a
unique
way
of
going
about
appropriating
or
making
funds
available,
different
from
the
ordinary
budget
or
budgetary
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
difference
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
that
pretty
usual
of
authorizing
this
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
says
more
than
they
may
have
eventually
appropriate?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
whatever
this
view
now
say
that
whatever
discretion
executive
got
and
doesn't
go
–-
that
doesn't
extend
to
deciding
that
the
x
million
or
billion
dollars
will
not
be
spent
at
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
the
--
they
(inaudible)
themselves
and
i
thought
that
just
disagreed
on
as
to
when.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
points
don't
say
the
discretion
of
the
excised,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
yes
that
as
you
presently
view
the
act
in
terms
of
whether
the
$18
billion
custody
allotted
at
sometime,
do
you
say
that
the
(inaudible)
must
be
continued
at
the
city
of
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
major
difference
with
the
major
gulf
between
you
and
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
scope?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
only
issue
that
we
thought
that
was
presented
with
justice
frankfurter's
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
only
issue
were
to
finding,
there
wouldn't
be
much
to
argue
about.
you
wouldn't
really
care
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
thompson,
do
you
--
do
you
think
there's
any
difference
between
you
and
the
solicitor
general
other
than
the
timing
of
the
discretion?
do
you
think
there's
some
difference
between
you
and
him
with
respect
to
the
scope?
or
have
you
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
seem
to
concede,
there
are
some
discretion
sometimes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
unfair
question
but
do
you
concede
that
at
the
commitment
stage,
the
obligation
stage,
there
is
discretion
to
refuse,
to
obligate
because
the
executive
does
not
want
to
spend
money
that
fast?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
wouldn't
think
that
the
-–
what
the
executive
allots,
he
cannot
later
at
the
obligation
stage
say,
“we're
spending
money
too
fast”?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
be
very,
very
broad
and
still
be
reviewable
or
it
could
be
relatively
narrow
as
you
point
out
and
still
--
and
still
be
non-reviewable.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
think
the
deal
is
to
when,
when
you
said
that
was
only
at
the
--
at
the
obligation
stage
then
we
wouldn't
be
reversing
the
new
york
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
affirm
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
1972
amendments
to
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
authorize
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
allot
to
the
state
up
to
the
amount
--
sums
of
money
up
to
the
amounts
specified
in
the
act
for
the
years
covered
by
the
provisions
of
the
act.
those
funds
allotted
thereafter
become
available
for
commitment
for
approved
sewage
treatment
projects.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
administrator
has
the
authority
to
postpone
allotments
or
to
allot
to
the
states
less
than
the
total
amounts
authorized
under
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
the
administrator
had
no
such
discretion.
for
the
reasons
that
we
given
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
court
--
or
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
douglas
concurs
in
the
result.
