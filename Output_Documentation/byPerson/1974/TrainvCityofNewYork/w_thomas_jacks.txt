mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
my
argument
on
an
agreeable
note.
i'll
begin
agreeing
with
general
bork
when
he
said
that
he
thinks
the
scope
of
the
discretion
is
at
the
knob
of
this
case,
i
agree.
my
client
campaign
clean
water
is
in
some
respects
i
suppose
at
the
middle
of
the
road
in
this
case,
where
flunk
on
one
hand
with
the
city
of
new
york
which
takes
the
position
that
the
administrator
has
absolutely
no
discretion
to
withhold
funding
at
the
allotment
stage.
on
the
other
hand,
were
flunked
by
the
administrator
of
epa,
who
claims
that
he
has
unbounded
discretion
to
withhold
allotments
as
mr.
--
as
general
bork
pointed
out
in
turning
to
the
language
of
representative
harsha
on
the
floor
that
they
can
allot
anything
up
to
the
$18
billion,
at
least
initially.
we
take
what
i
think
is
a
more
reasonable
view
of
the
statute
than
either
of
this
that
is
that,
yes
there
is
some
discretion
intended
at
the
allotment
stage
that
that
discretion
is
limited
and
we
think
was
abused
in
this
situation.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
yes
sir,
we
do.
we
do.
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
no.
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
well,
we
think
our
reading
of
the
statute
and
legislative
history,
we
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
discretion
was
intended
to
be
exercised
at
the
allotment
stage
because
it
was
the
section
of
allotments
and
not
the
section
on
obligations
that
was
amended.
they
could've
just
as
easily
changed
the
mandatory
language
in
section
203
on
obligations
that
to
be
discretion
if
they'd
wanted
to
let
the
administrator
exercise
his
discretion
there.
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
i
believe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
i'd
like
to
focus
primarily
on
the
question,
this
afternoon,
of
how
do
we
know
that
the
administrator's
discretion
was
intended
to
be
limited.
and
how
do
we
gauge
where
those
limitations
lie.
i
think
perhaps
the
principal
point
of
departure
between
campaign
clean
water
and
the
administrator
is
over
what
interpretive
tools
the
court
relies
on
in
determining
whether
there
is
discretion,
whether
there
are
limitations
on
the
discretion
and
where
the
limitations
lie.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
argument
pointed
primarily
to
the
floor
language,
the
remarks
of
representative
harsha,
and
said
it's
from
this
that
congress
intended
to
give
discretion
notwithstanding
the
remainder
of
the
statute.
the
solicitor
general
would
have
this
court
look
more
to
what
was
done
in
the
11th
hour
in
this
statute
and
accuses
us
of
ignoring
this
floor
language.
i
suppose
we
would
accuse
the
administrator
of
ignoring
the
entire
remainder
of
the
statute.
i
think
it's
useful
in
answering
the
question
how
do
you
know
what
the
limitations
are
to
do
two
things.
first,
to
take
a
general
overview
of
what
went
on
here,
of
what
went
on
in
the
congress
over
this
two-year
period
during
which
the
statute
was
pending.
i
think
it's
useful
secondly
to
look
at
some
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
statute
and
just
ask,
what
do
these
provisions
mean?
are
they
still
effective
if
the
administrator's
view
is
upheld,
that
his
discretion
is
virtually
unbounded?
first,
the
overview,
the
statute
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
was
two
years
in
the
making.
it
was
very
carefully
constructed.
from
the
beginning,
the
proponents
of
this
statute
sought
to
eliminate
completely
the
discharges
of
pollution
into
our
nation's
waters
and
to
do
so
in
accordance
with
the
prescribed
time
table.
they
were
fought
at
every
step
of
the
way
by
the
executive
branch,
by
the
administration.
the
administration
opposed
the
level
of
funding;
the
administration
opposed
the
contract
authority
mechanism
of
funding;
the
administration
opposed
having
a
rigid
deadlines;
it
opposed
having
mandatory
enforcement
provisions.
despite
this
opposition,
the
bill
was
submitted
to
the
congress,
was
passed.
the
president
as
what
his
constitutional
prerogative
vetoed
it,
and
he
listed
as
his
chief
reason
the
level
of
spending
called
for.
he
would've
suggested
a
lower
level
of
spending.
the
bill
was
returned
to
the
congress
and
the
veto
was
overwritten
and
was
overwritten
overwhelmingly
in
both
houses,
and
during
the
course
of
the
debates
on
the
veto
override,
people
on
both
side
of
the
aisle,
the
democrat
senator
muskie,
the
republican
representative
harsha
all
agreed
that
congress
was
dictating
that
the
job
be
done,
that
they
knew
it
was
expensive,
they
knew
it
would
tax
the
nation's
resources
to
some
extent
but
that
congress
had
made
that
decision.
the
question,
i
think,
we've
got
to
ask
in
taking
this
overview
is,
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
in
making
this
last
minute
change
to
achieve
what
was
essentially
a
political
compromise
and
it's
attempt
to
avoid
the
veto,
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
in
making
that
change,
the
congress
intended
to
eviscerate
the
remainder
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
answer
is
going
to
be
clearly
not,
and
yet
i
think
if
you
turn
to
some
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
statute,
you'll
find
that
that
would
indeed
be
the
effect.
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
it
doesn't
give
me
much
satisfaction,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
under
the
statute,
there
was
a
timeframe
intended
as
well
as
an
intent
as
to
the
job
to
be
done.
in
other
words,
congress
intended
not
only
that
the
nation's
waters
be
cleaned
up,
but
that
they'd
be
cleaned
up
in
accordance
with
the
prescribed
schedule,
so
it
doesn't
give
me
much
comfort
when
the
solicitor
general
tells
us,
“don't
worry,
were
going
to
release
the
entire
$18
billion,
were
just
not
going
to
tell
you
when
we're
going
to
do
it.”
that
doesn't
give
me
much
comfort
when
i
have
to
look
at
title
iii
of
the
statute
and
i
see
that
under
title
iii,
there
are
two
deadlines.
one
is
that
by
1977,
municipalities
must
achieve
a
secondary
level
of
treatment;
the
other
is
that
by
1983,
they
must
achieve
-–
their
plans
must
feature
the
best
practicable
technology.
that
gives
me
problems.
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
no
sir,
it
does
not
because
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
new
budget
control
act
which
became
effective
on
july
12,
1974,
doesn't
apply,
at
least
not
right
now,
to
the
impoundment
actions
which
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
that
his
construction
of
that
statute
is
correct,
when
he
says
that
the
triggering
action
by
the
executive
must
be
one
which
was
commenced
after
july
12,
1974.
i
don't
think
the
congress
can
do
anything
really
about
this,
at
least
not
right
now,
and
at
some
point
in
the
future,
he
may--
the
administrator
may
take
some
further
action,
which
would
trigger
the
provisions
of
that
statute.
but
i
have
to
believe
we
have
to
allow
that.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
clearly
--
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
clearly,
when
we're
dealing
with
the
congress.
they
can
do
pretty
nearly
anything
they
want
to
within
the
limitations
of
the
constitution
and
at
anytime
they
want
to.
i
don't
think
that
we,
as
litigants,
should
be
forced
to
rely
on
the
hope
that
if
sometime
in
the
future,
congress
is
going
to
bail
us
out,
when
congress
has
already
said
i
think
pretty
clearly
what
it
intends
to
be
done.
that
would
be
our
position
really
on
that
statute.
i
think
not
only
-–
let
me
look
--
let
me
spend
one
more
minute
on
this
question
of
the
deadlines.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
to
a
survey
that
was
done
by
epa
last
year,
their
1973
needs
survey,
which
was
prepared
pursuant
to
the
statute
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
that
survey,
epa
concluded
that
-–
and
i'll
speak
here
for
the
state
of
virginia
since
that's
the
state
i
know
best,
that's
where
my
group
came
from.
they
said
virginia
is
going
to
need
$650
million
roughly
just
to
meet
the
1977
deadline,
just
to
meet
that
secondary
treatment
deadline
in
1977.
now,
75%
of
that
of
course
should
come
from
the
federal
government
under
this
legislation
that
will
be
about
$489
million.
if
virginia
had
gotten
all
of
the
sums
that
was
--
that
were
authorized
for
fiscal
‘73,
‘74,
and
‘75,
it
would've
had
slightly
more
than
enough.
there
would've
been
slightly
more
than
enough
federal
money
to
enable
virginia
to
meet
that
‘77
deadline.
as
it
is
with
the
withholding
of
55%
of
the
funding
for
the
first
two
fiscal
years,
virginia
has
gotten
$243
million
rather
than
the
$489
million
in
federal
money
they
need
just
to
meet
that
deadline.
in
other
words,
even
if
you
take
epa's
own
estimates
of
what
construction
needs
are
to
comply
with
the
statute,
it's
clear
were
in
trouble.
i
think
another
specific
provision
of
this
statute
that
is
instructed
and
one
that
has
been
addressed
to
some
extent
already
this
afternoon
is
the
contract
authority
provisions
of
title
ii
of
the
act.
those
provisions
are
relevant
because
when
you
study
the
legislative
history,
it's
clear
that
congress
intended
in
enacting
this
advance
funding
mechanism,
to
give
municipalities
and
states
the
opportunity
to
plan
ahead,
so
that
they
would
know
and
looking
several
years
now
on
the
road,
what
federal
money
they
could
expect
and
can
plan
accordingly.
now,
when
the
administrator
construes
his
authority
under
the
act,
to
mean
that
he
can
make
an
initial
allotment
in
whatever
amount
he
pleases
and
then
can
dole
out
further
allotments
from
time
to
time,
from
year
to
year
as
he
sees
fit,
i
think
it's
clear
that
that
entirely
frustrates
that
very
carefully
contrived
legislative
scheme.
i
think
then
that
when
one
studies
the
entire
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
when
one
looks
at
the
deadlines
provisions,
when
one
looks
at
the
contract
authority
provisions,
it
becomes
clear
that
congress
must
have
intended
some
limitation
on
the
discretion
the
administrator
was
being
given
leave
to
exercise.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
these
are
far
more
useful
tools
than
merely
turning
to
representative
harsha
in
saying
that
he
said
we
didn't
do
anything
up
to
that
amount.
i
think,
it's
far
more
useful
and
it's
indeed
in
accordance
with
general
rules
of
statutory
construction
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
entirety
of
the
statute
and
ask
the
question,
does
it
make
sense
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
administrator
unfettered
discretion
in
light
of
what
that
would
do
to
the
remainder
of
the
statute.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
believe,
i've
concluded.
thank
you.
mr.
w.
thomas
jacks
we
certainly
shall,
your
honor.
