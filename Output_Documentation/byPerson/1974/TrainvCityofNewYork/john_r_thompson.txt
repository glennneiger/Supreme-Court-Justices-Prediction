mr.
john
r.
thompson
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
well,
these
are
two
--
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
two
very
separate
cases
because
they
were
consolidated
by
the
court
on
the
grant
of
certiorari,
we
have
agreed
with
the
respondents
in
the
other
case,
the
clean
--
campaign
clean
water
case
to
divide
our
time,
i
will
attempt
to
stay
within
the
15
minutes
which
i
had
originally
planned
on
for
the
city
of
new
york.
the
--
as
we
see
it,
the
issue
in
this
case,
in
the
new
york
city
case,
it
is
very
different
–-
it's
very
definitely
the
timing
at
which
any
kind
of
executive
control
over
the
rate
of
spending
is
to
be
exercised,
not
the
scope
of
the
discretion.
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
shows
clearly
and
unmistakably
that
the
harsha
amendments
and
whatever
control
they
gave
the
executive
over
the
rate
of
spending
was
not
to
be
operative
at
the
allotment
stage.
thus,
full
allotments
were
required
to
be
made
by
congress
after
the
harsha
amendments
as
they
were
before
the
harsha
amendments.
whatever
discretion
was
conferred
by
the
harsha
amendments
or
confirmed
by
the
harsha
amendments,
over
the
rate
of
spending,
was
to
be
operative
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
decided
only
at
the
obligational
stage.
now
at
-–
in
point
one
of
our
brief,
at
pages
8
to
17,
we
have
summarized
that
part
of
the
legislative
history
which
goes
to
the
time
at
which
whatever
the
discretion
is,
the
time
at
which
it
should
be
exercised,
and
we
believed
that
it
is
far
clearer
than
the
solicitor
general
would
have
you
believe.
let
me
back
up
just
a
minute.
the
legislative
history
of
the
harsha
amendments
shows
two
strands,
if
you
will,
two
interwoven
strands.
one
does
show
as
the
government
maintains
that
the
objective,
the
overall
objective
of
those
harsha
amendments
was
in
the
words
of
several
of
the
legislation
sponsors
to
emphasize
the
flexibility
of
the
president's
control
over
the
rate
of
spending.
we
do
not
--
we
have
no
difference
with
the
government
that
that
was
the
overall
objective
where
we
differ
with
the
government
is
as
to
when
that
control,
whatever
its
scope
was
to
be
exercised.
in
it's
brief,
the
government
had
virtually
ignored
the
legislative
history
going
to
the
second
strand
as
to
when
it
should
be
exercised,
but
included
in
our
--
in
the
materials,
in
point
one
of
our
brief,
are
statements
by
sponsors
of
the
act
in
both
houses,
both
before
and
after
the
veto
message
which
we
believe
clearly
show
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
deciding
that
congress
intended
that
discretion
to
be
exercised
only
at
the
obligational
stage.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
that
was
raised
by
questions
from
your
honor
and
from
justices
black
and
blackmun
--
white
and
blackmun.
the
function
of
allotment
essentially
in
this
so-called
contract
authority
funding,
the
main
function
of
allotment
is
to
give
the
states
and
their
political
subdivisions
a
justification
for
going
ahead
with
the
very
intricate
planning
for
all
of
the
vast
construction
which
congress
intended
to
induce
the
states
to
perform
in
order
to
clean
up
the
waters
of
the
country
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
now,
there's
a
statement
which
is
quoted
almost
in
full
at
page
23
of
our
brief
by
representative
harsha
on
that
planning
process,
it
is
-–
it
indicates
several
things,
first
of
all,
how
important
the
planning
process
was
to
those
who
conceived
and
labored
and
drafted
the
statute.
secondly,
it
showed
that
they
were
interested
not
in
bits
and
pieces,
stop
and
go
planning
as
various
amounts
of
money
might
be
allotted
and
allotted
and
allotted
under
the
government's
theory.
they
had
in
mind
and
mr.
harsha
emphasized
coordinated
long
range
planning,
so
that
any
locality
that
was
a
beneficiary
of
title
ii,
would
be
able
to
plan
whatever
its
share
was
of
$18
billion
worth
of
projects.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
not
only
a
position,
your
honor,
where
you
can
plan
but
you
may
even
not
be
able
to
plan
as
a
local
official
unless
you
have
some
kind
of
ticket
from
the
government,
some
kind
of
go
ahead,
something
you
can
point
to,
to
the
rest
of
your
bureaucracy,
to
your
city
council,
your
older
men,
what
ever
happens
to
be
and
to
your
constituents,
who
were
also
affected
by
this
to
the
people,
that
same
statement
on
page
23
of
the
brief,
in
that
same
statement,
mr.
harsha
mentions
a
kind
of
things
that
are
included
in
the
planning
process
and
there
are
a
lot
more
than
just
simply
drawing
up
engineering
and
architectural
plans
and
specifications,
long
as
that
takes
and
difficult
is
that
is,
he
mentions
planning
generally,
by
which
i
take
that
he
meant
community
planning
deciding
where
these
--
where
these
various
plants
and
collection
systems,
i
might
add,
where
they
will
be
located?
how
they
will
be
fitted
in
with
other
capital
projects
of
that
municipality?
he
mentioned
site
acquisition,
he
mentioned
feasibility
studies,
and
he
mentioned
getting
authorization
for
any
necessary
bonds
that
had
to
be
sold
under
the
statute
while
the
federal
government
is
putting
up
a
great
deal
of
money,
the
states
and
localities
have
put
up
one
quarter
which
comes
to
$6
billion
and
it's
not
easy
these
days
or
any
day
perhaps
for
states
and
localities
to
raise
their
proportionate
share
of
that.
that
has
to
be
coordinated
with
their
other
needs.
it
is
a
fast
--
it
is
a
fast
undertaking
to
make
a
coordinated
plan
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
word
to
--
for
our
projects
that
would
be
able
to
qualify
for
the
federal
grants
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
was
--
that
if
one
remembers
the
function,
the
main
function
of
allotment
to
lay
a
basis
for
the
cities
and
towns
to
go
ahead
and
engage
in
that
planning
process,
then
it
becomes
clear
that
absent
any
specific
congressional
intent,
otherwise,
that
the
only
discretion
to
allot
less
--
the
only
discretion
conveyed,
conferred
or
emphasized
in
the
harsha
amendments,
applied
not
to
allotment,
full
allotments
had
to
be
made,
it
applied
that
the
obligation
stage.
and
in
the
course
of
our
point
one,
we
point
to
a
statement
by
mr.
harsha
in
which
he
said,
he
talked
about
the
obligation
stage,
at
which
after
the
full
planning
of
a
project
has
taken
place,
and
it
is
reviewed
by
the
administrator,
reviewed
certainly
for
compliance
with
these
conditions
in
the
statute
and
perhaps
we
would
–-
for
new
york
we
would
can
see
this,
perhaps
also
for
some
fiscal
considerations,
at
that
point
,
is
from
the
administrator
by
approval
would
either
subject
the
united
states
to
an
obligation
to
pay
that
grant
or
by
holding
it
up
by
non-approval,
he
would
not
subject
the
united
states
to
that
obligation.
it
is
that
point
after
all
of
the
planning
that
we
believe
under
appropriate
circumstances,
the
executive
could
impose
what
might
be
called
the
hold
on
either
a
certain
type
of
projects
or
otherwise.
that
would
be
the
point
right
before
the
united
states
became
obligated,
but
at
any
rate
at
that
point,
when
the
united
states
wanted
to
exercise
the
flexibility,
the
act
talks
about,
when
the
fiscal
stringency
had
vanished,
if
you
will,
the
plans
would
all
up
been
made,
you
would
have
a
shelf
full
of
plans
on
the
top,
so
to
speak
could
be
turned
on.
that
we
think
is
much
more
consistent
with
the
underlying
intent
of
congress
that
this
was
a
massive
ambitious
program
and
they
wanted
it
done
just
as
fast
as
it
could
possibly
be
done.
the
allotments
you'll
notice
were
said
to
be
--
the
allotments
were
to
be
made
no
later
than
particular
dates.
the
first
date
was
no
later
than
30
days
after
enactment
of
the
act.
the
second
allotment
for
the
fiscal
--
for
the
next
fiscal
year
came
along
six
weeks
thereafter.
and
the
final
allotment
was
to
be
six
months
before
the
fiscal
year
for
which
it
was
being
made.
almost
at
the
earliest
possible
stage
congress
wanted
these
allotments
made.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
i
have
never
heard
this
until
today
seen
any
indication
from
the
government
is
to
exactly
how
broad
they
thought
the
discretion
was.
i
--
that
has
been,
in
our
view
of
this
case,
of
our
case
that
isn't
easy
question
which
is
not
before
the
court,
how
much,
how
wide
the
discretion
is,
mr.
justice
renhquist.
it's
a
difficult
question
left
open
by
the
fact
that
in
my
view
at
any
rate,
the
statute
does
not
clearly
delineate
that.
it
looks
to
me
from
references
that
representative
harsha
made
to
the
procedure,
the
executive
was
then
following
in
the
-–
under
the
federal
highway
act,
which
was
later
held
to
be
improper
by
the
eighth
circuit
but
the
references
that
representative
harsha
made
to
that,
it
seems
to
me
in
all
honesty
that
some
discretion
would
lodge
at
the
obligation
stage
in
the
executive
beyond
just
the
criteria
which
are
in
the
act
which
are
environmental
engineering
and
financial.
but
as
i
say
that
isn't
easy
question
because
of
this
and
it
might
have
to
be
settled
in
future
litigation,
although
i
think
that
has
become
much
less
likely
since
this
new
budget
act
of
1974,
which
now
provides
for
quite
a
clear
way
in
which
congress
and
the
president
can
work
cooperatively.
if
this
court
should
declare,
should
affirm
and
thereby
declare
that
the
full
allotments
had
to
be
made,
and
then
perhaps
adding
that
the
harsha
amendments
conferred
some
discretion
at
the
obligation
stage,
then
the
president
would
presumably
make
the
obligation
–-
make
the
allotments,
then
at
the
later
stage
if
it
should
be
desirable
for
the
-–
if
the
president
and
his
administrator
should
think
it
desirable
to
put
a
hold
on
the
obligation
of
funds,
that
action
would
be
subject
to
the
new
budget
act.
the
president
would
have
to
submit
a
special
message
to
congress,
he
would
propose
that
deferral
and
the
deferral
would
be
effective
for
the
rest
of
that
fiscal
year
unless
either
house
of
congress
adopted
a
resolution
rejecting
disapproving
of
the
deferral.
it
provides
a
mechanism
for
which
we
have
not
had
before
for
cooperative
effort
between
these
two
parties.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
not
been
discussing
--
we
have
not
been
thinking
ourselves
except
the
academic
way
and
we
have
not
been
arguing
with
the
government
in
our
case
over
the
scope
of
the
obligation
-–
of
the
scope
of
the
discretion.
our
argument
is
always
been
the
government
had
said
they
had
complete
discretion
-–
complete
and
unreviewable
discretion
--
mr.
john
r.
thompson
now
that
--
and
now
they
also,
they
have
changed
their
positions
since
the
early
days
of
those
litigation
to
say
that
full
amount
of
the
$18
billion
must
be
allotted
sometime.
in
the
lower
courts,
they
took
the
position
that
the
harsha
amendments
that
they
didn't
have
to
allot
them
if
the
president
did
want
to
anytime,
now
they
say
they
have
to
be
allotted,
they
just
don't
say
exactly
when
they'll
do
it.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
i
don't
believe
that's
an
unfair
question
but
as
i
replied
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
be
--
there
would
be
gratuitous
answer
that
i
would
give
you.
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
and
whether
the
president
could
really
make
out
a
case
that
fiscal
needs
did
actually
require
it.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
it
certainly
we
--
excuse
me,
we
would
concede
that
there
was
a
measure
of
discretion.
we
don't
know
how
broad
that
would
be
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
--
i
certainly
wouldn't
be
in
the
position
to
say
that
it
would
just
-–
just
if
the
president
decided
overnight
for
some
whim,
that
suddenly
all
spending
should
stop
here.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
i
think
under
the
statute
that
certainly
would
authorize
it
and
then
as
indicated
under
the
budget
act
anyway
it
would
be
subject
if
we
were
getting
way
off
base
too
in
effect
to
correction
by
congress.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
by
resolution,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
r.
thompson
we
haven't
been
favored
with
the
copy
of
that
your
honor
but
--
mr.
john
r.
thompson
but
--
from
what
--
from
what
the
solicitor
general
said,
we
would
agree
with
it
with
one
caveat
that
this
proposed
deferral
of
allotments
has
been
included
in
the
special
message
that
the
president
sent
to
congress.
he
included
it
for
information
only,
saying
it
was
not
really
within
the
congress'
as
purview
under
the
new
act,
but
he
said
that
he
would
like
further
guidance.
now,
if
he
also
said
that
he
would
abide
by
the
decision
of
this
court,
on
the
legal
points
involved
here,
but
if
the
either
house
of
congress
taking
advantage
of
the
president's
submission
in
that
forum
should
pass
a
resolution
disapproving
of
the
further
deferral
of
allotments
of
the
unalloted
$9
billion,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
solicitor
general
would
promptly
advise
this
court
and
then
give
his
-–
give
the
government's
view
as
to
whether
they
then
agree
that
they
would
comply
with
what
congress
was
either
asking
or
ordering
them
to
do,
and
at
that
point
if
that
came
before
your
decision
in
this
case,
when
and
if
i
say
conceivably
that
could
alter
--
could
alter
the
situation.
thank
you
sir.
