yet
it's
not
an
uncommon
phenomenon,
is
it,
for
congress
to
authorize
a
substantially
more
money
for
a
given
project
than
it
ultimately
appropriate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
allotment
stage
is
unique
here
in
the
budgetary
process,
isn't
it
relevant
in
the
authorization
or
the
appropriation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fact
that
the
executive
doesn't
have
that
discretion
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
congress
will
ultimately
appropriate
all
the
money
that
is
now
authorized.

mr.
thompson,
do
you
think
that
the
administrator
under
your
theory,
his
discretion
is
confined
at
the
obligation
stage,
do
you
think
he
has
the
same
order
of
discretion
or
degree
of
discretion
at
that
stage
that
the
solicitor
general
contends
he
has
at
the
allocation
stage?
