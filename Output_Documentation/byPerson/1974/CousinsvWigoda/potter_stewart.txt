stewart
who
are
the
respondents?
justice
potter
stewart
the
delegates
themselves?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
with
democrats,
its
sure
will.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
whalen,
what
is
the
--
what's
the
federal
question
here?
what's
the
question
of
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
state
of
illinois.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
the
same
as
your
first
point
and
your
first
and
second.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
national
chamber
of
commerce
is
national
in
nature
and
the
state
presumably
can
interfere
with
the
right
of
those
people
to
associate.
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
federal
governmental
interest
that
is
there,
is
there?
their
private
associational
interest,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
court
of
appeals,
i
know
it
held
it
was
governmental.
justice
potter
stewart
your
basic
claim
is
that
the
state
of
illinois
through
this
injunction
has
interfered
with
your
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
right
of
association.
justice
potter
stewart
he
will
also
decide
whether
or
not
your
clients
are
going
to
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is
i
guess
that
the
federal
litigation
culminating
in
this
court's
stay
was
not
concerned
with
the
legality
under
illinois
law
of
your
slate
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
that
this
case
is
not
concerned
with
the
constitutional
legitimacy
of
the
democratic
party's
guidelines.
justice
potter
stewart
into
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
the
present
case,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
it's
virtually
conceded
that
your
clients
were
the
delegates
chosen
in
accordance
with
illinois
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
there's
a
--
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
--
the
basic
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
injunction
of
the
illinois
state
court
violated
the
petitioners'
constitutional
rights
of
free
association
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
an
issue
that
was
not
really
of
--
was
not
the
issue
in
the
previous
federal
litigation.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
point.
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is?
justice
potter
stewart
your
point,
i
gather
with
the
respect
to
the
reported
congressional
analogy
is
that
it
is
not
an
analogy
that's
your
not
complaining
at
all
here
of
the
convention's
refusal
to
sit
the
illinois
--
your
clients.
justice
potter
stewart
at
all,
that's
not
an
issue
here
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
also
raised
in
the
credentials
committee
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
you
told
us
early
i
thought
of
no
point
laboring
this
thing
very
long
that
the
judge
hart
precluded
consideration
of
that
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
no
question
of
illinois
laws
there
involved
in
other
words?
justice
potter
stewart
because
as
i
understand
it,
it's
not
even
an
argument.
it's
been
conceded
or
at
least
virtually
conceded
all
the
way
through,
all
of
this
litigation
that
your
adversary's
clients
are
the
delegates
who
were
elected
in
accord
with
illinois
law.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
argument.
