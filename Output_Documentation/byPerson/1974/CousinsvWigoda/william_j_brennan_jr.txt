justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
59
petitioners
include
any
of
the
59
respondents
who
elect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
next
file
reading?
if
the
illinois
law
is
cooperative,
i'll
take
it
that
it
would
be
another
primary
for
the
selection
of
the
delegates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
if
the
illinois
appellate
court
is
correct
and
then
under
illinois
law
there
would
be
another
election
where
they're
not
a
delegate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
respondents
act
as
delegates
only
until
they're
replace
under
illinois
law
by
another
election,
isn't
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
will
be
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
get
it
then
at
the
national
committee
men
suppose
is
filled
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
committee
woman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
did
the
--
did
the
national
committee
accept
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
elections
by
respondents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
assume
that
you
win
this
case,
what
will
happen
with
respect
to
the
national
committee
man
and
woman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
whalen,
may
i
just
interrupt
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
may
get
back
to
you
about
a
matter
of
the
committee
men
and
committee
women.
you
say
they
were
elected
by
the
59
respondents,
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
what
was
before
the
national
convention
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
after
the
national
convention.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
now
seated
by
the
national
committee
or
in
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
subject
to
challenge
before
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
has
the
national
committee
permitted
them
to
participate
in
national
committee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
subject
to
challenge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
is
the
committee
going
to
rule
on
the
challenge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
this
case
was
moot.
maybe,
i
hope
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
open
to
respondents
to
raise
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
petitioner's
slate
before
judge
hart
in
that
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
--
no,
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
open
to
you
to
raise
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
attempt
to
open
it,
to
raise
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
imply
the
lack
of
bona
fides
of
the
petitioner's
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then,
what
about
the
answer
to
this
question?
is
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
make
it
stick?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
wouldn't
seat
the
delegate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
appellate
court
of
the
state
of
illinois.
it
involves
a
contest
between
two
slates
of
delegates
who
sought
to
be
seated
as
the
delegation
from
chicago
to
the
1972
democratic
national
convention.
the
petitioners
who
are
called
the
cousins
delegates
challenged
before
the
national
democratic
party
credentials
committee
as
violative
of
party
guidelines
the
seating
of
the
respondents
called
the
wigoda
delegates
who
had
been
elected
from
chicago
districts
of
the
march
1972
illinois
primary
election
as
delegates
to
the
1972
democratic
national
convention
to
held
in
july
of
1972.
the
credential
committee
decided
that
the
petitioners,
that
is
the
cousins
delegates
should
be
seated
instead
of
the
respondents,
the
wigoda
delegates
selected
at
the
primary.
and
the
respondents
on
july
8,
1972,
two
days
before
the
convention
opened
obtained
an
injunction
from
the
illinois
circuit
court
enjoining
the
petitioners,
the
cousins
group
from
acting
as
delegates
at
the
convention.
the
cousins
delegates
are
nevertheless
were
seated
by
the
convention
and
they
functioned
as
delegates
throughout
and
in
consequence
proceedings
for
criminal
contempt
are
now
pending
against
them
in
the
illinois
courts.
the
illinois
appellate
court
affirmed
the
injunction
holding
that
the
right
to
seat
as
a
delegate
representing
illinois
at
the
national
nominating
convention
is
governed
exclusively
by
the
illinois
election
code
and
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
protecting
the
effective
right
to
participate
in
primaries
is
superior
to
whatever
other
interests
the
party
itself
might
wish
to
protect.
we
reverse
in
the
selection
of
candidates
for
national
office
a
national
party
convention
serves
the
pervasive
national
interest
which
is
paramount
to
any
interest
of
a
state
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
a
electoral
process
and
the
illinois
courts
therefore
erred
in
issuing
an
injunction
that
abridged
the
associational
rights
of
petitioners
and
their
party
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
thus,
this
is
a
case
where
the
convention
itself
was
the
proper
forum
for
determining
intraparty
disputes
as
to
which
delegate
should
be
seated.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
have
joined.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
