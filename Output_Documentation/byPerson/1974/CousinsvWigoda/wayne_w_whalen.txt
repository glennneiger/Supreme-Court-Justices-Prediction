mr.

whalen
72,
in
which
59
respondents
were
elected
as
delegates
to
the
1972
convention.
on
march
31,
1972,
10
petitioners
filed
the
challenge
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
democratic
national
party
contending
that
respondents
have
violated
national
party
rules.
and
that
they've
discriminated
invidiously
and
substantially
on
the
basis
of
race
against
women
and
young
people
and
that
they
had
held
secret
and
close
slate
making
meetings,
all
in
express
violation
of
the
national
party
rules.
on
april
19,
1972,
the
respondents
filed
the
complaint
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
alleging
that
respondents
because
they
were
elected
in
accordance
with
state
law,
were
the
only
delegates
who
could
be
seated
at
the
1972
convention.
petitioners
sought
to
remove
that
case
to
the
northern
district
of
illinois
federal
court.
the
motion
to
remand
the
case
was
granted
on
the
grounds
that
no
constitutional
or
federal
question
was
presented
by
the
case.
petitioners
also
sought
to
enjoin
the
action
in
the
state
court
pursuant
to
section
1983,
an
injunction
was
issued
for
time
but
was
subsequently
vacated
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
stay
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
was
denied
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
chambers.
pursuant
to
the
national
party
rules,
on
may
31,
june
1,
and
june
8,
1972,
hearings
were
held
in
chicago
at
which
both
respondents
and
petitioners
participated
presenting
argument,
filing
motions,
presenting
witnesses
and
documentary
evidence
all
before
a
hearing
examiner
appointed
by
the
democratic
national
committee,
mr.
cecil
f.
poole.
on
june
25,
1972,
mr.
poole
issued
a
report
in
which
he
upheld
the
allegations
of
petitioners
and
that
is
that
respondents
had
discriminated
invidiously
and
substantially
on
a
basis
of
race
and
against
women
and
young
people.
he
also
found
that
respondents
had
conducted
closed
and
secret
slate
meetings
in
violation
of
national
party
rules
and
he
also
found
that
respondents
had
no
rules
for
governing
their
procedures,
although,
that
too
was
required
by
democratic
national
party
rules.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
the
respondents
are
the
59
delegates
selected
in
accordance
with
the
illinois
election
code.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
they
were
the
delegates
that
were
elected
according
to
the
illinois
law.
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
in
late
june
1972,
petitioners
held
caucuses
throughout
the
city
of
chicago
in
which
they
selected
an
alternative
delegation.
the
delegates
--
the
candidates
for
delegate
who
had
been
on
the
ballot
on
march
17th
but
which
had
not
violated
the
national
democratic
party
rules
selected
an
alternative
delegation,
59
--
essentially,
the
59
petitioners
in
this
case.
on
june
30,
1972,
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
no,
they
do
not.
all
the
59
respondents
were
found
to
have
violated
the
national
party
rules,
your
honor.
on
june
30,
1972,
after
a
highly
publicized
and
intense
debate
before
the
credentials
committee
of
the
democratic
national
party,
the
credentials
committee
ruled
to
seek
petitioners
and
not
to
grant
respondents'
credentials
to
the
1972
convention.
the
credentials
committee
expressly
rejected
respondents'
claim
that
state
law
exclusively
governs
the
selection
of
delegates
to
the
1972
convention.
in
minority
report
of
the
credential's
committee
favoring
respondents'
position
was
filed
with
the
1972
democratic
national
convention.
on
monday,
july
3,
1972,
respondents
filed
and
action
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
they
sought
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
credentials
committee.
they
alleged
that
they
have
been
exclusive
--
they
have
been
elected
in
accordance
with
state
law
and
therefore
were
entitled
to
be
seated.
they
also
alleged
violation
of
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
on
the
same
day,
july
3rd,
the
federal
district
court
judge
hart
dismissed
respondents'
complaint.
now,
the
credentials
committee
had
also
voted
to
unseat
the
part
of
the
delegates
which
had
been
elected
in
accordance
with
the
california
primary
law
and
to
seat
in
it
instead
that
delegation
selected
by
appointment
of
the
presidential
contenders
other
than
mr.
mcgovern.
that
delegation,
the
unseated
california
delegates
also
brought
an
action
in
federal
district
court
and
their
complaint
was
also
dismissed
by
judge
hart.
on
the
4th
of
july,
the
day
after
the
dismissal
by
judge
hart,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
combined
both
the
california
and
the
illinois
cases
for
oral
argument.
oral
argument
was
heard
on
the
4th
of
july.and
on
july
5th,
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
ruling.
the
court
said
and
expressly
approved
the
resolution
of
the
credentials
committee
seating
petitioners
and
unseating
our
respondents.
to
protect
this
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
appeals
also
granted
an
injunction
to
prohibit
the
illinois
respondents
from
proceeding
in
any
other
court.
on
the
same
day
the
respondents'
petitioned
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
for
a
stay
of
the
elec
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
decision.
on
the
evening
of
july
7,
1972,
this
court's
opinion
issued
granting
a
stay
of
both
the
illinois
and
the
california
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
also
expressly
denying
--
expressly
refusing
to
act
on
respondents'
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
following
evening,
july
8th,
respondents
petitioned
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
for
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
petitioners
from
participating
as
the
delegates
from
the
chicago
districts
in
the
1972
convention.
petitioners
did
participate
in
that
convention
and
after
a
hard
fought
political
battle,
after
which
numerous
comprises
were
offered
and
rejected
by
various
parties,
the
1972
convention
upheld
the
ruling
of
a
hearing
examiner
and
the
holding
of
its
credentials
committee
that
respondents
had
violated
national
party
rules
and
that
national
credential
should
be
awarded
to
petitioners
and
not
to
respondents.
on
august
2,
1972,
briefly
after
the
convention
was
over,
respondents
again
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
and
sought
an
injunction
against
petitioners
from
participating
from
in
the
selection
of
national
committee
men
and
committee
women
from
illinois.
on
october
10,
1972,
this
court
remanded
the
case
of
keane
v.
national
democratic
party
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
and
on
february
16,
1973,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
found
that
the
national
convention
had
acted
within
its
confidence
in
granting
its
credentials
to
petitioners
and
refusing
the
credentials
to
respondents.
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
case
moot
but
nonetheless
affirmed
the
decision
of
judge
hart
dismissing
respondents'
complaint.
on
september
12,
1973,
the
illinois'
appellate
court
affirmed
the
two
injunction
orders
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
the
illinois
appellate
court
found
that
illinois
law
was
exclusive
and
convention
rules
and
national
rules
were
of
no
effect
and
that
the
illinois
law
exclusively
govern
the
election
of
delegates
to
the
convention
and
the
convention
was
without
power
or
authority
to
refuse
the
seat
them.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
declined
to
review
the
illinois
appellate
court
decision.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that
was
the
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
all
of
their
functions
had
expired
with
the
exception
of
the
power
to
select
the
national
committee
men
and
committee
women.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
no,
they're
not.
they
still
continue
to
hold
office
as
delegates
to
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
until
the
next
convention.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
there
will
be
another
primary
your
honor.
but
our
position
is
that
a
person
is
not
a
delegate
until
he's
been
granted
the
credentials
by
the
appropriate
authority
of
the
national
party.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
the
illinois
appellate
court
simply
sustained
the
injunction
of
the
cook
county
court
which
prohibited
petitioners
from
acting
in
anyway
its
delegates,
for
holding
themselves
out
as
delegates.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
the
next
primary
election
will
be
in
march
of
1976.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
if
i
didn't
say
that
i
certainly
meant
to
imply
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
by
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
on
the
other
hand,
the
petitioners
are
the
certified
delegates
to
the
convention
and
have
the
credentials
which
have
been
granted
by
the
national
party.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
there
are
two
injunctions
involved,
your
honor.
one
injunction
is
the
august
2nd
order
which
currently
restrains
petitioners
from
acting
as
delegates
in
selecting
national
committee
men
and
committee
women,
that's
the
august
2nd
order.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
is
preventing
the
clients
from
holding
a
meeting,
selecting
a
national
committee
man
and
committee
women
--
woman
from
chicago
--from
illinois
and
presenting
them
to
the
democratic
national
committee.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that
comes
up
under
national
party
rules
as
a
duty
and
responsibility
of
the
certified
delegates
from
each
state.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it's
a
four-year
term.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
respondents
participated
in
an
election
because
petitioners
were
enjoined
on
august
5,
1972.
so,
the
term
of
national
committee
man
and
committee
woman
from
illinois
will
run
from
the
national
convention
in
1972
until
the
end
of
the
national
convention
in
1976.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
is
--
it
is
filled
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
accepted
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
accepted
them
subject
to
challenge.
we
--
the
petitioners
were
unable
to
challenge
because
there
enjoined
by
the
cook
county
court.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
the
petitioners
will
hold
a
meeting
which
they
were
enjoined
from
holding
by
the
august
2nd
order.
they
will
select
nominees
for
national
committee
men
and
committee
women
and
present
them
to
the
democratic
national
committee.
i
might
say
that
the
july
8th
order
of
1972
is
in
our
judgment
that
still
has
some
force
and
that
the
trial
judge
in
cook
county
has
deferred
any
action
on
the
contempt
proceedings
until
such
a
time
as
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
rule.
petitioners
respectfully
submit
that
all
the
proceedings
in
the
cook
county
court
after
the
july
5,
1972
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
were
barred
by
clear
and
unambiguous
principles
of
res
judicata.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
expressly
held:
first,
that
all
the
parties
in
the
federal
form
were
the
same
as
all
the
parties
in
the
state
form;
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
expressly
approved
the
resolution
of
the
credentials
committee
seating
petitioners
and
unseating
respondents
and
granting
petitioners
national
convention
delegates.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
yes.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
on
july
5,
1972.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
and
that
was
after
the
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
was
august
5,
1972?
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
after
the
national
convention.
and
that
was
--
the
national
party
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
they
are
seated
subject
to
challenge.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
the
democratic
national
committee.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
yes,
they
have.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
yes.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
the
committee
can't
rule
on
the
challenge
because
the
petitioners
are
currently
enjoined
from
bringing
it.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
i
might
say,
your
honor
that
it's
a
continuing
reoccurring
question
which
is
inevitably
will
arise
at
the
last
minute
just
as
this
case.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
i
said
before
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
expressly
held
that
all
the
parties
were
the
same.
it
also
expressly
approved
the
resolution
granting
respon
--
granting
petitioners'
credentials
and
denying
respondents'
credentials.
it
further
held
that
respondents
state
court
claim
was
to
be
rejected
and
if
it
were
to
be
considered
that
there
would
be
an
impairment
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
association.
this
court
expressly
refused
to
grant
respondents'
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
under
unambiguous
law,
a
stayed
but
unreversed
judgment
is
res
judicata
in
an
absolute
bar
to
subsequent
proceedings.
for
this
reason,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
judgments
below
should
be
dismissed.
for
over
a
100
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
vacate
its
judgment,
justice
rehnquist.
on
october
10,
1972,
this
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
case
was
moot.
so,
at
the
time
that
both
orders
were
entered
by
the
cook
county
court,
july
8th
and
august
2nd,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
outstanding
but
stayed.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
the
two
reported
cases
where
the
mcqueen
case
and
the
houser
case
which
are
in
our
brief
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
you
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
aware
of
a
lower
court
decision
in
the
state
of
georgia
which
purported
to
pass
on
the
credentials
of
the
--
which
was
lawfully
elected
delegation
from
georgia.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that
was
in
the
intermediate
and
lower
courts.
that
same
year,
there
was
a
decision
by
the
trial
court
in
mississippi,
on
a
mississippi
challenge
to
the
republican
nation
--
in
the
republican
national
committee.
in
1972,
in
the
riddell
case,
there's
a
decision
in
which
the
federal
district
court
in
mississippi
held
that
the
loyal
democrats
not
selected
in
accordance
with
state
law
could
be
seated
at
the
national
convention
and
the
regular
democrats
elected
in
accordance
with
state
law
were
properly
excluded.
the
interests
of
a
state
are
in
large
part
at
odds
or
could
be
at
odds
with
the
interest
of
the
national
democratic
party.
this
is
certainly
been
true
in
the
area
of
party
loyalty.
it's
been
true
in
the
area
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
your
honor,
the
complaint
by
its
terms
does
not
raise
a
federal
question
and
indeed
that
was
established
by
judge
will
in
the
seventh
circuit
on
respondent's
motion
to
remand.
the
federal
question
from
the
point
of
view
of
petitioners
is
at
least
three-fold.
first
of
all,
our
basic
rights
of
association
had
been
violated
by
the
injunction
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
by
the
state
of
illinois.
secondly,
we
think
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
guarantees
us
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
right
to
participate
in
a
national
process.
so,
we
believe
that
our
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
been
breached
by
the
injunction.
and
thirdly,
we
think
that
this
process
is
inherently
national
in
nature
and
if
any
state
could
abridge
the
rights
to
participate
in
a
national
convention.
the
national
party
would
lose
its
effectiveness.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that's
right.
what
we
had
in
mind
there
were
the
interest
which
this
court
has
expressed
in
cases
such
as
shapiro
against
thompson,
nelson
against
pennsylvania
where
the
city
of
burbank
where
there's
a
national
interest
at
stake.
and
therefore,
a
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
is
a
private
associational
interest
but
to
the
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
but
if
there's
to
be
any
regulation,
it
certainly
has
to
be
federal,
it
couldn't
be
stayed.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
we
certainly
do
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
it
--
what's
at
stake
here
because
the
injunction
order
did
not
prohibit
us
from
traveling
by
its
terms.
it
simply
prohibited
the
petitioners
from
presenting
themselves
as
delegates.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
yes.
if
the
law
were
any
different
on
the
11th
hour
of
every
convention,
state
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
would
be
issuing
injunction
orders
in
accordance
with
state
law
which
would
affect
the
outcome
of
the
national
conventions
as
judge
will
pointed
in
his
decision,
this
is
obviously
intolerable
result.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
yes.
and
as
a
matter
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
i,
i--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
we
need
to
reach
that
decision
here.
the
national
conventions
as
a
practical
matter
and
indeed
in
most
cases
differ
to
the
state's
process
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
might
not
be
if
a
constitutional
questions
were
presented
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case
or
if
there
were
federal
regulation
which
is
not
involved
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that
is
correct,
other
than
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
electors
are
not
involved
and
other
than,
to
the
extent
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
and
as
you
know
your
honor
that
has
repeatedly
happened.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
in
--
to
support
the
injunction
in
this
case,
the
respondents
had
argued
that
there's
a
compelling
state
interest.
while
they
don't
argue
that
there
are
any
constitutional
rights
at
stake,
they
say
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
its
election
process
and
to
achieve
this
protection,
they
would
have
that
injunction
be
issued.
but
the
effect
of
that
injunction
is
one
of
two
things.
first,
it
would
force
the
national
party
to
seat
respondents.
that's
what
the
illinois
appellate
court
said.
individuals
who
the
national
party
has
expressly
found
violated
their
most
fundamental
principles
and
with
whom
the
national
party
did
not
want
to
associate.
or
the
second
thing
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
persons
from
illinois
as
seated
at
the
national
convention.
it's
not
conceivable
what
state
interest
is
protected
by
having
no
citizens
from
the
state
of
illinois
and
that
was
certainly
the
interest
which
persuaded
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
riddell
court.
also,
that
argument
ignores
the
strong
national
interest
of
the
party
to
associate
so
it
can
rally
its
members
for
its
nominee
to
win
the
november
election.
the
argument
ignores
that.
for
these
reasons,
we
would
respectfully
request
that
the
judgments
below
be
reversed.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
there's
that
--
there's
also
the
problem
that
if
persons
wanting
to
participate
in
a
national
convention
can
have
injunctions
issued
against
them
and
if
the
judgments
are
subsequently
reversed
but
those
individuals
have
to
stand
for
contempt,
that's
certainly
will
chill
in
the
future
any
first
amendment
rights
or
incentive
to
bring
this
kind
of
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
it
will
decide
that.
the
tri
--
the
cook
county
judge
has
also
deferred
any
further
action
pending
review
of
this
case.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
wanted
to
address
the
question
of
whether
the
exclusivity
of
illinois
law
was
raised
in
keane
against
national
democratic
party.
it
was
raised
indeed
at
all
three
levels.
in
their
complaint
before
judge
hart,
respondents
asked
that
the
court
declare
a
judge
in
decree
that
the
plaintiff
and
delegates,
respondents
--
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
its
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
had
been
duly
elected
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
illinois
election
mode
--
code
and
that
therefore
they'll
be
entitled
to
take
their
seats
as
delegates.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
yes,
he
did
but
then
it
came
up
again
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
no.
your
honor,
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
challenge
delegates
claim
if
the
national
party
could
not
abridge
their
rights
under
illinois
law
to
have
the
delegate
seats
for
which
they've
been
elected.
the
relationship
in
this
case
between
the
illinois
law
and
the
party
regulations
offers
no
ground
for
relief.
and
on
page
5
of
our
reply
brief,
we
quote
the
court
of
appeals
which
states,
“the
resolution
of
the
committee
which
we
have
here
approved,
provides
that
the
59
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
are
not
to
be
seated
as
the
delegates
to
the
national
convention
from
which
--
from
their
districts
in
illinois.”
it
also
provides
that
59
other
person
shall
be
seated
as
the
delegates
from
those
districts.
and
in
their
motion
for
this
--
a
stay
in
this
court
following
july
5th,
the
same
arguments
were
raised
and
the
illinois
election
law
pleaded.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
yes,
it
is.
mr.
wayne
w.
whalen
there's
no
argument
on
that
point.
thank
you.
