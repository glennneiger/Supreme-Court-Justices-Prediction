mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state's
interest
is
insufficient
to
enable
it
to
enforce
voting
and
associational
rights
of
its
citizens
through
injunction
proceedings
against
certain
of
its
citizens
from
assuming
party
officers
to
which
they
were
not
elected,
and
from
representing
a
particular
electorate
which
did
not
choose
them.
the
facts
underlying
this
issue
have
been
largely,
totally
ignored
by
petitioners
and
have
not
been
properly
heard
in
any
court
until
they
were
heard
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
those
underlying
facts
which
give
rise
to
the
injunction
and
which
were
not
heard
are
the
illinois
election
law.
the
nature
of
the
election
itself,
the
voter
and
associational
rights
of
illinois
citizens
to
choose
their
representatives,
and
to
associate
with
each
other
in
political
parties,
and
the
findings
that
were
made
concerning
the
nature
of
the
petitioner's
slate
of
delegates
itself
and
the
manner
in
which
they
were
chosen
by
the
state.
with
regard
to
all
these
things,
we
are
here
on
a
record
which
is
largely
uncontested
and
in
which
the
findings
of
fact
which
came
after
two
evidentiary
hearings
which
all
persons
who
participated
were
not
objected
to.
i
would
like
to
dispose,
if
i
may,
of
the
res
judicata
argument
because
that
has
taken
up
a
large
part
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
in
the
context
of
these
cases,
it
creates
a
cloud
which
has
to
be
dispelled.
if
anything,
res
judicata
requires
an
identity
of
issues
in
opportunity
to
litigate
those
issues.
the
issues
before
the
district
of
columbia
courts,
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court,
were
the
constitutionality
of
certain
guidelines
of
the
democratic
party.
these
included
two
guidelines
concerning
the
imposition
of
quotas
and
two
guidelines
which
dealt
with
slate-making
in
the
endorsement
of
candidates.
when
this
came
before
the
district
court,
judge
hart
specifically
refused
to
hear
any
questions
concerning
the
legality
of
the
slate's
chosen
in
illinois
but
concern
himself
only
with
the
questions
of
constitutionality
of
the
guidelines
holding
three
constitutional
and
one
unconstitutional
and
he
refused
to
issue
an
injunction
sought
by
the
democratic
national
committee
against
state
court
proceedings.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
original
litigants
in
that
case
were
the
duly
elected
delegates
in
illinois
through
a
representative
--
the
demo
--
and
the
democratic
national
committee.
when
the
case
went
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
unreviewed,
the
court
sustained
judge
hart's
finding
with
regard
to
the
one
particular
guideline
which
he
held
unconstitutional.
the
court
stated
specifically
in
part
two
of
its
opinion
which
dealt
with
the
illinois
challenge
to
the
guidelines
that
the
issue
before
the
court
below
was
the
constitutionality
of
the
guidelines.
the
court
then
went
on
in
part
three
which
dealt
with
the
illinois
counterclaim
and
said,
“because
the
convention
is
heard
upon
us,
the
issue
must
be
decided,
not
heard
but
decided.”
and
thereupon
issue
its
injunction
against
the
proceedings
in
the
illinois
court.
the
court
made
clear
in
its
opinion
that
judge
hart
stated
that
the
legality
of
the
slate
--
of
petitioners
here
was
not
for
him
but
nevertheless
issued
its
injunction
which
was
subsequently
stayed
by
this
court.
so
that
when
the
case
went
that
to
illinois
with
all
parties
present
by
counsel
for
evidentiary
hearing,
there
had
been
no
finding
concerning
the
legality
of
petitioner's
slate,
and
this
was
the
only
and
precise
question
presented
to
the
illinois
court.
so,
in
these
circumstances
where
there
were
no
identity
of
issues,
no
opportunity
to
litigate,
no
pleadings
or
proof,
and
no
finding
concerning
legality
of
that
slate.
it
seems
difficult
to
us
to
concede
or
assume
that
there
was
some
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
effect
leftover
after
the
injunction
had
been
stayed
by
this
court
at
the
time
this
court
criticized
the
district
of
columbia
--
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
that's
correct
your
honor.
they're
not
at
issue
in
the
slate
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
in
this
case
and
in
fact
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
before
district
judge
hart.
and
i
should
say
there
were
two
hearings.
the
first
hearing
was
held
about
10
days
prior
to
that
which
gave
rise
to
the
case
which
reach
your
court.
judge
hart's
ruling
was
held
to
be
premature
at
that
time.
judge
hart
specifically
instructed
the
litigants
that
he
would
not
hear
any
questions
concerning
the
illinois
election
law
or
the
legality
of
these
slates
but
would
concern
himself
solely
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
guidelines.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
no
one
raised
it.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
no
sir,
your
honor.
it
was
not
open.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
judge
hart
specifically
precluded
that
question.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
well,
when
we
came
in
your
honor.
we
alleged
the
bona
fides
of
the
respondent
group.
in
other
words,
the
duly
elected
delegate
and
we
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
no.
no,
sir
and
we
were
even
precluded
from
putting
in
evidence
concerning
the
nature
of
the
election
in
the
manner
which
we
were
chosen.
so,
we
were
held
in
the
district
court
to
very
narrow
issues
and
these
were
the
issues
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
were
suddenly
expanded
upon
in
part
three
of
the
opinion
of
that
court
which
issued
the
injunction.
i
should
state
the
injunction,
the
complaint
for
injunction
was,
again,
not
based
upon
the
bona
fides
of
either
of
the
slates
but
only
upon
the
rights
of
association
of
the
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
national
party.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
not
only
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
there's
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
correct.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
it
was
not
an
issue
nor
with
defense
which
might
give
rise
to
a
decision
before
the
court.
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
illinois
court
found
that
the
illinois
elections
was
free,
equal,
open,
and
non-discriminatory.
that
challenge
was
never
--
that
finding
was
never
challenged.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
particular
election
with
which
we're
concerned,
it
should
be
noted
that
prior
to
the
fight
over
the
guidelines,
there
was
certainly
a
great
deal
of
federal
intervention
into
the
illinois
procedures.
for
example,
the
delegates
were
chosen
from
single
member
from
districts,
congressional
districts.
these
districts
had
been
recently
reapportioned
by
a
plan
approved
by
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
which
enjoins
state
agencies
from
acting
in
any
way
to
put
forth
their
own
plan.
so,
the
districts
from
which
the
delegates
where
chosen,
the
congressional
districts,
were
established
by
the
federal
court,
one
man
one
vote
and
no
invidious
discrimination.
secondly,
the
persons
who
could
choose
the
representatives
for
democratic
party
were
also
determine
by
the
federal
courts
in
kusper
versus
pontikes
which
voided
the
illinois
anti-rating
statute
which
provided
then
that
anyone
could
vote
in
a
democratic
primary.
this
court
kusper
versus
pontikes
subsequently
affirm
that
finding
and
said,
that
the
citizens
of
illinois
had
to
have
the
right
to
associate
with
other
members
of
the
party
to
choose
their
representatives.
thirdly,
the
federal
courts
three
years
earlier,
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
weisberg
versus
powell
determined
the
method
in
which
persons
were
to
be
place
on
the
ballot
in
situations
such
as
this.
it
was
to
be
by
luck
or
half
draw
if
you
will
base
upon
the
day
that
your
application
was
received
by
the
secretary
of
state.
so,
here
we
have
a
situation
in
which
many
aspects
of
this
particular
election
including
the
district,
the
electorate
from
which
the
choice
was
to
be
made
and
ballot
position
was
determined
by
the
federal
court,
and
it
now
appears
to
be
petitioners
position
here
that
having
done
all
these,
the
vote
should
not
be
counted.
especially,
after
they
concede
that
the
election
was
free,
open
and
non-discriminatory.
we
think,
your
honor,
that
there
can
be
no
such
result
as
they
are
but
that
the
votes
were
entitled
to
be
counted
and
that
the
election
was
not
a
charade.
the
illinois
rules
were
very
clear,
anyone
could
run.
there
were
minimal
requirements.
anyone
could
vote
and
in
fact
they
did
vote.
there
were
challenged
procedures
at
all
phases
of
the
election
process
and
yet
not
one
of
the
180
candidates
for
the
62
delegate
positions
were
challenged
by
anyone
throughout
the
election
process.
in
it's
this
particular
election,
this
popular
election,
held
under
these
safeguards
that
petitioners
here
say
must
be
totally
ignored.
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
result
that
can
be
reached.
and
what
was
the
state
interest
here
that
they
were
protecting?
we
have
to
look
to
that,
your
honor,
again
to
the
hearings
that
were
held
in
the
state
court
because
it's
the
only
place
that
such
hearings
were
held
and
this
concerns
the
manner
in
which
the
respond
--
the
petitioners,
i'm
sorry.
the
petitioners
were
chosen
to
represent
the
illinois
democratic
election.
they
were
chosen
in
private
caucuses.
the
rules
provided
that
only
the
losers
in
the
general
election
could
vote.
secondly,
strict
quotas
and
race,
sex,
and
age
were
applied.
third,
as
stated
in
the
appendix
by
one
of
the
district
coordinators,
one
of
the
counsels
for
petitioners,
the
rights
of
the
individual
voters
were
to
be
ignored.
and
lastly
again
is
in
the
record,
developed
on
cross
examination
from
the
co-leader
of
petitioners'
slate.
the
voters
who
voted
for
those
persons
who
won
were
disenfranchised
because
their
candidates
were
tainted
as
were
candidates
themselves.
so,
all
of
these
people
were
excluded
from
the
election
process
and
yet,
sought
to
represent
the
democratic
electorate
of
illinois
and
in
it's
against
this
group
that
the
state
issued
its
injunction.
now,
when
i
talked
about
quotas,
the
evidence
is
very
clear
on
that.
for
example,
the
first
congressional
district
of
illinois
which
encompasses
the
hyde
park
area
is
in
large
measure
black,
part
white
and
at
the
caucus
meeting
held
in
private
home,
it
was
stated,
all
of
the
delegate
selected
could
--
must
be
black
based
upon
the
population
or
there
could
be
at
the
very
most
one
white.
now,
anyone
who
lives
in
hyde
park
in
chicago
shops
at
the
hyde
park
co-op,
it's
a
large
supermarket.
and
if
you
walked
down
the
aisle
there
pass
the
produce
sections,
it's
quite
obvious
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
orientals
who
live
in
hyde
park,
persons
of
oriental
descent
and
one
of
them
asked
at
the
caucus,
“may
i
be
elected?”
the
answer
was,
“no,
you
can't
be
elected.
you're
neither
black
nor
white.”
in
the
eight
district
where
only
four
persons
came
to
attend,
it
took
two
votes
to
determine
who
the
delegates
would
be
because
the
quotas
weren't
met.
so,
these
were
people
and
this
was
the
selection
process
that
was
to
be
foisted
upon
the
people
of
illinois
in
connection
with
the
convention.
now,
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
it
was
upon
the
nine,
i
believe
its
nine
congressional
districts
involved,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
i
think
your
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
no,
sir
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
they
cannot
refuse
to
sit
them.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
i
believe
that
was
powell
versus
mccormack.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
my
recollection,
your
honor
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
he
may
have
been
refused
his
seat,
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
people
were
chosen
in
his
place
by
congress.
but
the
submission
went
back
to
the
process
established
by
the
states
for
the
election.
so,
that
i
don't
think
congress
reached
out
to
choose
a
delegate.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
correct.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
correct
your
honor
and
i
don't
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
correct!
and
we're
not
arguing
that
issue
before
this
court.
i
think
the
issue
here
your
honor,
is
whether
the
illinois
state
court
had
the
power
to
enjoin
certain
person
from
acting
as
delegates
from
specific
illinois
congressional
districts.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
well,
it
maybe
a
long
arm
statute,
your
honor,
but
to
say
anything
else
of
course,
would
be
to
negate
the
idea
of
popular
elections
of
delegates
nor
do
i
think,
your
honor
that
is
consistent
with
any
great
interest
of
the
convention.
and
i
think
your
honor
that
that
brings
us
to
this
problem
of
the
associational
rights
that
have
been
raised
here.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
correct.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
no,
sir.
that
is
not
before
the
court.
we
think
whether
illinois
has
an
interest
in
its
own
election
laws
which
govern
the
selection
of
party
officials
to
prevent
its
citizens
from
usurping
those
laws
and
acting
for
representatives
of
illinois
citizens
who
did
not
elect
them.
with
regard
to
that,
if
i
might
your
honor,
the
right
of
association
here
is
not
the
right
of
a
few
individuals
to
associate
at
the
convention
with
the
democratic
national
convention.
i
think
the
associational
rights
here,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
pontikes
versus
kusper,
are
the
rights
of
the
voters
to
associate
with
other
members
of
the
party
in
selecting
their
representatives.
and
secondly,
to
associate
with
other
members
in
an
election
process
that
here
is
concededly
free,
equal,
open
and
non-discriminatory
to
select
those
representatives.
and
third,
if
we
must,
the
right
of
the
state
parties
themselves
to
associate
through
their
duly
elected
representatives
with
the
representatives
of
other
state
parties
in
the
convention,
so
that
they
can
choose
the
nominees
for
one
of
our
major
parties.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
i
think
they
could
say
that
your
honor.
but
i
think
it
would
have
a
serious
--
that
would
cause
serious
change
in
the
nature
of
the
convention
process
itself
and
i
think
what
it
would
do
your
honor,
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
they
could
say
that.
they
could
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
well,
they
could
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
sure.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
i
suppose
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
we
concede
the
right
of
the
convention.
i
suppose
the
state
would
not
have
to
recognized
the
nominee
of
the
convention
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
right.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
right.
but
i
also
think
your
honor,
that
if
that
question
were
to
arise,
and
it
isn't
before
the
court,
we
would
some
other
questions
to
consider.
first
the
nature
of
state
action,
whether
the
convention
itself
is
state
action
and
whether
its
exclusion
in
its
method
of
selection
of
delegates
who
will
choose
the
nominee
of
one
of
our
great
party
for
president
is
a
proper
method.
in
other
words,
the
convention
isn't
a
voluntary
association.
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
here
of
state
action
but
it
certainly
is
a
great
quasi-public
body
performing
a
very,
very
important
function.
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
only
way
in
which
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
that's
conceivable
your
honor.
well,
i
think
conceivable
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
right.
that's
correct.
illinois
might
not
have
had
delegates
and
we
would
submit
your
honor
that
that
result
would
be
preferable
to
the
result
which
did
occur,
in
which
the
party
sought
to
construct
itself
from
the
top-up
rather
than
the
bottom-down
by
picking
out
the
people
who
would
represent
the
illinois
electorate.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
correct.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
correct.
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
if
the
state
selection
system
has
not
been
referred
to
a
state
party
as
it
has
been
in
some
states
and
if
the
state
selection
system
is
it
was
in
illinois,
a
popular
election
which
is
free
and
open
to
all.
and
i
think
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
not
enjoin
them
from
going
there,
not
enjoin
them
from
participating,
not
enjoining
them
from
serving
on
convention
committees
by
enjoining
them
from
representing
the
electorate
as
delegates,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
well
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
in
the
mississippi
challenges
earlier
your
honor,
what
the
convention
did
was
create
positions
of
delegate
at
large
for
certain
of
the
members
of
the
mississippi
delegation
and
i
suppose
here,
if
the
convention
really
wanted
this
particular
group,
they
could
have
created
offices
for
them.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
the
state
of
illinois,
we
would
submit
your
honor,
has
a
right
to
protect
its
own
election
laws
and
its
own
electorate
which
participated
in
an
election
held
under
the
offices
of
the
state
of
illinois.
and
it
could
protect
that
by
issuing
injunctions
which
would
prevent
illinois
citizens
within
the
jurisdiction
of
its
court
from
subverting
those
laws.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
yes,
sir.
oh,
sure.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
that's
correct.
they
would
have
the
problem
of
facing
up
to
the
consequences
in
illinois
and
in
this
particular
instance
your
honors,
so
that
the
contempt
--
the
status
of
the
contempt
proceeding
is
known,
petitions
for
rule
of
the
show
cause
have
been
issued.
the
trial
judge
has
held
the
case
pending
the
resolution
on
appeal
of
the
various
issues
raised,
so
that
that
case,
although
not
formally
stayed
by
order
is
in
fact
stayed
really
awaiting
the
decision
of
the
ultimate
reviewing
court,
in
this
instance,
this
particular
court.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
i
haven't
considered
that
question
your
honor.
but
i
would
assume
first
--
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
the
--
i
would
think
your
honor
that
not
only
with
habeas
corpus
be
available
but
of
course
there
would
be
an
appeal
route
from
the
contempt
conviction
itself,
if
there
were
such
a
conviction
and
a
penalty
imposed.
the
normal
appeal
procedures
would
be
in
effect
through
the
illinois
courts
and
i
suppose
ultimately
on
certiorari
by
this
court,
if
the
court
shows
to
take
or
if
it
went
that
far.
so,
certainly
the
trial
judge
will
not
be
the
ultimate
--
will
make
--
will
not
make
the
ultimate
disposition
in
this
case.
but
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
was
concerned
because
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
illinois
appellate
court
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
to
act
it
all
and
it's
come
up
to
this
case.
your
honor,
we
think
that
in
this
particular
matter,
the
delegates
were
elected
by
the
people
of
the
state
in
a
proper
and
fair
election.
there
is
no
fraud
alleged
in
this
election.
there
were
no
challenges.
they
had
bonafide
credentials
to
represent
the
democratic
electorates.
we
do
not
think
that
the
petitioners
had
such
credentials
and
we
think
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
illinois
court
was
entitled
to
protect
not
only
those
people
who
voted
in
the
illinois
primary
but
those
who
took
office
and
also
to
protect
the
illinois
election
structure
itself.
now,
i
should
conclude
your
honors
by
stating
in
the
appendix
at
page
106,
there's
a
transcript
of
what
happened
at
one
of
the
caucuses
held
by
the
petitioners
wherein
their
delegates
where
their
slate
were
elected
and
in
answer
to
complaints
raised
by
the
assembled
citizenry,
they
said,
“raise
this
question
in
the
state
courts.”
and
this
is
precisely
what
was
done
your
honor,
and
we
think
it
would
be
reversing
the
trend
of
history
to
say
that
the
state
courts
did
not
held
a
sufficient
interest
to
enable
it
to
protect
its
own
election
laws
in
its
electorate.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
right.
mr.
jerome
h.
torshen
that's
correct.
