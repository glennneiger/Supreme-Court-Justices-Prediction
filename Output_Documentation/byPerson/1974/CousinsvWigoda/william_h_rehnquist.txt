justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
whalen,
we've
certainly
taken
jurisdiction
of
some
cases
where
there's
been
an
appeal
from
an
injunction
without
any
contempt
citation
where
the
party
has
yet
to
disobey
the
injunction.
and
we've
taken
jurisdiction
of
cases
where
a
party
has
disobeyed
an
injunction
and
had
a
contempt
citation
or
contempt
penalty
imposed
on
it.
but
i
know
the
trouble
about
the
posture
of
your
case.
you
have
had
an
injunction
issued
against
your
client.
your
clients
have
disobeyed
the
injunction,
so
the
injunction
didn't
frustrate
anything
they
wanted
to
do
and
there's
a
possibility
of
contempt
proceedings
against
them.
but
as
i
understand
it,
no
actual
contempt
penalties
have
been
imposed
on
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
practical
effect
does
that
injunction
have
in
your
clients
at
this
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
--
does
that
come
every
two
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
national
committee
man
or
committee
woman
and
doesn't
have
any
particular
term?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
was
the
--
when
were
they
elected
last
in
illinois?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
by
that
time
there'll
be
new
delegates
by
anybody's
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
a
subsequent
vacation
of
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
its
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
concede
that
after
the
vacation
of
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
this
court
that
that
judgment
was
no
longer
in
effect?
that
judgment
was
no
longer
in
effect
at
that
time.
but
then
on
february
16th,
the
court
of
appeals
acted
again
on
remand
from
this
court
and
at
that
time,
the
court
said
that
the
convention
had
acted
within
its
competence
in
seating
petitioners
and
refusing
credentials
to
respondents,
and
further
it
affirmed
judge
hart.
under
the
munsingwear
decision,
the
affirmance
is
important
because
it
is
a
--
that
that
decision
holds
that
eventhough
the
case
was
found
to
be
moot
that
keane
v.
national
democratic
party
continued
to
have
a
res
judicata
bar.
for
over
150
years,
the
national
parties
have
met
in
quadrennial
conventions
to
select
their
nominees
and
citizens
from
the
states
have
brought
credentials
challenges
to
assert
principles
ranging
from
party
loyalty,
racial
discrimination,
basic
principles,
silver
or
gold,
are
often
times
just
to
established
a
true
national
republican
party
or
a
true
national
democratic
party.
and
credential's
challenges
are
the
proven
and
historic
means
for
citizens
in
exercise
of
this
first
amendment
activity
to
uphold
party
principles
and
to
assert
of
the
rights
of
the
national
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
feel
you
have
a
fundamental
right
to
travel
to
the
national
convention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
put
to
mr.
whalen,
mr.
torshen?
what
if
the
democratic
national
party
decides,
we
don't
want
popular
elected
delegates
to
our
convention.
we
want
one
just
chosen
by
state
conventions,
is
it
free
to
go
ahead
on
that
basis
even
though
illinois
law
says
that
delegates
to
national
convention
shall
be
chosen
in
an
election?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
its
remedy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
get
a
spot
on
that
--
