well,
as
a
matter
fact
i
gather
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
states
have
absolutely
no
role
to
play.

a
national
--
if
the
convention
sets
up
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
procedures
and
methods
by
which
these
delegates
will
be
elected?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
alright.

say
that's

business
of
the
national
convention
to
differ
or
not?
