the
only
impact
of
decision
here,
am
i
correct,
as
to
the
immediate
situation
would
be
the
identity
of
the
members
of
the
national
committee
from
state.
is
that
not
the
only
remaining
question?
i'm
not
talking
about
what's
going
to
happen
in
1976,
but
presently
the
only
impact
to
what
we
would
decide.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
excluding
the
consequences
just
the
present
ones.decision
of
this
court
now
would
decide
who
which
body
is
going
to
elect
the
national

members
from
the
state
of
illinois.
chief

warren
e.

have
there
not
been
a
number
of
occasions
in
history
when
congress
refused
to
seat
a
member
elected
by
a
particular
district
in
a
particular
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
does
not
in
more
such
cases.
for
example,
one
that
was
recently
referred
to
in
one
of
our
opinions,
the
man
elected
was
a
general
and
he
was
refused
to
seat
because
he
wouldn't
resign
his
commission
and
another
case,
he
was
the
united
states
attorney.
and
he
was
refused
to
seat
because
he
would
not
give
up
his
position
as
united
states
attorney.
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
these
men
could
go
down
to
the
convention?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
vote
and
do
everything
they
wanted
to
but
when
they
get
back
to
illinois,
they
might
have
a
little
problem
with
being
in
contempt
to
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
hypothetical
situation
that
we
were
just
talking
about
that
is
these
delegates
go
to
the
convention
in
violation
of
the
state
court
injunctions,
take
their
seats,
perform
all
their
functions,
come
back
or
cited
for
and
found
him
in
contempt,
would
the
traditional
remedies
of
federal
habeas
corpus
be
open
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
they
would
at
the
time,
wouldn't
they?
