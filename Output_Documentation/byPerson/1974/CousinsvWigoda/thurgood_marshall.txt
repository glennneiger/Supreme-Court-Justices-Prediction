justice
thurgood
marshall
outside
of
the
state
of
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
foisted
upon
the
people
of
illinois
or
upon
the
democratic
convention?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
question
is
as
to
whether
they
shall
be
seated
not
as
to
whether
they
shall
be
or
how
they
should
be
elected
in
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
may
i
finish.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
whether
they
shall
be
seated
at
the
democratic
convention.
now,
if
understand,
am
i
correct,
that
the
state
of
illinois
can
elect
a
representative
to
congress
and
congress
can
refuse
to
sit
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
they
can't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
powell
no,
that
was
no
seating.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i've
said
that
there
were
instance
where
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
had
exercise
its
rights
at
all,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
this
case
the
state
exercised
its
rights
and
i
thought
convention
was
asserting
its
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
that's
what
happened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
a
convention
refuse
to
sit
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
the
democratic
convention
recognizes
this
as
such.
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
long
arm
statute
really
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
if
you
have
a
convention
under
the
proposed
party
rules
in
the
state
you'd
have
the
injunction
and
stop
them
from
going
to
the
national
convention?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
they
have
a
state
convention
with
the
state
of
illinois
says
is
not
lawful
under
the
state
law
and
they
elect
delegates
to
the
national
convention
in
the
pudong,
outside
the
state
illinois.
the
state
of
illinois
could
enjoin
them
from
going
to
the
convention.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
under
what
rule
or
law
do
you
get
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
go
to
the
convention.
they
vote
in
a
convention.
but
if
they
say,
they
vote
as
a
delegate
of
illinois,
they
violate
the
injunction.
if
they
say
i
voted
joe
jones,
i
don't
violate
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
it
right
as
the
state
of
illinois
has
to
control
the
internal
affairs
of
a
national
party
convention
held
outside
of
the
state
of
illinois?
