justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
what
you're
suggesting
also
i
suppose
that
conventions
have
no
business
or
political
parties
do
have
the
business
of
saying
how
delegates
to
their
convention
could
be
elected
if
they're
going
to
be
given
credentials?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
say,
i
suppose
according
to
you
that
the
party
could
say
delegates
must
be
chosen
in
the
convention
process
rather
than
by
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
has
no
--
would
have
no
business
insisting
that
delegates
be
elected
rather
than
chosen
on
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand
the
convention
has
no
business
interfering
with
the
state's
constitutional
prerogatives
with
respect
to
the
selection
of
electors?
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
not
involved
here,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
needed
i
suppose
except
the
parties
--
the
results
of
the
parties
work
at
the
national
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
i
guess
that
they
can't
seat
anybody
else
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that,
is
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
you
concede
divided
the
convention
that
they
must
concede
the
state's
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
together
if
that
it
is
--
we
sustain
your
view
here
what
or
if
your
view
would
have
been
followed
in
1972,
illinois
would
not
have
had
delegates
at
the
convention.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
you
say
that
the
convention
had
no
business
seating
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
the
state
has
a
--
the
party
hasn't
got
the
right
to
say
who
is
going
to
represent
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
reject
your
delegates
but
they
can't
do
anything
else.
