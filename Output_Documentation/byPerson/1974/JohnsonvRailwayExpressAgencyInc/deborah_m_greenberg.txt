ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
state's
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
writ
was
directed
to
the
question
of
whether
the
timely
filing
of
a
charge
of
employment
discrimination
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
tolls
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
an
action
based
on
the
same
facts
brought
under
section
1981.
petitioner
willy
johnson
junior,
a
black
man
was
hired
by
rea
express
in
1964.
in
1967,
he
filed
with
the
eeoc
a
charge
of
racial
discrimination
against
rea
and
two
locals
of
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks.
he
charged
rea
with
discriminatory
job
assignments
and
the
locals
with
being
racially
segregated.
three
weeks
later,
rea
fired
petitioner.
petitioner
then
amended
his
eeoc
charge
to
include
discriminatory
discharge.
respondents
were
given
notice
of
the
charges
in
september
1967.
an
eeoc
charge
--
investigation
substantiated
petitioner's
charge.
and
in
march
1970,
the
eeoc
issued
a
determination
finding
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
respondents
had
violated
the
title
vii.
after
efforts
at
conciliation
failed
on
january
4th
1971,
petitioner
received
from
the
eeoc
his
notice
of
right
to
sue
on
january
15,
1971.
when
he
was
unable
to
obtain
private
counsel,
the
district
court-appointed
counsel
to
represent
him
and
permitted
him
to
file
his
right
to
sue
a
letter
as
a
complaint
on
a
pauperis
oath.
on
march
18,
1971,
the
court-appointed
attorney
filed
a
supplemental
complaint
alleging
violation
of
both
title
vii
and
section
1981.
respondents
filed
motions
to
dismiss
or
for
summary
judgment
with
supporting
affidavits
and
memoranda
of
law.
petitioner's
court-appointed
attorney
filed
no
papers
in
opposition.
the
court
dismissed
all
claims
under
section
1981
as
barred
by
the
tennessee
one
year
statute
of
limitations
on
actions
for
compensatory
or
punitive
damages
brought
under
federal
civil
right
statutes.
on
a
record
which
contained
undisputed
evidence
of
the
maintenance
of
segregated
locals
and
higher
membership
dues
for
blacks,
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
“unions
on
the
grounds
that
plaintiffs
had,
“no
grounds
for
relief
under
title
vii”
and
granted
partial
summary
judgment
to
rea
on
the
issue
of
the
lack
of
supervisory
training.
the
issues
that
remained
in
the
case
were
claims
under
title
vii
against
rea
for
discriminatory
job
assignment
referral
to
segregated
locals,
discriminatory
application
of
seniority
rules
--
discriminatory
discharge
and
discriminatory
disciplinary
action.
the
case
was
set
for
trial
and
rea
took
discovery
and
filed
a
pretrial
memorandum
as
required
by
the
local
rules
of
court.
petitioner's
court-appointed
attorney
did
nothing.
rea
then
offered
petitioner
a
settlement
of
$150.00.
and
when
petitioner
refused
this
offer,
his
court-appointed
counsel
filed
a
motion
to
withdraw.
the
court
clerk
advised
the
petitioner
by
letter,
that
the
motion
of
which
petitioner
had
received
no
notice
had
been
granted
and
that
if
petitioner
did
not
obtain
another
lawyer
within
30
days,
his
case
would
be
dismissed.
petitioner
went
to
the
local
legal
aid
society,
to
the
bar
association
referral
service
and
to
two
private
attorneys
to
whom
he
was
referred
by
the
eeoc,
all
to
no
avail.
finally,
he
went
to
a
memphis
law
firm
and
explained
his
plight
to
william
caldwell.
i
should
explain
at
this
point
that
when
petitioner
first
received
his
right
to
sue
a
letter,
he
went
to
the
same
firm
and
they
were
unable
to
take
his
case
because
of
the
great
number
of
title
vii
cases
to
which
the
court
had
appointed
them.
caldwell
wrote
to
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court
stating
that
he
was
attempting
to
obtain
support
for
the
suit
and
requesting
an
additional
30
days
to
obtain
counsel.
but
just
the
day
before,
on
february
16,
1972,
an
order
had
been
entered
dismissing
petitioner's
case
without
prejudice.
on
may
5th,
caldwell
again
wrote
the
district
--
the
chief
judge
indicating
that
the
naacp
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
had
agreed
to
pay
the
cost
of
litigation
entering
an
appearance
and
requesting
that
the
order
of
dismissal
be
vacated.
the
chief
judge
wrote
back
suggesting
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
caldwell
to
file
a
new
action.
on
may
31,
caldwell
filed
a
new
complaint
under
both
title
vii
and
section
1981
reiterating
petitioner's
original
allegations.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
several
grounds.
first,
with
respect
to
petitioner's
title
vii
claims,
he
held
that
the
interlocutory
order
of
june
14,
1971
in
the
first
action
granting
summary
judgment
to
respondent
locals
and
partial
summary
judgment
to
rea
was
a
final
judgment
constituting
res
judicata.
second,
that
petitioner's
claims
under
section
1981
were
barred
by
tennessee's
one
year
statute
of
limitations
and
also
barred
because
of
petitioner's
failure
exhaust
remedies
under
the
railway
labor
act.
third,
he
held
that
petitioner's
title
vii
action
against
rea
was
barred
by
his
failure
to
re-file
within
30
days
after
the
dismissal
without
prejudice.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
disposing
of
the
case
on
timeliness
grounds.
it
held
that
the
title
vii
action
was
barred
because
the
second
action
was
filed
more
than
30
days
after
the
dismissal
of
the
first
action
and
held
that
the
statute
of
limitations
on
petitioner's
section
1981
action
was
not
told
by
the
filing
of
his
eeoc
charge.
rehearing
was
denied.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
no,
your
honor,
that
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
we
would
take
the
position
that
there
are
independent
remedies
under
section
1981
and
title
vii.
we
--
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
asked
the
court
to
review
the
holding
that
the
plaintiffs
--
petitioners
should
have
exhausted
his
remedies
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
court
did
not
agree
to
review
that
question.
petitioner
and
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
urged
the
court
to
adopt
the
rule
of
the
fifth
and
dc
circuits
namely,
that
the
filing
of
an
eeoc
charge
operates
to
toll
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
on
an
action
based
on
the
same
facts
brought
under
section
1981.
if
such
a
rule
is
applied
to
the
case
at
bar,
petitioner's
section
1981
action
was
timely
filed
under
tennessee's
one
year
statute
of
limitations.
he
filed
his
charge
with
the
eeoc
on
may
31,
1967
while
still
employed
by
rea.
the
discriminatory
acts
alleged
there
in
were
continuing
in
nature
so
that
none
of
the
one
year
period
had
run
prior
to
said
filing.
he
received
his
notice
of
right
to
sue
on
january
15,
1971.
the
supplemental
complaint
in
the
first
action
and
that
was
the
first
pleading
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1981
was
filed
62
days
later
on
march
18,
1971.
so,
to
that
point
only
62
days
had
run
if
the
tolling
rules
were
adopted.
the
statute
stopped
running
when
the
action
was
filed
and
did
not
start
running
again
until
february
16,
1972
when
the
action
was
dismissed
without
prejudice.
the
second
action
was
filed
105
days
after
the
dismissal
of
the
first
action
on
may
31,
1972.
thus,
a
total
of
167
days
of
the
tennessee
one
year
statute
had
run.
the
purposes
underlying
the
statute
of
limitations,
notice
to
the
defendants
and
the
barring
of
stale
claims
by
plaintiff
who
has
slept
on
his
rights,
were
served
by
the
filing
of
petitioner's
eeoc
charge.
in
burnett
versus
new
york
central,
this
court
suggested
that
the
basic
inquiry
is
whether
congregational
purpose
would
be
effectuated
by
tolling
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
as
this
court
recognize
in
alexander
v.
gardner-denver,
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii
that
congress
intended
that
individual
be
able
to
pursue
his
rights
to
be
free
from
racial
discrimination
and
employment
under
both
title
vii
and
section
1981.
it
is
equally
clear
that
congress
prefer
the
process
of
fact
finding
and
conciliation
provided
in
title
vii
and
hope
that
litigation
would
be
resorted
to
only
if
this
process
was
not
effective.
both
policies
can
be
accommodated
by
adopting
the
tolling
rule
urged
by
petitioner.
bringing
suit
under
section
1981
is
of
course
simpler
than
bringing
suit
under
title
vii
as
there
are
no
administrative
remedies
that
must
be
exhausted.
indeed,
one
of
the
grounds
urged
by
the
sponsors
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972
for
rejecting
an
amendment
that
would
have
made
title
vii
the
exclusive
remedy
was
that
procedural
requirements
of
title
vii
may
sometimes
prevent
and
aggrieve
individual
from
obtaining
redress.
and
in
such
event,
he
should
be
able
to
fall
back
on
section
1981.
on
the
other
hand,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
individual
with
limited
resources
unable
to
obtain
counsel.
title
vii
is
the
better
remedy.
the
eeoc
can
investigate
and
conciliate
claims
and
can
even
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
complainant.
as
long
as
a
person
has
reason
to
hope
that
he
can
get
the
relief
he
seeks
by
resort
to
the
eeoc
he
should
not
have
to
go
to
the
expense
of
filing
suit.
as
judge
tuttle,
writing
for
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
sitting
en
banc
in
kessler
versus
eeoc
said,
“competent
lawyers
are
not
eager
to
enter
the
fray
in
behalf
of
a
person
who
is
seeking
redress
until
title
vii.”
this
is
true
even
though
provision
is
made
for
payment
of
attorney's
fees
in
the
event
of
success.
therefore,
he
held
the
resources
of
the
eeoc
such
as
their
investigatory
files
should
be
made
available
to
the
private
litigant
to
make
it
less
difficult
for
him
to
bring
this
case
to
court.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
think
the
tolling
effect
should
be
limited
to
the
same
extent
that
they
would
be
limited
in
a
title
vii
case.
that
is
under
the
standard
of
sanchez
versus
standard
brands
to
the
facts
that
would
be
likely
to
grow
out
of
an
investigation
of
the
eeoc
charge.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes,
that
would
have
been
possible
but
we've
seen
no
reason
for
bargaining
the
court
calendars
with
cases
which
are
going
to
be
sat
on.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
this
is
a
problem.
it
is
a
problem
that
has
been
raised
in
--
respondent's
principal
argument
is
that
almost
four
years
past
between
the
filing
of
the
eeoc
charge
and
the
recede
of
petitioner's
notice
of
right
to
sue
and
that
the
point
that
respondents
make
is
the
allowing
petitioner
to
file
an
action
after
such
a
long
period
to
have
worked
in
injustice
on
the
respondents.
but
congress
must
have
intended
that
aggrieved
employees
could
take
advantage
of
all
of
the
investigative
and
conciliatory
processes
of
the
eeoc
otherwise,
they
could
have
required
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
before
recess
i
was
responding
to
a
question
of
the
chief
justice.
as
the
problem
of
delay,
congress
must
have
intended
that
aggrieved
employees
could
take
advantage
of
all
the
investigative
and
conciliatory
processes
of
the
eeoc
even
though
that
might
mean
not
filing
a
civil
action
under
title
vii
for
several
years.
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
material
about
the
backlog
in
the
eeoc.
congress
could
have
required
the
eeoc
to
issue
right
to
sue
letters
within
a
specified
time
after
the
filing
of
a
charge.
if
--
putting
all
kinds
of
short
limitations
on
the
times
we're
doing
certain
things
that
did
not
put
in
a
limitation
on
how
long
a
matter
could
be
before
the
eeoc.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
i
think
that
the
commencement
of
an
act
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
that
question
is
not
here.
we
would
argue
that
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
a
statue
of
limitations
on
the
commencement
of
an
action
would
have
to
stop
running
with
the
commencement
of
the
action.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
oh,
we
could
further
argue
that
even
if
the
commencement
of
the
first
action
did
not
toll
but
running
of
the
statute
on
the
time
for
filing
that
action,
that
the
second
action
was
brought
within
a
year
after
dismissal
of
the
first
action
as
allowed
by
the
tennessee
saving
statute
which
provides
for
bringing
--
in
the
case
of
any
action
dismissed
without
a
determination
on
the
merits.
it
could
be
filed
within
a
year.
affirmance
of
the
decision
below
would
not
only
do
violence
to
congressional
policy
with
respect
to
preserving
a
petitioner's
right
of
action
under
1981
and
its
policy
of
the
same
time
of
encouraging
resort
to
the
conciliatory
processes
of
the
eeoc
but
would
also
--
could
also
have
adverse
effects
on
the
federal
judicial
system.
the
aggrieved
employee
would
have
to
file
his
eeoc
charge,
file
suit
under
1981
if
he
could
obtain
counsel.
and
very
likely
see
his
action
come
to
judgment
on
his
1981
action
before
the
eeoc
have
had
the
chance
to
investigate
his
charge.
if
he
did
not
file
suit,
he
would
run
the
risk
of
foregoing
his
rights
under
section
1981
and
running
a
file
of
the
procedural
requirements
of
title
vii
as
the
petitioner.
one
can
only
speculate
about
the
number
of
such
precautionary
suits
that
might
be
filed.
however,
the
eeoc
informs
us
that
in
fiscal
1974,
it
received
over
50,000
new
charges.
of
the
charges
investigated
and
which
decisions
were
issued,
44%
were
found
to
be
without
probable
cause.
as
this
court
observed
in
alexander
versus
gardner-denver
with
respect
to
the
conciliatory
or
therapeutic
processes
of
arbitration,
the
processes
of
the
eeoc
may
satisfy
an
employee's
perceived
need
to
resort
to
the
judicial
forum.
this
court's
recent
holding
in
american
pipe
versus
utah,
that
the
avoidance
of
precautionary
litigation
is
a
sound
reason
for
tolling
a
statute
of
limitations
is
equally
applicable
to
the
instant
case.
respondents
contend
in
their
briefs
that
the
principles
of
burnett
and
american
pipe
do
not
apply
to
this
case
because
they
involved
the
tolling
of
federal,
not
state
statutes
of
limitations.
this
contention
was
squarely
rejected
in
holmberg
versus
armbrecht
where
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated,
it
would
be
too
incongruous
to
confine
a
federal
right
within
the
bare
terms
of
a
state's
statute
of
limitations
unrelieved
by
the
settled
federal
equitable
doctrine
as
to
fraud.
when
even
a
federal
statute
in
the
same
terms
would
be
given
the
mitigating
construction
required
by
that
doctrine.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
in
response
to
rea's
contention
that
under
the
regulations,
the
petitioner's
charge
might
still
be
pending
before
the
eeoc
and
therefore
this
--
there
would
be
tolling
forever.
we
are
only
contending
that
the
statute
of
limitation
should
be
tolled
until
a
notice
of
right
to
sue
is
issued.
mr.
justice
white
suggested
the
possibility
of
limiting
the
time
for
charging,
for
bringing
a
suit
under
1981
to
the
time
allowed
to
bring
suit
under
title
vii.
this
possibility
was
suggested
in
a
footnote,
in
the
government's
brief
citing
mcallister
versus
magnolia
petroleum.
mcallister
is
not
precedent
for
limiting
the
time
for
bringing
a
1981
action
to
the
time
for
bringing
title
vii
actions.
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
fashion
a
time
limitation
for
the
bringing
of
1981
actions
as
was
done
in
mcallister
but
merely
to
determine
the
circumstances
under
which
the
statute
--
the
state
statute
of

should
be
tolled.
ms.

yes.
ms.
deborah

yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
with
the
timing
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
i'm
sorry
i
thought
that's
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes,
that's
when
the
tolling
begins.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah

yes.
ms.
deborah

in
mcallister
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
when
would
it
have
ended?
i'm
sorry
i
haven't
computed
that.
i
did
observe
that
i
think
that
a
hundred
and
sixty-seven
days
had
passed
under
that
method
of
computation,
a
167
of
the
one
year.
ms.
deborah
m.

yes.
ms.
deborah

yes.
ms.
deborah
m.

yes.
it's
not
in,
just
going
back
to
mcallister,
again
in
that
case
the
only
way
the
court
could
--
the
only
means
that
the
court
could
fashion
to
enable
plaintiff
to
preserve
his
rights
under
the
unseaworthiness
claims
was
by
stretching
or
extending
the
time
for
filing
to
the
time
allowed
by
the
jones
act.
there
was
no
event
as
in
this
case
which
might
have
triggered
the
tolling
of
the
state
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
no.
the
--
our
contention
is
that
no
time
had
elapsed
before
the
right
to
sue
a
letter
was
issued
because
the
charge
which
was
filed
based
on
continuing
violations
was
filed
while
plaintiff
was
still
employed
by
rea.
so
that
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
the
--
yes,
the
first
action
was
brought
less
than
.30
days,
the
first
title
vii
action
was
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
the
1981
--
the
first
pleading
which
included
1981
was
the
supplemental
charge
filed
by
the
court-appointed
attorney
in
the
first
action,
62
days
after
the
recede
of
the
notice
of
right
to
sue.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
that
was
dismissed
without
prejudiced.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
this
have
--
respondents
are
in
error
when
they
say
that
the
district
court
in
dismissing
the
first
action
provided
a
time
within
which
a
new
action
have
to
be
filed.
there
was
no
such
provision.
i
think
there
are
some
confusion
and
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
well,
its
not
--
its
hard
to
tell
but
what
the
decision
--
but
the
ruling
was,
that
is
judge
brown's
ruling
in
the
first
action
was,
“if
you
don't
get
another
lawyer
within
30
days,
your
action
will
be
dismissed
without
prejudiced.”
it
did
not
say
when
you
could
then
file
a
new
action.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
the
second
title
vii
action
was
dismissed
because
the
new
complaint
was
not
filed
within
30
days
after
the
dismissal
without
prejudice
on
the
grounds
that
title
vii
provided
a
30
day
statute
of
limitations
for
the
filing
of
a
title
vii.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
no.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
no.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
but
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i'm
sorry
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
i
think
that
the
title
vii
action
should
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
oh,
the
1981
action
was
timely,
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
no.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
because
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
it
was
added.
the
problem
was
that
the
first
--
he
couldn't
get
a
lawyer
the
first
time
so
the
judge
allowed
him
to
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
the
final
dismissal
because
he
couldn't
get
a
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
--
a
lawyer.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
there
was
an
initial
interlocutory
order
dismissing
the
1981
actions
as
not
timely
filed
because
of
the
one
year
statute
not
dealing
with
the
tolling
issue
at
all.
and
granting
summary
judgment
to
the
union
on
their
title
vii
action
and
its
not
clear
whether
that
was
on
procedural
grounds,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it
was
based
on
procedural
issues.
and
granting
partial
summary
judgment
on
plaintiff's
title
vii
claims
against
rea
--

just
to
briefly
get
back
to
the
railway
labor
act
issue
and
point
out
that
all
the
cases
hold
that
in
every
circuit
that
has
considered
it,
that
one
does
not
have
to
exhaust
the
eeoc
procedural
remedies
before
filing
a
suit
under
1981.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
one
should
have
to
exhaust
remedies
under
the
railway
labor
act.
it
has
been
held
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
norman
versus
missouri
pacific
that
in
order
to
file
a
title
vii
suit,
one
does
not
have
to
exhaust
under
the
railway
labor
act.
that
is
the
only
decision
we
have
found
specifically
dealing
with
that
other
than
of
course
glover.
i
want
to
address
myself
further
to
the
rea's
argument
that
one
has
to
apply
the
--
if
one
looks
to
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
one
has
to
look
at
all
of
the
state
laws.
this
was
rejected
--
was
rejected
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
portion
of
holmberg
versus
armbrecht
that
i
quoted
before.
it
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief.
and
this
of
course
discussed
by
justice
friendly,
judge
friendly
who
said
in
moviecolor,
for
some
purposes,
you'll
look
at
the
state
law
for
some
purposes,
you
look
at
federal
law
if
you
--
if
the
concerns
are
federal
concerns,
you
look
at
federal
law.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
the
circuit
court
when
in
its
footnote,
in
its
opinion
denying
rehearing
which
is
in
the
appendix
at
115,
said
that
the
summary
judgment
against
the
unions
was
res
judicata.
now
that
summary
judgment
which
is
at
page
9
--
the
order
granting
summary
which
is
at
page
92a,
no,
i'm
sorry,
yes,
at
page
92a
of
the
appendix,
paragraph
three,
goes
only
to
the
unions,
to
the
claims
against
the
union
under
title
vii.
as
we
--
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
no.
the
only
other
order
in
the
case
was
the
order
dismissing
without
prejudice.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
as
to
everyone.
the
complaint
is
dismissed
without
prejudice.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
oh,
the
granting
for
motion
of
--
for
summary
judgment
was
an
interlocutory
order
and
there
never
was
a
final
appealable
order.
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
if
you
could
get
--
i'm
sorry?
ms.
deborah
m.
greenberg
yes.
that
is
our
position
and
the
question
was
never
certified.
