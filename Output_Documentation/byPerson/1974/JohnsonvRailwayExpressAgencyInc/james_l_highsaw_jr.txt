mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
union
local
largest
of
the
brotherhood
of
railway
&
airline
clerks
which
i
represent
find
themselves
in
an
unusual
posture
in
this
case.
at
the
time
the
second
complaint
was
filed
in
may
1972
which
was
the
complaint
before
this
court.
these
two
lodges
had
not
been
in
the
case
for
few
days
short
of
a
year.
they
had
been
eliminated
from
the
case
a
year
before
by
an
order
of
the
district
court
which
had
not
been
appealed.
dismissing
the
1981
action
on
the
basis,
the
tennessee
state
--
statute
of
limitations
and
finding
that
on
the
undisputed
facts
there
was
no
claim,
valid
claim
by
the
plaintiff
against
the
two
union
largest
and
running
summary
judgments
with
respect
to
the
title
vii
claim.
consequently,
when
the
second
complaint
was
filed,
these
two
union
largest
have
made
a
move
for
dismissal
or
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
res
judicata.
the
district
court
on
--
with
another
judge
sitting
granted
that
motion.
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
appealed
by
the
petitioner
with
that
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the
jurisdictional
problem
in
its
original
opinion
and
its
opinion
on
rehearing,
the
petition
on
rehearing
after
referring
to
the
jurisdictional
problem
that
specifically
stated
that
the
two
local
unions
had
a
completely
--
complete
defense
against
all
claims
of
the
petitioner
based
on
res
judicata.
the
petitioner
sought
cert
in
this
court
on
that
issue
and
this
court
denied
cert.
now,
the
petitioner
and
their
brief,
original
brief
and
in
their
reply
brief
filed
a
few
days
ago
says
this
court
should
remand
the
res
judicata
issue
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
amicus
brief
states
that
these
two
local
unions
are
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
in
this
alternative
ground.
neither
one
of
this
are
correct
in
our
opinion.
our
position
is
that
that
the
case
when
this
court
denied
certiorari
on
the
issue
that
ended
it.
it
is
a
final
and
binding
judgment
now
as
to
these
two
respondents.
it's
the
law
of
the
case
and
moral
of
the
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
the
tolling
issue.
i'm
not
going
back
over
the
ground
that
mr.
wisehart
went
into.
but
i
would
like
to
say
this.
the
petitioner's
case
boils
down
simply
to
this.
they
say
that
in
terms
of
congressional
intent
and
public
policy,
they
must
have
the
tolling
principle
applied
here
because
of
the
public
policy
expressed
by
congress
in
the
conciliation
process
under
title
vii.
and
petitioner's
counsel
as
i
understood
it
made
reference
to
a
plaintiff
who
had
money
needed
to
and
who
could
go
ahead
with
1981,
still
needed
to
file
a
petition
and
one
who
didn't
have
money
needed
to
wait
for
conciliation
with
the
eeoc.
well,
of
course
the
one
who
has
the
money
and
wants
to
go
on
ahead
under
1981
can
because
all
he
has
to
do
is
wait
180
days
and
get
a
right
to
sue
a
letter.
this
petitioner
got
a
right
to
sue
letter.
he
got
it
about
four
years
later
which
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
which
is
that
--
as
the
amicus
brief
says,
you
have
to
have
tolling
here
to
let
conciliation
work
because
they
say
that
the
eeoc
because
of
its
caseload,
the
lack
of
money
and
its
budget
and
lack
of
staff
simply
cannot
get
around
the
conciliation.
all
it
means
and
it
meant
in
this
case
that
you
as
a
matter
never
have
any
conciliation
at
all.
that's
the
real
other
side
of
the
coin.so
when
you
finally
get
around
to
litigating
one
of
these
matters,
they
have
reached
the
point
of
being
in
violation
of
the
principles
on
which
statutes
of
limitations
are
based
of
litigating
stale
claims
which
is
unfair
to
the
defendants.
now
in
there
briefs
the
petitioner
says,
“no,
that's
not
so
here
because
they
say
the
defendants
will
have
notice
from
the
eeoc
that
there
is
a
discrimination
problem.
so
you
can't
get
stale
on
them.”
well,
the
notice
that
you
have
after
the
1972
amendment
is
one
little
sheet
paper
with
a
few
boxes
on
it.
above
all
it
tells
you
as
there
is
some
discrimination.
apart
of
that
time
you
did
get
a
notice
with
the
copy
of
the
complaint
but
even
that
didn't
give
you
too
much
notice
because
the
sanchez
case,
and
other
cases
has
been
cited
by
petitioner's
counsel
were
so
broad
in
permitting
on
title
vii
complaints.
they
had
charges
different
than
those
before
the
commission
that
you
didn't
really
get
any
notice
then
either.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no,
that's
an
alternative
basis
for
jurisdiction,
yes
your
honor.
the
facts
that
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
i
have
never
seen
a
case
that
it
wasn't
just
the
same
facts.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
it
requires
the
--
that
requires
the
defendants
among
other
things
to
be
litigating.
now,
these
stale
issues
in
a
situation
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yeah,
yeah,
in
this
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
it
can
reach
other
matters
but
usually
it
does
not
but
it
was
--
does
provide
other
remedies
which
can
make
a
substantial
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
--
substantial
difference
to
a
defendant,
complete
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
punitive
damages
is
one
area,
one
very
major
area
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
now
that
you
feel
threatened
in.
the
--
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
now
in
title
vii
that
goes
back
two
years
from
the
time
the
title
vii
complaint
is
filed.
you
can
--
you
could
go
back
further
than
that
in
the
1981
if
you
could
go
forward
with
the
1981
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
in
some
states,
yes.
it
might
be
three
or
four
years
in
some
states
so
you
would
have
much
bigger
damages
and
this
becomes
a
matter
of
great
concern
particularly
to
the
unions
where
you
have
this
big
class
actions
which
is
what
you
have.
now
you
have
hundreds
of
people
you're
talking
about.
and
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
but
there's
another
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no.
there's
another
aspect
of
it
your
honor.
and
that
is,
is
that
you're
lucky
if
you
get
a
notice
from
the
eeoc.
the
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
eeoc
violates
the
statute,
they
just
don't
serve
a
notice.
and
the
--
their
--
the
cases
hold
that
this
is
not
fatal.
i
cited
the
case
i'm
in
now.
i
couldn't
get
the
district
court
to
send
it
back
to
the
eeoc
for
conciliation.
we
would've
loved
to
conciliate
it.
we
never
heard
of
the
discrimination,
alleged
discrimination
matter
until
we
got
served
with
the
complaint.
and
the
federal
court
saw
that
there
is
no
guarantee
on
the
basis
of
the
application
of
the
law,
you
even
--
going
to
get
a
notice
from
the
eeoc.
and
as
i
say,
the
notice
you
get
doesn't
show
you
anything.
it's
a
--
it's
just
a
single
sheet
paper
with
a
box
on
it.
and
you
would
have
to
be
--
you'd
have
to
be
a
real
wizard
if
you
figured
out
exactly
what
was
involved
in
it
or
what
the
nature
of
the
claim
was.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
the
union
that
these
two
local
largest
are
in
is
--
that's
right,
it's
a
railroad
union
that
has
about
200,000
members,
these
two
local
largest
at
that
time
probably
had
maybe
75
members.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
it's
a
very
large
number.
there
is
one
time,
there
were
pending
eeoc
and
there'd
never
been
conciliation
or
anything
done
about
them,
approximately
200
complaints.
and
there's
a
constant
flow
of
these
complaints.
because
of
the
nature
of
the
individuals
that
this
union
represent
has
a
large
number
of
black
employees
and
has
large
number
of
women
employees
it
represents.
and
it
gets
substantial
number
of
complaints
in
both
areas.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
that's
right.
