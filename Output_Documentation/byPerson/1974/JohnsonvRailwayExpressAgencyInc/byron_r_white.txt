justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
the
acceptable
matter
is
--
you
could
say
that
the
statute
would
have
to
be
satisfied
within
the
time
of
the
title
vii
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
even
if
--
even
if
your
opponents
are
riding
on
the
initial
tolling
--
they
are
really
are
cutout
by
the
fact
of
title
vii
suit,
it
can't
be
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
our
limitation,
(inaudible)
do
you
think
was
--
you
almost
decided
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
even
get
to
that
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
if
you're
incorrect,
the
first
suit
was
affirmative--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
but
if
you're
wrong,
if
you're
wrong
on
that
and
the
first
suit
was
filed
at
the
time,
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
--
while
that
suit
was
pending,
the
statute
was
tolled?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
first
case
was
still
pending
and
had
never
been
decided
yet,
is
that
your
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
expire
and
the
suit
become
barred
on
it
pending?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
another
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
while
it
was
pending,
that
statute
was
tolled.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
(voice
overlap)
in
the
first
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
that
it
should
be
tolled
during
the
time
the
compliant
is
pending
and
up
until
the
time
the
right
to
sue
letter
is
issued.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
state
statute
starts
running
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
time
begins
when,
not
with
the
complaint
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
the
timing
of
a
charge
with
the
commission,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
starts
running
again
and
it
ends
whenever
the
state
law
would
say
it
ends.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
that
had
been
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
the
court
of
--
did
the
court
of
appeals
think
so
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
well,
then
why
was
the
title
--
the
second
title
vii
suit
ever
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
it
because
they
hadn't
--
that
they
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
court
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
rational
for
dismissing
the
title
vii
suit,
second
title
vii
suit
wholly
inapplicable
to
the
1981
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
then
the
time
for
filing
it
hadn't
run
and
you
think
it
should
be
sustained.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
think
--
do
you
think
the
title
i
action
should
be
sustained?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
timely,
as
timely.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
the
1981
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
the
railway
labor
act
point
which
was
first
raised
by
the
chief
justice,
we've
discussed
the
railway
labor
act
point
at
page
18
of
our
petition
for
certiorari.
at
that
place,
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
holding
that
in
order
to
bring
a
1981
action,
one
does
not
have
to
exhaust
procedural
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
was
a
second
action
filed,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
included
both
1981
and
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
and
that
one
was
dismissed,
that
one
was
totally
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
title
vii
was
on
account
of
how
it
didn't
comply
with
the
statute
of
limitations
for
title
vii.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
1981
for
the
same
reason
as
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
claim
was
--
it
was
wrong
just
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
exactly
erroneous.
