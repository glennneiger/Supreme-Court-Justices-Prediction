justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
subsequent
judgment
entered
pursuant
to
paragraph
three
of
that
order
granting
the
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
to
the
union
as
well
as
to
the
other
defendants.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
kind
of
inconsistent
with
the
granting
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
really,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
--
yeah,
that's
--
i
take
it
if
you
could
get
that
in
the
form
of
a
judgment,
you
could
appeal
from
that
tomorrow.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
get
the
district
court
to
put
the
granting
of
summary
judgment
in
the
form
of
a
judgment,
you
could
appeal
from
that
tomorrow
because
there's
never
been
an
appealable
judgment
up
to
this
day.
