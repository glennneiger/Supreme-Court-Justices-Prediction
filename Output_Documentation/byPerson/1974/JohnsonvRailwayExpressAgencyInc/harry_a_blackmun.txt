justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
greenberg,
are
you
in
any
way
restricting
your
application
of
your
theory
that
is
--
should
the
tolling
effect
for
instance
be
limited
to
the
charges
raised
in
the
eeoc
complaint
or
should
it
be
wide
open?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
it
have
been
possible
for
mr.
johnson
to
have
filed
his
1981
action
before
the
period
of
limitation
expired
and
then
just
kind
of
sit
on
it,
he'd
have
to
have
the
approval
of
court
i
suppose.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
case,
no.
1543,
johnson
against
the
railway
express
agency
comes
to
us
from
the
sixth
circuit.
it
presents
the
issue
whether
the
timely
filing
of
a
charge
of
employment
discrimination
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
pursuant
to
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
serves
to
toll
or
delay
the
running
of
the
period
of
limitation
applicable
to
an
action
on
the
same
facts
instituted
under
section
1981
of
title
42
of
the
u.s.
code,
a
statute
which
has
its
roots
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
we
granted
certiorari
here
because
of
apparent
conflict
on
the
issue
among
the
circuits.
we
hold
that
the
finding
of
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
does
not
toll
the
limitation
period
applicable
to
1981.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
waited
three
and
a
half
years
after
his
claim
of
employment
discrimination
accrued
before
he
instituted
his
1981
action.
his
suit
therefore
is
time
barred
by
the
one
year
limitation
period
imposed
by
the
applicable
state
law,
in
this
case,
tennessee.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
had
filed
his
title
vii
charge
before
that
limitation
period
had
expired.
i'm
authorized
to
say
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
and
that
he
has
been
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
brennan.
