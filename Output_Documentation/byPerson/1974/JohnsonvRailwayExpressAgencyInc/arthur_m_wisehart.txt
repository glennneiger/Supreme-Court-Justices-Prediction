mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
opponent
is
in
error
in
stating
that
the
commission
had
concluded
that
conciliation
had
failed
in
this
case.
in
actual
fact
as
page
75a
of
the
record
shows,
the
right
to
sue
a
letter
was
issued
in
response
to
a
request
from
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
case
involved
10
employees.
so
far
as
i
am
informed
the
commission
has
never
concluded
conciliation
efforts
and
it
did
not
advise
the
petitioner
that
its
efforts
had
failed
which
brings
into
play
section
29,
cfr
section
160125
(b)
of
the
commission's
regulations.
that
provision
states
that
when
a
right
to
sue
letter
has
been
issued
at
the
request
of
a
complainant
then
the
commissions
proceedings
shall
suspend.
that
is
the
word
of
the
regulation.
now,
the
consequence
of
that
i
submit
is
that
the
commission's
proceedings
are
still
in
a
state
off
suspense
and
if
this
court
is
to
hold
the
commission
proceedings,
toll
the
running
of
a
statute
of
limitations
under
the
1866
act
that
state
of
suspense
could
go
on
for
an
indefinite
period.
something
that
was
entirely
not
contemplated
by
congress
when
it
passed
the
1964
act
and
specified
that
judicial
action
in
these
cases
must
begin
properly.
i
simply
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
asserted,
that
given
the
effect
to
a
tolling
principle
in
this
case
would
be
consistent
with
the
will
of
congress
when
the
most
recent
pronouncement
of
congress
on
the
subject
has
underscored
the
need
for
fast
resolution
of
these
disputes.
the
question
regarding
the
railway
labor
act
remedies
is
that
--
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
well,
that
is
one
alternative
that
may
be
open
to
this
court.
but
it
is
not
open
on
the
facts
of
this
case
because
under
the
law
of
the
case
as
it
stands,
the
time
for
title
vii
suit
here
has
expired.
and
all
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
petitioner
--
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
that
is
correct.
all
of
the
cases
that
are
relied
upon
by
petitioner
are
distinguishable
on
that
basis.
there
has
been
no
case
holding
that
the
time
pursuing
under
the
1866
--
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
believe
this
court
has
two
courses
open
to
it.
it
can
either
affirm
the
decision
below
on
that
narrow
issue
and
say,
“we're
simply
not
going
to
hold
the
tolling
applies
when
it
would
extend
beyond
the
period
provided
by
congress
in
the
1964
act.
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
but
the
court
could
decide
it
on
that
narrow
ground.
they
were
not
going
to
hold
here,
that
it
can
extend
beyond
the
period
allowed
in
the
1964
act
and
reserve
for
another
day
the
question
posed
by
guerra
against
manchester
terminal
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
i
understand
they
are
going
to
petition
for
certiorari
on.
they
can
either
decide
--
the
court
can
either
decide
on
the
narrow
ground
or
it
can
decide
on
the
broader
ground
which
we
have
brief
in
this
case.
and
that
is
that
under
the
1866
act
which
does
have
in
it
section
1988,
congress
has
said
specifically
that
you
must
refer
to
state
law.
now,
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
for
the
purpose
of
referring
the
state
law,
you
do
refer
to
the
state
statute
of
limitations.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
if
under
section
1988
you
must
refer
to
state
law
for
limitations
periods,
whether
you
must
also
refer
to
state
law
for
the
purpose
of
tolling.
and
we
submit
your
honor
that
it
does
not
make
sense
to
refer
to
state
law
for
one
limited
purpose
when
tolling
and
statute
of
limitations
are
all
part
impartial
of
the
same
statutory
framework.
so
that
the
cases
that
do
not
deal
with
the
effect
of
section
1988
sidestep
the
issue
and
the
case
that
it
does
deal
with
that
case,
the
best
recent
case
i
submit
is
the
case
in
the
third
circuit,
ammlung
against
city
of
chester
which
was
decided
under
section
1983
and
other
section
of
the
1866
act.and
in
the
ammlung
case,
the
third
circuit
focused
specifically
on
the
effect
of
1988
and
it
said,
“if
you're
going
to
refer
to
the
state
law
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
you
must
also
refer
to
the
state
law
for
the
purpose
of
the
tolling
provision.”
that
is
the
holding
in
ammlung.
they
--
ammlung
holding
also
speaks
of
the
disarray
that
is
found
in
the
fifth
circuit
cases
on
this
subject.
the
fifth
circuit
cases
go
both
ways.
you
can
cite
two
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
our
favor
and
you
could
cite
two
cases
from
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
favor
of
petitioner
and
those
are
not
dispositive.
as
far
as
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
case
is
concerned,
that
is
dictum
because
the
court
found
that
the
alleged
discrimination
in
that
case
was
a
--
of
a
continuing
nature.
now,
i
would
like
to
speak
about
a
case
that
the
petitioner
relies
on
principally.
and
that's
the
moviecolor
case
in
the
second
circuit.
the
moviecolor
case
was
an
antitrust
case
and
in
extensive
dictum
not
necessary
for
the
disposition
of
a
case.
judge
friendly
has
analyzed
what
is
this
doctrine
of
federal
tolling?
the
decision
of
judge
friendly
makes
it
clear
that
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
case
of
bailey
against
glover
decided
by
this
court
in
1874
in
21
wallace,
the
concept
of
federal
tolling
applies:
one,
where
there
is
a
federal
statute
of
limitation,
and
remember
we
are
talking
here
about
an
admitted
application
of
a
state
statute
not
a
federal
statute
of
limitation
or
alternatively
where
there
is
fraud
or
concealment
involved.
indeed,
that
portion
of
the
moviecolor
case
that
is
quoted
on
page
three
of
the
reply
brief
for
petitioner
makes
it
quite
clear
that
judge
friendly's
decision
there
is
premised
upon
the
concept
of
concealment.
and
concealment
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
more
importantly
then
what
the
quotation
set
forth
on
page
three
shows
we
submit
is
the
language
that's
contained
in
what
was
deleted
from
that
quotation.
on
page
three
of
the
reply
brief,
it
appears
that
the
quotation
provided
by
the
petitioner
is
the
beginning
of
a
paragraph.
but
in
fact
the
sentence
that
begins
that
paragraph
reads
as
follows.
in
the
last
analysis,
decision
of
that
issue
namely
tolling
requires
an
attempt
to
divine
a
purpose
of
congress
on
a
subject
where
no
purpose
has
been
manifested.
if
indeed,
it
was
had.
now,
we
submit
that
that
language
is
dispositive
of
this
case
because
congress
has
manifested
a
purpose.
it
has
enacted
section
1988
of
the
1866
act
in
which
for
purposes
of
these
cases
reference
is
made
to
state
law.
that's
entirely
apart
from
the
concept
of
borrowing
from
state
statutes
as
a
matter
of
comity
this
is
a
congressional
directive.
when
congress
passed
the
1964
act,
it
did
not
focus
upon
this
question.
as
this
court's
decision
in
jones
against
mayer
company
shows,
that
congress
did
not
seem
to
be
aware
of
the
1866
act
when
it
enacted
the
1964
act
in
this
court's
opinion
and
the
jones
case
does
say
that
therefore
it
cannot
be
expected
that
the
1964
act
had
any
effect
upon
preexisting
rights.
that's
the
holding
of
this
court.
subsequently,
congress
did
focus
on
the
existence
of
the
1866
act
partly
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
against
jones
against
mayer
in
1966.
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
amendments
to
the
1972
act,
it's
made
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
affect
existing
rights
under
prior
legislation.
that
is
what
the
legislative
history
shows.
so
that
we
have
a
situation
in
which
as
moviecolor
points
out,
the
purpose
is
to
inquire
into
what
congress
intended.
and
here
you
have
three
evidences
of
congressional
intent.
first,
you
have
what
they
said
in
1988
of
the
1866
act
which
is
you
refer
as
state
law.
secondly,
we
have
the
1964
act
in
the
subsequent
decision
of
this
court
in
jones
in
which
it
is
held
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
effect
rights
under
preexisting
legislation.
the
third
evidence
of
congressional
intent
is
what
congress
itself
provided
in
the
act
of
1964.
and
that
is
that
lawsuits
must
be
brought
at
an
earlier
time
then
is
possible
or
is
contended
for
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
effect
of
the
tolling
which
they
seek
in
this
case
would
be
to
extend
the
time
for
lawsuits
beyond
that
which
congress
itself
provided
in
its
most
recent
enactment
on
this
question.
and
in
view
of
those
three
indications
of
congressional
intent
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
analysis
of
judge
friendly
in
moviecolor
shows
that
application
of
tolling
to
the
facts
of
this
case
which
do
not
involve
fraud
or
concealment
would
be
pushing
the
doctrine
farther
that
it
has
ever
been
pushed
before.
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
that
is
in
effect
of
what
they
did
as
far
as
the
eeoc
cases
are
concerned
under
title
vii.
they
must
sue
now
within
a
specified
time
after
the
eeoc
proceeding
ends
under
title
vii.
but
congress
was
silent
as
to
the
effect
on
the
1866
act.
you
would
ask
in
an
earlier
question
mr.
chief
justice
about
whether
or
not
the
first
case
here
had
the
effect
of
tolling
the
action
under
the
earlier
act
and
my
opponent
is
correct
that
the
question
has
never
really
been
focused
on
here.
however,
the
law
of
this
case
we
submit
is
that
the
first
action
could
not
have
had
the
effect
of
tolling
because
the
court
did
instruct
that
further
litigation
be
commenced
within
a
specified
time
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
--
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
no
you
don't.
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
except
for
the
fact
that
it
became
the
law
of
the
case,
that
further
proceedings
--
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court's
--
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
that
may
be
your
honor
except
i
wish
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
court
in
the
first
suit
did
specify
a
period
of
time
in
which
further
action
should
be
brought
and
there
was
no
appeal
from
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
at
107(a)
of
the
record
and
that
that
was
a
final
decision
so
that
that
would
seem
to
be
res
judicata
on
the
issue.
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
yes,
it
is.
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
i
think
that
one
could
infer
that.
mr.
arthur
m.
wisehart
yes.
now,
there
was
a
question
also
on
the
railway
labor
act
procedures.
the
decision
below
was
that
prior
resort
was
required
under
the
railway
labor
act
procedures
and
that
would
be
dispositive
of
this
case
even
if
the
court
should
rule
in
petitioner's
favor
because
there
was
a
question
raised
but
certiorari
was
not
granted.
furthermore,
the
record
indicates
that
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
case
in
which
the
common
law
of
the
shop
should
be
applied
and
could
have
been
applied
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
because
it
involved
the
application
of
a
system,
of
the
merits,
a
number
of
particular
charges
and
he
could
have
been
represented
in
that
system
without
cause
to
himself
unless
he
pursued
that
system
of
industrial
justice
that
is
provided
in
that
way.
i
don't
know
how
he
could
establish
that
he
had
been
damaged.
the
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
his
prior
counsel
had
recommended
settlement
which
the
petitioner
did
not
agree
with.
i
think
that
if
one
raised
the
deposition
of
petitioner
in
this
case,
one
can
see
why
his
prior
counsel
recommended
settlement,
because
petitioner
admitted
in
his
deposition
that
because
of
the
massive
layoffs
in
rea
employees
with
25
years
seniority
were
those
who
could
retain
jobs
and
he
only
had
seven
years
seniority
in
1971.
he
admitted
that
he
would
have
been
laid
off
under
normal
application
of
the
company's
reduction
enforce
system
two
years
before
his
deposition
was
taken.
so,
one
can
well
understand
why
his
first
counsel
recommended
settlement.
thank
you.
