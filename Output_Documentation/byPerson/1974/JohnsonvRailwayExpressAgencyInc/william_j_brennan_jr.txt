justice

j.
brennan,

so,
i
take
it
that
a
--
the
1981
action
is
separate
and
apart
from
the
e
--
from
the
title
vii
suit
that
might
eventuate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
that
the
1981
action
will
either
be
completely
distinct
or
overlapped
the
title
vii
suit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
--
what
difference
does
it
make
it
whether
the
1981
action
survives
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
title
vii
suit
maybe
broad
within
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
understand
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
assume
that
the
--
that
suit
is
timely
brought
and
it
says,
there's
two
counts,
one
is
the
title
vii
suit
and
one
is
the
1981
suit.
well,
the
1981
suit
either
reach
substantive
matters
or
provide
remedies
that
the
title
vii
suit
will
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
why
do
you
feel
threatened
by
the
1981
suit
more
than
a
--
separately
from
this
title
vii
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
punitive
damages.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
some
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
filing
of
the
eeoc
complaint
at
least
puts
on
notice
that
there
may
be
eventually
a
title
vii
suit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
also
use
--
it
said
that
what
very
frequently
involved
facts
that
could
give
1981
relief.
