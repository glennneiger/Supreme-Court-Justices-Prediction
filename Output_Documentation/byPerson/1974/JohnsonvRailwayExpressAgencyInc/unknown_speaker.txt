mean
at
the
time
of
the
right
to

a
letter
issued,
there
was
still
a
year?
unknown
speaker
before
the
1981
suit
to
be
brought.
unknown
speaker
right.
and
was
it
in

in
that

unknown
speaker
yes,
when
was
the
1981
action?
unknown
speaker
so
within
the
year?
unknown
speaker
within
--
alright.
then
that
was
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
was
that
the
one
that
said,
you
have
to
do
something
within
this
--
you
have
to
refile
it
in
a
certain
time?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
you're
here,
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry
mrs.
greenberg,
i
wanted
to
know,
if
i
get
the
chronology,
a
right
to
sue
issue,
an
initial
suit
was
brought
within
30
days
which
also
included
the
1981
count,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
--
unknown
speaker
--
was
added,
it
was
added.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
what
was
dismissed
were
both
actions,
when
finally
the
first
dismissal,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
not
the
final
but
--
unknown
speaker
--
was
an
initial
dismissal,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
when
you
got
around
to
filing
your
second
action
--
unknown
speaker
mrs.
greenberg,
are
the
unions
still
here
in
light
of
our
limitation
and
denial
of
a
certain
question,
2c,
in
your
petition?
unknown
speaker
they
still
are?
