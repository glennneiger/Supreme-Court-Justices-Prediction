chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1543,
johnson
against
railway
express
agency.
mrs.
greenberg
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
going
to
tell
us
a
little
bit
about
what
administrative
remedies
were
available
if
any
under
the
railway
act?
or
do
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
the
position
that
isn't
the
real,
genuine
meaning
for
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
it
takes
as
it
does
with
some
of
the
agencies
mrs.
greenberg,
i
won't
mention
any
particular
agency
but
some
of
them
take
four
or
five
years
or
more.
does
that
give
you
any
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
right
after
lunch.
mrs.
ginsberg
you
have
about
15
--
16
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
are
you
arguing
that
the
commencement
of
the
first
action
itself
told
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
question
--
is
that
question
here?
that's
the
problem
that's
been
giving
me
some
trouble.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
are
arguing
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
court
you
could
use
any
argument
you
wanted
probably
or
almost
any
argument.
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
with
that
one
if
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wisehart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
of
anything
that
would
have
prevented
the
congress
from
providing
that
--
and
actions
could
be
brought
within
six
months
to
one-year
or
some
fixed
period
after
some
described
cutoff
point
in
the
eeoc
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
highsaw.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
represent
a
union
with
quite
a
large
membership,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
know
that
its
relevant
here,
but
i
wonder
if
you
know
any
idea
how
many
notices
a
year,
how
many
complaints
a
year
were
filed
with
eeoc
affecting
people
who
were
your
members
or
are
your
members?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
very
large
number
or
very
small
number?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
suppose
this
was
something
fairly
common
to
any
new
mechanism
of
this
kind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
highsaw.
mrs.
greenberg
you
have
some
time
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
greenberg.
thank
you
gentlemen.
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
