mr.
mcalpin,
if
i
may
for
a
moment.
suppose
it's
been
a
trial
closed
to
the
public,
would
your
argument
be
any
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
mind
if
you
emphasize
the
fact
there
was
a
public
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
underlying
on
that
or
would
it
be
the
same
if
it
were
private?
i
mean
the
public
was
excluded.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
land,
i
assume
that
in
georgia,
there's
no
question
of
right
of
privacy
action
survived
in
death?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
would
really
be
state
law
question
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
statute
would
apply
even
if
the
victim
and
the
family
had
no
objection.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
in
the
statute
do
you
point
to
amend?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
cover.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
statute
does
not
make
any
exception,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
the
question.
