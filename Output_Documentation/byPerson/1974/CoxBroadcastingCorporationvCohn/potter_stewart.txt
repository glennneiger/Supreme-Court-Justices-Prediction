you
have
to
discern,
there
is
824
and
read
their
opinion
on
motion
for
rehearing.
justice
potter
stewart
where
they
do
rely
on
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
georgia
law,
generally,
is
that
a
truthful
report
of
a
matter
of
general
interest
is
--
cannot
make
anybody
liable
in
georgia
and
that's
well
settled
that
they
say
that
because
of
the
statute,
the
georgia
legislature
is
held
that
this
is
not
a
matter
of
general
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
statute
is
essential
to
blind
liability
on
this
lawsuit
and
that's
what
the
opinion
on
motion
for
rehearing
makes
clear
beginning
on
page
824?
justice

stewart
i
would
suppose
your
answer
to
justice
rehnquist
to
be
that
mills
against
alabama
is
your
case
that
would
indicate
there
might
be
jurisdiction
here
rather
than
the
citizens
for
better
austin
against
keefe
which
is
an
injunction
case.
mills
against
alabama
was
not.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
they
were
that
wouldn't
be
a
prior
restraint,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
so
correct.
prior
restraint
has
a
rather
technical
meaning
and
that's
not
involved
here.
post
--
after
the
fact,
you
got
a
criminal
or
civil
liability
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
prior
restraint.
justice
potter
stewart
don't
the
code
of
ethics
--
doesn't
the
code
of
ethics
or
canon
to
journalism
already
imposed
restraints
upon
you
directing
now
to
your
present
argument
that
this
has
some
chilling
effect?
are
there
canons
of
journalism
that
already
imposed
this
kind
of
restraint
on
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
was
that
correct
or
not?
they
were
right
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
there
would
be
that
much
chilling
effect,
would
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
also
be
that
you
might
not
have
a
name
either
of
the
victim,
if
they
were
close
to
you.
here,
their
name
was
readily
available
to
the
entire
public
including
your
client.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
wanted
us
to
deal
with
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
georgia
statute
on
its
face?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
we
could
do,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
that
case
arise
in
the
basis
of
the
law
of
contracts?
wasn't
that
a
contractual
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
contracts
law
case.
