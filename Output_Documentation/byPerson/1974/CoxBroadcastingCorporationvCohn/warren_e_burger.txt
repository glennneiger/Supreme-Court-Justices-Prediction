e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-938,
cox
broadcasting
against
martin
cohn.
mr.
mcalpin,
i
think
you
can
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
going
to
deal
with
jurisdiction
and
due
course,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
all
prior
restraint
so,
that's
the
issue
that
we're
focusing
on
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
mcalpin.
mr.
land.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
if
possibly
the
victim
was
the
daughter
of
the
governor
of
the
states
that
that
might
be
one
of
the
kinds
of
cases
where
protection
would
not
extend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
give
us
some
kind
of
an
idea
of
what
might
be
one
of
the
exceptions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
in
some
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
believe
that
if
you
do
not
prevail
here
that
the
georgia
restraints
on
publication
of
the
names
of
the
juvenile
offenders
will
also
go
by
the
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
in
this
case,
i'm
talking
about
the
general
consequences.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
it
narrower
than
that
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
victim's
name
cannot
be
protected
then
it
is
not
likely
you're
suggesting
that
it
would
hold
that
the
offender's
name
would
be
entitled
to
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
do
you
have
any
further
mr.
mcalpin?
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
opinion
in

cox
broadcasting
corporation
against
cohn

chief
justice
