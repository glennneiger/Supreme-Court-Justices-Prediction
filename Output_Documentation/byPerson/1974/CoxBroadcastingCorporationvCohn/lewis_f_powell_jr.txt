justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
excuse
me
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
minute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
who
decides
what
is
a
matter
of
public
interests?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
follow
up
that
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it's
the
editor's
decision
then
the
judiciary
would
have
no
further
function
in
this
area?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
mr.
land,
would
the
petitioner
or
appellant
be
able
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
reporting
a
court
proceeding
involving
pleas
to
an
indictment
which
named
this
young
lady
was
itself
evidence
that
this
was
a
matter
of
public
interest?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
could
not
do
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
what's
open
to
you
in
your
submission.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
there
would
be
no
defense
rooted
in
the
constitution?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
that
issue,
do
you
think
it's
been
plainly
disposed
of
in
the
georgia
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
we
have
jurisdiction
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
do
we
or
don't
we?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
this
final
--
is
this
a
final
judgment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
constitutional
--
you
just
said,
the
constitutional
issue
is
fully
decided
and
finally
disposed
off?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know
but
it's
final
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
lower
courts
can't
re-decide
the
constitution.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
how
about
this
mr.
land?
is
there
before
us
as
a
constitutional
question,
as
a
constitutional
question
whether
on
the
facts
of
this
case
namely
the
reporter
by
judicial
proceeding?
there
is
constitutional
protection
for
the
reporter,
that
issue
is
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know,
is
it
before
us?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
as
a
constitutional
matter.
suppose
we
disagree
with
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
we're
to
say
that
no
this
is
the
report
of
a
judicial
proceeding
namely
the
plead
proceedings
and
the
rest
of
it
and
the
out
of
which
came
the
report
that
the
indictment
named
cynthia
cohn
and
we
would
to
say
that
this
kind
of
publication
has
first
amendment
protection.
that
issue
is
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
why
is
it
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
isn't
it
conceivable
to
might
be
a
distinction
between
the
report
of
a
judicial
trial
which
disclosed
the
name
of
the
victim
and
a
report
from
some
other
source?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that
if
there's
any
first
amendment
protection
for
this
support
at
all,
it
would
extend
to
a
report
as
long
as
it's
truthful
without
regard
to
the
source.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
without
regard
to
where
cox
learned
the
name.
whether
it
learned
it
from
a
police
report,
a
judicial
proceeding,
word
of
mouth,
wherever
it
got
it.
you
would
say
if
there's
any
first
amendment
protection,
it
has
to
cover
the
whole
spectrum
and
can't
be
limited
to
the
report
of
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
gather
mr.
land
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
the
same
position
if
ms.
cohn
has
been
murdered
only
and
not
been
raped?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
take
it,
this
would
be
true
of
victims
of
other
crimes,
robberies,
armed
robberies,--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
the
titicut
follies?
