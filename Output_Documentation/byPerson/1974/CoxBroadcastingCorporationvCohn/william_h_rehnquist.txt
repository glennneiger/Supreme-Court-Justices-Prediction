justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
--
what
case
of
our
do
you
get
the
presumption
of
invalidity
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
--
that
was
a
prior
injunctive
restraint,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
well,
nobody
enjoined
you
from
making
mistake.
now,
there's
just
a
question
whether
you'll
be
held
liable
in
damages
for
violation
of
the
respondent's
privacy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
in
your
view,
all
first
amendment
cases
involve
prior
restraint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
wouldn't
under
that
analysis
if
you're
--
you're
always
going
to
have
some
sanctions
that
you
feel
that
you
would
have
(voice
overlap)
after.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
my
question
here
it
was
not
a
just
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
contrary
to
justice
stewart
suggest
and
i
think
you
responded
along
the
lines
i
have
anticipated
but
you
style
this
as
a
prior
restraint
and
i
have
thought
that
the
distinction
in
our
cases
was
that
a
prior
restraint
was
something
that
you're
prohibited
from
doing
in
advance
of
trying
to
do
with.
here,
there
was
no
prohibition,
there
was
no
injunction
that
you
would
be
in
contempt
of,
if
you
want
to
have
them
publish
this
and
you're
simply
being
subjected
to
damages
is
afterwards
like
in
a
libel
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nobody
is
prosecuting
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nobody
is
prosecuting
you
and
under
georgia
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
just
the
opposite
that
area
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
source
of
the
report
whether
word
of
mouth
or
police
report
the
reconstitution
result
might
be
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
juvenile
court
in
fulton
county
i
take
it
is
closed
to
the
just
spectators
of
the
general
public,
isn't
it?
