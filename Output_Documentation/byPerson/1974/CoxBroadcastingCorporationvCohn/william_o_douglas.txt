justice
william
o.
douglas
but
mr.
mcalpin
didn't
--
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
i'm
looking
at
jurisdictional
statement
page
812
and
813.
they
disclaimed
any
relevance
of
the
statute,
the
existence
of
the
civil
action
for
damages
of
invasion
of
privacy
(voice
overlap)
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
may
rely
on
it
but
they
say
that
independent
--
do
they
say
that
only
the
existence
of
the
statute
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
creates
the
cause
of
action?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
government's
word
--
say
that
the
first
amendment
right
is
an
absolute
one
to
publish
this
girl's
name
no
matter
where
from
what
source
who
obtained
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
it's
true
that
she
is
the
one
who
was
the
victim.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know
we
don't,
but
i'm
asking
whether
you
want
us
to
go
beyond.
you
said
earlier
that
you
thought
this
was
something
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
want
us
then
to
limit
this
to
a
first
amendment
right
truthfully
to
a
report
to
judicial
proceeding?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
want
us
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
how
far
beyond
that
you
want
us
to
go?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
do
you
want
us
to
go
that
far?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
think
in
this
area,
this
is
probably
the
first
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
recall,
since
i've
been
here
where
we
dealt
with
concededly
truthful
report.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
at
least
there's
a
press
is
concerned.
justice
william
o.
douglas
under
the
first
amendment
protection
to
publish
that
no
matter
where
it
comes
from?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
not
something
we
dealt
with
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
your
argument
be
any
different
mr.
land
if
the
victim
were
a
common
prostitute?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
find
any
parallel
in
the
comparative
secrecy
of
juvenile
proceedings?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
know
of
any
case
that
oppose
against
first
amendment
challenge,
the
secrecy
of
the
juvenile
statute
--
juvenile
proceedings?
