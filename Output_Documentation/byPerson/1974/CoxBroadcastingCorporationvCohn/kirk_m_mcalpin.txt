mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
before
you
today
on
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
it's
an
invasion
of
privacy
case
but
does
not
involve
libel.
it
does
not
involve
any
false
statements.
it
does
not
involve
any
deformation.
it's
clearly
a
truthful,
non-defamatory
statement
of
a
reporting
of
public
trial
in
the
state
of
georgia.
it
is
a
decision
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
which
we
complain.
it
was
a
4-3
decision.
the
majority
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
first
amendment
rights
provided
constitutional
guarantee
of
freedom
of
the
press
could
not
operate
in
favor
of
the
defendant
in
this
case.
i
think
the
factual
circumstances
of
importing
of
the
trial
might
be
very
significant.
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
minute
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
i
am,
your
honor.
on
february
of
the
19th,
you
reserved
the
right
on
jurisdiction
to
the
hearing
on
the
merits
of
today.
we
are
here
as
you
know
on
an
appeal
and
not
a
certiorari,
we've
asked
alternatively
for
certiorari.
we
are
here
under
1257.
i
think
the
--
without
belaboring
that
issue,
i
do
want
to
treat
it
briefly.
we
have
covered
it
in
our
brief.
we
feel
that
the
recent
tornillo
case,
the
snyder
case
that
is
the
north
dakota
pharmacy
case
amidst
the
finality
issue
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
when
they
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
provided
that
we
could
not
publish
name
or
identity
of
a
rape
victim
or
one
who
was
assaulted.
they
effectively
destroyed
our
first
amendment
rights
in
the
trial
court.
there
is
a
remand
but
that
remand
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
deals
with
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
and
not
the
constitutional
right
of
the
defendant.
the
remand
went
to
the
trial
court
was
to
this
effect
that
the
holding
was,
the
court
is
well
aware,
that
the
publication
on
identity
of
a
name
of
a
murder-rape
victim
and
that
is
important
in
this
case.
it
was
not
solely
a
rape
victim
--
the
murder-rape
victim
was
not
a
matter
of
public
interest
or
general
concern
in
the
state
of
georgia.
now,
that
precluded
effectively,
we
say
and
made
this
case
right
for
review
in
this
court
as
in
snyder
and
as
in
tornillo
that
it
made
--
it
precluded
the
defendant,
our
client
from
asserting
any
rights
in
the
lower
court
regarding
in
the
constitutional
first
amendment
considerations.
we
think
that
like
tornillo,
that
it
would
be
a
delay,
it
would
be
a
costly
trial.
these
considerations
we
think
there's
an
urgency
because
of
the
freedom
of
press.
we
think
that
here
is
a
statute.
it's
a
restraint,
a
restraint
on
the
freedom
of
the
press.
the
presumption
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
is
when
a
restraint
imposes
itself
by
state
statute
otherwise
on
first
amendment
rights,
it
comes
here
with
the
presumption
of
invalidity.
here,
we
had
a
reporting
of
a
public
trial,
we
have
freedom
of
the
press,
the
editors
and
not
only
the
editors
of
news
media
in
georgia
but
everywhere
where
we
have
multi-state
reporting
have
no
conception
as
to
what
the
rule
would
be.
now,
you
remember
there
are
only
four
states
that
have
similar
statutes,
florida,
south
california,
georgia,
and
wisconsin,
yet
anybody
that
publishes
a
story
that
may
go
into
another
state.
example,
saturday
there
was
such
a
report
in
new
washington
paper
saturday
morning.
yet,
in
fact
story
should
go
into
georgia.
the
press
has
an
exposure
under
georgia
law.
likewise,
if
that
story
emanated
in
georgia
then
came
up
on
the
national
news
service.
georgia
would
have
an
action
for
the
publication
possibly
both
ways.
so
we
are
dealing
and
i
say
the
urgency
is,
we
are
dealing
with
the
freedom
of
the
press.
no
one
knows
what
the
rule
particularly
is.
i
like
to
try
to
deal
with
that
a
little
bit
today.
we
say
the
urgency
is
that
the
freedom
of
the
press
if
you
say
to
extend
this
back
to
the
trial
court,
it
may
take
two
or
three
years.
if
this
is
an
unconstitutional
statute
as
we
submit
and
with
the
presumption
of
invalidity
as
it
comes
to
this
court
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
the
keefe
case.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that
was
a
preliminary
injunction
and
brought
by
--
they
are
passing
leaflets
and
blockbusting.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
but
your
honor,
nobody
else
can
make
it
and
if
we
don't
resolve
this
case
and
if
we
are
entitled
and
i
want
to
deal
with
the
factual
circumstances
in
this
case.
if
we
misjudge,
we,
for
the
next
several
years
maybe
cannot
report
anything
further
and
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
publish
as
we
complain
--
state
that
this
is
a
matter
of
public
interest
then
it
does
not
seem
that
that
should
be
delay
that
we
should
have
that
right
immediately.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
not
necessarily.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
you
held
that
a
judgment
is
a
state
restraint.
you
held
that
an
injunction
is
a
state
restraint.
a
statute
is
a
state
restraint.
it
maybe
that
these
cases
that
there
is
such
restraint
there.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
i
think
this
case
is
a
prior
restraint.
i
think
this
case
by
virtue
of
statute,
it
is
a
prior
restraint.
i
think
that
may
separate
an
immediate
injunction
from
a
standing
statute
such
our
regulation
you
have
dealt
with
standing
statutes
regulation
as
prior
restraint
so
on
the
freedom
of
the
press.
now,
i
think
that
also
the
urgency
here
is
this
decision
shows
that
the
legislature
of
georgia
now
is
empowered
at
any
time.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
in
the
second
case,
your
honor
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes
sir,
in
the
second
(voice
overlap).
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
correct
your
honor.
that
was
on
the
motion
for
rehearing.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
correct.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
mills
versus
alabama,
the
only
reason
i
didn't
--
we
rely
on
our
brief
on
mills
versus
alabama
also
in
north
dakota
pharmacy,
snyder,
and
tornillo.
mills
versus
alabama
of
course
are
the
distinction
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
law
and
that's
supports
us
but
in
that
case
it
was
just
about
stipulated
that
there
were
no
defenses
that
the
party
would
have
if
the
case
went
back
for
trial.
as
in
tornillo,
where
there
were
defenses
on
a
remand
or
likewise
there
will
be
some
defenses
that
we
would
have
and
that's
why
i
didn't
use
in
argument
the
mills
versus
alabama
case.
but
the
defenses
are
--
would
not,
the
defenses
would
not
involve
the
first
amendment.
we
would
try
to
deal
as,
it's
like
libel,
we
would
try
to
submit
to
show
that
the
plaintiff
had
not
had
his
invasion
--
his
privacy
invaded
and
it
was
not
offensive
but
we
think
that
that
question
that
that
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
trial
court,
and
that's
we
you
should
take
possibly
appeal
here.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
it's
a
misdemeanor
action
your
honor
under
the
georgia
law.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
a
prosecution
and
he
view
in
the
wisconsin
case
in
south
california
maybe
our
case
they
rely
upon
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
your
honor
we
don't
buttress
on
our
trial
argument
on
that
point.
i
would
recognize
the
court's
consideration.
it
does
seem
though
and
we
submit
solely
in
our
brief
that
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
at
any
time
would
be
--
well,
it
certainly
has
a
chilling
effect,
in
a
certain
degree
it's
a
self-censorship
on
us
that
this
court
has
condoned
in
nebraska
and
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
and
if
that
is
and
that
certainly
the
court
has
stated
that
and
we
recognized
that
in
this
area
that
where
there
is
such
chilling
effect
and
where
there
is
self-censorship
that
we
are
opposing
in
ourselves
on
our
first
amendment
right
which
we
say
is
a
constitutional
guarantee
to
us
that
to
prove
--
to
print
newsworthy
items
and
that
is
a
public
and
common
interest
on
a
jurisdictional
question.
i
would
submit
that
there
is
an
urgency
to
resolve
this
that
there
is
an
urgency
to
set
a
rule
so
that
the
press
will
not
be
in
doubt
and
if
the
first
amendment
which
we
submit
and
i
would
like
to
deal
with
it
very
briefly.
thus,
give
us
this
right
to
publish
what
is
a
matter
of
common
interest
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
the
statute
of
georgia
should
not
deprive
of
selling
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
the
state
of
georgia
has
mentioned
that.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
i
think
that
there
is
probably
is
a
--
canons
of
ethics
to
effect
your
honor,
but
on
the
other
hand
if
there
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
i
don't
think
in
this
particular
case
your
honor
that
there
would
be
even
any
violation
of
those
ethical
principles
because
in
this
case
the
circumstances
of
the
trial
itself
i
do
not
believe
what
in
any
way
come
within
the
canons
of
ethics
of
the
editors
which
we
were
refer
to
for
this
reason
and
maybe
if
you
permit
to
do
so,
i
should
probably
reach
that
point.
in
this
case,
as
in
craig
versus
harney,
this
was
public
trial.
this
was
the
trial
of
six
boys
who
went
on
trial
for
the
murder-rape
of
cynthia
cohn.
remember
that
eight
months
before
this
trial,
the
girl's
name
had
never
been
released.
at
the
trial
and
the
circumstances
of
this
trial
are
rather
unusual
and
the
result
of
this
circumstances.
at
this
trial,
these
six
boys
decide
to
plead
guilty.
one
of
them,
after
sentencing,
one
of
them
withdrew
his
plea
of
guilty
but
it
was
by
reason
of
the
father
--
the
father
of
cynthia
cohn
whose
name
has
not
been
disclosed
in
this
report
who
asked
the
prosecutor
to
give
leniency
and
to
recommend
a
five-year
term
for
these
boys.
now,
remember
he
was
not
there,
he
was
--
i
don't
know
if
even
he
is
a
material
witness
or
not.
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
asked
the
judge
to
accept
the
parent's
recommendations
and
withdraw
the
murder
charges
and
to
give
the
boys
fiver
years.
now,
on
a
five-year
term,
they
were
sentenced.
one
of
them
withdrew
his
plea
and
he
was
to
be
tried
before
a
jury.
at
that
time,
this
is
very
significant
as
you
have
said
in
the
butts
case
where
justice
harlan
said
that
if
the
person
was
in
the
courtroom
and
actually
was
present
there
and
saw
this
as
in
the
harney
case,
the
reporter
wassell
was
in
the
courtroom.
the
name
of
the
cynthia
cohn
was
on
the
indictment,
it
was
a
public
record.
it
was
handed
to
the
reporter
in
the
courtroom
by
the
clerk.
he
has
to
look
at
the
indictment
and
at
that
time
it
was
murder-rape
on
cynthia
cohn.
he
went
right
outside
the
courtroom
right
after
these
have
occurred.
after
the
case,
wassell
televised
a
report
on
the
courthouse
steps
very
timely
not
like
briscoe
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
uses
11
years
later
which
we
submit
the
question
of
remoteness
is
not
very
material
in
these
cases.
but
he
went
right
out
there
and
he
told
what
happened.
it
was
factual,
it
was
true,
nobody
disputes
that,
that's
not
an
issue.
at
that
time
he
released
the
name
of
the
girl
cynthia
cohn.
he
merely
says
that
this
time
that
the
boys
were
brought
before
the
court,
they
were
tried
and
it
was
great
interest
to
the
people
of
sandy
springs
and
then
publishes
the
name.
now,
this
we
submit
on
first
amendment
rights
that
this
was
a
public
reporting
of
a
public
trial
and
where
is
the
girl's
name
was
a
newsworthy
item.
it
was
a
routine
item
and
we
submit
that
this
case
may
have
--
it
may
confess
some
several
rules
out
of
this
case.
but
knowing
of
the
dilemma
in
the
privacy
field,
i
would
like
to
--
maybe
try
to
treat
some
of
the
areas
that
this
case
may
fit.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
your
honor,
i
said
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
it
was
a
public
trial.
there
was
no
restraints
made
by
the
judge,
the
name
of
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
the
plaintiff
makes
reference
to
juvenile
in
cases
where
and
we
comment
the
court,
we
comment
in
our
brief
that
those
statutes
--
i'm
not
certainly
really
that
that
would
be
a
distinction
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reach
that
because
while
we
say
that
those
cases
the
juvenile,
the
closed
cases
are
distinguishable.
when
you
publish
in
truth
on
non-defamatory
matter,
we
are
not
really
certain.
we
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case,
but
nevertheless
we
have
dealt
with,
we
are
thinking
about
it
and
you're
dealing
with
truthful,
non-defamatory
reporting
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
on
a
question
dealing
with
--
we
may
say
initially
created
rights
of
privacy.
then,
you
may
not
it
maybe
that
closed
sessions
or
juvenile
report
is
even
where
it
says
it's
not
available
would
not
be
privileged.
and
i
think
there
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
correct
your
honor
and
to
answer
that
yes,
sir
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
your
honor
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
under
your
--
under
decisions
of
this
court
that
has
been
held
that
there
are
limitations
on
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
i
don't
think
in
this
case
we
have
to
go
beyond
that.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
we
are
not
asking
for
that
but
i
do
think
in
treatment
of
the
first
amendment
question
in
privacy
areas.
i'm
prepared
to
deal
with
that
a
little
bit
but
i
do
not
think
it's
necessary
in
this
case
to
go
beyond
that.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
i
say
i
think
that
these
rules
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
your
honor
it
maybe
that
truthful
reporting
of
non-defamatory
matter
has
absolute
privilege.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
yes
sir.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
we
do
your
honor
and
i
would
like
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
alright
sir.
but
i
was
asked
the
question
and
dealing
with
this
question,
it
does
become
somewhat
concern
--
it
does
concern
us
somewhat
that
there
may
be
in
truthful,
non-defamatory
publications.
it
maybe
that
the
right
of
--the
so-called
right
of
invasion
of
privacy
may
not
enjoy
the
same
position
as
this
does
in
intrusion
cases,
appropriation
cases,
false
light
cases.
those
are
three
areas
of
invasion
of
privacy
that
don't
apply
here
and
this
is
not
that
type
of
case.
here,
we
have
and
the
reason
i
say
this
your
honor,
we
are
somewhat
concerned
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
truth
and
defamation
traditionally,
historically
is
absolute
defense
with
no
reference
to
remoteness
of
time.
in
this
warren
case,
in
which
you
sent
to
time
versus
hill
--
it
came
forth
to
time
versus
hill
case
back
here
for
reargument
in
view
as
far
in
new
york
where
the
circuit
court
there
said
that
they
will
not
--
the
truth
and
the
instances
of
truth
that
new
york
no
one
can
violate
that
new
york
statute
as
i
recall.
now,
truth
there,
it
didn't
say
is
truthful
today,
yesterday,
11
years
ago
like
in
briscoe,
and
the
question
there
in
every
instance
that
when
you're
dealing
with
truth
in
publications
on
falsity
defamation
where
truth
is
a
defense
as
an
absolute
defense.
yet
when
you
turn
around
and
come
into
privacy
areas
and
when
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
publish
and
to
say
--
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
mean
--
i
recognized
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
absolute
subject
the
restrictions
on
the
(inaudible)
and
the
revelations
and
things
of
this
nature.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
it
is.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
this
is
correct.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
right.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
right.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
right
and
we
tried
to
label
with
the
question
of
invasion
of
privacy
in
a
truthful
area
as
against
the
right
of
freedom
of
press
recognizing
that
this
should
be
given
every
possible
by
this
court
even
has
been
every
possible
right
with
no
restraint
or
no
impairment
at
all.
but
in
this
area
where
there
is
no
falsity,
there
is
no
fixed
(inaudible),
there
is
no
distortions,
there
is
no
intrusion,
there
is
no
appropriation,
there
is
no
false
light
and
then
this
area
then
you
put
the
constitution
first
amendment
language
right
by
question
of
this
nature
and
look
back
to
1890
when
the
question
was
raised
on
invasion
of
privacy
by
justice
brandeis
and
warren
in
the
history.
and
i
recognized
at
this
court
his,
--
in
the
sense
has
said
that
the
invasion
of
privacy
enjoys
the
constitutional
protection,
but
as
justice
black
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
time
versus
hill,
he
refers
to
it
as
judicially-created
right
and
he
says
that
if
the
courts
continue
to
try
their
balance
and
weigh
and
take
each,
you're
going
to
dilute
more
and
more
the
right
in
the
press.
now,
we
are
not
here,
we're
in
this
case
because
we
may
suit
for
million
dollars
but
it's
a
bigger
question
than
that.
it's
a
question,
what
does
a
press
know
to
publish
where
there's
truth
and
how
do
you
determine
that?
i
want
to
deal
quickly
with
that
but
hear
maybe
the
rules
that
you
could
possibly
fashion.
your
precedent
seemed
to
give
in
this
while
this
is
the
only
the
case
dealing
particularly
with
this
issue.
there
may
be
presence
which
gives
these
four
type
of
rules
which
you
might
get
employ
and
the
first
one
is
that
a
matter
of
public
interest
as
you
held
in
hill
that
if
the
name
is
a
matter
of
public
interest.
now,
i'm
now
leaving
for
a
minute
to
record
of
the
trial,
the
harney
case
but
come
into
the
bigger
question.
if
it's
a
matter
of
public
interest
or
rationally
related
as
you
said
in
employees,
and
we
say
that
the
trial
is
admitted
in
this
case.
there
is
a
clear
question
that
the
trial
itself
is
a
matter
of
public
interest
that
the
name
was
routinely
used
as
a
matter
of
public
interest.
and
therefore,
that
general
proposition
would
be
sufficient,
but
then
you
have
tornillo
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes
sir,
that's
the
next
things
i
was
coming
to
justice
powell.
in
gertz,
would
like
to
address
that
in
few
minutes
i
have
because
i
think
that's
critical.
i
know
in
gertz,
this
court
says
that
we
--
this
court
does
not
want
to
deal
with
matters
of
public
interest
and
to
make
that
determination.
yet,
you
did
decide
that
gertz
was
a
private
individual,
made
initial
determination
that
gertz
was
not
a
public
official
or
public
figure
and
he
was
a
private
individual.
we
would
submit
that
under
tornillo
and
possibly
under
the
rule
that
you
have
established
when
you
let
ap
out
in
butts
case
that
you
may
have
a
rule
that
would
say
that
this
court
that
it's
an
editor's
judgment
unless
is
clear
and
extreme
abuse.
and
i
think
that
the
question
of
public
interest
is
the
editor's
decision
because
what
you
determine
in
the
tornillo
is
you
said
there's
no
imagination
how
can
we
find
that
government
interference
with
what
the
editor
puts
in
their
paper
and
his
exercise
of
editorial
judgment.
how
can
that
not
take
away
the
freedom
of
press?
now,
in
tornillo
you
let
be
the
judgment
(voice
overlap)
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
alright
sir.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
your
honor,
it
may
be.
you
left
it
in
tornillo
that
was
his
judgment
but
i
can
see
very
well
that
there
could
be
extreme
abuses
and
we
might
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
justice
harlan
said
in
the
butts
case
and
i
just
very
briefly.
on
a
showing
of
how
unreasonable
conduct
constitute
in
an
extreme
departure
from
standards
of
investigation
reporting
ordinarily
adhere
to
by
reasonable
publishes
that
only
in
those
instances
and
i
think
this
court
should
make
the
initial
determination
when
an
abuse
question
comes.
you
have
done
it
in
miller
versus
california.
you
said
there's
no
difficulty
for
us
to
determine
what's
commerce
in
ideas
as
against
commercial
exploitation.
the
question
of
whether
you
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
roy
case,
i
think
that
was
in
monitor
patriot
case.
you
said
the
question
of
relevance
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
jury
on
standards
of
new
york
times
and
this
court
has
recognized
the
uncertainty
that
juries
can
play.
throughout
your
cases
and
the
gertz
case,
justice
powell
you
indicated
concern
about
what
juries
would
do.
so,
we
submit
that
if
you
take
tornillo
and
you
used
the
rule
which
was
referred
to
in
gertz
of
the
where
it
is
extreme,
where
if
it
danger
of
substantial
reputation
to
the
reputation
as
apparent.
and
when
you
leave
the
editorial
judgment
and
you
have
these
two
considerations
either
publication
of
the
truth,
non-defamatory
like
this
carries
with
it
if
we
may
say
so
absolute
privilege.
and
the
chappy
says
in
invasion
of
privacy
cases
has
mentioned
in
--
i
think
in
the
gertz
case
or
the
hill
case
that
invasion
of
privacy
cases
possibly
the
individual
where
in
this
case
were
there's
truth
that
he
will
have
to
stand
his
reputation
before
the
public.
now,
i
say
that
there
maybe
a
cutting
out
of
(inaudible),
of
intrusion
but
those
are
not,
those
are
intentional
thoughts.
those
are
appropriation
entry,
intrusions
and
false
light
cases.
here,
there
may
be
that
rule
or
there
maybe
the
rule
and
we
suggest
it
to
the
court
that
tornillo
with
the
rule
if
you
want
to
have
a
provision
for
review
of
justice
harlan's
rule
and
you
shall
rule
in
the
butts
case,
it's
only
in
those
extreme
cases
where
they
do
not,
where
they
depart.
the
ruling
was
severe
departure,
he
said
and
when
they
meant
to
find
about
ap
and
then
let
ap
out.
their
presence,
they
were
in
the
courtroom
that
day
they
examined
everything
like
here
and
they
made
their
decision
unlike
curtis
publishing
where
it
was
a
feature
story
and
they
had
two
or
three
months
lead
time
and
they
said,
there
was
no
finding
of
a
severe
departure
from
accepted
publishing
practices.
so
we
would
submit
that
it
is
the
editors
in
this
case
and
in
that
way,
you
would
serve
to
give
the
press
a
clear,
understandable,
and
predictable
rule
that
they
could
live
with.
right
now,
the
press
in
america
in
privacy
cases,
they
won't
know
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
be
considered
newsworthy
today
or
whether
you're
going
to
consider
it
newsworthy
published
11
years
ago
or
10
years
ago.
the
expense
of
coming
to
a
court
every
time
is
unmanageable
by
the
news
media.
and
therefore,
if
you
can
fashion
a
rule
in
truthful
cases,
either
one
that
in
the
case
like
this
it
has
absolute
privilege
but
in
this
case
i'm
talking
now
about
the
record.
we
say
we
have
already
got
that
we
have
shown
that,
but
in
this
case
to
apply
the
all
such
privacy
cases
that
the
editor's
judgment
should
be
paramount
into
consideration.
