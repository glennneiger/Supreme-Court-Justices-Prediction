mr.
stephen
a.
land
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
restate
in
different
words,
but
i
think
the
issue
in
this
case
is
and
that
is,
is
the
public
identification
of
the
identity
of
the
victim
of
a
right
a
matter
of
public
concern.
and
thereby
constitutionally
protected
or
is
it
not
and
if
it's
not,
can
the
state
legislatively
or
judicially
insure
the
privacy
of
a
raped
female
and
her
family
through
either
penal
or
civil
sanctions.
i
would
also
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
this
case
that
i
believe
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
drew.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
made
an
initial
threshold
decision.
it
did
make
that
threshold
decision
that
the
specific
identity
of
the
victim
of
a
rape
was
not
a
matter
of
general
public
concern
or
newsworthy
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and
only
after
it
made
that
initial
decision,
did
it
hold
that
the
statute
involved
here
was
constitutional
and
not
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
but
it's
the
initial
decision
that
was
essential
before
we
reach
the
second.
i
would
also
like
to
state
that
there
is
no
injunctive
relief
involved
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
issue
raised
by
one
of
the
court
member's
questions
is
an
important
one
as
to
the
difference
between
prior
restraint
and
no
prior
restraint.
and
that
will
be
found
in
a
constitutional
provision
of
the
state
of
georgia
which
holds
that
there
is
absolute
freedom
of
the
press.
i
don't
have
the
precise
language
but
there
is
absolute
freedom
of
the
press
that
shall
not
be
infringed
but
those
who
exercise
that
freedom
our
responsible
for
the
consequences
in
certain
circumstances.
and
i
think
some
reference
to
the
facts
is
also
necessary.
it
was
on
august
18
of
1971
that
the
appellee's
17-year-old
daughter
was
raped
and
she
died
shortly
after
that
rape.
six
young
men
sometime
later,
some
six
months
later
were
indicted
for
murder
and
rape.
the
murder
case
was
dismissed
by
nol
pros
or
nolle
prosequi.
the
rape
and
the
death
was
widely
publicized
but
no
mention
of
the
specific
identity
of
the
victim
was
made
until
the
day
of
the
disposition
of
five
of
the
six
cases
in
fulton
superior
court
in
atlanta.
the
trial
court
upon
dealing
with
this
case
got
it
on
summary
judgments.
the
civil
practice
act
of
georgia
is
quite
similar
to
the
federal
rules
of
several
procedure.
the
trial
court
granted
a
summary
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
on
liability
and
denied
defendant's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
it
is
essential
to
realize
when
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
reversed
that
decision.
it
reversed
the
summary
judgment
for
plaintiff
for
very
important
reasons.
i
argued
in
behalf
appellee
at
that
time
of
the
plaintiff
that
the
statute
created
a
civil
cause
of
action
and
negligence
per
se.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
not
concur
with
that.
and
now,
looking
back
at
it,
i'm
glad
they
did
not
concur
because
i
believe
that
a
statute
that
did
create
a
civil
cause
of
action
and
negligence
per
se
in
this
case
could
not
be
sustained
in
the
light
of
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
however,
they
are
very
careful
to
say
that
that
statute
did
not
create
a
civil
cause
of
action
when
negligence
per
se.
they
stated
only
that
the
statute,
the
criminal
statute
here
set
the
state
policy
or
public
policy
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
they
made
that
initial
threshold
determination
that
the
specific
identity
of
the
victim
of
a
rape
is
not
a
matter
of
public
concern
that
it
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
first
amendment
interest
that
what
we
were
dealing
with
here
is
a
civil
action
for
invasion
of
privacy.
if
we
go
back
to
try
this
case,
the
issue
is,
was
the
appellee's
privacy
invaded?
not
a
constitutional
question
at
all.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
the
defense,
yet
i
would
not
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
he
does
have
that
defense
because
the
court
is
not
preventing
the
appellants
from
defending
themselves
against
that
challenge.
they
can
always
state
that
in
this
case
their
violation
of
the
privacy
was
not
an
invasion
of
privacy
as
that
thought
has
been
defined
that
it
was
reasonable
and
justified
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
would
not
like
to
say
that
mr.
justice
burger.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
would
think
that
the
point
that
you
just
raised
if
it
was
the
governor
of
georgia
or
the
president's
daughter
or
whatever
gets
into
the
area
of
public
and
private
figures
which
i
do
not
believe
has
a
relevance
to
these
cases.
i
do
like
some
of
the
language
in
the
cases
and
particular
justice
douglas'
language
and
i
believe
arose
in
black
case
which
said
that,
it
ought
no
be
troubling
so
much
with
the
public
and
private
persons,
it's
the
matter
itself,
the
news
that
the
problem
is
it
or
isn't
a
matter
of
public
concern.
if
you
say
it's
not,
then
whoever
is
involved
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
think
not
your
honor
because
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
would
think
not
because
if
you
would
say
so
and
grant
that
argument
then
every
case
of
any
description
brought
by
any
party
would
be
a
merit
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
what
is
open
to
them
by
way
of
--
well,
number
one
is
negligence,
were
they
negligent
or
were
they
not
negligent?
was
the
specific
publication
offensive
in
the
sense
of
the
invasion
of
privacy
in
the
elements
of
that
offense?
would
it
outrage
the
sensibilities
of
a
reasonable
man?
some
cases
i
can
conceive
of
it
might
not
and
this
might
be
one
of
them.
they
might
hold
that
well
since
she
was
dead
six
or
eight
months
before,
since
they
didn't
do
it
in
a
sensationalize,
if
that's
what
they
want
to
do,
sensationalize
manner.
since
they
didn't
do
a
lot
of
things
that
i
can
conceive
of
then
they
did
not
violate
the
right
to
privacy
and
that
this
does
not
rise
to
that
level
that
shocks
the
conscience
of
individuals
or
is
offensive.
in
fact,
the
court
might
make
that
determination
before
it
ever
got
to
a
jury.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
not
in
the
constitutional
sense
itself.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
would
have
to
say
that
to
be
candid
with
you
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
it
has
been.
i
think
they
have
made
a
threshold
decision
themselves.
i
think
it's
the
same
decision
this
court
made
over
and
over
again
because
if
i'm
not
correct,
i'm
sure
member
of
the
court
will
correct
me.
but
i
do
not
recall
a
case
in
that
time
versus
hill
and
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
all
the
rest
in
which
there
was
not
a
presumption
that
the
matter
that
was
being
discussed
was
one
of
public
or
general
concern.
that
threshold
assumption
had
it
been
made
by
someone
and
presume
this
court
made
it.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
in
a
sense.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
think
not.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
it
is
far
from
a
final
judgment
in
the
sense
that
it's
only
on
summary
judgment
that
was
interlocutory
step
just
like
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
a
great
deal
needs
to
be
litigated
in
this
case,
the
factual
situation
that
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
in
so
far
as
in
georgia,
as
far
as
georgia
is
concerned
it
has
made
the
initial
threshold
decision
that
this
--
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
see
no
way
fulton
superior
court
could
turn
around
and
say
that
the
identity
of
a
rape
victim
is
a
matter
of
general
public
interest.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
that
issue
was
before
the
supreme
court.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
as
a
general
proposition
or
as
a
constitutional
procedure
or
statutory?
mr.
stephen
a.
land
it
is
and
isn't
which
is
of
course
a
weasel
sort
of
answer.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
because
initially
the
judicial
--
the
question
of
a
judicial
trial
begs
the
question
of
the
essentials
of
this
case.
it's
either
a
judicial
trial
that
could
be
anything
else.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
between
us
for
example,
i
can
think
of
a
police
report
or
a
report
of
by
word
of
mouth
or
some
other
matter
rather
than
a
judicial
trial.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
no,
i
don't
think
the
distinction
is
valid.
i
really
don't,
i
think
that
either
one
of
them,
the
girl
is
entitled
to
the
protection
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
would
agree
with
that
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
no,
i
think
i
said
that
the
result
might
be
different
before
a
jury
in
the
trial
court
in
invasion
of
privacy
tort
suit.
that's
where
there're
may
be
a
distinction
because
the
evidence
there
may
be
so
weak
as
to
not
justify
them
in
finding
an
outrage
or
offensive
to
reasonable
man
standard.
and
whereas
the
constitutional
issue
would
not
be
involved
at
all
and
i
cannot
see
that
ipso
facto
because
it's
a
matter
of
public
--
in
a
public
record
in
the
trial
in
the
state
court,
it
automatically
becomes
a
matter
of
public
and
general
interest
because
if
that's
true,
everything
that
happens
in
the
court
has
become
some
public
domain
and
the
press
confront
it
regardless
of
any
feelings
of
privacy
for
anyone
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i'm
not
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
well,
the
state
of
georgia
has
acted
on
that
regard.
there
is
a
statute
that
protects
the
press
from
which
called
newspaper
liable
as
an
exception
for
it
but
that
exception
did
not
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
applied
to
this
case.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
well
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
no
sir,
that
issue
did
not
come
up
precisely
that
way
in
this
case
and
the
counsel
for
appellants
who
are
quite
able
raised
that
the
question
was,
was
there
a
so-called
relational
right
of
privacy?
mr.
stephen
a.
land
yes
sir
and
it
was
determined
that
the
father
did
have
a
cause
of
action
of
his
own.
there
was
no
survival
and
i
would
like
also
to
emphasize
to
the
utmost
that
i'm
able
that
the
press
is
laboring
under
an
extremely
minimal
restriction
here.
they
are
free
to
report
everything
about
the
crime,
everything
about
the
incident,
everything
about
the
event
itself.
the
only
restriction
on
them
is
the
specific
identification
of
the
victim
of
a
right
and
this
in
my
opinion
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
others
especially
time
against
hill.
you
had
no
state
interest
per
se
in
that
case
in
protecting
anonymity.
you
have
here
the
strongest
possible
state
interest
in
protecting
anonymity
over
and
above
the
individual's
interest
in
privacy
which
we
all
have
to
a
greater
or
limited
extent.
but
here,
you've
got
both,
you
got
the
state's
interest
in
the
prosecutorial
function,
the
difficulty
in
prosecuting
rapes,
the
well-known
reluctance
of
rape
victims
to
go
ahead
with
the
prosecution
because
of
the
absolute
harm
that
it
involves
for
them
and
speaking
of
privacy
she
already
has
her
privacy
invaded
in
the
most
brutal
form
that
we
know
of
and
then
over
at
the
top
of
that
if
you
tell
the
families
of
victims
in
rapes,
the
families
and
the
rape
victim
themselves
in
georgia
that
you're
not
going
to
get
any
relief
from
publicity
in
the
press
and
the
news
media,
you
will
have
one
more
area.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
would
not
concur
with
that
justice
marshall,
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
well,
the
statute
has
drawn
is
a
criminal
misdemeanor
statute
and
we
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
criminal
case.
if
a
prosecution
were
initiated,
if
the
person
wish
to
waive
and
a
victim
could
in
all
privacy
cases
and
the
essential
element
is
that
there
has
been
no
waiver
implied
or
expressed
of
the
right
to
privacy.
but
if
the
victim
wanted
for
some
reason
the
publicity,
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
--
her
being
unable
to
do
so.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
well,
if
the
prosecution
were
initiated
i
will
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
it
does
not.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
the
only
exceptions
will
come
in
the
trial
of
the
case
itself
to
see
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
civil
cause
of
action
and
comes
up
to
the
test.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
no,
sir.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
don't
accept
that
although
i
think
that's
a
valid
judgment
that's
being
made
by
each
side.
i've
had
a
considerable
background
as
a
prosecutor
and
rape
cases
were
among
them
and
in
rape
case
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
witnesses.
it
was
the
difficulty
in
getting
the
victim
as
a
witness
to
report
it
and
to
testify.
that
was
the
difficulty
but
it's
up
to
the
prosecution
to
find
those
witnesses
not
the
press,
would
be
my
response
to
that.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
do
and
it
is
not
quite
so
the
juvenile
proceedings
are
not
closed
to
the
press
to
my
knowledge.
they're
not
closed
to
anyone
i'm
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
they
are
not
in
georgia.
i
can
only
speak
for
atlanta,
georgia
and
the
juvenile
court
of
fulton
county
to
my
knowledge
is
not
closed
to
the
press.
they
can
be
there.
but
there's
contempt
of
court
if
they
would
have
publish
those
names
and
i
find
a
strong
parallel
between
those
laws
protecting
juveniles
and
the
laws
protecting
rape
victims
from
this
kind
of
publicity.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
my
personal
exp
--
i'm
going
to
have
to
speak
from
personal
experiences
i've
never
known
of
any
restriction
telling
people
to
stay
out,
i
don't
know.
i
would
not
want
to
make
an
assertion
to
this
court
one
way
or
the
other
on
that,
i
could
be
wrong.
but
i
know
of
reporters
over
there
because
of
personal
involvement
in
a
case
and
then
they
knew
all
about
it
and
you
read
in
the
paper
that
the
name
of
the
juvenile
was
not
released
per
georgia
law.
and
they
also
said
the
same
thing
about
rape
case
as
well.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
not
in
this
case,
no.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
think
so
yes.
i
think
you
have
to
take
that
view
of
it
mr.
justice
burger
if
you
take
an
absolutist
view
of
the
first
amendment.
if
this
case,
if
this
restriction
in
this
specific
case
cannot
be
done
constitutionally
within
the
first
amendment,
i
see
no
limits
whatever
on
the
press
to
invade
the
privacy
of
private
citizens
complete.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
no,
sir.
i
would
not
propose
to
argue
the
protection
of
the
offender's
name
so
--
same
to
the
social
implications
and
all
the
other
things
that
go
into
a
judgment
as
to
what
is
there
is
not
a
matter
of
public
concern
on
that
present.
i've
been
disagreed
with
by
many
people
but
i
feel
that
in
this
case
this
specific
area
with
rape
is
the
issue.
there's
a
wholly
different
ball
game
from
all
the
other
criminal
laws
on
the
books.
this
is
a
specific
area
where
a
judicial
--
initial
judicial
review
has
been
made
with
the
background
of
the
problems
involved
in
rape.
in
the
evjue
case,
the
wisconsin
case
that
was
referred
to
by
counsel
for
appellants
is
right
on
the
point
where
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
said,
there
might
be
a
minimal
intrusion
on
freedom
of
the
press.
but
that
slight
intrusion
was
hardly
justification
for
its
pinning
the
name
and
identity
if
the
victim
of
a
rape
before
the
public
with
an
extreme
negative
social
implications
that
doing
so.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
no
sir.
no,
i
would
not
make
the
same
justification.
i
don't
think
it
can
follow
and
that's
why
this
case
truly
is
narrow.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
the
same
social
implications
do
not
apply
to
those
crimes.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
am
not
familiar
with
one.
i
do
think
some
of
the
language
in,
in
re
cohen
however,
seems
to
imply
the
justification
for
such
statutes
and
the
reference
is
i
believe
in
the
briscoe
case
in
california
in
a
footnote
which
referred
to
your
decision
in
time
against
hill
seemed
to
imply
as
well
that
there
were
justification
where
they
said
the
first
amendment
was
not
absolute
and
it
was
the
footnote
that
said,
for
example
the
identities
of
victims
of
rape
are
protected
in
some
states.
and
then
it
said,
in
juvenile
proceedings
the
names
of
juvenile
are
protected
for
social
rehabilitative
reasons
and
those
same
reasons
are
present
here.
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
as
to
two
issues.
one
of
them,
the
issue
of
overbreadth
that's
been
brought
up
and
the
other
one
on
some
other
examples,
and
i
might
take
those
other
examples
first
i
think
terribly
persuasive
as
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
in
commonwealth
against
wiseman.
there,
you
had
an
individual,
an
enterprising
individual
who
took
pictures
of
the
state
mental
institution
at
bridgewater,
massachusetts
in
the
most
extreme
detail.
mr.
stephen
a.
land
the
titicut
follies
episode
and
the
court
specifically
stated
in
that
case
that
there
is
obviously
the
state
of
mental
institutions
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
of
the
greatest
public
concern.
but
they
did
not
find
that
the
specific
identification
of
the
inmates
was
of
any
public
interest
and
they
know
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
know
what
you're
speaking
of
that
he
violated
his
word.
he
has
agreement
with
them
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stephen
a.
land
i
still
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
thrust
of
their
decision
though,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
it
was
that
the
identification
of
the
inmates
themselves
and
as
it
said
at
least
without
a
release
was
certainly
distinguishable
from
the
cases
that
were
decided
by
this
court
in
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
the
pentagon
papers
cases
of
tremendous
importance
to
this
country.
i
don't
think,
i
think
the
overbreadth
doctrine
has
been
met
by
the
fact
that
this
statute
does
not
and
cannot
be
used
to
invoke
indiscriminately
liability
for
invasions
of
privacy
by
themselves
that
the
case
must
be
proved
on
a
standard
of
negligence
and
that
the
vice
of
time
against
hill
is
a
avoided
by
the
statutes
itself.
the
statute
gave
fair
warning
to
the
press
to
look
out
this
kind
of
publication
was
unlawful
in
the
state
of
georgia.
we
do
not
have
what
mr.
mcalpin
said.
the
press
is
not
because
of
this
case
wondering
where
next
that
we
are
going
to
be
suit
for
invasion
of
privacy.
in
the
sense,
i
think
that
although
this
cause
of
action
might
exist
without
the
statute.
i
think
the
vice
of
time
against
hill
would
be
a
problem
there
because
they
have
no
notice
and
there
would
be
a
problem
in
self-censorship.
that's
been
avoided
by
the
enactment
of
this
statute
and
for
those
reasons
i
believe
the
case
should
be
affirmed.
