no,

it

it
has

characteristics

to
distinguish
between

reports

other

would

suppose
one

reasons

that
the

this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
that
court
sustained
a
statute
of
the
state
which
forbad
the
press
under
any
circumstances
to
publish
the
name
of
a
rape
victim.
there
is
an
initial
question
about
jurisdiction
and
we
answer
it
and
sustain
our
jurisdiction
for
the
reasons
which
we
given
an
opinion
which
is
on
file
with
the
clerk.
on
the
merits
and
on
first
amendment
grounds,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
court
insofar
as
it
purports
to
forbid
the
publication
of
the
name
of
the
rape
victim
which
has
already
been
made
a
matter
of
public
record
in
the
course
of
judicial
proceedings.
