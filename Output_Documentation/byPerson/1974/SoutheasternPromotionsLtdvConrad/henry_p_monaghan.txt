mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
thank
you.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
all
before
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
they're
all
exclusion
cases
and
we
went
to
the
appropriate
u.s.
district
courts
and
obtained
orders.
petitioner
thereupon
in
this
case
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee
and
taking
the
position
that
respondent's
refusal
to
permit
access
to
the
theater
should
be
enjoined.
the
district
court
held
an
evidentiary
hearing,
which
focused
essentially
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
the
district
judge
agreed
with
the
finding
of
an
advisory
jury
that
“hair”
was
obscene.
his
findings
are
important.
the
judge
expressly
conceded
that
taken
as
whole,
“hair”
was
not
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value,
applying
the
pre-miller
standard,
but
he
held
that
a
play
must
be
divided
into
three
categories
first,
speech;
second,
symbolic
speech;
and
third,
conduct.
under
the
judge's
view,
this
last
category,
conduct
is
not
within
the
freedom
of
speech
protected
by
the
federal
constitution.
and
that
category,
conduct,
apparently
includes
virtually
all
the
nonverbal
aspects
of
a
play.
then
the
judge
focused
on
“hair's”
conduct
and
he
concluded
that
it
was
obscene
under
state
law.
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
over
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
macrae.
writing
for
the
panel,
judge
o'sullivan
expressly
approved
the
speech
conduct
reasoning
of
the
district
court
and
in
addition,
he
went
considerably
beyond
it.
unlike
the
district
judge,
judge
o'sullivan
found
that
“hair”
speech
alone
was
obscene.
judge
white
concurred
in
a
terse
opinion
simply
saying
that
“hair”
involved
only
depraved
sexual
conduct.
a
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied
and
the
petitioner
then
sought
and
obtained
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
uh-huh.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right
your
honor.
his
argument
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
actual
murder
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
the
core
of
his
reasoning
that
it
put
in
a
nutshell
that
a
crime
is
a
crime
whether
it's
committed
in
a
play
or
not.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
the
position
he
took
and
that's
obviously
the
position
which
i
intend
to
address
myself
too.
at
oral
argument
we
have
addressed
ourselves
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
the
reason
that
the
judge
refers
to
obscenity,
his
opinion
is
in
fact
quite
confused
on
the
point.
in
the
district
court,
he
first
finds,
by
making
this
dichotomy
between
speech
and
conduct,
he
finds
that
the
conduct
is
not
protected
by
the
free
speech
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment.
it's
no
different
from
conduct,
which
had
occurred
in
the
public
street.
now,
from
that
analytical
framework,
what
he
does
is
he
says,
“does
this
conduct
violate
any
state
law?”
and
he
finds
two
state
laws
which
the
conduct
violates.
one
is
an
obscenity
statute.
the
second
is
public
nudity
and
those
are
the
two
state
statutes
he
refers
to.
but
in
order
to
do
that,
he
has
to
first
make
this
separation
and
to
take
a
unitary
production
and
divide
it
into
its
constituent
parts.
at
the
out
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
doesn't
survive
in
his
opinion.
it
certainly
survives
miller.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right
your
honor.
i'm
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i'm
going
to
address
myself
essentially
to
two
points.
one,
that
the
court
was
in
error
in
considering
this
to
be
an
obscenity
case
to
start
with.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
and
secondly
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
and
with
respect
to
public
nudity,
the
--
i'm
going
to
argue
that
that's
--
that
criterion
standing
alone
would
be
constitutionally
insufficient
under
four
decisions
of
this
court,
squarely
holding
it,
unless
i
seriously
misread
them.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no.
it
is
not
the
same
case.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no.
that's
the
first
point.
no,
my
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
perhaps
so
--
perhaps
so,
that's
not
this
case
quite
clearly.
but
secondly,
i
have
grave
doubts
about
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
butler
against
michigan.
you
have
to
bear
in
mind,
certainly
if
there's
no
alternative
form
available
--
certainly,
there's
no
alternative
form
available,
which
is
often
the
case
in
the
southwestern
and
southeastern
parts
of
the
united
states,
i
don't
think
it's
at
all
clear
that
you
can
reduce
the
viewing
status
of
the
public
to
the
level
of
children.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
exactly,
it
was
not
municipally
owned
bookstore,
but
it's
certainly
very
indicative
in
this
case
and
it
seems
to
me
when
you
use
a
standard
like
something
which
is
suitable
for
--
i'd
make
three
responses.
the
third
response
i'd
make
is
i'm
not
sure
that
the
standard
isn't
impermissibly
vague.
it
invites
an
awful
lot
of
content
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
the
criteria
suitable
for
the
entire
family.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
could
not,
if
that
were
the
criteria
used.
the
first
point
i
make
in
the
brief
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
showing
of
“hair,”
no,
i
do
not,
because
i
think
that
even
with
respect
to
minors
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
under
16?
no,
i
do
not
although
that's
not
necessary
for
me
to
defend
that
position
here.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
wouldn't
impair
the
--
it
wouldn't
impair
the
strength
of
this
case.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
the
standard
--
because
that's
--
first
of
all,
i'd
make
several
responses.
first,
that
was
not
the
standard
that
was
used
in
this
case.
the
standard
that
was
--
the
second
response
i
would
make
is
that
minors
have
constitutional
rights
to
freedom
of
speech
also
that's
established
in
tinker
against
the
city
of
des
moines
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
and
it
seems
--
excuse
me.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
in
my
judgment,
there
is
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
let's
assume
--
i'm
sorry,
let's
assume
that
it
could.
yes
your
honor.
then
that
would
not,
it
seems
to
me
in
impair
our
case
in
any
way.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think
so
your
honor.
i
would
take
decision
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
don't
think
i'm
in
trouble
in
this
case,
because
that's
not
--
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
it's
important
to
understand
that
that's
not
a
criteria
that
you're
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that
standard
would
invite
an
intolerable
level
of
content
discrimination.
i
don't
--
i
don't
doubt
for
a
second,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
city
can
formulate
content-free
standards,
some
of
which
would
exclude
“hair,”
if
that
were
the
only
point.
for
example,
it
could
take
the
position
that
we
are
not
going
to
let
our
auditorium
be
used
for
any
broadway
productions,
but
only
to
encourage
local
theater
enterprises
to
gain
access
to
the
theater.
but
i
do
think
that
the
free
speech
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment
is
badly
abused
if
vague
and
indefinite
standards
can
be
used
as
a
guise
to
engage
in
impermissible
content
discrimination.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
valid.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think
it
is.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
but
it
doesn't
involve
--
it's
a
question
of
how
much
it
involves
--
it
involves
a
line
being
drawn,
which
one
cannot
say
a
priori
will
result
in
a
lot
of
suppression
of
different
views,
it
seems
to
me.
i
would
be
prepared
to
accept
the
line
like
that.
i
could
argue
that
the
line
is
invalid.
it's
invalid
content
discrimination.
i
happen
to
find
that
case
acceptable.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
point
is
not
suppression.
i
think
that
the
point
is
the
basis
of
time
which
the
decision
is
made
and
you
do
not
want
to
permit
municipal
officials
to
make
decisions
upon
--
under
the
--
which
involved
a
heavy
amount
of
content
discrimination,
because
they
do
not
like
these
particular
ideas
being
advocated
and
any
criteria
which
fosters
that,
it
seems
to
me
is
bad
under
the
decisions
of
this
case.
in
fact,
i
know
of
no
case
to
the
contrary
in
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think
the
rule
is
valid,
your
honor.
i
would
evoke
to
sustain
it,
because
i
don't
see
built
into
that
the
perpetual
suppression
of
ideas,
nor
do
i
see
that
it
works
(voice
overlap).
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
but
those
ideas
may
be
reflected
in
older
--
in
older
proceedings
also.
i
think
that
--
i
think
there's
--
i
would
think
there's
a
big
difference
or
a
substantial
difference
between
both
of
those
cases.
both
of
--
both
lines
which
i
find
acceptable
and
the
criteria
used
here,
which
were
simply
the
best
interest
of
the
city
and
clear
culturally
uplifting
and
helpful.
i
think
under
those
standards
a
great
deal
of
content
discrimination
would
occur.
i
would
assume
for
example
if
the
play
“jesus
christ
superstar”
were
turned
down
by
--
under
these
criteria
the
impermissibility
of
this
standards
would
be
plain.
you
could
make
an
argument
that
“jesus
christ
superstar”
is
not
clean,
healthful
and
culturally
uplifting,
because
it
involves
potentially
an
attack
upon
orthodox
interpretations
of
christianity.
i
think
these
standards
are
fatally
defective.
now,
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it's
--
i
would
take
the
position
that
children
have
to
be
allowed
to
see
“hair,”
but
it's
unclear
from
this
record
what
the
situation
was
with
respect
to
children.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
why
should
they
--
why
should
they
be
permitted
because
it's
not
obscene,
with
respect
to
children
under
the
definitions
that
were
sustained
in
ginsberg
against
new
york.
i've
been
to
several
performances
and
i've
seen
a
great
many
children
there.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
i
think
that
there
are
some
plays
upon
which
adults
could
see,
but
children
could
not.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
we
certainly
are
going
to
show
it
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
we're
certainly
going
to
show
it
at
chattanooga.
now,
the
response
that's
made
to
this
essentially
standards
argument
is
a
twofold
one.
the
first
response
is
that
the
respondents
now
take
a
position
that
he
did
not
take
in
a
district
court.
they
take
the
position
here
that
the
standards
must
be
adequate
for
constitutional
purposes,
but
they
assert
that
the
standards
are
adequate.
but
it's
interesting
that
the
standards
that
they
refer
to
are
public
nudity
and
obscenity.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
those
standards
are
insufficient
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
neither
nudity
nor
obscenity
was
the
criterion
actually
used.
there
is
only
a
single
passing
reference
to
nudity
and
there
is
none
whatsoever
to
obscenity.
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
reprint
the
relevant
testimony.
the
criteria
actually
employed
were
something
quite
different.
now,
as
to
the
single
reference
to
nudity,
not
only
was
it
not
used,
if
it
were
used
it
would
be
a
constitutionally
insufficient
basis.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
not
one
of
which
is
discussed
by
my
brothers,
are
very
clear.
they've
cited
on
page
30
of
the
brief,
particularly
jenkins
against
georgia,
the
recent
obscenity
opinion,
california
against
larue
where
this
court
recognized
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
nudity
which
occurs
in
a
barroom
or
a
public
street
and
nudity
occurring
in
a
play.
in
my
judgment,
nudity
relevant
to
a
dramatic
performance
cannot
constitute
a
per
se
basis
for
prohibition
and
it's
far
too
late
in
the
day
to
argue
otherwise.
now,
we
think
that
what
we
have
said
entitles
us
to
a
judgment
directing
that
the
respondents
make
the
municipal
auditorium
available
for
the
production
of
“hair.”
but
it's
possible
that
on
remand
that
this
court
might
conclude
that
the
respondent's
use
of
improper
standards
does
not
now
foreclose
them
from
using
proper
standards
such
as
obscenity.
respondent's
counsel
certainly
insists
upon
that
position
and
it
takes
the
position
he
cannot
enter
into
any
kind
of
a
contract
with
respect
to
quoted
“obscene
play.”
in
the
new
tennessee
obscenity
legislation,
quoted
in
this
brief
would
support
them.
and
so
it
would
appear
that
the
question
of
obscenity
is
not
avoided
even
if
the
court
agrees
with
petitioner
that
the
standards
used
were
ultimately
bad.
since
on
remand,
the
respondents
are
going
to
press
obscenity
as
a
basis
for
denying
access
to
“hair”
and
the
lower
courts
are
going
to
sustain
that
position.
we
therefore
urge
this
court
to
address
itself
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standards,
not
only
to
waste
--
not
only
to
prevent
a
waste
of
resources
and
judicial
economy,
but
because
of
the
widespread
public
interest
in
resolving
this
issue.
there
are
very
few
plays
that
can
afford
the
expensive
litigation
all
the
way
to
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
do
we
attack
it
--
we
attack
it
--
we
attack
it
as
applied,
yes
we
do.
our
position
stated
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
the
only
criteria
you
can
use
with
respect
to
a
play
is
obscenity
and
if
this
--
i
guess
you're
raising
two
points
really.
under
state
law,
we
would
think
that
the
statute
plainly
applicable,
we're
not
in
a
public
street,
we're
not
in
a
public
place
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
if
we're
in
a
public
place
then
the
statute
that
as
applied,
if
it
purports
to
dispense
with
any
showing
of
--
any
showing
of
obscenity
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
already
make
that
clear.
the
decisions
quoted
in
our
brief
on
page
30
indicate
that
nudity
per
se
can't
be
treated
as
the
equivalent
of
obscenity
and
we
take
the
position
here
that
no
standard
other
than
obscenity
can
be
used.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
actually
stole
it?
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no
and
i
think
we
can
distinguish
that
case,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
address
myself
to
that
question
when
i
got
to
the
issue
of
obscenity.
it's
distinguishable
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
actual
stealing
of
money
has
no
communicative
aspect
to
it.
it
is
not
expressive
conduct
as
i
understand
the
meaning
of
the
term.
and
secondly,
if
it
were
expressive
conduct
and
therefore
arguably
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
there
would
be
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
repression
of
that
conduct,
but
the
position
that
we
take
with
respect
to
nudity
is
that
if
it
has
dramatic
significance,
then
the
only
basis
upon
which
it
can
be
repressed
is
upon
a
showing
of
obscenity.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
it's
never
been
thought
your
honor.
so
we
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
the
right
the
difference
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
--
because
there's
no
difference
between
the
clothes
case
and
the
non-clothes
case,
as
your
honor
points
out,
because
it's
never
been
treated
to
be
expressive
conduct
under
definition.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
to
be
--
the
circuit
courts
are
evenly
divided
on
that.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
by
--
by
several
--
by
several
courts
of
appeal
but
sometimes
the
case
gets
put
on
invasions
of
privacy
as
the
first
circuit
case
did
by
judge
coffin.
maybe
i
don't
address
myself
directly
to
your
point
right
now.
i
did
have
one
other
minor
point
to
make
and
that
is
this
case
is
not
rendered
moot
here
by
the
new
tennessee
obscenity
legislation,
which
was
passed
after
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
court
because
in
our
judgment,
the
difficulty
in
the
case
is
not
with
the
tennessee
statute,
but
with
the
interpretations
of
the
constitution
sustained
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
to
put
differently,
all
the
tennessee
statute
does
is
it
embodies
the
miller
criteria
of
what
can
be
suppressed
and
we
now
have
an
authoritative
ruling
from
the
lower
federal
courts
that
this
can
be
suppressed
under
miller.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
can
be,
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
can
be
because
the
rehearing
petition
en
banc
was
denied.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
after
your
decision
in
miller,
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
with
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
it
was
--
and
the
petition
was
denied.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
we
argued
miller.
we
argued
among
other
things
the
decision
was
wrong
and
then
we
argued
that
was
even
clearly
wrong
under
miller
and
the
petition
was
denied.
two
judge
--
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied,
two
judges
dissenting
and
then
the
panel
denied
a
rehearing.
so,
the
sixth
circuit
has
expressed
itself
in
the
context
of
the
miller
case.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
not
protected,
it
has
no
dramatic
relevance
and
it's
not
expressive
conduct.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i've
never
seen
any
at
that
level.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
maybe
and
if
there
are--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
maybe
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
it's
beyond
me,
i
must
say
i
haven't
seen
it.
i
would
like
to
try
and
address
the
issue
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i'd
like
to
try
to
address
that
issue
which
i
think
is
--
which
is
at
the
core
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
questioning.
i
think
what
you
have
and
the
way
i
would
do
it
as
follows.
the
judge
found
that
the
play
was
obscene
because
he
was
able,
he
thought
to
separate
a
play
into
three
parts,
speech
by
which
he
meant
no
more
than
the
dialog,
symbolic
speech
which
he
said
was
speech
illustrative
of
the
dialog
and
conduct
and
now
there's
considerable
confusion
in
that
categorization,
but
if
i
understand
them
correctly,
all
the
nonverbal
aspects
of
the
play
are
conduct.
in
any
--
in
any
setup
of
this
trichotomy
and
then
he
began
to
hold
that
“hairs'”
conduct
was
obscene.
now,
to
put
it
differently,
the
judge
treats
a
play
as
though
were
little
more
than
a
combination
of
a
book
and
some
conduct.
the
book,
that
is
to
say
the
libretto
was
protected
speech
under
the
first
amendment,
but
the
conduct
is
not.
it's
wholly
outside
the
area
of
the
first
amendment.
this
permits
the
judge
to
view
the
conduct
in
isolation.
he
doesn't
have
to
address
himself
to
the
dramatic
relevance
of
the
conduct.
he
simply
says,
“this
conduct
whether
it
occurs
on
the
stage
or
whether
it
occurs
out
in
the
public
street
is
the
same
conduct.
we
concede
that
nudity
in
a
public
street
is
not
protected.”
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
the
evidentiary
point
we
take
the
position
that
the
conduct
itself
was
not
obscene
and
in
the
last
point
of
the
brief
we
argue
that
there's
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
do
i
think
you
can?
no,
i
think
you
can
make
a
determination
that
it's
not
obscene
without
seeing
the
play.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
none
of
the
judges
except
judge
mcrae.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
who
voted
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
do
not.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
is
not
hardcore
pornography,
i
think--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think
that
the
basic
error
made
was
that
the
judge
simply
misunderstood
the
appropriate
criteria
and
it
led
him
into
all
sorts
of
errors.
he
equated
conduct
which
occurs
in
the
theater
with
--
and
has
dramatic
relevance
which
is
--
which
is
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
classic
form
of
expressive
conduct
as
a
play.
this
court
has
struggled
over
and
over
with
the
attempts
at
which
conduct
is
going
to
be
characterized
by
speech
and
then
brought
into
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
i
put
it
to
the
court
that
theater
is
the
classic
form
of
expressive
conduct
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes
it
can,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
if
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
criteria
set
down
in
the
miller
case.
the
point
that
we're
making
is
that
you
treat
the
play
as
a
unitary
production
first.
this
doesn't
mean
that
what
occurs
in
a
play
is
beyond
regulation.
a
sufficiently
compelling
governmental
interest
will
permit
regulation
of
the
conduct
aspects
of
a
play.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
don't
think
there's
a
great
deal.
i
mean
there's
no
reason
to
treat
them
as
though
they
were
totally
distinct,
but
where
the
governmental
interest
is
morality
and
the
state
regulation
focuses
on
either
nudity
or
simulated
sex,
it
seems
to
us
that
obscenity
criteria
must
be
satisfied.
now,
i
have
expected
to
--
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
i
would
be
forced
to
take
to
position
that
this
means
that
actual
sex
has
to
take
place
on
the
stage.
well,
fortunately
that's
not
this
case
and
i
don't
find
myself
the
best
advocate
for
it,
but
i
think
that
you
can't
take
--
make
principal
distinctions
between
actual
and
simulated
sex
and
all
this
case
apart
from
its
nudity
involved
is
a
simulated
sex.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
two
differences,
i'm
not
sure
that
they're
sound
in
the
end,
but
they
seem
to
me
to
be
--
to
be
very
significantly
different.
first,
there's
no
case
in
this
court
so
far
as
i
know
which
holds
that
nudity,
i
mean,
actual
sex
is
protected
expressive
conduct
under
the
first
amendment.
it
does
seem
to
me
too
late
in
the
day
to
take
the
position
that
no
simulated
sex
is
protected
and
once
you
--
and
at
least
the
line
becomes
clear
what
is
actual
sex
is
considerably
clearer
than
what
a
simulated
sex
and
once
the
concession
is
made
that
some
simulated
sex
is
protected,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
some
--
some
simulated
sex
maybe
put
down
if
it
gets
to
the
stage
are
being
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
it
does
not
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
--
what
that
does
is
to
say
that
this
kind
of
material
can
be
denominated
patently
offensive
erotic
material,
but
you're
still
left
with
the
serious
redeeming
social
value
test.
the
miller
case
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that
test,
i
think,
is
alive
and
well.
it
specifically
retained
in
your
opinions
and
if
that
weren't
the
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
would
be
virtually
wiped
out
in
the
area
of
nonverbal
descriptions
of
sex
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
make
clear
the
serious
social
value
test.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it's
serious
--
it
satisfies
all
those
requirements.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
no,
it's
not
utterly.
the
last
point
i
would
say
is
that
i
have
that
simulated
sex
is
necessarily
expressive
conduct.
it's
hard
to
see
that
actual
sex
really
is.
ordinarily,
the
simulation
will
take
care
of
everything
which
the
actual
sex
would
do.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
actual
nudity,
but
i
explained
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
response
i
would
make
is
twofold.
you've
accepted
essentially
the
argument
we've
made
with
respect
to
simulated
sex
and
with
respect
to
nudity,
the
only
standard
that
can
be
used
is
obscenity,
the
only
standard
that
can
be
used
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i'm
saying
it
is
constitutionally
invalid
in
the
context
of
a
dramatic
performance
and
i
would
cite
to
your
honor
the
cases
that
are
cited
on
page
30
of
our
brief,
four
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
it's
never
been
understood.
some
line
has
to
be
drawn
and
some
line
derived
from
common
sense,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
has
to
be
applied
with
respect
to
the
point
at
which
you're
going
to
stop
labeling
conduct
speech.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
is
we
have
never
treated
expressive
conduct
--
we
have
never
treated
walking
around
nude.
there's
no
decision
from
this
court
which
would
suggest
the
conduct
like
that
is
understood
to
communicate
anything
whereas
in
a
play,
that's
quite
different,
it's
a
common
comprehensible
form
of
communication
in
a
context
of
a
dramatic
performance.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
in
a
different
--
there
different
state
interest,
yes.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
don't
know
that
anybody
understand
what
she
was
doing,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
thank
you.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
all
before
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
they're
all
exclusion
cases
and
we
went
to
the
appropriate
u.s.
district
courts
and
obtained
orders.
petitioner
thereupon
in
this
case
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee
and
taking
the
position
that
respondent's
refusal
to
permit
access
to
the
theater
should
be
enjoined.
the
district
court
held
an
evidentiary
hearing,
which
focused
essentially
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
the
district
judge
agreed
with
the
finding
of
an
advisory
jury
that
“hair”
was
obscene.
his
findings
are
important.
the
judge
expressly
conceded
that
taken
as
whole,
“hair”
was
not
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value,
applying
the
pre-miller
standard,
but
he
held
that
a
play
must
be
divided
into
three
categories
first,
speech;
second,
symbolic
speech;
and
third,
conduct.
under
the
judge's
view,
this
last
category,
conduct
is
not
within
the
freedom
of
speech
protected
by
the
federal
constitution.
and
that
category,
conduct,
apparently
includes
virtually
all
the
nonverbal
aspects
of
a
play.
then
the
judge
focused
on
“hair's”
conduct
and
he
concluded
that
it
was
obscene
under
state
law.
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
over
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
macrae.
writing
for
the
panel,
judge
o'sullivan
expressly
approved
the
speech
conduct
reasoning
of
the
district
court
and
in
addition,
he
went
considerably
beyond
it.
unlike
the
district
judge,
judge
o'sullivan
found
that
“hair”
speech
alone
was
obscene.
judge
white
concurred
in
a
terse
opinion
simply
saying
that
“hair”
involved
only
depraved
sexual
conduct.
a
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied
and
the
petitioner
then
sought
and
obtained
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
uh-huh.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right
your
honor.
his
argument
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
actual
murder
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
the
core
of
his
reasoning
that
it
put
in
a
nutshell
that
a
crime
is
a
crime
whether
it's
committed
in
a
play
or
not.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
the
position
he
took
and
that's
obviously
the
position
which
i
intend
to
address
myself
too.
at
oral
argument
we
have
addressed
ourselves
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
the
reason
that
the
judge
refers
to
obscenity,
his
opinion
is
in
fact
quite
confused
on
the
point.
in
the
district
court,
he
first
finds,
by
making
this
dichotomy
between
speech
and
conduct,
he
finds
that
the
conduct
is
not
protected
by
the
free
speech
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment.
it's
no
different
from
conduct,
which
had
occurred
in
the
public
street.
now,
from
that
analytical
framework,
what
he
does
is
he
says,
“does
this
conduct
violate
any
state
law?”
and
he
finds
two
state
laws
which
the
conduct
violates.
one
is
an
obscenity
statute.
the
second
is
public
nudity
and
those
are
the
two
state
statutes
he
refers
to.
but
in
order
to
do
that,
he
has
to
first
make
this
separation
and
to
take
a
unitary
production
and
divide
it
into
its
constituent
parts.
at
the
out
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
doesn't
survive
in
his
opinion.
it
certainly
survives
miller.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right
your
honor.
i'm
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i'm
going
to
address
myself
essentially
to
two
points.
one,
that
the
court
was
in
error
in
considering
this
to
be
an
obscenity
case
to
start
with.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
and
secondly
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
and
with
respect
to
public
nudity,
the
--
i'm
going
to
argue
that
that's
--
that
criterion
standing
alone
would
be
constitutionally
insufficient
under
four
decisions
of
this
court,
squarely
holding
it,
unless
i
seriously
misread
them.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no.
it
is
not
the
same
case.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no.
that's
the
first
point.
no,
my
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
perhaps
so
--
perhaps
so,
that's
not
this
case
quite
clearly.
but
secondly,
i
have
grave
doubts
about
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
butler
against
michigan.
you
have
to
bear
in
mind,
certainly
if
there's
no
alternative
form
available
--
certainly,
there's
no
alternative
form
available,
which
is
often
the
case
in
the
southwestern
and
southeastern
parts
of
the
united
states,
i
don't
think
it's
at
all
clear
that
you
can
reduce
the
viewing
status
of
the
public
to
the
level
of
children.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
exactly,
it
was
not
municipally
owned
bookstore,
but
it's
certainly
very
indicative
in
this
case
and
it
seems
to
me
when
you
use
a
standard
like
something
which
is
suitable
for
--
i'd
make
three
responses.
the
third
response
i'd
make
is
i'm
not
sure
that
the
standard
isn't
impermissibly
vague.
it
invites
an
awful
lot
of
content
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
the
criteria
suitable
for
the
entire
family.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
could
not,
if
that
were
the
criteria
used.
the
first
point
i
make
in
the
brief
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
showing
of
“hair,”
no,
i
do
not,
because
i
think
that
even
with
respect
to
minors
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
under
16?
no,
i
do
not
although
that's
not
necessary
for
me
to
defend
that
position
here.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
wouldn't
impair
the
--
it
wouldn't
impair
the
strength
of
this
case.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
the
standard
--
because
that's
--
first
of
all,
i'd
make
several
responses.
first,
that
was
not
the
standard
that
was
used
in
this
case.
the
standard
that
was
--
the
second
response
i
would
make
is
that
minors
have
constitutional
rights
to
freedom
of
speech
also
that's
established
in
tinker
against
the
city
of
des
moines
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
and
it
seems
--
excuse
me.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
in
my
judgment,
there
is
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
let's
assume
--
i'm
sorry,
let's
assume
that
it
could.
yes
your
honor.
then
that
would
not,
it
seems
to
me
in
impair
our
case
in
any
way.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think
so
your
honor.
i
would
take
decision
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
don't
think
i'm
in
trouble
in
this
case,
because
that's
not
--
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
it's
important
to
understand
that
that's
not
a
criteria
that
you're
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that
standard
would
invite
an
intolerable
level
of
content
discrimination.
i
don't
--
i
don't
doubt
for
a
second,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
city
can
formulate
content-free
standards,
some
of
which
would
exclude
“hair,”
if
that
were
the
only
point.
for
example,
it
could
take
the
position
that
we
are
not
going
to
let
our
auditorium
be
used
for
any
broadway
productions,
but
only
to
encourage
local
theater
enterprises
to
gain
access
to
the
theater.
but
i
do
think
that
the
free
speech
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment
is
badly
abused
if
vague
and
indefinite
standards
can
be
used
as
a
guise
to
engage
in
impermissible
content
discrimination.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
valid.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think
it
is.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
but
it
doesn't
involve
--
it's
a
question
of
how
much
it
involves
--
it
involves
a
line
being
drawn,
which
one
cannot
say
a
priori
will
result
in
a
lot
of
suppression
of
different
views,
it
seems
to
me.
i
would
be
prepared
to
accept
the
line
like
that.
i
could
argue
that
the
line
is
invalid.
it's
invalid
content
discrimination.
i
happen
to
find
that
case
acceptable.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
point
is
not
suppression.
i
think
that
the
point
is
the
basis
of
time
which
the
decision
is
made
and
you
do
not
want
to
permit
municipal
officials
to
make
decisions
upon
--
under
the
--
which
involved
a
heavy
amount
of
content
discrimination,
because
they
do
not
like
these
particular
ideas
being
advocated
and
any
criteria
which
fosters
that,
it
seems
to
me
is
bad
under
the
decisions
of
this
case.
in
fact,
i
know
of
no
case
to
the
contrary
in
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think
the
rule
is
valid,
your
honor.
i
would
evoke
to
sustain
it,
because
i
don't
see
built
into
that
the
perpetual
suppression
of
ideas,
nor
do
i
see
that
it
works
(voice
overlap).
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
but
those
ideas
may
be
reflected
in
older
--
in
older
proceedings
also.
i
think
that
--
i
think
there's
--
i
would
think
there's
a
big
difference
or
a
substantial
difference
between
both
of
those
cases.
both
of
--
both
lines
which
i
find
acceptable
and
the
criteria
used
here,
which
were
simply
the
best
interest
of
the
city
and
clear
culturally
uplifting
and
helpful.
i
think
under
those
standards
a
great
deal
of
content
discrimination
would
occur.
i
would
assume
for
example
if
the
play
“jesus
christ
superstar”
were
turned
down
by
--
under
these
criteria
the
impermissibility
of
this
standards
would
be
plain.
you
could
make
an
argument
that
“jesus
christ
superstar”
is
not
clean,
healthful
and
culturally
uplifting,
because
it
involves
potentially
an
attack
upon
orthodox
interpretations
of
christianity.
i
think
these
standards
are
fatally
defective.
now,
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it's
--
i
would
take
the
position
that
children
have
to
be
allowed
to
see
“hair,”
but
it's
unclear
from
this
record
what
the
situation
was
with
respect
to
children.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
why
should
they
--
why
should
they
be
permitted
because
it's
not
obscene,
with
respect
to
children
under
the
definitions
that
were
sustained
in
ginsberg
against
new
york.
i've
been
to
several
performances
and
i've
seen
a
great
many
children
there.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
i
think
that
there
are
some
plays
upon
which
adults
could
see,
but
children
could
not.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
we
certainly
are
going
to
show
it
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
we're
certainly
going
to
show
it
at
chattanooga.
now,
the
response
that's
made
to
this
essentially
standards
argument
is
a
twofold
one.
the
first
response
is
that
the
respondents
now
take
a
position
that
he
did
not
take
in
a
district
court.
they
take
the
position
here
that
the
standards
must
be
adequate
for
constitutional
purposes,
but
they
assert
that
the
standards
are
adequate.
but
it's
interesting
that
the
standards
that
they
refer
to
are
public
nudity
and
obscenity.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
those
standards
are
insufficient
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
neither
nudity
nor
obscenity
was
the
criterion
actually
used.
there
is
only
a
single
passing
reference
to
nudity
and
there
is
none
whatsoever
to
obscenity.
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
reprint
the
relevant
testimony.
the
criteria
actually
employed
were
something
quite
different.
now,
as
to
the
single
reference
to
nudity,
not
only
was
it
not
used,
if
it
were
used
it
would
be
a
constitutionally
insufficient
basis.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
not
one
of
which
is
discussed
by
my
brothers,
are
very
clear.
they've
cited
on
page
30
of
the
brief,
particularly
jenkins
against
georgia,
the
recent
obscenity
opinion,
california
against
larue
where
this
court
recognized
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
nudity
which
occurs
in
a
barroom
or
a
public
street
and
nudity
occurring
in
a
play.
in
my
judgment,
nudity
relevant
to
a
dramatic
performance
cannot
constitute
a
per
se
basis
for
prohibition
and
it's
far
too
late
in
the
day
to
argue
otherwise.
now,
we
think
that
what
we
have
said
entitles
us
to
a
judgment
directing
that
the
respondents
make
the
municipal
auditorium
available
for
the
production
of
“hair.”
but
it's
possible
that
on
remand
that
this
court
might
conclude
that
the
respondent's
use
of
improper
standards
does
not
now
foreclose
them
from
using
proper
standards
such
as
obscenity.
respondent's
counsel
certainly
insists
upon
that
position
and
it
takes
the
position
he
cannot
enter
into
any
kind
of
a
contract
with
respect
to
quoted
“obscene
play.”
in
the
new
tennessee
obscenity
legislation,
quoted
in
this
brief
would
support
them.
and
so
it
would
appear
that
the
question
of
obscenity
is
not
avoided
even
if
the
court
agrees
with
petitioner
that
the
standards
used
were
ultimately
bad.
since
on
remand,
the
respondents
are
going
to
press
obscenity
as
a
basis
for
denying
access
to
“hair”
and
the
lower
courts
are
going
to
sustain
that
position.
we
therefore
urge
this
court
to
address
itself
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standards,
not
only
to
waste
--
not
only
to
prevent
a
waste
of
resources
and
judicial
economy,
but
because
of
the
widespread
public
interest
in
resolving
this
issue.
there
are
very
few
plays
that
can
afford
the
expensive
litigation
all
the
way
to
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
do
we
attack
it
--
we
attack
it
--
we
attack
it
as
applied,
yes
we
do.
our
position
stated
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
the
only
criteria
you
can
use
with
respect
to
a
play
is
obscenity
and
if
this
--
i
guess
you're
raising
two
points
really.
under
state
law,
we
would
think
that
the
statute
plainly
applicable,
we're
not
in
a
public
street,
we're
not
in
a
public
place
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
if
we're
in
a
public
place
then
the
statute
that
as
applied,
if
it
purports
to
dispense
with
any
showing
of
--
any
showing
of
obscenity
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
already
make
that
clear.
the
decisions
quoted
in
our
brief
on
page
30
indicate
that
nudity
per
se
can't
be
treated
as
the
equivalent
of
obscenity
and
we
take
the
position
here
that
no
standard
other
than
obscenity
can
be
used.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
actually
stole
it?
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no
and
i
think
we
can
distinguish
that
case,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
address
myself
to
that
question
when
i
got
to
the
issue
of
obscenity.
it's
distinguishable
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
actual
stealing
of
money
has
no
communicative
aspect
to
it.
it
is
not
expressive
conduct
as
i
understand
the
meaning
of
the
term.
and
secondly,
if
it
were
expressive
conduct
and
therefore
arguably
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
there
would
be
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
repression
of
that
conduct,
but
the
position
that
we
take
with
respect
to
nudity
is
that
if
it
has
dramatic
significance,
then
the
only
basis
upon
which
it
can
be
repressed
is
upon
a
showing
of
obscenity.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
it's
never
been
thought
your
honor.
so
we
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
the
right
the
difference
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
--
because
there's
no
difference
between
the
clothes
case
and
the
non-clothes
case,
as
your
honor
points
out,
because
it's
never
been
treated
to
be
expressive
conduct
under
definition.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
to
be
--
the
circuit
courts
are
evenly
divided
on
that.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
by
--
by
several
--
by
several
courts
of
appeal
but
sometimes
the
case
gets
put
on
invasions
of
privacy
as
the
first
circuit
case
did
by
judge
coffin.
maybe
i
don't
address
myself
directly
to
your
point
right
now.
i
did
have
one
other
minor
point
to
make
and
that
is
this
case
is
not
rendered
moot
here
by
the
new
tennessee
obscenity
legislation,
which
was
passed
after
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
court
because
in
our
judgment,
the
difficulty
in
the
case
is
not
with
the
tennessee
statute,
but
with
the
interpretations
of
the
constitution
sustained
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
to
put
differently,
all
the
tennessee
statute
does
is
it
embodies
the
miller
criteria
of
what
can
be
suppressed
and
we
now
have
an
authoritative
ruling
from
the
lower
federal
courts
that
this
can
be
suppressed
under
miller.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
can
be,
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
can
be
because
the
rehearing
petition
en
banc
was
denied.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
after
your
decision
in
miller,
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
with
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
it
was
--
and
the
petition
was
denied.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
we
argued
miller.
we
argued
among
other
things
the
decision
was
wrong
and
then
we
argued
that
was
even
clearly
wrong
under
miller
and
the
petition
was
denied.
two
judge
--
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied,
two
judges
dissenting
and
then
the
panel
denied
a
rehearing.
so,
the
sixth
circuit
has
expressed
itself
in
the
context
of
the
miller
case.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
not
protected,
it
has
no
dramatic
relevance
and
it's
not
expressive
conduct.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i've
never
seen
any
at
that
level.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
maybe
and
if
there
are--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
maybe
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
it's
beyond
me,
i
must
say
i
haven't
seen
it.
i
would
like
to
try
and
address
the
issue
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i'd
like
to
try
to
address
that
issue
which
i
think
is
--
which
is
at
the
core
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
questioning.
i
think
what
you
have
and
the
way
i
would
do
it
as
follows.
the
judge
found
that
the
play
was
obscene
because
he
was
able,
he
thought
to
separate
a
play
into
three
parts,
speech
by
which
he
meant
no
more
than
the
dialog,
symbolic
speech
which
he
said
was
speech
illustrative
of
the
dialog
and
conduct
and
now
there's
considerable
confusion
in
that
categorization,
but
if
i
understand
them
correctly,
all
the
nonverbal
aspects
of
the
play
are
conduct.
in
any
--
in
any
setup
of
this
trichotomy
and
then
he
began
to
hold
that
“hairs'”
conduct
was
obscene.
now,
to
put
it
differently,
the
judge
treats
a
play
as
though
were
little
more
than
a
combination
of
a
book
and
some
conduct.
the
book,
that
is
to
say
the
libretto
was
protected
speech
under
the
first
amendment,
but
the
conduct
is
not.
it's
wholly
outside
the
area
of
the
first
amendment.
this
permits
the
judge
to
view
the
conduct
in
isolation.
he
doesn't
have
to
address
himself
to
the
dramatic
relevance
of
the
conduct.
he
simply
says,
“this
conduct
whether
it
occurs
on
the
stage
or
whether
it
occurs
out
in
the
public
street
is
the
same
conduct.
we
concede
that
nudity
in
a
public
street
is
not
protected.”
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
the
evidentiary
point
we
take
the
position
that
the
conduct
itself
was
not
obscene
and
in
the
last
point
of
the
brief
we
argue
that
there's
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
do
i
think
you
can?
no,
i
think
you
can
make
a
determination
that
it's
not
obscene
without
seeing
the
play.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
none
of
the
judges
except
judge
mcrae.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
who
voted
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
do
not.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
is
not
hardcore
pornography,
i
think--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
think
that
the
basic
error
made
was
that
the
judge
simply
misunderstood
the
appropriate
criteria
and
it
led
him
into
all
sorts
of
errors.
he
equated
conduct
which
occurs
in
the
theater
with
--
and
has
dramatic
relevance
which
is
--
which
is
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
classic
form
of
expressive
conduct
as
a
play.
this
court
has
struggled
over
and
over
with
the
attempts
at
which
conduct
is
going
to
be
characterized
by
speech
and
then
brought
into
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
i
put
it
to
the
court
that
theater
is
the
classic
form
of
expressive
conduct
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes
it
can,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
if
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
criteria
set
down
in
the
miller
case.
the
point
that
we're
making
is
that
you
treat
the
play
as
a
unitary
production
first.
this
doesn't
mean
that
what
occurs
in
a
play
is
beyond
regulation.
a
sufficiently
compelling
governmental
interest
will
permit
regulation
of
the
conduct
aspects
of
a
play.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
don't
think
there's
a
great
deal.
i
mean
there's
no
reason
to
treat
them
as
though
they
were
totally
distinct,
but
where
the
governmental
interest
is
morality
and
the
state
regulation
focuses
on
either
nudity
or
simulated
sex,
it
seems
to
us
that
obscenity
criteria
must
be
satisfied.
now,
i
have
expected
to
--
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
i
would
be
forced
to
take
to
position
that
this
means
that
actual
sex
has
to
take
place
on
the
stage.
well,
fortunately
that's
not
this
case
and
i
don't
find
myself
the
best
advocate
for
it,
but
i
think
that
you
can't
take
--
make
principal
distinctions
between
actual
and
simulated
sex
and
all
this
case
apart
from
its
nudity
involved
is
a
simulated
sex.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
two
differences,
i'm
not
sure
that
they're
sound
in
the
end,
but
they
seem
to
me
to
be
--
to
be
very
significantly
different.
first,
there's
no
case
in
this
court
so
far
as
i
know
which
holds
that
nudity,
i
mean,
actual
sex
is
protected
expressive
conduct
under
the
first
amendment.
it
does
seem
to
me
too
late
in
the
day
to
take
the
position
that
no
simulated
sex
is
protected
and
once
you
--
and
at
least
the
line
becomes
clear
what
is
actual
sex
is
considerably
clearer
than
what
a
simulated
sex
and
once
the
concession
is
made
that
some
simulated
sex
is
protected,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
some
--
some
simulated
sex
maybe
put
down
if
it
gets
to
the
stage
are
being
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
it
does
not
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it
--
what
that
does
is
to
say
that
this
kind
of
material
can
be
denominated
patently
offensive
erotic
material,
but
you're
still
left
with
the
serious
redeeming
social
value
test.
the
miller
case
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that
test,
i
think,
is
alive
and
well.
it
specifically
retained
in
your
opinions
and
if
that
weren't
the
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
would
be
virtually
wiped
out
in
the
area
of
nonverbal
descriptions
of
sex
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
make
clear
the
serious
social
value
test.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
it's
serious
--
it
satisfies
all
those
requirements.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
no,
it's
not
utterly.
the
last
point
i
would
say
is
that
i
have
that
simulated
sex
is
necessarily
expressive
conduct.
it's
hard
to
see
that
actual
sex
really
is.
ordinarily,
the
simulation
will
take
care
of
everything
which
the
actual
sex
would
do.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
actual
nudity,
but
i
explained
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
response
i
would
make
is
twofold.
you've
accepted
essentially
the
argument
we've
made
with
respect
to
simulated
sex
and
with
respect
to
nudity,
the
only
standard
that
can
be
used
is
obscenity,
the
only
standard
that
can
be
used
--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i'm
saying
it
is
constitutionally
invalid
in
the
context
of
a
dramatic
performance
and
i
would
cite
to
your
honor
the
cases
that
are
cited
on
page
30
of
our
brief,
four
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
it's
never
been
understood.
some
line
has
to
be
drawn
and
some
line
derived
from
common
sense,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
has
to
be
applied
with
respect
to
the
point
at
which
you're
going
to
stop
labeling
conduct
speech.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
is
we
have
never
treated
expressive
conduct
--
we
have
never
treated
walking
around
nude.
there's
no
decision
from
this
court
which
would
suggest
the
conduct
like
that
is
understood
to
communicate
anything
whereas
in
a
play,
that's
quite
different,
it's
a
common
comprehensible
form
of
communication
in
a
context
of
a
dramatic
performance.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
in
a
different
--
there
different
state
interest,
yes.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
don't
know
that
anybody
understand
what
she
was
doing,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.[attempt
