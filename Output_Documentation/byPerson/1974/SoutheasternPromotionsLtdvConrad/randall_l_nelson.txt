mr.
randall
l.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brother
started
off
by
saying
that
the
city
of
chattanooga
has
asserted
essentially
an
unlimited
right
of
censorship.
we
would
say
that
this
is
simply
not
true
in
this
case.
the
standard
form
lease
which
the
petitioner
sought
in
the
action
specifically
contains
a
clause
which
says
that
all
lessees
must
agree
to
abide
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
the
united
states
and
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chattanooga.
one
of
those
ordinances
as
has
been
pointed
out,
specifically
prohibits
public
nudity,
it
prohibits
obscene
acts.
on
top
of
that,
there
is
the
tennessee
common
law
criminal
violation
of
indecent
exposure
or
gross
lewdness,
all
of
which
are
violated.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
sir.
what
happened
before
the
action
was
actually
brought
was
never
brought
into
the
record
in
this
case,
but
there
has
never
at
any
time
been
any
question
about
what
this
nudity
would
take
place.
in
fact,
i
believe
it
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
he
was
denied
--
his
application
was
denied
at
the
time
that
it
was
made,
because
it's
public
knowledge
that
nudity
would
take
place
which
was
never
denied
by
the
petitioner,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
your
honor,
it
was
stipulated
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
now--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
it
was
stipulated
that
when
--
that
the
same
conduct
would
occur
in
this
play
as
has
occurred
in
all
the
other
plays.
it
was
not
denied
by
the
petitioner
at
any
time
that
this
public
nudity
took
place.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
sir,
but
it
would,
they
had
agreed
with
that.
all
down
to
the
line,
this
was
never
an
issue
between
the
parties.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
then
--
then
we
get
into,
as
you
say,
a
different
kind
of
action.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
been
their
position
all
along.
even
in
the
preliminary
hearing
which
was
held
two
days
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
it
was
admitted
by
the
petitioner
before
the
desired
dates
that
public
nudity
would
occur
on
the
stage.
this
has
never
been
an
issue
between
the
parties.
now,
at
any
rate
as
i
say
the
lease
form
does
set
forth
the
criteria
which
the
auditorium
board
uses
whether
or
not
any
ordinances
or
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee
are
violated.
as
the
judge
found,
the
play
opens
and
i
would
beg
the
pardon
of
the
court
to
use
some
of
the
languages
to
what
happened
in
the
play
with
one
of
the
main
characters
coming
out
on
stage,
throwing
his
trousers
to
the
audience
and
leaping
down
into
the
audience
and
going
down
and
straddling
a
seat
among
the
front
rows,
in
front
of
a
female
patron
and
looking
down
at
her
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
“i'll
bet
you're
scared,
shitless!”
now,
this
is
the
type
we
do
get
some
audience
participation,
as
your
honors
have
found,
or
as
the
courts
below
have
found.
further,
there
was
a
question
over
“hair”
about
the
conduct
in
miller.
whether
or
not
the
conduct
in
“hair”
would
violate
the
standards
of
miller,
the
trial
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor,
that
is
--
that
is
not
our
view.
our
view
is
that
the
standards
in
miller
as
well
as
other
as
the
obscenity
law
were
violated
in
other
portions
of
the
play,
but
there
was
a
question
about
audience
interaction
and
i
was
directing
it
to
that.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
now,
the
court
in
it's
finding
of
the
facts,
found
on
page
41
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
specifically
found
that
the
overwhelming
evidence
reflects
that
simulated
acts
of
anal
intercourse,
frontal
intercourse,
heterosexual
intercourse,
homosexual
intercourse
and
group
intercourse
are
committed
throughout
the
play.
often
without
any
reference
to
any
dialog,
song
or
storyline
in
the
play.
at
one
point
the
character
burger
performs
a
full
and
complete
simulation
of
masturbation
by
using
a
red
microphone
placed
in
his
crotch
to
simulate
his
genitals.
now,
this
falls
directly
within
the
language
of
the
miller
case.
my
brother
has
taken
the
position
that
obscenity
must
be
tolerated
if
it
is
a
part
of
the
same
vehicle
whereby
first
amendment
rights
are
allegedly
being
exercised.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
position
fails
to
recognize
that
obscenity
can
manifest
itself
in
conduct
as
well
as
in
the
pictorial
representation
of
conduct
or
in
a
written
and
oral
description
of
conduct.
the
district
court
herein
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
recognized
this
difference
and
applied
it.
subsequently
to
the
district
court
judge's
finding
in
this
case
and
ruling,
this
court
in
kaplan
versus
california
also
distinguished
between
the
different
forms
of
obscenity,
i.e.,
that
they
could
occur
in
conduct.
now,
this
--
i
think
we
all
must
recognize
the
theatrical
differs
from
other
medium
of
entertainment.
from
movies,
from
books,
it's
differentiated
by
the
fact
that
live
conduct
does
occur
on
the
stage.
this
is
the
whole
difference
in
the
theatrical
and
other
forms
of
entertainment.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that
is
true
and
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
--
but
i
think
the
difference
here
is
when
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
crime,
we
know
that
a
murder
when
simulated
on
stage
accomplishes
no
evil,
but
when
an
obscene
act
occurs
on
stage
that
act
does
accomplish
the
evil
at
which
prohibition
is
aimed.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
would
go
to
the
concurring
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
your
honor,
but
i
would
refer,
your
honor
to
the
opinion
--
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
original
roth
case,
wherein
he
says
that
the
state
has
a
very
real
interest
in
preventing
repeated
acts
of
sexual
obscenity
from
occurring
and
that
over
a
period
of
time
this
can
erode
the
moral
fabric
of
the
society.
and
of
course,
if
this
is
permitted
to
go
forward
then
this
would
be
just
one
more
erosion
and
it's
the
simulated
act
itself
which
is
causing
this
erosion
because
it's
a
sexual
act
in
and
off
itself.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
if
we
had
a
simulated,
a
fully
simulated
act
of
adultery
on
the
stage
that
it
would
embody
the
same
sexual
conduct
that
we're
talking
about
and
it
should
be
forbidden,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
it
would
--
no,
your
honor
because
the
murder
is
not
actually
accomplished.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
a
sexual
act
is
not
accomplished,
but
a
--
in
the
terms
of
--
as
judge
wilson
put
it
as
the
pregnancy
being
consummated
or
something
in
that
nature,
but
a
sexual
act
is
actually
done
on
stage
where
two
actors
or
actresses
embrace
each
other
in
a
copulation
position
making
all
of
the
thrusting
movements
that
are
generally
associated
there
with,
that
is
a
sexual
act.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
it
did
and
our
new
tennessee
statute
which
has
been
enacted
and
appended
to
our
brief
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct.
i
think
we
can
look
at
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reason
to
remand
because
the
same
acts
which
miller
later
came
along
and
defined
were
found
by
the
district
judge
in
this
case
and
there
would
be
no
prejudice
whatsoever
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that
would
be
a
secondary
position.
first
of
all
we
would
take
the
position
that
because
this
conduct
did
occur,
the
public
nudity
and
so
forth
and
it
is
directed
at
conduct
and
not
a
miller
obscenity
standards
or
any
other
obscenity
standards
relating
to
first
amendment
freedoms
that
the
case
shouldn't
be
remanded
at
all
or
shouldn't
even
be
considered.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
that
a
municipality,
particularly
where
they've
done
this
by
regulation,
has
the
duty
to
set
an
example
for
its
constituents.
and
certainly
if
we
permit
obscene
acts
to
go
forward
on
public
property,
it
tends
to
degrade
these
standards
that
the
municipality
might
apply
to
other
institutions.
now,
i
think
also
that
there
maybe
a
difference
where
a
municipality
comes
forward
and
actually
arrests
somebody
or
confiscates
some
materials,
here
they
have
--
we've
not
done
anything
of
that
nature.
we've
simply
refused
to
enter
into
what
we
consider
an
illegal
contract,
which
my
brother
has
already
said,
maybe
if
your
honors
find
that
the
play
was
obscene,
would
be
an
illegal
contract.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
there
--
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
one
of
the
questions
which
i
addressed
to
commissioner
conrad
who
is
the
commissioner
of
public
utilities,
grounds
and
buildings
within
the
city
was
directed
specifically
at
that
and
there
he
testified
that
there
were
several
other
places
where
this
could
have
played
on
the
private
market.
also
the
university
of
tennessee
at
chattanooga
maintains
an
auditorium
or
gymnasium
where
the
play
could
have
gone
forward.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your,
honor
but
there
were
private
institutions,
which
could
have
been
rented.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor,
we
have
no
licensing
whatsoever.
we
have
no
censorship
board
within
the
city.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
although
i
cannot
cite
you
to
supreme
court
decision
or
to
anything
of
that
nature,
but
it
would
be
in
my
understanding
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
it
is
open
to
the
general
public,
it
is
not
a
private
type
of
club.
now,
judge
wilson
in
his
original
decision
did
not
find
that
the
play
as
a
whole
was
obscene.
this
was
simply
because
and
he
emphasized
in
his
opinion
because
he
did
not
find
the
play
to
be
quote
“utterly
without
redeeming
social
value”
in
the
text.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
excuse
me?
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
see
the
play.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
through
the
--
the
method
by
which
the
case
was
brought
before
the
court
was
that
the
libretto
was
introduced,
witnesses
were
introduced
to,
who
read
the
libretto,
described
the
action
which
occurred
during
the
various
scenes
of
the
libretto.
i
think
there
were
a
total
of
eight
different
witnesses,
some
six
of
whom
had
seen
the
play
and
every
witness
who
had
seen
the
play
testified
that
the
acts
which
judge
wilson
found
in
his
opinion
and
which
i
have
alleged
took
place
did
actually
take
place.
there's
no
question,
but
that
those
acts
did
take
place.
also
i
think
particularly
with
respect
to
the
public
nudity,
judge
wilson
found
that
many
of
these
acts
occurred
outside
of
the
theme
or
play
line
of
the
play.
for
instance,
the
act
involved
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
some
cases
the
playwright
might
know
what
he
means
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
but
in
this
case
the
playwright
didn't
even
write
the
nude
scene
in.
it
is
not
in
the
libretto,
it
is
not
in
the
script
and
yet
it
occurs
time
after
time
after
time.
that
is
the
point
that
they
attempted
to
commercialize
the
nudity
in
order
to
attract
the
people
to
see
it
and
it
is
this
commercialized
obscenity
which
gives
the
state
one
of
its
primary
reasons
to
enforce
the
public
morality
in
this
case.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
believe
it's
on
mr.
monaghan's
brief
where
he
was
attempting
to
categorize
it,
your
honor.
now,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
o'brien
case
which
your
honors
have
decided
is
in
point
in
this
case.
to
our
knowledge,
it
has
never
been
asserted
that
first
amendment
freedoms
permit
nudity
in
public
places
and
other
phases
of
sexual
misconduct
much
less
require
that
the
responsible
public
officials
be
mandated
to
allow
them
in
the
public's
auditorium.
in
o'brien,
if
your
honors
will
recall
a
draft
--
a
felon
burned
his
draft
card
alleging
that
this
was
freedom
of
speech
and
this
court
annunciated
a
four-part
test
which
judge
wilson
found
applied
to
this
particular
play.
he
found
that
the
state
and
local
governments
do
have
an
interest
under
their
respective
police
powers
to
make
regulations
concerning
the
public
morals.
he
held
as
this
court
later
in
the
paris
adult
theater
case
that
there
is
a
long
recognized
legitimate
state
interest
involved,
i.e.
stemming
the
tide
of
commercialized
obscenity.
he
further
held
that
the
city
ordinance
on
public
nudity
and
obscene
acts
and
the
tennessee
common
law
on
indecent
exposure
are
not
regulations
governing
communication
and
are
unrelated
to
the
freedom
of
expression.
and
he
further
found
that
the
incidental
restriction
was
no
greater
than
what
was
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
the
state's
interest.
in
this
regard,
i
would
point
out
that
the
city
had
no
other
means
available
to
keep
illicit
conduct
from
occurring
on
stage.
now,
my
brother
has
taken
the
position
that
before
a
law
involving
the
public
morals
can
be
relied
upon,
it
must
meet
obscenity
standards.
we
would
respectfully
dissent
from
this
view.
this
is
because
such
laws
as
laws
directed
at
morals
are
not
directed
at
speech
activities.
now,
they
are
therefore
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
first
amendment
out
of
which
all
of
the
standards
for
obscenity
have
emanated.
thus,
there
can
be
no
obscenity
requirement.
the
first
amendment
simply
provides
that
congress
and
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
municipalities
and
the
states
shall
make
no
laws
abridging
freedom
of
speech.
now,
the
law
governing
public
nudity
is
not
a
law
governing
freedom
of
speech.
pubic
nudity
is
not
speech.
it
is
conduct
and
subject
to
the
police
power
of
the
states.
my
brother
has
suggested
that
we
must
draw
a
line
somewhere
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
line
be
drawn
when
you
cross
the
line
from
speech
to
conduct
as
we
have
here
done
rather
than
breaking
it
off
and
this
type
of
conduct
is
good
and
this
type
of
conduct
is
bad.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
they
may
enact
laws
against
public
nudity
which
we
have
and
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
we
can
go
in
without
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
it's
been
specifically
found
in
jenkins
versus
georgia
that
it's
not.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
definitely.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that
as
we
have
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
--
i
mean
yes
it
is,
excuse
me--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
--
because
as
we
move
--
because
as
we
move
from
the
screen
to
the
stage,
we
move
from
the
depiction
of
conduct
to
the
actual
conduct
itself.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
didn't
say
it
that
it
is
obscene.
i
said
that
it
is
a
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
the
state
can
prohibit
it.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
because
it
is
public
nudity
and
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
just
as
you
can
regulate
a
rape
or
something
like
this
(voice
overlap)
on
stage.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
as
we
move
from
the
stage
to
the
screen
that
the
powers
of
the
state
are
correspondingly
increased,
because
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
the
state
law
in
tennessee
now
does
read
actual
or
simulation.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
how
do
you
simulate
nudity?
when
we're
speaking
specifically
in
terms
of
nudity,
it's
sort
of
like
being
pregnant,
it's
either
you
are
or
you
aren't.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes
your
honor,
i
would
refer
to
the
case
of
riyal
versus
state
of
tennessee
in
our
brief.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
the
city
ordinance,
i
think
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
the
city
ordinance
uses
--
obscene
indecent
or
lewd
act
in
a
public
place.
now
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor,
particularly
when
you're
dealing
with
the
screen,
i
think
that
lewdness
has
a
broader
category
than
would
be
nudity.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
you
normally
don't
find
a
person
on
display
in
a
museum.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
lewdness
is
much
broader
category.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
the
case
of
riyal
versus
the
state
of
tennessee
mentioned
in
our
brief.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
which
i
didn't
go
into
facts
in
that
case,
but
the
case
involved
a
situation
where
a
man
called
a
woman
on
the
street
and
found
her
turning
and
looking
he
exposed
himself
without
--
just
standing
there
and
without
making
any
indecent
expressions
to
her,
much
has
occurred
on
the
stage
in
this
play
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
that
case
said
that
upon
exposure
of
one's
genitals,
all
that
is
necessary
is
the
intent
to
expose,
not
the
intent
to
do
so
for
an
immoral
purpose
and
they
affirmed
the
conviction
of
the
man
based
on
gross
indecency
and
lewdness.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes
sir.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
this
is
a
common
law
offense
that
i'm
speaking
of
right
now.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor.
because
once
again
our
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
it
might
be
now
under
the
post-miller
decision.
i
don't
really
know
how
far
that
will
go
as
it
applies
to
the
movies
as
opposed
to
stage
plays,
but
here
we
have
across
the
line
from
literature
and
movies
and
so
forth
into
actual
conduct
which
i
believe
your
honor
referred
to
in
your
dissent
in
the
roth
case.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
would
believe
so,
your
honor,
although
once
again
i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
definitive
decision
on
that,
but
coming
down
and
off
the
stage
and
wearing
only
briefs
with
some
beads
hanging
down
in
front
of
him
as
this
man
did
and
standing
or
sitting
himself
on
a
seat
facing
a
young
lady
and
saying
“i
bet
your
scared
shitless!”
and
then
proceeding
back
towards
the
stage
using
these
beads
to
simulate
his
genitals
and
going
through
what
would
amount
to
a
masturbation,
i
think
that
under
the
post-miller
law
that
has
been
adopted,
that
that
could
constitute
lewdness
under
tennessee
law.
in
conclusion
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
it
would
be
a
simulated
masturbation
which
would
be
clearly
subject
to
prosecution
as
indecent
or
obscene
acts.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
the
case
has
never
been
decided,
but
it
would
be
my
opinion.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
would
think
it
would
be
as
he
was
saying
come
down
off
the
stage
and
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
you
can
but
going
up
and
confronting
a
young
lady
out
in
the
public
and
spreading
your
legs
and
wearing
only
a
brief
pair
of
shorts
and
looking
down
at
her
and
saying
“i
think
--
i'll
bet
you're
scared
shitless!”
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
that
would
constitute
lewd
act,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
a
lead
act
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
a
lewd
act,
an
act
of
gross
indecency.
disrobing
at
least
partially,
so
all
the
way
down
to
jockey
shorts
or
whatever
you
call
them
and
confronting
a
young
lady
in
such
a
situation.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brother
started
off
by
saying
that
the
city
of
chattanooga
has
asserted
essentially
an
unlimited
right
of
censorship.
we
would
say
that
this
is
simply
not
true
in
this
case.
the
standard
form
lease
which
the
petitioner
sought
in
the
action
specifically
contains
a
clause
which
says
that
all
lessees
must
agree
to
abide
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
the
united
states
and
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chattanooga.
one
of
those
ordinances
as
has
been
pointed
out,
specifically
prohibits
public
nudity,
it
prohibits
obscene
acts.
on
top
of
that,
there
is
the
tennessee
common
law
criminal
violation
of
indecent
exposure
or
gross
lewdness,
all
of
which
are
violated.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
sir.
what
happened
before
the
action
was
actually
brought
was
never
brought
into
the
record
in
this
case,
but
there
has
never
at
any
time
been
any
question
about
what
this
nudity
would
take
place.
in
fact,
i
believe
it
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
he
was
denied
--
his
application
was
denied
at
the
time
that
it
was
made,
because
it's
public
knowledge
that
nudity
would
take
place
which
was
never
denied
by
the
petitioner,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
your
honor,
it
was
stipulated
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
now--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
it
was
stipulated
that
when
--
that
the
same
conduct
would
occur
in
this
play
as
has
occurred
in
all
the
other
plays.
it
was
not
denied
by
the
petitioner
at
any
time
that
this
public
nudity
took
place.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
sir,
but
it
would,
they
had
agreed
with
that.
all
down
to
the
line,
this
was
never
an
issue
between
the
parties.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
then
--
then
we
get
into,
as
you
say,
a
different
kind
of
action.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
been
their
position
all
along.
even
in
the
preliminary
hearing
which
was
held
two
days
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
it
was
admitted
by
the
petitioner
before
the
desired
dates
that
public
nudity
would
occur
on
the
stage.
this
has
never
been
an
issue
between
the
parties.
now,
at
any
rate
as
i
say
the
lease
form
does
set
forth
the
criteria
which
the
auditorium
board
uses
whether
or
not
any
ordinances
or
laws
of
the
state
of
tennessee
are
violated.
as
the
judge
found,
the
play
opens
and
i
would
beg
the
pardon
of
the
court
to
use
some
of
the
languages
to
what
happened
in
the
play
with
one
of
the
main
characters
coming
out
on
stage,
throwing
his
trousers
to
the
audience
and
leaping
down
into
the
audience
and
going
down
and
straddling
a
seat
among
the
front
rows,
in
front
of
a
female
patron
and
looking
down
at
her
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
“i'll
bet
you're
scared,
shitless!”
now,
this
is
the
type
we
do
get
some
audience
participation,
as
your
honors
have
found,
or
as
the
courts
below
have
found.
further,
there
was
a
question
over
“hair”
about
the
conduct
in
miller.
whether
or
not
the
conduct
in
“hair”
would
violate
the
standards
of
miller,
the
trial
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor,
that
is
--
that
is
not
our
view.
our
view
is
that
the
standards
in
miller
as
well
as
other
as
the
obscenity
law
were
violated
in
other
portions
of
the
play,
but
there
was
a
question
about
audience
interaction
and
i
was
directing
it
to
that.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
now,
the
court
in
it's
finding
of
the
facts,
found
on
page
41
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
specifically
found
that
the
overwhelming
evidence
reflects
that
simulated
acts
of
anal
intercourse,
frontal
intercourse,
heterosexual
intercourse,
homosexual
intercourse
and
group
intercourse
are
committed
throughout
the
play.
often
without
any
reference
to
any
dialog,
song
or
storyline
in
the
play.
at
one
point
the
character
burger
performs
a
full
and
complete
simulation
of
masturbation
by
using
a
red
microphone
placed
in
his
crotch
to
simulate
his
genitals.
now,
this
falls
directly
within
the
language
of
the
miller
case.
my
brother
has
taken
the
position
that
obscenity
must
be
tolerated
if
it
is
a
part
of
the
same
vehicle
whereby
first
amendment
rights
are
allegedly
being
exercised.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
position
fails
to
recognize
that
obscenity
can
manifest
itself
in
conduct
as
well
as
in
the
pictorial
representation
of
conduct
or
in
a
written
and
oral
description
of
conduct.
the
district
court
herein
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
recognized
this
difference
and
applied
it.
subsequently
to
the
district
court
judge's
finding
in
this
case
and
ruling,
this
court
in
kaplan
versus
california
also
distinguished
between
the
different
forms
of
obscenity,
i.e.,
that
they
could
occur
in
conduct.
now,
this
--
i
think
we
all
must
recognize
the
theatrical
differs
from
other
medium
of
entertainment.
from
movies,
from
books,
it's
differentiated
by
the
fact
that
live
conduct
does
occur
on
the
stage.
this
is
the
whole
difference
in
the
theatrical
and
other
forms
of
entertainment.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that
is
true
and
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
--
but
i
think
the
difference
here
is
when
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
crime,
we
know
that
a
murder
when
simulated
on
stage
accomplishes
no
evil,
but
when
an
obscene
act
occurs
on
stage
that
act
does
accomplish
the
evil
at
which
prohibition
is
aimed.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
would
go
to
the
concurring
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
your
honor,
but
i
would
refer,
your
honor
to
the
opinion
--
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
original
roth
case,
wherein
he
says
that
the
state
has
a
very
real
interest
in
preventing
repeated
acts
of
sexual
obscenity
from
occurring
and
that
over
a
period
of
time
this
can
erode
the
moral
fabric
of
the
society.
and
of
course,
if
this
is
permitted
to
go
forward
then
this
would
be
just
one
more
erosion
and
it's
the
simulated
act
itself
which
is
causing
this
erosion
because
it's
a
sexual
act
in
and
off
itself.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
if
we
had
a
simulated,
a
fully
simulated
act
of
adultery
on
the
stage
that
it
would
embody
the
same
sexual
conduct
that
we're
talking
about
and
it
should
be
forbidden,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
it
would
--
no,
your
honor
because
the
murder
is
not
actually
accomplished.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
a
sexual
act
is
not
accomplished,
but
a
--
in
the
terms
of
--
as
judge
wilson
put
it
as
the
pregnancy
being
consummated
or
something
in
that
nature,
but
a
sexual
act
is
actually
done
on
stage
where
two
actors
or
actresses
embrace
each
other
in
a
copulation
position
making
all
of
the
thrusting
movements
that
are
generally
associated
there
with,
that
is
a
sexual
act.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
it
did
and
our
new
tennessee
statute
which
has
been
enacted
and
appended
to
our
brief
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct.
i
think
we
can
look
at
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reason
to
remand
because
the
same
acts
which
miller
later
came
along
and
defined
were
found
by
the
district
judge
in
this
case
and
there
would
be
no
prejudice
whatsoever
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that
would
be
a
secondary
position.
first
of
all
we
would
take
the
position
that
because
this
conduct
did
occur,
the
public
nudity
and
so
forth
and
it
is
directed
at
conduct
and
not
a
miller
obscenity
standards
or
any
other
obscenity
standards
relating
to
first
amendment
freedoms
that
the
case
shouldn't
be
remanded
at
all
or
shouldn't
even
be
considered.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
that
a
municipality,
particularly
where
they've
done
this
by
regulation,
has
the
duty
to
set
an
example
for
its
constituents.
and
certainly
if
we
permit
obscene
acts
to
go
forward
on
public
property,
it
tends
to
degrade
these
standards
that
the
municipality
might
apply
to
other
institutions.
now,
i
think
also
that
there
maybe
a
difference
where
a
municipality
comes
forward
and
actually
arrests
somebody
or
confiscates
some
materials,
here
they
have
--
we've
not
done
anything
of
that
nature.
we've
simply
refused
to
enter
into
what
we
consider
an
illegal
contract,
which
my
brother
has
already
said,
maybe
if
your
honors
find
that
the
play
was
obscene,
would
be
an
illegal
contract.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
there
--
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
one
of
the
questions
which
i
addressed
to
commissioner
conrad
who
is
the
commissioner
of
public
utilities,
grounds
and
buildings
within
the
city
was
directed
specifically
at
that
and
there
he
testified
that
there
were
several
other
places
where
this
could
have
played
on
the
private
market.
also
the
university
of
tennessee
at
chattanooga
maintains
an
auditorium
or
gymnasium
where
the
play
could
have
gone
forward.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your,
honor
but
there
were
private
institutions,
which
could
have
been
rented.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor,
we
have
no
licensing
whatsoever.
we
have
no
censorship
board
within
the
city.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
although
i
cannot
cite
you
to
supreme
court
decision
or
to
anything
of
that
nature,
but
it
would
be
in
my
understanding
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
it
is
open
to
the
general
public,
it
is
not
a
private
type
of
club.
now,
judge
wilson
in
his
original
decision
did
not
find
that
the
play
as
a
whole
was
obscene.
this
was
simply
because
and
he
emphasized
in
his
opinion
because
he
did
not
find
the
play
to
be
quote
“utterly
without
redeeming
social
value”
in
the
text.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
excuse
me?
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
see
the
play.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
through
the
--
the
method
by
which
the
case
was
brought
before
the
court
was
that
the
libretto
was
introduced,
witnesses
were
introduced
to,
who
read
the
libretto,
described
the
action
which
occurred
during
the
various
scenes
of
the
libretto.
i
think
there
were
a
total
of
eight
different
witnesses,
some
six
of
whom
had
seen
the
play
and
every
witness
who
had
seen
the
play
testified
that
the
acts
which
judge
wilson
found
in
his
opinion
and
which
i
have
alleged
took
place
did
actually
take
place.
there's
no
question,
but
that
those
acts
did
take
place.
also
i
think
particularly
with
respect
to
the
public
nudity,
judge
wilson
found
that
many
of
these
acts
occurred
outside
of
the
theme
or
play
line
of
the
play.
for
instance,
the
act
involved
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
some
cases
the
playwright
might
know
what
he
means
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
but
in
this
case
the
playwright
didn't
even
write
the
nude
scene
in.
it
is
not
in
the
libretto,
it
is
not
in
the
script
and
yet
it
occurs
time
after
time
after
time.
that
is
the
point
that
they
attempted
to
commercialize
the
nudity
in
order
to
attract
the
people
to
see
it
and
it
is
this
commercialized
obscenity
which
gives
the
state
one
of
its
primary
reasons
to
enforce
the
public
morality
in
this
case.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
believe
it's
on
mr.
monaghan's
brief
where
he
was
attempting
to
categorize
it,
your
honor.
now,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
o'brien
case
which
your
honors
have
decided
is
in
point
in
this
case.
to
our
knowledge,
it
has
never
been
asserted
that
first
amendment
freedoms
permit
nudity
in
public
places
and
other
phases
of
sexual
misconduct
much
less
require
that
the
responsible
public
officials
be
mandated
to
allow
them
in
the
public's
auditorium.
in
o'brien,
if
your
honors
will
recall
a
draft
--
a
felon
burned
his
draft
card
alleging
that
this
was
freedom
of
speech
and
this
court
annunciated
a
four-part
test
which
judge
wilson
found
applied
to
this
particular
play.
he
found
that
the
state
and
local
governments
do
have
an
interest
under
their
respective
police
powers
to
make
regulations
concerning
the
public
morals.
he
held
as
this
court
later
in
the
paris
adult
theater
case
that
there
is
a
long
recognized
legitimate
state
interest
involved,
i.e.
stemming
the
tide
of
commercialized
obscenity.
he
further
held
that
the
city
ordinance
on
public
nudity
and
obscene
acts
and
the
tennessee
common
law
on
indecent
exposure
are
not
regulations
governing
communication
and
are
unrelated
to
the
freedom
of
expression.
and
he
further
found
that
the
incidental
restriction
was
no
greater
than
what
was
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
the
state's
interest.
in
this
regard,
i
would
point
out
that
the
city
had
no
other
means
available
to
keep
illicit
conduct
from
occurring
on
stage.
now,
my
brother
has
taken
the
position
that
before
a
law
involving
the
public
morals
can
be
relied
upon,
it
must
meet
obscenity
standards.
we
would
respectfully
dissent
from
this
view.
this
is
because
such
laws
as
laws
directed
at
morals
are
not
directed
at
speech
activities.
now,
they
are
therefore
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
first
amendment
out
of
which
all
of
the
standards
for
obscenity
have
emanated.
thus,
there
can
be
no
obscenity
requirement.
the
first
amendment
simply
provides
that
congress
and
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
municipalities
and
the
states
shall
make
no
laws
abridging
freedom
of
speech.
now,
the
law
governing
public
nudity
is
not
a
law
governing
freedom
of
speech.
pubic
nudity
is
not
speech.
it
is
conduct
and
subject
to
the
police
power
of
the
states.
my
brother
has
suggested
that
we
must
draw
a
line
somewhere
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
line
be
drawn
when
you
cross
the
line
from
speech
to
conduct
as
we
have
here
done
rather
than
breaking
it
off
and
this
type
of
conduct
is
good
and
this
type
of
conduct
is
bad.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
they
may
enact
laws
against
public
nudity
which
we
have
and
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
we
can
go
in
without
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
it's
been
specifically
found
in
jenkins
versus
georgia
that
it's
not.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
your
honor,
definitely.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that
as
we
have
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
--
i
mean
yes
it
is,
excuse
me--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
--
because
as
we
move
--
because
as
we
move
from
the
screen
to
the
stage,
we
move
from
the
depiction
of
conduct
to
the
actual
conduct
itself.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
didn't
say
it
that
it
is
obscene.
i
said
that
it
is
a
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
the
state
can
prohibit
it.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
because
it
is
public
nudity
and
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
just
as
you
can
regulate
a
rape
or
something
like
this
(voice
overlap)
on
stage.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
as
we
move
from
the
stage
to
the
screen
that
the
powers
of
the
state
are
correspondingly
increased,
because
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
the
state
law
in
tennessee
now
does
read
actual
or
simulation.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
how
do
you
simulate
nudity?
when
we're
speaking
specifically
in
terms
of
nudity,
it's
sort
of
like
being
pregnant,
it's
either
you
are
or
you
aren't.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes
your
honor,
i
would
refer
to
the
case
of
riyal
versus
state
of
tennessee
in
our
brief.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
that's
the
city
ordinance,
i
think
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
the
city
ordinance
uses
--
obscene
indecent
or
lewd
act
in
a
public
place.
now
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor,
particularly
when
you're
dealing
with
the
screen,
i
think
that
lewdness
has
a
broader
category
than
would
be
nudity.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
you
normally
don't
find
a
person
on
display
in
a
museum.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
lewdness
is
much
broader
category.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
the
case
of
riyal
versus
the
state
of
tennessee
mentioned
in
our
brief.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
which
i
didn't
go
into
facts
in
that
case,
but
the
case
involved
a
situation
where
a
man
called
a
woman
on
the
street
and
found
her
turning
and
looking
he
exposed
himself
without
--
just
standing
there
and
without
making
any
indecent
expressions
to
her,
much
has
occurred
on
the
stage
in
this
play
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
that
case
said
that
upon
exposure
of
one's
genitals,
all
that
is
necessary
is
the
intent
to
expose,
not
the
intent
to
do
so
for
an
immoral
purpose
and
they
affirmed
the
conviction
of
the
man
based
on
gross
indecency
and
lewdness.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes
sir.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
this
is
a
common
law
offense
that
i'm
speaking
of
right
now.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
no
your
honor.
because
once
again
our
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
well,
it
might
be
now
under
the
post-miller
decision.
i
don't
really
know
how
far
that
will
go
as
it
applies
to
the
movies
as
opposed
to
stage
plays,
but
here
we
have
across
the
line
from
literature
and
movies
and
so
forth
into
actual
conduct
which
i
believe
your
honor
referred
to
in
your
dissent
in
the
roth
case.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
would
believe
so,
your
honor,
although
once
again
i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
definitive
decision
on
that,
but
coming
down
and
off
the
stage
and
wearing
only
briefs
with
some
beads
hanging
down
in
front
of
him
as
this
man
did
and
standing
or
sitting
himself
on
a
seat
facing
a
young
lady
and
saying
“i
bet
your
scared
shitless!”
and
then
proceeding
back
towards
the
stage
using
these
beads
to
simulate
his
genitals
and
going
through
what
would
amount
to
a
masturbation,
i
think
that
under
the
post-miller
law
that
has
been
adopted,
that
that
could
constitute
lewdness
under
tennessee
law.
in
conclusion
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
it
would
be
a
simulated
masturbation
which
would
be
clearly
subject
to
prosecution
as
indecent
or
obscene
acts.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
the
case
has
never
been
decided,
but
it
would
be
my
opinion.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
would
think
it
would
be
as
he
was
saying
come
down
off
the
stage
and
--
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
yes,
you
can
but
going
up
and
confronting
a
young
lady
out
in
the
public
and
spreading
your
legs
and
wearing
only
a
brief
pair
of
shorts
and
looking
down
at
her
and
saying
“i
think
--
i'll
bet
you're
scared
shitless!”
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
i
think
that
would
constitute
lewd
act,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
a
lead
act
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
nelson
a
lewd
act,
an
act
of
gross
indecency.
disrobing
at
least
partially,
so
all
the
way
down
to
jockey
shorts
or
whatever
you
call
them
and
confronting
a
young
lady
in
such
a
situation.
