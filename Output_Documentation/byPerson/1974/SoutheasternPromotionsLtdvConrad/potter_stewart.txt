justice
potter
stewart
but
wasn't
the
reasoning
--
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
judge
--
it
was
frank
wilson
one
of
the
district
judge
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
play
of
othello
and
othello
actually
did
strangled
desdemona
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
killed
her?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
concept
is
different
from
an
obscenity
concept,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
--
do
you
mr.
--
the
question
attack
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
criminal
law
or
the
chattanooga
city
code,
section
25-28
which
makes
it
criminal
for
any
person
in
the
city
to
appear
in
a
public
place
in
a
state
of
nudity?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
public
place
--
in
a
public
place?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
--
what
if
--
one
of
the
actors
stole
money
from
the
other
--
from
another
actor
on
the
stage.
would
the
larceny
statute
be
unconstitutional
was
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
actually
stole
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
would
a
person's
choice
to
walk
around
without
any
clothes
on
also
the
first
amendment
right,
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
just
like
it
--
the
kind
of
clothes,
the
kind
of
necktie
a
person
might
wear
if
he
were
--
if
he
chose
to
wear
clothes.
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
his
hair
long
or
short,
why
isn't
that
protected
by
the
first
amendment
under
your
view
on
the
public
streets?
justice
potter
stewart
hair
styles
have
been
treated
by
many
courts
to
be
expressive
conduct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it's
been
treated
many,
many
times
repeatedly
in
many
lawsuits.
justice
potter
stewart
hell's
a'
poppin'
justice
potter
stewart
hell's
a'
poppin',
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
correctly
say,
the
theater
is
one
of
the
very
first
forms
of
expression,
but
the
common
quality
of
the
plays
and/or
the
moving
pictures
is
basically
that
it
is
all
simulated,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
when
othello
strangles
desdemona,
you
don't
actually,
that
isn't
a
murder,
in
fact
that's
a
simulated
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
--that's
the
characteristic
of
plays
and
the
movies,
but
this
was
not
simulated
nudity.
this
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
actual
nudity,
and
did
run
afoul
you
say
it
perhaps
didn't
because
the
theater
wasn't
a
public
place
by
putting
that
to
one
side
and
assuming
the
theater
--
this
theater
was
a
public
place,
it
directly
violated
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chattanooga,
not
having
to
do
with
obscenity
as
such,
but
having
to
do
with
indecent
exposure
as
it's
called.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
--
well,
then
are
you
saying
that
this
ordinance
is
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
petitioner
refuse
to
sign
this
contract?
did
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
if
he
--
not
if
he
signed
the
contract
i
suppose,
you
never
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
do
it,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
show
never
took
place
in
this
auditorium?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don't
know,
but
you
never
gave
him
an
opportunity.
you
just
assumed
in
advance
that
he
would
break
his
promise,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
later
lawsuit,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
stipulated
that
had
he
signed
this
agreement,
he
would
not
have
--
he
would
have
violated
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
it
take
place
in
chattanooga?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
never
--
so,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
rely
on
this
contractual
language
when
you
never
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
sign
the
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
had
he
signed
it
and
then
violated
the
contract,
you
would
have
maybe
a
different
kind
of
an
action
or
conflict?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
view
that
the
--
that
line
--
that
opening
line
of
the
play
that
you
just
quoted
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
violates
any
statute
or
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
it's
generally
--
it's
generally
simulated
conduct.
in
other
words
the
--
it
is
human
beings
move,
walking
around
and
speaking
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
the
conduct
is
generally
simulated
conduct.
the
murders
are
not
real
murders;
the
larcenies
are
not
real
larcenies,
that's
the
whole
--
that's
the
whole
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
quality
of
drama?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
--
now,
why
is
a
simulated
act
of
that
kind
any
worse
than
any
simulated
murder
which
is
a
very
serious
offense
in
every
state
in
the
union?
justice
potter
stewart
why
isn't
that
any
more
true
of
a
simulated
fornication
or
adultery
which
are
in
most
states
offenses,
but
not
nearly
as
such
serious
offenses
as
murder.
why
is
a
simulated
act
of
that
kind
any
more
demoralizing
and
wouldn't
it
be
less
demoralizing
than
a
simulated
first
degree
murder
on
of
the
stage?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
othello
should
be
forbidden
shouldn't
it,
because
that
shows
a
first
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
nor
is
this
sexual,
it's
simulated?
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
see
the
play?
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
see
the
play?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
could
he
find
it
to
be
purely
obscene
and
not
obscene
without
having
ever
seen
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
pretty
much
after
the
playwright,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
director
or
the
actors?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
act
didn't
take
place
in
jenkins
against
georgia,
it
didn't
take
place
in
georgia,
the
act
took
place
in
hollywood,
california?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
wasn't
an
offense
assuming
georgia
had
the
same
law
or
ordinance,
it
wasn't
if
--
it
doesn't
take
place
within
that
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
word
lewd.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
--
some
of
the
criminal
laws
in
tennessee
is
common
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
statutory?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what,
with
beads?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
what
act
are
we
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
coming
down
off
the
stage
when
you're
on
the
public
sidewalk.
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
would
that
violate?
justice
potter
stewart
accept
the
cannon
of
(inaudible)
taste.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
what?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wasn't
the
reasoning
--
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
judge
--
it
was
frank
wilson
one
of
the
district
judge
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
play
of
othello
and
othello
actually
did
strangled
desdemona
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
killed
her?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
concept
is
different
from
an
obscenity
concept,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
--
do
you
mr.
--
the
question
attack
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
criminal
law
or
the
chattanooga
city
code,
section
25-28
which
makes
it
criminal
for
any
person
in
the
city
to
appear
in
a

a

justice
potter
stewart
in
a
public
place
--
in
a
public
place?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
--
what
if
--
one
of
the
actors
stole
money
from
the
other
--
from
another
actor
on
the
stage.
would
the
larceny
statute
be
unconstitutional
was
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
actually
stole
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
would
a
person's
choice
to
walk
around
without
any
clothes
on
also
the
first
amendment
right,
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
just
like
it
--
the
kind
of
clothes,
the
kind
of
necktie
a
person
might
wear
if
he
were
--
if
he
chose
to
wear
clothes.
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
his
hair
long
or
short,
why
isn't
that
protected
by
the
first
amendment
under
your
view
on
the
public
streets?
justice
potter
stewart
hair
styles
have
been
treated
by
many
courts
to
be
expressive
conduct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it's
been
treated
many,
many
times
repeatedly
in
many
lawsuits.
justice
potter
stewart
hell's
a'
poppin'
justice
potter
stewart
hell's
a'
poppin',
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
correctly
say,
the
theater
is
one
of
the
very
first
forms
of
expression,
but
the
common
quality
of
the
plays
and/or
the
moving

is
basically
that
it

isn't
it?

i

when
othello
strangles
desdemona,
you
don't
actually,
that
isn't
a
murder,
in

that's
a
simulated

justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
--that's
the
characteristic
of
plays
and
the
movies,
but
this
was
not
simulated
nudity.
this
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
actual
nudity,
and
did
run
afoul
you
say
it
perhaps
didn't
because
the
theater
wasn't
a
public
place
by
putting
that
to
one
side
and
assuming
the
theater
--
this
theater
was
a

it
directly
violated
an

not

as
such,
but
having

justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
--
well,
then
are
you
saying
that
this
ordinance
is
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
petitioner
refuse
to
sign
this
contract?
did
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
if
he
--
not
if
he
signed
the
contract
i
suppose,
you
never
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
do
it,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
show
never
took
place
in
this
auditorium?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don't
know,
but
you
never
gave
him
an
opportunity.
you
just
assumed
in
advance
that

would
break

is
that

in

he

justice

stewart
but
did
it
take
place
in
chattanooga?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
never
--
so,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
rely
on
this
contractual
language
when
you
never
gave

an
opportunity
to
sign

justice

had
he

and
then
violated
the

you
would
have
maybe
a
different
kind
of
an

or

justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
view
that
the
--
that
line
--
that
opening
line
of
the
play
that
you
just
quoted
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
violates
any

or
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
it's
generally
--
it's
generally
simulated
conduct.
in
other
words
the
--
it
is
human
beings
move,
walking
around
and
speaking
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
the
conduct
is
generally
simulated

the
murders
are
not
real
murders;
the
larcenies
are
not
real
larcenies,
that's
the
whole
--
that's
the
whole
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
quality
of
drama?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
--
now,
why
is
a
simulated

of
that
kind
any
worse
than
any
simulated
murder
which
is
a
very
serious
offense
in
every

justice
potter
stewart
why
isn't
that
any
more
true
of
a
simulated
fornication
or
adultery
which
are
in
most
states
offenses,
but
not
nearly
as
such
serious
offenses
as
murder.
why
is
a
simulated

of
that
kind
any
more
demoralizing
and
wouldn't
it
be
less
demoralizing
than
a
simulated
first
degree
murder
on
of
the
stage?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
othello
should
be
forbidden
shouldn't
it,
because
that
shows
a
first
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
nor
is
this
sexual,
it's
simulated?
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
see
the
play?
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't

justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
could
he
find

that's

isn't

so
the

didn't
take
place
in

against
georgia,
it
didn't
take
place
in
georgia,
the
act
took
place
in
hollywood,
california?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
wasn't
an
offense
assuming
georgia
had
the
same
law
or

it
wasn't
if
--
it
doesn't
take
place
within
that

justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
word
lewd.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
--
some
of
the
criminal

in
tennessee
is
common

isn't
it?
justice

not

justice

stewart
yes.

what,
with

justice

what
