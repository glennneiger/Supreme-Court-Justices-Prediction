justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
monaghan,
is
this
case
the
same
for
you
as
if
the
chattanooga
city
ordinance
that
it
tried
to
enforce
against
your
showing
in
private
theater
which
had
agreed
to
lease
it
to
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
then.
so,
could
the
city
of
chattanooga,
if
it
wanted
to,
have
an
auditorium
which
it
just
said
it
was
going
to
reserve
for
performances
which
were
suitable
for
the
entire
family,
including
minors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
butler
was
not
a
state
--
it
was
not
a
municipally
owned
bookstore?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
answer
is
in
effect,
“no,
the
city
couldn't
do
it.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
what
if
the
city
of
new
york
owns
the
--
owned
the
museum
of
modern
art
and
they
say
“we'll
open
it
to
private
showings,
but
it's
limited
to
modern
art.
we're
not
going
to
show
exhibitors
of
rembrandt,”
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
permissible?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
because
it
doesn't
involve
content
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assume
it
does
involve
content
discrimination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
suppressing
a
tremendous
amount
there,
a
priori,
you're
suppressing
all
art,
but
modern
art?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hell's
a'
poppin',
yeah.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
before
your
time.
(laughter)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
miller
said
that
simulated
sex
maybe
deemed
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
doesn't
it
--
it
doesn't
really
say
it
quite
in
the
way
you
said
it.
doesn't
it
say
that
the
state
may
proscribe
scenes
of
actual
sexual
conduct,
actual
or
simulated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
doesn't
an
individual
walking
in
the
streets
have
as
much
right
to
make
a
dramatic
expression
as
somebody
on
the
stage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
agree
with
you
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
it
could
die?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nelson,
do
you
think
your
case
is
any
better
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
sought
a
lease
from
a
municipally-owned
theater
then
if
it
were
simply
a
question
of
him
having
obtained
a
lease
in
a
private
theater
and
the
city
seeking
to
ban
the
production?
