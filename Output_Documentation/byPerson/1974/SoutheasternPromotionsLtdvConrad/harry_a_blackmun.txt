justice

this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
a
promoter
of
theatrical
productions.
it
desired
to
present
the
musical
“hair”
at
chattanooga
and
specifically
to
show
it
in
a
theater
operated
by
the
city.
on
the
basis
of
outside
reports,
the
municipal
board
charged
with
managing
the
theater
concluded
that
the
production
would
not
be
what
it
called
in
the
best
interest
of
the
community
and
it
rejected
the
application.
the
petitioner
sought
petitioner
sought
preliminary
injunctive
relief
in
federal
court,
this
was
denied.
and
then
the
petitioner
sought
a
permanent
injunction
and
several
months
later,
when
the
city
finally
filed
its
first
responsive
pleading,
the
district
court
held
a
hearing
on
the
content
of
the
musical
concluded
that
it
contained
obscene
conduct
not
entitled
the
first
amendment
protection
and
denied
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
divided
vote
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
board's
denial
constituted
a
prior
restraint.
a
system
of
prior
restraint
avoids
constitutional
infirmity
only
if
it
takes
place
under
procedural
safeguards
designed
to
obviate
the
dangers
of
a
censorship
system.
those
safeguards
include
the
placement
of
the
burden
of
instituting
judicial
proceedings
and
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
censor,
a
limitation
to
a
brief
period
of
any
restraint
before
judicial
review
and
the
assurance
of
a
prompt
judicial
determination.
those
safeguards
in
several
respects
were
lacking
here
and
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
action
of
the
board
violated
the
petitioner's
first
amendment
rights.
it
is
to
be
emphasized
as
we
do
in
the
opinion
that
this
is
a
decision
based
on
prior
restraint
procedure.
we
make
no
judgment
as
to
whether
the
musical
is
or
is
not
obscene
or
as
to
whether
the
courts
below
applied
an
incorrect
standard
for
the
determination
of
the
issue
of
obscenity.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
but
agreeing
with
the
court's
conclusion.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
it
by
the
chief
justice.
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
