justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
criminal
conduct
was
being
performed
on
the
stage,
i.e.,
indecent
exposure
or
whatever
it's
called
in
tennessee
that
there
is
an
ordinance
or
statute
making
indecent
exposure
a
criminal
act
and
that
act
was
being
performed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that
didn't
--
really
isn't
obscenity,
is
it?
it's
something
else.
it's
the
same
as
though
--
same
reasoning
as
though
you
had
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
city
that
had
an
ordinance
forbidding
minors
or
forbidding
the
producer
to
permit
the
minors
to
enter
the
showing
of
“hair”?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
under
16.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
what
if
it
were
--
what
if
the
answer
was
that
the
city
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
wouldn't
if
the
city
said,
“well,
we
almost
just
relentless,”
as
the
city
said
that,
“well,
we
just
reserve
our
municipal
facilities
for
events
to
which
all
the
people
may
come
and
all
attend
it?”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
that
answer
then
goes
back
to
saying
that
the
city
could
keep
minors
out
of
this
--
out
of
the
production
“hair?”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
i
said
that
let's
assume
that
it
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
just
goes
--
it
goes
to
saying
that
the
city
cannot
reserve
its
auditorium
for
events
to
which
all
the
people
may
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you're
wrong
on
that,
then
you
may
be
in
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
members
of
the
audience
that's
roaming
the
theater?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
of
course,
a
more
direct
approach
to
the
case,
whether
the
argument
--
what
you
argue
to
say
which
i
assume
to
say
it's
a
conduct
itself
isn't
obscene?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
these
judges
have
ever
saw
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
wrote
a
dissent?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
any
of
the
counsel
called
conduct
in
the
play
that
falls
within
that,
in
the
area
of
obscenity
described
in
the
miller
and
the
paris
adult
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
hardcore?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
courts
were
just
wrong
on
that
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
shouldn't
be
--
there
shouldn't
be
--
can
any
theater
presentation
be
obscene?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
--
how
could
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
was
mrs.
campbell,
wasn't
it
who
said
perform
in
the
street,
might
scare
the
horses.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
scare
any
horses.
justice
byron
r.
white
much
more
serious,
much
heavier
penalties
for
murder
than
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
--
essentially
you're
arguing
now
that
a
city
or
a
state
may
prevent
any
performances
in
a
private
theater
if
nudity
is
part
of
its
performance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright,
you
say
that
they
might
apply
it
to
a
performance
in
any
private
theater?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you're
saying
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
that
wouldn't
be
obscene
under
any
definition
of
obscenity,
just
nudity,
but
you're
saying
public
nudity
is
a
--
gives
the
--
gives
the
state
or
the
city
another
shot
at
prohibition.
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
this
nudity
in
a
motion
picture
is
obscene
under
the
definition
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
and
so
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
rule
in
a
private
theater?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
nudity
on
the
stage
is
--
nudity
on
a
stage
in
a
private
theater
is
not
obscene?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
saying
nudity
on
a
stage
in
a
private
theater
can
be
held
--
is
obscene
and
maybe
forbidden
by
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
state
may
prohibit
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it's
just
nudity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
may
not
be
obscene,
it
might
not
be
preventable
as
obscenity,
but
it
is
preventable
as
public
nudity?
justice
byron
r.
white
