we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1004,
southeastern
promotions
against
conrad.
mr.
monaghan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
arises
out
of
petitioner's
unsuccessful
efforts
to
gain
access
to
the
chattanooga,
tennessee
municipal
auditorium,
in
order
to
exhibit
the
rock-musical
"hair."
“hair”
is
a
rock-musical
which
describes
the
lifestyle
of
many
young
people
during
the
late
1960s
and
early
1970s
and
their
attitudes
on
such
matters
as
war,
the
vietnam
war,
racism,
drugs,
etcetera.
in
1967,
“hair”
opened
in
new
york.
since
then,
it
is
performed
in
140
cities
in
the
united
states
and
14
cities
throughout
the
rest
of
the
world.
it
has
received
widespread
critical
acclaim.
when
petitioner
began
to
produce
“hair”
in
the
smaller
communities
in
the
southeastern
and
southwestern
parts
of
the
united
states,
it
ran
into
considerable
difficulties.
in
these
smaller
communities,
the
municipal
auditorium
frequently
holds
a
strategic
position.
it
is
the
only
or
the
best
available
facility
for
the
production
of
a
major
play
and
in
these
communities,
many
municipal
officials
were
hostile
to
“hair's”
exhibition.
in
their
brief,
respondents
put
the
matter
as
follows.
they
say,
“many
local
officials
in
tune
with
the
standards
of
their
communities
and
particularly
those
in
the
so-called
bible
belt,
resisted
the
presentation
of
this
notorious
production”
and
claiming
unlimited
censorship
rights
to
determine
what
should
or
what
should
not
be
shown
in
the
municipal
theater,
these
municipal
officials
refused
“hair”
access
to
local
auditoriums.
federal
district
courts
enjoined
that
conduct
and
those
courts
which
did
not
do
so
were
reversed
upon
appeal.
this
case
began
in
such
a
fashion.
“hair”
applied
for
use
of
the
municipal
facility
in
chattanooga
and
these
respondents
refused
“hair”
access
because
they
testified,
exhibition
of
“hair”
would
not
be
and
i
quote
“in
the
best
interest
of
the
community”
nor
would
it
be
a
play
which
they
could
characterize
and
i
quote
“as
clean,
healthful
and
culturally
uplifting.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
of
these
other
cases
that
you've
mentioned
involving
this
production,
were
the
proceedings
brought
after
there
had
been
one
or
more
performances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
of
them
were
excluded
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
an
art
gallery,
to
pursue
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
thesis
a
moment,
what
if
an
art
gallery
--
public
gallery
had
a
fixed
rule
that
no
living
artist
could
be
exhibited?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
certainly
suppresses
a
modern
contemporary
expression,
does
it
not?
contemporary
artistic
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
there
some
--
aren't
there
some
place
in
which
part
of
the
play
or
performance
is
audience
participation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
not
a
very
common
thing
in
the
drama
and
quite
common
in
the
world
of
drama?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
about
--
what
about
it
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that's
a
precise
quotation
from
miller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
that
test
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
it
is
not
the
socially
redeeming
value
test?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
nelson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
mr.
monaghan
seem
to
say
today
that,
yes,
if
the
court
decided
in
his
favor
the
play
would
be
put
on
in
chattanooga
and
he
made
no
reservation
with
respect
to
it
being
put
on
in
any
different
way
from
what
the
stipulations
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
not
miller
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
didn't
the
miller
case
say
actual
or
simulated
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
you
take
it
out
the
othello
strangulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
weren't
applying
miller
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
even
assuming
--
even
assuming,
is
it
your
argument,
even
assuming
the
case
might
have
to
be
reversed
under
pre-miller
and
related
cases,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
remanded
because
of
the
intervening
decisions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you're
standing
first
on
the
violation
of
the
public
nudity
that
the
justice
stewart
alluded
to
earlier?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
tennessee
--
under
tennessee
law,
would
these
so-called
private
theaters
be
considered
public
places
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
public
in
a
sense
that
anyone
can
get
in
whose
got
three
or
six
or
seven
dollars,
whatever
the
price
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
in
one
of
the
briefs,
there
was
a
--
reference
to
or
an
effort
to
describe
the
theme
of
the
play
as
you
recall,
was
that
in
your
brief
or
in
mr.
monaghan's?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
outset
of
your
argument,
you
referred
i
think
to
an
opening
scene
or
at
least
an
early
scene
on
the
play
where
the
man
or
some
actor
leaped
off
the
stage
and
performed
certain
acts.
under
tennessee
law,
would
that
conduct
come
under
the
definition
of
lewd
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
would
--
i
take
it
that
it
would
follow
up
from
that
if
the
same
actor
performed
out
in
a
local
park,
in
front
of
the
theater
across
the
street
that
your
answer
would
be
that
that
would
be
clearly
subject
for
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
early
act
you've
just
described
is
what
you're
referring
to,
you
were
describing
the
act
that
occurred
when
he
came
off
of
the
stage.
if
he
performed
outside
in
the
sidewalk
in
the
public,
you
say
that
would
be
lewd
under
the
tennessee
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1004,
southeastern

mr.
monaghan,
you
may
proceed

you
are

may
it

the

this
