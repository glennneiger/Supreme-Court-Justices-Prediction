mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
joe
brecher
representing
the
chemehuevi
tribe
of
indians,
the
sierra
club,
several
individual
in
navajo
and
the
committee
to
save
black
mesa.
this
case
involves
perhaps
the
quintessential
environmental
nightmare
that
this
country
has
experienced
in
the
four
corners
power
plants
and
the
black
mesa
strip-mining
operation
and
that
involves
also
a
context
of
one
of
the
most
blatant
calls
for
judicial
legislation
i
have
ever
witnessed
on
the
part
of
the
power
companies
and
the
government.
the
language
of
the
statute
involved
here
could
be
no
more
clear
that
the
facilities
involved
in
this
case
are
covered
by
section
4
(e)
of
the
federal
power
act.
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
they
are
utilizing
surplus
water
from
a
government
dam
for
the
purpose
of
producing
electric
power.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
point
at
the
outset
that
this
is
not
merely
cooling
water
in
the
same
sense
that
water
and
then
automobile
radiator
cools
the
engine.
the
water
that's
used
in
the
thermal-electric
power
plant
is
an
essential
part
of
the
power
production
process
itself.
without
the
cooling
water,
power
production
at
these
plants
would
go
down
20
or
more
percent,
the
plants
would
be
inefficient
and
they
could
not
be
built.
so
the
water
used
in
the
thermal
plants
involved
in
this
case
is
an
inherent
part
of
the
production
process
and
therefore
in
a
very
real
sense,
this
water
is
being
used
to
produce
electric
power
rather
than
to
cool
machines,
which
are
producing
power
by
other
means.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
it
--
although
it
is
used
for
cooling,
the
cooling
process
itself
actually
results
in
more
megawatts
being
produced
because
it
makes
the
turbines
spin
faster
and
in
turn
more
megawatts
come
out.
and
you
could
you
not
have
a
thermal
plant
in
this
day
and
age
without
cooling
water.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
all
of
it,
your
honor
and
that's
an
important
point.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
except
for
the
four
corners
plant,
all
of
these
plants
will
evaporate
all
the
water
that
is
withdrawn
from
the
river
and
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
found
below
that
thermal
plants
will
have
more
of
an
effect
on
navigable
capacity
and
the
hydro
potential
of
a
stream
than
with
a
hydro
plant.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
that's
correct.
so
in
terms
of
the
power
potential
in
a
stream,
the
operations
of
thermal
plants
actually
would
have
much
more
of
an
effect
and
would
actually
deplete
the
amount
of
water
available
for
downstream
hydro
production.
this
would
not
be
true
for
a
hydro
plant.
so
if
any
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
as
well
as
the
project.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
i
think
that
they
are
--
i
am
addressing
myself
to
both.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
your
honor.
in
western
rivers,
especially
the
colorado
which
has
a
high
salinity
problem,
the
water
when
it's
used
for
cooling,
the
salts
that
are
already
in
the
water
become
more
concentrated.
and
if
that
water
were
to
be
released
to
the
stream
in
addition
to
the
thermal
problem,
which
what
you
have
recognized,
it
would
also
be
a
problem
of
increased
salinity
in
the
river.
and
since
salinity
levels
in
the
colorado
river
are
already
at
a
very
high
level,
none
of
these
plants
are
permitted
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
its
water
service
contracts
to
return
this
water
to
the
river.
thus,
the
colorado
river,
which
is
the
most
over
allocated
river
in
the
world,
is
further
depleted
by
the
activities
in
these
plants.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
they
evaporate
it
in
large
cooling
ponds
which
are
located
adjacent
to
the
plants
and
it
is
evaporated
by
sunlight.
and
that's
a
major
portion
of
the
plants
sites
are
devoted
to
the
cooling
ponds.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
main
purpose
of
that
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
it
is.
that
is
general.
however,
i
think
that
this
type
of
situation
will
see
accelerated
because
many
of
the
large
new
thermal
power
plants
in
the
new
phenomenon,
the
energy
complex
with
which
we
are
dealing
here
exists
only
in
the
west
and
salinity
in
rivers
is
a
western
water
problem,
which
is
becoming
more
and
more
apparent.
and
this
is
true
not
only
on
the
colorado
but
on
the
yellow
stone
river
in
montana
which
is
another
major
energy
complex
source
which
will
soon
have
problems
very
similar
to
the
colorado
river.
and
although
the
northern
great
plains
coal
development
situation
has
not
reached
the
upper
proportions
of
the
colorado
river
situation.
it
will,
soon
if
plants
that
are
now
at
foot
go
into
effect.
so,
that
we
will
be
seeing
this
type
of
operation,
thermal
plants
which
had
deplete
water
resources.
this
will
become
much
more
common
as
western
coal
and
energy
has
developed
further.
this
problem
is
in
its
infancy
and
we
are
seeing
the
first
flash
of
it
now.
now
i
mentioned
the
fact
the
power
companies
and
the
government
are
arguing
flagrantly
judicial
legislation,
and
this
is
what
they
argue.
although
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
quite
obviously
covers
the
facilities
involved
here,
there
should
be
run
in
to
the
statute
a
proviso
that
says
none
of
these
language
shall
apply
to
steam
or
thermal-electric
power
plants.
what
is
the
basis
for
this
additional
language
which
they
claim
should
be
involved
here.
no
canon
of
statutory
construction
that
i
know
of
allows
it
and
in
fact
several
important
canons
to
which
this
court
has
long
adhered
would
militate
against
the
addition
of
this
language.
first,
there
is
the
plain
meaning
rule.
now
the
plain
meaning
rule
is
based
on
very
sound
traditions
of
a
judicial
construction.
first,
the
language
of
a
statute
should
be
understandable
to,
and
accessible
by
the
common
man
and
the
common
lawyer
i
may
add.
the
material
which
is
relied
on
here
to
vary
that
meaning
as
mr.
justice
jackson
pointed
out
eloquently
throughout
his
career
in
this
court
is
available
only
to
a
few
legal
specialists
located
in
the
larger
cities.
i
myself
had
a
very
difficult
time
working
in
denver
of
getting
my
hands
on
the
material
which
is
cited
in
the
supplement.
and
what
--
if
the
plain
meaning
rule
is
buried
in
this
way,
it
means
not
only
a
few
specialists
are
going
to
be
able
to
interpret
the
statute
which
originally
was
designed
to
aid
the
public
to
be
understandable
by
the
public.
and
we
don't
claim
that
the
plain
meaning
rule
should
govern
overall
sense.
obviously,
if
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
is
completely
in
variance
with
what
the
framers
of
the
statute
had
in
mind
or
if
it
would
lead
to
absurd
or
impractical
consequences,
then
we
must
explicate
the
statute.
we
must
go
behind
to
see
what
congress
had
in
mind.
and
indeed,
this
court
has
recognized
that.
but
that
is
a
very
narrow
exception
to
a
very
well-established
rule
and
we
maintain
that
in
this
present
case.
there
is
no
reason
for
applying
that
exception.
obviously,
we
do
not
have
an
absurd
or
impractical
consequence
by
giving
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
either
under
the
surplus
water
clause
or
under
the
project
works
clause
over
steam
power
plants.
in
fact,
the
commission
itself
was
asked
for
this
jurisdiction
repeatedly.
so
it
certainly
would
not
be
absurd
and
it
is
certainly
would
not
be
impractical.
and
indeed,
the
commission
has
stated
that
based
on
what
it
conceives
as
its
present
statutory
mandate,
this
additional
activity
would
fit
in
well,
would
complement
itself
well
with
the
statutory
mandated
as
it
now
exist.
now,
do
we
have
--
if
steam
plant
licensing
were
allowed,
do
we
have
a
situation
where
the
purposes
of
the
act
would
violated
or
a
violence
would
be
done
to
them.
again
no,
because
one
of
the
--
perhaps
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act
as
mentioned
by
the
power
companies
and
the
government
was
to
promote
hydroelectric
development
and
we
do
not
quarrel
with
that.
we
do
believe
that
hydroelectric
development
was
upper
most
in
the
minds
of
congress
when
they
enacted
the
federal
power
act.
but
there
are
other
social
phenomena
that
they
attempted
to
take
care
of
in
the
very
same
legislation.
several
threads
of
thought
that
conservation
is
in
the
early
1900's
had
been
working
on
came
together
in
the
federal
power
act.
and
two
other
purposes
should
be
borne
in
mind.
first,
was
a
general
purpose
to
achieve
comprehensive
development
of
the
nation's
waterways.
indeed,
one
of
the
immediate
statutory
antecedence
of
the
federal
power
act
was
an
act
creating
a
waterways
commission
to
unify
the
development
of
our
rivers
for
purposes
having
nothing
to
do
with
power,
having
to
do
with
irrigation
and
other
uses.
and
although
we
do
not
contend
that
the
federal
power
act
deals
with
the
use
water
for
other
than
power
production
purposes,
they
are
definitely
it
was
the
sense
of
congress
that
unified
development
of
the
nation's
waterways
was
an
important
purpose
of
the
federal
power
act.
the
second
important
purpose
was
to
make
sure
that
private
power
companies
were
not
allowed
to
appropriate
for
themselves
without
the
government's
supervision
and
inappropriate
cases
without
appropriate
charges,
the
power
potential
and
navigable
streams.
in
the
present
case
in
order
to
effectuate
those
two
purposes
behind
the
federal
power
act,
that
is
comprehensive
development
of
waterways
and
making
sure
that
the
public's
property
was
protected,
regulation
of
thermal
power
plants
is
absolutely
essential.
there
is
going
to
be
a
no
more
hydroelectric
development
in
this
country
of
any
consequence.
and
the
waterways
of
this
country
used
in
connection
with
power
will
be
used
only
in
connection
with
thermal
plants.
if
the
construction
argued
for
by
the
power
companies
and
the
government
is
allowed
to
continue,
the
power
companies
will
have
achieve
by
the
backdoor,
what
the
congress
had
setout
to
stop
them
from
doing
in
1920.
that
is
appropriating
for
themselves
without
any
government
supervision
or
control,
the
hydro
potential
in
navigable
streams.
they
will
do
that
by
sucking
all
the
water
out
of
the
river
and
not
making
it
available
for
downstream
dams.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
no
sir,
we
recognize
fully
the
secretary's
jurisdiction
but
we
do
not
think
it
precludes
the
fpc
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
then
we
believe
that
the
court
below
was
wrong.
we
believe
that
the
project
works
clause
would
still
govern
and
the
literal
language
of
that
clause
would
require
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
that
is
generally
true,
except
for
the
limit
of
the
exception
for
the
colorado
river
and
a
few
other
rivers
where
there
is
special
legislation
given,
whether
there
is
no
legislation
and
indeed
that
was
recognized
by
the
court
below.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
no,
your
honor.
he
has
that
power
only
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
i'm
sorry.
he
has
that
power
only
because
of
the
law
of
the
colorado
river
as
it
is
developed,
but
that
is
not
the
usual
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
you
do
in
most
cases,
either
from
the
bureau
of
reclamation
or
the
corps
of
engineers
or
whatever
the
governing
agency
is.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
your
honor,
but
we
believe
that
that
type
of
reg
--
there
are
two
types
of
regulations
which
have
been
recognized
by
the
courts.
and
i
would
call
the
type
of
regulation
you
are
speaking
of
political
regulation
as
supposed
to
agency
regulation.
the
consequences
are
quite
different.
there
is
no
public
participation
for
example
in
a
decision
by
the
secretary
to
allocate
water.
the
public
cannot
present
witnesses,
it
cannot
cross-examine,
it
cannot
participate
in
proceedings,
there
is
no
judicial
review
and
it
is
virtually
unfettered
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
federal
agency.
in
contrast
before
the
federal
power
commission,
the
public
has
very
well-defined
rights
to
participate
in
the
proceedings.
and
in
fact,
if
those
rights
had
been
exercised
in
this
case,
we
would
not
have
the
terrible
four
corner
situation
we
have,
where
the
citing
of
these
plants
was
done
on
a
helter-skelter
basis
without
considerations
of
national
policy,
which
the
federal
power
commission
under
the
dictates
of
this
court
in
the
high
mountain
sheep
case
has
said
it
so
important.
so
that
--
although
it
is
regulation
and
there
is
some
government
participation,
there
is
no
public
participation.
and
one
of
the
main
thrust
of
the
federal
power
act
was
to
make
sure
that
the
public,
not
just
the
government
was
able
to
participate
in
the
decision-making
as
to
how
our
water
would
be
used.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
he
does.
he
has
to
comply
with
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
but
the
protections
available
to
the
public
under
that
act
are
far
different
from
those
under
the
federal
power
commission.
and
there
are
subs
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
well,
they
have
after
the
fact
participation
only.
they
may
comment
on
an
environmental
impact
statement
but
they
can
have
no
substantive
change.
there
is
no
substantive
input
from
that.
all
that's
required
is
that
an
impact
statement
be
filed
under
nepa.
but
once
the
statement
details
the
environmental
disaster,
the
secretary
is
free
to
go
ahead
regardless
of
the
consequences
under
nepa
and
that
is
an
important
distinction.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
when
the
suit
was
filled,
one
plant
was
in
full
operation,
most
--
four
of
the
other
plants
were
just
beginning
construction
and
that
is
why
we
ask
for
an
injunction
originally.
obviously,
at
this
point,
we're
not
going
to
ask
that
these
power
plants
that
are
so
important
in
producing
power
for
the
west
be
shutdown
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
at
this
point,
we
would
ask
the
kaiparowits
plant
which
is
in
the
planning
stage
be
held
up
until
a
license
is
granted
and
that
operations
of
the
other
plants
could
go
on
while
the
licensing
proceedings
took
place.
you
see,
under
the
federal
power
act
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
we
would
or
at
least
we
would
advocate
that
a
condition
is
to
be
attached
to
the
license
to
clean
up
some
of
the
environmental
mess
which
has
been
associated
with
these
plants
and
which
the
so-called
regulation
of
the
other
federal
agencies
has
not
obtained
at
all.
environmental
protection
agency
has
found
that
one
time
or
another
that
every
single
one
of
these
plants
is
violating
clean
air
statutes.
there
have
been
a
mass
of
outcries
by
virtually
every
government
agency
about
one
or
another
environmental
defect.
nonetheless,
the
plants
go
forward
and
this
shows
the
difference
in
quality
between
the
so-called
regulation
of
the
secretary
under
his
contract
authority
and
the
kind
of
regulation
one
would
have
if
the
federal
power
commission
were
involved
because
there
is
substantive
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
well,
they
have
been,
but
delays
go
on,
the
plants
continue
violating
the
standards.
and
so
far,
there
has
been
remarkably
little
action.
the
mohave
plant
for
example
has
been
given
four
or
five
variances
so
far
and
the
end
of
that
process
is
nowhere
in
sight.
it
is
being
contested
but
nothing
is
being
done.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
we
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
i
think
that
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility,
your
honor.
but
very
unlikely
under
the
circumstances
of
these
cases
for
the
very
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
the
assumption
that
you
stated
that
the
plants
could
be
closed
down
if
the
commission
found
that
a
license
should
not
be
granted
under
the
federal
power
act.
however,
we
have
many
--
this
court
has
come
up
with
many
situations
where
the
law
changed
and
the
retroactive
licensing
was
required
and
we
believe
that
this
would
be
just
another
case
of
the
same
kind.
a
private
individual
is
not
allowed
to
rely
on
a
misconstruction
of
the
statute
by
an
agency
and
if
that
misconstruction
is
corrected,
then
it
must
abide
by
the
law
regardless
of
whatever
reliance
had
placed
in
the
law
if
it
was
wrong.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
although
frankly,
i
don't
think
any
of
parties
in
the
particular
case
would
argue
for
that
result.
obviously,
we
are
realist
here
too
but
we
are
not
up
to
this
point.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
that
legal
principle,
although
it
sounds
hard,
it
is
the
correct
one
to
be
argued
here.
that
even
though
they
had
placed
reliance
on
this
improper
interpretation
of
the
law,
they
would
be
liable
in
any
event
to
have
their
plants
dismantled
if
that
were
required.
now
when
we
turn
to
the
legislative
history,
which
is
suppose
to
preclude
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
we
find
that
that
history
consist
of
a
negative
rather
than
a
positive.
nowhere
have
they
pointed
to
a
single
instance
in
which
any
member
of
congress
said
that
steam
plants
are
not
be
licensed.
instead,
they
point
to
the
fact
that
steam
plants
were
not
mentioned,
or
if
they
were,
they
were
mentioned
in
other
context.
and
they
draw
from
the
inference
that
therefore,
steam
plants
are
not
to
be
licensed
under
the
act.
we
believe
that
this
violates
a
premise
that
chief
justice
marshall
stated
way
back
in
the
1830's
which
is,
that
if
you
have
a
situation
that
appears
to
be
covered
by
statutory
language
and
that
particular
situation
was
not
mentioned
by
congress,
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
it
was
not
mentioned.
there
must
be
an
affirmative
showing
that
congress
had
it
been
confronted
with
the
facts
involved
in
the
case
would
have
said,
“no,
we
do
not
want
to
regulate.”
now
i
would
like
to
ask
this
court
to
imagine
the
conservation
this
congress
of
1919
and
1920
being
confronted
with
the
kaiparowits
power
plant
using
a
102,000
acre
feet
of
scarce
colorado
river
water.
water
which
would
then
not
be
available
at
four
downstream
hydro
--
federal
hydroelectric
projects,
water
which
would
be
depleted
forever
from
the
river
system,
water
which
would
be
necessary
for
the
intelligent
planning
of
that
system.
and
as
whether
in
view
of
the
purpose
of
congress
to
promote
comprehensive
development
of
waterways
and
to
assure
that
private
power
interest
do
not
appropriate
that
public
resources
whether
the
congress
would
have
said,
whether
we
can
say
with
assurance,
congress
would
have
said,
“no,
we
do
not
want
to
regulate
this
power
plant.”
and
i
maintain
that
we
cannot
say
on
the
strength
of
the
legislative
history
that's
been
offered
to
us.
now,
it's
argued
that
the
secretary's
power
on
the
colorado
river
supersedes
any
power
that
the
federal
power
commission
could
have.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
weakest
argument
that
has
been
advanced
by
the
power
companies
for
number
of
reasons.
one,
the
two
main
statutes
relied
on
by
them,
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
and
the
colorado
river
storage
project
act,
both
take
away
fpc
jurisdiction
either
for
a
limited
time
on
the
colorado
or
for
a
limited
space
on
the
colorado,
but
by
implication
would
retain
jurisdiction
on
the
rest
of
the
river.
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
says
that
the
commission's
jurisdiction
on
the
colorado
shall
temporarily
seize
until
the
act
shall
have
been
ratified.
that
act
of
course
was
ratified
in
1921
and
so
by
implication
fpc
jurisdiction
continues.
in
the
colorado
river
storage
project
act,
the
congress
went
to
the
trouble
of
excluding
fpc
jurisdiction
on
a
short
stretch
of
the
river
between
the
grand
canyon
and
lake
mead.
if
there
were
no
jurisdiction
there
originally,
why
would
it
be
necessary
to
take
the
jurisdiction
away
in
the
statutory
contract
--
context?
furthermore,
the
commission
itself
has
held
hearings,
licensing
hearings
and
those
hearings
have
been
participated
in
by
the
secretary
concerning
this
very
portion
the
colorado
river
involved
here.
the
proposed
marble
canyon
dam
in
1962
was
on
this
very
stretch
of
the
river.
if
the
f
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
but
their
contention,
your
honor
is
that
there
is
no
fpc
jurisdiction
period
and
obviously
there
is
because
of
the
parties
involved
have
in
fact
participated
in
that
kind
of
proceeding.
furthermore,
even
if
we
are
to
accept
this
argument,
two
of
the
power
plants
involved
in
this
case,
the
four
corners
and
huntington
canyon
plants
are
not
covered
by
the
contracts
of
the
secretary.
they
do
not
have
water
service
contracts
with
the
secretary.
they
have
obtained
their
water
by
the
usual
method
from
the
states
involved
so
that
the
secretary's
jurisdiction,
even
if
it
existed
could
not
supersede
fpc
jurisdiction
as
to
those
two
power
plants.
in
short,
there
is
very
--
and
finally,
i
may
add,
if
this
court
looks
at
the
nantahala
power
case,
which
involved
the
tva
and
the
federal
power
commission;
we
had
a
situation
very
similar.
as
you
are
aware,
the
tennessee
valley
authority
has
very,
very
broad
authority
over
the
allocation
and
distribution
of
water
in
the
tennessee
valley.
far
more
power
than
the
secretary
of
interior
exercises
in
the
colorado.
nonetheless,
it
was
held
in
the
nantahala
power
case
that
the
federal
power
commission
still
had
a
voice
in
deciding
the
allocation
of
that
water,
at
least
as
far
power
plants
are
concerned.
even
more
important,
the
type
of
regulation
being
done
by
the
secretary,
the
scope
and
concerns
the
secretary
has
is
different
from
that
of
the
federal
power
commission.
for
one
thing
the
commission
is
a
national
commission
and
it
can
take
into
account
and
indeed
is
required
to
take
into
account
more
than
the
secretary
is
in
awarding
his
contracts.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
he
is
your
honor.
but
he
hasn't
acted
as
one
in
the
context
of
these
cases
because
he
is
allowed
--
he
hasn't
for
example
ever
done
what
the
commission
could
do,
mainly
saying,
“yes,
you
may
have
the
water
but
don't
locate
the
plants
at
this
particular
spot.
move
them
in
some
place
where
the
area
is
less
scenic,
where
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
well
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
i
--
well,
the
difference
is
that
the
secretary's
authority
is
confined
to
the
colorado
river
basin
whereas
the
federal
power
commission
oversees
the
entire
power
industry
throughout
the
nation
and
the
federal
power
commission
may
well
serve.
for
example,
“yes,
we
should
mine
western
coal.
we
should
use
it
for
producing
electric
power,
but
let
us
not
put
it
in
the
colorado
river
system.
let's
use
some
other
river
system
which
is
not
so
badly
overburdened
and
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
there
are
number
of
alternative
sources,
such
as
using
sea
water
for
example
or
using
the
great
salt
lake,
or
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
several
power
plants
now
being
planned
southeastern
utah
which
will
use
ground
water
and
agricultural
runoff
rather
than
water
from
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river.
and
these
are
alternatives
that
could
have
been
applied
back
in
the
1960's
when
the
secretary
was
making
his
decision
as
to
these
power
plants.
and
if
there
had
been
an
fpc
proceeding,
those
alternatives
could
have
been
developed
by
public
intervenors
such
as
we
are
and
perhaps
a
system
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
the
return
water
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
a
lot
of
it
goes
back
into
the
river
and
contributes
to
the
salinity
problem.
and
now
it
is
under
the
plants
that
are
now
being
formulated,
it
will
be
evaporated
and
so
salinity
will
be
decreased.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
well,
on
the
--
for
these
particular
plants,
it
is
a
condition
of
the
water
service
contracts
that
the
secretary
entered
into
the
power
plants.
presumably,
the
environmental
protection
agency
would
have
adopted
similar
regulations
under
its
general
water
pollution
control
authority
under
the
water
pollution
at
all.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
there
--
if
the
water
were
returned?
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
that
would
depend
on
how
and
where
it
will
return.
for
example,
if
the
water
bypassed
the
government
dam
which
is
as
conceivable
situation
and
that
water
were
not
allowed
to
flow
over
in
an
intermediate
dam,
yes
it
would.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
yes,
but
our
clients
are
also
--
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
that's
right
and
in
fact
our
clients
are
vitally
affected
by
that.
the
cocopah
tribe
is
located
just
above
the
mexican
border
and
the
water
that
they
receive
down
the
river
by
the
time
it
gets
to
them
is
so
saline
that
a
lot
of
crops
are
already
precluded
from
growth
there.
so
they
have
a
vital
interest
in
that
too.
i
think
it
is
a
particularly
deadly
kind
of
pollution
in
the
southwest.
it
is
the
most
deadly
kind
because
other
types
of
pollution
can
be
dealt
with
by
treatment,
but
dealing
with
salinity
is
a
very
difficult
and
expensive
problem,
almost
insurmountable.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
well,
if
you
ever
tasted
los
angles
water,
you
know
that
it's
not.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
that's
true
--
that's
true
for
the
colorado
river
water
probably
above
the
parker
dam,
but
bellow
the
parker
dam,
you
can't
drink
it.
i
don't
think
anybody
drinks
it
there
in
bottled
water
--
in
yuma,
bottled
is
a
rule
rather
than
the
exception.
and
i
know
my
clients
rarely
drink
that
stuff.
mr.
joseph
j.
brecher
it's
what
it
is
--
i
think
--
i
believe
it's
treated
for
salinity.
