we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
73-1380
and
1666,
1667,
chemehuevi
tribe
of
indians
against
the
federal
power
commission
and
related
cases.
mr.
wallace
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ely.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
ely.
mr.
brecher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
we
have
seen
not
in
this
court
but
in
other
courts,
there
has
been
litigation
about
the
use
of
the
water
for
cooling
purposes.
and
one
of
the
major
complaints
was
that
it
raise
the
temperature,
i
think
one
case
of
the
river
20%
because
the
water
would
turn
to
the
river
in
which
it
was
taken
for
the
cooling
process,
was
it
a
higher
--
much
higher
temperature
now.
are
you
sure
that
you're
correct
when
you
say
that
none
of
the
water
is
returned
after
the
cooling
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
--
is
that
only
to
deal
with
the
salinity
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
within
the
rivers,
in
dealing
with
rivers
where
there
is
no
such
salinity
problem,
there
is
no
barrier
chemically
or
otherwise
to
putting
the
water
back
in
and
that
is
done,
is
it
not
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
to
the
point
of
dismantling
a
plant
to
get
down
to
the
hard
realities
or
terminating
its
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you're
arguing
some
legal
principles
here.
we
have
to
deal
with
it
on
that
basis.
don't
we
not
on
the
basis
of
what
some
people
might
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
authority
is
it
that
precludes
the
return
on
that
cooling
water
to
the
colorado
river,
is
it
state
federal,
secretary
of
interior,
federal
power
commission,
who
stops
them
from
returning
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
return
for
this
water,
which
you
have
said
is
a
matter
of
peculiar
to
the
colorado
river,
the
return
of
it
would
not
impair
its
function
for
producing
new
power
downstream,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
salinity
problem,
is
it
not
entirely
a
pollution
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ely,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
give
us
a
little
time
to
find
it,
mr.
ely.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
what
letter
of
the
paragraph?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
ely.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
stewart
will
announce
a
group
of
three
consolidated
cases
and
two
consolidated
cases.
