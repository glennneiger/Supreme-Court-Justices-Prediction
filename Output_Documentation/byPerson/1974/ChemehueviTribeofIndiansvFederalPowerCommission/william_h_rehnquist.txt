justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
authority
over
of
a
citing
of
thermal-electric
plants,
that
the
commission
itself
would
be
quite
independent
of
the
existence
of
surplus
water,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean
it
would
be
a
much
more
generalized
authority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it
isn't
just
the
powers
of
the
secretary,
it's
also
a
matter
of
state
law
and
it
may
depend
on
a
law
of
the
state
i
take
it
as
to
whether
particular
plant
can
be
approved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
the
secretary
owns
the
water
behind
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
they
do
with
the
water
if
they
don't
--
with
the
excess
if
they
do
not
return
it
to
the
river?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
you
have
water
stored
behind
the
dam
and
in
the
western
states,
it
is
not
in
the
colorado
system.
don't
you
have
to
at
least
have
contact
with
the
bureau
of
reclamation
or
approval
of
the
bureau
to
take
water
of
behind
that
dam?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there's
federal
regulation
of
some
sort
of
removal
from
water
behind
the
dam,
quite
apart
whether
it
is
the
colorado
river
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
the
plants
violate
clean
air
statutes?
can't
they
be
prosecuted
under
those
statutes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
a
hydroelectric?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
secretary
a
national
secretary,
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
--
that's
just
a
complain
about
the
way
the
authority
has
been
exercised.
i
don't
see
how
that
bares
on
the
existence
of
the
authority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
to
say
that
one
is
national
and
the
other
isn't.
you
got
a
secretary
appointed
by
the
president.
you
got
federal
power
commissioners
appointed
by
the
president.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
river
system
would
you
use
other
than
the
colorado
to
supply
the
people
in
the
southwestern
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
salinity
problem
is
basically
pollution
in
the
ordinary
sense,
but
it's
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
deliver
a
certain
amount
of
water
to
mexico
by
certain
standard
and
because
of
all
the
salinity,
the
mexicans
complain
that
water
isn't
up
to
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
it
doesn't
affect
the
drinking
quality
though
--
our
people
drink
saline
water.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
are
20
million
of
them
drinking
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
the
city
water
works
that
certainly
takes
water
out
of
the
river.
