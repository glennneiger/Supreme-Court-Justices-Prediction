didn't
the
commission
in
1962
try
to
get
from
congress
the
jurisdiction
that
they
recurred?
justice
potter
stewart
along
the
river?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
still
the
commission's
policy
or
desire?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
it's
a
view
of
some
of
the
parties
here,
as
i
understand
it
at
least
that
there
are
some
of
the
amicus
--
amici
that
with
respect
to
this
particular
river,
the
secretary
has
a
great
deal
of
authority.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
interior
department?
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
that's
the
whole
--
that's
the
whole
process
of
one
of
the
briefs
there,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
potter
stewart
supposedly,
project
works?
justice
potter
stewart
its
use
is
for
cooling
purposes
and
is
the
water
consumed
or
is
it
all
returned
at
a
higher
temperature
to
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
cooling
water,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)is
returned
in
the
river,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
at
a
higher
temperature?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
is
it
consumed?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
mr.
ely
can
tell
us.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
the
alternative
sources
of
power
available
if
these
plants
were
shutdown?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ely,
i'm
not
--
i
think
you
said
--
maybe
i
missed
it,
but
it
seemed
to
me
you
said
two
some
of
the
inconsistent
thing,
a
--
that
the
decision
was
up
to
the
states
as
how
the
water
was
to
be
used,
it
was
allocated
to
them
and
then
i
think
you
said,
it
was
up
--
the
decision
was
up
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
the
--
let
us
assume
that
the
certain
amount
of
water
is
allocated
to
a
state,
then
is
it
up
to
the
state?
is
the
state
free
to
decide
how
that
water
is
going
to
be
used?
justice
potter
stewart
so
your
point
is
that
whatever
jurisdiction
the
commission
may
or
may
not
have
in
this
area
on
other
rivers
at
least
with
respect
to
water
from
the
colorado
river,
it
has
none
because
it's
been
superseded?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
compact
with
--?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
to
summarize
that
again
--
how
to
use
other
than
cooling?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
the
water
--
of
the
cooling
water
is
consumed?
justice
potter
stewart
none
is
returned
to
the
river?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
hydro
doesn't
ultimately
use
any
water.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
but
it
doesn't
consume
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
you're
directing
yourself
now
to
the
surplus
water
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
one
afterward
project?
justice
potter
stewart
at
this
point,
your
argument
is
the
surplus
water?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
just
static,
water
that's
too
saline
is
no
good
for
irrigation.
justice
potter
stewart
people
who'd
taste
it
everyday.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
is
because
that
the
water
is
not
going
to
be
returned
to
the
river,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
think
if
water
is
taken
out
and
not
returned,
i
do
not
see
how
anybody
could
possibly
conjecture
that
the
salinity
would
be
increased.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
does
take
water
out
of
the
river.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
self-evident,
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
this
is
a
very
far
field
from
the
issues
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
should
mention
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
bench
here
has
invited
this
with
your
involving
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
taum
sauk
case
the
same
as
the
union
electric?
justice
potter
stewart
union
electric
case.
justice
potter
stewart
taking
the
three
first,
they
are
no.
73-1380,
chemehuevi
tribe
of
indians
and
others
against
the
federal
power
commission
and
others,
no.
73-1666
arizona
public
service
company
and
others,
petitioners,
against
the
chemehuevi
tribe
of
indians,
and
73-1667,
the
federal
power
commission,
petitioner,
against
the
chemehuevi
tribe
of
indians
and
others.
in
these
three
cases,
we
review
a
single
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
determine
whether
thermal
electric
power
generating
plants
that
draw
cooling
water
from
navigable
streams
are
subject
to
the
licensing
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
under
part
i
of
the
federal
power
act.
we
have
concluded
that
such
power
plants
are
not
subject
to
that
jurisdiction.
the
question
is
an
important
one
but
the
court's
opinion
does
not
lend
itself
to
extensive
oral
announcement
involving
as
it
does
complex
statutory
analysis
and
a
review
of
some
54
years
of
legislative
history.
suffice
it
to
say
that
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
considerable
detail
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today,
the
judgment
before
us
is
vacated
and
the
cases
are
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
directions
to
enter
a
judgment
affirming
the
commission's
dismissal
of
the
complaint
for
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
