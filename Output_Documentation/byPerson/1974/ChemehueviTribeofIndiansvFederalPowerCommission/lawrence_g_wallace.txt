mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
complainants
who
are
two
indian
tribes,
two
environmental
organizations
and
several
individuals
brought
a
proceeding
in
the
federal
power
commission
seeking
to
require
the
intervening
companies
to
apply
for
licenses
for
six
existing
and
planned
thermal-electric
facilities
in
the
so-called
four
corners
area
of
the
southwest,
all
of
which
draw
their
cooling
waters
from
various
places
in
the
colorado
river
system
but
none
of
which
draw
their
cooling
waters
from
any
project
licensed
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
claim
was
made
that
the
commission
has
jurisdiction,
licensing
jurisdiction
over
these
plants
both
under
the
so-called
project
works
clause
and
because
the
plants
use
surplus
water
from
government
dams
or
at
least
arguably
some
of
them
do.
the
commission
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
basis
of
its
longstanding
interpretation
that
part
one
of
the
act
gives
a
jurisdiction
to
license
only
hydroelectric
facilities
and
not
thermal-electric
facilities
whether
they're
fossil-fueled
burning
facilities
or
atomic
facilities.
that
the
jurisdiction
under
both
clauses
of
the
act
is
limited
to
the
licensing
of
project
works
or
the
use
of
surplus
water
by
hydroelectric
facilities
which
use
water
power
for
the
generation
of
electricity,
the
power
of
falling
water.
on
review,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
commission
in
rejecting
the
principal
contention
that
was
being
made
in
the
case
under
the
project
works
clause
but
how
did
the
commission
does
have
licensing
authority
with
respect
to
the
use
of
surplus
water
by
thermal-electric
plants
and
ordered
the
case
remanded
to
the
commission
to
determine
whether
surplus
water
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
was
being
used
by
these
facilities
and
the
relationship
between
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
the
jurisdiction
of
other
federal
agencies
who
have
the
authority
over
the
disposition
of
the
water
at
the
various
projects
involved
in
the
colorado
system.
this
court
granted
cross-petitions
for
certiorari
and
by
agreement
of
the
parties,
the
opening
briefs
on
all
issues
were
filed
by
the
power
commission
and
the
intervenor
companies
and
i
will
be
speaking
for
20
minutes
for
the
power
commission
and
mr.
ely
will
be
speaking
for
10
minutes
for
the
intervenor
companies.
at
the
outset,
now
the
issue
has
not
been
contested
in
this
court
before
is
not
a
new
issue
in
this
court.
in
1965,
in
a
case
titled
federal
power
commission
against
union
electric
company,
in
volume
381
u.s.,
all
nine
justices
addressed
the
issue
in
the
context
of
determining
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
commission
to
license
a
pumped-storage
plant
and
the
case
was
decided
on
the
premise
that
the
commission
has
no
licensing
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
thermal-electric
facilities,
a
premise
that
was
accepted
by
all
parties
in
that
case.
and
previously,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
an
opinion
of
this
court
in
1953,
united
states
against
public
utilities
commission,
and
this
is
explained
in
the
appendix
on
page
89
(a)
and
footnote
123
that
opinion
of
this
court
by
mr.
justice
reed
was
written
on
the
assumption
that
the
commission
has
no
licensing
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
thermal-electric
facilities.
nonetheless,
at
the
outset
of
the
complainants
argue
in
this
court
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
precludes
the
interpretation
of
the
act
to
which
all
nine
justices
subscribed
in
the
union
electric
case
and
which
was
also
reflected
in
the
opinion
in
the
public
utilities
commission
case
by
mr.
justice
reed.
this
obviously
is
a
difficult
argument
to
make
but
it's
being
made
in
the
context
of
a
statute
in
which
the
legislative
history
is
quite
devastating
to
the
position
that
they
are
espousing.
in
our
brief,
and
more
elaborately
in
the
intervenor's
brief,
we've
addressed
the
problems
with
the
language
of
the
act
and
why
the
language
can
be
construed
and
perhaps
more
reasonably
should
be
construed
on
its
face
in
favor
of
our
interpretation
of
the
act
and
the
interpretation
previously
reflected
in
the
court's
opinions.
i
don't
propose
to
rehearse
that
during
the
argument
because
it
seems
to
us
too
late
in
the
day
after
54
years
of
interpretation
by
the
commission
after
pronouncements
and
opinions
of
this
court,
after
a
major
reenactment
by
congress
in
1935
in
light
of
the
commission's
interpretations
for
us
to
think
that
this
issue
can
be
decided
on
the
bare
words
of
the
statute
without
looking
beyond
them.
and
i
might
say
after
widespread
reliance
during
those
54
years
by
not
only
the
industry
but
by
our
consumers
of
electric
power.
and
so,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
right
in
examining
the
legislative
history
in
detail
as
it
did
with
respect
to
the
contention
under
the
project
works
clause
and
basically
we're
in
agreement
with
that
aspect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
analysis
which
showed
that
the
original
part
one
of
the
federal
power
act
which
was
called
the
federal
water
power
act
was
in
its
antecedents
and
in
its
enactment,
concerned
exclusively
with
giving
federal
licensing
authority
over
the
development
of
hydroelectric
power.
the
dominant
concern
in
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
was
to
foster
the
maximum
development
and
utilization
of
hydroelectric
power
so
as
to
minimize
the
extent
to
which
fossil
fuels
would
have
to
be
consumed
in
the
production
of
power
and
pollution
would
occur
from
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels.
it
was
assumed
by
everyone
that
the
need
was
to
give
the
regulatory
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
hydroelectric
facilities
to
assure
that
the
potential
of
the
waters
wouldn't
be
wasted
by
short-sided
development
or
by
development
at
one
point
that
wouldn't
enable
maximum
utilization
at
other
points
in
the
river
system.
and
there
were
also
concerns
that
excessive
profits
might
be
made
by
the
utilization
of
the
hydroelectric
sites
because
it
was
cheaper
to
produce
the
electric
power
by
this
method
and
there
was
also
the
possibility
of
making
excessive
profits
at
the
time
the
license
is
expired
and
the
facilities
were
converted
and
so
safeguards
replaced
in
the
law
with
respect
to
that
aspect
of
it
as
well.
and
if
you
just
side
the
highlights
from
subsequent
developments
starting
in
1921
in
its
first
annual
report
to
congress
and
repeatedly
to
the
series
of
annual
reports,
the
commission,
the
federal
power
commission
indicated
that
its
jurisdiction,
under
the
act,
not
merely
under
the
project
works
clause,
i
should
say,
but
under
the
act
was
limited
to
hydroelectric
facilities.
and
there
was
indication
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
this
when
they
reenacted
federal
water
power
act
as
the
part
one
of
the
federal
power
act
in
1935
and
that
congress
deliberately
decided
not
to
expand
commission
licensing
jurisdiction
at
that
time.
this
is
recounted
in
some
detail,
this
portion
of
the
legislative
history
on
page
8
of
the
reply
brief
filed
by
the
intervenor
companies.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
did
in
1935
as
well,
your
honor
which
is
recounted
there
and
again
in
1962,
they
sought
jurisdiction
which
is
slightly
different
from
what's
at
issue
here
but
is
basically
jurisdiction
over
the
licensing
of
plant
sites
for
thermal
power
plants
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
along
the
river
and
congress
has
not
yet
seen
fit
to
enact
this
legislation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
commission
hasn't
as
a
body
taken
the
position
out
of
that
in
the
last
few
years
although
they
are
still
very
considerable
opinion
on
the
commission
that
either
the
federal
power
commission
or
somebody
should
have
this
kind
of
authority
to
decide
on
the
siting
for
thermal-electric
plants.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
commission's
counsel
did
point
out
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
that
it
thought
that
with
respect
to
the
use
of
surplus
water
in
this
case,
there
was
no
need
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
reach
that
because
any
authorization
that
might
be
relevant
had
already
been
given
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
commission
itself
has
not
reached
that
issue.
that
was
something
that
was
supposed,
under
the
court
of
appeals
order,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
be
decided
on
remand,
that
is
correct.
so
i'm
in
an
ambivalent
position
as
the
commission's
counsel
after
taking
the
position
on
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
but
it's
not
anything
we've
presented
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
because
the
jurisdictional
question
of
clashed
union
is
what
we
thought
was
worthy
of
this
court's
review
rather
than
the
particular
situation
on
this
one
river.
there
the
jurisdictional
question
affects
a
large
number
of
existing
and
planned
power
facilities
throughout
the
country
and
that's
what
the
commission
thought
needed
resolution
in
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
quite
independent
of
the
jurisdiction
they
have
sought
and
it's
quite
different
it
its
thrust
from
the
jurisdiction
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commission
has,
under
the
surplus
water
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
much
closer
to
the
project
work's
jurisdiction
and
the
basic
motivation
for
it,
as
power
consumption
and
power
needs
are
expanding
so
rapidly
is
a
concern
on
the
part
of
the
commission
for
adequacy
and
reliability
of
power
service.
at
present,
there
is
no
agency
which
has
centralized
authority
to
consider
alternative
sites
for
new
thermal
plants
and
to
authorize
a
particular
site
to
the
exclusion
of
any
other
regulatory
jurisdiction.
as
a
result,
you
got
seriatim
litigation
about
the
siting
of
thermal
projects
which
can
result
in
considerable
delay
in
the
construction
of
needed
facilities
with
the
risk
of
brownouts
and
blackouts.
under
the
court
of
appeals'
holding,
the
commission
would
not
have
authority
in
authorizing
the
use
of
surplus
water
to
preempt
other
regulatory
agency,
state
or
federal
from
the
siting
question,
it
would
merely
be
an
additional
obstacle
that
would
have
to
be
overcome
to
the
resolution
of
where
particular
plant
that's
needed
can
be
built.
so
we
wouldn't
be
having
a
resolution
of
what
the
commission
sees
as
needed
under
the
surplus
water
clause.
i
should
turn,
since
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
with
respect
to
the
first
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
i
should
turn
to
their
holding
on
the
surplus
water
clause.
the
first
thing
to
be
said
about
it
is
that
most
of
the
legislative
history
applies
equally
to
the
surplus
water
clause
which
was
in
the
act
from
the
outset
and
which
was
included
in
the
commission's
generic
reports
that
it
lacks
a
jurisdiction
over
thermal-electric
facilities.
sometimes
the
reports
would
specify
under
part
one
of
the
federal
power
act
which
was
obviously
included
the
surplus
water
clause.
indeed,
if
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
very
compendious
history
of
that
particular
clause
which
the
intervenors
have
compiled
in
their
supplemental
brief
which
is
very
helpful
in
showing
the
antecedence
of
the
clause
which
indicate
that
it
was
tied
in
very
specifically
with
hydroelectric
development.
the
other
thing
in
our
view
may
have
mislead
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
question
is
the
fact
that
the
litigation
focused
so
much
on
section
4
(e).
in
the
appendix
in
our
brief
on
page
63,
we
have
set
forth
section
23
(b)
of
the
act
which
probably
is
the
section
of
the
complaint
should
have
been
brought
under
because
that
is
the
section
that
says
who
is
required
to
get
a
license.
section
4
(e)
simply
says
what
authority
the
commission
has
to
issue
a
license.
obviously,
the
two
have
to
be
read
together.
but
section
23
(b)
on
page
63
indicates
quite
clearly
on
the
face
of
the
act
that
there
is
very
little
warrant
for
reading
the
two
clauses
differently
since
it
says
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person,
state
or
municipality
for
the
purpose
of
developing
electric
power
to
construct
project
works
or
to
use
surplus
water.
and
it's
rather
hard
to
see
why
the
words
for
the
purpose
of
developing
electric
power
would
not
be
read
the
same
with
respect
to
both
clauses.
it's
the
operational
words
that,
in
light
of
the
legislative
background
indicate
a
limitation
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
hydroelectric
facilities.
now,
the
argument
is
made
that
under
this
reading
of
section
23
(b)
and
of
the
similar
authority
in
section
4
(e),
the
surplus
water
clause
becomes
redundant
and
superfluous
and
loses
any
function.
in
reflecting
on
this
matter
in
preparing
the
argument,
the
things
to
ask
that
the
most
apparent
function
of
the
surplus
water
clause
on
the
face
of
the
act,
again
is
reflected
in
section
23
(b)
on
which
the
litigation
did
not
focus.
and
i'm
sorry
this
point
was
not
made
in
the
briefs
but
its
there
on
the
face
of
the
act.
and
that
is
the
fact
that
section
23
(b)
has
a
grandfathering
provision
for
any
facilities
that
were
built
under
a
grant
prior
to
june
10,
1920.
that
would
by
enlarge
statutory
grants,
special
statutory
grants
for
existing
facilities.
and
the
commission
--
on
the
commission's
long
standing
position
endorsed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
a
case
called
northwest
paper
company
against
the
power
commission,
344
f.2d
47
is
that
the
grandfathering
clause
is
an
authorization
for
facilities
existing
at
that
date
to
continue
operation
without
a
license
from
the
commission
so
long
as
none
of
the
projects
works
a
replace
without
a
license
under
the
project
works
clause.
but
then
in
the
event
and
the
commission
has
not
had
occasion
to
actually
apply
this
in
the
event
the
dam
would
be
built
subsequently
upstream
from
which
surplus
water
would
flow
to
this
project,
there
would
be
commission
jurisdiction
only
under
the
surplus
water
clause
so
that
the
entire
river
system
would
be
brought
under
regulation
to
maximize
the
hydroelectric
potential
of
the
entire
system
because
obviously
the
flow
has
to
be
regulated
from
one
project
to
another
to
maximize
the
utilization
of
all
of
them.
and
similarly,
the
surplus
water
or
water
power
seems
to
us
just
to
refer
to
either
the
use
of
the
surplus
water
or
water
power
seems
to
us
just
to
refer
to
either
the
use
of
the
surplus
water
downstream
or
the
surplus
water
power
at
the
site
where
it
is
falling,
the
dam
itself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
the
--
its
consumed,
some
water
is
consumed
by
thermal
plants
and
this
is
the
basic
difference
between
the
use
of
the
water
by
thermal
plants
and
by
hydroelectric
plants
with
hydroelectric
uses
basically
a
non-consumptive
use.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
has
not
been
in
the
business
of
being
the
arbitrary
between
competing
demands
for
consumption
of
water
in
the
river
system.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
cooling
water.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
is
consumed
in
the
cooling
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
some
of
it
is
returned.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
and
some
of
it
is
consumed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
through
evaporation,
the
heating
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
my
time
has
expired.
