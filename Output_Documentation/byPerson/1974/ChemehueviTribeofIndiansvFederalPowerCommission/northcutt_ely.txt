mr.
northcutt
ely
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
northcutt
ely
they
are
all
operational
except
for
the
kaiparowits
plant
which
is
still
in
the
planning
stage,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
injunction
which
was
sought,
the
order
asked
for
in
the
federal
power
commission
was
to
halt
their
operation
or
construction
until
a
license
should
be
obtained
and
pending
the
determination
of
this
case.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
licensing
procedure
may
--
it
was
contested
as
it
would
be
here,
it
may
take
at
least
two
years
before
the
commission,
another
two
years
in
litigation
afterwards,
at
least.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
your
honor,
they're
not.
these
plants
will
develop
7,400
megawatts,
some
23%
of
the
total
power
for
19
million
people
in
the
southwestern
states.
the
alternative
use
of
the
--
have
i
answered
your
question,
sir?
the
alternative
use
of
the
250,000
acre
feet
which
will
be
consumed
by
these
plants
and
the
cooling
process
evaporation,
if
used
in
agriculture
which
the
states
of
the
colorado
river
basin
have
a
right
to
do
in
perpetuity
if
it
is
not
used
in
an
industry
here.
that
250,000
acre
feet
would
support
under
the
limit
land
limitation
laws
something
under
200
farm
families.
the
judgment
decision
rest
with
the
secretary
of
interior
and
with
the
states
as
to
whether
the
water
resources
shall
be
used
for
agriculture
or
industry,
whether
some
19
million
people
shall
be
protected
against
blackouts
and
brownouts
by
the
utilization
of
this
coal
of
indian
reservations
to
generate
power
and
to
use
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
in
the
cooling
process.
that
decision
is
entrusted
to
the
secretary
of
interior
and
the
water
is
apportioned
to
the
states
by
compacts
which
he
is
subject.
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
to
overrule
its
valued
judgment.
if
it
were
to
grant
a
surplus
water
license,
it
would
be
a
nullity
because
these
plants
have
as
the
statutes
require
for
statutes,
contracts
with
the
secretary
of
interior
for
the
use
of
the
water
from
a
government
dams
involved
here.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
this
is
understandable
that
there
would
be
confusion,
your
honor.
the
colorado
river
compact
as
you
may
recall,
apportions
in
perpetuity,
the
water
for
consumptive
use
to
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin.
the
statutes
under
which
the
dams
are
build,
hoover
dam,
glen
canyon,
navajo,
the
three
involved
here
prescribed
that
no
person
shall
have
the
right
to
the
use
of
the
stored
water
except
by
contract
with
the
secretary
of
interior
and
he
of
course
is
subject
to
the
compact
that
i
have
mentioned
on
the
other
law
of
the
river.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
the
states
prepare
plans
which
are
submitted
to
the
secretary
and
as
a
practical
matter
these
are
worked
out
in
concert.
the
statutes
as
designated
to
the
secretary
is
superseding
any
authority
the
commission
may
have
once
had
for
comprehensive
planning,
the
job
preparing
comprehensive
plans
for
utilization
to
these
water
resources,
but
in
concert
with
the
states.
mr.
northcutt
ely
precisely,
your
honor.
superseded
both
with
respect
to
the
function
of
the
surface
water
license
that
is
held
now
by
the
water
contract
with
the
secretary.
superseded
as
to
the
planning
function
of
the
commission.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
think
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
the
--
in
our
--
i
think
you're
correct.
the
project,
the
decision
on
the
project
works
clause
in
our
view
ends
this
case.
if
you
decide
that
the
steam
plant
does
indeed
constitute
project
works,
then
it
would
require
a
license.
it
would
get
us
water
by
contract
with
the
secretary
of
interior
for
cooling
but
not
for
via
surplus
water
license.
if,
however,
you
decide
that
a
steam
plant
is
not
in
the
category
of
project
works,
this
case
ends
because
the
surplus
water
clause
is
not
an
alternative
ground
for
licensing
in
this
colorado
river
case
whatever
it
maybe
elsewhere.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
--
correct,
exactly
so.
mr.
northcutt
ely
this
is
correct
in
a
sense
mr.
justice
rehnquist
if
there's
a
competing
claim
for
water
for
industry
steam
plants,
water
for
breaking
up
slug
and
a
copper
smelter
whatever
as
against
agriculture.
the
states
in
the
first
instance
would
approve
or
disapprove
this
appropriation
or
this
request
for
water.
but
neither
a
competitor
could
get
the
water
out
of
a
government
dam
without
a
contract
with
the
secretary
and
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
compact
reserves
to
the
states
apportionment
to
the
decision
how
to
use
a
water,
but
if
they
want
water
out
of
a
government
dam,
then
as
this
court
held
in
arizona
versus
california
as
you'll
recall,
the
secretary
has
a
final
part
to
say
which
user
within
each
states
will
get
water
from
that
dam
by
contract.
mr.
northcutt
ely
and
the
power
--
well,
the
congress
may
overrule
that.
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
we
think
it
has.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
this
is
correct.
the
stored
water
--
this
court
said
in
an
earlier
arizona
versus
california
case
has
in
effect
congress
has
in
effect
appropriated
the
unappropriated
surplus
water,
impounded
it
and
directed
that
no
person
may
use
it
to
save
by
contract.
this
is
with
respect
to
water
in
excess
so
that
which
has
been
appropriated
as
read.
in
any
event,
no
matter
what
--
may
i
say
that
before
i
--
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
if
i
may
for
rebuttal.
we
are
in
total
accord
with
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said
about
the
project
works
clause
and
about
the
surplus
water
clause
in
the
merits.
my
point
is
you
don't
reach
the
surplus
water
issue
if
you
decide
the
project
court
below
was
right
on
project
works
in
the
colorado.
thank
you.
mr.
northcutt
ely
your
honor,
to
disclose
first
of
some
of
the
questions
last
asked
about
salinity.
i
will
ask
your
attention
to
page
114
as
of
the
supplement
to
our
brief
which
quotes
from
the
findings
of
fact
in
a
case
called
hickory
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
114
(s)
of
the
supplement
to
the
brief.
this
quotes
from
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
in
a
case
in
which
all
of
the
complainants
here
of
parties,
except
for
two
indian
tribes.
and
it
points
out
that
the
effect
on
salinity
of
the
colorado
river
by
the
small
quantities
of
water
which
will
be
consumed
here
is
not
measurable.
mr.
northcutt
ely
oh,
it
starts
at
the
top
of
the
page
114
(s).
all
of
the
water
consumed
here
will
affect
salinity
at
the
imperial
dam,
the
lower
end
of
the
river
by
0.8
to
1.2%.
it
will
be
nearly
if
not
impossible
to
detect
these
increments
of
standard
measurements
of
chemical
water
quality.
the
quality
of
water
there
now
is
low.
it
has
869
points
permitted
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
let
me
clear
that
out
your
honor.
the
quantities
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
exactly,
the
burning
up
of
the
water
in
the
evaporating
process
and
the
cooling
towers
doesn't
add
any
salt
to
the
river.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
takes
it
out
of
the
river
and
leaves
it
in
the
evaporating
ponds
as
salt
cake.
it's
taken
out
of
the
river.
but
the
water
is
taken
out
too
and
so
there
is
less
fluid
to
dilute
the
salt
that
comes
into
the
river
downstream
from
irrigation
projects.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
i
mean
there
is
nothing
to
argue
about
and
besides,
if
we
are
really
going
to
determine
the
right
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
virtually
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
because
environmentalists
were
concerned
about
the
heating
effect
of
the
water
that
would
come
back
from
the
cooling
tower.
mr.
northcutt
ely
exactly
so.
he
just
named
as
a
contaminant
in
the
environmental
protection
act,
they
did
not
want
the
water
heated
up.
and
at
navajo,
we
spent
$5
million
to
avoid
returning
this
water
to
the
stream,
which
is
the
cheapest
thing
to
do.
our
reply
brief
points
out
that
the
cooling
water
used
in
united
states,
a
greater
part
of
it
still
is
once
through
flow,
as
it
goes
back
to
the
stream.
so
in
1971,
the
last
year
for
which
the
commission
published
data,
over
99.2%
of
the
water
diverted
for
cooling
was
returned
to
the
stream
but
heated
up.
in
some
areas,
they
don't
want
this
hot
water
and
the
pressure
is
put
on
the
power
plants
to
build
cooling
towers,
a
great
expense.
we
have
done
that.
so
this
is,
if
i
may
say
so,
a
rabbit
trail.
if
you
were
going
to
truly
litigate
quality
of
water
here,
the
right
of
a
user
in
the
lower
basin
to
complain
of
uses
by
these
five
power
plants
in
the
upper
basin.
even
though
the
five
plants
were
within
the
apportionments
made
by
the
colorado
river
compact,
you
would
have
to
have
the
states
that
are
parties
to
that
compact
here
to
respond
to
the
charge.
and
even
though
you
are
within
your
quantities,
you
are
affecting
our
quality.
you
can't
have
what
was
apportioned
to
you.
mr.
northcutt
ely
oh,
it
is
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
is
indeed.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
the
--
let
me
come
to
another
point
on
the
literal
wording
matter.
we
in
our
briefs,
we
have
traced
some
16
places
in
the
statute
where
the
language
selected
related
to
only
to
--
obviously
to
hydroelectric
projects,
totally
inappropriate
for
steam
plants.
the
definition
of
project
works,
you'd
have
to
include
references
to
ash
handling
plants,
coal,
pipelines
and
so
on.
none
of
it
is
there.
everything
is
for
hydro.
there
is
in
the
legislative
history
at
least
one
statement
by
congressman
taylor,
later
chairman
of
the
appropriations
committee,
“that
of
course
were
not
including
steam
plants
in
this
bill,
are
we?”
and
the
answer
was,
“you're
right.”
this
was
discredited
because
the
man
uttering
was
a
utility
executive
put
one
of
it.
in
1920,
when
this
act
was
passed,
virtually
all
of
the
--
the
greater
part
of
the
power
production
was
by
steam
as
it
is
now.
by
the
time
the
1935,
congress
rejected
the
commission's
request
for
authority
to
license
steam
plants.
there
are
more
than
four
times
a
capacity
that
was
in
1920.
in
1972,
when
congress
last
rejected
chairman
nassikas
request
for
this
very
authority,
capacity
of
steam
plants
are
going
by
35
times
but
it
was
in
1920.
everybody
knows
how
to
use
cooling
water.
now
the
cooling
water
that
is
used
from
the
sea
that
was
referred
here
obviously
wouldn't
be
put
to
plant
within
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
power
commission.
if
it
was
used
by
from
wells,
you
don't
get
under
the
authority
of
a
federal
water
power
act
and
consequently
the
fact
that
cooling
water
is
taken
here
from
a
navigable
stream.
it's
a
far-fetched
detour
to
say
that
this
tiny
use
of
cooling
water
somehow
four
miles
by
plant,
four
miles
from
a
stream
somehow
brings
that
by
the
intent
of
congress
into
the
scope
of
an
act
intended
to
regulate
water
power.
as
this
both
the
majority
and
minority
pointed
in
the
taum
sauk
case.
you're
dealing
with
the
federal
power
act
with
the
hydroelectric
potential
in
falling
water.
and
the
teaching
of
the
taum
sauk
case
is
it
makes
no
difference,
whether
water
comes
to
the
head
of
the
penstocks
by
nature
or
by
active
man
through
a
pump,
it's
a
falling
water.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir,
yes,
union
electric.
mr.
northcutt
ely
and
we
think
your
honor
that
that
case
controls
this.
you
cannot
reach
your
contrary
conclusion
here
on
the
licensing
of
steam
plants
without
abandoning
the
rational
of
the
majority
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
white
nor
the
minority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
joined.
there
is
a
logical
difference
between
the
two.
congress
legislated
in
one
field
but
not
the
other.
and
the
arguments
made
here
might
very
appropriately
be
made
to
congress.
opinion
might
well
differ.
the
many
parties
should
be
heard
there
who
are
not
here
in
this
court.
one
final
point,
complaint
was
made
that
in
1968,
congress
had
enact
in
the
colorado
river
project
act
placed
an
embargo
upon
the
licensing
of
projects
between
grand
canyon
dam
and
hoover
dam.
so
it
did
but
these
were
hydroelectric
projects.
the
projects
that
bridge
canyon
or
marble
canyon
that
had
been
intended
to
provide
power
for
the
central
arizona
project
and
cash
registers
to
help
finance
it
and
that
the
sierra
club
and
other
conservations
opposed
and
said,
“no,
use
thermal
power
for
this
pumping.”
whereupon
congress
put
in
to
the
1968
act
authority
for
the
secretary
to
buy
an
interest
in
the
plant
attacked
here,
the
navajo
plant
on
lake
powell
and
the
united
states
has
appropriated
some
$200
million
to
buy
a
24%
interest
in
that
plant
to
pump
water
into
the
central
arizona
aqueduct.
that
is
one
of
the
plants
that
our
opponents
now
say
that
would
have
to
be
licensed,
not
withstanding
this
act
of
congress.
as
the
four
corners
plant,
it
is
below
the
navajo
dam
on
the
san
juan.
an
act
of
congress
in
1962
said,
“not
only
that
you
must
have
a
contract
to
take
water
from
that
dam,
but
if
yours
is
a
long-term
contract,
it
must
be
validated
by
special
act
of
congress.”
consequently,
one
plant
below
the
navajo
dam
does
have
such
a
contract,
it
was
validated.
if
the
four
corners
plant
is
found
indeed
to
be
using
water
out
of
that
stream
instead
of
under
state
law
appropriations,
it
must
get
a
contract
which
must
go
to
congress
for
approval
and
the
federal
power
commission
cannot
grant
it
by
a
surplus
water
license.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
