mr.
ely,
before
you
commence,
would
you
inform
us
as
to
the
status
of
these
plants.
the
time
the
suit
was
brought.
my
understanding
is
that
two
of
them
were
operational.
unknown
speaker
an
injunction
is
sought.
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
how
long
does
it
normally
take
to
obtain
a
license?
unknown
speaker
it
hasn't
been.
unknown
speaker
well
it
--
do
you
have
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
now,
where
a
government
dam
isn't
involved,
where
there
isn't
a
surplus
water
issue,
you
would
think
that
the
--
you
would
say
that
the
secretary
of
interior
has
no
jurisdiction
either?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
i
understand
that
but
what
if
there
isn't
a
dam
involved?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
how
about
your
statement
that
there
is
no
other
--
no
government
regulation
interpose
between
the
power
company
and
the
use
of
the
water
in
the
navigable
stream?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
--
my
question
was
then,
except
in
those
specials
--
in
those
circumstances,
does
a
secretary
of
interior
have
any
power?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
now,
what
about
on
the
colorado
or
some
other
place
in
the
west
if
the
secretary
is
going
to
make
a
decision,
does
he
have
to
comply
with
the
environmental
protection
act?
unknown
speaker
well
they're
different
but
it
does
not
mean
that
the
public
has
no
participation.
unknown
speaker
how
can
this
finding
with
respect
to
the
brining
of
this
suit
in
relation
to
the
building
of
the
plants?
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
asking?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
oppose
the
granting
of
the
license?
unknown
speaker
well
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
construction
of
the
act
has
been
in
so
far
as
the
federal
power
commission
is
concerned
up
to
this
state.
unknown
speaker
and
if
somebody
applied
to
them
for
a
license,
they
would
not
give
them
a
license
because
that
we
have
no
power
to
give
a
license.
unknown
speaker
and
people
go
forward
on
that
assumption.
and
would
you
suggest
the
plant
could
then
be
required
to
get
a
license
and
then
perhaps
it
would
be
denied
and
the
plant
close
down.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
ask
but
it
was
unlikely,
i
suppose
that
was
your
contention
that
it
could
be
closed
down
without
some
kind
of
compensations.
unknown
speaker
what
is
correct?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
that
return
water
is
gone,
if
it
weren't
used
in
the
river,
i
mean
in
a
plant?
unknown
speaker
from
irrigation.
unknown
speaker
but
the
water
is
still
used
up?
unknown
speaker
114?
