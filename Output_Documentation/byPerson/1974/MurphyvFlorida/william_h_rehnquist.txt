is
fort
lauderdale
--
does
fort
lauderdale
have
a
large
newspaper
of
its
own
or
does
it
tend
to
rely
on
the
miami
newspaper?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

--
does
it
had
state

mr.
swickle,
i
notice
in
judge
atkins
opinion,
the
district
judge
in
denying
habeas
corpus
at
page
40
of
the
appendix
said,
“prior
to
his
involvement
of
the
crime
which
is
the
subject
of
this
petition,
murphy
had
focused
nationwide
attention
on
himself
for
his
role
in
the
1964
theft
at
the
star
of
india
sapphire.”
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
a
case
like
this
whether
the
publicity
coming
to
a
defendant
about
a
prior
conviction
is
involuntary
on
his
part
or
whether
he's
generated
it
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
one
--
one
reading
you
can
give
to
judge
atkins’
finding,
it
certainly
isn't
the
only
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
spite
of
the
statewide
circulation
of
the
miami
herald?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
--
did
you
raise
this
point
in
your
florida
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
your
request
for
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
they
can
--
have
been
dismissed
for
a
cause
those
three
i
take
it
since
they
didn't
--
the
time
they
were
challenged
for
cause
they
didn't
know?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
not
--
you're
not
talking
about
the
deliberation,
you're
talking
about
the
place
where
the
jury
waits
to
be
chosen?
