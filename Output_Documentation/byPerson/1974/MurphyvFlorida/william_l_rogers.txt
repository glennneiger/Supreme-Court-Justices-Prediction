mr.
william
l.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
as
has
been
stated
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
is
essentially
whether
a
state
defendant's
trial
by
a
jury
is
rendered
essentially
unfair
and
therefore
violative
of
due
process
when
members
of
that
jury
have
some
knowledge
of
the
defendant's
prior
criminal
background
and
knowledge
of
some
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
the
petitioner
asserts
this
error
at
the
level
of
constitutional
violation
on
the
basis
that
there
was
failure
to
excuse
these
jurors
of
cause
and
in
the
alternative
that
his
motions
for
a
change
in
venue
were
denied.
we
submit
that
these
issues
were
properly
decided
by
the
two
federal
courts
below
and
that
their
reasoning
should
be
dispositive
of
this
case.
i
would
submit
that
the
reasons
therefore
are
rather
extensive
and
there
is
no
precedent
that
either
of
the
lower
federal
courts
had
for
requiring
disqualification
of
a
state
juror
because
he
had
knowledge
of
the
defendant's
criminal
past.
it
would
require
the
elevation
of
this
court's
holding
in
marshall,
not
only
to
sixth
amendment
standards,
but
also
require
that
that
be
then
enforced
against
the
state
as
an
aspect
of
due
process.
no
court
has
expressly
gone
so
far.
secondly,
we
would
submit
that
on
the
question
of
a
change
in
venue,
the
petitioner
did
in
fact
receive
a
fundamentally
fair
trial
in
the
venue
in
which
the
crime
occurred
and
that
was
dade
county,
florida.
now
the
jurors
who
actually
served,
the
six
who
counsel
mentioned
just
a
few
moments
ago,
met
the
court’s
--
this
court’s
standards
for
determining
the
viability
of
these
jurors
in
irvin
versus
dowd.
the
standard
is
even
set
forth
in
florida
as
a
statute,
florida
statute
913
03,
which
requires
that
the
irvin
v.
dowd
standard
be
carried
out
in
florida
trial
courts.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
the
publicity
to
which
the
defendant
was
subjected
was
not
the
kind
of
publicity
which
the
cases
on
which
he
relies
in
the
point
two
were
actually
decided.
there
is
quite
a
disparity
between
the
degree
of
prejudice
which
was
found
in
those
or
i
should
say
the
type
of
facts
on
which
those
cases
were
based
from
which
a
determination
that
prejudice
was
inherent
and
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
is
not
the
case
that
this
record
shows.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
assert
that
there
are
qualifications
to
that
and
that
it
was
not
that
every
juror
who
is
in
the
jury
room
was
exposed
to
that.
in
fact,
as
our
brief
points
out
that
there
was
quite
a
discrepancy
between
the
jurors
who
were
examined
which
indicates
that
they
were
not
all
discussing
the
case.
some
of
them
flatly
denied
it.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
yes
your
honor,
mrs.
essie
shawd
(ph)
was
one
juror
who
disagreed
and
mrs.
patricia
asher
also
i
would
--
mr.
william
l.
rogers
mrs.
essie
shawd
is
at
page
124
of
the
appendix.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
well,
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
them.
not
all
of
the
jurors
--
not
all
of
the
other
jurors
said
they
have
been
discussing
the
case.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
no
your
honor,
the
jurors
did
not
all
--
were
not
all
asked
the
same
questions
and
therefore
they
did
not
all
say
that
they
had
been
discussing
the
case
in
the
jury
room.
some
of
them
said
that
they
had
heard
discussions
of
the
case.
one
man
who
heard
discussion
to
the
--
mr.
william
l.
rogers
that
the
jurors
discussed
the
case
before
hand?
mr.
william
l.
rogers
no
your
honor.
this
is
because
this
was
such
an
extensive
voir
dire
that
the
jurors
has
so
much
idle
time.
i
would
point
out
that
these
jurors
were
examined
in
camera.
they
were
examined
individually
rather
than
as
a
panel
which
is
a
normal
procedure.
the
reason
--
mr.
william
l.
rogers
called
in
individually.
the
jurors
were
called
in
one
by
one
and
they
were
examined
separately
on
voir
dire,
which
is
the
reason
that
there
were
so
many
jurors
who
are
waiting
and
why
the
procedure
took
so
much
time.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
no,
it
was
--
this
was
in
a
camera
proceeding.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
ah,
excuse
me,
as
to
the
--
where
the
members
of
the
public
--
this
was
not
a
sealed
proceeding
but
the
judge
did
make
sure
that
the
perspective
jurors
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
hear
the
answers
of
the
jurors
who
went
before
them.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
yes
your
honor
that's
correct
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
procedure
which
the
trial
judge
then
used
was
to
examine
these
jurors,
and
allow
counsel
to
examine
the
jurors
and
then
upon
counsel
reaching
a
tentative
agreement
as
to
whether
a
juror
would
be
selected
to
serve,
each
tentative
juror
was
personally
instructed
by
the
trial
judge
at
length
as
to
what
his
conduct
should
be
while
awaiting
trial,
as
to
what
he
should
avoid
reading,
as
to
what
influences
he
should
avoid
exposing
himself
to.
this
was
repeated
for
each
juror
and
representative.
examples
of
these
instructions
appear
at
page
928
of
the
original
transcript,
page
866
of
the
original
transcript
and
can
be
found
in
fact
after
each
of
these
jurors
appeared
and
were
selected
as
a
tentative
juror.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
publicity
since
this
is
deemed
to
be
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
issue
on
the
second
point
that
the
publicity
had
been
in
effect
at
its
hype
year-and-a-half
to
three
years
prior
to
the
trial.
in
the
period
of
six
months
proceeding,
the
trial
of
the
cause
that
the
publicity
was
found
to
be
diminishing
and
that
in
fact
there
were
very
few
articles
which
surrounded
this
trial,
the
lower
court
so
found.
so
as
far
as
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
there
was
no
infection
of
the
community
as
has
been
found
to
violate
the
requirements
of
this
court
in
irvin
versus
dowd,
in
rideau
versus
louisiana.
there
was
no
inherent
prejudice
in
the
community
thereby
leaving
no
question
whether
prejudice
must
have
infected
the
panel.
the
court
exercised
its
voir
dire
ability
to
exclude
those
jurors
from
the
panel
who
had
any
actual
prejudice.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
the
defendants
used
all
the
peremptories,
yes
your
honor
there’s
no
question
about
that.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
refused
challenges
for
cause
but
the
standard
which
the
judge
used
was
the
standard
that
this
court
laid
down
in
irvin
versus
dowd,
a
juror
who
could
reasonably
apply
himself
to
the
law
and
the
facts
and
exclude
any
extraneous
influences.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
the
full
quotation
is
enlightening
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the
passage
before
me.
mr.
william
l.
rogers
but
the
reason
that
he
said
it
was
because
he
said
that
he
had
such
a
strong
adherence
to
constitutional
safeguards
that
this
concept
made
him
sick
and
it
was
on
this
basis
that
we
submit
that
he
had
a
very
reasonable
assurance
that
he
gave
to
the
trial
judge
that
he
would
be
in
fact
a
qualified
juror
and
would
not
consider
any
extraneous
influences.
regarding
edvabsky,
i
believe
is
his
name
your
honor,
i'll
attempt
that
to
summarize
our
position
in
this
issue
there
are
few
more
details
which
i
would
to
go
into
if
i
may
return
to
the
first
point.
and
that
is
that
it's
most
significant
that
the
trial
in
this
case
involved
a
defendant
who
had
drawn
not
only
statewide,
but
nationwide
attention
to
himself
with
some
of
his
previous
exploits,
among
these,
the
highly
publicized
star
of
india
jewel
theft
from
the
new
york
museum
of
natural
history.
after
his
release
on
this
and
prior
to
the
rubbery
in
the
instant
case,
there
were
two
other
highly
significant
crimes
which
he
committed
also
in
the
state
of
florida
and
each
of
this
crimes
drew
intensive
publicity
at
that
time,
but
of
course
they
were
long
prior
to
this
trial.
the
miami
herald
which
was
--
it
is
presented
most
broadly
in
the
appendix
to
this
case
is
the
leading
paper
statewide.
in
addition
to
other
papers
which
appear
in
various
regional
parts
of
florida,
the
miami
herald
does
have
a
statewide
circulation.
now
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
to
find
the
panel
of
jurors
anywhere
within
the
state
who
as
the
result
of
the
star
of
india
and
publicity
on
the
subsequent
crimes
would
not
have
had
some
concept
that
this
events
had
transpired.
in
addition,
the
district
on
habeas
corpus
had
no
constitutional
precedent
by
which
he
could
decide
that
marshall
should
be
the
test
which
should
have
been
applied
in
the
state
courts.
marshall
would
serve
indeed
as
poor
precedent
in
a
case
such
as
the
one
at
bar.
the
requirement
that
the
states
should
be
controlled
by
marshall
would
impose
a
severe
hardship
in
a
situation
of
the
notorious
defendant
who
were
then
not
be
able
to
find,
with
the
status
i
should
say,
would
not
be
able
to
find
a
defendant
for
such
a
case
probably
anywhere
in
the
state
who
had
not
known
of
a
conviction
for
one
of
these
prior
crimes.
the
extent
of
publicity
have
reached
the
point,
let
me
point
out
here
that
there
was
even
a
movie
made
of
some
of
these
exploits
so
the
district
judge
who
was
quite
justified
in
finding
that
this
was
a
notorious
defendant
--
mr.
william
l.
rogers
yes
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
two
factors
regarding
that
change
of
venue
on
a
separate
federal
crime
that
is
that
one,
the
declaration
that
by
this
defendant
that
he
was
guilty
and
was
a
co
defendant
with
the
others
would
necessitate
that
the
federal
judge
change
the
venue
for
that
particular
crime.
and
secondly,
the
ease
with
which
the
co-defendants
obtained
the
jury
in
pensacola,
a
remote
part
of
florida,
is
easily
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
co-defendants
did
not
have
anything
like
the
notoriety
that
this
defendant
had.
so
once
we
removed
mr.
murphy
from
the
four
defendants,
then
the
other
three
defendants
can
quite
easily
get
a
jury
as
they
have
virtually
no
notoriety
in
further
fame
or
reputation.
mr.
murphy's
name
would
not
enter
into
a
jury's
consideration
whether
he
could
give
any
of
the
three
co-defendant's
a
fair
trial.
the
requirement
that
the
states
be
bound
by
the
marshall
doctrine
would
place
the
state
in
a
position
quite
different
from
the
federal
trial
courts
in
that
any
federal
trial
court
does
have
a
jurisdiction
over
a
federal
crime
and
under
rule
21,
a
federal
defendant
who
is
so
put
upon
could
succeed
in
getting
his
caused
transferred
to
the
most
remote
federal
district
court
in
this
country.
the
states
would
be
hard
pressed
to
have
the
same
flexibility
and
indeed
a
defendant
who
would
be
known
statewide
for
particular
crimes
within
that
state
could
very
well
find
himself
without
a
jury
and
there
will
be
no
possibility
of
affording
the
man
a
trial
at
all.
that
is
probably
the
strongest
reason
which
we
can
assert
that
the
more
flexible
irvin
v.
dowd
standard
is
the
one
that
is
properly
applied
to
the
states,
whereas,
the
marshall
requirement
can
continue
as
a
viable
standard
for
the
federal
judiciary.
it
is
just
such
a
situation
as
this
which
prompts
the
distinctions
between
federal
and
state
practice
and
the
distinctions
indeed
which
have
been
approved
in
spencer
versus
texas
of
there
being
--
the
possibility
of
variations
in
practice
between
the
state
and
federal
courts.
if
i
may
address
the
second
point
with
my
remaining
time,
we
did
not
have
the
situation
in
dade
county
which
would
qualify
under
any
of
the
tests
or
any
of
the
factual
patterns
in
rideau
versus
louisiana,
estes
versus
texas,
or
irvin
versus
dowd
in
which
it
was
clear
from
the
nature
of
the
case,
the
size
of
the
community,
the
intensity
and
the
viciousness
of
the
publicity
which
infected
those
small
communities
that
it
was
clear
that
we
could
have
presumed
that
any
defendant
brought
--
that
these
defendants
brought
before
any
jury
in
that
selected
from
a
venire
from
that
community
could
not
receive
a
fair
trial.
the
concept
that
too
many
jurors,
too
many
times
had
announced
their
prejudice
in
irvin
versus
dowd,
would
not
find
any
parallel
in
the
transcript
in
the
instant
case.
the
jurors
who
actually
served,
gave
quite
viable
and
quite
rational
explanations
of
their
impartiality
and
the
passage
of
time
was
not
the
least
of
this.
clearly
although
they
had
some
knowledge
prior
to
the
time
they
entered
the
courtroom
of
the
defendant’s
background
and
the
defendant's
prior
crimes,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
passage
of
time
does
dim
these
recollections.
what
made
matters
worst
as
to
some
of
these
jurors
was
that
the
manner
of
examination
on
voir
dire
refreshed
all
of
their
recollections
and
indeed
led
some
of
the
jurors
into
saying
that
i
did
not
know
that
that
was
the
fact
until
counsel
mentioned
it
during
voir
dire.
so
the
passage
of
time
certainly
had
been
the
recollection
of
these
facts
as
far
as
many
of
these
jurors
were
concerned.
the
size
of
the
community
in
dade
county
also
removes
it
from
the
inherent
prejudice
category
and
places
this
judge
as
very
reasonably
having
denied
a
motion
of
change
of
venue.
he
did
this
after
he
observed
the
demeanor
of
all
the
witnesses
on
the
stand.
he
deferred
ruling
on
this
motion
at
the
time
it
was
made
and
declared
that
he
would
not
rule
on
it
until
he
had
observed
the
panel.
so
indeed,
he
did
have
every
opportunity
for
filtering
out
any
prejudice
that
may
have
been
likened
in
the
community
and
presents
a
record
before
this
court
which
represents
a
reasonable
basis
on
which
to
say
that
the
courts
below
are
quite
correct.
now,
we
submit
that
affirmance
is
warranted
on
this
cases
because
the
petitioner
was
afforded
a
full
measure
of
due
process
as
that
has
been
defined
by
this
court
in
irvin
versus
dowd.
indeed,
the
irvin
versus
dowd
standard
has
been
adopted
by
at
least
12
states
which
have
had
occasion
to
pass
on
the
issue.
it
would
be
quite
surprising
to
most
of
the
state
courts
if
the
marshall
standard
were
now
deemed
to
be
super
imposed
and
required
after
what
appear
to
have
been
settled
precedent
in
the
area.
thank
you.
