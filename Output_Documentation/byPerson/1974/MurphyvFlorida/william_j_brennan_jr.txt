justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
the
essence
of
the
argument
really
that
marshall
ought
to
be
considered
as
a
constitutional
ruling
applicable
to
the
states
which
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
in
disagreement
with
the
third
circuit
said
it
would
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
the
whole
case
is
all
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
question
marshall
is
previous
supervisor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
said
so
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
same
conflict
because
of
--
that's
the
one
sheppard
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
irvin
and
dowd?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
we
had
made
it,
marshall
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
supervisors
are
very,
very
difficult
in
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
marshall
was
not
a
sixth
amendment
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
marshall
ruled
under
supervisor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
gather
that
you
now
argue
is
we
should
accept
the
third
circuit's
analysis
in
duncan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
known
to
you
we
haven't
said,
we
first
learned
about
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
other
members
of
the
panel
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
they
challenged
for
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
roman
two.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
come
to
--
you
don't
mean
that
all
of
the
panel
was
not
in
court?
you
mean
that
each
was
called
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
you
in
that
jury
room?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
murph
the
surf's
reputation
was
wide
open?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
murph
the
surf's
reputation
was
was
what,
a
glamor
figure
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
the
one
that
became
a
motion
picture
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
don't
know
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
none
of
those
who
actually
sat
on
the
jury
included
the
one
who
you
pointed
out
to
us
said
hang
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
is
any
of
the
--
one
of
the
jurors
who
actually
sat
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
convicted
him
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
include
the
person
who
said
hang
him
before
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
didn't
say
it?
