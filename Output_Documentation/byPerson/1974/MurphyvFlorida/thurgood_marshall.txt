[voice
overlap]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
have
we
ever
had
a
change
where
the
jurors
while
waiting
for
the
trial
all
together
had
a
trial
all
of
their
own?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
said
that
every
--
every
juror
testified
that
they'd
heard
discussions
in
that
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall

normal

i

justice

justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
juror
that
said
what
i
heard
about
this
case
made
me
vomit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner,
who
was
convicted
in
a
state
court
of
robbery,
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
denied
a
fair
trial
because
jurors
had
learned
from
news
accounts
of
his
prior
felony
convictions
or
certain
facts
about
the
robbery
charge
itself.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
jurors'
exposure
to
this
type
of
information
does
not
in
a
state
trial
presumptively
deprive
the
defendant
of
due
process.
looking
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
we
hold
that
the
jurors
did
not
display
hostility
to
petitioner,
suggesting
a
partiality
that
could
not
be
set
aside.
the
jurors
neither
betrayed
or
belief
in
the
relevance
on
petitioner's
past
through
his
present
guilt
nor
withdrawn
from
a
community
with
settlements
so
inflamed
against
petitioner
as
to
call
in
to
question
various
signs
of
impartiality.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
denying
the
writ
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result
and
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
