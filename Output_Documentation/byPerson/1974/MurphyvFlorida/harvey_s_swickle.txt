mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
issues
that
are
presented
here
for
this
court's
consideration
today,
both
dealing
with
pretrial
publicity
in
a
criminal
matter.
first
question
that
is
presented
is
whether
the
jury's
knowledge
to
the
news
media
of
a
defendant's
prior
convictions
is
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
the
jury
should
be
excused
for
cause
or
a
change
of
venue
granted,
notwithstanding
those
juror's
assurances
of
impartiality.
the
second
question
which
this
court
has
to
deal
with
is
whether
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
this
particular
case
warranted
a
change
of
venue
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
in
the
state
court.
the
pertinent
facts
with
regards
to
this
issue
are
as
follows.
on
january
8,
1968
the
defendant
was
arrested
for
the
commission
of
an
armed
robbery
in
dade
county,
miami
beach,
florida.
during
the
pretrial
proceedings
of
that
case
he
filed
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
as
well
as
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
while
this
particular
case
was
pending
in
that
case
number
and
that
first
case
was
68530,
the
defendant
was
indicted
in
the
broward
county
which
is
a
northern
county
directly
north
of
dade
county
and
charged
with
a
crime
of
first
degree
murder.
those
cases
gained
notoriety
in
the
news
in
dade
and
broward
county
and
known
as
the
whiskey
creek
murder
cases.
after
that
case,
he
was
also
indicted
in
a
federal
court
with
regards
to
transportation
of
stolen
securities
arising
out
of
the
whiskey
creek
murder
case.
so
at
one
time
or
another,
there
were
three
prosecutions
pending
against
mr.
murphy.
in
dade
county,
judge
steadman,
after
a
lengthy
hearing
found
the
defendant
incompetent
to
stand
trial.
the
defendant
was
then
committed
to
south
florida
state
hospital.
mr.
gerstein,
the
state
attorney
then
now
pros
that
case.
i
think
its
important
to
point
out
here
that
at
the
time
of
the
insanity
ruling
there
was
a
tremendous
outcry
all
the
way
up
to
the
governor’s
mansion
and
governor
clark
ordered
an
investigation
into
the
insanity
ruling
that
mr.
sherman
who
was
a
state
senator
at
the
time
and
who
is
now
the
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
florida,
initiated
an
investigation
of
judge
steadman
with
regards
to
this
particular
incident,
all
while
legal
proceedings
were
still
pending.
in
march
1,
1969,
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
of
the
murder
case
subsequent
to
the
now
prosing
of
the
dade
county
case,
mr.
murphy
was
transferred
to
broward
county,
there
were
legal
proceedings
for
almost
a
year
and
on
march
1,
he
was
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that
would
be
fort
lauderdale,
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
there
is
several
newspapers
in
fort
lauderdale.
the
fort
lauderdale
news
would
be
the
biggest.
the
substantial
amount
of
publicity
however
was
from
the
miami
herald
and
the
fort
lauderdale
news.
the
record
in
this
case
will
show
articles
from
both
of
those
newspapers
as
well
as
from
the
lesser
newspapers.
however,
the
miami
herald
is
a
prevalent
newspaper
in
fort
lauderdale
and
broward
county
and
in
throughout
the
state
in
some
instances.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir,
to
a
degree
--
to
a
lesser
degree
than
in
the
southern
counties.
five
months
after
the
defendant
was
convicted
on
the
first
degree
case,
mr.
gerstein
reinstituted
the
wofford
robbery
case
under
a
new
case
number
69-7464.
in
december
1969
prior
to
the
trial
which
was
almost
a
year
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
wofford
case,
mr.
murphy
then
entered
a
plea
in
the
federal
case
before
judge
eaton
in
miami.
prior
to
the
trial
in
the
wofford
--
the
second
wofford
robbery
information,
the
defendant
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
same
robbery
case,
new
information.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
somewhere
along
the
way.
what
had
happen
was,
when
we
got
down
to
the
trial
proceedings,
the
record
will
show
that
the
judge
went
into
the
jury
selection,
selected
the
jury
panel,
but
did
not
impanel
the
jury.
then
held
a
hearing
dealing
with
the
competency
of
the
defendant,
and
then
found
the
defendant
competent
to
stand
trial,
then
impaneled
the
jury
and
then
proceeded
with
the
trial.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
no
sir.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
this
is
the
same
judge,
judge
colin
steadman
was
the
same
judge
throughout
that
period
of
time.
the
judge
reserved
his
ruling
on
the
motion
to
change
of
venue
until
he
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
each
of
the
jurors.
the
jurors
were
examined
individually
as
opposed
to
collectively.
of
a
total
of
approximately
78
jurors,
the
record
will
show
that
20
of
these
jurors
were
excused
for
cause.
the
defendant
exhausted
his
preemptory
challenges
and
had
requested
of
the
court
additional
peremptory
challenges
which
were
denied.
in
each
instance
the
defendant
moved
to
excuse
each
juror
individually
and
that
motion
--
many
of
those
motions
were
denied
with
the
particular
reference
to
the
six
jurors
and
the
two
alternates
which
eventually
did
serve.
to
summarize
very
briefly,
the
knowledge
of
these
jurors,
all
of
the
jurors
either
knew
of
the
defendant’s
conviction
for
first
degree
murder
in
broward
county
or
for
his
somewhat
infamous
theft
of
the
star
of
india,
the
long
ruby
in
new
york
several
years
prior.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
i
believe
either
four
or
five
years
prior
to
the
trial.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
17
months
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
he
was
convicted,
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference.
now,
when
we
say
that
mr.
murphy
brought
it
upon
himself,
he
brought
on
himself
not
that
he
went
out
and
spoke
to
reporters.
what
judge
atkins
meant
there
was
that
he
was
arrested,
he
was
convicted
and
it
was
a
result
of
publicity
arising
out
of
that
case.
he
didn't
go
out
and
seek
the
publicity
just
as
he
didn't
go
out
and
seek
the
publicity
in
the
murder
case.
it
accompanied
him
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
arrested
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
theft.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
well,
except
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
if
your
honor
please,
to
support
any
other
determination.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
in
any
of
the
proceedings,
mr.
murphy
went
out
and
solicited
advertisements
or
solicited
news
articles
about
himself.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
position.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
position
that
we
take
that
the
news
followed
the
crime
and
was
done
as
a
matter
of
news
reporting
as
opposed
to
mr.
murphy
going
out
and
soliciting
magazines
and
type
of
thing.
there
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
the
name
murph
the
surf
originally
came
from
the
fact
that
he
was
to
surfer
on
miami
beach
and
did
shows.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
oh!
yes
sir,
he
likes
the
name.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
well,
this
is
the
name
that
was
attributed
to
him,
he
didn't
publish
his
name
as
murph
the
surf.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
oh,
i
won't
dispute
the
fact
that
there
was
recognition
to
some
degree.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
but
i
don't
feel
that
with
regards
to
that
recognition,
it's
something
he
went
out
and
solicited
with
regards
to
the
star
of
india.
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
question
came
up
in
the
trial
court
with
regards
to
whether
mr.
murphy
could
get
a
fair
trial
in
any
other
county
in
the
state
of
florida
and
was
pointed
out
to
the
judge
that
three
months
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
co-defendants
who
were
set
for
trial
before
judge
eaton
in
the
federal
--
in
the
state
transportation
of
stolen
securities
case,
judge
eaton
entered
an
order
of
removal.
they
went
up
to
pensacola,
selected
a
jury
in
one
day
and
concluded
the
case
and
i
believe
in
a
day-and-a-half.
now
we
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
indicating
that
although
the
publicity
was
extremely
extensive
in
dade
county
and
in
broward
county,
you
could
go
to
other
counties
in
the
state
and
obtain
a
fair
trial
as
was
done
in
the
federal
case.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
jury
selection
in
the
federal
cases
as
was
pointed
out
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
took
less
than
a
day
and
the
case
was
concluded
in
i
think
two
or
three
days,
the
actual
trial.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
the
crux
of
the
case,
yes
sir.
my
position
on
this
is
simply
if
one
--
when
you
look
at
the
case
law,
marshall
actually
was
the
first
case
that
departed
from
the
old
ruling
both
in
the
federal
and
the
state
courts
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir,
yes
sir
and
it's
been
ruled
upon
it.
there
seems
to
be
some
conflict
between
the
circuits,
the
third
circuit
and
the
ninth.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
right.
because
of
the
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
--
interpretation
of
sheppard
and
irvin
versus
dowd.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
correct
and
i
would
point
out
additionally
that
and
--
we
did
argue
this
in
the
brief
with
regards
to
the
duncan
versus
louisiana.
that
case
which
was
just
--
was
prior
to
murphy
was
a
ruling
where
in
this
court
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
entitles
each
and
every
individual
in
the
state
court
actions
to
jury
trials
in
certain
cases.
this
would
be
one
of
those
cases.
my
argument
there
would
that
murphy
is
a
subsequent
to
duncan
and
that
we
feel
that
the
sixth
amendment
on
the
duncan
now
being
applicable
to
the
state,
the
decisions
under
the
sixth
amendment
which
marshall
was,
marshall
ruled
in
a
supervisory
capacity
that
the
defendant
in
that
federal
case
was
denied
as
sixth
amendment
right.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir,
i'm
aware
of
that.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
well,
marshall
ruled
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
correct,
and
ruled
that
the
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial
as
guaranteed
to
a
federal
prisoner
under
the
sixth
amendment
was
violated
because
of
what
came
before
the
court.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
that
decision
made
it
applicable
to
the
states,
it
didn't.
but
when
you
read
duncan
and
you
read
sheppard
and
you
read
all
of
the
other
cases
that
have
come
down,
this
is
what
has
been
inferred
and
this
is
what
i
what
i
feel.
there
can
be
nothing
of
a
collateral
nature
more
prejudicial
to
a
defendant
other
than
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
he's
involved
in.
there
can
be
nothing
of
a
more
collateral
nature
which
would
be
prejudicial
to
him
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
think
it's
substantiated
by
the
subsequent
decisions
--
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court.
i
would
to
like,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
argue
some
of
the
points
that
counsel
has
raised
in
his
brief
at
this
point
since
we
heard
the
crux
of
the
matter
so
to
speak.
counsel
of
course
takes
the
contrary
position
with
regards
to
state
--
the
decision
cited
in
his
brief
with
regards
to
the
ninth
circuit
case
saying
that
the
marshall
was
not
applicable
because
of
its
supervisory
power.
but
i
think
what
we
have
to
do
is
notwithstanding
that,
we
still
have
to
look
to
what
was
these
juries
have
before
them.
to
determine
even
if
we
don't
hold
marshall
to
be
a
constitutional
question,
we
still
have
to
look
and
see
if
the
totally
of
circumstances
in
this
case
require
a
reversal
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
what
was
said
by
counsel
with
regard
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
totality
of
circumstances,
yes
sir.
a
separate
and
apart
from
the
marshall
ruling
itself.
this
is
what
we're
talking
about,
we're
talking
about
point
two.
now,
counsel
went
to
a
great
lengths
in
his
brief
to
review
of
the
jurors
statements.
he
went
to
a
great
extent
to
say
how
the
jurors
notwithstanding
their
knowledge
of
murphy's
conviction
and
notwithstanding
their
knowledge
of
the
murder
and
notwithstanding
what
they
had
read
in
the
paper
over
the
period
of
time
that
they
still
have
these
impartial
--
could
form
an
impartial
verdict
in
this
particular
case.
but
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
the
statements
of
the
jurors
and
just
very
briefly,
the
first
two
jurors
who
were
selected
in
this
particular
case,
mrs.
asher
and
mr.
collins.
now,
i'm
going
to
the
motive
and
i'm
going
to
the
nature
of
the
testimony.
each
of
them
assured
the
court
that
they
could
rule
on
this
matter
in
an
impartial
manner
and
that
the
statements
were
true
and
correct
because
they
were
under
oath,
but
i
would
point
out
just
very
briefly
that
four
perspective
jurors
who
came
before
and
who
came
after
these
particular
jurors
had
statements
somewhat
contrary
to
what
these
jurors
had
stated.
mrs.
asher
stated
at
page
101
of
the
appendix
that
she
heard
some
persons
discussing
this
case
in
the
jury
room
and
that’s
another
point
i
would
like
to
bring
out.
this
is
the
first
case
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
all
of
the
cases
that
i
have
read
where
the
judge
took
absolutely
no
precautions
during
the
jury
selection.
news
articles
were
permitted
into
the
jury
room.
news
articles
which
branded
the
defendant
as
a
hoodlum,
as
a
convicted
felon,
as
a
convicted
murderer.
each
of
the
jurors
testified
that
they
were
permitted
to
read
these
articles,
that
they
were
permitted
to
discuss
this
case
amongst
themselves
and
we
see
some
of
the
comments
of
some
of
the
jurors
who
said,
“what
was
the
consensus
of
the
opinion
of
the
jury?”
the
consensus
of
opinion
was
hang
him
he's
no
good.
now,
this
is
discussion
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
sir.
all
of
these
points
were
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
habeas
petition
and
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
have
judge
steadman
who
back
in
july
of
1968
entered
an
order
transferring
the
co-defendants,
a
removal,
a
change
of
venue
on
the
co-defendants
because
the
judge
citing
sheppard
said,
“i
did
not
take
the
necessary
precautions
to
protect
the
interests
of
these
defendants.
he
comes
to
1971,
these
two
--
when
mr.
murphy
goes
on
trial
and
mr.
murphy
now
has
assumed
a
substantial
portion
of
the
publicity
and
he
does
--
he
continues
to
do
nothing
to
protect
this
defendant.
he
allows
the
jury
to
which
is
i
have
yet
to
find
a
case,
allows
this
jury
to
openly
discuss
this
case
and
each
juror
was
asked,
were
you
given
any
cautionary
instructions
not
to
discuss
this
case?
were
you
reading
news
article
in
the
jury
room?
yes
we
were
and
in
fact
counsel
attempts
to
distinguish
the
marshall
case
by
saying,
“in
marshall,
the
news
articles
came
before
the
jury,
when
the
case
was
in
progress.
in
this
case,
if
--
when
you
check
the
appendix
and
you
check
the
jurors'
questioning,
three
of
the
jurors,
as
amazing
as
it
may
sound,
but
three
of
the
jurors
actually
did
not
know
that
mr.
murphy
was
a
convicted
felon
until
they
got
into
the
jury
room.
when
they
got
into
the
jury
room
and
they
discussed
the
case
with
the
other
jurors
and
had
read
the
news
articles,
then
they
become
aware
that
mr.
murphy
was
a
convicted
felon
for
the
first
time
and
those
witnesses
i
might
add,
two
of
which
actually
sat
on
the
case
in
chief
in
this
particular
matter.
now,
getting
back
to
the
point
of
the
juror's
actual
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
no,
at
the
time
they
were
challenged
of
cause
they
didn't
know.
while
they
were
waiting
in
the
jury
room
to
come
out
to
be
questioned
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes.
there's
a
room
where
the
jurors
wait.
there
was
a
100,
110
jurors
in
that
room,
in
a
small
room
and
they
were
openly
discussing
this
case,
and
mr.
murphy's
convictions.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yap.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that
is
correct.
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
all
the
jurors
were
challenged
for
cause,
each
and
every
juror.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
the
jurors
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
the
jurors
that
actually
served,
i'll
give
you
the
names
and
their
page
numbers.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
patricia
asher
whose
testimony
appears
on
page
100.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
she
was
the
first
juror.
the
second
juror
was
james
collins,
he
appears
on
page
118
of
the
appendix.
the
third
juror
was
david
edvabsky,
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
he
appears
on
page
137.

harvey
s.
swickle
william
essert,

louis
scagans,

daniel
ferguson,
page
158.
the
alternates
were
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
those
are
the
six
regulars.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
the
two
alternates
were
mary
jay
kane,
175,
and
jack
etridge,
page
183.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
now,
i'm
just
giving
--
i'm
just
giving
to
the
court
question.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
that's
correct.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
they
did
not
sit.
in
fact
the
last
juror,
i
think
probably
summed
up
the
total
circumstances
in
the
jury
room,
the
last
juror
who
was
selected,
i
mean
the
last
regular
juror
was
mr.
ferguson,
that's
correct,
when
he
said,
when
mr.
naigley
was
asking
the
questions
about
discussion
in
the
jury
room
and
he
said
it
made
him
sick
to
his
stomach
as
to
what
he
had
heard
in
the
jury
room.
that
the
jurors
were
saying
hang
him
he
is
guilty.
now,
this
is
mr.
etridge
who
is
the
last
regular
juror
who
notwithstanding
hearing
all
this
was
able
to
say
on
an
impartial
basis
that
he
could
render
affair
and
impartial
verdict
in
this
case.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
i
am
sorry
judge?
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
i
believe
--
yes
it
is.
it
is
because
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
i
don't
need
marshall
on
the
totality
issue
because
i
feel
that
what
occurred
in
the
jury
room
with
--
and
with
what
the
jurors
knew
of
the
defendant,
i
don't
feel
that
the
defendant
has
to
show
actual
prejudice.i
think
that
is
inherent
prejudicial
here.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
if
we
have
marshall,
we
never
have
to
reach
the
second
question.
if
your
honor
please,
i've
reserved
10
minutes
of
my
time
so
at
this
time
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes
your
honor,
just
very
briefly.
mr.
justice
marshall,
your
concern
with
regards
to
the
jurors
who
said
that
they
had
discussed
this
or
heard
discussions
in
the
jury
room
was
not
i
would
say
all
the
jurors,
this
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
bring
out.
i
would
say
70
or
60%
of
the
jurors
who
were
actually
questioned
indicated
that
there
were
discussions.
what
i
wanted
to
point
out
is
that
it
seemed
that
the
jurors
who
sat
on
the
jury
panel
were
the
ones
who
didn't
hear
any
discussions
and
the
ones
that
were
excused
for
various
reasons
either
for
cause
or
for
medical
reasons
or
excused
by
the
state
or
excused
by
the
defendant,
those
jurors
seem
to
have
a
different
view
of
what
transpired.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
give
you
a
quick
rundown.
patricia
asher
who
was
the
first
juror
who
said
she
had
heard
one
person
discussing
the
case
and
then
one
person
had
formed
an
opinion.
the
immediate
two
jurors
after
her,
frank
kell
and
art
fleming,
mr.
kell
said
the
majority
of
the
perspective
jurors
had
formed
an
opinion
that
the
defendant
was
guilty,
that's
at
page
108.
mr.
fleming
who
came
immediately
after
mr.
kell
said,
the
juror
discussing
the
case
stated
put
him
away,
throw
away
the
key,
there
was
a
consensus
of
--
that
was
the
consensus
of
the
opinions.
the
next
juror
who
sat
was
mr.
collins.
mr.
collins
who
was
able
to
sit
and
then
impartially
listen
to
this
case
said,
“no
one
in
the
jury
room
had
formed
an
opinion
of
this
case.”
however,
the
jurors
both
before
him
and
after
him
are
referring
to
again
mr.
fleming
and
mr.
pererro,
mr.
pererro
says,
“discussions
about
murphy,
there
were
discussions
about
his
prior
convictions
and
the
jurors
had
formed
an
opinion
of
guilt.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
no,
i
am
suggesting
on
the
talking
about
motive
and
the
jurors
testimony,
we
seem
to
have
a
situation
where
the
jurors,
some
of
the
jurors
who
sat
in
this
case,
who
sat
in
the
jury
room
for
three
days
came
out
and
said
they
heard
no
discussion
of
this
case.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
no
sir.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
the
discussions
of
the
--
from
all
of
these
jurors
with
anybody
sitting
in
that
room
would
have
heard
discussions
regarding
this
case
judge
--
your
honor
and
i
say
that
--
i
say
that
because
unfortunately
i
was
there
so
i
know.
now
i
would
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
no
sir
it
doesn't,
but
the
record
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
well,
it
also
point
out
that
the
record
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
i
--
no
sir,
i
was
there
at
the
trial,
now,
i
wasn't
in
the
jury
room.
i'd
also
point
out
judge
--
if
your
honors
please
that
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
i'm
sorry?
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
originally,
he
was
a
surfer
and
he
gained
notoriety
as
a
surfer,
as
a
concert
violinist
and
then
the
first
criminal
activity
which
the
notoriety
was
gained
was
--
excuse
me,
the
star
of
india.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
eventually,
yes.
not
until
long
after
this,
these
proceedings
were
over.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
there
were
some
jurors
who
said
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
there
were
jurors
who
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
if
your
honor
please,
the
jurors
when
you
and
if
you
--
i'm
sure
your
honors
have
read
the
appendix
would
indicate
that
some
of
these
jurors
when
asked
questions
by
mr.
negle
said,
they
would
have
trouble
reaching
a
verdict
in
this
without
considering
his
prior
convictions.
yet,
when
questioned
by
the
state
and
questioned
by
the
court
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
on
this
particular
charge,
the
only
one
who
indicated
something
to
that
effect
with
mrs.
scogens
at
page
149
and
150.
she
said
she
would
be
influenced
in
her
verdict
by
all
the
publicity
but
she
had
no
fixed
opinion.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
no
one
said
they
had
a
fixed
opinion.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
had
a
fixed
opinion,
none
of
them
did.
none
of
them
said
they
had
a
fixed
opinion.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
yes.
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
he
is
the
one
who
said
that
the
jurors
had
been
discussing
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
--
and
the
discussion
said
--
mr.
harvey
s.
swickle
no,
he
didn't
say
it.
that
was
the
consensus
of
opinion
of
the
jurors.
thank
you.
