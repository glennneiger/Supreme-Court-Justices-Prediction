mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
consolidated
appeals
which
present
fundamental
issues
basic
to
the
aid
for
dependent
children's
program.
broadly
stated,
the
issue
is
kind
of
parent
or
caretaker
relative
refused
to
cooperate
and
state
efforts
to
obtain
support
for
a
child
from
its
father
where
that
child
is
receiving
afdc
benefits.
and
the
further
question
is,
can
that
parent
still
claim
benefits
as
a
parent
or
relative
upon
her
refusal
to
so
cooperate.
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
starting
with
doe
against
shapiro
of
connecticut
federal
district
court
case
in
1969
have
consistency
held
that
where
a
mother
and
child
had
been
denied
assistance
by
states
or
the
mother's
failure
to
cooperate,
assistance
may
not
be
terminated
to
the
mother
and
child.
this
court
in
three
summary
affirmances
affirmed
to
the
principle
enunciated
in
doe
against
shapiro,
that
early
case.
these
are
doe
against
swank,
meyers
against
juras,
and
taylor
against
martin.
of
course
the
summary
affirmances
didn't
deal
explicitly
with
anything,
they
were
just
that
and
i
didn't
mean
to
convey
anything
else.
state
attempts
to
discontinue
grants
of
the
mother
only
were
invalidated
by
federal
courts
in
connecticut
in
doe
against
harder,
the
successor
to
doe
against
shapiro
in
which
the
state
of
connecticut
had
amended
its
regulation
to
cutoff
benefits
to
the
mother
only.
commissioner
hardy
was
held
in
contempt.
he
appealed
to
this
court
but
pending
appeal
he
was
purged
of
contempt
by
changing
the
regulation
and
this
court
had
dismissed
that
appeal
for
one
of
jurisdiction.
it
had
dismissed
that
the
appeal
in
doe
against
shapiro,
the
earlier
case
for
late
docketing
with
two
justices
dissenting.
also,
other
courts
in
pennsylvania,
iowa,
and
new
york
have
followed
the
lead
of
the
harder
court
and
held
that
assistance
may
not
be
denied
to
the
mother
for
her
failure
to
cooperate
in
stayed
efforts
to
establish
paternity
or
to
secure
a
support
for
her
child.
the
result
of
these
decisions
halting
state
efforts
to
terminate
the
grant
of
the
mother
for
her
failure
to
cooperate
has
been
that
the
state
has
been
unable
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
that
the
intent
of
congress
to
require
such
parental
cooperation
has
been
frustrated
that
the
afdc
system
has
been
turned
upside
down,
putting
the
mother
in
the
driver
seat
rather
than
the
state
agency.
the
people
who
should
contribute
to
afdc
support
thereby
reducing
need
are
not
contributing.
and
that
the
ancient
duty
of
parents
to
support
their
children
has
been
shifted
to
the
states
and
to
the
local
social
services
districts
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
now,
new
york's
interest
in
this
litigation
and
that
of
its
social
services
district
is
legitimate
and
substantial.
the
place
of
residence
of
afdc
fathers
in
new
york
state
is
unknown
to
the
caseworker.
it
is
believed
in
something
over
50%
of
the
cases.
it
is
anticipated
that
the
state
locals
and
the
local
shares
combined
for
fiscal
year
1974
under
the
matching
formula,
for
afdc,
will
amount
to
something
more
than
$700
million
in
new
york
state.
and
we
submit
that
the
state
should
have
every
opportunity
to
reduce
what
is
becoming
a
staggering
cause
and
has
been
has
been
staggering
cause
for
a
number
of
years
by
pursuing
every
avenue
open
to
them
to
require
these
fathers
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
their
children.
now,
as
originally
instituted,
this
case
involved
claims
of
the
mothers
that
the
county
agency
had
required
them
to
cooperate
in
instituting
and
prosecuting
non-support
proceedings
under
a
state
departmental
regulation
requiring
that
they
furnish
pertinent
information
in
the
location
and
prosecution
of
a
deserting
or
abandoning
parent,
that
the
non-cooperative
parent
was
ineligible
for
public
assistance.
but
that
the
grants
for
her
children
were
continued.
it
was
only
the
mother
who
was
discontinued.
while
an
appeal
was
pending
to
this
court
from
the
order
of
the
--
on
the
original
hearing
which
declared
the
state
regulation
violative
of
the
social
security
act
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
parents
or
relatives
to
institute
and
prosecute
nonsupport
actions.
new
york
social
services
law,
section
101-a
was
amended
to
insert
therein
a
new
subdivision
2
and
3.
now,
these
require
that
a
recipient
of
public
assistance,
it's
not
limited
in
its
application,
only
to
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
it's
a
statute
of
general
application,
but
obviously
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
the
statute
requires
that
a
recipient
of
public
assistance
cooperate
with
a
social
services
official
in
obtaining
support
or
support
contributions
from
the
other
parent
by
furnishing
of
the
social
services
official
with
appropriate
information
including
the
location
of
the
other
parent
or
spouse.
by
filing
a
petition
and
furnishing
evidence
in
a
proceeding
for
paternity
and
support
or
for
nonsupport.
but
if
the
applicant
fails
to
file
the
petition,
nothing
happens
except
that
the
social
services
official
is
required
to
do
so.
then,
if
the
applicant
fails
to
furnish
evidence
necessary
to
support
a
petition
for
paternity
and
support
or
for
nonsupport
in
a
marital
situation
or
if
the
person
fails
to
furnish
information
relative
to
the
location
of
the
other
parent,
her
maintenance
can
be
discontinued
for
her
willful
failure
to
do
so,
so
long
as
she
fails
to
assist
and
cooperate
as
required
by
the
statute
and
only
so
long
as
she
fails
to
assist
and
cooperate.
the
children's
grant
continues.
now,
because
of
the
amendment
to
social
services
law,
section
101-a,
this
court
remanded
for
further
consideration.
and
after
remand,
the
original
plaintiff's
below
moved
to
reconvene
the
three-judge
court
to
amend
the
complaint
and
for
intervention
by
an
unwed
mother.
there
had
been
no
unwed
mothers
in
the
case
before
that
time.
the
three-judge
court
permitted
intervention
and
amendment
of
the
complaint.
the
amended
complaint
however,
dealt
only
with
the
claim
of
the
intervener,
unwed
mother
who
had
refused
to
tell
a
social
services
official
where
the
known
father
of
one
of
her
children
was
within
a
geographical
area.
they
knew
who
he
was.
she
had
told
them
that
but
she
just
said,
“i
won't
tell
you
where
he
is
in
this
town
in
western
new
york.”
and
the
amended
complaint,
i
have
to
talk
about
this
just
for
a
moment,
did
not
state
a
claim
for
the
original
plaintiffs.
and
since
the
court
had
remanded,
we
were
not
frankly
sure
whether
this
court
would
still
consider
the
original
plaintiffs
to
be
viable
appellees
on
this
appeal.
in
any
event,
it
appears
that
the
intervener
is
an
automatic
appellee
here
and
counsel
is
quite
correctly
included
her
in
the
title
of
his
papers
as
an
intervener
appellee.
but
we
did
not
amend
the
title
of
the
action
because
the
court
below
didn't
and
we
--
this
is
a
matter
which
we
must
leave
entirely
to
the
court
of
course.
the
three-judge
court
after
the
remand
in
its
memorandum
decision
and
order
declared
section
101-a
as
amended
of
the
new
york
social
services
law
void,
unenforceable
and
without
effect
insofar
as
it
makes
recipient
cooperation
in
a
paternity
or
support
action
against
an
absent
parent,
a
condition
of
eligibility
in
afdc.
and
the
court
below
enjoined
the
defendants
in
that
case,
the
state
and
county
officers
from
terminating
assistance
to
the
intervener
or
her
minor
children
for
failure
to
cooperate
in
obtaining
support.
the
order
on
its
second
argument
did
not
act
upon
the
original
plaintiffs
at
all.
now,
if
the
original
plaintiffs
for
whom
those
claim
was
stated
in
the
amended
complaint
which
was
actually
an
intervener's
complaint
we
plead,
deemed
by
the
court
to
still
be
in
the
case,
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
afdc,
a
parent
or
caretaker
must
assist
or
cooperate
in
a
nonsupport
proceeding
instituted
by
a
social
services
official.
as
to
the
intervener,
the
question
presented
is
whether
she
may
be
required
to
furnish
the
location
of
the
father
of
one
of
her
children
to
the
social
services
official.
and
as
i
say,
prior
to
the
intervention
of
this
unwed
mother,
we
had
no
paternity
aspect
to
this
case
whatsoever.
but
as
it
stands
before
the
court
now,
it
has
both
nonsupport
and
paternity
support
aspects
depending
upon
the
court's
construction
of
its
own
remand.
now,
we
contend
that
the
new
york
statue
furthers
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act,
simple
as
that.
the
appellees
contend
that
the
statute
creates
a
condition
of
eligibility
not
provided
for
in
the
social
security
act.
and
so
that,
we
answer
we
don't
think
it
does.
but
even
if
it
does,
the
social
security
act
not
only
allows
for
state
efforts
to
abstain
support
and
establish
paternity
but
require
such
action.
and
that
the
statute
is
within
the
legitimate
sphere
of
state
administration
and
is
necessary
to
the
proper
administration
of
the
afdc
program.
the
state
statute
does
not
violate
any
specific
provision
of
the
social
security
act
or
rather
as
friendly
too
and
furthers
the
provisions
of
the
act.
this
court
discussed
the
statutes,
the
provisions
in
the
social
security
act
that
are
involved
on
this
appeal
and
its
decision
in
king
against
smith
when
it
was
in
connection
of
course
with
the
alabama
man-in-the-house-rule.
the
court
set
out
these
statutes,
federal
statutes
to
which
i'll
allude
in
a
moment,
and
said,
the
pattern
--
this
is
a
392
u.s.
332,
the
pattern
of
this
legislation
could
not
be
clearer.
every
effort
is
to
be
made
to
locate
and
secure
support
payments
from
persons
legally
obligated
to
support
a
deserted
child.
and
later
on
in
the
same
page,
the
provision
seeks
to
secure
parental
support
in
lieu
of
afdc
support
for
dependent
children.
that
is
exactly
what
new
york
is
trying
to
do.
new

social
services

101-a,

and

provisions
of

of

it

of

section
402
(a)
(17)
requires
--
i'm
reading
from
page
46
of
my
appellant
brief,
the
appendix,
that
a
state
plan
must
provide
for
the
development
and
implementation
of
a
program
under
which
the
state
agency
will
undertake
one,
in
the
case
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
who
is
receiving
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
to
establish
the
paternity
of
such
child
and
secures
support
from
him.
and
two,
in

case
of
any
child
receiving
such
aid
who
has
been
deserted
or
abandoned
by
his
parent
to
secure

for

from

from

liable
for
such
support
utilizing
any

code.
agreements

with
other
states
to
obtain
and/or
enforce
court
orders
for

and
section

(7)
provides
that
the
state
in
determining

shall
take
into
consideration
any
other
income
and
resources
of

or
relative
claiming

now,
subsequent
in
--
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
no.
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
that
sir.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
that's
right.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
i
think
we'd
have
a
difficult
time
establishing
that.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
we've
run
it.
perhaps
we
--
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
at
least
for
the
child.
the
child
is
not
really
involved
and
of
course
the
statute
says,
“in
the
case
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
who
is
receiving
assistance.”
so,
i
wouldn't
care
to
speculate
if
your
honor
will
permit.
i
assume
--
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
this
court
in
dubino
and
in
townsend
against
swank
laid
down
various
ground
rules,
if
the
statute
is
within
the
legitimate
sphere
of
state
administration
as
long
as
it
doesn't
conflict
with
any
substantial
provision
of
the
social
security
act,
the
state's
provision
is
all
right.
if
it
doesn't
--
and
that
isn't
that
basically
it
mr.
justice
white?
this
is
an
area
where
the
statute
expressly
provides
that
a
state
shall
have
a
program
for
determining
the
paternity
of
children
in
getting
their
support.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
absolutely.
its
--
we'd
say
we're
authorized
to
do
it
and
we're
required
to
do
it.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
it's
--
so
long
that
same
general
line
of
reasoning
that
that
a
person
as
this
court
said
in
wyman
against
james,
a
person
should
not
be
able
to
get
adc
on
her
own
informational
terms.
and
that
i
think
is
what
we're
talking
about,
this
woman
--
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
the
home
visitation,
yes
sir.
and
that
i
think
is
where
we're
at.
the
statute
provides
that
we
have
to
have
this
program
for
developing
and
implementing
a
program
to
get
this
support
and
to
establish
paternity.
and
the
woman
--
what
happens
is
the
woman
balks
and
won't
give
you
the
information.
now,
she
is
the
only
one
who
has
this
information
and
certainly
in
paternity
cases,
it's
very
difficult
to
establish
paternity
by
any
testimony
other
than
a
woman
by
any
evidence
or
the
more
that
she
might
give.
and
it's
very
difficult
if
the
father
has
runoff
as
it
has
happened
in
so
many
adc
cases
to
locate
--
to
obtain
support
unless
the
mother
will
cooperate
new
efforts
to
do
so.
and
this
--
it
seems
to
us
is
the
same
type
of
situation
as
it
--
we
--
as
the
court
run
into
in
wyman
against
james.
and
wyman
against
james
has
been
troubled
many
courts
because
it
went
on
constitutional
ground.
it
went
on
the
fourth
amendment
grounds.
there
have
been
a
substantial
number
of
cases
in
this
area
of
nonsupport.
and
wyman
against
james
went
on
constitutional
grounds
and
it
wasn't
until
the
court's
decision
in
dublino
that
the
court
said
that
that
type
of
activity
was
within
a
legitimate
sphere
of
state
administration
and
had
the
courts
known
--
the
lower
federal
courts
known
at
the
time
that
they
were
deciding
this
case,
that
the
court
was
ready
to
say
that
in
dublino.
perhaps,
the
decisions
would
be
wrong.
we're
in
a
difficult
situation.
we
come
in
here
with
a
--
status
in
the
case
law
based
upon
this
doe
against
shapiro
concept,
that
this
court
has
never
been
adopted
--
has
never
adopted
that
the
only
conditions
of
eligibility
or
need
in
dependency.
we
come
in
with
a
series
of
cases
where
the
judges
have
been
troubled
by
wyman
against
james
by
the
court's
holding.
and
the
--
judge
claire
in
doe
against
shapiro
was
troubled
by
it.
he
thought
it
was
square
authority
for
discontinuance
of
the
mother
and
the
child.
and
judge
markowitz,
i
think
in
doe
against
swank
was
troubled
with
it.
and
judge
mitchum
in
zayas
v.
hernandez,
the
only
case
of
the
federal
level
that
i
know
of
that
went
with
us
it
was
troubled
by.
and
that
case
was
vacated
and
remanded
on
appeal
because
the
appellate
court
held
there
should
be
a
three-judge
court
and
on
remand
they
followed
this
court's
affirmances
in
taylor
against
martin,
myers
against
juras
and
alike.
and
they
held
the
states
couldn't
do
it.
and
this
has
been
a
constant
source
in
the
new
york
case
of
lascaris
v.
wyman
in
67
miscellaneous,
a
very
early
case
involving
a
completely
different
factual
situation.
the
court
held
that
doe
--
disagreed
with
doe
against
shapiro
and
followed
the
teaching
of
wyman
against
james
that
this
type
of
activity
was
permissible.
and
the
only
other
case
that
i
know
of
that
i
haven't
cited
because
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it,
it's
the
state
of
washington
case
cited
in
paragraph
1240
of
the
commerce
clearing
house
poverty,
the
reports,
a
superior
court
case
in
king's
county,
doe
against
smith
back
in
1970
which
was
on
our
side
of
defense.
and
we
--
but
our
point
is
sir,
that
the
statute
is
clear,
that
the
states
have
to
do
something
about
this
problem
of
illegitimacy
and
about
this
problem
of
nonsupport.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
it's
estimated
that
the
state
department
of
social
service
estimates
that
its
--
that
the
cost
--
i
have
to
say
that
the
afdc
program
is
not
budgeted
in
the
new
york
state
budget
as
a
separate
public
assistant
items.
new
york
is
--
other
public
assistance
program
and
there's
a
total
budget
for
the
program
as
i
understand
it.
but
the
department
estimates
that
the
cost
to
the
state
of
new
york
during
fiscal
year
1974
and
75
will
be
$358
million.
now,
the
cost
of
that
is
doubled
because
the
local
shares
are
equal
to
the
state
shares.
so,
the
counties
and
the
cities
pay
another
$358
million.
it's
an
awful
lot
of
money.
and
new
york
is
--
back
in
1972
added
this
section
101-a
to
attempt
--
to
plead
that
the
memorandum
and
support
of
it,
its
attached
to
the
appendix
b
of
my
brief
and
on
the
premise
that
federal
law
permitted
it,
permitted
this
type
of
action.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
oh,
i
don't
know
if
i
can
answer
that.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
there
has
been
iowa
--
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
101-a,
all
that
i
know
about
is
connecticut,
pennsylvania,
iowa,
new
york
and
there
was
a
recent
case
out
in
utah,
rose
against
pampton
(ph)
i
believe
in
june
of
1974
which
i
just
found
the
other
day.
and
those
are
the
only
ones
i
know
about.
and
rose
against
pampton
has
followed
the
teaching
of
the
shirley
court,
we
can
do
this.
and
we
take
the
--
we
believe
that
the
social
security
act
specifically
gives
us
authority
to
do
it.
now,
the
federal
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
has
filed
a
regulation
supporting
our
right
to
do
these
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
that
was
done
pendente
lite
after
the
first
--
after
the
court's
remand.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
no.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
let
me
say
this.
ore
--
i
believe
that
oregon
filed
in
objection.
of
course
there
was
proposed
rule
making
as
in
every
case
and
a
notice.
and
the
state
of
new
york
filed
objections.
iowa
filed
objections
and
i
believe
oregon
filed
objections,
maybe
california.
as
to
what
happened
up
in
--
there've
been
representations
in
the
briefs
that
we
requested
this.
i
don't
think
i
have
any
right
to
talk
about
that
because
i
wasn't
purveyed
to
those
conversations.
of
course
the
states
deal
with
the
administrators
all
the
time.
and
i
wouldn't
--
i
think
that's
an
unfortunate
characterization
in
counsel's
brief.
but
i
don't
think
i
could
comment
on
it.
have
i
answered
your
question
sir?
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
now,
the
federal
stat
--
we
think
the
federal
statutes
and
regulations
and
the
state
statute,
a
recognition
of
the
basic
and
primary
duty
of
the
parent's
duty
to
support
his
child.
and
we
think
what's
wrong
with
the
whole
picture
is
that
when
you
don't
give
recognition
to
that
duty,
it
turns
the
situation
around.
so,
that
the
state
is
required
to
support
the
child
and
determine
its
support
when
the
parent
should
be
doing.
so,
we
don't
think
that
congress
has
ever
expressed
an
intent
that
this
should
happen.
and
we
think
that
the
statute
itself
is
evidenced
that
the
intent
was
that
to
a
contrary.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
the
regulation
--
i
don't
know
when
that
was
adopted.
the
statute
was
adopted
in
1972.
it
was
enacted
in
72,
the
one
that
we're
upon
now.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
it
would
have
been
sometime
after
1970
your
honor.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
i
do
not
--
it
was
in
a
state
regulation
but
i
do
not
believe
there
was
any
provision
in
the
state
regulation
to
impose
such
a
condition
prior
to
lascaris
against
wyman
in
67
miscellaneous.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
hew
have
taken
the
position
that
--
had
spoken
to
the
provisions
of
402
(a)
(11),
the
noleo
requirement,
the
notice
to
law
enforcement
offices
requirement.
and
it
had
taken
the
position
there
that
it
advise
the
states
against
establishing
support
requiring
cooperation
as
a
condition
because
of
the
wording
of
the
statute
that
a
child
has
received
adc
but
it
did
not.
i
believe
its
part
of
8149
of
the
handbook.
it
did
not
say,
“you
can't
do
it,”
it
just
advised
against
it.
but
i
should
mention
that
these
provisions
were
held
in
the
doe
against
shapiro
to
have
been
superseded
by
the
provisions
of
602
(a)
--
402
(a)
(17)
enacted
in
the
1917.
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
secretary
had
spoken
to
that
provision
prior
to
--
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
his
--
amendment
of
his
regulation.
there
had
been
two
regulations,
part
220
i
believe,
point
48
relating
to
the
establishment
of
paternity
which
was
recently
revised
in
july
of
1974
in
the
federal
register.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
yes.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
yes,
he
did.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
no,
i
don't
believe
they
have.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
other
than
in
there,
we
found
the
jurisdictional
question.
i
haven't
seen
anything
from
them.
now,
--
and
by
the
way,
i
should
tell
the
court
that
the
provisions
of
the
state
law,
i'm
relating
to
the
noleo
provision,
602
(a)
(11)
--
402
(a)
(11),
i
have
found
in
social
services
law
111,
352,
and
325
(a)
and
372
(a)
also
have
some
involvement
as
to
part
347
of
the
state
department
of
regulations.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
well,
in
that
case
i
think
i'll
have
to
stop
and
just
say
to
the
court
that
we
don't
think
that
a
statute
was
ever
intended
to
enable
this
woman
to
come
in
on
her
own
terms
and
get
assistance,
that
she
has
a
duty
to
help
us
determine
the
resources,
the
congress
has
always
spoken
in
terms
of
support
as
a
resources
in
our
brief.
and
there's
only
one
other
word
that
i
want
to
throw
out
as
i
was
reading
my
brief
last
night,
talking
about
the
legislative
history
of
602
(a)
(17).
i've
found
i
was
reading
about
two
separate
but
very
similar
bills
that
were
before
the
congress
and
i
hadn't
realized
that.
and
i
want
the
court
to
know
that.
thank
you.
i'll
reserve
if
i
may.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
i'll
just
say
your
honor
that
(inaudible)
carried
an
item
that
the
committee
on
finance
had
approved
a
new
bill
on
this
subject
of
hr31-53,
which
had
been
in
conference.
i
do
not
know
where
it's
going.
i
haven't
that
time
to
check
it,
but
i
give
that
to
the
court.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
wyman
against
james
and
carlson
against
walgamuth
(ph)where
the
court
approved
situations
where
the
grant
--
the
entire
family
was
cut
off
of
favor
to
give
a
lien
or
cooperate.
giving
the
--
a
grant
to
the
mother
in
1950
did
not
intended
to
accomplish
an
equitable
result.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
that's
when
she
was
included.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
oh,
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
they
haven't.
we've
been
under
a
stay
--
oh,
the
intervener
counsel
will
have
to
tell
you
if
the
county
has
paid
her,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
but
we
have
been
under
a
stay
for
a
class
action
in
this
case
in
this
--
in
the
--
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
i
don't
know.
we
have
to
see
that
sir
and
check
it.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
because
there
was
pending
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
i
believe
a
case
before
judge
brieant,
louis
against
lavine
where
there
was
a
class
action
order
made.
mr.
alan
w.
rubenstein
we're
under
stay
in
another
case.
