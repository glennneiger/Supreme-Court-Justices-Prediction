justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
--
could
new
york
disqualify
the
child
for
this
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
your
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it
did,
could
it
--
would
that
pass
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
--
wouldn't
you
run
into
the
cases,
let's
say
that
a
state
can't
establish
any
additional
qualifications?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
for
the
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
handle
the
cases?
let's
say
the
states
may
not
establish
additional
requirements
for
eligibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
saying
that
the
condition
of
the
state
law
is
either
expressly
or
impliedly
found
in
the
social
security
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
with
this
study
you
are
following?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
prior
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn't
impose
this
condition
prior
to
1970
or
72?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
--
was
this
state
condition
or
policy
contrary
to
hew
regulations
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
hew
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
amendment
of
his
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
under
the
new
regulations,
new
york's
regulation
is
permissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
the
district
judge
held
it
and
i
guess
it
was
held,
wasn't
it,
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
i
have
nothing
here
from
hew,
from
the
government
except
urging
us
to
take
the
case
at
the
time
when
the
appeals
were
filed.
not
--
they
haven't
given
us
anything
else,
have
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
haven't
addressed
this
holding,
that
the
amendment
was
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
1095.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
its
parent,
for
the
parent?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
for
the
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
justice
brennan's
question,
let's
assume
this
regulation
is
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
is
--
let's
assume
that's
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
issue
here
then
would
be
decided
against
it,
the
statutory
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
problem
--
i
know
but
if
that's
an
exception.
but
assuming
that
regulation
is
valid,
the
statutory
issue
would
be
the
decided
against
you,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
the
case
does
post
the
validity
of
this
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
squarely.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did
--
and
that
was
when
they
did
add
the
requirement
that
the
states
have
a
special
unit
to
pursue
the
support
obligations
of
parents?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
required
the
states
to
have
that
kind
of
a
scheme?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
was
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
they
held
that
there
was
nothing
comparable
to
the
win
edition
of
a
condition
of
eligibility
in
regard
to
noleo?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
expect
though
we'll
have
to
look
at
both
the
statute
in
the
legislative
history
under
the
townsend-swank
case.
and
determine
for
ourselves
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
relevant
is
that
hr1
and
this
senate
report,
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
law.
