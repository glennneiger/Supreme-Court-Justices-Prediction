chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
73-1016,
lascaris
against
shirley
and
73-1095,
lavine
against
shirley,
consolidated.
mr.
rubenstein,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
comparable
to
a
state
provision
that
if
employment
is
offered,
which
does
not
interfere
with
a
child
care,
that
the
mother
must
take
the
employment
in
order
to
continue
her
benefits,
not
the
child's
benefits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
one
why
she
refused
the
interview?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
its
700
and
some
million
dollars
a
year
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're'
now
using
whatever
time
--
you
may
wonder
as
reserved
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
eldridge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
all
relate
to
taking
the
support
away
from
the
mother
or
the
child?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
cases
were
not
the
same
issue
as
we
got
presented
here
though,
were
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
--
that
would
also
be
true
in
the
case
where
the
mother
was
cut
off
for
refusing
to
allow
visitation,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
referring
to
the
general
problem
which
wyman
v.
james
is
just
one
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
policy
position
of
the
department
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
a
little
difficult
to
maintain
that
kind
of
litigation
without
the
cooperation
of
the
mother,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we're
not
concerned
in
this
case,
are
we
with
cases
--
situations
where
they
cooperate.
we're
only
concerned
with
--
one
where
they
do
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
existence
of
that
statute
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
didn't
have
the
power
previously?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
recently
passed
to
clarify
ambiguous
situations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
she
being
offered
a
--
in
this
case,
isn't
she
offered
a
financial
incentive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
possible
that
congress
is
now
considering
action
in
order
to
force
recalcitrant
states
and
administrators
to
take
steps,
may
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
make
it
a
condition
of
the
grant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
isn't
quite
a
different
thing
to
make
it
a
condition
of
a
grant
by
the
federal
government
to
the
state
so
that
the
matching
grant
and
the
states
making
it
a
condition
to
the
non-cooperating
parent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
quite
different
things.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah,
that's
right.
so,
that
the
reason
for
passing
the
legislation
or
if
they
do
pass
it
or
considering
it
is
really
doesn't
have
very
much
relevance
it
seems
to
me
to
what
new
york
is
doing
with
reference
to
the
non-cooperating
mothers
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
are
other
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
cases
which
hold
that
if
it
isn't
forbidden
and
there's
a
reasonable
regulation,
it's
permissible,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
if
congress
passes
this
pending
legislation
that
you've
been
talking
about
there
probably
would
be
a
question
raised
by
someone,
sometime
rather
it
is
permissible
for
congress
to
attach
a
condition
to
its
grant
of
$358
million
annually
to
the
state
of
new
york,
that
they've
pursue
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
is
reasonable
then
there
--
then
perhaps
there
is
no
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
--
i
thought
you
would
--
eventually
conceded
its
reasonableness
in
terms
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
categorical
grant
by
the
federal
government
to
the
state.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
invalidated,
by
three-judge
courts
or
by
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
eldridge.
i
think
you
have
used
your
time
--
no,
you
have
about
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
--
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
disposition
of
73-1016,
lascaris
against
shirley
and
73-1095,
lavine
against
shirley
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
