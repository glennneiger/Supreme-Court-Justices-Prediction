mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
there
are
two
hew
regulations
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
coexist
at
this
point.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
this
latest
regulation
which
is
233.90
(b)
(4)
i
believe.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
page
28
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
lavine
case.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
purports
to
allow
a
state
to
exclude
a
mother
if
she
fails
to
cooperate
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
they
coexist
with
that
regulation,
in
other
regulation
of
hew,
233.90,
is
that
it?
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
okay.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
235.70
which
still
exist.
that's
referred
to
in
my
brief
at
--
in
my
brief
at
page
two
and
page
21.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
fully
set
out
there
however.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
let's
see.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
page
3,
is
that
--?
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
of
the
jurisdiction?
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
yes.
that
is
the
change
of
235.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
all
right.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
nonetheless,
there
still
exist
235.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
which
says
that
it
is
not
legal.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
well,
i
submit
to
you
that
hew
in
promulgating
this
regulation
did
so
without
the
authority
of
the
congress.
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
the
first
regulation.
perhaps
we
can
deal
within
subject
matter
terms.
it
said
that
you
cannot
cutoff
a
parent
or
a
child.
it
is
not
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
afdc.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
has
been
the
view
of
hew
since
1951
when
this
amendment
first
started.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
there
was
no
condition
of
eligibility
ever
in
a
regulation
of
hew
until
1973.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct.
now,
this
amendment
came
sua
sponte
from
the
hew
segment.
it
did
not
come
from
any
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
the
latest
amendment.
the
1973
amendment
which
purported
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
is
233.90
before.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
233.90
purported
to
allow
a
condition
of
eligibility.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
for
the
parent
only.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
not
for
the
child.
but
it
did
so
without
any
congressional
encouragement
to
do
that.
there
had
been
no
legislation
past.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
believe
that's
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
they
have
authority
only
if
they
comport
with
the
intentions
of
congress.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
as
expressed
in
the
statutes
and
in
this
--
in
the
social
security
act,
there
is
an
extensive
scheme,
the
noleo
scheme
set
out
to
achieve
support
for
afdc
children
and
parents.
but
in
that
scheme,
there
is
no
condition
of
eligibility.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
the
amendment
--
the
one
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
then
there
is
a
constitutional
question
that
an
equal
protection
problem
--
it
has
not
been
dealt
with
in
any
of
these
cases
here
before
because
of
the
court's
teachings.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
don't
believe
there
is
support
in
the
statute
to
decide
it
against
me.
if
you
decided
that
the
regulation
was
proper
that
it
reflected
the
intent
of
congress
then
you
could
carve
an
exception
to
the
townsend
versus
swank
approach
that
need
independency
or
the
conditions
of
eligibility
because
you
would
have
found
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
the
statutory
issue
would
then
--
what
would
remain
would
be
the
constitutional
issue
with
the
equal
protection.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
yes,
it
does.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
yes,
it
does.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
the
district
court
said
that
the
amendment
was
not
a
guide
post
to
be
followed
judicially,
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
yes.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
believe
it
is,
yes.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct.
and
that
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
well,
the
--
they
were
invited
by
this
court
to
speak
to
the
issue
they
presented
on
brief.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
can't
explain
their
absence
mr.
justice
brennan.
as
we
concede
though
that
the
law
has
been
settled.
there
are
20
federal
district
courts
that
have
decided
on
this
statutory
ground.
there
are
three
affirmances
of
this
court.
i
think
to
paraphrase
justice
brandeis
not
only
as
the
law
is
settled
that
is
settled
direct
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
they
initially
--
oh,
actually
each
one
of
them
varied.
they
were
different
ambiances
to
each
one.
i
think
the
issue
is
really
the
same.
i
think
the
distinction
between
taking
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
well,
in
the
three
affirmances
of
this
court
in
meyers
v.
juras,
the
mother
was
--
i
believe
cut
off.
the
mother
and
the
children
were
terminated
in
meyers
versus
juras.
in
taylor
versus
martin,
the
child
was
ineligible.
in
doe
versus
swank,
the
mother
was
terminated.
so,
they
vary.
now,
they
did
not
cut
the
mother
in
doe
versus
swank.
they
cut
the
child
in
doe
versus
swank.
they
cut
the
child
in
doe
versus
swank
because
the
grandmother
would
not
sue
her
daughter
for
nonsupport.
the
daughter
was
the
mother
of
the
child
but
the
grandmother
was
the
caretaker
for
her.
so,
we
moved
around
in
circles
of
consanguinity
here.
i
would
submit
though
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
distinction
between
terminating
a
mother
and
the
child
is
really
a
schmierer.
what
you
have
is
a
result
of
cutting
anyone
member
of
the
unit
as
a
net
reduction
in
welfare.
the
mother
is
by
the
--
by
terms
of
the
afdc
statute,
a
caretaker
in
order
for
her
to
continue
to
take
care
if
she
has
to
maintain
herself.
in
other
words,
she
has
to
eat
and
she
has
to
have
a
bed.
and
that
money
has
to
come
from
somewhere.
and
it
is
a
ruse
i
think
really
to
say
that
you
have
only
cut
her
off
when
you
have
deprived
the
family
of
four
of
one
quarter
of
their
income.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
visitation,
are
you
referring
to
wyman
versus
james?
well,
i'd
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
is
a
very
real
aspect
of
the
problems
presented
by
wyman
versus
james.
on
the
other
hand,
wyman
versus
james
was
decided
by
this
court
before
it
affirmed
townsend
versus
swank,
meyers
versus
juras,
and
--
not
townsend
versus
swank,
doe
versus
swank,
meyers
versus
juras,
and
carlson
versus
taylor.
i
think
that
wyman
versus
james
is
a
constitutional
case.
i
don't
think
that
it
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
whether
there
may
be
a
condition
of
eligibility
outside
the
social
security
act.
i
think
in
fact,
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
that
this
was
countenance
within
the
social
security
act.
but
the
noleo
scheme
does
not
countenance
the
condition
of
eligibility.
there
is
an
extensive
section
of
the
social
security
act
starting
in
602
(a)
(7),
it
goes
through
section
11
where
the
state
is
required
to
report
a
grant
of
assistance
to
families
with
abandoning
parents
to
local
law
enforcement
officers.
that's
the
way
it
supposed
to
go.
the
report
is
supposed
to
go
to
the
local
law
enforcement
officers.
the
state
is
required
to
develop
a
program
in
section
17
to
establish
paternity
and
to
secure
a
support
and
that
is
not
something
that
we
grow
with,
we
agree
with
the
desirability
of
securing
support.
or
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
notice
to
law
enforcement
officers.
the
state
is
required
to
develop
this
program
but
it
does
not
say
that
it
is
required
or
even
allowed
to
establish
a
condition
of
eligible.
it
is
suppose
to
establish
a
single
unit
in
the
state
responsible
for
administering
this
program.
section
18
says,
admonishes
the
states
to
cooperate,
the
state
department
and
social
services
cooperate
with
the
courts
and
law
enforcement
officials
even
to
the
point
of
entering
into
some
sort
of
financial
arrangement
with
the
law
enforcement
officials.
section
21
requires
reporting
to
hew
quarterly,
the
name,
social
security
number,
the
last
known
address
of
abandoning
parents
with
outstanding
orders
against
them
who
were
not
paying.
this
allowed
the
use
of
the
social
security
records
to
pursue
these
abandoning
spouses,
of
fugitive
fathers.
section
610
of
the
social
security
act
has
irs
tracing
abandoning
relatives.
section
22
under
602
(a)
requires
cooperation
with
other
states
in
locating
the
parents
and
enforcing
new
orders.
but
throughout
all
of
that,
there
is
no
discussion
of
a
condition
of
eligibility.
and
from
the
--
in
very
inception
hew
has
said
that
it
was
not
a
condition
of
eligibility.
i
refer
you
to
the
third
section
of
my
brief
which
deals
with
that
extensively.
but
i
think
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
think
it
was
policy
position
which
was
a
lens
to
the
congressional
intent.
i
think
they
were
following
what
congress
had
indicated
because
they
talked
there
mr.
chief
justice
in
terms
of
social
work
acknowledging
that
this
is
a
difficult
time
for
a
family
when
a
spouse
has
abandoned.
and
they
talked
about
the
need
to
counsel
mothers
with
abandoned
children
during
such
a
stressful
time
in
order
to
achieve
what
is
best
for
the
family.
it
may
not
be
immediately
best
to
sue
an
abandoning
spouse.
the
effect
of
time
often
helps
to
heal
these
conditions.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
a
father
who
is
acknowledged
to
be
the
father
of
the
child,
a
natural
father,
wed
or
unwed
has
the
obligation
to
support
his
child
until
21.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct.
a
natural
father
has
the
obligation
to
support
his
children.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
proceeding
maybe
brought
by
the
commissioner
of
social
services
for
any
county.
it
never
was
until
this
litigation
began.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
it
may
be,
but
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
--
but
by
and
large
mr.
chief
justice,
people
cooperate.
we
have
an
amicus
here
from
california
who
ran
the
figures
through.
in
california,
the
department
of
social
services
because
they
have
not
followed
previous
orders
of
the
court
are
now
required
to
tell
recipients
specifically
that
they
do
not
have
to
cooperate
in
this
proceeding.
and
yet,
in
california,
50%
of
all
the
applicants
for
welfare
do
cooperate.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
but
the
point
--
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
by
and
large
people
do
cooperate
and
67%
of
some
counties
in
california,
people
do
go
along
with
us.
most
people
do
go
along
with
it
and
i
submit
the
people
that
refuse,
refuse
for
legitimate
reasons.
if
we
take
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
jane
doe
refused
to
institute
a
paternity
proceeding
because
she
had
already
instituted
a
paternity
proceeding.
she
instituted
one
in
the
fall
of
1971
when
she
applied
for
welfare.
in
december
of
1971,
the
welfare
department
said,
“you
have
to
sue
again.”
she
said,
“i
already
did.”
they
said,
“we're
not
going
to
give
your
daughter
in
this
case
any
public
assistance
until
you
sue.”
they
refused.
they
denied
her
public
assistance
until
she
brought
another
action
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
was
a
previous
action
existent
in
the
family
court
in
onondaga
county.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
the
federal
regulation?
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
no.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
is
exactly
correct.
in
dublino
in
19
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
in
1967,
there
were
two
amendments
up
for
consideration.
one
was
amendments
to
the
noleo
section
which
added
four
or
five
of
the
sections
that
i
had
adverted
to
in
the
noleo
scheme
and
the
win
program.
in
win,
they
specifically
said
there
shall
be
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
non-cooperation
in
the
win
program.
in
the
noleo
section,
they
specifically
left
it
out.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
is
exactly
right
but
they
did
not
say
that
that
scheme
could
encompass
a
condition
of
eligibility
and
there
had
been
since
1951
a
scheme
which
did
not
include
conditions
of
eligibility.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
believe
that
that's
why
they
granted
no
credence
to
the
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
that's
why
dublino
is
not
dispositive
or
is
really
relevant
to
this
case.
dublino
dealt
with
a
specific
allowance
of
a
condition
of
eligibility,
the
work
groups.
the
win
program.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
test
that
should
be
supplied
here.
the
third
section
of
my
brief
indicates
that
the
last
brief
i
received
from
the
appellant
deals
with
what
he
calls
legislative
history.
it
deals
with
the
bill
that's
in
the
house
in
a
conference.
now,
i
don't
really
think
that
that's
fair
to
judge,
but
that
bill
does
specify
a
condition
of
eligibility.
it
says
in
the
senate
report
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
this
is
a
bill
that
passed
the
senate,
passed
the
house
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
hr
3153.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
it
has
been
battled
up
in
conference
since
1972.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
1972
in
october
it
passed
the
senate
in
1972,
november
it
passed
the
house.
it
has
been
in
conference
since
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
its
1973,
i'm
sorry.
did
i
say
1972?
1973.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
think
it
is
dead
really.
but
it
did
specifically
set
a
condition
of
eligibility.
and
the
senate
report
to
accompany
that.
the
report
says
at
page
49
of
the
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
no,
this
is
something
that
we've
just
adverted
to
by
my
opponent
in
his
last
brief.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
yes.
its
senate
report
93553
to
accompany
hr
3153.
at
page
49,
it
said
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
553.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
it
says,
“the
committee
built,
would
make
cooperation
in
identifying
the
absent
parent
a
condition
of
afdc
eligibility.”
it
didn't
say
it
would
reaffirm
a
condition
of
eligibility.
it
didn't
say
it
would
make
the
condition
of
eligibility
clearer.
it
says
that
they
would
make
a
condition
of
eligibility.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
would
submit
in
this
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
the
--
throughout
the
legislative
history,
they
do
not
talk
about
the
ambiguity
of
the
situation,
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
states
are
not
pursuing
the
remedies
under
the
situation
and
they
say
that
more
--
that
stronger
legislation
is
required.
that's
exactly
what
they
say
in
this
report.
and
they
say
however,
the
committee
feels
that
maybe
desirable
to
offer
a
mother
a
financial
incentive
to
cooperate.
now,
there
you
have
congress
talking
about
giving
a
financial
incentive
to
cooperate.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
they
draw
a
distinction
there.
they
say
that
you
may
keep
as
the
win
program
does,
as
the
work
rules
do.
you
may
keep
a
greater
portion
of
the
support
payment
that
you
received.
right
now,
in
new
york
if
you
get
a
support
payment,
the
same
amount
is
subtracted
from
your
regular
welfare
balance.
so,
people
who
receive
support
and
people
who
are
receiving
straight
a,
b,
c
without
any
support
are
at
the
same
level.
there
is
no
financial
incentive
to
pursue
the
support.
congress,
i
think
has
been
very
concerned
throughout
the
history
of
the
noleo
question
as
to
the
level
of
effort
being
put
in
by
the
state.
again,
in
the
senate
report
to
accompany
the
hr
3153
at
page
40,
they
say
and
i
quote,
“the
enforcement
of
child
support
obligations
is
not
an
area
of
jurisprudence,
about
which
this
country
can
be
proud.”
they
refer
to
the
thousands
of
un-served
and
unsupported
warrants.
they
say
the
blame
must
be
shared
by
judges,
prosecutors,
and
welfare
officials
alike.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
certainly,
this
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
certainly,
this
was
what
was
under
consideration
in
3153,
as
you
say
though,
3153
is
probably
dead
as
of
friday
on
congress
adjourns.
they
have
been
considering
it
and
i
would
submit
that
this
is
a
matter
for
congressional
consideration.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
those
are
quite
different
things.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
one
requires
the
state
to
act,
the
other
requires
the
parent
to
act.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
think
it
has
relevance
and
that
it
indicates
that
congress
had
never
countenance
what
new
york
is
doing
to
non-cooperating
relatives
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
as
a
condition
of
eligibility.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
exactly
the
test
that
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
it
starts
in
king
versus
smith
that
goes
in
townsend
v.
swank
and
it
is
reaffirmed
in
carlson
versus
(inaudible),
all
of
which
were
unanimous
opinions
to
this
court.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that's
the
doctrine
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
well,
under
dublino,
there
was
a
discussion
of
what
a
reasonable
regulation
might
be.
they
said
that
if
there
was
a
conflict
of
substance,
its
footnote
34
i
believe
in
dubrino.
if
there
was
a
conflict
of
substance
between
the
social
security
act
and
the
administrative
regulation
then,
obviously
this
supremacy
cause
operated
and
the
federal
statute
was
supreme
and
the
administrative
regulation
could
not
exist.
i
think
anytime
you
have
a
condition
of
eligibility,
that
is
a
substantial
conflict.
a
condition
of
eligibility
not
set
forth
as
need
and
dependency
or
within
the
legislative
history
of
the
social
security
act
and
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
i
would
say
that
this
is
outside
the
legitimate
sphere
of
administration.
this
goes
beyond;
this
gets
to
the
heart
of
who
can
get
afdc.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
but
that's
been
the
nature
of
categorical
grants
from
their
inception.
perhaps
revenue
sharing
has
changed
the
--
so
that
the
approach
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
may
be.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
the
reasonableness
of
what?
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
there
are
lots
of
ways
to
examine
the
reasonableness
in
the
instance
of
federal
revenue
sharing
at
this
point.
they
aren't
as
reasonable
as
the
categorical
grants
because
there
is
less
money
in
them
for
the
states.
i
really
--
i'm
not
supporting
that
at
this
point
in
this
case.
i
think
what
we
really
have
to
talk
to
is
statutory
conflict
here.
congress
has
been
very
upset
as
i
was
saying,
about
the
state's
efforts
in
this
area.
they
say
in
the
bill
--
in
the
senate
report
to
accompany
hr1
which
is
namely
2-1230.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
it's
really
not
good
legislative
history
because
its
not
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
its
not
legislation
that
ultimately
passed,
but
they
were
upset
--
they
are
again
about
the
failure
of
the
states
to
pursue
support.
the
latest
gao
survey
indicated
that
72%
of
people
who
had
support
orders
against
them
entered
by
a
court
or
who
would
agree
to
pay
support,
72%
of
those
parents
were
not
in
substantial
compliance
with
the
orders.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
the
problem.
but
the
problem
is
--
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
tried
to
say
that
in
a
family
court
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
the
response
i
have
is
that
i
do
not
see
a
turnip
standing
near
in
front
of
me
mr.
eldridge.
i
see
a
man
and
he's
capable
of
going
to
work.
well
certainly
it's
true
in
many
cases,
poor
people
don't
have
any
money,
or
they
don't
have
enough
money
to
pay
a
support
payment.
all
right,
there
are
people
in
the
other
hand
who
do
have
an
ability
to
pay
and
certainly
they
should
be
pursued
and
then
made
to
pay
their
statutory
obligation.
i
think
that
it
may
even
go
beyond
the
statutory
obligation.
the
reason
that
the
states
i
submit
are
so
anxious
and
we
have
heard
here
from
california,
iowa,
as
well
as
new
york,
there
were
19
other
states.
one
of
the
justices
asked
the
question,
“how
many
states
had
rules
like
this?”
there
have
been
19
other
states
who
had
rules
that
were
knocked
down.
i
think
the
rest
of
the
states
are
waiting
for
your
action
today
to
determine
whether
they're
going
to
continue
to
enforce
the
rules.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i'm
sure
that
not
all
of
them
do.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
i
don't
know.
it
has
been
a
very
prevalent
practice
of
late.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
19
separate
states.
there
have
been
several
regulations
in
several
states
and
new
york
for
instance
in
1969,
there
was
a
regulation
that
was
withdrawn.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
yes,
they
were
all
three-judge
courts
with
the
exception
of
one
that
judge
gurfein
in
the
southern
district
throughout
because
he
was
going
to
do
it
on
the
statutory
basis.
he
felt
no
need
to
convene
three-judges.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
yes,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
douglas
a.
eldridge
that
must
be
accurate
for
that
time,
but
over
the
past
since
1969
when
doe
v.
shapiro
was
brought,
there
have
been
19
states
that
have
--
had
their
regulations
thrown
out
by
federal
district
courts.
three
states
having
their
regulations
thrown
out
by
this
court.
and
i
submit
that
they
were
all
the
same
essential
regulation,
they
required
an
illegal
condition
of
eligibility
for
afdc.
thank
you
your
honors.
