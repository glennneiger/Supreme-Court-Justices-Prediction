justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
eldridge,
this
might
be
premature
but
i
hope
that
some
point
in
your
argument
you
may
say
something
about
whether
if
this
hew
amendment
were
valid
or
whether
you
have
any
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
thinking
of
the
one
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap),
these
numbers
get
me
all
confused.
233.90
is
the
one
that
was
adopted
on
may
3,
1973,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
may
be
denied
for
the
uncooperative
care
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
this
amendment
was
an
amendment
to
233.90?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
original
233.90.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

amendment,
it
wasn't
in
that
regulation,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
until
this
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1973
amendment.
the
b
4
that
we've
just
referred
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
expect
it
does
although
the
government
is
not
represented
here
in
light
of
the
holding
of
the
district
court
that
the
amendment
was
invalid.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it
went
beyond
that.
it
said,
“its
--
absolutely
the
department's
new
interpretations
certainly
may
not
be
terms
subtle
or
consistent
nor
may
it
be
said
that
the
agency
was
never
of
a
contrary
opinion.”
and
it
goes
on
and
says,
“the
broken
line
of
court
decisions
construing
these
provisions
in
the
absence
of
any
congressional
corrective
action
persuade
us
that
the
agency's
new
interpretation
is
an
error
and
not
a
guide
post
to
be
followed
seriously.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
a
holding
that
it's
invalid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it's
not
a
--
well,
it
affects
--
as
the
statute
does
not
otherwise
permit
a
condition
of
eligibility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
have
to
reach
it
although
the
government
is
not
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
--
all
they
did
was
say
we
ought
to
hear
the
case.
they
didn't
came
in
on
--
they
never
came
in
on
the
merits.
at
least
i
have
nothing
here
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
noleo
mean,
notice
to
the
office
of
the
local
enforcement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
eldridge,
if
this
be
a
convenient
time
for
you
to
summarize
new
york
law
with
respect
to
the
obligation
of
a
father
to
support
his
children
whether
wed
or
unwed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
wed
or
unwed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
once
he's
identified
as
the
father
and
there
is
a
proceeding
for
identifying
him
as
the
father,
i.e.
a
paternity
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
a
pending
bill
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
though?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
it
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
(voice
overlap)
--
the
house
of
senate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
unless
it
comes
out
today,
it'll
laps,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
unless
it
comes
out
today
i
gather,
it
will
relapse,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
reply
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
condition
of
eligibility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
under
townsend-swank,
you
suggest
as
the
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
can't
find
either
in
the
legislation,
in
the
act
itself
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
they
did
intend
to
authorized
the
states
to
attach
this
condition
of
eligibility.
townsend-swank
says
the
states
can't
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case,
a
three-judge
district
court
in
new
york
held
invalid
a
new
york
statute
that
required
the
recipient
of
welfare
benefits
to
cooperate
in
a
paternity
or
support
action
against
an
absent
parent
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
benefits
under
the
program
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
the
ground
of
the
decision
was
that
the
new
york
statute
was
in
conflict
with
the
eligibility
requirements
of
the
federal
statute.
since
that
case
was
decided
below,
congress
has
amended
the
federal
statute
effective
the
coming
july
which
now
makes
ineligible
for
benefits
any
recipient
who
refuses
to
cooperate
to
compel
the
absent
parent
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
the
child.
therefore,
although
we
agree
with
the
three-judge
court
that
the
new
york
statute
was
invalid
for
the
reason
given
by
the
three-judge
court
and
therefore
affirm
its
judgment.
in
light
of
the
new
statute
we
have
no
occasion
to
prepare
an
extended
opinion.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
dissented.
