ms.
nancy
stearns
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
actually
part
of
a
long
line
of
cases
which
begins
with
marbury
versus
madison,
moves
on
to
powell
versus
mccormack
and
only
this
past
summer
includes
united
states
versus
nixon.
in
the
most
recent
of
those
cases,
the
chief
justice
speaking
for
the
court
reaffirmed
that
it's
emphatically
the
province
and
the
duty
of
the
judicial
department
to
say
what
the
law
is.
here,
we
have
the
same
kind
of
problem.
we
have
a
subcommittee
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
seeking
to
evade
judicial
scrutiny
for
its
acts
just
as
the
congress
of
the
--
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
united
states
had
in
powell
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
in
united
states
versus
nixon.
at
issue
here
is
a
double
attempt
to
evade
judicial
scrutiny.
ms.
nancy
stearns
i
would
suggest
there
are
at
least
two
distinctions,
one
of
course
is
the
fact
that
the
records
here
are
first
amendment
material.
another
however
is
the
subpoena
has
to
be
scrutinized.
is
it
in
fact
a
constitutional
subpoena.
are
its
limits
appropriate
constitutional
limits?
our
problem
here
is
the
subpoena
that
was
issued
has
no
group,
no
judicial
authority
scrutinizing
whether
or
not,
in
fact
that
subpoena
is
constitutional.
certain
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
in
this
particular
case?
well,
we
of
course
argued
that
there
would
have
been
that
power
but
there
were
two
problems.
number
one,
the
subpoena
was
not
initially
served
on
the
real
party
it
interest,
the
party
whose
rights
were
at
stake
and
that
was
one
of
the
forms
of
an
attempt
to
evade
judicial
scrutiny
rather
the
subpoena
was
served
on
the
bank.
a
stake
holder
who
could
not
be
expected
to
brave
the
whole
question
of
contempt
and
raise
the
constitutional
rights
of
its
depositors,
that
was
the
first
problem.
the
second
problem
of
course
is
amongst
the
various
defenses
the
committee
is
raising
is
the
question
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
if
they
were
correct,
then
the
court
couldn't
narrow
because
the
court
couldn't
look
at
the
subpoena.
we
of
course
argue
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
does
not
in
any
way
prevent
a
federal
court
from
looking
at
a
congressional
committee,
scrutinizing
it
and
considering
and
determining
whether
or
not
its
constitutional
but
both
of
those
attempts
were
made
by
the
subcommittee
to
evade
judicial
scrutiny.
the
two
reasons
that
we
feel
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
not
appropriate
and
in
fact
cannot
prohibit
the
kind
of
judicial
scrutiny
that
we
request
and
feel
is
appropriate,
first
is
because
the
speech
and
debate
clause
is
inapplicable
to
actions
for
declaratory
injunctive
relief.
secondly,
because
the
very
subject
matter
at
issue
are
congressional
committee
subpoena
is
not
the
kind
of
subject
matter
that
is
barred
from
judicial
review
by
that
clause.
ms.
nancy
stearns
well,
let
me
start
by
suggesting
that
there
has
never
been
a
case
that
i
have
seen
that
has
in
fact
held
that
and
if
we
look
to
the
most
recent
opinions
of
this
court,
we
see
very,
very
sharp
distinction
made.
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
written
by
mr.
justice
white
in
the
gravel
case,
one
looks
very
closely
and
sees
that
although
damages
are
prohibited
against
a
house
of
representative
member
or
a
senator
that
the
actual
actions
are
not
necessarily
barred
from
scrutiny.
therefore
for
example,
although
the
writ
issued
--
excuse
me,
the
authorizing
resolution
in
kilbourn
versus
thompson
could
not
lead
to
a
damage
action
against
the
house
of
representative's
members
that
voted
for
it.
the
writ
itself
could
in
fact
be
scrutinized.
i
think
that's
a
distinction
that
was
drawn
quite
carefully
in
the
gravel
case.
ms.
nancy
stearns
i
think
that
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
there
are
several
things
that
had
been
said.
one
is
that
they
shouldn't
be
in
a
position
of
fearing
the
burdens
of
litigation
or
fearing
the
possibilities
of
liability
either
civil
or
criminal.
here
we
would
suggest
there
is
no
such
fear.
if
you
talk
because
of
course
there
is
no
personal
liability.
if
you
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
the
reality
your
honor
is
that
in
this
kind
of
a
declaratory
and
injunctive
action,
in
fact
normally
the
government
represents
the
committee
as
it
did
in
the
two
courts
below
just
as
the
government
is
involved
in
defending
the
constitutionality
of
that
committee's
subpoena
if
there's
a
criminal
contempt
case
that
arises
out
of
it,
its
no
different.
ms.
nancy
stearns
your
honor,
i
would
some
how
doubt
that
they
would
even
consider
violating
an
order
of
a
court
so
that
the
problem
of
contempt
is
not
a
realistic
one
at
least
i
would
certainly
hope
not
but
the
one
thing
i'd
like
to
suggest
is
that
if
this
is
a
very,
very
narrow
case.
ms.
nancy
stearns
we
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
why,
i
think
its
part
of
the
answer.
another
part
of
the
answer
however
is
that
in
reality
we're
not
talking
about
every
congressional
committee
subpoena,
first
amendment
or
otherwise.
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
very,
very
narrow
range
of
cases.
those
range
--
those
cases
with
the
party
who's
constitutional
issues
are
at
stake
cannot
himself
raise
them
because
the
subpoena
has
been
served
on
the
third
party.
in
all
other
instances
and
this
of
course
will
bring
me
to
my
next
argument,
in
all
of
the
other
instances,
the
constitutional
questions
that
underlie
the
action
are
able
to
scrutinized.
they
are
able
to
be
scrutinized
in
a
criminal
contempt
situation.
here
however
we
have
this
one
narrow
range.
ms.
nancy
stearns
we
haven't
--
of
course
we
haven't
waited
your
honor
because
we
in
fact
can't
wait.
if
we
had
been
the
parties
who's
receiving
the
subpoena,
we
would
in
fact
have
appeared.
we
would
have
in
fact
raised
our
constitutional
rights.
we
may
or
may
not
have
been
held
in
contempt.
here
however,
we
did
not
receive
the
subpoena
and
i
think
that
that's
probably
brings
us
to
the
most
basic
issue
in
this
case
for
we
would
argue
that
this
is
not
really
not
a
speech
and
debate
clause
case.
for
in
fact
the
constitutionality
of
subpoenas
is
scrutinized
by
the
courts
all
the
time
in
these
criminal
contempt
situations.
this
really
is
a
question
of
separation
of
powers
and
when
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
other
courts
of
appeals
in
parallel
kinds
of
cases
said,
"how
to
avoid
unnecessarily
infringing
on
the
rights
of
a
coordinate
branch
of
government."
ms.
nancy
stearns
what
we
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
what
we
would
suggest
your
honor
is
that
the
situation
isn't
quite
that
different
at
all
and
that
in
fact
implicit
in
the
subpoena
is
the
obvious
possibility
that
what
will
follow
is
the
executive
branch
and
the
judicial
branch
becoming
involved
and
using
the
full
weight
of
the
government
against
the
party
upon
whom
the
subpoena
has
been
served.
but
here
is
the
one
example
where
you
can't
expect
the
subpoenaed
party
to
raise
all
this
constitutional
rights.
because
the
subpoenaed
party
is
an
uninterested,
disinterested
third
party
here,
a
bank.
and
therefore,
in
this
one
very,
very
narrow
range
of
cases,
you
must
in
fact
weighing
all
this
matters
and
particularly
weighing
the
fact
that
there's
a
first
amendment
right
involved
permit
that
party
whose
constitutional
rights
are
at
stake
to
come
in
and
have
the
constitutionality
of
the
subpoena
scrutinized.
we
are
not
and
i
repeat
asking
for
any
damages
against
the
committee
members.
we
are
not
asking
for
any
prosecution
of
the
committee
members.
in
fact,
as
judge
tuttle
pointed
out
below,
even
an
injunction
is
not
necessary,
similarly
in
powell
versus
mccormick,
this
court
concluded
that
an
injunction
was
not
necessary
because
certainly
a
coordinate
branch
of
the
government
would
obey,
would
honor
the
ruling
of
this
court.
so,
all
we're
really
asking
for
here
is
the
court
to
look
at
this
subpoena,
its
no
different,
we
would
suggest
than
the
writ
under
which
mr.
kilbourn
was
arrested,
it
is
effectively,
exactly
the
same
thing
to
look
at
that
writ,
to
look
at
that
subpoena
and
determine
whether
or
not
its
constitutional.
and
if
it
is
not
constitutional,
why
then
declare
unconstitutional
and
a
declaratory
judgment
and
we
would
certainly
expect
and
how
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
well
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
frankly
prior
to
gravel,
i
would
have
assumed
that
there
was
some
sort
of
difference
between
staff
members
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
but
now
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
the
senator
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
and
the
reason
i
think
so
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
as
the
staff
member
would
be.
he
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
there
is
a
distinction
between
questioning
him
personally,
questioning
his
motivations
and
issuing
a
declaratory
judgment
saying
that
the
subpoena
he
issued
and
had
authorized
and
had
enforced,
had
served
is
unconstitutional.
that
the
ruling
of
that
--
this
court
in
that
instance
would
not
be
questioning
his
motivations.
ms.
nancy
stearns
in
this
instance
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment,
perhaps
the
fourth
and
other
amendments
but
certainly
as
judge
tuttle
held
under
the
first
amendment.
i
think
that
the
important
question
and
hear
words
are
very,
very
sensitive.
i
think
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
saying
that
we're
questioning
a
senator
and
saying
that
his
action,
the
subpoena
he
issued
is
unconstitutional
between
asking
for
liability
either
civil
or
criminal
against
a
senator
or
asking
that
the
subpoena
he
issued
just
like
the
writ
in
kilbourn
versus
thompson
is
unconstitutional.
because
there's
a
big
distinction
between
actual
speech
and
debate
and
even
committee
reports
as
in
doe
versus
mcmillan
and
the
process,
the
legal
process
that
goes
out
beyond
the
halls
of
the
senate
or
beyond
the
halls
of
the
house
is
no
longer
an
intramural
activity
carried
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
well,
that's
exactly
it,
it
goes
beyond
the
congress.
it
goes
into
the
world
at
large
where
it
will
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
that's
the
same
thing.
you
mean
if
they
just
call
him
on
the
telephone
and
say
we've
got
the
subpoena
would
you
please
come
down
or
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
then
its
exactly
the
same
kind
of
thing.
its
bar,
its
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
thing.
presumably
what
we're
getting
an
injunction
--
well,
we
weren't
--
ms.
nancy
stearns
--
able
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
bank.
pardon
me?
ms.
nancy
stearns
we
would
again
ask
--
well,
if
we
could
serve
the
bank
properly
in
our
situation
we
couldn't
have
unless
we
waited
at
the
door
for
chemical
bank
to
come
down
and
appear.
chemical
bank
was
kind
enough
to
notify
us
so
that
we
could
in
fact
go
into
court
prior
to
that
time
but
we
could
not
serve
chemical
bank
in
new
york
to
make
them
a
party
in
the
first
place.
ms.
nancy
stearns
oh,
certainly
not,
that's
certainly
just
the
same,
i
mean
when
i
said
the
halls
of
congress,
i
mean
when
congress
or
a
congressional
committee
is
in
session,
however,
that
does
bring
up
the
distinction
that
was
made
in
the
doe
versus
mcmillan
case.
for
example,
if
a
house
member
or
a
senate
member
is
to
read
a
libelous
report
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
he
is
clearly
immune.
if
he
takes
that
same
report
and
goes
to
his
home
territory
and
reads
it
again,
he
is
no
longer
immune.
so
there
is
a
distinction
of
internal
and
external.
ms.
nancy
stearns
i
think
that
it's
both.
it's
a
concept
of
what
is
an
internal
function
and
when
it
loses
its
internal
nature.
ms.
nancy
stearns
that
i
think
is
one
distinction
your
honor
but
i
think
there
was
also
another
distinction
when
the
court
said
that
in
fact
the
question
of
republication
could
be
looked
into.
and
whether
or
not
the
republication
in
fact
went
beyond
what
would
normally
considered
an
internal
function.
we
would
therefore
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
opinion
of
judge
tuttle
below
both
as
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
the
first
amendment
issue.
thank
you.
