unknown
speaker
well
mr.
miller,
you
said
i
gather
that
the
--
the
banks
aren't
here,
they
didn't
appeal
what?
unknown
speaker
from
what?
what
was
entered
against
--
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
judgment
against
the
bank?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
the
--
if
the
--
on
remand
those
are
open,
whatever
remedy
they
should
appeal
with
regards
the
banks?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
should
reverse
that
mr.
miller,
you'll
still
be
in
this
lawsuit
something
that
will
involves
the
banks?
unknown
speaker
so
even
if
you
win
this
lawsuit
is
not
completely
over?
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
do
in
that
circumstance,
your
--
unknown
speaker
--
victory
on
the
speech
and
debate
clause
will
not
assist
the
bank
statutes.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
lose
out
here,
that's
the
end
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
i
take
it
that
if
you
lose
on
the
immunity
question,
the
case
is
over?
unknown
speaker
what
if
--
it's
over
as
against
these
--
the
congressional
party?
unknown
speaker
well
that
--
either
reading
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
for
what?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
could
--
do
you
think
you
could
get
an
injunction
against
the
congress
attempting
internally
to
make
a
defense?
unknown
speaker
are
you
against
the
senators?
unknown
speaker
oh,
no?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gutman,
i'm
confused
about
--
we
have
four
cases
here,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
any
of
them
has
a
bank
conserved,
didn't
you
mention
that
the
district
of
columbia
have
any?
unknown
speaker
and
now,
we
have
to
reach
the
first
amendment
issue
at
least
in
that
case
or
in
those
two
cases?
unknown
speaker
the
bank.
unknown
speaker
the
cases
are
stay,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
which
one
is
that?
unknown
speaker
though
i
don't
waste
the
time
to
--
unknown
speaker
that's
people's
coalition
for
peace
and
justice?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
--
you
may
not
agree
at
all
that
the
cases,
the
house
cases
are
not
moot?
unknown
speaker
and
now
the
--
now
this
committee
has
disbanded
or
--
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
asking
--
would
you
suggest
they
didn't
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they're
moot?
unknown
speaker
if
they
are
moot,
it's
not
for
you
tell
us
what
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
not
in
the
house
case?
unknown
speaker
its
power
or
whatever
left
of
those
powers,
if
there's
anything,
they're
now
what,
were
they
committee
on
judiciary?
unknown
speaker
to
think
about
it,
a
subpoena
from
the
committee
on
judiciary?
unknown
speaker
yes
and
it
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
--
should
we
just
--
be
just
forget
the
house
case?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know
but
let's
assume
that
the
only
case
in
which
you
would've
--
let's
assume
you
lose
on
the
immunity
case,
let's
just
assume
that.
and
then
the
senate
case
is
over.
unknown
speaker
i
--
now,
what
about
the
house
cases?
unknown
speaker
if
they
are
moot,
you
say
but
don't
treat
them
if
you
lose
--
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you'd
be
that
the
very
satisfied
if
these
cases
were
moot?
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
the
senate
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
--
is
that
in
the
one
with
the
district
of
columbia
bank
in
it?
