justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
miller,
this
is
really
a
separate
argument
than
from
your
speech
and
debate
clause
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
if
you
win
on
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
these
records
are
protected
or
not,
i
presume?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
knew
--
you
never
got
to
the
third
party
question
here
did
you
because
the
banks
were
never
served?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
get
to
the
point
according
to
the
record
where
the
banks
were
about
to
produce
the
records?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
senate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
ask
you
again,
would
you,
are
you
insisting
that
you're
entitled
to
a
judgement
like
that
against
the
senators?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
there
are
more
than
that
too
aren't
they
mr.
gutman,
they
have
got
financial
information
in
addition
to
ways
of
identifying
members?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
thing
that
struck
me
about
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
was
the
absence
from
it
of
any
of
the
balancing
type
of
reasoning
that
you
get
on
the
barenblatt
case
and
other
types
of
that,
where
you're
saying
basically
what
is
congress
is
trying
to
do,
what
are
the
first
amendment
interest
quite
apart
from
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
it
seemed
to
me
the
court
of
appeals
just
concluded
your
clients
did
have
a
first
amendment
interest
therefore
that
--
it
was
all
over?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
lost
both
the
trials,
didn't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
the
fact
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
doesn't
apply
to
actions
for
declaratory
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
because
congress
--
that's
because
congress
then
seeks
the
aid
of
the
courts
in
order
to
enforce
its
subpoena.
here,
you
haven't
waited
till
that
stage.
you're
asking
the
judiciary
to
intervene
before
the
congressional
process
has
even
begun?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
one
would
contend
that
the
actions
of
the
justice
department
and
the
executive
branch
in
prosecuting
a
defendant
who's
been
cited
by
the
congress
for
contempt
is
a
part
of
the
congressional
function
and
that's
why
--
that
never
arises
in
those
cases.
they're
always
allowed
to
challenge
the
constitutionality.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
in
quite
a
different
situation
here?
