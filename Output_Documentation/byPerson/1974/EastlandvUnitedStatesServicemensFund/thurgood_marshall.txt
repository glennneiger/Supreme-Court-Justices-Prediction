justice

any
of
these
organizations,
membership
corporations
under
the
new

state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
same
cause
you
can
get
it
if
your
membership
card
is
under
new
york,
all
you
have
to
do
is
be
a

and
you
can
get
the
whole
membership
list?

could
a
member
of
the

the
membership
list?
justice
thurgood
marshall
join.
is
it
open
to
the
public
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
there
were
no
staff
members
involved,
its
just
the
congress
committee
chairman
issued
the
subpoena
or
himself
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
think
he
was
protected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
since

justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
when

you
mean
it
could
be

justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
he
could
be
questioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
what
basis
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
goes
to
the
bank,
its
all
--
as
it
goes
out
of
the
hall,
it
doesn't
go
out
there,
they
send
a
subpoena
to
the
bank
and
the
bank
sends
them
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suppose
--
they
suppose
--
does
the
subpoena
tell
them
to
bring
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
may
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
get
an
injunction
against
them
in
bringing
them
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice

justice
thurgood
marshall
the
injunction
says
to
the
bank,
bring
us
--
bring
your
records
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
court
please,
depending
on
what
transpires
with
respect
to
the
committee,
i
feel
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of
the
status
with
respect
to
what
congress
has
done
and
be
the
fact
that
damages,
i
just
want
to
clear
the
record
of,
the
damages
and
that's
a
general
request
for
damages
in
paragraph
of
28
(a)
of
two
of
the
complaints.
justice
thurgood
marshall

in
the
senate
case,
no
sir.
