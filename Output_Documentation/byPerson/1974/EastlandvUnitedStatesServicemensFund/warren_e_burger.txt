we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1923,
eastland
against
servicemen's
fund.
mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

mr.
miller,
i
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
know
whether
it's
of
any
importance
or
not
but
since
the
question
arose
and
you
have
undertaken
to
answer
it
about
the
subpoena,
i
have
thought
and
i
find
that
my
memory
was
correct
that
on
page
13
of
the
appendix
there
is
an
allegation,
paragraph
nine
at
the
bottom
that
the
senate
committee,
subcommittee
caused
to
be
served
on
the
chemical
bank
of
new
york,
the
subpoena
duces
tecum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we're
just
concern
with
the
one
on
16.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
impact
right
today,
here
and
now
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
senators?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gutman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
us
to
decide
for
all
time
whether
bodies
of
the
house
of
senate
may
issue
subpoenas
against
bank
records
for
bank
records?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sounded
like
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
stearns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whether
to
pursue
that
analogy,
if
it's
in
--
offered
as
an
analogy,
the
case
you
referred
to
seemed
--
seems
to
me
to
have
held
that
when
the
judicial
branch
needs
records
to
perform
its
function,
the
judicial
branch
will
get
them
no
matter
where
they
are?
now,
if
the
legislative
branch
needs
certain
records
to
perform
its
function,
certainly
an
argument
could
be
made
that
the
legislative
branch
shall
get
them
wherever
they
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
power
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
to
narrow
the
scope
of
the
subpoena
so
as
in
its
view
to
avoid
disclosing
membership
as
such?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
another
factor
here.
you
speak
of
having
a
first
amendment
rights
chilled,
isn't
there
perhaps
a
corollary
that
if
senators
and
congressmen
who
caused
subpoenas
to
be
issued
find
that
district
courts
are
entering
injunctions
against
them
would
the
threatening
over
them
over
the
contempt
power
to
be
asserted
against
the
senator
or
a
congressman
that
that
may
chill
senators
and
congressmen
from
the
performance
of
their
legislative
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
answers
the
problem
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
suggested
something
that
indicated
a
limitation
that
certain
acts
had
to
occur
in
the
halls
of
congress.
if
a
committee,
subcommittee
holds
a
meeting
in
san
francisco
or
anywhere
else
in
the
united
states,
is
that
any
less
protected
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
because
of
the
four
walls
and
the
ceiling
or
is
that
because
he
is
not
performing
a
legislative
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
read
that
case
closely
you
will
see
that
it
relates
to
the
fact
that
the
congressmen
that
might
be
using
that
as
part
of
a
campaign
for
reelection
and
that
that's
the
distinction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
miller,
do
you
--
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
one
of
these
cases,
was
there
not
at
least
a
strong
intimation
that
a
member
of
a
congress
served
with
a
claim
directed
against
an
utterance
right
within
the
four
walls
of
the
congress
to
make
it
clear,
could
totally
ignore
the
process
and
if
the
judge
--
any
judgment
was
entered
against
him
would
be
analogy,
isn't
there
some
implication
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
was
just
a
literal
language
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
that
shall
not
be
called
to
answer
would
be
brought
enough
to
mean
he
didn't
have
to
answer
a
complaint
in
a
district
court
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen,
thank
you
ms.
stearns.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
to
announce
in
73-1923,
eastland
against
united
states
servicemen's
fund.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
the
senate
aspect
of
the
case
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
entry
of
a
judgment
directing
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
the
house
aspects
of
this
case
are
remanded
with
directions
to
return
to
the
district
court
for
further
consideration
consistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
with
whom
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
joined
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
