mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
before
this
court
are
the
internal
security
committee
of
the
senate,
his
chairman
senator
eastland
and
several
senators
along
with
the
general
counsel
of
the
subcommittee,
mr.
sourwine.
there
are
three
additional
cases
involved
in
this
petition.
these
petitioners
are
the
internal
security
committee
of
the
house
of
representative,
several
individual
congressmen
members
of
that
committee,
the
general
counsel
and
the
investigator
of
that
committee.
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
just
recently
the
house
of
representatives
has
voted
to
transfer
the
functions
of
the
internal
security
committee
of
the
house
of
representative
to
another
committee.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
creates
a
question
of
mootness
in
the
case
here
where
the
one
reason
if
for
no
other
as
i
read
the
complaints
in
those
three
cases
as
not
only
asking
damages
specifically
against
the
general
counsel
and
investigator
of
that
committee
but
also
requesting
damages
against
the
individual
congressmen
members.
in
any
event,
the
main
case,
the
united
states
servicemen's
fund
versus
eastland
does
not
have
that
problem.
the
question,
the
basic
question
at
issue
here
is
at
another
chapter
and
one
that
this
court
has
faced
on
several
occasions
as
to
the
power
of
a
coordinate
branch
of
our
government.
here
at
issue
is
a
subpoena
that
was
served
by
the
senate,
internal
security
committee
pursuant
to
a
resolution
upon
a
bank.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
who
served
the
subpoena.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
do
not
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
have
assumed
that
the
chairman
did
not.
all
i
can
go
by
is
what
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
mr.
justice
white,
which
says
as
to
the
third
subpoena,
which
is
the
only
subpoena
before
this
court
that
the
defendant,
which
could
be
senator
eastland
and
the
other
senators
and
defendant
sourwine,
“caused
the
subpoena
to
be
issued.”
i
find
that
in
paragraph
16
of
the
complaint.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
as
i
read
the
complaint
sir,
it
does
not
and
i
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
believe,
i
believe
the
record
is
silent
on
that
point.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
defendant
caused
the
subpoena
“to
be
issued.”
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
complaint
then
goes
on
and
alleges
that
the
subpoena
is
void
under
the
first,
fourth,
fifth,
sixth
and
ninth
amendments
and
says
that
the
--
and
the
tenth
amendment
and
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
subpoena
is
to
chill
the
first
amendment
right
of
the
united
states
servicemen's
fund.
now,
the
relief
requested
in
the
complaint
is
that
the
chemical
bank
to
whom
the
subpoena
was
addressed
and
the
senators
and
the
staff
be
enjoined
from
seeking
to
enforce
the
subpoena
and
also
to
have
the
subpoena
declared
null
and
void.
the
records
sought
were
--
according
to
the
evidence
adduced
at
the
preliminary
hearing
before
the
district
court
and
the
record
is
quite
sparse
on
that
apparently
dealt
with
the
normal
bank
records,
cancelled
or
copies
of
cancelled
check,
bank
statements,
although
the
record
is
very,
very
weak
on
this
point.
also,
there
is
no
showing
as
to
the
number
or
amount
of
the
record
that
were
in
fact
in
the
hands
and
the
custody
of
the
bank.
it
is
however
clear
--
it
is
however
clear
and
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
case
that
the
plaintiffs
below
and
respondents
here
were
seeking
records
belonging
to
the
bank,
the
recipient
of
the
subpoena
and
were
not
seeking
to
enjoin
the
production
of
records
which
in
fact
belong
to
them.
the
respondent
here
is
a
non-profit
corporation.
it
has
a
tax
exempt
certificate
and
has
in
fact
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
service
returns
which
specify
certain
contributors
to
this
organization.
the
activity
of
the
united
states
servicemen's
fund
as
shown
by
the
evidence
in
the
court
below
was
to
establish
coffee
houses
adjacent
to
military
bases
and
to
have
discussions
with
respect
to
many
items
controversial
or
not.
there
was
also
a
demonstration
that
the
primary
function
of
this
committee
was
or
the
fund
to
discuss
and
the
vietnam
war
and
to
take
whatever
steps
they
could
take
by
terms
of
persuasion,
education
and
similar
steps
to
demonstrate
that
the
vietnam
war
was
one
--
was
--
should
not
be
a
part
of
the
american
effort.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
your
honor,
that
is
the
fist
subpoena.
there
are
three
subpoenas
that
were
served
in
this
case.
the
first
was
withdrawn.
i
believe
that
allegation
refers
to
that
subpoena,
that
subpoena
was
withdrawn.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
we
are
just
concern
with
the
third
subpoena.
the
second
subpoena
was
served
but
the
time
to
comply
was
so
short
that
at
the
request
of
the
servicemen's
fund,
the
committee
withdrew
the
second
subpoena
and
then
the
third
subpoena
issue.
and
as
i
say,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
the
only
allegation
is
that
defendants
caused
the
subpoena
to
be
issued
and
that
sir
is
the
third
subpoena.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
there
was
no
immunity
attaching
to
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners
in
this
cause
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
clearly
demonstrate
that
there
is
in
fact
senatorial
immunity
with
respect
to
the
authorization
of
this
investigation.
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
and
in
fact
i
would
go
one
step
further
even
though
the
fact
is
not
in
the
record
and
say
with
respect
to
the
service
of
the
subpoena.
this
court
in
gravel
and
in
doe
versus
mcmillan
has
given
a
careful
and
thoughtful
consideration
to
the
requirements
of
the
coordinate
branch
of
government,
namely
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
participate
in
their
legislative
proceeding
without
fear
--
without
fear
of
either
intimidation
by
the
executive
or
being
called
before
as
the
case
would
say
a
potentially
hostile
judiciary.
and
they
have
gone
further.
the
cases
have
gone
further
and
say
--
and
in
addition
to
that,
members
of
congress
should
not
be
burdened
with
the
difficulty
of
defending
suits
which
are
brought
against
them
for
acts
performed
in
the
legislatives
sphere.
thus,
we
already
have
the
fact
that
voting,
committee
reports,
authorizing
committee
investigations
and
receiving
materials
pursuant
thereto,
introducing
material
at
committee
hearing,
referring
the
committee
reports
to
the
speaker.
distributing
and
using
reports
for
legislative
purposes
are
all
within
the
legislative
sphere
and
immune
from
any
kind
of
action
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
furthermore,
if
we
prescient
from
doe
versus
mcmillan
and
the
gravel
case,
and
go
back
to
the
case
of
dombrowski
versus
eastland
and
examine
what
was
held
there
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
fact
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
we
will
find
that
the
allegation
in
that
case
was
that
the
defendants
tortuously
conspired
to
subpoena
records
in
an
illegal
manner
from
a
louisiana
and
american
activity
committee
who
had
records
belonging
to
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case.
the
court
of
appeals
gladly
held
that
the
action
pursuant
to
that
subpoena
insofar
as
the
senator
and
the
general
counsel
of
the
committee
were
concerned
were
absolutely
and
totally
immune.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
--
i
mean
the
supreme
court
affirmed
that
part
of
the
decision
which
dealt
with
the
senator
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
connect
him
with
any
of
the
activities
with
the
exception
of
the
authorization
of
the
subpoena
and
authorizing
its
service.
that
case
is
a
flat
holding
that
the
conduct
here
is
not
subject
to
review
but
is
totally
immune
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
the
other
factor
which
can
be
drawn
from
decisions
of
this
court,
the
doe
case
and
gravel
is
that
even
unconstitutional
conduct
by
members
of
the
congress
and
reading
those
cases,
their
aide,
if
within
the
legislative
sphere
are
not
subject
to
review
by
this
court
or
any
other
form,
that
is
the
holding
of
those
cases.
furthermore,
presenting
from
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
going
to
the
basis
of
the
coordinate
branch
of
government
theory
namely
separation
of
powers,
the
doctrine
which
was
discussed
in
the
doe
case
along
with
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
within
the
gravel
case
points
out
that
the
judiciary
where
there
is
an
immunity
such
as
it
exist
under
the
facts
of
this
case
may
not
interfere
with
the
action
of
congress.
on
this,
i
should
emphasize
as
this
court
did
in
mcgrain
versus
daugherty
that
the
absolute
necessity
for
an
informed
congress
is
the
ability
to
subpoena
individuals
and
subpoena
documents
and
that
any
inhibition
on
that
power
is
in
fact
an
inhibition
on
the
ability
to
legislate
wisely.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
the
document
subpoenaed
in
this
case
were
bank
records
and
that
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
before
the
district
court,
district
court
judge
gasch
demonstrated
that
the
--
what
the
really
real
concern
of
the
respondents
here
were
in
fact
loss
of
contributions.
thus
we
had
testimony
by
professional
fundraisers
and
by
representatives
of
this
organization,
that
there
were
anonymous
contribution,
there
were
contributions
by
cashier's
check
from
brokerage
accounts.
there
were
contributions
from
corporations
that
were
“fronts”
from
individuals
and
in
fact
there
was
one
example
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
hypothetical
or
not
where
the
individual
testified
that
the
real
anonymity
was
achieved
where
you
had
lunch
with
the
donor
and
took
cash
at
the
lunch
table.
these
were
the
types
of
anonymous
contributions
which
the
respondents
apparently
felt
would
be
disclosed
should
the
bank
records
be
made
public.
although
i
hasten
to
add
the
record
does
not
show
what
the
bank
records
in
fact
contained
with
respect
to
the
names
of
contributors
or
not.
this
brings
us
to
a
very
interesting
part
of
this
case
because
here
we
have
an
attempt
to
equate
the
raising
of
funds,
the
contributing
of
money
by
a
non-profit,
tax
exempt
by
a
ruling
organization
and
as
distinguished
from
any
showing
that
the
membership
of
that
organization
is
connected
with
or
tied
to
contributions.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
and
i
must
emphasize
to
the
court
in
the
brief
filed
by
respondents,
they
say
that
page
41,
42
or
43
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
was
not
mentioned
by
the
government
who
represented
the
respondents
before
the
court
of
appeal.
and
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
the
brief
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
these
respondents
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
is
a
long
and
extensive
section
on
the
speech
and
debate
clause
citing
dombrowski,
doe
v.
mcmillan
and
all
of
the
other
cases.
i
would
not
want
the
court
to
think
that
this
issue
was
one
just
raised
before
this
court
because
it
had
been
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
in
fact
before
this
court.
but
we
are
now
in
a
position
where
what
the
respondents
are
arguing
and
have
argued
is
that
bank
records
which
show
potentially
the
source
of
contributors
if
they
not
be
in
cash
is
something
which
is
covered
by
the
first
amendment,
freedom
of
association
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
nowhere
has
this
court
or
to
my
knowledge
any
other
court
gone
so
far.
if
in
fact
records
of
a
bank
which
deal
with
moneys
received
by
an
organization,
whether
it
be
the
united
states
servicemen's
fund
or
perhaps
the
republican
or
the
democratic
party.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that's
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
that's
what
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
under
kilbourn
versus
thompson,
that
is
precisely
the
situation
as
applied
here.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
in
fact
it
is
beyond
the
legislative
sphere.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
he
can
be
enjoined.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
my
argument,
if
the
court
please
is
that
it
is
not.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
would
--
that
is
a
part
--
that
is
a
part
of
the
equation
if
the
court
please
where
eventually
you
would
end
up.
can
a
third
party
who
controls
the
records
in
fact
be
enjoined
but
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
remember
your
language
very
well.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
banks
were
in
fact
defendants
in
this
suit,
they
just
did
not
participate
in
the
appeal.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
in
one
of
the
house
of
representative
cases,
one
or
more
the
bank
did
in
fact
produced
some
of
the
records.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
but
those
three
cases,
i
want
to
emphasize
to
the
court
really
are
--
whether
a
part
of
this
case
they're
in
effect
tag
along
because
everyone
has
treated
the
eastland
case
as
the
case
that
governs
all
of
them.
even
though
when
you
get
down
into
the
facts
you
realize
there
are
some
different
factors
with
respect
to
the
other
three
but
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
--
well,
the
district
court
did
not
deal
with
the
house
of
representative
cases,
they
went
before
other
judges
and
were
--
the
subpoenas
were
enjoined
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
--
have
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
the
eastland
subpoena.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
mr.
justice,
let
me,
of
course
it
cannot
claim
legislative
immunity
but
the
case
you
put
it
would
be
fine
and
if
that
is
--
if
that
is
the
way
the
court
will
treat
the
opinion
below
and
leave
within
the
legislative
sphere,
the
senators
and
the
aides
because
they
were
in
fact
totally
immune
by
their
activities
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause
then
and
only
then
do
we
address
the
question,
does
their
stand
can
an
individual
whose
records
are
with
the
bank,
file
some
type
of
an
action
against
the
bank,
a
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
and
that
sir
is
a
--
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
before
the
court
today.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
would
not
argue
that
to
the
court
because
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no
sir,
not
at
all.
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
under
the
concept
of
separation
and
powers,
the
individual
senators
and
congressman
and
their
staff
aides
and
counsel
under
the
facts
of
this
case
are
totally
immune
from
the
conduct
alleged
here
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
that
is
i
think
a
flat
--
that
is
my
flat
position
and
is
one
that
is
supported
by
existing
case
law,
recent
and
past.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
they
are
--
the
court
of
appeals
reinstate
--
they
were
--
the
senators
were
dismissed
as
defendant
by
the
trial
court.
the
court
of
appeals
reinstated
them
suggest
--
and
sent
the
case
back
for
further
proceeding
suggesting
that
if
some
type
of
relief
was
necessary
against
the
senators
that
perhaps
and
they
picked
up
a
suggestion
that
a
declaratory
judgment
had
been
requested,
perhaps
it
would
be
appropriate
to
enter
a
declaratory
judgment.
however,
there
was
no
requirement
as
i
read
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
it'd
be
limited
to
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
they
did
not
appeal.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
they
did
--
they
took
no
steps
with
respect
to
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
was
the
--
there
was
no
judgment
against
the
bank.
the
court
denied
the
motion
for
injunction
against
the
senate
committee
and
the
senators.
they
--
senators
appealed.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
sent
the
case
back.
the
banks
did
not
to
my
knowledge
participate
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
would
--
i'd
really
don't
understand
quite
where
the
banks
fit
in
to
this
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
authorized
the
judgment
against
the
senators
and
if
i
say
so
myself,
it
would
be
the
only
time
to
my
knowledge
that
any
such
type
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
banks
are
as
i
understand
it
are
still
defendants
and
could
be
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
--
i
assume
that
they
could
still
proceed
with
against
the
bank,
just
do
it
to
--
the
banks
are
defendants
in
the
lawsuit
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
think
not
your
honor,
i
would
think
not.
but
let
me
address
myself
to
the
--
quickly
to
the
first
amendment
question
here
because
i
don't
think
presenting
from
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
first
amendment
question
here.
because
if
bank
records
are
covered
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution,
then
this
court
is
going
to
face
that
issue
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
political
contribution
by
your
major
political
parties.
and
i
was
--
submit
if
the
court
please
that
if
you
can
bar
the
production
of
records,
of
contribution
because
of
associational
concepts
under
the
first
amendment,
then
the
reform
legislation
with
respect
to
campaign
contribution
is
going
to
be
a
matter
that
we're
going
to
have
to
be
separated
or
going
to
have
to
be
ruled
is
not
covered,
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
very
briefly
if
the
court
please.
in
the
joint
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals
case,
i
found
the
complaints
with
the
three
house
of
representative
cases
and
i
think
if
the
court
will
examine
those,
they
will
find
the
damages
were
in
fact
requested
$500,000.00
against
the
defendant's
pot
and
the
sanders
as
well
as
the
bank
and
additional,
in
paragraph
28th
--
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir,
one
--
yes,
the
house
of
representative
cases.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
call
the
court
with
respect
--
attention
with
respect
to
declaratory
judgments
is
that
this
court
has
said
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
protects
congressmen
not
only
from
the
consequences
of
litigation
results
but
also
from
the
burden
of
defending
suits,
indeed
the
clause
would
“be
of
little
value
of
legislators
could
be
subjected
to
the
cost
and
inconvenience
and
distractions
of
a
trial
upon
the
conclusions
of
the
plea.”
i
submit
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
don't
recall
that
sir.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
would
in
fact
would
be
a
totally
--
not
only
because
it
would
bring
into
total
conflict.
the
judicial
branch
which
had
entered
the
judgment
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
would
interpret
it
that
way,
on
the
other
hand
there
had
been
decisions
which
suggest
that
at
minimum
and
or
at
maximum
the
senator
or
the
congressman
is
required
to
at
least
file
a
motion
to
dismiss.
a
suggestion
is
not
--
not
been
a
holding.
thank
you.
