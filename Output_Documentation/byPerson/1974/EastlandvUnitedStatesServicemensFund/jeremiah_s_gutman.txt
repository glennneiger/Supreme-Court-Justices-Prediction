mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subpoenas
in
each
of
these
cases
were
in
fact
served
and
the
record
is
very
clear
that
they
were
in
fact
served.
the
problem
as
to
the
banks
is
jurisdictional.
the
whole
series
of
these
actions
were
begone.
the
first
one
was
--
is
not
now
before
the
court,
it
was
an
action
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
called
liberation
news
service
which
held
that
new
york
was
the
improper
venue
for
bringing
an
action
to
get
a
determination
of
the
validity
of
such
as
subpoenas
we
have
involved
in
this
cases.
therefore,
the
matter
how
to
come
down
to
the
district.
in
the
prime
case
here,
u.s.
servicemen's
fund,
the
fund
is
the
new
york
city
bank,
chemical
bank,
new
york
trust
company
which
is
not
present
in
the
district
of
columbia.
because
of
the
exigencies
of
time
that
is
that
the
subpoena
was
served
and
was
returnable
so
quickly
are
and
the
fact
that
part
of
the
information
was
in
fact
delivered
by
a
bank
before
the
depositor
had
notice
of
the
service
of
the
subpoena,
a
quick
action
had
to
be
brought
and
so
an
action
was
immediately
brought
in
the
district
without
even
attempting
to
get
jurisdiction
in
the
district
of
columbia
over
the
new
york
bank,
was
brought
on
quickly
before
the
trial
court.
a
temporary
stay
was
denied
and
an
emergency
stay
was
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
an
issue
was
joined
in
that
way.
because
the
--
in
one
of
the,
in
two
rather,
in
two
of
the
three
house
cases,
the
bank
is
a
district
of
columbia
bank
so
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
--
over
those
banks
in
those
cases
but
that's
not
so
in
the
prime
case,
u.s.
servicemen's
fund.
chemical
bank
new
york
trust
company
is
not
before
the
court
because
it
was
never
properly
served.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
congressional
parties
and
staff.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
yes
your
honor.
what
the
--
what
judge
tuttle
for
the
circuit
ordered
in
his
remand
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
we
have
to
win
your
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
if
they
are
immune
from
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief,
we
don't
even
ask
for
damages
and
mr.
miller
has
misread
our
complaint,
we
didn't
ask
for
damages,
we
never
did.
if
there
is
immunity
of
the
--
either
the
staff
or
the
congress
members
or
both
as
to
execution
of
process
with
respect
to
declaration
or
injuction,
we're
dead,
sure.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
well,
right.
i
have
to
reach
the
first
amendment
question
to
say
--
to
show
that
process
that
i
ought
to
get
a
declaration
or
an
injunction,
right.
but
if
i
--
if
these
people
are
immune
from
judicial
review
of
their
actions
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
enforcing
the
subpoena.
the
subpoena
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
no,
no,
i
can't
--
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
could
prevent
the
congress,
the
congressional
subcommittee
or
committee
from
voting
to
refer
for
contempt
up
the
line
from
subcommittee
to
committee
to
house
etcetera.
but
i
do
think
as
in
stamler
against
willis
in
chicago,
you
could
get
an
injunction
against
prosecution
and
that
was
done
in
that
case
by
adding
the
prosecutor.
now,
what
judge
tuttle
did
here
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
in
that
case
the
senators
were
found
not
to
be
necessary
parties.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
no.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
at
this
point,
no
your
honor.
at
this
point,
no.
what
i
think
happened
here
is
when
judge
tuttle
ordered
a
remand,
what
he
said
was,
i'm
going
to
put
this
congressional
people
back
so
that
there
can
be
a
hearing
in
the
district
to
fashion
whatever
relief
maybe
appropriate
depending
upon
what
can
be
developed
as
to
the
procedures
and
responsibilities
of
the
various
staff
members
of
the
committee.
and
he
said,
the
district
court
should
be
generous
in
adding
whatever
parties
maybe
necessary
in
order
to
give
relief.
and
those
are
staff
people.
and
i
think
complete
relief
could
be
granted
once
we
know
the
facts.
if
the
court
please,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
our
arrangement
had
been
that
miss
stearns
was
going
to
deal
with
speech
or
debate
and
i
was
going
to
deal
with
first
amendment
and
the
other
issues
that
i
see
--
in
response
to
your
honors
questions
will
be
getting
into
her
territory.
so,
if
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
her
responses
in
this
area.
and,
but
of
course,
the
first
amendment
issue
is
basic
to
the
whole
thing.
if
you
buy
mr.
miler's
argument
that
bank
records
of
a
membership
organization
are
not
protected
by
the
alabama
and
louisiana
and
florida
and
so
on
cases
and
particularly
the
arkansas
case,
pollard
against
roberts,
well
then
we
are
finished,
we'll
never
reached
speech
or
debate.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
contemporary
society
where
it
is
impossible
to
function
without
using
the
facilities
of
a
bank
to
clear
your
funds,
whether
they
are
cash
funds
taken
with
a
luncheon
table
as
mr.
miller
suggest
or
the
cashier's
checks,
brokerage
checks,
the
direct
checks
from
individuals
who
are
identifiable.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
these
checks
are
microfilmed
and
its
these
very
microfilms
which
were
requested
in
the
very
broad
subpoena
which
was
served
in
these
cases.
those
bank
records
in
effect
are
the
membership
list
and
in
pollard
against
roberts
which
this
court
affirmed,
the
three-judge
court,
i'm
basing
on
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
said,
it
was
exactly
the
case,
it
was
a
republican
party
of
arkansas.
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
subpoena
the
bank
records
and
at
the
suit
of
an
officer
of
the
republican
party
intervening
as
the
real
party
at
interest
just
as
u.s.
servicemen's
fund
here
comes
in
as
the
real
party
in
interest.
the
court
held
that
indeed
the
bank
records
are
precisely
the
equivalent
in
the
naacp
list
in
the
alabama
and
florida
cases.
and
that
they
should
--
the
production
thereof
was
enjoined
and
i
see
no
distinction
here.
and
if
this
kind
of
thing,
this
kind
of
protection
is
not
afforded
to
bank
records,
given
modern
society
and
the
manner
in
which
practically
all
membership
organizations
worked,
you
going
to
be
able
to
destroy
membership
organization
anonymity
and
privacy.
almost
every
membership
organization
must
maintain
not
only
a
bank
account
in
which
the
depositor's
checks
are
--
and
routinely
microfilm
so
that
the
name
and
address
of
the
drawer
of
each
item
is
available.
but
they
also
maintain
their
membership
list
upon
computerized
banks
for
purposes
of
sending
out
their
proportional
mailing
and
their
dues,
notices
and
whatever
else
they
do.
these
things
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
membership
list
which
before
modern
mechanics
of
office
management
were
maintained
in
a
secretary's
file
drawer
in
the
office
of
the
organization
itself.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
of
course
they
have.
the
problem
here
is,
if
the
subpoena
had
been
served
upon
the
organization
itself
and
warned
as
were
broad
ranging
as
it
is
then
we
got
a
good
fourth
amendment
argument
against
the
subpoena
too
of
course.
the
organization
would
be
able
to
respond
and
to
say
these
much,
we
think
you're
entitled
too
and
these
much
we
think
you're
not.
if
as
is
alleged
in
the
arguments
in
the
lower
courts
here
and
as
stressed
in
the
judge
mackinnon's
dissent
below,
what
they're
really
after
is
to
find
out
whether
there
are
subversive
contributors
or
foreign
governmental
contributors
to
this
plaintiff
or
the
respondent
here
then
the
question
could
be
addressed
in
just
that
way.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
yes
because
the
burden
is
on
the
government.
there
was
a
trial
here,
there
were
two
trials,
it
was
a
trial
on
the
preliminary
injunction
and
that
was
remanded
with
the
stay
by
the
court
of
appeals,
when
that
was
denied
and
this
court
of
appeals
reversed
it
and
sent
it
back,
it
was
a
stay
and
said
hold
the
hearing
on
the
ultimate
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
right,
we
lost
both
trials,
however,
we
did
make
a
record
in
which
we
put
in
affirmative,
uncontradicted
proof
as
to
the
first
amendment
delicacy
and
necessity
of
protecting
these
records.
at
the
end
of
our
case,
judge
gasch
said
to
the
government
attorneys,
“do
you
have
any
evidence,
do
you
have
any
witnesses”
and
they
said
no
and
they
rest
it.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
no
sir.
the
ussf,
the
prime
respondent
here
is
a
delaware
membership
corporation.
the
others
i
believe
are
incorporated
associations
in
new
york.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
that's
quite
different
your
honor
from
a
member
who
is
after
all
entitled
under
the
first
amendment
i
would
guess
to
know
with
whom
he's
associating,
that's
one
thing,
it's
another
thing
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
get
that
list.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
sir?
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
could
he
infiltrate
it?
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
surely.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
yes.
in
the
two
--
in
two
of
the
three
house
committee
cases,
a
bank
has
been
served
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
i
guess
you
have
to
reach
the
first
amendment
issue
because
if
we
have
to
prevail
on
the
first
amendment
for
you
to
issue
an
injunction
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
--
even
against
the
bank.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
correct.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
exactly.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
that's
correct
though
we
have
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
i
think
p
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
i
think
its
pcpjnpac,
people's
committee
of
peace
and
justice
and
national
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
yes,
people's
commission
and
national
peace
action.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
i
suspect
they
are
and
we
argued
that
before
for
two
reasons.
the
house
is
not
a
continuing
body.
the
--
these
subpoenas
opinions
were
issued
in
1970,
there
had
been
two
congresses
since
then.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
now
the
committee
doesn't
exist
at
all.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
indeed
the
house
cases
are
moot
though
this
court
has
on
many
occasions.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
no
i
think
not
your
honor
because
the
issue
is
the
kind
of
issue
that
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
well
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
i
understand
that
but
i
can
suggest
that
in
those
cases
where
the
issue
is
likely
to
be
repeated
and
it
is
of
serious
dimension
and
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
tends
to
escape
review
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
well,
that
that
committee
isn't
going
to
issue
any
subpoenas
anymore,
we
know
that.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
judiciary
i
believe
yes,
but
that's
not
clear
because
the
house
isn't
really
organized
yet.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
well,
they'd
have
to
issue
a
new
subpoena
i
suppose
under
a
new
resolution
and
i
guess
we'll
be
back
up
here,
that's
why
i
think
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
to
proceed.
all
the
parties
have
approached
the
matter
as
though
the
house
cases
are
identical
with
the
senate
cases
and
i
think
they
are
except
for
the
fact
that
the
house
is
not
a
continuing
body.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
and
the
senate
of
course
is
a
continuing
body
so
we
don't
have
that
issue
there.
for
all
purposes
below
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
all
agreed
that
it
wasn't
even
worth
printing
the
complaints
in
the
house
cases,
they're
not
even
in
our
joint
appendix
because
everybody
agreed
that
whatever
happened
in
the
senate
case
would
be
binding
on
the
house
issues.
so
even
if
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
i
think
that
they're
tag
along
cases,
no
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
if
indeed
there's
no
way
to
give
us
relief
in
the
senate
case
then
the
senate
case
is
over,
i
cant
see
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
that's
why
i've
said
that
they
should
not
be
treated
as
moot
because
--
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
under
the
--
no,
i
think
they
shouldn't
be
treated
as
moot
in
any
event
your
honor
because
of
the
recurrence
of
the
problem,
that
is
not
--
what
there
is
make
--
whether
the
committee
--
the
subpoena
issued
next
week
is
--
bears
the
imprimatur
over
the
house
internal
security
committee
or
its
old
name,
the
un-american
activities
committee
or
some
new
name
which
i
give
it
next
week.
the
issue
will
really
be
the
same
if
they
try
to
get
the
same
kind
of
issues.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
no,
i
think
that
you
don't
want
that.
the
issue
portended
isn't
that
broad
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jeremiah
s.
gutman
oh,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
a
subpoena
like
this
of
a
membership
corporation
against
their
membership
group
addressed
to
securing
from
its
bank
every
bit
of
paper
and
every
record
that
that
bank
has
concerning
that
organization
that
should
be
declared
to
be
a
void
subpoena.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
such
a
subpoena
against
bank
records
can't
be
narrowly
drawn
and
in
a
proper
case
appropriately
served.
if
they
wanted
to
know
put
for
instance
are
there
any
foreign
government
contributors
to
your
organization,
they
might
have
asked
for
that
kind
of
record.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
organization
itself
has
the
standing
to
make
the
assertion
and
seek
the
relief
even
though
it
is
not
the
record
title
owner
so
to
speak
of
the
documents
at
issue
and
i
believe
they
have
signaled
for
ms.
stearns.
