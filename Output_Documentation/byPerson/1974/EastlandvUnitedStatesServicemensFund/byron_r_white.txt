justice
byron
r.
white
who
served
it
mr.
miller?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
appear
on
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
didn't
mail
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
didn't
mail
it
and
i
don't
suppose
the
chairman
took
it
down
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
--
and
that
is
what
the
injury
is
apparently
just
from
the
issuance,
is
that
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
mr.
miller,
i
am
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
so
sure
about
that
that
if
you
went
on
your
speech
and
debate
clause
issue,
the
case
is
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
if
the,
let's
just
assume
that
the
rights
of
the
organizations
are
violated
by
the
amendment
in
the
sense
--
and
then
the
--
and
that
in
order
to
get
off
the
hook,
you
have
to
plead
legislative
immunity.
let's
just
assume
that.
now,
if
they
send
a
--
if
they
send
a
man
out
to
serve
a
subpoena
or
say
to
serve
a
search
warrant
or
to
make
an
arrest
and
the
arrest
or
the
search
is
unconstitutional,
i
would
suppose
the
fellow
they
sent
to
do
that
could
be
held
liable
for
damages.
that
was
kilbourn
against
thompson.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
then
that
if
the
person
who
is
serving
the
subpoena
is
committing
an
unlawful,
unconstitutional
act,
he
can
only
be
held
liable
for
damages
but
he
can
be
enjoined,
he
can
be
enjoined?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
its
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
i
know,
issuing
the
subpoena
you
say,
stays
within
the
legislative
sphere?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
subpoena
itself
is
--
if
it
invades
some
constitutional
rights
or
some
others,
that
somewhere
along
the
line
that
at
least
where
it
actually
impinges
on
somebody,
kilbourn
against
thompson
would
indicate
that
the
courts
can
intervene.
the
legislators
who
ordered
the
unconstitutional
act
cannot
be
held
in
damage
--
in
liable
for
damages
and
they
can't
be
enjoined
from
issuing
another
one
but
they
--
but
i
would
suppose
the
bank
can
be
enjoined
from
complying?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
in
the
gravel
--
in
gravel
and
the
other
cases
expressly
said
that
a
senator
or
neither
a
senator
nor
his
aides
can
go
out
and
break
in
to
somebody's
house
to
--
illegally
in
order
to
gather
information
for
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
thought
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
miller,
let
me
just
ask,
suppose
the
senators
and
the
congressmen
in
the
committee
had
never
been
parties
to
this
suit?
the
only
party
to
this
suit
was
the
bank
and
the
case,
the
complaint
merely
asks,
well
it
asked
before
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
against
the
bank.
declaratory
judgment
that
being
forced
to
produce
these
records
would
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
organizations
and
would
you
say
that
the
bank
certainly
can't
claim
legislative
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
off
the
--
it
doesn't
get
off
the
hook
just
because
the
senators
might
be
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
thought
you
were
a
while
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
are
the
one
thing
assured
that
that
the
senators
are
kept
in
the
case
and
not
dismissed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
a
judgment
--
there
is
at
least
authorized
the
judgment
to
be
entered
against
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
was
only
in
that
case
--
the
only
parties
are
the
congressional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
--
i
mean,
and
it
include
the
staff.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
even
if
you
did
prevail
on
the
first
amendment
ground
if
the
senators
are
immune
as
respect
to
the
senators?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
immunity
will
not
dispose
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
issue
against
the
bank
then
the
first
amendment
issue
is
still
on
the
case
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
in
the
speech
or
debate
clause
cases
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
clause
has
been
said
to
be
that
senators
and
congressmen
should
not
be
called
into
court
to
even
answer
the
claims
within
the
scope
of
--
within
the
scope
of
the
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
part
of
the
--
that's
just
to
keep
them
from
being
bothered
so
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
(inaudible)
--if
you
are
right,
you
have
to
answer
the
--
you
have
to
hire
a
lawyer,
you
have
to
hire
mr.
miller
or
somebody
and
pay
him
a
lot
of
money
and
take
your
time
and
energies
away
from
your
job?
