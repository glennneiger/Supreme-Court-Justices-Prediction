mr.
cleary,
i
want
to
have
benefit
of
your
thinking
as
to
the
validity
of
a
warrant
procedure
for
fix
checkpoint.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
third
case,
the
united
states
against
brignoni-ponce,
no.
74-114,
presents
an
issue
about
a
different
aspect
of
the
border
patrol's
operations.
respondent's
car
was
stopped
on
a
highway
where
there
was
no
established
checkpoint.
no
search
is
in
issue
in
this
case
because
the
passengers
immediately
admitted
that
they
were
aliens
illegally
in
the
country.
because
a
mere
stop,
the
questioning
about
citizenship
is
less
intrusive
than
a
search,
we
hold
that
the
standard
of
probable
cause
is
not
required.
but
even
random
stops
for
questioning
anywhere
near
the
mexican
border
could
subject
law
abiding
citizens
to
potentially
unlimited
interference
with
their
use
of
the
highways.
we
therefore
hold
that
border
patrol
officers
on
roving
patrol
may
not
stop
a
private
vehicle
unless
they
have
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect
that
it
contained
aliens.
in
this
case,
the
only
reason
for
stopping
respondent's
car
was
that
the
occupants
appeared
to
be
of
mexican
descent.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
alone
does
not
constitute
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
occupants
were
in
fact
aliens.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
the
stop
was
illegal.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice,
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
douglas
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
white
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
filed
an
opinion
also
concurring
in
the
judgment.
